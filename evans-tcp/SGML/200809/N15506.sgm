<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF <HI>WILLIAM LAW,</HI> AUTHOR OF THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS AND DIVERS OTHER RELIGIOUS TRACTS.</HEAD>
<P>HE was born at King's Cliff, a Market-town in Northampton&s;hire, (G. B.) in the Year 1687; his Parents were of good Repute and in Circum&s;tances, which enabled them to give him a liberal Education.&mdash; He was &s;ent early to the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge and was of Emanuel College, where his &s;uperior Genius &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf by three Letters to (Hoadly) the Bi&s;hop of Bangor &s;o greatly, that upon their Publi|cation the celebrated Bi&s;hop Atterbury waited upon him and made him this Compliment; "Mr. Law, from your Writings, in&s;tead of &s;eeing a Youth, I &s;hould have expected to &s;ee grey Hairs." The univer&s;al Applau&s;e tho&s;e three Letters met with, in&s;tead of filling his mind with Pride and Vanity, the too pregnant Attendants of &s;uperior Abilities and human Applau&s;e, only &s;erved to make him the more retired from the World, in order the more deeply to look into him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="019755_0003_0FACAB45E0808A98">He lived a &s;ingle Life, and the la&s;t twenty Years of it in the &s;ame Town in which he was born; but the Rea|&s;ons of his not continuing in the Mini&s;try can only be conjectured: For it is not known that he ever ac|quainted any one with them.</P>
<P>As to his Sentiments concerning all Churches of the pre&s;ent Time, they are &s;ufficiently manife&s;t in his Writ|ings; and they are, that all of them are in a fallen State both with re&s;pect to Doctrine and Practice, having wan|dered very far from the Truth, and the Spirit of the Go&s;pel, placing Religion in a regular round of formal, dull Duties, or Performances, and empty, groundle&s;s Doctrines, in&s;tead of the real Love of God and Man. The fir&s;t Fruits which his Retirement produced were his two excellent Treati&s;es of <HI>Chri&s;tian Perfection</HI> and <HI>Seri|ous Call to a Devout and holy Life</HI>: From the&s;e in&s;tructive Writings, by a gradual Progre&s;s in Spirituality and &s;ound Philo&s;ophy, Providence called him (when he was duly qualified for it) to illu&s;trate and unfold deep my&s;|tic Writings, which he hath done with much Fulne&s;s and Depth of Penetration.</P>
<P>In the Year 1727 he founded a Charity-&s;chool at King's Cliff, and afterwards added two Tenements for two ancient Women with a weekly Allowance.</P>
<P>In the Year 1745, Elizabeth Hutchin&s;on, relict of Archibald Hutchin&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of We&s;tmin&s;ter, founded another School in the &s;ame Place, for the Education and Clothing of eighteen poor Boys, and afterwards added to it four little Tenements for four ancient Widows.&mdash; The&s;e Charities are under the Direction of &s;ix Tru&s;tees, and are always to be appropriated only to the Benefit of the Town of King's Cliff.</P>
<P>The following Circum&s;tances whereby he was ena|bled to be exten&s;ively u&s;eful are remarkable.&mdash;Attend|ing the Fea&s;t of the Sons of the Clergy at St. Paul's Cathedral, a Gentleman who was unknown to him came to him and a&s;ked his Name, to whom he mode&s;tly an|&s;wered, "My Name, Sir, is William Law." Where|upon
<PB N="v" REF="019755_0004_0FACAB475FC368A0">
upon the Gentleman gave him a Letter directed to our Author him&s;elf, which he, for the pre&s;ent, put into his Pocket, and which, upon opening it at a convenient Opportunity, he found inclo&s;ed a Bank Note for one thou&s;and Pounds Sterling: And at another time a Bank Note for five hundred Pounds Sterling, was &s;ent him from an unknown Hand. Note here, that the abovenamed Elizabeth Hutchin&s;on, and &mdash; Gibbons, retiring from the di&s;tracting Cares which attend Gentle|women in high Life, lodged their Money in the Public Funds and lived with W. Law for &s;everal Years before his Death; and afterwards re&s;ided very amicably in the Hou&s;e which he left; never going up to London, but enjoying the Sweets of Retirement.</P>
<P>George Ward, that Self-denying My&s;tic, to whom &s;everal of Law's Letters which have been publi&s;hed are directed, a mo&s;t amiable Man, &s;carce known to the World, commonly vi&s;ited them once a Year.</P>
<P>That truly pious and catholic-&s;pirited Writer, Doctor Philip Doddridge, in a Sermon to young Per&s;ons, has the following Pa&s;&s;age concerning William Law. "It is an <HI>awakening Saying</HI> of one of the mo&s;t lively and pathe|tic, as well as mo&s;t pious, <HI>Writers</HI> which our Age has produced.
<Q>That the <HI>Condition of Man,</HI> in his <HI>natural State,</HI> &s;eems to be like that of a Per&s;on &s;ick of a va|riety of <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> knowing neither his Di&s;temper nor Cure, but unhappily enclo&s;ed in a Place where he could hear, or &s;ee, or ta&s;te, or feel nothing, but what tended to inflame his Di&s;order.</Q>
<HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tian Perfection,</HI> Page, II.</P>
<P>The Writer of the Life of John Buncle,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A noted Dei&s;t.</NOTE> after having unrea&s;onably cen&s;ured William Law, as a <HI>Vi&s;ionary</HI> and Enthu&s;ia&s;t, &amp;c. was obliged to acknowledge the fol|lowing excellent Character of him and of the afore|mentioned Treati&s;es.
<Q>The Reverend Nonjuror, Mr. <HI>WILLIAM LAW,</HI> was a <HI>Man of Sen&s;e,</HI> a <HI>fine Writer</HI> and a <HI>fine Gentleman.</HI> His Temper was charming,
<PB N="vi" REF="019755_0005_0FACAB482023DC08">
&s;weet, and delightful; and his Manners quite pri|mitive, and uncommonly pious: He was all Charity and Goodne&s;s, and &s;o &s;oft and gentle in Conver&s;a|tion, that I have thought my&s;elf in Company with one of the Men of the fir&s;t Church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> while with <HI>him.</HI> He had likewi&s;e the ju&s;te&s;t Noti|ons of <HI>Chri&s;tian Temper</HI> and <HI>Practice,</HI> and recom|mended them in &s;o in&s;inuating a Manner, that even a Rake would hear him with Plea&s;ure? I have not &s;een any Thing like him among the Sons of Men in the&s;e particulars. He was really a very extraordinary Man; and, to his Honour, be it remembered, that he had the <HI>great</HI> Concern of human Life at Heart, took a Deal of Pains in the Pulpit, and from the Pre&s;s, witne&s;s his two fine Books on <HI>Chri&s;tian Per|fection</HI> and a <HI>Devout Life</HI>; to make Men fear God and keep his Commandments. He was a good Man indeed. The&s;e are good Books, written in the true Spirit of Chri&s;tianity and well worth the Con&s;idera|tion of Chri&s;tians.</Q></P>
<P>This engaging Character of <HI>Wm. Law</HI> brings to Mind the following Anecdote we have &s;omewhere met with. "The Earl of Peterborough, after a Vi&s;it paid by him to <HI>Fenelon,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of Cambray, &s;aid to Alexander Pope, Fenelon is a Man ca&s;t in a particular Mould which has not been u&s;ed for any Body el&s;e: He is a delicious Crea|ture! But I was forced to get from him as &s;oon as I po&s;|&s;ibly could; for el&s;e he would have made me <HI>pious.</HI>"</P>
<P>In his younger Years <HI>Law</HI> exhibited very con&s;picu|ou&s;ly, &s;ufficient Proofs of being learned in human Arts and Sciences; but he &s;oon embraced the Coun&s;el our Saviour gave the rich young Man and renounced the World wholly; and &s;olely followed CHRIST, in Meek|ne&s;s, Humility and Self-denial. In his latter Years he was looked upon as quite ab&s;orbed and throughly ani|mated with Love to GOD and Men; &s;o that the Powers of Life in him were nothing but heavenly Love and heavenly Flames.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="019755_0006_0FACAB49231FA748">A Writer, under the Signature of <HI>Chri&s;tophilus,</HI> in Lloyd's Evening Po&s;t in the Year 1772, &s;peaking of <HI>William Law</HI> and recommending his Writings, &s;ays, "Though I had no long Acquaintance with him, yet a few Months before his Decea&s;e, I was indulged with an ample and intimate Conver&s;ation with him upon the State of Religion in our Time and Nation, and on many other the mo&s;t intere&s;ting Subjects. This I regard as a Favour of GOD be&s;towed on me, and which I would not have been without on any Con&s;ideration. I only wi&s;h to make the very be&s;t U&s;e of it, in all Re&s;pects.&mdash; Mr. <HI>Law</HI> lived as he wrote and died as he lived. I am pretty credibly informed that amid&s;t the mo&s;t excru|ciated Pains of the Stone, and at the Age of Seventy five Years, immediately before his Di&s;&s;olution, ri&s;ing up in his Bed, he &s;aid,
<Q>Take away the&s;e filthy Garments; I feel a Fire of Love <HI>within,</HI> which has burnt up every Thing contrary to it&s;elf and transformed every Thing into its own Nature.</Q>
Oh! might every Mini&s;ter and each of their Flocks (of every Denomination) live the Life and die the Death of this truly righteous Man!"</P>
<P>"To give a &s;hort Specimen of the Conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed between us;
<Q>Sir, (&s;ays he) I am not fond of religious Go&s;&s;iping. My be&s;t Thoughts are in my Works, and to them I recommend you. If I &s;hould &s;eem to you a po&s;itive old Fellow, I cannot help it, well knowing the Ground from which I write: But, dear Sir, above all Things be pre&s;ent with, and attend carefully to, your own Heart; there you will be &s;ure to meet with all the Evil; and there only you can meet with God and all real Goodne&s;s.</Q>&mdash;Having already reaped Benefit by this Advice&punc; (through God's Mercy) I communicate it to the Public for the &s;ame End; it is needful; and may it prove, together with his other Writings, a Standard lifted up again&s;t that Inundation of infidel Profligacy
<PB N="viii" REF="019755_0007_0FACAB49A082C100">
and notional Faith; again&s;t the numberle&s;s Number of flagrant Sinners and hypocritical, fal&s;e Saints, which every where divide a fallen Chri&s;tendom."</P>
<P>"Upon my own Knowledge, &s;ays the worthy <HI>Hartley,</HI> Mr. Law was a Gentleman of free Conver&s;ation and often received Company at his Hou&s;e in King's Cliff."</P>
<P>He died April 9th 1761, Aged 75 Years, and the whole of the following Addre&s;s was &s;ent by him&s;elf to be printed, except a few Pages, the la&s;t of which was written by him not many Days before his Death, and though it appears chiefly directed to the Epi&s;copal Clergy, is of common Concern to all profe&s;&s;ed Mini|&s;ters of the Go&s;pel and Chri&s;tians in general.</P>

<HEAD>An Extract from a Letter written by the late WILLIAM LAW, to J*** R*****, of <HI>Northampton,</HI> in An&s;wer to one from the latter, wherein he intimated to W. L. a De&s;ire to pay him a VISIT, propo&s;ing thereby to receive <HI>In&s;truction</HI> from his Conver&s;ation on the SPIRITUAL LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>AS to your Intention of a Vi&s;it here I can &s;ay No|thing to encourage it, and though my Countenance would have no forbidding Airs put on by my&s;elf, yet as old Age has given me her own Complexion, I might per|haps bear the Blame of it.</P>
<P>But my chief Objection again&s;t a Vi&s;it of this Kind, is the Rea&s;on which you give for it, viz. For my in&s;tructive Conver&s;ation on the Spiritual Life.</P>
<P>An Appointment for religious Conver&s;ation has a tak|ing Sound, and pa&s;&s;eth for a Sign of great Progre&s;s in Goodne&s;s; but with Regard to my&s;elf &s;uch a Meeting would rather make me &s;ilent than a Speaker in it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e I hurt my&s;elf, and am only acting a Part if I &s;peak to Per&s;ons on &s;piritual Matters either &s;ooner or further than as the Spirit of God (which bloweth when and where it li&s;teth) would be re&s;i&s;ted in me if I held my Tongue.</P>
<P>Secondly, Becau&s;e it is deluding the Per&s;ons I &s;peak to, and helping them to be content with an imaginary fal&s;e Food, &s;hould I as a &s;piritual A&s;&s;i&s;tant &s;peak to them of any Thing but that which is their own Evil and their own Good: For true Edification ari&s;es only from &s;uch Knowledge, and not from devout Harangues on the &s;pi|ritual Life in general, though &s;et forth in the mo&s;t enliv|ened Words.</P>
<P>The Spiritual Life is Nothing el&s;e but the working of the Spirit of God within us, and therefore our own Si|lence mu&s;t be a great Part of our Preparation for it, and
<PB N="2" REF="019755_0009_0FACAB4B2073E838">
much &s;peaking or Delight in it will be often no &s;mall Hindrance of that Good which we can only have from hearing what the Spirit and Voice of God &s;peaketh with|in us.</P>
<P>This is not enough known by religious Per&s;ons; they rejoice in kindling a Fire of their own, and delight too much in hearing of their own Voice, and &s;o lo&s;e that inward Unction from above which can alone new create their Hearts.</P>
<P>To &s;peak with the Tongues of Men or Angels on re|ligious Matters, is a much le&s;s Thing than to know how to &s;tay the Mind upon God, and abide with him in the Clo&s;et of our Hearts, ob&s;erving, loving, adoring, and obeying his holy Power within us.</P>
<P>Rhetoric and fine Language about the Things of the Spirit is a vainer Babble than in other Matters; and he that thinks to grow in true Goodne&s;s by hearing or &s;peaking flaming Words or &s;triking Expre&s;&s;ions, as is now much the Way of the World, may have a great Deal of Talk, but will have but little of his Conver&s;ation in Heaven.</P>
<P>I have wrote very largely on the Spiritual Life, and he that has read and likes it, has of all Men the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to a&s;k me any Que&s;tions about, or vi&s;it me on that Occa&s;ion. He under&s;tands not my Writings, nor the End of them, who does not &s;ee that their whole Drift is to call all Chri&s;tians to a God and Chri&s;t within them, as the only po&s;&s;ible Life, Light, and Power of all Good|ne&s;s they can ever have; and therefore as much turn my Readers from my&s;elf, as from any other Lo here, or Lo there.&mdash;I invite all People to the Marriage of the Lamb, but no one to my&s;elf.</P>

<P>SHOULD the Peru&s;al of the foregoing Extract ex|cite in the Minds of any a De&s;ire to become acquainted with more of this Author's Sentiments re&s;pecting the im|portant Subject of Chri&s;tianity, they are referred to his Literary Works, which well de&s;erve the mo&s;t &s;erious and attentive Peru&s;al, being evidently the Fruits of an un|feigned Piety: They prove beyond the &s;malle&s;t Degree of Doubt, the In&s;ufficiency of the Human Rea&s;on unenlight|ened by Revelation to comprehend the My&s;teries of the Chri&s;tian Religion, which are only clearly under&s;tood by the Spiritually Di&s;cerning.</P>
<P>This Divinely-in&s;pired Writer hath wi&s;ely rejected, as vain and trifling with Re&s;pect to the great Cau&s;e of True Religion, all tho&s;e ab&s;tru&s;e Speculations which are merely human, and equally within the Reach of the virtuous and the vicious, as they too frequently &s;erve but to divert the Mind from the proper Object of its Contemplation. How very incon&s;iderable is that Knowledge which relates only to Things terre&s;trial, that Study which extends not be|yond the narrow Confines of Time, when compared to the Acqui&s;ition of True Wi&s;dom,
<Q>which maketh wi&s;e unto Salvation,</Q>
<Q>who&s;e Ways are Ways of Plea&s;ant|ne&s;s, and all who&s;e Paths are Peace.</Q>
Tho&s;e who re|ceive their In&s;tructions from the Source of Divine Know|ledge, and pur&s;ue that Mode of Conduct it points out to them, will a&s;&s;uredly experience
<Q>that Peace which the World can neither give nor take away,</Q>
and anticipate with Joy inexpre&s;&s;ible that awful Moment, that mo&s;t &s;o|lemn Sea&s;on when the immortal Soul &s;hall take its Flight to the unexplored Regions of Futurity.

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE CLERGY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Rea&s;on of my humbly and affectionately ad|dre&s;&s;ing this Di&s;cour&s;e to the Clergy, is not, be|cau&s;e it treats of Things not of common concern to all Chri&s;tians, but chiefly to invite and induce them, as far as I can, to the &s;erious Peru&s;al of it; and becau&s;e what|ever is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to Chri&s;tian Salvation, if either neglect|ed, overlooked, or mi&s;taken by them, is of the &s;adde&s;t Con&s;equence both to them&s;elves, and the Churches in which they mini&s;ter.&mdash;I &s;ay <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to Salvation, for I would not turn my own Thoughts, or call the Atten|tion of Chri&s;tians to any Thing, but the <HI>one Thing</HI> need|ful, the one Thing <HI>e&s;&s;ential,</HI> and only <HI>available,</HI> to our Ri&s;ing out of our fallen State, and becoming, as we were at our Creation, an holy Offspring of God, and real Partakers of the divine Nature.</P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked, What this one Thing is? It is the SPIRIT OF GOD brought again to his FIRST POWER OF LIFE IN US. Nothing el&s;e is wanted by us, nothing el&s;e intended for us, by the Law, the Prophets, and the Go&s;pel. Nothing el&s;e is, or can be effectual, to the making &s;inful man become again a godly Creature.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="019755_0012_0FACAB4D6ABFBDA8">Every thing el&s;e, be it what it will, however glorious and divine in outward Appearance, every Thing, that Angels, Men, <HI>Churches,</HI> or <HI>Reformations,</HI> can do for us, is dead and helple&s;s, but &s;o far as it is, the <HI>im|mediate Work</HI> of the Spirit of God, breathing, and liv|ing in it.</P>
<P>All Scripture bears full witne&s;s to this Truth, and the End and De&s;ign of all that is written, is only to call us back from the Spirit of Satan, the Fle&s;h, and the World, to be again under full Dependance upon, and Obedience to the Spirit of God, who out of <HI>free Love,</HI> and thir&s;t after our Souls, &s;eeks to have his <HI>fir&s;t Power</HI> of Life in us. When this is done, all is done, that the Scripture can do for us.&mdash;Read what Chapter, or Doctrine of Scripture you will, be ever &s;o delighted with it, it will leave you as poor, as empty, and unre|formed, as it found you, unle&s;s it be a Delight, that proceeds from, and has turned you <HI>wholly,</HI> and <HI>&s;olely</HI> to the Spirit of God, and &s;trengthened your Union with, and Dependance upon Him. For Love and De|light in matters of Scripture, whil&s;t it is only a Delight that is <HI>merely</HI> human, however Specious and Saint-like it may appear, is but the <HI>Self-love</HI> of &s;allen Adam, and can have no better a Nature, till it proceeds from the <HI>In&s;piration</HI> of God, quickening his <HI>own Life</HI> and Nature within us, which alone can have, or give forth a <HI>godly Love.</HI> For if it be an immutable Truth, that <HI>no man can call Je&s;us, Lord, but by the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> it mu&s;t be a Truth equally immutable, that no one can have any one <HI>Chri&s;t-like</HI> Temper, or Power of Goodne&s;s, but &s;o far, and in &s;uch Degree, as he is <HI>immediately</HI> led, and go|verned by the holy Spirit.</P>
<P>The Grounds and Rea&s;ons of which, are as follow.</P>
<P>All po&s;&s;ible Goodne&s;s, that either can be named, or is namele&s;s, was in God from all Eternity, and mu&s;t to all Eternity be <HI>in&s;eparable</HI> from him; it can be no where, but where God is. As therefore before God created any Thing, it was certainly true, that there was but <HI>one
<PB N="3" REF="019755_0013_0FACAB4E21E2FCE0">
that was good;</HI> &s;o it is ju&s;t the &s;ame Truth, after God has created innumerable Ho&s;ts of ble&s;&s;ed, holy, and heavenly Beings, that there is but <HI>one that is good,</HI> and that is God.</P>
<P>All that can be called Goodne&s;s, Holine&s;s, divine Tempers, heavenly Affections, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Creatures, are no more their own, or the Growth of their created Powers, than they were their own, before they were created. But all that is called divine Goodne&s;s and Virtue in the Creature, is nothing el&s;e, but the <HI>one</HI> Goodne&s;s of God manife&s;ting a <HI>Birth,</HI> and <HI>Di&s;covery</HI> of it&s;elf in the Creature, according as its created Nature is fitted to receive it. This is the unalterable State be|tween God and the Creature. Goodne&s;s, for ever and ever, can only belong to God, as <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to him, and <HI>in&s;eparable</HI> from him, as his own Unity.</P>
<P>God could not make the Creature to be great, and glorious <HI>in it&s;elf;</HI> this is as impo&s;&s;ible, as for God to create Beings into a State of <HI>Independance</HI> on him&s;elf. The Heavens, &s;aith David, <HI>declare the Glory of God;</HI> and no Creature, any more than the Heavens, can de|clare any other Glory, but that of God. And as well might it be &s;aid, <HI>that the Firmament &s;heweth forth</HI> its own <HI>Handy-Work,</HI> as that a holy, divine, or heavenly Creature, &s;heweth forth its own natural Power.</P>
<P>But now, if all that is divine, great, glorious, and happy, in the Spirits, Tempers, Operations, and Enjoy|ments of the Creature, is only &s;o much of the Great|ne&s;s, Glory, Maje&s;ty, and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of God, dwel|ling in it, and giving forth various Births of his own triune <HI>Life, Light,</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> in and through the ma|nifold Forms, and Capacities of the Creature to receive them, then we may infallibly &s;ee the true Ground and Nature of all true Religion; and <HI>when,</HI> and <HI>how,</HI> we may be &s;aid to fulfil all our Religious Duty to God. For the Creatures true Religion, is its rendering to God, all that is God's, it is its true continual Acknowledging all that which it is, and has, and enjoys, in and from
<PB N="4" REF="019755_0014_0FACAB4EE4B9D718">
God. This is the one true Religion of all intelligent Creatures, whether in Heaven, or on Earth; for as they all have but <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>&s;ame Relation</HI> to God, &s;o though ever &s;o different in their &s;everal Births, States or Of|fices, they all have but one and the &s;ame true Religion, or right Behaviour towards God. Now the <HI>one Relation,</HI> which is the Ground of all true Religion, and is one and the &s;ame between God, and all intelligent Crea|tures, is this, it is a <HI>total, unalterable Dependance upon God,</HI> an <HI>immediate, continual receiving of every Kind, and Degree of Goodne&s;s, Ble&s;&s;ing, and Happine&s;s, that ever was, or can be found in them, from God alone.</HI> The highe&s;t Angel has nothing of its <HI>own,</HI> that it can offer unto God, no more Light, Love, Purity, Perfection, and glorious Hallelujahs, that &s;pring from it&s;elf, or its own Powers, than the poore&s;t Creature upon Earth. Could the Angel &s;ee a <HI>Spark</HI> of Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s, or Excellence, as coming from, or belonging to <HI>its &s;elf,</HI> its Place in Heaven would be lo&s;t, as &s;ure as <HI>Lucifer</HI> lo&s;t his. But they are ever abiding Flames of Pure Love, always a&s;cending up to, and uniting with God, for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e the Wi&s;dom, the Power, the Glory, the Maje&s;ty, the Love, and Goodne&s;s of God <HI>alone,</HI> is all that they &s;ee, and feel, and know, either within, or without them&s;elves.&mdash;Songs of Prai&s;e to their hea|venly Father, are their ravi&s;hing Delight, becau&s;e they &s;ee, and know, and feel, that it is the <HI>Breath</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of their Heavenly Father that <HI>&s;ings</HI> and <HI>rejoices</HI> in them. &mdash;Their Adoration in Spirit and in Truth never cea&s;es, becau&s;e they never cea&s;e to acknowledge the ALL of God;&mdash;the ALL of God in them&s;elves, and the ALL of God in the whole Creation. This is the one Religi|on of Heaven, and nothing el&s;e is the Truth of Religi|on on Earth.</P>
<P>The Matter therefore plainly comes to this, Nothing can do, or be, the <HI>Good of Religion</HI> to the intelligent Creature, but the Power and Pre&s;ence of God, <HI>really</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> living and working in it. But if this be
<PB N="5" REF="019755_0015_0FACAB4FA94C4FB8">
the unchangeable Nature of that <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s,</HI> which is to be had from our Religion, then of all Nece&s;&s;ity, the Creature mu&s;t have all its <HI>Religious</HI> Good|ne&s;s, as wholely and &s;olely from God's <HI>immediate Opera|tion,</HI> as it had its fir&s;t Goodne&s;s at its Creation. And it is the &s;ame Impo&s;&s;ibility for the Creature to help it&s;elf to That, which is good, and ble&s;&s;ed in Religion, by any Contrivance, Rea&s;onings, or Workings of its own Na|tural Powers, as to create it&s;elf. For the Creature after its Creation, can no more take any Thing to it&s;elf, that belongs to God, than it could take it, before it was created. And if Truth forces us to hold, that the Na|tural Powers of the Creature could only come from the <HI>one Power</HI> of God, the &s;ame Truth &s;hould &s;urely more force us to confe&s;s, that <HI>That</HI> which <HI>comforts,</HI> that which <HI>enlightens,</HI> that which <HI>ble&s;&s;es,</HI> which gives Peace, Joy, Goodne&s;s, and re&s;t to its natural Powers, can be had in no other way, nor by any other Thing, but from God's immediate, holy Operation found in it.</P>
<P>Now the Rea&s;on, why no Work of Religion, but that which is begun, continued, and carried on by the <HI>Living Operation</HI> of God in the creature, can have any Truth, Goodne&s;s, or divine Ble&s;&s;ing in it, is becau&s;e, nothing can in Truth <HI>&s;eek</HI> God, but that which comes from God. Nothing can in Truth <HI>find</HI> God, as its Good, but that which has the Nature of God living in it; like can only rejoice in like; and therefore no reli|gious Service of the Creature, can have any Truth, Goodne&s;s, or Ble&s;&s;ing in it, but that which is done in the Creature, in, and through, and by a Principle and Power of the divine Nature begotten, and breathing forth in it all holy Tempers, Affections, and Adora|tions.</P>
<P>All true Religion is, or brings forth, an e&s;&s;ential Uni|on, and Communion of the Spirit of the Creature, with the Spirit of the Creator: God in it, and it in God, one Life, one Light, one Love. The Spirit of God fir&s;t gives, or &s;ows the <HI>Seed</HI> of divine Union in the
<PB N="6" REF="019755_0016_0FACAB506788D980">
Soul of every Man; and Religion is <HI>That,</HI> by which it is quickened, rai&s;ed, and brought forth to a Fullne&s;s, and growth of a Life in God,&mdash;Take a Similitude of this, as follows.&mdash;The Beginning, or <HI>Seed</HI> of animal <HI>Breath,</HI> mu&s;t fir&s;t be born in the Creature from the <HI>Spirit</HI> of this World, and then <HI>Re&s;piration,</HI> &s;o long as it la&s;ts, keeps up an <HI>e&s;&s;ential Union</HI> of the animal Life with the Breath, or Spirit of this World. In like manner, di|vine Faith, Hope, Love, and Re&s;ignation to God, are in the religious Life, its acts of <HI>Re&s;piration,</HI> which &s;o long as they are true, unite God and the Creature, in the &s;ame living, and e&s;&s;ential manner, as <HI>animal Re&s;pi|ration,</HI> unites the Breath of the Animal, with the Breath of this World.</P>
<P>Now as no Animal could <HI>begin</HI> to re&s;pire, or unite with the Breath of this World, but becau&s;e it has its Beginning to breathe, begotten in it from the Air of this World, &s;o it is equally certain, that no Creature, Angel or Man, could <HI>begin</HI> to be religious, or breathe forth the divine Affections of Faith, Love, and De&s;ire towards God, but becau&s;e a <HI>Living Seed</HI> of the&s;e divine Affections, was by the Spirit of God fir&s;t <HI>begotten</HI> in it. &mdash;And as a <HI>Tree,</HI> or <HI>Plant</HI> can only grow, and fruc|tify by the <HI>&s;ame Power,</HI> that fir&s;t give Birth to the Seed, &s;o Faith, and Hope, and Love towards God, can only grow, and fructify by the <HI>&s;ame Power,</HI> that begat the <HI>fir&s;t Seed</HI> of them in the Soul. Therefore divine, <HI>im|mediate In&s;piration,</HI> and divine Religion, are in&s;eperable in the Nature of the Thing.</P>
<P>Take away <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> or &s;uppo&s;e it to cea&s;e, and then no Religious acts, or Affections, can give forth any Thing, that is godly or divine. For the Creature can offer, or return Nothing to God, but <HI>That,</HI> which it has fir&s;t received from him; therefore, if it is to offer and &s;end up to God, Affections, and A&s;pirations, that are divine and godly, it mu&s;t of all nece&s;&s;ity have the divine and godly Nature living, and breathing in it.&mdash; Can any Thing reflect Light, before it has received it,
<PB N="7" REF="019755_0017_0FACAB512A98A5D8">
or any other Light, than that which it has received? Can any Creature breathe forth <HI>earthly,</HI> or <HI>diabolical</HI> Affections, before it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an <HI>earthly,</HI> or <HI>diabo|lical</HI> Nature? Yet this is as po&s;&s;ible, as for any Creature to have divine Affections ri&s;ing up, and dwelling in it, either <HI>before,</HI> or any <HI>farther,</HI> than as it has, or partakes of the divine Nature, dwelling, and operating in it.</P>
<P>A religious <HI>Faith, that</HI> is <HI>unin&s;pired,</HI> a <HI>Hope,</HI> or <HI>Love,</HI> that proceeds not from the immediate Working of the <HI>divine Nature</HI> within us, can no more do any divine Good to our Souls, or unite them with the Goodne&s;s of God, than an Hunger after earthly Food, can feed us with the immortal Bread of Heaven.&mdash;All that the <HI>natural,</HI> or <HI>unin&s;pired</HI> Man does, or can do in the Church, has no more of the Truth, or Power of divine Wor&s;hip in it, than that, which he does in the <HI>Field,</HI> or <HI>Shop,</HI> through a De&s;ire of Riches.&mdash;And the Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e all the Acts of the Natural Man, whether relating to Matters of Religion, or the World, mu&s;t be <HI>equally Selfi&s;h,</HI> and there is no Po&s;&s;ibility of their being otherwi&s;e. For Self-love, Self-e&s;teem, Self-&s;eek|ing, and Living <HI>wholly</HI> to Self, are as &s;trictly the <HI>Whole</HI> of all that is, or po&s;&s;ibly can be, in the <HI>Natural Man,</HI> as in the Natural <HI>Bea&s;t</HI>; the one can no more be better, or act above <HI>this Nature,</HI> than the other. Neither can any Creature be in a better, or higher State than this, till &s;omething <HI>Supernatural</HI> is found in it; and this Su|pernatural &s;omething, called in Scripture, the WORD, or SPIRIT, or INSPIRATION of God, is <HI>that alone,</HI> from which Man can have the fir&s;t Good Thought about God, or the lea&s;t Power of having more heavenly De|&s;ires in his Spirit, than he has in his Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>A Religion that is not wholly built upon this <HI>Su|pernatural Ground,</HI> but &s;olely &s;tands upon the Powers, Rea&s;onings, and Conclu&s;ions of the Natural, <HI>unin&s;pired</HI> Man, has not &s;o much as the Shadow of true Religion in it, but is a mere <HI>Nothing,</HI> in the &s;ame Sen&s;e, as an <HI>Idol</HI> is &s;aid to be <HI>Nothing,</HI> becau&s;e the Idol has <HI>nothing</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="019755_0018_0FACAB5247833F90">
of That in it, which is pretended by it. For the Work of Religion has no <HI>divine good</HI> in it, but as it brings forth, and keeps up e&s;&s;ential Union of the Spirit of Man, with the Spirit of God; which e&s;&s;ential Union cannot be made, but through Love on both Sides, nor by Love, but where the Love that works on both Sides, is of the <HI>&s;ame Nature.</HI></P>
<P>No Man therefore can reach God with his Love, or have Union with him by it, but he who is in&s;pired with that <HI>one &s;ame Spirit of Love,</HI> with which God loved him|&s;elf from all Eternity, and before there was any Crea|ture.&mdash;Infinite Ho&s;ts of new created Heavenly Beings, can begin no <HI>new Kind</HI> of Love of God, nor have the lea&s;t Power of beginning to Love him at all, but &s;o far as his <HI>own holy Spirit of Love,</HI> wherewith he hath from all Eternity loved Him&s;elf, is brought to Life in them. This Love that was then in God alone, can be the <HI>only Love</HI> in Creatures, that can draw them to God; they can have no Power of cleaving to Him, of willing that which He wills, or adoring the divine Nature, but by partaking of that <HI>eternal Spirit</HI> of Love; and therefore the continual, immediate In&s;piration, or Operation of the holy Spirit, is the one only po&s;&s;ible Ground of our con|tinually Loving God. And of this <HI>in&s;pired Love,</HI> and no other, it is, that St. <HI>John</HI> &s;aith, <HI>He that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God.</HI> Suppo&s;e it to be any other Love, brought forth by any other Thing, but the Spirit of God, breathing his own Love in us, and then it cannot be true, that he who dwells in <HI>&s;uch Love,</HI> dwelleth in God.</P>
<P>Divine In&s;piration was <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to man's fir&s;t created State. The Spirit of God, breathed into, or brought to Life in him, was that alone, which made him a holy Creature in the Image and Likene&s;s of God. To have no other Mover, to live under no other Guide or Lea|der, but the Spirit, was that, which con&s;tituted all the Holine&s;s, which the fir&s;t man could have from God. Had he not been thus at the fir&s;t, God in him and he
<PB N="9" REF="019755_0019_0FACAB52A127EE28">
in God, brought into the World as a true offspring, and real Birth of the holy Spirit, no Di&s;pen&s;ation of God to <HI>fallen</HI> man, would have directed him to the holy Spirit, or ever have made mention of his In&s;piration in Man. For fallen Man could be directed to Nothing, as his Good, but that which he had, and was his Good, before he fell. And had not the holy Spirit been his fir&s;t Life, in and by which he lived, no <HI>in&s;pired Prophets</HI> among&s;t the Sons of fallen Adam, had ever been heard of, or any <HI>holy men &s;peaking as they were moved by the holy Gho&s;t.</HI> For the Thing would have been impo&s;&s;ible, no fallen Man could have been <HI>in&s;pired</HI> by the holy Spi|rit, but becau&s;e the fir&s;t Life or Man was a true and real Birth of it; and al&s;o becau&s;e every fallen Man, had by the Mercy and free Grace of God, a <HI>&s;ecret Remains</HI> of his fir&s;t Life, pre&s;erved in him, though&punc;, hidden, or rather &s;wallowed up by Fle&s;h and Blood; which <HI>&s;ecret Remains,</HI> &s;ignified, and a&s;&s;ured to Adam, by the name of a <HI>Brui&s;er of the Serpent,</HI> or <HI>Seed of the woman,</HI> was his <HI>only capacity</HI> to be called, and quickened again into his fir&s;t Life, by new Breathings of the holy Spirit in Him.</P>
<P>Hence it plainly appears, that the Go&s;pel State, could not be God's <HI>la&s;t Di&s;pen&s;ation,</HI> or the fini&s;hing of Man's Redemption, unle&s;s its whole Work, was a Work of the Spirit of God in the Spirit of Man; that is, unle&s;s without all Vails, Types, and Shadows, it brought <HI>the Thing it&s;elf,</HI> or the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of all former Types, and Shadows, into <HI>real Enjoyment,</HI> &s;o as to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Man in <HI>Spirit,</HI> and in <HI>truth.</HI> Now the <HI>Thing it&s;elf,</HI> and for the Sake of which, all God's Di&s;pen&s;ations have been, is that <HI>fir&s;t Life of God, which was e&s;&s;entially born in the Soul of the fir&s;t Man,</HI> Adam, and to which he died. But now, if the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation comes at the End of all Types, and Shadows, to bring forth again in Man, a true and full Birth of that holy Spirit, which he had at fir&s;t, then it mu&s;t be plain, that the Work of this Di&s;pen&s;ation, mu&s;t be <HI>&s;olely,</HI> and <HI>immediately</HI> the Work
<PB N="10" REF="019755_0020_0FACAB536046A648">
of the holy Spirit. For if Man could no other po&s;&s;ible way, have had a holy Nature, and Spirit <HI>at fir&s;t,</HI> but as an Offspring, or Birth of the holy Spirit, at his Cre|ation, it is certain from the Nature of the Thing, that fallen Man, dead to his fir&s;t holy Nature, can have that &s;ame holy Nature again, no other way, but &s;olely by the Operation of that &s;ame holy Spirit, from the Breath of which, he had at fir&s;t, a holy Nature and Life in God. Therefore <HI>immediate</HI> In&s;piration is as nece&s;&s;ary to make fallen Man alive again unto God, as it was to make Man at fir&s;t, a Living Soul after the Image, and in the Likene&s;s of God. And <HI>Continual</HI> In&s;piration is as nece&s;&s;ary, as Man's Continuance in his redeemed State. For this is a certain Truth, that <HI>That</HI> alone, which begins, or gives Life, mu&s;t of all Nece&s;&s;ity be the only Continuance, or Pre&s;ervation of Life. The &s;econd Step can only be taken by <HI>That,</HI> which gave Power to take the fir&s;t.&mdash;No Life can continue in the Goodne&s;s of its fir&s;t created, or redeemed State, but by its continuing under the Influence of, and working with, and by that powerful Root, or Spirit, which at fir&s;t created, or redeemed it. Every Branch of the Tree, though ever &s;o richly brought forth, mu&s;t wither and dye, as &s;oon as it cea&s;es to have <HI>continual Union</HI> with, and Virtue from that Root, which fir&s;t brought it forth. And to this Truth, as ab&s;olutely grounded in the Nature of the Thing, our Lord appeals as a Proof, and full Illu&s;tration of the Nece&s;&s;ity of his <HI>immediate</HI> in|dwelling, Breathing, and Operating in the redeemed Soul of Man, &s;aying, <HI>I am the Vine, ye are the Branches,</HI> as the Branch <HI>cannot bear fruit of it&s;elf,</HI> no <HI>more can ye, except ye abide in me. He that abideth in me,</HI> and I <HI>in him, the &s;ome bringeth forth much Fruit. If a man abide not in me, he is ca&s;t forth as a withered</HI> Branch; for <HI>with|out me, ye can do&punc; Nothing.</HI> John xv.</P>
<P>Now from the&s;e Words, let this conclu&s;ion be here drawn, <HI>viz.</HI> That therefore, to turn to Chri&s;t as a <HI>Light within</HI> us, to expect Life from nothing but his <HI>holy
<PB N="11" REF="019755_0021_0FACAB54222224D8">
Birth</HI> rai&s;ed within us, to give our&s;elves up wholly and &s;olely to the <HI>immediate, continual</HI> Influx, and Operation of his holy Spirit, depending wholly upon it for every Kind, and Degree of Goodne&s;s and Holine&s;s, that we want, or can receive, is, and can be Nothing el&s;e, but <HI>proud, rank</HI> Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>Now as infinitely ab&s;urd as this conclu&s;ion is, no one that condemns <HI>continual, immediate In&s;piration,</HI> as gro&s;s Enthu&s;ia&s;m, can po&s;&s;ibly do it with le&s;s ab&s;urdity, or &s;hew him&s;elf a wi&s;er Man, or better Rea&s;oner, than he that concludes, that becau&s;e, <HI>without Chri&s;t we can do Nothing,</HI> therefore we ought not to believe, expect, wait for, and depend upon his continual, immediate operation in every Thing that we do, or would do well. &mdash;As to the <HI>Pride</HI> charged upon this pretended En|thu&s;ia&s;m, it is the &s;ame ab&s;urdity. Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>without me ye can do Nothing,</HI> the &s;ame as if he had &s;aid, As to your&s;elves, and all that can be called your own, ye are mere <HI>helple&s;s Sin and Mi&s;ery,</HI> and Nothing that is good, can come from you, but as it is done by the <HI>con|tinual, immediate</HI> Breathing and In&s;piration or another Spirit, given by God, to over-rule <HI>your own,</HI> to &s;ave and deliver you from all your own Goodne&s;s, your own Wi&s;dom, and Learning, which always were, and always will be, as corrupt and impure, as earthly and &s;en&s;ual, as your own Fle&s;h and Blood. Now is there any <HI>&s;elfi&s;h,</HI> creaturely Pride, in fully believing this to be true, and in acting in full Conformity to it? If &s;o, then he that confe&s;&s;es, he neither hath, nor ever can have a &s;ingle Farthing, but as it is freely given him from Charity, thereby declares him&s;elf to be a Pur&s;e-proud, vain Boa&s;t|er of his own Wealth. Such is the &s;piritual Pride of Him, who fully acknowleges, that he neither hath, nor can have the lea&s;t Spark, or breathing after Goodne&s;s, but what is freely kindled, or breathed into him by the Spirit of God. Again, if it is <HI>&s;piritual Pride,</HI> to believe, that Nothing that we ever think, or &s;ay, or do, either in the Church, or our Clo&s;ets, can have any truth
<PB N="12" REF="019755_0022_0FACAB54E0160510">
of goodne&s;s in it, but that which is wrought &s;olely and immediately by the Spirit of God in us, then it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that in order to have <HI>religious Humility,</HI> we mu&s;t never forget to take &s;ome Share of our religious Virtues to our&s;elves, and not allow (as Chri&s;t hath &s;aid) that <HI>without Him, we can do Nothing</HI> that is good. It mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;aid, that St. Paul took too much upon him, when he &s;aid, <HI>the Life that I now live, is not mine, but Chri&s;t's that liveth in me.</HI></P>
<P>Behold a Pride, and an Humility, the one as good as the other, and both logically de&s;cended from a Wi&s;|dom, that confe&s;&s;es it cometh not from above.</P>
<P>The Nece&s;&s;ity of a Continual In&s;piration of the Spirit of God, both to begin the fir&s;t, and continue every &s;tep of a divine Life in Man, is a Truth, to which every Life in Nature, as well as all Scripture, bears full Wit|ne&s;s.&mdash;A <HI>natural</HI> Life, a <HI>bea&s;tial</HI> Life, a <HI>diabolical</HI> Life, can &s;ub&s;i&s;t no longer, than whil&s;t they are imme|diately and continually under the working Power of that Root, or Source, from which they Sprung. Thus it is with the <HI>divine</HI> Life in Man, it can never be in him, but as a Growth of Life in, and from God.&mdash;Hence it is, that <HI>Re&s;i&s;ting</HI> the Spirit, <HI>Quenching</HI> the Spirit, <HI>Griev|ing</HI> the Spirit, is that alone, which gives Birth and Growth to every Evil that reigns in the World, and leaves Men, and Churches, not only an ea&s;y, but a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> Prey to the Devil, the World, and the Fle&s;h. And Nothing but <HI>Obedience</HI> to the Spirit, <HI>tru&s;ting</HI> to the Spirit, <HI>walking</HI> in the Spirit, <HI>praying</HI> with and for its continual In&s;piration, can po&s;&s;ibly keep either Men, or Churches, from being Sinners, or Idolaters, in all that they do. For every Thing in the Life, or Religion of Man, that has not the Spirit of God, for its <HI>Mover, Director,</HI> and <HI>End,</HI> be it what it will, is but earthly, &s;en&s;ual, or devili&s;h.&mdash;The Truth and Perfection of the Go&s;pel State, could not &s;hew it&s;elf, till it became &s;olely a <HI>Mini&s;tration of the Spirit,</HI> or a Kingdom in which the holy Spirit of God, had the doing of all that was
<PB N="13" REF="019755_0023_0FACAB559FBFEE00">
done in it.&mdash;The Apo&s;tles, whil&s;t Chri&s;t was with them in the Fle&s;h, were in&s;tructed in heavenly Truths from his Mouth, and enabled to work Miracles in his Name, yet not qualified to know, and teach the <HI>My&s;te|ries</HI> of his Kingdom. After his Re&s;urrection, He con|ver&s;ed with them forty Days, &s;peaking to them of Things appertaining to the Kingdom of God; nay though he breathed on them, and &s;aid, <HI>receive ye the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. yet this al&s;o would not do, they were &s;till unable to preach, or bear Witne&s;s to the <HI>Truth, as it is in Je&s;us.</HI> And the Rea&s;on is, there was &s;till a <HI>higher Di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> to come, which &s;tood in &s;uch an <HI>opening</HI> of the divine Life in their Hearts, as could not be effected from an outward In&s;truction of Chri&s;t him|&s;elf. For though He had &s;ufficiently told his Di&s;ciples, the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of being born again of the Spirit, yet he le&s;t them <HI>unborn</HI> of it, till He came again in the Power of the Spirit. He breathed on them, and &s;aid <HI>receive ye the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> yet that which was <HI>&s;aid</HI> and <HI>done,</HI> was not the <HI>Thing it&s;elf,</HI> but only a <HI>Type</HI> or <HI>outward Sig|nification,</HI> of what they &s;hould receive, when He, being <HI>glorified,</HI> &s;hould come again in the Fulne&s;s, and Power of the Spirit, breaking open the Deadne&s;s, and Dark|ne&s;s of their Hearts, with Light and Life from Heaven, which Light did, and alone could, open, and verify in their Souls, all that he had &s;aid, and promi&s;ed to them, whil&s;t he was with them in the Fle&s;h.&mdash;All this is expre&s;sly declared by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, &s;aying unto them, <HI>I tell you the Truth, it is expedient for you that I go away;</HI> therefore Chri&s;t taught them, to believe the <HI>Want,</HI> and joyfully to expect the <HI>Coming</HI> of a <HI>higher,</HI> and more <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> State, than that of his bodily Pre&s;ence with them. For he adds, if <HI>I go not away,</HI> the <HI>Comfor|ter will not come</HI>; therefore the Comfort and Ble&s;&s;ing of Chri&s;t to his Followers, could not be had, till <HI>&s;omething more</HI> was done to them, and they were brought into a <HI>higher State,</HI> than they could be, by his verbal In&s;truc|tion of them. <HI>But if I go away,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I will &s;end

<P>Now when Chri&s;t had told them of the Nece&s;&s;ity of an higher State, than that they were in, and the Nece&s;|&s;ity of &s;uch a comforting, illuminating Guide, as they could not have, till his <HI>outward Teaching</HI> in human Lan|guage, was changed into the <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> and <HI>Operation</HI> of his Spirit in their Souls; He commands them, not to begin to bear Witne&s;s of him to the World, from what they did, and could in an <HI>human Way</HI> know of him, his Birth, his Life, Doctrines, Death, Sufferings, Re&s;urrection, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but to tarry at Jeru&s;alem, <HI>till they were endued with Power from on high;</HI> &s;aying unto them, <HI>Ye &s;hall receive Power, after that the Holy Gho&s;t is come upon you.

<P>Here are two mo&s;t important and fundamental Truths fully demon&s;trated, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that the Truth and Perfection of the Go&s;pel State, could not take Place, till Chri&s;t <HI>was glorified,</HI> and his Kingdom among&s;t Men, made wholly and &s;olely, a <HI>continual, immediate Mini&s;tration of the Spirit:</HI> Every Thing <HI>before</HI> this, was but &s;ub&s;ervient for a Time, and preparatory to <HI>this la&s;t</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, which could not have been the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> had it not carried Man above <HI>Types, Figures,</HI> and Shadows, into the <HI>real Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of that, which is the Spirit, and Truth of a divine Life.

<P><PB N="15" REF="019755_0025_0FACAB5738F7B5B0"><HI>Secondly,</HI> That as not the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> &s;o no man from their Time to the End of the World, can have any <HI>true</HI> and <HI>real</HI> Knowledge of the Spiritual Ble&s;&s;ings of Chri&s;t's Redemption, or have a <HI>divine call, Capacity,</HI> or <HI>Fitne&s;s,</HI> to preach, and bear Witne&s;s of them to the World, but &s;olely by that <HI>Same divine</HI> Spirit, opening all the My&s;te|ries of a <HI>Redeeming Chri&s;t</HI> in their inward Parts, as it did in the Apo&s;tles, Evangeli&s;ts, and fir&s;t Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>For why could not the Apo&s;tles, who had been Eye-Witne&s;&s;e&s;s to all the whole Proce&s;s of Chri&s;t, why could they not with their human Apprehen&s;ion, declare and te&s;tify the Truth of &s;uch Things, till they <HI>were baptized with Fire, and born again</HI> of <HI>the Spirit?</HI> It is becau&s;e the Truth of &s;uch Things, or the My&s;teries of Chri&s;t's Proce&s;s, as <HI>knowable</HI> by man, are Nothing el&s;e in them|&s;elves, but <HI>tho&s;e very Things,</HI> which are done by this heavenly <HI>Fire,</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of God in our Souls. There|fore to know the My&s;teries of Chri&s;t's Redemption, and to know the <HI>redeeming Work</HI> of God in our own Souls, is the &s;ame Thing; the one cannot be <HI>before,</HI> or <HI>without</HI> the other. Therefore every Man, be he who he will, however able in all Kinds of human literature, mu&s;t be an entire Stranger to all the My&s;teries of Go&s;|pel Redemption, and can only talk about them, as of any other <HI>Tale, he has been told,</HI> till they are brought forth, verified, fulfilled, and witne&s;&s;ed to, <HI>by that,</HI> which is found, felt, and enjoyed, of the <HI>whole Proce&s;s</HI> of Chri&s;t in his Soul.

It mu&s;t al&s;o be equally true, that the redeemed State of the Soul, being in it&s;elf, Nothing el&s;e but the Re&s;urrection of a divine and holy Life in it, mu&s;t as nece&s;&s;arily from fir&s;t to la&s;t, be the <HI>&s;ole Work</HI> of the Breathing, creating Spirit of God, as the fir&s;t, holy created State of the Soul was.&mdash;And all this, becau&s;e the My&s;teries of Chri&s;t's redeeming Power, which work, and bring forth the renewed State of the Soul, are not creaturely, finite, outward Things, that may be found, and enjoyed by verbal De&s;criptions, or formed Ideas of them, but are a <HI>Birth,</HI> and <HI>Life,</HI> and <HI>&s;piritual Operation,</HI> which as &s;olely belongs to God alone, as his creating Power.

And of every <HI>Tendency</HI> towards Goodne&s;s, be it ever &s;o &s;mall, that &s;ame may be truly affirmed of it, which St. Paul af|firmed of his highe&s;t State, <HI>yet not I, but Chri&s;t that liveth in me.</HI></P>
<P>But if the Belief of the nece&s;&s;ity, and certainty of immediate, continual, divine In&s;piration, in and for every thing, that can be holy and good in us, be (as its Ac|cu&s;ers &s;ay) <HI>rank Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> then he is the only &s;ober, orthodox Chri&s;tian, who of many a good Thought, and Action, that proceeds from him, frankly &s;aith, in order to avoid Enthu&s;ia&s;m, <HI>my own Power,</HI> and not Chri&s;t's Spirit living and breathing in me, <HI>hath done</HI> this for me.

Divines</HI> have found it out, as Dr. <HI>Warburton</HI> has done, who though denying <HI>immediate, continual</HI> In&s;piration, yet allows, that the Spirit's "ordinary Influence, occa|&s;ionally a&s;&s;i&s;ts the faithful." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Serm. Vol. I.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now this <HI>middle Way,</HI> hath neither Scripture, nor Sen&s;e in it; for an <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> Influence, or Concurrence, is as ab&s;urd, as an <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> God, and nece&s;&s;arily &s;up|po&s;es &s;uch a God. For an occa&s;ional <HI>Influence</HI> of the Spirit upon us, &s;uppo&s;es an occa&s;ional <HI>Ab&s;ence</HI> of the Spirit from us. For there could be no &s;uch Thing, un|le&s;s God was &s;ometimes with us, and &s;ometimes not, &s;ometimes doing us good, as the inward God of our Life, and &s;ometimes doing us no good at all, but leav|ing us to be good from our &s;elves.&mdash;Occa&s;ional Influ|ence nece&s;&s;arily implies all this bla&s;phemous Ab&s;urdity. Again, this <HI>middle Way</HI> of an <HI>occa&s;ional Influence</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI> nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es, that there is &s;omething of <HI>Man's own</HI> that is good, or the Holy Spirit of God, neither would, nor could a&s;&s;i&s;t, or co-operate with it. But if there was any Thing good in Man, for God to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and co-operate with, be&s;ides the <HI>SEED</HI> of his own divine Nature, or his own WORD of Life, &s;triv|ing to brui&s;e the Serpent's Nature within us, it could not be true, that there is only <HI>one that is good, and that is God.</HI> And was there any Goodne&s;s in Creatures, either in Heaven, or on Earth, but the <HI>one Goodne&s;s</HI> of the divine Nature, living, working, and manife&s;ting it|&s;elf in them, as its created In&s;truments, then good Crea|tures, both in Heaven and on Earth, would have &s;ome|thing el&s;e to adore, <HI>be&s;ides,</HI> or <HI>along</HI> with God. For Goodne&s;s, be it where it will, is adorable for it&s;elf, and becau&s;e it is Goodne&s;s; if therefore any Degree of it, belonged to the Creature, it ought to have a &s;hare of that &s;ame Adoration, that is paid to the Creator.&mdash; Therefore, if to believe, that Nothing godly can be alive in us, but what has <HI>all its</HI> Life, from the Spirit of God, living and breathing in us; if to look <HI>&s;olely</HI> to it,
<PB N="18" REF="019755_0028_0FACAB596189B180">
and depend <HI>wholly</HI> upon it, both for the <HI>Beginning,</HI> and <HI>Growth</HI> of every Thought, and De&s;ire, that can be holy and good in us, be <HI>proud, rank Enthu&s;ia&s;m;</HI> then it mu&s;t be the &s;ame Enthu&s;ia&s;m, to own but <HI>one</HI> God. For He that owns more Goodne&s;s than one, owns more Gods than one. And he that believes he can have any good in him, but the <HI>one</HI> Goodne&s;s of God, manife&s;ting it&s;elf in him, and through him, owns more Goodne&s;s, than one. But if it be true, that God and Goodne&s;s cannot be divided, then it mu&s;t be a Truth for ever and ever, that &s;o much of <HI>Good,</HI> &s;o much of <HI>God,</HI> mu&s;t be in the Creature.</P>
<P>And here lies the true, unchangeable Di&s;tinction between God, and <HI>Nature,</HI> and the <HI>natural Creature.</HI> Nature and Creature are only for the <HI>outward Mani|fe&s;tation</HI> of the inward, invi&s;ible, unapproachable Pow|ers of God; they can ri&s;e no higher, nor be any Thing el&s;e in them&s;elves, but as Temples, Habitations, or In|&s;truments, in which the <HI>&s;upernatural</HI> God, can, and does manife&s;t him&s;elf in various Degrees; bringing forth Creatures to be good with <HI>his own Goodne&s;s,</HI> to love and adore him with his <HI>own</HI> Spirit of Love, for ever &s;inging Prai&s;es to the <HI>divine</HI> Nature, by <HI>that</HI> which they <HI>partake</HI> of it. This is the Religion of <HI>divine In|&s;piration,</HI> which being interpreted, is <HI>Immanuel,</HI> or God <HI>within us.</HI> Every Thing &s;hort of this, is &s;hort of that Religion, which wor&s;hips God in Spirit, and in Truth.

I believe it may be taken for a certain Truth, that every Society of Chri&s;tians, who&s;e Religion &s;tands upon this Ground, however ardent, laborious, and good their Zeal may &s;eem to be in &s;uch Matters, yet in &s;pite of all, &s;ooner or later, it will be found, that <HI>Nature</HI> is at the Bottom, and that a &s;elfi&s;h, earthly, overbearing Pride in their own Difinitions, and Doctrines of Words, will by Degrees creep up to the &s;ame Height, and become that &s;ame fle&s;hly Wi&s;dom, doing tho&s;e very &s;ame Things, which they exclaim again&s;t in Popes, Cardinals, and Je&s;uits.

<P>This mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e of all fallen Chri&s;tendom, as well Popi&s;h, as Prote&s;tant, till &s;ingle Men, and Church|es, know, confe&s;s, and firmly adhere to this one Scrip|ture Truth, <HI>that our Salvation is in the Life of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in us.</HI> And that, becau&s;e this alone, was the di|vine Perfection of Man, before he fell, and will be his Perfection, when he is one with Chri&s;t in Heaven.&mdash; Every Thing be&s;ides this, or that is not &s;olely aiming at, and e&s;&s;entially leading to it, is but mere Babel in all Sects, and Divi&s;ions of Chri&s;tians, living to them&s;elves, and their <HI>own old Man,</HI> under a <HI>&s;eeming Holine&s;s</HI> of Chri&s;|tian Strife, and Contention about Scripture Words.&mdash; But this Truth of Truths, fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and firmly adhered to, brings God and Man together, puts an End to every <HI>Lo here,</HI> and <HI>Lo there,</HI> and turns the whole

For there is no po&s;&s;ibility of being <HI>like-minded</HI> with Chri&s;t, in any Thing that he taught, or having the Truth of one Chri&s;tian Virtue, but by the Nature and Spirit of Chri&s;t, become <HI>e&s;&s;entially living</HI> in us.

<P>But to return now to the Doctrine of continual In|&s;piration.

<P>Now whence was it, that a Religion, &s;o &s;erious in its Re&s;traints, &s;o beautiful in its outward Form, and Prac|tices, and commanding &s;uch Reverence from all that beheld it, was yet charged by Truth it&s;elf, with having <HI>inwardly</HI> &s;uch an abominable Nature?

<P>And yet, &s;ad and Satanical as <HI>this Self</HI> is, what is &s;o much cheri&s;hed and nouri&s;hed with our daily Love, Fears and Cares about it? How much worldly Wi&s;dom, how much laborious Learning, how many Subtleties of Con|trivance, and how many flattering Applications and Submi&s;&s;ions are made to the World, that this <HI>apo&s;tate Self,</HI> may have it's Fulne&s;s, both of inward Joys, and outward Glory?</P>
<P>But to all this, it mu&s;t yet be added, that a <HI>Religion of Self,</HI> of worldly Glory and Pro&s;perity carried on,

But Man, not ruled and governed by the Spirit, hath only the Nature of <HI>corrupt Fle&s;h,</HI> is under the full Power, and Guidance of fallen Nature, and is that very <HI>natural Man, to whom the Things of God are Fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI> But Man boldly <HI>rejecting,</HI> and <HI>preaching</HI> again&s;t a con|tinual, immediate divine, In&s;piration, is an Anti-Apo&s;tle, he layeth another Foundation, than that which Chri&s;t hath laid, he teacheth, that Chri&s;t needeth not, mu&s;t not, be <HI>all</HI> in <HI>all</HI> in <HI>us,</HI> and is a Preacher up of the Folly of fearing to <HI>grieve, quench,</HI> and <HI>re&s;i&s;t</HI> the Holy Spirit.&mdash;For <HI>when,</HI> or <HI>where,</HI> or <HI>how</HI> could every one of us, be in Danger of grieving, quenching, or re&s;i&s;t|ing the Spirit, unle&s;s his holy Breathings, and In&s;pira|tions were <HI>always</HI> within us? Or how could the <HI>Sin</HI> again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, have a more <HI>dreadful Nature,</HI> than that again&s;t the Father and the Son, but becau&s;e
<PB N="24" REF="019755_0034_0FACAB5DE0430880">
the <HI>continual, immediate</HI> Guidance and Operation of the Spirit, is the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> and <HI>highe&s;t</HI> Manife&s;tation of God in the fallen Soul of Man? It is not becau&s;e the Holy Gho&s;t is more worthy, or higher in Nature, than the Father, and the Son, but becau&s;e Father and Son, come forth in their <HI>own highe&s;t Power</HI> of redeeming Love, through the Covenant of a continual, immediate In&s;piration of the Spirit&punc; to be always dwelling, and working in the Soul. Many weak Things have been conjectured, and publi&s;hed to the World, about the <HI>Sin</HI> again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t; whereas the whole Nature of it lies in this, that it is a &s;inning, or &s;tanding out again&s;t the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> and <HI>highe&s;t</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation of God, for the full Redemption of Man. Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>If I had not come, they had not had Sin,</HI> that is, they had not had &s;uch a Weight of Guilt upon them; therefore the &s;inning again&s;t Chri&s;t <HI>come into the Fle&s;h,</HI> was of a more <HI>unpardonable</HI> Nature, than &s;inning again&s;t the Father under <HI>the Law.</HI> So likewi&s;e &s;inning again&s;t the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> is of a more unpardonable Nature, than &s;inning again&s;t the Father under the <HI>Law,</HI> or again&s;t the Son as <HI>come in the Fe&s;h,</HI> becau&s;e the&s;e two preced|ing Di&s;pen&s;ations, were but preparatory to the <HI>coming,</HI> or full Mini&s;tration of the Spirit. But when Father and Son were come, in the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Manife&s;tation</HI> of the Spirit, then he that refu&s;eth, or re&s;i&s;teth <HI>this Mini&s;tra|tion</HI> of the Spirit, re&s;i&s;teth <HI>all</HI> that the holy Three can do, to re&s;tore, and revive the fir&s;t Life of God in the Soul, and &s;o commits the <HI>unpardonable</HI> Sin; and which is therefore unpardonable, becau&s;e there remains no <HI>farther,</HI> or <HI>higher</HI> Power to remove it out of the Soul. For no Sin is pardonable, becau&s;e of its <HI>own Nature,</HI> or that which it is in it&s;elf, but becau&s;e there is <HI>&s;ome|thing</HI> yet to come, that can remove it out of the Soul; nor can any Sin be <HI>unpardonable,</HI> but becau&s;e it has with&s;tood, or turned from that, which was the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> and <HI>highe&s;t</HI> Remedy for the Removal of it.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that grieving, quenching, or re&s;i&s;ting the Spirit, is the <HI>Sin of all Sins,</HI> that mo&s;t of all &s;tops
<PB N="25" REF="019755_0035_0FACAB5E9F9AC648">
the Work of Redemption, and in the highe&s;t Degree &s;eparates Man from all Union with God. But there could be no &s;uch Sin, but becau&s;e the Holy Spirit is <HI>always</HI> breathing, willing, and working within us. For what Spirit can be <HI>grieved</HI> by us, but that which hath its <HI>will</HI> within us <HI>di&s;obeyed?</HI> What Spirit can be <HI>quenched</HI> by us, but that which is, and ever would be, a <HI>holy Fire</HI> of Life <HI>within</HI> us? What Spirit can be re|&s;i&s;ted by us, but that which is, and has its <HI>Working</HI> within us? A Spirit on the <HI>out&s;ide</HI> of us, cannot be the Spirit of God, nor could &s;uch a Spirit be any more quenched, or hindered by our Spirit, than a Man by Indignation at a Storm, could &s;top its Rage. Now, dreadful as the abovementioned Sin is, I would a&s;k all the <HI>Writers</HI> again&s;t <HI>continual, immediate,</HI> divine In&s;pira|tion, how they could more effectually lead Men, into an <HI>habitual</HI> State of <HI>&s;inning</HI> again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, than by &s;uch Doctrine? For how can we po&s;&s;ibly <HI>avoid</HI> the Sin of grieving, quenching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Spirit, but by continually reverencing his holy Pre&s;ence in us; by continually waiting for, tru&s;ting, and &s;olely attending to that, which the Spirit of God, <HI>wills, works,</HI> and <HI>manife&s;ts</HI> within us? To turn Men from this continual Dependance upon the Holy Spirit, is turning them from all true Knowledge of God. For without this, there is no Po&s;&s;ibility of any edifying, &s;aving Knowledge of God. For though we have ever &s;o many mathematical De|mon&s;trations or vi&s;ible Proofs of his <HI>Being,</HI> &amp;c. we are without all real Knowledge of Him, till his own quicke|ning Spirit within us, manife&s;ts Him, as a <HI>Power</HI> of Life, Light, Love, and Goodne&s;s, <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> found, vi|tally felt, and adored in our Souls. This is the one Knowledge of God, which <HI>is eternal Life,</HI> becau&s;e it is the Life of God manife&s;ted in the Soul, that Knowledge of which Chri&s;t &s;aith, No one <HI>knoweth the Father but the Son,</HI> and <HI>He</HI> to <HI>whom&s;oever the Son revealeth him.</HI> Therefore this Knowledge is only po&s;&s;ible to be found in him, who is in Chri&s;t <HI>a new Creature,</HI> for &s;o it is, that
<PB N="26" REF="019755_0036_0FACAB5FAE046540">
Chri&s;t revealeth the Father. But if none belong to God, but tho&s;e who are <HI>led by the Spirit of God,</HI> if we are Reprobates unle&s;s the Spirit of Chri&s;t be living in us, who need be told, that all that we have to tru&s;t to, or depend upon, as Children of God and Chri&s;t, is the <HI>continual, immediate Guidance, Unction,</HI> and <HI>Teaching of his Holy Spirit within us?</HI> Or how can we more <HI>profanely</HI> &s;in again&s;t this Spirit, and Power of God within us, or more expre&s;sly call Men from the Power of God unto Satan, than by ridiculing a Faith and Hope, that look <HI>wholly</HI> and <HI>&s;olely</HI> to his continual, immediate Breath|ings, and Operations, for all that can be holy and good in us?</P>
<P><HI>When I am lifted up from the Earth,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>I will draw all Men unto me.</HI> Therefore the <HI>one great Power</HI> of Chri&s;t in, and over the Souls of Men, is <HI>after</HI> he is in Heaven; then begins the true, full Power of his Drawing, becau&s;e it is by his Spirit in Man that he draws. But who can more re&s;i&s;t <HI>this Drawing,</HI> or de|feat its Operation in us, than he that preaches again&s;t, and condemns the Belief of a continual and immediate In&s;piration of the Spirit, when Chri&s;t's <HI>Drawing</HI> can be in nothing el&s;e, nor be powerful any other Way?</P>
<P>Now that which we are here taught, is the whole End of all Scripture; for all that is there &s;aid, however learnedly read, or &s;tudied by <HI>Hebrew,</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> Skill, fails of its only End, till it leads and brings us to an <HI>e&s;&s;ential God within us,</HI> to feel, and find all that which the Scriptures &s;peak of God, of Man, of Life and Death, of Good and Evil, of Heaven and Hell, as <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> ve|rified in our own Souls. For all is within Man, that can be either Good or Evil to him: God <HI>within him,</HI> is his divine Life, his divine Light, and his divine Love; Satan <HI>within him</HI> is his Life of <HI>Self,</HI> of <HI>earthly Wi&s;dom,</HI> of diabolical Fal&s;ene&s;s, Wrath, Pride, and Vanity of every Kind. There is no middle way between the&s;e two; He that is not under the Power of the one, is under the Power of the other. And the Rea&s;on is,

All which I thus make out in the following Manner.</P>
<Q><P>Man, con&s;idered as a Member of this World, who is to have his Share of the <HI>Good</HI> that is in it, is a <HI>&s;en&s;ible,</HI> and a <HI>rational</HI> Creature, that is, he has a certain Number of Sen&s;es, as Seeing, Hearing, Ta&s;t|ing, Touching, and Smelling, by which he is &s;en|&s;ible of that, which the outward World, in which he is placed, can do for him, or communicate to him, and &s;o is &s;en&s;ible of what Kind, and Degree of Hap|pine&s;s, he can have from it.</P>
<P>Now be&s;ides the&s;e Organs of Sen&s;e, he has a Pow|er, or Faculty of <HI>Rea&s;oning</HI> upon the Ideas, which he has received from the&s;e Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>Now how is it, that the <HI>good</HI> Things of this World are communicated to Man? How is he put in Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of them? To what Part of him are they pro|po&s;ed? Are his <HI>Sen&s;es,</HI> or his <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> the Means of his having &s;o much as he has, or can have from this World?</P>
<P>Now here, you mu&s;t degrade <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> ju&s;t as much, as it is degraded by Religion, and are obliged to &s;et it as low, with re&s;pect to the Things of this World, as it is &s;et with re&s;pect to the Things of the &s;piritual World. It is no more the Means of Communicat|ing the good Things of the one, than of the other. And as St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, <HI>the natural Man cannot receive the Things of the Spirit of God,</HI> for this Rea&s;on, <HI>be|cau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned;</HI> &s;o you mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity &s;ay, the <HI>rational Man</HI> cannot receive the Things of this World, for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e they are <HI>&s;en&s;ibly</HI> received, that is, by the Organs of Sen&s;e. Rea&s;on therefore has no higher Office, or Power in the Things of this World, than in the Things of Religion; and Religion does no more Violence to your Rea&s;on, or rejects it any other Way, than all
<PB N="41" REF="019755_0051_0FACAD3987F37620">
the good Things of this World reject it: It is not <HI>&s;eeing,</HI> it is not <HI>hearing, ta&s;ting,</HI> or <HI>feeling</HI> the Things of this Life; it can &s;upply the Place of no one of the&s;e Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>Now it is only thus <HI>helple&s;s,</HI> and <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> in Religi|on; it is neither &s;eeing, nor hearing, ta&s;ting, nor feeling of &s;piritual Things; therefore in the Things of Religion, and in the Things of this World, it has one, and the &s;ame <HI>In&s;ignificancy.</HI>&mdash;It is the <HI>Sen|&s;ibility</HI> of the Soul, that mu&s;t receive what this World can communicate to it; it is the <HI>Sen&s;ibility</HI> of the Soul, that mu&s;t receive what God can communicate: Rea|&s;on may follow after in either Ca&s;e, and view through its own Gla&s;s what is done, but it can do no more. Rea&s;on may be here of the &s;ame Service to us, as when we want any of the Enjoyments of this Life; it may direct us how, and where they are to be had; it may take away a Cover from our Eyes, or open our Window-&s;hutters, when we want the Light; but it can do no more towards <HI>&s;eeing,</HI> than to make way for the Light to act upon our Eyes. This is all its Office and Ability in the Things of Religion; it may remove that, which hinders the <HI>Sen&s;ibility</HI> of the Soul, or prevents the divine Light's acting upon it, but it can do no more: Becau&s;e the Faculty of Rea|&s;oning, is only the Activity of the Mind upon its own Ideas or Images, which the Sen&s;es have cau&s;ed it to form from that, which has been &s;tirred up in them; but has Nothing of the Nature of that which it &s;pe|culates upon by Ideas: It does not become dark, when it rea&s;ons upon the Cau&s;e, or Nature of Dark|ne&s;s, nor becomes Light, when it rea&s;ons about it; neither is it Religion, nor gets any Thing of the Na|ture of Religion, when it is wholly taken up in De|&s;criptions and Definitions of religious Doctrines, and Virtues.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Good</HI> of Religion, is like the Good of Food and Drink to the Creature, that wants it. And
<PB N="42" REF="019755_0052_0FACAD3A23286590">

And as it would be great Folly and Perver&s;ene&s;s, to accu&s;e a Man as an Enemy to the true U&s;e of Rea&s;oning about Food, becau&s;e he declares, that Rea&s;on is not Food, nor can &s;upply the Place of it; &s;o is it equally &s;o, to accu&s;e a Man, as an Enemy to the U&s;e of Rea|&s;oning in Religion, becau&s;e he declares that Rea&s;on|ing is not Religion, nor can &s;upply the Place of it. We have no Want of Religion, but becau&s;e we want to have more of the divine Nature in us, than we have in our fallen Nature. But if this be the Truth of the Matter (and who can deny it) then we are &s;ure, that nothing can be our Good in Religion, but that which communicates to us &s;omething of God, or which alters our State of Exi&s;tence in God, and makes us Partakers of the divine Nature, in &s;uch a Manner and Degree as we wanted. What a Folly then to put any Tru&s;t in a Religion of <HI>rational Noti|ons</HI> and Opinions logically deduced from Scripture Words. Do we not &s;ee Sinners of all Sorts, and Men under the Power of every corrupt Pa&s;&s;ion, equal|ly zealous for &s;uch a Religion? Proof enough, that it has not the Good of Religion in it, nor any Con|trariety to the Vices of the Heart; it neither kills them, nor is killed by them.

Dr. <HI>Warbur|ton</HI>'s Doctrine is this, that the in&s;pired Books of the New Te&s;tament, is that <HI>Comforter,</HI> or <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Truth,</HI> and Illuminator, which is meant by Chri&s;t's being <HI>always</HI> with his Church.&mdash;Let us therefore put the Doctor's Doctrine into the Letter of the Text, which will be&s;t &s;hew how true, or fal&s;e it is.</P>

<P>Chri&s;t &s;aith further; I <HI>have many Things to &s;ay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now; howbeit when He, the Spirit</HI> of <HI>Truth, is come, He &s;hall guide you into all Truth; for He &s;hall not &s;peak of Him&s;elf, for He &s;hall receive of mine,</HI> and <HI>&s;hall &s;hew it unto you</HI>; that is, though ye cannot be &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed from my Words at <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> yet when they &s;hall hereafter come to you in written Books, they will give you a Knowledge of all Truth, for they &s;hall not &s;peak of them&s;elves, but &s;hall receive Words from me, and &s;hew them unto you. <HI>Again,</HI> Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>The&s;e Things have I &s;poken unto you in Proverbs; but the Time cometh,</HI> when I &s;hall no more <HI>&s;peak unto you in Proverbs, but will &s;hew</HI> you <HI>plainly of the Father.</HI> That is, hitherto ye have only had &s;poken Proverbs from me, and therefore ye have not plainly known the Father; but the Time cometh, when the&s;e <HI>&s;poken</HI> Proverbs &s;hall be put into <HI>Writing,</HI> and then ye &s;hall plainly know the Father. <HI>Again,</HI> Chri&s;t adds, <HI>Ye now therefore have Sorrow, but</HI> I <HI>will &s;ee you again,</HI> and <HI>your Hearts &s;hall rejoice, and your Joy no Man taketh from you.</HI> That is, ye are now troubled at my per&s;onal Departure from you; but &s;ome written Books &s;hall be <HI>my &s;eeing you again,</HI> and in that Vi&s;it, ye &s;hall have &s;uch Joy as cannot be taken from you.</P>

<P>I exceedingly love and highly reverence the divine Authority of the &s;acred Writings of the Apo&s;tles and Evangeli&s;ts, and would gladly per&s;uade every one, to be as deeply affected with them, and pay as profound a Regard to them, as they would to an <HI>Elijah,</HI> a St. John <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> or a <HI>Paul,</HI> whom they knew to be immediately &s;ent from Heaven, with God's Me&s;&s;age to them.&mdash; I reverence them as a literal Truth of and from God, as much the <HI>greate&s;t heavenly Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> that can be <HI>out|wardly</HI> be&s;towed upon us.&mdash;I reverence them, as do|ing, or fitted to do, all that good among&s;t Chri&s;tians <HI>now,</HI> which the Apo&s;tles did in their Day, and as of the &s;ame U&s;e and Benefit to the Church of every Age, as their <HI>planting</HI> and <HI>watering</HI> was to the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But now, if this is not thought that Fullne&s;s of Re|gard, that is due to the holy Me&s;&s;engers of God; if any one will &s;till be &s;o learnedly wi&s;e, as to affirm, that though Paul's Preaching in his Epi&s;tles, whil&s;t he was alive, was indeed only bare planting and watering, but the &s;ame Epi&s;tles being publi&s;hed after his Death, got another Nature, became full of divine and living Power; &s;uch an one hath no Right to laugh (as the Doctor doth) at the &s;illy <HI>Mahometan,</HI> who believes the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to be <HI>uncreated.</HI> For wherever there in <HI>divine Efficacy,</HI> there, there mu&s;t be an <HI>uncreated</HI> Power.

Is not this Proof enough, that Nothing in man, but the Spirit of God in him, can know what the Spirit's Work in Man is, and does? The Fruits of the Spirit, &s;o often mentioned in Scripture, are not Things different, or &s;eparate from the Spirit, and if the Spirit is not always working in us, his Fruits mu&s;t be as ab&s;ent from us, as he is. St. <HI>John</HI> &s;aith, <HI>hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit, which he hath given us.</HI> A Demon&s;tra|tion, that the Spirit can no other Way make him&s;elf <HI>known</HI> to us, but by his dwelling and working in us. St. <HI>James</HI> &s;aith, <HI>every good and perfect Gift cometh from</HI> ABOVE: But now does not he in reality <HI>deny</HI> this, who &s;eeks for the <HI>highe&s;t Gift</HI> of Knowledge from BELOW, from the poor Contrivance of a <HI>Common-place</HI> Book? Again, If <HI>any Man lack Wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k it of God;</HI> St. <HI>James</HI> does not &s;ay, let him go a&s;k <HI>Peter,</HI> or <HI>Paul,</HI> or <HI>John,</HI> becau&s;e he knew, that divine Wi&s;dom, was Nothing el&s;e, but divine In&s;piration.&mdash;But Mr. <HI>Green</HI> has got together, his <HI>ingenious,</HI> his <HI>eminent</HI> Writers, his <HI>excellent, learned, judicious</HI> Authors, his <HI>cool, rational-morality</HI> Doc|tors (a &s;et of Men, who&s;e glorious Names we read no more of in the Go&s;pel, than of the profound <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> or the divine <HI>Cicero</HI>) and the&s;e are to do that for him, which the whole College of Apo&s;tles could do for no Body.&mdash;Now this Doctrine, that Nothing but the Spirit can know the Things that be of God; and that the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of the Spirit, is all the Knowledge we can have of him, is a Truth taught us, not only by all Scrip|ture, but by the whole Nature of Things. For every Thing, that can be &s;een, known, heard, felt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t be manife&s;ted by it&s;elf, and not by another. It is not po&s;&s;ible for any Thing but Light to manife&s;t Light, nor for any Thing but Darkne&s;s to make Darkne&s;s to be known. Yet this is more po&s;&s;ible, than for any Thing but divine In&s;piration, to make divine In&s;piration to be known. Hence there is a Degree of Delu&s;ion &s;till high|er, to be noted, in &s;uch Writers, as Mr. <HI>Green;</HI> for his collection of ingenious, eminent, rational Authors,
<PB N="56" REF="019755_0066_0FACAD44A34C1A30">
of whom he a&s;ks Coun&s;el concerning the Nece&s;&s;ity, of Certainty of the immediate In&s;piration of the Spirit, are &s;uch as deny it, and write again&s;t it. Therefore the Proceeding is ju&s;t as wi&s;e, as if a Man was to con&s;ult &s;ome ingenious, and eminent <HI>Athei&s;ts,</HI> about the Truth and Certainty of God's immediate, continual Provi|dence; or a&s;k a few &s;elect <HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> how, or what he was to believe of the Nature, and Power of go&s;pel Faith. Now there are the Holy Spirit's <HI>own Operations,</HI> and there are <HI>Reports</HI> about them. The only true Reports, are tho&s;e that are made by in&s;pired Per&s;ons; and if there were no &s;uch Per&s;ons, there could be no true Reports of the Matter. And therefore to con&s;ult unin&s;pired Per|&s;ons, and &s;uch as deny, and reproach the pretence to In|&s;piration, to be rightly in&s;tructed about the Truth of immediate, continual, divine In&s;piration, is a Degree of Blindne&s;s, greater than can be charged upon the old Jewi&s;h Scribes, and Phari&s;ees.</P>
<P>The Reports, that are to be acknowledged as true, concerning the Holy Spirit, and his Operations, are tho&s;e that are recorded in Scripture; that is, the Scriptures are an infallible Hi&s;tory, or Relation of that which the Holy Spirit is, and does, and works in true Believers; and al&s;o an infallible Direction how we are to &s;eek, and wait, and tru&s;t in his good Power over us. But then the Scriptures them&s;elves, though thus true, and in|fallible in the&s;e Reports, and In&s;tructions about the Holy Spirit, yet they can go no farther, than to be a true Hi&s;tory; they cannot give to the Reader of them, the <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> the <HI>Sen&s;ibility,</HI> and <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of that which they relate. This is plain, nof only from the Nature of a written Hi&s;tory or In&s;truction, but from the expre&s;s Words of our Lord, &s;aying, <HI>Except a Man be born again of the Spirit, he cannot &s;ee or enter into the Kingdom of God.</HI> Therefore the <HI>new Birth</HI> from above, or of the Spirit, is that alone, which gives true Knowledge and and Perception of that, which is the Kingdom of God. The Hi&s;tory may relate Truths enough about it; but the
<PB N="57" REF="019755_0067_0FACAD4564030268">
Kingdom of God, being Nothing el&s;e, but the Power, and Pre&s;ence of God, dwelling and ruling in our Souls, this can only manife&s;t it&s;elf, and can manife&s;t it&s;elf to Nothing in Man, but to the new Birth. For every Thing el&s;e in Man, is deaf and dumb and blind to the Kingdom of God; but when that which died in Adam, is made alive again by the quickening Spirit from above, this being the Birth which came at fir&s;t from God, and a Partaker of the divine Nature, this knows, finds, and enjoys the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P><HI>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t: this Record of Scripture is true; but what a Delu&s;ion, for a Man to think, that he knows and finds this to be true, and that Chri&s;t is all this Benefit, and Ble&s;&s;ing to him, becau&s;e he a&s;&s;ents, con&s;ents, and contends, it may be, for the Truth of tho&s;e Words. This is impo&s;&s;ible. The <HI>new Birth</HI> is here again the only Power of En|trance; every Thing el&s;e knocks at the Door in vain; I know you not &s;aith Chri&s;t to <HI>every Thing,</HI> but the new Birth.&mdash;<HI>I am the Way, the Truth and the Life,</HI> tells us neither more nor le&s;s, than if Chri&s;t had &s;aid, <HI>I am the Kingdom of God,</HI> into which Nothing can enter, but that which is born of the Spirit.</P>
<P>Here again may be &s;een in the highe&s;t Degree of cer|tainty, the <HI>ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of immediate, divine In&s;pira|tion, through every Part of the Chri&s;tian Life. For if a Birth of the Spirit, is that alone that can enter into, or receive the Kingdom of God, come among&s;t Men; that alone, which can find Chri&s;t to be the Way, the Truth and the Life; then a <HI>continual Life,</HI> or Breathing of the Spirit in us, mu&s;t be as nece&s;&s;ary, as the fir&s;t Birth of the Spirit. For a Birth of the Spirit, is only to make a Beginning of a <HI>Life</HI> of the Spirit; <HI>Birth</HI> is only in order to <HI>Life;</HI> if therefore the <HI>Life</HI> of the Spirit con|tinues not, the <HI>Birth</HI> is lo&s;t, and the Ce&s;&s;ation of its Breathing in us, is nothing el&s;e but <HI>Death</HI> again to the Kingdom of God, that is, to every Thing, that is, or can be godly. Therefore the <HI>immediate, continual</HI> In&s;pi|ration
<PB N="58" REF="019755_0068_0FACAB63E1CDFDE0">
of the Spirit, as the only po&s;&s;ible Power and Pre|&s;ervation of a Godly Life, &s;tands upon the &s;ame Ground, and is as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, as the new Birth.</P>
<P>Take away this Power, and working Life of the Spirit from being the <HI>one Life</HI> of all that is done in the Church, and then, though it be ever &s;o outwardly glorious in its Extent, or ever &s;o full of learned Members, it can be Nothing el&s;e in the Sight of God but the wi&s;e <HI>Greek,</HI> and the carnal <HI>Jew,</HI> become a Body of Water-baptized Chri&s;tians. For no &s;uch an one can be in a better State than this; the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Greek,</HI> the Carnality of the <HI>Jew,</HI> mu&s;t have the whole Government of him, till he is born of, and led by the Spirit of God; this alone is the Kingdom of God, and every Thing el&s;e is the King|dom of this World, in which Satan is declared to be the Prince.&mdash;Poor, mi&s;erable Man! that &s;trives with all the Sophi&s;try of human Wit, to be delivered from the immediate, continual Operation and Government of the Spirit of God, not con&s;idering, that where God is not, <HI>there</HI> is the Devil, and where the Spirit rules not, <HI>there</HI> all is the Work of the Fle&s;h, though nothing be talked of, but &s;piritual and Chri&s;tian Matters.

<P>How much then is it to be lamented, as well as im|po&s;&s;ible to be denied, that though all Scripture a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>the Things of the Spirit</HI> of God, are and mu&s;t, to the End of the World, be <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s to the natural</HI> Man; yet from almo&s;t one End of learned Chri&s;tendom to the other, nothing is thought of, as the true, and proper Means of attaining divine Knowledge, but that which every <HI>natural, &s;elfi&s;h, proud, envious, fal&s;e, vain-glorious,</HI> worldly Man can do. Where is that divinity Student,
<PB N="59" REF="019755_0069_0FACAB626AFD37F0">
who thinks, or was ever taught to think, of partaking of the Light of the Go&s;pel any other Way, than by do|ing with the Scriptures, that which he does with Pagan Writers, whether Poets, Orators, or Comedians, viz. exerci&s;e his Logic, Rhetoric, and critical Skill, in de&s;|canting upon them? This done, he is thought by him|&s;elf, and often by others, to have a &s;ufficiency of divine, apo&s;tolical Knowledge. What Wonder therefore if it &s;hould &s;ometimes happen, that the very &s;ame vain, cor|rupt, puffing Literature, that rai&s;es one Man to be a <HI>Poet-laureat,</HI> &s;hould &s;et another in a divinity Chair?</P>
<P>How is it, that the logical, critical, learned Dei&s;t comes by his Infidelity? Why ju&s;t by the &s;ame Help of the &s;ame good Powers of the <HI>natural Man,</HI> as many a learned Chri&s;tian comes to know, embrace, and contend for the Faith of the Go&s;pel. For, drop the Power and Reality of divine In&s;piration, and then all is dropt, that can &s;et the Believer above, or give him any godly Dif|ference from the Infidel. For the Chri&s;tian's Faith has no Goodne&s;s in it, but that it comes from <HI>above,</HI> is born <HI>of the Spirit;</HI> and the Dei&s;t's Infidelity has no Badne&s;s in it, but becau&s;e it comes <HI>from below,</HI> is born of the Will of Fle&s;h, and of the Will of Men, and rejects the Nece&s;&s;ity of being born again out of the Corruption of fallen Nature. The Chri&s;tian therefore that rejects, reproaches, and writes again&s;t the Nece&s;&s;ity of immedi|ate, divine In&s;piration, pleads the whole Cau&s;e of Infide|lity; he confirms the Ground, on which it &s;tands; and has nothing to prove the Goodne&s;s of his own Chri&s;tia|nity, but that which equally proves to the Dei&s;t, the Goodne&s;s of his Infidelity. For without the new Birth, or which is the &s;ame Thing, without immediate, con|tinual, divine In&s;piration, the Difference between the Chri&s;tian, and the Infidel, is quite lo&s;t; and whether the unin&s;pired, unregenerate, Son of Adam, be in the Church, or out of the Church, he is &s;till that Child of this World, <HI>that</HI> fallen Adam, and mere natural Man, to whom the <HI>Things of the Spirit of</HI> God, are and mu&s;t
<PB N="60" REF="019755_0070_0FACAB636CB95B28">
be fooli&s;hne&s;s. For a full Proof of this, no more need be &s;een, than that which you cannot help &s;eeing, that the &s;ame &s;hining <HI>Virtues,</HI> and the &s;ame glaring <HI>Vices</HI> are common to them both. For the Chri&s;tian, not made &s;uch, by the Spirit of God continually in&s;piring, and working in him, has only a Chri&s;tianity of his own making, and <HI>can</HI> have only &s;uch <HI>Appearances</HI> of Virtues, and <HI>will</HI> have &s;uch <HI>reality</HI> of Vices, as <HI>natural Self</HI> wants to have. Let him therefore renounce what is called <HI>natural Religion,</HI> as much as he will, yet unle&s;s he is a new born, and divinely in&s;pired Chri&s;tian, he mu&s;t live and die in all his <HI>natural Corruption.</HI></P>
<P>Through all Scripture, nothing el&s;e is aimed at, or intended for Man, as his Chri&s;tianity, but the divine Life; nor any Thing hinted at, as having the lea&s;t Pow|er to rai&s;e, or beget it, but the holy, Life-giving Spirit of God.&mdash;How gro&s;s therefore is that Blindne&s;s, which reading the Go&s;pel, and the Hi&s;tory of Go&s;pel Chri&s;tians, cannot &s;ee the&s;e two fundamental Truths, (1) <HI>that Nothing is divine Knowledge in Man, but the divine Life:</HI> (2) <HI>That the divine Life in Nothing el&s;e, but a Birth of the divine Nature within him</HI>?</P>
<P>But this Truth being lo&s;t, or given up, vain Learn|ing, and a worldly Spirit, being in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Go&s;pel-book,</HI> &s;et up Kingdoms of <HI>Strife</HI> and <HI>Divi&s;ion.</HI>&mdash; For what End? Why, that the <HI>Unity</HI> of the Church may not be lo&s;t. Multiply Sy&s;tems of empty Notions and Opinions: For what? Why, that Words, and Forms may do <HI>that</HI> for the Church <HI>now,</HI> which to the fir&s;t Church, of Chri&s;t's own forming, could only be done, by being <HI>born of the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it is, that the Scripture-&s;cholar is looked upon as having <HI>divine Knowledge</HI> of its Matters, when he is as ready at Chapter and Ver&s;e, as the Critic is at every Page of <HI>Cicero.</HI> And nothing is looked upon as defec|tive in divinity Knowledge, but &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ed Mi&s;|takes of the Genius of the Hebrew, or Greek Letter, as the &s;ublime Students of the &s;amed Words of a

<HI>Milton,</HI> or a <HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> charge, as <HI>Blunders</HI> upon one another.</P>
<P>Now to call &s;uch Scripture Skill, <HI>divine Knowledge,</HI> is ju&s;t as &s;olid, and judicious, as if a Man was &s;aid, or thought to <HI>know,</HI> that which St. <HI>John knew,</HI> becau&s;e he could &s;ay his whole <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> and <HI>Epi&s;tles</HI> by Heart, with|out mi&s;&s;ing a Word of them. For a literal Knowledge of Scripture, is but like having all Scripture in the Me|mory; and is &s;o far from being a <HI>divine Perception</HI> of the Things &s;poken of, that the mo&s;t vicious, wicked Scholar in the World, may attain to the highe&s;t Perfec|tion in it. But divine Knowledge and Wickedne&s;s of Life, are &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent, that they are mutual Death and De&s;truction to one another; where the one is alive, the other mu&s;t be dead&mdash;<HI>Judas I&s;cariot</HI> knew Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and all that he &s;aid and did to his Crucifixion; he knew what it was to be at the Lord's Table, and to partake of his Supper of Bread and Wine. But yet, with much more Truth it may be &s;aid, that he knew nothing e&s;&s;entially of all this, and had no better a Know|ledge of it, than <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> had. Now all Know|ledge of Chri&s;t, but that which is from divine In&s;pira|tion, or the New-birth, is but as poor and profitle&s;s, as <HI>Judas</HI> his Knowledge was. It may &s;ay to Chri&s;t, as he did, <HI>Hail Ma&s;ter;</HI> but no one <HI>can call Je&s;us Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.</HI>&mdash;This empty Letter-learned Knowledge, which the natural Man can as ea&s;ily have of the &s;acred Scripture, and religious Matters, as of any other Books, or human Affairs; this being taken for <HI>divine Knowledge,</HI> has &s;pread &s;uch Darkne&s;s and De|lu&s;ion all over Chri&s;tendom, as may be reckoned no le&s;s than a general Apo&s;ta&s;y from the go&s;pel State of <HI>divine Illumination.</HI> For the go&s;pel State is in its whole Na|ture nothing el&s;e; it has but one Light, and that is the <HI>Lamb of God;</HI> it has but one Life, and that is by the Spirit of God. Whatever is not of, and from this Light, and governed by this Spirit, call it by what high Name you will, is no more a Part of the go&s;pel State,

<P>Let then the high accompli&s;hed Scholar reflect, that he comes by his Wit, and Parts, and acute Abilities, ju&s;t as the <HI>Serpent</HI> came by his Subtilty; let him reflect, that he might as well dream of acquiring angelic Purity to his animal Nature, by multiplying new invented De|lights for his earthly Pa&s;&s;ions, and Tempers, as of rai&s;|ing his Soul into divine Knowledge, through the <HI>well exerci&s;ed</HI> Powers of his natural Rea&s;on, and Imagina|tion.</P>
<P>The fine&s;t intellectual Power, and that which has the be&s;t Help in it, towards bringing Man again into the Region of divine Light, is that poor, de&s;pi&s;ed Thing, called <HI>Simplicity.</HI> This is that, which &s;tops the Work|ings of the fallen Life of Nature, and leaves room for

<P>But lamentable as this is, the <HI>Letter</HI> of Scripture hath been &s;o long the u&s;urped Province of School-critics, and learned Rea&s;oners making their Markets of it, that the Difference between literal, notional, and living, divine Knowledge, is almo&s;t quite lo&s;t in the Chri&s;tian World.

<P>The true Nature, and full Di&s;tinction between <HI>literal</HI> and <HI>divine</HI> Knowledge, is &s;et forth in the highe&s;t Degree of Clearne&s;s, in the&s;e Words of our Saviour, <HI>The King|dom of God is like a Trea&s;ure in a Field:</HI> Thus far, is the true U&s;e, and Benefit, and utmo&s;t Power of the <HI>Letter,</HI> it can tell us of a Trea&s;ure that we want, a Trea&s;ure that belongs to us, and how and where it is to be found; but when it is added, that a <HI>Man goeth</HI> and <HI>&s;elleth all
<PB N="81" REF="019755_0091_0FACAC2FE98CB030">
that he hath,</HI> and <HI>buyeth that Field,</HI> then beginneth the <HI>divine Knowledge,</HI> which is nothing el&s;e, but the Trea|&s;ure <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,</HI> and <HI>enjoyed.</HI> Now what is here &s;aid, is the &s;ame that is &s;aid in the&s;e other Words of Chri&s;t, <HI>ex|cept a Man deny him&s;elf and for&s;ake all that he hath, he cannot be my Di&s;ciple</HI>; that is, he cannot partake of my <HI>Mind,</HI> my <HI>Spirit,</HI> and my <HI>Nature,</HI> and therefore cannot know me; he is only a Hearer of a Trea&s;ure, without entering into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and Enjoyment of it. And thus it is with all Scripture, the <HI>Letter</HI> can only direct to the doing of that which it cannot do, and give No|tice of &s;omething that it cannot give.</P>
<P>Now clear and evident as this Di&s;tinction is, between a mere literal Direction to a Thing, and a real Parti|cipation of it, which alone is a true Perception of it, the generality of Chri&s;tians &s;eem quite in&s;en&s;ible of any other religious Perception, or Knowledge of divine Things, but &s;uch Ideas, or Notions of them, as a Man can form from Scripture Words. Whereas <HI>Good and Evil,</HI> the only Objects of religious Knowledge, are an <HI>inward State,</HI> and <HI>Growth</HI> of our Life, they are in us, are a Part of us, ju&s;t in the &s;ame Manner, as <HI>&s;eeing and hearing</HI> are in us, and we can have no real Knowledge of them any other way, than as we have of our own <HI>&s;eeing, and hearing.</HI> And as no Man can get or lo&s;e his &s;eeing, or hearing, or have le&s;s, or more of them, by any <HI>Ideas,</HI> or <HI>Notions,</HI> that he forms about them, ju&s;t &s;o it is with that, which is the Power of <HI>Good,</HI> and the Power of <HI>Evil</HI> in us, Notions and Ideas have no effect upon it. Yet no other Knowledge is thought of, or &s;ought after, or e&s;teemed of any Value, but that which is notional and the Work of the Brain.</P>
<P>Thus, as &s;oon as a Man of Speculation can demon|&s;trate that, which he calls the <HI>Being and Attributes of God,</HI> he thinks, and others think, that he truly <HI>knows</HI> God. But what Excu&s;e can be made for &s;uch an Imagi|nation, when plain Scripture has told him, that <HI>to know God is eternal Life,</HI> that is, to know God, is to have

For to know what Faith is, or that we are in the Faith, is to know that Chri&s;t is in us of a Truth; it is to know the Power of his Life, his Sufferings, his Death, his Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion, made good in our Souls. To be in the Faith, is to have done with all <HI>Notions</HI> and <HI>Opinions</HI> about it, becau&s;e it is found and felt by its living Power and Fruits within us, which are <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Peace,</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> in the Holy Gho&s;t. All which, are three Names, or Powers, peculiar to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; he alone is our Righteou&s;ne&s;s, our Peace, our Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t. And therefore Faith is not in us, by Rea&s;on of this or that Opinion, A&s;&s;ent or Con&s;ent, but it is Chri&s;t, or the divine Nature in us; or its Operations could not be Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Peace and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.&mdash;<HI>By Faith ye are &s;aved,</HI> has no other Meaning than by Chri&s;t ye are &s;aved. And if Faith in its whole Nature, in its Root and Growth, was any Thing el&s;e but Chri&s;t, or a Birth of the divine Nature within us, it could do us no Good, no Power could be a&s;cribed to it, it could not be our Victory, it could not overcome the World, the Fle&s;h, and the Devil.&mdash;Every Faith, that is not Chri&s;t in us, is but a dead Faith.</P>
<P>How trifling therefore (to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it) is that Learning, which &s;ets up a Difference between <HI>Faith</HI> and its <HI>Works,</HI> between a Ju&s;tification by Faith, and Ju&s;ti|fication by its Works.&mdash;Is there any Difference be|tween Chri&s;t, as a <HI>Redeemer,</HI> and his <HI>redeeming Works?</HI> Can they be &s;et above one another in their redeeming

Efficacy? If not, then Faith and its Works, which are nothing el&s;e but Chri&s;t in us, can have no &s;eparation from, or excellency above one another, but are as &s;trict|ly one, as Chri&s;t is one, and no more two Things, than our Saviour, and our Salvation are two <HI>different</HI> Things in us. Every Thing that is &s;aid of Faith, from Adam to this Day, is only &s;o much &s;aid of the Power, and Life of a one redeeming Chri&s;t, <HI>working within us</HI>; &s;o that to divide Faith from its Works, is as ab&s;urd, as to divide a Thing from its &s;elf, a <HI>Circle</HI> from its <HI>Roundne&s;s.</HI> No Salvation would have ever been a&s;cribed to Faith, but becau&s;e it is in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e, <HI>Chri&s;t him&s;elf,</HI> the Power of God, <HI>living</HI> and <HI>working</HI> in us. It never would have been &s;aid of Faith, that every Power of the World, the Fle&s;h and the Devil, mu&s;t yield to it, but becau&s;e it is that very Chri&s;t within us, <HI>without whom we can do nothing.</HI> But if without Chri&s;t we can do nothing, and yet <HI>all things are po&s;&s;ible to our Faith,</HI> can there be a fuller Demon&s;tration, that our Faith is no|thing el&s;e but Chri&s;t born, and living within us? What|ever therefore there is of Power within us, that ten|deth to Salvation, call it by what Name you will, either <HI>Faith,</HI> or <HI>Hope,</HI> or <HI>Prayer,</HI> or <HI>Hunger</HI> after the King|dom of God, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, it is all but <HI>one Power,</HI> and that one Power is Chri&s;t <HI>within us.</HI> If therefore Faith, and its good Works are but one and the &s;ame Chri&s;t <HI>living in us,</HI> the Di&s;tinction between a good Faith, and its good Works, and all the con|tentious Volumes that have been written about it, are as mere ignorant Jargon, as a Di&s;tinction made, and contended for, between <HI>Life,</HI> and its living <HI>Opera|tions.</HI></P>
<P>When the holy Church of Chri&s;t, the Kingdom of God come among&s;t men, was fir&s;t &s;et up, it was the Apo&s;tle's Boa&s;t, that all other Wi&s;dom, or Learning was &s;unk into nothing. <HI>Where,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is the Wi&s;e, the Scribe, the Di&s;puter of this World? Hath not God made them Fooli&s;hne&s;s?</HI> But now, it is the Boa&s;t of all Church|es,
<PB N="84" REF="019755_0094_0FACAC32261680E8">
that they are full of the <HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Scribes,</HI> the <HI>Di&s;|puters</HI> of <HI>this</HI> World, who &s;it with learned Pomp in the apo&s;tles Chair, and have the My&s;teries of the Kingdom of God committed to them.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that from a Religion of heavenly Love, built upon the redeeming Life, and Doctrines of a Son of God, dying to &s;ave the whole World, Divi&s;ion, Bit|terne&s;s, Envy, Pride, Strife, Hatred, and Per&s;ecution, nay every Outrage of War and Blood-&s;hed, breathe and break forth with more Strength in learned Chri&s;tendom, than ever they did from a Religion of Pagan Idolatry, &s;et up by Satan.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be here &s;aid, mu&s;t there then be no Learning or Scholar&s;hip, no recondite Erudition in the Chri&s;tian Church? Mu&s;t there be nothing thought of, or gotten by the Go&s;pel, but <HI>mere Salvation</HI>? Mu&s;t its Mini&s;ters know nothing, teach nothing, but &s;uch Salva|tion-doctrines, as Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles taught; no|thing but the <HI>full Denial</HI> of Self, Poverty of Spirit, Meekne&s;s, and Humility, and unwearied Patience, a never cea&s;ing Love, an ab&s;olute Renunciation of the Pomps and Vanities of the World, a full Dependance upon our Heavenly Father; no Joy or rejoicing but in the Holy Gho&s;t; no Wi&s;dom but that which God gives; no Walking but as Chri&s;t walked; no Reward or Glory for their Labours of Love, but that of being <HI>found in Chri&s;t,</HI> Fle&s;h of his Fle&s;h, Bone of his Bones, Spirit of his Spirit, and cloathed with the Wedding-garment, when the Bridegroom cometh, <HI>when the Lord him&s;elf &s;hall de&s;cend from Heaven with a Shout, with the Voice of the Archangel, and with the Trumpet of God, and the Dead in Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall ri&s;e fir&s;t?</P>
<P>To this the fir&s;t An&s;wer is, Happy, thrice happy are they, who are only the thus learned Preachers of the Go&s;pel, who through all their Mini&s;tr, &s;eek nothing for them&s;elves, or others, but <HI>to be taught of God</HI>; hun|ger after nothing but the Bread of Life that came down from Heaven, owning no Ma&s;ter but Chri&s;t, no Teacher

but his Holy Spirit; as unable to join with the Diggers in Pagan Pits of Learning, as with tho&s;e that <HI>Labour for the Wind, and give their Money for that, which is not Bread.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> with regard to the Demand of <HI>learned Know|ledge</HI> in the Chri&s;tian Church, it may be an&s;wered, that all that has been &s;aid above, is only for the <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> and <HI>Promotion</HI> of it, and that all Ignorance and Darkne&s;s may be driven quite out of it.&mdash;The Church of Chri&s;t is the Seat or School of all the highe&s;t Knowledge that the human Nature is capable of in this Life. Ignorance is every where but in the Church of Chri&s;t.&mdash;The Law, the Prophets, and the Go&s;pel are the only Trea&s;ures of all that can be called, the Knowledge either of God or Man; and he in whom the Law, the Prophets, and the Go&s;pel are fulfilled, is the only well-educated Man, and one of the fir&s;t-rate Scholars in the World. But now, who is he, that has this Wi&s;dom from the&s;e rich Trea|&s;ures? Who is he, in whom all is known, and fulfilled, which they teach? The Lip of Truth has told us, that it is he, and he alone, <HI>who loves God with all his Heart, with all his Soul, with all his Mind, and with all his Strength, and his Neighbour as him&s;elf.</HI> This is the Man, that is all Wi&s;dom, all Light, and let into full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all, that is meant by all the My&s;teries con|tained in the Law, the Prophets, and the Go&s;pel.&mdash; Where this divine Love is wanting, and a diabolical Self &s;its in its Place, there may be great <HI>Wits,</HI> &s;hining <HI>Critics, Orators, Poets,</HI> &amp;c. as ea&s;ily as there may be a profound <HI>Machiavel,</HI> a learned <HI>Hobbs,</HI> or an athei&s;tical <HI>Virtuo&s;o.</HI> But would you divinely know the My&s;teries of Nature, the Ground and Rea&s;on of Good and Evil in this World, the Relation and Connexion between the vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible World, how the Things of Time proceed from, are influenced by, and depend upon the Things and Powers of Eternity, there is but <HI>one only</HI> Key of En|trance; nothing can open the Vi&s;ion, but &s;eeing with the Eyes of that <HI>&s;ame Love,</HI> which began and carries on,
<PB N="86" REF="019755_0096_0FACAC33A30539A8">
all that is, and works in vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible Nature.&mdash; Would you <HI>divinely</HI> know the My&s;teries of Grace and Salvation, would you go forth as a faithful Witne&s;s of go&s;pel Truths, &s;tay till this Fire of divine Love has had its perfect Work within you. For till your Heart is an Altar, on which this heavenly Fire never goes out, you are dead in your&s;elf, and can only be a Speaker of dead Words, about Things, that never had any Life within you. For without a real Birth of this divine Love in the e&s;&s;ence of your Soul, be as learned and polite as you will, your Heart is but the dark Heart of fallen Adam, and your Knowledge of the Kingdom of God, will be only like that which murdering <HI>Cain</HI> had. &mdash;For every Thing is Murder, but that which Love doth.&mdash;If Love is not the Breath of your Life, the Spirit that forms and governs every Thing that proceeds from you, every Thing that has your Labour, your Al|lowance and Con&s;ent; you are <HI>broken off</HI> from the Works of God, you have left <HI>his Creation,</HI> you are without God, and your Name and Nature and Works, can have no other Name, or Nature, but that which is called Pride, Wrath, Envy, Hypocri&s;y, Hatred, Revenge and Self-ex|altation under the Power of Satan in his Kingdom of Darkne&s;s&mdash;Nothing can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ave you from being the certain Prey of all the&s;e evil Spirits, through the whole Cour&s;e of your Life, but a Birth of <HI>that Love,</HI> which is God him&s;elf, his Light, and Spirit within you.</P>
<P>There is no Knowledge in Heaven, but what pro|ceeds from this Birth of Love, nor is there any Differ|ence between the highe&s;t Light of an Angel, and the horrid Darkne&s;s of a Devil, but that which Love has made.&mdash;But now, &s;ince divine Love can have no Beginning, but from a Birth of the divine Nature in us, therefore &s;aith St. John, we love him becau&s;e he FIRST loved us, the &s;ame as &s;aying, we de&s;ire God, becau&s;e he <HI>fir&s;t</HI> de&s;ired us&punc; for we could not de&s;ire God, but becau&s;e he fir&s;t de&s;ired us, we could not turn to God, but becau&s;e he fir&s;t turned to us. And &s;o it is,
<PB N="87" REF="019755_0097_0FACAC346291CAE0">
that we could not love God, but becau&s;e he <HI>fir&s;t</HI> loved us, that is, becau&s;e he <HI>fir&s;t</HI> by our Creation brought forth, and by our Redemption continued, and kept up that &s;ame Birth of his own Spirit of Love in us.&mdash;For as his holy Spirit mu&s;t <HI>fir&s;t</HI> be a Gift to us, or born in us, and then we have <HI>that,</HI> which can <HI>wor&s;hip God in Spirit;</HI> &s;o his Love mu&s;t of all Nece&s;&s;ity be a Gift to us, or born in us, and then we have <HI>that of God</HI> in us, which alone can love him with his own Love.&mdash;A Truth, ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;erted in the&s;e Words; <HI>Love is of God, and he that loveth, is born of God.</HI></P>
<P>Let this be my Excu&s;e to the learned World, for owning no School of Wi&s;dom, but where the <HI>one only</HI> Le&s;&s;on, is divine Love; and the <HI>one only</HI> Teacher, the Spirit of God. Let no one call this, wild or extrava|gant; it is no wilder a Step, no more injurious to Man, to Truth and Goodne&s;s, than the owning no God but one.&mdash;For to be called from every Thing but divine Love, and the Spirit of God, is only being called from every Thing, that has the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> of fallen Nature in it. &mdash;And no Man can come from under this Cur&s;e, till he is born again of divine Love, and the Spirit of God. For thus to be born, is as much the one &s;ole Happine&s;s, Joy and Glory of Men, both now and ever, as it is the &s;ole Joy and Glory of Angels eternally in the Heavens. &mdash;Believe me then, thou great Scholar, that all that thou ha&s;t got of Wi&s;dom or Learning, Day after Day, in any other School but this, will &s;tand thee in as much Stead, fill thee with as high, heavenly Comfort at the Hour of Death, as all the long Dreams, which Night after Night, thou ha&s;t ever had in thy Sleep.&mdash;And till a Man knows this, with as much fullne&s;s of Con|viction, as he knows the Vanity of a Dream, he has his full Proof, that he is not yet in the Light of Truth, not yet <HI>taught of God,</HI> nor like-minded with Chri&s;t.</P>

Therefore &s;aith the Chri&s;t of God, <HI>I am the Light of the World,</HI> becau&s;e he alone is the Birth of Heaven in the fallen Souls of Men.&mdash;But now who can more reject this divine Light, or more plainly choo&s;e Darkne&s;s in&s;tead of it, than he who &s;eeks to have his Mind enriched, the Fa|culties of his fallen Soul cultivated by the Literature of Poets, Orators, Philo&s;ophers, Sophi&s;ts, Sceptics, and Critics, born and bred up in the Wor&s;hip and Prai&s;es of

<P>Say now, out of Reverence to &s;ound Literature, and Abhorrence of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, that the Kingdom of God is not really and virtually within, that its heavenly Fire, Light, and Spirit, are not, ought not to be born in a &s;ober, right-minded Follower of Chri&s;t, and then you have a <HI>good</HI> Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, as ab&s;olutely dead to the Kingdom of Heaven, as the <HI>Corps</HI> that hath nothing of the Fire, Spirit, and Light of this World in it, is dead to all the outward World round about it.</P>
<P>What a Sobriety of Faith and &s;ound Doctrine is it, to preach up a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of being living Members of the Kingdom of Heaven, and at the &s;ame time, the <HI>Nece&s;|&s;ity</HI> of orthodoxly holding, that <HI>a heavenly Birth,</HI> nei|ther

is, nor can, nor ought to be within us! For if it either is, or could, or ought to be within us, then it could not be a brain-&s;ick Folly to believe, that the literal Words of Chri&s;t, had no Deceit, Fal&s;ity, or Delu&s;ion in them, when he &s;aid, <HI>Except a Man be born again from above, he cannot &s;ee, or enter</HI> into the Kingdom of God. That is, he cannot po&s;&s;ibly have any Godlike, or divine Goodne&s;s, he cannot be a Child of an heavenly Father, but from the Nature and Spirit of his heavenly Father brought to a real Birth of Life in him.&mdash;Now if with|out this divine Birth, all that we have in us, is but fallen Adam, a Birth of Sin, the Fle&s;h, and the Devil, if the Power of this heavenly Birth is all the Power of Goodne&s;s that is, or was, or ever can be in a Son of Adam; and if Logic, Learning, and Critici&s;m, are al|mo&s;t every where &s;et in high Places, to pronounce and prove it to be mere Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and &s;piritual Phrenzy, what Wonder is it, if Folly of Doctrine, Wickedne&s;s of Life, Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h, Profanene&s;s of Spirit, Wan|tonne&s;s of Wit, Contempt of Goodne&s;s and <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, &s;hould all of them &s;eem to have their full <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> among&s;t us?</P>
<P>What Wonder, if Sacraments, Church-prayers, and Preachings, leave high and low, learned and unlearned, Men and Women, Prie&s;ts and People, as unaltered in all their aged Vices, as they leave Children unchanged in their childi&s;h Follies? For where the <HI>one only</HI> Fountain of Life and Goodne&s;s is for&s;aken, where the Seed of the divine Birth is not alive, and going forwards in the Birth, all the Difference between Man and Man, is as nothing with re&s;pect to the Kingdom of God.&mdash;It matters not what name is given to the old earthly Man of Adam's be&s;tial Fle&s;h and Blood, whether he be called a zealous <HI>Churchman,</HI> a &s;tiff-necked <HI>Jew,</HI> a polite civi|lized <HI>Heathen,</HI> or a grave <HI>Infidel</HI>; under all the&s;e Names, the unregenerate old Man, has but one and the &s;ame Nature, without any other Difference but that, which <HI>Time,</HI> and <HI>Place, Education, Complexion, Hypocri&s;y,</HI> and

<P>That the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian Church, &s;tand at this Day in the <HI>&s;ame Kind</HI> of Apo&s;tacy, or fallen State, mu&s;t be manife&s;t to every one, that will not &s;hut his Eyes again&s;t it. Why are the Jews in a fallen State? It is be|cau&s;e they have refu&s;ed him, who in his whole Proce&s;s, was the Truth, the Sub&s;tance, the Life, and Fulfilling of all that, which was outwardly taught, and pre&s;cribed in their Law and Prophets.</P>
<P>But is it not as ea&s;y to &s;ee, that the whole Chri&s;tian Church are in a fallen State, and for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, becau&s;e they are fallen, or turned away from that Holy Spirit who was promi&s;ed, and given to be the <HI>one only</HI> Power, Life, and Fulfilling of all that, which was <HI>out|wardly</HI> taught, and pre&s;cribed by the Go&s;pel. For the Holy Spirit to come, was ju&s;t the &s;ame ALL, and FUL|FILLING of the whole Go&s;pel, as a Chri&s;t to come, was the <HI>all,</HI> and the <HI>Fulfilling</HI> of the Law.&mdash;The Jew therefore with his Old Te&s;tament, not owning Chri&s;t in all his Proce&s;s to be the Truth and Life, and Fulfiller of their Law, is ju&s;t in that &s;ame Apo&s;ta&s;y, as the Chri&s;tian with his New Te&s;tament, not owning the Ho|ly Spirit in all his Operations, to be his only Light, Guide, and Governor.&mdash;For as all Types and Figures in the Law, were but empty Shadows without Chri&s;t's being the Life and Power of them, &s;o all that is written in the Go&s;pel is but dead Letter, unle&s;s the Holy Spirit in Man, be the living Reader, the living Rememberer, and the living Doer of them. Therefore where the Holy Spirit is not thus owned and received, as the <HI>whole Power,</HI> and Life of the Go&s;pel State, it is no Marvel, that Chri&s;tians have no more of go&s;pel Virtues, than the Jews have of patriarchal Holine&s;s, or that the &s;ame

Lu&s;ts and Vices which pro&s;per among&s;t Jews, &s;hould break forth with as much Strength in fallen Chri&s;ten|dom. For the New Te&s;tament not ending in the Com|ing of the Holy Spirit, with Fulne&s;s of Power over Sin and Hell, and the Devil, is but the &s;ame, and no better a Help to <HI>Heaven,</HI> than the Old Te&s;tament without the Coming of a Me&s;&s;iah.&mdash;Need I now &s;ay any more, to demon&s;trate the Truth of that, which I fir&s;t &s;aid was the one Thing ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential, and only available to Man's Salvation, namely, the SPIRIT of God brought again to his FIRST POWER of LIFE IN US. This was the Glory of Man's Creation, and this alone can be the Glory of his Redemption.&mdash;All be&s;ides this, that pa&s;&s;es for a <HI>Time</HI> betwixt God and Man, be it what it will, &s;hews only our Fall, and Di&s;tance from God and in its be&s;t State, has only the Nature of a good Road, which is only good, becau&s;e that which we want, is at the End of it.&mdash;Whil&s;t God calls us by various out|ward Di&s;pen&s;ations, by creaturely Things, figurative In&s;titutions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is a full Proof, that we are not yet in our true State, or that Union with God, which is intended by our Redemption.</P>
<P>God &s;aid to <HI>Mo&s;es, Put off thy Shoes, for the Place whereon thou &s;tande&s;t is holy Ground.</HI> Now this which God &s;aid to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> is only that very &s;ame Thing, which Circumci&s;ion, the Law, Sacrifices, and Sacraments, &s;ay to Man. They are in them&s;elves nothing el&s;e but out|ward Significations of <HI>inward Impurity,</HI> and <HI>lo&s;t Holine&s;s,</HI> and can do no more in them&s;elves, but intimate, point, and direct to an <HI>inward Life,</HI> and new Birth from above, that is to be &s;ought after.</P>
<P>But here lies the great Mi&s;take, or rather idolatrous Abu&s;e of all God's outward Di&s;pen&s;ations.&mdash;They are taken for the Thing it&s;elf, for the Truth and E&s;&s;ence of Religion. That which the learned Jews did with the outward Letter of their Law, that &s;ame do learned Chri&s;tians with the outward Letter of their Go&s;pel.&mdash; Why did the Jewi&s;h Church &s;o furiou&s;ly and ob&s;tinately

cry out again&s;t Chri&s;t, Let him be crucified?

<P>Need it now be a&s;ked, whether the true Chri&s;t of the Go&s;pel, be le&s;s bla&s;phemed, le&s;s crucified by that Chri&s;|tian Theology, which rejects an inward Chri&s;t, a Savi|our living and working in the Soul, as its inward Light and Life, generating his own Nature and Spirit in it, as its only Redemption, whether that which rejects all this as my&s;tic Madne&s;s, be not that very &s;ame old Jewi&s;h Wi&s;dom, &s;prung up in Chri&s;tian Theology, which &s;aid of Chri&s;t, when teaching the&s;e very Things, <HI>He is mad, why hear ye Him?</HI> Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord in a Parable &s;ets forth the blind Jews, as &s;aying of him&s;elf, <HI>We will not have this man to reign</HI> OVER us.&mdash;The &s;ober minded Chri&s;tian Scholar has none of this Jewi&s;h Blind|ne&s;s, he only &s;aith of Chri&s;t, we will not have this Man to REIGN IN US, and &s;o keeps clear of &s;uch my&s;tic Ab&s;urdity, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> fell into, when he enthu&s;ia&s;tically &s;aid, <HI>Yet not I, but Chri&s;t that liveth in me.</HI></P>

<P>But now Corruption, Sin, Death, and every Evil of the World, have entered into the Church, the Spou&s;e of Chri&s;t, ju&s;t as they entered into Eve, the Spou&s;e of Adam in Paradi&s;e, in the &s;ame Way, and from the &s;ame Cau&s;e, <HI>viz. a De&s;ire of more, or other Knowledge, than that which comes from God alone.</HI>&mdash;This De&s;ire is the Serpent's Voice <HI>within</HI> every Man, which does all that to him, and in him, which the Serpent at the Tree did to Eve.&mdash; It carries on the fir&s;t Deceit, it &s;hews and recommends to him that &s;ame beautiful Tree of <HI>own Will, own Wit,</HI> and <HI>own Wi&s;dom,</HI> &s;pringing up within him, which <HI>Eve</HI>

<P>The Light which broke out at the <HI>Reformation,</HI> ab|horred the bloody, &s;uper&s;titious Zeal of the&s;e Catholic Heroes.&mdash;But (N.

<P>Now who can help &s;eeing, that Satan, the Prince of the Powers of Darkne&s;s, had here a much greater Tri|umph over Chri&s;tendom, than in all the holy Wars, and Croi&s;ades that went before?

For there is not a Virtue of Go&s;pel-goodne&s;s, but has its Death-blow from it.&mdash;For no Virtue hath any Go&s;pel-goodne&s;s in it any farther, than as it hath its Birth, and Growth, in and from the Spi|rit of Chri&s;t; where his Nature and Spirit is not, there is nothing but the Heathen to be found, which is but &s;aying the &s;ame Truth, as when the Apo&s;tle &s;aid, that he who <HI>hath not,</HI> or is <HI>not led by the Spirit of Chri&s;t, is none of his.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="019755_0117_0FACACD127A2F900">Now fancy to your&s;elf, Chri&s;t, the Lamb of God, after his divine Sermon on the Mount, putting him&s;elf at the Head of a blood-thir&s;ty Army, or St. <HI>Paul</HI> going forth with a Squadon of Fire and Brim&s;tone, to make more Havock in human Lives, than a devouring Earth|quake.</P>
<P>But if this be too bla&s;phemous an Ab&s;urdity to be &s;uppo&s;ed, what follows, but that the Chri&s;tian who acts in the de&s;troying Fury of War, acts in full Contrariety to the whole Nature and Spirit of Chri&s;t, and can no more be &s;aid to be led by his Spirit, or be one with him, than tho&s;e his Enemies, who <HI>came forth with Swords and Staves for to take him.</HI></P>
<P>Blinded Prote&s;tants think they have the Glory of &s;laughtering blind Papi&s;ts; and the victorious Papi&s;t claims the Merit of having conquered Troops of Here|tics; but alas! the Conque&s;t is equally great on both Sides, both are entitled to the &s;ame Victory; and the glorious Victory on both Sides, is only that of having <HI>go&s;pel Goodne&s;s</HI> equally under their Feet.</P>

the &s;ame Hero making the &s;ame Ravage from Coun|try to Country with Chri&s;tian Soldiers, has more Thanks from the Devil, than twenty Pagan <HI>Alexanders</HI> would ever have had.&mdash;To make Men kill Men, is Meat and Drink to that roaring Adver&s;ary of Mankind, who goeth about &s;eeking whom he may devour. But to make Chri&s;tians kill Chri&s;tians for the Sake of Chri&s;t's Church, is his highe&s;t <HI>Triumph</HI> over the highe&s;t <HI>Mark,</HI> which Chri&s;t hath &s;et upon tho&s;e whom he has purcha&s;ed by his Blood.&mdash;<HI>This Commandment,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>I give unto you, that ye love one another.&mdash;By this &s;hall all Men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye love one another as I have loved you.</HI>&mdash;</P>

<P>Now imagine the Duelli&s;t <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> and <HI>confe&s;&s;ing</HI> his Sins to God to Day, becau&s;e he is engaged to fight his Brother To-morrow; fancy again the Conqueror got into his Clo&s;et, on his bended Knees, lifting up Hands and Heart to God, for ble&s;&s;ing his Weapons with the Death of his Brother; and then you have a Picture in <HI>Little</HI> of the great Piety, that begins and ends the Wars all over heavenly Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>What Blindne&s;s can well be greater, than to think that a Chri&s;tian Kingdom, as &s;uch, can have any other Goodne&s;s, or Union with Chri&s;t, but that very Good|ne&s;s, which makes the private Chri&s;tian to be one with

him, and a Partaker of the divine Nature?

<P>Look at that which the private Chri&s;tian is to do to his Neighbour, or his Enemy, and you &s;ee that very Thing, which one Chri&s;tian Kingdom is to do to ano|ther. Look at that which proves a Man to be not led and governed by the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and you &s;ee that, which proves a Kingdom to be under the Dominion and Power of Satan.&mdash;Wherever <HI>Pride</HI> is, there the De|vil is riding in his fir&s;t fiery Chariot; and wherever <HI>Wrath</HI> is, there he has his fir&s;t murdering Sword at Work.&mdash;What is it, that fallen Man wants to be re|deemed from, but Pride and Wrath, Envy and Covet|uo&s;ne&s;s? He can have no higher Separation, or Apo&s;ta&s;y from God, no fuller Union with Satan and his Angels, than he has of the Spirit of the&s;e Tempers: They con|&s;titute that, which whether you call it SELF, or <HI>Satan</HI> in him, the Meaning is the &s;ame.

<P>Love, Goodne&s;s, and Communication of Good, is the immutable Glory and Perfection of the divine Na|ture, and nothing can have Union with God, but that which partakes of <HI>this</HI> Goodne&s;s.&mdash;The Love that brought forth the Exi&s;tence of all Things, changes not

<P>To prevent all this, and make thee a Child of the fir&s;t Re&s;urrection, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, God and Man, the only be|gotton Son of his infinite Love, came into the World in the Name, and under the Character of infinite <HI>Pity,</HI> boundle&s;s <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> inexpre&s;&s;ible <HI>Meekne&s;s,</HI> bleeding <HI>Love,</HI> namele&s;s <HI>Humility,</HI> never ending <HI>Patience, long Suf|fering,</HI> and Bowels of redeeming <HI>Mercy,</HI> called the Lamb of God, who with all the&s;e &s;upernatural Virtues taketh away the Sins of the World.</P>
<P>Now from this View of God's infinite Love and Mer|cy in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, willing nothing, &s;eeking nothing through all the Regions of his Providence, but that Sinners of all Kinds, the bolde&s;t Rebels again&s;t all his Goodne&s;s, may have their <HI>proper</HI> Remedy, their <HI>nece&s;|&s;ary</HI> Means of being fully delivered from all that <HI>Hurt, Mi&s;chief</HI> and <HI>De&s;truction,</HI> which in full Oppo&s;ition to their God and Creator, they had brought upon them|&s;elves; from this View, I &s;ay, of God and Chri&s;t, u&s;ing every Miracle of Love and Wi&s;dom, to give recovery of Life, Health, and Salvation to all that have rebelled again&s;t them, look at the <HI>murdering Mon&s;ter</HI> of WAR.

<P>Among&s;t unfallen Creatures in Heaven, God's Name and Nature, is LOVE, LIGHT, and GLORY.&mdash; To the fallen Sons of Adam, that which was <HI>Love, Light,</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> in Heaven, becomes infinite PITY and COMPASSION on Earth, in a God, clothed with

the Nature of his fallen Creature, bearing all its In|firmities, entering into all its Troubles, and in the meek Innocence of a Lamb of God, living a Life, and dying a Death, of all the Sufferings due to Sin.&mdash;Hence it was, that when this DIVINE PITY &s;uffered its own life-giving Blood to be poured on the Ground, all out|ward Nature made full Declaration of its attoning, and redeeming Power; the Strength of the Earth did quake, the Hardne&s;s of Rocks was forced to Split, and long covered Graves to give up their Dead.&mdash;</P>
<P>Sing, O ye Heavens, and Shout all ye lower Parts of the Earth, for this is OUR GOD that varies not, who&s;e fir&s;t <HI>creating Love</HI> knows no Change, but into a <HI>redeem|ing Pity</HI> towards all his fallen Creatures.</P>
<P>Look now at <HI>warring Chri&s;tendom,</HI> what &s;malle&s;t Drop of Pity towards Sinners is to be found in it? Or how could a Spirit all Helli&s;h, more fully contrive and ha&s;ten their De&s;truction?&mdash;It &s;tirs up and kindles every Pa&s;|&s;ion of fallen Nature, that is contrary to the all-humble, all-meek, all-loving, all-forgiving, all-&s;aving Spirit of Chri&s;t.&mdash;It unites, it drives, and compels namele&s;s Numbers of unconverted Sinners to fall, murdering and murdered among&s;t Fla&s;hes of Fire, with the Wrath and Swiftne&s;s of Lightning, into a Fire infinitely wor&s;e than that in which they died.&mdash;O &s;ad Subject for Thank&s;giving Days, whether in Popi&s;h, or Prote&s;tant Churches!

<P>Here now, let the <HI>Wi&s;dom of this world</HI> be as Wi&s;e as ever it will, and from its learned Throne condemn all this as <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI>; it need be no Trouble to any one, to be condemned by that Wi&s;dom, which God him&s;elf hath condemned <HI>as Fooli&s;hne&s;s with him.</HI> For the Wi&s;|dom of this World hath all the Contrariety to <HI>Salvation-wi&s;dom,</HI> that the Fle&s;h hath to the Spirit, Earth to Hea|ven, or Damnation to Salvation.

<P>This Que&s;tion is &s;o far from needing to be an&s;wered <HI>by me,</HI> that it is wholly on <HI>my Side;</HI> it confe&s;&s;es all, and proves all that I have &s;aid of the fallen State of Chri&s;ten|dom, to be &s;trictly true.&mdash;For if this is the governing Spirit of Chri&s;tian Kingdoms, that no one of them can &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Safety from its neighbouring Chri&s;tian King|doms, but by its Weapons of War, are not all Chri&s;tian Kingdoms equally in the &s;ame <HI>unchri&s;tian</HI> State, as two neighbouring <HI>bloody Knaves,</HI> who cannot be &s;afe from one another, but as each others murdering Arms pre|&s;erve and protect them? This Plea therefore for Chri&s;|tendom's Wars, proves nothing el&s;e but the want of Chri&s;tianity all over the Chri&s;tian World, and &s;tands upon no better a Foundation of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Goodne&s;s, than when one Murdering Knave kills ano|ther, that would have killed him.</P>
<P>But to know whether Chri&s;tianity wants, or admits of War, Chri&s;tianity is to be con&s;idered as in its right State.&mdash;Now the true State of the World turned Chri&s;tian, is thus de&s;cribed by the great Go&s;pel prophet, who &s;hewed what a Change it was to make in the fallen State of the World.&mdash;It &s;hall come to pa&s;s, &s;aith he, <HI>in the la&s;t Days,</HI> that is, in the Days of Chri&s;tendom, <HI>that the Mountain of the Lord's Hou&s;e</HI> (his Chri&s;tian King|dom) <HI>&s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Top of the Mountains, and all Nations &s;hall flow into it; and many People &s;hall &s;ay, let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord's Hou&s;e, and he will teach us of his Ways, and we will walk in his Paths,</HI> I&s;aiah ii. 2.</P>
<P>Now what follows from this going up of the Nations to the Mountain of the Lord's Hou&s;e, from his teach|ing them of his Ways, and their walking in his Paths? The holy Prophet expre&s;sly tells you in his following
<PB N="117" REF="019755_0127_0FACACD8E32BCCA8">
Words, <HI>They &s;hall beat their Swords into Plow-&s;hares, and their Spears into pruning Hooks: Nation &s;hall not lift up its Sword again&s;t Nation,</HI> (N. B.) <HI>neither &s;hall they learn War any more.</HI>&mdash;This is the Prophet's true Chri&s;|tendom, with one and the &s;ame e&s;&s;ential divine Mark &s;et upon it, as when the Lamb of God &s;aid, <HI>By this</HI> &s;hall all Men <HI>know,</HI> that ye are my Di&s;ciples, <HI>if ye Love ano|ther as I have loved you.</HI>&mdash;Chri&s;t's Kingdom of God is no where come, but where the Works of the Devil are de&s;troyed, and Men are turned from the Power of Satan unto God.&mdash;God is only another Name for the highe&s;t and only Good; and the highe&s;t and only Good, means nothing el&s;e but LOVE with all its WORKS. &mdash;Satan is only another Name for the <HI>Whole</HI> and <HI>all</HI> of Evil, and the whole of Evil is nothing el&s;e but its whole <HI>Contrariety</HI> to Love.&mdash;And the Sum total of all <HI>Contrariety</HI> to Love, is contained in Pride, Wrath, Strife, Self, Envy, Hatred, Revenge, Mi&s;chief, and Mur|der. Look at the&s;e, with all their Fruits that belong to them, and then you &s;ee all the <HI>princely Power,</HI> that Sa|tan is, and has in this fallen World.</P>
<P>Would you &s;ee when and where the Kingdoms of this fallen World are become a Kingdom of God, the go&s;|pel Prophet tells you, that it is <HI>then</HI> and <HI>there</HI> where all Enmity cea&s;eth.&mdash;<HI>The Wolf,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>&s;hall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard &s;hall lie down with the Kid. The Calf and the young Lion and the Fatling together, and a little Child &s;hall lead them. The Cow and the Bear &s;hall feed, and their young ones &s;hall lie down together, and the Lion &s;hall eat Straw like the Ox. The &s;ucking Child &s;hall play on the Hole of the A&s;p, and the weaned Child &s;hall put his Hand on the Cockatrice's Den.</HI>&mdash;For, N.

of Enmity changed into one united Power of Heavenly Love.&mdash;But ob&s;erve again and again, whence this comes to pa&s;s, that God's Kingdom on Earth is, and can be nothing el&s;e, but the Power of reigning Love; the Prophet tells you, it is becau&s;e in the Day of his Kingdom, <HI>the Earth &s;hall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea.</HI>&mdash;Therefore, O Chri&s;tendom, thy <HI>Wars</HI> are thy certain <HI>Proof,</HI> that thou art all over as full of an Ignorance of God, as the Wa|ters cover the Sea.</P>
<P>As to the pre&s;ent fallen State of univer&s;al Chri&s;ten|dom, working under the Spirit and Power of the great fiery Dragon, it is not my Intention, in any Thing I am here upon, to &s;hew how any Part of it can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, or pre&s;erve it&s;elf from being devoured by every other Part, but by its own Dragon Weapons.</P>
<P>But the Chri&s;tendom which I mean, that neither wants, nor allows of War, is only that where Chri&s;t is King, and his Holy Spirit the only Governor of the Wills, Affections, and De&s;igns of all that belong to it. &mdash;It is my Complaint again&s;t, and Charge upon all the Nations of Chri&s;tendom, that this Nece&s;&s;ity of mur|dering Arms, is the Dragon's <HI>Mon&s;ter,</HI> that is equally brought forth by all and every Part of fallen Chri&s;ten|dom; and that therefore all and every Part, as well Po|pi&s;h as Prote&s;tant, are at one and the &s;ame Di&s;tance from the Spirit of their Lord and Saviour the Lamb of God, and therefore all want one and the &s;ame entire Reformation.</P>
<P>In the&s;e la&s;t Ages of fallen Chri&s;tendom, many Re|formations have taken Place; but alas! Truth mu&s;t be forced to &s;ay, that they have been in all their Variety, little better than &s;o many run-away Births of one and the &s;ame Mother, &s;o many le&s;&s;er <HI>Babels</HI> come out of <HI>Babylon</HI> the great&mdash;For among&s;t all the Reformers, the one only true Reformation hath never yet been thought of.&mdash;A Change or Place, of Governors, of Opinions,

together with new formed, outward Models, is all the Reformation that has yet been attempted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of this World, with its worldly Spirit, was the only Thing that had overcome the Church, and had carried it into Captivity. For in Captivity it cer|tainly is, as &s;oon as it is turned into a Kingdom of this World; and a Kingdom of this World it certainly is, as &s;oon as worldly Wi&s;dom has its Power in it.&mdash;Not a fal&s;e Doctrine, not a bad Di&s;cipline, not an u&s;urped Power, or corrupt Practice ever has prevailed, or does prevail in the Church, but has had its whole Birth and Growth from worldly Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>This Wi&s;dom, was the great evil Root, at which the reforming Axe &s;hould have been laid, and mu&s;t be laid, before the Church can be again that Virgin Spou&s;e of Chri&s;t, which it was at the Beginning.&mdash;<HI>If any Man,</HI> &s;aith St. <HI>Paul, will be wi&s;e, let him become a Fool in this World.</HI> This admits of no Exception, it is a Maxim as univer&s;al, and unalterable, as that which &s;aith, <HI>If any Man will follow Chri&s;t, let him deny him&s;elf.</HI>&mdash;For no Man has any more to deny than that, which the Wi&s;dom and Spirit of this World are, and do in him. For all that is in this World, the <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> of the Fle&s;h, the Lu&s;t of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, are the very Things, in which alone the Wi&s;dom of this World lives, and moves, and has its being. It can be no other, can ri&s;e no higher, nor be any better, than they are, and do.&mdash; For as heavenly Wi&s;dom, is the Whole of all heavenly Goodne&s;s, &s;o earthly Wi&s;dom has the Whole Evil of all the earthly Nature.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of a <HI>natural Man, that cannot know the Things of God,</HI> but to whom they are mere <HI>Fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI> This <HI>natural Man,</HI> is only another Name for the Wi&s;|dom of this World; but though he cannot know the Things that be of God, yet he can know their <HI>Names,</HI> and learn to &s;peak that, which the Saints of God have &s;poken about them.&mdash;He can make Profe&s;&s;ion of them, be eloquent in their Prai&s;e, and &s;et them forth in &s;uch
<PB N="120" REF="019755_0130_0FACACDAE4D84BF8">
a de&s;irable View, as &s;hall make them quite agreeable to the Children of worldly Wi&s;dom.&mdash;This is the natural Man, who having got into the Church, and Church Power, has turned the Things of God into Things of this World.&mdash;Had this Man been kept out of the Church, the Church had kept its fir&s;t Purity to this Day; for its fallen State is nothing el&s;e, but its Fall into the Hands of the natural Man of this World.&mdash;And when this is the State of the Church, the Wi&s;dom of this World (which always loves its own) will be in Love with it, will &s;pare no Co&s;t to maintain it, will make Laws, fight Battles in Defence of it, and condemn eve|ry Man as Heretical, who dares &s;peak a Word again&s;t this <HI>glorious Image</HI> of a Church, which the Wi&s;dom of this World has &s;et up.</P>
<P>This is the great Antichri&s;t, which is neither better nor wor&s;e, nor any Thing el&s;e, but the Spirit of Satan working again&s;t Chri&s;t, in the Strength and Subtlety of earthly Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>If therefore you take any Thing to be Church-reform|ation, but a full Departure from the Wi&s;dom of this World, or any Thing to be your Entrance into a Sal|vation-church, but the <HI>Nature, Spirit,</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> of Chri&s;t, become <HI>living</HI> in you, then, whether Papi&s;t, or Prote&s;tant, Reformation or no Reformation, all will be ju&s;t as much Good to you, as when a Sadducee turns Publican, or from a Publican becomes a Phari&s;ee.&mdash;For the Church of Chri&s;t, as it is the <HI>Door</HI> of Salvation, is nothing el&s;e but Chri&s;t him&s;elf.&mdash;Chri&s;t in us, or we in his Church, is the &s;ame Thing. When that is <HI>alive, wills and works</HI> in you, which was alive in Chri&s;t, then you are in his Church; for that which he was, that mu&s;t they be, who are his. Without this, it matters not what <HI>Pale</HI> you are in. To every Thing but the new Creature, Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>I know you not</HI>; and to every Virtue, that worldly Wi&s;dom puts on, <HI>Get thee behind me Satan, for thou &s;avoure&s;t not the Things that be of God.</HI> And the Rea&s;on why it mu&s;t be thus, why worldly Wi&s;|dom,
<PB N="121" REF="019755_0131_0FACACDBA4191AA8">
though under a religious Form, is, and can be nothing el&s;e, but that which is called Satan, or Anti-chri&s;t, is becau&s;e all that we are, and have from this World, is that very Enmity again&s;t God, that whole Evil which &s;eparates us from him, and con&s;titutes all that Death and Damnation that belongs to our fallen State.&mdash;And &s;o &s;ure, as the Life of this World is our Separation from God, &s;o &s;ure is it, that a total Depart|ure from every Subtlety and Pro&s;perity of worldly Wi&s;|dom, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to change an evil Son of Adam, into a holy Son of God.&mdash;And here it is well to be ob&s;erved, that the Church of Chri&s;t is &s;olely for this End, to make us Holy as he is Holy. But nothing can do this, but that which hath full Power to change a Sinner into a Saint. And he who has not found <HI>that Power</HI> in the Church, may be a&s;&s;ured, that he is not yet a true Son of that Church. For the Church brings forth no other Births, but holy Children of God; it has no other End, no other Nature, or Work, but that of changing a Sinner into a Saint.&mdash;But this can only be done, ju&s;t as the Change of Night into Day is done, or as the Darkne&s;s is quite lo&s;t in the Light.&mdash;Some|thing as contrary to the whole Nature of Sin, as Light is to Darkne&s;s, and as powerful over it, as the Light is powerful over Darkne&s;s, can alone do this.&mdash;Creeds, Cannons, Articles of Religion, &s;tately Churches, learn|ed Prie&s;ts, Singing, Preaching, and Praying in the be&s;t contrived Form of Words, can no more rai&s;e a dead Sinner into a living Saint, than a <HI>fine Sy&s;tem</HI> of Light and Colours can change the Night into Day. For, (N. B.) that which cannot help you to <HI>all</HI> Goodne&s;s, cannot help you to <HI>any</HI> Goodne&s;s, nor can that take away <HI>any</HI> Sin, but that which can take away <HI>all</HI> Sin.</P>
<P>On this Ground it is, that the Apo&s;tle &s;aid, <HI>Circum|ci&s;ion is nothing, and Uncircumci&s;ion is nothing;</HI> and on the &s;ame Ground it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that <HI>Popery</HI> is nothing, and <HI>Prote&s;tanei&s;m</HI> is nothing, becau&s;e all is nothing, as to Salvation, but a Sinner changed into a Saint, or the

Apo&s;tle's new Creature.&mdash;Call nothing therefore your holy, Salvation-church, but that which taketh away all your Sins; this is the only Way not to be deceived with the Cry about Churches, Reformations, and Divi&s;ions. &mdash;If it be a&s;ked, what is meant by taking away all our Sins, the Whole is fully told us in the&s;e Words, <HI>To as many as believed, to them he gave Power to become Sons of God.</HI> This is the true taking away, or Forgivene&s;s of Sins; not a &s;trong Imagination, or Brain-fancy, that on &s;uch an Hour, on &s;uch a Day, or in &s;uch a Place, you felt and knew a&s;&s;uredly that all your Sins were forgiven you: By &s;uch a Forgivene&s;s of Sins, <HI>that</HI> which made you a Sinner is not <HI>de&s;troyed,</HI> but you will have every Day the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity or confe&s;&s;ing your&s;elf a <HI>mi&s;erable Sinner,</HI> as you had that <HI>Morning,</HI> when your Sins were not forgiven you till the <HI>Afternoon.</HI>&mdash;The true Forgive|ne&s;s of Sins, is only then, when <HI>that</HI> which &s;inned in us is done away, or become powerle&s;s in us; but no|thing can do this, but <HI>that Power</HI> by which we become Sons of God.&mdash;A blind Man has then only a Deliver|ance from his Blindne&s;s, when he is put in full Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of &s;eeing Eyes; this is the only doing away of his Darkne&s;s.&mdash;Ju&s;t &s;o, and no otherwi&s;e, are our Sins forgiven us, or done away, when the Power by which we become Sons of God, or the new Creature, is &s;o given to us, &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by us, as &s;eeing Eyes are given to, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Man, who before that was all Blindne&s;s.&mdash;And as our <HI>old Man,</HI> can only then be &s;aid to be truly <HI>put off,</HI> when the <HI>new Man</HI> in Chri&s;t, is rai&s;|ed to Life in his Stead, &s;o our Sins are only then truly blotted out, or done away, when an un&s;inning Nature, or a Birth of God, that &s;inneth not, is come to be the ruling Life in us.</P>
<P>Many are the <HI>Marks,</HI> which the learned have given us of the true Church; but be that as it will, no Man, whether learned or unlearned, can have any Mark or Proof of his own <HI>true Church-member&s;hip,</HI> but his being dead unto all Sin, and alive unto all Righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;
<PB N="123" REF="019755_0133_0FACACDD21E2BE60">
This cannot be more plainly told us, than in the&s;e Words of our Lord, <HI>He that committeth Sin, is the Ser|vant of Sin;</HI> but &s;urely that Servant of Sin, cannot at the &s;ame Time be a living Member of Chri&s;t's Body, or that new Creature, who dwelleth in Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t in him.&mdash;To &s;uppo&s;e a Man born again from above, yet under a nece&s;&s;ity of continuing to Sin, is as ab&s;urd as to &s;uppo&s;e, that the true Chri&s;tian is only to have &s;o much of the Nature of Chri&s;t born in him, as is con&s;i&s;tent with as real a Power of Satan &s;till dwelling in him.&mdash;<HI>If the Son,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>&s;hall make you free, then ye &s;hall be free indeed.</HI> What is this, but &s;aying, if Chri&s;t become to Life in you, then a true Freedom from all Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning is given to you. Now if this is hindered, and cannot come to pa&s;s in the faithful Follower of Chri&s;t, it mu&s;t be, becau&s;e both the will|ing and working of Chri&s;t in Man, is too weak to over|come that, which the Devil willeth and worketh in him. &mdash;All this Ab&s;urdity, and even Bla&s;phemy, is nece&s;&s;a|rily implied in that common Doctrine of Books and Pulpits, which teaches, that the Chri&s;tian can never have done &s;inning, as long as he lives.&mdash;Well therefore may Chri&s;tendom &s;leep as &s;ecurely as it does, under the Power of Sin, without any Thought, Hope, or De|&s;ire of doing God's Will on Earth, as it is done in Heaven; without any concern at their not being pure, as he who hath called them is pure, or walking as he walked.</P>
<P>The Scripture knows no Chri&s;tians, but Saints, who in all Things act as becometh Saints. But now if the Scripture Saint did not mean a Man, that e&s;chewed <HI>all Evil,</HI> and was holy in all his Conver&s;ation, Saint and no Saint, would have only &s;uch Difference, as one car|nal Man will always have from another.&mdash;Preachers and Writers comfort the half Chri&s;tians with telling them, that God <HI>requireth not</HI> a perfect, &s;inle&s;s Obedi|ence, but <HI>accepteth</HI> the Sincerity of our weak Endea|vours in&s;tead of it.&mdash;Here if ever, the <HI>Blind lead the

<P>The Pleader for Imperfection, farther &s;upports him|&s;elf by &s;aying, no Man in the World, Chri&s;t excepted, was ever without Sin.&mdash;And &s;o &s;ay I too; and with the Apo&s;tle I al&s;o add, <HI>That if we &s;ay we have not &s;inned, we make him a Liar.</HI>&mdash;But then it is as true to &s;ay,

Truth enough! And the very &s;ame Truth, as when the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>The natural Man knoweth not the Things that be of God, he cannot know them, they are fooli&s;hne&s;s to him.</HI> This is the Man, that we all are by Nature.&mdash;But what Scripture ever &s;poke of, or required any perfect Works from this Man, any more than it requires the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> to change his Skin?

<P>Whence now comes all this Folly of Doctrines?

And therefore all the Frailties, Follies, and Imper|fections of human Nature, mu&s;t have as much Life in the Church, as in any other human Society. And the be&s;t Sons of &s;uch a Church, mu&s;t be forced to plead &s;uch Im|perfections in the Members of it, as mu&s;t be, where the old fallen human Nature is &s;till alive.&mdash;And alive it there mu&s;t be, and its Life defended, where, the being <HI>con|tinually moved, and led</HI> by the Spirit of God, is rejected as gro&s;s Enthu&s;ia&s;m.&mdash;For nothing but a full Birth, and continual Breathing and In&s;piration of the Holy Spirit in the new born Creature, can be a Deliverance from all that, which is earthly, &s;en&s;ual, and devili&s;h in our fallen Nature.&mdash;This New Creature, born again in Chri&s;t, of that ETERNAL WORD, which created all Things in Heaven and on Earth, is both the <HI>Rock</HI> and <HI>Church,</HI> of which Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>The Gates of Hell never prevail again&s;t it.</HI>&mdash;For prevail they will, and mu&s;t
