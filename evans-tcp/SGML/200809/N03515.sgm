<P>And, my Friends, be thoroughly awa|kened, to con&s;ider about the Affairs of your precious immortal Souls. Be not like them that &s;leep as on the Top of a Ma&s;t in the mid&s;t of the Sea, al|ways ready to roll off and drop down into everla&s;ting Burnings, but keep in Mind the awful Demand of our Saviour, <HI>What is a Man profitted if he &s;hall gain the whole World and lo&s;e his own Soul.</HI> Frequently and &s;olemnly renew the Dedication of your &s;elves unto the Lord, and often examine how Things are between God and your own Souls, and pray always with all Prayer, both

Keep al|ways in the Love and Fear of God; and realize to your &s;elves, that the Lord &s;ees you every where.

Who more than Sailors and Soldiers, do carry their Lives in their Hands? Therefore they need the Prayers, the Cares, the Helps, and the be&s;t Endeavours of all their Friends for their Good.

<P>And I wi&s;h that tho&s;e young Men that might live at Home comfortably would con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, whether the Enemy of their Souls may not be driving them, when they are mightily hurried, to run away to Sea. Does

Yea, God him&s;elf will be your Portion, Shield, and exceed|ing great Reward. And then nothing &s;hall be wanting that is good for you, for God is all in all. Are you weak? He is Strength. Poor? He is Riches. In Trouble? He is Comfort. Sick? He is Health. Dying? He is Life. Have you nothing? He is all Things. What&s;oever is &s;uitable to your Nature, or convenient for you in every Condi|tion of Life, that God is.

God, it's true, as to his E&s;&s;ence, is ubiquitary; and his Providence is e|qually exten&s;ive with his Works of Cre|ation.

<P>MOSES, the Captain General and Governour in Chief, of the Congrega|tion of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> was (no doubt) &s;en&s;ible of the va&s;t Con&s;equence of the Divine Pre&s;ence with a Per&s;on or People in the common Concerns of Life, much more in Enterprizes peculiarly hazard|ous, &s;uch as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that of their pa&s;&s;ing thro' an howling Wilderne&s;s, and taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> (tho' promi&s;ed) again&s;t the united Force of many and mighty Enemies.

Body or Society of Men, even in the mo&s;t common Concerns of Life; but e&s;pecially in Enterprizes, attended with any peculiar Hazard and Danger.

<P>Indeed the Ca&s;e of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in our Text and Contex was extraordinary; he had therefore the greater Rea&s;on to be &s;olicitou&s;ly concerned in engaging the Divine Pre&s;ence and Favour with him|&s;elf and People. Neverthele&s;s, &s;ince the Pre&s;ence md Favour of God, and that only, can make every Circum&s;tance of Life plea&s;ant and profitable and fill our Sails with the refre&s;hing Gales of Pro&s;perity, in tho&s;e various Enerpri&s;es wherein we embarque in this pre&s;ent World of mutability, therefore both Dury and Intere&s;t, if we are not forgetfull of our God and &s;elves, will certainly fill us with an earne&s;t Concern for the enjoy|ment of God's Pre&s;ence in all our un|dertakings, hightened in proportion to the Hazard and Difficulty attending tho&s;e Enterprizes we are engaged in.</P>

<P>Wherefore, let tho&s;e that are going from us, to do Bu&s;ine&s;s upon the great Deeps, be prevailed with, to make it their great Concern, to get God to go along with them, in a Way of Mercy, Grace and Favour.</P>

The Awe of &s;uch fre&s;h and re|peated Dedications of your &s;elves to God and his Service, if duely performed, will have a very powerful Re&s;traint upon you to keep you from Sin, and be a mighty Incentive to Duty.</P>
<P N="3">3. At all Times, maintain a realizing Belief, of the all-&s;eeing Eye of your great Judge, which is always upon you. A firm Belief of the Divine Omni&s;cience, in order to future Judgment, would certainly have a mighty Awe upon our Spirits, not only to make us &s;erious and diligent in Duty, but watchful again&s;t Temptation. <HI>Beer-lahai roi,</HI> The Name which <HI>Hagar</HI> gave to the <HI>Well,</HI> where God appeared unto her, <HI>Gen.</HI> 16. 14. was much to the Purpo&s;e: It &s;ignifying, <HI>The Well of him that lives and &s;ees me</HI>: For &s;he &s;aid, Ver&s;. 13.&mdash;<HI>Thou God &s;ee&s;t me.</HI> This certainly would be a very &s;ea&s;onable and &s;erviceabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Tho't, when we are entring into Duty or a&s;&s;aulted

Will a Man venture to break the Law in open Court, or affront the Judge to his Face?</P>
<P N="4">4. Exerci&s;e your Tho'ts much upon &s;uch Subjects as may have a Tendency to take away the Force of tho&s;e Temp|tations, you do, or are mo&s;t likely to meet with. Such you may meet with abroad in the World, as will endeavour not only to draw you into the Ways of Vice and Wickedne&s;s, by the plea&s;ant Baits of Plea&s;ure and Profit; but to fright or banter you out of all Virtue, Religion and Goodne&s;s, by their angry or reproachful Treatment: But let none of the&s;e Things which you may meet with, move you from the Line of Duty. Are you reproached and abu&s;ed by vile Men because you refu&s;e to run into the &s;ame exce&s;s of Riot with others?

<P>Whereas, on the other Hand, if you are banter'd out of your Innocency, and frighted into a mean and &s;ervile Com|pliance with the vicious Humours, and wicked Practices of Others, you may expect to be filled with very unea&s;ie Re&s;lections upon your &s;elves, at the be&s;t, to have your Hearts broken with the Sorrows of Repentance, otherwi&s;e, to be eternally reproached, affrighted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with whole Armies of errors in the Place of the Damned, under the the dreadful Impre&s;&s;ions of the Wrath of God. And as to the Plea&s;ures and Profits of the World, are they pre&s;ented to you, in the mo&s;t en|gaging Appearance, to corrupt your fi|dility and tempt your from your Duty, con&s;ider, that by a ba&s;e Compliance

<P N="5">5. Have your Hearts ever lifted up to God for Grace and Srength to with|&s;tand, re&s;i&s;t and overcome Temptation.
