<Q><BIBL>ISAIAH LV. Ver. 12.</BIBL>
<P>Ye &s;hall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills &s;hall break forth before you into &s;inging, and all the trees of the field &s;hall clap their hands.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN ancient predictions of glory to the righteous are contemplated, the habit of beholding the impiety and infamy of the world, greatly dimini&s;hes the rapture they are de&s;igned to in&s;pire. We regard the excellent events they foretel, as objects of de&s;ire, rather than objects of expectation; and, though the faithfulne&s;s of the divine te&s;timonies &s;uffer not our langui&s;hing faith to expire, when we contra&s;t <HI>times</HI> with <HI>prophecies,</HI> we are led to place the period of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s at a di&s;tance far remote.</P>
<P>But let us hope that more diligent attention will furni&s;h ideas more encouraging.</P>
<P>It is true, that though the knowledge of the Lord &s;hall cover the earth, men are peri&s;hing for <HI>lack</HI> of knowledge: having the under&s;tanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, becau&s;e of the blindne&s;s of their hearts.</P>
<P>It is true, the depraved pa&s;&s;ions of the human &s;oul are every where revealed. Iniquitous policy and mad ambition controul the actions of nations. The banners of war are unfurled;&mdash;fleets on the ocean, armies on the &s;hores are meditating and at each other projecting de&s;truction. In the private circles
<PB N="6" REF="034599_0003_0FFF1133E659A850">
of life, uncleanne&s;s and inebriation prevail. The God of heaven is bla&s;phemed, his &s;ervants are pitied or de&s;pi&s;ed, his holy oracle is trampled under foot, and the great principles of piety, like tares in the harve&s;t field, are declared pernicious, and indu&s;triou&s;ly rooted up.</P>
<P>It is true, mi&s;ery is every where di&s;cernible. Di&s;ea&s;es generated by crimes are con&s;uming the bodies of thou&s;ands, and a convicted con&s;cience cha&s;ti&s;ing their &s;pirits. The depopulations of pe&s;ti|lence are &s;een, are heard of, and widows and orphans, moving over fields of &s;laughter or to dwellings of poverty, are rai&s;ing their piteous lamentations.</P>
<P>It is true,&mdash;but, why &s;hould we amplify this afflicting detail? Though we continue to &s;hroud mankind in darkne&s;s and guilt till de&s;truction and death &s;ay "it is enough," we mu&s;t even then remember, that the mea&s;ures of Providence are not controllable by the offences and calamities of men; that the lu&s;tre of prophetic truth cannot be concealed, and that in the fulfilment of prophecy, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t darkne&s;s has frequently preceded the mo&s;t marvellous light.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions we are about illu&s;trating this animating prediction,
<Q>Ye &s;hall go out with joy and be led forth with peace, the mountains and hills &s;hall break forth before you into &s;inging, and all the trees of the field &s;hall clap <HI>their</HI> hands.</Q></P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age appears to have been written about the clo&s;e of the reign of Hezekiah. Prophecies had been delivered foretelling the certain and impending di&s;&s;olution of the hou&s;e of David and the captivity of the people. After Hezekiah's recovery from &s;ickne&s;s, the king of Babylon &s;ent to him letters and a pre&s;ent.&mdash;Letters perhaps to make the king of Judah his ally in his meditated revolt from the king of A&s;&s;yria, and a pre&s;ent or offering expre&s;&s;ive of his veneration for a per&s;on, the &s;ign of who&s;e recovery was the going backward of that &s;un, he
<PB N="7" REF="034599_0004_0FFF1137318EF748">
had been accu&s;tomed to adore as the &s;overeign deity! Hezekiah, left of his God to the vanity of his heart, as though eager to prove him&s;elf a de&s;irable confederate and a proper &s;ubject of the honours he had received from the heavens, &s;hews to the me&s;&s;engers of the &s;on of Baladan
<Q>the hou&s;e of his precious things, the &s;ilver, the gold and the &s;pices, and the ointment, and all the hou&s;e of his armour, and all that was found in his trea&s;ures: there was nothing in his hou&s;e nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah &s;hewed them not.</Q></P>
<P>But immediately after this circum&s;tance Jehovah made manife&s;t the folly of the prince, by foretelling the fate of the people. Then &s;aid I&s;aiah to Heze|kiah,
<Q>Behold the days come, that all that <HI>is</HI> in thine hou&s;e, and <HI>that</HI> which thy fathers have laid up in &s;tore until this day, &s;hall be carried to Babylon: nothing &s;hall be left, &s;aith the Lord.</Q>
To Mana&s;&s;eh the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Hezekiah the Lord &s;pake by his &s;ervants the prophets, &s;aying,
<Q>I will for&s;ake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they &s;hall become a prey and a &s;poil to all their enemies.</Q></P>
<P>But in wrath he remembers mercy. Not more clearly is the captivity of Judah foretold than her glorious deliverance; not more, her &s;in than her repentance, her tran&s;ient di&s;grace than her perma|nent honour. Yes, ye children of Judah, from <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> ye &s;hall go out with weeping and be led forth as pri&s;oners of war; the mountains &s;hall mourn, the hills &s;hall tremble, and the trees of the fore&s;t &s;hall howl in &s;ympathetic woe; but, yet, from <HI>Babylon,</HI> ye &s;hall go out with joy and be led forth with peace, the mountains and the hills &s;hall break forth before you into &s;inging, and all the trees of the field &s;hall clap their hands.</P>
<P>The prophet foretels a variety of events which were to attend Judah's re&s;toration, well calculated to
<PB N="8" REF="034599_0005_0FFF1138E4596F68">
awaken tran&s;port. See yonder the welcome amba&s;|&s;ador! How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publi&s;heth peace;&mdash;that &s;aith unto Zion, thy God reigneth! Hark! The voice of him that crieth in the wilderne&s;s, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make &s;traight in the de&s;ert a high-way for our God.</P>
<P>Hear the language of Jehovah, he &s;peaks to <HI>the deep</HI>&mdash;"Be dry, and I will dry up the rivers to <HI>Cyrus.</HI> I will go before thee, and make the crooked places &s;traight: and I will break in pieces the gates of bra&s;s and cut a&s;under the bars of iron. For Jacob my &s;ervant's &s;ake, and I&s;rael mine elect, I have called thee by thy name.</P>
<P>To <HI>the heavens</HI> and <HI>earth.</HI> "Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the &s;kies pour down righteou&s;|ne&s;s; let the earth open and let them bring forth &s;alvation."</P>
<P>To <HI>Zion in affliction.</HI> "Awake, awake; put on thy &s;trength O Zion, put on thy beautiful garments, O Jeru&s;alem; &s;hake thy&s;elf from the du&s;t, ari&s;e, loo&s;e thy&s;elf from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter. No weapon that is formed again&s;t thee &s;hall pro&s;per; and every tongue that &s;hall ri&s;e again&s;t thee in judgment thou &s;halt condemn."</P>
<P>But is this word of Jehovah firm? It is firm as the ordinances of heaven, it is firmer than the moun|tains of the earth. "For this is as the waters of Noah unto me; for as I have &s;worn that the waters of Noah &s;hould no more go over the earth; &s;o have I &s;worn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. The mountains &s;hall depart and the hills be removed, but my kindne&s;s &s;hall not depart from thee, neither &s;hall the covenant of my peace be removed, &s;aith the Lord, that hath mercy on thee."</P>
<P>Are the expectations of &s;o great a deliverance rea&s;onable? They are rea&s;onable as the expectation of the ri&s;ing of vegetation under the influence of protecting &s;nows and refre&s;hing rains. "For as the
<PB N="9" REF="034599_0006_0FFF113C116C0D70">
rain cometh down and the &s;now from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give &s;eed to the &s;ower and bread to the eater: &s;o &s;hall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it &s;hall not return unto me void, but it &s;hall accompli&s;h that which I plea&s;e, and it &s;hall pro&s;per <HI>in the thing</HI> whereto I &s;ent it."</P>
<P>It is generally confe&s;&s;ed that the prophecies of the Bible allude to di&s;tinct and di&s;tant periods of time. That while a prophet announces the ruin of the enemies of Jeru&s;alem, the deliverance of Judah, and the ble&s;&s;ings &s;he &s;hould enjoy, he frequently carries forward our reflections to the de&s;truction of every antichri&s;t, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah, and the evangelical and immortal happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ubject of I&s;aiah's prophecy includes in it three di&s;tinct parts. The deliverance of the Jews from the captivity of Babylon; the deliverance of the Gentiles from their mi&s;erable &s;tate of ignorance and idolatry; and the deliverance of mankind from the captivity of &s;in and death. The&s;e three &s;ubjects are &s;ubor|dinate to one another; and the two latter are &s;hadowed out under the image of the former. They are covered by it as by a veil; which however is tran&s;parent and &s;uffers them to appear through it. LOWTH's <HI>Tran&s;lation of I&s;aiah.</HI></NOTE>. Le&s;t the propriety of &s;uch a mode of illu&s;tration &s;hould be di&s;puted, a few ideas &s;hall be &s;ugge&s;ted in its vindication.</P>
<P>The error of re&s;tricting predictions to their imme|diate &s;ubjects, may be proved from their &s;uperiority to the capacity of &s;uch &s;ubjects. For example, of Solomon his in&s;pired parent &s;aid, "In his days &s;hall the righteous flouri&s;h; and abundance of peace &s;o long as the Moon endureth. He &s;hall have dominion al&s;o from &s;ea to &s;ea, and from the river to the ends of the earth. All nations &s;hall &s;erve him. His name &s;hall be continued as long as the &s;un."</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;ert that the dominion of Solomon extended from the lake of Sodom to the Mediterranean &s;ea,
<PB N="10" REF="034599_0007_0FFF113EF654F750">
from the river Euphrates to the borders of Egypt, is to a&s;&s;ign but a mean fulfilment to &s;o grand a prophe&s;y. But what mean the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, "abun|dance of peace &s;o long as the moon endureth&mdash;a name continued as long as the &s;un." Solomon, alas! has &s;lept with his fathers and his very &s;epulchre is no more. At midnight the moon &s;till walks in her brightne&s;s, but war, captivity, and penal retribution have demoli&s;hed the kingdoms of I&s;rael and Judah. In the morning, the &s;un &s;till comes forth as a bride|groom, but the <HI>name</HI> of the &s;on of Bath&s;heba is not known by a thou&s;andth part of the human beings it enlightens. The prophecy mu&s;t be fulfilled&mdash;In Solomon, with all his glory, it cannot. Behold then a greater than Solomon here. It is Je&s;us only, who&s;e name &s;hall endure forever, and whom all nations &s;hall &s;erve; who&s;e dominion is an everla&s;ting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation. What flattery declared of Cae&s;ar, truth a&s;&s;erts of the Me&s;&s;iah. It is he
<Q>who &s;hall terminate his authority by the ocean, his fame by the &s;tars <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Imperium Oceano, famam qui terminet a&s;tris.</P> <BIBL>VIRG.</BIBL></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;criptural application of &s;ome prophe&s;ies to different events and periods, induces us to contem|plate others in the &s;ame light. Of &s;uch an application take the following in&s;tance from Ho&s;ea xi. 1. "Out of Egypt have I called my Son." This text certainly refers to the days of Mo&s;es, when I&s;rael by a &s;ucce&s;|ce&s;&s;ion of miracles was delivered from the tyranny of Pharaoh. It has an allu&s;ion to the days of Ho&s;ea, and &s;eems de&s;igned as a preface to a prediction in in the 5th ver&s;e of the chapter. It alludes to the days of Chri&s;t.
<Q>The angel of the Lord appeareth to Jo&s;eph in a dream &s;aying; Ari&s;e, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for
<PB N="11" REF="034599_0008_0FFF1140844E99A0">
Herod will &s;eek the young child to de&s;troy him.</Q>
Jo&s;eph was there until the death of Herod:
<Q>that it might be fulfilled which was &s;poken of the Lord by the prophet, &s;aying, out of Egypt have I called my &s;on.</Q>
Nor &s;hould I conceive the words at all mi&s;applied, were they produced as illu&s;trative of the calling of &s;inners from the power of Satan to God, or of the church from ob&s;curity to noon-day.</P>
<P>Predictions of this capacious nature are proper both as parts and proofs of a divine revelation. The fulne&s;s they di&s;over, while it a&s;toni&s;hes the faculties, invites the inve&s;tigation of mortals, and proves the pages the production of a mind capable of comprehending at a glance the pa&s;t, the pre&s;ent, and the future.</P>
<P>Such predictions are accommodated to the di&s;po&s;itions of men. Does an infidel que&s;tion the fulfilment of a prophecy? For his plenary conviction, or that he may be left without excu&s;e, its accom|pli&s;hment &s;hall be repeated. Is the impre&s;&s;ion of the importance of a prediction weak on the mind of a Chri&s;tian, becau&s;e fulfilled at a di&s;tant period, or at a di&s;tant place? He &s;hall feel its grandeur, blu&s;h at his error, and give glory to his God, while he beholds it performed in the pre&s;ence of all the nations of the earth. If the prophetic morning &s;tar be di&s;credited, or the day be declared far di&s;tant, the maje&s;tic &s;un &s;hall diffu&s;e univer&s;al conviction and reproof.</P>
<P>In the government of the world, in the progre&s;s of redemption, Jehovah has been pa&s;&s;ing from &s;trength to &s;trength. As the ritual di&s;pen&s;ation was an emblem of evangelical glory, &s;o Jewi&s;h predictions embrace the &s;alvation of Gentiles. The polity of the Jews mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been demoli&s;hed, becau&s;e of its carnality, becau&s;e of its re&s;triction. But how admirable are the mea&s;ures of heaven! Hebrew prophets have been in&s;pired
<PB N="12" REF="034599_0009_0FFF1142283AB0D8">
to foretel that the abundance of the &s;eas &s;hould be converted, and that the forces of the Gentiles &s;hould come. They have been employed to prophecy down the prejudices of their nation, and prepare the way for that glorious mini&s;tration under which there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumci&s;ion nor uncir|cumci&s;ion, Barbarian, Scythian, bond <HI>nor</HI> free: but Chri&s;t <HI>is</HI> all and in all.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations ju&s;tify the application of our text to the times of the go&s;pel, and &s;uch an application may lead us to explain it as illu&s;trative of the influence of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P N="1">I. On Mi&s;&s;ionaries them&s;elves, and</P>
<P N="2">II. On the people to whom their mi&s;&s;ion is directed.</P>
<P>The &s;elected pa&s;&s;age may repre&s;ent the influence of the go&s;pel, in producing in the heart of a Mi&s;&s;ionary zeal, tran&s;port, and tranquillity. "They &s;hall go out with joy and be led forth with peace."</P>
<P>Super&s;tition may &s;end her votaries inactive to her cells; avarice may &s;it in wretched concealment, idly pondering over peri&s;hing bags; indolence and in&s;en&s;ibility may fold the arms for &s;lumber, but Chri&s;tianity is the parent of action. Li&s;ten to its precepts&mdash;"Work out your own &s;alvation with fear and trembling. Gird up the loins of your mind, be &s;ober and hope to the end." Did competitors at Olympic fe&s;tivals, fight, run, wre&s;tle, with all that agony the dread of infamy and the love of renown could in&s;pire? Rival their ardour, fight the good fight of faith, run the race &s;et before you, wre&s;tle with principalities and powers. The world is your theatre of action.</P>
<P>Dimini&s;h its mi&s;eries. Be eyes to the blind, be feet to the lame, clothe the naked, feed the hungry, vi&s;it the impri&s;oned, that the ble&s;&s;ing of him that is ready to peri&s;h may come upon you.</P>
<P>Dimini&s;h its crimes, ye preachers in the &s;anctuary! Ye me&s;&s;engers to the heathen! Prophecy a&s;&s;erts,
<PB N="13" REF="034599_0010_0FFF1144DC6A8558">
ye &s;hall go out with joy, and he, to whom prophets gave witne&s;s, commands your zeal. Our text fore|tels your &s;ucce&s;&s;es, a preceding ver&s;e contains your me&s;&s;age. Ho! every one that thir&s;teth, come ye to the waters: and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price. The great &s;upper is prepared. Go out ye mini&s;ters into the &s;treets and lanes of the city. Go out, ye Mi&s;&s;ionaries, into the high-ways and hedges and compel to come in that the hou&s;e may be filled. Go ye into all the world, preach the go&s;pel to every creature. A man qualified for the &s;phere at a mi&s;&s;ionary looks forth on the &s;ea of the world; notwith&s;tanding his fears, and di&s;appointments, at the word of his &s;aviour, he ca&s;ts his net and becomes a fi&s;her of men. He is led forth by a conviction of the value of a &s;oul, by the attractions of divine love, by the openings of divine providence and by the hand of his fellow Chri&s;tians. Are mi&s;&s;ionary &s;ocieties e&s;tabli&s;hed? he hearkens to their in&s;tructions, enjoys their patronage, and &s;hares in their addre&s;&s;es to the heavenly throne. Clad with zeal as with a cloak, his faith &s;ub&s;tantiating the hoped for ble&s;&s;ing, the fearing of the name of the Lord from the we&s;t, and his glory from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un; he cries, I will go in the &s;trength of the Lord God, I will make mention of thy righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>even</HI> of thine only.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity produces in the hearts of its mini&s;ters or mi&s;&s;ionaries the emotions of joy. They who bear the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;anctuary with joy, may draw water from the wells of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>The faithful Mi&s;&s;ionary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the joy which &s;prings from con&s;cious integrity. Rectitude and plea&s;ure are a&s;&s;ociates. In the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of an evil man there is a &s;nare, but the righteous doth &s;ing and rejoice. We acknowledge the pure&s;t conduct may be a&s;cribed to the ba&s;e&s;t motives. Though a Mi&s;&s;ionary, &s;ired with love to God and to
<PB N="14" REF="034599_0011_0FFF1148802FC678">
man, &s;ubject him&s;elf to perils by &s;ea and perils by land. Though he pa&s;s over toil&s;ome hills and gloomy de&s;arts, his only &s;u&s;tenance the berries of the fore&s;t and the waters of the brook. Though he be wet with the &s;howers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a &s;helter. Though like Jacob when the &s;un is &s;et, he have only the &s;tones of the place for his pillow, and his life be endangered from wild bea&s;ts or wilder men: neither his piety, his fortitude, nor his &s;ufferings can &s;ecure him from the imputations of calumny. But let calumny prepare its bittere&s;t accu&s;ations. Term him, ye children of the wicked one, a deceiver, a fanatic, or let him &s;uffer reproaches from fal&s;e or mi&s;taken brethren; he approves him&s;elf a mini&s;ter of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in nece&s;&s;ities, in di&s;tre&s;&s;es; by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteou&s;ne&s;s. He is as &s;orrowful, yet alway rejoicing. Perceiving that primitive mi&s;&s;ion|aries who were in perils by the &s;ea and in perils by the heathen, in wearine&s;s and painfulne&s;s, in cold and nakedne&s;s, &s;uffered the mo&s;t cruel reproaches, as their follower, with them he cries, our rejoicing is this, that in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity, not with fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conver&s;ation in the world. He is a good man and is &s;atisfied from him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But not more does he rejoice in the purity of his motives, than in the excellency of his cau&s;e. It is truth and mu&s;t prevail. Je&s;uits have endured exce&s;&s;ive fatigue, and have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to dangers and deaths for the di&s;&s;emination of their erroneous &s;entiments; but the mi&s;&s;ionaries we contemplate labour not, &s;uffer not, that eccle&s;ia&s;tical thunders may terrify the heathen, that human creeds may be impo&s;ed by civil force, that a cro&s;s may be worn, that a ho&s;t may be wor&s;hipped. They acknowledge no &s;overeign over con&s;cience but him whom winds and &s;ea obey; no &s;y&s;tem of &s;aith, no
<PB N="15" REF="034599_0012_0FFF114A0821D150">
rules of conduct incon&s;i&s;tent with his holy oracles. They go out with joy while they reflect, that though &s;uper&s;titious zeal and literary artifice, the malice of individuals and the per&s;ecutions of empire have been employed for its de&s;truction, the Go&s;pel they deliver, &s;tands like an awful column firm proof again&s;t the winds, the lightnings, the earthquakes of envious ages.&mdash;They addre&s;s them&s;elves to their work animated by a conviction, that the word of the Lord abideth for ever.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel mi&s;&s;ionary goes out with the joy which &s;prings from benevolence. Good will towards men, enters into the &s;oul of the go&s;pel. Through all the word of God a &s;elfi&s;h temper is forbidden&mdash;We mu&s;t do good and communicate. None of us liveth to him&s;elf, none of us dieth to him&s;elf. Mi&s;&s;ionaries are commonly &s;ent among nations who have changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, four-footed bea&s;ts, and creeping things. His &s;pirit, like the apo&s;tle's is &s;tirred up within him, while he perceives cities and kingdoms wholly given to idolatry.

But his heart is in&s;pired with a &s;acred enthu&s;ia&s;m while he contemplates the good, of the approach of which he is &s;o well a&s;&s;ured. He goes out with promi&s;es of &s;upport.

<P>He goes out with pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s. Whatever degree of ble&s;&s;ing may attend particular mi&s;&s;ions, it is certain that the go&s;pel of the kingdom &s;hall be preached in all the world for a witne&s;s unto all nations. The Me&s;&s;iah has a&s;ked and has received the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The heroes of antiquity were filled with tran&s;port at the ambiguous an&s;wers of the oracle of Delphos. Favourable re&s;pon&s;es from the gloomy cavern of Trophonius, would render the credulous Grecian fearle&s;s in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t dreadful danger. An American Indian, relying on the friendly dreams of a &s;ooth-&s;ayer, goes forth to war with all the confidence of &s;ucce&s;s. But how infinitely greater is the encourage|ment of a man of God. He credits no dreamer of dreams. He believes in the Lord his God and is e&s;tabli&s;hed. I have not &s;poken, &s;aith Jehovah, in &s;ecret, in a dark place of the earth: I the Lord &s;peak righteou&s;ne&s;s: I give direct an&s;wers.&mdash;The promi&s;es in Chri&s;t are yea and amen. When Je&s;us was about to be &s;eparated from his di&s;ciples, and was commi&s;&s;ioning them to publi&s;h his go&s;pel, having given them promi&s;es of &s;upport and pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s, he &s;aid, the&s;e things have I &s;poken that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</P>
<P>Ye &s;hall go out with joy and be led forth with peace. The di&s;ciples of Je&s;us po&s;&s;e&s;s peaceful di&s;po&s;itions. Pride, ob&s;tinacy, and &s;everity, are frequently charged on the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity. If the charge be true, the guilt is wholly their own. Ignorance may be proud, bigotry may be ob&s;tinate, and malice may be &s;evere; but the go&s;pel is de&s;igned to make the ignorant wi&s;e, and the ill-natured gentle. It teaches us to put off as a &s;hameful

<P>Mi&s;&s;ionaries go forth with peaceful me&s;&s;ages. With angels their proclaim, on earth peace. Theirs is the word which God &s;ent unto the children of I&s;rael, preaching peace by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Mahomet, for the propagation of his religion, encouraged his followers to make pro&s;elytes by force of arms. The&s;e are his words in the Koran,

<Q>As for tho&s;e who fight in the &s;ervice of God's true religion, God will not &s;uffer their work to peri&s;h, he will lead them into paradi&s;e.</Q>
How different the words of the Prince of Peace! Put thy &s;word into the &s;heath, &s;aid he to Peter, and imme|diately touched and healed the man who&s;e ear Peter had cut off. Je&s;us an&s;wered to Pilate, If my king|dom were of this world, then would my &s;ervants fight, that I &s;hould not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence.</P>
<P>Of &s;uch who deviate from the Arabian religion, the fal&s;e prophet &s;ays,

but when our Lord fir&s;t &s;hewed him&s;elf after his re&s;urrection to the di&s;ciples who in the hour of darkne&s;s had all for&s;ook him and fled, he &s;aid, Peace be unto you; as my father hath &s;ent me &s;o &s;end I you.</P>
<P>But peaceful as are the di&s;po&s;itions and me&s;&s;ages of the propagators of the go&s;pel, they have often been charged with &s;editious de&s;igns. Guilt has turned the moral world up&s;ide down. It re&s;embles an inverted pyramid, which only the long&s;uffering hand of God prevents from falling into awful ruin. When the apo&s;tles by manife&s;tation of the truth, by revealing one mighty to &s;ave, were de&s;irous of placing the fearful pyramid on its ba&s;is, the Jews of The&s;&s;alonica cried, the&s;e that have turned the

<P>There is a &s;en&s;e in which Chri&s;t him&s;elf came not to &s;end peace, but a &s;word; the di&s;ciples are imitators of him. They go forth armed to de&s;troy that peace of the world, by which men engage not to di&s;turb each others quiet in the way to hell. Peace without righteou&s;ne&s;s is but a dead calm, before a de&s;olating tornado. Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, &s;aith the Lord, and I will heal him.

<P N="2">II. On the people to whom a chri&s;tian mi&s;&s;ion is directed.</P>
<P>While Mi&s;&s;ionaries go out with joy and are led forth with peace, mountains and hills break forth before them into &s;inging, and all the trees of the field clap their hands. In the Old Te&s;tament, allu&s;ions to hills and mountains are very frequent. The land of Judah is called the country of the hills. Jo&s;h. x. 40. Prophets derived their emblems from
<PB N="20" REF="034599_0017_0FFF137698026878">
&s;urrounding objects. Would they give dying mortals a &s;trong idea of the eternity of God? They cry before his foot&s;tool, Thou ha&s;t been our dwelling place in all generations, before the mountains were brought forth, from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting thou art God. Is a &s;en&s;e of the maje&s;ty of Jehovah to be impre&s;&s;ed on the hearts of the people? Hills are &s;een &s;moking at his touch. They reveal him weighing mountains in &s;cales and hills in balances. Would they expre&s;s abundance of temporal good? Hills flow with milk and mountains drop down &s;weet wine, for the cattle and the vines are there. Have they to repre&s;ent a &s;tate of tremendous de&s;pair? Wretches are heard crying, Rocks! fall on us, mountains! cover us. Would they exhibit the end of all things? Hills are departing, mountains are not found. Does a jealous God draw near to judgment? Who can &s;tand before his indignation? His way is in the whirlwind and in the &s;torm, clouds are the du&s;t of his feet; the mountains quake at him and the hills melt; but when prophets di&s;play the God of &s;alvation, the deliverer of his people, mountains and hills break forth before them into &s;inging.</P>
<P>There is a &s;trange power in the human mind of converting every thing, in imagination, to the likene&s;s of it&s;elf. The mind &s;eems as capable of acting on external objects, as external objects are of acting on the mind. Does an individual mourn? To him all nature appears to partake his &s;orrows. Does he rejoice? Mountains and hills &s;eem to feel his raptures, and trees of the field to clap their hands.</P>
<P>When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, the people were like them that dream. Their mouths were filled with laughter, and their tongues with &s;inging. But there was &s;till greater occa&s;ion for triumph, than their relea&s;e from Babylon.</P>
<P>The Hebrews often a&s;ked, and God often granted &s;igns from heaven. When our Lord was working

the mightie&s;t miracles among the Jews, they were impatient for a &s;ign. They had conceived the Me&s;&s;iah was to re&s;cue them from Roman &s;ervitude. Fal&s;e Chri&s;ts had per&s;uaded the people to follow them, promi&s;ing them miracles and <HI>&s;igns of liberty.</HI> Unle&s;s the dead were rai&s;ed, or the ocean calmed as pledges of approaching victory over Rome, they were con&s;idered as inadequate proofs that Je&s;us was both Lord and Chri&s;t. To the Jews no &s;ign but the prophet Jonas was given. No other was needed. But when an event &s;eemed remote from the promi&s;e or the threatening, &s;igns the mo&s;t &s;triking en&s;ued. Eli! this &s;hall be a &s;ign unto thee, that there &s;hall not be an old man in thy hou&s;e forever, Hophni and Phineas &s;hall die both in one day. Hezekiah! this &s;ign &s;halt thou have that the Lord will heal thee, the &s;un &s;hall go backward ten degrees on the dial of thy father. Ahaz! the Lord him&s;elf will give thee a &s;ign, that the coun&s;els of Rezin and Pekah &s;hall not &s;tand: Behold! a virgin &s;hall conceive and bear a &s;on and &s;hall call his name Emmanuel. Shepherds! this &s;hall be a &s;ign unto you, ye &s;hall find the babe wrapt in &s;waddling clothes, lying in a manger. O Judah! thy deliverance from captivity is a token of future, greater ble&s;&s;ings: it &s;hall be for an everla&s;ting &s;ign, that &s;hall not he cut off, v. 13. Let us not &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves, brethren, unintere&s;ted in the re&s;toration of the Jews from Babylon. We have already ju&s;tified the application of ancient predictions to the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel; while we perceive that their primary fulfilment is only a pledge of their re-accompli&s;hment in the latter days, let our faith be &s;trong and our joy be full.</P>
<P>Wherever the glorious go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God is circulated, there are glad tidings of great joy; and they, who&s;e hearts receive it in its power, are excited to &s;ing aloud of the great &s;alvation it brings. There are a variety of &s;en&s;es in which chri&s;tianity may be viewed as tending to promote the happine&s;s

of any people. Let us contemplate its effects, fir&s;t, on men in general; and &s;econdly, on believers in particular.</P>
<P>We know that to an unbelieving world, the publi&s;hing of the go&s;pel is folly and madne&s;s. Far from rejoicing, modern infidels, like infidels of old, are <HI>grieved</HI> at the preaching of Je&s;us and the re&s;urrection. The carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God; but yet carnal minds derive many temporal advantages from the very &s;y&s;tem they abhor. The de&s;truction of the tares is delayed, becau&s;e the wheat is yet in the field.</P>
<P>The diffu&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity is a mo&s;t joyful event in regard of the re&s;traints it impo&s;es on vice. It le&s;&s;ens the number of vicious examples. It &s;ets iniquity before men in the mo&s;t hateful light. Conviction glares on the guilty mind, &s;udden, awful, unexpected as the lightning, and the &s;inner trembles in &s;pite of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Contemplate its influence on <HI>idolatry.</HI> Wherever the chri&s;tian &s;tandard has been planted, idols have been broken and confounded. Where are the deities of Greece and Rome? Who now adores the divinity of Juno, or as a &s;uppliant, places a &s;acrifice on her altars? Aeolus and Neptune cea&s;e to be venerated, &s;ince he hath appeared who holds the winds in his fi&s;t, and the waters in the hollow of his hand. Pluto and Pro&s;erpine are wor&s;hipped no more; the a&s;toni&s;hed idolater perceives, that he who was dead and is alive again, hath the keys of hell and death.

And it is not to be doubted, but that if this method (of reading and explaining the &s;criptures on the Lord's day) were once dropped among us, the generality of the people, whatever el&s;e may be done to obviate it, would in &s;even years relap&s;e into as bad a &s;tate of barbarity, as was ever in practice among the wor&s;t of our Saxon or Dani&s;h ance&s;tors."</P>

Formerly, the laws of war were rigorous in the extreme; Chri&s;tianity has ameliorated them. Formerly, confident that va&s;&s;alage or death mu&s;t be the fate of the vanqui&s;hed, men fought with a ferocity approaching to madne&s;s; but, Chri&s;tianity has taught the &s;hewing of mercy, has e&s;tabli&s;hed a habit of exchanging pri&s;oners, and rendered war le&s;s de&s;tructive, by making captivity le&s;s dreadful. In the pre&s;ent day, through countries where the go&s;pel is not known, pri&s;oners of war are victims devoted

The evils that have attended political admini&s;tration in Europe, &s;ince the reign of Con&s;tan|tine, have ari&s;en from the mon&s;trous a&s;&s;ociation of the church and &s;tate. Ambition for the &s;ceptre gave ri&s;e to the mitre, and transformed the pretended de&s;cendants of humble fi&s;hermen into haughty pontiffs.

It has put an end to the expo&s;ure of children, and the immolation of &s;laves. It has &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the combats of gladiators, and the impurities of religious rites. It has bani&s;hed if not unnatural vices, at lea&s;t the toleration of them. It has greatly meliorated the condition of the laborious poor, that is to &s;ay, of the great ma&s;s of every community, by procuring for them a day of weekly re&s;t. In all countries in which it is profe&s;&s;ed, it has produced numerous e&s;tabli&s;hments for the relief of &s;ickne&s;s and poverty, and in &s;ome a regular and general provi&s;ion by law.

It eclip&s;es that &s;plendour of the rich and the mighty, before which the vulgar &s;hrink into veneration and &s;ervility. It regards all men as &s;inners, and proclaims a common &s;alvation. It directs men of every cla&s;s to a&s;&s;emble for wor&s;hip together, and foretels their general meeting around the throne of the Judge of all.

<P>Chri&s;tianity is native wi&s;dom; &s;uper&s;tition is imitative folly.

<P>But O how great, how numerous are they! Born not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God. The joyful Chri&s;tian looks up to the ruler of heaven and cries, abba, father! Behold, &s;ays Je&s;us, I make all things new; the believer feels his creating power. Old things pa&s;s away; his hopes, his fears, his joys, his &s;orrows, his companions, his pro&s;pects, all things become new. He looks over the li&s;t of his offences, and his heart is filled with confu&s;ion and deep repentance; he looks to his &s;uffering Redeemer, and rejoices with joy un&s;peakable, while he hears him &s;ay, &s;on, thy &s;ins are forgiven thee. He is ble&s;t with acce&s;s by the new and living way to the heavenly throne. While a believer is liftinq his cry and looking up, Jehovah is bowing the heavens and coming down. <HI>He</HI> draws nigh to God; <HI>God</HI> draws nigh to him. God contemplates and is delighted with his own perfections; the believer contemplates in his humble mea&s;ure, and is delighted with the perfections of his God. A Chri&s;tian holds communion with the &s;upreme maje&s;ty. Laugh ye prophane! employ your railings again&s;t the good man's experience; he minds it not. If we &s;ay we have no fellow&s;hip with him we lie, for truly our fellow&s;hip is with the father and with his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>Old Babylon, after the conque&s;ts of Cyrus, continued gradually to decay.

Its progre&s;s many of the offended &s;ons of men are &s;triving to retard; but the effort is as fooli&s;h and u&s;ele&s;s as the conduct of the Thracians in di&s;charging arrows at the heavens, becau&s;e angry at un&s;ea&s;onable &s;howers. Stop the revolution of the earth, arre&s;t time in its flight, and then try to hinder the advance of the Redeemer's kingdom. Hu&s;h the roaring of &s;ummer thunders, and then &s;ilence the deepening groans of creation, waiting for the adoption.</P>
<P>It is a plea&s;ing pre&s;age that a MISSIONARY SPIRIT has gone forth in the world. Among the rivers in A&s;ia, in the wilds of Africa, and on the mountains of America, publi&s;hers of &s;alvation are to be found. The firmament of the church is widening and new &s;tars are di&s;playing the new creation's glory. Hindoos are cea&s;ing to wor&s;hip their Ganges, and idols are fami&s;hed. The Ethiopian is chilled with the view of his crimes, and the Greenlander warmed with redeeming love. From the uttermo&s;t part of the earth have we heard &s;ongs, even, glory to the righteous.</P>
<P>MY BRETHREN,</P>
<P>In the interior of the country we inhabit, there are thou&s;and of Indians who are covered with gro&s;s darkne&s;s. We have brought our families and our

manners to their &s;hores, let us &s;hew them, that we have brought with us a volume which may prove a light unto their feet and a lamp to their paths. Let us point them to the mark of the prize of the high calling of chri&s;tians, a mark by which they may "&s;teer" with confidence through "the wilderne&s;s" of this perplexing world.</P>
<P>Let neither their <HI>imagined</HI> virtues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"It has become fa&s;hionable of late years for the philo&s;ophers of Europe to celebrate the virtues of the &s;avages of America.&mdash; Whether the de&s;ign of their encomiums was to expo&s;e Chri&s;tian|ity and depreciate the advantages of civilization, I know not, but they have evidently had tho&s;e effects upon the minds of weak people."
<BIBL>Dr. RUSH's ESSAYS.</BIBL></P>
<P>From the travels of Charlevoix, Hennepen, Carver, &amp;c. the doctor demon&s;trates that <HI>uncleanne&s;s, na&s;tine&s;s, drunkenne&s;s, gluttony, treachery, cruelty, idlene&s;s, theft, gaming,</HI> and <HI>the degrading of their women</HI> are common vices. He concludes a &s;hort, but very in&s;tructive e&s;&s;ay on the &s;ubject with &s;aying; "How great is the efficacy of Chri&s;tianity, which by purifying the heart, renders the practice of the contrary virtues natural and agreeable!"</P></NOTE> nor their <HI>real</HI> vices prevent your exertions.</P>
<P>Are Indians <HI>unclean?</HI> Send the go&s;pel among them. This will teach every one how to po&s;&s;e&s;s his ve&s;&s;el in &s;anctification and honour. It will &s;hew to them that marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled; but that whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</P>
<P>Are they <HI>filthy</HI> in their manners and per&s;ons? Send them the go&s;pel. They will learn from it to clean&s;e them&s;elves from all filthine&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit. Having their hearts &s;prinkled from an evil con&s;cience, their bodies will be wa&s;hed as with pure water. The body will be re&s;pected when regarded as a temple for the Holy Gho&s;t. Health and clean|line&s;s follow the pious ob&s;ervance of the Lord's day.</P>
<P>Are Indians <HI>drunkards?</HI> Send the go&s;pel among them. Let Mi&s;&s;ionaries cry at the door of their tents, Take heed to your&s;elves, le&s;t at any time your hearts be overcharged with &s;urfeiting and drunkenne&s;s! Wo unto them that ri&s;e up early in the morning that they may follow &s;trong drink, that

continue unto night, until wine (or rum) enflame them. When they know that drunkenne&s;s at la&s;t biteth like a &s;erpent and &s;tingeth like an adder, and that drunkards &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God, we may expect that by this vice, whole tribes will be no more de&s;troyed, and that Indians will cea&s;e to glory in their &s;hame.</P>
<P>Are they <HI>gluttonous?</HI> Send them the go&s;pel, and their belly will &s;oon cea&s;e to be their God. The body will be kept under, and be brought into &s;ubjection. A&s;&s;i&s;ted to put on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, provi&s;ion will not be made for the fle&s;h to fulfil its lu&s;ts. They will u&s;e the world as not abu&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Are Indians <HI>treacherous?</HI> Send the go&s;pel among them, that they may have their conver&s;ation in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity. It is only by this means that with re&s;pect to public treaties, or private dealings, you will be prevented from &s;aying their tongue is <HI>an arrow &s;hot out,</HI> it &s;peaketh deceit: one &s;peaketh peaceably with his mouth, but in heart he layeth wait. Embracing the religion of the king of truth, they will become true men.</P>
<P>Are they <HI>cruel?</HI> Send them the go&s;pel! In&s;tead of regarding compa&s;&s;ion as effeminacy, they will con|&s;ider it as a mark of human greatne&s;s. In&s;truments of cruelty &s;hall be &s;ought for in vain, in their habi|tations. Under the influence of Chri&s;tianity the &s;calping knife and the hatchet will become u&s;ele&s;s, and the war-hoop and death-&s;ong be forgotten. The lion and the wolf &s;hall become gentle as the kid or the lamb. That heart cannot be cruel in which the love of God is &s;hed abroad.</P>
<P>Are Indians <HI>idle?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"Their work advances under their hand with &s;uch &s;lowne&s;s, that an eye witne&s;s compares it to the imperceptible progre&s;s of vegetation.

would not work, neither &s;hould he eat. We be&s;eech you that ye &s;tudy to be quiet, and to do your own bu&s;ine&s;s, and to work with your own hands, that ye may walk hone&s;tly.</P>
<P>Are they <HI>di&s;hone&s;t?</HI> Send them the go&s;pel. Let them know, that this is the will of God that no man go beyond or defraud his brother in any matter, becau&s;e that the Lord is the avenger of all &s;uch. Let him that &s;tole, &s;teal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing that is good. Let none &s;uffer as a thief.</P>
<P>Are Indians fond of <HI>gaming?</HI> Send the go&s;pel among them! By teaching its converts to come out from ungodly company, to care for them of their own hou&s;hold, and to &s;hun deceit and lying, it de&s;troys the injurious practice. Such who beguile un&s;table &s;ouls, having hearts exerci&s;ed with covetous practices are cur&s;ed children. Spots they are and blemi&s;hes, &s;porting them&s;elves with their own deceivings, who &s;hall receive the reward of unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Are they in the habit of degrading their women? Send them the go&s;pel, which &s;ays, Let the hu&s;band render to the wife due benevolence, giving honour to her as the weaker ve&s;&s;el, and as being heirs together of the grace of life. Let every one of you love his wife even as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel is &s;uited to the removal of the vices which di&s;grace the Indian tribes; and where it is received in power, in&s;tead of the brier, will come up the fir-tree, and in&s;tead of the thorn, the myrtle tree. In&s;tead of uncleanne&s;s, there will be purity; in&s;tead of drunkenne&s;s, &s;obriety; in&s;tead of treachery, integrity; in&s;tead of cruelty, mercy; in&s;tead of indolence, indu&s;try; in&s;tead of theft, hone&s;ty; and in&s;tead of contempt for females; the mother, the wife, the daughter, and the &s;i&s;ter will be loved and re&s;pected as tender, faithful friends.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="034599_0039_0FFF13B0AE6BC230">This conviction, united with an ardent de&s;ire to glorify God in the exerci&s;e of Chri&s;tian benevolence towards the heathen, gave birth to the PHILADEL|PHIA MISSIONARY SOCIETY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Philadelphia Mi&s;&s;ionary Society, was formed in the month of January 1798. Three &s;ermons were preached on the occa&s;ion, by Rev. MORGAN J. RHEES. The fir&s;t from Rom. i. 15, 16. &mdash;The &s;econd from Rom. x. 12&mdash;15.&mdash;The third from Luke xvi. 31.&mdash;The object of the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e was to pourtray the cha|racter of a primitive Mi&s;&s;ionary, his commi&s;&s;ion, and the effect of its delivery on nations and on believing individuals. Additional motives were urged to encourage a mi&s;&s;ion among the American heathen. The &s;econd di&s;cour&s;e had for its object to prove, that God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, that the riches of his grace are communicated to men by means of preaching, and that the preachers are &s;ent and &s;upported by men as well as by God. It was concluded by enforcing it as a duty, incumbent on every Chri&s;tian to contribute towards teaching all nations the principles of pure and undefiled religion. The third di&s;cour&s;e was applied particularly to infidels and libertines, its principal object was to &s;hew the &s;ufficiency of Revelation. That it contains ample evidence of its truth to convince any rea&s;onable creature who will take the pains to examine it and that therefore we are not to expect Jehovah will rai&s;e any per&s;on from the dead, to convert nominal Chri&s;tians or to convince the heathen; that therefore it is our duty to &s;end me&s;&s;engers of peace among them, that they may have Mo&s;es and the prophets, Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles to bear te&s;timony to the truth. If they reject, we &s;hall be clear from their blood.</P>
<P>Since the above period the number of members and the pro&s;|pects of doing good have gradually increa&s;ed, and it is hoped that ere long Mi&s;&s;ionaries, under their cheerful guidance, and under the guidance of the God of love, will go out with joy, and be led forth with peace.</P></NOTE>. This Society, while it is anxious that the heathen may hear the faithful &s;aying, that Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners; is de&s;irous of introducing among the Indians &s;ome of tho&s;e arts which lead the way to civilization, ignorance of which is an indirect auxiliary to the commi&s;&s;ion of various crimes. The introduction of the loom, the forge, and the plough, of tame animals, and of u&s;eful metals is contemplated; that by the increa&s;e of civil information, the wall of partition

between Indians and the United States may be broken down, and the tomahawk and the bayonet become u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Every in&s;titution of this nature merits patronage; and it becomes each individual to exerci&s;e his influence for the advancement of &s;o pious a de&s;ign. Shall I attempt to produce farther arguments to excite you to fulfil the good plea&s;ure of God? Shall I remind you of the prodigious numbers of our fellow men who are yet involved in ignorance and mi&s;ery? Shall I pre&s;s on you the value of the go&s;pel, that it con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>glad tidings to peri&s;hing &s;inners?</HI> Shall I remind you of the example of Je&s;us who went about doing good, and who&s;e zeal for the hou&s;e of God con&s;umed him? Shall I refer you to the holy apo&s;tles, who counted not their lives dear, &s;o they might fulfil their mini&s;terial cour&s;e? Shall I pre&s;s on you, that zeal for the Lord of ho&s;ts has lately given ri&s;e to many mi&s;&s;ionary &s;ocieties, and refer you to Scotland, to Germany, to England and to New-York? Need I tell you that carele&s;&s;ne&s;s is guilt, and indolence ignoble? Shall I point you to nature, full of labour all around you, and invite re&s;tle&s;s winds, rolling tides, ri&s;ing vegetables, and revolving orbs to put your inactivity to the blu&s;h? Shall I exhibit the encouragements to &s;ending mi&s;&s;ionaries among the Indians, derivable from an Indian's believing in the <HI>Great Spirit</HI> and in a <HI>future &s;tate;</HI> from the peace now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them and us, and from their proximity to us? Shall I a&s;&s;ert the honor of being fellow-workers with God, the plea&s;ure that &s;prings from fulfilling our duty and doing good, and the probability of &s;ucce&s;s deducible from the &s;igns of the times? I per&s;uade my&s;elf the ta&s;k is unnece&s;&s;ary. I per&s;uade my&s;elf that you are ready to cry out, How &s;hall we begin to te&s;tify our zeal? what immediate mea&s;ure &s;hall we adopt for aiding &s;o benevolent a de&s;ign?

&s;eeing this evening a fulfilment of that animating prophecy. They &s;hall bring their &s;ilver and their gold with them unto the name of the Lord thy God. At the clo&s;e of this &s;ervice your liberality will have a fair opportunity for its exertion. The &s;ociety, for which I have this evening the honour to plead, is weak; it has implored the fatherly care of Heaven, and now would welcome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from you. As yet 'tis a little one, but we tru&s;t the little one will become a thou&s;and. In the exerci&s;e of that generous zeal which will give plea&s;ure in death, and expecting the Ma&s;ter's ble&s;&s;ing, we hope to &s;ee mountains and hills, the Andes and the Alleghany break forth into &s;inging, and the trees of <HI>the wilder|ne&s;s</HI> clap their hands in go&s;pel harmony.
