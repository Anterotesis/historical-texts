<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Honours, and you Gentlemen of the Jury.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE pri&s;oners at the bar, are that party of &s;oldiers be|longing to his Maje&s;ty's 29th regiment, who in the evening of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, were induced from &s;ome cau&s;e or other to fire on the inhabitants of this town, in <HI>King &s;treet.</HI></P>
<P>They are charged in five di&s;tinct indictments, with the wilful premeditated murder of five different per&s;ons mentioned in the re&s;pective bills; to each of the&s;e indict|ments, they have &s;everally pleaded, <HI>not guilty</HI>; and by that plea have thrown upon the crown the burthen of proving the fact alledged again&s;t them: It is my province therefore to give you evidence in &s;upport of this charge, and yours, gentlemen of the Jury, to determine whether they are guil|ty, or not.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e is &s;olemn and important; no le&s;s than whe|ther eight of your fellow &s;ubjects &s;hall live or die! A cau&s;e grounded on the mo&s;t melancholy event that has yet taken place on the continent of <HI>America,</HI> and perhaps of the greate&s;t expectation of any that has yet come before a tri|bunal of civil ju&s;tice, in this part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions.</P>
<P>I am aware how difficult, in ca&s;es of this &s;ort, it ever is, and more e&s;pecially &s;o in <HI>the&s;e times,</HI> and in <HI>this trial,</HI> to pre|&s;erve the mind perfectly indifferent; but I remember, we are bound, not only by the natural obligations towards God and man, but al&s;o by an oath, to examine into the evi|dence of fact without <HI>partiality</HI> or <HI>prejudice;</HI> I need not therefore caution you of your duty in this re&s;pect: It is upon that evidence and the law re&s;ulting from it, you gen|tlemen are, in the language of your oath, to give a ver|dict; and I will venture, before hand, to pronounce that verdict <HI>righteous,</HI> if it is founded in the&s;e principles as the rule of your judgment.</P>
<P>It has become my duty, it &s;hall therefore be my en|deavor, to acquit my&s;elf in the cour&s;e of this trial with

<P>There are two things nece&s;&s;ary to prove, which I men|tioned in the fir&s;t opening of this cau&s;e, namely, the iden|tity of the pri&s;oners, that is, that they were that party of men who on the 5th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t were in <HI>King-&s;treet,</HI> and that they committed the facts mentioned in the indictments, and farther gentlemen, the circum&s;tances attending and aggravating the commi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e facts.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t point, to prove the identity of the pri&s;on|ers, all of them have been &s;worn to, and mo&s;t of them by more than one witne&s;s.</P>
<P>To <HI>KILLROY</HI> gentlemen, you have <HI>Langford, Archibald</HI> and <HI>Brewer,</HI> who &s;wear po&s;itively; and farther you have the evidence of <HI>Ferriter</HI> and <HI>Hemmingway.</HI> The one, of <HI>Killroy</HI>'s being in the affray at the rope-walks, and the o|ther to his uttering a number of malicious and threatning expre&s;&s;ions in regard to the inhabitants of the town of <HI>Bo&s;|ton.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>WHITE</HI> gentlemen, you have four more, <HI>Simp&s;on, Langford, Bailey</HI> and <HI>Clark.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>MONTGOMERY,</HI> you have <HI>Bailey, Palmes, Ba&s;s, Dan|brook</HI> and <HI>Wilkin&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>HARTEGAN,</HI> you have <HI>Danbrook</HI> and <HI>Simp&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>WEMMS,</HI> you have <HI>Simp&s;on</HI> and <HI>Bridgham.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="011683_0028_0F87C83E6180FEF0">To <HI>CARROL, Bailey</HI> and <HI>Danbrook.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>WARREN, Bridgham, Dodge</HI> and <HI>Simp&s;on. Bridgham</HI> indeed expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome doubt, and gave his rea&s;ons for it, which may be worthy notice hereafter.</P>
<P>To <HI>M'CAULEY,</HI> you have Mr. <HI>Au&s;tin.</HI></P>
<P>And that <HI>Warren</HI> was at the Rope-walks, you have al&s;o the te&s;timony of Mr. <HI>Ferriter.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e witne&s;&s;es as I have mentioned them to you, have te&s;tified on oath to the &s;everal pri&s;oners, that they were that evening in <HI>King-&s;treet,</HI> and of the party; the next thing to be enquired into gentlemen is as to the facts. In order to a&s;certain the&s;e it will be nece&s;&s;ary to have re|cour&s;e to the te&s;timony of the witne&s;&s;es. I could have wi&s;hed I had been able, after the fatigue of ye&s;terday, to have ranged the evidence in the order of time as the facts took place; but not being able to do this, I mu&s;t take them up as the witne&s;&s;es were examined. I will however endeavour to &s;tate the facts in the be&s;t arrangement I can.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t witne&s;s Mr. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> &s;ays, that he was in <HI>King-&s;treet</HI> that evening, near the Sentry-box which was pla|ced at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e</HI>; that about a quarter after nine he &s;aw the party coming from the <HI>Main-guard</HI>; when they got down to the Sentry box, they wheeled to the left and formed them&s;elves round it; and in coming round <HI>M'Cauley</HI> pu&s;hed at him with his bayonet, damned him, and bid him to &s;tand off, this was the fir&s;t in&s;tance of their conduct. Mr. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> was not paticular who fired, his back being towards the &s;oldiers when that happened. He &s;ays there were five or &s;ix guns fired; and he &s;aw <HI>M'Cauley</HI> after the firing. The&s;e are the mo&s;t material circum&s;tances of his te&s;timony.</P>
<P>The next witne&s;s is <HI>Bridgham,</HI> who &s;ays he was in <HI>King-&s;treet</HI> al&s;o; and the next morning when he went to the goal to view the pri&s;oners, he apprehended he had &s;een <HI>Warren</HI> in <HI>King &s;treet</HI> the evening before, but afterwards he &s;aw a per&s;on that looked very like him belonging to the &s;ame regiment, which occa&s;ioned him to doubt whether he was the man or not; my remark upon this, is, it was probable that the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions made on his mind were the &s;trong|e&s;t, and therefore you cannot well doubt he was right in judging that <HI>Warren</HI> was in fact the per&s;on he &s;aw the e|vening before; he &s;aw al&s;o <HI>Wemms</HI> the corporal &s;tationed on the left of the party betwixt him and the tall man; the <HI>Corporal</HI> was on the left entire, if &s;o gentlemen, <HI>War|ren</HI>

mu&s;t have been the third man from the left in that &s;i|tuation; there were a number of people he &s;ays round the party huzzaing, &s;ome having &s;ticks; his face was the other way when the fir&s;t gun went off, he heard a noi&s;e like the cla&s;hing of guns, he &s;aw <HI>Gray</HI> fall, and &s;ays the per&s;on that killed him, mu&s;t have been near the center of the par|ty; when the left man fired there were but few in the &s;treet, they divided and were pa&s;&s;ing off; the la&s;t man that fired, he &s;ays leveled his piece, following a lad that was running down the &s;treet before he fired; he al&s;o mentions a number of people coming down from the north &s;ide of the <HI>Town-hou&s;e,</HI> collected as he &s;uppo&s;ed by the bells, and not di&s;po&s;|ed to commit any injury what&s;oever; he did not apprehend him&s;elf, or the &s;oldiers in any danger from any thing he ob&s;erved; he &s;ays about &s;even guns were fired, and there were about twelve people at that time before the party.&mdash; The&s;e are the mo&s;t material circum&s;tances in his evidence.</P>
<P><HI>Dodge</HI> &s;ays, he &s;aw <HI>Warren,</HI> but cannot &s;wear to any of the re&s;t, the man who fired fir&s;t he thinks &s;tood towards the left, about two from the corner, however he was over at <HI>Vernon</HI>'s &s;hop acro&s;s the &s;treet, and perhaps not able to make &s;o good ob&s;ervations as &s;ome others; he &s;aw about fifty people in the &s;treet, but he &s;aw nothing in their hands; he &s;aw a number of &s;now balls thrown, but none as he ob&s;erved with violence or in anger; he &s;aw the people near the party of &s;oldiers, and they pu&s;hing at them with their bayonets; he does not imagine there was any thing be&s;ides &s;now balls thrown.</P>
<P><HI>Clark</HI> the next witne&s;s, &s;aw <HI>White</HI> the Sentinel at his &s;tation ju&s;t before nine o'clock, that he &s;poke to him, but &s;aw no one at that time near or mole&s;ting him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Langford</HI> comes next, and this witne&s;s is perhaps as particular as any one witne&s;s on the part of the Crown; it appears by the relation of his evidence that he came down about nine o'clock as a watchman, in order to go to the <HI>Watch-hou&s;e</HI> next adjoining the <HI>Town hou&s;e</HI>; when he came down, he was told the people and &s;oldiers were fighting at <HI>Murray</HI>'s <HI>Barracks;</HI> upon this, he took his cour&s;e that way, but the matter being over by the time h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> got there, he returned to <HI>King-&s;treet</HI>: there were a number of boys round the Sentinel, to whom he &s;poke and told hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he need not fear, the boys would not hurt him; &s;oon after this the Sentinel without &s;aying any thing to the people
<PB N="57" REF="011683_0029_0F87C840245E7490">
went up the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e</HI> &s;teps and knocked at the door; a per&s;on within opened it and &s;aid &s;omething, but what, the witne&s;s did not hear; upon that the Sentinel turned round, and pointed his piece at the people oppo&s;ite to him. <HI>Langford</HI> &s;poke again, and told him there was no danger, the boys would not hurt him, and he &s;houldered. The witne&s;s con|tinued talking with the Sentry till the party came down, and then he went into the &s;treet. About this time <HI>Gray,</HI> one of the unhappy &s;ufferers, came and clapped <HI>Langford</HI> on the &s;houlder, &s;aying what's here to pay? <HI>Langford</HI> replies, I do not know, but &s;omething I believe will come of it by and by; his &s;tand was half way as he &s;aid betwixt the Sentry-box and <HI>Royal exchange-lane</HI>; the box being on the right corner of the lane, and he oppo&s;ite the center of the lane; the wit|ne&s;s and <HI>Gray</HI> were &s;tanding together talking familiarly, <HI>Langford</HI> leaning on his &s;tick, and <HI>Gray</HI> &s;tanding with his hands folded in his bo&s;om, without a &s;tick in his hand, nei|ther &s;aying or doing any thing to the &s;oldiers You can|not but recollect Gentlemen, that this witne&s;s was expre&s;sly and repeatedly a&s;ked, if <HI>Gray</HI> had a &s;tick, or &s;aid any thing to the &s;oldiers? he as often an&s;wered no. <HI>Langford</HI> &s;poke to <HI>Killroy,</HI> and after two guns were di&s;charged, &s;eeing him pre&s;ent his piece, &s;aid to him, damn you are you going to fire? Pre&s;ently upon this, <HI>Killroy</HI> levelled his piece, and firing directly at <HI>Gray,</HI> killed him dead on the &s;pot! The ball pa&s;&s;ed through his head, and he fell on <HI>Lang|ford</HI>'s left foot; upon which, not &s;atisfied with having mur|dered one of his fellow creatures in that cruel and inhu|man manner, he pu&s;hed with his bayonet, and pierced <HI>Lang|ford</HI> through his great coat and jacket; here Gentlemen, if any there can be, is evidence, and I think compleat evidence of a heart de&s;perately wicked, and bent upon mi&s;chief, the true characteri&s;tic of a wilful malicious murderer.</P>
<P>It could not be thought, at the di&s;tance the witne&s;s and <HI>Gray</HI> were &s;tanding from him, without offering any vio|lence, but <HI>Killroy</HI> the pri&s;oner &s;aw them di&s;tinctly, and ai|med to de&s;troy them; if you compare this te&s;timony with Mr. <HI>Hemmingway</HI>'s who &s;wears to <HI>Killroy</HI>'s uttering expre&s;|&s;ious importing, that he would mi&s;s no opportunity of fir|ing on the inhabitants, he had wi&s;hed for it ever &s;ince he landed, you certainly Gentlemen can have no doubt in your minds but that he had that intention at heart, and took this opportunity to execute it.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="011683_0030_0F87C841185B90B0">The crime of murder, Gentlemen, it will be agreed by all, nece&s;&s;arily involves in it the malice of the heart, and that malice is to be collected from the circum&s;tances atten|ding the action; but it is not nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute ma|lice, that it &s;hould be harboured long in the brea&s;t; a di&s;|tinction is made in the books betwixt malice and hatred, and a good di&s;tinction it is; I have it in my hand and will read it;</P>
<P>KELYNCE 126, and 127. MAWGRIDGE's CASE.
<Q>Some have been led into mi&s;take by not well con&s;idering what the pa&s;|&s;ion of malice is; they have con&s;trued it to be a rancour of mind lodged in the per&s;on killing, for &s;ome con&s;iderable time before the commi&s;&s;ion of the fact, which is a mi&s;take ari&s;ing from their not well di&s;tingui&s;hing between <HI>hatred</HI> and <HI>malice,</HI></Q>
And a little after,
<Q>Malice is a de&s;ign formed of doing mi&s;|chief to another; <HI>cum quis data opera male agit,</HI> he that de|&s;igns and u&s;eth the means to do ill is malicious: <HI>2 In&s;t. 42.</HI> He that doth a cruel act voluntarily, doth it of malice propen&s;|ed.</Q>
3 In&s;t. 62.</P>
<P>Though Gentlemen, it happens on a &s;udden occa&s;ion as this was, if the act is in it's nature wanton and cruel, the law will pre&s;ume it to be malicious, unle&s;s that pre&s;umption is taken off by contrary evidence.</P>
<P><HI>Ferriter,</HI> who te&s;tified to the &s;ame per&s;on, tells you, he was remarkably active at the Rope walks among&s;t the re&s;t of the &s;oldiers; taking therefore all the circum&s;tances of this te&s;timony together, it mu&s;t remove every &s;ort of diffi|culty in your minds as to the purpo&s;e <HI>Killroy</HI> had at that time; it &s;eems apparent that there were &s;trong marks of malice in his heart; the per&s;on you can have no doubt of, the fact you can have no doubt of, nor can you I think doubt of the &s;pecies of crime.</P>
<P>The next witne&s;s, who al&s;o te&s;tifies to <HI>Killroy</HI>'s going down, and being of the party, &s;wears that he was about twenty feet from the party when the fir&s;t gun was fired; that he al&s;o had been, previous to this, at <HI>Murray</HI>'s barracks, when the affray happened there, and tells you the behavi|our of the &s;oldiers in that &s;cene.</P>
<P><HI>Brewer,</HI> another witne&s;s al&s;o &s;wears to <HI>Killroy.</HI> He &s;aw the Sentinel on the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e</HI> &s;teps; at that time there were about twenty people, boys chiefly about fourteen, and &s;ome younger, round about him, but they made no great &s;how; he &s;aw the Captain come down with the
<PB N="59" REF="011683_0030_0F87C841185B90B0">
party, the Sentinel at this time had his gun brea&s;t high; that while the witne&s;s was &s;peaking to <HI>Monk,</HI> (a young lad who was wounded) he lo&s;t &s;ight of <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> and the guns went off: <HI>Monk</HI> complained of being &s;hot, but <HI>Brewer</HI> ap|prehended it was nothing but powder, and that he was more frightened than hurt; the firing began at the right and ex|tended to the corner man on the left. <HI>Killroy</HI> attacked this witne&s;s in the &s;ame manner <HI>M'Cauley</HI> did <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> by pu&s;hing at him with his bayonet; a number were collected by the ringing of the bells, but he heard nothing particular in re|gard to abu&s;ive language; he &s;aw no &s;now balls thrown, and when the &s;oldiers came down, he heard &s;ome of the people crying fire, and that was the general cry; &s;ome crying fire becau&s;e the bells rung, &s;ome, no doubt fire, to the &s;oldiers, daring them to it; but of this no great can be made in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. There were &s;even guns he &s;ays fired, he was certain as to the number, having counted them him&s;elf. He &s;ays further, he met Dr. <HI>Young</HI> in <HI>Dock-&s;quare</HI> and that he had a &s;word; the witne&s;s &s;aid, let every man go to his own home, and the Doctor replied, that is the be&s;t way, the &s;oldiers are gone to their barracks: per|haps &s;omething will be attempted to be made of this cir|cum&s;tance, and therefore I &s;hall make an ob&s;ervation upon it.&mdash;If you attend to the te&s;timony of &s;everal of the wit|ne&s;&s;es, there were that evening in the &s;treets at all parts of the town, a number of &s;oldiers; they failled out from <HI>Murray</HI>'s barracks and every where with clubs, cutla&s;&s;es, and other weapons of death; this occa&s;ioned a general alarm; every man therefore had a right, and very prudent it was to endea|vour to defend him&s;elf if attacked; this accounts for the rea&s;on of Dr. <HI>Young</HI> or any one inhabitant of the town having a &s;word that evening; the Doctor &s;urely could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any intention of mi&s;chief, becau&s;e the &s;ame witne&s;s tells you his cry was, the &s;oldiers were gone to their barracks, and go every man to his own home.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bailey</HI> the next witne&s;s, te&s;tifies as to the identity of &s;ome of the party, that there were <HI>Montgomery, Carrol</HI> and <HI>White</HI> there; that he placed him&s;elf at the po&s;t by the <HI>Cu&s;|tom-Hou&s;e,</HI> and &s;tood there all the time; that there were a|bout twenty boys, &s;ome fourteen years old, and &s;ome under that; he was near the Sentinel when the party came down; <HI>Carrol</HI> pointed at his brea&s;t with his bayonet, and <HI>White</HI> &s;aid do not hurt him; that <HI>Montgomery</HI> di&s;charged his piece fir&s;t;
<PB N="60" REF="011683_0031_0F87C8417828B198">
he thinks it was about half a minute before the &s;econd gun went off; the gren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dier's gun he &s;ays was &s;truck out of his hand by &s;ome per&s;on near him, and that he recovered it, and then fired; that <HI>Carrol</HI> was the next but one to him: he imagines Gentlemen, that <HI>Montgomery</HI> killed <HI>Attucks; Attucks</HI> was about fifteen feet from him over the gutter: He continued in his &s;tation at the corner from the time of the party's coming down till all was over; he did not ap|prehend him&s;elf or the &s;oldiers in danger, from clubs, &s;ticks, &s;now balls, or any thing el&s;e; he &s;aw the per&s;on that &s;truck <HI>Montgomery</HI> as he &s;uppo&s;ed, at the corner of <HI>Royal exchange-lane</HI>; he was a&s;ked if <HI>Attucks</HI> was the per&s;on, he an&s;wered no. From this witne&s;s you a&s;certain, Gentlemen, that <HI>Montgomery</HI> fired fir&s;t, and that he was on the right wing of the party.</P>
<P>The next witne&s;s is Mr. <HI>Palmes,</HI> he &s;aw the Sentry, and nobody near him: He had come from <HI>Murray</HI>'s barracks, and hearing a di&s;turbance in <HI>King-&s;treet,</HI> he was told he had better not go down, he &s;aid I will, and try to make peace; he <HI>al&s;o</HI> &s;aw <HI>Montgomery</HI> there; the &s;tick that &s;truck <HI>Mont|gomery</HI> was <HI>thrown</HI> as he apprehended; <HI>Montgomery</HI> &s;tept back and then fired; he thinks he heard &s;even or eight guns, but did not count them, and it was &s;even or eight &s;econds between the fir&s;t and &s;econd gun; as the la&s;t gun went off, <HI>Montgomery</HI> pu&s;hed at him with his bayonet, and he &s;truck him with his cane, and &s;truck the gun down; the bayonet &s;tuck in the &s;now, and the gun fell out of his hand; Mr. <HI>Palmes</HI> at this time &s;lipt and fell, but quickly recovered him&s;elf; <HI>Montgomery</HI> attempted again to pu&s;h him with his bayonet, and he threw his cane at him and run; not &s;atisfi|ed with this, <HI>Montgomery</HI> attempted to pu&s;h him a third time, and in that attempt he &s;lipt and fell, and thereby gave <HI>Palmes</HI> an opportunity to get out of his way, or el&s;e he &s;ays he had been run through the body; from the te&s;timony of this witne&s;s, you have further proof that <HI>Montgomery</HI> was the per&s;on who fired fir&s;t; that after firing, he continued to di&s;|cover marks of malice and malevolence, by pu&s;hing with his bayonet, and endeavouring to de&s;troy not only Mr. <HI>Palmes,</HI> but all around him.</P>
<P>Next comes Mr <HI>Danbrook,</HI> he &s;aw there <HI>Hartegan, Mont|gomery,</HI> and <HI>Carrol.</HI> Here is another witne&s;s to three of the party; it was about a quarter after nine when he came up; he &s;tood about ten or twelve feet from <HI>Montgomery;</HI> he &s;aw no

&s;tick &s;trke him, but a little &s;tick he &s;ays flew over their heads, which he took to be a piece of a rattan; he was look|ing on <HI>Montgomery</HI> when he fired; this is another evi|dence as to the fact of firing, upon which, the witne&s;s thinks, two men &s;ell: if that was the ca&s;e, there was exe|cution indeed; by the di&s;charge of one gun two per&s;ons killed on the &s;pot! He did not hear the &s;econd gun, but &s;up|po&s;es, that by one of the guns <HI>Attucks</HI> fell, he &s;tooped to &s;ee if the Molatto was dead, then turned round and &s;aw another man fall; <HI>Attucks</HI> at that time was near him, at his left, leaning on his &s;tick; that circum&s;tance I would have you keep in your minds Gentlemen, that you may remember it when you have the whole evidence together.</P>
<P><HI>Jedediah Ba&s;s</HI> is the next witne&s;s, he came up <HI>Royal ex|change-lane</HI>; when he got into <HI>King &s;treet,</HI> he &s;aw <HI>Montgo|mery</HI> there: here Gentlemen is another witne&s;s as to the iden|tity of one of the pri&s;oners, and the witne&s;s &s;aw him pu&s;h his bayonet at a man that &s;tood near him; he drew back into the lane, and in a minute <HI>Montgomery</HI> fired: the number of guns he took to be &s;ix, but did not count them: the people began on the firing of the fir&s;t gun to run, &s;ome one way and &s;ome another. As he came up <HI>Dock &s;quare,</HI> the people were &s;aying let us go home, there is no fire, the &s;oldiers are gone to their barracks.</P>
<P>After this witne&s;s comes Mr. <HI>Wilkin&s;on,</HI> who gave a very re|gular account; he tells you he was at his own hou&s;e when the bells rung for nine as u&s;ual; a little while after that he heard Dr. <HI>Cooper</HI>'s bell, on which apprehending it was for fire, he put on his &s;urrour, and went out; he came towards the <HI>Town-Hou&s;e,</HI> went pa&s;t it as far as the town-pump, and the people from the windows were cautioning tho&s;e in the &s;treet not to go down, for they would be killed; the night was &s;o bright that he was able where he was to &s;ee down the &s;treet as far as <HI>Boy&s;ton's alley,</HI> and there he &s;aw a number of &s;ol|diers &s;allying out, brandi&s;hing their &s;words, and contending with the people; there were about thirty or forty round them with buckets and bags, thinking as he &s;uppo&s;ed that the bells rung for fire; after this he went to the <HI>Guard-hou&s;e,</HI> intending to wait there, to learn if any mi&s;chief had been done at the barracks; he pre&s;ently &s;aw Capt. <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> come down, as he imagined from behind the <HI>Old Brick</HI> meeting-hou&s;e, and call to the guard, and ordered them to turn out; then he &s;aw the party come out, and &s;aw the <HI>Captain</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="011683_0032_0F87C84588AF09A8">
draw his &s;word and march down with them; at that time there were about thirty or forty people in <HI>King &s;treet</HI>; he went a little lower, and turned back again round the north &s;ide of the <HI>Town hou&s;e,</HI> and placed him&s;elf at the <HI>Royal-exchange-tavern</HI>; and the party was formed when he got there: he tells you he was not at all apprehen&s;ive of danger, con&s;e|quently he was capable of making ob&s;ervations, and placed him&s;elf in &s;uch a &s;ituation as to do it&punc; the party formed in a circle, and he &s;tood about four or five minutes, before he heard the word given to fire: that he heard it twice: on the fir&s;t command they did not fire; it was repeated, and then the guns went off one after another, like the &s;triking of a clock, he was about two yards from them and thinks the firing began at the right. This corre&s;ponds with the the te&s;timony of &s;everal witne&s;&s;es. He &s;aw the fla&s;h of each gun &s;even went off, and one fla&s;hed. There Gentlemen you have evidence of all the party's firing &s;ave one: the witne&s;s was a&s;ked if he &s;aw &s;now balls, ice, oy&s;ter &s;hells, or any thing el&s;e thrown by the people, to which he an&s;wered No; he &s;aid if he had, he &s;hould have thought him&s;elf in danger, and have retreated; he heard two or three cheers before the party came down, <HI>but none afterwards.</HI> Now, Gentle|men, if you recollect that circum&s;tance, and the manner of his relating it, you will remember he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf ve|ry emphatically: from this te&s;timony you have further ex|pre&s;s evidence of the fact of firing, that it came from the right, and from thence followed on to the left: he did not &s;ee the per&s;ons who were killed, therefore there is nothing in his evidence relating to that.</P>
<P>From the next witne&s;s, Mr. <HI>Simp&s;on,</HI> you have proof of <HI>White, Wemms, Warren,</HI> and <HI>Hartegan,</HI> four of the pri&s;oners, that they were all of the party that evening; and after re|lating a number of minute circum&s;tances, he &s;wears to the di&s;charge of eight guns, which if you give credit to his te&s;timony, will prove to you that the whole party fired; from him you have al&s;o further evidence of the killing <HI>At|tcks, Gray</HI> and <HI>Caldwell.</HI></P>

both before and after they formed; when the fir&s;t gun was fired, the &s;econd man from the right pu&s;hed his bayonet at him, and wounded him in the brea&s;t, you &s;aw Gentle|men the mark in Court: before this two different men pierced him in the arm and elbow quite to the bone; here Gentlemen were three thru&s;ts given to a per&s;on innocently pa&s;&s;ing down upon the cry of fire! he knew not as he &s;wears to you, what was the occa&s;ion of the party's coming down. The right hand Grenadler fell after he had fired, occa&s;ioned by pu&s;hing at a per&s;on who went down <HI>Royal-exchange-lane,</HI> this probably was Mr. <HI>Palmes,</HI> in who&s;e evidence if you re|member, you have this circum&s;tance related, that on his pu&s;hing at him the third time, <HI>Montgomery</HI>'s foot &s;lipped, which gave him an opportunity to e&s;cape down the lane.</P>
<P><HI>Hemmingway,</HI> the next witne&s;s, &s;wears, that being in com|pany with <HI>Killroy,</HI> he beard him &s;ay he never would mi&s;s an opportunity to fire on the people of the town, for he had wanted it ever &s;ince be landed; that <HI>Killroy</HI> was not then in liquor nor appeared to be in anger; he told him he was a fool, for &s;aying &s;o, he &s;aid I do not care, I will not mi&s;s an opportunity for all that; the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions Gentlemen &s;peak for them&s;elves, they are of &s;uch a nature as you can|not but draw from them the temper of the man's heart who &s;poke them, which you will con&s;ider at your lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hillier,</HI> came from the <HI>North end,</HI> was told there was no fire, but the &s;oldiers were in&s;ulting the inhabitants; a number of people in <HI>Dock &s;quare</HI> &s;eemed afraid to go up to <HI>King-&s;treet,</HI> another circum&s;tance which accounts for the ap|pearance of the inhabitants, at that time in <HI>Dock-&s;quare;</HI> the witne&s;s went up to <HI>King-&s;treet,</HI> &s;aw the Sentry with his bayo|net charged brea&s;t high, about twenty or thirty boys about him; he had often &s;een many more in that &s;treet in &s;uch a night as that was; it was bright moon light: the people on the party's coming down &s;eemed to collect in a body in <HI>Royal-exchange-lane</HI>; as he pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t man, he heard a gun from the right, thinks it was about twenty &s;econds be|fore the &s;econd gun fired; be ob&s;erved a little boy running a cro&s;s the &s;treet crying fire, and the left hand man followed the boy with his gun; there was nothing pa&s;&s;ed he ob&s;erved to induce them to apprehend any danger; he &s;ays, had even the &s;oldiers pointed at me, I &s;hould not have thought my|&s;elf in danger; he thinks there were &s;ix guns fired; he &s;aw no &s;now balls thrown, if there had been, he mu&s;t have

<P><HI>Nicholas Ferriter</HI> was next &s;worn, who knew <HI>Killroy</HI> and <HI>Warren</HI>; he &s;wears to their being at the Rope-walks before this affair happened; be relates the circum&s;tances of three &s;everal attacks in the Rope-walks, the fir&s;t was a &s;ingle per|&s;on who challenged him out to fight; a &s;qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble en&s;ued, and the &s;oldier took to his heels; he &s;oon collected a dozen more, came again, and had a farther battle, in which the &s;oldiers were again wor&s;ted; they then collected a large num|ber, to the amount of thirty, and in about three-quarters of an hour they came back, and went at it again; in this la&s;t &s;quabble the &s;oldiers were a third time wor&s;ted. From this affair perhaps may be dated a good deal of the proceed|ings of the Monday-evening; you have heard from the witne&s;&s;es that the &s;oldiers of that regiment, remembered the grudge, and di&s;covered a malicious di&s;po&s;ition; were frequently &s;een in parties, and when &s;ingle, with arms, attacking the people pa&s;&s;ing the &s;treets. <HI>Killroy</HI> one of the pri&s;oners, and <HI>Warren,</HI> are expre&s;sly &s;worn to, that they were in this affray; <HI>Gray</HI> and <HI>Ferriter</HI> went into <HI>King-&s;treet, Gray</HI> had no &s;tick; <HI>Ferriter</HI> left <HI>Gray</HI> in <HI>King-&s;treet</HI>; it appears he did not go down with a di&s;po&s;ition to commit any a&s;&s;ault at all.</P>
<P><HI>Burdick</HI> is the next witne&s;s, he &s;ays when he came down to <HI>King-&s;treet</HI> he &s;poke to a &s;oldier, he thinks it was <HI>Montgo|mery,</HI> he a&s;ked him if he was loaded and intended to fire; yes, by the eternal God! was the an&s;wer he received.&mdash; The intention of that &s;oldier, whoever he was, you clearly di&s;cover; the witne&s;s thinks it was <HI>Montgomery</HI>; he &s;ays further, a &s;oldier pu&s;hed at him with his bayonet, and he &s;truck his gun; he &s;aw nothing flung but a &s;mall &s;tick, which hit nobody; as he was &s;tooping to take up the dead, they cocked their guns and pre&s;ented at him again; thus you &s;ee the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition continued, they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iming to pu&s;h at every body round about them; and after they had killed the&s;e per&s;ons, they were not &s;atisfied with that but attempted to pu&s;h tho&s;e that were taking them away.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> who was next &s;worn, hath nothing material in his te&s;timony, but that of the guns following the peo|ple as they ran after the fir&s;t gun was fired; that &s;even
<PB N="65" REF="011683_0033_0F87C84612D8DC10">
guns were fired, that he &s;aw no &s;ticks or &s;now balls fall near them, that all the &s;now balls he did &s;ee &s;eemed to be light, and not hard.</P>
<P>It has been a&s;ked from the bench, Whether there may not be voluntary man&s;laughter? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">readily grant there may; it has al&s;o been ob&s;erved, that homicide which includes murder, mu&s;t be committed with coolne&s;s and deliberation, I allow it, and my application of this rule, is, that it comes within the evidence you have of the particular facts related by the witne&s;&s;es with regard to <HI>Killroy</HI>; there is no manner of doubt with me, but the fact was done in the manner which the law calls <HI>&s;edato animo</HI>; he was doing a deliberate action, with a cool and calm mind; it appears, if you believe <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g|ford,</HI> he was not mole&s;ted; it appears the per&s;on he killed, and at whom he aimed, and the per&s;on who&s;e cloths he pierced with his bayonet, were &s;tanding peaceably, one leaning on a &s;tick, and the other with his arms folded.</P>
<P>After the witne&s;&s;es we have gone through, a number of gentlemen were examined, mo&s;t of whom lived in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> who have te&s;tifyed to the conduct of the &s;oldiers, that even|ing the affair happened.</P>
<P>I will not take them in order, for I apprehend, by recur|ing to Colonel <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> fir&s;t, the re&s;t will come in more na|turally; he &s;ays, he came from Colonel <HI>Jack&s;on</HI>'s in <HI>Dock-&s;quare,</HI> about a quarter after nine o'clock; that the &s;treet was quite &s;till, no body pa&s;&s;ing thro' <HI>Dock &s;quare</HI>; he came up to his own hou&s;e next the <HI>Cu&s;tom hou&s;e,</HI> he pa&s;&s;ed the Sen|tinel, and there was no body near him; <HI>King-&s;treet</HI> was quite &s;till, fewer people pa&s;&s;ing than he had u&s;ually &s;een on &s;uch a fine night; he went into his own hou&s;e, and &s;oon after heard a di&s;tant cry of murder, what part of the &s;treet it came from he did not know: He, gentlemen, you will remember, intimated al&s;o this circum&s;tance, that he had been warned not to go out that evening; this gave him an apprehen&s;ion there was &s;ome mi&s;chief to be betwixt the &s;ol|diers and the inhabitants; he mentioned it to the per&s;on in the &s;trop, and went out; looking towards the <HI>Guard-hou&s;e,</HI> he &s;aw a number of &s;oldiers i&s;&s;ue from thence in an undre&s;s, with naked &s;words, cutla&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> crying out "Damn them where are they? By Je&s;us let 'em come." As to the &s;itua|tion of the Moon, whether &s;he was north or &s;outh, which has been much altercated, I cannot &s;ee it will make much one way or the other, it is &s;ufficient that Colonel <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI>

who&s;e credibility and capacity will not be di&s;puted, has &s;worn that from his door he ob&s;erved a party of &s;oldiers come down in undre&s;s, armed with cutla&s;&s;es and other wea|pons, the cutla&s;&s;es he &s;wears he particularly &s;aw glittering in the Moon light; the expre&s;&s;ions he &s;aid he plainly heard, while they were brandi&s;hing their &s;words; when this party pa&s;&s;ed off, he &s;aw a &s;econd party come up <HI>Quaker-lane,</HI> arm|ed in the &s;ame manner, and making u&s;e of the &s;ame kind of language, and that party he &s;aid cried fire; in his te&s;ti|mony on the trial of Captain <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> he &s;aid the bells rung on that cry; he expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome doubt of this ye&s;terday, but it was certainly ju&s;t about that time; the u&s;e I would make of this is, to compare it with what the other witne&s;&s;es &s;ay of the conduct of the &s;oldiers in <HI>Cornhill</HI>; as Mr. <HI>Thayer</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;es it, it is probable the word fire was a watch-word; it appears to me, that if we can believe the evidence, they had a de&s;ign of attacking and &s;laughtering the inhabitants that night, and they could have devi&s;ed no better method to draw out the inhabitants unarmed, than to cry fire!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thayer,</HI> was &s;itting at his fire, in <HI>Corn-hill,</HI> near <HI>Boyl&s;ton</HI>'s <HI>alley,</HI> he heard a great noi&s;e, and went to the door, he &s;aw &s;even &s;oldiers in an undre&s;s coming down like wild creatures, with cutla&s;&s;es in their hands, crying damn them, where are they? upon this he heard a cry of fire, and &s;uppo&s;ed it to be a watch-word.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Kneeland,</HI> who lives by the town-pump, came out and &s;tood at his door; &s;aw a number of &s;oldiers pa&s;s by him armed; one of them came up to him and &s;aid, damn you what do you do here? and pointed his bayonet to his brea&s;t, telling him to go in.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Appleton</HI> who lived oppo&s;ite, tells you he was &s;tanding by his neighbour Mr. <HI>Mar&s;h,</HI> they were both at the door; a number of &s;oldiers came running down, armed with cutla&s;&s;es, in an undre&s;s, and they &s;eemed to come out of their way, (ob&s;erving them at the door) with uplifted weapons, intending as it appeared, to &s;trike them: but they fortunately got into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> doors.</P>
<P>Then gentlemen, comes the &s;on of Mr. <HI>Appleton,</HI> the young ma&s;ter who was &s;worn ye&s;terday, who&s;e &s;tory, with his manner of telling it, mu&s;t &s;trike deep into your minds; I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ure it did in mine; a child of his age, with a younger brother &s;ent of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> errand a few &s;teps, and on returning home, &s;truck at by a party of &s;oldiers, nay ruffians, with

cutla&s;&s;es, he innocently crying, &s;oldiers &s;pare my life! No damn you we will kill you all, or words to that purpo&s;e, at|tended with a blow, was the an&s;wer the little victim re|ceived! what can indicate malice if this does not? cruelty almo&s;t equal to that of a <HI>Pharoh</HI> or <HI>Herod.</HI> I remember at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t tryal, my brother <HI>Adams</HI> made this ob&s;ervation, that "Man is a &s;ocial creature, that his feelings, his pa&s;|&s;ions, his imaginations are contagious," I am &s;ure if in any in&s;tance it is &s;o, here was food enough for &s;uch pa&s;&s;i|ons, &s;uch imaginations to feed upon.</P>
<P>But Gentlemen, as it does not immediately relate to the pri|&s;oners, all the u&s;e I mean to make of it is, to &s;how you that from the conduct and appearance of the &s;oldiery, in diffe|rent parts of the town, the inhabitants had rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive they were in danger of their lives; children and parents, hu&s;bands and wives, ma&s;ters and &s;ervants, had rea&s;on to tremble one for another. This apprehen&s;ion, together with the ringing of the bells, collected numbers of people in different quarters, as is commonly the ca&s;e when there is any appearance of fire; and the center of the town, when there is a doubt where fire is, becomes naturally the place of rendezvouz: this accounts for the number of people that were there, and for &s;ome having &s;ticks and canes. I mention this only to take off the force of any evidence or pretence that may be made, that there was an intention of the people to a&s;&s;ault, or as it has been expre&s;&s;ed, &s;wallow up the &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>I have now gone through the evidence on the part of the Crown, in &s;upport of the charge again&s;t the pri&s;oners, I &s;hall make a very few ob&s;ervations, and leave it with the pri&s;oners and their Council to make their defence, and Mr. <HI>Paine</HI> who is on the &s;ide of the Crown with me, to clo&s;e the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I think Gentlemen upon the whole evidence, you can, in the fir&s;t place, have no doubt but that all the pri&s;oners at the bar were of that party of &s;oldiers, headed by Capt. <HI>Pre&s;|ton,</HI> who went down to the <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e,</HI> on the 5th. <HI>March,</HI> the evening mentioned in the indictments; that the five per&s;ons named in tho&s;e indictments were killed by &s;ome or other of that party, but who they were that killed tho&s;e &s;e|veral per&s;ons, may not be preci&s;ely a&s;certained, except in the ca&s;e of <HI>Killroy,</HI> again&s;t whom I think you have certain evidence.</P>
<P>It is a rule of law Gentlemen, when the fact of killing is
<PB N="68" REF="011683_0035_0F87C8475D1CBA70">
once proved, every circum&s;tance alleviating, excu&s;ing, or ju&s;tifying, in order to extenuate the crime mu&s;t be proved by the pri&s;oners, for the law pre&s;umes the fact malicious, untill the contrary appears in evidence.</P>
<P>There is another rule I &s;hall mention al&s;o, and that is, that it is imaterial, where there are a number of per&s;ons concerned, who gave the mortal blow, all that are pre&s;ent, are in the eye of the law, principals. This is a rule &s;ettled by the Judges of <HI>England</HI> upon &s;olid argument. The que&s;|tion therefore then will be, what &s;pecies of homicide this is? and the deci&s;ion of that que&s;tion mu&s;t be deferred, un|till the defence comes out by the evidence on the other &s;ide</P>
<P>The laws of &s;ociety, Gentlemen, lay a re&s;traint on the pa&s;|&s;ions of men, that no man &s;hall be the avenger of his own cau&s;e, unle&s;s through ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, the law giving a remedy for every wrong: If a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> might at any time ex|ecute his own revenge, there would be and end of law.</P>
<P>A per&s;on cannot ju&s;tify killing, if he can by any means make his e&s;cape; he &s;hould endeavour to take him&s;elf out of the way, before he kills the per&s;on attacking him.</P>
<P><HI>Here one of the Court judging it improper for the Council in o|pening the cau&s;e to anticipate the defence, and this being determi|ned by the whole Bench, Mr Quincy then clo&s;ed, with &s;aying.</HI></P>
<P>I was about to make &s;ome farther remarks, but it is thought by the Honourable Court improper to anticipate what may be urged on the other &s;ide. I &s;hall therefore re&s;t the ca&s;e as it is, and doubt not but on the evidence as it now &s;tands, the facts, as far as we have gone, again&s;t the pri&s;o|ners at the bar, are fully proved, and until &s;omething turns up to remove from your minds, the force of that evidence, you mu&s;t pronounce them <HI>GUILTY.</HI></P>

<P>Before we enter upon the&s;e enquiries, permit me, Gen|tlemen, to remind you of the importance of this trial, as it relates to the pri&s;oners &mdash;It is for their lives!

It is tedious and painful to at|tend &s;o lengthy a trial; but remember the time which has been taken up by the Crown, in the opening. By every bond of humanity and ju&s;tice, we claim an equal indul|gence: pay, it is of high importance to your country, that nothing &s;hould appear on this trial to impeach our ju&s;|tice, or &s;tain our humanity.</P>
<P>And here, let me remind you of a notion, which has certainly been too prevalent, and guard you again&s;t it's baneful influence. An opinion has been entertained by many among us, that the life of <HI>a &s;oldier,</HI> was of very lit|tle value: of much le&s;s value, than others of the commu|nity.&mdash;The law Gentlemen, knows no &s;uch di&s;tinction;&mdash; the life of a &s;oldier is viewed by the equal eye of the law, as e&s;timable, as the life of any other citizen.</P>
<P>I cannot any other way account, for what I mention, but by &s;uppo&s;ing, that the indigence and poverty of a &s;oldier,&mdash; the toils of his life,&mdash;the &s;everity of di&s;cipline to which he is expo&s;ed,&mdash;the precarious tenure by which he is general|ly thought to hold his life, in the &s;ummary deci&s;ions of a court-martial, have con&s;pired to propagate a &s;entiment of this kind; but a little attention to the human heart, will di&s;&s;ipate this notion.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier takes his choice, like all others, of his cour&s;e of life:&mdash;he has an equal right, with you or me, &s;o to do. It is be&s;t we &s;hould not all think alike. Habit makes all things agreeable. What at fir&s;t was irk&s;ome, &s;oon becomes plea&s;ing. But does experience teach, that mi&s;ery begen in general an hatred of life.

<P>How ought we all, who are to bear a part in this day, to aim at a &s;trick adherence to the principles of this law&mdash;how ought we all to aim at utterly eradicating every undue bi|a&s;s of the judgment&mdash;a bias &s;ubver&s;ive of all ju&s;tice and hu|manity.</P>
<P>Another opinion equally foreign to truth and law has been adopted by many.</P>
<P>It has been thought, that no po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e could happen, in which a &s;oldier could fire, without the aid of a civil magi&s;trate. This is a great mi&s;take&mdash;a very unhappy mi&s;|take indeed!&mdash;one, I am afraid, that had it's influence, on the fatal night, which we all lament. The law, <HI>as to the pre&s;ent point,</HI> puts the citizen and &s;oldier under <HI>equal</HI> re|&s;traint. What will ju&s;tify and mitigate the action or the one, will do the &s;ame to the other.&mdash; Let us bear this in|variable in mind, in examining the evidence. But before we proceed to this examination, let us take a tran&s;ient view of &s;ome occurences, proceding and &s;ub&s;equent to the melan|choly fifth of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>About &s;ome five or &s;ix years ago, it is well known, cer|tain mea&s;ures were adopted by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parliament, which gave a general alarm to this continent. Mea&s;ures were al|ternately taken, in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that awakened jea|lo&s;y, re&s;entment, fortitude and vigilance.&mdash;Affairs continu|ed long &s;tactuating. A &s;entiment univer&s;al prevailed, that our deare&s;t rights were invaded. It is not our bu&s;ine&s;s here to enquire touching the&s;e delicate points. The&s;e are con|cernments, which however intere&s;ting or important in them&s;elves, we mu&s;t keep far away from us, when in a Court of law. It poi&s;ons ju&s;tice, when politics tinctures it's current.</P>
<P>I need not inform you, how the tide ro&s;e, as we were ad|vancing towards the pre&s;ent times. The general atten|tion became more and more rou&s;ed people became more a like in opinion and practice. A va&s;t majority thought all

that was dear was at &s;take&mdash;&s;entiments of liberty&mdash;proper|ty&mdash;ignominious bondage&mdash;all con&s;pire to encrea&s;e the fer|ment.&mdash;At this period, the troops land.&mdash;Let us here pau&s;e, and view the citizen and &s;oldier.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es of grievance being thus &s;pread far and wide, the inhabitants viewed the &s;oldiery as called in, foreign from their prime in&s;titution, to force obedience to acts, which were, in general, deemed &s;ubver&s;ive of natural, as well as con&s;titutional freedom. With regard to the univer&s;al pre|valence of ideas of this kind, it does not fall within our pre&s;ent plan, to give you direct, po&s;itive evidence. It would be too foreign to the pre&s;ent i&s;&s;ue, though pertinent enough, when con&s;idered as a clue to &s;prings and motives of action, and as an additional aid to form a ju&s;t judgement in our pre|&s;ent enquiry. You Gentlemen who come from the body of the county, are pre&s;umed to know the&s;e facts, if they are true; nay their notoriety mu&s;t be &s;uch, provided I am not mi&s;taken in my conjecture, that the ju&s;tice of my ob&s;erva|tion on this matter, mu&s;t be certainly confirmed by your own experience. I pre&s;ume not in this, or any other mat|ter of fact, to pre&s;cribe to you; if the&s;e &s;entiments are wrong, they ought to have no influence; if right, they ought certainly to have their due weight.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, Gentlemen, and appeal to you for the truth of what I &s;ay, that many on this continent viewed their chains as already forged, they &s;aw fetters as prepared, they be|held the &s;oldiers as fa&s;tening, and riveting for ages, the &s;hackles of their bondage. With the ju&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s of the&s;e ap|prehen&s;ions, you and I have nothing to do in this place. Di&s;qui&s;itions of this &s;ort, are for the Senate, and the Cham|ber of Council&mdash;they are for &s;tate&s;men and politicians who take a latitude in thoughts and actions; but we. Gen|tlemen, are confined in our excur&s;ions, by the rigid rules of law.&mdash;Upon the <HI>real, actual</HI> exi&s;tence of the&s;e apprehen|&s;ions, in the community, we may judge&mdash;they are <HI>facts</HI> fal|ling properly within on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cognizance&mdash;and hitherto may we go, but no further.

<P>Matters being thus circum&s;tanced, what might be ex|pected. No room was left for cordiality and friend&s;hip.

Di&s;content was &s;eated on almo&s;t every brow. In&s;tead of that ho&s;pitality, that the &s;oldier thought him&s;elf intitled to, &s;corn, contempt and &s;ilent murmurs were his recepti|on. Almo&s;t every countenance lowered with a di&s;coutent|ed gloom, and &s;carce an eye, but fla&s;hed indignant fire.</P>
<P>Turn and contemplate the camp. Do we find a more fa|vourable appearance?</P>
<P>The &s;oldier had his feelings, his &s;entiments, and his cha|racteri&s;tick pa&s;&s;ions al&s;o. The con&s;titution of our govern|ment has provided a &s;timulus for his affections.&mdash;The pride of con&s;cious virtue, the &s;en&s;e of valour, the <HI>point of honour.</HI></P>
<P>The law had taught him to think favourably of him&s;elf. Had taught him to con&s;ider him&s;elf,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Black&s;tone's Commentaries, Vol. I. p. 407.</NOTE> as peculiarly appoint|ed for the &s;afeguard and defence of his country. He had heard, that he put not off the citizen, when he entered the camp; but becau&s;e he was a citizen, and wi&s;hed to conti|nue &s;o, he made him&s;elf for a while a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>How &s;tinging was it to be &s;tigmatized, as the in&s;tru|ment of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion? how exa&s;perating to be viewed, as aiding to enthrall his country? He felt his heart glow with an ardour, which <HI>he</HI> took for a love of liberty and his country, and had formed to him&s;elf no de&s;ign fa|tal to it's privileges. He recollected no doubt, that he had heretofore expo&s;ed him&s;elf for it's &s;ervice. He had bared his bo&s;om in defence of his native &s;oil, and as yet felt the &s;ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of wounds received in conflict for his King and Coun|try. Could that &s;pirit, which had braved the &s;hafts of fo|reign battle, brook the keener wounds of civil conte&s;t?&mdash; The arrows which now pierced him, pierced as deep, and rankled more, than tho&s;e of former times. Is it rational to imagine much harmony could long &s;ub&s;i&s;t?</P>
<P>We mu&s;t take human nature as we find it, and not vainly imagine, that all things are to become new, at &s;uch a cri&s;is.</P>
<P>There are an order of men in every commonwealth who never rea&s;on, but always act from feelings. That their rights and liberties were filched away one after another, they had often been told. They had been taught, by tho&s;e whom they believed, that the ax was now laid to the root of the tree, and one more &s;troke compleated it's fall. It was in vain to expect to &s;ilence or &s;ubdue the&s;e emotions by rea&s;ons, &s;oothings, or dangers. A belief, that nothing
<PB N="74" REF="011683_0038_0F87C84AAF7D5170">
could be wor&s;e than the calamities which &s;eemed inevita|ble, had extended it&s;elf on all &s;ides, and arguments drawn from &s;uch &s;ources had little influence. Each day gave ri&s;e to now occurrences which encrea&s;ed animo&s;ities. Heart-burn|ings, heats and bickerings became more and more exten&s;ive. Reciprocal in&s;ults lowered the temper, mutual injuries im|bittered the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Can we wonder, that when every thing tended to &s;ome important action, the period &s;o &s;oon arrived? Will not our wonder be encrea&s;ed, to find the cri&s;is no &s;ooner taking place, when &s;o many circum&s;tances united to ha&s;ten it's ap|proach? To u&s;e an allu&s;ion &s;omewhat homely, may we not wonder, that the <HI>acid</HI> and the <HI>alcali,</HI> did not &s;ooner fer|ment?</P>
<P>A thought here imperceptibly forces it&s;elf on our minds, and we are led to be a&s;toni&s;hed, that per&s;ons &s;o di&s;cordant in opinion, &s;o oppo&s;ite in views, attachments and con|nections, &s;hould be &s;tationed together. But here, Gentle|men, <HI>we mu&s;t &s;top.</HI> If we pur&s;ue this enquiry, at this time, and in this place, we &s;hall be in danger of doing great in|ju&s;tice. We &s;hall get beyond our limits. The right of quartering troops in this province mu&s;t be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed at a dif|ferent tribunal. The <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> legality, the propriety, the expediency of their appointment are que&s;tions of &s;tate, not to be determined, nor even agitated by us, in this Court. It is enough for us, if the law takes notice of them when thus &s;tationed; if it warrants their continuance; If it protects them in their quarters. They were &s;ent here by that authority, which our laws know; they were quarter|ed here, as I take it, agreeable to an act of the Briti&s;h Par|liament; they were ordered here, by your Sovereign, and mine. I expect hereafter, to be more particular on this head.</P>
<P>Let me here take a method very common, with another order of men. Let me remind you of what is <HI>not</HI> your duty.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, great pains have been taken by different men, with very different views, to involve the character, the con|duct and reputation of the town of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in the pre&s;ent i&s;&s;ue. <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and it's inhabitants have no more to do with this cau&s;e, than you or any other members of the community. You are, therefore, by no means to blend two things, &s;o e&s;|&s;entially different, as the guilt or innocence of this town
<PB N="75" REF="011683_0038_0F87C84AAF7D5170">
and the pri&s;oners, together. The inhabitants of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> by no rules of law&punc; ju&s;tice of common &s;en&s;e, can be &s;uppo&s;ed an&s;werable for the unju&s;tifiable conduct of a few individu|als ha&s;tily a&s;&s;embled in the &s;treets. Every populous city, in like circum&s;tances, would be liable to &s;imilar commoti|ons, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not wor&s;e.

Who can, who will, unnece&s;|&s;arily intere&s;t them&s;elves, to ju&s;tify the rude behaviour of a mixt and ungovernable multitude? May I not appeal to you, and all who have heard this trial, thus far, that things already wear a different a&s;pect from what we have been, heretofore, taught to expect? Had any one told you &s;ome weeks ago, that the evidence on the Crown-&s;ide, would have appeared in it's pre&s;ent light, would you have believ|ed it? Can any one think it his duty, to e&s;pou&s;e the part acted, by tho&s;e a&s;&s;embled in <HI>King-&s;treet?</HI>&mdash;I think not, but le&s;t my opinion &s;hould not have any weight, let me remind you of an author, whom, I tru&s;t, and wi&s;h in the hands of all of you. One whom I tru&s;t you will credit. I am &s;ure you ought to love and rev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re him. I wi&s;h his &s;entiments were ingraven in indelible characters on your hearts. You will not &s;u&s;pect him of being unfriendly to liberty; if this cau&s;e and it's event mu&s;t, at all hazards, be held as interwo|ven with a matter &s;o foreign to it. I allude to the third Letter of the FARMER of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to his countrymen.</P>
<P><Q>The cau&s;e of liberty, &s;ays, that great and good wri|ter, is a cau&s;e of too much dignity, to be fullied by tur|bulence and tumult. It ought to be maintained in a man|ner &s;uitable to her nature. Tho&s;e who engage in it, &s;hould breathe a <HI>&s;edate,</HI> yet <HI>fervent &s;pirit,</HI> animating them to actions of <HI>prudence, ju&s;tice, mode&s;ty, bravery, humanity,</HI> and magnanimity.</Q></P>
<P>What has there tran&s;pired on this trial, &s;avouring of any of the&s;e virtues? Was it <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> or <HI>humanity</HI> to attack, in|&s;ult, ridicule and abu&s;e a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> Sentinel on his po&s;t? Was it either <HI>mode&s;t, brave</HI> or <HI>magnanimous</HI> to ru&s;h upon the points of fixed bayonets; and trifle, vapour, and provoke at the very mouths of loaded mu&s;kets. It may be brutal rage, or wanton ra&s;hne&s;s, but not &s;urely any true magna|nimity.</P>

<P>By this it &s;hould &s;eem, as though the Farmer never ex|pected <HI>any period</HI> would arrive, when <HI>&s;uch mea&s;ures</HI> would be warrantable.

What more <HI>di&s;re&s;pectful</HI> of <HI>our common &s;overeign,</HI> than to a&s;&s;ume the &s;word of ju&s;tice, and become the avengers of either public or private wrongs? Tho' the &s;oldiers, who appeared in the earlier part of the evening, in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> acted like barbarians and &s;avages, they had now retired, and were now confined in their barracks: what tho' an impertinent boy had received unju&s;tifiable cor|rection from the Sentinel; the boy, and the per&s;ons in <HI>Corn|hill,</HI> mu&s;t have recour&s;e only to the law for their redre&s;s.

Thus have you the &s;en&s;e of this great authority <HI>with us.</HI> And let me a&s;k all tho&s;e, who have thought the cau&s;e of their country connected with the agents of the a&s;&s;embly in <HI>King-&s;treet,</HI> whether the <HI>proceedings</HI> of that unhappy night, were <HI>hot, ra&s;h,</HI> or <HI>di&s;orderly?</HI> If they were, have they not, in the opinion of this great friend of liber|ty, <HI>injured</HI> our reputation, as to <HI>wi&s;dom, valour,</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI>; and that too, without procuring the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> benefit? Who then would &s;acrifice his judgment and his integrity, to vin|dicate <HI>&s;uch</HI> proceedings?</P>
<P>To what purpo&s;es the &s;oldiers were &s;ent; whether it was a &s;tep warranted by &s;ound policy or not, we &s;hall not enquire; we are to con&s;ider the troops, not as the in&s;tru|ments for wre&s;ting our rights, but as fellow citizens, who being to be tried by a law, extending to every individual, claim a part in it's benefits&mdash;it's privileges&mdash;it's mercy. We
<PB N="77" REF="011683_0039_0F87C84B1C5B9908">
mu&s;t &s;teel our&s;elves again&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, which contaminate the fountain of ju&s;tice. We ought to recollect, that our pre&s;ent deci&s;ions will be &s;cann'd, perhaps thro' all Europe. We mu&s;t not forget, that we our&s;elves will have a reflective hour&mdash;an hour, in which we &s;hall view things through a different medium&mdash;when the pul&s;e will no longer beat with the tumults of the day&mdash;when the con&s;cious pang of having betrayed truth, ju&s;tice, and integrity, &s;hall bite like a &s;erpent and &s;ting like an adder.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, Gentlemen, the danger which you, and all of us are in, of being led away by our affections and attach|ments.&mdash;We have &s;een the blood of our fellow men flow|ing in the &s;treets. We have been told that this blood was <HI>wrongfully</HI> &s;hed. That is now the point in i&s;&s;ue. But let it be borne deep upon our minds, that the pri&s;oners are to be condemned by the evidence <HI>here in Court</HI> produced again&s;t them, and by nothing el&s;e. Matters heard or &s;een abroad, are to have no weight: in general they undermine the pil|lars of ju&s;tice and truth. It has been our misfortune, that a &s;y&s;tem of evidence has appeared in the world again&s;t us. It is not our bu&s;ine&s;s to blame any one for this. It is our misfortune, I &s;ay. It &s;hould be remembered, that we were not pre&s;ent to cro&s;s examine: and the danger which re&s;ults from having this publication in the hands of tho&s;e who are to pa&s;s upon our lives, ought to be guarded again&s;t. We &s;ay we are innocent, by our plea, and are not to be de|nounced guilty upon a new &s;pecies of evidence, unknown in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;y&s;tem of criminal law.</P>
<P>But as though a &s;eries of <HI>ex parte</HI> evidence was not enough, all the colours of the canva&s;s have been touched in order to fre&s;hen the wounds, and by a tran&s;port of imagination, we are made pre&s;ent at the &s;cene of action. The prints ex|hibited in our hou&s;es have added wings to fancy, and in the fervour of our zeal, rea&s;on is in hazard of being lo&s;t. For as was elegantly expre&s;&s;ed, by a learned Gentleman at the late trial, "The pa&s;&s;ions of man, nay his very imaginations are contagious." The pomp of funeral, the horrors of death have been &s;o delineated, as to give a &s;pring to our ideas, and in&s;pire a glow incompatible with &s;ound, deli|berative judgment. In this &s;ituation, every pa&s;&s;ion has alternately been predominant. They have each in it's turn, &s;ub&s;ided, in degree, and they have &s;ometimes given place to de&s;pondence, grief and &s;orrow. How careful &s;hould
<PB N="78" REF="011683_0040_0F87C84E940F0A50">
we be, that we do not mi&s;take the impre&s;&s;ions of gloom and melancholy, for the dictates of rea&s;on and truth. How careful, le&s;t borne away by a torrent of pa&s;&s;ion, we make &s;hip|wreck of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Perhaps, you may be told. Gentlemen, as I remember it was &s;aid, at the late trial, that pa&s;&s;ions were like the flux and re&s;tux of the &s;ea&mdash;the highe&s;t tides always producing the lowe&s;t ebbs. But let it be noticed, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de, in our political ocean, has yet never turned; certainly the cur|rent has never &s;et towards the oppo&s;ite quarter. However &s;imilies may illu&s;trate, they never go for proof. &mdash;Though I believe, that it will be found, that if the tide of re&s;ent|ment has <HI>not</HI> ri&s;en of late, it has been becau&s;e, it had reach|ed the &s;ummit.&mdash;In the &s;ame mode of phra&s;eology, if &s;o homely an expre&s;&s;ion may be u&s;ed; perhaps, as the &s;eam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;ay, it has been high-water &s;lack&mdash;but I am &s;atisfied the current has not as yet altered it's cour&s;e, in favour of the pri&s;oners at the bar.</P>
<P>Many things yet exi&s;t &s;ufficient to keep alive the glow of indignation. I have aimed at &s;ecuring you again&s;t the catching flame. I have endeavoured to di&s;charge my duty, in this re&s;pect:&mdash;What &s;ucce&s;s will follow tho&s;e endeavours, depends on you, Gentlemen. If being told of your dan|ger will not produce caution, nothing will. If you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e de|termined in opinion, it is in vain to &s;ay more, but if you are zealous enquirers after truth; if you are willing to hear with impartiality&mdash;to examine and judge for your&s;elves&mdash; enough has been &s;aid to apprize you of tho&s;e avenues, at which the enemies of truth and ju&s;tice are mo&s;t likely to enter&mdash;and mo&s;t ea&s;ily to be&s;et you.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now, <HI>for argument's &s;ake only,</HI> take it for granted, that <HI>the fact of killing,</HI> had been proved upon all the pri&s;on|ers: you are &s;en&s;ible this is not really true; for as to this point, there are &s;everal of the pri&s;oners upon whom this <HI>fact</HI> is not fixed. But as I &s;hall hereafter take occa&s;ion to con&s;ider the di&s;tinct ca&s;e of each pri&s;oner, as he is affected by the evidence, I at pre&s;ent chu&s;e to avoid confu&s;ion, and apply my&s;elf to the full &s;trength of the crown; and, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that <HI>all</HI> the pri&s;oners were an&s;werable for <HI>the act</HI> of <HI>any</HI> one, &s;ee how the pri&s;oners are chargeable, by the evidence already offered, with the crime of <HI>Murder:</HI>&mdash;or rather endeavour to point out to you tho&s;e facts, appear|ing

Without taking up time, in attending and di&s;cu&s;&s;ing points, no way pertinent to the pre&s;ent i&s;&s;ue; without a tedious recapitulation of cir|cum&s;tances, with which, I take it, we have no more con|cern, than either of you, Gentlemen; I &s;ay pa&s;&s;ing over all the&s;e matters as foreign to <HI>this</HI> trial:&mdash;let us &s;tate evi|dence appearing even from the crown witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e witne&s;&s;es, (who&s;e te&s;timony I &s;hall not con&s;ider in the order they were produced) inform you, that in the former part of the evening a number of &s;oldiers ru&s;hed from &s;ome of the lanes near the <HI>Guard hou&s;e,</HI> or as Col. <HI>Mar|&s;hall</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, from the <HI>Guard hou&s;e</HI> it&s;elf. But &s;ome circum|&s;tances he relates, as to their dre&s;s, may render it doubtful, whether he is right in this point. Soldiers on guard have a peculiar regimental habiliment, which they never dare put off; and if I am rightly in&s;tructed, no &s;oldiers, but tho&s;e on duty, are &s;uffered to be at the <HI>Guard-hou&s;e</HI> at tho&s;e hours. However thus much is certain, that being dre&s;&s;ed in &s;hort jackets or working coa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, proves them not to be of that particular party who had mounted guard at this time.</P>
<P>The cry was "where are they&mdash;damn them where are they!" They brandi&s;h their weapons, and proceed to <HI>Corn-hill.</HI> What tho&s;e weapons were the witne&s;&s;es &s;ay differently. But it &s;hould be mentioned, as we go along, that the &s;oldiers of the twenty-ninth, are never allowed to wear &s;words or cutla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As the&s;e &s;oldiers pa&s;s down <HI>Corn-hill,</HI> they a&s;&s;ualt, abu&s;e and attack people. The &s;oldiers in their turn are beaten. One has his wri&s;t broke&mdash;and the general cry &s;oon after was&mdash; "they are beaten&mdash;they are drove into the barracks!"</P>
<P>Some part of this conduct may hereafter be accounted for,

and other parts of it may &s;tand in a very different light. But we are ready to admit, that their behaviour was alto|gether unju&s;tifiable&mdash;for we don't look upon our&s;elves as a|ny way concerned in their conduct.&mdash;Conduct which, if &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es are not mi&s;taken, &s;eems more like that of madmen and barbarians, than like rea&s;onable creatures. If <HI>they</HI> acted like &s;avages or ruffians, what is that to <HI>us?</HI> This evidence, therefore not applying to this ca&s;e, we are injur|ed if it has any influence to our prejudice. Being foreign to the i&s;&s;ue, we humbly conceive it ought never to have been introduced;&mdash;or being introduced, it ought to be re|jected, in our determining the guilt or innocence of the pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>&rindx; Mr. <HI>Jo&s;iah Quincy</HI> then proceeded to a minute detail of the crown evidence, pointing out, as he went along, tho&s;e circum&s;tances that favoured the pri&s;oners; and com|menting chiefly on tho&s;e facts, which &s;erved to refute or in|validate the po&s;itions of the Council for the Crown; by &s;howing an a&s;&s;ult and attack upon <HI>the Sentry.</HI> He then re|viewed tho&s;e parts of the evidence, which had a tendency either to prove in&s;ult, abu&s;e, or a&s;&s;ault and battery of <HI>the party</HI>: he pointed out the various quarters, from which all the&s;e, but e&s;pecially the a&s;&s;ault and battery proceeded: and from the facts, time and circum&s;tances te&s;tified, inferred the attack to have been on various &s;ides at the &s;ame in&s;tant. From the noi&s;es, violence and rattling of the guns he drew other con&s;equences u&s;eful to his cau&s;e. From the inatten|tion of &s;ome, and the forgetfulne&s;s of others; from the tumult, fright, confu&s;ion and pa&s;&s;ions in the &s;cene, he made &s;uch deductions as might account for the contrariety and &s;eeming incompatibility of the evidence.</P>
<P>He next very particularly &s;tated the Evidence for the pri&s;oners, as he had been in&s;tructed it would turn out on ex|amination; and as he opened his evidence, he carefully re|marked its conformity to, and connection with, many parts of that already exhibited by the Council for the King.&mdash; He then called the witne&s;&s;es, who &s;wore as follow.]</P>

I then ob&s;erved more of the towns people come from towards the <HI>Market</HI>; there was a good deal of &s;quabble and noi&s;e betwixt the people and the officers, but what was &s;aid I could not bear. The next thing I recollect in the affair was, a little boy came down the alley, clapping his hand to his head, and cried he was killed, he was killed; on which one of the officers took hold of him, and damned him for a little ra&s;cal, a&s;king him what bu&s;ine&s;s he had out of doors; the boy &s;eemed to be a|bout &s;even or eight year old. Some little time after that, I &s;aw a &s;oldier come out of the barrack gate with his mu&s;|ket, he went directly facing the alley, in the middle of the &s;treet, and kneeled down on one knee, and &s;aid now damn your bloods, I will make a lane through you all; while he was pre&s;enting, Mr. <HI>Maul</HI> an En&s;ign, with either Mr. <HI>Dixon</HI> or Mr. <HI>Minchin,</HI> I do not know which, came after him, im|mediately laid hold of him, and took the mu&s;ket from him, &s;hoved him towards the barrack, and I think gave him the

I do not recollect any di&s;cour&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed between the towns people and officers, there was &s;till &s;uch clamour and confu&s;ion, that I could not hear what pa&s;&s;ed; but in a little time either the &s;oldier who came out before, or ano|ther, came out again, he repeated much the &s;ame words as the other, he had his gun in his hand, he did not offer to kneel down, but u&s;ed the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions.</P>

The examination has been &s;o lengthy, that I am afraid &s;ome painful &s;en&s;ations ari&s;e, when you find that you are now to fit and hear the remarks of council. But you &s;hould reflect, that no more indulgence is &s;hown to the Pri|&s;oners now on trial, than has ever been &s;hown in all capi|tal can &s;ee: the trial of one man has often taken up &s;everal days, when you con&s;ider, therefore, that there are eight li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> i&s;&s;ue, the importance of the trial will &s;how the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of its length. To each of the pri&s;oners different e|vidence applies, and each of them draw their defence from different quarters.</P>
<P>I &s;tated to you, Gentlemen, your duty, in opening this mu&s;e&mdash;do not forget the di&s;charge of it. You are paying a debt you owe the community for your own protection&punc; and &s;afety: by the &s;ame mode of trial are your own rights to receive a determination; and in your turn, a time may come, when you will expect and claim a &s;imilar return from &s;ome other jury of your fellow &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In opening, I pointed out the dangers to which you were expo&s;ed; I tru&s;t your own recollection will now preclude a recapitulation of them. The rea&s;ons of what I then &s;aid, I tru&s;t have in &s;ome mea&s;ure appeared: the propriety of &s;ome of tho&s;e ob&s;ervations has been corroborated by &s;ucceeding e|vidence; and you mu&s;t have traced your&s;elves, &s;ome of the&s;e con&s;equences, turning out in evidence, which have had an intimate relation, if not their origin, with &s;ome or all of tho&s;e opinions, notions, &s;entiments or pa&s;&s;ions (call them what you will) which I too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, as clues, aids, and leading &s;trings, in our intended examination and deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>How much need was there for my de&s;ire, that you &s;hould &s;u&s;pend your judgment till the witne&s;&s;es were all examin|ed? How different is the complexion of the cau&s;e? Will not all this &s;erve to &s;how every hone&s;t man, the little truth to he attained in partial hearings? We have often &s;een com|munities complain of <HI>ex parte</HI> te&s;timonies: individuals, as well as &s;ocieties, of men, are equally &s;u&s;ceptible of injuries of this kind: this trial ought to have another effect&punc; it &s;hould &s;erve to convince us all, of the impropriety, nay in|ju&s;tice, of giving a latitude in conver&s;ation upon topicks, likely to come under a judicial deci&s;ion; the criminality of this conduct is certainly inhanced, when &s;uch loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;allies

and di&s;cour&s;es are &s;o prevalent as to be likely to touch the life of a citizen. Moreover there is &s;o little certainty to be obtained by &s;uch kind of methods, I wonder we &s;o often find them practiced. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, how great was the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t us? And I appeal to you, Gentle|men, what cau&s;e there now is to alter our &s;entiments&punc; Will any &s;ober, prudent man countenance the proceedings of the people in <HI>King-&s;treet</HI>&mdash;can any one ju&s;tify their conduct&mdash;is there any one man, or any body of men, who are intere&s;t|ed to e&s;pou&s;e and &s;upport their conduct? Surely no. But <HI>our</HI> enquiry mu&s;t be confined to the <HI>legality</HI> of their conduct&punc; and here can be no difficulty. It was certainly illegal, un|le&s;s many witne&s;&s;es are directly perjured: Witne&s;&s;es who have no apparent intere&s;t to fal&s;ify&mdash;witne&s;&s;es, who have given their te&s;timony with candor and accuracy&mdash;witne&s;&s;es, who&s;e credibility &s;tands untouched&mdash;who&s;e credibility, the council for the king, do not pretend to impeach; or hin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;ugge&s;tion to their di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, Gentlemen, by the &s;tandard of the law are <HI>we</HI> to judge the actions of the people who were the a&s;&s;ailants, and tho&s;e who were the a&s;&s;ailed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hen on duty. And here&punc; Gentlemen, the rule, we formerly laid down, takes place. To the <HI>facts,</HI> Gentlemen, apply your&s;elves. Con&s;ider them as te&s;tified: weigh the credibility of the witne&s;&s;es&mdash; balance their te&s;timony&mdash;compare the &s;everal parts of it&mdash; &s;ee the amount of it:&mdash;and then according to your oaths &mdash;"Make <HI>true</HI> deliverance according to your <HI>evidence.</HI>" That is Gentlemen, having &s;ettled the facts&mdash;bring them truely to the &s;tandard of the law; the king's judges who are acquainted with it, who are pre&s;umed be&s;t to know it, will then in&s;pect this great &s;tandard of right and wrong, truth and ju&s;tice; and they are to determine the degree of guilt to which <HI>the fact</HI> ri&s;es.</P>
<P>But before we come to tho&s;e divi&s;ions of enquiry, under which I intend to con&s;ider the evidence, let me once more carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between the tran&s;actions in <HI>Cornhill</HI> and tho&s;e by the <HI>Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e.</HI></P>

Not here is <HI>the &s;oldier</HI> who has injured us&mdash;here is the fellow who wounded the man in <HI>Cornihll.</HI> No, the rea&s;oning or rather ferment &s;eems to be, the &s;oldiers have committed an outrage, we have an equal right to in|flict puni&s;hment&mdash;or rather revenge, which they had to make an a&s;&s;ault.&mdash;They &s;aid right, but never con&s;idered, that, <HI>tho&s;e</HI> &s;oldiers had <HI>no right</HI> at all. The&s;e are &s;enti|ments natural enough to per&s;ons in this &s;tate of mind&mdash;we can ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e even good men thinking and acting thus. Very &s;imilar to this is the force of Dr. <HI>Hirons</HI>'s te&s;timony, and &s;ome others. But our enquiry is&mdash;What &s;ays the law? We mu&s;t calmly enquire, whether this, or any thing like it, is countenanced by the law. What is <HI>natural</HI> to <HI>the man,</HI> what are his feelings are one thing: what is the <HI>duty</HI> of the <HI>citi|zen</HI> is quite another. Rea&s;on mu&s;t re&s;ume her &s;eat&mdash;and then we &s;hall hear, and obey the voice of the law.</P>
<P>The law indulges no man in being his own avenger.&mdash; Early, in the hi&s;tory of juri&s;prudence, we find the &s;word taken from the party injured, and put into the hands of the magi&s;trate. Were not this the ca&s;e, puni&s;hment would know no bounds in extent or duration. Be&s;ides, it &s;aps the very root of di&s;tributive ju&s;tice, when any individual in|vades the prerogative of law, and &s;natches from the civil magi&s;trate the balance and the rod. How much more are the

pillars of &s;ecurity &s;haken, when a mixt body, a&s;&s;embled as tho&s;e in <HI>King-&s;treet,</HI> a&s;&s;ume the province of ju&s;tice, and in|vade the rights of the citizen? For it mu&s;t not be forgot, that the &s;oldier is a citizen, equally intitled with us all to protection and &s;ecurity. Hence all are alike obliged to pay obedience to the law: For the price of this protection is that of obedience.</P>
<P>Let it not be apprehended, that I am advancing a doc|trine, that a &s;oldier may attack an inhabitant, and he not allowed to defend him&s;elf. No Gentlemen! if a &s;oldier ru&s;h violently through the &s;treet and pre&s;ents a weapon of death, in a &s;triking po&s;ture; no doubt the per&s;on a&s;&s;ailed may defend him&s;elf, even to taking the life of the a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l|ant. Revenge and a &s;en&s;e of &s;elf pre&s;ervation in&s;tantly take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the per&s;on thus attacked; and the law goes not upon the ab&s;urd &s;uppo&s;ition, that a per&s;on can in the&s;e circum&s;tances, unman him&s;elf. Hence we find a hu&s;|band, taking his wife in the act of adultery, in&s;tantly &s;eizes a deadly weapon and &s;lays the adulterer;&mdash;it is not murder. Nay a fillip upon the no&s;e or forehead, in an|ger, is &s;uppo&s;ed by the law to be &s;ufficient provocation to reduce killing to Man&s;laughter. It is, therefore, upon prin|ciples like the&s;e, principles, upon which tho&s;e, who now bear the harde&s;t again&s;t us, at other times, &s;o much de|pend; it is, I &s;ay, upon the right of &s;elf-defence and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation we rely for our acquittal.</P>
<P>Here again it &s;hould be kept in view, that whenever the party injurying has e&s;caped by flight, and time &s;ufficient for the pa&s;&s;ions to cool, in judgment of law, hath elap&s;ed; however great the injury, the injured party mu&s;t have re|cour&s;e to law for his redre&s;s. Such is the wi&s;dom of the law; of that law, than which we are none of us to pre&s;ume our&s;elves wi&s;er;&mdash;of that law, which is &s;onned in the ex|perience of ages, and which in conde&s;cen&s;ion to the infir|mities of fle&s;h and blood (but to nothing el&s;e) extenuates the offence. For
<Q>no man, &s;ays the learned Judge <HI>Fo&s;ter, under the protection of the law</HI> is to be the <HI>avenger</HI> of his own wrongs. If they are of &s;uch a nature for which the laws of &s;ociety will give him an andequate remedy, <HI>thither</HI> he ought to re&s;ort.

<P>He next pur&s;ued &s;everal parties, through the &s;everal lanes and &s;treets, till they centered at the &s;cene of action.</P>

<P>The <HI>words, in&s;ult</HI> and <HI>ge&s;tures</HI> of the &s;ame per&s;ons were next pointed out: and from thence was collected the de&s;igns of the per&s;ons <HI>a&s;&s;aulting,</HI> and the rea&s;onable apprehen&s;ions of tho&s;e <HI>a&s;&s;aulted.</HI></P>

<P>AFTER having thus gone through the evidence, and con|&s;idered it as applicatory to <HI>all</HI> and <HI>every</HI> of the pri&s;oners, the next matter in order &s;eems to be the con&s;ideration of the law pertinent upon this evidence.</P>
<P>And here, Gentlemen, let me again inform you, that the law which is to pa&s;s upon the&s;e pri&s;oners, is a law adapting it&s;elf to the human &s;peices, with all their feelings, pa&s;&s;ions and infirmities; a law which does not go upon the ab&s;urd &s;uppo&s;ition, that men are &s;tocks and &s;tones; or that in the fervour of the blood, a man can act with the diliberation and judgment of a philo&s;opher. No Gentlemen:&mdash;the law &s;uppo&s;es that a principle of re&s;entment, for wi&s;e and obvi|ous

rea&s;ons, is deeply implanted in the human heart; and not to be eradicated by the efforts of &s;tate policy. It, there|fore, in &s;ome degree conforms it&s;elf to all the workings of the pa&s;&s;ions, to which it pays a great indulgence, &s;o far as not to be wholly incompatible, with the wi&s;dom, good order and the very being of government.</P>
<P>Keeping therefore this full in view, let us take once more, a very brief and cur&s;ory &s;urvey of matters &s;upported by the evidence. And, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, let me a&s;k &s;ober rea&s;on&mdash;What langu|age more approbrious&mdash;What actions more exa&s;perating, than tho&s;e u&s;ed, on this occa&s;ion? Words, I am &s;en&s;ible are no <HI>ju&s;tification</HI> of blows, but they &s;erve as the grand clues to di&s;cover the temper and the de&s;igns of the agents: they &s;erve al&s;o to give us light in di&s;cerning the apprehen&s;ions and thoughts of tho&s;e who are the objects of abu&s;e.</P>
<P>"You lob&s;ter," "You bloody-back," "You coward" and "You da&s;tard," are but &s;ome of the expre&s;&s;ions proved.&mdash; What words more galling? What more cutting and pro|voking to a &s;oldier? To be reminded of the colour of his garb, by which he was di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of his fellow citizens; to be compared to the mo&s;t de&s;picable an|nimal, that crawls upon the earth, was touching indeed a tender point, To be &s;tigmatized with having &s;marted un|der the la&s;h, at the halbert, to be twited with &s;o infamous an ignominy; which was either wholly unde&s;erved, or a grievance which &s;hould never have been repeated:&mdash;I &s;ay to call up and awaken &s;en&s;ations of this kind, mu&s;t &s;ting e|ven to madne&s;s. But accouple the&s;e words with the &s;uc|ceeding actions,&mdash;"You da&s;tard,"&mdash;"You coward!"&mdash;A &s;oldier and a coward! This was touching, (with a witne&s;s) "<HI>The point of honour,</HI> and the pride of virtue."&mdash;But while the&s;e are as yet fomenting the pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;welling the bo&s;om, the attack is made: and probably the latter words were reitterated at the on&s;et; at le&s;t, were yet &s;ound|ing in the ear. Gentlemen of the jury, for heaven's &s;ake, let us put our&s;elves in the &s;ame &s;ituation! Would you not &s;purn at that &s;piritle&s;s in&s;titution of &s;ociety, which tells you to be a <HI>&s;ubject</HI> at the expence of your <HI>manhood?</HI></P>
<P>But does the &s;oldier &s;tep out of his ranks to &s;eek his re|venge? Not a witne&s;s pretends it: Did the people repeat|edly come within the points of their bayonets, and &s;trike on the muzzels of the guns?&mdash;You have heard the wit|ne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="011683_0072_0F87C7F1E653CC50">Does the law allow one member of the community to be|have in this manner towards his fellow-citizen, and then bid the injured party be calm and moderate?

Does com|mon &s;en&s;e, does the law expect impo&s;&s;ibilities? <HI>Here,</HI> to ex|pect equanimity of temper, would be as irrational, as to ex|pect di&s;cretion in a mad man. But was any thing done on the part of the a&s;&s;ailants, &s;imilar to the conduct, warn|ings and declarations of the pri&s;oners? An&s;wer for your|&s;elves, Gentlemen.

Fear, anger, pride, re&s;entment, revenge, alternately, take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole man.

<P>Prepare, Gentlemen of the Jury, now to attend to that &s;pecies of law, which will adapt it&s;elf to this trial, with all its &s;ingular and aggravating circum&s;tances. A law full of benignity, full of compa&s;&s;ion, replete with mercy.</P>
<P>And here, Gentlemen, I mu&s;t, agreeable to the method we formerly adopted, fir&s;t tell you by what law the pri&s;o|ners are <HI>not</HI> to be tried, or condemned. And they mo&s;t certainly are <HI>not</HI> to be tried by the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> law: a law, we take it, peculiarly de&s;igned for the government of a pecu|liar nation, who being in a great mea&s;ure under a theo|cratical form of government, it's in&s;titutions cannot, with any propriety, be adduced for our regulation in the&s;e days. It is with pain, therefore, I have ob&s;erved any endeavour to mi&s;lead our judgment on this occa&s;ion; by drawing our at|tention
<PB N="143" REF="011683_0072_0F87C7F1E653CC50">
to the precepts delivered in the days of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> and by di&s;connected pa&s;&s;ages of Scriptures, applied in a man|ner foreign to their original de&s;ign or import, there &s;eems to have been an attempt to touch &s;ome peculiar &s;entiments, which we know are thought to be prevalent; and in this way, we take it, an injury is like to be done, by giving the mind a bia&s;s, it ought never to have received; becau&s;e it is not warranted by our laws.</P>
<P>We have heard it publicly &s;aid of late, oftener, than for|merly,
<Q>Who&s;oever &s;hedeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed.</Q>
This is plainly, Gentlemen, a general rule, which, like all others of the kind mu&s;t have its ex|ceptions. A rule, which if taken in it's &s;trict litteral lattitude, would imply, that a man killing another in &s;elf defence, would incur the pains of death. A doctrine, which no man in his &s;en&s;es would ever embrace: a doctrine that certainly never prevailed under the <HI>Mo&s;aical</HI> in&s;tituti|on. For we find, the <HI>Jews</HI> had their &s;ix cities of refuge, to which the man&s;layer might flee, from the avenger of blood. And &s;omething analogous to this, (if it did not originate from it) is our benefit of clergy.</P>
<P>And &s;o, that "the <HI>murderer</HI> &s;hall flee to the pit" comes under the &s;ame con&s;ideration. And when we hear it a&s;ked, as it very lately has been, "Who DARE &s;tay him?" I an|&s;wer, if the laws of our country &s;tay him, you ought to do likewi&s;e; and every good &s;ubject <HI>dares</HI> to do what the law allows. But the very po&s;ition is <HI>begging the que&s;tion:</HI> for the que&s;tion, now in i&s;&s;ue, is, whether either of the pri&s;oners is <HI>a murderer,</HI> in the &s;en&s;e of our laws; for you recollect, that what is murder and what not, is <HI>a que&s;tion of law,</HI> ari&s;|ing upon facts &s;tated and allowed.</P>
<P>But to go on;
<Q>You &s;hall take no &s;atisfaction for the life of a <HI>murderer,</HI> which is <HI>guilty of death.</HI></Q>
Here again, is a begging the que&s;tion; and moreover the words "<HI>guilty of death,</HI>" if rightly rendered from the original, mu&s;t be one of tho&s;e general rules, I ju&s;t now mentioned; which always have their exceptions. But tho&s;e words &s;eem to be wrong tran&s;lated; for in the margin of our great bible, we find them rendered "<HI>faulty to die.</HI>" Again&s;t a po&s;ition of this kind we have no objection. If we have committed <HI>a fault,</HI> on which <HI>our laws</HI> inflict the puni&s;hment of <HI>death,</HI> we mu&s;t &s;uffer. But what fault we have committed you are to enquire: or rather you, Gentlemen, are to find the

<HI>facts proved in Court again&s;t us,</HI> and the Judges are to &s;ee and con&s;ider what the law pronounces touching our offence, and what puni&s;hment is thereby inflicted as a penalty.</P>
<P>In order to come at the whole law re&s;ulting from the facts which have been proved, we mu&s;t enquire into the LEGALITY of the <HI>a&s;&s;emblies.</HI> For &s;uch is the wi&s;dom and policy of the law, that if any a&s;&s;embly be <HI>lawful,</HI> each in dividual of that a&s;&s;embly is an&s;werable <HI>only for his own<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> act,</HI> and <HI>not for any other.</HI> On the contrary, if an a&s;&s;embly be <HI>unlawful, the act of any one</HI> of the company, to the particu|lar purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;embling, is <HI>chargeable on all.</HI> This is law, which no lawyer will di&s;pute; it is a law founded in the &s;ecurity of the peace of &s;ociety, and however little con&s;i|dered, by people in general, it ought now &s;teadily to be kept in mind.</P>

<P>The law laid down, in <HI>Fo&s;ter,</HI> 261, 2. before cited, being indi&s;putable law, not denied or controverted; and being very material in the trial, and much relied on by the pri|&s;oners, is here &s;et down at large.</P>
<P>"I will mention a ca&s;e, (&s;ays the learned Judge,) which through the ignorance or leuity of juries hath been &s;ome|times brought within the rule of accidental death. It is where a blow aimed at <HI>one</HI> per&s;on lighteth upon <HI>another</HI> and killeth him. This, in a loo&s;e way of &s;peaking, may be cal|led accidental <HI>with regard to the per&s;on who dieth by a blow not intended again&s;t</HI> HIM. But the law con&s;idereth this ca&s;e in a quite different light. If from circum&s;tances it appear|eth that the injury intended to A. be it by poi&s;on, blow, or ANY OTHER MEANS OF DEATH, would have amounted to murder, &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>him</HI> to have been killed by it, it will amount to the &s;ame offence if B. happeneth to fall by the &s;ame means. Our books &s;ay, that in this ca&s;e the malice <HI>egreditur per&s;onam</HI> But to &s;peak more intelligibly, where the injury intended again&s;t A. proceeded from a wicked, murderons, or mi&s;chievous motive, the party is an&s;werable for all the con&s;equences of the action, if death en&s;ues, from
<PB N="146" REF="011683_0074_0F87C7F35CE0CAB0">
it, though it had not its effect upon the per&s;on whom he intended to de&s;troy. The <HI>malitia</HI> I have already explained, the heart regardle&s;s of &s;ocial duty DELIBERATELY bent upon mi&s;chief, con&s;equently the guilt of the party is ju&s;t the &s;ame in the one ca&s;e as the other. <HI>On the other hand,</HI> if the blow intended again&s;t A. and lighting on B. <HI>aro&s;e from a &s;udden tra&s;port of pa&s;&s;ion</HI> which in ca&s;e A. had died by it, <HI>would have been reduced to man&s;laughter,</HI> the fact will admit of the SAME ALLEVIATION if B. &s;hould happen to fall by it."

<P>I have now gone thro' tho&s;e authorities in law, which I thought pertinent to this trial. I have been thus lengthy, not for the information of the Court, but to &s;atisfy you, Gentlemen, and all who may chance to hear me, of that law, which is well known to tho&s;e of us, who are conver|&s;ant in cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, but not &s;o generally known, or attended to, by many, as <HI>it ought to be.</HI> A law which extends to each of us, as well as to any of the pri&s;oners; for it knows <HI>no di&s;|tinction of per&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>And the doctrines which have been thus laid down are for the &s;afeguard of us all. Doctrines which are founded in the wi&s;dom and policy of ages; which the greate&s;t men, whoever lived, have adopted and contended for. Nay, the matter has been carried, by very wi&s;e men, much further than we have conte&s;ted for. And that you may not think the purport of the authorities read, are the rigid notions of a dry &s;y&s;tem, and the contracted deci&s;ions of municipal law, I beg leave to read to you a pa&s;&s;age from a very great, theortic, writer: a man who&s;e prai&s;es have re&s;ounded through all the known world, and probably will, through all ages, who&s;e &s;entiments are as free air, and who has done as much for learning, liberty, and mankind, as any of the Sons of <HI>Adam</HI>; I mean the &s;agacious Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>: He will tell you, Gentlemen, in his E&s;&s;ay on Government, p. 2. c. 3. "That <HI>all manner of force without right</HI> puts man in a &s;tate of <HI>war</HI> with the <HI>aggre&s;&s;or</HI>; and of con&s;equence, that, being in &s;uch a &s;tate of <HI>war,</HI> he may LAWFULLY KILL him, who put him under this <HI>unnatural</HI> re&s;traint." According to this doctrine, we &s;hould have nothing to do, but enquire, whe|ther here was "<HI>force without right</HI>:" if &s;o, we were <HI>in &s;uch a &s;tate,</HI> as rendered it LAWFUL TO KILL the aggre&s;&s;or, who
<PB N="147" REF="011683_0074_0F87C7F35CE0CAB0">
<Q>put us under &s;o <HI>unnatural</HI> a <HI>re&s;traint.</HI> Few, I believe, will &s;ay, after hearing <HI>all</HI> this evidence, that we were under no <HI>unnatural re&s;traint.</HI></Q>
But we don't want to extend matters &s;o far. We cite this author to &s;how the world, that the greate&s;t friends to their country, to univer&s;al liberty, and the im|mutable rights of all men, have held tenets, and advanced maxims favourable to the pri&s;oners at the bar. And al|though we &s;hould not adopt the &s;entiments of Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> in their mo&s;t exten&s;ive latitude, yet there &s;eems to be &s;ome|thing very analogous to his opinion, which is countenan|ced in our laws.</P>
<P>There is a &s;pirit which pervades the whole &s;y&s;tem of <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> juri&s;prudence, which in&s;pires a freedom of thought, &s;peech and behaviour. Under a form of government like ours, it would be in vain to expect, that pacific, timid, ob|&s;equious, and &s;ervile temper, &s;o predominant in more de&s;potic governments. From our happy con&s;titution there re&s;ults it's very natural effects&mdash;an impatience of injuries, and a &s;trong re&s;entment of in&s;ults: (and a very wi&s;e man has &s;aid, "He who <HI>tamely</HI> beareth in&s;ults <HI>inviteth</HI> injuries.") Hence, I take it, that attention to the "feelings of humanity"&mdash; to "humanity and imperfection"&mdash;"the infirmities of fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h and blood;"
that attention to
"the indelible rights of mankind;"&mdash;that lenity to "the pa&s;&s;ions of man;"&mdash; that "benignity and conde&s;cention of the law" &s;o often repeated in our books.</P>
<P>And, indeed, if this were not the ca&s;e, the genius of our civil con&s;titution and the &s;pirit of our municipal law would be repugnant:&mdash;that prime defect in any political &s;y&s;tem &mdash;that grand &s;oleci&s;m in &s;tate-policy.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>This cau&s;e has taken up much of your time, and is like|ly to take up &s;o much more, that I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to a clo&s;e: indeed I &s;hould not have troubled you, by being thus leng|thy, but from a &s;en&s;e of duty to the pri&s;oners; they, who, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, may be &s;aid to have put their lives in my hands; they who&s;e &s;ituation was &s;o peculiar, that we have nece&s;&s;arily taken up more time, than ordinary ca&s;es re|quire: they, under all the&s;e circum&s;tances, placed a confi|dence, it was my duty not to di&s;appoint; and which I have aimed at di&s;charging with fidelity. I tru&s;t you, Gentle|men, will do the like: that you will examine and judge with a becoming temper of mind; remembering that they

who are <HI>under oath</HI> to declare the <HI>whole truth,</HI> think and act very differently from by &s;tanders, who, being under no+ties of this kind, take a latitude, which is by no means ad|mi&s;&s;ible in a <HI>court of law.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot clo&s;e this cau&s;e better, than by de&s;iring you to con&s;ider well the genius and &s;pirit of the law, which will be laid down, and to govern your&s;elves by this great &s;tan|dard of truth. To &s;ome purpo&s;es, you may be &s;aid, Gen|tlemen, to be <HI>Mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice</HI>: and "Mini&s;ters (&s;ays a learned Judge)

<P>I leave you, Gentlemen, hoping you will be directed in your enquiry and judgment; to a right di&s;charge of your duty. We &s;hall all of us, Gentlemen, have an hour of cool reflection&mdash;when the feelings and agitations of the day &s;hall have &s;ub&s;ided; when we &s;hall view things through a different, and a much ju&s;ter medium. It is, <HI>then,</HI> we all wi&s;h an ab&s;olving con&s;cience.

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Honours and you Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am for the pri&s;oners at the bar, and &s;hall apologize for it only in the words of the Marquis <HI>Beccaria</HI>: "If I can but be the in&s;trument of pre&s;erving one life, his ble&s;&s;ing and tears of tran&s;port, &s;hall be a &s;ufficient con&s;olation to me, for the contempt of all mankind." As the pri&s;oners &s;tand be|fore you for their lives, it may be proper, to recollect with what temper the law requires we &s;hould proceed to this trial. The form of proceeding at their arraignment, has di&s;covered that the &s;pirit of the law upon &s;uch occa&s;&s;ions, is
<PB N="149" REF="011683_0075_0F87C7F9F3E23230">
conformable to humanity, to common &s;en&s;e and feeling; that it is all benignity and candor. And the trial com|mences with the prayer of the Court, expre&s;&s;ed by the Clerk, to the Supream JUDGE of Judges, empires and worlds: "God &s;end you a good deliverance."</P>
<P>We find, in the rules laid down by the greate&s;t Engli&s;h Judges, who have been the brighte&s;t of mankind;&mdash;We are to look upon it as more beneficial, that many guilty per&s;ons &s;hould e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed, than one innocent per|&s;on &s;hould &s;uffer. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e it's of more im|portance to community, that innocence &s;hould be protect|ed, than it is, that guilt &s;hould be puni&s;hed; for guilt and crimes are &s;o frequent in the world, that all of them can|not be puni&s;hed; and many times they happen in &s;uch a manner, that it is not of much con&s;equence to the public, whether they are puni&s;hed or not. But when innocence it &s;elf, is brought to the bar and condemned, e&s;pecially to die, the &s;ubject will exclaim, it is immaterial to me, whether I behave well or ill; for virtue it&s;elf, is no &s;ecurity. And if &s;uch a &s;entiment as this, &s;hould take place in the mind of the &s;ubject, there would be an end to all &s;ecurity what&s;oe|ver. I will read the words of the law it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The rules I &s;hall produce to you from Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hale,</HI> who&s;e character as a lawyer, a man of learning and philo&s;ophy, and as a chri&s;tian, will he di&s;puted by nobody living; one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t characters, the Engli&s;h nation ever produced: his words are the&s;e. 2. H. H. P. C. <HI>Tutius &s;emper e&s;t errare, in acquietando, quam in puniendo, ex|parte mi&s;ericerdioe, quam ex parte ju&s;tifioe,</HI> it is always &s;afer to err in acquitting, than puni&s;hing, on the part of mercy, than the part of ju&s;tice: The next is from the &s;ame au|thority, 305 <HI>Tutius erratur ex parte mitiori,</HI> it is always &s;afer to err on the milder &s;ide, the &s;ide of mercy, H. H. P. C. 509, the be&s;t rule in doubtful ca&s;es, is, rather to incline to acquital than conviction: and in page 300 <HI>Quod dubitas ne feceris,</HI> Where you are doubtful never act; that is, if you doubt of the pri&s;oners guilt, never declare him guilty; this is always the rule, e&s;pecially in ca&s;es of life. An other rule from the &s;ame Author, 289, where he &s;ays, In &s;ome ca&s;es, pre&s;umptive evidence go far to prove a per&s;on guil|ty, though there is no expre&s;s proof of the fact, to be com|mitted by him; but then it mu&s;t be very warily pre&s;&s;ed, for
<PB N="150" REF="011683_0076_0F87C7FA76B4A768">
it is better, five guilty per&s;ons &s;hould e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed, than one innocent per&s;on &s;hould die.</P>
<P>The next authority &s;hall be from another Judge, of equal character, con&s;idering the age wherein he lived; that is Chancellor <HI>Forte&s;cue,</HI> in prai&s;e of the laws of England, page 59, this is a very ancient writer on the Engli&s;h law: his words are, "Indeed one would rather, much rather, that twenty guilty per&s;ons e&s;cape the puni&s;hment of death, than one innocent per&s;on be condemned, and &s;uffer capitally." Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hale,</HI> &s;ays, It is better five guilty per&s;ons e&s;cape, than one innocent per&s;on &s;uffer. Lord Chancellor <HI>Forti&s;cue,</HI> you &s;ee, carries the matter farther, and &s;ays, In|deed one had rather, much rather, that twenty guilty per|&s;ons &s;hould e&s;cape, than one innocent per&s;on &s;uffer capitally. Indeed this rule is not peculiar to the Engli&s;h law, there never was a &s;y&s;tem of laws in the world, in which this rule did not prevail; it prevailed in the ancient Roman law, and which is more remarkable, it prevails in the modern Roman law, even the Judges in the Courts of Inqui&s;i|tion, who with racks, burnings and &s;courges, examine cri|minals, even there, they pre&s;erve it as a maxim, that it is better the guilty &s;hould e&s;cape puni&s;hment, than the inno|cent &s;uffer. <HI>Satius e&s;&s;e nocentem ab&s;olvi quam in&s;entem damnari,</HI> this is the temper we ought to &s;et out with; and the&s;e the rules we are to be governed by. And I &s;hall take it for granted, as a fir&s;t principle, that the eight pri&s;oners at the bar, had better be all acquitted, though we &s;hould admit them all to be guilty, than, that any one of them &s;hould by your verdict be found guilty, being innocent.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now con&s;ider the &s;everal divi&s;ions of law, under which the evidence will arrange it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The action now before you, is homicide; that is the kil|ling of one man by another, the law calls it homicide, but it is not criminal in all ca&s;es, for one man to &s;lay another. Had the pri&s;oners been on the <HI>Plains of Abraham,</HI> and &s;lain an hundred <HI>Frenchmen</HI> a piece, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> law would have con&s;idered it, as a commendable action, virtuous and prai&s;|worthy: &s;o that every in&s;tance of killing a man, is not a crime in the eye of the law; there are many other in&s;tances which I can not enumerate, an officer that executes a per|&s;on under &s;entence of death, &amp;c. So that Gentlemen, eve|ry in&s;tance of one man's killing another, is not a crime,
<PB N="151" REF="011683_0076_0F87C7FA76B4A768">
much le&s;s a crime to be puni&s;hed with death. But to de|&s;cend to &s;ome more particulars.</P>
<P>The law divides homicide into three branches; the fir&s;t, is ju&s;tifiable, the &s;econd excu&s;able, and the third felonious; felonious homicide, is &s;ubdivided into two branches; the fir&s;t is murder, which is killing with malice aforethought, the &s;econd is man&s;laughter, which is killing a man on a &s;udden provocation: here Gentlemen, are four &s;orts of ho|micide, and you are to con&s;ider, whether all the evidence amounts to the fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, or fourth, of the&s;e heads. The fact, was the &s;laying five unhappy per&s;ons that night; you are to con&s;ider, whether it was ju&s;tifiable, excu&s;able, or felonious; and if felonious, whether it was murder or man&s;laughter. One of the&s;e four it mu&s;t be, you need not divide your attention to any more particu|lars. I &s;hall however, before I come to the evidence, &s;how you &s;everal authorities, which will a&s;&s;i&s;t you and me in con|templating the evidence before us.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with ju&s;tifialbe homicide; if an officer a &s;heriff execute a man on the gallows, draws and quarters him, as in ca&s;e of high trea&s;on, and cuts off his head, this is ju&s;ti|fiable homicide, it is his duty. So al&s;o, Gentlemen, the law has planted fences and barriers around every individual; it is a ca&s;tle round every man's per&s;on, as well as his hou&s;e.&mdash; As the love of God and our neighbour, comprehends the whole duty of man, &s;o &s;elf-love and &s;ocial, comprehend all the duties we owe to mankind, and the fir&s;t branch is &s;elf-love, which is not only our indi&s;putable right, but our cleare&s;t duty, by the laws of nature, this is interwoven in the heart of every individual; God almighty, who&s;e laws we cannot alter, has implanted it there, and we can an|nihilate our&s;elves, as ea&s;ily as root out this affection for our&s;elves. It is the fir&s;t, and &s;tronge&s;t principle in our na|ture, Ju&s;tice <HI>Black&s;tone</HI> calls it, "The primary cannon in the law of nature." That precept of our holy religion which commands us to love our neighbour as our&s;elves doth not command us to love our neighbour better than our&s;elves, or &s;o well, no Chri&s;tian Divine hath given this interpretation. The precept enjoins, that our benevolence to our fellow men, &s;hould be as real and &s;incere, as our af|fections to our&s;elves, not that it &s;hould be as great in de|gree. A man is authori&s;ed therefore by common &s;en&s;e, and the laws of Egland, as well as tho&s;e of nature, to love
<PB N="152" REF="011683_0077_0F87C7FAE82177D0">
him&s;elf better than his fellow &s;ubject: If two per&s;ons are ca&s;t away at &s;ea, and get on a plank, (a ca&s;e put by Sir Francis <HI>Bacon,</HI>) and the plank is in&s;ufficient to hold them both, the one hath a right to pu&s;h the other of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to &s;ave him&s;elf. The rules of the common law therefore, which authorize a man to pre&s;erve his own life at the expence of another's, are not contradicted by any divine or moral law. We talk of liberty and property, but, if we cut up the law of &s;elf-defence, we cut up the foundation of both, and if we give up this, the re&s;t is of very little value, and therefore, this principle mu&s;t be &s;trictly attended to, for what&s;oever the law pronounces in the ca&s;e of the&s;e eight &s;oldiers will be the law, to other per&s;ons and after ages, all the per&s;ons that have &s;lain mankind in this country, from the beginning to this day, had better have been acquitted, than that a wrong rule and precedent &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now, read to you a few authorities on this &s;ubject of &s;elf-defence. Fo&s;ter 273 in the ca&s;e of ju&s;ti|fiable &s;elf-defence, "The injured party may repell force with force in defence of his per&s;on, habitation, or property, again&s;t one who manife&s;tly intendeth and en|deavoureth with violence, or &s;urprize, to commit a known felony upon either."&mdash;In the&s;e ca&s;es, he is not obliged to re|treat, but may pur&s;ue his adver&s;ary, till he findeth him|&s;elf out of danger, and if in a conflict between them he happeneth to kill, &s;uch killing is ju&s;tifiable." Keiling, 128, 129. I mu&s;t intreat you, to con&s;ider the words of this authority, the injured per&s;on may repell force by force again&s;t any who endeavours to commit any kind of felony on him or his, here the rule is, I have a right to &s;tand on my own defence, if you intend to com|mit felony; if any of the per&s;ons made an attack on the&s;e &s;oldiers, with an intention to rob them, if it was but to take their hats feloniou&s;ly, they had a right to kill them on the &s;pot, and had no bu&s;ine&s;s to retreat; if a robber meets me in the &s;treet, and commands me to &s;urrender my pur&s;e, I have a right to kill him without a&s;king que&s;tions; if a per&s;ons commits a bare a&s;&s;ault on me, this will not ju&s;|tify killing, but if he a&s;&s;aults me in &s;uch a manner, as to di&s;cover an intention, to kill me, I have a right to de&s;troy him, that I may put it out of his power to kill me. In the ca&s;e you will have to con&s;ider, I do not know there was any attempt to &s;teal from the&s;e per&s;ons; however,
<PB N="153" REF="011683_0077_0F87C7FAE82177D0">

<P>In the ca&s;e here, we will take <HI>Montgomery,</HI> if you plea&s;e, when he was attacked by the &s;tout man with the &s;tick, who aimed it at his head, with a number of people round him, crying out, Kill them!

I will not at pre&s;ent, look for any more authorities in the point of &s;elf-defence; you will be able to judge from the&s;e, how far the law goes, in ju&s;tifying or excu&s;ing any per&s;on in defence of him&s;elf, or taking away the life of another who threatens him, in life or limb: the next point is this, That in ca&s;e of an unlawful a&s;&s;embly, all and every one of the a&s;&s;embly is guilty of all and every unlawful act, committed by any one of that a&s;&s;embly, in pro&s;ecution of the unlawful de|&s;ign they &s;et out upon.</P>
<P>Rules of law &s;hould be univer&s;ally known, what ever ef|fect they may have on politics; they are rules of common law, the law of the land, and it is certainly true, that where ever there is an unlawful a&s;&s;embly, let it con&s;i&s;t of many per&s;ons or a few, every man in it is guilty of every unlaw|ful act of committed by any one of the whole party, be they more or be they le&s;s, in pur&s;uance of their unlawful de&s;ign. This is the policy of the law: to di&s;courage and pre|vent riots, in&s;urrections, turbulence and tumults.</P>

<PB N="157" REF="011683_0079_0F87C7FC629E4248">
&s;hocks of fortune and the whirls of pa&s;&s;ion, that take place at certain critical &s;ea&s;ons, even in the milde&s;t government, the people are liable to run into riots and tumults.&mdash;There are Church-quakes and &s;tate-quakes, in the moral and political world, as well as earthquakes, &s;torms and tempe&s;ts in the phy&s;ical&mdash;Thus much however mu&s;t be &s;aid in favour of the people and of human nature, that it is a ge|neral, if not univer&s;al truth, that the aptitude of the people to mutinies, &s;editions, tumults and in&s;urrections, is in direct proportion to the de&s;poti&s;m of the government.&mdash; In governments compleatly de&s;potic, <HI>i.e.</HI> where the will of one man, is the only law, this di&s;po&s;ition is mo&s;t prevalent. &mdash;In Ari&s;tocracies, next&mdash;in mixed Monarchies, le&s;s than ei|ther of the former&mdash;in compleat Republick's the lea&s;t of all &mdash;and under the &s;ame form of government as in a limited monarchy, for example, the virtue and wi&s;dom of the ad|mini&s;tration, may generally be mea&s;ured by the peace and order, that are &s;een among the people.&mdash;However this may be, &s;uch is the imperfection of all things in this world, that no form of government, and perhaps no wi&s;dom or virtue in the admini&s;tration, can at all times avoid riots and di&s;orders among the people."</P>
<P>Now it is from this difficulty, that the policy of the law hath framed &s;uch &s;trong di&s;couragements, to &s;ecure the people again&s;t tumults; becau&s;e when they once begin, there is danger of their running to &s;uch exce&s;&s;es, as will overturn the whole &s;y&s;tem of government.&mdash; There is the rule from the reverend &s;age of the law, &s;o often quoted before.</P>
<P>I. H. H. P. C. 437. "All pre&s;ent, aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting, are equally principal with him that gave the &s;troke, where|of the party died. For tho' one gave the &s;troke, yet in in|terpretation of law, it is the &s;troke of every per&s;on, that was pre&s;ent aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting."</P>
<P>I. H. H. P. C. 440. "If divers come with one a&s;&s;ent to do mi&s;chief, as to kill, rob, or beat, and one doth it, they are all principals in the felony. If many be pre&s;ent, and one only gives the &s;troke whereof the party dies, they are all principal, if they came for that purpo&s;e."</P>
<P>Now if the party at <HI>Deck-&s;quare,</HI> came with an in|tention only to beat the &s;oldiers, and began the affray with them, and any of them had been accidentally killed, it would have been murder, becau&s;e it was an unlawful de|&s;ign

they came upon; if but one does it, they are all con|&s;idered in the eye of the law to be guilty, if any one gives the mortal &s;troke, they are all principal here, therefore there is a rever&s;al of the &s;cene; if you are &s;atisfied, that the&s;e &s;oldiers were there on a lawful de&s;ign and it &s;hould be proved any of them &s;hot without provocation and killed a|ny body, he only is an&s;werable for it. Fir&s;t Hale's pleas of the crown.</P>
<P>I. H. H. P. C. 444. "Although if many come upon an un|lawful de&s;ign, and one of the company kill one of the ad|ver&s;e party, in pur&s;uance of that de&s;ign, all are principals; yet if many be together upon a lawful account, and one of the company, kill another of an adver&s;e party, without any particular abetment of the re&s;t to this fact of homicide they are not all guilty that are of the company, but only tho&s;e that gave the &s;troke or actually abetted him to do it."</P>
<P>I. H. H. P. C. 445. "In the ca&s;e of a riotous a&s;&s;embly to rob or &s;teal deer, or do any unlawful act of violence, there the offence of one, is the offence of all the company."</P>
<P>In an other place, I. H. H. P. C. 439. "The <HI>Lord Dacre</HI> and divers others went to &s;teal deer in the park of one Pel|ham &mdash;Raydon one of the company, killed the keeper in the park: the <HI>Lord Dacre</HI> and the re&s;t of the company being in the other part of the park. Yet it was adjudged murder in them all, and they died for it.&mdash;And he quotes Crompton, 25. Dalton 93 p. 241." So that in &s;o &s;trong a ca&s;e as this, where this nobleman &s;et out to hunt deer in the ground of another, he was in one part of the park, his company in another part, yet they were all guilty of murder."</P>
<P>The, next is <HI>Hale</HI>'s Pleas of the Crown, 1. H. H. P. C. 440. "The ca&s;e of <HI>Drayton Ba&s;&s;it,</HI> diver&s;e per&s;ons doing an un|lawful act, all are guilty of what is done by one."</P>

And in ca&s;es of homi|cide, committed in con&s;equence of them, every per&s;on pre|&s;ent; in the &s;en&s;e of the law, when the homicide hath been committed, hath been involved in the guilt of him that gave the mortal blow."</P>

<P>Well, I &s;ay, if the people did this, or if this was only their intention, &s;urely the officer and &s;oldiers had a right to go to his relief, and therefore they &s;et out upon a lawful errand, they were therefore a lawful a&s;&s;embly, if we only con&s;ider them as private &s;ubjects and fellow citi|zens, without regard to Mutiny Acts, Articles of War, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oldiers Oaths; a private per&s;on, or any number of private per&s;ons, have a right to go to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their fellow &s;ubject in di&s;tre&s;s and danger of his life, when a&s;&s;aulted and in danger from a few or a multitude. <HI>Keyl.</HI> 136.

<P>H. Lord Raymond 1496. His Lord&s;hip &s;ays, "From the&s;e ca&s;es it appears, that though the law of England, is &s;o far peculiarly favourable (I u&s;e the word peculiarly becau&s;e I know of no other law, that makes &s;uch a di&s;tinction between Murder and Man&s;laughter) as to permit the exce&s;s of anger and pa&s;&s;ion (which a man ought to keep under and govern) in &s;ome in&s;tances to extenuate the greate&s;t of private injuries, as the taking away a man's life is; yet in the&s;e ca&s;es, it mu&s;t be &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion, as for the time deprives him of his rea&s;oning faculties.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enter into any enquiry, how far the Admiralty &s;e&s;&s;ions in England, or a Special Court of Admiralty in America ought to proceed by the rules of civil law, though it is a que&s;tion of immen&s;e importance to Americans. But mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve that though the di&s;tinction between Murder and Man&s;laughter is not found in words in the civil law, yet the di&s;tinction between homicide, with deliberation and without deliberation, and on a &s;udden provocation is well known in that law, and the former is puni&s;hed with death, the later, with &s;ome inferior corporal puni&s;hment at the di&s;cretion of the Judges.</P>
<P>Indeed, the civil law is more favourable, and indulgent to &s;udden anger and re&s;ent|ment than the common law, and allows many things to be a provocation &s;ufficient to exempt the per&s;on killing from the <HI>Paena ordinaria,</HI> which is death, which the common law con&s;iders as a &s;light provocation or none at all.</P>

<P><PB N="165" REF="011683_0083_0F87C803E01FE850">An a&s;&s;ault and battery, committed upon a man, in &s;uch a manner as not to endanger his life, is &s;uch a provocation as the law allows to reduce killing, down to the crime of man&s;laughter. Now the law has been made on more con|&s;ideration than we are capable of making at pre&s;ent; the law con&s;iders a man as capable of bearing any thing, and every thing, but blows I may reproach a man as much as I plea&s;e, I may call him a thief, robber, traitor, &s;coundrel, coward, lob&s;ter, bloody back, &amp;c. and if he kills me it will be murder, if nothing el&s;e but words preceed; but if from giving him &s;uch kind of language, I proceed to take him by the no&s;e, or fillip him on the forehead, that is, an a&s;&s;ault! that is a blow; the law will not oblige a man to &s;tand &s;till and bear it; there is the di&s;tinction; hands off, touch me not; as &s;oon as you touch me, if I run you thro' the heart it is but Man&s;laughter; the utility of this di&s;tincti|on, the more you think of it, the more you will be &s;atisfi|ed with it; it is an a&s;&s;ault when ever a blow is &s;truck, let

Be&s;ides, he that was &s;o affronted might rea&s;onably apprehend, that he that treated him in that manner, might have &s;ome further de&s;ign upon him." So that here is the boundary, when a man is a&s;&s;aulted, and kills in con&s;e|quence of that a&s;&s;ault, it is but man&s;laughter; I will ju&s;t read as I go along the defintion of an a&s;&s;ault. 1. Hawkin's Chap. 62. &sect; 1. "An a&s;&s;ault is an attempt or offer, with force or violence, to do a coporal hurt to another; as by &s;tricking at him, with or without a weapon, or pre&s;enting a gun at him, at &s;uch a di&s;tance to which the gun will carry, or pointing a pitch-fork at him, or by any other &s;uch like act done in an angry, threatning manner, &amp;c. But no words can amount to an a&s;&s;ault." Here is the defintion of an a&s;&s;ault, which is a &s;ufficient provocation to &s;often kil|ling down to man&s;laughter. 1. Hawkin's, Chap. 31. &sect; 36. "Neither can he be thought guilty of a greater crime, than man&s;laughter, who finding a man in bed with his wife, or being actually <HI>&s;truck by him,</HI> or <HI>pulled by the no&s;e,</HI> or <HI>filliped upon the forehead,</HI> immediately kills him, or in the defence of his per&s;on from an unlawful arre&s;t; or in the defence of his hou&s;e, from tho&s;e who claiming a title to it, attempt forcibly to enter it, and to that purpo&s;e &s;hoot at it, &amp;c." Every &s;now-ball, oy&s;ter &s;hell, cake of ice, or bit of cinder that was thrown that night, at the Sentinel, was an a&s;&s;ault upon him; every one that was thrown at the party of &s;ol|diers, was an a&s;&s;ault upon them, whether it hit any of
<PB N="167" REF="011683_0084_0F87C804A6BADB20">
them or not. I am guilty of an a&s;&s;ault, if I pre&s;ent a gun at any per&s;on, whether I &s;hoot at him or not, it is an a&s;&s;ault, and if I in&s;ult him in that manner, and he &s;hoots me, it is but man&s;laughter. Fo&s;ter, 295 6. "To what I have of|fered with regard to &s;udden rencounters, let me add, that the blood, already too much heated, kindleth afre&s;h at eve|ry pa&s;s or blow. And in the tumult of the pa&s;&s;ions, in which mere in&s;tinct &s;elf pre&s;ervation, hath no incon&s;ider|able &s;hare, the voice of rea&s;on is not heard. And there|fore, the law in conde&s;en&s;ion to the infirmities of fle&s;h and blood doth extenuate the offence." In&s;olent, &s;currilous, or &s;landerous language, when it preceeds an a&s;&s;ault, aggra|vates it. Fo&s;ter 316. "We all knew that words of re|proach, how grating and offen&s;ive &s;oever, are in the eye of the law, no provocation, in the ca&s;e of voluntary homicide, and yet every man who hath con&s;idered the human frame, or but attended to the workings of his own heart, knoweth, that affronts of that kind, pierce deeper, and &s;timulate in the veins more effectually, than a &s;light injury done to a third per&s;on, tho' under colour of ju&s;tice, po&s;&s;ibly can." I produce this to &s;how the a&s;&s;ault, in this ca&s;e, was aggravated by the &s;cur|rilous language which preceeded it. Such words of reproach, &s;timulate in the veins, and ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;perate the mind, and no doubt if an a&s;&s;ault and battery &s;ucceeds them, killing un|der &s;uch a provocation, is &s;oftened to man&s;laughter, but, killing without &s;uch provocation, makes it murder.</P>

<P>The witne&s;&s;es are confident that they know the pri&s;oners at the barr, and that they were pre&s;ent that night, and of the party; however, it is apparent, that witne&s;&s;es are lia|ble to make mi&s;takes, by a &s;ingle example before you. Mr. <HI>Ba&s;s,</HI> who is a very hone&s;t man, and of good character, &s;wears po&s;itively that the tall man, <HI>Warren,</HI> &s;tood on the right that night, and was the fir&s;t that fired; and I am &s;ure you are &s;atisfied by this time, by many circum&s;tances, that he is totally mi&s;taken in this matter; this you will con&s;i|der at your lei&s;ure. The witne&s;&s;es in general did not know the faces of the&s;e per&s;ons before; very few of them knew the names of them before, they only took notice of their faces that night. How much certainty there is in this evi|dence, I leave you to determine.</P>
<P>There does not &s;eem to me to be any thing very material in the te&s;timony of Mr. <HI>A&s;ton,</HI> except to the identity of <HI>M'Cauley,</HI> and he is the only witne&s;s to that. If you can be &s;atisfied in your own minds, without a doubt, that he knew <HI>M'Cauley</HI> &s;o well as to be &s;ure, you will believe he was there.</P>
<P>The next witne&s;s is <HI>Bridgham,</HI> he &s;ays he &s;aw the tall man <HI>Warren,</HI> but &s;aw another man belonging to the &s;ame regi|ment &s;oon after, &s;o like him, as to make him doubt whether it was <HI>Warren</HI> or not; he thinks he &s;aw the <HI>Corporal,</HI> but is not certain, he &s;ays he was at the corner of the <HI>Cu&s;tom hou&s;e,</HI> this you will take notice of, other witne&s;&s;es &s;wear, he was the remote&s;t man of all from him who fired fir&s;t, and there are other evidences who &s;wear the left man did not fire at all; if <HI>Wemms</HI> did not di&s;charge his gun at all, he could not kill any of the per&s;ons, therefore he mu&s;t be acquitted on the fact of killing; for an intention to kill, is not mur|der nor man&s;laughter, if not carried into execution: The witne&s;s &s;aw numbers of things thrown, and he &s;aw plainly &s;ticks &s;trike the guns, about a dozen per&s;ons with &s;ticks, gave three cheers, and &s;urrounded the party, and &s;truck the guns with their &s;ticks &s;everal blows: This is a witne&s;s for the crown, and his te&s;timony is of great weight for the pri&s;oners; he gives his te&s;timony very &s;en&s;ibly and impar|tially.

<P><HI>Hemmingway,</HI> the &s;heriff's coachman, &s;wears he knew <HI>Kill|roy,</HI> and that he heard him &s;ay, he would never mi&s;s an op|portunity of &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing upon the inhabitants: this is to prove that <HI>Killroy</HI> had preconceived malice in his heart, not indeed again&s;t the unhappy per&s;ons who were killed, but again&s;t the inhabitants in general, that he had the &s;pirit not only of a <HI>Turk</HI> or an <HI>Arab,</HI> but of the devil; but admitting that this te&s;timony is litterally true, and that he had all the malice they would wi&s;h to prove, yet, if he was a&s;&s;aulted that night, and his life in danger, he had a right to defend him&s;elf as well as another man; if he had malice before, it does not take away from him the right of defending him&s;elf again&s;t any unju&s;t aggre&s;&s;or. But it is not at all improbable, that there was &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tanding about the&s;e loo&s;e expre&s;&s;ions; perhaps the man had no thoughts of what his words might import; many a man in his cups, or in anger, which is a &s;hort fit of madne&s;s, hath uttered the ra&s;he&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, who had no &s;uch &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition in general: &s;o that there is but little weight in expre&s;&s;ions uttered at a kitching fire, before a maid and a coachman, where he might think him&s;elf at liberty to talk as much like a bully, a fool, and a madman as he plea&s;ed, and that no evil would come of it. Strictly &s;peaking, he might mean no more than this, that he would not mi&s;s an opportunity of firing on the inhabitants, if he was attacked by them in &s;uch a manner as to ju&s;tify it: &s;oldiers have &s;ometimes a|voided opportunities of firing, when they would have been ju&s;tified, if they had fired.

peril; but &s;till what he &s;aid, amounts in &s;trictne&s;s, to no more than this, "If the inhabitants make an attack on me, I will not bear from them what I have done already;" or I ill bear no more, than what I am obliged by law to bear. No doubt it was under the fret of his &s;pirits, the indignation, mortification, grief and &s;hame, that he had &s;uffered a de|feat at the Rope-walks; it was ju&s;t after an account of an aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y was publi&s;hed here, betwixt the &s;oldiers and inhabitants at <HI>New York.</HI> There was a little before the 5th of <HI>March,</HI> much noi&s;e in this town, and a pompuous account in the news papers, of a victory obtained by the inhabitants there over the &s;oldiers; which doubtle&s;s excited the re&s;entment of the &s;oldiers here, as well as exultations among &s;ome &s;orts of the inhabitants: and the ringing of the bells here, was probably copied from <HI>New York,</HI> a wretched example in this, and in two other in&s;tances at lea&s;t: the defeat of the &s;oldiers at the Rope-walks, was about that time too, and if he did, after that, u&s;e &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, it ought not to weigh too much in this ca&s;e. It can &s;carcely amount to proof that he harboured any &s;ettled malice again&s;t the peo|ple in general. Other witne&s;&s;es are introduced to &s;how that <HI>Killroy</HI> had be&s;ides his general ill will again&s;t every body, particular malice again&s;t Mr. <HI>Gray,</HI> whom he killed, as <HI>Langford</HI> &s;wears.</P>
<P>Some of the witne&s;&s;es, have &s;worn that <HI>Gray</HI> was active in the battle at the Rope walks, and that <HI>Killroy</HI> was once there, from whence the Council for the Crown would infer, that <HI>Killroy</HI>; in <HI>King &s;treet,</HI> on the 5th of <HI>March</HI> in the night, kenw <HI>Gray</HI> whom he had &s;een at the Rope-walks before, and took that opportunity to gratify his preconceived malice; but if this is all true, it will not take away from him his ju&s;tification, excu&s;e, or extenuation, if he had any.&mdash; The rule of the law is, if there has been mallice between two, and at a di&s;tant time afterwards they met, and one of them a&s;&s;aults the other's life, or only a&s;&s;aults him, and he kills in con&s;equence of it, the law pre&s;umes the killing was in &s;elf defence, or upon the provocation, not on ac|count of the antecedent malice. If therefore the a&s;&s;ault upon <HI>Killroy</HI> was &s;o violent as to endanger his life, he had as good a right to defend him&s;elf, as much as if he never had before conceived any malice again&s;t the people in ge|ral, or Mr. <HI>Gray</HI> in particular. If the a&s;&s;ault upon him, was &s;uch as to amount only to a provocation, not to a ju&s;ti|fication,
<PB N="173" REF="011683_0087_0F87C809C6437C30">
his crime will be man&s;laughter only. However, it does not appear, that he knew Mr. <HI>Gray</HI>; none of the witne&s;&s;es pretend to &s;ay he knew him, or that he ever &s;aw him. It is true they were both at the Rope-walks at one time, but there were &s;o many combatants on each &s;ide, that it is not even probable that <HI>Killroy</HI> &s;hould know them all, and no witne&s;s &s;ays there was any rencounter there between them two.

<P>Having premi&s;ed the&s;e things, I &s;hall ob&s;erve to you, the &s;everal que&s;tions that ari&s;e in this ca&s;e; and point out to you the manner in which I think they may be be&s;t con&s;ider|ed and determined.</P>
<P>The principal que&s;tions are the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Whether the five per&s;ons &s;aid to be murdered, were in fact killed? And if &s;o.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Whether they, or either of them were killed by the pri&s;oners, or either of them? And if they were, then</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Whether &s;uch killing was ju&s;tifiable, excu&s;able, or felouious? And if the latter,</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Whether it was man&s;laughter or murder?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, you have not only the corouer's inque&s;t, but the te&s;timony of &s;o many witne&s;&s;es, that the five per&s;ons were &s;hot and thereby mortally wounded in the night of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, and that &s;ome of them died in&s;tantly, and the re&s;t in a few days after, that you doubtle&s;s will be &s;atisfied they were all killed. And the &s;ame evidence mu&s;t I think al&s;o convince you, that they were all killed by the party of &s;oldiers that were at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e</HI> that night, or by &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>Whether the pri&s;oners were there, will therefore be your next enquiry; for if either of them was not, he mu&s;t be ac|quitted. You have the te&s;timony of <HI>Bridgham</HI> and <HI>Simp&s;on</HI> as to <HI>Wemms</HI>; of <HI>Danbrooke</HI> and <HI>Simp&s;on</HI> as to <HI>Hartegan,</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> as to <HI>M'Cauley</HI>; of <HI>Simp&s;on, Langford.

But if you are &s;atisfied upon the evidence, that all the pri&s;oners were there, yet, as each pri&s;oner is &s;everally charged with having killed the&s;e five per&s;ons, and by his plea has denied the charge, you mu&s;t be fully &s;atisfied upon the evidence given you, with regard to each pri&s;oner, that he in particular,
<PB N="188" REF="011683_0095_0F87C814D3744150">
did <HI>in fact,</HI> or <HI>in con&s;ideration of law,</HI> kill one or more of the&s;e per&s;ons that were &s;lain, or he mu&s;t be acquitted.</P>
<P>The way therefore to determine this, will be for you to name &s;ome one of the pri&s;oners, and then con&s;ider, whe|ther it appears upon the evidence in the ca&s;e, that he did <HI>in fact</HI> kill <HI>Maverick?</HI> And then, whether upon the evi|dence it appears, he <HI>in fact</HI> killed <HI>Gray?</HI> And &s;o enquire in the &s;ame manner, whether he did <HI>in fact</HI> kill either of the other three per&s;ons? And having noted how it appears up|on the evidence with regard to him; you mu&s;t then pro|ceed in like manner with each of the other pri&s;oners; and if upon a full con&s;ideration of the evidence in the ca&s;e, you &s;hould be in doubt, as to any one of the pri&s;ouers having <HI>in fact</HI> killed either of the per&s;ons that were &s;lain, you mu&s;t con&s;ider whether he did it <HI>in con&s;ideration of law?</HI> Now all that are pre&s;ent, aiding and abetting one per&s;on in killing another, do, in judgment of law, kill him. The &s;troke of one is, in con&s;ideration of law, the &s;troke of all. When a num|ber of per&s;ons a&s;&s;emble together to do an unlawful act, and in pro&s;ecution of that de&s;ign, one of them kills a man, all the re&s;t of the company are in law con&s;idered as abetting him to do it.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1. <HI>Hale.</HI> 440, 1. <HI>Fo&s;t.</HI> 351,</NOTE></P>
<P>You mu&s;t therefore enquire how, and for what purpo&s;e, the pri&s;oners came together at the <HI>Cu&s;tom hou&s;e,</HI> and what they did there before the&s;e per&s;on were killed?</P>
<P>The Council for the pri&s;oners &s;ay, that, if they were at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e</HI> that night, they went there by order of the <HI>Captain</HI> of the <HI>Main-guard,</HI> to &s;upport and protect the Sentry, who was in&s;ulted, a&s;&s;aulted and abu&s;ed by a con&s;iderable number of people, a&s;&s;embled for that purpo&s;e; but as this is denied by the Council for the Crown, it will be pro|per to con&s;ider whether, a Sentry was duly placed at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e?</HI> And if &s;o, whether he was attacked? And if &s;o, whether the pri&s;oners went by order of the <HI>Captain,</HI> to &s;upport and protect him?</P>

Upon this, there|fore

I would ob&s;erve, that as the main de&s;ign of &s;ociety, is the protection of individuals by the united &s;trength of the whole community; &s;o for the &s;ake of unanimity, &s;trength and di&s;patch, the &s;upreme executive power is by the Briti&s;h con&s;titution ve&s;ted in a &s;ingle per&s;on, the King or Queen. This &s;ingle per&s;on has the &s;ole power of rai&s;ing fleets or ar|mies; and the Statute of 13 <HI>Car</HI> 2. c. 6. declares, That within all his Maje&s;ty's realms and <HI>dominions,</HI> the &s;ole &s;u|preme government, command and <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of the militia, and of <HI>all forces</HI> by &s;ea and land, and <HI>all &s;orts</HI> and <HI>places of &s;trength</HI> is, and by the law of <HI>England</HI> ever was, the un|doubted right of his Maje&s;ty and his royal Predece&s;&s;ors, Kings and Queens of <HI>England.</HI> And as <HI>Charles</HI> the Second had this right as King of <HI>England,</HI> it of cour&s;e comes to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and our pre&s;ent Soverereign Lord the King, now hath it.</P>
<P>Indeed the Bill of Rights declares among other things, That the rai&s;ing or keeping a &s;tanding army, within the kingdom, in a time of peace, unle&s;s with the con&s;ent of Parliament, is again&s;t law. And it is &s;aid, that upon the &s;ame principles whereon that declaration was founded, it is alike unlawful to be doue in any other part of the King's dominious. But be that as it may, the Mutiny Acts annu|ally made, &s;hew the con&s;ent of Parliament, that the King in time of peace &s;hould keep up a &s;tanding army not only in the Kingdom, but in <HI>America</HI> al&s;o. They not only a&s;cer|tain the number of troops that &s;hall be kept up, but pro|vide for the regulation of &s;uch of the King's troops as are in <HI>America.</HI> And therefore as by the&s;e acts the King is im|powered to keep up the&s;e troops, and he, by common law, has the command and di&s;po&s;ition of all forces by &s;ea and land within his dominions, and is the principal con&s;ervator of the peace, he doubtle&s;s, well might &s;end &s;uch part of tho&s;e troops to this part of his dominions, in order to re|&s;tore the public peace, or to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t the civil Magi&s;|trate in pre&s;erving of it, as he judged nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e; and if you &s;hould think there was no occa&s;ion for &s;ending any troops here, for either of tho&s;e purpo&s;es, that will not alter the ca&s;e, becau&s;e the King being the proper judge in that matter, the validity of his order will not de|pend upon the truth of the repre&s;entations whereon it is founded. The acts not only fix the number of troops to be kept up, but al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;h a law martial for their govern|ment.
<PB N="190" REF="011683_0096_0F87C815D6C85DF0">
Among other things, the Acts &s;ubject every officer or &s;oldier that &s;leeps on his po&s;t, or leaves it before he is re|lieved, or di&s;obeys the <HI>lawful</HI> command of his &s;uperior of|ficer, to &s;uch puni&s;hment as a Court Martial &s;hall inflict,&mdash; though it extend to death it&s;elf. The&s;e troops are, and e|ver &s;ince they came here, have been under this martial law, and &s;ubject to as &s;trict regulation, as in time of war.

If &s;o, you have no rea&s;on to doubt but that it was legally done.</P>
<P>Your next enquiry then will be, whether the Sentry &s;o placed at the <HI>Cu&s;tom hou&s;e</HI> was attacked? Many witne&s;&s;es have &s;worn that he was. But the Council for the Crown &s;ay, the contrary appears by the te&s;timony of Col. <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> and others.</P>
<P>It is with you to determine this matter upon the whole of the evidence given you. In doing it you ought to recon|cile the &s;everal te&s;timonies, if by any rea&s;onable con&s;tructi|on of the words it may be done.&mdash; Where &s;ome witne&s;&s;es &s;wear they &s;aw &s;uch a thing done, and others &s;wear they were pre&s;ent and did not &s;ee it: if the thing &s;aid to be done be &s;uch as it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ome might &s;ee and others not, by rea&s;on of their want of ob&s;ervation, or particular attention to other matters there, as both may be true, you ought to &s;uppo&s;e them to be &s;o, rather than pre|&s;ume that any of the witne&s;&s;es &s;wear fal&s;ly. But if witne&s;|&s;es contradict each other, &s;o that their te&s;timonies cannot be reconciled, you mu&s;t then con&s;ider the number of the witne&s;&s;es on each &s;ide, their ability, integrity, indifference as to the point in que&s;tion, and the probability or improbability ari&s;ing from the nature of the thing in que&s;tion, and upon the whole &s;ettle the fact as you verily believe it to be. If you find the Sentry was attacked, the next thing to be con|&s;idered is, whether the pri&s;oners went to protect him, and it &s;o, whether it was lawful for them &s;o to do. There is a great difference between a common affray, and attacking the King's forces. I think the law in that regard ought to be more generally known here than it &s;eems to be.

<P>And it is &s;aid, that while they were at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,</HI> before they fired, &s;ome of them attempted with their bayo|nets to &s;tab every one they could come at, without any rea|&s;on at all for &s;o doing. Such conduct to be &s;ure can nei|ther be ju&s;tified nor excu&s;ed. But as the time was &s;o very &s;hort, and &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es declare the people were crouding upon the &s;oldiers, and that they were moving

their guns backwards and forwards crying &s;tand off, &s;tand off, without moving from their &s;tation, you will con&s;ider whether this may not be what other witne&s;&s;es call an at|tempt to &s;tab the people. But, be that as it may, if the party was a lawful a&s;&s;embly before, this not being the act of the whole, would not make it unlawful. The Council for the Crown in&s;i&s;t that the firing upon the people was an unlawful act, in di&s;turbance of the peace, and as the par|ty fired &s;o near together, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed they previou&s;|ly agreed to do it; that agreement made them an unlawful a&s;&s;embly, if they were not &s;o before, and being &s;o when they fired, all are chargeable with the killing by any one or more of them. However ju&s;t this rea&s;oning may be, where there is no apparent cau&s;e for their firing, yet it will not hold good where there is. If each of the party had been at the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;o a&s;&s;aulted, as that it would have ju&s;tified his killing the a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ilant in defence of his own life, and thereupon each of them had at that &s;ame in&s;tant fired up|on and killed the per&s;on that a&s;&s;aulted him, &s;urely it would not have been evidence of a previous agreement to fire, or prove them to be an unlawful a&s;&s;embly; nor would it have been evidence of &s;uch agreement if the attack was not &s;uch as would ju&s;tify the firing and killing, though it was &s;uch an a&s;&s;ault as would alleviate the offence, and reduce it to man&s;laughter, &s;ince there would be <HI>as ap|parent</HI> a cau&s;e of the firing in one ca&s;e as in the other, and though not <HI>&s;o good</HI> a cau&s;e, yet &s;uch an one as the law, in conde&s;cen&s;ion to human frailty greatly regards.&mdash; You will therefore carefully con&s;ider what the &s;everal wit|ne&s;&s;es have &s;worn, with regard to the a&s;&s;ault made upon the party of &s;oldiers at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,</HI> and if you thereupon believe they were, before, and at the time of their firing attacked by &s;uch numbers, and in &s;uch a violent manner, as many of the witne&s;&s;es have po&s;itively &s;worn, you will be able to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e for their firing &s;o near together, as they did, without &s;uppo&s;ing a previous agreement &s;o to do. But it is &s;aid that if their firing as they did, don't prove a previous agreement to do it, yet it is good evidence of an actual abetment to fire, as one by firing encourages the o|thers to do the like. As neither of the &s;oldiers fired more than once, it is evident that he who fired la&s;t, could not thereby in fact, abet or encourage the firing of any of tho&s;e who fired before him, and &s;o it cannot be evidence of
<PB N="193" REF="011683_0098_0F87C8169D3A0670">
&s;uch abetment. And if he who fired fir&s;t and killed, can ju&s;tify it, becau&s;e it was lawful for him &s;o to do, &s;urely that &s;ame lawful act cannot be evidence of an unlawful abetment. And though he who fir&s;t fired and killed, may not be able to ju&s;tify the doing it, yet if it appears he had &s;uch a cau&s;e for the killing as will reduce it to Man&s;laugh|ter, it would be &s;trange indeed if that &s;ame act &s;hould be evidence of his abetting another who killed without provo|cation, &s;o as to make him who fired fir&s;t guilty of murder. The &s;ame may be &s;aid as to all the intermediate firings: and, as the evidence &s;tands, I don't think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay how it would be in ca&s;e the fir&s;t per&s;on fired with little or no provocation. If therefore this party of &s;oldiers, when at the <HI>Cu&s;tom hou&s;e,</HI> were a lawful a&s;&s;embly and continued &s;o until they fired, and their firing was not an actual <HI>unlawful</HI> abetment of each other to fire, nor evidence of it, they cannot be &s;aid to have <HI>in con&s;ideration of law</HI> killed tho&s;e five per&s;ons or either of them, but it mu&s;t re&s;t on the evidence of the actual killing: and, if &s;o, neither of the pri&s;oners can be found guilty thereof, unle&s;s it appears not only that he was of the party, but that he in particular <HI>in fact</HI> did kill one or more of the per&s;ons &s;lain. That the five per&s;ons were killed by the party of &s;oldiers or &s;ome of them, &s;eems clear upon the evidence, and indeed is not di&s;puted.</P>
<P>Some witne&s;&s;es have been produced to prove that <HI>Montgo|mery</HI> killed <HI>Attucks</HI>; and <HI>Langford</HI> &s;wears <HI>Kulroy</HI> killed <HI>Gray,</HI> but none of the witne&s;&s;es undertake to &s;ay that either of the other pri&s;oners in particular killed either of the other three per&s;ons, or that all of them did it. On the contrary it &s;eems that one of the &s;ix did not fire, and that another of them fired at a boy as he was running down the &s;treet, but mi&s;&s;ed him (if he had killed him, as the evidence &s;tands, it would have been murder) but the witne&s;&s;es are not a|greed as to the per&s;on who fired at the boy, or as to him who did not fire at all. It is highly probable, from the places where the five per&s;ons killed fell and their wounds, that they were killed by the di&s;charge of five &s;everal guns only. If you are upon the evidence, &s;atisfied of that, and al|&s;o that <HI>Montgomery</HI> killed <HI>Attucks,</HI> and <HI>Killroy Gray,</HI> it will thence follow that the other three, were killed, not by the other &s;ix pri&s;oners, but by three of them only: and there|fore they cannot all be found guilty of it. And as the evi|dence does not &s;hew which three killed the three, nor that
<PB N="194" REF="011683_0098_0F87C8169D3A0670">
either of the &s;ix in particular killed either of the three, you cannot find either of the &s;ix guilty of killing them or either them <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Hale</HI> 442.</NOTE> If you are &s;atisfied, upon the evidence gi|ven you, that <HI>Montgomery</HI> killed <HI>Attucks,</HI> you will proceed to inquire whether it was ju&s;tifiable, excu&s;able, or felonious homicide, and it the latter whether it was maliciou&s;ly done or not. As he is charged with murder, if the fact of killing be proved, all the circum&s;tances of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> or <HI>infirmity</HI> are to be &s;atisfactorily proved by him, unle&s;s they ari&s;e out of the evidence produced again&s;t him, for the law pre&s;umeth the fact to have been founded in malice untill the contrary ap|pears.<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> 255.</NOTE></P>
<P>You will therefore, carefully con&s;ider and weigh the whole of the evidence given you re&s;pecting the attack, made upon the party of &s;oldiers <HI>in general,</HI> and upon <HI>Mont|gomery</HI> in particular. In doing it, you will ob&s;erve the rules I have before mentioned, and not forget the part that &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es took in this unhappy affair, and if upon the whole it appears to you, that <HI>Montgomery</HI> was attacked, in &s;uch a violent manner, as that his life was in immediate danger, or that he had &s;ufficient rea&s;on to think it was, and he thereupon fired and killed <HI>Attucks,</HI> for the pre&s;ervation of his own life, it was ju&s;tifiable homicide; and he ought to be acquitted.&mdash;If you do not believe that was, the ca&s;e, but upon the evidence are &s;atisfied, that he was by that a&s;|&s;embly, a&s;&s;aulted with clubs and other weapons, and there|upon fired at the rioters and killed <HI>Attucks</HI>: then you ought to find him guilty of man&s;laughter only. But if upon the evidence you believe, that <HI>Montgomery,</HI> without being previ|ou&s;ly a&s;&s;aulted, fired, and killed <HI>Attucks</HI>: then you will find him guilty of muder But you mu&s;t know, that if this party of &s;oldiers <HI>in general</HI> were pelted, with &s;now-balls, pieces of ice and &s;ticks, <HI>in anger,</HI> this, without more, amounts to an a&s;&s;ault, not only upon tho&s;e that were in fact &s;truck, but upon the whole party; and is &s;uch an a&s;&s;ault as will reduce the killing to man&s;laughter. And if you believe, what &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es have &s;worn, that the people a|round the &s;oldiers, and many of them armed with clubs, crouded upon the &s;oldiers, and with the cry of, "Ru&s;h on, Kill them, Kill them, Knock them over," did in fact ru&s;h on, &s;trike at them with their clubs, and give <HI>Montgomery</HI>
<PB N="195" REF="011683_0099_0F87C8176229D1B0">
&s;uch a blow, as to knock him down, as &s;ome of the witne&s;|&s;es &s;ay, or to make him &s;ally, or &s;tagger, as others &s;ay&mdash;it will be &s;ufficient to &s;how, that his life was in immediate danger, or that he had &s;ufficient rea&s;on to think &s;o.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, a doctrine, has of late been advanced, "that &s;oldiers while on duty, may upon <HI>no occa&s;ion whatever</HI> fire upon their fellow &s;ubjects, without the order of a civil magi&s;trate." This may po&s;&s;ibly account, for &s;ome of tho&s;e who attacked the &s;olders, &s;aying to them, "You dare not fire, we know you dare not fire."&mdash;But it ought to be known, that the law doth not countenance &s;uch an ab&s;urd doctrine. A man by becoming a &s;oldier, doth not thereby lo&s;e the right of &s;elf-defence which is founded in the law of nature. Where any one is, without his own default, reduced to &s;uch circum&s;tances, as that the laws of &s;ociety cannot avail him, the law con&s;iders him, "as <HI>&s;till in that in&s;tance</HI> under the protection of the law of nature."<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> 274, 5.</NOTE> This rule extends to &s;oldiers as well as others; nay, while &s;oldiers are in the immediate &s;ervice of the King, and the regular di&s;charge of their duty, they rather come within the <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> of civil officers and their a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and &s;o are a|like under the <HI>peculiar</HI> protection of the law.</P>
<P>If you are &s;atisfied upon the evidence, that <HI>Killroy</HI> killed <HI>Gray,</HI> you will then enquire, whether it was ju&s;tifiable, ex|cu&s;able or felonious homicide, and if the latter, whether it was with, or without malice. If the attack was upon the party of &s;oldiers <HI>in general,</HI> and in the manner I have ju&s;t mentioned, as &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es &s;ay it was, it is equal|ly an a&s;&s;ault upon all, whether all were in fact &s;truck, or not, and makes no material difference, as to their re&s;pec|tive right of firing: for a man is not obliged to wait un|til he is killed, or &s;truck, before he makes u&s;e of the nece&s;|&s;ary means of &s;elf defence. If the blows with clubs were, by an enraged multitude, aimed at the party <HI>in gene|ral,</HI> each one might rea&s;onably think his own life in dan|ger; for though he e&s;caped the fir&s;t blow, he might rea|&s;onably expect more would follow, and could have no a&s;|&s;urance, that he &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to e&s;cape all of them.</P>
<P>And therefore, I do not &s;ee but that <HI>Killroy</HI> is upon the &s;ame &s;ooting with <HI>Montgomery;</HI> and your verdict mu&s;t be
<PB N="196" REF="011683_0099_0F87C8176229D1B0">
the &s;ame as to both, unle&s;s what <HI>Hemmingway</HI> &s;wears <HI>Killroy</HI> &s;aid, or the affray at the Rope-walk, or both, materially vary the ca&s;e. <HI>Hemmingway</HI> &s;wears, that he and <HI>Killroy</HI> were talking about the town's people and the &s;oldiers, and that <HI>Killroy</HI> &s;aid. "He never would mi&s;s an opportunity, when he had one, to fire on the inhabitants, and that he had wanted to have an opportunity, ever &s;ince he landed." But he &s;ays, he cannot remember what words immediately preceded or followed, or at what particular time the words were uttered, nor does he know whether <HI>Killroy</HI> was jocu|lar, or not. If the witne&s;s is not mi&s;taken as to the words, the &s;peech was at lea&s;t, very imprudent and fooli&s;h. How|ever, if <HI>Killroy,</HI> either in Je&s;t or in earne&s;t, uttered tho&s;e words, yet if the a&s;&s;ault upon him was &s;uch, as would ju&s;|tify his firing and killing, or alleviate it &s;o as to make it but man&s;laughter, that will not inhance the killing to mur|der. And though it has been &s;worn that <HI>Killroy</HI> and other &s;oldiers, had a quarrel with <HI>Gray</HI> and others, at the Rope|walk, a few days before the 5th <HI>March,</HI> yet it is not certain that <HI>Killroy</HI> then knew <HI>Gray,</HI> or armed at him in particular: But if <HI>Gray</HI> encouraged the a&s;&s;ault by clapping the a&s;&s;ail|ants on their backs, as <HI>Hink<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey</HI> &s;wears he did, and <HI>Killroy</HI> &s;aw this and knew him to be one of tho&s;e that were concerned in the affray at the Rope walk, this very circum&s;tance would have a natural tendency, to rai&s;e <HI>Killroy</HI>'s pa&s;&s;ions, and throw him off his guard, much more than if the &s;ame things had been done by another per&s;on.&mdash;In the tumult of pa&s;&s;ion the voice of rea&s;on is not heard, and it is owing to the allowance the law makes for human frailty, that all unlawful voluntary homicide is not deemed mur|der.

<P>There have been attempts to prejudice the minds of the good people of this province again&s;t the pri&s;oners at the bar, and I cannot help taking notice of one in particular, (which included al&s;o an in&s;ult on this Court) publi&s;hed in one of the Weekly Papers the day before this trial was to have come on. I think I never &s;aw greater mali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nity of heart expre&s;&s;ed in any one piece; a malignity blacker than ever was expre&s;&s;ed by the &s;avages of the wilderne&s;s, for they are in the untutored &s;tate of nature and are their own aven|gers of wrongs done to them; but we are under the laws of &s;ociety, which laws are the avengers of wrongs done to us: I am &s;orry I am obliged to &s;ay it, but there are per&s;ons among us who have endeavoured to bring this Supreme Court of Law into contempt, and even to de&s;troy the Law it&s;elf: there may come a time when the&s;e per&s;ons them&s;elves may want the protection of the law and of this Court, which they now endeavour to de&s;troy, and which, if they &s;ucceed in their attempts. It may be too late for them to repair to for ju&s;tice: but I tru&s;t, that the ancient virtue and &s;pirit of this people will return and the law be e&s;tabli&s;hed on a firm ba&s;is. If you, Gentlemen, have &s;een or read any of the libels which have been publi&s;hed, and have imbibed prejudices of any &s;ort, I do now charge you, in that &s;acred Name which you have in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner invoked for the faithful di&s;charge of your pre&s;ent tru&s;t, to dive&s;t your minds of every thing that may tend to bia&s;s them in this cau&s;e: it is your duty to fix your eyes &s;olely on the &s;cales of ju&s;tice and as the

<P>Gentlemen, the pri&s;oners at the bar are indicted, with others, for the murder of five different per&s;ons; viz. <HI>Car|rol</HI> for the murder of <HI>James Caldwell; Kulroy</HI> for the mur|der of <HI>Samuel Maverick; White</HI> for the murder of <HI>Patrick Carr; Hartegan</HI> for the murder of <HI>Samuel Gray; Warren</HI> for the murder of <HI>Cri&s;pus Attucks.</HI> Ob&s;erve, that the five pri|&s;oners I have now named are &s;everally charged as principals in the different &s;uppo&s;ed murders, and the others as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iding and abetting, which in the &s;en&s;e of the law makes the latter principals in the &s;econd degree.</P>

<P>It would be too tedious to recite the numbers of te&s;timo|nies to prove a de&s;ign to attack the &s;oldiers: I have &s;elected a few, which &s;eem to prove the intent, for there are no le&s;s than <HI>thirty eight</HI> witne&s;&s;es to this fact, <HI>&s;ix</HI> of whom the council for the King have produced.

<P>I will return now to the &s;oldiers and view their behaviour whil&s;t they were going upon duty at the <HI>Cu&s;tom hou&s;e,</HI> and whil&s;t they were there. As they were going from the <HI>Main-guard</HI> to their po&s;t, to &s;upport the Sentry, (who by the way behaved with a good temper of mind, in endea|vouring to avoid a di&s;pute by attempting to get into the <HI>Cu&s;tom hou&s;e,</HI> which he was by no means obliged to do,) I &s;ay, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s they were going down, <HI>Nathaniel Fo&s;dick</HI> &s;ays, <HI>they bid him make way</HI> but he refu&s;ed: in&s;tead of forcing him to give way, he &s;ays, <HI>they gave way to him,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed to their po&s;t; when they got there, they loaded; and <HI>John Gridley</HI> &s;ays, that, <HI>whil&s;t they were loading, he pa&s;&s;ed between the fires and they put up their guns to let him pa&s;s.</HI> I cannot find, up|on examining the te&s;timonies, that any one &s;oldier &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red from his po&s;t, and indeed it might have been fatal to him to have broke his orders; but on the contrary, it hath been &s;aid, that had they &s;tepped forward, they might have kil|led the people, but that they only pu&s;hed their bayonets as they &s;tood, to keep off the people who were pre&s;&s;ing on them; at the &s;ame time, bidding them keep off.</P>
<P>Now con&s;ider whether the pri&s;oners had any ju&s;t provo|cation to fire upon ihe inhabitants, for that &s;ome of them did fire, you can be in no doubt There are <HI>twenty five</HI> wit|ne&s;&s;es who have &s;worn to <HI>ice, &s;now-balls, &s;ticks,</HI> &amp;c. being thrown at the pri&s;oners, <HI>ten</HI> of whom, are wine&s;&s;es for the Crown. There are nigh <HI>thirty</HI> witne&s;&s;es who have &s;worn to words of provocation uttered again&s;t the pri&s;oners, as dar|ing them to fire, and threatning to kill them; but you mu&s;t remember that words only, are no provocation in law to ju&s;tify the killing of a per&s;on; but if threatning expre&s;&s;i|ons are attended with an attempt on the life of a man, in &s;uch a ca&s;e a killing may be ju&s;tified; and if any &s;uch facts appear in this trial, you mu&s;t con&s;ider them thorough|ly. And here, I would take notice of the te&s;timonies of &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> that although they were clo&s;e to the &s;oldiers, they &s;aw nothing of any kind thrown at them, nor heard any <HI>huzza</HI> or a <HI>threatning</HI>: nay, one witne&s;s is &s;o di&s;tinct, as to tell, in a cloud of &s;moak, which guns killed the different per&s;ons.

<P>Ye have one difficulty to &s;olve, Gentlemen, and that is, that there were <HI>five</HI> per&s;ons killed, and here are <HI>eight</HI> &s;oldiers charged with murdering them.

<P><PB N="206" REF="011683_0104_0F87C7D0204DD238">As to <HI>Killroy,</HI> there have been &s;tronger attempts to prove him guilty of murder than any oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r. <HI>Two</HI> witne&s;&s;es have &s;worn, that his bayonet was bloody next morning; but no|thing hath been offered in evidence to prove how it came &s;o; I have only one way to account for it; if it was bloo|dy, <HI>viz.</HI> that by pu&s;hing to keep off <HI>Nathaniel Fo&s;dick</HI> it might become &s;o by wounding him in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m. <HI>Nicholas Ferreter,</HI> who the week before b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at one of the &s;ol|diers at the Rope walks, &s;ays further, that <HI>Killroy</HI> was then at the Rope walks; but at the &s;ame time he &s;ays, that <HI>Kill|roy</HI> uttered no threatnings ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the Rope-makers to com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> out.

<P>As I &s;aid at fir&s;t, this cau&s;e is of the la&s;t importance to the pri&s;oners, their lives or deaths depend upon your ver|dict; and may you be conducted by the SUPREME WISDOM to return &s;uch an one, as that your hearts may not re|proach you &s;o long as you live, and as &s;hall acquit you at

<P>I am an apprentice to Mr. <HI>Edward Manwarring.</HI> On the evening of the 5th <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, I was at Mr. <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s in <HI>Back-&s;treet,</HI> at the <HI>North end,</HI> where my ma&s;ter then lodg|ed, Mr. <HI>Hud&s;on</HI> and his wife were at home; when the bells rung I ran into <HI>King &s;treet,</HI> and to the door of the <HI>Cu&s;tom|hou&s;e</HI> which was on a jarr partly open, and a young man one <HI>Green,</HI> he with one eye, (<HI>pointing to Hammond Green</HI>) o|pened the door and pulled me in; two or three gentlemen came down &s;tairs, and one of them a tall man, pulled me up &s;tairs, and &s;aid to me, you mu&s;t fire, the tall man gave me a gun, and &s;aid to me "<HI>if you don't fire I'll kill you.</HI>"&mdash; I went up &s;tairs and &s;tood at a front window in the cham|ber, and the tall man loaded two guns with two balls each, and I fired them both; as &s;oon as I had fired one gun, he, the tall man, &s;aid again to me, "<HI>if you don't fire I will kill
<PB N="213" REF="011683_0107_0F87C7D67222EE30">
you.</HI>" He had a cane with a &s;word in it in his hand, and compelled me to fire both the guns. After I had fired the&s;e two guns, Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI> fired one gun al&s;o out of the &s;ame window. The tall man loaded the three guns, and I &s;ee him put the balls into each of them and heard them go gown. The two guns I fired, I pointed up the &s;treet and in the air. When my ma&s;ter Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI> pointed his gun out of the window I was in the room, but went out and was on the &s;tairs before his gun went off, I heard it, but did not &s;ee it. As &s;oon as I had fired, the tall man took me down &s;tairs, and &s;aid he would give me money if I would not tell: I replied, I did not want any money, but if I was called before the Ju&s;tices, I would tell the truth. There were a great many people in the hou&s;e, and a num|ber of people round me in the chamber where I fired, I can't tell the preci&s;e number, but there were more than ten, Mr. <HI>Munro</HI> and <HI>Hammond Green</HI> were in the hou&s;e below &s;tairs, Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI> was in the chamber when all the three guns were lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded and fired, there was the &s;pace of a mi|nute and an half between the &s;econd gun I fired, and the third which my Ma&s;ter fired. There was a candle in the chamber, but I cannot tell whether there were one or two windows in it. When I came up into the chamber, there were two guns in it, I fired twice out of the &s;ame gun, but I cannot tell whether Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI> fired the &s;ame gun I did. At the time I and my ma&s;ter fired, the &s;treet below was full of people, and the mob were throwing &s;ticks, &s;now-balls, &amp;c. It was pretty dark, but I don't know but there might be a little moon. I can't tell whether the guns my ma&s;ter and I fired, were fired before or after the firing by the &s;oldiers. When I went from Mr. <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s to the <HI>Cu&s;tom hou&s;e,</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed through the lane that leads from the <HI>Market</HI> to the <HI>Cu&s;tom hou&s;e,</HI> (<HI>Royal-exchange-lane</HI>) and I did not &s;ee the Sentry box or any &s;oldiers near the <HI>Cu&s;tom hou&s;e</HI>; there were many people round there in the &s;treet. Immedi|ately after I went down &s;tairs, I went out of the hou&s;e and &s;aw a great number of people throwing &s;now-balls and &s;ticks, but I &s;aw no &s;oldiers. I returned to Mr. <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s hou&s;e, Mr <HI>Hud&s;on</HI> and his wife were then at home, and no other per&s;on in the hou&s;e. Upon being again a&s;ked where he was when he heard the report of his ma&s;ter's gun? Says, he was quite down &s;tairs. Upon being a&s;ked whether he was not &s;oon after his commitment taken out of goal and
<PB N="214" REF="011683_0108_0F87C7D7035D5018">
examined by Mr. <HI>Molineux</HI>? Says, he was in the goal|er's hou&s;e with Mrs. <HI>Otis</HI> the pri&s;on keeper's wife, Mr. <HI>Wal|lis,</HI> deputy &s;heriff, and Mr. <HI>Molineux,</HI> and that the latter told him to tell the truth: and that this was previous to his examination before the Ju&s;tices.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Quincy</HI> declaring he had no further evidence to pro|duce on the part of the Crown. The pri&s;oners de&s;ired the following witne&s;&s;es might be &s;worn and examined, which was done accordingly.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Edward Paine, George Bethane,</HI> and <HI>Edward Davis,</HI> Mer|chants, and <HI>Harri&s;on Gray</HI> junr. they te&s;tified, That they &s;tood oppo&s;ite the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e</HI> on the evening of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, when the firing was in <HI>King &s;treet</HI> that their faces were towards the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e.</HI> That the moon &s;hone &s;trong on the hou&s;e, that they did not &s;ee the balcony door of the <HI>Cu&s;tom hou&s;e</HI> open that evening, or any per&s;on in the balcony, or any window in the front of the hou&s;e open, or guns fired from either the balcony or any of the windows in the front of the hou&s;e, and are fully &s;atisfied no &s;uch thing could have happened while the &s;oldiers were there with|out their ob&s;erving it. That they &s;tood oppo&s;ite the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e</HI> in full view of it from he time the &s;oldiers fir&s;t came down there until all the guns were di&s;charged. That they are &s;atisfied the whole of the firing was from the &s;treet, and that all above was quiet, and no light in any of the front rooms of the <HI>Cu&s;tom hou&s;e.</HI> Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> added, that &s;oon after the firing he &s;aw two women &s;tanding at the chamber win|dow of the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,</HI> which is next to <HI>Royal-exchange-lane,</HI> with their hands under their aprons, in the po&s;ture of &s;pectators.</P>

<P>I lived with Mr. <HI>Bartholemew Green</HI> at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e</HI> on the 5th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, and when the noi&s;e was in the &s;treet, before the hou&s;e I went with (Hammond Green <HI>the pri&s;oner at the bar</HI>) <HI>Nancey Green</HI> and <HI>Mary Rogers</HI> up into that cham|ber of the hou&s;e, which is next to <HI>Royal exchange-lane</HI> and right over the Sentry box as it then &s;tood, and from the we&s;t window in that room &s;aw the party of &s;oldiers come down from the <HI>Main-guard</HI> to the Sentry; I tarried in this room till the firing was all over, and the &s;oldiers had re|turned from whence they came.
