<BIBL>PSAL. XXX. 11, 12.</BIBL>
<Q>Thou ha&s;t turned for me my mourning into danc|ing: Thou ha&s;t put off my &s;ackcloth, and girded me with gladne&s;s: To the end that my glory may &s;ing prai&s;e to thee, and not be &s;ilent; O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee forever.</Q>

<P>THIS is a p&s;alm or &s;ong of prai&s;e to God, compo&s;ed (as the title of the p&s;alm expre&s;|&s;es it) by David at the dedication of his hou&s;e: But the p&s;alm is taken up in the recounting the troubles and fears, difficulties and dangers he had been in; and the merciful inter|po&s;ition of divine providence for his deliverance out of them. And if we would have our hearts truly and thoro'ly affected with divine goodne&s;s, and our lips opened wide in devout prai&s;es to God, we mu&s;t look back to the troubles, the fears, the dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es we have been in, and from which God has delivered us: For the greatne&s;s of a mercy is according to the degree

of evil, mi&s;ery or calamity we are delivered from. &mdash; This was the way by which the p&s;almi&s;t's &s;oul was elevated in high devotion, his heart inlarged in gratitude, and his lips opened wide in prai&s;e to God. &mdash; It &s;hould &s;eem he had not only been under great difficulties and hazards, by his ene|mies, and by the hand of Saul, who from envy and jealou&s;y &s;ought his life; but that he had been brought low, and upon the borders of the grave by &s;ickne&s;s: But he cried unto the Lord, and he heard him, and kept him alive that he &s;hould not go down into the pit; and he prai&s;es God, that his anger endured for &s;o little a while, but for a moment, and then vi&s;ited with his favour which is life: <HI>weeping endured for a night; but joy came in the morning,</HI> 5th v. of the context. In the ver&s;es of our text he ob&s;erves, how won|derful the loving kindne&s;s of God had been to him in this re&s;pect; that he had &s;cattered the clouds, changed the dark and gloomy &s;cenes that had been before him, and had opened &s;uch new &s;cenes of joy and gladne&s;s as called for the mo&s;t enlarged gratitude and exalted prai&s;es. &mdash; <HI>Thou ha&s;t turned for me my mourning into dancing:</HI> He went mourning becau&s;e of the enemy and the oppre&s;&s;or, and was full of mourn|ing becau&s;e of his &s;ickne&s;s, and the threatnings of death: But now his mourning was turned into dancing, his &s;pirits were relieved of the heavy burthen that lay upon them: and he felt &s;uch a lightne&s;s and chearfulne&s;s within upon his
<PB N="9" REF="010230_0006_0F7DB59FA0161898">
deliverance, as inclined him to dancing and &s;uch like tokens of joy. <HI>Thou ha&s;t put off my &s;ack|cloth:</HI> In times of trouble, and when under the mighty hand of God, by &s;ome &s;ore judgment or threatning evil, they were wont in token of hu|mility to put on &s;ackcloth. Thus we find David and all the elders of I&s;rael, in the time of the Lord's anger, and when threatned with de&s;truc|tion, clothed with &s;ackcloth. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. 21. 16.</NOTE> But now God had put off his &s;ackcloth, had redre&s;&s;ed his grie|vances, and removed his grounds of fear. <HI>And girded me with gladne&s;s,</HI> That is, &s;o delivered him, &s;o relieved and revived his &s;pirit, as not only gave him peace and calmne&s;s of mind, but cau&s;ed great joy and gladne&s;s of heart to him. <HI>He girded</HI> him with gladne&s;s. He compa&s;&s;ed him about with gladne&s;s as with a girdle on every &s;ide. His &s;oul was filled with joy: and gladne&s;s appeared all about him, in his countenance, in his &s;peech, and in his whole behaviour. His troubles were removed, his burthens were taken off, his fears all vani&s;hed, and &s;o he was all joy and gladne&s;s. <HI>To the end that my glory may &s;ing prai&s;e to thee, and not be &s;ilent.</HI> That is, that his tongue might &s;peak and &s;ing the prai&s;es of God, and not &s;uffer &s;uch mercies to pa&s;s in &s;ilence and without a due acknowledgment of them. God delivered him from all his troubles, and from all that was his fear, and girded him with gladne&s;s, with this view that David might &s;ee

the power and goodne&s;s of God herein and ce|lebrate his prai&s;es. <HI>O Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee forever.</HI> He had &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the divine goodne&s;s, while he was thus girded with gladne&s;s, that he was not only for &s;inging and &s;peaking forth the prai&s;es of God for the pre&s;ent; but was for maintaining an abiding &s;en&s;e hereof upon his heart, &s;o as &s;hould be an inexhau&s;tible fund for everla&s;ting prai&s;e. The p&s;almi&s;t had &s;uch a &s;trong and lively &s;en&s;e of the &s;alvations and deliverances he had of late receiv|ed, that it &s;eemed to him that he &s;hould never forget the &s;ame: But that the remembrance hereof would be &s;o fre&s;h and &s;trong upon his mind, that he &s;hould feel an heart, and find a tongue to celebrate his prai&s;es forever, and ever.</P>
<P>The words thus largely opened afford us the following ob&s;ervations, which I hope will appear &s;ea&s;onable for our pre&s;ent meditation on the great and glorious occa&s;ion of our being this day together in the hou&s;e of God. &mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1 OBS. <HI>The great God has the ab&s;olute go|vernment of our affairs and circum&s;tances in the world, and opens the various &s;cenes of life to us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 OBS. <HI>It is the will of God, and what he has in view, when he changes the &s;cene in favour of his people, that they &s;hould not be &s;ilent, but &s;hould awake their glory to &s;peak and &s;ing his prai&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="11" REF="010230_0008_0F7DB5A13AF1D800">3 OBS. <HI>The true People of God de&s;ire to keep &s;uch a con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of the divine goodne&s;s as to be di&s;po&s;ed to prai&s;e his name forever.</HI></P>
<P N="4">1 OBS. <HI>The great God has the ab&s;olute go|vernment of our affairs and circum&s;tances in the world, and opens the various &s;cenes of life to us.</HI></P>
<P>This is what we are taught in the text, and which is acknowledged to his glory. David pa&s;&s;ed thro' very various &s;cenes of life, &s;ometimes he was mourning in &s;ackcloth: and then he was girded with gladne&s;s; both which he a&s;cribes to God. <HI>Thou</HI> hide&s;t thy face and I was troubled, 7th v. <HI>Thou</HI> ha&s;t al&s;o girded me with gladne&s;s, as in the text. And this is a glorious character which God a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf. <HI>I even I am He and there is no God with me; I kill, and I make alive, I wound, and I heal, neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> 32 39</NOTE>.

<P>Here let me &s;ay,</P>
<P>1&s;t. <HI>Whatever &s;orrowful, afflicted or threatning circum&s;tances we are at any time under, it is by the over-ruling providence of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shall there be any evil in the city,</HI> that is evil of affliction, <HI>and the Lord hath not done it</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Amos. 3 0.</NOTE> Some|times we are afflicted with bodily pains and &s;ick|ne&s;s. "He is cha&s;tned with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with &s;trong pain;

his &s;oul draweth near to the grave, and his life to the de&s;troyers" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job 23. 19 22.</NOTE>. And he is ready to &s;ay with Hezekiah when threatned with death by rea&s;on of the di&s;ea&s;e that was upon him, "I &s;aid in the cutting off my days I &s;hall go to the gates of the grave: I &s;hall not &s;ee the Lord in the land of the living: I &s;hall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world: He will cut me off with pining &s;ickne&s;s" <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah 38. 10, 11, 12.</NOTE>. Sometimes God reduces to &s;traits, poverty and famine: Some|times he deprives of the deare&s;t friends and rela|tives, and with them takes away the mo&s;t va|luable enjoyments and the &s;weete&s;t comforts of life, and gives them to complain with the p&s;al|mi&s;t, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">88 P&s;alm 18.</NOTE> "Lover and friend ha&s;t thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkne&s;s." Sometimes God hides the light of his counte|nance and they are troubled: and while they &s;uffer God's terrors they are even di&s;tracted. Some|times God &s;o over-rules or permits it to be, that a people's rights and privileges are invaded, and infringed, they are greatly oppre&s;&s;ed, and bro't into &s;lavery, or are under the fearful appre|hen&s;ion of it. How did God over-rule as to his people I&s;rael, that they &s;hould be &s;o many years in the land of Egypt, and in the hou&s;e of bon|dage! And how often did God afterwards, when &s;ettled in their own land, for their &s;inful de|partures from him, &s;ell them into the hands of their enemies, who cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed them!
<PB N="13" REF="010230_0010_0F7DB5A37220CB50">
Sometimes &s;uch a &s;evere hand was kept over them by tho&s;e who had them in &s;ubjection, that they were not allowed, &s;o much as a black&s;mith in all I&s;rael, le&s;t they &s;hould make &s;words and &s;pears, or any &s;uch weapons of defence, nor &s;o much as their hu&s;bandry tools <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam 13. 19.</NOTE>. Or if a peo|ple are not actually brought into &s;uch a bondage as this; yet any approaches towards, or threat|ning &s;uch infringements, may well cau&s;e grief and fear, &s;orrow and mourning, in token of which they were wont in ancient time to put on &s;ack|cloth. Thus Mordecai clothed him&s;elf with &s;ackcloth when that cruel edict of Aha&s;uerus came out again&s;t the Jews. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph 4 2, 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>And what a &s;orrowful, di&s;turbed and tumul|tuous &s;tate have all the Briti&s;h colonies of Ame|rica been in, when by a late parliamentary act, many of the privileges and liberties we had been in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, were cut &s;hort: and &s;hould the act have continued, we &s;hould not have been the free people that once we were, and &s;hould have been &s;ubject to &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ions as our fathers knew nothing of; and which neither we nor our children would have been able to bear.</P>
<P>2dly. <HI>Whenever the dark &s;cene is changed, and a more agreable one opens to us; it is God that does it for us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thou</HI> ha&s;t turned for me, my mourning into dancing. <HI>Thou</HI> ha&s;t put off my &s;ackcloth, and
<PB N="14" REF="010230_0011_0F7DB5A72BAECCE0">
girded me with gladne&s;s. That is, the great God changes the &s;cene, and gives us occa&s;ion for joy and gladne&s;s, and leads us to all the natural outward expre&s;&s;ions thereof.</P>
<P>Joy and &s;orrow are human pa&s;&s;ions, and one or the other is excited, according to the different &s;cenes God in his providence opens to us. Af|flictions and fears, of them&s;elves, beget &s;orrow and mourning: But the removal of real afflic|tions, &s;cattering our fears, and putting us into agreable circum&s;tances, begets a joy and gladne&s;s of heart. And this joy is excited more or le&s;s according or in proportion to the occa&s;ion. If it be a &s;ore calamity, and a very grievous burden we are delivered from, or if it be at &s;uch a cri|tical &s;ea&s;on when the danger is imminent and very threatning, and our fears run high; remov|ing &s;uch a calamity, and &s;cattering &s;uch fears as are gathering into di&s;tre&s;s and horror, creates &s;o much the greater joy and gladne&s;s: And &s;ome|times the trouble, or the fear is &s;o great and pre&s;&s;ing upon the mind, that the &s;udden removal of the &s;ame excites a joy and gladne&s;s beyond what we can expre&s;s: The &s;alvation may be &s;o great, and &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affect the mind, that men of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, are &s;ometimes thrown into rapturous extacies of joy.&mdash;There is a joy un|&s;peakable and full of glory.</P>
<P>And how is God now turning our mourning into dancing, putting off our &s;ackcloth and gird|ing us with gladne&s;s, by the joyful and well
<PB N="15" REF="010230_0012_0F7DB5A79B902318">
atte&s;ted news from that far, but mother country, which a&s;&s;ures us that the grievous and bitter ACT which put us into mourning, covered us with &s;ackcloth, and threw us all into confu&s;ion, is now REPEALED, <HI>totally repealed,</HI> made null and void, by the KING, LORDS, and COMMONS, in parliament a&s;&s;embled; &s;o as to be as if it had never been!</P>
<P>Oh! with what joy and gladne&s;s does it gird every true-born Engli&s;hman, every friend to liberty, and every true lover of his country, his mother country or the&s;e Briti&s;h colonies! what joy does now fill every brea&s;t, what gladne&s;s appears in every face and feature! and how does every one feel him&s;elf ready to bur&s;t forth in loud acclamations of joy!</P>
<P>But to exhilerate your &s;pirits, and excite your joys in a rational manner, and as becomes men of thought and judgment; who would always govern this very pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul by &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on; I &s;ay, in order to this, let us only con&s;ider the deplorable con|dition the nation and all the&s;e colonies mu&s;t have been in; if the government at home had e&s;tabli&s;hed the ACT, and proceeded to the inforcement of the &s;ame. If the&s;e had been the heavy tidings from home, that the parliament in&s;i&s;ted upon the rigorous execution of this <HI>act</HI> in all the American plantations, and that in order to it <HI>fleets</HI> were forming, <HI>forces</HI> rai&s;ing, and a grand armament preparing, to inforce obedience
<PB N="16" REF="010230_0013_0F7DB5A855F72F28">
to the ACT. I &s;ay if the&s;e had been the dole|ful tidings, Oh what grief, what fear, what con|&s;ternation, and confu&s;ion, &s;hould we have been put into! what anger and wrath, what re|&s;olution, what oppo&s;ition, what force, what vio|lence would this irritated people have gone into! what de&s;olation, what &s;laughter, and blood|&s;hed might have been expected! &mdash; And what an un&s;peakable hurt mu&s;t it have brought upon us, and upon our mother country! what an alienation of affection, what an interruption of mutual trade and commerce de&s;tructive to them as well as to us!</P>
<P>Moreover, How would they and we be ex|po&s;ed to our watchful and perfidious enemies, who would &s;uddenly and eagerly have catch'd at &s;uch a favourable opportunity to make repri&s;als upon us! &mdash;</P>
<P>Surely when we con&s;ider the very exten&s;ive as well as pernicious influence of this ACT, how deeply it would affect the nation as well as the colonies: and what contention and ill blood, yea, what violence, and &s;hedding of blood, what de&s;truction, and de&s;olation is happily prevented by the repeal of this act: Every one who loves his neighbour, who is concerned for the public peace and &s;afety, or that has any humanity, or bowels of compa&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be glad and rejoice at this merciful deliverance.</P>
<P>But then by the repeal of this oppre&s;&s;ive act, there is a po&s;itive good accruing, that may &s;erve
<PB N="17" REF="010230_0014_0F7DB5A8B5F17A90">
further to excite the joy, and increa&s;e the gladne&s;s of our hearts. This &s;erves to indear the KING (if po&s;&s;ible) yet more and more to us, and fill us with gratitude as well as loyalty to him, and to his royal hou&s;e, and will induce this people with all freedom to &s;acrifice their very lives and fortunes for the &s;upport and defence of his crown and dignity.</P>
<P>This al&s;o will maintain within us a ju&s;t ho|nor for, and dutiful regard to the Briti&s;h parlia|ment, as the &s;upreme legi&s;lative power of the nation, who heard our cau&s;e and redre&s;&s;ed our grievances.</P>
<P>This al&s;o will fix upon our hearts a mo&s;t grate|ful remembrance of tho&s;e wi&s;e and worthy pa|triots, who heartily e&s;pou&s;ed and &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly pleaded our cau&s;e, and &s;et things in &s;o clear and convincing a light, as to procure the repeal of &s;uch a di&s;agreable and de&s;tructive act. The&s;e great and good men, I &s;ay, who have exerted them&s;elves according to their &s;uperior abilities, and their inviolable attachment to ju&s;tice, truth and liberty in our behalf, will be remembred with honor, love and gratitude, and their memory ble&s;&s;ed we hope in future generations.</P>
<P>Moreover, by rea&s;on of this happy repeal, love and affection between the mother country and us, will return with its wonted ardor: Com|merce and trade will be carried on with the for|mer freedom, to the mutual advantage of both them and us. And we &s;hall be ready upon every
<PB N="18" REF="010230_0015_0F7DB5A9803D1C88">
occa&s;ion to &s;trengthen one another's hands for mutual &s;afety again&s;t the common enemy. And it gives the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of the growing greatne&s;s of the Briti&s;h empire. So that all who love the peace and pro&s;perity of the nation and all its dependencies; and are plea&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o &s;weet and plea&s;ant a thing as brethren dwelling together in unity and love; mu&s;t needs rejoice and be exceeding glad at this happy turn of times, as one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing and ex|ten&s;ive ble&s;&s;ings of an outward nature that we ever received.</P>
<P N="2">2 OBS. <HI>It is the will of God, and what he has in view, when he changes the &s;cene in favour of his people, that they &s;hould not be &s;ilent; but &s;hould awake their glory to &s;peak and &s;ing his prai&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the end that my glory may &s;ing prai&s;e to thee and not be &s;ilent.</HI> The great God will have us not only glad and joyful for any agreable and happy turn of affairs; but would have us al&s;o thankful. Many people are glad at the good news, and agreable change of affairs; but not thankful. They feel a plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation within; but no due &s;en&s;e of God, or religious acknow|ledgment of him. Whereas, this is what God expects and requires of us as men, and chri&s;tians. <HI>He girds me with gladne&s;s, to the end that my glory may &s;ing prai&s;e to him, and not be &s;ilent.</HI></P>
<P>By the p&s;almi&s;t's glory &s;ome under&s;tand his <HI>&s;oul,</HI> his rational and intellective powers, which
<PB N="19" REF="010230_0016_0F7DB5AA366A2148">
are indeed the glory of the man. But others un|der&s;tand it rather of his <HI>tongue,</HI> as <HI>&s;inging</HI> and <HI>not keeping &s;ilence</HI> mentioned in the text are appropriate to the tongue.</P>
<P>Let us take them together; rea&s;on, religion and &s;peech are the di&s;tingui&s;hing glory of man above every creature upon the foot&s;tool: and this glory taking it collectively, is not to be <HI>&s;ilent</HI> when we receive any &s;ignal favours from God; but to &s;hew forth his prai&s;e. <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> is to con|&s;ider the greatne&s;s of benefits received, with all the great and happy con&s;equences thereof. <HI>Re|ligion</HI> is to view the great God as the author, and giver of every good thing, and to ob&s;erve the great and the unde&s;erved goodne&s;s of God, in all the merciful and powerful interpo&s;itions of his providence; and the tongue is to &s;peak and &s;ing, and thereby to &s;hew forth the prai&s;es of God.</P>
<P>And who will &s;uffer his glory to be &s;ilent? who can refrain from meditating upon the great and wonderful things God has done for us, and from having his heart enlarged in thankfulne&s;s, and his mouth filled with prai&s;es? Surely rea&s;on, and religion, and the tongue, &s;hould all awake upon this great and joyful occa&s;ion, and not be &s;ilent.</P>

Moreover, our rea&s;on and judgment tells us, that it greatly affected Great-Britain it&s;elf in all its merchandize and manufacture: and in|deed that the whole Briti&s;h empire would have felt the ill-influence of it: and con&s;equently that the repeal of this act has relieved a multitude of people, and filled many thou&s;ands and millions with joy. For rea&s;on tells us this is the mo&s;t effectual method of preventing any grievous breach between the mother country, and the&s;e her colonies; and of pre&s;erving the peace, love, and happy harmony that have &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us; and of e&s;tabli&s;hing the power, wealth and pro&s;perity of all. And &s;o in &s;hort rea&s;on tells us, that this is one of the greate&s;t affairs, as to its influence and con&s;equences, that has been tran&s;acted in the nation for many ages. I believe it will be readily yielded, that there has &s;carcely been one thing of &s;o great importance to the Briti&s;h nation and colonies, &s;ince the <HI>happy revolution</HI> near four&s;core years ago, by King William of glorious memory; as the total repeal of the &s;tamp act.</P>
<P>Now let religion &s;peak, and let us &s;et our&s;elves to con&s;ider that divine power and influence by <PB N="21" REF="010230_0018_0F7DB5ABD4C9EE10">which this happy repeal has been effected.&mdash; Religion teaches us to view the hand of God in every thing. Religion teaches us that by the di|vine permi&s;&s;ion that oppre&s;&s;ive act was pa&s;s'd, by which God hid his face from us, te&s;tified his anger, and let us &s;ee what our &s;ins de&s;erved: and that it is of his unde&s;erved mercy, and thro' his all governing influence, that it is now repealed.</P>
<P>We may &s;ee, and we ought to ob&s;erve, &s;o far as we can, the natural means by which things are brought about; but we mu&s;t look above and beyond all human means and natural cau&s;es, to him <HI>who &s;itteth upon the circle of the earth,</HI> and who guides and governs in univer&s;al nature.</P>
<P>We may &s;ee, and we ought with gratitude to ob&s;erve, the wi&s;dom, the &s;agacity, the faithfulne&s;s, the indefatigablene&s;s of our generous friends in e&s;pou&s;ing and &s;olliciting our cau&s;e; and we may &s;ee the various arguments made u&s;e of, and the happy influence they had upon the King, and Parliament: But we mu&s;t look thro' all the&s;e to the great Governor of the world, who has the hearts of Kings, and of all men in his own hands, to change and turn them even as the rivers of water are turned: and &s;o religion &s;ees the hand of God in bringing about this repeal. And the good chri&s;tian will trace the foot-&s;teps of divine providence, &s;o far as is plain and obvious, and where it is beyond his penetration, he will con|&s;ider it as the work of the Lord, and regard it as the operation of his hands. Thus the chri&s;|tian
<PB N="22" REF="010230_0019_0F7DB5AC71AA08F8">
ob&s;erves the hand of God in that general commotion &s;tirred up in the nation when the act was fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, and the time of its taking place appointed. The providence of God is al&s;o to be &s;een in the univer&s;al unea&s;ine&s;s and clamour in all the colonies upon the fir&s;t tidings of it, all as one man ri&s;ing up in oppo&s;ition to it; &s;uch a union as was never before &s;een in all the colonies.</P>
<P>Moreover, God is to be &s;een in the change of the mini&s;try at &s;uch a critical and important &s;ea&s;on, and calling &s;uch eminently worthy patri|ots into the admini&s;tration, who &s;aw the dread|ful con&s;equences of inforcing the &s;tamp act, and were (as we under&s;tand) to a man for the repeal|ing it. And how vi&s;ible is the hand of God in rai&s;ing up &s;uch wi&s;e, able and faithful friends and advocates to &s;ollicit the repeal, and in filling their mouths with &s;uch clear, &s;trong and cogent argu|ments, to convince and per&s;wade of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a total repeal. Such as the Duke of Gra&s;ton, Marqui&s;s of Rockingham, Lord Dartmouth, Lord Camden, General Conway, the right Honorable William Dowde&s;well, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Sir William Meredith, Sir George Saville, Col. Barre, great and worthy patriots, whom God has rai&s;ed up and honoured as eminent in&s;truments of our deliverance. And how vi&s;ible is the hand of God, more e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to the great, the good, and the excellent Mr. Pitt, that grand <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of true virtue, and of Engli&s;h liberty,
<PB N="23" REF="010230_0020_0F7DB5AF5B5DCC60">
and whom God has once, and again rai&s;ed up to be the deliverer of the&s;e Briti&s;h colonies from captivity, and &s;lavery. I &s;ay, how remarkable was the kind hand of providence, that notwith|&s;tanding his chronical grievous malady of body, his &s;oul was in&s;pired with &s;uch a &s;acred ardor for his country's &s;afety; that he &s;urmounted all the difficulties of bodily pain and weakne&s;s; and appeared in that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly with all his flannels, and was enabled to utter him&s;elf with &s;uch clearne&s;s, clo&s;ene&s;s, plainne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s as carried conviction with it, and had its de&s;ired effect. Religion teaches us that the great God made &s;o great a man; formed and fitted him for &s;uch eminent &s;ervices, and u&s;ed and honored him as &s;uch a public Saviour to the Briti&s;h I&s;rael.</P>
<P>Moreover, Religion teaches us to &s;ee the great God &s;tanding in the congregation of the mighty, and judging among the Gods, pre&s;iding both in the hou&s;e of Commons, and in the hou&s;e of Lords, exciting their attention to the weighty rea&s;onings, and cau&s;ing them to feel &s;uch force and energy therein, as to change their mind, and be inclined to repeal what they &s;o lately enacted, being convinced this was the be&s;t, if not the only way to &s;ave the nation and its colonies from ruin. Now that majority of Parliament is to be highly honored, for their regard to the public good, that they no &s;ooner &s;aw the dangerous tendency of their late act, but they &s;peedily made it null and void. But as we would ho|nor
<PB N="24" REF="010230_0021_0F7DB5B00C7F2C48">
and re&s;pect every man, that has given his hand or voice for the public &s;afety; &s;o we would &s;ee the hand of God in all this remarkable event, from the beginning to the end. For religion will not allow us to attribute any thing to meer chance, but points out the hand of God in the mo&s;t ca&s;ual events. In what is there more chance than in votes, and lots? But what &s;ays the wi&s;e man? Prov. 16. 33. <HI>The lot is ca&s;t into the lap; but the whole determination is of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Well now, when rea&s;on and religion teach us the&s;e things, what is the tongue, that glory of men to do upon it? Why, be &s;ure, not to be <HI>&s;ilent,</HI> but to awake and talk of all his wondrous works, to &s;ing unto him, and to give prai&s;e.</P>
<P>And who will, or who can &s;uffer his glory to be &s;ilent, or refrain from &s;hewing forth the prai&s;es of God for this remarkable glorious in&s;tance of his goodne&s;s and mercy? O! how &s;hould our lips be opened in the mo&s;t exalted prai&s;es of God, and &s;ay he is our God and we will prai&s;e him, our father's God and we will prepare him an habitation, who has remembred us in our low e&s;tate, and in the critical hour gave the vote for us! What prai&s;es are due to almighty God from this people? that he gave us favour in the eyes of the King and of his Mini&s;try, and of his Lords and of his Commons, who have redre&s;&s;ed our grievances, and taken away the heavy yoke, that neither we nor our children would have been able to bear; whereby he has
<PB N="25" REF="010230_0022_0F7DB5B040AFB860">
relieved our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed minds, removed the gloom that hung upon every face, turned our mourning into dancing, put off our &s;ackcloth, and girded us with gladne&s;s. Oh! how then &s;hould we <HI>prai&s;e him with joyful lips, and &s;hew forth his prai&s;e from day to day? I will ble&s;s the Lord at all times; his prai&s;e &s;hall continually be in my mouth. My &s;oul &s;hall make her boa&s;t in the Lord, the humble &s;hall hear thereof, and &s;hall be glad. 0! magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together, and &s;ay, ble&s;s the Lord O our &s;ouls, and forget not all his benefits: Our &s;oul is e&s;caped as a bird out of the &s;nare of the fowler, the &s;nare is broken, and we are e&s;caped; our help is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth.</HI></P>
<P>But then we mu&s;t employ our tongue, our glory, not only to &s;peak but to &s;ing his prai&s;es. This is the language of gratitude and true devo|tion, <HI>O come let us &s;ing unto the Lord, let us make a joyful noi&s;e to the rock of our &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover we find in Ezra's day <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek 3. 11.</NOTE>, that the peo|ple in prai&s;ing the Lord &s;houted with a great &s;hout. <HI>Be glad then in the Lord, and rejoice ye righteous, and &s;hout for joy all ye that are upright in heart.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 OBS. <HI>The true people of God de&s;ire to keep up &s;uch a con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of divine goodne&s;s, as to be always di&s;po&s;ed to prai&s;e his name, and to give thanks to him forever.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="010230_0023_0F7DB5B0F6EDFB30"><HI>O Lord my God! I will give thanks unto thee forever.</HI> A truly grateful people will not content them&s;elvcs with a few thankful acknowledgments, or in attending the public wor&s;hip of God in a way of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving for an hour or two, or in bonfires and illuminations the evening after; but will labour to retain a grateful &s;en&s;e of divine favours all their life long, and to tran&s;mit the memory of God's great goodne&s;s to future generations. This will be the care of a godly and a grateful people, not to forget any of God's benefits; e&s;pecially &s;uch as are public, remarka|ble and very important; but to pre&s;erve the me|mory of them from generation to generation. <HI>We will not hide them from their children, &s;hew|ing to the generations to come the prai&s;es of the Lord, and his &s;trength and his wonderful works which he hath done; that the generations to come might know them, even the children which &s;hould be born, who &s;hould ari&s;e and declare them to their children, that they might &s;et their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 78. 4. 6. 7.</NOTE>.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the grateful and the gracious &s;oul will be for giving thanks to God forever in this world, as he will endeavour that one genera|tion &s;hall prai&s;e his works to another, and declare his mighty acts. But then the pious thankful &s;oul will prai&s;e this God forever and ever, in the other world, where all the wonders of divine
<PB N="27" REF="010230_0024_0F7DB5B1F1553A08">
goodne&s;s, and all his &s;ea&s;onable appearances for his church and people will &s;o open them&s;elves to the &s;aints, as to fill them with new matter of admiration and prai&s;e to all eternity.</P>
<P>How careful &s;hould we then be to perpe|tuate the memory of this late &s;ignal deliverance: and endeavour that God may be prai&s;ed forever and ever upon the account hereof: and when we are &s;leeping in the du&s;t of <HI>death</HI> which can|not prai&s;e God, and in the <HI>grave</HI> which cannot celebrate him; our children may ri&s;e up and prai&s;e him; and &s;o from generation to generation. And we wi&s;h to God there may be &s;uch la&s;ting, happy and ble&s;&s;ed effects of this repeal, as to our religious as well as civil intere&s;ts, as that we and our children may have occa&s;ion for rendering everla&s;ting prai&s;es to God in heaven. And if the repeal of this act &s;hould be the means of con|tinuing our religious as well as civil liberties, and of tran&s;mitting pure and undefiled religion to future ages: Oh! what a re&s;ource will it be of perpetual and everla&s;ting prai&s;es!</P>
<P>But then, as we are to keep up a grateful per|petual remembrance of God's great mercy to us, that &s;o we might prai&s;e him forever and ever; &s;o it becomes us to keep up a continued grateful re|membrance of tho&s;e worthy honorable patriots whom God has made eminent in&s;truments of good unto us. Ingratitude to friends and bene|factors is to be abhorred: and if we would not be ungrateful we may not be forgetful of &s;uch
<PB N="28" REF="010230_0025_0F7DB5B271AEEEE0">
who have been di&s;tingui&s;hingly kind, and good to us: But mu&s;t endeavour to perpetuate their names with honor: that they who ri&s;e up after them, and us, may call them ble&s;&s;ed. The me|mory of the ju&s;t is ble&s;&s;ed: and the righteous &s;hall be had in everla&s;ting remembrance. And it is highly ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, that they who have received &s;pecial benefits from the great and the good, &s;hould do their part that the memory of &s;uch may be ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>And as God has in this late dark day, and cri|tical juncture, rai&s;ed up powerful friends, and worthy benefactors to us, who by their wi&s;dom and zeal, their courage, con&s;tancy and clo&s;e ap|plication in our behalf, have procured this glo|rious deliverance for us; &s;urely we can do no le&s;s than call them ble&s;&s;ed, by wi&s;hing ble&s;&s;ings of every kind to them and theirs: and not only &s;o, but &s;hould endeavor that the memory of their good deeds may be handed down with ho|nor, not only in the annals of time and hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent age; but by &s;ome la&s;ting monu|ment or other.</P>
<P>And if it was in our power, how agreable would it be to have the glorious Mr. Pitt, and others of the fore-mentioned Worthies, who are avowed enemies of corruption, tyranny and op|pre&s;&s;ion, who are the fa&s;t friends of virtue, and powerful advocates for liberty; at the &s;ame time lovers of their King, their nation, and all the colonies: I &s;ay, how agreable would it be to
<PB N="29" REF="010230_0026_0F7DB5B5EB23CAF0">
have brazen or marble monuments erected, not only to perpetuate their memory; but to let the future ages &s;ee the truly grateful &s;en&s;e we had of their patriotic goodne&s;s in the time of it? I don't mean idolatrous images, to fall down and wor|&s;hip, which was the &s;uper&s;tition and folly of the ancient heathen, with re&s;pect to their heroes; but to pre&s;ent to future ages the re&s;emblances of &s;uch whom God formed, rai&s;ed up, and made &s;uch eminent in&s;truments of &s;aving the Briti&s;h Empire from impending ruin.</P>
<P>All that I have further to add here is, that in our prai&s;es and thank&s;givings to God for this pre&s;ent merciful deliverance, we join our humble &s;ervent prayers that this our tranquility may be lengthened out to future generations; and that; this people may never more be mole&s;ted in &s;uch a manner: But that we and ours may be conti|nued in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all our con&s;tituti|onal rights from age to age. And as the God of our fathers has &s;o wonderfully appeared for us at this time, we may confidently hope and tru&s;t he will for time to come, if we walk in his ways, and &s;erve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. And indeed con&s;idering, how fully this affair was debated in parliament, and the judgment of &s;ome eminently learned in the law, of both hou&s;es of parliament relative to con&s;titutional right, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears by the public prints, that Lord Camden in the hou&s;e of Lords. and Mr. Pitt in the hou&s;e of Commons, declared the Stamp Act to be uncon&s;titutional.</NOTE> and taking many other
<PB N="30" REF="010230_0027_0F7DB5B696571208">
things into con&s;ideration, we have no ground to fear any thing of this &s;ort, &s;o long as we approve our&s;elves loyal &s;ubjects of king George, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the Briti&s;h throne; and yield all due &s;ubjection to the Briti&s;h Parliament.</P>
<P>And, as the Jews of old, when they were de|livered from the cruel edict of the king for their de&s;truction, were filled with gladne&s;s and prai&s;e, and kept up an anniver&s;ary &s;olemnity in joyful remembrance of their deliverance, which was a <HI>day of gladne&s;s and fea&s;ting, a good day, and of &s;ending portions one to another</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> 19.</NOTE>. So now &s;ince this parliamentary edict which alarmed all our fears, and filled us with di&s;tre&s;s, is ab&s;olutely and entirely repealed; let every one be girded with gladne&s;s, and every tongue &s;ing prai&s;e to God.</P>
<P>And as this religious exerci&s;e will be followed with public rejoicings, and external tokens of joy; let me earne&s;tly exhort you all, both old and young, high and low, to conduct with all that decency &amp; due decorum, which becomes tho&s;e who have been in the hou&s;e of God this day, pouring out our devout religious acknowledgments before him; and attending upon the coun&s;els of his word. Let me intreat you, and in the name and fear of God, let me charge you in all your mirth to refrain from every thing that is <HI>profane;</HI> from every thing that is <HI>rude</HI> or <HI>un&s;eemly;</HI> from every thing that is <HI>intemperate</HI> and contrary to the rules of &s;obriety; and from every thing that

is <HI>mi&s;chievous</HI> or hurtful to the per&s;ons or pro|perties of others.</P>
<P>And let me further caution you again&s;t ma|naging your rejoicing in a way of triumph or in&s;ult upon any per&s;ons at home (for I know of none among our&s;elves) who have appeared zea|lous promoters of the act which is now aboli&s;h|ed. And that you avoid every thing that is ir|rirating or provoking to mens &s;pirits; or that tends to beget ill-will: For we know of no man, but who&s;e help and good-will we may &s;ometime or other have occa&s;ion for. Finally here let me advi&s;e you to break up your diver&s;ions in good &s;ea&s;on, and return every one quietly to his place of abode: And may every thing be conducted with &s;o good order, and with &s;uch innocency of behaviour as becomes the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, who joy in the Lord, and when they greatly rejoice, it is in the God of their &s;alvation. And if the&s;e external rejoicings flow from, or are accompanied with true gratitude to the God of heaven, who has appeared for our help, it will be a token of farther good.</P>
<P>Let me add one word more and have done; and that is, that we <HI>pay all due re&s;pect to the civil magi&s;trate,</HI> and a willing &s;ubjection to the government over us, whether &s;upreme or &s;ubor|dinate. Let us con&s;ider the true de&s;ign of go|vernment, which is the <HI>good of the community;</HI> and fixing this in our mind as a firm principle, it will &s;erve very much to direct, and regulate as

to all exertions of power, as well as to our obe|dience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion thereunto.
