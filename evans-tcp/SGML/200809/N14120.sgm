<HEAD>Divine Glory brought to View IN THE FINAL SALVATION OF ALL MANKIND.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH unconvinced by your arguments, I am plea&s;ed with the temper you di&s;cover; and am happy to find, you can unite the <HI>moderation</HI> of a <HI>fair di&s;putant</HI> with the <HI>candour</HI> of a <HI>chri&s;tian.</HI> Unlike &s;ome others, who have engaged in the controver&s;y, you attack <HI>opinions,</HI> and not their <HI>author,</HI> wi&s;ely con&s;idering others may differ from you in &s;entiment, without being <HI>in&s;idious</HI> foes to the inno|cence of mankind. However&mdash;though recommended by &s;o much candour and moderation, I am &s;till under the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;&s;enting from your reli|gious &s;y&s;tem. Nor can I calmly re&s;ign up a number of my &s;pecies to everla&s;ting mi&s;ery, notwith&s;tanding all you have &s;aid to prove it con&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;tice of God, and e&s;&s;ential to his glory. I have &s;uch a veneration for my creator, as to &s;uppo&s;e he needs no foil to &s;et off his perfections: Such an opinion of the &s;aints, as to imagine they could reli&s;h <HI>their</HI> felicity,
<PB N="4" REF="017870_0003_0FA37BD6020FE888">
without being &s;pectators of the mi&s;ery of the damned. I place &s;uch a value upon the merits and death of my redeemer, as to conclude all will be happy for whom he &s;uffered on the cro&s;s. And I pay &s;uch a regard to the po&s;itive declarations of &s;cripture, as to antici|pate the re&s;titution of all things;&mdash;when the ruins of the fall &s;hall be more than repaired, and <HI>the creature which now groans &s;hall groan no more.</HI></P>
<P>From the&s;e few hints it mu&s;t be evident to all, the Gods we re&s;pectively &s;erve are very unlike each other; and that our pro&s;pects beyond the grave do as widely differ. The God, to whom <HI>you</HI> pay your religious homage, needs the introduction of &s;in and mi&s;ery, in order to illu&s;trate his own character, and di&s;play his divine perfections. <HI>I</HI> bow my knee to a power <HI>intrin&s;ecally</HI> excellent, who can &s;hine without contra&s;t; who&s;e glory is e&s;&s;ential; who&s;e happine&s;s is immutable; and who would be the admiration of all his creatures, even were guilt and &s;uffering bani&s;hed the univer&s;e. <HI>You</HI> expect to look down from heaven upon numbers of wretched objects, confined in the pit of hell, and bla&s;pheming their creator forever. <HI>I</HI> hope to &s;ee the pri&s;on-doors opened; and to hear tho&s;e tongues, which are now profaning the name of God, chanting his prai&s;e. In one word, <HI>you</HI> imagine the divine glory will be advanced by immortalizing &s;in and mi&s;ery; <HI>I</HI> by exterminating both natural and moral evil, and introducing univer&s;al happine&s;s. Which of our &s;y&s;tems is be&s;t &s;upported, let rea&s;on and &s;crip|ture determine. Of this I am certain, we equally differ from the ORTHODOX &s;entiments of our country; and for this rea&s;on, <HI>I</HI> ought to be heard with the &s;ame candour which hath been exerci&s;ed towards <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="017870_0004_0FA37BD6C2FE4BE0">I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was not a little &s;urprized, when I ob&s;erved the reception your pamphlet met with, even from per&s;ons, who &s;tyle them&s;elves CALVINISTS: and pretend <HI>they</HI> are the only true followers of our venerable fathers. Could tho&s;e pious worthies (for &s;uch I <HI>really</HI> e&s;teem them) return to this world, they would reprobate <HI>your</HI> doctrines as earne&s;tly as they would <HI>mine. Univer&s;al redemption,</HI> which <HI>you</HI> allow, they never admitted as an article of their faith. But <HI>that,</HI> and many other points, advanced in your pam|phlet, they con&s;idered as fatal <HI>here&s;ies,</HI> &s;ubver&s;ive of the true go&s;pel, and de&s;tructive to the &s;ouls of men. What then mu&s;t I think of tho&s;e &s;erious per&s;ons, who condemn all innovations in religion, and profe&s;s the antient CALVINISTIC doctrines of this country? Either, that they (like many other hone&s;t men) have changed their opinions; or that they do not rightly apprehend their own religious &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>That controver&s;y may be &s;o conducted as to injure chri&s;tianity, I am very &s;en&s;ible: And no le&s;s &s;o, that it may be turned to the very great advantage of divine truth. This appears to be your opinion, and I readily acquie&s;ce in it. I agree with you, that "all doctrines &s;uppo&s;edly erroneous," ought to be tried by the &s;tand|ard of the holy &s;cripture. And that a "a di&s;po&s;ition to check every thing of the kind can be only attri|buted to a want of proper zeal, in the cau&s;e of truth." It is indeed hard to conceive, how a good man can &s;ee a doctrine borne down, which he e&s;teems the glory of the go&s;pel; or a &s;entiment propagated, which <HI>he</HI> imagines to be de&s;tructive of all virtue. Your zeal, therefore, in oppo&s;ing the doctrines of the reformation, as well as tho&s;e contained in a certain pamphlet, is an undoubted evidence of your chri&s;tian &s;incerity.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="017870_0005_0FA37BD789EB9CA0">But to return to the work which is the more imme|diate occa&s;ion of this letter. I &s;hall only take notice, at pre&s;ent, of the more exceptionable parts of your book. As &s;oon as any will undertake the publication of it, you &s;hall have a complete reply to the whole.</P>
<P>And I am the rather determined not to enlarge on this occa&s;ion, as I apprehend you have given up the matter in di&s;pute, in the very fir&s;t argument you bring again&s;t it. Your comment upon 1 Tim. ii. 3. and 1 Tim. iv. 10. leads to a conclu&s;ion of which you are not aware. I am ready to appeal to tho&s;e who are mo&s;t prejudiced in favour of your work, whether, upon your own principles, <HI>the final &s;alvation of all men</HI> does not nece&s;&s;arily follow. It were needle&s;s, therefore, to pur&s;ue you farther, till the error of this conclu&s;ion be detected.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ages, to which I referred, are as follows. "God our &s;aviour, who will have all men to be &s;aved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth." 1 Tim. ii. 3. "The living God, who is the &s;aviour of all men, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that believe." 1 Tim iv. 10. The former of the&s;e texts you explain after the u&s;ual manner; as intimating a de&s;ire that "all people, na|tions, and cla&s;&s;es of men" &s;hould become acquainted with the go&s;pel, and be made partakers of the &s;alva|tion there revealed. In your 9th page, you acknow|ledge there is a foundation laid for the <HI>univer&s;al</HI> be|&s;towment of life. Your words are,&mdash;"according to the expre&s;s word of God, it is plain, that mercy can|not be granted without an atonement; and where it cannot be granted, it &s;urely cannot be offered; and therefore, an offer of mercy, &s;o compleat and univer&s;al as has been mentioned, mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e an atonement
<PB N="7" REF="017870_0006_0FA37BD841C8C598">
equally compleat&punc; and &s;ufficient for the &s;alvation of the whole world." I agree with you, in oppo&s;ition to all the CALVINISTS that ever wrote upon the &s;ubject, that nothing could be a greater in&s;ult on the weakne&s;s and mi&s;ery of mankind, than to offer them all &s;alvation, unle&s;s there was a foundation laid for the be&s;towment of it. And I further acknowledge, "<HI>the obedience and death of Chri&s;t</HI>" are the moral ground of that general proclamation which is made in the go&s;pel, and the pardon which is offered unto all men."</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee what is the con&s;equence of &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion. According to your own principles, Je&s;us Chri&s;t has made a complete atonement for the &s;ins of the whole world. He hath "ta&s;ted death for every creature." At the expence of his precious blood, he hath "brought pardon, life and immortality to every man." So that, in con&s;equence of <HI>his</HI> merits and death, <HI>every individual</HI> of the human race <HI>may</HI> be happy in the future &s;tate; and God earne&s;tly de&s;ires it. This I take to be your real meaning, from your remarks on the fir&s;t and &s;econd pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture adduced by <HI>Mr. White.</HI> I am not &s;en&s;ible of any mi&s;repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>But the conclu&s;ion <HI>I</HI> draw from hence is very different from the opinion <HI>you</HI> have undertaken to defend. The doctrine of <HI>univer&s;al redemption</HI> nece&s;&s;arily infers <HI>univer&s;al &s;alvation.</HI> You allow the former, why would you di&s;pute the latter? If Chri&s;t died for all, &s;urely <HI>all</HI> will be <HI>finally happy.</HI> If the atonement be <HI>complete</HI> and <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> then <HI>univer&s;al happine&s;s</HI> mu&s;t en&s;ue. This the apo&s;tle has inconte&s;tably proved, in his epi&s;tle to the Romans, as we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter. Nor do I know of any but tho&s;e who are commonly
<PB N="8" REF="017870_0007_0FA37BD901E853B8">
&s;tyled <HI>Arminians,</HI> that call this in que&s;tion. The <HI>Orthodox</HI> univer&s;ally &s;uppo&s;e, that all will be &s;aved for whom the &s;on of God made an atonement. They would not &s;o undervalue the merits and death of Chri&s;t, as to a&s;&s;ert the contrary.</P>
<P>Allowing then, our divine redeemer died for <HI>all,</HI> and that God, their heavenly father, is <HI>de&s;irous</HI> of their everla&s;ting felicity, it mu&s;t follow, that all will, in due time, "come to the knowledge of the truth and be &s;aved." What &s;hould hinder the future accom|pli&s;hment of the divine will; or the final &s;ucce&s;s of Chri&s;t's mediatorial undertaking? <HI>Our</HI> wi&s;hes are often fru&s;trated: but God cannot be di&s;appointed. Ina&s;much as the &s;aviour of the world has atoned for the &s;ins of every creature, and God earne&s;tly de&s;ires the &s;alvation of <HI>all,</HI> it is inconceivable that any &s;hould peri&s;h everla&s;tingly. His infinite power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s forbid &s;uch a di&s;honourable &s;uppo&s;ition. If the&s;e attributes belong to God, he mu&s;t be able and willing to reduce <HI>all men</HI> to a &s;tate of moral &s;ubjection to his authority. And if &s;o, he certainly will not fail to do it, We may therefore, congratulate mankind up|on their future pro&s;pects; and a&s;&s;ure them of an en|trance into heaven, as &s;oon as they are qualified for its &s;ervices and entertainments.</P>
<P>To this, I know, it is commonly objected, that men are <HI>free agents,</HI> and con&s;equently may re&s;i&s;t all the mea&s;ures, God u&s;es for their reformation and hap|pine&s;s. But, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I do not &s;ee how this conclu&s;ion follows. Though <HI>free,</HI> yet &s;urely, infinite power, guided by infinite wi&s;dom, and excited by infi|nite goodne&s;s, may devi&s;e &s;uch a &s;cheme, as &s;hall bring <HI>all men</HI> into a &s;tate of moral &s;ubjection, without
<PB N="9" REF="017870_0008_0FA37BD9C1C06128">
breaking in upon their <HI>liberty</HI> It would be a gro&s;s reflexion upon the great Jehovah to &s;uppo&s;e him in|capable of doing this. He <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be able to treat all his creatures in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hall lead them to act a wi&s;e and rational part. And he <HI>will</HI> do it, if he &s;incerely de&s;ires their happine&s;s. To &s;ay therefore, that God "<HI>wills</HI> all men &s;hou'd come to the know|ledge of the truth, and be &s;aved," is virtually declaring that the whole human race will be finally happy. <HI>His de&s;iring</HI> they &s;hould be &s;aved, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> i&s;&s;ue in their everla&s;ting &s;alvation. And this falls in with the <HI>Cal|vinian</HI> doctrine re&s;pecting this point.
<Q>The <HI>will</HI> of God (&s;ay the divines of that denomination) is <HI>efficaci|ous</HI>&punc; and therefore, he cannot fall &s;hort of his purpo&s;e. If he <HI>willed</HI> all men to be &s;aved, he would &s;ave them <HI>effectually.</HI> It is annihilating his <HI>Omnipotence</HI> to &s;ay, he <HI>de&s;ires</HI> to &s;ave all men, but that he cannot.</Q></P>
<P>Upon your own principles then, I mu&s;t conclude again&s;t the &s;en&s;e you put upon the&s;e texts of &s;cripture. However, I will do you the ju&s;tice to own, your &s;entiments are, in &s;ome re&s;pects, more liberal than tho&s;e which have received the &s;tamp of <HI>Orthodoxy</HI> in this country. <HI>Calvini&s;tic</HI> writers will admit the &s;alvation of all for whom Chri&s;t died, but then, they pretend, he died only for the <HI>Elect.</HI> The <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Divines,</HI> who were under a &s;olemn oath, to maintain nothing, in point of doctrine, but what they believed, expre&s;s them&s;elves in the following words. "By the decree of God, &s;ome men and angels are prede&s;tinated unto everla&s;ting life, and others fore-ordained to everla&s;ting death. Tho&s;e of mankind, that are prede&s;tinated unto life. God, before the foundation of the world was laid, cho&s;e in Chri&s;t to everla&s;ting glory, out of his meer
<PB N="10" REF="017870_0009_0FA37BDA8013DDF0">
free grace and love, without any fore&s;ight of faith, or good works. And as he hath appointed he <HI>Elect</HI> unto glory, &s;o hath he fore-ordained the means thereunto&punc; Wherefore they who are Elected, being fallen in Adam are redeemed by Chri&s;t. Neither are any others redeemed by Chri&s;t &mdash;but the Elect only" This was their idea of things, and, our fathers entertained the &s;ame opinion. You have receded to the other extreme. You &s;uppo&s;e the atonement <HI>complete</HI> and <HI>univer&s;al.</HI> God according to <HI>you,</HI> wi&s;hes well <HI>to all</HI> his creatures, but &s;uffers his kind wi&s;hes to be de|feated. According to <HI>them,</HI> he neither de&s;ires the happine&s;s of a great part of mankind, nor made them with any &s;uch view. The God, you portray, is only deficient in wi&s;dom and power; <HI>theirs</HI> equally de&s;titute of goodne&s;s and &s;incerity.</P>
<P>But to return &mdash;The offer of &s;alvation being made to <HI>all,</HI> you argue the atonement, upon which that offer is grounded, mu&s;t be <HI>complete</HI> and <HI>univer&s;al.</HI> That is, as you explain your&s;elf, in virtue of the merits and death of Chri&s;t, <HI>all men</HI> are in a <HI>&s;alvable &s;tate.</HI> This is the <HI>truth,</HI> but not the whole <HI>truth.</HI> The death of our ble&s;&s;ed &s;aviour rendered the &s;alvation of mankind not only a po&s;&s;ible thing, but actually <HI>&s;ecured it to them in event.</HI> In a &s;en&s;e, we are all <HI>ju&s;tified, reconciled</HI> and <HI>&s;aved.</HI> We are born into the world heirs of immor|tality. And the part, a&s;&s;igned us, is to acquire &s;uch habits, and improve in &s;uch graces&punc; as &s;hall fit us for the joys of heaven, at the re&s;urrection day. Hence God is &s;tyled "the &s;aviour of all men, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that believe." In con&s;equence of the merits and &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t&punc; eternal life is &s;ecured to every individual; though <HI>believers</HI> only will be <HI>fir&s;t</HI> parta|kers of it. Others, who die in their &s;ins mu&s;t &s;uffer
<PB N="11" REF="017870_0010_0FA37BDB4169F040">
the con&s;equences of their di&s;obedience, and be reduced to a proper temper of mind, before they can be <HI>rati|onally</HI> and <HI>immortally happy.</HI> But &s;hall <HI>they</HI> peri&s;h forever? God forbid The &s;aviour of mankind (accor|ding to <HI>your</HI> confe&s;&s;ion) died for them, in common with others An atonement is already made for <HI>their</HI> &s;ins. And "through the obedience of one&punc; the free gift hath come upon <HI>them</HI> to ju&s;tification of life." The con&s;equence therefore, mu&s;t be, that &s;ooner or later, <HI>they</HI> al&s;o will reap the benefits of Chri&s;t's mediatorial undertaking.</P>
<P>This is &s;till further confirmed by the rea&s;oning of St. Paul in the 5th Chap of his epi&s;tle to the Romans, 8, 9, and 10th ver&s;es. "But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet &s;inners, Chri&s;t died for us. <HI>Much more</HI> then, being now ju&s;tified by his blood, we &s;hall be &s;aved from wrath through him. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his &s;on, <HI>much more</HI> being recon|ciled, we &s;hall be &s;aved by his life." This rea&s;oning, upon <HI>my</HI> principles, is &s;trong and conclu&s;ive; upon <HI>yours,</HI> I can &s;ee no force or pertinence in it. In&s;tead of ar|guing <HI>a fortiori,</HI> as the apo&s;tle intended, you would make him trifle, in a manner unworthy &s;o great a character. If I under&s;tand him right, the idea he would convey is this,&mdash;that in as much as God hath taken &s;uch an extraordinary &s;tep, as to deliver up his only begotten &s;on for the <HI>&s;inner</HI> and <HI>ungodly,</HI> we may rely on it, he will not fail to accompli&s;h his benevolent purpo&s;es, even their <HI>final re&s;toration to favour,</HI> and <HI>everla&s;ting &s;alvation.</HI> To illu&s;trate my meaning, let me refer you to the 6, 7 and 8th ver&s;es. Having mentioned the <HI>love of God,</HI> the apo&s;tle endeavours to
<PB N="12" REF="017870_0011_0FA37BDC01311590">
&s;et forth the <HI>exceeding greatne&s;s</HI> of it from this con&s;i|deration, that it was while men were <HI>without &s;trength, ungodly</HI> and <HI>&s;inners,</HI> that Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>died for them.</HI> But, if &s;uch was <HI>their</HI> moral &s;tate for whom he &s;uffered, MUCH MORE <HI>&s;hall they be &s;aved from wrath through him.</HI> In virtue of the atoning blood of Chri&s;t, the&s;e <HI>&s;inners</HI> and <HI>ungodly</HI> are in a <HI>ju&s;tified &s;tate.</HI> Or, as the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, thes;e <HI>enemies are reconciled to God</HI>&punc; They are all re&s;cued from that &s;tate of <HI>wrath</HI> and <HI>condemnation,</HI> to which they were reduced by the fall. God therefore, being now reconciled to the&s;e <HI>&s;inners, enemies,</HI> and <HI>ungodly,</HI> the apo&s;tle would teach us to argue, that they &s;hall <HI>eventually</HI> be &s;aved by the death of his &s;on. He would not have taken &s;uch mea&s;ures for the recovery of mankind, had he not intended to accompli&s;h their <HI>everla&s;ting &s;alvation</HI></P>
<P>The application is obvious: There is an atonement for &s;in <HI>complete</HI> and <HI>univer&s;al</HI>; and&punc; in con&s;equence of it, <HI>the free gift has come upon</HI> ALL MEN <HI>to ju&s;tifi|cation and life</HI> But whatever you under&s;tand by this <HI>ju&s;tification</HI>; whether you include more or le&s;s in it, mo&s;t certainly it follows from thence, that <HI>all men will be finally happy.</HI> For <HI>they all being ju&s;tified by his blood,</HI> &s;hall MUCH MORE <HI>be &s;aved from wrath through him.</HI> In other words, the <HI>univer&s;al redemption,</HI> which <HI>you</HI> allow, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> i&s;&s;ue in the <HI>univer&s;al &s;alvation,</HI> for which <HI>I</HI> contend.</P>
<P>I have now examined your fir&s;t argument, and cannot but think, you perceive the con&s;equences I have deduced from it. But ble&s;&s;ed be God, the <HI>&s;alvation of all men</HI> does not re&s;t merely upon the&s;e texts of &s;cripture. The &s;ame glorious truth is a&s;|&s;erted in the 8th chapter of this epi&s;tle to the
<PB N="13" REF="017870_0012_0FA37BDCBB9860D0">
Romans&punc; 19, 20 and 21&s;t ver&s;es. <HI>For the earne&s;t expectation of the creature waiteth for the manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God. For the creature was made &s;ubject to vanity, not willingly, but by rea&s;on of him who hath &s;ub|jected the &s;ame in hope: Becau&s;e the</HI> CREATURE IT|SELF <HI>al&s;o &s;hall be</HI> DELIVERED FROM THE BON|DAGE OF CORRUPTION, INTO THE GLORIOUS LIBERTY OF THE CHILDREN OF GOD." By the <HI>creature,</HI> we are to under&s;tand the <HI>whole rational creation.</HI> So the word is u&s;ed in other places, as you may &s;atisfy your&s;elf by recurring to the <HI>Greek Original.</HI> And it is mo&s;t po&s;itively declared, that the &s;ame moral intelligent creation, that is now &s;ubject to vanity &s;hall hereafter be <HI>delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</HI> But <HI>all men,</HI> without exception, are &s;ubjected to vanity, therefore they &s;hall <HI>all,</HI> with|out exception, be delivered from it; and in&s;tated in that freedom, which is the glory of <HI>rational be|ings,</HI> and con&s;titutes their <HI>&s;upreme felicity.</HI></P>
<P>And in order to qualify them for this happy &s;tate, they will be <HI>all</HI> previou&s;ly &s;ubjected to the govern|ing authority of God. They will be delivered from their &s;ins; their moral di&s;order will be recti|fied; their vicious habits &s;ubdued.

"Behold the lamb of God, which taketh away the <HI>&s;ins of the world!</HI>" And the name <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was conferred on him, becau&s;e he &s;hould <HI>even|tually</HI> "&s;ave his people from their <HI>&s;ins.</HI>"</P>

And this, not only as a reward for his humiliation, but the better to enable him to pro&s;ecute the benevolent de&s;ign of his mi&s;|&s;ion even the <HI>Salvation of All.</HI> "God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name." No created power, either in heaven or earth, is able to <HI>control his authority.</HI> The con&s;equence is, "every knee will finally bow, and every tongue confe&s;s him Lord, to the glory of the father." God hath &s;olemnly &s;worn,&mdash;&s;uch a &s;tate of moral &s;ub|jection to his authority &s;hall univer&s;ally take place; nor can we doubt of it, without giving him the lie.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, Sir, (and numberle&s;s others, which I would produce, were it not for anticipating an inge|nious work, where the &s;ubject is exhau&s;ted) I mu&s;t &s;till di&s;&s;ent from you, re&s;pecting the final i&s;&s;ue of our Lord's benevolent undertaking. The repeted declarations of &s;cripture, as well as my own natural apprehen&s;ions of the Deity, convince me, <HI>all men will be finally happy</HI>&punc; This, I am &s;en&s;ible, is a very unpopular doc|trine. It meets with great oppo&s;ition in the world; and is very prejudicial to the <HI>temporal intere&s;t</HI> of tho&s;e who have the courage to advance it. However, the que&s;tion is&mdash;<HI>not what is popular? but what is truth?</HI> A real friend to revelation will always contend for the <HI>latter</HI>; happy, if his zeal is imputed to a right prin|ciple, and undi&s;couraged, though it expo&s;es him to univer&s;al reproach.</P>
<P>Many &s;erious per&s;ons are much concerned about the tendency of this doctrine. And you, Sir, &s;eem to &s;hare in the general alarm. But why &s;uch unea&s;y
<PB N="15" REF="017870_0014_0FA37BDEC6DE4918">
apprehen&s;ions? You give us to under&s;tand, that the great "ruler of heaven and earth permitted &s;in to come into exi&s;tence, in order to give di&s;tinction to holine&s;s." And you plainly intimate, that there will be no more &s;in in the world, than is nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e the lu&s;tre of its oppo&s;ite; and by the force of contra&s;t, di&s;play its beauty in a more &s;triking light. Why then are you alarmed at the doctrine of <HI>univer&s;al &s;alvation?</HI> Suppo&s;e unthinking minds <HI>&s;hould</HI> take the advantage of it? Suppo&s;e it <HI>&s;hould</HI> be &s;o perverted as to increa&s;e the number of bad men? Upon <HI>your</HI> principles, this &s;hould be a matter of joy. The more wicked|ne&s;s there is in the world the more beautiful will holi|ne&s;s appear. The more will free grace be enhanced; and the more will God be known and admired by his rational creation. You ought therefore, to de|precate a general reformation of manners. And if you ever prayed, it &s;hould be for a &s;pirit of delu&s;ion, that &s;till greater numbers might &s;in again&s;t God, and be damned everla&s;tingly for <HI>his</HI> glory, and to give di&s;tinction to holine&s;s. I am &s;urprized, you &s;hould be &s;o apprehen&s;ive of prevailing impiety, when you are &s;o well convinced of the &s;olid advantages of it.</P>
<P>But to return;&mdash;did you and other good minds really deprecate <HI>moral evil</HI>; did you wi&s;h to &s;ee it utterly exterminated, you would find nothing in the book you oppo&s;e, to fill you with unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions. It is for want of due examination, you pronounce &s;o unfavourably upon it. I defy the art of man to prove that doctrine an encouragement to licenciou&s;ne&s;s, which in&s;i&s;ts, that <HI>a man will be mi&s;erable, while he is wicked</HI>; and that <HI>he mu&s;t be virtuous in order to be happy.</HI> If &s;inners are puni&s;hed, in proportion to their guilt; and
<PB N="16" REF="017870_0015_0FA37BDF061C9728">
are excluded heaven, 'till they are humbled and re|formed, all the ends of the vindicatory part of God's law are fully an&s;wered.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;y&s;tem of error,</HI> which to me appears mo&s;t fatal to the morals of mankind, is that which makes God the efficient cau&s;e of all evil, and refers all our wicked actions to his divine agency. Had the pam|phlet, you oppo&s;e, contained any thing of this kind, I &s;hould readily have born te&s;timony again&s;t it. I am not ignorant, that men would take the advantage of &s;uch doctrines, and impiou&s;ly charge all their vices upon the ble&s;&s;ed God. Could they be once per&s;uaded, in their own minds, that (contrary to all experience) they had no will of their own; that they were only in&s;truments in the hand of God, while <HI>he</HI> was the efficient cau&s;e of all the mi&s;chief perpetrated in the world, they would be very unconcerned about their behaviour. They could not but perceive, on this &s;up|po&s;ition, that virtue and vice were mere empty names.</P>
<P>And yet, the&s;e are the doctrines, which have been proclaimed from the de&s;k; and offered to the world as truths of the go&s;pel. Le&s;t men &s;hould reflect too &s;everely upon them&s;elves, for their wicked conduct, they are told, for their comfort, God is the efficient cau&s;e of all their actions: That &s;in is infinitely con|ducive to his glory: And that we ought to be thankful for all the immoralities which have di&s;graced mankind! The&s;e are the mon&s;trous errors, which appear to me mo&s;t pernicious to the morals of &s;ociety. It is the propagation of the&s;e &s;entiments I mo&s;t dread, at this time of general licenciou&s;ne&s;s. And would to heaven I may be mi&s;taken, in my &s;u&s;picions that <HI>you,</HI> Sir, have been betrayed into the &s;ame error. From &s;ome
<PB N="17" REF="017870_0016_0FA37BDFC1CFB308">
expre&s;&s;ions, in the latter part of your book, I was not without my fears; though I &s;hould be happy to find they were wholly without foundation.</P>
<P>No man, who is not &s;trangely infatuated, will deny that <HI>modern fatali&s;m</HI> is infinitely more prejudicial to the morals of &s;ociety than the doctrine of a <HI>final re&s;ti|tution</HI> Our fathers, who were e&s;teemed the &s;tandard of ORTHODOXY, would have reprobated the former, though they might not have fallen in with the latter. The <HI>Fatali&s;t</HI> would have fared as ill with them, as the advocate for <HI>Univer&s;al Salvation.</HI> It is to be hoped, therefore, tho&s;e good people, who profe&s;s the religious opinions of our fathers, will not di&s;charge all their indignation upon the <HI>Univer&s;ali&s;t,</HI> while there are other doctrines, as unlike their own, propagated in the world. While they &s;hudder at the con&s;equences of what they improperly &s;tyle the <HI>new doctrine,</HI> let them tremble at the others. And while they condemn the <HI>Univer&s;ali&s;t,</HI> let them not pa&s;s by the <HI>Fatali&s;t,</HI> unnoticed and unreproved. Otherwi&s;e, they will give ju&s;t rea|&s;on to &s;u&s;pect their <HI>Zeal is without knowledge,</HI> and that they are actuated by &s;ome other principle, than a real concern for the truth. I mention this, becau&s;e the <HI>here&s;y,</HI> of which I have been &s;peaking, is pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence, by tho&s;e very per&s;ons, who profe&s;s the &s;ame religious opinions with our fathers.</P>
<P>But not to enlarge &mdash; The work, which I have more than once mentioned, will an&s;wer all the objections hitherto urged again&s;t the <HI>final &s;alvation of all men.</HI> Referring you therefore, to <HI>that,</HI> for further &s;atisfaction, let me take leave with the following &s;erious enquiry.
<PB N="18" REF="017870_0017_0FA37BE086B53960">
Do you not really think the <HI>glory of God,</HI> will be more advanced by the <HI>final happine&s;s of the whole human kind,</HI> than the everla&s;ting perdition of any? If, by his wi&s;e and benevolent mea&s;ures, he reduces <HI>all men</HI> to a willing &s;ubjection to his authority, and then fixes them in a &s;tate of unending felicity, will it not redound more to his honour, than if he left them in utter ruin? Is it not undervaluing the blood of Chri&s;t, to &s;uppo&s;e he died for any who will peri&s;h everla&s;tingly? And can we reconcile the providential admini&s;trations of God, but upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of <HI>final, univer&s;al happine&s;s?</HI> If we can not, let us not &s;tart at a conclu|&s;ion, which reflects &s;o much honour upon God, and places &s;uch a ju&s;t value upon the &s;acrifice of his &s;on. We can not think too highly of the former, nor ought we to &s;et bounds to the happy con&s;equences of the latter.</P>
<P>And as for tho&s;e &s;erious per&s;ons, who expre&s;s them|&s;elves with &s;o much bitterne&s;s upon the &s;ubject of <HI>Univer|&s;al Salvation,</HI> let me a&s;k them, whether they imagine its advocates have any worldly ends in view, in publi&s;h|ing their &s;entiments to mankind? Will it promote their temporal intere&s;t? Will it procure them friends? Will it advance their reputation? If it will do neither, they ought, at lea&s;t, to be treated as <HI>well meaning enthu|&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> and not as &s;ecret enemies to the good order of &s;ociety. Such candour, on the &s;ide of their opponents, would convince the world, <HI>they</HI> were hone&s;t in their objections; that they were really afraid of error, and not of expo&s;ing their judgment, by reviewing their early notions, and receding from the principles of their education.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="017870_0018_0FA37BE14318E860">I will only add, if I am in an error, I pray God to convince me of it. I hope, I am open to convic|tion. My temporal intere&s;t, my u&s;efulne&s;s, my repu|tation in the world, would be greatly advanced, by my returning to the common opinions of my fellow-chri&s;tians. To each of the&s;e I do a material injury, while I retain my pre&s;ent religious &s;entiments. You will therefore, a&s;cribe my plainne&s;s to a right prin|ciple&mdash;even <HI>a firm per&s;ua&s;ion, in my own mind, that the go&s;pel contains nothing unfit for the world to know; that modern prudence is the fal&s;e wi&s;dom condemned by our ble&s;&s;ed &s;aviour; and that the vulgar arts of conceal|ment are equally unworthy the &s;cholar, the divine, and the Chri&s;tian!</HI></P>
