<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> Editor is happy that after having taken great pains, and having &s;pared neither trouble nor ex|pen&s;e, he is able to pre&s;ent his friends and the public with the large&s;t and (he believes) the be&s;t collection of &s;ongs ever pub|li&s;hed in this country.</P>
<P>As it frequently happens that collections of this kind abound with ribaldry and indecency, the greate&s;t attention has been paid, that nothing of that tendency &s;hould he admitted into this &s;election, &s;o that the cautious parent, friend or preceptor may pre&s;ent this book as an agreeable companion to the &s;ocial mind.</P>
<P>In the Ma&s;onic collection he has been able by the help of a variety of books and the kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance of friends, to form what he hopes will prove an agreeable companion to his brethren in ge|neral; he a&s;&s;ures them that he has taken great care in &s;elec|ting, that none but &s;uch as are genuine &s;hould be admitted. He has taken the liberty of adding at the end of the volume, the celebrated and much admired tale of <HI>"Mon&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur Ton&s;on,"</HI> which he doubts not will be acceptable, and which he conceives not improper to in&s;ert in a collection of this kind.</P>

<L>The name of <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI> rai&s;ed the &s;torm &s;o high,</L>
<L>He deem'd it then the &s;afe&s;t plan to fly,</L>
<L>With&mdash;"well, I'll call when you're in gentler mood."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In &s;hort our hero, with the &s;ame intent,</L>
<L>Full many a night to plague the Frenchman went;</L>
<L>So fond of mi&s;chief was this wicked wit:</L>
<L>They threw out water, for the watch they call,</L>
<L>But King expecting, &s;till e&s;capes them all;</L>
<L>Mon&s;ieur at la&s;t was forc'd his hou&s;e to quit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It happen'd that our wag about this time,</L>
<L>On &s;ome fair pro&s;pect &s;ought the Ea&s;tern clime;</L>
<L>Six ling'ring years were there his tedious lot,</L>
<L>At length content, amid his rip'ning &s;tore,</L>
<L>He treads again on Britain's happy &s;hore,</L>
<L>And his long ab&s;ence is at once forgot.</L>

<PB N="70" REF="033983_0283_0FF9E94DA5F4A4F0">
<L>To London, with impatient hope he flies,</L>
<L>And the &s;ame night, as former freaks ari&s;e,</L>
<L>He fain mu&s;t &s;troll the well-known haunt to trace,</L>
<L>"Ah! here's the &s;cene of frequent mirth," he &s;aid:</L>
<L>"My poor old Frenchman, I &s;uppo&s;e is dead;</L>
<L>"Egad! I'll knock, and &s;ee who holds his place."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With rapid &s;trokes he makes the man&s;ion roar</L>
<L>And while he eager eyes the op'ning door,</L>
<L>Lo! who obeys the knocker's ratling peel?</L>
<L>Why e'en our little Frenchman, &s;trange to &s;ay,</L>
<L>He took his old abode that very day:</L>
<L>Capricious turn of &s;portive fortune's wheel!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Without one thought of the relentle&s;s foe,</L>
<L>Who, fiend like, haunted him &s;o long ago;</L>
<L>Ju&s;t in his former trim he now appears;</L>
<L>The wai&s;tcoat and the night-cap &s;eem'd the &s;ame,</L>
<L>With <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;h-light as before he creeping came,</L>
<L>And King's dete&s;ted voice a&s;toni&s;h'd hears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As if &s;ome hideous &s;pectre &s;truck his &s;ight,</L>
<L>His &s;en&s;es &s;eem'd bewilder'd with affright;</L>
<L>His face, indeed, be&s;poke a heart full &s;ore,</L>
<L>Then &s;tarting, he exclaim'd, in rueful &s;train,</L>
<L>"Begar! here's Mon&s;. <HI>Ton&s;on</HI> come again."</L>
<L>Away he ran&mdash;<HI>and ne'er was heard of more.</HI></L>
