<P>&mdash;But the natural man receiveth not the things of the &s;pirit of God, for they are fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him: neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</P>
<P>THESE are words, which, by many, have not been pro|perly under&s;tood; but have been gro&s;&s;ly mi&s;interpreted and mi&s;applied. But, the true and proper &s;en&s;e and meaning of them may, from the general tenor of St. Paul's rea&s;oning in the chapter of the text, be clearly a&s;certained.</P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing on them, I &s;hall, in the FIRST place, explain them. And then, SECONDLY, draw &s;ome inference from them. IN the fir&s;t place, I &s;hall explain the words of the text.</P>
<P>BY the natural man receiving not the things of the &s;pirit of God, we are to under&s;tand, that men in a &s;tate of nature, who will be per&s;uaded to believe nothing but what is demon&s;trated by arguments of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy, will not receive the things revealed by the &s;pirit of God, the truth of which de|pends on a different kind of evidence, the demon&s;tration of miracles, &amp;c. Such men as the&s;e, who depend wholly on the di&s;coveries of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophical demon&s;tration, will not receive or believe the things revealed by the &s;pirit of God. To them &s;uch revelations appear to be fooli&s;hne&s;s, or things not founded in truth. The&s;e are the per&s;ons whom the Apo&s;tle calls natural men, men in a &s;tate of nature. Such were the Greeks, to whom the go&s;pel appeared to be fooli&s;h|ne&s;s, becau&s;e it appeared not, in the wi&s;dom of man, embell|i&s;hed with human learning, and founded on deductions of
<PB N="4" REF="026261_0003_0FD00B94A91D9E98">
rea&s;on. They would not receive doctrines delivered in plain &s;imple language, and re&s;ting on the te&s;timony of miracles. Such men, depending on nature or the mere light of nature or rea&s;on as being fully &s;ufficient, would not receive &s;upernatural aid. Hence, they are called natural men who would not receive the things of the &s;pirit of God. And, that St. Paul meant by natural men or the natural man, &s;uch per&s;ons as the&s;e, is evi|dent from the general tenor of his di&s;cour&s;e in the chapter of which our text is a part. Says he, "And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of &s;peech or of wi&s;|dom declaring unto you the te&s;timony of God; for, I deter|mined not to know any thing but Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him cruci|fied: and my &s;peech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wi&s;dom, but in demon&s;tration and with pow|er, that, your faith &s;hould not &s;tand in the wi&s;dom of men, but in the power of God. Now, we have not received the &s;pirit of the world, but the &s;pirit of God, that we might know the things which are freely given us of God; which things, al&s;o, we &s;peak; not in the words which man's wi&s;dom teacheth, but which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth, comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual." And then are introduced the words of the text&mdash;"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the &s;pirit of God," &amp;c. Here, it plainly appears, that the Apo&s;tle is &s;peaking of revelation being rejected of men, who depended wholly on their worldly wi&s;dom and deductions of rea&s;on as the only valuable knowledge. Such men, whom he denominates natural men, receive not the things of the &s;pirit of God or the truths revealed by the &s;pirit of God, and re&s;t|ing on the evidence of miracles. A revelation, to &s;uch men, appeared to be fooli&s;hne&s;s, becau&s;e of its &s;implicity, and be|cau&s;e it depended on a kind of evidence they did not admit as rational.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle goes on&mdash;"Neither can he," the natural man, "know them,"; that is, the things of the &s;pirit of God, "becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned." His meaning is, that men who depend wholly on human rea&s;on and the light of nature, and who will not admit of revelation, cannot know the things of God, the things which God reveals. Natural rea&s;on can in no way di&s;cover them, becau&s;e they are things originally known only to the &s;pirit of God, and are beyond the reach of natural light. But, he that would know them,
<PB N="5" REF="026261_0004_0FD00B98B5CBC250">
mu&s;t receive them from the &s;pirit of God by revelation. For, "who," &s;ays the apo&s;tle, "hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may in&s;truct him."&mdash;That is, who is he that hath known the will of God in matters of mere revelation, 'till God hath revealed his will or made it known. The natural man, therefore, who admits of nothing but what he can find out by the light of mere rea&s;on, does not know the things of God, which can be known only by revelation.&mdash;Nor will he receive them, becau&s;e they depend on a kind of evidence which he will not admit as &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h any truth. This is the &s;en&s;e of our text; and the proper &s;en&s;e of it, when examined by the &s;en&s;e of the whole chapter of which the text is a part. But, by the natural man here, is not meant all unregenerate or carnal men; but tho&s;e men only are meant, who, through their attachment to wordly wi&s;dom, will not attend to and admit a revelation. But, if by the natural man, was intended all unregenerated men, then, it would fol|low, that all &s;uch, till they were converted, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be entirely ignorant of the things of the &s;pirit of God, or the things revealed by him. But, then, the go&s;pel would be no benefit to &s;uch; for to them it would be fooli&s;hne&s;s. They could not have any knowledge of it, or receive it. And hence, it would be impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be &s;anctified or &s;a|ved by it: For, how could they be &s;anctified by that of which they had no knowledge, and which they could not receive? But I would be a little particular on my remarks here.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome per&s;ons, that unregenerate men cannot have any proper under&s;tanding or knowledge of the holy &s;criptures, or &s;uch as may make them wi&s;e unto &s;al|vation: but that, before they can have &s;uch an under&s;tanding of the &s;criptures, they mu&s;t have &s;ome new faculty conveyed to the mind which they had not before, to enable them to know and properly under&s;tand and receive things of a divine and &s;piritual nature. But this, no doubt, is a mi&s;take; for, even to regenerated and &s;anctified per&s;ons, the &s;pirit of God conveys no new faculty. The man has before and after re|generation all the &s;ame mental faculties. He has all the &s;ame powers of perception, rea&s;oning, judging, recollecting, &amp;c. both before and after regeneration. Before regeneration, he can obtain as good a &s;peculative knowledge of the holy &s;crip|tures, and rea&s;on on them as pertinently, as afterwards. He
<PB N="6" REF="026261_0005_0FD00B9E93F45E30">
can have as clear a perception of religious truth, and di&s;cour&s;e on it as intelligibly before his conver&s;ion as after. And he can obtain, by the ordinary aids of God's &s;pirit, &s;ufficient knowledge of the way of &s;alvation and the importance of it, to be &s;tired up to conviction, and to cry, What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved. Knowledge mu&s;t be before conviction and con|ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>A MAN before he is brought to Chri&s;t, mu&s;t have &s;ome knowledge of him, or he can never come to or receive him. The go&s;pel is able to make per&s;ons wi&s;e to &s;alvation. But it is impo&s;&s;ible for the go&s;pel to make men wi&s;e, when they can have no knowledge of it. If unregenerate men cannot obtain by the ordinary aids of God's &s;pirit &s;ufficient knowledge and un|der&s;tanding of the holy &s;criptures to obtain &s;alvation, it mu&s;t be either owing to their wanting &s;ome new faculty of perception or under&s;tanding, or to their &s;tanding in need of &s;ome extraordi|nary efflatus or revelation from the &s;pirit of God. But it may be evident to common &s;en&s;e, that regenerated men have no faculty of di&s;cerning truths, which the unregenerate have not; for both the regenerate and unregenerate have, often, the &s;ame perception and under&s;tanding of the &s;ame truths: and therefore, the unregenerate have no need of any new faculty to under&s;tand the &s;criptures. Nor have they need of any ex|traordinary efflatus or revelation from God, to enable them to obtain right perceptions and under&s;tanding of the &s;criptures: for we are now compleat in Chri&s;t: nor is any new revelation to be expected. But if we need a new revelation to under|&s;tand the fir&s;t, we mu&s;t have a third to enable us to under&s;tand the &s;econd. And then we mu&s;t have revelation upon reve|lation without end, in order to under&s;tand any thing; which would prove that they were all &s;o ob&s;cure, that we could under|&s;tand nothing; and the very end of revelation would be defeated.</P>
<P>IT is a very dangerous thing for men to believe that extra|ordinary light or communications of truth from the &s;pirit of God are nece&s;&s;ary in order to their under&s;tanding the &s;crip|tures: for then they will make that extraordinary light their guide, becau&s;e revelation is &s;uppo&s;ed to be in&s;ufficient in the &s;criptures. And then they be&s;ure mu&s;t try the &s;criptures by the &s;pirit&mdash;but will not try the &s;pirits by the &s;criptures to know whether they are of God. But then the &s;criptures will not be their guide in faith; but they will be led by their own
<PB N="7" REF="026261_0006_0FD00BA0450F6518">
&s;ancies, and will not be able to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;pirit of God from a &s;pirit of delu&s;ion. Thus they will be deprived en|tirely of the benefit of a written and &s;tanding revelation. The go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is a plain intelligible revelation of the will and coun&s;els of God. It is adapted to the capacities of mankind in general; but it is not a &s;y&s;tem of refined and ob|&s;cure philo&s;ophy, requiring great abilities to under&s;tand it, &s;o far as is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation.&mdash;But, &s;o far is it from being ob&s;cure in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of it, that it is plain and &s;imple in its meaning, &s;o that he that runs may read: And it is addre&s;&s;ed to mankind at large&mdash;to the wi&s;e and &s;imple&mdash;to men &s;anctified, and to &s;uch as are not: and it is the power of God to &s;alvation through faith; and was de&s;igned to enlighten and reform &s;inners, as well as to carry the ju&s;t on to perfec|tion. But it would be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that God would ad|dre&s;s &s;inners by a revelation which they could not (in the great e&s;&s;entials) under&s;tand; or, that a revelation was de&s;ign|ed to reform the vicious, without giving them any light or information. The Apo&s;tle Paul ob&s;erves, that they, the Apo&s;tles, u&s;ed in their preaching great plainne&s;s of &s;peech, commending them&s;elves to every man's con&s;cience. But this could not be done, unle&s;s men could under&s;tand the truths they taught. That which is plain, mu&s;t be under&s;tood.&mdash; And that which takes hold of a man's con&s;cience mu&s;t con|vey light and conviction. And, it is fact, that &s;ome have been in &s;ome good mea&s;ure enlightened by, and have ta&s;ted the good word of God, and have felt the powers of the world to come, but yet have fallen away. So that we find, that men who are not real Chri&s;tians, may under&s;tand the holy &s;crip|tures, &s;o as to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure convicted and reformed.&mdash; And no doubt, had it not been their own fault, they would have become converted and &s;anctified.</P>
<P>THE great and e&s;&s;ential truths of religion are adapted to the conceptions and under&s;tandings of men in common, to tho&s;e of &s;inners as well as &s;aints. But then there are &s;ome things, it is true, hard to be under&s;tood; not becau&s;e of any original ob&s;curity of the language, but on account of the &s;u|blime nature of the &s;ubjects they are upon, which it is im|po&s;&s;ible finite under&s;tandings &s;hould fully comprehend&mdash;and al&s;o on account of our not being acquainted with tho&s;e u&s;ages and cu&s;toms to which they referred, and of which we now
<PB N="8" REF="026261_0007_0FD00BA1C0594778">
have not competent knowledge. Though &s;ome things may on the&s;e accounts be hard to be under&s;tood, yet enough can be known about every part of the &s;criptures, to lead us in the way of &s;alvation. And tho&s;e parts of the holy &s;cripture, which, as to the mode of their exi&s;tence, are hard to be un|der&s;tood, are hard to be under&s;tood by &s;aints as well as &s;in|ners.</P>
<P>A MAN's becoming a good man is not always nece&s;&s;arily attended with any enlargement of his &s;peculative knowledge. A &s;aint may be a babe in knowledge, and a &s;inner may have a very comprehen&s;ive knowledge of the holy &s;criptures. But, were we once to &s;et it down as a fact, that the regenerate only could have a proper knowledge and under&s;tanding of the &s;criptures, we &s;hould make knowledge an evidence of grace. But St. Paul &s;uppo&s;es a man may have all knowledge and un|der&s;tand all my&s;teries, but yet be de&s;titute of charity, be as &s;ounding bra&s;s and a tinkling &s;ymbol. So you may &s;ee, that a man, according to St. Paul, may have a great knowledge of the holy &s;criptures, but not be a man of grace. But, if a true under&s;tanding of the &s;criptures was an evidence of grace, almo&s;t every man would claim it; for every man, in his own judgment, under&s;tands the &s;en&s;e of the holy &s;criptures rightly. And all tho&s;e who are &s;incere in their opinions will conclude, that they are good men, becau&s;e their ideas of the &s;criptures are ju&s;t and proper. And, when this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, men might &s;uppo&s;e they might live in &s;in, but might get &s;afe to heaven if they &s;hould be careful to under&s;tand the &s;criptures in their proper &s;en&s;e, which all men, no doubt, would &s;uppo&s;e that they them&s;elves did.&mdash;A dangerous doctrine this! which St. John in his Epi&s;tle &s;everely condemns.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome per&s;ons are ready to &s;uppo&s;e that the go&s;pel is a &s;y&s;tem of my&s;tici&s;m; and that there is in al|mo&s;t every thing a my&s;tical &s;en&s;e, different from that which is obvious or literal. And this has led &s;ome to explain almo&s;t every doctrine of the holy &s;criptures in a my&s;tical &s;en&s;e, and to overlook the &s;en&s;e that is obvious or literal. But in this way of interpreting the &s;criptures, men may make the holy word of God &s;peak any language they plea&s;e. They may, in this way, explain away all truth; and thus exceedingly di&s;&s;erve the cau&s;e of truth and religion; for they are governed by their wild imaginations and fancies in&s;tead of being governed
<PB N="9" REF="026261_0008_0FD00BA33B16C908">
by the word of God. And, &s;uch men as the&s;e, put them|&s;elves above refutation by arguments founded on the literal or plain &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, by pretending that they are &s;piritual, and can di&s;cern a &s;piritual meaning of the holy &s;criptures, which others cannot. Such a per&s;on will tell you, that ";he that is &s;piritual judgeth all things; yet he him&s;elf is judged of no man." Thus he places him&s;elf, with all his my&s;tici&s;m, above any attack or refutation, becau&s;e he is &s;piritual and can judge all things; and, is &s;o infallibly in the right, that no man can correct him, or prove that he is in the wrong. And thus, by receiving an error, he becomes confirmed in a delu&s;ion, and has nothing for his guide but the &s;pirit within, and makes no u&s;e of the written word. But, I would ob&s;erve, that &s;uch men mi&s;interpret the pa&s;&s;age I have quoted above. The meaning of the pa&s;&s;age is this: He that is &s;piritual, or is taught of God by in&s;piration, or by his word, judgeth of the mind of God by his word revealed; but not by the wi&s;dom of this world or by principles of worldly philo&s;ophy; yet he him&s;elf is judged of no man, as to the truth of what he be|lieves as revealed by God. That is, he is not judged by the worldly wi&s;dom of any man, who argues from the light of mere rea&s;on or the light of nature.&mdash;That is, no man can, by the light of nature, prove that what he believes, as it relates to facts, is not true; becau&s;e his faith is grounded on the te&s;timony of God. But the man who is not &s;piritual, or taught of God by his word, cannot, by arguments of rea&s;on, di&s;prove the validity of this divine te&s;timony; but the man who re&s;ts his faith on this divine te&s;timony will &s;tand firm, notwith&s;tanding all the attacks of men who rea&s;on from mere natural light. This is the true and proper &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;|&s;age.</P>

<P>&mdash;But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him: neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</P>
<P>THOUGH men, who are &s;piritual or are taught of God by his word, cannot be refuted as to their judgment of the truth of facts re&s;ting on divine te&s;timony, yet they may mi&s;take the &s;en&s;e in which &s;ome parts of revelation ought to be under&s;tood; for God does not give his te&s;timony to the truth of every &s;en&s;e in which any man may under&s;tand the &s;criptures: but the &s;en&s;e is to be found out by arguments of rea&s;on grounded on the &s;criptures, or by comparing (as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it) &s;piritual things with &s;piritual, or one part of &s;cripture with another. This being the ca&s;e, men may mi&s;under&s;tand the &s;criptures as to their &s;en&s;e or meaning; yes, even men who are taught of God and believe his word; and they may be in this corrected and refuted: and men may, by &s;cripture arguments, by comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual, convince &s;uch that they were wrong in their under|&s;tanding of this or that doctrine or pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture. So that, though a man who is &s;piritual, or taught of God by re|velation, is, as to his judgment of facts re&s;ting on divine te&s;timony, judged of no man, yet he may mi&s;under&s;tand the &s;en&s;e of &s;ome parts of &s;cripture; and, in this, may be judged of men rea&s;oning out of the &s;criptures&mdash;and may be confu|ted and convinced that he was in the wrong; and he may give up his former &s;en&s;e of this or that doctrine and embrace anoth|er. So that this pa&s;&s;age we have explained will not warrant
<PB N="11" REF="026261_0010_0FD00BA63627B560">
any man in pre&s;uming he is infallibly right in his under&s;tand|ing of all parts of the holy &s;criptures, on account of his be|ing &s;piritual or being taught of God; for the infallible &s;en&s;e in which all parts of revelation are to be under&s;tood, is not by God revealed to any man. Hence we may &s;ee, that tho&s;e that are good men are not infallible in their under&s;tanding of the &s;en&s;e of the &s;cripture, any more than men unconverted.&mdash; But then, I would ob&s;erve, that though good men have no fac|ulty which vicious men have not, to enable them to perceive and know the truth, yet, they making a better u&s;e of their fac|ulties have the advantage of the &s;inner.</P>
<P>THE man who makes a good u&s;e of his perceptive and un|der&s;tanding faculties, becomes better qualified to perceive, know and receive the truth, than a man who makes not &s;uch an u&s;e of them. And, when a man by this right u&s;e and ap|plication of the&s;e faculties, perceives and knows the truth, his moral ta&s;te becomes by the force of truth and the ordina|ry influences of God's &s;pirit corrected. And, he then loves the truth; and con&s;equently, his former prejudices and incli|nations which gave occa&s;ion to him to judge wrongly of the truths of God are mainly removed. When this is done, he, before, will judge more fairly, uprightly and impartially of truth than he would have done under the prevailing prejudi|ces of a wrong ta&s;te and di&s;tempered mind. But, though this be the ca&s;e, yet he has no new faculty of mind. He now has none but what belong to the man as a rational and moral agent. But, he had all that were nece&s;&s;ary to this before his change. His change from &s;in to holine&s;s, does not include the addition of any new faculty to his nature, but only the re|gulation of tho&s;e he had before, and their being brought to their proper u&s;e and exerci&s;e. So that the unregenerate man has all the &s;ame faculties to perceive and under&s;tand the truths of God that regenerated men have. But, the difference be|tween them in their advantages for knowing and receiving the truth, con&s;i&s;ts in the right u&s;e and application the good man makes of his faculties for knowing and doing the will of God, and the bad u&s;e the unregenerate man makes of his. And, hence it is, that we are taught, if any man will do the will of God, he &s;hall know of the doctrine whether it be of God. That is, the man of an hone&s;t de&s;ire and endeavour to plea&s;e God, will be able to di&s;cover in general truth from
<PB N="12" REF="026261_0011_0FD00BA7DB27A900">
error, and will not fatally mi&s;take. Such an one (loving the truth) will u&s;e his faculties in &s;earching after it and judging of and receiving it. Such a man has a good moral ta&s;te or reli&s;h: and in a proper u&s;e of his faculties; becomes &s;anctified by the &s;pirit. But in this &s;anctification, the &s;pirit of God gives no new faculty; but only (by the means of grace) brings the common faculties of the man to their proper u&s;e and exerci&s;e. And then the man has a view of the importance of the truth that he had not before, and greatly delights to know and receive it. But yet, his &s;peculative knowledge of it, may be the &s;ame as before; nor may, perhaps, his knowledge be in|crea&s;ed. But what he knows, he knows more affectingly, and believes heartily, &s;o that, by the truth he becomes &s;ancti|fied. Hence it is evident, that &s;inners not knowing the things of God revealed in his word, is not owing to a want of fa|culty or ability, but to a mi&s;u&s;e and abu&s;e of the faculties God has given them. Therefore, it is po&s;&s;ible for them in the proper u&s;e of their mental faculties, to know the will of God, revealed, as well as &s;aints; yes, even the mo&s;t incom|prehen&s;ible truths: for things incomprehen&s;ible, cannot be under&s;tood either by good men or bad. And, when men pretend to be able (becau&s;e they are &s;piritual) to under&s;tand and explain every thing, and pretend that revelation is &s;uch a my&s;tery that unregenerate men can have no proper under|&s;tanding of it, they have given them&s;elves up to the mo&s;t un|bounded enthu&s;ia&s;m and delu&s;ion. The go&s;pel of Chri&s;t or the things revealed in it, are not, in the &s;cripture &s;en&s;e, my&s;te|ries. There are &s;ome things in it, it is true, hard to be un|der&s;tood as to the manner of their exi&s;tence; and which we cannot comprehend. But the facts or truths related, con&s;idered as facts, are not incomprehen&s;ible, or in other words there is no ab&s;urdity in the &s;uppo&s;ition of their exi&s;tence; becau&s;e, they are not contrary to rea&s;on, though rea&s;on would not di&s;cover them, and they are demon&s;trated by divine te&s;timony. And be &s;ure, there is no ab&s;urdity in that being true, which is grounded on divine te&s;timony, or in our believing it to be true. So that the facts and truths related in the go&s;pel are plain. And, that they exi&s;t, is not incomprehen&s;ible: for, it is demon|&s;trated by the te&s;timony of God that they do. And the belief of the&s;e truths or facts objectively, is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alva|tion. But, that we mu&s;t know and believe them in this or
<PB N="13" REF="026261_0012_0FD00BAAB46DEBB8">
that &s;en&s;e, as one man or another &s;hall explain them, may not be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;alvation of this or that per&s;on, becau&s;e God has not made it &s;o; and, e&s;pecially, when the mode of the exi&s;tence of &s;uch truths or facts, is incomprehen&s;ible. But things in the manner of their exi&s;tence incomprehen&s;ible, are incomprehen&s;ible to &s;aints as well as &s;inners: but, things not &s;o, may, by unconverted men, be under&s;tood, or they may have a &s;peculative knowledge of them as well as &s;aints can; and, therefore, tho&s;e who pretend, that becau&s;e they are converted men, they can under&s;tand every thing of the truths of revelation, and that &s;inners can know nothing, are deceiving and being deceived. And, that pretence, that the &s;cripture cannot be under&s;tood by any but &s;anctified per&s;ons, becau&s;e they are all or the greater part of them my&s;terious, is going on a fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>AN Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, they, the Apo&s;tles, "u&s;ed in their preaching great plainne&s;s of &s;peech," which does not well <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> with the idea of <HI>their</HI> preaching my&s;teriou&s;ly, and in general, unintelligibly. The doctrine of the re&s;urrection of the dead, is a&s;&s;erted and proved; and we believe it, and can comprehend the truth of the fact. But we cannot comprehend the manner of it, which is quite a different thing. Nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation that we &s;hould. The re&s;urrection of the dead, and the change of tho&s;e (that &s;hall be alive) in the twinkling of an eye, at the &s;ounding the la&s;t trump, St. Paul calls a my&s;tery; but he meant it was a my&s;tery before, or a thing before it was revealed, unknown, whether the dead &s;hould be rai&s;ed, or what would be done with tho&s;e who &s;hould be alive when our Lord &s;hould come to judgment. But he did not mean this was a my&s;tery after it was revealed; for he &s;ays, "I &s;hew you a my&s;tery." But, when a truth is &s;hewn or known, it cea&s;es to be a my&s;tery. There are many things in the go&s;pel, which were &s;aid to be my&s;terious, that is before they were revealed or made known, but not afterward; for when a truth is known, the my&s;tery cea&s;es. The word my&s;|tery refers to things not made known or revealed; but not to &s;uch as are.</P>
<P>BUT good men cannot know things not revealed any more than men of different characters. But things made known or revealed are not my&s;teries; and, therefore, they may be known and under&s;tood by men of all de&s;criptions, if they will
<PB N="14" REF="026261_0013_0FD00BAC43D4B680">
make a proper u&s;e of their faculties. But though there are &s;ome things in the go&s;pel hard to be under&s;tood; or, as to the manner of their exi&s;tence incomprehen&s;ible, yet, the&s;e are not the truths, when revealed, that are in the &s;cripture &s;tile called my&s;teries. But my&s;teries are things not revealed, and, while they &s;o remain, cannot be believed or known. But after they are revealed and known, may and mu&s;t be believed; and then they cea&s;e to be my&s;teries. So that tho&s;e men who pretend becau&s;e they are &s;piritual, that they can explain and know things my&s;terious which others cannot, are in a delu&s;ion. That which is revealed is not a my&s;tery, and therefore, it may by others be known and under&s;tood. But that which is not revealed is a my&s;tery: therefore, it can|not be known or under&s;tood. And hence, it is folly for any to pretend to know or explain the meaning of it, though he may be &s;anctified by the &s;pirit of God. But a per&s;on's hav|ing the influences of the &s;pirit of God, by which he becomes &s;anctified in the right u&s;e of his faculties or a good improve|ment of the means of grace, does not imply or include an ex|traordinary gift of the &s;pirit to know the will of God. Or|dinary and extraordinary gifts do not involve each other. The man who is endowed with the one, may not nece&s;&s;arily be endowed with the other: but, they are di&s;tinct in their nature, and one may exi&s;t in a per&s;on who is de&s;titute of the other. And therefore, it does not follow, that (becau&s;e a man is regenerated) he has a faculty of di&s;cerning the will and coun|&s;els of God in in&s;tances wherein others have not.</P>
<P>EXTRAORDINARY gifts, and e&s;pecially the gift of in&s;piration, by which per&s;ons become acquainted with the coun&s;els and will of God, were not, in apo&s;tolic times, de&s;igned &s;o much for the benefit of tho&s;e to whom they were given, as for the benefit of others. They were given to enable per&s;ons to preach and &s;pread the truths of the go&s;pel to bring men to repentance, faith and holine&s;s. And, &s;uch as were endowed with the&s;e &s;piritual gifts, were tho&s;e who were denominated &s;piritual, knowing the mind of the &s;pirit, and judging all things, and being judged of no man. It does not appear that, in apo&s;tolic times, the common graces of the &s;pirit in|cluded a &s;pirit of in&s;piration and prophecy. It appears that the apo&s;tle exhorted chri&s;tians to covet to prophecy; and hence, it appears, they might be chri&s;tians though they had not this
<PB N="15" REF="026261_0014_0FD00BADC0BB60C0">
extraordinary gift. The graces of the &s;pirit, &s;uch as faith, love, joy, peace, long &s;uffering, meekne&s;s, temperance, and patience are common to all chri&s;tians in all ages. Nor can any be chri&s;tians without them. The&s;e are conveyed to the mind by common and ordinary operations of the &s;pirit, but not by extraordinary. Therefore per&s;ons may be chri&s;tians without the&s;e extraordinary gifts, and without the extraordi|nary operation of the &s;pirit. Therefore men may be chri&s;|tians and po&s;&s;e&s;s all the ordinary graces of the &s;pirit, but yet not be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any extraordinary capacity on this account to know the mind of God, wherein it was not before revealed.</P>
<P>THE &s;pirit of God does not in its ordinary operations in conver&s;ion, convey any new truths to the mind not revealed before&mdash;It only awakens the mind to attention to tho&s;e al|ready revealed, and gives them a &s;anctifying effect upon the heart. But the &s;pirit gives no new revelation, no new truth: therefore it is a delu&s;ion to pretend to know more of the mind of God, even after conver&s;ion, than we can learn from the holy &s;criptures.&mdash;Therefore unregenerated men may have as much &s;peculative knowledge of the &s;criptures as others; if they are not gro&s;&s;ly deficient in the u&s;e of their rational fac|ulties in re&s;pect to enquiry. Therefore the words of out text mean not that all unregenerate men are incapable of knowing the things of the &s;pirit of God, or that they cannot, by the ordinary influences of the &s;pirit, receive them. But the natural man, &s;poken of in the text, is the philo&s;opher who depends on human wi&s;dom and mere rea&s;on, and will not ad|mit revelation.&mdash;Such an one cannot know the things of God, his coun&s;els and purpo&s;es; and will not receive them, becau&s;e they cannot be di&s;cerned and known by mere human rea&s;on or natural light. But unregenerate men; who will enquire for truth, and are di&s;po&s;ed to attend to and receive the word of God, may know it. They are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a capacity to di&s;|tingui&s;h between truth and error: and there is nothing to prevent their knowing the mind and will of God, but the&s;e mi&s;u&s;e and mi&s;improvement of their mental faculties.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hall now offer &s;omething to help our improvement of what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>AND, from what has been &s;aid, we may &s;ee the inexcu&s;e|ablene&s;s of all &s;inners in living in the practice of &s;in, and in rejecting the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="026261_0015_0FD00BAF45650EC8">IF it was a fact, that all mankind before their regeneration, were entirely incapable of knowing the will of God, or the things revealed by God, be&s;ure they would not have any re|ligious knowledge to abu&s;e, or con&s;equently any to an&s;wer for before God.&mdash;Therefore they could not ju&s;tly be puni&s;h|ed for the mi&s;u&s;e or abu&s;e of any&mdash;Much le&s;s would they be liable to be puni&s;hed with an aggravated puni&s;hment for rejecting the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; for they could not be obliged to know that which they could not know or under&s;tand; or to believe that which they could not obtain a knowledge of; or receive and conform to that rule of conduct in which they could have no belief. Therefore, was it impo&s;&s;ible for &s;in|ners to know the will of God, or &s;uch a mea&s;ure of it as is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, they &s;urely could not be puni&s;hed for their not accepting the offers of the go&s;pel; for he only who knows his ma&s;ter's will, will be puni&s;hed for not conforming to it: but he that has or might have a con&s;iderable knowledge of it, will be beaten with many &s;tripes. Therefore, per&s;ons who know nothing, nor can know any thing of the will of God (in the day of judgment) will have nothing to an&s;wer for. But all &s;inners, who know much of his will, will be puni&s;hed with great &s;everity. But all &s;inners under go&s;pel light, may know much of the will of God; for they who trample under foot the Son of God, will have great condem|nation, becau&s;e great light has &s;hone upon them. They lov|ed darkne&s;s better than light becau&s;e their deeds were evil. But if they had not great light, they would not be great &s;in|ners. But for us to &s;ay that &s;inners cannot know or are not capable of knowing the things of God or his will, &s;o as to lead them by proper improvement of their faculties to practi&s;e accordingly, is excluding &s;inners from guilt.&mdash;It is encourag|ing them in &s;in, and lulling them to &s;leep in a &s;tate of carnal &s;ecurity, which is the mo&s;t certain road to perdition. A more dangerous doctrine than this could not be inculcated. It at once, defeats the great end of revelation, and the end for which man was made a rational creature. It is impeaching the Judge of the world with inju&s;tice, in inflicting puni&s;hment on tho&s;e who know not his will, nor could know it.</P>
<P>BUT will not the Judge of all the earth do right? Will he puni&s;h tho&s;e who could not know his will, in the &s;ame manner that he will tho&s;e who do know it? Shall a man give an
<PB N="17" REF="026261_0016_0FD00BB42B748AD0">
account for ten or even one talent, when he has received none? If &s;o, there is an end of all trial of rational beings. Nor is there any rule in judgment. But this is not the ca&s;e. There is no &s;inner under heaven, that will by God, be chargeable with guilt, who could not know what his duty was. Nor will there be a &s;inner in the day of judgment, that will be puni&s;h|ed with an aggravated condemnation, for rejecting the great &s;alvation, who could not obtain by all the helps and grace of God a &s;aving knowledge of it, or &s;uch a knowledge as would have terminated in &s;alvation, had it been in the be&s;t manner improved. And this is a doctrine that is &s;o evidently true from our ideas of the ju&s;tice of God and the holy &s;criptures, that every hone&s;t and unprejudiced mind will a&s;&s;ent to it. And we may talk what we will about &s;inners being ju&s;tly damned, when God never enabled them to e&s;cape damnation, but laid them under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning, and remaining in &s;in, but all our rea&s;onings upon it will be contrary to common &s;en&s;e, the ju&s;tice of God, and the plain declarations of his word, which a&s;&s;ert, that God delighteth not in the death of a &s;inner; that puni&s;hment is his &s;trange work; and that Chri&s;t died for all; and that the &s;inner will not come to Chri&s;t that he might have life. Is this all con&s;i&s;tent with God's damning the &s;inner, when he could never know &s;avingly his will, and when God never by his grace enabled him to do his will or to accept the great &s;alvation? No&mdash;it is impo&s;&s;ible: and I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that all who have any re&s;pect for God's character, would be very cau|tious of a&s;&s;erting any &s;uch thing. But &s;urely all &s;inners are in great danger of the judgment of God, becau&s;e God has enabled them more or le&s;s to know and do his will, and, e&s;|pecially, to accept the great &s;alvation.</P>
<P>LET not &s;inners, therefore, under go&s;pel light, re&s;t in a &s;tate of carnal &s;ecurity, by flattering them&s;elves that they cannot know &s;avingly the truths of God, or receive them or do any thing by &s;triving for regeneration, till God has given them &s;ome new faculty to enable them to di&s;cern divine things, for a new faculty is not to be expected; but it is their bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;trive to improve aright the faculties God has already given; and, in order to this, to improve the go&s;pel revelation, to &s;tudy to know and do the will of God, to believe in his Son affect|ingly,
<PB N="18" REF="026261_0017_0FCF4BA9D9F9F6A0">
to repent of all &s;in, depending on Gods grace to help and &s;anctify them. Though they mu&s;t receive &s;trength from God, yet it mu&s;t be expected only in their &s;trivings; for he that buries his talent &s;hall be ca&s;t into utter darkne&s;s: that is, he that &s;trives not to make a proper u&s;e of his faculties in the good improvements of the gifts of God, e&s;pecially the reve|lation of the go&s;pel, &s;hall be damned.</P>
<P>IT is a mo&s;t dangerous doctrine to hold up to &s;inners, that they cannot po&s;&s;ibly do any thing in order to becoming chri&s;|tians, but that they mu&s;t become &s;o by the immediate and ex|traordinary operations of the &s;pirit by an impul&s;e they cannot re&s;i&s;t; for this at once excu&s;es the &s;inner from blame in not becoming a chri&s;tian; and it is a&s;&s;cribing his impenitency and unbelief to God, who affords not &s;ufficient grace for the &s;inner to become a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>THOUGH it might doubtle&s;s have been ju&s;t in God to have left the man to peri&s;h, who had once &s;inned, yet &s;ince the go&s;pel revelation has been given, and the grace of God hath appeared, it is not con&s;i&s;tent with the declarations of God, to &s;uppo&s;e that he will leave the &s;inner without afford|ing aid to enable him to embrace &s;alvation or the go&s;pel; for in ca&s;e he does not, he is threatened with a greater puni&s;h|ment than he would have been worthy of had not the go&s;pel revelation been given, or had he not rejected it.&mdash;But this could not be, unle&s;s the go&s;pel was con&s;idered as a talent for him to improve; nor, unle&s;s he could have improved it, or believed in it, by the grace of God, and practi&s;ed according to it.</P>
<P>LET not &s;inners, then, through pretended ignorance of the truths of God, or inability to receive them and practice &s;in|cerely according to them, encourage them&s;elves in &s;in; for it is a delu&s;ion, which, if per&s;i&s;ted in, will be fatal in its con|&s;equences. But let them realize, that if they &s;trive not they will never enter into re&s;t, or be intere&s;ted in the great &s;alva|tion. Let them rou&s;e up from their &s;lumbers&mdash;cry to God for help, tru&s;ting in him with all their heart, for grace and &s;trength, and they will derive grace and &s;trength from him. Their &s;trength in &s;triving depends on their tru&s;t in the grace and promi&s;es of God. Let them withdraw their tru&s;t in God's grace, and they will become weak and impotent. Let
<PB N="19" REF="026261_0018_0FD00BB608C9C180">
them put their tru&s;t in him for help and &s;trength, and they will receive them; and this will give efficacy to all their &s;triv|ings. Let them &s;tudy and meditate on the word of God, and pray, and mourn for &s;in and be watchful again&s;t it, repent of, and for&s;ake it. Let them re&s;olve to devote them&s;elves to Chri&s;t, and to make his go&s;pel their guide in faith and practice: and in this way of &s;triving and walking in the pre&s;ence of God, and tru&s;ting in him to help them, they will be in the way to become new born and ve&s;&s;els of honour &s;anctified to every good work. To &s;uch God hath &s;aid, "a&s;k and it &s;hall be given you, &s;eek and ye &s;hall find, knock and it &s;hall be opened to you." Upon &s;uch the grace of God, will no doubt, be effectual to the &s;alvation of the &s;oul: for our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour hath &s;aid, He "will not break the brui&s;ed reed, or quench the &s;moaking flax, but will &s;end forth judgment unto victory."</P>
