<OPENER><DATELINE>BOSTON,
<DATE>May 30, 1774.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I THANK you for your kind letter, wherein you expre&s;s a tender concern for the people of Bo&s;ton, and &s;ympathize with them, under the hard trial they mu&s;t pa&s;s through, in con&s;equence of the late parliamentary act, commonly &s;poken of under the name of the Bo&s;ton port-bill. It is a general idea only of the &s;ufferings we mu&s;t endure that has excited in you tho&s;e motions of grief and pity, of which you have the perceptions; for, being at a di&s;tance, and not being di&s;tinctly acquainted with that multiplicity of ways in which this barbarous act will
<PB N="4" REF="013197_0003_0F9045CC4371ED70">
operate to di&s;tre&s;s us, your conception of our &s;ufferings, by means of it, mu&s;t fall va&s;tly below the greatne&s;s of them. It will not therefore be di&s;plea&s;ing, though it &s;hould add &s;ome degree of impetuo&s;ity to your pa&s;&s;ions, which al|ready give you unea&s;ine&s;s, if I am par|ticular in pointing out to you tho&s;e avenues this horred decree has opened to let in mi&s;ery upon us.</P>
<P>BE plea&s;ed then to con&s;ider, not the well-being only, but the &s;upport of this town is almo&s;t wholly dependent upon trade, the carrying on of which makes way for imployment, and employment procures daily bread for at lea&s;t eight tenths of its inhabitants. Exten&s;ive trade, you will be &s;en&s;ible, if you only allow your&s;elf to think a while, natur|ally gives ri&s;e to a great variety of oc|cupations, which occupations give a livelihood to hundreds and thou&s;ands. It mu&s;t therefore amazingly &s;pread di&s;|tre&s;s in &s;o large a commercial place as this metropolis of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Province, to have its inhabitants in an
<PB N="5" REF="013197_0004_0F9045CD24C9C150">
in&s;tant, as it were, put out of all capa|city of employing them&s;elves in any of tho&s;e va&s;tly various callings, on which alone, under God, they had their de|pendence for a &s;upply with even the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Few, comparatively very few in Bo&s;ton, are men of inde|pendent fortunes. The people here are almo&s;t univer&s;ally laborers or arti|ficers of this or the other denomination, who, by this act which has &s;topped the cour&s;e of trade, are totally deprived of the only means of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This is the ca&s;e of our &s;hip-builders, &s;hip-joiners, ma&s;t-makers, riggers, caulk|ers, rope and &s;ail-makers; who&s;e oc|cupations gave them and their depend|ents a comfortable maintenance: This is the ca&s;e of our hou&s;e-carpenters and ma&s;ons, who have now little to do, either in the way of building or repair|ing hou&s;es; as timber, boards, &s;hingles, brick and lime are not permitted to be brought into the town in any ve&s;&s;el whatever, from any part of the province or el&s;ewhere: This is the ca&s;e of our di&s;tillers and &s;ugar boilers; who are at
<PB N="6" REF="013197_0005_0F9045D352B0BE88">
once incapacitated for carrying on that bu&s;ine&s;s which was their &s;upport; as neither mola&s;&s;es nor &s;ugar are &s;uffered to come into Bo&s;ton-harbor: This is the ca&s;e with our coopers; who, if they could procure &s;taves and hoops could make little or no u&s;e of them, as the work of trimming imported ca&s;ks and making others for exportation, has, at pre&s;ent, an unhappy period put to it: This is the ca&s;e al&s;o of our truckmen, porters, and a numerous train of day-laborers, who will now be nece&s;&s;i|tated to become idlers, and mu&s;t &s;uffer hunger, and be cloathed with rags.</P>
<P>BY this enumeration of our tribes of workmen, you will readily perceive, that va&s;t numbers, not le&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;e (taking in their wives, children and &s;ervants, who are dependent upon them) than fifteen thou&s;and at the lowe&s;t com|putation, are reduced to a &s;tarving condition; none of which, &s;o far as is known, had any more an hand in the de&s;truction of the Ea&s;t-India company's tea, then Lord North him&s;elf; and but
<PB N="7" REF="013197_0006_0F9045D633A8B758">
a few of them comparatively were among tho&s;e who con&s;tituted the a&s;&s;emblies who have been complained of as riotous. Nor are the &s;ufferings occa&s;ioned by this act confined to the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton; but extend to all in our towns on the &s;ea &s;hore, for hundreds of miles, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is that of coa&s;ting, as they are forcibly re&s;trained from bring|ing to this port any merchandize from the places where they live, or from carrying any out of it, to the towns to which they belong, though their nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould ever &s;o loudly call for it: Yea, &s;uch is the cruelty of this act, that none of the people in our in|land towns can &s;o much as cro&s;s the ferry from Charle&s;town to Bo&s;ton with any of their goods for &s;ale, but by ex|po&s;ing both their goods, and the boat that brings them, to a &s;eizure by tho&s;e who&s;e tender mercies are cruelties: Yea further, no merchandize of any &s;ort is permitted to be brought from either Marblehead or Salem, the port &s;ub&s;ti|tuted in the room of Bo&s;ton, but by land carriage, which, though greatly ex|pen&s;ive,
<PB N="8" REF="013197_0007_0F9045D6B58AD150">
is made almo&s;t doubly &s;o; as in&s;tead of fifteen miles only, by going over a ferry, the nece&s;&s;ary carriage is now no le&s;s than twenty eight; which is as di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the merchants in their towns, as to tho&s;e in Bo&s;ton, and as much complained of. In an addre&s;s from an hundred and twenty-five mer|chants and freeholders at Salem, to his Excellency Governor Gage, in which they have done them&s;elves great honor, are the&s;e words; "In &s;hutting up the port of Bo&s;ton, &s;ome imagine that the cour&s;e of trade might be turned hither, and to our benefit. But nature, in the formation of our harbor, forbids our becoming rivals in commerce with that convenient mart. And were it other|wi&s;e, we mu&s;t be dead to every idea of ju&s;tice, and to all feelings of humanity, could we indulge one thought to &s;eize on wealth, and rai&s;e our fortunes on the ruin of our &s;uffering neighbors. But &s;o far from receiving benefit, we are greatly injured by the &s;hutting up the harbor of Bo&s;ton, as it deprives us of a market for much the large&s;t part of our
<PB N="9" REF="013197_0008_0F9045D775341630">
We&s;t-India imports; and there is not a town in the province but will feel the ill effects of it. Permit us then, &s;ir, to apply to your clemency and ju&s;tice to afford us every alleviation in your power, and to procure for us every po&s;&s;ible relief from this exten&s;ive mi&s;|chief." To what can this multiplica|tion of trouble and charge be a&s;cribed but to the want of knowledge of the country, or a de&s;ign wantonly to en|large our di&s;tre&s;s by the exerci&s;e of &s;ove|reign power? Who could have imagined, that a decree thus mixed with contri|ved &s;everity, and thus big with di&s;tre&s;s and ruin to thou&s;ands of poor inno|cents, could have had exi&s;tence given it by an Engli&s;h parliament! Is it po&s;|&s;ible filial affection to the parent-&s;tate &s;hould hereby be promoted? What, in the natural cour&s;e of things, can be the effect of &s;o cruel an edict, but the &s;tir|ring up a &s;pirit of re&s;entment? And if multitudes, by being reduced to a &s;tarv|ing de&s;perate condition, &s;hould act a wild and mad part, who would be &s;o much to blame as tho&s;e who were the occa&s;ional cau&s;e of it?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="013197_0009_0F9045D836E36440">BUT it will be &s;aid, provi&s;ion is made in the act that &s;huts up the harbor of Bo&s;ton, for its being opened again; in&s;omuch that it will be our own fault, if the difficulties we complain of are not removed. It is a proper que&s;tion here, why were the&s;e difficulties brought upon us at all in an ab&s;olute and un|conditional way? Had terms of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion been connected with puni&s;h|ment as threatned only, &s;o as that it might have been at our own option, whether we would &s;ubmit&punc; or &s;uffer; the rea&s;on for complaint would have been far le&s;s than it now is. But with|out previous warning, in the propo&s;al of any terms that might have prevented the coming of evil on us, it is inflicted with ine&s;&s;able vengeance, and under &s;uch circum&s;tances, that &s;hould we, in the mo&s;t &s;ervile manner, &s;ubmit to all that is required, we mu&s;t notwith&s;tand|ing inevitably &s;uffer almo&s;t total ruin. For the act will be in full force the fir&s;t day of June, and will remain &s;o till a certificate from the Governor, &s;etting forth our entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="11" REF="013197_0010_0F9045D900DECB28">
and obedience, is tran&s;mitted to the King, and relief, in con&s;equence of it, is granted to us by him in privy coun|cil; which every one knows is impo&s;&s;i|ble to be done, till hundreds are &s;tarv|ed to death, if not provided for by heaven in &s;ome unknown way or other.</P>
<P>AND not only are we laid under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uffering by this act to an extreme degree, though we &s;hould be ever &s;o obedient to its requirements; but (truely melancholy to con&s;ider) the terms &s;pecified in it, upon which alone our &s;ufferings are to be removed, far from being fixed with preci&s;ion, are &s;o loo&s;e and indeterminate, that a Govern|or may, &s;hould he &s;o plea&s;e, perpetuate them during his political exi&s;tence; as, without a certificate from him, de|claring our compliance with the parlia|mentary demands, the King him&s;elf in privy council is not enabled to open the port of Bo&s;ton; nor is any other way provided for its being done.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="013197_0011_0F9045D9B818FA28">A FURTHER aggravation of our &s;uf|ferings, and what gives the keene&s;t edge to them is, that the wharfs and landing-places in the town of Bo&s;ton, which are the property of numerous individuals, and of a much greater value than all the teas the Ea&s;t-India company have &s;ent to this whole continent, are, as to the u&s;e of them, wherein only their value con|&s;i&s;ts, wre&s;ted out of their hands, and put into the King's, to be di&s;po&s;ed of at his plea&s;ure. The city of London, we imagine, however highly and ju&s;tly they may think of the King's wi&s;dom and benevolence, would, with one united voice complain of tyranny, a bare-faced inva&s;ion of their rights, if they were thus re&s;trained from the u&s;e of this or the other valuable part of their property, unle&s;s by a granted licence at the plea&s;ure of his Maje&s;ty. The inhabitants of Bo&s;ton are Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, as well as the citizens of Lon|don and may with equal ju&s;tice utter their cries again&s;t that arbitrary exer|ci&s;e of power, which indi&s;criminately makes the u&s;e of their rightful property
<PB N="13" REF="013197_0012_0F9045DA844F4198">
dependent on plea&s;ure at three thou&s;and miles di&s;tance: Nor may it be thought &s;trange, if their groans &s;hould be loud and bitter: E&s;pecially, as this in&s;tance of de&s;poti&s;m is added to complete hard&s;hips in other re&s;pects cruel in their nature, and extreme in degree, beyond what might have been expected, in like circum&s;tances, from either France or Spain.</P>
<P>WHAT now could be the excite|ment to this extraordinary vengeance? The preamble to the act of parliament will inform us.</P>
<P>IT begins with mentioning "Dan|gerous commotions and in&s;urrections fomented and rai&s;ed in the town of Bo&s;|ton, by diver&s;e ill-affected per&s;ons." But was Bo&s;ton the only place in Ame|rica, where there had been &s;uch com|motions? Might it not, with equal truth, have been &s;aid, that like "com|motions and in&s;urrections had been fo|mented and rai&s;ed" in New-York, Philadelphia, and other American co|lonies? And yet, Bo&s;ton only is the &s;elect|ed
<PB N="14" REF="013197_0013_0F9045DB387527D0">
object of re&s;entment, and to a de|gree not ea&s;ily to be paralleled! Does this carry the face of impartial ju&s;tice? Some Bo&s;tonians who have been in Eng|land, and &s;ome who were born there, have a&s;&s;ured us, and upon their own know|ledge, that "commotions and in&s;ur|rections," in the late times of public grievance, have frequently been "fo|mented and rai&s;ed" in the city of Lon|don, and to a much greater and more dangerous height than they ever were at Bo&s;ton: But that city, as &s;uch, we have not been told, was ever puni&s;hed at all for the&s;e riotous di&s;orders, much le&s;s with a &s;everity portending it's de|&s;truction. Would Bo&s;ton have been thus cruelly dealt with, had not it's di&s;|tance from Great Britain been &s;o great, that it's groans, under the weight of oppre&s;&s;ion, could not be heard there, &s;o as to move either indignation or com|pa&s;&s;ion, in our brethren of the mother country?</P>
<P>BUT it is &s;aid of the&s;e commotions, that they were "fomented and rai&s;ed
<PB N="15" REF="013197_0014_0F9045DBF77AED38">
to the &s;ubver&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty's go|vernment, and to the utter de&s;truction of the public peace and good order of the &s;aid town." It may with exact truth be affirmed, that "ill-affected per&s;ons" did not foment the&s;e commo|tions with the lea&s;t view to manife&s;t di&s;loyalty to his Maje&s;ty, or to "&s;ubvert his government" as con&s;titutionally ex|erci&s;ed; but to endeavour, in the only way they had left, to fru&s;trate the de|&s;igns of tho&s;e, who, by fal&s;e and inju|rious repre&s;entations, would deceive his Maje&s;ty, &s;o as to be permitted to bring this country into bondage. It is well known, both at home and here, that we have often made our humble com|plaints of grievances two great to be ea&s;y under. And what has been the effect, but a contemptuous deafne&s;s to our cries for relief? To this it is owing, and this only, that there have been any unde&s;irable commotions among us. And &s;hall we be forcibly reduced to the la&s;t extremity of mi&s;ery, becau&s;e we cannot any longer patiently bear that which is intolerable? Had we not
<PB N="16" REF="013197_0015_0F9045DCB8FE0AC8">
been oppre&s;&s;ed, and to an high degree, there would not have been the lea&s;t di&s;turbance in the town, or province. And &s;hould it be true, that oppre&s;&s;ion has made "diver&s;e per&s;ons ill-affected," and excited them to rai&s;e unwarrant|able commotions, mu&s;t thou&s;ands of innocents be puni&s;hed herefor with the utmo&s;t &s;everity? Is this rea&s;onable? Can it be made to con&s;i&s;t with equity? Could it have been, had the common feelings of humanity operated without ob&s;tructions? The Bo&s;tonians have al|ways been as much di&s;po&s;ed to honor and &s;upport con&s;titutional government, as any of the people in England; and it is one of their greate&s;t burdens that they &s;hould be brought into &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, as to be even forced into that which is highly di&s;agreeable to them; and if "the good order of Bo&s;|ton" has in any mea&s;ure, been di&s;|turbed, the way to re&s;tore peace is to hear our cries, and redre&s;s our griev|ances. This, and this only, will do it effectually, and la&s;tingly. Force may for a while keep the people under re|&s;traint;
<PB N="17" REF="013197_0016_0F9045DD75D25200">
but this very re&s;traint may, in time, be the occa&s;ion of the out-break|ing of their pa&s;&s;ions with the greater violence; and what the con&s;equence, in that ca&s;e, will be, God only knows.</P>
<P>A FURTHER rea&s;on given for the pa&s;&s;ing this act is, that in the&s;e commo|tions, "certain valuable cargoes of teas, being the property of the Ea&s;t-India company, and on board certain ve&s;&s;els lying within the bay or harbor of Bo&s;|ton, were &s;eized and de&s;troyed." Some, even in England, have wrote with great &s;trength and &s;pirit in defence of the de&s;truction of tho&s;e teas, under the &s;pecial circum&s;tances in which they were &s;ent here. But &s;hould it be ad|mitted, that this de&s;truction was un|warrantable, both in the view of rea|&s;on and law, will it follow from hence that the town of Bo&s;ton ought to be put into a &s;tate of &s;uffering, which it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould live under, un|le&s;s &s;upplies are &s;ent to them from the other towns, in this, or the neighbour|ing colonies? It &s;hould always be re|membered,
<PB N="18" REF="013197_0017_0F9045DE39C951D8">
the tea-de&s;truction was ef|fected by per&s;ons in di&s;gui&s;e, and un|known even to this day. Bo&s;ton, as a town, neither advi&s;ed to it, nor did any thing to bring it into event: Nay, even tho&s;e very people, who&s;e a&s;&s;em|bling together two or three times in Bo&s;ton, has been called unlawful and riotous, were &s;o far from de&s;igning, or &s;o much as de&s;iring, this de&s;truction, that they did all that lay in their pow|er to prevent it: Nor would the tea have been de&s;troyed, had it not been for Governor Hutchin&s;on, the collector (under the eye of the commi&s;&s;ioners) and the con&s;ignees, to whom alone it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed, that it came to this end: Nor were the people, who&s;e a&s;|&s;embling together has been &s;o bitterly complained of, the inhabitants of Bo&s;|ton only, but of many other towns in the province. The&s;e are all known, certain truths. And yet, Bo&s;ton, as a town, is con&s;idered as chargeable with this de&s;truction, and puni&s;hed for it in an awfully &s;evere manner; and this too, without giving them notice of
<PB N="19" REF="013197_0018_0F9045DFB5BE0E80">
their crime, or opportunity of &s;aying a word in defence of them&s;elves. If this is not uncon&s;titutional, arbitrary con|duct, mankind in common, will, I am &s;ure, call it rigorou&s;ly hard and cruel.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t thing &s;aid, in order to pro|mote the giving life to this act, is, that "in the pre&s;ent condition of the &s;aid town and harbor, the commerce of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects cannot be &s;afely carri|ed on, nor the cu&s;toms payable to his Maje&s;ty, collected." There is not a more known truth, than that the commerce of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects has not been by this town, in it's "pre&s;ent conditi|on," or by any "ill-affected per&s;ons" in it, in the lea&s;t mea&s;ure ob&s;tructed, unle&s;s in the &s;ingle article of the Ea&s;t-India company's teas; nor have his Maje&s;ty's officers been at all hindred from col|lecting the payable cu&s;toms, excepting only in this &s;ame article; nor was there ever any difficulty even as to this, till in a late in&s;tance or two. And &s;o far was "the commerce of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects" from being ob&s;tructed in other articles by what was done in this, that
<PB N="20" REF="013197_0019_0F9045DFDEC1F278">
the utmo&s;t care was taken to prevent it: Nor is there a per&s;on in Bo&s;ton who will &s;ay, unle&s;s he knowingly wrongs the truth, that the de&s;truction of the teas was the occa&s;ion of his &s;uffering as to any other kind of merchandize, tho' &s;ent in the &s;ame &s;hips that brought the teas. The mini&s;try well knew, that not Bo&s;ton, or the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-pro|vince only, but all the American colo|nies were united as one in thinking it uncon&s;titutional to be taxed by the par|liament, as they are not repre&s;ented there, nor can be, by rea&s;on of their lo|cal di&s;tance; and they have been ju&s;|tified in this &s;entiment by &s;ome of the greate&s;t men at home, who have &s;aid that in defence of it, which the colo|nies are fully &s;atisfied cannot be con|tradicted incon&s;i&s;tency with the acknow|ledged right of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects. It is &s;trange therefore, that what was done, with re&s;pect to the article of the teas on|ly &s;hould be the occa&s;ion of exciting mini&s;terial wrath to &s;uch an amazing height: E&s;pecially, as it was owing, if faulty, to an error in judgment, not per|ver&s;ene&s;s
<PB N="21" REF="013197_0020_0F9045E082C30FD0">
of di&s;po&s;ition: It is more &s;trange that this conduct &s;hould be con&s;idered as a general ob&s;truction to commerce, and to the collection of payable cu&s;|toms, when neither the one nor the other, as to other articles, were in the lea&s;t affected thereby: It is more &s;trange &s;till, that Bo&s;ton only &s;hould be the ob|ject of re&s;entment, when New-York, and Philadelphia, were chargeable with the like, but greater fault, proceeding from one and the &s;ame principle: It is mo&s;t of all &s;trange, that Bo&s;ton, had it been the only faulty town, and de&s;erving of puni&s;hment, &s;hould have it inflicted with cruelty unmixed with mercy, and &s;o as to make no di&s;tinction between one and another; but involving all in one common &s;tate of di&s;tre&s;s, greater in degree and extent than Scotland, or any of it's towns, were obliged to &s;uf|fer, though commotions were fomented and rai&s;ed there, within the memory of thou&s;ands now living, and with a pro|fe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign to dethrone King George the &s;econd, and to place the crown of England on the head of a Popi&s;h Pre|tender.
<PB N="22" REF="013197_0021_0F9045E142DF9498">
Does this look like ju&s;tice im|partially executed? May it not be rea|&s;onably thought, that other ends might be in view be&s;ides that of puni&s;hment, upon the foot of ju&s;t de&s;ert? Nor would it exceed the view even of an American under&s;tanding to conceive what the&s;e other ends might be.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE, &s;ir, a &s;ufficiency has been &s;aid, if not to give you an adequately full idea of the &s;ufferings of poor Bo&s;|ton, yet &s;uch a conception of them as will excite your wonder, and heighten your feelings of compa&s;&s;ion towards us. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since penning the above, there has been bro't into event, of which we had not the lea&s;t imagination, and which I cannot re&s;train my&s;elf from mentioning to you. It is this. Our ve&s;&s;els with wood, which, by the Bo&s;ton port-bill, are obliged to put in at Marble|head, to be enabled by the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e at Salem to proceed to Bo&s;ton harbor, are denied this privilege, till the wood that is in them has been taken out, and then put in again, which occa&s;ions not only expen&s;ive labor, but tedious delay; as there are few landing pla|ces in Marblehead, and con&s;iderable number of ve&s;&s;els in the harbor there at the &s;ame time, which mu&s;t wait till they have opportunity to unload, and then load again. The pa&s;|&s;age of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els to Bo&s;ton is hereby al|ways lengthened, and they are &s;ometimes detained longer than they need have been, by being expo&s;ed to contrary winds. Be&s;ides all which, the&s;e &s;ame ve&s;&s;els, when they are come to Bo&s;ton, are not &s;uffered to depart from thence, till the owner's of them, or others in their behalf, have travelled to Plymouth, which is more than forty miles, and have vi&s;ited the Bo&s;ton cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, which is now removed there. The&s;e ob&s;tructions have increa&s;ed the price of fewel nearly one third part, which mu&s;t be cruelly de&s;tre&s;&s;|ing to the people here, in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of our provi&s;ion-ve&s;&s;els. They mu&s;t all go to Mar|blehead; and then they are obliged to be unloaded and then loaded, before they can be permitted to come to Bo&s;ton; nor can they go out of that harbor, without a per|mi&s;&s;ion from Plymouth, more then forty miles di&s;tant. Whether this extraordinary bur|den, upon articles without which we cannot live, is to be a&s;cribed to the late parliamen|tary act, or the commi&s;&s;ioners, who now re|&s;ide at Salem, you may ea&s;ily &s;atisfy your&s;elf by only reading the act it&s;elf. It is the ge|neral opinion, that the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, had they the feelings of humanity, would not have put a con&s;truction upon the port bill, &s;o far exceeding in rigor what it will bear in con&s;i&s;tency with common &s;en&s;e. But what may not be expected from men, who, ever &s;ince they have been in office, have done all in their power to render them&s;elves odious to the people, and le&s;s &s;erviceable to his Maje&s;ty, than they might otherwi&s;e have been.</NOTE> But I will not enlarge, lea&s;t your

wrath &s;hould be provoked, and &s;uch re|&s;entment enkindled in you, as could not ea&s;ily be kept under due re&s;traint.</P>
<P>INSTEAD, of this, I will endeavor to calm your pa&s;&s;ions, and mitigate your &s;en&s;ations of pain on our account, by &s;howing you, wherein this parliament|ary act, however unintended by the contrivers of it, is powerfully adapted to promote the intere&s;t of all the Ame|rican colonies, and of even Bo&s;ton it|&s;elf in the end.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="013197_0023_0F9045E364548980">THE de&s;ign of the Briti&s;h admini|&s;tration, with re&s;pect, not only to this town and province, but all the colo|nies on the continent, is &s;o obviou&s;ly vi&s;ible by this act of parliament, that no one can ea&s;ily be at a lo&s;s to know, that it is to oblige America, by the iron hand of power, to &s;ubmit to &s;overeign plea&s;ure. This is accordingly the uni|ver&s;al &s;entiment of all ranks, orders, and conditions of men from one end of the continent to the other. Even tho&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="013197_0024_0F9045E38B65FFD0">
who have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by being called the friends of government, are now fully &s;atisfied, that the plan to be carried into execution, and by forcible mea&s;ures, is, intire obedience to the de|mands of de&s;poti&s;m, in&s;tead of tho&s;e con&s;titutional laws we are perfectly willing to be governed by. It may rea&s;onably be e&s;teemed an advantage, and a very important one, to be thus indi&s;putably let into the knowledge of this; as, by knowing that forcing from us our rights and privileges as Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, is the grand point in view, we &s;hall naturally be urged on to contrive expedients to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, our being in this way, brought into bon|dage: Or, &s;hould no expedients be effectual to this end, power being on the &s;ide of oppre&s;&s;ion, we may &s;olace our&s;elves with the thought, that we acted like men, and will re&s;olutely en|deavor, under the influence of this con|&s;ideration, to prepare our minds to bear, in the ea&s;ie&s;t manner, the great|e&s;t of all outward evils, &s;ubjection to arbitrary plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="013197_0025_0F9045E459507418">THIS act, though more immediate|ly relative to Bo&s;ton, and the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ett's-province, is an alarm to all the North American colonies; loudly &s;ounding it in their ears, that they may &s;urely expect, each one in their turn, as occa&s;ion offers, like treatment with that we have met with. For the de&s;ign intended to be carried into effect, is not confined to a &s;ingle town, or province, but extends to the whole American continent. What has been done, with re&s;pect to Bo&s;ton, and the province to which it belongs, is the beginning only of &s;orrow, unle&s;s prevented in one pru|dent way or another, and an example held out, in terrorem, to the other colo|nies. And &s;hould Bo&s;ton, and the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts's-province, be brought into a &s;tate of &s;lavery by the hand of power, every other town and colony on the continent would unavoidably, in a lit|tle time, be placed in like circum&s;tan|ces. This is the voice of the late par|liamentary proceedure, and as evident|ly &s;o as if promulged in the mo&s;t plain|ly
<PB N="27" REF="013197_0026_0F9045EA6D081F38">
articulated words. And this, accord|ing to the accounts we have received, is the interpretation the colonies put upon it. They e&s;teem them&s;elves as truly, though not &s;o immediately, &s;truck at, as either Bo&s;ton, or the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;ett's-province. For, as they ju&s;t|ly ob&s;erve, the cau&s;e in which we &s;uf|fer is a common one, their's as well as our's; and whatever our fate is, the &s;ame will be their's al&s;o. If now the Ame|rican colonies &s;hould be influenced, by this amazingly cruel act, to unite as one is projecting, and carrying into exe|cution, expedients rea&s;onable in them|&s;elves, and wi&s;ely adapted to &s;ecure the enjoyments of their rights and privi|leges, and to promote, at the &s;ame time, harmony and love between Great-Bri|tain and America, it would mo&s;t cer|tainly be for the common intere&s;t of all, yea, even of Bo&s;ton, that this &s;hocking decree has been i&s;&s;ued forth, though their &s;ufferings, by rea&s;on of it, will be awfully &s;evere. And it is, I may add here, unque&s;tionably true, that the co|lonies
<PB N="28" REF="013197_0027_0F9045EE02B60BC8">
will, by means of this parlia|mentary conduct, be more firmly unit|ed than ever; yea, that they will all act in concert, as if they were one, in exerting them&s;elves in all wi&s;e and po&s;|&s;ible ways to fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of tho&s;e who would rule them with a rod of iron, in&s;tead of the laws of con&s;titu|tional government. Many here, as well as at home, would not &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be &s;uch an union of the colonies; but this is now made to appear by their choice of deputies to meet in congre&s;s to con&s;ult mea&s;ures for the common good of them all, and particularly for the relief of Bo&s;ton, as it is now &s;uffering, not for it's own &s;ake only, but for their's al&s;o.</P>
<P>AS the port of Bo&s;ton has been the principal inlet in this part of America, to that inundation of Briti&s;h goods, which have occa&s;ioned the &s;preading of extravagances, beyond de&s;cription in every kind, not only through this town, but the whole province, it might
<PB N="29" REF="013197_0028_0F9045EEDCFC9010">
be the de&s;ign of Heaven, though not thought of by men, to te&s;tify again&s;t the ineffable folly of all &s;orts of per&s;ons, whether of higher or lower rank, in parting with the fruits of their labor, or the income of their e&s;tates, for im|ported articles, which are of no &s;ervice unle&s;s to gratify pride, and &s;ooth a vain mind; and to give, at the &s;ame time, this folly of their's a &s;olemn check. which, if not re&s;trained, will be the ruin of the country. It would argue wi&s;|dom in people, and powerfully tend to promote their INTEREST, if they would look upon them&s;elves as NOW taught in providence, and loudly called upon, to refrain from purcha&s;ing that merchan|dize, which &s;wallows up their &s;ub&s;tance for the paultry con&s;ideration only of appearing in finery of dre&s;s which ill becomes them. A non-con&s;umption of Engli&s;h goods, in tho&s;e articles wherein they may do as well without, as with them, to every purpo&s;e excepting that of ornamental vanity, would with|out controver&s;y, be highly beneficial,
<PB N="30" REF="013197_0029_0F9045F04E5B3B60">
not only to this town and province, but to all the towns in all the colonies; and it might happily tend to bring us relief in this day of darkne&s;s and di&s;|tre&s;s. It would be no wonder, if &s;ome importers from England, who&s;e views are &s;olely confined to &s;elf, &s;hould ex|claim again&s;t &s;uch a mea&s;ure, and exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t to prevent it's taking place; as their gain might here|by be le&s;&s;ened. This is no other than may be expected of tho&s;e in trade; who&s;e contracted minds re&s;trains them from all public genero&s;ity. But is it not better that the&s;e individuals &s;hould &s;uffer, than that this &s;hould be the ca&s;e of the whole country, who, by means of what they import, are influenced, by a kind of fa&s;cination, to part with their earnings to their great hurt, in|&s;tead of profit. It is readily acknow|ledged, that trade, wi&s;ely conducted, is the &s;ure&s;t method to enrich and ag|grandize a people; but it is a great mi&s;take to imagine, that it will, carried on in any way, be productive of this
<PB N="31" REF="013197_0030_0F9045F1087AB720">
effect. And it may be laid down as an indubitable truth, that trade, in&s;tead of promoting this good, will powerfully tend to do mi&s;chief to a people, con&s;i|dered as &s;uch, however it may &s;erve &s;ome individuals, if it is &s;o managed, as that, upon the whole, they are im|poveri&s;hed by means of it. This, for a cour&s;e of years, has been the re&s;ult of our trade as carried on with Great-Bri|tain. Such have been the needle&s;s im|ports from thence, and &s;uch the folly of people in their extravagant u&s;e of them, that a very great part of the fruit of our labor and toil, and of our trade to fo|reign parts, has been remitted home for that which has been rather ruinous, than profitable to us! It may, without ex|aggeration, be &s;aid, that &s;ome millions a year &s;terling have been &s;ent from the colonies to England, in return for goods imported from thence, which we did not want, and which could not, in any wi&s;e view, be con&s;idered as pro|motive of benefit to us. Need the peo|ple now be told, that it would be for
<PB N="32" REF="013197_0031_0F9045F1B8F0D7E0">
their intere&s;t, un&s;peakably &s;o, to put the&s;e millions &s;terling into their own pockets which are annually &s;ent home in payment for what they might as well, yea much better, have done with|out? They mu&s;t be under a degree of infatuation not to &s;ee this to be the height of folly, even to madne&s;s. Let the importers of a mon&s;trous &s;uperfluity of Engli&s;h goods turn the cour&s;e of their trade, at lea&s;t &s;o manage it as may &s;erve the public, and not them&s;elves only, and they will then merit both honor and encouragement: But they will have no ju&s;t rea&s;on for complaint, if they are e&s;teemed poor mercenary wretches, while, for their own private gain, they are vehemently clamorous in oppo&s;ing all rea&s;onable methods &s;o far to put a &s;top to Engli&s;h imports, as they are certainly hurtful to the country, and in an high degree. Our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances loudly call for this, and that which will naturally follow upon it, a retrenchment of our unparralleled extravagance. And &s;hould the colonies
<PB N="33" REF="013197_0032_0F9045F285B4BD38">
take occa&s;ion from what has been done to Bo&s;ton (a &s;triking &s;pecimen of what they may expect will be done to them, at one time or other) to live more with|in them&s;elves, and to con&s;ume no Eng|li&s;h goods, but what their convenience, I will not &s;ay nece&s;&s;ity, calls for, we &s;hould probably &s;oon find an end put to the grievances we have long complained of, but &s;till lie groaning under. Per|haps, the people in England would feel it di&s;advantageous to them, &s;hould the people in America agree upon a non-con&s;umption of Briti&s;h goods, within &s;uch limits as a due regard to their own intere&s;t makes nece&s;&s;ary; but they could not rea&s;onably find fault with &s;uch a mea&s;ure, and, in&s;tead if doing &s;o, they might co-operate with us, in endeavoring the re&s;toration, and fu|ture &s;ecure enjoyment, of tho&s;e civil rights and privileges we have been de|prived of, by the hand of power. And &s;hould we, by their interpo&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, be placed in the&s;e happy cir|cum&s;tances, &s;uch would be our affecti|on
<PB N="34" REF="013197_0033_0F9045F354A42A18">
towards them, as that we &s;hould chearfully forego our own advantage in trade, &s;o far as might in rea&s;on be expected, in order to promote their's. Be this as it may, by &s;uch a mea&s;ure, carried into execution, we &s;hould na|turally be put upon greater frugality than we have commonly been u&s;ed to, a more enlarged cultivation of our lands and the &s;etting up manufactures a|mong our&s;elves in every kind, wherein they may be &s;erviceable to us; the effect whereof would be the retaining monies in our own pur&s;es, which would be more than an hundred-fold com|pen&s;ation for what is uncon&s;titution|ally wre&s;ted from us; at lea&s;t we &s;hould have that within our&s;elves, which would enable us to wait without &s;trife and contention, till the almighty righteous ruler of the world &s;hall work out &s;al|vation for us; which we firmly believe he will, in one way or another, &s;ooner or later.</P>
