<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONVERSION OF AN <HI>INDIAN,</HI> IN A LETTER TO A FRIEND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR DRUROW</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have been my con&s;tant friend for many years, and have &s;ome knowledge of the Engli&s;h tongue, I, in return of friend&s;hip, intend giving you &s;ome account of my travels and experience &s;ince I left Maryland.</P>
<P>I very fortunately met with captain S&mdash;, bound for London, and agreed with him for my pa&s;&s;age; the next day I went on board, at which time the captain was giving orders to his men to get every thing in readine&s;s for the fir&s;t fair wind. They had all their cargo on board, and wi&s;hed for nothing more than a &s;peedy departure. I &s;pent that night a very re&s;tle&s;s manner, my mind being filled with &s;orrow at the thoughts of leaving my friends and native country.</P>
<P>The next morning the wind-came about, and &s;tood W. by N. at which joy appeared in every countenance, except my own. They weighed an|chor, and hoi&s;ted &s;ail with the greate&s;t expedition &mdash;at which time tongue could not expre&s;s the dif|ferent emotions of my heart: &s;warms of thoughts, like the&s;e, poured in upon me; "I mu&s;t now take
<PB N="4" REF="028801_0004_0FDD4D491E5F0E10">
my leave of every thing that is dear to me; I may perhaps be drowned in the &s;ea, or die in my pa&s;|&s;age, and never &s;ee my friends and native country any more." In an&s;wer to this, it returned upon my mind, Tho&s;e I have left behind do not want for any thing; and for my part, I have plenty, and &s;hall be independent till I &s;ee my deare&s;t friends again. I &s;hall be re&s;pected by our prince, for the di&s;coveries I may make in matters acted among the chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>But this my friend, was uppermo&s;t in my mind, to inquire who their God was, how they wor&s;hip him; for you know, our father intirely forbade our Engli&s;h tutor even to &s;peak of him in our hear|ing. Upon the&s;e con&s;iderations I was re&s;olved to bani&s;h all thoughts that had tended to make me unea&s;y, as I did not conceive why a per&s;on of my &s;phere &s;hould indulge that &s;oftne&s;s too much practi|&s;ed among our women. Curio&s;ity now reared its head, and bore the &s;ceptre with maje&s;ty. I once more ca&s;t my eyes on my native land by way of gratitude, and then took my leave, intreating Da|rus, my father's God, to be my protector, and bring me back, when he thought fit.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of our &s;ailors were di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the name of chri&s;tians; but my friend, I was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed when I came upon deck. They called upon their God, it is true, but in that noi&s;y, blu&s;tering, confu&s;ed manner, as if each feared the roaring of the waves intercepted his addre&s;&s;es. I thought within my&s;elf, their god mu&s;t be but a mean god indeed, if he pays any regard to their wild way of wor&s;hip: but at la&s;t I under&s;tood that all their behaviour was an abu&s;e of his goodne&s;s, and &s;prung merely from a di&s;order in them&s;elves; for they wanted nothing which per&s;ons in their &s;ituations could wi&s;h for, and yet, in the mid&s;t of plenty, there was not the lea&s;t appearance of thankfulne&s;s. In working the &s;hip they often called upon God to damn their eyes, their hands, their feet, &amp; their blood, in &s;hort they were more mad with
<PB N="5" REF="028801_0005_0FDD4D4C89BF2DA0">
rage than our Indian &s;oldiers when clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed by the enemy in the field of battle; and &s;eeing he did not de&s;troy their members, when often intreat|ed to do &s;o, I concluded their god was deaf, or el&s;e &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate that be pitied and &s;pared them for his own goodne&s;s &s;ake.</P>
<P>By attending to their behaviour farther, I found they had another god, with whom they had a grea|ter intimacy; he did not appear at that di&s;tance from them that the former did; and &s;ome of them I may &s;ay indeed the greater part of them, expre&s;|&s;ed a de&s;ire to dwell with him, for they would of|ten call upon him to come and take them. This, my friend, was the fir&s;t time I di&s;covered that the peo|ple called chri&s;tians had two gods.</P>
<P>Within five weeks we made the &s;outh-we&s;t of Ireland. Our captain had &s;ome thoughts of put|ting in at one of their &s;ea ports, to take in fre&s;h water, but the wind being fair, and a &s;mart &s;ea breeze, we re&s;olved to pur&s;ue our cour&s;e. The next day we made the lands of England, at the &s;ight of which, the &s;ailors were elated with joy. In three days after we arrived &s;afe in in the Downs, where we dropped anchor. I returned thanks to Darus, that he had been mindful of us on the &s;ea, and &s;aved us from the power of the raging waves. After I had paid my pa&s;&s;age, and given orders con|cerning my things on board, I went in the boat with the captain, and that night arrived at Lon|don.</P>
<P>I put up at an inn, and promi&s;ed my&s;elf great plea&s;ure by being in the chri&s;tians' capital. I confe&s;s, my friend, I was greatly &s;urprized to &s;ee the largene&s;s of the place, and multitude of inha|bitants: but the&s;e &s;maller matters I &s;hall pa&s;s over till I &s;ee you; my chief bu&s;ine&s;s is, to find out the God who is &s;uppo&s;ed to dwell among the chri&s;ti|ans, and the manner of their wor&s;hip. Accord|ingly, the next &s;abbath day (for you mu&s;t know, my friend, in this chri&s;tian nation they &s;et apart one day from &s;even, for the wor&s;hip of what they call
<PB N="6" REF="028801_0006_0FDD4D4D70BEE990">
the true God, and retire from all worldly employs on one of tho&s;e days) I went with a guide to a place called a church, at the entrance of which I was a little &s;urprized at the largene&s;s of the company.</P>
<P>I followed my ho&s;t till he came to the middle of the place, when I &s;aw a tall man covered with a long white garment, from his &s;houlders down to his feet; and, with an audible voice, he read in a large book that lay open before him. Many of the peo|ple in the place had a &s;mall book in their hands, and &s;ometimes they read aloud, in an&s;wer to the man in the white garment; at other times he and they &s;poke loud together. After this, the tall man put off the long white covering, and then from his &s;houlders down he was blacker than any of us In|dians, Then he a&s;cended &s;everal &s;teps, and had a &s;mall book in his hand, and, as I thought, called upon their God; but in a &s;low, faint, dull manner, quite different from the manner of the chri&s;tian &s;ailors. I took particular notice of the a&s;&s;embly, &s;ome of them &s;tood, others &s;at, and a few were on their knees. In &s;hort, I no longer wondered at chri&s;tians having two gods; for when I ob&s;erved their different po&s;itions, I was ready to imagine they had near as many gods as they were people; as the different po&s;ition of the body &s;hewed differ|ent frames of their minds.</P>
<P>Then the man in black made a long pau&s;e. He again took the book into his hand, for it appeared to me the book was his whole &s;upport, and read the&s;e words:&mdash;"What is required of thee, O man, but to do ju&s;tly, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God?" He told them, in the fir&s;t place, it was every man's duty to endeavour for the nece&s;|&s;aries of life, in an hone&s;t manner; that it was incon&s;i&s;tent with the chri&s;tian's plan for any man to defraud his neighbour; and, in the &s;econd place, provided they had more than &s;ufficient for them|&s;elves, it was the &s;tronge&s;t proof of their being un|doubted chri&s;tians, and lovers of mercy, &s;aid he, to deal your bread to the hungry, to cover the na|ked
<PB N="7" REF="028801_0007_0FDD4D4F1C4FE8D8">
with a garment, as acts of charity and bene|volence are mo&s;t plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of God: and, in the third place, to walk humbly with thy God.</P>
<P>He told them that man was formed out of the du&s;t, and ere long mu&s;t return to the du&s;t again; and added, Thoughts of this kind &s;hould reduce you to a proper knowledge of your&s;elves, and the fruit of it &s;hould appear by a con&s;tant attendance upon the means of grace. When on a dying bed, it will be a comfortable &s;upport to your feeble mind, to look back on a well-&s;pent life; &s;uch per|&s;ons, doubtle&s;s, God will not di&s;approve of in the great day, but will welcome them with a "Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."</P>
<P>Mean time I could not help taking notice of the behaviour of the company a&s;&s;embled together, &s;ome of them were whi&s;pering, others &s;leeping, and and abundance looking at each other, as if they were admiring the different colours of their cloaths, or the manner of their dre&s;s; quite regardle&s;s of what the man in black was &s;peaking, or at lea&s;t it appeared &s;o to me. After he had done reading in his little book, he came down, and all the peo|ple went out of the place, many of them walked into the &s;ame &s;treet where I lodged. So I attended to their behaviour, while pa&s;&s;ing, &s;ome were talk|ing about the news-papers, informing each other how bu&s;ine&s;s was carried on abroad; in &s;hort, they were all bu&s;y about the affairs of this life; but not a word did I hear about the &s;ermon, or the God the man &s;poke of, unle&s;s in a trifling, profane man|ner. I was not at all plea&s;ed either with the per|formance of the man that &s;poke, or the behaviour of the people, for the former did not tell them who God was, where he was, or how they &s;hould find him; and the latter were all confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>When I came to my lodgings, my mind was ex|ceedingly unea&s;y; I rung the bell, and the landlord came to know what I wanted. I told him, a pro|per knowledge of the chri&s;tian's God: at which
<PB N="8" REF="028801_0008_0FDD4D535A9CC268">
he appeared greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, and declared he was no &s;cholar, therefore he was not a proper per&s;on to give any information. I then a&s;ked him, whether he knew of any one in the neighbourhood that could. He told me, there was one Dr. T&mdash;r. a few doors from him, &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of the greate&s;t &s;cholars in the city. The next morning I waited upon this gentleman; and he received me with all the civility imaginable. I a&s;ked pardon for the freedom I had taken, and de&s;ired he would not be &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;trangene&s;s of my bu&s;ine&s;s: I then told him I was an Indian, born in the pro|vince of New-York, and the chief of my bu&s;ine&s;s, in this place, was, in que&s;t of the chri&s;tian's God. After a long pau&s;e, he made this an&s;wer: Your bu&s;ine&s;s, Sir, is of the greate&s;t importance; and to give you proper directions, is of equal moment, and requires &s;ome time for deliberation, If you plea&s;e to call upon me to-morrow morning, I &s;hall be glad to &s;pend an hour or two with you. I did &s;o; but the good Doctor de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, and told me, &s;ome unexpected bu&s;ine&s;s had fallen in his way, that required his attendance for &s;eve|ral days; and added, if you &s;tay in town till the latter end of next week, I &s;hall be exceedingly glad to &s;ee you, and give you all the information I am capable of. I thanked him, and &s;o we parted. By this time, my friend, I was ready to wi&s;h my&s;elf in my native land again, and repented my being &s;o trouble&s;ome to my&s;elf and others. But one day, as I was &s;tanding in the pa&s;&s;age from my room to the kitchen, I &s;aw in a dark place the end of a large book it was almo&s;t buried in lumber and dirt. I a&s;ked the maid what book it was. I do not know indeed &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he, unle&s;s it is an old bible put there out of the way. She took it into her hands, and opened the cover; It is, &s;aid &s;he, &s;ure enough. Good now, we have no time to read in any good book in this place. Pray &s;aid I, is that a book the chri&s;tians pay any regard to? It is, &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he&mdash; I have often heard my mother &s;ay that every one
<PB N="9" REF="028801_0009_0FDD4D5432E24690">
is a good chri&s;tian who follows the directions giv|en in that book. I then de&s;ired her to take it to the kitchen, to wipe off the du&s;t, and bring it to my room. I was never better plea&s;ed, than when I found it to be the chri&s;tians rule re&s;pecting doct|rine and practice. I re&s;olved to read it over and over again, and then compare the manners of the chri&s;tians with what was contained in this book.&mdash; I &s;pent near three weeks in the reading and &s;tudy of it, and found it the mo&s;t plea&s;ing piece I ever met with; for though I had read over &s;ome part of it &s;everal times, the matter was &s;till new. I com|pared it to a fountain, of which every pa&s;&s;enger may freely drink, yet it is &s;till overflowing.</P>
<P>In this book, there is an account that God is a &s;pirit, &s;elf-exi&s;ting before all worlds, from eternity to eternity having neither beginning nor end that eve+ry good thing either dwells in or proceeds from him. It was he that made the &s;un, moon and &s;tars, the earth and &s;ea, and all that therein is: it was he that formed man out of the du&s;t, and gave him an immortal &s;oul that will exi&s;t parrallel with him&s;elf. I confe&s;s, my friend, the reading of this book had &s;uch an effect upon my mind, as I never felt before. It treated of the fall of man in his parent Adam, together with the numberle&s;s evils entailed upon his po&s;terity in con&s;equence of the fall; and that tho&s;e things not only con&s;ume the body, and tor|ment the mind in this life; but it further a&s;&s;erts, that without pardon here, divine vengeance will be poured on the heads of the guilty through all eternity.</P>
<P>I began to tremble, and the tears gu&s;hed from my eyes in abundance. I laid the book a&s;ide, and began to &s;ummon all my rea&s;on to the field, if po&s;|&s;ible to &s;ubdue or make a &s;tand again&s;t the confu&s;ion I was in; but all I could do, was not &s;ufficient to &s;top the rapidity of my thoughts. They recoiled upon me, that Adam was the father of all the hu|man race; Adam di&s;obeyed the command of his God; upon this di&s;obedience, his glory left him,
<PB N="10" REF="028801_0010_0FDD4D56060C9968">
and the cur&s;e took place. I am one of his unhappy offspring: I never knew any thing of pardon, there|fore the cur&s;e remains upon me. Upon this con|clu&s;ion, nature was con&s;trained to melt under a &s;upernatural power; I could no more re&s;train my tears, than I could &s;top the cour&s;e of the &s;un, or with my word re&s;tain the flowing of the tide.</P>
<P>While in this dejected, mi&s;erable condition, di|vers pa&s;&s;ages I had read were thundering upon my mind, &s;uch as the&s;e: "We have all &s;inned, and come &s;hort of the glory of God: the cur&s;e of the Lord is in the hou&s;e of the wicked: God is angry with the wicked every day: There is no peace to the wicked, &s;aith my God: The wicked &s;hall be turned into hell," &amp;c. The&s;e, put together, were as the ruin of a dreadful breach cru&s;hing the poor per&s;on in chains. In this melancholy conditi|on I continued &s;everal days; but one evening, while I was mu&s;ing on the&s;e things: it was &s;trongly &s;ug|ge&s;ted to my mind, "May not the matter contain|ed in this book be fal&s;e? Are there not many from the pre&s;s that wholly dwell upon &s;uppo&s;ition? others without a &s;ingle probability for their &s;up|port? and if this is the ca&s;e, my pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s is without foundation," I took the book into my hand with a de&s;ign, if po&s;&s;ible, to find out the fallacy, and attended to the matter I read with all the powers of my mind; but within twenty minutes reading I was perfectly &s;atisfied this book was found|ed upon the Rock of ages; for it not only militated again&s;t the practices of the children of men, but Likewi&s;e the words of their lips; de&s;cribed and expo&s;ed the abominable thoughts of the heart. I can truly &s;ay, it traced me from my childhood to mature age, and from that time to this, abundantly more perfectly than I could, if I had kept a journal of my whole life; and when I turned my eyes on my poor fellow-&s;inners, I &s;aw them painted to the life as completely as my&s;elf; for although they are di&s;tingui&s;hed as far as I can learn, they have no more regard to the reality of this book, than our
<PB N="11" REF="028801_0011_0FDD4D5A43A87660">
poor &s;laves, who have never heard of its being in the world. Re&s;pecting their manners, they are as vicious as any people I ever was among. I have ta|ken &s;ome pains to travel thro' every part of the town; but, alas! I unhappily found every &s;treet a &s;tanding proof of the cur&s;e levelled upon Adam's rebellious race. There I heard tho&s;e called chri&s;ti|ans bla&s;pheme the name of God, and loudly call upon him for damnation; others, intoxicated with liquor, were obliged to roll in the dirt, &s;hamele&s;s as the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h; &s;ome fighting till the blood &s;treamed to the ground. When I returned to my lodgings, I began to reflect on the&s;e malancholy &s;cenes; I opened the chri&s;tian's book, and found the&s;e words: "This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, but men love dark|ne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds are evil." I opened it again, and fixed my eyes on this pa&s;|&s;age, "Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to de&s;truction, and many there are which go in thereat."</P>
<P>This, my friend, is the melancholy &s;tate of the in|habitants of this land, and I fear of mo&s;t other pla|ces: I went to one of their churches &s;everal times, but &s;eeing the behaviour of the people &s;o incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the whole tenor of their book, I could look on it as little better than a &s;olemn mockery of God; but the la&s;t time I was there I took a par|ticular notice of one of the people who &s;at near me: he appeared to be in great di&s;tre&s;s of mind, he leaned with his head upon his hand, and his eyes were fixed on the ground, from whence tears flow|ed in abundance: it affected me &s;o much the more, as I had laboured under much trouble from the time of my reading the chri&s;tian's book; and it was &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon my mind, to inquire into the cau&s;e of his tears.</P>
<P>After &s;ervice was ended, I &s;poke to the man in the tendere&s;t manner I was capable of; I de&s;ired he would excu&s;e the freedom of a &s;tranger, adding, I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> his deportment in the church different
<PB N="12" REF="028801_0012_0FDD4D5BB9DE58A8">
from all the re&s;t; and, if it was a fair que&s;tion, &s;hould be glad to know the cau&s;e. In an&s;wer to this, he told me, he made no &s;ecret of his pre&s;ent mi&s;ery; that it did not ari&s;e from the want or ab|&s;ence of any earthly good; but that the ab&s;ence of God was the cau&s;e of all his troubles: "I have la|boured, &s;aid he, under the burden of a guilty con|&s;cience, and God only knows where it will end."&mdash; By this time we were retired from the confu&s;ed noi&s;e of pa&s;&s;engers, to a place more proper for conver&s;ing freely with a friend. His la&s;t words, "the burden of a guilty con&s;cience, and his fear|ing it would never end," affected my mind much: I de&s;ired him to explain him&s;elf, a&s;&s;uring him, that I had no other motive than a proper information in the particulars before hnted: that I was a &s;tranger in this land, and the chief of my bu&s;ine&s;s was in que&s;t of the chri&s;tians' God; and told him, that all my endeavours had hitherto been fruitle&s;s, except the information given me in the bible, which great|ly alarmed my mind; but I did not under&s;tand it as I could wi&s;h, and I wanted &s;omebody to explain it. He an&s;wered, "For my part, I am both un|worthy and unfit for the arduous ta&s;k; but if you plea&s;e to take a walk with me this evening, you &s;hall hear &s;ome part of it opened and explained in a profitable manner." I con&s;ented &s;o to do. But pray, &s;aid I what is it you mean by the burden of a guilty con&s;cience? At which tears &s;tood in his eyes, and he thus began:</P>
<P>"Sixteen years ago, God was plea&s;ed to open the eyes of my under&s;tanding by the preaching of the go&s;pel: I &s;aw my&s;elf a lo&s;t, undone &s;inner, with|out Chri&s;t; I was &s;en&s;ible that all the flood gates of divine ju&s;tice were ready to bur&s;t upon my guilty head, for my numbere&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the King of Kings." Pray &s;aid I, is the wrath of God upon all mankind? upon this, and all other nati|ons: &s;aid he, "We are all by nature children of wrath, until rai&s;ed by the Friend of &s;inners from a &s;piritual death to a &s;piritual life; for the
<PB N="13" REF="028801_0013_0FDD4D600799FFC8">
word of God &s;aith, "He that believeth not on the Son, hath not life, but the wrath of God abideth on him." Pray, &s;aid I, who is this Friend of &s;in|ners you &s;peak of? At which que&s;tion tears &s;tood in his eyes: "It is Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;aviour of the world (he replied), who died upon the cro&s;s that all who truly believe in him, might not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life." I was de&s;irous to hear more of this, but he de&s;ired to return to a recital of pa&s;t experience. "When God, &s;aid he, in the riches of his grace, was plea&s;ed to illuminate my under|&s;tanding, to inform my judgment, and convert my con&s;cience, I cried to the Lord for mercy, and he was plea&s;ed to lend a gracious ear to my &s;uppli|cations, &s;o that in a &s;hort time I had a clear conviction of my acceptance in the Beloved. I knew that God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, had pardoned all my &s;ins, and embraced me in his tender arms: for &s;ome time I walked in the light of his counte|nance, and trampled beneath my feet the enemies of my &s;oul. Oh the happy hours and days that I have enjoyed in &s;weet communion with my God!" He then bur&s;t into tears again: "How doth the remembrance of the&s;e things &s;tab my &s;oul! I fear the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed opportunities are gone for ever; gone from me; I have bani&s;hed my&s;elf far from every good; that eternal Sun, which once &s;hone upon my &s;oul, is now departed, and left me in the dar|ke&s;t &s;hades of night." As &s;oon as he was able to hear my words, I a&s;ked him what was the in&s;tru|ment of his fall? "Oh! Sir, &s;aid he, there are more in&s;truments for our hurt, than there are &s;tars in the heavens, or than drops in the ocean." But, &s;aid I, what do you &s;uppo&s;e to be the fir&s;t in&s;trument? "My fir&s;t fall, &s;aid he, was unfaithfulne&s;s; this led me to the neglect of pri|vate prayer; quickly after came upon me a trifling &s;pirit; then a &s;warm of fooli&s;h thoughts and evil de&s;ires poured in, like the plagues of Egypt&middot; Thus
<PB N="14" REF="028801_0014_0FDD4D60F0E26F50">
I fell from one thing to another, not without a thou&s;and &s;tripes of con&s;cience, while I was falling; &s;o that at pre&s;ent I am &s;atisfied I have only one &s;tep more, that is, from time, into all the mi&s;eries of eternity.' But, &s;aid I, can you contrive no means whereby you may appea&s;e the wrath of God?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e you endeavour, for the future, to follow all the directions given you in the chri&s;tians' book Is it not po&s;&s;ible to regain that happine&s;s you once enjoyed? "It is as impo&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, to regain it in point of de&s;ert or merit, as it is to pluck the &s;un from the firmament, or di&s;&s;olve and make the earth anew: no, my heart, like a corrupt fountain, is poi&s;oned, and can never &s;end forth healing &s;treams: every channel of my &s;oul, with every member of my body, is defiled by &s;in; &s;o that from the crown of the head, to the &s;ole of the foot, there is not one &s;ound place, but wounds and brui&s;es, and putrify|ing &s;ores." For my part, I could &s;ay no more on that head, for I felt the experimental part in my&s;elf, and remember to have read the &s;ame words in the chri&s;tians' book. I think I never &s;aw a poor crea|ture in greater di&s;tre&s;s of mind; and, for my part, I was little better for the recital of his misfortunes, which rai&s;ed in me a deep &s;en&s;e of my mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>When we came to the place where he had pro|mi&s;ed I &s;hould hear the word of God preached in a profitable manner, there was a large company a&s;|&s;embled together. I was greatly plea&s;ed with the behavour of the multitude; for, except at the door, &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s &s;at on every countenance, as if conver|&s;ing with their own hearts. Soon after this, I &s;aw a plain looking man pa&s;s through the crowd, and a&s;cend a few &s;teps above the people: he lifted up his eyes as though his heart was &s;trongly engaged with God; then he &s;tood up, and with an audible voice he gave out the&s;e words:
<Q><L>"Come &s;inners, to the go&s;pel fea&s;t!</L>
<L>Let every &s;oul be Je&s;u's gue&s;t."</L></Q>
Hundreds of the people, both men and woman, &s;ang in prai&s;e to their God. Indeed, my friend, I
<PB N="15" REF="028801_0015_0FDD4D65D689A740">
was never more tran&s;ported with mu&s;ic than at that time with the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s that &s;at on every coun|tenance: the awfulne&s;s of the place, and the warmth that was in their devotion, all con&s;pired to charm the human mind.</P>
<P>After this he &s;aid, Let us pray. In the former part of which he made an humble confe&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins to God and at the end of every &s;entence there was a &s;olemn groan: this was done by the whole crowd, as if &s;truggling for a deliverance from the enemies of their &s;ouls. He then intreated God's mercy, for the &s;ake of his Son, to de&s;cend on every heart, and the people clo&s;ed his petetions with a loud Amen, as wre&s;tling for the ble&s;&s;ings their &s;ouls panted after. I &s;uppo&s;e, my friend, in ten minutes time there where thou&s;ands of tears &s;hed; and, for my part I was &s;o agitated, as if my &s;oul were leaving its hou&s;e of clay. It was for &s;ome time before I could compo&s;e my&s;elf. The mini&s;ter, after prayer, made a long pau&s;e; he then &s;aid, In the fourth chapter of Amos and twelfth ver&s;e, were the&s;e words, "Prepare to meet thy God." He re|peated &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages to the &s;ame effect: when he opened the words of text, he told us, in the fir&s;t place, that man by nature was altogether unprepar|ed to meet his God either in death or judgment; being out of Chri&s;t, God was a con&s;uming fire. In the &s;econd place, he told what was implied in a go&s;|pel preparation. Under this head, as a wi&s;e ma&s;ter builder, he laid the glorious foundation, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the rock of ages: that what he had done and &s;uf|fered, had made a complete &s;atisfaction to all the demands of divine ju&s;tice, and rendered the Father attentive to the feeble prayers of poor &s;inners, that we might come with boldne&s;s to the throne of grace, and obtain grace and mercy to help in time of need; that Chri&s;t was the foundation on which we might build our happine&s;s in time and through eternity; and though man had no power in him&s;elf to help him&s;elf; he had given his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit to rou&s;e the &s;leepy con&s;cience of &s;inners, and rai&s;e the dead to
<PB N="16" REF="028801_0016_0FDD4D66F0FDC750">
life. To be prepared, &s;aid he, is to repent, to for|&s;ake every known &s;in, to believe with the heart un|to righteou&s;ne&s;s; to receive Chri&s;t in all his offices, and to pre&s;s after holine&s;s, without which no man can &s;ee the Lord. In the third place, he &s;hewed the difference, con&s;equences and mi&s;ery, of all tho&s;e that neglect a preparation; they may expect nothing but the phials of the wrath of God upon their guil|ty heads whil&s;t eternal ages roll on: and on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide, that the righteous &s;hall &s;hine in the king|dom of their Father as the &s;tars for ever and ever. In the la&s;t place, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the con&s;ciences of the people in the &s;ight of God. Tongue cannot expre&s;s nor pen de&s;cribe what I felt. His word pierced my heart, and I was ready to roar in the di&s;quietude of my &s;oul. A little before he concluded, he &s;aid, Are there any in this place that &s;ee them|&s;elves &s;inners, that feel the want of Chri&s;t? My heart an&s;wered, I do; I know I am undone without his &s;aving benefits. He then rai&s;ed his voice, and &s;aid, "Behold now is the accepted time, now is the day of &s;alvation" The &s;ilent breathings of my &s;oul were, Lord, make it &s;o to me; take me into thine arms of mercy, for the &s;ake of Je&s;us. Pre&s;ently the &s;inner's Friend an&s;wered for him&s;elf, Go in peace, and &s;in no more.</P>
<P>Oh my dear Drurow, where &s;hall I find words to expre&s;s what I felt! All my guilt and di&s;tre&s;s was entirely removed; and the light of the glory of God, through his well-beloved Son, &s;hone into my &s;oul: the thunders of God's law, the cur&s;es I read in the Chri&s;tian's book, and which before daily terrified my mind, were all hu&s;hed into a divine &s;ilence; and the &s;weet promi&s;es, the charms of the ever glori|ous go&s;pel, elevated and captivated my &s;oul: the peace of God &s;weetly flowing into my heart, like the &s;welling &s;tream of jordan overflowing its banks; every mountain and hill was made low, the crook|ed was made &s;trait and rough places made plain. I had a clear &s;ight, by faith, of the dear Redeemer's &s;ufferings upon Calvary, bearing my &s;ins and my
<PB N="17" REF="028801_0017_0FDD4D6AE9BCF790">
cur&s;e in his own body on the tree; and from a di|vine &s;en&s;e of forgiving love, I could &s;ay with Tho|mas, one of his di&s;ciples, "My Lord, and my God!" O my dear friend, this God is the God I adore: had you but a ta&s;te of the &s;weetne&s;s I en|joy, you would no longer pay any regard to Darus, or any other of the gods of our nation.</P>
<P>The people among&s;t whom I found the precious pearl, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Methodi&s;ts; and, re&s;pecting the e&s;&s;ential points, they are all of one heart and mind, that is, &s;alva|tion through the name of Je&s;us, and none other; and, from a deep &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s, are pre&s;&s;ing forward toward the mark of the prize. There is a &s;weetne&s;s in this, different from every other thing in the world. Suppo&s;ing a man in the enjoyment of all the plea&s;ures, all the profits, or riches together, with all the airy applau&s;es of mortals, he will come infinitely &s;hort of the real happine&s;s the weake&s;t Chri&s;tian enjoys: they will no more balance the happine&s;s I feel at pre&s;ent. than the &s;malle&s;t feather the large&s;t mountain.</P>
<P>You are expert in war, and having been obliged to engage with our con&s;tant enemies; know the &s;atisfaction of a complete victory; your mind is elated with joy, whil&s;t laying the &s;poils of battle at the feet of your friends, and rejoice with them at your &s;afe return; but the Chri&s;tian's conque&s;t as far exceeds this, as the great things of eternity exceeds the &s;mall things of time; for "we wre&s;tle not with fle&s;h and blood, but likewi&s;e with princi|palities and powers, and wicked &s;pirits in high places; yea, the rulers of the darkne&s;s of this world, and by faith we are more than conquerors, through him that hath loved us."</P>
<P>I went to the &s;ame place next &s;abbath, where God was plea&s;ed to &s;hine upon my &s;oul, and provi|dentially met with my Chri&s;tian friend, who con|ducted me thither at the fir&s;t; he is now happily re&s;tored to the divine favor; for he told me under
<PB N="18" REF="028801_0018_0FDD4D6C322B4300">
the &s;ame &s;ermon God was plea&s;ed to heal all his back&s;lidings, and to love him freely.</P>
<P>I could &s;ay much more to my friend, but want of time forbids. May the dear Redeemer, who has been gracious to me, fa&s;ten the&s;e con&s;iderations up|on my friend's heart, and grant us an happy meeting at his right hand in the great day. I &s;hould be glad to hear from you the fir&s;t opportunity. Mean while I remain.</P>
