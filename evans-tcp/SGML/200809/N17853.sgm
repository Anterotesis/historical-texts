</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IN the former part of this chapter we have the parable of the &s;ow|er, and this cautionary precept of our SAVIOUR was probably intended as a practical applica|tion of it. The parable it&s;elf is undoubtedly familiar to all of you. The mor|al in&s;truction which it conveys is very obvious. It was manife&s;tly de&s;igned to repre&s;ent the preach|ing of the Go&s;pel, to mark the diver&s;ity which is ob&s;ervable in its reception, and to point out the manner in which it mu&s;t be heard, &s;o as to admit of the ble&s;&s;ed effect, to which it is ultimately directed. CHRIST in his di&s;cour&s;e teaches us, that to &s;ecure the per&s;onal advantages, and final benefit of a preached Go&s;pel, the hearing of it mu&s;t be like the operation of good &s;oil, upon &s;eed which is &s;own in it. The &s;oil mu&s;t be of &s;ufficient depth to receive the &s;eed, admit of its taking &s;uitably deep root, favour the principle of vegetation, and its progre&s;s to maturity, or there will
<PB N="6" REF="023136_0004_0FBC83EDDE3E3BB8">
be no fruit. So in the expo&s;ition of the parable, CHRIST explicitly a&s;&s;ures us, that no good and per|manent benefit can be &s;ecured to hearers, from the preaching of the mo&s;t weighty and intere&s;ting truths, unle&s;s they are heard in a manner, corre&s;pondent to their &s;olemnity, and the obligations which attend them. He teaches us, that neither the &s;upine, &s;tu|pid multitude, who give a tran&s;ient attention to the Go&s;pel, as a matter of cour&s;e only; nor tho&s;e un|feeling triflers, who attend to it merely as a matter of &s;peculation; nor even tho&s;e, who for a little time are convinced of the reality and importance of the truths of Chri&s;tianity, but &s;oon lo&s;e this conviction, in &s;cenes of bu&s;ine&s;s or gaiety; can, in the indulgence of their re&s;pective habits, be &s;avingly benefited by the preaching of the Go&s;pel. The &s;ub&s;tance of what CHRIST urges, is this, that men mu&s;t be in that moral &s;ituation which will admit of a due reception of the Go&s;pel, that they mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed to receive it cor|dially, that they mu&s;t reduce it to a uniform and con|&s;cientious practice, and that then, and then only, will they bring forth fruit to the glory of GOD and their own &s;alvation. Such being the importance of hear|ing the Go&s;pel rightly; with great force and propri|ety did CHRIST addre&s;s the cautionary injunction to his di&s;ciples, and by them to us, <HI>Take heed how ye hear.</HI> And it cannot but affect us with a particular &s;olemnity that he adds, <HI>for who&s;oever hath, to him &s;hall be given; and who&s;oever hath not, from him &s;hall be taken, even that which he &s;eemeth to have.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the pa&s;&s;age, connected with the explanatory ob&s;ervations which have been made, we are obviou&s;|ly

<P>HERE let us for a moment con&s;ider what is the <HI>de|&s;ign</HI> of the Go&s;pel; for that will help us to deter|mine, what tho&s;e truths are, which &s;hould be chiefly in&s;i&s;ted on, in the preaching of it. The Go&s;pel is not de&s;igned to develop the principles of civil gov|ernment, or furni&s;h a philo&s;ophical &s;urvey of the material &s;y&s;tem. It is not de&s;igned to make men politicians, arti&s;ts, or proficients in hu&s;bandry. It is not de&s;igned to teach them &s;kill, or to &s;timulate them to enterprize, in worldly pur&s;uits; but to make them

holy. Its grand object is, to exhibit the true char|acter, the will, and the purpo&s;es of GOD; to di&s;play the medium of &s;alvation for &s;inners; and to mark out the path in which they mu&s;t go, that they may be a&s;&s;imilated to GOD, be rein&s;tated in his favour, and become candidates for, and the final po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of cele&s;tial ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. Whatever truths then have an obvious direction to the&s;e objects, and are inti|mately connected with them, are to be principally in&s;i&s;ted on in the mini&s;tration of the Go&s;pel. Give me leave to de&s;cend to a few particulars.</P>
<P>IT cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that men will be truly re|ligious, that they will love GOD, and be happy in him, unle&s;s they have ju&s;t views of his character. The attributes of the DEITY then, as the foundation of all religion, and forming the di&s;tingui&s;hing glories of the divine character, are to be illu&s;trated, as far as they are di&s;coverable, from the light of nature, and the holy &s;criptures. It is not conceivable that men will feel that they are &s;inners, the objects of divine abhorrence, and expo&s;ed to puni&s;hment, and realize their need of that atonement which the Go&s;pel pro|po&s;es, unle&s;s they know whether they are tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the divine law; and this they cannot decide un|til they become acquainted with it. The moral law then, as a tran&s;cript of the divine nature, and containing the &s;um of our duty, is to be di&s;tinctly explained, and warmly enforced. Farther&mdash;How can men realize their proper moral &s;tanding with re&s;pect to GOD and his kingdom, and their need of &s;upernatural agency to transform and &s;anctify, and of the blood of JESUS to clean&s;e them, unle&s;s they
<PB N="9" REF="023136_0007_0FBC83F467B348C8">
are made acquainted with their fallen, <HI>i. e.</HI> with their totally &s;inful &s;tate? The hi&s;tory then of the original lap&s;e of human nature, and the exten&s;ively dreadful con&s;equences of it, mu&s;t be faithfully given. The decided declarations of Scripture, on this &s;ubject, mu&s;t not be withheld; that <HI>we are by nature children of wrath, being children of di&s;obedience</HI>; that <HI>we are dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins</HI>; that <HI>the carnal heart is en|mity again&s;t GOD, not &s;ubject to his law, neither indeed can be.</HI> Hence too the doctrine of regeneration, as wrought by the agency of the HOLY SPIRIT, is a cardinal doctrine of the Bible; is e&s;&s;ential to the &s;cheme of religion there exhibited; and though called in que&s;tion by &s;ome, and derided by others, is one which cannot be too critically explained, or too pe|remptorily urged. It is &s;o clearly taught by CHRIST and his Apo&s;tles, that the chri&s;tian preacher, in his publick mini&s;trations, cannot pa&s;s it over, or conceal its importance, without trea&s;on again&s;t his Ma&s;ter, and the cau&s;e he has profe&s;&s;edly e&s;pou&s;ed. That men may know whether they exerci&s;e a holy tru&s;t in GOD, and are prepared to join the triumph of An|gels in his government; and that they may be led to anticipations of that triumph; the nature of the divine admini&s;tration, with re&s;pect to the immutable plan of it, as laid in the eternal and predeterminate coun&s;els of the DEITY, as comprehending the conditions of creatures, and operating in the way of a gracious election, holy &s;overeignty, and perfect benevolence, is to be held up to view in all its extent and glory. In connexion with the&s;e &s;ubjects, that which was the leading one of the Apo&s;tles' addre&s;&s;es, the &s;alvation of the cro&s;s, in re&s;pect to its author, its nature, and
<PB N="10" REF="023136_0008_0FBC83F5FA03E9D8">
i&s;&s;ue, as it mu&s;t warm the heart, will be frequently the theme of the faithful preacher. To his fellow &s;inners he will exhibit the LORD JESUS CHRIST, in his ab&s;olute divinity, as the only Saviour. The dif|ferent offices which belong to his mediatorial charac|ter he will explain: The nature and &s;ufficiency of his atonement he will delineate: The terms of an inter|e&s;t in it, repentance and faith, he will illu&s;trate and enforce; together with its infallible &s;afety as a ground of dependence. It is highly important al&s;o, that the invariable connexion between faith, and a per&s;onal compliance with the duties which we owe to GOD and our fellow creatures, be fully urged. And that men may be per&s;uaded to live by faith on the SON of GOD, and to lead holy and unblamable lives; that &s;inners may be awakened, and &s;aints prompted to zeal and diligence, the &s;olemn realities of death, judgment, and eternity, are to be di&s;played in their utmo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. The endle&s;s horrors of the world of puni&s;hment, and the glories of the heavenly paradi&s;e, are to be paint|ed in all their &s;olemnity and lu&s;tre. Publick and prevalent &s;ins are to be the &s;ubject of reproof. Men's accountablene&s;s at the bar of GOD for every thing done here in the body, is to be &s;olemnly taught; and many other intere&s;ting topicks there are, which a true mini&s;ter of CHRIST, in fidelity to his Ma&s;ter, and the &s;ouls of men, will in&s;i&s;t on with hone&s;t fervour and boldne&s;s. In a word, the whole coun&s;el of GOD, as contained in the Holy Scriptures, is to be exhibited without partiality or palliation; as becomes a dying man, &s;tanding on the verge of eternity, and &s;oon to leave the pre&s;ent &s;cene, for the &s;olemn adjudications of another, and an endle&s;s &s;tate. We are now to &s;hew</P>

<P>THESE, my friends, are not mere philo&s;ophick &s;peculations, or matters of tran&s;ient occurrence. They are truths, weighty, divine and eternal; in which the everla&s;ting life or death of every &s;on and daugh|ter of Adam is embarked. The&s;e are truths which the SON of GOD came into the world to reveal and propagate; they have been &s;ealed by his blood; they have been witne&s;&s;ed to, by the tragical deaths of innumerable martyrs; and there is no room to doubt, but that the Go&s;pel which con&s;i&s;ts of them, will operate as a &s;avour of life unto life, or of death unto death, to every one of us here pre&s;ent. We &s;hall all of us &s;oon find, that &s;uch is the importance of hearing &s;uitably, this Go&s;pel, that <HI>who&s;oever hath, to him &s;hall be given; and who&s;oever hath not, from him &s;hall be taken, even that which he &s;eemeth to have.</HI> How then &s;hould we hear?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WITH hone&s;t and good hearts.</HI> This is what CHRIST expre&s;sly inculcates, in a ver&s;e preceding our text. <HI>But that on the good ground are they, which in an hone&s;t and good heart, having heard the word, keep it and bring forth fruit with patience.</HI> Nothing is &s;o in|&s;uperable an ob&s;tacle to &s;aving improvement, under the preaching of the Go&s;pel, as a vitiated and un|&s;anctified heart. It is indeed as ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;i|ble, that a heart un&s;ubdued by divine grace, and re|taining its native aver&s;ion to divine things, &s;hould well receive and duly improve the Go&s;pel, as that a rock &s;hould receive &s;eed, and rear it up to fruit|fulne&s;s. Hence the apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>They that are in the
<PB N="12" REF="023136_0010_0FBC83F8EEBD2620">
fle&s;h,</HI> they who retain a depraved heart, and are not led by the SPIRIT, <HI>cannot plea&s;e GOD</HI>; tho&s;e who <HI>re|ceive not the truth in the love of it</HI> are expre&s;sly con|demned. What can be more indi&s;putable, and ob|vious, than that holy exerci&s;es are ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to render a performance beneficial, and accepta|ble? What is there of duty in a prayer offered up with the lips only, without &s;incerity or affection? What is there in an external act of charity, which can be acceptable to GOD, when he him&s;elf, and the proper motives of action, are di&s;regarded? Of what advantage was it to the di&s;obedient Jews, to be ad|dre&s;&s;ed with the glorious and endearing truths which CHRIST preached, while they were his inveterate enemies, and were re&s;olved to per&s;ecute him, and his di&s;ciples, to the la&s;t extremity? Hence holine&s;s of heart is the primary thing enjoined in the Scrip|tures. <HI>My &s;on give me thine heart.&mdash;Ca&s;t away from you all your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, whereby you have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t me, and make you a new heart, and a new &s;pirit, for, Why will ye die, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael?</HI> How corre&s;|pondent with this &s;entiment is the injunction of the apo&s;tle&mdash;<HI>As new born babes de&s;ire the &s;incere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE truths of the Go&s;pel mu&s;t be heard with <HI>&s;olemn and &s;erious attention.</HI></P>
<P>IT certainly can an&s;wer no valuable purpo&s;e for you, my friends, to come to the hou&s;e of GOD, un|le&s;s you attend &s;eriou&s;ly to the proper bu&s;ine&s;s before you. If you bring the world with you into the &s;anctuary&mdash;if in&s;tead of wor&s;hipping GOD in &s;pirit and in truth, and giving that attention to divine
<PB N="13" REF="023136_0011_0FBC83FA6F7AEC28">
truths, which the nature of the Sabbath, and the im|portance of the truths them&s;elves clearly demand, your minds are occupied in &s;en&s;ual and worldly con|cerns&mdash;Can GOD be plea&s;ed with you, or can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that you will be gainers by the Go&s;pel? Inattention to the faithful preaching of the Go&s;pel, is in every view totally inexcu&s;able. It is a &s;hame|ful index of a hard, &s;tupid, and unfeeling heart. The Go&s;pel is of con&s;equence enough to engage atten|tion, whether we con&s;ider it as the only medium of our &s;alvation, or as a &s;ource of moral in&s;truction merely; and the motives which are adapted to &s;ecure this attention, are certainly numerous and weighty. The&s;e motives, however, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion by and by to exhibit more fully. I take leave but to ob&s;erve here, that whatever good individuals may obtain by the preaching of the Go&s;pel, it is impo&s;|&s;ible that any advantage &s;hould be obtained with|out attention.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a man comes to the hou&s;e of GOD, and the mo&s;t &s;olemn truths are delivered, and in the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t forcible manner&mdash;yet if he &s;leep, or employ his time in gazing on trifling objects, or in &s;tudying how he may &s;ucce&s;sfully pu&s;h his world|ly &s;chemes&mdash;In what re&s;pect will he be the wi&s;er or the better? He will go out of the hou&s;e of GOD as ignorant and as &s;tupid as he came in, and will be more the child of hell than before. <HI>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of GOD.</HI> But how can there be this hearing without &s;erious attention?</P>
<P N="3">3. THE truths of the Go&s;pel &s;hould be heard <HI>without prejudice.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="023136_0012_0FBC83FDB3AFC408">PREJUDICE has a mo&s;t pernicious influence in the minds of men: It is like a deep rooted, and incur|able di&s;ea&s;e, which re&s;i&s;ts all applications, and fore|bodes certain death. When a &s;pirit of prejudice is imbibed, either again&s;t truth, again&s;t religion in gen|eral, again&s;t a mini&s;ter, or profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity; but little good is to be expected from the mo&s;t dil|igent labours. There is &s;carce any thing which more ob&s;tructs the genuine progre&s;s of the Go&s;pel than this. It renders the &s;ubject of it deaf to all rea|&s;on, to all reproof, and may entirely defeat the mo&s;t benevolent exertions for his good. Prejudice has fomented enmities, divided churches and &s;ocieties, made man an enemy to man, and has probably done more towards peopling the world of darkne&s;s with wretched inhabitants, than is conceivable. We &s;hould therefore make it our great concern, to have all our prejudices mortified; we &s;hould be open to conviction; we &s;hould be candid, and liberal; ready to yield to the light of truth whenever it is ex|hibited. For he will be likely to know mo&s;t, and to judge righte&s;t, who&s;e mind is lea&s;t under the &s;hac|kles of prejudice, and who&s;e ingenuous heart is mo&s;t open to the light of revelation.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE truths which are exhibited in the preach|ing of the Go&s;pel, ought certainly to be heard, <HI>with|out a cavilling and captious &s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are many people who attend upon the &s;o|lemnities of publick wor&s;hip, with &s;carce any other view than to find fault. They come to the hou&s;e of GOD, not to honour him, not to &s;eek his favour and learn their duty; but to di&s;cover imperfections

in the preacher, in his manner, in his language, or in his doctrines; that they may have the malicious plea&s;ure of railing again&s;t him afterwards, and di&s;af|fecting others towards him. Is this a proper return for the benevolent exertions of a faithful mini&s;ter? Is this the &s;pirit, with which we &s;hould appear in the &s;anctuary of the LORD GOD of ho&s;ts? Is this the temper, with which the Go&s;pel of the meek SAVIOUR &s;hould be heard? What an unamiable di&s;po&s;ition of mind is this! What protection can it meet with, my friends, before the bar of that Being, who&s;e &s;olemn requi&s;ition is, <HI>Take heed how ye hear</HI>; and who can approve of tho&s;e only, who, <HI>as new born babes de&s;ire the &s;incere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby?</HI> And what an effectual barrier mu&s;t &s;uch a &s;pirit be, to preclude all the benign influences of the ble&s;&s;ed truths of Chri&s;tianity! How much more lovely and charming is the temper of that man, who is formed to benevolent propen&s;ities, who loves to throw a veil of charity over the defects and unde&s;igned devia|tions of his mini&s;ter, and who&s;e ultimate de&s;ire is to be made better by the &s;olemn truths he delivers!</P>
<P N="5">5. THE truths of the Go&s;pel &s;hould be heard, with a <HI>&s;erious re&s;pect to tho&s;e very truths, and not from an idle unmeaning curio&s;ity, or a chief regard to the manner, lan|guage, and addre&s;s of the &s;peaker.</HI></P>
<P>WE come not to the hou&s;e of GOD, that is, if we come rightly, to &s;ee new things, or to gratify a tri|fling &s;pirit. We come not to the temple of the LORD, as many go to a concert or theatre, to have the ear plea&s;ed with mu&s;ick, the flowing ea&s;e of language, or the graces of oratory. And to gratify people in

their undue thir&s;t for the&s;e objects, can never be &s;o|licitou&s;ly &s;ought by that mini&s;ter, who con&s;iders that he is &s;peaking for GOD, and that the eternal life or death of his hearers is, as it were, &s;u&s;pended on every word he utters. It will be rather his concern, faith|fully to declare the whole coun&s;el of GOD, and to win &s;ouls to CHRIST. And tho&s;e people only will hear in a right and profitable manner, who chiefly regard the <HI>truth,</HI> who have con&s;ciences open to conviction, and who realize that the Go&s;pel contains an infinitely mo|mentous addre&s;s to them from the King of Heaven, and that if they receive it not, it will be but a &s;avour of death unto death to them.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE Go&s;pel &s;hould be heard <HI>with prayerfulne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>MINISTERS are but humble in&s;truments in the ac|compli&s;hment of the de&s;igns of grace. <HI>Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but GOD that giveth the increa&s;e.</HI> As with re&s;pect to our exi&s;tence, <HI>in him we live, and move, and have our beings</HI>; &s;o with re&s;pect to every moral good exerci&s;e of heart, <HI>he worketh in us, both to will and to do, of his good plea&s;|ure.</HI> On the favourable gales, and friendly influ|ences of his &s;pirit, are we dependent, &s;o that with|out them the Go&s;pel will be preached ab&s;olutely in vain.

Then, in the lan|guage of the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>the righteous would flouri&s;h like the palm tree, he would grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</HI> Thrice happy that man who walks with GOD, and while he is hearing divine truths di&s;pen&s;ed, lifts the pious de&s;ires of his &s;oul to him, that tho&s;e truths may &s;ink deep into his heart, and be a mean of his conformity to his Maker.</P>
<P N="7">7. IF we would comply with the direction of CHRIST, in our manner of hearing the weighty truths of his Go&s;pel, we mu&s;t hear them <HI>with a di&s;po&s;ition, and readine&s;s to obey them in our practice.</HI> Faith mu&s;t be attended with the external te&s;timony of good works. Theory is of little u&s;e without practice. The more we become acquainted with the character of GOD, the greater are our obligations to love it, and to exhibit the fruit of &s;uch a love, the purity of a holy conduct. The end of &s;tudying the Go&s;pel and its precepts, is, that we may rejoice in the one, and fulfil the other.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE Go&s;pel &s;hould be heard <HI>as a me&s;&s;age from GOD, and not from men.</HI> It is a revelation from GOD, and contains the be&s;t news that were ever publi&s;hed to the univer&s;e. It is to be heard therefore as the
<PB N="18" REF="023136_0016_0FBC8405E53C93D8">
word of GOD, and not as the word of men. It be|hoves us to give heed to it, as a proclamation from Heaven, announcing terms of peace to rebellious creatures; on the improvement of which depends our eternal well being. It is to be attended to, not as the dream of an enthu&s;ia&s;t, or a compilation of fabulous legends, but as the unalterable word of the immuta|ble GOD. This inve&s;ts it with a &s;olemnity which de|mands the deepe&s;t regard&mdash;which requires us to yield up our under&s;tandings to its in&s;tructions with implicit faith; and did we attend to it duly under this con&s;id|eration, every &s;entiment would come to us with irre|&s;i&s;tible weight, and it would be impo&s;&s;ible for us to be ea&s;y while di&s;obedient to its requirements.</P>
<P N="9">9. THE preaching of the Go&s;pel &s;hould be heard <HI>under a &s;en&s;e of the uncertainty of its enjoyment.</HI></P>
<P>OPPORTUNITY to attend to the overtures of re|deeming grace is a precarious privilege. The means of &s;piritual improvement may be &s;hortly taken from us, and the things which relate to our everla&s;t|ing peace, may be &s;oon hid from our eyes. We are &s;liding with rapidity, on the tide of time, into the boundle&s;s ocean of eternity. Very &s;oon our &s;eats in the hou&s;e of GOD will be vacant, or be filled by others. The Go&s;pel, as to us, will be publi&s;hed no more, and all opportunity for gaining in&s;truction unto &s;alvation will be lo&s;t forever. How &s;erious and &s;olicitous &s;hould this con&s;ideration make us in our attention to the glorious Go&s;pel of CHRIST; e&s;|pecially &s;ince it mu&s;t be eventually a &s;avour of life unto life or of death unto death to us!&mdash;Which brings me to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="023136_0017_0FBC840735A36E18"><HI>Finally,</HI> THAT we ought by all means to hear the Go&s;pel, not only as dying, but as <HI>accountable creatures.</HI></P>
<P>OUR accountablene&s;s at the bar of GOD &s;hould &s;timulate us to the greate&s;t circum&s;pection and dil|igence in every duty. The declarations of the Holy Scripture on this &s;ubject are delivered in &s;uch &s;olemn language as this&mdash;<HI>Wo unto thee, Chorazin, wo unto thee, Beth&s;aida; for if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes. But I &s;ay un|to you, that it &s;hall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, at the day of judgment, than for you. Who&s;oever hath, to him &s;hall be given; but who&s;oever hath not, from him &s;hall be taken, even that which he &s;eemeth to have. He that de&s;pi&s;ed Mo&s;es' law, died without mercy under two or three witne&s;&s;es; of how much &s;orer puni&s;hment &s;uppo&s;e ye, &s;hall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the SON of GOD, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was &s;anctified, an unholy thing, and hath done de&s;pite unto the SPIRIT of grace.</HI> What can be more &s;olemn than the&s;e declarations! To what an infinitely awful and intere&s;ting &s;cene do they point us! As &s;tewards, we are to remember that we are to be re&s;pon&s;ible for our &s;piritual privi|leges, at the tribunal of the great GOD. Solemn in|quiry will be made whether we have li&s;tened duly to the proclamations of his grace. At that period of grand a&s;&s;ize, when the intelligent univer&s;e &s;hall be a&s;&s;embled before the SUPREME JUDGE, to &s;u&s;tain their re&s;pective irrever&s;ible allotments, we &s;hall be weigh|ed in the balance of divine truth, and find, to our eternal joy or &s;orrow, that nothing is more impor|tant

than a due hearing of the truths of Chri&s;tianity, Now under the influence of the&s;e va&s;t and weighty ideas, we &s;hould hear the Go&s;pel, and certainly if we do, our attention will be very &s;erious.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE third particular which was to engage our attention, you recollect was, The importance of hearing the Go&s;pel in a right manner.</P>
<P>THIS part of our &s;ubject I have in a mea&s;ure una|voidably anticipated, in what has been already &s;aid; but you will &s;uffer me to make &s;ome enlargement.</P>
<P>A SUITABLE hearing of the Go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, is of great importance, becau&s;e it mu&s;t conduce in the highe&s;t degree to our reputation and u&s;efulne&s;s. The knowledge of the &s;ublime truths, and great du|ties of religion, connected with their &s;anctifying in|fluence on the heart, will go far towards furni&s;hing a man for the di&s;charge of the various duties of life with honour to him&s;elf, and exten&s;ive advantage to others. This will qualify him to contribute e&s;&s;en|tially to the good of his fellow creatures, in different capacities and relations. It is this, more than any one thing, which forms the good &s;tate&s;man, the up|right patriot, the charitable benefactor, the con&s;tant friend, the amiable &s;piritual in&s;tructor, the firm &s;up|porter of the truth, the kind neighbour, the humane ma&s;ter, and the tender relative. He who hears properly, who imbibes and practi&s;es, the e&s;&s;ential principles of Chri&s;tianity, is a pillar of &s;ociety and an ornament of his generation. He goes about, in imitation of his Divine Ma&s;ter, doing good. He wipes the tear from affliction's eye. He e&s;pou&s;es the intere&s;ts of publick and private happine&s;s. His
<PB N="21" REF="023136_0019_0FBC840A320B10D0">
prayers draw down ble&s;&s;ings upon a guilty world. He lives revered, and when he dies, &s;ociety feels the &s;hock, and the ble&s;&s;ings of many come upon him. Farther,</P>
<P>TO hear the Go&s;pel rightly is of the highe&s;t im|portance to the happine&s;s of the pre&s;ent life. <HI>The ways of wi&s;dom are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths are peace. Great peace,</HI> &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>have they who love thy law, and nothing &s;hall offend them.</HI> The man who has heard the Go&s;pel in the love of it, who has made it his object to learn and to fulfil his duty, who has been careful to treat the &s;olemnities of Rev|elation with that deference and attention which they claim, is happy. He is happy in that he has a &s;y&s;|tem of faith on which he leans, and which will not admit of his being driven about by every wind of doctrine. He is not ea&s;ily turned a&s;ide from the foundations of his hope, or the comforts of it, by the glooms of melancholy, the cavils of the &s;ceptick, or the jeers of the &s;coffer. He is happy in that he is prepared to &s;u&s;tain the calamities of life with forti|tude and &s;erenity. His principles, views, affections and hopes di&s;arm adver&s;ity of its &s;ting, and furni&s;h him with tho&s;e con&s;olations, which are more than a counterbalance to the &s;evere&s;t &s;troke of affliction. Which leads me to ob&s;erve, that he is more e&s;pecial|ly happy in his devotional exerci&s;es. Heaven is &s;hed into his bo&s;om. He has anticipations of fu|ture ble&s;&s;edne&s;s which are not to be conceived by natural men. His own experience teaches him, that <HI>the kingdom of GOD is not meat and drink, but right|eou&s;ne&s;s, and peace, and joy in the HOLY GHOST.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="023136_0020_0FBC840C21B787E0">LET us now for a moment look at a character the rever&s;e of this. Con&s;ider him as born in a chri&s;tian land, taught to read his Bible from his childhood, and led, in compliance with education and habit, to attend generally on the publick wor&s;hip of the Sab|bath; but he has never read the Scriptures with an intere&s;ted attention and evangelical &s;pirit. His heart has &s;till remained hard, &s;tupid, and uninfluenced by religion. Though he is pre&s;ent &s;tatedly in the hou&s;e of GOD, he is trifling and inattentive. His mind is buried in worldly concerns. Or if in a mea&s;ure ex|ternally attentive, &s;ome darling prejudice perhaps has made him deaf to every rational &s;entiment, and to all the remon&s;trances of truth. He has made no &s;erious inquiries into his own per&s;onal &s;tate, or fu|ture pro&s;pects; and having no reli&s;h for &s;piritual ob|jects, he is a &s;tranger to the &s;incere devotional effu|&s;ions of the humble heart. Such is the character of one who hears the Go&s;pel carele&s;sly. He is in a chri&s;tle&s;s, &s;piritually dead &s;tate. The con&s;equence is, he is almo&s;t as ignorant as a heathen of the great principles and glorious &s;cheme of Revelation; and is of cour&s;e liable to become a prey to every de|lu&s;ion. He is neither furni&s;hed, nor di&s;po&s;ed to communicate in&s;truction to his hou&s;ehold, nor to ben|efit his neighbours in their mo&s;t important concerns. While he is expo&s;ed with others to di&s;appointments, di&s;tre&s;&s;es and cro&s;&s;es; this peculiar infelicity attends him, that he is not armed again&s;t them. His con|ver&s;ation is not improving. It &s;avours not of Heav|en, but of pre&s;ent and &s;en&s;ual things. His example is poi&s;onous. Death is his terror. In &s;hort, he has a bare exi&s;tence, without &s;olid enjoyment.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="023136_0021_0FBC840D2DD0DDD8">BUT the importance of hearing the Go&s;pel rightly ri&s;es, and appears to be infinitely great, as it re&s;pects our eternal welfare. Here the va&s;tne&s;s of the &s;ub|ject eludes our conceptions. On this are &s;u&s;pended the amazing deci&s;ions of the future world. Though we are by nature and practice &s;inners, and condemn|ed by the laws of GOD to endle&s;s woe; we are not left in ab&s;olutely hopele&s;s circum&s;tances. A SAV|IOUR is provided, and offered to us; pardon is pro|claimed in his name to the penitent and believing. The declaration is made, <HI>Today if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts</HI>; and we are a&s;&s;ured that <HI>there is no other name under heaven given among&s;t men whereby we can be &s;aved</HI>; and that <HI>he who believ|eth and is baptized &s;hall be &s;aved</HI>; and that <HI>he who believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> The pre&s;ent is a &s;tate of probation. At death it is clo&s;ed. The allot|ments beyond it are retributive, fixed, and irrever&s;i|ble. If we hear the Go&s;pel rightly, receive with cor|diality its gracious overtures, become the &s;ubjects of the genuine &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, and the true follow|ers of the LAMB, the Go&s;pel will operate as a &s;a|vour of life unto life to us. Its promi&s;es will be ours. We &s;hall die in peace. <HI>This corruptible will put on incorruption, and this mortal immortality.</HI>&mdash; Through the gloomy valley of the &s;hadow of death, the divine pre&s;ence will irradiate our way, and we &s;hall be brought to the <HI>general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;tborn, to</HI> JESUS <HI>the mediator of the new covenant, and to an innumerable company of angels.</HI> We &s;hall be embo&s;omed in the embraces of Almighty Love, and &s;hall be making progre&s;s in knowledge, in dig|nity and happine&s;s, to all eternity.

Our doom will be pro|nounced by the lips of JESUS him&s;elf, <HI>Depart ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his an|gels.</HI> We &s;hall be excluded from the &s;ociety, the peace, and bli&s;s of Heaven. Hope will be extingui&s;hed in our bo&s;oms, and leave them to be the man&s;ions of de&s;pair. Never more &s;hall we hear the invitations of the Go&s;|pel, or have opportunity to believe unto &s;alvation. Our re&s;idence mu&s;t be, in the lake of fire and brim|&s;tone.

And it ought to be ob&s;erved, and I pray that we may deeply realize the truth, that our puni&s;hment will be aggravatedly inten&s;e, in proportion to the privileges which we enjoy. Our mi&s;ery will be more intolerable than heathens, who have no Go&s;pel to account for. Their treatment at the hands of their Judge, will be far more lenient, their doom will be far le&s;s deplorable, than what tho&s;e of us will

experience, who have had the Bible in our hands, and been favoured with the publication of its glorious truths, from Sabbath to Sabbath, and yet have reject|ed them. GOD will not &s;ee his SON &s;lighted, and yet hold his de&s;pi&s;ers guiltle&s;s. He cannot be an indiffer|ent &s;pectator of ungrateful abu&s;es of his grace. And by how much he loves his only begotten SON, by &s;o much will he make the contemner of him feel the weight of his di&s;plea&s;ure. Now the only way to &s;hun this immen&s;e mi&s;ery on the one hand; and to &s;ecure the enjoyments of heaven on the other, is to hear the Go&s;pel of the SON of GOD <HI>rightly.</HI> We mu&s;t trea&s;ure up the truth into good and hone&s;t hearts, receive it in the love of it, hear as accountable creatures, and with that &s;erious and practical diligence, which become &s;uch &s;olemn realities. This is the great thing which we need as immortal creatures. Many other things may be of advantage to us in this world, but nothing el&s;e will do for the other. Learning, exten&s;ive knowledge in different branches of human &s;cience, may make us re&s;pectable in the &s;ight of men; but without the genuine influence of religion, we &s;hall be odious in the &s;ight of GOD. Skill in trade may facilitate your worldly advancement, and furni&s;h you with the means of figure, and grandeur; but it can never &s;ave you from hell, or put you into heaven. Ingenuity in the mechanick arts, may make your circum&s;tances comfortable in this world; but can never make your circum&s;tances comfortable in eter|nity. Diligence and prudence in hu&s;bandry, may fill your &s;tores and your barns with valuable com|modities; but can never in&s;ure you a trea&s;ure in heaven.

<P N="1">1. FROM the preceding ob&s;ervations, we may a&s;|&s;ign the rea&s;on why preaching does no more good among mankind in general. It is very obvious that if the truths of the Go&s;pel were clearly, faithfully, and forcibly delivered; and if they were heard with that cordiality, candour, prayerfulne&s;s, and &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s, to which they are entitled, the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed ef|fects would be produced. Religion would be the cement of &s;ociety, and the &s;tability of the times. Hypocri&s;y would be extirpated from churches. Ig|norance and &s;tupidity would be bani&s;hed. The light of the Go&s;pel would break forth as the morn|ing, and the &s;alvation which it proclaims, would wear a brightne&s;s like a lamp that burneth.

fraud and fal&s;ehood, reign triumphant. Genuine Chri&s;tianity has but few adherents; and even tho&s;e who profe&s;s to love CHRIST, at lea&s;t many of them, &s;eem a&s;hamed of his cau&s;e, and act as though they really thought him unworthy of their obedience. What can be the rea&s;on of this? Certainly a prin|cipal one is, that the great truths of the Go&s;pel are not generally preached with that clearne&s;s, fidelity, and fervour; and are not heard with that cordiality, attention, candour, and prayerfulne&s;s, to which they are entitled.</P>
<P N="1">1. SUCH being the Go&s;pel when properly exhibit|ed, the manner in which it is to be heard, and the un&s;peakable importance of hearing it rightly, we can &s;carcely fail of feeling our ab&s;olute need of a &s;uper|natural agency and ble&s;&s;ing. As preachers, and as hearers, we may alike exclaim, <HI>Who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things! Without divine &s;trength we can do nothing.</HI> If we are left to our&s;elves we &s;hall, not|with&s;tanding the fulne&s;s and glory of the Go&s;pel, and the frequent publication of it, trea&s;ure up to our&s;elves wrath, again&s;t the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of GOD. On our knees then let us daily fall; and as dependent, polluted creatures, humbly implore the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, the guidance of the HOLY SPIRIT, and grace to help in every time of need.</P>
<P N="3">3. FROM the preceding di&s;cour&s;e we may infer, that the duties which are incumbent on a mini&s;ter and people re&s;pecting the Go&s;pel, are the mo&s;t &s;ol|emn and weighty that belong to man. It is his province to watch for &s;ouls as one who mu&s;t give

It behoves him at his eternal peril to warn every man, to declare the whole coun&s;el of GOD, and to endeavour by every po&s;&s;ible mean to be in&s;tru|mental in the progre&s;s of the REDEEMER's kingdom, and the &s;alvation of precious &s;ouls. He mu&s;t not be intimidated from the faithful pro&s;ecution of his duty, by the malice or the ridicule of men. Per&s;ecution he mu&s;t patiently encounter, in whatever &s;hape it may meet him. Truths which are grating to the proud hearts of &s;inners, he mu&s;t not &s;uppre&s;s, le&s;t they &s;hould give di&s;gu&s;t. But he mu&s;t be faithful to GOD, and to his own con&s;cience, and cheerfully ri&s;que the con&s;equence. On the other hand, people, to whom the truths of the Go&s;pel are addre&s;&s;ed, are bound to <HI>take heed how they hear,</HI> to <HI>receive the truth in the love of it,</HI> to practi&s;e it, to feel its importance, and to act from the influence of it. They are bound to hear as under the in&s;pection of their Judge, and as ha&s;tening on the &s;wift wings of time to his bar; always remembering, that the rule of judgment, re|&s;pecting the Go&s;pel, is to be, <HI>who&s;oever hath, to him &s;hall be given; but who&s;oever hath not, from him &s;hall be taken, even that which he &s;eemeth to have.</HI></P>

And ina&s;|much as &s;ome intricate doctrines mu&s;t be preached and explained, and the manner of treating them may be mi&s;under&s;tood, whenever per&s;ons are di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied and feel an oppo&s;ition to them prevailing in their minds, I reque&s;t that they would be &s;o ingenuous as to conver&s;e familiarly with me on their difficulties, that I may have a fair opportunity to remove them, that &s;o that harmony which is the only ba&s;is of hap|py &s;ociety may be &s;ecured.</P>
<P>ON your part, my brethren, you &s;ee your duty. Obey then the injunction, <HI>Take heed how ye hear.</HI> Hear with hone&s;t, good, and believing hearts. Hear with &s;olemn and &s;erious attention. Hear without prejudice. Hear without a captious and cavilling &s;pirit. Hear from an intere&s;ted re&s;pect to the truths of the Go&s;pel; and not from an idle curio&s;ity, or a chief regard to the manner, language, and ad|dre&s;s of the &s;peaker. Hear with prayerfulne&s;s. Hear
<PB N="31" REF="023136_0029_0FBC841FDA70D068">
with a di&s;po&s;ition and readine&s;s to obey in your uniform practice. Hear the Go&s;pel as the word of GOD, and not as the word of men. Hear under a &s;en&s;e of the uncertainty of its enjoyment. And hear as creatures who are to give account at the la&s;t great day, and who&s;e eternal &s;tate is to be determined by their reception or rejection of the Go&s;pel. Let me be encouraged by your &s;trict and con&s;cientious at|tendance on the publick exerci&s;es of the LORD's hou&s;e. Do not &s;uffer your&s;elves to fall into habits of &s;loth and tarrying at home on the Sabbath. Let me, I entreat you, be favoured with a &s;olemn attention to the truths I am called to deliver. Let every one remember that he mu&s;t give an account for the manner in which he treats the Go&s;pel. Deeply re|alize that if you neglect the great &s;alvation which it propo&s;es; if you fail to hear rightly its intere&s;ting truths; if you manife&s;t an indifference and di&s;re&s;pect to the proclamations of redeeming grace, and refu&s;e a compliance with them; de&s;truction will mo&s;t a&s;|&s;uredly overtake you as an armed man, and there will be no e&s;cape. Lay feelingly to heart the aggra|vated guilt, which mu&s;t attend a voluntary, and ha|bitual abu&s;e, of that exhibition of almighty love which is addre&s;&s;ed to you in the Go&s;pel. Con&s;ider what angui&s;h will penetrate your &s;ouls at the day of judgment, if you are unhappily found to have re|ceived this grace of GOD in vain. Remember that if ye believe not, &s;till <HI>GOD abideth faithful; he cannot deny him&s;elf.</HI> The Eternal Word, found in the form of a &s;ervant, addre&s;&s;ing &s;inners, by the mini&s;ters of his kingdom, with the endearing per&s;ua&s;ions of &s;uf|fering love, cannot be di&s;regarded with impunity.

Con&s;ider al&s;o the pre&s;ent felicity, and the intermina|ble future glory, which are annexed, by divine prom|i&s;e, to a due hearing, to a cordial admi&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel. Welcome then, I entreat you, its in&s;truc|tions, and let them have control over all your views, feelings, and conduct.
