<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> THAT to whom&s;oever to Live is CHRIST, to &s;uch Death will be Gain.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT the Apo&s;tle is here a&s;&s;ured of concerning him&s;elf, is true of others al&s;o in a like State and Condition. Such as Derive a Spiritual Life from CHRIST, and make it their great care to Live to the Glory of CHRIST, will find to their abundant Com|fort, that Death will be their Un&s;peakable Advantage. In Pro&s;ecuting this Doctrine</P>
<P>WE &s;hall</P>

<P N="1">I. <HI>WHAT is Implied in this Expre&s;&s;ion, To me to Live is CHRIST?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT Implies a Participation in his Life, being quickned and made alive unto GOD, by Virtue of His Powerful Grace, Efficaciou&s;ly work|ing in us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003122_0004_0FF0024EA8FF8F48">MAN in his Lap&s;ed State is naturally De&s;titute of Spiritual Life. Sin has Depri|ved him of it, That <HI>has &s;eparated between us and our GOD,</HI> I&s;a. LIX. 2. It has bro|ken that &s;pecial Union there was between GOD &amp; Man; (who &s;o long as that la&s;ted, was Ble&s;&s;ed with the Participation of a Spiritual and Divine Life, all tho&s;e Graces Spiritual, nece&s;&s;ary for his Holine&s;s &amp; Hap|pine&s;s) And at the &s;ame time has United &amp; Subjected him to another Head, the <HI>Prince that Rules in the Children of Di&s;obedience.</HI> But by CHRIST we have a Re-union, to GOD, in whom he accepts us, and gives us his I|mage. All we receive from GOD is con|veyed to us by and through CHRIST, for His &s;ake, and on His account. He being Con&s;tituted by Divine Appointment, as the Head of his Body the CHURCH And therefore this Benefit of a Spiritual Life is conveyed through and by Him. He is the Author of it,</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>AS He has Purcha&s;ed it for us.</HI> He has purcha&s;ed a Life for us at the Expence of HIS OWN. By the Sacrifice of his Death, he has Redeemed us from Death, &amp; Purcha&s;ed a Spiritual and Eternal Life for us <HI>He has Redeemed us from the Cur&s;e of the Law, being made a Cur&s;e for us,</HI> Gal. III. 13.
<PB N="6" REF="003122_0005_0FF002505F69C368">
<HI>We are bought with a Price,</HI> 1 Cor. VI. 20. And by Virtue of that Price, <HI>We are quickned together with him,</HI> Eph. II. 5.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>HE is &s;o as he Conveyeth this Life to us by the SPIRIT.</HI> He by the Spirit, quickens us with a Divine Life. It is the &s;pecial work of the Spirit to apply CHRIST, to carry on the Work&punc; he has begun in Redemption. Tho' he be of equal Glory with the FA|THER, &amp; SON, yet he Acts as from CHRIST, conveying Life in, and through, &amp; by Him. For <HI>CHRIST who has Life in Him&s;elf</HI> does Derive it to whom he will, <HI>John</HI> V. 21, 26. and <HI>John</HI> VI. 57. He acquired by his Merits on the Cro&s;s a right to &s;end, and promi&s;ed to &s;end the Spirit for this End. <HI>John</HI> XVI. 7, 13, 14, 15. CHRIST then is the Author of Spiritual Life; and this is the fir&s;t thing here intended, A Spiritual Union to Chri&s;t, whereby we receive Life from Him, and are made to live unto Him &amp; to GOD by Him.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT intends the Dedicating our &s;elves Un|re&s;ervedly and Sincerely to Him.</HI> The owning Him as our LORD, to whom all the Honour and Fruit of our Lives is Fir&s;tly and Pecu|liarly due. He is to be Practically acknow|ledged by us, as our rightful Owner and Lord. This was one End CHRIST aimed

at, in what he has Done and Suffered for us that he might acquire a new right to us, &amp; lay us under the mo&s;t engaging Obligations to him. Rom. XIV. 7, 8, 9. <HI>For none of us liveth to him&s;elf, and no Man dieth to him&s;elf. For whether we Live, we Live unto the LORD, and whether we Die, we Die unto the LORD. For to this End CHRIST both Died, &amp; Ro&s;e, and Revived, that he might be LORD both of the Dead and the Living.</HI> Our Duty is to Devote our &s;elves, our all to GOD, whatever may be u&s;eful to the Manife&s;tation of his Glory. This &s;eems to be what the Apo&s;tle had principally in his Eye, That if his Life were &s;till continued in the World, it &s;hould be employed in Serving and Glorifying CHRIST, He had cho&s;en Him for his LORD and Devoted him&s;elf to be his Con|&s;tant and Faithful Servant; and he would not Recede from his Re&s;olution, but Per&s;e|vere in a con&s;tant attendance to his Duty. When therefore Per&s;ons are either Glorify|ing GOD, in a Faithful attendance to the Duties of their General Calling, doing the work of Chri&s;tians, exerci&s;ing and growing in Grace, working out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling, or doing the Duties of their particular Calling in Obedience to CHRIST, filling up the Duties of their Places and Relations, in a Sub&s;erviency to the will

of CHRIST, This is to Live to CHRIST. This the &s;ame Apo&s;tle &s;hews us by his own Example, when he tells us, he valued not his Life for it Self, but for the Service which during the continuance of it he might do unto CHRIST. Acts XX. 24. <HI>Neither count I my Life Dear, &s;o that I may Fini&s;h my Cour&s;e with Joy,</HI> &amp;c. And then as our All, is with|out Re&s;erve to be Devoted to him, &s;o all is <HI>to be done Heartily and Sincerly</HI>: Not in pre|tence and appearance, but with a Real and Gracious bent of Heart. There are many make &s;hews of Honouring GOD, while they are only Serving of them&s;elves; Hence GOD &s;ays <HI>to them,</HI> Zech. VII. 5. <HI>When ye Fa&s;ted, Did ye do it at all to Me</HI>? So is it in any other Services, wherein Men make a fair Profe&s;&s;ion as if they had a Zeal for the Honour of CHRIST, and a de&s;ire to Promote it; when really their aim is no higher than Self. To Serve it way be a Spirit of Pride and O&s;ten|tation, or to bring about &s;ome Carnal De|&s;ign &amp; Intere&s;t. The&s;e &s;erve not CHRIST but them&s;elves in all they do. But GOD requires and expects an Upright Heart in all we do; Not only doing the things he requires of us, but the doing of them with Gracious Aims and Intentions, Eyeing His Glory in all we do, and doing all as in His &s;ight. Where there are &s;uitable Apprehen|&s;ions

of the Glorious Excellencies of CHRIST, a Sen&s;e how worthy He is to be &s;erved with our Be&s;t, &amp; the greate&s;t Affecti|on and Engagedne&s;s of Heart, it will teach us to Bani&s;h all Sine&s;ter re&s;pects, and make us upright before GOD, to do what He re|quires in a right manner, and to do every thing unto His Glory, <HI>As Ve&s;&s;els fitted for our Ma&s;ters &V;&s;e, and prepared unto every Good Work.</HI> 2 Tim.

<P N="2">II. TO &s;hew <HI>How Death is Gain to &s;uch.</HI> This may appear Strange to &s;uch as are Strangers to this Life of CHRIST, who judge of their Felicity by what is pre&s;ent and &s;en|&s;ible, and think That only makes to their Happine&s;s which &s;erves to their U&s;e, Com|fort and Delight in this pre&s;ent State; and therefore they count that which &s;eparates them from the&s;e things are Evil; yea the wor&s;t of Evils. To whom no wonder is it, <HI>if Death proves the King of Terrors.</HI> But this is a Truth every Believer will a&s;&s;ent to, tho' perhaps under the prevailings of Indwelling Sin, too much Carnality of Heart and Inor|dinacy of Affection to Carnal things, they are ready to &s;hrink from Death as an Enemy. But the certainty hereof will appear if we

Con&s;ider in what re&s;pects Death is Gain to a Believer.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS appears if <HI>we con&s;ider the Evils and Mi&s;eries, that &s;uch are hereby delivered from.</HI> This World is to Believers (as well as to others) a Vale of Tears; and upon ma|ny accounts more &s;o to them than to others. GOD never intended their Felicity and Portion here. They have here their Evil things, and hereafter they will have their Good things. In this <HI>Tabernacle they Groan, being Burthened,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> V. 4. But hereafter their Burthens &s;hall be Removed. They have <HI>Burthens here in com|mon with others</HI>; a Burthen of Care, Labour, Wearine&s;s, Bodily Pains, Weakne&s;s, and many Infirmities. The&s;e are Fruits of Sin, which GOD &s;ees nece&s;&s;ary for His own Chil|dren to be Exerci&s;ed with as well as others. But at their Death they find an End of all the&s;e. The Grave is a place of Re&s;t to the Body, and HEAVEN a place of Re&s;t to the Soul. <HI>Job</HI> III. 17. <HI>Rev.</HI> XIV. 13. And they have al&s;o their &s;hare in the <HI>common Calamities and Mi&s;eries,</HI> that GOD brings upon the World. They are a part of the Body and therefore &s;uffer with it. But at Death they are taken from this Community, and are delivered from the Burthens and Exerci&s;es

thereof, and <HI>Secured from the Evils to Come,</HI> I&s;a. LVII. 1, 2. Be&s;ides the&s;e <HI>there are Evils more peculiar to them</HI>; Others are under &s;ome of them indeed, but they don't feel them as &s;uch, and complain of them as their Mi&s;ery as they ought to do. The <HI>Activity and Power of Indwelling Sin,</HI> which &s;till re|mains in them is a great Exerci&s;e to them. By rea&s;on of it they are &s;o Clogged, Indi&s;po|&s;ed, and out of Frame and Unfit for any Holy &amp; Spiritual Actions &amp; Employments, that when <HI>they &s;hould do Good, Evil is Pre&s;ent</HI> with them. They are led into Captivity to the Law of Sin remaining in their Mem|bers. They are often Groaning under this, as their Burthen. Yea as a Burthen too heavy for them. P&s;al. XXXVIII. 3, 4, 6, 8. There is <HI>no Re&s;t in my Bones becau&s;e of my Sin. Mine Iniquities are gone over mine Head, as an Heavy Burden they are too Heavy for me. I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly; I go Mourning all the Day long. I am Feeble and Sore broken: I have Rored by rea&s;on of the Di&s;|quietne&s;s of my Heart.</HI> Rom. VII. 24 <HI>Oh Wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</HI> And by rea&s;on of this they often fail in their Duty to GOD and Man, and the be&s;t they do i&s; but imper|fectly done. But now they are through CHRIST made Victorious over this, it &s;hall

never Trouble them any more. This Body of Sin being de&s;troyed they are made Perfect. Here al&s;o they are Burthened with many <HI>Temptations and Trials,</HI> from <HI>Satan</HI> and <HI>the World.</HI> The World is a Place full of Snares; There are Temptations, and Exerci&s;es, in every Condition, in every Relation and Em|ployment. And Satan is a con&s;tant and re&s;tle&s;s Adver&s;ary, who is full of Malice, &amp; watches all Opportunities &s;eeking whom he may Devour, and tho' he can't De&s;troy yet he may and does greatly Afflict the People of GOD. He is often A&s;&s;aulting &amp; Buffet|ing them, &s;ometimes by Amazing Terrors, &s;ometimes by Helli&s;h In&s;inuations, &amp; Horrid Sugge&s;tions, that are enough to fill the Soul with Trembling Agonies and Dreadful Per|plexities. But now his Opportunities are over; he is &s;hut out of that place where the Souls of Believers are carried. Now they Rejoyce as having Conquered, yea they Tri|umph in CHRIST, being made Partakers of his Conque&s;t and Victory over Satan, &amp; the World. Be&s;ides &s;uch are more e&s;pecially expo&s;ed to <HI>the Reproaches</HI> and <HI>Injuries of the Wicked.</HI> The ungodly World hates them becau&s;e of their Love to CHRIST and their Faithfulne&s;s to Him. But Death &s;ets them free from this al&s;o. I &s;hall only add, They are here &s;ometimes exerci&s;ed <HI>with &s;ad De&s;er|tions,</HI>

and Heart <HI>oppre&s;&s;ing Fears,</HI> about <HI>their In|tere&s;t in the Covenant of GOD</HI> and the Hap|pine&s;s of Heaven. Many Dark Days pa&s;s over them in this State, wherein &s;uch Com|plaints are over heard from them as in P&s;al. XIII. at the beginning, <HI>How long will thou forget me, O LORD, for Ever? How long wilt thou hide thy Face from me? How long &s;hall I take Coun&s;el in my Soul, having Sorrow in my Heart daily</HI>? But now they are wholly delivered from the&s;e Exerci&s;es, they are no longer at a State of di&s;tance from, but pre|&s;ent with the LORD. Now their Souls Rejoyce in His Salvation, now they Sing unto the LORD becau&s;e He has dealt boun|tifully with them. <HI>This is the Exchange,</HI> Death makes for, and in a Believer, then &s;urely he is no Lo&s;er by it.</P>
<P N="2">2. DEATH is Gain to Believers, in that <HI>they then enter upon the Enjoyment of all Good.</HI> All Tears are then Wiped away from their Eyes, and they Drink of the Fulne&s;s of Joy. <HI>They Hunger no more, nor Thir&s;t any more, nor &s;hall the Sun light on them, nor any Heat.

When the Apo&s;tles had but a Glymp&s;e of this in His Transfiguration, Peter cries out <HI>it is good for us to be here,</HI> Mat. XVII. 4.

Here they have their Good things, but hereafter their Evil things; and Hence, while others are Comforted they are Tormented. To awaken &s;uch, and to excite their endeavours to get out of that mi&s;erable Condition where|in they are, Let them Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>THAT at Death they loo&s;e all their Worldly Comforts, and whatever was Service|able to them while they Lived.</HI> They have here many Mercies in common with others; many times as to the Gifts of Providence, they have as great a Share as any in the World, yea oftentimes a Greater.

<P N="2">(2) <HI>THE Chri&s;tle&s;s Sinner at Death loo&s;es all his Hopes.</HI> While he Lived, he often|times Ble&s;&s;ed his Soul, and Flattered him&s;elf with Hopes of going to Heaven when he left the World. There are many Carnal Confidences they are apt to Cheri&s;h, be|cau&s;e of their Priviledges, Profe&s;&s;ion, Vi&s;ible Relation to the People of GOD, Religious Duties they carried on, and &s;ome Reforma|tion and Strictne&s;s in their Lives, and U&s;e|fulne&s;s to the Publick But when Death Sei&s;es upon them all their Hopes are Da&s;hed and at an End.

<P N="3">(3) A Chri&s;tle&s;s Sinner at <HI>Death loo&s;es all his Opportunities to get a Change in his Condition.</HI> It is a Terrible time with a Sinner in this World when his Eyes are opened, and his Sins are &s;et in order before him, and he &s;ees the Wrath of GOD Impending him, &amp; all his Fal&s;e Confidences &s;truck out of his Hand He is as it were upon the Borders of Hell, and Terrors take hold on him. But tho' it be Sad, yet this is &s;ome Mitigation of it that there is hope his Condition may be altered. He yet enjoys a Day of Patience and Probation. GOD is waiting to be Gra|cious, there is a Po&s;&s;ibility of a Change tho' it be Hazardous and Uncertain. But now
<PB N="23" REF="003122_0013_0FF002634A4D8AF0">
in the ca&s;e before us, this is the Aggravation of it that the Day of Patience is at an End. Such are gone away from all Opportunities of Repenting and Returning to GOD. <HI>The Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e has ri&s;en and &s;hut to the Door.</HI> They have no more offers of Mercy, no more calls to Repentance. Time was when GOD did Invite, yea by His Mini&s;ters did Intreat Sinners to be Reconciled to Him; who have u&s;ed all Per&s;wa&s;ions &amp; Arguments they could, but they turned a Deaf Ear to all their Intreaties, and now Repentance is hid from the Eyes of their Judge, as before it was from then. The things of their Peace are Everla&s;tingly hid from their Eyes, be|cau&s;e they knew them not in the Day of their Vi&s;itation. Now no Cries or Intrea|ties will be regarded; CHRIST has &s;hut his Heart again&s;t them, and will be Favoura|ble to them no more. As in <HI>Prov.</HI> I. 24. &mdash; How much &s;oever the Sea&s;ons of Grace are undervalued now, the lo&s;s of them at that Day will be e&s;teemed an In&s;upporta|ble Mi&s;ery.</P>

XXV. 41. Mark IX. 44. They loo&s;e at this Hour all that was nece&s;&s;ary to their Souls Felicity. All Hopes of ever &s;eeing and enjoying GOD and CHRIST and Heaven for Ever. Who can conceive the Mi&s;ery of &s;uch a Lo&s;s, or apprehend the Dreadfulne&s;s of it! This is the dreadful Cata&s;trophe of a Chri&s;tle&s;s Sinner! Now he &s;lights the be&s;t Good, &amp; &s;ets his Heart and Affections upon Peri&s;hing Delights, and hereafter, he will loo&s;e all Good, yea his very Soul, and all the Happi|ne&s;s it is capable of, and in&s;tead of any De|light &amp; Comfort, be confined to Everla&s;ting Horrors &amp; Lamentations. How Infinitely does it concern them to Awake out of their Sleep, &amp; never be at Re&s;t till they &s;hall have obtained a Spiritual Life from CHRIST, that &s;o all the&s;e Evils may be Prevented?</P>

<P>THE Subject is High and Large, and which way &s;oever we take a View of him, we &s;hall find uncommon Excellencies, and not a little for our Admiration and Imitati|on.</P>
<P>WHAT of him fir&s;t took our Thoughts, was his Comely, Serene and Maje&s;tick A&s;pect, his Plea&s;ant, yet Grave and Solemn Deportment, every way becoming the great Excellencies of his Mind, always Comman|ding our Reverence, and Attracting our Love. Mo&s;t Happy was he in a Meek, Com|po&s;ed, Peaceable and Plea&s;ant Di&s;po&s;ition. He Excelled in a peculiar Sweetne&s;s and Goodne&s;s of Temper, and in a Beneficent Love to Mankind. This his Love mo&s;t Diffu&s;ive, tho' e&s;pecially directed to &s;uch where the Chri&s;tian appeared, yet led him to do Good to all, &amp; to the greate&s;t di&s;tance

from &s;peaking Evil of any. He was Hearty and Real in his Affection to his Friend, Faithful to his Intere&s;t, Obliging and Sincere in the Expre&s;&s;ions of his Friend&s;hip, and wholly Unpracti&s;ed in the Arts of Di&s;&s;imu|lation.</P>
<P>AND as he was by Nature of a Placid, Patient and Meek Spirit, &s;o he was by Grace much more &s;o. His Mind was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;tant Serenity, and his Brea&s;t with a Steady and Uninterrupted Calm, which &s;eemed wholly a Stranger to the Di&s;orders of Pa&s;&s;ion. The Heavenly Dew which falls not in a Storm, ever falling upon his Soul, always Calm and Serene with the Meeke&s;t Patience. That Wi&s;dom was Eminently di&s;covered in him, which is from above, <HI>which is fir&s;t Pure, then Peaceable, Gentle and Ea&s;y to be entreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality, and without Hypocri&s;y,</HI> James III. 17.</P>
<P>SUCH <HI>an Humility</HI> was always his Cloathing, as di&s;covered his Relation as a Di&s;ciple to the Lowly JESUS. His Con|ver&s;ation, his Behaviour, whatever he did, was mo&s;t Remote from Pride, and &s;pake pure Humility. Whoever &s;aw any thing in him Savouring of O&s;tentation, or ever Di&s;|covered the lea&s;t Envy to have had a Room

in his Heart? He had learned of CHRIST to be Meek and Lowly, and to make him|&s;elf of no Reputation, nor &s;eek the Honour that is of Man. He was truly a Man of Prayer, being much with GOD in that Duty, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;es upon Special concerns, of his quiet Waitings, and mighty Wre&s;tlings with GOD were &s;ometimes too Remarkable not to be ob&s;erved, and improved as En|couragements to keep alive that Spirit of Faith and Prayer that was &s;o Eminent in him.</P>
<P>AND if we follow him into his Hou&s;e we find a Generous, Kind and Obliging Ho&s;pitality, we there &s;ee the Tender and Dear Husband, the Careful and Loving Fa|ther, the Wi&s;e Governour of his Hou&s;hold, where nothing Indecent or Extravagant could find a Room, making <HI>his Hou&s;e a Bethel</HI> by the con&s;tant and exact maintaining the Wor&s;hip of GOD in it, and a School of Piety, in the Religious Education of all un|der his care.

<P>HE Lived always as under the Eye and Awe of the Great GOD, to whom he was to give account of the Great Charge com|mitted to him; and Laboured therein as one Ab&s;olutely Devoted to the Service and Intere&s;t of CHRIST. He under&s;tood his Work and had a Lively &s;en&s;e of the Worth of Souls; and the bringing Glory to GOD, in being an In&s;trument to Promote the Salva|tion of Sinners by CHRIST, was his chief his only Ambition, and this Swallowed up all his Thoughts and Talents. The Con|ver&s;ion of Sinners was the Great thing he aimed at, he was moved with Compa&s;&s;ion for them in their Mi&s;ery, and Laboured their Awakening, to Shoot his Arrows into their Hearts <HI>and Effect a Trembling Sen&s;e of their being in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s, and Bonds of Iniquity,</HI> having no part in the Pardon of their Sins, or the Hopes of Glory, and a <HI>thorough Humiliation</HI> of Soul before GOD; that they might be prepared for the Enter|tainment
