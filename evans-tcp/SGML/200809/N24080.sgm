<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the &s;ubject here di&s;cu&s;&s;ed is of &s;ufficient importance to demand &s;erious attention, whether the principle defended be true or fal&s;e, mu&s;t be admitted by every competent judge; becau&s;e of its intimate connec|tion with the doctrine of ju&s;tification before God: for that has ever been con&s;idered, by our mo&s;t eminent Prote&s;tant writers, both Lutherans and Calvini&s;ts, as an article of the greate&s;t moment. Thus, for in&s;tance, Dr. JOHN OWEN:
<Q>In my judgment, LUTHER &s;pake the truth when he &s;aid, <HI>To lo&s;e the article of Ju&s;tifica|tion, would at once be the lo&s;s of the whole Chri&s;tian faith.</HI> And I wi&s;h he had not been a true prophet, when he foretold that, in the following ages, the doc|trine hereof would be again ob&s;cured <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Doctrine of Ju&s;tification. General Con&s;idertions,</HI> p. 103. Gla&s;|gow, 1760. Thus, al&s;o, that celebrated foreigner, WITSIUS:
<Q>Diffundit &s;e Ju&s;tificationis doctrina per totum theologiae corpus, et prout fundamenta hic, vel bene, vel male, jacta &s;unt, eo uni ver&s;um aedi&s;icium vel &s;olidius augu&s;tiu&s;que a&s;cendit, vel male &s;tatuminatum foedam minitatur ruinam.</Q>

al&s;o, with Chri&s;tian experience, with devotional practice, and with general obedience to God. The better that principle is under&s;tood, and the more its practical influence is felt; the more benign will its genuine tendency appear, with regard to peace of con|&s;cience, and liberty in devotional duties; to the habi|tual exerci&s;e of holy affections, and a cour&s;e of confor|mity to the divine commands. It is, by the Author at lea&s;t, con&s;idered in this light.</P>
<P>That prudence and caution are nece&s;&s;ary, however, in &s;tating and defending the &s;entiment here adopted, the Writer pre&s;umes, will be acknowledged: becau&s;e it is a kind of <HI>middle point,</HI> between Arminiani&s;m, and Antinomiani&s;m&mdash;between &s;eeking acceptance with God, <HI>as it were, by the works of the law</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. ix. 32.</NOTE>; and renouncing obedience to the divine precepts, as if they had lo&s;t their obliging power, or as if our per&s;onal obedience were of no importance in any re&s;pect. The former of which is pernicious legality; the latter, de&s;tructive licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s. Whether the Writer have handled the &s;ub|ject with all that wi&s;dom and care, which its delicacy and importance demand, he dares not a&s;&s;ert: but, with &s;incerity he can declare, that the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of it has been attended with much thought, and with frequent prayer.</P>
<P><PB REF="031844_0004_0FEF1CC849D8D408">Though the Author dete&s;t the <HI>real</HI> principles of what is properly called <HI>Antinomiani&s;m;</HI> though, many years ago, in the mo&s;t public manner, he laboured to explode tho&s;e pernicious principles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>The Death of Legal Hope, the Life of Evangelical Obedi|ence,</HI> Sect. VII. Edit. 3d.</NOTE>; and though, in the pre&s;ent Performance, he have endeavoured to guard again&s;t being mi&s;under&s;tood; yet he is not without &s;u&s;picion, that &s;ome of his readers will be ready to con&s;ider the main po&s;ition defended, as having a licentious ca&s;t. But, &s;hould that be the ca&s;e, he is prepared for it, &s;o as to be neither offended, nor &s;urpri&s;ed. Nay, while fully per&s;uaded that there is no ju&s;t ground for &s;uch a conclu|&s;ion, he will con&s;ider it as a pre&s;umption in favour of the point maintained. Becau&s;e it is evident, that the doctrine of grace, as preached and recorded by Paul, was treated in a &s;imilar manner <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 8, 31. vi. 1, 2, 3, 15. ix. 14&mdash;24.</NOTE>. He has long been of opinion, that whoever exhibits the <HI>true glory</HI> of divine grace, and the <HI>high importance</HI> of Chri&s;tian duty, accord|ing to the apo&s;tolic pattern; will be con&s;idered by many as an Antinomian, and by &s;ome as an Arminian. Does a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel di&s;play the ab&s;olute freene&s;s, the infinite riches, and the all&s;ufficiency of that grace which is revealed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as an immediate ground of encouragement for the vile&s;t of &s;inners to confide in him? the doctrine will be &s;tigmatized by
<PB N="vi" REF="031844_0005_0FEF1CCB2E9CDC80">
multitudes, as manife&s;tly licentious. Does he, as mini|&s;terial duty requires, warmly in&s;i&s;t, that, be the profe&s;&s;ed articles of any one's theological creed ever &s;o &s;criptural; yet, if he be not habitually mindful of the divine precepts; if he keep not the example of Chri&s;t in view; if his heart have not an heavenly turn; he is a &s;tranger to the power of evangelical truth, and unworthy to be called a Chri&s;tian? his preaching will be offen&s;ive to the mere formali&s;t; be cen&s;ured as uncharitable; and reproached, by &s;ome, as dete&s;tably legal.</P>
<P>The grand principle here defended, is far from being novel; it having been adopted by many Prote&s;tant writers of high reputation in the churches of Chri&s;t: from &s;ome of whom, and e&s;pecially from Dr. JOHN OWEN, a number of quotations appear in the following work. To the producing of which quotations the Author was induced, partly for the &s;ake of that argument which they contain, in proof of his main point; and partly to evince, that the &s;entiments here maintained have been e&s;pou&s;ed by per&s;ons of the fir&s;t eminence, among profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians of Calvini&s;tic principles.</P>
<P>That the number of quotations, from the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable Calvini&s;tic authors, with regard to the leading po&s;ition, might have been greatly increa&s;ed; every one, much acquainted with their theological writings, mu&s;t acknowledge. Mr. DAVID WILSON, when vindicating

various Writers, denominated POPULAR PREACHERS, again&s;t the attacks of gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation, of illiberal cen&s;ure, and of &s;arca&s;tical contempt; in &s;peaking rela|tive to the main &s;ubject of the following pages, &s;ays:
<Q>They [the Popular Preachers] were very ready to acknowledge, that tho&s;e who are mo&s;t punctual in the external performance of religious duties, are frequently in a far more dangerous condition than publicans and harlots, or tho&s;e who lead the mo&s;t wicked and flagi|tious lives; becau&s;e, through the corruption of their own hearts, all their duties, religious &s;ervices, endea|vours and attainments, are too often made &s;ub&s;ervient to the gratification of their pride, and the cheri&s;hing of tho&s;e pre&s;umptuous hopes and imaginations whereby they are hardened in their oppo&s;ition to the true grace of God manife&s;ted in the go&s;pel. And they were equally ready to own, that the &s;overeign mercy of God, with regard to believers at fir&s;t conver&s;ion, does &s;till prevent every good action, motion, or qualifica|tion in them; every thing that can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have the lea&s;t tendency to qualify them for the divine ap|probation &mdash;They affirmed, that the foundation of a &s;inner's confidence and comfort lies, not in any good works performed by him; in any con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own &s;incerity; or any experience of a gracious and &s;anctifying work of the divine Spirit upon his own &s;oul; but wholly without him, in the promi&s;es and te&s;timony of God in the go&s;pel&mdash;To maintain, that

<P>Though the Author be fully per&s;uaded, that a denial of the po&s;ition maintained, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the ge|nuine go&s;pel, and with tho&s;e principles on which every truly pious man proceeds in his prayers, re&s;pecting ac|ceptance with God; yet he is far from concluding, that no one is a real di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, who does not expli|citly avow that po&s;ition. For he has learned, from experience and ob&s;ervation, that per&s;ons will &s;ometimes <HI>di&s;pute</HI> again&s;t a particular &s;entiment, the truth of which is habitually implied in their <HI>prayers,</HI> and its importance

tacitly acknowledged in their <HI>own experience.</HI> To this effect is the following language of Dr. OWEN, re&s;pecting certain oppo&s;ers of the doctrine of ju&s;tification merely by grace, through an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s:

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHETHER any holy di&s;po&s;ition in the heart of a &s;inner be previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to warrant his believing in Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Or, whether, for that purpo&s;e, the go&s;pel it&s;elf, detached from every con&s;ideration of a pre|paratory &s;anctifying influence, be completely &s;ufficient? are que&s;tions on which the mini&s;ters of religion, and the profe&s;&s;ors of godline&s;s, are greatly divided. The <HI>for|mer</HI> &s;entiment is charged, by &s;ome, with Arminian legality: the <HI>latter,</HI> by multitudes, with Antinomian licentiou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>That</HI> is di&s;carded, as fo&s;tering phari|&s;aical pride, as veiling the glory of &s;overeign grace, and as corrupting the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>This</HI> is dete&s;ted, as encouraging pre&s;umptuous hope, as inimical to true virtue, and as aver&s;e to Supreme authority, expre&s;&s;ing it&s;elf in divine law. So oppo&s;ite are the views of pro|fe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="14" REF="031844_0012_0FEF1CE18887B358">
Chri&s;tians, relative to this momentous article of our enquiry!</P>
<P>After much thought on the &s;ubject, I cannot but conclude, however, <HI>That the genuine go&s;pel is a complete warrant for the mo&s;t ungodly per&s;on to believe in Je&s;us; and that no degree of holine&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e.</HI> This po&s;ition, though treated by great numbers as a licentious principle, and as pregnant with dangerous con&s;equences, I con&s;ider as a capital article of revealed truth, and as e&s;&s;ential to the genuine go&s;pel. I adopt it, as expre&s;&s;ing an important fact, in which the perfec|tion of our Lord's vicarious work, the honour of divine grace, and the peace of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed con&s;ciences, are deeply concerned: to the proof and illu&s;tration of which, the following pages are devoted.</P>
<P>To prevent mi&s;takes it is proper to be ob&s;erved, that, by an <HI>holy di&s;po&s;ition</HI> is not meant, a &s;peculative know|ledge of religious duty; a conviction of &s;piritual danger; or a de&s;ire of immortal happine&s;s: for the&s;e, though they accompany, do none of them come under the notion of an holy di&s;po&s;ition. The&s;e may all exi&s;t, more or le&s;s, in the minds, the con&s;ciences, and the hearts of &s;inners, without any principle of true &s;anctity. But, by an holy di&s;po&s;ition is intended, a <HI>bias</HI> of the will, a <HI>propen&s;ity</HI> of the heart, or a <HI>tendency</HI> of the affec|tions, in favour of divine authority, and of conformity
<PB N="15" REF="031844_0013_0FEF1CE30DC36448">
to the divine image.&mdash;By <HI>believing</HI> in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I do not mean a firm per&s;ua&s;ion of his being the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, and that the Chri&s;tian religion is from God, though that per&s;ua&s;ion be pre&s;uppo&s;ed; nor a mere a&s;&s;ent to any particular propo&s;ition, however true, or important; nor yet an a&s;&s;urance of per&s;onal intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, as the only Saviour of &s;inners: but <HI>relying</HI> upon him as revealed in the doctrine of grace, for pardon, peace, and every &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Again: The que&s;tion is not, whether &s;anctifying influence, and real holine&s;s, be previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>final felicity?</HI> for that is admitted in its fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e. Partly, becau&s;e <HI>without holine&s;s no one &s;hall &s;ee the Lord;</HI> and partly, becau&s;e without holine&s;s, intellectual hap|pine&s;s is impo&s;&s;ible,&mdash;Neither is the inquiry, Whether a pious turn of heart be nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>communion with God,</HI> in the performance of devotional &s;ervices? for that com|munion, on the part of a Chri&s;tian, is nothing el&s;e but the exerci&s;e of holy affections toward God, as manife&s;t|ing him&s;elf in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;Nor, whether an holy ten|dency in the will be nece&s;&s;ary, as an evidence of our <HI>having already</HI> believed in Je&s;us? for that is cheerfully granted.&mdash;Nor, yet, whether a divine influence, attend|ing evangelical truth, be nece&s;&s;ary to a &s;inner's <HI>believing</HI> in Chri&s;t? for that is an important article of the Chri&s;|tian faith.&mdash;But the que&s;tion to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, is; <HI>Whe|ther the Go&s;pel it&s;elf be a complete warrant for the mo&s;t
<PB N="16" REF="031844_0014_0FEF1CB9898A5260">
ungodly per&s;on to believe in Je&s;us, without any holy di&s;po|&s;ition being nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e?</HI></P>
<P>By the term <HI>go&s;pel</HI> I here intend, <HI>the doctrine of &s;al|vation by grace, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> which doctrine is, in the mo&s;t emphatical &s;en&s;e, <HI>good news,</HI> or <HI>glad tidings;</HI> agreeable to the natural import of the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, as u&s;ed by the Evangeli&s;ts and Apo&s;tles. Relative to which particular, I will here introduce a few extracts from Dr. GEORGE CAMPBELL. Thus, that learned Author:
<Q>This term, (<GAP DESC="foreign">) agree|ably to its etymology, from <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>bene</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>nuncium,</HI> always in cla&s;&s;ical u&s;e, where it occurs but rarely, denotes either <HI>good news,</HI> or the <HI>reward</HI> given to the bearer of good news&mdash;The Greek verb <GAP DESC="foreign">, when fir&s;t u&s;ed by the Evangeli&s;ts,&mdash;conveyed to their coun|trymen only one and the &s;ame idea, which is preci&s;ely what the phra&s;e <HI>to bring good tidings</HI> conveys to us. The appropriation of the word to the religious in&s;ti|tution called the go&s;pel, is of later date, and has gradu|ally ari&s;en out of the former u&s;age. When etymology and u&s;e perfectly coincide, we cannot be too literal in our interpretations; when they differ, which does not &s;eldom happen, the latter is to be followed, and not the former&mdash;The fir&s;t meaning of the word (<GAP DESC="foreign">) then in the New Te&s;tament, e&s;pecially in the Go&s;pels, is, as has been ob&s;erved, <HI>good news</HI>; a &s;ignification which, though always implied, is not always what is
<PB N="17" REF="031844_0015_0FEF1CEBEE64C138">
chiefly intended: and therefore the word cannot, without a &s;acrifice of propriety, be uniformly &s;o ren|dered. The name, from being expre&s;&s;ive of an eminent quality in the di&s;pen&s;ation introduced by the Me&s;&s;iah, and from being mo&s;t frequently applied to it, came gradually to &s;erve as a name for the di&s;pen&s;ation it&s;elf. When it is thus employed, it is in our tongue properly rendered <HI>go&s;pel</HI>&mdash;This [literal and primitive] &s;en&s;e ought to be retained in the ver&s;ion, when the word, <GAP DESC="foreign"> is con&s;trued with a noun &s;erving to limit or explain its nature; as <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the good news of peace;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the good news of the reign.</HI> It was ob&s;erved, on the explanation of the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, that the Chri&s;tian economy was foretold under the denomination of <HI>the reign of God,</HI> and <HI>the reign of Heaven;</HI> and I may add, in the typical lan|guage of the P&s;alms, <HI>the reign of David</HI>&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign">, is <HI>the good news of the favour of God:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the good news of your &s;alvation.</HI> The words in the common ver&s;ion, <HI>the go&s;pel of your &s;alvation,</HI> are mere words, and con|vey no meaning to Engli&s;h ears.

Thus that
<PB N="21" REF="031844_0019_0FEF1CF6985589B8">
eminent writer:
<Q>The <HI>law,</HI> here, denotes that part of the divine Word which con&s;i&s;ts of precepts and pro|hibitions; with the promi&s;e of a reward to be conferred on tho&s;e who obey, and a threatening of puni&s;hment on the di&s;obedient. The <HI>go&s;pel</HI> &s;ignifies the doctrine of grace, and of complete &s;alvation in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which elect &s;inners &s;hall receive by faith. Every pre|&s;cription, therefore, of virtues and of duties; all exhor|tations and dehortations; all reproofs and threatenings; all promi&s;es, likewi&s;e, of reward to perfect obedience, belong to the <HI>law.</HI> To the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> pertains every thing that can mini&s;ter hope of &s;alvation to &s;inful man: that is, the doctrine of the Per&s;on, the offices, the &s;tates, the benefits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and all promi&s;es to which are annexed the pardon of &s;in, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of grace and of glory, to be obtained by faith in Chri&s;t. This is the mo&s;t &s;trict notion of each word; to which, through the whole of this di&s;putation, regard mu&s;t be paid&mdash;If we under&s;tand the word <HI>go&s;pel</HI> &s;trictly, as it is the <HI>formula</HI> of the Te&s;tament of Grace, which con|&s;i&s;ts of mere promi&s;es, or an ab&s;olute exhibition of &s;al|vation in Chri&s;t; then, properly &s;peaking, it pre&s;cribes nothing as duty; requires nothing; commands nothing: no, not even <HI>believe, tru&s;t, hope in the Lord,</HI> and &s;uch like. But it reports, declares, and &s;ignifies to us, what God in Chri&s;t promi&s;es; what he will do, and is about to perform. All pre&s;cription of duty belongs to the <HI>law;</HI> as, after others, the venerable VOETIUS has

&mdash;This di&s;tinc|tion between the <HI>law</HI> and the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> &s;trictly under&s;tood, appearing to be both ju&s;t and important, is regarded in the following pages.</P>
<P>Still further, however, to confirm and illu&s;trate the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping this di&s;tinction in view, it may be ob&s;erved; that the <HI>law</HI> of God originated in his relation to men, as moral agents; and in his nece&s;&s;ary dominion over them, of which it is a natural expre&s;&s;ion: but the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> in his royal, &s;upreme prerogative; it being the re&s;ult of his mere, &s;overeign plea&s;ure. The <HI>former</HI> con&s;iders them as rational creatures that are bound to obey: the <HI>latter,</HI> as guilty creatures, who de&s;erve to &s;uffer. The precepts of divine <HI>law</HI> are the language of &s;tern autho|rity: the doctrines of the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> are the voice of conde|&s;cending mercy. In <HI>that,</HI> ju&s;tice un&s;heaths the &s;word, and demands vengeance: in <HI>this,</HI> mercy exhibits pardon, and proclaims peace.

God, in the <HI>law,</HI> addre&s;&s;es men agreeably to their per|&s;onal de&s;erts, their character, and their &s;tate: in the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> according to the riches of his own grace, the diver&s;ity of their &s;piritual wants, and the vicarious work of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. In divine <HI>law,</HI> the Mo&s;t High exhi|bits him&s;elf, as inve&s;ted with ab&s;olute dominion, as flaming with eternal purity, and as unchangeably abhor|rent of moral evil: in the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> as <HI>condemning &s;in in the fle&s;h</HI> of his own incarnate Son <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 3.</NOTE>; as <HI>pardoning iniquity,</HI> in its greatly diver&s;ified forms; as <HI>ju&s;tifying the ungodly;</HI> as <HI>the</HI> JUST <HI>God and the</HI> SAVIOUR <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7.

<P>Hence it appears, that, in addre&s;&s;ing &s;inners, re&s;pecting their immortal concerns, neither the announcing of dan|ger, nor the enforcing of duty, is publi&s;hing the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> properly &s;o called. Becau&s;e it is admitted by all, who are conver&s;ant in the&s;e things, that <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> denotes <HI>glad tidings.</HI> Such is its natural and proper, its delightful and emphatical meaning. It is mo&s;t com|monly employed, in the New Te&s;tament, with an imme|diate reference to the grace of God, and the work of Chri&s;t, as they appear in the &s;alvation of &s;inners. Very &s;eldom is it u&s;ed by the Apo&s;tles, to denote the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem <HI>at large</HI>; but, with a few exceptions, in its grand,
<PB N="24" REF="031844_0022_0FEF1D00E54A91E0">
appropriate, and emphatical &s;en&s;e, for that part of revealed truth which re&s;pects the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;alvation, by mere grace, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Preaching the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> therefore, is proclaiming <HI>glad tidings</HI> of &s;alvation for the guilty, the unworthy, and the peri&s;hing.</P>
<P>Now, the terms <HI>law, precepts, commands, exhortations, threatenings,</HI> and others of a &s;imilar kind, are expre&s;&s;ions of an extremely different meaning, from that of the word <HI>go&s;pel.</HI> To a&s;&s;ert, therefore, the authority of God in his laws, whether moral or po&s;itive; to de&s;cribe the awful &s;ituation of unregenerate &s;inners? to warn them of their extreme danger; to inculcate, for &s;uitable pur|po&s;es, an impartial regard to all the divine precepts; and to in&s;i&s;t, that an habitual want of obedience to the known commands of Chri&s;t, leaves a per&s;on de&s;titute of evidence that he either loves him, or believes in him; though of <HI>e&s;&s;ential importance,</HI> in the cour&s;e of a public mini&s;try, ought never to be con&s;idered, &s;trictly &s;peaking, as preaching <HI>the go&s;pel.</HI> It may be all true; it may be all proper; it may be all nece&s;&s;ary in its place; and yet, not having the nature of <HI>glad tidings</HI> in it, be very different from the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The word <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> having long been commonly u&s;ed without any determinate meaning; except, either a denoting the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, or &s;ome doctrine, or precept, pertaining to Chri&s;tianity; and having become, by modern u&s;e, a kind of technical term in divinity; is
<PB N="25" REF="031844_0023_0FEF1D027617AFD0">
applied, in the mo&s;t promi&s;cuous manner, to all &s;orts of religious doctrine, that are con&s;idered by their abettorn as warranted in the &s;acred writings. The public mini&s;ter, and the private profe&s;&s;or, whatever their theological creed may be; are equally plea&s;ed with concluding, that the one preaches, and the other hears, the <HI>go&s;pel:</HI> though, frequently, neither of them have any fixed or di&s;tinct notion under the term; and even though their views of Chri&s;tianity render it nearly akin to Dei&s;m. It were to be wi&s;hed, therefore, either that, in&s;tead of the old Saxon word <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> the expre&s;&s;ions <HI>glad tidings</HI> had been u&s;ed in our vulgar tran&s;lation of the New Te&s;ta|ment; or that the former term were univer&s;ally under|&s;tood in its original &s;en&s;e, as denoting <HI>good news.</HI> For, were that the ca&s;e, it is highly probable, there would be more knowledge, and le&s;s of &s;elf-deception; relative to this momentous affair.</P>

<P>It is hence apparent, that God, in the be&s;towment of ble&s;&s;ings on the children of men, is not influenced by the purity of their hearts, the piety of their lives, or the worthine&s;s of their characters; but by a regard to his own eternal perfection; to the &s;upreme excellence of his own revealed Name; and to the everla&s;ting honour of his own immen&s;e goodne&s;s. No: the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;alvation, on whom&s;oever conferred, are never to be con&s;idered as di&s;tingui&s;hing worth, and rewarding merit; but as de&s;igned to di&s;play the riches of divine mercy, and the glory of the divine character, by relieving the wretched, and &s;aving the unworthy.&mdash;Now, the Divine Maje&s;ty having revealed him&s;elf as exerci&s;ing mercy, and granting &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, for his <HI>own &s;ake;</HI> the polluted, ungodly, and peri&s;hing &s;inner is completely warranted to rely on that mercy, as manife&s;ted in the atonement, for pardon, acceptance, and peace, inde|pendent of every other con&s;ideration. This perfectly &s;uits, not only the apo&s;tate &s;tate of man, but the peerle&s;s maje&s;ty of God. For as he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of boundle&s;s Being; as all creatures received their exi&s;tence from
<PB N="53" REF="031844_0050_0FEF1D545DBBF428">
his power, and are entirely dependent on his plea&s;ure; and as the &s;um total of all created exi&s;tence is but an atom, in compari&s;on with him; &s;o he acts perfectly agreeable to his own character, in making him&s;elf the ultimate end of his whole conduct, and in all things con&s;ulting his own glory.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ages here produced, being all extracted from the Old Te&s;tament, are quite &s;uitable to that revelation which God made of him&s;elf under the Jewi&s;h Oeconomy; and to the import of his name JEHOVAH, by which he made him&s;elf known to the cho&s;en tribes. For that Name was, in a peculiar manner, <HI>his</HI> OWN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. vi. 2, 3.

The &s;entiment, therefore, which is conveyed by this contra&s;ted form of expre&s;&s;ion, is to be con&s;idered as a <HI>grand principle</HI> of the apo&s;tolic doctrine; and this mode of &s;peaking, as the current language of In&s;piration, relative to tho&s;e capital ble&s;&s;ings, election, conver&s;ion, pardon, and ju&s;tification.</P>

<P>WHEN a &s;inner is burdened with guilt, and filled with apprehen&s;ions of eternal ruin, his language is, '<HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI> or, <HI>How &s;hall I e&s;cape the wrath to come?</HI> Being ignorant of that righteou&s;ne&s;s which the go&s;pel reveals for the ju&s;tification of the ungodly, he labours to obtain acceptance with God by his own efforts: till, being better acquainted with the purity of the law, the holine&s;s of God, and the corruption of his own heart, he de&s;pairs of being ju&s;tified by the works of the law.</P>
<P>To a per&s;on thus convinced of &s;in, and apprehen&s;ive of danger, one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the glad tidings of &s;overeign grace, and the doctrine of complete &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t for the chief of &s;inners, would be embraced with all po&s;&s;ible readine&s;s. Experience and ob&s;ervation prove, however, that awakened &s;inners are frequently backward to receive encouragement from the glorious go&s;pel. This ari&s;es, not from any defect in the grace it proclaims, or in the &s;alvation it brings; not becau&s;e

the alarmed &s;inner is under any nece&s;&s;ity, or in any di&s;tre&s;s, for which it does not reveal complete relief; but becau&s;e he does not behold the glory of that grace which reigns triumphantly in it, and the de&s;ign of God in making the rich provi&s;ion. He wants to find him&s;elf &s;ome way <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hed</HI> from others, as a proper object of mercy, by holy tempers and &s;anctified affections. This is his grand embarra&s;&s;ment.

Yes, whether the condition pre&s;cribed be greater or le&s;s, the punctual performance of it mu&s;t give a legal title to all the ble&s;&s;ings annexed to that condition: which, in the ca&s;e before us, would be to obtain ju&s;tifi|cation by the works of the law.&mdash;As the qualification for obtaining an <HI>intere&s;t in Chri&s;t,</HI> or a participation of his benefits?

<P>As we cannot conceive of holine&s;s exi&s;ting in any creature, that is entirely de&s;titute of love to God; nor of God being loved by any creature, that does not know him; &s;o, neither will the Scriptures permit us to conclude, that any of Adam's degenerate offspring ever knew and loved the true God, <HI>except as revealed in the Mediator.</HI> Nor will the Bible warrant our &s;uppo&s;ing, that &s;inners ever love the Supreme; or that they cordi|ally approve the true character of God; before they believe in Chri&s;t, as exhibited in the go&s;pel. <HI>There is forgivene&s;s with Thee, that thou maye&s;t be feared&mdash;We love Him, becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us.</HI> For though he de&s;erve the profounde&s;t reverence, and the warme&s;t

<P>If, by an awakened &s;inner, it be admitted as a fact, and believed as a doctrine, that no one is authori&s;ed to depend on Chri&s;t for pardon and peace, until po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an holy di&s;po&s;ition; he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be more &s;olicitous to find evidence of that important requi&s;ite exi&s;ting in his heart, than to under&s;tand and believe what the go&s;pel &s;ays concerning Chri&s;t. For &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion mu&s;t unavoidably direct his attention to the virtuous inclinations he de&s;ires to feel, and the righteous works he wi&s;hes to perform; rather than to the riches of revealed mercy, and to the all &s;ufficiency of the Redeemer's work. This mode of proceeding mu&s;t, therefore, while it fo&s;ters his legal pride, embarra&s;s his pained con&s;cience: which effects are equally foreign from the genius of evangelical doctrine, and from the nature of true faith.</P>
<P>Our Lord, not being the Saviour of man, as <HI>man;</HI> or of man, as <HI>holy</HI>; but of man, as <HI>depraved, guilty,</HI> and <HI>condemned</HI>; it apparently follows, from the nature of the ca&s;e, that if Chri&s;t, under his graciou&s;ly &s;aving character, ever be regarded at all, in a way of depen|dence; the &s;inner mu&s;t, in his fir&s;t application to him, con&s;ider him&s;elf as totally ba&s;e and worthle&s;s.

did he po&s;&s;e&s;s the lea&s;t degree of true &s;anctity, that would be a fal&s;e e&s;timate of his own character.

<PB N="89" REF="031844_0086_0FEF1DC50F2E8150">
that his notions were &s;elfrighteous, and his hope delu&s;ive. But if, previous to believing in Chri&s;t, and in order to warrant a dependence upon him, there mu&s;t be an holy turn of heart; why &s;hould the per&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed fall under a &s;u&s;picion &s;o har&s;h? If it be a fact, that none but tho&s;e who are previou&s;ly born of God, and &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to keep his commands, are encou|raged, by the go&s;pel, to believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; it cannot be either unlawful, or improper, from them, under that <HI>very character and con&s;ideration,</HI> to place their fir&s;t reliance upon him.

<P>The principle again&s;t which I contend implies, that &s;inners mu&s;t be <HI>cordially reconciled</HI> to the true character of God, as revealed in the Mediator, before they rely on Chri&s;t, and before they believe the go&s;pel.

<P>It was the de&s;ign of our Lord, in his admirable para|ble of the Prodigal, and in that of the Publican <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke xv. 11&mdash;32. xviii. 10&mdash;14.</NOTE>, to inform us, Under what <HI>character,</HI> or under what <HI>con&s;i|deration</HI> of our&s;elves, we mu&s;t apply to God for pardon, for peace, and for &s;alvation. What, then, are the mo&s;t prominent features of tho&s;e two parabolical per&s;ons, when viewed as coming to God for acceptance? The Prodigal appears as a ragged, filthy, &s;tarving wretch; who, impelled by mere nece&s;&s;ity, returns to his Father, without any recommendation of per&s;on, or of character; and as de&s;erving to be for ever exheridated. The Publican, &s;mitten with a &s;en&s;e of enormous guilt; far from con&s;idering him&s;elf as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any holy di&s;po|&s;ition; and harra&s;&s;ed with apprehen&s;ions of eternal ruin; appears as a criminal who de&s;erves to be damned, and who dares not lift up his eyes to heaven, even when <HI>he cries for mercy</HI> through an atonement. Surely, then, the&s;e characters, and the &s;cope of the&s;e parables, are far from teaching, that &s;inners mu&s;t have &s;ome degree of holine&s;s before they be authori&s;ed to believe in Je&s;us.&mdash; Nay, in the parable of the <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> and the <HI>Publican,</HI>

not cen&s;ured, merely becau&s;e he thanked God for <HI>the difference</HI> which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him&s;elf, and the profli|gate part of the world; but becau&s;e he placed that differ|ence to the account of his <HI>ju&s;tification before God.</HI> In <HI>that</HI> re&s;pect, the cha&s;te lady, and the vile pro&s;titute; the mo&s;t virtuous characters, and the greate&s;t profligates, are completely on a level; having only one common ground of hope&mdash;<HI>the vicarious obedience of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t, I think, be granted, that when a &s;inner fir&s;t believes in Je&s;us, he is concerned chiefly about pardon and acceptance with God. But, if &s;o, the &s;pirit of tho&s;e in&s;tructive parables to which I advert, ab&s;olutely forbids our &s;uppo&s;ing, that any degree of holine&s;s is required of a &s;inner, to warrant his dependence on Chri&s;t. We will, however, for the &s;ake of argument, admit the contrary. We will &s;uppo&s;e that a &s;inner, under a per&s;ua&s;ion of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome degree of true &s;anctity, applies to the glorious Je&s;us; and that he addre&s;&s;es God in prayer, for ju&s;tification, agreeably to this view of him&s;elf. What, then, will be the &s;pirit of his addre&s;s at the throne of Eternal Maje&s;ty? Mu&s;t it not, either expre&s;sly or implicitly, be as follows?
<Q><HI>God, I thank thee, that I am not</HI> as the multitude of <HI>other men!</HI> Once, indeed, I lived in di&s;obedience, and loved &s;in: but now it is otherwi&s;e, as to the turn of my heart, and the cour&s;e of my life. Having a pious di&s;po&s;ition, my will is under an holy bias; which leads
<PB N="117" REF="031844_0114_0FEF1E19C7009E28">
me to revere thy authority, and to keep thy commands. Thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the requi&s;ite divinely pre&s;cribed to all tho&s;e that would acceptably believe in Je&s;us, and through his merits obtain ju&s;tification; I cannot doubt, either of acceptance with thee, or of admi&s;&s;ion into thy eternal kingdom.</Q>
&mdash;This, or &s;omething &s;imilar, is the genuine language of every one who, in his devotional addre&s;&s;es relative to <HI>ju&s;tification,</HI> proceeds on that ungra|cious principle which I oppo&s;e! There is rea&s;on to think, however, that many who warmly <HI>di&s;pute</HI> for the principle, entirely de&s;ert it in <HI>prayer;</HI> and would even be &s;hocked to hear a religious addre&s;s to the Deity, re&s;pecting ju&s;tification, formed upon it.&mdash;But, if the principle in que&s;tion be an article of divine truth, it mu&s;t be of great importance: for it enters deeply into the doctrine of ju&s;tification. Why &s;hould it not, then, by all that embrace it, be avowed in their &s;olemn prayers for pardon and acceptance, e&s;pecially by tho&s;e who, with the Phari&s;ee, con&s;ider them&s;elves as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the requi&s;ite holine&s;s? Why does it not make a con&s;picuous appearance in their devotional practice? To &s;cruple the propriety of &s;uch an avowal, is an implicit condemnation of the principle it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Remarkably pertinent, relative to this particular, is the following language of Dr. OWEN. The Phari&s;ee a&s;cribes
<Q>all that he did to God. <HI>God, I thank thee:</HI> although he did all [he mentions,] yet he owned the
<PB N="118" REF="031844_0115_0FEF1E1B4AC2DA30">
aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, by his grace, in it all. He e&s;teemed him&s;elf much to differ from other men, but he a&s;cribed it not unto him&s;elf that &s;o he did. All the righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s which he laid claim unto, he a&s;cribed unto the benignity and goodne&s;s of God. Wherefore he neither pleaded any <HI>merit</HI> in his works, nor any works performed in his <HI>own &s;trength,</HI> without the aid of grace. All that he pretends is, that by the grace of God he had fulfilled the <HI>condition</HI> of the Cove|nant, and thereon expected to be ju&s;tified. And whatever words men &s;hall be plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of in their vocal prayers, God interprets their minds accord|ing to what they tru&s;t in, as unto their ju&s;tification before him. And if &s;ome men will be true to their <HI>own principles,</HI> this [prayer of the Phari&s;ee] is the prayer which, <HI>mutatis, mutandis,</HI> they <HI>ought</HI> to make.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Doctrine of Ju&s;tification,</HI> Chap.

<Q>To &s;ay, he who <HI>worketh not,</HI> is ju&s;tified through believing; is to &s;ay, that his works, whatever they be, have <HI>no influence</HI> into his ju&s;tification; nor hath God, in ju&s;tifying him, any re&s;pect unto them.

<PB N="127" REF="031844_0124_0FEF1E37C065C2C8">
in our ju&s;tification before God, when he him&s;elf affirms that they are of <HI>none at all?</HI> Neither are the words capable of any evading interpretation. <HI>He that worketh not,</HI> IS <HI>he that worketh not,</HI> let men &s;ay what they plea&s;e, and di&s;tingui&s;h as long as they will.

<P><Q>But the Apo&s;tle further adds, in the de&s;cription of the &s;ubject of ju&s;tification, that God <HI>ju&s;tifieth the</HI> UN|GODLY.

If any other per&s;on dare but &s;ay, that God <HI>ju&s;tifieth the</HI> UNGODLY; he is pre&s;ently reflected on as one that, by his doctrine, would overthrow the nece&s;&s;ity of godline&s;s, holine&s;s, obedience, or good works. For what need can there be of any of them, if God ju&s;tifieth the <HI>ungodly?</HI> Howbeit, this is a periphra&s;is of God, that he is he who <HI>ju&s;tifieth the</HI> UNGODLY.

But the difference is about the <HI>mean|ing</HI>

of the words. If &s;o, it may be allowed without mutual offence, though we &s;hould mi&s;take their proper &s;en&s;e.

<P>The &s;entiment is adapted to <HI>encourage boa&s;ting.</HI> This, however, is directly contrary to the apo&s;tolic doctrine.

According to the doctrine of Paul, a ju&s;tified &s;inner, with reference to the moment preceding his ju&s;tification, has no more ground to think well of his per&s;onal qualifications, or to applaud his own exertions, relative to that affair; than his unhappy neighbour has, who is dying under a cur&s;e, and &s;inking into final ruin.&mdash;But, admitting that any degree of holine&s;s be nece&s;&s;ary to warrant a &s;inner's dependence on Chri&s;t, it mu&s;t be &s;o to ju&s;tification through faith in his blood: becau&s;e it is in virtue of per&s;onal &s;anctity that he is qualified for <HI>believing;</HI> and, con&s;equently, for the <HI>imputation</HI> of our Lord's vicarious obedience to him.

<P>For, as Dr. OWEN argues,
<Q>If we are in <HI>any &s;en&s;e</HI> ju&s;tified [by our per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s] in the &s;ight of God, we have <HI>whereof to boa&s;t</HI> before him. We may not have &s;o <HI>ab&s;olutely,</HI> and with re&s;pect to <HI>merit;</HI> yet

we have &s;o comparatively, and in re&s;pect of <HI>others,</HI> who cannot make the &s;ame plea for their ju&s;tification.

But <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <GAP DESC="foreign">, the words u&s;ed by the Apo&s;tle, are of an indifferent &s;ignification; and, as they are applied, may denote a <HI>virtue,</HI> as well as a <HI>vice.</HI> So they do, Heb. iii. 6 <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See al&s;o Rom. xv. 17. 1 Cor, i. 31.

&mdash;I have enlarged the more on this particular, that the reader may perceive how nearly the principle oppo&s;ed relates to the doctrine of ju&s;tification; and how much this capital doctrine is corrupted by that principle.</P>
<P>Once more: Suppo&s;ing it nece&s;&s;ary for every &s;inner to po&s;&s;e&s;s more, or le&s;s, of true holine&s;s, before he be authori&s;ed to believe in Chri&s;t; it is hard to conceive how any one ever can believe in him. This, perhaps, may appear by the following con&s;iderations. Whoever believes in Je&s;us, relies on him as redeeming &s;inners from the cur&s;e of the law, and the damnation of hell. No one, therefore, depends upon him, till convinced of &s;in, and apprehen&s;ive of danger. Now, as nothing but &s;in expo&s;es men to pre&s;ent condemnation, and &s;inal ruin; &s;o it is that only which renders them filthy, and
<PB N="133" REF="031844_0130_0FEF1E4832C3B270">
vile, and worthle&s;s. The more any one, therefore, feels his want of deliverance from <HI>the wrath to come</HI>; the more keenly &s;en&s;ible he mu&s;t be of his complicated guilt, his great ba&s;ene&s;s, and his ab&s;olute unworthine&s;s, in the fight of God. While, con&s;equently, he is per&s;uaded, that &s;ome degree of holine&s;s is previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to warrant his reliance on Je&s;us Chri&s;t; he mu&s;t either labour to reform his life, to amend his heart, and to obtain &s;ome righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own, as the pede&s;tal on which to &s;tand when laying hold of Chri&s;t, or &s;ink in de&s;pair: and, in either ca&s;e, he is far from believing on the Son of God.&mdash;Thus, while earne&s;tly de&s;iring an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and con&s;idering him&s;elf as de&s;titute of the requi&s;ite holine&s;s, he, as the Prophet &s;peaks, <HI>labours in the very fire,</HI> and <HI>wearies him&s;elf for very vanity.</HI> Having &s;uch views of him&s;elf, and of the character under which only he is warranted to believe in Je&s;us; neither the go&s;pel, with its cheering declarations; nor the Mediator, with his immen&s;e fulne&s;s of ble&s;&s;ings and of grace, can afford him the lea&s;t relief; they being quite out of his reach. Becau&s;e, till con&s;cious of an holy di&s;po&s;ition, or a pious turn of heart, he neither does, nor can con&s;ider him&s;elf as one toward whom the go&s;pel wears a &s;miling a&s;pect; or as authori&s;ed to take the lea&s;t encouragement from it. On the hypothe&s;is oppo&s;ed, therefore, nothing but embarra&s;&s;ment, and painful di&s;appointment, are likely to attend him.&mdash;But were he, by &s;trenuous efforts, to obtain a per&s;ua&s;ion,
<PB N="134" REF="031844_0131_0FEF1E4C7745DB48">
that his inclinations have taken a virtuous turn; that his internal character is greatly improved; and, under this con&s;ideration of him&s;elf, to conclude, That <HI>now</HI> he may believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; what mu&s;t be thought of his conduct? Why, that he is ignorant of the go&s;pel; that he is <HI>of the works of the law</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 10.</NOTE>; and, that the pains he has taken have produced a good conceit of him&s;elf, rather than prepared him for faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. So inimical to &s;olid peace and real holine&s;s is the &s;entiment which I oppo&s;e, that, according to the different &s;tate of a per&s;on's con&s;cience, it has a natural tendency, either to <HI>elevate</HI> with &s;elfrighteous pride, or to <HI>depre&s;s</HI> with de&s;ponding fear.

<P>On this hypothe&s;is there is, indeed, no &s;uch thing as <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> or glad tidings, for any of tho&s;e whom the Scrip|tures denominate, <HI>&s;inners</HI>&mdash;the <HI>ungodly</HI>&mdash;the <HI>lo&s;t</HI>&mdash;tho&s;e who are in the way to final ruin.

<PB N="135" REF="031844_0132_0FEF1E4F80D082E8">
are far from pronouncing per&s;ons of that character, the <HI>ungodly,</HI> or the <HI>lo&s;t:</HI> and they are equally far from teaching, that creatures, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any degree of true &s;anctity, are in danger of eternal perdition. For it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that our divine Sovereign will ever &s;end holine&s;s to hell: or that the &s;ubjects of truly pious di&s;po&s;itions are in the road to ruin.</P>
<P>Whereas, if we con&s;ider the in&s;pired Writings as exhibiting a full, free, and everla&s;ting &s;alvation, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the chief of &s;inners; if we con&s;ider the te&s;ti|mony of God concerning his incarnate Son, as a com|plete warrant for the mo&s;t guilty and ungodly to believe in him; there is a revealed foundation of hope for the vile&s;t of men, even when they have the &s;tronge&s;t con|viction of that being their proper character. The word of grace, re&s;pecting the perfect work of Chri&s;t, being viewed in this light, is de&s;ervedly, and by way of &s;in|gular eminence, called, THE GLAD TIDINGS. For, be the wants of a &s;inner ever &s;o many, and his unworthine&s;s ever &s;o great, the all &s;ufficient Je&s;us is pre&s;ented to view, as encouraging his immediate dependence, and as rejecting none that apply to him.

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. OBJECTIONS ANSWERED.</HEAD>
<P>AGAINST the &s;entiment for which I plead, and in oppo&s;ition to the cour&s;e of my rea&s;oning, it has been &s;trenuou&s;ly urged;
<Q>Repentance includes an holy di&s;po&s;ition, and mu&s;t <HI>precede</HI> faith in Chri&s;t.</Q>
&mdash;But, &s;uppo&s;ing the priority of repentance to faith were granted, it would infer no valid objection to the principle here defended: except it were proved, that repentance mu&s;t precede, as con&s;tituting an e&s;&s;ential part of the &s;inner's <HI>warrant</HI> to believe in Je&s;us. That, however, is not likely to be &s;oon evinced.</P>
<P>In what light, then, is true repentance to be con&s;i|dered? As <HI>a change of mind, or after-thought?</HI> This, indeed, &s;eems to be the literal import of the original word <GAP DESC="foreign">: and that, we acknowledge, precedes faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For while a &s;inner is either &s;tupidly inattentive to his immortal intere&s;ts, or expecting ju&s;tification by his own obedience, he will not come to Chri&s;t.&mdash;As <HI>a conviction of &s;in,</HI> attended with apprehen|&s;ions of eternal ruin? This al&s;o, it is readily granted, precedes faith in Chri&s;t. For, whoever believes in Je&s;us,
<PB N="138" REF="031844_0135_0FEF1E5B5F697930">
regards him as the only Saviour from divine wrath: re&s;pecting the danger of which, a conviction of &s;in mu&s;t precede. Nay, we are led, by the language of Scripture, to con&s;ider believing in Chri&s;t, as no other than <HI>fleeing to the hope &s;et before us,</HI> that we may e&s;cape <HI>the wrath to come</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 18. Matt. iii. 7.</NOTE>. That conviction of &s;in and &s;en&s;e of danger, &s;hould not be con&s;idered, however, as inducing God to <HI>give,</HI> but as inclining us to <HI>receive:</HI> not as exciting the Father of mercies to forgive our offences, or the com|pa&s;&s;ionate Je&s;us to ju&s;tify our per&s;ons; but as impelling us to accept the provi&s;ion which &s;overeign grace has made for the entirely de&s;titute. Be&s;ides, neither that <HI>change of mind,</HI> nor this <HI>apprehen&s;ion of danger,</HI> can be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as an holy di&s;po&s;ition: becau&s;e they re&s;pect the &s;tate of the intellect, and of the con&s;cience; not that of the <HI>heart.</HI> Or, if the heart be affected, it is no otherwi&s;e than as a new turn is given to the operation of &s;elf-love: which, &s;imply and ab&s;olutely con&s;idered, has no holine&s;s in it.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t repentance, then, be viewed under the notion of <HI>&s;orrow for &s;in,</HI> and <HI>aver&s;ion to it,</HI> con&s;idered as an oppo&s;ition to divine authority, and as a contrariety to divine purity? This, indeed, is that repentance which is connected with pardon and &s;alvation. But then it may be ju&s;tly queried, whether it was ever found in any
<PB N="139" REF="031844_0136_0FEF1E5CED0E6C80">
&s;inner before he believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t: as the follow|ing con&s;iderations, perhaps, may &s;how.</P>
<P>Repentance, under this notion of it, is manife&s;tly a fruit of &s;incere e&s;teem for the dominion of God, and of love to his infinite excellence. Becau&s;e no one can be cordially grieved for oppo&s;ing a government, which he does not e&s;teem; nor for his pa&s;t aver&s;ion to excellence, which he does not admire. But the Scrip|tures will not permit our concluding, that the&s;e pious affections are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;inners, before they receive the truth, and believe in Chri&s;t. If we really love and revere God, it is <HI>becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>there is forgivene&s;s with him;</HI> becau&s;e that love, as expre&s;&s;ed in the gift of his own Son, and that forgivene&s;s, through the atonement, have been more or le&s;s revealed to us, in the glad tidings of reconciliation.&mdash;All men, when their con&s;ciences are alarmed, being pained with appre|hen&s;ions of eternal de&s;truction, will &s;orrow for the <HI>con&s;e|quences</HI> of &s;in; but none be&s;ides believers in Je&s;us mourn over and abhor its <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> evil.</P>
<P>Genuine &s;orrow for &s;in, and &s;elf aba&s;ement before God, are clo&s;ely connected, in ancient prophecy, with faith in the bleeding Immanuel, and with reconciliation to our offended Sovereign; rather, they are con&s;idered as <HI>effects</HI> of that faith and reconciliation. For thus it is written; <HI>I will e&s;tabli&s;h my covenant with thee; and thou

<P>Here we have genuine &s;orrow for &s;in, con&s;idered as rebellion again&s;t Jehovah's government, and as abhor|rent from his purity.

<P>That the manife&s;tation of divine benignity toward our apo&s;tate &s;pecies, is friendly to holy &s;orrow; and that the exerci&s;e of human compa&s;&s;ion towards di&s;affected neighbours, has a natural tendency to produce reforma|tion, we are taught by the following remarkable words. <HI>The goodne&s;s of God leadeth thee to repentance&mdash;If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thir&s;t, give him drink: for in &s;o doing thou &s;halt heap coals of fire on his head</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 4. xii. 20.</NOTE>. Are the exerci&s;e of divine kindne&s;s, in the cour&s;e of common Providence, and the puny efforts of human compa&s;&s;ion, for the relief of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fellow-creatures, adapted to produce repentance and reformation in their different objects? then, &s;urely, we may conclude, that the bound|le&s;s benignity of God, revealed in the go&s;pel of our &s;al|vation, mu&s;t be incomparably better fitted, to excite an

abhorrence of &s;in, conciliate the affections to God, and produce a &s;eries of holy obedience.</P>
<P>Further: True repentance is the <HI>gift</HI> of Chri&s;t, con|&s;idered as the a&s;cended Sovereign and Saviour of his church. As it is written, <HI>Him hath God exalted, with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to I&s;rael, and forgivene&s;s of &s;ins</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts v. 31.</NOTE>. Repen|tance and pardon, being here &s;o intimately connected, and both of them repre&s;ented as the gifts of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; we are led to conclude, that real repentance for &s;in, and faith in the blood of Chri&s;t, coexi&s;t; that godly &s;orrow &s;uppo&s;es and includes faith in revealed mercy; and that both of them are the fruits of &s;overeign grace.</P>
<P>Dr. OWEN, when &s;peaking of <HI>humiliation for &s;in,</HI> expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf as follows.
<Q>There is a re&s;pect in it to the <HI>love of God:</HI> and this breaks the heart of the poor returning &s;inner.

<P>Thus Mr. JAMES HERVEY:

The word, you know, is <GAP DESC="foreign">: which, in its primary &s;ignification, denotes not &s;o much a reformation of conduct, as a change of &s;entiment.&mdash;Suppo&s;e it to &s;ignify a reformation of
<PB N="144" REF="031844_0141_0FEF1E702EAD9D90">
conduct; the meaning then may be as follows. <HI>Repent;</HI> for&s;ake all your vices, and all your follies; mortify every evil temper, and renounce every evil way. In order to render this practicable, <HI>believe the go&s;pel;</HI> wherein a Saviour is preached and di&s;played. Who makes peace for &s;uch offenders; reconciles them to God; and obtains eternal redemption for them. This will &s;weetly withdraw your affections from iniquity, and &s;weetly attach them to the ble&s;&s;ed God. Whereas, without this powerful expedient, you will never be delivered from the plea&s;ing witchcraft of your lu&s;ts. Sin will always have the dominion over you, &s;o long as you are <HI>under the law,</HI> and not <HI>under grace.</HI> Repentance, thus under&s;tood, is not the <HI>condition</HI> of obtaining &s;alvation, but the fruit of <HI>&s;alvation it&s;elf&mdash;I came, not to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance.</HI> Many per&s;ons, I am apt to &s;u&s;pect, mi&s;take the meaning of this &s;weet pa&s;&s;age; and turn the <HI>freely flowing</HI> benefits of the go&s;pel, into the <HI>rigorous</HI> requirements of the law.

Whereas, it is like Jo&s;eph, the governor of Egypt, calling his brethren, each to receive a &s;uit of apparel, and all to partake of his ho&s;pitable banquet. Chri&s;t, as a Saviour, is the greate&s;t of benefactors. When, therefore, he calls to repentance, his intention is, not to demand, but to be&s;tow; not to enjoin, but

<P>The &s;ame excellent Author, when &s;peaking of <HI>&s;anc|tification</HI> by the truth, &s;ays:
<Q>There is a great an&s;wera|blene&s;s and corre&s;pondency, between the <HI>heart</HI> of a believer, and the <HI>truth</HI> that he doth believe. As the word, is in the go&s;pel, &s;o is grace in the heart: yea, they are the <HI>&s;ame thing</HI> variou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed.

The meaning is, that the doctrine of the go&s;pel begets the <HI>form, figure, image,</HI> or <HI>likene&s;s</HI> of it&s;elf, in the hearts of them that believe. So they are ca&s;t into the <HI>mould</HI> of it. As is the one, &s;o is the other. The principle of <HI>grace</HI> in the heart, and that in the <HI>word,</HI> are as children of

the &s;ame parent, completely re&s;embling and repre&s;ent|ing one another. Grace is a <HI>living word,</HI> and the word is <HI>figured, limned grace.</HI> As is regeneration, &s;o is a regenerate heart: as is the doctrine of faith, &s;o is a believer. And this gives great evidence unto, and a&s;&s;urance of the things believed&mdash;Fir&s;t, the <HI>truth is in Je&s;us:</HI> then it is expre&s;&s;ed in the word. This word, learned and believed, becomes grace in the heart, every way an&s;wering unto the Lord Chri&s;t his <HI>image,</HI> from whom this <HI>tran&s;forming truth</HI> did thus proceed.

Nor, upon this propo&s;ition, is it the duty of men to que&s;tion whether they have faith, or no, but actually to believe; and faith, in its operation, will evidence it&s;elf.

<P>Again, he &s;ays:
<Q>The whole matter of &s;anctification and holine&s;s is peculiarly joined with, and limited unto, the <HI>doctrine, truth,</HI> and <HI>grace</HI> of the go&s;pel: for holine&s;s is nothing, but the implanting, writing, and reali&s;ing of the go&s;pel in our &s;ouls.

<P>Re&s;pecting the word of truth as the in&s;trument of regeneration, it has, to the following purpo&s;e, been objected:
<Q>They who con&s;ider divine truth as the mean of regeneration mu&s;t grant, that it is by the Holy Spirit the word is introduced into the mind, in order to its having &s;uch an effect&mdash;That &s;ome operation of

the Spirit on the under&s;tanding takes place, in order &s;o to <HI>change</HI> it, as to receive the word&mdash;And, that this operation <HI>precedes</HI> the entrance of light into the mind.

<P>According to this view of the &s;ubject, the word of truth, having no influence, is of <HI>no u&s;e,</HI> in the work of regeneration; the &s;alutary and important change being produced entirely without it. Either, therefore, by tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>born again,</HI> the objector mu&s;t intend &s;omething very different from what is meant by them in Scripture; or he is not far from contradicting the expre&s;s determination of in&s;pired Writers: as appears by various pa&s;&s;ages already adduced&mdash;To imagine that a preparation of the <HI>mind,</HI> merely to receive the truth, is a change &s;o great as to an&s;wer tho&s;e emphatical expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>regeneration, born again, born of the Spirit, born of God,</HI> and <HI>a new heart;</HI> is, I think, very unwar|rantable.

him as <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> except his heart be renewed, &s;o as to love God and approve of his ways. Nay, the Author him&s;elf confirms my a&s;&s;ertion, by el&s;ewhere &s;aying;
<Q>This regeneration of which I am &s;peaking con&s;i&s;ts in a change of the <HI>will,</HI> or <HI>heart</HI>&mdash;I have good grounds to a&s;&s;ert, that in regeneration the <HI>will,</HI> or <HI>heart</HI> is the <HI>immediate &s;ubject</HI> of the divine operation, and &s;o of the moral change that is effected thereby <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 57, 58.</NOTE>.</Q>

<P>It is too ha&s;tily a&s;&s;umed, that the mind is <HI>prepared</HI> to receive the light of &s;piritual knowledge, previous to the truth having any influence upon it.

If the father of lies, by words of deceit, without any previous phy&s;ical influence on the mental powers, polluted the imagination, ob&s;cured the under|&s;tanding, and corrupted the heart of Eve, when in her primitive &s;tate, and under a &s;trong bias to obedience; which, I pre&s;ume, this Writer will acknowledge: why &s;hould he deny, that the Holy Spirit, by the word of truth, without any preparatory agency on the &s;oul, enlightens the mind, impre&s;&s;es the con&s;cience, and gives a new turn to the heart, of one that is dead in &s;in?</P>

Con&s;equently, as the fir&s;t inclination to evil, in the human heart, when perfectly pure, was produced, with|out any previous phy&s;ical influence, by the lie of Satan; we are led, by analogy, equally as by the language of Scripture, to con&s;ider the fir&s;t holy tendency, in a heart that is totally corrupt, as produced by the truth of God, without any preparatory agency.</P>
<P>This argument from analogy is the more ob&s;ervable, as it ari&s;es from the only fact of the kind, that ever did, or ever will take place among men.

<P><PB N="192" REF="031844_0189_0FEF1F014E503710">It has been objected,
<Q>To a&s;&s;ert that &s;inners, while de&s;titute of holine&s;s, are warranted to believe in Chri&s;t; is to maintain, that they are authori&s;ed to expect the felicity of heaven, while their native love of &s;in conti|nues in all its force, and while they are hardened rebels again&s;t God.</Q>
But there is a great and palpable difference between per&s;ons, while in their native &s;tate, being authori&s;ed to <HI>believe</HI> in Je&s;us; and their being warranted, while in that condition, to <HI>expect</HI> final hap|pine&s;s. Yet this objection proceeds on a &s;uppo&s;ition, that whoever is encouraged by the word of grace to de|pend on Chri&s;t; is, at the very &s;ame in&s;tant, merely on the &s;ame ground, and while an unbeliever, equally au|thori&s;ed to expect everla&s;ting life: which is a gro&s;s mi&s;|take. For he that believes in Chri&s;t, relies on him as <HI>ju&s;tifying the ungodly:</HI> but he who, on &s;criptural grounds, hopes for future felicity, expects it as a believer; as in a ju&s;tified &s;tate; as having a turn of heart, in &s;ome de|gree &s;uited to the employments and enjoyments of hea|ven.

heavenly things. The <HI>&s;inner</HI> believes: the <HI>believer</HI> hopes.&mdash;Nor can any man believe in Chri&s;t, and <HI>continue</HI> a rebel again&s;t God: for &s;overeign mercy, when it relieves the con&s;cience, alters the bias of the heart, and forms the character anew. God, in the exerci&s;e and manife&s;tation of pardoning grace to rebels, makes them his friends.

<P><Q>If we maintain that the ungodly are warranted to believe in Je&s;us, there will be great danger of encou|raging a &s;uperficial, Antinomian faith. Becau&s;e guilty creatures, under the power of their depravity, are much more likely to approve the character of Chri&s;t, when repre&s;ented as willing to receive the altogether unholy; than if he were con&s;idered as receiving none but tho&s;e who are cordially di&s;po&s;ed to perform the divine precepts.</Q></P>
<P>That the &s;entiment for which I plead, may be pro&s;ti|tuted to licentious purpo&s;es; and that, in certain in&s;tances, it probably has been &s;o abu&s;ed, will be admitted. But, be that as it may, Je&s;us mu&s;t either be &s;o exhibited in a public mini&s;try, as to &s;uit the character, the &s;tate, the circum&s;tances of apo&s;tate creatures, or there is no <HI>go&s;pel</HI> for them. Be&s;ides, the mi&s;application of any doctrine, affords no argument again&s;t, either its truth, or its impor|tance:
<PB N="194" REF="031844_0191_0FEF1F0B8A8C9F60">
becau&s;e the mo&s;t excellent doctrines, and the plaine&s;t pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, have been frequently abu&s;ed to execrable purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>This objection &s;eems to imply, that a &s;elfrighteous turn of heart, and phari&s;aical pride, make no part of human depravity. For it apparently &s;uppo&s;es, that there is little or no danger of &s;inners treating Chri&s;t with di&s;re&s;pect, except by con&s;idering him as <HI>the mini&s;ter of &s;in:</HI> or, of their oppo&s;ing the de&s;igns of divine grace, in any way, be&s;ides that of licentiou&s;ne&s;s. But it appears, from Scripture, from experience, and from ob&s;ervation, that &s;inners are naturally and &s;trongly inclined to &s;eek ju&s;tification <HI>by the works of the law;</HI> that a violent pro|pen&s;ity to cheri&s;h the notion of &s;elf-worthine&s;s, is an e&s;&s;ential part of their natural depravity; and that the di&s;re&s;pect with which Chri&s;t is generally treated by them, ari&s;es principally from that quarter. Yes, their low thoughts re&s;pecting the evil of &s;in, and the high opinion they form of their own character, are the chief &s;ource of that neglect with which they treat the divine Je&s;us, and of all their oppo&s;ition to &s;aving grace. Nay, &s;o univer&s;al, and &s;o predominant is this propen&s;ity to &s;elf-worthine&s;s, that, for <HI>one</HI> who abu&s;es the &s;entiment here defended, by converting it into an occa&s;ion of &s;in; <HI>ten thou&s;and</HI> may be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as di&s;honouring Chri&s;t, and as rebelling again&s;t God, under the pernicious influence of that principle which I oppo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="031844_0192_0FEF1F0D1AF27FA0">It is a great mi&s;take to imagine, that ungodly men are &s;o ready to adopt the &s;entiment for which I contend. Certain it is, from the hi&s;tory of our Lord's mini&s;try, and from the writings of Paul, that few things in the preaching, either of Chri&s;t, or of the Apo&s;tle, were &s;o offen&s;ive to per&s;ons of re&s;pectability among the Jews, as the doctrine which they preached, relative to pardon and acceptance with God. The di&s;cour&s;es of Je&s;us, re&s;pecting divine grace, were extremely offen&s;ive to the Scribes, the Phari&s;ees, and the reputedly devout in general. But, had the tenour of our Saviour's preach|ing, or of his conver&s;e among the people, been contrary to the principle here avowed; it is not &s;uppo&s;able that the Jews would have &s;o frequently complained of him, and objected again&s;t his conduct, as they did.

them&s;elves, and were con&s;idered by others, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing virtuous di&s;po&s;itions and holy zeal: yet they were tho&s;e to whom our Lord addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the following manner; <HI>Verily I &s;ay unto you, That the publicans and the harlots,</HI> the mo&s;t profligate of both &s;exes, <HI>go into the kingdom of heaven before you.

<P>Such was the treatment of Je&s;us, by the mo&s;t re&s;pec|table part of the public; and &s;uch was his language concerning tho&s;e who, under the fair pretext of zeal for holine&s;s, rejected his doctrine, and per&s;ecuted his per|&s;on!

<P>That the mini&s;try of Paul was perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;entiment here defended, appears from tho&s;e objections with which he meets, kand from the an&s;wers which he returns. Thus, for example: <HI>Some affirm that we &s;ay, Let us do evil, that good may come&mdash;Do we then make void the law through faith?&mdash;Shall we continue in &s;in, that grace may abound?&mdash;Shall we &s;in, becau&s;e we are not under the law, but under grace</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 7, 8, 31. vi. 1, 15.</NOTE>?&mdash;Such were the objections: and they imply, That, in the e&s;timation of tho&s;e who made them, the doctrine of Paul, implicitly, or by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, <HI>vacated the authority of God</HI> in his law&mdash;That believers, being delivered from the kw, as a covenant, or as pre&s;cribing the condition on which everla&s;ting life is to be obtained, may &s;afely <HI>continue in &s;in</HI>&mdash;That &s;uch continuance in the practice of &s;in, would <HI>illu&s;trate the riches,</HI> and <HI>manife&s;t the glory,</HI> of divine grace&mdash;And that, by accumulating moral evil, <HI>the highe&s;t good would be promoted.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;uch various and formidable objections was the doctrine of Paul con&s;idered, by multitudes, as ju&s;tly

not! or, if a fact, the objector's conduct mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered as the effu&s;ion of mental imbecility, as a violent paroxy&s;m of prejudice, or as the virulence of deliberate malice.</P>
<P>But if, on the contrary, we under&s;tand Paul as maintaining, That Chri&s;t, with all his fulne&s;s of &s;pi|ritual ble&s;&s;ings, is <HI>free, perfectly</HI> free for the vile&s;t; if we con&s;ider him as encouraging the <HI>chief</HI> of &s;inners, merely under the character of peri&s;hing wretches, to rely on Je&s;us for their immediate acceptance with God, and as giving them a&s;&s;urance that, in &s;o doing, they &s;hall not be di&s;appointed; if we further con&s;ider the Apo&s;tle as teaching, that the ju&s;tification of &s;inners is merely, en|tirely, ab&s;olutely on the ground of our Lord's vicarious obedience imputed; <HI>then</HI> we perceive the true &s;ource of the&s;e objections.

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. THE SALUTARY AND PRACTICAL TENDENCIES OF THE PRINCIPLE MAINTAINED.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE truth, as it is in Je&s;us,</HI> being the doctrine <HI>according to godline&s;s</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 21. 1 Tim. vi. 3. Titus i. 1.</NOTE>, cannot but be adapted to practi|cal purpo&s;es; and, therefore, mu&s;t have a &s;alutary influence on the hearts of all tho&s;e who really believe it. Of this nature is the &s;entiment for which I plead; as, perhaps, may appear by the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P><HI>It has a natural tendency to humble &s;elf-righteous pride, by annihilating all di&s;tinctions among men, re&s;pecting the ground of their acceptance with God.</HI> Now this is per|fectly agreeable to the genius of evangelical truth, and to the nature of Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom; as appears by the following prophetic Oracle, relative to the mini&s;try of John the Bapti&s;t, and the commencement of go&s;pel times. <HI>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make &s;traight in the de&s;ert a highway for our God. Every valley &s;hall be exalted, and every mountaim and hill &s;hall be made low: and the crooked &s;hall be made &s;traight, and the rough places plain: and the glory of the Lord &s;hall be revealed, and all

<P>As <HI>vain man would be wi&s;e, though born like a wild a&s;&s;es's colt</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job xi. 12.</NOTE>; &s;o proud man would be righteous, though guilty before God, and obnoxious to ruin. If, however, the divine law be equitable, &s;inners are ju&s;tly accur&s;ed<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 10.</NOTE>; and, if their condemnation be righteous, they cannot have the lea&s;t hope, except through &s;overeign mercy.&mdash; A &s;mall degree of difference from others, with regard to exterior character, is commonly con&s;idered, notwith|&s;tanding, as recommending to the favour of God, and as furni&s;hing a ground of hope, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Now, in whom&s;oever this per&s;ua&s;ion prevails, the go&s;pel is under&s;tood as directing all the relief it reveals, to the qualified, the virtuous, the worthy: not the guilty, the vile, and the wretched. It is con&s;idered, therefore, not as adapted to humble the proud heart, and to relieve the pained con&s;cience; but as maintaining a proper di&s;|tinction between different characters, and as paying a ju&s;t regard to human worth. While, con&s;equently, to multitudes, who think them&s;elves comparatively righte|ous, it mini&s;ters food for &s;elf importance; it leaves others, who con&s;ider them&s;elves as the chief of &s;inners, without the lea&s;t foundation of hope.&mdash;The principle,
<PB N="205" REF="031844_0202_0FEF1F2EF4CD2A88">
however, for which I contend, has a directly contrary tendency: for, in prophetic language, it <HI>levels</HI> moun|tains, and <HI>elevates</HI> valleys. Or, in the words of our Lord, it <HI>aba&s;es</HI> tho&s;e that are exalted, and <HI>exalts</HI> tho&s;e that are aba&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiii. 12. Luke xiv. 11. xviii. 14.</NOTE>. Becau&s;e it maintains, that there is the very <HI>&s;ame</HI> ground of encouragement, and to an <HI>equal</HI> degree, for men to belive in Je&s;us, whether they be e&s;teemed moral, or profligate; pious, or profane.</P>
<P><HI>It is mo&s;t happily &s;uited to relieve tho&s;e who are held in the &s;nare of de&s;pondency, by forbidding de&s;pair in the vile&s;t wretch that lives.</HI> Many there are, we have rea&s;on to think, who, having, for a long cour&s;e of time, violated the dictates of con&s;cience, by indulging their wor&s;t pro|pen&s;ities; having, in multiplied in&s;tances, acted contrary to friendly advice, to their own re&s;olutions, promi&s;es, vows; and having, perhaps, been the manife&s;t occa&s;ion of ruin to various others; implicitly &s;ay, with tho&s;e in the Prophet, <HI>There is no hope: no; for we have loved &s;trangers, and after them will we go</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. ii. 25.</NOTE>. Thus, in a kind of &s;ullen de&s;pair, they harden their con&s;ciences; in order to enjoy, for a while, the plea&s;ures of &s;in, without con|troul, and without remor&s;e. Perceiving no rea&s;on for hope, they endeavour to di&s;card fear. Having no con|ception that <HI>there is forgivene&s;s with God,</HI> for per&s;ons in

their &s;ituation; or that &s;uch enormous offenders may find acceptance through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; they ru&s;h on to final ruin. For, where there is no hope of e&s;caping evil, there are no efforts to guard again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The doctrine for which I plead, is, however, adapted to break the de&s;tructive &s;nare, by exhibiting a ground of hope. Yes, the gracious go&s;pel, con&s;idered as a com|plete warrant for the ungodly to believe in Je&s;us, encou|rages the mo&s;t profligate, and the mo&s;t criminal, to regard the atonement of Chri&s;t as all&s;ufficient.
<Q>There is not,</Q>
as one ob&s;erves,
<Q>a more effectual remedy [again&s;t de&s;pondency,] than the con&s;ideration of the <HI>freene&s;s</HI> of the grace of God in Chri&s;t and the promi&s;es: which are not made to &s;uch as <HI>de&s;erve</HI> mercy, but to &s;uch as <HI>want</HI> it; not to righteous per&s;ons, but to &s;in|ners; not to the whole, but to the &s;ick&mdash;Of all the ways and experiments to bear up a &s;inking &s;pirit, there is no con&s;ideration like this, That from the beginning to the end of our &s;alvation, nothing is prima|rily active but <HI>free grace.</HI> This is a firm bottom of comfort again&s;t the guilt of the mo&s;t bloody and crim|&s;on &s;ins: becau&s;e free grace is not tied to any rules: it may do what it plea&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. SPURSTOWE'S <HI>Wells of Salvation opened,</HI> p. 50, 51.</NOTE>.</Q>
It belongs, indeed, to the very nature of <HI>grace,</HI> properly &s;o called, to be ab&s;o|lutely free and &s;overeign, in all its be&s;towments: for
<PB N="207" REF="031844_0204_0FEF1F3368D51830">
where there is de&s;ert, whether intrin&s;ic or pactional, the operation of grace nece&s;&s;arily cea&s;es, and, if recti|tude prevail, that of equity takes place.</P>
<P><HI>It is admirably fitted to excite hope and produce comfort in tho&s;e who, though not &s;unk in de&s;pondency, are deeply di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by a &s;en&s;e of guilt, of depravity, and of unwor|thine&s;s.</HI> Are the con&s;ciences of men alarmed, by a conviction of &s;in, and an apprehen&s;ion of de&s;erved wrath for pa&s;t offences?

Di&s;cerning nothing in their hearts, nor any thing in their lives, which de&s;erves the name of <HI>holine&s;s;</HI> but, on the contrary, much that &s;eems to mark them out for de&s;truction; they have nothing to remove their painful fears, or to relieve their burdened con&s;ciences, except what the go&s;pel &s;ays concerning divine mercy, as manife&s;ted in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He being revealed, however, as perfectly &s;uitable to their wants, and as completely free for their acceptance; they are pre&s;ented, by &s;overeign grace, with an all&s;ufficient Saviour for their immediate dependence. Con&s;iding in the te&s;ti|mony of God as true, and receiving the provi&s;ion of his grace as a free gift; they find relief, and enjoy peace Nor does the comfort obtained ari&s;e from reflecting on the <HI>manner</HI> in which they believe, but from that <HI>grace</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="031844_0205_0FEF1F37D99C1F30">
which the go&s;pel reveals, and from the <HI>all&s;ufficiency</HI> of Je&s;us in whom they tru&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>It is of great importance to the real Chri&s;tian, in times of &s;piritual darkne&s;s and of di&s;couragement.</HI> Has he, by the power of indwelling &s;in, or through the force of Satan's temptations, lo&s;t that peace which ari&s;es from a view of intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Is he incapable of approaching God with a filial confidence, crying, <HI>Abba Father?</HI> he recurs to this truth, as the fir&s;t &s;pring of his encouragement, and, under the character of a <HI>&s;inner,</HI> applies to Chri&s;t afre&s;h. It being fixed in his mind, as a leading principle of revealed truth, that the mo&s;t ungodly are authori&s;ed to believe in Je&s;us; and that no degree of previous holine&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e; he cannot, even in his wor&s;t condition, but con&s;ider him&s;elf as within the verge of that encouragement. As, therefore, it is by faith in Chri&s;t that he derives hope; and as, under the influence of hope, &s;piritual endeavours are excited; &s;o, in this procedure, not only peace of con&s;cience, but prayer and watchfulne&s;s, brotherly love and &s;elf-denial, communion with God and heavenly mindedne&s;s, are promoted.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, under the practical influence of this principle, he will not be &s;o liable to deceive him&s;elf, with regard to his real &s;tate in the &s;ight of God; by inferring his regeneration from any religious impul&s;es which he has felt,

For though it mu&s;t be admitted, that every real Chri&s;tian is <HI>led by the Spirit of God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 14.</NOTE>; and though, by the word of truth, that divine Agent produce, excite, and maintain devout affections in the &s;oul; yet we ought never to con&s;ider &s;ub&s;tantial evidence of true godline&s;s, as ari&s;ing from &s;ecret impul&s;es, however &s;trong; nor from tran&s;ient fla&s;hes of religious affection, be they ever &s;o high: but from the <HI>general frame</HI> of the heart, re&s;pecting the glorious God, as revealing him&s;elf in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>It is of great moment in the Chri&s;tian's daily walk with God.</HI> The rea&s;on is, it has a powerful tendency to promote an habitual regard to the word of grace and the atonement of Chri&s;t, as the only &s;ource of &s;piritual peace.

<Q>This is the <HI>only</HI> way and means to enable you to obedience, and to render what you do therein acceptable unto God. It may be, that &s;ome of you are under the power of convictions, and have
<PB N="213" REF="031844_0210_0FEF1F46872CCAC0">
made engagements unto God to live unto him, to keep your&s;elves from &s;in, and to follow after holine&s;s. It may be, you have done &s;o in afflictions, dangers, &s;ickne&s;&s;es, or upon the receipt of mercies: but yet you find that you cannot come unto any &s;tability, or con&s;i&s;|tency, in your cour&s;e. You break with God and your own &s;ouls, which fills you with new di&s;quietments; or el&s;e hardens you, and makes you &s;ecure and negli|gent: &s;o that you return unto your purpo&s;es no oftener, than your convictions, or afflictions, befal you anew. This condition is ruinous and pernicious, which nothing can deliver you from, but this clo&s;ing with forgivene&s;s. For, all that you do without this, however it may plea&s;e your minds, or ea&s;e your con&s;ciences, is not at all accepted with God. Unle&s;s this foundation be laid, all that you do is lo&s;t. All your prayers, all your duties, all your amendments, are an abomination to the Lord. Until peace is made with him, they are but the acts of enemies, which he de&s;pi&s;eth and abhor|reth. You run, it may be, earne&s;tly; but you run out of the way: you &s;trive, but not lawfully, and &s;hall never receive the crown. True go&s;pel obedience is the fruit of the faith of forgivene&s;s. Whatever you do without it, is but a building without a foundation; a ca&s;tle in the air. You may &s;ee the order of go&s;pel obedience, Eph. ii. 7&mdash;10. The foundation mu&s;t be laid in <HI>grace; riches of grace,</HI> by Chri&s;t, in the free pardon and forgivene&s;s of &s;in. From hence mu&s;t the
<PB N="214" REF="031844_0211_0FEF1F4AF3438CE8">
works of obedience proceed, if you would have them to be of God's appointment, or find acceptance with him. Without this, God will &s;ay of all your &s;ervices, wor&s;hip, obedience, as he did to the I&s;raelites of old, (Amos v. 21&mdash;25.) <HI>I de&s;pi&s;e all; reject it all:</HI> it is not to him, nor to his glory, Now, if you are under convictions of any &s;ort, there is nothing you more value, nothing you more place your confidence in, than your duties: your repentance, your amendment: what you do, and what in good time you will be. Is it nothing unto you, to lo&s;e all your hopes and all your expectations, which you have from hence? To have no other reception with God, than if all this time you had been wallowing in your &s;ins and lu&s;ts? Yet thus it is with you, if you have not begun with God on his own terms; if you have not <HI>received the atonement,</HI> in the blood of his Son; if you are not made partakers of forgivene&s;s; if your per&s;ons are not pardoned, all your duties are accur&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This alone will give you &s;uch motives and encou|ragements unto obedience, as will give you life, alacrity, and delight in it.

<Q>Our <HI>foundation</HI> in dealing with God, is Chri&s;t alone; <HI>mere</HI> grace, and pardon in him. Our <HI>building</HI> is in and by holine&s;s and obedience; as the fruits of that faith by which we have received the atonement. And great mi&s;takes there are in this matter, which bring great intanglements on the &s;ouls of men. Some are all their days laying the foundation, and are never able to build upon it, unto any comfort to them&s;elves, or u&s;efulne&s;s to others: and the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e they will be mixing with the foundation &s;tones, that are &s;it only for the following building. They will be bring|ing their obedience, duties, mortification of &s;in, and the like, unto the foundation. The&s;e are precious &s;tones to <HI>build</HI> with, but unmeet to be fir&s;t laid to bear upon them the <HI>whole weight</HI> of the building. The foundation is to be laid, as was &s;aid, in <HI>mere grace,</HI>

mercy, pardon in the blood of Chri&s;t. This the &s;oul is to accept of, and to re&s;t in, <HI>merely as it is</HI> GRACE; without the con&s;ideration of any thing in it&s;elf, but that it is &s;inful and obnoxious unto ruin. This it finds a difficulty in, and would gladly have &s;omething of its own to mix with it. It cannot tell how to fix the&s;e foundation &s;tones, without &s;ome cement of its own endeavours and duty: and becau&s;e the&s;e things will not mix, they &s;pend a fruitle&s;s labour about it all their days. But, if the foundation be <HI>of grace,</HI> it is not at all <HI>of works:</HI> for, otherwi&s;e, <HI>grace is no more grace.</HI> If any thing of our own be mixed with grace in this matter, it utterly de&s;troys the nature of <HI>grace;</HI> which, if it be not <HI>alone,</HI> it is <HI>not at all.</HI> But doth not this tend to licentiou&s;ne&s;s? Doth not this render obedience, holine&s;s, duties, mortification of &s;in, and good works, needle&s;s? God forbid! yea, this is the only way to order them aright unto the glory of God.
