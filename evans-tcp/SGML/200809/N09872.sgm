<HEAD>THE TESTIMONY OF THE Monthly Meeting of FRIENDS in PHILADELPHIA, CONCERNING OUR DEARLY BELOVED FRIEND, <HI>DANIEL STANTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN John the Divine was in exile in the i&s;le of Patmos, "He heard a voice from Heaven, &s;ay|ing, Write,&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed are the dead, who die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea &s;aith the &s;pirit, that they may re&s;t from their la|bours, and their works do follow them;" &mdash;which we believe now is the portion of our worthy friend, concerning who&s;e faithful &s;ervices we are engaged from the united motives of love and duty, to give this te&s;timony; de&s;iring, that all who read it, and more e&s;pecially the Youth, may be excited, by his example, to &s;eek an
<PB N="iv" REF="012565_0003_0F8B15C226ACE8D0">
early acquaintance with the Lord, and to take up their daily cro&s;s in the prime of their days.&mdash;Thus, they al&s;o, may become &s;hining lights and in&s;truments of good to others.</P>
<P>HE was born in this city, in the year 1708, and his father dying before his birth, and his mother a few years after, he &s;uffered great trials and hard&s;hips when very young:&mdash;Being early con|cerned to &s;eek the knowledge of God, he had a fervent de&s;ire to attend religious meetings, though &s;ubjected to many dif|ficulties and di&s;couragements, before that privilege was allowed him; yet, being earne&s;t in his de&s;ires to obtain divine fa|vour, he was eminently &s;upported under great conflicts and probations, and, con|tinuing faithful to the degrees of light and grace communicated, a di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel mini&s;try was committed to him, &s;ometime before the term of his ap|prentice&s;hip was expired; and abiding under the &s;anctifying power of truth, he grew in his gift, and became a zealous faithful mini&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="012565_0004_0F8B15C5A912E480">HE was very exemplary in his indu&s;|try and diligence, in labouring faithful|ly at his trade, to provide for his own &s;upport, and after he married, and had children, for their maintenance; and was often concerned to advi&s;e others to the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ary care; yet he continued fervent in &s;pirit for the promotion of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o that he was &s;oon engaged to leave home, and the neare&s;t connections of nature, to publi&s;h the glad tidings of the go&s;pel,&mdash;and fre|quently vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meetings of Friends in this and the adjacent provinces, and &s;everal times as far as the ea&s;tern parts of New-England. Having thus ho|ne&s;tly di&s;charged his duty among us above twenty years, and feeling his mind con&s;trained in the love of the go&s;pel, to vi&s;it the few Friends who remained in &s;ome of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, and from thence the meetings of Friends in general through Great-Britain and Ireland, he communicated his concern to a few of his mo&s;t intimate friends, who having unity therewith, he was encouraged to lay it before our monthly meeting.&mdash;Before he entered on this weighty &s;ervice, he pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="vi" REF="012565_0005_0F8B15C652E762D0">
through a near trial and affliction in the death of his beloved wife; under which exerci&s;e he was graciou&s;ly &s;upported by the arm of divine &s;trength, which had often been revealed for his help, in times of inward conflicts and outward di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>HIS concern to travel in the &s;ervice of truth continuing, and the meeting having full unity with him therein, he embarked in the fifth month, 1748, accompanied by our dear friend, Samuel Nottingham, in a ve&s;&s;el bound for Barbadoes, and having vi&s;ited the few meetings in that i&s;land, they went by way of Antigua to Tortola, where they continued &s;ome time, having &s;ome difficulty to get a pa&s;&s;age to Eu|rope; and their voyage thither was at|tended with &s;ome &s;ingular hazards and dangers, which occa&s;ioned their landing in Ireland; where our friend Daniel con|tinued &s;ome months, vi&s;iting the meet|ings of Friends in that kingdom;&mdash;and after he apprehended him&s;elf clear, went over to England, and vi&s;ited the meet|ings generally in that nation, and in Wales and Scotland, where his meek circum&s;pect conduct and conver&s;ation,
<PB N="vii" REF="012565_0006_0F8B15C6AFBE6980">
and lively edifying mini&s;try, rendred his vi&s;it very acceptable and his memory precious.</P>
<P>IN his return home, and for &s;ome time after, he was in a low afflicted &s;tate of mind; being apprehen&s;ive, that through diffidence, and the want of perfect re&s;ig|nation to the divine will, he had omitted fully performing the &s;ervice required of him, by not vi&s;iting the few Friends in Holland: yet he was mercifully pre&s;erved, and after a time of deep exerci&s;e, rai&s;ed again to &s;ing of the mercies and loving kindne&s;s of God on the banks of deliver|ance.</P>
<P>HE &s;everal times, with other Friends appointed to that &s;ervice, vi&s;ited the fami|lies of Friends in this city, and between the years 1757 and 1760, being accompanied by our friend John Pemberton, he vi&s;ited the families of Friends generally within, the limits of our meeting; which weighty exerci&s;ing &s;ervice, he was enabled to per|form to our edification and &s;atisfaction. After which, he was frequently engaged
<PB N="viii" REF="012565_0007_0F8B15C76B193BD0">
to excite Friends to this u&s;eful and edify|ing practice.</P>
<P>IN the twelfth month, 1760, he &s;et out on a vi&s;it to the meetings in the we&s;tern parts of this province, and from thence in Maryland, Virginia, and North and South-Carolina, and returned in the &s;ixth month following; &s;ince which he fre|quently vi&s;ited many of the meetings near home, and &s;ome as far as Long-i&s;land, and other parts of the province of New-York. Within the la&s;t two years, he vi&s;ited the families of Friends of &s;ome of the meetings in We&s;t-Jer&s;ey, in the city of New-York, and part of Long-I&s;land; and after his return from this &s;ervice, with great peace and &s;atisfaction, he ex|pre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ion that he was now clear of all places, and that his &s;tay here was near over;&mdash;having an evidence, that he had been faithfully concerned from his youth to fear and &s;erve God.</P>
<P>HIS chief labour and religious exer|ci&s;es were in this city, where he was a di|ligent attender of all our meetings, and
<PB N="ix" REF="012565_0008_0F8B15C82C592640">
often on committees appointed on the &s;ervices of the church; in which he was &s;olid and weighty in &s;pirit, waiting for the &s;pringing up of life, being &s;teadily concerned both in and out of meetings, to live near the divine fountain: Thus he was very frequently qualified, and en|abled to &s;tir up the pure mind, and to re|count the gracious dealings of God to Mankind, and as a faithful emba&s;&s;ador to warn the negligent to flee from the wrath to come, and to excite the people to bring forth fruits an&s;werable to the great mercies graciou&s;ly be&s;towed on us; and was &s;ometimes con&s;trained to declare in a prophetic manner, a day of trial, in divers in&s;tances, very &s;hortly before &s;uch a &s;ea|&s;on came to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>HE was of late deeply exerci&s;ed in con&s;ideration of the evils of the hor&s;e races, &s;tage plays, drunkenne&s;s, and o|ther gro&s;s enormities encouraged and in|crea&s;ing in this city; clo&s;ely exhorting our youth again&s;t tho&s;e pernicious and de&s;tructive devices of the enemy of man|kind; and under the awful &s;en&s;e that God
<PB N="x" REF="012565_0009_0F8B15C93A29CD10">
will judge and puni&s;h the wicked and evil doers, he was often fervent in public &s;up|plications, that the Lord would lengthen out the day of his merciful vi&s;itation, and yet try the people longer; which &s;ea&s;ons were &s;olemn and humblingly affecting; manife&s;ting, that although he was very clo&s;e and &s;harp in reproof again&s;t evil, yet mo&s;t tenderly concerned, that the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors of the righteous law of God might be prevailed with to repent, re|turn, and live.</P>
<P>HIS love for the ri&s;ing generation was very great; which he manife&s;ted by his af|fectionate notice of them, and e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who were religiou&s;ly inclined, and his hou&s;e was open to receive &s;uch, his conver&s;ation with them being &s;ea&s;oned with grace, and his coun&s;el in&s;tructive and helpful to tho&s;e who had &s;eeking de&s;ires after the knowledge of truth, often lov|ingly inviting them to come, ta&s;te, and &s;ee, that the Lord is good; greatly de|&s;iring, that all who profe&s;s the truth, might walk agreeable to its dictates and be led thereby, as our worthy predece&s;|&s;ors
<PB N="xi" REF="012565_0010_0F8B15C9ECC3F218">
were, into that meekne&s;s, humility, and godly &s;implicity and plainne&s;s, which rendered them con&s;picuous and &s;hining examples, and that none might re&s;t &s;hort of the enjoyment of the life of religion, his zeal being great again&s;t &s;uch, who have the form of godline&s;s, and by their actions manife&s;t they have not the pow|er thereof;&mdash;and he often fervently ad|vis'd and cautioned tho&s;e who are eager|ly pur&s;uing the world, and by the for|feiting cares, and gra&s;ping after <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> trea&s;ures, fru&s;trate the good purpo&s;e of the vi&s;itation of divine grace to them, and clo&s;ely reminded tho&s;e, who in their &s;mall beginnings were low and humble, that now they were abundantly favoured, they &s;hould not &s;et their affections on things below, but remember the rock from whence they were hewn;&mdash;and his concern was great that tho&s;e who had the glad tidings of the go&s;pel to publi&s;h, might be true examples to the flock, and adorn the doctrine they had to deliver by a circum&s;pect life and conver&s;ation, and where any by not &s;teadily keeping to that which would have pre&s;erved them,
<PB N="xii" REF="012565_0011_0F8B15CD594C5568">
had involved them&s;elves in difficulties, either by letting their minds out to the gains and profits of this world, or other|wi&s;e, his travail was great for &s;uch that they might be brought through, and eve|ry cloud and mi&s;t removed.</P>
<P>HE was much employed in vi&s;iting the &s;ick and afflicted, to whom he admi|ni&s;tred his &s;piritual advice and experience, and often engaged in humble prayer for their &s;upport; and in the di&s;tributing to the nece&s;&s;itous according to his circum|&s;tances, he manife&s;ted his benevolent di&s;|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>AS he had been many years under great exerci&s;e and &s;uffering of &s;pirit on account of the &s;lavery of the poor Africans, and frequently bore te&s;timony again&s;t that unrighteous gain of oppre&s;&s;ion, he was of late &s;omewhat relieved, as he found the eyes of the people become more open to &s;ee the iniquity of the practice; and he died in faith, that the light of the go&s;pel will &s;o generally prevail, that the profe&s;|&s;ors of chri&s;tianity will find it their duty
<PB N="xiii" REF="012565_0012_0F8B15CD79130DB0">
to re&s;tore to the&s;e people their natural right to liberty, and to in&s;truct them in the principles of the chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P>ON the fifth day of the fifth month, he was violently &s;eized with the bilious cholic, and continued in great pain &s;eve|ral days; but afterwards being &s;omewhat ea&s;ier, he was at our morning and even|ing Meetings on Fir&s;tday, the thirteenth of the month, in which he was much fa|voured in his public mini&s;try, and expre&s;&s;|ed that he thought his time would not be long with us. After this day's labour, he was again confined, yet being a little recovered he as at our meeting on Fifth|day, the twenty-fourth of the month, which being &s;mall, he expre&s;&s;ed his &s;or|row for it, and encouraged Friends to diligence in the attendance of week day meetings, the benefit of a faithful di&s;|charge of duty therein being great;&mdash; the next day he was at our monthly meeting, and to his own and our admi|ration was enabled to &s;tay through both our &s;ittings, though the la&s;t of them was longer than u&s;ual, and he afterwards ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="xiv" REF="012565_0013_0F8B15CE2F43D698">
that he thought him&s;elf better in the meeting than when out;&mdash;it was a &s;ea|&s;on of divine favour, and &s;ome weigh|ty matters being before the meeting, he with great openne&s;s &s;poke pertinently and clearly to them, encouraging Friends to the &s;upporting and maintaining our chri&s;tian te&s;timony, again&s;t all that is con|trary to it: This was the la&s;t public meet|ing he was at, being the next morning early &s;eized with a renewed attack of the &s;ame di&s;order, which increa&s;ed on him &s;everal days, and was &s;o fixed, that all the endeavours of &s;everal &s;kilful phy&s;ici|ans and tender nur&s;es, were not effec|tual to remove it, tho' in &s;ome mea&s;ure to mitigate the pain, that he &s;uffered much, not being able to lie down in his bed &s;everal weeks, yet thro' all he was mercifully &s;upported, in much re&s;ignati|on, and patience, rather inclining, if it was the Lord's will, to be relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>FOR two or three weeks before his &s;ickne&s;s, he appeared very de&s;irous of &s;ettling every thing he had to do re&s;pect|ing the affairs of this life, and de&s;ired a
<PB N="xv" REF="012565_0014_0F8B15CEF0BB2C88">
Friend to review and tran&s;cribe the &s;hort memoirs he hath left of his travels and religious &s;ervices, and to write his will, which he executed the day before he was fir&s;t taken &s;ick, and then appeared ea&s;y in his mind.</P>
<P>DURING the time of his &s;ickne&s;s he often expre&s;&s;ed his concern lea&s;t his Friends &s;hould be too anxious for his re|covery, &s;aying, if he &s;hould live longer, and thro' any human frailty or infirmity occa&s;ion any reproach, it would be a cau&s;e of &s;orrow to them.</P>
<P>BY the de&s;ire of his Friends who attend|ed him, he rode out &s;everal times, tho' not without much difficulty, and &s;pent the two la&s;t days of his life at the hou&s;es of two of his intimate Friends. As he drew near his end, the &s;trength of his love to mankind in general, and his Friends in particular, evidently increa&s;ed, much de&s;iring the pro&s;perity of truth, and when a meeting time came had an ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire to be with Friends, and parti|cularly the day before his departure.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="012565_0015_0F8B15D0164CC168">DURING his &s;ickne&s;s, he frequently expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a very &s;ea&s;onable, in|&s;tructive, and affecting manner; and the evening of the Fir&s;tday before he dyed, &s;everal Friends coming in to &s;ee him, he &s;poke a con&s;iderable time to them, having before been de&s;irous of &s;uch an opportuni|ty of the company of his Friends, to &s;it down and wait upon God, which was his great delight.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t day of his life he &s;pent at the hou&s;e of his Friend I&s;rael Pemberton, at Germantown, and was unu&s;ually free and chearful, even till ten o'clock at night, when he undre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and went in|to bed, remarking on lying down, that he had not before been able to do &s;o, for five weeks or upwards, and he &s;oon after fell a&s;leep, but in a &s;hort time was awak|ened by the return of pain and difficulty of breathing, which thro' his illne&s;s he had been much afflicted with, &s;o that he was oblig'd to &s;et up in bed, and thus continued, at intervals freely conver&s;ing with our &s;aid Friend, who &s;at up with him, and he expre&s;&s;ed his great thankful|ne&s;s
<PB N="xvii" REF="012565_0016_0F8B15D0853C9380">
that his head was pre&s;erved free from pain and his under&s;tanding clear, and that though it had been a time of clo&s;e trial and deep probation, he could &s;ay he felt the evidence of divine &s;upport &s;till to at|tend him.&mdash;After which, his pains increa&s;|ing he got up and dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and walking about the room &s;ometime, &s;at down in an ea&s;y chair, in which he fell into a &s;weet &s;leep, and in about three hours de|parted without &s;igh or groan.</P>
<P>THUS died this righteous man, who having fought the good &s;ight and kept the faith, fini&s;hed his cour&s;e in full unity with us, and univer&s;ally beloved by his fellow citizens, on the twenty eighth day of the &s;ixth month, 1770, in the 62d year of his age and 43d of his mini&s;try. His body was the next day attended by a large num|ber of people of divers religious denomi|nations to our meeting hou&s;e, and after|wards interred in Friends burial ground in this city.</P>

<HEAD>DANIEL STANTON's ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE, TRAVELS AND LABOURS IN THE Service of the GOSPEL.</HEAD>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>His Birth and Parentage;&mdash;Apprentice&s;hip; &mdash;fir&s;t coming forth in the Mini&s;try;&mdash; and fir&s;t Journey to <HI>Rhode-i&s;land;</HI>&mdash;his marriage and &s;econd Journey to <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN a grateful &s;en&s;e of the many helps and great goodne&s;s of the Almigh|ty to my &s;oul, whereby he has been plea&s;ed from my young years to incline my heart to fear and &s;erve him; it is on my mind to leave &s;ome account of my life, travels, and experience; wi&s;hing it may be a means to &s;tir up the pure mind in any, to obey the will of the Lord, and to &s;erve him, while they have time and

opportunity to perform the &s;ame; for he is worthy to be had in everla&s;ting remem|brance, and is a good rewarder of all the &s;incere in heart; although they may have tribulations on the earth, they have al&s;o the company of Chri&s;t our dear redeemer, who promi&s;ed to be with his di&s;ciples to the end of the world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The place and time of his birth.</NOTE>BY the account I have had, I was born in the year 1708, in Philadelphia, in the province of Penn&s;ylvania, of hone&s;t pa|rents, Daniel and Abigail Stanton, and it was my hard lot &s;oon to be deprived of them both; my father I never &s;aw, he be|ing lo&s;t at Sea &s;ometime before I was born; and my mother died when I was a child, &s;o that I have but little remembrance of her.</P>
<P>AFTER her death, I met with great hard&s;hips, both of body and mind, being de&s;titute of parents, and of brother or &s;i&s;|ter, that I was in a lonely &s;tate, and went to live at &s;everal places a &s;hort time, the la&s;t of which (before I was put apprentice) was in New-Jer&s;ey, with my mother's brother; during which time, I went
<PB N="3" REF="012565_0019_0F8B15D366A6C680">
through great difficulties, too tedious to mention.</P>
<P>I LIVED there &s;everal years, and had no opportunity to go to any place of reli|gious wor&s;hip; but the lord was plea&s;ed by his grace and good vi&s;itation, to ope|rate on my mind, that I was made to dread and fear the great almighty Being, and it was given me to know, that
<Q>God is a &s;pirit, and they who wor&s;hip him, mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and truth;</Q>
and through the ble&s;&s;ed knowledge of <HI>God</HI> by his holy &s;pirit, I had great reproof in my own brea&s;t for &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and dreaded to &s;peak bad words, or to do what was evil, and was brought by inward conviction to mourn, and &s;eek for mercy for my &s;oul; and at a time when I heard of the &s;uffering of my dear Saviour on the cro&s;s, and how he &s;uffered unto death, my heart was broken before the Lord, and I went alone and wept, being much affect|ed with a &s;en&s;e of his &s;uffering by that hard hearted people, <HI>the Jews,</HI> and of his being crucified:&mdash;Great was the goodne&s;s of the Almighty to me, in giving me a
<PB N="4" REF="012565_0020_0F8B15D52B59C358">
&s;en&s;e of many things appertaining to God|line&s;s, in the time of this tender vi&s;itation; and I found by the divine witne&s;s in my|&s;elf, that if I would be a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, I mu&s;t take up my cro&s;s daily, to that which di&s;plea&s;eth God; he being greatly to be feared and obeyed, and was worthy of the deepe&s;t reverence that my &s;oul, bo|dy and &s;trength could a&s;cribe to his all powerful name.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH it was hard to the natu|ral part to become &s;lain to the recreations and plea&s;ures of this life; fervent were my cries and &s;eeking after the ways of the lord, and I thought much of eternity in another world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His fir&s;t at|dendance of meetings for religi|ous wor|&s;hip.</NOTE>I HAD heard of many forms of wor&s;hip, but had no opportunity to be with the people for that &s;ervice to God, which was a great trouble to my mind; but at one time I a&s;ked leave to go and &s;ee a relation, with an intention for him to &s;hew me the way to the meeting of Friends, which was held at New-town in Gloce&s;ter county; he was loath to take the pains to accompany

me, not knowing the &s;olid de&s;ire of my mind; but through per&s;ua&s;ion, I prevail|ed with him to go with me to the meet|ing, where I was more de&s;irous to get &s;ome good, than to be &s;een of men. We &s;at in a part of the meeting together, where we were not much noticed by any that I know of, and in this ble&s;&s;ed oppor|tunity, through the power of truth, and the good te&s;timony of that dear &s;ervant of Chri&s;t, <HI>John E&s;taugh,</HI> being attended with the authority of the word of life, my heart was greatly contrited and my &s;pirit baptized in the pre&s;ence of God, it was a joyful day of good tidings to my poor &s;eeking &s;oul, and the eminent and power|ful advice, that did attend that worthy in&s;trument in the Lord's hand for my &s;al|vation, has been like

When this friendly man returned on &s;hore, we went with him to his hou&s;e, being an inn; where we were civilly en|tertained, he took care of our che&s;ts and cloathing, and provided us with hor&s;es, and a guid to conduct us to Cork, being about ten miles; when we got there, be|ing &s;trangers, we were at a lo&s;s to find our Friends; we alighted at a public-hou&s;e, and went in and got &s;ome refre&s;hment; my companion inquired of a man in the hou&s;e after our Friends in the town, who an&s;wered, that there were a great many of the brethren lived there; he was de&s;ired to go to one of them, and inform him that we wanted to &s;peak with him; in a &s;hort time he brought one of our Friends, nam|ed Richard Allen, at the &s;ight of whom I was well plea&s;ed, and he lovingly took us to his hou&s;e, where &s;oon after came A|braham Fuller, and another Friend, who a&s;ked for our certificates, which they read and were &s;atisfied; our Friend A|braham Fuller inviting us to his hou&s;e, we went with him, and made it our home, while I &s;taid in Cork; we were favoured that evening with the company of &s;everal

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The TESTIMONY of the MONTHLY MEETING of FRIENDS in Philadelphia, concerning our be|loved Friend and Brother, BENJAMIN TROTTER, who was born in this City, in the ninth Month of the Year, 1699.</HEAD>
<P>HE was one whom the Lord early vi&s;ited, and reached unto by the reproofs of his Divine Light and Grace, for tho&s;e youthful vanities and cor|rupt conver&s;ation, which by nature he was prone to and pur&s;ued, to the grief of his pious mother, who was religiou&s;ly con|cerned to re&s;train him, but as he became obedient to the renewed vi&s;itations of the heavenly call, denying him&s;elf of tho&s;e things he was reproved for, he not only learned to cea&s;e from doing evil, but to live in the practice of doing well; and continuing faithful, became an example of plainne&s;s and &s;elf-denial, for which he &s;uffered much &s;coffing and mocking of tho&s;e who had been his companions in fol|ly; yet he neither fainted nor was turned a&s;ide by the reproaches of the ungodly, which thus fell to his lot, for his plain te&s;|timony again&s;t their evil conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="012565_0201_0F8B15436C6101F8">IN the twenty-&s;ixth year of his age, he appeared in the work of the mini&s;try, and laboured therein in much plainne&s;s and Godly &s;incerity, adorning the doctrine he preached, by a humble circum&s;pect life and conver&s;ation, being exemplary in his diligence and indu&s;try to labour hone&s;tly for a livelihood, though often in much bodily infirmity and weakne&s;s, de&s;iring, as he &s;ometimes expre&s;&s;ed, that he might owe no man any thing but love. His in|offen&s;ive openne&s;s and affability, drawing many of different denominations to con|ver&s;e with him, he had &s;ome &s;ea&s;onable op|portunities of admoni&s;hing and rebuking the evil doer and evil &s;peaker, which he did, in the plainne&s;s of an upright zeal for the promotion of piety and virtue, temper|ed with true brotherly kindne&s;s and cha|rity; re&s;pecting not the per&s;on of the proud nor of the rich, becau&s;e of his riches, but with Chri&s;tian freedom, declaring the truth to his neighbour, and was thus in private as well as public, a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>IN his public mini&s;try he was zealous a|gain&s;t errors both in principle and practice, and con&s;tantly concerned to pre&s;s the ne|&s;&s;ity of obedience to the Principle of Divine Grace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. ii. 11.</NOTE> a manife&s;tation of which is given to every man; knowing, from his own ex|perience, that it bringeth &s;alvation to all them that obey and follow it's teachings

and was frequently enabled with energy and power to bear te&s;timony to the out|ward coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his miraculous birth, his holy example in his life and precepts, and his death and &s;ufferings at Jeru&s;alem, by which he hath obtained eternal redemption for us.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. ix. 12 &amp; 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN his public te&s;timony a little be|fore his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, he expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ions, that his time among us would be &s;hort, and fervently exhorted to watchfulne&s;s and care, to keep our lamps trimmed, and our lights burning, and urged the nece&s;&s;ity of being prepared to meet the bridegroom, as not knowing at what hour he will come.</P>
<P>HE travelled &s;everal times, and vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meetings of Friends in this province and New-Jer&s;ey, and &s;ome in the adjacent provinces, but was not much from home; being upwards of forty years a diligent attender of our religious meet|ings in this city, zealou&s;ly concerned for the maintaining our Chri&s;tian di&s;cipline in meekne&s;s and true charity, careful in the exerci&s;e of that part of pure religion, vi&s;iting the widow and fatherle&s;s in their afflictions, and often qualified to admi|ni&s;ter relief and con&s;olation to their de|jected minds.</P>

he was enabled to bear with exemplary patience and re&s;ignation, and particularly through his la&s;t illne&s;s, in which, for up|wards of &s;ix weeks, he underwent great difficulty and pain, being afflicted with the a&s;thma and drop&s;y, &s;o that he &s;uffered much, yet was never heard to utter a mur|mur or complaint, but frequently expre&s;|&s;ed his thankfulne&s;s, that he had not more pain, and often engaged in prayer, that he might be pre&s;erved in patience to the end, which was graciou&s;ly granted him; &s;o that he was capable of &s;peaking to the comfort and edification of tho&s;e who vi&s;it|ed him; and from the fervent love of the brethren, which evidently appeared thro' his life, and mo&s;t con&s;picuou&s;ly during his la&s;t illne&s;s, and even in the hour of his death, we have a well-grounded a&s;|&s;urance that he is pa&s;&s;ed unto life, and hath received the reward of the Righte|ous.</P>
