<P N="1">1. THE fir&s;t divi&s;ion contains the fir&s;t three hundred years of chri&s;tianity, which may be accounted the mo&s;t refined and pure&s;t time, both as to faith and manners, that the chri&s;tian church has been honored with; for that within this &s;pace, is contained the mini&s;try of the apo&s;tles and holy evangeli&s;ts, and other eminent per&s;ons authorized by them; and &s;uch others who &s;ucceed|ed in office-tru&s;t through the &s;everal ages, within the &s;pace before named. This was the time of an immen&s;e effu&s;ion of the Spirit of God upon the world, when there was &s;uch a flux and inundation of the waters from the &s;anctuary, mentioned, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 47. This was the age of miracles; a time of extraordinary gifts, and when grace and true piety was in the greate&s;t elevation. Chri&s;tian religion was now a dangerous bu&s;ine&s;s; every man that took it up, lay
<PB N="4" REF="012626_0003_0F8B8F030AF28938">
down his life, honor and fortune at &s;take; he that owns Chri&s;t, mu&s;t bid defiance to all the celebrated deities of the Roman empire; and thereby run counter to the religi|on of the imperial court. So that rationally we may ex|pect to find the churches of Chri&s;t in the pure&s;t capacity they were ever in; in all points, both of principles and practice. That whatever their government was if they continue the &s;ame from the days of the apo&s;tles, we may fairly conclude it to be authentic, and agreable with their grand and original copy. It is mo&s;t apparent, that the churches in tho&s;e ages, were under too good an influence internally, and the eye of too direful a guard, externally to prevaricate with God, in the known principles of their order, any more than in their faith, though they were not without errors. Two or three hundred years, is a long time in the world, to keep up our con&s;tant mode and cu&s;|tom, either in religious or civil affairs among&s;t men, who are &s;o inclined to err, and apt to change their fa&s;hions; <HI>Nam e&s;t Natura hominum Novitatis Avida,</HI> That for the churches through tho&s;e many ages and in their &s;everal communities, to agree in their di&s;cipline among&s;t them|&s;elves; and not e&s;&s;entially to differ from tho&s;e churches that were truely apo&s;tolical, invincibly infers, that their original was divine. But this will appear more plainly when we have made and fini&s;hed our &s;urvey.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd grand divi&s;ion of time, contains the &s;pace of the next twelve hundred years, downward, more or le&s;s; within which circuit is included the commencement &amp; pro|gre&s;s of a direful apo&s;tacy, both as to wor&s;hip, and govern|ment in the churches. Some &s;ymptoms of the&s;e things were ri&s;ing within the former divi&s;ion of time; but in this they grew a great pace, and to that degree, that the chri&s;|tian world became a mo&s;t notorious apo&s;tate. For as we have it in the idea of the reformation, the great Lord of time allowed a &s;pace, wearing the denomination of time, times, and half a time: or in plainer expre&s;&s;ions, twelve hundred and &s;ixty years; in which &s;pace, all the effects of a horrible apo&s;tacy made a very <HI>Gehennon</HI> of that which was called Chri&s;tendom. And &s;ays Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> (in his preface, to the inquiry, into the original of the churches) <HI>Ambros</HI> judg|ed, that it was the pride, or ambition of the doctors of the church, which introduced the alteration in its order. And
<PB N="5" REF="012626_0004_0F8B8F042D49B830">
moreover &s;ays the doctor, &s;omewhat after this manner, viz. 'The ambition of church rulers, in the fourth and fifth centuries openly proclaimed it&s;elf to the &s;candal of the chri&s;|tian religion; for that their intere&s;t led them to a devia|tion from the order and di&s;cipline of the church according to its fir&s;t in&s;titution': For that the directions given about it in &s;cripture, make it a matter &s;o weighty in it&s;elf, and attended with &s;o many difficulties, it being laid under &s;uch &s;evere interdictions of lordly power, or &s;eeking either of wealth or dignity; that it's no plea&s;ant thing to fle&s;h and blood, to engage in the conduct, and over&s;ight of Chri&s;t's volunteers; to bear with their manners; to exerci&s;e pa|tience towards them in all their infirmities; and in all their weakne&s;&s;es, to continue a high valuation for them, as the flock of God, which he hath purcha&s;ed with his own blood: All this requires abundance of &s;elf-denial; and if &s;o, then it's no wonder, that many of their prelates were willing gradually to extricate them&s;elves out of this unea&s;y condition; and embrace all opportunities of introducing another order into the churches, that might tend more to the exaltation of their own power and dignity. And this was done accordingly; for the bi&s;hops by their arbitrary rules &s;hared the flock of Chri&s;t among&s;t them&s;elves, and that without the con&s;ent of the people, as though they had conquered them by the &s;word. For thus they divide the &s;poil. This bi&s;hop &s;ay they, &s;hall have &s;uch a &s;hare and number of them under his power; and that other bi&s;hop &s;hall have &s;o many; and &s;o far &s;hall the juri&s;diction of one extend, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d &s;o far another; that they &s;oon canton out the whole Roman empire under a few patriarchs and head men. The&s;e things were the &s;ubject of their decrees and laws, which (tho&s;e of Chri&s;t's being thrown by) were now become a rule for the churches. But yet neither did the bi&s;hops long keep within tho&s;e bounds and limits, which their more mode&s;t ambition had at fir&s;t pre&s;cribed unto them; but went on, and took occa&s;ion from the&s;e be|ginnings to contend among&s;t them&s;elves about pre-eminen|cy, dignity, and power: In which conte&s;t, the bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> at length remained ma&s;ter of the field; and &s;o <HI>Rome</HI> obtained the &s;econd conque&s;t of the world. And then his holine&s;s the head of it came to ride admiral of all the Sees; and then &s;oon became lord of heaven and earth by the
<PB N="6" REF="012626_0005_0F8B8F04A71BB800">
&s;ame rule of proce&s;s which brought him to his high tru&s;t. Hence, Query. What can't wakeful ambition, learning and fraud do, if jointly agreed, at rifling the greate&s;t trea|&s;ures bequeathed to mankind; e&s;pecially when the world is generally gotten into a &s;leepy fit.</P>
<P N="3">3. Towards the latter end of this &s;pace of time began a glorious reformation. Many famous per&s;ons, memorable in eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, being moved by the &s;pirit of God, and according to holy writ, led the way in the face of all danger; &s;uch has <HI>Wickliff,</HI> who openly decryed the pope, as the very antichri&s;t; in the fourteenth century, and others in that age. And in the next century <HI>Martin Luther</HI> pur&s;ued the reformation with great boldne&s;s, re&s;o|lution and con&s;tancy; this is that famous <HI>Luther,</HI> &s;ays my author, of whom they who acknowledge the lea&s;t, mu&s;t yet make as much as Dr. <HI>More</HI> makes of him; for &s;aith the Dr.
<Q>I cannot think &s;o very highly of <HI>Luther</HI> as &s;ome do; and yet I think him to have been a very happy in&s;trument in the hand of God, for the good of Chri&s;|tendom again&s;t the horrid enormities of the papal hyrarchy. And though he might not be allowed to be the <HI>Elias,</HI> the conductor and chariot of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as &s;ome have &s;tiled him; yet I think at lea&s;t he might be ac|counted a faithful po&s;tilion in that chariot, who was well accoutred with his wax boots, oiled coat, and hood; and who turned the hor&s;es no&s;es into a direct way from <HI>Babylon</HI> toward the ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of God, and held on in a good round trot, through thick and thin, not caring to be&s;pat|ter others in this high fogg, as he him&s;elf was finely be&s;pattered by others:</Q>
About which time <HI>Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Melancthon</HI> and other chri&s;tian heroes al&s;o li&s;ted into the &s;ame quarrel, and with great bravery and &s;elf denial went forward with the reformation. Yet after the endeavours of &s;uch men, and others without number, through &s;everal ages downward; the churches, which are called reformed, attained to a very imperfect reformation, as Dr. <HI>Increa&s;e Matther</HI> &s;ays. And the defect has not been &s;o much in doctrine, as in wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline. And notwith&s;tanding &s;ays the Dr. in this re&s;pect al&s;o, &s;ome churches have gone beyond others. Now to come to what I aim at; the&s;e churches in <HI>New-England,</HI> as to their order and di&s;cipline have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all churches of the
<PB N="7" REF="012626_0006_0F8B8F06DA7C9808">
reformation. And under the head of di&s;cipline, it &s;eems to me, that Chri&s;t the captain of &s;alvation, has given out his word to the&s;e churches, as to his troops coming up in the reer of time; and his word of command is&mdash;as you were; make good the old front; or place your &s;elves in that regimental order, which the primitive churches were in whil&s;t they march't under my banners, and encountred the devil in their heathen per&s;ecutors for the fir&s;t three hundred years. For that the churches in <HI>New-England,</HI> and the primitive churches are eminently parallel in their government. Tho&s;e fir&s;t ages of the church it is certain were many times much annoyed with many pe&s;tilent and damnable here&s;ies; and many u&s;ages in wor&s;hip, too &s;uper&s;titious crept in among&s;t them; yet they continued in the con&s;titution of their church order very uniform and apo&s;tolical; and it is very obvious that the&s;e churches in this wilderne&s;s, in the e&s;&s;entials of government; are every way parallel to them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall repre&s;ent this bu&s;ine&s;s by a collection of parellel notes out of &s;everal authors of unque&s;tionable veracity; and &s;hall principally follow the guidance of one who has concealed his name; and &s;tiles his treati&s;e, 'An inquiry into the con&s;titution, di&s;cipline, unity and wor&s;hip of the primitive churches.' This author in his preface gives this fair account of his doings; &s;ays he, <HI>What I have written I have wholly collected out of the genuine, and unque&s;tionably authentick writings of tho&s;e ages</HI>; meaning &s;uch as writ in, or of the three fir&s;t centuries of chri&s;tianity. And &s;ays he, <HI>I have been every way hone&s;t and unbia&s;t.</HI> And being well a&s;&s;ured of his fidelity; I &s;hall endeavour to imitate his faithfulne&s;s, in tran&s;cribing what I find in him &s;uiting my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. And I &s;hall be well and &s;ufficiently furni&s;hed when I have laid before the reader the notion which the ancients had of the church in its con&s;tituent parts both of officers and people, with the &s;everal authorities, powers, rights, immunities and prerogatives belonging unto each. And if we find that the primitive churches in their order and di&s;cipline, did exactly agree in the e&s;&s;enti|als of government; with the churches in <HI>New-England</HI>; we may rationally then conclude that if they were apo&s;to|lical, &s;o are we.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Church.</HEAD>
<P>TO pa&s;s over all other ob&s;ervations, the mo&s;t u&s;ual and common acceptation of the word <HI>Church,</HI> of which we mu&s;t chiefly treat, is that of a particular church; which con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;ociety of chri&s;tians, meeting together in one place, under their proper pa&s;tors, for the performance of religious wor&s;hip, and the exerci&s;ing of chri&s;tian di&s;cipline. This de&s;cription of a church is a|greable with the <HI>Idiom</HI> both of &s;cripture and antiquity. Thus <HI>Tertullian,</HI> who lived about the end of the &s;econd century, gives us an account of the &s;tate, order and wor|&s;hip of the churches. (<HI>Apol. ad Gen. Cap.</HI> 39.) The de&s;cription of a church he fir&s;t lays down in the&s;e words, <HI>viz. Corpus &s;umus de Con&s;cientia Religionis, et Di&s;ciplinae Unitate, et Spei Foedere.</HI> We are a body united in the con&s;cience of religion, or for the con&s;ciencious ob&s;ervation of the duties of religion; by an agreement in di&s;cipline, and in a covenant of hope. For whereas &s;uch a body, or religious &s;ociety could not be united but by a covenant; he calls it a covenant of hope, becau&s;e the principal re&s;pect therein was had unto the things hoped for. This religi|ous body, or &s;ociety thus united by covenant, did meet together in the &s;ame a&s;&s;embly, or congregation. For &s;ays he, <HI>Corpus &s;umus, Coimus in Coetum, et Congregationem ut ad Deum, &amp;c.</HI> We are a body, and meet in an a&s;&s;embly, and congregation, to offer up our prayers unto God, and attend the duties of the chri&s;tian religion. So <HI>Iraeneus</HI> al&s;o in the &s;econd century, tells us, <HI>That &s;ome of the bre|thren, and &s;ometimes the whole church of &s;ome certain place,&mdash; by fa&s;ting and prayer have rai&s;ed the dead.</HI> Thus our own platform agrees in &s;en&s;e with the opinion of the ancients. <HI>Plat. Ch.</HI> 2. <HI>Sect.</HI> 6. <HI>A congregational church, is by the in|&s;titution of Chri&s;t, a part of the militant church, con&s;i&s;ting of a company of &s;aints by calling, united into one body by an holy covenant,</HI> &amp;c. But as to the independency, or real di&s;|tinction between church and church; this will more clearly appear in what follows. Therefore I &s;hall proceed to con&s;ider the con&s;tituent parts of a church, as divided,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="9" REF="012626_0008_0F8B8F09769436B8">1. Into the people who compo&s;ed the body of the church, called the elect, or the called and &s;anctified by the will of God; and &s;ometimes they are called the bre|thren, becau&s;e of their brotherly love, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. Into tho&s;e per&s;ons who were &s;et apart for office, or for a peculiar and eccle&s;ia&s;tical improvement. And each party under this di&s;tribution, had their particular immuni|ties and employments. And under the&s;e heads, I &s;hall confine the di&s;cour&s;e to a parallel in the e&s;&s;entials in go|vernment or church order, between the churches of Chri&s;t in the fir&s;t ages of chri&s;tianity, and the churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> as &s;ettled by their platform.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL proceed to di&s;tribute and enumerate the operations and immunities of the churches.</P>
<P N="1">1. With relation to the peculiar acts of the officers.</P>
<P N="2">2. The peculiar acts of the laity, or fraternity.</P>
<P N="3">3. The joint acts of them both; as performing the work and bu&s;ine&s;s of an organic church, or compleat corpora|tion. And,</P>
<P N="4">4. I &s;hall la&s;tly make &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon the union of di&s;tinct churches, by acts of &s;i&s;terly fellow&s;hip or com|munion. And hereby I &s;hall compleat the parallel, in the e&s;&s;entials of order, between the primitive churches, and tho&s;e of this country.</P>
<P N="1">1. The peculiar acts of the officers or clergy. Under this head might be con&s;idered the functions of every parti|cular order, and degree of the clergy; which we may &s;ay were according to the pure&s;t antiquity, but three, viz. bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts or pre&s;byters, and deacons. I &s;hall princi|pally con&s;ider the bi&s;hop as the chief officer in tru&s;t and dignity, in the primitive church. And in order to it,</P>
<P N="1">1. In general ob&s;erve, that though there were &s;ome di&s;|tinctions in point of a tetular dignity and degree between a bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter; yet they were really equal in order, and in the nature of their tru&s;t. For that in an eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;en&s;e, bi&s;hop and pre&s;byters are &s;ynonimous terms, &s;etting forth the &s;ame office; and &s;ignify no more but an elder, a pa&s;tor, ruler, or over&s;eer of a church.
<PB N="10" REF="012626_0009_0F8B8F0BA90553D8">
<HI>Ignatius</HI> calls the apo&s;tles them&s;elves the pre&s;byters of the church; and <HI>Theodoret</HI> renders the rea&s;on of the appella|tion, for &s;aith he,
<Q>The holy &s;criptures called the chief men of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the &s;enate or elder&s;hip.</Q>
<HI>Wil&s;. Dict.</HI> And indeed according to the apo&s;tle him&s;elf, pre&s;byters, or elders, and bi&s;hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, are plainly terms of office; and of equal &s;ignification. As in <HI>Tit.</HI> i. 5, 7. <HI>For this cau&s;e left I thee in</HI> Crete, <HI>that thou &s;houlde&s;t&mdash;ordain elders&mdash;For a bi&s;hop mu&s;t be blamele&s;s, as the &s;teward of God,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In this di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our&s;e I &s;hall repre&s;ent the bi&s;hop in the &s;en&s;e of the primitive chur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hes, as head and chief officer of the church; for according to <HI>Cyprian,</HI> there was but one bi&s;hop, &s;trickly &s;o called, in a church at a time, though at the &s;ame time there were many elders or pre&s;byters in the &s;ame church; and the bi&s;hop in a peculiar manner was related to his flock, as a pa&s;tor to his &s;heep and a parent to his children. <HI>Cyp. Epi&s;t.</HI> 38. &sect; 1. <HI>p.</HI> 90. And the titles of this &s;upreme church officer, are mo&s;t of them reckoned up in one place, in <HI>Cyp. Epi&s;t.</HI> 96. <HI>viz.</HI> Bi&s;hop, pa&s;tor, pre&s;ident, governor, &s;uperintendant or prie&s;t. And this officer is he, which in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> is called, <HI>The angel of the church,</HI> as <HI>Origen</HI> thinks.</P>
<P N="2">2. We may con&s;ider more di&s;tinctly, the object of his care, or the dimen&s;ions of the bo&s;hops dioce&s;s. Its very obvious, that this great and &s;uperior officer, as has been &s;aid; had but one church under his pa&s;toral care. The dioce&s;&s;es government or dominion of the&s;e reverend pre|lates, are never (according to antiquity) &s;aid to contain churches, in the plural, but only a church, in the &s;ingular number. And the bi&s;hop was u&s;ually called the bi&s;hop of this or that church. As <HI>Tertullian</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Polycarp</HI> was or|dained bi&s;hop of the church of <HI>Smyrna, &amp;c.</HI> And more|ever it is accurately to be ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t frequent word u&s;ed to denominate the extent of the bi&s;hops care, or to &s;et out the limits of his dioce&s;s, was that of a pari&s;h. So in the &s;ynodical epi&s;tle of <HI>Irenaeus</HI> to <HI>Victor.</HI> The bi&s;hopricks of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> are called pari&s;hes: and in the hi&s;|tory of <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> the word is &s;o applied in &s;everal hundred pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es. It's very u&s;ual there to read of bi&s;hops of this and that pari&s;h. As the bi&s;hop of the pari&s;h in <HI>Alexan|dria,</HI> the bi&s;hop of the pari&s;h in <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> and in <HI>Corinth,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c. For that the word <HI>Paroikia,</HI> which we render <HI>pari&s;h,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="012626_0010_0F8B8F0C7A9C0B28">
&s;ignifies <HI>hou&s;ing,</HI> or <HI>living</HI> together. And in ordinary and civil u&s;e, it notes a village, &s;mall town, or part of a town, of people or per&s;ons dwelling together. And in a church &s;en&s;e it &s;ignifies a competent number of chri&s;tians dwelling near together, and having one bi&s;hop, pa&s;tor or mini&s;ter, or more &s;et over them; with whom they meet at one time or place, to wor&s;hip and &s;erve God. So that pari&s;h in this &s;en&s;e, is the &s;ame with a particular church or congregation. And this is plainly agreable with the &s;en&s;e, cu&s;tom and platform of <HI>New-England</HI> churches.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the bi&s;hops dioce&s;s exceeded not the bounds of a pari&s;h, or a &s;mall town, or part of a town, is very evident from the following demon&s;trations, according to antiquity.</P>
<P><HI>Demon&s;t.</HI> 1. For that all the people of a dioce&s;s did every Sunday, meet together in one place, to celebrate divine &s;ervice. Thus &s;aith <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr, (Apol.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 98.) All a&s;&s;emble together in one place, where the bi&s;hop preaches, and prays.</P>

<PB N="12" REF="012626_0011_0F8B8F0CDD7F9708">
whole dioce&s;s of the bi&s;hops did meet together to manage church affairs. Thus when the &s;chi&s;m of <HI>Felici&s;&s;imus,</HI> in the bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Carthage</HI> was to be debated, it was to be done according to the will of the people, and by the con&s;ent of the laity.

So that from the pre|mi&s;es, it is very evident, that that dioce&s;s cannot po&s;&s;ibly be more than one &s;ingle congregation; nor that church more than a congregational church, where all the people and members of that church meet together at one time, and in one place to pray together, to receive the &s;acrament together; a&s;&s;i&s;t at church-cen&s;ures together, and di&s;patch church affairs together.

Therefore at length &s;natch or take the whole bu&s;ine&s;s into their own hands; the people through their &s;upine negligence not much op|po&s;ing of them.

<P N="3">3. WE come nextly to con&s;ider the joint acts of officers and people, carrying on, as an organic body. And the&s;e peculiarly refer to the di&s;|cipline, and good government of the church. And tho' mini&s;terial tru&s;t (preci&s;ely con&s;idered) was &s;olely devolved on the officers; yet &s;till the fraternity &s;tood intere&s;ted in, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;hare in the juridical part of govern|ment, the whole church in ordinary ca&s;es were the judges which compo&s;ed the eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;i&s;tory. So that the power of the keys was &s;o lodged both in the bo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ops and people, as that each had a &s;hare to exerci&s;e and improve in joint acts of judicature, and thus the clergy and laity conjunctly made up that &s;upreme court which was in every pari&s;h, where all church offenders were tried, and when found guilty, were &s;entenced and condemned. That the laity did exerci&s;e judicial power in the church, is further evident from &s;everal te&s;timonies. As in that of <HI>Clemens Romanus. (Epi&s;t.</HI> 1. <HI>Ad Corinth,</HI> p. 69.) where he writes: <HI>Who will &s;ay according to the example of</HI> Mo&s;es, <HI>If &s;editions, contentions, and &s;chi&s;ms are happened becau&s;e of me, I will depart, I will go whither&s;oever you plea&s;e, and I will do what &s;hall be injoyned me by the people, &s;o the church of Chri&s;t be in peace.</HI> So <HI>Origen</HI> di&s;cribes a criminal ap|pearing be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re the whole church.

And to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, he writes of other delinquents; viz. That &s;uch matters &s;hould be adju&s;ted according to the ar|bitrament, and common council of the people. And that the lap&s;ed in admitting them to communion, &s;hould plead their cau&s;e before the clergy, and before all the people. And concerning &s;uch matters he writes to the people, that when it &s;hould plea&s;e God to re&s;tore peace to the church, and reduce him from exile, then the ca&s;e of the delinquents &s;hould be examined in their pre&s;ence, and according to their judgment. And <HI>Cyprian</HI> writes in another place, that all things were debated in common among&s;t them. And that whoever was excommunicated it was by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uf|frages of the people. And though the elders were princi|pally

concerned, in preparing ca&s;es for the churches cog|nizance; yet its plain that the deci&s;ive &s;uffrage was (in part) the prerogative of the people. To this purpo&s;e we have an in&s;tance in &s;ome that joined in the &s;chi&s;m of <HI>Novatus</HI>; who being &s;en&s;ible of their fault, came into the pre&s;bytery, and de&s;ired the churches peace; the pre&s;bytery accepted their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and propo&s;ed it to the whole church, who readily embraced it. Now it is to be ob|&s;erved, that agreably with the fore-cited practice of the primitive churches, our own platform has decided the que&s;tion concerning the &s;ubject, and exerci&s;e of govern|ment, <HI>Platf.

The ordinary power of government belongs only to the elders; and power of pri|vilege remaineth with the brother-hood, (as the power of judgment in matters of cen&s;ure, and and power of liberty in matters of liberty) thence it follows, that in an organic church, and right admini&s;tration, all church acts proceed after the manner of a mixt admini&s;tration, &s;o that no church act can be con&s;ummated, or perfected without the con&s;ent of both.</P>

<P N="4">4. I Shall nextly con&s;ider the fellow&s;hip and commu|nion that di&s;tinct churches had and held one with another.</P>
<P>It is very obvious by this time, (and he mu&s;t blind his own eyes that won't &s;ee it) that the primitive churches according to the account we have of their regiment for the fir&s;t three hundred years from Chri&s;t) were di&s;tinct, poli|tical bodies; and neither diocae&s;an, national, provincial nor cla&s;&s;ical, but properly congregational churches. And as &s;uch, were perfect and compleat &s;ocieties incorporate; &s;o that they had a power, and capacity of carrying on all church work within them&s;elves, and wanted not to borrow, or receive from others, for the &s;upport of their being, and &s;o were independent. Yet con&s;idering they were imperfect in their matter, and therefore to help forward their well-being, wanted the advantage of all good means; with the influence of the grace, love, knowledge, experience, wi&s;|dom, and coun&s;el of each other; &s;o they were dependent, and became mutually officious, and accountable each to other: &s;omewhat after the manner, as Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> di&s;|tingui&s;hes
<PB N="17" REF="012626_0016_0F8B8F120CA24890" MS="y">
on the independency, and dependency of go&s;|pel churches. <HI>Pol. lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. Says he, <HI>indepen|dency implies two things.</HI> Either,</P>
<P N="1">1. An ab&s;olute &s;upremacy, oppo&s;ed to &s;ubordination; and &s;o a particular church is not independent, it being ac|countable to civil government, &amp;c. And al&s;o to the con&s;o|ciation of churches. Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. Independency &s;ignifies a &s;ufficieny in its kind, for the attainment of its end. And in this &s;en&s;e, independency is oppo&s;ed to imperfection: And if we take it thus, then a particular church may be &s;aid to be independent, it be|ing &s;ufficient to attain the end it was in&s;tituted for; it having compleat power, when rightly con&s;tituted, to ex|erci&s;e all the ordinances of God. And thus we find that the primitive churches in this &s;en&s;e were independent churches: that is, every particular church had a &s;ufficient right, and power, without the concurrence and authority of any other church, to carry on the wor&s;hip of God, and exerci&s;e of di&s;cipline in their di&s;tinct &s;ociety. And yet as they were parts of the univer&s;al church, held them&s;elves obliged to a &s;uitable communion. And for the &s;upport of unity, love, and concord among&s;t them, and to advi&s;e about their common circum&s;tances and condition; and al&s;o to regulate their eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs within their general limits, for their mutual advantage; did therefore form them|&s;elves into &s;ynodical a&s;&s;emblies, &amp; and were governed in com|mon by them; for their &s;ynodical decrees, canons or in&s;tituti|ons, were accounted abligatory to all the churches, who had their repre&s;entatives in the &s;ynods. For indeed to what pur|po&s;e el&s;e did they draw up their re&s;olves, but for the good and benefit of the whole community. And it would have been very fruitle&s;s to have made weari&s;ome journeys, with great co&s;t and pains to determine &s;uch things, as they judged ex|pedient for the churches well-being; if after all, it were indifferent whether they were obeyed or no: or that when the whole was agreed, &s;ome &s;hould reluct, and remon&s;trate; and e&s;pecially when things were fairly &s;ettled by a joint &s;uffrage in &s;ynods, &s;ome &s;mall &s;et of wi&s;e men &s;hould hold them&s;elves wi&s;er than whole &s;ynods; and afterward &s;hould of their own heads in their more private apartments &s;et forward new &s;chemes, which in it&s;elf is di&s;orderly, and a way to keep the churches con&s;tantly fluctuating and wre&s;t|le&s;s

like the un&s;table ocean. And indeed, con&s;idering the regularity, wi&s;dom and union in &s;ynodical &s;ettlements, whil&s;t that all &s;orts of per&s;ons intere&s;ted, both officers and people having had their full liberty in debates, and their free votes and &s;uffrages, in drawing up the decrees and &s;et|tlements; it is a bold intru&s;ion, and little better than defy|ing and trampling under foot the unity, love, honor an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> authority of the churches, to run counter with &s;ynodical &s;ettlements, till they are fairly repealed by the like power which made the &s;ettlements.

<P>And the&s;e were bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters, deacons, and de|puted lay-men, in behalf of the people of their re&s;pective churches. At a great &s;ynod at <HI>Antioch,</HI> which condemned <HI>Paulus Samo&s;atenus,</HI> there were pre&s;ent bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters, deacons, and the church of God; that is lay-men, who repre&s;ented the people of their &s;everal churches. <HI>Eu&s;eb. l.</HI> 7. <HI>cap.</HI> 30.

by the in&s;titution of Chri&s;t belong to the brotherhood in particular churches. Dr. <HI>Mather's Order. Q.</HI> 11. I &s;hall conclude this head or demon&s;tration with the&s;e weigh|ty and &s;olemn words of the learned and famous Mr. <HI>Oakes,</HI> prae&s;ident of the college, in his election &s;ermon. Con&s;ider (&s;ays he) what will be the end of receeding, or making of a defection from the way of church government e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t us. I profe&s;s that I look upon the di&s;covery and &s;ettlement of the congregational way, as the boon, the gratuity, the largene&s;s of divine bounty, which the Lord graciou&s;ly be&s;towed on this people, that followed him into this wilderne&s;s, and who were &s;eperated from their bre|thren. Tho&s;e good people who came over had more love, zeal, and affectionate de&s;ire of communion with God, in pure wor&s;hip and ordinances, and did more in order to it, than others; and the Lord did more for them than for any people in the world, in &s;hewing them the pattern of his hou&s;e, and the truer &s;criptural-way of church govern|ment and admini&s;trations. God was certainly in a more than ordinary way pre&s;ent with his &s;ervants, in laying of our foundations; and in &s;ettling church-order, according to the will and appointment of Chri&s;t. Con&s;ider what will be the &s;ad i&s;&s;ue of revolting from the way fixed on to one extreme or to another, whether it be to pre&s;byteri|ani&s;m or browni&s;m. 'As for the pre&s;byterians, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that there are among&s;t them, as pious, learned, &s;ober, orthodox men, as the world affords; and that there is as much of the power of godline&s;s among that party, and of the &s;pirit of the good old puritans, as among any people in the world. And as for the ways of their church government, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in the day of it, it was a great &s;tep to reformation. The refor|mation in king <HI>Edward</HI>'s days, was a ble&s;&s;ed work, and the reformation of <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> was then a larger &s;tep, and in many re&s;pects purer than the other. And for my part, I fully believe that the congregational-way far exceeds both, and is the highe&s;t &s;tep that has been taken towards reformation; and for the &s;ub&s;tance of it, it is the very &s;ame way that was e&s;tabli&s;hed and practi&s;ed in the primitive times, according to the in&s;titution of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.' Thus ends my fir&s;t demon&s;tration in a fair paral|lel drawn up between the holie&s;t churches that ever were in

the world, and the churches of <HI>New-England</HI>; and however they may differ in their morals, they are very harmonious in their order. And con&s;idering that the former cannot rationally be thought but they derived their con&s;titution from the apo&s;tles, and &s;o it mu&s;t needs be of a divine ori|ginal: and if &s;o then the&s;e in <HI>New-England</HI> who are fa&s;hioned &s;o exactly like them, mu&s;t needs be of the &s;ame pedigree, &amp;c. But I &s;hall wave all improvement of the premi&s;es, and leave the whole to the &s;erious and judicious thoughts of every impartial reader, not doubting but he will find &s;ufficient evidence of the divine original of the&s;e churches in what has been &s;aid. And that I might now obtain a <HI>&s;uper&s;edeas,</HI> and forbear adding any further plea in their defence.

For if we &s;hould make a new <HI>&s;urvey</HI> of the con&s;titution before named under the brighte&s;t light of nature, there is no greater example of natural wi&s;dom in any &s;ettlement on earth; for the pre&s;ent and future &s;ecurity of human beings in all that is mo&s;t valuable and grand, than in this. That it &s;eems to me as though wi&s;e and provident nature by the dictates of right rea&s;on, excited by the moving &s;ugge&s;tions of humanity; and awed with the ju&s;t demands of natural liberty, equity, equal|ity, &amp; principles of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation originally drew up the &s;cheme, and then obtained the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l approbation.

I Shall di&s;clo&s;e &s;everal principles of natural know|ledge; plainly di&s;covering the law of nature; or the true &s;entiments of natural rea&s;on, with re&s;pect to mans being and government.

<ITEM>1. Of the natural (in di&s;tinction to the civil) and then,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Of the civil being of man. And I &s;hall principally take baron <HI>Puffendorff</HI> for my chief guide and &s;poke&s;-man.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. I &s;hall con&s;ider man in a &s;tate of natural being, as a free-born &s;ubject under the crown of heaven, and owing homage to none but God him&s;elf. It is certain civil go|vernment in general, is a very admirable re&s;ult of provi|dence, and an incomparable benefit to mankind, yet mu&s;t needs be acknowledged to be the effect of human free-com|pacts and not of divine in&s;titution; it is the produce of mans rea&s;on, of human and rational combinations, and not from any direct orders of infinite wi&s;dom, in any po&s;i|tive law wherein is drawn up this or that &s;cheme of civil government. Government (&s;ays the Lord <HI>Warrington</HI>) is nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;in that no &s;ociety of men can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it; and that particular form of government is nece&s;&s;ary which be&s;t &s;uits the temper and inclination of a people. No|thing can be God's ordinance, but what he has particularly declared to be &s;uch; there is no particular form of civil government de&s;cribed in God's word, neither does nature prompt it. The government of the Jews was changed five times. Government is not formed by nature, as other births or productions; if it were, it would be the &s;ame in all countries; becau&s;e nature keeps the &s;ame method, in the &s;ame thing, in all climates. If a common-wealth be changed into a monarchy, is it nature that forms, and brings forth the monarch? Or if a royal family be wholly extinct (as in <HI>Noah</HI>'s ca&s;e, being not heir apparent from de&s;cent from Adam) is it nature that mu&s;t go to work (with the kings bees, who them&s;elves alone pre&s;erve the royal race in that empire) to breed a monarch before the people can have a king, or a government &s;ent over them? And thus we mu&s;t leave kings to re&s;olve which is their be&s;t title to their crowns, whether natural right, or the con&s;titution of government &s;ettled by human compacts,

under the direction and conduct of rea&s;on. But to pro|ceed under the head of a &s;tate of natural being, I &s;hall more di&s;tinctly explain the &s;tate of human nature in its original capacity, as man is placed on earth by his maker, and cloathed with many inve&s;titures, and immunities which properly belong to man &s;eparately con&s;idered. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. The prime immunity in mans &s;tate, is that he is mo&s;t properly the &s;ubject of the law of nature. He is the fa|vorite animal on earth; in that this part of God's image, <HI>viz.</HI> rea&s;on is congenate with his nature, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in by a law immutable, in&s;tampt upon his frame, God has provided a rule for men in all their actions, obliging each one to the performance of that which is right, not only as to ju&s;tice, but likewi&s;e as to all other moral virtues, the which is no|thing but the dictate of right rea&s;on founded in the &s;oul of man. <HI>Molloy, De Mao, Praef.</HI> That which is to be drawn from mans rea&s;on, flowing from the true current of that faculty, when unperverted, may be &s;aid to be the law of nature, on which account, the holy &s;criptures declare it written on mens hearts. For being endowed with a &s;oul, you may know from your&s;elf, how and what you ought to act. Rom. 2.14. <HI>The&s;e having not a law, are a law to them&s;elves.</HI> So that the meaning is, when we ac|knowledge the law of nature to be the dictate of right rea&s;on, we mu&s;t mean that the under&s;tanding of man is en|dowed with &s;uch a power, as to be able, from the con|templation of human condition to di&s;cover a nece&s;&s;ity of living agreably with this law: And likewi&s;e to find out &s;ome principle, by which the precepts of it, may be clear|ly and &s;olidly demon&s;trated. The way to di&s;cover the law of nature in our own &s;tate, is by a narrow watch, and ac|curate contemplation of our natural condition, and propen|&s;ions. Others &s;ay this is the way to find out the law of nature. <HI>&s;cil.</HI> If a man any ways doubts, whether what he is going to do to another man be agreable to the law of nature, then let him &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf to be in that other mans room; and by this rule effectually executed, a man mu&s;t be a very dull &s;cholar to nature not to make pro|ficiency in the knowledge of her laws. But more particu|larly in pur&s;uing our condition for the di&s;covery of the law of nature, this is very obvious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> view&punc; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="24" REF="012626_0023_0F8B8F1A5CF596E8">1. A principle of &s;elf love, and &s;elf pre&s;ervation, is very predominant in every mans being.</P>
<P N="2">2. A &s;ociable di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P N="3">3. An affection or love to mankind in general. And to give &s;uch &s;entiments the force of a law, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e a God who takes care of all mankind, and has thus obliged each one, as a &s;ubject of higher principles of being, than meer in&s;tincts. For that all law properly con&s;idered, &s;up|po&s;es a capable &s;ubject, and a &s;uperiour power, and the law of God which is binding, is publi&s;hed by the dictates of right re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as other ways: Therefore &s;ays <HI>Plutarch,</HI> to follow God and obey rea&s;on is the &s;ame thing. But moreover that God has e&s;tabli&s;hed the law of nature, as the general rule of government, is further illu&s;trable from the man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;anctions in providence, and from the peace and guilt of con&s;cience in them that either obey, or violate the law of nature. But moreover, the foundation of the law of nature with relation to government, may be thus di&s;covered. <HI>&s;cil.</HI> Man is a creature extreamly de&s;irous of his own pre&s;ervation; of him&s;elf he is plainly expo&s;ed to many wants, unable to &s;ecure his own &s;afety and mainte|nance, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his fellows; &amp; he is al&s;o able of returning kindne&s;s by the furtherance of mutual good; but yet man is often found to be malicious, in&s;olent, and ea&s;ily provoked, and as powerful in effecting mi&s;chief, as he is ready in de&s;igning it. Now that &s;uch a creature may be pre&s;erved, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he be &s;ociable; that is, that he be capable and di&s;po&s;ed to unite him&s;elf to tho&s;e of his own &s;pecies, and to regulate him&s;elf towards them, that they may have no fair rea&s;on to do him harm; but rather incline to promote his intere&s;ts, and &s;ecure his rights and concerns. This then is a fundamental law of nature, that every man as far as in him lies, do maintain a &s;ociablene&s;s with others, agreable with the main end and di&s;po&s;ition of human nature in general. For this is very apparent, that rea&s;on and &s;ociety render man the mo&s;t potent of all crea|tures. And finally, from the principles of &s;ociablene&s;s it follows as a fundamental law of nature, that man is not &s;o wedded to his own intere&s;t, but that he can make the com|mon good the mark of his aim: and hence he becomes capacitated to enter into a civil &s;tate by the law of nature; for without this property in nature, viz. Sociablene&s;s,
<PB N="25" REF="012626_0024_0F8B8F1B0B3F3DF0">
which is for cementing of parts, every government would &s;oon moulder and di&s;&s;olve.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd great immunity of man is an original liberty in&s;tampt upon his rational nature. He that intrudes upon this liberty, violates the law of nature. In this di&s;|cour&s;e I &s;hall wave the con&s;ideration of mans moral turpi|tude, but &s;hall view him phy&s;ically as a creature which God has made and furni&s;hed e&s;&s;entially with many enobl|ing immunities, which render him the mo&s;t augu&s;t animal in the world, and &s;till, whatever has happened &s;ince his creation, he remains at the upper-end of nature, and as &s;uch is a creature of a very noble character. For as to his dominion, the whole frame of the lower part of the uni|ver&s;e is devoted to his u&s;e, and at his command, and his liberty under the conduct of right rea&s;on, is equal with his tru&s;t. Which liberty may be briefly con&s;idered, in|ternally as to his mind, and externally as to his per&s;on.</P>
<P N="1">1. The native internal liberty of man's nature implies, a faculty of doing or omitting things according to the direc|tion of his judgment. But in a more &s;pecial meaning, this liberty does not con&s;i&s;t in a loo&s;e and ungovernable free|dom, or in an unbounded licence of acting. Such licence is di&s;agreeing with the condition and dignity of man, and would make man of a lower and meaner con&s;titution than brute creatures; who in all their liberties are kept under a better and a more rational government, by their in&s;tincts. Therefore as <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;ays, Tho&s;e per&s;ons only who live in obedience to rea&s;on, are worthy to be accounted free: They alone live as they will, who have learnt what they ought to will. So that the true natural liberty of man, &s;uch as really and truely agrees to him, mu&s;t be under&s;tood, as he is guided and re&s;trained by the tyes of rea&s;on, and laws of nature; all the re&s;t is brutal, if not wor&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mans external per&s;onal, natural liberty, antecedent to all human parts, or alliances mu&s;t al&s;o be con&s;idered. And &s;o every man mu&s;t be conceived to be perfectly in his own power and di&s;po&s;al, and not ro be controuled by the authority of any other. And thus every man, mu&s;t be acknowledged equal to every man, &s;ince all &s;ubjection and all command are equally bani&s;hed on both &s;ides; and con|&s;idering all men thus at liberty, every m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, has a prero|gative
<PB N="26" REF="012626_0025_0F8B8F1ECB49F808">
to judge for him&s;elf, viz. What &s;hall be mo&s;t for his behoof, happine&s;s and well-being.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third capital immunity belonging to mans na|ture, is an equality among&s;t men; which is not to be de|nied by the law of nature, till man has re&s;igned him&s;elf with all his rights for the &s;ake of a civil &s;tate; and then his per&s;onal liberty and equality is to be cheri&s;hed, and pre&s;erved to the highe&s;t degree, as will con&s;i&s;t with all ju&s;t di&s;tinctions among&s;t men of honor, and &s;hall be agrea|ble with the public good. For man has a high valuation of him&s;elf, and the pa&s;&s;ion &s;eems to lay its fir&s;t foundation (not in pride, but) really in the high and admirable frame and con&s;titution of human nature. The word man &s;ays my author, is thought to carry &s;omewhat of dignity in its &s;ound; and we commonly make u&s;e of this as the mo&s;t proper and prevailing arguments again&s;t a rude in&s;ulter, <HI>viz. I am not a bea&s;t or a dog: But am a man as well as your&s;elf.</HI> Since then human nature agrees equally with all per&s;ons; and &s;ince no one can live a &s;ociable life with another that does not own or re&s;pect him as a man; it follows as a command of the law of nature, that every man e&s;teem and treat another as one who is naturally his equal, or who is a man as well as he. There be many popular, or plau&s;ible rea&s;ons that greatly illu&s;trate this equality, viz. that we all derive our being from one &s;tock, the &s;ame common father of human race.

<PB N="27" REF="012626_0026_0F8B8F210D0AC2A8">
we all owe our exi&s;tence to the &s;ame method of propaga|tion. The noble&s;t mortal in his entrance on the &s;tage of life, is not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any pomp or of pa&s;&s;age from the lowe&s;t of mankind; and our life ha&s;tens to the &s;ame general mark: Death ob&s;erves no ceremony, but knocks as loud at the barriers of the court, as at the door of the cottage. This equality being admitted, bears a very great force in maintaining peace and friend&s;hip among&s;t men. For that he who would u&s;e the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others, in pro|moting his own advantage, ought as freely to be at their &s;ervice when they want his help on the like occa&s;ions. One good turn requires another, is the common proverb; for otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t need e&s;teem others unequal to him&s;elf, who con&s;tantly demands their aid, and as con&s;tantly denies his own. And whoever is of this in&s;olent temper, cannot but highly di&s;plea&s;e tho&s;e about him, and &s;oon give occa|&s;ion of the breach of the common peace. It was a man|ly reproof which <HI>Charactacus</HI> gave the <HI>Romans. Num Si vos Omnibus,</HI> &amp;c. What! becau&s;e you de&s;ire to be ma&s;ters of all men, does it follow therefore that all men &s;hould de&s;ire to be your &s;laves, for that it is a command of na|tures law, that no man that has not obtained a particular and &s;pecial right, &s;hall arrogate to him&s;elf a larger &s;hare than his fellows, but &s;hall admit others to equal privileges with him&s;elf. So that the principle of equality in a na|tural &s;tate, is peculiarly tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed by pride, which is when a man without &s;ufficient rea&s;on, prefers, him&s;elf to others. And though as <HI>Hen&s;ius,</HI> paraphra&s;es upon <HI>Ari&s;totle's</HI> politicks to this purpo&s;e. viz. Nothing is more &s;uitable to nature, than that tho&s;e who excel in under&s;tanding and prudence, &s;hould rule and controul tho&s;e who are le&s;s hap|py in tho&s;e advantages, &amp;c. Yet we mu&s;t note, that there is room for an an&s;wer, <HI>&s;cil.</HI> That it would be the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity to believe, that nature actually inve&s;ts the wi&s;e with a &s;overeignity over the weak; or with a right of forcing them again&s;t their wills; for that no &s;overeignity can be e&s;tabli&s;hed, unle&s;s &s;ome human deed, or cove|nant precede: Nor does natural fitne&s;s for govern|ment make a man pre&s;ently governor over another; for that as <HI>Ulpian</HI> &s;ays, <HI>by a natural right all men are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> free;</HI> and nature having &s;et all men upon a level and made them equals, no &s;ervitude or &s;ubjection can be conceived

without inequality; and this cannot be made without u&s;ur|pation or force in others, or voluntary compliance in tho&s;e who re&s;ign their freedom, and give away their degree of natural being. And thus we come,</P>
<P N="2">2. To con&s;ider man in a civil &s;tate of being; wherein we &s;hall ob&s;erve the great difference between a natural, and political &s;tate; for in the latter &s;tate many great di&s;propor|tions appear, or at lea&s;t many obvious di&s;tinctions are &s;oon made among&s;t men; which doctrine is to be laid open un|der a few heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. Every man con&s;idered in a natural &s;tate, mu&s;t be al|lowed to be free, and at his own di&s;po&s;e; yet to &s;uit mans inclinations to &s;ociety; and in a peculiar manner to gratify the nece&s;&s;ity he is in of public rule and order, he is impel|led to enter into a civil community; and dive&s;ts him&s;elf of his natural freedom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd puts him&s;elf under government; which among&s;t other th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gs comprehends the power of life and death over him, together with authority to enjoin him &s;ome things to which he has an utter aver&s;ion, and to pro|hibit him other things, for which he may have as &s;trong an inclination; &s;o that he may be often under this authori|ty, obliged to &s;acrifice his private, for the public good. So that though man is inclined to &s;ociety, yet he is driven to a combination by great nece&s;&s;ity. For that the true and leading cau&s;e of forming governments, and yielding up natural liberty, and throwing mans equality into a com|mon pile to be new ca&s;t by the rules of fellow&s;hip; was really and truly to guard them&s;elves again&s;t the injuries men were liable to interchangeably; for none &s;o good to man, as man, and yet none a greater enemy. So that,</P>
<P N="2">2. The fir&s;t human &s;ubject and original of civil power is the people. For as they have a power every man over him&s;elf in a natural &s;tate, &s;o upon a combination they can and do bequeath this power unto others; and &s;ettle it according as their united di&s;cretion &s;hall determine. For that this is very plain that when the &s;ubject of &s;overeign power is quite extinct, that power returns to the people again. And when they are free, they may &s;et up what &s;pecies of government they plea&s;e; or if they rather incline to it, they may &s;ub&s;ide into a &s;tate of natural be|ing, if it be plainly for the be&s;t. In the Ea&s;tern country of the <HI>Magul,</HI> we have &s;ome re&s;emblance of the ca&s;e; for
<PB N="29" REF="012626_0028_0F8B8F22911D4578">
upon the death of an ab&s;olute monarch, they live &s;o many days without a civil head; but in that <HI>Interregnum,</HI> tho&s;e who &s;urvive the vacancy, are glad to get into a civil &s;tate again; and u&s;ually they are in a very bloody condition when they return under the covert of a new monarch; this project is to indear the people to a tyranny, from the experience they have &s;o lately had of an anarchy.</P>
<P N="3">3. The formal rea&s;on of government is the will of a community, yielded up and &s;urrendered to &s;ome other &s;ubject, either of one particular per&s;on, or more, conveyed in the following manner.</P>
<P>Let us conceive in our mind a multitude of men, all na|turally free and equal; going about voluntarily, to erect them&s;elves into a new common-wealth. Now their con|dition being &s;uch, to bring them&s;elves into a politick body, they mu&s;t needs enter into divers covenants.</P>
<P N="1">1. They mu&s;t interchangeably each man covenant to join in one la&s;ting &s;ociety, that they may be capable to concert the mea&s;ures of their &s;afety, by a public vote.</P>
<P N="2">2. A vote or decree mu&s;t then nextly pa&s;s to &s;et up &s;ome particular &s;pecies of government over them. And if they are joined in their fir&s;t compact upon ab&s;olute terms to &s;tand to the deci&s;ion of the fir&s;t vote concerning the &s;pecies of government: Then all are bound by the majority to acquie&s;ce in that particular form thereby &s;ettled, though their own private opinion, incline them to &s;ome other model.</P>
<P N="3">3. After a decree has &s;pecified the particular form of government, then there will be need of a new covenant, whereby tho&s;e on whom &s;overeignity is conferred, engage to take care of the common peace, and welfare.

<P N="1">1. A democracy; which is when the &s;overeign power is lodged in a council con&s;i&s;ting of all the members, and where every member has the privilege of a vote. This form of government, appears in the greate&s;t part of the world to have been the mo&s;t ancient. For that rea&s;on &s;eems to &s;hew it to be mo&s;t probable, That when men (being originally in a condition of natural freedom and equality) had thoughts of joining in a civil body, would without que&s;tion be inclined to admini&s;ter their common affairs, by their common judgment, and &s;o mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily to gratify that inclination e&s;tabli&s;h a democracy; neither can it be rationally imagined, that fathers of families be|ing yet free and independent, &s;hould in a moment, or little time take of their long delight in governing their own affairs, and devolve all upon &s;ome &s;ingle &s;overeign com|mander; for that it &s;eems to have been thought more equitable, that what belonged to all &s;hould be managed by all, when all had entered by compact into one com|munity. The original of our government, &s;ays <HI>Plato,</HI> (&s;peaking of the <HI>Athenian</HI> common-wealth) was taken from the equality of our race. Other &s;tates there are compo&s;ed of different blood, and of unequal lines, the con&s;equence of which are di&s;proportionable &s;overeignity, tyranical or oligarchycal &s;way; under which men live in &s;uch a man|ner, as to e&s;teem them&s;elves partly lords, and partly &s;laves to each other. But we and our countrymen, being all born brethren of the &s;ame mother, do not look upon our|&s;elves to &s;tand under &s;o hard a relation, as that of lords and &s;laves; but the parity of our de&s;cent incline us to keep up the like parity by our laws, and to yield the precedency to nothing but to &s;uperior virtue and wi&s;dom. And more|over it &s;eems to very manife&s;t that mo&s;t civil communities aro&s;e at fir&s;t from the union of families, that were nearly allied in race and blood.

<P N="3">3. The third &s;pecies of a regular government, is a monarchy, which is &s;ettled when the &s;overeign power is conferred on &s;ome one worthy per&s;on.

<P N="2">2. Mixt governments, which are various and of divers kinds (not now to be enumerated) yet po&s;&s;ibly the faire&s;t in the world is that which has a regular monarchy; &s;ettled upon a noble democracy as its ba&s;is.

It is &s;uch a monarchy, as by mo&s;t admirable temperament affords very much to the indu&s;try, liberty, and happine&s;s of the &s;ubject, and re&s;erves enough for the maje&s;ty and prerogative of any king, who will own his people as &s;ubjects, not as &s;laves, It is a kingdom, that of all the kingdoms of the world, is mo&s;t like to the kingdom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who&s;e yoke is ea&s;y, and burden light.

<P N="2">2. I &s;hall now make &s;ome improvement of the forego|ing
<PB N="34" REF="012626_0033_0F8B8F2BB4951328">
principles of civil knowledge, fairly deduced from the law of nature. And I &s;hall peculiarly refer to eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal affairs, whereby we may in probability di&s;cover more clearly the kind, and &s;omething of the nature of that go|vernment, which Chri&s;t has placed in and over his church. The learned debates of men, and divine writ &s;ometimes &s;eems to ca&s;t &s;uch a grandeur on the church and its officers, as though they &s;tood in peerage with civil empire. Rev. 1.6, 9. 1 Pet. 2.9. 1 Cor. 4.8. 1 Cor. 12.28. 2 Cor. 10.8. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t all &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions mu&s;t needs be other|ways interpreted. God is the highe&s;t cau&s;e that acts by council; and it mu&s;t needs be altogether repugnant, to think he &s;hould fore-ca&s;t the &s;tate of this world by no bet|ter a &s;cheme, than to order two &s;overeign powers, in the &s;ame grand community, which would be like placing two &s;uns in the firmament, which would be to &s;et the univer&s;e into a flame : That &s;hould &s;uch an error happen, one mu&s;t needs be forthwith extingui&s;hed, to bring the frame of nature into a ju&s;t temper and keep it out of harms way. But to proceed with my purpo&s;e I &s;hall go back upon the civil &s;cheme, and inquire after two things: Fir&s;t of rebel|lion again&s;t government in general, and then in &s;pecial; whether any of the afore&s;aid &s;pecies of regular govern|ment can be predictable of the church of God on earth.</P>
<P N="1">1. In general, concerning rebellion again&s;t government, for particular &s;ubjects to break in upon regular communites duly e&s;tabli&s;hed, is from the premi&s;es to violate the law of nature; and is a high u&s;urpation upon the fir&s;t grand im|munities of mankind. Such rebels in &s;tates, and u&s;urpers in churches affront the world, with a pre&s;umption that the be&s;t of the brotherhood are a company of fools, and that them&s;elves have fairly monopolized all the rea&s;on of hu|man nature. Yea, they take upon them the boldne&s;s to a&s;&s;ume a prerogative of trampling under foot the natural original equality and liberty of their fellows; for to pu&s;h the proprietors of &s;ettlements out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their old, and impo&s;e new &s;chemes upon them, is vertually to declare them in a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage, or that they were born &s;o; and therefore will the u&s;urper be &s;o gracious as to in&s;ure them they &s;hall not be &s;old at the next market: they mu&s;t e&s;teem it a favor, for by this time all the original prerogatives of mans nature are intentionally a victim,
<PB N="35" REF="012626_0034_0F8B8F2C88A48E10">
&s;moaking to &s;atiate the u&s;urpers ambition. It is a very tart ob&s;ervation on an Engli&s;h monarch, and where it may by proportion be applied to a &s;ubject mu&s;t needs &s;ink very deep, and &s;erve for evidence under this head. It is in the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of K. <HI>C.</HI> 2. and K. <HI>J.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 2. &s;ays my author, Where the con&s;titution of a nation is &s;uch, that the laws of the land are the mea&s;ures both of the &s;overeigns commands, and the obedience of the &s;ubjects, whereby it is provided; that as the one are not to invade what by conce&s;&s;ions and &s;tipulations is granted to the ruler; &s;o the other is not to deprive them of their lawful and de|termined rights and liberties; then the prince who &s;trives to &s;ubvert the fundamental laws of the &s;ociety, is the trai|tor and the rebel, and not the people, who endeavor to pre&s;erve and defend their own. It's very applicable to particular men in their rebellions or u&s;urpations in church or &s;tate.</P>
<P N="2">2. In &s;pecial I &s;hall now proceed to enquire, whether any of the afore&s;aid &s;pecies of regular, unmixt governments, can with any good &s;hew of rea&s;on be predictable of the church of Chri&s;t on earth. If the churches of Chri&s;t, as churches, are either the object or &s;ubject of a &s;overeign power intru&s;ted in the hands of men, then mo&s;t certainly one of the fore-cited &s;chemes of a perfect government will be applicable to it.</P>
<P>Before I pur&s;ue the enquiry, it may not be improper to pau&s;e, and make &s;ome caution here, by di&s;tingui&s;hing between that which may have &s;ome re&s;emblance of civil power, and the thing it&s;elf; and &s;o the power of churches is but a faint re&s;emblance of civil power; it comes in re|ality nothing near to the thing it&s;elf; for the one is truly coercive, the other per&s;ua&s;ive; the one is &s;overeign power, the other is delegated and mini&s;terial: but not to delay, I &s;hall proceed with my enquiry, and therein &s;hall endeavor to humor the &s;everal great claimers of government in the church of Chri&s;t. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;hall begin with a monarchy. It's certain, his holine&s;s, either by rea&s;onable pleas, or powerful cheats, has a&s;&s;umed an ab&s;olute and univer&s;al &s;overeignity; this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ills his cathedral chair, and is adorned with a triple crown, and in defence thereof does prote&s;t, The Almighty has made him both key-keeper of heaven and hell, with

the adjacent territories of purgatory, and ve&s;ted in him an ab&s;olute &s;overeignity over the chri&s;tian world. And his right has &s;o far prevailed, that princes and civil monarchs hold their crowns and donations as his dutiful &s;ons, and loyal &s;ubjects, he therefore decks him&s;elf with the &s;poils of the divine attributes, &s;tiling him&s;elf, our Lord God, <HI>optimum, maximum et &s;upremum numen in Terris</HI>; a God on earth, a vi&s;ible deity, and that his power is ab&s;olute, and his wi&s;dom infallible. And many of the great potentates of the earth have paid their fealty, as though it was really &s;o. One of them clad in canvas, going bare-foot in the depth of winter, (in obedience to the decree, &s;tinting the pennance in proportion to the wickedne&s;s of princes) has waited many days for ab&s;olution at his pious ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. Another has thrown him&s;elf down pro&s;trate a humble peni|tent before him : He has placed his holy foot on the mo|narchs profane neck as cru&s;hing a vermine, crawling out of the &s;table of his &s;overeignty; and others frequently ki&s;s his toes with very profound devotion. The&s;e and &s;uch like triumphant &s;ignals of his &s;overeign power does he wear. And indeed if he is the univer&s;al monarch of the catholic church, princes that are members of it mu&s;t needs knock under; for that in one world there cannot po&s;&s;ibly be two <HI>Mo&s;t High</HI>'s, any more than two <HI>Infinites.</HI> Thus you &s;ee the clergy, or go&s;pel mini&s;try of the chri&s;tian world have &s;o wi&s;ely handled bu&s;ine&s;s, and managed the go&s;pel, that they have fairly (as they avouch) found a &s;overeign power bequeathed in it to the mini&s;try of Chri&s;t, and romaging more warily and nicely, at la&s;t found a &s;piritual monarch, very compleatly furni&s;hed with the keys of all &s;orts of power hanging at his girdle; and may we not pronounce the wi&s;er they! &s;eeing the world growing weary of religi|on, was willing to loll it&s;elf down to &s;leep, and leave them in &s;ole tru&s;t with the whole intere&s;t of God's kingdom. But the &s;ad enquiry is, whether this &s;ort of government has not plainly &s;ubverted the de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, and the end for which Chri&s;t's government was ordained, viz. the moral, &s;piritual, and eternal happine&s;s of men?</P>
<P>But I have no occa&s;ion to pur&s;ue this remark with tedi|ous demon&s;trations: It's very plain, it's written with blood in capital letters, to be read at midnight by the flames of <HI>Smithfield,</HI> and other &s;uch like con&s;ecrated fires.

That the government of this eccle&s;ia&s;tical monarch has in|&s;tead of &s;anctifying, ab&s;olutely debauched the world, and &s;ubverted all good chri&s;tianity in it.

<P>It is very plain (allowing me to &s;peak emblematically) the primitive con&s;titution of the churches was a democracy as appears by the foregoing parallel.

<P>The right of the people did not remain unhurt through many ages; neither could it well be otherways, but that it mu&s;t be lo&s;t, or much dimini&s;hed. <HI>Zonaras</HI> does confe&s;s that heretofore bi&s;hops were cho&s;en by the &s;uffrage of the people. But many &s;editions happening among them; it was decreed that every bi&s;hop &s;hould hereafter be cho&s;en by the authority of the bi&s;hops of every province. The cau&s;e &s;eemed to be &s;o very &s;pecious, that nothing could be more decent, or more conducive to the &s;afety of the com|mon wealth.</P>
<P>Yet (&s;ays my author) if you do well weigh the bu&s;ine&s;s, you mu&s;t needs acknowledge nothing could have happened more pernicious or de&s;tructive to the church of God. For &s;oon after the&s;e things came to pa&s;s, it is very obvious, that tyranny over the con&s;ciences of the faithful; and an intolerable pride every where grew rampant among the guides of the church. Yet there was one thing &s;till very needful to be done; and that was to e&s;tabli&s;h or confirm the power which the metropolitans, and bi&s;hops had ac|quired to them&s;elves. Therefore they fell to it tooth and nail to drive away the fraternity from all intere&s;t in electi|ons: And alas poor hearts! They began to &s;leep with both ears; that then was &s;carce any enemy left to inter|rupt, or controul the conquerors.

Al&s;o the natural equality of men among&s;t men mu&s;t be duly favored; in that government was never e&s;tabli&s;hed by God or nature, to give one man a preroga|tive to in&s;ult over another; therefore in a civil, as well as in a natural &s;tate of being, a ju&s;t equality is to be indulged &s;o far, as that every man is bound to honor every man, which is agreable both with nature and religion, 1 Pet. 2.17. <HI>Honor all men.</HI> The end of all good government is to cultivate humanity, and promote the happine&s;s of all, and the good of every man in all his rights, his life, liberty, e&s;tate, honor, &amp;c. without injury or abu&s;e done to any. Then certainly it cannot ea&s;ily be thought, that a company of men, that &s;hall enter into a voluntary compact, to hold all power in their own hands, thereby to u&s;e and improve their united force, wi&s;dom, riches and &s;trength for the common and particular good of every member, as is the nature of a democracy; I &s;ay it cannot be that this &s;ort of con&s;titution, will &s;o readily furni&s;h tho&s;e in government with an appetite, or di&s;po&s;ition to prey upon each other, or embezle the common &s;tock; as &s;ome particular per&s;ons may be apt to do when &s;et off, and intru&s;ted with the &s;ame power. And moreover this appears very natural, that when the afore&s;aid government or power, &s;ettled in all, when they have elected certain capable per&s;ons to mini&s;ter in their affairs, and the &s;aid mini&s;ters remain accountable to the a&s;&s;embly; the&s;e officers mu&s;t needs be under the influence of many wi&s;e cautions from their own thoughts (as well as under confinement by their commi&s;&s;ion) in their whole admini&s;tration: And from thence it mu&s;t needs follow that they will be more apt, and inclined to &s;teer right for the main point, viz. The peculiar good, and benefit of the whole, and every particular member fairly and &s;incerely. And why may not the&s;e &s;tand for very rational pleas in church order?</P>
<P>For certainly if Chri&s;t has &s;ettled any form of power in his church he has done it for his churches &s;afety, and for the benefit of every member: Then he mu&s;t needs be pre|&s;umed to have made choice of that government as &s;hould lea&s;t expo&s;e his people to hazard, either from the fraud,

or arbitrary mea&s;ures of particular men. And it is as plain as day light, there is no &s;pecies of government like a democracy to attain this end. There is but about two &s;teps from an ari&s;tocracy to a monarchy, and from thence but one to a tyranny; an able &s;tanding force, and an ill nature, <HI>Ip&s;o facto,</HI> turns an ab&s;olute monarch into a tyrant; this is obvious among the Roman <HI>Cae&s;ars,</HI> and through the world. And all the&s;e direful tran&s;mutations are ea&s;ier in church affairs (from the different qualities of things) than in civil &s;tates. For what is it that cunning and learned men can't make the world &s;wallow as an article of their creed, if they are once inve&s;ted with an uncontroulable power, and are to be the &s;tanding orators to mankind in matters of faith and obedience? indeed &s;ome very wi&s;e and learned men are plea&s;ed to inveigh, and reproach the notion of a democracy in the church, which makes the <HI>Cetu fidelium</HI> or community of the faithful the fir&s;t &s;ubject of the power of government.

<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. An ab&s;olute or limited monarch can't manage the power or government devolved upon him, without the great officers of the crown, or a large &s;et of mini&s;ters; though po&s;&s;ibly he may with quicker di&s;patch i&s;&s;ue out his decrees, yet he mu&s;t execute all by his mini&s;try.

<P N="3">3. Infer, That if the&s;e churches are not properly formed, yet are fairly e&s;tabli&s;hed in their pre&s;ent order by the law of nature. And will they be advi&s;ed, I would exhort them to try who will be &s;o bold as to dare to di&s;&s;eize them. A monarchy has been tried in the church with a witne&s;s, but it has ab&s;olutely failed us. An ari&s;tocracy in a deep calm threw the democracy overboard, and took not only the helm in hand, but &s;eized &s;hip and cargo as their right and title; but after &s;ome time brought all to &s;hip-wreck, and that in a good harbour too.</P>
<P>A democracy was the noble government which beat out in all the bad weather of ten bloody per&s;ecutions under the management of antiquity. And this is our con&s;titution, and what can't we be plea&s;ed? This con&s;titution is as a|greable with the light and laws of nature as any other what&s;oever, as has been fairly laid down and fully evinced, and more accommodated to the concerns of religion than any other. Therefore I &s;hall now conclude my demon&s;tra|tion with this brief appeal to the common rea&s;on of man|kind, viz.</P>
<P>How can it con&s;i&s;t with the honorable terms man holds upon here on earth; that the be&s;t &s;ort of men that we can find in the world; &s;uch men as are adorned with a double &s;ett of enobling immunities, the fir&s;t from nature, the other from grace; that the&s;e men when they enter into charter-party to man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge a trade for heaven, mu&s;t <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> be clapt under a government, that is arbitrary and di&s;po|tic; yea that carries the plain &s;ymptoms of a tyranny in it, when the light of nature knows of a better &s;pecies, and frequently has made u&s;e of it? It wants no farther demon|&s;tration, for its mo&s;t apparent, that nature is &s;o much mi&s;|tre&s;s of her&s;elf, that man in a natural &s;tate of being, is un|der God the fir&s;t &s;ubject of all power, and therefore can make his own choice, and by deliberate compacts, &s;ettles his own conditions for the government of him&s;elf in a civil &s;tate of being: And when a government &s;o &s;ettled &s;hall throw it&s;elf from its foundations, or the &s;ubjects of &s;ove|reign power &s;hall &s;ubvert or confound the con&s;titution, they
<PB N="43" REF="012626_0042_0F8B8F374A8BEF98">
then degrade them&s;elves; and &s;o all power returns again to the people, who are the fir&s;t owners. And what! Is man become &s;o unfortunate, degraded and deba&s;ed, as to be without all power in &s;ettling a government over him&s;elf, relating to the matters of his eternal well-being? Or when he comes back to a fathers hou&s;e, mu&s;t he fall into the capacity, of a meer pa&s;&s;ive being, and be put under &s;uch tutors, as can ea&s;ily turn tyrants over him, and no relief left for him in his own hands; this is certainly mo&s;t re|pugnant to the light of nature, and very di&s;agreable with the liberty and free genius of a go&s;pel &s;tate. Nay, in a word, if the government of the churches be &s;ettled by God, either in the hands of a church monarch, or ari&s;to|cracy, and the people are no ways the &s;ubject of church power: Nay, if they are not under Chri&s;t, the fountain of power; then the reformation &s;o called, is but a meer cheat, a &s;chi&s;m, and notorious rebellion; neither is there room left for the lea&s;t paliation, or &s;hadow of excu&s;e, for the reformers in renouncing their obedience to their pub|lic governors. And the Martyrologies which pretend to immortalize the fame of eminent heroes, mu&s;t be changed into chronicles, handing along an account of the ju&s;t and de&s;erved fate of a crew of rebels again&s;t God and govern|ment; for what bu&s;ine&s;s had &s;uch a company of illiterate and crack brain'd fellows to meddle with their rulers, or examine into their admini&s;trations? for if they have no right of power in government, they &s;tand ab&s;olutely bound to yield a pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance; and if they are &s;o hardy and daring as to oppo&s;e their lawful rulers, the &s;harpe&s;t penalty in this world, is two ea&s;y for them; the inqui&s;ition is but dallying and playing with them, hell is their de&s;ert. But how it comes about that a &s;tate of grace, when in want of a &s;uitable government, is become &s;uch a va&s;&s;al, and wi&s;e and cunning nature is by her crea|tor intru&s;ted, and adorned with more enobling preroga|tives, I mu&s;t leave, and re&s;ign unto tho&s;e learned men to &s;olve, who plead for an ari&s;tocracy in the churches of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But to wind up the whole di&s;cour&s;e in a few words, I acknowledge many objections may be here made, and &s;e|veral que&s;tions of moment might here fall under debate; but having obtained what I have principally &s;ought for, in traver&s;ing the paths of nature, in the three following par|ticulars; therefore with them, and with one objection an|&s;wered;
<PB N="44" REF="012626_0043_0F8B8F379C334CA0">
and al&s;o with &s;ome brief improvement of the grand hypothe&s;is in this demon&s;tration, I &s;hall fini&s;h the argument.</P>
<P N="1">1. Three particulars; or &s;o many golden maxims, &s;e|curing the honor of congregational churches.</P>
<P>Particular 1. That the people or fraternity under the go&s;pel, are the fir&s;t &s;ubject of power; or el&s;e religion &s;inks the dignity of human nature into a ba&s;er capacity with relation to eccle&s;ia&s;tical, than it is in, in a natural &s;tate of being with relation to civil government.</P>
<P>Particular 2. That a democracy in church or &s;tate, is a very honorable and regular government according to the dictates of right rea&s;on. And therefore,</P>
<P>Particular 3. That the&s;e churches of New-England, in their ancient con&s;titution of church order; it being a democracy, are manife&s;tly ju&s;tified and defended by the law and light of nature.</P>
<P N="2">2. The objection. The plea from the law of nature for a democracy in the church, is as forceable for any other &s;pecies of government; becau&s;e nature is furni&s;hed with &s;uch a variety of &s;chemes as has been pleaded to: And why may not the wi&s;e chri&s;tian nations take which likes them be&s;t?</P>
<P>An&s;w. We mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between man left &s;olely to the direction of the law of nature, and as the &s;ubject of revelation, wherein divine wi&s;dom may interpo&s;e; and determine on &s;ome particular &s;pecies, without hurting or cro&s;&s;ing the law of nature, Therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. I readily grant and acknowledge, a chri&s;tian people may &s;ettle what &s;pecies of government they plea&s;e, when they are &s;olely left to determine by the law of nature, what government in the church they will have. But then we mu&s;t remember, that by the argument or conce&s;&s;ion, the power is originally in the people; and then our own ca&s;e is &s;ecure and &s;afe enough; both on the account of the re|ver&s;ion of power, and e&s;pecially, for that the people the fir&s;t &s;ubjects of power, have been plea&s;ed to &s;ettle a de|mocracy for their government, in the churches of this country. And if after the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of about an hundred years, any per&s;ons can per&s;wade them to alter their government into any other &s;pecies, this will be le&s;s worthy of blame, than craftily, or unfairly to force it out of their hands.</P>
<P N="2">2. It's granted, that according to the light of nature,
<PB N="45" REF="012626_0044_0F8B8F384AD58F40">
there be various regular models of government; but if di|vine wi&s;dom is plea&s;ed to interpo&s;e and over-rule natures agitations, and ca&s;t the &s;cales for this or that particular form, nature will be but fair mannered to &s;ubmit to its author and rector. So that if we find that God has di&s;clo&s;ed his mind by revelation, that his churches be the &s;ubjects of a democracy, then all &s;tand obliged to comply under a double bond. And &s;o we come under a proper cri&s;is to enquire in the next place for &s;cripture-evidence in the ju&s;tification of the&s;e churches.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to it, I &s;hall</P>
<P N="3">3. Make &s;ome brief improvement of the main <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> in the demon&s;tration; that is to &s;ay, if the government of the go&s;pel churches, be a democracy, the&s;e con&s;equences mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, <HI>&s;cil.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Con&s;.</HI> That the right of convoking councils eccle|&s;ia&s;tical, is in the churches.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Con&s;.</HI> That &s;uch a council has only con&s;ultative not a juridical power in it. A juridical power committed to &s;uch a repre&s;entative body is both needle&s;s, and al&s;o dangerous to the di&s;tinct and perfect &s;tates they derive from. Compleat &s;tates &s;ettled upon a body of immutable and imperial laws as its ba&s;is, may want council; but to create a new &s;ubject of juridical power, is &s;ome way to endanger the being of the creators.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Con&s;.</HI> That all the members of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council, deriving from a democracy are &s;ubjects of equal power. Whatever the power is, the &s;everal delegates mu&s;t from the nature of the government they derive from, be equal &s;harers in it. Democratical &s;tates, in their repre|&s;entative body can make but one hou&s;e, becau&s;e they have but one &s;ubject of &s;upream power in their nature, and there|fore their delegates, let them be who or what they may be, are under equal t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t; &s;o that none can ju&s;tly claim &s;upe|riority over their fellows, or pretend to a higher power in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;uffrage. Indeed in &s;uch kingdoms, where the &s;ove|reign power is di&s;tributed and &s;ettled in divers &s;ubjects, that the ballance of power may be more even, for the &s;afety of the whole, and of all parts under all acts of &s;ove|reign power: From &s;uch a &s;ettlement of power, there ari&s;es &s;everal di&s;tinct &s;tates in the &s;ame government, which when convened as one &s;ubject of &s;overeign power, they make dif|ferent hou&s;es in their grand &s;e&s;&s;ions; and &s;o one hou&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="46" REF="012626_0045_0F8B8F3905023618">
&s;tate can negative another. But in every di&s;tinct hou&s;e of the&s;e &s;tates, the members are equal in their vote; the mo&s;t ayes make the affirmative vote, and mo&s;t no's the nega|tive: They don't weigh the intellectual furniture, or other di&s;tingui&s;hing qualifications of the &s;everal voters in the &s;cales of the golden rule of fellow&s;hip; they only add up the ayes, and the no's, and &s;o determine the &s;uffrage of the hou&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>Demon&s;tration III. From Holy Scripture.</HEAD>
<P>THIS plea has with &s;uch variety of argument, and illu&s;tration, and by many repetitions, been pur&s;ued, by a great number of per&s;ons emi|nent for learning and piety, that I might here very fairly relea&s;e my&s;elf from this ta&s;k. But yet to compleat the number of my arguments, I will briefly &s;um up the de|mon&s;tration for the readers u&s;e under a few heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. Head. It mu&s;t needs be allowed, as a fundamental principle relating to government, that (under God) all power is originally in the people. No man I think will deny it to be a very &s;ound principle in civil knowledge. But if any man will, I imagine it is &s;ufficiently &s;et forth in the former demon&s;tration. And it is very plain that religion does always cultivate, and increa&s;e, rather than dimini&s;h any of natures ju&s;t prerogatives. That it mu&s;t needs &s;tand for a paradox, or a riddle not to be expounded; if man is more of a &s;lave by his religion than by his nature.</P>
<P>But let us take a brief view of man by &s;cripture account under a religious notion, as the &s;ubject of grace, and he &s;eems then not to have the lea&s;t &s;peck of va&s;&s;alage in him; but is repre&s;ented as though lord of him&s;elf and owner of heaven, and earth both, 1 Cor. 3.22.&mdash;<HI>all are yours.</HI></P>
<P>And though its very certain that man has greatly de|ba&s;ed him&s;elf by his apo&s;tacy; yet &s;till God puts abun|dance of honor upon him in his reduction. As we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y con&s;ider man in a remark or two, under the mea&s;ures of divine grace in re&s;toring him to favor. Fir&s;t, God treats him as a creature of a very honorable character, as free and at his own di&s;po&s;e. Or as though he were &s;ome high and mighty &s;tate placed at the top of this globe. There|fore he courts him into an alliance as though he were likely to yield great honor to the crown. <HI>We are amba&s;&s;adors&mdash;
<PB N="47" REF="012626_0046_0F8B8F3A35D07188">
as though God did be&s;eech you by us; we pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead&mdash;be reconciled to God,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.20. This is much the tenor of Gods heralds in their addre&s;&s;es of capitulation. That certainly if God did not highly e&s;timate man, as a creature exalted, by his rea&s;on, liberty and noblene&s;s of nature, he would not care&s;s him as he does in order to his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but rather with &s;ome peevi&s;h and haughty monarch, or the bloody Mahomet, &s;end his demands at the mouth of his canon. But in&s;tead of &s;uch har&s;h mea|&s;ures, they are treated with the highe&s;t rea&s;on, attended with lenity and great acts of conde&s;cention. Nay, divine menaces are frequently cloathed with &s;uch &s;oft language as this; <HI>turn ye! turn ye! Why will ye dye!</HI> Yea under all impul&s;ive means, which God wi&s;ely and graciou&s;ly makes u&s;e of to gain mans con&s;ent, he &s;ets the will to turn about it&s;elf without forcing it, that &s;o mans religion may be the free and candid emanations of his noble and ex|alted nature. But when God has thus gained man; may we rationally imagine that in erecting his trophies he will a&s;&s;ign and make him over to &s;ome petty and arbitrary po|tentates in matters of religion? or &s;ettle him under a di&s;|potic government as tho' he was the &s;poils of a &s;piteful war? No certainly, but man mu&s;t now be con&s;idered as &s;ome high allie inve&s;ted with more power than ever. This would &s;till be more evident if we &s;hould con&s;ider what Chri&s;t has done and how they &s;tand joint heirs with him in his purcha&s;e and kingdom, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1, 16, 17.</P>
<P N="2">2. Head. The power placed in man that enables him to manage religious affairs, is not &s;overeign, but limited and confined power. (1) All laws are enacted already, and, (2.) There is no coercive power needful in the church. The highe&s;t act in admini&s;tring judicature, is excluding a per&s;on out of the &s;ociety. In the church there is no fees or fines, &amp;c. In civil empire to keep mankind in any good decorum, there's much hard work to be done, in peace and war; under mein proce&s;s, and in criminal cau&s;es. There's forming of armies, rai&s;ing the po&s;&s;e comitatus, building of ca&s;tles, &amp;c. cropping of ears, chopping off hands, and what not! &s;o that civil government has need of an im|mence power as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> trea&s;ure, and to be cloathed with bra&s;s and iron.

home-born, it may be done by &s;oft words, or hard words, 1 The&s;. 5.12. Heb. 3.13.&mdash;10.24.25. So that the bu&s;ine&s;s does not require abundance of external force, or form of government. That it's a thou&s;and pities to make &s;uch a great noi&s;e and bu&s;tle in the world about church power, as though the &s;ubjects of it were to furni&s;h armies and navies to encounter half the potentates on earth in de|fence of the church. When alas good men! as to all occa&s;ion for power its quite another thing; and the exer|ci&s;e of it generally falls within reach of an ordinary rea&s;on. That certainly whatever the right of the brotherhood is as to the original of power; there cannot be abundance of bad omens in allowing them &s;ome &s;hare in church judica|tory.</P>
<P N="3">3. Head. Power&mdash;this word &s;eems to be all thunder. But however; it is very copious and may be applyed to God and his creatures. It is predicable of the latter, in their different cla&s;&s;es and orders of being, and none &s;o weak but have &s;ome &s;hare of it. But to confine the word to polity, &amp;c. It is by &s;ome thus defined, viz.</P>
<P>Power or authority&mdash;Is that whereby a man may claim, or challenge any thing to ones &s;elf, without the injury of another, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, this is a true definition.</P>
<P>Query. <HI>Whether chri&s;tian people may not claim or chal|lenge the following rights or prerogatives without doing in|jury to any,</HI> viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether if they are plea&s;ed (a &s;uitable number of them) to enter into a religious &s;ociety, by punctual and voluntary compacts to &s;upport the wor&s;hip of God in the world; whether this may not be done without injuring and then,</P>
<P N="2">2. When &s;o united, whether they may not chu&s;e their own officers. (3.) Di&s;cipline their own members. (4) Repre&s;ent them&s;elves upon proper emergencies, by their delegates; (all which are the principal pillars of a demo|cracy,) whether I &s;ay they, can't do all the&s;e without in|jury done to any others? But to proceed a little farther in opening the nature of power. If we unite <HI>Dunamis</HI> and <HI>Exou&s;ia, viz.</HI> Strength of nature, and authority of in&s;titu|tion into one propo&s;ition. Then political power may be thus defined. <HI>&s;cil.</HI></P>
<P>Power is an ability, furni&s;hed with a lawful right to act. Now upon a pre&s;umption of the validity of this propo&s;i|tion;
<PB N="49" REF="012626_0048_0F8B8F3B45F58EF8">
power may be ea&s;ily apprehended as ve&s;ted in every church, and in every member and officer of a church, ac|cording to the nature, degree and duty of each &s;ubject of power; and may act and exert their &s;everal powers and authorities without any incongruity, or interfering one with another.</P>
<P N="4">4. Head. That a go&s;pel church e&s;&s;entially con&s;idered as a body incorporated, is the &s;ubject of all church power. Though a church thus con&s;idered cannot formally exerci&s;e all branches of power belonging to it: neither can the &s;ubject of &s;overeign power it&s;elf exert all acts of power till fitted with proper organs or a &s;uitable mini&s;try, and yet it can't be denied but that all power really, and all acts of power virtually, mu&s;t needs be in it. And &s;o in a church.</P>
<P>Therefore as to church power in the exerci&s;e of it; it may be di&s;tributed into what belongs (1) To the combi|nation of many, viz. The power of judgment and dona|tion. Or, (2.) To what belongs to one or more &s;et off for that end, viz. The power of office. This di&s;tribution Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> pur&s;ues with great illu&s;tration. <HI>Surv. p.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 187. Here I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the con&s;ideration of the exerci&s;e of that power which belongs to the brother|hood in di&s;tinction to office power. Which principle I &s;hall pur&s;ue by evincing the truths of the following pro|po&s;ition. <HI>&s;cil.</HI></P>
<P>That the &s;cripture does warrant a government in go&s;|pel churches, con&s;i&s;ting of the exerci&s;e of &s;everal di&s;tinct powers inherent in the fraternity, in di&s;tinction to office tru&s;t. This may be evinced.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the recitation of the &s;everal di&s;tinct powers them|&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the dignity which the &s;criptures puts upon the churches as free &s;tates, and &s;ubjects of power in di&s;tinction from their officers.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the recitation of the &s;everal di&s;tinct powers; both preparitory to, and re&s;ulting from their combination.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a preparatory power in them both as ratio|nal &amp; &s;anctified beings of forming them&s;elves into churches. This affirmation &s;eems to me as fully contained in the genuine &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, as though written in &s;ome di|vine manife&s;to, in &s;uch terms as the&s;e, viz. Let this be
<PB N="50" REF="012626_0049_0F8B8F3EE2EB4CF0">
proclaimed through all the earth, that I the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, have inve&s;ted all holy and good chri&s;tian people, both by nature and grace with power, to enter into church order, for the advance of my name, and their own edification. If we had &s;uch an article in &s;cripture written in terms, we &s;hould have made great u&s;e of it in ju&s;tifying our con&s;titution; for it plainly &s;ettles all power original|ly (under Chri&s;t) in the people. And then if &s;uch a power or faculty be in them when in &s;eparate parts, as to a&s;&s;emble, and enter into &s;olemn engagements, and thereby to enter into a church &s;tate; it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that having imbodied they may ea&s;ily go forward and provide for their own well-being. He that hath read the go&s;pel, and ob&s;erved how many churches are mentioned, without notice taken, of the manner of their origination, mu&s;t needs allow the ob&s;ervation to be a fair con&s;equence from it. It being &s;o agreable with the light of nature.</P>
<P N="2">2. The powers re&s;ulting from their combination may be more di&s;tinctly recited.</P>
<P N="1">1. Power. The election of officers. Officers are for the well-being, and compleating of any &s;tate. There is no re|gular government can well &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them; the&s;e are the hands, the eyes, the ears and feet of government in admini&s;tration. To &s;eparate qualified per&s;ons to the highe&s;t office tru&s;t in a &s;tate, is by civilians attributed to the creating power of &s;overeignity. So that it mu&s;t needs be a great power belonging to the church under this head, and that it is the churches prerogative I might rea|&s;on; <HI>Ex Jure Superioritatis.</HI> For that the church is &s;upe|rior to its officers; and not the officers to the church. For that churches are not made for officers, but officers for churches; therefore &s;ays the apo&s;tle, 1 Cor. 3.22. <HI>All things are yours&mdash;whether Paul, or Apollos or Cephas.</HI> But I &s;hall principally depend upon the example and prac|tice of the apo&s;tolical church under this head. It is a celebrated &s;aying of <HI>Cyprian</HI> in pre&s;&s;ing, Acts 1.26. To confirm the power of the people in chu&s;ing and refu&s;ing their officers. <HI>Plebs Chri&s;tiana maxime pote&s;tatem habet, vel Dignos Sacerdotes Eligendi, vel indignos Recu&s;andi.</HI> The highe&s;t power of electing worthy officers and rejecting unworthy is in the people. For the whole church, &s;ays <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rettinus (de Jure Vo.) Duos Eligit,</HI> chu&s;es two to under|go the lot for the apo&s;tle&s;hip, that they might &s;upply the
<PB N="51" REF="012626_0050_0F8B8F411C260630">
vacancy by the death of <HI>Judas,</HI> Acts 1.23, 26. And in|deed it is contrary to all civility and rea&s;on to imagine the apo&s;tles would be &s;o trivial in their mini&s;try, or prodigal of their own authority, as to indulge the fraternity in &s;uch actions, viz. Such as electing an extraordinary officer, if the election of officers did not belong to them. So in the choice of the deacons mentioned, Acts. 6.2, 3, 5. The twelve called the multitude of the di&s;ciples unto them, and &s;aid&mdash;brethren look you out &s;even men, whom we may appoint over this bu&s;ine&s;s. The &s;aying plea&s;ed the whole multitude and they cho&s;e Stephen, &amp;c. It mu&s;t needs be very &s;urprizing, if the apo&s;tles &s;hould thus dignify, and intru&s;t the brethren with a prerogative of electing the&s;e officers, if the power of election was not inherent in them. That unle&s;s any one can fairly make it out that the apo&s;tles were either in je&s;t, or did they know not what, in direct|ing the brethren, to do as they did in the recited examples; it mu&s;t needs &s;tand for a truth that the power of electing officers is in the fraternity of the church, by the judgment of Chri&s;t's apo&s;tles.</P>
<P N="2">2. Power judicatory, Mat. 18.15, 20. This para|graph of holy writ, lays open a &s;cheme of juridical power in the &s;ubject of it; that is the church: and this is to be ob&s;erved, that from the fir&s;t commencement of the proce&s;s to the final i&s;&s;ue in the execution of the ob&s;tinate and criminal member, all is to be a&s;cribed to the authority of the church; for what bu&s;ine&s;s has one man to interrupt another in his crimes and unlawful plea&s;ures, unle&s;s he has power &s;o to do? And how comes one man to have power over another, unle&s;s conque&s;t, ho&s;tility, or compacts have made them liable, as members of the &s;ame community, or &s;ubjects of the &s;ame government? Therefore the offended per&s;on, proceeding regularly for detecting a delinquent, mu&s;t needs be &s;uppo&s;ed to derive his power from the &s;ame fountain, viz. the &s;e&s;&s;ions were the ca&s;e is finally to i&s;&s;ue by execution. And the &s;ubject of this power is the church. <HI>Tell the church.</HI></P>
<P>But moreover, let it be con&s;idered, that to &s;peak by way of allu&s;ion, there be &s;everal removes of the action of tre&s;pa&s;s, from one hearing to another; as though it go from an inferior to a &s;uperior &s;e&s;&s;ions, and that Chri&s;t was here in this precept, &s;ettling inferior and &s;uperior a&s;&s;izes in his kingdom. And indeed there cannot be a wi&s;er
<PB N="52" REF="012626_0051_0F8B8F418514A8C0">
&s;cheme drawn up, that &s;hall carry the a&s;pect of more grace, love, humility, tender regard to honour, and al&s;o ju&s;tice than this; both for the encouragement of religion, the awing of &s;pectators, and keeping the church pure.</P>
<P>But to proceed,</P>
<P N="1">1. In making out proce&s;s, the fir&s;t trial is to be had at the a&s;&s;izes of a mans own intellectual powers, rea&s;on, con|&s;cience, &amp;c. being a&s;&s;embled, are to &s;et in judgment, hear the pleas, and the indictment being read and ju&s;tified, mu&s;t pa&s;s &s;entence; and at this bar the ca&s;e may be fairly i&s;&s;ued. <HI>If he &s;hall hear thee thou ha&s;t gained thy brother.</HI> So that mo&s;t certainly the plaintiff has a right to enter his ca&s;e at this &s;e&s;&s;ions, and here we &s;ee it may be i&s;&s;ued; then certainly this is a branch of the power of judicature; otherwi&s;e an agrieved per&s;on might expect a very &s;evere repul&s;e from a &s;turdier offender, for interrupting a mans repo&s;e of mind in his own actions. What &s;aucy clown is that? who dare challenge my con&s;cience with the cognizance of any crime? Bold-face! where's you commi&s;&s;ion; <HI>Who made thee a ruler,</HI> Acts 7.27. In civil affairs particular men when injured, mu&s;t not make bold to correct an ordinary tre&s;pa&s;s upon their per&s;ons, or intere&s;ts, but by forms of law; if they do, e&s;pecially if by mea&s;ures which are grievous, they may be indicted them&s;elves, for di&s;turbers of the peace; That certainly this branch of the text refers to a legal bar, and lawful power. So that the complaining party may commence his &s;uit with boldne&s;s, produce his pleas, and demand ju&s;tice. But the critical que&s;tion is, <HI>Who is judge of this court?</HI> Certainly it is &s;ome lay-mans powers, &s;uppo&s;ed to be very competent judges, as &s;uffici|ently &s;killed in the rules of court, and how to apply them. And why may not all the judges contained in the whole &s;eries of judicatory laid open in this text, be of the &s;ame &s;ort? for that the ca&s;e is not &s;o deep, but that the fir&s;t judges and &s;e&s;&s;ions it comes before, are &s;uppo&s;ed by our wi&s;e Saviour and law-giver, capable fully to under&s;tand and traver&s;e it; and do ju&s;tice and judgment upon it; to a final i&s;&s;ue. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. Upon a defeat the proce&s;s goes forward, by remov|ing the &s;uit by an appeal to a more impartial hearing. The next &s;e&s;&s;ions therefore by review, is to con&s;i&s;t of one or two of the brethren. <HI>(Take one or two more.)</HI> But po&s;|&s;ibly &s;ome may be ready to &s;ay, ah! <HI>We are like to have
<PB N="53" REF="012626_0052_0F8B8F4249B89DF0">
very good ju&s;tice, before &s;o wi&s;e a &s;e&s;&s;ions!</HI> Well, it is what Chri&s;t has appointed, and let us keep his path, and it will bring us &s;afe home; for that the&s;e per&s;ons are commi&s;|&s;ioned by Chri&s;t, as capable judges, and therefore are to exerci&s;e one branch of the power fixed in the church. But when the ca&s;e is gone thus far through the law, and the adver&s;e party will not &s;ubmit to the la&s;t verdict that is brought in, the ca&s;e mu&s;t be removed again. For that,</P>
<P N="3">3. It is allowed to have one trial more, and no more; and that is to be before the church. For if he hear not the church, he &s;hall be as an heathen man, &amp;c. that is to &s;ay, the church &s;hall then i&s;&s;ue out execution, which is the end of the law.</P>
<P>Object. But the great and &s;tupendous objection, which cro&s;&s;es our way, is, that the governing church is here meant; that is to &s;ay, the pre&s;bytery in their cla&s;&s;es, and &s;everal &s;e&s;&s;ions, till you come home to the la&s;t appeal?</P>
<P>An&s;w. 1. It is very un&s;criptural to force &s;uch an inter|pretation on the text; for if we con&s;ider the etimology, and univer&s;al acceptation of the word church, the objection will be found very defective, both in its rhetori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k and divinity. There being no harbour for it, within the &s;en&s;e of <HI>Farniby</HI>'s tropes or figures. And as for its divinity, let the objection but cite one text more, wherein church is mentioned, and officers are intended, and we will re&s;ign. But without it to yield &s;o great an intere&s;t upon &s;o &s;lender a claim is repugnant to ju&s;tice and honor. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. How can wi&s;e men manage their &s;ouls, or bring them into &s;uch a figure as to think that Chri&s;t &s;hould have &s;uch a far reach in his thoughts in &s;uch ea&s;y ca&s;es as are plainly contained in the text? The notions in the objec|tions are plainly ridiculous to the light of nature, in that civil mea&s;ures adju&s;t according to the degree and nature of &s;uits and ca&s;es. A cau&s;e of twelve-pence is triable by a &s;ingle ju&s;tice, and one a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">peal brings the &s;uit to the end of the law. Indeed ca&s;es which are of greater weight and value have a larger &s;cope in the law allowed them, &amp;c. And what! Is there the lea&s;t &s;hadow for a pretence that &s;uch ca&s;es as are within our text, viz. &s;uch as may be i&s;&s;ued by one &s;ingle brother making his &s;uit to his brothers rea&s;on and con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ience, &amp;c. or by two at the mo&s;t, and that at the &s;ole charge of a few hone&s;t pleas from the heads of charity or piety? I &s;ay, are the&s;e ca&s;es &s;o grand as to be tran&s;|mitted from one cla&s;&s;is to another, till they arrive at the
<PB N="54" REF="012626_0053_0F8B8F42E08E4A20">
chief &s;eat where the definitive &s;entence is to be given forth? There is apparently &s;ome great fallacy in the objection, or certainly our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour did not &s;tate his ca&s;es right; for let us again con&s;ider, who mu&s;t &s;ign the bill of co&s;t at la&s;t? or who mu&s;t bear all the charges of writings, witne&s;&s;es, travels of hor&s;es and men; and for all expence of time and money, from the &s;e&s;&s;ions fir&s;t mentioned, and &s;o from &s;e&s;&s;ions to &s;e&s;&s;ions, and from cla&s;&s;is to cla&s;&s;is, until all is brought to a final i&s;&s;ue? when as po&s;&s;ibly the original writ of proce&s;s, or fir&s;t action, might not contain in real civil damage, a farthing more than about a groat or &s;ix-pence. And what can we think that our wi&s;e Saviour would adju&s;t his &s;ettlements at no better a rate than this comes to? <HI>vah! proh Dolor!</HI> Men have plainly made a fool of mankind by corrupting this text, whereby they have &s;et the di&s;cipline of the church at &s;uch a charge, that millions of millions have run out in wa&s;te, to humour their ambition; when as the wi&s;e and innocent churches of God in their &s;ingle capacities would have done better ju&s;tice, and have drained nothing more from you, than &s;ome tears of contrition.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="3">3. What is more natural, than to imagine a church of believers, with their &s;et of graces, and common prudence, (e&s;pecially when under the influence of a regular mini&s;try) &s;hould be held capable to execute this rule, according to the full &s;en&s;e of it; yea, tho' they bring the delinquent in the traver&s;e of the ca&s;e, to the highe&s;t cen&s;ure. Indeed it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that excommunication, major or minor, is an awful re&s;ult of authority; yet not really in every re&s;pect, and in all degrees quite &s;o bitter as death it|&s;elf: And yet death is very frequently di&s;pens'd to capital &s;inners, and that &s;olely by the verdict of their peers, viz. Twenty-four good and lawful men of the vicinage, are in forms of law a &s;ufficent judicatory to take away a mans life, and the venerable bench of judges mu&s;t not over-rule, but &s;tand and &s;ay, Amen, in that good ju&s;tice is done in the world by &s;uch a &s;mall company of illiterate men, the law having a&s;&s;igned them to this &s;ervice. To the foregoing precept, let us join Col. 4.17. 1 Cor. 5.12. Rev. 2.20. 1 The&s;. 5.14. Gal. 6.1.</P>
<P>Now to conclude, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the reader lay all the&s;e &s;criptures together, which contain rules of judicatory for the churches;
<PB N="55" REF="012626_0054_0F8B8F4388AE03F0">
and then let him an&s;wer me with good rea&s;on if h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> can, and tell me why the&s;e &s;criptures may not be e&s;teemed the churches <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> in matters of cen&s;ure and judica|ture; as well as that be held &s;uch a golden rule in the judicial proceedings of Engli&s;h government, mentioned in the great charter of Engli&s;h liberties, chap. 29. No freeman &s;hall be taken, or impri&s;oned, or be di&s;&s;ei&s;ed of his freehold, liberty or free cu&s;toms, or be out-law'd or ex|iled, or any other ways de&s;troyed, nor will we pre&s;s upon him nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his peers. Now gentlemen! Don't you think that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the king of heaven, is as careful and tender of his &s;ubjects, as the king of England is of his? And indeed, why &s;hould not each &s;ett of &s;ubjects be equally and alike guarded from the hazard of oppre&s;&s;ion, or the arbi|trary mea&s;ures of each mini&s;try unle&s;s tho&s;e that belong to the go&s;pel, are formed out of a di&s;tinct clay from each other?</P>
<P N="3">3. Power. To repre&s;ent them&s;elves in &s;ynodical con|ventions, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this power in the churches. See Acts 15.2.22.23. And for a more ample di&s;play and confirmation of this point, I refer the reader to the excellent treati&s;e of Dr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather,</HI> in his di&s;qui&s;ition concerning <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical councils.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The dignity which the &s;cripture puts upon the churches as free &s;tates, and &s;ubjects of power in di&s;tinction from their officers.</P>
<P>It is very plain that mo&s;t of the epi&s;tles of St. <HI>Paul</HI> which make up a great part of the canon of &s;cripture, were directed to the body of the brotherhood, and peculi|arly adapted for their u&s;e, with little or no notice at all taken of the mini&s;try therein.</P>
<P>In &s;um, when he was ju&s;t concluding his letter and winding up his di&s;cour&s;e with his grace and re&s;pects to &s;ome choice chri&s;tian friends, he puts the officers in with them, and orders the brotherhood to give his &s;alutations to them as per&s;ons unconcerned with the contents of the epi&s;tle, Heb. 13.24. In the la&s;t ver&s;e but one in the whole epi&s;tle, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>Salute all them that have the rule over.</HI> That whatever other meanings may be in &s;uch methods of divine writings, they mu&s;t needs re&s;pect &s;ome high powers and tru&s;t ve&s;ted in the churches. Tho&s;e epi&s;tles &s;ent to the angels of the churches of <HI>A&s;ia</HI>; the principal &s;hare of tho&s;e letters literally taken, which belonged to the officers,
<PB N="56" REF="012626_0055_0F8B8F4444975AA0">
is but the &s;uper&s;cription; the contents of the letters are immediately directed to the fraternity. Where there is any thing ami&s;s the fraternity is reprehended: Where there is any thing worthy of credit, they are commended. Or if there is any thing in point of order or di&s;cipline to be done they are directed and commanded. All is to the churches. Therefore it is &s;aid again and again, <HI>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the &s;pirit &s;aith unto the churches,</HI> Rev. 1.7, &amp;c. Finally, let any con|&s;iderate man but read and well ponder the epi&s;tles to the <HI>Corinthian, Ephe&s;ian,</HI> &amp;c. churches, and ob&s;erve the characters of the brotherhood; with the precepts how they &s;hall act per&s;onally and with authority one towards another, &amp;c. he mu&s;t then needs &s;ubject his mind to the force of this conclu&s;ion, <HI>&s;cil.</HI> That Chri&s;t's go&s;pel churches in their fra|ternities, are not &s;uch cyphers as they &s;tand in &s;ome men's accounts; but are really and truly proper bodies full of powers, and authorities, for the government of them&s;elves and all their concerns, as all democracies are.</P>

<P>From the excellent nature of the con&s;titution, in that it exceeds all that have been yet extant in the chri&s;tian world. This I &s;hall endeavor to illu&s;trate by three pleas. <HI>Plea</HI> I.</P>
<P>In that it be&s;t &s;uits the great and noble de&s;igns of the go&s;pel, and that in a peculiar manner as it tends to the promoting holine&s;s in the world; not only from the &s;trict nature of the con&s;titution in the admi&s;&s;ion of members, whence the churches become a more exact emblem of hea|ven, both for the illuminating and dreading of others, that beholding their goodne&s;s, may glorify God in the day of vi&s;itation. 1 Pet. 2.12. But from the great advantage put into the hands of the be&s;t &s;ort of men, (&s;olid, pious, wi&s;e and unbias'd men) of furni&s;hing a country with per|&s;ons eminently qualified for the mini&s;try, and keeping them &s;o.

<P>For that it has the be&s;t ballance belonging to it of any church-government in the world. Other governments have generally too high a top, and are very lop&s;ided too; nay the be&s;t we can meet with without vanity or envy it may be &s;aid, that not only &s;eemingly like <HI>Grantham</HI> &s;teeple, but really it &s;tands awry, and being &s;o overloaded on na|ture's corrupt &s;ide, with learning, power and high tru&s;t, it plainly hangs over &s;everal degrees from a true perpen|dicular, towards Babylon: And if it falls it buries you; and then you mu&s;t remember it has monopolized all power, &s;o that you have none left to &s;tir under your load, or creep out with. But here's a government &s;o exactly poi&s;ed, that it keeps its motions regular like the &s;tupenduous &s;pheres, unle&s;s &s;ome <HI>Phaeton</HI> chance to mount the chariot box, and becomes the driver. I have &s;ufficiently, I think, evinced the power in the brotherhood; and though every church is a body con&s;i&s;ting of very numerous parts and a noble m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ni&s;try, yet the balance of power is very exactly and with great advantage pre&s;erved; both between the members of the body in general, and between them&s;elves, and their public mini&s;try in &s;pecial.</P>
<P N="1">1. Between the members of the body. For be&s;ides, the wi&s;dom, love and other enobling principles, in &s;ome mea&s;ure actuating every member. The venerable major vote, which guides and governs the augu&s;t &s;tates of parlia|ments; nay all a&s;&s;embly's &s;uperior and inferior, that have any equality of power di&s;per&s;ed among&s;t the members, or|dinarily keeps the whole body, in all points of admini&s;tra|tion, in an exact equipoi&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. And as for the &s;tate of the mini&s;try; there is no grain of allowance wanted on their &s;ide, to make their office power, if not an even ballance arithmetically upon an accurate, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing trial: yet in the &s;eries of a laudable mini&s;tration, it is an equivalent of power; at lea&s;t according to the terms of our con&s;titution, <HI>Platf.

as may be, and let every fair principle which grants the power to be originally in the people, be yielded: and al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;h a proper judicature in the brotherhood; yet it's apparent in all examples, that the mini&s;try of this con&s;ti|tution are held, if not in proper &s;peaking; yet in con|&s;cience, and religious courte&s;ie, as though all power were inve&s;ted in them; or at lea&s;t to &s;uch a degree that there is no appearance of what many render the government grevious to them, if they are but contented, to be the ma&s;ters of an a&s;&s;embly of free-men, and not of &s;laves. Among&s;t abundance of illu&s;trations I will mention two.</P>
<P N="1">1. The great veneration in man's mind towards tho&s;e who are &s;en&s;ibly cloathed with authority. <HI>If I am a fa|ther where it my honor, if a ma&s;ter where is my fear,</HI> Mat. 1.6. The prophet rea&s;ons from the law of nature; there being &s;uch a property planted in the &s;oul by its maker to revere &s;uperiors, and e&s;pecially men in public tru&s;t. And al&s;o the authority &s;hining in them, being &s;uch bright rays both of the divine maje&s;ty and benignity, there being &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible good and benefit accruing thereby, to the re&s;t of mankind, hence &s;prings a univer&s;al di&s;po&s;ition to obedience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, this is obvious through the whole civil mini&s;try of the world; there is no need to make every judge in commi&s;&s;ion, or chief magi&s;trate a &s;overeign prince to gain homage to him. No! but as &s;oon as a man ap|pears ve&s;ted with authority, there is that in the &s;oul of another which teaches reverence and obedience to him in his tru&s;t, both from the &s;ugge&s;tions of fear and &s;en&s;e of intere&s;t. So that a learned, painful and pious mini&s;try in|tru&s;ted with the &s;ouls and happine&s;s of men; and taking indefatigable care to &s;ecure eternal life for them, has a mo&s;t charming and endearing a&s;pect and influence upon all the rational powers. In &s;o much that nature it&s;elf has a high value for &s;uch &s;ubjects of tru&s;t. And as for grace its ready to be lavi&s;h of its victims.&mdash;ye received me as an angel of God even as Chri&s;t Je&s;us.&mdash;If it had been po&s;&s;ible ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.14, 15. If any man doubts of the validity of this plea, let him but view what conque&s;ts have been made by the abu&s;e of the&s;e principles, and you will find the mini&s;try of the chri&s;tian world have far exceeded <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> in &s;ubduing mankind; for from an hone&s;t obedience they have brought them to lye down, &amp;

be trampled on by their &s;piritual owners. That there is no danger on the poople's &s;ide when things are well &s;tated, if there be but a wi&s;e and due management on the other.</P>
<P>And &s;till it is more evident.</P>
<P N="2">2. From the extent of commi&s;&s;ion, with the many enob|ling prerogatives fixed in their tru&s;t. Though they are the mini&s;try, and but the mini&s;try of a democracy, their commi&s;&s;ion is &s;o large, and high-prerogatives &s;o numerous, they carry &s;o great an appearance, as though in reality they were the &s;ubjects of all power. And I think it is &s;o from the nature and modes of all regular government; for when a government has enacted their laws and precepts, and &s;ettled their mini&s;try, they leave the &s;way of things to them; that it is as tho' they had re&s;igned all the power to their mini&s;try: So it is peculiarly in the affairs of go&s;pel churches. That let men at their lei&s;ure view this illu&s;tra|tion by the &s;cripture, our platform, and by the laws and cu&s;toms of nations, and they will find it a truth. That certainly a painful mini&s;try may ea&s;ily be reconciled to our con&s;titution, unle&s;s they are rai&s;ed to that temper of mind as he was, who had this for his motto, <HI>Aut Cae&s;ar&punc; aut Nihil.</HI> A <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> or nothing.</P>

<P>From the near affinity our con&s;titution holds with the civil governments of &s;ome of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing common-wealths in the world. It's certain, every &s;pecies of go|vernment &s;imple and mixt, have their various excellencies and defects; much may be &s;aid in honor of each, and al&s;o every con&s;titution may have &s;omething wanting; at lea&s;t it may &s;eem &s;o, under a more critical &s;urvey of its nature, principles, ill-conveniencies, corrupt mini&s;try, mis|fortunes, &amp;c. And many times a government falls under &s;candal from di&s;temper of mind, from fal&s;e ends and cor|rupt intere&s;ts, which &s;way and over-rule mens thoughts relating to government, more than from the con&s;titution it&s;elf. But however, to evade all circular di&s;cour&s;es, we may very fairly infer, where we find nations flouri&s;hing, and their liberty and property, with the re&s;t o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the great immunities of mans nature nouri&s;hed, &s;ecured, and be&s;t guarded from tyranny, we may venture to pronounce this people to be the &s;ubjects of a noble government, and there be many &s;uch on earth, who&s;e con&s;titution will &s;erve to ju&s;tify ours. I &s;hall in&s;tance in three, and no more.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="60" REF="012626_0059_0F8B8F48EF14CF88">1. The <HI>Venetian</HI> common-wealth; though &s;ome are plea&s;ed to call the government of this free &s;tate, an ari&s;to|cracy; but it &s;eems more properly a limited democracy; for that the &s;eat of &s;overeign power is their ancient com|mons, called their families, enrolled in the golden book; the&s;e make up the grand council of the nations, &s;ettle the public mini&s;try, and enact laws, &amp;c. This people have by this mode of government rai&s;ed them&s;elves into &s;o augu&s;t and flouri&s;hing a capacity, that from a very ob&s;cure origi|nal, they are grown to that degree, as to bridle and curb the pride and haughtine&s;s of Turk and Pope. This ex|ample mu&s;t needs be no &s;mall honor to our con&s;titution.</P>
<P>But,</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Belgick</HI> provinces are without interruption al|lowed to be the &s;ubjects of a formed democracy, they in &s;ome ages pa&s;t being in&s;ulted, and unmercifully trampled upon by that augu&s;t tyrant, the Spani&s;h Monarch; they being his &s;ubjects broke loo&s;e from him, and &s;et up for them&s;elves. They a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves their original power, and when they had got it into their hands, had the wit, and kept it, and have improved it in the form of a democracy to this day, and God has ble&s;t them: That from the poor &s;tates of Holland, they are now grown to wear the &s;plendid title of <HI>Their High Mightine&s;&s;es,</HI> and are a match for mo&s;t monarchs on earth. Says Gordon of their government: The &s;even provinces of Holland being under a democratical government, are as it were &s;everal common-wealths; each province being a di&s;tinct &s;tate; yea, and every city having an independent power within it&s;elf to judge of all cau&s;es, whether civil or criminal, and to inflict even capital puni&s;hments; but all joining toge|ther, make one republic, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the world.</P>
<P><HI>Query.</HI> Whether &s;uch examples of popular governments now extant on earth, and yielding &s;uch va&s;t advantages to the &s;ubjects, and being &s;o regular and practicable; I &s;ay, whether they may not ju&s;tly deter all men from reproach|ing our con&s;titution with the &s;candalous title of anarchy, unle&s;s they will allow us to prepare a chronicle for them, and therein publi&s;h to the world their profound ignorance of the &s;everal &s;pecies of government; and the di&s;tinct way of placing and exerci&s;ing various powers in them. 3.

of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t incomparable government in the world. And this original happy form of government, is (&s;ays one) truly and properly called an Engli&s;h man's liberty: a privilege to be freed in per&s;on and e&s;tate from arbitrary violence and oppre&s;&s;ion; and a greater inheritance than we derive from our parents. And this birth-right of Engli&s;h men &s;hines mo&s;t con&s;piciou&s;ly in two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. In Parliaments; wherein the &s;ubject has by his re|pre&s;entatives, a &s;hare in legi&s;lative power: And &s;o makes his own laws, and di&s;po&s;es of his own money.</P>
<P N="2">2. In Jury's; whereby he has a &s;hare in the executive part of law, &s;o that no cau&s;es are tried, nor any man ad|judged to lo&s;e his life, member or e&s;tate, but upon the verdict of his peers; his equal or neighbours, and of his own condition. The&s;e two grand pillars of Engli&s;h liberty, are the fundamental vital privileges whereby we have been, and are &s;till pre&s;erved more free and happy, than any other people in the world; and we tru&s;t &s;hall ever continue &s;o. For who&s;oever &s;hall de&s;ign to impair, pervert, or undermine either of the&s;e, do &s;trike at the very con&s;titution of our government, and ought to be pro&s;ecuted and puni&s;hed, with the utmo&s;t zeal and vigour.&mdash;For to poy&s;on all the &s;prings and rivers in the kingdom, could not be a greater mifchief; for this would only affect the pre&s;ent age, but the other would ruin and en&s;lave all our po&s;terity. I &s;hall improve this example by three Queries.</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 1. Ah! What's the matter with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men, men of &s;uch courage to be &s;urprized with &s;uch fear, as tho' they were like to be taken captive, and turned into &s;laves in their own home? Why, in good truth, there may be a rea&s;on for it; therefore it becomes them to be very careful under this head; for if they make them&s;elves &s;laves in their own country, or let others do it for them, when they can prevent it, they both deny God who made and redeemed them, and plainly violate the law of nature?</P>
<P><HI>Query.</HI> 2. Who is it Engli&s;h men are thus afraid of? Who do they thus reflect upon in their frights and fears? It is neither France nor the great Turk which dreads them! therefore it mu&s;t needs be &s;ome body or another nearer home that threatens their liberty. And may not New-England's go&s;pel liberties de&s;erve &s;o much fear and cau|tion,
<PB N="62" REF="012626_0061_0F8B8F4BC3C491B0">
although it &s;hould &s;o happen that &s;ome body &s;hould be reflected upon by their cautiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Query.</HI> 3. If the &s;ettling &s;uch immunities, as the privilege of parliaments and juries in the hands of the peo|ple be &s;uch effectual barriers to pre&s;erve a nation from tyranny and &s;lavery; then whether when go&s;pel churches have the means in their own power, it been't their wi&s;dom to keep up the like barrier, or &s;omething equivalent there|to; that they may pre&s;erve them&s;elves &s;afe from the arbi|trary mea&s;ures of their own mini&s;try? or thus, whether for Engli&s;h men, when their liberties in church or &s;tate are fa&s;t lockt up for them and their po&s;terity by law and regular &s;ettlements, it been't their be&s;t way to beware how they repeal tho&s;e laws, or weaken tho&s;e &s;ettlements?</P>
<P>But at pre&s;ent I &s;hall leave it to other men to run the parrallel between our con&s;titution, and the &s;everal govern|ments I have mentioned, and infer what more they &s;hall think proper; only leaving to my&s;elf the liberty to con|clude, that the &s;everal examples of civil &s;tates, which I have named, do &s;erve abundantly to ju&s;tify the noble nature of our con&s;titution in church-order; for that the &s;everal famous and augu&s;t nations which I have mentioned, in all their glory at home, and &s;ucce&s;s in arms and trade abroad; their &s;everal governments which have brought them to all this, are either a perfect democracy, or very much mixed and blendi&s;hed with it.</P>
<P>Then why &s;hould we in New-England be any more a&s;hamed, or le&s;s careful of our church-government, which keeps us from tyranny and &s;lavery in the concerns of our con&s;ciences, than tho&s;e nations are of their civil govern|ment, whereby they are pre&s;erved from the like damnable circum&s;tances in the concerns of their outward life, and natural rights and fortunes?</P>

<P>From the dignity which the providence of God has put upon the con&s;titution, both in the fir&s;t ages of the chri&s;tian churches and in the la&s;t century.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the fir&s;t ages of the chri&s;tian churches God has put many marks of di&s;tingui&s;hing favour upon this con&s;titution, both in the &s;miles and frowns of his providence.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the &s;miles of providence upon the churches, whil&s;t they continued compleat in their con&s;titution. I &s;hall offer but three parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulars to ju&s;tify this ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="63" REF="012626_0062_0F8B8F4D9E2F3BE0">1. In the great and admirable &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel, in the conver&s;ion of &s;o many nations.</P>
<P N="2">2. In their &s;ingular purity, and virtuous deportment in the mid&s;t of a corrupt world. That (as Mr. Cotton ob|&s;erves) was a general eulogy belonging to their members, and a&s;cribed to them by the wi&s;er &s;ort of heathen, <HI>&s;cil. Bonus vir, tantum Chri&s;tianus,</HI> He is a good man only is a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="3">3. They were eminently &s;upported and carried on by the grace and providence of God through all their direful &s;ufferings; the more they were wa&s;ted and de&s;troyed, the more they grew and increa&s;ed, as I&s;rael in Egypt. Indeed whil&s;t they remained firm to their con&s;titution, they were not only like an army in banners, but in reality the greate&s;t conquerors that ever appeared on earth. They merely baffled the bravery of the old Roman &s;pirit, and were quite too hard for tho&s;e who had vanqui&s;hed the world. I have &s;een, &s;ays <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> the executioner (tired with tormenting them) lye down panting and breathing, &amp;c. But I never &s;aw the martyrs weary of &s;ufferings, nor heard them de&s;ire a truce: Nay, were rather ambitious of the longe&s;t and mo&s;t terrible &s;ufferings, that they might be martyrs in every member. Thus the churches endured hardne&s;s as good &s;oldiers of Chri&s;t, thro' ten bloody per&s;ecutions; and at la&s;t retreated by divine providence, under the um|brage of the great <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI> And there the churches of God made the fine&s;t &s;how that ever was &s;een on earth, next to Chri&s;t in his transfiguration. Till this time the churches remained the &s;ubjects of their democratical government in &s;ome good mea&s;ure though there were &s;ome &s;ymptoms of an alteration in the la&s;t century, but indeed after the churches were freed from the rage of heathen per&s;ecutors, there quickly followed the perfect &s;ubver&s;ion of their order.</P>
<P>So we come,</P>
<P N="2">2. To con&s;ider the frowns of Providence that pur&s;ued the chri&s;tian world after the &s;ubver&s;ion of their primitive con&s;titution. Sufficient ob&s;ervations have been made un|der the foregoing demon&s;trations, &s;etting forth the change of government which was made in the churches. And in &s;hort, it was really and properly the altering the mini&s;|try of a democracy into an ari&s;tocracy; for to &s;peak plainly, the public officers to gratify their ambition, took all the power into their own hands, and &s;ettled all affairs and
<PB N="64" REF="012626_0063_0F8B8F4E690B5AD0">
concerns acccording to their own minds without controul. But let us eye the providence of God, and we may ob&s;erve that God did &s;oon &s;tain the pride and glory of the&s;e men; e&s;pecially in two eminent in&s;tances of his di&s;plea&s;ure, which I &s;hall only mention.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;tance.</HI> 1. In the fatal <HI>Arian</HI> here&s;y, that &s;pread it &s;elf like &s;ome mortal contagion, thro' the chri&s;tian world? that it was &s;aid the whole world was become an <HI>Arian. Arius</HI> was the author of this damnable doctrine, viz. That our Saviour Chri&s;t was neither God, nor eternal, but a creature; and that he a&s;&s;umed only the body, not the &s;oul of man, &amp;c. This damnable here&s;y &s;oon &s;pread it&s;elf far and wide; the author was in the heighth of his wicked|ne&s;s, and fell a victim to divine vengeance in the latter part of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI>'s reign: But his here&s;y continued and prevailed, and e&s;pecially among&s;t the clergy. But this is very awful to ob&s;erve, that when the&s;e men by their wit and cunning had once cozened and cheated the fraternity of their ancient rights and prerogatives, God left the devil to cheat and deceive them, as wi&s;e and learned as they were, of their true religion and &s;ouls together. What good did all their legerdemain to them now? Had not they better have kept holy and humble pa&s;tors, confined to their parochial dioce&s;&s;es, and known and loved and preach't Chri&s;t the eternal Son of God, and him crucified, rather then &s;tretcht their boundary like &s;overeign princes, and &s;o left to peri&s;h under &s;uch a dreadful di&s;pen&s;ation, as the fruit of their ambition and infidelity?</P>
<P>To me (con&s;idering the commencement, the deadly na|ture, the rage, the univer&s;al prevalence and continuance of this damnable here&s;y) it &s;eems as though God had lookt down from heaven, and viewed the &s;acrilegious robbery commitied upon the churches with dete&s;tation. And there|fore &s;ummonned a congre&s;s of the &s;everal &s;tates of the other world. (1 Kings 22.19. I &s;aw the Lord &s;itting on his throne) and i&s;&s;uing out proclamation.&mdash;Be it known!

<PB N="65" REF="012626_0064_0F8B8F4EC76FE288">
to &s;atiate their own ambition (in&s;tead of advi&s;ing, and di|recting the churches in the &s;tudy of their con&s;titution; and &s;o plead their cau&s;e for them) they con&s;ult how to defraud them, they wre&s;t the &s;cripture, darken all places which &s;ettle their titles, and to end all di&s;putes threaten them Diotrephes like (3 <HI>Joh.</HI> 10.) with the &s;ecular power that is now on their &s;ide. That they have at la&s;t ab&s;olute|ly &s;upplanted them, &s;tript and taken away the rights be|longing to the churches, and purcha&s;ed at &s;o dear a rate. That as though the Almighty &s;hould &s;ay, my patience is out! And my ju&s;tice has prepared a cup of confu&s;ion for them; Who! of all this convocation will go and hand it to them? And there came forth &s;everal legions with an arch-devil at the head of them, and &s;tood before the Lord, and &s;aid, we will go and per&s;uade them; and God &s;aid, you &s;hall per&s;uade them, and prevail al&s;o; therefore go forth and do &s;o, 1 Kings 22.22. As though God &s;hould &s;ay, I have now in di&s;plea&s;ure abandoned them to ruin; they who &s;hould have had a zealous regard to my &s;ettlements and as one chief end of their mini&s;try, &s;hould have &s;ought the happine&s;s of the people, and not their own ea&s;e, vain glory, pride and luxury; now leave them expo&s;ed to obliterate the e&s;&s;entials of their faith, and &s;o fall a &s;acrifice to divine fury. Go you malignant powers do your wor&s;t, the hedges are now down.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;tance</HI> 2. The univer&s;al apo&s;tacy that has followed the &s;ubver&s;ion of the old con&s;titution. We may in &s;ome degree date Gods departure from his churches when they began to &s;ubvert the order of them, and &s;o gradually with|drew, till he&mdash;at la&s;t left them to peri&s;h by whole ages together. It mu&s;t not, indeed, be thought, or &s;aid, but that God had a remnant through many ages, who con|tinued orthodox in faith, both in the mini&s;try and brother|hood. But yet it is very obvious that chri&s;tianity <HI>Gradatim,</HI> declined till all was &s;wallowed up in a univer&s;al and direful apo&s;tacy, never &s;ufficiently to be deplored; neither fully expre&s;t, unle&s;s we tran&s;cribe the volumns that contain it. I do account indeed that the de&s;truction of the churches, in moral &s;peaking, may be attributed immediately and nextly to other cau&s;es, as ignorance, pride, hypocri&s;y, &amp;c. But remotely to the di&s;&s;olution of the order of them. For that the con&s;titution forenamed was adju&s;ted by divine

<P N="2">2. In the la&s;t century God has been very admirable in the works of providence, and has therein highly dignify|ed our con&s;titution. And we want no other evidence under this head than the recognition of what God has done for the&s;e famous Engli&s;h colonies in North-America; who have all along di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, from all the world, by their &s;ingular regard both to the faith and practice of the true religion. Now let any other con&s;titution on earth but parrallel ours; in the eminent &s;hines of providence and in religious effects, and we will re&s;ign the whole cau&s;e. But whil&s;t then, we will go on and rejoice in the grace of God, that we in the&s;e countries, are by his good providence over us, the &s;ubjects of the mo&s;t ancient, ratio|nal &amp; noble con&s;titution in church order that ever was, will be, or can be; whil&s;t the laws of nature and grace remain unrepeal'd. For that it is a con&s;titution which infinite wi&s;dom hath authorized and founded in the law of nature; and his omni&s;cient providence has eminently honored, and dignified, both by the &s;miles and frowns of his countenance, through all the ages of the chri&s;tian world to this very morning. And though &s;ome of the reverend churches within this grand con&s;ociation (who &s;ettled upon the &s;ame platform with us) have with two great a precipitation made a defection from the con&s;titution: Yet this is our comfort, that their alteration is not &s;o firm, as the laws of the Medes and Per&s;ians; for that tho&s;e who turned them off, may by the &s;ame power bring them on to their old ba&s;is again. And let Chri&s;t pity, and help them. For cer|tainly their pre&s;ent &s;tate is portentous, from what may be ob&s;erved from the proceedings of providence through the whole chri&s;tian Aera, unto this day.</P>

<HEAD>The Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude my whole e&s;&s;ay, by annexing the joint te&s;timony of tho&s;e eminent men, fathers in the&s;e churches, now in glory. viz. The reverend Mr. John
<PB N="67" REF="012626_0066_0F8B8F504CDBA810">
Higgin&s;on, and the reverend Mr. William Hubbard. And the rather becau&s;e Mr. Hubbard did &s;ome time before his death, de&s;ire to have their te&s;timony re-printed, and live with &s;ome other book which it might properly accompany. I am well &s;atisfied the foregoing &s;ubject is the mo&s;t proper companion, their te&s;timony could have light on, in its travels through the world: I therefore make bold to invite the &s;aid te&s;timony, to &s;et out again with fre&s;h courage, and improve its excellent language, toge|ther with former acceptance it found with the churches to ingratiate and be&s;peak favor for this &s;mall treati&s;e, its new allie and fellow-traveller.</P>
<P>And let the holy churches (for whom the&s;e now appear in joint te&s;timony to confirm their divine pedigree) flouri&s;h in their &s;trength, beauty and order, after this triumvirate &s;hall &s;ink under the tyranny of moths, and human forget|fulne&s;s, and lye down in the hou&s;e of oblivion; where I hope the enemies of the con&s;titution will be gotten down before them, and there fa&s;t buried in their own bones and du&s;t.</P>
<P>But lea&s;t any &s;hould think it ab&s;urd, that I here produce &s;uch venerable authority in way of epilogue, which &s;hould rather in honor have been placed in the front of this at|tempt. To this I reply, that in honor and prudence I chu&s;e here to place the&s;e worthies. For you mu&s;t note; I am now retreating out of the field of battle, and I hope upon honorable terms too; and then the reer is the highe&s;t place in dignity; &s;o that though they are bringers-up, its no diminution to them. And not only &s;o, but out of prudent conduct; for though I pre&s;ume the enemy is fairly van|qui&s;hed, yet &s;ome forlorn party may rally, and to gratify their de&s;perate fortune may di&s;turb us, but I hope the&s;e valiant and wi&s;e commanders thus po&s;ted, will &s;ecure our reer, beat back the enemy, and bring all off with tri|umph.</P>

<HEAD>A TESTIMONY To the <HI>order of the go&s;pel,</HI> in the churches of <HI>New-England:</HI> Left in the hands of the churches, by the two mo&s;t aged mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, yet &s;urviving in the country.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ABOVE &s;eventy years have pa&s;&s;ed away, &s;ince one of us, and above &s;ixty, &s;ince the other of us came into <HI>New-England, and hav|ing obtained help from God, we continue to this day.</HI></P>
<P>We are therefore capable to make &s;ome compari&s;on, between the condition of the churches, when they were fir&s;t erected in this country, and the condition into which they are now fallen, and more falling every day.</P>
<P>But we wi&s;h, that in making this compari&s;on, we had not cau&s;e to take the place, and the part of tho&s;e old men, that &s;aw the young men &s;houting aloud for joy, at the new temple, <HI>Ezra.</HI> 3.12. Ancient men that had &s;een the fir&s;t hou&s;e; when the foundation of this hou&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice.</P>
<P N="2">2. We are under a daily expectation of our call to ap|pear before our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and we have rea&s;on to be above all things concerned, that we may give up our account with joy unto him. That we may be the better able to do &s;o, we judge it nece&s;&s;ary for us to leave in the hands of the churches, a brief te&s;timony, to the cau&s;e of God and his people in this land. And this the rather, becau&s;e we are &s;en&s;ible that there is ri&s;en and ri&s;ing among us, a number who not only for&s;ake the right ways of the Lord, wherein the&s;e holy churches have walked, but al&s;o labour to carry away as many others with them as they can.</P>
<P>We are al&s;o informed, that many younger men of great worth, and hearty friends unto the church-&s;tate of the country, &s;carce know what interpretation to put upon it; but find it a &s;en&s;ible di&s;advantage unto them, that the elder men are &s;o &s;ilent, and remi&s;s upon the manife&s;t occa|&s;ions, that call aloud for us to open our mouth in the cau&s;e of churches that we &s;hould be loth to &s;ee led unto de&s;|truction.</P>
<P N="3">3. We that &s;aw the per&s;ons, who from four famous colo|nies,
<PB N="69" REF="012626_0068_0F8B8F52EAC96650">
a&s;&s;embled in the &s;ynod, that agreed on our platform of Church Di&s;cipline, cannot forget their excellent charac|ter. They were men of great renown in the nation, from whence the Laudian per&s;ecution exiled them; their learn|ing, their holine&s;s, their gravity, &s;truck all men that knew them with admiration. They were Timothies in their hou&s;es, Chry&s;o&s;tomes in their pulpits, Augu&s;tines in their di&s;putations. The prayers, the &s;tudies, the humble en|quiries, with which they &s;ought after the mind of God, were as likely to pro&s;per as any mens upon earth. And the &s;ufferings wherein they were confe&s;&s;ors for the name and the truth of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, add unto the argu|ments which would per&s;wade us, that our gracious Lord would reward and honor them, with communicating much of his truth unto them. The famous Brightman had fore|told, <HI>Clariorem lucem adhuc Solitudo dabit, &amp;c.</HI> God would yet reveal more of the true church-&s;tate unto &s;ome of his faithful &s;ervants, whom he would &s;end into a wilderne&s;s, that he might there have communion with them. And it was eminently accompli&s;hed in what was done for and by the men of God, that fir&s;t erected churches for him in this American wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>We do therefore in the fir&s;t place, earne&s;tly te&s;tify, That if any who are given to change, do ri&s;e up to unhinge the well e&s;tabli&s;hed churches in this land, it will be the duty and intere&s;t of the churches, to examine, whether the men of this tre&s;pa&s;s, are more prayerful, more watchful, more zealous, more patient, more heavenly, more univer&s;ally con&s;cientious, and harder &s;tudents, and better &s;cholars, and more willing to be informed and advi&s;ed, than tho&s;e great and good men, who left unto the churches what they now enjoy: If they be not &s;o, it will be wi&s;dom for the children to forbear pulling down with their own hands, the hou&s;es of God, which were built by their wi&s;er fathers, until they have better &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>It is not yet forgot by &s;ome &s;urviving ear-witne&s;&s;es of it, that when the Synod had fini&s;hed the Platform of Church Di&s;cipline, they did with an extraordinary eleva|tion of &s;oul and voice, then &s;ing together, the &s;ong of Mo&s;es the &s;ervant of God, and the &s;ong of the Lamb, in the fif|teenth chapter of the revelation: God forbid, that in the lo&s;s of that holy Di&s;cipline, there &s;hould be hereafter occa&s;ion to &s;ing about breaking down the carved work of
<PB N="70" REF="012626_0069_0F8B8F53E008D610">
the hou&s;es of God, with axes and hammers; or take up the eightieth p&s;alm for our lamentations.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was a joy unto us, to &s;ee and read, a book which the reverend pre&s;ident of our college lately publi&s;hed, un|der the tittle of 'The order of the go&s;pel profe&s;&s;ed and practi&s;ed by the churches of Chri&s;t in <HI>New-England</HI>:' A book mo&s;t highly needful, and u&s;eful, and &s;ea&s;onable; a mo&s;t elaborate and well compo&s;ed work, and well &s;uited unto tho&s;e two worthy de&s;igns; 1&s;t. the maintaining the congregational-church-di&s;cipline; and 2dly, the main|taining the &s;weet &s;pirit of charity and communion towards reforming pre&s;byterians, who are our united brethren. But we mu&s;t here withal te&s;tify, that in that worthy book, there is nothing obtruded upon the churches, but what they who were here, capable of ob&s;erving what was done &s;ixty years ago, do know to have been profe&s;&s;ed and prac|ti&s;ed in the churches of <HI>New-England</HI>; (except in one or two) then and ever &s;ince, until of late, &s;ome who were not then born, have &s;ugge&s;ted otherwi&s;e. Yea, tis well known, that the churches then publickly maintained tho&s;e princi|ples, in &s;everal judicious di&s;cour&s;es, which were never con|futed by any men whatever, unto this pre&s;ent time. And we do therefore mo&s;t heartily commend that book, of the order of the go&s;pel, unto the peru&s;al and acceptance of the churches of the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">5. It was one of the &s;ongs (as the jewi&s;h ma&s;ters tell us) in the &s;eat of the tabernacles, Ble&s;&s;ed be our youth, which have not made our old men a&s;hamed. But alas, we that are old men mu&s;t confe&s;s our&s;elves a&s;hamed, when we &s;ee after what manner &s;ome of our youth, have expre&s;&s;ed and behaved them&s;elves, and with what &s;coffs they have a&s;&s;ault|ed the order of the go&s;pel, in &s;ome things lately pub|li&s;hed, and &s;cattered about the country: which have been &s;o far from an&s;wering the arguments brought for our church order, that they have been by the wonderful pro|vidence of Chri&s;t, made u&s;eful to e&s;tabli&s;h the minds of &s;erious chri&s;tians, in tho&s;e very points, which they &s;ee &s;o weakly and &s;o rudely oppo&s;ed. We have taught our children in the catechi&s;m, called milk for babes, that there is to be a covenant of God in the churches, wherein they give up them&s;elves, fir&s;t unto the Lord to be his people, and then to the elders and brethren of the churches to &s;et forward the wor&s;hip of God, and mutual edification. And
<PB N="71" REF="012626_0070_0F8B8F540EC111B0">
it cannot but be grievous unto us, as well as unto all &s;eri|ous chri&s;tians, for my children of <HI>New-England,</HI> &s;corn|fully to vomit up their milk with &s;coffs upon that and other &s;acred actions in our churches, too horrible to be repeated.</P>
<P>If they take from us, one of the &s;ongs among the anci|ent Jews, they would however leave us room for one of the &s;ighs uttered by a rabbi among them; the wor&s;t fruit which we eat in our youth, excelled the be&s;t which we now eat in our old age, for in our days the world is changed.</P>
<P N="6">6. Concerning all &s;inful attempts to overturn the or|der of the go&s;pel, hitherto upheld in the churches of New-England, and to &s;poil that glorious work of God, which we have &s;een him doing, with a &s;eries of remarkable pro|vidences, in erecting &s;uch congregational churches in the&s;e ends of the earth; we would now therefore bear our te&s;timony, that they are doubtle&s;s di&s;plea&s;ing to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who walks in the mid&s;t of the&s;e golden can|dle&s;ticks, and they will prove bitterne&s;s in the latter end.</P>
<P>And this we declare with the more concern upon our minds, becau&s;e of an ob&s;ervation, &s;o plain, that he that runs may read it.</P>
<P>It is too ob&s;ervable, that the power of godline&s;s, is ex|ceedingly decaying and expiring in the country; and one great point in the decay of the power of godline&s;s, is men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> growing weary of the congregational church-di&s;cipline, which is evidently calculated to maintain it.</P>
<P>If that church-di&s;cipline were more thoroughly and vigorou&s;ly kept alive, even by tho&s;e that make profe&s;&s;ion of it, it might be hoped, that the Lord would &s;anctify it, for the revival of all godline&s;s in the land.</P>
<P>But if this church-di&s;cipline come to be given up, we think it our duty, to leave this warning with the churches, that probably the apo&s;tacy will not &s;top there: For the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame &s;pirit that will di&s;po&s;e the next generation to change their way, in one point, will di&s;po&s;e them to more, and more changes (even in doctrine and wor&s;hip as well as in manners) until it may be feared, the candle&s;tick will quickly be removed out of its place.</P>
<P N="7">7. We do therefore humbly propo&s;e it, unto all the churches, as a great expedient, for the pre&s;ervation of our church-&s;tate, that more prayer (even in whole days of pray|er
<PB N="72" REF="012626_0071_0F8B8F54C61EE8E8">
&s;et apart for that end) with other appointed means, may be u&s;ed in the churches to obtain from the Lord, the out pourings of the &s;pirit of grace on the ri&s;ing generation. If &s;o rich a ble&s;&s;ing were obtained, (and our heavenly fa|ther will give his holy &s;pirit unto them that a&s;k it) and if the ri&s;ing generation might be a praying, pious, devout and regenerate generation, there will not be &s;uch danger as now there is, of their ea&s;ily giving away the precious legacy which their fathers (now beholding the face of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in glory,) left unto them, or of their doting upon innovations fatal to the order of the go&s;pel among us.</P>
<P N="8">8. Now as aged Jo&s;eph &s;aid, I die, and God will &s;urely vi&s;it you: even &s;o, we the unworthy &s;ervants of the Lord, who&s;e age bids us every day look for death, and our call to that world, where to be is by far the be&s;t of all, do con|clude with our prayers unto the Lord for the&s;e holy churches, that he would &s;urely vi&s;it them, and grant much of his gracious pre&s;ence and &s;pirit in the mid&s;t of them; and rai&s;e up from time to time, tho&s;e who may be happy in|&s;truments of bringing down the hearts of the parents into the children. The Lord ble&s;s the&s;e his churches, and keep them &s;tedfa&s;t, both in the faith and in the order of the go&s;|pel, and be with them, as he was with their fathers, and never leave them nor for&s;ake them.</P>

<PB N="73" REF="012626_0072_0F8B8F5874D63EC0">
of church-di&s;cipline, publi&s;hed by a Synod in the year 1648, next unto the Bible, which was the profe&s;&s;ed, no perpetual, and only directory of the&s;e churches, they had platform of their church government, more exact than their famous John Cotton's well known book of the keys; which book, endeavors to lay out, the ju&s;t lines and bounds, of all church power, and &s;o defines the matter; that as in the &s;tate, there is a di&s;per&s;ion of powers into &s;everal hands, which are to concur into all acts of common con|cernment; from whence ari&s;es the healthy con&s;titution of a common-wealth: In like &s;ort, he a&s;&s;igns the powers in the church, unto &s;everal &s;ubjects, wherein the united light of &s;cripture, and of nature, have placed them with a very &s;atisfactory di&s;tribution.'</P>
<P>"He a&s;&s;erts, That a pre&s;byterated &s;ociety of the faith|ful, hath within it&s;elf, a compleat power of &s;elf-reforma|tion, or if you will, of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation; and may within it&s;elf, manage its own choices of officers, and cen&s;ures, of delinquents. Now a &s;pecial &s;tatute-law of our Lord, having excepted women and children, from enjoying any part of this power, he finds only elders and brethren to be the con&s;tituent members, who may act in &s;uch a &s;acred corporation; the elders he finds the fir&s;t &s;ubject entru&s;ted with government; the brethren endowed with privilege, in &s;o much that though the elders are to rule the church, and without them there can be no elections, admi&s;&s;ions, or excommunications, and they have a negative upon the acts of the fraternity, as well as 'tis they only that have the power of authoritative preaching and admini&s;tring the &s;acraments: Yet the brethren have &s;uch a liberty that without their con&s;ent, nothing of common concernment may be impo&s;ed upon them. Neverthele&s;s, becau&s;e parti|cular churches of elders and brethren may abu&s;e their powers, with manifold mi&s;carriages, he a&s;&s;erts the nece&s;|&s;ary communion of churches in Synods, who have authori|ty to determine, declare and enjoin, &s;uch things as may rectify the male-admini&s;trations, of any di&s;orders, di&s;&s;enti|ons and confu&s;ions of the congregations which fall un|der their cognizance. But &s;till &s;o as to leave unto the particular churches them&s;elves, the formal acts, which are to be done pur&s;uant unto the advice of the council; upon

This was the de&s;ign of that judi|cious treati&s;e, wherein was contained the &s;ub&s;tance of our church di&s;cipline; and whereof we have one remarkable thing to relate as we go along. That great per&s;on who afterwards proved one of the greate&s;t &s;cholars, divines and writers in this age, then under prejudices of conver&s;ation, &s;et him&s;elf to write a confutation of this very treati&s;e, of the keys; but having made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in his undertaking, &s;uch was the &s;trength of this unan&s;wera|ble book, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tead of confuting it, it conquered him; and this book of the keys, was happily &s;o ble&s;&s;ed of God for the conveyance of congregational principles into the now opened mind of this learned man, that he not only wrote in defence of Mr. Cotton, but al&s;o expo&s;ed him&s;elf to more than a little &s;orrow and labour all his days, for the maintaining of tho&s;e principles. Upon which occa&s;ion the words of the Doctor (Owen, in his review of the true nature of &s;chi&s;m) are, this way of impartial examining all things by the word, and laying a&s;ide all prejudicate re&s;pect unto per&s;ons, or pre&s;ent traditions, is a cour&s;e that I would admoni&s;h all to beware of, who would avoid the danger of being made (what they call) independants. Having &s;aid thus much, of that book, all that we &s;hall add con|cerning it, is, That the eminent Mr. Rutherford him|&s;elf, in his treati&s;e entitled, a &s;urvey of the &s;piritual anti|chri&s;t, has the&s;e words, Mr. Cotton in his treati&s;e of the keys of the kingdom of heaven, is well &s;ound in our way; if he had given &s;ome more power to a&s;&s;emblies, and in &s;ome le&s;&s;er points."</P>

<HEAD>THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY. To the Fraternity of the Churches in the <HI>New-England</HI> Colonies.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Truly honorable, and beloved in Chri&s;t,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not from any di&s;re&s;pect, or for want of honor to the reverend elder&s;hip and pa&s;tors of your &s;everal com|munities, that I apply my&s;elf more immediately and thus abruptly to your &s;elves in this dedication. But for that it &s;eems mo&s;t agreable with my pre&s;ent provence. The privileges of the fraternity being &s;o peculiarly the theme and &s;ubject of my pains, I e&s;teem it very proper to introduce my following e&s;&s;ays, with a few words of advice more directly to your&s;elves if you may be thence moved and encouraged to a&s;&s;i&s;t for the &s;upport of Chri&s;t's and your own intere&s;ts. I de&s;ire to be without offence to any, and pray that all &s;uch worthy per&s;ons, wi&s;e and faithful pa&s;tors in the&s;e churches (who are as much obliged by their office to &s;tand by and defend the e&s;tabli&s;hed intere&s;t and rights of them as I am, and far more capable) will interpret my whole action in the mo&s;t favorable &s;en&s;e. And tho' I have not with the noble <HI>Cortius</HI> leapt into a cha&s;m made in the forum; yet I have ventured to &s;tep into the gap, to keep the breach, till better hands come up, for the &s;ervice of

my country, and in defence of their &s;acred liberties; &s;o that I hope many of you will come in with a new &s;upply and recruit of courage and argument, when and where mine fails; and for the pre&s;ent I pre&s;ume none of you will be offended, tho' I do thus immediately addre&s;s the churches over which you pre&s;ide, with the following prin|ciples of their intere&s;t and duty wrapped up in each other.</P>
<P>Then, <HI>Honorable Brethren!</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. In general, my advice is to you, that in good or|der, and with all gracefulne&s;s which becomes wi&s;e men, you will with zeal, courage and faithfulne&s;s, &s;tand in the defence of, and maintain your church liberties; God certainly obliges you to do it, with all the di&s;cretion and bravery of &s;pirit, which becomes free men, in with&s;tand|ing va&s;&s;alage or a &s;ervile &s;tate, Gal. 5.1, 13. Stand fa&s;t therefore in the liberties, wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free, and be not intangled again with the yoke of bon|dage: The plea is as forcible again&s;t a chri&s;tian, as a Jewei&s;h Thraldom. For brethren, ye have been called unto liberty. I mu&s;t acknowledge I have no particular prejudice again&s;t any of the governments of chri&s;tian pro|te&s;tant churches in the world, &s;o as to defraud or di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s any of them of heaven; or monopolize &s;o great a royalty to our own; but yet I am of this opinion, con&s;idering the ju&s;t title of the crown, the churches, the people, the capa|city of &s;oil and climate together, that the con&s;titution and way of New-England churches cannot be mended by ex|change.</P>
<P>Briefly, To in&s;tance in the civil part, or intere&s;t of the crown, I think it very ea&s;y to evince, by the precepts both of religion and policy, that the parliament (that wi&s;e and augu&s;t council of the nation) could not have invented an e&s;tabli&s;hment in church order, more for the &s;ervice of the imperial crown of the Briti&s;h empire than our pre&s;ent con&s;titution, e&s;pecially in &s;uch a country and climate as this is.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not now any ways enter upon the que&s;tion, but only give ju&s;t a &s;hort hint as to the revenue. Our pre|&s;ent con&s;titution does indeed, &s;omewhat more than &s;ip; it takes an hone&s;t healthful draught at natures fountains, but leaves the flowing &s;treams for empire to &s;it at, till filled with &s;atiety.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="012626_0081_0F8B8F5FB4A6A728">The eccle&s;ia&s;ticks in &s;ome kingdoms in Europe are ready not only to chide with crowned heads, but to take them by the throat, and wring out of their hands, if not almo&s;t a moiety, yet a va&s;t &s;hare of the golden fleeces that &s;hould &s;upply the public trea&s;uries, and cloath the nakedne&s;s of the kingdoms, and the people have no more wit but to ju&s;tify and defend them in their claims and oppre&s;&s;ions, and that till they them&s;elves (in great numbers) are as thin and ragged as penury it&s;elf; for by their rules of adju&s;tment, when the church hath gotten an uncon&s;ciona|ble &s;hare, then the crown or &s;ubject mu&s;t be almo&s;t &s;tarved; for there is not left a &s;ufficient and plentiful &s;upply for both.</P>
<P>But now our New-England con&s;titution is very fair-mannered; for when its &s;its down to the &s;talled ox (made ready) it carves temperately and (without much defacing) leaves the whole to the empire to make its armies and navies, with the re&s;t of its needful and unwearied &s;ervants welcome. That in loyalty to your prince, and for the &s;upport of the royal revenue, you may ju&s;tly pre&s;erve your freedoms.</P>
<P>Let us al&s;o con&s;ider the be&s;t good of a whole people.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain, true grace is the one thing needful, and the main concern for the improvement of the powers both of prince, noble and pea&s;ant, and tho' grace be of that nature that it will grow (after a fa&s;hion and in &s;ome &s;ort of &s;oil) almo&s;t under any government; yet it is mo&s;t agreable with laws of piety and wi&s;dom (for the good of all in general) to chu&s;e and &s;ecure that con&s;titution and form of government that is mo&s;t agreable, and which mo&s;t naturally breeds it, and in greate&s;t plenty.</P>
<P>By the &s;uffrage of our nation, that government which &s;en&s;ibly clogs tyranny, and pre&s;erves the &s;ubject free from &s;lavery, under the ambition of men of great fortune and tru&s;t, is the only government in the &s;tate to advance mens temporal happine&s;s; and we in this country honor the re&s;olve in civil affairs, and al&s;o affirm (upon great expe|rience) that &s;uch a con&s;titution in church government is (al&s;o) the only way to advance grace and mans eternal happine&s;s; and we are the more ratifyed in our opinion, for that the experiment has on the other hand been tried, with a witne&s;s, in almo&s;t all kingdoms of the chri&s;tian world, and that fir&s;t, by di&s;&s;ei&s;ing the fraternity of all in|tere&s;t
<PB N="83" REF="012626_0082_0F8B8F602BF4D2A8">
in church government, only they have had the liberty to be governed with a hook in their noi&s;e (like wild cat|tle in a &s;tring) by the mercy and plea&s;ures of their drivers; but as for any &s;hare in the exerci&s;e of government, they have had no more, than the hor&s;es in the royal &s;tables, for that their &s;piritual owners having &s;eized all the keys of church power, they profe&s;s no dividend &s;hall be made, and al&s;o they them&s;elves being uncontrolable by any, and un|accountable to any, unle&s;s it be to Chri&s;t him&s;elf, as they pretend: Though I believe, thou&s;ands of them never ex|pect to meet with him, nor think that he ever will audit any accompts of theirs.</P>
<P>But however, for the comfort and glory of the pre&s;ent life, the whole government of the &s;piritual kingdom, in all its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> inches, and with its immen&s;e profits, has been e&s;tab|li&s;hed theirs.

<P>And mu&s;t the waves and pre&s;ent currents &s;it and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ft the&s;e churches, towards tho&s;e rocks and &s;hipwrecks, whil&s;t we have &s;uch good hands and pilots an board? God for|bid!</P>
<P>Therefore let the&s;e churches and the noble fraternity of them, &s;tand their ground, keep fa&s;t hold of what you have got, Rev. 3.11. Hold that fa&s;t which thou ha&s;t, that no man take thy crown.</P>
<P>Hold your hold brethren! <HI>Et validis incumbite Remis,</HI> pull up well upon your oars, you have a rich cargo, and I hope we &s;hall e&s;cape &s;hipwreck; for according to the late&s;t ob&s;ervation, if we are not within &s;ight, yet we are not far from harbour; and though the noi&s;e of great breakers which we hear, imports hazard, yet I hope day-light, and good piloting will &s;ecure all.</P>
<P>More particularly I a&s;k your patience with liberty (&s;till for your &s;ervice) to make the few following di&s;tinct peti|tions.</P>

<P>I &s;hall therefore at pre&s;ent only ju&s;t indix the principal titles or heads for an&s;wer, by pointing briefly at the duties of officers, and the prerogatives of the churches in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is mo&s;t apparent through the whole mini&s;try of the world (unle&s;s in ab&s;olute monarchies) that it is the duty of all public officers, to mini&s;ter according to the plain rules of the public &s;tate, and not by their own fancy or wills, and &s;o in this ca&s;e, the chief ruling officer or officers (then in being) in point of conduct are obliged to lead the church in their opperation, according to the churches plain and &s;ettled principles, and not reluct be|cau&s;e their own per&s;wa&s;ions do otherwi&s;e incline them; It is now plainly too late for any officer to pretend con&s;cience again&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed rules: This objection &s;hould have been made before they had taken office. But now it is out of &s;ea&s;on, for they were elected and ordained to govern the church, not by their own thoughts, as the rule, but by the churches canon, and that by their own con&s;ent, when they took office. And moreover, this is mo&s;t evident, that if &s;uch powers which belong to the in&s;ide of mens being, viz. their hearts, fancies, notions, judgments, imagina|tions or con&s;ciences, call them by what names you plea&s;e, or let the owners freely fix the titles (the odds is not great,) now if the&s;e are to be the rule of churches, then pa&s;tors and ruling officers have (in their degree) as ab&s;o|lute a dominion over the churches, as the great Turk has over his ba&s;haws, and other va&s;&s;als.</P>
<P>But I hope none here will claim this dominion. And if not, then let pa&s;tors and teachers do their duty in point of conduct (if the churches are not remi&s;s in theirs) and this great vacancy may be &s;oon &s;upplied, and there is al&s;o a relief for officers, if their ju&s;t prerogatives are any ways toucht by the traver&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, To confine the di&s;cour&s;e to this pre&s;ent example, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;horten terms, for brevity's &s;ake, it mu&s;t be granted that any particular officer &s;en&s;ible of his duty, that &s;hall undertake to gratify and lead the church, in the election
<PB N="91" REF="012626_0090_0F8B8F6A9C410458">
and choice, &amp;c. This makes the ca&s;e very ea&s;y in point of conduct; yea, tho' other officers in the &s;ame church, if there be any, &s;hould either oppo&s;e or not act. For that any one ruling officer in a church, where they may be many of the &s;ame nature, he him&s;elf is vertually the whole college of officers in any office-act that he performs with|out them. As in civil affairs, a particular executor &s;o far &s;u&s;tains the whole executor&s;hip, as that he can make a va|lid act in that mini&s;try, though many others are joined with him in the &s;ame te&s;tament, and yet don't nor won't act with him, in this or that affair, tho' confirmed in their tru&s;t; which principal is founded in the nature of a joint tenancy in general, and in a joint tru&s;t in particular, held by many equals.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, The ca&s;e is very difficult when the &s;tanding officers join as one man, and will not guide the church in the&s;e elections referred to, &amp;c. And I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, I fear here has been the great bar to this office.</P>
<P>We may from intere&s;t, as well as duty, rationally &s;up|po&s;e the inclinations of the churches, and the de&s;ires of many of them have been made known by repeated and honorable &s;olicitations therein, &s;aying to Archipus, fulfil thy mini&s;try, Cor. 4.17. And we may al&s;o affirm, the principle is plain, the office is acknowledged, at home and abroad to be of divine original. But however this is cer|tain it is a formal e&s;tabli&s;hment by the&s;e churches, and not now to be di&s;puted. Yet the officers pretend, they &s;ee no rea&s;on to give way to the churches de&s;ire or demands, neither will they conduct in this ca&s;e, though their duty does oblige, that &s;o the church may be compleated in its officers; no! they are plea&s;ed by acts of a &s;uperintending power, to lock the church door, and turn the key again&s;t this office, and no pleas or per&s;wa&s;ions can alter their re&s;o|lutions. But hereby the officers do plainly abdicate their office, by changing the acts of a limited tru&s;t, bounded by precept into what is meerly arbitrary; &s;o in a degree, they break up the relation between them&s;elves and the church, and by &s;uch an e&s;&s;ential error, &s;o contrary to the churches charter, and their own commi&s;&s;ion they forfeit all at once, tho' lenity and mercy may favor them with a long life; yet in the eye of ju&s;tice they are dead men, if not in na|ture, yet in law, and upon their OBSTINACY may ju&s;tly be DEGRADED, therefore in &s;uch a ca&s;e when it comes to

<P>Whether the churches in New-England are not fairly in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a form of government, by which they are di&s;|tingui&s;hed from mo&s;t of the reformed churches in the world, more than by their grace? and if &s;o, (which no man that knows them will deny,) then it mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;uperior power, or their own voluntary act, regularly ob|tained, that mu&s;t out or di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them.

<P>Whether length of time has di&s;covered any e&s;&s;ential error in the government of the&s;e churches?</P>
<P>And 1&s;t, it has, or 2dly, it has not.</P>
<P N="1">1. If time has made any &s;uch di&s;covery, yet the propo&s;als have not been &s;o fair as to detect it, or de&s;cribe wherein, or in what re&s;pect. The great &s;ervice the&s;e churches, with their government, have done, in &s;ubduing and beautifying a wilderne&s;s, be&s;peaks &s;ome con&s;iderable re&s;pect from all men, who value wi&s;dom or piety; that it mu&s;t needs &s;eem a har&s;h piece of ju&s;tice, without any formal trial for them to be driven from plenty, and &s;ent to the doors of their own tenants, to beg for a booty, out of that e&s;tate which was once their own at lea&s;t, by a &s;ei&s;in in fact, if not in law; for that the propo&s;als kill, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion with far le&s;s ceremony or legal formalities, than Ahab did, in gaining the right of Naboth's vineyard; when as if there is any e&s;&s;ential error in their frame or con&s;titution, and that they have either ignorantly or treacherou&s;ly a&s;&s;umed any peculiar prerogative which be+longs

to Chri&s;t's throne, as king, that was never their due to po&s;&s;e&s;s (and &s;o being con&s;idered as u&s;urpers, are dead in law) yet notwith&s;tanding it would not have offended again&s;t the laws of gratitude in &s;ending them to their graves, to have put &s;ome more marks of honor upon them, by certain &s;olemn and u&s;ual forms of trial in the prologue of their di&s;&s;olution; for they have been certainly great and good &s;ervants to the public, that if they de&s;erve to die, they ought to die under all the marks of honor which ju&s;tice can allow of, at the lea&s;t a grand &s;e&s;&s;ions, a jury, and liberty to make plea in their own defence, and under the influence of royal council, &s;hould have been granted; unle&s;s they may be treated as conquerors, &s;erve unfortu|nate pirates, who when taken, are without form of law hung up at the yards-arm.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. But if no &s;uch di&s;covery can be made, whether it is a wi&s;e and ju&s;t thing for men to alter their government? The churches of Chri&s;t in this country, have been in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of this form of government; and it hath been e&s;tabli&s;hed by certain legal and orderly familiarities, and univer&s;al con&s;ent; and has continued upwards of three|&s;core years. And as the poet &s;ays, <HI>Pervarios Ca&s;us Per Tot Di&s;crimina Rarum Tendimus in Caelum,</HI> They have pa&s;&s;ed various changes, and great temptations, and yet to this day by this be&s;ome of di&s;cipline have been kept as clean &s;wept, as any churches of God in the world; and any &s;uch embroilments as have lately happened in the churches, have been more the folly of admini&s;trators, in not keeping to the rules of government, than from any defect in the con&s;titution. Then what rea&s;on have we to meditate a change? No, certainly; it will be more divine and agreable with the law of our religious gratitude, to join with the rev. Mr. Nicholas Noy&s;e, in his doxology, or u&s;e of triumph and prai&s;e for the great mercies he recites in his election &s;ermon, p. 79. &s;ays he, Thanks be to God and the king! our hou&s;es and our lands are our own, without every mans being at the co&s;t of a charter; and yet we have the liberty of our religion, and the free exerci&s;e of it, without &s;ub&s;cribing new articles of faith, wor&s;hip or di&s;cipline; which is a great favor of God, if we have wi&s;dom and grace to improve it rightly.</P>

<HEAD>3d Query.</HEAD>
<P>Whether it be not great boldne&s;s for any particular gentlemen to invade, null, alter or weaken &s;o great a right and property, as is the government of the&s;e churches, with|out their con&s;ent?</P>
<P>Government is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing in the world, of a worldly nature; it is felony, cheaper by far to the loo&s;ers, to plunder men of their e&s;tate and wealth, nay, and of their lives too, then to di&s;poil them of government; for by the latter, you harra&s;s and worry them in the world, with plagues and mi&s;eries, wor&s;e than death it&s;elf, that the ba&s;e&s;t is far better than no government; a churli&s;h tyran|ny, is better than an in&s;olent anarchy, where men are without law, and all hail fellows, not well but badly met. And for men to alter or &s;wap government, without all in|tere&s;ted parties are agreed, is a very bold intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>That, yea, that government which is in any good mea|&s;ure formed, and does agree with the natural freedom of human beings, and is adju&s;ted by the laws of wi&s;dom and honor, and plainly, and fairly e&s;tabli&s;hed; is too much of God in the world, and too great a royalty belonging to men, for any to play the knave or fool with.</P>
<P>And when a government hath done all things in the main well, and has reapt in a great &s;tock of ble&s;&s;ings, now to &s;huffle it out of place, is ficklene&s;s, and not policy; for a &s;en&s;ible &s;eries of ble&s;&s;ings will always atone for &s;ome &s;eeming defects in a con&s;titution. Therefore when all I&s;rael met at Ramah, in a general a&s;&s;embly, to alter their con&s;ular government, which had been crowned with &s;ignal ble&s;&s;ings, they got ill will in the court of heaven for it, 1 Sam. 8.7.</P>
<P>The great &s;ucce&s;s which attended, &s;ignified it to be a theocracy, and that it had more of God, than of man in it, which is an argument, <HI>(Caeteris Paribus)</HI> for all other governments, and &s;o for this of New-England churches, which has been honored with great &s;ucce&s;s, and many

ble&s;&s;ings from its beginnings to this day; therefore well does Mr. Cotton Mather de&s;cribe the &s;ubject and advi&s;e his country, in his late &s;ermon on the &s;treet of gold, &s;ays he, (in a remarkable pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;age out of a letter) page 40.

<P>Whether by comparing the propo&s;als and our platform, we don't find them repugnant, and &s;o contradictory, that if one &s;tands, the other mu&s;t fall?</P>
<P>And that we can as &s;oon reconcile a republic with an ab&s;olute monarchy, or the be&s;t &s;ort of free &s;tates with a politic tyranny, or at lea&s;t with an oligarchy, where the chief end of government is the inriching and greatne&s;s of its mini&s;ters; and this we may do, when we have com|pounded the&s;e propo&s;als and our platform, &s;o that as that faithful and noble friend to the&s;e churches, the famous and learned Increa&s;e Mather, D.

We may here ju&s;tly highten the complaint, and cry, <HI>Pro Dolor! hinc Lachrimae!</HI> Alas, alas! here's the grief! hence flows our tears! for here is a bold attempt indeed, not only to de&s;poil the hou&s;e of &s;ome particular piece of furniture, but to throw it quite out at windows; not only to take away &s;ome of its ornaments, but to blow up its foundations. For the&s;e bold attempts which that WORTHY complains of, &s;eem now to be grown very ram|pant; for here is in view a combination of workmen di&s;affected with the fa&s;hion of the old fabrick, who (in pre|tence) de&s;ign to repair, but in reality to ruin the whole frame. They appear (indeed) &s;omething in the manner of Nehemiah's men on the wall, Neh. 4.17. As it were with a trowel in one hand, with which they now and then put on a little untempered mortar, to plai&s;ter over a think or two, where the old work by length of time, is

<P>We mu&s;t needs then enquire, from whence the propo&s;als derive their force? Who gives them letters of attorney, or commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ue the&s;e churches (by a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI>) out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their government? To me (I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s) the attempt is very daring; and I &s;ee no way of reconciliation, unle&s;s the &s;cheme drawn in the propo&s;als can be fairly &s;heltered under &s;ome more authentic and &s;pe|cious umbrage, than the bold dictates, tho' of the wi&s;e&s;t of men, when they are plea&s;ed to &s;et them&s;elves up oracles for their country.</P>
<P>So I come,</P>
<P N="2">2. To the more critical examination of the propo&s;als them&s;elves, which I &s;hall attend,</P>
<P N="1">1. More generally.</P>
<P N="2">2. More particularly, by taking a &s;urvey of them in their di&s;tinct &s;ections.</P>
<P N="1">1. More generally, by enquiring into their original, and nature.</P>
<P N="1">1. By making a more exact inque&s;t and &s;earch after their original; and in this debate, they forfeit their e&s;&s;ence, unle&s;s they can derive their pedigree, either,</P>
<P N="1">1. From Gods immediate in&s;piration. Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. From ancient revelation. Or,</P>
<P N="3">3. From right rea&s;on, which is a ray of divine wi&s;dom, in&s;tampt upon human nature. Or,</P>
<P N="4">4. From the platform of the churches, which is a &s;y&s;tem of government, collected by our ance&s;tors out of &s;everal fountains, and principally from the &s;criptures. Now in pur&s;uing this di&s;tribution, I &s;hall diligently enquire, whe|ther we can hear of their original under any of the&s;e heads.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="102" REF="012626_0101_0F8B8E611D1DD798">1. As to immediate in&s;piration, I mu&s;t needs pre&s;ume, the&s;e gentlemen will not dare to a&s;&s;ert, that they are &s;ent immediately from God with this me&s;&s;age to the churches; they are too good and wi&s;e to pretend (with enthu&s;ia&s;ts) to immediate vi&s;ion, or a &s;pirit of prophecy; both the mat|ter and manner of their writing, &s;ufficiently convinces, that the&s;e propo&s;als are their own &s;entiments; they dur&s;t not put, a, Thus &s;aith the Lord upon them; &s;uch an in&s;crip|tion is too heavenly and royal for &s;uch coin; for both they and we know, according to, Deut. 30.12. It is not in heaven, that thou &s;houlde&s;t &s;ay, who &s;hall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may know it, and do it? There is no need to &s;end me&s;&s;engers to that court, to learn by immediate and extraordinary information, ei|ther laws of our duty or intere&s;t; for that God hath made all things &s;ufficiently plain, by this time of day, either by &s;cripture or rea&s;on, for the conduct and government of his churches; yea, of the &s;ubjects of his univer&s;al intellectual monarchy in this world.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to ancient revelation; holy &s;cripture, that be&s;t, tho' not the bigge&s;t of books, is the &s;aint's library, and the clergy-man's pandects, whence he takes the rules for the management of his tru&s;t: &s;o that it is very amu&s;ing, that the bible &s;hould be forgotten in drawing up &s;uch &s;chemes as the&s;e; as, tho' the u&s;uage of the pope's conclave, which turns the bible out of doors for a wrangler, and gives the chief &s;eat to tradition, &amp;c. were here in fa&s;hion. Indeed, I cannot but e&s;teem them very unfortunate propo&s;als, to be turned &s;o naked into the world, as not to have the lea&s;t tincture of &s;cripture to guard them from contempt; no, not &s;o much as a citation, that might admit of &s;o much as a &s;trained con&s;equence in their defence. And &s;o, tho' le&s;s prophane, yet they are al&s;o le&s;s politic than the mo&s;t de&s;|perate of hereticks, who always bring their errors on the &s;tage, guarded with &s;criptures, and craftily endeavour to make their citations look with &s;uch an a&s;pect, as tho' they were encampt on their &s;ide. But here we have nothing for our faith to lean on, but &s;o many au&s;terer <HI>Ip&s;e Dixits,</HI> as bitter pills of dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h for the churches to &s;wallow, with|out any of the confection of heaven, or the &s;weet manna &s;prinkled upon them; or el&s;e only &s;o many naked human pre&s;umptions, as arrows or bolts, too ra&s;hly &s;hot out again&s;t the &s;ides of our churches, and no word of &s;cripture
<PB N="103" REF="012626_0102_0F8B8E61F0F595A8">
to tip or feather them. Nay, it is very memorable, and I account fatal, and to be ob&s;erved that God, that &s;acred title of the almighty, with which the holy &s;cripture does &s;o abound, is not once named (as I can find) in the whole treati&s;e; as tho' the mo&s;t &s;acred titles, as well as &s;ections of that heavenly book, would move fears, and irritate jealou&s;ies, rather than pour down &s;olace and comfort upon this undertaking. Therefore, in a word, the whole bible is thrown by as a &s;ealed parchment, or as one that never prophecies good to &s;uch adventurers. Therefore the&s;e propo&s;als being apprehended as &s;ea rovers, and indicted upon the &s;tatute of piracy; and upon examination being found without the prince of princes colours, and yet do|ing great mi&s;chief, in a&s;&s;aulting and wounding his churches and lawful &s;ubjects, on their hone&s;t occa&s;ion; being bound on a voyage to their own country, they can no ways in ju&s;tice e&s;cape, but mu&s;t pa&s;s under the &s;entence, and en|dure the pains of death, for they are taken fighting with|out commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>3. As to REASON.</P>
<P><HI>Recta Ratio,</HI> Right rea&s;on, that great oracle in human affairs, is the &s;oul of man &s;o formed and endowed by crea|tion, with a certain &s;agacity or acumen (in many particu|lar examples, &s;harpened by the con&s;titution of nature by grace and &s;tudy) whereby mans intellect is enabled to take up (<HI>pro Medulo,</HI> or in a degree) the true idea or preception things agreable with, and according to their natures. So that if we bring the&s;e propo&s;als under examination by the laws of rea&s;on; we mu&s;t enquire, whether they are agrea|ble with the nature and con&s;titution of the churches, if they fully harmonize with their principles of e&s;&s;ence, then they may be enroled for canons; but if they jar, and are plainly repugnant, we may then lawfully cen&s;ure them, and pronounce them irrational. Whether the&s;e churches are con&s;tituted by &s;cripture or rea&s;on, yea or no, that is not our que&s;tion, but being of &s;uch a frame or con&s;titution, as they now are, and always have been; all who pretend to &s;upport and pre&s;erve them, and yet take &s;uch mea&s;ures, as will utterly overthrow and di&s;&s;olve them, &s;uch repairers have apparently de&s;erted the dictates and government of right rea&s;on.</P>
<P>And here we may collect an induction of &s;ome few hints of certain particulars for evidence; the platform a&s;&s;erts a
<PB N="104" REF="012626_0103_0F8B8E628F5D8478">
cla&s;&s;es to be no go&s;pel form of church order; the propo&s;als &s;ay it is; or they abu&s;e our credulity. The propo&s;als or|ders the a&s;&s;ociation to have the fir&s;t cognizance of church ca&s;es; our government &s;ays, no, it belongs to the juri&s;|diction of particular churches. The propo&s;als gives power to the a&s;&s;ociation to have the fir&s;t cognizance of church ca&s;es; our government &s;ays, no, it belongs to the juri&s;|diction of particular churches. The propo&s;als gives power to the a&s;&s;ociation to limit elections, and to direct them; but our government &s;ays, no, it will not con&s;ent; the elec|tion of officers is the prerogative of the churches, and they wont, as yet, part with it, &amp;c. So that when we can by the rules of grammar, re&s;olve yea and nay, to be the &s;ame voice and word, then you may reconcile the propo&s;als and the platform; that certainly whatever there be of religion, the method is apparently di&s;agreable with common rea&s;on.</P>
<P>4. As to the PLATFORM.</P>
<P>I &s;hall repre&s;ent it by a kind of a &s;hort pro&s;opopa, thus, viz. enquiring whether the propo&s;als are reduced from this fountain, the platform with all its chapters, and with one joint con&s;ent, as plain as the tongue in their heads can utter it, &s;ay, that ever &s;ince it po&s;&s;e&s;t the government, &s;o much as dream'd of them. It may &s;ay with de&s;truction, (Job 28.22.) we have heard of the fame of the&s;e things, with our ears, but never imagined &s;o much as a &s;eminal virtue in our own being, for their procreation; but rather &s;tarts with the news of their approach, out of fear of its own di&s;&s;olution, from their repugnant and formidable na|ture. Therefore as in a grievous fright from &s;urprize, cries out with <HI>Athaliah,</HI> trea&s;on, trea&s;on! And begs that zeal and con&s;cience, tho&s;e two &s;ollicitors for the crown, will at this grand court of Oyer and Terminer, implead and pro|&s;ecute them as traitors to the prince of peace, and felons to the&s;e churches, Chri&s;t's loyal &s;ubjects. So I come,</P>
<P N="2">2. To enquire into the nature of the&s;e propo&s;als, by &s;urveying their compo&s;ition and properties.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Their compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>They &s;eem a conjunction of almo&s;t all the church govern|ments in the world, and the lea&s;t part is congregational.

<P N="1">1&s;t Property, is Di&s;order. Order is both the beauty and &s;afety of the univer&s;e; take away the decorum where|by the whole hangs together, the great frame of nature is unpin'd, and drops piece from piece; and out of a beauti|ful &s;tructure we have a chaos. The&s;e propo&s;als are there|fore very mi&s;chievous, if not in matter, yet in the manner of production; they are full of di&s;order, being things born out of due time, their conception is without counte|nance, from the rule of order. Indeed, there is no &s;tatute to be found that will ju&s;tify the fir&s;t coitus of the parents, neither will any allow their &s;ocial life; that the birth mu&s;t bear the attender, of being both begotten and born, out of lawful wedlock, and &s;o in point of honor fall under the cen&s;ure of the Levitical law, and mu&s;t be kept back from promotion; for, Deut. 32. "A ba&s;tard &s;hall not enter into the congregation."</P>
<P>That to pa&s;s all other remarks, if we are under mi&s;take in the a&s;&s;ertions; I then demand and enquire, where is that lawful authority, which publi&s;hed legal banes, with the con&s;ent of all the intere&s;ted per&s;ons, and the regular con&s;ummation of the match? If any rule can be found to &s;helter and honor the conception and birth, let it be pro|duced; and it e&s;caping other felonies with life, this &s;candal &s;hall be taken off, but otherwi&s;e it mu&s;t remain as a bar to the tenth generation.</P>
<P>The 2d Property, is U&s;urpation. The propo&s;als ap|parently u&s;urp the church prerogatives. It has been a&s;&s;ert|ed, and it is true, the&s;e churches have been &s;ettled upon the platform of their own government for upwards of &s;ixty years; they have often revi&s;ed and re-inforc'd the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, both as the principles of their con&s;ociation and union in general, and the form of government, for every church in particular.&mdash;Then for the&s;e propo&s;als without licence to a&s;&s;ume a legi&s;lation, and form a government &s;o repugnant to their own, can be no le&s;s than u&s;urping a dominion over them, contrary to the rule, 1.

out all the enobling royalties, liberties and enfranchize|ments in it, and &s;acrifice them to their own ambition! It is enough to put mankind into an uproar.</P>
<P>It is fre&s;h in memory, that when &s;ome of our Engli&s;h princes (and one would think, if any men may, they may be allowed to a&s;pire, yet when they) have pre&s;umed on le&s;s things than the&s;e propo&s;als reach after, in gratifying their aim at an ab&s;olute monarchy, when as they have not dared to lay out with &s;uch freedom, a new form of govern|ment, with a wide mouth, gaping to devour the Engli&s;h liberties, (as the&s;e propo&s;als do the churches,) but only with much &s;ecrecy, covin and policy, they have by &s;ome more clande&s;tine mea&s;ures, been intruding upon the anci|ent liberties of the Engli&s;h nation. Every one knows what direful convul&s;ions this has bred in the bowels of the kingdom. And may it not &s;erve to enliven this plea? To invite all &s;uch who are with <HI>Plato,</HI> owners of a great genius at inventing new, or modelling old government, to try their &s;kill in altering the Engli&s;h monarchy, and &s;ee how it will be probated. That is, &s;uppo&s;e you &s;hould ven|ture to interdict the royal a&s;&s;ent, or convert the pre&s;ent monarch into a duke of <HI>Venice,</HI> or di&s;&s;olve the lords in parliament or (rather in harmony with this &s;cheme) turn the burge&s;&s;es and knights of the &s;hires (as a &s;ort of men not fit for politics in parliament) out of doors? And whe|ther our &s;overeign, the peerage, or &s;ubjects of Engli&s;h li|berties would take it well? And whether chri&s;tian men may make bolder with the e&s;tabli&s;hed government of Chri&s;t's churches, than with that which belongs to civil affairs? In honor to the <HI>New-England</HI> churches, and with venera|tion for the Engli&s;h monarchy, I dare a&s;&s;ert, that there is in the con&s;titution of our church government, more of the Engli&s;h civil government in it, and it has a better com|plexion to &s;uit the true Engli&s;h &s;pirit, than is in the En|gli&s;h church, or any other, both as to the legi&s;lative and executive part of government. Indeed, con&s;idering how things are at home in church and &s;tate, I have been &s;ome|times ready to query, why the nation &s;hould be &s;o ena|moured with their civil, and yet &s;o carele&s;s and regardle&s;s of their go&s;pel liberties, &s;o as to tru&s;t their con&s;ciences, with their clergy, more immediately, and yet wont venture their e&s;tates with their learned judges, without the privi|lege and mediation of juries; as though they were more

careful and wi&s;e in &s;ecuring their e&s;tates than their &s;ouls, and valued one far more than the other. But I &s;hall go on with the compari&s;on.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the legi&s;lation; our <HI>New-England</HI> convocati|on admits, and the government does profe&s;s the fraternity as nece&s;&s;ary to the being of all &s;ynodical a&s;&s;emblies, that as far as legi&s;lation &s;piritual, is left to men, and as they have a great trea&s;ure, viz. their &s;alvation embarked, &s;o they have a great intere&s;t in the management of it; and herein they agree with the Engli&s;h caution and wi&s;dom, in the modes of civil government of the empire; for the com|mons are one great e&s;tate in the civil legi&s;lation; and they have a great power in the management of that great tru&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to admini&s;tration, or the executive part of go|vernment, our <HI>New-England</HI> government grants a juridical power to the frat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ity, and makes them proper judges in all eccle&s;ia&s;tical ca&s;es and admini&s;trations, on per&s;ons cog|nizable, or that mu&s;t pa&s;s a trial juridice; which is agrea|ble with the con&s;titution, nature and practice of the civil government of the empire; for under the pro&s;ecutions of law, no Engli&s;h &s;ubject in life, limb or e&s;tate, mu&s;t be pa&s;t upon, but by the judgment of his PEERS; yea, in all pleas of the crown, &s;uch confidence has the government put in the loyalty and di&s;cretion of the commons, that our Engli&s;h juries are &s;tated arbitrators, and umpires between our prince and his &s;ubjects. Yea &s;uch a dependance has the whole nation in keeping the&s;e liberties in their own hands, that they reckon the commons in parliament, and juries in the common wealth, to be the great pillars of En|gli&s;h honor and liberties, and they e&s;teem them as ram|parts built by the wi&s;dom of our ance&s;tors to defend us from tyranny and &s;lavery.</P>
<P>That con&s;idering the affinity in the&s;e two con&s;titutions, one would be ready to query, whether the heroic true En|gli&s;h &s;pirit is not parent to both? Or whether they are not equal debtors to the go&s;pel, for their original? The improvement of this compari&s;on is briefly this; &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome of the great mini&s;ters of &s;tate &s;hould venture to &s;weep away all tho&s;e civil enfranchizements which are En|gli&s;h-mens birth-right, and &s;et up an arbitrary power, with a prete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e of doing ju&s;tice and judgment in the king|dom, by more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and expedite mea&s;ures, whether they might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;eized?

<P N="3">3d Property, Riotous.

In managing this plea, I &s;hall only de&s;ire that the illegality of the a&s;&s;embly which formed the&s;e propo&s;als, with the ob|jects and things they intend, and the ancient boundaries which they plainly invade, together with the fearful ap|prehen&s;ions that many good and &s;ober people in the vici|nage have concerning the enterprize, may be critically examined; and I doubt not but when we obtain the &s;uff|rage of this honorable court, it will determine, the implead|ed criminals are of a riotous nature, and &s;o the indictment will &s;tand more valid again&s;t them.</P>

<P N="1">1.

and daring way to work, Simon and Levi had not been half a breakfa&s;t for the Hivites. Gen. 34.25.</P>
<P>So here, had the churches been convened, and no noi&s;e made of this de&s;ign, they po&s;&s;ibly (tho' their trea&s;ures are fortified by right, and &s;o in &s;afety, and their troops more, ten to one, than their enemies) yet by ambu&s;hments or &s;ur|prize, they might have chanced to have been coakered or conquered out of all, by being flattered, over-awed, or o|ver-argued, into a &s;urrender or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but we may now rationally hope the alarm will rouze the whole camp, and each &s;quadron will rebound it to the next with a <HI>hinc Proximas Urit Ucalogon</HI>; and &s;o the plot may upon a de|feat, blame its own bad conduct, more than its fortune.</P>
<P N="2">2. The de&s;ign it&s;elf (<HI>Quo ad fluem Executionis</HI>) let it come to birth, as is de&s;igned or de&s;ired, and the very hea|vens would either frown upon, or laugh at it for its folly: If we examine the climate of the country, the degrees of latitude, and the &s;everal &s;tars that chiefly govern, there is no good policy in the de&s;ign; &s;o that, methinks the uni|ver&s;al frame of nature cries it down for a <HI>Non compos mentis</HI>; for there are no &s;uch great creatures as are here conceived, can fare in hard cold countries as the <HI>Camelion</HI> does in warm, there mu&s;t be a very great hoard to &s;upport them; and nature does hone&s;tly confe&s;s, &s;he cannot an&s;wer the bills of fare, which belong to their table, and do her duty to the royal exchequer; and this mu&s;t be maintained, or all breaks to pieces.</P>
<P>Again, let it be con&s;idered, whether it been't great intel|lectual weakne&s;s, or want of policy, for one generation to contrive needle&s;s loads for the next, e&s;pecially when they may get as well to heaven, without carrying &s;uch packs a|long the road?

It is apparently an error, that care hath not been taken to find hor&s;e and man, and bating-places for both on this journey, otherwi&s;e for a le|gi&s;lative power to pre&s;cribe chargeable offices, and leave them de&s;titute of a temporal &s;upport, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;i|ty die to &s;ave charges, or turn mendicants, or hope in their travel to meet with the prophet's juniper-tree; all which are as di&s;agreeing with good rea&s;on as the propo&s;al it &s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">2. The moderator has an unlimited power during the prorogation of the a&s;&s;embly. (1.) He mu&s;t judge of emergencies, that he may &s;ummon the members; and being left ve&s;ted with &s;uch a prerogative, if after he has made his citation, he recants, he can then countermand his own order, though the gentlemen &s;hould be all mount|ed, and ready to move. (2.) If there chance to be an emergency of common concernment, if he finds his own favorites involved in the guilt and danger; he then gives no notice, but &s;tifles the bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o cheats the com|pany. (3.) And upon any di&s;gu&s;t, it is now at his mercy to null the whole frame; for he mu&s;t be in place till another be cho&s;en; and how will they get together, if he will not give the word? Unle&s;s they are creators of them&s;elves the &s;econd time, as they were the fir&s;t. That to in&s;titute &s;uch charitable de&s;igns without a fund, and tie &s;uch tru&s;t and dominion on the &s;houlders of men after &s;uch a lax and carele&s;s manner, and leave them at &s;uch loo&s;e ends, as ea&s;ily to make fools of men; for my own part, I &s;light &s;uch methods in government.</P>

<P><HI>Sect.</HI> And that if any mini&s;ter be accu&s;ed to the a&s;&s;oci|ation where he belongs, of &s;candal or here&s;y, the matter &s;hall be there examined, and if the a&s;&s;ociated mini&s;ters find ju&s;t occa&s;ion for it, they &s;hall direct a calling of the council, by which &s;uch an offender is to be proceeded a|gain&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> I mu&s;t boldly and freely enquire, whether this is an hone&s;t an&s;wer to the que&s;tion propounded in the head of the propo&s;als? Or whether in reality this is the &s;upport|ing, pre&s;erving &amp; well-ordering the intere&s;t of the churches there meant? If you mean as you &s;peak, I am &s;ure there is either &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;hone&s;ty or mi&s;under&s;tanding between the que|&s;tion and the an&s;wer; for it cant po&s;&s;ibly be otherwi&s;e, un|le&s;s the parts of &s;peech are lately become a chaos, and all words are not only of the doubtful gender, but &s;uch unrea|&s;onable epiceens, that not only both kinds, but both con|traries are &s;ignified in them; or thus, that to build, plant, repair, pluck up, pull down and demoli&s;h, are all now be|come convertable terms; for take away the&s;e high prero|gatives from the churches, and you take away their being. The&s;e and &s;uch like royalties, are their <HI>Formalis ratio,</HI> or the formal cau&s;e (<HI>per Quam Res e&s;t id quod e&s;t</HI>) by which they are, what they are; and this will be very evident, if we do but read a &s;hort lecture on the churches e&s;&s;ence ana|tomized, or let their e&s;&s;ential and con&s;tituent parts and powers be viewed in the hi&s;tory, and philo&s;ophy of their own beings, and we &s;hall quickly di&s;cern your mi&s;take; for that end read platform, chap. 5. &s;ect. 2. Ordinary church power, viz. of privilege belongs to the brotherhood, and may be acted or exerci&s;ed immediately by them&s;elves. And more directly to the ca&s;e in hand, look into chap. 10. &s;ect. 6. Where there we read&punc; If an elder offend incorrigi|bly, the matter &s;o requiring, as the church had power to call him to office, &s;o they have power, according to order (the council of other churches, where it may be had, di|recting thereto) to remove him from his office; and being now but a member, in ca&s;e he add contumacy to his &s;in, the church that had power to receive him into their fellow|&s;hip,

hath al&s;o the &s;ame power to ca&s;t him out, that they have concerning any other members.</P>
<P>Now herein we find an e&s;&s;ential article in the govern|ment and being of the&s;e churches, that they have and hold &s;uch juri&s;diction over their own members; that the highe&s;t tribunal eccle&s;ia&s;tical on earth, is there; and that their own delinquent private members, and publick officers are triable only there, and there they mu&s;t receive the definitive &s;entence, and abide the execution of it.</P>
<P>And if &s;o, then I &s;hall make bold to revive my query again, viz. Whether the propo&s;al is either honorable, civil or hone&s;t, thus to tumble down at one blow, this high &s;eat of authority? and to break open our pri&s;on doors&punc; and loo&s;e the fetters of our great offenders? and at the be&s;t to take them out of our hands, and make their mittimus to foreign pa&s;tors to do ju&s;tice upon them, and yet in the mean time to profe&s;s, they are doing us no other injuries but only repairing and mending our churches? Again, whether this is fair, and work-man-like among&s;t hone&s;t men.</P>
<P>But to make a &s;top here, I mu&s;t remind you, that this head is not to be pa&s;&s;ed over &s;lightly; for this is the one thing in the e&s;&s;ence of our churches, it is their peculiar in|franchizement and birth-right, and we may not &s;ell it with E&s;au, at a cheap market; if we do, we undo our&s;elves; for indeed you mu&s;t know, here lies the marring or mak|ing of our churches; here is laid up their &s;trength, and here hangs the pick-lock of their trea&s;ure; for by this key &s;tolen, or wrinched out of their hands, the churches of Chri&s;t in the world, have been expo&s;ed and plundered, for more than a thou&s;and years, and many of them have no|thing at this day left them, comparatively, but a poor, &s;tarved, &s;habbid implicit faith, and a dull, fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urnal blunt and blind obedience, that a man would &s;carcely give a groat for both of them. In a word, the u&s;urpations of the pa&s;tors, &s;ince the great revolt, having un&s;hackled one another, and broke loo&s;e from the re&s;trictions they are ju&s;tly &s;ubjected to, under the churches power of privilege, has utterly undone the chri&s;tian world, from this root of bitterne&s;s and pride, from this &s;eed &s;prung up, the man of &s;in, as we have it in an anomulous author, viz. the Elethe|rians, page 4. In words to this purpo&s;e, "Then a lit|tle prie&s;t had an opportunity to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf, then

there appeared in the temple of God that anti-chri&s;t, who calls him&s;elf the vicar of Chri&s;t." And then the &s;ame author going on to di&s;cover the original of this mon&s;trous birth; he &s;ays thus, "Anti-chri&s;t was conceived in, by, and from certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffectations of eccle&s;ia&s;tical preheminen|cies." As though he &s;hould &s;ay, the fir&s;t &s;pawn or embryo of that in&s;olent Hector, or a&s;piring Nimrod, (who fir&s;t robbed the laiety of their chri&s;tian liberties, and then hunted down the potentates of the world, and brought them as a rich &s;poil, into his habitation of violence) took its commencement from this principle, viz. from the cler|gies a&s;&s;uming to them&s;elves this eccle&s;ia&s;tical preheminence, viz. fir&s;t their obtaining an exemption from the cogni|zance of the churches, for their crimes, and then in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing them&s;elves of the &s;ole and ab&s;olute juri&s;diction (by a di&s;potic government) over the churches them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But however things have been hitherto, I &s;hall no longer uphold the debate, by revi&s;ing the abu&s;es that have been done to the chri&s;tian churches by an ambitious clergy, in the ages pa&s;t, which might more amply be di&s;covered, by tracing the foot-&s;teps of the great apo&s;tacy: But I &s;hall end the whole di&s;pute on this head, by drawing up a pro|te&s;t, and denying the juri&s;diction of the court, erected and opened by the propo&s;als, as being perfectly di&s;agreeing and repugnant to our former &s;ettlements, and pre&s;ent con|&s;titution.</P>

<P N="1">1. As to the a&s;&s;ociation, it is no diminution, or tre&s;pa&s;s upon the laws of honor or truth to affirm, "That the &s;ettled mini&s;try in general (with &s;ome rea&s;onable exception) is le&s;s expert in grammar and points of philo&s;ophy, than our learned children are at the degree of junior batchellors," and that from di&s;-u&s;e, proved from all experience, <HI>Nam u&s;us Promotos facit</HI>; and al&s;o for the &s;ake of more divine &s;tudies, which croud out tho&s;e fir&s;t ideas a great pace, ac|cording to that ob&s;ervation, on a learned memory, <HI>Imago Imaginem Expellit, Alii&s;&abque; Aliae Succedunt,</HI> for as one wave thru&s;ts out another, &s;o one idea another.

<P N="2">2dly. To US. Accademical learning we profe&s;s to be a very e&s;&s;ential accompli&s;hment in the go&s;pel mini&s;try. It is introduced by the ordinary ble&s;&s;ing of God upon human endeavours, to &s;upply the place of the cloven tongues, and tho&s;e other miraculous gifts and endowments of mind, impre&s;t upon Chri&s;t's amba&s;&s;adors, whereby fi&s;her-men commence <HI>(per Saltum)</HI> doctors of divinity; and in an in|&s;tant were &s;tock'd with &s;uch principles of religion, rea&s;on, and philo&s;ophy, that they were capable to di&s;pute with Athens it &s;elf, and baffle the greate&s;t wits &s;he could pro|duce, in defence, and for the advancement of Chri&s;t's kingdom, Act 17.18.</P>
<P>Thus it is very rea&s;onable that the churches &s;hould be well a&s;&s;ured of the &s;ufficiency of the learning of tho&s;e per&s;ons, e'er they pre&s;ume on the mini&s;try; yet there is a fairer way in view, fuller of honor and &s;afety, than what the propo&s;al directs to.</P>
<P>Our accademy is the &s;tore-hou&s;e of learning, and this all mankind will a&s;&s;ent to. When you have lo&s;t the company of the mu&s;es, there they are found in their freeholds, where they hold the ballance of honor among&s;t the learned.

<P>Indeed, the bold and brazen, who can make a greater figure with half the &s;tock, by many &s;hirking tricks, and di&s;&s;embling artifices, defended and &s;upported with confi|dence and delivery, may obtain the <HI>Euge Juvenis,</HI> that they no ways de&s;erve, as will be found, when they come to be detected by a more dilatory &s;earch, or a more tedi|ous <HI>Analy&s;is</HI> made of them.

<P N="2">2. Suppo&s;e the trial mu&s;t be made, and the que&s;tion determined by a per&s;on's conver&s;ation. And this is a very great article in the &s;tate of all &s;erviceable men, and e&s;peci|ally in the mini&s;try, 1 Tim. 4.12. 1 Pet. 5.3. Be|ing en&s;amples to the flock. Then certainly a more intimate conver&s;e and &s;ociety, is a very invincible plea. By the laws and cu&s;toms of England, the vicinage mu&s;t be al|lowed, as affording the mo&s;t competent judges, when per&s;ons reputation lies at &s;take in criminal ca&s;es, becau&s;e they are pre&s;umed to know &s;omewhat con&s;iderable of per|&s;ons and ca&s;es of their own knowledge; and &s;o more ca|pable of giving a ju&s;t verdict. So in the ca&s;e, what do tho&s;e per&s;ons know of our learned youth, who make up the a&s;&s;ociation? Our candidates appear on a certain day, (as blazing &s;tars once in an age, and are gazed on, and then they vani&s;h) Now what judgment can be made on a mans conver&s;ation, by &s;uch a tran&s;ient view? unle&s;s they mu&s;t be handled in this con&s;i&s;tory, as per&s;ons that have been bound to the peace, and in open court are to be delivered from their recognizance by three outcries?</P>
<P N="3">3. Suppo&s;e the whole &s;tock of mini&s;terial qualifications mu&s;t be enquired into, and judgment mu&s;t pa&s;s by the direction of apo&s;tolic law, 1 Tim. 3.2. Tit. 1.6.9. <HI>Let them be blamele&s;s, &s;ober, apt to teach,</HI> &amp;c. and add what more you plea&s;e, which the &s;cripture mentions, to fill up the character of an evangelical mini&s;ter, to compleat him in all his gifts and graces, either in his beginnings, or in his riper &s;tate; and it is mo&s;t apparent, that our particular pa&s;tors and churches, with the learning, experience, grace, wi&s;dom and di&s;cretion they are owners of, can make a more

upright, judicious and &s;olid trial; and give a better ac|count of our candidates from their frequent conver&s;e with them, and their occa&s;ional and repeated preaching among&s;t them, than the wi&s;e&s;t a&s;&s;ociation in the world can do; and it is ea&s;ier di&s;&s;embling with the latter, than the former, unle&s;s the a&s;&s;ociation will take them home, and both winter and &s;ummer them.</P>
<P>Now then, con&s;idering that their degrees with the ex|pre&s;s te&s;timony of the college (when particularly de&s;ired) are &s;ufficient te&s;timonials of their learning; and the expe|rience of their other good gifts and mini&s;terial qualificati|ons, obtained by conver&s;e, and their occa&s;ional preaching, has been the chief te&s;t and trial for our candidates; and by the&s;e methods they have been approbated in order to &s;ettlement in office-tru&s;t; and this has been the cu&s;tom of the country and churches for near four &s;core years. Where|fore to conclude this argument, I make this proclamation, That if any per&s;on or per&s;ons, di&s;affected with our old &s;et|tlements, and way in church conduct, will produce one example led into the public mini&s;try by this practice, which has ju&s;tly offended him, and he will or can evince this to be the blameable cau&s;e, we will then &s;urrender the cu&s;tom to your mercy.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. I &s;hall now implead the propo&s;al on a ju&s;t preju|dice or pre&s;umption of corruption in the clergy, tho' we are in charity for the pre&s;ent, yet in this way propo&s;ed, we have no a&s;&s;urance for the future, again&s;t the corruptne&s;s of &s;uch &s;ocieties; and let any &s;ober man ob&s;erve, and he will find abundance of poor tools under the mark of the office, where the&s;e mea&s;ures, and &s;uch like, are in force and form.

What then? &amp;c. as tho' he &s;hould &s;ay, What's that to you &s;ir? If Chri&s;t be preached, all is well. And as to our ca&s;e, we may &s;ay, de&s;pi&s;e not the day of &s;mall things, all men mu&s;t have a beginning, and every bird which is pretty well fleg'd mu&s;t begin to fly.

<P N="2">2. Under the go&s;pel, we have no preci&s;e time, though there was under the law, when to begin and enter into the mini&s;try, the go&s;pel knows no bar from time where per&s;ons are other ways meetly qualified. Days and qualifications, are divers things, and the latter are the e&s;&s;entials of a mi|ni&s;ter of Chri&s;t. It is not how old, but how capable a per&s;on is, which is the main point to be enquired after here. Therefore where (in &s;ome good mea&s;ure) there is an hone&s;t life, a gracious heart, an orthodox head, and a learned tongue, there is no rea&s;on to &s;end &s;uch youths to <HI>Jerico,</HI> with <HI>David</HI>'s me&s;&s;engers, (though their beards are not yet grown) to wait upon time and nature, for &s;uch an accompli&s;hment; for certainly tho&s;e recited are the princi|pal in the argument. It is a &s;tory in the hi&s;tory of Per&s;ia, "That when the Grecians &s;ent &s;ome very young noble|men upon an emba&s;&s;age to that court, the Per&s;ians reflect|ed upon the Grecian republic, for &s;ending b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rdle&s;s boys on &s;o grave a me&s;&s;age to &s;o mighty a monarch," To which the young Grecians very &s;martly an&s;wered, "That if &s;tate policy did con&s;i&s;t in beards, then he-goats would do for emba&s;&s;adors, as well or better than men."

a &s;ound precept) that forthwith another office be erected&punc; and put into the hands and under the government of a few men, exactly &s;killed in phy&s;iognomy, and deeply &s;tudied in the &s;ympathies and antipathies of human nature, with an ab&s;olute &s;uperintending power to controul and direct all wooers in their choice for the marriage bed; for that there is many a fond lover who has betrayed the glory of wedlock, by making an unwi&s;e and unfortunate choice; and why may not particular beds be over-ruled, as well as particular churches? both being for the good and &s;er|vice of mankind, and for that both parties, hu&s;band and wife, pa&s;tor and church, by our &s;ort of government, are bound for term of life, or &s;o long as both &s;hall live. In|deed, were our con&s;titution in church order under the &s;uper|intendency of a patron, or a lord bi&s;hop, who can &s;end <HI>(pro Tempore)</HI> a curate, &amp;c. and then recall him, and place another in his &s;tead, the project might be very ad|vi&s;eable; but &s;eeing the&s;e churches are &s;ettled congrega|tional, and by their principles, the ordination is, as it were, the nuptials, or marriage day of two lovers, that nothing but death, or a bill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> divorce (for betraying the glory of the union) can part; it is then good and rea&s;onable, that they be left to choo&s;e as they be&s;t affect, and not forci|bly be tied up to a kind of Hob&s;ons choice, one of the&s;e or none.

That the &s;tate of the vi&s;ible church &s;ince the coming of Chri&s;t, is only congregational; therefore neither national, provincial, nor cla&s;&s;ical; then what does this propo&s;al do here?</P>
<P>Al&s;o, our platform a&s;&s;erts the free electing power of the churches, chap. 5. In the&s;e words, ordinary church power is that of privilege, &s;uch as belong to the brother-hood, whereby they de&s;ign per&s;ons unto office. So al&s;o in chap. 10. In the&s;e words, the power granted by Chri&s;t unto the body of the church and brother-hood is a prerogative or privilege which the church doth exerci&s;e in the admi&s;&s;ion of her own members, and in chu&s;ing their own officers.

<P>Indeed, when great men turn beggars for &s;mall booties, with the famous general <HI>Baziliareous,</HI> it &s;ignifies, the ebb of fortune runs low with them; but when they a&s;k an an|cient inheritence upon gift, it &s;ignifies either the doner to be in a langui&s;hing po&s;ture, and that his e&s;tate is like to e&s;cheat to the crown, through failure of natural heirs, or el&s;e great boldne&s;s in the beggars. But what &s;hould be the meaning of this demand, who can divine? I hope they don't reckon the churches to be making their la&s;t will, and de&s;ign them for their heirs.</P>
<P>The churches in New-England are fairly po&s;&s;e&s;t of this high prerogative, viz. Of convening councils nece&s;&s;ary for their own well being, they are al&s;o as likely to continue as they were forty years ago, unle&s;s their own pa&s;tors &s;hould betray them. And they are al&s;o as capable of managing all in&s;truments devolved upon them by Chri&s;t, as they were in the days of their youth. Then what can we make of this contrivement, viz. When the churches &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;eek relief by council (as &s;ometimes the empe|ror, has been confined at the in&s;olent thre&s;hold of his ho|line&s;s, and upon his coming forth in his infallibility, this pile of temporal glory has been his hor&s;e-block; and &s;o here) they mu&s;t humbly wait at the door of the a&s;&s;ocia|tion, till they &s;hall be informed, When, what, who, and where they &s;hall have one.

Either tho&s;e who have promoted this de&s;ign in the country, or tho&s;e who have with&s;tood it? And al&s;o where has temptation prevailed mo&s;t? And to put this debate under a brighter light, I will make bold to recite a brief hi&s;tory of this matter, till we bring you to the nati|vity of the&s;e propo&s;als, and to the day wherein they were born; with &s;ome pre&s;ent improvement of the hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>About thirty years ago, more or le&s;s, there was no ap|pearance of the a&s;&s;ociations of pa&s;tors in the&s;e colonies, and in &s;ome parts and places, there is none yet. But af|ter the country had &s;uffered much in the &s;laughters and depredations committed by the heathen, and by many other afflictions, the neighbouring mini&s;ters in &s;ome counties, met to pray together, &amp;c. and for no other intent, that I ever knew or heard of. But after they had continued their meetings for &s;ome years, and others following the example began to conver&s;e together, and communicate ca&s;es, as be&s;t &s;uited each per&s;on; and at la&s;t perceiving they were al|mo&s;t gotton into a cla&s;&s;ical form, before they tho't of it, they began to give their meetings the &s;pecious titles of cla&s;&s;es, a&s;&s;ociations and eccle&s;ia&s;tical conventions, &amp;c. as &s;ecurely as tho' the&s;e titles were a fruit growing out of our
<PB N="137" REF="012626_0136_0F8B8E89DD8FD730">
own con&s;titution; and by degrees began to dream that they were really, and <HI>de Jure,</HI> what their new titles and late cu&s;tom had made them only <HI>de facto</HI>; and time in|crea&s;ed their inclinations and purpo&s;es to compa&s;s a more formal and compleat &s;ettlement. It is certain, their op|portunities were con&s;iderable, the keys of the church trea|&s;ures being put into their hands. The more the main point is &s;tudied, the more glory appears to feed mens ambition, like the impre&s;&s;ion by the eye, on our great parents in pa|radice, Gen. 3.8. The tree was plea&s;ant to the eyes, a tree to be de&s;ired. Alas! Alas! empire and &s;upream rule is a glorious thing! <HI>Parcere &s;ubjectis et debellare Su|perbus,</HI> is a very royal bu&s;ine&s;s. Now this conceit did be|gin pretty much to predominate, e&s;pecially in &s;ome gen|tlemen that were inclin'd to pre&s;byterain principles, men of worth and learning, who improving their advant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ges of &s;en&s;e and influence, to intreague others of a lower &s;et of intellectuals, &amp;c. bro't the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o near to a conclu|&s;ion, as you find it in the la&s;t recited propo&s;al, wherein you have the main of this hi&s;tory contained, like <HI>Homer's Illiads</HI> in a nut &s;hell.

<P>Thus have you a &s;hort account how things have been carried on, relating to a&s;&s;ociations; and having a conveni|ent cri&s;is, I &s;hall improve the hi&s;tory, to promote my pre|&s;ent de&s;ign, in a few particulars.</P>

<P N="2">2. Whether the&s;e propo&s;als here offered to view, be not like Aaron's golden calf? And whether they ought not to be &s;erved, as Mo&s;es dealt with that, (Exod. 32.20.) when he took it, and burnt it in the fire; and ground it to pow|der; for that it is very evident, that though it be but a calf now, yet in time it may grow (being of a thir&s;ty na|ture) to become a &s;turdy ox, that will know no whoa, and it may be pa&s;t the churches &s;kill then to &s;ubdue it.</P>
<P>For if I am not much mi&s;taken (and <HI>Pareus</HI> too) That great and terrible bea&s;t with &s;even heads and ten horns, de&s;cribed in the Revelations 13, was nothing el&s;e a few ages ago, but ju&s;t &s;uch another calf as this is. It was indeed finely &s;hap'd, &amp; of neat limbs, when it was fir&s;t calved; in|&s;omuch that the great potentates of the earth were much ravi&s;hed with its a&s;pect and features; &s;ome offered to &s;uc|kle it on the choice&s;t cows among&s;t all the herds of royal cattle, (that it might be large) hoping to &s;tock their own countries with the breed, &amp; when it was grown to a con&s;ider|able magnitude, to render it more &s;hapely and fair, they put iron tips on to its horns, and be&s;et its &s;tupenduous bulk with very rich ornaments, that they might make it the more awing to all beholders, and if po&s;&s;ible, by &s;uch artifi|ces to add to the natural pride rnd choler of the creature.</P>
<P>But alas, poor men! they have paid dear for their pro|digality and fondne&s;s; for this very creature that was but a calf when they fir&s;t began to feed it, is now grown to be &s;uch a mad furious and wild bull, that there is &s;carce a chri&s;tian monarch on earth, unle&s;s the great <HI>Anne,</HI> their Sweedi&s;h and Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ties, and their High Mighti|ne&s;&s;es, with this exception, there is &s;carce a potentate in the world, the be&s;t hor&s;e-man or hunt&s;-man of them all, that dare take this bea&s;t by the horns, when he begins to bounce and bellow. Indeed the emperor within the&s;e few years, has recovered &s;o much courage, that he took him by the tail, to drive him out of his royal granges, being quite angry, and weary with his cropping and brouzing on the flowers of his imperial crown. But otherwi&s;e the bea&s;t ge|nerally goes at large and does what he will in all princes dominions, and keeps them in awe. Therefore to con|clude, and infer, <HI>Ob&s;ta Principiis</HI>!

It is an ob&s;ervation, on the monarchy of bees, that the drones formerly &s;uppo&s;ed to be not only a lumpi&s;h, but a u&s;ele&s;s bee, yet is of that nature, and &s;o e&s;&s;ential a member of that common-wealth, that it is really the male-bee, and does impregnate the females, who are the &s;ole labourers in that kingdom, but when that cri&s;is is over, the poor drones are by common con&s;ent bani&s;hed, as a great incumberment. So in our ca&s;e, alas! what can be expected, when the lay-delegates have done the former jobb, but that they &s;hall be laid by, for their wi&s;dom and capacity is no ways admired in the&s;e propo&s;als. And it has always been found that the laity are a clog to clergy-men, when they begin to &s;oar a-loft, or above their pro|per &s;phere; and if you will but view the propo&s;al again, in the hindermo&s;t part of it, you will &s;ee a back-door ve|ry artificially fini&s;hed and left upon l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tch&punc; for their exclu&s;i|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n; for tho they are called to be members of the council

<P>And thus, we being a people &s;wimming in &s;uch plenty, that all our chargeable mea&s;ures both dome&s;tic in our pri|vate families, and public in church and common wealth, being not near &s;ufficient, to take off our wa&s;te, and &s;uper|fluous &s;treams, and our riches and &s;tores &s;o plainly over|loading us, we have here formed a creature, that will help to &s;up up all, &amp; &s;eeding upon our fall ba&s;kets, we &s;hall find that the further we go with <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s load the lighter we &s;hall grow; then who will not admire the wi&s;dom of the invention?</P>

<P>The que&s;tion being thus &s;tated, it is at every man's li|berty, to take the part in the disjunction which be&s;t likes him. I &s;uppo&s;e the propo&s;al arre&s;ted and brought to trial, will plead not erring, or not guilty, as is u&s;ual with all criminals, when indicted; and therefore &s;eeing you expect to be cleared by the jury, you mu&s;t give us an hone&s;t ac|count, who &s;et you on work, and what rule you were guided by to a&s;&s;ure us that your intellectual powers were free from error in forming this council, and we will give you room enough in your own defence.

<P N="1">1&s;t. If you can produce evidence from the canon of &s;cripture, in expre&s;s terms, or by &s;ound con&s;equence, and prove <HI>New-England</HI> churches are obliged to form a &s;tanding and &s;tated council, or that you are to do it for them, &amp;c. we will &s;ubmit. But no &s;uch canon can be found. The propo&s;als then incur a heavy premunire for making &s;o bold with a &s;ettled government, and no text to warrant the at|tempt.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is it by any authority, derived from the civil govern|ment of the country by law, or practice, that this council is here erected?</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="143" REF="012626_0142_0F8B8E8E2FBFF7F0">1. By law, if there be any &s;uch law, you have liberty to plead it in your own defence.</P>
<P N="2">2. By practice, has the civil government ever &s;et &s;uch an example? Have they ever intrenched upon the privili|ges of the churches in the lea&s;t degree? And in their own orb, are they not more exemplary? Don't all men keep to commi&s;&s;ion? Are they not curious in maintaining all &s;ettled forms, as the limits and boundaries of all mens ac|tions and intere&s;ts? Nay, is not the exalted head of this body politic in his whole mini&s;try, careful to &s;teer all his actions by his commi&s;&s;ion, and the precept of law? Is not the lea&s;t error (though made by jealou&s;y, and not found in reality) that looks but like an arbitrary action pre&s;ently drawn into complaint, as a great grievance, and common nu&s;ance? If it be but in dream, that the exche|quer appears touched, without a precept, or the wings of our civil liberties clipt, or &s;o much as a feather be plucked from them, is not the country here and the court at home filled with complaints? What means all this? And yet mu&s;t the&s;e churches, formed by principles of piety and honor, and under the &s;teerage of a wi&s;e and ju&s;t govern|ment, bear whole cart-loads of injuries, and have all their liberties violated? And at la&s;t have a &s;tated anti-chri&s;tian arbitrary council, that can cut their throats for all the wi&s;e regulation, that is in it, be thur&s;t in upon them, and both &s;cripture and the wi&s;e fathers of the common-wealth, no patrons to it?

<P N="3">3. Is there any certificate, order, or vote, from the churches, as the womb of this council? If there be, the propo&s;als &s;hall then pa&s;s for the innocent midwife, and no harm &s;hall come. But alas! if we &s;earch all church records, the pur&s;uit is blankt! Therefore it mu&s;t &s;tand for a daring intru&s;ion upon the churches power of privilege.</P>
<P>It is and will be acknowledged, with great ju&s;tice and &s;atisfaction, that the pa&s;tors of the churches are in a high &s;tation, as they repre&s;ent the great &s;hepherd, and their
<PB N="144" REF="012626_0143_0F8B8E9060926100">
tru&s;t is noble and great; they are rulers, and to conduct all tran&s;actions, &amp;c. But yet mu&s;t never infringe the churches power of privilege in any branch of it? It becomes the holine&s;s, wi&s;dom and honor of the ruling officers at a cri&s;is, when the churches are in exerci&s;e of this power, not to allow them&s;elves to dictate too imperiou&s;ly: They mu&s;t never indeed, in all their mini&s;tration, talk with &s;uch an elevated language, as in the 3d &s;ection of the &s;econd part, in the&s;e words, viz. That each church chu&s;e and depute one or more (private members) to attend their pa&s;tor in their &s;tated &s;e&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. As tho' the high commi&s;&s;ion court was returned from exile, and now opened, and &s;ome of your graces were to be lord chancellor; this plainly car|rieth too high a cre&s;t. What! to con&s;ider your&s;elves as a di&s;tinct e&s;tate from the churches, and to &s;end out of your higher hou&s;e your orders to be obey'd in the lower hou&s;e, &amp;c? But, I &s;ay, this is not right, for in convening and calling of councils the churches are your &s;uperiors; and upon a &s;evere interpretation of their canons, they may, if they plea&s;e, leave you at home. For tho' you have been elected once into office, yet in the exerci&s;e of this their power, you &s;tand but competitors with other principal per|&s;ons, for their choice &amp; election, to determine you members of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council: Po&s;&s;ibly this doctrine may &s;eem to be but a very crude do&s;e. But yet I a&s;&s;ure you, it is approbated by a college of very able and learned phy&s;ici|ans; and I hand it to you as I find it made up in the churches che&s;t of medicines, platform, chap. 16. &s;ect. 2. The efficient cau&s;e of eccle&s;ia&s;tical councils, or &s;ynodical a&s;&s;emblies, next under Chri&s;t, is the power of the churches &s;ending forth their elders and other me&s;&s;engers, &amp;c. &s;ect. 3. Magi&s;trates have power to call a &s;ynod, by calling to the churches to &s;end forth their elders, and me&s;&s;engers, &amp;c. for the con&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uting of a &s;ynod, is a church act, &s;ect. 6. Becau&s;e none are or &s;hould be more fit to know the &s;tate of the churches, nor to advi&s;e of ways, &amp;c. There|fore it is fit, that in the choice of the me&s;&s;engers for &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies, they have &s;pecial re&s;pect unto &s;uch, viz. elders: That certainly if you expect your council &s;hall e&s;cape con|demnation, you mu&s;t then produce the <HI>Probatum e&s;t</HI> of the churches, or el&s;e it peri&s;hes under this trial.</P>
<P N="4">4. Can you &s;hew any patent for the imperial chamber of our mighty monarch, to take into your hands (tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="145" REF="012626_0144_0F8B8E91254394D0">
you may new model) the&s;e churches (the royal deme&s;nes of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the prince of peace) as an e&s;cheat to the crown? Or have you commi&s;&s;ion with in&s;tructions from thence to erect within the province, &s;uch co&s;tly and for|midable a&s;&s;emblies, as are here projected? Nay, if you can find or pick up among&s;t the old &s;tatutes, that are not quite worn out, or produce one venerable precept or example throughout the whole Engli&s;h empire, for the govern|ment of church or &s;tate therein; we will &s;tate your ca&s;e, and grant you one imparlance (with due time) if you can make any rea&s;onable pre&s;umption, it may be had for your ju&s;tification; and in the mean time, I &s;hall venture to re|cite a few principles of the Engli&s;h government, that are like the <HI>Vana Cava,</HI> or great arteries in nature, which circulate the blood and &s;pirits thro' the imperial body; and if they don't all with a joint voice (like a jury in their return, where no man di&s;&s;ents) condemn your council and whole &s;cheme, you &s;hall &s;till have a goal delivery, and be &s;et free.</P>
<P><HI>Principle</HI> I. There is no one of the three e&s;tates of the empire, can make a valid act to bind the &s;ubject, or in|&s;titute any new forms of government.</P>
<P>It is certain the parliament, that &s;upream court, by an united voice, is very tran&s;cendent; it makes null, enacts, and abrogateth all laws, &s;tatutes and ordinances concerning matters eccle&s;ia&s;tical, civil, martial, martime, &amp;c. Therefore all acts, in&s;titutions, creations of tru&s;t, corporations and offices either originally and immediately, or by a fair con&s;equence, derive from this fountain the imperial crown, inricht with many prerogatives, and adorn'd with many ample flowers; they were there planted by the creating power of the na|tion, and no Engli&s;h monarch can at plea&s;ure enlarge that garden with a new &s;pecies. That to meet with &s;uch things as the&s;e now under debate within an Engli&s;h province, &amp;c. Query, Whether they are enacted by &s;ingle men, or &s;mall factions; or by the united voice of the kingdom? If not by the latter, they mu&s;t die traitors to the empire, as tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing again&s;t the e&s;&s;entials of its con&s;titution, and liberty of con&s;cience is no city of refuge here.</P>
<P><HI>Principle</HI> II. All Engli&s;h men are privileged by and &s;trickly bound to the law; that's the fruitful rea&s;on of all good, and rule of duty. To be bound to the peace, or
<PB N="146" REF="012626_0145_0F8B8E91C95E3180">
the good behavior, is to be bound to the law, that's every mans ma&s;ter and guide. Query, whether the&s;e propo&s;als, and this council, have not put a &s;light upon this do|minion?</P>
<P><HI>Principle</HI> III. The vengeance or vindictive ju&s;tice of the nation, flames (in the &s;anction of the law) again&s;t all tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Every one that breaks the law, breaks from the rule of his duty and tru&s;t, and in a degree violates the power of the nation, and u&s;urps the whole legi&s;lation; therefore in the execution of the&s;e direful &s;anctions and penalties affix|ed to the &s;tatutes, the omnipotent power of the nation, re|venges the glory of its own independence and unaccounta|blene&s;s upon its in&s;olent &s;ubjects, according to that, Gen. 2.17. <HI>In the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> Therefore I may &s;ay to this council, <HI>Memento Mori.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Principle</HI> IV. Every great per&s;on is under the awe of the law, either as directive or coer&s;ive.</P>
<P>It is the &s;aying of tho&s;e who are &s;killed in the law, That <HI>Reg in Rego Suo, Superiores habet, DEUM et LEGEM</HI>; The king has in his realm two &s;uperiors, GOD and the LAW, tho' he is only under the directive; but all his great &s;ubjects are under the coer&s;ive power of it. The nobles and great mini&s;ters in church and &s;tate look upon the law as the watchful eye of &s;ome direful numen. The &s;uperior clergy-men, the great bi&s;hops of the kingdom, tho' they appear ma&s;ters of &s;uch prerogatives, yet they have nothing but what they derive from the law; and the laws are their boundaries, &s;aying <HI>Hitherto you &s;hall go, and no further at your peril.</HI> That tho&s;e great men might as well have undertaken with <HI>Archimides,</HI> to have removed the earthly globe (upon condition) as to have done &s;uch a thing as this. What! to alter the con&s;titution of church government, which is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;tatute, and canon law of church and nation? This is to blow up the whole kingdom. <HI>Ergo,</HI> put out your matches, and di&s;&s;olve your trains.</P>
<P><HI>Principle</HI> V. All Engli&s;hmen live and die by laws of their own making. That they are never plea&s;ed with up|&s;tart law-makers.</P>
<P><HI>Principle</HI> VI. That Engli&s;h government and law is a charter-party &s;ettled by mutual compact between per&s;ons
<PB N="147" REF="012626_0146_0F8B8E928834E038">
of all degrees in the nation, and no man mu&s;t &s;tart from it at his peril.</P>
<P>Query, Whether the&s;e propo&s;als have kept to the ar|ticles of this great covenant?</P>
<P><HI>Principle</HI> VII. Engli&s;hmen hate an arbitrary power (politically con&s;idered) as they hate the devil.</P>
<P>For that they have through immemorial ages been the owners of very fair infranchizements and liberties, that the &s;en&s;e, favor or high e&s;teem of them are (as it were) <HI>extra|duce,</HI> tran&s;mitted with the elemental materials of their e&s;|&s;ence fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m generation to generation, and &s;o ingenate and mixed with their frame, that no artifice, craft or force u&s;ed can root it out. <HI>Naturam expellas furca licet u&s;que recurrit.</HI> And though many of their incautelous princes have endeavored to null all their charter rights and immu|nities, and agrandize them&s;elves in the &s;ervile &s;tate of the &s;ubjects, by &s;etting up their own &s;eperate will, for the great &s;tandard of government over the nations, yet they have all along paid dear for their attempts, both in the ru|in of the nation, and in interrupting the increa&s;e of their own grandeur, and their foreign &s;ettlements and conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>Had the late reigns, before the acce&s;&s;ion of the great <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> to the throne of England, but taken the mea&s;ures of them, and her pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, in depre&s;|&s;ing vice, and advancing the union and wealth, and en|couraging the prowice and bravery of the nation, they might by this time have been capable to have given laws to any monarch on earth; but &s;pending their time in the pur&s;uit of an ab&s;olute monarchy (contrary to the temper of the nation, and the ancient con&s;titution of the government) through all the meanders of &s;tate craft: It has apparently kept back the glory, and dampt all the mo&s;t noble affairs of the nation. And when under the midwifry of <HI>Machia|vilan</HI> art, and cunning of a daring prince, this MONSTER, tyranny, and arbitrary government, was at la&s;t ju&s;t born, upon the holding up of a finger! or upon the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t &s;ignal given, ON the whole nation goes upon this HYDRA.</P>
<P>The very name of an arbitrary government is ready to put an Engli&s;hman's blood into a fermentation; but when it really comes, and &s;hakes its whip over their ears, and tells them it is their ma&s;ter, it makes them &s;tark mad; and being of a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mical genius, and inclined to follow the court mode, they turn arbitrary too.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="012626_0147_0F8B8E934F4E2EB0">That &s;ome writers, who have ob&s;erved the governments and humors of nations, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> di&s;tingui&s;h the Engli&s;h:</P>
<P>The emperor (&s;ay they) is the king of kings, the king of Spain is the king of men, the king of France the king of a&s;&s;es, and the king of England the king of devils; for that the Engli&s;h nation can never be bridled, and rid by an arbitrary prince. Neither can any chains put on by di&s;potic and arbitrary mea&s;ures hold the&s;e legions. That to conclude this plea, I find not among&s;t all the catalogues of heroes or worthy things in the Engli&s;h empire, peers to the&s;e undertakers; therefore we mu&s;t needs range them with the arbitrary princes of the earth, (&s;uch as the great <HI>Czar</HI> or <HI>Ottoman</HI> monarch) who have no other rule to go|vern by, but their own will. And therefore under this branch of our di&s;cour&s;e, and their arbitrary mea&s;ures, I &s;hall venture to annex the following The&s;es, as conclu&s;i|ons fairly deducted from the premi&s;es, and leave them to con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;is</HI> 1. They have out-king'd all kings on earth, who&s;e prerogatives are bounded, and their kingdoms go|verned by law.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;is</HI> 2. They have out bi&s;hop't all the bi&s;hops of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> whil&s;t they they them&s;elves have acted with &s;uch lawle&s;s liberty, and left the bi&s;hops fettered in the &s;tatutes.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;is</HI> 3. They have out-pop't the pope him&s;elf, who is head of an hierarchy, &s;upported by certain laws, acts and ordinances, for the maintaining an harmony or union between head and members. So in the next place,</P>
<P N="4">4. We come to &s;urvey the work cut out for this coun|cil.</P>
<P><HI>CATO,</HI> that great and grave philo&s;opher, did com|monly demand (when any new project was propounded unto him) <HI>Cui Bono</HI>? or what good was like to en|&s;ue? Now in this pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s, the definition pretends to make a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to &s;uch a que&s;tion, viz. In the employment of this annual council; and that is to in|quire into the condition of the churches, and advi&s;e &s;uch things as may be for the advantage of our holy religion.</P>
<P>It is certain, con&s;idering the nature of the creature here formed, there had need be &s;ome <HI>Herculean</HI> labor a&s;&s;igned. Tho&s;e who are purveyors, and mu&s;t provide quarters, will find it very chargeable, that it had need do very extraor|dinary
<PB N="149" REF="012626_0148_0F8B8E940709E140">
bu&s;ine&s;s. As once king <HI>James</HI> the fir&s;t &s;aid to big-lim'd country fellow, who came to court to be a por|ter; &s;ome that knew him, told the king how many bowls full, and quarters of mutton he would eat at a meal; &s;ays the king to the fellow, You &s;irrah, that eat &s;o much more than other men, if you cannot do &s;o much more work than other men, by my &s;o'l (&s;ays the king) I'll hang you. So here, there had need go a hand&s;ome &s;tock of &s;mall cat|tle, and other expences to maintain one &s;e&s;&s;ions: that if it has confidence to meet, and is treated with an ordinary al|lowance, if it cant do abundance of work, it will be wa&s;te charges, and great incumberment.</P>
<P>Now, if this be all that is here propo&s;ed (in my opini|on) the creators are very defective in their proportions; for tho' the work mentioned is in it&s;elf good work; but it's all done already to their hands, there is nothing of this nature neglected in <HI>New-England</HI> churches; at lea&s;t, no means or methods wanted; but as God &s;ays, <HI>Jer.</HI> 5.4. "What could have been done more for my vineyard, that I have not done in it:" may properly be applied to the churches here, and all for the anvantage and good of our holy religion; that, in a word, there is no want in this country, unle&s;s it be the want of good and hone&s;t hearts; and I &s;uppo&s;e you have none of tho&s;e to bequeath, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.9. Upon the fir&s;t view of this &s;tupenduous bu&s;ine&s;s, I was ready to fancy, whether or no you had dream'd of, or &s;een king <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth a coming with his old ca&s;e and que&s;tion, which involved the pope, his conclave, and all the accademies in Europe, and whether you were get|ting a mighty ca&s;ui&s;t ready, to take the king's con&s;cience into con&s;ideration? Or, whether you had news of the old <HI>Arian</HI> war, its breaking out again, that you &s;hould in &s;uch ha&s;te, (without citing other e&s;tates for the defence of the kingdom, but only by virtue of your prerogative) run up &s;uch a formidable and co&s;tly redoubt? But if it be all come to this, and there is no more to do, than what every pious and wi&s;e man does every day, every week, and every &s;e&s;&s;ions, it is even another fit or paroxi&s;m of the mountains bringing forth, as the poet &s;ays, <HI>Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uriunt Montes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

&s;ervitude, may not vie it for merit, as equal in pains with any of the great prelates in Europe, in their laborious vi&s;itations; who when they come into &s;ome capital town in the other part of their dioce&s;s, and being treated with the &s;olemn formalities of &s;umptuous fea&s;ts by the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood, and having &s;pent the bige&s;t part of their pa&s;toral vi&s;it in glutting them&s;elves with honor and full tables; at la&s;t begin the other part of their work, and inquire (po&s;&s;ibly) how many pa|ri&s;hes in this great town, and whether there be any chy|rurgeons, phy&s;icians or &s;chool-ma&s;ters, that do good to their neighbours without licence? Or, whether there be any new <HI>Golgotha</HI>'s to be dedicated, for the &s;ecurer retreat of the dead to that place? Or, whether the pari&s;h curates read &s;ervice well, and ob&s;erve to time their particular le&s;|&s;ons, with the canonical days? And e&s;pecially, whether the bells are kept in good order? All which makes up a no|ble piece of &s;ervice, to requite a crown or kingdom for the revenues of a barony! And, whether it may be thought, that our great and yearly council, will come a whit behind the afore&s;aid mini&s;try in the fir&s;t or la&s;t part of &s;ervice mentioned? And whether if they do but equal them, we may not be thought to have made a wi&s;e &s;ettlement? But notwith&s;tanding we &s;hall grant, the propo&s;al makes menti|on of a chri&s;tian duty; for that it becomes all men, who bear a love to Chri&s;t, to enquire into the &s;tate of his chur|ches, both for the manife&s;ting their love to men, and di|recting their prayers and gratitude to GOD. Therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. As to their outward and temporal &s;tate, we may in|form our&s;elves, by virtue of neighbourhood, by chri&s;tian travellers, and public letters of intelligence: and thus we may rationally, and with very good moral certainty know the &s;tate of the churches, both in other countries and our own; and thus good Nehemiah informs bim&s;elf at <HI>Shu&s;han,</HI> how it fared with his brethren at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> Neh. 1.2, 3.</P>

And whether all the churches in the whole land are not honored and addre&s;t, from week to week, in &s;uch mea&s;ures by infallible truth, if not by infallible men? Or whether or no the&s;e me|thods dont divulge the whole mind of God to each plan|tation? Or, whether the&s;e gentlemen have any &s;ecrets of wi&s;dom not yet made known?

And, whether they will be thus hard hearted in religion, as the other are in philo&s;ophy, unle&s;s he will gra|tify them with this piece of prodigality here exacted? I mu&s;t acknowledge I have little patience towards the&s;e things, that under &s;uch a &s;pecious &s;hew and pretence, &s;uch a direful cata&s;trophe &s;hould be &s;hrouded!

<P N="1"><PB N="152" REF="012626_0151_0F8B8E97E3407D88">1&s;t. Civil authroity, in two great branches.</P>
<P N="1">1. Legi&s;lative power (that civil omnipotence) is doing very great things for religion, by their proclamations, and all penal laws enacted for the cru&s;hing of immorality and vice, and all their wi&s;e and exact precepts for the &s;upport of ju&s;tice and piety. They are opening many civil chan|nels, whereby they are conveying judgment, ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s down our &s;treets, from the great fountain. Nay, this great and dread a&s;&s;embly puts awe upon all mankind. And the more daring and de&s;perate are kept within compa&s;s, from a &s;en&s;e of this mo&s;t terrible &s;eat of thunder hanging over their heads, &amp; upon every affront ready to break in &s;trokes of vengeance and woes upon them, e&s;pecially if they grow beyond the reach of com|mon law.</P>
<P>And in ordinary ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">2. The executive power, or mini&s;ters of the law, are like a &s;tanding camp to awe, and a flying army to beat off the enemy; they have their &s;pies and &s;couts out in e|very quarter to ob&s;erve his motions, and break his mea|&s;ures, viz. In the innumerable numbers of all &s;orts of civil officers; and thus by the &s;word of ju&s;tice they hunt down &s;in and impiety in the land. They are a terror to evil men and a prai&s;e to them that do well; for the civil authority, by their wi&s;e and ju&s;t precepts, their per&s;onal and noble examples and zealous admini&s;trations, out-do <HI>Plato</HI> him|&s;elf with all his moral rea&s;ons; for they can turn a Sodom into a Sion, and keep Sion to be Sion evident by the hi&s;tory &amp; chronicles of &s;everal governments of God's ancient people. <HI>Nam Regis ad Exemplum Totus Componitur Orbis.</HI> For chief rulers, by their good or bad mea&s;ures, can make or marr, kill or cure a nation, in a moral &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>The churches.</HI></P>
<P>View once more, from &s;ome lofty promontory or <HI>Pi&s;|gah,</HI> tho&s;e goodly tents and tabernacles of I&s;rael! Li&s;ten! Is not God with them, and the &s;hout of a king among&s;t them? Are they not as valleys &s;pread forth, and as gar|dens by the river &s;ide, which the Lord hath planted? And yet notwith&s;tanding, may we, mu&s;t we under your con|duct, break up their fences, to give them another &s;ort of culture? Nay, con&s;ider well!

And may you not (in reckoning up of means) allow us peculiarly to a&s;cribe to their government and other of their mea&s;ures agreeing with the nature of it in dre&s;&s;ing the ground? But I will not enlarge this head; it is obvious enough from their mini&s;try, from their faith, their di&s;cipline and conver&s;ations.</P>
<P N="2">3. <HI>The nur&s;eries of learning.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The inferiour &s;chools, where the leaven is laid hid and kneaded in the &s;oft dough; <HI>Et Em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llit mores, nec &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nit e&s;&s;e feros,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2.The college (that artillery garden from whence we receive our mo&s;t expert &s;oldiers of Chri&s;t, and whence Chri&s;t's troops are &s;upplied with cheif commanders, who lead on to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">m the &s;trong holds of the common enemy, and &s;ecure our great ally, religion) this is the &s;eminary of learning and virtue, and the &s;ucce&s;s is almo&s;t to a miracle, unle&s;s for humiliation we mu&s;t &s;ecret the great grace and gifts of God which flow from that fountain, and are di&s;|per&s;ed through the land.</P>
<P><HI>Query.</HI> Were a council called, of all the learned heads of the whole univer&s;e, could they dictate better laws, and advi&s;e better mea&s;ures for the acquirement of learning, the increa&s;e of virtue and good religion, than are in that royal province?</P>
<P N="4">4. The families of the country with their oeconomy and family religion; if we take a &s;urvey of the whole land we &s;hall find religion placed in the body politick, as the &s;oul in the body natural. <HI>Nam e&s;t Tota Anima, in Toto Corpore, et Tota in Qualibet parte</HI>; that is, the whole &s;oul is in the whole body, and whole in every part. That were any other part of the body organized be&s;ides the head, it would be capable to exerci&s;e rea&s;on, &amp;c. So religion is placed and exerci&s;ed in its principles, virtues and govern|ments through the families of the country, &s;o many fami|lies &s;o many little &s;anctuaries.</P>
<P>I do acknowledge, there is no general rule, but has its execptions; but under this caution I may affirm, there is no &s;uch &s;pot of earth in the earthly globe (&s;o belaboured with family devotion, reading God's word, catechizing and well in&s;tructing youth, with neat and virtuous exam|ples and divine prayers, <HI>non ex Codice, &s;ed ex Corde,</HI> not out of books, but out of hearts, the &s;olemnizing &s;abbaths and

and family attendance on public means) as is <HI>New-England.</HI> And if &s;o, then what need have we of this late invention? Therefore to conclude, I &s;hall, for my own part, with the jeal|ous <HI>Laccoon,</HI> enter a caution again&s;t taking down the &s;ides of the city, or opening the walls of our Sion to let in this Trojan hor&s;e; and let all I&s;rael &s;ay, amen! For, ble&s;|&s;ed be God, tho' we want to have our hearts renewed daily, but as for means, though we have no glut, we have plenty enough, and want no new in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>We come now to mea&s;ure, and find out the time ap|pointed for the council.</P>
<P N="1">1. Certain, viz. Once in the year at the lea&s;t, all the a&s;|&s;ociations in the country, and according to the mo&s;t plau&s;i|ble interpretation of the propo&s;als, one or more lay-de|legates &s;hall join and meet yearly and every year in the great a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. As <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> &s;ays of time, <HI>Vivo in Tempore, Loquor de Tempere, &s;ed Ne&s;cio quid &s;it Tempus,</HI> I live in time, I &s;peak of time, but yet I know not what time is. So I do imagine, the dictators did not well weigh time by exact ballance, in all its contents, &s;en&s;e and meaning, when they carved out &s;uch a large proportion to this illegal claimer. Time is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed precious, in relation to heaven and grace, and al&s;o very valuable with re&s;pect to the intere&s;t of nature and this life. Therefore, care &s;hould be had, that it been't &s;quandered away wa&s;tfully. Our na|tural lives, healths and honor, families and e&s;tates are all very &s;ignificant and co&s;tly things, and their dependence is much on the well hu&s;banding of time, in&s;omuch that in hard &amp; penurious climates, the inhabitants had need be very &s;aving of time for the &s;upport of all the&s;e great intere&s;ts, and e&s;pecially &s;eeing there is &s;o much time already &s;et off for religion. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;eventh part of time is a&s;&s;igned by the wi&s;e au|thor of time, and that well improved, will do much for the &s;upport of religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. There are great proportions (out of the time left to our di&s;po&s;e) frankly bequeathed for the good of religion, as in courts, churches, college, &s;chool, families, clo&s;ets, and in many other &s;acred intervals, breathing &s;pells from the hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s, render to men more &s;edate and heavenly (called time out of &s;ea&s;on) and all for the &s;ervice of religi|on; then to add and make this offering al&s;o, without a di|vine mandate, is but a work of &s;uperarrogation or &s;uper|&s;tition,
<PB N="155" REF="012626_0154_0F8B8E9D90B8B360">
and &s;o will prove not only a needle&s;s, but an extra|vagant victim.</P>
<P>And moreover, to add a ju&s;t aggravation or two, to &s;et forth the evil in the impo&s;ition, I &s;hall, with them, con|clude the plea.</P>
<P><HI>Aggravation</HI> I. Is taken from the great and &s;ufficient care and provi&s;ion made by the 15th and 16th chapters of our platform, for the convening of occa&s;ional and needful coun|cils, for the &s;ervice of the churches, and &s;upport of religi|on upon all emergencies. Then what need we throw a|way &s;o many years of time at a venture, as is here ten|dered in the propo&s;al, before our nece&s;&s;ities or occa&s;ions call for the expence; unle&s;s we would in imitation of the <HI>Rho|dian Colo&s;s,</HI> or <HI>Egyptian Pyramids,</HI> erect a monument of our vain glory and pride, more than of our prudence, policy or duty.</P>
<P><HI>Aggravation</HI> II. Is taken from the great affront real and rational, done to empire.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Real,</HI> In making thus bold, with the time and e&s;tates of loyal &s;ubjects.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Rational</HI>; For let us but con&s;ider, that about three hundred men (gown men, and &s;word-men) with twice the number of attendants, which will make up near a thou&s;and &s;trong (and all well hors'd and provided) to be mu&s;tered no man living on earth can tell for what, cannot be well re&s;ented by crowned heads, tho&s;e admirers of order: That the project carried on, may breed jealou&s;ies in the heart of our prince, lea&s;t that <HI>Ket, Cade, Straw</HI> or <HI>Tyler</HI> have pitch't upon an oak of reformation again, with an intent to over|hawl the government, &amp;c. And e&s;pecially &s;eeing the crown was never advi&s;ed of any &s;uch thing (as is propo&s;ed) by the regular forms of empire. There is danger of lo&s;ing our time, and the credit of our loyalty together; that all things con&s;idered, the be&s;t way will be for us to keep well, whil&s;t we are well; and therefore let every man and &s;ociety be advi&s;ed to improve their time wi&s;ely, keep in their po&s;t and hone&s;tly &s;tudy to do their own bu&s;ine&s;s, which God, law and regular &s;ettlements has intru&s;ted them with; and we may then hope things will go well with us, and our holy religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Uncertain,</HI> viz. When the creators plea&s;e, and can a|gree, for the more particular time is be&s;t left to the deter|mination of each a&s;&s;ociation, as the propo&s;al affirms. And

<P N="6">6. We mu&s;t, according to promi&s;e, make &s;ome enquiry whether this council is to meet, or for the place of meeting?</P>
<P>It is held in opinion, that ca&s;tles in the air, &amp; immaterial &s;ub&s;tances do not occupy place; philo&s;ophy a&s;&s;igns them no more than a <HI>Ubi,</HI> where many may exi&s;t in <HI>Puncto Indivi&s;ibli,</HI> or on the point of a needle; and if this coun|cil is (as I apprehend it) belonging to that conjugation or cataloglue of beings, it will then have this privilege be|longing to it, viz. There will be no hou&s;e to build, nor hou&s;e rent to pay,</P>
<P N="7">7. We come now (in the la&s;t place) to con&s;ider its maintainance, by three queries.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t. Query,</HI> Whether the churches in their expiring, mu&s;t (as all criminals do) pay for their own execution, and their e&s;tates be confi&s;cate, and re&s;erved as a fund, yielding a certain &s;tipend per annum, to &s;upport their executioners?</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d. Query,</HI> Whether the contingent fees of the &s;e&s;&s;i|ons, or the free and voluntary contribution of clients, may be thought a medium &s;ufficient? Or,</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d.

<P><PB N="157" REF="012626_0156_0F8B8E9EA2AFF588">But how it is, or which way they intend to rai&s;e a &s;up|port for a &s;tanding council, yearly, and every year, I can|not find out; there is no &s;tipend &s;ettled, or provi&s;ion made in the canons, which give it being.</P>

Then why cant you fall in with the whole &s;ettlement, and &s;ay to your&s;elves, what need we &s;tand puzling our heads for new &s;chemes a|bout church-government? There is one from our begin|nings, that is compleat, being adju&s;ted by the laws of hon|or, and a&s;&s;igns to all parties their due, and gives to officers rule, power and honor enough; therefore let us, now we are met, order a new impre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o break up. For alas, alas! What need you, like the thievi&s;h bird, pick here and there a &s;traw or a feather in our yards, to build a new ne&s;t? or now and then gather up a kernal, or a grain out of our fir&s;t fruits? The whole plantation and crop is yours, if you plea&s;e to make u&s;e of it; and it will be your livelihood, as it has been hitherto; only you mu&s;t remem|ber to pay the quit-rent, as honorable tenants, and not take your&s;elves to be lords of the manor.</P>

<P>IT appears agreable with the pre&s;ent condition of our churches, and from our beginning acknowledged, that no act of the council is to be reckoned, concluded and de&s;icive, for which there has not been the concurrence of the major part of the pa&s;tors therein concerned.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> 1. The &s;pecificating act, that impowers any member for an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council, is the churches electi|on or delegation, according to our government; &s;o that the members &s;ent, are inve&s;ted with the power, and repre|&s;ent tho&s;e who &s;end them: The officers have no more of this power devolved upon them, than any member, and therefore can challenge no more right (as elders) in a ma|jor or in a negative vote, than any others, as is very ap|parent in all repre&s;entative bodies; therefore all acts mu&s;t be determined by the majority of the whole, as in the hou&s;e of commons, though made up of men of many dif|ferent characters, when in their own countries, both as to their tru&s;t, learning and wi&s;dom, and other di&s;tingui&s;hing qualifications; yet the meane&s;t man there has as great a force and power in his vote or &s;uffrage, as the be&s;t man in the hou&s;e, for that they all equally repre&s;ent the nation, one man as much as another: So in this ca&s;e; for that the churches and officers were never yet &s;ince New-England &s;tood, held or accounted two di&s;tinct e&s;tates in an eccle&s;i|a&s;tical council. Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. Your challenge plainly defines your intention, that is to null the power of the churches, and &s;et up your&s;elves, as the &s;ubject or fountain of a &s;uperintending power. And then, if the churches may have &s;o much favor as to repre|&s;ent them&s;elves by their lay-delegates, in a council you &s;hall &s;ee meet to call, you mu&s;t needs allow them to be a di&s;tinct hou&s;e and e&s;tate. And if &s;o, then you mu&s;t grant

them the privilege of a major vote, as well as your&s;elves, and &s;o nothing can be acted but by their compliance al&s;o. But I mu&s;t acknowledge, I have no plenipotentiary power to &s;ettle articles of agreement, for the infringing any of the rights of the churches, and therefore mu&s;t draw up my memorials or complaints of incroachments upon ancient lines and boundaries, and &s;o leave them.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THESE propo&s;als were a&s;&s;ented to by the delegates of the a&s;&s;ociation, met according to former agree|met at <HI>B. Sept.</HI> 13th, 1705, to be communicated.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The church of England has been wont to look upon us as men out of our wits, therefore they term us phantics, or mad-men, but much more now. What! for men to break from the government they them&s;elves have e&s;tabli&s;hed by con&s;ent and practice, and arbitrarily to rally together, and draw up a direful &s;entence (if not in terms, yet in intent) for the di&s;&s;olution of a country full of the be&s;t churches of Chri&s;t in the world, and then (as it were) upon the bold &s;ound of a trumpet, to excite others to ratify the dead warrant, in order to execution! What can this import or &s;ignify in the thoughts of con&s;iderate men, but a vertiginous brain? We might have learned better, and more caution, from that mother church of the
<PB N="161" REF="012626_0160_0F8B8EA315622EA0">
nation, if not from common rea&s;on; for though our &s;ove|reign confides in the loyalty of the Engli&s;h clergy, yet to maintain the grandeur of government, and keep in good repair that common &s;ence which keeps every man in his &s;tation, therefore, according to the law and cu&s;tom of En|gland, the convocation, both the higher and lower hou&s;e of that learned and augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, neither debates nor tran&s;acts any matter what&s;oever, but what our &s;overeign by commi&s;&s;ion expre&s;ly alloweth of, according to his pre|rogative; &s;o that certainly to acquit your&s;elves for wi&s;e men you &s;hould have done no le&s;s (in a matter of &s;uch weight and moment) than have petitioned the public authority for commi&s;&s;ion, before you had ventured thus far.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome may &s;ay, We have petitioned authority to e&s;tabli&s;h our councils, &s;ince we have drawn them up in form.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> This is to be prepo&s;terous, and agrees with that illegal way of hanging men and then judging them; but however it &s;eems they turned a deaf ear to your demands; and well they might, for they are two wi&s;e men to alter the laws of the province, long cu&s;toms and orderly &s;ettle|ments of the churches to gratify an implicit faith in the &s;tark naked <HI>Ip&s;e Dixits</HI> of any men; that unle&s;s you can produce a mandamus from the crown, or a precept from a higher court, which by its divine authority &s;hall awe and direct them, you may alway expect &s;uch entertainment in your precarious addre&s;&s;es; for mo&s;t certainly you beg at the wrong door. For you beg without a brief.</P>
<P>To be commended to the &s;everal a&s;&s;ociated mini&s;ters in the &s;everal parts of the country, to be duely con&s;idered.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> And why not commended to the general court, as has been the cu&s;tom of our beginnings, &amp;c. or why not commended nextly to the &s;everal churches? By the que&s;tion propo&s;ed, the comfort, &s;upport, and well being of the&s;e churches was peculiarly pretended, then why might not they be nextly advi&s;ed with, for their approbation or e&s;teem? for if you intend it for a new &s;uit, or change of apparel, or a &s;et of armour for this army in banners, it mu&s;t be the only way to try it on, it being now &s;o near fini&s;hing; and if it be done work-man-like, you will have the credit and they the comfort of it; but if it prove too &s;trait-laced, or &s;hould they feel them&s;elves as David in

They are &s;trict in their government; curious, yet charit|able in their admi&s;&s;ions; in the election of all officers, they are nice, cautious, judicious, and in the main hitherto very &s;ucce&s;sful.

Then why &s;hould you di&s;turb them?</P>
<P>You acknowledge them to be holy churches, and you may well!

<HEAD>The following is an Extract from a Book intituled, <HI>New-England's LAMENTATIONS,</HI> wrote by the Reverend Mr. JOHN WHITE, late Pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t Church in <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI>; to which is &s;ubjoined a Letter by another Hand, &s;hewing Rea&s;ons for adhering to our PLATFORM, as a Rule of Church-Government, and Objections again&s;t Ruling Elders an&s;wered: Which ex|tract and Letter are here in&s;erted at the Reque&s;t of a Number of the Sub&s;cribers to Mr. WISE's two Publi|cations.</HEAD>
<P>"THE pre&s;ent weak and &s;hattered &s;tate of our CHURCHES, on the account of their Order, Government, and Di&s;cipline, (&s;ays Mr. <HI>White</HI>) is matter of LAMENTATION. This is evident to e|very per&s;on of ob&s;ervation. Hence particular churches run into confu&s;ion. Many are aggrieved, and abide year after year in their &s;orrowful circum&s;tances. And a farther evidence thereof, is the ineffectualne&s;s of councils to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+lieve the aggrieved, and to make peace. As al&s;o anti-councils, whereby contrary re&s;ults are given on the &s;ame ca&s;e, to the great reproach of councils, and blemi&s;h of our church government, and di&s;couragement of the aggrieved, who are ready to lie under their troubles as remedile&s;s. Hence it is that &s;ome councils have per&s;waded the church and aggrieved, to promi&s;e to acquie&s;ce in the determination of the council, before they heard the ca&s;e, by which their con&s;ciences have been en&s;nared, and the council turned in|to a &s;olemn Arbitration. This therefore is matter of ju&s;t Lamentation.</P>
<P>I come to enquire,</P>
<P N="1">1. Into the MEANS, which have brought us un|der the&s;e lamentable circum&s;tances. In a word, 'tis our being prejudiced again&s;t, and not attending to the rules and principles of congregational churches, as laid down in our platform. To go from the rule is arbitrary; and to go again&s;t profe&s;&s;ed principles, making our wills the rule, is tyranny. And when a people fairly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of liberties
<PB N="166" REF="012626_0165_0F8B8EA854299730">
and privileges, are thus dealt with, this leads directly to contention and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. The&s;e churches have not attended the rule, as to the compleat organization of churches. 'Tis the privi|lege of a church to chu&s;e its own officers; as, platform, chap. 10. &s;ect. 5. viz. The power granted by Chri&s;t un|to the body of the church and brotherhood, is a preroga|tive and privilege which the church exerci&s;eth, in chu&s;ing their own officers, whether elders or deacons, &amp;c. So ch. 6. &s;ect. 4. Of elders &s;ome attend chiefly to the mini&s;try of the word, as pa&s;tors and teachers; &s;ome attend e&s;pecial|ly unto rule, who are therefore called ruling-elders. Now the want of the&s;e officers expo&s;es churches to arbitrarine&s;s, contentions and confu&s;ions. As al&s;o it renders the go|vernment of the church, in &s;ome ca&s;es impracticable. An in&s;tance of all the&s;e great inconveniencies, we have lately had in a neighbour church; where all po&s;&s;ible endeavors have been u&s;ed by the aggrieved (a very great and valuable part of the church) to have a church-meeting, and when there was great occa&s;ion for it; and yet it could not be obtained: They had not a church-meeting for about 14 years: Whereas if they had been furni&s;hed with a full &s;upply of officers, they might have ea&s;ily obtained it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that means put an end to a long and very threatning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tention. Be&s;ides, had the pa&s;tor called the church to|gether at their reque&s;t, there being but one elder, viz. a teaching one, and he the (&s;uppo&s;ed) offending party, it was not po&s;&s;ible according to congregational principles, to have proceeded to judge and cen&s;ure in that ca&s;e. For mini&s;ters are under no eccle&s;ia&s;tic government, but in the church, where they are members as well as mini&s;ters. Now 'tis a rule in the congregational government, as in plat|form, chap. 10. &s;ect. 11. No church-act can be con&s;umma|ted or perfected, without the con&s;ent of both; that is, the elder&s;hip and brethren. Now tis not at all proper, that an accu&s;ed and faulty elder &s;hould be a judge in his own ca&s;e; therefore when he is the peccant party and no ruling elders to join the brethren in an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">act of di&s;cipline and cen&s;ure, there cannot be a valid act. And &s;o it is al&s;o when a mini&s;ter is the accu&s;er. Thus by the di&s;u&s;e of ruling el|ders (&s;o nece&s;&s;ary in our con&s;titution) the government is rendered weak; yea, in &s;ome ca&s;es impracticable. There|fore it was that when the &s;ynod convened, <HI>Oct.</HI> 15, 1679,
<PB N="167" REF="012626_0166_0F8B8EA9229E1B38">
to enquire what wanted reformation in the land, and to propo&s;e expedients therefor; in the 5th place they &s;ay,
<Q>Tis requi&s;ite that the utmo&s;t endeavors &s;hould be u&s;ed, in order for a full &s;upply of officers in the churches, ac|cording to Chri&s;t's in&s;titution; the defect of the&s;e chur|ches on this account is very lamentable, there being in mo&s;t of the churches only one teaching officer for the burthen of the whole church to lie upon. The Lord Chri&s;t would not have in&s;tituted pa&s;tors, teachers, ruling elders, (nor the apo&s;tles ordained elders in every church) Acts 4.23. Tit. 1.5. if he had not &s;een there was need of them for the good of his people; therefore for men to think they can do well enough without them, is to break the &s;econd commandment, and to reflect upon the wi&s;dom of Chri&s;t, as if he did appoint unnece&s;&s;ary officers in his church. Experience hath evinced, that per&s;onal in&s;truction and di&s;cipline have been happy means to reform degenerate congregations; yea, and owned by the Lord for the conver&s;ion of many &s;ouls. But where there are great congregations, it is impo&s;&s;ible for one man be&s;ides his public labours, fully to attend tho&s;e other things of great importance, and nece&s;&s;ary to be done, in order to an effectual reformation of fami|lies and congregations.</Q>
Thus the &s;ynod.</P>
<P N="2">2. Again, the&s;e churches have reduced their church-&s;tate to great darkne&s;s, by not attending the rule of our con&s;titution in councils. It has been the practice of coun|cils convened according to the &s;econd way of communion in our platform, who are only to hold forth light, and give advice, to u&s;urp the power of judgment in matters of fact, as al&s;o the power of admonition, in ca&s;e of offence. Which to do is proper to the third way of communion; and &s;uppo&s;es that a church wants correction for an offence, and not merely light and coun&s;el. And by this means the third way of communion has been &s;hut out, and not practiced. This thing I am bold to &s;ay, has been the oc|ca&s;ion of all our anti-councils, as well as the contentions and confu&s;ions churches have been left in, after all endea|vors u&s;ed by neighbor churches, by way of councils.</P>
<P N="2">2. I come to the other thing remaining, and that is, the METHODS of our relief.</P>
<P>And here I would &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let our churches be advi&s;ed to get compleatly fur|ni&s;hed
<PB N="168" REF="012626_0167_0F8B8EA9DB728CE0">
with church-officers according to the platform. By this time I hope ye &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of it. Ari&s;e, for this matter belongs to you; and tis ju&s;t matter of offence if you neglect it any longer.</P>
<P>Remember, it is nece&s;&s;ary in a congregational church: And the mini&s;ters and members of the&s;e churches would do well to get reconciled to every part, and branch of the con&s;titution. Prejudices again&s;t, aver&s;ions and di&s;affecti|ons to the &s;ame, have greatly threatened the utter di&s;&s;olu|tion of the&s;e churches. Our government is firm and &s;trong; but if &s;uch as &s;hould keep it in good repair, do weaken it, it is in danger of falling to pieces. A brick hou&s;e (be it never &s;o firm) if every tenant takes out a brick, in time it will be weak, and &s;hatter to pieces. But &s;ome objections offer, which it may be needful to remove.</P>
<P N="1">1. Obj. Our reverend pa&s;tors are again&s;t it, and think that the office is not of divine right.</P>
<P>An&s;. 1. Mini&s;ters &s;hould reconcile them&s;elves to the congregational government before they accept of the pa&s;|toral office in &s;uch a church.</P>
<P N="2">2. There are e&s;pecially three &s;criptures, which may &s;atisfy the &s;crupulous, as to the divine right of ruling el|ders; as, Rom. 12.8. 1 Tim. 5.17. 1 Cor. 12.28. God has &s;et in his church, governments. The&s;e are church governors and di&s;tinct from teachers; who el&s;e can they be but ruling elders? Let &s;uch as have any con&s;ciencious &s;cruples in this affair, weigh in the ballance of the &s;anctua|ry, the arguments brought for the divine right of ruling elders, in a book entitled, <HI>Jus Divinum Regiminis Eccle&s;i|a&s;tici</HI>; as al&s;o a &s;heet not long &s;ince publi&s;hed, entitled, <HI>The Divine Right of Ruling Elders</HI>; as al&s;o, a rational and nervous letter lately publi&s;hed on this argument. Enough is &s;aid in the&s;e to &s;atisfy an unprejudiced mind as to their divine right.</P>
<P N="3">3. 'Tis the right and privilege of the brethren to chu&s;e their officers; and therefore if they be clear in the matter, they &s;hould not be di&s;couraged or ob&s;tructed in the u&s;e of their ju&s;t liberties.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the pa&s;tors will be &s;o arbitrary, as utterly to re|fu&s;e to call the church together to chu&s;e the&s;e officers; I &s;uppo&s;e, the church may look upon them&s;elves in that ca&s;e, and &s;o far, to be without a ruler; and may conve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e for this purpo&s;e, as when they have no mini&s;ter to chu&s;e
<PB N="169" REF="012626_0168_0F8B8EAA8704D448">
one. It mu&s;t be a great abu&s;e of a mini&s;ter's power, to ob&s;truct the church in the exerci&s;e of that power or privi|lege, Chri&s;t has given them, for the pre&s;ervation of their peace and purity. Engli&s;hmen can't patiently &s;ubmit to arbitrary mea&s;ures. Two kings, within our memory, have &s;marted for attempting it. One lo&s;t his head, the other his empire. And will Engli&s;h Chri&s;tians tamely &s;ubmit thereto? Can they be ea&s;y, when tho&s;e, who by divine appointment are to mini&s;ter to them for their &s;piritual edi|fication, Lord it over them who are God's heritage? 'Tis unrea&s;onable for any to de&s;ire or expect it, and ba&s;e for chri&s;tians to &s;ubmit to it.</P>
<P>Obj. 2. We would proceed to chu&s;e ruling elders, if there were any men in the church fit for it.</P>
<P>An&s;. 'Tis God's work to fit men for offices in church or &s;tate. 'Tis your duty to chu&s;e &s;uch as are be&s;t qualified, and depend upon God farther and more fully to fit them. I remember, as introductory to our election of ruling el|ders, near thirty years ago, I preached from tho&s;e words, Num. 11.25. And the Lord came down in a cloud, and &s;pake unto him, (that is to Mo&s;es) and took of the &s;pirit that was upon him, and gave it to the &s;eventy elders.&mdash; There is the re&s;idue of the &s;pirit to furni&s;h for every office of tru&s;t, to which one and another is cho&s;en. And in that the getting ruling elders was oppo&s;ed by many in town and church, I preached another &s;ermon from tho&s;e words in 2 Tim. 2.25. In meekne&s;s in&s;tructing tho&s;e that op|po&s;e them&s;elves. Reformations are commonly attended with great oppo&s;itions. Lay a&s;ide then I pray, your ob|jecting, and attend your duty.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let di&s;cipline be prudently, &s;trictly, and impartially exerci&s;ed in particular churches. Negligence and parti|ality herein is very hurtful to the peace, purity, and growth of churches.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let councils move in their proper &s;phere: Let them act agreable to their nature, and the rules laid down in the platform. Let &s;uch as are called to give advice, and to hold forth light, do that; and proceed no further.</P>
<P N="4">4. Come into the practice of the third way of com|munion, as laid down in the platform. When a church is rent with divi&s;ion among them&s;elves, and lie under any open &s;candal, and yet refu&s;e to con&s;ult with other churches
<PB N="170" REF="012626_0169_0F8B8EAB5E159578">
for healing and removing the &s;ame, this is matter of of|fence; and the aggrieved making a complaint hereof to a particular church, this church is in a chri&s;tian manner to make enquiry, and demand an account of the other church, in order to their conviction and admonition, if faulty; or in order to their vindication, if innocent: as in platform, chap. 15. There has been in times pa&s;t, great oppo&s;iti|on to the practice of this rule. But the late venerable council held at Salem, &s;aw cau&s;e to countenance the prac|tice of that way of the communion of churches, and advi&s;ed the aggrieved there, in ca&s;e they receive not &s;peedy &s;atis|faction from the reverend pa&s;tor, pur&s;uant to the re&s;ult and advice of &s;aid council, to apply to a particular church in the neighbourhood for help, as directed in the third way of communion. Which thing I humbly apprehend will prove of greater &s;ervice toward the e&s;tabli&s;hing the&s;e chur|ches, than any thing done for &s;cores of years. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis that rule, and the wi&s;e practi&s;ing it, that wipes off the raproach of independency from congregational churches. They are unaccountable, unle&s;s in this way.</P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis this rule that pre&s;erves churches pure in their com|munion one with another. For if a church gives offence, &amp; continues ob&s;tinate in any &s;inful way, and other churches held communion with &s;uch di&s;orderly church, &amp; dont u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means to reclaim her, they are partakers of her &s;in. But there is no other regular way to enquire into her ad|mini&s;trations, to convince her, and admoni&s;h her, and &s;e|parate her from their communion, but this. Altho' one church has not authority over another, yet churches have power to pre&s;erve the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> purity, and to put a church ob&s;tinately offending out of their communion; or el&s;e they mu&s;t hold fellow&s;hip with her in a &s;inful way.</P>
<P N="3">3. This rule is nece&s;&s;ary to the peace of particular churches, as it will effectually relieve per&s;ons aggrieved. There can't much peace be expected where a great part of a church, are gauled by arbitrary mea&s;ures. But in this way they mu&s;t give &s;atisfaction, or &s;u&s;tain the &s;entence of non-communion. And this opens a door for all aggrieved ones, to re&s;ettle in an orderly way, in &s;tated fellow&s;hip in &s;ome neighbour church, as tho' they had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="4">4. This rule doth effectually hinder anti-councils, or having councils again&s;t councils; of which there have been too many in&s;tances, to the great reproach and con|fu&s;ion
<PB N="171" REF="012626_0170_0F8B8EAC2E30D828">
of the&s;e churches. For if aggrieved per&s;ons are al|lowed to call councils, the church has power and liberty to call them; and by this means, anti-councils come upon the &s;tage. But if the aggrieved make complaint to a par|ticular church, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of anti-councils. Tis therefore mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h to be wondered at, that &s;uch mighty op|po&s;ition has been made again&s;t introducing this rule into practice in the&s;e churches. And tis matter of thankful|ne&s;s that the way is prepared by the fore&s;aid council at Salem, for the practice thereof.</P>
<P>Obj. It may be objected, this rule was not put in prac|tice in the early days of the&s;e churches.</P>
<P>An&s;. 1. Our fathers were but men, and had their de|fects. Hence, though they in the &s;ynod declared &s;o fully for the full &s;upply of officers in the church; and this re|&s;ult of the &s;ynod was approved by the general court, re|commending the &s;ame to the &s;erious con&s;ideration of all the churches; yet how &s;hamefully has this expedient for reformation been di&s;regarded by mo&s;t of our churches!</P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;uppo&s;e the true rea&s;on why the third way of com|munion was not practi&s;ed in our early days, was becau&s;e then there was little or no occa&s;ion for it; churches were more tender and willing to receive light, when offered by councils called in the &s;econd way of communion: And when it is thus, there is no room for the practice of this rule.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add the following moving con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. Our church-government is too good to be &s;lighted and thrown away. I am per&s;uaded 'tis nearer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;crip|ture and better warranted and &s;upported by it, than any church government in the world.</P>
<P>As to the church of England, there is no &s;cripture foun|dation for their hierarchy, as, arch-bi&s;hops, lord-bi&s;hops&punc; arch-deacons, officials, chancellors, &amp;c. Of late, by one and another ma&s;terly hand, the following truth has been &s;et in &s;o clear a light, that none but the wilfully ignorant can re&s;i&s;t it, viz. That the &s;cripture bi&s;hop, is no other than the pa&s;tor of a particular church. And it is an inno|vation and u&s;urpation, that they are dignified as they are in the church of England. Be&s;ides, to take out of the hands of the pre&s;byters or pa&s;tors all rule in the church, is un&s;criptural; for what is more plain, than that they who watch for &s;ouls, are to rule over them al&s;o? as Heb. 13.17. Their taking away from churches the liberty of
<PB N="172" REF="012626_0171_0F8B8EACD8A19E48">
chu&s;ing their own officers, is an intollerable inva&s;ion of the right of churches, as well as their introducing many un&s;criptural ceremonies into divine wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Again, the pre&s;byterian government, I grant, has been accompanied with eminent holine&s;s; as witne&s;s the church of Scotland, Geneva, and many other reformed churches. And I acknowledge there is but little difference between them and us; e&s;pecially, if we have ruling elders, and practi&s;e the third way of communion. Yet wherein we differ, I am humbly of opinion we have the &s;cripture on our &s;ide. Let any if they can, give a genuine interpreta|tion of the 1 Cor. 5 chap. and ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lude the brethren from having any hand in church di&s;cipline and cen&s;ures. Be|&s;ides what is written, Mat. 18. Tell it to the church; that is &s;ay they, to the mini&s;ters. This is to put the &s;cripture upon the rack, to make it &s;peak what we would have it. Let us then be thankful for our con&s;titution; &s;trictly ad|here to and practi&s;e it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our church-government, if &s;trictly adhered to, will effectu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly an&s;wer all the intentions of government. There is no member in a church, no church in the whole con&s;o|ciation of churches, tho' never &s;o &s;tubborn and ob&s;tinate, but mu&s;t &s;ubmit, or &s;u&s;tain the dreadful &s;entence of non-communion: which methinks no good mini&s;ter and chri&s;|tian can make light of.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the whole with a few words further by way of advice or coun&s;el.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us be very thankful to God, who has hitherto &s;ecured for us our civil and &s;acred privileges; notwith|&s;tanding our great barrenne&s;s and unprofitablene&s;s, yea, and our many and great provocations. God is &s;low unto anger, and abundant in goodne&s;s and kindne&s;s. We have for an 100 years enjoyed the di&s;pen&s;ation of the glorious go&s;pel, in its power and purity, and free from per&s;ecution. What could God have done for this his vineyard, which he has not done, in order to our fruitfulne&s;s?</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us be warned again&s;t withdrawing from the fel|low&s;hip of the&s;e churches, until we find more pure chur|ches and wor&s;hip; and of a more &s;criptural faith and or|der. Such as break with, and break off from the&s;e chur|ches, becau&s;e their &s;tubborn wills will not &s;ubmit to the ju&s;t and regular cen&s;ures of the church to which they be|long; or becau&s;e they cant have their will, as to the place
<PB N="173" REF="012626_0172_0F8B8EADB1DC4840">
of their wor&s;hip; the&s;e de&s;erve the character of heady and high-minded. And if their unrea&s;onable de&s;ires are re|&s;trained by the civil government, then they will turn churchmen. Surely &s;uch church-men are guilty of will-wor&s;hip with a witne&s;s. The&s;e converts are worthy to be called children of Belial, who ri&s;e up again&s;t lawful autho|rity, and take &s;anctuary in the church. The church of England doth too much honor our churches, when they ac|count tho&s;e worthy of their fellow&s;hip, who are worthy to be rejected by us. I would wi&s;per in the ears of the&s;e thoughtle&s;s and unnatural converts, not to &s;ay apo&s;tates; will you ra&s;hly, and to have your wills in le&s;&s;er matters, re|turn to a &s;tate of bondage, when you enjoy matchle&s;s li|berties and privileges? Will you take upon you a yoke which your gracious predece&s;&s;ors could not bear? Will you bring a burd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en upon po&s;terity, which is intollerable, to humour and ea&s;e your&s;elves? Know, when the yoke is once on your necks, you mu&s;t pay the tythe, the tenth part of which you are apt now to think is too much for you to give, or your mini&s;ter to receive. And do you think the va&s;t arrearages will not be recovered, one way or other? I mean the va&s;t &s;ums expended for the propa|gation of the go&s;pel; that is, for the bringing over our churches to the mother church.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be kind to your mini&s;ters; and dont give them any ju&s;t provocation to de&s;ert you, or to endeavor to reconcile them&s;elves to the di&s;cipline and ceremonies of the church. The di&s;count of the bills of credit has in&s;en&s;ibly and ex|ceedingly hurt them in times pa&s;t; and it is well if it be not &s;o to this day with &s;ome. I am fully per&s;uaded that mini&s;ters &s;alaries ought in ju&s;tice to be rai&s;ed nearly in pro|portion to the depreciation of the bills of credit; for the price of the nece&s;&s;aries of life ri&s;e in proportion. By no means di&s;courage the hearts, or weaken the hands of your faithful mini&s;ters, who are willing to &s;pend and be &s;pent, in the &s;ervice of your precious &s;ouls. E&s;pecially be cauti|ous at this juncture, when &s;o great temptations are laid be|fore them to de&s;ert you, and go home and take orders.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, and finally, Study the principles of your faith and order; be heartily reconciled to, and be zealous in the defence and practice of them. And as often as any of our holy churches do want a pa&s;tor, I would advi&s;e them when treating with any candidate in order to &s;ettlement,
<PB N="174" REF="012626_0173_0F8B8EAFE3B5AD88">
to know his mind with re&s;pect to the profe&s;&s;ed faith and order of the&s;e churches; and proceed not to election; un|til he has given his a&s;&s;ent to the one, and his promi&s;e to practi&s;e according to the other. This indeed is implicitly done by his acceptance of the invitation of a congregatio|nal church; but the more explicit, the better. And when the elders and me&s;&s;engers of neighbour-churches are (upon invitation) convened, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the &s;olemn &s;epara|tion of a pa&s;tor to the &s;acred work of the go&s;pel-mini&s;try, in his ordination; they would doubtle&s;s do well to &s;atisfy them&s;elves in the&s;e things, le&s;t they be found to lay their hands too &s;uddenly upon his head.</P>
<P>To conclude, Let us then &s;tand fa&s;t in the liberties wherewith Chri&s;t hath made us free, Gal. 5.1. Our country thinks it worth while to &s;pend many thou&s;ands, in defence of their civil privileges, &s;ettled upon us by charter; and are not the&s;e &s;acred privileges of equal, yea of greatter worth and value? O then let us contend ear|ne&s;tly for the faith and order of the go&s;pel, le&s;t we be found to de&s;pi&s;e our birth-right, and to de&s;troy our&s;elves."</P>

<HEAD>REASONS For adhering to our PLATFORM, as a Rule of Church-Government, and Objections again&s;t Ruling ELDERS an&s;wered. In a Letter to a Friend. By another Hand.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received a me&s;&s;age from you, that a friend of yours de&s;ires to have &s;ome rea&s;ons (drawn up in writing) to &s;hew why we &s;hould adhere to the PLATFORM as a rule of church-government, at lea&s;t till another &amp; better be provided. I wi&s;h a better head were employed in a&s;&s;ign|ing rea&s;ons for it: But to gratify you (in the interim) I &s;hall give you the general rea&s;ons inducing me to be of the opinion that we ought &s;o to do. But fir&s;t I premi&s;e, that whereas it is objected, That the &s;criptures are the only rule both of wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, and that it is both &s;inful and dangerous to &s;et up human compo&s;ures as our rule; I perfectly agree with the objectors and acknowledge that no human compo&s;ure ought to be received, which di&s;agrees with the holy &s;criptures. But if the platform mu&s;t be rejected merely becau&s;e it is of human compo|&s;ure; then by the &s;ame parity of rea&s;on, not only the a&s;|&s;ociation principles, but al&s;o all &s;ermons, confe&s;&s;ions of faith, creeds, catechi&s;ms, and the like, are to be rejected, the&s;e being al&s;o human compo&s;ures. And it is very ob&s;ervable that the &s;ame per&s;ons who are for rejecting the platform, would at the &s;ame time have us &s;ubject to &s;uch a govern|ment as they them&s;elves &s;hall from time to time fancy to be agreable to the &s;criptures; not allowing us to judge for our&s;elves, whether it be agreable to the &s;cripture or not; nor willing to be governed or re&s;tricted them&s;elves by any rule, except the &s;criptures in the &s;en&s;e they them|&s;elves under&s;tand them, or (which is one and the &s;ame thing) by any other than what agrees with their own &s;enti|ments. And with this allowance I &s;uppo&s;e the Pope him|&s;elf could comply with the &s;cripture as the rule of his government.</P>
<P>But that there ought to be a platform extracted from the Holy &s;criptures, as a particular rule of church-govern|ment, and that it is our wi&s;dom and intere&s;t to adhere to ours, at lea&s;t till another and better be provided, is evi|dent to me, from the following con&s;iderations, viz.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="176" REF="012626_0175_0F8B8EB154662718">1. The nature, u&s;e and ends of all government nece&s;|&s;arily imply ORDER: Order cannot be pre&s;erved without known and certain rules: The duties of rulers and ruled mu&s;t be &s;tated, circum&s;cribed, and limited by a rule; other|wi&s;e rulers may be tyrants at plea&s;ure, and &s;ubjects rebel whenever they have opportunity, and neither of them be accountable.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tho' the &s;criptures are in them&s;elves a perfect rule, and the only &s;tandard by which all other rules are to be tried; yet it is evident that through the darkne&s;s or cor|ruption of men's minds, this rule is very diver&s;ly under|&s;tood and practi&s;ed upon, both with re&s;pect to doctrine and di&s;cipline. Hence the authors of the mo&s;t corrupt doctrines pretend to the &s;criptures to &s;upport their tenets. So with re&s;pect to church-government, the congregati|onali&s;t, the pre&s;byterian, the epi&s;copalian, yea, and even the papi&s;t, pretend to rule and govern according to the &s;cripture. So that they don't &s;o much differ upon the que&s;tion, whether the &s;cripture &s;hall be the rule, as upon the que&s;tion, how the &s;cripture is to be under&s;tood; or what is agreable and what contrary to it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence it follows, that without &s;ome platform or con|&s;titution, there can be no orderly government upheld. This appears to be agreable to the &s;en&s;e both of papi&s;ts &amp; prote&s;tants, epi&s;copalians, pre&s;byterians and congregationa|li&s;ts; who all have their platforms or con&s;titutions of church-government.</P>
<P N="4">4. The church-government in this country is founded upon a particular compact or agreement: wherein the officers and members of each particular church combine to &s;et forward the wor&s;hip of God, and maintain the di&s;cipline of his kingdom, in a way which they judge to be agreable to the Holy Scriptures; and to act in way of con&s;ociation with other churches of the &s;ame principles, for their mu|tual good and edification. 'Upon this foundation were the churches of New-England fir&s;t &s;ettled; and for their more regular proceeding therein the platform (expre&s;&s;ing their &s;en&s;e of the &s;cripture relating to church order and govern|ment) was compo&s;ed and con&s;ented to by the churches in our primitive times: And this form of government is &s;o far e&s;tabli&s;hed, that our general con&s;ent to continue and abide in this way, would &s;ecure to us the privileges of it. And this indeed is our only barrier again&s;t epi&s;copacy; unle&s;s &s;ome other form of government (not di&s;allowed by
<PB N="177" REF="012626_0176_0F8B8EB209552CE8">
the crown) be received and embraced by the churches.</P>
<P N="5">5. But if we &s;light the method of government in our platform, and don't by agreement fix on another, it will follow, that either the government of the church mu&s;t cea&s;e, or a government impo&s;ed and enforced by human laws mu&s;t &s;ucceed. I pre&s;ume mo&s;t certainly, the churches (&s;o unhinged) mu&s;t immediately fall into an ab&s;olute inde|pendency at fir&s;t: and the members of each individual church, mu&s;t either be allowed to be under no government but what will &s;uit with their own private judgment on the &s;criptures (which they may be tempted to vary or alter as occa&s;ion may offer;) or el&s;e a power of judging for them|&s;elves as to the meaning of the &s;cripture mu&s;t be denied to the brethren, and put over to the mini&s;ter for him to judge and determine as he thinks fit, and to &s;tate and fix the boundaries both of his own authority and the people's obedience, as he &s;hall from time to time under&s;tand the &s;cripture. And who can tell how much or how often his judgment may al&s;o vary, upon occa&s;ions or temptations which may offer? But &s;uch a confu&s;ed &s;tate of things can't la&s;t long; a more certain and regular form of govern|ment will quickly be found nece&s;&s;ary; and perhaps a pre&s;byterian government may be &s;ought after, but not found to be attainable. May it not therefore be proper (before we part with our platform) not only to enquire whether the pre&s;byterian con&s;titution be more agreable to the &s;cripture; but al&s;o whether that government can be &s;et up and &s;upported here, unle&s;s &s;ome other laws than we have hitherto had, be enacted, and do obtain the royal appro|bation. That the royal approbation may be obtained in favor of the way of the church of England, can't be doubt|ed; but that it will be obtained in favor of a pre&s;byterian church government here, &s;eems hardly probable: which if duly con&s;idered, it may well be wondered how gentle|men (who would not be willing that them&s;elves or po&s;teri|ty &s;hould be placed under epi&s;copacy) can think of depart|ing from our own platform; at lea&s;t till another and bet|ter be in&s;tituted in the room thereof.</P>
<P N="6">6. Our platform was doubtle&s;s the re&s;ult of great tho't and deliberation, and of earne&s;t prayer and &s;upplication; compo&s;ed and con&s;ented to by men of as great learning, piety and prudence as any our age affords; and &s;uch as had
<PB N="178" REF="012626_0177_0F8B8EB2CD059288">
more knowledge and larger experience of the &s;tate of the church at home and abroad, than perhaps any among us of the pre&s;ent age have; and as careful of avoiding human inventions as the be&s;t of us. Now the platform agreed with their under&s;tanding of the &s;cripture, not only then, but many years after, when it was revi&s;ed by a &s;ucceeding &s;y|nod. And I am per&s;waded, if it were now impartially con&s;idered and compared with the &s;cripture, it would be found very con&s;onant therewith. And even that part there|of which a&s;&s;erts the office of the ruling elder (which is as I &s;uppo&s;e the mo&s;t di&s;ta&s;tful, to &s;uch as would explode the platform) agrees with the &s;cripture not only in the judgment of the divines and churches in New-England in our pure&s;t times; but al&s;o in the judgment of the mo&s;t famous reforming divines and churches that have been in other parts of the world. Both the nece&s;&s;ity and divine authority of that office having been a&s;&s;erted by divines va&s;tly more in number than tho&s;e (among pre&s;byterians and congregationali&s;ts) who do or have decried it; and not inferior to them in learning, piety or &s;olid judgment. I am told by a gentleman of learning and ingenuity, That the prote&s;tant churches of Geneva, France, Scotland, Holland, and in general almo&s;t all the churches of the re|formation (except epi&s;copalians) have upheld this office; and that it has never been denied by any con&s;iderable num|ber of prote&s;tant churches (exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pt as afore&s;aid) till that about the &s;pace of fifty years ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a number of mini&s;ters ro&s;e up in New-England, who did oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>Upon the whole therefore, tho' no man's con&s;cience ought to be bound by this or any other platform, in any matter which he verily believes to be contrary to the &s;cripture; yet it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to conceive, how a particular church can uphold an orderly di&s;cipline, or a number of churches form a con&s;ociation, unle&s;s they do unite in the foundation-principles of church-government; or that the civil authority pre&s;cribe the rules or canons of church-go|vernment, and enforce obedience, and &s;ubjection thereto, as in the ca&s;e of national churches.</P>
<P>From the foregoing con&s;iderations laid together, I think it will appear to be the wi&s;dom and intere&s;t of all tho&s;e who prefer our own con&s;titution before a national church government, and its forcing canons, &s;teadily to adhere to our platform; at lea&s;t till another and better be found,
<PB N="179" REF="012626_0178_0F8B8EB398F51960">
and (after mature con&s;ideration) con&s;ented to and agreed upon by the churches.</P>
<P>And now becau&s;e the office of a ruling elder is an e&s;&s;en|tial branch of congregational church-government, which if left out, quite alters the con&s;titution, and changes the government of the church into a monarchical form; and becau&s;e I apprehend that the prejudices that are taken again&s;t the platform, are principally upon this head; I would now acquaint your friend (tho' this is further than his reque&s;t expre&s;&s;es) upon what grounds I &s;atisfy my &s;elf re&s;pecting the objections I meet with again&s;t that office.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whereas it is objected, That the generality of our mini&s;ters do not hold this office to be of divine in&s;titution: to this objection I oppo&s;e the judgment of formor divines (more in number, and not le&s;s capable of judging as to the meaning of the &s;criptures;) as al&s;o the judgment of &s;everal divines now living among us.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whereas'tis objected, that according to Eph.IV.8.11.12. the ordinary officers left by Chri&s;t in the church, are only pa&s;tors and teachers; and according to Phil. 1.1. bi&s;hops (or pa&s;tors) and deacons are the only officers mentioned: I &s;atisfy my &s;elf as to this objection, by con|&s;idering that the word bi&s;hop, pa&s;tor and &s;hepherd, &s;ignify one and the &s;ame thing whenever applied to eccle&s;ia&s;tical officers; and imply a power af teaching, over&s;eeing, feed|ing and governing. The word pa&s;tor is applicable to all rulers whether civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and is &s;o u&s;ed in &s;cripture; and tho' the word bi&s;hop &s;eems in a more ap|propriated &s;en&s;e to belong to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical ruler; yet under that word &s;o appropriated are comprehended all eccle&s;ia&s;tical rulers, guides, over&s;eers, &s;hepherds; even as the word magi&s;trate comprehends all civil rulers of every rank and &s;tation. So that neither of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions do exclude any &s;ort of elder, over&s;eer or ruler in the church; but on the contrary do include and comprehend them all. And tho' a power of teaching, over&s;eeing and ruling, may all be attributed to one man; yet it does not follow that the power of over&s;eeing and ruling mu&s;t lie &s;olely and ab|&s;olutely in him. For there may be, and is, a government, where there is not a lordly power, or (which is the &s;ame thing) power in a &s;ingle officer, which has no other branch of government to check and controul it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whereas 'tis objected, That we have not men capa|ble, &amp;c. If it be &s;o indeed, that there are no men in our
<PB N="180" REF="012626_0179_0F8B8EB49E5895D0">
churches, that have &s;kill enough or integrity enough to guide in the external admini&s;trations of the government and di&s;cipline of the church; and capable too of a&s;&s;i&s;ting, directing, exhorting and comforting their brethren, as they may have opportunity; our degeneracy is very lamen|table indeed. Our churches have then none &s;uitable for &s;ervice in eccle&s;ia&s;tical councils. Every thing at home and abroad mu&s;t be left to the prudence and fidelity of the mini&s;ters; and wo to that church (if &s;uch a thing &s;hou'd bappen) that falls under the influence of a mini&s;ter no bet-qualified than them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4">4. I find an a&s;&s;ertion in a late printed pamphlet, that the keys of doctrine and di&s;cipline were committed to the apo&s;tles. And again, To be &s;ure to the &s;ame per&s;ons is there committed the ruling and feeding of the flock. The author refers to the la&s;t chapter of Matthew. But would he re&s;train the power of ruling to the per&s;ons of the apo&s;tles or to the per&s;ons of go&s;pel mini&s;ters as their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors in the work of teaching and baptizing, and to them only; he mu&s;t then either prove the government of the church to be monarchical, or el&s;e that every church is obliged to provide a number of &s;uch teaching elders.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another objection is, That if we will have ruling elders, we mu&s;t provide them a maintainance; and this, &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, would fright us out of the notion of &s;uch of|ficers. But to me it appears no ways formidable. For in the fir&s;t place, I don't believe that double honor princi|pally intends maintainance (as &s;ome would have it, from 1 Tim. 5.17.) and the next words proves no more than this, that a &s;uitable reward is due, according to the labour performed. It therefore remains to be proved, that a ruling elder mu&s;t &s;pend his whole time in the &s;ervice of the church, before he is entitled to a maintainance from the church. But if a &s;uitable and honorable reward were a&s;|&s;igned in proportion to their &s;ervice, I believe no body would have rea&s;on to complain; and abundance of good might be done, and evil prevented, by their prudent la|bours, which would take up no great quantity of time. And in extraordinary matters, I &s;ee no rea&s;on but their la|bors &s;hould be hand&s;omely rewarded. Submitting the whole to the cen&s;ure of your friend, (unknown to me) I re&s;t</P>

<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;etting forth of the publick confe&s;&s;ion of the faith of churches hath a double end, and both tend|ing to public edification: Fir&s;t, the maintenance of the faith intire within it&s;elf: Secondly, the holding, forth of unity and harmony, both among&s;t, and with o|ther churches. Our churches here, as (by the grace of Chri&s;t) we believe and profe&s;s the &s;ame doctrine of the truth of the go&s;pel, which generally is received in all the reformed churches of Chri&s;t in Europe, &s;o e&s;pecially we de&s;ire not to vary from the doctrine of faith and truth held forth by the churches of our native country. For though it be not one native country that can breed us all of one mind; nor ought we to have the glorious faith of our Lord Je&s;us with re&s;pect to per&s;ons, yet as <HI>Paul,</HI> who was him&s;elf a Jew, profe&s;&s;ed to hold forth the doctrine of ju&s;ti|fication by faith, and of the re&s;urrection of the dead, ac|cording as he knew his godly country-men did, who were Jews by nature, (<HI>Gal</HI> 2.15. <HI>Acts</HI> 26.6, 7.) &s;o we who are by nature Engli&s;h-men, do de&s;ire to hold forth the &s;ame doctrine of religion (e&s;pecially in fundamentals) which we &s;ee and know to be held by the churches of <HI>England,</HI> according to the truth of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The more we di&s;cern (that which we do, and have cau&s;e to do with ince&s;&s;ant mourning and trembling) the unkind, and unbrotherly, and unchri&s;tian contention of our godly brethren and country-men in matters of church government; the more earne&s;tly do we de&s;ire to &s;ee them join together in one common faith; and our&s;elves with them. For this end, having peru&s;ed the public confe&s;&s;ion of the faith, agreed upon by the reverend a&s;&s;embly of di|vines at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and finding the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance thereof (in matters of doctrine) to expre&s;s not their own judgment only, but ours al&s;o; and being likewi&s;e called upon by our godly magi&s;trates, do draw up a public con|fe&s;&s;ion of that faith which is con&s;tantly taught, and gene|rally profe&s;&s;ed among&s;t us; we thought good to pre&s;ent unto them, and with them to our churches; and with
<PB N="184" REF="012626_0183_0F8B8EB9AABFF458">
them to all the churches of Chri&s;t abroad, our profe&s;&s;ed and hearty a&s;&s;ent and atte&s;tation to the whole confe&s;&s;ion of faith (for &s;ub&s;tance of doctrine) which the reverend a&s;&s;em|bly pre&s;ented to the religious and honorable parliment of <HI>England</HI>: Excepting only &s;ome &s;ections in the 25, 30. &amp; 31. chapters of their confe&s;&s;ion, which concerns points of controver&s;y in church di&s;cipline; touching which we refer our&s;elves to the draught of church di&s;cipline in the en|&s;uing treati&s;e.</P>
<P>The truth of what we here declare, may appear by the unanimous vote of the &s;ynod of the elders and me&s;&s;engers of our churches, a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the la&s;t of the &s;ixth month, 1648, which jointly pa&s;&s;ed in the&s;e words; This &s;ynod having peru&s;ed and con&s;idered (with much gladne&s;s of heart, and thankfulne&s;s to God) the confe&s;&s;ion of faith publi&s;hed of late by the reverend a&s;&s;embly in <HI>En|gland,</HI> do judge it to be very holy, orthodox and judicious in all matters of faith; and do therefore freely and fully con&s;ent thereunto, for the &s;ub&s;tance thereof. Only in tho&s;e things which have re&s;pect to church-government and di&s;cipline, we refer our&s;elves to the platform of church-di&s;|cipline, agreed upon by this pre&s;ent a&s;&s;embly; and do therefore think it meet, that this confe&s;&s;ion of faith &s;hould be commended to the churches of Chri&s;t, and to the honor|ed court, as worthy of their due con&s;ideration &amp; acceptance. Howbeit, we may not conceal, that the doctrine of vocati|on, expre&s;&s;ed in chap. 10. &s;ect. 1. and &s;ummarily repeated in chap. 13. &s;ect. 1. pa&s;&s;ed not without &s;ome debate. Yet con&s;idering the term of vocation, and others by which it is de&s;cribed, are capable of a large, or more &s;trict &s;en&s;e and u&s;e, and that it is not intended to bind apprehen&s;ions pre|ci&s;ely in point of order or method, there hath been a gene|ral conde&s;cendency thereunto.</P>
<P>Now by this our profe&s;&s;ed con&s;ent and free concurrence with them in all the doctrinals of religion, we hope it may appear to the world, that as we are a remnant of the peo|ple of the &s;ame nation with them, &s;o we are profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame common faith, and fellow-heirs of the &s;ame common &s;alvation. Yea moreover, as this our profe&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame faith with them, will exempt us (even in their judgments) from &s;u&s;picion of here&s;y; &s;o (we tru&s;t) it may exempt us in the like &s;ort from &s;u&s;picion of &s;chi&s;m: that though we are forced to di&s;&s;ent from them in matters of
<PB N="185" REF="012626_0184_0F8B8EBA44CCBAB0">
church-di&s;cipline, yet our di&s;&s;ent is not taken up out of ar|rogancy of &s;pirit in our&s;elves (whom they &s;ee willingly conde&s;cend to learn of them) neither is it carried with un|charitable con&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s towards them, (both which are the proper and e&s;&s;ential characters of &s;chi&s;m) but in meek|ne&s;s of wi&s;dom, as we walk along with them, and follow them as they follow Chri&s;t; &s;o where we conceive a diffe|rent apprehen&s;ion of the mind of Chri&s;t (as it falleth out in &s;ome few points touching church-order) we &s;till re&s;erve due reverence to them (whom we judge to be, through Chri&s;t, the glorious lights of both nations) and only crave leave (as in the &s;pirit we are bound) to follow the Lamb with|er&s;oever he goeth, and (after the apo&s;tles example) as we believe, &s;o we &s;peak.</P>
<P>And if the example of &s;uch poor out-ca&s;ts as our&s;elves might prevail, if not with all (for that were too great a ble&s;&s;ing to hope for) yet with &s;ome or other of our breth|ren in <HI>England,</HI> &s;o far as they are come to mind and &s;peak the &s;ame thing with &s;uch as di&s;&s;ent from them, we hope in Chri&s;t it would not only moderate the har&s;h judging and condemning of one another in &s;uch differences of judg|ment as may be found in the choice&s;t &s;aints; but al&s;o pre|vent (by the mercy of Chri&s;t) the peril of the di&s;traction and de&s;truction of all churches in both kingdoms. Other|wi&s;e, if brethren &s;hall go on to bite and devour one ano|ther, the apo&s;tle feared (as we al&s;o with &s;adne&s;s of heart do) it will tend to the con&s;uming of them, and us all: which the Lord prevent.</P>
<P>We are not ignorant, (that be&s;ides the&s;e a&s;per&s;ions of here&s;y and &s;chi&s;m) other exceptions al&s;o are taken at our way of church-government, (but as we conceive) upon as little grounds. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. That by admitting none into the fellow&s;hip of our church but &s;aints by calling, we rob many pari&s;h churches of their be&s;t members, to make up one of our congregati|ons, which is not only to gather churches out of churches, (a thing unheard of in &s;cripture) but al&s;o to weaken the hearts and hands of the be&s;t mini&s;ters in the pari&s;hes, by de&s;poiling them of their be&s;t hearers.</P>
<P N="2">2. That we provide no cour&s;e for the gaining and call|ing in of ignorant, and erroneous, and &s;candalous per&s;ons,
<PB N="186" REF="012626_0185_0F8B8EBC69E7D050">
whom we refu&s;e to receive into our churches, and &s;o ex|clude from the whol&s;ome remedy of church-di&s;cipline.</P>
<P N="3">3. That in our way we &s;ow &s;eeds of divi&s;ion, and hin|drance of edification in every family; whil&s;t admitting in|to churches only voluntaries, the hu&s;band will be of one church, the wife of another; the parents of one church, the children of another; the ma&s;ter of one church, the &s;er|vants of another. And &s;o the parents and ma&s;ters being of different churches from their children and &s;ervents, they cannot take a ju&s;t account of their profiting by what they hear; yea, by this means the hu&s;bands, parents and ma&s;ters &s;hall be chargeable to the maintenance of many other churches, and church-officers, be&s;ides their own; which will prove a charge and burthen un&s;upportable.</P>
<P>But for an&s;wer, as to the fir&s;t; for gathering churches out of churches, we cannot &s;ay that it is a thing unheard of in &s;cripture. The fir&s;t chri&s;tian church was gathered out of the Jewi&s;h church, and out of many &s;ynagogues in that church, and con&s;i&s;ted partly of the inhabitants of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and partly of the <HI>Galileans</HI>; who though they kept &s;ome communion in &s;ome part of publick wor|&s;hip with the temple, yet neither did they frequent the &s;acrifices, nor repair to the &s;anhedrim for the determining of their church cau&s;es, but kept intire aad con&s;tant com|munion with the apo&s;tles church in all the ordinances of the go&s;pel. And for the fir&s;t chri&s;tian church of the Gentiles at <HI>Antioch,</HI> it appeareth to have been gathered and con&s;tituted partly of the di&s;per&s;ed brethren of the church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> (whereof &s;ome were men of <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Cyrene</HI>) and partly of the believing Gentiles. <HI>Acts.</HI> 11.20, 21.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, the fir&s;t chri&s;tian church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and that at <HI>Antioch,</HI> were gathered not out of any chri&s;tian church, but of the Jewi&s;h temple and &s;ynagogues, which were &s;hortly after to be aboli&s;hed: and their gathering to <HI>Antioch</HI> was upon occa&s;ion of di&s;per&s;ion in time of per|&s;ecution,</P>
<P>We de&s;ire it may be con&s;idered, 1. That the members of the Jewi&s;h church were more &s;trongly and &s;traitly tied by expre&s;s holy covenant, to keep fellow&s;hip with the Jewi&s;h church till it was aboli&s;hed, than any members of chri&s;tian pari&s;h churches are wont to be tied to keep fel|low&s;hip with their pari&s;h churches. The epi&s;copal canons, which bind them to attend on their pari&s;h church, it is
<PB N="187" REF="012626_0186_0F8B8EBC9607B1B8">
likely they are now aboli&s;hed with the epi&s;copacy. The common law of the land is &s;atisfied (as we conceive) if they attend upon the wor&s;hip of God in any other church, though not within their own pari&s;h. But no &s;uch like covenant of God, nor any other religious tie lieth upon them to attend the wor&s;hip of God in their own pari&s;h church, as did lie upon the Jews to attend upon the wor|&s;hip of God in their temple and &s;ynagogues.</P>
<P N="2">2. Though the Jewi&s;h temple church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was to be aboli&s;hed, yet that doth not make the de&s;ertion of it by the members to be lawful, till it was aboli&s;hed. Fu|ture abolition is no warrant for pre&s;ent de&s;ertion, unle&s;s it be lawful, in &s;ome ca&s;e, whil&s;t the church is yet in pre|&s;ent &s;tanding, to de&s;ert it; to wit, either for avoiding pre|&s;ent polutions, or for hope of greater edification, and &s;o for better &s;atisfaction to con&s;cience in either. Future e|vents, or fore&s;ight of them do not di&s;&s;olve pre&s;ent relati|ons, el&s;e wives, children, &s;ervants, might de&s;ert their hu&s;|bands, parents, ma&s;ters, when they be mortally &s;ick.</P>
<P N="3">3. What the members of the Jewi&s;h church did, in joining to the church at <HI>Antioch</HI> in time of per&s;ecution, it may well be conceived the members of any chri&s;tian church may do the like for &s;atisfaction of con&s;cience. Peace of con&s;cience is more de&s;irable than the peace of the outward man; and freedom from &s;cruples of con&s;cience is more comfortable to a &s;incere heart, than freedom from per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, the&s;e members of the chri&s;tian church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> that joined to the church at <HI>Antioch,</HI> removed their habitations together with their relations; which if the brethren of the congregational way would do, it would much abate the grievance of their departure from their pre&s;byterial churches.</P>
<P>We verily could wi&s;h them &s;o to do, as well approving the like removal of habitation, in ca&s;e of changing church relations (provided that it may be done without too much detriment to their outward e&s;tates) and we for our parts have done the &s;ame. But to put a nece&s;&s;ity of removal of habitation in &s;uch a ca&s;e, it is to foment and cheri&s;h a cor|rupt principle of making a civil co-habitation, if not a formal cau&s;e, yet at lea&s;t a proper adjunct of church re|lation, which the truth of the go&s;pel doth not acknow|ledge. Now to fom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt an error to the prejudice of the

truth of the go&s;pel, is not to walk with a right foot, ac|cording to the truth of the go&s;pel, as <HI>Paul</HI> judgeth, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 1.</P>
<P N="4">4. We do not think it meet or fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, for a member of a pre&s;byterial church forth with to de&s;ert his relation to his church, betake him&s;elf to the fellow&s;hip of a congregation|al church, though he may di&s;cern &s;ome defect in the e&s;tate or government of his own. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Faithfulne&s;s of brotherly love in church-rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion, re|quireth that the members of the church &s;hould fir&s;t con|vince their brethren of their &s;inful defects, and duly wait for their reformation, before they depart from them. For if we mu&s;t take &s;uch a cour&s;e for the healing of a private brother, in a way of brotherly love, with much meekne&s;s and patience; how much more ought we &s;o to walk with like tenderne&s;s towards a whole church.</P>
<P>Again, 2. By the ha&s;ty departure of &s;ound members from a defective church, reformation is not promoted, but many times retarded, and corruption increa&s;ed. Where|as on the contrary, while &s;incere members breathing after purity of reformation abide together, they may (by the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon their faithful endeavors prevail much with their elders and neighbours towards a reformation, it may be &s;o much as that their elders in their own church &s;hall receive none to the &s;eals but vi&s;ible &s;aints; and in the cla&s;&s;is &s;hall put forth no authoritative act (but con&s;ultative only) touching the members of other churches, not touching their own, but with the con&s;ent (&s;ilent con&s;ent at lea&s;t) of their own church. Which two things, if they can obtain with any humble, meek, holy, faithful endeavors, we con|ceive they might (by the grace of Chri&s;t) find liberty of con&s;cience to continue their relation with their own pre&s;|byterial church without &s;cruple.</P>
<P N="5">5. But to add a word further, touching the gathering of churches out of churches: what if there were no expre&s;s example of &s;uch a thing extant in the &s;criptures? That which we are wont to an&s;wer the antipaedo-bapti&s;ts, may &s;uf|fice here: It is enough, if any evidence thereof may be ga|thered from ju&s;t con&s;equence of &s;cripture-light. Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> his judgment concerning this ca&s;e pa&s;&s;eth (for ought we know) without exception, which he gave in his fourth look of con&s;cience, in an&s;wer to two que&s;tions, chap. 14. num. 16. If any (&s;aith he) wronged with unju&s;t vexation,

or providing for his own edification, or in te&s;timony again&s;t &s;in, depart from a church, where &s;ome evils are tolerated, and join him&s;elf to another more pure, yet without con|demning of the church he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">leaveth, he is not therefore to be held as a &s;chi&s;matic, or as guilty of any other &s;in.</P>
<P>Where the tripartite disjunction which the judicious doctor putteth, declareth the lawfulne&s;s of the departure of a church member from his church, when either through wearine&s;s of unju&s;t vexation, or in way of provi&s;ion for his own edification, or in te&s;timony again&s;t &s;in, he joineth him|&s;elf to another congregation more reformed; any one of the&s;e he judgeth a lawful cau&s;e of departure, tho' all of them do not concur together. Neither will &s;uch a practice de&s;poil the be&s;t mini&s;ters of the pari&s;hes of their be&s;t hearers.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Sometimes the mini&s;ters them&s;elves are willing to join with their better &s;ort of hearers in this way of refor|mation, and then they and their hearers continue &s;till their church relation together; yea, and confirm it more &s;traitly and &s;trongly, by an expre&s;s renewed covenant, tho' the mini&s;ters may &s;till continue their wonted preaching to the whole pari&s;h.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the mini&s;ters do di&s;like the way of tho&s;e whom they otherwi&s;e count their be&s;t members, and &s;o refu&s;e to join with them therein; yet if tho&s;e members can procure &s;ome other mini&s;ters to join with them in their own way, and &s;till continue their dwelling together in the &s;ame town, they may ea&s;ily order the times of the public a&s;&s;embly, as to attend con&s;tantly upon the mini&s;try of their former church, and either after or before the public a&s;&s;embly of the pari&s;h, take an opportunity to gather together for the admini&s;tra|tion of the &s;acraments and cen&s;ures, and other church-ordinances among&s;t them&s;elves. The fir&s;t apo&s;tolic church a&s;&s;embled to hear the word with the Jewi&s;h church in the open courts of the temple, but afterwards gathered toge|ther for breaking of bread, and other acts of church or|der, from hou&s;e to hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. Suppo&s;e pre&s;byterial churches &s;hould communicate &s;ome of their be&s;t gifted members towards the erecting &amp; gather|ing another church, it would not forthwith be their detri|ment, but may be their enlargement. It is the mo&s;t noble &amp; perfect work of a living creature (both in nature and grace) to propagate and multiply his kind; and it is the honor
<PB N="190" REF="012626_0189_0F8B8EC046EB4D20">
of the faithful &s;pou&s;e of Chri&s;t to &s;et forward the work of Chri&s;t as well abroad as at home. The church in Cant. 8.8. to help forward her little &s;i&s;ter church was willing to part with her choice materials, even beams of cedar, and &s;uch precious living &s;tones as were fit to build a &s;ilver palace. In the &s;ame book the church is &s;ometimes com|pared to a garden, &s;ometimes to an orchard, Cant. 4.12, 13. No man planteth a garden or orchard, but &s;eeketh to get the choice&s;t herbs and plants of his neighbours, and they freely impart them; nor do they account it a &s;poil to their garden and orchard, but rather a glory. Neverthe|le&s;s, we go not &s;o far, we neither &s;eek nor a&s;k the choice members of the pari&s;hes, but accept them being of|fered.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, They are not offered by the mini&s;ters, nor by the pari&s;h churches (who have mo&s;t right in them) but only by them&s;elves,</P>
<P>It may ju&s;tly be demanded, what right or what power have either the mini&s;ters or pari&s;h church over them? Not by &s;olemn church government, for that, tho' it be the firme&s;t engagement is not owned, but rejected. If it be their joining with the pari&s;h in calling and election of a mini&s;ter to &s;uch a congregation at his fir&s;t coming, there is indeed ju&s;t weight in &s;uch an engagement; nor do we judge it &s;afe for &s;uch to remove from &s;uch a mini&s;ter, unle&s;s it be upon &s;uch grounds as may ju&s;tly give him due &s;atis|faction. But if the union of &s;uch members to a pari&s;h-church, and to the mini&s;try thereof, be only by co-habi|tation within the precincts of the pari&s;h, that union, as it was founded upon human law, &s;o by human law it may ea&s;ily be relea&s;ed. Or otherwi&s;e, if a man remove his habitation, he removeth al&s;o the bond of his relation, and the ground of offence.</P>
<P N="4">4. It need not be fear'd that all the be&s;t hearers of the be&s;t mini&s;ters, no, nor the mo&s;t of them will depart from them upon point of church government. Tho&s;e who have found the pre&s;ence and power of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t breathing in their mini&s;ters, either to their conver&s;ion or edification, will be &s;low to change &s;uch a mini&s;try of faith and holine&s;s, for the liberty of church-order. Upon which ground, and &s;undry other &s;uch like, there be, doubtle&s;s, &s;undry godly and judicious hearers in many pari&s;hes in England, that do and will prefer their relation to their mini&s;|ters
<PB N="191" REF="012626_0190_0F8B8EC0AC1C9270">
(though in a pre&s;byterial way) above the congregation|al confederation.</P>
<P N="5">5. But if all, or the mo&s;t part of the be&s;t hearers of the be&s;t mini&s;ters of pari&s;hes &s;hould depart from them, as preferring in their judgment, the congregational way, yet in ca&s;e the congregational way &s;hould prove to be of Chri&s;t, it will never grieve the holy hearts of godly mini&s;ters, that their hearers &s;hould follow Chri&s;t; yea many of them|&s;elves (upon due deliberation) will be ready to go along with them. It never grieved nor troubled <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> that his di&s;ciples departed from him to follow after Chri&s;t, John 3. But if the congregational way &s;hould prove to be, not the in&s;titution of Chri&s;t (as we take it) but the inven|tion of men, then doubtle&s;s the pre&s;byterial form (if it be of God) will &s;wallow up the other, as Mo&s;es's rod devour|ed the rods of the Egyptians. Nor will this put a nece&s;&s;ity upon both the oppo&s;ite parties to &s;hift for them&s;elves, and &s;eek to &s;upplant one another, but only it will call upon them <HI>(Aletheuein en agape)</HI> to &s;eek and follow the truth in love, to attend in faithfulne&s;s each unto his own flock, and to admini&s;ter to them all the holy things of God, and their portion of food in due &s;ea&s;on; and as for others, quietly to forbear them, and yet to in&s;truct them with meekne&s;s, that are contrary minded, leaving it to Chri&s;t (in the u&s;e of all good means) to reveal his own truth in his own time, and mean while endeavoring to keep the unity of the &s;pirit in the bond of peace, Phil. 3.15.16. Eph. 4.3.</P>
<P>To the 2d exception, that we take no cour&s;e for the gaining, and healing, and calling in of ignorant and erro|neous per&s;ons, whom we refu&s;e to receive into our churches, and &s;o exclude them from the remedy of church-di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>We conceive the receiving of them into our churches, would rather lo&s;e and corrupt our churches, than gain and heal them. A little leaven laid in a lump of dough, will &s;ooner leaven the whole lump, than the whole lump will &s;weeten it. We find it therefore &s;afer to &s;quare rough and unhewn &s;tones before they be laid into the building, rather than to hammer and hew them when they lie unevenly in the building. And accordingly two means we u&s;e to gain and call in &s;uch as are ignorant and &s;candalous.</P>
<P N="1">1. The public mini&s;try of the word, upon which they
<PB N="192" REF="012626_0191_0F8B8EC10C047A20">
are invited by coun&s;el, and required by whole&s;ome laws. And the word it is, which is the power of God to &s;alva|tion, to the calling and winning of &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="2">2. Private conference, and conviction by the elders, and other able brethren of the church, whom they do the more re&s;pectively hearken unto, when they &s;ee no hope of enjoying church-fellow&s;hip, or participation in the &s;a|craments for them&s;elves or their children, till they approve their judgments to be &s;ound and orthodox, and their lives &s;ubdued to &s;ome hope of a godly conver&s;ation. What can cla&s;&s;ical di&s;cipline, or excommunication it&s;elf do more in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The third exception wrapeth up in it a three-fold dome&s;|tical inconvenience, and each of them meet to be e&s;chewed. 1. Di&s;-union in families between each relation. 2. Di&s;|appointment of edification, for want of opportunity in the governors of families to take account of things heard by their children and &s;ervants. 3. Di&s;bur&s;ements of chargea|ble maintenance to the &s;everal churches, whereunto the &s;everal per&s;ons of their families are joined.</P>
<P>All which inconveniencies either do not fall out in con|gregational churches, or are ea&s;ily redre&s;&s;ed; for none are orderly admitted into congregational churches, but &s;uch as are well approved by good te&s;timony to be duly ob&s;ervant of family-relation: or if any otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed &s;hould creep in, they are either orderly healed, or duly removed in a way of Chri&s;t. Nor are they admitted, un|le&s;s they can give &s;ome good account of their profiting by ordinances, before the elders and brethren of the church, and much more to their parents and ma&s;ters. Godly, tu|tors in the univer&s;ity can take an account of their pupils; and godly hou&s;holders in the city can take an account of their children and &s;ervants, how they profit by the word they have heard in &s;everal churches, and that to the greater edification of the whole family, by the variety of &s;uch admini&s;trations. Bees may bring more honey and wax into the hive, when they are not limited to one garden of flowers, but may fly abroad to many.</P>
<P>Nor is any charge expected from wives, children or &s;er|vants to the maintenance of congregational churches, fur|ther than they be furni&s;hed with per&s;onal e&s;tates or livings, which may enable them to contribute of &s;uch things as they have; and not of &s;uch things as they
<PB N="193" REF="012626_0192_0F8B8EC1D4ABFA18">
have not. God accepteth not robbery for a &s;acrifice. And though a godly hou&s;holder may ju&s;tly take him&s;elf bound in con&s;cience to contribute to any &s;uch church, whereto his wife, or children, or &s;ervants do &s;tand in relation, yet that will not aggravate the burthen of his charge no more than if they were received members of the &s;ame church whereto him&s;elf is related.</P>
<P>But why do we &s;tand thus long to plead exemptions from exception? The Lord help all his faithful &s;ervants (whether pre&s;byterial or congregational) to judge and &s;hame our&s;elves before the Lord, for all our former com|pliances to greater enormities in church government, than are to be found either in the congregational or pre&s;byteri|al way; and then &s;urely either the Lord will clear up his own will to us, and &s;o frame and &s;ubdue us all to one mind and one way, (Ezek. 43.10.11.) or el&s;e we &s;hall learn to bear one anothers burthens in a &s;pirit of meekne&s;s. It will then doubtle&s;s be far from us, &s;o to atte&s;t the di&s;|cipline of Chri&s;t, as to dete&s;t the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t: &s;o to contend for the &s;eamle&s;s coat of Chri&s;t, as to crucify the living members of Chri&s;t; &s;o to divide our&s;elves about church-communion, as thro' breaches to open a wide gap for a deluge of anti-chri&s;tian, and profane malignity to &s;wallow up both church and civil &s;tate.</P>
<P>What &s;hall we &s;ay more? Is difference of church order become the in-let of all the di&s;orders in the kingdom? Hath the Lord indeed left us to &s;uch hardne&s;s of heart, that church-government &s;hall become a &s;nare to Zion (as &s;ometimes Mo&s;es was to Egypt, Exod. 20.7.) that we cannot leave conte&s;ting and contending about it, till the kingdom be de&s;troyed? Did not the Lord Je&s;us, when he dedicated his &s;ufferings for his church, and his al&s;o unto his father, make it his earne&s;t and only prayer for us in this world, that we all might be one in him? Joh. 17.20, 21, 22, 23. And it is po&s;&s;ible that he (whom the Father heard always, Joh. 11.42.) &s;hould not have this la&s;t mo&s;t &s;olemn prayer heard and granted? Or &s;hall it be granted for all the &s;aints el&s;ewhere, and not for the &s;aints in England, &s;o that among&s;t them di&s;-union &s;hall grow
<PB N="194" REF="012626_0193_0F8B8EC2B6459DA0">
even about church union and communion? If it be po&s;&s;ible for a little faith (&s;o much as a grain of mu&s;tard-&s;eed) to re|move a mountain, is it not po&s;&s;ible for &s;o much &s;trength of faith as it is, to be found in all the godly in the kingdom, to remove tho&s;e images of jealou&s;y, and to ca&s;t tho&s;e &s;tumb|ling blocks out of the way, which may hinder the free pa&s;&s;age of brotherly love among&s;t brethren? It's true in|deed, the national covenant doth ju&s;tly engage both parties faithfully to endeavor the utter extirpation of the antichri&s;|tian hierarchy; and much more of all bla&s;phemies, here|&s;ies and errors. Certainly, if congregational di&s;cipline be independent, from the inventions of men is it not much more independent from the delu&s;ions of &s;atan? What fellow&s;hip hath Chri&s;t with beliel? Light with darkne&s;s? Truth with error? The faithful Jews needed not the help of the Samaritans, to re-edify the temple of God; yea, they rejected their help when it was offered, Ezra. 4.1, 2, 3. And if the congregational way be a way of truth (as we believe) and if the brethren that walk in it be zealous of the truth, and hate every fal&s;e way (as by the rule of their holy di&s;cipline they are in&s;tructed, 2 Joh. 10.11.) then verily there is no branch in the national covenant, that engageth the covenanters to abhor either the congre|gational churches or their way; which being duly ad|mini&s;tred, do no le&s;s effectually extirpate the anti-chri&s;tian hierarchy, and all bla&s;phemies, here&s;ies, and pernicious errors, than the other way of di&s;cipline doth, which is more generally and publickly received and ratified.</P>
<P>But the Lord Je&s;us commune with all our hearts in &s;ecret, and he who is the king of his church, let him be plea&s;ed to exerci&s;e his kingly power in out &s;pirits, that &s;o his kingdom may come into our churches in purity and peace, AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the form of church government; and that it is one, immutable, and pre&s;cribed in the word.</HEAD>
<P>ECcle&s;ia&s;tical polity, or church gevernment or di&s;ci|pline, is nothing el&s;e but that form and order that is to be ob&s;erved in the church of Chri&s;t upon earth, both for the con&s;titution of it, and all the admini&s;trations that therein are to be performed. Ezek. 43.11. Col. 2.5. 1 Tim. 3.15.</P>
<P N="2">2. Church government is con&s;idered in a double re&s;pect, either in regard of the parts of government them&s;elves, or nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tances thereof. The parts of govern|ment are pre&s;cribed in the word, becau&s;e the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the King and lawgiver of his church, is no le&s;s faithful in the hou&s;e of God than was Mo&s;es, who from the Lord delivered a form and pattern of government to the children of I&s;rael in the old Te&s;tament; and the holy &s;criptures are now al&s;o &s;o perfect, as that they are able to make the man of God perfect, and throughly furni&s;hed unto every good work; and therefore doubtle&s;s to the well ordering of the hou&s;e of God. Heb. 3.5, 6. Exod. 25.40. 2 Tim. 3.16.</P>
<P N="3">3. The parts of church-government, are all of them ex|actly de&s;cribed in the word of God, being parts or means of in&s;tituted wor&s;hip, according to the &s;econd command|ment and therefore to continue one and the &s;ame unto the appearing of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as a kingdom that cannot be &s;haken, until he &s;hall deliver it up unto God, even to the father. So that it is not left in the power of men, officers, churches, or any &s;tate in the world to add or dimini&s;h, or alter any thing in the lea&s;t mea&s;ure therein. 1 Tim. 3.15. 1 Chron. 15.13. Exod 20.4. 1 Tim. 6.13, 16. Heb. 12.27, 28. 1 Cor. 15.24. Deut. 12.32.</P>
<P N="4">4. The nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tances, as time and place, &amp;c. belonging unto order and decency, are not &s;o left unto men, as that under pretence of them they may thru&s;t their own inventions upon the churches, being circum&s;cribed in the word with many general limitations, where they are de|termined in re&s;pect of the matter, to be neither wor&s;hip

In re&s;pect of the manner, decently and in order, according to the nature of the things them&s;elves, and civil and church cu&s;tom. Doth not even nature it&s;elf teach you? Yea, they are in &s;ome &s;ort determined particularly, namely, that they be done in &s;uch a manner, as all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, is mo&s;t expedient for edification: So, as if there be no er|ror of man concerning their determination, the determin|ing of them is to be accounted as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> were divine.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the nature of the catholic church in general, and in &s;pecial of a particular vi&s;ible church.</HEAD>
<P>THE catholic church is the whole company of tho&s;e that are elected, redeemed, and in time effectually called from the &s;tate of &s;in and death, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto a &s;tate of grace and &s;alvation in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Eph. 1.22, 23. and 5.25, 26, 30.</P>
<P N="2">2. This church is either triumphant or militant. Tri|umphant, the number of them who are glorified in hea|ven: Militant, the number of them who are conflicting with their enemies upon earth. Heb. 12, 23. Rom. 8.17. 2 Tim. 2.12. and 4.8. Eph. 6.12, 13.</P>
<P N="3">3. This militant church is to be con&s;idered as invi&s;ible, and vi&s;ible. Invi&s;ible, in re&s;pect of their relation wherein they &s;tand to Chri&s;t, as a body unto the head, being united unto him by the &s;pirit of God, and faith in their hearts. Vi&s;ible, in re&s;pect of the profe&s;&s;ion of their faith, in their per&s;ons and in particular churches. And &s;o there may be acknowledged an univer&s;al vi&s;ible church. 2 Tim. 2.19. Rev. 2.17. 1 Cor. 6.17. Eph. 3.17. Rom. 1.8. 1 The&s;&s;. 1.8. I&s;a. 2.2. 1 Tim. 6.12.</P>
<P N="4">4. The members of the vi&s;ible militant church con&s;ider|ed either as not yet in church order, or walking accord|ing
<PB N="197" REF="012626_0196_0F8B8EC4DD7E7210">
to the church order of the go&s;pel. In order, and &s;o be&s;ides the &s;piritual union and communion common to believers, they enjoy moreover an union and communion eccle&s;ia&s;tical-political. So we deny an univer&s;al vi&s;ible church. Acts 19.1. Col. 2.5. Mat. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.12.</P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;tate of the members of the militant vi&s;ible church walking in order, was either before the law, oeco|nomical, that is in families; or under the law national; or &s;ince the coming of Chri&s;t, only congregational.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the matter of the vi&s;ible church, both is re&s;pect of quali|ty and quantity.</HEAD>
<P>THE matter of a vi&s;ible church are &s;aints by calling. 1 Cor. 1.2. Eph. 1.1.</P>
<P N="2">2. By &s;aints, we under&s;tand, 1. Such as have not only attained the knowledge of the principles of religion, and are free from gro&s;s and open &s;candals, but al&s;o do together with the profe&s;&s;ion of their faith and repentance, walk in blamele&s;s obedience to the word, &s;o as that in chari|table di&s;cretion they may be accounted &s;aints by calling, (though perhaps &s;ome or more of them be un&s;ound and hy|pocrites inwardly) becau&s;e the members of &s;uch particular churches are commonly by the Holy Gho&s;t called &s;aints &amp; faithful brethren in Chri&s;t; and &s;undry churches have been reproved for receiving and &s;uffering &s;uch per&s;ons to con|tinue in fellow&s;hip among&s;t them, as have been offen&s;ive and &s;candalous; the name of God al&s;o by this means is

bla&s;phemed, and the holy things of God defiled and pro|faned, the hearts of the godly grieved, and the wicked them&s;elves hardened, and holpen forward to damnation. The example of &s;uch doth endanger the &s;anctity of others: A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. 2. The chil|dren of &s;uch, who are al&s;o holy. Heb. 6.1. 1 Cor. 1.5. Rom. 6.17. 1 Cor. 1.2. Phil. 1.2. Col. 1.2. Eph. 1.1. 1 Cor. 5.12, 13. Rev. 2.14.15, 20. Ezek. 44.7, 9, and 23.38, 39. Num. 19.20. Hag. 2.13, 14. 1 Cor. 11.27.29. P&s;al. 37.21. 1 Cor. 5.6. 2 Cor. 7.14.</P>
<P N="3">3. The members of churches, though orderly con&s;ti|tuted, may in time degenerate, and grow corrupt and &s;candalous, which though they ought not to be tolerated in the church, yet their continuance therein, through the defect of the execution of di&s;cipline and ju&s;t cen&s;ures, doth not immediately di&s;&s;olve the being of a church, as appears in the church of I&s;rael, and the churches of Galatia and Corinth, Pergamus and Thyatira. Jer. 2.21. 1 Cor. 5.12. Jer. 2.4. Gal. 5.4. 2 Cor. 12.21. Rev. 2.14, 15. and 21.21.</P>
<P N="4">4. The matter of the church in re&s;pect of its quantity, ought not to be of greater number than may ordinarily meet together conveniently in one place; nor ordinarily fewer, than may conveniently carry on church-work. Hence when the holy &s;cripture makes mention of the &s;aints combined into a church e&s;tate, in a town or city where was but one congregation, it u&s;ually calleth tho&s;e &s;aints (the church) in the &s;ingular number; as, the church of the The&s;&s;alonians; the church of Smyrna, Philadelphia, and the like: But when it &s;peaketh of the &s;aints in a nation or province, wherein there were &s;undry congregations, it frequently and u&s;ually calleth them by the name of chur|ches, in the plural number, as the churches of A&s;ia, Gala|tia, Macedonia, and the like; which is further confirm|ed by what is written of &s;undry of tho&s;e churches in par|ticular, how they were a&s;&s;embled and met together, the whole church in one place, as the church at Jeru&s;alem, the church at Antioch, the church at Corinth, and Cenchrea, though it were more near to Corinth, it being the port thereof, and an&s;werable to a village, yet being a di&s;tinct congregation from Corinth, it had a church of its own, as well as Corinth had. 1 Cor. 14.21. Mat. 18.17. Rom.

<P N="5">5. Nor can it with rea&s;on be thought but that every church appointed and ordained by Chri&s;t, had a mini&s;try ordained and appointed for the &s;ame; and yet plain it is, that there were no ordinary officers appointed by Chri&s;t for any other than congregational churches; elders being appointed to feed, not all flocks, but the particular flock of God, over which the Holy Gho&s;t had made them over|&s;eers, and that flock they mu&s;t attend, even the whole flock; and one congregation being as much as any ordinary elder can attend, therefore there is no greater church than a congregation, which may ordinarily meet in one place.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the form of a vi&s;ible church, and of church-covenant.</HEAD>
<P>SAINTS by calling mu&s;t have a vi&s;ible political union among them&s;elves, or el&s;e they are not yet a particu|lar church, as tho&s;e &s;imilitudes hold forth, which the &s;cripture makes u&s;e of to &s;hew the nature of particular churches, as a body, a building, hou&s;e, hands, eyes, feet, and other members mu&s;t be united, or el&s;e (remaining &s;e|parate) are not a body. Stones, timber, though &s;quared, hewn and poli&s;hed, are not a hou&s;e, until they are com|pacted and united; &s;o &s;aints or believers in judgment of charity, are not a church, unle&s;s orderly knit together. 1 Cor. 12.27. 1 Tim. 3.15. Eph. 2.22. 1 Cor. 12.15, 16, 17. Rev. 1.</P>
<P N="2">2. Particular churches cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed one from another, but by their forms: <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> is not <HI>Smyrna,</HI> nor <HI>Pergamus Thyatira,</HI> but each one a di&s;tinct &s;ociety of it&s;elf, having officers of their own, which had not the charge of others; virtues of their own, for which others are not prai&s;ed; corruptions of their own, for which others are not blamed.</P>
<P N="3">3. This form is a vi&s;ible covenant, agreement or con|&s;ent, whereby they give up them&s;elves unto the Lord, to the ob&s;erving of the ordinances of Chri&s;t together in the
<PB N="200" REF="012626_0199_0F8B93254F33EC08">
&s;ame &s;ociety, which is u&s;ually called the church covenant: For we &s;ee not otherwi&s;e how members can have church power one over another mutually. The comparing of each particular church to a city, and unto a &s;pou&s;e, &s;eem|eth to conclude not only a form, but that form is by way of covenant. The covenant, as it was that which made the family of Abraham, and children of I&s;rael to be a church and people unto God, &s;o it is that which now makes the &s;everal &s;ocieties of Gentile believers to be churches in the&s;e days. Exod. 19.5, 8. Deut. 29.12, 13. Zech. 11.14. and 9.11. Eph. 2.19. 2 Cor. 11.2. Gen. 17.7. Deut. 29.12, 13. Eph. 2.12, 18.</P>
<P N="4">4. This voluntary agreement, con&s;ent or covenant, (for all the&s;e are taken here for the &s;ame) altho' the more ex|pre&s;s and plain it is, the more fully it puts us in mind of our mutual duty, and &s;tirreth us up to it, and leaveth le&s;s room for the que&s;tioning of the truth of the church e&s;tate of a company of profe&s;&s;ors, and the truth of member-&s;hip of particular per&s;ons; yet we conceive the &s;ub&s;tance of it is kept, where there is a real agreement and con&s;ent of a company of faithful per&s;ons to meet con&s;tantly together in one congregation, for the public wor&s;hip of God, and their mutual edification; which real agreement and con&s;ent they do expre&s;s by their con&s;tant practice in coming to|gether for the publick wor&s;hip of God, and by their reli|gious &s;ubjection to the ordinances of God there; the ra|ther if we con&s;ider how &s;cripture-covenants have been en|tred into, not only expre&s;sly by word of mouth, but by &s;acrifice, by hand-writing and &s;eal, and al&s;o &s;ometimes by &s;ilent con&s;ent, without any writing or expre&s;&s;ion of words at all.

<P N="5">5. This form being by mutual covenant, it followeth, it is not &s;aith in the heart, nor the profe&s;&s;ion of that faith, nor co-habitation, nor bapti&s;m. 1. Not &s;aith in the heart, becau&s;e that is invi&s;ible. 2. Not a bare profe&s;&s;ion, be|cau&s;e that declareth them no more to be members of one church than another. 3. Not co-habitation; athei&s;ts or infidels may dwell together with believers. 4. Not bap|ti&s;m, becau&s;e it pre-&s;uppo&s;eth a church e&s;tate, as circum|ci&s;ion in the old te&s;tament, which gave no being to the church, the church being before it, and in the wilderne&s;s

without it. Seals pre-&s;uppo&s;e a covenant already in be|ing. One per&s;on is a compleat &s;ubject of bapti&s;m, but one per&s;on is uncapable of being a church.</P>
<P N="6">6. All believers ought, as God giveth them opportuni|ty thereunto, to endeavour to join them&s;elves unto a par|ticular church, and that in re&s;pect of the honor of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in his example and in&s;titution, by the profe&s;&s;ed acknowledgement of, and &s;ubjection unto the order and ordinances of the go&s;pel; as al&s;o in re&s;pect of their good of communion, founded upon their vi&s;ible union, and con|tained in the promi&s;es of Chri&s;t's &s;pecial pre&s;ence in the church; whence they have fellow&s;hip with him, and in him one with another; al&s;o, for the keeping of them in the way of God's commandments, and recovering of them in ca&s;e of wandering (which all Chri&s;t's &s;heep are &s;ubject to in this life) being unable to return of them&s;elves; to|gether with the benefit of their mutual edification, and of their po&s;terity, that they may not be cut off from the privileges of the covenant. Otherwi&s;e if a believer offends, he remains di&s;titute of the remedy provided in that behalf. And &s;hould all believers neglect this duty of joining to all particular congregations, it might follow thereupon, that Chri&s;t &s;hould have no vi&s;ible political churches upon earth.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the officers of the church, and e&s;pecially of pa&s;tors and teachers.</HEAD>
<P>A Church being a company of people combined toge|ther by covenant, for the wor&s;hip of God, it ap|peareth thereby, there may be the e&s;&s;ence and be|ing of a church without any officers, &s;eeing there is both the form and matter of a church; which is implied when it is &s;aid, The apo&s;tles ordained elders in every church, Acts 14.23.</P>
<P N="2">2. Neverthele&s;s, though officers be not ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to the &s;imple being of churches, when they be called, yet ordinarily to their calling, they are, and to their well|being; and therefore the Lord Je&s;us, out of his tender com|pa&s;&s;ion, hath appointed and ordained officers, which he would not have done, if they had not been u&s;eful and needful for the church; yea, being a&s;cended into heaven, he received gifts for men, and gave gifts to men, where|of officers for the church are ju&s;tly accounted no &s;mall parts, they being to continue to the end of the world, and for the perfecting of all the &s;aints. Rom. 10.17. Jer. 3.15. 1 Cor. 12.28. Eph. 4.11. P&s;al. 68.18. Eph. 4.8, 11, and 4.12, 13.</P>

The apo&s;tles, prophets and evan|geli&s;ts as they were called extraordinarily by Chri&s;t, &s;o their office ended with them&s;elves. Whence it is that Paul directing Timothy how to carry along church ad|mini&s;trations, giveth no direction about the choice or cour&s;e of apo&s;tles, prophets or evangli&s;ts, but only of elders <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s; and when Paul was to take his la&s;t leave

of the church of Ephe&s;us, he committed the care of feed|ing the church to no other but unto the elders of that church. The like charge doth Peter commit to the elders. 1. Cor. 12.28. Eph. 4.11. Acts 8.6, 16, 19. and 11.28. Rom. 11.13. 1 Cor. 4.9. 1 Tim. 3.1, 2, 8 to 13. Tit. 1.8. Acts 20.17, 28. 1 Pet. 5.1, 2, 3.</P>
<P N="4">4. Of elders (who are al&s;o in &s;cripture called bi&s;hops) &s;ome attend chiefly to the mini&s;try of the word, as the pa&s;tors and teachers; others attend e&s;pecially unto rule, who are therefore called ruling elders. 1 Tim. 2.3. Phil. 1.1. Acts 20.17, 28. 1 Tim. 5.17.</P>
<P N="5">5. The office of pa&s;tor and teacher, appears to be di&s;|tinct.

<P>THE ruling elders office is di&s;tinct from the office of pa&s;tor and teacher. The ruling elders are not &s;o called, to exclude the pa&s;tors and teachers from ruling, becau&s;e ruling and governing is common to the&s;e

The ruling elders work is to join with the pa&s;tor and teacher in tho&s;e acts of &s;piritual rule, which are di&s;tinct from the mini&s;try of the word and &s;acraments committed to them. Of which &s;ort the&s;e be as followeth: 1.

To call the church together when there is occa&s;ion, and &s;ea&s;onably to di&s;mi&s;s them again. 3. To prepare matters in private, that in public they may be carried to an end with le&s;s trouble, and more &s;peedy di&s;patch. 4.

To prevent and heal &s;uch offences in life or in doctrine, as might corrupt the church. 8. To feed the flock of God with a word of admonition. 9.

<P N="4">4. The office therefore being limited unto the care of the temporal good things of the church, it extends not to the attendance upon, and admini&s;tration of the &s;piritual things thereof, as the word and &s;acramentss, or the like. 1 Cor. 7.17.</P>
<P N="5">5. The ordinance of the apo&s;tle, and practice of the church, commends the Lord's day as a fit time for the contribution of the &s;aints. 1 Cor. 16.1, 2, 3.</P>
<P N="6">6. The in&s;tituting of all the&s;e officers in the church, is the work of God him&s;elf, of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, of the Holy Gho&s;t; and therefore &s;uch officers as he hath not ap|pointed, are altogether unlawful either to be placed in the church, or to be retained therein, and are to be looked at as human creatures, meer inventions and appointments of men, to the great di&s;honor of Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord of his hou&s;e, the king of his church, whether popes, patriarchs, cardinals, arch-bi&s;hops, lord-bi&s;hops, arch-deacons, offici|als, commi&s;&s;aries, and the like.

Tit. 1.6 to 9. Deacons to be fitted as is directed, Acts 6.3. 1 Tim. 3.8 to 11.</P>
<P N="5">5. Officers are to be called by &s;uch churches whereunto they are to mini&s;ter. Of &s;uch moment is the pre&s;ervation of this power, that the churches exerci&s;ed it in the pre|&s;ence of the apo&s;tles. Acts 14.23. and 1.23. and 6.3, 4, 5.</P>
<P N="6">6. A church being free, cannot become &s;ubject to any, but by a free election; yet when &s;uch a people do chu&s;e any to be over them in the Lord, then do they become &s;ubject, and mo&s;t willingly &s;ubmit to their mini&s;try in the Lord, whom they have &s;o cho&s;en. Gal. 5.13. Heb. 13.17.</P>
<P N="7">7. And if the church have power to chu&s;e their officers and mini&s;ters, then in ca&s;e of manife&s;t unworthine&s;s and delinquency, they have power al&s;o to depo&s;e them: for, to open and &s;hut, to chu&s;e and refu&s;e, to con&s;titute in of|fice, and remove from office, are acts belonging to the &s;ame power. Rom. 16.17.</P>
<P N="8">8. We judge it much conducing to the well-being and communion of churches, that where it may conveniently be done, neighbour churches be advi&s;ed withal, and their help be made u&s;e of in the trial of church-officers, in order to their choice, Cant. 8.8, 9.</P>
<P N="9">9. The choice of &s;uch church-officers belongeth not to the civil magi&s;trates, as &s;uch, or dioce&s;an-bi&s;hops, or pa|trons; for of the&s;e, or any &s;uch-like, the &s;cripture is wholly &s;ilent, as having any power therein.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of ordination, and impo&s;ition of hands.</HEAD>
<P>CHURCH officers are not only to be cho&s;en by the church, but al&s;o to be ordained by impo&s;ition of hands and prayer, with which at the ordination of elders, fa&s;ting al&s;o is to be joined. Acts 13.3. and 14.23. 1 Tim. 5.22.</P>
<P N="2">2. This ordination we account nothing el&s;e but the &s;olemn putting a man into his place and office in the church, whereunto he had right before by election; being like the in&s;talling of a magi&s;trate in the common wealth. Ordination therefore is not to go before but to follow e|lection. The e&s;&s;ence and &s;ub&s;tance of the outward calling of an ordinary officer in the church, doth not con&s;i&s;t in his ordination, but in his voluntary and free election by the church, and his accepting of that election; whereupon is founded that relation between pa&s;tor and flock, between &s;uch a mini&s;ter and &s;uch a people. Ordination doth not con&s;titute an officer, nor give him the e&s;&s;entials of his of|fice. The apo&s;tles were elders without impo&s;ition of hands by men; Paul and Barnabas were officers before that impo&s;ition of hands, Acts 13.3. The po&s;terity of Levi were prie&s;ts and levites, before hands were laid on them by the children of I&s;rael. Numb. 8.10. Acts 6.5, 6. and 13.2.3. and 14.23. 1 Tim. 4.14. 1 Tim. 5.22.</P>
<P N="3">3. In &s;uch churches where there are elders, impo|&s;ition of hands in ordination, is to be performed by tho&s;e elders.</P>
<P N="4">4. In &s;uch churches where there are no elders, impo|&s;ition of hands may be performed by &s;ome of the brethren orderly cho&s;en by the church thereunto. For if the peo|ple may elect officers, which is the greater, and wherein the &s;ub&s;tance of the office doth con&s;i&s;t, they may much more (occa&s;ion and need &s;o requiring) impo&s;e hands in ordination, which is le&s;s, and but the accompli&s;hment of the other. Numb. 8.10.</P>
<P N="5">5. Neverthele&s;s, in &s;uch churches where there are no elders, and the church &s;o de&s;ire, we &s;ee not why impo&s;iti|on of hands may not be performed by the elders of other churches. Ordinary officers laid hands upon the officers
<PB N="208" REF="012626_0207_0F8B93368917D1E0">
of many churches: The pre&s;bytery at Ephe&s;us laid hands upon Timothy, an evangeli&s;t; the pre&s;bytery at Antioch laid hands upon Paul and Barnabas. 1 Tim. 4.14. Acts 13.3.</P>
<P N="6">6. Church officers are officers to one church, even that particular church over which the Holy Gho&s;t hath made them over&s;eers. In&s;omuch as elders are commanded to feed, not all flocks, but that flock which is committed to their faith and tru&s;t, and dependeth upon them. Nor can con&s;tant re&s;idence at one congregation be nece&s;&s;ary for a mini&s;ter, no, nor yet lawful, if he be not a mini&s;ter to one congregation only, but to the church univer&s;al; be|cau&s;e he may not attend one part only of the church to which he is a mini&s;ter, but he is called to attend unto all the flock. 1 Pet. 5.2. Acts 20.28.</P>
<P N="7">7. He that is clearly loo&s;ed from his office relation unto the church whereof he was a mini&s;ter, cannot be looked at as an officer, nor perform any act of office in any other church, unle&s;s he be again orderly called unto office; which when it &s;hall be, we know nothing to hin|der, but impo&s;ition of hands al&s;o in his ordination ought to be u&s;ed towards him again. For &s;o Paul the apo&s;tle re|ceived impo&s;ition of hands twice at lea&s;t from Annanias. Acts 9.17. and 13.3.</P>

<P>SUPREAM and lordly power over all the churches upon earth doth only belong unto Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is king of the church, and the head thereof. He hath the government upon his &s;houlders, and hath all power given to him both in heaven and earth. P&s;al. 2.6. Eph. 1.21, 22. I&s;a. 9.6. Matt. 28.18.</P>
<P N="2">2. A company of profe&s;&s;ed believers eccle&s;ia&s;tically confederate, as they are a church, before they have officees, and without them; &s;o even in that e&s;tate, &s;ubordinate church power, under Chri&s;t, delegated to them by him, doth belong to them in &s;uch a manner as is before expre&s;|&s;ed, chap. 5. &s;ect. 2. and as flowing from the very nature and e&s;&s;ence of a church: It being natural to all bodies, and &s;o unto a church body, to be furni&s;hed with &s;ufficient power for its own pre&s;ervation and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Acts 1.23. and 14.23. and 6.3, 4. Mat. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.4.5.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="209" REF="012626_0208_0F8B93375AA46B58">3. This government of the church is a mixt govern|ment, (and &s;o hath been acknowledged long before the term of independency was heard of) in re&s;pect of Chri&s;t, the head and king of the church, and the &s;overeign power re&s;iding in him, and exerci&s;ed by him, it is a monarchy; in re&s;pect of the body or brotherhood of the church, and power from Chri&s;t granted unto them, it re&s;embles a de|mocracy; in re&s;pect of the pre&s;bytery, and power com|mitted unto them, it is an ari&s;tocracy.

In in&s;tituting the ordi|nances of his wor&s;hip, and appointing his mini&s;ters and of|ficers for the di&s;pen&s;ing of them. 3.

<P N="5">5. The power granted by Chri&s;t unto the body of the church and brotherhood, is a prerogative or privilege which the church doth exerci&s;e. 1. In chu&s;ing their own offi|cers, whether elders or deacons. 2. In admi&s;&s;ion of their own members, and therefore there is great rea&s;on they &s;hould have power to remove any from their fellow&s;hip a|gain. Hence in ca&s;e of offence, any brother hath power to convince and admoni&s;h an offending brother; and in ca&s;e of not hearing him, to take one or two more to &s;et on the admonition; and in ca&s;e of not hearing them, to proceed to tell the church; and as his offence may require, the whole church hath power to proceed to the cen&s;ure of him, whether by ad|monition or excommunication; and upon his repentance, to re&s;tore him again unto his former communion. Acts 3.5. and 14.23. and 9.26. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. Tit. 3.10. Col. 4.17. 2 Cor. 2.7, 8.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="210" REF="012626_0209_0F8B93381158E718">6.

Col. 4.17. Rom. 16.17. Mat. 18.17.</P>
<P N="7">7. Church government or rule, is placed by Chri&s;t in the officers of the church, who are therefore called rulers&punc; while they rule with God; yet in ca&s;e of male admini&s;tra|tion, they are &s;ubject to the power of the church, as hath been &s;aid before. The Holy Gho&s;t frequently, yea al|ways, where it mentioneth church rule, and church govern|ment, a&s;cribeth it to elders; whereas the work and duty of the people is expre&s;&s;ed in the phra&s;e of obeying their elders, and &s;ubmitting them&s;elves unto them in the Lord. So as it is manife&s;t, that an organic or com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oat church is a body politic, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome that are governors, and &s;ome that are governed in the Lord. 1 Tim. 5.17.

<P N="8">8. The power which Chri&s;t has committed to the el|ders, is to feed and rule the church of God, and according|ly to call the church together upon any weighty occa&s;ion; when the members, &s;o called, without a ju&s;t cau&s;e, may not refu&s;e to come, nor when they are come, depart be|fore they are di&s;mi&s;s'd, nor &s;peak in the church before they have leave from the elders; nor continue &s;o doing when they require &s;ilence; nor may they oppo&s;e nor contradict the judgment or &s;entence of the elders, without &s;ufficient and weighty cau&s;e, becau&s;e &s;uch practices are manife&s;tly contrary unto order and government, and in-lets of di&s;tur|bances, and tend to confu&s;ion. Acts 20.28. and 6.2. Num. 16.12. Ezek. 46.10. Acts 13.15. Ho&s;. 4.4.</P>
<P N="9">9. It belongs al&s;o unto the elders to examine any offi|cers or members before they be received of the church; to receive the accu&s;ations brought to the church, and to prepare them for the churches hearing. In handling of offences, and other matters before the church, they have

power to declare and publi&s;h the coun&s;el and will of God, touching the &s;ame, and to pronounce &s;entence with con|&s;ent of the church. La&s;tly, They have power, when they di&s;mi&s;s the people, to ble&s;s them in the name of the Lord. Rev. 2.2. 1 Tim. 5.19. Acts 21.18, 22, 23. 1 Cor. 5.4, 5. Numb. 6. 23 to 26.</P>
<P N="10">10. This power of government in the elders doth not any wi&s;e prejudice the power of privilege in the brother|hood; as neither the power of privilege in the brethren doth prejudice the power of government in the elders, but they may &s;weetly agree together; as we may &s;ee in the ex|ample of the apo&s;tles, furni&s;hed with the greate&s;t church power, who took in the concurrence and con&s;ent of the brethren in church admini&s;trations. Al&s;o that &s;cripture, 2 Cor. 2.9. and 10.6. do declare, That what the churches are to act and do in the&s;e matters they were to do in a way of obedience, and that not only to the directi|on of the apo&s;tles, but al&s;o of their ordinary elders. Acts 14.15, 23, and 6.2. 1 Cor. 5.4. 2 Cor. 26.7. Heb. 13.17.</P>
<P N="11">11. From the premi&s;es, namely, That the ordinary power of government belonging only to the elders, power of privilege remaineth with the brotherhood (as the power of judgment in matters of cen&s;ure, and power of liberty in matters of liberty) it followeth, that in an organic church and right admini&s;tration, all church acts proceed after the manner of a mixt admini&s;tration, &s;o as no church act can be con&s;ummated or perfected without the con&s;ent of both.</P>

<P>THE apo&s;tle concludes, that nece&s;&s;ary and &s;uffici|ent maintenance is due unto the mini&s;ters of the word, from the law of nature and nations, from the law of Mo&s;es, the equity thereof, as al&s;o the rule of common rea&s;on. Moreover, the &s;cripture doth not only

call elders, labourors and workmen, but al&s;o &s;peaking of them doth &s;ay, that the labourer is worthy of his hire; and requires, that he which is taught in the word &s;hould communicate to him in all good things; and mentions it as an ordinance of the Lord, that they which preach the go&s;pel &s;hould live of the go&s;pel; and forbiddeth the muz|ling the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn, 1 Cor. 9.14, 15. Mat. 9.38. and 10.10. 1 Tim. 5.18. Gal. 6.6. 1 Cor. 9.9, 14.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;criptures alledged, requiring this maintenance as a bounden duty, and due debt, and not as a matter of alms and free gift, therefore people are not at liberty to do or not to do, what and when they plea&s;e in this mat|ter, no more than in any other commanded duty, and or|dinance of the Lord; but ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">duty to mini&s;ter of their carnal things, to them that labour among them in the word and doctrine, as well as as they ought to pay any other workmen their wages, and to di&s;charge and &s;atisfy their other debts, or to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to ob&s;erve any other ordinance of the Lord, Rom. 15.27. 1 Cor. 9.21.</P>
<P N="3">3. The apo&s;tle (Gal. 6.6.) enjoining, that he which is taught communicateth to them that teacheth in all good things, doth not leave it arbitrary, what or how much a man &s;hall give, or in what proportion, but even the latter as well as the former, is pre&s;cribed and appointed by the Lord, 1 Cor. 16.2.</P>
<P N="4">4. Not only members of churches, but all that are taught in the word, are to contribute unto him that teach|eth in all good things. In ca&s;e that congregations are defective in their contributions, the deacons are to call upon them to do their duty: if their call &s;ufficeth not, the church by her power is to require it of their members; and where church power, through the corruption of men, doth not or cannot attain the end, the magi&s;trate is to &s;ee that the mini&s;try be duly provided for, as appears from the commended example of Nehemiah. The magi&s;trates are nur&s;ing fathers, and nur&s;ing mothers, and &s;tand charg|ed with the cu&s;tody of both tables; becau&s;e it is better to prevent a &s;candal that it may not come, and ea&s;ier al&s;o, than to remove it when it is given.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of the admi&s;&s;ion of members into the church.</HEAD>
<P>THE doors of the churches of Chri&s;t upon earth do not by God's appointment &s;tand &s;o wide open, that all &s;orts of people, good or bad, may freely enter therein at their plea&s;ure, but &s;uch as are admitted thereto, as members, ought to be examined and tried fir&s;t, whether they be fit and meet to be received, into church-&s;ociety or not. The eunuch of Ethiopia, before his ad|mi&s;&s;ion was examined by Philip, whether he did believe on Je&s;us Chri&s;t with all his heart. The angel of the church at Ephe&s;us is commended for trying &s;uch as &s;aid they were apo&s;tles, and were not. There is like rea&s;on for trying of them that profe&s;s to be believers. The of|ficers are charged with the keeping of the doors of the church, and therefore are in a &s;pecial manner to make tryal of the fitne&s;s of &s;uch who enter. Twelve angels are &s;et at the gates of the temple, le&s;t &s;uch as where cere|monially unclean &s;hould enter thereinto. 2 Chron. 23.19. Mat. 13.25. and 22.12. Acts 8.37. Rev. 2.2. Acts 9.26. Rev. 21.12. 2 Chro. 23.19.</P>
<P N="2">2. The things which are requi&s;ite to be found in all church members, are repentance from &s;in, and faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and the&s;e are the things whereof men are to be examined at their admi&s;&s;ion into the church, and which then they mu&s;t profe&s;s and hold forth in &s;uch &s;ort, as may &s;atisfy rational charity that the things are there indeed. John Bapti&s;t admitted men to bapti&s;m confe&s;&s;ing and be|wailing their &s;ins; and of others it is &s;aid, That they came and confe&s;&s;ed and &s;hewed their deeds. Acts 2.38 to 42. and 8.37. Mat. 3.6. Acts 1.9, 18.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="214" REF="012626_0213_0F8B933AFA780098">3. The weake&s;t mea&s;ure of faith is to be accepted in tho&s;e that de&s;ire to be admitted into the church, becau&s;e weak chri&s;tians, if &s;incere, have the &s;ub&s;tance of that faith, repentance and holine&s;s which is required in church mem|bers; and &s;uch have mo&s;t need of the ordinances for their confirmation and growth in grace. The Lord Je&s;us would not quench the &s;moaking flax, not break the brui&s;ed reed, but gather the tender lambs in his arms, and carry them gently in his bo&s;om. Such charity and tenderne&s;s is to be u&s;ed, as the weake&s;t chri&s;tian, if &s;incere, may not be ex|cluded nor di&s;couraged. Severity of examination is to be avoided. Rom. 14.1. Mat. 12.20. I&s;a. 40.11.</P>
<P N="4">4. In ca&s;e any through exce&s;&s;ive fear, or other infirmi|ty, be unable to make their per&s;onal relation of their &s;piri|tual e&s;tate in public, it is &s;ufficient that the elders having received private &s;atisfaction, make relation thereof in pub|lic before the church, they te&s;tifying their a&s;&s;ents thereun|to; this being the way that tendeth mo&s;t to edification. But where per&s;ons are of great abilities, there it is mo&s;t expedient that they make their relations and confe&s;&s;ions per&s;onally with their own mouth, as David profe&s;&s;eth of him&s;elf, P&s;al. 66.16.</P>
<P N="5">5. A per&s;onal and public confe&s;&s;ion, and declaring of God's manner of working upon the &s;oul, is both lawful, expedient and u&s;eful, in &s;undry re&s;pects, and upon &s;undry grounds. Tho&s;e three thou&s;and, Acts 2.37, 41. before they were admitted by the apo&s;tles, did manife&s;t that they were pricked in the heart at Peter's &s;ermon, together with earne&s;t de&s;ire to be delivered from their &s;ins, which now wounded their con&s;cience, and their ready receiving of the word of promi&s;e and exhortation. We are to be ready to render a rea&s;on of the hope that is in us, to every one that a&s;keth us; therefore we mu&s;t be able and ready upon any occa&s;ion to declare and &s;hew our repentence for &s;in, faith unfeigned, and effectual calling, becau&s;e the&s;e are the rea&s;ons of a well grounded hope.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of church members their removal from one church to another, and of recommendation and di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>CHURCH members may not remove or depart from the church, and &s;o one from another as they plea&s;e, nor without ju&s;t and weighty cau&s;e, but ought to live and dwell together, fora&s;much as they are command|ed not to for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling them&s;elves together. Such departure tends to the di&s;&s;olution and ruin of the body, as the pulling of &s;tones and pieces of timber from the build|ing, and of members from the natural body tends to the de&s;truction of the whole. Heb. 10.25.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is therefore the duty of church-members in &s;uch times and places where council may be had, to con&s;ult with the church whereof they are members about their removal, that accordingly they having their approbation, may be encouraged or otherwi&s;e de&s;i&s;t. They who are joined with con&s;ent, &s;hould not depart without con&s;ent, except forced thereunto. Pro. 11.16.</P>
<P N="3">3. If a member's departure be manife&s;tly un&s;afe and &s;inful, the church may not con&s;ent thereunto; for in &s;o doing, they &s;hould not act in faith, and &s;hould partake with him in his &s;in. If the ca&s;e be doubtful, and the per|&s;on not to be per&s;waded, it &s;eemeth be&s;t to leave the mat|ter unto God, and not forcibly to detain him. Rom. 14.23. 1 Tim. 5.22. Acts 21.14.</P>
<P N="4">4. Ju&s;t rea&s;ons for a member's removal of him&s;elf from the church, are, 1. If a man cannot continue without partaking in &s;in. 2. In ca&s;e of per&s;onal per&s;ecution; &s;o Paul departed from the di&s;ciples at Dama&s;cus. Al&s;o in ca&s;e of general per&s;ecution, when all are &s;cattered. 5. In ca&s;e of real, and not only pretended want of competent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, a door being opened for better &s;upply in ano|ther place, together with the means of &s;piritual edification. In the&s;e or like ca&s;es, a member may lawfully remove, and the church, cannot lawfully detain him. Eph. 5.11. Acts 9.25, 29, 30. and 8.1. Neh. 13.20.</P>
<P N="5">5. To &s;eperate from a church, either out of contempt of their holy fellow&s;hip, or out of covetou&s;ne&s;s, or for
<PB N="217" REF="012626_0216_0F8B933E26C93300">
greater enlargements, with ju&s;t grief to the church; or out of &s;chi&s;m, or want of love, and out of a &s;pirit of con|tention, in re&s;pect of &s;ome unkindne&s;s, or &s;ome evil only conceived, or indeed in the church, which might and &s;hould be tolerated and healed with a &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, and of which evil the church is not yet convinced (tho' perhaps him&s;elf be) nor admoni&s;hed; for the&s;e or the like rea&s;ons to withdraw from public communion in word, or &s;eals, or cen&s;ures, is unlawful and &s;inful. 2 Tim. 4.10. Rom. 16.17. Judge 5.19. Eph. 4.2, 3. Col. 3.13. Gal. 6.1, 2.</P>
<P N="6">6. Such members as have orderly removed their habi|tation, ought to join them&s;elves unto the church in order where they do inhabit, if it may be; otherwi&s;e, they can neither perform the duties, nor receive the privileges of members. Such an example tolerated in &s;ome, is apt to corrupt others, which if many &s;hould follow, would threa|ten the di&s;&s;olution and confu&s;ion of churches, contrary to the &s;cripture. I&s;a. 56.8. Acts 9.26. 1 Cor. 14.33.</P>
<P N="7">7. Order requires that a member thus removing, have letters te&s;timonial, and of di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the church where|of he yet is, unto the church whereunto he de&s;ireth to be joined, le&s;t the church &s;hould be deluded; that the church may receive him in the faith, and not be corrupted by re|ceiving deceivers, and fal&s;e brethren, until the per&s;on di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed be received into another church, he cea&s;eth not by his letters or di&s;mi&s;&s;ion to be a member of the church whereof he was, the church cannot make a member no member, but by excommunication. Acts 18.27.</P>
<P N="8">8. If a member be called to remove only for a time, where a church is, letters of recommendation are requi&s;ite, and &s;ufficient for communion with that church, in the or|dinances, and in their watch; as Phoebe, a &s;ervant of the church at Cenchrea, had letters written for her to the church at Rome, that &s;he might be received as becometh &s;aints. Rom. 16.1, 2. 2 Cor. 3, 1.</P>
<P N="9">9. Such letters of recommendation and di&s;mi&s;&s;ion were written for Apollos, for Marcus to the Colo&s;&s;ians; for Phoebe to the Romans, for &s;undry others to other churches.
<PB N="218" REF="012626_0217_0F8B933EC1767B30">
And the apo&s;tle telleth us, that &s;ome per&s;ons, not &s;uffici|ently known otherwi&s;e, have &s;pecial need of &s;uch letters, though he for his part had no need thereof. The u&s;e of them is to be a benefit and help to the party for whom they are written, and for the furthering of his receiving among&s;t the &s;aints in the place whereto he goeth, and the due &s;atisfaction of them in their receiving of him.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Of excommunication, and other cen&s;ures.</HEAD>
<P>THE cen&s;ures of the church are appointed by Chri&s;t for the preventing, removing, and healing of of|fences in the church; for the reclaiming and gain|ing of offending brethren, for the deterring others from the like offences, for purging out the leaven which may infect the whole lump; for vindicating the honor of Chri&s;t, and of his church, and the holy profe&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel; and for preventing of the wrath of God, that may ju&s;tly fall upon the church, if they &s;hould &s;uffer his covenant, and the &s;eals thereof to be profaned by notorious and ob&s;tinate offenders. 1 Tim. 5.20. Deut. 17.12, 13. Jude 5.19. Deut. 13.11. 1 Cor. 5.6. Rom. 2.24. Rev. 2.14, 15, 16, 20.</P>
<P N="2">2. If an offence be private, (one brother offending another) the offender is to go and acknowledge his repen|tance for it unto his offended brother, who is then to for|give him; but if the offender neglect or refu&s;e to do it, the brother offended is to go and convince and admoni&s;h him of it, between them&s;elves privately: If thereupon the offender be brought to repent of his offence, the admo|ni&s;her hath won his brother; but if the offender hear not his brother, the brother offended is to take with him one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es every word may be e&s;tabli&s;hed, (whether the word of ad|monition, if the offender receive it; or the word of com|plaint, if he refu&s;e it;) for if he refu&s;e it, the offended brother is by the mouth of the elders to tell the church, and if he hear the church, and declare the &s;ame by peni|tent
<PB N="219" REF="012626_0218_0F8B933F84CBE7C0">
confe&s;&s;ion, he is recovered and gained; and if the church di&s;cern him to be willing to hear, yet not fully con|vinced of his offence, as in ca&s;e of here&s;ie, they are to di&s;|pen&s;e to him a public admonition; which declaring the offender to lie under the public offence of the church, doth thereby withold or &s;u&s;pend him from the holy fellow&s;hip of the Lord's &s;upper, till his offence be removed by peni|tent confe&s;&s;ion. If he &s;till continue o&s;t&s;tinate, they are to ca&s;t him out by excommunication. Mat. 5.23, 24. Luke 17.3, 4. Mat. 18.15, 26, 17. Tit. 3.10.</P>
<P N="3">3. But if the offence be more public at fir&s;t, and of a more heinous and criminal nature, to wit, &s;uch as are con|demned by the light of nature, then the church, without &s;uch gradual proceedings, is to ca&s;t out the offender from their holy communion, for the further mortifying of his &s;ins, and the healing of his &s;oul in the day of the Lord Je&s;us. 1 Cor. 5.4, 5, 11.</P>
<P N="4">4. In dealing with an offender, great care is to be ta|ken, that we be neither over &s;trict or rigorous, nor too in|dulgent or remi&s;s; our proceeding herein, ought to be with a &s;pirit of meckne&s;s, con&s;idering our&s;elves, lea&s;t we al&s;o be tempted; and that the be&s;t of us have need of much forgivene&s;s from the Lord. Yet the winning and healing of the offender's &s;oul, being the end of the&s;e en|deavors, we mu&s;t not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ub with untempered mortar, nor heal the wounds of our brethren &s;ligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly. On &s;ome have compa&s;&s;ion, others &s;ave with fear. Gal. 6.1. Mat. 18.34, 35. Ezek. 13.10.</P>
<P N="5">5. While the off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nder remains excommunicate, the church is to refrain all member-like communion with him in &s;piritual things, and al&s;o from all familiar communion with him in civil things, further than the nece&s;&s;ity of na|tural, dome&s;tical or civil relations do require; and are therefore to forbear to eat and drink with him, that he may be a&s;hamed. Mat. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.11. 2 The&s;. 3.6, 14.</P>
<P N="6">6. Excommunication being a &s;piritual puni&s;hment, it doth not prejudice the excommunicate in, nor deprive him of his civil rights, and therefore toucheth not princes, nor other magi&s;trates in point of their civil dignity or autho|rity, and the excommunicate being but as a publican, and a heathen, (heathens being lawfully permitted to come to

<P N="7">7. If the Lord &s;anctify the cen&s;ure to the offender, &s;o as by the grace of Chri&s;t he doth te&s;tify his repentance with humble confe&s;&s;ion of his &s;ins, and judging of him&s;elf, giving glory unto God, the church is then to forgive him, and to comfort him, and to re&s;tore him to the wonted brotherly communion, which formerly he enjoyed with them, 2 Cor. 2.7, 8.</P>
<P N="8">8. The &s;uffering of the prophane or &s;candalous livers to continue in fellow&s;hip, and partake in the &s;acraments, is doubtle&s;s a great &s;in in tho&s;e that have power in their hands to redre&s;s it, and do it not: Neverthele&s;s, ina&s;|much as Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles in their times, and the prophets and the other godly in theirs, did lawfully par|take of the Lord's commanded ordinances in the Jewi&s;h church, and neither taught nor practi&s;ed &s;eparation from the &s;ame, though unworthy ones were permitted therein, and ina&s;much as the faithful in the church of Corinth, wherein were many unwor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hy per&s;ons and practices, are never commanded to ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the &s;acraments, becau&s;e of the &s;ame; therefore the godly in like ca&s;es are not pre&s;ently to &s;eparate, Rev. 2.14, 15, 20. Mat. 23.3. Acts 3.1. 1 Cor. 6. and 15.12.</P>
<P N="9">9. As &s;eparation from &s;uch a church wherein prophane and &s;candalous per&s;ons are tolerated, is not pre&s;ently ne|ce&s;&s;ary; &s;o for the members thereof, otherwi&s;e unworthy, hereupon to ab&s;tain from communicating with &s;uch a church in the participation of the &s;acraments is unlawful. For as it were unrea&s;onable for an innocent per&s;on to be puni&s;hed for the faults of others, wherein he hath no hand, and whereunto he gave no con&s;ent; &s;o is it more unrea|&s;onable, that a godly man &s;hould neglect duty, and puni&s;h him&s;elf, in not coming for his portion in the ble&s;&s;ing of the &s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, as he ought, becau&s;e others are &s;uffered to come, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t ought no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; e&s;pecially con&s;idering that him&s;elf doth neither con&s;ent to their &s;ins, nor to their approaching to the ordinance in their &s;in, nor to the neglect of others

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Of the communion of churches one with another.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH churches be di&s;tinct and therefore may not be confounded one with another, and equal, and therefore have not dominion one over another; yet all the churches ought to pre&s;erve church communion one with another, becau&s;e they are all united unto Chri&s;t, not only as a my&s;tical but as a political head, whence is derived a communion &s;uitable thereunto. Rev. 1.4. Cant. 8.8. Rom. 16.16. 1 Cor. 16.19. Acts 15.23. Rev. 2.1.</P>
<P N="2">2. The communion of churches is excerci&s;ed &s;undry ways. 1. By way of mutual care, in taking thought for one anothers welfare. 2. By way of con&s;ultation one with another, when we have occa&s;ion to require the judg|ment and coun&s;el of other churches, touching any per&s;on or cau&s;e wherewith they may be better acquainted than our|&s;elves. As the church at Antioch con&s;ulted with the apo&s;tles and elders of the church at Jeru&s;alem, about the que&s;tion of circumci&s;ion of the Gentiles, and about the fal&s;e teachers that broached that doctrine. In which ca&s;e, when any church wanted light or peace among&s;t them&s;elves, it is a way of communion of churches (according to the word) ta meet together, by their elders and other me&s;&s;engers in a &s;ynod, to con&s;ider and argue the points in doubt or dif|ference; and having found out the way of truth and peace, to commend the &s;ame by their let<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and me&s;&s;engers to
<PB N="222" REF="012626_0221_0F8B9341D9085B10">
the churches whom the &s;ame may concern. But if a church be rent with divi&s;ions among them&s;elves, or lie under any open &s;candal, and yet refu&s;e to con&s;ult with other churches for healing or removing of the &s;ame, it is matter of ju&s;t offence both to the Lord Je&s;us, and to other churches, as bewraying too much want of mercy and faithfulne&s;s, not to &s;eek to bind up the breaches and wounds of the church and brethren; and therefore the &s;tate of &s;uch a church calleth aloud upon o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her churches to exerci&s;e a fuller act of brotherly communion, to wit, by way of admonition. 3. A third way of communion of churches is by way of admonition, to wit, in ca&s;e any public offence be found in a church, which either di&s;cern not or are &s;low in proceed|ing to u&s;e means for the removing and healing thereof. Paul had no authority over Peter, yet when he &s;aw Peter not walking with a right foot, he publickly rebuked him before the church. Though churches have no more authority one over another, than one apo&s;tle had over ano|ther, yet as one apo&s;tle might admoni&s;h another, &s;o may one church admoni&s;h another, and yet without u&s;ur|pation. In which ca&s;e, if the church that lieth under offence, do not hearken to the church that doth admoni&s;h her, the church is to acquaint other neighbour churches with that offence which the offending church &s;till lieth un|der, together with the neglect of their brotherly admoni|tion given unto them; whereupon tho&s;e other churches are to join in &s;econding the admonition formerly given; and if &s;till the offending church continue in ob&s;tina|cy and impenitency, they may forbear communion with them, and are to proceed to make u&s;e of the help of a &s;ynod, or council of neighbour churches walking orderly (if a greater cannot conveniently be had) for their con|viction. If they hear not the &s;ynod, the &s;ynod having de|clared them too ob&s;tinate, particular churches approving and accepting the judgment of the &s;ynod, are to declare the &s;entence of non-communion re&s;pectively concerning them; and thereupon, out of a religious care to keep their own communion pure, they may ju&s;tly withdraw them&s;elves from participation with them at the Lord's table, and from &s;uch other acts of holy communion as the communi|on of churches doth otherwi&s;e allow and require. Never|thele&s;s, if any members of &s;uch a church as live under
<PB N="223" REF="012626_0222_0F8B93428A88A3D8">
public offence, do not con&s;ent to the offence of the church, but do in due &s;ort bear witne&s;s again&s;t it, they are &s;till to be received to wonted communion; for it is not equal that the innocent &s;hould &s;uffer with the offen&s;ive. Yea, furthermore, if &s;uch innocent members, after due waiting in the u&s;e of all good means for the healing of the offence of their own church, &s;hall at l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t (with the allowance of the council of neighbour churches) withdraw from the fellow|&s;hip of their own church, and offer them&s;elves to the fel|low&s;hip of another, we judge it lawful for the other church to receive them (being otherwi&s;e fit) as if they had been orderly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to them from their own church. 4. A fourth w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of communion of churches is by way of parti|cipation. The members of one church occa&s;ionally coming to another, we willingly admit them to partake with us at the Lord's table, it being the &s;eal of our communion, not only with Chri&s;t, nor only with the members of our own churches, but al&s;o of all the churches of the &s;aints; in which regard we refu&s;e not to baptize their children pre&s;ented to us, if either their own mini&s;ter, be ab&s;ent, or &s;uch a fruit of holy fellow&s;hip be de&s;ired with us. In like ca&s;e, &s;uch churches as are furni&s;hed with more mini&s;ters than one, do willingly afford one of their own mini&s;ters to &s;upply the place of an ab&s;ent or &s;ick mini&s;ter of another church for a needful &s;ea&s;on. 5. A fifth way of church communion, is by way of recommendation, when the member of one church hath occa&s;ion to re&s;ide in another church, if but for a &s;ea&s;on, we commend him to their watchful fellow&s;hip, by letters of recommendation, but if he be called to &s;ettle his abode there, we commit him according to his de&s;ire, to the fellow&s;hip of their covenant, by letters of di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. 6. A &s;ixth way of church communion is in ca&s;e of need, to mini&s;ter relief and &s;uccour one unto another, either of able members, to furni&s;h them with officers, or of outward &s;upport, to the nece&s;&s;ities of poorer churches, as did the churches of the Gentiles contribute liberally to the poor &s;aints at Jeru&s;alem. Cant. 8.8. Acts 15.2, 6, 22, 23. Ezek. 34.4. Gal. 2.11 to 14. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. by proportion. Gen. 18.25. 1 Cor. 12.13. Rom. 16.1. Acts 18.27. and 11.22, 29. Rom. 13.26, 27.</P>
<P N="3">3. When a company of believers purpo&s;e to gather in|to a church fellow&s;hip, it is requi&s;ite for their &s;afer pro|ceeding,
<PB N="224" REF="012626_0223_0F8B93434400AC68">
and the maintaining the communion of churches, that they &s;ignify their intent unto the neighbour churches, walking according unto the order of the go&s;pel, and de&s;ire their pre&s;ence, and help, and right hand of fellow&s;hip, which they ought readily to give unto them, when there is no ju&s;t cau&s;e to except again&s;t their proceedings. Gal. 2.1, 2. and 9. by proportion.</P>
<P N="4">4. Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;everal ways of communion, there is al&s;o a way of propagation of churches: when a church &s;hall grow too numerous, it is a way, and fit &s;ea&s;on to propagate one church out of another, by &s;ending forth &s;uch of their members as are willing to remove, and to procure &s;ome officers to them, as may enter with them into church e&s;tate among&s;t them&s;elves. As bees, when the hive is too full, i&s;&s;ue forth by &s;warms, and are gathered into o|ther hives, &s;o the churches of Chri&s;t may do the &s;ame upon like nece&s;&s;ity; and therein hold forth to them the right hand of fellow&s;hip, both in their gathering into a church, and in the ordination of their officers, I&s;a. 40.20.

Magi&s;trates have power to call a &s;ynod, by calling to the churches to &s;end forth their elders, and other me&s;|&s;engers, to coun&s;el, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in matters of religion; but yet the con&s;tituting of a &s;ynod is a church act, and may be tran&s;acted by the churches even when civil magi&s;trates may be enemies to the churches, and church-a&s;&s;emblies, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19.4, 5, to 11. <HI>Acts.</HI> 15.</P>
<P N="4">4. It belongeth unto &s;ynods and councils, to debate and determine controver&s;ies of faith, and ca&s;es of con&s;cience; to clear from the word holy directions for the holy wor|&s;hip of God, and good government of the church; to bear witne&s;s again&s;t male admini&s;tration and corruption in doctrine or manners in any particular church; and to give directions for the reformation thereof; not to exerci&s;e church cen&s;ures in way of di&s;cipline, nor any other act of church authority or juri&s;diction, which that pre&s;idential &s;ynod did forbear, <HI>Acts.</HI> 15.1, 2, 6, 7. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15, 13. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.6, 7. <HI>Acts</HI> 15.24, 28, 29.</P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;ynods directions and determinations &s;o far as con&s;onant to the word of God, are to be received with re|verence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; not only fort heir agreement there|with (which is the principal ground thereof, and without which they bind not at all) but al&s;o &s;econdarily for the power where by they are made, as being an ordinance of God appointed thereunto in his word, <HI>Acts</HI> 15.</P>
<P N="6">6. Becau&s;e it is difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, for many churches to come together in one place, in all their mem|bers univer&s;ally; therefore they may a&s;&s;emble by their de|legates or me&s;&s;engers; as the church at <HI>Antioch</HI> went not all to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> but &s;ome &s;elect men for that purpo&s;e. Be|cau&s;e none are or &s;hould be more fit to know the &s;tate of the churches nor to advi&s;e of ways for the good thereof, than elders; therefore it is fit that in the choice of the me&s;|&s;engers for &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies they have &s;pecial re&s;pect unto &s;uch; yet ina&s;much as not only Paul and Barnabas, but certain others al&s;o were &s;ent to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> from <HI>Antioch,</HI> and when they were come to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> not only the

apo&s;tles and elders, but other brethren al&s;o do a&s;&s;emble and meet about the matter; therefore &s;ynods are to con&s;i&s;t both of elders, and other church members endued with gifts, and &s;ent by the churches, not excluding the pre&s;ence of any brethren in the churches, <HI>Acts</HI> 15.2, 22, 23.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Of the civil magi&s;trates power in matters eccle&s;ia&s;tical.</HEAD>
<P>IT is lawful, profitable and nece&s;&s;ary for chri&s;tians to ga|ther them&s;elves together into church e&s;tate, and there|in to exerci&s;e all the ordinances of Chri&s;t, according unto the word, although the con&s;ent of the magi&s;trate could not be had thereunto; becau&s;e the apo&s;tles and chri&s;|tians in their time did frequently thus practi&s;e, when the magi&s;trates all of them being <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> or <HI>Pagan,</HI> and mo&s;t per&s;ecuting enemies, would give no countenance or con|&s;ent to &s;uch matters, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.41, 47. and 4.1, 2, 3.</P>
<P N="2">2. Church government &s;tands in no oppo&s;ition to civil government of common-wealths, nor any way intrencheth upon the authority of civil magi&s;trates in their juri&s;diction; nor any whit weakneth their hands in governing, but ra|ther &s;trengtheneth them, furthereth the people in yielding more hearty and con&s;cionable obedience unto them what&s;o|ever &s;ome ill affected per&s;ons to the ways of Chri&s;t have &s;ugge&s;ted, to alienate the affection of kings and princes from the ordinances of Chri&s;t; as if the kingdom of Chri&s;t in his church could not ri&s;e and &s;tand without the falling and weakening of their government, which is al&s;o of Chri&s;t; whereas the contrary is mo&s;t true, that they may both &s;tand together and flouri&s;h, the one being helpful unto the other, in their di&s;tinct and due admini&s;trations. <HI>John</HI> 18.36. <HI>Acts</HI> 25.8. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 49.23.</P>
<P N="3">3. The power and authority of magi&s;trates is not for the re&s;training of churches, or any other good works, but for helping in and furthering thereof; and therefore the con|&s;ent and countenance of magi&s;trates, when it may be had,
<PB N="227" REF="012626_0226_0F8B934586EE5678">
is not to be &s;lighted or lightly e&s;teemed; but on the con|tary, it is part of that honor due to chri&s;tian magi&s;trates to de&s;ire and crave there con&s;ent and approbation therein, which being obtained, the churches may then proceed in their way with more encouragement and comfort. <HI>Rom.</HI> 13, 4. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.2.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is not in the power of magi&s;trates to compel their &s;ubjects to become church members, and to partake at the Lord's table; for the prie&s;ts are reproved that brought un|worthy ones into the &s;anctuary: Then as it was unlawful for the prie&s;t, &s;o it is as unl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wful to be done by civil ma|gi&s;trates, tho&s;e whom the church ca&s;t out it they were in, the magi&s;trate ought not to thru&s;t them into the church, nor to hold them therein, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 44.7.9. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.11.</P>
<P N="5">5. As it is unlawful for church officers to meddle with the &s;word of the magi&s;trate, &s;o it is unlawful for the ma|gi&s;trate to meddle with the work proper to church officers. The acts of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> who were not only princes, but prophets, were extraordinary, therefore not imitable. Again&s;t &s;uch u&s;urpation, the Lord witne&s;&s;ed by &s;miting <HI>Uzziah</HI> with lepro&s;y, for pre&s;uming to offer incen&s;e. <HI>Mat.</HI> 2.25, 26. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 26.16, 17.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is the duty of the magi&s;trate to take care of mat|ters of religion, and to improve his civil authority for the ob&s;erving of the duties commanded in the fir&s;t, as well as for ob&s;erving of the duties commanded in the &s;econd ta|ble. They are called Gods. The end of the magi&s;trates office, is not only the quiet and peaceable life of the &s;ub|ject in matters of righteou&s;ne&s;s and hone&s;ty, but al&s;o in matters of godline&s;s. <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, David, Solomon, A&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Jeho&s;aphat, Hezekiah, Jo&s;iah,</HI> are much commended by the Holy Gho&s;t for the putting forth their authority in matters of religion: On the contrary, &s;uch kings as have been failing this way, are frequently taxed and reproved by the Lord. And not only the kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>Job, Nehemiah</HI> the king of <HI>Nineveh, Darius, Artaxerres, Nebu|chadnezzar,</HI> whom none looked at as types of Chri&s;t, (though were it &s;o, there were no place for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> objec|tion)

are commended in the book of God, for exerci&s;ing their authority this way, <HI>P&s;alm.</HI> 82.8. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.1, 2. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 15.14. and 22.43. 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 12.3. and 14, 4. and. 15.35. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 20.42. <HI>Job</HI> 29.25. and 31.26, 28. <HI>Neb.</HI> 13. <HI>Jonah</HI> 3.7. <HI>Ezra.</HI> 7. <HI>Dan.</HI> 3.29.</P>
<P N="7">7. The objects of the power of the magi&s;trate are not things meerly inward, and &s;o not &s;ubject to his cogni|zance and view, as unbelief, hardne&s;s of heart, erroneous opinions not vented, but only &s;uch things as are acted by the outward man; neither is their power to be exerci&s;ed in commanding &s;uch acts of the outward man, and puni&s;h|ing the neglect thereof; as are but meer inventions &amp; devices of men, but about &s;uch acts as are commanded and forbidden in the word; yea, &s;uch as the word doth clearly determine, though not always clearly to the judgment of the magi&s;trate or others, yet clearly in it&s;elf. In the&s;e he of right ought to put forth his authority, though oft-times actually he doth it not. 1 Kings 20.28, 42.</P>

Deut. 13. 1 King. 20.28, 42. Dan. 3.29. Zech. 13.3. Neh. 13.31. 1 Tim. 2.2. Rom. 13.4.</P>

<HEAD>A PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t witne&s;&s;ed a good confe&s;&s;i|on, at the time when he &s;aid, To this end was I born, and for this cau&s;e came I into the world, that I &s;hould bear witne&s;s unto the truth; and be taketh notice of it, to the prai&s;e and high commen|dation of the church in <HI>Pergamus,</HI> that they held fa&s;t his name, and had not denied his Faith. Nor are they worthy the name of chri&s;tians, who, though the Lord by his Provi|dence call them publickly to own the truth they have profe&s;&s;ed, &s;hall neverthele&s;s refu&s;e to declare what they believe, as to tho&s;e great and fundamental principles in the doctrine of Chri&s;t, the knowledge whereof is nece&s;&s;ary unto &s;alvation. We find how ready the apo&s;tle was to make A Confe&s;&s;ion of his Faith; though for that hope's &s;ake he was accu&s;ed and put in chains. And the martyr's of Je&s;us, who have laid down their lives in bearing witne&s;s to the truth, again&s;t the infidelity, idolatry, here&s;y, apo&s;tacy of the world, when Pa|gan, Arian, or over&s;pread with Popi&s;h darkne&s;s: Having their feet &s;hod with the preparation of the go&s;pel of peace, were free and forward in their te&s;timony, confe&s;&s;ing the truth, yea, &s;ealing it with their blood. With the heart man be|lieveth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s, and with the mouth confe&s;&s;ion is made unto &s;alvation, <HI>Rom. 10.10.</HI> Nor is there a greater evidence of being in a &s;tate of &s;alvation, than &s;uch a confe&s;&s;i|on, if made in times or places where men are expo&s;ed to utmo&s;t &s;uffering upon that account. <HI>1 John, 4.15.</HI> And if Con|fe&s;&s;ion of faith be, in &s;ome ca&s;es, of &s;uch importance and nece&s;&s;i|ty, as hath been expre&s;&s;ed; it mu&s;t needs be in it&s;elf, a work plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of God, for his &s;ervants to declare unto the world, what tho&s;e principles of truth are, which they have received, and are (by the help of Chri&s;t) purpo&s;ed to live and die in the &s;tedfa&s;t profe&s;&s;ion of. Some of the Lord's worthies have been of renown among his people in this re|&s;pect;

e&s;pecially <HI>Iraenius</HI> and <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> of old, and of latter times <HI>Beza,</HI> all who&s;e (not to mention others) Confe&s;&s;ions, with the advantage which the church of God hath received thereby, are famou&s;ly known.</P>
<P>And it mu&s;t needs tend much to the honor of the dear and ble&s;&s;ed name of the Lord Je&s;us, in ca&s;e many churches do join together in their te&s;timony. How &s;ignally the Lord hath owned the Confe&s;&s;ion of the four general Synods or Councils for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the here&s;ies of tho&s;e times, needs not to be &s;aid, &s;ince no man can be ignorant thereof, that hath made it his concern to be acquainted with things of this nature. The Confe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> of the <HI>Walden&s;es,</HI> and of the reformed prote&s;tant churches abroad, (which al&s;o, to &s;hew what harmony in re&s;pect of doctrine there is among all &s;incere profe&s;&s;ors of the truth, have been publi&s;hed in one volume) all the&s;e have been of &s;ingular u&s;e, not only to tho&s;e that lived in the ages when the&s;e declarations were emitted, but unto po&s;terity, yea, unto this day.</P>
<P>There have been &s;ome who have reflected upon the&s;e New-Engli&s;h churches for our defect in this matter, as if our prin|ciples were unknown; whereas it is well-known, that as to matters of doctrine we agree with other r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">formed churches: Nor was it that, but what concerns wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, that cau&s;ed our fathers to come into the wilderne&s;s, while it was a land not &s;own, that &s;o they might have liberty to practi&s;e accordingly. And it is a ground of holy rejoicing before the Lord, that now there is no advantage left for tho&s;e that may be di&s;&s;affected towards us, to object any thing of that nature again&s;t us. For it hath plea&s;ed the only wi&s;e God &s;o to di&s;po&s;e in his Providence, as that the elders and me&s;&s;engers of the churches in the colony of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> did, by the call and encouragement of the honored General Court, meet together <HI>Sept. 10, 1679.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the holy Scripture.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence, do &s;o far manife&s;t the good|ne&s;s, wi&s;dom and power of God, as to leave men unexcu&s;able; yet are they not &s;ufficient to give that know|ledge of God and of his will, which is nece&s;&s;ary unto &s;al|vation: Therefore it plea&s;ed the Lord at &s;undry times, and in diver&s;e manners to reveal him&s;elf, and to declare that his will unto his church; &amp; afterwards for the better pre&s;erving and propagating of the truth, and for the more &s;ure e&s;tabli&s;hment and comfort of the church again&s;t the corruption of the fle&s;h, and the malice of &s;atan and of the world, to commit the &s;ame wholly to writing: Which maketh the holy &s;cripture to be mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary; tho&s;e for|mer ways of God's revealing his will unto his people being now cea&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2">2. Under the name of holy &s;cripture, or the word of God written, are now contained all the the books of the old and new te&s;tament, which are the&s;e:</P>
<P>Of the Old Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>Gene&s;is, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Jo&s;hua, Judges, Ruth, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, E&s;ther, Job, P&s;alms, Proverbs, Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, The Song of Songs, I&s;aiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Ho&s;ea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah, Malachi.</P>

<P N="3">3. The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine in&s;piration, are no part of the canon of the &s;cripture; and therefore are of no authority in the church of God, nor to be any otherwi&s;e approved or made u&s;e of.</P>

<P N="5">5. We may be moved and induced by the te&s;timony of the church, to an high and reverened e&s;teem of the holy &s;cripture. And the heavenline&s;s of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the maje&s;ty of the &s;tyle, the con&s;ent of all the parts, the &s;cope of the whole (which is, to give all glory to God) the full di&s;covery it makes of the only way of mans &s;alvation, the many other incomparable excellen|cies, and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence it &s;elf to be the word of God; yet notwith&s;tanding, our full pre&s;wa&s;ion and a&s;|&s;urance of the infallible truth and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the holy &s;pirit, bearing witne&s;s by and with the word in our hearts.</P>
<P N="6">6. The whole coun&s;el of God concerning all things nece&s;&s;ary for his own glory, man's &s;alvation, faith and and life, is either &s;et down in &s;cripture, or by good and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence may be deduced from &s;cripture; unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men. Never|thele&s;s we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;aving under&s;tanding of &s;uch things as are revealed in the world: And that there are &s;ome circum&s;tances concerning the wor&s;hip of God and government of the church, common to human actions and &s;ocieties, which are to be ordered by the light of nature, and chri&s;tian prudence, according to the general rules of the word, which are always to be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="7">7. All things in &s;cripture are not alike plain in them|&s;elves, nor alike clear unto all: Yet tho&s;e things which are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be known, believed and ob&s;erved for &s;alvation, are &s;o clearly propounded and opened in &s;ome place of

&s;cripture or other, that not only the learned, but the un|learned, in a due u&s;e of the ordinary means, may attain unto a &s;ufficient under&s;tanding of them.</P>
<P N="8">8. The old te&s;tament in <HI>Hebrew,</HI> (which was the native language of the people of God of old) and the new te&s;tament in <HI>Greek,</HI> (which at the time of writing of it was mo&s;t generally known to the nations) being immediately in&s;pired by God, &amp; by his &s;ingular care &amp; providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical; &s;o as in all con|trover&s;ies of religion, the church is finally to appeal unto them. But becau&s;e the&s;e original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto and intere&s;t in the &s;criptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read and &s;earch them; therefore they are to be tran&s;la|ted into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come, that the word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may wor&s;hip him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the &s;criptures may have hope.</P>
<P N="9">9. The infallible rule of interpretation of &s;cripture, is the &s;cripture it &s;elf; and therefore when there is a que&s;|tion about the true and full &s;en&s;e of any &s;cripture (which is not manifold, but one) it mu&s;t be &s;earched and known by other places, that &s;peak more clearly.</P>
<P N="10">10. The &s;upream judge by which all controver&s;ies of re|ligion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men and private &s;pirits, are to be examined, and in who&s;e &s;entence we are to re&s;t, can be no other, but the holy &s;criptures delivered by the Spirit; into which &s;cripture &s;o delivered, our faith is finally re&s;olved.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of God's eternal Decree.</HEAD>
<P>GOD from all eternity did by the mo&s;t wi&s;e and holy coun&s;el of his own will, freely and unchangably or|dain what&s;oever comes to pa&s;s: Yet &s;o, as there|by neither is God the author of &s;in, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures, nor is the liberty or contin|gency of &s;econd cau&s;es taken away, but rather e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P N="2">2. Although God knows what&s;oever may or can come to pa&s;s upon all &s;uppo&s;ed conditions, yet hath he not de|creed

<P N="3">3. By the decree of God for the manife&s;tation of his glory, &s;ome men and angels are prede&s;tinated unto ever|la&s;ting life, and others fore-ordained to everla&s;ting death.</P>
<P N="4">4. The&s;e angels and men thus prede&s;tinated, and fore-ordained, are particularly and unchangeably de&s;igned, and their number is &s;o certain and definite, that it cannot be either increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P N="5">5. Tho&s;e of mankind that are prede&s;tinated unto life, God before the foundation of the world was laid, accord|ing to his eternal and immutable purpo&s;e, and the &s;ecret coun&s;el and good plea&s;ure of his will, hath cho&s;en in Chri&s;t unto everla&s;ting glory, out of his meer free grace and love, without any fore&s;ight of faith or good works, or per&s;eve|rence in either of them, or any other thing in the creature, as conditions or cau&s;es moving him thereunto, and all to the prai&s;e of his glorious grace.</P>
<P N="6">6. As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, &s;o hath he by the eternal and mo&s;t free purpo&s;e of his will fore-ordained all the means thereunto: Wherefore they who are elected, being fallen in <HI>Adam,</HI> are redeemed by Chri&s;t, are effectually called unto faith in Chri&s;t by his Spirit working in due &s;ea&s;on, are ju&s;tified, adopted, &s;anctified, and kept by his power, through faith, unto &s;alvation.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of Ju&s;tification.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE whom God effectually calleth, he al&s;o freely ju&s;tifieth, not by infu&s;ing righteou&s;ne&s;s into them, but by pardoning their &s;ins, and by accounting and accepting their per&s;ons as righteous, not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Chri&s;t's &s;ake alone; nor by imputing faith it&s;elf, the act of believing, or any other evangelical obedience to them, as their righteou&s;ne&s;s, but by imputing Chri&s;t's active obedience unto the whole law, and pa&s;&s;ive obedience in his &s;ufferings and death, for their whole and &s;ole righteou&s;ne&s;s, they re|ceiving and re&s;ting on him and his righteou&s;ne&s;s by faith; which faith they have not of them&s;elves, it is the gift of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. Faith thus receiving and re&s;ting on Chri&s;t and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, is the alone in&s;trument of ju&s;tification; yet it is not alone in the per&s;on ju&s;tified, but is ever accompa|nied with all other &s;aving graces, and is no dead faith, but worketh by love.</P>
<P N="3">3. Chri&s;t by his obedience and death did fully di&s;|charge the debt of all tho&s;e that are ju&s;tified, and did by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf, in the blood of his cro&s;s, undergo|ing in their &s;tead the penalty due unto them, make a pro|per, real and full &s;atisfaction to God's ju&s;tice in their be|half: Yet ina&s;much as he was given by the Father for them, and his obedience and &s;atisfaction accepted in their &s;tead, and both freely, not for any thing in them, their ju&s;tification is only of free grace, that both the exact ju&s;tice and rich grace of God might be glorified in the ju&s;tifica|tion of &s;inners.</P>
<P N="4">4. God did from all eternity decree to ju&s;tify all the elect, and Chri&s;t did in the fullne&s;s of time die for their &s;ins and ri&s;e again for their ju&s;tification: Neverthele&s;s, they are not ju&s;tified per&s;onally, until the holy Spirit doth in due time actually apply Chri&s;t unto them.</P>

<P N="2">2.

<P>SUCH of the elect as are converted at riper years, hav|ing &s;ometime lived in the &s;tate of nature, and there|in &s;erved divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures, God in their ef|fectual calling giveth them repentance unto life.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whereas there is none that doth good, and &s;inneth not, and the be&s;t of men may through the power and de|ceitfulne&s;s of their corruptions dwelling in them, with the prevalency of temptation, fall into great &s;ins and provoca|tions; God hath in the covenant of grace mercifully pro|vided that believers &s;o &s;inning and falling, be renewed through repentance unto &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="3">3. This &s;aving repentance is an evangelical grace, whereby a per&s;on being by the holy Gho&s;t made &s;en&s;ible of the manifold evils of his &s;in, doth by faith in Chri&s;t humble him&s;elf for it with godly &s;orrow, dete&s;tation of it, and &s;elf-abhorrency, praying for pardon and &s;trength of grace, with a purpo&s;e and endeavor by &s;upplies of the Spirit, to walk before God unto all well-plea&s;ing in all things.</P>
<P N="4">4. As repentance is to be continued through the whole cour&s;e of our lives, upon the account of the body of death, and the motions thereof; &s;o it is every man's duty to re|pent of his particular known &s;ins, particularly.</P>
<P N="5">5.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. Of good Works.</HEAD>
<P>GOOD works are only &s;uch as God hath command|ed in his holy word, and not &s;uch as without the warrant thereof are devi&s;ed by men out of blind zeal, or upon any pretence of good intentions.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="255" REF="012626_0252_0F8B935B4F87C4E0">2. The&s;e good works done in obedience to God's commandments, are the fruits and evidences of a true and living faith, and by them believers manife&s;t their thank|fulne&s;s, &s;trengthen their a&s;&s;urance, edify their brethren, a|dorn the profe&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel, &s;top the mouths of the adver&s;aries, and glorify God, who&s;e workman&s;hip they are, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us thereunto, that having their fruit unto holine&s;s, they may have the end eternal life.</P>
<P N="3">3. Their ability to do good works is not at all of them&s;elves, but wholly from the Spirit of Chri&s;t: And that they may be enabled thereunto, be&s;ides the graces they have already received, there is required an actual in|fluence of the &s;ame holy Spirit to work in them to will and to do, of his good plea&s;ure; yet are they not hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty, unle&s;s upon a &s;pecial motion of the Spirit, but they ought to be diligent in &s;tirring up the grace of God that is in them.</P>
<P N="4">4. They who in their obedience attain to the greate&s;t height which is po&s;&s;ible in this life, are &s;o far from being able to &s;upererogate, and to do more than God requires, as that they fall &s;hort of much, which in duty they are bound to do.</P>
<P N="5">5. We cannot by our be&s;t works merit pardon of &s;in, or eternal life at the hand of God, by rea&s;on of the great di&s;proportion that is between them, and the glory to come; and the infinite di&s;tance that is between us, and God, whom by them we can neither profit, nor &s;atisfy for the debt of our former &s;ins; but when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofitable &s;ervants: And becau&s;e as they are good, they proceed from his Spirit, and as they are wrought by us, they are defiled and mixed with &s;o much weakne&s;s and imperfecti|on, that they cannot endure the &s;everity of God's judge|ment.</P>
<P N="6">6. Yet notwith&s;tanding, the per&s;ons of believers being accepted through Chri&s;t, their good works al&s;o are accept|ed in him, not as though they were in this life wholly un|blameable and unreproveable in God's &s;ight, but that he looking upon them in his Son is plea&s;ed to accept and re|ward that which is &s;incere, although accompanied with many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tne&s;&s;es and imperfections.</P>

<P N="3">3. And though they may through the temptation of Satan, and of the world, the prevalency of corruption re|maining in them, and the neglect of the means of their pre&s;ervation, fall into grievous &s;ins, and for a time con|tinue therein, whereby they incur God's di&s;plea&s;ure, and grieve his holy Spirit, come to have their graces and com|forts impaired, have their hearts hardened, and their con|&s;ciences wounded, hurt and &s;candalize others, and bring temporal judgments upon them&s;elves; yet they are and &s;hall be kept by the power of God through faith unto &s;alvation.</P>

<P N="2">2.

<P>THE covenant of works being broken by &s;in, and made unprofitable unto life, God was plea&s;ed to give unto the elect the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t, the &s;eed of the woman, as the means of calling them, and begetting in them faith and repentance: In this promi&s;e, the go&s;pel, as to the &s;ub&s;tance of it, was revealed, and was therein effectual for the conver&s;ion and &s;alvation of &s;inners.</P>

The revelation of the go&s;pel unto &s;inners made in divers times, and by &s;undry parts, with the addition of promi&s;es and precepts for the obedience required therein, as to the nations and per&s;ons to whom it is granted, is meerly of the &s;overeign will and good plea&s;ure of God, not being annexed by virtue of any promi&s;e to the due im|provement of men's natural abilities, by virtue of com|mon light received without it, which none ever did make, or can &s;o do: And therefore in all ages the preaching of the go&s;pel hath been granted unto per&s;ons and nations, as to the extent or &s;traitning of it, in great variety, accord|ing to the coun&s;el of the will of God.</P>

<P N="3">3. Prayer with thank&s;giving, being one &s;pecial part of natural wor&s;hip, is by God required of all men; but that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the name of the Son, by the help of his Spirit, according to his will, with under&s;tanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, &amp; per&s;everence: And when with others in a known tongue.</P>

Who&s;oever taketh an oath warranted by the word of God, ought duly to con&s;ider the weightine&s;s of &s;o &s;olemn an act, and therein to avouch nothing but what he is fully per&s;waded is the truth: Neither may any man bind him|&s;elf by oath to any thing, but what is good &amp; ju&s;t, and what he believeth &s;o to be, and what he is able and re&s;olved to perform. Yet it is a &s;in to refu&s;e an oath touching any thing that is good and ju&s;t, being lawfully impo&s;ed by authority.</P>
<P N="4">4. An oath is to be taken in the plain and common &s;en&s;e of the words, without equivocation, or mental re&s;ervati|on: It cannot oblige to &s;in, but in any thing not &s;inful be|ing taken, it binds to performance, although to a mans own hurt; nor is it to be violated, although made to Hereticks or Infidels.</P>

<P>OUR Lord Je&s;us in the night wherein he was betray|ed, in&s;tituted the &s;acrament of his body and blood, called the Lord's &s;upper, to be ob&s;erved in his chur|ches to the end of the world, for the perpetual remem|brance, and &s;hewing forth of the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf in his death, the &s;ealing of all benefits thereof unto true be|lievers, their &s;piritual nouri&s;hment and growth in him, their further engagement in and to all duties which they owe unto him, and to be a bond and pledge of their com|munion with him, and with each other.</P>
<P N="2">2. In this &s;acrament Chri&s;t is not offered up to his Father, nor any real &s;acrifice made at all for remi&s;&s;ion of &s;in of the quick or dead, but only a memorial of that one offering up of him&s;elf upon the cro&s;s once for all, and a &s;piritual oblation of all po&s;&s;ible prai&s;e unto God for the &s;ame; &s;o that the popi&s;h &s;acrifice of the ma&s;s (as they call it) is mo&s;t abominable injurious to Chri&s;t's own only &s;acrifice, the alone propitiation for all the &s;ins of the elect.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Lord Je&s;us hath in this ordinance appointed his mini&s;ters to declare his word of in&s;titution to the peo|ple, to pray and ble&s;s the elements of bread and wine, and thereby to &s;et them apart from a common to an holy u&s;e, and to take and brake the bread, to take the cup, and (they communicating al&s;o them&s;elves) to give both to the communicants, but to none who are not then pre&s;ent in the congregation.</P>
<P N="4">4. Private ma&s;&s;es, or receiving the &s;acrament by a prie&s;t, or any other alone, as likewi&s;e the denial of the cup to the people, wor&s;hipping the elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about for adoration, and the re|&s;erving them for any pretended religious u&s;e, are all con|trary to the nature of this &s;acrament, and to the in&s;titution of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">5. The outward elements in this &s;acrament duly &s;et apart for the u&s;es ordained by Chri&s;t, have &s;uch relation to him crucified, as that truly, yet &s;acramentally only, they are &s;ometimes called by the name of the things they repre&s;ent, to wit, the body and blood of Chri&s;t; albeit in &s;ub&s;tance and nature they &s;till remain truly and only bread and wine as they were before.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="270" REF="012626_0267_0F8B936C6B4729A0">6. That doctrine which maintains a change of the &s;ub&s;tance of bread and wine, into the &s;ub&s;tance of Chri&s;t's body and blood (commonly called tran&s;ub&s;tantiation) by con&s;ecration of a prie&s;t, or any other way, is repugnant not to the &s;cripture alone, but even to common &s;en&s;e and rea|&s;on, overthroweth the nature of the &s;acrament, and hath been, and is the cau&s;e of manifold &s;uper&s;titions, yea, of gro&s;s idolatries.</P>
<P N="7">7. Worthy receivers outwardly partaking of the vi|&s;ible elements in this &s;acrament, do then al&s;o inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but &s;piritully, receive and feed upon Chri&s;t crucified, and all benefits of his death; the body &amp; blood of Chri&s;t being then not corporally or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nally in with, or under the bread and wine, yet as really, but &s;piritually pre&s;ent to the faith of believers in that ordinance, as the elements them&s;elves are to their outward &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P N="8">8. All ignorant and ungodly per&s;ons as they are un|fit to enjoy communion with Chri&s;t, &s;o are they unworthy of the Lord's table, and cannot without great &s;in again&s;t him, whil&s;t they remain &s;uch, partake of the&s;e holy my&s;|teries, or be admitted thereunto; yea, who&s;oever &s;hall receive unworthily, are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, eating and drinking judgment to them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP.XXXI. Of the State of Man after Death, and of the Re&s;urrection of the Dead.</HEAD>
<P>THE bodies of men after death return to du&s;t, and &s;ee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orruption, but their &s;ouls (which neither die nor &s;leep) having an immortal &s;ub&s;tance immediately return to God&punc; who gave them, the &s;ouls of the righteous being then made perfect in holine&s;s, are received into the highe&s;t heavens, where they behold the face of God in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies: And the &s;ouls of the wicked are ca&s;t into hell, where they remain in torment, and utter darkne&s;s, re&s;erved to the judgment of the great day: Be&s;ides the&s;e two places of &s;ouls &s;eparated from their bodies, the &s;cripture acknow|ledgeth none.</P>

<P N="3">3. The bodies of the unju&s;t &s;hall by the power of Chri&s;t be rai&s;ed to di&s;honour; the bodies of the ju&s;t by his Spirit unto honor, and be made conformable to his own glorious body.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII. Of the la&s;t Judgment.</HEAD>
<P>GOD hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s by JESUS CHRIST, to whom all power and judgment is given of the Father; in which day, not only the apo&s;tate angels &s;hall be judge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, but likewi&s;e all per&s;ons that have lived upon earth, &s;hall appear before the tribunal of Chri&s;t, to give an account of their thoughts, words and deeds, and to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.</P>
<P N="2">2. The end of God'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> appointing this day, is for the manife&s;tation of the glory of his mercy in the eternal &s;al|vation of the elect, and of his ju&s;tice in the damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked and di&s;obedient: For then &s;hall the righteous go into everla&s;ting life, and receive that fullne&s;s of joy and glory, with everla&s;ting reward in the pre&s;ence of the LORD, but the wicked who know not GOD, and obey not the go&s;pel of JESUS CHRIST, &s;hall be ca&s;t into eternal torments, and be puni&s;hed with everla&s;t|ing de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the LORD, and from the glory of his power.</P>
<P N="3">3. As Chir&s;t would have us to be certainly per&s;uaded that there &s;hall be a judgment, both to deter all men from&s;in, and for the greater con&s;olation of the godly in their adver&s;ity; &s;o will he have that day unknown to men, that they may &s;hake off all carnal &s;ecurity, and be always watchful, becau&s;e they know not at what hour the LORD will come, and may be ever prepared to &s;ay, <HI>Come Lord Je&s;us, come quickly.</HI> AMEN</P>
