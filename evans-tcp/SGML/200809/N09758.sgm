<HEAD>SECT. I. The State of the que&s;tion.</HEAD>
<P>_THEY who have been conver&s;ant with controver&s;ial writings need not be in|formed what vexatious wrangles are often carried on about the true &s;tate and meaning of the que&s;tion in di&s;|pute; each party confidently charg|ing the other with maintaining propo&s;itions which they utterly di&s;own. One great cau&s;e of which we have rea&s;on to think is becau&s;e men aim rather to di&s;play their own talent at rea&s;oning, than to in&s;truct tho&s;e in meekne&s;s who are in oppo&s;ition to them. They who have this in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iew, to run down and tri|umph over an antagoni&s;t at all events, if they find them&s;elves unable to confute what he has really a&s;&s;ert|ed, mu&s;t pretend that he ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds to &s;omething which they imagine them&s;elves able to confute. But though the due exerci&s;e of charity and a candid fair &s;pirit to|wards tho&s;e with whom they may have to do in a way of di&s;putation, would no doubt much &s;horten
<PB N="2" REF="012416_0006_0F8974DAF271CD98">
their work, and di&s;incumber their di&s;cour&s;es of abun|dance of vain jangling; yet &s;o imperfect are our conceptions, and &s;uch is the ambiguity of language, the be&s;t medium we have of communicating our ideas, that even intelligent per&s;ons, and tho&s;e mu|tually well affected, will many times &s;trangely mi&s;take the de&s;igned purport of each others expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Had it not been for our di&s;tant &s;ituation from each other, I would, before I entred the li&s;ts of public debate with the Rev. Mr. Hopkins, have tried whe|ther by private conference, or letters, the difference of opinion that appears to be between us might not have been &s;omewhat narrowed and reduced.&mdash;But at pre&s;ent I have no other way of entring into his views than by what he has publi&s;hed; which while I examine with freedom, I hope I &s;hall not tran&s;gre&s;s the law of charity towards a fellow labourer in the Go&s;pel, or the rules of mode&s;ty towards one, who, on other accounts be&s;ides &s;uperiority of age, is intitled to re&s;pectful treatment from the author of the en&s;u|ing e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject now to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed having never (that I know of) been controverted among profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians till very lately, it will be the more nece&s;&s;ary for us to take care that we conceive aright of the que&s;tion propo&s;ed to con&s;ideration&mdash;And that the &s;tate of the que&s;tion may be truly and plainly repre|&s;ented, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for us in the fir&s;t place to di&s;tingui&s;h it from &s;ome other que&s;tions with which it may inadvertently be confounded.&mdash;Let it then be carefully ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is not whether it be the duty of the unregenerate to obey all and each of the commands of God. The obligation of all mankind to obey the divine law, is on both &s;ides equally acknowledged.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="012416_0007_0F8974DBB27AAB20">Nor is it di&s;puted whether there be ordinarily a work of the holy Spirit upon the &s;oul preparatory to regeneration. This we both plead for.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o mutually allowed that this preparatory work is ordinarily carried on by means of the outward di&s;|pen&s;ation of the word, and other divine ordinances.</P>
<P>And that the <HI>Endeavours</HI> of the unregenerate in attending on God's word and ordinances are, by his appointment and ble&s;&s;ing, &s;ub&s;ervient to this prepa|ratory work.</P>
<P>And further, that God has &s;ome way given en|couragement to the endeavours of the unregenerate in a way of attendance on the means of grace.&mdash; This, though perhaps denied by &s;ome, with whom at pre&s;ent we concern not our&s;elves, is expre&s;ly grant|ed by Mr. H. I &s;hall now propo&s;e that &s;tate of the que&s;tion which Mr. H. has given in the &s;econd part of his reply to the Rev. Mr. Mills, p. 116.</P>
<P>'The que&s;tion' &s;ays he
<Q>is, whether there are any commands given to the unregenerate which <HI>do not</HI> require any thing holy, <HI>but only</HI> require &s;uch exer|ci&s;es and doings which they may and do comply with while they are perfect enemies to true holine&s;s?</Q></P>
<P>If Mr. H. had only maintained the negative of the que&s;tion as above propo&s;ed, the difference which &s;eems to be between him and tho&s;e who maintain that &s;omething is enjoined upon and required of &s;in|ners in a way of duty previous and preparatory to regeneration, might I conceive be accommodated without much trouble.&mdash;For we conceive that there is no incon&s;i&s;tency in &s;uppo&s;ing that a divine com|mand which requires holine&s;s, and nothing but what is &s;ome way included in holine&s;s, does yet require and oblige to the performance of &s;ome actions, which taken nakedly in them&s;elves, &s;eparate from &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, qualifications and adjuncts as ought to
<PB N="4" REF="012416_0008_0F8974DC72904278">
accompany them, have not the complete e&s;&s;ence of holine&s;s.&mdash;We conceive that the holine&s;s of an action con&s;i&s;ts in its entire conformity to the divine law, in it&s;elf, its principles, end a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d manner.&mdash;That the law which requires the whole of what is nece&s;&s;ary to con|&s;titute an action holy, does al&s;o require each of tho&s;e things in particular which are involved and conjoined in every act of holy obedience, although the com|plete e&s;&s;ence of holine&s;s is not found in any of tho&s;e particulars detached from the re&s;t. There is a great breadth in the divine law, to which every act of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ue holine&s;s mu&s;t be &s;ome way an&s;werable. Whatever particular is comprehended in the duty required by any divine precept, is therefore matter of duty becau&s;e contained in the command; and yet it will not fol|low, either that whatever is contained in the duty required has (taken by it&s;elf) the whole of what is e&s;&s;ential to true holine&s;s, or that there is any com|mand which <HI>does not</HI> require any thing holy, but <HI>only</HI> requires unholy acts. In a word, we conceive that it may very con&s;i&s;tently be maintained, that though no actions of the unregenerate are &s;o fully conformable to the divine command as that they can be denominated holy in the lea&s;t degree, being e&s;&s;en|tially defective in divers re&s;pects; yet &s;ome actions are conformable to the divine command in &s;ome re|&s;pects, and are therefore comprehended in the re|quirement of it.</P>
<P>Whether &s;uch conceptions of the commands of God and of the actions of the unregenerate are agre|able to &s;cripture and rea&s;on will afterwards be exa|mined. Our pre&s;ent de&s;ign is not to argue points, but to open the &s;ubject of the en&s;uing enquiry. But it is very manife&s;t that Mr. H&mdash;'s aim and de&s;ign is not &s;o much to prove that there is no command which requires <HI>only</HI> &s;uch actions as may be done in
<PB N="5" REF="012416_0009_0F8974DD30666950">
a &s;tate of unregeneracy, but that no actions of the unregenerate are required <HI>at all.</HI> If he would admit that they were required <HI>at all</HI> in any divine precept, and that con&s;equently we had any divine warrant to inculcate upon &s;inners an attendance on the means of grace, as preparatory to regeneration, I would ne|ver contend with him, though he &s;hould at the &s;ame time hold that this is not the whole duty contained in and injoined upon them by &s;uch precept. The que&s;tion then is not, as he has repre&s;ented,
<Q>whether there are any commands given to the unregenerate which <HI>do not require any thing truly holy, but only</HI> require &s;uch exerci&s;es as have not the nature of true holine&s;s.</Q>
But the que&s;tion is, <HI>whether any actions which men do or can perform while unregene|rate, are required of them in and by any divine com|mand?</HI> This we affirm and Mr. H. denies.</P>
<P>This appears from the whole drift of his rea&s;on|ing, which is to oppo&s;e and confute the notion of unregenerate duties as he calls them; that is, of du|ties required of men to be performed by them previ|ous to regeneration. And his expre&s;s words (p. 116.) put this matter out of doubt. For after &s;aving that his opponent has attempted to prove that God does require duties of the unregenerate which they are to do, and do and may perform while in an unregene|rate &s;tate, and al&s;o that he &s;u&s;pected and even con|cluded that he (Mr. H.) held to no &s;uch duties, he adds that <HI>he readily owns the charge</HI>; and proceeds accordingly to produce his arguments.</P>
<P>But to prepare the way for the clearer di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the important que&s;tion above &s;tated, there are &s;ome preliminary enquiries which I have propo&s;ed to con|&s;ider by them&s;elves, and which will furni&s;h matter abundantly &s;ufficient for the next Section.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. An enquiry into the character of the unre|generate, their powers and principles of action, with the nature and quality of tho&s;e exerci&s;es of which they are capable.</HEAD>
<P>THE points propo&s;ed to examination in this Section being important, and nearly connected with our main &s;ubject, and having been the &s;ubjects of great controver&s;ies, by means of which, as it often happens in the like ca&s;e, they have fallen into much confu&s;ion and intanglement through the &s;ubtilties of vain philo&s;ophy, there will be need of careful attention to give a clear and ju&s;t repre&s;enta|tion of truth, avoiding erroneous extremes on either hand. I will endeavour to be as plain as the nature of the &s;ubjects will allow; though I fear it will be &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to enter farther into &s;ome ab&s;tru&s;e metaphy&s;ical di&s;qu&s;itions than is de&s;irable in a theo|logical di&s;&s;ertation. If the reader has not a reli&s;h for &s;uch &s;peculations, he may relieve him&s;elf without much inconvenience by now and then pa&s;&s;ing over a paragraph or two which may appear dry and barren.</P>
<P>As we are to con&s;ider the character of the unrege|nerate, the fir&s;t enquiry is, who are intended by the unregenerate? To which the an&s;wer is obvious: all tho&s;e are intended who have never been the &s;ubjects of that important change termed by chri&s;tians, rege|neration or being born again: That change whereby men become true chri&s;tians or &s;aints, as the &s;criptural phra&s;e is. I &s;hall not here &s;tay to &s;hew the different &s;ignifications in which this word has been under&s;tood by divines. In Scripture it &s;ignifies the &s;ame as con|ver&s;ion, or a man's being turned, or turning from &s;in
<PB N="7" REF="012416_0011_0F8974DEB173F150">
to holine&s;s, as has been well proved by a learned writer of our own. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards on Original Sin, part 3. chap. 2.</NOTE> And if Chri&s;tian divines had kept to the &s;criptural &s;en&s;e of the word, without ei|ther enlarging or narrowing it, they would, I &s;up|po&s;e, have done as they ought to do. However, there is a more limited &s;en&s;e which has obtained with many. Regeneration in this &s;trict &s;en&s;e imports the immediate work of the holy Spirit, creating, infu&s;ing or communicating a principle of &s;piritual life, with a power for holy exerci&s;es and acts. It is commonly, if not univer&s;ally in this latter &s;en&s;e, that the word is to be under&s;tood when u&s;ed by Mr. H. If then the grace of regeneration imports a vital principle with a power for holy acts, then the defect or privation of this, in any man, is that in which the e&s;&s;ence of un|regeneracy con&s;i&s;ts. And every one who is a &s;ub|ject thereof is unregenerate.</P>
<P>Unregeneracy, I &s;ay, con&s;i&s;ts &s;trictly in a priva|tion, and not as &s;ome &s;eem to conceive) in principles or habits phy&s;ically and po&s;itively oppo&s;ite to good|ne&s;s. For fir&s;t, there are no po&s;itive principles of &s;in&s;olne&s;s in nature. If there were, they mu&s;t have a po&s;itive cau&s;e. They mu&s;t either be created in and with our nature by God, who mu&s;t therefore be the proper efficient cau&s;e of what is &s;imply and e&s;&s;entially evil, or el&s;e they mu&s;t be the production of &s;ome evil being, who is therefore in part the author of our na|ture; which is no other than the manichean Here&s;y. Secondly, though there be po&s;itive principles of &s;in|ful acts, yet unregeneracy does not con&s;i&s;t in them. If we take the word Sin in the concrete &s;en&s;e, then it is true there is &s;omething po&s;itive in the nature of it, which therefore mu&s;t flow from &s;ome po&s;itive cau&s;e and principle. But &s;infulne&s;s metaphy&s;ically and ab&s;tractly con&s;idered is only a defect, and flows only
<PB N="8" REF="012416_0012_0F8974E05268C8A8">
from a defect in the cau&s;es or principles of that act which is &s;inful. There are not in the nature of man po&s;itive principles of fooli&s;hne&s;s, though there are po&s;itive principles of action, which operating without the direction and government of wi&s;dom, are the &s;ource of fooli&s;h action, or folly in the concrete &s;en&s;e. And the &s;ame po&s;itive principles of action operating without the influence and government of holy di&s;po|&s;itions in creatures &s;ubject to the divine law, are the po&s;itive cau&s;es of &s;inful actions, which in the concrete &s;en&s;e are &s;in. It might ea&s;ily be &s;hewn that &s;in con|&s;i&s;ts formally and e&s;&s;entially in defect or privation contrary to the divine law: that it flows from pri|vative and deficient and not from po&s;itive and effici|ent cau&s;es: And that this is agreable to the judg|ment of the mo&s;t learned divines, who have mo&s;t zealou&s;ly maintained the doctrine of man's natural depravity in con&s;equence of the original lap&s;e. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P><PB N="9" REF="012416_0013_0F8974E14F0AF3C0">But it is nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved, that &s;ince unre|generacy con&s;i&s;ts in the privation of that rectitude and moral perfection of nature in which man was at fir&s;t created, and which by the divine law he was bound to maintain, it is therefore to be accounted not merely an unhappy but a faulty defect, which does not excu&s;e a &s;inner from guilt in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the laws of God, notwith&s;tanding his impotency and in|di&s;po&s;ition to exerci&s;es and acts of true holine&s;s.&mdash; Which ob&s;ervation is of importance to be remembred, that &s;inners may not exculpate them&s;elves while living in di&s;obedience to God, by perverting the doctrine of man's natural inability with re&s;pect to acts of holy obedience, and that the calumny which &s;ome have had the forehead to ca&s;t upon all who dare call in que&s;tion their novel opinions concerning the powers and actions of the unregenerate, who have without any ju&s;t foundation been charged with ju&s;tifying &s;in|ners in their impenitency and di&s;obedience to God, may be obviated.</P>
<P>But in order to our having right apprehen&s;ions of the &s;tate of the unregenerate, with the nature and quality of their actions, we mu&s;t enquire more di&s;tinct|ly into the&s;e things: Which is the more nece&s;&s;ary to be done, becau&s;e Mr. H. in his &s;ection on the cha|racter of the unregenerate, has di&s;cour&s;ed in too loo&s;e and declamatory a manner, and not with di&s;tinctne&s;s of method, preci&s;ion of expre&s;&s;ion, and clearne&s;s of evidence, which are nece&s;&s;ary to give a proper view of the &s;ubject.

Things which ought to be carefully and clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed, are often &s;o confounded and lumped together, as tends

exceedingly to darken and perplex the &s;ubject, in&s;tead of opening and illu&s;trating it. Yea &s;everal propo&s;i|tions are advanced, incon&s;i&s;tent with truth and &s;ound doctrine; which &s;o far as they fall in our way, and tend to ob&s;truct our progre&s;s, will in the proper place be animadverted upon.</P>
<P>The principal point here to be enquired into, is that impotency to the performance of duty which is implied in unregeneracy. For the opening of which, three things will be di&s;tinctly con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">I. The nature and degree of this impotency.</P>
<P N="2">II. The powers and a&s;&s;i&s;tances for action, which the unregenerate may be the &s;ubjects of.</P>
<P N="3">III. The nature and quality of tho&s;e actions which with the&s;e powers and a&s;&s;i&s;tances they may perform.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t enquiry we will divide into three branches, viz. What kind of impotency is that which is implied in unregeneracy.&mdash;And as impotency or power im|plies a relation to acts, we will declare what kind of acts they are, for which the unregenerate want pow|er &mdash;Then the degree of this impotency will be con|&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1. Concerning that kind of impotency the unre|generate are &s;uppo&s;ed to be under, there has been much enquiry. Many who have had occa&s;ion to make frequent mention of it &s;eem to have been much at a lo&s;s how to &s;tate the matter clearly, or how to conceive of it. This difficulty has been greatly in|crea&s;ed by means of the remarkable ambiguity at|tending almo&s;t every notable word and phra&s;e, com|monly occurring in di&s;cour&s;es on this &s;ubject; which ambiguity often lies &s;o deep as not to be readily ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>To remedy this inconvenience, the di&s;tinction of natural and moral impotency has been introduced, and is at this day much in vogue with many among
<PB N="11" REF="012416_0015_0F8974E271752200">
us, ever &s;ince an eminent writer of our own, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. Mr. Jonathan Edwards, late Pre&s;ident of New Jer&s;ey College.</NOTE> in his elaborate treati&s;e on the human will, &s;ome few years ago publi&s;hed, has made great u&s;e of this di&s;tinction. As it may &s;erve to throw &s;ome light upon the &s;ub|ject of our pre&s;ent enquiry, I will endeavour to &s;tate this famous di&s;tinction, as I find it laid down by tho&s;e who have made u&s;e of it, and then make &s;ome ob|&s;ervations upon it.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be a plain dictate of common &s;en&s;e, as well as of divine revelation, that there is &s;ome kind of inability with re&s;pect to certain actions, which is a good excu&s;e for not doing them. And on the o|ther hand it is evident from &s;cripture, and &s;eems to be a point generally acknowledged among Chri&s;tians, that men may be in &s;ome &s;en&s;e unable to do certain actions, which notwith&s;tanding they are bound in duty to do, and are inexcu&s;able for not doing. Here are we &s;ee two kinds of inability, the di&s;tinction be|tween which ought to be marked as &s;trongly and plainly as po&s;&s;ible. The former kind is meant by <HI>natural,</HI> the latter by <HI>moral inability.</HI></P>
<P>But unle&s;s we under&s;tand the real difference be|tween tho&s;e things which are di&s;tingui&s;hed by diffe|rent names, our knowing that one is called by this name, and the other by that, &s;hews us only their nominal difference. Our conceptions of things are not at all enlarged and improved, any more than by our knowing the latin or greek names of them. We mu&s;t then con&s;ider what is the real difference between the ideas, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the terms natural and moral inability. If this difference is clearly opened, and expre&s;&s;ed in words of plain and determinate &s;ig|nification, we have then what we wanted; but if the explication is given in terms as unfixed in their
<PB N="12" REF="012416_0016_0F8974E332756F48">
meaning, or as hard to be under&s;tood as what was to be explained is in it&s;elf, we are then as far from under&s;tanding the matter as before.</P>
<P>Let us then attend to the definition of natural and moral impotency. The fir&s;t is defined to be
<Q>an inability to do a thing, becau&s;e what is mo&s;t com|monly called nature does not allow of it, or becau&s;e of &s;ome impeding defect or ob&s;tacle that is extrin&s;ic to the will, either in the faculty of under&s;tanding, con&s;titution of body, or external objects.</Q></P>
<P>"Moral inability" we are told
<Q>con&s;i&s;ts not in any of the&s;e things, but in the oppo&s;ition or want of inclination.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards on the Will, p. 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>If this were a clear and exact repre&s;entation of the difference between that kind of impotency which is an excu&s;e for not doing an action, and that kind which is no excu&s;e, our pre&s;ent enquiry might ea&s;ily be an&s;wered. For we allow that the unregenerate are not held excu&s;able in their di&s;obedience to the divine law, though unable in &s;ome &s;en&s;e to yield that obedience which is required of them. But if I may (premi&s;ing due re&s;pect to the &s;uperior character of the author above mentioned) declare my mind freely, I mu&s;t &s;ay that this repre&s;entation of the matter is to me neither plain nor &s;ufficient, and introduces a lan|guage and manner of &s;peaking &s;o di&s;&s;onant from, and contradictory to the language of the &s;acred &s;criptures, and the almo&s;t univer&s;al &s;tile of &s;ound divines, that I cannot be plea&s;ed with it.</P>
<P>The real difference between that inability which ex|cu&s;es from acting, and that which does not, is not clearly expre&s;&s;ed, either by the terms natural and moral, which are as vague in their &s;ignification as al|mo&s;t any words in language, or by the definitions which are given of natural and moral inability. It
<PB N="13" REF="012416_0017_0F8974E3F0E44BE0">
will not be ea&s;y to find two &s;entences of equal length, containing more dark and ambiguous terms than the above definitions. When we are told that
<Q>natural impotency is an inability to do a thing, becau&s;e what is mo&s;t commonly called nature, does not allow it;</Q>
this &s;urely does not make the matter a jot the plainer. I am utterly at a lo&s;s what is commonly called na|ture; a word which is ob&s;erved to bear about a dozen different &s;ignifications. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Boyle's Enquiry into the Notion of Nature, p. 27, &amp;c.</NOTE> It is added,
<Q>or becau&s;e of &s;ome impeding defect or ob&s;tacle that is extrin&s;ic to the will.</Q>
Before we can under&s;tand what is here intended, there are two doubts of no &s;mall difficulty to be re&s;olved. Fir&s;t, what is meant by the will? Sometimes it means <HI>the power of willing,</HI> &s;ometimes the <HI>act of willingne&s;s,</HI> &s;ometimes the object or thing willed. Now which of the two former &s;en&s;es of the word is here meant, or whether both, is not I confe&s;s clear to me.&mdash;If by the will, is here meant <HI>actual willingne&s;s,</HI> then the impotency of the unre|generate, with re&s;pect to holy acts, mu&s;t be concluded to be <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>excu&s;able</HI> according to this de|finition, for it is certain that it is extrin&s;ic and ante|cedent to all <HI>exerci&s;es and acts</HI> of the will; which conclu&s;ion is doubtle&s;s very un&s;ound. If by the will is here meant the <HI>power of willing,</HI> then in ca&s;e a man intoxicates him&s;elf with &s;trong drink, to that degree as to di&s;order his under&s;tanding, and intro|duce an impeding defect or ob&s;tacle to the regular exerci&s;e of that faculty, his impotency to &s;ober and rational acts, is according to this definition natural and excu&s;able, &s;ince his incapacity is becau&s;e of a defect or di&s;order he has brought upon his under&s;tanding. But this &s;urely is not &s;o evidently true. And fur|ther, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that the defects or ob&s;tacles to action &s;hould be extrin&s;ic to the <HI>power of willing,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="012416_0018_0F8974E4B317A6A0">
in order to a creature's being excu&s;able for not act|ing. There is a <HI>defect of power to will an action,</HI> which is a good rea&s;on for not doing it. And there is al&s;o <HI>a defect of power to will,</HI> which is no good excu&s;e. But &s;econdly, We can never under&s;tand by this definition wherein con&s;i&s;ts natural inability, or whether tho&s;e impeding defects or ob&s;tacles which render an action impo&s;&s;ible be a good excu&s;e for not doing it, unle&s;s we are able to determine whether the&s;e ob&s;tacles or defects belong to the under&s;tanding or will or bodily con&s;titution. And I gue&s;s the&s;e are not &s;uch ea&s;y and plain points, that it is fit peo|ple &s;hould wait till they are clearly determined by the philo&s;ophers, before they &s;hould be able to determine whether their impotency excu&s;es them or not. Some who have been no mean philo&s;ophers, have thought that no real and natural di&s;tinction could be made between the faculties, habits, acts and objects of the under&s;tanding and will; which though it may be thought a wild notion by tho&s;e who have always been u&s;ed to think in a different track, yet for my own part I am &s;carce able to &s;hew that it is any ways ab&s;urd, or unphilo&s;ophical. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The faculties of the mind have been commonly di&s;tingui&s;hed by modern divines and philo&s;ophers into the under&s;tanding, the will, and the affections. Others comprehend the affecti|ons in the will; among whom is the Rev. Author above mentioned.&mdash;The object of the under&s;tanding is truth, the object of the will and affections is good. The mind by the under&s;tanding perceives, judges, rea&s;ons, knows, a&s;&s;ents; by the affections loves, rejoices, hates, grieves, &amp;c.&mdash;by the will chu&s;es, refu&s;es, exerts, forbears, and the like. The&s;e objects and acts of the mind at fir&s;t may &s;eem to be of a different nature; but this may perhaps be owing to our viewing the &s;ame object, as it were in a different attitude and light.&mdash;Thus Good, which is the object of the affecti|ons, is knowable, &s;o is an object of the under&s;tanding. It may be both known and loved. Yea to know and to love good, &s;eems to be the &s;ame thing. What is love, but the perception of goodne&s;s, or loveline&s;s? Perception is referred to the under&s;tanding, and affection to the will. But is there any more real difference between perceiving beauty and loving it, than there is between attraction and gravitation? It will be &s;aid, there is a twofold perception of objects, viz. <HI>Sub ratione ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &amp; &s;ub ratione boni</HI>: The former is referred to the intellect, the latter to the heart or will. But it may well be enquired, whether there be any object of perception in nature, or any perception or idea in the mind, which does not involve both tho&s;e re&s;pects? And whether perception, and ta&s;te, do not univer&s;ally, e&s;&s;entially and nece&s;&s;arily im|ply each other, their difference being rather nominal than real? Whether there be any ta&s;te without perception, or any perception without ta&s;te? And con&s;equently, whether the under&s;tanding and heart, do not really contain each other, and their acts coincide? I have &s;ometimes thought that the promi&s;cuous u&s;e of the words, mind, under&s;tanding, heart, knowledge, love, ob&s;ervable in the in&s;pired books, was very agreable to this &s;uppo&s;ition, and gave &s;ome countenance to it. And yet the common di&s;tinction of the faculties of the mind may conveniently enough be retained, for method's &s;ake, provided we take care not to be led into mi&s;take by it. If what has been above &s;ugge&s;ted &s;hould be found agre|able to truth, will not &s;uch curious que&s;tions about which &s;ome have made &s;o much ado, viz. Whether the heart be renewed by the illumination of the under&s;tanding, or the under&s;tanding enlightned by the renovation of the heart, and the like, di&s;&s;olve into &s;moke and vanity, and all di&s;putes a|bout the priority and cau&s;ality of the one to the other may perhaps be found to proceed on a mi&s;taken hypothe&s;is.&mdash; However this may be, it &s;eems &s;carce worth while for Chri|&s;tians to &s;pend their time, and much le&s;s fall into uncharita|ble contentions, in weaving, and in &s;weeping away the fine &s;pun cobwebs of each other. Surely the fates of Greece de|pend not upon the&s;e things.</NOTE> And however this may
<PB N="15" REF="012416_0019_0F8974E572D93258">
be, it is not &s;urely fit that a di&s;tinction of &s;o much importance as this, between that inability which ex|cu&s;es and that which does not, &s;hould turn upon &s;o nice and ab&s;tru&s;e a point, as whether the defect or ob&s;tacle lies in the under&s;tanding or the will.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="012416_0020_0F8974E7329372E0">The definition of moral inability is equally dark and indeterminate. "Moral inability" we are told,
<Q>con&s;i&s;ts not in any of tho&s;e things before mention|ed, but either in the want of inclination, or the &s;trength of a contrary inclination; or the want of &s;ufficient motives in view to induce and excite the act of the will, or the &s;trength of apparent motives to the contrary; or both the&s;e may be re&s;olved into one, and it may be &s;aid in one word, that moral inability con&s;i&s;ts in the oppo&s;ition or want of inclination.</Q>
Here we may ob&s;erve that the word <HI>inclination</HI> may either &s;ignify an <HI>act of the &s;oul,</HI> or it may &s;ignify <HI>a power promptitude and habitual fitne&s;s of the &s;oul to incline,</HI> upon the propo&s;al of proper objects, motives and per&s;ua&s;ives. The words in which this definition is expre&s;&s;ed, as well as tho&s;e which immediately follow, would per&s;uade one to think that by inclination is here meant <HI>the act of in|clining, or preferring.</HI> For this is &s;poken of as &s;up|po&s;ing and depending upon motives in the view of the mind. For it is &s;aid,
<Q>When a per&s;on is unable to will or chu&s;e &s;uch a thing through a defect of motives, or prevalence of contrary motives, <HI>it is the &s;ame thing as his being unable through the want of an inclination, or the prevalence of a contrary inclination, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, and under &s;uch views.</HI></Q>
And yet I can hardly think that the want of <HI>actual inclination,</HI> or <HI>the want of motives in the view of the mind,</HI> is all that this learned author intends by moral inability. For then we mu&s;t con|clude that the inability of the unregenerate, with re|&s;pect to exerci&s;es of holy obedience, con&s;i&s;ts merely <HI>in the want of acts, or in contrary actings,</HI> (for this is allowed to be merely a moral inability by this au|thor) and con&s;equently the removal of this inability, which is effected in regeneration, is nothing el&s;e but
<PB N="17" REF="012416_0021_0F8974E7B12CA368">
producing an <HI>actual inclination</HI> to holine&s;s, by means of motives brought to the view of the mind, and not it creating or infu&s;ing any new habit, power, or principle in the mind and heart, and thereby giving an immediate &s;ubjective capacity of being &s;o influ|enced and wrought upon by motives, as to take a new actual inclination. But this is a conclu&s;ion which I cannot think this author would admit. Be&s;ides the words power and inability, have relation to acts. And in order of nature, power is nece&s;&s;arily prior to all acts flowing from it; even as the cau&s;e is nece&s;&s;arily prior to the effect. To talk of power or inability, whether natural or moral, in any other &s;en&s;e, is unintelligible jargon. Now this author often &s;peaks of a moral ina|bility to love God and holine&s;s, which he endeavours to prove is no excu&s;e. If then moral inability con&s;i&s;ts, as we are here told in the <HI>want of an inclination,</HI> then we mu&s;t conclude that there is an inclination prior to the love of God and holine&s;s, and which bears the rela|tion to it of a power to its act. The want of this incli|nation is the want of this power. The que&s;tion is, what is this inclination wherein con&s;i&s;ts our moral power to love God and holine&s;s, and the want of which is moral inability. Is it an inclination to God and holine&s;s? No certainly. For this is the very act it&s;elf of love. And it is as evidently ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e an act educed from it&s;elf as its power, of the want of power to con&s;i&s;t in the want of the act, as it would be to &s;uppo&s;e an effect to be its own cau&s;e. And to &s;ay that moral inability is no excu&s;e for not loving God is only &s;aying that a man's not loving God is no excu&s;e for not loving him. Which is too ridiculou&s;ly trifling to de&s;erve to be &s;olemnly debated or even &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted. Is this inclination, the want of which is moral inability, to love God, an in|clination (not to God and holine&s;s but) to the love of
<PB N="18" REF="012416_0022_0F8974E8710F0560">
God and holine&s;s? No. For then it will unavoid|ably follow that we mu&s;t fir&s;t have an inclination (that is a love) to the love of holine&s;s, and from thence as from its cau&s;e or power the act of love to holine&s;s mu&s;t flow, which is ab&s;urd, and prepo&s;ter|ous: Since it is manife&s;t that our loving God, is in order of nature, prior to our inclining to or loving the love of God; and con&s;equently the latter can|not be con&s;idered as a power, or the want of it as an inability of any kind whether natural or moral with relation to the former.</P>
<P>If by <HI>inclination</HI> we under&s;tand an habitual radi|cal principle or next power and promptitude in the &s;oul, to incline and yield to the influence of motives and moral per&s;ua&s;ives whereby a compliance with du|ty may be inculcated; then I grant that the want of this is that in which I do &s;uppo&s;e the inability of the unregenerate, with re&s;pect to acts of true holine&s;s, really to con&s;i&s;t. But then I ob&s;erve, fir&s;t, that I do not find that this is ever called mere moral impotency by any divine or philo&s;opher, before this author.&mdash; Secondly, his de&s;cription of moral inability as con|&s;i&s;ting in the want of motives, or in contrary motives, is not con&s;i&s;tent with the notion of inability here giv|en. For that power which is here &s;uppo&s;ed to be wanting does not con&s;i&s;t in, or depend upon any acts, affections, views, or motives in the mind what|&s;oever; but is a prior &s;ubjective ground of all holy exerci&s;es, and of the prevalence and efficacy of mo|tives thereunto. Indeed I am apt to think that the author above mentioned did mean to include this im|potency here de&s;cribed, in what he calls moral inabi|lity; but to &s;ay the truth, he often rea&s;ons about moral impotency in &s;o dark (not to &s;ay loo&s;e) a man|ner, that one is at a lo&s;s to know whether he means by it the want of a <HI>power to will,</HI> or the want of
<PB N="19" REF="012416_0023_0F8974E930BC70C0">
<HI>actual willingne&s;s.</HI> And he often appears to argue as if there were evidently no difference between that inability to duty which con&s;i&s;ts in the want of actual willingne&s;s, and that which con&s;i&s;ts in the want of a power to will; and concludes that it mu&s;t clearly follow, that becau&s;e unwillingne&s;s is no excu&s;e for not doing our duty, therefore the want of a principle or next power to be willing, is no excu&s;e: which con|clu&s;ion, though it be true in the ca&s;e of the unrege|nerate, yet will &s;carce follow from the&s;e premi&s;es; &s;ince in the judgment of common &s;en&s;e the ca&s;es are not parallel. Nor is the difference in the nature of things taken away or le&s;&s;ened at all, becau&s;e both may be comprehended under the common equivocal name of moral inability.</P>
<P>And therefore I add in the &s;econd place, that as this di&s;tinction of natural and moral inability is not plain and intelligible enough, &s;o it is lame and in&s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e of giving one a di&s;tinct and exact view of the &s;ubject to which it is applied. For under the common name of moral inability are &s;ignified &s;uch different &s;tates, as according to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind ought to be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed. For in&s;tance, who does not &s;ee that one who is under the dominion of &s;in, de&s;titute of any principle of virtue, given up of God to vile affections and hardne&s;s of heart, is under a far other kind of impotency to turn from the love and practice of &s;in to holine&s;s, than a man is &s;aid to be under to do any ordinary action of life while he is only unre&s;olved to do it, but at the &s;ame time has it in the power of his will to re&s;olve upon and do it, upon the propo&s;al of a good rea&s;on or motive, without having any new principles or ha|bits infu&s;ed to enable him unto it. The difference is great and &s;triking. The inability in the latter ca&s;e is what is (I think) frequently called moral impotency
<PB N="20" REF="012416_0024_0F8974E9F7184750">
by divines and philo&s;ophers; and needs nothing to remove it but what is called moral &s;ua&s;ion. But in order to remove the impotency in the former ca&s;e to actions &s;piritually good, the &s;inner mu&s;t have a new heart created, a new principle or ta&s;te communicated to him. And therefore this is much more commonly and properly called a natural impotency, though in a &s;omewhat qualified &s;en&s;e. The confounding the&s;e things together has been the occa&s;ion of &s;ome gro&s;s mi&s;takes, as before we have done we &s;hall have occa|&s;ion to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>I add thirdly, that the di&s;tinction of natural and moral inability, as under&s;tood and improved, of late, introduces a new &s;tile and language into religious di&s;|cour&s;es, &s;o di&s;&s;onant and contradictory to the lan|guage of &s;cripture, and that which has hitherto been received and u&s;ed in the church, that I think it ought not to be commended or imitated. The in&s;pired writers a&s;&s;ert not only a want of will, but of power to do that which is holy and acceptable to God, in &s;uch as are in a &s;tate, and under the dominion of &s;in: that the carnal mind <HI>is not</HI> and <HI>cannot</HI> be &s;ubject to the law of God: that the natural man <HI>cannot</HI> re|ceive and know the things of the Spirit of God: that an evil tree <HI>cannot</HI> bring forth good fruit: that no man <HI>can come</HI> to the Son except the Father draw him; that &s;eparate from Chri&s;t, <HI>we can do nothing,</HI> &s;piritually good, &amp;c. The&s;e phra&s;es, ac|cording to their proper &s;ignification, expre&s;s a real inability or want of power, and not merely a want of will. Nor do I remember that the inability of man as in a &s;tate of &s;in to comply with his duty in a holy manner, is ever in &s;cripture expre&s;&s;ed or &s;ig|nified by a word importing merely a want of will: or on the contrary, that a mere want of willingne&s;s is ever &s;ignified by the words and phra&s;es above quoted,

or any others of the &s;ame force. When our Savior tells the Jews, ye will not come to me that ye might have life, his de&s;ign herein was not to expre&s;s their inability in any &s;en&s;e to come to him, but their wilful refu&s;al, and actual rejection of him. In &s;cripture language, <HI>cannot</HI> and <HI>will not,</HI> &s;ignify different things; the former a want of power, the latter a want of acts. And they who confound the&s;e things together in their di&s;cour&s;es, depart at lea&s;t from the &s;tile of the &s;acred writings. I readily allow that the inability of the unregenerate is e&s;&s;entially different from that of mere animals with re&s;pect to moral actions: yet if we follow the &s;criptures, or general &s;tile of chri&s;tian writers, it is more proper to call it a <HI>natural impo|tency,</HI> than <HI>a moral impotency con&s;i&s;ting in a want of will.</HI> Such a departure from the language of the church is inconvenient, and ought not for light rea|&s;ons to be attempted. It is well known that chri&s;tian writers, e&s;pecially &s;ince the Pelagian controver&s;y, have con&s;tantly a&s;&s;erted that man in a &s;tate of &s;in is un|able, as well as unwilling to perform acts of holy o|bedience; and that it is nece&s;&s;ary they be furni&s;hed with a power herefor by the grace of God. And how univer&s;ally the Calvinian divines in particular, (for whom tho&s;e who hold this modern di&s;tinction &s;o &s;acred would be thought to have &s;ome regard) have maintained a <HI>natural</HI> as well as <HI>moral impotency</HI> in fallen man, with re&s;pect to the performance of &s;pi|ritual duties, is well known by tho&s;e who have been conver&s;ant with their writings.</P>
<P>I mean not to make difficulty about words and phra&s;es, provided the things &s;ignified by them are clearly and di&s;tinctly repre&s;ented: and I will allow that the impotency here intended may properly be called moral in &s;everal re&s;pects&mdash;as it relates to acts of a moral nature&mdash;as it is a moral, or culpable de|fect

&mdash;and as human nature was not originally &s;ubject to it, but it was contracted by &s;in.

<P>I &s;hall therefore endeavour to repre&s;ent in a &s;ome|what different manner, the nature of that inability here propo&s;ed to examination.

<P>The human &s;oul though immaterial and uncom|pounded in its &s;ub&s;tance, is the &s;ubject of various <HI>powers.</HI> By powers is meant both an ability to act, and a capacity of being acted upon. Of the&s;e pow|ers &s;ome are nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute man a proper &s;ubject of moral government. The&s;e are ordinarily di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Faculties.</HI> There are other powers which though not e&s;&s;ential to the being of a moral agent, are yet nece&s;&s;ary to his well-being, and to the right exerci&s;e of his faculties, in obeying the law of his creation. The&s;e are commonly called principles, habits, di&s;po&s;itions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect of its faculties the &s;oul <HI>is indifferently capable</HI> of &s;in or holine&s;s, of right or wrong action.

<P><PB N="23" REF="012416_0027_0F8974EC33710D58">The faculties of the &s;oul are &s;ometimes called <HI>the primary powers of moral action,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By moral actions I mean &s;uch as are commanded or forbid|den by the divine law.</NOTE> every action as &s;uch flows from the faculty as its proper phy&s;ical cau&s;e. And as what is called the matter or &s;ub&s;tance of acti|ons receives its being or is produced by the faculties, they are therefore called the <HI>material principles</HI> of action.</P>
<P>The moral habit or principle is for di&s;tinction &s;ome|times called <HI>the &s;econdary power of moral action</HI>;&mdash; whereby the &s;oul is capacitated, qualified, and (as it were) bia&s;&s;ed not only to act, but al&s;o to act in <HI>&s;uch a manner</HI>; that is, wi&s;ely and virtuou&s;ly.

Nor is this to be a&s;cribed merely to the ob|jective propo&s;al of opportunities and motives, but to the &s;ubjective meetne&s;s and di&s;po&s;ition of the agent to be wrought upon and influenced by them. Which di&s;po&s;ition or meetne&s;s does not lie in the natural fa|culties in them&s;elves con&s;idered, &s;ince it may be in|crea&s;ed, dimini&s;hed, and even totally lo&s;t, while the natural faculties remain the &s;ame; but is a perfection &s;uperadded to and as it were inve&s;ting them, and co|operating in all their exerci&s;es and operations.</P>
<P>To make this matter, if I can, a little plainer, I will here endeavour to explain more particularly what I mean by habits, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the faculties.</P>
<P>The word habit is &s;ometimes u&s;ed in a narrow &s;en&s;e for a di&s;po&s;ition or promptitude to any particular man|ner of action, which <HI>is acquired by a &s;eries of actions.</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="012416_0028_0F8974ECF0AC6360">
This is &s;ometimes called cu&s;tom, which &s;ometimes hangs &s;o heavy a bias upon the mind in its operations, as to induce what is called a <HI>moral nece&s;&s;ity or inabi|lity</HI> to certain actions. By which is not commonly meant any inclinations which a man has no power to re&s;i&s;t or controul, but &s;uch as cannot without great difficulty be overcome. The&s;e contracted habits much re&s;emble natural propen&s;ities in their influence and ef|fects. Hence cu&s;tom is called a <HI>&s;econdary nature.</HI> It not only &s;trengthens the natural appetites, but will really create new ones which nature never gave us; as appears in a multitude of obvious in&s;tances.</P>
<P>But the word habit has obtained a more general and exten&s;ive &s;ignification among divines. It is u&s;ed to expre&s;s any principle, di&s;po&s;ition, or propen&s;ity, which is a foundation of mens loving or hating particular ob|jects, or acting in a particular manner. They are ac|cordingly reduced to three cla&s;&s;es: natural, called in|&s;tincts &mdash;&s;upernatural or infu&s;ed, called graces,&mdash;and acquired, which have been above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>It may further be ob&s;erved, that as there are <HI>pro|pen&s;ities and powers</HI> in the mind, <HI>previous to and in|dependent upon all its views and exerci&s;es,</HI> which are internal and habitual principles of operation; &s;o there are other powers, which flow as acts from &s;ome prior principle or habit in the mind: which may there|fore at the &s;ame time be con&s;idered as both habits and acts, though in different re&s;pects; even as the &s;ame thing, con&s;idered in different relations, may be both a cau&s;e and an effect; which is the ca&s;e of all cau&s;es except the fir&s;t. Thus love is an <HI>act</HI> flowing from habit in the &s;oul; and at the &s;ame time is it&s;elf <HI>a habit or principle</HI> of beneficent action.</P>
<P>The difference between the primary and &s;econdary power of action, or between the faculties and habits of the mind, may be yet better conceived of when illu&s;trated by a familiar in&s;tance and example.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="012416_0029_0F8974EDB286EFC0">As man has a power of uttering articulate &s;ounds to &s;ignify his ideas, he may be &s;aid to have the faculty or fir&s;t power of &s;peaking any particular language.

And words con|&s;idered &s;imply as articulate &s;ounds &s;tanding for ideas, are produced by the faculty of &s;peech as their proper phy&s;ical cau&s;e.

<P>The faculties are e&s;&s;ential and in&s;eperable powers of the human &s;oul: particular habits are not e&s;&s;ential and in&s;eperable powers.

he is qualified and di&s;po&s;ed to exerci&s;e them in a holy manner, may be &s;aid to have a remote power for holy action; but when he is furni&s;hed and qua|lified with the&s;e principles, he has an immediate or next power, and is capable of being excited thereto by the propo&s;al of occa&s;ions, and motives &s;uited to touch the&s;e &s;prings of action, and educe from them &s;uch exerci&s;es and operations.</P>
<P>This may &s;uffice to &s;hew what is intended by the primary and &s;econdary power of moral action.</P>
<P>To apply this to the point in hand, let it be ob|&s;erved, that the inability of the unregenerate with re|&s;pect to acts of holy obedience, does not con&s;i&s;t in the want of any natural faculty nece&s;&s;ary for the per|formance of it, as is on all hands acknowledged. Re|generation, which removes this inability, is not a cre|ation of new natural faculties. How they are defined and di&s;tributed by philo&s;ophers, whether the common di&s;tinction of them into the under&s;tanding and the will be founded in nature, how their &s;everal opera|tions depend upon each other, I &s;tay not to enquire. This is certain, that mankind are furni&s;hed with na|tural faculties &s;ufficient for the performance of what|ever duty is required of them. Their impotency con|&s;i&s;ts in the want of a &s;econdary power, a habit or principle di&s;po&s;ing them to holy affections &amp; actions; the origin of which defect I will endeavour briefly to declare.</P>
<P>Man was originally created upright. His &s;oul was furni&s;hed not only with faculties &s;ufficient for what|ever duty God required of him, but al&s;o with princi|ples and habits enabling and prompting him to obe|dience. He had a power both to will and to do. There was a foundation in the moral &s;tate and frame of his &s;oul for tho&s;e affections, and that behaviour to which he was bound by the law of his creation. And
<PB N="27" REF="012416_0031_0F8974EF37A80818">
though he was dependent upon God in all his opera|tions, yet it was as really in the power of his own will, as furni&s;hed with principles of righteou&s;ne&s;s, to act righteou&s;ly, as it was in the power of his will as a natural faculty to act at all. And as he might truly be &s;aid to have a power to act, though not indepen|dent in its exerci&s;e upon God's providential concur|rence, &s;o he had a power to act righteou&s;ly, though not independent on the divine co-operation, as the original &s;ource of moral perfection. He needed but to act according to his nature, and exerci&s;e tho&s;e faculties and principles he was endowed with in his creation, in order to maintain his innocency and happine&s;s. Capable he was indeed by rea&s;on of the mutability of his finite nature of being deceived and falling into &s;in, as from fact is &s;adly evident; but he was not nece&s;&s;itated to it through any defect of natural &s;trength or rectitude. But by voluntarily neglecting to follow nature in its &s;uperior principles, and obey the dictates of the divine law written on his heart, he (as it were) ca&s;t away that divine perfection and glory of his nature, and blotted out the &s;acred impre&s;&s;ion of God's moral image from his heart. The natural faculties with the inferior habits, which in all their exerci&s;es and operations ought to be &s;ubordinate to that &s;overeign &s;uperior perfective principle of human nature, being thus left to operate alone, human nature became immediately depraved. An amazing revo|lution took place in the &s;oul of man, con&s;i&s;ting in no le&s;s than a change of its ultimate and highe&s;t end of action; a revolution re&s;embling the change in a po|litical body, revolting from its lawful King, placing an u&s;urping &s;ubject in his throne, and transferring to him that love, honour, obedience and tribute, which is due from a &s;ubject to his prince.</P>

To &s;ay then that the authority of a law her whol|ly in the threatning, is the &s;ame thing as to &s;ay that the threat|ning of the law is all that obliges the &s;ubject to obedience; and con&s;equently if the threatning or threatned puni&s;hment could be avoided, it would no longer be our duty to obey the law. And for any one to be freed from the penalty of the law, is the &s;ame thing as to be freed from the authority or obligation of the law. But &s;urely this is a very un&s;ound prin|ciple. It is indeed gro&s;s hobbi&s;m. The very dregs of an|tinomiani&s;m. According to this principle believers are not &s;ubject to the authority of the law, for they are not &s;ubject to the penalty or threatning. The authority of a law is pre&s;up|po&s;ed in the threatning, for if the &s;ubject were not bound in duty to obey the law, &s;eparate from, and antecedent to the con&s;ideration of the threatned penalty, it would be unju&s;t to threaten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, and more unju&s;t to puni&s;h him for not obeying. Nor it is true that the authority of the law appears only in the threatning. For then the mo&s;t unrighteous laws may appear to have as much authority or right to command obe|dience as any; &s;ince they may be enforced with penalties; But they have no authority at all; nor do they appear to have any to tho&s;e who judge of them by right rules. The authority or binding power of a law, con&s;i&s;ts primarily and principally in the&s;e two things, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law it|&s;elf, and the right of the legi&s;lator to enact it: And whatev|er obligation the penalty lays upon the &s;ubject, is but a &s;ubor|dinate and &s;econdary one. It is rather an obligation of inter|e&s;t than of duty. The authority of a law giver con&s;i&s;ts in his right to require obedience under penalty; and whatever it be that gives any one this right, one thing is evident, that it is not mere|ly a power of threatning and puni&s;hing&mdash;Whatever makes it manife&s;t that any one has the right of legi&s;lation, in that alone does his authority appear; but the bare exerci&s;e of power, which is all that appears merely in commanding threatning and puni&s;hing, does not make it appear that any one has right, unle&s;s we are &s;o ab&s;urd as to found right meerly in irre&s;i&s;table power.</NOTE></P>

which comprehends the whole duty of man, formally con&s;i&s;ts. And therefore to under&s;tand the nature of holine&s;s, we mu&s;t know what the divine law requires of us.

<P>Whatever appears either by the light of nature, or &s;upernatural revelation to be the will of God, is con|tained in the precept of the divine law. More par|ticularly, our duty may be &s;ummed up in three words, right <HI>habits, affections</HI> and <HI>actions.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) The divine law extends to the habits and prin|ciples of the &s;oul, requiring a &s;econdary power, promptitude and readine&s;s for &s;uch exerci&s;es and acts as are holy and good. Holine&s;s comprehends a recti|tude of nature, as well as action. This is what we under&s;tand by that &s;tate of integrity in which the &s;criptures teach us that man was at fir&s;t created; which is called uprightne&s;s, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, where|by is &s;ignified an agreement or conformity to the rule of God's law&mdash;And the privation or defect of this rectitude of nature is therefore &s;in, being an irregu|larity forbidden by the law. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If habits are wholly to be re&s;olved into a divine con&s;titution, and are nothing but a law of nature (which has been intima|ted to be probably the truth of the matter by Mr. H. when examined with true philo&s;ophic metaphy&s;ic &s;trictne&s;s. Serm. on John 1.13. p. 38.) It &s;eems utterly inconceivable how there can be moral rectitude or obliquity in habits of any kind. A law of nature is nothing but a &s;tated method of di|vine operation. How then can this be moral goodne&s;s in us. Does the law require us to con&s;titute the law of nature or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ix the method of divine operation? Or does the law impute the divine con&s;titution, (which is entirely di&s;tinct from and extrin|&s;ic to our minds and all their exerci&s;es,) as virtue or vice to us? Is an act or con&s;titution of the divine being, as &s;uch, re|ally and formally our fault or virtue? Such metaphy&s;ical flights are I believe beyond the reach of mo&s;t. As to the pre|tended difficulty of forming di&s;tinct ideas of habits, perhaps there is equal difficulty in forming di&s;tinct ideas of the &s;oul or its faculties.

allowed by the author with whom I am principally concerned in this debate, (notwith&s;tanding &s;undry expre&s;&s;ions &s;cattered through his book incon&s;i&s;tent with the doctrine of original righteou&s;ne&s;s or &s;in) un|till I find him expre&s;ly denying it. But whatever rectitude of nature man was at fir&s;t en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owed with, the <HI>production</HI> of it by the creating power of God, is in order of nature prior to the <HI>morality of it, or it's relation to the law.</HI> The creating efficiency of God, <HI>gave being</HI> to the concreated principles of human na|ture; which was no &s;ooner made than &s;ubject to a law exactly &s;uited and proportioned to all its powers and principles; and this law <HI>gave morality and holi|ne&s;s</HI> to the&s;e principles.

<P N="2">(2.) The divine law regulates the internal or im|manent acts of the &s;oul, which according as they are conformable or repugnant to the will of God are holy or &s;inful. It has been di&s;puted among learned divines whether moral rectitude or obliquity, belongs to the acts both of the under&s;tanding and will, or merely to the acts of the will. Whether the acts of the un|der&s;tanding are governed by the will, or the acts of the will by the under&s;tanding, which acts fir&s;t, &amp;c.

The&s;e things I leave to tho&s;e who have a mind to di&s;pute about g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at's wool. After propo&s;ing one query to their con&s;ideration, viz. Whether any act or idea of the human mind can po&s;&s;ibly be conceived of, which does not include &s;ome ta&s;te or perception of the object as good or evil? Or in other words, whether there is the lea&s;t evidence that there is or ever was any &s;uch faculty as what is called under|&s;tanding di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct from the heart? Every act of the &s;oul is (I &s;uppo&s;e) under the government of the di|vine law. Tho&s;e who have a natural capacity, with outward advantages for knowing God and under|&s;tanding his will, their ignorance is a &s;inful defect. Right affections are al&s;o by the con&s;ent of all compre|hended in the duty pre&s;cribed in the divine law. The love of God and our neighbour is &s;poken of in &s;crip|ture as a kind of &s;ummary of the duty of man. On the two commandments requiring love, hang all the law and the prophets.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The law of God extends to actions, or effect|ive acts of the &s;oul, which are &s;ometimes called im|pera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e acts of the will, producing a real effect ex|trin&s;ic to the active faculty. The affections or im|manent acts of the &s;oul do not effect any thing, or have any cau&s;al influence without the mind. But the effective acts of the &s;oul are productive of &s;ome work, or external action. Now the law of God pre&s;cribes rules of behaviour to men, requiring them to do as well as love what is good. It commands us not only to know and love God, but to &s;hew forth his prai&s;e, to glorify him, and walk in his ordinances, <HI>to cau&s;e our light to &s;hine before men, that others may &s;ee our good works.</HI> Not only to love our neighbour, but to carry it ju&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and kindly to him in &s;peech and behaviour.

<P>This may &s;uffice for a general view of the duty required of man in the divine law&mdash;<HI>Rectitude of na|ture, affection, and practice, comprehends whatever belongs to the nature of holine&s;s.</HI> All the&s;e things are commanded, and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>But to have ju&s;t and determinate conceptions of this matter, there are &s;ome important remarks and di&s;tinc|tions nece&s;&s;ary to be attended to.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Holine&s;s is in &s;cripture and in the common language of chri&s;tians con&s;idered as an adjunct, or property both of per&s;ons and actions: and there is &s;ome difference in the complex idea &s;ignified by the word <HI>holine&s;s,</HI> according as it is applied to per&s;ons, or their actions, which &s;hould be carefully noted. A holy per&s;on is a <HI>&s;aint,</HI> one who&s;e heart and life are conformable to the rule of his duty, who&s;e moral character, that is, his principles, affections, and be|haviour, are an&s;werable to God's preceptive will. An affection or action is holy when it is in all re&s;pects &s;uch as the divine law requires. If there be any de|fect in <HI>a man's moral character,</HI> it is not ab&s;olutely holy, though in &s;ome particulars it may be good. And if there be any moral defect in <HI>an action</HI> it is not ab&s;olutely holy, though in &s;ome re&s;pects it may be good, or may have &s;ome goodne&s;s in or belonging to it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>As there are good actions which have &s;in adhering to them, &s;o there are &s;ins that have good in them.

<PB N="37" REF="012416_0041_0F8974F776251D50">
in the conjunction of every virtue, act and work requi|red in the divine commandment. The holine&s;s of any particular action does not con&s;i&s;t either in the work wrought, or in the manner, or any particular circum|&s;tances of the performance, <HI>&s;eperately or in it&s;elf con|&s;idered,</HI> but in the conjunction or concurrence, of the goodne&s;s of the action in it&s;elf with the goodne&s;s of its circum&s;tances and manner of performance.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The di&s;tinction between legal and evangelical holine&s;s mu&s;t al&s;o be noted. <HI>Legal holine&s;s is that which perfectly an&s;wers the requirement of the law in every re&s;pect. Evangelical holine&s;s, though defective in the eye of the law, is yet &s;o far an&s;werable to the rule of duty as that according to the gracious con&s;titu|tion of the new covenant it is through the mediation of Chri&s;t, acceptable ond rewardable by God; and is pro|portioned and adapted to tho&s;e ends for the &s;ake of which it is required in the go&s;pel.</HI> A per&s;on or action is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> unholy i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it be in any degree inconformable to the law of God. It is evangelically unholy if de|ficient in any thing nece&s;&s;ary to acceptance with God according to the new covenant. No human per&s;on or action is to be found in this world that is legally holy. Evangelical holine&s;s is found in different de|grees in the <HI>character</HI> of all true chri&s;tians, and in <HI>&s;ome of their affections and performances:</HI> but it is not found in the unregenerate or any of their actions.</P>
<P>Here then is the great point to be re&s;olved, viz. What is the nature of evangelical holine&s;s? Which agreable to the di&s;tinction abovementioned may be divided into two enquiries. <HI>What is e&s;&s;entially impli|ed in the character of a holy or good man in the go&s;|pel acceptation?</HI> And <HI>what is nece&s;&s;arily required in any act to con&s;titute it evangelically holy, or &s;piritual|ly good?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="012416_0042_0F8974F83236ACE0">The general and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential difference between the character of a &s;aint and &s;inner in the go&s;pel &s;en&s;e con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the&s;e things. The true &s;aint is one who is regenerate, or endowed with a &s;upernatural vital principle, with habitual power for holy acts. Being by faith united to Chri&s;t he receives from him &s;upplies of grace, vital communications, in order to his furtherance in holine&s;s and comfort. As to the exerci&s;es of a principle of holine&s;s in faith, hope, love and good works, the&s;e are an e&s;&s;ential part of the cha|racter of a good man. It is not indeed e&s;&s;ential to a &s;tate of evangelical holine&s;s that grace be at all times in actual exerci&s;e. A habit of holine&s;s will not how|ever in adult per&s;ons remain dormant long at a time. It will in various degrees prevail, and have a govern|ing influence into the practice, yet not &s;o as to exclude danger of great degrees of apo&s;tacy in time of temp|tation. This is that &s;eed of God which &s;hall never utterly die or peri&s;h in any &s;oul where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce planted. Though a &s;aint may for a time fail in the acts, he &s;hall not finally fall from the &s;tate of holine&s;s. Here then lies the e&s;&s;ential univer&s;al difference. Whatever good gifts or virtuous endowments the minds of the unregenerate may be furni&s;hed with, and however u&s;eful and amiable their lives may be, yet they are unable to will or do any thing &s;piritually good. And however the true chri&s;tian may fail in acts of holy obedience, that divine nature of which he is made a partaker remains in him.</P>
<P>To re&s;olve the other enquiry, viz. What is required in any act to con&s;titute it an act of go&s;pel holine&s;s there will be need of more con&s;ideration. That I may open this point as plainly and fully as I can in a few words, I would premi&s;e a few things concerning the habitual principle of holine&s;s, which is the &s;ubjective ground of all acts of evangelical obedience, &s;hewing
<PB N="39" REF="012416_0043_0F8974F9C2D5C4E0">
wherein this is different from natural principles. As this is a &s;ecret hidden work, it &s;eems &s;carce capable of being otherwi&s;e di&s;cribed than by its &s;ubject, its efficient cau&s;e, its end, and effects. The receptive &s;ubject is the whole &s;pirit, &s;oul and body, all the powers or faculties of human nature. The efficient cau&s;e is the holy Spirit, creating and infu&s;ing a vital principle, with a power and promptitude for holy exerci&s;es. The end whereof is to prepare a living temple, wherein to take up his everla&s;ting re&s;idence: to fit the &s;ubject for &s;uch exerci&s;es and acts as are required in the go&s;pel, and are &s;uitable and nece&s;&s;ary for that new &s;tate to which he is called, that he may bring forth the fruit of new obedience, to the glory of God's grace, the honour of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his go&s;pel, the good of mankind, the pre&s;ent comfort, and eternal &s;alvation of his own &s;oul. The effects are a &s;piritual change in his apprehen&s;ions, affections, enjoyments, aims, and endeavours: dying to &s;in, living to God, in the daily exerci&s;e of repentance, faith, love and good works.</P>
<P>This leads us to con&s;ider the nature of tho&s;e acts which flow from that &s;upernatural habit or principle above de&s;cribed; in other words what is requi&s;ite to con&s;titute an action &s;piritually good, and according to the evangelical covenant acceptable to God? and <HI>in the fir&s;t place,</HI> all acts of acceptable obedience im|ply or pre&s;uppo&s;e the per&s;on to be in a &s;tate of re|conciliation with God. This indeed is not properly a qualification of the action, but the agent: and that not an inherent, but relative qualification, yet it is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The promi&s;es and ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant belong only to tho&s;e who are in the coven|ant. Till a &s;inner is ju&s;tified, his being in a &s;tate of guilt is an effectual bar to the acceptance of his per|formances as rewardable with covenant ble&s;&s;ings.
<PB N="40" REF="012416_0044_0F8974FACBB3C5F8">
God accepts us, and has a gracious re&s;pect to us, in and through the mediator of the new covenant, be|fore he accepts or re&s;pects any of our works as acts of go&s;pel holine&s;s.</P>
<P>Secondly, All acts of go&s;pel holine&s;s mu&s;t in them|&s;elves be conformable to the divine command. The work done, the <HI>opus operatum</HI> mu&s;t be a command|ed action, and not a mere human invention. This is what is meant by the &s;ub&s;tance and matter of duty, about which Mr. H. appears to be &s;o bewildered, and talks in &s;uch an extraordinary &s;train, as if &s;omething mu&s;t needs be intended extrin&s;ic to, and di&s;tinct from the act of the &s;oul or agent. This was rather too gro&s;s a mi&s;take. One would &s;carce have expected that Mr. Hopkins, would need to be informed that by the &s;ub&s;tance or matter of an action is meant <HI>the action as ab&s;tracted from its circum&s;tances,</HI> and not any con&s;equent effects di&s;tinct from it. Whatever ab&s;urdity there is in calling the locomotion of body ab&s;tract from the agency of the &s;oul the &s;ub&s;tance or matter of duty, him&s;elf (I &s;uppo&s;e) is author of it. If &s;ome &s;peaking in popular &s;tile have called the ex|ternal effects immediately connected with the act of the mind as their cau&s;e, and flowing from it accord|ing to the laws of nature, by the name of external ac|tions, duties, or &s;ins, it was becau&s;e on account of this connection they are con&s;idered as virtually compre|hended in, and the &s;ame with the act of the mind: not that they ever dreamed that the mere motion of matter &s;eparate from the agency of the mind has any morality in it. It is the act it&s;elf commanded to be done that is the matter of duty. It is the act of the will <HI>ad extra,</HI> productive of an external work required in the divine law, that is the &s;ub&s;tance and matter of external duty. I &s;ay then, no action however quali|fied or circum&s;tanced is holy, if the act it&s;elf, as to
<PB N="41" REF="012416_0045_0F8974FB32A54178">
the &s;ub&s;tance and matter of it, be not commanded, or conformable to the rule of duty.</P>
<P>Thirdly, All acts of holine&s;s mu&s;t flow from right principles. An action taken nakedly in it&s;elf may bear &s;ome conformity to the divine command, and yet be &s;o deficient in its cau&s;es and principles as to be unholy. The &s;ame <HI>effective</HI> acts of the &s;oul may be educible from very different principles. Two &s;er|vants may be equally attentive, and in the &s;ame way, to plea&s;e their ma&s;ter; while the one acts from love, the other from &s;lavi&s;h fear. An unregenerate &s;inner and a true &s;aint may do the &s;ame kind of actions, con&s;idered in them&s;elves; the one from holy, the other from mere natural principles. The principles of holy obedience are (1.) A divine nature, a new heart, a &s;upernatural habit communicated in regene|ration. (2.) A true faith in God, in Chri&s;t, in the divine word, precepts, promi&s;es, and threatnings, wherein are contained the rule and motives of evan|gelical obedience. (3.) The &s;pecial influence of the holy Spirit dwelling within us, exciting, a&s;&s;i&s;ting, and co-operating with us, working in us both to will and to do what is acceptable to God. To which may be added with re&s;pect to effective acts, (4.) Love, the greate&s;t of chri&s;tian graces, without which we with all our endowments and works are nothing.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Acts of go&s;pel holine&s;s mu&s;t be directed to a right end. A defect here will corrupt the be&s;t performances. Many good actions done by believers, in&s;tead of being accepted and rewarded in the world to come, will be burnt up as hay and &s;tubble, becau&s;e not done for an holy end. The ends of holy obe|dience are, Fir&s;t, the glorifying and plea&s;ing God: Secondly, the &s;alvation of our own &s;ouls: Thirdly, the be&s;t good of mankind. To the&s;e all inferior ends mu&s;t be &s;ubordinated, without which, however good
<PB N="42" REF="012416_0046_0F8974FBF40100E8">
and lawful in them&s;elves, they become irregular and inordinate; but by being &s;ought in their proper place are &s;anctified to us. Fifthly. There are other cir|cum&s;tances, &s;uch as the manner, time, place, &amp;c. of the action which mu&s;t be rightly ordered according to the divine command. A gro&s;s defect or irregu|larity in the&s;e re&s;pects, may &s;o deform an otherwi&s;e good action, that it is rather to be accounted a &s;in than a good work. A good man may do an action materially good, and for a good end, and yet it may be &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable, &s;o mi&s;placed, &s;o out of order, and in it's circum&s;tances &s;ome how &s;o indecent and im|proper, that it may really degenerate into &s;in.</P>
<P>This then is the &s;um of the matter. Holine&s;s comprehends conformity to the command of God in re&s;pect of the matter, manner, principle, and end of action. An action's being conformable to the rule in any one of the&s;e &s;everal re&s;pects, while inconformable in the others, is not &s;ufficient to denominate it holy. So far as it is conformable to the rule of duty it is good; but not every in&s;tance of conformity to the rule is holine&s;s. When goodne&s;s of principle, end, manner, and circum&s;tances concur and concenter in an act materially good, the conjunction or coincidence of all the&s;e con&s;titute that intire conformity to the will of God which is true holine&s;s. But neither will a good end and principle &s;anctify a forbidden action, nor is the doing a commanded action an in&s;tance of holy obedience, if e&s;&s;entially defective in principle and end.</P>
<P>The divine law is a perfect rule of duty; nor is any action good or acceptable any further than it is conformable to it. And yet as was before hinted, the &s;incere obedience of true believers though far &s;hort of legal perfection is acceptable to God through the mediation of Chri&s;t. For by the grace of the go&s;pel

<P>Let it then be carefully ob&s;erved, that there are &s;ome acts of the mind which have whatever is e&s;&s;en|tial to a holy action in&s;eperably connected with, or rather involved in the &s;ub&s;tance and matter of the act.

good works are required in the divine command. Effective acts of the &s;oul are as really of the nature of holine&s;s as immanent exerci&s;es, when they are in them&s;elves, and in their circum&s;tances and qualifica|tions, conformable to the will of God. That confor|mity to the will of God which gives them the nature of holine&s;s, re&s;pects the performances, as well as the concomitant affections. And be&s;ides, there is a rectitude of nature conformable to the law, di&s;tinct from all exerci&s;es of the &s;oul whatever. This defi|nition then appears to be defective, narrow, and in|adequate. Whatever is required in the divine law, belongs to the nature of virtue, if we mean by it the &s;ame with true holine&s;s; but that &s;omething be&s;ides benevolence is required in the divine law has been in &s;ome mea&s;ure manife&s;ted, and &s;hall by God's help, be further demon&s;trated in the next &s;ection. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It may perhaps be agreable to &s;ome readers to have this point &s;tated a little more metaphy&s;ically. We may then ob&s;erve, that virtue (that is holine&s;s) is a word which may be taken ei|ther in an ab&s;tract or concrete &s;en&s;e; and may in either of tho&s;e &s;en&s;es be defined. Virtue in the ab&s;tract, or virtuou&s;ne&s;s is a <HI>quality of &s;ome habit or act</HI> of a moral agent. Virtue in the concrete is a <HI>qualified habit or act.</HI> In the ab&s;tract, it is <HI>conformity to the law.</HI> In the concrete it is <HI>a habit or act con|formable to the law.</HI> Virtue in the ab&s;tract, has for it's <HI>&s;ub|ject</HI> &s;ome habit or act required in the law. And it's <HI>formal rea&s;on</HI> which is all that can be meant by <HI>it's e&s;&s;ence</HI> is it's <HI>agree|ment with the law.</HI> Virtue in the concrete, has for it's <HI>&s;ub|ject</HI> a moral agent, its <HI>&s;ub&s;tance or matter</HI> is &s;ome habit or act conformable to the law, it's <HI>form</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the conformity thereof to the law. It appears then that to &s;ay the e&s;&s;ence of virtue con&s;i&s;ts in benevolence, is not an exact definition, whe|ther we take the word virtue <HI>ab&s;tractly</HI> or <HI>concretely.</HI> Vir|tue in the <HI>ab&s;tract</HI> is not benevolence&mdash;for benevolence is an act or habit, but virtuou&s;ne&s;s is neither act nor habit, but the conformity thereof to the law. Benevolence is one in&s;tance of virtue <HI>in the concrete &s;en&s;e,</HI> and an important one, but not the only one. Virtue in this &s;en&s;e con&s;i&s;ts e&s;&s;entially not only in benevolence, but in every other act or habit duly conform|able to the law of God.</P>
<P>And as virtue may be defined from it's relation to the divine law as it's <HI>perfect and adequate rule,</HI> &s;o it may al&s;o be defined from it's <HI>re&s;pect to the highe&s;t good,</HI> or the good of the univer&s;e, which is (as we may &s;ay) the original rea&s;on and foundation of the divine law. The highe&s;t good of the univer&s;e may be con&s;idered as a mea&s;ure or &s;tandard by which to try whether any thing be truly and &s;imply good. And accordingly true virtue may be defined either <HI>in the ab&s;tract</HI>&mdash;is the agreement and con&s;ent of the habits and acts of the mind with the good of the univer&s;e, or <HI>in the concrete,</HI> as the habits and acts of the mind agreeing and con&s;enting with the good of the univer&s;e. It is in this way that Mr. Edwards aims to define the nature of true virtue in his di&s;&s;ertation on that &s;ubject. But as I humbly conceive, has not done it with accuracy and exact|ne&s;s. All his definitions are in the <HI>concrete,</HI> but they are nei|ther adequate to the &s;ubject, nor &s;carce con&s;i&s;tent with each other. Sometimes he &s;ays that true virtue con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>benevo|lence to being in general</HI>&mdash;&s;ometimes it is <HI>a con&s;ent, propen&s;ity and union of heart,</HI> to being in general, that is <HI>immediately ex|erci&s;ed</HI> in a general good will. Which is to me a very dark &s;entence, nor can I determine whether this con&s;ent, propen&s;ity, &amp;c. means an <HI>act or habit.</HI> A little after he &s;ays that his meaning is that the nature of true virtue con&s;i&s;ts in a <HI>di&s;po|&s;ition</HI> to benevolence towards being in general, and again that no affections towards particular per&s;ons or beings are of the nature of true virtue but <HI>&s;uch as ari&s;e from a generally bene|volent temper,</HI> or from that <HI>habit</HI> and <HI>frame</HI> of mind wherein con&s;i&s;ts a di&s;po&s;ition to love being in general. And once more all virtue con&s;i&s;ts <HI>in that affection of heart</HI> to being <HI>which is exerci&s;ed</HI> in benevolence or an inclination to it's good. Does there not appear to be great perplexity and embarra&s;|ment in the&s;e definitions? Sometimes we are told that the e&s;&s;ence of virtue con&s;i&s;ts in an <HI>affection,</HI> &s;ometimes in a <HI>habit</HI> di&s;po&s;ing to that affection, &s;ometimes in &s;omething we can hard|ly tell whether <HI>habit or affection,</HI> &s;ometimes it &s;eems in <HI>both habits and affections</HI>&mdash;&s;ometimes all virtue con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>an affection exerci&s;ed in an affection:</HI> And as for <HI>actions</HI> or <HI>effective acts</HI> they &s;eem to be quite overlooked and forgotten, as if they had nothing of the nature of virtue. But if we define virtue in the concrete, it is as improper to &s;ay that its e&s;&s;ence con&s;i&s;ts in this or that particular in&s;tance whether habit, affection or action, as it would be to &s;ay that the e&s;&s;ence of ju&s;tice con&s;i&s;ts in any <HI>particular exerci&s;e or act of ju&s;tice.</HI> The e&s;&s;ence of concrete vir|tue con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>every habit, affection and action</HI> conformable to the divine law, and agreeing with or favoring the general good of the univer&s;e, as has been above explained.</P></NOTE></P>

As to evangelical holine&s;s the unregenerate, though endowed with a remote power for &s;uch acts in the faculties of their mind, have not a next or habitual power for them.

It mu&s;t then be concluded that for the performance of duties in a holy &s;piritual manner, all who are in a &s;tate of irregeneracy are without &s;trength.</P>
<P>Proceed we now to the &s;econd enquiry, viz. What powers and a&s;&s;i&s;tances for action the unregenerate may be the &s;ubjects of?</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="012416_0054_0F897502CDEF0058">The que&s;tion is not concerning the primary power of action con&s;i&s;ting in the natural faculties of the &s;oul, in which re&s;pect there is no e&s;&s;ential difference between one man and another: But what &s;econdary powers or principles of action the unregenerate are endowed with, and what further helps beyond the mere powers of nature may be and are &s;ometimes afforded to them. And let it be remembred, that we do not mean to place the power of the unregenerate in any natural principles &s;eperate from &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tances by the outward di&s;pen&s;ation of the word, and inward in|fluence of the Spirit of God; but we &s;ay that from the concurrence of all the&s;e there ari&s;es an immediate or next power for the performance of &s;uch actions, as we &s;hall afterwards &s;hew are required in the word of God.</P>
<P>To in&s;tance in &s;ome particulars: The unregene|rate are able from natural principles, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by in|&s;truction, and the influence of the holy Spirit, to re|form their lives, to purpo&s;e, &s;peak and do many things materially good, wherein the &s;ub&s;tance of effective acts of obedience is contained. They have a power to attend to the reading and preaching of God's word, and pray to him for his &s;aving mercy: And to do this in &s;uch a manner as is in &s;ome re&s;pects agreable to the divine command; that is, &s;eriou&s;ly and con&s;cienciou&s;ly: With a deep concern to e&s;cape the mi&s;ery of a &s;tate of &s;in and guilt: With a con|viction of con&s;cience (and a ju&s;t one too) that God has commanded, and encouraged them to do &s;o, and con&s;equently that it is their duty: And with &s;ome moral &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te of the fitne&s;s and rea&s;onablene&s;s of their doing the&s;e things, and of the moral turpi|tude of a contrary behaviour.</P>
<P>It is not my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to prove that &s;uch actions, and &s;uch circum&s;tances of action as have here

been mentioned, are in them&s;elves good, and com|manded by God. That will be attended to in it's proper place. What I have now to do is to &s;hew that the unregenerate have a power by the common aids of divine grace to do &s;uch actions, and in &s;uch a manner as has here been declared.</P>
<P>This appears <HI>fir&s;t from fact.</HI> They have &s;ome|times done all the&s;e things. Now as every act pre|&s;uppo&s;es a power &s;ufficient for it, it is certain that men have a principle or power for the doing of &s;uch actions as are done by them.</P>
<P>Secondly, The &s;ame may be proved <HI>a priori</HI> by taking a view of human nature, with it's powers, principles, habits, and &s;prings of action. The&s;e when directed and excited by that light and influence which may be conveyed to the mind of an unregenerate per&s;on from the word and Spirit of God, are &s;uffici|ent, without the infu&s;ion of a holy principle, to en|able him to will and do all the&s;e things.

<P>To manife&s;t this we may take a brief &s;urvey of the principles of action natural to mankind, together with tho&s;e advantages and a&s;&s;i&s;tances which in different de|grees ordinarily attend the outward di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel.

<PB N="52" REF="012416_0056_0F89750432B89A98">
principle is of a very general &s;ignification. It com|prehends whatever has a cau&s;al influence into an action.

<P N="1">1. Rea&s;on is a principle of action natural to man|kind.

When therefore we are convinced that we are ha&s;tning into the eternal world, where tho&s;e who are reconciled to God will be happy in his favour, and tho&s;e who are obnoxious to his wrath will be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de|&s;truction, and that now is the &s;ea&s;on of mercy, in which God is u&s;ing means with us, and calling us to attend on them, in order to obtain that knowledge of the way of &s;alvation, and that divine influence which may per&s;uade and enable us to an acquie&s;cence in, and con&s;ent to it; rea&s;on will dictate that it is fit and right

for us to regard our eternal intere&s;t according to it's importance; and diligently u&s;e tho&s;e outward means whereby God is wont to communicate to &s;inners the ble&s;&s;ings of his &s;pecial grace. The dictate of rea&s;on will have a tendency to determine our wills to &s;uch a conduct as it pre&s;cribes. For there is a propen&s;ity in the mind to follow the practical dictates of it's own rea&s;on; which though often controuled by &s;ome par|ticular appetite or inclination acting in oppo&s;ition thereto, will yet even when overpowered make a &s;trong re&s;i&s;tance.
<Q>The dictate of rea&s;on (&s;ays Mr. EDWARDS,) declaring what is mo&s;t for a per&s;on's happine&s;s taking in the whole of his duration, when it takes place, is one thing that is put into the &s;cales, and is to be con&s;idered as a thing which has con|cern in the compound influence which moves or in|duces the will,</Q>
&amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry concerning the will, p. 12.</NOTE> Though the &s;oul be promp|ted to the choice of it's ultimate end not by rea&s;on but by ta&s;te, yet in the choice of the means condu|cive to this end the dictate of rea&s;on has great weight to determine the will. Whether therefore it be pro|per to call rea&s;on a prompting, or only a directing principle of action, certain it is that it's dictates have a tendency to influence the conduct of mankind.

<P N="2">2. Con&s;cience is another principle of action natural to mankind. In this principle is implied a moral &s;en&s;e approving virtue and di&s;approving vice; whence ari&s;es a &s;en&s;e of de&s;ert, as an eminent writer of our own has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">EDWARDS on the nature of true virtue, chap. 5.</NOTE> That there is a moral &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te of the natural beauty of virtue and de|formity

of vice, di&s;tinct from a &s;upernatural principle of holine&s;s, may I &s;uppo&s;e be taken for granted. Now con&s;cience I &s;ay, when enlightned by the word and awakened by the Spirit of God, is both a direct|ing and prompting principle of action. It directs men what they ought to do, it repre&s;ents the obligation they are under to do it, the rea&s;onablene&s;s of comply|ing with their duty, the unfitne&s;s of a contrary beha|viour; and from a &s;en&s;e of the difference between right and wrong warns them what to expect as the ju&s;t con&s;equence of their actions. The approbation of con&s;cience implies &s;ome perception or ta&s;te of the natural beauty of virtue, and this denotes &s;ome kind of propen&s;ity in the heart to &s;uch acts as are thus ap|proved, though not a holy &s;piritual propen&s;ity to &s;piritual excellency as &s;uch. A &s;en&s;e of beauty of a|ny kind implies ta&s;te or inclination of &s;oul to it. The moral &s;en&s;e &s;hews that there is &s;omething in it's ob|ject attractive of the heart. That painful remor&s;e which is cau&s;ed by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in &s;hews that it is repugnant to &s;ome ta&s;te or inclination: For as plea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ts in the gratification of &s;ome ta&s;te or appetite, &s;o pain ari&s;es from the di&s;agreement and contrariety of it's object to &s;ome ta&s;te or appetite. When therefore an unregenerate &s;inner is convinced that it is his duty by virtue of the divine command to reform his life, and attend the means of grace; con&s;cience as a director, moral inducer to, and ap|prover of duty, will have an influence to determine the will to a compliance with it's dictates. Other natural inclinations may be too &s;trong for con&s;cience to controul, yet when it is overpowered by lu&s;t, there will be many times a hard and unea&s;y renitency.</P>
<P>But Mr. H. objects, p. 10.
<Q>Natural con&s;cience, &s;o far as it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the heart, is no principle of action at all. The heart is the &s;ource

<P>I can &s;carce &s;atisfy my&s;elf what is intended in this objection; but if I can gue&s;s at the meaning and de|&s;ign of it, it is exceeding impertinent. Natural con|&s;cience belongs to the heart, and is a principle of it, if we under&s;tand by the heart the &s;ame that is meant by it in &s;cripture. "By the heart," &s;ays Dr. Owen,

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">OWEN on apo&s;tacy, chap. 13.</NOTE> And again more particularly:
<Q>The heart generally denotes the whole &s;oul of man, and all the faculties of it, not ab&s;olutely, but as they are all one principle of moral operations, as they all concur to our doing good or evil. The mind as it enquireth, di&s;cerneth, and judgeth what is to be done, and what refu&s;ed; the will as it chu&s;eth or refu&s;eth and avoids; the affections as they like or di&s;like, cleave to, or have an aver&s;ion from that which is propo&s;ed to them; the con&s;cience as it warns and determines, are all to|gether called the heart.</Q>

We &s;uppo&s;e (and if we are wrong we would gladly be &s;et right) that natural con&s;cience is a prin|ciple of the heart or &s;oul, con&s;idered as the &s;ource of moral action.

There are &s;everal particular principles of rational and moral action in the human mind, which have their &s;everal influence into it's acts, and being joined to|gether they form <HI>one compound principle of action,</HI> which we call the heart.

<P N="3">3. Self-love is another natural principle whereby men may be prompted to reform their lives, and attend on the means of grace. This need not be proved, Mr. H. a&s;&s;erting that "the unregenerate act only from &s;elf-love." What is the proper notion of &s;elf-love, is a point that much needs to be duly &s;tated and cleared, having had &s;o large a &s;hare of grave per|plexity through the &s;ubtilties of vain philo&s;ophy. The reader will I hope pardon me if I divert a little from the main bu&s;ine&s;s in hand, to &s;et this matter in a true light.</P>
<P>It will be proper to premi&s;e &s;ome general ob&s;erva|tions concerning love, which may help us in re&s;olving our pre&s;ent enquiry concerning the nature of &s;elf-love.</P>
<P>Love being a &s;imple perception or affection of the heart, cannot properly be defined; yet it is felt and known by all men. It is commonly di&s;tingui&s;hed into two kinds, <HI>benevolence</HI> and <HI>complacence. Bene|volence is love to per&s;ons or beings capable of happine&s;s. Complacence is love to tho&s;e things which are objects of happine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Benevolence is, I think, ju&s;tly termed by Mr. Edwards, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the Nature of true Virtue, pag. 119.</NOTE>
<Q>that affection or propen&s;ity of heart to any being which cau&s;es it to incline to it's well being, or di&s;po&s;es it to de&s;ire and take plea&s;ure in it's happine&s;s.</Q>
Here we may ob&s;erve, that our love to or delight in the happine&s;s of any being is not benevolence, if this be a ju&s;t account of it, but is an immediate effect, a di&s;tinct act of the mind flowing from it. Both the <HI>object</HI> and <HI>act</HI> are different. The
<PB N="58" REF="012416_0062_0F89750985FE83F0">
<HI>object</HI> of benevolence is &s;ome perceptive being, which is di&s;tinct from the happine&s;s of the &s;ame being. The <HI>acts</HI> are al&s;o different. For we love and delight in the <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of a per&s;on, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> we love the <HI>per&s;on him&s;elf.</HI> Benevolence is &s;uch a union of &s;oul in affection to the per&s;on beloved as is a foundation or cau&s;e of a participation in the good or evil that be|fals him. Hence ari&s;es a love to, or <HI>complacency</HI> in his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Complacence is <HI>that affection we have for tho&s;e things which are agreable to &s;ome ta&s;te or appetite &s;en&s;i|tive or mental.</HI> Happine&s;s is nothing el&s;e but our <HI>enjoy|ing</HI> tho&s;e things which are <HI>objects of our complacence.</HI> Our love to the happine&s;s of tho&s;e for whom we have a benevolent affection, is our complacence in their happine&s;s. Our love of knowledge, virtue, arts, riches, honour, food, is our complacency in them. And when we have a love of complacence for per|&s;ons, it is the <HI>character or endowments</HI> of the per&s;on that is it's preci&s;e object.</P>
<P>The&s;e two di&s;tinct kinds of love being thus noted and de&s;cribed in general, I proceed to &s;ay, that bene|volence may in re&s;pect of it's object be divided into two branches, viz. <HI>Self love,</HI> and <HI>love of other percep|tive beings.</HI> It may be &s;omewhat unu&s;ual to call &s;elf-love a branch of benevolence: But as the import of the word will well bear this u&s;e of it, &s;o there are good authorities to &s;upport it. What I aim at is to di&s;tin|gui&s;h a love of good will, whether to our&s;elves or o|thers, from love of complacence, which &s;eems to have been very often in &s;ome degree confounded with it. As &s;elf-love is only benevolence to our&s;elves, the de|&s;cription of benevolence which has ju&s;t been given may be applied to &s;elf-love, viz.
<Q>It is that affection or propen&s;ity of heart to our&s;elves, which cau&s;es us to incline to our own well being, or di&s;po&s;es us to
<PB N="59" REF="012416_0063_0F89750A3054B9F8">
de&s;ire, and take plea&s;ure in our own happine&s;s.</Q>&mdash; Here then I would ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. Self-love is not properly called a love of our own happine&s;s in any &s;en&s;e. The love of happine&s;s is complacency. It has not a perceptive being for it's immediate object.</P>
<P>The love of our own happine&s;s is an ambiguous expre&s;&s;ion. Sometimes it is put for the love of that whatever it be, that is delightful, or an object of hap|pine&s;s to us. This indeed &s;eems to be an improper way of &s;peaking, amounting at bottom to no more than this, our loving what we love. The love of our own happine&s;s mo&s;t properly means <HI>a compla|cency in our own happy &s;tate, becau&s;e it is our own,</HI> ari&s;ing from benevolence to our&s;elves; even as we take complacency in the happine&s;s of tho&s;e we love becau&s;e it is theirs, they are the &s;ubjects of it. But neither love to tho&s;e things which are objects of de|light to us, nor the love of our own delight as our own is &s;elf-love, though both the one and the other have often been confounded with it. As this ought to be carefully attended to in order to conceive aright of this matter, and yet, &s;o far as I have ob&s;erved, is generally overlooked, I crave leave to con&s;ider it more di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Love to tho&s;e things which are delightful to us is intirely di&s;tinct from &s;elf-love. It will be al|lowed by tho&s;e with whom we are pre&s;ently concern|ed, that <HI>that</HI> love to, or complacency in the happi|ne&s;s of others which ari&s;es from benevolence to them, is di&s;tinct from &s;elf-love. I add, that love to any thing <HI>as an object of happine&s;s,</HI> however private or per&s;onal the plea&s;ure re&s;ulting from it may be, is <HI>toto coelo</HI> di&s;tinct from &s;elf-love. This may &s;eem a &s;trange a&s;&s;ertion to tho&s;e who have received it from eminent divines, that it is meer &s;elf-love that appears in the
<PB N="60" REF="012416_0064_0F89750AF0838E40">
di&s;po&s;ition of men to be plea&s;ed with the objects of their private and per&s;onal delight. But if we keep in mind the true notion of &s;elf-love, viz. good will to our&s;elves, we &s;hall &s;ee that there is nothing of &s;elf-love in the&s;e inclinations and affections. Both the object and act or affection are wholly different, nei|ther does the one affection flow from the other. The object of &s;elf-love is our&s;elves; the object of the&s;e appetites and inclinations is &s;omething diver&s;e from and extrin&s;ic to our&s;elves that is delightful to us. The affection of &s;elf-love is <HI>benevolence</HI> to our&s;elves: The affection we have to that which delights us, is complacency in it as a plea&s;ant good.</P>
<P>Moreover our love to, or complacency in particu|lar objects of delight, does not proceed from &s;elf-love. Self-love is not the cau&s;e why I find an immediate per|&s;onal delight in beauty, proportion, particular &s;tudies, employments, recreations, food which I may be fond of. The foundation of this delight, is a particular ta&s;te or reli&s;h for the&s;e things, and not the good will I have for my&s;elf. Self-love prompts us to &s;eek tho&s;e things which are objects or means of happine&s;s to us, but it no more creates i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> us a ta&s;te for the&s;e things, or cau&s;es us to love them, and delight in them, than i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> creates the things them&s;elves loved and de|lighted in. Nor does &s;elf-love flow from our com|placency in particular objects. Complacency in the character of per&s;ons may be a foundation of benevo|lence to them; but complacence in &s;omething di&s;tinct from our&s;elves, is not the cau&s;e of good will to our|&s;elves. Nor does &s;elf love flow from complacency in our own character, nor has any nece&s;&s;ary connection with it, as is too manife&s;t to need any proof.</P>
<P>This by the way &s;hews the fal&s;hood of that prin|ciple which Mr. H. often lays down, and builds much upon it, without once offering any thing, that I re|member,
<PB N="61" REF="012416_0065_0F89750BB36DAE10">
in the &s;hape of an argument to prove it, viz. <HI>that the unregenerate act wholly from &s;elf love.</HI> As this is no where a&s;&s;erted in &s;cripture, nor I &s;uppo&s;e, ever was, will, or can be proved, it may without pre&s;ump|tion be called in que&s;tion. To &s;ay that men natural|ly act only from &s;elf love, implies that all the natural inclinations or affections of men prompting them to action are re&s;olved into &s;elf-love: The impropriety and ab&s;urdity of which has ju&s;t been noted. Men often in their actions follow the impul&s;e of particular in&s;tincts or appetites in oppo&s;ition to their own intere&s;t on the whole, yea in oppo&s;ition to "what rea&s;on declares to be be&s;t or mo&s;t for their happine&s;s taking in the whole of their duration." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See EDWARDS on the Will, p. 12.</NOTE> Love to our own hap|pine&s;s <HI>in general,</HI> is the only love of happine&s;s that flows from &s;elf-love; and therefore &s;elf-love &s;o far as it governs the acts of our will, will always prompt us to chu&s;e and do what we think will be mo&s;t for our good upon the whole, taking in the whole of our exi&s;tence. But a regard to what we judge will be mo&s;t for our good and happine&s;s upon the whole is far from having always the whole government and determination of our wills and actions. Particular in|clinations, pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, are &s;ometimes &s;o &s;trong, that in&s;tead of &s;ubmitting to the rules and mea&s;ures which a regard to good upon the whole would pre&s;cribe, they carry the will captive as it were, and turn the &s;cale again&s;t all the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itency of &s;elf-love. Whenever a pre&s;ent plea&s;ure is preferred to a future advantage which a per&s;on judges will be greater when it comes,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem pag. 8.</NOTE> it is not a regard for our own intere&s;t up|on the whole (which is the only regard for it that flows from &s;elf-love) that determines the will in chu|&s;ing the pre&s;ent plea&s;ure. For a regard to our own
<PB N="62" REF="012416_0066_0F89750C72BF64E0">
happine&s;s upon the whole, if that were the &s;ole go|verning principle, would incline the will to the choice of that which is judged to be upon the whole mo&s;t for our advantage: But it is the &s;trength of a parti|cular inclination to the pre&s;ent plea&s;ure, intirely di&s;tinct from &s;elf-love, or a love to our general happine&s;s, which cau&s;es that plea&s;ure to appear more agreable than a greater advantage at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o many actions which flow partly from a general regard to our own happine&s;s, and partly from particular ta&s;tes or inclinations. Such as eating and drinking, acts of kindne&s;s to tho&s;e we love, of compa&s;&s;ion to the mi&s;erable, attendance on divine ordinances, and in a word all actions which may in them&s;elves give pre&s;ent plea&s;ure, and be al&s;o of ad|vantage hereafter. A regard to our own happine&s;s on the whole will al&s;o incline us to the indulgence of every appetite, when the plea&s;ure of indulgence is not followed with di&s;advantages &s;ufficient to counterba|lance it. On this account it may be difficult or im|po&s;&s;ible to determine concerning particular actions, how far we were prompted to them by appetite or <HI>particular inclination,</HI> and how far by a <HI>general re|gard</HI> to our own happine&s;s flowing from &s;elf-love. But the difference between the&s;e two principles of action is palpable; and that both have their influ|ence into our conduct is undeniable. Sometimes one is the governing principle, and &s;ometimes the other.</P>
<P>It is methinks to be regretted that the confu&s;ed unphilo&s;ophical notions of the old Epicureans, Hobbs, and the mo&s;t corrupt of the infidel writers, and that &s;trange affectation of re&s;olving all particular affections natural to mankind into &s;elf-love, in oppo&s;ition to common &s;en&s;e, &s;hould be revived among us by chri|&s;tian writers, and tho&s;e of no mean note. But to proceed,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="63" REF="012416_0067_0F89750D32F092B8">2. Love to our own happine&s;s is not &s;elf-love. This has been explained to mean complacence in our own welfare, as our own. Though this flows im|mediately and nece&s;&s;arily from &s;elf-love, and is often blended with it, yet the very terms &s;hew that both the object and affection are of a different kind. The object of &s;elf-love is <HI>my &s;elf,</HI> a perceptive being. Happine&s;s a <HI>de&s;irable good</HI> is the object of my af|fection, when I love my own happine&s;s. The af|fections I have for the&s;e different objects are al&s;o of a different kind, though both called by the name of love. The one is benevolence to my&s;elf, the other complacence in my own happine&s;s. Benevolence does not imply complacence in the per&s;on beloved, nor does complacence imply benevolence to the good beloved.</P>
<P N="3">3. Both &s;elf-love, and the love of our own happi|ne&s;s are different from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. Selfi&s;hne&s;s is a regard to our&s;elves and our own good, exclu&s;ive of all regards to others or their good. Two things are expre&s;&s;ed in this definition. Fir&s;t a love to our&s;elves and our own happine&s;s. Secondly an exclu&s;ion of love to others and their happine&s;s. Ob&s;erve here, that the exclu&s;ion or privation of love to others added to &s;elf-love changes the idea. It is adding wicked|ne&s;s to it. For the viciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts not at all in the love of our&s;elves or of our happine&s;s, but wholly in the exclu&s;ion of love to others and their happine&s;s.
<Q>Self-love is a very u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary principle in the world of mankind.</Q>
It not only conduces to their pre&s;ervation and comfort here, but <Q>in innumerable re&s;pects re&s;trains from acts of true wickedne&s;s, and puts men upon &s;eeking true vir|tue.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">EDWARDS on the Nature of Virtue, pag. 182, 18<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>

mo&s;t pernicious. This defect is the true cau&s;e of the &s;infulne&s;s of men's actions.

The di&s;orders and mi&s;eries which abound in the world through the wickedne&s;s of men, are perhaps chiefly owing to the inordinate &s;trength of particular appetites and incli|nations, ungoverned by a regard to their own gene|ral good.</P>

And whether &s;elf-love in them is &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s?</P>
<P>I have &s;hewn that men have naturally particular ap|petites and inclinations to objects di&s;tinct from them|&s;elves or their own happine&s;s; which inclinations are
<PB N="65" REF="012416_0069_0F89750EB990B1C0">
&s;ometimes &s;o &s;trong as to controul and govern &s;elf-love it&s;elf. It is now enquired whether there be in men unregenerate any love to <HI>per&s;ons</HI> di&s;tinct from &s;elf-love, and which is not educed from, and to be re&s;ol|ved into it as it's &s;ource and only principle? Some have earne&s;tly endeavoured to prove that there is not. Mr. H. though he has not offered one &s;entence that I remember tending to evince the certainty or proba|bility of what he a&s;&s;erts, is behind hand of none in con|fidently affirming, that
<Q>the unregenerate have no re|gard to any only for &s;elfi&s;h ends, and as a fruit and exerci&s;e of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.</Q>
How he confounds the ideas of &s;elf-love and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s has been noted, and &s;hall pre&s;ently be further manife&s;ted. We will put the mo&s;t candid con&s;truction to his words, and &s;up|po&s;e that by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s he means &s;elf-love. But how earne&s;tly &s;oever he may beg, or how peremptorily &s;oever he may challenge a conce&s;&s;ion, that men un|regenerate have no love or regard to any others ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pt what flows from &s;elf-love, I can by no means con&s;ent at pre&s;ent that this be taken for granted.</P>
<P>For 1. All that has been offered to prove this, &s;o far as I have hitherto ob&s;erved, tends only to &s;hew that <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> &s;elf love may be the only principle whence all tho&s;e appearances of good will and kindne&s;s to|wards others which are ob&s;ervable in mankind in ge|neral may be educed. The argument in it's full &s;trength is no more than this. It may be &s;o, therefore it is &s;o. It is po&s;&s;ible, therefore it is certain. But by what rule of logic can &s;uch a way of arguing be ju&s;ti|ed? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A po&s;&s;e ad e&s;&s;e non valet con&s;equentia.</NOTE> If it were true that all kind affections towards others <HI>may be</HI> effects of meer &s;elf-love, how will this prove that they <HI>certainly are?</HI> They may as well ari&s;e from friendly inclinations, in&s;tincts, and di&s;po&s;iti|ons implanted in human nature. The contrary never

was nor can be proved. We may then full as ju&s;tly conclude, that &s;ince the love which men have for their friends and relatives and others may ari&s;e from a particular in&s;tinct or di&s;po&s;ition of human nature di&s;tinct from &s;elf-love, therefore it does ari&s;e from &s;uch a principle, and not from meer &s;elf-love. Such an argument I know would not be conclu&s;ive; yet it would have this advantage above the other, that it would conclude agreable to the common &s;entiments of mankind. But to conclude that all unregenerate men are as &s;elfi&s;h in their kinde&s;t actions towards tho&s;e they mo&s;t love, as the mo&s;t hard hearted op|pre&s;&s;ors are in their mo&s;t uncon&s;cionable mea&s;ures to promote their private intere&s;ts, is, I dare &s;ay, con|trary to the common &s;en&s;e of fools and philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the unregenerate act merely from &s;elf-love, then we are under no obligations of gratitude to them for any acts of kindne&s;s they may do us. Children have no more rea&s;on to be thankful to their parents, however affectionate and careful for their welfare, than if they only nur&s;ed them as lambs to kill and eat them. If there be no love exerci&s;ed towards us, or kindne&s;s de&s;igned to us, except what is wholly re|duceable to love and kindne&s;s to them&s;elves, we owe no gratitude, or thanks, or recompence for it. Our obligation to gratitude is founded upon &s;ome favour done or de&s;igned to us for our &s;akes, and not wholly for the &s;ake of the benefactor. If after receiving kindne&s;&s;es from any one we find that he had no ulti|mate intention to do us good, but only to &s;erve him|&s;elf, we feel our&s;elves at once di&s;charged from the obligations of gratitude. If a man &s;hould expre&s;s the warme&s;t affections to a woman, both by words and gifts, meerly to bribe her to &s;ubmit to his will, that he might enjoy the plea&s;ure of the &s;ixth &s;en&s;e (as <HI>Scaliger</HI> calls it) by abu&s;ing her, here is no obligation
<PB N="67" REF="012416_0071_0F8975118C4DDB48">
to gratitude. If &s;elf-love be the only principle of action, and &s;elf-intere&s;t the only end ultimately aimed at, it matters not whether a man aims at advancing his wealth or honor, or plea&s;ure of any kind. If he has no ultimate intention of benefiting any but him|&s;elf, (which it is certain he has not if he acts meerly from &s;elf-love) no thanks or recompence is due for benefits conferred, how many and great &s;oever they may be. But this &s;urely is a con&s;equence not to be endured, which at one &s;troke cancels all obligations of gratitude to parents, friends, and benefactors, for all favours and kindne&s;&s;es, if they are unregene|rate. I add,</P>
<P N="3">3. That love which the unregenerate have &s;ome|times to others, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be educed from &s;elf-love. I grant there is a love to others, both a love of benevolence and complacence, which may be re|&s;olved into meer &s;elf-love as it's principle and &s;ource. Thus, &s;elf-love produces complacence in our own happine&s;s. Hence ari&s;es complacence in a character favourable to our own happine&s;s. Complacence in the character produces benevolence to the per&s;on. But &s;elf-love does not produce either benevolence or complacence towards another <HI>for his own &s;ake,</HI> but meerly in order to my own benefit. A regard to our own welfare will cau&s;e us to love what we think is conducive to it <HI>as a u&s;eful good,</HI> but not <HI>as a delight|ful good</HI>&mdash;that is, to love it as a <HI>means,</HI> but not as an <HI>end.</HI> We may from this principle love a character that is favourable to our intere&s;t, and love the happi|ne&s;s of the per&s;on, and be much delighted in it, <HI>for our own &s;akes,</HI> as a means of our own happine&s;s, but not <HI>for it's own &s;ake,</HI> as an object of happine&s;s. It is the very &s;ame kind of love which we have for a fruitful field, or a favourable &s;ea&s;on. It is true per|&s;ons do us good de&s;ignedly, whereas inanimate things
<PB N="68" REF="012416_0072_0F897511B166FCE8">
are u&s;eful without de&s;ign or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. But this makes no difference in the view of meer &s;elf-love. That will never cau&s;e us to love either the character or the happy &s;tate of any one in the lea&s;t degree in it&s;elf, or for it's own &s;ake, but only as profitable to us. Seperate the means from the end, and our re|gard for them will cea&s;e immediately and intirely, if we valued them only for the &s;ake of the end. It alters not the ca&s;e at all in this re&s;pect, whether the means of our happine&s;s are con&s;cious or not. Meer &s;elf-love will never cau&s;e us to love any per&s;on, or to de&s;ire his happine&s;s, or be plea&s;ed with it at all, as agreable in it&s;elf, but purely in order to our own inte|re&s;t, that he may &s;erve us the better; and when we expect no further advantage by his means, we &s;hall be perfectly indifferent how it fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s with him.</P>
<P>But it is evident that the unregenerate have &s;ome|times &s;uch a love to others, as cau&s;es them to have a real plea&s;ure in and concern for their welfare, &s;eparate from all hopes or pro&s;pects of being benefited by them. For it will di&s;cover it&s;elf &s;trongly in &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces where there are no &s;uch pro&s;pects. Is it not often &s;een that &s;uch when they are in their own apprehen&s;i|on ju&s;t leaving the world, and have no expectation of being any longer &s;erved by their friends, will appear as much or more concerned for them as when they had hopes of living long to enjoy them. But as to tho&s;e things which are valued only for their u&s;e, how|ever they might value them before, the pro&s;pect of having no further advantage at once cools their affecti|on, and makes them unconcerned and indifferent a|bout them. It is not mere &s;elf-love that prompts a man to expo&s;e his life to &s;ave the life of one, who he never expects will be able to make him any adequate requital; or to grieve at his misfortunes, which no o|therwi&s;e affect him than by exciting &s;ympathetic &s;or|row.
<PB N="69" REF="012416_0073_0F897512709852A8">
In &s;uch in&s;tances as the&s;e there appears a love to the happine&s;s of others as a good de&s;irable and de|lightful in it&s;elf, and not merely profitable and &s;ub&s;er|vient to &s;elf-intere&s;t, and con&s;equently &s;uch a love as cannot be educed from and re&s;olved into &s;elf-love. Which was to be proved.</P>
<P><HI>Scholium.</HI> Many things are loved partly as delight|ful in them&s;elves, and partly as u&s;eful. The welfare of our friends may be de&s;ired on both the&s;e accounts. So may reputation, honours, authority, and even rich|es; for &s;ome appear to have a fondne&s;s for them di&s;tinct from what ari&s;es from their apprehended u&s;e|fulne&s;s. But that love which terminates in it's object as in it&s;elf delightful can never be re&s;olved into &s;elf-love or a love of our own happine&s;s; and however it may be joined or compounded with a value for the &s;ame object as u&s;eful, it is in it's nature as intirely and e&s;&s;entially different from it, as the love I have for any food as plea&s;ant, is different from the love I have for it as whole&s;ome. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When a per&s;on who has been plea&s;ed with the &s;inging of a bird, or frighted with a rattle &s;nake, is delighted or di&s;gu&s;ted at the &s;ight of their pictures, this does not ari&s;e from &s;elf love. (See Edwards on the nature of true Virtue, pag. 155.) It is not &s;elf-love but a particular ta&s;te that is the immediate &s;ubjective ground of that plea&s;ure we have by &s;eeing and hearing a beautiful &s;inging bird. Nor is it &s;trange if the &s;ame ta&s;te &s;hould be &s;omewhat gratified by a lively idea of the &s;ame ob|ject.

But though this &s;eems unnece&s;&s;ary, it may not be ami&s;s to add, that it will not follow from any thing that has here been pleaded for, that mankind have naturally a principle of true holine&s;s, nor does it enervate the proofs of mans natural depravity from &s;cripture and experience. But truth &s;corns to be beholden to error for it's &s;upport, and human nature corrupt as it is may be mi&s;repre&s;ented and belied.</P>
<P>Our next enquiry, namely, whether &s;elf-love in the unregenerate is &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and whether all actions flowing from &s;elf-love are &s;elfi&s;h, and flow from a &s;elf|i&s;h principle, is now to be briefly attended to. Now though it be true that all who have &s;elf-love without any good will to others are &s;elfi&s;h per&s;ons, yet it is not &s;elf-love &s;imply that is &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, or that con&s;titutes any one a &s;elfi&s;h per&s;on. The exclu&s;ion of good will to others is e&s;&s;entially contained in the idea of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, as has ju&s;t been noted. This is a very important part of the idea, which is not included in &s;elf-love. When this vicious defect, is conjoined with &s;elf-love in our conception, the idea is changed from what it was before, and the name expre&s;&s;ing it mu&s;t be chan|ged al&s;o. It is not &s;elf-love that is &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, nor is it the want of love to others, but both together. Di|vide a whole into parts, and neither one part nor the other taken by it&s;elf is the whole.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed that men naturally act from meer &s;elf-love, it would not follow that they acted from a &s;elfi&s;h principle. An action does not flow from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s unle&s;s want of love to others as well as love to our&s;elves be a formal principle; &s;o as
<PB N="71" REF="012416_0075_0F897513F1A45020">
that what is done &s;hould be an expre&s;&s;ion or evidence of the former, as well as the latter. When a man does that to promote his own intere&s;t which is in his apprehen&s;ion incon&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;t of others, his action flows from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; it takes it's form from the want of love to others, as well as from love to him&s;elf. If he had regarded the welfare of others he would have done otherwi&s;e. But when a man aims at his own welfare in &s;uch a way as is con&s;i&s;tent with the welfare of others, &s;elf-love is the principle he acts from; it is from this his action takes it's form, and not at all from the want of love to others. It is an expre&s;&s;ion of good will to him&s;elf, it is no expre&s;&s;ion of want of love to others. Whether he had regarded the welfare of others or not, he would have done the very &s;ame that he has done. Suppo&s;e he has no re|gard to the intere&s;t of others, he is then a &s;elfi&s;h man. Suppo&s;e what he does interferes with the intere&s;t of o|thers in his apprehen&s;ion, and &s;o is an expre&s;&s;ion and evidence of want of love to them as well as of love to him&s;elf, it then flows from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, that is, it flows from want of love to others, as well as from &s;elf-love. But &s;uppo&s;e what he does be profitable to him&s;elf, and con&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;t of others, then meer &s;elf-love is the formal principle. The want of love to others has no influence in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem &s;trange to tho&s;e who are unacquainted with metaphy&s;ics, that a defect or privation &s;hould be &s;poken of as a formal principle, which has an influ|ence in it's kind into an action. To open this mat|ter fully would carry us too great a length into &s;ome ab&s;tru&s;e di&s;qui&s;itions. Though privative cau&s;es (as they are called) have no po&s;itive or phy&s;ical influence in determining the acts of the will, yet the formality of actions has a dependance upon them; and actions are very often denominated from them. The fool|i&s;hne&s;s
<PB N="72" REF="012416_0076_0F897514B2587550">
of an agent, though a meer defect, is though not a phy&s;ical, yet a logical cau&s;e, and formal princi|ple of a fooli&s;h action; which action is denominated fooli&s;h, not meerly becau&s;e it is the act of a fooli&s;h man, but becau&s;e it is an expre&s;&s;ion of folly, taking it's form as fooli&s;h from this defect in the agent. The &s;ame ob&s;ervations may be applied to &s;elfi&s;h actions.</P>
<P>An action flowing meerly from &s;elf-love is not therefore a &s;elfi&s;h action, according to the common and proper &s;ignification of the word, unle&s;s it inter|feres with the intere&s;t of others, and &s;o is an expre&s;&s;ion and evidence of a vicious defect of good will to them. It is properly an <HI>intere&s;ted</HI> action. There is accord|ing to the general acceptation of words, the &s;ame difference between an intere&s;ted and a &s;elfi&s;h action, as there is between &s;elf-love and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. Self-love is the principle of the former, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of the latter.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations may appear to &s;ome more &s;ub|til than u&s;eful. Perhaps we &s;hall find before we have done, that it is of more importance than pre&s;ently appears, to have our words and ideas as determinate as po&s;&s;ible in rea&s;oning on &s;uch points as are before us.</P>
<P>To return from this long digre&s;&s;ion. If an unre|generate &s;inner may have any ju&s;t rea&s;on to think, that his reforming his life, and attending the means of grace tends to his benefit in any re&s;pect, &s;elf-love will be a prompting principle to &s;uch a conduct; and that in &s;ome proportion to the clearne&s;s of his conviction hereof, and the &s;trength of his love to him&s;elf, and his own happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. There are other affections and inclinations natu|ral to mankind, which may influence them to a refor|mation and an attendance on the common means of grace. The natural di&s;po&s;ition in men to be plea&s;ed in being loved and honoured, and unea&s;y in being
<PB N="73" REF="012416_0077_0F89751577D07F78">
the objects of contempt and abhorrence, tends to ex|cite them to the practice of tho&s;e virtues which are of good report, and re&s;train from a di&s;&s;olute life con|&s;ured by mankind. This plea&s;ure and trouble though private does not flow from &s;elf-love, as &s;ome have imagined; but from a particular inclination of human nature. For a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being beloved by o|thers, is in it&s;elf delightful to us, and the contrary grievous. But (as has been &s;hewn) love to our&s;elves and our own happine&s;s will never cau&s;e us to delight in any particular object for it's own &s;ake, but only as a means, and for the &s;ake of a further end. Other particular affections and in&s;tincts might be mentioned tending to re&s;train men from a profligate life, and di&s;po&s;e them to a contrary behavior, which I omit. Yet I cannot forbear mentioning that inqui&s;itive turn of mind, that thir&s;t after knowledge, for which &s;ome are remarkable, and all I &s;uppo&s;e have &s;omething of it, by which many are prompted to &s;eek after divine knowledge, and &s;earch for it in the u&s;e of means as for hid trea&s;ure. Many who have no principle of true holine&s;s take a real plea&s;ure in &s;earching the &s;crip|tures, informing their minds with a doctrinal know|ledge of the principles of chri&s;tian religion, and the evidences of it's divine authority, in attending on divine ordinances, &amp;c. There is a mental ta&s;te in|clining hereto, which is di&s;tinct from &s;elf-love, though this may have a joint influence with it.</P>
<P>From the whole it appears that the unregenerate are furni&s;hed with &s;uch principles of action, as with the advantages of in&s;truction from the word of God, by the common influence of his Spirit, are &s;ufficient to enable them to reform their lives, and attend the com|mon means of grace. They have a principle or next power from which by mere moral &s;ua&s;ion &s;uch acts of will may be educed.</P>

There is no want of primary power nece&s;&s;ary to the&s;e purpo&s;es, either in the profligate or unregenerate.

<P>The inability of the unregenerate to turn to God immediately con&s;i&s;ts in his unregeneracy. That is, the want of a principle of true holine&s;s, a &s;econdary power, or next capacity of being per&s;uaded by mo|tives and arguments to turn from &s;in to God, as has been declared at large.</P>
<P>To the other enquiry, viz. Whether the inability of the profligate to reform his life be of the &s;ame kind with the inability of the unregenerate to turn to God? I an&s;wer, it &s;eems very plain that it is not. For,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The profligate has a real and proper ability to reform his life, being endowed with natural faculties, and habitual principles &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e, but the unregenerate are really and truly unable, (as de&s;ti|tute of a principle of holine&s;s) to perform acts of ho|ly obedience.</P>
<P>The profligate is as really able to reform his life as Adam was to maintain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s integrity, or as a regene|rate per&s;on is to comply with any of the precepts of the go&s;pel. Adam had a power to obey the law of his creation. He had natural faculties, and conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed principles of righteou&s;ne&s;s The regenerate have al&s;o a power for acts of &s;piritual obedience communicated to them by the holy Spirit. And mankind in gene|ral have it in their power to ab&s;tain from acts of open wickedne&s;s and practi&s;e external duties. There may be a power &s;ufficient for an action, and yet the action may never be done. There may be a natural facul|ty and habitual principle, and yet they may never be excited, or put forth to action. The proper u&s;e of moral &s;ua&s;ion is to work upon ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e powers and
<PB N="77" REF="012416_0081_0F89751932025670">
&s;prings of action which are within us, to put them in motion, or wake them up to their proper exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>But the unregenerate have not a next power or principle of holy exerci&s;es. Mere moral &s;ua&s;ion is in|&s;ufficient to prevail with them to turn to God with all their hearts, until a new heart is created in them. They have not the &s;ame kind of power herefor that Adam had to obey the law of his creation. They have not the &s;ame kind of power that the regenerate have to turn to God. They have not the &s;ame kind of power that men have to do common actions. A|dam had &s;uch a power as implied an habitual princi|ple of righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o have the regenerate. But this is wanting in the unregenerate.</P>
<P>When men have natural faculties and habitual principles, implying an immediate capacity of being wrought upon merely by the propo&s;al of motives, unwillingne&s;s to act is very improperly called inabi|lity; or however it is an inability of a very different kind from that which con&s;i&s;ts in the want of <HI>habitual principles.</HI> The pro&s;ligate is unwilling to reform, but by in&s;tructions and exhortations he may be per&s;uaded to it without having any new principle infu&s;ed into him. The unregenerate are not only unwilling to perform acts of holy obedience, but are de&s;titute of a &s;econdary power herefor, which no in&s;tructions or ex|hortations can furni&s;h them with, without the &s;pecial and immediate influence of the divine Spirit. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To what has been before remai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed concerning the di&s;tinction of natural and moral inability, I will here add a brief note for the further elucidation of this m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter.</P>
<P>Divines have taken occa&s;ion to &s;pea of three kinds of inability in man with re&s;pect to &s;uppo&s;ed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tions. Fir&s;t, When the action &s;uppo&s;ed exceeds the &s;trength <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the active <HI>faculty</HI> in it's pre|&s;ent &s;tate, this is called &s;imply <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atural inability.</HI> Thus man is naturally unable to fly above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e clouds, to create a world, to comprehend the nature or works of God. Secondly, When an action which does not exceed the &s;trength of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> natural fa|culties has a nece&s;&s;ary dependence upon, and flows from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ome preceding act of the will, as an effect from it's cau&s;e, this pre|ceding and cau&s;al act of will has b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en con&s;idered as a <HI>power</HI> with relation to the &s;ub&s;equent <HI>act</HI> flowing from it; and the want of <HI>this</HI> has been called an <HI>inability</HI> with re&s;pect thereto. <HI>Unwillingne&s;s</HI> has in this ca&s;e been termed <HI>moral inability.</HI> When this unwillingne&s;s takes place in a &s;oul furni&s;hed with a principle whence the <HI>cau&s;al act</HI> before mentioned may by in&s;tructions and motives be educed, it is then &s;imply <HI>moral in|ability,</HI> and is removed by moral &s;ua&s;ion alone, without com|municating any new principles. But Thirdly, When the prin|ciple or habit whence the &s;uppo&s;ed act mu&s;t flow is wanting, and it is not in the power of the will to acquire it, but it mu&s;t be communicated and infu&s;ed by the divine Spirit (as is the ca&s;e with the unregenerate with re&s;pect to acts of true holine&s;s) this con&s;titutes a third kind of inability which has not unfitly been called <HI>Ethico-phy&s;ical.</HI> A m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n is under a natural inabi|lity to read the &s;criptures, if he be b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d. He is under a moral inability to do &s;o, if he be unwilling when he is immediately capable of doing it. But he is under an Ethico-phy&s;ical ina|bility to di&s;cern &s;piritual things in a &s;piritual manner, and turn to God with all his heart, while he is unregenerate. Many others of late, be&s;ides Mr. H. have confounded the&s;e two latter kinds of inability together under the name of moral in|ability, contrary to the received language of the &s;criptures and &s;ound divines; though the di&s;tinction between them be as important and nece&s;&s;ary, as the di&s;tinction between the want of power and the want of will; which has introduced va&s;t confu&s;ion, perplexity, incon&s;i&s;tency, and impertinence into their di&s;cour&s;es. Hence we have &s;een &s;ome (who appear to di&s;cour&s;e very &s;en&s;ibly upon other points) that when they come to &s;peak of the inability of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> man, think that all difficulties are clearly adn &s;ufficiently &s;olved, by &s;aying that it is a moral inability, or want of will to do their duty. And common &s;en&s;e declares that unwillingne&s;s is no excu&s;e. But indeed this does not touch the core of the matter. If mankind are born with a principle or habit fitting and di&s;po&s;ing them, upon the propo&s;al of motives and occa&s;ions, for acts of holy obedi|dence no pelagian will plead unwillingne&s;s as any excu&s;e of di&s;obedience. But if this habit be wantnig, and cannot be created by any act of our will, then the inability of man con|&s;i&s;ts in a want of <HI>power</HI> to will, prior to <HI>any volitions whatever.</HI></P></NOTE></P>

<P N="3">3. If the profligate &s;inner were under the &s;ame kind of inability to reform, that the unregenerate &s;inner is under to repent and turn to God with all his heart, then the &s;ame kind of operation of divine grace which is nece&s;&s;ary to the conver&s;ion of the unregenerate would al&s;o be nece&s;&s;ary to the reformation of the pro|fligate: And the &s;ame kind of means which are &s;uffi|cient to reform the profligate, would be &s;ufficient to convert the unregenerate.

<P>That which &s;eems to have deceived our author and others in their rea&s;onings, is the ambiguity of the word will; which &s;ignifies both the power and the act of willing; and confounding &s;imple moral inability, con|&s;i&s;ting in unwillingne&s;s, with that inability which is termed by divines <HI>ethico phy&s;ical,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting in the want of a principle or next power to will.</P>
<P>The inability of the profligate to reform, &s;o far as it con&s;i&s;ts in unwillingne&s;s, is &s;imple moral inability; and is not properly and upon the whole any impo|tency at all, &s;o long as the mind is furni&s;hed with a principle or next power to will and do whatever is implied in his reformation, and only needs to have this power excited and drawn forth into acts by in|&s;truction and motives.</P>
<P>But the inability of the unregenerate to repent and turn to God, lies in the want of a &s;econdary power to will, which he is truly and properly unable to produce or create in his own &s;oul, nor can it be produced by motives alone, becau&s;e it does not con&s;i&s;t in, or flow
<PB N="81" REF="012416_0085_0F89751C32993388">
from any act of his will, but mu&s;t be communicated and infu&s;ed by the immediate agency of the holy Spirit creating in him a new heart. If a &s;inner's in|ability for holy acts con&s;i&s;ted in his unwillingne&s;s for them, or the oppo&s;ition of his will to them, then it would not con&s;i&s;t in his unregeneracy. For unrege|neracy does not lie in any actings of the will, or in the privation of any acts, but in the privation of a principle of holine&s;s. To &s;ay that the <HI>only rea&s;on</HI> why a &s;inner does not embrace the go&s;pel is becau&s;e his heart op|po&s;es it, is the &s;ame as to &s;ay that his rejecting the go&s;pel is the only rea&s;on why he rejects it, which is fal&s;e and ab&s;urd. <HI>It is fal&s;e,</HI> for it implies that there is no want of a holy principle. If a power to will were wanting, this defect would be a bar in the way of a &s;inner's conver&s;ion, of much greater moment than mere unwillingne&s;s, which if that were all might be removed by moral &s;ua&s;ion. If unwillingne&s;s, or oppo&s;ite actings of will are the <HI>only rea&s;on</HI> why a &s;in|ner does not embrace the go&s;pel, unregeneracy or the want of a principle of holine&s;s is <HI>no rea&s;on</HI>; and con|&s;equently regeneration (as di&s;tingui&s;hed from conver|&s;ion) removes <HI>no cau&s;e</HI> of impenitency. Again, the impleaded principle is palpably <HI>ab&s;urd.</HI> Oppo&s;ition of heart or will to the go&s;pel is refu&s;ing to embrace it, or rejecting it. But who can help <HI>feeling</HI> the ab|&s;urdity of &s;aying that,
<Q>the only rea&s;on why men re|fu&s;e to embrace the go&s;pel, is becau&s;e they refu&s;e to embrace it?</Q>
That is, this <HI>act of will</HI> either has no cau&s;e or rea&s;on of it's exi&s;tence, or el&s;e it is the cau&s;e or rea&s;on of it&s;elf. And this &s;hews the futility and impropriety of &s;uch kind of a&s;&s;ertions which &s;ome have been &s;o fond of, "The unregenerate can repent and turn to God if they will&mdash;There is nothing hin|ders but their own ob&s;tinate unwillingne&s;s, or want of will."

is a holy change of will: In one word, it is true repentance. The matter then comes to this, He that does repent, can repent! The important u&s;e of this &s;age maxim to reconcile the go&s;pel with common &s;en&s;e &s;eems to be a modern di&s;covery,
<Q>He that is wi&s;er for this may rejoice in it.</Q></P>
<P>I agree with our author that the inability of the un|regenerate is a &s;inful defect, nor have I the remote&s;t view or de&s;ire to weaken the foundation of this im|portant truth, but rather to confirm it. But I mu&s;t &s;ay, that Mr. H. with &s;undry others, how well &s;oever they may have de&s;erved of the chri&s;tian church on other accounts, have on this point (as I am verily per&s;uaded) darkned coun&s;el by words without know|ledge. To point out the impropriety of the&s;e new-fangled phra&s;es and notions, with which &s;ome are &s;o enamoured, with the fallacious rea&s;onings and con|clu&s;ions i&s;&s;uing from them, is an important &s;ervice to the cau&s;e of truth to which chri&s;tians &s;eem to be par|ticularly called at this day. If any man &s;peak let him &s;peak as the oracles of God.</P>
<P>The next point propo&s;ed to con&s;ideration, is now to be attended to, and may be &s;tated in the follow|ing manner.</P>
<P>Allowing that men have a power or principle, whereby they are capable of reforming their lives, and attending the means of grace, as has been de|clared and pleaded for; yet human nature is totally depraved. Are not natural principles then utterly &s;inful? And mu&s;t not all exerci&s;es of &s;uch principles be utterly &s;inful?</P>
<P>For the re&s;olution of this point let it be ob&s;erved, that we allow the depravity of human nature, yea the total depravity, as taught in &s;cripture, and in the re|formed churches, in oppo&s;ition to the pelagian and &s;emipelagian doctrine. We allow that all the princi|ples
<PB N="83" REF="012416_0087_0F89751DB021AF90">
of human nature in it's unrenewed &s;tate are cor|rupted by &s;in, that it is de&s;titute of a principle of true holine&s;s, and in a &s;tate of &s;priritual death. But we mu&s;t carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between natural principles con&s;idered &s;imply in them&s;elves, and the corruption of them. The corruption of human nature con&s;i&s;ts e&s;&s;entially and radically in a defect or privation of a principle of true holine&s;s, not in the infu&s;ion of any principles po&s;itively and in their own nature evil. Natural principles when &s;ub&s;i&s;ting and operating a|lone, un&s;ubordinate to a principle of holine&s;s, are cor|rupt, becau&s;e de&s;titute of a due perfection which they ought to have. Hence they are &s;ometimes called po&s;itive principles of &s;in; and indeed proper|ly enough, if we under&s;tand &s;in in the concrete &s;en&s;e: For every act of the &s;oul mu&s;t flow from &s;ome po&s;i|tive principle, though &s;infulne&s;s in the ab&s;tract flows only from a privative cau&s;e, as is commonly noted by divines. Thus &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is a corrupt principle, and a po&s;itive principle of &s;elfi&s;h actions; yet there is nothing properly po&s;itive in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s but the na|tural u&s;eful and innocent principle of lelf-love. Hu|man nature with it's principles may be con&s;idered &s;imply in it&s;elf, &s;o it is the work of God; and therefore not evil but good. It may al&s;o be con&s;idered as di|ve&s;ted by the &s;in of man of it's primitive moral per|fection, and thereby incapacitated to an&s;wer the great end of it's creation: So it is depraved and evil. But though depraved nature implies &s;omething po&s;itive, yet the depravity of nature con&s;i&s;ts properly not in any thing po&s;itive, but in a meer privation of it's due moral perfection.</P>
<P>That natural principles &s;o far as they denote any thing properly po&s;itive are not evil, may be demon|&s;trated various ways. God is the proper efficient cau&s;e of our nature, and of every thing po&s;itive be|longing
<PB N="84" REF="012416_0088_0F89751E715D3118">
to it: But he is not the efficient cau&s;e of evil, as all chri&s;tians not only allow but contend. Moreover, there is a real po&s;itive concurring influ|ence of almighty God with our natural principles in all their operations; but &s;urely it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine purity to excite and actuate any principle that is in it&s;elf e&s;&s;entially evil, &s;uppo&s;ing it were po&s;&s;i|ble (as it is not) that &s;uch a principle did really exi&s;t. The holy Spirit works upon the natural principles of the unregenerate altogether in awakening and hum|bling them, and exciting them to attend upon the means of grace; which would be directly in&s;tigating them to &s;in, as &s;in, if the&s;e principles and their ope|rations were in them&s;elves &s;imply evil. And finally if natural principles were po&s;itively evil, the opera|tions of divine grace would tend to de&s;troy them; but it is only the di&s;order introduced by &s;in that is removed in &s;anctification.</P>
<P>Though moral depravity has &s;pread over every part of human nature that is capable of it, yet not every thing in human nature is moral depravity. The di&s;tinction between <HI>natural principles</HI> and <HI>the corruption</HI> of them is of great importance; and it would be much better to endeavour to &s;et this in the plaine&s;t light po&s;&s;ible, than to heap up cloudy loo&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of total depravity, enmity, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and the like, as the manner of &s;ome has been, and then to draw &s;uch &s;trange conclu&s;ions as that all acts flowing from mere natural principles mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be acts of enmity again&s;t God, i. e. &s;ins of commi&s;&s;ion, po|&s;itively repugnant to the divine command. But i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we will conceive aright of this matter we may main|tain, that though natural principles, &s;eperate from and un&s;ubordinate to a principle of holine&s;s are depraved, yet in them&s;elves they are good lawful and u&s;eful. And though the want of a principle of holine&s;s de|prives
<PB N="85" REF="012416_0089_0F89752018953E50">
every act flowing from mere natural principles of that perfection which is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute it a holy action, which <HI>defect</HI> is contrary to the divine law, yet the want of a holy principle does not always and nece&s;&s;arily cau&s;e an act flowing from mere natural principles to be <HI>in it&s;elf</HI> contrary to the divine com|mand: And con&s;equently the &s;in adhering to it, <HI>does not con&s;i&s;t in what is done,</HI> but rather <HI>in the defect of &s;ome circum&s;tance</HI> which ought to have attended it: That is, it lies in omi&s;&s;ion rather than commi&s;&s;ion.

<P>But this matter mu&s;t be further opened and di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed, which I &s;hall endeavour to do as plainly as I can, by examining that famous que&s;tion, which has been &s;o long and &s;o much debated in the church, con|cerning the virtuous actions (as they are called) of the unregenerate. Whether, and in what &s;en&s;e they are &s;in? Whether and in what re&s;pect they are good? Here ob&s;erve, that the point to be enquired into is not, whether any actions of the unregenerate are ho|ly, either in a legal or evangelical acceptation? It is plain they are not. Nor whether they are not, taken in all their circum&s;tances &s;inful, and in this view may be termed &s;ins? This is granted. Nor whether they are meritorious of grace either in a way of condignity or congruity? This we do not pretend. And final|ly, we do not &s;uppo&s;e that there are any promi&s;es of &s;alvation, or regenerating grace to the doings of the unregenerate; but God acts with &s;overeign liberty in the exerci&s;es of his mercy. The que&s;tion then is, <HI>Are the be&s;t actions of the unregenerate properly denomi|nated good in any re&s;pect, and is there any moral goodne&s;s in them?</HI> By moral goodne&s;s is here meant
<PB N="86" REF="012416_0090_0F897520B9A10188">
any kind or degree of conformity to the law <HI>in any re&s;pect</HI>; though there &s;hould not be that intirene&s;s of conformity <HI>in all nece&s;&s;ary re&s;pects</HI> which is im|plied in true holine&s;s.</P>
<P>The full examination of this que&s;tion would carry us into the bowels of our main controver&s;y, which is re&s;erved for the &s;ubject of the two following &s;ections. But without anticipating I would ob&s;erve&mdash;</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, The be&s;t actions of the unrege|nerate are u&s;eful, both to them&s;elves and to mankind in general. They are often &s;ub&s;ervient, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, to their temporal and eternal good&mdash;and the neglect of them, with a contrary behaviour, is &s;inful, of pernicious tendency, and oftentimes of fatal con&s;equence.</P>
<P>And as the good works of believers which are &s;een of men are to the glory of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o are the ex|ternally good works of the unregenerate, when done in profe&s;&s;ed obedience to him. The inward princi|ple of holine&s;s is vi&s;ible only to the &s;earcher of hearts. The want of it therefore cannot hide the light &s;hining from a good conver&s;ation, in the &s;ight of mankind, by beholding of which they may be induced to glo|rify God. Therefore,</P>
<P>Secondly, There is a goodne&s;s in outward acts of religious obedience, &s;eperate from the goodne&s;s of the inward principle of action, or the immanent ex|erci&s;es of love to God and man. Actions externally good are by the acknowledgment of all, the proper exerci&s;es, and fit expre&s;&s;ions of a good heart. Now whatever act is a proper expre&s;&s;ion of a good heart, is in it&s;elf good ab&s;tract from the goodne&s;s of tem|per therein exerci&s;ed and expre&s;&s;ed; otherwi&s;e there would be no corre&s;pondence or an&s;werablene&s;s of the expre&s;&s;ion with the thing expre&s;&s;ed.

is in it&s;elf good and amiable, and therefore love prompts and di&s;po&s;es men to &s;uch a behaviour. A good man inclines to and takes complacency in a good behaviour. His goodne&s;s cau&s;es him to do &s;o. But if there were no goodne&s;s in the outward act of benefi|cence, except what con&s;i&s;ted in the inward exerci&s;e of love; then it would be perfectly indifferent whether love operated in this way, or in a conduct directly the rever&s;e. If good actions are not in them&s;elves better than bad ones, apart from the con&s;ideration of their principle; why &s;hould a good principle di&s;po&s;e a man to the one rather than the other? But if there be &s;uch a difference in the nature of human actions, that &s;ome are properly denominated good, and others evil in re&s;pect of their &s;ub&s;tance; which goodne&s;s or evil does not lie in their cau&s;es and principles; then there is a goodne&s;s in the be&s;t actions of the unrege|nerate, however de&s;titute they are of a principle of holine&s;s.</P>
<P>Thirdly, If the object of choice be good, as view|ed and cho&s;en by the mind; then the act of the will in chu&s;ing it is in it&s;elf good. The act of our will is indeed di&s;tinct from tho&s;e effects which flow from it by the laws of nature; &s;uch as the motion of our own or other bodies, in con&s;equence of the exertion of our &s;ouls. And it is po&s;&s;ible for a man by accident to do that which may prove of advantage to him&s;elf and others, when he acts with the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous intention. In this ca&s;e we &s;ay the action as cho&s;en and done by the agent is bad, though good has come of it contrary to his will. But when a good effect naturally flowing from the act of a man's will is fore|&s;een and cho&s;en as &s;uch; then the act of chu&s;ing is in it&s;elf good, as well as the object cho&s;en, or the ef|fect flowing from it. Nor is the matter at all effect|ed in a rational, and moral con&s;ideration, whether the
<PB N="88" REF="012416_0092_0F897522321E7990">
per&s;on were the immediate efficient cau&s;e of the good effect, or only an occa&s;ional one. Actions material|ly good are no doubt (if we &s;peak properly) the acti|ons of our &s;ouls, and not any external effects as de|tached from the agency of the will. The &s;ub&s;tance or matter of an act of choice is to be denominated good or evil, according to the nature of it's object, as viewed and cho&s;en by the mind. However de|fective the prime principles or ultimate ends of action may be, the choice of an action materially good is an act of choice materially good. And if there be any goodne&s;s in &s;ome external actions more than in others, which ought to incline a good man to take delight in them; then there is a goodne&s;s in the choice of &s;uch kind of actions: There is a goodne&s;s in the effective act of the will, &s;eperate from the goodne&s;s of the immanent act, or of the habit or principle from which the immanent act flows. If there be no goodne&s;s in effective acts of the will, except what con&s;i&s;ts in the goodne&s;s of the principles they flow from; then a principle of holine&s;s would no more fit di&s;po&s;e and prompt the &s;oul to &s;uch kind of acts than to the very rever&s;e. A &s;anctified heart which has a right judgment and ta&s;te approves of and inclines to &s;uch kind of acts: They are the proper exerci&s;es of a good principle; which is a clear evi|dence of their goodne&s;s in them&s;elves. Our choice of objects is not that which makes them good, but their goodne&s;s is the ground and rea&s;on of our chu|&s;ing them, as it is this which makes them fit objects of choice. As the <HI>effects</HI> flowing from an act of will are what they are in them&s;elves whether good or e|vil, whatever the de&s;ign of the agent might be, &s;o the <HI>effective acts</HI> them&s;elves are what they are in re|&s;pect of their &s;ub&s;tance, from whatever principles they might flow. In this &s;en&s;e it <HI>is a true</HI> principle,
<Q><PB N="89" REF="012416_0093_0F897522F081EC48">that the goodne&s;s or evil of actions lies in their nature and not in their cau&s;es.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards's Enquiry concerning the Will, part 4. &s;ect. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now when the unregenerate perform actions ma|terially good, the external effect, and the internal act of the mind chu&s;ing the action, and exerting effective power for the performance of it, are the &s;ame in their own nature, as if they acted from a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rinciple of true holine&s;s. And &s;ince &s;uch kind of actions are good in them&s;elves, ab&s;tract from the goodne&s;s of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> prin|ciple, the want of a holy principle does not deprive them of <HI>this kind of goodne&s;s</HI> whatever it may be.</P>
<P>But here it will naturally be enquired, what kind of goodne&s;s this is which belongs to external actions or effective acts as con&s;idered in them&s;elves, ab&s;tract from their principles? I an&s;wer fir&s;t, <HI>the u&s;efulne&s;s or good tendency of &s;uch actions:</HI> Their connection with and conducivene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to &s;uch ends as are ultimately good. Philo&s;ophers have di&s;tributed good into three kinds, <HI>bonum hone&s;tum, jucundum, &amp; utile.</HI> Moral good, happine&s;s, and that which is profitable, on ac|count of it's in&s;trumental &s;ub&s;erviency to the attain|ment of virtue or happine&s;s. The goodne&s;s of the end derives a goodne&s;s to the means conducing to it. In this &s;en&s;e at lea&s;t the be&s;t actions of the unregene|rate cannot be denied to be good, by any that allow them to be any ways conducive to their benefit. I add &s;econdly, If &s;uch actions are required in and by any divine command, if effective as well as immanent acts of the will are jointly and &s;everally &s;ubject to the law, then it mu&s;t be allowed that there is a moral goodne&s;s, in the &s;en&s;e before explained, in &s;uch acti|ons; that is, there is an agreement with the rule of duty, in the &s;ub&s;tance of the action, though &s;uch an imperfect kind of conformity as cannot be denomi|nated true holine&s;s. And yet it is &s;uch a kind of
<PB N="90" REF="012416_0094_0F897523B2245D60">
moral goodne&s;s, that the want of it is <HI>in it&s;elf</HI> really and e&s;&s;entially &s;in. This &s;uppo&s;ition is denied and exploded by Mr. H. and that (as his manner is) with high contempt of all that hold to it, as
<Q>per&s;ons who do not exerci&s;e their rea&s;on, but confu&s;e and bewilder them&s;elves with a &s;et of words without ideas.</Q>
We will in due time try the weight of his arguments; and &s;o leave it to the reader, when he &s;hall &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue of the controver&s;y in hand, to re|&s;olve this point for him&s;elf; which he will then, I hope, be able to do without any trouble.</P>
<P>All that I &s;hall add at pre&s;ent is a brief enquiry concerning the <HI>ends of unregenerate &s;inners in their be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> actions.</HI> Here, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, is the harde&s;t k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of all. For if it &s;hould be granted that natural prin|ciples of action are in them&s;elves good, or however not unlawful; and that &s;uch actions may flow from them as are materially good, that is u&s;eful, and an&s;wera|ble to the divine precept as to their &s;ub&s;tance, as has been declared; yet &s;urely it mu&s;t not be &s;aid that men are allowed, and much le&s;s required by God to do any action, however good in it&s;elf, for a bad end. Now it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the unregenerate always act for a wrong end; which &s;ince it is forbidden, their acting at all, while unregenerate &s;eems to be forbidden by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. Though the <HI>T&ograve; actum</HI> &s;hould be allowed to be good in &s;ome re&s;pects, yet the <HI>T&ograve; agere</HI> &s;eems in this ca&s;e to be evil and unlawful.</P>
<P>But it will require no very &s;trong finger to unty this knot, if what has been already laid down be re|membred, and nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinctions attended to.</P>
<P>The end of an action is that for the &s;ake of which the action is done. And this may be &s;aid to be ir|regular and wrong in two different re&s;pects. <HI>First,</HI> when what is &s;ought for is ab&s;olutely forbidden. In this ca&s;e we are not allowed to act at all in order to &s;uch
<PB N="91" REF="012416_0095_0F8975247012DAB0">
an end, even though the means in them&s;elves con|&s;idered may be lawful. Thus it was abominable in Jezebel to proclaim a fa&s;t, that under the cloke of zeal for reformation &s;he might murder Naboth. It was vile treachery in Judas to ki&s;s his Lord in order to betray him. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The end of an action is ir|regular and wrong when it is defective, though in it|&s;elf not ab&s;olutely forbidden. Here we mu&s;t carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between the end in it&s;elf, and the corrup|tion or irregularity of it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hen what a man &s;eeks for is good, his end is good in it&s;elf. But if he pur&s;ues this end <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n oppo&s;ition to a greater good, to which it ought to be &s;ubordinate, his end is wrong; not be|cau&s;e an object in it&s;elf forbidden is &s;ought, but be|cau&s;e a greater good is neglected. To do a forbidden action, or aim at a forbidden end is always unlawful. So it is to neglect a commanded action, or not to di|rect our actions to the glory of God, which ought to be our governing end: But it is not unlawful in it|&s;elf to do an action materially good for an inferior end, if the pur&s;uit of &s;uch an end be not forbidden end.</P>
<P>When men act in order to obtain a forbidden end, we grant that their acting at all in this ca&s;e is directly repugnant to the command of God. The choice of &s;uch an end is in it&s;elf po&s;itively oppo&s;ite to the di|vine will: It is a &s;in of commi&s;&s;ion: It is an act materially evil; and is in no ca&s;e commanded allow|ed or encouraged by God. Thus if a man &s;hould utter the words of a prayer, with a malicious intent to mock God, and profane his ordinances; &s;uch an act|ion would be in it&s;elf horribly wicked. To act at all with &s;uch a de&s;ign would be an exerci&s;e of con|tempt and enmity again&s;t God.</P>
<P>But the unregenerate do not always act for &s;uch ends as are in them&s;elves forbidden, and unlawful, though the ends of their actions are always e&s;&s;entially
<PB N="92" REF="012416_0096_0F8975252FA9ACE8">
defective. For a man to &s;trive to e&s;cape mi&s;ery is to act for a rea&s;onable and lawful end; unle&s;s it be a duty to de&s;ire mi&s;ery, or at lea&s;t to be unconcerned a|bout it. It a man has no other aim or de&s;ire than to &s;ecure his own happine&s;s, his end is defective and irregular. But the fault does not lie in his &s;eeking a forbidden object, but in neglecting and refu&s;ing to aim at the glory o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God therein. To de&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and &s;eek our own happine&s;s is not directly and po&s;itively re|pugnant to the divine command: It is no &s;in of com|mi&s;&s;ion: It is not materially evil. When we &s;eek our own happine&s;s un&s;ubordinate to the glory of God, our end is indeed irregular and incon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le to the di|vine command. This irregularity lies in the privation of a &s;upreme regard to God. Un&s;ubordinatene&s;s is a relative denomination, importing only the defect of a &s;uperior governing principle and end. The want of a pious regard to God is a &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of omi&s;&s;ion. The actu|al and po&s;itive rejection of God and his honor, when propo&s;ed as the ultimate end of our action is a &s;in of commi&s;&s;ion, and may be termed an exerci&s;e of enmity again&s;t him. But a di&s;regard to God, and for&s;aking him are in their own nature intirely di&s;tinct from a regard to our own happine&s;s, and an endeavour to &s;ecure and promote it.</P>
<P>There is evidently, in the judgment of common &s;en&s;e, a broad difference, between acting for an un|lawful end, and acting for an end lawful in it&s;elf, though un&s;ubordinate to a higher one. If a man gives money to his poor neighbour to hire him to murder his enemy, he is him&s;elf a murderer. If he does it in hopes of a temporal reward, it does not ap|pear that the action or end is in it&s;elf unlawful, though both are &s;infully defective if he aims at nothing higher. In the former ca&s;e the action is an exerci&s;e of enmity; in the latter it is an exerci&s;e of mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;elf-love. By
<PB N="93" REF="012416_0097_0F897526C969F538">
refraining to act for an unlawful end, we refrain from &s;in; but no &s;in is avoided by forbearing to act for a &s;ubordinate lawful end. If it were po&s;&s;ible for a man to dive&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him&s;elf intirely of &s;elf-love, or &s;u&s;pend all it's exerci&s;es; the want of love to God, or aver&s;ion of heart from him would be as vicious, as if the man was &s;eeking his own happine&s;s un&s;ubordinate to the divine glory.</P>
<P>It is as I conceive through inattention to the di&s;t|inctions above propo&s;ed, between natural principles and the corruption of them, between forbidden and defective ends, that Mr. H. has been deceived in his rea&s;onings and conclu&s;ions. He &s;uppo&s;es that all exerci&s;es of the unregenerate are acts of enmity again&s;t God, becau&s;e they are carnally minded, and the car|nal mind is enmity again&s;t God. And before acts of enmity are forever unlawful. The unavoidable con&s;equence of which is that it is utterly unlawful for men to act at all from natural principles. But this is mere fallacy. Actions may flow from princi|ples that are corrupt, and yet not flow from their corruption, &s;o not be any <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> or <HI>expre&s;&s;ion</HI> of moral corruption. A man acting merely from &s;elf-love may do actions which are not &s;elfi&s;h but intere&s;t|ed. An action is not &s;elfi&s;h, or an exerci&s;e of &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s, unle&s;s a di&s;regard of the good of others, as well as &s;elf love, has an influence into it as <HI>a formal prin|ciple,</HI> and is therein expre&s;&s;ed; which is never the ca&s;e unle&s;s &s;elf-intere&s;t is &s;uppo&s;ed to interfere with the intere&s;t of others. An action is not an exerci&s;e of moral depravity, unle&s;s moral depravity be the cau&s;e of a man's doing it; &s;o that his conduct would have been the rever&s;e if he had not been morally de|praved. An action is not an exerci&s;e of enmity a|gain&s;t God, unle&s;s enmity to God be the cau&s;e and formal principle of it; &s;o that it would not have
<PB N="94" REF="012416_0098_0F897527CCD8C5C8">
been done unle&s;s the agent had hated God. Now it is plain there are many actions flowing from natural principles, and directed to interior ends, which being un&s;ubordinate to a holy principle and end, are there|fore privatively corrupt; which actions, though de|&s;titute of that conformity to the divine law in re&s;pect of principle and end which is implied in true holi|ne&s;s, do not take their form from the corruption of their principle or end, but from that in or belonging thereto, which is lawful and good: And con&s;equent|ly, whatever &s;infulne&s;s adheres to &s;uch action, lies in the <HI>omi&s;&s;ion</HI> of &s;ome requi&s;ite qualification, and not in any <HI>actual</HI> and <HI>po&s;itive repugnancy</HI> of the <HI>act it&s;elf</HI> to the divine law. This omi&s;&s;ion indeed may be &s;aid, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, to flow from the corruption of human nature; but the act it&s;elf does not, nor is any exerci&s;e or expre&s;&s;ion of it. What I mean may be better under&s;tood perhaps when illu&s;trated by a fa|miliar &s;imilitude. A young child who has not wi&s;|dom to judge what is good for him&s;elf, may to gratify his appetite eat what is unwhole&s;ome; and he may to gratify his appetite eat what is whole&s;ome as well as plea&s;ant. In both ca&s;es he acts without wi&s;dom, following his appetite. But when he eats what is unwhole&s;ome, his want of wi&s;dom is, though not a phy&s;ical, yet a proper logical cau&s;e of his action; be|cau&s;e notwith&s;tanding his appetite if he had been wi&s;e he would not have done it. And therefore his fool|i&s;hne&s;s in conjunction with his natural appetite is the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al principle of his action; which action <HI>takes it's form from,</HI> and is an <HI>effect</HI> or <HI>expre&s;&s;ion</HI> of folly as well as natural appetite. His natural appetite is the proper po&s;itive principle of the <HI>action</HI>; his want of wi&s;dom is the proper privative cau&s;e of the <HI>fooli&s;h|ne&s;s</HI> of it. But when a child to gratify his appetite eats what is both plea&s;ant and whole&s;ome, though he
<PB N="95" REF="012416_0099_0F89752832097A90">
acts without wi&s;dom, yet want of wi&s;dom is not the formal principle of his action; it is not a cau&s;e or rea&s;on in any &s;en&s;e of his doing what he does. His action is no exerci&s;e or expre&s;&s;ion of folly, but merely of natural appetite. Though he acts from mere ap|petite, his action is agreable to the rules of wi&s;dom. If he knew what was good for him&s;elf he would do the very &s;ame. In this ca&s;e neither wi&s;dom nor folly, but natural appetite is the <HI>logical, phy&s;ical, formal</HI> principle of his action.</P>
<P>Thus when a man in order to promote his &s;uppo|&s;ed intere&s;t acts in oppo&s;ition to the rules of piety and humanity, the want of a due regard to God and his neighbour is in conjunction with &s;elf-love, the lo|gical cau&s;e and formal principle of his conduct; which therefore is an exerci&s;e and expre&s;&s;ion of moral de|pravity, as well as natural &s;elf-love. But when a &s;inner does any action materially good from mere &s;elf-love, in hopes that it will be to his advantage; in this ca&s;e the action does not flow, or take it's form, from the corruption of human nature. It does not flow from enmity again&s;t God and his neighbour, nor from want of love, nor from want of an habitual principle di&s;po&s;ing to exerci&s;es of love; but from that natural lawful and u&s;eful principle, implanted within us by God, whereby we incline to our own happine&s;s. The end here aimed at is not &s;uppo&s;ed to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the good of the univer&s;e: His de&s;ign is not to hurt others, but to advantage him&s;elf. Such an action can with no propriety be called an exerci&s;e of enmity to God or man; becau&s;e however aver&s;e the heart of the &s;inner may be from God and man at the time of acting; yet it is not enmity, but mere &s;elf-love that di&s;po&s;es and determines him to &s;uch a conduct. A change of heart would no other|wi&s;e change the actings of his will in this ca&s;e, than
<PB N="96" REF="012416_0100_0F8973E13480C7D8">
by joining the influence of a new governing princi|ple with tho&s;e natural principles which operated be|fore.

<P>Man in his depraved &s;tate is an enemy to God. He is fallen under the dominion of &s;in. The prin|ciples and exerci&s;es of his heart <HI>are not &s;ubject to the law of God, nor indeed can be,</HI> &s;o long as he is <HI>in</HI> and <HI>after the fle&s;h,</HI> as the apo&s;tle &s;peaks; that is, &s;o long as he is unregenerate. His heart is alienated from God and his holy law: All his actions are inconfor|mable to the rule of duty. This alienation of heart from God, with that actual di&s;obedience which flows from it, being in it&s;elf and in it's natural tendency di&s;honorary to God, is termed <HI>con&s;tructive</HI> enmity to God, which is implied in all &s;in; which yet is to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from that <HI>actual</HI> and <HI>direct</HI> ri&s;ing of the heart again&s;t the divine maje&s;ty which is u&s;ually term|ed <HI>hatred of God.

<P>Some have &s;eemed to think that natural affections (&s;elf-love for in&s;tance) when un&s;ubordinate to general benevolence, are <HI>in them&s;elves</HI> acts of oppo&s;ition, or enmity to being in general. For &s;uch an affection (it is &s;aid) exalts it's private object above the other great and infinite object; it puts down being in general which is infinitely &s;uperior into an inferior place. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Edwards on the Nature of true Virtue, pag. 131,</NOTE>

But this is argued rather like a rhetorician than a phi|lo&s;opher. It is not &s;elf-love that puts down being in general, but it is the privation of general benevolence. It is not any private affection in it&s;elf, but it's un&s;ub|ordinatene&s;s to the love of God and our fellow crea|tures that is vicious. This un&s;ubordinatene&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t in the nature or &s;trength of the affection, but is only the privation of a &s;uperior principle; that is, it is only the want of a &s;upreme regard to God. It does not appear that &s;elf-love is &s;tronger in &s;elfi&s;h per&s;ons than in others; at lea&s;t there is no need of &s;uppo&s;ing that it is in order to account for their conduct. The want of good will to others will &s;et up &s;elf intere&s;t; or leave it to be the highe&s;t ob|ject of the affections. And indeed this is all in a &s;elfi&s;h temper or affection that is in it&s;elf vicious. No action is the wor&s;e for being intere&s;ted, or the better for being di&s;intere&s;ted. Di&s;intere&s;ted mi&s;chievou&s;ne&s;s imports the utmo&s;t wickedne&s;s. And it was no ways derogatory to the perfection of our Savior's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God in his &s;ufferings, that he endured the cro&s;s for the joy that was &s;et before him.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, though the be&s;t actions of the unregenerate are not &s;piritually good, becau&s;e e&s;&s;en|tially defective; yet they may be materially good; they may flow from principles, and be directed to ends good in them&s;elves, though of an inferior kind. Nor is this anything more than has been a&s;&s;er|ted by the mo&s;t eminent lights of the chri&s;tian church ancient and modern, as might ea&s;ily be &s;hewn. And therefore I cannot but wonder how Mr. H. &s;hould a&s;&s;ert confidently in the face of the public, that

<HEAD>SECT. III. Arguments proving that &s;omething is re|quired of Men in a way of Duty previous and preparatory to Regeneration.</HEAD>
<P>TO open our way more plainly to the en&s;uing arguments, I would premi&s;e one di&s;tinction, which the reader will find nece&s;&s;ary to be at|tended to and carried in mind, that he may the bet|ter apprehend the force and pertinency of what is to be offered, and remove &s;uch objections as may occur: And that is the di&s;tinction between the <HI>moral law &s;imply con&s;idered,</HI> and the <HI>divine precepts as contained in &s;cripture, and enjoined on men by &s;upernatural re|velation.</HI></P>
<P>The natural and &s;upernatural law (if we may thus di&s;tingui&s;h them) do agree in the general notion, or formal e&s;&s;ence of law; that is a rule and bond of duty with annexed &s;anctions. They agree al&s;o in their author, viz. God the &s;upreme lawgiver. They al&s;o coincide in their requirements, &s;o as mutually to &s;trengthen each other. For the law of nature binds us to obey all &s;upernatural di&s;coveries of the divine will, as &s;oon as they are made known to us; it being an eternal principle of the law of nature that all &s;u|pernatural revelations of the will of God (if any &s;uch there be) ought to be obeyed. And the &s;upernatu|ral law of revelation e&s;tabli&s;hes the law of nature, not only as it always &s;uppo&s;es it's unchangeable ob|ligation,
<PB N="101" REF="012416_0105_0F8973E4F24654B0">
but requires the &s;ame moral duties to which we are by the law of nature nece&s;&s;arily bound, and lays us under &s;ome additional obligations of obedi|ence. The difference then here to be noted con&s;i&s;ts e&s;pecially in the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. The moral law &s;trictly and &s;imply con&s;idered flows nece&s;&s;arily from the nature of God and man, and the relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them; but the commands of God enjoined by &s;upernatural reve|lation, flow freely from his &s;overeign will. Though the creation of moral agents be a free &s;overeign act of the divine will, yet when once they are created their obligation to love and obey God re&s;ults nece&s;&s;arily from the perfections and bounty of the creator, and the dependence of the creature on him for being and happine&s;s. The moral law is therefore of nece&s;&s;ary and unchangeable obligation. But &s;uch commands as are given by &s;upernatural revelation are, as &s;uch, formally acts of divine &s;overeignty. The giving any &s;uch commands to mankind, was a free &s;overeign act of God's will. And it was the &s;ame &s;overeign will of God, that, according to the coun&s;els of infinite wi&s;dom, determined what precepts were to be con|tained in this &s;upernatural law. Even th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e moral duties which are of eternal obligation, as well as tho&s;e duties which are called po&s;itive, and are in their own nature changeable, have a place in this &s;upernatural law, only becau&s;e the &s;overeign will and authority of the great legi&s;lator was plea&s;ed &s;o to ordain; and not from any nece&s;&s;ity in the nature of things. Though a duty of nece&s;&s;ary obligation cannot be cancelled by any act of the divine will, and therefore we are ne|ce&s;&s;arily bound by the moral law; yet this infers no nece&s;&s;ity that a &s;upernatural revelation of God's will &s;hould take in every duty of the moral law. That additional inforcement of obedience, which re&s;ults
<PB N="102" REF="012416_0106_0F8973E5B2E870B0">
from a &s;upernatural injunction, or po&s;itive act of &s;ove|reign authority, may be &s;uperadded to all, or to &s;ome only of the duties of the moral law, as infinite wi&s;|dom &s;hall &s;ee fit, and the ends for which &s;uch a re|velation is given may require.</P>
<P N="2">2. The moral law binds all moral agents; but the precepts of &s;upernatural revelation bind tho&s;e only to whom the revelation is given. The precepts of revelation, as &s;uch, belong only to fallen man. Yea &s;uch of mankind as are invincibly ignorant of di|vine revelation, are not bound to obey any of it's precepts <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> though they may be bound to the &s;ame duties for &s;ub&s;tance, as contained in the moral law of nature. The &s;cripture revelation being de|&s;igned for and given to fallen man alone, he only is &s;ubject to it's injunctions. Therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;upernatural law is founded on the di&s;pen|&s;ation of grace through the mediator; but the law of nature has no nece&s;&s;ary dependence on that di&s;pen|&s;ation. The duties required of men in the go&s;pel, are required for &s;uch ends as could not have taken place, unle&s;s an act of grace had pa&s;&s;ed in favor of fallen man. This I have el&s;ewhere proved, nor is it that I know of denied by any. And I may add, that the duties are many of them &s;uch in their nature, that there could have been no po&s;&s;ible place f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r them, unle&s;s in con&s;equence of the di&s;pen&s;ation of grace.</P>
<P N="4">4. The moral law &s;imply con&s;idered requires obe|dience, merely becau&s;e it is right and ju&s;tly due. It exacts duties &s;olely as a debt in which we are bound to God, and not as means of future advantage, or conditions of future rewards. The law gives no re|ward beyond the condign merit of a creature, which is perfectly nothing. Whatever benefit or reward may accrue to a creature in the way of obedience is owing to divine bounty, or a free promi&s;e, intirely
<PB N="103" REF="012416_0107_0F8973E6762E1248">
di&s;tinct from mere law; nor does the obligation of the law depend at all upon it. But the precepts of revelation require duties not only as debts of obedi|ence, but al&s;o as means in order to &s;ome further ends. Even tho&s;e duties which are required by the moral law, and &s;o are of nece&s;&s;ary obligation, have by the gracious appointment of God an in&s;trumental &s;ub&s;er|viency to the benefit of mankind, in this and the com|ing world, and <HI>as &s;uch</HI> are enjoined in the &s;criptures. By being taken into this &s;upernatural law, and ap|pointed as means of our pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s, <HI>moral precepts</HI> have a new and di&s;tinct obligation and enforcement &s;uperadded to them by the &s;overeign will of God; and we have a new additional rea&s;on for o|beying them. And as to <HI>po&s;itive precepts,</HI> our obli|gation to the ob&s;ervance of them is wholly to be re|&s;olved into God's &s;overeign will, and their &s;ub&s;ervien|cy as means to &s;ome good end, di&s;tinct from the per|formance therein required.</P>
<P>Corollary, If duties be required in the &s;cripture as means in order to &s;ome further end, by the &s;overeign appointment of God, and it hence be concluded that &s;uch a performance of them as is fitted to &s;ub&s;erve the end propo&s;ed is contained in the requirement, and of con&s;equence is a commanded duty, how far &s;hort &s;oever it may fall of that perfection of obedience, which the law requires, this conclu&s;ion will not imply any relaxation of the obligation men are under to yield perfect obedience to the moral law, or extenu|ate the guilt of any failure in the lea&s;t degree. But of this afterwards.</P>
<P>The attentive reader, I tru&s;t, cannot but perceive from the&s;e ob&s;ervations, what will more plainly ap|pear in our progre&s;s, that is, the fitne&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;tingui&s;hing between the moral law con&s;idered &s;imply and &s;trictly in it&s;elf, as a rule and bond of
<PB N="104" REF="012416_0108_0F8973E732E35FD0">
right action to moral agents in general; and the di|vine precepts given by &s;upernatural revelation, to fal|len man alone, upon the foundation of divine grace through the mediator, pre&s;cribing duties as means of carrying into execution God's merciful purpo&s;es to|wards the children of men. This being premi&s;ed, I &s;hall now addre&s;s my&s;elf to the proof of my po&s;ition, as above &s;tated and explained.</P>
<P N="1">I. The principles laid down in the preceeding &s;ection unavoidably lead us to conclude, that &s;ome|thing is required of men in a way of duty, which they are able to do previous to regeneration.</P>
<P>It has been proved that the unregenerate who en|joy go&s;pel privileges are able, by the common a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of divine providence and grace, to reform their lives; to break off from cour&s;es and acts of open &s;in in oppo&s;ition to the dictates of their own con&s;cience; to do actions materially good, and that &s;eriou&s;ly and con&s;cientiou&s;ly according to their pre&s;ent light. They have both faculties and principles of action &s;ufficient for the&s;e things. If the&s;e things are enjoined upon them by, and contained in tho&s;e commands which God in his word has laid upon them, then it is their duty thus to reform their lives, and attend the means of grace, that is, &s;omething is their duty which they have a power to do before regeneration. The con|&s;equence cannot be denied, unle&s;s we will deny that it is the duty of men to do whatever God has enjoin|ed on them.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e things abovementioned, which men have a power to do while unregenerate, are contain|ed in and enjoined by tho&s;e commands which God in his word has laid upon them. For it has been &s;hewn, and is abundantly evident from &s;cripture, that the divine command requires not only right princi|ples and ends of action, but al&s;o that the action it&s;elf
<PB N="105" REF="012416_0109_0F8973E7F09A6DB8">
be materially good. It regulates the performances as well as the affections; the external and imperate, as well as the immanent or elicit acts of the will. It enjoins the work it&s;elf, as well as tho&s;e circum&s;tances which are requi&s;ite to con&s;titute it a holy action. Mr. H. owns, that if there be any commands en|joining a reformation of life and a good behaviour on the regenerate, then the &s;ame is enjoined on the un|regenerate. For he &s;ays (p. 116.)
<Q>No duty is re|quired of the regenerate which the unregenerate are not al&s;o commanded to do.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is not true. It is doubtle&s;s the duty of the regenerate to thank God for his di&s;tingui&s;hing mercy in their election, rege|neration, conver&s;ion, ju&s;tification, &amp;c; which cannot be the pre&s;ent duty of any unregenerate &s;inner.</NOTE> The unrege|nerate then are commanded to reform their lives; to hear, read, and meditate on the word of God; to examine their hearts and ways, and pray to God for pardoning mercy through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. That is, they are commanded to do tho&s;e actions, which they have both faculties and principles &s;ufficient to enable them to do, as to the &s;ub&s;tance of the performance.</P>
<P>If then the command requires <HI>&s;uch actions,</HI> as well as &s;uch circum&s;tances, principles, and manner of act|ing, as are implied in true holine&s;s; then the &s;ub|&s;tance of the actions, though de&s;titute of the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances. are matter of duty, as being a part, though not the whole of the requirement. The command obliges to the whole of our duty, and to each di&s;tinct part of it. Such effective acts of the will as are required, are materially good; they have a goodne&s;s di&s;tinct from, and not dependent on all tho&s;e circum&s;tances and qualifications, which are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute them holy actions. And there is an obligation to the performance of them, <HI>be&s;ides</HI> the obligation to perform them in a right manner in
<PB N="106" REF="012416_0110_0F8973E981A8B690">
every re&s;pect; and con&s;equently, there is an obliga|tion to the doing of that which men are able to do before regeneration.</P>
<P>Actions may be taken in a twofold &s;en&s;e, that is, as learned writers expre&s;s it, <HI>in &s;en&s;u compo&s;ito &amp; in &s;en&s;u divi&s;o.</HI> The meaning is, they may be taken as comprehending, and inve&s;ted with, all their moral circum&s;tances, qualifications, and adjuncts; or they may be taken &s;imply and ab&s;tractly in them&s;elves. In the latter &s;en&s;e, no imperate act of the will can be denominated holy, though for &s;ub&s;tance conformable to the divine command; becau&s;e holine&s;s implies a conformity to the will of God in the circum&s;tances and qualifications, as well as the &s;ub&s;tance of the action; as has been before declared. Yet the actions of men are &s;ubject to the divine command in the lat|ter as well as the former &s;en&s;e; that is, the divine command enjoins the whole of what is contained in a holy action <HI>conjunctly,</HI> and it enjoins each ingredient of the action in this compound &s;en&s;e, <HI>&s;everally.</HI> We are commanded to do actions materially good; we are al&s;o commanded to do them in &s;uch a manner, and with &s;uch a degree of &s;trength, as is perfectly conformable to the rule of our duty. But the&s;e things are &s;o commanded, that however we may fail in &s;ome particulars, we are neverthele&s;s bound to the ob&s;erv|ance of all and each of the other. Which may be thus proved. The guilt of any &s;inful action is more or le&s;s multiplied or aggravated, as it is inconforma|ble to the divine law in more or fewer re&s;pects. If an action be an&s;werable to the law in matter and manner, but &s;omewhat deficient in the degree or &s;trength of the performance, it's &s;infulne&s;s is not &s;o great, as if it were deficient in a greater degree: It would be yet more &s;inful if not done for a holy end; and &s;till more if done for an unlawful or forbidden
<PB N="107" REF="012416_0111_0F8973EA95089138">
end; and finally it's guilt would be yet greater if the action it&s;elf, as well as it's end and circum&s;tances were unlawful.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To omit the duty (external ob&s;ervances of religion) wholly, is wor&s;e than to perform good in a wrong manner, and to be doing evil in&s;tead of both is yet much wor&s;e. Goodwin's Works, Vol. 3 pag. 430.</NOTE> It is not &s;o bad for a man to ex|erci&s;e a covetous principle, by &s;triving to acquire riches in a lawful way that he may lay up trea&s;ures on earth, (though this is utterly forbidden) as it would be to &s;eek riches for the &s;ame purpo&s;e by &s;tealing, robbery, and all manner of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. If there were not an obligation to the performance of the action in it&s;elf con&s;idered, as well as taken in con|junction with all it's moral circum&s;tances; then the omi&s;&s;ion of it would not in it&s;elf be &s;in, nor could it add any thing to the guilt ari&s;ing from the irregula|rity of &s;uch circum&s;tances. For &s;in is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law. We may be &s;ure that that is in it&s;elf a duty, the omi&s;&s;ion of which is in it&s;elf &s;in. Now though external duties <HI>in &s;en&s;u divi&s;o</HI> be not holine&s;s, yet the omi&s;&s;ion of them is in it&s;elf &s;in: And con&s;e|quently external duties are required in and by the di|vine law. We are &s;o bound by the law of God that an uninterrupted cour&s;e of obedience is our duty; and each particular act taken by it&s;elf is al&s;o our duty; and in each act of obedience, perfection in degree, ac|cording to the &s;trength of our faculties is our duty; and &s;o is every inferior degree that can be &s;uppo&s;ed: And finally whatever is contained in the e&s;&s;ence of true holine&s;s collectively con&s;idered is our duty; and at the &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e time each particular ingredient, circum|&s;tance or qualification, is al&s;o our duty, taken &s;epa|rately and by it&s;elf. And our guilt is multiplied and enhanced according as we have violated more of the&s;e obligations, and broken the divine command in more re&s;pects.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="012416_0112_0F8973EAF21F38F8">To &s;um up the argument. Since actions materi|ally good, con&s;idered in them&s;elves, are required of men as matter of duty; and, &s;ince unregenerate &s;in|ners have a power to do actions materially good; we conclude, that unregenerate &s;inners have a power to do &s;omething which is required as matter of duty: Which is the point we undertook to maintain.</P>
<P>Mr. H. has moved an objection which contains the &s;ub&s;tance of the argument above propo&s;ed, viz.
<Q>That men by doing actions materially good, do &s;ome part of their duty, and &s;o far obey the com|mand.</Q>

<P>An&s;w. We may here note that this a&s;&s;ertion,
<Q>that nothing is either &s;in or duty, if con&s;idered as not implying any exerci&s;es of the heart,</Q>
is a plain de|nial of the doctrines of original &s;in and righteou&s;ne&s;s, or of &s;infulne&s;s or righteou&s;ne&s;s of nature di&s;tinct from, and previous to all acts of the mind. But this I &s;uppo&s;e was owing to inadvertence, and therefore I &s;hall take no further notice of it. There are al&s;o &s;ome &s;ins of omi&s;&s;ion which do not imply any exer|ci&s;es of heart.

<P>All actions whether taken in the compound, or di|vided &s;en&s;e are acts of the will The &s;ub&s;tance of an action, is the action it&s;elf ab&s;tracted from it's circum|&s;tances. External actions are acts of the will <HI>ad ex|tra.</HI> Involuntary motion and effects are not the &s;ub&s;tance and matter of action. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or are the natural effects and con&s;equences of our voluntary exertions, though apprehended and cho&s;en by us, the &s;ub&s;tance of

our action of properly &s;peaking. This is no other than the very act of our will, chu&s;ing that tho&s;e effects &s;hould take place, and putting forth our executive power for the production of them. Mr. H. &s;trange|ly &s;uppo&s;es that by the &s;ub&s;tance and matter of a du|ty or action is meant &s;omething di&s;tinct from all ex|erci&s;es of the heart, or acts of the will; &s;omething of which a meer machine is capable; and then concludes, (as well he might) that there is no &s;in or duty in all this, in it&s;elf con&s;idered; adding &s;ome contemptuous expre&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e who are other|wi&s;e minded, as per&s;ons, who bewilder them&s;elves wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h a &s;et of words without meaning. We leave them to his correction if there be any &s;o ab&s;urd as to hold that to be the matter of an action which is no act of the will. But what is this to the purpo&s;e of an&s;wering our argument, which &s;uppo&s;es the duties in que&s;tion to be voluntary actions? Methinks &s;ome|body el&s;e is got bewildered, be&s;ides tho&s;e men of &s;traw which our author attacks with &s;o much &s;pirit.</P>
<P>It is further pleaded, &s;uppo&s;ing the actions in que&s;tion be voluntary, yet it is rather more ab&s;urd
<Q>to &s;peak of a man's doing any part of his duty in his external conduct, when his conduct is con&s;idered as the fruit of wrong and &s;inful exerci&s;es of heart.</Q>
Pag. 118.</P>
<P>An&s;w. 1. We do not &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>fruit</HI> of any exerci&s;es of the heart, or acts of the will, whether right or wrong, is the matter of duty, unle&s;s <HI>that fruit</HI> be al&s;o an act of the will, Now there is no ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing, that an act of the will may in it&s;elf be good, and the matter of a commanded duty, though it be the fruit of a preceding act which was not &s;o. Mr. Edwards be&s;ure, did not think there was a gro&s;s ab|&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing that the goodne&s;s or evil of actions lay in their nature and not in their cau&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry concerning the Will, part iv. &s;ect. 1.</NOTE>

Giving alms is a good action in it&s;elf, and the matter of duty; though, in the Phari&s;ees it was the fruit of pride, which be&s;ure was no good principle. If the object cho&s;en be good, the act of chu&s;ing is materially good, however it may be wrong in it's adjuncts and circum&s;tances. It is good <HI>in &s;en&s;u divi&s;o.</HI> It is wrong <HI>in &s;en&s;u compo&s;ito.</HI> An act of choice in it&s;elf is either good or evil according to the nature of it's object. Since then we are divinely commanded to do actions materially good, we conclude that it is our duty to do them.</P>
<P>It will be enquired, is it then our duty to do the&s;e things from wrong principles, and for unlawful ends?</P>
<P>An&s;w. 1. It is not our duty to be actuated by e|vil principles, or aim at unlawful ends, in any of our actions. This is utterly &s;inful. But the doing a com|manded action is in it&s;elf a duty, how much &s;oever we may fail in the principle, end and manner of the performance. And our guilt will be double, if the action as well as it's principle and end be utterly wrong.</P>
<P N="2">2. The principles and ends of mens actions may be &s;aid to be wrong in two &s;en&s;es. 1. When they are in them&s;elves ab&s;olutely forbidden, as when a man acts from malice. To act at all with a mi&s;chievous intent is unlawful. In this ca&s;e the formal principle, and final cau&s;e of the action is in it&s;elf &s;in. The action not only flows from a heart that is corrupt, but from the corruption it&s;elf. 2. The principles and ends of mens actions are &s;aid to be wrong, when they are defective; though in them&s;elves good in their kind. Such are the principles of &s;elf-love, natural con&s;cience, &amp;c. in the unregenerate. Now when men do actions materially good from the&s;e prin|ciples, they do not act from &s;inful principles as &s;inful. That is, though they are defectively corrupt, the
<PB N="111" REF="012416_0115_0F8973ED33D33E10">
action does not flow and take it's form from their corruption, as was noted in the la&s;t &s;ection. This is well expre&s;&s;ed by Dr. Pre&s;ton, "Take man's nature," &s;ays he,
<Q>as &s;ecluded from [&s;anctifying] grace, it is able to do two things; to bring forth &s;in and lu&s;t, which comes from the corruption of it, and like|wi&s;e many excellent virtues, which proceed from common nature which is in a man unregenerate, as well as &s;inful nature.</Q>

<P>It is further argued by Mr. H. that what are call|ed external duties
<Q>are not required for their own &s;akes, or in them&s;elves con&s;idered, but only as proper ways of exerci&s;ing and expre&s;&s;ing love to God. Love to God is therefore the thing required: The whole of the duty lies in this: And where this is wanting the externals are as to duty an empty nothing, not the thing required; and in doing them no duty is done.</Q>
Pag. 118, 119.</P>
<P>Here are two propo&s;itions, of which the latter (ac|cording to Mr. H.) follows from the former, being connected with it by the illative particle [therefore.] We will fir&s;t con&s;ider their connection, and then ex|amine the truth of each of them apart.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="012416_0116_0F8973EDF23AF688">As to their connection: Our author here argues, that
<Q>if external duties are not required for their own &s;akes, but only as proper ways of exerci&s;ing and expre&s;&s;|ing love to God; then love to God is the [only] thing required: The whole du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y lies in this.</Q>
But how can this con&s;equence flow from the antecedent to which it is &s;ubjoined? Or indeed how can it con&s;i&s;t with it? Common &s;en&s;e I &s;hould imagine, would conclude that if external duties are required at all, whether for their own &s;akes, or on any other account; then love to God is not the only thing required, nor does the duty lie wholly in this. Certain it is, that external actions are as diver&s;e from love, as the effect is from it's cau&s;e, as the &s;ign is from the thing &s;ignified; as an immanent affection is from an exer|tion of operative power for the performance of an outward work. On the contrary, if love be the only thing required, no imperate act of the will is required at all. If the whole duty lies in love, no part of it lies in expre&s;&s;ing love, or in exerting any effective acts from any principle whatever. All the fruits and effects of love i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a way of endeavour to glorify God, and do good to men, being in nature intirely diver&s;e from the affection of love, mu&s;t be cancelled from the li&s;t of duties, as well as the endeavours of the unregenerate. To draw a con&s;equence from a principle incon&s;i&s;tent with and contrary to it, is me|thinks a little extraordinary. But,</P>
<P>Let us now examine the truth of each propo&s;ition apart. To begin with the latter, viz. That in ex|ternal duties of religion love to God is the only thing required, the whole duty lies in this. This mu&s;t be denied, &s;ince not only &s;cripture and rea&s;on, but Mr. H. him&s;elf will &s;upport us in &s;aying, that endeavours of external obedience are required, as well as the af|fection of love, at lea&s;t when they accompany and
<PB N="113" REF="012416_0117_0F8973EEB0EECB60">
flow from love to God, and are genuine fruits exer|ci&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions of it. I add, that &s;ince the o|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch endeavours is <HI>&s;in in it&s;elf,</HI> as well as the want of a principle of divine love in them, and &s;o doubles the &s;inners guilt; it mu&s;t be concluded, that the former is a part of duty as well as the latter; and that there is an obligation to both conjunctly, and to each &s;everally.</P>
<P>Perhaps we have not yet fully hit the joint. If not I hope we &s;hall at length find it, in examining the other propo&s;ition, viz.
<Q>External duties of re|ligion are not required for their own &s;akes, or in them&s;elves con&s;idered; but only as proper ways of exerci&s;ing and expre&s;&s;ing love to God.</Q></P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e a few things for the better under&s;tanding of what is here a&s;&s;erted, which as it lies may not appear &s;o plain. External duties are of two kinds, moral and po&s;itive. To &s;peak and behave reverently in re&s;pect to God, ju&s;tly truly and kindly towards men, &s;eem to be duties of perpetual obligation, on &s;uppo&s;ition that we have power and occa&s;ion of &s;peaking, and acting at all. Now there is a fitne&s;s and goodne&s;s in &s;uch a manner of beha|viour, a &s;uitablene&s;s to our &s;tate and relations; and a contrary behaviour would be naturally un&s;eemly and pernicious. There is a goodne&s;s in right actions con&s;idered in them&s;elves, and therefore they are fit expre&s;&s;ions of good affections. External actions are not like words in them&s;elves equally fit to expre&s;s any idea. There is truth righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s in &s;peech and behaviour, as well as in the &s;entiments and affections of the heart. Whatever principle a man acts from, lying, acts of inju&s;tice and cruelty, are un|fit and evil in them&s;elves; and on the contrary acts of righteou&s;ne&s;s and mercy are in them&s;elves right.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="012416_0118_0F89748F33F3BE60">There are other external duties which are called po&s;itive. The &s;ub&s;tance of &s;uch actions is not in it|&s;elf of nece&s;&s;ary obligation, but is &s;anctified and en|joined merely by the &s;overeign will of God. Of this kind are in&s;titutions of religious wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Concerning external duties it is enquired, 1. Whe|ther they are required <HI>for their own &s;akes?</HI> If the meaning be, whether they are required becau&s;e right and fit in them&s;elves, and not in their own nature ab|&s;olutely indifferent, I an&s;wer po&s;itive duties are not required for their own &s;akes. The performance of them is good becau&s;e required, not required becau&s;e good in it&s;elf. But to &s;peak the truth, to do ju&s;tly, to behave reverently towards God, are duties in them|&s;elves fit. There is a goodne&s;s in &s;uch a manner of conduct; and it may truly be &s;aid that the&s;e things are required for their own &s;akes, or becau&s;e right in them&s;elves; though perhaps this may not be the &s;ole rea&s;on of their requirement. Po&s;itive duties are re|quired not for their own &s;akes, but for &s;ome further end. Actions morally good may be and are requi|red partly for their own &s;akes, and partly as in&s;tru|mental to other purpo&s;es di&s;tinct from the perfor|mance. If then unregenerate &s;inners may perform external duties, good in them&s;elves, as has been prov|ed, it mu&s;t be concluded that this is required of them. And if they can attend in&s;trumental duties, &s;o as that their attendance &s;hall be conducive to the end for which they are required, as &s;hall in due time be proved; their not being required for their own &s;akes will not at all weaken our argument, that &s;uch an attendance is in it&s;elf their duty.</P>
<P N="2">2. Are external duties of religion required <HI>in them|&s;elves con&s;idered?</HI> If this means the &s;ame with the former enquiry, it has now been an&s;wered. But it &s;eems Mr. H. in denying this, intends &s;omething fur|ther;
<PB N="115" REF="012416_0119_0F89748FF1CAA888">
viz. That what are called external duties of religion, materially con&s;idered, or <HI>in &s;en&s;u divi&s;o,</HI> are not required but upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that they are conjoined with and flow from love to God. That is, the&s;e things are <HI>duties</HI> if they are true expre&s;&s;ions and fruits of love to God, otherwi&s;e they are not required at mens hands. To open this a little it may be no|ted, that &s;ome duties are binding upon us as moral agents, without implying or pre&s;uppo&s;ing any other qualifications than natural capacities and advantages for obedience. Such are the duties of loving God and our neighbour. Other duties are required of men only con&s;equentially, or <HI>on &s;uppo&s;ition</HI> that they are &s;ubjects <HI>thus qualified,</HI> and the action be <HI>thus per|formed.</HI> It may be their pre&s;ent duty to be thus qua|lified, and &s;o to do the duty con&s;equentially required without any delay; yet the doing of it while unqua|lified is not a duty; it is not required, and ought not to be done. And &s;ome circum&s;tances though not e&s;&s;ential to an action, <HI>as an action,</HI> may yet be e&s;&s;en|tial to it, <HI>as a duty required.</HI> Thus though it be the pre&s;ent duty of tho&s;e who have had &s;ufficient means of in&s;truction, to believe in Chri&s;t and profe&s;s their faith; yet it is not the duty of any one to profe&s;s faith until he does believe. Profe&s;&s;ion, bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper are duties <HI>on &s;uppo&s;ition,</HI> that the &s;ubjects are qualified according to the rules of the go&s;pel. Though it may be the &s;in of an unbeliever that he does not now join him&s;elf to the chri&s;tian church, yet it would be a greater &s;in for him to pro|fe&s;s faith, and be baptized, while con&s;cious that he is an infidel. It may be the pre&s;ent duty of a profe&s;&s;|ed chri&s;tian to partake of the Lord's &s;upper; yet it is not his duty to eat and drink at the Lord's table unle&s;s he do it <HI>religiou&s;ly,</HI> in remembrance of Chri&s;t. And if any one &s;hould do the outward action, meerly
<PB N="116" REF="012416_0120_0F897490B2B7C7A8">
to &s;atisfy his hunger, qualify him&s;elf for a commi&s;&s;ion, or gratify an intemperate appetite for wine, without any religious views; we might truly &s;ay that what he does is no duty at all, but a great &s;in; becau&s;e a re|ligious manner of eating and drinking is e&s;&s;ential to partaking of the Lord's &s;upper, <HI>as a duty</HI>; and we ought not to do the outward action at all unle&s;s we do it religiou&s;ly. In this ca&s;e though we cannot &s;ay that the qualification of the per&s;on, and the religious manner of the performance, is the only thing requi|red, and that the whole of the duty lies in this, (for external actions are al&s;o required) yet we grant that the&s;e circum&s;tances are e&s;&s;ential to the outward acti|ons, con&s;idered as duties;
<Q>and where the&s;e are want|ing, the externals are as to duty an empty nothing, or rather much wor&s;e than nothing, and in doing them no duty is done</Q>; and that for this plain rea|&s;on, becau&s;e the&s;e externals are required <HI>only on &s;up|po&s;ition</HI>
of the&s;e other requi&s;ites; and con&s;equently the&s;e adjuncts belong to the &s;ub&s;tance and matter of the <HI>duty,</HI> though they belong not to the &s;ub&s;tance of the <HI>outward action</HI>: Which action is a commanded duty only in the compounded and not in the divided &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>This appears to be Mr. H's meaning, when he &s;ays, that the unregenerate in attending the externals of religion, do nothing that is their duty. He con&s;i|ders the&s;e things as enjoined on men only on &s;uppo|&s;ition that they are regenerate, and have a holy love to God. For he &s;ays,
<Q>they are required only as expre&s;&s;ions of love to God.</Q>
Expre&s;&s;ions of love, as &s;uch, are duties only on &s;uppo&s;ition of love. Now as it is the main de&s;ign of this &s;ection to confute this notion, it will not be nece&s;&s;ary that we detain the rea|der long, by framing a full reply to this exception, before we proceed to our en&s;uing arguments. Yet a few things may be hinted briefly.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="117" REF="012416_0121_0F897491766E24A0">1. If this be true, then it is as unlawful for an un|regenerate &s;inner to &s;peak the truth, do an act of ju&s;tice or kindne&s;s to a neighbour, re&s;cue his parent when in danger of death, to read or hear the word of God, or pray to him for any mercy temporal or &s;piritual, or do any external action whatever; as it would be for an unbeliever contrary to his inward per&s;ua&s;ion to profe&s;s faith, be baptized, and come to the Lord's table purely to get drunk. For the re|quirement of duties only on &s;uppo&s;ition of regenera|tion and love to God, implies the prohibition of them, in all other ca&s;es. It is as unlawful for one who has not a holy love to God, to do any thing required only as an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch love, as it is for one who has no religious regard to Chri&s;t, to do an action required only as an expre&s;&s;ion of religious regard to him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Then it is a greater &s;in for an unregenerate &s;in|ner to read and hear God's word, and pray to him, than to refrain from it; even as it is a greater &s;in for an infidel to profe&s;s faith, &amp;c. than not to do it. For a duty required only on &s;uppo&s;ition of love to God, is, by one who has not this qualification, and while he has it not, omitted with le&s;s guilt than done.</P>
<P N="3">3. Then it is as unwarrantable and pre&s;umptuous for any one, whether regenerate or not, to endeavour an attendance on an external duty of religion, until he has &s;ome prevailing evidence that his endeavours are &s;incere expre&s;&s;ions of holy love, as it is for a man to offer him&s;elf to bapti&s;m, or to join in partaking at the Lord's table, without a prevailing per&s;ua&s;ion that he is in a good mea&s;ure qualified for it, and &s;hall at|tend the ordinance in a religious manner. It is in|deed mens fault when they do not love God: So it is if they (enjoying go&s;pel privileges) are not qualified for the outward &s;eals of the covenant. Yet while
<PB N="118" REF="012416_0122_0F89749230B99E18">
they are unqualified they ought to refrain from them, and while they have no evidence of their qualifica|tions, they are, in the judgment of their con&s;ciences, unqualified, and &s;o obliged to refrain. And thus e|very one who has no prevailing per&s;ua&s;ion of his be|ing a lover of God, mu&s;t in con&s;cience refrain from &s;uch actions as are required only on &s;uppo&s;ition of holy love, and as expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame; as for in|&s;tance, from declaring that he has &s;uch love, and ac|cording to Mr. H's &s;cheme from every other exter|nal duty.</P>
<P N="4">4. Then there is the &s;ame rea&s;on to caution and warn men again&s;t pre&s;uming to read and hear the word of God, to pray to him, or attend on any ex|ternal duty of religion, until they fir&s;t find &s;ome evi|dence that they either are, or &s;hall be regenerated in and with the attempt; as there is to warn men not to come to the Lord's table until they find &s;ome evi|dence of their being duly qualified for it.</P>
<P>I could ea&s;ily go on further, but I forbear. Me|thinks the&s;e con&s;equences are &s;o intolerable, that no principle ought to be admitted from which they can fairly be deduced. If they can fairly be avoided on Mr. H's plan, let it be &s;hewn.</P>
<P>It is true the external duties of religion are in them|&s;elves fit ways wherein love to God may be exerci&s;ed and expre&s;&s;ed, and it is the duty of all men to exer|ci&s;e love to God in attending on them. But it is mo&s;t fal&s;e to &s;ay, that they are required only as ex|erci&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions of holy love. They are re|quired in the go&s;pel primarily and principally <HI>as means,</HI> through the &s;pirit's influence, of enlightening, con|vincing, converting and &s;anctifying tho&s;e who are cho&s;en in Chri&s;t to &s;alvation: As al&s;o of re&s;training the out-breakings of &s;in in many others, and &s;o pre|venting the bad con&s;equences in this world. And
<PB N="119" REF="012416_0123_0F897493BAF67F68">
&s;uch an attendance on the external duties of religion, as does not imply any exerci&s;es of true love to God, may be well adapted to &s;ub&s;erve &s;everal of tho&s;e ends for which they are required; as for in&s;tance, to pro|mote the pre&s;ent welfare of mankind, to awaken and humble &s;inners, prepare them for regeneration, and lead them on to a &s;aving conver&s;ion. Why then &s;hould any think that &s;uch an attendance is not the duty of men, previous to regeneration?</P>
<P>Whether the argument hitherto in&s;i&s;ted on and de|fended be not valid, notwith&s;tanding what has yet been urged to enervate it, let the unbia&s;&s;ed judge. Mr. H. indeed takes the freedom at the clo&s;e of his fir&s;t plea again&s;t "unregenerate duties" (as well as at other times) to &s;eat him&s;elf a while upon the bench. He has given his judgment
<Q>that the &s;hort plain argument he has con&s;idered is quite &s;ufficient to end the di&s;pute.</Q>
But it may be doubted, whether it be proper for every <HI>pleader</HI> to follow the precedent. Some liberties appear well enough in great men, which would &s;carce be thought mode&s;t in per&s;ons of mean rank. Perhaps our author was how|ever a little too &s;anguine in concluding &s;o perempto|rily,
<Q>that it is as demon&s;trably evident that there is no obedience but what con&s;i&s;ts in love, as any truth contained in divine revelation, and mu&s;t approve it&s;elf to the rea&s;on of every one who will exerci&s;e his rea&s;on, and not confu&s;e and bewilder him&s;elf with a &s;et of words without meaning.</Q>
Pag. 117. On what evidence this conclu&s;ion &s;tands we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P N="2">II. Our point may be further proved from &s;undry texts of &s;cripture. The fir&s;t I &s;hall produce is the conference between our Savior and the &s;cribe, re|corded in Mark xii. 28,&mdash;34. <HI>And one of the &s;cribes came, and having heard them rea&s;oning toge|ther,
<PB N="120" REF="012416_0124_0F897494C753EE48">
and perceiving that he had an&s;wered them well, a&s;ked him, Which is the fir&s;t commandment of all? And Je&s;us an&s;wered him, The fir&s;t of all the commandments is, Hear, O I&s;rael; the Lord our God is one Lord: And thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy &s;trength. This is the fir&s;t command|ment. And the &s;econd is like, namely this, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf. There is none other commandment greater than the&s;e. And the &s;cribe &s;aid unto him, Well, ma&s;ter, thou ha&s;t &s;aid the truth: For there is one God, and there is none other but he. And to love him with all the heart, and with all the under&s;tanding, and with all the &s;oul, and with all the &s;trength, and to love his neighbour as him&s;elf, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices. And, when Je&s;us &s;aw that he an&s;wered di&s;creetly, he &s;aid unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that dur&s;t a&s;k him any que&s;tion.</HI></P>
<P>It may &s;eem a little remarkable, that arguments concluding in direct contradiction to each other, &s;hould be founded on this conference. Mr. H's prin|cipal argument to di&s;prove "unregenerate duties," is taken from this di&s;cour&s;e of our Lord as related by Matthew, chap. xxii. 37,&mdash;39. In &s;tating and vin|dicating our argument from this pa&s;&s;age, we &s;hall be unavoidably led to examine Mr. H's rea&s;oning on the matter, which would otherwi&s;e have been referred to another place.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion which this &s;cribe put to our Savior, was not, "what is the &s;um of all the commands and of man's duty as contained in them? He did not conceive that the whole duty of man was expre&s;&s;ed in one or two commands. It would be evidently improper on this &s;uppo&s;ition to enquire which is the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that is the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> commandment of <HI>all.</HI> It
<PB N="121" REF="012416_0125_0F8974953359E3A8">
&s;eems to have been a point di&s;puted among the Jewi&s;h doctors, which of all the commands of the law was to be accounted the greate&s;t. And this &s;cribe ob|&s;erving that Je&s;us had an&s;wered the &s;adducees well was de&s;irous to hear his judgment of this great que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Our Savior in his reply directly re&s;olves the point propo&s;ed, declaring expre&s;ly that the fir&s;t and great commandment is to love God with all the heart. To which he adds the &s;econd requiring the love of our neighbour. Though the &s;cribe's que&s;tion was only concerning the greate&s;t command of all, yet as the &s;econd was like the fir&s;t, it is with good rea&s;on con|joined with it; and the rather becau&s;e it &s;eems to have been a prevailing error among the Jewi&s;h teach|ers, that the &s;ocial virtues were not very important, provided men were but zealous and exact in attend|ing ordinances of divine wor&s;hip. Be&s;ides, the&s;e two commandments have the clo&s;e&s;t connection. He that truly loves God loves his neighbour al&s;o. Our Lord therefore joining the&s;e two great moral precepts to|gether, which may be con&s;idered as a kind of &s;um|mary of the moral law, adds, "there is no other commandment greater than the&s;e," that is, the&s;e are the greate&s;t: There is no other of equal importance. Now here are two things to be carefully noted.</P>
<P N="1">1. It was not our Savior's de&s;ign to comprehend all the commands of God in the&s;e two great precepts. This is evident, becau&s;e he refers to other commands, and draws a compari&s;on between the&s;e other, and tho&s;e two great ones of which he had been &s;peaking. To &s;ay that the law of love is greater than the other commands, implies that there are other commands. The comparative terms <HI>greater</HI> and <HI>le&s;s</HI> are relative, and nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e their correlatives. Nor can it be &s;aid, that the&s;e other commands, with which the
<PB N="122" REF="012416_0126_0F897495F12B6AE8">
law of love &s;tands compared, are contained in it. For they are plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed from it; they are called <HI>other commands.</HI> A part of any thing cannot be called another thing than that in which it is con|tained. Be&s;ides, if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that the com|pari&s;on is between the whole of the divine law and &s;ome particular commands contained in it, our Savior's &s;aying "there is no other commandment greater than the&s;e," would amount to no more than this, that a part is not greater than the whole: Which would be trifling and unin&s;tructive.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tho&s;e other commands, with which the great precepts of the law are compared, do not contain in them tho&s;e which require the love of God and our neighbour. For if they did, they would not be other commands, but the very &s;ame, with only the addition of &s;ome new requirements. And be&s;ides, the pre|cepts requiring the love of God and our neighbour, are &s;aid to be greater than the other; which would be palpably ab&s;urd, if the law of love were involved in the&s;e other. It would be &s;aying that the law of love is greater than the &s;ame law, with the&s;e other precepts taken together. That is, that a part is grea|ter than the whole; that the love of God and our neighbour is a greater duty, than a duty which con|tains in it the love of God and our neighbour.</P>
<P>How can the&s;e con&s;equences be avoided? Will any pretend that to &s;ay "there is no other command|ment greater than the&s;e," does not nece&s;&s;arily imply that there is any other? This would be charging our Lord with gro&s;s impropriety of language. Had he thought that tho&s;e two commandments contained all, he would have &s;aid there is no other commandment <HI>be&s;ides the&s;e.</HI> Or if there were any doubt about the matter, the an&s;wer of the &s;cribe, which was approved as di&s;creet, mu&s;t &s;atisfy it. Says he, to love God and
<PB N="123" REF="012416_0127_0F897496B32CFB90">
our neighbour is more than all whole burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices. Here tho&s;e commanded duties are mentioned, with which the love of God and our neighbour are compared; and which we have &s;hewn are di&s;tinct from it, neither containing it nor contained in it, in the &s;en&s;e here intended. Religious ordinan|ces laid an obligation of obedience on tho&s;e to whom they were given: Yet they were not &s;o important as the love of God and our neighbour. This is the &s;en&s;e and &s;cope of our Lord's di&s;cour&s;e; which is parallel with what he afterwards &s;aid, when reproving the partiality and hypocri&s;y of the &s;cribes and phari|&s;ees in their religious obedience. Says he,
<Q>ye tithe mint ani&s;e and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith (with the love of God. Luk. 11.42) the&s;e ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. 23.23.</NOTE> This text is al&s;o much to our purpo&s;e, and the &s;ame conclu&s;ions will flow from it. Paying tithes is here declared to be a duty, or what ought to be done; and another duty di&s;tinct from the weightier matters of the law. But this text is &s;o &s;im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lar in meaning and expre&s;&s;ion, to what has ju&s;t been con&s;idered, that 'tis needle&s;s to make more particular ob&s;ervations on it.</P>
<P>From the whole we conclude that an attendance on religious ordinances is enjoined on men by other commands than tho&s;e which enjoin holy love. And con&s;equently &s;omething is required as matter of duty different from love, and which does not in it&s;elf ne|ce&s;&s;arily imply any exerci&s;es of &s;uch love. There is therefore an obligation on tho&s;e to whom the word of &s;alvation is &s;ent, to attend the in&s;tituted means of grace, be&s;ides the obligation they are under to do it in the exerci&s;e of true love to God. Our Savior's
<PB N="124" REF="012416_0128_0F897497724AC568">
determination upon the ca&s;e propo&s;ed to him, fur|ni&s;hes us with a &s;ure principle for our determinations, with re&s;pect to the po&s;itive precepts of the go&s;pel. Such an attendance on the means of grace is required as does not in it&s;elf nece&s;&s;arily imply or pre&s;uppo&s;e regeneration, or the actings of faith and love; that is, &s;uch an attendance as men have a power for while unregenerate. And this obligation re&s;pects all reli|gious ordinances, except &s;uch as may evidently ap|pear to be limited and appropriated to qualified &s;ub|jects, that is, to believers, as tho&s;e ordinances which are called &s;acraments I &s;uppo&s;e are. And we may by parity of rea&s;on conclude that &s;uch external acts of obedience to moral precepts as the unregenerate by God's common a&s;&s;i&s;tance are able to perform, are al&s;o commanded duties.</P>
<P>Let us now take a view of Mr. H's rea&s;oning from this conference, where we have the argument on which he &s;eems chiefly to depend, and which, if we will take his judgment, is quite &s;ufficient to end the di&s;pute. I mu&s;t now anticipate a little the bu&s;ine&s;s of the next &s;ection, and for a while take the place of <HI>re&s;pondent.</HI></P>
<P>Says he,
<Q>According to our Savior's account of the divine law or commandment (Mat. 22.37,&mdash;39) it requires nothing but love to God and our neigh|bour.</Q>
P. 116. An&s;wer, Our Savior's words as related by Matthew, prove no &s;uch thing as is here a&s;&s;erted; and as related by Mark they imply the very rever&s;e. Mr. H. adds,
<Q>He expre&s;ly &s;ays on the&s;e two commandments hang all the law and the prophets, (ver. 40.) That is, all that is required in the law and in the prophets, every injunction and command to be found in divine revelation really requires nothing but love to God and our neigh|bour.</Q>
P. 117. An&s;w. But this interpretation of
<PB N="125" REF="012416_0129_0F89749832F1A040">
our Savior's words is contrary to rea&s;on and &s;cripture, and for what yet appears has nothing to &s;upport it but Mr. H's authority; which (without di&s;paragement) may he confronted by an authority no way inferior, that is by the authority of the &s;ame Mr. H. who in a pa&s;&s;age lately produced acknowledges that the exter|nals of religion are in &s;ome ca&s;es required. But per|haps our author does not mean that the inward af|fection of love is all that is required, but
<Q>Love act|ed out and expre&s;&s;ed is all proper ways.</Q>
Ibid. An&s;w. By love acted out and expre&s;&s;ed, I conceive nothing can be intended but the external fruits and expre&s;&s;ions of love, which however they may be con|founded with love under figurative expre&s;&s;ions, are in nature as diver&s;e from it as any other effect is from it's cau&s;e. We do indeed allow that nothing is re|quired as duty, but what is either implied in the affection of love, or is a fit way of exerci&s;ing and expre&s;&s;ing it; nothing which may not be con&s;idered as comprehended in love, if not formally, yet virtu|ally and radically, as being apt to flow from it, as an effect from it's cau&s;e, or an act from it's habit. But that no external duties of religion are required, but &s;uch as <HI>actually</HI> flow from love, and to imply the ex|erci&s;es of it, (which I think is the mo&s;t candid &s;en&s;e in which Mr. H's words can be taken) is not at all proved by our Savior's words, and is untrue, as has been &s;hewn from this very pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, and &s;hall be further demon&s;trated. But Mr. H. pro|ceeds&mdash;
<Q>No other natural and ea&s;y &s;en&s;e can be put upon the&s;e words of Chri&s;t;</Q>
(How can we know that?)
<Q>But would they bear another &s;en&s;e, what St. Paul &s;ays on the &s;ame &s;ubject, fixes the mean|ing of them. He &s;ays, he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. And again, Love is the fulfilling of the law. Love could not be the ful|filling
<PB N="126" REF="012416_0130_0F897498F24A09E8">
of the law, if the law required any thing more than love acted out to a perfect degree, and in a proper manner. Love is therefore the whole duty of man. Nothing more nor le&s;s is required. God has not given one precept to man in the law or the prophets, in the old te&s;tament or new, but what requires love to God, or man, or both; and is to be obeyed in the exerci&s;e of love, and no o|ther way, or by nothing el&s;e. There is therefore no obedience but what con&s;i&s;ts in love; and where there is nothing of this there is no duty done; nothing that is required, and is due, is given.</Q>
P. 117.</P>
<P>I have now given the reader the intire argument with which Mr. H. would prove that nothing more or le&s;s than love is required: On which we may note&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. Here is nothing tending to enervate the proofs we have given, that there are other commands be|&s;ides the great ones our Savior &s;peaks of.</P>
<P N="2">2. If love be taken in it's proper &s;en&s;e for an af|fection or immanent act of the will, it will be flatly contrary to the current of &s;cripture, and to divers of Mr. H's expre&s;&s;ions, to &s;ay that nothing be&s;ides love is required. It is certain that good works as well as love are commanded duties.</P>
<P N="3">3. We have no rea&s;on to think that love in the texts of &s;cripture above referred to is to be under|&s;tood as including all tho&s;e acts of external obedience which flow from it. It does not appear that it is ever u&s;ed in &s;o exten&s;ive a &s;en&s;e in the &s;criptures. Mr. H. be&s;ure has offered nothing to prove that it is, unle&s;s the words of the apo&s;tle,
<Q>Love is the fulfilling of the law,</Q>
may be thought to imply it; which will be con&s;idered immediately.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="127" REF="012416_0131_0F897499B08E7B20">4. There is nothing in the &s;hape of an argument to prove that nothing more or le&s;s than love is required, except two texts of &s;cripture, viz. Mat. 22.40. Rom. 13.8, 9. If then the&s;e texts &s;hould be capa|ble of a con&s;truction different from what he has giv|en, his argument will come to nothing. Now it does not appear that there is any nece&s;&s;ity of taking the&s;e texts in the &s;en&s;e he has given, and indeed if they are clo&s;ely examined they will not bear that &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>When our Savior &s;ays,
<Q>On the&s;e two command|ments hang all the law and the prophets,</Q>
he is &s;peaking of commandments which he had ju&s;t been comparing with and declaring greater than others, and which were con&s;equently diver&s;e from tho&s;e o|thers to which they are preferred. And there is nothing in the expre&s;&s;ion here u&s;ed that &s;o much as intimates that every command in divine revelation really requires nothing but love. On the contrary when one thing is &s;aid to hang on another, we na|turally conceive of a difference between them. All the law and the prophets may properly be &s;aid to hang on the&s;e two commandments, if the&s;e are grea|ter than any other; if the&s;e are the foundation, the ultimate end of other precepts, and indeed of the whole of divine revelation, which is de&s;igned to re|cover men to the love of God and their neighbour; if other duties required in the word of God naturally and regularly flow from love as their principle or efficient cau&s;e. It &s;eems to me that the phra&s;e here u&s;ed cannot, without &s;training, be made to compre|hend much more, at lea&s;t it cannot bear Mr. H's con&s;truction: Nor has he hinted one rea&s;on for his &s;en&s;e of the words, except his referring to the words of St. Paul, which he &s;uppo&s;es to be parallel and to fix the meaning of this text, may pa&s;s for a rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="012416_0132_0F89749B4D32EFD0">Our whole bu&s;ine&s;s then is to attend to this pa&s;&s;age of the apo&s;tle here referred to, which taken in it's connection is as follows. Rom. xiii. 7&mdash;10.
<Q>Ren|der therefore to all their dues, &amp;c. O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e no man any thing but to love one another, for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou &s;halt not commit adultery. Thou &s;halt not kill. Thou &s;halt not &s;teal. Thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s. Thou &s;halt not covet. And if there be any other commandment it is briefly com|prehended (anakephalaioutai) in this &s;aying namely, thou &s;halt love thy neigbhour as thy &s;elf. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour, therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</Q>
On the&s;e words we may ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the apo&s;tle &s;eems evidently to &s;peak of the law in a limited &s;en&s;e, meaning only what is called the &s;econd table; containing our duty to our neighbour. At mo&s;t it comprehends only the moral law. Now if it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed that the <HI>moral law</HI> requires nothing but love, this will not prove that there are no <HI>ordinances</HI> pertaining to the external wor&s;hip of God which require any thing be&s;ides love. For that law of which the apo&s;tle is &s;peaking does not contain every divine command. It does not contain po&s;itive precepts, which (as we learn from our Savior's words) are di&s;tinct from that law which obliges us to love our neighbour as our&s;elves. God by his &s;overeign authority may have enjoined exter|nal duties of religion of a quite different kind, for any thing that can be argued to the contrary from this text.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is certain that the moral law, and even the &s;econd table requires &s;omething be&s;ides love, in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e. It requires acts of kindne&s;s. And it al&s;o requires a <HI>due degree</HI> of love, and endeavour to
<PB N="129" REF="012416_0133_0F89749C03185FA8">
do good. If then love be taken in &s;o large and qua|lified a &s;en&s;e as to include the whole of our duty, or a perfect conformity to the law in all re&s;pects; then it is true, that this is &s;trictly the fulfilling of the law; and every one in whom this is found has fulfilled the law. But then I &s;ay that &s;omething le&s;s than perfect obedience is al&s;o required of us by God. Something is our duty, which in it&s;elf is not a complete fulfill|ment of the whole law. The exerci&s;es and actings of love in true chri&s;tians are commanded duties, though by rea&s;on of their imperfection they are not the fulfilling of the law. The&s;e and much more are their duty. True it is, that nothing more can be re|quired of any one than to fulfill the law. But this will never prove that nothing le&s;s, is in any ca&s;e re|quired. The whole of our duty in a perfect degree, and each part, in all it's degrees is jointly and &s;eve|rally required. That holine&s;s which is perfectly an|&s;werable to the law is our duty; and &s;uch acts of holine&s;s as are imperfect, and con&s;equently are not the fulfilling of the law are our duty: And external duties of religi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, though in them&s;elves they have not the complete e&s;&s;ence of true holine&s;s, yet are a part of that duty whereby the divine command is fulfilled. The &s;ub&s;tance of the duty is enjoined as well as it's circum&s;tances. That ought to be done, and the&s;e not omitted, though the &s;ub&s;tance of exter|nal duties without love be not go&s;pel holine&s;s; and though go&s;pel holine&s;s being imperfect in degree be not the fulfilling of the law, or the whole duty there|in required.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that any act of obedience is a fulfill|ing the law: I an&s;wer, it may be &s;o termed in &s;ome &s;en&s;e: It is a doing &s;omething required in the law. But this is not the &s;en&s;e in which the apo&s;tle u&s;es the phra&s;e. He means the whole of our duty in it's full
<PB N="130" REF="012416_0134_0F89749CB1613088">
extent. But if the apo&s;tle intended by the fulfilling of the law, only a particular act of obedience, then his &s;aying that love is an in&s;tance of obedience to the law, does not imply but that there may be many o|ther in&s;tances. Love and the fruits of love, and actions materially good though de&s;titute of holy love, may all con&s;i&s;tently enough be in&s;tances of duty, by doing of which we <HI>in this &s;en&s;e</HI> fulfil or obey the law in &s;ome re&s;pect. If it be &s;aid that, every in&s;tance of obedience or duty implies &s;ome degree of holy love, this is only begging the que&s;tion. But,</P>
<P N="3">3. If we attend carefully to the apo&s;tles words, it will I think plainly appear, that there are other duties we owe to our neighbour be&s;ides love, in the &s;en&s;e here intended.
<Q>Owe no man any thing but to love one another, for he that loveth,</Q>
&amp;c. The apo&s;tle here evidently mentions other debts or duties owing to others be&s;ides love. Such as rendring to every one his due. And he ob&s;erves a notable difference between this debt of love, and tho&s;e others; viz. that the&s;e mu&s;t be di&s;charged by actual payment; which when we have done, we &s;hall owe them no longer. But that other debt of love we &s;hall always owe our neighbour, though we &s;hould owe him no|thing el&s;e. The apo&s;tle here di&s;tingui&s;hes between rendring to all their due, and loving one another: He compares and oppo&s;es the&s;e different duties to each other: Which &s;hews that the former are not included in love in the &s;en&s;e here intended. I &s;ee not how any tolerable &s;en&s;e can be made of the text, if love be under&s;tood to contain tho&s;e other duties which are compared with it. For then the meaning mu&s;t &s;tand thus:
<Q>Owe no man any thing except love, that is, except tribute, cu&s;tom, fear, honour and every thing el&s;e which is ever due from one man to another&punc;</Q>
The bare recital of which is a
<PB N="131" REF="012416_0135_0F89749D710817F0">
&s;ufficient confutation. And thus the words of Paul pointed to by Mr. H. confirm the &s;en&s;e we have given of our Savior's words. They both appear to u&s;e the word love in it's proper &s;en&s;e: And neither of them comprizes in it all acts of external obedience: And con&s;equently Mr. H's a&s;&s;ertion,
<Q>That nothing more or le&s;s than love is required,</Q>
not only wants proof, but is fully confuted, and convicted of fal&s;hood from tho&s;e very texts by which he endeavours to maintain it.</P>
<P>But it may be enquired, Why is love called the fulfilling of the law; and he that loveth another &s;aid to have fulfilled the law; and all the commandments of the &s;econd table comprehended briefly in this &s;ay|ing, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf?&mdash; This may ea&s;ily and &s;atisfactorily be an&s;wered, I con|ceive, if we will not cut the ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tles words to the quick, which &s;ome expo&s;itors perhaps have too much done. The learned <HI>Toletus</HI> &s;eems to have given the true meaning of this pa&s;&s;age as follows.
<Q>The law is &s;aid to be fulfilled two manner of ways. 1. When each of the precepts are fulfilled in particular, &amp;c. 2. When that is done on which the whole law de|pends, or unto which the whole law is ordained or framed, or by which the whole law is performed. And thus he that loveth hath fulfilled the whole law; as well becau&s;e love is the principle, cau&s;e and root of all other things which are commanded; as becau&s;e love is the end or &s;cope of all the com|mandments of the law according to 1 Tim. 1.5. as al&s;o becau&s;e it exhibits the manner wherein the other commandments are perfectly done, namely from love.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Pol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Synop&s;. in loc.</NOTE> And when all the other command|ments are &s;aid to be briefly comprehended under this,
<PB N="132" REF="012416_0136_0F89749E34367098">
Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf; this can|not intend that they are &s;trictly and formally, but only that they are as it were radically contained there|in; as love is an operative principle, di&s;po&s;ing and prompting to all other duties to our neighbour. Or perhaps the original word may only import that the other commands are connected with this as their head, or capital principle: And then the meaning will very much coincide with that of our Savior's words before explained, "On their two command|ments hang all the law and the prophets."</P>
<P>But whether this be the full and exact meaning of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions or not, certain it is that this pa&s;&s;age neither requires nor indeed will bear Mr. H's con|&s;truction. And &s;o we have con&s;idered the whole e|vidence on which depends the truth of his <HI>major propo&s;ition,</HI>
<Q>that the divine law enjoins nothing more or le&s;s than love.</Q>
<HI>The a&s;&s;umption,</HI> viz. "The unregenerate have no true (i e. holy) love to God and their neighbour," we di&s;pute not; though we cannot admit the rea&s;on immediately &s;ubjoined, viz. That "unregeneracy con&s;i&s;ts in want of love, and in con&s;equent exerci&s;es of enmity." For it has been &s;hewn to con&s;i&s;t in the privation of a holy prin|ciple, and not in any act or the privation of any act.</P>
<P>We have now &s;u&s;tained the attack of our author's grand battery; and have I hope maintained our ground again&s;t it. Whether we have not al&s;o been able to &s;ilence it, and even take it out of his hands, and turn it to good effect again&s;t him&s;elf, that is, to impugn his own tenet, let &s;uch as exerci&s;e their rea|&s;on judge. I doubt Mr. H. tru&s;ted a little too much to his pre&s;&s;ed forces. Soldiers are very apt to de&s;ert a cau&s;e, in which they are con&s;trained to &s;erve again&s;t their will.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="133" REF="012416_0137_0F89749EF25807F0">III. We will now again re&s;ume the labouring oar, and proceed in our pre&s;ent ta&s;k: That is, to prove that &s;omething is required of men in a way of duty which they are able to do while unregenerate. And the next argument is taken from the apo&s;tle's words, Rom. 2.14.
<Q>When the Gentiles who have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law, the&s;e having not the law are a law to them&s;elves.</Q>
The de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle in the beginning of this epi&s;tle is to prove that both Jews and Gentiles are under &s;in. But &s;ince there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion where there is no law, it might be objected, that the Gentiles not having the law &s;eem not to be guilty of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing it. To this the apo&s;tle an&s;wers, that though the Gentiles have not the written law, yet they have the work or impre&s;&s;ion of the law of nature on their hearts, in tho&s;e notions of right and wrong which they are naturally furni&s;hed with. This appears, 1. from their con&s;cienciou&s;ly doing &s;ome things contain|ed in and enjoined by the divine law.
<Q>Though they have not the law, &s;aith the apo&s;tle, they &s;hew f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rth the work of it, they do many things which it requireth, and forbear or ab&s;tain from many things which it forbiddeth, and &s;o &s;hew forth it's work and efficacy.</Q>

<P>Of the&s;e per&s;ons it is &s;aid that they do the things contained in the law. This is the medium or argu|ment by which the apo&s;tle proves that they are a law to them&s;elves. The form of expre&s;&s;ion may &s;eem hy|pothetical, "<HI>When</HI> the Gentiles do," &amp;c. but the meaning is plainly categorical. q. d. Since the Gen|tiles do the things contained in the law, it appears that they are a law to them&s;elves. The con&s;equence mu&s;t &s;tand or fall with it's antecedent.</P>
<P>Now whatever actions are contained in or required by the law, are commanded duties: But by the te&s;ti|mony of Paul, the moral virtues of the unregenerate heathen are things contained in the law, or as <HI>Calvin</HI> renders it, <HI>works of the law</HI>; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In&s;tit. lib. 2. chap. 2. &s;ect 22.</NOTE> that is, works requi|red by the law. Therefore &s;ome actions of the unre|generate are commanded duties. And this, by the way, directly proves that a virtuous life, as well as an attendance on ordinances of religious wor&s;hip, is the duty of men previous to regeneration.</P>
<P>The&s;e things the Gentiles do <HI>by nature.</HI> I do not &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e words were meant to exclude all divine influence prompting and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the powers of nature to action; yet they doubtle&s;s exclude the influence of &s;upernatural &s;anctifying grace; and &s;o leave no room to doubt that the per&s;ons &s;poken of are unregenerate.</P>
<P>But there is an exception to this te&s;timony, that de&s;erves &s;ome con&s;ideration. The phra&s;e in the ori|ginal (ta tou nomou) which is here tran&s;lated
<Q>the things contained in the law,</Q>
is more literally ren|dred <HI>the things of the law.</HI> And a learned writer <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Glas's Works, Vol. 3. pag. 25.</NOTE> thinks that the meaning of the text is not that the
<PB N="135" REF="012416_0139_0F8974A072797688">
Gentiles do any duties contained in, or enjoined by the law; but that they do
<Q>the offices of the law to them&s;elves or the things which pertain to the law to do. And this</Q>
he &s;ays
<Q><HI>is &s;upported by the words immediately following,</HI> the&s;e having not the law are a law to them&s;elves, which &s;hew the work of the law written in their hearts.</Q>
Whether Mr. H. would follow this interpretation of the text I know not; he having taken no notice of it. How|ever we will attend to it. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Whereas it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the following words, "The&s;e having not the law are a law to them&s;elves," are an evidence that the Gentiles doing the things of the law means their doing the things which the law does, (that is, enjoining duty, forbidding &s;in, threat|ning, and condemning the guilty, acquitting the inno|cent) it appears to me that they are a great objection, and even a full confutation of the &s;en&s;e here given of the text. The de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle is to prove that the Gentiles who have not the law are a law to them|&s;elves. And the medium, or argument by which he proves it is their doing by nature the things of the law. Now it is a maxim in logic that the medium by which any thing is proved, mu&s;t be different from that which is proved by it; different in &s;en&s;e, as well as in terms; otherwi&s;e the argument will be trifling, merely proving a thing by it&s;elf. For in&s;tance, it would be trifling for any one to argue in this manner.
<Q>Since the Gentiles who have not the law are a law to them&s;elves, therefore the&s;e not having the law are a law to them&s;elves.</Q>
Now to &s;ay that a man does the <HI>offices</HI> of the law to him&s;elf, is &s;aying no more nor le&s;s than that he is a law to him&s;elf. We are in no other &s;en&s;e a law to our&s;elves, than that we do the offices of the law. If this then be what is intend|ed by the Gentiles doing the things of the law, I think
<PB N="136" REF="012416_0140_0F8974A1332016C8">
the apo&s;tles antecedent and con&s;equence differ only in terms; and the argument in the text mu&s;t am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unt to no more than this,
<Q>When the Gentiles who have not the law do by nature the offices of the law to them&s;elves, the&s;e having not the law, are a law, that is, do the offices of a law to them&s;elves!</Q>
Surely St. Paul did not argue at this rate. But if the &s;en&s;e be as our tran&s;lators have rendred, <HI>do|ing the things contained in the law,</HI> the argument is clear and pertinent. Mens doing the things required in the law without any knowledge of the written law, is an evidence that they are in&s;tead of a law to them|&s;elves, and that they have the work of the law writ|ten on their hearts.</P>
<P N="2">2. I humbly conceive, that the original word (poie) here u&s;ed is not proper to expre&s;s the elicit or imma|nent acts of the mind and con&s;cience, by which alone men are, or do the offices of a law to them&s;elves. It properly &s;ignifies to perform &s;ome action. <HI>Ari|&s;totle</HI> u&s;es it to expre&s;s the doing of what are called actions or performances, in di&s;tinction from the im|manent acts of the &s;oul. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ethic. lib. 6.</NOTE> And I think the word is commonly, if not always u&s;ed in this &s;en&s;e in the new te&s;tament. When the con&s;cience of men does the office of a law, this cannot properly be called (poie&s;is) a doing or performance. But to do the things con|tained in or injoined by the law is properly expre&s;&s;ed by the word here u&s;ed. It often bears this &s;en&s;e in the new te&s;tament, particularly in the ver&s;e immediately preceding this under con&s;ideration, the doers (poietai) of the law unque&s;tionably means the doers of the duties contained in the law. And it ought not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, without evident rea&s;on, that the apo&s;tle &s;hould immediately u&s;e the &s;ame word in effect to expre&s;s a meaning intirely diver&s;e.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="137" REF="012416_0141_0F8974A1F9410F08">3. The following ver&s;e &s;eems much to confirm the interpretation we plead for. "The gentiles," &s;ays the apo&s;tle,
<Q><HI>&s;hew</HI> the work of the law written in their hearts.</Q>
How do they &s;hew it? By tho&s;e actions, no doubt, which he had ju&s;t mentioned, viz. doing the things contained in the law. Or to u&s;e Dr. Owen's words,
<Q>They do many things which it requireth, and forbear or refrain from many things which it forbiddeth, and <HI>&s;o &s;hew forth</HI> it's work and efficacy.</Q>
They &s;hew it as believers do their faith, that is by their works. But &s;uch actions as bear no conformity to the impre&s;&s;ion of the law on mens hearts, do not &s;hew or evidence &s;uch an im|pre&s;&s;ion. And inward acts of mens minds are not vi&s;ible.</P>
<P N="4">4. The &s;tream of expo&s;itors runs the &s;ame way. All our engli&s;h expo&s;itors and divines (except Mr. Glas, from whom I took the objection here con&s;ider|ed) &s;o far as I have yet found, follow our tran&s;lation.

I &s;hall only add, that in the Syriac, which is account|ed the mo&s;t ancient and valuable of all the old ver|&s;ions, this ver&s;e is rendred, according to the &s;en&s;e we plead for, as appears by the tran&s;lation of it in the polyglot bible. It &s;eems that this &s;en&s;e of the apo|&s;tle's words which we oppo&s;e was unknown in the ancient church. Mr. H. will perhaps think I have been <HI>very wickedly</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pag. 90.</NOTE> employed, in producing the &s;uffrage of the learned re&s;pecting the &s;en&s;e of a text.

<P>This exception, being I hope removed, and the true meaning of the text vindicated, our argument from it in &s;upport of the point we have undertaken to defend, is now left to the con&s;ideration of all im|partial enquirers after truth. To me, I confe&s;s, the text &s;peaks as home to the point as can be de&s;ired.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The words of the evangeli&s;t, Mark vi. 20. will furni&s;h us with another proof of the doctrine we plead for.
<Q>Herod feared John, knowing that he was a ju&s;t man and a holy, and ob&s;erved him, and when he heard him he did many things, and heard him gladly.</Q>
Herod an unregenerate man, not only had a reverence for John Bapti&s;t as a righteous man, and heard him gladly, but he did many things which John taught and exhorted him to do. The &s;ame things that he heard he did. None can be &s;o wild as to imagine the meaning to be, that Herod did many things contrary to what he was taught; or merely that he was bu&s;y in doing &s;omething.
<Q>He
<PB N="139" REF="012416_0143_0F8974A45FD283D0">
was not only a hearer of the word, but in part a doer of the work.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Henry.</NOTE>
<Q>Herod did many things which John in preaching moved him unto.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</NOTE> Now John being full of the Holy Gho&s;t, taught and ex|horted his hearers to do nothing but what was their duty. If then Herod did any thing that John ex|horted him to do (the text &s;ays he did many things) then John exhorted to &s;uch duties as may be done by an unregenerate &s;inner. Mr. H. indeed tells us that
<Q>John &s;aid not a word of unregenerate duties, but preached and inculcated nothing &s;hort of true repentance.</Q>
P. 148. But St. <HI>Mark,</HI> who was more likely to know, informs us that he preached &s;uch duties as Herod practi&s;ed. And we may now fairly return him his own compliment;
<Q>Mr. H. and they who join with him are wi&s;er than John the Bapti&s;t; and if he was wi&s;e and right in his preaching they are not &s;o.</Q>
Ibid.</P>
<P N="5">V. Another argument I &s;hall take from Phil. iv. 8.
<Q>Finally my brethren, what&s;oever things are true, what&s;oever things are hone&s;t, what&s;oever things are ju&s;t, what&s;oever things are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what&s;oever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any prai&s;e, think on the&s;e things.</Q>
It will perhaps be thought that this text is not &s;o pertinently cited in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, being addre&s;&s;ed to profe&s;&s;ed believers who for ought that I know were all regenerate. I have not cited it becau&s;e &s;traitned for proofs, but for a particular rea&s;on, which will pre&s;ently appear.</P>
<P>Two things are to be enquired into for the opening this text, and our argument grounded upon it: viz. Whether the hearers of the go&s;pel in general are bound by this precept to an immediate attendance to the duties here enjoined? And whether the duties
<PB N="140" REF="012416_0144_0F8974A4F117DF00">
are of &s;uch a nature, that an unregenerate &s;inner is able to perform any thing of what is here inculcated? For the fir&s;t Mr. H. has happily &s;aved us the trouble of proving it; he having granted as fully, and more fully than we de&s;ire, that the exhortations to duty which in &s;cripture are addre&s;&s;ed to the regenerate, bind the unregenerate to obedience, as much as if they had been particularly directed to them.</P>
<P>All that is wanting then in order to form a &s;olid argument to our purpo&s;e from this text, is to &s;hew that the unregenerate have a next power to practi&s;e the&s;e duties; that is, to &s;peak the truth, to behave ju&s;tly, temperately, amiably, and in a word, practi&s;e tho&s;e virtues which are of general good report. Now the&s;e things are &s;o manife&s;tly in the power of the un|regenerate, that no one I think will deny it on any other pretence than this; that the apo&s;tle means only &s;uch a practice of the&s;e virtues as implies or pre&s;up|po&s;es a principle of true holine&s;s infu&s;ed in regene|ration.</P>
<P>Now though it be true that men ought to do all the&s;e things in the exerci&s;e of faith and love, and that the want of holy principles and ends is an e&s;&s;ential defect in the mo&s;t &s;hining virtues; yet it is carefully to be ob&s;erved, that it is not a principle of grace that con&s;titutes or denominates mens behaviour true, ho|ne&s;t, &amp;c. in the common acceptation of the words. Though a man cannot live in a <HI>holy</HI> manner while unregenerate, yet he can live <HI>ju&s;tly, temperately,</HI> and &s;peak the <HI>truth.</HI> It is the &s;ub&s;tance and matter of actions, not their flowing from &s;upernatural princi|ples, that con&s;titutes them ju&s;t, laudable, and of ge|neral good report. A man may &s;peak the truth, and deal hone&s;tly and behave temperatel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and the like, without the grace of regeneration. And the&s;e things are the duty of the unrege<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erate by virtue of this
<PB N="141" REF="012416_0145_0F8974A5B3602D08">
precept. For <HI>what&s;oever</HI> things are true, &amp;c. are &s;trictly enjoined. And it is a beggarly pretence, de|&s;titute of any proof from &s;cripture or rea&s;on, to &s;ay that there is no obligation on any one to &s;peak the truth, and practi&s;e the other virtues here recommend|ed, except on &s;uppo&s;ition of it's being done from a holy principle.</P>
<P>It is not to be allowed to any arbitrarily to &s;up|po&s;e, that when only the &s;ub&s;tance and matter of a duty is expre&s;ly enjoined in a &s;cripture precept, there is no obligation on any to do what is enjoined, un|le&s;s the performance be every way qualified as it ought to be. To omit any requi&s;ite circum&s;tances of a duty is a &s;in, but to omit the &s;ub&s;tance of the duty al&s;o is a double &s;in. Lying and inju&s;tice are in them&s;elves &s;ins ab&s;tract from all circum&s;tances. Con&s;equently truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s are in them&s;elves commanded duties. It is not to be allowed to any arbitrarily to &s;uppo&s;e, that when the apo&s;tle urges a regard to <HI>what&s;oever</HI> things are true without limi|tation, he means not to exhort men to regard truth, unle&s;s on certain &s;uppo&s;itions, and with the conjuncti|on of &s;uch circum&s;tances, as are not nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ti|tute the virtue of truth, according to the common acceptation of the word, however nece&s;&s;ary they may be to con&s;titute an action &s;piritually good. The &s;crip|tures are to be taken according to the common mean|ing of the words and phra&s;es therein u&s;ed, unle&s;s &s;ome weighty rea&s;on appear for a &s;ingular and appropriate &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The practice of moral virtues in men unregenerate is in it's kind good, lovely, laudable. It was on this account that God loved Cyrus. I&s;ai. 48.14.
<Q>God loved Cyrus,</Q>
&s;ays Mr. Pool,
<Q>with that parti|cular kind of love which God hath for &s;uch men as excel others in any virtues, as Cyrus did. In
<PB N="142" REF="012416_0146_0F8974A671265238">
which &s;en&s;e Chri&s;t loved the young man.</Q>
Mark 10.21.
<Q>Then Je&s;us beholding him loved him, Not with a &s;pecial and &s;aving love,</Q>
(&s;ays Dr. Collins, Mr. Pool's continuator)
<Q>but he loved him with &s;uch a common love as he loveth all his crea|tures with, and e&s;pecially &s;uch as are better than others. All that can be concluded from hence is, that acts of moral righteou&s;ne&s;s are plea&s;ing to God.</Q>
It was on account of &s;uch virtues as the apo|&s;tle recommends that Je&s;us loved this young ruler. It was not merely love of benevolence that is here chief|ly intended; much le&s;s pity to him as one peculiarly &s;tupid and hardned in pride and enmity again&s;t God. The phari&s;ees were as proper objects of pity on this account as any; while maliciou&s;ly watching for &s;ome|thing to accu&s;e him. But we do not read that be|holding them he loved them, but
<Q>he looked round with anger being grieved at the hardne&s;s of their hearts.</Q>
His love to this per&s;on is commonly under&s;tood to have been a friendly complacency in him, on account of his amiable character and be|haviour. In this young man we have a proof and ex|ample that a virtuous behaviour is amiable even in the unregenerate. Mr. H. indeed gives a different account of this matter. "Nor is there any rea&s;on," &s;ays he,
<Q>to think that Chri&s;t loved him on account of any thing amiable in his character. He "be|holding him," looking on him as a poor, ignorant, &s;tupid, proud enemy to God, and in a mo&s;t wretch|ed condition, this excited in him the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve of pity and benevolence to him. This I &s;uppo&s;e is all that is meant by his loving him</Q>
P. 82. What "the happy people who &s;hall live in the la&s;t days" (to whom Mr. H. makes his appeal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 54.</NOTE>) may think of this glo&s;s, I &s;hall not pretend to divine. Tho&s;e who
<PB N="143" REF="012416_0147_0F8974A7322F84D8">
live in the&s;e degenerare times, for what I can yet find, are very generally of opinion that it is neither ju&s;t, nor even hand&s;omely probable. I &s;hall not how|ever &s;top to object to it, but return to the point in hand, from which we had almo&s;t digre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Whenever any external duty is enjoined in &s;crip|ture, without any limitation of the performance to qualified &s;ubjects, or involving the <HI>circum&s;tances</HI> of the external <HI>action</HI> into the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> of the <HI>duty</HI> (as is the ca&s;e in bapti&s;m, the Lord's &s;upper, &amp;c.) There is then a general obligation to perform the &s;ub&s;tance of the duty, though it &s;hould be defective in it's cir|cum&s;tances. Thus external moral duties are imme|diately and in them&s;elves enjoined on all, whether re|generate or not. Thus when the I&s;raelites were com|manded to keep the pa&s;&s;over, it was their duty to do it, and in &s;o doing
<Q>they did as the Lord command|ed Mo&s;es and Aaron.</Q>
(Exod. xii. 28.) Though we have no rea&s;on to think that the body of the peo|ple kept it in a holy manner. When Paul in his voyage to Italy exhorted tho&s;e who &s;ailed with him to take &s;ome meat, becau&s;e it would be for their health; though it was their duty in eating to aim &s;incerely at the glory of God, which as unregenerate many of them were not in a next capacity to do; yet if any one &s;hould &s;ay, that the apo&s;tle did not mean to invite any to eat while unregenerate, and con&s;e|quently, that none of this character did any thing that he invited them to do, but directly contrary, when they took &s;ome meat; mu&s;t we not conclude that &s;uch a one had confounded him&s;elf, and the plain &s;en&s;e of the &s;cripture, with fooli&s;h &s;ubtilties? Com|mon &s;en&s;e would conclude, that what Paul invited them to do, and what the hi&s;torian &s;ays they did, was no more nor le&s;s than the natural action of eating &s;imply con&s;idered; an action which neither includes,
<PB N="144" REF="012416_0148_0F8974A7F0DA06F8">
nor excludes the exerci&s;e of a holy principle; and that there is no more difficulty in &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;uch kind of actions may be enjoined by God, for wi&s;e and good ends; than that they may lawfully be advi&s;ed to by a good man. God has a right indeed to re|quire the doing of tho&s;e things, which without a &s;pecial direction from him it would not be lawful for any man to order or advi&s;e. But who will imagine that men may lawfully advi&s;e to the doing of that, which would be incon&s;i&s;tent with the holine&s;s of God to require? But of this more in the next &s;ection. To &s;um up the matter, when the apo&s;tle in this text exhorts to the practice of moral duties, and when in other parts of the new te&s;tament men are called to an attendance on the outward means of conver&s;ion, is the duty of all tho&s;e who hear the call of the go&s;pel to perform the&s;e duties as to the &s;ub&s;tance, whether they are in an immediate capacity to perform them in a holy manner or not. That is, it is their duty to do that which an unrege|nerate &s;inner is able to do; which was to be proved. And this is what is meant by tho&s;e who &s;ay that God requires both the performance and the goodne&s;s of the duty. Nor is the di&s;tinction here &s;ugge&s;ted, either "<HI>new</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Works who&s;e <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> doth not cleave nece&s;&s;arily to the <HI>doing of them,</HI> but to the <HI>manner</HI> of doing them wicked men may perform.</Q>

<P><PB N="145" REF="012416_0149_0F8974A8B60D5F30">It is a vain and groundle&s;s &s;ugge&s;tion, that the a|po&s;tles did not exhort to any thing as matter of duty which the unregenerate are able to perform. To correct this mi&s;take which has been too confidently maintained by &s;ome, was my principal de&s;ign in di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing this text. The apo&s;tles often inculcate ex|ternal duties which the unregenerate are able to per|form as to the &s;ub&s;tance of them. And &s;uch pre|cepts oblige the hearers of the go&s;pel in general to &s;uch a performance of them as they are capable of, whether regenerate or not; and are to be indi&s;cri|minately inculcated on all, to &s;tir them up to endea|vours of obedience.

But what warrant have we from &s;cripture to &s;ay to men, "If ye are regenerate and true believers, then ye may and ought to &s;peak the truth one to another, to be ju&s;t in your dealings, to be temperate and cha&s;te in your behaviour, to read and hear God's word, and pray to him: Otherwi&s;e, and without the&s;e qualifications, the&s;e things are not your duty, nor required at your hands; and all en|deavours to do any of the&s;e things while unregene|rate, are as unwarrantable and pre&s;umptuous, as for an infidel to receive the outward &s;eals of the cove|nant." Let any precept or authentic precedent for &s;uch a manner of preaching be produced, and it &s;hall be attended to. In the mean time; we have a war|rant to urge an attendance to the precepts of the go&s;pel, without foi&s;ting in any limitations or conditi|ons not contained in tho&s;e precepts. We have a

<P N="6">VI. Another argument may be taken from divers te&s;timonies from the old te&s;tament, manife&s;ting God's approbation or favourable notice of the actions of un|&s;anctified men, when for the &s;ub&s;tance conformable to his will; and his rewarding them with temporal ble&s;&s;ings, becau&s;e or on account of them. Thus Jeremiah was &s;ent with this me&s;&s;age to the Jews, chap. 34.15. "Ye were now turned, and had done right in my &s;ight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour"; though they &s;oon after fell from it. 2 Chron. 25.2, 3, 4. "Amaziah did that which was right in the &s;ight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart." And particularly, in puni&s;hing his father's murderers, he "did as it is written in the law in the book of Mo&s;es." And of his father Joa&s;h it is &s;aid, chap. 24.2. that "he did that which was right in the &s;ight of the Lord all the days of Jehoia|da"; though afterward he fell to idolatry, and put to death the prie&s;t who reproved him for it. 2 Kin. 10.30. "The Lord &s;aid unto Jehu, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t done well, in executing that which was right in mine eyes,&mdash;thy children of the fourth generation &s;hall &s;it on the throne of I&s;rael. But Jehu took no
<PB N="147" REF="012416_0151_0F8974AB0F162308">
heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of I&s;rael with all his heart." 2 Chron. 11.4. "Rehoboam, and the people obeyed the words of the Lord, and returned from going again&s;t Jeroboam." And af|terwards when he and all I&s;rael were puni&s;hed for for&s;aking the law of the Lord, yet when they hum|bled them&s;elves, "the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, &s;aying, they have humbled them&s;elves, <HI>therefore</HI> I will not de&s;troy them, but I will grant them &s;ome deliverance," chap. 12.7. Ahab's humi|liation was favourably noticed by God. "Becau&s;e he humbleth him&s;elf," (&s;aith God) "I will not bring the evil in his days." 1 Kings 21.25&mdash;29. So was the repentance and reformation of the Ninevites. Jonah 3&mdash;10. "God &s;aw their works, that they turned from their evil ways, and God repented of the evil that he &s;aid he would do unto them, and he did it not." And this in&s;tance is mentioned by our Sa|viour, as what would in the day of judgment con|demn the impenitent Jews. Other in&s;tances there are which I &s;tay not to collect.</P>
<P>It appears from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages that unregenerate &s;inners have done that which was in &s;ome re&s;pect <HI>right in God's &s;ight:</HI> Of which he has <HI>expre&s;&s;ed his approbation:</HI> Which was <HI>commanded in his law:</HI> Which he calls <HI>obeying his word: Becau&s;e,</HI> or on ac|count, of which he has <HI>averted threatned judgments, &s;u&s;pended puni&s;hments, granted temporal ble&s;&s;ings</HI>; even &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings as imply the <HI>continuance of &s;piri|tual privileges.</HI> Now the&s;e things cannot be &s;aid of any actions, which it was not the duty of &s;uch per|&s;ons to do. And if the unregenerate have done what was their duty in any in&s;tances, there is &s;till a power in the unregenerate to do &s;ome things which are their duty: And conver&s;ely &s;ome things are their duty, for the doing of which they have a power.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="012416_0152_0F8974ABB2D6F808">Mr. H. labours in the fire to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the&s;e plain te&s;timonies, which &s;peak &s;o fully and ex|pre&s;ly in oppo&s;ition to his cau&s;e.

<P>As to the fir&s;t part of his reply, we will fir&s;t review the evidence which the&s;e texts give to the points by him objected to; and then examine his objections.</P>
<P>The &s;criptures declare in expre&s;s words that per|&s;ons allowed to be unregenerate, did that which was right in God's &s;ight: According as it is written in the divine law: That they obeyed the words of the Lord: And that temporal favours were promi&s;ed and granted, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> of their doing the&s;e things.

Mr. H. has however ventured to do it with
<PB N="149" REF="012416_0153_0F8974AC71A10C30">
much confidence. And though I &s;hall upon the au|thority of the &s;criptures hold the&s;e things for unde|niable facts, and have a right to repel every objection that rea&s;on may pre&s;ume to offer again&s;t them; yet let us hear what is objected.</P>
<P>Says he,
<Q>If God granted favours to Ahab and Jehu, and a great deliverance to the Ninevites, <HI>purely</HI> out of re&s;pect to their repentance and good deeds, while they were impenitent, &amp;c. then he may and does &s;hew favour to &s;inners out of re&s;pect to what they are in them&s;elves, their exerci&s;es and doings, and without any re&s;pect and relation to Chri&s;t the mediator. Therefore if there was no &s;uch mediator, he might &s;hew favours to &s;inners, take a favourable notice of their doings, and expre&s;s, &amp;c. his approbation of them; and <HI>purely</HI> out of re&s;pect to this &s;u&s;pend his puni&s;hments, and grant them pardon and &s;alvation. For if he grants a le&s;s good&mdash;out of re&s;pect to their character and do|ings, becau&s;e they have done well,&mdash;he may as well grant a greater good, even pardon of &s;in and eternal &s;alvation out of re&s;pect to this.&mdash;What need then&mdash;of a mediator in order to obtain&mdash; the favour of God!</Q>
And thus he concludes,
<Q>the whole go&s;pel is overthrown, and Chri&s;t is repre|&s;ented as dying in vain.</Q>

<P>It is here to be ob&s;erved, that Mr. H. to give his con&s;equences the better colour, has foi&s;ted in the word [purely] into the antecedent, implying that his an|tagoni&s;t meant to a&s;&s;ert,

What chri&s;tian then &s;hall dare &s;ugge&s;t, that if God has done that which his word abundantly a&s;&s;ures us he has in fact done, then the go&s;pel is overthrown, and Chri&s;t has died in vain.

<P>He mu&s;t not (while he allows the truth of the &s;crip|tures) deny that God granted favours to Ahab and Jehu, and a great deliverance to the Ninevites, what|ever were the ground or rea&s;on of it.

<P>If he &s;hall &s;ay that God grants favours to &s;inners through Chri&s;t's mediation, takes a favourable notice,

and expre&s;&s;es his approbation of their doings; and if this be not &s;ubver&s;ive of the go&s;pel; then neither is our argument: Unle&s;s it be incon&s;i&s;tent to &s;uppo&s;e that a favour may be granted to men becau&s;e of their doings, and al&s;o out of re&s;pect to Chri&s;t's mediation. But this cannot be &s;aid, unle&s;s we will be &s;o profane as to &s;ay, that facts expre&s;ly recorded in the &s;criptures are &s;ubver&s;ive of the go&s;pel.

<P>If he &s;hall &s;ay that the&s;e temporal favours, and the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of divine approbation, are not grant|ed out of re&s;pect to Chri&s;t; then his argument will, if it prove any thing, convict him&s;elf of overthrowing the go&s;pel.

He concluded that a mitigation and &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of puni&s;hment mu&s;t be allowed to be con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice; and &s;o argued as Mr. H. has done, that on this &s;uppo&s;ition, ju&s;tice does not ab&s;olutely and nece&s;&s;arily require that &s;in &s;hould be puni&s;hed at all. The learned may find this argument an&s;wered, in Dr. <HI>Owen</HI>'s latin <HI>Diatribe de ju&s;titia divina,</HI> and in <HI>Turretine</HI>'s di&s;putations <HI>de nece&s;&s;itate &s;atisfactionis Chri&s;ti</HI>; who have &s;hewn, that ju&s;tice admits of a latitude and variety of di&s;pen&s;a|tion in the puni&s;hment of &s;in: That various manners, circum|&s;tances, and degrees of puni&s;hing a &s;in, are alike con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice; and con&s;equently, the&s;e things are determined not by ju&s;tice, but by a wi&s;e and holy &s;overeignty. If the author's con|&s;equences are ju&s;t, I &s;ee not but that the <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> nece&s;&s;ity of the atonement a priori mu&s;t be given up; which I would how|ever be loth to call a &s;ubver&s;ion of the go&s;pel, when I find &s;uch great and good divines as Augu&s;tine, Calvin, Mu&s;culus, Twi&s;&s;e, Vo&s;&s;ius, Goodwin, Norton, Stoddar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Rutherford, &amp;c. did not hold to it. I &s;uppo&s;e it will not be thought by any that Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion and mitigation of puni&s;hment for the devils. And yet it is certain that the full degree of puni&s;hment to which they are condemned is not at pre&s;ent in|flicted on them. They are re&s;erved in chains under dark|ne&s;s, like pri&s;oners, to the judgment of the great day; to which there is a plain reference in their be&s;eeching and adju|ring Chri&s;t not to torment them <HI>before the time.</HI> Now if our author's argument be valid, we may as well argue in the follow|ing manner. If the puni&s;hment of the devils may be mitigated and &s;u&s;pended for a time, without any atonement for their &s;in; it may be mitigated to the utmo&s;t &s;uppo&s;able degree, and for the longe&s;t &s;uppo&s;able duration; con&s;equently the puni&s;h|ment of &s;in may be perfectly remitted, and that forever. What need is there then of an atonement, when the &s;inner may have a full and everla&s;ting reprieve, equivalent to a pardon without it? The truth is, it belongs not to us to limit the prerogative of the Deity. And they who are &s;o ra&s;h as to pretend to do it by rea&s;onings <HI>a priori,</HI> will find that they meddle with things too high for them.</NOTE></P>

<P N="2">2. This hypothe&s;is affords no relief again&s;t any of tho&s;e ab&s;urdities with which he &s;uppo&s;es our inter|pretation of the&s;e texts to be pre&s;&s;ed. The very &s;ame objections lie equally again&s;t the <HI>principle</HI> on which he proceeds in his expo&s;ition. For I a&s;k, how is it, according to Mr. H's rea&s;oning, con&s;i&s;tent with the divine purity, and the nece&s;&s;ity of an atonement for &s;in, for God to &s;peak of, and conduct towards men, as if their character and behaviour was right and ac|ceptable to him; having re&s;pect only to their exter|nal conduct, without &s;earching their hearts. The di|vine conduct herein is either on account of Chri&s;t's mediation, or it is not. If not, then in ca&s;e there had been no mediator or atonement, God might have &s;poken of, and conducted towards &s;inners, as if their actions were right in his &s;ight. He might have taken a favourable notice of their external &s;hews of repen|tance and reformation. He might have expre&s;&s;ed his approbation of them as right in his &s;ight. He might have averted temporal judgments, &s;u&s;pended puni&s;h|ments, promi&s;ed and granted temporal ble&s;&s;ings, <HI>purely</HI> becau&s;e of, or out of re&s;pect to mens vi&s;ible character, without acting as the &s;earcher of hearts. Not only &s;o, but he might, without &s;earching mens hearts, have forgiven their &s;ins, promi&s;ed and be&s;towed eternal life, having re&s;pect only to their outward behaviour. And thus there would be no nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t's dy|ing to purcha&s;e the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings for us, which might all be conferred by God on &s;inners, acting herein not as the &s;earcher of hearts, but having re&s;pect only to what is vi&s;ible, to their external conduct and beha|viour.</P>
<P>But if it be &s;aid, that it is only on account of Chri&s;t's mediation that God can con&s;i&s;tently with his righte|ou&s;ne&s;s

Which is a diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rent point from that which is the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent debate, viz. that &s;ome actions of the unregenerate are commanded duties. Mr. H. denies both: And though his direct de&s;ign be to an|&s;wer Mr. Mills's argument, yet he has &s;haped &s;uch an an&s;wer as, if it concludes any thing to his purpo&s;e, will conclude equal|ly again&s;t both the&s;e points; and indeed more directly again&s;t the latter than the former. For he contends, that if God has expre&s;&s;ed his approbation and favorable notice of any actions of the unregenerate, promi&s;ed and granted temporal ble&s;&s;ings (purely) becau&s;e of them, then Chri&s;t is dead in vain. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary for us to con&s;ider this argument, &s;o far as it is pointed again&s;t ours.

It is the principle on which both arguments are founded that he objects to, and I defend. But indeed the di&s;pen&s;ing of tem|poral ble&s;&s;ings, according to the <HI>real</HI> characters of men, com|pared with one another, as viewed by the &s;earcher of hearts; and becau&s;e of their being comparatively better, is no more in|con&s;i&s;tent with the nece&s;&s;ity of an atonement, than di&s;pen&s;ing the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ings according to their vi&s;ible character, and becau&s;e they have in &s;ome in&s;tances behaved aright. I am far from thinking that men are in this world treated according to their real comparative character, or indeed always according to their external conduct. But if it were &s;uppo&s;ed, it could not be &s;hewn to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine puri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, or the nece&s;&s;ity of an atonement.</NOTE></P>

If any one has ground to hope his endeavours will be for his advantage, he has then encouragement to en|deavours.</P>

by a compliance with them, there is then an encou|ragement or ground of hope annexed to them. Pro|mi&s;es are encouragements: But there may be encou|ragements which are not promi&s;es: There may be other rea&s;ons of hope. A divine promi&s;e is a ground of &s;ure hope: But if there be only a probable rea&s;on to hope for &s;ome good, there is then a lower encou|ragement. There are &s;ome encouragements for &s;in|ners to hope for &s;alvation which are not connected with any of their endeavours; &s;uch as the divine goodne&s;s, the al-&s;ufficient atonement, the ab&s;olute promi&s;es of mercy. There are other encouragements or rea&s;ons of hope to &s;inners, if they attend on the means of grace; that is, the greater probability of obtaining &s;alvation in this way. It is on the&s;e our argument is grounded.</P>
<P>This may &s;uffice to &s;hew what we mean by en|couragement. It is &s;imply a rea&s;on of hope. The other &s;en&s;e mentioned by our author <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">pag 137.</NOTE> &s;eems to be a mi&s;take. Exhortations are often enforced with en|couragements. But exhortations are properly as di&s;tinct from annexed encouragements, as commands are from annexed rea&s;ons. Be this as it may, it is in this &s;en&s;e we &s;ay, and he acknowledges, that God en|courages the unregenerate to attend on the means of grace. "Sometimes," &s;ays he,
<Q>encouragement means that which gives a hope and pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s in any bu&s;ine&s;s and pur&s;uit.&mdash;In this &s;en&s;e God encourages &s;inners, let their hearts be as &s;inful and oppo&s;ite to him as they will, to attend the means of grace.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">ibid.</NOTE></P>
<P>The manner in which God encourages human en|deavours is various. Sometimes by promi&s;ing &s;uc|ce&s;s; &s;ometimes by &s;ignifying in his word that there is &s;ome probability our labour may not be in vain.
<PB N="159" REF="012416_0163_0F8974B4B5085310">
Thus the apo&s;tle encourages mini&s;ters to in&s;truct oppo&s;ers in meekne&s;s, if peradventure God will give them repentance. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 2.25</NOTE> And God having commanded Jeremiah to write the words he had &s;poken, adds this encouragement to the command.
<Q>It may be that the hou&s;e of Judah will hear all the evil that I pur|po&s;e to do to them, that they may return every man from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquity.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. 36.3.</NOTE> And there are exhortations to refor|mation, which &s;eem to be enforced with this lower degree of encouragement. Daniel exhorted king Nebuchadnezzar to break off his &s;ins by righteou&s;ne&s;s, and his iniquity by &s;hewing mercy to the poor, if it might be a lengthening out of his tranquility. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dan. 4 27.</NOTE> This form of exhortation is not unfrequent in &s;cripture. The words of Peter to Simon of Samaria are perhaps a parallel in&s;tance to that la&s;t quoted. "Repent of this thy wickedne&s;s, and pray to God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee." <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts 8.22.</NOTE> God al&s;o encourages human endeavours <HI>by examples of &s;ucce&s;s</HI> recorded in his word. The proficiency David made in &s;piritual knowledge by &s;tudying God's word is an encouragement to us to do as he did. The &s;ame is &s;ugge&s;ted from the happy fruits of the Bereans &s;earching the &s;criptures daily. The numerous ex|amples recorded in &s;cripture of &s;inners converted, and &s;aints edified by the preaching of the go&s;pel, encou|rage an attendance to this ordinance. The in&s;tances of God's hearing the prayer of &s;aints and &s;inners are a general encouragement to this duty. The mercy of God to &s;inners on their humbling them&s;elves, and for&s;aking their evil cour&s;es, is an encouragement to repentance and reformation. Again God encourages our endeavours <HI>when he &s;hews us by our own ob&s;erva|tion, that they are commonly &s;ucce&s;sful:</HI> And finally
<PB N="160" REF="012416_0164_0F8974B5721AC070">
<HI>when according to the laws of nature they operate as cau&s;es or means of advantage to us.</HI> Thus men are encouraged to apply them&s;elves diligently to the bu|&s;ine&s;s of their lawful calling, becau&s;e &s;uch endeavours are naturally conducive to the end at which they aim.</P>
<P>But is &s;eems to be a matter of no great importance in what manner God gives us a ground of hope that our endeavours will probably be of advantage to us. If the encouragement be real, and not a fond pre|&s;umption, it is a ju&s;t rea&s;on of action laid before us by God, to excite us to it. If we have good evidence that a particular action is our duty, it matters not how we obtained it, whether by the natural light and rea|&s;on of our own minds, or by &s;upernatural in&s;truction We are by the authority of God bound to do it. So if we have a ju&s;t ground of hope that our doing a particular action will be to our real good, this encou|ragement is a ju&s;t rea&s;on for acting propo&s;ed to us by God, to prompt us thereto, in whatever way it is propo&s;ed to us.</P>
<P>I now proceed to &s;hew, how it appears from God's encouraging men unregenerate to attend the means of grace, that this is their duty. God never encou|raged any one to do that which was not his duty. He never prompts men to do that which ought not to be done, and which is indeed nothing but &s;in, by giving them a ju&s;t and real ground of hope that it will be to their everla&s;ting benefit. This we are war|ranted to a&s;&s;ert, not only from the holine&s;s of his na|ture, but from the plain words of St. James. "Let no man &s;ay when he is tempted I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted of evil, neither tempteth he any man." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jam. 1.13.</NOTE> There are two &s;en&s;es in which men are &s;aid to be tempted. 1. For the trial or di&s;covery of what is in their hearts, whether they
<PB N="161" REF="012416_0165_0F8974B6339DB308">
will abide &s;tedfa&s;t in the practice of duty, when it will expo&s;e them to trouble, and interferes with their worldly intere&s;ts and enjoyments; or whether they will refrain from &s;in, when there is a pro&s;pect of a|voiding the troubles of this life, and obtaining tem|poral good things by the commi&s;&s;ion of it. In this &s;en&s;e God is &s;aid to tempt or prove men; by putting them in &s;uch circum&s;tances, that the practice of their duty &s;hall co&s;t them much &s;elf-denial, and the ad|vantages of worldly riches honours and plea&s;ures, &s;hall be apparently on the &s;ide of &s;in; and by per|mitting &s;atan and wicked men to repre&s;ent the&s;e al|lurements in a &s;trong light to the mind, to intice and deceive it into a compliance, or otherwi&s;e &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch thoughts as tend to &s;in. All this may ea&s;ily be re|conciled to the divine purity; &s;ince there is no real encouragement given, no ju&s;t ground of hope, that a con&s;ent to the temptation will be of advantage to us in the end. The command of God, with the high &s;anctions enforcing obedience, are motives infinitely &s;tronger in them&s;elves, than can ever be urged in any temptation. 2. There is another &s;en&s;e in which men are &s;aid to be tempted, viz. when inducements or motives to &s;in are &s;et before them on purpo&s;e to per|&s;uade them to it. Whoever thus tempts any one, really aims to per&s;uade him to a compliance, and not to prove his integrity. Such a one will accordingly endeavour to propo&s;e &s;uch inducements as will be mo&s;t likely to prevail, and effect the de&s;ign he has in view. In this &s;en&s;e we are tempted by &s;atan and wicked men; but let no man &s;ay or think in his heart that he is thus tempted to &s;in by the holy God. He may put it to our choice whether we will chu&s;e af|fliction with the people of God, rather than enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea&s;on: But at the &s;ame time he propo&s;es a recompence of reward, to encourage us to
<PB N="162" REF="012416_0166_0F8974B6F226A368">
a firm adherence to our duty; and lets us know that bitterne&s;s and poi&s;on are mingled in the cup that &s;o|licits our appetite. If God gives men a real and ju&s;t rea&s;on to hope that their attending the means of grace will be for their everla&s;ting advantage; it
<Q>he has &s;o ordered things that this is the mo&s;t likely way to e&s;cape the greate&s;t evil, and be happy forever,</Q>
and he "lets men know" it, as our author owns; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 137.</NOTE> then either what God encourages them to do is their duty, or what they ought to do; or el&s;e he lays before them I m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t powerful inducement to &s;in: And that not to prove their integrity, but to per&s;uade them to do that which is in it&s;elf mere &s;in. Mr. H. mu&s;t on his own principle own that God encourages the unregenerate to &s;in: That he lets them know that their doing what they ought not to do will probably be for their eternal intere&s;t; that &s;o men might have a ju&s;t and real (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot a deceitful) rea&s;on of hope to move them to the commi&s;&s;ion of it. But mu&s;t we not then &s;ay that this would be tempting men to evil? Laying before them &s;o &s;trong an inducement, as mu&s;t and will prevail it duly apprehended and weighed? And to give the greater efficacy to the inducement, or &s;hall I call it temptation, the operation of the holy Spirit goes with it, to &s;et it home on the heart. The&s;e things &s;eem almo&s;t too &s;hocking to be mentioned. May any chri&s;tian admit the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the di|vine being has &s;o ordered and con&s;tituted things, that any one &s;hould have <HI>a rea&s;onable inducement, a real encouragement</HI> to an action, the doing of which is not his duty but utterly and totally &s;inful? God forbid. If he has &s;o ordered things that an attendance on the means of grace is the mo&s;t likely way to e&s;cape eter|nal mi&s;ery and be happy forever; and if he has let &s;inners know it; this is as certain evidence that an
<PB N="163" REF="012416_0167_0F8974B7B05D39C0">
attendance on the means of grace is their duty, as the &s;anctions annexed to a divine command are that it is our duty to obey it.</P>
<P>This argument from encouragements Mr. H. &s;eems rather to de&s;pi&s;e, then endeavour directly to confute. Some things however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e has &s;aid, which he thinks, if con&s;idered, mu&s;t convince any one that "God may and does encourage his creatures to that in doing which they are utterly &s;inful." P 138. This may be taken in two &s;en&s;es. If he means, that the unre|generate are &s;inners for not doing w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they are en|couraged to in a holy manner; and that the action in the compound &s;en&s;e is unholy or &s;inful, as being defective in principle and end; this is nothing to the purpo&s;e of an&s;wering our argument. We allow and contend for all this. But we &s;ay, that when God en|courages the performance in it&s;elf, or in the divided &s;en&s;e, he does not encourage the &s;infulne&s;s of the a|gent, or the &s;inful defects or irregular circum&s;tances cleaving to the performance. The&s;e have no ten|dency to his advantage. It is the &s;ub&s;tance of the duty that is the means of good. It is this that God encourages to; and to this &s;inners ought to attend. It he means, that God encourages men to &s;uch actions <HI>the doing of which is &s;inful</HI>; (which it is incumbent on him to prove if he would an&s;wer our argument) I can &s;ee nothing, though I have con&s;idered what he has &s;aid, that makes this appear in the lea&s;t probable. That the reader may judge for him&s;elf, I will lay be|fore him in our author's words the &s;ub&s;tance of his reply.</P>
<P><Q>To encourage a per&s;on to any particular way of conduct is to let him know that this is the mo&s;t hopeful way to mi&s;s of the evil he dreads, and ob|tain what he &s;ets up as the object of his pur&s;uit, be that what it will.&mdash;In this &s;en&s;e God encourages

men, let their hearts be as &s;inful and oppo&s;ite to him as they will, to attend on the means of grace. He has &s;o ordered things, that this is the mo&s;t likely way to e&s;cape the greate&s;t evil, and be happy forever. So that when they come to view things in any mea&s;ure as they are, and are above all things afraid of eternal de&s;truction, and de&s;irous of future happine&s;s, they will be induced from a principle of &s;elf love or &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s even that very principle that &s;ets their hearts again&s;t God, and leads them into all the wickedne&s;s they practi&s;e, with great care and anxiety to attend on the&s;e means. The whole en|couragement as laid before them lies in it's being the mo&s;t hopeful way to promote their intere&s;t, and an&s;wer the end which they are pur&s;uing.</Q>
P. 137.</P>
<P>Here indeed &s;omething is a&s;&s;erted; but how it weakens our argument, or proves that men are en|couraged to that the doing of which is &s;in, I do not &s;ee: Unle&s;s the meaning be, "that God lets men know that attending the means of grace will proba|bly &s;ecure their happine&s;s, at the expence of his own glory, and the intere&s;t of the univer&s;e:" Which how wild and extravagant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;&s;ertion &s;oever it may &s;eem is really implied in his &s;cheme. For he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">les that &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is the only principle of action in the unre|generate: That this principle is in it's own nature enmity to being in general: That it is directly oppo|&s;ite to benevolence: That the end it propo&s;es is op|po&s;ite to the intere&s;t of being in general: That the unregenerate have no conception or de&s;ire of true happine&s;s. The&s;e things he inculcates abundantly. Now if we compare the&s;e things with what he has &s;aid about God's encouraging an attendance on means, this mu&s;t appear to be the &s;um of his doctrine, "Though the end which unregenerate &s;inners aim at be directly oppo&s;ite to the intere&s;t of being in general;
<PB N="165" REF="012416_0169_0F8974BA41D63318">
though the object they are pur&s;uing be not true hap|pine&s;s or &s;alvation; yet God has &s;o ordered things, that he lets them know that there is encouragement, or ground of hope, that by attending the means of grace they may obtain what they &s;et up as the object of their pur&s;uit; however oppo&s;ite to his own glory, to the good of being in general, and their own true happine&s;s. Though they are aiming at the wor&s;t end which can po&s;&s;ibly be imagined; and acting from a principle directly oppo&s;ite to benevolence, yet when they come to &s;ee things in any mea&s;ure as they are, they find <HI>a real ground of hope,</HI> that by attending on the means of grace they &s;hall carry their point. And this view of the ca&s;e being exactly &s;uited to touch and work upon their enmity again&s;t God and being in general, which is the only principle of action they have, whereby they can in their pre&s;ent &s;tate be prompted to do any thing, hence they are moved with care and anxiety to attend on means." If this be the truth of the matter I own our argument mu&s;t fall, but if it does it will carry away with it that a|po&s;tolic maxim on which it is grounded, and even the pillars of revealed and natural religion, leaving us afloat in the di&s;mal aby&s;s of manichei&s;m or athei&s;m.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. That it is the duty of the unregenerate to attend the means of grace will further appear, if we con&s;ider the ends for which the ordinances of the go&s;pel were in&s;tituted, and it's precepts reveal|ed to, and enjoined on, the children of men. This important argument I will endeavour to open di&s;tinct|ly in the order following.</P>
<P N="1">1. Duties are enjoined in the word of God in order to &s;ome end be&s;ides or beyond the bare performance of the actions required. They are required not barely as debts or duties, but as means de&s;igned, and fitted to &s;ub&s;erve the ends and purpo&s;es of divine wi&s;dom
<PB N="166" REF="012416_0170_0F8974BAB241FB68">
and goodne&s;s. This is e&s;pecially evident with re&s;pect to the means of grace. Thus an attendance to the word of God is enjoined, as the means of obtaining divine knowledge, faith, conver&s;ion, &s;anctification, con&s;olation and the like: Con&s;ideration is enjoined, as a means of e&s;caping de&s;truction: Prayer, as the means of obtaining needed ble&s;&s;ings temporal and &s;pi|ritual: Striving, as the means of obtaining an en|trance into the &s;trait gate: Seeking the Lord, as the means of finding him: Labouring for the mean which endureth to everla&s;ting life, as the means of obtaining it. In this re&s;pect the precepts of divine revelation, founded on the di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, differ from the injunctions of the law of nature. This requires duties merely as right, or becau&s;e due. That requires them in order to certain ends, which the wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s of God has connected with them, and de&s;igns by means of them to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P N="2">2. Such an attendance to duties, as unregenerate &s;inners are capable of, may and does an&s;wer &s;ome of tho&s;e ends, for which the&s;e duties were enjoined in the word of God. God had various ends in view in the in&s;titution of religious ordinances, and giving out his commands to mankind; &s;ome of which re&s;pect believers alone, &s;ome re&s;pect tho&s;e who are to be regenerated and effectually called, and &s;ome the world of mankind in general. By means of the&s;e precepts he de&s;igned to re&s;train the outbreakings of wickedne&s;s in the unregenerate; to direct and influ|ence them to the practice of tho&s;e virtues, whereby they might be u&s;eful to others in the world, and ob|tain tho&s;e temporal comforts and advantages which he is willing they &s;hould here enjoy. And he de&s;ign|ed e&s;pecially that tho&s;e who are in due time to be effectually called, who by nature are equally depraved with the re&s;t of the world, might, while in their unre|generate
<PB N="167" REF="012416_0171_0F8974BB73E143E8">
&s;tate, be in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;trained from the full indulgence of their lu&s;ts. When they are ready to ru&s;h into &s;uch cour&s;es, as without a miraculous in|terpo&s;ition would undo them, and ca&s;t them out of the reach of divine mercy, in the ordinary ways in which God is plea&s;ed to exerci&s;e it; then the com|mand meets their con&s;cience like a flaming &s;word, and turns their cour&s;e. In this manner they are in &s;ome &s;ort bound to their good behaviour, and kept within reach of tho&s;e means, by which they are at length re|covered from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;atan to God. And by thus bearing God's yoke, though with the &s;pirit of bondage, they are in &s;ome manner trained to it, and fitted to walk and work in it the better when they receive the &s;pirit of adop|tion. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This u&s;e of the divine commands, is well repre&s;ented by the great Calvin, as follows.

This office or u&s;e of the law the a|po&s;tle &s;eems properly to have touched, when he declares, that the law was not made for a righteous man, but for the unrighteous and di&s;obedient, &amp;c. 1 Tim. 1.9. For he &s;hews that it is a re&s;traint on the triumphant lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, which would otherwi&s;e run at large beyond mea&s;ure. Some have need of a curb to hold them in, that they may not &s;o give the reins to their carnal wantonne&s;s as utterly to ca&s;t off all regard to righteou&s;ne&s;s. For where the Spirit of God doth not yet rule, there lu&s;ts &s;ometimes boil forth in &s;uch a manner, that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e may be danger le&s;t they &s;ink the mind &s;ubject to them into forgetfulne&s;s and contempt of God. And this would be the ca&s;e, if the Lord did not make u&s;e of this remedy again&s;t it. Tho&s;e therefore whom he hath ap|pointed to inherit his kingdom, if he doth not immediately regenerate, he keeps unto the time of his vi&s;itation by means of the law under fear; not indeed that holy and pure fear which ought to be in his children, but &s;uch as is u&s;eful to this purpo&s;e, that they may be trained up to true piety, according to their pre&s;ent capacity: For whoever have lived any time in ignorance of God, will confe&s;s that this has happened to them, that by the curb of the law they might be held in &s;ome kind of fear and obedience to God, till being regenerate by the &s;pirit they might begin to love him.</Q>

<P><PB N="168" REF="012416_0172_0F8974BC32887660">To prepare tho&s;e for regeneration who are in due time to be the &s;ubjects of this grace, to keep them in a diligent attendance to tho&s;e means whereby God is wont to ingenerate faith and repentance in the hearts of his elect, is one end for which an attendance on the&s;e means is pre&s;cribed to the hearers of the go&s;pel. They are therefore commanded to &s;earch the &s;crip|tures: To hear the preached word: To pray for the pardon of &s;in; and for the holy Spirit, for all tho&s;e pur|po&s;es (I &s;uppo&s;e) for which he is ordinarily be&s;towed; one of which is to be the efficient principle of regenera|tion and conver&s;ion: To &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate: To con&s;ider the i&s;&s;ue of impenitent wickedne&s;s, le&s;t God fear them in pieces: To labour not for the meat which peri&s;heth, but for that meat which endu|reth to everla&s;ting life. By the&s;e and &s;uch like com|mands, which God has in his word directed to the hearers of the go&s;pel in general, without limiting them to qualified &s;ubjects, he impre&s;&s;es their con&s;ciences with a conviction, that an attendance to the&s;e means
<PB N="169" REF="012416_0173_0F8974BCF287F578">
is their pre&s;ent duty, whether they are regenerate or not; and that a neglect of &s;uch attendance, accord|ing to their pre&s;ent light and ability, will be an act of high di&s;obedience and contempt of God, and mo&s;t dangerous to their own &s;ouls; &s;o that they dare not live in the neglect of the&s;e means. And when they are tempted to ca&s;t off fear, and return to their for|mer cour&s;es; they are bridled and kept back by the&s;e commands, and influenced, notwith&s;tanding the re|luctances of their vain inclinations, to continue in the u&s;e of the common means of conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>All who maintain that there is ordinarily a work of illumination and conviction, preparatory to regene|ration, hold that this is wrought in the &s;oul, in and by a &s;erious attendance to the means of grace. It is al&s;o by attending to the&s;e means that the fir&s;t acts of &s;piritual life are drawn and put forth. The ordi|nances of the go&s;pel were de&s;igned to awaken hum|ble and prepare men for the grace of regeneration; to be in&s;trumental of working faith in them, whereby they we fir&s;t &s;avingly united to Chri&s;t. Now that attendance on means whereby men are prepared for regeneration, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be previous to it. That attendance whereby faith is fir&s;t obtained, can|not be an act of acceptable obedience, according to the new covenant; &s;ince faith is implied in every act of go&s;pel holine&s;s. Such an attendance on means then as goes before regeneration and conver&s;ion, may and does an&s;wer an important end for which the or|dinances of the go&s;pel were in&s;tituted.</P>
<P>That the&s;e commands, enjoining on the hearers of the go&s;pel an attendance on the means of grace, were given to excite the unregenerate as well as others to &s;erious endeavours of obedience, may be argued from God's making u&s;e of the&s;e commands to keep them waiting on him in the way of his ble&s;&s;ing. For
<PB N="170" REF="012416_0174_0F8974BDB6C871D0">
if there be any weight in the common argument from final cau&s;es, we may ju&s;tly argue that the&s;e commands were given with a de&s;ign to an&s;wer all the&s;e wi&s;e and good ends, to which they appear &s;o well adapted, and to which daily experience &s;hews that they are ordi|narily applied. Therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. Since &s;uch obedience to the&s;e commands as the unregenerate are capable of yielding, an&s;wers &s;ome of tho&s;e ends for which the&s;e commands were given; it appears that &s;uch obedience is enjoined in and by them. For a command has no power or tendency to influence the conduct of men, otherwi&s;e than by binding them to &s;uch a behaviour on their peril. It is no otherwi&s;e fitted to re&s;train the wickedne&s;s of &s;inners, and prompt them to a laudable and u&s;eful behaviour, than by forbidding the one, and enjoining the other. It is a conviction of duty imprinted on the con&s;cience by the command, and of the danger of going pre&s;umptuou&s;ly contrary to it, that binds men to their good behaviour. It was then one de&s;ign of God's promulging tho&s;e precepts which have been mentioned, to impre&s;s the hearers of the go&s;pel in general with a conviction that it is their duty to at|tend to them, according to their pre&s;ent ability; and by this conviction to put the unregenerate as well as others upon endeavours of reformation, and an at|tendance on the means of conver&s;ion, as has been de|clared. We mu&s;t therefore either &s;ay that the&s;e com|mands require &s;uch endeavours of obedience in the un|regenerate, as they were de&s;igned by God to produce; or el&s;e we mu&s;t &s;ay that God in giving the&s;e com|mands de&s;igned that they &s;hould be in&s;trumental unto the reformation of mens lives, and to excite and keep them in an attendance to the means of grace, by im|printing a fal&s;e and deceitful conviction of duty on the con&s;ciences of the unregenerate. But &s;ince it is
<PB N="171" REF="012416_0175_0F8974BE864C78F8">
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary on various accounts that men &s;hould think it to be their duty to reform their lives, and at|tend the means of conver&s;ion, though unregenerate; and without &s;uch a conviction &s;ome of the wi&s;e and good ends of God's giving men th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e commands cannot be an&s;wered by them: Why on my &s;eek to per&s;uade unregenerate &s;inners that the&s;e things are not their duty, and &s;o as much as in them lies fru&s;trate God's wi&s;e and good de&s;igns? If any imagine them&s;elves to have found that the&s;e de&s;igns of divine goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom are ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed on by delu&s;ion, I &s;hould think they had acted more advi&s;edly to have kept &s;uch di&s;|coveries to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I do not find that our author has directly attemp|ted to an&s;wer this argument from the end of God's pre&s;cribing duties to the unregenerate, &s;omething how|ever I find capable of being framed into an objection; which is therefore to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that &s;uppo&s;ing the command or God required an attendance on means previous and pre|paratory to regeneration,
<Q>and the &s;inner &s;hould be urged hereto from this con&s;ideration, it would not have the lea&s;t influence upon him, or be any motive to him to comply. He is by the &s;uppo&s;ition only &s;eeking his own intere&s;t, and cares nothing about God or duty to him, in them&s;elves con&s;idered, or for their own &s;akes.</Q>
P. 149. Therefore it &s;eems it would be in vain for God to make u&s;e of com|mands, to influence the conduct of &s;uch per&s;ons.</P>
<P>An&s;w. 1. The commands of God carry other mo|tives of obedience with them, be&s;ides the will and au|thority of the great legi&s;lator. They are inforced with mo&s;t important &s;anctions, which were de&s;igned to have their influence into the conduct of men. Our author &s;ays that "the authority of a law lies wholly in the threatning." This indeed is a grievous mi&s;take.
<PB N="172" REF="012416_0176_0F8974C01B260ED8">
Yet on the other hand it mu&s;t be owned, that the threatning is one rea&s;onable inducement to comply with it's requirement. Men often &s;ubmit to the will of the higher powers, for wrath, as well as for con|&s;cience &s;ake. A &s;ervant will obey his ma&s;ter's com|mands if he fears the effects of his di&s;plea&s;ure though he may not love him, or have any regard to his will con&s;idered &s;imply in it&s;elf. The commands God gave to the I&s;raelites had an influence on the behavi|our of tho&s;e who&s;e hearts were not right with him. As &s;oon as men know that they are commanded to do any particular actions, they may know that it is not &s;afe for them to di&s;obey. Is it not &s;trange that men &s;hould at one time &s;ay (in effect) that the threatning is the only thing that binds men to obey the laws of God; and at another time, that the command of God can have no influence on tho&s;e who are moved only by it's &s;anctions? It is not in vain to pre&s;s the commands of God on &s;inners, to move them to a compliance with their duty, if any thing e&s;&s;ential to the commands (as the &s;anctions are allowed to be) tends to move them to a compliance.</P>
<P N="2">2. It will be impo&s;&s;ible to convince tho&s;e, who view things in any mea&s;ure as they are, that &s;uch a conduct as is not their duty has any probable tendency to pro|mote their final intere&s;t. It would be a mo&s;t irregu|lar con&s;titution of things, un&s;uitable to the wi&s;dom and holine&s;s of God, if that which was directly con|trary to duty, the doing of which was mere &s;in, &s;hould have &s;uch a direct tendency to promote a man's final and eternal intere&s;t, as that he &s;hould have a rea&s;on|able encouragement to do it. I know &s;in may be overruled for good; but I deny that the word or providence of God holds forth any encouragement to do what is &s;imply evil, that good may come to the evil doer. However then &s;inners may di&s;regard the
<PB N="173" REF="012416_0177_0F8974C0B6D9B7B0">
con&s;ideration that &s;uch a conduct is their duty, yet it will be impo&s;&s;ible for us on good grounds to per&s;uade them, that it will probably be conducive to their final good, unle&s;s we can a&s;&s;ure them that it is agreable to their duty. Otherwi&s;e this doctrine mu&s;t be main|tained, viz. That "&s;in is through the divine interpo|&s;ition an advantage to the &s;inner, AND THIS IS AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO IT." Mr. H. <HI>in his great wi&s;dom</HI> (to compliment him again in his own &s;tile <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 150.</NOTE>) <HI>has devi&s;ed</HI> this <HI>method of treating with &s;inners,</HI> to encourage them to attend on means, though it be not their duty, and though their doing &s;o is mere &s;in, by <HI>per&s;uading</HI> them that this will be for their final intere&s;t. <HI>In this he is guilty of the ab&s;ur|dity of &s;uppo&s;ing</HI> that a man may have ju&s;t rea&s;on to think it will be for his final advantage to do that, the doing of which is &s;in.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is in human nature a moral &s;en&s;e, which perceives the fitne&s;s and beauty of a creature's being obedient to the commands of it's creator and right|ful &s;overeign. There is &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of duty imprint|ed on mens con&s;ciences, from a natural view of the excellency greatne&s;s and maje&s;ty of God, as di&s;po&s;es them to &s;ome kind of obedience to his will, though de&s;titute of a &s;piritual di&s;cernment and ta&s;te. It is therefore Mr. H's &s;uppo&s;ition, not ours, that the un|regenerate act merely from &s;elf-love. But this mat|ter has been before con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Corollary. When a divine precept enjoins any human performances or endeavours as means in order to &s;ome further end, &s;uch a manner of performance as is adapted to &s;ub&s;erve the end propo&s;ed is thereby enjoined, however &s;hort it may fall of what we are in duty obliged to. It is certain that &s;uch doings as are very defective and worthle&s;s con&s;idered as duties,
<PB N="174" REF="012416_0178_0F8974C171C8FEC0">
may be u&s;eful and important con&s;idered as means. The de&s;ign and direct meaning of &s;uch commands as require the u&s;e of means, is rather to be determined from a due con&s;ideration of the ends to which &s;uch means have relation, and what a manner of perfor|mance is fit to an&s;wer &s;uch ends, than from con&s;ider|ing what is the whole of our duty in this matter, and in what manner we mu&s;t behave, in order to an&s;wer fully our obligations. Such a manner of attending means as is &s;ufficient for tho&s;e ends for which they are principally enjoined, may not be &s;ufficient to acquit us, as having fully di&s;charged our duty. When God commanded the I&s;raelites to go forward when the Egyptians had pur&s;ued them to the red &s;ea, his direct de&s;ign was to pre&s;cribe a means of their deli|verance from the enemy. And when we con&s;ider the end for which he &s;o commanded them, we mu&s;t conclude the meaning was, that they &s;hould go for|ward according to their pre&s;ent ability, though he knew that they were a rebellious generation. And though they would not obey in the manner they ought, unle&s;s they did it in the exerci&s;e of perfect love to and tru&s;t in God; yet they might obey in &s;uch a manner as to an&s;wer the end for which they were ordered to pro|ceed, without any exerci&s;es of holy tru&s;t or love. And we may truly &s;ay, as the &s;criptures do in like ca&s;es, that they did as the Lord commanded them; they did what was their duty, and what they were required to do, according to the true meaning; at the &s;ame time that they did not act from &s;uch holy principles, and for &s;uch holy ends as they ought to have done. So when Chri&s;t commanded the mul|titudes to &s;it down that he might feed them, we ju&s;tly conclude from the end for which he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">dered them, that his meaning was that they &s;hould put them&s;elves in a convenient order to have food di&s;tributed among
<PB N="175" REF="012416_0179_0F8974C231FE9968">
them, whether they truly believed on him or not. And when they &s;at down, though many of them no doubt in unbelief, they obeyed his orders in their true meaning; and the direct end of his &s;o ordering them was an&s;wered, though they did not do all that was their duty. So when believers are commanded to &s;hew forth their faith by their works, to give di|ligence to make their calling and election &s;ure, to work out their &s;alvation, we ju&s;tly conclude, that the&s;e precepts require &s;uch &s;incere though imperfect endeavours of obedience as they are capable of in this life. For &s;uch endeavours are well fitted to an&s;wer the ends for which they are required, though they are never conducted in all re&s;pects as they ought to be. And in like manner the endeavours of the un|regenerate in attending on means, are adapted to an&s;wer the ends for which they are required &s;o to do. And the true and primary meaning of tho&s;e com|mands which pre&s;cribe the u&s;e of &s;uch means to them, is to be e&s;timated from the ends for which &s;uch an at|tendance is pre&s;cribed: And it mu&s;t be concluded &s;uch a manner of attendance as is conducive to &s;uch ends is required, how far &s;hort &s;oever it may be of a di&s;|charge of their whole duty. If nothing &s;hort of a full and perfect di&s;charge of duty were pre&s;cribed as the means of obtaining &s;piritual or temporal ble&s;&s;ings, &s;uch means would be &s;o high above the reach of man in his depraved &s;tate, that he never could hope for any advantage from endeavours to u&s;e them, though it be his own fault that he does not perfectly fulfil his duty.</P>
<P>But for the further illu&s;tration and vindication of this argument, and of the evidence it gives to the point in hand, &s;ome &s;cripture precepts which we have had occa&s;ion to mention mu&s;t be further attend|ed to.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="012416_0180_0F8974C2F3C58A40">The words of our Savior to the Jews, of whom he te&s;tifies that they would not come to him that they might have life, are in this view worthy of no|tice.

<P><PB N="177" REF="012416_0181_0F8974C3B1E6E318">Our argument from this text is as follows. Search|ing the &s;criptures is an in&s;trumental duty, conducing not only to the edification of believers, but al&s;o to prepare men for the &s;tate of regeneration, to in&s;truct awaken and humble &s;inners, and by the ble&s;&s;ing of God ingenerate faith in their hearts. It is an ordi|nance de&s;igned, and ordinarily ble&s;&s;ed by God for the conver&s;ion of &s;inners, and for producing in them tho&s;e preparatory di&s;po&s;itions which u&s;ually make way for this great change.</P>
<P>When therefore our Savior directed the Jews to &s;earch the &s;criptures, it is not to be doubted, but he pre|&s;cribed this as a means in order to tho&s;e ends, to which an attendance to this ordinance is ordinarily condu|cive; and primarily for tho&s;e purpo&s;es which were in the fir&s;t place nece&s;&s;ary to be an&s;wered, in order to their being &s;avingly benefited by them. And as they appear to have been not only unregenerate, but in a great mea&s;ure unprepared for the exerci&s;es of repen|tance and faith, being filled with prejudices again&s;t Chri&s;t, and in&s;en&s;ible of the &s;infulne&s;s and danger of their pre&s;ent &s;tate; it was in the fir&s;t place nece&s;&s;ary that they be led into ju&s;ter apprehen&s;ions of things, that they be awakened, and convinced of their need of a &s;piritual phy&s;ician; and made to attend more &s;eriou&s;ly to the evidences of Chri&s;t's divine mi&s;&s;ion. This was the fir&s;t &s;tep towards their obtaining a &s;av|ing
<PB N="178" REF="012416_0182_0F8974C470E6A958">
knowledge of him as Mediator, in order to which they are directed to &s;earch the &s;criptures. It mu&s;t not be thought that Je&s;us in directing the Jews to the u&s;e of means, in order to their coming to the &s;aving knowledge of him, &s;hould wholly overlook the fir&s;t or next end, to which the means he pre&s;cribed were ordained; and have re&s;pect only to a remoter and con&s;equent end, which cannot ordinarily be attained without the intervention of the former. If a prepa|ratory work of awakening and conviction, by means of the &s;criptures, was needful in order to their be|lieving on him to &s;alvation; then this was the pri|mary or next end for which he directed them to &s;earch the &s;criptures. And if they were unbelievers, it was fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary that they obtain faith by attending to the &s;criptures, before they be thereby edified and con|firmed in faith. In &s;hort, Chri&s;t directed them to &s;earch the &s;criptures for every nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful purpo&s;e which they are fitted to &s;ub&s;erve, that they might be &s;aved through faith in him. But an at|tendance to the &s;criptures is conducive to valuable purpo&s;es previous to regeneration and faith: The&s;e are therefore re&s;pected, and that primarily and im|mediately, when the unregenerate and unbelievers are called upon to attend this duty.</P>
<P>Now whoever exhorts others to &s;earch the &s;crip|tures as the means of preparing them for the grace of regeneration, and ingenerating faith in them, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily mean &s;uch an attendance to this ordinance as they are capable of previous to regeneration and faith. For as the means mu&s;t in nature go before the end, &s;o whoever directs to any action or endea|vour, <HI>as means,</HI> cannot without manife&s;t ab&s;urdity in|tend &s;uch endeavours as contain or pre&s;uppo&s;e the end for which they are appointed. This would be, as if a phy&s;ician &s;hould pre&s;cribe &s;uch means in order

However I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity of contending about this matter. But I &s;ay, if our Savior exhorts the heaters of the go&s;pel to &s;trive for &s;alvation, then he exhorts to all tho&s;e endeavours which are ordinarily needful and &s;ub&s;ervient to this end. For the word <HI>&s;trive,</HI> meaning no more than earne&s;t endeavour, is to be under&s;tood as including all nece&s;&s;ary endeavours. Now &s;ome endeavours in the u&s;e of means are ordi|narily nece&s;&s;ary previous to regeneration and conver|&s;ion. For Mr. H. owns that it is in the way of di|ligent and painful attendance on appointed means that men are u&s;ually prepared for regeneration, and are enabled and per&s;uaded to turn to God by faith in Chri&s;t. This is that &s;triving which it is in the fir&s;t place nece&s;&s;ary that an unregenerate &s;inner be per&s;uaded to in order to &s;alvation; and therefore the exhortation in the text, as addre&s;&s;ed to &s;uch, primarily enjoins that &s;triving which is in the fir&s;t place nece&s;&s;ary for per|&s;ons of this character; that is, &s;uch endeavours as are in order to regeneration and conver&s;ion, and &s;o are in nature previous thereto. When a &s;eries of endeavours of a different kind are in their place and order all nece&s;&s;ary and conducive to a certain end, not only the la&s;t link of the chain, which is immedi|ately connected with this end, but all the other links who&s;e connection with it is more remote are really of the nature of means in order to it. And any one di|recting to the u&s;e of means in general in order to &s;uch end, mu&s;t be under&s;tood to direct to the whole &s;eries of nece&s;&s;ary means, in their proper place; and primarily to that the u&s;e of which is in the fir&s;t place nece&s;&s;ary, though but mediately and remotely, and perhaps in it&s;elf not infallibly connected with the end propo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="012416_0185_0F8974C78FF9BCA8">The de&s;ign of this exhortation is to excite the hear|ers of the go&s;pel to &s;trive without delay, before the door of heaven is &s;hut again&s;t them.

To labour for this food which nouri&s;hes the &s;oul to everla&s;ting life, is to u&s;e the appointed means for obtaining a &s;aying know|ledge of and faith in Chri&s;t, with union to and in e|re&s;t in him. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr Collins in the continuation of Pool's annotations (which I had not con&s;ulted when I wrote what is here referred t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">) under|&s;tood the phra&s;e in a larger &s;en&s;e.

<P>In the &s;ame manner we might argue from other texts: But the&s;e are I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ufficient, unle&s;s our author's exceptions &s;hould be found heavy enough to turn the &s;cale again&s;t us. Let us then attend to them. Says he,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="184" REF="012416_0188_0F8974C9B16DBF60">1.
<Q>Our Savior does not direct the Jews to &s;earch the &s;criptures with all their prejudices, and in the exerci&s;e of enmity again&s;t him, and with a de&s;ire and de&s;ign to prove from them that he was an impo&s;tor.</Q>
P. 128. And the &s;ame an&s;wer is equal|ly applicable to what has been &s;aid from the exhor|tations to labour, and &s;trive, &amp;c.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Our Savior did not direct the Jews to be prejudiced again&s;t him, and hate him, while &s;earch|ing the &s;criptures. Nor did he direct them to be un|regenerate or unbelieving. But that he exhorted them to &s;earch, and &s;trive, and labour according to their pre&s;ent ability, notwith&s;tanding their unbelief, unregeneracy, and even prejudices and enmity again&s;t him, we have good rea&s;on to conclude; &s;ince their &s;erious attendance to the&s;e things appears to be a very fit means of removing their prejudices and enmity again&s;t him, and by the ble&s;&s;ing of God leading them to a true knowledge of and faith in him. We have not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of evidence that he thought an attendance on means could be of no advantage to de|liver them from their prejudices and evil di&s;po&s;itions. What rea&s;on have we then to doubt, but that the re|moval of the&s;e impediments to their conver&s;ion, &s;o far as they really took place in the minds of his hearers, was one end, for which he directed them to the u&s;e of means? And then we may be &s;ure that he did not intend &s;olely or primarily &s;uch an attendance as implies or pre&s;uppo&s;es the removal of all the&s;e impe|diments.</P>
<P>It is added,
<Q>They ought to have &s;earched the &s;criptures with a heart ready to embrace and practi&s;e the truth.</Q>
(Who doubts it?)
<Q>And therefore our Savior doubtle&s;s injoins this [only] upon them.</Q>
This con&s;equence we mu&s;t deny, until our author &s;hall make it appear, that &s;uch precepts
<PB N="185" REF="012416_0189_0F8974CDE4E61B20">
as injoin an attendance on the means of grace <HI>undoubt|edly</HI> require nothing &s;hort of &s;inle&s;s perfection, as ne|ce&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e ends for which they are pre&s;cribed, for this is no more than mens duty. Until then I &s;hall hold it as a &s;ure maxim, that &s;uch actions as are very defective, and fall far &s;hort of that perfection which they ought to have, con&s;idered as duties, may yet be very u&s;eful as means, and well adapted to an|&s;wer important purpo&s;es in &s;ub&s;erviency to the con|ver&s;ion and &s;alvation of men. And therefore when the &s;criptures direct men to duties, as means of ob|taining &s;piritual or temporal ble&s;&s;ings, we ought not to think that the means pre&s;cribed as nece&s;&s;ary to the&s;e ends mu&s;t needs include a perfect conformity to the law in all re&s;pects, (though this is no more than our duty) but &s;uch a performance of duties as is fit to &s;ub|&s;erve the&s;e ends is, I &s;hould think, <HI>doubtle&s;s</HI> pre&s;cri|bed, though much &s;hort of what we ought to do. If I &s;hould &s;ay, that men ought to &s;earch the &s;crip|tures and perform other duties with a &s;inle&s;s perfecti|on of love and obedience to God, and therefore our Savior doubtle&s;s enjoins nothing &s;hort of this, as the means of coming to the knowledge of him as medi|ator; which he knew no man would ever do in this &s;tate of imperfection; and &s;o proceed to ca&s;hier un|regenerate and regenerate endeavours together, would it not be as good rea&s;oning as this of Mr. H's?</P>
<P>But it is further pleaded,
<Q>when Chri&s;t tells them to &s;earch the &s;criptures, he directs them to do it di&s;po&s;ed and inclined to do the will of God, and not with a di&s;po&s;ition directly oppo&s;ite to that which was nece&s;&s;ary in order to an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed.</Q>
That &s;uch a &s;earch of the &s;criptures is intended as was nece&s;&s;ary &amp; conducive, in it's proper place, to an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed, I readily grant. But that a regenerate heart in &s;earching the &s;criptures, and
<PB N="186" REF="012416_0190_0F8974CE0B561980">
attending the other means of grace, is not nece&s;&s;ary in order to their an&s;wering &s;ome good purpo&s;es, in &s;ub|&s;erviency to mens coming to the knowledge of Chri&s;t as mediator, (which Mr. H. grants was the end for which Chri&s;t directed to &s;earch the &s;criptures) has been I &s;uppo&s;e proved; and is upon the matter conceded by tho&s;e who allow that there is a preparatory work to regeneration, wrought in the &s;oul by means of the word of God.</P>
<P>Our author's fir&s;t exception is, I would hope, now removed. But if this fails, he has another at hand. Says he,
<Q>When Chri&s;t directs and commands to &s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of God, and labour for the meat that endures to everla&s;ting life, he doubtle&s;s directs to that &s;eeking and labour by which men will cer|tainly obtain what they &s;eek and labour after.</Q>
P. 128. And in another place he &s;ays,
<Q>It &s;eems to me very di&s;honourable to Chri&s;t, and contrary to his wi&s;dom and faithfulne&s;s and goodne&s;s, to &s;up|po&s;e that he has given any direction and command to &s;inners in order to their &s;alvation, which they may punctually ob&s;erve and do, and yet mi&s;s of &s;alvation.</Q>
Therefore he concludes that no endea|vours of the unregenerate are commanded or direct|ed to.</P>
<P>An&s;w. There are many directions given to men, and various duties pre&s;cribed as means &s;ome way con|ducive to their conver&s;ion or &s;alvation. If men are ever &s;o exact and punctual in ob&s;erving &s;ome direct|ions, and attending to &s;ome means directed to by Chri&s;t, but utterly negligent of others; is it any di&s;|honour to his wi&s;dom goodne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s, if they mi&s;s of &s;alvation? Hearing the go&s;pel is one of the means of &s;alvation, but not the only one; we mu&s;t al&s;o believe, and obey it. Studying the word of God is the means of attaining to all that know|ledge
<PB N="187" REF="012416_0191_0F8974CE34438FF8">
which is nece&s;&s;ary to our glorifying God: But it is not a &s;ingle tran&s;ient act of attention hereto that will be &s;ufficient to furni&s;h us for every good work. A cour&s;e of diligent application to the means of in|&s;truction is nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e. That labour and &s;triving enjoined on men by Chri&s;t may be taken two ways, 1. In the <HI>compound &s;en&s;e,</HI> as including all tho&s;e endeavours which are required in order to the end propo&s;ed, whether previous or con&s;equent to re|generation. Now it is not to be thought that any one who thus labours and &s;trives, that is, who punctually ob&s;erves all the directions Chri&s;t has given in order to &s;alvation will mi&s;s of it. 2. This labour and &s;triving may be taken in the <HI>divided &s;en&s;e,</HI> &s;igni|fying any particular endeavour, or act of attendance to any one of the means of grace and &s;alvation. Now though each particular endeavour in the u&s;e of means is in it&s;elf a compliance with our Savior's direction, which pre&s;cribes a diligent attendance to <HI>all,</HI> and <HI>each</HI> of the means &s;ub&s;ervient to the end propo&s;ed; which includes at the &s;ame time <HI>each</HI> tran&s;ient act, and a con&s;tant per&s;evering <HI>cour&s;e</HI> or <HI>&s;eries</HI> of acts; yet there is no difficulty at all in &s;uppo&s;ing, that men may in &s;ome particular in&s;tances comply with our Savior's direction, and yet neglecting &s;ome of the nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;alvation may mi&s;s of it.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked, if a man labours and &s;trives as well as he can while unregenerate, mu&s;t we not ne|ce&s;&s;arily conclude from the goodne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s of Chri&s;t that he will certainly attain to a &s;aving con|ver&s;ion? I an&s;wer 1. This does not nece&s;&s;arily follow. I do not know that there is any promi&s;e in the go&s;pel of regenerating and converting grace to the endea|vours of the unregenerate. God may oblige us to wait upon him for his ble&s;&s;ing, in the diligent u&s;e of appointed means, and let us know that we have en|couragement
<PB N="188" REF="012416_0192_0F8974CEF0C24CC0">
to hope for a ble&s;&s;ing in this way, and no other; and yet re&s;erve to him&s;elf a &s;overeign li|berty of granting or withholding his ble&s;&s;ing. This he has done in other ca&s;es. He has commanded us to train up our children in the way wherein they &s;hould go, in hopes that when they are old they will not depart from it; to u&s;e means for the pre&s;ervation of life and health; to labour working with our hands, that we may have to give to him that needeth; and yet has given us no ab&s;olute a&s;&s;urance, that our endea|vours &s;hall &s;ecure to us the ends they are fitted to &s;ub|&s;erve. An unpromi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ing may be nece&s;&s;ary to render the means effectual; and yet it may well be|come the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God to command and encourage us to u&s;e the means. Surely Mr. H. will not &s;ay that it is di&s;honourable to the faithfulne&s;s of God to grant unpromi&s;ed favours, by ble&s;&s;ing means ordinarily, though not always &s;ucce&s;sful. Nor can I think he will, on &s;econd thought, find any thing more unworthy of the divine perfections, in requiring us to u&s;e &s;uch means, in order to obtain &s;uch unpromi&s;ed favours. 2. I do not think there ever was a &s;inner that attended the means of conver&s;ion as well as he was able while unregenerate. It &s;eems then to be a matter of meet &s;peculation, how we re&s;olve a ca&s;e, which we have no rea&s;on to think ever was, or will be found among the children of men. If it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed, that tho&s;e who &s;trive in all re&s;pects as well as they can while unregenerate, &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly obtain converting grace; yet I think all that are the &s;ubjects of this grace mu&s;t own, that it was to them a &s;ove|reign unpromi&s;ed favour. But 3. If it did indeed follow from our doctrine (as it does not) that there is a &s;ure connection between &s;inners attending God's ap|pointed means according to their be&s;t ability, and their obtaining converting grace; this would be no confu|tation
<PB N="189" REF="012416_0193_0F8974D0B39AD890">
of it. For we have much clearer and &s;urer evi|dence that unregenerate &s;inners are commanded to attend the means of grace, than we have that their be&s;t endeavours may fail of i&s;&s;uing in their conver&s;ion. Our doctrine will therefore &s;ooner prove this con&s;e|quence to be true, than this con&s;equence will prove our doctrine to be fal&s;e. Our doctrine is &s;upported by direct and po&s;itive evidence: But all that can be &s;aid again&s;t an in&s;eperable connection between &s;inners attending the means of grace according to their pre|&s;ent capacity, and obtaining &s;pecial and &s;aving grace, is, that it wants proof. Mr. H. has indeed attempted a direct and po&s;itive proof, that there are no promi&s;es of &s;pecial grace to the doings of the unregenerate. But his arguments only prove that there are no pro|mi&s;es of &s;alvation to &s;uch doings; which is quite a different point. This may be denied, quite con&s;i&s;t|ently with the &s;uppo&s;ition of a &s;ure connection between a &s;inner's attending the means of conver&s;ion, and ob|taining converting grace. It is thought an ea&s;y ta&s;k to &s;hew the in&s;ufficiency of his arguments to his pro|po&s;ed de&s;ign; and that he undertook needle&s;ly an <HI>anus probandi</HI> to which he was unequal. Be this as it may, the i&s;&s;ue of the pre&s;ent debate, and the force of the argument we have been in&s;i&s;ting on, is not affect|ed by any thing he has &s;aid.</P>
<P>Having thus an&s;wered to our author's objections, it may here be proper to offer &s;ome remarks on what he has &s;aid in confutation of a maxim, which he &s;ays many hold to, and build much upon; namely,

But indeed I cannot help &s;u&s;pecting that he has mi&s;took the meaning of tho&s;e he di&s;putes again&s;t. If he has, it is not the only mi&s;take of this kind that he has made. I will therefore endeavour to &s;tate the matter plainly as I under&s;tand it, and then con&s;ider his arguments.</P>
<P>The requirements of God's commands may be con|&s;idered in a twofold view, viz. as <HI>duties,</HI> or debts of obedience &s;imply; and as <HI>means,</HI> de&s;igned and fitted to &s;ub&s;erve the purpo&s;es of divine wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s. Divine commands, con&s;idered as mere decla|rations of duty, oblige all mankind to perfect obedi|ence; and al&s;o to every &s;uppo&s;able degree of holy obedience, however &s;hort of perfection; and al&s;o to each part of the duty in the compound &s;en&s;e; how|ever &s;uch part taken by it&s;elf may not contain what|ever is implied in an act of perfect, or &s;incere evan|gelical obedience. In this view the law, and each command is to be preached and inculcated on all, in it's full length and breadth, <HI>as duty.</HI> Thus the pre|cepts of the go&s;pel requiring repentance, faith, new obedience, external reformation, attending on means, are to be urged as the pre&s;ent duty, of all to whom the go&s;pel is preached. And though it is certain that no man in this world will or can comply with the&s;e precepts, with that perfection of obedience in all re|&s;pects which is his duty, yet they who have a princi|ple of true holine&s;s may, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;pecial grace, have a &s;incere re&s;pect to all God's commands; and this is their duty. And though the unregenerate have not a next power to yield &s;incere evangelical o|bedience to all or any of God's commands, yet they can, by God's common a&s;&s;i&s;tance, do many things re|quired, as to the &s;ub&s;tance and matter, and this is their duty. But their not doing the&s;e things in a ho|ly
<PB N="191" REF="012416_0195_0F8974D1F2205238">
manner is their &s;in; and a regenerate per&s;on's not doing his duty in a perfect manner is his &s;in; for which both are equally inexcu&s;eable.</P>
<P>But if we con&s;ider duties <HI>as means</HI> appointed by God to &s;ub&s;erve the purpo&s;es of his goodne&s;s to the children of men; then we &s;ay, 1. That perfect con|formity to the rule of our duty not being an appoint|ed means of &s;alvation is not, as &s;uch, pre&s;cribed to a|ny: That exerci&s;es of true faith not being appointed means to unbelievers of obtaining a &s;aving knowledge of, and faith in Chri&s;t, are not, as means to this end, pre&s;cribed to any unbeliever: That the exerci&s;es of a holy principle not being the appointed means of preparing the &s;oul for the infu&s;ion of a principle of holine&s;s are not, as &s;uch, pre&s;cribed to any unregene|rate &s;inner. 2. God has not enjoined on any the impracticable ta&s;k of exerci&s;ing &s;upernatural powers or principles before they are furni&s;hed with them, as the means of obtaining any ble&s;&s;ings temporal or &s;pi|ritual. To pre&s;cribe impo&s;&s;ible means would be the &s;ame thing as to pre&s;cribe none. Faith and repen|tance are means of &s;alvation only to tho&s;e who are en|abled to believe and repent. And commands to be|lieve and repent, in order to &s;alvation, do not require men to do the&s;e duties by the powers of nature, but by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;pecial grace. Such commands are de&s;igned, as moral inducements to excite and draw forth into act the principle or power for &s;uch exerci|&s;es, communicated to the &s;oul by the holy Spirit. Yet, 3. The hearers of the go&s;pel are to be imme|diately called to believe and repent; and the&s;e com|mands and exhortations are to be enforced with a promi&s;e of pardon and &s;alvation if they comply with them, and a threatning of damnation if they remain impenitent and unbelievers. For this is the immedi|ate duty of all, whether regenerate or not. And
<PB N="192" REF="012416_0196_0F8974D2B0EC98E0">
the inculcation of it, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, is a means of good both to &s;aints and &s;inners. The former are hereby &s;tirred up to renewed exerci&s;es of faith and repentance. And in the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er the work of conviction and humiliation may, through the in|fluence of the holy Spirit, be promoted. Hereby they are led into a ju&s;t view of the mi&s;ery and danger of a &s;tate of &s;in; and are excited earne&s;tly to implore the mercy of God, who&s;e grace alone can renew and &s;anctify their natures, and work in them that faith and repentance without which they cannot be &s;aved; and diligently to attend on all the appointed means of conver&s;ion. Be&s;ides, there is rea&s;on to hope, that the effectual influences of the holy Spirit will accompany the&s;e exhortations to &s;ome, enabling and per&s;uading them to a &s;aving compliance. And finally the exhor|tations to believe and repent imply, by nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence, an obligation to &s;omething which men have a power for while unregenerate: That is, a &s;erious attendance to the means of grace; as &s;hall hereafter be &s;hewn. But 4&punc; Some things are pre&s;cribed in &s;crip|ture, as means conducive to the &s;piritual and tempo|ral good of men, which they have a next power to comply with while unregenerate; as has been &s;hewn. The&s;e things are not only the immediate duty, but the next means, to which the hearers of the go&s;pel are called to attend without delay, according to their pre&s;ent ability, whether they are regenerate or not. The performance of the&s;e duties, as to the &s;ub&s;tance, is in the power of men, by God's common a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and this is <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> pre&s;cribed, as means tending to their &s;piritual good. The performance of the&s;e things in a holy manner, is pre&s;cribed as next means of obtain|ing &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings <HI>conditionally</HI>; that is, if they are furni&s;hed with a principle or power enabling them to &s;uch a manner of performance. But a holy manner
<PB N="193" REF="012416_0197_0F8974D376545B10">
of performance, though it be the <HI>pre&s;ent duty</HI> of all the hearers of the go&s;pel, and though it be the nece&s;|&s;ary means of &s;alvation to all, yet it is not ab&s;olutely pre&s;cribed, as the <HI>next means</HI> of obtaining &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, to men while unregenerate. For, as was &s;aid, acts of holine&s;s, as means of &s;alvation, are pre|&s;cribed to men to be done not by the powers of na|ture, but by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;pecial grace. When therefore the unregenerate are in &s;cripture called to an immediate attendance to &s;uch means as they have a next power to attend on, by God's common a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; the ab&s;olute and primary intendment of &s;uch exhortations is, that they &s;hould do it &s;eriou&s;ly and diligently, according to their pre&s;ent capacity. I add 5. That God's denying &s;pecial and effectual grace to tho&s;e who are favoured with the outward means, is a penal con&s;equence of their neglecting to do what they had a next power to do in a way of attendance on means; and this neglect is accordingly to be con&s;i|dered as the principal cau&s;e and occa&s;ion of their eter|nal ruin. And con&s;equently, though free grace is the original cau&s;e of mens &s;alvation, yet not unrege|neracy &s;imply con&s;idered, nor the denial of &s;pecial grace, but free will abu&s;ed is the original proper cau&s;e of their perdition. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>The&s;e things are required of us in order to regeneration, and it is in the power of our own wills to comply with them: And we may ob&s;erve concerning them, that the omi&s;&s;ion of them, the neglect of men in them, is the principal occa&s;ion and cau&s;e of the eternal ruin of the &s;ouls of the generality of them to whom, or among&s;t whom the go&s;pel is preached.

<P><PB N="195" REF="012416_0199_0F8974D4F6464D68">Let us now attend to his rea&s;oning. Says he, 1.
<Q>If this maxim be true, then another is as true, viz. that it is not the duty of the unregenerate to repent and believe the go&s;pel.</Q>
P. 133. An&s;w. It is granted that the maxim as he has &s;tated it is not true; and his inference from it is ju&s;t, if &s;uch a repentance and belief of the go&s;pel be intended as flows from a holy principle. But though repentance, and faith, and perfect obedience to the law be the pre&s;ent duty of the unregenerate, it will not follow that any of the&s;e things are the next means nece&s;&s;ary for them to u&s;e, in order to obtain &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings; or that they are in this view pre&s;cribed to them con&s;idered as un|regenerate. For, as was &s;aid, though the end for which the go&s;pel directs men to the u&s;e of means may be their pre&s;ent duty, yet we are not to &s;uppo&s;e ab|&s;urdly, that it is therefore pre&s;cribed as the means of it&s;elf. Our author's argument if de&s;igned to confute any maxim that we "hold to or build upon" aims <HI>toto caelo</HI> wide of the mark; and &s;o I leave it. If he will prove that faith and repentance are not only the pre&s;ent duty of the unregenerate, but the pre&s;cribed means for obtaining faith and repentance at fir&s;t, and of preparing the &s;oul for the grace of regeneration, we will con&s;ider it.</P>
<P N="2">2.
<Q>It al&s;o follows, that &s;inners are not to be ex|horted or commanded to do any thing from higher and better views di&s;po&s;itions and principles than they have.</Q>
<HI>Ibid.</HI> An&s;w. This does not follow, either from our principle, or from the maxim, as he calls it, which him&s;elf has mentioned. We &s;ay that &s;uch endeavours as men have a pre&s;ent power for are pre&s;cribed, and to be exhorted to as means; but we do not &s;ay that &s;uch endeavours are all that is to be inculcated as duty. Be&s;ides, how can it be proved to be a ju&s;t con&s;equence, that if men are to be ex|horted
<PB N="196" REF="012416_0200_0F8973EF71794C68">
to act from &s;uch <HI>principles</HI> and <HI>powers</HI> as they are furni&s;hed with, then they mu&s;t be exhorted to act from no higher <HI>views</HI> than they have at pre&s;ent? It is the proper u&s;e of exhortations to lead men into differ|ent views from what they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have, not to create new principles and powers of action. True chri&s;tians have a principle of grace, and are to be ex|horted to act from it: But they &s;ometimes have un|worthy views and di&s;po&s;itions, from which they are not to be exhorted to act. And would any one of good under&s;tanding, except Mr. H. imagine that ex|hortations calling men to act from &s;uch principles and powers as they have and are capable of exerci&s;ing, imply that they mu&s;t act from &s;uch views and di&s;po|&s;itions as at pre&s;ent actually take place? The unrege|nerate and regenerate are endowed with &s;uch princi|ples, as render them capable of acting from higher and better views than they often have: And it is the de|&s;ign of exhortations or moral &s;ua&s;ion to work on the&s;e principles, and put them in exerci&s;e. But it is added,
<Q>The only rea&s;on why impenitent enemies to God may not be exhorted to repent and love God, if there be any rea&s;on for this, is, that this requires higher principles than tho&s;e which they now act from. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on no per&s;on may be exhorted and commanded to do any thing which his heart is now &s;et again&s;t.</Q>
An&s;w. We grant that &s;inners are commanded to repent, and love God with all their hearts, and in one word to be perfect; and this is to be inculcated as duty. Yet though this is no more than their duty, there is a good rea&s;on why all this is not to be pre&s;&s;ed on them as the ne|ce&s;&s;ary means of &s;alvation; for God has not pre&s;cribed &s;inle&s;s perfection, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> means or way of &s;alvation. We grant that faith and repentance are to be inculca|ted on all the hearers of the go&s;pel, not only as duty,
<PB N="197" REF="012416_0201_0F8973F1024D9598">
but as nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;alvation. Yet there is a good rea&s;on, why a holy attendance on the means is not pre&s;cribed to &s;inners, as nece&s;&s;ary in order to a &s;aving conver&s;ion; viz becau&s;e this would make the end it's own means. Neverthele&s;s men may, in order to conver&s;ion, be properly exhorted to act from other views, than they have at pre&s;ent; and to do tho&s;e things which their hearts may now be &s;et again&s;t: And &s;uch exhortations may prevail with them, by working on &s;uch principles as they are at pre&s;ent en|dowed with. And if i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be nece&s;&s;ary that a man's pre|&s;ent views be changed, in order to his attending on means to any advantage, it is highly proper that this be exhorted to. Nor is this pre&s;cribing the end as means of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>When Peter exhorted Simon to pray to God; if he exhorted to this as a means of obtaining convert|ing grace, he did not ab&s;urdly direct him to exerci&s;e this grace in prayer, in order to obtain it; though he might properly exhort him to pray from
<Q>higher views and motives than merely worldly ones.</Q>
And when Chri&s;t exhorted the Jews to labour for the meat which endureth to everla&s;ting life; he directed to all tho&s;e endeavours which are ordinarily nece&s;&s;ary, either by immediate or remote connection with the end here propounded. And &s;ince &s;ome endeavours are ordinarily nece&s;&s;ary previous to regeneration, it is with good rea&s;on concluded, that &s;uch endeavours are here exhorted to though far &s;hort of their whole duty. But it does not follow from this conclu&s;ion that they were not directed to act for this end with higher views and aims than purely to get their fill of bread, (though this con&s;equence has been drawn "<HI>by one who would be loth to have his talent at clear rea&s;oning called in questi|on,</HI>" to return him once more his own compliment) un|le&s;s it be proved that &s;o long as they were unregenerate
<PB N="198" REF="012416_0202_0F8973F1B2B7CF78">
they were mere animals incapable of acting with high|er views than to fill their bellies. Be&s;ides, let Mr. H. if he can, &s;hew that it is un&s;uitable to divine wi&s;dom, to allure men to an attendance on the means of in&s;tructi|on, even with the hopes of temporal enjoyments. The Sinai covenant, would, I &s;u&s;pect, prove a trouble&s;ome objection again&s;t all arguments <HI>a priori,</HI> or from ante|cedent fitne&s;s, which he, or any one el&s;e could offer to that purpo&s;e. But he goes on,</P>
<P N="3">3.
<Q>Yea it hence follows, that men are not to be exhorted to do any thing contrary to their prevail|ing inclination.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;w. This &s;eems to be only a repetition of his la&s;t con&s;equence in other words. And the &s;ame an&s;wer may be returned. It is one thing to in|culcate acts of religious obedience, &s;imply as duty; and another to inculcate &s;uch acts, as means of obtain|ing &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings. To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t men to act accord|ing to their pre&s;ent power, is a different thing from exhorting them to act according to their pre&s;ent in|clination. The con&s;equence mu&s;t therefore be denied. Our author however attempts to prove it. Says he,
<Q>if men's prevailing inclination in one ca&s;e is a good rea&s;on why they may not be exhorted and com|manded to do that which is contrary to it, it is as good a rea&s;on in any other ca&s;e of this kind what|&s;oever.</Q>
That men are commanded to do that for which they have neither a pre&s;ent inclination, nor a pre&s;ent power to incline, through the mere influ|ence of moral &s;ua&s;ion, we have often granted. Though if any &s;hould deny that men are command|ed to do any thing for which they want a principle or &s;econdary power, our author mu&s;t argue more to the purpo&s;e, than he does in this place, if he means to confute them. Is the next power of inclining or willing upon the propo&s;al of moral inducements, the
<PB N="199" REF="012416_0203_0F8973F27274AFE0">
&s;ame thing with the act of inclination or willing|ne&s;s, which by means of motives is educed from it? In other words, is the &s;ubjective ground of action, the action it&s;elf? Is the cau&s;e and the effect the &s;ame thing? The author "&s;eems to take this for granted, and build much upon it as an undoubted maxim. And he is not alone in it. Other preachers and wri|ters have repre&s;ented the matter in this light," who (whether they are guilty of "<HI>ran&s;acking the &s;crip|tures</HI>" or not) would have been capable of "<HI>di&s;tin|gui&s;hing</HI>" and rea&s;oning "<HI>to</HI> better <HI>purpo&s;e.</HI>" had they not been deceived, by not duly attending to the differ|ence of the ideas confounded together under the name of <HI>moral inability.</HI> Whether an "expre&s;s vindication of this notion will be undertaken," time will &s;hew.</P>
<P>The propo&s;al and vindication of the preceding ar|guments has run out to &s;uch a length, that I will mention but one more, and that very briefly.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The hearers of the go&s;pel are commanded to repent and be converted that they may be &s;aved; and this infers an obligation on all to attend the means of conver&s;ion. Such commands implicitly require whatever is nece&s;&s;ary to be done by us, in order to a compliance with them. Now &s;ome endeavours of men while unregenerate are ordinarily nece&s;&s;ary to their fir&s;t conver&s;ion. An active attendance to the divine word is the means of faith and repentance; and as &s;uch is virtually enjoined in the command to believe and repent: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>If men are under any obligation to attend to the command to repent and be converted, or to obey this command, they are under obligation to all that which is implied in this, or nece&s;|&s;ary on their parts in order to it; therefore are under obliga|tion to hear and attend to the truths contained in God's word with the utmo&s;t concern and diligence.</Q>

In order to conver&s;ion it is nece&s;&s;ary that men attend means previous to regeneration; that tho&s;e preparatory di&s;po&s;itions may thereby be wrought in the &s;oul, without which the author &s;ays, it would not be a wi&s;e act in God to regenerate a &s;inner. Such an attendance on means is then nece&s;&s;ary on our part as does not imply a new heart; and of con&s;equence this is virtually enjoined in the command to repent. This is, if not the next, yet the remoter means of conver&s;ion. Though a man while unconverted does not comply with the command requiring conver&s;ion; yet if he diligently attends on God's appointed means, he therein does &s;omething implicitly required in that command, and which is therefore his duty. 2. Sup|po&s;e a man has a new heart, or a power for holy acts created in him; yet until he is a believer he is not united to Chri&s;t, or accepted in him.

to us, not as being in Chri&s;t, but as acting with a good and hone&s;t heart, and it would &s;eem (accord|ing to his rea&s;oning) out of re&s;pect purely to the goodne&s;s and hone&s;ty of our exerci&s;es, and &s;o I fear this notion will prove as &s;ubver&s;ive of the go&s;pel, as promi&s;es to unregenerate endeavours. For until we are united to Chri&s;t, our hone&s;t hearts with their ex|erci&s;es are only an inherent qualification, which does not denote that &s;pecial relation to the mediator which gives us an intere&s;t in the ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant.</P>
<P>I find nothing urged by Mr. H. tending to ener|vate our argument, but what has been already an&s;|wered. He &s;ays, the word of God always requires us to be ready to receive the truth in love; if we do this we &s;hall not attend on means as do the unregenerate. True. This is always our duty.

To this we an&s;wer, as be|fore, that unregeneracy and an impenitent unbelieving heart, are not required as adjuncts or qualifications of mens attendance on means; but the attendance it|&s;elf is ab&s;olutely required of men, though unregene|rate and impenitent; and has, by the appointment and ble&s;&s;ing of God, a &s;ub&s;erviency to their &s;aving conver&s;ion, as well as to other de&s;irable purpo&s;es. Nor is it any objection, that &s;uch an attendance comes far &s;hort of the duty required of men in the word of God. A perfect compliance with our duty in any in|&s;tance is not an appointed means of &s;alvation. Mr. H. &s;ays truly,
<Q>As God does not make the depraved will of &s;inners the rule of their duty, &s;o he does not make the rule of their duty the rule of his conduct in giving or not giving a new heart;</Q>
I add, neither does he make the rule of their duty the rule of his will and wi&s;dom, in pre&s;cribing to us the means of

<Q>Why did the apo&s;tles direct men immediate|ly to repent, and be converted, and believe on Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</Q>
I an&s;wer again, 1. Becau&s;e it was their duty. 2. It was the nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;alvation. 3. Such calls are <HI>vehicula gratiae,</HI> in and with which God is wont to convey his &s;pecial grace to &s;ome, enabling and per&s;uading them to an immediate compliance. And 4. That a diligent waiting on God in the u&s;e of appointed means for further light and grace might be promoted in all, according to their pre&s;ent ability. It may be the next duty of &s;inners to believe and re|pent, and yet a further attendance on the means of grace, with further degrees of light and conviction in con&s;equence of &s;uch attendance, may be nece&s;&s;ary for them, before they can &s;avingly believe and repent; in which ca&s;e this is to be exhorted to as the next means of &s;alvation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Per&s;ons that are not humbled are called to come to Chri&s;t.

<HEAD>SECT. IV. A Reply to Mr. Hopkins's Arguments.</HEAD>
<P>MR. H's fir&s;t and principal argument, founded on our Savior's di&s;cour&s;e with the &s;cribe, concern|ing the fir&s;t and great commandment, has been already repre&s;ented and an&s;wered to. But as he has, in order to illu&s;trate and confirm his rea&s;oning, added &s;ome things, the examination of which did not then &s;o properly fall in our way; I will here in the fir&s;t place briefly attend to them.</P>
<P>He quotes that text in I&s;ai. 1.12. as a clear confir|mation of his argument and doctrine.
<Q>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required the&s;e things at your hands?</Q>
On which he thus glo&s;&s;es.
<Q>The&s;e things were required, but not for their own &s;ake, but only as an expre&s;&s;ion of their re&s;pect and love to God. Therefore when this cea&s;ed to be exerci&s;ed and expre&s;&s;ed, and they appeared not to have the love of God, but the contrary, their at|tendance on the&s;e externals was not doing any thing that was required of them. The&s;e things were not required of them as they performed them. There|fore in their attendance on them they really did no|thing that was required of them, and &s;o did not the lea&s;t part of their duty.</Q>
P. 119.</P>
<P>An&s;w. We have no rea&s;on to think that their at|tendance on the externals of religious wor&s;hip is here called an abomination, and what was not required of them, merely or principally becau&s;e they were unrege|nerate.
<PB N="204" REF="012416_0208_0F8973F634828140">
For at other times, when the I&s;raelites at|tended on the ordinances of divine wor&s;hip, there is no hint that what they did was not required of them, but on the contrary, it is repeatedly &s;aid that "they did according to the commandment of the Lord," though they acted not from a principle of true holi|ne&s;s. Some te&s;timonies to this purpo&s;e I have had occa&s;ion to mention, concerning that rebellious gene|ration, who&s;e carca&s;es fell in the wilderne&s;s; who not only were, but appeared to be de&s;titute of true love to God, by their daily perver&s;ene&s;s and murmuring again&s;t him, for which they were rebuked, threatned and puni&s;hed from time to time. Yet there is not one word intimating in the lea&s;t that it was not re|quired of them, ungodly as they were, to keep the pa&s;&s;over, and &s;abbath, and offer the &s;acrifices pre&s;cribed in their law: But on the contrary, in doing the&s;e things they are &s;aid to have done according to the commandment of the Lord. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 12.28. Numb. 9.5.8.20, &amp;c.</NOTE> If the&s;e things were required of the unregenerate I&s;raelites, however de&s;ti|tute of love to God, in the time of Mo&s;es, we may be &s;ure that it was not their unregeneracy, or want of holy love, &s;imply con&s;idered, that was the rea&s;on why they were in the time of I&s;aiah challenged in this man|ner, "who hath required the&s;e things at your hands?"</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t refre&s;h our author's memory, which &s;eems a little to have failed him. We have lately heard him pleading, that
<Q>God in his conduct toward the people of I&s;rael, and in what he &s;ays of them, acted not as the &s;earcher of hearts; but has re&s;pect only to their external appearance and con|duct.</Q>
If &s;o, it was not the want of inward holine&s;s that was the cau&s;e why their religious performances are declared to be an abomination, and not required at their hands; but it was the irregularity of their
<PB N="205" REF="012416_0209_0F8973F6F1570310">
outward behaviour. The prophet appears evidently, in this pa&s;&s;age, to reprove them for their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the Sinai covenant; the condition of which was ex|ternal obedience, and it's &s;anction, temporal ble&s;&s;ings and judgments. The &s;ins with which he charges them are outward acts of di&s;obedience: And the mo|tives with which he per&s;uades them to repentance are the promi&s;es and threatnings of the Sinai law. "If ye be willing and obedient, ye &s;hall eat the good of the land: But if ye refu&s;e and rebel, ye &s;hall be de|voured with the &s;word." Ver. 19, 20.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons here addre&s;&s;ed were gro&s;ly immoral in their lives; and yet affected to appear zealous in their attendance on religious ordinances; thinking, it &s;eems, as did the phari&s;ees afterward, hereby to cloke their neg|lect of the weightier matters of the law. For this end they overcharged God's altars, with their free will offerings; which though allowed and accepted when offered in a right manner, yet were not ab&s;olutely re|quired by any divine precept. There was not &s;uch <HI>a multitude</HI> of &s;acrifices ab&s;olutely required, as the ex|pre&s;&s;ion here naturally imports. They ob&s;erved the &s;acred fe&s;tivals, it is probable, with a &s;olemn parade; and yet in an irregular manner, not according to the rules pre&s;cribed to them. They might then be very ju&s;tly reprimanded with "who hath required the&s;e things at your hands, to tread my courts in this man|ner, and on &s;uch an errand, when your hands are full of blood, oppre&s;&s;ion, and all kinds of unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s?" This text is therefore far from proving any thing to our author's purpo&s;e. His ob&s;ervations from it have been before con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Another text quoted by him is Jer. 22.23.
<Q>I &s;pake not to your fathers, nor commanded them, in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings and &s;acrifices:
<PB N="206" REF="012416_0210_0F8973F7B0D82298">
But this thing commanded I them, &s;aying, obey my voice.</Q>
From which he argues in the &s;ame manner as above. Expo&s;itors agree that the negative expre&s;&s;ion is meant comparatively. The &s;en&s;e is, To obey is better than &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>He goes on,
<Q>None will &s;uppo&s;e, I pre&s;ume, that the devils did any duty, when they cried out, Thou art the Chri&s;t the Son of God. Or when the chief devil in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed man prayed to Chri&s;t in the name of the re&s;t, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, I be|&s;eech thee torment me not. And will any one im|agine that the&mdash;unregenerate do any more duty in their external words and actions, than the devils did in the in&s;tances mentioned?</Q>
P. 119. "Won|derful argument"! If he will prove that the devil confe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;t voluntarily, and not by con&s;traint; that he was by revelation from God commanded &s;o to do; that this was the in&s;tituted means of obtaining a ble&s;&s;ing; that God encouraged him to hope for mercy in this way; that he confe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;t, and prayed to him from a conviction of con&s;cience that it was his duty; then this matter will be further con|&s;idered.</P>
<P>Our author proceeds to di&s;cour&s;e of &s;elf-love, and natural con&s;cience, endeavouring to &s;hew that they are no principles of obedience. The &s;ub&s;tance of what he has &s;aid, has been examined in the &s;econd &s;ection. They are principles, whereby men are di|rected and prompted to do &s;uch kind of actions, as have been proved to be enjoined on them; &s;o are their duty. But he objects, "there is no love to God and our neighbour, while men act only from natural principles." An&s;w. Not to in&s;i&s;t that there is &s;ome kind of good will to others, natural to man|kind; we &s;ay, that &s;omething be&s;ides love is requi|red, and &s;omething which may be done from other
<PB N="207" REF="012416_0211_0F8973F950375A18">
principles than holy love; as has been proved. He pleads further, "there is no obedience in acting mere|ly from natural principles." An&s;w. It is not pre|tended that all acts which flow from &s;elf-love and na|tural con&s;cience, are acts of obedience to God. But the doing of &s;uch actions as men are commanded to do, though from natural principles, is obedience; un|le&s;s the &s;criptures mi&s;call it. Though an erroneous con&s;cience is not a principle of obedience, in tho&s;e things wherein it errs; yet when it's dictates are ac|cording to truth, pre&s;cribing what is really matter of duty, (which we have proved is the ca&s;e, when it re|pre&s;ents to the unregenerate their obligation to do what is enjoined on them, according to their pre&s;ent ability) then it may be a principle directing and di&s;|po&s;ing them to do what is their duty. It is added,
<Q>If the dictates of con&s;cience are according to truth, they declare that love to God and our neighbour is all that is required.</Q>
An&s;w. Prove it, and an|&s;wer our rea&s;ons to the contrary, otherwi&s;e you beg in vain. It is further pleaded,
<Q>there is but one prin|ciple of obedience, which is love to God and our neighbour.</Q>
This al&s;o we deny, 1. Becau&s;e we have proved that there are other principles of obedi|ence. 2. Becau&s;e love, being it&s;elf an act of obedi|ence, (Mr. H. &s;ays it is the whole of obedience) mu&s;t therefore flow from &s;ome principle prior to, and di|ver&s;e from it&s;elf. I add that love alone is not an ade|quate principle of obedience, in tho&s;e actions which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to flow from it. It's operations mu&s;t be guided by faith, and a right con&s;cience, other|wi&s;e they will be irregular; however good the prin|ciple of love is in it&s;elf. As to what is &s;aid of &s;elf-love, I have el&s;ewhere con&s;idered that point. I will not return tho&s;e exclamations of ab&s;urdity, which our author &s;o profu&s;ely pours forth at all differing from
<PB N="208" REF="012416_0212_0F8973FA22067300">
him on the&s;e points; but only query in his own words on another occa&s;ion, "are we the only per|&s;ons that are confu&s;ed and bewildered?"</P>
<P>His &s;econd argument is as follows:
<Q>All God's commands to his creatures are an expre&s;&s;ion of his will and heart, which is the &s;ame with their being a tran&s;cript of his moral perfections, as the common phra&s;e is. But God's moral perfection is his holi|ne&s;s: And his will is holy. Therefore whatever command is an expre&s;&s;ion of his will, mu&s;t require holine&s;s. That which requires any thing el&s;e, is no expre&s;&s;ion of his moral perfections; therefore can|not be the expre&s;&s;ion of the will of God, and &s;o can|not be his command.</Q>
P. 122.</P>
<P>An&s;w. The holine&s;s of God may be expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e commands, which require the doing of that which is not in it&s;elf holine&s;s; it what is commanded be not &s;in, but good in it's kind; and if the end for which it is commanded be agreable to his wi&s;dom and holi|ne&s;s. All the works of God are expre&s;&s;ions of his will and holy perfections; yet he is the proper cau&s;e of other effects be&s;ides holine&s;s. There is an actual concurrence and co-operation of divine providence with men, even in their &s;inful actions; though he be not the author, or po&s;itive cau&s;e of their &s;infulne&s;s. And this providential concour&s;e is an expre&s;&s;ion of his holine&s;s; yet the effect is not a holy action in the creature. His moral perfections are manife&s;ted, in his &s;o con&s;tituting the connection of things with each other, that tho&s;e means which have nothing of true holine&s;s in them &s;hould conduce to the happine&s;s of tho&s;e who u&s;e them; and in letting men know it, that they might have encouragement, or a rea&s;onable inducement to be in the u&s;e of &s;uch means; and in pre&s;cribing an attendance to them by his &s;overeign authority, on pain of incurring the effects of his high
<PB N="209" REF="012416_0213_0F8973FAB4C0A768">
di&s;plea&s;ure, as a motive to &s;uch attendance. Indeed if &s;uch actions were pre&s;cribed, the doing of which is &s;in; or if any real encouragement were held forth to men, either in God's word, or in the con&s;tituted con|nection of means and ends, that they might have a rea&s;onable inducement to <HI>&s;uch actions,</HI> (as our author maintains) we could not reconcile this with the divine holine&s;s. But far be &s;uch imaginations. God's pre|&s;cribing to the I&s;raelites the keeping of the pa&s;&s;over, in order to their pre&s;ervation from death by the de&s;troying angel; was it not an expre&s;&s;ion of his moral perfecti|ons? And yet the pre&s;cribed means for this end was the outward act of killing a lamb, &s;prinkling the blood, &amp;c. which the unregenerate performed. All the com|mands, coun&s;els, or advices of a good man, ought to be expre&s;&s;ions of his holine&s;s; yet Paul, and even our Savior commanded, or advi&s;ed to the doing of that, which did not imply any holy exerci&s;e, as has been noted. And, unle&s;s I am mi&s;informed, our author and others like minded will not &s;cruple to ad|vi&s;e to an attendance on the means of grace, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of a &s;tate of unregeneracy; though they own that they have no in&s;truction from the &s;criptures for &s;o doing. I will &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch advices are thought by them to be expre&s;&s;ions of benevolence and holine&s;s; not of &s;in, and enmity to being in general; notwith&s;tanding the actions advi&s;ed to are not holy exerci&s;es. Why mu&s;t it then be thought incon&s;i&s;tent with the holine&s;s of God to enjoin &s;uch actions? Moreover the perfect holine&s;s of God is expre&s;&s;ed in the con&s;titution of the new covenant, with the means or conditions of &s;alvation therein required; yet not perfect, but &s;incere acts of holine&s;s, are, according to the new covenant, the pre&s;cribed way of our walking with God, and obtaining eternal life. On the whole, the principle on which this argument of Mr. H. de|pends,
<PB N="210" REF="012416_0214_0F8973FB7151CF08">
viz <HI>That a command requiring any thing &s;hort of our whole duty, can be no expre&s;&s;ion of the holine&s;s of God,</HI> being intirely de&s;titute of proof; a bare de|nial of it had been &s;ufficient, according to the laws of di&s;putation. And yet I have, beyond what is incum|bent on a re&s;pondent, offered &s;uch evidences of the fal&s;hood of this principle, as are perhaps a &s;ufficient confutation. So I pa&s;s to his</P>
<P>Third argument, which &s;tands thus:
<Q>Duty to God always &s;uppo&s;es &s;omething given to God, and done for him, out of regard and re&s;pect to him. But where there is no true love to God there is no true re&s;pect paid to him; nothing is offered to him or done for him in the intention and de&s;ign of the doer. Therefore there is really no duty done. Nothing that is due to God is given; and &s;o no command that he can give is obeyed.</Q>
P 122.</P>
<P>An&s;w. Duty may be taken either in the compound, or in the divided &s;en&s;e. In the former &s;en&s;e it e&s;&s;en|tially includes a holy re&s;pect to the will and authority of God, with every other circum&s;tance implied in an act of true holine&s;s. In the latter &s;en&s;e, each particu|lar part of the <HI>compound duty</HI> is in it&s;elf matter of duty. For whatever is contained in, and enjoined by the divine command, is duty: But actions externally good are enjoined in the divine command <HI>in them&s;elves,</HI> as well as a holy re&s;pect to God in the performance. If a man has no re&s;pect to God in doing an action good in it&s;elf, he is guilty of &s;in in the manner of the performance; but the performance is not, for the &s;ub&s;tance, contrary to the divine command. On the other hand, if through culpable ignorance, or an erro|neous con&s;cience, he neglects to do an external duty commanded by God; for in&s;tance, if he &s;hould neg|lect to pray, or give alms, when he ought to do it, thinking that it was his duty to forbear the&s;e things,
<PB N="211" REF="012416_0215_0F8973FC33BB6498">
until he had clear and &s;ore evidences of his regenera|tion; he would undoubtedly be guilty of a &s;in of o|mi&s;&s;ion, however he might be &s;uppo&s;ed to ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a &s;in|cere re&s;pect to God, and to what he apprehends is his will, in &s;uch forbearance of his duty. But if a man &s;hould <HI>neglect</HI> to do external duties, regardle&s;s of the command of God; &s;uch a one would violate a double obligation, and incur a double guilt. Di&s;regard of the authority of God is in it&s;elf &s;in: And the omi&s;&s;ion of an external duty, as to the &s;ub&s;tance, is in it&s;elf &s;in. Con&s;equently the performance is in it&s;elf required, &s;o is duty. For it cannot be in it&s;elf &s;in to omit that, the doing of which is not in it&s;elf duty. The commands of God enjoin duties both in the compound, and in the divided &s;en&s;e: They enjoin the whole conjunctly, and each part &s;everally and by it&s;elf; as has been al|ready &s;hewn. Our author's definition of duty being fallacious, his argument founded on the fallacy mu&s;t fall.</P>
<P>Something however &s;eems to be aimed at, which will require further con&s;ideration. And therefore (craving pardon for taking the liberty) I will endeavour to mend the argument a little by putting the word o|bedience in&s;tead of duty, as being of a le&s;s general &s;ignification. Obedience does indeed imply a re&s;pect to the will and command of another; though duty in the <HI>divided &s;en&s;e,</HI> does not nece&s;&s;arily imply &s;uch a re&s;pect. An act of religious obedience involves in it's &s;ub&s;tance not only the performance of an action which is in it&s;elf the matter of duty, but al&s;o a regard to the command of God, as a rea&s;on and motive to the per|formance. If it &s;hould then be &s;aid, that allowing un|regenerate &s;inners may perform actions materially good, which may be termed the matter of duty; yet &s;ince they have no true re&s;pect to God or his com|mands in any of their performances, there is nothing
<PB N="212" REF="012416_0216_0F8973FCF3D2F3D8">
of obedience in what they do, however good and u&s;e|ful in it&s;elf. I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. Suppo&s;ing there is nothing of religious obedience in their doings, yet they ought to do actions materially good; and if they do &s;o they will not incur that guilt which in&s;eperably attends the neglect of them in it&s;elf, or for it's own &s;ake. There is an obligation to do the action, as well as to have a re&s;pect to the command of God in doing it, as has been ob&s;erved. If we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the unregenerate to be perfect athei&s;ts, yet we may truly &s;ay that they ought to be ju&s;t and kind in their behaviour towards mankind. And in this ca&s;e, though there would be nothing of religious obedience in any of their actions, yet they could not be charged with the &s;in of omitting tho&s;e acts of ju&s;tice and kind|ne&s;s, which they would otherwi&s;e be guilty of, be&s;ides their athei&s;tical di&s;regard of God. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. There are two kinds of obedience to the com|mands of God &s;poken of in &s;cripture, and a twofold re&s;pect to him. A conviction of the greatne&s;s and maje&s;ty of God, his power and right to puni&s;h his re|bellious creatures, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of his commands, and the obligation and fitne&s;s of a creature's being &s;ubject to the will of it's creator and &s;upreme ruler, has a tendency to put men upon &s;ome endeavours of obedience to his commands, from the natural princi|ples of &s;elf-love and the moral &s;en&s;e, however de&s;titute of a principle of true holine&s;s. Such endeavours of obedience are good in their kind, as well as the prin|ciples and motives prompting thereto; and they are commanded by God, on &s;uppo&s;ition of a &s;tate of un|regeneracy, as has been proved. And they who neg|lect diligent endeavours to do what God has com|manded; according to their pre&s;ent ability, though un|regenerate, will find that their wilfully refu&s;ing to do what they had a next power to do, in a way of reli|gious
<PB N="213" REF="012416_0217_0F8973FDB2CBD860">
obedience, will terribly add to the guilt they are chargeable with, for not doing &s;uch duties as at pre|&s;ent they are incapable of, for want of a principle of holine&s;s. There is another kind of obedience attended with, and flowing from a divine and &s;upernatural prin|ciple, with a &s;piritual di&s;cernment of &s;piritual things. This is peculiar to the regenerate, who have a holy re&s;pect to God and his will. If then Mr. H. means to a&s;&s;ert, that a holy re&s;pect to God is implied in what|ever is duty, or obedience of any kind; he does but humbly beg the que&s;tion. If he means, that the un|regenerate have no kind of regard to God or his com|mand, this we are warranted to deny, both from &s;crip|ture and experience; nor do I find one word offered in confirmation of it.</P>
<P>His fourth argument is,
<Q>If God &s;hould command the unregenerate to do any thing, as &s;uch, and which they may do con&s;i&s;tently with their having no love to him, and being under the power of per|fect and reigning enmity again&s;t him; this is, in &s;ome degree, if not wholly giving up his demands on them which require them to love him, to repent, and embrace the go&s;pel.</Q>
P. 122, 123.</P>
<P>An&s;w. We deny the con&s;equence. If indeed no|thing was required of men, <HI>as duty,</HI> but what they were able to do from natural principles while unrege|nerate; this would imply that the demands of the law were, in &s;ome degree, given up. But this &s;up|po&s;ition we reject. Will Mr. H. &s;ay, that God has given up the demands of his law, in pre&s;cribing to men, endeavours which fall &s;hort of &s;inle&s;s perfection, as means of obtaining temporal or &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings? Or will he &s;ay, that nothing &s;hort of &s;inle&s;s perfection is pre&s;cribed, as nece&s;&s;ary, or &s;ub&s;ervient to the&s;e pur|po&s;es? Has not God, in the new covenant, required &s;uch duties and exerci&s;es, as means of &s;alvation to be|lievers,

which are practicable by them in this &s;tate of imperfection, through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that grace which he affords to them, notwith&s;tanding this &s;tate of im|perfection is their &s;in?

<P>God has more regard to his own honour, and the honour of his law, than we have; and he knows bet|ter what becomes his divine maje&s;ty. Yet he has re|quired &s;incere though imperfect endeavours of obedi|ence, as the way and means of making our calling and election &s;ure, and having an entrance mini&s;tred to us abundantly into his heavenly kingdom. And in the Sinai covenant, not a perfect conformity to the whole moral law was enjoined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the nece&s;&s;ary condition of enjoyning the temporal and &s;piritual privileges, granted to that favoured people who were &s;ubject to it.

An external ob&s;ervance of God's laws and ordinances &s;ecured the divine ble&s;&s;ing and pro|tection to that nation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Er&s;kine's Di&s;&s;ertation on the Sinai Covevant.</NOTE> How then can it be &s;hewn, that the obligation of the divine la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is in any mea&s;ure made void, it God enjoins on the unregenerate an at|tendance to means, according to their pre&s;ent ability, in order to obtain tho&s;e &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings they need?

P. 124.</P>
<P>An&s;w. If we carefully and di&s;tinctly con&s;ider what it is that God commands unregenerate &s;inners to do, in order to obtain &s;piritual and temporal ble&s;&s;ings; and then enquire wherein con&s;i&s;ts the &s;infulne&s;s of their actions, or in other words, wherein they are in|conformable to the divine law; we &s;hall be able ea&s;ily to &s;ee that what God requires is not &s;in, but the whole &s;infulne&s;s of the performance is a circum&s;tance, or ad|junct, which the depraved creature has added to an action good in it&s;elf. What God has enjoined on &s;in|ners as the means of good to them, is actions materi|ally good; for in&s;tance, the reformation of their lives, and an attendance on the means of grace. This &s;urely is not &s;in in it&s;elf: If it was, it would be for|ever unlawful for a man, in any ca&s;e, to reform, or u&s;e means. Actions which are in them&s;elves e&s;&s;enti|ally &s;inful, that is, forbidden in all po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es, may not be done either by the unregenerate or the regene|rate; for in&s;tance, wilful lying; this is unlawful, even &s;uppo&s;ing the liar &s;hould therein &s;incerely aim at the

glory of God; which, through error of con&s;cience, is a po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e. Such actions are for the &s;ub&s;tance and matter of them inconformable to the divine com|mand. There is no need of enquiring into the cha|racter of the agent, or for what ends he acted, in order to determine that he did evil. But an attendance on the means of grace is not ab&s;olutely, and in all ca&s;es forbidden. On the contrary, it is ab&s;olutely enjoined on all the hearers of the go&s;pel; con&s;equently the o|mi&s;&s;ion of it is &s;in in it&s;elf: And we may be &s;ure, without any further enquiry, that he who neglects the&s;e means, having opportunity and capacity of at|tending upon them, therein is blameable. When any one &s;ins in attending on means, it is an accidental de|fect; and the fault lies not in the <HI>action it&s;elf,</HI> or in the <HI>divided &s;en&s;e,</HI> for that is ab&s;olutely commanded, and the omi&s;&s;ion would be &s;in in it&s;elf; but the fault lies in the wrong manner and circum&s;tances of the perfor|mance: And this irregularity in the circum&s;tances, con&s;titutes the action a &s;in taken in the compound &s;en&s;e, as including it's circum&s;tances, though in it&s;elf it be good and a commanded duty.</P>
<P>We &s;ay then, that God has ab&s;olutely commanded the hearers of the go&s;pel, without di&s;tinction, to attend the means of religion: But he has not enjoined any of tho&s;e irregular circum&s;tances, or defects, with which the performances of the unregenerate are corrupted. The&s;e defects he has forbidden: Yet he has ab&s;olute|ly enjoined the actions them&s;elves, in the divided &s;en&s;e, as matter of duty, and as means of good to men; notwith&s;tanding the &s;in men may be guilty of in the manner and circum&s;tances of the performance; and though it is certain, that &s;o long as they are un|regenerate, they neither will nor can perform them in a holy and &s;piritual manner.

Nor is this in any mea&s;ure im|plied in that.</P>
<P>But &s;ays our author, "It mu&s;t be &s;o" (that is to command men to do any thing while unregenerate mu&s;t be commanding &s;in)
<Q>if all they do is &s;in, which is I think certain to a demon&s;tration.</Q>
I an&s;wer, if we take the actions of the unregenerate in the com|pound &s;en&s;e, including the manner and all the circum|&s;tances of their performances; then it is true, they are not holy but &s;inful; though the actions in them&s;elves, or in the divided &s;en&s;e may be good. For an action mu&s;t be conformable to the law in manner and cir|cum&s;tances, as well as in it's &s;ub&s;tance, otherwi&s;e it cannot be denominated holy. It may be conformable to the command in one re&s;pect, and not in another. In whatever re&s;pect it agrees with the command, it is good, and matter of duty; though if in any re&s;pect it be e&s;&s;entially defective, there is no true holine&s;s in it; but taken as including &s;uch defects, it is on the whole &s;inful. One &s;in is enough to denominate a man a &s;inner in the eye of the law, though all his other actions are conformable to it. And one defect or ir|regularity in an action is enough to denominate it &s;in|ful in the eye of the law, though in all other re&s;pects conformable to it. But though all the actions of the unregenerate in the compound &s;en&s;e &s;werve from the rule of duty in &s;ome re&s;pects, &s;o are to be accounted &s;inful;
<PB N="221" REF="012416_0225_0F897474741607B8">
yet &s;ome of their actions do not &s;werve from the rule in every re&s;pect, &s;o are not all &s;in, or every way &s;in|ful, but are materially good. Now it does not imply commanding &s;in, to command the doing of that which is in it&s;elf good, though it &s;hould be certain that it will not be done in a holy manner. For in this ca&s;e the &s;in does not lie in what is commanded, that is, in the &s;ub&s;tance of the performance, but wholly in the irre|gular manner and circum&s;tances, which, though fore|&s;een, are not commanded but forbidden.</P>
<P>To prove that all the doings of the unregenerate are &s;in, our author argues, that
<Q>In the exerci&s;es of a moral agent there can be no medium between ho|line&s;s and &s;in.</Q>
But he either mi&s;takes the meaning of this maxim, and holds it in an untrue &s;en&s;e; or el&s;e it makes nothing to the purpo&s;e of his argument. It may be true that no actions of a moral agent in the compound &s;en&s;e, taking in all their adjuncts and cir|cum&s;tances, are of an indifferent nature, neither right nor wrong upon the whole: And it is true, that no actions of the unregenerate are upon the whole, in all re&s;pects, either good or indifferent. They are all &s;inful in their manner and circum&s;tances. But an action materially good, may, according to the different man|ner and circum&s;tances of it's performance, become &s;in|ful or holy in the compound &s;en&s;e; though no po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tances can make an action materially forbidden become an act of holine&s;s. And there are numberle&s;s actions materially indifferent, that is not ab&s;olutely commanded or forbidden; which yet cannot be either done or forborn without &s;uch concomitant circum&s;tan|ces, as may render them on the whole, <HI>pro hic &amp; nunc,</HI> either perfectly right, and &s;o holy, or &s;ome way wrong and improper. Now an action right in &s;ome re&s;pects and wrong in others, is not holy in the eye of the law, which requires a rectitude in every re&s;pect; con&s;e|quently
<PB N="222" REF="012416_0226_0F897474F1316240">
it is in the compound &s;en&s;e &s;inful: And yet being conformable to the law in &s;ome re&s;pect, for in|&s;tance as to the matter of it, it has therefore &s;omething belonging to it which is (not indifferent but) good, and matter of duty; which however does not contain all that goodne&s;s which is e&s;&s;ential to true holine&s;s. Of this nature are the be&s;t actions of the unregenerate. To require the&s;e in them&s;elves, or in the divided &s;en&s;e, is not requiring &s;in; for in this &s;en&s;e they are not &s;in: Nor is it requiring indifferent actions, which would be an ab&s;urd &s;uppo&s;ition; for when required, they would be no longer indifferent but duty, whatever they were before. And however certain it may be that men will defile the&s;e duties by their manner of performing them, this is no part of what God requires of them, nor has it any tendency to their good.</P>
<P>I may further add, that &s;ince the be&s;t duties of be|lievers are &s;infully defective, it may as well be argued, that God commands &s;in, in requiring of them &s;uch duties as they are able to perform in this &s;tate of im|perfection; as that he commands &s;in if he pre&s;cribes an attendance on means previous to regeneration. It will be &s;aid, that &s;o far as they obey the divine com|mand, their actions are not &s;inful. True. But in one re&s;pect, that is in the &s;trength or inten&s;ene&s;s of their exerci&s;es, all they do comes far &s;hort of what is their duty. Mu&s;t we then conclude, that if God pre&s;cribes evangelical obedience to chri&s;tians as duty, and as the nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;alvation, then he pre&s;cribes the &s;inful imperfection as well as the obedience, &s;ince he knows that it will be imperfect? I hope not. Nor is there any more nece&s;&s;ity to conclude, that in pre|&s;cribing an attendance on means to the unregenerate, the &s;inful defilements with which he knows their en|deavours will be corrupted, mu&s;t be al&s;o commanded. In &s;hort, Mr, H's argument is nothing but that &s;ophi|&s;tical
<PB N="223" REF="012416_0227_0F897475B1C3F998">
one, called by logicians, <HI>Argumentatio a &s;en&s;u compo&s;ito ad &s;en&s;um divi&s;um.</HI></P>
<P>He endeavours however to vindicate it. Says he,
<Q>Take away the &s;in, and &s;eparate it from every thing el&s;e, and there remains nothing in which there is any moral agency, and &s;o nothing in which there is either &s;in or duty, and therefore nothing which can be the &s;ubject of command: Con&s;equently if the &s;in be not commanded, nothing is commanded.</Q>
Ibid.</P>
<P>An&s;w. The word &s;in may be taken in two &s;en&s;es. 1. As &s;ignifying the whole compound action with all it's circum&s;tances, which is in &s;ome re&s;pect irregular and wrong. But if this be the &s;en&s;e here intended, our author's a&s;&s;ertion will be ab&s;urdly trifling, and no|thing to his purpo&s;e; amounting only to this, take away the whole of the &s;inful action, and no action will remain. And we may as well &s;ay, take away the whole imperfect action of a believer, which as being imperfect is &s;inful, and nothing will remain wherein moral agency is exerci&s;ed. 2. By the &s;in of an action is properly meant that in or belonging to it which is in it&s;elf forbidden, and which con&s;titutes the compound action in that re&s;pect faulty, or inconformable to the law; whether the fault lies in the &s;ub&s;tance of the action, or in it's end, or it's other circum&s;tances, or in all of them. Now if tho&s;e actions which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be enjoined on the unregenerate were contrary to the divine command in every re&s;pect, then indeed it would be true, taking away the &s;in would remove them wholly; and if every thing in them were &s;up|po&s;ed contrary to the command, it would be ab&s;urd ever to make it a que&s;tion whether any thing in them were commanded. But this we deny. Such actions as God has enjoined on the unregenerate are in them|&s;elves good; their &s;infulne&s;s does not lie in the mat|ter, but in the manner of the performance. And if it
<PB N="224" REF="012416_0228_0F89747671962338">
&s;hould be &s;aid that there is no moral agency exerci&s;ed in the matter of the performance, this would be the &s;ame as to &s;ay that there is no morality in the &s;ub&s;tance of external duties; which is demon&s;trably fal&s;e. The morality of an action is nothing el&s;e but it's relation to the divine law commanding or forbidding it; in other words, it's being commanded or forbidden by God. Now it has been proved, and is exceedingly evident from the &s;criptures, nor that I know of ex|pre&s;ly denied by any, that the divine laws extend to the imperate or effective, as well as the immanent acts of the &s;oul. They require a right behaviour, as well as right principles, and affections. Mens outward actions may be contrary to the law, when their de&s;igns are good. And their behaviour may be right, when their ends are not &s;uch as they ought to be. When men perform external duties from natural principles, the &s;infulne&s;s lies in their not having and exerci&s;ing holy principles, rather than in their exerci&s;ing natural principles in &s;uch a manner of behaviour: It lies in not aiming at the end they ought, rather than in aim|ing at an end they ought not to re&s;pect. Con&s;equent|ly the &s;in adhering to &s;uch actions lies in omi&s;&s;ion, rather than commi&s;&s;ion. And it is &s;o far from being true that to take away the &s;in is taking away the acti|on, in the divided &s;en&s;e; that if we take away the action materially good, and leave the &s;ame principles, ends, and other circum&s;tances conjoined with the o|mi&s;&s;ion of it, the &s;in in&s;tead of being taken away or le&s;&s;ened, would be inhanced.</P>
<P>Mr. H. proceeds in the defence of his argument.
<Q>There is a natural connection between requiring the unregenerate to pray, as &s;uch, and requiring them to &s;in.</Q>
Ibid. An&s;w. To require their unregene|racy, and &s;inful exerci&s;es in their prayers, as well as the prayers them&s;elves, would indeed be requiring
<PB N="225" REF="012416_0229_0F89747733144F28">
them to &s;in. The&s;e God does not require. But to require the prayers in them&s;elves, notwith&s;tanding the &s;in with which they will certainly be defiled, while men remain unregenerate, has no connection with the requirement of &s;in, as has been &s;hewn. Be&s;ides, let our author con&s;ider, whether God's requiring chri&s;ti|ans to perform evangelical duties, though imperfect, has a natural connection with his requiring their im|perfection, as well as the duties them&s;elves? Whether his encouraging the unregenerate to u&s;e the means of conver&s;ion, implies or has a natural connection with an encouragement of the &s;infulne&s;s, as well as the u&s;e of means? Whether when him&s;elf advi&s;es to the &s;ame, on &s;uppo&s;ition of a &s;tate of unregeneracy, he really means to advi&s;e to the &s;infulne&s;s as well as to diligent endeavours? May we not hope that a due con&s;iderati|on of the&s;e things may yet lead him out of his mi&s;take?</P>
<P>He adds,
<Q>If the prayers of the wicked are an a|bomination, i. e. wholly &s;inful, then to require them to make &s;uch prayers, is for God to require them to do what is an abomination to him, and wholly &s;inful. And this is the &s;ame, I think, as to require them to &s;in.</Q>
P. 125. We may here return again the &s;ame an&s;wer as before. Prayers and other acts of religious obedience as performed by the unregenerate are, taking in all their circum&s;tances, &s;inful; becau&s;e in &s;ome re&s;pects inconformable to the rule of their duty. And to require &s;uch prayers, in the compound &s;en&s;e, would be requiring the irregular circum&s;tances together with the &s;ub&s;tance of the performance. This God has not done. But the prayers and other reli|gious actions of the unregenerate are &s;ometimes ma|terially and in them&s;elves &s;uch as they ought to be; and al&s;o right in &s;ome of their circum&s;tances. Con|&s;equently, they are not all &s;in, or in every re&s;pect con|trary to the divine law. And to require them to
<PB N="226" REF="012416_0230_0F897477F2DE8D70">
make &s;uch prayers, and perform &s;uch actions, as are right and good for matter, and manner in &s;ome re|&s;pects; though it be certain that in other re&s;pects and circum&s;tances they will be e&s;&s;entially faulty, is infinite|ly different from commanding them to &s;in, as has been often noted.</P>
<P>But he further pleads,
<Q>If it be mens immediate and indi&s;pen&s;able duty to be holy and embrace the go&s;pel, no rea&s;on can be given why this &s;hould not be required of them immediately.</Q>
An&s;w. There is no rea&s;on why all this, and much more, even per|fect obedience to the law, &s;hould not be required of men as their immediate duty. But he adds,
<Q>Or why any thing le&s;s or lower than this &s;hould be required at all.</Q>
Ibid. An&s;w. The wi&s;dom of God has &s;een fit to pre&s;cribe &s;omething le&s;s and lower than a perfect compliance with our whole duty, as the means of obtaining needed ble&s;&s;ings. And we have good rea&s;on for what we do, when we &s;peak as the oracles of God.</P>
<P>Something further is added to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; but I have not ob&s;erved any thing which may be thought to require particular notice, except what has been already &s;poken to &s;omewhere in this e&s;&s;ay.</P>

<HEAD>Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>I Have now in &s;ome manner gone through my pro|po&s;ed undertaking. And upon the whole of our author's performance (&s;o far as it has fallen under pre&s;ent examination) I mu&s;t &s;ay, that it is not the "<HI>metaphy&s;ical,</HI>" that is, as he explains it, the "clo&s;e &s;ound rea&s;oning" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 63.</NOTE> contained in it that has (in my opi|nion) troubled tho&s;e di&s;&s;enting from him on this point.

The words indeed are often hard, but the arguments are &s;oft and yielding enough. His de&s;ign was, I charitably hope, in the main good; viz. to bring &s;in|ners off from a &s;elf-righteous tru&s;t in duties; but he has carried the matter to &s;uch an extreme as, I think, will not abide the te&s;t of &s;cripture and rea&s;on: And &s;o it is to be feared has di&s;&s;erved, and rai&s;ed prejudices again&s;t &s;ome important truths of the go&s;pel, for which he would appear a zealous advocate. However the whole is referred to the candid con&s;ideration and im|partial judgment of tho&s;e who have their &s;en&s;es exer|ci&s;ed to di&s;cern good and evil, and who are di&s;po&s;ed to give every argument, or rea&s;on, it's ju&s;t weight, how incon&s;iderable &s;oever the per&s;on may be who ur|ges it, or however defective his manner. Wi&s;hing that without favour or prejudice, truth may be em|braced, and error rejected; which is all that any one can rea&s;onably de&s;ire who di&s;putes in earne&s;t, and in the integrity of his heart, and not from a mean am|bition of wor&s;ting another in an argument. And may God in his infinite mercy pardon whatever is ami&s;s either in the matter or manner of the&s;e our de|bates, pre&s;erve us from unchri&s;tian animo&s;ities, and uncharitable di&s;affections towards one another, unite chri&s;tians more and more in judgment and heart, keep them from dangerous extremes, cau&s;e truth and ho|line&s;s to prevail, to the abundant edification of the church, and the honour of the glorious go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God, and our Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
