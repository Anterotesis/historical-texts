<L>_WHile from each &s;oul the &s;orrows copious flow,</L>
<L>And weeping Nations heave with mighty woe;</L>
<L>Whil&s;t ev'ry lyre to mournful notes is &s;trung,</L>
<L>And CAROLINA flutters on each tongue:</L>
<L>The mourning Mu&s;e, to con&s;olation deaf,</L>

<L>Oh CAROLINE! Oh Prince&s;s now no more!</L>
<L>Each heart bleeds inward, and all eyes deplore.</L>
<L>Stretch'd pale in death thy lovely limbs are laid,</L>
<L>Thy beauty, <HI>Albion,</HI> and thy joys are fled!</L>
<L>To thee, our tears their filial torrents bring,</L>
