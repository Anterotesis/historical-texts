<P>IN the foregoing Ver&s;e, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> addre&s;&s;eth the Lord with this Reque&s;t, <HI>I be&s;eech thee &s;hew me thy Glory.</HI> Never mere Man &s;ince the Fall in this Life had been honoured with &s;o frequent, intimate and long continued Conver&s;e and Communion with God as <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> like a Man with his Friend, and very lately, for forty Days together without Intermi&s;&s;ion: And yet, at the farthe&s;t Re|move from a &s;urfeiting Satiety, he &s;till earne&s;tly de|&s;ires Acquaintance with God in a higher Mea&s;ure. Whereupon we may Ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>That tho&s;e who are ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;aving Acquain|tance with God and &s;ome Mea&s;ure of &s;piritual Com|munion
<PB N="6" REF="004699_0004_100D86D8085B1960">with him, are coveting &s;till more and more of the Knowledge of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Indeed their De&s;ires after other Objects are hereby in a great Degree &s;uper&s;eded, as appears by the Profe&s;&s;ion of the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 73.25. <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And there is none upon Earth, that I de&s;ire be|&s;ides thee</HI> And of <HI>Paul, Philip.</HI> 3.8. <HI>Yea doubtle&s;s, and I count all Things but Lo&s;s, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us my Lord, for whom I have &s;uffered the Lo&s;s of all Things, and do count them but Dung that I may win Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But their Appetite after more is rai&s;ed by the Ta&s;te they have had of the Sweetne&s;s of Communion with God in Chri&s;t. It's a &s;ad Symptom, that he is whol|ly a Stranger to any &s;aving Acquaintance and Com|munion with God, who hath enough of it and de|&s;ires no more.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Prayer, <HI>I be&s;eech thee &s;hew me thy Glory,</HI> that is, make me to &s;ee thy Glory, make it &s;ome Way or other vi&s;ible to me.</P>
<P>We know <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was not &s;o ignorant as to think that God's proper E&s;&s;ence could be &s;een by bodily Eves; but having hitherto only heard a Voice out of a Pillar of Cloud and Fire, he now de&s;ir'd to &s;ee &s;ome Repre&s;entation of the divine Glory, &s;uch as God might &s;ee fit to gratify him with. Thus much of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Sequel we have God's gracious Reply to his Suit.</P>
<P N="1">1. God in Mercy denies <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> that which was not fit to be granted him, and which even <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf could not have born, ver. 20. <HI>And he &s;aid thou can&s;t not &s;ee my Face, for there &s;hall no Man &s;ee me and live.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004699_0005_100D86DAA8C64738">
Many Times it's be&s;t, we have not in Specie what we a&s;k for. It was be&s;t for <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> that he was &s;o far deny'd. A clear Sight of the Glory of God would quite overpower the Faculties of any mortal Man in the pre&s;ent State. It is in Compa&s;&s;ion to our Frame, that God <HI>holdeth back the Face of his Throne and &s;preadeth a Cloud upon it.</HI> But</P>
<P N="2">2. God grants unto <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> what &s;hall be abun|dantly &s;atisfying. He &s;hall hear what would plea&s;e him, ver. 19. <HI>I will make all my Goodne&s;s pa&s;s before thee, and I will proclaim the Name of the Lord before thee, and will be gracious</HI> &amp;c. as in the Text. This was the be&s;t An&s;wer to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his Reque&s;t. <HI>Shew me thy Glory,</HI> &s;ays he, and God graciou&s;ly an&s;wers by telling him, I will &s;hew thee my Goodne&s;s &amp;c. God's Goodne&s;s is his Glory, and he would have us know him by the Glory of his Mercy, rather than by the Glory of his Maje&s;ty. Now the Height of God's Goodne&s;s even the &s;pecial Glory of it, is the Sovereignty thereof, held forth mo&s;t clearly in our Text.</P>
<P>It's the Glory of the Goodne&s;s of God, that he, as an ab&s;olute Proprietor, makes what Difference he plea&s;es in the Be&s;towment of his Gifts; as not being Debtor nor accountable to any. <HI>May not he do what he will with his own?</HI></P>
<P>It's the Glory of Divine Goodne&s;s, that all his Rea&s;ons of Mercy are fetcht from within him&s;elf, not from any Thing in the Creature which is the de&s;igned Subject of it. As he hath Mercy on whom he will, &s;o it is becau&s;e he will, as our ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us takes Notice, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.26. <HI>Even &s;o Father, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004699_0006_100D86DDECCC0098">
As for the Di&s;plays of divine Wrath, the&s;e are not merely &s;overeign and arbitrary: There is always a Rea&s;on for it found in the Creature. God never &s;ays, I will be angry at whom I will be angry; for his Wrath is always ju&s;t and holy. But he &s;ays, <HI>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious</HI> &amp;c; for his Grace is always free and arbitrary. God never damns by Prerogative, but he always &s;aves by Pre|rogative.</P>
<P>What I &s;hall further offer on this Subject will be in clearing up and applying this</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P>The Mercy of God to any of his &s;inful Creatures hath it's Foundation in and takes it's Ri&s;e from his mere &s;overeign, arbitrary good Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This great and fundamental Doctrine of the Go&s;|pel, becau&s;e it is wholly &s;ubver&s;ive of all carnal De|pendance, we have naturally, through the wretched Pride of our Hearts, a very great and fatal Aver&s;ion to. But it is truly mo&s;t u&s;eful and encouraging to poor Sinners enquiring the Way to <HI>Zion</HI> with their Facesthitherward; as well as mo&s;t refre&s;hingly &s;weet and delightful to tho&s;e, who are bro't &s;avingly home to God in Chri&s;t, and have found him, whom their Souls love, and after whom they have been &s;or|rowing; as may be herein after more particularly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>This Doctrine I &s;hall endeavour to illu&s;trate, by con&s;idering &s;undry In&s;tances of the Grace and Mercy of God towards &s;ome of his &s;inful Creatures, re&s;pect|ing their everla&s;ting Welfare; and ob&s;erve as I pa&s;s along, that the&s;e all have their Foundation in, and
<PB N="9" REF="004699_0007_100D86DF988B8608">take their Ri&s;e from God's mere &s;overeign good Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="1">1. A notable In&s;tance of the adorable Goodne&s;s and Mercy of God is his gracious De&s;ign of the Recovery and Salvation of any of his fallen, &s;inful and mi&s;erable Creatures.</P>
<P>That the glorious God has entertain'd and formed &s;uch a gracious De&s;ign, is not the Thing which I now intend to prove, nor do we need to have it proven to us, who enjoy the Light of the glorious Go&s;pel, and do univer&s;ally a&s;&s;ent to it, as a Point out of all Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>What I am to &s;hew is, that this gracious De&s;ign of God flows from his own mere &s;overeign good Plea&s;ure. This will appear, if we con&s;ider</P>
<P N="1">1. That no Wrong had been done the &s;inful &s;allen Creature, if it had been eternally abandoned unto re|medile&s;s Ruin.</P>
<P>What is &s;trictly a Point of Ju&s;tice is not arbitrary but nece&s;&s;ary; and the Subject is really wronged that is denied any Good, to which it hath a Claim: But there is no Wrong done to the Subject from whom is with-holden only that which he hath no ju&s;t Claim to: Therefore the &s;inful fallen Creature had not been wrong'd, if there never had been any De&s;ign laid for his Recovery and Salvation: Here, <HI>every Mouth mu&s;t be &s;topped and all the</HI> &s;inful <HI>World become guilty before God.</HI> It's therefore apparent, that it's owing only to the &s;overeign good Plea&s;ure of God, that a De&s;ign is laid for the Recovery and Salvation of any &s;inful fallen Creatures. Moreover,</P>
<P N="2">2. God could have recovered his own Glory effec|tually to all Intents and Purpo&s;es, of his &s;inful fallen Creatures, without de&s;igning their Recovery. God
<PB N="10" REF="004699_0008_100D86E4CBD4ABD8">hath indeed made all Things for his own Glory. And he mu&s;t not, nor can he be fru&s;trated of this his End. But he may freely chu&s;e the Way, wherein he will have his Glory of any of his Creatures. It is certain, that God is glorified in the eternal De&s;truc|tion of &s;ome as well as in the eternal Salvation of o|thers. <HI>The Lord is known by the Judgment, which he executeth; the Wicked &s;hall be turned into Hell and all the Nations that forget God, P&s;alm</HI> 9 16, 17.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> plainly tells, that God may and will have his Glory as well in the De&s;truction, as in the Salvation of Sinners, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.22, 23. which read at Lei&s;ure. Yea, the very Goodne&s;s of God had been &s;ufficiently emblazon'd, without &s;uppo&s;ing a De&s;ign of the Recovery and Salvation of any fallen Creatures; I mean his Goodne&s;s in Creation, and his infinite Conde&s;cention in binding him&s;elf in Cove|nant, to reward with an happy Immortality that perfect Obedience, which the intelligent Creature was made capable of yielding, and which God might (if he plea&s;ed) have exacted of him in Right of his own ab&s;olute Sovereignty. Again con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="3">3. God's great End in de&s;igning the Recovery and Salvation of any of his fallen Creatures, is the Mani|fe&s;tation of the Riches of his Grace, as you may &s;ee in <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.4, 5, 6, 7. Now the Glory of Divine Grace con&s;i&s;ts not only in it's being conferred on the unworthy and ill-de&s;erving, nor merely in the Readine&s;s and Willingne&s;s of God in be&s;towing the &s;ame; but al&s;o &s;uppo&s;eth in God a perfect and ab&s;o|lute Liberty on both Sides equally: That is either to grant or with-hold as &s;eems good to him. Take away this ab&s;olute Liberty, as they do who deny the mere Sovereignty of Divine Grace, and you
<PB N="11" REF="004699_0009_100D86E664C9E860">wretchedly ecclip&s;e the Glory of it. Once more here con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="4">4. The De&s;ign of the Recovery of any fallen Crea|tures is by a Surety of God's own providing; which further proves divine Sovereignty to be the Foundati|on and Source of it.</P>
<P>It might perhaps be accounted too bold for us to &s;ay or think, that God could not, in any other Way than by Way of Sureti&s;hip, have provided for the Sinner's Salvation. But this we may venture to &s;ay, <HI>viz.</HI> not only, that this is the only Way, which God hath been plea&s;ed to reveal to us, but al&s;o that we are not capable of conceiving of any other Way con&s;i&s;tent with the Glory and Honour of all the di|vine Attributes. Now it is again&s;t all Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that when the &s;inful Creature had rejected God and thereby ruined him&s;elf, God &s;hould be under any Nece&s;&s;ity of accepting a Ran&s;om offered by another in&s;tead of the Sinner; his Crime being capital: Much le&s;s can God be &s;uppo&s;ed holden, to provide for a Sinner &s;uch a Ran&s;om. The Matter mu&s;t be re&s;olved into the &s;overeign and arbitrary good Plea&s;ure of God.</P>
<P N="2">II. Another In&s;tance of the Mercy of God to|wards fallen Creatures, wherein his Sovereignty is exemplified is this, <HI>viz.</HI> that this merciful De&s;ign of God terminates on Man, exclu&s;ive of the fallen Angels.</P>
<P>That this is the Ca&s;e we all own and mu&s;t do &s;o, if we give Credit to the divine Oracles, wherein this is mo&s;t clearly revealed; therefore I &s;hall not &s;tay to prove it: But pa&s;s on to &s;hew, that we have here in this In&s;tance a clear Proof of the ab&s;olute Sovereignty of Divine Grace. Here con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="12" REF="004699_0010_100D86EA31EEB700">
1. There is Nothing in Man conceivable, which is not to be found in the &s;inning Angels, which might make Man rather cho&s;en for a Subject of Mercy than Devils. Are the Devils de&s;erving God's Wrath and Cur&s;e forever for Rebellion and Enmity again&s;t God? So is Man.</P>
<P>And if any &s;uppo&s;e, that mere Mi&s;ery it&s;elf does in &s;ome Re&s;pects, recommend the Subject to Mercy; it mu&s;t be allowed, that Devils, in this Regard, &s;tand as fair Candidates for Mercy as Men, if not fairer; for they are doubtle&s;s as mi&s;erable and as &s;en&s;ibly &s;o as Men are, excepting only that they have not this to reflect upon, as Go&s;pel Sinners have, that they have rejected tendered Salvation.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;ery of the Creature may be be con&s;ider|ed as the Object, but not as the fir&s;t Motive of divine Mercy.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Glory of divine Grace would have as much appeared in the Salvation of Devils as of Men. It's &s;o clear that there needs not a Word to be &s;aid in it's Confirmation.</P>
<P N="3">3. Carnal Men have the very &s;ame Pride, Enmity and Antipathy again&s;t the Way of Salvation which God hath provided, until it be &s;lain by the mighty Power of God, as Devils them&s;elves can be &s;uppo|&s;ed to have. The Apo&s;tle tells us, Rom. 8.7. <HI>The carnal Mind is Enmity again&s;t God, &amp;c.</HI> And God could have de&s;igned and effected a Conque&s;t over the Enmity of Devils, as well as of Men. Yea,</P>
<P N="4">4. What Odds their appears betwixt &s;inful Angels and &s;inful Men would have led us, rather to have thought them the more likely Objects of de&s;igned Mercy, than Men; by Rea&s;on of the Superiority of their natural Capacity for the Service and Glory of
<PB N="13" REF="004699_0011_100D875B68B2BB50">God; had they been recovered to Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">III. The Sovereignty of God is di&s;covered in this, <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;ome, not all of the &s;inful human Race are the de&s;igned Subjects of Recovery and Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It's certain, that &s;ome only, and not all of the Individuals of Mankind are the de&s;igned Subjects of this Recovery. We all readily yield that this Recovery does not in Fact take Place in the Ca&s;e of all, but of &s;ome only; upon which it will follow, that it was not de&s;igned for all, but for &s;ome only: Unle&s;s we &s;upop&s;e (what is mo&s;t ab&s;urd) that God may be fru&s;trated of his own De&s;ign and Pur|po&s;e. Now, what Rea&s;on for this can we give, &s;aving the mere Sovereignty of divine Grace? Sure none at all. For,</P>
<P N="1">I. The Remedy provided is of Value enough for the Recovery and Salvation of all, were the Number a Million Times as great as it is. What is &s;ufficient for any One mu&s;t be of an infinite Value: And what is infinite is &s;ufficient for all. The Apo&s;tle, &s;peaking of Chri&s;t, &s;ays, Col. 1.16. <HI>It plea&s;eth the Father, that in him &s;hould all Fulne&s;s dwell.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It was not nece&s;&s;ary for the Honour of God's vindictive Ju&s;tice, that &s;ome &s;hould be &s;ecluded from, when others are admitted to partake in the de&s;ign|ed Recovery by Je&s;us Chri&s;t: for Divine Ju&s;tice and Vengeance never &s;at in &s;uch Triumph as on the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. If all as well as any had been the de&s;igned Sub|jects of this Recovery by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Mercy of God would have had &s;o many more everla&s;ting Mo|numents.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="14" REF="004699_0012_100D875CF8136860">
4. All are alike involv'd in Guilt, expo&s;ed to the Wrath of God and tremendous Cur&s;es of the Law; and alike naturally indi&s;po&s;ed to accept of the Reme|dy provided. This Ca&s;e therefore mu&s;t be re&s;olved into divine Sovereignty.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That only &s;ome of the Children of Men en|joy the external Means of Grace and Salvation is owing to God's mere &s;overeign good Plea&s;ure. You know this is Fact, &s;ome only, exclu&s;ive of others, enjoy the outward Means of Grace and Salvation. This was for many Ages the peculiar Privilege of the I&s;raelites, exclu&s;ive of all other Nations, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 147. 19, 20. And now its the di&s;tingui&s;hing Priviledge of the Chri&s;tian Nations, not common to all Man|kind. This flows from the mere arbitrary good Plea&s;ure of God: As <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the Name of God a&s;&s;ures the I&s;raelites, that they might not vaunt them|&s;elves, <HI>Deut.</HI> 7.6, 7, 8. And as our Saviour a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.25, 26. <HI>I thank thee, O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e Things from the Wi&s;e and Prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them unto Babes: even &s;o, Father, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. That only &s;ome are awakened, convinced and converted by the Mini&s;try of the Word; when others enjoying the &s;ame or the like outward Advan|tages and Helps are never the better therefor, ari&s;es from God's arbitrary and &s;overeign good Plea&s;ure. At the &s;ame Time when <HI>Lydia's Heart was opened, that &s;he attended to the Things &s;poken by Paul,</HI> in a &s;ound Conver&s;ion; there were many others pre&s;ent, who probably were not at all wrought upon for their good, <HI>Acts</HI> 16.13, 14. Of <HI>Peter</HI>'s Hearers there
<PB N="15" REF="004699_0013_100D8822915057B0">were Three Thou&s;and converted by one rowzing Sermon, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.14&mdash;41. But of <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Hearers we don't know that there was &s;o much as one con|verted by his Sermon, very much of the &s;ame Kind and Tendency with the former: The&s;e, in&s;tead of kindly Convictions, were filled with a blood-thir&s;ty Rage again&s;t their faithful Reprover, <HI>Acts</HI> 7.54 &amp;c. <HI>Felix</HI> met with a Shock of Conviction that &s;et him a trembling, <HI>Acts</HI> 24.25. as well as the Jaylor, <HI>Acts</HI> 16.29. of which one only i&s;&s;ued in Conver&s;ion. Thus it hath been in all Ages and Places of Chri&s;|tianity, to the pre&s;ent: And perhaps there has &s;carcely ever been a Period, &s;ince the Apo&s;tolick Age, wherein hath been more con&s;picuous than in the pre&s;ent Day, what the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> ob&s;erved in his Time, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.15, 16. <HI>We are unto God a &s;weet Savour of Chri&s;t, in them that are &s;aved, and in them that peri&s;h: To the one we are a Savour of Death unto Death, and to the other a Savour of Life unto Life.</HI> Now whence comes this Difference? Is it becau&s;e of &s;omething di&s;tingui&s;hingly found in &s;ome to recommend <HI>them</HI> to God above <HI>other?</HI> No, no. Tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hingly favoured with &s;aving Grace, under the &s;ame Means which evidently prove hardning to others, mu&s;t and will a&s;&s;ign it to meer fovereign Grace. <HI>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that &s;heweth Mercy, Rom.</HI> 9.16. Although we are to <HI>work out our own Salvation with Fear and Trem|bling;</HI> Yet we are to know, that it is <HI>God that wor|keth in us to will and to do of his own good Plea&s;ure,</HI> Philip. 2.12, 13.</P>
<P>Having thus illu&s;trated and confirmed the Doctrine, I proceed to the</P>

<P>USE I. Hence infer, that its a great Mi&s;take and of very dangerous Con&s;equence, which many carnal Per&s;ons under the Go&s;pel fall into, who will per&s;wade them&s;elves, that they are able (with the common Concurrence of divine Providence in upholding their Beings and Faculties) to do that which hath a certain Connection with, or which &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly i&s;&s;ue in their Conver&s;ion and eternal Salvation. By Conver&s;ation with &s;undry Per&s;ons con&s;iderably concern'd for their Souls, I find this Mi&s;take is inbibed and deeply rooted; and it may be &s;o in many more than I am aware of. I believe, that upon Inquiry mo&s;t of you if not all, will at once readily own, and think you do it &s;incere|ly too; that you have never done nor can do any Thing, which is properly meritorious of Grace and Glory, as Labours are of Wages. No, your Hope is in Chri&s;t and in him alone. But yet you &s;ecretly think, that you either have done, or can and will do that which hath a &s;ure Connection with your &s;piritual and eternal Welfare. You will own, you can't repent of your Sins &s;avingly in your own Strength, can't turn your <HI>Heart of Stone into an Heart of Fle&s;h,</HI> can't believe in Chri&s;t to the &s;aving of your Souls, can't convert your &s;elves <HI>from Darkne&s;s to Light, from the Power of Satan unto God.</HI> But yet you may imagine your &s;elves able to do that, which &s;hall certainly i&s;&s;ue in this happy Change. This is a great Mi&s;take ari&s;ing principally from a Mi&s;under&s;tanding of the Promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel, as to the Subjects there|of: &s;uch as we have in <HI>Ezck.</HI> 36.25, 26 <HI>&amp;c.</HI> com|pared with <HI>ver.</HI> 37. and in <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.7. and in <HI>Luke</HI> 11.13.</P>
<P>Now Per&s;ons in a carnal State, many of them, are ready to entertain a Thought, that by their own
<PB N="17" REF="004699_0015_100D882878860438">Doings (tho' they can't properly merit, yet) they are in&s;ured of &s;piritual and &s;aving Mercies, by Virtue of the&s;e and &s;uch like Promi&s;es, which God hath made them in his Word. But this is all a Mi&s;take; for no gracele&s;s Per&s;on hath any Claim to one Pro|mi&s;e of &s;aving Mercies in the whole Book of God. It's too hard a &s;aying for many to patiently bear, but it's true. The gracious Promi&s;es are Children's Bread, they are the peculiar Inheritance of tho&s;e who, by a &s;aving Faith, are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and Chri&s;tle&s;s Souls have no Intere&s;t in them; For the Apo&s;tle tells us, that <HI>all the Promi&s;es of God in Chri&s;t are yea, and in him Amen to the Glory of God by us,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.20. And if &s;o, What claim have chri&s;tle&s;s Sinners to the Promi&s;es? If God be a Sovereign De&s;pen&s;er of his &s;aving Graces and Favours and may grant or with|hold them according to his mere good Plea&s;ure, as I have endeavour'd before to &s;hew; then Sinners in their natural State have no Claim to the Promi&s;es: For if God had once bound him&s;elf by his Promi&s;e to any of his Creatures; he is no more at perfect Liberty either to grant or with-hold the promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ings, as may plea&s;e him; but inviolably holden by his Promi&s;e, and it were not ju&s;t in God to with|hold the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Let me here &s;hew Sinners in &s;undry Particulars (at lea&s;t &s;omething of the) Greatne&s;s and Danger of this Mi&s;take, which I am &s;peaking of.</P>
<P N="1">1. It mu&s;t be very dangerous for Sinners &s;till to &s;tick fa&s;t on the fir&s;t Covenant, the Covenant of Works; becau&s;e that being once broken, there is no Claim to be made by Virtue of it, to any Thing el&s;e but the Cur&s;es of it. By Virtue of that Cove|nant whil&s;t yet unbroken, Man by his own Doings might have certainly entitled him&s;elf to God's Fa|vour
<PB N="18" REF="004699_0016_100D882A2C3CFB50">and everla&s;ting Happine&s;s. But, how? Why, merely by Virtue of God's Covenant Promi&s;e. No Man can ever imagine, that the Obedience required of Man at fir&s;t, &amp; particularly in that determining Point, <HI>viz.</HI> his refraining to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, could have any Thing at all of ab|&s;olute or proper Merit in the Nature of it; much le&s;s in any Mea&s;ure equivalent to the Ble&s;&s;ings, he would have reaped thereby, had he been obedient; as painful Labours for another are of a Merit equiva|lent to the &s;tipulated Wages. Now for a poor Sin|ner to per&s;wade him&s;elf, upon what he has done or can do, that he hath a good Claim to converting and &s;aving Mercies by Vertue of the Promi&s;es, is nothing more or le&s;s, than to &s;tand to this Moment on the Foot of a Covenant of Works, as really in the E&s;&s;entials of it as ever Man in the Beginning did: And the unhappy Creature is all this while going about to e&s;tabli&s;h a Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own, of the &s;ame Kind with the Righteou&s;ne&s;s required under the fir&s;t Covenant, which con&s;i&s;ted in a Compliance with the Condition, on which an happy Immortality was then promi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2">2. To &s;uppo&s;e that a Sinner in his natural State doth or can do that which will entitle him to the Pro|mi&s;es of Grace and Salvation, is quite incon&s;i&s;tent with and contrary to the whole Tenor and main De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel, which is perfectly to exclude all Boa&s;t|ing in and of our &s;elves, and to lay the Crown of our Salvation on the Head of rich, free and &s;overeign Grace thro' Chri&s;t Je&s;us. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.27.</P>
<P N="3">3. To &s;uppo&s;e that a Sinner by any Thing he can do, may claim the Promi&s;es, hath a direct Tendency to render. Grace and Glory cheap and contemptible, and to harden Sinners in their Neglect thereof. It's
<PB N="19" REF="004699_0017_100D882DC35FA5C0">very apparent that many under the Go&s;pel think, that the attaining of a &s;aving Faith in Chri&s;t and Repen|tance unto Life, is nothing &s;o difficult and hazardous as &s;ome repre&s;ent it to be; and that they need not be &s;o very &s;peedy and earne&s;t in the Que&s;t thereof as &s;ome would have them to be. Now one great cau&s;e is this &s;ad Mi&s;take we are &s;peaking of. They think that the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, with all others depending there|upon, are &s;ecured to them in the Promi&s;es: It is but &s;eeking for them in Sincerity, which, they &s;uppo&s;e they can do at any Time and they &s;hall certainly find, for God hath promi&s;ed them; this makes them carele&s;s and dilatory to their Ruin.</P>
<P>On the contrary, it's apparent, that a due Sen&s;e of divine Sovereignty in the Di&s;pen&s;ations of Grace, hath a happy Tendency to invigorate our Pur&s;uits thereof: if there be any Pertinence in the Apo&s;tle's Talk, <HI>Philip.</HI> 2.12, 23. <HI>Work out your own Salva|tion with Fear and Trembling; for it is God which worketh in you to Will and to do of his good Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. If it were po&s;&s;ible for Per&s;ons continuing under this Mi&s;take which I am &s;peaking of, yet to become Subjects of &s;pecial Grace here, and Glory hereafter; I can't conceive how it's po&s;&s;ible for them to ta&s;te a tenth (I was going to &s;ay a thou&s;andth) Part of the Sweetne&s;s thereof. O, it's the Sovereignty and ab|&s;olute Freene&s;s of Divine Grace to us (who might have been ju&s;tly aband oned to eternal Ruin as well as others after our utmo&s;t Efforts) which makes it &s;o ra|vi&s;hingly delightful unto our Souls. To this you can all in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure witne&s;s, who have (as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.3.) <HI>ta&s;ted that the Lord is gracious.</HI></P>
<P>That which &s;hews <HI>the exceeding Riches of his Grace in his Kindne&s;s toward us, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is
<PB N="20" REF="004699_0018_100D883031EF0908">this, viz, <HI>that by Grace we are &s;aved through Faith, and that not of our &s;elves, it is the Gift of God, not of Works lea&s;t any Man &s;hould boa&s;t. Eph.</HI> 3.7, 8, 9.</P>
<P N="5">5. To what hath been offered, I &s;hall only add this one Con&s;ideration farther under this Head <HI>viz.</HI> that Converts, who have at fir&s;t &s;ought regenerating and &s;aving Grace under this Notion, that the Promi|&s;es of God &s;ecure the &s;ame to them, on Condition of their own faithful Endeavours in Que&s;t thereof, have been obliged after all their vain Struggles on this Foot, at la&s;t to lie down at the Foot of divine Sovereignty and acknowledge that if they peri&s;h at la&s;t, notwith|&s;tanding what they have done, God would remain per|fectly ju&s;t, holy and true, and they ju&s;tly mi&s;erable to Eternity: And that if ever they are &s;aved, it mu&s;t be from the mere and unpromi&s;ed Mercy of God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>That you may all more clearly &s;ee this Truth; &s;uppo&s;e the Matter were laid down in Form of a ca|tegorick Syllogi&s;m thus,</P>
<P>Every adult Per&s;on of common Under&s;tanding un|der the Light of the Go&s;pel, who duly improves him|&s;elf in &s;eeking Regeneration and Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is a&s;&s;ured by the Promi&s;es of God, that he &s;hall obtain the &s;ame: But I do &s;o improve my&s;elf: Therefore I may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of this, that I &s;hall cer|tainly obtain.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Propo&s;ition is, that every adult Per&s;on of common Under&s;tanding under the Light of the Go&s;|pel, who duly improves him&s;elf in &s;eeking Regene|ration and Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is a&s;&s;ured by the Promi&s;es of God, that he &s;mall obtain the &s;ame. This Men are naturally very fond of, and accordingly the Sinner under his fir&s;t Concern for his Soul and Eter|nity,
<PB N="21" REF="004699_0019_100D8832B55E0490">goes to Work to do &s;omething, that may (on this Foot) give him a Claim to converting Grace, and will be di&s;turbed, if a Mini&s;ter tells him plainly that the&s;e his Labours are vain on this Suppo&s;ition which he goes upon. Let what will be &s;aid on the other Side of the Que&s;tion, the Sinner under his fir&s;t Awakenings, through the reigning Pride of his Heart &s;corning to come quite empty handed, will endeavor and think to obtain &s;omething, by his own Indu&s;try with the common Concurrence of divine Providence in upholding his Being and Faculties, that &s;hall en|tile him at lea&s;t to a Promi&s;e of converting Grace. Sundry of you who now hear me and who are hope|fully converted, can (I believe) by your own Experi|ence atte&s;t to the Truth of this. But now I appeal to you: Say in the Pre&s;ence and in the Fear of God, who &s;earcheth the Hearts and trieth the Reins of the Children of Men as well as their Ways; can any one &s;ingle Per&s;on among you with a good Con|&s;cience a&s;&s;ume and &s;ay, as in the &s;econd Propo&s;ition? I have duly improved my &s;elf in &s;eeking regenerating Grace and Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t: I have gone as far as po&s;&s;ibly I could, without renewing Grace in the Reformation of what I know has been ami&s;s in Point of Omi&s;&s;ions and Commi&s;&s;ions, in the clo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t &s;trict Meditation, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t, vehe|ment and &s;teadily per&s;evering Importunity in Prayer|fulne&s;s <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If any of you my Hearers, upon &s;uch a Challenge, will venture to a&s;&s;ume po&s;itively for your &s;elves; I may venture, without the Breach of Chari|ty to &s;ay of you; that you are bold as blind Bayard, and therefore bold becau&s;e &s;tark blind. Every &s;en&s;i|ble and experienced Chri&s;tian will (upon his longe&s;t Trials this Way) be con&s;train'd to own; Alas for me! I have been &s;adly deficient in my Improvements
<PB N="22" REF="004699_0020_100D8834955F0DD8">of common Gifts and Advantages; I might have done very much more and better than I have done, without &s;pecial renewing Grace. You my Friends who have experienc'd a &s;aving Change (I am moral|ly a&s;&s;ured) will, upon a &s;erious Reflection, find your &s;elves obliged to own this, that after all your vain Struggles again&s;t it, you have been compell'd to make your dernier Re&s;ort to, and fall down at the Foot of divine Sovereignty, and &s;ub&s;cribe to that in Rom. 9. 18. <HI>Therefore hath he Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he hardneth.</HI></P>
<P>USE II. Of Caution. I would in the Name and Fear of God &s;olemnly warn and caution my &s;elf and all that hear me, again&s;t the dreadful Abu&s;e of the Doctrine of the Sovereignty of Divine Grace, to the a&s;certaining our eternal Ruin. Our Text and Doc|trine pre&s;ent us with one of the mo&s;t beautiful &s;weet and refre&s;hing Flowers of Paradi&s;e. But as a Spider or Serpent may extract the mo&s;t deadly Poi&s;on from the &s;ame Flower out of which the Bee &s;ucks the riche&s;t and &s;weete&s;t Honey; &s;o it is with any preci|ous Truth of the Go&s;pel, and this in particular: While it is improved by &s;ome to their everla&s;ting Be|nefit, it's abu&s;ed by others to their con&s;ummate Ruin. Let us then be caution'd again&s;t the Abu&s;e of this Doctrine, either in ju&s;tifying or in any Mea|&s;ure excu&s;ing and apologizing for our own Negligence or Indolence, in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our &s;piritual and e|ternal Salvation. Some will &s;ay, if I was verily per|&s;waded, that God's Mercy flows only from his mere Sovereignty, and that I have no Promi&s;e of convert|ing and &s;aving Grace on my own &s;incere Endeavours; I would never incline an Ear, nor move an Hand or Foot or Tongue or Thought in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of my
<PB N="23" REF="004699_0021_100D88369AD2D628">Salvation, but lazily wait the Event of God's &s;ove|reign Plea&s;ure concerning me. Many Sinners there are who talk at this Rate; &s;ome, with a De&s;ign to ridicule the Doctrine of the Sovereignty of Divine Grace, as an ab&s;urd Doctrine: To the&s;e I &s;hall &s;ay Nothing more now, than advi&s;e them &s;etiou&s;ly and prayerfully to ead the ninth Chapter of Romans and when they have thus read it, let them immedi|ately give up their Cau&s;e, or find Bra&s;s enough to brand the divinely in&s;pired Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> as the Athe|nian Philo&s;ophers did) for a vain and ridiculous Bab|ler. Other Sinners there are who allow the Doc|trine of the Sovereignty of Divine Grace to be true and certain; who yet wretchedly pervert the &s;ame to their Ruin, or are in great Danger of; by excu|&s;ing them&s;elves in the Neglect of utmo&s;t Painfulne&s;s, Prayerfulne&s;s and Per&s;everance in the U&s;e of all the Means of Grace and Salvation. Now for the Caution of &s;uch I recommend the&s;e following Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. If you neglect or become remi&s;s or &s;uperficial in your Prayers and the U&s;e of all or any other Means of Grace and Salvation which you are favoured with; you run directly counter to the divine Commands, and thereby take the ready Cour&s;e to en&s;ure Damnation to your &s;elves. Nothing in the Scriptures is plainer, than that Sinners are enjoin'd by God's preceptive Will, to do that which al&s;o the innate Principle of Self-Love well regulated will excite them to, <HI>viz.</HI> that they exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t in all Reli|gious Duties, in pur&s;uing and endeavouring to &s;ecure their &s;piritual and eternal Well-Being. The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath commanded Sinners to exert them|&s;elves to the utmo&s;t in Que&s;t of Grace here and Glo|ry hereafter. Thus he hath done with his own Mouth
<PB N="24" REF="004699_0022_100DBB4C80BFBDF0">while bodily pre&s;ent here on Earth, <HI>Luke</HI> 13.24. <HI>Strive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate. John</HI> 6.27, <HI>Labour for that Meat which endureth to everla&s;ting Life, which the Son of Man &s;hall give unto you.</HI> And thus did he afterwards by his Spirit in the Mouths and Pens of his Apo&s;tles, <HI>Philip.</HI> 2.12. <HI>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</HI> 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10. <HI>Give Diligence to make your Calling and Election &s;ure.</HI> Then con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="2">2. God loo&s;eth not his Authority to command, tho' Sinners have forfeited any Claim to the Promi&s;es. It mu&s;t indeed be conceded, that if there were no other Relation betwixt two Parties, than that which is properly foederal, or a Covenant Relation, wherein the Parties are no otherwi&s;e obliged to each other than by Compact: In this Ca&s;e, if either of the Parties once in Covenant with the other (tho' it be by his own Default) forfeits any Claim of the other, he is not any longer holden to the other, any farther than to &s;uffer the Penalty or Breach of Covenant. But if a Superiour, as a King, Parent or Ma&s;ter &s;hould &s;ee Cau&s;e to covenant with his inferior Correlate, and the inferior &s;hould, by his own Default, cut him&s;elf off from claiming any Benefit by that Covenant; this can do Nothing towards di&s;&s;olving the native or ori|ginal Authority of the Superior. So in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, if Sinners have forfeited any Claim to a Pro|mi&s;e, this can't di&s;&s;olve their native Obligation to Obedience.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is an Argumont of a &s;ordid mercenary Spirit, that we will not do our Duty, without being fir&s;t a&s;&s;ur'd of Wages for it. What? Will we not take any Pains in the Pro&s;ecution of a Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch va&s;t Importance as that of Grace here and Glo|ry hereafter, on any other Condition than that of
<PB N="25" REF="004699_0023_100DBB4E37D1D350">God's a&s;&s;uring us beforehand by his Promi&s;e, that we &s;hall certainly &s;ucceed? How &s;ordid &amp; ba&s;e were this? See how it looks in the In&s;tance of a poor &s;tarv'd pe|ri&s;hing Beggar. He is directed to apply for Relief to &s;ome noble wealthy, generous Per&s;onage, who is able to help, and who hath of his mere Genero&s;ity relieved Multitudes under &s;uch Circum&s;tances: But now the &s;turdy Beggar replies, not I, I will not &s;tir a Foot towards him, unle&s;s I have fir&s;t &s;uch a Pro|mi&s;e of him, that it &s;hall not remain at his mere Plea&s;ure to give or with-hold needed Supplies: I will not go except I may upon his Word fir&s;t given, boldly challenge at his Hands what I want. In this Ca&s;e your Indignation again&s;t the &s;ordid Wretch would ri&s;e to &s;uch a Degree, as that you would be provok'd to &s;ay of him; e'en &s;et him then die and rot on the Dunghill, if he be &s;o proud and &s;tout. Now in Application of this Simile, I may &s;ay to thee, Sinner! who&s;oever thou art, that thus abu&s;e&s;t the Doctrine of the Sovereignty of divine Grace in Manner a before&s;aid, as <HI>Nathan</HI> to <HI>David</HI> in the Ap|plication of his Parable, thou art the Man or Woman; and would to God, it might have as good Effect.</P>
<P>Again con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="4">4. God hath many a Time heard the Prayers even of carnal Per&s;ons, of his mere Sovereignty, though he hath never before a&s;&s;ured them Audience by any expre&s;s Promi&s;e, e&s;pecially on their Per&s;everance and encrea&s;ing Importunity; that is to &s;ay, he hath gra|ciou&s;ly granted the Ble&s;&s;ings thus a&s;kt in Praver for the Matter of it agreeable with his Will, although the Sins attending the &s;ame, ari&s;ing from a wrong Principle and End, were more than enough to ju&s;tify God in the Rejection of the Suppliant with Abhor|rence. We have a very remarkable Exemplification
<PB N="26" REF="004699_0024_100DBB5093628E10">of this in the Ca&s;e of the Woman of Canaan, recor|ded in Mat. 15.22. &amp;c.

And this is the Ca&s;e with almo&s;t all who have been converted in adult Age; their Prayers whil&s;t unconverted have been heard and graciou&s;ly an&s;wered, in the Be&s;tow|ment of converting Grace, when once they have beeh fully brought to di&s;claim any Challenge hereof at the Hands of God, and freely acknowledge that he may either grant or with-hold the &s;ame as &s;eems good to him. I believe, the Sinner mu&s;t be made &s;en&s;ible that God is not a Debtor to him by his Pro|mi&s;e or any other Way, before he is prepared to re|ceive &s;pecial Grace.</P>
<P>And I can't but think, that a principal Rea&s;on why Sinners pray in vain for a long Time and with con|&s;iderable Earne&s;tne&s;s for regenerating Grace, and find them&s;elves as far off as ever, is becau&s;e they do all un|der a Notion that God is at lea&s;t by his Prom&s;e a Debtor to them.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="004699_0025_100DBB52D2DB2DD0">
Poor Sinner yet in vain &s;eeking converting Grace! be prevailed upon to drop any &s;uch Preten&s;ions, if you would ever obtain the Mercy you need, and freely acknowledge that God may ju&s;tly grant or with-hold the Mercy, you need, as &s;eems good to him.

Now my dear Friends, &s;top a Minute here, and con&s;ider how incon&s;i&s;tent &s;uch Talk or Thoughts are. Can you &s;uppo&s;e it con&s;i&s;tent with Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s for any one to break his Promi&s;e to another? Indeed of the Condition of a Promi&s;e bears no Proportion in Value to the Good promi&s;ed on that Condition; as if a Man &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly and bona Fide promi&s;e me an E&s;tate of an hundred a Year, on the Condition of a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">pe of Tobacco every New-Year's Day; In &s;uch a Ca&s;e the Per&s;on can't be &s;uppo&s;ed under any previ|ous Obligation in Point of Ju&s;tice ever to make &s;uch a Promi&s;e: And the making of the Promi&s;e is an Act of mere Grace: Yet when he hath once &s;o|lemnly promi&s;ed and engaged, he is as really holden in Point of Ju&s;tice to perform his Promi&s;e, as if the Condition was of an equavalent Value. But to pro|ceed, con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="5">5. Though a gracele&s;s Sinner hath no Claim to a Promi&s;e of converting Grace, yet the Promi&s;es of this Nature in the Go&s;pel afford unto Sinners great Ground of Encouragement in &s;eeking Conver&s;ion, and for this Purpo&s;e may be and are ju&s;tly improved by wi&s;e and godly Divines, for the Quickning of

Such gracious Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture &s;o far as they re&s;er to the unconverted; I look upon as &s;o many Predictions or Prophe&s;ies of what the Lord de&s;igns, and will in his own Time and Way graciou&s;ly accompli&s;h, though none can beforehand ordinarily know in partieular the de&s;igned Subjects.

Let us for Example take a View of what we have in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.25. &amp;c. <HI>Then will I &s;prinkle clean Water upon you, and ye &s;hall be clean&mdash;a new Heart al&s;o will I give you</HI> &amp;c. compared with <HI>v.</HI> 37. <HI>I will yet for this be inquired of by the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do it for them.</HI> Now if we con&s;ider the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages as containing a Promi&s;e of regenerating Grace made to Sinners on a Condition to be performed by them; here the awaken'd Sinner will be for ever re&s;tle&s;s, con|&s;cious of his own Failure as to his Compliance with the Condition, But if we con&s;ider the&s;e Things as a Prediction or prophetical Declaration of God's gra|cious Purpo&s;es towards Sinners, including therein, not only the main End and De&s;ign, but al&s;o the Means leading thereunto: Here the Sinner finding in him&s;elf this gracious Purpo&s;e of God operating tho' in the &s;malle&s;t Deginnings, of what is only preli|minary or preparatory to Conver&s;ion, doth entertain withal a beginning Hope: And as it progre&s;&s;ive|ly operates from one Step to another, &s;o the Grounds of Encouragement are &s;till ri&s;ing; becau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> this Light he views the whole Work, from the

In the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture the Sinner may for his Encouragement, &s;ee the Exhibitation of the gracious Purpo&s;e of God, his almighty Power and infinite Goodne&s;s in the Conver&s;ion and Salvation of the wor&s;t of Sinners; and &s;o be a&s;&s;ured of the Po&s;&s;ibility of his own Conver&s;ion: Which then ri&s;eth into &s;ome Pro|bability, when he finds (in Pur&s;uance of &s;uch a graci|ous De&s;ign) an Heart given to &s;eek regenerating Grace; and the more earne&s;t and per&s;evering he is help'd to be, the higher the probability &s;till ri&s;es, be|cau&s;e the whole is in the Hand of an infinitely wife gracious and mighty Efficient: And what more can be expected or de&s;ired? Once more con&s;ider.</P>
<P N="6">6. By your Neglect of Prayerfulne&s;s, Painfulne&s;s and Per&s;everance in Que&s;t of Grace and Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, you take the ready Cour&s;e to cut your &s;elves off from all Hopes of obtaining. It's agreed on all Hands, not only by tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;e, that the Sinner is &s;ecured of &s;aving Mercies, by the Pro|mi&s;es of God, on Condition of his hone&s;tly exerting him&s;elf in proper Endeavours therefor; but al&s;o by tho&s;e who know that &s;aving Mercies take their Ri&s;e from God's mere good Plea&s;ure, as before held forth in this Di&s;cour&s;e: I &s;ay it's univer&s;ally agreed, that the carele&s;s negligent Sinner, continuing &s;o, hath no Ground at all to hope that he &s;hall ever be &s;aved.</P>
<P>What then do&s;t thou mean poor Sinner, who art &s;triving (not to enter in at the &s;trait Gate, but) to ju&s;tify or at lea&s;t excu&s;e thy Neglect of &s;eeking the great Salvation exhibited in the Go&s;pel, by &s;uch a wretched perverting of the precious Doctrine of the Sovereignty of Divine Grace? What a Madne&s;s is

<P>USE <HI>III.</HI> Hence learn, that the very wor&s;t of Sin|ners in this World, under Go&s;pel Advantages are not excluded Hopes of obtaining &s;aving Mercies at the Hands of God, on the Account of either the Greatne&s;s or Number, or aggravating Circum&s;tances of their Sins, or their long Continuance hitherto in a State and Cour&s;e of Sin. Satan that grand Enemy of Souls, always &s;eeking whom he may devour, rocks the Cra|dle and keeps the Sinner fa&s;t a&s;leep in carnal Security and Indolence, as long as po&s;&s;ibly he can; and would be glad to have him &s;leep on and take his Re&s;t, till he be awakned with the Flames of Hell about his Ears. If the Sinner meet with &s;omething in the Mini&s;try of Divine Ordinances or Providences, that gives him a little Di&s;re&s;t for a &s;hort Time; Satan is watchful to quiet him again a&s;&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible be|fore he is throughly awakened; by Sugge&s;ting to him, either that his Sins that trouble him are &s;mall, mere Peccadilloes, what the be&s;t of Men are liable to, and yet in a &s;afe E&s;tate, being no more than common Frailties which are overlookt of Cour&s;e; or

But &s;ometimes the&s;e Artifices of Satan for keeping the Sinner a&s;leep, or getting him to &s;leep a|gain, when he begins to make a Stir, prove not effec|tual for this Purpo&s;e: Now the Devil changes &s;hape and acts the Part of a roaring Lyon, when his &s;erpentine Wiles fail him. He now tells the rowzed Sinner, your Ca&s;e is de&s;perate; your Sins are &s;o many, &s;o great in them&s;elves, &s;o highly aggravated and &s;o long continued in, that it is in vain for you to hope for Mercy; and its be&s;t for you to take what &s;en|&s;ual Plea&s;ures you can in this World. It is from &s;uch Sugge&s;tions of the Devil that Sinners &s;ay practically as in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 22.13, <HI>Let us cat and drink for to-morrow we &s;hall die;</HI> and as in <HI>Jer.</HI> 18.12, <HI>There is no Hope, but we will walk after our own Devices, and we will every one do the Imagination of his evil Heart.</HI> God of his Infinite Mercy grant, that none of us may be &s;o ignorant of Satan's Devices, that he may get this Advantage at la&s;t of us to con&s;ummate our Ruin! Poor di&s;tre&s;t and di&s;con&s;olate Sinner! art thou ju&s;t ready to conclude de&s;perately again&s;t thy &s;elf, that there is no hope or Help for thee in God, but that thou mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h everla&s;tingly; becau&s;e thy Sins are for Size like the Mountains of the Earth, and for Number like the Sands on the Shore, attended with the mo&s;t aggravating Circum&s;tances, and long per&s;i&s;ted in? Know thou, that it is the Devil the Fa|ther
<PB N="32" REF="004699_0030_100DBB5EA210BBD0">of Lyes, who prompts thee to draw this fal&s;e Con|clu&s;ion, tho' from true Premi&s;es. Think of the greatne&s;s, the Number and aggravating Circum&s;tances of thy Sins as much as thou wilt, the more the bet|ter: But withal think of the Sovereignty of Divine Grace thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Never was one Sinner &s;ince the Fall of <HI>Adam</HI> therefore converted, pardoned and &s;aved, becau&s;e he was (antecedent to the Im|pre&s;&s;ions of Divine Grace on his Soul) better than another, or le&s;s Criminal than another, but becau&s;e God <HI>will be gracious to whom he will be gracious, and will &s;hew Mercy to whom he will &s;hew Mercy</HI></P>
<P>The Con&s;ideration of the Sovereignty of Divine Grace is infinitely more encouraging than di&s;couraging to all who &s;hould be encouraged. It is indeed mortifying to the haughty and proud Sinner, and may it give a fatal Stab to the letting out of the very Hearts-Blood of damning Pride &amp; Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s: But it's very encouraging to the awakened and deeply convinced Sinner. Such an One may think and ju&s;tly too, tho' I have been the chief of Sinners, as vile a Mi&s;creant as <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> as foul a Debauchee as <HI>Mary Magdalene,</HI> once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;even Devils, as virulent an Oppo&s;er and Per&s;ecutor of tho&s;e zealou&s;ly engaged to build up the Kingdom of Chri&s;t in it's Power and Purity as ever <HI>Saul</HI> (afterwards called <HI>Paul</HI>) was while a Phari&s;ee; and even wor&s;e than any or all the&s;e: Yet if the Grace of God to Sinners be merely &s;overeign and arbitrary, it may be I may obtain Mercy thro' Chri&s;t: <HI>For it is a faithful Say|ing and worthy of all Acceptation, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the World to &s;ave Sinners, of whom</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>I am chief.</HI> 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.15.</P>

USE IV. For In&s;truction to tho&s;e who are reflect|ing on the State of their own Souls, with a De&s;ire to know what it is.&mdash;We are all of us apace going off the Stage of this Life: It is but a little while before the Places that now know us will know us no more: And it's very probable that many of us, now in Com|pany before the Lord in his Hou&s;e, will be in Eter|nity before the Revolution of another Year. We likewi&s;e know that we all have immortal Souls capa|ble of exi&s;ting &s;eperately in a State of Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery during their Seperation from the Body; and that even our Bodies them&s;elves &s;hall be rai&s;ed at the la&s;t Day out of their Du&s;t, and be again animated with the &s;ame Souls; and that there is prepared for the everla&s;ting Entertainment of every one of us, either an Heaven of Happine&s;s, or an Hell of Mi&s;ery inex|pre&s;&s;ible, according as we are found in a State of Grace or of Sin, at the Time of our Nature's Di&s;&s;olution. I hope therefore that many of you are di&s;po&s;ed to enquire &s;eriou&s;ly into your Sate with a &s;incere De&s;ire to know what it is; that you may have the greater Comfort and Joy if it be &s;afe; or if otherwi&s;e, that you may fly for your Lives to the alone Hope and Refuge &s;et before you, whil&s;t the Golden Sceptre of Grace is extended, and the Door of Mercy &s;tands open. Now for this Purpo&s;e I &s;hall agreeable to this Subject recommend it to you, to enquire clo&s;ely and impar|tially in &s;undry Particulars, in which, I be&s;eech, be faithful to your own Souls.</P>
<P N="1">1. Enquire; Have you ever had a clear Sen&s;e of Divine Sovereignty in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of your &s;piritual and eternal Salvation? Can you with Under&s;tanding and in Sincerity &s;ub&s;cribe your A&s;&s;ent to the Truth of our Doctrine? Think clo&s;ely what An&s;wer you would return if God him&s;elf &s;hould demand of you and &s;ay; Sinner! What thinke&s;t thou? May I do what I will with mine own? Is it certain, true and ju&s;t, that I may di&s;tribute &s;pecial and &s;aving Grace
<PB N="34" REF="004699_0032_100DBB6289B0F500">and Mercy thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t to whom I will, and merely becau&s;e I will? I would with all Humility &s;ay to thee, Sinner, as God in another Ca&s;e to <HI>David,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.13. <HI>Advi&s;e now and &s;ee what An&s;wer I &s;hall return to him that &s;ent me.</HI> If thou can&s;t an&s;wer clearly and fully in the affirmative; it is well as far as it goes. But this alone will not di&s;criminate a godly Per&s;on, for many in this Point as well others, may &s;eem to have &s;ound Heads, who yet have rotten Hearts. But if thou he&s;itate&s;t on this Point, but more e&s;pecially if thou an&s;were&s;t boldly in the Negative; the Examination needs go no farther; there appears upon thee a very black Mark, &s;uch as is not the Spot of God's Children. But &s;uch an One as an&s;wers this fir&s;t Enquiry in the Affirmative, I be&s;eech farther to enquire.</P>
<P N="2">2. Have you ever been brought to a full Submi&s;&s;ion to Divine Sovereignty in the Di&s;tribution of &s;aving Mercies thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t? This is a Step far beyond the former: That hath it's Seat in the Head, this in the Heart; that in the Under&s;tanding only, this in the Will al&s;o; that may be alone without this, but this latter always pre-&s;uppo&s;eth the former. Have you, being fully convinced of the Truth of the Doc|trine, and notwith&s;tanding a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the Wrath and Indignation of an holy Sin-hating God again&s;t &s;uch a fallen guilty Creature as you are, have you humbly ca&s;t your &s;elf down at the Foot-&s;tool of the Throne of Grace, re&s;olvedly waiting there, until it &s;hall plea&s;e him to extend &s;aving Mercy to you thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with an Heart di&s;po&s;ed to ju&s;tify God, if after all he &s;hould finally reject you? If a well in|formed Con&s;cience can clearly an&s;wer this Enquiry in the Affirmative; the Ca&s;e looks very hopeful. But I fear &s;ome are dangerou&s;ly deceived in this critical Point: therefore for farther Proof, enquire in the next Place,</P>
<P N="3">3. Have you ever found any con&s;iderable Struggling and Oppo&s;ition in your Hearts again&s;t this Submi&s;&s;i|on
<PB N="35" REF="004699_0033_100DBB6445E05D30">on to Divine Sovereignty?&mdash;An&s;wer hone&s;tly. If you have had &s;uch Struggles in your Heart; it's &s;trange that you &s;hould not be &s;en&s;ible of it: And if your Heart hath never oppo&s;ed this Submi&s;&s;ion I am &s;peaking of, I am at lea&s;t very &s;u&s;picious that you are Strangers to the Thing it &s;elf. Oh! the proud and &s;tout hearted Sinner can't bear to buckle thus. What? To &s;ubmit to God's &s;overeign Di&s;po&s;al, without a previous A&s;&s;urance of a good I&s;&s;ue? No, it's more than Fle&s;h and Blood can bear. Here the Sinner &s;tarts back, this is the &s;pecial critical Point, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Pinch attending the New-Birth: Hitherto come many Sinners who never at la&s;t get through this Spot: Here is their <HI>ne plus ultra;</HI> and &s;o the poor Creatures final|ly peri&s;h after very hopeful Beginnings. And tho&s;e who have at length happily got through the&s;e Straits, have ordinarily found a great deal of Difficulty here, through the Reluctancy of their own proud Hearts, who can't ea&s;ily bear to part with their own Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, of which they mu&s;t be &s;tript &s;tark naked, or el&s;e they can never &s;hoot this Gulf. Are you &s;en&s;ible that you have met with Difficulty in this Spot, and found your Proud Hearts di&s;po&s;e to wrangle again&s;t God, thinking it hard that thou mu&s;t &s;ubmit at his Foot without A&s;&s;urance beforehand of a good I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P N="4">4. Enquire; Have you been a&s;hamed and even confounded on the Account of this your Oppo&s;ition, and found it at length effectually born down? If &s;o there is great Grounds of Hope in your Ca&s;e, that the Match betwixt Chri&s;t and your Soul will be &s;oon made up, if it be not already con&s;ummated; the main Impediment being now removed: E&s;pecially if</P>
<P N="5">5. You have hereupon found the Burden, lying on you before, in a great Mea&s;ure taken off. I believe that the Promi&s;e of Re&s;t, which Chri&s;t makes to wea|ry and heavyladen Souls coming to him, always takes Place in &s;ome &s;en&s;ible Degree, on the Soul's fir&s;t clo|&s;ing with Chri&s;t. And I believe, that if the Re&s;t, that
<PB N="36" REF="004699_0034_100DBB67999B38B8">a Soul finds, be con&s;equential to the Submi&s;&s;ion be|fore &s;poken of, it is an hopeful Symptom of it's Uni|on with Chri&s;t. But if pre&s;ent Quietne&s;s in a Soul lately di&s;tre&s;t be not introduced by this Submi&s;&s;ion it is a cur&s;ed Peace ari&s;ing either from the Returns of former Stupidity, or rather the governing Prevalence of a &s;elf-righteous Spirit. But enquire further,</P>
<P N="6">6. Hath the Ea&s;e and Comfort you find in the hopeful Method afore&s;aid been attended with a deep Sen&s;e of your own Vilene&s;s on the one Hand, and of the a&s;toni&s;hing Riches of divine Grace through Je&s;us Chri&s;t on the other? If not, your Peace is not ge|nuine but &s;purious and wor&s;e than Nothing. But if you now think more meanly of your&s;elves, and more highly and adoringly of the infinite Riches of Divine Grace in and through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to &s;uch vile, con|temptible, ill-de&s;erving Creatures as you are; there is Ground to hope, your Peace is &s;uch as Chri&s;t has gi|ven; and that your State is &s;afe. E&s;pecially,</P>
<P N="7">7. If you find hereupon evidently a new Turn of Soul, in all the Powers thereof. That will doubtle&s;s always hold thus which the Apo&s;tle tells us, 2 Cor. 5.17. <HI>If any Man be in Chri&s;t, he is a new Creature, old Things are pa&s;t away, behold all Things are become new.</HI> How is it with you? Do you find this? The Soul of Man is capable of reflex Acts upon it &s;elf. Look within and &s;ee, if there be any evident Turn there, in your Under&s;tanding, Will and Affections. Have you <HI>put off the old Man with his Deeds, and put on the new Man which is renewed in Knowledge, after the Image of him who has created you anew, Col.</HI> 3. 9, 10. He that pa&s;&s;eth out of a State of Nature into that of Grace, is withal tran&s;lated out of Darkne&s;s into marvellous Light; <HI>for God, who commanded the Light to &s;hine out of Darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined in our Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.6. Every true Convert is in the be&s;t Sen&s;e a new light Man: He &s;ees now as he
<PB N="37" REF="004699_0035_100DBB69C6B83318">never &s;aw before: He is quite a new Scene opening before him. Again, there is a notable Change now in the Will: The Objects of it's Choice on the one Hand, and of it's Rejection on the other, are now the Rever&s;e of what they were before. Tho&s;e who &s;incerely <HI>take hold on the Covenant, chu&s;e the Things that plea&s;e God, I&s;a.</HI> 56.4. They now with <HI>Mo&s;es, chu&s;e rather to &s;uffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the Plea&s;ures of Sin for a Sea&s;on, e&s;teem|ing the Reproach of Chri&s;t greater Riches, than the Trea&s;ures in Egypt,</HI> Heb. 11.25, 26. Once more the Affections now run in new Channels, both the clo&s;ing Affections, as, De&s;ire, Hope, Love, Joy <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the &s;eperating Affections, as, Contempt, Fear, Hatred, Grief <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e Affections are indeed phy|&s;ically con&s;idered, the &s;ame as they were; but they are objectively va&s;tly differing, yea and contrary. Now &s;piritual and heavenly Things are the Objects of the Souls principal De&s;ire, Hope, Love and Joy; in&s;tead of &s;inful, or at be&s;t merely carnal Enjoyments. Now the Believer treads the Moon under his Feet, looks with Contempt on all the &s;ublunary World, with its Plea&s;ures, Profits and Honours, that before appeared gay and charming. Now <HI>he fears not them which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul; but he fears him who is able to de&s;troy both Soul and Body in Hell;</HI> not with a &s;lavi&s;h, but a filial Fear. Now he is no more as formerly a Hater of God and Holine&s;s, but of Sin; this is the Object of his implacable Dete&s;ta|tion. Now he grieves bitterly not for the Di&s;appoin|ment of his worldly Schemes and Hopes as before, but for his Sins that have &s;eperated betwixt God and him, and occa&s;ioned the hiding of God's Face from his Soul, and whereby he hath rendred him&s;elf guilty of the greate&s;t Folly and ba&s;e&s;t Ingratitude; and he can never enjoy an Hour's Comfort more in any Thing until he can again &s;en&s;ibly find Chri&s;t, <HI>whom his Soul loves,</HI> and after whom his Soul <HI>panteth, as the Hart
<PB N="38" REF="004699_0036_100DBB6B9877C370">panteth after the Water-Brooks.</HI> Moreover this Change of the Soul it's &s;everal Powers will always influence the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Conver&s;ation unto Holine&s;s, <HI>without which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> Now <HI>Sin will not reign in the mortal Body of a Believer, that he &s;hould obey it in the Lu&s;ts thereof, neither will he yield his Members as In&s;truments of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s unto Sin; but yield him&s;elf unto God, as one that is alive from the Dead, and his Members as In&s;truments of Righteou&s;ne&s;s unto God.</HI></P>
<P>But its more then Time, I had concluded. Dearly beloved Friends! who are now reflecting on your State for the Dis&s;covery of it, be per&s;waded hone&s;tly, clo&s;ely and prayerfully to improve the Rules of Trial, which I have laid before you with as much Plainne&s;s as I can; together with what other Helps for this Purpo&s;e you have had and may yet farther have; and this with a &s;incere De&s;ire to know the Truth. Hereupon it is highly probable, &s;ome of you may find Rea&s;on to conclude, that you are yet in a State of Nature, adn perhaps others, that you are hopefully in a State of Grace.&mdash; To tho&s;e of the former Sort,</P>
<P>I have not Time to offer any Thing farther in parti|cular, and mu&s;t therefore only refer you to, and earne&s;tly be&s;eech, yea and &s;olemnly charge you in the Contempt at your utmo&s;t Peril another Day; that you heedfully ob&s;erve the Caution given in U&s;e &s;econd, and the encouraging In&s;truction in U&s;e third, both de&s;ignedly calculated for your Benefit: The Lord of his Infinite Mercy add his Ble&s;&s;ing thereunto.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e of the latter Sort I &s;hall offer a few Words of Advice.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be humble and thankful. Entertain the meane&s;t Thoughts of your &s;elves, and mo&s;t thankful and adoring Thoughts of the Infinite Riches of Divine Grace in Chri&s;t towards you. Don't <HI>&s;acrifice to your own Net, nor burn Incen&s;e to your own Drag.</HI> Say
<PB N="39" REF="004699_0037_100DBB6D67781870">feelingly, <HI>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy Name, O Lord, be all the Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Be exemplary in Holine&s;s, that the good Ways of the Lord may be well and not ill &s;poken of on your Account. <HI>Let your Lights &s;o &s;hine before others, that they &s;eeing your good Works may glori&s;y your Fa|ther which is in Heaven.</HI> Remember, <HI>that unto whom|&s;oever much is given, of him &s;hall be much required.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Boa&s;t not your &s;elves over others. Learn <HI>that no one of you be puffed up again&s;t another: For who maketh thee to differ from another, and what ha&s;t thou, that thou did&s;t not receive, why do&s;t thou glory as if thou had&s;t not received it?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Be encouraged to tru&s;t and hope in God thro' Chri&s;t for all pre&s;ent and future needed Supplies of Grace from Time to Time. If God of his mere Sovereignty hath brought you into a State of Grace, out of a State of Nature, when you could lay no Claim to any Promi&s;e of it; how much more may you now, for all needed Supplies tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, to whom you are united, <HI>in whom the Promi&s;es are yea, and in him Amen, unto the Glory of God by us?</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Be not diffident concerning others, your Rela|tions and Friends at pre&s;ent in a Gracele&s;s and Chri&s;t|le&s;s State. But take Pains with them, as far as there appears any the lea&s;t Probability of it's being &s;ervi|ceable to them: And be&s;ure bear them much on your Hearts in Prayer before God, <HI>who can do all Things, and from whom no Thought can be with-holden.</HI> Don't let your Hearts &s;ink down under the la&s;t Di&s;|couragements in the Ca&s;e of any of them. Remem|ber here two Things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Sovereignty of Divine Grace. If the Mercy of God takes it's Ri&s;e merely from his own &s;overeign good Plea&s;ure, and not from any Thing fir&s;t found in the Creature, as you experimentally know in your own Ca&s;e; you have no Rea&s;on to de&s;pair of One, who &s;eems at the greate&s;t Remove from any Thing that is Good.</ITEM>

2. Altho' the poor Chri&s;tle&s;s Sinner hath no Claim to the Promi&s;es, yet you (being in Chri&s;t Je&s;us) have a Claim, and may humbly and believingly plead the Promi&s;es on behalf of &s;uch an One. If what we find in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.25. &amp;c. where God &s;peaks of re|generating as well as ju&s;tifying Grace, be lookt upon, not only as a prophetical Declaration of what a gra|cious God would in his own Time and Way do, as I have herein before con&s;idered it, but al&s;o as properly a Promi&s;e for any to lay hold upon &amp; believingly plead the Accompli&s;hment of; I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that the few truly Godly found among this People, were they to whom this Promi&s;e was fir&s;tly made, and by whom it was accordingly pleadable, tho' on the Behalf of their gracele&s;s Relatives and Friends. And <HI>we know, that no Prophecy of the Scripture is of any private Interpre|tation,</HI> 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.20. And that the Things formerly written by Divine In&s;piration, <HI>are written for our Admonition, on whom the Ends of the World are come,</HI> 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.11. On the whole, I think, dearly, be|loved in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that you have &s;uffici|ent Warrant and Encouragement mini&s;tred to you, to be painful with and prayerful for your Gracele&s;s, Chri&s;tle&s;s Relatives, e&s;pecially in &s;uch a Day as this, wherein, notwith&s;tanding a vigorous Oppo&s;ition, Sin|ners are daily in Companies flocking to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t as Doves to their Windows. The good Lord of his Infinite Mercy grant Succe&s;s to the faith|ful Endeavours and fervent Prayers of you and all others, the Children of God, on Behalf of tho&s;e poor Creatures among us, who are yet <HI>without Chri&s;t, Aliens from the Commonwealth of I&s;rael, Strangers from the Covenants of Promi&s;e, having no well ground|ed Hope, and without God in the World;</HI> that they who are yet <HI>afar off may be made nigh by the Blood of Chri&s;t;</HI> to whom be Glory for ever and ever Amen.</ITEM>
