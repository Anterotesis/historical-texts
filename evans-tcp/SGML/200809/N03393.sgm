<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearly Beloved,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was a &s;incere and high Re&s;pect for the Memory of my Reverend <HI>Father,</HI> your late excellent <HI>Pa&s;tor,</HI> to|gether with a View to your Edification, which indu|ced me to entertain you, in my publick Di&s;cour&s;e on the Sabbath after his Funeral, with &s;ome Meditations &s;uit|ed to the mournful Occa&s;ion of his Death: and I doubt not, the &s;ame Principles had their Influence in putting You upon &s;o unanimous a <HI>Vote,</HI> to a&s;k a Copy for the Pre&s;s.</P>
<P>I need not ob&s;erve to You, with what Di&s;advantages a Performance of this Nature from me (under my pre&s;ent In|di&s;po&s;itions) mu&s;t appear; while the nece&s;&s;ary Care of my broken Health forbids that Application of Thought and Care of Exactne&s;s, proper in preparing and publi&s;hing a Sermon on &s;uch a Subject and Occa&s;ion: which would have &s;uffici|ently pleaded in my Excu&s;e, if I had declin'd the Pre&s;s. However, in Deference to your Judgment and Reque&s;t, I have &s;acrific'd my own Inclinations; and venture into the publick Light, hoping for the &s;ame Candour to an imperfect Di&s;cour&s;e from others in the reading, as it met with from You in the hearing. It mu&s;t be allow'd, that an affected Nicene&s;s of Method and Ornaments of Language make but an odd Figure in a melancholy Funeral Sermon: and therefore I give you mine very much in its original inaccu|rate Dre&s;s; tho' with &s;ome few Additions, which the &s;cant Limits of a &s;ingle Hour obliged me to omit in the Pulpit.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="004140_0004_1003DAEC670CB828">As to the <HI>Character</HI> of the Decea&s;ed, &s;o far as I went into it, 'tis a Satisfaction to me, that I have your Concur|rence: for the World mu&s;t think your printing the Sermon a loud Atte&s;tation to the Ju&s;tice of my Ob&s;ervations on that head. I &s;pake indeed with the greater Freedom, becau&s;e in <HI>your</HI> hearing, who could witne&s;s I &s;poke <HI>in the Words of Truth and Soberne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>It was the known Principle and Practice of the decea&s;ed Servant of God to u&s;e a remarkable Caution and Mode&s;ty of Speech an &s;uch Occa&s;ions; nor could he reli&s;h the flow'ry Pomp of <HI>Funeral Oratory,</HI> &s;o common, and &s;o often abus'd, in prai&s;ing the Dead, to flatter the Living: Yet where any appear'd to him Per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;h'd Merits, and &s;uch as by general Suffrage wou'd be allow'd to have &s;omething due to their Memory, he wou'd &s;et an A&s;teri&s;m on their honourable Names, recommend their bright Example to Imitation, and &s;peak of their excellent Gifts, Graces, and Services, to the Honour of that God, who ble&s;s'd them, and made them Ble&s;&s;ings to their Generation. Witne&s;s in par|ticular his Funeral Sermon for the late Rev. Mr. <HI>Thomas Bridge,</HI> his worthy Colleague in the Pa&s;toral Relation, and my immediate Predece&s;&s;or: The <HI>Text</HI> and the <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> mo&s;t &s;itly applicable for the <HI>Author</HI>'s own Funeral Sermon. And accordingly I recommend it to your &s;erious Review on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I take Leave now to remind You, with what a nume|rous Succe&s;&s;ion of eminent Lights this golden Candle&s;tick has been di&s;tingui&s;h'd. You have had your <HI>Wil&s;on, Cotton, Norton, Davenport, Oxenbridge, Allen, Bridge,</HI> and <HI>Wad&s;worth;</HI> precious Gifts to you from our a&s;cended Sa|viour, Pa&s;tors and Teachers, who have fed You with Knowledge and Under&s;tanding: Be&s;ides whom, You have enjoy'd the occa&s;ional Labours of &s;everal worthy A&s;&s;i&s;tants (<HI>Moodey</HI> and <HI>Bailey</HI> in particular) for many Months, or Years together. Your evangelical Advantages &s;urely have
<PB N="iii" REF="004140_0005_1003DAF197125F40">
been great: and if your &s;piritual Improvements be not in &s;ome Proportion, your Account will be awful. And for my own part, <HI>when I con&s;ider, I am afraid.</HI> It hath often been a &s;olemn Thought with me, <HI>In who&s;e Room</HI> I &s;tood up; what aged, learned, laborious, wi&s;e, and venerable <HI>Men of God</HI> have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively gone before me in this holy Mini&s;try: and the Reflection has been very humbling to me, by a Sen&s;e of my own comparative In&s;ufficiency, Inex|perience, Unworthine&s;s, Nothingne&s;s. Sure I am, I've the greate&s;t Rea&s;on to &s;tand a&s;toni&s;h'd at the <HI>Divine Pati|ence</HI> towards me: and to admire <HI>your Candour</HI> to me, your <HI>kind Acceptance</HI> of my Labours, and the <HI>generous Tokens</HI> of your Love in Reward of them, while I have been with many Imperfections mini&s;tring among You, now full <HI>20</HI> Years. And tho' according to the general Run of human Life, I may have &s;till many Days to &s;erve You; yet the &s;urprizing Blow of God's cha&s;tning Hand upon me, not many Months &s;ince (when all about my Bed conclu|ded me under a Sentence of Death) and my habitual In|firmities in Con&s;equence thereof, did awfully warn me, and do daily admoni&s;h me, not to expect a long Continuance in this pre&s;ent evil World. O join your Prayers with mine, that a Life &s;o wonderfully reprieved from De&s;truction, may be employed more than ever for the Glory of God and the Service of your Souls, to which I hope it is &s;incerely de|voted; and that when called from You (God only knows how &s;oon or &s;uddenly) I may be found with my Work done, and my Accounts ready, and may fini&s;h my Cour&s;e with Joy. I wi&s;h you a <HI>durable,</HI> as well as great Ble&s;&s;ing, in my dear <HI>Colleague,</HI> your other Pa&s;tor! And this I pray, that your Love may abound yet more and more in Know|ledge and in all Judgment; that ye may approve Things that are excellent, and continue in the things which ye have learned, and be watchful to &s;trengthen the Things which remain that are ready to die.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="004140_0006_1003DAF4136DC140">Let us all concur in heartily lamenting the great and growing <HI>Degeneracies</HI> of the pre&s;ent Day: and let us unite our fervent Prayers, our &s;olicitous Cares, and &s;trenuous Endeavours for the happy Re&s;urrection and Flou|ri&s;hing of Religion and Virtue among us, which is our Life, our true&s;t pro&s;perity, and brighte&s;t Crown.

<P>And have we not Rea&s;on to lay to Heart the many &s;or|rowful In&s;tances of <HI>Mortality,</HI> we've &s;een in the Cour&s;e of a very few Years, among our Pious and U&s;eful, and our Aged and Honorable? <HI>For behold, the Lord, the Lord of Ho&s;ts, doth take away from</HI> us <HI>the Stay and the Staff, the Judge, and the Prophet, and the Prudent, and the Ancient, the honourable Man, and the Coun&s;ellor, the cunning Artificer, and the eloquent Orator.</HI> Verily by repeated Lo&s;&s;es of Men of Note in the Congregation, a holy &s;overeign God has been not only le&s;&s;ening our Number, but thinning our Glory, impoveri&s;hing our Trea&s;ury, and weakning our Strength. Their hoary Heads were a vi&s;i|ble Ornament in our A&s;&s;embly; their &s;hining Characters reflected a &s;uperior Lu&s;tre upon it; and their &s;everal In|tere&s;ts, Powers, and active Virtues abundantly &s;trengthen'd our Hands, and encourag'd our Hearts. But now a me|lancholy Emptine&s;s is &s;een, where they us'd to appear and act. Alas, how &s;adly do we mi&s;s them!

worthy and faithful Deacons, the late Mr. <HI>Jonathan Williams;</HI> over who&s;e Grave I cannot refrain dropping a Tear of Condolence with You, and paying a &s;mall Tribute to his Memory. May the God of all Grace &s;anctify the Death of his Servant to the bereaved Children and Rela|tives, to his mournful Brethren in Office, and to us all! We have lo&s;t in him the amiable Example of a devout, ju&s;t, peaceable, charitable, and humble Chri&s;tian, and the valu|able Help of a very active, prudent, and u&s;eful Servant of the Church. The main Qualifications of a <HI>Deacon,</HI> as they are laid down by the in&s;pir'd Apo&s;tle in his Epi&s;tle to <HI>Timothy,</HI> were vi&s;ible in this our Brother; <HI>Gravity, In|tegrity, Temperance, Genero&s;ity, &s;ound Faith, and a pure Con&s;cience.</HI> We mu&s;t bear him this Te&s;timony, that he hath <HI>u&s;ed his Office well;</HI> and having &s;erved his Ge|neration according to the Will of God, he is <HI>(with</HI> Stephen) fallen a&s;leep. But <HI>if we believe that Je&s;us died, and ro&s;e again, even &s;o them al&s;o which &s;leep in Je&s;us, will God bring with him:</HI> and for our further Con&s;olation, in the mean time, <HI>we &s;ee Je&s;us who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the &s;uffering of Death, crown'd with Glory and Honour; Head over all things to his Church, and the Saviour of the Body.</HI> Having a&s;cended up on high, he has received Gifts for Men: and of his Fulne&s;s may we &s;till look to receive, even Grace for Grace, Ble&s;&s;ing upon Ble&s;&s;ing.

Let it be your Prayer day and night, that a gracious God wou'd pardon our Sins, and heal our Back|&s;lidings, whereby we have expo&s;'d our &s;elves to his fear|ful Judgments; That he wou'd return and vi&s;it his Peo|ple, made weak by the Fall of &s;o many of his righteous Ones; and that He wou'd clo&s;e the Breaches in our Walls,

by rai&s;ing up a Succe&s;&s;ion of Per&s;ons of a like excellent Spirit and exemplary u&s;eful Life, as tho&s;e that have left us, and who may be like Ble&s;&s;ings to us, bright Pledges of his &s;piritual Pre&s;ence in the mid&s;t of us.

<P>AS there's no Hi&s;tory in the World of like An|tiquity with the <HI>Bible,</HI> &s;o none of &s;uch exten&s;ive and happy Influence; none of equal U&s;e and Service to Mankind. For in the &s;acred Story we have &s;uch Accounts of the <HI>Works of God,</HI> Creation, Providence, and Redemption, as pre&s;ent his amiable (but &s;till tremendous) Perfections to our View in the be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Light, far tran&s;cending the highe&s;t Di&s;coveries of mere natural Rea&s;on; and con&s;equently have a powerful Tendency both to awaken in every con&s;idering Soul very awful Apprehen&s;ions of his Ma|je&s;ty and Greatne&s;s, and to encourage our Hope and Confidence in his Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s, and Truth: And here too we have &s;uch Narratives of innumerable <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Servants of God</HI> in former Ages of the World, their Character and Conduct, Experiences and Ob&s;er|vations, Lives and Deaths, as are eminently u&s;eful for the Direction of our Faith and Practice, afford very convincing Arguments for the Reality, Excellency and

Advantage of Divine Revelation, and tend to acquaint us more fully with the glorious Principles of our holy Religion, to e&s;tabli&s;h our Belief of its important Doc|trines, and engage our Attention and Obedience to its incomparably wi&s;e and righteous Precepts. As an ad|mirable Harmony runs thro' all the Revelations of God to the Sons of Men, &s;o a beautiful Congruity every where appears in the Faith, Wor&s;hip, and Morals of all Saints (tho' variou&s;ly excelling in Proportion to the Divine Light and Grace di&s;pens'd to them) thro' all &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Ages of the World. The in&s;pired Records of the <HI>Apo&s;tolick</HI> Age may have furni&s;h'd us with the plaine&s;t and faire&s;t, the mo&s;t familiar and mo&s;t inde|fective Copies for our Imitation: Yet <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>the Prophets</HI> are not to be thrown by as u&s;ele&s;s, nor the Examples of <HI>Old Te&s;tament-Saints</HI> to be neglected, as of no Importance to us under the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation; but even the&s;e are applicable for the Regulation of our Belief, our Temper and Deportment, in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial In&s;tances, with relation to the Things of God and Eternity, and for our Encouragement and A&s;&s;i&s;tance upon many Occa&s;ions in the Cour&s;e of the Chri&s;tian Life.</P>
<P>On the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, when we are call'd to mourn the Death of an eminently pious and u&s;eful Ser|vant of God, I have &s;ingled out the Example of re|nowned <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> (who had <HI>his Ma&s;ter taken from his head</HI>) to teach us the mo&s;t proper Conduct under &s;uch a Di&s;|pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>My Text &s;tands in Connection with the remarkable Story of <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Tran&s;lation to the Church triumphant above, and <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;ion into his Place in the Church militant below. We hear <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> pathetically mourning the Departure of the old illu&s;trious Prophet: As he &s;aw him a&s;cend in a Chariot of Fire, carry'd up by a Whirlwind into Heaven, he rent his Clothes, and with the Pa&s;&s;ion of a bereaved Son cried after him, <HI>My
<PB N="3" REF="004140_0011_1003DB06532D4D40">
Father, my Father, the Chariot of I&s;rael and the Hor&s;e|men thereof!</HI> &mdash; However, he did not long &s;tand gazing up into Heaven: but pre&s;ently taking up the Mantle of <HI>Elijah,</HI> that had fallen from him at his &s;udden Rap|ture, and welcoming this de&s;irable Memorial of his en|deared Father, the vi&s;ible Badge of his Office, and a happy Pledge of his inheriting the Ble&s;&s;ing that had been promis'd him, he goes forth in the Spirit of <HI>Elias</HI> to enter into his Labours, and goes on his way crying after the GOD of his Ma&s;ter, and walking in the Steps of his Faith. That is now his &s;olicitous Inquiry, <HI>Where is the Lord God of</HI> Elijah? Not &s;atisfied with having <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Mantle, he mu&s;t have <HI>Elijah</HI>'s GOD too, in the &s;en&s;ible Effects of his powerful and gracious <HI>Pre&s;ence</HI> with him (the &s;ame as had been with his holy Predece&s;&s;or) which wou'd abundantly make Amends for the Lo&s;s he was mourning under, be the mo&s;t effec|tual Relief to his &s;orrowful Heart, the be&s;t Help to him in the important Work now devolv'd upon him, and an encouraging Pre&s;age of his future U&s;efulne&s;s.&mdash; He do's not employ him&s;elf in a fruitle&s;s Search for <HI>Elijah</HI>; like the Sons of the Prophets, who cou'd not believe his bodily Tran&s;lation to Heaven, but ima|gining that his <HI>dead</HI> Corp&s;e might be dropt upon &s;ome remote Mountain, or rather perhaps that he was tran|&s;ported <HI>alive</HI> to &s;ome di&s;tant ob&s;cure Place, and (if &s;o) ought &s;till to retain his Dignity and Station, as Head of the Prophets, would not be re&s;trained from going in Que&s;t after him. Nor do's he lay out any Thought or Pains in curious Speculations upon the invi&s;ible World and hidden Life, the Prophet was exalted to: nor in pa&s;&s;ionate Aggravations of his own and the pub|lick Lo&s;s, by the Departure of &s;o eminent a Man of God. Neither do we hear any ra&s;h Wi&s;hes for his Return; much le&s;s any idolatrous Application to him for his Favour and Help: No, tho' <HI>Elijah</HI> be in a State of Exaltation, a glorious and happy Saint, made like
<PB N="4" REF="004140_0012_1003DB0958E02230">
unto the Angels, yet <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> knows better than to pay him Divine Honours, or place him in God's &s;tead. But well aware that his Help is in the Name of the Lord, and hoping to find him a very pre&s;ent Help, he looks off from the Creature, unto the Creator, who is ble&s;&s;ed for ever, and who will cau&s;e the Ble&s;&s;ing to re&s;t upon them, that wait for him. He a&s;ks not for <HI>Elijah,</HI> but inquires after his GOD. <HI>Where is the LORD God of</HI> Elijah? Or, as it may be read, <HI>Where is Jehovah, the God of</HI> Elijah, <HI>even He</HI>! The Hebrew Words (APH HU) which our Ver&s;ion joyns to the follow|ing Clau&s;e, as &s;poken of <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> &s;tand in the Original connected with the Words foregoing, and are under|&s;tood by learned Criticks as adding an Empha&s;is to <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI>'s Que&s;tion, <HI>Where is the LORD, the God of</HI> Elijah, <HI>even He, Him&s;elf?</HI> 'Tis not the Language of Infidelity or Diffidence, the Expo&s;tulation of an unbe|lieving or doubting Soul, that que&s;tion'd the Being of <HI>Elijah</HI>'s God, di&s;puted his Omnipre&s;ence, or &s;u&s;pected his Power or Faithfulne&s;s to accompli&s;h the great and precious Promi&s;e <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> had lately received: But rather 'tis the humble and earne&s;t Expectation and Prayer of Faith, That <HI>Elijah</HI>'s God would be with his &s;urviv|ing Son and Succe&s;&s;or, and now give an early Proof of <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Spirit being come upon him (according to his own former Wi&s;h, and the departed Prophet's Farewel-Benediction) in a double Portion of Gifts, Graces, and Ble&s;&s;ings.</P>

So <HI>Gideon,</HI> when the Angel of the Lord appeared to him, &s;aying, <HI>The LORD is with thee, thou mighty Man of Valour</HI>; made that Reply, <HI>Oh my Lord,</HI> if the <HI>LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and WHERE be all his Miracles, which our Fathers told us of?</HI> (Judg. 6.13.)

Evident it is, tint the <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Human</HI> NATURES are here put in Contradi&s;tinction, one to the other: and while the words [<HI>Man</HI> and <HI>Son of Man</HI>] &s;ignify a Being created, a Nature frail, imper|fect, and very mutable, the other and oppo&s;ite word [<HI>God</HI>] is u&s;ed to denote a Being uncau&s;ed and eternal, a Nature ab&s;olutely and immutably perfect, infinitely good and glorious and ble&s;&s;ed in it &s;elf, and for ever independent; which, upon a little Reflection, will be found Ideas e&s;&s;entially connected with, and in&s;eparable from the Character of <HI>Almighty.</HI> ELOHIM then, in the true, original, and complex Notion of the Word, is

Natural Rea|&s;on is capable of &s;trongly arguing the UNITY of the Godhead: but &s;upernatural Revelation makes the fur|ther Di&s;covery of a TRINITY <HI>in Unity.</HI> The holy Scripture makes tho&s;e <HI>Per&s;onal</HI> Attributions to the &s;acred THREE, which manife&s;tly infer their different Modes of Sub&s;i&s;tence: and yet it a&s;cribes all Divine Perfections and Honours equally to them all, which as manife&s;tly infers their being <HI>One</HI> in E&s;&s;ence.

But &s;till the primary Signification is retain'd, and is well con&s;i&s;tent with this U&s;e of the Words.

We &s;hould examine what Evidences we have of a Covenant-Intere&s;t in GOD, and vital Relation to Him as <HI>our</HI> GOD in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> O let us all look to it, that we do not <HI>fail of the Grace of GOD</HI>; that we do not fail of &s;ecuring this great and mo&s;t momentous Concern: for if the LORD be not <HI>our</HI> GOD, in the Sen&s;e of the Go&s;pel-Covenant, He will be a <HI>Con&s;uming Fire</HI> to us.

<P><HI>Finally,</HI> in a Word, let &s;uch as have &s;incerely avouch|ed the LORD for their GOD, &s;ee to it, that they <HI>walk worthy of the LORD unto all Plea&s;ing,</HI> that they adorn their high Profe&s;&s;ion by a <HI>good Conver&s;ation in Chri&s;t,</HI> and continually be in Care to live and act up to their &s;piritual Dignity, Privileges and Hopes; making it appear to the World, that the LORD is indeed <HI>their GOD,</HI> by exhibiting the Image of GOD upon them, a vi&s;ible Re&s;emblance of his moral Perfections. Let your Light &s;o &s;hine before Men, that they &s;eeing your good Works, may glorify GOD in You: and thus &s;hall Chri&s;t be magnify'd in your Body, whether it be by Life or Death, and in nothing &s;hall you be a&s;hamed, but you &s;hall have Hope in Death, and Bold|ne&s;s in the Day of Judgment, that great Day of our GOD, when He &s;hall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.</P>

<P N="3">[3.] Con&s;ider <HI>Elijah</HI> as a faithful <HI>Prophet</HI> and emi|nent Mini&s;ter of Religion, &s;o the LORD was <HI>his GOD</HI> in a &s;till more emphatic Sen&s;e. Being brought very nigh to GOD, &s;eparated to &s;pecial Service in the King|dom of GOD by a peculiar Covenant (like that we read of, <HI>Mal.</HI> 2.8. <HI>the Covenant of</HI> Levi) being en|dowed with Mini&s;terial Gifts and Graces in a remarka|ble Eminency, as al&s;o admitted to a di&s;tingui&s;hing Intimacy of Friend&s;hip and Communion with the GOD of Heaven, and at the &s;ame time there being &s;o <HI>few other</HI> faithful Prophets in the Land, that <HI>Elijah,</HI> even he <HI>only</HI> had &s;eem'd to <HI>remain a Prophet of the Lord,</HI>

at lea&s;t in Compare with <HI>Baal</HI>'s Prophets, which ap|pear'd in mighty Crowds at the famous Conte&s;t he had with them before <HI>Ahab</HI> and all the People) upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations <HI>Elijah</HI> might well have this &s;ingular Honour put upon him, to have the LORD called <HI>his GOD,</HI> the Lord God of <HI>Elijah.</HI></P>
<P>However, the Scriptures put the &s;ame Di&s;tinction on many others. Thus we hear Him call'd the Lord God of <HI>Shem,</HI> the God of <HI>Aaron,</HI> the God of <HI>Daniel,</HI> and other Prophets. And this Honour is extended to the faithful Prophets in general, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.6. <HI>The LORD GOD of the holy Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>Now this, I think, is &s;afely applicable (tho' in lower Re&s;pects) concerning <HI>ordinary,</HI> as well as extraordinary Prophets. The faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t (tho' not furni&s;h'd with miraculous Gifts and Powers) may be call'd <HI>holy Prophets:</HI> and it's no Pre&s;umption to claim <HI>Elijah</HI>'s GOD for <HI>the LORD their GOD.</HI> It is ob&s;erva|ble, <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> tho' he did not the Miracles which <HI>Elijah</HI> is famous for, yet Chri&s;t pronounces him <HI>more than a Prophet,</HI> greater even than <HI>Elias,</HI> who was but a Type &amp; Figure of <HI>John:</HI> yet at the &s;ame time he adds, <HI>Notwith&s;tanding, he that is lea&s;t in the Kingdom of Heaven, is greater than he</HI>; which Pa&s;&s;age (tho' judiciou&s;ly thought by &s;ome to have a confin'd Re&s;pect, as &s;poken by Chri&s;t of <HI>him&s;elf</HI>) is apply'd by many Expo&s;itors as &s;poken of the lea&s;t Saint or the lea&s;t Mini&s;ter under the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation; and &s;o apply'd, it is true, of the <HI>faithful Mini&s;ter</HI> e&s;pecially, in &s;ome Regards. However, Go&s;|pel-Mini&s;ters in common being Divinely intitled <HI>Pro|phets,</HI> we need make no Scruple of applying to the Ca&s;e of faithful Pa&s;tors and Teachers, that remarkable Scripture, <HI>The Lord God of the holy Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>Here I may &s;ay di&s;tinctly, tho' very briefly,</P>
<P N="1">1. The LORD may be call'd the GOD of Mini&s;ters in general, as they are by their &s;pecial Character and Calling <HI>Men of God</HI>; in an eminent Manner &s;eparated

from the World, and placed as Pillars in the Hou&s;e of the living GOD; dedicated to a peculiar Mini&s;try for the Intere&s;t and Honour of GOD in his Church; commi&s;&s;ioned in the Word of GOD, and call'd in the Providence of GOD, and by the Spirit of GOD fur|ni&s;h'd and &s;pirited to their &s;acred Employment; which is to manage (in GOD's Name) a Treaty of Peace with Rebel-Mankind, &s;hewing Sinners the Way of Salvation, and praying them in CHRIST's Stead (as tho' GOD did be&s;eech 'em by us) that they would be reconcil'd to GOD; to in&s;truct in the Truths of GOD, and inculcate the Precepts of GOD; to warn, reprove, exhort, and comfort the People of GOD, according to their re&s;pective Ca&s;es, and according to the Tenour of the Go&s;pel of GOD; to admini&s;ter the holy Seals of GOD's Covenant; to lead in the publick Devotions to GOD; to go before his People in an Example of all holy Conver&s;ation, and a lively Walk with GOD. And thus being by their <HI>Character</HI> and <HI>Office,</HI> eminent Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Religion, and peculiarly the Servants of GOD, He may very properly be call'd the LORD GOD of Evangelical Mini&s;ters in general now, in &s;ome &s;ort as He was of <HI>Elijah</HI> and the ancient Prophets. Indeed worldly and carnally-minded vicious Mini&s;ters, it's confe&s;s'd, are &s;ome of the wor&s;t of Mortals; and as having corrupted the Covenant of <HI>Levi,</HI> de&s;erve to be abandon'd of GOD and Man: Yet while Mini&s;ters are in Behaviour as becometh Godline&s;s, however their Hearts mayn't be right with God, they are &s;till to be held in Reputation by us as being by their Station and Character <HI>Men of God,</HI> and vi&s;ibly related to GOD as in a high Sen&s;e <HI>their GOD.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He is the LORD GOD of his <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>faithful</HI> Mini&s;ters in a particular Manner and in a very &s;upe|rior Sen&s;e.</P>

He ap|pear'd the LORD GOD of <HI>Elijah</HI> and the in&s;pir'd Pro|phets by In&s;tances of Favour and Honour done them, which were as extraordinary as their Commi&s;&s;ion and

their Gifts: But &s;till his ordinary faithful Prophets are own'd and ble&s;s'd of GOD in Ways more common, yet u&s;ually remarkable, and &s;ometimes very Singular. They have the Special Pre&s;ence of GOD with them, in their &s;everal Mea&s;ures. They are the &s;pecial Care of his Fatherly Providence, and have holy Angels invi&s;ibly mini&s;tring to them.

How have they at &s;ome Sea&s;ons experienc'd very ap|parently the Communion of the Holy Gho&s;t, in a high Degree! How has the Spirit of Supplication been pour'd out upon 'em, that (like <HI>Elias</HI>) they have pray'd earne&s;tly! And how has GOD honour'd them by &s;ignal An&s;wers of Prayer! And in pleading his Cau&s;e, how has He &s;ometimes given them a Mouth and Wi&s;dom, a Courage and Zeal, that the Adver&s;ary cou'd not re|&s;i&s;t! How have their Hearts flamed out in fervent Love to Chri&s;t, their whole Souls been fir'd with a holy Indignation again&s;t Error and Wickedne&s;s, and their melted Bowels gu&s;h'd out in the tendered Com|pa&s;&s;ions to poor peri&s;hing Sinners! They have &s;ome|times appear'd full of GOD, in their Divine Temper and Conduct: and have had GOD manife&s;tly <HI>with</HI> them in their Work, &s;tanding by 'em in their &s;piritual En|counters, &s;trengthning them to fulfil their &s;acred Mi|ni&s;try, and di&s;tingui&s;hing them by making 'em the joyful In&s;truments of &s;upporting and promoting the Profe&s;&s;ion, Love, and Practice of Religion, and thereby the Intere&s;t and Honour of GOD in the World!

have the Scenes of a holy and u&s;eful Life &s;hut up in a &s;erene and peaceful, if not joyful and triumphant Death!&mdash; Shall we not own now, that JEHOVAH is <HI>the LORD GOD of the holy Prophets,</HI> in a ble&s;&s;ed tran&s;cendent Sen&s;e, very vi&s;ibly in the pre&s;ent World?</P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t be remember'd, even all this do's not take in the complete Scope and Intention of tho&s;e com|prehen&s;ive Words, <HI>The LORD GOD of</HI> Elijah: But the Expre&s;&s;ion has a further View, and reaches to <HI>ano|ther</HI> and <HI>better</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> World. <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> (in our Text) looks beyond the pre&s;ent Life, and even after the Pro|phet's <HI>Departure</HI> out of this temporal State adores God as &s;till the LORD GOD of <HI>Elijah.</HI> In Truth, 'tis e&s;pe|cially with an Eye to a better Country, that is, an <HI>hea|venly,</HI> into which the Saints are tran&s;lated finally, that <HI>GOD is</HI> &s;aid to be <HI>not a&s;hamed to be called their GOD:</HI> There it is that He be&s;tows <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> 'em perfect Happi|ne&s;s and Glory, according to the full Empha&s;is of this big Expre&s;&s;ion.

None indeed was ever (that we know of) tran&s;lated thi|ther in a Chariot of Fire, and without &s;eeing Death, &s;ave <HI>Elijah</HI> and <HI>Enoch,</HI> and perhaps few have a greater Re|ward in Heaven: Yet every <HI>Saint</HI> arrives as &s;afe, under the Conduct of good Angels, in the World of happy Spirits, tho' by the common and inferior Road of Mor|tality, and every faithful <HI>Prophet</HI> meets a glorious &s;ignal Reward in the Man&s;ions above. In the City of God there are different Degrees of Happine&s;s, a Diver&s;ity of Privileges and Honours. And the ble&s;&s;ed God will decree a very advanced Glory and Felicity to his holy Prophets, di&s;criminating them in their future Recompen|ces, in Proportion to the varying Mea&s;ures of their pre&s;ent Improvements in real Holine&s;s, and of their in|tended Services, if not their actual U&s;efulne&s;s in this World. <HI>Peter,</HI> an in&s;pired Prophet and Apo&s;tle, not only hopes him&s;elf to be a Partaker of the future Glory,

As the a&s;pectable Heavens in their &s;everal Parts vary to our Eye in their Degrees of Light and Splendor: So likewi&s;e is it with the Saints in their &s;e|parate State, and in the Re&s;urrection-World. <HI>They</HI> (&s;ays the Prophet) <HI>that are wi&s;e</HI> (wi&s;e to Salvation of their own Souls) <HI>&s;hall &s;hine as the Brightne&s;s of the</HI> FIR|MAMENT (which is a great, yet fainter Brightne&s;s) <HI>and they that have turned many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> (&s;o approving them&s;elves wi&s;e to win others Souls) <HI>&s;hall &s;hine forth as the STARS</HI> (with a &s;uperiour and more remarkable Lu&s;tre) <HI>for ever and ever.</HI> The SUN of Righteou&s;ne&s;s will &s;hine on &s;uch with his &s;uperlatively &s;plendid and be|nign Rays: and the SAVIOUR will expre&s;s the GOD to them in a mo&s;t tran&s;cendent Manner, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them of the &s;ublime&s;t Happine&s;s, and transforming them into the Image of his own Glory, with a peculiar Perfection and Eminence that &s;hall put a vi&s;ible eternal Di&s;tinction upon them.</P>

But then at the &s;ame time it &s;hou'd awaken a holy <HI>Fear</HI> in their Souls, to con&s;ider the awful <HI>Vows</HI> of God which are upon them.</P>
<P>Tho' the Children of Mini&s;ters in Go&s;pel-Days are not <HI>holy to the LORD,</HI> in the &s;ame peculiar Sen&s;e, as were the Sons of <HI>Levi</HI> under the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation: yet they are &s;o in a Sen&s;e, at lea&s;t in that common to all Children of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Parents; &s;eparated from a World lying in Wickedne&s;s, externally call'd with an holy Vocation, devoted to GOD as his vi&s;ible Children, and engag'd to honour Him by all <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Duty and Ser|vice. Yea, the <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI>'s Standing in the Church of God (as well as the Advantage of an Education in a Family well-order'd, as his ought to be) &s;eems to rai&s;e and increa&s;e the &s;olemn Obligations upon <HI>his</HI> Children to a very virtuous, holy and heavenly Life. It's re|quir'd of the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> (1 Tim. 3.4.) <HI>That he rule well his own Hou&s;e, having his Children in Subjection with all Gra|vity</HI>; and (Tit. 1.6.) <HI>Having faithful Children:</HI> which not only &s;peaks the Parent's Obligation, but hints al&s;o the <HI>Chil|dren</HI>'s Duty. As it is expected of Mini&s;ters, that they &s;hew them&s;elves Patterns of good Works in general, and of re|lative Duties in particular: &s;o it's expected, that <HI>their Fa|milies</HI> (above all the Families in <HI>I&s;rael)</HI> be Patterns of De|votion, Order, Unity, Sobriety, Gravity.
