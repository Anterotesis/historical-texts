<P>THE in&s;pir'd Evangeli&s;t clo&s;es his entertain|ing Narrative of the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles</HI> with this remarkable and in&s;tructive Pa&s;|&s;age in the Story of the great <HI>Doctor of the Gentiles:</HI> who, from a De&s;troyer of the Faith and Per&s;ecutor of Chri&s;t, had long &s;ince, by the Grace of God be&s;towed upon him, become an Apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t, and Preacher of the Faith, yea a Sufferer for the Go&s;pel; and was now evangelizing the famous City of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="004510_0004_100D5E3185B332B0">
It had been foretold him in a Vi&s;ion, that as he had te&s;tified of Chri&s;t at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> he &s;hould bear Witne&s;s at <HI>Rome</HI> al&s;o. He had him&s;elf promis'd, and once and again purpos'd a Vi&s;it to the <HI>Romans;</HI> longing to <HI>have &s;ome Fruit among them, even as among other Gentiles.</HI> But being oblig'd to delay for a while, it &s;eems as if &s;ome had tax'd him of <HI>u&s;ing Lightne&s;s,</HI> in promi&s;ing and not per|forming; or we may &s;uppo&s;e they might (like &s;ome at <HI>Corinth</HI> ) be <HI>puffed up, as though he would not come to them,</HI> either for Fear or Shame. Therefore he takes Occa&s;ion in his <HI>Epi&s;tle to the Romans</HI> (written while yet unknown by Face unto them) to make tho&s;e &s;olemn Prote&s;tations: <HI>I am a Debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, both to the Wi&s;e and to the Unwi&s;e; &s;o, as much as in me is, I am</HI> READY <HI>to preach the Go&s;pel to You that are at</HI> Rome <HI>al&s;o: for I am</HI> NOT ASHAMED <HI>of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.&mdash;From</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>and round about unto</HI> Illyricum, <HI>I have</HI> FULLY <HI>preached the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. And I am</HI> SURE, <HI>that when I come unto You, I &s;hall come in the</HI> FULNESS <HI>of the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Agreably the Apo&s;tle was no &s;ooner arrived among them, altho' under &s;ome uncomfortable Re&s;traints and manife&s;t Di&s;advantages, but he enters with Alacrity into this new Scene of Labours in the Word, &s;hewing him|&s;elf (as he had wrote) <HI>not a&s;hamed of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> but <HI>ready to preach</HI> it even at <HI>Rome;</HI> neither re|garding the Envy of any judaizing fal&s;e Brethren of his own Communion there, nor the Malice of the unbelieving Jews; neither fearing the Power of pagan Idolaters, nor all the Sophi&s;try of the Di&s;puters of this World. Fle&s;h and Blood indeed, had he con&s;ulted that, might have prompted him to Silence, as a prudent Caution, and the be&s;t Security, in his pre&s;ent critical Situation; being under a judicial Pro&s;ecution by his own Countrymen, condemned by the Jewi&s;h Prie&s;ts as violating their Law and the Cu&s;toms of their Fathers, and upon his Appeal to <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> con&s;ign'd over into the Hands of the <HI>Romans.</HI>&mdash;But our chri&s;tian Hero, at all Hazards, quickly begins his Te&s;timony in <HI>Rome:</HI> and cea&s;ed not daily to teach and preach <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> He had too

active a Genius, and too ju&s;t a Sen&s;e of the Worth of Time, to &s;weel away any of his precious Hours in Sloth and Indolence; He had a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Compa&s;&s;ion for guilty peri&s;hing Souls, and he felt the Love of Chri&s;t pow|erfully con&s;training him; Nece&s;&s;ity was laid upon him; and he found the Spirit of Glory and of God now re&s;ting on him: So that, thus principl'd, thus fortify'd and ani|mated, he apply'd him&s;elf to the Work of an Apo&s;tle without Delay, and pur&s;ued it with a &s;teady Re&s;olution, with ardent Zeal, and an indefatigable Indu&s;try; being in it &s;ometimes <HI>from Morning till Evening,</HI> and continual|ly in Labours more abundant. From <HI>Rome</HI> he &s;eems to have wrote almo&s;t all his Epi&s;tles. And here he &s;eems to have eminently devoted him&s;elf to the Mini&s;try of the Word: <HI>preaching and teaching with all Confidence;</HI> and in|deed <HI>no Man forbidding him.</HI></P>
<P>Liberty was indulg'd him by the Authority of the Place: And tho' he wanted not for Adver&s;aries, they wanted the Courage or the Power to <HI>forbid</HI> and with&s;tand him. Par|ticularly the Men of his own Nation, who &s;eem every where to have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for their Spleen and Rancour again&s;t this Apo&s;tle, and often had made Up|roar, and In&s;urrection, and Con&s;piracy again&s;t him in his own Country, wou'd doubtle&s;s now al&s;o at <HI>Rome,</HI> if their Power had been equal to their Will, have thunder'd out Menaces and Prohibitions, and laid all po&s;&s;ible Ob&s;truc|tions in the Way, to prevent his <HI>&s;peaking in the Name of Je&s;us,</HI> or his preaching among the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> But <HI>Paul, a Pri&s;oner of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and a Stranger at <HI>Rome,</HI> happily found more Indulgence here, than at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> being by the Favour of the <HI>Roman</HI> Captain &s;uffered to <HI>dwell by him&s;elf</HI> (with a &s;ingle Attendant) <HI>in his own hired Hou&s;e,</HI> to admit what Company he pleas'd, to preach as often as he would; and none permitted to di&s;turb him.</P>
<P>[By the Way, here's a teaching <HI>Example</HI> to Men in Power, to countenance faithful Preachers of the Go&s;pel: and how can per&s;ecuting <HI>Rome</HI> at this Day, reflect on it without Blu&s;hing and Confu&s;ion!]</P>
<P>This Liberty afforded the Apo&s;tle a glorious Oppor|tunity: which he well knew how to value, and neg|lected not to make U&s;e of to the be&s;t Advantage. A
<PB N="4" REF="004510_0006_100D5E35F903DB10">
wide Door, and effectual, was here open'd to him, to &s;end abroad the Sound of the Go&s;pel: he quickly filled <HI>Rome</HI> with this Doctrine, and it reach'd even <HI>Cae&s;ar'</HI>s Hou&s;ehold. Some of all Stations, Characters, and Cir|cum&s;tances (it &s;eems) crouded to his Mini&s;try, as the Doves flock to their Windows: And 'tis &s;aid here, like his Divine Ma&s;ter, <HI>he receiv'd all that came to him;</HI> whether Jew or Gentile, whether Male or Female, Old or Young, Bond or Free, Wi&s;e or Unwi&s;e: he re|garded no Man's Per&s;on; he <HI>received all</HI> indifferently, without partial Re&s;pects or Di&s;repects, for their Nation, Condition, Rank, or Figure in the World. And <HI>how</HI> did he <HI>receive</HI> them? Was it only to good Fellow&s;hip, to pa&s;s away the Time together in empty Chatt and trifling Amu&s;ements! No.&mdash;Or was it to doubtful Di&s;putati|ons, to &s;chola&s;tick Babblings, and Oppo&s;itions of Sci|ence, fal&s;ely &s;o call'd! No.&mdash;Or was it to mercenary and &s;elfi&s;h Ends, hoping for Money, or for Favour from 'em! No, nor this. But it was in pure Love, from a ge|nerous and di&s;intere&s;ted Zeal for their Good, hoping to win their Souls to Chri&s;t, and bring them to God. With this noble View he <HI>received</HI> them all. All that had Ears to hear, He receiv'd, to <HI>preach</HI> to them, and to <HI>teach</HI> them, as <HI>Je&s;us</HI> (it's &s;aid) <HI>received the People, and &s;pake to them of the Kingdom of God.</HI> And this he did with great Fi|delity, Freedom and A&s;&s;urance; not a&s;ham'd of his Doctrine, nor balking the Truth; not &s;paring Vice, Error, or any Thing contrary to &s;ound Doctrine; neither flattering the Vanity of the Great or Learned, nor de&s;pi&s;ing the humble Condition of the Poor, or Illiterate. That's the Character of this Divine Apo&s;tle, in our Text; <HI>Preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching tho&s;e Things which concern the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with all Con|fidence.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2. The <HI>Manner</HI> of his <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Teaching,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>with all</HI> CONFIDENCE.</P>
<P>A Door was now open'd to him of the Lord; a Door of Opportunity, and a Door of Utterance: and he &s;pake <HI>boldly</HI> the My&s;teries of God. Sometimes he remarks it to the Churches, that he had been <HI>with them in Weakne&s;s, and in Fear, and in much Trembling:</HI> tho' never to that Degree as to hinder him from declaring to them the Te&s;timony of God, and triumphing in Chri&s;t. It &s;eems, even in&s;pir'd <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> had not the Pre&s;ence of the Comfor|ter with them always in an exact Proportion. But in &s;ome Places, and on &s;ome Occa&s;ions, they had the <HI>Joy of the Holy Gho&s;t</HI> in &s;ignal Mea&s;ures, &s;o that at &s;uch times they remarkably <HI>waxed bold:</HI> and never perhaps was <HI>Paul</HI> more <HI>thorowly made manife&s;t,</HI> than among the <HI>Romans.</HI> His Speech and his Preaching was now very eminently <HI>in Demon&s;tration of the Spirit, and of Power.</HI> His Faith &s;eems now triumphant, and to &s;pread all its Glories upon him. He needed a peculiar Pre&s;ence of God, to &s;upport him under the Weight of that uncommon Service (private, as well as publick) which he mu&s;t have upon his Hands in &s;o great and populous a City, while <HI>all</HI> Comers at all Sea&s;ons had free Acce&s;s to him.&mdash;Here too he had &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;ubtle and powerful <HI>Adver&s;aries,</HI> to conflict with; Here he had his <HI>Martyrdom</HI> in the neare&s;t Pro&s;|pect; and here one of the bittere&s;t Trials was to befall
<PB N="6" REF="004510_0008_100D5E3AC55CE4F0">
him, the <HI>De&s;ertion of Friends:</HI> on all which Accounts, as he remarkably needed <HI>his Lord to &s;tand by him, and &s;trengthen him,</HI> &s;o he had now a very remarkable Expe|rience of the gracious Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t, which gave him Utterance and a Fortitude extraordinary. So that even in learned proud and imperious <HI>Rome</HI> he <HI>was</HI> bold in his God, to make known the My&s;teries of the Go&s;pel; and preach'd Chri&s;tianity with much Power, with a victorious Faith, and intrepid A&s;&s;urance. He preach'd the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> tho' amid&s;t <HI>Idol-Temples,</HI> and near the Palace of <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> as jealous as he was for the Dignity of his Crown, or the Prie&s;ts and Populace for the Honour of their Idols. The Apo&s;tle, while he was for allowing to <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> the Things that were <HI>Ce&s;ar'</HI>s, yet boldly claim'd for GOD the Things that are GOD'S, and for CHRIST the Things that are CHRIST'S, in Oppo&s;ition to the Works of the Devil, and the U&s;urpations of Men. He dar'd preach the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> in the <HI>Imperial</HI> City, the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the World, and the Mother of Abomina|tions. And here he triumph'd in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> tho' de&s;pi&s;ed of Men. He glory'd in the <HI>Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> though to the <HI>Jews</HI> a Stumbling-block, and to the <HI>Greeks</HI> Fooli&s;hne&s;s. They might pour Contempt on the Doctrine of a <HI>crucify'd Saviour,</HI> and a <HI>Kingdom not of this World&punc;</HI> but he &s;aw a Divine Glory in the Go&s;pel, and counting all Things but Lo&s;s, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Je&s;us, he <HI>preach'd the Things concerning Chri&s;t, and the Kingdom of God, with all Confidence,</HI> with the full A&s;&s;urance of Faith, and the Rejoicing of Hope firm to the End; free from all anxious Diffidence, Reluctance, Fear, or Shame; and &s;urmounting all Di&s;couragements.</P>
<P>Perhaps (by the Way) this his heroic <HI>Confidence</HI> might be one Occa&s;ion of that happy Circum&s;tance, <HI>No Man forbidding him:</HI> for they might as well attempt to &s;tay the Sun in the Heavens from its Cour&s;e, as go about to forbid the Progre&s;s of this bold and zealous Preacher in his Work, who like the Sun was a burning and &s;hining Light, and in the daily Revolutions of his Mini&s;try went forth in the Strength of the Lord, rejoicing as a &s;trong Man to run a Race. But <HI>the good Hand of his God upon him,</HI> is principally to be ey'd in this remarkable
<PB N="7" REF="004510_0009_100D5E3CED45EB88">
Concurrence of Events; the Boldne&s;s of the Apo&s;tle, and the Tamene&s;s of his Adver&s;aries. The God that &s;topt the Mouths of ravening Lions, in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Daniel,</HI> made all Iniquity to &s;top her Mouth, in the Ca&s;e of this Apo&s;tle, and <HI>delivered him out of the Mouth of the Lion.</HI> So it was that God, who maketh Man's Mouth; even He, who put forth his Hand, and touched <HI>Jeremiah'</HI>s Mouth; He, who &s;ent one of the Seraphim, with a live-Coal from off the Altar, to touch <HI>I&s;aiah'</HI>s Lips, and made his Mouth like a &s;harp Sword; 'twas the &s;ame Hand of God, that open'd the Mouth of this Apo|&s;tle, and gave him that good Trea&s;ure he had within, of Knowledge, Grace and Comfort, &s;o that out of the Abundance of his Heart, his Mouth &s;pake, <HI>of the King|dom of God, and the Things which concern the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with all Confidence.</HI></P>

PROP. I. The Go&s;pel reveals to us <HI>the Kingdom of God and tho&s;e Things which concern the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Here it may be &s;aid di&s;tinctly,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Go&s;pel reveals to us <HI>the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>And if it be inquired, <HI>What</HI> Kingdom? I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">(1). It reveals to us a Kingdom of <HI>Providence,</HI> which extends thro' the univer&s;al <HI>Creation.</HI></P>
<P>It tells us, that <HI>God hath prepared his Throne in the Hea|vens, and his Kingdom ruleth over all:</HI> reaches thro' all Worlds, Heaven, Earth, and Hell. The Doctrine of a Divine Providence is the Dictate of Rea&s;on, as well as Revelation: tho' the Glories of this Providential Do|minion are vail'd to the Eye of natural Rea&s;on. It ap|pears but <HI>a ba&s;e Kingdom,</HI> without the Go&s;pel to &s;hew us the My&s;teries of it.&mdash;Nor can we by the Light of Na|ture learn <HI>the Manner of the Kingdom,</HI> as admini&s;tred by <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the Mediator; to whom all Power in Heaven and Earth is committed, and who hath the Keys of Hell and of Death. This is one of the <HI>Peculiars</HI> of Reve|lation: a Doctrine of Chri&s;tianity, full of My&s;tery and Glory, and big with Le&s;&s;ons of Duty.&mdash;But it is not the Kingdom of <HI>Nature,</HI> the Dominion of <HI>Providence,</HI> in any View of it, that our Text has &s;o direct a Re|ference to.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Go&s;pel reveals to us a Kingdom of <HI>Grace,</HI> which extends only to the Church and peculiar People of God in the Earth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> &s;poken of in our Text, and which is &s;o celebrated a Subject in Revelation, means in general the Di&s;pen&s;ation of Redemption by Chri&s;t; and particu|larly that <HI>mediatory Dominion of Grace,</HI> which concerns <HI>Souls</HI> in this World, and which our <HI>Lord-Redeemer</HI> ex|erci&s;es over them by his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>The Metaphor of a <HI>Kingdom</HI> is cho&s;en to &s;hadow out the <HI>Excellencies</HI> of this Di&s;pen&s;ation of Grace; and par|ticularly to repre&s;ent the glorious Rectitude, the beauti|ful and ble&s;&s;ed State of Things in a <HI>renewed Soul.</HI> It imports a Throne erected, a Divine Authority exerci&s;ed, and a Divine Power exerted; a Law written, Allegiance &s;worn, and Homage paid; a comely Order and Harmony re&s;tored; a Pardon di&s;pens'd, and Peace &s;poken; Privi|leges

I &s;hall now clo&s;e this Point with &s;ugge&s;ting a few practical <HI>Reflections.</HI></P>
<P>By this we &s;ee the <HI>forlorn</HI> and <HI>wretched</HI> State of Souls <HI>unregenerate,</HI> in that they are Strangers to the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> in this World; and continuing &s;o, mu&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> be excluded the Kingdom of God in the next.&mdash;By this we &s;ee how <HI>happy</HI> is the Day of a Sinner's <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> and the Occa&s;ion there is for <HI>Joy</HI> at every &s;piritual <HI>Birth,</HI> when a Soul is initiated into the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI>&mdash;We &s;ee the Rea&s;on of believing <HI>Parents</HI> &s;o anxiou&s;ly <HI>weeping for their Children</HI> while in a State of Nature, and <HI>travail|ing in Birth again, until Chri&s;t be formed in them, the Kingdom of God</HI> &s;et up in their Souls.&mdash;What <HI>honoura|ble</HI> Sentiments &s;hould we have of the <HI>Saints,</HI> th&ocirc; <HI>poor</HI> in this World, yet <HI>rich</HI> in Faith, and Heirs of the <HI>King|dom!</HI>&mdash;And what mutual <HI>Endearment</HI> ought there ever to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between all the&s;e! <HI>The&s;e,</HI> who are <HI>Compa|nions in the Kingdom and Patience of Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> here, and will hereafter be Companions for ever in the <HI>Kingdom and Joy of their Lord.</HI>&mdash;Let it be added; while we re|flect with Grief and Shame on our Apo&s;tacy and Fall in <HI>Adam</HI> (by whom came <HI>Sin</HI> into the World, and by this the Kingdom of the <HI>Devil,</HI> that wicked Spirit which rules in the Children of Di&s;obedience ever &s;ince) we &s;hou'd ad|mire and magnify the &s;tupendous Wi&s;dom and Grace of God in rai&s;ing up a <HI>&s;econd Adam,</HI> to repair the &s;uffering Honour of his violated Law, to dethrone the Enemy of our Souls, and <HI>re&s;tore the Kingdom to I&s;rael.</HI>&mdash;And &s;hou'd we not with equal Wonder and Prai&s;e celebrate the infi|nite <HI>Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t!</HI> who hath <HI>re&s;tored that which be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> not away,</HI> and has done this at the Ex|pence of his own precious <HI>Blood;</HI> by the Merit of which he <HI>purcha&s;ed</HI> the Kingdom of God, and in Virtue of which he receiv'd Power, in his ri&s;en State, to <HI>di&s;pen&s;e</HI> the hea|venly Ble&s;&s;ing to whom he will; even to <HI>as many as the Father hath given him</HI> for a peculiar People to him&s;elf.

Hence that of Chri&s;t to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appointed to me a Kingdom.</HI> And we read, <HI>Him hath God exalted with his right Hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance unto I&s;rael,

<P>But in many of the&s;e Hints I have been in&s;en&s;ibly an|ticipating the proper Thoughts on the other Article before us: which therefore I &s;hall be the briefer upon.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Go&s;pel reveals to us <HI>tho&s;e Things which concern the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>By the Light of Rea&s;on we have &s;ome Notions of the Being and Perfections of God, and his Kingdom of Pro|vidence: but <HI>the Kingdom of God,</HI> intended in our Text, and <HI>the Things that concern the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> (which do abundantly improve and add to rational Light in the Things of Nature and Providence) are di&s;coverable only by the &s;upernatural Light of Revelation. <HI>The Kingdom of God</HI> is a Kingdom of Grace, con&s;tituted and admini&s;tred <HI>according to the Coun&s;el of his own Will:</HI> And hence Di|vine Revelation was nece&s;&s;ary to the Knowledge of that. So <HI>the Things which concern the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> are Matters of pure Revelation: &s;uch as the natural Rea&s;on of Man cou'd never have brought to Light. 'Tis the ap|propriate Glory of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> to reveal the&s;e Things to the Sons of Men.</P>
<P>And what a rich Variety of Things, great and glorious <HI>Things concerning Chri&s;t,</HI> are di&s;covered to us in the Go&s;pel of his Grace! <HI>The Kingdom of God</HI> is a comprehen&s;ive Article among <HI>tho&s;e Things which concern the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and &s;ometimes they &s;eem all to be &s;um'd up in that. But the Apo&s;tle here adds a more exten&s;ive Phra&s;e, in order to include <HI>all other Things</HI> not &s;o evidently couch'd in the Idea of <HI>the Kingdom of God.</HI> The whole Reve|lation in &s;acred Writ, from <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> to the <HI>Apocalyp&s;e,</HI> is relative to CHRIST, in &s;ome Manner and Degree: But our Text eminently points us to tho&s;e Things which have

a more <HI>evident</HI> and <HI>next</HI> Reference to him in the Chri&s;tian Revelation.</P>
<P>Thus for In&s;tance, the Go&s;pel reveals to us the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> of Chri&s;t, as <HI>God manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h;</HI> his <HI>Office,</HI> as Me|diator, under the &s;everal Characters of a Prophet, and a Prie&s;t, as well as King; the <HI>Covenant of Redemption,</HI> and the Promi&s;es made to Him before the World began; the <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> of the <HI>Elect</HI> unto Life in and by him; the <HI>Types</HI> &amp; <HI>Prophecies</HI> of Him in old Time, and their punc|tual <HI>Accompli&s;hment</HI> in Him; the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> and <HI>My&s;tery</HI> of his Incarnation, Conception and Birth, his Life, Miracles and Sufferings, his Death and Re&s;urrection, his A&s;cen&s;ion into Glory, and &s;itting down at the right Hand of the Maje&s;ty in the Heavens; &s;o the <HI>Doctrine</HI> he taught, the Laws and In&s;titutes he made, the Promi&s;es he gave, whe|ther in Per&s;on, or by his in&s;pir'd Mini&s;ters; the Mi&s;&s;ion of his <HI>Spirit,</HI> as a Teacher, Sanctifier and Comforter, his &s;o|vereign Agency, and abiding Pre&s;ence; the Commi&s;&s;ion and In&s;piration of his <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> the Revelations made to them, and publi&s;hed by them, their Mini&s;try and Preach|ing, confirm'd with Signs and Wonders; his &s;etting up of the <HI>Go&s;pel-Church,</HI> demoli&s;hing the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Di&s;pen&s;a|tion, and vi&s;iting the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to take out of them a Peo|ple for his Name.&mdash;In brief, we have revealed to us the <HI>Example</HI> of Chri&s;t; his <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and his <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion</HI> in the Merit thereof; the un&s;earchable Riches of his <HI>Grace,</HI> and the ab&s;olute <HI>Sufficiency</HI> of his Power to &s;ave; the <HI>Way</HI> of Salvation by him, the <HI>Benefits</HI> we re|ceive from Him, and the <HI>Duties</HI> we owe to Him; his being the <HI>Head</HI> of his Body, the Church, and Head over all Things to the Church; his being appointed the <HI>Heir</HI> of all Things, and <HI>Judge</HI> of the World; his <HI>&s;econd</HI> Ap|pearing, his <HI>rai&s;ing</HI> the Dead, and di&s;pen&s;ing both Rewards and Puni&s;hments everla&s;ting.&mdash;This is an incomplete and immethodical Ab&s;tract of <HI>tho&s;e Things which concern the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> I pretend not to an exact and perfect Enumeration: much le&s;s to a perfect Comprehen&s;ion of the Meaning of all the&s;e Things. But when I meditate them, I &s;oon find my &s;elf lo&s;t in Wonder, and can't or|der my Speech by rea&s;on of Darkne&s;s. <HI>Without Contro|ver&s;y,</HI> GREAT <HI>is the My&s;tery of Godline&s;s,</HI> the My&s;tery of

<P>PROP. II. <HI>Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are to</HI> preach <HI>the King|dom of God, and</HI> teach <HI>tho&s;e Things which concern the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Our Text tells us, the Apo&s;tle did &s;o; tis remark'd of of him twice in this Chapter, and often el&s;ewhere: and this is recorded <HI>for our Admonition,</HI> upon whom the Ends of the World are come.&mdash;Here let it be &s;aid briefly,</P>
<P N="1">1. We mu&s;t preach the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> revealed in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Our Context &s;peaks of <HI>Paul's expounding</HI> and <HI>te&s;tifying the Kingdom of God.</HI> And we read (Chap. 19. 9.) of his <HI>daily di&s;puting, and per&s;uading the Things concerning the Kingdom of God.</HI> Even thus Mini&s;ters mu&s;t labour (every one, as of the Ability, which God giveth) to <HI>te&s;tify,</HI> and <HI>expound,</HI> al&s;o (if need be) to <HI>di&s;pute,</HI> and <HI>per&s;uade</HI> the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>We &s;hould <HI>te&s;tify</HI> the Kingdom of God, a&s;&s;erting its Reality and Exi&s;tence; and it will be well, if we are able to <HI>witne&s;s</HI> unto this from our own happy <HI>Experience.</HI> So we mu&s;t <HI>expound</HI> it, as we are able, in its whole Extent and Compa&s;s; its Nature, its Properties, and Purpo&s;es; the Laws and Benefits of it; the Promi&s;es concerning it; and the <HI>Truths</HI> relating to it, or in&s;eparably connected with it; particularly the Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> that Truth which is &s;o evidently fundamental to the Scheme of Chri&s;|tianity, and without a due Attention to which we &s;hall be likely to entertain very crude Conceptions of the <HI>King|dom of God;</HI> al&s;o the Doctrine of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> its Ne|ce&s;&s;ity re&s;ulting from Original Sin, its Author the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> its Fruits in the chri&s;tian Life, its e&s;&s;ential Con|nection with eternal Happine&s;s, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> without a ju&s;t Re|gard to which important Points, we &s;hall have but very &s;uperficial Notions of the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI> Hence, if we

wou'd <HI>expound,</HI> as we ought, the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> we &s;hould &s;tudy and preach the&s;e great Go&s;pel-Truths.&mdash;We mu&s;t likewi&s;e be ready even to <HI>di&s;pute,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle did, and <HI>contend earne&s;tly for the Faith,</HI> in regard of <HI>the Things pertaining to the Kingdom of God;</HI> with Meekne&s;s and Wi&s;dom in&s;tructing &s;uch as oppo&s;e them&s;elves; labouring to convince Gain&s;ayers, and put them to Silence. We mu&s;t contend again&s;t all the <HI>Enemies</HI> of the Kingdom of God; <HI>wre&s;tle again&s;t Fle&s;h and Blood,</HI> and again&s;t <HI>&s;piri|tual Wickedne&s;&s;es in high Places; re&s;i&s;t the Devil and the World,</HI> Vice and Error, in all their various Forms, with the <HI>Sword of the Spirit,</HI> the Word of Truth.&mdash;And like the Apo&s;tle, we mu&s;t al&s;o <HI>per&s;uade</HI> the Things concerning the Kingdom of God; rea&s;oning with Men out of the Scriptures, to convince them of the Folly of Rebellion, and the Wi&s;dom of Submi&s;&s;ion to God; exhorting and calling Men to a profe&s;&s;ed Subjection, and Obedience to the Go&s;|pel: as <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hewed to the Gentiles, <HI>that they &s;pou'd repent, and turn to God, and do Works meet for Repen|tance:</HI> He <HI>te&s;tified both to Jews, and Greeks, Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> And the Di&s;ciples he <HI>per&s;uaded to continue in the Grace of God,</HI> bringing forth the Fruits of the Kingdom, the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which are by Je&s;us Chri&s;t to the Prai&s;e and Glory of God.</P>
<P>In a Word, we mu&s;t teach <HI>the Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> This enters into the Notion of preaching the Kingdom of God. The adorable <HI>Trinity</HI> all concur in the Di&s;pen&s;ation of Redemption; acting each his di&s;tinct Part in the Affairs of this Kingdom: and &s;o far as Divine Revelation will carry us, we mu&s;t <HI>te&s;tify, expound,</HI> and <HI>per&s;uade</HI> the&s;e Things, as <HI>Things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</HI> We mu&s;t preach the <HI>Father of Mercies</HI> and <HI>God of all Grace:</HI> we mu&s;t preach the <HI>Spirit of Holine&s;s:</HI> and we mu&s;t preach the <HI>Lord of Glory.</HI> While we remember the <HI>Creator,</HI> we mu&s;t never forget the <HI>Redeemer,</HI> and the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">:</HI> but di&s;play their &s;everal Glories, and a&s;&s;ert their re&s;pective Rights.

<P>The Ideas are &s;omewhat di&s;tinct, yet &s;o united, as mu|tually to involve one the other: and it &s;eems to me, there's no forming any ju&s;t Notions of <HI>either</HI> Subject, without com|pri&s;ing <HI>both.</HI> While we preach the true <HI>Scripture-Doctrine</HI> on the one head, we do indeed implicitly teach the other: But it's abundantly be&s;t to be <HI>explicit,</HI> in preaching both together. This is to preach after the Manner of the <HI>Apo|&s;tles,</HI> and primitive Mini&s;ters, as they were taught of God, and led by the Spirit. (See <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 12.&mdash;<HI>Chap.</HI> 19. 8, 10. and Context <HI>ver.</HI> 23. with many other Places.) <HI>They</HI> are the proper Standard of Evangelic Preaching<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Go&s;pel indeed <HI>at the fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in his per&s;onal Mini&s;try: But the <HI>Confirmation</HI> and <HI>full Declaration</HI> of it was left to his <HI>Spirit,</HI> &s;peaking by the Mouth of the Apo&s;tles, &amp; other in&s;pir'd Mini&s;ters, after our Lord's A&s;cen&s;ion. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> indeed, when he was ri&s;en, abode forty Days on Earth, <HI>&s;peaking</HI> to his Di&s;ciples <HI>of the Things pertaining to the</HI> KINGDOM <HI>of God,</HI> &amp; <HI>expounding to them, in all the Scrip|tures, the Things concerning</HI> HIMSELF: But tho&s;e Di&s;|cour&s;es of his, the Holy Gho&s;t hath not been pleas'd to put on Record.

<P>It's Pity a Mini&s;ter &s;hou'd at any time lay the Plan of his Di&s;cour&s;e on <HI>one</HI> of the&s;e Subjects, &s;o as to <HI>preclude</HI> the other: and much wor&s;e it is, if he ever makes a Sermon without any explicit Regard to <HI>either</HI> of them. This (in plainne&s;s of Speech) is to <HI>handle the Word of God deceitful|ly:</HI> and no Apology can in any mea&s;ure ju&s;tify &s;uch' Ma|nagement.&mdash;Every &s;uitable Theme of a Pulpit-Di&s;cour&s;e is reducible under one or other of the&s;e Heads, improvable to &s;erve the Purpo&s;es of both, or capable of receiving Illu&s;|tration and Enforcement from them. Whatever our <HI>Text</HI> is, the Things of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and the Things of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> may with the utmo&s;t Propriety and Pertinence be introdu|ced, either under the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> or the <HI>Application;</HI> and it will be a mo&s;t faulty Omi&s;&s;ion, in any Di&s;cour&s;e to pa&s;s them wholly in Silence.&mdash;The Strain of our Preaching &s;hou'd turn upon <HI>one</HI> or <HI>other</HI> of the&s;e Evangelic Subjects: frequently we &s;hou'd con&s;ider them <HI>both together,</HI> pre&s;ent|ing them in one complex View: and when di&s;cour&s;ing on <HI>either</HI> of them more <HI>directly,</HI> yet always remember their <HI>Connection</HI> and mutual Dependance, &amp; accordingly con&s;ider the one in its <HI>Reference</HI> and <HI>Sub&s;erviency</HI> to the other.</P>
<P>In this Method of Preaching we &s;hall be likely to <HI>declare the whole Coun&s;el of God,</HI> and <HI>not keep back any Thing that is profitable,</HI> whether as to the Doctrinals or the Practicals of Revelation.&mdash;In this Way we &s;hall lead our Hearers into the mo&s;t <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> Notions of the Go&s;pel, in the Variety of its rich Contents.&mdash;In this Way, we &s;hall <HI>&s;hew our &s;elves approved unto God, Work|men that need not be a&s;hamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</HI>&mdash;And this is the Way <HI>to commend our &s;elves unto every Man's Con&s;cience in the Sight of God,</HI> to &s;uit every one's Reli&s;h, and to hit every one's Ca&s;e, in the Multiplicity we have to do with.&mdash;This is the Way to pre&s;erve the

It's Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s is not after the manner of earthly Kingdoms, with mighty Noi&s;e, O&s;tentation, and outward Shew: but it has its &s;ecret Sub&s;i&s;tence in the Soul, makes a &s;ilent Entrance, and its Glory is invi&s;ible to the bodily Eye.&mdash;Indeed, in a Sen&s;e it may be &s;aid to <HI>come with Ob&s;ervation,</HI> e&s;pecially in &s;ome Ca&s;es, when u&s;her'd in by a remarkable Train of preparatory Convictions, when ma|king an illu&s;trious Progre&s;s, and di&s;playing it &s;elf in very triumphant &s;piritual Victories and Succe&s;&s;es, drawing At|tention and exciting Admiration.&mdash;In a Sen&s;e it may be &s;aid to have an <HI>external Shew,</HI> as outward Means, the Word and Ordinances, under the Conduct of the Spirit, are employ'd in the Admini&s;tration of it; and as the <HI>King|dom of God,</HI> when it comes with <HI>Power,</HI> always produces ob&s;ervable Effects in the outward Life.&mdash;But &s;till it mu&s;t ever be kept in Mind, that its Seat is in the <HI>hidden</HI> Man, its principal Operations are <HI>un&s;een,</HI> and its Glory lies all in <HI>Spirituals.</HI>&mdash;How great is the My&s;tery of this Kingdom! How tran&s;cendent its Dignity and Benefit! Let us main|tain high and honourable Conceptions of it. And as tho&s;e that have a rais'd Opinion of its Worth and Advantages, let us wi&s;h its Pro&s;perity, its exten&s;ive Spread thro' all the Earth, and its more flouri&s;hing State where it is. That mu&s;t be our daily fervent Petition, <HI>Thy Kingdom come.</HI></P>
<P>And let it be remember'd, that <HI>the Things concerning Chri&s;t</HI> are related to this <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and contribute to advance it. The Foundation, the Security, the Genius of this King|dom, is <HI>Truth,</HI> the Truth as in <HI>Je&s;us.</HI>&mdash;The Doctrine

of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is a Doctrine <HI>according to Godline&s;s.</HI> Let us value it for its practical Tendency, as well as Divine Sublimity. Let us <HI>&s;earch for Knowledge</HI> in this, <HI>as for hid Trea&s;ures.</HI> Let our own and others Ignorance and Slight of the&s;e Things be the Matter of our mournful Regret: and let it be for a Lamentation, that there is in general no greater Appearance of the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> and of a Regard to the <HI>Things of Chri&s;t,</HI> prevailing among us. But what <HI>Tokens for Good</HI> may be &s;een at this Day, in &s;ome hopeful Begin|nings among our &s;elves, and the Tidings of Joy we have from other Parts, both in <HI>Europe</HI> &amp; <HI>America,</HI> the&s;e chal|lenge our thankful Notice.</P>
<P>USE 2. Let what has been &s;aid, be apply'd by way of Incentive and Direction in the great Duty of <HI>Self-Exami|nation.</HI></P>
<P>What will it profit, my Brethren, to have <HI>the Kingdom of God, and the Things that concern Chri&s;t,</HI> preach'd to us, unle&s;s, we have experienc'd indeed the inward and vital Di&s;pen&s;ation hereof by the Spirit of Grace!

<P>Have we ever had a thorow Conviction of our <HI>mi&s;erable</HI> State by <HI>Nature?</HI> Been made to &s;ee and bewail our Fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> and to <HI>know the Plague of our own Heart?</HI> To &s;ee our &s;elves under the <HI>Power of Satan</HI> and the Rule of Sin, <HI>hateful</HI> to God, and under the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> of his Law? To &s;ee the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of a <HI>Change</HI> of our State? To &s;ee our utter <HI>Impotence</HI> to deliver our own Souls, and our utter <HI>Unworthine&s;s</HI> of Divine Relief?&mdash;And has this View of our wretched Ca&s;e had its genuine Influence, to <HI>humble</HI> our Pride, and bring us to <HI>abhor</HI> our&s;elves?&mdash;Have we <HI>beheld the Maje&s;ty of God,</HI> and been <HI>per&s;uaded by the Terrors of the Lord,</HI> to throw our &s;elves at the Foot of &s;overeign Mercy?&mdash;Have we <HI>as in a Gla&s;s beheld the Glory of</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>heard his Voice and &s;een his Shape at any Time?</HI> Have we heard Him &s;peaking to our <HI>inner Man,</HI> &s;earching the Secrets of it, and in&s;tructing our very Reins? While the external Word has been &s;ounding in our Ears, has there been an <HI>inward</HI> Word &s;poken to our <HI>Hearts,</HI> making them even <HI>burn</HI> within us?&mdash;Has the <HI>Spirit,</HI> who&s;e Office it is to glorify the Son, <HI>taken of the Things of Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>&s;hewn

them to us?</HI>&mdash;Are we <HI>of the Truth,</HI> on the Side &amp; under the Power of Truth, <HI>the Truth which came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</HI>&mdash;Have we felt <HI>the Love of Chri&s;t con&s;training us,</HI> to &s;ubmit our&s;elves to his <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and his <HI>Yoke;</HI> to receive Him in all his Offices, and for all his Benefits; to prize Commu|nion with Him; to love his Image, wherever we &s;ee it; to follow his Example, obey his Will, and &s;eek his Glory; and long to <HI>dwell in our Ma&s;ter's Joy,</HI> free from all <HI>Sin,</HI> as well as Sorrow, and perfect in <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> for ever?</P>
<P>Let Con&s;cience give a faithful An&s;wer to the&s;e Que&s;tions. Let us expo&s;tulate with our &s;elves in &s;olemn manner; at the &s;ame time depending on, and imploring the Aids of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Comforter:</HI> and let us employ our utmo&s;t Cau|tion, that we ben't deluded, by groundle&s;s Pre&s;umptions, into a fal&s;e Peace in this World, and eternal Perdition in the next. O what an awful Thing will it be for us, when we've been flattering our&s;elves with Dreams of the <HI>King|dom of God,</HI> to find our &s;elves at la&s;t in the <HI>Kingdom of Darkne&s;s!</HI> to &s;ink from the Views and Hopes of <HI>Heaven,</HI> into the Horror and De&s;pair of Hell!

<P>USE 3. Let <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> be reminded of the <HI>Le&s;&s;ons of Duty</HI> taught them by the Example in our Text.</P>
<P>We al&s;o are &s;ent to <HI>preach the Kingdom of God</HI> and the <HI>Things concerning Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e were the exalted Themes of the in&s;pir'd <HI>Apo&s;tle'</HI>s Mini&s;try.&mdash;The&s;e are Things which <HI>the Angels de&s;ire to look into.</HI> The <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> when in the Spirit mu|&s;ing upon them, tho't his Heart was <HI>inditing good Matter,</HI> &amp; when he &s;pake of the Things which he had made <HI>touching the King,</HI> his Tongue was <HI>as the Pen of a ready Writer.</HI> Surely the&s;e are Things every way worthy to be &s;tudy'd and preach'd.&mdash;Such Preaching is eminently &s;uited to the Go&s;pel-Di&s;pen&s;ation, its Spirit and De&s;ign, and to the End of our Mini&s;try, the Glory of Chri&s;t, in the Conver&s;ion and Edification of Souls; peculiarly adapted to the Wants of Sinners, and to the Gu&s;t of Saints.&mdash;Let us therefore, my Fathers and Brethren, be careful to lay out our Labours
<PB N="43" REF="004510_0045_100D5E8DA496BAD0">
in the Word and Doctrine, on the&s;e great and important Subjects. Let none have Occa&s;ion to complain, that <HI>of the Matter of the Kingdom we told 'em not,</HI> or that we <HI>cea&s;ed to preach and teach Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash;Sad it is, if any of us have been wanting here, or if we need to have <HI>the Way of the Lord expounded</HI> even to our &s;elves <HI>more perfectly.</HI> O let us <HI>meditate on the&s;e Things,</HI> and <HI>give our &s;elves wholly to them, that our profiting may appear unto all.</HI>&mdash;Let them fill our Sermons; and not merely be drag'd in, to make a &s;ort of eccentric and glimmering Appearance now and then. We &s;hou'd take the Go&s;pel for our <HI>Vade Mecum. Let the Dead bury their Dead: but go thou, and preach the Kingdom of God. Go forth in the Strength of the Lord, and make Mention of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, even of his only.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e Things let us preach and teach <HI>with all Confidence;</HI> with all humble Confidence internal towards <HI>God,</HI> and external towards <HI>Men.</HI> We have the Example of the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> to countenance and quicken us.</P>
<P>And I can't forbear ob&s;erving here, We have in a fre&s;h In&s;tance &s;een this <HI>Pauline</HI> Spirit and Doctrine remarkably exemplify'd among us. We have &s;een <HI>a Preacher of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, fervent in Spirit, teaching diligently the Things of the Lord, cea&s;ing not</HI> even <HI>daily to preach the Kingdom of God,</HI> and <HI>the Things concerning Chri&s;t;</HI> and this <HI>with all Confidence.</HI> May I not &s;ay, that the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> he preach'd <HI>came not unto us in Word only, but in Power, and in the Holy Gho&s;t, and in much A&s;&s;urance? For your &s;elves, Bre|thren, know his Entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain!</HI>&mdash;And as for <HI>us,</HI> we have been &s;urpriz'd&mdash;We have been pleas'd&mdash;And &s;hall we not now &s;trive to imitate!&mdash;<HI>As every Man hath received the Gift, &s;o let him mini&s;ter the &s;ame.</HI> And as we've been <HI>put in Remembrance,</HI> let us <HI>&s;tir up the Gift of God in us.</HI>&mdash;Brethren, pray for us.</P>
<P>USE 4. Let what has been &s;aid, recommend to all of you, the <HI>diligent Study</HI> and <HI>delightful Contemplation</HI> of the&s;e Things.&mdash;Surely, the Matter of our Preaching is worthy to be the Matter of your Meditation.

<P>USE 6. Let me exhort &s;uch among you as are yet in your Sins, <HI>to give an earne&s;t Heed to the Things which you have heard.</HI></P>
<P>I hope, none of you will act as if I had been merely amu&s;ing you with a tedious Di&s;cour&s;e on in&s;ignificant Im|pertinences, and treat it accordingly with Coldne&s;s &amp; Neg|lect. Surely, the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> and <HI>the Things concern|ing Chri&s;t,</HI> are not Matters of empty Speculation, to be

Let none of you then be carele&s;s forgetful Hear|ers. Apply what has been &s;aid, to excite in you a ju&s;t Solicitude, that you may be found obeying that Call of our Saviour, Matth. 6. 33. <HI>Seek fir&s;t the</HI> KINGDOM <HI>of God and his</HI> RIGHTEOUSNESS.&mdash;Under&s;tand the Expre&s;|&s;ions as equivalent to tho&s;e in our <HI>Text.</HI></P>
