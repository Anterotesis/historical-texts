<Q><BIBL><HI>ESTHER 10.3.</HI></BIBL>
<P>FOR <HI>Mordecai</HI> the <HI>Jew</HI> was next unto King <HI>Aha&s;uerus,</HI> and great among the <HI>Jews;</HI> and accepted among the multitude of his brethren, &s;eeking the wealth of all his people, and &s;peak|ing peace to all his &s;eed.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE &s;acred &s;criptures, always in|tending the &s;anctification of &s;inful men, exhibit characters of various kinds; that there may be found in them, di&s;&s;ua&s;ives from vice and motives to godline&s;s, not only rational and forceable, but of peculiar influence upon every turn of mind.</P>
<P><PB REF="008452_0005_102F3209A897D880">THE principal per&s;ons in this book are <HI>Aha&s;uerus, Haman, E&s;ther</HI> and <HI>Mordecai.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aha&s;uerus</HI> king of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who&s;e dominion extended even from <HI>India</HI> to <HI>Ethiophia,</HI> over an hundred and twenty-&s;even provinces, was a monarch ve&s;ted with &s;uch unlimited power, as no wi&s;e man would be willing any one &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, below the character of a confirmed angel; at le&s;t any of the &s;inful race of fallen man; a power by edict to mur|der thou&s;ands of innocents in a day to gratify a favourite's pa&s;&s;ions; and a power able to perplex and di&s;tre&s;s the affairs of peaceable &s;tates round about, contented with their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and coveting no other.</P>
<P>AMBITION, pride and cruelty are the mo&s;t con&s;picuous marks in the character of <HI>Haman;</HI> who had crept into the monarch's favour above all others, and was likely to make a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing u&s;e of the ab&s;olute power which he could command.</P>
<P><HI>E&s;ther</HI> the queen, an orphan, without fa|ther or mother, but brought up by her near kin&s;man <HI>Mordecai,</HI> by the gift of nature, and her kin&s;man's pious paternal care, po&s;&s;e&s;t every lovely quality of the &s;ex, made more illu&s;trious by grace, which illu&s;trates virtue it &s;elf; and had merit enough with the mo|narch to be advanced to his bed upon the di|vorce of <HI>Va&s;hti,</HI> the former queen.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="008452_0006_102F320C0CB090D0">La&s;tly, THE character of <HI>Mordecai</HI> the Jew was truly excellent and great: from which, if I mi&s;take not, &s;omething may be inferred &s;utable to that part, which, thro' the ill health of my dearly beloved brother in Chri&s;t, is &s;o &s;uddenly and unexpectedly fallen to my lot upon this retured anniver&s;ary.</P>
<P>AND his character &s;eems to be that of a pious, ju&s;t, wi&s;e man, and &s;trictly tenacious of his purpo&s;e; a character in &s;ome danger of moro&s;ene&s;s: (&s;hould I be much mi&s;taken if I re&s;embled him to the roman <HI>Cato?</HI>) but yet, when &s;anctified by the divine &s;pirit, and influenced by the fear of God, a temper fitted for arduous undertakings, and to act &s;edately in &s;hocking di&s;a&s;ters.</P>
<P>HIS piety towards God is &s;een in his prayers, and in the prayers of his people by his direction under the queen, and their devout humiliations before God; a pious practice, always u&s;ed in dangerous times, in the church of God; which it becomes the religious rulers and leaders of his people to recommend and urge as a becoming acknow|ledgement of his care and government of the world, due for his glory, and the way to his mercy. It is al&s;o &s;een in his firm reliance upon God, the protector of his church, ex|pre&s;&s;ed in that me&s;&s;age to the queen: <HI>If thou altogether hold thy peace at this time,</HI> from ma|king
<PB N="8" REF="008452_0007_102F320DA0CD4EF0">
&s;upplication to the king, <HI>then &s;hall enlarge|ment and deliverance ari&s;e to the Jews from another place &mdash; and who knoweth whither thou art come to the kingdom for &s;uch a time as this.</HI></P>
<P>HIS ju&s;tice is vindicated and declared, as the &s;laughter of a great number of the enemies of the <HI>Jews</HI> was nece&s;&s;ary &s;elf-defence, and &s;tanding for their own lives; and in that when his enemies were in his power, and the law of retaliation might &s;eem to ju&s;tify the taking not only their lives, but their &s;poils, it is &s;aid more than once, <HI>on the prey they laid not their hands.</HI></P>
<P>HIS wi&s;dom appears in all his method to deliver his people from the ma&s;&s;acre intended by <HI>that wicked Haman:</HI> and his inflexibility in continuing in &s;ackcloth, which kept him from the queen's pre&s;ence, tho' called, and which the circum&s;tances of things &s;eemed greatly to require.</P>
<P>OUR text is the la&s;t ver&s;e in the book; and, for the encouragement of virtue in the &s;er|vice of God and his people, de&s;cribes the fe|licity of <HI>Mordecai</HI>'s condition after the diffi|culties and dangers he had pa&s;&s;ed thro'. <HI>He was next to the king;</HI> and the ambition of a &s;ubject can look no higher, nor the bene|volent mind wi&s;h for a better pro&s;pect of ex|ten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s. He was <HI>great among the
<PB N="9" REF="008452_0008_102F320F30D0AC70">
Jews:</HI> in true greatne&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed, and univer&s;ally honoured among them. <HI>And ac|cepted among the multitude of his brethren:</HI> his per&s;on re&s;pected, and his &s;ervices well recei|ved: and no wonder, con&s;idering what he had done, and was &s;till di&s;po&s;ed and able to do for them: <HI>&s;eeking the wealth of all his peo|ple, and &s;peaking peace to all his &s;eed:</HI> the peace and welfare of his people was his con|tinued concern, which he promoted by his wi&s;e coun&s;els and powerful influence with the king.</P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing upon this text, I pro|po&s;e to &s;peak to the following ob&s;ervations; which, I think, naturally ari&s;e from it in re|lation to the &s;tory.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> WHEN God is plea&s;ed to advance men of integrity and ability into the frequent <HI>pre&s;ence</HI> and <HI>favour</HI> of their &s;overeign, they have an happy advantage to &s;erve with him the intere&s;ts of their people.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> TRUE <HI>greatne&s;s</HI> may commendably be &s;ought; and when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;hould be con&s;idered, and thankfully acknowledged as the <HI>gift of God.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> THE <HI>acceptance</HI> of an obliged people is a ju&s;t &s;atisfaction to the minds of men of great u&s;efulne&s;s in exalted &s;tations.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV. Good Men</HI> advanced will hold them&s;elves obliged to improve their power and fame for the <HI>pro&s;perity</HI> of their people.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="10" REF="008452_0009_102F3211A5AB4F80"><HI>I.</HI> WHEN God is plea&s;ed to advance men of ability and integrity into the frequent pre&s;ence and favour of their &s;overeign, they have an happy advantage to &s;erve with him the intere&s;ts of their people.</P>
<P>THEIR great abilities and many faithful &s;ervices rendred to the king, engage his e|&s;teem and confidence. And hence he becomes per&s;uaded, no petitions will be preferred but &s;uch as righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall demand, or mercy reque&s;t; and &s;uch only as &s;hall promote, or at lea&s;t be con&s;i&s;tent with, the publick good. The king mu&s;t &s;ee with eyes not his own: and able, faithful men about him can hard|ly be too highly prized, as right action is univer&s;al good, errors dangerous, and wic|kedne&s;s exten&s;ive de&s;truction. Therefore &s;aid a great and politic king, <HI>him that privily &s;landereth his neighbour will I cut off; him that hath an high look and a proud heart will I not &s;uffer. Mine eyes &s;hall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect way he &s;hall &s;erve me. He that worketh deceit &s;hall not dwell within my hou&s;e; he that telleth lies &s;hall not &s;tand in my &s;ight.</HI></P>
<P>IF <HI>Aha&s;uerus</HI> had not entertained an high opinion of <HI>Haman</HI>'s ability and faithfulne&s;s, hardly would he have been able, tho' with the per&s;ua&s;ive argument of <HI>ten thou&s;and talents</HI> (which the king generou&s;ly returned) to have prevailed for the bloody murder of &s;o
<PB N="11" REF="008452_0010_102F32163735C230">
great a multitude; who had hitherto been in|dulged their peculiar cu&s;toms without detri|ment to the king's affairs; and who while they lived peaceably in the land, content with their liberty of con&s;cience, mu&s;t be a great &s;trengthening to the kingdom. E&s;pecially is <HI>fidelity,</HI> or approved <HI>loyalty,</HI> a very great re|commendation of a &s;ubject, &s;trengthening his intere&s;t with his &s;overeign to &s;erve his people. <HI>Aha&s;uerus</HI> was concern'd that <HI>Morde|cai</HI>'s loyal &s;ervices in detecting the con&s;piracy of <HI>Bigthan</HI> and <HI>Tere&s;h</HI> had never been rewar|ded. Greatne&s;s is often &s;u&s;pected, but fideli|ty creates confidence.</P>
<P>THE &s;tory of <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> and the happy ef|fects to the people of God of his intere&s;t with the king and frequent opportunities of ap|proaching into his pre&s;ence, will afford much u&s;eful in&s;truction, and quickening &s;pirit to a great man who delights to form him&s;elf by the divine le&s;&s;ons of holy &s;cripture: and of &s;uch, I hope our number is very great.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> TRUE greatne&s;s may commendably be &s;ought; and when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;hould be con|&s;idered and thankfully acknowledged as the gift of God.</P>
<P>IN this light, I conceive, I may con&s;ider the advancement of the great man in my text, and his happy condition as the reward of a national &s;pirit.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="008452_0011_102F3217DB4FA360">TRUE greatne&s;s &s;ometimes intends tho&s;e excelling accompli&s;hments which merit ho|nour; and &s;ometimes the honour which is given for them: I here con&s;ider it complexly, as comprehending both.</P>
<P>THE intrin&s;ic greatne&s;s of <HI>Mordecai,</HI> his wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice and firmne&s;s of &s;pirit, direct|ed by the fear of God to the public good of his own church and people, was the &s;olid foundation of his <HI>e&s;timated</HI> greatne&s;s, or the univer&s;al honour that was paid him, and will always be paid him, in the church of God: and upon &s;uch a foundation only can true honour ari&s;e. Let us here a little con&s;ider the difference between <HI>true</HI> and <HI>fal&s;e</HI> greatne&s;s as a compari&s;on between <HI>Mordecai</HI> and <HI>Haman</HI> may &s;hew it. Both the&s;e great men were alike high in the king's favour, both were fear'd for their power, and might alike be &s;upplicated by abject dependants, avaricious or ambitious a&s;pirers after employments they were unfit for. Their glare of glory upon they eye of the world was much the &s;ame, or <HI>Haman</HI>'s the brighter: Yet the greatne&s;s of the one was true, of the other fal&s;e: and the <HI>fear of God</HI> and a religious <HI>love of virtue</HI> made the difference. Pride, a glittering appearance, a temper never to for|give, but to revenge the &s;lighte&s;t affronts of one man with the blood of a nation, and a rapacious di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eize the prey; &s;uch was the foundation of <HI>Haman</HI>'s e&s;timated
<PB N="13" REF="008452_0012_102F321A64D0C248">
greatne&s;s. But <HI>Mordecai</HI>'s aro&s;e upon the &s;o|lid foundation of many con&s;picuous virtues peculiarly u&s;eful to the public, and a manife&s;t indifferency to the trappings of &s;tate which the childi&s;h pride of <HI>Haman</HI> dictated for him|&s;elf, as a fitting reward for the man whom the king &s;hould delight to honour.</P>
<P>THIS true greatne&s;s is what may innocent|ly and worthily be pur&s;ued: and the <HI>de&s;ire of glory</HI> is not criminal but virtuous: Chri&s;t re|commends it by his own example in that prayer, <HI>Father glorify thy Son.</HI> Fame, or a <HI>good name</HI> is &s;aid to be <HI>better than precious ointment.</HI> Ever|la&s;ting inconceivable glory is the great allure|ment of the go&s;pel to the <HI>obedience of faith.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this, like other virtuous propen&s;ities, is capable of being turned into the wor&s;t of vices. Piety, may proceed to &s;uper&s;tition, and termi|nate in hypocri&s;y; a prudent care, to anxious &s;ollicitude, and to that love of the world which is incon&s;i&s;tent with the love of God; and a ju&s;t re&s;entment of evil may degenerate into re|venge: and &s;o may the love of glory into pride, dete&s;tible in the &s;ight of God, and never en|dured by men, how much &s;oever each one hath of it in him&s;elf. Yet is there a thir&s;t af|ter <HI>true greatne&s;s,</HI> as it is virtue improved into great abilities for public u&s;efulne&s;s, which mu&s;t therefore be virtuous; and after the con|nected <HI>glory,</HI> and a joy in it with moderation
<PB N="14" REF="008452_0013_102F321CCDF60150">
when acquired, which mu&s;t be innocent, be|cau&s;e made a motive in the word of God to &s;erve the intere&s;ts of religion: <HI>they that honour God he will honour, but they that de&s;pi&s;e him &s;hall be lightly e&s;teemed.</HI></P>
<P>AND therefore it mu&s;t be con&s;i&s;tent with humility, a &s;hade nece&s;&s;ary to add the true lu&s;tre to every &s;hining public virtue; a grace of the &s;pirit of God, e&s;&s;ential to the character of a true chri&s;tian; for he that <HI>comes</HI> to Chri&s;t mu&s;t <HI>take his yoke upon him, and learn of him who was meek and lowly in heart,</HI> or <HI>he will</HI> not <HI>find re&s;t to his &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P>AND &s;o we &s;ee it was in Chri&s;t; for at the time he was fulle&s;t in his expectations of hea|venly glory, and doubtle&s;s contemplating up|on it as a &s;upport, under his approaching ago|ny and bloody &s;weat, and all the cruelties of the cro&s;s, he &s;et his di&s;ciples the mo&s;t lowly example of humility in all his life. <HI>Je&s;us, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, that he was come from God, and went to God, he aro&s;e from &s;upper and took a towel, and girded him&s;elf,</HI> to wa&s;h his di&s;ciple's feet.</P>
<P>I know, after all that can be &s;aid, proud ambitious men will be apt to flatter them&s;elves that their love of glory is the virtue: &s;o na|tural is it for men to put darkne&s;s for light when a favourite lu&s;t is in que&s;tion. It is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="15" REF="008452_0014_102F32205803B098">
however that a preacher of the go&s;pel &s;hould lend his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to enable men to di&s;tingui&s;h rightly, or at le&s;t to revive and con|tinue the well known di&s;tinction in their minds; le&s;t, as man was once for pride tur|ned out of paradi&s;e, for pride the gates of it &s;hould be &s;hut again&s;t one that would return thither.</P>
<P>I beg leave here to mention two things;</P>
<P N="1">1. Earthly glory &s;hould be always &s;ought in &s;ubordination to heavenly. This will be, according to the directions of our go&s;pel, to <HI>live by faith and not by &s;en&s;e, to &s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of God and the righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof,</HI> and ju&s;tly to prefer what is infinitely to be prefer|red. This will evidence our &s;incerity, that we believe, what we profe&s;s, that there is a future everla&s;ting world, in which all, who <HI>per&s;evere in ways of well-doing,</HI> &s;hall be rewar|ded with glory, honour and immortality. Therefore, when earthly glory is incon&s;i&s;tent with heavenly, the pur&s;uit of the former is entirely to be remitted. For what madne&s;s would it be to forego, or even hazard, the lo&s;s of heavenly glory for any thing that is earthly? for the whole world?</P>
<P>THIS is a con&s;ideration which ought always to be pre&s;ent to the mind of him, who is in the pur&s;uit of glory: for he is entred into
<PB N="16" REF="008452_0015_102F3221E61A9BB0">
temptation which nothing will carry him &s;afe|ly thro' but the faith of the go&s;pel, which is the &s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for, and the evi|dence of things not &s;een.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN like manner earthly glory is to be &s;ought with a view to future u&s;efulne&s;s. The author of our beings hath joyned &s;en&s;ible plea|&s;ure with our food; yet it is to be under the controul of the <HI>rational</HI> intention of pre&s;erving our health, and &s;trengthning the animal frame; and the <HI>religious</HI> one, of pre&s;enting our bodies living &s;acrifices holy and acceptable to the Lord, which is al&s;o, according to the apo&s;tle, a rea&s;onable &s;ervice. So the delights of world|ly glory &s;hould be but a &s;ubordinate end: and the &s;uperior &s;hould be <HI>u&s;efulne&s;s to the public.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Chri&s;t hath taught us by the before-cited prayer. <HI>Father glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee.</HI> If this were duly con&s;i|dered, great men would not by retirement de|&s;ert the &s;ervice of their country, becau&s;e they had attained to their &s;ummit of worldly glory, and their employments were become trouble&s;ome and dangerous; by which means the common-wealth is &s;ometimes deprived of it's mo&s;t u&s;eful members, when the greate&s;t abili|ties, with all the advantages of long experi|ence, are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary. If the increa&s;e of worldly honour be not &s;ufficient to di&s;&s;uade
<PB N="17" REF="008452_0016_102F322381844670">
from what is really an ignominious forfeiture of honour obtained, let it be con&s;idered what an increa&s;e of heavenly glory will be made by &s;o great &s;elf-denyal for the public good, as the continuing in a trouble&s;ome dangerous po&s;t is &s;uppo&s;ed to be.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude this general head, let me ob&s;erve, what indulgence &s;oever may be given to men to value them&s;elves upon their &s;ervices according to their true worth, and benefit to their fellow-men, and to expect me|rited honourable acknowledgments for them, there is no place for &s;uch a temper in re&s;pect of the infinite God. For, can a man be pro|fitable to God? His we are, and from him we received all our talents, and opportunities of improving them: and when we have done all in our power, and with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s in &s;erving him, we mu&s;t confe&s;s our&s;elves un|profitable &s;ervants, and that we have done but our duty. This confe&s;&s;ion becomes the mouth of the mo&s;t <HI>exalted angel</HI> about the throne of God; how much more <HI>man who is a worm,</HI> and who drinketh in iniquity like water; and in the mo&s;t glorious of who&s;e ac|tions will be found, &s;uch ignoble, impure mixtures as to be a ju&s;t occa&s;ion of penitent reflections and deep humiliation. If man hath whereof to glory, it cannot be <HI>before God.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="18" REF="008452_0017_102F322616E83E18"><HI>III.</HI> THE acceptance of an obliged people is a ju&s;t &s;atisfaction to men of great u&s;efulne&s;s in exalted &s;tations.</P>
<P>IN the minds of generous men there is a natural pa&s;&s;ion for their people, which is ex|ceeded by no other, but is &s;tronger than even the fear of death. This gives the greate&s;t con|cern when our country is in danger, pains our hearts in all it's &s;ufferings, produceth into action the wi&s;dom and re&s;olution of the great, and even creates courage in the effeminate where it never exi&s;ted before. When the people were &s;mitten and the ark taken, <HI>Eli</HI> could live no longer: And the p&s;almi&s;t thought it criminal not to prefer <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to his chief joy. This &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion, which produceth the powers of men into &s;trenuous action, pre|pares the mind to receive great &s;atisfaction from the <HI>good affections</HI> of their country.</P>
<P>AND they are what the endeavours of great men to &s;erve their country ju&s;tly de&s;erve; and the more for the greatne&s;s of their good actions which are felt in their good effects throughout the community.

<P>To be &s;ure, very painful re&s;entments do an unthankful people give to tho&s;e who have loved them, and denied them&s;elves greatly for them; enduring &s;uch di&s;quietudes and hard&s;hips as men at ea&s;e, and unu&s;ed to ima|gine them&s;elves in the places of others, (ac|cording to our &s;aviour's direction for right thinking,) have little apprehen&s;ion of; and therefore are le&s;s likely to value the benefits they have received by them.</P>

<P>THIS acceptance of public &s;ervices was, I &s;ay, one of the &s;atisfactions of <HI>Mordecai</HI>'s happy condition; and what every good man will rejoice in.

<P>THEIR councils, when demanded and gi|ven, in virtue of the high and important offices they &s;u&s;tain, will be the utmo&s;t efforts of their wi&s;dom for the good of their king and country, who&s;e intere&s;ts are in&s;eparable.

<P>FOR there is a veneration due to the laws of a country as &s;acred and inviolate, and, to which men ought to &s;ubmit, not only for wrath, but for con&s;cience &s;ake. And for this rea&s;on, it &s;eems, the formalities of them are made very &s;olemn, to awe the minds of lawle&s;s men into a fear of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing what their wickedne&s;s prompts them to tran&s;gre&s;s. And this is no more than is nece&s;&s;ary con&s;idering how great numbers in the community by liberty under|&s;tand the doing what is right in their own eyes, as when there was no king in <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> how full many are of compa&s;&s;ion, and how ready to take the part of a villainous tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or, and &s;tudious to &s;creen him when in danger of being detected, and brought to a well merited puni&s;hment; and this not only of the meaner and more &s;ordid part, but of

better men, who can have no rea&s;on to fear for them&s;elves the fate of a villain.

<P>TO mention no more, good men for the welfare of their country will be active in the execution of every wi&s;e purpo&s;e within their &s;phere of action.

Magi&s;trates do not appear to be good men, or to have the welfare of their people at heart, who behold, but connive at, the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the laws in the face of day; in&s;tead of being guardians and con&s;ervators of the foundation of their &s;ecurity and pro&s;perity, according to the in|tention of their advancement. And if &s;uch an evil prevailing be not ob&s;erved, or being ob&s;erved, is not &s;peedily remedied, well may the laws lo&s;e their ju&s;t veneration and fall into di&s;repute, by the frequent unnoticed tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of them.</P>

<P>AND let us con&s;ider, if we would be hap|py in our rulers, if we would be happy in any important re&s;pect, to our fervent prayers we mu&s;t add &s;incere repentance and and reforma|tion; dreading all hypocritical pretences to the &s;pecial favour of God when we have no|thing better to found them upon than profe&s;|&s;ion, form and ceremonies; for, for this very rea&s;on God &s;ent this threatning me&s;&s;age to I&s;rael when their judgment lingred not, and nothing would prevent it but repentance and reformation, I&s;a. 24.13, 14. <HI>Wherefore the Lord &s;aid, forasmuch, as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, the wi&s;dom of their wi&s;e &s;hall peri&s;h, and the under&s;tanding of their prudent &s;hall be hid.</HI></P>
