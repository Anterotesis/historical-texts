<P><HI>THE Author of the following work cannot &s;ay, that he undertook it in virtue of any "voted appointment," by a "convention of the Clergy"; or that he was "a&s;&s;i&s;ted" in it, either as to "method", or "management", by "directions" from &s;o learned and able a body of men. He does not pretend to have been favoured with &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing advantages. Not that his appear|ing, upon this occa&s;ion, was of his own meer mo|tion. He would rather have cho&s;en to have been excu&s;ed from engaging in an affair, that he knew would be attended with labour, and might expo&s;e him to much ill-will. But he was, at length, overcome by private friends: More e&s;pecially as urging this motive, its being publi&s;hed to the world, that, if no "objections were offer|ed again&s;t an</HI> AMERICAN EPISCOPATE, <HI>it would be taken for granted</HI> ALL PARTIES WERE SATISFIED".</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT has, for &s;ome time, been known, that the Epi&s;copal Clergy, in the Colonies, in con&s;e|quence of con&s;ultations, in convened bodies, have tran&s;mitted a number of addre&s;&s;es to England; one, to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, importunately reque&s;t|ing an AMERICAN EPISCOPATE; others, to the Arch-Bi&s;hops of Canterbury and York, to the Bi&s;hop of London, and to the Univer&s;ities of Ox|ford, and Cambridge, &s;olliciting their influence in an affair of &s;uch importance to the well-being, if not the very being, of the Church of England in the&s;e parts of the world. If this was "never in|tended to be kept a &s;ecret", it was certainly made one, at lea&s;t in regard of the arguments made u&s;e of in &s;upport of the thing reque&s;ted; for though an authentic knowledge of them was de&s;ired, it could not be obtained at fir&s;t, and I know not that it ever has been &s;ince. The affair &s;eems to have been carried on, as it were, under ground, until "the di&s;covery of a favorable di&s;po&s;ition in ma|ny," at home, towards the &s;upport of the thing in view. And now, the way being prepared, it is "thought proper, in a public manner, to give information of the REASONS, why an American-Epi&s;copate is &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired by the Clergy, and other friends and members of the church". It might have been as proper, and certainly would have been more candid and generous, not to &s;ay fair, if they had given the&s;e rea&s;ons, when they &s;ent their addre&s;&s;es &s;upported by them. We might then have been heard at home as well, and
<PB N="6" REF="010853_0005_0F8522BB6C507F68">
as &s;oon, as they; and judgment might have been made upon an impartial hearing of the ca&s;e, and not by hearing one &s;ide only. We are, after &s;uch previous care to ripen matters at home in their favor, without all controver&s;ie, under di&s;advantage in offering what we have to &s;ay upon this affair, which may far more nearly concern the civil as well as religious intere&s;ts of the Continent, than &s;ome may be ready, at fir&s;t view, to imagine.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t not be e&s;teemed &s;trange, if "&s;ome per&s;ons", I may rather &s;ay many, are "alarmed at this conduct of the clergy". For now "the ca&s;e has been explained", and is well "under|&s;tood", there &s;till "remains unea&s;ine&s;s"; nor is the exhibited PLAN "&s;o rea&s;onable", even in regard of the Epi&s;copal churches; or &s;o "harmle&s;s to other denominations", as the Dr. would repre|&s;ent. He hopes, "every objection", or even "&s;u&s;|picion", will be "intirely obviated" by what he has to &s;ay. But "&s;hould any objections continue, which &s;hall be thought worthy of notice, objectors are invited to propo&s;e them in &s;uch a manner, that they may be fairly and candidly debated before the tribunal of the public". It is in compliance with this invitation, that the following &s;heets are wrote; as al&s;o, that it might not be "taken for granted, that all parties acquie&s;ce and are &s;atisfied". We join with the Epi&s;copalians in bringing the ca&s;e to open tryal. We de&s;ire nothing more than an impartial hearing. Let the public judge between us.</P>
<P>I SHALL proceed in the method the Dr. has chalked out; taking into con&s;ideration his &s;everal &s;ections one by one, and &s;aying what may be thought proper, in a way of an&s;wer, to each of them di&s;tinctly.</P>

<P>THE Dr. begins the &s;ubject before him with premi&s;ing, "that the Church of England is Epi&s;copal; and con&s;equently holds the nece&s;&s;ity of Bi&s;hops to govern the Church, and to confer eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers". If he means, that the con&s;titution of the Church of England, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, is Epi&s;copal, making Bi&s;hops, under the King, and within certain pre&s;cribed li|mits, the governors of the Church, and conveyers of eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers, and that this is the doctrine of the Church, it is readily acknowledged: But, if he intended to lead us into this thought, that the Church of England holds, or is obliged to hold, the DIVINE RIGHT of Bi&s;hops to govern the Church, or confer eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers, in virtue of their being officers di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters; we differ from him in opinion.

EDWARD the &s;ixth no &s;ooner came to the throne, than he took proper methods to go on with the reformation, begun in the former reign. Among other mea&s;ures, he called an a&s;&s;embly of &s;elect Di|vines, the mo&s;t re&s;pectable for &s;tation, piety and learning in that day, and propo&s;ed to them &s;everal que&s;tions, relative to the &s;ettlement of religion ac|cording to God's word; to which que&s;tions they gave in &s;everally their re&s;olutions in papers, all who&s;e judgments were accurately &s;ummed up, and &s;et down by the Arch-Bi&s;hop of Canterbury him|&s;elf. In an&s;wer to the 10th que&s;tion, "whether Bi&s;hops or Prie&s;ts were fir&s;t", Arch-Bi&s;hop Cran|mer's opinion, given in writing under his own hand, was this, "Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts were at one time, and were not two things, but one office in the beginning of Chri&s;t's religion".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Irenicum pag. 392.</NOTE> The Bi&s;hop of A&s;aph, Dr. Therleby, Dr. Redmayn, and Cox, were all of the &s;ame opinion with the Arch-Bi&s;hop; and the two latter expre&s;ly cited the opinion of Jerom with approbation.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. pag. 393.</NOTE> In this &s;ame reign, in a public declaration, &s;ub&s;cribed by the Arch-Bi&s;h|ops of Canterbury and York, eleven Bi&s;hops, and many other Doctors and Civilians, it is expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erted, "that, in the new-te&s;tament, no mention is made of any degrees, or di&s;tinction of orders, but only of Deacons or mini&s;ters, and of Prie&s;ts or Bi&s;hops".<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Burnet's hi&s;t. of the reformation, and Neal's hi&s;t. of Puritani&s;m.</NOTE> It is indeed beyond all rea&s;onable di&s;pute, that the Epi&s;copal form of government was &s;ettled, at the reformation, as Dr. Stillingfleet expre&s;&s;es it,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Iren. pag. 385.</NOTE> "not under pretence of DIVINE RIGHT, but for the conveniency of that form to the &s;tate and condition of the Church at the time

James, his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf declared it in print, as his judgment, "that the civil power, in any na|tion, hath the right of pre&s;cribing what external form of Church-government it plea&s;es, which doth mo&s;t agree to the civil form of government in the &s;tate".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>So far from the beginning of the reformation as 1722, the lower hou&s;e of convocation addre&s;&s;ed the upper, &s;ignifying their trouble to find them&s;elves a&s;per&s;ed, as ill affected to the Metropolitical and Epi&s;copal rights, begging their Lord&s;hips would not give credit to any &s;uch evil &s;ugge&s;tions, as al&s;o that the <HI>declaration</HI> they had made and &s;igned might be entered on their books. The import of this declaration was, "that whereas they had been &s;candalou&s;ly repre&s;ented as favorers of Pre&s;bytery, in oppo&s;ition to Epi&s;copacy, they now de|clared, that they acknowledged the ORDER of Bi&s;hops, as SUPERIOR to Pre&s;byters, to be of DIVINE APOSTO|LICAL INSTITUTION".&mdash;</P>
<P>The &s;ame day they pre&s;ented an additional addre&s;s, &s;ig|nifying, that whereas this their declaration had given NEW OFFENCE, and that from having been traduced for allowing TOO LITTLE to Epi&s;copacy, they were now accu&s;ed of ASCRIBING TOO MUCH to it, they begged therefore that their Lord&s;hips would take the doctrine afore&s;aid into their mature con&s;ideration.&mdash;Calamy's abridgment, pag. 667, 668.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>THE plain truth is, this notion of the right of Bi&s;hops to govern and ordain, as being officers in the Church, &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters by DIVINE APPOINTMENT, was, as the excellent Mr&punc; J. Owen &s;ays, "fir&s;t promoted in the Church of England by Arch-Bi&s;hop Laud. Dr. Holland, the King's profe&s;&s;or in Oxon, was much offended with him for a&s;&s;erting it in a di&s;putation for his degrees. He checked him publicly, and told him he went

<P>IT may have been the practice of the Church of England, for &s;ome time, as the Dr. ob&s;erves, "to admit none to officiate as Clergymen, who have not been ordained by Bi&s;hops". But it was not always &s;o. The point of re-ordination did not begin to be urged, until the days of Arch-Bi&s;hop Laud. Through his influence, as Mr. Prin tells us,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Owen's plea for &s;crip. ordination, pag. 117.</NOTE> Bi&s;hop Hall re-ordained Mr. John Dury, a mini|&s;ter of the reformed Church. But the old Church of England did not require, or practi&s;e re-ordina|tion. In King Edward the &s;ixth's time, Peter Martyr, Martin Bucer, and P. Fagius, had eccle|&s;ia&s;tical preferments in the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church with|out it.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 118.</NOTE> Mr. William Whitingham was made Dean of Durham, about 1563; though ordained by Pre&s;byters only.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 121.</NOTE> In like manner, Mr. Tra|vers, ordained by a Pre&s;byter beyond &s;ea, was &s;e|ven years Lecturer at the Temple, and had the Bi|&s;hop of London's letter for it.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 122.</NOTE> And, even in the reign of King James the fir&s;t, the validity of ordi|nation by Pre&s;byters was not &s;et a&s;ide; as appears from the ca&s;e of the three Pre&s;byters that were con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hops for Scotland, at London.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">See the ca&s;e related at large in Pierce's Vind. of Di&s;&s;ent. pag. 167. He likewi&s;e here tells us, when the Arch-Bi&s;hop of Spalato was in England, he de&s;ired Bi&s;hop Morton to re-ordain a per&s;on ordained beyond &s;ea, that he might be more capable of preferment.

THE Dr. having premi&s;ed, that the Church of England holds the nece&s;&s;ity of Bi&s;hops to govern the Church, and confer orders, &s;ays. "it is not nece&s;&s;ary to enter upon a particular defence of this doctrine, &s;ince the plea", in the pre&s;ent undertak|ing, "is equally valid, whether the&s;e principles are founded rightly or wrongly". Why then did he put him&s;elf to the trouble of exhibiting "a &s;ketch of the arguments, whereby the nece&s;&s;ity of Epi&s;copal government is defended"? I know of no valuable end this was adapted to an&s;wer. It may have increa&s;ed the number of his pages; but, at the &s;ame time, it has detained his readers from attending to the main bu&s;ine&s;s in hand, and need|le&s;ly too, as I imagine; &s;ince he has given us only a detail of arguments that have been repeated over and over again, and as repeatedly been an|&s;wered. However, he has made it proper, if not nece&s;&s;ary, to po&s;tpone the con&s;ideration of the grand point in view, until I al&s;o have given "a &s;ketch of the arguments" that have been u&s;ed on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>HE &s;ays, "it is an e&s;&s;ential doctrine of the Church of England, that none have any authority in the chri&s;tian Church, but tho&s;e who derive it from Chri&s;t, either <HI>mediately</HI> or <HI>immediately".</HI> This is not a doctrine peculiar to the Engli&s;h Church. Every other chri&s;tian Church, of whatever deno|mination, holds the &s;ame. The Churches, in the Colonies, are certainly of this opinion. But we differ from the Dr. when he &s;ays, "that this au|thority mu&s;t be derived, if <HI>mediately,</HI> by a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion", meaning hereby an uninterrupted one, in a line of Bi&s;hops, as an order &s;uperior to Pre&s;by|ters, even from the Apo&s;tles&punc; Nor can we be
<PB N="15" REF="010853_0014_0F8522C227908270">
brought to think, that the uninterruption of this line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is SO NECESSARY, that, "if it be ONCE broken, and the power of ordination [that is, the power in this way communicated] lo&s;t, not all the men on earth, not all the angels of heaven, without an immediate commi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t, can re&s;tore it". Is this the doctrine of the Church of England? I am bold to &s;ay, no &s;uch thing can be found in the thirty-nine articles, or in the homilies, or in the form of ordination, or in the common-prayer-book, or in any part of the Church's &s;y&s;tem in regard of the Clergy: Nor is it ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;eable, that one in an hundred, even of tho&s;e who are thorow Epi&s;copalians, make this the object of their faith. It is indeed &s;carce cre|dible, that any who have read the &s;criptures, which every where &s;o expre&s;ly &s;ecure the great ble&s;&s;ings purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t to all that believe in him, re|pent, &amp; &s;incerely obey him, &s;hould imagine notwith|&s;tanding, that all who have a right to the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings mu&s;t be al&s;o members of a particular Church, over which an officer &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters pre&s;ides, and in an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from the Apo|&s;tles; e&s;pecially, when this pretended regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is &s;o far from being inconte&s;table, that it is not capable of good proof, nor is there any probability, that &s;o long a chain, running through &s;o many ages of ignorance, violence, and all kinds of impo&s;ture, has never once been broken.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader may &s;ee this matter &s;et in its proper light by Bi&s;hop Stillingfleet, in his Irenicum; by Profe&s;&s;or Jame&s;on, in his fundamentals of the Heirarchy exa|mined; and, above all, by Mr. Thomas Walter, one of the fir&s;t gentlemen for genius and learning this Country has produced, in his an&s;wer to a piece pub|li&s;hed here in defence of Epi&s;copacy, upon the plan of an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.

Mr. Petoy the Hi&s;torian &s;ays, that the Church of England, as well as the Scotch Church, was at fir&s;t planted and governed without Bi&s;hops, until Bi&s;hops were &s;ent them from Rome.

He was made Bi&s;hop of Canterbury, &s;ays Hoffman, about the year of Chri&s;t, 596. It will, perhaps, be found difficult to make out the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from him.

that your own orders, if &s;trictly examined, may mini&s;ter great doubt &amp; di&s;quietude of mind</Q>&mdash;I &s;hall only &s;ay farther, upon this article of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, &s;uppo&s;ing it was true, which is by no means allowed, that "objectors could not prove it has been interrupted", this is far from being &s;ufficient, in a matter of &s;uch ESSENTIAL impor|tance, as the Dr. makes the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to be. Was I in his way of thinking, I &s;hould not, I freely own, dare officiate as an officer in the kingdom of Chri&s;t, unle&s;s I was able to &s;atisfie my&s;elf, upon po&s;itive evidence, clear and indubitable, that the Bi&s;hop, from whom I had received orders, derived his power to confer them on me in an uninter|rupted line from the Apo&s;tles: Nor &s;hould I be|lieve, that the people of my charge acted a wi&s;e and &s;afe part, unle&s;s they al&s;o, upon like evidence, were fully convinced, that I had, in this way, re|ceived my commi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t. It is my firm per&s;ua&s;ion, the Dr. would never again preach to his people, or they be willing to hear him, if his preaching, and their hearing, was to be con&s;equent upon the proof he could give, that the Bi&s;hop, who ordained him, had in a direct line &s;ucceeded &s;ome one of the Apo&s;tles. I cannot therefore but e|&s;teem it highly ra&s;h and extravagant in him to &s;ay, that, if the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion could be proved to have been broken, "Chri&s;t has neglected to provide for his Church in a ca&s;e e&s;&s;ential to the very being of it".</P>
<P>WE again agree with the Dr. when he &s;ays, <Q>that the Apo&s;tles under&s;tood the laws of Chri&s;t&mdash;that they were conducted by the Spirit of God&mdash;that they have given explicit and particular rules for the government of the Church&mdash;that the
<PB N="20" REF="010853_0019_0F8522C5E7296400">
public practice of the Apo&s;tles is a faithful and plain comment on the laws of Chri&s;t, and of equal authority with any written in&s;tructions&mdash;that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour committed the govern|ment of his Church to them&mdash;that this govern|ment was exerci&s;ed by them&mdash;and that they con|veyed it to others, to be communicated to others &s;till to the late&s;t po&s;terity</Q>. Thus far we are perfectly agreed; but we mu&s;t now part again. We cannot &s;ay with the Dr. "that the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ors were an order di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, tho&s;e who are now called Pre&s;byters; and that none who were not of this highe&s;t order had the power of ordination &amp; government committed to them". He has not &s;een fit to give us here the evidence upon which this point may be e&s;tabli&s;hed, lea&s;t it &s;hould "lead him too far from his pre&s;ent de|&s;ign". It might therefore be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, it cannot rea&s;onably be expected we &s;hould be bro't to be of his mind, until we have &s;een this proof, and are convinced by it. However, I &s;hall not think it a going out of my way, ju&s;t to remark one thing, which is unaccountably &s;trange, if Bi|&s;hops are, by apo&s;tolic appointment, an order of officers in the Church di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, Pre&s;byters. It is this. The Apo&s;tles have not any where given in&s;tructions, de&s;criptive of the per&s;ons fit for the work of the mini&s;try, that are at all adapted to the &s;uppo&s;ition of a DIFFERENCE OF ORDER in the pa&s;toral office. Had there been &s;uch a difference, different qualifications would have been requi&s;ite to the &s;utable di&s;charge of the different tru&s;ts ari&s;ing therefrom; and it might ju&s;tly have been expected, that they would have di&s;tingui&s;hed between the qualifications re&s;pective|ly proper for the management of each of the&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="010853_0020_0F8522C6A0FB7F28">
tru&s;ts. But they no where thus di&s;tingui&s;h. They no where intimate, that &s;uch different endowments were nece&s;&s;ary. Far from this, they have &s;pecified the qualifications of ONE ORDER of pa&s;tors only; as may be &s;een at large in the Epi&s;tles to Timothy and Titus. And, what may be worthy of &s;pecial notice, they have been very particular in de&s;crib|ing the qualifications of this ONE ORDER, while they are totally &s;ilent with re&s;pect to the other that is pleaded for, though that other is &s;aid to be by much the mo&s;t honorable and important of the two. In like manner, they have no where laid down any rules for the guidance of ordainers in ve&s;ting ordinary mini&s;ters with different degrees of power. They no where &s;peak of the in&s;titution of two di&s;tinct orders of &s;tanding pa&s;tors; they no where give in&s;tructions to exerci&s;e the or|daining right conformably to this di&s;tinction, by placing &s;ome in an higher, others in a lower rank in the Church. The &s;acred writings of the Apo|&s;tles &s;ay nothing to &s;uch a purpo&s;e as this: On the contrary, they pre&s;ent to our view a very full and explicit directory for the ordination of ONE ORDER ONLY of fixed pa&s;tors. This we have in the Pauline in&s;tructions, referring to the &s;ettle|ment of the Churches in Crete. The great Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles gives it in charge to Titus, whom he left in this I&s;land with a direct view to "&s;et in order the things that were wanting", to or|dain pa&s;tors in the &s;everal Churches there. But what pa&s;tors were they? Of a different rank, &s;ome &s;uperior, others inferior? Not a word leading to &s;uch a thought is to be found throughout his whole Epi&s;tle. No; but the pa&s;tors he directs &s;hould be ordained were preci&s;ely of the &s;ame rank or de|gree: Nor did Titus ordain any other. He could
<PB N="22" REF="010853_0021_0F8522C766B03C60">
not indeed have done it, unle&s;s he had acted coun|ter to the direction he had received from the in|&s;pired Paul. Should it be &s;aid here, Titus was him&s;elf, at this time, the &s;ole Bi&s;hop of Crete, and as &s;uch intru&s;ted with the &s;ole power of ordaining inferior pa&s;tors; the an&s;wer is, this cannot be &s;up|ported upon ju&s;t and &s;olid grounds. It is a meer pretence, as we have often had occa&s;ion to make very clearly evident.</P>
<P>THE Dr. now proceeds to con&s;ider the evidence, in favor of Epi&s;copacy, in his &s;en&s;e of it, "from the general &s;tate of the primitive Church". If, when he &s;ays, <Q>it is a known fact, that all the Churches that were gathered, during the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Century, by the Apo&s;tles, or their Mi&s;&s;ionaries, were under the direction of &s;ome one or other of that venerable order; that men of the mo&s;t e|minent piety, who had been honored with their acquaintance, were appointed by them to &s;uper|intend Churches in certain di&s;tricts, &s;ome of whom were cho&s;en to &s;ucceed them in tho&s;e Churches which they had always kept under their own immediate in&s;pection;</Q> I &s;ay, if by this fact he means, that the per&s;ons appointed by the Apo&s;tles in their day, or cho&s;en afterwards, <HI>within this Century,</HI> to &s;ucceed them in &s;uper|intending the Churches, were officers of a &s;uperior order to tho&s;e, who are called, in the New-te&s;ta|ment, &s;ometimes Bi&s;hops, &s;ometimes Pre&s;byters, meaning by the&s;e names one and the &s;ame order of men, he &s;hould have given better proof of it, than a bare declaration, that "nothing but gro&s;s prejudice, or a wrangling and captious di&s;po&s;ition, to &s;ay nothing wor&s;e, could lead any to &s;u&s;pect or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">" the contrary. He is much mi&s;taken, if he,
<PB N="23" REF="010853_0022_0F8522C8A98A4ED0">
imagines, that prejudice, or wrangling captiou&s;ne&s;s, or any thing wor&s;e, is confined to Pre&s;byterians. The &s;ticklers for Prelacy are as much, not to &s;ay a great deal more, under the influence of the&s;e fatal hindrances to the reception of "the truth in the love of it". All he has &s;aid here in favor of Epi&s;copacy, in the &s;en&s;e he under&s;tands it, re&s;ts &s;olely upon his meer affirmation.</P>
<P>HE goes on, "if we con&s;ider the general cha|racter of Chri&s;tians, and the &s;tate of the Church, in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> and <HI>third</HI> Centuries, we &s;hall not find it ea&s;ie to believe, that there could have been any e&s;&s;ential departure from the original plan of di&s;ci|pline and government committed to the Church". There certainly was not. The &s;tate of things was not much varied from this plan, within the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Century. Bi&s;hops were not as yet known, as an order in the Church di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, Pre&s;byters. The promi&s;cuous u&s;e of the terms Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter was &s;till in u&s;e; nor is that mode of diction, BISHOPS, PRESBYTERS AND DEACONS, to be met with in any writer before Clement of Alexandria, who did not flouri&s;h until the latter end of this <HI>&s;econd</HI> Century, unle&s;s we ex|cept Ignatius,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Dr. in a marginal note; pag. 8, 9. is plea&s;ed to offer a few words in favor of the <HI>Ignatian Epi&s;tles,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to Dr. Chauncy's DUDLEIAN Lecture at the College in Cambridge; in which he endeavoured to invalidate their te&s;timony. Says Dr. Chandler, "he undoubtedly knows that he has been able to offer no|thing <HI>new</HI> on &s;o exhau&s;ted a &s;ubject". He did not aim at this; though he may have added &s;ome <HI>new</HI> thoughts, at lea&s;t the old ones are placed in a <HI>new</HI> light. It fol|lows, "and others know, that he has &s;aid nothing a|gain&s;t the authenticity of the&s;e Epi&s;tles, but what has, long ago, been fairly and fully confuted". This is an ea&s;ie way to an&s;wer any thing. He would have done him&s;elf much more honor, as a man of learning, if, in a way of &s;olid argument, he had him&s;elf taken off the force of what had been objected again&s;t the authenticity of the&s;e Epi&s;tles. The author of the DUDLEIAN di&s;|cour&s;e thought it below him to reject the <HI>Ignatian E|pi&s;tles</HI> as corrupt, and not to be depended on, becau&s;e great and learned men knew this to be the real truth; but he was at the pains, in a cour&s;e of ju&s;t rea&s;oning, to evince it to be &s;o. Meer affirmations, in controverted points, however &s;anguinely delivered, are meer no|things, and accounted &s;o by all capable judges.</P>
<P>He &s;ays farther, "although the advocates for Epi&s;copacy &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity for giving up the te&s;timony of Ignatius, it is not from an opinion that their cau&s;e would labor under any great di&s;tre&s;s without that &s;upport". We are not very &s;trongly inclined to give full credit to what is here delivered. Ignatius is the only writer, until towards the clo&s;e of the &s;econd Century, that is of any &s;ervice to the Epi&s;copal cau&s;e. Prelatical writers know it, and accordingly repair to his Epi&s;tles as their Sheet-anchor; and they did &s;o, with as much zeal and a&s;&s;u|rance as they do now, when they had no copies of the&s;e Epi&s;tles, but &s;uch as, at this day, are acknowledged by Epi&s;copalians them&s;elves to have been &s;o corrupted and interpolated, as not to be capable of a ju&s;t vindication. If they had thought their cau&s;e "would not have la|bored under di&s;tre&s;s" without the&s;e Epi&s;tles, they would not have been at &s;uch immen&s;e pains to purge them, and &s;upport their authority for their proper u&s;e.</P>
<P>The Dr. exclaims, <Q>hard is the fate of ancient writers! For, if they do not countenance modern opinions, the authority of their writings will be di&s;puted. And when an ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition is once undertaken, whether from intere&s;t, or &s;pleen and malignity, no ancient authors are &s;o &s;ecure, not even tho&s;e of &s;ome of the holy Bible, but that &s;uch adventurers may be able to do &s;ome injury to their reputation and autho|rity.</Q> Had not the Dr. been him&s;elf mo&s;t evidently under the prevailing influence of Intere&s;t, or Malignity, or both, or &s;omething wor&s;e, when he wrote this, it would not have had a place here. He knows, or might have known, if he had read even Epi&s;copal writers, and the&s;e only, that KNAVISH FORGERIES were common, even in tho&s;e times that are called primitive. Scarce one of the Apo&s;tles, or fir&s;t Chri&s;tian fathers, have e|&s;caped being per&s;onated by &s;ome wretched impo&s;tor, in &s;ome work or other &s;ent into the world under their name. Even Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf has been thus ba&s;ely u&s;ed. One mu&s;t be quite unacquainted with the ancient writings not to know this. Nay, it is the truth of fact, and acknowledged to be &s;o, not only by Epi&s;copalians, but even Roman-Catholic-Writers, that IGNATIUS in particular has been mo&s;t fraudulently dealt with, no le&s;s than EIGHT of the fifteen Epi&s;tles that bear his name being FORGERIES; yea, it is fact likewi&s;e, and owned to be &s;o, that the OTHER SEVEN, before the editions of U&s;her and Vo&s;&s;ius, had been &s;o CORRUPTED by &s;ome knavi&s;h interpolator, that they ought not to be received as his genuine works. Their great advocate and defender, Bi&s;hop Pear&s;on, expre&s;ly declines the vindication of them, in their old editions, notwith&s;tanding the care and pains of Vedelius to purge them. Had the Dr. attended to the&s;e indubitable facts, he would not have made the above bitter complaint; much le&s;s would he have in&s;erted his narrative from Father <HI>Hardouin,</HI> which is as much to the purpo&s;e, as if he had told the &s;tory of a cock, and a bull, and three ram-chickens, with which the children are &s;ometimes diverted.</P></NOTE>in who&s;e corrupted and interpo|lated

Until they do this, which we know it is not in their power to do, we &s;hall continue of the mind, that no more can be collected from the fathers, within this period, than from the &s;crip|tures them&s;elves, to give countenance to Epi&s;copa|cy, in the view in which we oppo&s;e it.</P>

It is indubitably clear, that the Church was governed, AS YET, by Pre&s;byters as well as Bi&s;hops: Nor does it appear, that a Bi&s;hop was NOW any thing more than the head of a SINGLE flock or congregation, the affairs of which were managed, not by the Bi&s;hop ALONE, as though all power was ve&s;ted in him; but by its Pre&s;byters al&s;o, united in one common council. This is plainly vi&s;ible thro' the whole of Cyprian's writings. Nay, that wonder of learning, Profe&s;&s;or Jame&s;on, is very po&s;itive in it, that, in the opinion of Cyprian him&s;elf, Bi&s;hops were no otherwi&s;e &s;u|perior to Pre&s;byters, than Peter was to the other Apo&s;tles, the FIRST, the HEAD, of one and the &s;ame order in the Church.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Cyprianus Isotimus, chap. 4th, throughout.</NOTE> But, whatever the di|&s;tinction was, that might take place, in time, between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, it was undoubtedly &s;mall in its beginnings. The Bi&s;hop was, at fir&s;t, only PRIMUS INTER PARES, the Head-Pre&s;byter, the prae&s;es of the con&s;i&s;tory; and it was gradually and imperceptibly that he attained to that dignity and power, with which he was afterwards ve&s;ted. It did not come into event at once. It was the work of time, and a long time too. From Prime-Pre&s;byters aro&s;e Bi&s;hops; from City-Bi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops who&s;e power extended to the neighbour|ing Country-Churches; and, when chri&s;tianity had got the &s;ecular arm on its &s;ide, and corruption had increa&s;ed therewith, as it ha&s;tily did to a mon|&s;trous height, we now hear of Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops; from the&s;e aro&s;e Metropolitans; from Metropoli|tans, Patriarchs; and finally, at the top of all, his

holine&s;s, the POPE, claiming the character of uni|ver&s;al Head of the Church. This &s;tate of things came on in&s;en&s;ibly, &s;tep by &s;tep, and not all at once. It began, in a degree, even in the Apo&s;tles days, di&s;covering it&s;elf in the pride of Diotrephes, who "de&s;ired the preheminence"; and it went on increa&s;ing, until the ri&s;e of that amazing power, which for &s;o many Centuries, has oppre&s;&s;ed, and de&s;troyed, the &s;aints of the mo&s;t high God.</P>
<P>THIS will rea&s;onably and fully account for "a departure from the original plan of government", without its making at fir&s;t, or in its gradual ad|vances for a while, "any violent &s;truggles and convul&s;ions". According to the prophetic decla|ration of the Apo&s;tle Paul, it was to come on MYSTERIOUSLY; and &s;o it did in fact, and in&s;en|&s;ibly too, until the powers of this world could be called in to the aid of a&s;piring gra&s;ping Clergy|men; and then there was bu&s;tle, &s;truggling, and noi&s;e enough: For, from this time, we read of little el&s;e, in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, but the &s;quabbles of &s;ome of the Clergy, and their artful, and &s;ome|times perfidious, managements to enrich and ag|grandize them&s;elves, to the depre&s;&s;ion of others; until, at length, he that is called THE SON OF PERDITION became the MAN OF SIN grown up to his fullne&s;s of &s;tature.</P>

And there may be the more rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect this, as, after his conver&s;ion from Popery, it appears, from a letter of his to Dr. Sheldon, "that he had &s;cruples about leaving the Church of Rome, and returning to the Church of England"; which &s;cruples he freely declared to his friends.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bayle's Critic.

<HEAD>ANSWER to SECTION II. which &s;ays, "The Powers peculiar to the Epi&s;copal Office are Government, Ordination, and Confirmation".</HEAD>
<P>THE Dr's bu&s;ine&s;s here is to explain, and e&s;ta|bli&s;h, the proper &s;uperiority of Bi&s;hops to Pre&s;byters. In order to this, he previou&s;ly endea|vours to &s;eparate, what he calls, the APPENDAGES to the Epi&s;copal office, from the powers that e&s;&s;en|tially belong to it. And here he &s;ays, "every one knows, that the office of a Clergyman is the &s;ame, whether he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Fortune, or is without one; whether he has a large Pari&s;h, or a &s;mall one". And &s;o "with regard to place, he who has a &s;mall Dioce&s;s has the &s;ame Epi&s;copal power, as he who has a large one; and it matters not, as to the validity of the act, whether it be performed by the Bi&s;hop of Man, or the Arch-Bi&s;hop of Canter|bury". The que&s;tion is not, whether the&s;e and &s;uch like APPENDAGES to the Epi&s;copal-office will be de&s;tructive of the powers, which, by the in&s;ti|tution of Chri&s;t, e&s;&s;entially belong to it; but whe|ther they do not unfit the per&s;ons ve&s;ted with it for the proper di&s;charge of the duties of it? In|&s;omuch, that it would be highly unrea&s;onable to add &s;uch Appendages to the office, and as much &s;o to expect, if they are added, that chri&s;tian pro|fe&s;&s;ors &s;hould not complain of it as an intolerable
<PB N="34" REF="010853_0033_0F8522D5513837E8">
grievance. If it "matters not, as to the validity of the act", whether a Bi&s;hop has a &s;ingle congre|gation for his charge, or &s;everal hundred, it cer|tainly does as to his capacity to &s;erve the great ends of his office. I &s;uppo&s;e the Dr. would not &s;ay, it would de&s;troy the "validity" of a Bi&s;hop's act, was he an univer&s;al one, as the POPE is; but there are few, I believe, but would think it "mattered much", whether there was &s;uch a Bi&s;hop, or not. And the clothing Bi&s;hops with worldly dignity and power, and placing them at the head of large Di|oce&s;&s;es, is, in proportion, the &s;ame incongruity; and, in&s;tead of &s;erving the true &s;piritual intere&s;t of the Church of Chri&s;t, has been greatly detrimental to it in all ages, from Con&s;tantine to this day; and, I am per&s;uaded, will ever be &s;o.</P>
<P>THE Dr. now comes to the con&s;ideration of "tho&s;e powers that are peculiar to Bi&s;hops, and without which they would cea&s;e to be Bi&s;hops"; and the&s;e, he &s;ays, "will be found to be the powers of <HI>government, ordination,</HI> and <HI>confirmation</HI>".</P>
<P>HE begins with the "power or right of govern|ment", in &s;upport of which he has offered three things.</P>
<P>ONE is, that "this right is nece&s;&s;arily included in the &s;uperiority of their office". He does not here, as might have been expected, in &s;o impor|tant a matter, go into the con&s;ideration of the na|ture of this office, proving herefrom its &s;uperiority, in the &s;en&s;e he affixes to this word. By the go|verning power he would make e&s;&s;ential to the Epi&s;copal office, he means a monarchical power, &s;uch an one as may be exerci&s;ed without &s;ubordi|nate
<PB N="35" REF="010853_0034_0F8522D60D5D2C50">
officers, yea, in oppo&s;ition to them. But, &s;urely, &s;uch a power as this is not "nece&s;&s;arily in|cluded" in meer &s;uperiority of office. This &s;u|periority there may be, and this there has been, and now is, in many &s;ocieties, where the power of the highe&s;t office, among &s;ubordinate ones, is not the power of an ab&s;olute Monarch, which knows no check but his own &s;overeign plea&s;ure. No|thing therefore is yet &s;aid, that has the appearance of &s;olid argument.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing is, "that this power was con|veyed from the Apo&s;tles to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the Bi&s;hops; that it was exerci&s;ed by Timothy, Titus, and others; and that it has, through all ages of the Church, been tran&s;mitted down, and maintain|ed by the Epi&s;copal order". So the Dr. &s;ays, with|out adding one word by way of proof. It is very extraordinary, when he undertook to &s;upport the &s;uperiority of Bi&s;hops in point of government, and as ab&s;olute Monarchs too, that he &s;hould do it in a dictatorial manner only; as though his affirma|tion would be e&s;teemed good evidence in the ca&s;e. We mu&s;t have a much better argument to con|vince us, that the exorbitant power he claims for Bi&s;hops really belongs to them, than barely his &s;aying, that it was "conveyed to them by the Apo&s;tles, and has been exerci&s;ed by them ever &s;ince".</P>
<P>THE la&s;t thing is, the Epi&s;tles to the &s;even Churches of the Lydian-A&s;ia; which, &s;ays he, "are a proof, that the government of the Chur|ches, re&s;pectively, was lodged in the hands of &s;in|gle per&s;ons, who are called Argels, by which was meant and intended, according to the voice
<PB N="36" REF="010853_0035_0F8522D66B801FA8">
of united antiquity, Bi&s;hops in the appropriated &s;en&s;e". Here again he re&s;ts this e&s;&s;ential affair of the government of Bi&s;hops upon meer affirmation; though he could not but know, that it has been proved, at lea&s;t in the opinion of Non-Epi&s;copali|ans, an hundred times, that the&s;e "Argels" were not Bi&s;hops, "in his appropriated &s;en&s;e". This is all, however &s;trange it may appear to the reader, that the Dr. has been plea&s;ed to &s;ay in defence of that &s;uper-intending, ab&s;olutely monarchical power he e&s;&s;entially connects with the Epi&s;copal office. If nothing more can be offered in proof of this claim, it is, without all doubt, an unju&s;tifiable one; and we may ju&s;tly look upon &s;uch power, where-ever exerci&s;ed, as a real u&s;urpation; e&s;pecially, if the two following pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, among many others that might be mentioned, are attend|ed to. The fir&s;t is in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, chap. 20. 17. "And from Miletus, he [Paul] &s;ent to Ephe&s;us, and called the Elders [Pre&s;buterous, the Pre&s;byter&s;] of the Church". It follows, ver. 28. "Take heed to your &s;elves, and to all the flock, over which the holy Gho&s;t hath made you over|&s;eers [Epi&s;copous, Bi&s;hops] to feed [Poimainein] the Church of God". Two things are here ob|viou&s;ly di&s;cernable. One is, that, in the opinion of the apo&s;tle Paul, Pre&s;byters and Bi&s;hops are one and the &s;ame officers in the Church; for he pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly makes u&s;e of the&s;e names, in the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;e, to point out preci&s;ely the &s;ame per&s;ons. The other is, that the work proper to Pre&s;byters is that of "feeding the flock of God"; an allu|&s;ion to the bu&s;ine&s;s of Shepherds, which e&s;&s;entially includes in it the in&s;pection and government of the Sheep committed to their care. "To feed", [Poimainein] is often u&s;ed to &s;ignifie the whole
<PB N="37" REF="010853_0036_0F8522D741873470">
duty of the Governor of a family, and of tho&s;e Governors al&s;o who are at the head of Kingdoms. In Revel. 2. 27. it is &s;aid of Chri&s;t, in his character as "Lord of all", that Poimanei autous, "he &s;hall rule them [the nations] with a rod of Iron". The other text of &s;acred writ is that in Peter's fir&s;t Epi&s;tle, 5th chap, fir&s;t and &s;econd ver&s;es, "The Elders [Pre&s;buterous] which are among you I ex|hort, who am al&s;o an Elder;&mdash;feed [Poimanate] the Church of God, which is among you, taking the over&s;ight thereof", Epi&s;copountes, acting the part of Bi&s;hops towards them. It is plain, from this pa&s;&s;age, that the work of in&s;tructing and go|verning the Church of God properly belongs to Pre&s;byters: Nor could it well have been more plainly and fully expre&s;&s;ed; for they are not only exhorted, by an in&s;pired Pen, to "feed the Church of God"; but to do it, Epi&s;copountes, acting in the character, and performing the proper work of Bi&s;hops; which &s;urely includes government, as well as in&s;truction. If governing authority is not, in the&s;e texts, committed to Pre&s;byters, and by apo&s;tolic in&s;titution too, there are no words in which it can be done. Let the Dr. produce only a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age, any where in the New te&s;tament, that mentions Bi&s;hops, in his appropriated &s;en&s;e, and entru&s;ts them with the affair of Church-Government, and we will then acknowledge he has done &s;omething to good purpo&s;e; which we do not think he has done as yet.</P>
<P>ANOTHER power belonging to Bi&s;hops, &s;ays the Dr. is "<HI>ordination;</HI> which has always been con&s;i|dered by the friends of Epi&s;copacy, as PECULIAR to Bi&s;hops, and UNALIENABLE from their office". He does not here &s;peak the truth of fact, even
<PB N="38" REF="010853_0037_0F8522DC361A8A48">
&s;ince the &s;ettlement of Epi&s;copacy in England, after the reformation. The fir&s;t reformers, and hundreds of others, all along from their day, of high dignity in the Church, and the be&s;t character for piety and learning, have been of our mind as to the Identity of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, and that ordination was appropriated to Bi&s;hops by human con&s;titution only.</P>
<P>THE Dr. goes on, "with regard to the power of ordination, none, that have labored in the cau&s;e, have been able to &s;hew from &s;cripture a &s;ingle in|&s;tance, wherein this power has been exerci&s;ed by Pre&s;byters only". He &s;hould have added, in his opinion; for, in the opinion of judges far more learned in the &s;criptures, and all other wrtings, than he or I can mode&s;tly pretend to be, in&s;tances of this power of Pre&s;byters have been produced, and &s;uch as Epi&s;copalians have never yet been able to &s;et a&s;ide. He &s;ubjoins, in the immediately follow|ing words, "but there are many in&s;tances in which, tho&s;e who are manife&s;tly &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters are found to have u&s;ed it". Let him give us, from the &s;cripture, if he can, a &s;ingle in&s;tance of ordi|nation by any ORDINARY FIXED officer in the Church, that was of an higher order than that of Pre&s;byters. It is certain, though we have exam|ples, in &s;cripture, of ordination by extraordinary and ordinary officers, by Apo&s;tles, by Evangeli&s;ts, by Teachers, or common Pa&s;tors or Pre&s;byters; yet, we no where read, throughout the New-te&s;ta|ment, of &s;o much as one ordination by any per&s;on under the name or &s;tile of a Bi&s;hop. If what I &s;ay does not con&s;i&s;t with exact truth, the mi&s;take may be ea&s;ily &s;hewn; as the &s;acred books are open to every one's view.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="010853_0038_0F8522DCEF4D8EE0">
THE Dr. proceeds, "as to the ca&s;e of Timothy, whom St. Paul exhorts, in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to him, "not to neglect the gift which was given him by prophecy, <HI>with</HI> the laying on of the hands of the Pre&s;bytery", it will not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e". And why? Becau&s;e "in his &s;econd Epi&s;tle to him, he expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erts, that this &s;ame gift was imparted to him" <HI>by</HI> the laying on of his own hands". But how does the Dr. know, that the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> is &s;peaking of one and the &s;ame gift, in both the&s;e texts? He &s;hould have given us &s;ome proof of his knowledge, as to this point; for it is far from being certain, that the &s;ame gift is &s;poken of in the&s;e different Epi&s;tles, wrote at different times. Some of the be&s;t writers think it mo&s;t probable, that diffe|rent gifts are meant in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages. But &s;hould it be &s;uppo&s;ed, not granted, that the &s;ame gift is &s;poken of in both texts, and that this gift was the power communicated by ordination, how does it appear, that it was given by "the laying on of Paul's hands" only, and not by "the hands of the Pre&s;bytery" as truly? It is as po&s;itively &s;aid, in the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle, that it was given "with the lay|ing on of the hands of the Pre&s;bytery", as it is, in the &s;econd, that it was "by the laying on of Paul's hands". What then? Says the Dr. "ob&s;erve the difference between BY and WITH. Timothy re|ceived this gift "BY the impo&s;ition of St. Paul's hands", as being effectual to convey it; but it was only "WITH the impo&s;ition of the hands of the Pre&s;bytery", which implies not any power in them, but their concurrence only". Notably &s;aid! An irrefragable argument truly! The di&s;tinction the Dr. here makes between the ju&s;t import of the prepo&s;itions, meta, and dia, is altogether ground|le&s;s, and could be contrived for no other rea&s;on
<PB N="40" REF="010853_0039_0F8522DDF72C5808">
than to &s;erve a pre&s;ent turn. The&s;e prepo&s;itions are commonly u&s;ed, in the New-te&s;tament, as carrying in them the &s;ame force. An ob&s;ervable in&s;tance of this we have in the 15th chap. of the Acts. In the 4th ver. it is &s;aid of Paul and Barnabas, that "they declared all things God had done [meta] with them". In the 12th ver. the &s;ame thought is thus expre&s;&s;ed, they "declared what miracles and wonders God had wrought a|mong the Gentiles [dia] by them". The prepo|&s;ition, meta, in the 4th ver. has exactly the &s;ame force with the prepo&s;ition dia in the 12th ver. and might, with equal propriety, have been rendered <HI>by,</HI> as it is in the 12th ver. An in&s;trumental effi|ciency is the thing meant in both places. Many more in&s;tances might be brought of the like u&s;e of the&s;e prepo&s;itions, but that it would take up more room than can be here &s;pared. The Dr's &s;ug|ge&s;ting, that holy orders were conveyed to Timo|thy, &s;olely <HI>by</HI> Paul's hands, in virtue of the force of the prepo&s;ition dia; while, in virtue of the force of the word meta, <HI>with,</HI> nothing more is imported, by the impo&s;ition of the hands of the Pre&s;bytery, than their concurring with, or approbating the apo&s;tle Paul's act, which wholly communicated the power, is nothing better than an arbitrary inven|tion to &s;upport a &s;inking cau&s;e. In this view of the matter, any private members of the Church might have "laid on hands" in Timothy's ordi|nation, with as much pertinency as it's Pre&s;byters. It cannot, with the lea&s;t &s;hadow of rea&s;on, be &s;up|po&s;ed, that an in&s;pired Apo&s;tle would have called in a number of Pre&s;byters to join with him in the &s;acred &s;olemnity of "impo&s;ing hands", if they had not a right, as officers in the Church of Chri&s;t, to perform this action; and their performing it is a
<PB N="41" REF="010853_0040_0F8522DEAF35B180">
&s;ure argument of their right to do the thing in|tended by it, that is, &s;eparate a per&s;on to the work of the Go&s;pel-mini&s;try: As they that have a right to apply water in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the holy Gho&s;t, have a right to bapti&s;e; and they that have a right to &s;et apart bread and wine, and di&s;tribute it to the people, have a right to admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help ob&s;erving here, if it had been in the Dr's power to have turned us to a text of &s;cripture, in which it is declared, that the mini&s;te|rial gift was given "WITH [meta] the laying on of the hands of the EPISCOPATE, he would have triumphed in it, as a deci&s;ive argument in his favor. And &s;hould it have been objected, that this gift was al&s;o &s;aid to be given "BY [dia] the laying on of the hands of Paul", and that, in con|&s;ideration of the peculiar force of the prepo&s;ition BY [dia] HE it was that conveyed the gift; but that the EPISCOPATE only &s;ignified their concur|rence in the affair; I &s;ay, &s;hould &s;uch an objection have been made, I doubt not, it would have been attributed to a "wrangling captious di&s;po&s;ition", not to &s;ay any thing wor&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is added, in the next following words, "St. Paul could have ordained without their concur|rence, but the impo&s;ition of their hands would have been altogether unavailable without his". We &s;ay, on the contrary, and our bare word carries as much convincing weight with it as their's, that this Pre&s;byterian-con&s;i&s;tory might have ordained Timothy without the apo&s;tle Paul, as he might have done it without them; and, in either ca&s;e, the ordination would have been valid to all the
<PB N="42" REF="010853_0041_0F8522DF85E5A0D8">
purpo&s;es of the Go&s;pel-mini&s;try. If the pa&s;&s;ion of &s;hame, excited in the Dr. had operated with a little more &s;trength, he would not, by "repeat|ing things which have been &s;o frequently &s;aid by others", have made it nece&s;&s;ary that we al&s;o &s;hould do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>HE has &s;een fit to &s;ay only two things more, in &s;upport of the peculiar unalienable right of Bi&s;hops, in the appropriated &s;en&s;e, to ordain.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is, that "no in&s;tance of ordination, performed by meer Pre&s;byters, can be found in the Church for &s;everal ages. Aerius &amp; Colluthus, in the fourth Century, &s;eem to have been the fir&s;t con|trivers of ordinations of this &s;ort". So we were told in a book, intituled "a mode&s;t proof of the Government &s;ettled by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles in the Church", publi&s;hed here and di&s;per&s;ed about forty years ago; which was &s;oon an&s;wered by the late worthy Dr. Wiggle&s;worth, and in &s;o ma&s;terly a way, in his "&s;ober remarks", that this blu&s;ter|ing pretence has lain dorment ever &s;ince; and it would have been more to the Dr's honor to have &s;uffered it to continue in this &s;tate of oblivion, than to have revived it with only a bare mention of it, and refering his readers to "Hooker's Eccles. Polity, and Arch-Bi&s;hop Potter's very excellent di&s;cour&s;e of Church-government". Epiphanius was the fir&s;t that found fault with Aerius, &s;tigmati&s;ing him as an Heretic. And why did he thus condemn him? Was it <HI>only</HI> or <HI>meerly</HI> for his opinion concerning the <HI>parity</HI> of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters? Far from it. He zealou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the lawfulne&s;s of PRAYING FOR THE DEAD. Epiphanius was a &s;tickler for this rank &s;uper&s;tition, now coming into practice,
<PB N="43" REF="010853_0042_0F8522E0202249B0">
and could not bear to have it expo&s;ed. The He|re&s;ies therefore he taxed Aerius with, were the IDENTITY of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, and the un|lawfulne&s;s of PRAYING FOR THE DEAD; Here|&s;ies, as Dr. Wiggle&s;worth writes, <Q>of much the &s;ame nature, and Epiphanius's confutation of them both equally learned and &s;atisfactory: For it is ob&s;ervable, that, in the &s;ame place, where he condemns that mon&s;trous Here&s;y of the Identity of order, he fairly confe&s;&s;es, that, by the two orders of Pre&s;byters and Deacons, all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical offices might be performed. To this I &s;hall only add the words of the learned Dr. Stillingfleet, who &s;ays, if Aerius was an Heretic for holding the <HI>Identity of order,</HI> it is &s;trange that Epiphanius &s;hould be the fir&s;t man that &s;hould charge him with it; and that neither Socrates, Sozoman, Theodoret, nor Evagrius, before who&s;e time he lived, &s;hould cen&s;ure him for it. And why &s;hould not Jerom have been equally animadverted upon, who is as expre&s;s in this as any man in the world.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sober remarks, pag. 4, 5.</NOTE> There was no need, nor any rea&s;on, to join <HI>Colluthus</HI> with <HI>Aerius;</HI> for he did not act in the capacity of, what Epi&s;copalians would call, a meer Pre&s;byter, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>ordaining;</HI> but as a Bi&s;hop. Dr. Stillingfleet has proved, from Blondel's apology, that he was a Bi&s;hop of the Meletian party in Cynus, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been ordained a Bi&s;hop by Me|letius.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P>As the Dr. has been plea&s;ed to &s;ay, "no in&s;tance of an ordination by meer Pre&s;byters can be found
<PB N="44" REF="010853_0043_0F8522E10F3E6B88">
in the Church for &s;everal ages", we might natu|rally conclude there are numerous examples of Epi&s;copal ordination in the&s;e &s;everal ages. We &s;hould take it kindly to have pointed out to us &s;o much as ONE in&s;tance, within the long period of an hundred and fifty years from Chri&s;t, of an or|dination by any Bi&s;hop, in any part of the chri&s;tian world; meaning by a Bi&s;hop, an officer in the Church of a &s;uperior order to that of Pre&s;byters. I have lately been looking over the extracts I made twenty years ago, from the fathers of the two fir&s;t Centuries, containing every thing in their writings that might be thought to have relation to the pre|&s;ent controver&s;y; and I don't find a &s;ingle exam|ple of an ordination by Bi&s;hops, in the appropri|ated &s;en&s;e, within the time before &s;pecified. If the Dr. would pre&s;ent us with one from his own know|ledge, or by communication from the convened body that appointed him to write, it would be, to me, a great favor, as hereby I might fill up an e&s;&s;ential vacancy in my extracts, and render them quite perfect: And, be&s;ides it's being a gratifica|tion to me, it would be a va&s;t help to the Epi&s;co|pal cau&s;e, and, in a good mea&s;ure, ju&s;tifie the Chal|lenge, prelatical writers &s;ometimes triumphantly make, calling upon their opponents to give an in|&s;tance of Pre&s;byterian-ordination for &s;ome Cen|turies.</P>
<P>THE other thing, with which the Dr. fini&s;hes what he thought proper to &s;ay upon the head of ordination, is, that "from this time, [the fourth Century] until after the beginning of the refor|mation in the &s;ixteenth Century, no in&s;tances wor|thy of notice occur to favor ordination by Pre&s;by|ters". He had before &s;aid, Aerius and Colluthus
<PB N="45" REF="010853_0044_0F8522E1CBE86A88">
were the fir&s;t contrivers of ordination by Pre&s;by|ters; &s;o that, according to him, there were no in|&s;tances in this kind until the fourth Century, the age in which they lived. How does this agree with the account of Eutichius, who &s;ays, "that the twelve Pre&s;byters con&s;tituted by Mark, in the See of Alexandria, cho&s;e out one of their number to be head over the re&s;t, and the other eleven, laid hands on him, and ble&s;&s;ed him, and made him Patriarch"?&mdash;Or with the account, Jerom, more ancient than he, has given us of the &s;ame fact, &s;aying, "at Alexandria, from St. Mark to Hera|clius and Diony&s;ius, Bi&s;hops, the Prie&s;ts always took one out from among them&s;elves, whom they &s;et in the highe&s;t &s;eat, and called Bi&s;hop, ju&s;t as an army makes an Emperor, or as if the Deacons &s;hould chu&s;e one out of their number, and call him an Arch-Deacon"? The&s;e are in&s;tances that are to be met with in mo&s;t writers on our &s;ide of the que&s;tion. A great variety of ca&s;es al&s;o, in proof of Pre&s;byterian-ordination, within the time &s;pecified by the Dr. may be &s;een in Dr. Stillingfleet's Iren|icum, pag. 374. and onwards. He is egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken likewi&s;e in &s;aying, that, from the fourth Century, until the beginning of the reformation in the &s;ixteenth, "no in&s;tances worthy of notice occur to favor ordination by Pre&s;byters". What he may think worthy of notice I cannot tell; but ordinations, in this kind, were common many ages before the reformation he &s;peaks of, and as worthy of &s;pecial notice as any Epi&s;coapal ones &s;ince.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Says Mr. Daniel Williams, in his preface to Mr. J.

would here a&s;k the Dr. in the words of that emi|nently learned man, the late reverend Mr. Thomas Walter of Roxbury, <Q>whether the Vaudois of Piedmont were not much ancienter than two hundred years? Leger has &s;ufficiently demon|&s;trated their antiquity, and proved, that the Walden&s;es were long before the time of Peter Valdo, which name (as they are now called Vaudois from the word Vaux, that &s;ignifies a valley) belonged to them as inhabiting the vallies of the Alps. We will take their cha|racter and hi&s;tory from a &s;worn enemy of their's, from Claudius Se&s;&s;elius, the Arch-Bi&s;hop of Turin, in a book which he wrote again&s;t them.

religious, joined them&s;elves unto them. Al&s;o Requerus Sacco, the celebrated inqui&s;itor, quoted by the Je&s;uit Cretzer, in his Bibliotheque of the fathers, a&s;&s;erts, that among all the &s;ects there is none that has been &s;o pernicious to the Church of Rome, as that of the Leoni&s;ts, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t ancient, and has continued longe&s;t: For &s;ome affirm, that it began in the time of Sylve&s;ter, and others &s;ay, in the time of the Apo&s;tles. The Fryar Belvedoras, excu&s;ing the Mi&s;&s;ionaries for their not converting one of the&s;e Walden&s;es, a&s;&s;igns this rea&s;on for it, that their Here&s;ie was too firmly rooted for any to be able to do good among them: They of the Valleys have been always, and through all times, accounted Heretics.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Walter's Reply to the di&s;cour&s;e of Epi&s;copacy, pag. 82, 83.</NOTE></Q> So that, upon the whole, the Dr's "uniform practice of the Church for fifteen hundred years", is as de&s;titute of evi|dence from antiquity, as the nece&s;&s;ity of Epi&s;copal ordination is from the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>HE now comes to the la&s;t branch of the Epi&s;|copal office, "impo&s;ition of hands in confirmati|on"; concerning which, after explaining the na|ture and de&s;ign of this rite, he &s;ays, "the Church of England declares, that it hath been a &s;olemn, ancient and laudable cu&s;tom, continued from the Apo&s;tles time". And here his rea&s;oning is emi|nently curious. "If this cu&s;tom has been <HI>from</HI> the Apo&s;tles, it mu&s;t have been practi&s;ed <HI>in</HI> their time; for, in the language of the &s;chools, the <HI>terminus &agrave; quo</HI> is in the time of the Apo|&s;tles. And it can with no propriety be &s;aid to have been continued <HI>from</HI> their time, if it com|menced

<PB N="48" REF="010853_0047_0F8522E51C3D1488">
<HI>after</HI> it". Demon&s;trably argued! But to what purpo&s;e? May it not be true, that this was a cu&s;tom neither in the Apo&s;tles days, nor within the truly primitive times, though it be granted the Church of England &s;ays "it continued from the Apo&s;tles times"; and if &s;o, that it was their judg|ment, in con&s;equence of the Dr's learned rea&s;oning, that it was in u&s;e by the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves? Is infallibility the peculiar priviledge of this Church? Will it a&s;certain the truth of a di&s;puted fact, to &s;ay the Church of England affirms it to be one? Some farther proof is nece&s;&s;ary. The Dr. &s;eems &s;en&s;ible of it, and goes on to "&s;ee what information the &s;cripture gives us, relating to this &s;ubject". And he particularly mentions three texts to his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is, Acts 8. 14&mdash;17. which gives an account of Peter and John as &s;ent to Samaria, who, when they were come, "prayed for them that they might receive the holy Gho&s;t; and laying their hands on them, they received the holy Gho&s;t". The&s;e words, &s;ays the Dr. "exactly de&s;cribe confir|mation as practi&s;ed in the Church of England, and there is hardly room for a po&s;&s;ibility of applying them to any thing el&s;e". It is as evident as words can well make it, that the impo&s;ition of hands by the Apo&s;tles, &s;poken of in this text, was for the im|partation of the holy Gho&s;t in MIRACULOUS GIFTS. For it is &s;aid of Simon the &s;orcerer, ver. 13. that he "wondered, beholding the miracles and &s;igns which were done"; and, in the 18th ver. that "when he &s;aw, that, through the laying on of the Apo&s;tles hands, the holy Gho&s;t was given", that is, a power to do tho&s;e miracles and &s;igns, "he offered them money, &s;aying, give me al&s;o this power, that on whom&s;oever I lay hands, he may receive the holy
<PB N="49" REF="010853_0048_0F8522E561CC9680">
Gho&s;t", that is, the ability of working wonders&punc; Will the Dr. in &s;ober &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ay, that there is any likene&s;s between the impo&s;ition of a Bi&s;hop's hands in confirmation, and this laying on of the Apo&s;tles hands, as to it's u&s;e and end? Was any miraculous power ever conveyed, in this way, by any Bi&s;hop of the Church of England to any one his hands were laid upon? Does any Bi&s;hop, &s;ince the days of Popery, pretend to impart this power? Why then is this text brought in proof of the doctrine of confirmation? Might it not be rea|&s;onably thought, that prejudice it&s;elf could not find a po&s;&s;ibility of applying it to this purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>THE &s;econd text is that in Acts 20. 7. which contains, &s;ays the Dr. "another in&s;tance of confir|mation in the di&s;ciples at Ephe&s;us, on whom, "after they were bapti&s;ed", St. Paul "laid his hands, and the holy Gho&s;t came upon them". He has here &s;hamefully &s;topt &s;hort in the middle of a &s;entence, keeping out of &s;ight a nece&s;&s;ary part of it. For it follows immediately, and in order to fini&s;h the &s;entence, "and they SPAKE WITH TONGUES, and PROPHESIED". Is this fair? Does it carry the appearance of that impartial uprightne&s;s, which becomes every hone&s;t writer? Can any imaginable rea&s;on be a&s;&s;igned for his thus curtailing the text, but only this, that if he had given it in whole, it would have been, at once, vi&s;ible to his readers, that it was nothing to his purpo&s;e? And this will always be the truth, until it appears, that bapti&s;ed per&s;ons, upon a Bi&s;hop's laying his hands on them, are able to "&s;peak with tongues, and prophe&s;ie".</P>
<P>THE la&s;t text is that in the Epi&s;tle to the He|brews, chap. 6. ver. 2. where, it's author, among other things, &s;peaks of "the laying on of hands".
<PB N="50" REF="010853_0049_0F8522E8426B52E0">
We read of the Apo&s;tles, as "laying on their hands" in the following ca&s;es; in ordination, in healing the &s;ick, and in conveying miraculous powers; but in no other that I can recollect at pre&s;ent. In which&s;oever of the&s;e &s;en&s;es "the lay|ing on of hands" is here under&s;tood, it makes no|thing to the Dr's purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>HE takes notice of two objections again&s;t what he had offered, from &s;cripture, in proof of this rite of confirmation.</P>
<P>ONE is, that "the&s;e in&s;tances prove only what was actually practi&s;ed by the Apo&s;tles, but not that this rite was intended to be of &s;tanding u&s;e to the Church in all ages". And, in reply, he round|ly affirms, that "confirmation was practi&s;ed by the IMMEDIATE &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles, and has been UNIVERSALLY CONTINUED through all the ages of the Church, until within the&s;e two Cen|turies"; and that this "mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed by all that have the LEAST ACQUAINTANCE with Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory". This is not the fir&s;t time the Dr. has di&s;covered his want of knowledge in the ancient writings; nor the fir&s;t time he has, with great a&s;&s;urance, declared that to be true, which o|thers know to be fal&s;e. It is well known to tho&s;e, who are tolerably ver&s;ed in antiquity, though the Dr &s;eems quite ignorant of it, that NO INSTANCE of confirmation is to be met with, in any of the writings of the fathers, until towards the clo&s;e of the &s;econd, or rather the coming in of the third Century, I now tell him what may appear a new and &s;trange thing to him, that Tertullian is the olde&s;t father who &s;peaks of this rite of confirma|tion; and I could tell him of &s;everal other &s;uper|&s;titious
<PB N="51" REF="010853_0050_0F8522E8EB607630">
rites that were, by this time, brought into practice. And if he will be at the pains to con&s;ult Mr. Pierce's vindication of Di&s;&s;enters, or the di&s;&s;en|ting Gentleman's an&s;wer to White, he will find, that confirmation, in tho&s;e days, was always per|formed, not as it is in the Church of England, but IMMEDIATELY after Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>THE other objection the Dr. con&s;iders is, "that from the in&s;tances of confirmation [he &s;hould have &s;aid, of the laying on of the Apo&s;tles hands] re|corded in &s;cripture, the effects of it appear to have been miraculous; and as the power of miracles has long &s;ince cea&s;ed, this rite is now u&s;ele&s;s, and ought not to be continued". But, &s;ays he, "the &s;olution of this objection is not difficult". How then does he &s;olve it? Why, by cautiou&s;ly avoid|ing to &s;ay any thing upon it that is really to the purpo&s;e. For though he &s;ays, miraculous gifts were imparted by the impo&s;ition of the Apo&s;tles hands, and other gifts al&s;o of a different nature, meaning hereby "the gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tances of the holy Spirit, without which it is as certain now, as it ever was, that no man can fulfil the conditions of the Go&s;pel-covenant"; yet he does not venture to go on, and affirm, that either of the&s;e gifts are imparted by Bi&s;hops to tho&s;e, upon whom they lay their hands in confirmation; or that Bi&s;hops have, or pretend to have, in the&s;e days, this power of communication. And if they have no power to impart the holy Gho&s;t, either in miraculous gifts, or gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tances, why &s;hould they u&s;e that rite or ceremony by which the Apo&s;tles did this? "Might they not as well, to &s;peak here in the words of an excellent writer,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ent. Gentleman's an&s;wer to White, pag. 45.</NOTE> &s;tretch them&s;elves

<P>I SHALL fini&s;h what I have to &s;ay, upon this head of confirmation, by addre&s;&s;ing to the Dr. in the language of the above quoted author to Mr. White, <Q>By the order of your common prayer, all per&s;ons bapti&s;ed, when they come to compe|tent years, and are able to &s;ay the Lord's prayer, Creed, and ten Commandments, and the an&s;wers of the &s;hort Catechi&s;m, are to be brought to con|firmation. The Bi&s;hop having a&s;ked, whe|ther they renew the &s;olemn promi&s;e and vow which was made in their names in bapti&s;m, &amp;c; upon their an&s;wer, we do, proceeds hereupon to declare, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn man|ner, even in an addre&s;s to God him&s;elf, that he has vouch&s;afed to <HI>regenerate</HI> the&s;e his &s;ervants by water and the HOLY GHOST, (note: Not by water only, but al&s;o by the HOLY GHOST) and to give them the <HI>forgivene&s;s of all their &s;ins:</HI> And laying his hand upon each particular per|&s;on, he CERTIFIES him by that &s;ign of God's favor and gracious goodne&s;s towards him. I pray you, Sir, in the name of God, inform me, what warrant has the Bi&s;hop to pronounce a man's &s;ins ALL FORGIVEN, and him&s;elf RE|GENERATED by the HOLY GHOST, upon no o|ther grounds than his being able to &s;ay the &s;hort

Catechi&s;m, and declaring that he &s;tands by his bapti&s;mal engagements? Will you &s;ay that this is the chri&s;tian doctrine concerning the terms of acceptance and forgivene&s;s with God?&mdash;Are there not multitudes who call Chri&s;t their Lord, and publicly profe&s;s to &s;tand by their bapti&s;mal covenant, whom yet he will reject with abhor|rence at la&s;t? You will then inform me, Sir, how his Lord&s;hip, upon this meer profe&s;&s;ion and promi&s;e, pre&s;umes to declare to almighty God, and to ASSURE the per&s;on, that he is REGENE|RATED, FORGIVEN, and without all peradven|ture in a &s;tate of favor with heaven! The ex|pre&s;&s;ions, you mu&s;t acknowledge, are couched in ab&s;olute and &s;trong terms&punc; Nor do I find that there is any intimation, that their forgive|ne&s;s depends upon their care to keep, and to live up to, their bapti&s;mal engagements. No: But though their whole life hath hitherto been &s;candalou&s;ly corrupt; yet upon their being able to &s;ay the Lord's prayer, &amp;c. the Bi&s;hop &s;o|lemnly pronounces a mo&s;t ab&s;olute pardon over them; appeals to almighty God that he hath forgiven them all their &s;ins; and le&s;t this &s;hould be too little to &s;atisfie the doubting &s;inner, and qua&s;h his upbraiding con&s;cience, he lays his hand upon his head, and CERTIFIES him, by that &s;ign, of God's favor and goodne&s;s to him.&mdash;To me, Sir, I a&s;&s;ure you, this appears, I do not &s;ay a very &s;hocking, but I mu&s;t &s;ay a very unaccoun|table &s;olemnity; and &s;hould be glad to know how to reconcile it to the reverence you owe to God, or to the faithfulne&s;s and charity due to the &s;ouls of men.&mdash;Whether the continuance of this ceremony, in it's pre&s;ent form of admini|&s;tration, be either for the honor of the admini|&s;trator,

<HEAD>ANSWER to SECTION III. which declares, the Church in AMERICA, without an Epi&s;co|pate, is nece&s;&s;arily de&s;titute of a regular Go|vernment, and cannot enjoy the Benefits of Ordination and Confirmation.</HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;ign of the Dr. in this Section, is, to &s;et before the Public the "wretched con|dition" of the Epi&s;copal Churches in the Colonies "for want of Bi&s;hops". And it's lamentably bad &s;tate lies in this, pag. 27. that "if, according to the doctrine and belief of the Church of England, none have a right to govern the Church but Bi|&s;hops, nor to ordain, nor to confirm; then the American Church, while without Bi&s;hops, mu&s;t be without Government, without Ordination and Confirmation".</P>
<P>As to confirmation, it is acknowledged, they mu&s;t be in want of it without Bi&s;hops, becau&s;e they only can perform this piece of &s;ervice, con|formably to the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of the Engli&s;h Church. But this, though a "great grievance", is yet pa&s;&s;ed over without "enlargement", as not being &s;uted, I &s;uppo&s;e, to the Colony-ta&s;te, and the other "more important points of Government and Ordination" immediately proceeded to, and

di&s;tinctly con&s;idered. I &s;hall follow the Dr. in his own way. Only, before I come to take notice of what he has offered upon the&s;e "more important" heads, I &s;hall not think it needle&s;s to make the two following remarks.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t relates to the&s;e words, pag. 27. "ac|cording to the doctrine and belief of the Church of England, NONE have a right to govern the Church but Bi&s;hops". It is added, in a marginal note here, "the reader will ob&s;erve, that only &s;uch authority is &s;poken of as is purely Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and peculiar to the officers of the Church. The King's &s;upremacy, as expre&s;&s;ed in article XXXVII, is maintained by the Church in America, in as full and ample manner as in England". What I would ob&s;erve here is, the difficulty, I may rather &s;ay the impo&s;&s;ibility of conceiving how it &s;hould be be|lieved, that "NONE but Bi&s;hops have a right to govern the Church", while it is, at the &s;ame time believed, that the "KING is the &s;upreme Governor of it", according to the article refer'd to, which declares, that he hath the CHIEF POWER, the CHIEF GOVERNMENT in all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es. The King's &s;upremacy in the Church means no|thing &s;hort of this, that he is <Q>ve&s;ted with all power to exerci&s;e all manner of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction; and that Arch-Bi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, Arch-Deacons, and other Eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons, have no manner of juri&s;diction Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, but by and under the King's Maje&s;ty, who hath full power and authority to hear and determine all manner of cau&s;es Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and to reform and correct all vice, &s;in, errors, here&s;ies, enor|mities, abu&s;es what&s;oever, which by any manner of &s;piritual authority or juri&s;diction ought, or

may be lawfully reformed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ent. Gentleman's an&s;wer to Mr. White, pag. 24. in which he refers to 26th Henry VIII. cap. 137.&mdash;Henry VIII. cap. xvii. 1 Eliz. cap. 1. See al&s;o Burn, on Eccle&s;ia&s;tical law, under the word, <HI>Supremacy;</HI> where the &s;everal acts of Parliament, relative to this &s;ubject, in the reigns of Henry 8th, Edward 6th, Eli|zabeth, and William and Mary, are cited; where likewi&s;e it will be found, "that no per&s;on &s;hall be re|ceived into the mini&s;try, nor admitted to any Eccle&s;ia|&s;tical function, except he &s;hall fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cribe (among others) to this article following; "that the King's Maje&s;ty under God is the ONLY SUPREME GOVERNOR of this realm, and of all other his Highne&s;&s;es's domi|nions and countries, as well in ALL SPIRITUAL of ECCLESIASTICAL things, as temporal".&mdash;</NOTE></Q> Bi&s;hops there|fore, are &s;o far from being "the ONLY Governors of the Church", that they are nothing more than &s;ubordinate rulers, dependent on the King, who, by their own acknowledgement, is placed over them as their SUPREME head. The plain truth is, as to authority, "purely Eccle&s;ia&s;tical", there is no &s;uch thing in the Church of England. Whatever au|thority it's Clergy, whether &s;uperior or inferior, are ve&s;ted with, it is, in all it's branches, both granted and regulated by the &s;tate, and ab&s;olutely under it's controul; in&s;omuch, that, be their &s;piritual powers as you plea&s;e, they have no right, by the con&s;titution of the Church, to put them into ex|erci&s;e, but in the preci&s;e way that has been pre|&s;cribed to them; nor can they do it in any one in&s;tance. No Bi&s;hop in England, not all the Bi|&s;hops united in a body, with all that plenitude of power that has been derived to them in a direct line from the Apo&s;tles, have a con&s;titutional right to make the lea&s;t alteration in the e&s;tabli&s;hed form of wor&s;hip, ordination, or di&s;cipline. They are
<PB N="58" REF="010853_0057_0F8522F329C13968">
re&s;trained within certain bounds, beyond which they have no authority, and can no more exerci&s;e it than any common Layman. This is the "doct|rine and belief of the Church of England"; and yet, according to the doctrine and belief of this &s;ame Church, as the Dr. &s;ays, "NONE have a right to govern it but Bi&s;hops". He may, perhaps, find it difficult, upon tryal, to make both parts of this contradiction true. The &s;hort of the ca&s;e is, Bi|&s;hops, with the whole Church-Clergy, are CREA|TURES of the &s;tate, and the Church it&s;elf a PAR|LIAMENTARY Church. The di&s;&s;enting gentle|man, in his an&s;wer to Mr. White, has &s;et this mat|ter in a &s;trong point of light. Says he,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 9, 10.</NOTE> <Q>You need not be informed, Sir, that all the Clergy of this Kingdom, with all the Bi&s;hops at their head, have not the lea&s;t authority to enjoin one ceremony or rite of wor&s;hip; or to either e&s;ta|bli&s;h or annul one article of faith. No, but all power and juri&s;diction is lodged chiefly in Lay-hands; it is &s;olely in the KING and PARLIA|MENT, and the Clergy are to act in all things under their direction and controul. The KING and PARLIAMENT are in truth the real Fathers, Governors, or Bi&s;hops of this Church: The&s;e only have power to make or unmake forms and rites of wor&s;hip, and do AUTHORITATIVELY in&s;truct and pre&s;cribe to the Clergy what they are to believe&mdash;in what manner, and to whom the &s;acraments are to be given&mdash;what prayers they are to offer up&mdash;what doctrine to preach&mdash;who are to be admitted to the Epi&s;copate or Prie&s;thood, and who to be refu&s;ed&mdash;by what ceremonies, prayers, and exhortations they are to be &s;et apart, and con&s;ecrated to their office.&mdash;The&s;e, with every other circum&s;tance relating to
<PB N="59" REF="010853_0058_0F8522F39FB533E8">
religion and the wor&s;hip of God, which is AU|THORITATIVELY pre&s;cribed or enjoined in your Church, you know, Sir, not the Bi&s;hops and Clergy, but the KING with his PARLIAMENT, are the ONLY per&s;ons who have AUTHORITA|TIVELY enjoined and pre&s;cribed them. The Clergy of the whole land, in convocation a&s;&s;em|bled, cannot &s;o much as attempt any canons or con&s;titutions without the KING'S <HI>licence,</HI>&mdash;yea, &s;o far Sir, were the Bi&s;hops and Clergy from having any hand in the fir&s;t forming our pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, or in ordering it's rites and articles of faith, that it was done not only WITH|OUT, but in actual OPPOSITION to them. For in the 1&s;t of Queen Eli&s;abeth, the PARLIAMENT ALONE e&s;tabli&s;hed the Queen's &s;upremacy, and the Common-prayer-book, in &s;pite of all oppo&s;i|tion from the Bi&s;hops in the hou&s;e of Lords; and the Convocation, then &s;itting, were &s;o far from having any hand in tho&s;e Church-acts for reformation, that they pre&s;ented to the Par|liament &s;everal propo&s;itions in behalf of the Tenets of POPERY, directly contrary to the pro|ceedings of the Parliament. Hence, Sir, I think you mu&s;t be ab&s;olutely forced to own (what I know gentlemen of your robe do not care to hear) that the Church of England is really a PARLIAMENTARY Church; that it is not pro|perly an ALLY, but a MERE CREATURE of the &s;tate. It depends intirely upon the acts and authority of PARLIAMENT for it's very e&s;&s;ence and frame.</Q></P>
<P>THE other remark, though not e&s;&s;entially im|portant, may yet be worthy of notice. It's de&s;ign is to point out a great and manife&s;t difference be|twixt
<PB N="60" REF="010853_0059_0F8522F4718D8048">
the complaint as made at the head of this Section, and in the paragraph &s;ome words of which we have been con&s;idering, and it's vindication after|wards. The ground of complaint, as there &s;peci|fied, is this, the Church of England in America, being without Bi&s;hops, mu&s;t, for that rea&s;on, "be without government and ordination": Whereas, the ju&s;tification of this complaint does not proceed upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, either that they have "no government", or can have "no ordination"; but that their government without Bi&s;hops is incom|plete and in&s;ufficient, and that ordination cannot be had without difficulty, danger and expence. No government, and that which is incomplete; no ordination, and ordination with inconvenience and charge, are quite different things. The com|plaint therefore &s;hould not have been made in ab|&s;olute terms, as it's illu&s;tration is attempted in a re&s;tained mitigated &s;en&s;e only. There would not then have been a di&s;agreement betwixt them, as there certainly is as they now &s;tand. Let it be re|membered, it is only in the re&s;trained &s;en&s;e of this complaint that I am called to con&s;ider it. Hav|ing ob&s;erved the&s;e things, the way is prepared to go on.</P>
<P>THE Dr. begins with the affair of "Govern|ment", and &s;ays, <Q>It is to be under&s;tood in a qua|lified &s;en&s;e. For where there is ab&s;olutely no government at all, there can be nothing but di&s;order and confu&s;ion; which, I tru&s;t, is not yet the ca&s;e of the Church in America.</Q> The Church then, by this "qualified &s;en&s;e", mitigating it's di&s;tre&s;s, is not in that "wretched condition", one was led to imagine when it was &s;aid, "while without Bi&s;hops it mu&s;t be without Government".</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="010853_0060_0F8522F5415F93E8">
IT follows in the next paragraph, <Q>It has been allowed, that Pre&s;byters may have a &s;ubordinate authority to govern; and it is well known, that the Bi&s;hop of London hath formerly taken &s;ome cognizance of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters in the Plan|tations, by virtue of the King's commi&s;&s;ion.</Q> If Pre&s;byters may act "authoratatively", in mat|ters of government, though their authority &s;hould be "&s;ubordinate", the Church is in a &s;till le&s;s de|plorable &s;tate than was repre&s;ented by the com|plaint, as at fir&s;t worded; e&s;pecially, if the Bi&s;hop of London may "take cognizance of their Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical matters". And it is evident he may, be|cau&s;e he has. That which has been may be again. But &s;ays the Dr. "much more than this is need|ful to an&s;wer the nece&s;&s;ities of the American Church. The Clergy can evidently do but little without a Bi&s;hop".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Dr. in a marginal note here, having hinted that there had been voluntary conventions of the Clergy in &s;ome of the Northern Colonies for a number of years, this being the mo&s;t they could do to relieve the Church in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, &s;ays, "Indeed &s;uch con|ventions of the Clergy, wherein all the members meet to|gether on terms of equality, are unknown to the Church of England". And they are equally unknown upon terms of inequality, at lea&s;t to act authoritatively as a body, in order to change, or amend any one order of the Church, or to make a new one. It would not there|fore be of any &s;ervice to have a Bi&s;hop at the head of the American conventions of the Clergy. If nothing more is intended by the&s;e conventions than to encou|rage and help one another, and unite their coun&s;els for the good of the Church, conformably to it's laws and canons, there is no need of a Bi&s;hop at their head: If their de&s;ign is to act as a body in an authoritative way, the con&s;titution of the Church forbids it. As to what follows, "that for &s;uch a number of Pre&s;byters to be left without a Bi&s;hop at their head to &s;uper-intend and govern them, it is a thing equally unknown to any Epi&s;copal Church on earth"; it may be &s;aid, there is &s;carce an Epi&s;copal prote&s;tant Church on the earth be&s;ides the Engli&s;h one: and this no more allows Pre&s;byters with a Bi&s;hop at their head, than by them|&s;elves alone, to do any thing authoritatively as a body. It is well known, there cannot be a convocation with|out the King's writ; nor can they when met do any thing without the King's licence; nor will any doing of their's be of binding force unle&s;s the King confirms it. I do not &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e conventions of the Clergy are unfavorably thought of at Home. None here object again&s;t them.</NOTE> And he might have added,
<PB N="62" REF="010853_0061_0F8522F6205943E8">
they can do but little with him, in point of di&s;ci|pline. The Church at home is, in this re&s;pect, in as lamentable a &s;tate as the Church in America, and it's "nece&s;&s;ities" as loudly call for redre&s;s. The Liturgy it&s;elf &s;uppo&s;es their di&s;cipline to be in a wretched condition. Why el&s;e is the Church taught, once a year, on A&s;h-Wedne&s;day, "to wi&s;h it's godly di&s;cipline re&s;tored"? But, notwith&s;tand|ing it's pious wi&s;hes, annually repeated, it remains &s;till in a deplorably bad &s;tate, Epi&s;copalians them|&s;elves being judges. Says the learned Dr Whit|by,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. his note on Rom. 14. 6.</NOTE> "The Church of England ob&s;erves no di&s;|cipline".

it out of Lay-hands, which have &s;o long pro|phaned it, and have expo&s;ed the authority of the Church, and the cen&s;ures of it, chiefly excom|munication, to the contempt of the nation; by which the reverence due to holy things is, in &s;o great a mea&s;ure, lo&s;t, and the dreadfulle&s;t of all cen&s;ures is now become the mo&s;t &s;corned and de&s;pi&s;ed.</Q> I &s;hall add here the complaint of a noted high Church-writer upon this head. <Q>Di&s;cipline, &s;ays he,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;e of the Regal. and Pontif. pag. 166.</NOTE> is lo&s;t, and will not be per|mitted by the &s;tate; which, by virtue of <HI>conge d' E&s;lire'</HI>s, <HI>Quare impedits, prohibitions,</HI> &amp;c. have made them&s;elves the &s;ole and ultimate judges, not only of all Bi&s;hops and Churches; but of their excommunications, and every exerci&s;e of their &s;piritual juri&s;diction.</Q> The plain truth is, the con&s;titution of the Church, at lea&s;t in the affair of di&s;cipline, is in a mi&s;erably defective, if not ruined, &s;tate. It greatly wants amendment; and unle&s;s it &s;hould va&s;tly differ in America from what it is in England, Bi&s;hops would be of little &s;ervice with re&s;pect to di&s;cipline. The Church may, perhaps, do as well without them, as with them.</P>
<P>THE Dr. &s;ays farther, "Tryal has heretofore been made what could be done by commi&s;&s;aries".&mdash;And why might not commi&s;&s;aries &s;upply the place of Bi&s;hops, at lea&s;t in regard of di&s;cipline? Per|haps, it will be found, upon examination, that Bi&s;hops can do little more than they might be able to do. "But their u&s;efulne&s;s (as it follows) upon the whole appeared to be &s;o incon&s;iderable, that none have been appointed for near twenty years". Po&s;&s;ibly, the rea&s;on of their not being u&s;eful was owing, not to the u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the office it&s;elf, but
<PB N="64" REF="010853_0063_0F8522F76C2F9988">
to it's not being filled with tho&s;e who were duly qualified for it. This, I believe, is the exact truth with reference to the la&s;t commi&s;&s;ary the Church had in the&s;e parts, and I know not but the only one it ever had. He was a native of England, and &s;ent from thence an utter &s;tranger to the people here. The Bi&s;hop of London could not therefore be impo&s;ed on by "ample credentials", relative to his character, from this part of the world. And yet, he was &s;o far from being &s;uperior to his bre|thren, that &s;ome of them, I know, would have tho't it a di&s;honor to be compared with him. Some|thing of his ju&s;t merit may be learned from the affair of Hopkington, as publi&s;hed by Dr. Mayhew, in one of his pieces on the di&s;pute about the con|duct of the Society for the propagation of the Go&s;pel in foreign parts. If no more care is taken as to the per&s;onal qualifications of Bi&s;hops, &s;hould they be &s;ent, I will venture to prophe&s;ie, that, in le&s;s than twenty years, even the Epi&s;copal-Clergy them&s;elves will be heartily &s;ick of them.</P>
<P>THE Dr. pag. 30. divides the government of the Church into "two branches", taking in both "the Clergy, and the Laity". But, before he comes to apply this divi&s;ion to the ca&s;e of the American Church, he interpo&s;es a few things which mu&s;t not pa&s;s unnoticed.</P>
<P>SAYS he, pag. ibid. <Q>What the ju&s;t penalties of obedience are, we mu&s;t learn from the nature of the Church it&s;elf.&mdash;The power of the Church is of a &s;piritual nature, and the utmo&s;t effect of it, in this world, is the cutting off and rejecting tho&s;e members which are incurably and danger|ou&s;ly corrupted.</Q>&mdash;This is certainly true of

the Church, con&s;idered, in it's proper &s;en&s;e, as "a kingdom that is not of this world". But it is really a&s;toni&s;hing, that he &s;hould make &s;piritual cen&s;ures the utmo&s;t effect of the power of the Church of England. He mu&s;t be very ignorant, if he did not know, that an <Q>excommunicated member is delivered over to the civil arm to humble and cha&s;ti&s;e him; is di&s;abled from a&s;&s;erting his na|tural rights, from being a witne&s;s&punc; from bring|ing actions at law, and, if he does not &s;ubmit in forty days, a writ &s;hall i&s;&s;ue forth to impri&s;on him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ent.

I cannot affirm, that the Church of England in the Colonies have not admitted tho&s;e to the Go&s;pel-privileges from among us, who&s;e moral conduct was an hindrance to their being admitted to them in our Churches; but this I will &s;ay, on the contrary, that no one, in like circum&s;tances, was ever received from Epi&s;|copal Churches into any of our's; and I dare ven|ture to engage; that this will never happen, unle&s;s we &s;hould become corrupt to a degree far beyond what has ever yet been our ca&s;e.

<P>THE Dr. now comes to the point in hand, the di&s;cipline of the Church under an American Epi&s;co|pate. And he enters upon it with a frank, hone&s;t acknowledgment, though it totally &s;ubverts all that

And yet, it is propo&s;ed, that this very thing, which cannot RATIONALLY BE ATTEMPTED", &s;hould not only be attempted, but carried into effect. It is &s;aid indeed, "no at|tempt of this nature will be made re&s;pecting the LAITY, under an American Epi&s;copate. The di&s;|cipline of the Church, &s;o far as it relates to the PRIVATE MEMBERS, will be left as it is".&mdash;But then, it is added, "with regard to the CLERGY, it is propo&s;ed, that a &s;trict di&s;cipline be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that the Bi&s;hop's power over them &s;hall be as full and complete, as the laws and canons of the Church direct". But why &s;hould the di&s;cipline, directed to by the laws of the Church, be confined to the Clergy, while the Laity are left without re|&s;traint? Judge ye that con&s;titute the Public, whe|ther this is rea&s;onable? Whether it con&s;i&s;ts, in any tolerable mea&s;ure, with the Go&s;pel-in&s;titution of di&s;cipline? Is not godly di&s;cipline as needful for the Laity as the Clergy? Are the Church-Clergy &s;o much wor&s;e than the Laity, that the latter may be left to them&s;elves, while "a &s;trict di&s;cipline &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed for the former? What would the Dr. have the world think of the Epi&s;copal-Clergy, by placing them in &s;o unfavorable a light? Be&s;ides, are not Bi&s;hops, as &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the Apo&s;tles, as much ve&s;ted with authority to govern the Laity as the Clergy? And why &s;hould their apo&s;tolic au|thority be thus limited by a meerly human e&s;ta|bli&s;hment?

It is really &s;urpri&s;ing, when Bi&s;hops are pleaded for as NECESSARY in order to di&s;cipline, that they &s;hould not be &s;uffered to exerci&s;e it, in &s;o important a branch as that of the government of the Laity!

<P>PERHAPS, it will be &s;aid, the lamentable &s;tate of the Church's di&s;cipline re&s;pects the Laity only. It would therefore be in vain to attempt it's re&s;to|ration in regard of them; though it may rea&s;ona|bly be attempted with re&s;pect to the Clergy. But this is a meer pretence. If there is any force in the argument taken from the wretched condition of the Church's di&s;cipline, it is equally &s;trong again&s;t it's being e&s;tabli&s;hed for the government of either.

This does often tear my heart. The ca&s;e is not much better in many, who, having got into orders, come for in&s;titution, and cannot make it appear, that they

Mr. Pierce complains upon this head. <Q>The Pari&s;honers, &s;ays he,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vind. of Di&s;&s;ent. pag. 562.</NOTE> in a very few places have that power, which, CYPRIAN &s;ays, belongs chiefly to the people, of CHUSING WORTHY PRIESTS, or REFUSING THOSE THAT ARE UN|WORTHY. If a Rector is to be placed in a Pari&s;h, the Patron of the living writes a letter to the Bi&s;hop, and recommends what Clergyman he plea&s;es to be put into it. The Bi&s;hop cannot re|fu&s;e the per&s;on thus recommended; and &s;o the Pari&s;honers, whether they will or no, are com|mitted to the care of that Pre&s;byter, cho&s;en by a &s;tranger, and, it may be, a notoriou&s;ly wicked per&s;on. It might, perhaps, &s;eem incredible a|broad, if I &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, that, in the Church of England, the be&s;t reformed Church, as they them&s;elves boa&s;t, in the world,&mdash;the right of Patronage is bought and &s;old; and that it is not reckoned &s;imony, nor any crime at all, for a per|&s;on to buy that right, or the next pre&s;entation of a living, provided it be not void at the time. Hence ignorant fellows, if they are but rich, often get the fatte&s;t benefices. And when they have got the livings, they are not bound to take care of the flock them&s;elves; it is enough if they leave &s;o trouble&s;ome a work to any &s;orry Curate, who will do it cheape&s;t. Nay, &s;ometimes the mini|&s;ter &s;hall have the income of two, three, or more pari&s;hes, who will not vouch&s;afe to take the pa&s;toral care of one.</Q> He adds from Bi&s;hop Burnet, <Q>what can we &s;ay, when we find often the poore&s;t clerks in the riche&s;t livings? Who&s;e in|cumbents, not content to devour the par&s;imony of the Church, while they <HI>feed them&s;elves, and not the flock</HI> out of it, are &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly hard in their
<PB N="74" REF="010853_0073_0F852304E0EFEE38">
allowance to their Curates, as if they intend|ed equally to &s;tarve both curate and peo|ple. Mr. Pierce ob&s;erves yet farther, they who have procured them&s;elves benefices may, in a manner, live as they plea&s;e. Several of our pre&s;ent Bi&s;hops, of eminent learning and piety, who would be glad to proceed again&s;t vicious Clergy-men, and turn them out of their livings, find them&s;elves hindered by our laws from doing it. Hence our nation abounds with di&s;&s;olute Clergy-men, the &s;hame of their Country, and the holy function.</Q> I may &s;ubjoin to what has been offered from the above writers, that a very great part of the Epi&s;copal-Clergy are only Curates, meer Underlings, hired to do the work which, in all rea&s;on and con&s;cience, ought to be done by o|thers; and at &s;o low a rate too, that, notwith&s;tand|ing the riches of the Church, they are, many of them, by rea&s;on of their poverty, made "contemp|tible and ba&s;e before all the people".</P>
<P>THUS mi&s;erably lax is the Church's di&s;cipline re&s;pecting the Clergy; and it's method of admi|ni&s;tration is &s;uch, that, while this continues, it will be as vain a thing to attempt a reform in regard of the Clergy, as the Laity. The government of the former is in as ill a &s;tate, as the government of the latter; and this, notwith&s;tanding they have &s;o many Bi&s;hops at their head, &s;uper-intending and directing their conduct: And no wonder, as the affair of di&s;cipline is in the hands of Chancellors, rather than Bi&s;hops. Says the Bi&s;hop of Hereford,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Naked Truth, pag. 58.</NOTE> <Q>If there be any thing in the office of a Bi&s;hop to be challenged peculiar to them&s;elves, certainly it &s;hould be this, (excommunication) yet this is

in a manner quite relinqui&s;hed to their Chancel|lors, Laymen, who have no more capacity to &s;entence or ab&s;olve a &s;inner, than to di&s;&s;olve the heavens or the earth&mdash;The Chancellor takes upon him to &s;entence not only Laymen, but Clergymen al&s;o brought into his court for any delinquency. And in the court of Arches, they &s;entence even Bi&s;hops them&s;elves.&mdash;He adds, I remember when the Bi&s;hop of Wells, hearing of a cau&s;e corruptly managed, and coming into court to rectifie it, the Chancellor Dr. Duck, fairly and mannerly bid him be gone, for he had no power to act any thing; and there|withall pulled out his Patent, &s;ealed by this Bi&s;hop's Predece&s;&s;or, which frightened the poor Bi&s;hop out of the court.</Q>&mdash;The e&s;tabli&s;hment of di&s;cipline here mu&s;t therefore be different from what it is at home, or it will be as truly incomplete with a Bi&s;hop at the head of the Clergy, as it is at pre&s;ent without one; and as in&s;ufficient for their government, as the government of the Laity.</P>
<P>THE Dr. goes on to repre&s;ent the nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;ta|bli&s;hing a &s;trict di&s;cipline in regard of the Clergy. But what he has offered is far le&s;s weighty than one would have expected in an affair he &s;eems to lay &s;o great &s;tre&s;s upon. He con&s;iders the Church-Clergy as either <HI>virtuous</HI> or <HI>vicious,</HI> and, in either ca&s;e, &s;ays, "the want of Bi&s;hops to &s;uper-intend and govern them, is obvious at fir&s;t view".</P>
<P>SAYS he, in ca&s;e of their being virtuous, <Q>if they have NO NEED of a Bi&s;hop to keep them to their duty, yet &s;ome ca&s;es will ari&s;e, in which his direction will be u&s;eful&mdash;and many ca&s;es, where|in his &s;upport and encouragement will be need|ful&mdash;
<PB N="76" REF="010853_0075_0F85230731BE0DF8">
and in all ca&s;es, his friend&s;hip and patronage will give life and &s;pirit to them in undergoing the difficulties, and in performing the duties, of their function.</Q> But what is all this to the af|fair of DISCIPLINE, the grand point in view? The Dr's bu&s;ine&s;s here was, to &s;hew it to be NECESSARY that STRICT DISCIPLINE &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed with re&s;pect to the Clergy; and he begins his ar|gument with a ca&s;e, wherein it is NOT NEEDED AT ALL. Is this pertinent to the propo&s;ed &s;ubject of debate? Might he not as well have left out what he has here &s;aid, as being little to the pur|po&s;e? Be&s;ides, the advantage here repre&s;ented by the mi&s;&s;ion of a Bi&s;hop is rather imaginary, than real. Was there now a Bi&s;hop in whatever part of America he would chu&s;e, the Clergy would not|with&s;tanding be variou&s;ly di&s;tant from him &s;ome hundreds of miles; in&s;omuch that but few of them could reap much benefit either by his direction, encouragement, or patronage; very little more, and with very little le&s;s difficulty, than if he was in England.</P>
<P>As to the Clergy of a vicious character, the Dr. goes on to &s;ay, "it is more immediately nece&s;&s;ary, on account of the&s;e, that Epi&s;copal Government &s;hould take place in America" And why? The following con&s;iderations are mentioned.</P>
<P>"THE proce&s;s of carrying on an accu&s;ation, and afterwards of &s;upporting it, at &s;o great a di&s;tance, mu&s;t be tedious and difficult, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, may cau&s;e tho&s;e to e&s;cape puni&s;hment who really de&s;erve it". Is not this a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of a proce&s;s at home, though there are Bi&s;hops there, and the ca&s;e may be carried on without a plea for
<PB N="77" REF="010853_0076_0F852308354F3398">
delay on account of this "great di&s;tance"? Have not multitudes "e&s;caped puni&s;hment" by this means, who richly de&s;erved it? And is not this the very rea&s;on that Epi&s;copalians them&s;elves, as well as Di&s;&s;enters, have often given, why there &s;hould be a reform of the admini&s;tration of di&s;cipline in the Engli&s;h Church? Have they not long complained of the difficulty, tediou&s;ne&s;s and expence, occa&s;ion|ed by the SPIRITUAL COURTS, and their manage|ment by Lay-chancellors? And this would be the complaint here, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ence of a Bi&s;hop. The Dr. indeed &s;ays, "the ca&s;e would be different under an Epi&s;copate; as then for any grievance of this nature, the Church would have an ea&s;ie and effectual remedy". Has not the Church this "ea&s;ie and effectual remedy" at home, under the government of Bi&s;hops? And yet, this grievance continues, and there is no pro&s;pect, at pre&s;ent, of it's being removed. And the ca&s;e would probably be much the &s;ame here, unle&s;s the e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of di&s;cipline &s;hould be &s;o changed, as to be quite different from what it is in England. But, if an alteration is to be made, it is infinitely rea&s;onable, it &s;hould fir&s;t take place at home, where it is mo&s;t needed. When it is effected there, it will be time enough to de&s;ire it here.</P>
<P>ANOTHER con&s;ideration the Dr. mentions is, "if a Clergyman &s;hall di&s;grace his profe&s;&s;ion in an open and &s;candalous manner, a Bi&s;hop re&s;iding in the Country might &s;u&s;pend him immediately". Why don't the Bi&s;hops do it at home, as &s;candalous Clergymen are not uncommon there? Be&s;ides, Commi&s;&s;aries might be ve&s;ted with the power of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion; and it is po&s;&s;ible tho&s;e might be found, who would exerci&s;e this power with as much wi&s;|dom, impartiality and faithfulne&s;s, as Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="010853_0077_0F852309C7B9FB48">
IT is added, "and if, upon tryal, the ca&s;e &s;hould be found to de&s;erve it, he can proceed to deprive him of his benefice, and not only &s;ilence and deprive him, but excommunicate him from the &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians". Ob&s;erve, the ca&s;e mu&s;t be TRIED be|fore the &s;u&s;pended Clergy-man can be deprived, &s;ilenced and excommunicated. But where is this ca&s;e to be tried? Can it be tried any where, con|formably to the mode of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, but in a SPIRITUAL COURT? To this court it be|longs to hear the ca&s;e, and, if it appears proper, to order the &s;entence of deprivation, or excommuni|cation. It can be done by this court only; and, &s;hould the &s;u&s;pended Clergy man be able to procure the Chancellor's judgment in his favor, he need not fear the whole power of the Bi&s;hop, &s;hould it be exerted again&s;t him. Now, this &s;piritual court mu&s;t be erected here, or the ca&s;e mu&s;t be carried home to &s;ome court there. If it is to be carried and &s;upported at home, the complaint of "tedi|ou&s;ne&s;s and difficulty" will remain in full force. If a court is erected here, it mu&s;t be quite changed from what it is in England, or there will be &s;till tedious difficuly, and great expence; in&s;omuch that, I doubt not, Epi&s;copalians them&s;elves would &s;oon be as earne&s;t in their de&s;ires to be delivered from it, as they now are to have Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved &s;till farther, "the Clergy's being under the eye of their Bi&s;hop will naturally tend to make them, in general, more regular and dili|gent in the di&s;charge of the duties of their office". If their being under the eye of the omnipre&s;ent, omni&s;cient God, will not make them regular and diligent, it is a vain thing to expect that their be|ing under "the eye of their Bi&s;hop" &s;hould do it.
<PB N="79" REF="010853_0078_0F85230A2233C490">
It certainly has not this effect at home; and it is not probable this would be the effect here. Be|&s;ides, it mu&s;t be by the help of a very &s;trong figure that they can be &s;aid to be under "their Bi&s;hop's eye, &s;o as to be much influenced by this con&s;ide|ration, when, by far the greater part of them, are fixed in cures, &s;ome fifty, &s;ome an hundred, and &s;ome two or three hundred miles from him; as they mu&s;t continue to be in America, unle&s;s the Church here has many more Bi&s;hops than have ever yet been talked of.</P>
<P>IN fine, it is &s;aid, "of tho&s;e who&s;e characters are ju&s;tly exceptionable, &s;ome may probably be re|formed by a Bi&s;hop; and, as to others, they may be ea&s;ily di&s;placed, unle&s;s it be the fault of the people them&s;elves" The reformation of vicious Clergy-men is not &s;o ea&s;ily effected. The Bi&s;hops at home find this to be a &s;ad truth. And no good rea&s;on can be given, why it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e here, though the Clergy had one or more Bi&s;hops at their head to govern them. As to the "di&s;|placing" unreformed Clergy-men, it has long been complained of in England, as one of the greate&s;t difficulties; and the difficulty would be much the &s;ame in America, under the &s;ame mode of admi|ni&s;tring Church-di&s;cipline; and there can be no other, unle&s;s the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution is departed from. And if it may in one in&s;tance, it may in another; and &s;o on until it has quite lo&s;t it's pre|&s;ent form.</P>
<P>I HAVE now taken notice of every thing the Dr. has &s;aid, in favor of an American-Epi&s;copate, up|on the head of <HI>di&s;cipline,</HI> and cannot but think, it will appear, that he has very much failed in what he
<PB N="80" REF="010853_0079_0F85230FA84A4CF0">
undertook to prove. The &s;um of what he has offered, and of what has been replied, is this;&mdash;He has hone&s;tly declared, as "the re&s;toration of primitive di&s;cipline cannot RATIONALLY BE AT|TEMPTED, no attempt of this nature will be made in regard of the Laity". And might he not, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, in full force, have &s;aid, neither will it be attempted with reference to the Clergy? But though it can NO MORE RATIONALLY BE AT|TEMPTED in regard of the one than the other; yet the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;trict di&s;cipline, under an Epi&s;copate, is pleaded for in regard of the Clergy, to the intire neglect of the Laity. And why? Becau&s;e, if the Church has a Bi&s;hop here, he can "immediately &s;u&s;pend a &s;candalous Clergyman". And might not a Commi&s;&s;ary do the &s;ame as well? And yet, this is all within the reach of a Bi&s;hop's power, in con&s;i&s;tency with the Church's con&s;titu|tion. For, as to "depriving, &s;ilencing and excom|municating a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;candalous Clergyman, the Bi&s;hop can do neither of them, before TRYAL of the ca&s;e in &s;ome SPIRITUAL COURT; in con&s;e|quence of which, the Clergyman may be acquitted, and his &s;u&s;pen&s;ion taken off, even in oppo&s;ition to the remon&s;trance of the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf. As to "direction, encouragement, patronage, and refor|mation, by being under the eye of the Bi&s;hop", they do not belong to the affair of "&s;trict di&s;cipline"; &s;o that however u&s;eful a Bi&s;hop might be in the&s;e re&s;pects, it is nothing to the purpo&s;e in that view of the argument it was propo&s;ed to be here con&s;idered. The Public will now judge be|tween us.</P>
<P>THE Dr. proceeds to the affair of <HI>ordination,</HI> the want of which, he &s;ays, is "a greater di&s;advantage,
<PB N="81" REF="010853_0080_0F8523122CB4ABF0">
if po&s;&s;ible, than the want of a regular Government". And why? For the following rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>ONE is, "the danger of cro&s;&s;ing the Atlantic, without which none can be admitted to holy orders". And the danger, in this re&s;pect, he re|pre&s;ents, "however trifling in it's appearance to &s;ome" to have been &s;o formidable "in the appre|hen&s;ion of others, that it has deter'd them from attempting to obtain ordination". He then tells us, "the voyage has proved fatal to near a fifth part of tho&s;e who have gone for holy orders". I have never heard of more than two to whom the &s;ea proved fatal. If eight more lo&s;t their lives by &s;ickne&s;s, it is no more than they might have done if they had tarried at home. But be the "danger" great or &s;mall, there is good rea&s;on to believe, the going to England for ordination is rather an ad|vantage, than di&s;advantage to the Church in regard of it's being &s;upplied with mini&s;ters. As to my &s;elf, I &s;hould e&s;teem it a happy circum&s;tance in the ca&s;e, was I inclined to take orders; and many I have mentioned it to have declared them&s;elves to be of the &s;ame mind. And, were it proper, I could name &s;ome Candidates for the mini&s;try a|mong us, who have been tempted, by profe&s;&s;ors of the Church to receive Epi&s;copal ordination, with this motive in &s;pecial, that they would have a FINE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE ENGLAND. It &s;hould &s;eem from hence, as though going home for orders may be con&s;idered by Epi&s;copalians, either as an advantage, or di&s;advantage, according to the turn they have in view to &s;erve for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>ANOTHER rea&s;on is, "the expence of the voyage, which cannot be reckoned at le&s;s, upon
<PB N="82" REF="010853_0081_0F852313197A1840">
an average, than one hundred pounds &s;terling to each per&s;on", And this is aggravated by the con|&s;ideration, that "the expence mu&s;t generally fall upon &s;uch, as, having already expended the greate&s;t part of their pittance in their education, will find it extremely hard to rai&s;e a &s;ufficient &s;um for the purpo&s;e". I candidly &s;uppo&s;e the Dr. had never &s;een, or, if he had, did not remember at the time of writing, the account of the Society, publi&s;hed in 1706, in which they &s;ay, pag. 74. "all young Students in tho&s;e parts (meaning the Colonies) who de&s;ire Epi&s;copal ordination, are invited into England; and their EXPENCES in coming and re|turning are to be defrayed by the Society". Ac|cording to this invitation, there is no hard&s;hip, as to the article of "expence", that can be complain|ed of, unle&s;s ab&s;urdly, but by the Society them|&s;elves; and they can have ju&s;t rea&s;on for com|plaint, as the money they expend in this way is as properly be&s;towed, as in &s;upport of the Mi&s;|&s;ionaries them&s;elves.</P>
<P>A FARTHER rea&s;on is, that, "under the&s;e di&s;|couragements, there has always been great diffi|culty in &s;upplying the Church with Clergy-men, and there always mu&s;t be". Several in&s;tances are mentioned in illu&s;tration of this, taken from Pen|&s;ylvania, New-Jer&s;ey, and North-Carolina", where, as "Governor Dobbs informed the Society, in 1764, there were but &s;ix Clergymen, though there were twenty-nine Pari&s;hes, and each Pari&s;h con|tained a whole County". The Dr. very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, "other rea&s;ons may have contributed to this want of Clergymen"; but it is really &s;trange he &s;hould &s;ay, "it has always been principally ow|ing to the great difficulty of obtaining ordination".
<PB N="83" REF="010853_0082_0F8523134670ED00">
If this has been &s;o "great a difficulty", how comes it to pa&s;s, that the New England-Colonies have all along been, and now are, &s;upplied with Mi&s;&s;ion|aries; in&s;omuch, that there are few, if any Chur|ches, but are provided with them? Why &s;hould the difficulty be &s;o very great in other Provinces, and none at all in the New-England ones, or &s;o incon|&s;iderable as to be ea&s;ily got over? If it was in it|&s;elf a real and great difficulty, it's operation would be as powerful in the&s;e Colonies, as the other. Other cau&s;es mu&s;t certainly be &s;ought for, in order to account for, this want of a &s;upply of mini&s;ters. And it is ea&s;ie to point them out; more e&s;pecially in regard of "North-Carolina", which is far more &s;paringly provided for, than either Pen&s;ylvania, or New-Jer&s;ey.&mdash;The Society has comparatively neg|lected this Colony, though it's circum&s;tances mo&s;t importunately called for their pious and charitable care, being de&s;titute of the means of &s;alvation in a degree that was never known in the more northern parts of America. The&s;e, though in as full enjoy|ment of the wor&s;hip of God, and the in&s;tituted means of grace, in all their towns and villages, as the people in England, have yet been partakers of the Society's charity in &s;uch large mea&s;ures as to incapacitate them from giving &s;o full a &s;upply of Clergymen to the other Colonies, as perhaps they might have been willing to have done. The view indeed of the Society has been to epi&s;copize the&s;e Colonies, and this they have made their great bu&s;ine&s;s; in&s;omuch, that &s;hould it be accompli&s;hed, IT WILL THEN HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO THE HAPPY ISSUE INTENDED, as we are told, in plain words, by the Bi&s;hop of Landaff, in his Society-&s;ermon February 1767. The Society's capacity of &s;upporting Mi&s;&s;ionaries is not inexhau&s;table;
<PB N="84" REF="010853_0083_0F852313E9CFC7F8">
upon which account, it is no wonder they cannot provide for &s;uch numbers in the more northern Colonies, and &s;end a needful &s;upply al&s;o to the &s;outhern ones. This, I believe, is, at bottom, the chief rea&s;on of the want of Mi&s;&s;ionaries in the places complained of&mdash;Another rea&s;on may be, the want of care in the Church-people to educate their &s;ons for the mini&s;try, owing, I &s;uppo&s;e, to their appre|hending they would not, in this way, be &s;o well provided for, as they &s;hould de&s;ire.&mdash;Another rea|&s;on &s;till may be, the in&s;ufficiency of the temptation, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, to influence Candidates among us to go over to the Church. They have a better pro&s;|pect in continuing with us, than they would have &s;hould they change &s;ides, and become Epi&s;copali|ans.&mdash;I &s;hall only add, I never heard the difficulty of obtaining ordination given as a rea&s;on again&s;t going for it, by any one in this part of America. And I am per&s;uaded, it is now mentioned chiefly in a &s;peculative way, as carrying with it a plau&s;ible ap|pearance to tho&s;e who are &s;trangers to the Country.</P>
<P>IT is farther mentioned, as a "more glaring di&s;|advantage, that it is impo&s;&s;ible a Bi&s;hop, re&s;iding in England, &s;hould be &s;ufficiently acquainted with the characters of tho&s;e who go home from this Country for holy orders". And to this cau&s;e it is attributed, "that ordination has been &s;ometimes fraudulently and &s;urreptitiou&s;ly obtained by &s;uch wretches, as are not only a &s;candal to the Church, but a di&s;grace to the human &s;pecies". It is &s;aid, notwith&s;tanding the <Q>greate&s;t care and circum|&s;pection have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively been exerci&s;ed by the Bi&s;hops of London, in&s;tances have happened, wherein per&s;ons have produced in England ample written Credentials of their pious and orderly
<PB N="85" REF="010853_0084_0F852314CFCE3038">
conver&s;ation, who&s;e lives have been notoriou&s;ly infamous in this Country; and after having been inve&s;ted with the &s;acred office, they have been &s;ent back to take the charge of the &s;ouls of others, in pro&s;ecution of which work, they have acted as if they had not, or imagined that they had not, any &s;ouls of their own.</Q> Had &s;uch a charge been publicly exhibited again&s;t the Society's Mi&s;&s;ionaries by tho&s;e of the Pre&s;byterian or Congregational per|fu&s;ion, it would, however re&s;pectable they might be for their virtuous integrity, have been diregarded at home, and e&s;teemed by Epi&s;copalians here a &s;ure argument of inveterate enmity to the Church. But they can them&s;elves freely &s;ay that, which, if others had only &s;ugge&s;ted, they would have bitterly ex|claimed again&s;t them. There may have been Mi&s;|&s;ionaries, who&s;e character is here ju&s;tly de&s;cribed; but, I believe, it would be found, upon examination, that they were natives of England or Ireland, and &s;ent from home, from whence they mu&s;t have had their ample Credentials, if they had any, and not from this Country. I know of none, who have gone from America, at lea&s;t this part of it, to whom the above de&s;cription can be ju&s;tly applicable; nor am I, at pre&s;ent, inclined to think, it is &s;trictly true in regard of any of them.</P>
<P>IN order to give the matter a &s;till more plau&s;ible appearance, it is &s;aid, "in &s;uch a Country as Ame|rica, an artful man may &s;ometimes be able to pro|cure te&s;timonials in his favor, &s;igned by a compe|tent number of &s;uch CLERGYMEN and others as a Bi&s;hop of London will not know how to object a|gain&s;t". What there is in "&s;uch a Country as this", more than in other Countries, to favor a wicked art|ful man in procuring &s;uch te&s;timonials of his pious
<PB N="86" REF="010853_0085_0F85231567D762F8">
and regular life as "a Bi&s;hop of London would not object again&s;t", the Dr. has not pointed out, and I am utterly at a lo&s;s to know his meaning here; but it is ea&s;ie to know thus much, that he has &s;hamefully reflected on the Epi&s;copal-Clergy, by &s;aying, that this artful man, who&s;e life had been notoriou&s;ly infamous in this Country, might be able to get a "competent number of them" to &s;ign te&s;timonials of his chri&s;tian good conver&s;ation.&mdash;Nay, he makes his artful &s;eeker of orders infamous to &s;o high a degree of guilt, as even to FORGE te&s;timonials in his own favor. And to this he at|tributes "the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;ome adventurers from the Colonies, who have obtained ordination, and then returned to America to di&s;grace them&s;elves, and the Church". It is &s;trange to &s;ee, when men have an end in view their heart is &s;et upon, what lengths they will go in &s;aying tho&s;e things, which, if &s;aid by others, would be attributed to the powerful in|fluence of imbittered hatred and malice. The Dr. has painted the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, &s;ome of them a lea&s;t, in the blacke&s;t colors. They were never viewed, by the wor&s;t enemies the Church ever had, in a light &s;o glaringly bad. It is very much doubted, even by the&s;e, whether an in&s;tance can be given of a &s;ingle per&s;on, &s;o infamou&s;ly vile, as to go from America with FORGED CREDNETIALS, in order to obtain ordination. One there was who came from England with a FORGED LICENCE to preach; and he was as notorious a &s;inner as ever prophaned a pulpit; but we never heard, in this part of the world, of any one who <HI>forged</HI> Credentials from hence to come over with orders to officiate as a mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>BUT if it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the whole of what is here &s;aid is exactly and literally true, might
<PB N="87" REF="010853_0086_0F852318E3631500">
not the ca&s;e be the &s;ame was there a Bi&s;hop in America? The greater part by far of tho&s;e who would go to him for orders, would be as unknown to him, by rea&s;on of their great di&s;tance from his &s;eat, as to a Bi&s;hop in England. He mu&s;t there|fore depend upon te&s;timonials from others, and the&s;e might be <HI>forged,</HI> or <HI>procured no one knows how;</HI> and there would be little le&s;s danger of it than there is now. It is certain, many notoriou&s;ly wicked per&s;ons in England, va&s;tly more in pro|portion than in America, have found ways, by <HI>forging</HI> te&s;timonials, or by procuring them, to u&s;e the Dr's phra&s;e, "God knows how", to get into holy orders; and this, though they are much near|er the ordaining Bi&s;hop, than mo&s;t of tho&s;e can be, in the Colonies, who may want, and go from them. And the like legerdemain might as ea&s;ily be pract|i&s;ed here as there. I know of nothing, if it be &s;uppo&s;ed that men are abandoned to all &s;en&s;e of God and religion, to hinder it. Be&s;ides, Com|mi&s;&s;aries might as well prevent this mi&s;chief as Bi&s;hops, &s;o far as it can be prevented. And a Bi&s;hop of London would be no more in danger of being impo&s;ed upon by &s;uch infamous wretches, than a Bi&s;hop in America, if he would give orders to none but &s;uch as came recommended by a Com|mi&s;&s;ary. In this ca&s;e, one mu&s;t be a fool, or mad|man, &s;hould he forge te&s;timonials under his name; becau&s;e he would immediately be detected upon his returning hither.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the Dr. appears to have been as deficient in his arguing upon the head of ordi|nation, as di&s;cipline. He does not pretend, in his rea&s;oning, that the Church will be deprived of the benefit of ordination, &s;hould there be no Bi&s;hop
<PB N="88" REF="010853_0087_0F8523190593BFE8">
in the Colonies. All he goes upon is the "danger and expence" that attend the obtainment of it; and that the Epi&s;copal Churches would be in greater danger of having vicious Clergymen ob|truded on them. Enough, I tru&s;t, has been &s;aid to &s;hew, that the&s;e are pretences, rather plau&s;ible in appearance, than carrying with them real and great weight.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hould the whole of what the Dr. has offered be allowed it's full force, without the lea&s;t abate|ment, there is no other hard&s;hip, or difficulty, in the ca&s;e, than what naturally re&s;ults from pro|fe&s;&s;ed principles, and mu&s;t unavoidably follow up|on them, unle&s;s an e&s;tabli&s;hment is purpo&s;ely made in their favor. The only proper que&s;tion therefore is, whether &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the acknowledged &s;upreme head of the Church of England, e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the American Colonies, may be thought wi&s;e, expedient, or politic? It appears to us &s;uch incon|veniences, or rather mi&s;chiefs, will be the atten|dants on it, as to make it no ways proper or fit. What the&s;e are &s;hall, in it's due place, be particularly mentioned as &s;o many rea&s;ons or objections again&s;t an American Epi&s;copate.</P>

<HEAD>ANSWER to SECTION IV. in which the unparalleled Hard&s;hip of this Ca&s;e is repre|&s;ented.</HEAD>
<P>THE Dr. &s;eems to think, that he has here a mo&s;t "fruitful &s;ubject for declamation"; though he declines to "proceed in this way", and has it in de&s;ign to "&s;tate arguments and facts for the con&s;ideration of the Public". If he had kept this de&s;ign &s;teadily in view, he would have given us le&s;s declamation, and more rea&s;oning that was &s;olid.</P>
<P>HE begins with "making an appeal to the con|&s;ciences of men in behalf of the Church". And here, if he had fairly "&s;tated the fact", he might ea&s;ily have known, the que&s;tion he puts could not have been an&s;wered in his favor, upon an impar|tial, thorow attention to it. The fact placed in it's true point of light is this. The greater part by far of the Epi&s;copal-Churches, in tho&s;e va&s;tly ex|tended, and well inhabited, parts of America, reach|ing from Pen&s;ylvania &s;outhward, to Nova-Scotia northward, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts chiefly upon the pious help of the Society at home, at the expence, it may be, of three thou&s;and pounds &s;terling per annum;&mdash;they cannot have &s;uch Bi&s;hops placed at their head as
<PB N="90" REF="010853_0089_0F852319EB79E9D0">
they would de&s;ire, at a much le&s;s additional annual expence of pious charity;&mdash;and, lea&s;t going to England for ordination by a Bi&s;hop, conformably to Epi&s;copalian-principles, &s;hould be di&s;couraging, as it would be attended with charge, the Society has publicly invited into England all young Stu|dents in the&s;e parts, who de&s;ire holy orders; de|claring, THAT THEIR EXPENCE IN COMING AND RETURNING IS TO BE DEFRAYED BY THE SO|CIETY. This is the fact ju&s;tly &s;tated; and, in this view of it, I believe, no denomination of chri&s;tians, under like circum&s;tances, in his Maje&s;ty's domini|ons, or in any part of the earth, would think them|&s;elves in the lea&s;t injured on account of the <HI>expence</HI> attending the obtainment of ordination. In&s;tead of crying out "per&s;ecution! intolerable griev|ance"! they would rather, if they had a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of obligation, feel the bonds of gratitude, and ac|knowledge they were kindly dealt with. There could be no room, in this ca&s;e, to lament the ima|ginary hard&s;hip of "not being allowed a Clergy|man without paying a fine of an hundred pounds &s;terling on his admi&s;&s;ion to orders". And as to "the dangerous proce&s;s that has proved fatal to a fifth part" of tho&s;e who have entered upon it, it is really &s;trange the Dr. &s;hould again bring it to view. It is no other than that common danger which thou&s;ands voluntarily expo&s;e them&s;elves to, tho' they have nothing more in pro&s;pect, than the plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing foreign Countries. Be&s;ides, this was much more than an ordinary fatality; and may not happen again for hundreds of years. Surely, the Dr. mu&s;t needs be at a lo&s;s for &s;omething weighty to &s;ay, or he would not have &s;o enlarged upon this comparative trifle, and painted it in &s;uch hideous colors. And, notwith&s;tanding this

<P>THE Dr. in a flu&s;h of zeal, had &s;poken of the nece&s;&s;ity of going home for orders as "per&s;ecu|tion". He &s;eems, upon being a little more cool, to retract that word, as "the grievance in que&s;tion does not ari&s;e from any po&s;itive exertion of civil power"; but &s;till, it is "&s;omething as bad in it's natural con&s;equences". And, being again &s;udden|ly fired, "que&s;tions, whether the wor&s;t per&s;ecuti|ons ever exterminated a fifth part of the Clergy in any Country"; as if accidental misfortunes, men, in all parts of the world, readily run the hazard of, upon motives far le&s;s important, than tho&s;e go upon who de&s;ire holy orders, might be compa|red to a formal per&s;ecution de&s;igned to extermi|nate a whole Clergy, though it &s;hould take effect upon a fifth part only. The Dr. certainly forgot he intended to argue, or he could not have &s;ub&s;ti|tuted in the room of it, the meer flight of a warm|ed imagination.</P>

<P>He farther &s;peaks of it as "an aggravation of their unhappine&s;s, that it appears to be altogether unprecedented; they being &s;ingled out from all the people upon earth to be made the fir&s;t exam|ple of it".

And what is a much greater grievance &s;till, are they not, by "the po&s;itive exertion of civil power", deprived of their natural rights as men, by not being permitted, while they act conforma|bly to the dictates of their con&s;ciences, to &s;u&s;tain any po&s;t, either of honor or profit, in the kingdom of South-Britain?

Upon the whole, it is highly extravagant, I might rather &s;ay, to a great degree ludicrous, to &s;peak of the Church, in America, as "without a precedent", in point of grievance, &s;hould what has been &s;aid be con&s;idered, in all it's force, without the lea&s;t abatement. But, if viewed in it's proper light, as accompanied with the mitigations, and le&s;&s;enings that have been mentioned, it will appear, if at all a grievance, but a very light one; and &s;o mixt with kindne&s;s as to give occa&s;ion rather for gratitude, than complaint.</P>

THE Dr. having endeavoured to work upon the pa&s;&s;ions of the people, now comes to try his &s;kill upon tho&s;e in power. He begins with claiming it as the right of Epi&s;copalians here to be "con|&s;idered as equal with the foremo&s;t, in every due expre&s;&s;ion of fidelity and loyalty". We won't con|tend with him, while he only makes them "equal", not &s;uperior, to the other denominations of men in the Country; who e&s;teem them&s;elves as &s;trongly bound to fidelity and loyalty to the Briti&s;h Crown, upon the "principles of Chri&s;tianity", as well as from "pre&s;ent intere&s;t and inclination". If he really meant no reflection, when he &s;aid, "no trumpet of &s;edition was ever heard to found from our pulpits&mdash;no words of &s;edition have been &s;uffer|ed more privately to be &s;own in our hou&s;es", as he &s;eems to declare in a marginal note, we will find no fault; though &s;ome are di&s;po&s;ed to think, he would not have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in this manner, unle&s;s he had intended an in&s;inuation, that &s;ome|thing of this nature had been done by others.</P>
<P>HAVING thus proclaimed the extraordinary loy|alty of the Church, he proceeds to the work of ex|po&s;tulation. <Q>If then the Church of England in America is not di&s;tingui&s;hed by the want of duty and affection to the Government, why &s;hould it be thus di&s;tingui&s;hed and &s;tigmatized by the want of tho&s;e religious privileges, which are granted to all other denominations of chri&s;tians whatever, in the Briti&s;h dominions?</Q> Strangers to the real &s;tate of things in the Country would be naturally and obviou&s;ly led, by what is here &s;aid, to imagine, that &s;ome great difference was <HI>po&s;itively</HI> made, by the Government at home, be|twixt Epi&s;copalians in the Colonies, and other de|nominations
<PB N="97" REF="010853_0096_0F85232AD63DB5D8">
of chri&s;tians; favoring the latter, and putting &s;ome "&s;tigmatizing" mark upon the for|mer: Whereas the truth is, they are allowed the &s;ame liberty with all other per&s;ua&s;ions, and do, with as much freedom from mole&s;tation, wor&s;hip God in the preci&s;e way they them&s;elves are plea&s;ed to chu&s;e. All the difference is, our principles do not hamper us with tho&s;e objected difficulties, their's expo&s;e them to. He goes on, "in our petitioning for Bi&s;hops, all that we a&s;k for our &s;elves, is what has been freely granted to others, what has been refu&s;ed to none el&s;e who have applied for it". We know of nothing that has been granted to others, and refu&s;ed to none, but what is equally granted to them, and has never been refu&s;ed. No deno|mination of chri&s;tians in the Colonies ever a&s;ked, or de&s;ired, more than free liberty to &s;erve God con|formably to the dictates of their con&s;ciences; and this liberty the Church enjoys, in common with all others. No; they are not upon an "equal footing" with their neighbours. So it &s;hould &s;eem the Dr. thinks, by what immediately follows. Says he, <Q>we reque&s;t only the liberty of enjoying the in&s;titutions of our Church, and thereby of being put upon an equal footing with our neighbours&mdash;with the various &s;ects of Engli&s;h di&s;&s;enters, who have the full enjoyment of their re&s;pective forms of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical government and di&s;cipline&mdash;and even with the Moravians and Papi&s;ts, who are &s;everally allowed a Bi&s;hop.</Q> It may be perti|nently a&s;ked here, what in&s;titution of the Church is not enjoyed here, &s;ave only confirmation, which the Dr. has thought proper to pa&s;s over, leaving it out of the pre&s;ent debate? As to "di&s;cipline" and "ordination", he does not complain, as in ju&s;tice he could not, of the real want of either;
<PB N="98" REF="010853_0097_0F85232B94160760">
but the only complaint is, that the former is in|complete without a Bi&s;hop, and the latter attended with inconvenience. And is there no difference between NOT ENJOYING AT ALL the&s;e in&s;titutions of the Church, and enjoying them <HI>partially</HI> and with <HI>inconvenience?</HI> Be&s;ides, whence does it ari&s;e, that Epi&s;copalians do not enjoy the in&s;titutions of religion as <HI>fully</HI> and <HI>completely</HI> as the other denomi|nations of chri&s;tians? Can it, with the lea&s;t appear|ance of rea&s;on, be a&s;cribed to any peculiar favor the government has &s;hewn to the&s;e denominations, to the exclu&s;ion of them? Far from it. It is the natural re&s;ult from their own principles, and not at all owing to any di&s;tinction that has been made between them and other chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>IT will, perhaps, be &s;aid here, if, according to the principles they profe&s;s, they cannot <HI>fully</HI> enjoy the in&s;titutions of the Engli&s;h Church without a Bi&s;hop at their head, why &s;hould they be denied one? I an&s;wer, for rea&s;ons that &s;hall hereafter be mentioned, which, I would hope, will be thought &s;ufficient by indifferent judges. In the mean time, I would only &s;ay, if the KING, who is acknowledg|ed by Epi&s;copalians to be the head of the Church in America, as well as England, does not &s;ee fit, in his great wi&s;dom, to favor them beyond any other of his &s;ubjects in the Colonies, as he mu&s;t do by &s;ending them Bi&s;hops, which, though &s;piritual offi|cers, are yet greatly expen&s;ive ones, why &s;hould they make &s;uch bitter complaints? It would not argue their being over-mode&s;t, if they e&s;teemed him as good a judge of what was proper to be done in this ca&s;e, as them&s;elves. Po&s;&s;ibly, he may think greater inconveniences would attend the &s;ettlement of an Epi&s;copate, at &s;o great a di&s;tance from him,
<PB N="99" REF="010853_0098_0F85232BE608B1C0">
than tho&s;e that are con&s;equent upon the pre&s;ent want of it.&mdash;Po&s;&s;ibly, he may be apprehen&s;ive, it might prove an occa&s;ion of "bitterne&s;s, envy, anger, wrath, clamor, &s;trife, and evil-&s;peaking", tho&s;e "works of the fle&s;h", which are de&s;tructive of all true religion.&mdash;Po&s;&s;ibly, he may fear &s;ome ill effects relative to the &s;tate.&mdash;But, whatever the rea&s;ons are, which re&s;train his Maje&s;ty from e&s;tabli&s;hing Bi&s;hops in America, his wi&s;e plea&s;ure &s;hould cer|tainly make them ea&s;ie; e&s;pecially, as they own him to be the &s;upreme Governor of the Church.</P>
<P>IN aggravation of the Church's "unprecedented" hard&s;hip, the Dr. goes on to &s;ay, in "apo&s;tolic times", care was taken to form chri&s;tians, as they increa&s;ed, into "proper Eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;tricts, and to appoint Bi&s;hops for each". If he means, that, as "the number of di&s;ciples was multiplied", they were "added to the Churches" in the&s;e and tho&s;e places, which had pa&s;tors at their head; or were formed into new Churches with pa&s;tors over them, this is very true: And we heartily wi&s;h, that all the Churches in America had &s;uch Pa&s;tors, or Bi|&s;hops. But if he intends, that chri&s;tians were&punc; in tho&s;e days, "formed into di&s;tricts with Bi&s;hops over them", in any mea&s;ure conformable to the manner of the Church of England, or that which is intended for the Church in America, he is gro&s;ly mi&s;taken. There were then no &s;uch di&s;tricts or Bi&s;hops. And if we pur&s;ue the hi&s;tory of the Church, through the times that may, with any propriety, be called truly primitive, we &s;hall meet with no in&s;tance of this kind; nor can an in&s;tance be produced, until there had "come a falling a|way fir&s;t", and that "man of &s;in" began to be "re|vealed", who hath oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to all that is
<PB N="100" REF="010853_0099_0F8DE4BDDAA37540">
called God, or that is wor&s;hipped; &s;o that he, as God, has &s;et in the temple of God, &s;hewing that he was him&s;elf God".</P>
<P>THE Dr. by recuring to the "records of Pa|gani&s;m and Mahometani&s;m", to magnifie the neg|lect of the Church in America by his &s;uperiors in England, is both ungrateful and unrea&s;onable.&mdash;He is ungrateful, as they have for more than &s;ixty years been expre&s;&s;ing their pious regards to it, by expending, at the lowe&s;t computation, thirty thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling to promote it's growth. And he is as unrea&s;onable, in that, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;covery of &s;o much concern for the Church in the Colonies, he would make them even wor&s;e than "Pagans", or "Mahometans", becau&s;e they do not gratifie his fond de&s;ires in e&s;tabli&s;hing an Epi&s;copate here, after the mode of the Church at home. Let me take this opportunity to remind the Dr. once for all, that, as it lies with the KING, whether they &s;hall, or &s;hall not, have Bi&s;hops in America, all his complaints finally terminate on him: For this rea&s;on, I could wi&s;h he had ex|pre&s;&s;ed more dutiful reverence towards his Sove|reign, than to charge him, as he does virtually, and in reality of con&s;truction, with treating the Church here with "UNPARALLELED HARDSHIP; PER|SECUTION, or what is AS BAD IN IT'S CONSE|QUENCES; yea, with NEGLECT SO GRIEVOUS as not to be PRECEDENTED", either by PAGANS, or MAHOMETANS. It is hoped, the Clergy of the Church of England, in their addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, have &s;poken to him with more decency, and be|coming reverence.</P>

<HEAD>ANSWER to SECTION V. a&s;&s;igning Rea|&s;ons why the Church in America has been thus neglected.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Section would have been wholly pa&s;&s;ed over, as we have no concern with the more immediate contents of it, but that the Dr. has, here and there, mixt with his rea&s;ons, why the Church has been &s;o greatly neglected, &s;ome mat|ters of intelligence it may be fit to take into con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t I would mention is thus expre&s;&s;ed, "the propriety of &s;ending a Bi&s;hop to the&s;e Colo|nies", that is, the Colonies that were &s;ettled by tho&s;e who had an aver&s;ion to Epi&s;copal govern|ment, "will be di&s;puted by none". This is no|thing more than a rattle to plea&s;e children with. If a Bi&s;hop is &s;ent, will he have nothing to do in the&s;e Colonies? Will they not be part of his Dio|ce&s;s? Will not the Epi&s;copal-Churches in them, at lea&s;t their Clergy, be under his in&s;pection and government? All that can be meant, by the "ac|knowledged impropriety" of &s;ending a Bi&s;hop to the&s;e Colonies, is only this, that it may not be proper he &s;hould, at pre&s;ent, have his &s;eat here. But &s;till, he will be as completely &s;ettled at the
<PB N="102" REF="010853_0101_0F85223CDABFEE50">
head of the Epi&s;copal Clergy, within the&s;e bounds, as in the other Colonies; and will have the &s;ame right of &s;uper-intending and governing them. So that, if his place of re&s;idence &s;hould not be here, his power will; and it will be the &s;ame, in all it's exerci&s;es, as in any of the other Provinces: Nor are we &s;o de&s;titute of fore&s;ight as not to &s;ee, that it will be thought as "proper", a Bi&s;hop &s;hould have his <HI>&s;eat</HI> in the&s;e Colonies, as in any of the o|ther, whenever a fit opportunity, with promi&s;ing circum&s;tances, &s;hall pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>ANOTHER piece of intelligence we are let into is, that however "negligent" and "&s;tupid" the Epi&s;copalians here have been, about the affair of an Epi&s;copate in America, it has engaged the at|tention of their &s;uperiors at home for more than &s;ixty years. "The worthy Society, to whom the nation, and the chri&s;tian world in general, are un|der great obligations, and to who&s;e unexampled liberality, indefatigable application, and amazing per&s;everance, the Church of England owes it's VERY EXISTENCE, at this day, in SOME OF THE COLONIES"; I &s;ay, this Society in particular has mo&s;t heartily and vigorou&s;ly employed it's pains in pro&s;ecution of this good work, by "making all proper repre&s;entations of the ca&s;e to Queen Ann in her day"; by "purcha&s;ing a hou&s;e in New-Jer&s;ey, for the re&s;idence of a Bi&s;hop" &s;ome time after; by "obtaining an order from the Crown for a bill to be drawn, and laid before the Parlia|ment for e&s;tabli&s;hing an American Epi&s;copate; by attempting the &s;ame thing, with the &s;ame &s;pirit, the next reign, and with an encouraging pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s": And the "venerable Patrons and Supporters of the Church in America", this &s;ame
<PB N="103" REF="010853_0102_0F85223D8BBF4360">
worthy Society, "have continued to keep &s;ight of this great object, and have been WATCHING FOR SEASONABLE OPPORTUNITIES OF EXERTING THEMSELVES TO OBTAIN IT". Who now can be at a lo&s;s to know the true rea&s;on of the appli|cation of &s;uch va&s;t &s;ums of money, in tho&s;e Colo|nies that &s;tood in little or no need of &s;uch pious charity! Who can help yielding the full a&s;&s;ent of his mind to this affirmed truth; that it is, in the opinion of Epi&s;copalians here, and their &s;uperiors at home, an "indi&s;puted impropriety" to fix a Bi&s;hop in the New-England Colonies, &s;hould the way be duly prepared for it!</P>
<P>I SHALL here add to the intelligence the Dr. has given us, that there never was a time, &s;ince the incorporation of the Society for the propagation of the Go&s;pel, wherein &s;uch earne&s;t and vigorous efforts were made, both in the Colonies and in England, to obtain the long wi&s;hed-for ble&s;&s;ing, an American-Epi&s;copate. No pains have been wanting, no methods left untried, in order to bring this into event. The whole Clergy of the Church of England here are united in their endeavours; and, without all doubt, have been &s;pirited hereto by in&s;tructions from tho&s;e, in high dignity at home, who have promi&s;ed their influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in an affair of &s;o great importance. Surely the Dr. had no need to have taken up &s;o much of the preceding &s;ection, in fetching arguments from the apo&s;tolic, and &s;ucceeding times; yea, from the records of "Pagani&s;m" and "Mahometani&s;m", to excite in &s;uperiors there compa&s;&s;ion towards the poor American Church, in it's "deplorable wretch|ed condition"; or rather to &s;hame them for their neglect in taking &s;o little care of it's intere&s;t.

there never was a Church, in any chri&s;tian Colony, in any part of the earth, that has had more done for it, or that has been the object of a more &s;ollicitous concern in the minds of better friends, and more able Patrons. It mu&s;t not be e&s;teemed a matter of wonder, if we are &s;o far alarmed, as to con&s;ider, and &s;peak freely upon &s;o intere&s;ting an occa&s;ion.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE la&s;t article of intelligence relates to the ex|ternal circum&s;tances of the Bi&s;hop that is de&s;ired to be &s;ent to America. "A &s;eat has been pur|cha&s;ed for his re&s;idence, at &s;ix hundred pounds &s;terling expence, in a convenient Man&s;ion-hou&s;e and lands, &s;ituate at Burlington in the Jer&s;eys". And, as the Dr. declares el&s;ewhere, pag. 108. <Q>a fund has been e&s;tabli&s;hed for this particular purpo&s;e, (the &s;upport of a Bi&s;hop) for more than half a Century pa&s;t; and many worthy per&s;ons have contributed generou&s;ly and largely to the in|crea&s;e of it. Says he, I can recollect, as I am writing, the following in&s;tances: Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Tenni&s;on,</HI> who has been dead upwards of fifty years, bequeathed to it one THOUSAND POUNDS &s;terling; Sir <HI>Jonathan Trelawners,</HI> near the &s;ame time, another THOUSAND POUNDS; the Lady <HI>Elizabeth Ha&s;tings,</HI> FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS; Bi&s;hop <HI>Butler,</HI> FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS; Bi&s;hop <HI>Ben&s;on,</HI> TWO HUNDRED POUNDS; Bi&s;hop <HI>O&s;|balda&s;ton,</HI> FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS; and Mr. <HI>Fi&s;her,</HI> ONE THOUSAND POUNDS. The&s;e, and all other &s;ums, which the Society have received for this u&s;e, were put into the public funds as &s;oon as paid into their hands, and have been ac|cumulating ever &s;ince, excepting what they ex|pended at Burlington. If this &s;tock is not

&s;ufficient for the &s;upport of a proper Epi&s;copate in America, I imagine the difficulty of making it &s;ufficient will not be great. For, as many have given liberally on the <HI>remote pro&s;pect</HI> of it's be|ing needed, it is not to be doubted but bene|factors will be rai&s;ed up, when a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hall be called for by a <HI>pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IT is unque&s;tionable, from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, if a Bi&s;hop is &s;ent to America, that &s;uch provi&s;ion mu&s;t be made for his &s;upport, as will enable him to ap|pear in all the grandeur of a Bi&s;hop in England. His place of re&s;idence, and manner of living, mu&s;t exceed a common Clergyman's in proportion to his much more exalted &s;tation in the Church. Such Bi|&s;hops were unknown in the chri&s;tian world, in it's fir&s;t days of purity: Nor do we read of them, until chri&s;tians had gro&s;ly departed from that &s;im|plicity in living, which was their primitive glory. At &s;o great a di&s;tance from apo&s;tolic times as the third Century, though corruption had then crept into the Church, Paul of Samo&s;ata, Bi&s;hop of An|tioch, and one of Cyprian's contemporaries, was depo&s;ed, among other things, for this, "that, hav|ing been poor before he was Bi&s;hop, he had after that grown very rich, born &s;ecular dignities, pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treets with a train of attendants, and erected to him&s;elf a magnificent &s;eat in the Church".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;eb. Lib. 7. Cap. 30.</NOTE> Nay, a good while after this, though the Church had grown &s;till more corrupt, the fourth council of Carthage decreed, "that the Bi&s;hop &s;hall have a little dwelling-hou&s;e near the Church; that he &s;hall have but cour&s;e hou&s;hold-&s;tuff and diet, and &s;eek his reputation only by &s;ound doctrine, and a good life; that he &s;hall not &s;pend his time in caring for

But I would, that I, and all my brethren the Bi&s;hops, would leave all our &s;tiles, and write the &s;tile of our offices, calling our&s;elves <HI>the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t:</HI> So that we took not upon us the name vainly, but were &s;o even in deed. So that we might order our Dioce&s;s in &s;uch fort, that neither paper, parch|ment, lead or wax, but the very chri&s;tian conver|&s;ation might be the letters &amp; &s;eals of our offices; as the Corinthians were to Paul, to whom he &s;aid, ye are the letters and &s;eals of our Apo&s;tle&s;hip<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pierce's Vind.

If the fourth part of the Bi&s;hoprick remained unto the Bi&s;hop, it were &s;ufficient; the third part to &s;uch as &s;hould teach good learning; the &s;econd part to the poor of the Dioce&s;s; and the other to maintain men of war for the &s;afe|guard of the common-wealth, it were better be|&s;towed a great deal.

Men are too ready, if they are much rai&s;ed above others in worldly circum&s;tances, to grow big in their own ap|prehen&s;ions, to be haughty and imperious; treating tho&s;e below them with in&s;olence and comtempt. They are too apt to &s;et their hearts "upon that which is not"; to live high, keeping &s;umptuous tables; to &s;pend their time in ea&s;e and indolence, to the di&s;&s;ipation of their minds, and unfitting them for tho&s;e &s;piritual exerci&s;es, without which they will have little reli&s;h for the things of God and religion. And, perhaps, this has been as common among the Clergy, as any other order of men; not excepting Bi&s;hops them&s;elves. The excellent Bi&s;hop Burnet, &s;en&s;ible of this, in an addre&s;s to his brethren, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the Epi&s;copal office, thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, <Q>I wi&s;h the pomp of living, and the keep|ing high tables, could be quite taken away. It is a great charge, and no very decent one; a great devourer of time, and will make you look too like the men of the world.

I had not &s;trength enough to break through that, which cu&s;tom has impo&s;ed on tho&s;e provided with plentiful Bi&s;hopricks.

and poverty are both extremes, neither of which &s;eem &s;utable for Clergy-men. "Conveniency of food and raiment" for them, and their families, is rather de&s;irable. More than this; to be &s;ure, an abundance of the world will be dangerous to them, and greatly hurtful to the Church of God. This is a truth in fact, and known to be &s;o. Chri&s;tia|nity never &s;uffered &s;o much by all it's per&s;ecutions by Pagan-powers, as by the pomp and grandeur of the Clergy, e&s;pecially of &s;uperior orders. The riches of the Church, under the Patronage of tho&s;e Princes of the earth who were called it's "nur&s;ing fathers", have been it's ruin, by being the occa&s;ion, through abu&s;e, of tho&s;e numerous abominations, which have mo&s;t &s;hamefully defiled the temple of God.

<HEAD>ANSWER to SECTION VI. which &s;ays the pre&s;ent Juncture is apprehended to be favorable to the Epi&s;copate in que&s;tion.</HEAD>
<P>THE Dr. here &s;peaks of it as "the opinion of many wi&s;e and judicious per&s;ons, that the favourable opportunity", for e&s;tabli&s;hing an Ame|rican Epi&s;copate, "now pre&s;ents it&s;elf"; an op|portunity, which "the circum&s;tances of the nation have never, until now, afforded". But, what are the&s;e circum&s;tances, which make the pre&s;ent, &s;o favourable an opportunity? "The tumults of war have cea&s;ed, and the public tranquility re&s;tored, without any rea&s;onable &s;u&s;picion of a &s;peedy inter|ruption". Was this never the ca&s;e before, and within the memory of the Dr. him&s;elf? If he will only reflect a little, he may bring to mind a time, &s;ince he became capable of noticing facts, when "the circum&s;tances of the nation" were &s;o very like to the&s;e, that he will not find it an ea&s;ie mat|ter to point out the difference. And are there "no rea&s;onable &s;u&s;picions of a &s;peedy interruption of the pre&s;ent tranquility"? He herein appears a &s;tranger, not only to the known di&s;po&s;ition, and pa&s;t conduct, of both France and Spain towards England, but to what they have been doing ever &s;ince the conclu&s;ion of the late war to &s;trengthen
<PB N="110" REF="010853_0109_0F85224D24BE8268">
their naval force, and put them&s;elves in a capacity to break the pre&s;ent peace.&mdash;Again, "the greate&s;t harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between our Mother-country, and mo&s;t of the Colonies; the late di&s;pute having been brought to a happy termination". It is true, the di&s;pute, relative to the STAMP-ACT, has been hap|pily terminated. But has nothing intervened &s;ince, that has di&s;turbed the harmony between the Mo|ther-country, and the Colonies? Are "mo&s;t of the Colonies" quite &s;atisfied with the doings at home, brought into effect with reference to them? One would think, by the repre&s;entation here made of them, that the Dr. had been &s;hut up from the world, and knew not what was pa&s;&s;ing in it. There is nothing more certain, than that "mo&s;t of the Colonies" think them&s;elves as nearly touched in their CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS by the late Par|liamentary proceeding, as by the STAMP-ACT it|&s;elf; and they are every day groaning out their complaints; though they are re&s;olved to do it in tho&s;e ways that are <HI>legal.</HI> It is &s;trange, that pre|judice it&s;elf, though &s;peaking to promote a favour|ite-point, &s;hould publicly &s;ay, that "the greate&s;t harmony now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Mother-country, and mo&s;t of the Colonies". No fact re|lated for truth was ever more di&s;tant from it&mdash;Farther, "the plan of an American-Epi&s;copate has been &s;ettled, and adju&s;ted in &s;uch manner, that the religious privileges of none can be violated, or endangered". By whom has this plan been &s;ettled and adju&s;ted? We have no good rea&s;on to think, that it has been done by tho&s;e, who have any con|&s;titutional-right to meddle, of their own meer mo|tion, with matters of this nature; and we &s;hall &s;ee, in proper time, that, if it has been &s;ettled, it is not &s;o adju&s;ted, but that the privileges, even of
<PB N="111" REF="010853_0110_0F85224DEC312BE0">
Epi&s;copalians, will be violated by it.&mdash;As to what follows, relating to "the happine&s;s of having a Prince upon the throne, who is unque&s;tionably di&s;po&s;ed to promote the general intere&s;t of virtue and religion", the other denominations are as thankful as the Epi&s;copalians can be; but do not look upon this an argument more favoring their cau&s;e than our's. We can chearfully rely on the impartial ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of the Briti&s;h Sove|reign, not in the lea&s;t doubting his equal paternal regard to all his loyal Coloni&s;ts of whatever cla&s;s. We know not what "declarations he has made on the &s;ubject of an American-Epi&s;copate"; but this we have abundant rea&s;on to believe, that he will do nothing in this matter, but what is wi&s;ely and kindly fitted to promote the real good of his &s;ub|jects here, not con&s;idered &s;eparately, but in one collective view; which is all we de&s;ire.&mdash;The&s;e now are "the advantages," which, as the Dr. &s;ays, "peculiarly mark the pre&s;ent period." But they all, excepting the la&s;t, which is as favourable to us as them, may be ju&s;tly looked upon as real di&s;ad|vantages, pointing out the pre&s;ent, as the mo&s;t in|convenient juncture that could be pitched upon, for the accompli&s;hment of the great thing de&s;ired.</P>
<P>THE Dr. now goes on to "other arguments for &s;ending Bi&s;hops to America, never &s;o urgent and forcible as at pre&s;ent".</P>
<P>ONE is, the "great increa&s;e" of profe&s;&s;ors of the Church. "In the former part of this Century, they were &s;mall and incon&s;iderable in compari&s;on with the amount of their pre&s;ent num|ber". He is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, "that the Church of England in America contains now near a MILLION
<PB N="112" REF="010853_0111_0F85224EA7B31218">
of members". This is more than once repeated in other parts of his performance; and the like account, we have been informed, has been in&s;erted in the petitions, the Epi&s;copal-Clergy have &s;ent home to be&s;peak the intere&s;t of their &s;uperiors with reference to the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops to the Colonies. It is &s;urpri&s;ing, they &s;hould publi&s;h it to the world, that their Church containts &s;o great a number. They mu&s;t certainly, in order to inhance the ac|count, reckon the NEGROE-SLAVES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Dr. for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf, did not chu&s;e to &s;ay, in plain words, that NEGROES, knowing nothing of religion, make a very large part of his MIL|LION of the "members of the Church of England". But it is evident, he has the&s;e in re&s;erve to &s;ave the truth of his affirmation. He &s;ays, pag. 55, "from ge|neral calculations it has been frequently &s;aid, of late years, that the proper &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h Crown in America amount to <HI>three millions</HI>". And again, pag. 89. "of the inhabitants of this Country a <HI>full third part</HI> belongs to the Church". Now, if there are not, as the Dr. will not pretend that there are, <HI>three million</HI> of inhabitants, or Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, unle&s;s the BLACKS are reckoned, the Church cannot have belonging to it a <HI>third part,</HI> or <HI>one million,</HI> of the&s;e inhabitants, if the blacks are left out of the account. This is more evi|dent &s;till, from what the Dr. &s;ays of the &s;urvey that was made of the number of inhabitants, in 1762. His words are, pag. 55, "It was then found, that they a|mounted to between two and three million in the Co|lonies, and I&s;lands". Of the&s;e, &s;ays the Dr. pag. 57, "The blacks were found to be about eight hundred and forty four thou&s;and". A large deduction then mu&s;t be made from the MILLION profe&s;&s;ors of the Church, if the blacks are not counted. And in truth, the Dr. him&s;elf virtually acknowledges it; though, perhaps, he did not intend the acknowledgment &s;hould be perceived. For he &s;ays, pag. 56, "of the WHITES"; that is in the above-mentioned &s;urvey, which found between two and three Million inhabitants in the Colonies and I&s;lands, "the profe&s;&s;ors of the Church were about a <HI>third part</HI>". So that, according to the Dr's own ac|count, no more WHITES belong to the Church than about <HI>one third part</HI> of between two and three Million, after eight hundred and forty four thou&s;and Blacks have been deducted. And yet this reckoning, though it takes off &s;everal hundred thou&s;ands from the MILLION profe&s;&s;ors of the Church, that had been before number|ed, is carried much too high, the <HI>Blacks</HI> not being ad|mitted into the account; as may be &s;een in what is &s;aid above.</NOTE> among the
<PB N="113" REF="010853_0112_0F85224FDDD690A8">
members of their Church"; though not one in fifty of them know any thing more of Chri&s;tianity, than tho&s;e of the &s;ame color who live in Africa: Otherwi&s;e, it is not po&s;&s;ible their account &s;hould con&s;i&s;t with truth. In the two Provinces of Pen|&s;ylvania and the Jer&s;ies, there are no more than three Epi&s;copal Churches that &s;upport them&s;elves. The Society, if we may depend on their ab&s;tracts, have but nineteen Mi&s;&s;ionaries. The Dr. &s;ays, there are, in the&s;e Colonies, a con&s;iderable number of Churches and Congregations without Clergy|men. It is rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed, the&s;e de&s;titute Congregations, for much the greater part, are &s;imilar to the &s;cattered handfuls of Epi&s;copalians in &s;ome of our New-England towns, con&s;i&s;ting, in &s;ome places, of three or four; in others, of half a dozen; in others &s;till, of a dozen or fifteen fa|milies. However, that there might be no com|plaint that we are di&s;po&s;ed to le&s;&s;en their real number, we &s;hall reckon them all as Congrega|tions equally numerous with tho&s;e that have Mi&s;|&s;ionaries. Their number then, according to the Dr. will be forty-&s;even; which, with the three we before mentioned, will make fifty.&mdash;In the Pro|vince
<PB N="114" REF="010853_0113_0F85225026266738">
of New-York, there are three Epi&s;copal Churches that &s;ub&s;i&s;t without help from the So|ciety. The Mi&s;&s;ionaries, by the ab&s;tracts, are eleven; and as the Dr. has &s;aid nothing here of de&s;titute Churches, we &s;hall take it for granted, that fourteen is the number of Epi&s;copal Con|gregations in this Province.&mdash;In the four New-England Colonies, Connecticut, Rhode-I&s;land, Ma&s;&s;acu&s;etts, and New-Hamp&s;hire, there may be three Epi&s;copal Churches that are &s;upported within them&s;elves, though I certainly know of no more than two. The Mi&s;&s;ionaries, by the Society's account, are thirty. The members of the Church, &s;ettled here and there in towns, where there are no Mi&s;|&s;ionaries, may po&s;&s;ibly make a number equal to &s;ix or &s;even Congregations that are &s;upplied with Clergymen. The Churches then, in the New-England-Colonies, will be forty. According to this computation, which, I am per&s;uaded, exceeds the truth, there are, in the &s;even Colonies, extend|ing from Pen&s;ylvania to the utmo&s;t northern bounds of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Province, one hun|dred and four Epi&s;copal Churches. Let it now be &s;uppo&s;ed, there are fifty families belonging to a Church one with another; which, I believe, Epi&s;copalians them&s;elves will think full allowance. Let it al&s;o be &s;uppo&s;ed, there are five per&s;ons to each family; which is again large allowance, as there are few families in which all the members go to Church: In &s;ome, not more than one goes; in others, not more than two or three. The a|mount then of all the&s;e profe&s;&s;ors of the Church is only twenty &s;ix thou&s;and; a meer handful in compa|ri&s;on with more than a million per&s;ons, which, with|out di&s;pute, live within the&s;e bounds. And, if we &s;hould take in Nova-Scotia, in which there are more
<PB N="115" REF="010853_0114_0F85225132ABFC20">
of other denominations, than there are of Epi&s;co|palians, the number would not ri&s;e to more than twenty eight or twenty nine thou&s;and. But we will allow thirty thou&s;and. There is &s;till wanting nine hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and to make up the MILLION of Epi&s;copalian profe&s;&s;ors we are told of. And where &s;hall we find the&s;e? Are they to be found in the Colonies &s;outhward of Pen&s;ylvania? In all the&s;e, unle&s;s we reckon the blacks as members of the Church of England, we &s;hall fall va&s;tly &s;hort of the number that is want|ed; and the &s;ame mu&s;t be &s;aid, &s;hould we take in all the <HI>whites</HI> of all the Engli&s;h We&s;t-India I&s;lands. It is acknowledged, there are more Epi&s;|copalians in Virginia and Maryland, than other denominations; but all their <HI>white</HI> inhabitants, together with tho&s;e of the Carolinaes, and Georgia, even to Florida, will not make one half the num|ber that is wanting; as might be made to appear by &s;urveys that have been taken of their numbers. But if we &s;ub&s;tract Quakers, Bapi&s;ts, Pre&s;byterians, and Roman-Catholics, which are numerous e&s;pe|cially in Maryland, and tho&s;e al&s;o who make no profe&s;&s;ion at all, and attend no public wor&s;hip after any mode whatever, [and &s;urely it would be too &s;hameful to reckon &s;uch as "members of the Church"] it is really que&s;tionable, whether the a|mount of Epi&s;copal profe&s;&s;ors, in all the&s;e Colonies, will be more than about two hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and. So that, confining our&s;elves to the A|merican Colonies, it cannot, as we judge, be &s;up|po&s;ed, with any probability of rea&s;on, that there are &s;o many as one third part of that MILLION of "members of the Church" the Dr. has reckon|ed, not taking in the <HI>blacks</HI> So widely di&s;tant are our apprehen&s;ions from his, concerning this matter.</P>

EITHER the Gentleman that made "a &s;urvey of the inhabitants in the Colonies and I&s;lands, and a di|&s;tribution of them into their &s;everal cla&s;&s;es, in 1762", was egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken, or the Dr. in his account from him, when he &s;ays, "of the <HI>whites,</HI> the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the Church were about a third part; the Pre&s;byterians, Independants and Anabapti&s;ts, were not &s;o many; the Germans and other denomina|tions amounted to more". There are no indepen|dants that I know of in any of the Provinces. The Pre&s;byterians and Congregationi&s;ts are perhaps as numerous as all the other denominations, Non-epi&s;copal, put together; and the&s;e only are more than double the number of all the Epi&s;copalian-<HI>whites</HI> on the American Continent; as could de|mon&s;trably be made to appear, was it worth while to be at the trouble of making calculations, and exhibiting the grounds on which they are made.</P>
<P>THE Dr. to add force to his argument in favor of the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops, would bring in the Ne|groes, "who have been found, &s;ays he, to be about eight hundred and forty four thou&s;and". His head and heart are &s;o filled with the notion of an Epi&s;co|pate, that he &s;eems di&s;po&s;ed to imagine it the be&s;t fitted mean for every good purpo&s;e that can be men|tioned. As he thought it proper to take notice of the poor Negroes, could he have hit upon nothing but an Epi&s;copate for their relief? This, at be&s;t, is a far-fetch'd, round-about expedient; and would, probably be of little &s;ervice, was it to take effect. Their forlorn ca&s;e calls for a more direct and pow|erful remedy. As "&s;harers with us in the &s;ame common nature", have they not the &s;ame natural e&s;&s;ential rights? And are not the&s;e outragiou&s;ly invaded, while they are held in ignoble &s;lavery?
<PB N="117" REF="010853_0116_0F85225271C17510">
Are they not inhumanly trampled upon, while they are treated as though they were nothing better than &s;o many bea&s;ts of burden? It is mo&s;t horribly &s;hameful, that &s;o many of the human &s;pecies, as good by nature as their ma&s;ters, and that have as good a right to the FREEDOM OF MEN, &s;hould be bought and &s;old as though they were cattle; and dealt with as though they were an inferior order to dogs! If, in&s;tead of an Epi&s;copate, for the be|nefit of the&s;e greate&s;t of all &s;ufferers in his Ma|je&s;ty's dominions, an act of Parliament had been propo&s;ed to &s;et them all free, or to prohibit the en&s;laving any more for time to come, or to re&s;train the cruelty of the Planters in their u&s;uage of them, it would have been much more to the purpo&s;e. It is a di&s;honor to Engli&s;hmen, who e&s;teem it their di&s;tingui&s;hing glory, that they enjoy the fulle&s;t rea&s;onable liberty, to make SLAVES, and in the mo&s;t abject &s;en&s;e, of &s;uch amazing numbers of their fellow-men. It is an abomination highly worthy of a Parliamentary interpo&s;ition. This would do the poor Negroes infinitely more &s;ervice, than to &s;ettle an Epi&s;copate over their ma&s;ters, who can|not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any tolerable degree of religion, while they thus palpably break in upon the mo&s;t evidently plain laws of righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s, to their eternal di&s;grace as rea&s;onable moral agents. I have often wondered, nothing has been done in the Colonies to put a &s;top to the cruelly unju&s;t practice of making &s;laves of the poor Negroes; e&s;pecially, as they have, for &s;ome years, been &s;ighing out the mo&s;t bitter complaints again&s;t all tendencies towards their being en&s;laved them|&s;elves. Is this to act a con&s;i&s;tent part? Is it, in any equitable &s;en&s;e, doing to others as they would others &s;hould do to them?</P>

THE la&s;t argument, "for granting an Ameri|can Epi&s;copate", is taken "from the obligations of gratitude; a national &s;en&s;e of which ought, at this time, to have peculiar efficacy": As, "by a &s;ignal interpo&s;ition of divine providence, the Briti&s;h arms in America have triumphed over all that oppo&s;ed them, prodigiou&s;ly extending our Colo|nies by new acqui&s;itions, and &s;ecuring them, not only by treaty, but by a total annihilation of that power on the Continent, whereby our former &s;afety was chiefly endangered". What &s;pecial connecti|on the victorious &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms in America, under the ble&s;&s;ing of providence, has with the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an Epi&s;copate here, is not &s;o very ea&s;ie to di&s;cern. It is readily owned, "every wi&s;e nation &s;ees and acknowledges God in &s;uch events: and every religious nation will make &s;ome &s;utable returns to him for &s;uch extraordinary favors". And it is hoped, &s;ome &s;uch returns have been made. If not, the nation, including the Co|lonies, are ju&s;tly chargeable with great ingratitude to that al-wi&s;e righteous being, who turned the late war &s;o much in their favor. But, &s;ays the Dr. "the circum&s;tances of things evidently point out two duties to our Governors, both of them im|portant in them&s;elves, and of indi&s;pen&s;ible obliga|tion. One is, the further &s;ecurity and &s;upport of the true religion in America, in tho&s;e places, where it already is; and the other, the propagation of it in tho&s;e places to which it has not hitherto been extended". By the "farther &s;ecurity and &s;upport of the TRUE RELIGION in America", the Dr. mu&s;t mean, to make his arguing pertinent, the providing for the &s;upport of an Epi&s;co|pate, as an expedient for the &s;ecurity of the TRUE RELIGION, that is, the religion of the
<PB N="119" REF="010853_0118_0F852253E79919A8">
Church of England. Surely, his imagination has here got the better of his judgment. Is the reli|gion of the Church of England the only true re|ligion on the American Continent? Is religion, in none of the other forms, to be regarded? Were Epi&s;copalians the only Coloni&s;ts employed, under God, to effect the late glorious conque&s;ts? We do not e&s;teem it a duty, much le&s;s an indi&s;pen&s;ible one, in con&s;equence of the&s;e conque&s;ts, to provide for the &s;ecurity or &s;upport of the religion of Epi&s;|copalians, any more than the religion of other de|nominations of chri&s;tians in the Colonies. And of all denominations, the profe&s;&s;ors of the Church have the lea&s;t to &s;ay upon the head of "farther &s;upport", as they are, in mo&s;t of the Colonies, pro|vided for by the Society at home at an annual great expence.&mdash;As to the other duty, "the propagation of religion, in tho&s;e places to which it has not been extended"; &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of it was impre&s;&s;ed upon the hearts of the rulers, mini&s;ters and Laity, more e&s;pecially in this Province, that proper mea&s;ures were concerted, and Mi&s;&s;ionaries actually &s;ent to the Mohawk-Country, to carry the go&s;pel to them; but the whole de&s;ign was made void, becau&s;e it was not to be executed by profe&s;&s;ors of the Church, according to the Epi&s;copalian mode. More may be &s;aid of this hereafter.</P>
<P>THE Dr. goes on, "as America is the region, wherein the divine goodne&s;s has been more im|mediately di&s;played in favor of the Briti&s;h nation; &s;o America is evidently the very ground on which &s;ome &s;utable monument of gratitude ought to be erected". And what monument is this? In con|&s;i&s;tency with the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent argument, it mu&s;t be the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an Epi&s;copate.
<PB N="120" REF="010853_0119_0F8522555C415660">
How is this made out? After the following man|ner, if at all; "the honor of God is mo&s;t directly promoted by public wor&s;hip&mdash;that wor&s;hip mu&s;t be mo&s;t acceptable to him, wherein the adoration of his creatures are regularly offered him, in the &s;olemn offices of the pure&s;t and be&s;t religion&mdash;and the national religion mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t to an|&s;wer the&s;e characters in the national opinion". It is far from being true, that the religious adorations of the Church of England are the "pure&s;t and be&s;t", or that their wor&s;hip is, on this account, "mo&s;t acceptable to God". But, &s;uppo&s;ing this to be the <HI>national opinion,</HI> meaning hereby, the o|pinion of tho&s;e in the nation, who are members of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church; what is the con&s;equence herefrom? Says the Dr. "it naturally follows, that the &s;tate of the national religion here [in the Colonies] has a right, on this occa&s;ion, to the pe|culiar attention of tho&s;e, who are entru&s;ted with the direction of our public affairs". It needs &s;omething more than a bare affirmation to make this an undoubted truth. The other denomina|tions think they have as good a right, as the Epi&s;|copalians, to the attention of tho&s;e, who have the management of the public affairs; and, in many of the Colonies, it is thought, they have, in &s;trict ju&s;tice, a PECULIAR right. But, let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the PECULIAR right lies on the &s;ide of the Church of England;&mdash;what then? This Church, in America, without a Bi&s;hop, "is peri&s;hing for want of common nece&s;&s;aries; &s;he has been long imploring relief under &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es, [being de&s;ti|tute of a Bi&s;hop] as mu&s;t prove fatal to her, if much longer neglected". What is the con&s;e|quence? Her reque&s;t mu&s;t be an&s;wered, as a SUTABLE MONUMENT OF GRATITUDE for the
<PB N="121" REF="010853_0120_0F8522560B379118">
late divine appearances in favor of the Briti&s;h arms in America. Heaven and earth are called upon to judge, whether this is unrea&s;onable! This is the Dr's argument in full force, &s;o far as it has any. Upon which I would a&s;k, is it indeed a truth, that the Church of England, in the Colonies, "is in a peri&s;hing condition for want of nece&s;&s;aries"? Is it a real object of faith, that "her di&s;ea&s;es are &s;uch as mu&s;t prove fatal to her", if &s;he is much longer with|out a Bi&s;hop? Surely, this repre&s;entation of her ca&s;e mu&s;t be the effect of zeal, not conducted by knowledge. And, had not the Dr. been under the influence of an undue warmth of &s;pirit, he would never have thought, much le&s;s have pub|licly &s;aid, that an AMERICAN EPISCOPATE, for the relief of the Church, under her di&s;ea&s;es opera|ting to her &s;peedy ruin, was that SPECIAL MONU|MENT OF GRATITUDE that ought to be erected in return for God's goodne&s;s; di&s;played in favor of the Briti&s;h arms in this part of the world. I &s;carce know how to &s;peak upon the matter &s;eriou&s;ly, it is placed in &s;o ludicrous a light Notwith&s;tanding the "di&s;ea&s;ed peri&s;hing" &s;tate of the American Church, have not prai&s;es and adorations, accord|ing to the "pure&s;t and be&s;t" forms of devotion, been offered up to almighty God, in all the Epi&s;copal a&s;&s;emblies on the Continent, for the marvellous interpo&s;itions of his providence, on our behalf, in the late war? If this is not the truth, they are far behind the other denominations of chri&s;tians, who&s;e religious thankful adorations have publicly been pre&s;ented to the divine maje&s;ty on this ac|count, in their way, however &s;hort it may have fallen of the "better and more pure" mode of prai&s;ing God in practice by the Church. There have al&s;o been NATIONAL religious adorations for
<PB N="122" REF="010853_0121_0F8522562CAFD5A8">
this NATIONAL mercy; and, if they proceeded from truly thankful hearts, they are, in the ac|count of the &s;acred books, a &s;utable expre&s;&s;ion of gratitude. But the Church here is &s;till in want of Bi&s;hops; and there is therefore &s;till wanting the mo&s;t SUTABLE MONUMENT OF GRATITUDE, for the&s;e favors of heaven. Grateful hearts, and well-ordered conver&s;ations, may po&s;&s;ibly be as SUTABLE MONUMENTS, upon this occa&s;ion, as the &s;ettle|ment of an EPISCOPATE. If the Coloni&s;ts, whe|ther Epi&s;copalians, or others, have not, by this goodne&s;s of God, been engaged to love him with all their hearts, and to &s;erve him with all their powers, no other return will atone for the want of this, not excepting there being an EPISCOPATE e&s;tabli&s;hed here. This is what God mainly ex|pects; with this he will be plea&s;ed, yea, a thou|&s;and times more plea&s;ed, than with the mi&s;&s;ion of as many Bi&s;hops as can be de&s;ired. I appeal to heaven and earth for the truth of this.</P>

<HEAD>ANSWER to SECTION VII. in which the Ca&s;e of the American Heathens is particularly con&s;idered, and &s;aid to require an Epi&s;copate.</HEAD>
<P>WE are as fully &s;en&s;ible as the Dr. or any of the Epi&s;copalians, can be, that it is "the duty of tho&s;e whom the "day-&s;pring from on high" has vi&s;ited, to communicate this light to others, and, as they have opportunity, to give the knowledge of religion to tho&s;e who are without it". We think, with him, that "the providence of God points out this general duty by the late events, more plainly and expre&s;ly than ever. We never had until this time, &s;o favourable an opportunity for carrying for|ward this ble&s;&s;ed work: We never had it &s;o much in our power; and our obligations of gratitude were never &s;o &s;trong"; nor the arguments that may be fetched from the "principles of worldly policy". The&s;e, and &s;uch like, powerful motives have often been urged upon our people, both publicly and privately. We do therefore mo&s;t cordially join with the Dr. in every thing he has &s;aid to repre|&s;ent the rea&s;onablene&s;s, the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of a pious concern for the aboriginal-natives of America, expre&s;&s;ed in all &s;utable endeavours to aquaint them with "the go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God". The differ|ence between us lies in this, we do not think, that
<PB N="124" REF="010853_0123_0F852257AC636B28">
an Epi&s;copate in the Colonies is &s;o connected with this duty, but that it may very well be performed without one; nor do we believe that an Epi&s;co|pate is peculiarly pointed out by tho&s;e events that have made the pre&s;ent, the mo&s;t convenient time for extending the knowledge of the only true God, and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to the&s;e uttermo&s;t parts of the earth. The Dr. is of the contrary opinion. His principal aim indeed, in this &s;ection, is to &s;hew, that our duty, in regard of the Ame|rican-Heathen, more e&s;pecially in con&s;ideration of the happy events of the late war, requires an E|pi&s;copate. His rea&s;oning here takes in a variety of articles. They are comprehended in the fol|lowing &s;ummary, but ju&s;t, repre&s;entation. <Q>From repeated trials, it appears, that there mu&s;t be &s;ome more effectual way for the conver&s;ion of Savages, than has been yet taken. It was hoped that the conver&s;ion of Indians would na|turally introduce among them civility of man|ners; but it &s;eems now to be generally agreed, that what was propo&s;ed as a <HI>con&s;equence,</HI> ought to be con&s;idered as a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary means</HI> of &s;preading the go&s;pel among &s;avage nations.&mdash;It having then become a &s;ettled point, that the mo&s;t pro|per way for converting Savages, is previou&s;ly to in&s;truct them in the arts and manners of civil life, the SOCIETY has been, for a con&s;iderable time, employed in collecting &s;uch intelligence, relating to this &s;ubject, as to enable them to form a proper plan for civilizing the nations of America, in order to their being chri&s;tians.&mdash;But a variety of plans have been tran&s;mitted from this Country. The per&s;ons who have been con&s;ulted, have their particular prejudices and attachments. The things and places which one
<PB N="125" REF="010853_0124_0F852258646FB2A0">
repre&s;ents as expedient, are condemned by ano|ther.&mdash;To balance and adju&s;t &s;o many different repre&s;entations would be a work of much time, and of cour&s;e retard the execution of the gene|ral plan. A fal&s;e &s;tep in the beginning might produce con&s;equences that are fatal. But the&s;e difficulties would vani&s;h, in a great mea&s;ure, un|der an Epi&s;copate. In a &s;y&s;tem of this kind, where a number of powers and movements are to be employed, to one common purpo&s;e, a re|gular and con&s;i&s;tent direction of them is requi|&s;ite.&mdash;Upon the whole, a Bi&s;hop is thought to be the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to be entru&s;ted with this &s;uper-intending influence, one therefore mu&s;t be appointed and &s;ent in order to a compli|ance with the duty, ari&s;ing from the late victo|ries on the American-Continent.</Q> This, in &s;um, is the Dr's argument in all it's parts.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t; "it's being generally agreed, that the mo&s;t proper way for converting Savages, is previou&s;ly to in&s;truct them in the arts and man|ners of civil life"; it may be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, whether it exhibits the truth of fact. I am confi|dent it does not, if this "general agreement" is &s;up|po&s;ed to extend to the more northern Colonies. We are here pretty generally inclined to think, that the increa&s;e of temptations, from the arts and manners of civil life, would rather be an hindrance to their conver&s;ion, than a previou&s;ly proper requi|&s;ite in order to it. The Indian-Natives have certain|ly been hurt, not &s;erved, by being put into the Eng|li&s;h way of living. Many tribes of them, in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Province, have, by this means, been &s;o depopulated, that there are now &s;carce any re|mains of them to be &s;een. And I am fully per|&s;uaded,
<PB N="126" REF="010853_0125_0F85225930151CD0">
the taking them off from the way of life they have been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to, and getting them into that which is in u&s;e among us, would be an effectual method to put an end to their lives in the world. Nor is there any need of what is called civilizing them, in order to their embracing Chri&s;tianity. Their being Savages, and living in a way different from what we do, is no rea&s;on why their conver&s;ion may not be expected, if &s;utable means are u&s;ed with them. The de&s;ign of the re|ligion of Je&s;us is to humani&s;e, as well as chri&s;tiani&s;e the &s;oul, to meliorate the temper, to &s;often it's roughne&s;s, and of &s;avage to make it meek and gentle. And this will be it's effect, in whom&s;oever it is really planted; and, without &s;uch implantation, men may be &s;avage, notwith&s;tanding the arts and manners of civil life; in&s;tances of which are too common, even in the mo&s;t civili&s;ed nations. It may be worthy of notice here, the Canadians ne|ver made it any part of their care to change the Indian's mode of civil life; and yet, they found ways to attach numerous tribes of them &s;o firmly to the religion of Rome, that it is a vain thing to try to bring them to a better &s;en&s;e of things. And why may not we, in like manner, implant the reli|gion of the go&s;pel in the minds of tho&s;e, who have not been as yet indoctrinated in the principles of Popery? Should we expend as much zeal and pains to make them good Chri&s;tians, as the French have done to make them good Catholics, we &s;hould, I doubt not, &s;oon &s;ee the happy fruits of it; though no care &s;hould be taken to bring them into our way of civil life.</P>
<P>THE next link in the chain of rea&s;oning is, "the Society's having, after great pains in collecting
<PB N="127" REF="010853_0126_0F852259F5C10068">
informations, formed a plan to civili&s;e the Indian-Nations, in order to the making them Chri&s;tians". One would not have expected to have &s;een the Society brought in here, as &s;o e&s;&s;ential a part of the argument. For it is affirmed, a few pages back, "if we examine it's Charter, we &s;hall find it as evident as language can make it, that the &s;up|port and propagation of the go&s;pel among OUR OWN PEOPLE IN AMERICA, was the immediate and principal de&s;ign of their incorporation. The conver&s;ion of the heathen was not their primary and immediate object". This is &s;aid to &s;hew, that the Society has been "abu&s;ed", when &s;poken of as expending their charity in the Engli&s;h Colonies, to the too great neglect of the Indian-Heathen. And tho&s;e who have been thus "abu&s;ive to the Soci|ety" are charged with the guilt of "petulent tongues", or "pens". But now an Epi&s;copate is in view, it is their proper work, and in di&s;tinction from all others, to di&s;charge the duty of &s;ending the go&s;pel to the American-infidel Natives. The writers on the Epi&s;copalian &s;ide have the advan|tage beyond all others. They can make u&s;e of the &s;ame argument, with a good grace, to contrary purpo&s;es. When the Church is to be increa&s;ed in the Colonies, the Society perfectly fall in with the great de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, while they lay out &s;o much of their money to &s;erve this end, that they have little left to chri&s;tiani&s;e the Indians; but when a Bi&s;hop is wanted, and chri&s;tiani&s;ing the In|dians can be u&s;ed as an argument for his mi&s;&s;ion, it at once becomes the great work of this Society; and they, in di&s;tinction from all others, mu&s;t en|gage in it as their inviolable duty. And I will &s;uppo&s;e it to be their bu&s;ine&s;s, for I really believe it is, and in virtue of their Charter, however inatten|tive
<PB N="128" REF="010853_0127_0F85225AC08C9830">
they may have been to this part of the tru&s;t that has been committed to them. And what follows herefrom? The argument goes on.</P>
<P>"THERE are &s;o many plans and propo&s;als, &s;o many different opinions in different per&s;ons, and &s;uch a number of difficulties ari&s;ing, in regard of this work of chri&s;tiani&s;ing the Indians, that there is a nece&s;&s;ity for one &s;uper-intending direction; and who &s;o proper for this as a Bi&s;hop? Sir William John&s;on's experience in, and careful attention to, Indian-affairs, may make him the be&s;t qualified per&s;on for a Political &s;uper-intendant; but, as the great end in view is the advancement and propa|gation of the chri&s;tian religion, there mu&s;t evi|dently appear a peculiar propriety in carrying on the work under the direction of a Bi&s;hop". To all which the an&s;wer is, If a Bi&s;hop was now re&s;i|dent in the Colonies, it is que&s;tionable whether it would be fit to entru&s;t him with this &s;uper-intend|ing power. He might, as he ought to, be better qualified for this office than any other Clergy-man; but a Bi&s;hop cannot do every thing. If the care of all the Epi&s;copal-Clergy is committed to him, this, one would think, is, in all rea&s;on, full work enough for him, if not a great deal too much. He would not find it an ea&s;ie matter to perform it with fidelity. This &s;uper-intending bu&s;ine&s;s might therefore, to better purpo&s;e, be put into other hands. The Society in Scotland, for the propaga|tion of chri&s;tian knowledge, appoint Commi&s;&s;ion|ers, and from the Laity as well as Clergy, to con|duct and manage their affairs, when at a di&s;tance, and not within reach of their own immediate in|&s;pection. The honorable Company for the pro|pagation of the go&s;pel in New-England, and places
<PB N="129" REF="010853_0128_0F85225B884F5990">
adjacent in America, have, from the beginning of their incorporation, acted upon the &s;ame plan, and thou&s;ands of the poor Indians, in execution of it, have been chri&s;tiani&s;ed. They have, at this day&punc; within the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Province, under the &s;u|per-intending direction of their Commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;ix|teen Clergy-men, Engli&s;h and Indian, &s;tatedly labouring, either as Pa&s;tors of &s;o many Indian-Churches, or as Preachers to a&s;&s;emblies of Indians that meet together for divine wor&s;hip; nine Engli&s;h Lecturers, and &s;even &s;tated School-ma&s;ters, be&s;ides occa&s;ional ones. They have likewi&s;e a Mi&s;&s;ionary in the Mohawk Country, and an In|terpreter who has been &s;upported at Ohonoquague from a boy on purpo&s;e to learn their language, which he can now &s;peak with as much freedom as any of the Indians, and with va&s;tly more propriety. This young man is al&s;o a School-ma&s;ter to the chil|dren in that Indian town. It may be feared, the other Society in England will never accompli&s;h any great things, unle&s;s upon a plan of a like nature. It is heartily wi&s;hed this Society would, in good earne&s;t, engage in the affair of Go&s;peli&s;ing the Indians, and that they would be thorow in it, not merely to promote a party-intere&s;t, or to favor the de&s;ign of &s;ettling an Epi&s;copate here; but purely to extend the knowledge of the way to &s;alvation though Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the only Savior of men. It may be feared, whether, in what is propo&s;ed to be done by the Society, a regard to the Church, as e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, may not be too much mingled with the common cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>I SHALL not think it impertinent to add here, "as America is the region wherein the divine

goodne&s;s has been more remarkably di&s;played in favor of the Briti&s;h Nation"; &s;o Americans are the proper per&s;ons to erect "&s;ome &s;utable mo|nument of religious gratitude" on this account. And what more &s;utable one, than a vi&s;ible per|petually &s;tanding te&s;timony of their pious con|cern, and earne&s;t care, to &s;pread the knowledge of that only Lord who has done &s;uch great, things for them? The Non-epi&s;copal Clergy and Laity, in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Province, were &s;o filled with a &s;en&s;e of the peculiar fitne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ing their gratitude to heaven in this way, that they volun|tarily and liberally contributed, upon the conclu|&s;ion of the late war, towards the immediate &s;up|port of two Mi&s;&s;ionaries in the MOHAWK-Country; who were accordingly &s;ent, and &s;o far &s;ucceeded in their labors, that the Indians de&s;ired to have a Church gathered, and to have the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper admini&s;tred to them. And, upon di&s;cour&s;ing with them with this view, it was found that a number of them were well indoctri|nated in the e&s;&s;ential principles of Chri&s;tianity, and had upon their minds an uniform practical &s;en&s;e of religion. A &s;chool al&s;o was &s;et up for the in&s;truction of their children. But, be&s;ides this provi&s;ion for the pre&s;ent, they were zealou&s;ly de&s;irous of having a perpetually continuing one. In order to this, two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling were &s;ub&s;cribed, in a week, in the town of Bo&s;ton, upon condition there might be an incorporated Society among our &s;elves for the conducting and managing this important affair. An incorpora|ting act was prepared, and pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;everal branches of the Government here, and &s;ent home for the Royal &s;anction, without which it could
<PB N="131" REF="010853_0130_0F85225CEA9542A8">
not continue in force. But it &s;oon met with a Negative, by which means this whole money was lo&s;t, and as much more we had good rea&s;on to expect would &s;oon have been &s;ub&s;cribed, be&s;ides the income of many hundred pounds &s;terling that had been devoted to the &s;ervice of the Indians. The Public will judge, whether it was not hard, &s;everely hard, to be re&s;trained from making u&s;e of our own money in carrying on &s;o good a work as that of chri&s;tiani&s;ing the Indians; e&s;pecially, as it was intended as a "monument of gratitude" to heaven for the marvellous di&s;play of it's good|ne&s;s to us in the late war. We e&s;teemed this hard&s;hip the greater, as, but a few years before, an incorporating act was confirmed at home, though upon a good de&s;ign, yet upon a far le&s;s important one. And we &s;hould e&s;teem the hard|&s;hip much greater &s;till, if, in any mea&s;ure, it was brought upon us by EPISCOPAL influence. I will not too po&s;itively &s;ay that it was; but this I will &s;ay, and in the words of a letter from home, wrote by a Gentleman that well under&s;tood what he was about; <Q>There is rea&s;on to think, that an account of your proceedings [relative to the incorporating act] was &s;ent to LAMBETH, as early as to&mdash;. The A&mdash;h-B&mdash;p was pre|judiced with a notion, that the Society had re|fu&s;ed to admit the Epi&s;copalians at Bo&s;ton to &s;ub&s;cribe to the undertaking. [This was an ab&s;olute fal&s;ehood.] The umbrage taken at this new Society was &s;uch, that any the lea&s;t attempt to take &s;ub&s;criptions here would have blown up the &s;u&s;picions of the CHURCH, and of the SOCIETY FOR PROPAGATING THE GOS|PEL, into an open flame again&s;t it.

<HEAD>ANSWER to SECTION VIII. in which the Plan, on which alone American Bi&s;hops have been reque&s;ted, is fairly &s;tated, with Expo&s;tula|tions on the Rea&s;onablene&s;s thereof.</HEAD>
<P>THE repetitions, with which the Dr. begins this &s;ection, and in con&s;equence of which he hopes for the attention of his &s;uperiors, and the &s;ettlement of an American-Epi&s;copate, have been already con&s;idered. One thing he has menti|oned, previous to his introducing the plan upon this head, it may not be ami&s;s to take &s;ome notice of. It is in the&s;e words, <Q>Will not the complaints of near a million of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in America, of unimpeached loyalty and fidelity, who are &s;uffering under the mo&s;t unprecedented hard|&s;hips with regard to religion, an intere&s;t dearer than property, and more inviolable than civil liberty, be regarded, and procure the redre&s;s of &s;o intolerable a grievance?</Q> He had before &s;aid, pag. 45. that "the Church of England in Ame|rica contains near a million of members"; and re|peated it again, pag. 81;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About the time of writing the above, there appeared in one of our Public papers, a Copy of the Petition that was &s;ent, by a number of the Epi&s;copal-Clergy, to the univer&s;ity of Cambridge; which, as it agreed with other copies that had been &s;een, and contained nothing in it that has been excepted again&s;t, may be looked upon as genuine. And, in this view of it, I would ob&s;erve, that "the people belonging to the Church of England, in America", are &s;aid "to be more than a million". This differs from the Dr s account, which is, "near a mil|lion". But in&s;tead of charging the&s;e accounts with incon&s;i&s;tency, I would rather &s;ay, they may both be equally true; the number may be "near a million", or "more than a million", ju&s;t as the Epi&s;copalians plea&s;e, if the NEGROE-SLAVES are reckoned; for, as the Dr. has told us, "they were found, in the &s;urvey that was made, in 1762, to be eight hundred and forty four thou&s;and". So that, by only greatning or le&s;&s;ening the number of the&s;e NEGROES, the "members of the Church" will be either "near", or quite, or "more than a million"; though, if they are not reckoned, [and it would be to an high degree &s;hameful to attempt to reckon them] the number of Epi&s;copalians will be at once decrea&s;ed many hundred thou&s;ands.&mdash;It is farther &s;aid, in the next paragraph, "the extent of inhabited Country which hath hitherto, with re&s;pect to Epi&s;co|pacy, been neglected, is &s;ome thou&s;ands of miles". Has not this declaration, &s;imply as it &s;tands, a tendency to lead &s;trangers into a wrong conception of the inha|bitants of this extent, as to their religious denominati|on? It is indeed true, that this "extent is &s;ome thou|&s;ands of miles"; but it is as true, as to it's one half, that not a thirtieth part of the inhabitants are Epi&s;co|palians; and, as to the other half, that their number will be va&s;tly le&s;&s;ened, when a deduction has been made, as it ought to be, of the other denominations, together with tho&s;e who profe&s;s no religion, and are equally in|different to every mode in which it is exerci&s;ed. It would have been but fair, if &s;ome hint, at lea&s;t, of this kind had been &s;ugge&s;ted. As the pa&s;&s;age now &s;tands, tho&s;e, to whom the petition was &s;ent, would naturally be led to think, that the inhabitants, through this large extent, were mo&s;tly, if not wholly, profe&s;&s;ors of the Church of England: Though the Petitioners them&s;elves knew, if they had entertained this idea of them, it would not, in any tolerable degree, have con|&s;i&s;ted with truth. It may, I believe, be ju&s;tly &s;aid, if there had been more &s;implicity, and le&s;s art, in the wording this petition, it would not have been &s;o ex|ceptionable as it now is.</NOTE> though there is no
<PB N="134" REF="010853_0133_0F8522628A1204A8">
rea&s;on to think, as has been before ob&s;erved, there is one third part of this number on the American-Continent, and not &s;o much as a thirtieth in all the Colonies to the northward of Maryland, which are much the mo&s;t populous, and bid fair to be &s;till more &s;o, as they increa&s;e with much the greate&s;t rapidity. We are now told of the "COMPLAINTS of this nearly a million of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects". If they have complained, their complaints have been kept &s;ecret in their own brea&s;ts, and not divulged
<PB N="135" REF="010853_0134_0F8522632A311A08">
to the world. So far as we may judge by the PETITIONS that have been &s;ent home, the Epi&s;co|pal-Clergy ONLY are the complainers. They are certainly the only per&s;ons, we have heard of, who have made any &s;tir about the want of Bi&s;hops; and had not they di&s;covered a re&s;tle&s;s frame of mind, upon this account, no body el&s;e would: Nor, &s;o far as I can learn, are there any con&s;iderable num|bers, to whom they have been able to propagate their unea&s;ine&s;s of &s;pirit. Some of the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable Epi&s;copalians, in the&s;e parts, for &s;obriety, good &s;en&s;e, and a &s;teady attachment to the intere&s;t of the Church of England, have declared it to be their opinion, that Bi&s;hops would be of no &s;ervice here, and that they did not de&s;ire they &s;hould be &s;ent. And it is to me, as well as to many I have conver&s;ed with upon this head, Epi&s;copalians a|mong others, very que&s;tionable, whether, if the members of the Church of England, in the&s;e north|ern

Colonies, were to give in their votes, and to do it without previous Clerical influence, they would be found to be on the &s;ide of an American-Epi&s;copate.&mdash;As to the "mo&s;t unprecedented hard&s;hips, and intolerable grievances" this "million of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects are &s;uffering with regard to re|ligion", they are, as we have &s;een, nothing more than the&s;e;&mdash;that they are not favored with the enjoyment of that "di&s;cipline, the re&s;toration of which cannot RATIONALLY be attempted by tho&s;e in authority", and which, if "much reverenced by any, they would be e&s;teemed WRONG-HEADED, or MEAN SPIRITED, or BOTH": That though or|dination cannot be obtained without going to Eng|land for it; yet that they have good friends there, who will lighten, if not totally take off, this burden, by bearing them&s;elves the expence ari&s;ing there|from: And, in fine, that they put the Society at home at a va&s;t expence of charity, without which the Epi&s;|copal Churches, in many of the Colonies, would be in danger of &s;oon dropping into Non-exi&s;tence. And notwith&s;tanding this groundle&s;s clamor of "un&s;ufferable hard&s;hips, and intolerable griev|ance", the Church of England in America has had more and greater favors be&s;towed on it, than any other denomination of chri&s;tians here; yea, than all of them put together: And it may al&s;o, I be|lieve, with &s;trict truth, be affirmed, that no reli|gious profe&s;&s;ors, in any Colonies on the face of the earth, have been &s;o kindly and charitably encouraged, helped, and, I may &s;ay, upheld in being.</P>
<P>I NOW proceed to take into con&s;ideration the PROPOSED PLAN for an American-Epi&s;copate. It is as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="010853_0136_0F852264608B92D0">
<Q>THAT the Bi&s;hops to be &s;ent to America &s;hall have no authority, but purely of a &s;piritual and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical nature, &s;uch as is derived altogether from the Church, and not from the &s;tate&mdash;That this authority &s;hall operate only upon the Clergy of the Church, and not upon the Laity, nor Di&s;&s;enters of any denominations&mdash;That the Bi|&s;hops &s;hall not interfere with the property, or privileges, whether civil or religious, of Church|men or Di&s;&s;enters&mdash;That, in particular, they &s;hall have no concern with the Probate of Wills, letters of Guardian-&s;hip and Admini&s;tration, or Marriage-licences, nor be judges in any ca&s;es relating thereto&mdash;But, that they &s;hall only ex|erci&s;e the original powers of their offices, as be|fore &s;tared, i e ordain and govern the Clergy, and admini&s;ter confirmation to tho&s;e who &s;hall de&s;ire it.</Q></P>
<P>BEFORE I come to the objections we have to make to this plan, I would previou&s;ly interpo&s;e one thing, weighty in it&s;elf, and of &s;pecial im|portance to tho&s;e, who have been employed in contriving, and opening, it to the world. It is this. They have given no evidence, that they were au|thori&s;ed to this bu&s;ine&s;s; and, in meddling with what they were not duly called to, they have acted in direct violation of as expre&s;s an article as any in the e&s;tabli&s;hed orders of the Church of England. Let it be ob&s;erved here,</P>
<P>THE Dr. introduces this plan with &s;aying, "it has long been &s;ettled by our friends and &s;uperiors at home, and the Clergy of this Country have often &s;ignified their intire approbation and acquie&s;cence therein". And again, when he had wrote the plan
<PB N="138" REF="010853_0137_0F852265316BEE88">
for publication, he adds, "this, without any re&s;er|vation or equivocation, is the exact plan of an American Epi&s;copate, which has been &s;ettled at home". It is truly extraordinary, that Epi&s;copa|lians &s;hould tell us of a SCHEME for the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops to the Colonies &s;ettled at home, and ap|probated by the Clergy of the Church of England here, to the intire neglect of his MAJESTY, the acknowledged SUPREME HEAD of their Church, without whom there can be not only no &s;ettlement of a plan, refering to any Eccle&s;ia&s;tical affair what|ever; but no authority &s;o much as to ATTEMPT to form one. It is ju&s;tly pre&s;umed, if his Maje&s;ty had been in view, when it was &s;aid of this plan, "that it has long been &s;ettled by our friends and &s;uperiors at home", the manner of diction would have been more expre&s;&s;ive of dutiful reverence and &s;ubjection; at lea&s;t, &s;ome intimation would have been given of the RORAL LICENCE to act in this matter. But, in&s;tead of this, a plan is mentioned, and publi&s;hed to the world as a &s;ettled one, with|out &s;o much as an hint of any COMMUNICATED AUTHORITY from his MAJESTY to this purpo&s;e; which is really &s;trange, e&s;pecially if con&s;idered as done by tho&s;e who may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to be well acquainted with the con&s;titution of their own Church, and the va&s;t extent of the King's &s;upre|macy over it. Even the CONVOCATION, when convened by the King's writ, have no authority to &s;ettle any plan without his con&s;ent, nor indeed &s;o much as to ATTEMPT to form one without HIS LICENCE. In the year, 1722, the upper hou&s;e refu&s;ed to act upon a declaration &s;ent to them from the lower hou&s;e, for this rea&s;on in &s;pecial, "that without a ROYAL LICENCE, they had no authority to ATTEMPT, enact, PROMULGE, or execute any

Canon, by whatever name it might be called, which &s;hould concern either doctrine or di&s;cipline".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Calamy's abridgement, vol. I. pag. 639. This refu&s;al of the upper hou&s;e, for the given rea&s;on, perfectly agrees, with what was enacted by the &s;tatute, 25th Henry 8. called the act of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, decreeing 1. That the convocation &s;hould, from thenceforth, be a&s;&s;embled only by the <HI>King's writ.</HI> 2. That it &s;hould make no Canons or con&s;titutions, but by the <HI>King's licence,</HI> fir&s;t given them &s;o to do. 3. That having agreed on any Canons or con&s;titutions, they &s;hould neither PUBLISH, nor execute them, without the <HI>King's confirmation.</HI> Nor 4. By his authority, ex|ecute any but with certain limitations.&mdash;Wake's appeal, &amp;c. pag. 4. as cited by the di&s;&s;enting Gentleman, pag. 251. Vid. al&s;o Burn's Eccle&s;ia&s;tical law, under the word, convocation; where the&s;e particulars are mentioned as the purport of this &s;tatute, in the opinion of two chief Ju&s;tices, and divers other Ju&s;tices, at a Commit|tee before the Lords in Parliament.</NOTE> And yet, a plan has been PRIVAETLY formed "by &s;ome friends and &s;uperiors at home", and "AP|PROBATED by the Epi&s;copal Clergy here", and in CONVENED BODIES for the purpo&s;e; which plan is now publi&s;hed to the world, and objectors in|vited to propo&s;e their objections, if they have any, to be tryed at the tribunal of the Public. Is this manner of conduct, in any degree, conformable to the con&s;tituted order of the Church of England? Dare Bi&s;hops, or even Arch-Bi&s;hops, at home, venture upon a method of acting &s;o repugnant to that SUPREMACY in all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, with which, by repeated acts of Parliament, the CROWN has been ve&s;ted? It cannot ea&s;ily be accounted for, that it &s;hould be ventured upon in the Colo|nies. Surely, a Plan for an Epi&s;copate thus form|ed, &s;ettled and publi&s;hed, ought to have no great regard paid to it. Whatever "&s;uperiors at home"
<PB N="140" REF="010853_0139_0F852266AA341F78">
may have had an hand in contriving and &s;ettling this plan, whether they were Bi&s;hops, or Arch-Bi&s;hops, and how "often &s;oever" it may have been "approbated by the Epi&s;copal-Clergy in this Country", it is, in reality, nothing more than their private &s;entiments concerning the matter; and to publi&s;h the&s;e as "a &s;ettled approbated Plan" mu&s;t appear, to all capable judges, an in&s;tance of no &s;mall pre&s;umption: E&s;pecially, if it be remem|bered, that this is done in direct violation of an expre&s;s Canon of the Church of England, guarded with a very heavy penalty; which the Dr. and tho&s;e who put him upon publi&s;hing this plan, may do well to con&s;ider. The Canon, I have in view, is the LXXIIId, which ordains and con&s;titutes, <Q>that no Prie&s;ts, or mini&s;ters of God's word, nor any other per&s;ons, &s;hall meet together in any private hou&s;e, or el&s;ewhere, to con&s;ult upon any matter or cour&s;e to be taken by them, or upon their motion, or direction by any others, which may any way tend to the impeaching, or de|praving of the doctrine of the Church of Eng|land, or of the book of common prayer, or of any part of the government or di&s;cipline now e|&s;tabli&s;hed in the Church of England, under pain of excommunication, ip&s;o facto.</Q> It will not be di&s;puted, that there has been "the meeting to|gether" of &s;ome of the Epi&s;copal-Clergy, &s;uperior or inferior, or both, at home, or in this Country, "in private hou&s;es, or el&s;ewhere, to con&s;ult upon a cour&s;e", yea, to form a Plan, for altering the "government and di&s;cipline of the Church of England" in the Colonies; which, in true mean|ing, and reality of con&s;truction, is a practical "im|peachment" of it; and greatly aggravated, as this plan, thus privately formed, has been publi&s;hed to
<PB N="141" REF="010853_0140_0F85226A6B15BD48">
the world for them to judge of it's rea&s;onablene&s;s. The fact it&s;elf is too flagrant to need any proof; and we &s;hall have occa&s;ion, by and by, to &s;hew, that the planned and publi&s;hed alteration ESSEN|TIALLY breaks in upon the con&s;tituted government and di&s;cipline of the Church of England. How the framers and publi&s;hers of the &s;cheme for this alteration can reconcile their conduct with the a|bove-cited Canon, they are be&s;t able to &s;ay. In the mean time it behoves them to think, whether, by the con&s;titution of their own Church, they are not e&s;teemed excommunicated per&s;ons.</P>
<P>I MIGHT now be rea&s;onably excu&s;ed from tak|ing any further notice of this Plan, as it is, not only de&s;titute of all authority, but comes handed to con&s;ideration in evident contradiction to it. However, I will go on, and di&s;tinctly mention the objections we have to make again&s;t it. And, as "the friends of the Church, to u&s;e the Dr's words, pag. 111. are de&s;irous to know what can be &s;aid, or &s;ugge&s;ted, again&s;t an American Epi&s;copate, in the form wherein it is propo&s;ed to &s;ettle it", and have "reque&s;ted tho&s;e who have any thing to of|fer, to confine them&s;elves to this particular point", I &s;hall endeavour their gratification; and the ra|ther, that they might not have it to &s;ay, "the ob|jections are not to the purpo&s;e", as not being a|gain&s;t the plan that was propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>OBJECT. I. The government and di&s;cipline of the Church of England, under the propo&s;ed Ame|rican Epi&s;copate, is injurious, both to the Church, and the Bi&s;hops that are to pre&s;ide over it.</P>
<P>IT is injurious to the Church. One of the grand pleas, in favor of the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops to the Co|lonies,
<PB N="142" REF="010853_0141_0F85226A8D51B6B8">
has all along been, the "lamentably wretch|ed &s;tate" of the Epi&s;copal Churches in being "without government and di&s;cipline" for want of them; and yet, according to this Plan, "the au|thority of Bi&s;hops", if they are &s;ent, "&s;hall operate only on the Clergy, not the Laity", even of the members of the Church of England. We are fully &s;atisfied with that part of the Plan, which limits their authority within the bounds of the Epi&s;copal Churches, and provides for it's "not operating upon other denominations of chri&s;tians". This we think is highly rea&s;onable. But why &s;hould the government of the&s;e Bi&s;hops be con|fined to the Clergy of the Church of England? Why may not it's Laity al&s;o be favored with the benefit of their governing authority? If this Church is in &s;uffering circum&s;tances, in point of govern|ment and di&s;cipline for want of Bi&s;hops, and to &s;o great a degree as to ju&s;tifie the complaint of "un|precedented hard&s;hip, intolerable grievance", why &s;hould not the Laity, as well as Clergy, be reliev|ed by their mi&s;&s;ion? Are it's Clergy it's only members that need government and di&s;cipline? Are they, beyond all others, inclined to vice, or di&s;orderly in their conduct? It is to be hoped, this is not the real truth: Or if it was, it would not be a ju&s;tification of this part of the Plan. For, if government in the hands of Bi&s;hops is an in&s;ti|tution of Chri&s;t, and intended for the benefit of the Church, including the Laity, as well as the Clergy, why is this di&s;tinction made? What ima|ginable good rea&s;on can be given, why the former, as truly as the latter, &s;hould not be partakers of this benefit? By the con&s;titution of the Engli&s;h Church, the Laity as well as Clergy are put under the governing care of Bi&s;hops; and their autho|rity,
<PB N="143" REF="010853_0142_0F85226B2ECCC620">
at home, extends to both, to the one as truly as to the other. And why &s;hould not the Epi&s;co|pal-Coloni&s;ts enjoy the &s;ame happy privilege? The plain truth is, they are hardly treated in this Plan. They are not merely neglected; but, what is much wor&s;e, expre&s;s provi&s;ion is made that they &s;hall be excluded the benefit of the governing au|thority of their Bi&s;hops. Is this rea&s;onable? Will they, will the world, think it is?</P>
<P>IT is injurious to the Bi&s;hops al&s;o it is propo&s;ed &s;hould be &s;ent to the Colonies. They are, in a meer arbitrary manner, re&s;trained in the exerci&s;e of that authority, which, in the judgment of the&s;e very Planners, properly belongs to them both by apo&s;tolic appointment, and the con&s;titution of the Church of England. Why then &s;hould they be deprived of one half of that, which is their ju&s;t right? If it is fit, they &s;hould be allowed the ex|erci&s;e of their authority in the government of the Epi&s;copal-laity at home, why not in America? What good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for making this wide difference? If Bi&s;hops are &s;ent hither, the Laity of the Epi&s;copal Churches are as properly the objects of their government, as the Clergy; and, if they are con&s;idered either as officers of Chri&s;t, or of the Church of England, it as truly belongs to them to exerci&s;e a governing authority over the one as the other. The limitation of their power, propo&s;ed in the Plan, is therefore an un|rea&s;onable inva&s;ion of their ju&s;t, right as Bi&s;hops; yea, if the government of the Church, as the Dr. has endeavoured to prove, is lodged by Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles, with &s;uch Bi&s;hops as he would have &s;ent to America, will it not &s;avour of &s;piritual robbery to deprive them of it in any part?

why &s;hould any attempt to do &s;o? What &s;pecial end the formers of this Plan might have in their view, by thus limiting their Bi&s;hops authority, I am not able to &s;ay. It is not ea&s;ie to conceive what advantage they could propo&s;e to gain hereby. But, whatever their end was, they have certainly laid their American Bi&s;hops under re&s;traints, in regard of governing authority, that are injurious to them as well as the Laity, as they do not allow them the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e rights, which, they them&s;elves think, properly belong to them, as officers in the kindom of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>OBJECT. II. The Bi&s;hops, in this plan, are &s;o widely different from the Bi&s;hops of the Church of England at home, that it is not rea&s;onable they &s;hould be either de&s;ired, or &s;ent. The Bi&s;hops, propo&s;ed for the Colonies, be&s;ides being re|&s;trained in the exerci&s;e of their authority to the Clergy only, are to be &s;tript of all that civil pow|er, which is, in England, annexed to their eccle|&s;ia&s;tical. And, if we may depend on the Dr's word, they are, moreover, to have no SPIRITUAL COURTS. For he &s;ays, pag. 95. "if our Ameri|can Bi&s;hops are to have no authority over di&s;&s;en|ters, nor indeed to exerci&s;e di&s;cipline over our own people, the Clergy excepted; then the frightful objection of <HI>&s;piritual courts</HI> intirely vani&s;hes. For if no authority of this kind will be claimed, or ex|erci&s;ed by them, we may be &s;ure that no Courts will be erected for the exerci&s;e of it". What kind of Bi&s;hops are here provided for the Colonies? How amazingly different from the Bi&s;hops at home? Is it rea&s;onable to expect the mi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch? I may rather &s;ay, is it rea&s;onable &s;o much as to de&s;ire their mi&s;&s;ion? Have not the
<PB N="145" REF="010853_0144_0F85226CA50C3508">
Di&s;&s;enters in England been complaining for more than an hundred years of the difficulties and hard|&s;hips, ari&s;ing from the unnatural junction of civil and &s;piritual powers in the&s;e Church-officers? Yea, have not Epi&s;copalians them&s;elves, Bi&s;hops as well as others of inferior rank, joined with them in ar|dent wi&s;hes, and importunate intreaties, for a change in the &s;piritual courts, at lea&s;t as to their manner of admini&s;tration? And &s;hall a compara|tive handful of Epi&s;copal profe&s;&s;ors, mo&s;t of whom, in many of the Colonies, are &s;o in&s;ufficient, as that they are upheld in being, with re&s;pect to their religious denomination, at the charitable expence of a di&s;tant Society; I &s;ay, &s;hall the&s;e imagine them&s;elves &s;o important, as that, for their &s;akes, the powers and appendages of Bi&s;hops &s;hall be &s;o mightily abridged? Surely, the whole body of Di&s;&s;enters in England, and a very con&s;iderable part of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church there, are as well worthy of the national attention; and it is as fit, their re|que&s;ts, often repeated, &s;hould be an&s;wered. When this is done, it will be time, and not before, to ex|pect that this plan &s;hould be con&s;idered, and bro't into effect.</P>
<P>NOT that we object again&s;t the propo&s;ed abridg|ment of the power of Bi&s;hops as unrea&s;onable in it&s;elf. We think, on the contrary, it is a wi&s;e and equitable alteration; and heartily wi&s;h, that the&s;e appendages, quite extraneous to the office of Bi|&s;hops, and greatly prejudicial to he faithful exe|cution of it, may no more be united with it. The &s;ooner they are disjoined, and forever &s;eparated, the better. It would, we apprehend, tend greatly to promote the good of the Church of Chri&s;t. But what we object is, the partiality of the propo&s;al;
<PB N="146" REF="010853_0145_0F85226D678602F0">
it's being confined to the Colonies, and not ex|tended to the Mother-country. For if this plan|ned re&s;traint is rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, it is as rea&s;ona|ble it &s;hould take place <HI>there,</HI> as <HI>here;</HI> and to de|&s;ire it <HI>here</HI> upon any other plan than &s;uch an ex|ten&s;ive one as &s;hall operate in England, as well as America, appears to us incon&s;i&s;tent and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>IT may de&s;erve con&s;ideration, as uniformity is one of the main things aimed at in the con&s;titu|tion of the Church of England, whether it would comport with this de&s;ign to make the propo&s;ed difference between Bi&s;hops here and at home? Are they not officers of one and the &s;ame Church, and of equal rank and degree? Why then &s;hould they be thus ve&s;ted with different powers? How di&s;&s;imilar would be the appearance of &s;uch Bi&s;hops? Would it not hurt, if not quite de&s;troy the Church's uniformity, in regard of it's officers? And what mu&s;t we think of a con&s;titution, that would clothe preci&s;ely the &s;ame officers of the &s;ame Church, not with the &s;ame, but with widely differing pow|ers? Would it argue con&s;i&s;tent regularity in the con&s;titution?</P>
<P>IT ought to be con&s;idered yet farther, if Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;ent to the Colonies with the&s;e re&s;trained powers, whether unde&s;irable con&s;equences might not be naturally feared, both <HI>here,</HI> and at <HI>home?</HI></P>
<P>WOULD it be unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Bi&s;hops <HI>here</HI> would be di&s;po&s;ed to throw off this re&s;traint as &s;oon as might be? Would it be any other than what has been done a thou&s;and times over, if they &s;hould embrace all opportunities, in the vigorous u&s;e of all likely means to recover
<PB N="147" REF="010853_0146_0F85226E33C20FA0">
the&s;e appendages to their office they have been de|prived of? Would it not be a good plea in their favour, that they aimed at nothing more, than be|ing upon a par with their brethern in the &s;ame office? Have Bi&s;hops, in the &s;everal pa&s;t ages of the Church, di&s;covered &s;uch want of ambition, and &s;o great a di&s;inclination to the enlargement of their &s;phere of power, as to render it in the lea&s;t degree improbable, that they would act in the manner that has been de&s;cribed? Nay, the Dr. him&s;elf has been &s;o off his guard, as even to &s;ugge&s;t,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 110.</NOTE> that, in time to come, they "may be ve&s;ted with &s;uch a degree of civil power, as may be worthy of their acceptance", and to ju&s;tifie the thing it&s;elf. What he has &s;aid, upon this head, may be con&s;idered in it's proper place.</P>
<P>AND, at <HI>home,</HI> would there be no likelyhood of unea&s;ine&s;s, in con&s;equence of an American Epi&s;|copate upon this plan? Might not the va&s;t num|bers there, who have long complained of the too largely extended power claimed and exerci&s;ed by Bi&s;hops, think them&s;elves hardly treated, that no regard &s;hould be paid to their intreaties, while a comparatively few incon&s;iderable profe&s;&s;ors of the Church of England in America are heard, and an Epi&s;copate &s;ettled for them according to their mind? And would even the Bi&s;hops them&s;elves at home be plea&s;ed with the propo&s;ed limitation of the authority of Bi&s;hops here? Would they not ea&s;ily and naturally argue from what was done in the Colonies, to what might, with as much rea&s;on, be done in England? If Bi&s;hops in Ame|rica may be as faithful in their office, and do their duty as well, without &s;piritual courts and civil
<PB N="148" REF="010853_0147_0F85226EE68A7480">
power, as with them, what need of the&s;e annexed appendages at home? Why may not Bi&s;hops there be as rea&s;onably re&s;trained in their authority, as Bi&s;hops in the Colonies? It can &s;carce be &s;uppo&s;ed it &s;hould e&s;cape the thought of our Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops, that the &s;ettlement of &s;uch an Epi&s;copate in Ame|rica, as is here propo&s;ed, may prepare the way for &s;uch a change in the power of Bi&s;hops at home, as they would not be very fond of.</P>
<P>I SHALL not think it unnece&s;&s;ary, before I leave this objection, to ob&s;erve, that not only the Dr. but the Clergy that de&s;ired him to write, and their &s;uperiors at home al&s;o, &s;eem to be united in the thought, that, if Bi&s;hops are &s;ent to the Colonies, it would be rea&s;onable they &s;hould be &s;uch, as they have de&s;cribed, that is, Bi&s;hops dive&s;ted of all power but that, which they call "purely &s;piritual": Otherwi&s;e, they would not have been at the pains to prepare, and publi&s;h their plan of an American Epi&s;copate. We all as one join with them in this &s;entiment. If Bi&s;hops are &s;ent to the Colonies with civil as well as &s;piritual powers, and claim it as their right to concern them&s;elves here, as they do at home, with the Probate of Wills, letters of Guardian-&s;hip and Admini&s;tration, holding their courts, and acting as judges in matters of this na|ture, it would introduce an e&s;&s;ential change in the &s;ettled con&s;titution of the Colonies upon this head, and vacate all their laws relative thereto. And this is an alteration that would affect all denomi|nations among us, Epi&s;copalians in common with others; in&s;omuch, that they them&s;elves would not de&s;ire Bi&s;hops &s;hould come here ve&s;ted with &s;uch power. It is not &s;uppo&s;ed, there are a &s;core of this denomination, in all the Colonies, who would
<PB N="149" REF="010853_0148_0F852273A6CA9678">
be gratified with &s;o de&s;tructive an e&s;tabli&s;hment. It would, without all controver&s;ie, be the occa&s;ion of univer&s;al confu&s;ion. In&s;tead of that peace and quiet we now enjoy, there would be noi&s;e and clamor, anger, wrath, &s;trife, and all manner of di&s;|traction: E&s;pecially would this be the con&s;e|quence, if the&s;e Bi&s;hops, in the exerci&s;e of their authority, &s;hould interfere with the religious liber|ties and privileges of other denominations. The&s;e their fathers purcha&s;ed for them at a very dear rate, the&s;e they value as their deare&s;t intere&s;t, and, rather than be deprived of them, they would chearfully &s;ubmit to the lo&s;s even of life it&s;elf. It is not therefore imagined by Epi&s;copalians, any more than other denominations, that this kind of Bi&s;hops will be thought proper for the Colonies; nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, they will be ever &s;ent, un|le&s;s a change in the &s;tate of affairs at home &s;hould unhappily take place, that will be as detrimental to them, as it will be to us.</P>
<P>OBJECT. III. The Church of England knows no &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are &s;pecified in this plan, nor can they, in con&s;i&s;tency with it's con&s;titution, be &s;ent to the Colonies. The American Bi&s;hops, &s;ays the Plan, "&s;hall have no authority but purely of a &s;piritual and eccle&s;ia&s;tical nature, &s;uch as is AL|TOGETHER FROM THE CHURCH. NOT FROM THE STATE"; that is, in plain Engli&s;h, they &s;hall have no authority at all as officers in the Church of England.</P>
<P>IF by this "purely &s;piritual authority" is meant, authority that has for it's object ONLY the con|cerns of religion, and the &s;ouls of men, it is ac|knowledged, it may be thus confined. This was
<PB N="150" REF="010853_0149_0F852274A647CE00">
the only authority of Bi&s;hops, whether we under|&s;tand the word in the Epi&s;copalian &s;en&s;e, or our's, in apo&s;tolic times, and afterwards, until Con&s;tan|tine became a chri&s;tian by profe&s;&s;ion. And it would have been happy for the Church of Chri&s;t, if civil power had never been annexed to that office, which has nothing to do but with the &s;pi|ritual intere&s;ts of men. But then, it is to be re|membered, that this authority, at lea&s;t as to it's exerci&s;e in the Church of England, is not ALTO|GETHER FROM THE CHURCH, and NOT FROM THE STATE; nor can this be the ca&s;e, conform|ably to it's pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment. Is not the KING the acknowledged SUPREME HEAD of this Church? Does it own any for Bi&s;hops, or can there be any, without his licence for their election, and nominating the per&s;ons that &s;hall be cho&s;en? And when they have been elected and con&s;ecrated, can they exerci&s;e the lea&s;t authority, even in &s;pi|ritual and eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, but by him, and within the limits that have been pointed out to them by the STATE? Can they vary a title from it's pre&s;cribed orders in any one thing per|taining to the exerci&s;e of authority? Are they not obliged to the u&s;e of tho&s;e forms of prayer, that mode of ordination, and that manner of admi|ni&s;tring the &s;acrament, the STATE has enjoined? Is there any one part of government or di&s;cipline they can depart from, or alter? How then &s;hould their "authority be ALTOGETHER from the CHURCH, not from the STATE"? Can that au|thority, with any &s;hew of rea&s;on, have this affirm|ed of it, which cannot be obtained without the in|tervening plea&s;ure of the KING, and, when ob|tained, cannot be exerci&s;ed but within certain li|mits, which have been a&s;certained by the STATE?
<PB N="151" REF="010853_0150_0F852275A1BC0838">
To &s;peak of that authority as ALTOGETHER from the CHURCH, which is &s;o e&s;&s;entially dependent on the STATE, that it cannot be had but in com|pliance with the laws it has made, nor exerci&s;ed but in conformity to them, is highly incon&s;i&s;tent. It is indeed this dependance on the STATE, not|with&s;tanding the de&s;ired authority ALTOGETHER from the CHURCH, that is the true &s;ource of all the hard&s;hips and grievances, on account of the want of Bi&s;hops in America, that have been &s;o bitterly complained of. Did Bi&s;hops of the Church of England no more depend on the STATE, and no more derive their authority from it, than our mini&s;ters do, the Epi&s;copal Churches here might as well be &s;upplied with Bi&s;hops, as our's are with Pa|&s;tors. What &s;hould hinder? The Apo&s;tles in their day, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors afterwards for many years, were ve&s;ted with &s;piritual powers, and exerci&s;ed them, according to the in&s;titution of Chri&s;t, with|out the intervening help of any civil &s;tate what|ever. And why may not the officers of God's &s;piritual kingdom now be ve&s;ted with like powers, and go on in the exerci&s;e of them, in the &s;ame way? Our Epi&s;copalian Coloni&s;ts make &s;ome pretences to this, while they &s;ay, the Bi&s;hops they propo&s;e &s;hould be &s;ent to America "&s;hall have no authority but &s;uch as is ALTOGETHER FROM THE CHURCH"; but what a vain pretence is this? How ab&s;urd? when they know that Bi&s;hops can have no authority in the Church of England, but from the STATE? If they may be ve&s;ted with authority, it cannot be exerci&s;ed, as officers in this Church, but from the KING, and ALTOGETHER conformably to the ORDERS of the STATE. If it had been only &s;aid, the Colony-Bi&s;hops &s;hall have no other than <HI>purely &s;piritual</HI> authority, nor exerci&s;e any other, this
<PB N="152" REF="010853_0151_0F85227EC434D7E0">
would have been intelligible and con&s;i&s;tent; but to propo&s;e that they &s;hould have this authori|ty not at all from the STATE, as mu&s;t be the ca&s;e if it is ALTOGEHER FROM THE CHURCH, is to propo&s;e that which is incompatible with the KING's SUPREMACY in all &s;piritual and eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal matters, and &s;ubver&s;ive of that STATE-POWER, by which the Church of England has been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. It cannot therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed, but that this part of the plan &s;hould be rejected, both by the King and Parliament.</P>
<P>OBJECT. IV. We are, in principle, again&s;t all civil e&s;tabli&s;hments in religion; and as we do not de&s;ire any &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment in &s;upport of our own religious &s;entiments, or practice, we cannot rea&s;onably be blamed, if we are not di&s;po&s;ed to encourage one in favor of the Epi&s;copal-Coloni&s;ts. We profe&s;s to "fear God, and honor the King"; declaring our readine&s;s to obey, in &s;ubordination to the allegience we owe to him who has been con&s;tituted "Head over all things", the "powers ordained of God" to bear rule over us. We ac|knowledge, with humble gratitude, the favor of our rightful Sovereign, in allowing us the enjoy|ment of tho&s;e "liberties, wherewith Chri&s;t has made his di&s;ciples free"; though we judge, at the &s;ame time, and upon &s;olid rea&s;on, as we imagine, that we have a ju&s;t right to think for our &s;elves in matters of religion, and, in con&s;equence of this right, to wor&s;hip God in that way, which, we ap|prehend, will be mo&s;t acceptable to him; and while we do this, "leading quiet and peaceable lives, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty", we think far|ther, we have a claim to the protection of the State, and the benefit of tho&s;e laws it has made, or
<PB N="153" REF="010853_0152_0F85227F770F69C8">
rea&s;onably may make, for the &s;ecurity of it's loyal &s;ubjects in the exerci&s;e of their rights and liber|ties, whether civil or religious. But we de&s;ire not, and &s;uppo&s;e we have no right to de&s;ire, the inter|po&s;ition of the &s;tate to e&s;tabli&s;h our &s;entiments in religion, or the manner in which we would expre&s;s them. And, as we do not de&s;ire this for our &s;elves, it would be hard to expect we &s;hould de&s;ire it in behalf of others. It does not indeed appear to us, that God has entru&s;ted the &s;tate with a right to make religious e&s;tabli&s;hments. If the &s;tate in England has this delegated authority, mu&s;t it not be owned, that the &s;tate in China, in Turkey, in Spain, has this authority al&s;o? What &s;hould make the difference, in the eye of true rea&s;on? Hath the &s;tate in England been di&s;tingui&s;hed by heaven by any peculiar grant, beyond the &s;tate in other Coun|tries? If it has, let the grant be produced. If it has not, all &s;tates have, in common, the &s;ame au|thority. And as they mu&s;t &s;everally be &s;uppo&s;ed to exert this authority in e&s;tabli&s;hments conform|able to their own &s;entiments in religion; what can the con&s;equence be, but infinite damage to the cau&s;e of God and true religion? And &s;uch in fact has been the con&s;equence of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments in all ages, and in all places. What ab&s;urdities in &s;entiment, and ridiculous follies, not to &s;ay gro&s;s immoralities, in practice, have not been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the civil power in &s;ome or other of the nations of the earth? When in chri&s;tian Countries, &s;o call|ed, has not that been e&s;tabli&s;hed for the religion of Je&s;us, which, for the greater part by far, palpably contradicted the principles of common &s;en&s;e? Has not a power been religiou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;hed in oppo&s;i|tion to Chri&s;t, that has exalted it&s;elf "above all that is called God", and that has filled the earth
<PB N="154" REF="010853_0153_0F852282A3AD77F8">
with the blood of tho&s;e, who cho&s;e death, in the mo&s;t hideou&s;ly contrived forms, rather than to pay homage to &s;uch an idol of fal&s;e wor&s;hip? Yea, in England it&s;elf, has not the religion of Chri&s;t, under popi&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hments, been deba&s;ed, corrupted, and turned into a meer farce? And, &s;ince the re|formation, what has been &s;o great an ob&s;tacle to Go&s;pel-&s;implicity and purity of wor&s;hip, as that e&s;tabli&s;hment, which, having once obtained, the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;onings, and mo&s;t earne&s;t intreaties, have not availed to effect an alteration in it, not &s;o much as in acknowledged exceptionable articles? We are not convinced, that religious e&s;tabli&s;h|ments are at all adapted to &s;erve the cau&s;e of truth and virtue; but are rather per&s;uaded, they have been, and ever will be, greatly detrimental to the prevalence of real genuine Chri&s;tianity. And as the American Colonies, at lea&s;t many of them, are, at pre&s;ent, free from difficulties and embara&s;ments by means of &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments, we cannot but hope they will always remain &s;o. It ought not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that tho&s;e Colonies &s;hould be fond of an e&s;tabli&s;hed Epi&s;copate, which were &s;ettled by &s;uch as were driven from their native land by the oppre&s;&s;ive exerci&s;e of Prelatical power. We &s;hould expre&s;s but little regard to the memory of our Progenitors, and le&s;s gratitude for their pious care, in oppo&s;ition to heavier tryals, and greater hard&s;hips, than we can now ea&s;ily conceive of, to tran&s;mit religion to us free from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> yokes of bon|dage, if we &s;hould encourage the e&s;tabli&s;hment of that very power which was &s;o injuriou&s;ly harra&s;&s;ing to them, and may in time be &s;o to us.</P>
<P>OBJECT. V. The Church of England in the Colonies, in it's comparative low &s;tate, in&s;tead of an
<PB N="155" REF="010853_0154_0F8522835CA7A1E0">
Epi&s;copate, upon this plan, or any other, needs rather the charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of it's friends to &s;upport it's pre&s;ent mini&s;ters, and others that are &s;till wanted. In North-Carolina, the religious &s;tate of things, by all accounts, is deplorably &s;ad. The public wor&s;hip of God, in any form, is &s;trangely neglected; and they have few, very few, mini&s;ters to officiate in go&s;pel-admini&s;trations. That chari|ty, which might be &s;ufficient for the maintenance of as many Mi&s;&s;ionaries as would be needful there, would be &s;wallowed up by one Bi&s;hop only. And would this &s;o much tend to the honor of God, and the good of &s;ouls, as if it was expended in &s;upport of Mi&s;&s;ions that are really nece&s;&s;ary? I &s;hall only &s;ay of Virginia, and Maryland, that it can do them no harm, if we heartily wi&s;h, that a better and more general regard was paid there to the in&s;titutions of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. As to the other Colonies, extending from Pen&s;ylvania to the northernmo&s;t bounds of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Province, notwith&s;tanding the pious care of the Society at home, and the va&s;t charity they have annually been expending in fa|vor of the Church of England, from their fir&s;t in|corporation to this day, it has grown but little in compari&s;on with the other denominations of chri&s;ti|ans, not having got as yet beyond it's infant &s;tate. Perhaps, there are not more Epi&s;copal Churches in the&s;e Colonies, than there have been thou&s;ands of pounds &s;terling expended towards bringing them into exi&s;tence; and they are, by far the greater part of them, in &s;o weak and low a &s;tate, that there would be no hope of their continuance in being, if that charity was with-held, which, at fir&s;t, gave it to them: Whereas, the Churches of other denominations, without any charitable help from home, or el&s;ewhere, are become a great mul|titude,
<PB N="156" REF="010853_0155_0F852283EAEF2278">
rapidly increa&s;ing in all parts of the Coun|try, in the &s;ame proportion beyond the Epi&s;copal Churches, as they have all along done from the beginning, At the large&s;t computation, there are not more than twenty &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and Epi&s;|copalians in the&s;e &s;even Colonies, which contain the greate&s;t number of inhabitants on the Ameri|can Continent; and of the&s;e, it would be no wrong to the truth if it &s;hould be &s;aid, a very con&s;idera|ble part went over to the Church, not &s;o much upon &s;ober inquiry and real principle, as from di&s;|gu&s;t at their Pari&s;h-mini&s;ter, or unhappy prejudices ari&s;ing from the placing of a Meeting-hou&s;e, or &s;ome &s;uch important difficulty in the towns where they lived. In this view of the matter, which is certainly a ju&s;t and true one, what occa&s;ion is there for the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops? E&s;pecially, as their au|thority is not to extend to the Epi&s;copal Laity. Would it not an&s;wer much better ends, to be&s;tow that charity it will require to &s;upport Bi&s;hops, in providing for tho&s;e Churches that mu&s;t come to nothing, if they are not &s;upported in this way?</P>
<P>IT may be worthy of &s;pecial notice here, one great complaint in behalf of the Epi&s;copal Churches is, that numbers of them are de&s;titute of mini&s;ters. This want of mini&s;ters cannot with more truth and ju&s;tice be attributed to any cau&s;e, than the want of money for the &s;upport of more mi&s;&s;ions. The Society at home, the grand &s;ource of charitable help, have &s;een fit, of late years, to le&s;&s;en their grants in &s;upport of their Mi&s;&s;ionaries, for no other rea&s;on, it is pre&s;umed, than their inability to make larger ones; and to the &s;ame inability it is, we believe, chiefly owing, that there are no mi&s;&s;ions in the places where they are wanted. And, as
<PB N="157" REF="010853_0156_0F852284B8AB3F78">
this is the ca&s;e, is it prudent to de&s;ire an Epi&s;copate, which will be attended with a va&s;t charge, which mu&s;t be defrayed &s;ome way or other? It &s;hould &s;eem as though it would be time enough to de&s;ire Bi&s;hops, when the Church is able to &s;tand upon it's own legs, and to &s;upport it's own inferior Cler|gy, as well as &s;uch &s;uperior officers as Bi&s;hops. Things are not ripe, as yet, for an Epi&s;copate. The Church mu&s;t get &s;tronger footing in the Co|lonies before this may rea&s;onably be thought of; and there is no probable way, in which it, can at|tain to this &s;trength, but by employing all the pi|ous charity that can be collected for the better &s;upporting the pre&s;ent Mi&s;&s;ions, and providing for &s;till more: Though after all, it is very que&s;ti|onable, whether, even with this help, the Church will &s;oon arrive at &s;uch a &s;tate of maturity, as to make it worth while for a Bi&s;hop to come here.</P>
<P>OTHER objections we have to make again&s;t the plan that has been propo&s;ed; but as they co-incide with what has been powerfully offered by the late excellent Dr. Mayhew, I &s;hall take the liberty to in&s;ert his objections at large. And there may be a &s;pecial propriety in this, not only as we e&s;teem them highly pertinent, and indi&s;putably valid; but as they were wrote in an&s;wer to this very plan, which, though exhibited by one "who is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an high dignitary of the Church", and de|clared, by our author, to be &s;o harmle&s;s, in every re&s;pect, that no rea&s;onable objections can be offer|ed again&s;t it", he has yet &s;uffered to lie expo&s;ed to all the Dr. has &s;aid again&s;t it, not having li&s;ped a word in reply to him.</P>
<P>BUT, before I pre&s;ent the reader, with what Dr. Mayhew has &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, I would briefly
<PB N="158" REF="010853_0157_0F8522856376E350">
&s;ugge&s;t one thing, as an expedient well adapted to com-promi&s;e matters between Epi&s;copalians, and other Denominations, in the Colonies, and unite them all in love and peace. It is this; that the King and Parliament, who ve&s;ted Bi&s;hops at <HI>home</HI> with governing and ordaining power in the Church of England, may, if in their wi&s;dom they think fit, lodge the &s;ame power with Pre&s;byters <HI>here.</HI> And &s;hould they plea&s;e to do this, it would in&s;tantly put an end to the complaint for want of governing and ordaining authority in America. There would now be no need of Bi&s;hops, as Pre&s;byters might, with as much valid propriety, govern and ordain in the Colonies, as Bi&s;hops in England. For, let it be particularly noticed, what is now &s;ugge&s;ted is perfectly agreeable to the principles of the fir&s;t founders of the reformed Church of England. Governing and ordaining power was not given to Bi&s;hops, becau&s;e it was thought they were an or|der of officers &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters by DIVINE RIGHT. It was &s;uppo&s;ed, that all powers in &s;piri|tual and eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, as well as temporal, was ve&s;ted in the KING, who might communicate it to what &s;ubordinate mini&s;ters he plea&s;ed. It was upon this principle, that the power of ORDI|NATION was once delegated to Cromwel, a LAYMAN, as the King's vice-gerent; who, in virtue of the King's acknowledged &s;upremacy, had then as full legal authority to ordain as any Bi&s;hop in the kingdom. Upon this &s;ame principle, <Q>Cranmer, Arch-Bi&s;hop of Canterbury, Bonner, Bi&s;hop of Lon|don, &amp;c. took out commi&s;&s;ions from the Crown, importing, that, becau&s;e the vicegerent (Crom|wel, a lay per&s;on) could not per&s;onally attend the charge in all parts of the kingdom, the King authori&s;es the Bi&s;hop in his (the King's) &s;tead to

ordain, within his Dioce&s;s, &s;uch as he judged worthy of holy orders; to collate to benefices; to give in&s;titution; and to execute all other parts of the Epi&s;copal authority; and this dur|ing the King's plea&s;ure only.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid.

And that this really is the ca&s;e as to <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical orders</HI> conferred by our PRESENT Bi&s;hops, that all the validity, &s;ignificancy or weight which they have in <HI>this</HI> Church, they derive <HI>purely</HI> and <HI>&s;olely</HI> from the authority of the MAGISTRATE, inconte&s;tibly appears from hence; namely, that the magi&s;trate has <HI>autho|ritatively</HI> directed and pre&s;cribed HOW and TO WHOM, <HI>ordination</HI> is to be given. And &s;hould an ordination be given by all the Bi&s;hops in this Church in OTHER manner, &amp; OTHER form, than that pre&s;cribed by the magi&s;trate, <HI>&s;uch ordina|tion</HI> would be of no legality at all, nor authority in <HI>this</HI> Church.

Have we &s;ufficient ground to think that they and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors would, to the day of doom, or for a long time, remain contented with &s;uch powers, or under &s;uch limitations? in a word, that they would continue &s;uch inoffen&s;ive, harmle&s;s creatures, as this gentleman &s;uppo&s;es; only diffu&s;ing <HI>ble&s;&s;ings</HI> around them, on all manner of people <HI>&s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch holy impre&s;&s;ions</HI> as are made by their <HI>hands</HI> on the good people in Eng|land; &s;o that we can rea&s;onably apprehend no mi&s;|chief from them? Has this order of men been remarkable for a quiet, inoffen&s;ive behaviour?

The&s;e are good words, and fair &s;peeches; nor do I doubt, but that the gentleman &s;peaks his real &s;entiments. But &s;uppo&s;ing all this; taking it al&s;o for granted, that in the <HI>pre&s;ent admini&s;tration,</HI> there has been a di&s;covery of &s;o much wi&s;dom and integrity, of &s;uch a great regard to the <HI>liberties</HI> and <HI>priviledges</HI> of the &s;ubject, and, particularly, of <HI>&s;uch a tender concern for the intere&s;t and pro&s;perity of his Maje&s;ty's American colonies,</HI> as leaves us no room to fear an <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive enlargement of &s;piritual,</HI> or <HI>any other power,</HI> during the continuance of it: All this be|ing taken for granted, yet may not times alter, and admini&s;trations change? Who knows what the next reign and admini&s;tration may be? or whether attempts towards an oppre&s;&s;ive enlargement of power, may not be as much encouraged, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed they would be frowned on, during the pre&s;ent? We are certainly much more &s;ecure a|gain&s;t &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion, in the ab&s;ence of bi&s;hops, than we &s;hould be if they were fixed here. <HI>Ob&s;ta principiis,</HI> was never thought an ill maxim by wi&s;e men. Bi&s;hops being once fixed in America, pretexts might ea&s;ily be found, both for encrea&s;ing their number, and enlarging their powers: And the&s;e pretexts might probably be hearkened to, and prevail, on &s;uch a change of times as may be &s;up|po&s;ed. To &s;ay the lea&s;t, this is much more to be apprehended, than it is, that, on &s;uch a change, bi|&s;hops

<P>THE gentleman con&s;iders as perfectly chimerical, the apprehen&s;ions which I formerly hinted, re&s;pect|ing the inconveniences that might re&s;ult from the appointment of bi&s;hops in America. Particularly, that by the increa&s;e of the epi&s;copal party, they might get a majority in our hou&s;es of a&s;&s;embly; that in con&s;equence thereof the church of England,
<PB N="166" REF="010853_0165_0F85228B721B6868">
might become the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of all the&s;e colonies; that a &s;acramental te&s;t, or &s;omething like it, might en&s;ue, to exclude non-conformi&s;ts from places, preferment, and civil offices <HI>as in England;</HI> and that taxes might be impo&s;ed on us all in com|mon, for the maintenance of the&s;e bi&s;hops, and the epi&s;copal clergy. I did not, however, imagine that the&s;e dangers were very near at hand in New-England; nor do &s;o now, con&s;idering the &s;mall proportion that epi&s;copalians bear to prote&s;tants of other denominations. Should bi&s;hops be &s;ent, and the Society bend its whole force to increa&s;e the church among us, it is not probable that the&s;e e|vents would &s;peedily take place. But even remote evils may be rea&s;onably apprehended, as well as tho&s;e which are imminent; and are to be guarded again&s;t, as much as may be. That appointing bi|&s;hops for America, would be a probable means of increa&s;ing the epi&s;copal party here, will not be de|nied. This is doubtle&s;s one principal rea&s;on, why it is &s;o much de&s;ired; tho' neither this gentleman, nor the Society, &s;o far as I can at pre&s;ent recollect, has particularly mentioned it. There is how|ever, &s;omething which looks a little this way in the <HI>Ab&s;tract</HI> before-cited, wherein the rea|&s;ons for bi&s;hops here are enumerated; one of which is, <Q>to confirm <HI>new converts</HI> from <HI>&s;chi&s;m</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ab&s;tract,</HI> 1715. p. 54.</NOTE>.</Q> But even &s;uppo&s;ing a majority of epi&s;copalians in the legi&s;lative body, in any [<HI>I mu&s;t not &s;ay</HI> either, <HI>becau&s;e there are more than</HI> two] of the&s;e colonies, the gentleman a&s;ks, <Q>Why &s;hould a te&s;t law follow?

The very <HI>Candid Examiner</HI> of my <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> plainly enough intimated his de&s;ire of &s;uch a law here.

Nor am I able to &s;ee any ground for the gentle|man's great confidence, that the King would not be advi&s;ed to allow that te&s;t; &s;eeing there is &s;uch a one in our mother-country. I pre&s;ume, the gentleman could a&s;&s;ign no &s;olid rea&s;on for a te&s;t-law in England, by which <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> di&s;&s;enters are excluded from offices there, which would not hold good in favour of a law of the &s;ame tenor here; I mean on the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch an increa&s;e and majority of the epi&s;copal party. Can what is &s;up|po&s;ed rea&s;onable and equitable in Old England, be &s;uppo&s;ed unrea&s;onable and injurious in New? Or is it to be imagined, that the Head of the church of England would, at the de&s;ire of the legi&s;lative body in any of his colonies, refu&s;e to allow of laws for e&s;tabli&s;hing that church therein, and for introducing a te&s;t? laws manife&s;tly adapted to the worldly grandeur, if not to the &s;piritual good of that church, which is as it were <HI>his body;</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="010853_0167_0F85228CE29AE6E8">

<P>HE treats as &s;till more wild and chimerical, the &s;uppo&s;ition of our ever being taxed in common, for the &s;upport of bi&s;hops and their clergy. Says he, <Q>The terror of being taxed for bi&s;hops, &amp;c.&mdash;is yet <HI>more chimerical</HI> than the former<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 63.</NOTE>.</Q> But in ca&s;e of &s;uch an increa&s;e of the epi&s;copal party, of the government's coming into their hands, and of the church of England's being here e&s;tabli&s;hed by a provincial law, which things mu&s;t be pre&s;up|po&s;ed; where is the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch an apprehen|&s;ion? I can &s;ee none, except it lies in the <HI>injurious</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive</HI> nature of &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ed tax: But this con&s;ideration will never prevent the doubts and fears of tho&s;e, who reflect on what has been done in almo&s;t every age and country in chri&s;ten|dom, by the prevailing religious party, for their own ea&s;e, and the further weakening and vexing the minority. The gentleman ob&s;erves, that <Q>tithes are paid in England to the clergy by virtue of grants, which laid that burthen upon e&s;tates many ages before the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors enjoyed them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</Q> i. e. in the days of popery.

his victory in this re&s;pect, he immediately begins his triumph, by &s;aying: <Q>With what <HI>mo|de&s;ty</HI> then can the Doctor &s;ugge&s;t, that &s;uch a thing might be feared in New-England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 64.</NOTE>?</Q> I am very glad if the governing part of the nation have &s;o much moderation re&s;pecting prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters, that &s;uch an act could not now be obtain|ed there; which might, as it appears to me, be ju&s;tly looked on as a great hard&s;hip, or in&s;tance of oppre&s;&s;ion. It may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, this gentleman is of the &s;ame opinion: Why el&s;e could not an act of that nature be now obtained, if the hierarchy were not already pro|vided for, by virtue of grants, when Popery was triumphant, which laid the <HI>burthen</HI> of tythes on e&s;tates? But I do not pretend to have a thorough under&s;tanding of the <HI>doctrine</HI> of tythes, as <HI>profe&s;&s;ed</HI> and <HI>preached</HI> in the church of England; never having made this any, much le&s;s a principal part of <HI>my &s;tudy,</HI> however important an <HI>article</HI> it may be.</P>
<P>BE this matter as it may, while there is a law in force, which bears &s;o hard on prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters, as the te&s;t does, I &s;hall not ea&s;ily be per&s;waded, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible if the hierarchy was not already provided for, to obtain an act for that purpo&s;e, by which the burthen &s;hould be laid up|on di&s;&s;enters in common with others; which, in &s;ome re&s;pects, might be thought a le&s;s grievance than the other: Particularly as it would be much le&s;s <HI>reproachful</HI> and <HI>ignominious</HI> to them, to be only obliged to pay to the &s;upport of a clergy di&s;approv|ed by them, than to be treated as if they did not merit the character, and were therefore unworthy to enjoy the privileges of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; though

The Society will probably think, this burthen &s;hould not lie upon them; as they are not able to &s;upport a &s;ufficient number of mi&s;&s;ions among peo|ple, who&s;e nece&s;&s;ities are great and urgent. Is it like|ly then, that the Briti&s;h nation, &s;o deeply plunged in debt, and in which there is &s;carce a po&s;&s;ibility of laying any new taxes, will undertake to maintain bi&s;hops for America? No &s;urely. Will the bi&s;hops and rich clergy in England do it <HI>out of their abun|dance?</HI> This is at lea&s;t as improbable; e&s;pecially &s;ince it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that many of them cannot, to this day, be intirely per&s;waded, but that it is rather <HI>more ble&s;&s;ed to</HI> receive <HI>than to</HI> give. Will American bi&s;hops then, tru&s;t to the genero&s;ity of the people here; depending upon <HI>providence</HI> and <HI>alms,</HI> or, in other words, upon the good will of the Americans?

The church of England had an exclu&s;ive legal e&s;tabli&s;hment, at the time &s;poken of; the King for her Head, and &s;worn Protector, and almo&s;t all per&s;ons of intere&s;t and power for her members. Conformity was almo&s;t, if not the only path to pre|ferment, civil honours, offices and emoluments. In &s;hort, the con&s;titution both in church and &s;tate was &s;o &s;ecured, &s;o guarded both by laws and mem|bers, and non-conformi&s;ts were &s;o few, and under &s;uch di&s;advantages, that there was not room for any fear that they would ever increa&s;e &s;o as to be|come the major and leading part in parliament, or be able, if they de&s;ired it, to over-turn the e&s;tab|li&s;hment, and oppre&s;s epi&s;copalians.

We are not an independent people, or &s;overeign &s;tate, but dependent on England, wherein epi&s;copacy is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and which we honor and obey, as our mother-country. Our Governor and all provin|cial Governors appointed by the crown, I &s;uppo&s;e are, and by law mu&s;t be, conformi&s;ts to the church of England. A con&s;iderable number of per&s;ons, even in the N. England colonies, are per&s;ons of much wealth, influence and power. In mo&s;t of the colonies the re&s;pective Governors have all military offices at their free di&s;po&s;al, and the nomination to civil; and in &s;ome, a negative on the choice of coun|&s;ellors. They mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;uppo&s;ed, as a thing of cour&s;e, mo&s;t to favour epi&s;copalians; &s;o that conformity, in&s;tead of being a bar to preferment here, is perhaps generally found the readie&s;t way to it. Epi&s;copalians may be, and often are, cho&s;en members of both hou&s;es of a&s;&s;embly in the colo|nies of New-England; nor is there either law, or any thing el&s;e, to prevent this, if, by their qualifi|cations and good behaviour, they can recommend them&s;elves to the electors. And I hope this gen|tleman would not have the people <HI>obliged</HI> by law to chu&s;e them, whether they approve of them or not; though this &s;eems to be the amount of what he &s;omewhere &s;ays. Be&s;ides, the epi&s;copalians here are more united among them&s;elves than we are, being of different &s;ects and parties. And &s;hould they [the epi&s;copalians] hereafter approach any

<P>OUR circum&s;tances being &s;uch, is there not a hundred, a thou&s;and times, more rea&s;on to appre|hend that epi&s;copalians may in time become the major and governing party here, and enact &s;uch laws as I have been &s;peaking of, than there was at the <HI>revolution,</HI> that the non-conformi&s;ts in Eng|land might do the like there?

The prin|ciple I intend, is this: That <Q>all members of every church are, according to the principles of liberty, intitled to <HI>every part</HI> of what they conceive to be the benefits of it, intire and compleat, <HI>&s;o far as con&s;i&s;ts with the welfare of civil government</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 59.</NOTE>.</Q> It is readily owned, that our apprehen&s;ion of what may po&s;&s;ibly or probably be the con&s;equence of bi&s;hops being &s;ent hither, ought not to put us on infringing the <HI>religious liberty</HI> of our fellow &s;ub|jects, and <HI>chri&s;tian brethren,</HI> if they will pardon
<PB N="175" REF="010853_0174_0F852295E559EF78">
this freedom: Neither have we any power to do &s;o, if we were unrea&s;onable and wicked enough to to de&s;ire it; <HI>our charter</HI> granting &s;uch liberty to <HI>all prote&s;tants.</HI> But the epi&s;copalians here may enjoy this liberty, as they now do, without bi&s;hops in America, though under &s;ome inconveniences; principally perhaps, for want of <HI>holy impre&s;&s;ions</HI> made by their <HI>hands</HI> in the ceremony of confirma|tion; their <HI>lack</HI> of which it mu&s;t be owned, is &s;ometimes but too vi&s;ible in their <HI>behaviour.</HI> We are therefore, methinks, very excu&s;able, if we expre&s;s a <HI>reluctance</HI> at the propo&s;al of a &s;cheme, which we really apprehend may bring great trou|ble and temporal inconveniences upon us; and be the &s;ource of much divi&s;ion, di&s;cord and confu&s;ion: E&s;pecially, if it be al&s;o a &s;cheme tending to pro|mote that particular mode or profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;ti|anity among us, which we cannot but think, on the whole, much le&s;s conformable to the go&s;pel, and therefore le&s;s conducive to the eternal happine&s;s of mankind, than that which at pre&s;ent generally prevails among us.</P>
<P>BUT one thing mentioned by this gentleman, in order to reconcile us to this &s;cheme, had almo&s;t e&s;caped me. It is this. '<HI>Popi&s;h bi&s;hops</HI> re&s;ide <HI>here,</HI>' &s;ays he, 'and go about to exerci&s;e <HI>every part</HI> of their function, without offence and without ob&s;ervati|on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 66.</NOTE>.' But this has a much le&s;s tendency to re|concile us to the propo&s;al about American bi&s;hops, than to give us an alarm for the welfare of our mother country; with which, we are very &s;en&s;ible, our own is connected. If popi&s;h bi&s;hops exerci&s;e their function in England <HI>without ob&s;ervation,</HI> as the gentleman &s;ays, it is not indeed &s;trange, if they
<PB N="176" REF="010853_0175_0F852296AD165BC0">
do it al&s;o <HI>without offence.</HI> But I cannot readily comprehend what he means by &s;aying, that they do this <HI>without ob&s;ervation,</HI> when at the &s;ame time he &s;peaks of it as a notorious fact: Though his meaning cannot be mi&s;taken, when he &s;ays, this is done <HI>without offence.</HI> It mu&s;t be, that it gives no con&s;iderable umbrage or jealou&s;y, but that the people, at lea&s;t <HI>tho&s;e of higher rank,</HI> are contented it &s;hould be &s;o. For he &s;peaks of this as an in|&s;tance and proof of the mutual candor, forbear|ance and moderation, which prevail at this day in England, among chri&s;tians of different denomi|nations; and &s;o, as a rea&s;on why we &s;hould be well &s;atisfyed with having bi&s;hops of the church of England in the&s;e parts. But if this proves any thing, it proves too much; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that we &s;hould be content to &s;ee, not only Engli&s;h, but Popi&s;h bi&s;hops, freely exerci&s;ing their functions among us; the latter of which is not agreeable to our charter and laws. And though I am a warm friend to re|ligious liberty in the large&s;t &s;en&s;e; and tho' mutual forbearance cannot be too much recommended, where the differences are <HI>merely</HI> of a <HI>religious</HI> nature, or &s;uch as do not affect the liberty, &s;afety and natural rights of mankind; yet I mu&s;t own, I hope never to &s;ee popi&s;h bi&s;hops thus going about <HI>without of|fence,</HI> in New-England; being per&s;waded, from the very nature of divers popi&s;h tenets, that roman catholics cannot be <HI>&s;afely</HI> tolerated in the free ex|erci&s;e of their religion, in a prote&s;tant government.</P>
<P>I HAVE freely explained my&s;elf as to the pro|po&s;ition concerning bi&s;hops in America; and though not &s;o fully, yet more particularly than I intended to do; having been almo&s;t compelled to it, at once by this gentleman's formal attack upon

However, I think it but ju&s;tice to him to acknowledge, that if &s;uch a &s;cheme as he has propo&s;ed were to be put in execution, and <HI>only</HI> &s;uch con&s;equences were to follow, as he <HI>pro|fe&s;&s;edly</HI> has in view, as the ends aimed at, I could not object again&s;t it; except only upon the &s;ame principle, that I object again&s;t the church of Eng|land <HI>in general,</HI> and &s;hould be &s;orry, from a regard to what I &s;uppo&s;e a more &s;criptural way of wor&s;hip,

Thus far I have the honor fully to agree with this gentleman". Thus Dr. Mayhew.</P>
<P>IT is evident, by this time, that "objections can be offered again&s;t &s;uch a plan" as has been pro|po&s;ed. Whether the Dr. or tho&s;e who employed him to write, will e&s;teem them "rea&s;onable", time may di&s;cover.

<P>HAD the Dr. after he had opened the plan for the intended Epi&s;copate, pointed out particularly it's rea&s;onablene&s;s in it&s;elf, it's con&s;i&s;tency with the e&s;tab|li&s;hment at home, and the RIGHT Epi&s;copalians have to &s;uch a con&s;titution in the Colonies, he had done &s;omething to good purpo&s;e; but, in&s;tead of this, he appears in the gui&s;e of a confe&s;&s;or, and gravely a&s;ks, "what rea&s;onable objections can be offered again&s;t &s;uch a plan as this, &s;o univer&s;ally harmle&s;s in every re&s;pect?&mdash;Can any thing be promoted by it, but the good of the Church? Can any thing be objected again&s;t it, but that this will be pre|vented? Will any dare, in this age of Briti&s;h free|dom, to avow the objection?

Surely, he could not ima|gine, that any man of good under&s;tanding would be otherwi&s;e moved by them, than to wonder he &s;hould only harangue, when it was his bu&s;ine&s;s to argue.</P>
<P>HE goes on with placing again before our view the bugbear of per&s;ecution. If they cannot have an Epi&s;copate, they are puni&s;hed; and to be puni&s;hed for their religious principles is per&s;ecution in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e. Says he, "will it be &s;aid, that the prevention of an Epi&s;copate in America is no pu|ni&s;hment? It may as well be &s;aid, that keeping a man out of HIS RIGHT is no inju&s;tice". The Co|loni&s;ts then, who wor&s;hip God according to the mode of the Church of England, have a RIGHT to an Epi&s;copate; and to prevent their enjoyment of this "invaluable right" is to puni&s;h them, and thus to puni&s;h them is, in "the propere&s;t &s;en&s;e", to per&s;ecute them. Let me make a pau&s;e here, and a&s;k, on what do they found this pretended RIGHT? How came they by it? Should it be &s;aid, we claim liberty of con&s;cience, and fully enjoy it. And why would we confine this privilege to our|&s;elves? Is it not as rea&s;onable, Epi&s;copalians &s;hould both claim and enjoy it? It is readily allowed; and we are as willing they &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s and exerci&s;e religious liberty in it's full extent, as we de&s;ire to do it our&s;elves. But then, let it be heedfully minded, we claim no RIGHT to de&s;ire the inter|po&s;ition of the STATE to ESABLISH that mode of wor&s;hip, government, or di&s;cipline, we apprehend
<PB N="180" REF="010853_0179_0F852299A3CC5A38">
is mo&s;t agreable to the mind of Chri&s;t. We de|&s;ire no other liberty, than to be left unre&s;trained in the exerci&s;e of our religious principles, in &s;o far as we are good members of &s;ociety. And we are perfectly willing Epi&s;copalians &s;hould enjoy this liberty to the full. If they think Bi&s;hops, in their appropriated &s;en&s;e, were con&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, or his apo&s;tles, we object not a word again&s;t their having as many of them as they plea&s;e, if they will be content to have them with authority ALTOGE|THER derived from Chri&s;t. But they both claim and de&s;ire, a great deal more. They want to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by having Bi&s;hops upon the footing of a STATE-ESTABLISHMENT. Was this a RIGHT the apo&s;tles claimed, or any of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the uncorrupt ages of the Church? Is this a right that Chri&s;t has ve&s;ted in any profe&s;&s;ors of his reli|gion, much le&s;s in &s;ome, as contra-di&s;tingui&s;hed from others? If Epi&s;copalians have a RIGHT to a civil e&s;tabli&s;hment in their favor, the other deno|minations in the Colonies have, in TRUE REASON, as good a right; and may, with as much ju&s;tice, complain of per&s;ecution, if it is not granted to them. The plain truth is, by the Go&s;pel-charter all profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians are ve&s;ted with preci&s;ely the &s;ame rights; nor has one denomination any more a right to the interpo&s;ition of the civil magi&s;trate, in their favor, than another; and wherever this difference takes place, it is be&s;ide the rule of SCRIP|TURE, and, I may &s;ay al&s;o, the genuine dictates of UNCORRUPTED REASON. If Epi&s;copalians would re&s;t &s;atisfied, as the other denominations do, with what they apprehend to be PURELY SCRIPTURAL mini&s;ters, they would be perfectly upon a par with them, as to the enjoyment of religious liberty in it's fulle&s;t extent: But, if they mu&s;t have what
<PB N="181" REF="010853_0180_0F85229A64B873A0">
they call the&s;e &s;criptural mini&s;ters upon a STATE-ESTABLISHMENT, they can have no rea&s;on to com|plain, unle&s;s of them&s;elves, if they do not enjoy that liberty which others do; not becau&s;e they are more favored or di&s;tingui&s;hed, but becau&s;e they claim no other religious liberty, than what is grant|ed in the Go&s;pel-charter. The &s;hort of the matter is, if the Epi&s;copalians in the Colonies are per&s;e|cuted, while they cannot obtain &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as they de&s;ire, their own de&s;ires are their ONLY per&s;ecutors; unle&s;s they will &s;ay they are per&s;e|cuted by the KING, or PARLIAMENT, or BOTH, to whom &s;olely it belongs to give them what they de&s;ire: And if they &s;hould not be plea&s;ed to do this, it may be ju&s;tly "doubted", as they are cer|tainly "armed with power", whether they would be "di&s;po&s;ed to bring them to the &s;take, or gibbet".</P>
<P>IF it is the truth of fact, that the late Dr. Samuel Chandler "gave his con&s;ent to, and approbation of, American Bi&s;hops, in the manner they have been reque&s;ted", we very much wonder at it; and can no otherwi&s;e account for it than by &s;uppo&s;ing, that he was either too complai&s;ant to &s;ome high dignitary of the Church, or did not &s;o carefully attend to the true merits of the ca&s;e as he would have done, had he him&s;elf, or the di&s;&s;enters at home, been more immediately concerned in it.</P>
<P>WHO tho&s;e "&s;ome" are "that would freely join with the Epi&s;copalians in their application for Bi&s;hops, if their a&s;&s;i&s;tance was needed, we know not; but we know of numbers of the Church of England, of good &s;en&s;e and great integrity, who are as truly hearty, as any among us, in their wi&s;hes, that they

may never &s;ee Bi&s;hops in America; as firmly be|lieving it would be a di&s;&s;ervice, in&s;tead of advan|tage, to the intere&s;t of religion, con&s;idering the circum&s;tances of the Colonies.</P>
<P>THE Dr. has nothing farther to &s;ay, in this &s;ection, but to tell us how, "by ca&s;ting his eyes, while writing, upon the public paper of the day, he was &s;truck with a paragraph, &s;aid to be an an|&s;wer from the King of Poland, to the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia", and by making &s;ome remarks upon it. But we are unable, notwith&s;tanding what he has offered, to perceive it's pertinency to the pre&s;ent di&s;pute. We find no fault with the King of Po|land for "binding him&s;elf by oath to maintain and defend the popi&s;h religion, as it was the reli|gion of tho&s;e with whom it lay to make him King; but we think, at the &s;ame time, he was highly blamable, &s;hould it be &s;uppo&s;ed he really believed this to be the true religion, to promi&s;e upon oath, that, in&s;tead of defending, he would per&s;ecute tho&s;e in the Kingdom who were prote&s;tants by principle. Far from applauding his conduct, we have no other opinion of him, in con&s;equence of it, than of Saul, who, under the fal&s;e per&s;ua&s;ion of doing God good &s;ervice, madly per&s;ecuted the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t. And the be&s;t excu&s;e that can be made for him is that, which this Saul, when he came to him&s;elf, made in his own behalf, namely, "that he did it ignorantly"; notwith&s;tanding which, he calls him&s;elf "the chief of &s;inners", for his former folly. We do not believe, that the King of Poland, or any other King on the earth, has a right, either from his oath, or any other way, to per&s;ecute his &s;ubjects for their religious princi|ples: On the contrary, we are fully per&s;uaded,
<PB N="183" REF="010853_0182_0F85229BE24FCC58">
that he ought, &s;o far as the &s;afety of the Govern|ment will allow of it, to protect them all, without di&s;crimination, in that way of wor&s;hipping God, they think will be mo&s;t acceptable to him. We de&s;ire no favor in this kind, in di&s;tinction from the Epi&s;copalians; neither ought they to de&s;ire any in di&s;tinction from us. If they have a right, upon the foot of <HI>&s;cripture</HI> or <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> to de&s;ire Bi|&s;hops upon a STATE-ESTABLISHMENT in order to the exerci&s;e of their religious principles, we have as good a right to de&s;ire Pa&s;tors, in the &s;ame way, for the exerci&s;e of our's; but as we do not de&s;ire this for our&s;elves, they cannot rea&s;onably complain if we do not de&s;ire it for them.</P>

<HEAD>ANSWER to SECTION IX. which pre|tends that the Epi&s;copate propo&s;ed cannot hurt the Di&s;&s;enters, and is free from all rea|&s;onable Objections.</HEAD>
<P>THE Dr. begins this &s;ection with &s;aying, "&s;hould it be pretended, that an American Epi&s;copate would be productive of much clamor and di&s;content in the Colonies, it would be an ill-grounded a&s;&s;ertion". We are of a quite different mind; as knowing it would be the occa&s;ion of great unea&s;ine&s;s to multitudes. But &s;ays the Dr. arguing upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that it would be productive of di&s;content, "why the unea&s;ine&s;s of the members of the Church, <HI>&s;o ju&s;tly founded,</HI> de&s;erves not to be con&s;idered as much as the un|ea&s;ine&s;s of it's enemies, <HI>without any foundation,</HI> will be difficult to &s;hew". It would be difficult upon his repre&s;entation of the ca&s;e. But, by only rever&s;ing it, and hereby exhibiting it's true &s;tate, the difficulty at once vani&s;hes. Epi&s;copalians, as we judge, have no right, in virtue of the Go&s;pel-charter, or any other, to a STATE-ESTABLISH|MENT of Epi&s;copacy in the Colonies; and if they are unea&s;ie for want of it, their unea&s;ine&s;s is "with|out any ju&s;t foundation": Whereas, if they are
<PB N="185" REF="010853_0184_0F8522A067475410">
di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other denominations, by the grant of &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment, the&s;e denominati|ons would have "ju&s;t rea&s;on" for unea&s;ine&s;s on ac|count of this di&s;criminating difference.&mdash;The &s;ug|ge&s;tion that follows, namely, "that di&s;content in the minds of Church-men would not have that dangerous tendency with re&s;pect to the govern|ment, which there is rea&s;on to apprehend of it in the minds of others", is at once ba&s;e and unju&s;t. If he does not know it, we do, that there have been in the bo&s;om of the Church of England, in this Country, red hot Jacobites, who would gladly have overthrown the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Crown, had it been in their power; and if there are any &s;uch Jacobites in the Colonies at pre&s;ent, they belong to that denomination only in who&s;e "minds there is no dangerous di&s;content", unle&s;s it be &s;uppo&s;ed there may be &s;uch among the Ro|man-catholics.</P>
<P>THE Dr. having offered the&s;e few hints, upon &s;uppo&s;ition that the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops would be attended with di&s;content, now goes on to &s;ay, "of any con&s;iderable di&s;content or unea&s;ine&s;s, there is no rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive". And why? It follows, "di&s;&s;enters in this Country have, of late years, greatly come off from their prejudices; and &s;entiments of candor and moderation have vi&s;ibly taken place. And, excepting here and there a hot-heated writer&mdash;we would hope of the di&s;&s;en|ters in America, that they bear no ill-will to the Church, and de&s;ire nothing more than &s;ecurity in the enjoyment of their pre&s;ent advantages". How does this agree with a pa&s;&s;age, in the petition, which was &s;ent to the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge, by the Dr. and the convened body who put him upon
<PB N="186" REF="010853_0185_0F8522A120C4BBA0">
writing? In this petition, &s;peaking of "the di&s;&s;en|ters of all denominations", they &s;ay, "&s;uch is the UNEASINESS not to &s;ay PERVERSENESS of their di&s;po&s;ition, that they are not contented quietly to partake the&s;e immen&s;e privileges, but make it their CONSTANT PRACTICE to TRADUCE and VILIFIE the CHURCH, not even refraining from the STATE under which &s;uch immunities are allowed them". It is not po&s;&s;ible there &s;hould have been this mo&s;t apparent incon&s;i&s;tency between their <HI>appeal</HI> and <HI>petition,</HI> if they had both been wrote under the in|fluence of "&s;implicity and godly &s;incerity", with|out the mixture of "worldly wi&s;dom". Infallibly, the account in the <HI>appeal</HI> is wrong, if that in the <HI>petition</HI> is right, and vice-ver&s;a; for they directly contradict each other.</P>
<P>THE Dr. goes on, "as to other denominations, the &s;ubject has been propo&s;ed to &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of them, who have, with great candor, confe&s;&s;ed, that, as &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as has been reque&s;ted, could have no ill effect upon any, they had no objections to offer". We &s;ay, on the other hand, the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops, upon the propo&s;ed plan, has been mentioned to Epi&s;copalians; and &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;olid, judicious, and wi&s;e among them, have freely expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;approbation of the thing, con&s;idering the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of the Colonies, and as freely declared their wi&s;hes it might not come into event.</P>
<P>IT is farther &s;aid, to &s;hew there could be no rea|&s;on for di&s;content, that "the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops have, for a long cour&s;e of years, exerci&s;ed their authority with &s;o much mildne&s;s, tenderne&s;s and moderation, as &s;carcely to have afforded an in&s;tance of rea&s;on|able
<PB N="187" REF="010853_0186_0F8522A1EC910EC0">
complaint, e&s;pecially to di&s;&s;enters". Their tenderne&s;s and moderation towards the Coloni&s;ts, that are Non-epi&s;copalians, has not of late been remarkably vi&s;ible, &s;hould this have been the ca&s;e in regard of di&s;&s;enters at home. Had they been thus mild, it would have been much to the advan|tage of the infidel-natives here. Many of them, by this time, would probably have been converted to the faith of Chri&s;t, in con&s;equence of the opera|tion of that INCORPORATING-ACT, which, under their benign influence, as we believe, was rendered null and void; and for no other rea&s;on than this, that the work of go&s;peli&s;ing the Indians would not be carried on after the more of the Church of Eng|land, unle&s;s Epi&s;copalians had a hand in it. To the &s;ame mildne&s;s and tenderne&s;s it was owing, that the petition of the Pre&s;byterian Church at New-York for a charter from the King met with the like fate. The account, as tran&s;mitted from a Gentleman in that City, is this. <Q>The Church (Pre&s;byterian) of New-York lately petitioned the King for a Charter. On the 26th of Augu&s;t it was rejected. The gho&s;tly father of London turned &s;ollicitor for the Bigots here, at the board of trade. It was &s;ugge&s;ted, that the grant of this favor would be a breach of the Coronation oath. The trade would not decide upon that argument; but reported, that general policy was again&s;t our having greater privileges, than are allowed by the laws of toleration. We were very moderate in our reque&s;t. It was only to &s;ecure our Church from falling into &s;ecular u&s;es, and pre&s;erve the bones and graves of our fathers from being &s;old. How hard! When Vintners, Sadlers, Taylors, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. are incorporated Companies in London for le&s;s honorable ends!
<PB N="188" REF="010853_0187_0F8522A621C4AB28">
Is this the moderation of the Hierarchy!</Q> If let|ters, from Epi&s;copalians here of private character, and &s;mall importance, could, by being handed to dignitaries at home, avail to &s;uch hurtful purpo&s;es, what might rea&s;onably be expected as the effect of letters from a Bi&s;hop in the Colonies!</P>
<P>AS to the extract from Calvin, the Dr. mu&s;t have in&s;erted it rather for the &s;ake of his name, which he knows is held in great veneration by many in the Country, than from his e&s;teeming him a friend to Epi&s;copacy, in his &s;en&s;e of it. He knows, or might ea&s;ily have known, that he was no greater a friend to it than we are. He has in|deed been often traduced, by Epi&s;copal-writers, as one of the greate&s;t enemies of the Church of Eng|land. Says Dr. Nichols, be&s;ides others I have not room to cite from, "Mr. Calvin, in his letters to &s;ome of his friends, made u&s;e of &s;ome very hard expre&s;&s;ions with relation to the Church of England, which did not &s;o well become the mouth of a di|vine".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Defence of the Doct. and Di&s;cipline of the Church of England, pag. 10.</NOTE> The plain truth is, Calvin was in prin|ciple as real an enemy to the DIVINE right of Bi|&s;hops, as to the divine right of POPES.</P>
<P>THE Dr. goes on, "&s;ome formerly had an a|ver&s;ion to the idea of Bi&s;hops in America, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they mu&s;t become &s;ubject to their authority. But the plan which is now fixed mu&s;t effectually obviate all their objections, and di&s;&s;ipate their fears". It has been largely &s;hewn, that there are objections &s;till, and ju&s;t ground for fear; and &s;uch as Epi&s;copalians will not find it very ea&s;ie to remove. It is added, "our ordinations cannot
<PB N="189" REF="010853_0188_0F8522A6D99DD4B0">
hurt them, any more than their ordinations can injure us.&mdash;And as to &s;uch di&s;cipline and govern|ment as is intended to be exerci&s;ed under an Epi&s;|copate, they will have no rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied therewith, any more than we now have to be di&s;&s;a|tisfied with the di&s;cipline exerci&s;ed by them". The Dr. quite mi&s;takes the true ground of our di&s;&s;atis|faction. It is not SIMPLY the exerci&s;e of any of their religious principles that would give the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, nor yet the exerci&s;e of them under as many PURELY SCRIPTURAL Bi&s;hops as they could wi&s;h to have; but their having Bi&s;hops under a STATE-ESTABLISHMENT which would put them upon a different foot from the other denominati|ons, and, without all doubt, &s;ooner or later, expo&s;e them to many difficulties, and grievous hard&s;hips.</P>
<P>HE &s;ays farther, "we &s;hould have many rea&s;ons to be plea&s;ed with an Epi&s;copate", and mentions two or three by way of &s;pecimen. "Sometimes we have been grieved at &s;eeing the ill-behavior of a Clergyman in the orders of our Church; but, by the &s;ettlement of American Bi&s;hops, a remedy will be provided for this di&s;order". They have this remedy already provided at home; and yet, there are more di&s;orderly Clergy-men <HI>there</HI> in pro|portion, than are to be found <HI>here.</HI> And, as this is certainly the truth of fact, it &s;hould &s;eem better to let things remain as they are, than to run the venture of a remedy, which, upon long tryal, has been found not to an&s;wer it's intention. "Some|times we have lamented, that the Bi&s;hops at home, and the Society for the propagation of the go&s;pel, have been impo&s;ed upon by fal&s;e accounts tran&s;|mitted from hence by our American Clergy; but under an Epi&s;copate, we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible there
<PB N="190" REF="010853_0189_0F8522A85AD35328">
can be no opportunity for any gro&s;s impo&s;itions of this nature". There has been, and now is, op|portunity for impo&s;itions in this kind at <HI>home,</HI> where there are Bi&s;hops in plenty; and here would be much more opportunity for it <HI>here</HI> as Bi&s;hops in America would be &s;o va&s;tly di&s;tant from mo&s;t of the Clergy under their care. It would be ea&s;ier to impo&s;e upon them by wrong accounts <HI>here,</HI> than it is in England. "Sometimes again complaints have been made, that, in con&s;equence of this fal&s;e information, mi&s;&s;ions have been erected in improper places, and the Society's bounty has been mi&s;applied; but of all &s;uch ca&s;es Bi&s;hops in this Country will be competent judges, and no perver&s;ion or abu&s;e of the Society's favors will be &s;uffered to continue". It is not for want of good information, as to the real &s;tate of religion in North Carolina, that it has been &s;o long, and &s;o &s;trangely neglected by the Society; but from a prevailing di&s;po&s;ition to epi&s;copize the more nor|thern Colonies. And &s;hould this be in the view of the Bi&s;hops to be &s;ent, as many improper mi&s;&s;ions, in our e&s;timation, might be erected, or encouraged, as there are now; probably a great many more. We are firmly per&s;uaded, this would rather hurt than mend the matter.</P>
<P>THE Dr. concludes this &s;ection with removing, as he calls it, "the frightful objection of &s;piritual courts"; and he does it by telling us, "we may be &s;ure no &s;uch courts will be erected". This is fully &s;atisfying, &s;o far as we may rely on his word. He &s;eems to allow, that "&s;ome laws which relate to the&s;e courts may bear hard upon Briti&s;h liber|ty"; but &s;ays, "it is probable that the&s;e, and all other Eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, as well as our liturgy
<PB N="191" REF="010853_0190_0F8522A910BF7DA8">
and public offices, and our tran&s;lation of the Bible, will be reviewed as &s;oon as it &s;hall be thought, that there is good &s;en&s;e and candor enough in the body of the nation to admit of it". When this happy day &s;hall arrive, it will be time, and not before, as we judge, to think of an Epi&s;copate in the Colonies.</P>
<P>THE next &s;ection wholly relates to "the ca&s;e of Tythes"; which, as it has no immediate con|nection with the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, and would re|quire a great deal of room thorowly to di&s;cu&s;s, I &s;hall not trouble my &s;elf, or readers, with &s;aying any thing upon it; but proceed to that which follows.</P>

<HEAD>ANSWER to SECTION XI. entitled, farther Su&s;picions and Objections obviated, and the Subject concluded.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t objection is thus expre&s;&s;ed, "it may be inquired, whether new laws will not be made, in ca&s;e of an American-Epi&s;copate, to &s;ub|ject us to the payment of tythes"? The Dr. an|&s;wers, "of this there can be no more rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive, than if Bi&s;hops were not to be &s;ent hither". Very true, if the laws of England, re|lating to tythes, &s;hould not be interpreted to bind in America, or no enacting clau&s;e &s;hould be added to make them to be of force here: But of this there might be "rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive", through the influence of Bi&s;hops; e&s;pecially, if the &s;upport of mo&s;t of the Epi&s;copal Clergy, in many of the Colonies, &s;hould continue to depend on the charity of benefactors at home, as would probably be the ca&s;e. This would afford a plau&s;ible argu|ment to &s;ubject the Colonies to the law of tythes; and no man living can &s;ay, they would not, in time, be thus &s;ubjected. Without all doubt, this law, or &s;ome other le&s;s offen&s;ive in it's &s;ound, would take place here, as &s;oon as the &s;tate of things would allow of it. The Dr. him&s;elf has incauti|ou&s;ly
<PB N="193" REF="010853_0192_0F8522B18D154DE0">
dropt that, which naturally leads to &s;uch a thought, under the next objection he mentions, which is;</P>
<P>"AS ignorance is ever &s;u&s;picious, it may be farther a&s;ked, &s;hall we not be taxed in this Coun|try for the &s;upport of Bi&s;hops, if any &s;hould be appointed"?

And yet, he immedi|ately adds, <Q>But &s;hould a general tax be laid up|on the COUNTRY, and thereby a &s;um be rai&s;ed &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e,&mdash;I believe &s;uch a tax would not amount to more than four pence on one hundred pounds. And this would be no mighty hard&s;hip upon the COUNTRY. He that would think much of giving the &s;ix thou&s;andth part of his income to any u&s;e, which the Legi&s;la|ture of his Country &s;hould a&s;&s;ign, de&s;erves not to be con&s;idered in the light of a good &s;ubject, or member of &s;ociety.</Q> You here &s;ee, ye Co|loni&s;ts, the opinion of the Dr. and, we rea&s;onably pre&s;ume, of the Epi&s;copal-Clergy under who&s;e di|rection he wrote, that the COUNTRY might, in equity, be taxed for the &s;upport of Bi&s;hops; that it would be "no mighty hard&s;hip", if it &s;hould; yea, that we &s;hould not be worthy of the "cha|racter of good &s;ubjects, if we thought much of it". If the COUNTRY might be thus taxed, the tax might be laid upon tho&s;e Coloni&s;ts who&s;e fore|fathers for&s;ook their native land, with all it's ac|commodations and comforts, that they might be freed from the Epi&s;copal yoke of bondage. And &s;hall it be declared, in the face of the world, that this would be "no hard&s;hip" to their po&s;terity, and that they would be neither good &s;ubjects, or good

members of &s;ociety, if they "thought much" of &s;upporting that power which has been, and may again be, terribly oppre&s;&s;ive? Would this give no unea&s;ine&s;s?

If the COUNTRY might be taxed four pence in one hundred pounds, it might, for the &s;ame rea|&s;on, and with as much ju&s;tice, if it was thought the &s;upport of Bi&s;hops called for it, be taxed four &s;hillings, or four pounds in the hundred, and &s;o on to ten pounds, until the tax of tythes was com|pletely fa&s;tened on us. Surely the Dr. was off his guard, or he would not have given us ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, in&s;tead of "ignorantly &s;u&s;pecting", that we &s;hould dearly pay for Bi&s;hops, if they were &s;ent to America.</P>
<P>ANOTHER objection is, "that if Bi&s;hops are &s;et|tled in America, although in the manner we now propo&s;e, there will po&s;&s;ibly be an augmentation of their power, as &s;oon as circum&s;tances will admit of it". But, &s;ays the Dr. <Q>at this rate there can be no end of objecting. For if every po&s;&s;ible ill effect of a thing, proper in it&s;elf, and harmle&s;s in it's tendency, may be made an argument a|gain&s;t it, there is nothing that can e&s;cape. Ar|guments of this &s;ort may as fairly be alleged a|gain&s;t a religious toleration,&mdash;again&s;t allowing the common people the u&s;e of the holy &s;cripture, or the liberty of examining any points of religion or government, &amp;c; for none can tell what ill con&s;equences and abu&s;es may follow, in &s;ome future period, from the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions and indul|gences.</Q> Enough, I tru&s;t, has been already &s;aid to &s;hew, that the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate is neither "proper in it&s;elf", or harmle&s;s in it's tendency"; and the objected "augmentation of power", far
<PB N="195" REF="010853_0194_0F8522B5438AC0E8">
from being MERELY POSSIBLE, is in an high de|gree probable. Would Bi&s;hops here be contented with "re&s;trained powers" longer than they could help it? Would they not endeavour, as they had opportunity, and circum&s;tances would permit, to re|gain tho&s;e appendages they have been deprived of? Would they be ea&s;ie until they were upon an equal footing with their brethren of the &s;ame rank and order at home? Are the&s;e ONLY po&s;&s;ibilities? May they not rather be expected in the natural cour&s;e of things? Nay, the Dr. him&s;elf has unwari|ly opened the workings of his own heart upon this head. Says he, <Q>&s;hould the government &s;ee fit hereafter to inve&s;t them [Bi&s;hops] with &s;ome de|gree of civil power, worthy of their acceptance, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay they will not;&mdash;yet it is inconceivable, that any would thereby be injured.</Q> We are not told, what degree of civil power would be worthy of a Bi&s;hop's acceptance; but, if we may gue&s;s by what is thought worthy at home, it cannot well be &s;uppo&s;ed to be any thing &s;hort of the &s;uper-intendency of two or three Ame|rican-governments. It may ea&s;ily be conceived, wherein this might be "injurious", at lea&s;t, to &s;ome. And, as civil power, in every degree, has in fact been exerci&s;ed, by &s;ome or other, in an op|pre&s;&s;ive arbitrary manner, we are even nece&s;&s;itated not to be at a lo&s;s to conceive, how this might be the ca&s;e, was this kind of power, in whatever degree, ve&s;ted in Bi&s;hops. The Dr. indeed &s;ays, "it is hoped, that our Bi&s;hops will ALWAYS be thought to de&s;erve the character of being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t ability, integrity, and prudence"; which is "all that the happine&s;s and &s;afety of the Public require". But on what does he found this hope? Neither Bi&s;hops, nor any other men in dignity and
<PB N="196" REF="010853_0195_0F8522B5DAE4DB70">
power, have ALWAYS been remarkable for &s;upe|rior ability, or integrity, or prudence. This is too much to be expected in &s;uch a world as our's. It has never yet been the ca&s;e in any age, or place. And &s;hould it happen, in time to come, that Bi|&s;hops here &s;hould be not only wanting in the&s;e good qualities, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the contrary ones, would it be at all difficult to conceive wherein they might be injurious? But &s;uppo&s;ing the be&s;t, that they were ALWAYS the men that have been de|&s;cribed, would it be no hurt to the Church of Chri&s;t, &s;hould there be conjoined with their &s;piri|tual powers, tho&s;e that are of a worldly nature? Would this be no injury to the &s;pecial objects of their care, as God's mini&s;ters in his kingdom that is not of this world? Timothy was, in the Dr's opinion, a Bi&s;hop of the highe&s;t order in the Church; and what were the &s;entiments of the in&s;pired Paul, relative to his proper work as &s;uch? Says he to him,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 2. 3.</NOTE> "Thou therefore endure hardne&s;s as a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. No man that warreth en|tangleth him&s;elf with the AFFAIRS OF THIS LIFE". And again,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 4. 15.</NOTE> "Meditate on the&s;e things, give thy &s;elf WHOLLY to them, that thy profiting may appear to all". There is, in the nature of the thing, an incongruity in ve&s;ting the &s;ame per&s;ons with &s;piritual and civil powers. It unavoidably tends to divide their minds, as well as labors; and is much more adapted to do hurt, than good. Bi&s;hop Latimer, one of the fir&s;t reformers, and a ble&s;&s;ed Martyr for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, has expre&s;&s;ed his &s;entiments upon this head very ju&s;tly and &s;trik|ingly, in his &s;ermon of the plough; which I re|commend to the Dr's peru&s;al.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="010853_0196_0F8522B644F99328">
I HAVE now taken notice of what he has reply'd to "all the objections", he &s;ays "have been made again&s;t &s;ending Bi&s;hops to America, &s;o far as has come to his knowledge"; and I willingly leave it with the reader to judge, whether, in&s;tead of having proved them to be "unrea&s;onable and groundle&s;s", he has not, by what he has offered, added to their real &s;trength, rendering them more difficult to be ju&s;tly an&s;wered. He &s;eems to think it "po&s;&s;ible o|ther objections may be &s;ugge&s;ted"; and herein he has judged right. Such objections have, in the&s;e papers, been placed before his view, not as "in|vented by dexterity, or ill-will", but as naturally and obviou&s;ly ari&s;ing from the true merits of the cau&s;e it&s;elf: Nor do we think they are capable of being refuted. "Cavilers and Sophi&s;ts" may at|tempt their refutation, and, by the help of "leger|demain", they may po&s;&s;ibly do it with &s;ome "ap|pearance of plau&s;ibility" to vulgar eyes; but &s;hould they "employ their talents in this exer|ci&s;e", though they might plea&s;e them&s;elves, as children are diverted while "engaged in crambo or pu&s;h-pin", they would neither "de&s;erve the public attention", or impo&s;e upon men of good under&s;tanding, and &s;olid judgment.</P>
<P>THE Dr. concludes his &s;ubject with a few mi&s;|cellaneous thoughts, he may &s;uppo&s;e of &s;ome weight. Says he, "unle&s;s Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;pe|dily &s;ent, we can fore&s;ee nothing but the <HI>ruin</HI> of the Church in this Country". So far as it is a STATE-CHURCH, there is no rea&s;on for concern a|bout it's ruin. Wherein it is a Church having no officers, &s;uperior or inferior, but PURELY SCRIPTU|RAL ones, and walking according to no rule but that which is of DIVINE appointment, it's "ruin" can|not
<PB N="198" REF="010853_0197_0F8522B70A0EFB50">
not be feared, but through want of faith in the &s;uper-intending government of the great "Head over all things".&mdash;Says he, "the Church of Eng|land here is &s;o e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame with the Church at home, that it mu&s;t ever &s;ub&s;i&s;t or peri&s;h by the &s;ame means". The Church of England at home, and here, may peri&s;h in regard of a STATE-ESTAB|LISHMENT, and undoubtedly will, &s;ooner or la|ter; but &s;o far as it is a Church, built on the "foundation of the Apo&s;tles", Chri&s;t him&s;elf being "the chief corner-&s;tone", it will "&s;ub&s;i&s;t" again&s;t all oppo&s;ition of earth and hell.&mdash;Says he, "The Church here has been long &s;truggling under &s;uch an increa&s;ing load of difficulties, and is now in &s;uch a &s;tate of oppre&s;&s;ion, as to de&s;erve the compa&s;&s;ion of the whole chri&s;tian world". We are really a&s;to|ni&s;hed at this hyperbolical repre&s;entation; and can no otherwi&s;e account for, or excu&s;e it, than by &s;up|po&s;ing that the Dr's zeal had, at this time, depriv|ed him of all &s;ober judgment.&mdash;Says he, "the author need not u&s;e many words to prove, that con&s;iderations, even of a political nature, are &s;uffi|cient, in this ca&s;e, to prevail with tho&s;e who are in&s;en&s;ible to other motives". What he means here is, "that no form of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical government can &s;o exactly harmoni&s;e with a <HI>mixed</HI> monarchy in the &s;tate, as that of a <HI>qualified</HI> Epi&s;copacy". But it ought to be remembered, the Dr's Bi&s;hops, accord|ing to his own account of them, pag. 14, 15. are ABSOLUTE MONARCHS in the CHURCH; and SUCH mu&s;t Kings be in the STATE to make out a proper analogy. Bi&s;hops there have been, even in England, who, in their own imaginations, were ABSOLUTE MONARCHS in the CHURCH; and they would have made the King the &s;ame ABSOLUTE MONARCH in the STATE, to the de&s;truction of that
<PB N="199" REF="010853_0198_0F8522B7B8D54930">
wi&s;ely contrived mixture of power, which gives the Briti&s;h-&s;tate-con&s;titution the preference to any on the whole earth. The government of the Church, by the Dr's Bi&s;hops, is more unlike the government of the &s;tate, by King, Lords and Com|mons, than any form of government in the Church that was ever known in the Colonies; and, per|haps, is more naturally and powerfully adapted to &s;ubvert it.&mdash;Says he, in a word to tho&s;e who have been aver&s;e to American Bi&s;hops, "the &s;ubject is here placed in it's true light, and thereby, it is tru&s;ted, their mi&s;apprehen&s;ions are fairly removed, and con&s;equent fears are &s;hewn to be groundle&s;s". As the Epi&s;copate propo&s;ed is not, in all re&s;pects, as we apprehended it might be, upon it's fir&s;t ap|pearance, &s;o far our conceptions are rectified; but the Dr. is much mi&s;taken, if he thinks, that he has removed our fears. By what he has offered, e&s;pe|cially in an&s;wer to objections, in&s;tead of &s;hewing that they are "groundle&s;s", he has really added &s;trength to the rea&s;ons on which they were ground|ed. We are, from him, more &s;atisfied than ever, that an Epi&s;copate in the Colonies, upon the pub|li&s;hed plan, even in his view of it's operation, will be greatly hurtful. It ought not therefore to be expected, though we call our&s;elves "friends of truth, ju&s;tice and liberty", that we &s;hould do any thing to help forward the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops.&mdash;Says he, on one &s;uppo&s;ition, in order to point out the "inju&s;tice and cruelty" of endeavouring to prevent the Epi&s;copate a&s;ked for, "If all the re|ligious denominations in America, by the general con&s;titution of the Briti&s;h Colonies, are to be treat|ed on the footing of a perfect equality, for which &s;ome have contended; then the Church of Eng|land is as fully entitled to the compleat enjoy|ment
<PB N="200" REF="010853_0199_0F8C68DF63650130">
of it's own di&s;cipline and in&s;titutions, as any other chri&s;tians". Who ever objected again&s;t this "compleat enjoyment", upon the footing of a "perfect equality"? The "other chri&s;tians" do not enjoy, nor do they de&s;ire to enjoy, any religi|ous liberty but that wherewith Chri&s;t, without di&s;crimination, has made his di&s;ciples free; and if this is not enjoyed by Epi&s;copalians "as compleat|ly", as by the other denominations in the Colonies, it is becau&s;e they want to be upon an UNEQUAL FOOTING with their neighbours; that is, to have Bi&s;hops that are more than MEER SCRIPTURAL ones, that &s;hall exerci&s;e their authority under the patronage of a STATE-ESTABLISHMENT, whereby they would be di&s;tingui&s;hed from, and &s;et above, all the other denominations in America; which, as we are verily per&s;waded, would be putting them into circum&s;tances, they have no right, either from na|ture or grace, rea&s;on or revelation, to expect or de&s;ire. If they have &s;uch right, let the grant of it, as made to them, be produced, that it's authenticity may be fairly examined in the view of the Public; if they have not, their complaints are unrea&s;onable.&mdash;Says he, in fine, on another &s;uppo&s;ition, "if any denomination is entitled to a &s;uperiority above o|thers, as is believed by many; then the claim of the Church of England to this preference is not to be di&s;puted". We di&s;pute it not in regard of Virgi|nia and Maryland; but as to the Colonies north|ward of the&s;e, we think, the preference, in point of &s;uperiority, if &s;uch preference be at all &s;uppo&s;ed, ought, in common ju&s;tice, to be given to them; not only as they are more than thirty times more numerous than the Epi&s;copalians, but as they have merited di&s;tingui&s;hing favor, &s;o far as it may rea|&s;onably be be&s;towed, in virtue of the va&s;t expence

of labor, trea&s;ure and blood, their fore-fathers, in &s;ome of the&s;e Colonies, have been at, to extend the Briti&s;h Empire, and add to it's &s;trength, riches and glory.</P>
<P>HAVING thus largely con&s;idered the PLAN PROPOSED for an American Epi&s;copate, and what has been offered in it's vindication, I &s;hall not think it proper to conclude without fir&s;t letting the Dr. and his friends who voted him their writer, know, that we give full credit to what they have declared, upon having mentioned their plan for an Epi&s;copate, upon it's FIRST APPEARANCE, in the Colonies, namely, "this, without any re&s;ervation, or equivocation, is the exact plan which has been &s;ettled at home; and the only one on which Bi|&s;hops have been reque&s;ted here, either in our ge|neral or more particular addre&s;&s;es". But then, we would, at the &s;ame time, add, that we mu&s;t be excu&s;ed, if we &s;ay, we do not believe, they would ever have contrived, or propo&s;ed, this plan, had it not been, as they imagined, a &s;cheme for the introduction of Bi&s;hops that would carry with it a plau&s;ible &s;hew, and give opportunity to keep that out of &s;ight which would occa&s;ion univer&s;al un|ea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;content. We are neither &s;o void of di&s;cernment, or unacquainted with the intrigues of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t zealous for an American Epi&s;copate, as not to be fully &s;atisfied, they have much more in de&s;ign than they have been plea&s;ed openly to declare. Their ultimate views, what|ever they propo&s;e to begin with, have not been &s;o perfectly &s;ecreted in their own brea&s;ts, but that they have been whi&s;pered about from one friend to another, &s;o that we are at no lo&s;s to form a true judgment of them. The Dr. him&s;elf, though
<PB N="202" REF="010853_0201_0F8C68DFF5779B58">
he &s;ays, pag. 79. "they have carefully con&s;ulted our &s;afety and &s;ecurity, and &s;tudied not to injure but oblige us", has yet very freely, however injudi|ciou&s;ly, given us to under&s;tand, pag. 107. that "a tax", in con&s;equence of the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops upon this very plan, "may be laid upon the COUNTRY"; which, if it &s;hould, "would be no mighty hard&s;hip", and &s;hould we think it &s;uch, we "&s;hould not de&s;erve to be con&s;idered in the light of good &s;ubjects, or members of &s;ociety": Nay, he even &s;uppo&s;es, notwith&s;tanding the expre&s;s guard again&s;t it in the plan, that Bi&s;hops "may hereafter be inve&s;ted with civil powers worthy of their ac|ceptance", and is particular in his ju&s;tification of it as rea&s;onable, pag. 110. Other things have tran&s;pired from tho&s;e, who did not know how, or were not able, to keep a &s;ecret. We are as fully per&s;uaded, as if they had openly &s;aid it, that they have in view nothing &s;hort of a COMPLETE CHURCH HIERARCHY after the pattern of that at home, with like officers in all their various degrees of dignity, with a like large revenue for their grand &s;upport, and with the allowance of no other privilege to di&s;&s;enters but that of a bare toleration.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The REASON, upon which the petition of the New-York-Pre&s;byterian-Church for a Charter to &s;ecure the bones of their decea&s;ed relatives and friends, was negatived at home, by the interpo&s;ition of a right reverend Father in God, is an evident &s;pecimen of this. And it was, without all doubt, for the SAME REASON that the incorporating-act, pa&s;&s;ed in this pro|vince, relative to the propagation of religion among the Indian-natives, was, in like manner, through Prelatical influence, rendered null and void And if what we have heard is true, that a TWENTIETH PART, of the American conquered lands, as they are and may be granted by the Crown to private per&s;ons, or bodies of men, is and will be appropriated to the u&s;e and benefit of the Church of England in the Colonies, a founda|tion is laid, and laying for as great a Church-revenue as they have at home. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e planners have nothing in view, but what is perfectly "harmle&s;s to other denominations?"

The other de|nominations, from their fir&s;t capacity of moral di&s;cernment, have been indoctrinated in that way of &s;erving God that is peculiar to them. And will they ea&s;ily give this up, and embrace the Epi&s;copal mode of wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline? "Hath a nation changed their gods which yet are no Gods"? If people, in pagan Countries, who have been taught by their ance&s;tors to wor&s;hip Idols, which are vanity, in&s;tead of the living Jehovah, will not, without the utmo&s;t difficulty, be wrought upon to change the object of their devotion; why

A &s;trange change mu&s;t be effected in that temper of mind they have hitherto di&s;covered, and that has, upon certain oc|ca&s;ions in providence, been greatly improved and &s;trengthened, if they &s;hould be per&s;uaded, in&s;tead of enjoying the freedom of chri&s;tians, to take up|on them that yoke of bondage, which their Pro|genitors threw off as too burden&s;ome and galling to bear! In vain may this be looked for. There is not the lea&s;t rea&s;onable room to hope for &s;uch a thing; and it is really &s;urpri&s;ing, the Epi&s;copalians are not convinced of it, after &s;o long a tryal to &s;o little purpo&s;e. It is our firm faith, tru&s;ting in God, that the principles of religious as well as civil liberty will ever di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e Colonies, and that go&s;pel wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, in their purity and &s;implicity, which was the great Errand of our fore-fathers in coming over to this new world, will be upheld and maintained here, from genera|tion to generation, until time &s;hall be no more, whatever plans may be formed to the contrary, and whatever efforts may be made to carry them into execution.</P>
