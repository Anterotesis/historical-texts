<HEAD>SERMON I. Man's Inability to comply with the Go&s;pel.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JOHN VI. 44.</BIBL>
<P>No Man can come to me, except the Father which hath &s;ent me draw him.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IT is, no doubt, of the la&s;t importance, that people &s;hould be convinced, and made thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of their impotence and helple&s;ne&s;s in them&s;elves, and their entire dependence on divine grace, for &s;alvation. So long as &s;inners think they can recom|mend them&s;elves to the favour of God, by their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, they will never
<Q>come unto Chri&s;t, that they might have life.</Q>
For
<Q>the whole have no need of the phy&s;ician, but they that are &s;ick.</Q>
And &s;o long as per&s;ons imagine they labour under no in&s;uperable ina|bility, as to complying with the go&s;pel, they will never feel their dependence on him, who alone is able to work in them,
<Q>the whole good plea&s;ure of his goodne&s;s, and
<PB N="4" REF="011467_0003_0F832F3578F37F90">
the work of faith with power.</Q>
Nor will they feel di&s;po&s;ed, or &s;ee the occa&s;ion they have, to
<Q>give unto God the glory, which is indeed due unto his name,</Q>
In their &s;alvation. Accordingly, the depravity, blindne&s;s and deadne&s;s of mankind, in things of a &s;piritual nature, and their utter inability to comply with the go&s;pel, as well as to obtain &s;alvation by the deeds of the law, are much inculcated and in&s;i&s;ted on, in the &s;acred &s;criptures.</P>
<P>BUT then, there is a difficulty, in the minds of many, how to reconcile this total helple&s;ne&s;s of &s;inners, with the &s;incerity of the go&s;pel offers, or with the ju&s;tice of men's being condemned and puni&s;hed, for their impenitence and unbelief. And indeed, it does &s;eem as if men could not be to blame, for not doing impo&s;&s;ibilities: Nor &s;hould we in other ca&s;es, think there was much kindne&s;s or &s;incerity, in offering a favour on conditions that were known to be impracticable.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;carce any one, I believe, that has ever tho't much about religion, but what has, at one time or o|ther, felt him&s;elf pinched with this difficulty. And it is won't to have a mo&s;t pernicious influence upon the minds of &s;inners in general; but more e&s;pecially, when they come to be under awakenings, and begin to enquire, "what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved." According to what they hear in &s;ermons, yea, and according to what they read in their bibles, they are greatly at a lo&s;s to &s;ee, how the ways of the Lord can be equal. "The carnal mind," they are told,
<Q>is &mdash; not &s;ubject to the law of God, nei|ther indeed <HI>can</HI> be.</Q>
And that,
<Q>they that are in the fle&s;h <HI>cannot</HI> plea&s;e God.</Q>
They are therefore under a <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of &s;inning, yea, of doing nothing el&s;e but &s;in. And yet, "every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and di&s;obedience," is to receive a mo&s;t dreadful "recompence of reward," the wrath of God being
<Q>revealed from heaven, again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men.</Q>
And no relief, no deliverence from wrath, is to be hoped for through the go&s;pel, but upon impo&s;&s;ible conditions: Such
<PB N="5" REF="011467_0004_0F832F3612808AB0">
conditions as no natural man, no one who is dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, ever did, ever will, or can comply with. And yet a non-compliance with the&s;e conditions, expo&s;es to an amazingly aggravated, additional condem|nation; in&s;omuch that it will be more tolerable for So|dom and Gomorrah, in the day of judgment, than for tho&s;e who enjoy the light of the go&s;pel, and do not em|brace the &s;alvation it offers.</P>
<P>But how the&s;e things are con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on; how they can ever be reconciled with the goodne&s;s, or the ju&s;|tice of God, they are greatly at a lo&s;s. Such a view of the matter, &s;eems to them to make the Mo&s;t High indeed, what the &s;lothful &s;ervant &s;aid, a hard ma&s;ter,
<Q>reaping where he has not &s;own, and gathering where he has not &s;trewed.</Q>
Or, like the cruel Egyptian ta&s;k|ma&s;ters, requiring the full tale of brick, without allowing the nece&s;&s;ary &s;traw; requiring that of his creatures which he knows exceeds their utmo&s;t &s;trength, and then they are beaten; yea, mu&s;t be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de|&s;truction, for not doing, what they would do with all their hearts, but it is no more in their power, than it is to make a world.</P>
<P>Now, until this difficulty can be fairly got over in peo|ple's minds, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould, in their con|&s;ciences, ju&s;tify God, or condemn them&s;elves as he con|demns them. Or that they &s;hould under&s;tand, either the ju&s;tice of the divine law, or the grace of the go&s;pel. It is therefore certainly highly nece&s;&s;ary, that what the &s;crip|ture &s;ays upon this &s;ubject, &s;hould be &s;et in a con&s;i&s;tent light, &s;o as to commend it&s;elf to every man's con&s;cience, in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal ways, in which this has been at|tempted. Some account for God's &s;u&s;pending our &s;alva|tion upon impo&s;&s;ible conditions, and condemning men for not doing what it is not in their power to do, by ob|&s;erving, that we lo&s;t our power by the fall. Our pre&s;ent weakne&s;s and blindne&s;s, was brought upon us as a righ|teous
<PB N="6" REF="011467_0005_0F832F38DE8D59A0">
puni&s;hment, for the di&s;obedience of Adam; and God, they &s;ay, has not lo&s;t his right to command, becau&s;e man, by his own folly and &s;in, has lo&s;t his ability to o|bey. That is, we ought, it is our pre&s;ent real duty to exert, not only all the &s;trength we actually have, but all we &s;hould have had, had it not been for the original a|po&s;tacy.</P>
<P>BUT to this it will be objected, that we never rea&s;on and judge in &s;uch a manner, in any other ca&s;e. We do not think tho&s;e who have lo&s;t their eyes, are &s;till to blame for not &s;eeing; or tho&s;e who have lo&s;t their rea&s;on, for not under&s;tanding; or that it is the duty of tho&s;e to la|bour with their hands, who have no hands to labour with. Not, though we &s;uppo&s;e they were deprived of tho&s;e fa|culties, in a righteous manner, for their &s;ins. Or, &s;uppo&s;e a &s;ervant, by his own folly and bad conduct, has brought a fit of &s;ickne&s;s upon him&s;elf; do we think it rea&s;onable for his ma&s;ter, &s;till to require him to go out into the field every day, and do as much work as if he was well? And is the &s;ervant to blame, in not obeying &s;uch commands? Does he daily commit new &s;in, in not working, when perhaps he now wi&s;hes with all his heart he was able to do it; but has not &s;trength enough to go a &s;tep, or bear his weight?</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t, I think, be granted, we do generally &s;uppo&s;e, a man's <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> duty cannot exceed his pre&s;ent &s;trength, even let his &s;trength have been impared by what means it will. We never hear even a good man, pretend to re|pent or blame him&s;elf, that he has not &s;een the light of the &s;un all day, and re&s;olve not to be guilty of the &s;ame &s;in to-morrow, when he has been &s;tone blind for twenty years. I &s;hall not therefore, undertake the defence of this, as any &s;olution of the difficulty, to the apprehen&s;ion of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e. Nor can I think that any one was ever inwardly convinced of the &s;in of unbelief in this way. However well meant it might probably be, by the fir&s;t inventers of it, it &s;eems rather calculated to
<PB N="7" REF="011467_0006_0F832F3989BEF308">
<HI>ea&s;e</HI> the con&s;ciencies of men, by ca&s;ting all real blame, back upon the fir&s;t &s;in only.</P>
<P>OTHERS, (and tho&s;e who would not be thought, and are not &s;u&s;pected, to leanin any mea&s;ure towards arminiani&s;m) have &s;uppo&s;ed it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;often matters a little, as to the &s;overeignty of grace, and the helple&s;ne&s;s of &s;inners, if we would avoid the above incon&s;i&s;tency, or reflection up|on the divine ju&s;tice. They would have it maintained, indeed, that &s;inners are unable to do much, if any thing towards their &s;elvation, merely of them&s;elves. Nor do they &s;uppo&s;e that any one is ever brought to true repen|tance and faith in Chri&s;t, without the &s;pecial grace of God. But then they apprehend, it may, and mu&s;t be ad|mitted, that &s;inners are able, by the help of <HI>common</HI> grace, to do tho&s;e things which are connected with, and may be con&s;idered as a &s;ort of preliminary conditions of &s;alvation: conditions upon which regeneration, &amp; an ability to come up to the actual terms of the go&s;pel, is promi&s;ed, or howe|ver, will undoubtedly be be&s;towed. That is, they &s;uppo&s;e, if &s;inners will &s;eek and pray, u&s;e the means of grace, and do the be&s;t that per&s;ons under their circum&s;tances, and having &s;uch hearts as they have, <HI>may</HI> do; God will not be wanting on his part, or leave them to peri&s;h. That if they exert all the &s;trength, and make a good improvement of all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they have, they &s;hall have more, and more given them; till in the end they are enabled to obtain mercy, and to lay hold on eternal life. That if there are no ab&s;olute promi&s;es, to &s;uch earne&s;t and &s;incere, though feeble, efforts of the unregenerate, yet certainly there are many very precious encouragements; which may indeed, &s;ecurely enough be relied on. So that, on the whloe, no &s;inner is under any real impo&s;&s;ibility of obtaining &s;alvati|on. For every one, let his impotence be as great as it will, can certainly do what he can. And if upon his do|ing this, God will not fail to help him, as to what he can|not do; then every one <HI>may</HI> be &s;aved, any weakne&s;s or depravity he labours under, notwith&s;tan&s;ting. Nor do
<PB N="8" REF="011467_0007_0F832F3A081B8408">
they &s;ee how we can vindicate the divine ju&s;tice, or fairly ca&s;t the blame of the &s;inners perdition on him&s;elf, without &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a univer&s;al &s;ufficiency of grace, as this.</P>
<P>Now if this can be made out to be really the ca&s;e, that all are actually and in every view, <HI>enabled</HI> to do tho&s;e things which are connected with eternal life; there will be no difficulty, I apprehend, with any one, to &s;ee that the ways of the Lord are equal. For according to this, there &s;eems to be no re&s;pect of per&s;ons with God, even in the di&s;tribution of his free&s;t favours, any more than in his judicial proceedings. The difference between him that is &s;aved, and him that peri&s;heth, not originating from any in equality in the be&s;towment of divine grace; but &s;olely from the better improvement one &s;inner makes of the &s;ame grace, than another does. Here then the way is clear on the &s;ide of natural notions, rea&s;on, and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT, I am afraid, it will be as hard to reconcile this way of &s;olving matters, with the &s;criptures, and with the truth of fact, as it is, the former one, with rea&s;on. Cer|tainly, the &s;criptures &s;eems to &s;peak a language quite dif|ferent from this. In them we are taught,
<Q>That it is God that maketh one man to differ from an other, for the better, and not he him&s;elf. That it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that &s;hewith mercy.</Q>
and "that he hath mercy, on whom he will bave mercy; and whom he will he harden|eth." And in our text, our Saviour accounts for the mur|muring and oppo&s;ition, of the unbeleiving jews, by mak|ing this ob&s;ervation to his di&s;ciples upon it; "no man can come to me, except the father which hath &s;ent me draw him." By which he evidently ment to intimate, that the conduct of his oppo&s;ers, con&s;idering what human nature was, was not to be wondered at. That they acted no otherways than all other men would, if left to them|&s;elves as they were. That tho&s;e who now followed and obeyed him, would never have come to him or become
<PB N="9" REF="011467_0008_0F832F3A9B64BDB8">
his di&s;ciples, had it not been for a gracious divine influ|ence upon their minds, which was not granted to tho&s;e murmurers and oppo&s;ers; had they not been effectually drawn, by him in who&s;e hand are the hearts of men, and who turneth them as the rivers of water are turned. We are plainly taught in this text, taken in the connection in which it &s;tands, as we are al&s;o in a multitude of other places, that men do not fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, by hearkening to the calls of the go&s;pel; but that it is God that makes one to differ from another, in this re&s;pect, by his &s;overeign and di&s;tingui&s;hing grace. The point of doctrine, there|fore, that I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon from the words is this,</P>
<P>That none are <HI>able</HI> to comply with the go&s;pel, but tho&s;e who are the &s;ubjects of the &s;pecial and <HI>effectual</HI> grace of God; or tho&s;e who are made willing, and actually <HI>do</HI> comply with it.</P>
<P>WHAT I have in view, in the following di&s;cour&s;e, is not only to confirm this doctrine; but to endeavour to &s;et it in &s;uch a light, as to obviate the formentioned difficulty, of &s;alvation's being offered on impo&s;&s;ible conditions, and men's being condemned for not doing, that which they are incapable of. And after what has been &s;aid, I think there is no way of attempting to clear up this my&s;tery, left, but by &s;hewing that there are two e&s;&s;entially differ|ent &s;en&s;es, in which men are &s;aid to be incapable of doing things: or, by having recour&s;e to the di&s;tinction of natu|ral and moral inability. Accordingly, the method I pro|po&s;e, is,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. AS clearly as I can, to &s;tate and illu&s;trate this di&s;|tinction.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. TO &s;how, that men certainly labour under one, or the other, of the&s;e kinds of inability to comply with the go&s;pel, until they are made the &s;ubjects of effec|tual divine grace.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. MORE particularly to con&s;ider and evince, the <HI>mo|ral</HI> impotence of &s;inners, And</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. ENDEAVOUR to make it appear, that there is, ordi|narily,
<PB N="10" REF="011467_0009_0F832F3B79D9E408">
<HI>no other</HI> incapacity in &s;inners, in this matter, but only of the moral kind.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. THEN, it is to be ob&s;erved, for the clearing up of this &s;ubject, that there are two very different kinds of in|ability: &s;o different, that the one however great does not le&s;&s;en moral obligation in the lea&s;t; whereas the other, as far as it goes, takes away obligation, and all de&s;ert of blame and puni&s;hment intirely.</P>
<P>THESE two kinds of inability, as I hinted, have com|monly been di&s;tingui&s;hed, by calling one a natural, the other a moral inability. Which di&s;tinction may be brief|ly &s;tated thus. Moral inability con&s;i&s;ts only in the want of a heart, or di&s;po&s;ition, or will, to do a thing. Natu|ral inability on the other hand, con&s;i&s;ts in, or ari&s;es from, want of under&s;tanding, bodily &s;trength, opportunity; or, <HI>whatever may prevent,</HI> our doing a thing, when we are willing, and &s;trongly enough di&s;po&s;ed and inclin'd to do it. Or, in fewer words, thus: whatever a man could not do, <HI>if he would,</HI> he is under a natural inability of doing; but when all the rea&s;on one <HI>can't</HI> do a thing, is becau&s;e he has not <HI>a mind</HI> to, the inability is only of a moral nature.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;tinction takes place, equally with regard to evil actions, and good ones. Thus, for in&s;tance, the divine being <HI>cannot</HI> do evil; not becau&s;e he wants opportunity, or under&s;tanding, or &s;trength, to do, with infinite ea&s;e, whatever he plea&s;es; but only becau&s;e he is not, and it's impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be, inclined to do iniquity. He is &s;o infinitely &amp; immutably holy, wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and good; that it is not po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould ever <HI>plea&s;e</HI> to act otherways, than in the mo&s;t holy, righteous, and be&s;t manner. Hence, though we read that, "with God <HI>all things</HI> are po&s;&s;ible," and that he can do <HI>every</HI> thing; yet al&s;ewhere we are told,
<Q>he cannot <HI>deny him&s;elf</HI>; and that it is impo&s;&s;ible, for God to <HI>lie.</HI></Q></P>
<P>ON the other hand, &s;atan is incapable of doing right, or of behaving virtuou&s;ly, in the lea&s;t in&s;tance or degree. But not becau&s;e he wants natural abilities; for undoubt|edly
<PB N="11" REF="011467_0010_0F832F3C1D77EE18">
in that re&s;pect, he is far &s;uperior to many that are truly virtuous. His being incapable of any thing but infernal wickedne&s;s, is altogether owing to his being of &s;uch an infernal di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>AND it is not uncommon, to &s;peak of incapacity in man|kind, both as to doing good and doing evil, in this two|fold &s;ignification. Some per&s;ons we &s;ay are incapable of doing <HI>a mean thing.</HI> Not that we think it is above their <HI>natural</HI> capacity; but it is beneath them; they abhor, or they would &s;corn to do it. Others are incapable of &s;e|veral &s;orts of villany, not through any want of good will enough that way. They only want a convenient oppor|tunity, or &s;ufficient ingenuity.&mdash;And ju&s;t &s;o it is in regard to doing good. Some have it not in the power of their hands; others have no heart to it. One is of a truly gene|rous &s;pirit, and nothing but his own poverty, keeps him from being what Job was, a father to the poor, the father|le&s;s and him that has none to help him. Another is rich, and might be a great benefactor and ble&s;&s;ing to all a|round him; but he has no heart to devi&s;e liberal things. He <HI>can't</HI> be free and open handed; it isn't in him to be &s;o. He is <HI>deaf</HI> to the cries of the poor, <HI>blind</HI> to their wants, &amp; <HI>dead</HI> to all the generous feelings of humanity and com|pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>SOME are &s;o feeble and infirm, that they can do &s;carce any bodily labour; though they are extremely free and willing to lay them&s;elves out to the utmo&s;t that their &s;trength will bear, and often go beyond it. Others are &s;trong and healthy enough, and might get a good living, and be u&s;eful members of &s;ociety; but &s;uch is their in|vincible lazine&s;s, that their hands refu&s;e to labour, and they can hardly get them out of their bo&s;oms. Some are effectually kept from &s;hining, or being very u&s;eful, in a|ny public &s;phere in church or &s;tate, through the weakne&s;s of their heads: others, as effectually, by the badne&s;s of their hearts. Some are incapable of being taught by rea|&s;on of mere natural dulne&s;s: others only becau&s;e they are
<PB N="12" REF="011467_0011_0F832F3CF75B3BF0">
of an unreachable &s;pirit, and full of &s;elf-conceit. Some are blind for want of eyes; but it is an old proverb, that none are more blind, than tho&s;e who <HI>won't</HI> &s;ee.</P>
<P>THESE examples, are &s;ufficient to illu&s;trate the di&s;tinc|tion I am in&s;i&s;ting on, and to make it evident, that by <HI>incapable,</HI> we often mean &s;omething very different from want of natural capacity. We may al&s;o perceive from the&s;e in&s;tances, that there is a real nece&s;&s;ity for u&s;ing &s;uch words as, <HI>unable, incapable can't,</HI> &amp;c. in this diver&s;ity of &s;ignification, in which we &s;ee they are u&s;ed, in common &s;peech, as well as in the &s;criptures. For whenever any thing, whether in our&s;elves or without us, is really ab|&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with our doing a thing, we have no way fully and &s;trongly enough to expre&s;s that incon&s;i&s;|tence, but by &s;aying we are <HI>unable,</HI> we <HI>cannot,</HI> it is <HI>im|po&s;&s;ible</HI>; or u&s;ing &s;ome word of like import. And now it is certain that want of a heart, or inclination to do a thing, may be, and is, as incon&s;i&s;tent with our doing it, as any thing el&s;e could be. Covetuou&s;ne&s;s is as incon&s;i&s;tent with liberality as poverty is, and may as effectually hin|der a man from doing deeds of charity. Indolence is as incon&s;i&s;tent with indu&s;try, as bodily weakne&s;s and infir|mity is. The want of an upright heart and a public &s;pi|rit, is as incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of a good ruler, as the want of wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding. And the want of all principles of virtue, mu&s;t be as incon&s;i&s;tent with acting virtuou&s;ly, as even the want of tho&s;e intellectual fa|culties, which are nece&s;&s;ary to moral agency. And &s;o on the other hand, as to doing evil things. There is no po&s;|&s;ibility of doing them, that is, knowingly, de&s;ignedly, and as moral agents, without an evil di&s;po&s;ition. Our free and moral actions, are, and mu&s;t be, as invariably guided and dictated by our own minds, as they are limited and bounded, by our natural power. That is, every one mu&s;t act his own nature, and choice; otherways he don't act him&s;elf; <HI>he</HI> is not the agent. And if, when we would

expre&s;s this &s;ort of nece&s;&s;ity, we &s;hould not u&s;e the &s;ame phra&s;es as are made u&s;e of in ca&s;es of natural nece&s;&s;ity-but for fear of a mi&s;under&s;tanding, &s;hould carefully avoid &s;aying a man <HI>cannot,</HI> when ever we mean only that he had not &s;uch a heart as is nece&s;&s;ary, and only &s;ay that he <HI>will not,</HI> in all &s;uch ca&s;es; our language would often &s;ound odd, being out of common cu&s;tom, which governs the propriety of words; and not only &s;o, but it would not be &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive. Should we be afraid to &s;ay, it is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> for a man to love God, or come to Chri&s;t, while his heart is altogether, wicked, and full of enmity again&s;t God and Chri&s;t; people would be ready to think we im|magined this might &s;ometimes happen, and that there was no real impo&s;&s;ibility in it of any kind. Whereas there is as real, and as ab&s;olute an impo&s;&s;ibility in this ca&s;e as in any &s;uppo&s;able one whatever. To be more guarded therefore, than the &s;cripture is, in this matter, would be to be unguarded. The apo&s;tle demands,
<Q><HI>can</HI> the fig-tree, my brethren, bear olive-berries? either a vine figs?</Q>
and the prophet,
<Q><HI>can</HI> the Ethiopian change his &s;kin? or the Leopard his &s;pots? then may ye also do good, who are accu&s;tomed to do evil.</Q>
And our Sa|viour &s;ays,
<Q>a good tree <HI>cannot</HI> bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. A good man out of the good trea&s;ure of the heart, bring|eth forth good things. And an evil man out of the e|vil trea&s;ure, bringeth forth evil things.</Q>
There is as cer|tain and never failing a connection in this ca&s;e, as any na|tural connection whatever. Which ought by no means to be di&s;&s;embled, but openly maintained. But then it is certainly of a quite different, and even a directly oppo&s;ite nature, to all intents and purpo&s;es of moral agency. And it is of the la&s;t importance, in my apprehen&s;ion, that this al&s;o &s;hould be maintained, and manife&s;ted to every man's con&s;cience.</P>
<P>BECAUSE a man <HI>mu&s;t</HI> act according to his own heart or as he plea&s;es; does this de&s;troy his freedom! it is the very
<PB N="14" REF="011467_0013_0F832F3E65469658">
thing in which all free agency con&s;i&s;ts.&mdash;The pul&s;e <HI>can</HI> beat; and the limbs can move, in &s;ome bodily di&s;orders, or when one that is &s;tronger than we takes hold of them; whether we will or no. But God does not con&s;ider <HI>us</HI> as accountable, for &s;uch actions as the&s;e. And we &s;hould, not without rea&s;on, think it very hard, &s;hould he blame or puni&s;h us for them. For an hone&s;t and good man's pul&s;e may beat, as irregularly as the wor&s;t villain's in the world. Or his hands, in a convul&s;ion, may &s;trike tho&s;e around him, in &s;pite of all he can do to hold them &s;till. Or one may be carried by force, along with a gang of thieves, and be taken for one of them, though no man hates &s;uch compa|ny and actions as theirs, more heartily than he does. Such involuntary actions, every one &s;ees a man is not, &amp; ought not to be, accountable for. And the rea&s;on is, no bad inclination of ours, or want of a good one, is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> in order to them. They are <HI>&s;o free,</HI> as to be independant of <HI>us,</HI> and out of our power. If all our actions were like the&s;e; noways nece&s;&s;arily connected with our di&s;po&s;ition, and choice, and temper of mind; we could not be ac|countable creatures, or the &s;ubjects of moral government. If a good tree, could bring forth evil fruit, and a corrupt tree good fruit: if a good man, out of the good trea&s;ure of his heart, could bring forth evil things, and an evil man out of the evil trea&s;ure, good things; the tree could never be known-by its fruit. It could never be known by a man's actions, any thing what his heart was. So that, if they were dealt with according to their works, the mo&s;t upright and well di&s;po&s;ed, would be as liable to be puni&s;hed; and the mo&s;t ill-natured and ill-di&s;po&s;ed, as likely to be rewarded, as the contrary. Whence all moral government mu&s;t be at an end.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY, if we are ju&s;tly accountable, rewardable or puni&s;hable, for any actions; if any actions are, or can be, properly <HI>our own,</HI> it mu&s;t be &s;uch as are dictated by our&s;elves, and which <HI>can't</HI> take place without <HI>our</HI> own con&s;ent. An inability, therefore, to act otherways than
<PB N="15" REF="011467_0014_0F832F3F1E861640">
agreeably to our minds, is only an inability to act other|ways than as free agents. And that nece&s;&s;ity which a|ri&s;es from the temper and choice af the agent him&s;elf, and that which is again&s;t his choice and his very nature, are &s;o far from coming to the &s;ame thing at la&s;t, that they are directly contrary one to the other, as to all the purpo&s;es of morality: freedom, accountablene&s;s, and de&s;ert of prai&s;e, or blame, reward or puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>AND this is agreable to the &s;en&s;e of all mankind, in all common ca&s;es. A man's heart being fully &s;et in him to do evil, does not render his evil actions the le&s;s cri|minal, in the judgment of common &s;en&s;e, but the more &s;o: Nor does the &s;trength of a virtuous di&s;po&s;ition, ren|der a good action the <HI>le&s;s,</HI> but the <HI>more</HI> amiable, and worthy of prai&s;e. Does any one look upon the Divine Being, as le&s;s excellent and glorious, for being &s;o infinite|ly and unchangeably holy in his nature, that he
<Q>cannot be tempted with evil,</Q>
or act otherwi&s;e, than in the mo&s;t holy and perfect manner? Does any one look upon the devil, as le&s;s &s;inful and to blame, becau&s;e he is of &s;uch a devili&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o full of cau&s;ele&s;s &s;pite and malice, again&s;t God and man, as to be incapable of any thing, but the mo&s;t horrid wickedne&s;s?&mdash;And as to man|kind: Who is there that does not make a difference, be|tween him that is incapable of a ba&s;e action, only by rea|&s;on of the virtuou&s;ne&s;s of his temper, having all the na|tural talents, requi&s;ite for the mo&s;t con&s;ummate villany; and him that is incapable of being the wor&s;t of villains, for no other rea&s;on, than only becau&s;e he don't know how? Does any one think, that only the want of a will to work, excu&s;es a man from it ju&s;t as much as bodily infirmity does? Or, do we any of us, ever imagine, that the cove|tous mi&s;er, who with all his u&s;ele&s;s hoards, has no heart to give a penny to the poor, is for that rea&s;on, equally excu&s;able from deeds of charity, as he who has nothing to give?</P>
<P>WE certainly, always make a di&s;tinction, betwixt want
<PB REF="011467_0015_0F832F3FF2138CB0">
of natural abilities to do good, and the want of a heart; looking upon the one as a <HI>good</HI> excu&s;e, the other as <HI>no</HI> ex|cu&s;e <HI>at all,</HI> but rather as that in which all wickedne&s;s radi|cally con&s;i&s;ts. A natural fool, no one blames, for acting like a fool: But
<Q>to him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not; to him it is &s;in,</Q>
in the &s;en&s;e of all mankind, as well as in God's account.
<Q>If there be fir&s;t a <HI>willing mind,</HI></Q>
we always &s;uppo&s;e it ought to be
<Q>accepted, according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</Q>
But the want of a willing mind, or not being a mind to do well, is univer&s;ally con&s;idered as a crime, and not as an excu&s;e. Nothing is more fa|miliar to us, than to di&s;tingui&s;h in this manner. Nor can any man of common &s;en&s;e, help judging thus.</P>
<P>NOW, this di&s;tinction is as applicable to the ca&s;e before us, as it is to any other ca&s;e. Some may be unable to comply with the go&s;pel, through the want of tho&s;e powers of mind, or tho&s;e bodily organs, or tho&s;e means of grace, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand the character of Chri&s;t, or the way of &s;alvation, let their hearts be ever &s;o good. In either of which ca&s;es, the inability is of the natural kind. Others, may have all the outward means, and all the natural facul|ties, which are nece&s;&s;ary in order to a right under&s;tanding of the go&s;pel; and yet, through the evil temper of their minds, they may be wholly aver&s;e to it, and wholly blind to the glory of it. They may be di&s;po&s;ed, to make light of all its propo&s;als and invitations, and to treat every thing relating to religion and another world, with the utmo&s;t neglect and indifference. Or if their fears of "the wrath to come," are by any means awakened, and they are made with much &s;olicitude, to enquire
<Q>what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved;</Q>
&s;till, they may be utterly di&s;|inclined to &s;ubmit to the righteou&s;ne&s;s, or the grace of God, as revealed in the Go&s;pel. They may be &s;till, &s;uch
<Q>children of the devil, and enemies of all righteou&s;ne&s;s, as to be irreconcilably aver&s;e to all the right ways of the Lord.</Q>
They may have
<Q>&s;uch an evil heart of un|belief
<PB N="17" REF="011467_0016_0F832F40A4563348">
to depart from the living God,</Q>
as is ab&s;olute|ly incon&s;i&s;tent with con&s;enting to the covenant of grace, or "believing to the &s;aving of the &s;oul." Now, when this is the ca&s;e, the inability the &s;inner is under, is only of a moral nature. We may pa&s;s on now to the</P>
<P N="2">II. HEAD, viz. To &s;how that all who are not the &s;ub|jects of this &s;pecial and effectual grace of God, mu&s;t certainly be unable, in one or the other of the&s;e &s;en&s;es, to come to Chri&s;t, or comply with the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>THOSE, many of them at lea&s;t, who di&s;like the di&s;tinc|tion now explained, and &s;ome who &s;eem in a &s;ort to admit it, &s;uppo&s;e all men have, and mu&s;t have, every kind of ability to do their duty, and to obtain &s;alvati|on. But, I apprehend, it will be very ea&s;y to make appear, that this certainly is not the ca&s;e. A variety of &s;cripture arguments, and a multitude of texts, might be adduced here, were they needed. But that <HI>all</HI> have not, <HI>both</HI> the forementioned kinds of ability to comply with the go&s;pel, either of them&s;elves, or by the help of com|mon grace, is as evident as any thing needs to be, meerly from the fact, that many do not do it, but actually live and die in impenitence and unbelief. By common grace is meant, that grace which is given to &s;inners in general, tho&s;e that are not &s;aved, as well as tho&s;e that are. They who believe all, are in every &s;en&s;e, able to work out their own &s;alvation, through the go&s;pel, would not be thought to fru&s;trate the grace of God. They do not &s;uppo&s;e &s;inners are able to do this <HI>of them&s;elves,</HI> but that &s;ome divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;ome working of God in them, both to will and to do, is really nece&s;&s;ary in the ca&s;e. But then they &s;uppo&s;e, all this needed grace, whatever it be, is given to &s;inners without exception; and hereby they account for God's commanding all men every where, to repent and believe the go&s;pel. "I grant, indeed," &s;ays an ingenious arminian writer, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Stebbing, on the opperations of the &s;pirit.</NOTE>
<Q>that by rea&s;on of original &s;in, we are utterly di&s;abled for the perform|ance
<PB N="18" REF="011467_0017_0F832F415A2373B8">
of the condition, without new grace from God. But I &s;ay then, that he gives &s;uch grace to all of us, by which the performance of the condition is truly po&s;&s;ible, and upon this ground he doth and may mo&s;t righteou&s;ly require it.</Q>
Here by the way, it is wor|thy of particular remark, what notions many are obliged to entertain of divine grace, in order not to reflect upon the divine ju&s;tice. To require <HI>perfect holine&s;s</HI> of creatures &s;o enfeebled and depraved as we are, they &s;uppo&s;e would be evidently one of the mo&s;t <HI>unrea&s;onable</HI> things in the world. Therefore God has been <HI>graciou&s;ly</HI> plea&s;ed to &s;end his Son to obey and die in our room, that we might not be "under the law but under grace." But then the covenant of <HI>grace,</HI> is not mild and gracious enough to be quite &s;trictly ju&s;t; becau&s;e by rea&s;on of original &s;in, we are utterly di&s;abled for the performance of the condition upon which &s;alvation is &s;u&s;pended &s;till. To remedy the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of this, new <HI>grace</HI> from God is required. Accordingly "he giveth <HI>more</HI> grace."
<Q>He gives &s;uch grace to all of us, whereby the performance of the condition, is truly po&s;&s;ible; and upon this ground he doth and may mo&s;t righteou&s;ly require it!</Q>
Thus, not only the obedience and death of Chri&s;t, but likewi&s;e all the grace of the Holy Gho&s;t which is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alva|tion, is found no more than barely &s;ufficient to &s;creen the ways of God to men, from the ju&s;t imputation of unrea|&s;onablene&s;s, and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. It is certainly difficult to conceive, how any man who really views things in this light, however much he may talk of free grace, can ever feel him&s;elf any more obliged and indebted to God, than if he had only dealt with us in a righteous manner from fir&s;t to la&s;t, never requiring more of us than we were able to do, and &s;o no occa&s;&s;ion or room had been gi|ven for any grace in the affair. And yet this view of the matter, is really as friendly to the grace of God, as any conceivable one which proceeds upon the principle, that
<PB N="19" REF="011467_0018_0F832F421849D988">
nothing more can be ju&s;tly required of us, than we have a moral as well as natural power to do.</P>
<P>BUT what I had more e&s;pecially in view here, was to enquire how it comes to pa&s;s that any in fact do not em|brace the go&s;pel, if that grace is given to every one which is &s;ufficient, in all re&s;pects, to enable him to do it. If we want the faculties of body or mind, or the oppor|tunity and means, which are nece&s;&s;ary in order to obtain the knowledge of the truth, tho&s;e difficulties mu&s;t be removed: And if we want a heart to take pains to know the truth, or to love and embrace it when di&s;covered, that difficulty al&s;o mu&s;t be removed, or el&s;e we are not, in every &s;en&s;e, <HI>enabled.</HI> It is not, in all re&s;pects, truly po&s;&s;ible that a &s;inner &s;hould come to Chri&s;t, till every thing that is incon&s;i&s;tent with his coming is removed out of the way. It is truly impo&s;&s;ible that any one &s;hould cordially embrace the go&s;pel, &s;o long as he has not &s;uch an heart in him; though it would be impo&s;&s;ible in a ve|ry different re&s;pect, if he had not external light, or natu|ral powers &s;ufficient. And now, if God gave that grace to all of us, whereby we were enabled in <HI>both</HI> the&s;e &s;en&s;es, to comply with the go&s;pel, the infallible con&s;equence mu&s;t be, that we &s;hould all of us actually do it. To &s;ay that a man has both natural and moral ability to do a thing, is the &s;ame as to &s;ay that nothing in nature is want|ing in order to his doing of it but only his own good will, <HI>nor that neither.</HI> Or, that he both could do it if he would, and is &s;ufficiently willing to. And whenever this hap|pens to be the ca&s;e, I believe it is not very likely, the thing will, after all, not be done. If in the in&s;tance be|fore us, it is really thus; if &s;inners not only could come to Chri&s;t if they would, but they have likewi&s;e all that willingne&s;s of mind, which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to their actually coming, what in the univer&s;e can ever be a&s;&s;ign|ed, as the rea&s;on why in fact they do not? This mu&s;t certainly be an event, ab&s;olutely without any cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THE truth is, when people puzzle them&s;elves upon
<PB N="20" REF="011467_0019_0F832F42DBB32408">
this &s;ubject, and in&s;i&s;t we are not accountable, and can't be blamed, any further than we have a moral as well as natural power to do otherways than we do, what their minds run upon, is only <HI>natural</HI> power after all. They may &s;ay they know what we mean by moral power, viz. that di&s;po&s;ition to do a thing which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to our doing it; and they mean the &s;ame. But however, when they get into the di&s;pute, they get bewildered, and lo&s;e &s;ight of the di&s;tinction. <HI>They</HI> don't &s;uppo&s;e an im|penitent &s;inner, going on &s;till in his tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, has a <HI>pre|&s;ent, actual</HI> di&s;po&s;ition, and a &s;ufficiently &s;trong one, to hearken to, and obey the go&s;pel. But &s;omething like this &s;eems to be in the bottom of their minds, viz. that he mu&s;t be <HI>able</HI> to be di&s;po&s;ed; or he mu&s;t have &s;uch a di&s;po&s;iton as <HI>would</HI> be &s;ufficient, if he was di&s;po&s;ed to make a good u&s;e of it. Now this is only to u&s;e the word <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> improperly, &amp; to conceive of it as a mere natu|ral power; a price in our hands, which may be u&s;ed well or ill, and which will turn to our benefit or condemnati|on, accordingly as we are di&s;po&s;ed to improve it. The di&s;po&s;ition they think of, is not in the lea&s;t degree vir|tuous, nor any ways nece&s;&s;arily connected with virtuous conduct. But it may lie &s;till, or go wrong, and will do &s;o, unle&s;s a man is di&s;pos'd and exerts him&s;elf, to make it act and keep it right. The &s;inner is not helped out of his difficulties in the lea&s;t, by having &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition as this. Yea, &s;hould we go further, and &s;ay, the impe|nitent &s;inner might have a heart to embrace the go&s;pel, <HI>if</HI> he would take proper pains in order to it; and he might do this, <HI>if</HI> he was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed; and he might be &s;o di&s;|po&s;ed <HI>if</HI> he would try; and he could try <HI>if</HI> he had a mind to. Yet, IF after all, he <HI>has not</HI> amind to try, to be di&s;|pos'd, to take any proper pains, to get a heart, to em|brace the go&s;pel, or to do any thing that is good; he is &s;till in as bad a &s;ituation as any body &s;uppo&s;es him to be in. There is no more hope of his coming to good, &s;o long as this is the ca&s;e with him, no more po&s;&s;ibility of
<PB N="21" REF="011467_0020_0F832F439663CBD8">
it; nor do we &s;ay any thing more in his favour, than if we had only &s;aid as the &s;cripture does of the fool,
<Q>that there is a price in his hand to get wi&s;dom, but he has <HI>no heart</HI> to it.</Q>
Pu&s;hing the &s;inner's moral depravity and impotence back in this manner, may get it out of the &s;ight of tho&s;e who can't &s;ee above two or three &s;teps: But this is all the good it can do. There is &s;till a defect in him <HI>&s;ome where</HI>; and &s;uch a one as will prove his ever|la&s;ting ruin, unle&s;s removed by &s;uch grace as he has ne|ver yet experienced.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t forever hold true and certain, that if &s;inners do not come to Chri&s;t, it is either becau&s;e they could not if they <HI>would</HI>; or el&s;e becau&s;e, on the whole, they are not willing to. And if, in the room of coming to Chri&s;t, we &s;hould &s;ub&s;titute &s;ome lower and preliminary conditi|on of grace and &s;alvation, it would be ju&s;t the &s;ame ca&s;e. Suppo&s;e it were u&s;ing means, praying and &s;eeking in the mo&s;t engaged manner the unregenerate &s;ometimes do; all do not come up to this; and the rea&s;on certainly is, they are under a natural, or el&s;e a moral inability of do|ing it. Either they could not &s;eek in this manner, if they would, or el&s;e they are not inclined to, but their di&s;po&s;ition is to employ their time and thoughts about other things. So that bringing down the conditions of the go&s;pel lower, in con&s;ideration of the depravity of men; or &s;uppo&s;ing common grace, whereby all are ena|bled to come up higher than they could of them&s;elves, removes no difficulties, at lea&s;t not tho&s;e de&s;ign'd to be removed, unle&s;s the way of life is &s;uppo&s;ed to be level to the inclinations of all men; or that all are in fact made willing, and actually are &s;aved.</P>
<P>ON the whole, I think the <HI>principle,</HI> that God can in ju&s;tice require of his creatures, only what he gives them a moral as well as natural power to do, mu&s;t be given up. Otherways we are reduced to a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uppo&s;ing, all the blame, if any are lo&s;t, mu&s;t lie entirely on God, and not on them. And as to tho&s;e who are &s;aved, they can
<PB N="22" REF="011467_0021_0F832F44542E84E8">
have nothing to &s;ay in his prai&s;e, but only that he has been barely ju&s;t to them. That having given his Son to obey and die, to deliver them from his law, which was an infinitely unrea&s;onable one, for fallen creatures to be under; and having given his &s;pirit to enable them to come up to the otherways impo&s;&s;ible terms of the go&s;pel, he has on the whole, dealt not unrighteou&s;ly by them. If therefore we think, there is any way to vindicate the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in the damnation of any; or that any thing can fairly be &s;aid to the prai&s;e of the glory of his grace, in the &s;alvation of them that are &s;aved, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e he is not obliged in ju&s;tice to give all of us both the kinds of ability that have been &s;poken of. And if we believe that any in fact do not obtain &s;alvation, we mu&s;t conclude they <HI>are not</HI> in both the&s;e &s;en&s;es, enabled to ob|tain it. Which was all I undertook to prove under this &s;econd head. The</P>
<P>III. THING propo&s;ed was, to con&s;ider the <HI>moral</HI> ina|ability of &s;inners in this matter.</P>
<P>THERE is not &s;o much need of labouring to confirm this, that unregenerate &s;inners have not &s;uch an heart in them, as is nece&s;&s;ary in order to a compliance with the go&s;pel; becau&s;e proving the preceeding and &s;ub&s;equent propo&s;i|tions, will infer the truth of this. If there is certainly an incapacity of the natural <HI>or</HI> moral kind, as has now been &s;hewn; and if there is certainly no <HI>natural</HI> incapacity, as I am to make appear under the next head; then certainly there mu&s;t be a <HI>moral</HI> one. Be&s;ides, I have time to treat this head but very conci&s;ely, con&s;idering the im|portance of it.</P>
<P>IT may be proper to be ob&s;erved here, that the di&s;incli|nation of &s;inners, as to &s;ome things which are pre-requi&s;ite to a compliance with the go&s;pel, is different in different per&s;ons. Though even this difference, I &s;uppo&s;e, is ow|ing to divine grace, or to more's being done for one than for another.</P>

inclination to per&s;i&s;t in his di&s;&s;olute and immo|ral practices. And there is rea&s;on to conclude, that <HI>none</HI> of this character would ever reform, and that <HI>all</HI> would <HI>be</HI> of this character, if left to their own heart's lu&s;ts, with|out any divine re&s;traints.</P>
<P>IN <HI>&s;ecure</HI> and <HI>unawakened</HI> &s;inners, there is no di&s;po&s;ition to attend to the concerns of their &s;ouls, and &s;eriou&s;ly con|&s;ider the &s;tate they are in, or to make any &s;ollicitous en|quiry about the way of &s;alvation. They
<Q>make light of the&s;e things, and go their way, one to his farm, and another to his marchandi&s;e.</Q>
And &s;uch is their attachment to the vanities of time, and their aver&s;ion to attend to things of another world, that there is no rea|&s;on to think, any one of this character, would ever be|come &s;erious, thoughtful, and engaged about his eternal well-being, if left intirely to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>awakened</HI> &s;inner, though earne&s;t in his enquiries, there is &s;till an utter want of an hone&s;t opene&s;s of mind, to admit a conviction of the truth.
<Q>He that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh he to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved.</Q>
He who&s;e
<Q>inward parts are very wickedne&s;s,</Q>
will always hate to &s;ee, and, if he can po&s;&s;ibly help it, never will believe what he really is. Hence awakened &s;inners very often, never do, and if left to them&s;elves none of them ever would, "know the plague of their own hearts." While they think they are doing all in their power to increa&s;e their convictions, they are all the while inwardly &s;triving with all their might, again&s;t conviction, and trying to find &s;ome plau&s;ible ground to think well of them&s;elves, and to e&s;tabli&s;h a righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own. Nor will they ever be &s;en&s;i|ble how "deceitful and de&s;perately wicked" their hearts are, and how hopele&s;s their ca&s;e is, in them&s;elves, till a conviction of it is forced upon them by the mo&s;t over|bearing and irre&s;i&s;table evidence.</P>
<P>AND even in the <HI>convinced</HI> &s;inner, who&s;e mouth is mo&s;t effectually &s;topped, who is forced to &s;ee that &s;in is alive
<PB N="24" REF="011467_0023_0F832F45DDBE45E8">
and has full dominion over him, and that he is indeed dead; in him who has the fulle&s;t conviction of every ne|ce&s;&s;ary truth, that any unrenew'd &s;inner ever had; there is &s;till, if nothing further is done for him, no di&s;po&s;ition heartily to approve of the law, or comply with the go&s;pel; no di&s;po&s;ition to repent truly of any of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, or receive and be dependent on Chri&s;t alone for pardon and &s;alvation; no genuine de&s;ire to be &s;aved from <HI>&s;in,</HI> or to be &s;aved from wrath in that way, in which God's ju&s;tice can be vindicated, or his grace exalted. But after all his con|victions, there remains &s;till in his heart, a mo&s;t fix'd, inve|terate, and unconquerable oppo&s;ition to all the&s;e things. Nor will he ever be cordially reconciled to God, by the mere force of truth in his con&s;cience, any more than the wicked will be at the day of judgment, or the damned in hell.</P>
<P>THAT no light, or conviction of the under&s;tanding, which the natural man is capable of receiving, can be &s;ufficient to draw, or drive, him into a true compliance with the go&s;pel, is very evident from what is &s;aid concern|ing the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration. When Nicodemus came to Chri&s;t, wanting information about the way of life, our Saviour &s;oon let him know that mere in&s;truction, even by a teacher come from God, was not all that was want|ed. Yea, that a man could <HI>receive</HI> no in&s;truction, about the kingdom of heaven, to any &s;aving purpo&s;e, unle&s;s &s;omething el&s;e was done for him fir&s;t. See John iii. 3.
<Q>Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid unto him, verily, verily I &s;ay unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</Q>
And again, to explain the matter further, ver 5.
<Q>Except a man be born of &mdash; the &s;pirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</Q>
The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a change as is meant by being born again, or born of the &s;pirit, turns upon the truth of man's being by nature, under a total moral depravity. Accordingly, our Saviour immediately adds,
<Q>That which is born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h; and that which is
<PB N="25" REF="011467_0024_0F832F46949C5248">
born of the &s;pirit, is &s;pirit.</Q>
That is, a man has no|thing truly &s;piritual or, holy, in him by the fir&s;t birth; but every thing of this kind, comes by the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t. Agreably to this, the apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays, Rom. vii. 18. "I know that in me, (that is in my fle&s;h; in my nature as far as it is unrenewed, un&s;ancti|fied, and as it was by the fir&s;t birth) there dwelleth no good thing." And in Rom. viii. 7. he &s;ays,
<Q>The carnal mind,</Q>
the mind we have as born of the fle&s;h,
<Q>is enmity again&s;t God; for it is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</Q>
He adds,
<Q>So then, they that are <HI>in the fle&s;h</HI>; cannot plea&s;e God.</Q></P>
<P>THIS is the rea&s;on we <HI>mu&s;t be born again.</HI> If there was any thing &s;piritual in us, as born of the fle&s;h, there would be no nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;econd birth. If we were not by nature <HI>dead</HI> in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, there would be no oc|ca&s;ion for our being <HI>quickened,</HI> by divine power and grace. If &s;inners were inclined at all to that which is good, they would not need to be <HI>created</HI> unto good works. If man had not <HI>wholly</HI> lo&s;t the divine likene&s;s, there would be no need of being <HI>created</HI> again
<Q>after God, in righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s.</Q>
If the
<Q>heart of the &s;ons of men</Q>
was not altogether depraved, to the very bottom of it, there would be no nece&s;&s;ity of the old "heart's being taken away, and a <HI>new</HI> one given." If men's alienation of affection from God, did not ari&s;e from <HI>unlikene&s;s</HI> to him, but only from ignorance and mi&s;appre|hen&s;ion about him, no <HI>change</HI> of nature would be at all nece&s;&s;ary. Mere light in the head, mere conviction of the under&s;tanding, would then produce a cordial reconci|liation. Yea, if a man has any degree of righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s, nothing but convictions can be want|ing, in order to his complying with the covenant of grace, and entering into the kingdom of God. He would no &s;ooner be convinced of the holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, but he would feel his heart drawn forth in love to him. He would no &s;ooner be convinced that the law
<PB N="26" REF="011467_0025_0F832F476DDCF398">
was holy, ju&s;t and good, but he would be plea&s;ed with it, and loathe him&s;elf for all his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of it. He would no &s;ooner be convinced of the unparrallel'd zeal which Chri&s;t hath &s;hewn in the cau&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and how he has magnified the law and made it honora|ble, but he would be charmed with him, and &s;ee him to be
<Q>the chiefe&s;t among ten thou&s;and, and altogether lovely.</Q>
He would no &s;ooner be convinced, of the holy tendency of all his doctrines and all his laws, but he would cordially embrace, and chearfully obey them. He would no &s;ooner under&s;tand, that his de&s;ign was to &s;ave his people from their <HI>&s;ins,</HI> but he would receive him, with all joy and thankfulne&s;s, as <HI>his</HI> Saviour and Lord.</P>
<P>BUT, if the hearts of men are totally depraved, de&s;ti|tute of righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s entirely, the ca&s;e will be quite otherways. A holy God, a holy law, a ho|ly Saviour, a holy go&s;pel, will not &s;urely, then appear love|ly in their eyes, but the contrary. Nor will a clearer un|der&s;tanding and conviction of what they really are, excite complacence and &s;atisfaction in them, but the greater a|ver&s;ion and dread. They cannot, in that ca&s;e, be cor|dially united to Chri&s;t, until <HI>his</HI> character or <HI>their's,</HI> is e&s;&s;entially changed. They can not be <HI>drawn</HI> to him, unle&s;s by force, and again&s;t their wills, till either <HI>he</HI> cea&s;es to be what he is, or <HI>they</HI> are made new creatures. For
<Q>an unju&s;t man is an abomination to the ju&s;t; and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.</Q>
And,
<Q>what fellow&s;hip hath righteou&s;ne&s;s with unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s? And what communion hath light with dark|ne&s;s? And what concord hath Chri&s;t with Belial?</Q></P>
<P>CAN a man who&s;e heart is wholly corrupt, and unho|ly, chu&s;e the holy Je&s;us for his Lord and Saviour, and cordially embrace the pure and holy doctrines and pre|cepts of his go&s;pel? Can one who is really and at heart, wholly in love with the &s;ervice of Satan, inli&s;t, with any &s;incerity, into the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t, all who&s;e work and bu&s;ine&s;s is,
<Q>to de&s;troy the works of the de|vil?</Q>
<PB N="27" REF="011467_0026_0F832F4830CF8778">
Can one who is all the while
<Q>an enemy in his mind to God,</Q>
yea, who&s;e
<Q>mind is enmity it&s;elf again&s;t God,</Q>
be delighted with the character and ways of his well-beloved Son, who is
<Q>the brightne&s;s of the Father's glory, and the very image of his per&s;on?</Q>
Can one who
<Q>is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be,</Q>
be &s;ubject to the Mediator, or &s;uited with his conduct in being obedient even unto death, to condemn &s;in and do honor to the divine law? Can one who is an enemy to all righteou&s;ne&s;s, be plea&s;ed with Chri&s;t in this view of his character, plea&s;ed with him, "for his righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake," and for the zeal he has &s;hewn to "magnify the law and make it honorable?"</P>
<P>THIS is the rea&s;on the Father is well plea&s;ed in him as Mediator. And "all that come unto God by him," mu&s;t be plea&s;ed with him in this view al&s;o. There can be no true reconciliation between God and man, unle&s;s both parties acquie&s;ce, and are &s;uited with what the Me|diator has done; and that con&s;idered in the &s;ame point of light. God is well plea&s;ed, indeed, with the love Chri&s;t has &s;hown for lo&s;t men. For the Father was always as benevolently di&s;pos'd towards this fallen world, as the Son was. But yet had he not as Mediator, &s;hown a proper regard to truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s; had he not "condemned the &s;in of men," and
<Q>given to God the glory that was due unto his name,</Q>
the holy Gover|nor of the world could not have acqui&s;ced in his media|tion.
<Q>The Lord was well plea&s;ed for his righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake.</Q>
And if we are not plea&s;ed with him in <HI>this</HI> view, but merely for the &s;ake of his <HI>kindne&s;s</HI> and <HI>good|will</HI> to men, we do not come into his plan of reconcili|ation and of peace. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>If that view of the amiablene&s;s of Chri&s;t, and that well plea&s;edne&s;s with his mediation, which is implied in a compliance with the go&s;pel, had nothing more in it than only &s;eeing it to be a beautiful thing in him to feel &s;o much interre&s;ted in <HI>our</HI> welfare, and willing to do and &s;uffer &s;o much to &s;ave <HI>us</HI> from mi&s;ery and ruin; then indeed, no change of na|ture in the mo&s;t depraved creature would be nece&s;&s;ary in order to it. We may be as wholly &s;elfi&s;h and regardle&s;s of God's glory as any &s;inner over was, and yet be greatly charmed with the meditation of Chri&s;t, view'd only in the favourable a&s;pect it has upon our intere&s;t. And, un|doubtedly, thou&s;ands have been fatally deceiv'd in this manner. Taking this for a di&s;covery of "the gory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t," and the effects of it for conver&s;ion and &s;anctification. For &s;uch a view of Chri&s;t and of God through him, will, under certain circum&s;tances, pro|duce a &s;ort of repentance, love and obedience, in one who was, and con|tinues to be, intirely void of real holine&s;s. Let a &s;inner only have an impre&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;e of the dreadfulne&s;s of damnation, and of his danger of it, and in the mid&s;t of this have the love of Chri&s;t, and what he has done &amp; &s;uffered for &s;inners, come &s;uddenly into his mind, in a manner that makes him believe, or at lea&s;t &s;trongly hope, he is one of the happy number for whom Chri&s;t laid down his life; and is it po&s;&s;ible but that be &s;hould be filled with comfort and joy, and have his affections greatly drawn forth towards &s;uch a kind and almighty Saviour? And when lie comes now to view God in Chri&s;t as his reconciled God and father he will naturally feel quite otherways affected towards him too. When he believes God has loved him with an everla&s;ting love, and elected him from eternity to be a ve&s;&s;el of mercy and an heir of glory; his enmity again&s;t him will hereup|on naturally &s;ub&s;ide; he will nece&s;&s;arily be a&s;hamed and grieved that he has had &s;uch unworthy thoughts of him, and has behaved &s;o un&s;uitably towards him. And &s;uch an apprehen&s;ion of his new &s;tate, and of God's great goodne&s;s, may produce a la&s;ting alteration in his life. He may be very zealous in religion; and po&s;&s;ibly very regular in his morals likewi&s;e Here then, is faith, repentance, love, and new obedience, without the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for any conformity to God in true holine&s;s from fir&s;t to la&s;t. Such things as the&s;e are the natural growth of the human heart under &s;uch rain and &s;un&s;hine. There is no need of any alteration in the &s;oil, or of any foreign &s;eed &s;own in it.</P>
<P>THIS may be more clearly conceived, by the help of a &s;imilitude. Let us then, &s;uppo&s;e a king that is &s;trictly ju&s;t in his admini&s;tration; for|biding, on very &s;evere penalties, all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s among his &s;ubjects, and very thorough in &s;eeing that ju&s;tice is duly executed on all offenders. A number of his &s;ubjects, who are viciou&s;ly inclind, are unea&s;y under &s;uch re&s;traints, and grow di&s;affecteed to their &s;overeign, and at length form a con&s;piracy to dethrone him. But before they are quite ripe for execut|ing it, their plot is happily di&s;covered. They are taken and brought to judgment; found guilty, and condemn'd to die. Their hatred again&s;t their prince is hereby greatly increa&s;ed. One of them, however, is exceed|ingly dejected in &s;pirit, at the thoughts of his approaching execution. For &s;ome time he remains in pri&s;on with the re&s;t, in fearful expectation that every day may be his la&s;t. But in the mid&s;t of his greate&s;t anxiety, a me&s;&s;en|ger at la&s;t arrives with a gracious pardon. He is delivered from pri&s;on and from death. Yea, his offended &s;overeign has &s;et his heart &s;o peculiarly upon him, that in&s;tead of having him executed with his fellow criminals, he is determined to make him a particular favourite at court, and rai&s;e him to honor and wealth, far exceeding his former condition before he became a rebel and a traitor. How great is the &s;urpri&s;e! how in&s;upportably the joy, upon hearing all this! the wretch's enmity and hatred is quite o|vercome. E&s;pecially if he now under&s;tands that the king had always a particular kindne&s;s for <HI>him,</HI> and never de&s;ign'd any penal laws &s;hould be executed upon him, let him do what he would. He is fill'd with the mo&s;t admiring &s;entiments of his injured gracious &s;overeign, and loves him above all men in the world. But hardly dares to look up to him, he is &s;o a&s;hamed of his former temper towards him, and the black de&s;ign he had meditated again&s;t his crown and life. All this does not &s;uppo&s;e any alteration in the rebels real character. All this may be, and undoubtedly will be, though his vicious di&s;po&s;ition, which fir&s;t gave ri&s;e to his di&s;affec|tion to his prince, &s;till remains in its full &s;trength. There is no need of his becoming a new man, a friend to righteou&s;ne&s;s and an enemy to ini|quity, in order to his becoming in this manner, a warm friend to his royal <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and benefactor, con&s;idered merely as &s;uch. He may be &s;o all his days; may be one of the foremo&s;t in his commendation at lea&s;t in extolling the great things he has done for him; and he may behave excellently well when under the kings eye, or when he expects, he will hear of it, with a view to plea&s;e him, and yet be at heart as unrighteous a creature as ever he was, even to his dying day.</P>
<P>Now &s;uch a kind of reconciliation to <HI>God,</HI> will naturally take place in a &s;inner, if he is only effectually terrified with the thoughts of "dwelling with devouting fire, and inhabiting everla&s;ting burnings;" and then gets a hope of God's love. There is no need of being born again, or ever hav|ing any thing of the moral likene&s;s of God, in order to it. Yea, there is no need of conviction, in order to &s;uch a conver&s;ion as this. I mean a conviction of the equitablene&s;s and moral fitne&s;s of the divine admini&s;tra|tion. Light, concerning the holine&s;s and ju&s;tice, wi&s;dom or general good|ne&s;s of God, is not what produces &s;uch a change as this; nor is it any ways nece&s;&s;ary in order to it. Accordingly per&s;ons of this kind of piety, have no great concern to know what God is in him&s;elf, but only what he is to them. They have no notion of entering much into the nature and ends of his law, or of the go&s;pel, and &s;eeing into the divine character and glory as thereby exhibited. The&s;e are matters of empty &s;peculation with them; things which vital piety has nothing to do with. They know as much about God's general character; as much about the things the P&s;al|mi&s;t prayed that his eyes might be opened to behold; as much about "the things the angels de&s;ire to look into," as ever they expect or want to.</P>
<P>THESE may perhaps not improperly be denominated antinomians; though they are divided into a variety of &s;ects and contending parties up|on particular que&s;tions, about the faith which is not founded in holine&s;s, but which is the foundation of every thing.</P>
<P>SOME &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t, that no faith can admini&s;ter hope and comfort enough to make men truly good, &s;hort of "a full per&s;ua&s;ion and confi|dence of our <HI>own</HI> &s;alvation." Or, a being well &s;atisfied "of our recon|ciliation with God, and of our future enjoyment of everla&s;ting heavenly happine&s;s." To get this per&s;ua&s;ion is the grand &s;ecret, or "my&s;tery of &s;anctification." To <HI>give</HI> this per&s;ua&s;ion without any evidence of it's truth, and even while it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be in fact not true, is the great work of the Holy Gho&s;t, begetting "an inclination, and propen&s;ity of heart, to the practice of holine&s;s."&mdash;Others, not &s;o fond of my&s;tery, or not &s;o well un|der&s;tanding "the way of manufacturing truth without evidence," and of making a fal&s;ehood true, by the pains taken to believe it; chu&s;e rather to &s;uppo&s;e, "the &s;imple truth," or general report of the go&s;pel, beat ef|fectually into a man's <HI>head,</HI> when "he is thoroughly pinched with the impo&s;&s;ibility of hope, on every other &s;ide, will give &s;uch a refre&s;hment to his mind," as will do the whole work. That
<Q>many in all ages, only on hearing this, have become quite a&s;hamed of their former rebellion, have been led to love their &s;overeign, and encouraged to do tho&s;e things which are well plea&s;ing in his &s;ight; and accordingly have known what it was to &s;tand in his pre&s;ence, and have their joy made full in behold|ing the light of his countenance.</Q>
The faith that does all this, they would have a bare per&s;ua&s;ion, or conviction in the under&s;tanding, of what is called the truth; leaving the heart to take care of it&s;elf. This, we are told, &s;ome call <HI>the faith of devils.</HI> But that
<Q>however keen the intended reproach be, it can have weight with none but &s;uch as are &s;wayed by &s;ound in&s;tead of &s;en&s;e. For, according to the &s;cripture, the &s;ame truth which &s;aves Chri&s;t's people torments the devil's. So we find them &s;aying <HI>what have we to do with thee, Je&s;us, thou &s;on of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</HI> they believe, they hate, and yet they tremble at that truth which Chri&s;t's people believe, love and find &s;alvation in.</Q>
The difference then, in the affections excited by a belief of the go&s;pel, in the minds of true believers and devils, ari&s;es intirely from the different circum&s;tances they are under, and not from a|ny difference in their tempers. The devils hate to be tormented, and Chri&s;t's people love to be treated kindly and made happy. So the &s;ame belief of the &s;ame truth, which excites the hatred and horror of the for|mer, fills the latter with joy and love. This difference is not hard to di&s;cern; and is naturally enough accounted for. But how any one, who is not &s;wayed by &s;ound in&s;tead of &s;en&s;e, &s;hould think of making more of this than only a circum&s;tantial difference, is not &s;o ea&s;y to be conceived. A bare change of place and external treatment, would <HI>make</HI> devils of &s;uch converts; and &s;uch converts of devils, in a moment. They being after all e&s;&s;entially, exactly alike.</P>
<P>THIS way of affecting all the alteration wanted in wicked men, merely by notious in the head, however firmly credited, and whether true or fal&s;e, whether called an appropriating faith, or a &s;imple belief, or by whatever other name, mu&s;t forever leave a change of nature quite out of the que&s;tion. Indeed it evidently proceeeds upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that there is really no difference, between &s;aints and &s;inners, angels and devils, only they are treated differently, or &s;ome don't <HI>under&s;tand</HI> things &s;o well as others.</P></NOTE></P>

Nor would better natural abilities than they have, be of the lea&s;t &s;ervice to them.

And the rea&s;on of this is as obvious, as the fact is certain; viz. becau&s;e whatever &s;trength any one has, he always lays it out according to his own heart, and not contrary to it.

Could he have divine power at his &s;ervice, according to his utmo&s;t wi&s;h, it would not be to change his heart, but to enable him to act it out without controul. If therefore, &s;inners on|ly knew what hearts they have, this alone would bring them to di&s;pair of help from them&s;elves, let their natu|ral

And a &s;elf determined determination, contrary to a man's heart, were &s;uch a thing po&s;&s;ible, would be no more thanks to him, than the ha|ving his heart changed by divine power.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JOHN VI. 44.</BIBL>
<P>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath &s;ent me draw him.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE general ob&s;ervation rai&s;ed from the&s;e words, was to this effect,</P>
<P>THAT no man is able to comply with the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, without the effectual grace of God.</P>
<P>A principal thing I had in view, was to clear this doc|trine of the common objection in men's minds again&s;t it, as if it repre&s;ented the Mo&s;t High, as being in&s;incere and unrighteous in his dealings with &s;inners. Offering them &s;alvation on terms he knows they cannot come up to; and then condemning and puni&s;hing them, for their non-com|pliance with &s;uch impo&s;&s;ible conditions. Accordingly, I undertook, in the fir&s;t place, to explain and illu&s;trate a di&s;tinction of two kinds of inability; and to &s;hew that men are, not unfrequently, in common &s;peech, and &s;cripture,
<PB N="34" REF="011467_0033_0F832F4D684449E0">
&s;aid to be incapable of actions which are their aver&s;ion, or which they have not an inclination to, as well as of things which they could not do if they were &s;o di&s;po&s;ed. As likewi&s;e, that there is a real occa&s;ion for u&s;ing this and the like expre&s;&s;ions, in &s;uch a manner. There being, in|deed, an ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of a man's acting other|ways than agreeably to his own heart, as well as there is of his doing things which exceed his natural &s;trength.</P>
<P>Secondly; I endeavoured to &s;hew, that &s;inners while they actually neglect the great &s;alvation, are certainly un|able, in one or the other of the&s;e &s;en&s;es, not to neglect it. That &s;o long as they <HI>do not</HI> come to Chri&s;t, it mu&s;t be true that they want, either &s;uch natural ability, or el&s;e &s;uch a heart, as is nece&s;&s;ary in order to their coming to him.</P>
<P>Thirdly; I con&s;idered the moral depravity of &s;inners, &s;hewing that they have &s;uch an evil heart to depart from the living God, that until their natures are changed, it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould come to Chri&s;t, or chu&s;e him &amp; his &s;alvation. We are come now, to the</P>
<P N="4">IV. AND la&s;t head propo&s;ed; viz. To prove that &s;in|ners labour under no other impo&s;&s;ibility of complying with the go&s;pel, but only what ari&s;es from their di&s;incli|nation to it; or from the badne&s;s of their hearts.</P>
<P>I DO not mean, however, nor will any under&s;tand me, to a&s;&s;ert this, with re&s;pect to every <HI>individual</HI> of the human race. For as the apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, "how &s;hall men be|lieve in him of whom they have not heard? and how &s;hall they hear without a preacher?"</P>
<P>THERE are, undoubtedly, a great many in the world, who, in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, could not get the knowledge of the go&s;pel way of life, if their hearts were good. There are &s;ome that have not the means of grace; there are others that have not the u&s;e of rea&s;on; and there are others who have not, and never had, the &s;en&s;e of hear|ing. It is not a&s;&s;erted concerning any of the&s;e, that they are not under a natural incapacity to come to Chri&s;t.
<PB N="35" REF="011467_0034_0F832F4E1D74CD50">
But what I undertake to evince, is only, that per&s;ons who have ordinary intellectual powers, and bodily &s;en&s;es, and are arrived to years of di&s;cretion, and live under the light of the go&s;pel, labour under no natural inability to obtain &s;alvation: But that if they cannot comply with the re|vealed way of life, it mu&s;t be owing intirely to their di&s;|inclination to it, or to the badne&s;s of their hearts.</P>
<P>THERE are multitudes that evidently do not view the matter in this light. It is needful therefore, that this point &s;hould be laboured a little particularly. The</P>
<P N="1">1. ARG. I &s;hall make u&s;e of for the confirmation of it is, that it is not God's u&s;ual way, to require natural im|po&s;&s;ibilities of any of his creatures; and to condemn them for not doing, what they could not, if they would.</P>
<P>GOD commands none of us to fly above the clouds, or to overturn the mountains by the roots; or to do any <HI>&s;uch kind</HI> of impo&s;&s;ibilities. Yea, we are particularly told in his word, that
<Q>if there be fir&s;t a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</Q>
If a man has but little e&s;tate, it is not expected or required that he &s;hould give away a great deal to pious or charitable u&s;es. If a poor widow ca&s;ts in two mites, when it is all &s;he has, it is as well accepted as if it were <HI>two millions.</HI> If a man has never &s;o little &s;trength, of body or of mind, a willing exertion and good improve|ment of that little, is all that is required of him. This is exceeding evident from tho&s;e &s;ummaries of the whole law, which we have both in the old te&s;tament, and in the new. Mo&s;es &s;ays, Dieut. 10.12.
<Q>And now I&s;rael, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to &s;erve the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul?</Q>
And our Saviour, in an&s;wer to the que&s;tion of the &s;cribe, which is the great commandment in the law?" &s;ays, Mat. 22 37&mdash;40, and Mark 12, 30.
<Q>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all
<PB N="36" REF="011467_0035_0F832F4EDF002C28">
Thy mind, and with all thy &s;trength. This is the fir&s;t and great commandment. And the &s;econd is like un|to it, thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf. On the&s;e two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</Q></P>
<P>IT is evident from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, that the whole law, in the highe&s;t perfection of it, is level to &s;ome kind of capacity which men &s;till have, in the pre&s;ent fallen &s;tate. We are not to &s;uppo&s;e, indeed, it is their moral capacity; or that all the Lord our God requires of us, is only to love and fear and &s;erve him, as much as we are di&s;po&s;ed to. This would be no <HI>law</HI> at all. It would be a di&s;pen|&s;ation from all law; a liberty for every one to walk in the way of his own heart, and treat the Deity ju&s;t as his incli|nation leads him. We are not to &s;uppo&s;e a perfect law, can come down any lower, than to require a perfect heart, and a perfectly good improvement of all the talents and &s;trength we have. And it is evident, neither Mo&s;es, nor our Saviour, under&s;tood the divine law as requiring more than this. To love and &s;erve God, with all the heart, &s;oul, mind and &s;trength, cannot mean more than to the utmo&s;t extent of our natural abilities, be they greater or le&s;s. Some men are not capable of &s;o high a degree of love to God as others, though they are equally upright and well-di&s;po&s;ed; becau&s;e their mental powers are not &s;o great; or their advantages to get the knowledge of God have not been &s;o good. In like manner &s;ome cannot <HI>do</HI> &s;o much for God, for want of opportunity, &amp;c. Now all proper allowences are made in the divine law, for things of this nature. The more any one has of intellectual or bodily &s;trength, or outward advantages; the more is re|quired of him; and the le&s;s any one has of the&s;e, the le&s;s is required. As to loving our neighbour as our&s;elves; this is undoubtedly equally in the power of the weak and of the &s;trong, of him that is capable of higher and lower degrees of affection, provided he is equally upright di&s;in|tere&s;ted and impartial.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="011467_0036_0F832F4F945AEC18">ON the whole, I think it is exceeding plain and evident, that God in his holy and righteous law, requires no im|po&s;&s;ibilities of any of us, but what become &s;o by rea&s;on of our pre&s;ent evil temper of mind, and unwillingne&s;s to ex|ert the natural &s;trength we have in the manner we ought. And now, if we have natural powers &s;ufficient for under|&s;tanding and doing our whole duty; and nothing hinders any of us from coming up to all that &s;inle&s;s perfection, which is required in God's perfect law, but only our own wicked hearts; I conclude few will think any thing el&s;e hinders &s;inners of ordinary capacity, who enjoy the out|ward means of grace, from repenting and complying with the go&s;pel. A</P>
<P N="2">II. ARG. that &s;inners who enjoy the external light of the go&s;pel, are not under a natural impo&s;&s;ibility of com|plying with and obeying it, may be drawn from what the &s;criptures plainly teach, and what is generally believed, concerning the great difference that will be made betwixt &s;uch &s;inners, and tho&s;e who never heard of a Saviour, as to their final condemnation and puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>OUR Saviour let tho&s;e cities where he had chiefly preached and wrought his miracles, know, that their fi|nal doom would be much the heavier for it; and that it would be more tolerable for even Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgement, than for them. But this, and what is commonly &s;aid, about the great guilt of go&s;pel &s;inners above others, &s;urely &s;uppo&s;es that there is &s;ome difference between them and the heathen, as to a po&s;&s;ibi|lity of their under&s;tanding the way of life, and attaining &s;alvation. It &s;uppo&s;es the former have a real price in their hands, which the latter have not. But if the go&s;pel &s;in|ner is under a natural inability to repent and believe in Chri&s;t, an inability ari&s;ing from any thing el&s;e be&s;ides his own heart, this could not &s;urely be the ca&s;e. Why &s;hould one who is, &amp; always has been, &s;o weak or di&s;ordered in his intellect, as to be incapable of under&s;tanding the go&s;pel, be thought a greater &s;inner for living in a chri&s;tian land?
<PB N="38" REF="011467_0037_0F832F505387ADF8">
We do not think this is the ca&s;e as to idiots, or quite deli|rious per&s;ons. We do not think they will have more to an|&s;wer for than the heathen will. But if we believe a natural impo&s;&s;ibility is required of men in this ca&s;e, becau&s;e their natural capacity was impaired or lo&s;t by the fall: then for the &s;ame rea&s;on we might expect, that the heathen who never heard of the go&s;pel, and natural fools who can under&s;tand nothing about it, would be puni&s;hed for not embracing it, as much as any. For they would not have been under tho&s;e di&s;advantages had it not been for the a|po&s;tacy.</P>
<P>ARG. III. IT is expre&s;ly attributed in &s;cripture, to the evil hearts of men, as the &s;ole cau&s;e of impenitence and unbelief under the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>AND it ought to be particularly ob&s;erved, that this is done with profe&s;s'd de&s;ign to &s;et a&s;ide the plea of ignorance, which &s;inners are &s;o exceeding apt to harp upon; and to let them &s;ee that they are without excu&s;e.
<Q>This is the condemnation,</Q>
our Saviour &s;ays,
<Q>that light is come into the world; and men have loved darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds are evil.</Q>
In another place he &s;ays,
<Q>if ye were blind, ye had not had &s;in; but now ye &s;ay we &s;ee, therefore your &s;in remaineth.</Q>
And again;
<Q>if I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had &s;in: but now have they both &s;een, and hated both me and my father. Now they have no cloke for their &s;in.</Q>
That is, if they had not had tho&s;e powers of mind, or tho&s;e means of conviction that were nece&s;&s;ary, it is true, they would not have been to blame, it would have been no &s;in in them, not to have believed in and received me as their Me&s;&s;iah. But now when their under&s;tandings are good enough; and when means, powerful and &s;ufficient external means have been u&s;ed with them; their unbelief and rejec|tion of me, can be owing to nothing but the de&s;pe|rate wickedne&s;s of their hearts. It is <HI>knowledge</HI> and not <HI>ignorance</HI> of my character, that is the &s;pring of their hatred. Or if any of them are ignorant, it is their own fault.
<PB N="39" REF="011467_0038_0F832F5113AEA2A0">
There is light enough, only they hate it, and will not come to it.</P>
<P>ARG. IV. That it is not owing to weakne&s;s of the un|der&s;tanding, or any natural defect, that &s;inners in ge|neral under the go&s;pel are not &s;aved, is evident from the inferior abilities of many of tho&s;e who actually ob|tain &s;alvation,</P>
<P>IT is not men of the &s;tronge&s;t and brighte&s;t genius, and they only, that under&s;tand and embrace the go&s;pel; but they are per&s;ons of very ordinary powers of mind, as of|ten if not oftener than any.
<Q>Ye &s;ee your calling bre|thren,</Q>
&s;ays the Apo&s;tle to the Corinthians,
<Q>how that not many <HI>wi&s;e</HI> men after the fle&s;h,&mdash;are called. But God hath cho&s;en the fooli&s;h things of the world, and the weak things to confound the mighty,</Q>
&amp;c. And our Saviour &s;ays,
<Q>I thank thee, O father, Lord of heaven and earth, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them un|to babes. Even &s;o, father, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight.</Q>
Though God be&s;tows the &s;pecial influen|ces of his grace, ju&s;t where and when he plea&s;es, or as &s;eemeth good in his &s;ight, yet he has doubtle&s;s always a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for fixing upon the particular objects of his &s;overeign mercy, exactly as he does. We are not to conceive of it, as a blind partiality, but a wi&s;e &s;overeignty, that is exerci&s;ed in this matter. The rea&s;on why not many of the noble and honorable are called, but rather the ba&s;e and &s;uch as are di&s;pi&s;ed, is, we are told, that no fle&s;h &s;hould glory in his pre&s;ence. And the rea&s;on why it &s;eemeth good in the &s;ight of God, to hide the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and to reveal them unto babes, may be, and undoubtedly one rea&s;on of it is, that hereby it may be made evident, it is not owing to the &s;uperior &s;trength of men's natural powers that they di&s;cover the &s;trait and narrow way which leadeth unto life; nor to their weakne&s;s, in re&s;pect of natural abilities, that they do not. If babes are able to &s;ee the &s;uitablene&s;s and
<PB N="40" REF="011467_0039_0F832F51E4631810">
glory of the go&s;pel way of &s;alvation, unque&s;tionably, wi&s;e men might, were it not for &s;omething be&s;ides weakne&s;s of under&s;tanding, or any deficiency in the intellect merely. It is evident from hence, that natural weakne&s;s can be no in&s;uperable bar in the way of man's obtaining &s;alvation, unle&s;s they are weaker than babes.</P>
<P>ARG. V. AT lea&s;t this will be undeniably evident, if we con&s;ider what is done for a per&s;on when <HI>the&s;e things are revealed unto him</HI>; or when he is made to &s;ee
<Q>the things of the &s;pirit of God, as they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</Q></P>
<P>GOD does not reveal any new truths, not contained in his written word; nor does he give any new faculties to per&s;ons, or enlarge their natural powers of body or of mind, when he enables them to believe and obey the go&s;|pel. But what he does for them, is to alter the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of their hearts. If we found all that became real chri&s;tians, however weak before, were immediately afterwards, per&s;ons of genius and abilities &s;uperior to all other men, we &s;hould, indeed, have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the unregenerate wanted better under&s;tandings, rather than better hearts, in order to their being able truly to know Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the way of life. But this is not the ca&s;e. It is the heart that is created a-new, when one becomes a good man, and not the head. We find the natural powers of men are the &s;ame after regeneration as before; and often far inferior to many of their neighbours, who have experienced no &s;uch change. It is true, the wi&s;dom of good men runs in another channel; they are wi&s;e to do good, and apt to get divine knowledge; but that is only becau&s;e they have a ta&s;te for the&s;e things, and are di&s;po&s;ed to take pains about them.
<Q>The children of this world are, in their generation, <HI>wi&s;er</HI> than the chil|dren of light.</Q>
They pro&s;ecute their own &s;chemes, &amp; make proficiency in what they turn their hands to, and &s;et their hearts upon, beyond what good men do in the things of virtue and religion. What makes good men &s;ee the
<PB N="41" REF="011467_0040_0F832F529918C248">
glory of God, which others can perceive nothing of, is not their having more &s;peculative knowledge about the divine character, than others have, or are capable of; but their being conformed to God in temper &amp; in heart; con|formed to him "in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s." This, indeed, makes divine things, and all things of a mo|ral nature, appear in quite a new light; &amp; hence they are &s;aid to be <HI>renewed in knowledge.</HI> He that is altogether unholy, let his head be never &s;o clear, and his &s;pecula|tive knowledge never &s;o great, cannot have all that per|ception of holine&s;s, which the weake&s;t &s;aint has, who feels the opperation and power of it in his own heart. There is no knowledge like that we get by experience. A man that has never felt a particular kind of pain, we &s;ay, can have no idea of it; &s;o of parental affection, one who has never experienced it, knows not what it is. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of all kinds of &s;en&s;ations and affections; the experiencing them, gives a knowledge of them that can no otherways be obtained. And this holds true with re&s;pect to holy exerci&s;es and affections as much as any other. Hence, tho&s;e who are made
<Q>partakers of a di|vine nature,</Q>
or who have
<Q>put on the new man which after God is created in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s,</Q>
are capable of a kind of knowledge of God, which is peculiar to them&s;elves. Accordingly the apo&s;|tle John &s;ays,
<Q>Every one that loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.</Q>
1 John iv. 7, 8. He who is acquainted with the feelings of univer&s;al benevolence, in his own brea&s;t, has a different idea of him who
<Q>is good unto all, and who&s;e tender mercies are over all his works,</Q>
than he who&s;e heart is contracted, and who is truly good to none, has, or is capable of. Particular|ly; he who is conformed in heart to God, &s;ees a beauty in his character and government, which no one of an intirely oppo&s;ite temper can po&s;&s;ibly do. The rea&s;on is, whatever any one regards, and is zealous about, he is
<PB N="42" REF="011467_0041_0F832F565EE489F0">
nece&s;&s;arily plea&s;ed to &s;ee others regard, and be engaged in promoting. Thus if a man values his own particular intere&s;t or reputation, as every one does, he is thence un|avoidably plea&s;ed to &s;ee others tender of it, and di&s;po|&s;ed to promote it. And if a man is benevolently con|cerned for the public intere&s;t, he will in like manner be peculiarly delighted to &s;ee others public &s;pirited and zea|lou&s;ly aiming to &s;ecure and advance the general good. The intirely &s;elfi&s;h &s;oul, feels as if his own private hap|pine&s;s was the mo&s;t valuable, yea the <HI>only</HI> valuable thing in all the univer&s;e. Hence if he can only believe, God has &s;et his kinde&s;t love on <HI>him,</HI> from eternity; and &s;ent his only Son from his bo&s;om to die for <HI>his</HI> &s;ake, (whe|ther nece&s;&s;ary or unnece&s;&s;ary, wi&s;e or unwife, right or wrong, it matters not;) this gives him the mo&s;t exalted, the mo&s;t glorious conception, of the parent and lord of all worlds, that his narrow &s;oul can po&s;&s;ibly contain.&mdash;But, to him that is born of God, and a&s;&s;imulated in temper, to his father which is in heaven, things will appear in a quite different light. To him who is made to be in any mea&s;ure of a true, a God-like public &s;pirit, an impartial, infinite di&s;po&s;ition to maintain univer&s;al order, to pro|mote univer&s;al good, is the grand, the infinite beauty.</P>
<P>To have the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, or the &s;ame mind that was in him, is, in like manner, the only thing that can ena|ble a per&s;on to have that &s;en&s;e which all &s;aints have, of the greatne&s;s and glory of his redeeming love. Hence it was the apo&s;tle Paul's prayer for the Ephe&s;ians,
<Q>that they being <HI>rooted</HI> and <HI>grounded</HI> in love, might be able to comprehend with <HI>all &s;aints,</HI> what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Chri&s;t, which pa&s;&s;eth knowledge.</Q>
Eph. iii, 17, 18, 19.</P>
<P>AND to have a heavenly, that is, a holy temper and &s;pi|rit, is nece&s;&s;ary in order to have a true under&s;tanding of any thing heavenly; any thing of
<Q>the inheritance of the &s;aints in light,</Q>
or of what
<Q>God hath prepared
<PB N="43" REF="011467_0042_0F832F5711D05938">
for them that love him.</Q>
This the Apo&s;tle very par|ticularly and largely takes notice of, in 1 Cor. ii, 11&mdash;15. "For what man," &s;ays he,
<Q>knoweth the things of a man, &s;ave the &s;pirit of man which is in him?</Q>
The <HI>&s;pirit of man</HI>; the narrowne&s;s, pride, and various corrupt affections by which mankind are actuated, would be very incomprehen&s;ible to us, did we not feel, and had we never felt, any thing of the &s;ame in our own brea&s;ts. We &s;hould be perfectly amazed to &s;ee how men act, not being able to conceive what inward feelings or principles &s;hould ex|cite them to behave in &s;uch a manner.&mdash;The <HI>things of a man</HI>; the enjoyments which fallen creatures &s;o fondly dote on, and &s;o eagerly pur&s;ue after, to one who never had a|ny thing of their &s;pirit, it would be inconceivable how there could be any thing gratifying, or agreeable in them, to any mortal.&mdash;
<Q>So the things of God knoweth no man, but the &s;pirit of God.</Q>
The enjoyments of reli|gion and of heaven, can no more be perceived to have a|ny thing in them, by one who is intirely de&s;titute of a di|vine and heavenly temper.&mdash;
<Q>Now we have received, not the &s;pirit of the world, but the &s;pirit which is of God; that we might know <HI>the things that are freely given to us of God.</HI></Q>
That is, the holy delights &amp; enter|tainments provided for &s;aints in a future world.
<Q>Which things al&s;o we &s;peak, not in the words which man's wi&s;dom teacheth, but which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth; comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual.</Q>
&mdash;In de&s;crib|ing the&s;e future glories and felicities, we do not make u&s;e of &s;uch language as a carnal ta&s;te would &s;ugge&s;t, or as would be thought the true &s;ublime, by the wi&s;e of this world: but we &s;peak of them in a manner to which we are led by the &s;pirit of holine&s;s. To give us the mo&s;t ele|vated ideas of the joys to be expected in heaven, we com|pare them, not with the idolized po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and delights of time and &s;en&s;e, but with tho&s;e &s;piritual enjoyments, tho&s;e holy exerci&s;es and gratifications, which true &s;aints experience, in &s;ome low degree, in this lower world.&mdash;
<Q><PB N="44" REF="011467_0043_0F832F5A5029F080">But the natural man receiveth not the things of the &s;pi|rit of God: for they are fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him; neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cern|ed.</Q>
&mdash;The unrenewed &s;inner, having nothing &s;piritu|al in him, to compare &s;piritual things with, being a &s;trang|er to &s;piritual joys, or the feelings and plea&s;ures of a truly virtuous mind, they will nece&s;&s;arily &s;eem empty, out of the way things to him; nor can he perceive their true excel|lence and worth, becau&s;e their being perceived thus, de|pends intirely upon the &s;pirit and temper a man is of.</P>
<P>IT appears from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, that it is neither the hav|ing new truths &s;ugge&s;ted, that are not contained in the &s;criptures; nor the having the under&s;tanding convinced of the truths contained in them; nor the having new fa|culties of mind given, or the old ones enlarged, or mend|ed, or any how made better, that enables a man to &s;ee God, or Chri&s;t, or heavenly things, as &s;aints &s;ee them. But that a foundation is, and can be laid for this, only by a man's becoming a &s;aint, or having a new &s;pirit given him; <HI>the &s;pirit which is of God.</HI></P>
<P>IN a word; whatever is &s;aid by &s;ome about rectifying the natural faculties, it is very generally agreed, that re|generation is not a <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> change, but a <HI>moral</HI> one. That it con&s;i&s;ts, not in making men <HI>great,</HI> but in making them <HI>good.</HI> That the new creation, is nothing el&s;e but the mo|ral image of God, con&s;i&s;ting in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s. But if the&s;e things are &s;o, then certainly all the inability that is removed, and con&s;equently all that wants to be removed, by the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t, is intirely of a moral nature. An inability which altogether con&s;i&s;ts, in the want of an hone&s;t and good heart.</P>
<P>ARG. VI. This way of conceiving of the impotence of fallen men, does not fru&s;trate, but tends mo&s;t of all to advance and magnify, the grace of God.</P>
<P>UNDOUBTEDLY that view of the inability of man, which is mo&s;t ea&s;ily and fairly reconcilable with the ju&s;tice of God, ought to be embraced, provided it does not de|rogate

from the freene&s;s and riches of divine grace, in the &s;inners &s;alvation. Now I pre&s;ume there are few, but what are &s;en&s;ible of &s;ome difficulty, in reconciling God's requir|ing natural impo&s;&s;ibilities of us, with any notions we have of ju&s;tice. As if he &s;hould require a man to fly, or lift a million weight, or make a world. And &s;hould &s;u&s;pend his &s;alvation on the condition of his doing &s;uch things as the&s;e, which are evidently beyond the capacity of any man, let his di&s;po&s;ition be as it will. And &s;hould &s;ay he had no cloak for his &s;in, in not doing things of this nature. And that for his not complying with &s;uch a merciful pro|po&s;al of &s;alvation, it &s;hould be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for him. I &s;ay, I believe there are few, but mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of &s;ome difficulty in &s;eeing into the rea&s;onablene&s;s, and ju&s;tice of this. But then, perhaps they may think, there is no way to leave room for &s;uch a di&s;play of divine grace, as we are taught there is, in the &s;alvation of men, without &s;up|po&s;ing &s;omething like this to be in fact the ca&s;e. They may think there can be no nece&s;&s;ity of the grace of the Holy Gho&s;t, on &s;uppo&s;ition &s;inners can comply with the Go&s;pel, whenever they are di&s;po&s;ed to. But any appre|hen&s;ions of this kind, mu&s;t ari&s;e from a very favourable opinion of the goodne&s;s of the &s;inners di&s;po&s;ition. As if he was &s;o willing to u&s;e his talents, and improve the price put into his hands aright, that God has no way &s;ufficiently to di&s;play his grace towards him, but by requiring things of him, which the holie&s;t creature in the univer&s;e, under his circum&s;tances, could not perform. If men are ill-di&s;po&s;ed, they &s;o far &s;tand in need of grace to enable them to do, that which without any &s;uch divine help they would find no difficulty in, if they were well di&s;po&s;ed. And is it not ea&s;y to &s;ee, that it will require as much power, and more grace, to change a &s;inners heart, than to alter a man's head, or enlarge any of his natural faculties?</P>
<P>THE &s;ot, who has lived in a cour&s;e of intemperance from twenty to three &s;core, is &s;till under no inability to reform,
<PB N="46" REF="011467_0045_0F832F5BBB2DF6A0">
but only what ari&s;es from his own appetite and inclinati|on. He might &s;till refu&s;e the gla&s;s, and become a &s;ober man, without any body's advice or help, if his own will was not wanting. But yet no one would think it a le&s;s unpromi&s;ing undertaking, to go about to reclaim &s;uch a per&s;on, than to cure one of a bodily infirmity in which the patient's will had no hand, and which he could not get rid of him&s;elf, let him be never &s;o heartily, and &s;tea|dily, and &s;trongly de&s;irous of it. Suppo&s;e &s;uch a one, that had had all motives, fetched from this world and the world to come, repeatedly urged upon him, in the ten|dere&s;t and mo&s;t forcible manner by all his friends; but without the lea&s;t effect. Should one at la&s;t, find means to per&s;uade him into a thorough and la&s;ting reformation; would he not be thought to do as great a thing, as he that &s;hould cure one of a natural infirmity that had long baffled the &s;kill of all the phy&s;icians?</P>
<P>MORAL &s;ickne&s;s may be as hard to cure, and require as powerful means, and as able a phy&s;ician, as natural &s;ickne&s;s. And if a man is dead in the moral &s;en&s;e; that is, has lo&s;t all principles of true virtue intirely, he is as ab&s;olutely beyond the reach of all means, as to their bringing of him to life again, as one that is dead in the na|tural &s;en&s;e. Moral means, can only work upon &s;uch moral principles, as they find to work upon. They cannot produce a <HI>new nature, new principles</HI> of action, any more than natural means can make new life for them&s;elves to work upon, in a dead carca&s;e. Cultivation and manur|ing may make a bad tree grow, and bear fruit, after it's kind. But can never make a thorn bear figs, or a bram|ble-bu&s;h, grapes. Let what means will be u&s;ed, &s;o long as the tree is evil, the fruit will be &s;o likewi&s;e. If man|kind have lo&s;t the moral image of God intirely, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that nothing &s;hort of a new creation, can re&s;tore it to them. If they are <HI>dead</HI> in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, the quickening them, mu&s;t be an in&s;tance of the working of God's mighty power, in a &s;upernatural manner, like
<PB N="37" REF="011467_0046_0F832F5C6F70D620">
that of rai&s;ing Chri&s;t from the dead. And without a work of this kind, whatever means are u&s;ed with them, they will never have the lea&s;t &s;piritual life, or real holi|ne&s;s. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Ob. Regeneraion is frequently repre&s;ented in &s;cripture, as being effected by means. Men are &s;aid to be born again by the word of God. 1 Pet. i. 23. To be begotten by the word of truth. James i. 18. And Paul &s;ays to the Corinthians, "In Chri&s;t Je&s;us I have begotten you through the go&s;pel." But how is this to be reconciled with making the quickening of &s;inners, properly a &s;upernatural work?</P>
<P>An&s;. Almo&s;t all the &s;upernatural works, recorded in the &s;criptures, are repre&s;ented as wrought by means, as much as regeneration is. The red-&s;ea was divided by Mo&s;es's rod; and the river Jordan by Elijah's mantle. It was by &s;miting the flinty rock, in the wilderne&s;s, that the waters were made to flow out of it like a river. Mo&s;es brought forth this water, as much as Paul regenerated the Corinthians. It was by throwing a &s;tick into the river, that the young prophet's ax was made to &s;wim; and by wa&s;hing &s;even times in Jordan, that Naaman was heal|ed of his lepro&s;y. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> was by prophe&s;ying over a valley of dry bones, as repre&s;ented in the vi&s;ion of Ezekiel, and calling to the four winds to breath upon them, that they were converted into a living army. It was with clay made of dirt and &s;pittle, that our Saviour opened the eyes of one that was born blind. And by calling with a loud voice, that Lazarus was made to hear, and come out of his grave, after he had been dead four days.</P>
<P>Now to &s;uppo&s;e that regeneration is effected by means, as much as the&s;e things were, is not incon&s;i&s;tent with its being properly a &s;upernatural work. But that it is effected by the <HI>power</HI> of means, is what the &s;criptures are far from leading us to conceive. It would be thought very remarkable, if any one &s;hould undertake to explain the connection, betwixt the means u&s;ed and the effects wrought, in tho&s;e in&s;tances now mentioned, in as natural and intelligable a manner as &s;ome have attempted to do, betwixt light in the under&s;tanding, and the pro|ductions of grace in the heart of a totally depraved &s;inner. But yet, I apprehend, any of tho&s;e things, may be as rationally accounted for, from the known laws of nature, as regeneration can; and that the plain ac|count of &s;cripture, as much obliges us to think, the former were ef|fected by the power, or natural tendency, or proper cau&s;ality of means, as that the latter is.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>AND now, does not the admiting &s;uch a total moral depravity, &s;uppo&s;e room and nece&s;&s;ity enough, for the grace of the Holy Gho&s;t in the &s;alvation of men, without &s;uppo&s;ing any deficiency in their natural faculties?</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="011467_0047_0F832F5D18184A08">BUT let us compare the two hypothe&s;es, that of a na|tural inability, and the contrary one which I have now been endeavouring to prove, and we may ea&s;ily &s;ee which gives the highe&s;t conception of the grace of God. Tho&s;e who conceive &s;inners labour under a natural incapacity to come to Chri&s;t, place the defect in the under&s;tanding. They &s;uppo&s;e that ignorance and mi&s;-apprehen&s;ion, is the primary cau&s;e of all our enmity and oppo&s;ition to God. And con&s;equently, that as &s;oon as the under&s;tand|ing comes to be rectified and rightly informed, we of cour&s;e become reconciled in heart to the ways of God; and plea&s;ed with the character and mediation of Chri&s;t. This &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e we always had been conformed to God's real character, in the temper of our minds; and that all we had been quarrelling with, and enemies to, was only a fal&s;e idea of God; or &s;uch a character as no one <HI>ought</HI> to love. As if a very righteous man, &s;hould be prejudiced again&s;t &amp; greatly engaged in oppo&s;ing another, that was really as righteous and good a man as him&s;elf. But he had been mi&s;-informed about him, and conceiv'd him to be quite a different man, from what he really was. Now as &s;oon as his under&s;tanding comes to be tru|ly enlightened, or his mi&s;takes are removed, and he gets a thorough acquaintance, the good man loves the good man, of cour&s;e, without any change of character in ei|ther. But, &s;hall we view the enmity of the carnal mind again&s;t God in this light, in order to have the mo&s;t ex|alted idea of the divine grace, in the &s;alvation of &s;uch a carnal per&s;on? Shall we &s;uppo&s;e that the rea&s;on, and the only rea&s;on, why he is not, neither indeed can be, &s;ubject to the law of God, is becau&s;e he does not, neither indeed can under&s;tand it? Or becau&s;e, through the weakne&s;s of his natural powers, he under&s;tands it &s;o, as it would be wicked to obey it, and no truly virtuous and upright mind, could be &s;ubject to it, or &s;uited with it, in <HI>his &s;en&s;e</HI> of it?&mdash;In that ca&s;e, all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be done by the divine &s;pirit, is, to inform us rightly concerning the
<PB N="49" REF="011467_0048_0F832F5DEA6F6358">
holy nature and ways of God; and let us know that all our hatred of him, is owing to a <HI>mere mi&s;under&s;tanding</HI>; and that he is really ju&s;t &s;uch a being, as we all natural|ly love; even altogether &s;uch an one as our&s;elves. Can there be a nece&s;&s;ity of any thing &s;upernatural, in bringing a &s;inner "out of darkne&s;s into God's marve|lous light," if this is all that is implied in it?&mdash;Yes, it will be &s;aid, a &s;upernatural work upon the <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> is &s;till nece&s;&s;ary. Though light alone, will produce all the change of heart that is wanted; yet not <HI>objective</HI> light merely, but what may perhaps be called <HI>&s;ubjective</HI> light. That is, the under&s;tanding it&s;elf, mu&s;t be &s;trength|ened, or enlarged, or brightened, or &s;ome how made better; otherways the external light, however clear, will &s;hine in darkne&s;s, and cannot be comprehended.</P>
<P>Now if this is the &s;upernatural work of the &s;pirit, which per&s;ons are the &s;ubjects of when they are born a|gain, it is of the &s;ame nature, as if a natural fool, &s;hould, by a miracle, have rea&s;on given him. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is apprehended, this repre&s;entation of the matter, will be tho't no fair, if not quite ridiculous. Men don't mean to be made <HI>natural</HI> fools of, neither. The weakne&s;s, and blindne&s;s, and want of abilities &s;o much complain'd of, is nothing of this kind. They would be thought to have as much wit, as much rea&s;on, and good &s;en&s;e, as the be&s;t, notwith|&s;tanding all their darkne&s;s of under&s;tanding. Nay, they may exceed e|ven a Locke, or a Sir I&s;aac Newton in clearne&s;s and &s;trength of mind, and yet have &s;uch weak intellects, as to be incapable of under&s;tanding truly, the plaine&s;t principles of the oracles of God. Thus the reputati|on of the head, and the heart, are equally taken care of; while the poor <HI>defect,</HI> which mu&s;t bear the blame of all the &s;in in the world, is crouded into a corner of the &s;oul, which no &s;oul has, and therefore, which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> cares how much is &s;aid again&s;t.</NOTE> But is this the way to advance the grace of God mo&s;t, in our &s;alvation?

<P>LET any one only think how he would addre&s;s him|&s;elf to God, with a view to magnify the riches of his grace in &s;aving him. Would he think that le&s;&s;ening his former natural abilities as much as po&s;&s;ible, was the way to do this mo&s;t effectually? Would he acknowledge that man by the fall had lo&s;t his rational powers, and was become no wi&s;er than the bea&s;ts of the field, and of no more under&s;tanding than the fouls of heaven; and therefore, that he had been utterly incapable of know|ing what a kind of being God was, or what his law re|quired, or getting any ju&s;t notions concerning Chri&s;t and the way of &s;alvation? That no one who&s;e mental powers were &s;o weak, or &s;o much di&s;ordered, as his had always been, could ever po&s;&s;ibly get a true under&s;tand|ing of any of tho&s;e things?

Is this, I &s;ay, the ac|knowledgment one would make, with a view to glorify &s;overeign grace, in bringing him out of darkne&s;s into marvelous light?&mdash;Or would he not rather acknowledge the goodne&s;s of God, in giving him rational powers in his fir&s;t formation, and &s;o rendering him capable of act|ing a higher and happier part than the mere &s;en&s;itive creation; capable of &s;erving and enjoying God as a ra|tional creature? Would he not acknowledge that, tho' God might mo&s;t ju&s;tly have deprived him of all the pe|culiar dignities and advantages of the rational nature, for his own and not merely for Adam's abu&s;e of them, yet he had not done it? That he had not been denied the u&s;e of rea&s;on, or the opportunity and means of know|ing God as many had been? But that under all the&s;e

advantages to know God, he had not glorified him as God, nor been thankful. That he had &s;hut his eyes again&s;t the cleare&s;t light, turned a deaf ear to the mo&s;t gracious calls, and hated the be&s;t of Beings; hated him, not for what he is not, but for what he is; for his righteou&s;ne&s;s, for his holine&s;s; for tho&s;e very things for which angels and &s;aints, &s;o much admire and love him. And that the more he knew of God and Chri&s;t, the more he hated them; and &s;hould forever have done &s;o, had not divine grace mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hingly interpo&s;ed in favour of &s;o vile a wretch, and changed his nature, given him quite another &s;pirit.</P>
<P>IT is &s;trange if any <HI>&s;hould</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly think, that di&s;play|ing abroad their natural weakne&s;&s;es and infirmities, and alledging the&s;e as the only cau&s;es why they have not known or done, better than they have, is the way to humble them&s;elves mo&s;t before God, and to do the mo&s;t honor to his grace in their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>THOSE who hold to natural inability, and &s;uppo&s;e all that &s;inners want, is to have their under&s;tandings rectifi|ed, thereby virtually and really, tho' I &s;uppo&s;e not de|&s;ignedly, deny moral depravity altogether.

<P N="1">1. FROM what has been &s;aid I think it follows, that there is no foundation for conceiving of &s;inners as be|ing to blame and inexcu&s;able, in part of their neglect of the great &s;alvation, and not in the whole of it; or that they may rea&s;onably be exhorted, to do part of what is implied in coming to Chri&s;t, but not the whole. Some &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e that unregenerate &s;inners are not to blame for not doing things which imply real holine&s;s, and can't be done without, as repenting truly of their &s;ins, believing in Chri&s;t, loving God, &amp;c. But that for not doing other things, which may be done with|out any holine&s;s at heart, as reforming externally, pray|ing, &amp;c. they are altogether inexcu&s;able. But is not this evidently a di&s;tinction without any ju&s;t foundation? Either the natural abilities of men mu&s;t be the mea|&s;ure of their duty, and all they come &s;hort of this is &s;in; or el&s;e their duty is to be mea&s;ured by their moral ability, and they are to blame only &s;o far as they fall &s;hort of doing, what they have a heart to do. Now if we are under obligation to do well, to the utmo&s;t of our <HI>natural</HI> power, and no abatement of duty ought to be made, on account of an evil heart, or the want of a good one; then &s;inners are to blame and altogether in|excu&s;able, in not for&s;aking &s;in heartily, as well as ex|ternally;
<PB N="53" REF="011467_0052_0F832F60D842C8F0">
in not believing in Chri&s;t, loving God and be|ing cordially obedient to his will. For none of the&s;e things are impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uch as are well di&s;po&s;ed. But if <HI>moral</HI> power is the mea&s;ure of duty, if want of a di&s;po&s;ition to do otherways than a man does, renders him excu&s;able and not to blame; then <HI>all</HI> are excu&s;able, <HI>none</HI> are to blame. The thoughtle&s;s and &s;ecure, the prayerle&s;s and profane, the mo&s;t profligate and aban|doned, are as excu&s;able, as little to blame as any others. For the inclinations of the wor&s;t of men, it may, with|out any great &s;tretch of charity, be &s;uppo&s;ed, are as bad as their actions are. They are none of them any more wicked than they are di&s;po&s;ed to be. Nor have any of them a moral power to be any better. The di&s;&s;olute and immoral might reform, it is true, if they were in|clined to. The carele&s;s &s;inner might become &s;erious and thoughtful about his &s;alvation, might read and hear, meditate and pray, if he was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed. But it is as true, that &s;inners might come to the &s;aving know|ledge of the way of life, might repent and believe the go&s;pel, were they &s;o di&s;po&s;ed. Nothing but a heart is wanting in one ea&s;e any more than in the other: And that is wanting in both ca&s;es.
<Q>The vile per&s;on <HI>will &s;peak</HI> villany, and his heart <HI>will</HI> work iniquity, to practice hypocri&s;y, to utter error, &amp;c.</Q>
We are told that "the heart of the &s;ons of men is full of evil." And what they will do, if left to them&s;elves, we are al&s;o told. See Rom. i. 27&mdash;31.
<Q>God gave them over to a reprobate mind;</Q>
that is, left them to act their own minds without re&s;traint. And what was the con&s;e|quence?
<Q>They were filled with all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, fornication, wickedne&s;s, covetou&s;ne&s;s, maliciou&s;ne&s;s, full of envy, murder, &amp;c.</Q>
The &s;candalous &s;inner will not become externally reformed, without re&s;training grace; nor will the &s;ecure &s;inner &s;eek and pray, and u&s;e the means of grace, unle&s;s he is awakened; any more than a man will come to Chri&s;t, without the

drawing of the father. The drunkard has not a moral power, that is, a &s;ufficient inclination, to for&s;ake his cups, while he does not for&s;ake them; nor the lewd per&s;on to for&s;ake his lewd practices; nor the murder|er to hold back his hand from &s;hedding of blood, any more than the natural man has to embrace the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>THERE is therefore no propriety in exhorting the un|regenerate, to do only &s;uch things as are con&s;i&s;tent with an intirely depraved and wicked heart, as if nothing further could be expected of them at pre&s;ent, any more than there would be in exhorting the mo&s;t abandon'd of mankind, to do only what is con&s;i&s;tent with their di&s;|po&s;ition and cour&s;e of life, becau&s;e nothing better can be expected of them, till they are better di&s;po&s;ed, or are under greater re&s;traints.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, there is no &s;uch compounding with the natural man, for what he can do, without a heart to do any thing that is good, to be met with any where in the &s;acred &s;criptures. God's <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> demand upon every one of us is, "give me thy heart." He does not &s;ay, give me thy external obedience only, make a decent &s;hew of &s;eeking and &s;erving me, and it &s;hall &s;uffice for the pre|&s;ent; for as for thy heart, I know,
<Q>there is no hope, it hath loved &s;trangers, and after them it <HI>will</HI> go.</Q>
The law requires truth <HI>in the inward parts</HI>; yea it de|mands a perfect heart.
<Q>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy &s;trength; and thy neighbor as thy &s;elf.</Q>
Not, thou &s;halt &s;eek and pray for this temper, towards God and man, but thou &s;halt <HI>have</HI> it.&mdash;The New-Te&s;tament preachers of &s;alvation through Chri&s;t, &s;ay,
<Q>repent and believe the go&s;pel. Repent and be converted that your &s;ins may be blotted out.</Q>
The &s;um of their preaching, "both to the Jews, and al&s;o to the Greeks," was,
<Q>repentance toward God, and
<PB N="55" REF="011467_0054_0F832F6258F10668">
faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q>
Not te&s;ti|fying, "as the manner of &s;ome is," that if &s;inners will do what they can, (meaning what their wicked hearts will let them do, what the carnal mind which is enmity a|gain&s;t God, may con&s;ent to,) they will not be left to pe|ri&s;h; but God will undoubtedly have pity on them, and afford them further help.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY, if the divine law is ju&s;t, no man can ju&s;tly excu&s;e him&s;elf, or be excu&s;ed, &s;hort of a perfect heart, and a perfect life. And if the go&s;pel is true, there is no &s;afety for any &s;inner, no ground of dependence that God will have mercy on him, or ever &s;hew him any fa|vour, &s;hort of Chri&s;t, &amp; an actual intere&s;t in him by faith.
<Q>He that believeth not, is condemned already, becau&s;e he hath not believed in the name of the only begot|ten Son of God. He that believeth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. He that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</Q></P>
<P>'Tis extremely obvious, that the &s;criptures every where treat the impenitent and the unbeliever, with as little ceremony as any &s;inners what&s;oever. And it is exceeding evident, I think, from what has now been &s;aid, that rea&s;on affords no plea in their favour, but what will equally excu&s;e any &s;inner in the world, in being as he is, &amp; in doing as he does. If the want of a good heart, is a good plea, every &s;inner, and every imperfect &s;aint, may avail him&s;elf of it to his compleat ju&s;tification. Tho&s;e who are &s;anctified but in part, cannot be blamed for being but imperfectly holy. Tho&s;e who have no true holine&s;s at all, cannot be required to have any, or be blam'd if they act as well as they can without it. And, by the &s;ame rule, not &s;o much as an external re|formation, can be required of tho&s;e who have no mind to reform. Nothing can be &s;aid to the purpo&s;e of excu&s;|ing &s;inners on account of the badne&s;s of their hearts, unle&s;s we would undertake to maintain this general principle, that the duty of every one, mu&s;t be only ju&s;t
<PB N="56" REF="011467_0055_0F832F63210E6700">
according to every one's di&s;po&s;ition. But if this prin|ciple is true, every one mu&s;t ea&s;ily &s;ee, there can never be any &s;uch thing as neglect of duty, or de&s;ert of pu|ni&s;hment, or need of grace, in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. FROM what has been &s;aid it may appear, that there is no force in that common plea in the mouths of &s;in|ners, namely, That they did not bring their depravity upon them&s;elves, but were born with it. If their hearts are altogether &s;inful, they did'nt 'make them &s;o, nor is it any of their fault; they have only &s;uch hearts as were given them, without their choice or con&s;ent.&mdash;Now in arguing thus, they evidently view a wicked heart, in no other light than as a mere weakne&s;s, which a man would not choo&s;e, but it is what he cannot help. They con&s;ider it as a thing not at all faulty in its <HI>own nature</HI>; &s;o that if they are to blame about it, it mu&s;t be for &s;omething previous to it, and quite of another nature. Concerning innocent natural infirmities, we ju&s;tly judge in the above manner. Thus if a man is &s;ick, we don't blame him for it; we know bodily &s;ickne&s;s is no moral evil. But if we are told the man brought his &s;ickne&s;s upon him&s;elf, by intemperance, or &s;ome bad conduct, then we fault and condemn him; that was a moral evil, though this is not&middot;&mdash;Now tho&s;e who make the a|bove plea, rea&s;on ju&s;t in this manner about <HI>&s;in it&s;elf.</HI> As if it was not &s;in, merely to <HI>be a &s;inner</HI>; or to commit &s;in when one has an inclination to. But that the <HI>bringing a &s;inful di&s;po&s;ition upon our&s;elves,</HI> had we done this, would indeed have been a very wicked thing.</P>
<P>HENCE it &s;eems to many, as if the poor &s;inful chil|dren of men, were only as it were under a fit of &s;ick|ne&s;s, which Adam brought on him&s;elf and them, by do|ing an evil deed which he might ea&s;ily enough have a|voided, in as much as he was perfectly holy; but that we his mi&s;erable offspring, being by nature &s;inners, are under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning, and therefore cannot be to blame for it. It &s;eems as if <HI>Adam</HI> was in reality the
<PB N="57" REF="011467_0056_0F832F63EBC640C8">
only &s;inner, and his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;in, the only &s;in of the human kind; becau&s;e that &s;in was committed while man had, not an imaginary, but a real, a moral as well as natural power, to ab&s;tain from all &s;in. That is; the fir&s;t &s;in did not ari&s;e from, or con&s;i&s;t in, any defect in the will; and herein con&s;i&s;ts the &s;infulne&s;s of it. If Adam did'nt &s;in before he had any inclination to, and while he was &s;trong|ly enough inclin'd to the contrary, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, he had ju&s;t the &s;ame excu&s;e for his fir&s;t &s;in, as we have for any of ours. Let his fir&s;t &s;in be placed where it will, whether in actually eating the forbidden fruit; or in hear|kening to any temptations to do it; or in being off his watch; or in whatever any one plea&s;es, &s;till we mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e it committed while his heart was perfectly good, el&s;e he did'nt &s;in without this boa&s;ted excu&s;e of other &s;inners, want of a moral power to do otherways. Thus by forgetting that &s;in is in it&s;elf &s;inful, we are led to look for &s;ome|thing el&s;e that is &s;o, not in &s;inners, but in perfectly in|nocent beings! We are led to &s;uppo&s;e, creatures are capable of being to blame, no longer, or further, than they are holy! We conceive Adam to blame, becau&s;e of the uprightne&s;s of his heart; and our&s;elves blamele&s;s, becau&s;e our hearts are &s;o wicked! For in this way, we certainly bring nothing but perfect holine&s;s into the ac|count, as an aggravation of Adam's &s;in, beyond tho&s;e of his po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THE very fir&s;t idea we can have of &s;in, is a depraved and wicked heart. And if this is not a blameable thing <HI>in it&s;elf,</HI> there is no danger of finding any thing that is. Could we clearly confound all di&s;tinction betwixt natu|ral and moral evil, and &s;o betwixt natural and moral in|ability, as things <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> different, from our own con|&s;ciences, we &s;hould be &s;ecure enough. And in matters of religion, men generally do confound the&s;e things &s;o far as to feel very ea&s;y, and very much as if there <HI>was no &s;in.</HI> But let a neighbour be very unkind and injurious to
<PB N="58" REF="011467_0057_0F832F64CCDBDAD8">
them, and they begin to &s;ee a difference. This does not look to them, ju&s;t as if he was only lame, and unable to go out of their way. Nor do they lay the blame upon Adam, but upon the malicious and unrighteous wretch him&s;elf. Nor does their being told, it is his <HI>very nature</HI> to be &s;o, make them think much the better of him.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF the di&s;tinction now in&s;i&s;ted on was well under|&s;tood, and clearly kept in view, it would appear, in like manner, that a &s;inner's not being able to change his own heart, is really nothing in his favour. Here, &s;ome may be ready to think, is the grand difficulty after all. What they wanted to know, was, not whether &s;inners <HI>would</HI> be able to comply with the go&s;pel, or to obey the law, if their hearts were good; but whether it is in their power to have &s;uch an heart in them. For what does it &s;ignify what a man could do, if he had that which he has not, and can by no means obtain?&mdash;Sin|ners don't &s;ee how it is their own fault, that they have &s;uch bad hearts, and do nothing from gracious princi|ples, provided it is not in their own power to alter them|&s;elves in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>NOW if a wicked heart was not a <HI>moral evil,</HI> but a thing of the &s;ame nature as a weak head, a bad memo|ry, or an infirm con&s;titution, this would be the ca&s;e. A man is not to blame for having the&s;e, provided he can|not help it. But if a wicked heart is a thing of a crimi|nal nature, a thing quite different from any &s;uch natural weakne&s;&s;es, then there is no force in the above rea&s;oning. If to have a heart to hate and oppo&s;e, God and our neighbour, in&s;tead of loving them as we are required, is a moral evil; as certainly it is, and the &s;um of <HI>all</HI> mo|ral evil; then to &s;ay a man can't alter in this re&s;pect, is only to &s;ay he can't help being a mo&s;t vile and inexcu|&s;able wretch. To be unalterably in love with &s;in, does not &s;urely render one the le&s;s <HI>&s;inful,</HI> but the more &s;o. Surely the wickeder a man's heart is, the more faulty and to blame he is.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="011467_0058_0F832F655BC6EA88">BUT the fallacy, whereby &s;inners elude their con&s;ci|ences in this matter, lies in a &s;ecret &s;uppo&s;ition that they could not change their hearts, nor would they be chan|ged, though they &s;hould never &s;o <HI>&s;incerely,</HI> and <HI>heartily,</HI> and <HI>uprightly try</HI> to do it; which would indeed be a very hard ca&s;e. If a &s;inner hone&s;tly, and from a truly virtuous di&s;po&s;ition, tried, to the utmo&s;t of his natural power, to alter his entirely wicked di&s;po&s;ition, but it would'nt alter; he was as bad as ever after all; it would &s;eem indeed, that he was in a very pitiable &s;ituation, but not very faulty. Yea, it would be difficult to &s;ee wherein he was <HI>at all</HI> to blame. And that &s;omething like this, is the real view which multitudes have of the matter, is very evident.</P>
<P>LET us put the ca&s;e (as people would have it) that &s;inners were, in all re&s;pects, able to change their own hearts. Only it mu&s;t take &s;ome time, a <HI>month</HI> &s;uppo&s;e; and they mu&s;t apply them&s;elves very diligently, very faithfully to the work, all that while, in order to ac|compli&s;h it. There is a &s;inner, however, that neglects his opportunity, and &s;pends the whole month in &s;in, without ever u&s;ing any means, or making the lea&s;t at|tempt to get a good heart. Is he not to blame now for this? Mo&s;t certainly he is. But why &s;o? Why &s;o!&mdash; Does not every one &s;ee that &s;uch carele&s;ne&s;s in a ca&s;e like this, &s;uch indifference about becoming good, when it was entirely in one's power, mu&s;t be inexcu&s;able to the la&s;t degree? To continue thus in &s;in, when there was no manner of nece&s;&s;ity of it; &s;urely this can never be ju&s;tified.&mdash;But another &s;inner was much better di&s;|pos'd. He &s;eiz'd the favourable opportunity, and ap|plied him&s;elf with the greate&s;t imaginable diligence; and at the month's end, actually became a good man. Now was <HI>he</HI> to blame, during this time that he was thus faithfully labouring, and doing all in his power to be|come good? By no means. But why not? He had a bad heart. Yes, but he did as well as ever he could, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="60" REF="011467_0059_0F832F66201EABE8">
that. No man could have done better, under his circum&s;tances. And he was actually of a wicked <HI>di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> no longer, than till he could po&s;&s;ibly be otherways.</P>
<P>THUS people would be apt to judge in &s;uch ca&s;es. And this &s;hews what notions men have of inability with reference to the &s;inner's changing his heart; and what the rea&s;on is they &s;ay the di&s;tinction of natural and mo|ral inability &s;ignifies nothing. For by whatever <HI>name</HI> it is called, they will conceive of it as being of the &s;ame <HI>nature.</HI> If they own it lies in the wicked di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;inner altogether, yet they don't conceive it lies in the di&s;po&s;ition he <HI>acts from,</HI> but in a great, ugly di&s;po&s;i|tion he is <HI>acting again&s;t,</HI> but is unable to overcome. They &s;uppo&s;e the inability he labours under is &s;uch, that he may be well di&s;pos'd, and do well; yea, that he may be di&s;pos'd to do the whole duty of one under his circum&s;tances, and actually do it, and yet not be able to help being of an entirely depraved and wicked di&s;po&s;ition. Nor could they find the lea&s;t &s;hadow of an excu&s;e for him, did they not view his ca&s;e in this ab&s;urd light;&mdash;did they not con&s;ider him as faithfully exerting him&s;elf, with an hone&s;t and good intention, endeavour|ing to <HI>become good,</HI> but all in vain. Or at lea&s;t, did they not &s;uppo&s;e him willing enough to exert him&s;elf in this manner, only he knows it will &s;ignify nothing. In this way it is that a perver&s;e and &s;tubborn will, a wicked and unwilling mind, comes to be thought as innocent a thing, and as good an excu&s;e, as any in the world. It is view'd as a mere weakne&s;s; a thing not incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>trying</HI> to be holy, but incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>being</HI> &s;o, let one try never &s;o heartily. Which is the proper noti|on of natural inability. And to maintain this notion, they have a double meaning to every word, by which "the abominable thing" which men are to blame for, can po&s;&s;ibly be expre&s;&s;ed. <HI>Sins</HI> they di&s;tingui&s;h into vo|luntary, and involuntary, nece&s;&s;ary and unnece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="61" REF="011467_0060_0F832F66E2BC3258">
faulty and faultle&s;s ones. They al&s;o make two &s;orts of <HI>wicked hearts.</HI> One that is really wicked, and for which men are to blame; another that is totally wicked, but not really &s;o at all, and which is no man's own fault. Could they only be made &s;en&s;ible that their &s;ins, and their wicked hearts, were of the bad <HI>kind,</HI> their mouths would be &s;topped. But to fa&s;ten a conviction of this upon them, is one of the mo&s;t difficult things in the world. They will affix &s;uch ideas to every word that can be made u&s;e of to expre&s;s an evil di&s;po&s;ition of mind, as to make an innocent thing of it;&mdash;a kind of dead weight, which, either they make them&s;elves as ea&s;y as they can under, knowing they mu&s;t bear it; or el&s;e are &s;triving with all their might to &s;hake off, but can't. The &s;eeking &s;inner, at lea&s;t, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have as &s;incere an inclination to become truly good, and to have a heart to do his duty, as a &s;ick man has to be well. His <HI>wi&s;h|es,</HI> his <HI>de&s;ires,</HI> and <HI>endeavours</HI> are all very good. All he wants is to be directed how, or to have &s;trength enough to be able, to get a good heart. Thus
<Q>deceitful a|bove all things,</Q>
is the heart of a &s;inner! Thus art|ful in hiding it&s;elf, and keeping out of &s;ight, and laying all blame &s;omewhere el&s;e! The <HI>heart,</HI> the <HI>di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> the <HI>inclination,</HI> the <HI>will,</HI> are readily allow'd to be altoge|ther wrong and &s;inful, while yet what is properly meant by all tho&s;e words, is &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed to be good enough; and hence the &s;inner can't &s;ee how he is to blame. Yea the very thing for which alone any one <HI>can</HI> be to blame, is look'd upon as his &s;ufficient excu&s;e and ju&s;tification. Thus "a deceived heart hath turned him a&s;ide, that he cannot deliver his &s;oul, nor &s;ay, Is there not a lie in my right hand?"</P>
<P N="4">4. WE may hence learn, what alone is &s;ufficient to convince a man that his utter impotence does not le&s;&s;en his obligation in any mea&s;ure, or afford him the lea&s;t cloak for his &s;ins. It is only his being made &s;en&s;ible what his impotence really is, and wherein it con&s;i&s;ts.

That he does not &s;o much as <HI>intend</HI> to do his duty, as duty, and never did. That he does not <HI>mean well,</HI> in any thing he does.

They &s;hould lie o|pen to conviction, and be willing to know the truth, and to embrace it when di&s;cover'd.

<P N="6">6. According to what has been &s;aid, there can be no rea&s;onable objection again&s;t God's giving no encourage|ments of &s;alvation, on lower terms than an actual com|pliance with the go&s;pel. Many are ready to &s;ay, if there are no promi&s;es (or encouragements amounting to the &s;ame thing) on any terms &s;hort of &s;aving faith, God is not in earne&s;t in his propo&s;als to &s;inners, and does not treat them well, but rather trifles with and mocks them in their mi&s;ery; for he knows that no unregenerate &s;in|ner can come up to &s;uch terms, any more than he can make a world. But according to what has been &s;aid, if &s;inners were but in <HI>earne&s;t them&s;elves</HI> about their &s;alvati|on; if they were di&s;pot'd to <HI>treat God well,</HI> and not to <HI>mock</HI> and <HI>trifle with him,</HI> there would be no difficulty in the ca&s;e. There <HI>were natural impo&s;&s;ibilities</HI> in the way of our obtaining &s;alvation. But <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has removed every thing of <HI>this kind</HI> out of the way. He has paid the dreadful debt of &s;uffering which we could never pay;
<PB N="65" REF="011467_0064_0F832F69D714B4E8">
and has wrought out an all-perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s for out ju&s;tification, which mere creatures, having once tran&s;|gre&s;s'd, could never do. And now he &s;ays,
<Q>A&s;k, and it &s;hall be given you: Seek, and ye &s;hall find: Knock, and it &s;hall be opened unto you. For every one that a&s;keth, receiveth; and he that &s;eeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it &s;hall be open|ed.</Q>
Pa&s;t &s;ins are no bar in the way; for there is "a fountain &s;et open," not only
<Q>for Judah and Je|ru&s;alem,</Q>
but for all the world
<Q>to wa&s;h in, from &s;in and from uncleanne&s;s.</Q>
The greate&s;t unworthi|ne&s;s is no objection; for the invitation is,
<Q>Ho, every one that thir&s;teth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come buy and eat, yea, come, buy wine and milk, without money, and without price. <HI>Who&s;oever will,</HI> let him come, and take the water of life freely.</Q>
Sinners, you have really as fair an opportunity for life, according to the go&s;pel, as probationers can po&s;&s;ibly have; as full a price in your hands, as your hearts can po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire. There is nothing on earth; there is nothing in all the de|crees of heaven; there is nothing in all the malice and power of hell, that can hinder your &s;alvation, if you don't hinder it your&s;elves. Nor need you be di&s;couraged by rea&s;on of any bad di&s;po&s;ition brought upon you by Adam, which you are heartily &s;orry for, and would be glad to git rid of, but can't. For the <HI>Second Adam</HI> is able to help you in this, as well as other re&s;pects; and will do it in a moment, if you in the lea&s;t degree really de&s;ire it. The very thing he came for was to &s;ave from &s;in, the power, as well as the guilt of it; and to &s;ave whoever wants to be thus &s;aved. This was the very rea&s;on his name was called <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> Nor need you imagine, that you mu&s;t lay out all your own &s;trength fir&s;t, and do all that can rea&s;onably be required of one under your circum&s;tances; and then may have ju&s;t an <HI>encouragement</HI> of being &s;aved of <HI>grace</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="011467_0065_0F832F6A9E31C068">
after a life of &s;uch perfection. This is the mo&s;t re|proachful idea of the God of all grace, that you can po&s;&s;ibly entertain. No. If you do &s;o well that it would be hard for God to refu&s;e you &s;alvation, he will &s;ave you mo&s;t righteou&s;ly, and never de&s;ire you &s;hould <HI>pretend</HI> to think there is any grace in it. But he will receive you <HI>graciou&s;ly,</HI> and love you <HI>freely,</HI> if you de&s;ire it, though you have not done &s;o very well. He means to exerci&s;e as much grace, as he would have the honor of, and not to be eternally prai&s;ed for what is not his real due. He is willing to &s;ave you in as gracious a manner as ever you thought of, or can wi&s;h for. Only weigh the matter, and &s;ay whether you choo&s;e to be &s;aved. En|ter into the nature of go&s;pel-&s;alvation; attend to the character and laws of Chri&s;t. And then &s;ay, whether you will have <HI>him</HI> and be <HI>his</HI>; whether you are willing, and would really chu&s;e to exchange the &s;ervitude of &s;atan, for that liberty wherewith Chri&s;t makes his fol|lowers free; or whether you mu&s;t plainly &s;ay, you love your old ma&s;ter and your lu&s;ts, and chu&s;e rather, to have your ear bored, and be a &s;ervant forever. But, however,
<Q>be &s;ure of this, that the kingdom of God is come high unto you;</Q>
and if you freely refu&s;e to have any part or lot in it, be a&s;&s;ured, that when the wicked are turned into hell, with all the nations that forget God, it will be more tolerable for <HI>Sodom</HI> than for you. But I mu&s;t not enlarge further, by way of particular inference.</P>
<P>ON the whole; I am not able to conceive how any one who enters into the matter, can que&s;tion the propri|ety of making the di&s;tinction in&s;i&s;ted on in the&s;e di&s;|cour&s;es; or with what appearance of rea&s;on, any can pretend it is a u&s;ele&s;s di&s;tinction. As to the importance of it; it may ea&s;ily be ob&s;erved, in how many in&s;tan|ces, upon the mo&s;t leading points, and in the mo&s;t ma|terial re&s;pects, by the help of this di&s;tinction, common &s;en&s;e will cro&s;s the common notions of &s;inners, exactly
<PB N="67" REF="011467_0066_0F832F6B60BD4578">
where the bible cro&s;&s;es them.&mdash;It &s;ets rea&s;on, and &s;crip|ture, divine ju&s;tice, and divine grace, in a quite con|&s;i&s;tent view; whereas without it, I apprehend they mu&s;t forever appear irreconcilable.&mdash;It leads good men to &s;ee that human infirmities and imperfections, are not &s;uch comfortable extenuations of guilt, as they are &s;ometimes ready to make of them. That all their <HI>moral</HI> infirmity, all their want of <HI>perfect holine&s;s,</HI> is intirely their own fault; and what they ought to be deeply humbled for, and go mourning under all their days &mdash;It &s;hows &s;inners, that their perdition is really al|together of them&s;elves: That all ground of di&s;cour|agement in their ca&s;e, is their own badne&s;s. And not their unworthine&s;s, neither, but merely their <HI>unwilling|ne&s;s</HI> to be made clean. That this indeed makes their ca&s;e de&s;perate, from every other quarter but the unco|venanted grace of God. In <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> or from any <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that man can &s;ay or do,
<Q>there is no hope. No, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> have loved &s;trangers, and after them they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> go.</Q>
And as to changing the hearts of &s;uch, God has re&s;erved it as the &s;overeign prerogative of the throne of his grace, to
<Q>have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and compa&s;&s;ion on whom he will have compa&s;&s;ion.</Q>
&mdash;It admini&s;ters not &s;o much com|fort, indeed, to &s;inners in their impenitence and unbe|lief, as they would be glad to have. But in this awful condition, they have generally comfort enough, and too much in all rea&s;on. To kill their &s;elf-righteous hopes, and let them &s;ee their guilt and danger, their utter helple&s;ne&s;s, and yet entire inexcu&s;ablene&s;s, is the kind|e&s;t thing that can be done for them. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, however, is the grand objection; the grand rea&s;on why it is &s;aid, it does no good, it comes to the &s;ame thing when all is done and &s;aid. The &s;inner is as helple&s;s, and as ab&s;olutely dependent on &s;overeign grace, if his inability lies in his di&s;po&s;ition, as if any thing el&s;e was the matter with him. For a wicked heart will as infallibly &s;hut a man out of heaven, if he is left to it, as any thing in the world could. &mdash;Hence very ingenius writers, even tho' they make the di&s;tinction now in&s;i&s;ted on and by their fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ions one would think &s;aw the difference, will yet &s;uppo&s;e after all, that the terms of &s;alvation mu&s;t be level to the <HI>hearts</HI> of men; or that <HI>&s;omething</HI> mu&s;t be done, whereby &s;inners <HI>may</HI> be &s;aved, notwith&s;tanding their <HI>moral</HI> impotence. That things mu&s;t not be left &s;o, that even
<Q>his own iniquities &s;hall take the wicked him&s;elf, and be &s;hall be <HI>holden</HI> in the cords of his &s;ins.</Q>
&mdash;To &s;ay that if &s;al|vation is offered to all who heartily de&s;ire and chu&s;e it, and &s;o truly a&s;k for it, it is offered on the lowe&s;t terms is therefore treated with contempt; and it is replied, then we may well &s;ay, wo to the &s;inner who&s;e confi|dence in his own &s;incerity fails him. If a man has not this hearty de|&s;ire, and can't create it in him&s;elf he is in a deplorable condition. Ac|cordingly the &s;criptures are ran&s;ack'd for encouragements, if not promi|&s;e, to &s;omething lower than a&s;king for &s;alvation, or being willing to have it. And the totally depraved heart, is carefully &s;ounded, to fin<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> ground for doings that are not <HI>unlawful,</HI> tho' altogether <HI>unholy.</HI> That upon the&s;e better &s;ort of unholy doings, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> one &s;ide, and tho&s;e en|couragements on the other, a bridge may be built over all impo&s;&s;ibili|ties of every kind &s;o that no &s;inner &s;hall be in a deplorable condition, by rea&s;on of his moral depravity.

<P N="1"><PB N="68" REF="011467_0067_0F832F6C21661068">1. WE have &s;een the <HI>bible</HI> is as expre&s;s and full in ma|king the difference &s;uppo&s;ed, as it is in any thing. We have &s;een that all the heart, &s;oul, mind and &s;trength; that is, a perfectly willing and faithful exertion of all our faculties, however enfeebled they are, is all that God requires of us in his perfect law. Nor is there a &s;ingle in&s;tance of a natural impo&s;&s;ibility's being re|quired of any man, in all the &s;acred records. Nor is it once intimated, that natural impo&s;&s;ibilities <HI>might</HI> ju&s;tly be required of us, becau&s;e our natural powers were im|paired by the fall. But, on the other hand, we have &s;een that the mo&s;t ab&s;olute <HI>moral</HI> impo&s;&s;ibilities are re|quired of all men, without the lea&s;t &s;cruple, as if there was no kind of difficulty in them. That a perfect heart and a perfect life, are as much required of men now, as if they were not fallen creatures; and required of the greate&s;t &s;inner, as much as of the be&s;t &s;aint. No pecu|liar provi&s;e's are made, in favour of even the mo&s;t a|bandon'd.' Nor is it once intimated, any where in &s;crip|ture, that the rea&s;on why men may be required to do that which is lawful and right, tho' it is contrary to their
<PB N="69" REF="011467_0068_0F832F6CDA0E1EC8">
inclination, is becau&s;e Adam did that which was unlaw|ful and wrong, contrary to <HI>his</HI> inclination. Or that all the rea&s;on why a wicked heart, is not intirely innocent, and a good excu&s;e, is becau&s;e man brought it upon him|&s;elf, by his own folly and wickedne&s;s, before he had any thing of it.&mdash;We have &s;een, that the way our Saviour took to convince men, their rejection of him and his go&s;|pel was their &s;in, was by &s;hewing them, it could proceed from nothing but the badne&s;s of their hearts; and not by leading them to believe it was primarily owing to a mere weakne&s;s or di&s;order in their <HI>under&s;tandings,</HI> occa&s;i|oned by the original fall. He readily admitted that if men were blind, or if they had not &s;ufficient means of information and conviction, their unbelief would be no &s;in. But when he could prove to them that it could be owing to nothing but their hating the light, becau&s;e their deeds were evil, this he &s;uppos'd fairly implied their condemnation, and left them no cloak for their &s;in. Nor does it appear that any unbelievers in tho&s;e times, had refin'd &s;o far as to reply in their own vindi|cation, that they could not help hating the light, becau&s;e their hearts were evil. This &s;eems to be a cloak for un|belief, of a more modern invention.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE have &s;een that <HI>common &s;en&s;e,</HI> mo&s;t readily and fully giv<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> into &s;uch a difference as this, in all common ca&s;es; in every &s;uppo&s;able ca&s;e in which the vindication of our own character is not concerned. Yea in ca&s;es where men are mo&s;t intere&s;ted, and mo&s;t &s;traitned for a plea in their own ju&s;tification, they rarely think of plead|ing a bad intention, and a very wicked heart. If a man, when que&s;tion'd for a &s;uppo&s;ed faulty action, can &s;hew that it was an over&s;ight, and not owing to any ill de&s;ign; or if he can make appear, that he had not opportunity or capacity, to do better than he did; the&s;e, are always allow'd to be things to his purpo&s;e. But it is rare that any one undertakes to excu&s;e him&s;elf, as to any injuri|ous conduct, or omi&s;&s;ion of duty, with re&s;pect to his fel|low men, by &s;hewing that he is, and always was, of an

exceeding wicked and unrighteous di&s;po&s;ition, and that has <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> was quite as bad as his <HI>conduct.</HI> No one, un|le&s;s he was out of his wits, would ever think of making &s;uch a plea as this before a human court. It is only in matters of religion, and before the divine tribunal, on their la&s;t, deci&s;ive trial, that criminals them&s;elves think of making this plea, or that it would avail any thing, unle&s;s to their greater condemnation.</P>
<P>AND we have &s;een, that the rea&s;on why &s;inners are ready to look upon a wicked heart as a good excu&s;e in matters of religion, is becau&s;e they <HI>mean</HI> no &s;uch thing by it, nor do they think they <HI>have</HI> any &s;uch thing as, a heart at all wicked. When they talk of moral depravi|ty, deadne&s;s in &s;in, want of a di&s;po&s;ition to that which is good, &amp;c. They really mean by &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions&mdash;they know not what. Something that is con&s;i&s;tent with their <HI>&s;incerely</HI> wi&s;hing, de&s;iring, and <HI>endeavouring</HI> to the utmo&s;t of their natural power, to do their whole duty. And this is all the rea&s;on they think a bad heart is an excu&s;e with re&s;pect to the&s;e things, any more than in other ca&s;es. This is the rea&s;on why, in their view, "&s;in is dead," and looks like &s;uch a kind of thing as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be al|ways dead; it not being po&s;&s;ible in the nature of things that it &s;hould be alive, longer than only ju&s;t to bring it&s;elf into exi&s;tence!</P>
<P>IT may therefore, notwith&s;tanding this &s;eeming ex|ception, well be con&s;idered as a quite univer&s;al dictate of common &s;en&s;e; that the want of a heart, and the want of natural capacity, in regard to excu&s;ing men, are intirely different things.</P>
