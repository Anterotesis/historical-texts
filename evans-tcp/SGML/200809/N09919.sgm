<HEAD>THE IMPOTENCY OF SINNERS, <HI>&amp;c,</HI>
<Q><BIBL>JOHN vi. 44.</BIBL>
<P>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath &s;ent me, draw him.</P></Q></HEAD>
<P>OUR SAVIOUR, in the preceeding parts of the chap|ter, had repre&s;ented <HI>him&s;elf</HI> as the bread of life; and &s;aid: <HI>He that cometh to me &s;hall never hunger, and he that believeth on me &s;hall never thir&s;t.</HI> This repre&s;entation gave umbrage to the Jews becau&s;e it in&s;inuated the in|&s;ufficiency of the rites and &s;acrifices of <HI>their law,</HI> to purge the con&s;cience; and contained a tacit reprehen|&s;ion of them, for the undue confidence they had placed in the Mo&s;aic offerings and in&s;titutions. The <HI>manna,</HI> the bread which Mo&s;es gave them in the wilderne&s;s, they con&s;idered as a te&s;timony from Heaven that their religion was from GOD; and, that a careful compli|ance with the forms and modes of their wor&s;hip, was &s;ufficient to bring them into the divine favour, and &s;e|cure to them eternal life. And this te&s;timony in fa|vour of their religion, in feeding the <HI>whole congregation</HI> of the Jews, not only <HI>once</HI> but <HI>forty years,</HI> they viewed as more convincing and irrefragable, than any of the miracles which had been wrought by CHRIST. Our LORD lets them know, that whatever they might think of the <HI>manna</HI> that was rained down in the wil|derne&s;s, <HI>HE</HI> was the true bread which came down from Heaven: And although, from a vain and proud confi|dence
<PB REF="012616_0003_0F8B6CF644AAFA10">
in their conformities to the Jewi&s;h ritual, <HI>they</HI> might reject him; yet all that the Father gave him &s;hould come to him and believe on him, and <HI>he</HI> would give them <HI>eternal life.</HI> This brought into view the &s;ovreignty of GOD, in the &s;alvation of &s;inners, and therefore more effectually &s;tung the pride of the Jews&punc; upon which they immediately fell to murmuring, upon hearing him repre&s;ent him&s;elf in the light of &s;o much importance. The clearne&s;s of our SAVIOUR's rea&s;on|ings, the excellency of his doctrine, together with the mighty miracles which he wrought, being in&s;ufficient to convince the ob&s;tinate Jews, naturally brought into view the nece&s;&s;ity of divine, almighty power, in order to bring men cordially to embrace him, and believe on him. Therefore he &s;ays, <HI>murmur not among your&s;elves. No man can come to me, except the Father which hath &s;ent me draw him.</HI> They were to know that the &s;alvation which he offered, was all of GOD: That, as the &s;alva|tion it&s;elf was of GOD, &s;o al&s;o was the <HI>heart</HI> to comply with the offers and propo&s;als of it: That, <HI>it was not of man nor in man to receive and embrace him, unle&s;s it were given him of</HI> GOD. This &s;eems to be the import of our SAVIOUR's rea&s;oning, and this the true import of the text.</P>
<P>BUT, as the terms which are here u&s;ed to denote the nece&s;&s;ity and importance of &s;pecial divine influence, in order to bring men to believe on CHRIST, and embrace him, imply <HI>&s;ome kind of impotency</HI> in men with re&s;pect to <HI>coming</HI> and <HI>believing</HI>; many find it difficult to reconcile them with other parts of &s;cripture, which repre&s;ent <HI>impe|nitence</HI> and <HI>infidelity</HI> as the <HI>greate&s;t of &s;ins.</HI> If, <HI>no man can</HI> come to CHRIST except the FATHER draw him, people cannot di&s;cern the <HI>criminality</HI> of remaining <HI>unbelievers.</HI></P>
<P>THE de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e is to obviate this &s;eeming difficulty; and to &s;hew, that <HI>the impotency there is in natural</HI> MEN <HI>to believe on</HI> CHRIST, <HI>is altogether con&s;i&s;tent with the infinite criminality of unbelief.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to illu&s;trate the &s;ubject, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enquire,

<ITEM>III. WHENCE ari&s;eth the nece&s;&s;ity of divine and al|mighty power, the <HI>&s;pecial influences of the &s;pirit of</HI> GOD, in order to bring men to repent, and believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. WE are to enquire what that <HI>impotency</HI> is, in &s;in|ners, with re&s;pect to coming to CHRIST, which is ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the terms, <HI>no man can come, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to right apprehen&s;ions of the nature of that impotency, which is in fallen men, to that holy obedi|ence to which men are univer&s;ally called in the word of GOD; it may be proper for us to examine into the meaning of the terms <HI>can</HI> and <HI>cannot,</HI> and enquire in what &s;en&s;e they are generally u&s;ed, both in the holy &s;criptures and in common language.</P>
<P>THESE terms are &s;ometimes u&s;ed in common lan|guage, and I apprehend al&s;o in the &s;acred writings, to denote only <HI>natural con&s;i&s;tency and po&s;&s;ibility in the nature of things,</HI> or the rever&s;e. Thus we &s;ay an effect <HI>cannot</HI> exi&s;t without its cau&s;e; a part <HI>cannot</HI> be greater than the whole; nor the whole greater than all its parts. In a &s;en&s;e &s;imilar to this, are the terms often u&s;ed in &s;crip|ture. Thus <HI>Bildad</HI> &s;ays, <Q><HI>Can</HI> the ru&s;h grow up without mire? <HI>Can</HI> the flag grow without water?</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job viii. 11</NOTE> Our Saviour al&s;o &s;ays, "<HI>No man can</HI> &s;erve two ma&s;ters."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Matt <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">i 24</NOTE>
So James &s;ays, <Q><HI>Can</HI> the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries, either a vine figs? So <HI>can no</HI> fountain both yield &s;alt water and fre&s;h.</Q>
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">James iii. 12.</NOTE> In like manner, it is unque&s;tionably true, that the &s;inner's coming to Chri&s;t is an effect which <HI>can ari&s;e from no other cau&s;e</HI> than the drawings of the Father; and it is in vain to look to <HI>any other &s;ource</HI> for &s;uch an effect.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="012616_0005_0F8B6CFA0CC81458">BUT the terms <HI>can</HI> and <HI>cannot,</HI> in &s;uch an application of them, have no reference <HI>to moral characters and actions,</HI> in determining them to be either virtuous or vicious. Becau&s;e a man <HI>cannot</HI> &s;erve <HI>two</HI> ma&s;ters, it doth not from thence follow that he <HI>ought</HI> not to &s;erve <HI>one</HI>: Becau&s;e no fountain <HI>can</HI> both yield &s;alt water and fre&s;h, and virtuous and vicious actions <HI>cannot</HI> proceed from the &s;ame principle; it by no means <HI>from thence</HI> follows, that men are not <HI>obliged</HI> to holy and virtuous action. And, becau&s;e coming to Chri&s;t is the effect of no other cau&s;e than the <HI>drawings of the Father,</HI> it would be very odd from thence to infer, that no man is under <HI>obligati|on</HI> to come to him. Such rea&s;oning as this would, at once, annul the whole law and go&s;pel; and, &s;up|po&s;e that moral obligation lies upon no Being but God. It would &s;uppo&s;e that the nece&s;&s;ary dependence of creatures, on the Creator, was incon&s;i&s;tent with mo|ral obligation, and de&s;troyed it.</P>
<P>The terms <HI>can</HI> and <HI>cannot</HI> therefore, in <HI>this</HI> u&s;e and im|port of them, having no reference to moral characters and qualities, in determining them to be either good or bad; we have no further concern with them in the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e; the de&s;ign of which is to &s;hew that the <HI>impo|tency</HI> there is in mankind, with re&s;pect to coming to Chri&s;t, and believing on him, affords no one any rea&s;on|able excu&s;e for neglecting it.</P>
<P>Our bu&s;ine&s;s now, therefore is, to enquire into the u&s;e which is made of the&s;e terms, both in the holy &s;criptures, and in common language, as far as they re&s;pect the <HI>characters</HI> of men; and, wherein they relate to tho&s;e powers of moral beings which are e&s;&s;ential to virtue and vice, prai&s;e and blame.</P>
<P>And, here let it be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the terms <HI>can</HI> and <HI>cannot,</HI> often refer to the <HI>natural abilities, &s;trength</HI> or <HI>opportunity</HI> any man hath, for doing or performing any action that is propo&s;ed to him. We &s;ay men <HI>can</HI> or <HI>cannot</HI> perform any action, or do any deed, according as they have, or have not

&s;trength, talents, or oppo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="6 letters">y for it. Thus men <HI>cannot</HI> &s;oar above the clouds, nor overturn the moun|tains. So, the blind <HI>cannot</HI> &s;ee, nor the deaf hear. Men <HI>cannot</HI> bind the &s;weet influences of Pleiades, nor loo&s;e the bands of Orion. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job xxxviii. 31.</NOTE> Men <HI>have not</HI> an arm like God, nor can they thunder with a voice like him. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job xl. 9.</NOTE> So, men <HI>cannot</HI> rea&s;on with the power and &s;trength of angels, nor <HI>can</HI> any creature comprehend God. Some things it may be &s;aid men <HI>cannot</HI> perform, only for want of opportunity. Thus many <HI>cannot</HI> under&s;tand the &s;ci|ences and arts, the rea&s;onings of <HI>Newton,</HI> or the demon|&s;trations of <HI>Euclid,</HI> becau&s;e they have not had opportu|nity to &s;tudy and acquaint them&s;elves with them. To denote &s;uch a kind of impotency as this is the term <HI>can|not</HI> often u&s;ed in the &s;acred &s;criptures. Thus we are told that <Q>When <HI>I&s;aac</HI> was old, and his eyes were dim, &s;o that he <HI>could not</HI> &s;ee, he called <HI>E&s;au,</HI> his elde&s;t &s;on,</Q> &amp;c. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxvii. 1.</NOTE> And that

<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. iii. 2.</NOTE> So, in the &s;torm which befel the &s;hip in which <HI>Jonah</HI> was, when he fled from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, after the &s;ailors had ca&s;t lots, and it had fallen upon <HI>Jonah</HI>; it is &s;aid
<Q>The men rowed hard to bring the &s;hip to land, but they <HI>could not.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jonah i. 3.</NOTE> And the prophet Daniel, tacitly blames the king Nebuchad|nezzar for requiring it of the magicians and a&s;trologers to reveal his dreams to him, and &s;ays,

<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Dan. ii. 27.</NOTE></P>
<P>SUCH a kind of impotency to any thing as this, is always &s;uppo&s;ed to excu&s;e from the performance: This &s;ort of <HI>cannot,</HI> is incon&s;i&s;tent with every idea of moral obligation. Moral obligation lies upon <HI>that which is,</HI> not upon <HI>that which is not.</HI> Therefore <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith,
<Q>If there be fir&s;t a willing mind, it is accepted according

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. viii 12.</NOTE> Neither <HI>I&s;aac</HI> nor <HI>Eli</HI> were criminal for <HI>not being able</HI> to &s;ee; nor the &s;ailors; becau&s;e they <HI>could not</HI> reach the &s;hore; nor the a&s;trologers and magicians, becau&s;e they <HI>could not</HI> reveal the king's &s;ecret. And, if <HI>this</HI> was the nature of the impotency brought upon mankind by the fall, they could not be deemed crimi|nal for not performing tho&s;e actions, and that &s;ervice, which otherwi&s;e might have been expected and requir|ed of them. To relieve the mind under the unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions which naturally po&s;&s;e&s;s it upon a con|viction of having neglected <HI>mercy, and the love of God; this</HI> notion of the impotency derived to men by the <HI>fall,</HI> has however been invented and applied to mankind in their pre&s;ent depraved &s;tate. This is one of tho&s;e <HI>idle excu&s;es</HI> with which the fertile inventions of men have furni&s;hed the &s;inner's con&s;cience. And, &s;o long as the &s;inner imagines that he can avail him&s;elf of it, every attempt to di&s;turb that repo&s;e which he takes in impe|nitency and unbelief, will be in vain. You may as ea|&s;ily convince the &s;inner's con&s;cience of criminality in the &s;ight of the ju&s;t God, for not taming the wild bea&s;ts of the de&s;ert, as for not curbing his own lu&s;ts, and tam|ing the fero&s;ity of his own heart; &s;o long as he thinks his impotency to the <HI>latter,</HI> is the &s;ame as 'tis to the <HI>for|mer.</HI> And, &s;o long as we can excu&s;e our&s;elves to our own con&s;ciences, &s;o long we &s;hall undoubtedly think our&s;elves excu&s;able in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. The terms <HI>can</HI> and <HI>cannot,</HI> as they are often u&s;ed, both in the &s;acred &s;criptures, and in common language, refer to internal, mental di&s;po&s;itions, the affections of the heart. We frequently u&s;e the term <HI>cannot,</HI> to denote unwillingne&s;s or backwardne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition; and, to expre&s;s a high degree of unwillingne&s;s, a &s;trong aver&s;i|on of the mind, we often &s;ay we <HI>cannot.</HI> When we &s;ay we <HI>cannot</HI> comply with propo&s;als that are made to us, we often mean no more than that our minds are exceed|ingly
<PB N="9" REF="012616_0008_0F8B6CFDCE38A000">
a ver&s;e from it. Thus we often hear pea&s;ons &s;ay they <HI>cannot</HI> be willing&mdash;they <HI>cannot</HI> agree&mdash;they <HI>connot</HI> con|&s;ent, &amp;c. when we take them to mean nothing more than that their di&s;po&s;itions, their wills are &s;trongly a|ver&s;e, and exceedingly indi&s;po&s;ed to certain objects or propo&s;als.

And yet both the&s;e may be imagined, with as much rea&s;on, as, that it is no <HI>vice</HI> in the &s;innes that he <HI>cannot</HI> come to CHRIST and believe on him.

<P>WE now proceed to enquire,</P>
<P N="2">II. WHETHER this impotency affords any rea&s;ona|ble excu&s;e to the &s;inner, for continuing in impenitency and unbelief.</P>
<P>THIS impotency, it is to be kept in mind, con&s;i&s;teth in a real <HI>aver&s;ion of the will</HI> from the law of GOD, from holine&s;s, from the character of the LORD JESUS. It

doth not con&s;i&s;t in &s;uch a <HI>want</HI> of affection and love as is to be found in inanimate nature, or in the brutal creation: Nor does it con&s;i&s;t in &s;uch a want of love, as we often expre&s;s by the term <HI>indifference.</HI> Many times the &s;tate and di&s;po&s;ition of the mind is &s;uch, re&s;pect|ing certain objects and things, as that it is difficult to determine which way it preponderates, and whether the mind be plea&s;ed or di&s;plea&s;ed with them; if there is a preponderancy of the affections, it is, neverthele&s;s, &s;o &s;mall as to be &s;carcely di&s;cernable.</P>
<P>SUCH a &s;tate of mind as this, is never, in common language, expre&s;&s;ed by the term <HI>cannot</HI>; but, to denote &s;uch an indifferency as this, we always u&s;e &s;ome more &s;oft and gentle term&mdash;&s;ome word or epithet which de|notes a &s;tate of mind con&s;iderably removed from every thing to which the ideas of <HI>impotency</HI> are wont to be af|fixed by mankind.</P>
<P>BUT, when the <HI>aver&s;ion of the will</HI> is &s;uch that no arts of per&s;wa&s;ion will overcome it, and no motives or rea|&s;ons will &s;ubdue and conquer it; then common language affords a term which denotes a certain kind of impo&s;&s;i|bility; and, to expre&s;s this exceeding &s;trength of op|po&s;ition in the will, common &s;en&s;e adopts it, and, we &s;ay we <HI>cannot</HI> comply with &s;uch precepts or propo&s;als.</P>
<P>IT being then remembered that the impotency &s;pok|en of in our text, denoted by the terms <HI>no man can come to me,</HI> &amp;c. implies a <HI>real and exceedingly &s;trong aver&s;ion of the will,</HI> in the &s;inner, from coming unto CHRIST; it is to be enquired whether <HI>this impotency</HI> with re&s;pect to his coming, affords him any rea&s;onable excu&s;e for ne|glecting it.</P>
<P N="1">1. IN human affairs this &s;ort of impotency is never e&s;teemed any excu&s;e.

For the child to &s;ay that he <HI>could not</HI> love his parents or his brethren, nor <HI>could</HI> &s;ubmit to the whole&s;ome rules and regulations of his family; would be &s;o far from &s;ugge&s;ting a <HI>rea&s;on</HI> for

di&s;obedience, that it would manife&s;t its peculiar aggra|vation. Good and whole&s;ome rules of family and govern|ment, are impracticable only to the ob&s;tinacy and per|ver&s;ene&s;s of the child, or the &s;ervant. And ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s, according to all the dictates of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, and all the methods of <HI>human</HI> admi|ni&s;tration and government, the higher they ri&s;e, are the more cen&s;urable and inexcu&s;able. For the child to &s;ay that he <HI>cannot</HI> love and honor his parents, is &s;o far from &s;ugge&s;ting an <HI>excu&s;e</HI> for his undutifulne&s;s, that, <HI>above all things,</HI> it &s;hews his need of cha&s;ti&s;ement and correction, and much more &s;o doth the like plea for undutifulne&s;s to GOD: For, our obligations of love and duty to the &s;upreme GOD, ari&s;ing from the infinite perfection and purity of his nature, and the relation which we &s;tand in to him, are infinitely &s;uperior to tho&s;e of filial duty and affec|tion: And, therefore, a perver&s;ene&s;s, an ob&s;tinacy of will <HI>in this ca&s;e,</HI> which ari&s;es to &s;uch a height as to au|thori&s;e the u&s;e of the term <HI>cannot</HI> for denoting and ex|pre&s;&s;ing it, mu&s;t &s;urely <HI>highly</HI> merit the ju&s;t judgment and righteous indignation of GOD.</P>

of men perfectly corre&s;ponds. For, when a child doth not love a wi&s;e and tender parent, he is univer&s;ally judged to be criminal: But, when his aver&s;ion from his parent has ari&s;en to &s;uch a height, that all means and methods to bring him to a &s;en&s;e of his duty, prove ineffec|tual, and he plainly declares that he cannot love him, his wickedne&s;s is univer&s;ally judged to be exceedingly great.</P>
<P N="3">3. It would be very ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that di&s;affect|ion of heart to the true character of the LORD JHSUS, is excu&s;eable on account of its &s;trength and greatne&s;s. It has been already ob&s;erved that the term <HI>cannot,</HI> as it is often u&s;ed in &s;cripture, and the phra&s;e <HI>no man can,</HI> as u&s;ed in our text, as far as it relates to the character of the &s;ubject, is de&s;igned to expre&s;s <HI>an exceeding &s;trength of oppo&s;ition of will,</HI> to certain objects or propo&s;als. That degree of di&s;affection and di&s;like, which is &s;o weak and low, as not to admit of the term <HI>cannot</HI> for expre&s;&s;ing it; and which doth not generally &s;ugge&s;t the idea of any &s;ort of <HI>impo&s;&s;ibility</HI>; by the common con&s;ent of mankind, is univer&s;ally thought to partake of the na|ture of either virtue or vice, according to the &s;everal natures and qualities of its object. And, if &s;uch a low degree of backwardne&s;s with re&s;pect to coming to CHRIST, as we &s;hould not expre&s;s by a term that &s;ug|ge&s;ted any impo&s;&s;ibility in the ca&s;e, yet, according to the dictates of common rea&s;on, and by the univer&s;al con&s;ent of mankind is deemed criminal: it would be very re|markable that this &s;ame backwardne&s;s of heart with re|&s;pect to coming, when it has ari&s;en to &s;uch height, and exi&s;teth in &s;uch &s;trength, as that, according to the com|mon u&s;e of language, it may with propriety be &s;aid thta the &s;ubject of it <HI>cannot</HI> come; &s;hould <HI>then</HI> be deemed in|nocent and excu&s;eable. Such a method of rea&s;oning and infering as this, at once confounds all human rules of computation re&s;pecting different degrees of vice, and the &s;everal alleviations or aggravations of crimes. If a low degree of di&s;affection to CHRIST is criminal, a higher degree of it mu&s;t be proportionably more &s;o;
<PB N="20" REF="012616_0019_0F8B6D0F0D550E30">
and when the di&s;affection ari&s;es to &s;uch a height as to render it impracticable for the &s;ubject of it to come to him, and is of &s;uch a &s;trength and malignity as to re|quire the term <HI>cannot</HI> fully and properly to expre&s;s it; neither the dictates of &s;cripture, nor of common rea&s;on, would he&s;itate a moment to pronounce it far more vile and criminal. When the di&s;affection of any one, to CHRIST, is &s;uch as that he <HI>cannot</HI> come to him, and be|lieve on him, was not his con&s;cience amazingly &s;tupid and blind, in&s;tead of drawing any excu&s;e from <HI>this im|potency,</HI> he would <HI>feel it to be</HI> his own wickedne&s;s, and that it con&s;tituted the very e&s;&s;ence of it, and would, in his <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> condemn him&s;elf to an everla&s;ting hell for it, when he is endued with rea&s;on and under&s;tanding to di&s;cern the fitne&s;&s;es of things; when the infinitely excel|lent character of the LORD JESUS is exhibited &s;en&s;ibly to his ob&s;ervation and view; when his judgment and con|&s;cience approve, and pronounce it excellent and perfect in every part: <HI>Then</HI> to feel &s;uch &s;trength of aver&s;ion of will from CHRIST, as that he <HI>cannot</HI> come to him and em|brace him in his proper character; the &s;inner would at once know, was an <HI>impotency</HI> of a mo&s;t horrid nature, a crime of the deepe&s;t dye, which <HI>of it&s;elf</HI> rendered him a ve&s;&s;el of wrath fit for nothing but de&s;truction.</P>
<P>IT is, indeed, nothing but abominable &s;tupidity of con&s;cience, and of heart, that ever &s;ugge&s;ted <HI>that impo|tency in the &s;inner</HI> with re&s;pect to coming to CHRIST, which is meant to be expre&s;&s;ed by the terms, <HI>no man can come unto me, &amp;c.</HI> as an excu&s;e for not repenting and be|lieving on the LORD JESUS.

<P>THERE is, in fact, <HI>no impotency in &s;inners</HI> under the Go&s;pel, to repentance and faith, (which at all affects their moral characters, or has any relation to their prai&s;e worthine&s;s, or criminality) be&s;ide what is <HI>volun|tary</HI> and con&s;i&s;ts e&s;&s;entially in the oppo&s;ition of their <HI>wills.</HI> And to plead <HI>this impotency</HI> as an excu&s;e, is to plead wickedne&s;s it&s;elf as its own excu&s;e.</P>
<P>IF voluntary oppo&s;ition to GOD is &s;inful; the &s;in|ner's impotence to repent and believe is &s;inful; be|cau&s;e the very <HI>impotence it&s;elf</HI> con&s;i&s;teth in voluntary op|po&s;ition. And, if voluntary oppo&s;ition to GOD is &s;in|ful, the point of controver&s;y is certainly determined; for <HI>&s;infulne&s;s it&s;elf</HI> cannot be excu&s;eable.</P>
<P>THE &s;inner who pleads this impotency, when the duty and obligation of repentance and faith are urged upon him, it may be pre&s;umed, is not yet become &s;en|&s;ible that he is an enemy to GOD: He is not yet convin|ced that the feelings, the voluntary affection of his own heart toward GOD are &s;inful, or &s;uch as de&s;erve cen&s;ure and blame. Was the &s;inner once effectually convinced of this, his con&s;cience would at once feel the real obli|gation of repentance; and, this conviction mu&s;t im|mediately di&s;arm him of every excu&s;e. For,</P>
<P N="5">5. IF, voluntary oppo&s;ition to GOD is not &s;inful; if real, actual unwillingne&s;s to come to CHRIST, is not cri|minal, it mu&s;t be <HI>becau&s;e we are not in rea&s;on an&s;werable to</HI> GOD&mdash;<HI>becau&s;e he hath no right to command our wills,</HI> and call upon us to love him. To &s;ay that we are not blameable for per&s;i&s;ting in impenitency, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> GOD doth not give us <HI>a heart, a will</HI> to repent; is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, that GOD hath no right to command us to re|pent of &s;in and love him, unle&s;s at the &s;ame time he
<PB N="22" REF="012616_0021_0F8B6D12317A0FB8">
gives us hearts to comply. And this, every one mu&s;t &s;ee, is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, that GOD's commands are not binding upon any but tho&s;e to whom he gives hearts to obey. According to &s;uch rea&s;oning as this, it is very obvious, that <HI>impenitent &s;inners</HI> cannot righteou&s;ly be commanded to repent and believe on the LORD JESUS. And this indeed is the grand object which the &s;inner has in view; the darling point to which all his pleas and excu&s;es tend.</P>
<P>IF the &s;inner is ab&s;olved from the obligation of re|pentance and faith, by the con&s;ideration that GOD hath not given him a heart to repent and believe the go&s;pel, it is then manife&s;t, of cour&s;e, that all impenitent &s;in|ners are freed from moral obligation. And, if this is a con&s;ideration that di&s;&s;olves moral obligation; it mu&s;t be becau&s;e GOD hath no right to enjoin any thing up|on the creature, be&s;ide what he is di&s;po&s;ed and hath a heart to perform. But, was this the truth, it would be obvious that the <HI>di&s;po&s;ition and will</HI> of the creature, mu&s;t be the only rule and mea&s;ure of the divine commands; and therefore the only rule and mea&s;ure of his duty. <HI>This</HI> every one may &s;ee, is a rule and method of rea&s;on|ing&punc; which at once cancels all moral obligation; mak|ing <HI>the will of the creature</HI> his own and only law; and denying all authority which the Deity hath over men. Such rea&s;onings as the&s;e are the &s;ugge&s;tions of a heart impatient of every re&s;traint, and fruitful in inventions for ea&s;ing the con&s;cience from every &s;en&s;e of moral ob|ligation.</P>
<P>IF the &s;inner is indeed under <HI>obligations</HI> of repentance toward GOD, and faith toward our LORD JESUS CHRIST, it is utterly in vain to urge any con&s;ideration whatever in excu&s;e of impenitence and unbelief. If GOD, who judgeth righteous judgment, con&s;iders a rejection of CHRIST as being blameworthy and criminal; it is plain that&punc; in his view, there is no <HI>cannot</HI> in the &s;inner, with re&s;pect to his coming to him, that takes off the obliga|tion of it. The &s;inner ought to feel and know there|fore,
<PB N="23" REF="012616_0022_0F8B6D1339EDF4C0">
that all his excu&s;es for remaining impenitent, be|tray his impatience of the obligation of the divine law; and, undoubtedly have their origin in a real di&s;po&s;ition of heart to annul the judgments of GOD, and break his bands a&s;under.</P>
<P N="6">6. TO urge that there cannot be obligation on a creature to love GOD, unle&s;s where the DEITY gives a heart, or di&s;po&s;ition to comply with the precepts of love, is the &s;ame as to &s;ay that we cannot con&s;ent to be <HI>creatures, dependent</HI> on GOD, and yet accountable to him. To urge an indi&s;po&s;ition of mind to comply with di|vine precepts, as an excu&s;e for oppo&s;ition to them; is to deny the mutual con&s;i&s;tency of <HI>dependence</HI> and <HI>moral obligation.</HI> To lay the blame of an indi&s;po&s;ition to obe|dience, at GOD's door, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> a heart or di&s;po&s;ition to obey, is only from GOD; is to urge the con&s;ideration of the <HI>dependence</HI> of the creature on GOD, as an argument again&s;t the <HI>obligation of obedience.</HI> For, if the ideas of <HI>entire dependence,</HI> and of <HI>moral obligation,</HI> are no ways in|con&s;i&s;tent with each other; the con&s;ideration of our being <HI>creatures ab&s;olutely dependent</HI> on GOD, is certainly no manner of excu&s;e for our being and continuing enemies to him.</P>
<P>THE excu&s;e, therefore, of <HI>cannot,</HI> &s;o often urged by the &s;inner, and &s;o difficultly yielded up, when the duty of repenting and believing the go&s;pel is brought into view, really terminates here; and betrays the &s;ecret de|&s;ire, the latent wi&s;hes of his heart, after <HI>independence on God.</HI> Would we con&s;ent to be <HI>creatures,</HI> and, in the di&s;po&s;itions and affections of our minds, <HI>take our place</HI> accordingly; every difficulty in the way of our coming to CHRIST, would at once &s;ub&s;ide, and be removed; and we &s;hould then find no <HI>cannot</HI> with re&s;pect to coming that would be any bar in the way of it, or, for a mo|ment, keep us at a di&s;tance from him.</P>
<P>IT is of the utmo&s;t importance, therefore, that the &s;inner &s;hould <HI>know</HI> and <HI>feel</HI> that <HI>this excu&s;e</HI> is mo&s;t per|fectly in&s;ignificant, and infinitely vain: and, that we &s;hould all be effectually per&s;uaded and convinced that
<PB N="24" REF="012616_0023_0F8B6D158C0072E0">
our <HI>impotency</HI> to love &s;o exalted and glorious a charac|ter, is &s;o far from excu&s;ing us, that it is the <HI>very thing</HI> which con&s;titutes our wickedne&s;s, and renders us &s;o infinitely vile and odious in the pure eyes of the holy GOD. <HI>This impotency</HI> is &s;o far from being a rea&s;on why the impenitent &s;inner <HI>&s;hould not be damned</HI>; that it is the very thing, above all others, on account of which he de&s;erves everla&s;ting burnings. <HI>However</HI> the powers and faculties of the human mind may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be impaired by the fall; or, <HI>whatever debility and weak|ne&s;s</HI> may be derived to mankind from <HI>Adam</HI>; &s;till, there can be no rea&s;onable objection to our employing all the powers and faculties <HI>which remain,</HI> in the &s;ervice of GOD: However our powers may be impaired, the duty and obligation of a faithful improvement of tho&s;e which are <HI>left us,</HI> remain &s;till in full force.

<P N="3">III. WHENCE ari&s;eth the nece&s;&s;ity of divine and al|mighty power, the <HI>&s;pecial influences of the &s;pirit of God,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="012616_0024_0F8B6D160C1166B8">
in order to bring men to repent, and believe on the Lord JESUS CHRIST. Our text &s;ays, "No man can come to me, <HI>except the Father which hath &s;ent me draw him.</HI>" In order to under&s;tand the true ground of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;pecial divine influences in bringing men to CHRIST, we may ob&s;erve the following things. Such as,</P>
<P N="1">1. No effect ever takes place without &s;ome &s;ufficient and adequate cau&s;e. It is an acknowledged maxim, that every <HI>effect</HI> requires a <HI>cau&s;e</HI>; and <HI>that</HI> &s;uch an one as is adequate to it, and &s;ufficient for the production of it. If <HI>this</HI> point be given up, almo&s;t all principles of rea&s;oning are, at once unhinged; and we are &s;et at loo&s;e from all certainty re&s;pecting the mo&s;t important and acknowledged truths. All <HI>created</HI> exi&s;tence is the effect of divine and almighty power; <HI>an effect</HI> to the production of which nothing &s;hort of omnipotence is adequate. It is the prerogative of GOD, proper and peculiar to him, to <HI>create</HI> and, out of nothing produce exi&s;tence. So that wherever we behold <HI>created exi&s;tence,</HI> we have an infallible, never failing proof of <HI>divine al|mighty power.</HI> No exi&s;tence, either in whole or in part, <HI>creates it&s;elf.</HI> In this &s;en&s;e every thing, every effect, re|quires almighty power.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>&s;inner's coming to</HI> CHRIST is an effect to which nothing is adequate, as a cau&s;e, be&s;ide the drawings of the FATHER: This is an effect only of the <HI>&s;pecial influ|ences of the &s;pirit of</HI> GOD. <HI>That divine power</HI> whereby GOD effecteth meer creation&mdash;whereby he produced the material &s;y&s;tem, our natural world into exi&s;tence: is wholly inadequate to &s;uch an effect. Yea, <HI>that divine power</HI> whereby GOD alone formeth moral nature, brings men into being and upholds them in exi&s;tence, is not a cau&s;e equal to the production of <HI>holine&s;s in a &s;inner's heart.</HI> This power alone, in however high a mea&s;ure it is exerted will not bring a &s;inner to repent, and be|lieve on the LORD JESUS. The peculiar glory even of the <HI>power</HI> of GOD, appears in the new creation: And, this <HI>new creation</HI> never takes place otherwi&s;e than as an
<PB N="26" REF="012616_0025_0F8B6D18438E9948">
effect of the <HI>&s;pecial influences of the &s;pirit of</HI> GOD. There|fore, they who receive CHRIST and believe on him, are repre&s;ented as being born <HI>not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of</HI> GOD. John i. 13. And our SAVIOUR &s;aith that <HI>except a man be born of water</HI> and the &s;pirit, <HI>he cannot enter into the kingdom of</HI> GOD. John iii, 5. GOD, in bringing men to CHRIST, draws them <HI>with the cords of a man, with bands of love.</HI> Ho&s;ea xi. 4. And it is not in the heart of man to come to CHRIST, unle&s;s he is thus drawn of GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That,</HI> on the &s;inner's part, which alone renders the &s;pecial influences of the &s;pirit of GOD, nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential to his coming to CHRIST, is <HI>ob&s;tinacy of will and di&s;affection of heart.</HI> When we &s;peak of the nece&s;|&s;ity of the exertion of &s;ome &s;pecial influence on a crea|ture <HI>who is every way furni&s;hed with abilities and powers for moral action,</HI> in order to bring him to a compliance with the dictates of rea&s;on and right; with <HI>duty</HI> and <HI>obligati|on</HI>; it naturally awakens an apprehen&s;ion of <HI>&s;omething in the &s;inner him&s;elf, lying as an ob&s;tacle or bar in the way of his compliance with his duty.</HI> There is nothing <HI>in the &s;in|ner,</HI> which lies as a bar in the way of his repenting and believing the go&s;pel, be&s;ide this <HI>enmity and ob&s;tinacy of will. Enmity of heart, therefore, again&s;t</HI> GOD, <HI>oppo&s;ite of will to the</HI> LORD JESUS, to his character and work; are what alone, on the &s;inner's part, render &s;pecial, divine, <HI>&s;piritual</HI> influences nece&s;&s;ay to his being brought to re|pentance toward GOD, and faith toward our LORD JE|SUS CHRIST. Such is the enmity and wickedne&s;s of the hearts of &s;inners, as that <HI>it is not in them</HI> to come to CHRIST unle&s;s the Father draws them.</P>
<P>GOD, by his <HI>almighty power,</HI> continually upholds eve|ry one of us in being: He gives us rea&s;on and judg|ment to &s;ee and under&s;tand, and know that we ought to love him; but we will not. Therefore his <HI>almighty, &s;piri|tual power</HI> mu&s;t be put forth in order to bring us to it. For <HI>this rea&s;on</HI> it is that no man can come to CHRIST, except the Father draw him. Man hath &s;uch an <HI>aver|&s;ion
<PB N="27" REF="012616_0026_0F8B6D18B9C35A80">
of will</HI> from coming, that it <HI>is not in him</HI> to come. And when our SAVIOUR &s;aith that <HI>no man can come, &amp;c.</HI> he is &s;o far from de&s;igning to furni&s;h the &s;inner with an excu&s;e for impenitency and unbelief, that his words are excellently calculated to bring the wickedne&s;s of the impenitent &s;inner very fully and &s;en&s;ibly into his view. Nothing gives us &s;o &s;triking a view of the exceeding &s;trength of oppo&s;ition there is, in &s;inners hearts, to CHRIST, as to hear it repre&s;ented by <HI>him</HI> who is the true and faithful witne&s;s, as being &s;uch that, according to the common u&s;e of terms, it may properly be &s;aid that he <HI>cannot</HI> come unto him: For this teacheth us, that there is not only &s;ome degree of oppo&s;ition, but an exceeding &s;trength of enmity, in the carnal heart again&s;t the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WHAT has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, teacheth us, that converting grace, when fir&s;t be&s;towed upon a &s;in|ner, is always both an un&s;ought and an unpromi&s;ed favour. What is &s;aid re&s;pecting the Gentile world, is al&s;o equally true of every one whom divine grace over|takes, and whom GOD brings home into his kingdom, that <HI>he is &s;ought of them that a&s;ked not for him,</HI> that <HI>he is found of them that &s;ought him not.</HI> I&s;aiah lxv, 1.</P>
<P>IN a per&s;on who is &s;o oppo&s;ed to CHRIST as that he <HI>cannot</HI> come to him, it is in vain to expect any <HI>a&s;king</HI> or <HI>&s;eeking</HI> after him. We never a&s;k or &s;eek after that which is wholly di&s;agreeable to us; much le&s;s, if po&s;&s;i|ble, after that which is freely offered to us without money and without price, to which we have &s;uch an exceeding &s;trength of aver&s;ion and oppo&s;ition of will, as that we cannot accept and embrace it. To teach and exhort, therefore, impenitent &s;inners, to &s;eek and pray for converting, regenerating grace, <HI>under an appre|hen&s;ion that they are rather inclined to comply with &s;uch di|rections, than actually to repent and believe the go&s;pel,</HI> mu&s;t certainly ari&s;e from a wrong apprehen&s;ion of the nature
<PB N="28" REF="012616_0027_0F8B6D1C6E7AED00">
of that impotency there is in &s;inners re&s;pecting repent|ance and faith. And not only &s;o, but &s;uch kind of directions mu&s;t al&s;o, exceedingly tend to blind the &s;inner both with re&s;pect to his own character and duty, and keep out of view the real oppo&s;ition and enmity of his heart again&s;t GOD.</P>
<P>TO encourage &s;inners to hope that there are any pro|mi&s;es in the word of GOD, to any a&s;kings or &s;eekings which are not of faith, is to encourage them to tru&s;t in a refuge of lies: For, when we are directed to <HI>a&s;k,</HI> we are, at the &s;ame time, directed to a&s;k in faith, nothing wavering, and told that <HI>he that wavereth, is like a wave of the &s;ea, driven with the wind and to&s;&s;ed</HI>&punc; And then, to let us know how vain all <HI>&s;uch a&s;king is,</HI> the Apo&s;tle adds, <HI>let not that man think</HI> that he &s;hall receive any thing of the LORD. James i. 6, 7.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE &s;ee, in what has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, a rea&s;on why the divine law &s;hould loo&s;e none of its de|mands on &s;inners; and why there &s;hould be no relaxa|tion of its binding force and authority. If the circum|&s;tances and impotency of &s;inners were &s;uch as that rea&s;on would plead a relaxation of its demands upon us &s;ince the fall, and <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> dictate the propriety and importance of it; it would be exceedingly difficult for us to di&s;cern the nece&s;&s;ity or wi&s;dom of the atone|ment; or, &s;ee it to be <HI>even con&s;i&s;tent</HI> for CHRIST to come <HI>to magnify the law and make it honourable</HI>: For, on the other hand, <HI>this de&s;ign</HI> of the coming of CHRIST directly combats the principle which urgeth the <HI>rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of a relaxation, in the demands of the law, on account of the impotency there is in fallen men to comply with them.</P>
<P>If the demands of the divine law were above what in rea&s;on, could be required of <HI>fallen creatures</HI>; the e&s;&s;ential righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s of GOD, would have been &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for all rea&s;onable abatements, without the death of CHRIST, or any price paid as a ran&s;om from the power of too &s;evere and rigid a law. But, now all
<PB N="29" REF="012616_0028_0F8B6D1C97DB6048">
the original demands of the law upon mankind are kept up, becau&s;e we have lo&s;t no powers of obedience, which can, in the lea&s;t mea&s;ure, excu&s;e us from the obligati|ons of it.</P>
<P>SOME &s;eem to imagine that the right which the Deity hath to bind us to real holine&s;s and the perfection of it according to our mea&s;ure, in our pre&s;ent fallen &s;tate, ari&s;eth from the con&s;ideration of the &s;ufficiency of pow|ers with which human nature was <HI>originally endowed,</HI> without any regard to the nature and extent of the <HI>pre|&s;ent</HI> powers of mankind. Accordingly we often hear it &s;aid, that GOD <HI>hath not lo&s;t his right to command, though man hath his power to obey</HI>; than the which few &s;entences have ever been invented that were more directly calcu|lated to relieve and &s;tupify the con&s;cience of the &s;ecure &s;inner. For, in the fir&s;t place, though rea&s;on teaches us that for any one voluntarily to deprive him&s;elf of his ori|ginal powers of obedience, is <HI>in it&s;elf</HI> criminal, and de&s;erv|ing of puni&s;hment; yet <HI>this</HI> is a crime which, on the pre|&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, is chargeable on no one of mankind ex|cept the fir&s;t of the race. <HI>This</HI> therefore is a crime from which every one of the <HI>fallen</HI> race of men are taught, by the &s;entence under con&s;ideration, to con&s;ider them&s;elves as entirely free. And, in the &s;econd place, it is utterly impracticable, even by all the arts of &s;ubtilty of which the mo&s;t practi&s;ed critic is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, ever to convict the con&s;cience of &s;in, for not exerting and employing pow|ers of which the per&s;on was never in any meas&s;ure po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed. For, rea&s;on teaches us that the &s;ervant is not criminal for neglecting to run, at the ma&s;ter's command after he has di&s;located his joints or broken his bones; though he may be for his carele&s;sne&s;s, or violence offer|ed to him&s;elf, in breaking his legs. And, although, in the third place, the &s;inner &s;hould be per&s;uaded to be|lieve that, by &s;ome certain law or con&s;titution of go|vernment, he is holden to <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> for not exerting powers of which he never was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and of which <HI>Adam alone,</HI> was guilty of the crime of depriving him;
<PB N="30" REF="012616_0029_0F8B6D1E0110C808">
yet, he never will feel him&s;elf de&s;erving of it: And, his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of innocence will be as balm to the &s;oul, molifying and healing every wound that is in|flicted on him.</P>
<P>IS it po&s;&s;ible for any one who con&s;iders this as the ground of his expo&s;edenes&s;s to future puni&s;hment, to feel his need of an infinite atonement, and be brought to look only to boundle&s;s mercy, and &s;overeign grace, for relief? Is <HI>this</HI> that &s;en&s;e of &s;in and conviction of guilt, which prepares the mind for di&s;cerning the ex|cellency of the go&s;pel, and the glory of the mediatorial work and character? And are the&s;e the doctrines adapt|ed by infinite wi&s;dom, and awaken the con&s;ciences of &s;in|ners, and bring their own characters, in all their pollu|tion and deformity, into their view? Certainly no: But, on <HI>this</HI> &s;uppo&s;ition, the go&s;pel can only be, as it was heretofore to the Jews, a &s;tumbling block, and to the Greeks, fooli&s;hne&s;s. Under the influence of &s;uch in&s;tructions and apprehen&s;ions as the&s;e, it will be utter|ly impracticable for the &s;inner ever to attain to &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of &s;in as is altogether nece&s;&s;ary to his heartily im|bracing the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>GOD's law, and his right to command, remain in full force becau&s;e nothing is now required of us but what it is infinitely fit and rea&s;onable that we &s;hould perform.

And what better or more honorable do <HI>they</HI> think of the DEITY who imagine that his original demands of true and &s;upreme love, are abated, on account of the <HI>perver&s;e di&s;po&s;ition and inclinations of the &s;inner,</HI> and <HI>his</HI> calls and directions now &s;oftened and lowered down to the level of the &s;inner's <HI>pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition</HI>; &s;o that GOD <HI>now, immediately</HI> requires nothing of the <HI>impenitent</HI> &s;inner but what it may comport with his <HI>impenitent di&s;po&s;ition</HI> to perform. Nothing is more grateful to the impenitent &s;inner, than to hear him&s;elf directed to &s;ome exerci&s;es and doings &s;hort of real repentence as <HI>a means or conditi|on of finding favor</HI> with GOD; becau&s;e he feels that eve|ry &s;uch direction evidently ju&s;tifies the excu&s;e which he makes for remaining impenitent, drawn from his impotence re&s;pecting true repentence: And it incoura|ges him to hope for <HI>peace of con&s;cience</HI> upon &s;uch doings and performances as may comport with his pre&s;ent ut|ter indi&s;po&s;ition to the love of GOD, and aver&s;ion from it.

<P>WHAT can be more reproachful to the holy and ju&s;t GOD, than to &s;uppo&s;e either that he required an infinite price paid to him, before he would &s;uffer him&s;elf to be prevailed on to abate any thing of tho&s;e demands which neverthele&s;s, <HI>could not with rea&s;on be kept up upon depra|ved, fallen men, on account of their impotence to comply with them</HI>; or, that the influence of the atonement upon the divine mind was &s;uch, as to di&s;po&s;e the DEITY to yield a little in his demands, <HI>on account of the extreme back|wardne&s;s and indi&s;po&s;ition of the &s;inner to obey?</HI> And, yet, it is abundantly evident that either the one or the other of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, or &s;omething &s;imilar to them, is certainly implied in the opinion that any of the directi|ons of the word of GOD to &s;inners, have, for their ob|ject, any thing &s;hort of true, genuine, cordial love.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE may infer, from what has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, that the &s;inner who feels, and is really convinc|ed that this impotency to come to CHRIST, is <HI>his own fault, his crime,</HI> will never mention it as an excu&s;e.

When we plead an excu&s;e of a <HI>crime,</HI> it is &s;omething di&s;tinct from the crime it&s;elf. If the &s;inner's impotency to come to CHRIST is his own wickedne&s;s, it is an affront to the great GOD, to his law, and to his &s;on, JESUS CHRIST, for him to mention it in any other view than as con|demning him&s;elf for it. What would the parent think of the child who &s;hould &s;ay that he <HI>could not</HI> &s;ubmit to the whol&s;ome rules and regulations of the family&mdash;that he <HI>could not</HI> be &s;ubject to parental authority? He would be &s;o far from con&s;idering this as any tolerable excu&s;e, that he would <HI>infer from it,</HI> the child's need of &s;evere di&s;cipline and correction. What, then, mu&s;t the DEITY, the ju&s;t and holy GOD, think of the &s;inner, when he

hears him &s;ay that he <HI>cannot</HI> repent of his &s;ins, and <HI>cannot</HI> love the LORD JESUS? For the &s;inner to &s;ay that he <HI>can|not</HI> repent of his &s;ins, is to expre&s;s the exceeding &s;trength of his love to &s;in, and the amazing attachment of his own heart to his lu&s;ts. And to &s;ay that he <HI>cannot</HI> love the LORD JESUS CHRIST, it to expre&s;s the &s;trong, un|conquerable aver&s;ion of his mind and will from him.</P>
<P>DID &s;inners them&s;elves view the matter in this light, (as they certainly would do, were not their con&s;ciences exceedingly &s;tupid and blind) we never &s;hould hear them hold &s;uch a language as this, or talk in a &s;train &s;o exceedingly daring and provoking. To &s;ay that we <HI>cannot</HI> repent of our &s;ins, and <HI>cannot</HI> come to CHRIST; and plead <HI>this</HI> at the &s;ame time, as an excu&s;e for not re|penting and believing; is directly to fly in the face of the GREAT GOD, of his law, and of the glorious SAVIOUR of &s;inners. He that can talk in &s;uch a &s;train as this, and derive peace and quiet from <HI>this excu&s;e,</HI> we may rely upon it, has never yet been convinced, <HI>even in con&s;cience,</HI> that he is a &s;inner. For, if it is not our own fault, our wickedne&s;s, that we do not repent and be|lieve the go&s;pel, where can wickedne&s;s be found? If it is not our own fault that we do not repent and believe, we are certainly not <HI>&s;inful,</HI> on account of impenitence and unbelief: that is, our impenitence and unbelief are not <HI>our &s;in.</HI> And, if we are not &s;inners <HI>in this re&s;pect,</HI> certainly we are not in any other. And it cannot be that <HI>in this re&s;pect we are &s;inners,</HI> if that impotency with re&s;pect to repentence and faith, which is u&s;ually ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the term <HI>cannot,</HI> be a rea&s;onable excu&s;e for impenitence and unbelief.</P>
<P>THUS doth this excu&s;e of <HI>cannot,</HI> &s;o often in the &s;in|ner's mouth, in&s;tead of manife&s;ting any degree of awak|ening, re&s;pecting the things of religion, or any ju&s;t ap|prehen&s;ions of things, di&s;cover the exceeding &s;tupidity of his con&s;cience, and a very high degree of carnal ea&s;e and &s;ecurity. The danger of &s;uch, and the wretched|ne&s;s of their condition, is greater and more dreadful than can be imagined. And, unle&s;s it &s;hall plea&s;e GOD to &s;trike &s;uch light and conviction into their deluded

<P>HOW mu&s;t the &s;inner appear in the eyes ef that GOD who weigheth every thing in an even ballance, who&s;e commandments are all holy and ju&s;t and good, when HE requires him to love that which is, in it&s;elf, infinitely lovely and excellent, and mo&s;t perfectly worthy of our love; yet freely declaring and prote&s;ting that he <HI>cannot</HI> love him, that it is <HI>not in his power</HI> to do it; and urging <HI>this cannot,</HI> at the &s;ame time, as an <HI>excu&s;e for remaining an enemy to God</HI>!

<P N="5">5. FOR &s;inners to be directed to any thing &s;hort of repentance toward GOD, and faith toward our Lord JESUS CHRIST; or any thing to be done, or duty to be performed, any otherwi&s;e than in the exerci&s;e of a hum|ble, penitent and broken heart; evidently encourageth his vain confidence, and manife&s;tly implieth that his <HI>impotency</HI> affords him &s;ome degree of rea&s;onable excu&s;e. <HI>Paul</HI> con&s;iders all mankind as being <HI>without excu&s;e</HI> for not glorifying GOD as GOD. <HI>He</HI> &s;aith, that <HI>the invi&s;ible things of Him, from the creation of the world, are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead</HI>; &s;o that they are without ex|cu&s;e. Rom. i. 20. <HI>Paul</HI> was, by no means, unacquaint|ed with the impotency of human nature, and, no man was more deeply and effectually convinced of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;pecial, divine and almighty power, in order to bring &s;inners to repent and believe the go&s;pel; and yet we find that <HI>he</HI> con&s;iders even the heathen them&s;elves as being <HI>without excu&s;e</HI> in their oppo&s;ition to GOD. Ac|cordingly, in <HI>his</HI> preaching, we find no directions to any thing &s;hort of real hatred to &s;in, and love to CHRIST; or, which can be complied with, without the exerci&s;e of &s;upreme love to GOD.</P>

And, when any doings or performances &s;hort of repenting and believing, are directed to <HI>as the appointed way and means of obtaining God's favor</HI>; the direction naturally dimin|i&s;heth the importance of repentence and faith; and makes the &s;inner le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the obligation and ne|ce&s;&s;ity of true, cordial &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to a &s;overeign GOD.</P>
<P>FOR a &s;inner to be advi&s;ed and directed to any thing, as a means of obtaining GOD's favour, or converting grace, or any thing with which the favour of GOD is connected, &s;hort of a hearty turning from &s;in to GOD; will naturally give him to think that he is excu&s;ed from the obligation of immediate repentance and turning unto GOD: He mu&s;t, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;urely, think him|&s;elf excu&s;ed from the obligation of repenting, <HI>until</HI> he has done &s;omething el&s;e, And, when, or where &s;uch directions will land him upon the duty of <HI>immediate re|pentance,</HI> is extremely uncertain.

Nothing can more di|rectly tend to keep the true and real character, both of the DEITY, and of the &s;inner, out of view, than &s;uch kind of directions and exhortations as the&s;e.

Thus is the grace of GOD made an excu&s;e for continuing in &s;in.
