<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is the happine&s;s of people who live in a free government, that they may upon every occa|&s;ion, when they conceive their rights in danger, from whatever cau&s;e, meet, con&s;ult and delibe|rate upon the proper mode of relief, and addre&s;s their fellow citizens; pointing out the dangers which they apprehend, and inviting them to con|cur in mea&s;ures for their removal.</P>
<P>In the exerci&s;e of this privilege, a number of the free citizens of New-York did a&s;&s;emble, and having appointed us their committee, gave it in charge to us to addre&s;s you on the &s;ubject of a late deci&s;ion of the Mayor's court, in this city, on the law commonly called the Tre&s;pa&s;s Law, in a ca&s;e brought to i&s;&s;ue in that court between Rutgers and Wuddington.</P>
<P>This action was founded on a law of this &s;tate,
<PB N="3" REF="018320_0003_0FA5D4712EE055F0">
entitled, 'An act for granting more effectual re|lief in ca&s;es of certain Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es,' pa&s;&s;ed in March, 1783; by which it is declared, that it &s;hall and may be lawful for any per&s;on or per|&s;ons who are or were inhabitants of this &s;tate, and who by rea&s;on of the inva&s;ion of the enemy, left his, her or their place or places of abode, and who have not voluntarily put them&s;elves re|&s;pectively in the power of the enemy &s;ince they &s;o left their places of abode, &amp;c. to bring an action of tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t any per&s;on or per&s;ons who may have occupied, injured, or de&s;troyed, his, her or their e&s;tate, either real or per&s;onal within the power of the enemy. And that no defendant or defendants &s;hall be admitted to plead in ju&s;tification any military order or com|mand what&s;oever for &s;uch occupancy.</P>
<P>The plaintiff charged the defendant for the u&s;e and occupancy of a certain brew-hou&s;e and malt-hou&s;e, in the city of New-York, the pro|perty of the plaintiff.</P>
<P>To this charge the defendant plead, that the premi&s;es in que&s;tion were occupied part of the time under the Briti&s;h army, who took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion thereof by virtue of permi&s;&s;ion from the commander in chief of &s;aid army, and the re|mainder of the time by virtue of licen&s;e and per|mi&s;&s;ion granted by the &s;aid commander in chief to a certain per&s;on, under whom the defendant held; which licen&s;es and permi&s;&s;ions the &s;aid commander had authority to give by the law of nations.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="018320_0004_0FA5D471DDF3DCA8">The defendant further plead, that by the trea|ty of peace, all right, claim, &amp;c. which either of the contracting parties, and the &s;ubjects and citizens of either of them might otherwi&s;e have to any compen&s;ation, &amp;c. what&s;oever, for, or by rea&s;on of any injury or damage, whether to the public or individuals which either of the &s;aid contracting parties, and the &s;ubjects or citizens of either, might have done, or cau&s;ed to be done to the other, in con&s;equence of, or in any wi&s;e relating to the war between them, from the commencement to the determination thereof, were mutually and reciprocally, virtually and effectually relinqui&s;hed, renounced and relea&s;ed to each other; and further averred, that the de|fendant was, from the time of his birth, and at all times &s;ince hath been, a Briti&s;h &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The plaintiff to the fir&s;t plea of the defend|ant, namely, that the premi&s;es were held by vir|tue of authority and permi&s;&s;ion from the com|mander in chief of the Briti&s;h army, replied, that &s;he ought not to be barred of her action by rea|&s;on of that plea; becau&s;e the law under which &s;he brought her &s;uit did expre&s;sly declare, that no defendant or defendants &s;hould be admitted to plead any military order or command what|&s;oever for the occupancy.</P>
<P>As to the further plea of the defendant, name|ly, the treaty of peace, the plaintiff demurred, or denied its &s;ufficiency in the law.</P>
<P>This cau&s;e, as above &s;tated, was argued on the 29th of June pa&s;t, before the Mayor's court,
<PB N="5" REF="018320_0005_0FA5D47296A08E88">
and on the 27th of Augu&s;t judgment was given.</P>
<P>The two points which pre&s;ented for the court's determination upon, ari&s;ing from the two pleas of the defendant, were,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Whether permi&s;&s;ion and authority from the commander in chief of the Briti&s;h army, a|greeably to the law of nations, was a &s;ufficient ju&s;tification to the defendant for the u&s;e and oc|cupancy of the premi&s;es in que&s;tion; notwith|&s;tanding the act of the legi&s;lature declares, 'that no defendant or defendants &s;hall be ad|mitted to plead in ju&s;tification any military or|der or command what&s;oever.'</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Whether the treaty of peace includes in it &s;uch an indemnity as to ju&s;tify the defend|ant for his u&s;e of the premi&s;es.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t point, the judgment of the court was, that the plea of the defendant was good for &s;o much of the time as he held the premi&s;es under the immediate authority of the Briti&s;h commander in chief; or in other words, notwith&s;tanding the law declares that no defendant &s;hall be allowed to plead in ju&s;tifica|tion any military order or command what&s;oever, yet the authority and permi&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h commander in chief &s;hall be deemed a &s;ufficient ju&s;tification; becau&s;e in the opinion of the court a liberal con&s;truction of the law of nations would make it &s;o, and becau&s;e the court could not believe that a repeal of, or an interference with the law of nations entered into the &s;cheme of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="018320_0006_0FA5D4750E1D72F8">The &s;econd plea, namely, the Treaty of Peace, the Court declared in&s;ufficient.</P>
<P>From this &s;tate of the ca&s;e it appears, that the Mayor's Court have a&s;&s;umed and exerci&s;ed a power to &s;et a&s;ide an act of the &s;tate. That it has permitted the <HI>vague and doubtful</HI> cu&s;tom of nations to be plead again&s;t, and to render abortive, a <HI>clear and po&s;itive</HI> &s;tatute; and mi|litary authority of the enemy to be plead again&s;t the expre&s;s prohibition of our legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>This proceeding, in the opinion of a great part of the citizens of this metropolis, and in our opinion, is an a&s;&s;umption of power in that Court, which is incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature and genius of our government, and threatening to the liberties of the people.</P>
<P>We think the controver&s;y, notwith&s;tanding the immen&s;e learning and abilities which we are told have been di&s;played in it, lies within a nar|row compa&s;s, and within the reach of every common under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>It is reducible to the two following que&s;tions, Does the plain and obvious meaning of the &s;ta|tute prohibit the pleading of any military or|ders, commands, permi&s;&s;ion and authority of the enemy in ju&s;tification of any tre&s;pa&s;s for which a &s;uit can be brought under it?</P>
<P>Can a Court of Judicature, con&s;i&s;tently with our con&s;titution and laws, adjudge contrary to the plain and obvious meaning of a &s;tatute?</P>
<P>If the&s;e que&s;tions are an&s;wered in the nega|tive, authorities from Grotius, Puffendorff,
<PB N="7" REF="018320_0007_0FA5D4768DC48558">
Wol&s;ius, Burlamaqui, Vattel, or any other Ci|vilians, are no more to the purpo&s;e than &s;o ma|ny opinions drawn from &s;ages of the Six Nati|ons.</P>
<P>If they are an&s;wered in the affirmative, then there can be no di&s;puting again&s;t the opinion of the Court.</P>
<P>With regard to the meaning and intention of the Legi&s;lature, it may be inferred from the very enacting of the law; for in doing that they &s;uppo&s;e that as laws before &s;tood, actions could not lie in ca&s;es of this nature; to remedy this, they make it lawful for per&s;ons de&s;cribed in the act, to bring actions of tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t, &amp;c. and declare that no military authority what&s;oever of the enemy &s;hall be plead, or evidenced in ju&s;|tification of the tre&s;pa&s;s.</P>
<P>No point of controver&s;y can ari&s;e on the ca&s;e but mu&s;t turn upon the propriety or impropri|ety of the law it&s;elf; not upon its con&s;truction. For the plain language of the law is this, that the military power of Great-Britain, by taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e e&s;tates, and giving authority, permi&s;&s;ion, order or command to per&s;ons for oc|cupying and improving them, &s;hould not ex|cu&s;e the occupier from being con&s;idered as a tre&s;pa&s;&s;er, and thereby not liable to pay da|mages to the owner. We can hardly conceive it po&s;&s;ible for the legi&s;lature to have cho&s;en words that would make the intention of their law more clear.</P>
<P>If what we have &s;tated be not the true mean|ing
<PB N="8" REF="018320_0008_0FA5D47771001140">
of the law, then we conceive that it has no meaning.</P>
<P>The time of pa&s;&s;ing the law, and the evident grounds of it, &s;how the intention of the legi&s;la|ture, and put it beyond a doubt that the &s;pirit and literal con&s;truction of it are the &s;ame. To give a remedy to tho&s;e citizens who had aban|doned their e&s;tates on the approach of the ene|my, and who had adhered to the fortunes of their country in all its vici&s;&s;itudes; mo&s;t of whom had &s;uffered very great lo&s;s of per&s;onal property, and many of them reduced from af|fluence to penury and want. The real e&s;tates which they owned in the Southern di&s;trict, it was well known, had been greatly injured; mo&s;t of them irreparably &s;o.</P>
<P>We were then at the clo&s;e of the war. The legi&s;lature had certain accounts that the preli|minary articles of peace were &s;igned. The time was con&s;idered as ju&s;t at hand, when the exiles, the greater part of whom had expended all their loo&s;e property, were to be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their real e&s;tates, from which they had &s;uffered voluntary bani&s;hment for more than &s;even years. The bad condition of their e&s;tates, and their incapacity to improve them, made the ca&s;e, which the legi&s;lature thought proper to afford relief in by the law.</P>
<P>It is well known that mo&s;t of the&s;e e&s;tates were at that time held, or pretended to be held by virtue of authority from the Briti&s;h Com|mander in Chief. The law of nations was the
<PB N="9" REF="018320_0009_0FA5D477D5648060">
&s;ame then as at this time, and the immutable principles of ju&s;tice have not changed. Yet the wi&s;dom and &s;upreme authority of the &s;tate did declare that no military order or command of the enemy &s;hould be plead, or given in evidence. The law being thus plain and explicit, it was never apprehended that its operation would be defeated by the plea of authority from the ene|my</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with a belief of its compleat and entire operation, many of the per&s;ons them|&s;elves who held the e&s;tates of exiles under the Briti&s;h, abandoned the place with them to a|void paying the damages which would accrue from it.</P>
<P>The gentlemen of the law, we are confident, almo&s;t univer&s;ally con&s;idered it as expre&s;&s;ed in plain and unequivocal language that could not be mi&s;under&s;tood or explained away. In &s;hort, no doubt was entertained of the meaning of the law, until the ca&s;e of <HI>Rutgers</HI> and <HI>Waddington</HI> was agitated, and then there was no way left for the Defendant to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, but by in|venting di&s;tinctions where there was no differ|ence, and introducing matter which the law prohibited.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, we think that no one can doubt of the meaning of the law. It remains to enquire, Whether a Court of Judi|cature can con&s;i&s;tently, with our con&s;titution and laws, adjudge contrary to the plain and ob|vious meaning of a &s;tatute.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="018320_0010_0FA5D4789F511700">That the Mayor's Court have done &s;o in this ca&s;e, we think is manife&s;t from the foregoing remarks.</P>
<P>That there &s;hould be a power ve&s;ted in courts of judicature, whereby they might controul the &s;upreme legi&s;lative power we think is ab&s;urd in it&s;elf. Such power in courts would be de&s;truc|tive of liberty, and remove all &s;ecurity of pro|perty. The de&s;ign of courts of ju&s;tice in our government, from the very nature of their in&s;ti|tution, is to declare laws, not to alter them.</P>
<P>Whenever they depart from this de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, they confound legi&s;lative and judicial powers.</P>
<P>The laws govern where a government is free, and every citizen knows what remedy the laws give him, for every injury. But this cannot be the ca&s;e, where Courts, if they deem a law to be unrea&s;onable, may &s;et it a&s;ide.</P>
<P>Here, however plainly the law may be in his favour, he cannot be certain of redre&s;s, until he has the opinion of the Court.</P>
<P>It may be <HI>expre&s;&s;ed generally,</HI> and only &s;ay, that all per&s;ons in certain circum&s;tances &s;hall recover in certain ca&s;es. But it may not by name bar every objection that might po&s;&s;ibly be argued again&s;t it, where intere&s;t and incli|nation hold invention upon the rack.</P>
<P>It may not particularly de&s;cribe the man, &s;ay what country he is to &s;pring from, or what his occupation is to be, and being thus <HI>gener|ally expre&s;&s;ed,</HI> it cannot be from the nature of
<PB N="11" REF="018320_0011_0FA5D47B82509EF0">
things, but it will admit of &s;ome exceptions, and as it may admit of &s;ome exceptions, it mu&s;t receive a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> and liberal interpretation from the Court, <HI>however arduous the ta&s;k may be.</HI> Now the rea&s;oning of the Court and the rea&s;oning of the legi&s;lature may lead them to very different conclu&s;ions, and as the Court rea|&s;on la&s;t upon the ca&s;e, it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible for any man to gue&s;s when he brings a &s;uit, however exactly it may apply to the law, un|til by a tedious and expen&s;ive proce&s;s, he obtains the opinion of the Court whether he &s;hall re|cover or not.</P>
<P>It is not our intention to enter into a particu|lar con&s;ideration of the evils which would re&s;ult from the exerci&s;e of &s;uch a power in our courts; much le&s;s to con&s;ider all the arguments u&s;ed to vindicate the deci&s;ion in the ca&s;e of Rutgers and Waddington. We are addre&s;&s;ing an enlight|ened people, who are awake to every thing that may affect their dearly attained freedom; who know that the con&s;equences which would flow from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch a power, would be of the mo&s;t &s;erious and pernicious kind; ren|dering abortive the fir&s;t and great privilege of freemen, the privilege of making their own laws by their repre&s;entatives. For if the pow|er of abrogating or altering them be a&s;&s;umed by our courts, and &s;ubmitted to by the people, then, as far as liberty and the &s;ecurity of pro|perty are concerned, they become as u&s;ele&s;s as
<PB N="12" REF="018320_0012_0FA5D47BA5D24FE0">
other opinions which are not precedents, and from which judges may vary.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that the principal judges are in mo&s;t ca&s;es appointed to act within the li|mits of a certain age, or during good behaviour, We do not wi&s;h to le&s;&s;en their independency;&mdash; for while they are content to move in their pro|per &s;phere, while they &s;peak the plain and ob|vious meaning of the law, and do not pre&s;ume to alter it, or explain it to mean any thing or nothing. While in the duties of their real pro|vince they cannot be too independent; nor ought they to be liable to a remove but for mi&s;beha|viour. But if they are to be inve&s;ted with a power to over-rule a plain law, tho' expre&s;&s;ed in <HI>general words,</HI> as all general laws are and mu&s;t be. When they may judge the law unrea&s;ona|ble, becau&s;e not con&s;onant to the law of nations, or to the opinions of antient or modern civilians and philo&s;ophers, for whom they may have a greater veneration than for the &s;olid &s;tatutes and &s;upreme legi&s;lative power of the &s;tate. We &s;ay, if they are to a&s;&s;ume and exerci&s;e &s;uch a power, the probable con&s;equence of their independence will be, the mo&s;t deplorable and wretched de|pendency of the people.</P>
<P>That the laws &s;hould be no longer ab&s;olute, would be in it&s;elf a great evil; but a far more dreadful con&s;equence ari&s;es; for that power is not lo&s;t in the controver&s;y, but transferred to judges who are independent of the people.</P>
<P>The&s;e being our apprehen&s;ions, we have, in
<PB N="13" REF="018320_0013_0FA5D47C6F1B5768">
compliance with the reque&s;t of our fellow-citi|zens, and from a conviction of its propriety, briefly &s;tated to you our ideas on this important affair.</P>
<P>In a free government people &s;hould be inform|ed of the conduct of their rulers and magi&s;trates. It is a knowledge that is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;erving of their freedom.</P>
<P>Power pre&s;ents &s;o many charms to mankind, that there are very few indeed, even of the be&s;t of men who have their avarice and ambition &s;o perfectly under the correction of virtue and true wi&s;dom, as not to feel an inclination to &s;urmount the limits a&s;&s;igned them; e&s;pecially, when the additional temptation of ignorance or inatten|tion on the &s;ide of the people prompt to it.</P>
<P>A private and individual ca&s;e would not ju&s;|tify the mea&s;ures which we have taken. But we con&s;ider the deci&s;ion in the ca&s;e of Rutgers and Waddington as an adjudication which may be drawn into precedent, and eventually affect every citizen of this &s;tate. It therefore merits the attention of us all.</P>
<P>To prevent this mi&s;chief, we do not advi&s;e our fellow-citizens to mea&s;ures which are uncon|&s;titutional; nor do we mean to u&s;e them our|&s;elves. The mode of redre&s;s which our excel|lent con&s;titution points out is, Fir&s;t, by an ap|peal to the &s;upreme court, where this cau&s;e will be carried by Writ of Error. We feel a con|fidence from the characters of the gentlemen who pre&s;ide in that court, that the law will have
<PB N="14" REF="018320_0014_0FA5D47D47F25510">
its operation re&s;tored in its plain and obvious meaning. But if we &s;hould be di&s;appointed, the cau&s;e is of too much con&s;equence to re&s;t here. Its importance will grow with the difficulties and defeats it may meet with; for each of the&s;e will make a new di&s;covery of the &s;trength of its opponents; each defeat will create a new triumph over freedom, and give additional courage and importance to her adver&s;aries, and all call upon us the more earne&s;tly to &s;upport that cau&s;e, to defend that ground upon which the &s;tandard of liberty is erected, and which, if ever &s;urrender|ed, we &s;hould be prepared to &s;urrender with it every le&s;s and con&s;equent privilege, whereby we might be allowed better terms, from de&s;po|ti&s;m, than we &s;hould by di&s;covering our wretch|edne&s;s and imbecility in a conte&s;t which the fir&s;t defeat will have rendered vain and hopele&s;s.</P>
<P>The next mode pointed out by the con&s;titu|tion, is an appeal to the court of Errors, one part of which the Senate con&s;titute. Prepara|tory to &s;uch an event, we exhort you to be cau|tious in your future choice of members, that none be elected but tho&s;e on whom, from long and certain experience you can rely, as men at|tached to the liberties of America, and firm friends to our law and con&s;titution. Men who will &s;purn at any propo&s;ition that has a ten|dency to curtail the privileges of the people, and who at the &s;ame time, that they protect us again&s;t judicial tyranny, have wi&s;dom to &s;ee the propriety of &s;upporting that nece&s;&s;ary indepen|dency
<PB N="15" REF="018320_0015_0FA5D47DEFF55BE8">
in courts of ju&s;tice, both of the legi&s;lature and people, without which the fear of di&s;mi&s;&s;i|on from office on the one hand, and of per&s;on|al violence on the other, might &s;teal into their deci&s;ions, and render them intere&s;ted and cor|rupt.</P>
<P>Having confined our&s;elves to con&s;titutional mea&s;ures, and now &s;olemnly declaring our di&s;|approbation of all others, and having &s;olely for our object, the &s;upport of our excellent con&s;ti|tution, and the ab&s;olute and entire operation of our laws, we feel a freedom in &s;ounding the alarm to our fellow citizens.</P>
<P>If that Independence and freedom which we have obtained at a ri&s;que which makes the ac|qui&s;ition little le&s;s than miraculous, was worth contending for again&s;t a powerful and enraged Monarch, and at the expence of the be&s;t blood in America, &s;urely its pre&s;ervation is worth con|tending for again&s;t tho&s;e among our&s;elves, who might impiou&s;ly hope to build their greatne&s;s upon the ruins of that fabric which was &s;o dear|ly e&s;tabli&s;hed?</P>
<P>That the principle of deci&s;ion in the ca&s;e of <HI>Rutgers</HI> and <HI>Waddington</HI> is dangerous to the freedom of our government, and that a per&s;e|verance in that principle would leave our Le|gi&s;lature nothing but a name, and render their &s;e&s;&s;ions nothing more than an expen&s;ive form of government, the preceding remarks mu&s;t evi|dence.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="018320_0016_0FA5D47E9E4E8798">Permit us, upon this occa&s;ion, earne&s;tly to intreat you, to join us in a watchfulne&s;s again&s;t every attempt that may be u&s;ed, either violent|ly and &s;uddenly, or gently and impercepti|bly, to effect a revolution in the &s;pirit and ge+nius of our government; and &s;hould there be-among&s;t us, characters to whom the &s;implici|ty of it is offen&s;ive; let our attention and per&s;e|verance be &s;uch, as to preclude the hopes of a change. For even if our government was le&s;s excellent than it is, it would be better for us to be reconciled to a few inconveniencies, than by a ha&s;ty and ill-judged revolution, to put to the hazard all that we now enjoy under the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Frequent changes or even alterations in go|vernment, where the people have &s;o lately come to the exerci&s;e of one, may produce an in&s;tabi|lity in them that will be more di&s;agreeable than trifling inconveniencies in the one already e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
