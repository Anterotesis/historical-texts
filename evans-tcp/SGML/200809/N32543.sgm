THOUGH it may be alledged, that a great deal of <HI>ge&s;|ture</HI> or <HI>action</HI> at the bar, or in the pulpit, e&s;pecially in the latter, is not wanted, nor is quite in character; yet mo&s;t certain it is, that there is no part of a man that has not its proper <HI>attitude.</HI> The <HI>eyes</HI> are not to be rolled along the cieling, as if the &s;peaker were taking care how the flies behave them&s;elves. Nor are they to be con|t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">antly ca&s;t down upon the ground, as if he were before his judge, receiving &s;entence of <HI>death.</HI> Nor are they to be fixed upon <HI>one point,</HI> as if he &s;aw a <HI>gho&s;t.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>arms</HI> of a preacher are not to be needle&s;sly thrown out, as if he were drowning in the pulpit; or brandi&s;hed after the manner of the ancient boxers, when they fought with their own &s;hadows, to prepare them&s;elves for the olimpic conte&s;ts. Nor on the contrary are his <HI>hands</HI> to be <HI>pocketed up,</HI> nor his <HI>arms</HI> to hang by his &s;ides, as if they were both <HI>withered.</HI> The <HI>head</HI> is not to &s;tand fixed, as if the preacher had a crick in his neck; nor is it to nod at every third word, as if he were acting Jupiter.</P>
<P>A JUDICIOUS &s;peaker is ma&s;ter of &s;uch a <HI>variety</HI> of decent and natural <HI>motions,</HI> and has &s;uch a command of attitude, that he will not be long enough in any <HI>one po&s;|ture</HI> to offend the eye of the &s;pectator. The matter he has to pronounce, will ea&s;ily &s;ugge&s;t to him the propriety of changing his <HI>look,</HI> his <HI>po&s;ture,</HI> his <HI>motion</HI> and tone of voice, which if they were to continue too long, would become di&s;agreeable to the beholders. But yet, he is not to be every moment changing po&s;ture like a harle|quin, nor throwing his hands about, as if he were &s;hew|ing legerdemain tricks. And above all things, the public &s;peaker is never to forget the great rule, ARS EST CELARE ARTEM. It would be infinitely more plea&s;ing, to &s;ee him deliver him&s;elf with as little motion as an Egyptian <HI>mummy,</HI> than di&s;torting him&s;elf into all the violations of

<HI>decorum,</HI> which affectation produces; for art, &s;een through, is <HI>execrable.</HI> Mode&s;ty ought ever to be con&s;picuous in the behaviour of all, who exhibit them&s;elves before the <HI>public.</HI> Whatever of ge&s;ture or exertion of voice &s;uch per&s;ons u&s;e, they ought apparently to be <HI>drawn</HI> into them, by the <HI>importance,</HI> &s;pirit or humour of the matter. For if the &s;peaker u&s;es any arts of delivery which appear plainly to be &s;tudied, and unnatural, the effect will be, that his aukward and vain attempt to work upon the pa&s;&s;ions of his hearers by means, of which he is not <HI>ma&s;ter,</HI> will render him odious and contemptible to them.&mdash;With what <HI>&s;tiff</HI> and <HI>pedantic &s;olemnity</HI> do &s;ome public &s;peakers utter thoughts &s;o trifling, as to be hardly worth uttering at all? And what unnatural and un&s;uitable tones of voice and ge&s;tures do others apply, in deliver|ing what, by their manner of delivering, one would be apt to que&s;tion, not only whether it is their own compo|&s;ition, but whether they under&s;tand it?&mdash;Nor is it to be expected, that <HI>decorum</HI> of <HI>manner</HI> in preaching can ever be carried to any great perfection, while <HI>reading</HI> is thought to be <HI>preaching</HI>

orators had <HI>read</HI> their &s;ermons, the effect would have been pretty much the &s;ame, as that which the <HI>reading</HI> of &s;ermons produces among us.

The more is the <HI>pity.</HI> And it ought to be often made again and again, until the fault be mended.&mdash;Did preachers labour to acquire a <HI>ma&s;terly delivery,</HI> places of <HI>public in&s;truction</HI> would be as crowded as places of public diver&s;ion. <HI>Rakes</HI> and <HI>infidels,</HI> merely to &s;hew their <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> would frequent them. Could <HI>all</HI> frequent them, and <HI>none</HI> profit? It is common to hear complaints from our clergy, of the <HI>inattention</HI> of their hearers, even to dozing, and &s;ome|times profound &s;leep. But where does this complaint fall at la&s;t? Even upon the preachers them&s;elves, who addre&s;s their hearers with &s;o much coolne&s;s and infiffer|ence, as leaves them nothing to do but <HI>to go to &s;leep.</HI> Let the preacher be but &s;uitably animated, and exert him|&s;elf, and he may de&s;y his hearers to &s;leep, or withdraw their attention for a moment.</P>
<P>THE clergy are likewi&s;e full of their complaints, of the little effect their labours produce.&mdash;Infidelity and vice, they &s;ay, prevail more than ever. But what is the plain Engli&s;h of this complaint? Why are churches &s;o poorly filled? Why is it that tho&s;e who attend, per|haps do it only for fa&s;hion's &s;ake, and are not much better than their neighbours? Why, truly, the clergy
<PB N="8" REF="042813_0007_101C95D09D92B1A8">
find people loath to go to places of public in&s;truction, to be di&s;gu&s;ted, or lulled to &s;leep. And when they have them there, they cannot per&s;uade them to quit their vices and follies, by lolling thirty or forty, or per|haps but twenty minutes, upon a <HI>velvet cu&s;hion</HI>; and only <HI>reading</HI> to them a learned di&s;cour&s;e.&mdash;They cannot <HI>warm</HI> them to the love of virtue, by a <HI>cold, ill|read pulpit harangue.</HI> They cannot win their <HI>affections,</HI> while they neglect all the natural means for working upon the <HI>human pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> They cannot kindle in them that burning zeal, which is nece&s;&s;ary for the mo&s;t important of all intere&s;ts, by talking or rather reading only, with the coolne&s;s of a &s;ett of <HI>&s;toic philo&s;ophers,</HI> con|cerning <HI>the terrors of the Lord,</HI> of <HI>the worm that dies not,</HI> of future glory, honour and immortality, of everla&s;ting kingdoms, and heavenly thrones.&mdash;It is common for preachers to plead their mode&s;ty, and fear of being ac|cu&s;ed of affectation, in excu&s;e of the <HI>dulne&s;s</HI> and the <HI>coldne&s;s</HI> of their manner of addre&s;&s;ing their hearers. But are tho&s;e any hinderance to the elocution of the <HI>actors,</HI> or even the actre&s;&s;es, who by &s;tudy and practice get the better of fear, and attain an <HI>elegant</HI> and correct utterance, and are indeed almo&s;t the only &s;peakers we have without appearance of <HI>affectation</HI>? But do our preachers in general be&s;tow any thought, or u&s;e any means of any kind, for improving them&s;elves in &s;peak|ing? The younger part of the players rehear&s;e and prac|ti&s;e over and over many times, and are long under the tuition of the principal actors, before they appear in public. But there are perhaps no other public &s;peak|ers among us, who take &s;uch pains; though they be|&s;tow great pains in improving them&s;elves in learning; and yet of the two <HI>learning</HI> is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to a preacher, than &s;kill in <HI>per&s;uading.</HI> Let the reader only con|&s;ider,
<PB N="9" REF="042813_0008_101C95D5C9A8BB88">
that a mechanic is under a ma&s;ter <HI>&s;even years</HI> at lea&s;t, before he &s;ets up for him&s;elf. But the preacher goes into the pulpit <HI>at once,</HI> without ever having had <HI>one le&s;&s;on</HI> of in&s;truction in that part of his art which is the chief and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, and without which all his other accompli&s;hments are worth nothing, toward gain|ing the great end of preaching.&mdash;It may be alledged, and it often has been alledged, by the clergy, that they cannot be expected to be great orators for fifty or an hundred pounds a year. The an&s;wer is ready, are there not many players who do not get more than the lower clergy? and yet they &s;tudy <HI>hard,</HI> and take great pains, for no greater gain or encouragement, and do actually acquire &s;uch &s;kill in &s;peaking and performing, that for my part, if I de&s;ired to have a compo&s;ition of mine <HI>well &s;poken,</HI> I would put it into the hands even of a &s;econd|rate &s;tage-player, rather than of almo&s;t any preacher I ever heard.&mdash;What could be imagined more <HI>elegant,</HI> if entertainment alone were &s;ought? What more <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> if the <HI>everla&s;ting good of mankind</HI> were the object, than the &s;acred office of <HI>preaching properly performed?</HI> Were the mo&s;t <HI>intere&s;ting</HI> of &s;ubjects treated with proper <HI>per&s;pi|cuity,</HI> and adequate <HI>judgment,</HI> and <HI>well-compo&s;ed di&s;cour&s;es</HI> delivered to the li&s;tening crowds, with that <HI>dignity</HI> which becomes a teacher of <HI>divine truth,</HI> and with that <HI>energy</HI> and <HI>pathos,</HI> which would &s;hew that the preacher &s;poke from his <HI>own heart,</HI> and really meant to &s;peak to the <HI>hearts</HI> of his hearers, &s;hould we not &s;oon &s;ee the good effects of &s;uch preaching? For mankind are not wood or &s;tone. They may be <HI>drawn.</HI> They may be <HI>allured.</HI> They may be <HI>rou&s;ed</HI> and <HI>&s;tartled.</HI> The voice of an able and well-accompli&s;hed preacher, thundering out the <HI>di|vine threatnings</HI> again&s;t <HI>vice,</HI> would be in the ear of the of|fender as if he heard the &s;ound of the <HI>la&s;t trumpet,</HI> &s;um|moning
<PB N="10" REF="042813_0009_101C95DB90EAF690">
the dead to judgement. And <HI>the gentle call of mercy,</HI> encouraging the terrified and almo&s;t de&s;pairing <HI>penitent</HI> to look up to his offended heavenly <HI>father,</HI> would be as <HI>the &s;ong of angels.</HI>&mdash;A whole multitude might as it were be lifted to the <HI>&s;kies,</HI> and the world of <HI>&s;pirits</HI> be opened to the eyes of their minds.&mdash;The <HI>terrors</HI> of that puni&s;hment which awaits <HI>vice</HI>; the <HI>glories</HI> of that &s;tate to which virtue and true piety, through <HI>divine grace,</HI> will rai&s;e the pious, might be, by a powerful preacher, rendered pre&s;ent to their under&s;tandings, with &s;uch conviction, as would make indelible impre&s;&s;ions upon the hearts of the hearers, and work a &s;ub&s;tantial re|formation in their lives. The convincing and irrefragable <HI>proof,</HI> that real and important effects might he produced by preachers, by a proper u&s;e of <HI>oratory,</HI> to the good purpo&s;es of in&s;tructing and amending mankind, is, that <HI>oratory,</HI> in all times, has been known actually to pro|duce great alterations in mens ways of thinking and act|ing. And there is no denying plain facts. No one can imagine that <HI>oratory</HI> could have been &s;o laboriou&s;ly cultivated by <HI>&s;tate&s;men,</HI> in all free and flouri&s;hing govern|ments, had they not found it u&s;eful to the &s;tate. But if any one &s;hould alledge that there is nothing in the power of <HI>preachers</HI> by means of <HI>oratory,</HI> I would a&s;k, does it not then follow, that the whole office of preaching may as well be laid a&s;ide? For if <HI>good &s;peaking</HI> will have no effect, &s;urely <HI>bad</HI> will have none. A <HI>Perecles,</HI> or a <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> could <HI>&s;hake</HI> all Greece, when they warned their coun|trymen again&s;t an <HI>inva&s;ion,</HI> or alarmed them about the danger of their liberties, whil&s;t our preachers can hardly keep their hearers <HI>awake,</HI> when they &s;tand forth in the <HI>name of God,</HI> to warn them again&s;t the con&s;equences of <HI>vice,</HI> &s;o ruinous to individuals, &s;o ruinous to nations; the cau&s;e not only of the &s;ubver&s;ion of &s;tates and kingdoms, when luxury and corruption &s;pread their fatal contagion, 
<PB N="11" REF="042813_0010_101C95DD18229E90">
and leave a people the unthinking prey of <HI>tyranny</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> but of utter and irretrievable de&s;truction, from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and the glory of his power, when the trumpet &s;hall &s;ound, and the dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed, and he &s;hall &s;it upon the throne of judgment, from who&s;e face heaven and earth &s;hall flee away.</P>
<P>IT may perhaps be objected, that <HI>&s;acred truth</HI> needs no <HI>ornament</HI> to &s;et it off, nor <HI>art</HI> to enforce it: That the <HI>apo&s;tles were artle&s;s and illiterate men,</HI> and yet they gain|ed the great end of their mi&s;&s;ion, the conviction of mul|titudes, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity: And that therefore there is no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch attention to deli|very, in order to qualify the preacher for his &s;acred of|fice, or to render his labours &s;ucce&s;sful.&mdash;To all this an an&s;wer it ready.&mdash;The apo&s;tles were not <HI>all</HI> artle&s;s and illiterate men. St. <HI>Paul,</HI> the greate&s;t and mo&s;t ge|neral propagator of Chri&s;tianity, is an eminent exception. He could be no mean orator who confounded the Jews at Dama&s;cus; made a <HI>Prince,</HI> before whom he &s;tood to be judged, confe&s;s that he had almo&s;t per&s;uaded him to become a convert to a religion every where &s;poken again&s;t; threw another into a fit of trembling, as he &s;at upon his judgment &s;eat; made &s;uch a defence before the learned court of <HI>Areopagus,</HI> as gained him for a convert, who was a member of the court it&s;elf; &s;truck a whole people with &s;uch admiration, that they took him for <HI>the God of eloquence</HI>; and gained him a place in <HI>Longinus</HI>'s li&s;t of <HI>famous orators.</HI> Would <HI>the cold mono|tony</HI> of our Engli&s;h <HI>&s;ermon-readers</HI> have produced &s;uch effects as the&s;e? Surely it would not.</P>
<P>BUT farther it may be added, the apo&s;tles might very well &s;pare human accompli&s;hments, having what was worth 
<PB N="12" REF="042813_0011_101C95DEC8D53718">
them all, the divine gift of working <HI>miracles,</HI> which if our preachers had, we &s;hould not have much to &s;ay about their qualifying them&s;elves in <HI>elocution.</HI> But, as it is, pub|lic in&s;truction is the preacher's <HI>weapon,</HI> with which he is to combat <HI>infidelity</HI> and <HI>vice.</HI> But what avails a weapon without <HI>&s;kill</HI> to weild it? Therefore the preacher ought, above all other public &s;peakers, to labour to enrich and adorn, in the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> ma&s;terly manner, his addre&s;&s;es to man|kind, his views, if as they ought to be, being the mo&s;t important.</P>
<P>WHAT grand point has the <HI>player</HI> to gain? Why, to draw an audience to the <HI>theatre.</HI> The pleader at the bar, if he lays before the judges and jury the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e, &s;o as they may be mo&s;t likely to &s;ee where the right of it lies, has done his duty. The &s;peaker in either hou&s;e of Parliament has only to con&s;ider that the good of his country may in a great mea&s;ure depend upon his tongue. But the infinitely important &s;ubject of preaching is <HI>the reformation of mankind,</HI> upon which de|pends their happine&s;s in this world, and throughout the whole of their being. Of how great importance is it then, that the art of preaching be carried to &s;uch perfec|tion, that all may be drawn to places of public in&s;truc|tion, and that tho&s;e who attend them may receive bene|fit! And if almo&s;t the whole of preaching, to any good effect, depends upon delivery, how nece&s;&s;ary is the &s;tu|dy of delivery! That a good and lively delivery is in|comparably the mo&s;t important part of public in&s;truction, is plainly manife&s;t from this, <HI>that very indifferent matter, well delivered,</HI> will make a con&s;iderable <HI>impre&s;&s;ion.</HI> But <HI>bad utterance</HI> will defeat the whole <HI>effect</HI> of <HI>the noble&s;t</HI> compo&s;ition that ever was produced.

with alluring &s;ollicitation, without, invite and en&s;nare the frail and thoughtle&s;s into guilt; &s;hall <HI>virtue and religion,</HI> preached from the pulpit, hold forth <HI>no charms</HI> to engage votaries? <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> decks her&s;elf out with <HI>rich attire,</HI> and mu&s;t <HI>Religion</HI> pre&s;ent her&s;elf with every di&s;advantage, and mu&s;t &s;he appear quite unadorn|ed? What chance can &s;he then have, in competition with an enemy &s;o much <HI>better furni&s;hed</HI> with every nece&s;&s;ary <HI>invitation</HI> and <HI>allurement?</HI></P>
<P>LET it be con&s;idered that our preachers do not addre&s;s <HI>innocents in Paradi&s;e,</HI> but thoughtle&s;s and <HI>habituated &s;in|ners.</HI> Mere <HI>cold reading</HI> will have but little effect upon &s;uch. For weak is the hold which <HI>rea&s;on</HI> has on mo&s;t men. <HI>Few</HI> of mankind have <HI>able heads. All</HI> have <HI>hearts</HI>; and all <HI>hearts</HI> may be <HI>touched,</HI> if the &s;peaker is but <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> of his art. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the preacher is not &s;o much to <HI>inform</HI> the <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> as to <HI>warm</HI> the <HI>heart.</HI> For there are few who do not <HI>know</HI> their duty; to allure them to the <HI>doing it,</HI> is the difficulty. Nor is this to be effected by <HI>cold rea&s;oning.</HI> Accordingly the <HI>&s;cripture ora|tors</HI> are none of them <HI>cold.</HI> They &s;pake <HI>in demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit, and with power,</HI> as having <HI>authority,</HI> and not as the cold Scribes. Their addre&s;&s;es are &s;uch as hardly any man can utter without <HI>warmth.</HI> It is true, the preach|er is carefully to avoid <HI>o&s;tentation</HI>; he is not to preach <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> but Chri&s;t. But, at the &s;ame time, he is to &s;tir up every gift that is in him; to <HI>cry aloud,</HI> and not to &s;pare; to lift up his voice like a trumpet; to reprove, correct and in&s;truct; to be in&s;tant in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on; to become, innocently, all things to all men, and con&s;equently <HI>to become and orator,</HI> if his hearers are not to be affected by &s;imple and unadorned truth, how|ever <HI>weighty.</HI> What can people think about <HI>the &s;incerity,</HI> 
<PB N="14" REF="042813_0013_101C95EA02E91E00">
or rather about <HI>the in&s;incerity</HI> of the preacher, who is <HI>cold,</HI> languid, and wholly unanimated in his public in&s;tructions; but is as warm as other men, in the defence of an incon|&s;iderable part of his <HI>e&s;tate</HI>? Would he &s;peak as calmly, as unconcernedly for his <HI>life,</HI> as he does in the cau&s;e of <HI>virtue</HI> and <HI>religion?</HI>&mdash;If it &s;hould be &s;aid by preachers, "the people will be as much offended with us, if we <HI>over-act</HI> our part, as they are now indifferent about at|tending our mini&s;try; &s;o that it will avail nothing to &s;tudy and practi&s;e <HI>a more lively delivery:</HI>" To this it may be an&s;wered, that a manner of preaching may be u&s;ed, which &s;hall have ten times more <HI>life</HI> and <HI>vivacity</HI> in it than the <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> and yet, if it be not incorrect, or un|natural, be very &s;afe from all danger of exceeding due bounds, as to <HI>vivacity</HI> and <HI>force.</HI> And in fact we do ob|&s;erve, that no preacher is <HI>admired,</HI> I do not mean by the mob, but by people of education, who&s;e <HI>delivery is dull and unanimated.</HI>&mdash;The great Doctor <HI>Delany,</HI> among other hints proper for a young preacher, &s;aid, that "when|ever he went up into a pulpit, he de&s;ired to look upon it as the la&s;t time he &s;hould ever preach, or the la&s;t time that the people &s;hould ever hear him." If all preachers, however dignified, went always up into their re&s;pective pulpits thus impre&s;&s;ed; they would then preach, as <HI>Ap|pelles</HI> once &s;aid he painted, <HI>for eternity.</HI> They would then act the part of <HI>true go&s;pel Chri&s;tian orators,</HI> and not only calmly and coolly inform the <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> but by <HI>per&s;ua&s;ive and pathetic addre&s;s</HI> endeavour to <HI>move the affections, and warm the heart.</HI> To act otherwi&s;e, be|&s;peaks a &s;ad ignorance of human nature, and &s;uch an inexcu&s;able indolence and indifference in the preacher, as mu&s;t con&s;train his hearers to &s;u&s;pect that the preacher, let him be who he will, <HI>only deals in the fal&s;e commerce of
