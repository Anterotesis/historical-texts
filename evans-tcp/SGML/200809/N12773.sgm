<HEAD>OCTOBER <HI>1</HI>&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>THE Pre&s;ident, Members, and Judge Advocate being duly &s;worn, the Court proceed to the trial of Major General Schuyler, who appears, and the following charge (contained in a report of a Committee of Congre&s;s, appointed to examine the evidence collected, and &s;tate charges, again&s;t the General Officers, who were in the Northern Department when Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated) is exhibited again&s;t him.</P>
<P><HI>Neglect of Duty,</HI> in not being pre&s;ent at Ticonderoga to di&s;charge the functions of his command, from the middle of June, 1777, until it was no longer po&s;&s;ible to maintain Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the troops and &s;tores, when he &s;hould have cau&s;ed a retreat to be made for the pre&s;ervation of both,&mdash;under the 5th article of the 18th &s;ection of the Rules and Articles of War.</P>
<P>Major General Schuyler, being de&s;ired to plead, &s;ays, I admit that I was ab&s;ent from Ticonderoga from the 24th of June to the conclu&s;ion of the &s;iege, but I beg leave to in&s;i&s;t, and doubt not &s;hall be able to prove, that I was guilty of no neglect of duty in not being there.</P>
<P>The Judge Advocate ob&s;erves, That Major General Schuyler having been appointed to command the Northern Department (including Albany, Ticonderoga, Fort Stanwix, and their dependencies) he was, by Congre&s;s, on the 22d of May, 1777, relea&s;ed from all re&s;traint re&s;pecting the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his Head-Quarters.</P>
<P>That, by letters to him from General St. Clair, Commanding Officer at Ticonderoga, dated the 13th, 18th, 24th, 25th, 26th, 28th and 30th of June, and 1&s;t of July, 1777, he was informed of the de&s;igns, &s;trength and advance of the enemy again&s;t Ticonderoga, and of the great danger in which that po&s;t and Mount Independence would be, in ca&s;e of an attack.</P>
<P>That it appears, in con&s;equence of the letters of the 13th and 18th of June, he went to Ticonderoga; for on the 20th he there held a Council of War. That, although in this Council of War it was determined that the effective rank and file were greatly inadequate to the defence of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, but that neverthele&s;s both po&s;ts ought to be maintained as long as po&s;&s;ible, con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the troops and &s;tores, and that the fortifications and lines on Mount Independence were very deficient, and that the repairs and additions to them ought to claim immediate attention, yet General Schuyler made no &s;tay at Ticonderoga, to expedite the works on Mount Independence, and to cau&s;e a retreat to be made, when it became no longer po&s;&s;ible to maintain the po&s;ts, con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the troops and &s;tores; for his ab&s;ence appears from General St. Clair's letter to him on the 24th of June, and tho&s;e that followed.</P>
<P>That, Ticonderoga and Mount Independence being the po&s;ts of greate&s;t defence to the United States again&s;t the advance of the Briti&s;h forces from Canada, and the main army of the Northern Department being &s;tationed at tho&s;e po&s;ts, it was General Schuyler's duty to have been at the head of that army, and to have remained there, when he knew the enemy were actually advanced again&s;t it. That his forces were greatly inadequate to the defence of the po&s;ts, and that they were to be abandoned in the moment when it &s;hould become no longer po&s;&s;ible to maintain them, con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the troops and &s;tores, a moment, of which it was nece&s;&s;ary the fir&s;t-officer in the department &s;hould judge.</P>
<P>That, in the ab&s;ence of General Schuyler, this critical and important moment pa&s;&s;ed unob&s;erved or un|improved; for on the 6th day of July the po&s;ts were abandoned, with the lo&s;s of the &s;ick, ammunition, cannon, provi&s;ion and cloathing of the army, and the lo&s;s of many lives in the retreat.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HERE follows the &s;ub&s;tance of the information given by two men from Canada, taken pri&s;oners by one of our parties on Onion River.</P>
<P>That General Burgoyne is arrived in Canada, but has brought no troops with him; that the Briti&s;h army is a&s;&s;embling as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible at St. John's; that the light infantry, which they call the flying army, commanded by General Frazer, is already advanced to Point-au-Fer; that the whole army is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of about ten thou&s;and men, a part of which, with Indians under the command of Sir John John&s;on, and Canadians under Captain Mackay, are to penetrate the country by the Mohawk River, whil&s;t the re&s;t of the army under General Burgoyne cro&s;&s;es the Lake to attack this place; that their fleet (a particular account of which is in the inclo&s;ed letter to General Sullivan) is all on the Lake, and we may depend on their being here in a fortnight at farthe&s;t.</P>
<P>From the nature and circum&s;tance of the pa&s;s granted to one of the two, which I here inclo&s;e, and his own account of the manner in which he was &s;ent from Montreal, viz. to &s;earch plans of the country which he pretended to know were hid at Metcalf's, and his being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;iderable &s;um of continental money, and &s;ome gold and &s;ilver, I have the &s;tronge&s;t &s;u&s;picion of his being a &s;py, and have &s;ecured him as &s;uch, and &s;ent him down to you, both that you might have an opportunity to examine him your&s;elf, and that, if you &s;hould think of him as I do, he might be tried at Albany, where, &s;hould he be found guilty, the &s;entence will probably be more adequate to the crime than here; for I find the officer who lately &s;uffered a &s;py he had in charge to e&s;cape, through the gro&s;&s;e&s;t mi&s;conduct, has been honourably acquitted by a Court Martial.</P>
<P>You will likewi&s;e find a letter from Col. Bailey, containing the intelligence brought by two Frenchmen &s;ent down by General Gates. Though their intelligence differs very materially, they agree in the circum&s;tance of General Burgoyne's arrival; and if the&s;e fellows have really been &s;ent by him to &s;ee what we were about, there was no method more likely to procure them an ea&s;y reception than that of giving an account of the preparations in Canada, and carrying, or pretending to carry, letters from our friends. The letter to General Sullivan may notwith&s;tanding be genuine, and Am&s;bury &s;ays it was written by one Michael Shannon. This name was found upon him on a &s;eparate piece of paper, in a fair hand, which he &s;eemed unwilling to part with, and which I &s;uppo&s;e to have been a private &s;ignal by which he was to be known upon his return.</P>
<P>If the enemy intend to attack us, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, we are very ill prepared to receive them. The whole amount of the continental troops, fit for duty, is 1576 rank and file, exclu&s;ive of Baldwin's artificers 140, and Whitcomb's 52 rangers. Be&s;ides the&s;e there are three regiment of Hamp&s;hire militia, engaged for no par|ticular time, and who go off whenever they plea&s;e, 150 are gone &s;ince la&s;t return; two regiments of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts militia of 252 rank and file fit for duty, engaged for two months from their arrival, three weeks of which with &s;ome of them is already expired. Among&s;t the number returned &s;ick there is no doubt but many would be u&s;eful in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, but at any rate we cannot reckon upon more than 2200 men. I am very much concerned to give you this di&s;agreeable detail, but I have &s;omething wor&s;e to add to it.&mdash;We cannot increa&s;e our numbers by calling in the militia without ruin; for by the Commi&s;&s;ary's return, and the account of his weekly expenditure, there is meat for &s;even weeks only on the ground, and he has no pro&s;pect of any &s;upply of &s;alt-meat, but from &s;ome place near Still-Water, nor of fre&s;h, but by &s;ending to New-England for it.&mdash;This I have de&s;ired him to do, but mu&s;t own I have little pro&s;pect of advantage from it; for be a&s;&s;ured that, and indeed every other communication, may and will very ea&s;ily be cut off.&mdash;I have heard of &s;ome cattle below Crown-Point, which I &s;hall &s;end for to-morrow.</P>
<P>The bridge goes on tolerably well, but is indeed a very heavy trouble&s;ome job.&mdash;The ca&s;&s;oons, Colonel Baldwin &s;ays, will be &s;unk by the end of next week; in the mean time I have ordered the floating bridge to be removed to the lower &s;ide of them, which will &s;erve as a kind of &s;econd boom, and retard at lea&s;t, if not prevent, the enemy's ve&s;&s;els from pa&s;&s;ing, &s;hould they attempt it.</P>
<P>A magazine of wood &s;hould be laid in immediately, but how to effect it I know not, as there are no teams here of any kind, and not a &s;tick upon the Mount.&mdash;All the timber for the bridge is hauled out of the woods by hand, and employs a much greater number of men than would otherwi&s;e be nece&s;&s;ary, and might be employed, and are wanted for other purpo&s;es.&mdash;What can the Quarter-Ma&s;ter mean by leaving this place, where &s;o many works are to be carried on, without &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an article as draught cattle?</P>
<P>The tents here are in general very bad. I mu&s;t beg you, my dear General, to ha&s;ten up the new tents, for I &s;hall get no good of the troops here in any way, whil&s;t they remain in barracks.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="016142_0004_0F9B8E5D69B36A40">Our powder magazines are in &s;o wretched a &s;tate, that I am told near fifty pounds of powder a week is damaged. In &s;hort, every thing is &s;o much out of order, that I will add no more to this li&s;t of grievances, than to tell you we have no cartridge paper.</P>

<P>I forgot to mention a paper in which Am&s;bury's money was wrapped, and is al&s;o inclo&s;ed; it is blurred and blotted, but you will ob&s;erve it contains a letter from Eph.

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INCLOSED you have the returns of the troops and &s;tores at this place, all except the cloathier's, which is &s;o drained I thought it needle&s;s to a&s;k for any from him, as he has almo&s;t literally nothing.</P>
<P>Since my la&s;t I have had con&s;tant &s;couts out, but have made no di&s;covery of the enemy, &s;ave that four of their ve&s;&s;els are lying about a mile on the hither &s;ide of the Split Rock; they con&s;i&s;t of two &s;hips, and two gondolas; and on Friday la&s;t a &s;chooner beat up within four miles of Crown Point, but, without landing any of her people, or coming to anchor, returned down the lake.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday about noon we had two men, who had &s;trolled out of camp without arms, taken by a party of &s;avages, who had &s;tole down to the road &s;ide betwixt M'Into&s;h's and the bridge, and concealed them&s;elves in the bu&s;hes; they were immediately pur&s;ued as far as Putnam's Creek, but could not be overtaken; un|luckily, however, they fell in with a &s;couting party I had &s;ent down to di&s;cover the motions of the enemy, that were upon their return, and fired upon them unexpectedly; the officer is wounded, one man killed and &s;calped, and one mi&s;&s;ing, but whether taken or not is as yet uncertain.</P>
<P>Another party that I had ordered to proceed to Point-au-Fer, or wherever the enemy might be, returned la&s;t night on di&s;covering a large party of Indians on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the lake about four miles above Crown Point. I think of &s;ending to feel their pul&s;e to-night, as I am &s;ure it would be of con&s;equence to give the&s;e fellows a drubbing.</P>
<P>I am at a lo&s;s to form a judgment of the de&s;igns of the enemy. If they mean to attack us, one would think it indi&s;creet to put us on our guard by &s;uch a trifling affair, and yet I cannot think they could prevail with any number of the &s;avages to come on, unle&s;s they had an army not far off to &s;upport them. Be that as it will, I &s;hall u&s;e every precaution po&s;&s;ible again&s;t &s;urprize, and will endeavour to penetrate their de&s;igns. The &s;ame rea&s;on, notwith&s;tanding our weakne&s;s, &s;till prevails again&s;t calling for the militia as when I wrote la&s;t, having as yet received no &s;upply of meat either fre&s;h or &s;alt.</P>
<P>Do you know, Sir, any thing about the terms upon which Capt. Whitcomb's corps was rai&s;ed. He informs me, that by General Gates's orders he promi&s;ed his people that they &s;hould have the &s;ame bounty as the troops of the State in which they were rai&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding they were not part of their quota. This promi&s;e has not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een complied with, and they are held by a conditional agreement only, which expires this day. I &s;hall be able to retain them, however, until you favour me with your an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I am making &s;ome improvement upon the Mount, but that and the Ticonderoga &s;ide have &s;uch dependence upon, and connection with, each other, that in my opinion it will be very dangerous to give up either, and yet it is certain we cannot with our pre&s;ent numbers hold both. I de&s;ign, however, to make the appearance of doing it, and, after defending Ticonderoga as long as po&s;&s;ible, retreat to Mount Independence.</P>
<P>Our guards are crouded with tories; they are dangerous here, and cannot properly be tried. I have ordered them to Albany. <HI>I am, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>SERJEANT HEATH, who I &s;ent down the lake to make di&s;coveries, returned la&s;t night, and informs me, that on Tue&s;day la&s;t he &s;aw two birch canoes going down the lake with &s;ixteen Indians and three white men in them, and &s;uppo&s;es it was the party that had done the mi&s;chief near the lines the day before&mdash; that from a place near the mouth of Otter Creek, he &s;aw three ve&s;&s;els under &s;ail beating up, one at anchor about one mile above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">plit Rock, and the Thunderer behind it&mdash;from this place he likewi&s;e de&s;cried an encampment of the enemy on both &s;ides of Gilliland's Creek&mdash;that from the appearance of it, and the extent, he thinks it mu&s;t contain a great body of men, and that a number of &s;moaks aro&s;e at a di&s;tance back, which he &s;uppo&s;es was from the encampment of the Indian&mdash;that on Friday la&s;t, from Pointon, he &s;aw twenty batteaus come out of Gilliland's Creek, and &s;ail up the lake pa&s;t the Split Rock towards Ticonderoga&mdash;that one of the inhabitants, in whom he could place confidence, informed him the Indians were very numerous&mdash; that they frequently cro&s;s to the ea&s;t &s;ide of the lake, and that a party of them had been at his hou&s;e a few minutes before his arrival&mdash;that he then returned to Otter Creek, where he propo&s;ed to have halted to refre&s;h his party, but, on being informed that a large party of Indians were at one Briton's, he made the be&s;t of his way here&mdash;one of his party this day fell behind a little, and was either taken or de&s;erted; he &s;u&s;pects the latter, becau&s;e he both waited for him, and &s;ent back to look for him&mdash;that one Webb, another inhabitant, informed him that the enemy had been four or five days at Gilliland's&mdash;that they came up with a va&s;t number
<PB N="6" REF="016142_0005_0F9B8E5E83043398">
of batteaus and &s;ome gondolas&mdash;that &s;ome of the troops come over frequently, and &s;ay their whole army is there, and that they are only waiting the arrival of the re&s;t of their ve&s;&s;els and &s;tores, when they are to attack this place.</P>
<P>I have no doubt that a party of the enemy are at Gilliland's, nor that their de&s;ign is to come here, but not in my opinion to attack, but to harra&s;s us, and give confidence to their &s;avages, who, it is more than probable, would not have been prevailed upon to undertake it without being joined by &s;ome regular troops. Were they in force, it is improbable they would wa&s;te their time at &s;uch a di&s;tance, in a part of the country where they can find nothing to refre&s;h them&s;elves; and I do not find that they have made any depredations on the ea&s;t &s;ide.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to judge of the force at a di&s;tant view of an encampment, and Heath mu&s;t have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> miles or more di&s;tant from that on Gilliland's Point, a di&s;tance too great to determine any thing with pre|ci&s;ion, although he had a gla&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t his eye; be&s;ides, I think the ground is not capable of encamping a great number (for he in&s;i&s;ts on it they are not on the high ground, but upon the beach only) but of this you are a much better judge than me, as I never &s;aw it but once: Be the matter as it will, I &s;hall endeavour to guard again&s;t &s;urprize, and to di&s;cover both them and their de&s;igns; and, if opportunity offers, feel their pul&s;es a little.</P>
<P>I had all the ground between this and Crown Point, from the lake &s;ome di&s;tance over the mountains, well examined ye&s;terday with a heavy &s;cout, but they di&s;covered no enemy, nor appearance of any. Whitcomb &s;ays he is certain there has not been an Indiain but three in that quarter &s;ince the pri&s;oners were taken, and that it was three or four days &s;ince the&s;e three had been there; &s;o that the Indians &s;aid to have been about us, and fired at, were, I believe, the children of a di&s;turbed imagination.</P>
<P>You had an exceeding bad time to cro&s;s the lake, but I hope you got well over, and without any injury to your health, though it mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed, as I doubt if you was not obliged to be out a &s;econd night. I &s;hall write again to you by expre&s;s the moment I make any farther di&s;coveries; and am, with much re&s;pect and e&s;teem,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I INFORMED you ye&s;terday that an encampment of the enemy had been di&s;covered at Gilliland's Creek. La&s;t night two of their ve&s;&s;els came up to Crown Point, and this morning there are &s;even lying at that place; the re&s;t of their fleet is probably but a little lower down, as we heard their morning guns di&s;tinctly at different places. They have al&s;o debarked &s;ome troops, and encamped upon Chimney Point. Whether they have landed at Crown Point my &s;cout-boat did not di&s;cover, not daring to venture far enough down the Lake for that purpo&s;e, on account of their &s;hipping; but I have &s;ent a party on this &s;ide the river, which, I doubt not, will bring a ju&s;t account of their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I cannot help repeating to you the di&s;agreeable &s;ituation we are in, nor can I &s;ee the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of our being able to defend the po&s;ts, unle&s;s the militia come in; and &s;hould the enemy protract their operations, or inve&s;t us, and content them&s;elves with a &s;imple blockade, we are infallibly ruined. I have thoughts of calling for the Berk&s;hire militia, which are neare&s;t to us, and will probably be the mo&s;t alert to come to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, becau&s;e they are in &s;ome mea&s;ure covered by this po&s;t; but on that I &s;hall con&s;ult the other General Officers. This, however, is clear to me, that we &s;hall be obliged to abandon this &s;ide, and then they will &s;oon force the other from us; nor do I &s;ee a retreat will in any &s;hape be practicable. Every thing, however, &s;hall be done, that is po&s;&s;ible, to fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of the enemy; but what can be expected from troops ill armed, naked and unaccoutred. I &s;hall write you again as &s;oon as the &s;cout returns,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS moment I have received information from Hoite, of Otter Creek, that a large party of Indians and Tories are gone up that creek, &s;uppo&s;ed to be five hundred, and are de&s;igned to cut off the communi|cation by Skeen&s;borough. They took a pair of oxen from one of the inhabitants, and drove them about two miles above Middlebury Falls, where they halted the day before ye&s;terday, and killed and dre&s;&s;ed the cattle; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that to-night they will be at the new road near Ca&s;tle-Town, which is twenty-eight miles from hence, and twelve or fourteen from Skeen&s;borough. They reported that a very large party had gone on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Lake, to fall upon Fort George. That is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of 1000 Indians and Canadians.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o had ju&s;t now another attack at the Mills; we have two men killed, two taken, and two wounded, one mortally. The &s;cene thickens fa&s;t, and Sunday next, it &s;eems, is fixed for the attack on this place. We mu&s;t make the be&s;t we can of it, and I hope at lea&s;t to cripple them &s;o as they may not be able to pur&s;ue their fortune, &s;hould it declare in their favour.</P>
<P>I &s;ent a party down la&s;t night to reconnoitre them, who are not yet returned, which gives me &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s. I hope, however, they are &s;afe, and will bring me &s;ome intelligence of con&s;equence. I have &s;ome thoughts, if they are not numerous, of attacking them. If they get the wor&s;t, it will oblige them to recal their parties. If not, there will be too many left to become pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent to the Grants to inform them of the Otter Creek party, and to de&s;ire that all they can po&s;&s;ibly &s;pare of the militia may be ready to march at a minute's warning.</P>

<P>MY &s;cout, on which I depended much for intelligence, is not yet returned, nor I fear ever will now. It con&s;i&s;ted of three men only, the be&s;t of Whitcomb's people, and picked out by him for that purpo&s;e. The woods are &s;o full of Indians, that it is difficult for parties to get through. I &s;hall &s;end off Whitcomb him&s;elf
<PB N="7" REF="016142_0006_0F9B8E60199EAB88">
pre&s;ently, for intelligence I mu&s;t have, altho' I am very loth to put him upon it, le&s;t he &s;hould fall into the hands of the enemy, who have no &s;mall de&s;ire to have him in their power.</P>
<P>I &s;ent Colonel Warner to the Grants ye&s;terday, to rai&s;e a body of men to oppo&s;e the incur&s;ions of the &s;avages that are gone by Otter Creek, and have ordered him to attack and rout them, and join me again as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. I am very happy to find the country were apprized of the march of that party before Col. Warner got to Skeen&s;borough, as it will probably prevent their &s;ucce&s;s, and may end in their ruin.</P>
<P>We are going on with the nece&s;&s;ary works on the Mount as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and have removed the mo&s;t va|luable of the &s;tores and provi&s;ion to that &s;ide. The bridge is in very little more forwardne&s;s, to appearance, than when you left this place, but they tell me this day will fini&s;h the getting timber for it. The boom is likewi&s;e placed, but very feebly &s;ecured for want of cables.</P>
<P>A party of Bradford's arrived ye&s;terday in very good &s;ea&s;on, and has had a plea&s;ing effect upon our people, who, never the mo&s;t lively or gallant, began to &s;how &s;igns of dejection already. How they may hold out, God knows, but this has rai&s;ed their &s;pirits a little.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h the batteaus were all over &s;oon, or that you would not &s;end them. I am extremely apprehen|&s;ive that the enemy will po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">anding, in which ca&s;e they might fall into their hands. We cannot venture the teams now without a &s;trong guard, and &s;o many parties as we are obliged to make, with the fatigues, will very &s;oon wear down our men.</P>
<P>We can do nothing but form conjectures about the force of the enemy, for I cannot find a &s;ingle per&s;on, on whom I can depend, to venture among&s;t them for intelligence; but from their manner of beginning the campaign, I conclude that they are either in full force, or very weak, and hope by letting loo&s;e the Indian, to intimidate us. I incline to believe the la&s;t, but have as yet no certain rule to go by. However, we mu&s;t know &s;oon, and it is &s;aid they have marked to-morrow to attack. I beg leave to refer you for further parti|culars to Colonel Varrick, who takes the charge of this, and am,</P>

<P>THIS morning &s;ome of the enemy's gun-boats appeared at the Three Mile Point, when the alarm was given. We could &s;ee them di&s;embark a number of men, and the boats increa&s;ed to eighteen, which are now lying abrea&s;t from the hither &s;ide of the point to about half way acro&s;s the Lake. The batteaus in which they tran&s;ported their troops are not come in &s;ight, lying on the far &s;ide of the point, under cover of it.</P>
<P>Soon after their landing, a party, chiefly Indians and Canadians, pu&s;hed towards our lines. As we had a &s;cout down the Lake at the time of their arrival, I immediately &s;ent out two parties to &s;upport and bring them off. The &s;cout fell in with the enemy, and after a few &s;hot, in which they &s;ay &s;ome of the Indians were killed, they, being overpowered by numbers, di&s;per&s;ed, and part of them are got in, and I have little doubt but the greate&s;t part of them will yet make their appearance. It is probable, however, that &s;ome of them have fallen into their hands. We have had one or two alarms before this, but they were occa&s;ioned by their boats coming up near our guard boats, and their firing upon them.</P>
<P>My people are in the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition po&s;&s;ible, and I have no doubt of giving a good account of the enemy, &s;hould they think proper to attack us; and if the per&s;on I mentioned to you in my la&s;t pur&s;ues the opportunity that now pre&s;ents it&s;elf, they will go back fa&s;ter than they came on.

<P>NOT finding a convenient opportunity to &s;end off my letter, I have the plea&s;ure to acknowledge the re|ceipt of your letter of the 28th. The &s;ucce&s;s of General Wa&s;hington over General Howe is an event of &s;uch importance, as mu&s;t de&s;troy every pro&s;pect of the enemy's carrying their plans into execution, &s;hould they &s;ucceed here. I have ordered a feu-de-joye upon the occa&s;ion, and will find &s;ome way to communicate the in|telligence to the enemy. We have now two &s;hips, eighteen gun-boats, and three &s;loops, lying off the Three Mile Point, and they are forming a camp upon the Point, and retrenching it. This does not look like their being &s;trong. Other matters I hope to manage to-morrow morning, but cannot be particular for fear of accidents.</P>

<P>GENERAL SCHUYLER reque&s;ted the Council to take into con&s;ideration the &s;tate of this po&s;t, with re&s;pect to the number of troops nece&s;&s;ary for its defence, the di&s;po&s;ition of the troops, and mode of defence, the &s;tate of the fortifications, and the quantity of provi&s;ion that may be depended upon.</P>
<P>He al&s;o laid before the Council the draught of a letter, as from General Sullivan, in an&s;wer to an inter|cepted letter from Peter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ivius, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> at Montreal, to that officer, intreating their opinion upon the propriety of &s;ending that or any other, and to advi&s;e the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de of conveying one, if it &s;hould be the opinion of the Council that a letter ought to be &s;ent. He al&s;o begged their opinion upon the proceedings of a Court Martial, held at this po&s;t on the 20th day of May la&s;t, by which Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b Runnels was &s;entenced to death; and to know if the Council would advi&s;e him to pardon or execute the convict.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="016142_0007_0F9B8E6118DDC4B8">Captain Whitcomb, commanding two companies of rangers, rai&s;ed in con&s;equence of a re&s;olution of the Honourable Continental Congre&s;s, having repre&s;ented to General Schuyler, that it was under&s;tood by him, and promi&s;ed by General Gates, that the men were to have the &s;ame bounty as was given by the Ea&s;tern States for rai&s;ing the new army, that he engaged the men upon that condition to &s;erve during the war, or, if that was not allowed, for four months, which time is now expired, and that the men refu&s;e to continue in the &s;ervice until the bounty abovementioned be allowed them. General Schuyler reque&s;ts the advice of the Council on the premi&s;es.</P>
<P>The Council, having taken into their mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration the &s;everal matters &s;tated in the fir&s;t article, are clearly and unanimou&s;ly of opinion,</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> That the number of troops now at this po&s;t and Mount Independence, which are under 2500 effec|tives, rank and file, are greatly inadequate to the defence of both po&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> That both po&s;ts ought, neverthele&s;s, to be maintained as long as po&s;&s;ible, con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the troops and &s;tores.</P>
<P><HI>Third.</HI> That if it &s;hould become nece&s;&s;ary to evacuate one or other of the po&s;ts, and that it remains in our election which, that it ought to be the Ticonderoga &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth.</HI> That &s;uch cannon and &s;tores as are not immediately nece&s;&s;ary on the Ticonderoga &s;ide be removed, without delay, to Mount Independence.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth.</HI> That the fortifications and lines on Mount Independence are very deficient; and that the repairing the old, and adding new works, ought to claim immediate attention; and that the engineers be directed to repair and make the nece&s;&s;ary fortifications.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth.</HI> That the ob&s;tructions in the Lake to prevent the enemy's naval force from getting into our rear, and thereby cutting off all &s;upplies, or preventing a retreat, if &s;uch a mea&s;ure &s;hould unhappily become in|di&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, ought to be compleated with all imaginable di&s;patch.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh.</HI> That &s;o much remains to be done effectually to compleat the ob&s;tructions, that, with the few troops we have, there is no great probability that it can be done in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P><HI>Eighth.</HI> That although our forces may be adequate to maintain our ground on Mount Independence, yet, unle&s;s a &s;ufficient &s;tock of provi&s;ion can be thrown in before the arrival of the enemy, we having now only thirty-nine days provi&s;ion of meat kind, we think it would be imprudent to expo&s;e the army to be made pri&s;oners by the enemy; and that, therefore, it is prudent to provide for a retreat; to effectuate which, that all the batteaus now at this po&s;t be immediately repaired, and as many as can be &s;pared out of Lake George be brought hither.</P>
<P><HI>Ninth.</HI> That a quantity of provi&s;ion of the meat kind &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be immediately forwarded from Albany or el&s;e-where.</P>
<P><HI>Tenth.</HI> That immediate application be made to his Excellency General Wa&s;hington for a reinforcement to be &s;ent on with all expedition.</P>
<P>The draught of the letter, mentioned in the &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d article of what General Schuyler laid before the Council, being read, and &s;ome alterations made, was agreed to by the Council, and re&s;olved &s;hould be &s;ent to Mr. Livius.</P>
<P>That the &s;entence of the Court Martial on Caleb Runnels, a &s;oldier in Captain Miller's company, in the regiment lately commanded by Colonel (now Brigadier General) Patter&s;on, be carried into execution. On the &s;ubject of Captain Whitcomb's corps of rangers, the Council recommend that they be informed, that General Schuyler will immediately lay a &s;tate of the ca&s;e before the Honourable Continental Congre&s;s, and take their direction; that if Congre&s;s &s;hould not allow them the bounty given by the Ea&s;tern States, they will be di&s;charged, agreeable to their contract.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 21<HI>&s;t.</HI> General Schuyler informed the Council, that only four men of Captain Whitcomb's corps were willing to continue in the &s;ervice, unle&s;s the bounty given by the Ea&s;tern States was allowed them, and begged the farther opinion of the Council on the matter, who, taking the matter again into con&s;ideration, unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that, con&s;idering the weak &s;tate of the garri&s;on, the great u&s;e which experience has evinced the corps is of, e&s;pecially at this critical juncture, when the enemy have &s;o many parties of Indians in the vicinity of this po&s;t, the information given by Captain Mar&s;hall and Captain Alredges, which is hereunto annexed, the probability that either the State of New-Hamp&s;hire or the Ma&s;achu&s;&s;etts-Bay would be willing to &s;tand charged with the extra bounty, provided this corps were con&s;idered as part of their quota, it would be advi&s;eable to pay the bounty, and they recommend it &s;hould immediately be done.</P>

<P>Major General Schuyler proceeds in his Defence, as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Pre&s;ident, and Gentlemen of the Court Martial,</HI></P>
<P>AS Courts Martial may, with propriety, be con&s;idered not only as Courts of Ju&s;tice, but al&s;o as Courts of Honour, I am happy that my conduct is to be examined, and its merits a&s;certained by this. What|ever con&s;olation con&s;cious rectitude may afford me and others, who have rea&s;on to complain of calumny and detraction, I am &s;till too &s;en&s;ible of the value of reputation to my&s;elf and family, not to wi&s;h for the e&s;teem of tho&s;e who merit commendation, and, particularly, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the good opinion of tho&s;e great and good men, to who&s;e virtuous exertions, in the Council and the Field, America will be indebted for Liberty, Independence and Security.</P>
<P>The charge again&s;t me is &s;imple, and confined to one point, and the evidence adduced to &s;upport it is comprized in very little compa&s;s. I wi&s;h the nature of my defence would admit of equal conci&s;ene&s;s. But, gentlemen, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to remind you, that, to invalidate a charge of neglect, in&s;tances of attention and care mu&s;t be produced, and, of con&s;equence, that may defence will principally con&s;i&s;t of a detail of facts, and nece&s;&s;arily be prolix. Permit me therefore to entreat your patience, and to a&s;&s;ure you that I will &s;tudi|ou&s;ly avoid calling your attention to any matters, either of evidence or argument, but &s;uch as &s;hall appear to me e&s;&s;ential to the elucidation of the important que&s;tion you are now to determine.</P>
<P>On the 19th day of June, 1775, Congre&s;s did me the honour of appointing me a Major General in the American army, and &s;oon after to the command of the Northern Department, in which I was &s;uper&s;eded in the month of February or beginning of March, 1777, and re&s;tored to it on the 22d day of May following, and again &s;uper&s;eded in it on the 20th day of Augu&s;t, in the &s;ame year. Within the la&s;t mentioned period Major General St. Clair was, by Congre&s;s, appointed to take charge of the &s;orts at Ticonderoga. Tho&s;e &s;orts were inve&s;ted on or about the fir&s;t day of July, and evacuated on the &s;ixth day of July, 1777. During the whole time of the &s;iege, I am charged with having been ab&s;ent, and therein of having neglected my duty. To this charge I am now to an&s;wer. But as the readine&s;s or reluctance, of per&s;ons accu&s;ed, to come to trial, natu|rally creates pre&s;umptions for or again&s;t them, which become, with great propriety, part of the evidence on which their acquittal or condemnation will re&s;t, I beg leave previou&s;ly to lay before you certain facts and papers, from which not only my willingne&s;s, but &s;olicitude, for a trial will evidently appear.</P>
<P>As the lo&s;s of Ticonderoga was &s;en&s;ibly felt by all America, and had occa&s;ioned much re&s;entment as well as &s;urprize, I pre&s;umed that this enquiry would have been made as &s;oon as the nece&s;&s;ary information and evi|dence could be obtained, and therefore the re&s;pect due to Congre&s;s re&s;trained me from pre&s;&s;ing it until near two months after the date of their order had elap&s;ed. After this I took the liberty of writing to Congre&s;s &s;undry letters on the &s;ubject, of which the following are extracts. The receipts of all which, except that of the 4th of November and 26th of January, were either acknowledged by the Honourable Pre&s;ident of Con|gre&s;s, or by re&s;olutions founded on the &s;ubject matter of the letters, from whence the extracts, were drawn.</P>

<P>WHEN a man of &s;entiment, labouring under odious and injurious &s;u&s;picions, has in pro&s;pect a period which promi&s;es to afford him relief, and re&s;tore quiet to his mind, it is natural that he &s;hould anxiou&s;ly wi&s;h for its arrival. The conviction of a good and a clear con&s;cience leaves not a doubt in my mind, that the re&s;ult of the enquiry into my conduct will have that effect, and re&s;tore me to the full confidence of &s;uch of my hone&s;t countrymen as have been led away by popular clamour, and that I &s;hall &s;tand confe&s;&s;ed the &s;incere and affec|tionate friend of my country. Congre&s;s will therefore pardon me, if I am importunate on this &s;ubject. I have &s;uffered &s;o much in public life, that it cannot create &s;urprize if I anxiou&s;ly wi&s;h to retire, and pay that attention to my private affairs, which the lo&s;&s;es I have &s;u&s;tained by the enemy, and the derangement occa&s;ioned by devoting all my time to the duties of my offices, have occa&s;ioned; and yet the impropriety of re&s;igning them, before the enquiry has taken place, or the Committee reported my innocence, is too &s;triking to need dwelling upon.</P>

<P>THE weakne&s;s of the Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners, and the di&s;tance at which two of the members re&s;ide from hence, has frequently obliged General Schuyler and Mr. Douw &s;olely to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s. General Wool|cott has little hopes that he will be able to attend the next conference, and General Schuyler thinks it probable that he &s;hall before that be favoured with the orders of Congre&s;s, to attend at Head Quarters for the enquiry into his conduct. On the&s;e accounts, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the Board &s;hould be &s;trengthened, e&s;pecially as the bu&s;ine&s;s of the approaching treaty is highly intere&s;ting.</P>

<P>I HAVE already tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed on the patience of Congre&s;s, but I feel my&s;elf obliged to intreat their attention a moment longer. Eight months have already nearly elap&s;ed &s;ince the appointment of the Committee to enquire into the cau&s;es of the lo&s;s of Ticonderoga, and no report as yet made. What I have &s;uffered in the interim, although &s;upported by an approving con&s;cience, will be more ea&s;ily conceived by every man of &s;en|timent, than de&s;cribed by any. Let it &s;uffice for me to ob&s;erve that to a man, far from being indifferent as to the manner in which his character may be handed down to po&s;terity, the reflection that he may be called from the &s;tage of life before his &s;uperiors have ju&s;tified him to the world, or before he has had an opportunity given him to do it him&s;elf, creates the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable feelings, and the&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, encrea&s;ed by the reflection that a young family may be deeply injured, and the &s;uppo&s;ed guilt (however unju&s;t the &s;u&s;picion) of the father embitter the lives of his children. Let me then mo&s;t humbly intreat Congre&s;s, that the Committee may be ordered to report without delay; and permit me to beg of you, Sir, to advi&s;e me, by the return of the expre&s;s which carries this, of the determination of the Honourable Hou&s;e.</P>

I do not, however, wi&s;h to have it under&s;tood that the delay was intentional. Indeed, I &s;till retain the &s;ame opinion, which I have expre&s;&s;ed in one of the letters I have quoted, that I was confident it was not the intention of Congre&s;s, or of the Com|mittee, to let me remain in the di&s;graceable &s;ituation I was in longer than ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity required; but I impute that delay to the va&s;t variety of important objects, which claimed the attention of the Repre&s;entative Body of the United States towards the clo&s;e of la&s;t campaign, during the winter, and &s;ub&s;equent &s;pring, and which might ju&s;tify them in &s;acrificing the feelings of an individual to the more weighty concerns of the United States.</P>

<P>IT is with the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction, that the Congre&s;s received your information of the &s;urrender of Montreal, and the general &s;ucce&s;s which has attended the American arms in the province of Canada.</P>
<P>They are &s;en&s;ible of the various ob&s;tacles you had to encounter, and have unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that your conduct, attention and per&s;everance, merit the thanks of the United Colonies, which I have now the plea&s;ure of pre&s;enting to you.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s hear, with concern, your reque&s;t of leave to retire. They regret the injuries your health has &s;u&s;tained in the &s;ervice, and beg you will not in&s;i&s;t on a mea&s;ure, which would, at once, deprive America of the future benefits &s;he expects from your zeal and abilities, and rob you of the honour of compleating the glorious work you have &s;o happily and &s;ucce&s;sfully begun.</P>
<P>You have hitherto ri&s;en &s;uperior to a thou&s;and difficulties, in giving freedom to a great and oppre&s;&s;ed people. You have already reaped many laurels, but a plentiful harve&s;t &s;till invites you. Proceed therefore, and let the foot&s;teps of victory open a way for ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, and the happine&s;s of well ordered govern|ment, to vi&s;it that exten&s;ive dominion.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider! that the road to glory is &s;eldom &s;trewed with flowers, and that, when the black and bloody &s;tandard of tyranny is erected in a land po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by freemen, patriots cea&s;e to remain inactive &s;pectators of their country's fate.</P>
<P>Reflect, Sir, that the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of millions yet unborn is now to be determined, and remember that you will receive an honourable compen&s;ation for all your fatigues, in being able to leave the memory of illu&s;trious actions, attended by the gratitude of a great and free people, as a fair, a &s;plendid, and a valuable inheritance to your po&s;terity.

<P>But as the winter previous to the &s;iege of Ticonderoga, included in this period, was the &s;ea&s;on of preparing for the en&s;uing campaign, and as the commencement of that campaign proved unfortunate, and many have from thence inferred that due preparations were not made for it, I think it of importance that my conduct relative to it &s;hould be made known to you.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to remark, that the campaign, on our part, was to be merely defen&s;ive. The out|lines of the plan for the defence are contained in the following extract of a letter to a Committee of Congre&s;s, appointed to vi&s;it the Northern Department, &amp;c.

<SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AGREEABLE to your reque&s;t, I do my&s;elf the honour to communicate to you my opinion of what preparations I conceive nece&s;&s;ary to be made the en&s;uing winter, and what mea&s;ures to be adopted, effectually to prevent the enemy from penetrating into this country by the Northern or We&s;tern communications. If the enemy are not able to di&s;lodge our troops from Ticonderoga, or penetrate to the Mohawk River this fall,
<PB N="12" REF="016142_0011_0F9B8E62ABFD5A40">
they will probably attempt an expedition in the winter, Canada being able to furni&s;h them with &s;uch a num|ber of &s;leds as will &s;uffice to tran&s;port all their artillery and provi&s;ion, if their number &s;hould be 10,000; nor will our garri&s;ons of Ticonderoga or Fort George be any ob&s;tacles, as they can ea&s;ily pa&s;s by the former in &s;leds, at &s;uch a di&s;tance as to be out of the reach of our cannon, and the latter is too in&s;ignificant to make any re&s;i&s;tance, &s;o as much to retard their progre&s;s. It is therefore of the la&s;t importance, that as much of the army as can be kept together &s;hould be cantoned in the vicinity of this place, of which the enemy will be informed, and it will probably deter them from the attempt. But, &s;hould they remain quiet in Canada until next &s;pring, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that they will then make the mo&s;t vigorous exertions to penetrate either by Ticonderoga, or, what is much more likely, by Fort Stanwix. Both communications, therefore, claim our attention.</P>
<P>The fortifications at Ticonderoga &s;hould, in my opinion, be as much contracted as po&s;&s;ible, and a fort built on Mount Independence, to cover batteries near the Lake &s;ide, and the redoubt on the Ticonderoga &s;ide, &s;o as that the pa&s;s may be defended with a few men. The navigation &s;hould be effectually &s;topped by &s;inking ca&s;&s;oons at &s;mall di&s;tances, and joined together by &s;tring pieces, &s;o as, at the &s;ame time, to &s;erve for a bridge between the fortifications on the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ides. This work &s;hould be executed in the winter. But as the&s;e fortifications would not prevent the enemy from drawing their &s;mall craft over land, from beyond the Three Mile Point, into Lake George, the pa&s;&s;age of that lake &s;hould al&s;o be ob&s;tructed, either by ca&s;&s;oons from i&s;land to i&s;land in the Narrows, if practicable, or by floating batteries.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t a part of the army is employed in this &s;ervice, another body of troops &s;hould be &s;ent to Fort Stan|wix, to &s;trengthen that fortification, and to make &s;ome others, at &s;uch places near the Mohawk river as may be deemed be&s;t for the purpo&s;e of retarding the enemy, &s;hould they make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Fort Stanwix. And that we may be well prepared, and every department put in order, I conceive it nece&s;&s;ary that the com|manding officer of artillery &s;hould be directed to procure every nece&s;&s;ary in his department, that we may not have to &s;eek it when the campaign opens.</P>
<P>That the chief Engineer be directed to do the like.</P>
<P>That the Quarter Ma&s;ter General do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>That the like order be given to the Commi&s;&s;ary General.</P>
<P>That all the battraus now on Lake Champlain and Lake George &s;hould be put into the be&s;t repair as early as po&s;&s;ible, in the months of February or March at farthe&s;t.</P>
<P>That one hundred batteaus be built in tho&s;e months at Schenectady.</P>
<P>That a quantity of boards and plank &s;hould be collected at Fort George.</P>
<P>That a &s;ufficiency of pitch, oakum, and whatever may be nece&s;&s;ary for building and repairing ve&s;&s;els, floating-batteries or batteaus, be collected, and carried to Fort George, Fort Ann, Skeen&s;borough and Sche|nectady, in the cour&s;e of the winter.</P>
<P>That provi&s;ion for 5000 men, for eight months, be immediately brought to Albany, and carried in the winter to Fort Ann; a like quantity to remain in &s;tore at Albany, to be &s;ent to the we&s;tward, if there be oc|ca&s;ion. This is a matter that ought immediately to be attended to, and therefore a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;alt &s;hould directly be &s;ent to Albany.</P>
<P>That a large train of artillery, both heavy and light, &s;hould be &s;ent, in the cour&s;e of the winter; part to remain at Albany, and as much as may be nece&s;&s;ary for Ticonderoga and Fort George to be &s;ent there. This mu&s;t be done in winter, at once to &s;ave a va&s;t expence, and that we may not be embarra&s;&s;ed in the &s;pring with the tran&s;portation of articles &s;o extremely difficult to move.</P>
<P>That a Laboratory &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed at Albany, to fix all the ammunition nece&s;&s;ary for the campaign.</P>
<P>That fifteen companies, to con&s;i&s;t of a Captain, or Over&s;eer, and thirty men, be engaged for the batteau &s;ervice, and to be employed on the highways, and other nece&s;&s;ary works in the Quarter-Ma&s;ter General's de|partment. It not only ruins &s;oldiers to employ them in &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s, and is more expen&s;ive, but al&s;o weak|ens the army too much.</P>
<P>That four companies of carpenters, to con&s;i&s;t of an Over&s;eer and 25 each, be engaged to attend the army. If more are occa&s;ionally wanted, they can be procured in Albany or its vicinity. I have taken the liberty to enclo&s;e a li&s;t of &s;ome articles, that may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The duty of the Pay-Ma&s;ters &s;hould be clearly pointed out to them. Who is to appoint Pay-Ma&s;ters to tho&s;e regiments who yet have none?</P>
<P>What is to be done with the remainder of Living&s;ton's, Hazen's and Duggen's Canadian corps, and with the Canadian refugees now in Albany?</P>
<P>Are Nichol&s;on's and Elmore's regiments to be compleated? If &s;o, who is to grant warrants for recruiting them?</P>
<P>The bedding for the troops &s;hould be &s;ent as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Be &s;o good as to &s;end me a draft of Schuylkill ferry &s;cows, with their dimen&s;ions. I wi&s;h to have this as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If &s;illed woollen caps could be procured at Philadelphia, a quantity-&s;hould be &s;ent up to the army.</P>
<P>Gla&s;s for the barracks is much wanted.</P>
<P>Altho' the enemy's fleet on Lake Champlain is formidable, would it not be well to con&s;truct very large and &s;trong ve&s;&s;els this winter? If Congre&s;s &s;hould re&s;olve on doing it, a very large number of carpenters &s;hould be &s;ent up immediately, and guns and carriages provided.</P>

<P>The &s;upplying the army with provi&s;ions, when they are delivered to you by the Commi&s;&s;ary General, is a capital part of your bu&s;ine&s;s; and as it mu&s;t be done partly by water, and partly by land, it demands a watch|ful eye to keep a proper number of boats and carriages at each &s;tation. The provi&s;ion goes from hence in batteaus to Half-Moon, from whence it is conveyed in carriages to Stillwater. There it is again embarked in batteaus, and tran&s;ported to the Saratoga Falls. Thence by land acro&s;s a &s;mall portage. Thence by water to Fort Miller Falls. Then acro&s;s a &s;mall carrying-place by land, and again by water to Fort Edward. Then by land to Fort George or Fort Ann. From the former by water to the north end of Lake George, and by land to the Saw Mills, whence it is conveyed by water to Ticonderoga. If it goes by the way of Fort Ann, it is there put in batteaus, and conveyed down Wood Creek to Skeen's Falls, and rolled acro&s;s a &s;mall portage to the &s;outh end of Lake Champlain, and conveyed by water to Ticonderoga. Between this and Half Moon eleven batteaus are now employed, carrying from 160 to 170 barrels. As the days are now &s;hort, the batteau|men will not be able to make a trip a day, unle&s;s they are di&s;patched by &s;un-ri&s;e every morning. It is there|fore incumbent on you to &s;ee that done, and that it may not be detained at Half Moon, 34 waggons, at lea&s;t, &s;hould be daily employed between that and Stillwater. Seventeen batteaus are now employed in carrying it from Stillwater to Saratoga Falls. The&s;e mu&s;t make two trips in three days. Two waggons are employed at that place and four batteaus, to convey it to Fort Miller, each making three trips.</P>
<P>At Fort Miller two waggons are employed, and from thence twelve batteaus convey it to Fort Edward, where 70 waggons mu&s;t be con&s;tantly employed in tran&s;porting it either to Fort Ann or Fort George, from whence the troops are to carry it on, which you mu&s;t take care to &s;ee done. The lea&s;t reflection will point out, that if at any one &s;tation the provi&s;ion is detained, all above it are idle. To keep all going together is therefore indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, and will frequently require your per&s;onal in&s;pection.</P>
<P>Providing quarters for the troops is another part of your duty, and furni&s;hing tho&s;e quarters with every nece&s;&s;ary mu&s;t be done without delay.&mdash;2500 men will remain at Ticonderoga,&mdash;about 400 at Fort George,&mdash; 400 at Fort Edward,&mdash;1000 at Saratoga,&mdash;500 at Albany,&mdash;100 at Skeen&s;borough,&mdash;100 at Fort Ann,&mdash;500 at Schenectady,&mdash;200 at John's-Town,&mdash;100 at the German Flats,&mdash;and 400 at Fort Schuyler,&mdash;making in the whole 6200. For all the&s;e bedding, or &s;traw at lea&s;t, is to be furni&s;hed, fire-wood and barrack uten&s;ils, &s;uch as pails, tongs, &s;hovels, trammels, axe, and kettles. The&s;e are to be delivered to the Barrack-Ma&s;ter, who is to be accountable for them.</P>
<P>When troops march, all carriages are to be furni&s;hed by you. Indeed, you are to furni&s;h carriages and ve&s;&s;els for whatever belongs to the army, except the carriages for conveying the cannon, although you mu&s;t find the cattle to draw them.</P>
<P>A &s;tock of fire-wood mu&s;t be immediately laid in here, for the u&s;e of the troops, and the barracks put into the be&s;t repair. Directions are given by me for erecting the barracks at the other places.</P>

<P>THE care of the fortre&s;&s;es of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence being committed to you, as command|ing officer, with a garri&s;on compo&s;ed of your regiment and tho&s;e of Wood's, Dayton's, Irvine's, Burrel's and Whitcomb's, the artillery under Major Stevens, together with the light infantry companies under Captain Whitcomb, Colonel Baldwin, the Chief Engineer, with &s;undry artificers, and Major Hay, as A.

You will continually keep &s;couting parties on the Lake, as long as the &s;ea&s;on will permit it to be navigated, and when that is no longer practicable, parties mu&s;t be kept out on both &s;ides of the Lake, to give the earlie&s;t intelligence of the approach of an enemy. You will pay the &s;tricte&s;t attention to your guards and centinels, and puni&s;h &s;everely the lea&s;t remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in a duty, on which the &s;afety of the &s;orts and troops &s;o imminently depend.</P>

Bedding is al&s;o preparing, and will be &s;ent you as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, together with a number of iron &s;toves, which I have &s;ent for, to be put up in your barracks, for the greater comfort of the men.</P>
<P>You well know of what importance it is, that the greate&s;t attention &s;hould be paid to the health of the men.

<P>THE various bu&s;ine&s;s of your department, in making the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for the next campaign, will require your clo&s;e&s;t and immediate attention. I &s;hall therefore point out part of what is to be done, and which you are to execute without the lea&s;t delay.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="016142_0014_0F9B8E6589D3B770">Four thou&s;and iron &s;pades, as many iron &s;hovels, five hundred pick-a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, and one thou&s;and bill-hooks, are to be made, &s;o as to be ready by the fir&s;t of March.

<P>The batteaus in Lake George and Lake Champlain, and tho&s;e employed in Hud&s;on's and the Mohawk river, mu&s;t al&s;o be repaired in the month of February, or March at farthe&s;t. Fifty batteaus mu&s;t be built here, as many at Schenectady, and a like number at Saratoga, to be carried into Lake George. Timber, plank, boards, nails, pitch, oakum and cordage, mu&s;t be provided in time, and &s;uch a number of oars, &s;etting-poles, paddles and &s;coops, as you &s;hall find, upon enquiry, are wanted.</P>
<P>Timber mu&s;t be drawn this winter to the mills at Ticonderoga, Skeen&s;borough, and that near Che&s;hire's, in &s;ufficient quantities, at the two latter places, to keep the mills at work all next &s;ea&s;on. Not a moment's time mu&s;t be lo&s;t in procuring this timber.</P>
<P>All the boards that can be procured at any of the mills in the vicinity of Fort Edward mu&s;t be &s;ent to Fort George or Che&s;hire's. Tho&s;e from Wyng's or Park's mill to the former. All the others to the latter.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you continually to reflect on the difficulties attending a long land tran&s;portation, e&s;pecially in the &s;pring of the year, when the roads are almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able, working cattle weak, and forage extremely &s;carce. Whatever therefore can be tran&s;ported whil&s;t the earth is covered with &s;now, mu&s;t not by any means be neglected.

<P>Steel mu&s;t be immediately &s;ent to Ticonderoga, to repair the broken axes, al&s;o ten &s;etts of hor&s;e harne&s;s compleat. Iron pots, bra&s;s kettles, or &s;heet-iron kettles, mu&s;t be provided in number &s;ufficient for an army of ten thou&s;and men. About two thou&s;and five hundred may do.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have not been honoured with a line from Congre&s;s, on the &s;ubject of the preparations nece&s;&s;ary for the next campaign in the Northern Quarter, altho' I tran&s;mitted my opinion on the &s;ubject in the beginning of November, I conclude that the enemy's manoeuvres in Jer&s;ey have &s;o entirely engro&s;&s;ed their attention, that they have not been able to attend to what I &s;ugge&s;ted. I have therefore re&s;olved, without waiting any longer for their directions, as the winter is &s;lipping away, to carry into execution whatever I deem e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ervice, and which does not admit of further delay, of which, among&s;t other things, that of procuring a &s;uf|ficiency of cannon for the defence of Ticonderega, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is a capital article. I &s;hould therefore be glad to know what cannon you can furni&s;h me with, and where I may &s;end for them, as I wi&s;h that an article, &s;o ex|tremely difficult to move in the &s;pring of the year, &s;hould be carried to the places for which they are de&s;igned whil&s;t we are favoured with good &s;ledding. A very con&s;iderable quantity of &s;hot is al&s;o wanted; and as Mr. Living&s;ton's furnace is out of bla&s;t, I cannot procure them there. Can the&s;e be got at Sali&s;bury, and when? Be&s;ides the cannon for the forts, a number will be wanted for five or &s;ix &s;tout gallies which I propo&s;e to build in Lake George, to prevent the enemy's penetrating by that Lake, if they &s;hould be able to di&s;lodge us from the Ticonderoga &s;ide of Lake Champlain, and draw their boats by land into Lake George, which it would be po&s;&s;ible for them to do, altho' we keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mount Independence. By the way of Skeen&s;borough, I am morally &s;ure they will not be able to penetrate; as I hope, in the cour&s;e of the winter, &s;o effectually to ob&s;truct the Lake, between Ticonderoga and the Mount, as that no kind of ve&s;&s;els will be able to pa&s;s, unle&s;s they fir&s;t make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Mount Independence, which I think will be impo&s;&s;ible, if we can pro|cure men, cannon and ammunition. A &s;tock of provi&s;ion I &s;hall take care to lay in this winter.</P>
<P>Colonel Simmonds, with part of his regiment, from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, is on his way from hence to Ticonderoga. I &s;hall be extremely happy to &s;ee a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of troops coming on, for I very much fear that the garri&s;on will not be detained after the term of their enli&s;tment expires.</P>
<P>I &s;hall want two companies of carpenters, to con&s;truct the ve&s;&s;els intended for Lake George. Captain Le&s;ter and Captain Win&s;low gave good &s;atisfaction la&s;t campaign, and I wi&s;h them to be employed in that bu&s;ine&s;s. Permit me to beg the favour of you to enquire of them, if they will each rai&s;e a company, &s;o as to leave Connecticut about the fir&s;t day of April. As Fort George is an extremely healthy place, they will, in all probability, not &s;uffer &s;o much by &s;ickne&s;s as they did at Skeen&s;borough.</P>

<P>SHOULD the enemy leave us unmole&s;ted this winter, I &s;hall hope that they will not be able to pene|trate from the northward in &s;pring or &s;ummer, provided troops, cannon and ammunition, are furni&s;hed me.</P>
<P>By a letter from the Honourable General Ward, of the 16th in&s;tant, which I al&s;o received la&s;t night, I find that I am to expect no cannon from your State. There are none in this, nor can I procure any from Penn&s;yl|vania or Jer&s;ey. I am not yet advi&s;ed what Connecticut can afford me, but I am confident it will be greatly &s;hort of our wants. I therefore wi&s;h the Legi&s;lature of your State would recon&s;ider the matter, and &s;upply me with all the cannon you po&s;&s;ibly can. I mu&s;t al&s;o entreat that as much powder, lead and cartridge paper may be &s;ent, as can be collected in your State; and as the&s;e articles are much ea&s;ier and cheaper moved in winter than they can be at any other time, I &s;hall hope that they will be forwarded without delay.</P>
<P>The cannon, if any are furni&s;hed, might be carried directly to Ticonderoga, where the A&s;&s;i&s;tant Deputy Quarter-Ma&s;ter General will pay the expence of tran&s;portation. The powder, lead and cartridge paper to this place.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a letter to Congre&s;s, dated Albany, <DATE>December <HI>30, 1776.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>THAT I have not been honoured with the commands of Congre&s;s, on the various matters mentioned in my former letters, and in a paper which I delivered Me&s;&s;rs. Stockton and Clymer on the 11th ult. is mo&s;t probably to be imputed to the nece&s;&s;ity it has been under, of giving the clo&s;e&s;t attention to the manoeuvres of the enemy in Jer&s;ey. This con&s;ideration, and that of the winter's being con&s;iderably advanced, has induced me to proceed in making &s;uch preparations for the next campaign as I deem e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, without waiting the determination of Congre&s;s, tru&s;ting that Congre&s;s will readily pardon any <HI>&s;aux pas</HI> I may commit from erring in judgment.</P>
<P>On the 3d in&s;tant I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to General Ward, on the &s;ubject of cannon and military &s;tores. From the copy of his letter, which is inclo&s;ed, Congre&s;s will perceive that I am not likely to receive any aid from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay. I have, however, &s;ince the receipt of his letter, which was received on the 29th in&s;t. written by expre&s;s to the Honourable Thomas Cu&s;hing, entreating that the Legi&s;lature of that State would re|con&s;ider the matter, and furni&s;h what cannon, &amp;c. they can, and urged the nece&s;&s;ity of their being &s;ent whil&s;t the earth is covered with &s;now, as a great expence in the tran&s;portation will be &s;aved by the&s;e articles being carried to Ticonderoga in winter. I have made &s;imilar applications to Governor Trumbull, and the Pre&s;ident of New-Hamp&s;hire, and I propo&s;e in a few days to vi&s;it the Convention of this State on the &s;ame &s;ubject; for indeed, unle&s;s a &s;ufficient number of cannon and ammunition can be procured, we mu&s;t inevitably lo&s;e Ticonderoga, and what the con&s;equences of &s;uch a di&s;a&s;ter will be are too evident to dwell upon.</P>
<P>I have cau&s;ed ten black&s;miths &s;hops to be erected in this city, and have engaged workmen to be em|ployed in making intrenching tools, axes, nails, &amp;c. and hope, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;miths in the vici|nity, to get a &s;ufficient &s;tock of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary articles, provided I can any how procure a quantity of &s;teel, for which I have applied to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay; but left none &s;hould be &s;ent from thence, I mu&s;t again entreat Congre&s;s to order three tons from Penn&s;ylvania or Jer&s;ey, with all the di&s;patch po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I have ordered all the provi&s;ions that can be procured to be &s;ent to Fort George, Che&s;hire's and Ticon|deroga. I fear a deficiency of &s;alted meat, of which a &s;ufficient &s;tock &s;hould be laid in, as it would be ri&s;k|ing too much to depend on the precarious &s;upply of fre&s;h beef, at a time when the fortre&s;&s;es may be inve&s;ted by the enemy.</P>
<P>Forage is laying in for the cattle, which it will be nece&s;&s;ary to employ in the &s;pring, both at Ticonderoga and on the communication to it.</P>
<P>Directions are given for repairing the batteaus on Lake Champlain and Lake George, and for building one hundred and fifty, adapted to the navigation of Hud&s;on's and the Mohawk rivers and Wood creek. Should the enemy be able to force us from Ticonderoga, it will be po&s;&s;ible for them, although we keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mount Independence, to get into Lake George, by drawing their batteaus over land from below Ticonderoga; for although the ta&s;k would be arduous, yet it is fea&s;able, and ought to be guarded again&s;t. I therefore propo&s;e to build five or &s;ix flat bottomed ve&s;&s;els, of con&s;iderable force, on Lake George, and &s;hall begin to prepare the nece&s;&s;ary articles in the beginning of February, unle&s;s Congre&s;s &s;hould plea&s;e to direct other|wi&s;e; and about the &s;ame time I propo&s;e to begin the nece&s;&s;ary work of ob&s;tructing the navigation of Lake Champlain, between Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, which I hope to execute &s;o effectually, as not to leave a po&s;&s;ibility for any kind of craft to pa&s;s whil&s;t we keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the latter place, and which <HI>I think we can do again&s;t any force whatever, provided we have a &s;ufficient garri&s;on, properly &s;upplied with cannon, ammu|nition and provi&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>A con&s;iderable quantity of cordage and oakum is wanted. If it cannot be &s;upplied in this State, I &s;hall &s;end to Ea&s;tern ones, and &s;o indeed I mu&s;t for many articles that will be wanted. I wi&s;h therefore a re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, directing every State to comply with my applications in whatever they can.</P>
<P>The Indians have &s;ent me a friendly me&s;&s;age, and I have great hopes that they will abide by the neutrality they have promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve. A report prevails that the enemy have reque&s;ted the Mohawks to remove into the country, beyond our &s;ettlements, but I have rea&s;on to believe that it is void of foundation. I &s;oon expect a vi&s;it from a con&s;iderable number of Chiefs and Warriors. They are in great di&s;tre&s;s for blankets. Unfor|tunately we have none here. I have applied for &s;ome to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay and New-Hamp&s;hire, and may probably receive &s;ome from thence.</P>
<P>The Legi&s;lature of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay have ordered one-fourth of the militia of the country of Berk&s;hire, and one-eighth of that of Hamp&s;hire, to Ticonderoga, to continue three months in &s;ervice. Part of one regiment is marched from the former. What the whole number will be, from both, I cannot make a gue&s;s at. No troops are yet arrived here from Connecticut, nor can I learn that any are got to Ticonderoga from Hamp&s;hire, neither was any part of Colonel Warner's regiment there on the 26th; and Colonel Wayne advi&s;es me that he has no hopes of any troops remaining after the term of their enli&s;tment expires, unle&s;s it be the Penn&s;ylvanians, who, he believes, will not quit the po&s;t until regularly relieved. For three weeks, or perhaps a month to come, we have little to fear from an enemy, but as after that Lake Champlain will be pa&s;&s;able, it is probable they will make an attempt, as I am well informed that they have two regiments at St. John's, three at I&s;le-aux-Noix, and a &s;mall body, as an advanced po&s;t, at I&s;le-la-Motte; and I conjecture that they would hardly keep &s;o many troops at tho&s;e places, if they did not meditate a winter expedition. It is there|fore of importance that the garri&s;on &s;hould be &s;trengthened, and have therefore repeated my former applications for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Ea&s;tern States Tho&s;e of Van Schaick's and Gan&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">voort's regiments, that are rai&s;ed, are under orders to march to Fort Edward, Fort George, Che&s;hire's and Skeen&s;borough; but I fear the garri&s;ons of tho&s;e places will have left them before the relief gets there, which is detained through want of blankets, which I am trying to collect from the inhabitants in this city and county.</P>
<P>The non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers and privates of Colonel Nichol&s;on's regiment are all engaged in other corps, to &s;erve during the war, or for three years, and the officers mentioned in the inclo&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are unprovided for. I beg the direction of Congre&s;s with re&s;pect to them.</P>
<P>Colonel Living&s;ton has given me a li&s;t of &s;ome officers, copy of which I inclo&s;e for the approbation of Con|gre&s;s. Perhaps &s;ome of Nichol&s;on's officers might be provided for in Living&s;ton's.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the men in Colonel Elmore's regiment would re-engage for the war, &s;ome have already done it; but I have inhibited the recruiting officers of other corps to enli&s;t any more of the men, as they are &s;till to
<PB N="18" REF="016142_0017_0F9B8E672F4F6B70">
&s;erve to the middle of April, and that Congre&s;s may perhaps order that regiment to be kept up, that there may not be &s;o many officers unprovided for.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to know the plea&s;ure of Congre&s;s on the &s;ubject the &s;oone&s;t po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>We are greatly at a lo&s;s for iron rods, to make nails out of. If I knew where to procure them, I &s;hould not trouble Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>If any cannon are to come from Penn&s;ylvania, as I believe there mu&s;t, for I have very little pro&s;pect of getting a &s;upply el&s;ewhere, I wi&s;h them to be &s;ent whil&s;t the &s;now continues on the ground.</P>
<P>The Pay Ma&s;ter General informs me that he has very little ca&s;h left. A &s;peedy &s;upply will be nece&s;&s;ary, as &s;uch a variety of articles are to be purcha&s;ed, and &s;o much tran&s;portation to be paid for.</P>
<P>The Regimental Pay Ma&s;ters will &s;tand in need of very explicit in&s;tructions for the rule of their conduct. I take the liberty again to mention the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending them very &s;oon, le&s;t the accounts of the new army &s;hould get involved into that variety of confu&s;ion which has attended the old. If they do not arrive &s;oon, I &s;hall take the liberty to do it for tho&s;e in this department.</P>
<P>Much as I wi&s;h to do my&s;elf the honour to pay my re&s;pects to Congre&s;s, yet &s;o much is to be done here, and no other general officer in the department, that it would not be prudent for me to quit it at this conjuncture.</P>
<P>Colonel Pallefier was &s;o bent on going to Congre&s;s, and importuned me &s;o much on the occa&s;ion, that I con&s;ented, on his promi&s;e to return before the expiration of January. I hope he will not be permitted to tarry beyond that time.</P>
<P>I have ordered the director of the ho&s;pital to lay in a &s;ufficient quantity of medicine and nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores for the ho&s;pital. He will find it extremely difficult to procure them; I therefore wi&s;h, if po&s;&s;ible, that &s;ome may be &s;ent from Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to accept the compliments of the &s;ea&s;on, and may every &s;ucceeding one bring with it an increa&s;e of happine&s;s to America is my fir&s;t wi&s;h.</P>
<P>As I do not chu&s;e to ri&s;k this letter by the common expre&s;&s;es, I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end an officer, and Captain Bloomfield, a very de&s;erving one, of Colonel Dayton's regiment, is the bearer of this.</P>

By the inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from Governor Trumbull, you will perceive that I cannot flatter my&s;elf with the hopes of receiving all the cannon Congre&s;s has ordered in the re&s;olution of the 28th ult. but, &s;hould they even be &s;ent, we &s;hall &s;till want a very con&s;i|derable number in addition; nor &s;hould we be de&s;titute of a competent number of field pieces, left the enemy &s;hould change their route, and attempt an inva&s;ion by the way of O&s;wego.</P>
<P>Apprehen&s;ive that applications to the different States, for the many articles which are wanted, would be attended with t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o much delay, I &s;ome days &s;ince di&s;patched Mr. M'Carty to the Ea&s;tern States, to procure a number of articles which I enumerated, and among&s;t which were cordage and oakum. He gave me great hopes that he &s;hould be able &s;peedily to accompli&s;h his commi&s;&s;ion. Colonel Baldwin and Major Stevens, who left me early in December, had orders to procure whatever they could in their re&s;pective departments.</P>
<P>The re&s;olution, inve&s;ting General Wa&s;hington with &s;uch ample powers, will certainly be attended with very &s;alutary effects to our common cau&s;e, and &s;eemed indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary at this critical conjuncture. It will therefore doubtle&s;s meet with the approbation of every good American.</P>
<P>The Continental money is &s;inking with an alarming rapidity in this State; but as I doubt not but the Con|vention thereof will enter &s;piritedly into mea&s;ures conducive to prevent &s;o alarming an evil, I hope &s;oon to find its credit re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>As it is of great importance to be well informed of the enemy's intentions, I have made &s;eparate applica|tions to two per&s;ons in Canada, in who&s;e friendly &s;entiments to the cau&s;e of America I have the fulle&s;t confidence, and have promi&s;ed them a generous recompence, to furni&s;h me from time to time with the be&s;t intelligence. I have al&s;o directed Colonel Bedel, who&s;e influence with the Caghnawaga and St. Francois In|dians is very con&s;iderable, to attempt to gain information by their means. By receiving of it in three different channels, we &s;hall be better enabled to judge of the truth or fallacy of what is given us by any of them.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY I received &s;undry papers from Colonel Elmore and Mr. Kirkland, copies whereof I do my&s;elf the honour to enclo&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;alt &s;prings, mentioned in Mr. Kirkland's letter, No. 1, I conceive might be improved to advantage, if per&s;ons acquainted with the proce&s;s of making &s;alt were &s;ent up, and furni&s;hed with proper boilers. It is an article &s;o extremely &s;carce here, that I fear a deficiency of &s;alt provi&s;ion for the army in this Depart|ment. The &s;pecimen which Mr. Kirkland mentioned to have &s;ent me is not come to hand.</P>
<P>The information contained in No. 2 is alarming, but by a clo&s;e attention to it, and pur&s;uing proper mea|&s;ures, the intention of the enemy, I perceive, may be fru&s;trated. I &s;hall immediately &s;end up what Mr. Kirkland recommends, as nece&s;&s;ary to rekindle the council fire at Onondago.</P>
<P>I have Indians, more or le&s;s, every day with me, complaining of the want of cloathing, blankets e&s;pecially, of which we have not one. I clearly perceive that our cau&s;e will be mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially prejudiced, unle&s;s a large &s;tock of Indian goods be immediately &s;ent here. To tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s with Indians at any time is a mo&s;t di&s;|agreeable ta&s;k, to do it with empty hands greatly encrea&s;es the difficulty.</P>

<P>YOUR Excellency's favour of the 18th in&s;tant I had the honour to receive on the 28th. I cannot plead that bu&s;ine&s;s, altho' I am clo&s;ely employed, has been the only motive that I have not latterly done my&s;elf the plea&s;ure to write you. I well know that every moment of your time mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be engro&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e affairs, which, from your immediate &s;ituation, mu&s;t claim the earlie&s;t attention. I therefore contented my&s;elf with writing to Mr. Harri&s;on; but I fear either his or mine have mi&s;carried, as I have not been favoured with an an&s;wer to mine of the 3d and 21&s;t ult.

<P>I have not the lea&s;t doubt, &s;hould General Carleton leave us unmole&s;ted this winter, which I really do not believe he will, that he will pu&s;h very early in the &s;pring, and he may come in the latter end of April.

<P>THE di&s;tre&s;s I labour under, from the want of a &s;upply of Indian goods, is inconceivably great. I can, with great truth, &s;ay, that not above one day in ten pa&s;&s;es but that I have more or le&s;s of the Indians with me. At this moment I have twenty-five Mohawks, Oneidas and Onondagoes in my hou&s;e, de&s;titute of cloath|ing, and pre&s;&s;ing me to be relieved, and to continue the trade I opened la&s;t fall. It will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that a treaty &s;hould be held with them, previous to the opening of the campaign. The enemy will, early in the &s;pring, hold one with them at O&s;wego, and we mu&s;t guard again&s;t, and try to counteract the ideas they will try to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them with.</P>
<P>Mr. McCarty, who was &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t to the Ea&s;tern States to purcha&s;e &s;undry articles greatly needed in this depart|ment, has in part &s;ucceeded. Among&s;t other articles, he has procured between four and five tons of &s;teel, which may &s;uf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce. He could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> any camp kettles, or tin to make them of, but inform me that
<PB N="22" REF="016142_0021_0F9B8E69B6809748">
forty or fifty tons of tin is in the continental &s;tores at Bo&s;ton, together with a number of blankets, cloathing, &amp;c. but that the &s;tore-keepers advi&s;ed him that none could be i&s;&s;ued without the immediate order of Congre&s;s. I wi&s;h therefore to have &s;uch order expedited. I &s;hall, however, that we may not &s;uffer by the delay that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily take place before &s;uch order can reach Bo&s;ton, immediately apply to General Ward, entreat|ing him to prevail on the &s;tore-keepers to &s;end part of the tin, cloathing and blankets, of which we &s;tand in immediate need.</P>
<P>I have borrowed fifty thou&s;and dollars from this State, and con&s;iderable &s;ums from individuals, for the public &s;ervice, all of which is already expended, and &s;till every department is deeply indebted. I wi&s;h, therefore, that mea&s;ures may be taken to ha&s;ten a &s;upply to the military che&s;t here.</P>
<P>Neither Colonel Baldwin, the Chief Engineer in this department, nor any of the artificers rai&s;ing in the Ea&s;tern States, are as yet arrived, &s;o that I cannot begin the nece&s;&s;ary works at Ticonderoga, Fort George, &amp;c. as early as I intended, and as they ought to be begun.</P>
<P>As the garri&s;on of Ticonderoga is daily weakening, and that I have no pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy reinforcement, I &s;hall not dare to &s;end the cannon to that place, which are expected from Sali&s;bury with the fir&s;t &s;ledding, but order them to be left at Fort George and Che&s;hire's.</P>
<P>No ammunition of any kind is yet arrived here, nor do I know where to procure it. His Excellency General Wa&s;hington cannot furni&s;h me with any from Jer&s;ey. Perhaps it might be well if I was informed where the continental magazines are, and to which of them to apply.</P>

<P>I WROTE you ye&s;terday, but forgot to mention to you to give the Indians intended for Canada an account of the &s;ucce&s;s of our arms; for altho' I have done it here, yet I wi&s;h you to repeat to them, that after the enemy had obliged our people to leave Long-I&s;land and New-York, they attempted to get us between them and the &s;ea, in order to cut off our &s;upplies, but although they tried all &s;ummer to do this, they were not able to effect it. They then took a fort of ours, &s;ituate upon York I&s;land, where we could not come to its relief, becau&s;e their &s;hips of war prevented us. As &s;oon as they had taken this fort they marched into New-Jer&s;ey, and as mo&s;t of General Wa&s;hington's army was gone home, the &s;oldiers term of enli&s;tment being expired, he was obliged to retreat before them to Trenton; but, having collected &s;ome troops there, he fought them on the 26th of December, as is already related. On the 3d of January he pur&s;ued them, and fought them at Princeton, twelve miles on this &s;ide of Trenton. There he killed near three hundred, and took up|wards of two hundred pri&s;oners. He has &s;ince that taken ninety-five loaded waggons, and five empty ones, al&s;o eighty-four war hor&s;es, and upwards of two hundred pri&s;oners. The enemy are now at Brun&s;wick, and they cannot get away, except by flying to their ve&s;&s;els, becau&s;e General Wa&s;hington and Mon&s;ieur Fermoy, a General from Old France, and General Putnam, each with a body of troops, &s;urround them.</P>

<P>BESIDES the logs drawing to the mill at Che&s;hire's, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to order three hundred oak logs, from twenty feet and upwards, to be drawn to Mr. Wyng's mills, and to be &s;awed into oak plank for the bottoms of ve&s;&s;els. You will therefore take mea&s;ures to have them brought there without delay.</P>
<P>It is of much importance that I &s;hould be fully informed of every article in your department at Ticonderoga, and at every other po&s;t, place, mill or landing in this department. You will therefore furni&s;h me with a compleat return, with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. <HI>I am, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>FOUR or five tru&s;ty Oneida Indians are &s;ent into Canada. They will give the Caghnawagas of Canada &s;uch accounts, as I am in hopes will, in a great mea&s;ure, prevent them from taking a very active part again&s;t us in the en&s;uing campaign.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h we could have po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured them that peace had been concluded between us and the Chero|kees, &amp;c. but we had only news-paper information. If it is really &s;o, I wi&s;h to be advi&s;ed of it the &s;oone&s;t po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Captain Marqui&s;ie has delivered me a plan for a fort on Mount Independence, which I have given Colonel Wood to deliver to you; to whom I have al&s;o delivered a box, containing your mu&s;ical in&s;truments, which I wi&s;h &s;afe to hand.</P>
<P>I very much fear that the &s;tock of provi&s;ions Congre&s;s has ordered to be laid in in this department, will not be procured in time to be conveyed to Fort George and Fort Ann in the cour&s;e of the winter, and if it is not, I am almo&s;t certain that we &s;hall not be able to &s;end on any con&s;iderable quantity until towards the latter end of May.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A SNOW has happily fallen, which will greatly facilitate the tran&s;portation of the various articles that ought to be &s;ent to Fort George and Che&s;hire's, for the rea&s;ons mentioned in my former orders; but as the winter &s;ea&s;on is &s;o far advanced, that we have no rea&s;on to expect the &s;ledding will la&s;t much longer, I mu&s;t again entreat you to lo&s;e no time. The cannon from Sali&s;bury mu&s;t claim your fir&s;t attention. All the en|trenching tools already made &s;hould be forwarded without delay. Whatever provi&s;ions the Deputy Commi&s;&s;ary General may have in &s;tore here, or el&s;ewhere, &s;hould be immediately &s;ent on, as al&s;o the oars, &s;coops, and other uten&s;ils for the batteaus on the Lakes. The forage which will be wanted &s;hould be &s;tored as I have directed. Carpenters mu&s;t, without delay, be &s;ent up to repair the batteaus on both Lakes and at Skeen&s;bo|rough, together with pitch, oakum, and every nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e. The cordage for the ve&s;&s;els to be built at Fort George &s;hould al&s;o be there. In &s;hort, every article in your department, that can be procured, &s;hould be &s;ent up without the lea&s;t delay; for be&s;ides the extra expence of tran&s;porting the&s;e articles in &s;pring, when the roads are bad, you will, I fear, not be able to accompli&s;h it with all the wheel carriages you will then be able to procure, and the probable con&s;equences will be, that our army at Ticonderoga will be obliged to leave it, for want of the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies. You are therefore bound, by every con&s;ideration, to leave nothing undone a moment, which it is po&s;&s;ible for you to do, that we may not experience all the evils which would con&s;equently en&s;ue from an evacuation of Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>Va&s;t quantities of boards and timber will, in all probability, be wanted, as well for the army in this quar|ter, as for that which may be &s;tationed in the &s;outhern parts of this State. Provi&s;ion &s;hould therefore be made to procure them. And as the proprietors of mills find it impo&s;&s;ible to procure workmen to cut and draw logs, &s;uch of the fifteen companies of batteaumen and labourers now rai&s;ing, and that can be fir&s;t got ready, &s;hould be employed in cutting timber, and &s;leds procured to draw it to the mills.</P>
<P>The roads between this and Fort Edward, and from thence to Fort George and Che&s;hire's, al&s;o claim your early and &s;erious attention, and timber &s;hould be drawn for cau&s;ewaying where it is nece&s;&s;ary, and for erect|ing bridges where they may be wanted. To depend upon cro&s;&s;ing Hud&s;on's river at the two ferries, McNeal's and Jones's, with what &s;cows are now there, is too precarious. At each place two good &s;cows mu&s;t therefore be immediately con&s;tructed.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, all that I have at any time ordered that you &s;hould &s;end up, purcha&s;e or cau&s;e to be made, ought to be done with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch; for, if it is not, the bu&s;ine&s;s that will croud upon you &s;o va&s;tly when the campaign opens will involve you in inextricable difficulties.</P>
<P>A quantity of rum &s;hould be purcha&s;ed by you for the artificers employed in your department, that you may not labour under difficulties on that account.</P>
<P>I entreat you to pay the clo&s;e&s;t attention to every part of your department, that the public may reap the advantage of your exertions, and you the honour thereof.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of Orders to Colonel Baldwin, Chief Engineer, dated Albany, <DATE>February <HI>13, 1777.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Honourable Continental Congre&s;s, by a re&s;olution of the 28th December la&s;t, have ordered,
<Q>That a fort be con&s;tructed on Mount Independence; that the navigation of the Lake, near that place, be ob|&s;tructed by ca&s;&s;oons, to be &s;unk in the water at &s;mall di&s;tances from one another, and joined together by &s;tring pieces, &s;o as at the &s;ame time to &s;erve for a bridge between the fortifications on the ea&s;t and we&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="016142_0023_0F9B8E6CD2F2BD10">
&s;ides; that to prevent the enemy from drawing their &s;mall craft over land beyond Three Mile Point into Lake George, the pa&s;&s;age of that Lake be al&s;o ob&s;tructed in like manner by ca&s;&s;oons, from i&s;land to i&s;land, in the Narrows, if practicable, or by floating batteries; that Fort Stanwix be &s;trengthened, and other fortifications be made, at proper places, near the Mohawk River; and that General Schuyler, the com|manding officer of the Northern Department, execute the&s;e works this winter, and that the commanding officer of artillery, Chief Engineer, Quarter Ma&s;ter General and Commi&s;&s;ary General, provide and per|form whatever things in their re&s;pective departments are nece&s;&s;ary, or may contribute to the accompli&s;h|ment thereof; that there be a general ho&s;pital erected at Mount Independence.</Q></P>
<P>In order, therefore, to fulfil the intentions of Congre&s;s, you are immediately to proceed to Lake George, to examine if it is practicable to &s;unk ca&s;&s;oons in the Narrows in the manner directed; and if you find it &s;o, to report the &s;ame to me, and immediately to order one or more of your Sub-Engineers to execute the work. If it is not practicable, you will report to me, by letter, the rea&s;ons why, together with the depth of the water, and the di&s;tance from &s;hore to &s;hore, and from i&s;land to i&s;land. The report to be accompanied with a &s;ketch of the i&s;lands.</P>
<P>You are then to proceed to Ticonderoga, and, as I conceive the ob&s;tructions of the Lake will be much ea|&s;ier and cheaper executed while the Lake continues frozen than at any other time, you will fir&s;t execute that work. The ca&s;&s;oons &s;hould be &s;o far above water, as that the bridge may not be under water when the Lake is at the highe&s;t, and to prevent batteaus from pa&s;&s;ing underneath, when the Lake is at the lowe&s;t, a boom ought to be laid on the water on each &s;ide of the bridge.</P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary, the &s;oone&s;t you po&s;&s;ibly can, to prepare what timber and other materials may be want|ing for the con&s;truction of the fort on Mount Independence, and to furni&s;h me with an actual and accurate &s;urvey of Mount Independence, and a plan of the fort you may judge &s;hould be built on it.</P>
<P>You are al&s;o to lo&s;e no time in preparing and collecting the materials for a ho&s;pital, &s;ufficiently large to contain &s;ix hundred &s;ick, be&s;ides the nece&s;&s;ary apartments for the Director, and the other officers of the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>You will al&s;o immediately &s;end an engineer to examine and report the &s;tate of Fort Stanwix, and what works ought to be con&s;tructed there, and on his return to &s;ix on one or more proper places on this &s;ide Fort Stanwix, to erect fortifications, to prevent the enemy from coming down the river in batteaus, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be able to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of Fort Stanwix, or leave it in their rear.</P>
<P>Whatever carriages you may want for drawing timber for the works on Lake George, and at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, you are to apply to Colonel Lewis, Deputy Quarter-Ma&s;ter General, for, who will have my orders to furni&s;h you therewith.</P>
<P>The armourers tools, that are now at Ticonderoga, you will immediately &s;end to Colonel Lewis, to be delivered to &s;uch per&s;on as you may direct to &s;uperintend the armoury here, and leave orders for the ar|mourers to repair all the arms in this place, before they proceed to Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>Early provi&s;ion is to be made, to have a &s;ufficiency of battery carriages for the cannon that may be &s;ent up, and for &s;uch as may be wanted on board any ve&s;&s;els to be con&s;tructed. In &s;hort, you will u&s;e your be&s;t endea|vours to have every thing put in the be&s;t order, and what is to be executed done with the utmo&s;t expedition.</P>
<P>Carpenters always require clo&s;e attention, and to be pu&s;hed to their duty; you will therefore give &s;trict orders to all your officers to keep them clo&s;ely to work.</P>
<P>You will probably be able to procure &s;oldiers, who can work with the whip-&s;aw. You &s;hould therefore procure as many as you po&s;&s;ibly can, and immediately on your arrival at Ticonderoga apply for all the &s;awyers in any of the corps there, and &s;et them to work. It will be be&s;t to agree by the foot, becau&s;e it will be cheape&s;t, and that you will get more work done.</P>
<P>A hou&s;e to boil &s;oap and make candles in is much wanted at Mount Independence. You will therefore con&s;truct one, and al&s;o a bake-hou&s;e, as &s;oon as you can, and repair the provi&s;ion &s;tores, that the public may not &s;u&s;tain &s;o great a lo&s;s as formerly by damaged provi&s;ions.</P>

<P>THE blocks for the ve&s;&s;els to be con&s;tructed on Lake Champlain you will give immediate orders for mak|ing. They may probably be procured here; if not, write to the &s;uperintendants for building the frigates at Poukeep&s;ie to get them ready again&s;t the river opens.</P>
<P>Pray do not fail to furni&s;h me with the return I have &s;o long ago reque&s;ted, of whatever articles, ve&s;&s;els, carriages, &amp;c. are now in your department, and the condition they are in, that we may know what is to be done. If your Deputies neglect giving you the nece&s;&s;ary information, di&s;mi&s;s them, and appoint others that will do their duty.</P>
<P>Colonel Baldwin, the Chief Engineer, is directed to carry on very con&s;iderable works on Lake George and at Ticonderoga. You are to furni&s;h him with as many carriages as he may want, which I believe will be con&s;iderable. Each carriage &s;hould carry twenty days provi&s;ions. Among&s;t the carriages &s;hould be ten &s;leds, drawn by oxen.</P>
<P>The Deputy Commi&s;&s;ary General has returned three hundred barrels of flour at Skeen&s;borough; the&s;e mu&s;t be immediately forwarded to Ticonderoga; al&s;o one hundred and eighty barrels of beef, which are at Fort George, as &s;oon as Lake George is pa&s;&s;able, if it is not &s;o already.</P>
<P>He al&s;o informs me that there are about one thou&s;and barrels of beef and pork at Bennington and Lane&s;bo|rough. This mu&s;t al&s;o be immediately forwarded to either Che&s;hire's or Skeen&s;borough, which ever may be mo&s;t convenient.</P>

Some thou&s;ands of logs are already brought to the public's mills at Che&s;hire's. Parties are gone and going to bring timber to the mill at Skeen&s;borough, and to the other mills in the vicinity of Fort George, to mine and others on Hud&s;on's river. The expence of procuring this article in &s;ummer, on account of the difficulty of drawing the timber out of the &s;wamp, is &s;o exceedingly great, that I hope a very con|&s;iderable &s;aving will ari&s;e to the public.</P>

If the batteaus at that place are not already repaired, no time &s;hould be lo&s;t in doing it. The &s;chooner there &s;hould al&s;o be overhauled, and put into repair, without delay.</P>
<P>The &s;hip carpenters now moving up to Fort George will require a number of carriages, to draw in the timber for the ve&s;&s;els they are to build. The&s;e carriages you will furni&s;h immediately, and &s;end one of your a&s;&s;i&s;tants to &s;uperintend the works at that place.

If the &s;hip nails are not already forwarded, &s;end them on without lo&s;s of time. A company of carpenters, to con|&s;i&s;t of an over&s;eer and twenty men, mu&s;t be engaged, and &s;ent without delay to Fort Stanwix. Captain Mar|qui&s;ie, the Engineer, who is at Schenectady, will take charge of them.</P>
<P>Fort George will probably be navigable by the fir&s;t week in April. About that time therefore the work|ing cattle, de&s;igned for Ticonderoga and the Carrying-place, &s;hould be at Fort George, to be tran&s;ported without delay.</P>

You will give orders to &s;upply them with working cattle and men, and direct your a&s;&s;i&s;tants to procure a piece of land for the purpo&s;e.

He will al&s;o furni&s;h you with a company of carpenters, and provide batteaus to carry you, them, and &s;uch articles as you may want, to that fortre&s;s. On your arrival there, you will apply to the commanding officer for &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as you may need, who will have my orders to afford you all in his power. You will make the alterations agreeable to the plan you have laid before me, and to guard as much as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t any misfortunes that might be occa&s;ioned by an attack before the alterations are compleat, you will leave as much of the pre&s;ent work &s;tanding, whil&s;t the other is going on, as po&s;&s;ible, that the garri&s;on may be co|vered. Perhaps it will be be&s;t to begin with one ba&s;tion and the adjacent curtains, and to compleat as much of them as po&s;&s;ible before another is begun.</P>
<P>Whatever articles you may from time to time nece&s;&s;arily require, you will apply to Henry Glen&punc; A&s;&s;i&s;tant Deputy Quarter Ma&s;ter General at Schenectady, for.</P>
<P>Fortifications are at all times expen&s;ive; they become more &s;o, when the artificers are &s;uffered to while away their time. Your carpenters mu&s;t therefore begin to work at day-light, and work until &s;un-&s;et, al|lowing an hour for breakfa&s;t, and an hour and a half for dinner. No &s;itting down to &s;moak and drink at eleven o'clock, or at any other time, except that at meals. In very hot weather, two hours may be allowed at dinner.</P>
<P>Appoint &s;ome tru&s;ty non-commi&s;&s;ioned officer as ma&s;ter of the checque, and in&s;truct him particularly in his duty. Soldiers or women mu&s;t be got, to cook for the carpenters, and allowed moderate wages.</P>
<P>Inform me repeatedly how your work advances, and of what difficulties, if any, you meet with, that I may take mea&s;ures to obviate them.</P>
<P>I have the fulle&s;t confidence that you will make u&s;e of every exertion to forward the work, and promote the &s;ervice.</P>

<P>YOU will repair to Fort George without delay, and there, in conjunction with Captain Douw, A&s;&s;i&s;tant Deputy Quarter Ma&s;ter General, employ the carpenters in con&s;tructing two &s;trong &s;chooners, of &s;ixty feet keel and twenty feet beam. They &s;hould be &s;o con&s;tructed as not to draw above &s;ix feet water, when they have all their cannon and &s;tores on board; and as I conceive that they will be more &s;erviceable in proportion as their guns lay near the water, I would have you give them the lea&s;t height po&s;&s;ible. Be&s;ides, three other ve&s;&s;els are to be built without decks. The&s;e &s;hould be &s;o contrived, as to row fa&s;t, and to carry a cannon of twelve pound &s;hot in the bow, and as many on each &s;ide as po&s;&s;ible. Whatever articles you may want, and that are not to be had at Fort George, you will make timely application for to Colonel Lewis, Deputy Quarter Ma&s;ter General, that no time may be lo&s;t in procuring what may be wanted. You will examine the &s;tores at that place, and &s;ee what is there, and write to Ticonderoga to know what rigging and anchors can be &s;pared from thence, and cau&s;e them to be brought to Fort George as &s;oon as the Lake opens.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Colonel,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I PROPOSE early to-morrow to &s;et out on a journey to Philadelphia. You, as elde&s;t officer, will con|&s;equently command until my return, or the arrival of an officer of elder or &s;uperior rank. It is impo&s;&s;ible to particularize the variety of affairs that will claim your attention. I &s;hall therefore only mention &s;uch as occur to me at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="016142_0026_0F9B8E6F6A3E6C30">Colonel Wayne, and Lieutenant Colonel Van Dyck, are informed that the command devolves on you, and they have my orders to addre&s;s you on whatever &s;ubject they may have occa&s;ion to write. It is impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee what demands they may make, as they mu&s;t ari&s;e from exigencies that may happen. No in&s;tructions can therefore be given on that head, other than the general one, to do in every ca&s;e what you &s;hall judge mo&s;t conducive to promote the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As the late ho&s;tilities committed by the enemy and their &s;avages has already greatly alarmed the country, and prevents people from giving that a&s;&s;i&s;tance with their carriages which the public &s;tands &s;o much in need of, I have ordered reinforcements to Saratoga, Fort Edward and Fort George, that all carriages may have convoys, and the workmen at Fort George be covered by &s;trong parties, and the magazines at tho&s;e places pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ected and &s;ecured. You will therefore give your orders accordingly. The reinforcements are of the troops from the Ea&s;tern States; and the di&s;po&s;ition of your regiment and tho&s;e troops I wi&s;h to be as follows: One hundred rank and file, and a &s;ufficient number of officers, at Saratoga, who are to mount, be&s;ides the guards at the barracks, a &s;erjeant's guard at my hou&s;e, with centinels at the mills and &s;tore-hou&s;e, both of which contain great quantities of valuable public &s;tores; fifty, with like officers, at Fort Edward, and one hundred at this place; tho&s;e at Fort Edward will be joined by two companies of the troops from the ea&s;tward; the remain|der of your regiment at Fort George, to which I have al&s;o ordered three companies of the Ea&s;tern corps.</P>
<P>You will order Living&s;ton's to march to John's-Town and Fort Dayton, and Gan&s;evoort's to Fort Schuyler, to relieve tho&s;e garri&s;ons, the pre&s;ent commanding officers whereof are to deliver copies of their in&s;tructions to the officers commanding the re&s;pective reliefs. You will particularly charge the officers to be very attentive and vigilant. Tho&s;e at Fort Edward and Saratoga to keep &s;mall &s;couting parties con&s;tantly out to the we&s;t|ward. Colonel Wayne, and Lieutenant Colonel Van Dyck, have my orders on this head with re&s;pect to their commands.</P>
<P>A quantity of powder is arrived at King&s;ton, and is daily expected here, one ton whereof is to be left here, and the remainder to be forwarded to Fort George, where it is to remain until occa&s;ion &s;hall require it to be &s;ent on to Ticonderoga. A &s;trong e&s;cort mu&s;t attend this powder in all its route. The cannon that are &s;till here are to be forwarded to Ticonderoga, except tho&s;e carrying &s;ix pound ball and under, which are to be left at Fort George.</P>
<P>Every other kind of &s;tore that may be here, or may arrive, is to be &s;ent on, except &s;uch cloathing as may be nece&s;&s;ary for the troops coming in here.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to give orders for furni&s;hing Mr. Douw with &s;uch articles out of the public &s;tores, as he may apply to you for, for the u&s;e of the Indians.</P>
<P>You will order a court to apprai&s;e all the uninvoiced articles in the Commi&s;&s;ary of Cloathing's &s;tore; a copy of &s;uch apprai&s;ement, &s;igned by the Pre&s;ident, to be kept by you, and another to be delivered to the Com|mi&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>Major General Schuyler proceeds in his Defence, as follows:</P>
<P>&mdash;SUCH were the preparations for this campaign, made by me prior to the 26th day of March, 1777, when I left Albany, &s;oon after which General Gates took the command, and I tru&s;t they were &s;uch as, at lea&s;t, exclude any imputation of want of vigilance or care. The Court will be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that in my &s;everal orders I de&s;cended to minutiae, in a manner not u&s;ual for general officers, and which nothing but the mo&s;t ardent zeal for the &s;ervice could have prompted.</P>
<P>The third period extends from the time I re&s;umed the command to the evacuation of Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>On the fourth day of June, 1777, I again re&s;umed the command of the department, and I offer the following letters and orders as evidence of the manner in which I continued to provide for the exigencies of the en&s;uing campaign, and for the general defence of the whole department.</P>

<P>YOU will plea&s;e immediately to make me a return of the provi&s;ions in this department, &s;pecifying the &s;everal &s;orts, po&s;ts, places and magazines, in which it is &s;tored, the quantity in and at each, and di&s;tingui&s;h|ing the &s;alted meat from the fre&s;h, and noting what has been forwarded to Skeen&s;borough, Fort George, and the intermediate po&s;ts, &s;ince the 26th day of March la&s;t.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will plea&s;e to repair to Ticonderoga with all convenient &s;peed, and take the command of the troops at that place.</P>
<P>As the whole of our force in the Northern Department, if collected at Ticonderoga, would not be capa|ble of properly meaning the exten&s;ive works on both &s;ides of the Lake, and as Mount Independence is by much the mo&s;t defen&s;ible, and may be made a po&s;t capable of &s;u&s;taining a long and vigorous &s;iege, it is my intention that your fir&s;t care &s;hould be to be&s;tow the utmo&s;t attention to fortifying the Mount. You will therefore plea&s;e, immediately on your arrival, to give directions for erecting the nece&s;&s;ary fortifications, and employ all the troops that can be &s;pared from other duty and nece&s;&s;ary works in that bu&s;ine&s;s. If the ob&s;truc|tion between the French redoubt and Mount Independence is not compleated, that work will al&s;o claim your immediate attention, and I wi&s;h that &s;trong piles &s;hould be drove in the intervals between every ca&s;&s;oon, and others in the front of each ca&s;&s;oon, and if po&s;&s;ible a line of pickets drove acro&s;s the channel, &s;o far below Mount Independence, as that the cannon from thence may render it impo&s;&s;ible for the enemy's ve&s;&s;els to lay there, or be employed in removing the ob&s;tructions. This &s;eems to be work in the execution of which no time &s;hould be lo&s;t, as it may, by preventing the enemy's &s;hips from pa&s;&s;ing, enable us to keep up the commu|nication with our ve&s;&s;els, if the Mount &s;hould be inve&s;ted.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you to keep &s;couting parties con&s;tantly out on both &s;ides of the Lake. That on the we&s;t &s;hould go as far as the road by which the Tories la&s;t fall marched to Crown-Point.</P>
<P>Be &s;o good as to order returns to be made immediately by the Chief Engineer, Commanding Officer of Ar|tillery, Commi&s;&s;ary of Provi&s;ions, and Clothier, of every article in their re&s;pective departments, and of what is wanting in each, that the deficiency may be procured without delay.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;e you a credit on the military che&s;t for Ten Thou&s;and Dollars, to pay any contingent expences that may ari&s;e, and not payable by any of the civil departments.</P>
<P>I am confident that no officer is more deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving the health of the men than you, and I doubt not but you will be&s;tow much of your attention on &s;o capital a matter. Tents are arrived here, and orders are given to &s;end up five hundred. If more are wanted, you will plea&s;e to &s;ignify it to me.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to &s;end me a return of the troops at Ticonderoga, as &s;oon after your arrival as you po&s;&s;ibly can.</P>
<P>You will lay in a magazine of fire wood on Mount Independence, to be pre&s;erved in ca&s;e of a &s;iege, and to be as &s;paring of the &s;alt meat as you po&s;&s;ibly can, con&s;i&s;tent with the health of the men.</P>
<P>As an arrangement of the troops into brigades cannot &s;o properly be made here as at Ticonderoga, and it being probable that I &s;hall not be able to repair to that place until towards the end of the month, you will plea&s;e, con&s;ulting with the other general officers, to brigade them, putting the militia into one by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>You will give directions that no con&s;iderable quantity of provi&s;ion, or other military &s;tores, are at any time left on the carrying place at the north end of Lake George.</P>
<P>As the health of the troops is very much injured by an improper mode of dre&s;&s;ing their victuals, I wi&s;h you to order an officer of every company daily to &s;uperintend that bu&s;ine&s;s; and as I conceive it would be for the benefit of the troops to be furni&s;hed with kettles &s;ufficiently large to cook for a whole company, I have or|dered the Deputy Quarter Ma&s;ter General to &s;end twenty to Ticonderoga for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e to cau&s;e a &s;urvey to be made of the &s;alted meat. I apprehend much of it will require to be repacked and well brined.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be extremely happy frequently to be favoured with a line from you.</P>

You will immediately cau&s;e the &s;ame to be conveyed to Ticonderoga, except 100 barrels of flour, 50 barrels of pork, 50 barrels of beef, and 50 bu&s;hels of pea&s;e. You will &s;end 32 of the &s;mall batteaus into Lake George, 30 of which to be con|veyed into Lake Champlain, from thence into Wood Creek. The large batteaus now in Wood Creek to be carried below the Falls, and well &s;ecured. The quantity of provi&s;ion at Fort Schuyler is very inadequate. You will therefore take mea&s;ures, without delay, to convey to that garri&s;on whatever &s;upply the Deputy Commi&s;&s;ary General can furni&s;h, and you will call upon him to know what that is.</P>

A number of bricks will be wanted at Ticonderoga, Fort George and Saratoga; you will therefore take mea&s;ures, the &s;oone&s;t po&s;&s;ible, to get them made. Fort Edward may be &s;upplied with this article from Fort George in returning carriages. Skeen&s;borough and Fort Ann may be &s;upplied in returning batteaus from Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>You will al&s;o give directions for burning lime at Ticonderoga, Fort George and Saratoga, for the u&s;e of the works there, and the places mentioned in the preceding paragraph.</P>

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour to advi&s;e you that I arrived here on Tue&s;day, the third in&s;tant, and found an account, which I received on my way up, that the enemy were approaching Ticonderoga, to be without foundation.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;e you, Sir, a return of the troops at Ticonderoga and this place. As &s;oon as I procure tho&s;e from the other po&s;ts I &s;hall make out a general return, and do my&s;elf the honour to tran&s;mit copies to you and his Excellency General Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>You will perceive by the return of the Commi&s;&s;ary of Provi&s;ions, which I al&s;o inclo&s;e, that only 337 bar|rels of the meat kind have been forwarded to Ticonderoga &s;ince the 26th of March, and no fre&s;h beef, &s;o that the &s;tock of &s;alted provi&s;ions &s;ince that time is con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, nor is there any con&s;iderable quantity provided in the country. I have therefore directed the Commi&s;&s;ary to forward an immediate &s;upply of fre&s;h beef, that as much of the &s;alted beef and pork may be &s;aved as po&s;&s;ible, in order to have a &s;tock on hand, in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould be able &s;o to interrupt the communication as to prevent cattle being &s;ent on.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;e you copy of the in&s;tructions I have given General St. Clair. I have directed that Mount Inde|pendence &s;hould be the primary object of attention. 1<HI>st.</HI> Becau&s;e, if even the lines on the we&s;t &s;ide &s;hould be perfectly compleated, it will not be in our power to man them properly with the whole force de&s;tined for this department, if it could be all collected at Ticonderoga, which it cannot, for the &s;everal po&s;ts on the Mohawk river, and tho&s;e on the communication between this and Ticonderoga, will take at lea&s;t two thou&s;and men. I have in view the drawing part of the army to this &s;ide of the Lake.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> Becau&s;e I think it rather imprudent that the greater part of our army &s;hould occupy a po&s;t, which if the enemy &s;hould be able &s;o to inve&s;t as to cut off the communication with the country on this &s;ide, we might po&s;&s;ibly experience a di&s;a&s;ter &s;imilar to that at Fort Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> Becau&s;e I am fully convinced that between two and three thou&s;and men can effectually maintain Mount Independence, and &s;ecure the pa&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly.</HI> If the whole army was at Mount Independence, it is po&s;&s;ible that a want of provi&s;ion might oblige us to abandon that important po&s;t.</P>

<P>YOU will plea&s;e, without delay, minutely to inform me what advances are made in fortifying Fort Schuy|ler, and al&s;o how that work is conducted. I am advi&s;ed that all the oeconomy is not made u&s;e of that ought to be, and that the Engineer employs a greater number of carriages than are nece&s;&s;ary. Pray be very par|ticular in your report on this head. You will make me an exact return of the troops that compo&s;e your garri|&s;on, and of the artificers and others employed about the works, and to do this monthly. You will keep up a friendly intercour&s;e with the Indians, and &s;uffer no &s;peeches to be made to them by Captain Marqui&s;ie, or any other per&s;on not employed in the Indian Department; and when you have occa&s;ion to &s;peak to them, let your &s;peech be written, and a copy tran&s;mitted to me, that the Commi&s;&s;ioners may be informed of every tran&s;action with tho&s;e people. You will be very careful and attentive to pre&s;erving the health of your garri&s;on, and to their di&s;cipline. Let an officer daily in&s;pect into the cooking, and &s;ee that the uten&s;ils be kept clean. Another to &s;ee that their quarters are kept &s;weet and clean, and their bedding frequently aired. Suffer no officer, non-commi&s;&s;ioned officer or private, to u&s;e any bedding or blankets when on guard, and oblige the officers always to remain with their guards; not mu&s;t your Adjutant bring any per&s;on to the parade for guard, who&s;e hair is not powdered, his per&s;on perfectly clean, his clothes in good order, his arms bright, and accoutrements in compleat order. I wi&s;h your clo&s;e&s;t attention to tho&s;e particulars, and doubt not but you will give it, as it will redound to your credit to introduce good order and di&s;cipline into the corps you have the honour to command.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SENT you an account of the &s;ituation of the people at Unadilla the 10th of this in&s;tant, and have now an opportunity fully to acquaint you of the matter, as Mr. John&s;on of Unadilla has given me a full detail of it, which is as follows: That Jo&s;eph Brandt came to Oui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quago, hoi&s;ted the Briti&s;h flag, and then proceeded to Unadilla with his party, which con&s;i&s;ted of more than one hundred men. Before he made his appearance in Unadilla him&s;elf, he &s;ent one William John&s;on, half brother to Sir John John&s;on, with &s;everal other Indians, to acquaint the people that he was coming with his party, and that they &s;hould not be afraid, as he &s;aid he would be peaceable as vet. When Brandt arrived with his men, he marched to one McGinnis, who is a noted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and &s;ent for Mr. John&s;on, the Mini&s;ter, and Captain John&s;on, his &s;on, who went immediately to him. He a&s;ked the old gentleman &s;everal que&s;tions concerning u&s;ing his friends ill, as they were a free people, who an&s;wered that his friends had been u&s;ed with all the civility of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> people. Brandt replied that he and his party were for the King, and that he did not think proper to fall out for every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; but as he had a large party, and wanted provi&s;ion for them, if the people would let him have it, he would pay for it, letting them know at the &s;ame time that he would have it at any rate; and after getting cattle, &s;heep and &s;wine, and other provi&s;ions, he told the people that Butler would be along &s;oon, and pay for what he had taken from them; that he then appeared there in a warlike manner, and intended to bring off his people in &s;pite of every oppo&s;ition; and further &s;aid, there would be great trouble there &s;oon. When Brandt and his party were about returning to Onioquago, be de&s;ired McGinnis to let the boards he had furni&s;hed them with for c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mps remain as they were until he returned, which would be in a few days, in order to bring his friends from the Mohawk river. It is uncertain when he will return, but he is expected every hour. The tories, who have joined him, &s;ay they are not afraid of the American troops now. They have made a road from the Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quehanna to the De|laware, in order, as we &s;uppo&s;e, that the tories from Katt&s;kill and el&s;ewhere may join them.

Having had &s;ome intimation before I left Albany, that Jo&s;eph Brandt had drove off &s;ome cattle from the we&s;tern frontiers of this State, and threatened the inhabitants, I di&s;patched a me&s;&s;age to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">neidas on that &s;ubject. I have this day &s;ent them a &s;econd me&s;&s;age, couched in &s;uch firm, but, I hope, prudent terms, that I expect it will have the de&s;ired effect, and that we &s;hall have no farther trouble from that fellow and his a&s;&s;ociates. Le&s;t, however, I &s;hould be mi&s;taken in my con|jectures, I have ordered Colonel Van Schaick into that quarter with 150 men, to protect the inhabitants, and have directed him in the line of conduct he is to hold, which is to be &s;uch as not to give umbrage to our Indian allies.</P>
<P>At twelve I received an expre&s;s from General St. Clair, copies of his letters No. 3 and 4, with copy of the letter to General Sullivan No. 5, and of the pa&s;s to Am&s;bury No. 6, I herewith tran&s;mit.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the exten&s;ivene&s;s of our works at Ticonderoga, the &s;mallne&s;s of the garri&s;on is alarming; but I hope that, by confining our whole attention to Mount Independence, we &s;hall be able to hold that pa&s;s again&s;t any effort of the enemy.</P>
<P>Though chagrined, I am not di&s;couraged by the variety of difficulties that pre&s;ent them&s;elves; becau&s;e I am confident that by &s;teady exertions and per&s;everance we &s;hall &s;urmount them, and hope that the enemy will find that we &s;hall be able to prevent them from penetrating the country, &s;hould they attempt it, which I believe they will not do, even if they &s;hould (contrary to my expectations) be able to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of Ticonderoga, unle&s;s General Howe &s;hould penetrate up Hud&s;on's river. I have already di&s;patched an expre&s;s to the States of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and New-Hamp&s;hire, to ha&s;ten on the remainder of their troops, and have given the mo&s;t pointed orders to the Deputy Commi&s;&s;ary and Quarter Ma&s;ter General to furni&s;h what is ne|ce&s;&s;ary in their re&s;pective departments, and as &s;oon as I have brought matters in &s;ome train at Ticonderoga, and the communication above this, I &s;hall ha&s;ten back to pu&s;h on the nece&s;&s;aries, and regulate affairs on the We&s;tern Communication, where al&s;o much di&s;order prevails.</P>
<P>I take the liberty to enclo&s;e this under flying &s;eal to his Excellency the Commander in Chief, as I cannot find time to do my&s;elf the honour to give Congre&s;s and him a &s;eparate detail of what I have written.</P>

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour to inclo&s;e your Excellency a letter to Congre&s;s under flying &s;eal.

<P>Our numbers are &s;o few to the northward, and we have &s;o little pro&s;pect of their encrea&s;ing, that, &s;hould a di&s;a&s;ter befal us at Ticonderoga, we &s;hould have very few troops indeed to oppo&s;e, if the enemy &s;hould make an attempt to penetrate the country. I &s;hall probably be under the nece&s;&s;ity of calling for a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Peek's-Kill.

<P>I HAVE this moment received di&s;patches from General St. Clair, who is at Ticonderoga, advi&s;ing me that by intelligence from Canada a body of the enemy may be expected in a very little while, and another on the Mohawk river; that the militia from New-Hamp&s;hire are gone home; that the troops at Ticonderoga do not amount to more than two thou&s;and two hundred men, &s;ick included; that all the regiments are greatly deficient in numbers. Let me entreat you, Sir, to &s;pare no exertions to ha&s;ten on the troops from your State. Such as can conveniently come by the way of Albany to do it. Every moment's delay is attended with dan|ger, and may perhaps prove fatal to us.</P>

<P>With the&s;e, taking twenty days provi&s;ions, and a &s;ufficiency of ammunition, you will immediately march <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Cherry Valley, de&s;iring the Committee of Tryon county to meet you on the way to that place, of whom you will enquire what place will be mo&s;t eligible to po&s;t the troops in, &s;o as be&s;t to defend the inhabitants from any in&s;ults which may be offered by Jo&s;eph Brandt and his party, or any others.

<P>I have &s;ent one me&s;&s;age to Oneida, and inclo&s;e another, which you will &s;end from Albany by expre&s;s.

If the orders I gave you early la&s;t winter had been complied with, we &s;hould not have laboured under the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s. If my memory &s;erves me (for I have not my books with me) I directed you to lay in provi&s;ions at Ticonderoga, to &s;upport a garri&s;on of three thou&s;and men to the fir&s;t of April, be&s;ides eight months provi&s;ions for five thou&s;and men at Fort George, Fort Ann and Skeen&s;borough, and a like quantity at Albany.</P>
<P>I charge you in the mo&s;t po&s;itive manner to ha&s;ten what &s;alted beef and pork you may have to Albany, or to any of the po&s;ts on Hud&s;on's river, between Albany and Fort Edward, and to procure as many fat cattle as po&s;&s;ible, and to cau&s;e them to be drove to Ticonderoga without delay. If we are obliged to abandon Ticonderoga for want of provi&s;ions, I leave you to judge of the con&s;equences to your&s;elf. <HI>I am, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>I DID my&s;elf the honour to addre&s;s you from Saratoga on the 14th in&s;tant. On the next day Am&s;bury and Adams (mentioned in General St. Clair's letter, copy whereof I tran&s;mitted Congre&s;s by letter under cover to your Excellency) arrived at Saratoga. What pa&s;&s;ed between us, and what information he gave, is noted in the paper, No. 1. No. 2 is the letter which was inclo&s;ed between the two bottoms of the canteen.</P>
<P>If the information which Am&s;bury gives is to be relied upon, as I think it is, we &s;hall &s;oon be attacked at Ticonderoga; and, although I think the forces now there may be &s;ufficient to hold that important po&s;t, I have no troops to oppo&s;e either Sir John John&s;on, if he &s;hould penetrate to the Mohawk river, or any to prevent the communication between this and Fort George from being cut off, nor have I force, if the&s;e &s;hould not be attempted by the enemy, to march to the relief of Ticonderoga. In this &s;ituation, I am under the nece&s;&s;ity of applying to your Excellency for a reinforcement.</P>
<P>Permit me to beg that your Excellency will communicate the contents of this di&s;patch to Congre&s;s, as I cannot find time to do my&s;elf the honour to write them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 17th in&s;tant I arrived at Ticonderoga, where I found General St. Clair, and the other General Officers, a&s;&s;idno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ly employed in the nece&s;&s;ary works. I &s;oon found that much was to be done, and, after having informed my&s;elf of the &s;tate of the fortifications, &s;tores, &amp;c. I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to convene a Coun|cil of the General Officers, and laid before them the propo&s;itions contained in the paper No. 1, which being taken into their con&s;ideration, we came to the re&s;olutions noted in the &s;ame paper.</P>
<P>I was in hopes to have found the po&s;t in a better &s;tate of defence than it is, and the works for ob&s;tructing the pa&s;&s;age to prevent the enemy's naval force from getting into the rear of our fortifications compleated, or, at the very lea&s;t, con&s;iderably more advanced than it unhappily is. That matters have not been carried on with more di&s;patch is in a great mea&s;ure to be imputed to the late arrival of any troops, who could be brought to work with &s;pirit, that the artificers did not come by the time they were ordered, and to a want of working cattle. The latter I have already &s;upplied, and I have &s;ent on an additional number of carpenters, &s;o that the bu&s;ine&s;s will now go on in better train, and I hope with much more &s;pirit, and tru&s;t we &s;hall &s;till be able to put every thing in &s;uch order as to give the enemy a good reception, and, I hope, a repul&s;e, &s;hould they attempt a real attack, which I conjecture will not be &s;oon, if at all, although <HI>I expect they</HI> will approach with their fleet, to keep us in alarm, and to draw our attention from other quarters where they may meditate a real attack.</P>
<P>I left Ticonderoga on Sunday evening, and arrived at Fort George on Monday afternoon; and having, previous to my cro&s;&s;ing the lake, taken mea&s;ures to bring on a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, I had the happine&s;s to &s;end on from Fort George between three and four hundred barrels of beef and pork, &s;o that we have now near &s;ixty days provi&s;ions of the meat kind at Ticonderoga, and flour for near double that time, al&s;o at lea&s;t fifteen hundred barrels now at Fort Edward and Fort George, which will all be at the latter place by the end of this month. A &s;mall quantity of beef and pork is be&s;ides on the way up; but, le&s;t this &s;hould &s;till be an in&s;ufficient quantity in ca&s;e of a &s;iege, and that the &s;alted meat may be hu&s;banded as much as po&s;&s;ible, I have &s;ent Commi&s;&s;ary Yancey with a &s;mall party into the interior part of the country to bring up fat cattle; of which, I am informed, there is a con&s;iderable number, chiefly in the hands of per&s;ons who have purcha&s;ed them to get our paper currency out of their hands. The orders I have given to procure them (copy whereof, No. 2, I do my&s;elf the honour to tran&s;mit) will, if carried into execution, certainly infringe on the civil rights of the inhabitants; but, con&s;idering the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and what kind of people will be mo&s;t affected by them, I hope I &s;hall &s;tand excu&s;ed for this &s;tretch of power. I expect the &s;upply will be &s;peedy; if &s;o, it will eradicate every anxiety on the &s;core of provi&s;ions, at lea&s;t until our numbers con&s;iderably encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>I was very di&s;agreeably di&s;appointed to find the troops of Ticonderoga &s;o mi&s;erably clad and armed, and nothing in &s;tore for them. Many are literally barefooted, and mo&s;t of them ragged. It is not po&s;&s;ible to procure &s;ome cloathing, arms and blankets? Many are al&s;o de&s;titute of the latter.</P>
<P>The tents I &s;ent from Philadelphia came in good time, as there was hardly &s;helter for what troops we have, and that very indifferent.</P>
<P>I have ordered all &s;uch &s;ick as are not likely to recover &s;oon to be conveyed to Fort George in covered boats, which are made for the purpo&s;e. If it had been equally proper to have &s;uffered them to remain, and that they could have been as well provided with vegetables, yet nece&s;&s;ity would have ju&s;tified it, as not one &s;ingle room in the ho&s;pital is yet fini&s;hed, nor will it &s;oon be in a condition to receive a con&s;iderable number of &s;ick.</P>
<P>The corps of artillery not affording even one man to a gun, I have drafted two hundred from the different regiments, but was under the nece&s;&s;ity to promi&s;e &s;uch additional pay as to make it equal to that of the artillery corps, which I hope will meet the approbation of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>One of the &s;chooners at Lake George is launched: She is to carry fourteen guns. Another will be in the lake by the fir&s;t of next month, and the timber for the gallies is hauled to the &s;pot where they are to be built. But the rigging which I ordered up in the winter is not all arrived, nor have we a &s;ufficient number of guns for the&s;e ve&s;&s;els. I tru&s;t, however, I &s;hall &s;till be able to procure both in time.</P>

<P>I HAD the honour to receive your Excellency's favour of the 16th in&s;tant, at Ticonderoga, on Sunday the 24th. It gives me infinite plea&s;ure to learn that your force is becoming &s;o re&s;pectable, as to afford you a

<P>The inclo&s;ed letter and papers to Congre&s;s will advi&s;e your Excellency of the &s;tate of affairs in this de|partment.

If the enemy's object is not to attack Ticonderoga, I &s;u&s;pect their move|ment is intended to cover an attempt on New-Hamp&s;hire, the Mohawk river, or to cut off the communication between Fort George and Fort Edward, or perhaps all three, the more to di&s;tract us and divide our force, by drawing our attention to &s;o many different quarters. I wi&s;h the reinforcement the General Officers at Ticonderoga advi&s;ed me to apply to your Excellency for may be &s;ent the &s;oone&s;t po&s;&s;ible. The garri&s;on, of Fort George is much too weak, and I have not a man to &s;end there, or to make any oppo&s;ition in Tryon county.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favour of the 24th was delivered me la&s;t evening. If the enemy &s;hould not mean a &s;erious attack on your po&s;t, their movement is probably calculated to cover an attempt on New Hamp&s;hire, the Mohawk river, or to cut off the communication between Fort George and Fort Edward, or perhaps all three. I wi&s;h you therefore to keep a &s;mall &s;cout on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the lake, near the road leading from St. John's to New Hamp&s;hire, and others as far we&s;t as the road leading to the north branch of Hud&s;on's river.</P>
<P>I have di&s;patched an expre&s;s to Congre&s;s and General Wa&s;hington, and have entreated the latter to afford as a reinforcement. Pray let nothing be left at the landing, and the batteaus be brought over as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, that your retreat may not be cut off, &s;hould you be unable to maintain your po&s;t. I cannot learn that any troops are arrived at Albany. I &s;hall ha&s;ten to that place to forward on whatever I can, and to be in the way to bring up the militia, if nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>YOUR Excellency's favour of the 20th in&s;tant I had the honour to receive, at Saratoga, in the evening of the 26th.</P>
<P>I am this moment favoured with a letter of the 25th in&s;tant from General St. Clair, copy whereof I here|with tran&s;mit. Should an accident happen to the garri&s;on of Ticonderoga, and General Burgoyne make a pu&s;h to gain the &s;outh part of the lake, I know of no ob&s;tacle to prevent him, as, comparatively &s;peaking, I have not a man to oppo&s;e him. The whole number at the different po&s;ts at and on this &s;ide of the lake, including the garri&s;on of Fort George and Skeen&s;borough, not exceeding &s;even hundred men, and the&s;e I can|not draw away from their &s;everal &s;tations, in every one of which they are already much too weak. It is there|fore highly nece&s;&s;ary that a &s;trong reinforcement &s;hould without delay be &s;ent me. If the &s;loops are not yet &s;ent to bring the troops your Excellency has ordered to be kept in readine&s;s at Peeks-kill, I &s;hall pu&s;h them off without delay.</P>
<P>As it is not probable that we &s;hall in time be &s;upplied with field pieces from the ea&s;tward, I mu&s;t entreat that the reinforcement may bring &s;ome up with them.</P>
<P>I have this moment al&s;o received a letter from Mr. Deane, the Indian Interpreter, extract whereof I inclo&s;e you.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Copy of a letter from James Deane, Interpreter, to Major General Schuyler, dated Albany, June <HI>25, 1777.</HI></NOTE> As the information tallies exactly with what I had before, it leads me to conclude that an irruption will be made from the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>I &s;hall apply for the aid of the militia of this and the neighbouring States, but I fear it will not be very powerful, as many mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be left at home.</P>

<P>YOUR favours of the 12th and 14th in&s;tant found me at Fort Schuyler the 17th, bu&s;y in &s;itting out Thomas and his party to Kaghnawaga. On the morning of the 18th he &s;at out, with a party of five others, and expected to re|turn in thirty days. He will come in at Fort Schuyler, as he thinks it rather un&s;afe to come directly to Ticonderoga from Canada, le&s;t our &s;couts &s;hould mi&s;take him for a party of the enemy. I thought it be&s;t that Thomas &s;hould take five or &s;ix in company, that, &s;hould be make any important di&s;covery upon his way to Kaghnawaga, he might imme|diately detach one or two of his party to give your Honour the &s;peed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t intelligence. Directly after having di&s;patch|ed Thomas and his party, I repaired to Oneida, called a meeting, and delivered your &s;peeches as directed. The Oneidas were of opinion that it would be to no purpo&s;e for them to &s;end a me&s;&s;age to Brandt, as he has long &s;ince publicly declared that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e would never regard any thing they &s;hould &s;ay to him. They have, however, in con&s;equence of your Honour's me&s;&s;age, di&s;patched a party to Omoquago, to prevent their people at that place from joining Brandt's party.

<P>YOUR favour of the 25th in&s;tant is this moment delivered me. It &s;eems as if the enemy mean a real attack on your po&s;t. I &s;hall move the militia of this State as &s;oon as I can collect them, and di&s;patch me&s;|&s;engers to the Ea&s;tern States for as many as they can &s;end. The militia from Tryon county I &s;hall order to be kept in readine&s;s to protect the we&s;tern frontiers, having ju&s;t received intelligence that Sir John John&s;on is on his way to attack us in that quarter.</P>
<P>God ble&s;s and protect you, and the troops under your command. I &s;hall exert my&s;elf to afford you every a&s;&s;i&s;tance I po&s;&s;ibly can.</P>
<P>Your favour of the 26th is ju&s;t come to hand. I have di&s;patched a copy of it to General Wa&s;hington and to the Council of Safety of this &s;tate. The orders for the militia to march up are already expedited.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE the letter which I &s;hewed you this morning, I have received another from General St. Clair, advi&s;ing me that a large party of the enemy had gone up Otter Creek, in order to cut off the communication by Skeen&s;borough, and that another &s;trong body had marched on the we&s;t &s;ide of the lake to cut off Fort George. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary that one half of the militia under your command &s;hould immediately march, with orders to rendezvous at Fort Edward, where I &s;hall be with what continental troops I can collect. Pray urge tho&s;e neare&s;t Fort Edward to repair thither, without waiting for others to come up, as a con&s;iderable quantity of provi&s;ions lie at that po&s;t, and which may be in danger of being lo&s;t, &s;hould the enemy make an attempt on that po&s;t.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t received two letters from General St. Clair, dated Ticonderoga, on the 25th and 26th in|&s;tant. He advices me that the enemy's fleet and army are arrived at Crown-Point; that they have &s;ent &s;trong detachments, one to cut off Fort George, and the other either to &s;urprize Skeen&s;borough, or throw them&s;elves on the communication between that and Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>Our garri&s;on at Ticonderoga is greatly inadequate to the defence of the exten&s;ive works on both &s;ides of the lake, and I have unhappily no troops to reinforce them.</P>
<P>The militia of this &s;tate are called upon, but I cannot expect that they will be numerous, as tho&s;e of the we&s;tern part of the &s;tate are ordered to be ready to march at a moment's warning to oppo&s;e Sir John John&s;on, who is expected to make an irruption on the Mohawk river.</P>
<P>I have written to the Committee of Berk&s;hire, and reque&s;ted them to call upon the adjacent counties and di&s;tricts in that State and in Connecticut. Should the militia turn out with &s;pirit, I am in hopes we &s;hall be able to battle the enemy.</P>
<P>I have reque&s;ted the militia to rendezvous at Fort Ann or Edward, as may be mo&s;t convenient.</P>
<P>Your Excellency will plea&s;e to order tho&s;e from Connecticut by any route you may think be&s;t. I believe by the way of Albany would be as expeditions as any, and more convenient. <HI>I am, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>BY two letters this day received, and within two hours of each other, from General St. Clair, one of the 25th in&s;tant, and another of the 26th, I am advi&s;ed that the enemy's fleet and army are advanced as far as Crown Point; that a very &s;trong party is gone by the way of Otter Creek, to fall in between Ticonderoga and Skeen&s;borough, and that another detachment is marched on the we&s;t &s;ide of Lake George, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to cut off Fort George.</P>
<P>As all the continental troops on this &s;ide of the lakes occupy the &s;everal po&s;ts, and as they do not exceed &s;even hundred men, a number too weak even for the po&s;ts they occupy, I cannot make any oppo&s;ition until the militia come up.

<P>YOU have doubtle&s;s been informed by General St. Clair that a body of the enemy is marched on the we&s;t &s;ide of Lake George, with an intention to attack your po&s;t. You will therefore put your&s;elf in the be&s;t po&s;ture of defence you po&s;&s;ibly can. Let a quantity of provi&s;ion be immediately put into the Fort, and as much water as you can po&s;&s;ibly collect. Employ all hands to throw up lines from the Fort towards the &s;pot where the Regimental Ho&s;pital was to be built, and continue them from thence on the brow of the hill to the Guardhou&s;e. Al&s;o threw up a brea&s;twork from the ea&s;t &s;ide of the fort to the precipice by the low land. This, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the guns from the ve&s;&s;els, will render you perfectly &s;ecure. I have the fulle&s;t confidence that the po&s;t will be defended to the la&s;t. I &s;hall ha&s;ten up to your relief as &s;oon as I can collect any body of troops. Send a tru&s;ty officer with my letter to General St. Clair, and if, on his arrival near the north end of the lake, he apprehends danger on the carrying place, direct him to land about four miles on this &s;ide, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the lake, and cro&s;s the mountains, &s;o as to &s;trike the lake oppo&s;ite Ticonderoga.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. SWART informed me ye&s;terday that you had &s;ent for a quantity of provi&s;ion to Stillwater, to be brought down to this place. As it creates a con&s;iderable extra expence to bring provi&s;ions that are &s;o far ad|vanced on the communication back to this place, you will plea&s;e to advi&s;e me of the rea&s;ons which induced you to the mea&s;ure. He al&s;o informed me, that out of fifty barrels of meat eight were totally &s;poiled. It will therefore be be&s;t that you order it to be examined before it leaves the &s;tores in the country, that the public may not pay the tran&s;portation of what may not be fit for &s;ervice. Plea&s;e to let me know if any of the beef or pork, which is lately come directly to this place, was damaged or not. You will al&s;o let me know what fat cattle have been &s;ent to the different po&s;ts &s;ince the fir&s;t of April.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ary General, in a letter of the 21&s;t in&s;tant, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf as follows:
<Q>I have &s;upplied the main army, and the command at Peek's-Kill, with one hundred and fifty head of fat cattle <HI>per</HI> week, for three weeks pa&s;t from New-England, and not gone into the limits allotted for the &s;upply of the North|ern Department with that article. I dare undertake to &s;ay that that department may be &s;upplied in the &s;ame proportion, which will be five days in &s;even, and the di&s;tance to drive not greater than that to this place.</Q></P>
<P>As no &s;uch &s;upply has been &s;ent on, nor any that I know of &s;ince my return from Philadelphia, you will plea&s;e to inform me of the rea&s;ons, if you have any other than that which you gave me before I went to Ti|conderoga, that they could not be procured, as there were no gra&s;s fed cattle in the country fit for the knife.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received your letter, in an&s;wer to mine of ye&s;terday. I believe the difficulty of procuring cattle at pre&s;ent, is very great, but a &s;ufficient &s;tock of provi&s;ions might have been laid in, if the orders I gave on
<PB N="38" REF="016142_0037_0F9B8E76E63FDAD8">
the 6th of November la&s;t had been complied with; for it was on that day that I wrote the Commi&s;&s;ary General on the &s;ubject, the receipt of which letter he acknowledged.</P>
<P>You labour under a mi&s;take, when you a&s;&s;ert that there was not &s;ufficient &s;ledding to carry up the provi&s;ions. If there had been ten times the quantity, it might have been &s;ent to Fort George and Che&s;hire's; for you can|not but remember that crouds of &s;leds offered daily; that many returned from hence home without a loading; that no provi&s;ion was left in the &s;tores here. Indeed, many of the &s;ledmen complained per&s;onally to me, that they had come to ride, and could get no loading. It is true, that the military che&s;t was not &s;ufficiently &s;up|plied to an&s;wer every demand; but, if my memory fails not, you had a &s;ufficiency to have laid in a &s;tock con&s;iderably beyond what is. I confe&s;s that it would be mortifying to any per&s;on to have the frowns and cen&s;ures of his &s;uperior officer, when he is &s;en&s;ible he has done his duty. But I &s;hould be glad to know in what in&s;tances you have had my frowns. All my letters to you point out to you the rever&s;e. They give you whole&s;ome advice, and direct you what might be proper to do. That the army is &s;o well &s;upplied with flour you know is, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the hints I gave you. That you procured barrels for that flour was in con&s;equence of a plan I &s;truck out for you. I wi&s;h you therefore, nay, I in&s;i&s;t upon your pointing out in what in&s;tance you have not been &s;upported by me, whenever you required my &s;upport. I believe you will not be able to adduce one. I promi&s;ed you my countenance when you came into the office, and you have had it. If I had wi&s;hed that another &s;hould have enjoyed it, I might probably have had it in my power to have obtained it; but, &s;u&s;picious as you are, I will &s;till be candid. I declare that I believe you took &s;uch mea&s;ures as you thought be&s;t to procure a &s;ufficient &s;tock of provi&s;ion. I believe your Agents have greatly deceived you. I believe they made returns of larger quantities than they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. I do not believe that you would have returned &s;o large a quantity to me as you did on the 13th of March, if you had not been deceived; but you ought not to have been deceived. It was faulty in you to be &s;o, and of that I have great rea&s;on to complain. The militia are ordered up, and a body of continental troops are expected from Peek's-Kill. I &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall have &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and additional men to feed. You mu&s;t therefore &s;train every nerve to procure a &s;upply of provi&s;ions. If you want money, &s;end to me for a warrant. Coopers are greatly wanted, both of Fort George and Fort Edward, you &s;hould &s;end one to each po&s;t.</P>

<P>I HAVE received further information that a body of the enemy are on their march to Tryon county, by the way of O&s;wego, and have de&s;ired General Herkimer to hold the militia in readine&s;s to march to the &s;up|port of Fort Schuyler.</P>
<P>I am very apprehen&s;ive that, &s;hould a di&s;a&s;ter befal the garri&s;on of Ticonderoga, the enemy might po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of Fort George before we can be in force to make oppo&s;ition. I wi&s;h therefore, mo&s;t heartily, for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Council of Safety in forwarding on the militia. A Committee from that re&s;pectable body might afford us very material a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Perhaps it would tend much to in&s;pirit the people, if all the State pri&s;oners, except &s;uch as were under &s;entence of death, were removed from this city.</P>

<P>I AM favoured with your letter of the 20th June, which came to hand on my arrival at this place from Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>The enemy have opened the campaign in every quarter in this department. By a letter from General St. Clair, of the 28th ult. their main body and fleet were &s;till at Crown Point, where they had been &s;ome days, and from whence they have &s;ent &s;trong parties to interrupt the communication. If we had a &s;ufficient number of troops at that po&s;t, I &s;hould not be in pain for the event if they made a &s;erious attack; but our numbers are con&s;iderably below half what they ought to be. I am waiting with impatience for the mi|litia, and for a reinforcement from Peek's-Kill, which is expected in a day or two to move up, either to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the garri&s;on, or to cover its retreat, &s;hould &s;uch an event unhappily take place.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of inducing the Six Nations to abide by the neutrality they have promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve is a matter of capital moment. The troops it would require to awe the&s;e people, if they were unfriendly, would create a very con&s;iderable expence, whil&s;t a &s;um, equal to the tenth part of it, properly laid out in pre&s;ents, would have all the de&s;ired effect. A conference is to be held with them at this place on the 15th in&s;tant, and as they inform me that they will generally attend, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the articles nece&s;&s;ary to give them &s;hould be procured without delay. The importance of the bu&s;ine&s;s will apologize for the liberty I take, by entreating your aid to Major Ren&s;&s;elaer, who is expre&s;ly &s;ent to procure &s;uch articles as are indi&s;pen&s;ibly re|qui&s;ite.

<P>The enemy, from &s;ome late manoeuvres, do not appear to be in great force. They have entrenched them|&s;elves, and thrown a boom acro&s;s the lake, at a point of land about three miles north of Ticonderoga.

The importance of keeping the&s;e people to ob&s;erve that neutrality which they have promi&s;ed is &s;o evident, that it needs not to be particularly dwelt upon. Permit me only to ob&s;erve, that one tenth part of the money, nece&s;&s;ary to maintain a force equal to keep them in awe, expended in pre&s;ents, will have the de&s;ired effect. The difficulty is, to procure the articles that are wanted; and as they are not to be got any where but with you, I have &s;ent Major Ren&s;&s;elaer for the purpo&s;e, and mu&s;t earne&s;tly entreat you that you will be plea&s;ed to afford him every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in your power, and to order Major Cha&s;e, the Deputy Quarter Ma&s;ter General, to provide him with carriages, for which he will pay. I have written to the Pre&s;ident of the State, entreating his a&s;&s;i&s;tance al&s;o. Should any of the articles, or any thing as a &s;ub&s;titute, be found in any of the continental &s;tores, you will plea&s;e to order &s;uch to be delivered.</P>
<P>The enemy have approached to within three miles of Ticonderoga, where they are retrenching them&s;elves, and al&s;o are throwing a boom acro&s;s the lake. This does not carry with it an idea that they have any great force. The militia are marching up, and part of the continental troops from Peek's-Kill are momently expected. I &s;hall make all the ha&s;te po&s;&s;ible with them, and hope we &s;hall be able, at lea&s;t, to prevent the enemy from doing any thing capital.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent General Learned to collect the militia at Fort Edward and Fort Ann.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favour of the 30th ult. continued to the fir&s;t in&s;tant, I received about two o'clock ye&s;terday morn|ing, and that of the &s;econd at about one this morning.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="016142_0039_0F9B8E78EEB083C0">If the enemy intend a &s;erious attack, that manoeuvre of retrenching them&s;elves, and throwing a boom acro&s;s the lake, &s;eems very odd. I wi&s;h we could certainly know their numbers.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent a tru&s;ty officer to march a &s;trong body to the quarter you mention. I dare not be more explicit, le&s;t this &s;hould be intercepted, and the enemy derive an advantage from the information. The troops can march and fall in on enemy as you wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>The militia are moving up in great numbers, both from this and the New-England States. I &s;hall &s;et out to-morrow with the reinforcements from Peek's-Kills, which are very con&s;iderable. I &s;hall have great hopes, if General Burgoyne continues in the vicinity of your po&s;t until we get up, and dares ri&s;k an engagement, that we &s;hall give a good account of him.</P>
<P>I have had no account of the preci&s;e number the enemy lo&s;t in Jer&s;ey. I expect an expre&s;s in a day or two from Head Quarters, and as &s;oon as he arrives &s;hall advi&s;e you of the intelligence he brings. I have &s;everal things to &s;ay, but prudence forbids, &amp;c.</P>

<P>YOUR letter of the 2d in&s;tant was delivered me la&s;t night. I am apprehen&s;ive that the agreement you have made with Brandt will not turn out much to our advantage, for although it was prudent not to refu&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> out the Mohawks of the Lower Ca&s;tle go to the Canajoharie Ca&s;tle, yet permitting Mr. Stewart and Mrs. Butler to re&s;ide there, is putting the&s;e people in a way to do more mi&s;chief than they could have done had they been obliged to remain where they were; and as Brandt informed you that he was going to Butler, and propo&s;ed to join in the expedition which he &s;ays is to be carried on again&s;t Fort Schuyler, this ought to have prevented every kind of treaty with him; however, as it is done, we mu&s;t abide by it.</P>
<P>If we act with vigour and &s;pirit, we have nothing to fear, but if once de&s;pondency takes place, the wor&s;t of con&s;equences are to be apprehended. It is therefore incumbent on you to keep up the &s;pirits of the people.</P>

<P>YOUR letter of the 2d in&s;tant was delivered me la&s;t night by Mr. Moore.</P>
<P>As General Herkimer has made an agreement with Brandt, and that the latter is gone or going to Onendoga, I do not apprehend that the inhabitants of Cherry Valley will be in any danger from the Indians, more e&s;pecially as the treaty is to be held here on the 15th in&s;tant, to which the Indians have generally promi&s;ed to come. I &s;hall, however, order Colonel Van Schaick to remain in Tryon county. I cannot but think that he will be more advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted for the protection of the inhabitants at Cana|joharie, on the north &s;ide of the river. I have, however, directed him, on this head, to con&s;ult you and General Herkimer.</P>
<P>I am very &s;orry that &s;uch a de&s;pondency &s;hould have taken place, as to induce you to &s;ay,
<Q>;If not &s;uc|coured, the well affected people of the&s;e frontiers will be left in &s;uch a dilemma, that will render them obliged either to abandon their habitations, or &s;ubmit to the terms of the friends of Great-Britain, <HI>&s;eeing them&s;elves out of the protection of the States of America.</HI></Q></P>
<P>You &s;eem to entertain an idea that the enemy are capable of doing what they plea&s;e; whereas, in fact, there is great rea&s;on to believe that they will not be able to do much. I entreat you to keep up the &s;pirits of the people. Encourage them to &s;tep forth with alacrity, whenever they may be called upon, and our enemies will be ha&s;&s;led in their attempts, and do not &s;uppo&s;e that the United States of America will not afford you protection. I am &s;ure I have been always ready and willing to afford every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power, and hitherto it has been effectual; for no mi&s;chief worth mentioning has as yet been perpetrated in any part of your country, and you may depend upon it, that upon no nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion will you be left without pro|per &s;upport.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I do my&s;elf the honour to tran&s;mit you copy of &s;undry letters and papers received from General St. Clair.</P>
<P>The troops from Peek's-Kill have not yet appeared. I wait their arrival with impatience and anxiety, and &s;hall pu&s;h with them the moment they do; but if they do not arrive by to-morrow, I &s;hall go without them, and do the be&s;t I can with the militia.</P>
<P>The enemy have had a party at Fort Schuyler, who have &s;calped a Captain and Corporal of Gan&s;evoort's regiment. This, with the threatnings of Jo&s;eph Brandt and his party, and the pro&s;pect of the enemy's ap|proach by O&s;wego, greatly di&s;pirits the people of Tryon county, who have called upon me for &s;upport, in &s;uch a manner that I am obliged to leave Colonel Van Schaick's in that quarter, and apprehend that a rein|forcement will &s;oon be required there. If &s;o, I &s;hall be greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, as we are, and with the reinforce|ments coming up will &s;till be, but weak to the northward, a great part of which mu&s;t be employed as convoys to e&s;cort the provi&s;ions from Fort George and Fort Edward to Fort Ann, and thence to Skeen&s;borough and Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>I mentioned in a former letter from Saratoga, that I &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uch an additional quantity of provi&s;ions had arrived by that time, as that the garri&s;on was &s;upplied with near &s;ixty days; but as great part, if not all of what was at the landing is &s;ent back to Fort George, they are much &s;hort of it. I have ordered it to be car|ried
<PB N="41" REF="016142_0040_0F9B8E79A4A224B0">
to Fort Ann. I with it had been conveyed to Ticonderoga in the months of April and May. I a&s;&s;ure you I am far from being at ea&s;e on the &s;core of provi&s;ions, for if we &s;hould not be able to throw in a &s;upply of fat cattle, I fear that we &s;hall not have a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;alt meat in this part of the country. At Fort Schuyler only, twenty-nine thou&s;and odd hundred weight has been condemned.</P>
<P>Mr. Spencer is returned from the Six Nations. He advi&s;es that the meeting at this place will be numerous. The enemy's agents have indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated that we have nothing to give them; that if we get any thing, it mu&s;t come from Heaven; that all our ports are &s;hut up, and that we can neither get in or out. A good u&s;e might be made of this a&s;&s;ertion, if we could give them a tolerable good &s;upply; but the goods I &s;ent for to the ea&s;tward in March la&s;t have come &s;o extravagantly high, that the cargoe is &s;mall indeed, and not one blanket, and very little &s;trouds, two articles, without which every thing el&s;e is con&s;idered as almo&s;t nothing. In this &s;ituation, Mr. Douw and I thought it advi&s;able that another attempt &s;hould be made to procure a &s;up|ply, and I have di&s;patched Major Ren&s;&s;elaer expre&s;s to Bo&s;ton, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">,000 dollars, and letters to the Pre&s;i|dent of the State and General Heath. As this is an expenditure far beyond the intention of Congre&s;s (but merely the re&s;ult of nece&s;&s;ity) I mu&s;t entreat the &s;cu&s;e of Congre&s;s upon it, that, if it &s;hould be di&s;approved, I make take mea&s;ures that neither the public or I may &s;u&s;tain a lo&s;s.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour to tran&s;mit you copies of General St. Clair's letters to me of the 30th of June, continued to the 1&s;t of July, together with copies of tho&s;e of the 2d and 3d in&s;tant, and two papers inclo&s;ed in the la&s;t, all of which are numbered in the order of time I received them.</P>
<P>The troops from Peek's-Kill have not yet appeared. I wait their arrival with anxiety, and the moment they do I &s;hall move with them. If they do not arrive by to-morrow, I go without them, and will do the be&s;t I can with the militia.</P>
<P>The enemy have had a party at Fort Schuyler, who &s;calped a Captain and Corporal of Gan&s;evoort's regi|ment. This, with the threatnings of Jo&s;eph Brandt, a natural &s;on of Sir William John&s;on, who commands a party of about two hundred Indians, and the pro&s;pect of being attacked by the way of O&s;wego, has &s;o di|&s;pirited the inhabitants of Tryon county, that I have been obliged to leave Colonel Van Schaick, who has about one hundred and fifty continental troops with him, in that part of the country, and apprehend that I &s;hall &s;oon be under the nece&s;&s;ity of reinforcing him. If &s;o, I propo&s;e to &s;end him &s;ome of the militia de&s;tined for the northward, that we may keep the continental troops as much together as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;e your Excellency a return of the army at Ticonderoga. Should any accident befal us in that quar|ter, and the troops be lo&s;t, we &s;hall be in a di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, with little el&s;e be&s;ides militia, with not a &s;ingle piece of heavy or light artillery, and not one artillery-man.</P>
<P>If it be po&s;&s;ible, I wi&s;h your Excellency to order as many artillery-men and field-pieces to this quarter as can be &s;pared, with a competent quantity of fixed ammunition, as we have no cannon cartridge paper, and very little of any other.</P>
<P>As part of the provi&s;ions I &s;ent by the way of Lake George is returned to that po&s;t, I &s;hall now be under the nece&s;&s;ity of drawing it from thence to Fort Ann, that we may attempt to &s;upply the garri&s;on of Ticonde|roga by the way of Wood Creek and Skeen&s;borough; but &s;hould we be incapable of getting a &s;upply of fre&s;h provi&s;ions into that fortre&s;s, I dread the con&s;equences, as the hopes I have of obtaining any con&s;iderable quantity of &s;alted meat are next to none, unle&s;s it can be &s;ent from below, a good deal of what was in this department being &s;poiled.</P>

</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>From the aforegoing facts and papers I humbly conceive the Court will clearly perceive, that during the whole time of my command, prior to the evacuation, I was guilty of no neglect of duty, either in not tran&s;|mitting information to Congre&s;s, preparing for the campaign of 1777, obtaining intelligence of the enemy's de&s;igns, or pur&s;uing every mea&s;ure in my power for rendering them abortive. Should you, Gentlemen, be of this opinion, I pre&s;ume a &s;uppo&s;ition of my having neglected my duty in the in&s;tance charged again&s;t me will not be &s;o ea&s;ily admitted, as if my prior attention had been le&s;s exten&s;ive and unremitted.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to the &s;econd thing propo&s;ed, viz. To lay before the Court the rea&s;ons of my ab&s;ence from Ticonderoga at the time of the &s;iege.&mdash;They are as follow:</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> I did not then, nor can I now, think it the duty of a Commander in Chief of an exten&s;ive Depart|ment ever to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be ble&s;ieged in a &s;ort.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d.</HI> I did not apprehend it to have been the de&s;ire, or even wi&s;h of Congre&s;s, that I &s;hould have remained in the garri&s;on of Ticonderoga at the time of the &s;iege.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d.</HI> The particular and various circum&s;tances and exigencies of the department did at that time call for my care and attention, and con&s;equences capitally injurious to the public good would have en&s;ued, had I been at Ticonderoga during the &s;iege.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> That Commanders in Chief &s;hould not permit them&s;elves to be be&s;ieged in a fort appears &s;o &s;triking and evident, that I am at a lo&s;s to adduce rea&s;ons for rendering it more clear.</P>
<P>When it is con&s;idered that there may be and generally are in every department various po&s;ts and pa&s;&s;es, all of which demand his care; that occa&s;ional aid is to be afforded, in proportion to their re&s;pective nece&s;&s;i|ties; that the operations of the enemy may frequently render new di&s;po&s;itions nece&s;&s;ary, and that applications from every quarter of the department mu&s;t be made to him; I think he would merit cen&s;ure were he to con|fine his care to a &s;ingle garri&s;on, lock him&s;elf up in it, and, during the cour&s;e of perhaps a long &s;iege, de|prive the remainder of the department of his &s;uperintendence.</P>
<P>The propriety of this rea&s;oning receives additional force from general practice. I am ignorant of any in|&s;tances of Commanders in Chief having acted this part. The pre&s;ent war affords numerous in&s;tances to the contrary.</P>
<P>His Excellency General Wa&s;hington never &s;uffered him&s;elf to be be&s;ieged. What would have been the con&s;equence had be taken the command of Fort Wa&s;hington? His abilities perhaps might have &s;aved it, but it might even then have been lo&s;t, and &s;urely it was not his duty to have run the ri&s;que. His per&s;onal valour, as well as good conduct, &s;tands confe&s;&s;ed, and yet he never thought him&s;elf ju&s;tifiable to take &s;uch a &s;tep. I would not here be &s;uppo&s;ed to compare my&s;elf, in point of importance, to that great and good man. I mean nothing further by this, than to repre&s;ent the impropriety of &s;uch conduct in a Commander in Chief in a &s;tronger light.</P>
<P>It is well known that the command of &s;orts is generally given to &s;ubordinate officers; and as the object of the appointment of a Commander in Chief is the good of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hole department, it would, in my opinion, be repugnant to the de&s;ign of his appointment, to put him&s;elf in &s;uch a &s;ituation as to be able to extend his care no further than the walls of one &s;ingle fort in it. On the contrary, &s;hould be not leave him&s;elf at large, to concert and execute mea&s;ures for the relief of &s;uch po&s;ts as may be in danger, to afford them &s;uccours, to annoy the enemy, to cut off their retreat, to intercept their &s;upplies, and generally to do every thing, which, in his opinion, may be calculated to fru&s;trate their de&s;igns?</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> Had I received the lea&s;t intimation that it was the de&s;ire of Congre&s;s that I &s;hould take the command of Ticonderoga, I &s;hould, without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, have done it, but &s;uch intimation was never given me. On the contrary be&s;ides the rea&s;ons above mentioned, I had particular ones, which induced me to believe that they neither expected or de&s;ired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</P>
<P>Ticonderoga has been deemed an important po&s;t ever &s;ince the war, and when it became mo&s;t &s;o, Congre&s;s was plea&s;ed to name the officer who they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould command at it.</P>
<P>On the 7th of March, 1776. Congre&s;s re&s;olved that I &s;hould for the pre&s;ent, or until I &s;hould receive farther orders, &s;ix my Head-Quarters at Albany.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="016142_0042_0F9B8E7DC2498A70">And although in the fall following the enemy appeared in force in the vicinity of Ticonderoga under General Carleton, and apparently with de&s;ign to inve&s;t it, yet the above order remained unrepealed, and the immediate command of that po&s;t was committed to another officer.</P>
<P>Nor were the&s;e orders annulled till the 22d of May, 1777, in con&s;equence of my repre&s;enting to Congre&s;s the impracticability of my paying proper attention to the department, during the continuance of that re&s;triction.</P>
<P>On the 29th of April, 1777, the Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed the following re&s;olution:</P>
<P>"<HI>Ordered,</HI> That General St. Clair be informed by expre&s;s of the approach of the enemy to Ticonderoga, "and that he repair without lo&s;s of time to that place.</P>
<P>As General St. Clair was at that time one of the officers de&s;igned for the Northern Department, and of cour&s;e under my command, the above order receives all its propriety and u&s;e, from a &s;uppo&s;ition that I &s;hould not remain with the garri&s;on in ca&s;e of a &s;iege.</P>
<P>At no time, during my command in that department, did I ever intimate a de&s;ign of taking the particular command of that po&s;t. Indeed, I had informed Congre&s;s, as the Court will perceive by my letter of the 14th of June, already quoted, that
<Q>as &s;oon as matters were brought into &s;ome train at Ticonderoga, and on the communication above, that I &s;hould ha&s;ten back to pu&s;h on the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, and regulate affairs on the We&s;tern Communication, where al&s;o much di&s;order prevailed.</Q>
As this letter was di&s;patched by expre&s;s, and as it inclo&s;ed General St. Clair's letter of the 13th of June, if Congre&s;s had intended that I &s;hould have remained at Ticonderoga, it is rea&s;onable to conclude that they would have given me orders for the purpo&s;e. Nor do any letters or re&s;olves I have been honoured with from Congre&s;s hint &s;uch an expectation. Shortly before, and at the time of the &s;iege, I tran&s;mitted &s;everal letters from General St. Clair to Congre&s;s, by which they were informed of the enemy's progre&s;s; and I al&s;o informed Congre&s;s of my in|tention (not to command the garri&s;on) but to put my&s;elf at the head of all the troops and militia I could collect, and do my utmo&s;t to rai&s;e the &s;iege. From the above circum&s;tances therefore, and from the &s;ilence of Congre&s;s re&s;pecting a de&s;ire that I &s;hould confine my&s;elf to the fort, I had not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to infer that they wi&s;hed it, or that they were di&s;plea&s;ed with my ab&s;ence. About this time a treaty with the Indians was to be held, the &s;ecurity of Fort Schuyler to be provided for, the incur&s;ions of the Indians on the we&s;tern fron|tiers to be oppo&s;ed, a long chain of communication to be kept open, the militia to be collected, &s;upplies to the different po&s;ts to be forwarded, and my utmo&s;t exertions throughout the whole department required. I mu&s;t therefore &s;ubmit it to you, Gentlemen, whether I had any rea&s;on to conjecture that Congre&s;s expected I would confine my&s;elf at Ticonderoga, and thereby &s;ubject my&s;elf to the nece&s;&s;ity of neglecting tho&s;e other very important objects, e&s;pecially too as an officer of reputation, nominated by them to command at Ticon|deroga, was then at that po&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> The particular and various circum&s;tances and exigencies of the department did at that time call for my care and attention, and that con&s;equences very injurious to the public good would have en&s;ued, had I been at Ticonderoga during the &s;iege.</P>
<P>Permit me to remind you, Gentlemen, that Ticonderoga, Crown Point, Fort George, Fort Schuyler, Al|bany, and various other po&s;ts, are included in the Northern Department, and then under my command; that an expedition was then carrying on again&s;t Ticonderoga by General Burgoyne; another again&s;t Fort Schuyler by General St. Leger; and a third by a party of &s;avages again&s;t the we&s;tern &s;ettlements of this State; that, to e&s;tabli&s;h a communication for the pa&s;&s;age of &s;upplies from Albany and the interior country to Ticonderoga, a chain of po&s;ts was to be maintained, which chain con&s;i&s;ted of the following po&s;ts, Half Moon, Stillwater, Saratoga, Fort Miller, Fort Edward, Fort George, Fort Ann and Skeen&s;borough; that a like chain of po&s;ts was nece&s;&s;ary to be maintained to the we&s;tward, to &s;ecure a communication with Fort Schuyler, viz. Schenec|tady, Fort John&s;on and Fort Dayton. At all the&s;e po&s;ts troops were &s;tationed, and care to be taken to prevent any of them from being &s;urprized; it being evident that the lo&s;s of one of the&s;e po&s;ts would have broken the whole communication, and have &s;topped the progre&s;s of &s;upplies too important to be ri&s;qued in that critical &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>It will be unnece&s;&s;ary here to mention the frequent applications made to me for &s;uccour from the we&s;tern country, I mean from Cherry Valley, Umadilla, Schohary, Canajoharie, German Flatts, and Fort Schuyler, which was afterwards relieved by a detachment I &s;ent under General Arnold for that purpo&s;e, &s;ome of which places were in danger, others had &s;uffered, and all in the greate&s;t con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ernation, as will appear by &s;undry papers which I &s;hall have the honour to lay before the Court.</P>
<P>The fate of &s;ort Schuyler, as well as Ticonderoga, was precarious. In ca&s;e of the reduction of either, mea&s;ures were to be taken for oppo&s;ing the victorious army, and the &s;y&s;tem of that oppo&s;ition was to depend on events and circum&s;tances, then only to be conjectured.</P>
<P>Pacific, as well as ho&s;tile mea&s;ures, to avoid the depredations of the &s;avages, were then in agitation, a treaty was to be held, me&s;&s;ages were to be &s;ent and received, agents to be employed and in&s;tructed, &s;peeches to be made and an&s;wered, pre&s;ents to be collected and di&s;tributed. Add to this, that there was not a general officer in the department, who had a competent knowledge of that exten&s;ive country, immediately to direct the military operations in it. With what propriety could I throw my&s;elf into Ticonderoga, and, as it were, abandon tho&s;e numerous and e&s;&s;ential objects?</P>
<P>Had I remained with the garri&s;on of Ticonderoga, the valuable &s;tores at Fort George would have been lo&s;t, a competent &s;upply of provi&s;ions for Fort Schuyler would not have been afforded, for although I had given or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers for it immediately on my re&s;uming the command, it was not done till after the 20th of July, as ap|pears by Colonel Gan&s;evoort's letter of that date, and then by my expre&s;s orders. The militia of this State would not have been &s;o &s;oon collected or the cattle and carriages in the reach of the enemy removed. The ob&s;tructions in the navigation of Wood Creek, and of the roads into the country (which was done before General St. Clair and the garri&s;on came up) whereby the progre&s;s of the enemy was greatly retarded, might not have been effected, nor would the country &s;o &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> have been put into a po&s;ture of defence.</P>
<P>The papers which I have la&s;t quoted, I tru&s;t, wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> evince &s;uch a con&s;tant attention to the duties of my office, and &s;uch a degree of anxiety for the public weal, as could only flow from a heart deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the love of its country; and may I be permitted to ob&s;erve, that, notwith&s;tanding the Committee ap|pointed
<PB N="44" REF="016142_0043_0F9B8DD2B0AAE490">
by the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of the 29th of July, 1777, were charged to make the mo&s;t critical enquiry, in order to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es of the misfortunes in the Northern Department, and that in obedi|ence to the orders of Congre&s;s, and in conformity to their duty, they publi&s;hed the re&s;olutions in the news|papers, and in the &s;ame public manner called upon every per&s;on capable of giving information to do &s;o, wrote to the &s;everal officers in the Northern Department, and to the &s;everal Executive Powers of this and the Ea&s;tern States, to afford their aid in procuring information, and as the charge of my not being at Ticonderoga is founded on a fact which was notorious, which Congre&s;s were fully informed of, previous to that re&s;olution, it affords &s;trong pre&s;umptive proof that the Committee received no information on which they could ground any charge, and authorizes the conclu&s;ion, that if I erred in judgment, in not being at Ticonderoga during the &s;iege, it was by no means an intentional neglect of duty. Indeed, I have every rea&s;on to believe, from the confidence which Congre&s;s have been plea&s;ed to place in me after I was la&s;t &s;uperceded in the command of the Northern Department, in&s;tances of which I &s;hall beg leave to produce, that that Honourable Body does not con&s;ider me either as a criminal, or even unworthy &s;ervant of the public. I hope al&s;o to evince to the Court, that, although extremely wounded in my feelings to be deprived of the command in the moment when there was a pro&s;pect of acquiring great reputation, I continued in that line of conduct which I conceived it to be the duty of every good man to hold to his country, however highly that country may have injured him; and for that purpo&s;e I &s;hall beg leave to read &s;ome letters and papers, for the information of the Court, after having laid before them &s;undry applications that were made me from different quarters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Papers read were:</P>

You will proceed with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch to Springfield, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in bringing tho&s;e &s;tores on, and any other that may be wanted or ordered this way. Lieutenant Inger&s;ole is to accompany you, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in executing this bu&s;ine&s;s. All officers in the &s;ervice of the United States are required, and all civil officers entreated, to give you the mo&s;t effectual aid, to convey the &s;tores you are &s;ent for in the mo&s;t expeditious manner to the army.</P>

<P>If the enemy give me a little time, and I believe nece&s;&s;ity will oblige them to do that, we &s;hall, I tru&s;t, put our&s;elves into &s;uch a po&s;ture as will prevent them from going down the country.

<P>I am extremely apprehen&s;ive that the greate&s;t part of the garri&s;ons of Ticonderoga and Mount Independ|ence are in the enemy's power, and if they make a pu&s;h they may do what they plea&s;e, as I have not above 700 continental troops to oppo&s;e them with, and I fear not above twice that number of militia. I cannot doubt but that we have lo&s;t every piece of cannon we had there, &s;o that I am now left with a few &s;mall pieces, not a &s;ufficient number even for the two &s;mall &s;chooners on Lake George.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM this moment favoured with your Excellency's letter of the 6th in&s;tant. You will before this have received my &s;everal letters, advi&s;ing your Excellency of the evacuation of Ticonderoga, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation we are in. We are by no means now in a better, rather wor&s;e, as de&s;ertion is frequent. General Nixon's brigade is not yet come up, nor do I get a reinforcement of the militia. General St. Clair, from whom I have heard for the fir&s;t time about ten this morning (copy of his letter I inclo&s;e) is about fifty miles ea&s;t of me. If he &s;hould go to Bennington, as I fear he will be obliged to do, he will be &s;till farther off, and the more he gets into the inhabited part of the country, the greater will the de&s;ertion from the army be, which is already much, very much dimini&s;hed, by numbers going off. I am very apprehen&s;ive General St. Clair will not join me with more than one thou&s;and men. General Nixon's corps, I am informed, is under that. Thus, with le&s;s than three thou&s;and continental and not quite one thou&s;and militia, I am to face a powerful enemy from the north, flu&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s, and pre&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time from the we&s;t by a body, which, from repeated information (copies whereof I have not time to &s;end), is re&s;pectable, and already at O&s;wego.</P>
<P>We have &s;till &s;tores of &s;uch importance left at Fort George, that I am very anxious to bring them off be|fore I order that po&s;t to be abandoned, which I mu&s;t do, or &s;uffer the garri&s;on to fall into the enemy's hands, which it inevitably will, if the enemy, who are approaching by Wood Creek, throw them&s;elves between this and Lake George.</P>
<P>I have brought away about twenty pieces of artillery from Lake George, together with nearly all the powder, amounting to about thirteen tons.</P>
<P>General Fellows, with a &s;mall body of militia, but all I could get, are breaking up the road between this and Fort Ann, and felling trees into it. I will throw every ob&s;tacle in their route I po&s;&s;ibly can, and retard their progre&s;s as much as po&s;&s;ible. For this purpo&s;e, I &s;hall di&s;engage my&s;elf of every thing cumber&s;ome, the artillery e&s;pecially, as I can make no u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Permit me to a&s;&s;ure your Excellency, that I &s;hall make every re&s;i&s;tance I po&s;&s;ibly can, and that nothing &s;hall be left undone to prevent the enemy from penetrating farther in the country.</P>

<P>YOUR letter of the 10th in&s;tant I have received. The information that four or five hundred Indians were on their way to New-Perth is totally groundle&s;s. There are not even any &s;o high up Wood Creek as Fort Ann, where we have a large body of troops. If it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end troops to White Creek, I would mo&s;t readily do it. My care &s;hall be extended to every quarter, and if my countrymen will &s;upport me with vigour and activity, we &s;hall be able to prevent the enemy from penetrating much farther into the country; but if they &s;uffer their &s;pirits to &s;ink, and meanly de&s;pond, the word of con&s;equences are to be apprehended.</P>

<P>The enemy's view, in offering protection, is only to prevent the inhabitants from acting &s;piritedly; to get into the country, and, when once there, to plunder indi&s;criminately, as well tho&s;e that may have relied on their promi&s;es, as tho&s;e that have gloriou&s;ly &s;tepped forth for the defence of their country, and tho&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings which they can only enjoy by having that country free.

To them therefore he refers you, as he doubts not, &s;hould they be convinced of the expediency of that body's marching to Cherry Valley, but that they will advi&s;e that mea&s;ure for your protection. <HI>I am, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with your favour of the 11th in&s;tant. The contents give me great &s;atisfaction. However painful it is to labour under a load of calumny, I have, thank God, fortitude enough not to &s;ink under it, nor &s;hall it di&s;tre&s;s my &s;pirits, or make me for one moment relax tho&s;e exertions which are become &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary to prevent the enemy from penetrating much farther into the country, which, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, I hope &s;till to do. Perhaps, Sir, it may be as well, if even the evacuation of Ticonderoga was an unwi&s;e mea&s;ure, not to deprecate it too much, le&s;t it &s;hould encrea&s;e our difficulties, and God knows I have a choice of them, and yet I am &s;upported by a pre&s;entiment that we &s;hall &s;till have a merry Chri&s;tmas.</P>

<P>I WISH to extend my care and attention to every part of the country, and afford a&s;&s;i&s;tance wherever it is wanted; but I am very weak here, and the enemy, as I am informed, are gone to Ticonderoga, to come through Lake George.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are collecting our army; its &s;pirits are recovering. Pray &s;end us whatever you can think of for an army that has nothing, except provi&s;ion. Our whole train of artillery con&s;i&s;ts of two iron field pieces. The whole of our lead le&s;s than three tons, only about fifteen reams of cartridge paper. In great want of blankets, camp kettles, arms, cloathing of every kind, rum, coffee, chocolate, &s;ugar; axes we have very few, and none to be had in the country.</P>
<P>Many of our troops have de&s;erted. I wi&s;h you to apply to the Legi&s;lature of the State, and reque&s;t them to adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures as will bring them back. The enemy are at Skeen&s;borough. Our advanced po&s;ts are at Fort George and Fort Ann. We propo&s;e to remain here, and at a po&s;t about four miles below this.</P>
<P>Our whole &s;trength does not exceed four thou&s;and four hundred men, including General Nixon's brigade, which con&s;i&s;ts of no more than five hundred and &s;eventy-five effectives, rank and file, and eleven &s;ick. <HI>I am, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>I AM favoured with your's of ye&s;terday. Inclo&s;e you an order for what cloathing can be procured at Al|bany, which mu&s;t be &s;ent for. I have made a temporary appointment of Mr. Lyons to be your Pay Ma&s;ter, and have given him four thou&s;and dollars, which is all I can at pre&s;ent &s;pare. Colonel Simmonds, with four or five hundred of his regiment, will join your's; but let the others come this way. We are informed the enemy are gone to Ticonderoga, to come by the way of Fort George, becau&s;e they find it rather difficult to penetrate by the way of Skeen&s;borough. Secure all the cattle and carriages you can. Much depends upon preventing them from getting &s;upplies of that kind. Advance as near to the enemy as you po&s;&s;ibly can. Secure all tories, and &s;end them to the interior part of the country. Be vigilant; a &s;urpri&s;e is inexcu&s;able. Thank the troops, in my name, for behaving &s;o well as you &s;ay they did at Hubbarton. A&s;&s;ure them that I will get whatever I can to make them comfortable. All of your regiment that were here are already on the way to join you. If we act vigorou&s;ly, we &s;ave the country. Why &s;hould we de&s;pond? Greater misfortunes have happened, and have been retrieved. Cheer up the &s;pirits of the people in your quarter.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BOTH your letters of this day have been delivered me.</P>
<P>I am quite in opinion with you and General Fellows, that de&s;troying the cau&s;eway will be a very material ob&s;truction to the enemy's march. I beg therefore that you will do it in the mo&s;t effectual manner, as I hope that of &s;elling trees acro&s;s the road is done; but unle&s;s both roads are compleatly &s;topped, it will be of little avail. You will therefore plea&s;e, as &s;oon as that which leads by Jones's is done, to go upon that which leads pa&s;t Huffnagel's, and &s;top that al&s;o.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve by my orders to General Fellows, that he was directed to &s;end parties to the different farm hou&s;es, to drive off all the cattle. This you will plea&s;e to do without exception, leaving only the milch cows with &s;uch families as cannot move off.</P>
<P>You will al&s;o bring away the &s;cows, and all the iron work from Jones's and Huffnagel's mills, or &s;ee they do it them&s;elves, that the enemy may not have the advantage of tho&s;e mills.</P>
<P>Pray keep out &s;couts continually, and order them to go as far beyond Fort Ann as po&s;&s;ible. When you have compleatly carried into execution what is hereby directed, you will advi&s;e me thereof, that I may give directions or your future de&s;tination.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT gives me great pain that I am not in a capacity directly to an&s;wer your letter of the 15th in&s;tant. As an officer of the Honourable the Congre&s;s, who repre&s;ent the Thirteen United States of America. I cannot with propriety take notice of a Fourteenth State, unknown in their Confederacy. In order that the public &s;ervice may not &s;uffer, I &s;hall however an&s;wer your letter, which, for the rea&s;ons already a&s;&s;igned, I am under the nece&s;&s;ity of doing in your private capacity.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="016142_0050_0F9B8E841F787908">That the enemy &s;hould fortify at Ca&s;tle-Town is to me exceeding unaccountable. It is certain that a con&s;iderable body of their troops with General Burgoyne are at Skeen&s;borough; that, from corroborated in|formation, a body of them are gone to Ticonderoga, to come by the way of Lake George.</P>
<P>It is, doubtle&s;s, extremely difficult to move the inhabitants that lie neare&s;t the enemy, but I &s;hould hope that Colonel Warner, &s;upported by the militia under Colonel Simmonds, which I have ordered to join him, and with that of the State of New-Hamp&s;hire, and &s;uch as can be collected from the more &s;outhern parts of what are commonly called the Grants, would be able to effect this bu&s;ine&s;s in a very great mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The enemy, by the be&s;t accounts, are not above &s;ix thou&s;and; and, if it be true that they are di&s;po&s;ed of as I have mentioned, the body at Ca&s;tle-Town cannot be con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>I have ordered &s;uch per&s;ons as are going to the enemy for protections to be &s;eized, and &s;ent pri&s;oners to me. Three have been delivered to me, and I have &s;ent them to goal in Albany. I think it would be right to adopt a &s;imilar conduct, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who are not yet &s;o much in their power as to be obliged to ac|cept protection from them.</P>
<P>I have delivered Captain Fitch a proclamation, of which I wi&s;h you to make copies, and di&s;tribute them in the country neare&s;t the enemy.</P>

<P>I AM this moment informed by Captain Fitch, that the New-Hamp&s;hire militia are marching to join me.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with your letter of the 17th in&s;tant, and the papers it inclo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of Colonel Harper's and Mr. John&s;on's information had been tran&s;mitted about a month ago; in con&s;equence whereof I &s;ent Colonel Van Schaick into Tryon county, with as many troops as I could collect. After the improper agreement made by General Herkimer, the&s;e troops marched back; but as &s;oon as I was informed of their march, I ordered them to remain in Tryon county, where they are &s;till, and I have &s;eat up Colonel We&s;ion's continental regiment to reinforce the&s;e; but, if I may be allowed to judge of the temper of General Herkimer and the Committee of Tryon county from their letters to me, nothing will &s;atisfy them, unle&s;s I march the whole army into that quarter.</P>
<P>With deference to the better judgment of the Council of Safety, I cannot, by any means, think it prudent to bring on an open rupture with the &s;avages at this time. The inhabitants of Tryon county, as you will have perceived by copy of &s;ome letters which I have had the honour to tran&s;mit you, are already too much inclined to lay down their arms, and <HI>take what terms the enemy may plea&s;e to afford them.</HI> Half of the mi|litia from this county, and the neighbouring State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, we have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing, le&s;t the whole &s;hould go, and I believe what are left will only remain a few days. The continental troops I have in this quarter are under three thou&s;and, and the enemy encrea&s;ing with tories, who daily join them in very con&s;iderable numbers. Should we, in this &s;ituation, precipitate a rupture with the Indians, we &s;hould probably involve our&s;elves in the mo&s;t inextricable difficulties. If I &s;hould a&s;k the Indians for leave to build a fort at Onioquago, I am very certain that they would refu&s;e me, and prejudice us in their minds. I have hopes that they will meet me at Albany in a week or two. If they do, I &s;hall be under no apprehen|&s;ions that they will join again&s;t us.</P>

<P>YOUR letter of the 26th in&s;tant I have this moment received. It was extremely mortifying to me, that we were under the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;charging part of the militia, but I believe it will be confe&s;&s;ed that it was much better to keep a part than to have lo&s;t the whole, which would certainly have been the ca&s;e. As I am to have no farther reinforcements of continental troops than General Glover's brigade, every militia-man that can be got &s;hould be &s;ent up. I have written to Governor Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll for at lea&s;t two thou&s;and from Con|necticut. Application has been made to the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and I do now reque&s;t of the Council of Safety, that they will be plea&s;ed to take mea&s;ures to &s;end as many from this State as can be procured, and to be engaged for a determinate time. Tho&s;e now with me are dimini&s;hing fa&s;t, and not one of them will remain more than a for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">night.</P>
<P>It is very true, that, in direct violation of the contract with the carpenters, their tools were taken from them. I mu&s;t confe&s;s too that it was done by my order, and I tru&s;t the Council of Safety will think I did what was perfectly right. We had not a carpenter's tool left in this department, our whole &s;tock having been lo&s;t at Ticonderoga. I had gun carriages to make, and others to mend, a bridge to throw over Hud&s;on's River, for the &s;ecurity of the country, and all that variety of carpentry to be done, which is ever nece&s;&s;ary with an army. In &s;hort, Sir, I labour under a thou&s;and difficulties at pre&s;ent for want of a &s;ufficiency of tools. Their complaint that the tools were taken from them is ju&s;t. They are to be paid for them; but I cannot remove the cau&s;e by re&s;toring the tools, without &s;acrificing the country.</P>

<P>I wi&s;h people to con&s;ider that we have had a larger body of enemy on this &s;ide of Lake George, when Fort William-Henry was taken; that the Briti&s;h troops were on the point of retiring from Fort Edward; and that many concluded the country was lo&s;t. A little reflection convinced that the danger was not &s;o great as they at fir&s;t imagined, and they re&s;umed their &s;pirits. I hope they will do &s;o now. I wi&s;h them to con&s;ider, that if General Burgoyne &s;hould even got as far down as Half-Moon, that he will run him&s;elf into the greate&s;t dan|ger, and that in all probability his whole army will be de&s;troyed.

<P>COLONEL WARNER is on the Grants with a &s;mall body of continental troops, &s;ome militia, and expects to be reinforced in a day or two by General Stark, with a body of Militia from New-Hamp&s;hire. You will plea&s;e to repair to Manche&s;ter, the place where the troops above mentioned are collected and collect|ing, and take the command of the whole. As General Burgoyne is advancing towards us, and a movement of a body of troops from the Grants towards Skeen&s;borough will doubtle&s;s much embarra&s;s him, and will certainly oblige him to leave a con&s;iderable force at that place, you will move towards it, if the troops you &s;hould find there, or tho&s;e that may join, are in &s;uch numbers as that you can do it without ri&s;king too much.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to advi&s;e me from time to time of your &s;ituation and force, that I may be enabled to direct your future operations according to what information I may get of the enemy's intentions.

<P>I HAVE this moment received your letter of ye&s;terday's date. The information you gave me made me blu&s;h for my countrymen.</P>
<P>Is it becoming rational beings, when a misfortune has happened to them, to de&s;pond, and not to counteract the evil? Surely not; and if the militia would do their duty, we &s;hould &s;oon make the enemy repent their ever having come into the country, and retreat with infinitely more lo&s;s than we have experienced; but if the militia will &s;it &s;till, folding their hands, and not make u&s;e of tho&s;e exertions which God has put it in their power to make u&s;e of for their own defence, they certainly will become the victims of an enemy, who&s;e very mercies are cruelty.

<P>I RETURNED here la&s;t night to meet &s;ome Indians, who are deputed to me on bu&s;ine&s;s which they are to di&s;clo&s;e at twelve to-day. Our army is at Stillwater, twenty-two miles north of this, where we wi&s;h to make a &s;tand, and will do it, if &s;upported by militia, none of which are yet arrived, nor any on the march. General Burgoyne's head-quarters were at Fort Edward on the fourth in&s;tant, and I am informed that he pro|po&s;es moving down in a few days. Great &s;ickne&s;s begins to prevail in our army, chiefly occa&s;ioned, I believe, by living altogether on fre&s;h meat, we not having had any &s;alted meat for about twenty days pa&s;t, there being next to none, nor any to be procured. The very little we have is kept for &s;couting parties.</P>
<P>At &s;ix this morning an expre&s;s arrived from Tryon county, advi&s;ing me
<Q>That General Herkimer march|ed on the 3d in&s;tant to &s;upport the garri&s;on at Fort Schuyler; that on Wedne&s;day, between Ori&s;ko and the fort, the militia were attacked, and, according to the information received, the militia entirely cut to pieces, the General killed, with mo&s;t of the field officers. The number of the enemy that ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the attack is no wi&s;e a&s;certained, but are thought to be very numerous. The fort, by all the accounts received, was attacked before the militia marched, but in what manner we know not; whether by Indians firing with &s;mall arms at a di&s;tance, to confine our people within the fort, or whether their main body was near ad|vanced or not, I cannot &s;ay; therefore hope you will immediately &s;end a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or this quarter mu&s;t of cour&s;e fall into the enemy's hands, as the whole of the militia was in the engagement, except a few guards that were &s;tationed in different places.</Q>
This from Lieut. Col. Deygert of the militia, and I have not had a line from any one el&s;e on the &s;ubject. The garri&s;on, as the Deputy Commi&s;&s;ary General informs me in a letter of the 4th in&s;tant, is provided with 500 barrel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of flour, 60 barrels of &s;alted provi&s;ions, a con&s;iderable quantity of pea&s;e, twenty head of fat cattle that lately arrived there, and the inhabitants round the fort have near fifty head, and that Colonel Gan&s;evoort had them in charge.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT gives me great &s;atisfaction that you have offered to go and conduct the military operations in Tryon county. You will plea&s;e to repair thither with all convenient &s;peed, and take upon you the command of all the continental troops, and &s;uch of the militia as you can prevail upon to join your troops. Fort Schuyler being be&s;ieged, you will ha&s;ten to its relief, and I hope that the continental troops now in the county of Tryon, if joined by &s;ome of the militia, will be adequate to the bu&s;ine&s;s. Lieutenant Colonel Van Dyck is very well acquainted, not only with the country, but with many of the Indians, and will be capable of doing you good &s;ervice. Permit me therefore to recommend him to your attention.</P>
<P>Henry Glen, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> is A&s;&s;i&s;tant Deputy Quarter Ma&s;ter General at Schenectady, to whom you will apply for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in waggons and batteaus. If you could procure &s;uch a number of waggons as to convey the mens packs, it would greatly expedite your march. Orders are given to &s;end on a &s;upply of provi&s;ions. You will, however, not be retarded on that account, as the country is capable of affording a &s;ufficiency for your troops.</P>
<P>Colonel Van Dyck will inform you of the names of the Colonels of militia in Tryon county, and although I have already written to General Herkimer and the General Committee of the county to draw forth their militia, yet it will be proper for you, as &s;oon as you join the troops marched under the command of General Learned, to expedite expre&s;&s;es, entreating that the militia may be collected at the German Flats by the time you may arrive there.</P>
<P>A &s;mall regiment, commanded by Colonel Living&s;ton, is at John's-Town. The inhabitants of Caghna|waga have offered to hold that po&s;t, if Colonel Living&s;ton &s;hould be ordered up. You will be better enabled to judge of the propriety of moving him when you arrive there, and will do what you judge be&s;t.</P>
<P>Although the Mohawk Indians are far from being friendly to us, yet it would greatly prejudice our cau&s;e if they were in&s;ulted. You will therefore take every precaution to prevent it. The Oneidas have friendly &s;en|timents towards us, and mu&s;t be cheri&s;hed. They may perhaps be induced to take an active part in our &s;a|vour. Inclo&s;e you a warrant for one thou&s;and dollars in &s;pecie, which you will plea&s;e to make u&s;e of in order to conciliate the Oneidas, and to induce them to a&s;&s;i&s;t you. Be plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ure them that I wi&s;h to &s;ee them as &s;oon as they can come down, and that I have provided a genteel pre&s;ent for them.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Tryon county are cheifly Germans, e&s;pecially tho&s;e at the German Flats. I think it would &s;erve a good purpo&s;e to extol the action under General Herkimer, to prai&s;e their bravery, and give a&s;&s;urances that you wi&s;h to be joined by men, who have &s;o bravely defended them&s;elves. Compliment General Herkimer, and plea&s;e to make mine to him.</P>
<P>It is not only impo&s;&s;ible, but needle&s;s, to be more particular. I &s;hall therefore only add that if Fort Schuy|ler &s;hould unhappily have fallen into the enemy's hands, that you will then &s;o di&s;po&s;e of the troops as be&s;t to cover the country.</P>
<P>I have ordered on a quantity of ammunition from Albany. If it is not yet gone, pray take it with you. I very much que&s;tion whether more lead can be &s;pared, as none of that from Peek's Kill which was de&s;igned for this department is come up. If you &s;hould think the quantity of powder I have ordered to be in&s;ufficient, you can take more. It is be&s;t you &s;hould carry it on with you.</P>

The &s;entiments I have been happy enough to entertain of your humanity and &s;en&s;ibility have encrea&s;ed with my misfortunes, nor &s;hall ought ever be able to efface them.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd in&s;tant, two Briti&s;h officers, on their return to Canada, took &s;helter in a violent &s;torm of rain in my little hut, the only remains of all my buildings in this quarter. In the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, I found that the one was attached to General Carleton, the other to General Burgoyne. Carleton was faulted by the one for keeping more troops in Canada than what were nece&s;&s;ary. An alternation en&s;ued, and, from what pa&s;&s;ed, I had every rea&s;on to conclude that the number now in Canada, including the garri&s;on of Ticonderoga, does not exceed two thou&s;and. I &s;peak of tho&s;e in Canada proper, exclu&s;ive of the garri&s;on of O&s;wegatchie, Niagara, and the upper po&s;ts, which, from the conver&s;ation of the&s;e officers, I concluded to be between 1500 and 2000.</P>
<P>Whether it was po&s;&s;ible to have &s;ent a body of troops immediately after the Convention of this place to Ti|conderoga I will not venture n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w to &s;ay, but if they had been &s;ent I believe that we &s;hould have regained that po&s;t; for I learn from a tolerable intelligent countryman ju&s;t arrived from thence, that the hurry which prevails in embarking their &s;tores in &s;uch, that it &s;trongly indicates they are apprehen&s;ive of a vi&s;it, and will probably abandon it. If &s;o, it argues that they are too weak in Canada to &s;upport that garri&s;on in ca&s;e of an attack.</P>
<P>Impelled, Sir, by that affection for my country, which not all the injuries I have &s;u&s;tained have been able to &s;hake, I venture to &s;ugge&s;t to Congre&s;s, that I can conceive an irruption into Canada in the en&s;uing win|ter would be attended with a variety of happy con&s;equences, which will readily occur to Congre&s;s, provided that the force employed be &s;o re&s;pectable as to create &s;uch a confidence in the Canadians, as would induce them to join our arms for the pre&s;ervation of the country after we &s;hould have entered it. Perhaps five thou|&s;and men would be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="016142_0056_0F9B8DCF41F772D0">I am well aware that a winter's expedition is attended with more difficulties than will offer to a &s;uperficial ob&s;erver; but I am very far from thinking them in&s;urmountable, provided that mea&s;ures are pur&s;ued without delay, and the proper officers exert them&s;elves in the execution of the orders they receive. Congre&s;s may, perhaps, determine on &s;uch an expedition. I &s;hall therefore take the liberty to &s;ay, if they do, that the men who go on this &s;ervice &s;hould, be&s;ides their ordinary under-cloaths, be provided each with a good woollen cap, a &s;hort, but good, blanket coat, with a cape to turn over the cap, to prevent the &s;now falling on the neck, each two chequered woollen &s;hirts, a woollen pair of breeches, two pair of good woollen &s;tockings, a pair of Indian legings, &s;o long as to come up to the crotch, a pair of good Indian &s;hoes, and a pair of Engli&s;h &s;hoes, with a pair of good warm &s;ocks, and a pair of &s;tout mittens, and not to be &s;uffered to carry any other cloath|ing. Each man &s;hould al&s;o have a pair of creepers, a tinder-box or horn, &s;teel, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lints, and a bundle of matches to every ten men. One thou&s;and pair of &s;now &s;hoes &s;hould al&s;o be provided, 100 pair of &s;kates, 100 hand machines for firing ve&s;&s;els or buildings, 2000 mu&s;ket wooden cartridges, canes with &s;pikes, to be filled with a combu&s;tible compo&s;ition, to be &s;hot into ve&s;&s;els or buildings. Each man to be al&s;o furni&s;hed with a powder horn and bullet pouch. Two thou&s;and &s;pare &s;tand of arms &s;hould al&s;o be carried on, to furni&s;h &s;uch Canadians as might be willing to engage with us. All the&s;e articles &s;hould be collected at Albany, to be delivered to the troops immediately before they are to march. One thou&s;and men &s;hould al&s;o be &s;ent without delay to Skeen&s;borough, by the way of Fort Ann, from whence they &s;hould take down in rafts the boards that remain at the &s;aw-mill near that place, none of which have been de&s;troyed by the enemy, and 16000 are left there, a number &s;ufficient not only to cover the men comfortably, but al&s;o the provi&s;ions, of which a quantity, &s;uf+ficient for 5000 men for three months, &s;hould be carried to Skeen&s;borough in the cour&s;e of the winter, and bi&s;cuit &s;ent in&s;tead of flour. Before the march of the troops from thence, the Commi&s;&s;ary &s;hould pick of the be&s;t pork &s;ufficient for the army for fifteen days, and have it well boiled, then laid out to freeze, and packed up again, that the men may not be under the nece&s;&s;ity of cooking on their march.</P>
<P>As it will require 1500 carriages to move &s;uch a body of troops, and two of the three months provi&s;ions, with all the other &s;tores, a great quantity of hay &s;hould be purcha&s;ed, packed, and di&s;po&s;ed of in &s;uch place<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, as that it might be conveniently taken up by the &s;leds, whether they come from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts or thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> State. Corn, oats and pea&s;e &s;hould be collected in like manner, and directions given to each driver to bring with him three or four bags. But as I apprehend that a &s;ufficient number of hired &s;leds could not be conve|niently procured, I would advi&s;e that 500 common co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;e &s;leds, of which a carpenter will ea&s;ily compleat one in two days, &s;hould be made, and 1000 &s;tall fed oxen with yokes be purcha&s;ed, to draw the&s;e &s;leds, and the oxen killed as &s;oon as the army has penetrated Canada, that the &s;alt provi&s;ion may be &s;aved as much as po&s;&s;i|ble, that none may be taken from the Canadians, as I &s;uppo&s;e no &s;pecie can be procured to pay them. As it is in vain to attempt to carry on &s;uch an enterprize in a &s;ecret manner, application &s;hould be made to the Le|gi&s;lature of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and this State to aid in procuring the &s;leds, that every farmer who is to furni&s;h one may prepare him&s;elf in time, and the Committee of each di&s;trict &s;hould be obliged to deliver the &s;leds they are to furni&s;h at &s;uch rendezvous as the officer commanding the expedition &s;hould direct.</P>
<P>The whole &s;hould be in readine&s;s to move as &s;oon as the Lakes have taken, which will probably be by the middle of February; and if Ticonderoga &s;hould be abandoned, the army might move that way, if not, by the way of Ca&s;tle-Town and Otter-Creek, &s;o as to fall in with the Lake between Crown-Point and the Mouth of Otter-Creek, or, if the Lakes &s;hould not be &s;trong enough from thence, then not to approach the Lake until the army reaches Onion River.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be a&s;ked what military operations I have in idea to carry on, I would an&s;wer, whether Ti|conderoga is or will be abandoned or not, I would advi&s;e in the fir&s;t place to &s;ecure I&s;le-aux-Noix, and the army to halt there for three or four days, and all the &s;leds employed to bring timber on it for erecting a fortification; and before the army left it, five or &s;ix rows of &s;trong and heavy pickets &s;hould be drove in the &s;hip channel, which is there very narrow, and not deep, to prevent the enemy's &s;hipping from getting into the Lake. If St. John's &s;hould not be reduced before the &s;pring of the year, as I &s;u&s;pect it would not, at I&s;le-aux-Noix three hundred men, under the command of a judicious officer, &s;hould be left, with directions to fortify him&s;elf in the be&s;t manner he could. The re&s;t of the army &s;hould then proceed towards St. John's, which I &s;uppo&s;e the enemy would not abandon; and if it was found impracticable to form the &s;iege, becau&s;e of the fro&s;t and &s;now, one thou&s;and men &s;hould be left to blockade it. The remainder of the army &s;hould then proceed to reduce Chamble, which would be the work of a day or two, and then go on to Montreal, and &s;ecure what &s;tores might be left there by the enemy, and take all the merchandize that would be u&s;eful for the army, and &s;end it to Albany, paying the French merchants a generous price by bills on France, if Congre&s;s has a fund there to draw on, as I have been informed they have, nothing to &s;uch of the Engli&s;h as have been our enemies, when we were in Canada in 1775 and 1776. When at Montreal, the Com|manding Officer will be able to judge with certainty what force the enemy can gather in Canada to oppo&s;e him, and, if he finds that he can &s;pare a detachment, he &s;hould lend it to O&s;wegatchie, to &s;ecure or de&s;troy the enemy's &s;hipping, which are always laid up at that place. This bu&s;ine&s;s appears to me of the fir&s;t im|portance, as it would not only be a great &s;tep towards the reduction of Niagara, if Congre&s;s &s;hould attempt in the next campaign to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that very important pa&s;s, and which, if in our hands, would have a variety of &s;uch obvious good con&s;equences that I need not mention them; but it would al&s;o be nece&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;ecure a retreat that way, which, if a retreat is nece&s;&s;ary, I would rather wi&s;h than by the way of Champlain, if St. John's &s;hould hold out &s;o long as that the enemy might &s;end forces into Canada from New-York or el&s;ewhere. It may be a&s;ked, why I &s;hould with a retreat by Ontario, and how it could be effected? To the fir&s;t I an&s;wer, becau&s;e mea&s;ures may be taken to reinforce the army at their arrival at O&s;wego by troops from Albany, thence to proceed to the reduction of Niagara, if Congre&s;s thought proper; if not, they might return by the way of Fort Schuyler. To the &s;econd, that all the batteaus in the St. Lawrence, in the vicinity of Montreal, might be collected, and tho&s;e would probably be &s;ufficient to convey all the troops, if not, an additional number might &s;oon be con&s;tructed; and for that and other bu&s;ine&s;s one hundred carpenters &s;hould be &s;ent with the army into Canada. Nor &s;hould the Commanding Officer ne|glect, when at Montreal, to take ho&s;tages from the Cagnawaga and Cana&s;wago Indians, who will be in his power, for their peaceable behaviour, and tho&s;e &s;hould be &s;ent to the&s;e parts without delay. If St. John's
<PB N="58" REF="016142_0057_0F9B8E8B2F8F5E88">
&s;hould be reduced, I think it is pretty certain that a body of troops appearing before Ticonderoga the gar|ri&s;on would &s;urrender, &s;hould they not abandon it this fall, or on &s;eeing our preparations for going into Canada. It would therefore be nece&s;&s;ary to collect a body of troops, not only for that purpo&s;e, if nece&s;&s;ary, but, if Ticonderoga &s;hould be abandoned, to be &s;ent into Canada, to reinforce the army there in &s;uch a manner as that the country might be kept, and, if po&s;&s;ible, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ge of Quebec undertaken. For the con|veyance of the&s;e troops, batteaus &s;hould be built at Fort George, and begun upon as &s;oon as advice is received that the army is got into Canada. But if the army &s;hould be obliged to retreat, this expence may be thought needle&s;s. Not at all; for, if they retreat by Champlain, they may want boats; if by Ontario, the boats may be ea&s;ily conveyed into Hud&s;on's river, and from thence into the Mohawk river, to carry on provi&s;ions for the troops to go to Niagara, &s;hould an expedition be determined on; but whether it is or not, it would be imprudent not to prepare in &s;uch a manner as that troops might be &s;ent to Canada, if it &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will perceive that great exertions are nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch an enterprize, and that the officer who commands it, let him be who he will, will require a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And although I firmly re&s;olve to quit the army as &s;oon as the examination into my conduct &s;hall be made, and not again venture on the boi&s;terous ocean of public life, in which I have been &s;o mi&s;erably buffetted by &s;torms, yet, as a private gentleman, and without fee or reward, I will give every aid in my power to procure every nece&s;&s;ary, and make u&s;e of every exertion for the &s;ucce&s;s of the enterprize, if Congre&s;s &s;hould think fit to order the attempt to be made.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 12th of January la&s;t we did our&s;elves the honour to inform Congre&s;s of the re&s;ult of our delibera|tions re&s;pecting Indian affairs in this department. They will be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, from the inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from Mr. Deane, the Interpreter, that our opinion of the temper of the Senecas and Cayugas was but too well founded. Tho&s;e haughty nations cannot brook the di&s;grace which they &s;u&s;tained from the militia of Tryon county, under the late brave and worthy General Herkimer, near the German Flats, and from the Garri&s;on of Fort Schuyler, under the command of the gallant Colonel Gan&s;evoort. Their re&s;entment has undoubtedly been highly irritated by the infidious arts and bribes of our enemies, who, at a treaty held at Niagara, and which is ju&s;t concluded, have had an opportunity to give an edge to their animo&s;ity. The On|ondagoes we are apprehen&s;ive will al&s;o be drawn in to manife&s;t the &s;ame ho&s;tile &s;pirit. From the&s;e unfavourable circum&s;tances, there is too much rea&s;on to believe that an expedition will be formed again&s;t the we&s;tern frontiers of this State, Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania, in concert with the Briti&s;h troops, Ottowas, Chippewas, Wio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dots, Mingoes and other tribes. It is therefore, with the utmo&s;t anxiety, that we wait for the direction of Congre&s;s in an&s;wer to our la&s;t di&s;patches, without which we &s;hall be at an utter lo&s;s how to proceed. It is our opinion that vigorous preparations ought to be made, not only to defend the frontiers, but to cha&s;ti&s;e tho&s;e nations, by carrying the war, if po&s;&s;ible, into their country. Till they feel the power and the ju&s;t re&s;entment of the United States, there can be no &s;afety for the defencele&s;s inhabitants. The militia, who lo&s;t their leaders and many of their brave&s;t men at the German Flats, &s;uffered the additional misfortune of being deprived of their crops. If they &s;hould again be called upon in planting or harve&s;t time, their families mu&s;t be deprived of all &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Indeed, they are very &s;ore from what they have already &s;uffered, and want time to repair their pa&s;t calamities. Little therefore can be expected from their exertions, willing as they may be to give their aid. The Oneidas and Tu&s;caroras are &s;till very friendly; but, &s;o far from being capable of an active part, are under well grounded apprehen&s;ions of falling victims to the rage of their &s;avage neighbours. They call upon the United States, in who&s;e cau&s;e they took up the hatchet, and are in danger, to protect them, and it is become indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to erect &s;ome fortre&s;s, and &s;tation a &s;mall garri&s;on in their country, for the &s;ecurity of their women and children. We flatter our&s;elves that the Commanding Officer of this department will have in&s;tructions to receive our information, and to make immediate preparations for the defence of the frontiers and protection of our allies. The garri&s;on of Fort Schuyler, which con&s;i&s;ts only of one regiment, may be able to defend that fortre&s;s, but cannot repel the incur&s;ions and ravages of the enemy; and, if it &s;hould &s;o happen that Tryon county and the we&s;tern di&s;tricts of Albany &s;hould be de&s;erted, to &s;ay nothing of the di&s;tre&s;s of individuals, the difficulties of &s;upplying the army with flour would be in&s;ermount|able. The treaty will be held about the middle of the month. We cannot defer it long, and &s;hall be reliev|ed from the utmo&s;t anxiety by the in&s;tructions from the Honourable Congre&s;s, which we hope are on the way, or will be handed to us by the return of this expre&s;s without lo&s;s of time. We mu&s;t, if left to our&s;elves, do the be&s;t in our power, making u&s;e of the liberty given Mr. Duane to alter the &s;peech, &s;o that it may be adapted to circum&s;tances.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour to inclo&s;e the proceedings of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Indian affairs at the la&s;t treaty, held at John's-Town. The Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners intended to have addre&s;&s;ed the Honourable Congre&s;s in an official letter, which was prevented by the departure of Mr. Duane and Mr. Edwards, who were obliged by a &s;udden thaw to ha&s;ten from John's-Town before the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Indians was compleated, left the &s;well|ing of the rivers &s;hould have prevented them from reaching their families.</P>
<P>Mr. Duane, the gentlemen mentioned in the minutes, as well as the Commi&s;&s;ioners, were unanimou&s;ly of opinion that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to threaten the &s;avages with cha&s;ti&s;ement, as the only means left, &s;hort of actual cha&s;ti&s;ement, to induce them to ob&s;erve a &s;trict neutrality.</P>
<P>Whether it will have the wi&s;hed for effect, the re&s;ult of the Council to be held at Onondago, of which we expect to be informed in about forty days, mu&s;t determine. But, from the accounts received of their hitherto inimical di&s;po&s;ition and revengeful re&s;olutions, the gentlemen, I think, unanimou&s;ly believed that &s;uch of the Mohawks as have fled from their country, a majority of the Onondagoes, and the Cayugas and Senecas in ge|neral, will commence ho&s;tilities again&s;t us as &s;oon as they conveniently can, and that it would therefore be prudent early to take mea&s;ures to carry the war into their country, as it would not require a greater body of troops to de&s;troy their towns than what would be nece&s;&s;ary to protect the frontier inhabitants, who already labour under the greate&s;t apprehen&s;ions that they will &s;oon experience the ravages and cruelty of tho&s;e barba|rians. Since my return to this place, I have been honoured with a letter from the Legi&s;lature of this State, covering petitions from the inhabitants of Schohary, Cherry-Valley, Charlotte River, Delaware and Harper's Field, praying the Legi&s;lature for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. As it is not in the power of the Commi&s;&s;ioners to afford any aid to the&s;e expo&s;ed &s;ettlements, I have communicated the contents of the letter and petitions to the Marquis de la Fayette, that he may take mea&s;ures to enable the inhabitants to remain on their plantations.</P>
<P>Before I left John's-Town, an account which we had received that the enemy meant to take po&s;t at O&s;|wego was confirmed by the information of a tru&s;ty Indian, whom I had rea&s;on to believe had good autho|rity for what he a&s;&s;erted. Should this really be the ca&s;e, there will be little hope left that the Indians will remain neuter. I cannot avoid &s;ugge&s;ting, that I &s;u&s;pect the enemy intend to pro&s;ecute the plan which the French began in 1753, and to approach our frontiers with a line of &s;orts, from whence the Indians may be &s;upplied with every nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ent out to harra&s;s us, and to which they may retire after an excur&s;ion on our frontiers. As &s;uch a man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">euvre would not only prove extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to us, but al&s;o oblige us to keep a large body of troops on the interior frontiers, Congre&s;s will pardon me if I expre&s;s a wi&s;h that early and mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures may be taken to counteract it. Perhaps the mo&s;t, if not the only, effectual means to defeat &s;uch an intention of the enemy would be, by &s;ending a re&s;pectable army, not only to re|gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of O&s;wego, but to attempt the reduction of Niagara. The honourable Hou&s;e is too well aware of the various advantages that would re&s;ult to the States from having that pa&s;s in our hands, for me to pre&s;ume to point out even a &s;ingle one. I confe&s;s that &s;uch an expedition would be attended with many difficulties, that many requi&s;ites are to be procured, but if men and &s;alted provi&s;ions can be procured, I &s;hould imagine every thing el&s;e might be got in r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">adine&s;s by the la&s;t of May, provided that orders are given im|mediately. The enemy's &s;hipping on Ontario might indeed prove trouble&s;ome, but not &s;o as to prevent the troops from cro&s;&s;ing. It is certain they were not able to do it in 1758, when Colonel Brad&s;treet took Fort Fron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tenac. If Congre&s;s &s;hould enter on &s;uch a mea&s;ure, perhaps it might be well to cover the real de&s;ign by building the boats on Hud&s;on's River, and give out that they are intended for the more &s;peedy convey|ance of troops up and down that river.</P>
<P>Reflecting that Congre&s;s might perhaps have in contemplation the reduction of Niagara, or an expedition into Canada through Ontario, I have engaged Louis (commonly called Colonel Lewis, a friendly Caghna|waga, and a man of enterprize, who is going into Canada by the way of O&s;wegatchie, with three or four tru&s;ty Oneidas) to burn, if po&s;&s;ible, the enemy's ve&s;&s;els on Ontario; if not, to attempt the de&s;truction of tho&s;e at St. John's; and have promi&s;ed a thou&s;and dollars in &s;pecie as a reward, if the one or the other is ac|compli&s;hed. I hope for the approbation of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Louis, who expects to return in le&s;s than forty days, is al&s;o charged to bring me the mo&s;t exact account he can procure of the enemy's force in Canada, the po&s;ts occupied by them, and the numbers at each po&s;t; to inform him&s;elf, if po&s;&s;ible, what military operations the enemy mean to pro&s;ecute from Canada in the en&s;uing campaign, and to engage &s;ome of our Caghnawaga friends to give the earlie&s;t intelligence of the movements of the enemy, and of what provi&s;ions and military &s;tores may be &s;ent either to St. John's or up the St. Lawrence.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 7th in&s;tant I received a packet, which I believe was di&s;patched from your office, inclo&s;ing &s;everal York-Town papers of the 24th ult. which contained copies of Lord North's &s;uppo&s;ed motion of the 17th of February, of the two hills in con&s;equence thereof, and the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s thereon. I am peculiarly happy that the latter coincides &s;o perfectly with the ideas I had entertained, declared and propagated of the former. I have the further &s;atisfaction to advi&s;e Congre&s;s that the &s;entiments of all tho&s;e of my immediate country, with whom I have conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject, are &s;imilar to mine, and I have not a doubt but that the people in general will think alike on this important &s;ubject, notwith&s;tanding the indu&s;try of the enemy's agents in &s;preading the bills through the country, and their in&s;inuations that Great-Britain will yield to every thing except the Independency of the States, and that therefore the &s;en&s;e of the people ought to be taken on that &s;ubject. A &s;e&s;&s;ion of the Superior Court, which is at pre&s;ent held in this city, affords an opportunity of giving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> exten&s;ive alarm, to guard again&s;t the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arious de&s;igns of the enemy. I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> one of the papers to Chief Ju&s;tice Jay, who propo&s;ed to have it read in Court which I believe has been done. May I be permitted to mention to Congre&s;s, that I conceive exten&s;ive good con&s;equences would ari&s;e if &s;ome of the papers were tran&s;lated into French, and &s;ent into Canada, with &s;o much of the treaty entered into with the

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. KIRKLAND has tran&s;mitted me a &s;peech from Oneida, containing a me&s;&s;age from the Senecas. Inclo&s;e you an an&s;wer, which you will plea&s;e to communicate, making &s;uch additions and alterations as you &s;hall judge, from circum&s;tances that may ari&s;e, to be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>If the bu&s;ine&s;s at Onondago terminates according to our wi&s;hes, and that the Senecas are willing to enter into an alliance with us, I think no time &s;hould be lo&s;t to bring them into the field; and therefore wi&s;h you to take mea&s;ures accordingly, by having it hinted to them, that if a body of their warriors would join Gene|ral Wa&s;hington it would be an evidence of their &s;incerity, and an attonement for pa&s;t mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>I think, if the re&s;ult of the Council at Onondago is favourable, that a meeting with the whole Six Nations would not be improper, perhaps beneficial. I wi&s;h you to favour us with your opinion on this &s;ubject as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM ju&s;t honoured with your favour of the 8th in&s;tant, covering the hand-bill and paper referred to. Plea&s;e to accept of my be&s;t congratulatory compliments on events, which promi&s;e happine&s;s to America and confu&s;ion to her enemies, and my thanks for your polite attention.</P>
<P>I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to advi&s;e the Six Nations of Indians of the Alliance with France, and of the rejection of the treaty propo&s;ed by Britain. I hope I have not gone beyond the line of my duty, though I have done it without con&s;ulting my colleagues, as I apprehended that in waiting their arrival we &s;hould lo&s;e the opportunity of communicating the intelligence whil&s;t they were convened at Onondago. Copy of what I have &s;aid on the occa&s;ion I have the honour to inclo&s;e.</P>
<P>Your letter to the Commi&s;&s;ioners accompanied the other, together with that to Mr. Deane, which will be forwarded to him without delay.</P>

<P>On the 25th in&s;tant I received a letter from Mr. Deane, on the 27th one from Mr. Kirkland, and ye&s;terday a &s;econd from Mr. Deane, copies of which I have the honour to tran&s;mit you. The conduct of the &s;avages is my&s;terious and embarra&s;&s;ing. The twenty Senecas mentioned in Mr. Deane's la&s;t letter as coming down with a pri&s;oner are expected in a few days. I propo&s;e detaining them here until the pri&s;oner I wrote for &s;ome time ago arrives from the &s;outhward. Whil&s;t the&s;e people are with us, I do not apprehend that any ho&s;tilities will be committed by the others on the frontiers of this State, and perhaps Congre&s;s may think it expedient to order troops to be &s;ent up before they return. I think one thou&s;and men, with half the garri&s;on of Fort Schuyler, &s;uch militia as may be procured in Tryon county, and &s;ome of the Oneidas and Tu&s;caroras, would be quite &s;ufficient to burn the Cayuga Town and &s;ome of the Seneca Villages. Unle&s;s tho&s;e people are made to feel our power, they will, I fear, continue ho&s;tile as long as the enemy keep po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canada, and afford them &s;uch ample &s;upplies as they have hitherto done.</P>

<P>I HAVE many thanks to render you for your obliging favour of the 28th ult. which I have ju&s;t now had the plea&s;ure to receive.</P>
<P>After I had di&s;patched the letter in which I expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to have the papers I mentioned tran&s;lated and &s;ent into Canada, I communicated the matter to Chief Ju&s;tice Jay. He thought I might with propriety &s;end them into Canada, as they were publi&s;hed, without waiting the direction of Congre&s;s. I accordingly col|lected as many as I could, and &s;ent them to Caghnawaga, with directions how to di&s;tribute them in Montreal.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter of the 16th in&s;tant, covering re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s of the 11th, I had the honour to receive on the 25th at night. I was determined to have commenced my journey to York-Town on this day, but conceive it my duty to delay my departure until the bu&s;ine&s;s directed to the attention of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of Indian affairs is adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to pardon me, if I pre&s;ume to ob&s;erve that the object of the expedition, being con|fined to the cha&s;ti&s;ement of the Senecas only, does not &s;eem to be broad enough, as the Cayugas are equally in&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent and ho&s;tile, and that &s;ome of the Onondagoes are al&s;o proper objects of puni&s;hment. Both of the&s;e lie directly in the route to the Seneca country.</P>
<P>I have taken the liberty to inclo&s;e General Gates copy of a letter la&s;t night received from Mr. Deane (copy of which I have al&s;o the honour herewith to tran&s;mit to Congre&s;s) and ob&s;erved that, from the in|formation it contained, the pro&s;ecuting of the expedition with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch &s;eems to have become now more indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o hinted that the real object of the enterprize ought to be carefully concealed. I do not adduce the rea&s;ons, as they will occur, or probably have already occurred.</P>
<P>I do not know if General Gates will con&s;ider him&s;elf at liberty to order Colonel Gan&s;evoort's regiment as part of the troops for this &s;ervice. As it is numerous, and I believe well appointed, may I be permitted to wi&s;h that they were employed on this occa&s;ion, and that orders be given for the purpo&s;e. There can be no danger of Fort Schuyler, whil&s;t the troops for the expedition are in that part of the country, and I humbly apprehend it might be &s;afely tru&s;ted to a corps of militia, e&s;pecially if two or three of Colonel Gan&s;evoort's officers were left, with about twenty-five of his privates.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="016142_0060_0F9B8E8E8B2CCB48">As the batteaus which were ordered to be built in this quarter are not all fini&s;hed, I have taken the liberty to advi&s;e the Quarter Ma&s;ter to con&s;truct the remainder in &s;uch manner as to adapt them to the navigation of the Mohawk river, where they will be wanted to convey the provi&s;ions, &amp;c. to Fort Schuyler, which appears to me without compari&s;on to be the be&s;t, if not the only proper place to rendezvous the troops, both on account of its vicinity to the road leading to the Seneca country, and as it offers a fine opportunity effectually to con|ceal the object of the expedition until the troops are in march.</P>
<P>If the Senecas, who went from hence to Head-Quarters, are not yet adverti&s;ed of the death of the Chief they are in &s;earch of, I wi&s;h them to be detained as long as po&s;&s;ible. Perhaps a pretence of &s;ending an ex|pre&s;s to Fort Pitt to enquire for the Indian may an&s;wer the end.</P>

<P>Major General Schuyler reque&s;ts that Major General St. Clair may be &s;worn.</P>
<P>Major General St. Clair being &s;worn,</P>
<P>Q. by General Schuyler. During the time I had the honour of having you under my command, did you ever ob&s;erve any neglect of duty in my conduct?</P>
<P>A. None. As far as it fell within my ob&s;ervation, I have &s;een the direct contrary.</P>
<P>General Schuyler's que&s;tion. If I had been in Ticonderoga during the &s;iege, what would have been the probable con&s;equences?</P>
<P>A. The immediate con&s;equences, it appears to me, mu&s;t have been, that the re&s;t of the department mu&s;t have been neglected; becau&s;e your post ought to have been at or near Albany, to have collected the nece&s;&s;a|ries, and to have urged on the militia for the aid of the whole. Ticonderoga was at a corner of the depart|ment, in an uninhabited part of the country, and the communication to it from any part of the country (ex|cept New-England) acro&s;s a Lake.</P>
<P>General Schuyler's que&s;tion. Upon any alarm, did I turn out my&s;elf and the troops with any degree of alacrity?</P>
<P>A. Whenever there was an alarm, and I was pre&s;ent, I have always &s;een you do it with great alacrity, and you were always pre&s;ent your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What did you under&s;tand the intention of the order of Congre&s;s was, in appointing you to the command of Ticonderoga?</P>
<P>A. I under&s;tood it was that I &s;hould take the command of that po&s;t, &s;ubject to the orders of General Schuyler, or the Commanding Officer in the Northern Department; but I did not expect that he, or the Com|manding Officer, was per&s;onally to have taken the command of that po&s;t from me.</P>
<P>General Schuyler's que&s;tion to Major Lan&s;ing. Were you at Fort Edward with me immediately after the evacuation of Ticonderoga?</P>
<P>A. I was.</P>
<P>General Schuyler's que&s;tion. Did you at that time, or at any time before or &s;ince, ob&s;erve any negligence in my conduct with re&s;pect to public matters?</P>
<P>A. I did not; but at that time, and at every other time before and &s;ince, I ob&s;erved in you the greate&s;t attention to public matters, as far as came within my ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>General Schuyler's que&s;tion. Did I not, immediately after I returned from Ticonderoga, on being inform|ed of the approach of the enemy, make application to the State of New-York, and to the other States, to endeavour to get out the militia?</P>
<P>A. You did to the State of New-York and to the Ea&s;tern States, except Rhode-I&s;land, immediately on your return to Saratoga, on being informed of the enemy's approach.</P>
<P>After the examination of the above witne&s;&s;es, the General clo&s;es his Defence as follows:</P>
<P>It is incumbent on me to remark that the ob&s;ervation made by the Judge Advocate, that I went to Ti|conderoga in con&s;equence of General St. Clair's letters of the 13th or 18th June, is founded in error, which will appear by a retro&s;pect of my letter to Congre&s;s of the 14th from Saratoga, in which I expre&s;ly in|formed them that I arrived at that place on the evening of the 13th, on my way to Ticonderoga, and that at twelve I received an expre&s;s from General St. Clair, with his letters of the 13th.</P>
<P>Permit me, Mr. Pre&s;ident, and Gentlemen of the Court Martial, briefly to ob&s;erve, that from the beginning of November, 1776, to the latter end of March following, which was a month after I was &s;uperceded, my exertions to prepare for the campaign of 1777 were without intermi&s;&s;ion. That immediately on my re|appointment I returned to Albany, and adopted every po&s;&s;ible mea&s;ure to provide the nece&s;&s;aries for the cam|paign, to procure intelligence of the enemy's intentions, and to conciliate the affections, or guard again&s;t the ho&s;tile intentions, of the Indians; that within eight days after my arrival at Albany I went to vi&s;it Ticonderoga and the northern communication, that I might be per&s;onally informed of what was nece&s;&s;ary to be provided or done; that I was on the point of doing the like to Fort Schuyler and the we&s;tern commu|nication, when General St. Clair's letter arrived, advi&s;ing me of the approach of the enemy; that I lo&s;t not a moment's time in applying for reinforcements both of continental troops and militia; that I was on the way to put my&s;elf at the head of the &s;mall body of militia which had moved, when I received the account of the evacuation of Ticonderoga; that after that my exertions to prevent or retard the enemy's progre&s;s were without intermi&s;&s;ion, and not without &s;ucce&s;s, until I was, unhappily for me, no longer permitted to di|rect the military operations in the Northern Department; that from that time until this day I have never cea&s;ed affording every aid in my power to give &s;ucce&s;s to the glorious cau&s;e America is engaged in.</P>
<P>Here, Gentlemen, I &s;hall re&s;t my defence. It has indeed been prolix, but important. Facts and plain narrative, not declamation, have made it &s;o. My whole conduct has been, with the utmo&s;t candour, &s;ubmit|ted to your examination, and I hope the re&s;ult of this enquiry will re&s;tore me to that full confidence, which, at lea&s;t, the rectitude of my intentions gives me rea&s;on to expect. I forbear dwelling on the cau&s;es to which its diminution is to be a&s;cribed, le&s;t I &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of a de&s;ign rather to reproach than explain. What|ever may be time event, permit me to a&s;&s;ure you that my affection for my country will continue unimpaired,
<PB N="62" REF="016142_0061_0F9B8E8EE92D0400">
and that among the late&s;t actions of my life will be found the mo&s;t &s;incere endeavours to promote her pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject, without acknowledging my obligations for the candour and patience with which I have been heard, or without expre&s;&s;ing the high &s;en&s;e I entertain of the attention of his Excellency the Commander in Chief, in in&s;tituting &s;o re&s;pectable a Court on my trial.</P>
<P>THE Court, having con&s;idered the charge again&s;t Major General Schuyler, the evidence, and his de|fence, are unanimou&s;ly of opinion that he is NOT GUILTY of any Neglect of Duty in not being at Ticonderoga, as charged, and the Court therefore do acquit him with the highe&s;t honour.</P>
