<P>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, e&s;pecially unto them which are of the Hou&s;hold of Faith.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO <HI>do good, as we have opportunity,</HI> and according to our re&s;pective abilities, is a duty clearly pointed out by NATURE, and repeatedly com|manded in the more expre&s;s language of REVELATION.</P>
<P>EVERY man's own particular frame&mdash; his innumerable wants of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from others&mdash;his &s;ituation as a member of &s;o|ciety&mdash;and the tendency of this practice to improve and dignify the Agent; are <HI>natu|ral</HI> proofs of our obligation to perform kind and beneficent actions, or, in the words of my text, to <HI>do good unto all men.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH are the nature and frame of man, that what is mo&s;t worthy of the name of Happine&s;s is found, by experience, to be utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with an <HI>unfeeling</HI> &s;el|fi&s;hne&s;s. He that confines his aims and pro&s;pects to his own private intere&s;t, is <HI>a &s;tranger</HI> to, and <HI>doth not intermeddle with,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="012008_0005_0F893FDD34C579C8">
the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial and cordial &s;atis|faction, which this life affords. There is a generous, noble and exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure, experienced by the friendly and benevo|lent, which is incomparably &s;uperior to what a per&s;on of his character has ever felt, or can feel. As therefore the Author of our nature has annexed a much greater degree of happine&s;s to the exerci&s;e of the benevolent, than of the &s;elfi&s;h, Affections; it is evidently his will and intention, which are the foundation of all <HI>moral</HI> obligation, that every human creature &s;hould, as op|portunity offers, perform acts of kindne&s;s and beneficence.</P>
<P>THE innumerable wants of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from others, which we con&s;tantly experi|ence, are al&s;o a manife&s;t indication of the &s;ame intention. No man, for any con&s;iderable time, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world, can even &s;upport life, by his own endeavors. Not a &s;ingle day pa&s;&s;es, from his fir&s;t entrance upon this &s;tage of exi&s;tence until he makes his final <HI>exit,</HI> in which a man would not be mi&s;erable, were it not for the labor and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of other people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this point well illu&s;trated by Mr. WOLLASTON, in his <HI>Religion of Nature delincated.</HI> Sect. vii.</NOTE>. If he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of riches, for which he is always chiefly
<PB N="3" REF="012008_0006_0F893FDDEEAD5B28">
beholden to others; he mu&s;t know that bare riches&mdash;that &s;ilver and <HI>gold,</HI> how much &s;oever &s;ome men may place their <HI>hope</HI> and <HI>confidence</HI> in them, will nei|ther feed nor cloath him. They are in reality no otherwi&s;e u&s;eful to him, than as they may be exchanged, for what will immediately an&s;wer his nece&s;&s;ities and wants. If he has <HI>bread enough and to &s;pare</HI>; yet he finds that, in the literal &s;en&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>man doth not live by bread alone</HI>; but that other things are as nece&s;&s;ary as his daily food. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation might be extended to all the different circum&s;tances of life. No &s;ituation can be a&s;&s;igned, in which a man does not frequently want a&s;&s;i&s;tance, nor any in which he is not, in his turn, capable of giving a&s;&s;i&s;tance to others that want it, in &s;ome form or other. But if he refu&s;es to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he has no right to demand it; the claim being mutual and conditional. This farther &s;hews it to be the de&s;ign of Di|vine Providence, in placing him in &s;uch a &s;tate, that he &s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to others; or, that he &s;hould <HI>do good</HI> to them, as he has opportunity, and as ca&s;es may require.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="012008_0007_0F893FDEAFBDB5D0">THIS obligation will appear in a light that is &s;till more &s;triking, if we con&s;i|der our&s;elves as members of &s;ociety. All the individuals belonging to the human &s;pecies, however di&s;per&s;ed or di&s;tant from one another, or however differing in &s;entiments, manners, or poli|tical intere&s;ts, yet con&s;titute one &s;ociety or &s;y&s;tem, which is united together by many inviolable bonds. This general &s;ociety is divided into various di&s;tinct bodies or le&s;&s;er &s;ocieties; the members of which are linked together by &s;till clo&s;er ties, than tho&s;e which connect the di&s;tant members of a larger &s;y&s;tem. Thus the &s;ubjects of every kingdom, or the inhabi|tants of any country that are united under the &s;ame government, form a di&s;tinct civil &s;ociety; and they have a more intimate connection with one ano|ther, than what ari&s;es from their relation as men, or as belonging to the &s;ame &s;pecies. So again: the profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame religion, the di&s;ciples of the &s;ame ma&s;ter, con&s;titute a &s;ociety of a different kind; compared by St. Paul <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 12.</NOTE>, in one in&s;tance at lea&s;t, to the human <HI>body</HI>; all the parts or <HI>members</HI> of which have their re&s;pective u&s;es and functions a&s;&s;igned
<PB N="5" REF="012008_0008_0F893FDF71069D08">
them, and are mutually &s;ub&s;ervient to one another. And it de&s;erves our no|tice, that in proportion as &s;ociety is re|duced into a &s;maller compa&s;s by &s;ub|divi&s;ion, the members of it become of more con&s;equence, and their mutual good offices are more nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider our&s;elves then as mem|bers of &s;ociety, whether in a larger or more confined view, whether in a civil or religious &s;en&s;e; it will appear to be our duty to <HI>act</HI> as members of &s;ociety. Now to act as members of &s;ociety, is to perform all tho&s;e offices towards the body in general, and our fellow-members in particular, which the &s;tation a&s;&s;igned us, and the relation we are in, require; that is, according to our power, to contribute, in the fir&s;t place, what is nece&s;&s;ary to the be|ing, and then to the well-being, both of the body, and of any of its members; or, in o|ther words, to do all the good that we can.</P>
<P>SUCH conduct appears al&s;o to be our duty, as it naturally improves us; for we are under the &s;ame obligations to improve and perfect our&s;elves, as we are to pre&s;erve our&s;elves. Every right act has a tendency to produce a right habit and di&s;po&s;ition of mind; and the excel|lency of any moral agent con&s;i&s;ts as
<PB N="6" REF="012008_0009_0F893FE030EAE360">
much, at lea&s;t, in a right habit and di&s;po&s;ition, as in intellectual capacity or power. The Supreme Being is infinite perfection; and the more any other be|ing re&s;embles him, the farther he is ad|vanced towards a &s;tate of perfection. And the more any creature performs acts of goodne&s;s and kindne&s;s, and has acquired the habit of performing them, the more he re&s;embles that adorable Being, who&s;e goodne&s;s is perpetually exerci&s;ed, and extends to all the parts of the creation; and who delights in con|&s;tantly beholding millions of his creatures, of different ranks and orders, from the highe&s;t Angel down to the lowe&s;t reptile, enjoying the various degrees of perfection and happine&s;s, which they have derived from his bounty.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame con&s;iderations that prove it to be our duty to <HI>do good</HI> at all, prove al&s;o that we &s;hould do it, <HI>to all men, as we have opportunity.</HI> Why we &s;hould be bound to do good, and not to do all the good in our power, will be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;hew. To &s;uppo&s;e that a man has ten degrees of ability to do good, and yet that he is under obligations to exerci&s;e no more than five of them, is to &s;uppo&s;e that the other five degrees of this ability
<PB N="7" REF="012008_0010_0F893FE0EE4C3028">
were given him for no purpo&s;e. But, in truth, the obligation is always in pro|portion to the power and opportunity; &s;ince it ari&s;es from the circum&s;tances and connections in which GOD has placed us.</P>
<P>AS we are connected with all men, and are fellow-members with them of one general &s;ociety, we &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to <HI>do good unto all men.</HI> But as the mo&s;t important relation we bear to others in many re&s;pects, is that of fellow-chri&s;ti|ans; our obligation to do good to tho&s;e, who are in this relation to us, is propor|tionably &s;tronger. We are, according to the ju&s;t di&s;tinction in my text, <HI>as we have opportunity,</HI> to <HI>do good unto all men</HI>; but more <HI>e&s;pecially,</HI> and with peculiar attention, <HI>unto them which are of the hou&s;hold of faith.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT the light of nature thus teaches to be our duty, the voice of revelation univer&s;ally confirms. Under the Mo&s;aic in&s;titution indeed, the precepts injoining kindne&s;s and good offices have common|ly a particular reference to tho&s;e, who were members of the Jewi&s;h tribes; who, for wi&s;e rea&s;ons, were &s;eparated from all the families of the earth, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed with peculiar privileges; and who&s;e affections, &s;till wandering after the
<PB N="8" REF="012008_0011_0F893FE1AE9677C8">
vanities and &s;uper&s;titions of the idolatrous nations around them, it was nece&s;&s;ary to call off and re&s;train, with great &s;trictne&s;s and &s;everity. Yet notwith&s;tanding, in|&s;tances are not wanting under that di&s;pen&s;ation, in which kindne&s;s and acts of beneficence were required towards STRANGERS; <HI>i. e,</HI> per&s;ons who were unconnected with them by any political or religious ties, being, in the language of St. Paul, <HI>aliens from the commonwealth of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>THUS general benevolence to mankind was recommended to them, and urged, from the example of GOD him&s;elf, as well as from the con&s;ideration of their own former experiences. HE <HI>doth exe|cute the judgment of the fatherle&s;s and widow, and loveth the</HI> STRANGER, <HI>in giving him food and raiment. Love ye</HI> THEREFORE <HI>the</HI> STRANGER; <HI>for</HI> YE <HI>were &s;trangers in the land of Egypt.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> x. 18, 19.</NOTE> Again: <HI>when thou cutte&s;t down thine har|ve&s;t in the field, and ha&s;t forgot a &s;hief in the field, thou &s;halt not go again to fetch it: it &s;hall be for the</HI> STRANGER, <HI>for the fatherle&s;s and for the widow: that the Lord thy God may ble&s;s thee in all the work of thine hands.&mdash;And thou &s;halt remember
<PB N="9" REF="012008_0012_0F893FE26E1E2700">

<P>SUCH precepts, as the foregoing, have a tendency to impre&s;s upon the mind the great natural duty of univer&s;al kindne&s;s and benevolence; and they were undoubt|edly intended for that purpo&s;e. There were ca&s;es, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, wherein the Jews were commanded to treat <HI>&s;ome &s;trangers</HI> in a very different manner; but the exceptions from the general rule were not many, and &s;pecial rea&s;ons were always a&s;&s;igned for them.</P>
<P>THUS an unrelenting &s;everity towards the <HI>Canaanites</HI> was directed and pre&s;cribed in the&s;e words. <HI>When the Lord thy God &s;hall bring thee into the land whither thou goe&s;t to po&s;&s;e&s;s it, and hath ca&s;t out many nations before thee:&mdash;and when the Lord thy God &s;hall deliver them before thee, thou &s;halt &s;mite them, and</HI> UTTERLY DESTROY <HI>them; thou &s;halt make no covenant with them,</HI> NOR SHEW MERCY <HI>unto them.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> vii. 1, 2.</NOTE> The I&s;raelites were al&s;o commanded to

<P>IF from the Law, we turn to the Go&s;|pel;
<PB N="11" REF="012008_0014_0F893FE4C6B0AD50">
we &s;hall find every page of it &s;hining with precepts, or examples, of the mo&s;t active and unbounded Charity.

The whole &s;y&s;tem of the Go&s;pel, and every part of it, have a &s;trong tendency to in&s;pire and e&s;tabli&s;h, the mo&s;t refined and exalted &s;entiments, and the mo&s;t vigorous and unlimited exerci&s;e, of love and affection to our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>IT is a fundamental law in this benevo|lent in&s;titution, relating to our mutual in|tercour&s;e, that we make our own rea&s;onable wi&s;hes and de&s;ires, in ca&s;e our circum|&s;tances were exchanged for tho&s;e of other men, the rule of our conduct towards them.

<P>I have recited the&s;e ver&s;es in connection, becau&s;e the whole pa&s;&s;age, taken together, not only contains the law of our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, but explains the rea&s;on of it, as well as the extent and perfection in which it ought to be interpreted.</P>
<P>AND indeed, a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, unlimited with regard to its objects, is repre&s;ented throughout the New Te&s;ta|ment to be of &s;uch con&s;equence, that our eternal happine&s;s depends upon our having it.

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING, as has been already ob&s;erved, and as my text inti|mates, this great and e&s;&s;ential qualificati|on is not a blind and <HI>undi&s;tingui&s;hing</HI> affection, leading us equally to love all men, without any regard to the difference of their characters. The love of GOD extends to all men; but &s;ome are the objects of his peculiar affection, as being in reality more worthy than others. Among the <HI>di&s;ciples</HI> of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, there was one <HI>whom he loved</HI> in an emi|nent degree; <HI>leaving us,</HI> even in this re&s;pect, <HI>an example, that we &s;hould follow his &s;teps.</HI> If <HI>the righteous is more excellent than his neighbor,</HI> he is more de&s;erving of our e&s;teem than his neighbor; for we &s;hould e&s;teem every thing, and love every one in &s;ome degree of proportion to the real excellence, which that thing or that per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="012008_0017_0F893FE6EEDD96D0">EVERY man is intitled to &s;ome degree of e&s;teem, on this account. The wor&s;t of men po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;omething that is valuable.

How then mu&s;t it affect every tender, humane and gene|rous heart in this Chri&s;tian a&s;&s;embly! Indigence is terrible in all ca&s;es; but when it &s;ucceeds fulne&s;s of bread&mdash;when it comes &s;uddenly&mdash;when it falls upon per&s;ons of delicate &s;en&s;ibility <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>The cau&s;es of plea&s;ure and pain are relative things: and in order to e&s;timate truly their effect upon any par|ticular &s;ubject, they ought to be drawn into the <HI>degrees of perception</HI> in that &s;ubject. When the cau&s;e is of the &s;ame kind, and acts with an equal force, if the perception of one per&s;on be equal to that of another, what they perceive mu&s;t needs be equal. And &s;o it will likewi&s;e be, when the forces in the producing cau&s;es and the degrees of perception in the &s;entiments are reciprocal. For (which doth not &s;eem to be con&s;idered by the world, and therefore ought the more particularly to be noted) if the cau&s;e of plea&s;ure or pain &s;hould act but half as much upon A, as it does upon B; yet if the <HI>&s;en&s;ibility</HI> of A be double to that of B, the &s;um of their plea&s;ures or pains will be equal.

their former way of life are peculiarly unable to help them&s;elves, it is more than doubly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>NOW, to remedy &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, or ra|ther to prevent it as far as po&s;&s;ible, which is &s;till a greater act of humanity; a <HI>corporation</HI> has been erected, con&s;i&s;ting of the clergy in general, and gentlemen of the fir&s;t rank and character in the&s;e three colonies; who&s;e countenance and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in this good work, are ac|knowledged with all gratitude. A fund is now e&s;tabli&s;hed by <HI>charter;</HI> to which the clergy them&s;elves are large annual &s;ub&s;cribers, and to which &s;everal gene|rous donations have been already made. That venerable &s;ociety, which is famed throughout the Chri&s;tian world for its charity&mdash;a charity, to which our church in the&s;e colonies, in a great mea&s;ure, owes its exi&s;tence&mdash;contributes a yearly
<PB N="33" REF="012008_0036_0F893FF5F0C23D20">
allowance of &pound; 60 &s;terling. Collections have been made in &s;everal congregations, the largene&s;s of which is not le&s;s honor|able to them, than to this in&s;titution. But notwith&s;tanding all that has been done, much remains &s;till to be done, in order to make our fund adequate to the purpo&s;e for which it is intended: and we mu&s;t depend upon the farther kindne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion of our friends, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in making up the deficiency.</P>
<P>AND in order to obtain it, can it be nece&s;&s;ary to do more, than to give a plain and true repre&s;entation of the de&s;ign? Can it be needful to make u&s;e of arguments or entreaties, to prevail with our friends, who are of the &s;ame <HI>hou&s;hold</HI> with our&s;elves, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in a work, in which, at the &s;ame time, their own reputation is peculiarly concerned, as well as the honor of their religion?</P>
<P>IT has been &s;hewn, in this di&s;cour&s;e, that the clergy have an undoubted right to a comfortable maintenance for them|&s;elves and their families; which right ought to take place, where the &s;tate of a country will admit of it: yet, for want either of inclination or ability in their friends, that their maintenance is deficient in the&s;e colonies. But, at pre|&s;ent,
<PB N="34" REF="012008_0037_0F893F827292B378">
we relinqui&s;h the claim. We are not now contending for <HI>rights;</HI> nor do we demand any thing for our&s;elves: we only reque&s;t your CHARITY, in mak|ing &s;ome decent provi&s;ion for the relief of our wives and children, when they &s;hall come more &s;en&s;ibly to feel the bitter effects of that ill fortune which has hi|therto attended us. We make this application and reque&s;t, in full confi|dence of your humanity and compa&s;&s;ion.

<P>WE de&s;ire you to do no more, on this occa&s;ion, than what your abilities will fairly admit of&mdash;to give no more, than what you can conveniently &s;pare, or what may ea&s;ily be retrenched from the &s;uperfluities of living; of which every man is allowed to judge for him|&s;elf. And you may be a&s;&s;ured, that whatever &s;hall be given in this way will be faithfully applied, if not for the im|mediate &s;upport of the clergy them&s;elves, yet for the &s;upport of tho&s;e who are as

dear to them as them&s;elves, when they &s;hall need it mo&s;t. Whatever is given in this way will therefore lay <HI>us</HI> under equal obligations, with what is given to our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>AND, at the la&s;t day, when all our accounts, both of ju&s;tice and charity, &s;hall be publickly <HI>audited,</HI> each of us will make the acknowledgment, with re|gard to what you &s;hall contribute to this fund, for the relief of our widows and children: <HI>ina&s;much as ye have done it unto my little ones,</HI> whom I left behind me in a helple&s;s condition, and to her who was mo&s;t dear to me on earth, <HI>ye have done it unto me.</HI> The like acknow|ledgment will al&s;o be made by one, whom you are under infinitely greater obligations to regard; even <HI>the Son of Man,</HI> when <HI>he &s;hall appear,</HI> &s;urrounded with <HI>his Angels,</HI> and &s;eated on the throne of his glory <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> xxv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT our conduct on this, and all other occa&s;ions, may meet with appro|bation in that day, may GOD of his infinite mercy grant, through the merits and mediation of JESUS CHRIST, who&s;e charity and compa&s;&s;ion led him to die for us; to whom therefore, with the Father and Holy Gho&s;t, be glory and dominion, adoration and prai&s;e, now and forever!</P>

<P><PB N="60" REF="012008_0058_0F8940066F067B90">ALTHOUGH the foregoing laws and regulations were enacted upon as full and mature deliberation as the time would admit, yet, upon recon&s;idering them carefully the next day, when the number of members pre&s;ent was not &s;ufficient to authorize any alteration or amendment, &s;ome things, relative to the payments to be made by tho&s;e of the clergy who&s;e widows and children were to be intitled to annuities, &s;eeming to have been tacitly <HI>implied,</HI> which ought rather to have been fully <HI>expre&s;&s;ed,</HI> in order to prevent any future mi&s;apprehen|&s;ion of the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e articles; it was therefore thought expedient, that an <HI>explanatory article</HI> &s;hould be added, to be agreed to and &s;ub&s;cribed by all the clergy pre&s;ent, and, in future, by every clergyman who &s;hould become a con|tributor, in order to intitle his widow and children to an annuity from this fund; until &s;uch time as a majority of the members of the corporation &s;hould again be met, to give this explanatory article, &s;uch further &s;anction as might be thought nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>BY the foregoing laws and regulations a plan was &s;ettled for the management and di&s;po&s;ition of a fund, that was, partly, to ari&s;e from the <HI>&s;tated contributi|ons</HI> of tho&s;e who&s;e families were to be intitled to relief and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from it.

<PB N="62" REF="012008_0060_0F894007EE7B4AC0">
not be doubted that large additions would be made by the genero&s;ity and charity of the benevolent and tender-hearted; e&s;pecially as the wants and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e, who by this in&s;titution are to be relieved and a&s;&s;i&s;ted, could not fail to have been <HI>peculiarly</HI> intere&s;ting and affecting to per&s;ons of humanity and &s;en&s;ibility. Two years, only, and a few months, have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the corpo|ration was erected; and the members of it have the plea&s;ure to acknowledge, that they are already indebted to the worthy and humane, for as much a&s;&s;i&s;|tance as could have been expected in &s;o &s;hort a time; and they are encouraged to promi&s;e them&s;elves a continuance of the public favor to the excellent charity, which they have undertaken to manage and conduct.</P>
<P>IT was intended, that a full account of the benefactions, received during the former year, &s;hould have been annexed to the &s;ermon, preached before the cor|poration at New-York, and publi&s;hed, at their reque&s;t, by the Revd.

<P>BESIDES the benefactions above ac|knowledged, it remains to mention one, which (though not yet come to hand) is no le&s;s intitled to the public thanks of the corporation. At the annual meeting in <HI>New-York,</HI> October 2d, 1770, a com|mittee being named, to devi&s;e a proper &s;eal for the corporation, <HI>Jocob Le Roy</HI> E&s;q. offered to pay the expence of any &s;eal that &s;hould be agreed upon, the price not ex|ceeding ten guineas. This generous offer was politely accepted by the board; and
<PB N="66" REF="012008_0064_0F89400BAE6DF0C8">
a &s;eal was accordingly ordered, and is daily expected from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>AND here al&s;o it is, with plea&s;ure, ac|knowledged, that the &s;incere thanks of the corporation are due to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Thomas Wharton,</HI> rector of St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s at <HI>Bridgetown,</HI> in <HI>Barbados;</HI> who, on the fir&s;t intelligence he received of this chari|table in&s;titution, warmly intere&s;ted him|&s;elf in its behalf, &s;oliciting his brethren and acquaintance, in that I&s;land, to join with him in contributing
<Q>to &s;o lauda|ble, &s;o worthy an undertaking.</Q>
Such are the terms in which he expre&s;&s;es his approbation of the &s;cheme, and his zeal for its &s;ucce&s;s, in a letter to Dr. Smith, dated &s;o early as May, 1770; in which he intimates to the corporation his hope of procuring &s;ome con&s;iderable contribu|tions to their fund. The corporation have not yet received any direct account of the &s;ucce&s;s of his application; but the rea|dine&s;s and zeal with which it has been &s;econded and &s;upported by the <HI>clergy,</HI> and by many of the principal gentlemen of the <HI>laity.</HI> in Barbados, appear from the following adverti&s;ement, which was lately in&s;erted, for &s;everal weeks together, in the Barbados Mercury.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="012008_0065_0F89400C730245F8">The benevolent and humane are acquainted, that a &s;ub&s;cription has been opened for the re|lief of the widows and orphans of the clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church in North-America, and that the members of the a&s;&s;embly, and &s;everal other principal gentlemen of the I&s;land, have been plea&s;ed to encourage the laudable &s;cheme, by cheerfully contributing to the charitable de&s;ign. Notice therefore is hereby given, that the &s;everal clergymen of the I&s;land will receive &s;ub&s;criptions, from &s;uch of their pari&s;hioners as will be plea&s;ed to offer their bounty; and the &s;ums &s;ub&s;cribed will be duly tran&s;mitted, by Henry Duke E&s;q. and the Rev.
