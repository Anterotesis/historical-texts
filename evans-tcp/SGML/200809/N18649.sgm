<HEAD>THE LIFE OF VOLTAIRE.</HEAD>
<P>THE life of Voltaire &s;hould nece&s;&s;arily be the hi&s;tory of the progre&s;s of the arts as promoted by his genius, of the power which he exerci&s;ed over the opinions of his age, and of the long war which in his youth he declared again&s;t prejudice, and which he maintained to the day of his death.</P>
<P>When the influence of a philo&s;opher ex|tends it&s;elf to the multitude, when it is &s;udden and felt at each in&s;tant of his life, he is indebted for this influence to his charac|ter, to his mode of ob&s;ervation, and to his conduct, as much as to his works. Every cir|cum&s;tance relating to &s;uch a man promotes the &s;tudy of the human mind; with which we cannot hope to become acquainted, if we do not ob&s;erve its properties as they exi&s;t

in tho&s;e to whom Nature has been prodigal of her riches and her power, and if we do not &s;eek in &s;uch minds what they po&s;&s;e&s;s in common with others, and in what they are di&s;tingui&s;hed. Man is in general indebted for his opinions, and even for his pa&s;&s;ions, and his character, to tho&s;e by whom he is &s;urrounded; he derives them from the laws, the prejudices of his country, as the plant receives nutriment from the &s;oil and the elements. When we contemplate the vul|gar mind, we di&s;cover the power to which we are &s;ubject by nature, (or habit;) but not the &s;ecret of internal &s;trength, nor the laws of the human under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Fran&ccedil;ois Marie Arouet, who by a&s;&s;uming the name of Voltaire has rendered it &s;o fa|mous, was born at Chatenay, on the 20th of February, 1694, and was baptized at Paris, in the church of St. Andre-des-Ares, on the 22d of November in the &s;ame year. His exce&s;&s;ive weakne&s;s was the cau&s;e of this delay, which, during life, occa&s;ioned doubts concerning the place and time of his birth. Fontenelle, in like manner, was obliged to be privately baptized, becau&s;e his life was de&s;paired of, from the feeblene&s;s of his in|fancy. It is &s;omewhat &s;ingular that the&s;e two men, both &s;o famous in this age, who&s;e lives and under&s;tandings were each of &s;uch

long duration, &s;hould mutually be born languid and feeble.</P>
<P>The father of M. de Voltaire exerci&s;ed the office of trea&s;urer to the chamber of accounts; his mother, Marguerite d'Au|mart, was of a noble family of Poitou. Their &s;on has been reproached for having taken the name of Voltaire: that is, for having followed a cu&s;tom at that time gene|rally practi&s;ed by the rich citizens and young|er &s;ons, who, leaving the family name to the heir, a&s;&s;umed that of a fieif, or perhaps of a country hou&s;e. His birth was que&s;tioned in numerous libels. His enemies, among men of literature, &s;eemed to fear that the fa&s;hionable world would too readily &s;acri|fice its prejudices to the plea&s;ure found in his &s;ociety, and the admiration his talents in&s;pired, and that a man of letters &s;hould be treated with too much equality. Such reproaches did him honour; malignity does not attack the birth of a man of literature, but from a &s;ecret con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, which it cannot &s;tifle, that it is wholly unable to dimini&s;h his per&s;onal fame.</P>
<P>The fortune which M. Arouet the father enjoyed was doubly advantageous to his &s;on; it procured him the advantages of educa|tion, without which genius never attains tho&s;e heights to which it might otherwi&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="024210_0005_0FC55B1D8490F5E8">
arive. If we examine modern hi&s;tory, we &s;hall find that all men of the fir&s;t order, all tho&s;e who&s;e works have approached per|fection, had not to repair the defects of education.</P>
<P>Nor was the advantage of being born to an independent fortune le&s;s ine&s;timable. M. de Voltaire never felt the mi&s;ery of being obliged to abandon his liberty that he might procure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; to &s;ubject his genius to labour, which the nece&s;&s;ity of living en|forced; nor to flatter the prejudices, or the pa&s;&s;ions, of a patron. His mind was not en&s;laved by &s;uch habitual fears, which not only impede invention, but impre&s;s the character of incertitude and feeblene&s;s on every effort of the imagination. His youth, undi&s;turbed by the doubts and fears of pov|erty, did not expo&s;e him to the danger of contracting that &s;ervile timidity which in|&s;pires the weak mind with habitual depen|dence; or that acrid, re&s;tle&s;s, and &s;u&s;picious irritability which is an infallible con&s;equence to the man of genius, when contending be|tween that dependence to which he is by nece&s;&s;ity &s;ubjected, and that freedom which the &s;ublime thoughts by which he is occu|pied demand.</P>
<P>The young Arouet was &s;ent to the Je&s;u|i&s;ts' college, where the &s;ons of the fir&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="024210_0006_0FC55B1F0D5A84A0">
nobility, except tho&s;e of the Jan&s;eni&s;ts, re|ceive their education. The Jan&s;eni&s;ts, who were hated at court, were &s;eldom &s;een among men who, being at that time oblig|ed by cu&s;tom to choo&s;e a religion which they did not under&s;tand, naturally adopted that which be&s;t could promote their temporal intere&s;t. The profe&s;&s;ors of rhetoric, under whom he was placed, were Father Por&eacute;e and Father Jay: the fir&s;t, being a man of under&s;tanding, and of a good heart, di&s;|covered the &s;eeds of a future greatne&s;s in his &s;cholar; and the latter, &s;truck with the boldne&s;s of his opinions and the indepen|dence of his mind, predicted that he would become the apo&s;tle of dei&s;m in France; both of which prophecies were verified by time.</P>
<P>When he left college, he again found the Abb&eacute; de Ch&acirc;teauneuf, his god-father and the friend of his mother, an intimate at home. The Abb&eacute; was one of tho&s;e men who, having entered into the eccle&s;ia&s;tic e&s;tate from complai&s;ance, or from momenta|ry ambition not native to their mind, after|wards &s;acrifice fortune and &s;acerdotal digni|ties to the love of living at large, being unable continually to wear the mu&s;k of hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>The Abb&eacute; de Ch&acirc;teauneuf was intimate
<PB N="8" REF="024210_0007_0FC55B269786B098" MS="y">
with Ninon de l'Enclos, whom, for her pro|bity, her under&s;tanding, and her freedom of thought, he long had pardoned in de&s;|pight of the &s;omewhat notorious adventures her youth. The fa&s;hionable world were plea&s;ed that &s;he had refu&s;ed the invitation of her former friend, Madame de Mainte|non, who had offered to invite her to court, on condition that &s;he would become a de|votee. The Abb&eacute; de Ch&acirc;teauneuf had pre|&s;ented Voltaire to Ninon. Though but a boy, he already was a poet; already began to teize his Jan&s;eni&s;t brother by his trifling epigrams, and to plea&s;e him&s;elf with reci|ting the Mo&iuml;&s;ade of Rou&s;&s;eau.</P>
<P>Ninon had taken delight in the pupil of her friend, and had left him by will 2000 livres (about 80 guineas) to purcha&s;e books. Thus was he taught, by fortunate circum|&s;tances, even in infancy and before his un|der&s;tanding was formed, to regard &s;tudy and labours of the mind as plea&s;ing and ho|nourable employments; thus did he learn, by the &s;ociety of people &s;uperior to vulgar opinions, that the mind of man is born free, and that he has a right to judge whatever he can comprehend; while, by a cowardly conde&s;cen&s;ion to prejudice, the common cour&s;e of education pre&s;ents nothing to childhood but the di&s;graceful marks of &s;er|vitude.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="024210_0008_0FC55B2D63ECDA88">Hypocri&s;y and intolerance were predomi|nant at the court of Louis the XIVth. which was much more &s;eriou&s;ly occupied in affect|ing the ruin of Jan&s;eni&s;m than in relieving the &s;ufferings of the people. The report of his incredulity had occa&s;ioned Catinat to lo&s;e the confidence which was due to his vir|tues and his abilities for war. De Ven|d&ocirc;me was reproached with occa&s;ionally ne|glecting ma&s;s; and the &s;ucce&s;s of the here|tic Marlborough, and the infidel Eugene, was attributed to his want of devotion. This hypocri&s;y had di&s;gu&s;ted tho&s;e whom it could not corrupt; and, in aver&s;ion to the au&s;terities of Ver&s;ailles, the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable &s;ocieties of Paris affected to carry their li|berty and the love of plea&s;ure even to licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Abb&eacute; de Ch&acirc;teauneuf introduced the young Voltaire to the&s;e &s;ocieties, and par|ticularly to the company of the Duke de Sul|ly, the Marquis de la Fare, the Abb&eacute; Servien, the Abb&eacute; de Chaulieu, and the Abb&eacute; Court|in; who were often joined by the Prince de Conti, and the grand Prior de Vend&ocirc;me.</P>
<P>M. Arouet imagined his &s;on was ruined, when he was told that he wrote poetry and frequented the &s;ociety of people of fa&s;hion. He wi&s;hed to make him a judge, and &s;aw him employed on a tragedy. This family

quarrel ended by &s;ending the young Voltaire to the Marquis de Ch&acirc;uteauneuf, the French amba&s;&s;ador in Holland.</P>
<P>His exile was not of long duration. Ma|dame du Noyer, who had fled thither with her two daughters rather to avoid her hu&s;|band than from zeal for the prote&s;tant reli|gion, was then at the Hague, where &s;he li|ved by intrigues and libels, and proved from her conduct that &s;he did not go thither in &s;earch of liberty of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>M. de Voltaire became enamoured of one of her daughters; and the mother, find|ing that the only advantage &s;he could gain from his attachment was that of making it public, carried her complaints to the amba&s;|&s;ador, who forbade his young dependent to continue his vi&s;its to Mademoi&s;elle du Noyer; and &s;ent him back to his family for having di&s;obeyed his orders.</P>
<P>Madame du Noyer failed not to print this &s;tory with the Letters of the young Arouet to her daughter, hoping that this already well known name would promote the &s;ale of her book; and vaunted of her maternal &s;everity and delicacy in the very libel in which &s;he proclaimed her daughter's di&s;honour.</P>
<P>The fine feelings of the author of Za&iuml;re and Tancrede are not di&s;coverable in the&s;e

letters. The &s;en&s;ations of impa&s;&s;ioned youth are &s;trong, but their gradations it is unable to di&s;tingui&s;h; it neither can &s;elect tho&s;e &s;trong and rapid traits which characterize pa&s;&s;ion, nor find terms which paint its feel|ings to the imagination, and infu&s;e them in|to the &s;oul of the reader; while devoured by love, the mo&s;t &s;incere and the mo&s;t ar|dent, it is apparently dull, cold, or extra|vagant. The talent of painting the pa&s;&s;ions for the theatre appears to be one of the la&s;t which di&s;covers it&s;elf in poets. Racine had given no tokens of it either in Les Fr&egrave;re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ennemis, or in Alexandre; and Brutus pre|ceded Za&iuml;re. Not only, mu&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions have been felt before they can be de&s;cribed, but their emotions and effects mu&s;t have been remarked when they have cea&s;ed to lord it over the mind, and when they exi&s;t only in the recollection. The heart is &s;ufficient to make us &s;en&s;ible of their exi&s;tence; but, to expre&s;s them with energy and truth, the &s;oul mu&s;t hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> long been under their influ|ence, and experience mu&s;t have been im|proved by reflexion.</P>
<P>The youth, when returned to Paris, &s;oon forgot his love; but he did not forget to u&s;e every effortt hat he might wre&s;t a young and e&s;timable woman, who was natively virtu|ous, from a corrupt and intriguing mother.

He employed the zeal of Pro&s;elyti&s;m<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Il employa le z&egrave;le du Pro&s;&eacute;liti&s;me; the mean|ing. I imagine, is, that he made her a convert from the prote&s;tant to the catholic faith.</NOTE>. He was aided by &s;everal bi&s;hops, and even je&s;u|its. The project failed, but Voltaire had afterward the good fortune to be of &s;ervice to Mademoi&s;elle du Noyer, when &s;he had married the Baron de Vinterfeld.</P>
<P>His father, however, finding him per&s;i&s;t in writing poetry, and living at large, for|bade him his hou&s;e. The mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letters made no impre&s;&s;ion on him; the &s;on even a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to go to America, pro|vided that before his departure he might but be permitted to kneel at his feet; but there was no choice, he mu&s;t determine not to depart for America, but to bind him&s;elf to an attorney. He did not here remain long; M. de Caumartin, the friend of M. Arouet, pitied the fate of his &s;on, and reque&s;ted per|mi&s;&s;ion to take him to St. Ange; where, removed from tho&s;e &s;ocieties which alarmed paternal affection, he might reflect on, and make choice of a profe&s;&s;ion. Here he met with Caumartin, the elder, a re&s;pectable old man, who was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of Hen|ry the IVth, and Sully, at that time too much forgotten by the nation. Caumartin

had been intimate with the be&s;t informed men of the reign of Louis the XIVth, and was acquainted with the mo&s;t &s;ecret anec|dotes, &s;uch as they really happened. The&s;e he took a plea&s;ure to recount, and Voltaire returned from St. Ange, occupied by the project of writing an epic poem, of which Henry the IVth, &s;hould be the hero, and ardently de&s;irous of &s;tudying the Hi&s;tory of France. To this journey are we indebted for the Henriade, and the age of Louis XIV.</P>
<P>The death of this monarch was recent; the people, of whom he long had been the idol, the very people who had pardoned his profu&s;ion, his wars, and his de&s;poti&s;m, and had applauded his per&s;ecution of the pro|te&s;tants, in&s;ulted his memory by te&s;tifying in|decent joy. A bull, obtained from Rome again&s;t a book of devotion, had occa&s;ioned the Pari&s;ians to forget that glory of which they &s;o long had been enamoured. Satires on the memory of Louis the Great were as numerous as eulogies had been during his life. Voltaire being accu&s;ed of having written one of the&s;e &s;atires, was &s;ent to the ba&s;tile. The poem ended with the following line:
<Q>J'ai vu c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s maux, et je n'ai pas vingt ans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e evils have I &s;een, yet have not reached my twentieth year.</NOTE>.</Q>
Voltaire was then upwards of two and twen+ty,
<PB N="14" REF="024210_0013_0FC55B4234958858">
and the police took his conformity of age to be proof &s;ufficient to deprive him of his liberty.</P>
<P>It was in the ba&s;tile that the young poet &s;ketched his poem of the League, corrected his tragedy of Oedipus, which he had begun long before, and wrote &s;ome merry ver&s;es on the misfortune of being there a pri&s;oner. The regent Duke of Orleans, being inform|ed of his innocence, re&s;tored him to free|dom, and granted him a recompen&s;e.</P>
<P>"I thank your royal highne&s;s," &s;aid Vol|taire, "for having provided me with food; but I hope you will not, hereafter, trouble your&s;elf concerning my lodging."</P>
<P>The tragedy of Oedipus was performed in 1718. The author had hitherto been known only by his fugitive pieces, by &s;ome epi&s;tles which breathed the &s;pirit of Chau|lieu, but written more correctly, and by an ode which had vainly contended for the prize be&s;towed by the French academy; to this a ridiculous piece written by the Abb&eacute; du Jarri had been preferred. The theme pro|po&s;ed by the academy was the decoration of the altar of Notre Dame; for Louis the XIVth, after having reigned &s;eventy years, recollected it was time to perform the pro|mi&s;e of Louis the XIIIth. Thus was the &s;ub|ject of the fir&s;t &s;erious poem, written by Vol|taire,
<PB N="15" REF="024210_0014_0FC55B4AF79FA790">
devotion. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of native and un|erring ta&s;te, he would not mingle the pa&s;&s;i|on of love with a tale &s;o horrid as that of Oedipus; and had been daring enough to pre&s;ent his piece to the theatre without ha|ving paid this tribute to cu&s;tom. But it was rejected. The a&s;&s;embled comedians took it ami&s;s that the author &s;hould dare to di&s;pute their judgment. "The young man well de&s;erves," &s;aid Dufre&s;ne, "as a pu|ni&s;hment for his pride, that his tragedy &s;hould be played with the long vile &s;cene which he has tran&s;lated from Sophocles."</P>
<P>Voltaire was obliged to cede, and to in|&s;ert a whole epi&s;ode of love. The piece was applauded, though in de&s;pight of the epi&s;ode; and the long vile &s;cene from So|phocles in&s;ured its &s;ucce&s;s. La Motto, who was at that time the fir&s;t among men of let|ters, &s;aid in his approbation that his tragedy gave promi&s;e of a worthy &s;uce&s;&s;or to Cor|neille and Racine; and the homage thus rendered by a rival, who&s;e fame was e&s;tab|li&s;hed, and who had rea&s;on to fear he might &s;ee him&s;elf &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, mu&s;t forever do ho|nour to the character of La Motte.</P>
<P>But Voltaire, proclaimed a man of genius and a philo&s;opher to a croud of inferior au|thors and fanatics of all &s;ects, even then gained a combination of enemies, whom the
<PB N="16" REF="024210_0015_0FC55B4BF92E9C60">
ri&s;ing generations of &s;ixty years have conti|nued to &s;upply, and who often have mole&s;t|ed his long and glorious career. The fol|lowing celebrated lines&mdash;

were the fir&s;t &s;ignal of a war, which not even the death of Voltaire could extingui&s;h.</P>
<P>At one of the repre&s;entations of Oedipus, Voltaire appeared on the &s;tage, bearing up the train of the high prie&s;t. The Marchione&s;s de Villars a&s;ked who was that young man who wi&s;hed the piece might be condemned; &s;he was told it was the author. This thought|le&s;s act, which &s;poke a man &s;o &s;uperior to the trifling anxieties of &s;elf-love, made the marchione&s;s de&s;irous of his acquaint|ance. Voltaire, being admitted her vi&s;itor, conceived a pa&s;&s;ion for her, the fir&s;t, and the mo&s;t &s;erious he ever felt, He was un&s;uc|ce&s;sful; and was for a con&s;iderable time diverted from &s;tudy, which had already be|come nece&s;&s;ary to his exi&s;tence. He never, afterwards, mentioned this &s;ubject but with a &s;en&s;ation of regret, and almo&s;t of re|mor&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="024210_0016_0FC55B4D7AB25E00">Having freed him&s;elf from his pa&s;&s;ion, he continued the Henriade; and wrote the tragedy of Art&eacute;mire. An actre&s;s, whom he had formed, and who was at once his mi&s;tre&s;s and his pupil, played the principal character. The public, who had done ju&s;|tice to Oedipus, was (to &s;ay the lea&s;t) &s;evere to Art&eacute;mire. This is a common con&s;equence of &s;ucce&s;s; nor is &s;ecret aver&s;ion for ac|knowledged &s;uperiority the only cau&s;e, tho' this aver&s;ion has the art to profit by a na|tural feeling which renders us more difficult to be plea&s;ed in proportion as we have more to hope.</P>
<P>This tragedy was of no other value to Voltaire than that of obtaining permi&s;&s;ion for him to return to Paris, whence he had been bani&s;hed by his intimacy with the en|emies of the regent, and among others with the Duke de Richelieu and the famous Baron de Gortz. Thus did this ambitious man, who&s;e va&s;t projects included all Europe, and threatened to overturn its governments, choo&s;e a young poet for his friend and almo&s;t for his confident. Men of genius &s;eek for, and at once know each other; they have a common language, which they alone can &s;peak and under&s;tand.</P>
<P>In 1722, Voltaire accompanied Madame de Rupelmonde into Holland. He was de&s;i|rous,
<PB N="18" REF="024210_0017_0FC55B55E52C9DE8">
at Bru&s;&s;els, of being acquainted with Rou&s;&s;eau, who&s;e misfortunes he pitied, and who&s;e poetic talent he e&s;teemed. The love of his art was too powerful for that ju&s;t contempt which he ought to have conceived for the character of Rou&s;&s;eau. Voltaire con&s;ulted him on his Poem on the League; and read his Epi&s;tle to Urania to him, writ|ten for Madame de Rupelmonde. This poem was the fir&s;t monument of his freedom of thinking, and of his talent of treating on moral and metaphy&s;ical &s;ubjects in ver&s;e, and of rendering them popular.</P>
<P>Rou&s;&s;eau, on his part, read an Ode ad|dre&s;&s;ed to Po&s;terity, which Voltaire, as it is pretended, then told him would never arrive at the place to which it was addre&s;&s;ed. He likewi&s;e read the Judgment of Pluto, which was as quickly forgotten as the ode. The two poets parted irreconcileable foes. Rou&s;&s;eau violently attacked Voltaire, who continued patiently to &s;uffer during fifteen years. It is a&s;toni&s;hing to think that the author of &s;o many licentious epigrams, in which the clergy were continually made the &s;ubject of ridicule and opprobium, &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;ign the thoughtle&s;s behaviour of Voltaire during ma&s;s and his Epi&s;tle to Ura|nia as the cau&s;e of his hatred. But Rou&s;&s;eau had a&s;&s;umed the ma&s;k of devotion, which

was then an honourable a&s;ylum for &s;uch as had &s;uffered in the world's opinion: a &s;afe and commodious a&s;ylum which philo&s;ophy, among the other evils of which it is accu&s;ed, has unfortunately, for hypocrites, eternally clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>In 1724, Voltaire pre&s;ented the world with Mariamne, which was but Art&eacute;mire under new names, but with a le&s;s compli|cated and le&s;s romantic fable. It was writ|ten in the very &s;tyle of Racine, and was forty times performed. In his preface, the author oppo&s;ed the opinion of La Motte, who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much under&s;tanding and rea&s;on, but little &s;en&s;ible of the charms of harmony, di&s;covered no other merit in ver|&s;ification than that of difficulties overcome; nor any thing more than a formal cu&s;tom, in poetry, invented to ea&s;e the memory, and to which habit alone had attributed charms. In his letters, printed at the end of Oedipus, he had before combated the opinions of the &s;ame poet, who regarded the ob&s;ervance of the three Unities as another prejudice.</P>
<P>We ought to think our&s;elves obliged to tho&s;e who, like La Motte, dare to oppo&s;e common and received opinions. In order to defend ancient rules, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be examined; and if received opinions, on examination, be found true, we enjoy
<PB N="20" REF="024210_0019_0FC55B628D1A62A8">
the advantage of believing that from rea&s;on to which we had previou&s;ly given our a&s;&s;ent from habit; if fal&s;e, the world is then freed from an error.</P>
<P>It is no uncommon thing, however, for men to be angry at tho&s;e who oblige them to &s;crutinize what had been admitted upon tru&s;t. The minds, which like that of Mon|taigne, quietly &s;lumber on the pillow of &s;cep|tici&s;m, are not common; and &s;till le&s;s com|mon are tho&s;e who are tormented by the de&s;ire of di&s;covering truth. The vulgar love to believe without proof; and to cheri&s;h their &s;ecurity in blind faith, as a thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary to their ea&s;e and &s;afety.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, the Henriade ap|peared under the name of the League: an imperfect copy, &s;tolen from the author, was clande&s;tinely printed, in which there were not only parts omitted, but &s;ome vacancies were &s;upplied.</P>
<P>Thus France was at la&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an Epic Poem. It mu&s;t be regretted, no doubt, that Voltaire, the fables of who&s;e tragedies are &s;o full of action, who has made the pa&s;|&s;ions &s;peak a language &s;o natural and &s;o true, and who could paint them &s;o effectually as well by analizing their &s;entiments as by their &s;udden ebullitions, &s;hould not have di&s;play|ed in the Henriade tho&s;e talents which ne|ver
<PB N="21" REF="024210_0020_0FC55B6426439BC8">
before were combined in the &s;ame man to &s;o great a degree. Yet, a &s;ubject &s;o well known and &s;o recent gave but little room for the imagination of the poet. The gloo|my and per&s;ecuting &s;pirit of fanatici&s;m, ex|erci&s;ing it&s;elf on &s;ubaltern characters, could excite little more than horror. The chiefs of the league were animated by an ambiti|on which hypocri&s;y deba&s;ed. The hero of the poem, gallant, brave, and humane, but continually &s;ubject to misfortune which a|lighted on him alone, could intere&s;t only by his courage and his clemency. Nor was it po&s;&s;ible that the unnatural conver&s;ion of Henry the IVth &s;hould form an heroic ca|ta&s;trophe.</P>
<P>But though the Henriade in pathos, vari|ety, and action, be inferior to tho&s;e epic poems which were then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of uni|ver&s;al admiration, yet by how many new beauties was this inferiority compen&s;ated? Never was philo&s;ophy, &s;o profound and &s;o true, embelli&s;hed by ver&s;es more &s;ublime or more affecting. What other poem pre|&s;ents to us characters drawn with greater &s;trength and dignity, and without offence to hi&s;torical facts? What other contains mo|rality more pure, humanity more enlight|ened, or is more free from the errors of prejudice and vulgar pa&s;&s;ion? Whether the
<PB N="22" REF="024210_0021_0FC55B72A9F53DD0">
poet cau&s;es his characters to act or &s;peak, whether he paints the crimes of fanatici&s;m, or the charms and the dangers of love, whether he tran&s;ports his hearer to the field of battle, or into that heaven which he him|&s;elf created, he is every where a philo&s;o|pher, and is every where deeply intent on promoting the true intere&s;ts of the human race. In the very palace of fiction, we behold truth &s;ublimely ri&s;e, and always painted in the mo&s;t &s;plendid and pure&s;t colours.</P>
<P>Of all epic poems the Henriade alone has a moral purport; not that it can be &s;aid to be the devellopement of one &s;ingle truth, which is a pedantic idea and to which a poet can|not &s;ubject him&s;elf, but becau&s;e it breathes throughout a dete&s;tation of war and fanati|ci&s;m, and a &s;pirit of toleration and huma|nity. Each poem nece&s;&s;arily wears the complexion of the age in which it took birth; and the birth of the Henriade was in the age of rea&s;on. Hence, the greater the progre&s;s of rea&s;on among mankind the great|er will be their admiration of this poem.</P>
<P>The Henriade may be compared to the Aeneid: both bear the &s;tamp of genius in whatever depended on the poet, and the defects of both are in the choice of the &s;ub|ject, which was mutually dictated by a na|tional &s;pirit. Virgil, however, intended on|ly
<PB N="23" REF="024210_0022_0FC55B76B7862C20">
to flatter Roman pride; but Voltaire had the more noble motive of pre&s;erving the French from fanatici&s;m, by a recapitulati|on of the crimes into which their ance&s;tors had been hurried.</P>
<P>The Henriade, Oedipus, and Mariamne had placed Voltaire much above his cotem|poraries; and &s;eemed to &s;ecure a life of fame, when his repo&s;e was troubled by a fatal accident. He had returned a &s;atyri|cal an&s;wer to &s;ome contemptuous words which had been &s;poken by a courtier, who revenged him&s;elf by cau&s;ing Voltaire to be in&s;ulted by his &s;ervants without endangering his per&s;onal &s;afety. The outrage was com|mitted at the gate of the Hotel de Sully, where he had dined; nor did the Duke de Sully deign to &s;how any re&s;entment; be|ing, no doubt, per&s;uaded that the de&s;cend|ants of the Franks had pre&s;erved the right of life and death over the Gauls. Ju&s;tice remained mute; the parliament of Paris, which had cau&s;ed far le&s;s mi&s;demeanours to be puni&s;hed when committed again&s;t one of its own &s;ubalterns, imagined nothing was due to an undignified citizen, although the greate&s;t man of literature the nation po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, and kept &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Voltaire was de&s;irous of taking tho&s;e means to revenge offended honour which
<PB N="24" REF="024210_0023_0FC55B7834E1AC88">
the manners of modern nations have au|thori&s;ed, but which their laws have pro|&s;cribed. The Ba&s;tile, and, at the end of &s;ix months, an order to quit Paris were the puni&s;hment of his fir&s;t &s;tep. The Car|dinal de Fleury had not &s;o much policy as even to denote the &s;lighte&s;t mark of di&s;&s;a|tisfaction again&s;t the aggre&s;&s;or. Thus when men are unprotected by the laws they are puni&s;hed by arbitrary power for &s;eeking that revenge, which the want of protection ren|ders legal, and which is pre&s;cribed as ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the principles of honour. We venture to believe that the rights of man will be more re&s;pected in our times, that the laws will not remain impotent from any ridiculous prejudice of birth, and that when any quarrel &s;hall happen between two citi|zens no mini&s;ter will deprive him who re|ceived the fir&s;t offence of his freedom.</P>
<P>Voltaire made a &s;ecret journey to Paris, but to no effect. He there met with more than one adver&s;ary, who di&s;po&s;ed at plea|&s;ure of judicial power and mini&s;terial au|thority, and who could &s;afely effect his ruin. He buried him&s;elf in retirement, and di&s;|dained longer to &s;eek revenge; or, rather, revenged him&s;elf by overwhelming his en|emy with the weight of his increa&s;ing fame, and forcing him to hear the name which he
<PB N="25" REF="024210_0024_0FC55B79BADFC318">
wi&s;hed to degrade ince&s;&s;antly repeated with acclamation throughout all Europe.</P>
<P>England was his place of refuge. Newton was no more; but his &s;pirit was infu&s;ed into his countrymen, whom he had taught to tru&s;t to experiment, and calculation only in the &s;tudy of nature. Locke, who&s;e death was likewi&s;e recent, had been the fir&s;t to give the theory of the human under&s;tanding founded on expe|ence, and to &s;how the path which may &s;afely be followed in metaphy&s;ical pur&s;uits. The philo&s;ophy of Shafte&s;bury, commented on by Bolingbroke, and embelli&s;hed by the ver&s;ifica|tion of Pope, had given birth in England to that dei&s;m which announced morality, found|ed on motives &s;uch as might affect great minds without offence to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>In France, mean time, the men of mo&s;t under&s;tanding were labouring to &s;ub&s;titute in our &s;chools the hypothe&s;is of Des Cartes, for the ab&s;urdities of &s;chola&s;tic philo&s;ophy. Any the&s;is, in which either the &s;y&s;tem of Copernicus or that of the Vortices was maintained, was a victory over prejudice. Innate ideas, in the eyes of the devout, were become almo&s;t an ar|ticle of faith; though they had at fir&s;t been &s;uppo&s;ed heretical. Malebranche, whom men imagined they under&s;tood, was the philo&s;o|pher in fa&s;hion. He was &s;uppo&s;ed a free-think|er, who allowed him&s;elf to regard the exi&s;t|ence of the five propo&s;itions, in the unintelligible book of Jan&s;enius, as a thing in which the hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="26" REF="024210_0025_0FC55B89FA249CF0">
of the human race was not concerned, or who had the temerity to read Bayle with|out the permi&s;&s;ion of a doctor in divinity.</P>
<P>This contra&s;t could not but excite the enthu|&s;ia&s;m of a man, who, like Voltaire, had from his infancy &s;haken off prejudice. The example of England &s;howed him that truth was not formed to remain in &s;ecret among a few phi|lo&s;ophers, and men of the world, the pupils of the&s;e philo&s;ophers; who laughed with them at tho&s;e errors of which the people are the victims, but became them&s;elves the defenders of error, when their office or their rank made it their intere&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ed or real, and were ready to pro&s;cribe or even to per&s;ecute their preceptors, &s;hould they venture to &s;peak what they them&s;elves privately believed.</P>
<P>From this moment, Voltaire felt him&s;elf called to be the de&s;troyer of prejudice of eve|ry kind, of which his country was the &s;lave. He felt the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucceeding by a happy mixture of boldne&s;s and pliabilty, by know|ing when to recede and when to advance, by artfully and alternately employing rea&s;on, ri|dicule, the charms of poetry, and theatrical ef|fect, and by &s;implifying truth &s;o as to render it popular, amiable, and fa&s;hionable, without of|fence to frivolity. This good project, of ren|dering him&s;elf, by the force of his own genius, the benefactor of a whole nation, whence he meant to bani&s;h error, &s;ired the mind of Vol|taire, and in&s;pired him with fortitude. He &s;wore to this to con&s;ecrate his life; and he
<PB N="27" REF="024210_0026_0FC55B8DC165F0D0">
kept his vow. The tragedy of Brutus was the fir&s;t fruits of his journey to England.</P>
<P>The French theatre had not, &s;ince Cinna, breathed the haughty accents of freedom; and they had, there, been &s;mothered by tho&s;e of revenge. In Brutus, the &s;trength of Cor|neille was di&s;covered with additional pomp and &s;plendor, combined with that &s;implicity which Corneille wanted, and the uniform elegance of Racine. Never were the rights of an oppre&s;&s;ed people di&s;played with greater power, eloquence and even preci&s;ion, than in the &s;econd &s;cene of Brutus. The fifth act is equally remarkable for its pathos. The poet has been reproached for having made love a part of a &s;ubject &s;o awful and terrible, and particularly love, which is deficient in intere&s;t; but, had the motive of Titus been any other than love, he would have been deba&s;ed, the &s;everity of Bru|tus would not then have rent the hearts of the &s;pectators; and, had love been rendered too pathetic, it would have been to be feared that love would have de&s;troyed the cau&s;e of liberty. It was after this piece had been acted that Fon|tenelle told Voltaire "He did not think his genius proper for tragedy, and that his &s;tyle was too bold, pompous, and &s;plendid."&mdash;"If &s;o," replied Voltaire, "I will go and read your pa&s;torals."</P>
<P>He &s;uppo&s;ed, at this time, he might a&s;pire to a place in the French academy; and he might well have been thought mode&s;t to have
<PB N="28" REF="024210_0027_0FC55B8F78D91DA8">
waited &s;o long. But he had not &s;o much as the honour of dividing the votes of the acade|micians. The fat De Bo&s;e pronounced in a dictatorial tone, that Voltaire &s;hould never be one of their dignified members.</P>
<P>This De Bo&s;e, who&s;e name is now forgotten, was one of the&s;e men, who, with little mind, and not too much knowledge, obtain admi&s;&s;i|on among men of rank and power, and &s;uc|ceed preci&s;ely becau&s;e they have neither the wit to in&s;pire fear, nor to humble the &s;elf-love of tho&s;e who &s;eek the reputation of patroni&s;ing men of letters. De Bo&s;e was become a per|&s;on of importance. He exerci&s;ed the office of in&s;pector of new publications; which is an u&s;urpation on the part of the magi&s;trate, over men of letters, to whom the avidity of the rich and the powerful have left no employments but tho&s;e who&s;e execution requires the exer|tion of knowledge and talents.</P>
<P>After Brutus, Voltaire wrote the Death of Cae&s;ar; a &s;ubject which had previou&s;ly been cho&s;en by Shak&s;pere, &s;ome &s;cenes of whom he imitated and embelli&s;hed. The tragedy was not played till &s;everal years had elap&s;ed, and then in a college; he dur&s;t not ri&s;k a piece on the &s;tage, de&s;titute of love and of women, and which was likewi&s;e a tragedy in three acts: for it is not the mo&s;t trifling innovations which ex|cite the lea&s;t clamour among the enemies of novelty; little things nece&s;&s;arily impre&s;s them|&s;elves on little minds. Still, however, a bold,
<PB N="29" REF="024210_0028_0FC55B912571C8F0">
noble, and figurative, yet natural, &s;tyle, &s;enti|ments worthy of the conqueror of the free&s;t people on earth, and that force and grandeur of character, and deep thought which pervade the language of the&s;e la&s;t Romans, could not but be felt by &s;pectators capable of di&s;covering &s;uch merit, and men who&s;e hearts and minds were related to the&s;e great per&s;onages, as well as by tho&s;e who might love hi&s;tory, and &s;uch young minds as, in the cour&s;e of education, had lately been occupied by &s;imilar objects.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torical tragedies, &s;uch as Cinna, the death of Pompey, Brutus, Rome Pre&s;erved, and the Triumvirate, of Voltaire, cannot be equally intere&s;ting with the Cid, Iphigene, Za&iuml;re, or Merope. The mild and tender pa&s;&s;ions can|not di&s;play them&s;elves in conformity with hi&s;|torical fact; incidents cannot be &s;o &s;elected and di&s;po&s;ed as to produce theatrical effect with equal &s;ucce&s;s; the poet has not the &s;ame power over the characters; the general inte|re&s;t, which is that of a people, or of a &s;tate rather than of an individual, is rendered le&s;s forcible, becau&s;e it is dependent on &s;entiments le&s;s energetic.</P>
<P>But, far from &s;tigmati&s;ing this &s;pecies of writing, as the colde&s;t and mo&s;t unfavourable to dramatic genius, it ought to be encourag|ed; becau&s;e it opens a va&s;t field for the poet, in which he may unfold all the &s;ublime truths of politics; becau&s;e it di&s;plays grand hi&s;torical pictures; and becau&s;e, by the&s;e means, the
<PB N="30" REF="024210_0029_0FC55B993AB3B9A8">
&s;oul may mo&s;t effectually be formed and eleva|ted. We, doubtle&s;s, ought to place the&s;e a|mong the fir&s;t of poems, which, like Maho|met and Alzire, are at once exten&s;ive, and abounding with pathos and terror. But the&s;e are uncommon &s;ubjects, and require the exer|tion of talents, which no poet but Voltaire has hitherto po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Death of Cae&s;ar was not allowed to be printed: the republican &s;entiments it contain|ed were attributed as crimes to the author. This was a ridiculous imputation; each cha|racter &s;poke its own language; and Brutus was not more the hero than Cae&s;ar; the poet, treat|ing an hi&s;torical &s;ubject, drew his portraits af|ter hi&s;tory, with &s;trict impartiality. But, un|der the government of the Cardinal de Fleury, which was at once tyrannical and pu&s;illanimous, the language of &s;lavery alone could appear to be innocent.</P>
<P>Who could, at pre&s;ent, &s;uppo&s;e that the eu|logy on the death of Mademoi&s;elle le Couvreur could have been made a &s;ubject of &s;erious per|&s;ecution, and have obliged Voltaire to quit the metropolis, where he knew that ab&s;ence would fortunately cau&s;e all things to be forgotten, and even the frenzy of per&s;ecution?</P>
<P>The theatre is truly a u&s;eful in&s;titution, at which even indolent and frivolous youth pre|&s;erve &s;omething of the habit of feeling and of thinking, while moral ideas are not totally lo&s;t to their minds, and the plea&s;ures of the imagi|nation
<PB N="31" REF="024210_0030_0FC55BA34F033F18">
are &s;till felt to exi&s;t. The &s;en&s;ations which the repre&s;entation of a tragedy excite, purify the &s;oul, and rai&s;e it from that apathy and egoti&s;m which are the maladies to which the di&s;&s;ipated are, in the nature of things, con|demned. Such exhibitions form a kind of connexion between the two cla&s;&s;es of men who do, and men who do not, think. They &s;oft|en the au&s;terity of the one; and, in the other, temper that want of feeling which is the child of thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s and pride. It is a &s;ingular fatality that in a country, in which the drama|tic art has been carried to the highe&s;t degree of perfection, the actors, to whom the public are indebted for the noble&s;t of their plea&s;ures, &s;hould be condemned by religion, and &s;hun|ned from the mo&s;t ridiculous of prejudices.</P>
<P>The&s;e prejudices Voltaire hardily oppo&s;ed. Indignant to behold an actre&s;s, who had long been the object of enthu&s;ia&s;tic applau&s;e, after being carried off by a &s;udden and cruel death deprived of the rites of burial, becau&s;e in a &s;tate of excommunication, he loudly reproach|ed a frivolous nation which with cowardice bent the neck under &s;o &s;hameful a yoke, and the pu&s;illanimity of tho&s;e people in power who peaceably &s;uffered the memory of her whom they had &s;o much admired to be thus in&s;ulted. Though nations are &s;low to correct them&s;elves, they &s;till &s;uffer them&s;elves to be told of their faults with patience. But the prie&s;ts, whom the parliaments would &s;uffer to excommuni|cate

none but wizards and players, were irri|tated to &s;ee a poet dare to di&s;pute the half of their empire, and the people in power could not pardon him for having proclaimed their unworthy cowardice.</P>
<P>Voltaire felt that &s;ome great theatrical &s;uc|ce&s;s could alone &s;ecure him the hearts of the public, and &s;hield him from the attacks of fa|nataci&s;m. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a country, in which no popular power exi&s;ts, each cla&s;s has &s;ome point at which to rally and form it&s;elf into a &s;pecies of pow|er. A dramatic author is under the protec|tion of tho&s;e &s;ocieties who re&s;ort to the theatre for amu&s;ement. The public, by applauding allu&s;ions, flatter or offend the vanity of men in office, di&s;courage or re-animate their oppo|nents, and cannot for this rea&s;on be openly de|fied. Voltaire, therefore, pre&s;ented his Eu|riphile, which did not effect his purpo&s;e; but, far from being di&s;couraged by want of &s;ucce&s;s, and delighted with the &s;ubject of Za&iuml;re, he fi|ni&s;hed that tragedy in eighteen days, and it made its appearance on the &s;tage four months after Euriphile.</P>
<P>Its &s;ucce&s;s &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his hopes. This was the fir&s;t piece in which, for&s;aking the tract of Corneille and Racine, he di&s;covered art, &s;tyle, and talents entirely his own. Never did love more true or more impa&s;&s;ioned draw tears more &s;weet; never did poet before &s;o depict the fury of jealou&s;y in a mind &s;o &s;imple, &s;o af|fectionate, and &s;o generous.

And even, were it po&s;&s;ible to forget Oro&s;manes and Za&iuml;re, how awful is irreligion in the per&s;on of the aged Lu&s;ignan? How no|ble is the &s;pirit of fanatici&s;m, which the re|proaches of Nare&s;tam breathe? With what art has the poet painted the Chri&s;tians who&s;e interference di&s;turb &s;o &s;weet an union, a feel|ing and pious woman who has &s;acrificed her life and her love to her God, while the man who believes not in Chri&s;tianity weeps for Za&iuml;re, who&s;e mind is di&s;tracted by filial affection, and who is the willing victim of a &s;uper&s;titious pre|judice, which forbids her to love a man of a different &s;ect. This is a ma&s;ter-piece of art. Whoever does not believe in the Old Te&s;ta|ment, di&s;covers in Athalia nothing but the &s;chool of bigotry, fal&s;ehood, and murder; but to all &s;ects, and in all countries, Za&iuml;re is the tragedy of the feeling and the innocent heart.</P>
<P>This tragedy was followed by that of Ade|laide de Gue&s;clin, which had likewi&s;e love for its &s;ubject, and in which, as in Za&iuml;re, French heroes and French hi&s;tory were recited in beautiful poetry: &s;o as to increa&s;e the intere&s;t.

<PB N="35" REF="024210_0034_0FC55BB36B731F88">
from the unfortunate habits attending on de&s;|potic power. Tender and di&s;intere&s;ted in his affection, Oro&s;manes renders him&s;elf guilty during that momentary frenzy into which he is hurried by excu&s;able error, and puni&s;hes by &s;a|crificing him&s;elf. Vend&ocirc;me, more per&s;onal and rather the &s;lave of his pa&s;&s;ion than of his mi&s;tre&s;s, protects his crime with a more tran|quil fury, but expiates it by his remor&s;e and the &s;acrifice of his love. The one exhibits tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es and &s;ufferings into which the vi|olence of de&s;pair plunges the generous &s;oul; and the other, the power of repentant virtue over the &s;trong mind, which had previou&s;ly abandoned it&s;elf to pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that the &s;ucce&s;s of Adelaide was in|jured by the Temple of Ta&s;te, in which charm|ing work Voltaire had pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence on the writers of the pa&s;t age, and even on &s;ome of his cotemporaries. Time has confirmed all his deci&s;ions, which each then appeared &s;acrilegi|ous. In ob&s;erving &s;uch literary intolerance, the nece&s;&s;ity, under which every writer labours who wi&s;hes to live in peace, of re&s;pecting opi|nions already formed of the merit of an orator or a poet, and the fury with which the public pur&s;ues tho&s;e who dare, even on the mo&s;t indif|ferent &s;ubjects, to think differently from them|&s;elves, we &s;hould be tempted to imagine that man is intolerant by Nature. Wit, rea&s;on, and genius cannot always guard us again&s;t this mi&s;|fortune. There are few men who have not &s;ome &s;ecret idols, the wor&s;hip of which they cannot calmly &s;ee de&s;troyed.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="024210_0035_0FC55BBB1C5D5658">Pride and envy is frequently the origin of this &s;en&s;ation.

<P>Voltaire had, in his retirement, conceived the happy plan of bringing his nation acquaint|ed with the philo&s;ophy, the literature, the opi|nions, and the &s;ects of England; to effect which, he wrote his Letters on the Engli&s;h Nation. Newton, who&s;e philo&s;ophic opinions, who&s;e &s;y&s;|tem of the earth, and who&s;e optical experi|ments were &s;carcely known in France; Locke who&s;e E&s;&s;ay on the Human Under&s;tanding, tran&s;lated into French, had only been read by a few philo&s;ophers; Bacon, the extent of who&s;e fame was that he had been lord chancellor; Shak&s;pere who&s;e genius and gro&s;s errors form a phenomenon in the hi&s;tory of literature; Congreve, Wicherly, Addi&s;on, and Pope, who&s;e names were almo&s;t unknown even by our men of letters; the bigoted Quakers, who, without being per&s;ecutors, were fanatics in their de|votion,
<PB N="37" REF="024210_0036_0FC55BBC8207C680">
yet the mo&s;t rational of Chri&s;tians in their creed and in their morals, ridiculous in the eyes of the world, for having carried two virtues to exce&s;s, the love of peace and the love of equality; the other &s;ects by which En|gland was divided; the influence which a ge|neral &s;pirit of freedom had there obtained over literature, philo&s;ophy, arts, opinions, and man|ners; and the practice of inoculation which had been examined without prejudice, and met with few impediments, notwith&s;tanding the &s;in|gularity and the innovation of the practice: &s;uch were the principal &s;ubjects of his work.</P>
<P>Fontenelle was the fir&s;t who made rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy &s;peak an agreeable and inviting language: he had the art to mingle reflexi|ons, &s;age, delicate, and frequently profound, with the &s;ciences. In the Letters of Voltaire we di&s;cover the merit of Fontenelle, with more ta&s;te, &s;implicity, boldne&s;s, and gaiety. No rooted attachment to the errors of Des Cartes interfered, to &s;pread a &s;hadow over, and to disfigure, truth. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the logic and plea&s;antry of the Lettres Provinciales<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By Pa&s;cal.</NOTE>, but ex|erci&s;ed them on greater &s;ubjects; nor were they injured by a varni&s;h of monki&s;h devotion.</P>
<P>This work was the aera of a revolution in France; it gave ri&s;e to a ta&s;te for philo&s;ophy, and Engli&s;h literature; it intere&s;ted us in the manners, policy, and commercial knowledge of
<PB N="38" REF="024210_0037_0FC55BBE608AC3C8">
that nation; and it brought us acquainted with the Engli&s;h language. A puerile partia|lity afterward took place of former indiffer|ence; and, by a remarkable &s;ingularity, Vol|taire had the glory of combating it, and of dimini&s;hing its influence. He had taught us to feel the merit of Shak&s;pere, and to regard his works as a mine, whence trea&s;ures might be dug by our poets; and, when a ridiculous enthu&s;ia&s;m pre&s;ented this eloquent, but wild and capricious poet, as a model to a nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Racine and Voltaire, and wi&s;hed us to con&s;ider his canva&s;s, overcharged with ab&s;ur|dity and gro&s;s caricature, as the energetic and true pictures of nature, Voltaire defended the cau&s;e of ta&s;te and rea&s;on. He had fir&s;t ex|claimed again&s;t the too great timitidy of our theatre, and was afterward obliged to exclaim again&s;t our inclination to imitate the licenti|ous barbarity of the Engli&s;h &s;tage.</P>
<P>The publication of the&s;e letters excited per|&s;ecution, the bitterne&s;s of which, to read them at pre&s;ent, could &s;carcely be conceived: but innate ideas were oppo&s;ed in them, and our doctors of that day believed, if there were no innate ideas, there would be no &s;ufficiently marked characters to di&s;tingui&s;h between the &s;ouls of men and of brutes. Be&s;ides, it was there maintained, after Locke, that there was no &s;trict proof that God had not the power, if he had the will, to impart to matter the fa|culty of thinking. This was to infringe on the
<PB N="39" REF="024210_0038_0FC55BCCC3A65768">
privilege of the divines, who pretended to know accurately and exactly, they and they alone, all that God has thought, and all that he could do, or has done, &s;ince, and even before, the beginning of the world.</P>
<P>In fine, Voltaire critici&s;ed &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the thoughts of Pa&s;cal: a work which the Je|&s;uits, in their own de&s;pite, were obliged to re|&s;pect as much as the works of St. Augu&s;tin. It gave &s;candalous offence to &s;ee a poet, nay more, a layman, dare to &s;it in judgment on Pa&s;cal. It appeared to be an attack on the only defender of the Chri&s;tian religion, who, among the fa&s;hionable world, had the reputa|tion of being a great man. It was to attack religion it&s;elf: and how much would the proofs of religion be weakened, &s;hould the mathema|tician, Pa&s;cal, who had openly devoted him&s;elf to its defence, be convicted of having often rea&s;oned ill.</P>
<P>The clergy demanded that the Letters on the Engli&s;h Nation &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and they were &s;o, by an arret of council. The&s;e arrets were given, without examination, as a kind of retribution, for the &s;ub&s;idy which go|vernment obtained from the a&s;&s;emblies of the clergy; and as a reward for the facility with which they were granted. Mini&s;ters for|got that the intere&s;t of the &s;ecular power was not to &s;upport, but to &s;uffer the progre&s;s of rea&s;on to de&s;troy, that empire of the prie&s;t|hood which has been &s;o long and &s;o bar|barou&s;ly

<P>The parliament burnt the book, according to a cu&s;tom formerly invented by Tiberius, and rendered ridiculous &s;ince the invention of print|ing. But there are certain people for whom the experience of three ages are nece&s;&s;ary, be|fore they can begin to perceive ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>So much per&s;ecution, exerci&s;ed at the very time when the miracles of the Abb&eacute; Paris and tho&s;e of Father Girard were acting, loaded the two per&s;ecuting parties with ridicule and op|probrium. It was natural that they &s;hould unite again&s;t a man who daringly preached rea&s;on; and they went &s;o far as to order informations to be i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the author of the Letters. The keeper of the &s;eals bani&s;hed Voltaire, who, being at that time ab&s;ent, received early infor|mation, and avoided the people &s;ent to con|duct him to the place of his exile; rather choo&s;ing to combat at a di&s;tance, and where he could be in &s;afety. His friends proved that he had not forfeited his promi&s;e, not to pub|li&s;h his Letters in France; and that they had made their appearance from the treachery of a book-binder. Fortunately, the keeper of the &s;eals had more zeal for his authority than for religion, and was much more of a mini&s;ter than of a devotee. The &s;torm was hu&s;hed, and Voltaire had permi&s;&s;ion to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">turn to Paris.</P>
<P>This calm was but of momentary duration.

The epi&s;tle to Urania, which, till then, had been kept in &s;ecret, was printed; and Voltaire, to e&s;cape a new per&s;ecution, was obliged to di&s;|avow and attribute it to the Abb&eacute; de Chaulieu, who had been dead &s;everal years.

<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of fal&s;ehood, in di&s;avowing a work, is an act of extremity, alike repugnant to con&s;cience and to dignity of character; but the crime is in the inju&s;tice of tho&s;e men who render &s;uch a di&s;avowal nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afe|ty of the author.

<P>We do not di&s;culpate Voltaire, for having attributed his work to the Abb&eacute; de Chaulieu, but &s;uch an imputation is in it&s;elf indifferent, and a mere act of plea&s;antry; it is affording an ex|cu&s;e to people in power, who are di&s;po&s;ed to be indulgent, without daring to confe&s;s them|&s;elves &s;o, by the aid of which they may repel

<P>At a time when there was much conver&s;a|tion concerning a man who had been arre&s;ted by a &s;uppo&s;ed forged lettre de cachet, Voltaire
<PB N="43" REF="024210_0042_0FC55BE527096498">

<P>Wearied by &s;o much per&s;ecution, Voltaire thought it nece&s;&s;ary to change his mode of life, to effect which, fortune &s;ecured him the means. Ancient philo&s;ophers have vaunted of poverty as the &s;afe-guard of independence: Voltaire, that he might be independent, wi&s;hed to become rich; and he was equally to be commended. The ancients were unacquainted with that &s;e|cret wealth which may at once be di&s;per&s;ed and &s;ecured, in various countries, beyond the reach of power. Confi&s;cation and its abu&s;es, among&s;t them, rendered wealth as dangerous as fame, or popular favour. The extent of the Roman empire, and the &s;mallne&s;s of the Grecian republics, alike prevented men from the concealment of their riches, or their per|&s;ons. The difference of manners among neigh|bouring nations, the almo&s;t general ignorance of foreign languages, and a le&s;s degree of in|tercour&s;e throughout the world, were then &s;o many impediments to a change of country.</P>
<P>The ancients likewi&s;e knew le&s;s of the con|veniencies of life, which among us are become nece&s;&s;ary to all who are not born in poverty. Their climate &s;ubjected them to le&s;s nume|rous real wants; and the wealthy were more
<PB N="44" REF="024210_0043_0FC55BE741BFD870">
addicted to magnificence, refinement in de|bauchery, exce&s;s, and caprice, than to habitu|al and daily convenience. Thus, as it was more ea&s;y for them to be poor, and more dif|ficult to be rich without danger, riches were not among them, as among us, the means of e&s;caping from unju&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Let us not blame a philo&s;opher for having, in order to &s;ecure his independence, preferred &s;uch re&s;ources as the manners of his age &s;up|plied to tho&s;e which belong to other manners and to other times.</P>
<P>The fortune which de&s;cended to Voltaire from his father and his brother was ample, and had been increa&s;ed by the London edition of the Henriade, and fortunate &s;peculations in the public funds. Thus, to the advantage of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing wealth, which a&s;certained independ|ence, he added that of being indebted for it to him&s;elf. The u&s;e he made of riches might prevail on envy it&s;elf to pardon him their ac|quirement.</P>
<P>Much of his wealth was expended in aiding men of letters, and in encouraging &s;uch youth as he thought di&s;covered the &s;eeds of ge|nius. This, in particular, was the applica|tion he made of the trifling profits he derived from his works and his theatrical productions, when he did not make a free gift of the latter to the comedians. Yet never was author more cruelly accu&s;ed of injuries done to his book&s;el|lers; but the whole &s;w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rm of literary in&s;ects
<PB N="45" REF="024210_0044_0FC55BE8B639B2D8">
were at their command, and were them&s;elves anxious to decry the conduct of a man who&s;e works they were con&s;cious they could not bring into di&s;repute. The pride of mediocrity, the vanity of men, even of merit, wounded by a too inconte&s;tible &s;uperiority, the bu&s;y world ever anxious to degrade knowledge and ta|lents which are the objects of their &s;ecret en|vy, and fanatics who were intere&s;ted to calum|niate Voltaire, that they might have the le&s;s to fear, all con&s;pired to increa&s;e the detrac|tion of book&s;ellers and hyper-critics. But proofs of the fal&s;ehood of the&s;e imputations, as well as the favours heaped by Voltaire on &s;ome of his detractors, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t; nor can we re|member the&s;e proofs without a &s;igh, at the misfortune of genius thus condemned to &s;uffer, and at that &s;hameful facility men have to credit whatever can relieve them from the ne|ne&s;&s;ity of admiring. Such &s;ighs are the me|lancholy retribution of &s;ame.</P>
<P>Having no more need, for the &s;ecurity of his fortune, to court patronage, &s;olicit places, or to traffic with book&s;ellers, Voltaire renounc|ed all re&s;idence at the capital. Previous to the admini&s;tration of Cardinal de Fleury, and his journey to England, his intercour&s;e had been among people of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion. Princes and nobles, tho&s;e who were at the head of affairs, people of fa&s;hion and women mo&s;t in vogue, were courted by him and were equally de&s;i|rous of his company. He was every where re|ceived
<PB N="46" REF="024210_0045_0FC55BF2B13BBAB0">
with plea&s;ure and welcome, but he eve|ry where in&s;pired envy and fear. Superior, in genius, he was even more &s;o, in the wit of conver&s;ation, into which he infu&s;ed whatever can render frivolity amiable, and at the &s;ame time inter&s;per&s;ed traits of a more elevated na|ture. Born with the talent of humour, his repartees were often repeated; nor was there any want of an application of the word ma|lignant, to what was no more than the deci&s;ion of the under&s;tanding, rendered acute by native wit.</P>
<P>On his return from England, he felt that in &s;ociety, where men a&s;&s;emble from motives of va|nity and &s;elf-love, he &s;hould meet but with few friends. He therefore, though he did not quarrel with &s;uch &s;ocieties, frequented them le&s;s. The ta&s;te he had acquired for magnifi|cence, grandeur, and whatever is uncommon and &s;plendid, had become habitual, and he pre|&s;erved it even in retirement. By this ta&s;te, his works were often embelli&s;hed, and it oc|ca&s;ionally influenced his judgment. On his re|turn to his country, he confined him&s;elf to live familiarly with only a few friends. He had lo&s;t M. de G&eacute;nonville and M. de Mai&s;ons, who&s;e death he lamented in &s;uch affecting ver&s;e, which remains a monument of that true and deep &s;en&s;ibility which nature had be&s;towed, and genius di&s;&s;eminated through his works, and which was the fortunate origin of his ardent zeal for the happine&s;s of mankind, which was
<PB N="47" REF="024210_0046_0FC55BFB34EEFAC8">
the &s;ublime and continued pa&s;&s;ion of his old age. He &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed M. d'Argental, who, du|ring his long life, pre&s;erved &s;en&s;ations of affec|tion and admiration for Voltaire, and who was rewarded by his friend&s;hip and his confidence. Madame Forment and Madame Cideville were likewi&s;e his friends, and the con&s;idants of his works and his projects.</P>
<P>But about the time when he &s;uffered &s;uch various per&s;ecution, friend&s;hip, &s;till more ten|der, afforded him con&s;olation and increa&s;ed his love of retirement. The Marchione&s;s du Chatelet was, like him, pa&s;&s;ionately enamour|ed of &s;tudy and fame, as well as of philo&s;ophy; but it was of that kind of philo&s;ophy which &s;prings up in the &s;trong and free mind. She had &s;tudied metaphy&s;ics and geometry &s;uffici|ently to analize Leibnitz, and tran&s;late Newton. She cultivated the arts; but not undi&s;tingui&s;h|ingly, nor &s;o as to prefer them to the knowledge of nature and man. Superior to prejudice, as well from &s;trength of character as from rea&s;on, &s;he had not the weakne&s;s to conceal how much prejudice was de&s;pi&s;ed by her. In|dulging in the trifling amu&s;ements of her &s;ex, rank, and age, &s;he yet could contemn and aban|don them without regret in favour of retire|ment, labour, and friend&s;hip. Her &s;uperior|ity excited the jealou&s;y of women and even of mo&s;t of the men, with whom &s;he nece&s;&s;arily a&s;&s;ociated. Yet &s;he could pardon their envy without an effort. Such was the friend that
<PB N="48" REF="024210_0047_0FC55BFC4168D318">
Voltaire &s;elected with whom to pa&s;s his days; days which were ever con&s;ecrated to works of genius, and embelli&s;hed by mutual friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Weary of literary di&s;putes, di&s;gu&s;ted to &s;ee the league which inferior writers had formed again&s;t him, and who were &s;ecretly &s;upported by men, who&s;e merit &s;hould have pre&s;erved them from &s;uch unworthy a&s;&s;ociates; finding likewi&s;e, that &s;ince he had dared to &s;peak truth, his accu&s;ers were as numerous as his critics, and perceiving that they ince&s;&s;antly armed religion and government again&s;t him, becau&s;e he was a good poet, he &s;ought employment more peaceful in the &s;tudy of the &s;ciences.</P>
<P>He determined to publi&s;h an elementary Treati&s;e of the Di&s;coveries of Newton, rela|tive to the &s;y&s;tem of the earth and of light, that he might render them f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">miliar to all who had the &s;lighte&s;t knowledge of mathematics; and that he might make known, at the &s;ame time, the philo&s;ophic opinions of Newton, and his ideas of ancient chronology.</P>
<P>At the time that the&s;e Elements appeared, the Carte&s;ian &s;y&s;tem prevailed even in the Academy of Sciences, at Paris. A few young geometricians only had the courage to for&s;ake it; nor did any work exi&s;t in the French lan|guage from which an idea could be formed of the grand di&s;coveries which had, for half a century, been rendered public in England.</P>
<P>The author, however, was refu&s;ed a privi|lege for publication. The Chancellor d'Agu|e&s;&s;eau
<PB N="49" REF="024210_0048_0FC55BFDD2AE0B20" MS="y">
was a Carte&s;ian in his youth, becau&s;e the &s;y&s;tem was then fa&s;hionable among &s;uch as pique them&s;elves on ri&s;ing &s;uperior to vulgar prejudice; and, to the&s;e his philo&s;ophical opi|nions, were added <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his political and religious &s;entiments again&s;t Newton. He di&s;covered that a chancellor of France ought not to &s;uffer an Engli&s;h philo&s;opher, who &s;carcely was a Chri&s;tian, to ri&s;e victorious over a &s;uppo&s;ed orthodox Frenchman. D'Ageu&s;&s;eau had a prodigious memory, and continued &s;tudy had rendered him deeply learned in various &s;pecies of erudition; but his mind, wearied by being made the receptacle of the opinions of others, had neither &s;trength &s;ufficient to combine his own ideas, nor to form fixt and definite prin|ciples. His &s;uper&s;tition, his timidity, his re|&s;pect for ancient cu&s;toms, and his want of re&s;olution, narrowed his views relative to a reformation of the laws and impeded his activ|ity. He died, after having been long a mini&s;ter, and left France to regret that his great virtues had &s;lumbered in inutility, and that his rare qualities had been lo&s;t to the world.</P>
<P>His &s;everity re&s;pecting the Elements of the Newtonian Philo&s;ophy was not the only mark of littlene&s;s he &s;howed during his cen&s;or&s;hip of the pre&s;s.

<Q><L>Ignis ubique latet naturam amplectitur omnem,</L>

<P>The prize was given to the illu&s;trious Eular, by whom, in &s;cientific conte&s;t, no man need blu&s;h at being vanqui&s;hed. Madame du Cha|lelet, as well as her friend, was likewi&s;e a candidate, and both pieces were mentioned in very honourable terms.</P>
<P>The di&s;pute on the mea&s;ure of forces at that time occupied mathematicians. Voltaire, in a memorial pre&s;ented to and approved by the Academy, took the part of Des Cartes and Newton again&s;t Leibnitz and the two Bernou|illi's; nay even again&s;t Madame du Chatelet, who was become the parti&s;an of Leibnitz.</P>
<P>We are far from pretending that the&s;e works are any addition to the &s;ame of Voltaire, or even that they de&s;erve a place among the learned, but the merit of having made the French, who are not mathematicians, acquaint|ed with Newton, the true &s;y&s;tem of the earth, and the principal phenomena of optics, de&s;erves notice in the life of a philo&s;opher.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="024210_0050_0FC55C11505EA898">It is good to di&s;&s;eminate truth relative to objects of &s;cience, whether it relate to the great laws of nature and the order of the world, or to tho&s;e common facts which fall under every man's ob&s;ervation.

The philo|&s;ophic knowledge of Voltaire was further u&s;e|ful to him as a poet; we do not, here, entirely refer to tho&s;e pieces in which he had the rare merit of expre&s;&s;ing truth in ver&s;e with preci|&s;ion without disfiguring it, or cea&s;ing to be a poet, or of addre&s;&s;ing the imagination while he delighted the ear. The &s;tudy of the scien|ces enlarges the &s;phere of poetic ideas, and enriches ver&s;e with new images. Without this re&s;ource, poetry, nece&s;&s;arily limitted by too confined a circle, would be no more than the art of re-producing, in harmonious language, com|mon thoughts and exhau&s;ted pictures.</P>

<P>He was not therefore entirely ab&s;orbed in the &s;ciences during his re&s;idence at Cirey.

<P>Alzire and Mahomet are immortal monu|ments of the height to which the human geni|us, poetry and philo&s;ophy can rai&s;e the tragic art.

<P>But the mo&s;t fatal of prejudices is that of fanatici&s;m. Voltaire was determined the mon|&s;ter &s;hould become the victim of the &s;tage; and that he might expel it from every heart, he employed the&s;e terrible effects which trage|dy alone can afford.

by the dramatic art, when employed by the true poet.</P>
<P>Mahomet was fir&s;t acted at Li&s;le, in l741. During the repre&s;entation, a letter from the king of Pru&s;&s;ia was delivered to Voltaire, which informed him of the victory of Molwitz. He &s;topped the piece to read the letter to the au|ditors. You will &s;ee, &s;aid he, to his &s;urround|ing friends, this tragedy of Molwitz will make mine &s;ucce&s;sful. They ventured to play it at Paris; but the bigots by their exclamations, availing them&s;elves of the weakne&s;s of the Cardinal de Fleury, prevailed on him to &s;or|bid the repre&s;entation. Voltaire thought pro|per to &s;end it to Benedict XIV. with two Latin ver&s;es for his portrait. The Pontiff Lamber|tini, a tolerant and ea&s;y prince, but a man of much under&s;tanding, &s;ent him a kind an&s;wer, accompanied by &s;ome medals.</P>
<P>Cr&eacute;billon was more &s;crupulous than the pope. He never would con&s;ent that a piece &s;hould be played, which, by proving that tragic terror may be increa&s;ed to the utmo&s;t exce&s;s without &s;acrificing the pathos or revolting the mind, was a &s;atire on that &s;pecies of writing, of which he proudly believed him&s;elf to be the creator and the model. It was not till the year 1751 that M. D'Alembert, being appointed by M. D'Argen&s;on to examine Mahomet, had the courage to approve it, and thus to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the mutual hatred of the men of let|ters leauged again&s;t Voltaire, and of the de|votees.

His fortitude was the more de&s;erving of re&s;pect, becau&s;e the approver of a work docs not participate in its fame, and becau&s;e he could find no recompence for the danger to which he expo&s;ed him&s;elf, except the plea|&s;ure of having &s;erved his friend, and aided the triumph of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Zulima failed of &s;ucce&s;s; nor were the ef|forts of the author to correct and palliate its faults effectual. A tragedy is an experiment on the human heart, and an experiment which does not always &s;ucceed, even in the mo&s;t able hands. Zulima, however, is the fir&s;t wo|man pre&s;ented on the &s;tage, who, hurried by pa&s;&s;ion into criminal acts, &s;till pre&s;erved all the genero&s;ity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of love. This character, &s;o natural, &s;o violent, and &s;o tender, might perhaps have de&s;erved indulgence from the audience, and the critics of the theatre, in favour of the new beauties of this part, might have pardoned the weakne&s;s of the 'others, which the author him&s;elf condemned with equal frankne&s;s and &s;everity.</P>
<P>The Di&s;cour&s;es on Man are one of the fine&s;t monuments of French poetry. The plan of them may not be &s;o regular as that of the epi&s;|tles of Pope, but they po&s;&s;e&s;s the advantage of philo&s;ophy more true, mild, and general. All the variety of harmony, a kind of carele&s;s|ne&s;s, &s;oothing &s;en&s;ibility, an enthu&s;ia&s;m ever noble and ever real, impart a charm to them, which alternately delights the mind, the imagi|nation,
<PB N="56" REF="024210_0055_0FC55C27081507E0">
and the heart; a charm, the u&s;e of which was known only to Voltaire, and which was that of plea&s;ing, moving, and in&s;tructing, without ever fatiguing the reader, and of wri|ting to all under&s;tandings and to all ages. Fla&s;hes of true philo&s;ophy frequently break forth, and are generally addre&s;&s;ed &s;o to the feelings or to the fancy as to appear natural, and to become popular. This talent is as be|neficial and as rare as that of giving a pro|found appearance to fal&s;e and trivial ideas is common and dangerous.</P>
<P>Quitting the company of Pope, we admire his genius, and the addre&s;s with which he defends his &s;y&s;tem, but the &s;oul is unmoved, and the mind pre&s;ently finds that its objecti|ons have rather been eluded than an&s;wered. But we cannot leave Voltaire without encou|ragement or con&s;olation; and, while we have a melancholy pro&s;pect of the evils to which na|ture has condemned man, we are likewi&s;e ac|quainted with their antidotes.</P>
<P>The life of Charles XII. was the fir&s;t of the hi&s;torical publications of Voltaire. The &s;tyle, as rapid as the exploits of the hero, hurries on the reader to an uninterrupted train of &s;plen|did expeditions, &s;ingular anecdotes, and ro|mantic events, which give curio&s;ity and feeling no repo&s;e. The narrative is rarely interrupt|ed by reflexions. The author forgot him&s;elf that he might give place to his characters. He &s;eems to relate what he has ju&s;t heard concern|ing his hero. The &s;ingle &s;ubject is battles and

military enterprize; yet, the &s;pirit of a phi|lo&s;opher and the &s;oul of a defender of the hu|man race are pre&s;ent every where.</P>
<P>Voltaire wrote from original memorials, fur|ni&s;hed by tho&s;e who were witne&s;&s;es of the events; and his hi&s;torical truth is warranted by the re&s;pectable te&s;timony of Stani&s;laus, the friend, the companion, and the victim of Charles XII.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory was, notwith&s;tanding, accu&s;ed of being a novel, becau&s;e it had all the inte|re&s;t of one. Though no man, perhaps, ever excited &s;o much enthu&s;ia&s;m, neither was any man ever treated with le&s;s indulgence than Voltaire. As a reputation for wit is in France the thing mo&s;t envied, and as it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for his &s;uperiority in wit to remain unac|knowledged, he was mo&s;t vehemently denied every other merit; and, the pretended claims to wit being as re&s;tle&s;s in every cla&s;s of man|kind as in that of men of letters, the number of tho&s;e who envied him was almo&s;t equal to that of his readers.</P>
<P>In vain had Voltaire imagined that the re|treat of Cirey would hide him from hatred; he had concealed his per&s;on only, his fame &s;till offended his enemies. A libel, which was a malignant attack on his whole life, appeared to the di&s;turbance of his repo&s;e. He was treat|ed like a prince, or a mini&s;ter, becau&s;e he exci|ted equal envy. The Abb&eacute; Desfontaines, who was indebted to Voltaire for liberty and per|haps
<PB N="58" REF="024210_0057_0FC55C323368C828">
for life, was the author of this lible. Ac|cu&s;ed of a &s;hameful vice, which &s;uper&s;tition has cla&s;&s;ed among crimes, he had been impri|&s;oned at a time when, from attrocious and ri|diculous policy, it was thought proper to burn a few men, in order to make another man con|ceive di&s;gu&s;t fur this vice, to which they fal&s;e|ly &s;uppo&s;ed him inclined.</P>
<P>Voltaire, being informed of the misfortune of the Abb&eacute; Desfontaines, who was per&s;onally unknown to him, and who&s;e only recommen|dation was that he was a man of letters, ha|&s;tened to Fontainbleau in &s;earch of Madame de Prie, then all pui&s;&s;ant, from whom he ob|tained the pri&s;oner's liberty, on condition that be &s;hould not appear at Paris. Voltaire fur|ther procured him a place of retirement at the &s;eat of a lady of his acquaintance. Here Desfontaines wrote a libel again&s;t his benefac|tor; this he was obliged to throw into the fire, but he never could pardon Voltaire the act of &s;aving his life. He eagerly took every oppor|tunity the periodical publications afforded, of attacking him; and it was he who, by the mouth of a prie&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&ecirc;tre de &s;&eacute;minaire.</NOTE>, informed the world that Votaire was the author of Le Mondain, an in|genious poem, the intent of which was to &s;how that luxury, by poli&s;hing man's manners and encouraging indu&s;try, obviates a part of tho&s;e ills which take birth in the inequality of, and in&s;en&s;ibility attendant on, riches.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="024210_0058_0FC55C3354FAAAA0">He was thus expo&s;ed to the danger of new bani&s;hment, becau&s;e, to the reproach of hav|ing preached up plea&s;ure, a great one in the eyes of tho&s;e who need the cloak of au&s;terity to conceal vice more real, was added the ad|ditional crime of having ridiculed the amu&s;e|ments of our fir&s;t parents.</P>
<P>In &s;ine, the journali&s;ts publi&s;hed the Vol|tairomanie; and then it was that Voltaire, who &s;o long had &s;ilently &s;uffered under the &s;landers of Desfontaines and Rou&s;&s;eau, aban|doned him&s;elf to emotions of anger, of which his enemies were little worthy.</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfied with avenging him&s;elf by deli|vering up his adver&s;aries to public contempt, and imprinting on them marks which no time can efface, he pro&s;ecuted Desfontaines who e&s;|caped by di&s;avowing the libel, and who im|mediately wrote others to con&s;ole him&s;elf for the misfortune. Thus, at the age of forty-four, after having been patient during twenty years, Voltaire, for the fir&s;t time, forgot that mode|ration which it were highly to be wi&s;hed men of letters never &s;hould forget. Though they have received from nature the formidable gift of devoting their foes to ridicule and &s;hame, they ought to di&s;dain the u&s;e of this dangerous weapon in avenging their own quarrels, and employ it only again&s;t the performers of truth, and the enemies of the rights of man|kind.</P>
<P>The friend&s;hip, which, about the &s;ame time
<PB N="60" REF="024210_0059_0FC55C39C0AC8BE0">
was formed between Voltaire and the prince royal of Pru&s;&s;ia, was one of the fir&s;t cau&s;es of the exce&s;&s;ive anger of his enemies. The young Frederic had received from his father the edu|cation of a &s;oldier only, but nature formed him for a man of an amiable, exten&s;ive, and elevated mind, as well as for a great generall. He was &s;ent to Rhine&s;berg by his father, who, having conceived the project of beheading him as a de&s;erter, becau&s;e he had attempted to tra|vel without permi&s;&s;ion, yielded to the remon|&s;trances of the imperial amba&s;&s;ador, and &s;ati&s;|fied him&s;elf with cau&s;ing the prince to be pre&s;ent at the execution of one of his travel|ing companions.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of retirement, Frederic, who was enamoured with the French language, poetry, and philo&s;ophy, cho&s;e Voltaire for his confident and guide. They mutually &s;ent each other their works; the prince con&s;ulted the philo&s;opher concerning his &s;tudies, and re|que&s;ted le&s;&s;ons and advice. They di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t curious as the mo&s;t difficult metaphy|&s;ical que&s;tions. The prince, at that time, &s;tu|died the works of Wolf, who&s;e &s;y&s;tems and unintelligible language he &s;oon abjured for philo&s;ophy more &s;imple and more true. He al&s;o employed him&s;elf in a refutation of Ma|chiavel: that is, in proving that the mo&s;t certain policy of a &s;overeign is to make moral rules his guide, and that his per&s;onal intere&s;t does not nece&s;&s;arily render him the enemy of

his &s;ubject and his neighbours, as Machiavel had &s;uppo&s;ed, either from a love of hypothe&s;is or to di&s;gu&s;t his countrymen with a monarchi|cal government, toward which they &s;eemed to be inclined by their wearine&s;s of a republican &s;y&s;tem ever tempe&s;tuous and often cruel.</P>
<P>In the preceding century, Tycho-Brahe, Des Cartes, and Leibnitz, had enjoyed the &s;ociety of monarchs, by whom they had been loaded with marks of e&s;teem? but confidence and freedom did not pre&s;ide in this too unequal intercour&s;e&punc; Of the&s;e Frederic gave the fir&s;t example, in which, unfortunately for his fame, he forgot to per&s;i&s;t. He &s;ent his friend, the Baron de Key&s;erling, to vi&s;it the Deities of Cirey, and to bear his protrait and manu&s;cripts to Voltaire. The philo&s;opher was moved, per|haps flattered, by this homage; but his great|e&s;t plea&s;ure was the pro&s;pect of a prince de&s;|tined to reign, who loved literature, and was the friend of philo&s;ophy and the foe of &s;uper|stition. He hoped the author of the Anti-Machiavel would be a pacific monarch, and he took &s;erious delight in &s;ecretly printing the book which he believed mu&s;t bind the prince to virtue from the fear of betraying his own principles, and of reading his condemnation in the work he him&s;elf had written.</P>
<P>When Frederic a&s;cended the throne, he te&s;tified no change, but remained the friend of Voltaire. The cares of government did not enfeeble his love of poetry, nor his avid|ity
<PB N="62" REF="024210_0061_0FC55C3FDB570218">
to po&s;&s;e&s;s the unpubli&s;hed writings of Vol|taire, which were read by &s;carcely any except him&s;elf and Madame du Chatelet. Yet, one of his fir&s;t &s;teps was to &s;u&s;pend the publication of the Anti-Machiavel. Voltaire obeyed, and the corrections which he had made with regret were rendered fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>His de&s;ire that his di&s;ciple, now a king, &s;hould enter into a public engagement, which &s;hould &s;ecure his adherence to philo&s;ophic maxims, was increa&s;ed. He went to meet him at Wezel, and was a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee a young monarch in a uniform, on a camp-bed, &s;hivering with a fever. But his fever did not prevent him from profiting by his neighbour|hood to the principality of Liege, and enforc|ing the payment of a forgotten debt, from the bi&s;hop. Voltaire wrote the memorial, which was &s;upported by the bayonet, and he returned to Paris well &s;atisfied to have found his hero an amiable man. But he refu&s;ed the offers of the king, who wi&s;hed to draw him to Pru&s;&s;ia, and preferred the friend&s;hip of Ma|dame du Chatelet to the favour of a monarch whom he admired.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia declared war again&s;t the daughter of Charles VI. and took advantage of her weakne&s;s to render &s;ome old preten|&s;ions on Sile&s;ia valid. Two battles &s;ecured him the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the province. Cardinal de Fleury, who had undertaken the war in his own de&s;pite, continued his &s;ecret negocia|tions.
<PB N="63" REF="024210_0062_0FC55C470D8D9AC0">
The empre&s;s perceived her intere&s;t was not to treat with France, again&s;t whom &s;he hoped for u&s;eful allies, who would them&s;elves &s;upport the burden of the war; whereas, if &s;he had none but the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch to combat, &s;he mu&s;t be left to her&s;elf, and mu&s;t behold the wi&s;hes and &s;ecret aid of tho&s;e very powers on the &s;ide of her foe.

<P>The war had not interrupted the corre&s;pon|dence between the king and Voltaire&punc; Fre|deric &s;ent poety from the field, while prepar|ing for battle, or amid the tumult of victory; and Voltaire, continuing to prai&s;e his military fame, never cea&s;ed to preach humanity and peace.</P>
<P>The Cardinal de Fleury died. Voltaire had been intimate with him, because he was de&s;i|rous of learning the anecdotes of the reign of Louis XIV; and Fleury, who loved to relate them, dwelt on tho&s;e which regarded him&s;elf, not doubting that Voltaire would eagerly in|&s;ert them in his hi&s;tory.

<P>Voltaire was de&s;igned to be his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the French academy: he had lately acquired new claims which mu&s;t have &s;ilenced envy, had &s;he been capable of a blu&s;h. He had enriched the &s;tage by another ma&s;ter-piece: by Merope, the only tragedy in which tears freely and &s;weetly flow, without the aid of the misfor|tunes of love.

The hou&s;e called on the young duche&s;s of Villars to ki&s;s the au|thor of Merope; and &s;he was under the nece&s;|&s;ity of obeying the imperious will of the public, intoxicated with admiration and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t time that the pit called for the author of a piece; but what was then no more than homage, rendered to genius, degenerated afterward into cu&s;tom, and is now a ridiculous and humiliating ceremony, to which authors, who re&s;pect them&s;elves, re|fu&s;e to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>To this new claim, which even devotion was obliged to re&s;pect, was added the &s;upport of Madame de Ch&acirc;teauroux, then governed by the Duke de Richelieu; an extraordinary man, who at the age of twenty, had twice been in the Ba&s;tile, for the ra&s;hne&s;s of his gallantries; who, by the rumour and the number of his adventures, had made him&s;elf
<PB N="66" REF="024210_0065_0FC55C5048F81CB0">
&s;o fa&s;hionable, among women, as for it to be almo&s;t regarded as an honour to be di&s;honour|ed by him; and who, among his imitators, had formed a kind of gallantry in which love was no longer the inclination to plea&s;ure, but the vanity of &s;eduction. This &s;ame man after|ward contributed to the fame of the victory of Fontenoy, &s;upported the revolution of Genoa, took port Mahon, and obliged an Engli&s;h army to lay down its arms; and when that army had broken the treaty, when it threat|ened his di&s;per&s;ed and feeble quarters, he &s;topped its progre&s;s by his activity and bold|ne&s;s. After which he &s;unk into the intrigues of the court, and lo&s;t, in the maneuvres of a tyrannical and corrupt admini&s;tration, that fame which might have obliterated his early errors.</P>
<P>The Duke de Richelieu had from his infan|cy been the friend of Voltaire; and, though Voltaire had often cau&s;e of complaint again&s;t him, yet he pre&s;erved that remembrance of youthful affection which time cannot eradicate, and a kind of confidence which was rather maintained by habit than by conviction. The duke continued faithful to his old friend, as much as the levity of his character, his caprice, his petty de&s;poti&s;m at the theatres, his con|tempt for every man who was not a courtier, his weakne&s;s toward people in power, and his in&s;en&s;ibility for all that was noble, or u&s;eful, would permit.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="024210_0066_0FC55C51B8920288">At this period he promoted the intere&s;t of Voltaire with Madame de Ch&acirc;teauroux. But M. de Maurepas did not love Voltaire. The Ab|b&eacute; de Chaulieu had written an epigram again&s;t Oedipus, becau&s;e he was offended to &s;ee a young man, who had become his rival in &s;ugi|tive poetry, into which philo&s;ophy and volup|tuou&s;ne&s;s were infu&s;ed, acquire the additional fame of &s;ucceeding at the theatre; and M. de Maurepas, who&s;e vanity was to be the man of mo&s;t wit at table, could not pardon Voltaire for &s;o evidently robbing him of this advantage, with which it was not too ridiculous, at that time, for a mini&s;ter of &s;tate to be flattered.</P>
<P>Voltaire attempted to di&s;arm his anger by an epi&s;tle, in which he be&s;towed &s;uch prai&s;e as might appear mo&s;t natural to the mind and cha|racter of M. de Maurepas. This epi&s;tle, which contained as much in&s;truction as eulogium, ef|fected no change in the &s;entiments of the mi|ni&s;ter; who, that he might prevent Voltaire from gaining a place in the academy, combi|ned with the prie&s;t Boyer, whom Fleury had preferred, as the tutor of the dauphin, to Ma&s;|&s;illon, who&s;e talents and virtue he &s;cared; and which Boyer he, on his death-bead, recom|mended to the king to the charge of be&s;towing eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, apparently from the hope that his memory might be regretted by the Jan&s;eni&s;ts, M. de Maurepas was likewi&s;e glad to have an opportunity of &s;ecretly coun|teracting Madame de Ch&acirc;teauroux, with who&s;e

But this trifling act of inju&s;tice, from a man &s;o celebrated, had not prevented him from &s;oli|citing and obtaining leave, from the pre&s;ent king, that the poet, who had been &s;o great an honour to his age and nation, might return to Paris, at the clo&s;e of his life, there to enjoy the fruits of his fame.</P><P>This is the note of the general corre&s;pondent of the literary typographical &s;ociety.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>He knew how ea&s;y this would be to a mini|&s;ter; and that, under a feeble government, the influence of a mi&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t yield to that of intriguing fanatic prie&s;ts, who were more de&s;|picable than a pro&s;titute, in the eyes of rea&s;on, tho' more re&s;pected by the populace.

the alliance of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia was to France. But this monarch feared to en|gage anew with a power who&s;e timid and wa|vering policy could not in&s;pire confidence. Voltaire, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, might induce him to change his opinion, and was &s;ecretly charg|ed with this negociation. It was agreed that the per&s;ecution of Boyer &s;hould be the pretext of his journey into Pru&s;&s;ia. He thus obtained the liberty to ridicule the poor prie&s;t, who went to complain to the king that Voltaire made him appear a fool in foreign courts. The king an&s;wered&mdash;"It was a &s;ettled point."</P>
<P>Voltaire departed, and Piron, at the head of his enemies, wrote abundance of epigrams and &s;ongs on his pretended di&s;grace. Piron was in the habit of in&s;ulting all celebrated men who underwent per&s;ecution. His works abound with proofs of this mean malice; yet he had the character of a good natured man, becau&s;e he was indolent; and, not having any native dignity of mind, he did not offend the vanity of others.</P>
<P>After having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who con&s;tantly refu&s;ed all ne|gociation with France, Voltaire had the addre&s;s to divine the true motive of his refu&s;al. It was the weakne&s;s that France had per&s;i&s;ted in not to declare war again&s;t the Engli&s;h, and by this conduct to appear to entreat for peace, when &s;he had a right to dictate its conditions.</P>
<P>He returned to Paris and gave an account
<PB N="70" REF="024210_0069_0FC55C63C6AB7948">
of his journey. The following &s;pring the King of Pru&s;&s;ia again declared war again&s;t the Queen of Hungary, by which u&s;eful diver&s;ion he obli|ged her troops to evacuate Al&s;atia. This im|portant &s;ervice, with that of having penetrated, as he pa&s;&s;ed through the Hague, into the views of the Dutch who apparently were in a &s;tate of uncertainty, did not procure Voltaire any of tho&s;e marks of re&s;pect from which he wi&s;hed to rai&s;e a rampart again&s;t his literary enemies.</P>
<P>The Marquis D'Argen&s;on was called to the mini&s;try. He was a man who de&s;erves to be ranked among tho&s;e few people in power who have really loved philo&s;ophy, and the public good. His ta&s;te for literature had connected him with Voltaire, whom he more than once employed to write manife&s;tos, declarations, and di&s;patches, the &s;tyle of which was required to be correct, dignified, and well adapted.</P>
<P>Such was the manife&s;to which was to have been publi&s;hed by the Pretender, on his de&s;cent into Scotland with a &s;in all French army, which the Duke de Richelieu was to have command|ed. Voltaire had then an opportunity of la|bouring in conjunction with Count Lally, a zealous Jacobite, and the determined enemy of the Engli&s;h; who&s;e memory Voltaire after|wards defended with &s;o much fortitude when an unju&s;t &s;entence, executed with barbarity, &s;a|crificed him to the re&s;entment of &s;ome of the &s;ervants of the Ea&s;t India Company.</P>
<P>But he had, at the &s;ame time, a &s;upport
<PB N="71" REF="024210_0070_0FC55C6536927968">
more potent in the Marchione&s;s de Pompadour, with whom he had been intimate while her name was d'Etiole. She committed the wri|ting of a piece to him, for the fir&s;t marriage of the Dauphin. The place of gentleman of the chamber, the title of hi&s;toriographer of France, and in fine the protection of the court, which was nece&s;&s;ary to oppo&s;e the faction of devotees who excluded him the French academy, were the recompen&s;e he received. It was on this occa&s;ion that he wrote the following ver&s;es:
<Q><L>Mon Henri quatre et ma Za&iuml;re,</L>
<L>Et mon Am&eacute;ricaine Alzire,</L>
<L>Ne m'ont valu jamais un &s;eul regard du Roi;</L>
<L>J'eus beaucoup d'ennemis, avee tr&egrave;s-peu de gloire;</L>
<L>Les honneurs et les biens pleuvent enfin &s;ur moi,</L>
<L>Pour une farce de la foire.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Henriade, Za&iuml;re, and my American Alzire, never obtained me a look from maje&s;ty: I had many enemies and little fame; but honours at length are &s;howered on me, for having written a farce.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>This was pa&s;&s;ing rather too &s;evere a judg|ment on the Prince&s;s of Navarre, which is a work full of noble and affecting gallantry.</P>
<P>The favour of the court however was in&s;uffi|cient to open the doors of the academy. He was obliged, in order to di&s;arm the devotees, to write a letter to Father la Tour, in which he made prote&s;tation of his re&s;pect for religion, and, which was more nece&s;&s;ary, of his attach|ment to the Je&s;uits. In de&s;pight of the ad|dre&s;s with which he manages his language in
<PB N="72" REF="024210_0071_0FC55C66E21D0840">
that letter, it were better he had renounced the academy than have had the weakne&s;s to write it. This weakne&s;s would have been inexcu&s;a|ble had it been the &s;acrifice of vanity, in order to obtain a title which had long been incapa|ble of adding honour to the name of Voltaire. But he &s;uppo&s;ed it his &s;hield; he imagined he &s;hould find &s;upport again&s;t per&s;ecution from the academy. He pre&s;umed too favourably of the fortitude and ju&s;tice of his a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>In his di&s;cour&s;e to the academy, he fir&s;t threw off the yoke of cu&s;tom, by which the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es &s;eemed rather condemned to be a &s;tring of compliments than of true prai&s;e. Vol|taire boldly &s;poke of literature and of ta&s;te, and his example is in &s;ome manner become a law, again&s;t which the academicians, who are man of letters, rarely venture to err. But he did not go &s;o far as to &s;uppre&s;s their reiterated prai&s;e of Richelieu, S&eacute;guier, and Louis XIV. which has hitherto been done only by two or three of the bolde&s;t academicians. He men|tioned Cr&eacute;billon, in his di&s;cour&s;es, with the no|ble genero&s;ity of a man who fears not to ho|nour the talents of a rival, or to afford arms to his own antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>A new torrent of libels was poured upon him, which he had not the fortitude to de&s;pi&s;e. The police was, at that time, committed to a man who had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome months in the coun|try with Madame de Pompadour. A wretched mu&s;ician, of the opera band, was arre&s;ted,
<PB N="73" REF="024210_0072_0FC55C779C2594E8">
wno&s;e name was Travenol, and who, with the advocate Rigoley de Juvigny, privately &s;old the&s;e libels. The father of Travenol, an old man of eighty, went to Voltaire, and demand|ed pardon for his guilty &s;on; and the anger of the poet was hu&s;hed by the fir&s;t cry of hu|manity. He wept with, embraced, and con|&s;oled the old man; and ha&s;tened away with him, to obtain the liberty of his &s;on.</P>
<P>Voltaire was not long in favour. Madame de Pompadour cau&s;ed tho&s;e honours to be con|ferred on Cr&eacute;billon, which he had been refu|&s;ed. Voltaire had con&s;tantly done ju&s;tice to the author of Rhadami&s;tus, but he could not be &s;o humble as to &s;uppo&s;e him &s;uperior to the author of Alzire, Mahomet, and Merope. In &s;uch exaggerated enthu&s;ia&s;m for Cr&eacute;billon, he di&s;covered nothing but a &s;ecret de&s;ire that he him&s;elf &s;hould be humbled: nor was he de|ceived.</P>
<P>The wit and the poet might have pre&s;erved powerful friends; but the&s;e titles in Voltaire concealed a philo&s;opher, a man more earne&s;t for the progre&s;s of rea&s;on, the acquirement of per&s;onal fame.</P>
<P>His character, naturally proud and indepen|dent, yielded to ingenuous adulation; he was prodigal of prai&s;e, but he pre&s;erved his feel|ings and his opinions, and the freedom of di&s;|covering them. Strong or affecting le&s;&s;ons ro&s;e out of panegyric: that manner of prai&s;ing, which might &s;ucceed at the court of
<PB N="74" REF="024210_0073_0FC55C7A360DA968">
Frederic, could not but offend at any other court.</P>
<P>He therefore returned to Cirey, and &s;oon afterwards to the court of Stani&s;laus. This prince, twice elected king of Poland, once by the will of Charles XII. and once by the de|&s;ire of the nation, never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more than the title of &s;overeign. Having retired into Lorraine with this title, he there repaired, by his beneficent acts, the ills which the French admin&s;tration had committed: the paternal government of Leopold corrected an age of deva&s;tation and misfortune. His devotion had neither deprived him of the love of plea&s;ure nor of an affection for men of wit. His hou&s;e was that of a wealthy private per&s;on: his man|ners tho&s;e of native candour; of a man who had never been unhappy, except becau&s;e others had determined to make him a king; nor ever dazzled by a title, from which he had derived nothing but danger. He wi&s;hed to &s;ee Ma|dame du Chatelet and Voltaire at his court, or rather living as his inmates. The author of the Sea&s;ons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Lambert.</NOTE>, the only French poet, who, like Voltaire, has united philo&s;ophy and wit, then lived at Luneville, where he was only known as an amiable young officer; but his fir&s;t poe|tical productions, full of rea&s;on, wit, and ta&s;te, even then be&s;poke a man born to be an honour to his age.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="024210_0074_0FC55C7BC7075100">At Luneville, where Voltaire lived a life of occupation and mild tranquillity, he had the misfortune to lo&s;e his friend. Madame du Charelet died, at the moment when &s;he had fini&s;hed her tran&s;lation of Newton; the labour of which had &s;hortened her days. King Sta|ni&s;laus went to con&s;ole and weep with Voltaire in his chamber.</P>
<P>Having returned to Paris, the poet betook him&s;elf to his labours, a means of di&s;&s;ipating grief, which nature has imparted but to few. Such a power over our thoughts, and &s;uch force of mind, which affliction cannot vanqui&s;h, are precious gifts, which mu&s;t not be depreciated by confounding them with want of feeling. Sen&s;ibility is not weakne&s;s; it is a capability of grief, without being overwhelmed by it: the &s;oul is not the le&s;s affectionate, nor has &s;orrow been le&s;s &s;incere, becau&s;e oppo&s;ed with fortitude; or becau&s;e conquered by extraor|dinary powers.</P>
<P>Voltaire was weary of hearing the fa&s;hiona|ble world, and mo&s;t men of letters, prefer Cr&eacute;billon to him&s;elf; which they did le&s;s from opinion than to puni&s;h him for the univer&s;ality of his talents. Men are ever more indulgent to circum&s;cribed genius, which exerted on one object appears to be a kind of in&s;tinct, becau&s;e it offends not &s;o many &s;pecies of &s;elf-love, and humbles their pride le&s;s.</P>
<P>This opinion of the &s;uperiority of Cr&eacute;billon was maintained with &s;o much pa&s;&s;ion, that, in
<PB N="76" REF="024210_0075_0FC55C7D352BD4E8">
the preliminary di&s;cour&s;e to the Encyclopedia, M. D'Alembert had need of fortitude to grant equality to the author of Alzire and Merope, and dur&s;t not extend ju&s;tice further. Voltaire at length determined to avenge him&s;elf, and oblige the public to give him his true rank, by writing Semiramis, Ore&s;tes, and Rome Pre|&s;erved; which three &s;ubjects had before been treated by Cr&eacute;billon. Every cabal that had been formed again&s;t Voltaire had united, to obtain momentary &s;ucce&s;s for the Cataline of his rival; a piece, the conduct of which is ab|&s;urd and the &s;tyle barbarous; in which Cicero propo&s;es that his daughter &s;hould &s;educe Cata|line, and a high prie&s;t appoints a rendezvous for the lovers in a temple, where he introduces a courtezan in men's clothes, and afterward treats the &s;enate as impious, becau&s;e it there di&s;cu&s;&s;ed on &s;tate affairs.</P>
<P>On the contrary, Rome Pre&s;erved is the ma|&s;ter-piece of &s;tyle and of rea&s;on, in which Ci|cero appears with all his dignity and eloquence; in which Ce&s;ar &s;peaks and acts like a man born to reduce Rome to &s;ubjection, to overwhelm his opponents by his glory, and obtain pardon for tyranny by the force of his talents and vir|tues; and in which Cataline is a villain, but one who endeavours to excu&s;e his vices from example, and his crimes from nece&s;&s;ity. Re|publican energy and Roman feelings entirely po&s;&s;e&s;s the poet.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="024210_0076_0FC55C84BAB99990">Voltaire had a &s;mall theatre on which he acted his pieces, and where he often played the part of Cicero. Never, it is &s;aid, was illu&s;i|on more complete: while he recited he ap|peared to create his character; and when, in the fifth act, Cicero again appeared before the &s;enate, when he excu&s;ed his love of fame by reciting the following beautiful lines.

the character and the poet were one, and the auditor imagined he heard Cicero, or Voltaire, avow and excu&s;e this weakne&s;s of great minds.</P>
<P>There is only one good part in the Electra of Cr&eacute;billon, and this is a &s;ubaltern character. Ore&s;tes, who knows not that he is Ore&s;tes, is in love with the daughter Aegy&s;thus, who has the misfortune to be called Iphiana&s;&s;a. The implacable Electra is enamoured with the &s;on of Aegy&s;thus, and the&s;e in&s;ipid amours occupy the &s;cene, while the furies are leading a be|wildered &s;on to the commi&s;&s;ion of parricide; being condemned by the gods to take this hor|rible revenge.</P>
<P>Voltaire felt that Clytemne&s;tra &s;hould be rendered intere&s;ting by her remor&s;e, by being
<PB N="78" REF="024210_0077_0FC55C928F44BCB8">
characteri&s;ed as rather feeble than guilty, and overawed by the cruel Aegy&s;thus, but a &s;ham|ed of having loved him, and &s;en&s;ible of the weight of her chains and of her crimes. If we compare this with the other tragedies of Vol|taire, we &s;hall, no doubt, find it much inferi|or to his be&s;t works; but if we contra&s;t it with Sophocles, whom he meant to follow, that he might teach the French the character and tra|gic conceptions of that poet, we &s;hall perceive he had the art to pre&s;erve his beauties, imi|tate his &s;tyle, correct his defects, and render Clytemne&s;tra more pathetic, and Electra le&s;s barbarous. For which rea&s;on, when, in de&s;|pite of cabal, the permanent beauties of the Greek poet were tran&s;mitted to the French &s;tage, by a man worthy of becoming the in|terpreter of the mo&s;t eloquent of the ancient tragic writers, and there enforce applau&s;e, Voltaire, more ardent in the intere&s;t of good ta&s;te than in behalf of his own fame, could not forbear calling from the pit, in a momentary effu&s;ion of rapture, "Go on Athenians, it is Sophocles."</P>
<P>The Semiramis of Cr&eacute;billon was no &s;ooner produced than forgotten, That of Voltaire is the &s;ame &s;ubject which, fifteen years before, he had treated under the name of Eryphile, and which he withdrew from the &s;tage, though the piece was highly applauded. During its repre&s;entations, he more perfectly felt all the difficulties of the fable. He perceived that,
<PB N="79" REF="024210_0078_0FC55C93C6AAB5F8">
to render a woman who had de&s;troyed her hu&s;|band, that &s;he might reign her&s;elf, intere&s;ting, it was nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;plendour of her reign, her conque&s;ts, her virtues, and the extent of her empire &s;hould force re&s;pect, and &s;eize on the mind of the &s;pectators; that the criminal queen &s;hould be the mi&s;tre&s;s of the world, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the virtues of a great monarch. He felt that, while exhibiting the prodigies of a foreign religion on the &s;tage, it would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, by magnificence and an elevated and religious &s;tyle, not to &s;uffer the imagination to cool, to make the gods interfere on all oc|ca&s;ions, and to conceal the ab&s;urdity of a mi|racle by ince&s;&s;antly pre&s;enting the con&s;olatory idea of a Divine Power, exerci&s;ing a &s;low but inevitable vengeance on the &s;ecret crimes of kings.</P>
<P>Love, offen&s;ive in Ore&s;tes, was nece&s;&s;ary in Semiramis. Ninyas mu&s;t have a mi&s;tre&s;s, that he might feel a tenderne&s;s for Semiramis, be &s;en&s;ible of her kindne&s;s, and that &s;he might facinate him by her charms before he knew her to be his mother; otherwi&s;e the horror which ince&s;t in&s;pires would have been injurious to that character which was to intere&s;t the au|dience. The &s;tyle of Semiramis, the maje&s;ty of the &s;ubject, the pomp of the exhibition, and the peculiar pathos of &s;ome of the &s;cenes, were triumphant over envy and faction. But it was long before equal ju&s;tice, was rendered to Ore&s;tes, and Rome Pre&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="024210_0079_0FC55C95722A58A0">Complete ju&s;tice, perhaps, has not yet been done; nor can we be &s;urpri&s;ed at this, when we recollect that all colleges and all the hou&s;es in which the teachers of youth are them&s;elves educated are devoted to fanatici&s;m, and that children in general are educated in prejudices again&s;t Voltaire.</P>

<P>The prie&s;ts, who forgot not the Letters on the Engli&s;h Nation and Mahomet, while they were waiting occa&s;ion to per&s;ecute him, en|deavoured to decry him and his works, and employed their whole a&s;cendancy over youth again&s;t him, e&s;pecially that which, as &s;p&iacute;ritu|al directors, they pre&s;erved over private fami|lies and the devotees of the court. Ab&s;olute &s;ilence only could pre&s;erve him from calumny.

<P>It is &s;aid that Voltaire, approaching Louis XV. after the repre&s;entation of the Temple of Fame, in which Trajan after his victories accords peace to the world, and receives the crown which had been refu&s;ed to conquerors and re&s;erved for the man who was the friend of humanity, thus addre&s;&s;ed the monarch&mdash; Trajan e&s;t-il content<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Is Trajan &s;atisfied?</NOTE>? and that the king was le&s;s flattered by the compari&s;on than offended by the familiarity.</P>
<P>M. d'Argen&s;on refu&s;ed to &s;upport Voltaire as a candidate for the title of Free A&s;&s;ociate of the Academy of Sciences, and for obtaining a &s;eat in the Academy of Belles Lettres, of which place he was at that time ambitious, as a refuge again&s;t the army of periodical critics who were obliged by the police to treat liter|ary bodies with re&s;pect, except when other bodies or powerful individuals thought it their

intere&s;t to humble them by abandoning them to the attacks of the&s;e contemptible ene|mies.</P>
<P>Voltaire, therefore, went to Berlin, and the very monarch, who had di&s;dained him, and the court, in which he had been treated with di&s;re&s;pect, were offended at his departure. The lo&s;s of a man who honoured France, and the di&s;grace of having obliged him to &s;eek an a&s;y|lum in another country, were then only re|membered. In the palace of the king of Pru&s;|&s;ia, he found peace and even the &s;emblance of freedom; feeling at fir&s;t no kind of &s;ubjection, except that of pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome hours with the king to correct his works, and to teach him the art of writing. He u&s;ually &s;upped with his maje&s;|ty; and the&s;e &s;uppers, at which there was free|dom in exce&s;s, where every que&s;tion of meta|phy&s;ics and morals was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed without re|&s;traint, where the mo&s;t unbounded plea&s;antry enlivened, or cut &s;erious argument &s;hort, and where the king generally di&s;appeared to give place to the man of wit, were moments of agreeable relaxation to Voltaire. The remain|der of his time was con&s;ecrated to &s;tudy.</P>
<P>Here he improved &s;ome of his tragedies, fi|ni&s;hed his Age of Louis the XIVth, corrected his poem of the Maid of Orleans, wrote part of his E&s;&s;ay on the Manners and Spirit of Nati|ons, and compo&s;ed a poem on Natural Law; while Frederic governed his &s;tates without a mini&s;ter, in&s;pected and improved his army, com|po&s;ed
<PB N="84" REF="024210_0083_0FC55CA5BA5643E0">
poetry and mu&s;ic, and wrote philo&s;ophy and hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The royal family encouraged Voltaire in his pur&s;uits; he addre&s;&s;ed ver&s;es to the prince&s;&s;es, acted tragedy with the brothers and &s;i&s;ters of the king, and while he taught then to declaim, led them to feel the beauties of French poetry: for poetry ought to be &s;poken aloud; nor can it be under&s;tood, in a foreign tongue, by tho&s;e who are not in the habit of hearing it recited by &s;peakers, who can give it that accent and force which are its characteri&s;tics.</P>
<P>This Voltaire called the palace of Alcina; but the enchantment was of too &s;hort duration. The men of literature, who had been longer at Berlin than him&s;elf, were jealous of prefer|ence which was too con&s;picuous, e&s;pecially of that kind of independence which he pre&s;erved, that familiarity which the charms and brillian|cy of his wit gave him, and that art of ming|ling truth with panegyric and of imparting to flattery the tone of jocular ea&s;e.</P>
<P>La M&eacute;trie told Voltaire that the king, to whom he was one day mentioning tho&s;e marks of kindne&s;s he di&s;covered for his chamberlain, replied, "I want him at pre&s;ent to revi&s;e my works; but having &s;ucked the orange, we throw away the rind." When Voltaire heard this, the encantation was over; and his mind felt that kind of &s;u&s;picion which never &s;uffered him to lo&s;e &s;ight of his project for e&s;caping.</P>
<P>In the mean time the king was informed
<PB N="85" REF="024210_0084_0FC55CA9917B7E90">
that Voltaire, being pre&s;&s;ed by general Man|&s;tein to revi&s;e his memoirs, had an&s;wered, "The king has &s;ent me his dirty linen to wa&s;h, yours mu&s;t wait;" and that, another time, he had &s;aid, in a fit of ill humour, pointing to &s;ome poetical papers of the king, lying on the table, "That man is Ce&s;ar and the Abb&eacute; Cottin."</P>
<P>Mutual inclination, however, acted on the monarch and the philo&s;opher. Frederic &s;aid, long after their &s;eparation, that he had never met with &s;o amiable a man as Voltaire; and Voltaire, notwith&s;tanding his re&s;entment, which never was entirely effaced, confe&s;&s;ed, that when Frederic thought proper, he was the mo&s;t plea&s;ing of mankind. They likewi&s;e united in their open contempt for prejudice and &s;uper|&s;tition; the plea&s;ure they look in making them the eternal objects of their je&s;ts, their common love for that philo&s;ophy which is cheerful and inviting, and their mutual di&s;po&s;ition to &s;earch and to &s;eize on the ridiculous in whatever pre|tended to &s;uperior gravity, wire the &s;ame. Hence it &s;hould have &s;eemed that the &s;torm mu&s;t have ended in a calm, and that intere&s;t and plea&s;ure mu&s;t have continued them in friend|&s;hip: but the jealou&s;y of Maupertuis rendered them irreconcilable.</P>
<P>Maupertuis, a man of much wit, but not of too much learning, and of &s;till le&s;s philo&s;ophy, was tormented by that de&s;ire of fame which makes us choo&s;e trifling means when the great are wanting, utter paradoxes when we are
<PB N="86" REF="024210_0085_0FC55CB3FB810840">
unable to di&s;cover truths, generali&s;e formula when we cannot invent them, and accumulate incongruities when we are deficient in new ideas. In Paris, he had been &s;een to leave the company, or hide him&s;elf behind a &s;creen, when he could not continue the principal &s;peak|er; and in like manner at Berlin, whether at the academy of &s;ciences or the table of the king, he would be the fir&s;t. He was indebted to Voltaire for a great part of his reputation, as well as for the honour of being perpetual pre&s;ident of the academy of Berlin, and of ex|erci&s;ing authority there in his maje&s;ty's name.</P>
<P>Some je&s;ts which Voltaire had indulged in, when Maupertuis, following the king to the army, was taken pri&s;oner at the battle of Mol|witz, had angered him, and he vented his com|plaints with ill humour. Voltaire returned a friendly an&s;wer, and appea&s;ed him by writing four lines for his portrait. Maupertuis, &s;ome years afterward, took it much ami&s;s that Vol|taire had not mentioned him in his di&s;cour&s;e, when elected to the French academy; and the arrival of Voltaire at Berlin compleated his di&s;gu&s;t. He &s;aw him the friend of the &s;ove|reign, in who&s;e pre&s;ence he him&s;elf was but a courtier; and beheld him giving le&s;&s;ons to the man from whom he received orders.</P>
<P>Surrounded by enemies, and diffident of the continuance of royal friend&s;hip, Voltaire &s;e|cretly regretted, and endeavoured to recover, his lo&s;t independence. He thought proper to
<PB N="87" REF="024210_0086_0FC55CB5848ACFB0">
employ a Jew to transfer a part of his proper|ty out of Pru&s;&s;ia. The Jew betrayed his tru&s;t; and, to revenge him&s;elf on Voltaire, who, hav|ing detected him, would not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be robbed, he brought an ab&s;urd action, know|ing that hatred is not difficult in admitting evi|dence. The king, to puni&s;h his friend for hav|ing attempted to pre&s;erve his liberty and property, pretended to believe him guilty, to deliver him up to ju&s;tice, and even to exclude him his pre&s;ence till the cau&s;e &s;hould be de|termined.</P>
<P>Voltaire addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Maupertuis, who had not yet openly te&s;tified his &s;entiments, and reque&s;ted his interference with the chief judge. Maupertuis returned a haughty refu|&s;al, and Voltaire perceived he had another ene|my. This ridiculous &s;uit, at length, ended as it &s;hould do; the Jew was condemned, and par|doned by Voltaire. The king then admitted Voltaire once more, and added new marks of re&s;pect to former kindne&s;s, by be&s;towing on him a hou&s;e near Pot&s;dam.</P>
<P>The eyes of hatred, however, are always open and watchful of opportunity. La Beau|melle, a prote&s;tant, and native of Languedoc, fir&s;t an apprentice to a go&s;pel mini&s;ter at Ge|neva, and afterwards acting the French wit in Denmark, being &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from Copen|hagen, came to &s;eek his fortune at Berlin; having no other title to fame than that of hav|ing lately publi&s;hed a libel. He went to Vol|taire,
<PB N="88" REF="024210_0087_0FC55CB91DB8EAD0">
and pre&s;ented the book to him, in which Voltaire him&s;elf was ill treated, and in which the men of wit, who had been invited into Pru&s;|&s;ia, among whom he was come to &s;olicit a place, was compared to apes or tho&s;e dwarfs who had formerly been maintained at certain courts. Such a ridiculous over&s;ight was the momentary object of plea&s;antry at the king's &s;upper; but the je&s;ts were reported to La Beaumelle by Maupertuis, who, charging them all to the account of Voltaire, made La Beau|melle his irreconcilable foe, and &s;ecured to him&s;elf a tool, who aided his malice by &s;hame|ful libels, without bringing the character of the pre&s;ident of the academy in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Maupertuis wanted a&s;&s;i&s;tance; he had late|ly advanced the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible action, as a new mechanical principle, which was much contro|verted, though the illu&s;trious Euler did it the honour of defending it, and at the &s;ame time in&s;tructed its author in its full extent and true u&s;e. Ko&euml;nig not only oppo&s;ed it, but a&s;&s;ert|ed it was not new, and quoted the fragment of a letter from Leibnitz, in which it was con|tained. Maupertuis, having learnt from Ko&euml;nig him&s;elf that he had only a copy of the letter from Leibnitz, thought proper formally to &s;ummons him before the academy of Berlin, to produce the original. Ko&euml;nig an&s;wered that he obtained his copy from the unfortunate Hienzi, who had long &s;ince been beheaded, for having attempted to deliver the people of the
<PB N="89" REF="024210_0088_0FC55CC3CF791AF8">
Canton of Bern from the tyranny of the &s;enate. The original was not to be found among the remaining papers of Hienzi, and the academy, from motives partly of fear and partly of mean|ne&s;s, declared Ko&euml;nig unworthy of the title of academician, and &s;truck him from their li&s;t. Maupertuis &s;eemed not to have known that the general voice of the learned only could be|&s;tow, or take from him, the honour of making a di&s;covery, that this opinion mu&s;t be free and voluntary, and that any formal act, by render|ing it &s;u&s;picious, would but dimini&s;h its autho|rity.</P>
<P>Voltaire had been acquainted with Ko&euml;nig at Cirey, where he came to give le&s;&s;ons in the doctrines of Leibnitz to Madame du Chatelet. He had pre&s;erved a degree of friend&s;hip for him, though he had &s;ometimes indulged him|&s;elf in je&s;ts to his di&s;advantage, during his re|&s;idence in France. He did not love Mauper|tuis, and hated per&s;ecution, whatever form it might a&s;&s;ume to torment mankind; he there|fore openly took the the part of Ko&euml;nig, and publi&s;hed &s;ome writings, in which rea&s;on and ju&s;tice were &s;ea&s;oned by delicate and poignant wit. Maupertuis engaged the vanity of the king in behalf of the honour of his academy, and prevailed on him to exact a promi&s;e from Voltaire to ridicule neither it nor its pre&s;ident. The promi&s;e was given, but unfortunately the king, who had commanded &s;ilence, imagined he him&s;elf might &s;peak. He wrote &s;eve|ral humourous pieces, which, but with &s;ome
<PB N="90" REF="024210_0089_0FC55CC5426A9B48">
little inequality, were partly again&s;t Mauper|tuis, and partly again&s;t Voltaire. The lat|ter imagined that the king, by this con|duct, had relea&s;ed him from his promi&s;e, and that the privilege of being the only one who &s;hould laugh was not included in the royal pre|rogative. He, therefore, profited by a gene|ral permi&s;&s;ion which he had formerly obtained, and &s;ent his Akakia to the pre&s;s, in which Mau|pertuis was devoted to eternal ridicule.</P>
<P>The king laughed. He had little affection, and le&s;s e&s;teem for Maupertuis; yet, jealous of his own authority, he cau&s;ed this piece of humour to be burnt by the hangman. This is a mode of vengeance which it is rather &s;ingular that a philo&s;ophic king &s;hould borrow from the inqui&s;ition.</P>

depart. The king, who wi&s;hed to humble but not to lo&s;e him, &s;ent him &s;ome bark, but no permi&s;&s;ion. He again wrote that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary he &s;hould go and drink the waters of Plombiers; he was an&s;wered, tho&s;e of Sile&s;ia were equally &s;alutary.</P>
<P>Voltaire, at length, thought proper to a&s;k to &s;ee his maje&s;ty, flattering him&s;elf that by his pre&s;ence he could awaken &s;entiments which were rather wounded than extinct.</P>
<P>The baubles that he had formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were returned to him. He ha&s;tened to Pot&s;|dam, &s;aw the king, and a few moments produ|ced a total change. Familiarity revived, for|mer cheerfulne&s;s was recovered even at the expence of Maupertuis, and Voltaire obtained permi&s;&s;ion to go to Plombiers, on giving his promi&s;e to return. This promi&s;e was not, per|haps, very &s;incere, but it was le&s;s obligatory than one given between equals; the hundred and fifty thou&s;and men, who guarded the Pru&s;|&s;ian frontiers would not &s;uffer it to be con&s;i|dered as given with entire freedom.</P>
<P>Voltaire ha&s;tened to Leip&s;ic, where he made &s;ome &s;tay, to recover his &s;trength, which had been exhau&s;ted by this long per&s;ecution. Mau|pertuis &s;ent him a ridiculous challenge, the on|ly effect of which was, that it opened a new &s;ource to his inexhau&s;tible plea&s;antry. From Leip&s;ic he went to vi&s;it the Duche&s;s of Saxe-Gotha, a prince&s;s, who cultivated letters, loved philo&s;ophy, and was &s;uperior to prejudice. At
<PB N="92" REF="024210_0091_0FC55CCBF56F69B0">
her reque&s;t he there began his Annals of the Empire.</P>
<P>From Gotha, he departed for Plombiers; and took the road to Frankfort. Maupertuis was determined on revenge; his challenge had been un&s;ucce&s;sful, and the libels of La Beaumelle he thought in&s;ufficient. This his contemptible &s;econd had been obliged to quit Berlin, after a ridiculous adventure and &s;ome weeks impri&s;onment. He had fled to Gotha with a chamber-maid, who had robbed the mi&s;|tre&s;s &s;he had left; his libels had driven him from Frankfort; and he had &s;carcely arrived at Paris before he was thrown into the Ba&s;tile. The pre&s;ident of the academy at Berlin had therefore to &s;eek another avenger. He em|bittered the ill humour of the king. The &s;low|ne&s;s with which Voltaire travel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, his &s;tay at Gotha, and a con&s;iderable annuity for the lives of him&s;elf and his niece Madame Dennis pur|cha&s;ed of the Duke of Wirtemberg, all &s;poke his determination of never returning to Pru&s;&s;ia, and he had taken with him a copy of the po|etical works of the king, which were then on|ly known to the wits of the court.</P>
<P>A fear was excited in Frederic's mind that a &s;pecies of vengeance, terrible even to a roy|al poet, would be taken. It was po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t, that Voltaire should imagine he had a right to reclaim the ver&s;es he had given, and to &s;pecify tho&s;e he had corrected. The king gave a knave, whom he kept in his pay at F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nk|fort

to purcha&s;e or kidnap men for him, an order to arre&s;t Voltaire, and not to relea&s;e him till he &s;hould have yielded up his cro&s;s, his key, and the grant of his pen&s;ion, together with the poems which Freitag called "the work of Poe&s;hys of the king my ma&s;ter." The&s;e volumes had unfor|tunately been left at Leip&s;ic, and Voltaire was kept in clo&s;e confinement for three weeks. Ma|dame Dennis his niece, who had come to meet him, was treated with like rigour. Guards were placed at the door, and &s;oldier continued in each of their chambers who never &s;uffered them to leave his &s;ight, &s;uch fears were enter|tained le&s;t the work of Poe&s;hys &s;hould e&s;cape. This precious pledge was at length re&s;tored to Freitag, and Voltaire was relea&s;ed; but not however till he had been obliged to be&s;tow mo|ney on certain adventurers who took that op|portunity to commence litigious &s;uits: having e&s;caped from Frankfort he went to Colmar.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, a&s;hamed of his ridicu|lous anger, di&s;avowed the proceedings of Frei|tag, but he had &s;o much morality as not to pun|i&s;h him for having obeyed. It is &s;trange that a city, calling it&s;elf free, &s;hould &s;uffer a foreign power to commit &s;uch vexations within its walls; but freedom and independence are to the fee|ble mere words.

<P>The only work he publi&s;hed at Berlin was the age of Louis XIV. which is the &s;ole hi&s;to|ry of that reign, which can be read. On the authority of the the old courtiers of Louis XIV. or of tho&s;e who had lived in intimacy with them, he there relates a &s;mall number of anec|dotes &s;elected with di&s;cernment, and &s;uch as &s;erve to paint the &s;pirit and character of the per&s;ons of the age. Political and military events are given in a rapid, intere&s;ting man|ner; the picture abounds with bold &s;trokes. In &s;ome chapters, he recounts the attempts which Louis XIV. made for the improvement of the laws and finances, and for the encouragement of trade and indu&s;try; and we ought to par|don Voltaire for having, on this occa&s;ion, fol|lowed the opinions of the mo&s;t enlighted men of his own times, in&s;tead of that knowledge which did not then exi&s;t.</P>
<P>His chapters on Calvini&s;m, Jan&s;eni&s;m, Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et|i&s;m, and the di&s;pute on the Chine&s;e ceremonies, are models of the manner in which a prudent friend of truth ought to treat the&s;e maladies &s;o di&s;graceful to man, when the number or the power of the di&s;ea&s;ed is &s;uch as to make it ne|ce&s;&s;ary gently to rai&s;e the veil which conceals their deformity. We have only to reproach him with too much &s;everity again&s;t the Calvin|i&s;ts, who&s;e enormities proceeded from &s;elf-defence, and who&s;e crimes were but a kind of
<PB N="95" REF="024210_0094_0FC55CD678105738">
repri&s;al of juridical murders committed on them in certain provinces.</P>
<P>The di&s;coveries made in the &s;ciences, and the progre&s;s of the arts, Voltaire related with clear|ne&s;s, preci&s;ion, and impartiality; and his de|ci&s;ions continually appeared dictated by a free and &s;ound mind, and a mild indulgent philo|&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The catalogue of the writers of the age of Louis XIV. was an original thought. It had never before entered the imagination, thus, by a trait or a few lines, to paint men of litera|ture, philo&s;ophers and poets, without dryne&s;s or affectation, with ta&s;te &s;eldom mi&s;taken, and accuracy ever poignant.</P>
<P>The work brought foreign nations aquainted with Louis XIV. among whom he had been disfi|gured by a multitude of libels, and taught them to re&s;pect a people whom they had previou&s;ly viewed through the fal&s;e medium of prejudice, jealou&s;y, and hatred. The countrymen of Vol|taire were le&s;s indulgent. Such as were &s;laves from condition or character were highly offend|ed that a Frenchman &s;hould dare to di&s;cover follies in Louis XIV. Prejudiced people were angry at the freedom with which he treated the mi&s;takes of generals, and the defects of great writers; and others, who in &s;ome re|&s;pects were more ju&s;t, reproached him with too much indulgence or enthu&s;ia&s;m. But hi&s;|tory is never impartially judged in the country to which it relates, the deci&s;ions of who&s;e in|habitants

<P>Voltaire pa&s;&s;ed near two years in Al&s;atia, during which he publi&s;hed his Annals of the Empire, the only chronologic abridgment which can be read without wearine&s;s, becau&s;e it is written in a rapid &s;tyle and abounds with philo&s;ophic deductions, expre&s;&s;ed with energy. Thus Voltaire has given a model of that kind of writing, the merit and utility of which his friend&s;hip for the Pre&s;ident H&eacute;nault induced him to exaggerate.</P>
<P>He thought, at fir&s;t, of &s;ettling in Al&s;atia; but, unfortunately, the Je&s;uits attempted to convert him, and, not &s;ucceeding, began to di&s;&s;eminate calumniating rumours which be|&s;poke per&s;ecution. Voltaire endeavoured to ob|tain not permi&s;&s;ion to return to Paris, for this he had never been forbidden, but an a&s;&s;urance that he &s;hould not be di&s;agreeable to the court. He knew Fance too well not to be &s;en&s;ible that, odious as he was by his love of truth to all powerful bodies, he mu&s;t &s;oon become the ob|ject of their per&s;ecution, would the court &s;uf|fer him to be oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer was not to his &s;atisfaction. Vol|taire found him&s;elf unprotected in his own country, though his name &s;upported its ho|nour, at that time degraded throughout Eu|rope by ridiculous quarrels concerning Billets of Confe&s;&s;ion; and at the very moment when, by his publication of the Age of Louis XV.

he had erected a monument to its glory. He determined to go and drink the waters of Aix, in Savoy. Pa&s;&s;ing through Lyons, Car|dinal de Tencin, famous for the conver&s;ion of La&s;s and the council of Embrun, informed him he could not invite him to dinner, becau&s;e Voltaire was out of favour at court. But the inhabitants of that opulent city, in which the &s;pirit of trade has not effaced the love of let|ters, recompen&s;ed him for the politic incivility of their archbi&s;hop. He there received tho&s;e honours which public enthu&s;ia&s;m pays to genius. His pieces were played before him, amid the loud acclamations of a people, inebriated with the joy&punc; of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the man to whom they were indebted for &s;uch dignified plea&s;ures. But he dur&s;t not fix his abode at Lyons; the conduct of the Cardinal informed him he was not far enough from his enemies.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing through Geneva, to con&s;ult with Tronchin, the beauty of the country, the equality which appeared to prevail there, the advantage of being out of France, and in a city where French was the language of the people, the freedom of thought which was greater than in a monarchical or catholic coun|try, and the liberty of the pre&s;s, founded in|deed le&s;s on the laws than on the intere&s;ts of trade, all determined him to fix his retreat in that place.</P>
<P>But he &s;oon perceived that a city in which the pedantic and au&s;tere &s;pirit of Calvin had

taken deep root, where the vanity of imitat|ing ancient republics, and the jealou&s;y of the poor again&s;t the rich had e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;umptuary laws, where theatrical exhibitions offended both Calvini&s;tic fanatici&s;m, and republican rigour, would to him neither be a &s;afe nor an agreeable re&s;idence. He determined to pro|cure a place of refuge in the territories of Geneva again&s;t Catholic per&s;ecution, and a retreat in France again&s;t puritanical gloom, and accordingly to live alternately at Tourney, &s;ince called Ferney, in France, and the Delices at the gates of Geneva.</P>
<P>Here he fixed his abode with Madame Den|nis his niece; who, being a widow without children, was free to indulge her friend&s;hip for her uncle, and to acknowledge the kind|ne&s;s with which he had rendered her circum|&s;tances ea&s;y. She took on her&s;elf the charge of his dome&s;tic affairs; and, to increa&s;e his tranquillity, by relieving him from &s;uch fa|tiguing trifles. This was the only aid he re|ceived; labour was to him an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of enjoyment; and freedom was all he wanted to render his moments happy.</P>
<P>Hitherto, we have written the tempe&s;tuous life of a philo&s;ophic poet, who&s;e lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e for truth, and who&s;e independence of character had oc|ca&s;ioned him more enemies than friends, who gave no reply to their malice except by epi|grams which were either witty or dreadfully &s;evere, and who&s;e conduct had more frequent|ly

<P>In his pre&s;ent retirement, removed from illu&s;ion and whatever could excite momentary or per&s;onal pa&s;&s;ion, we &s;hall &s;ee him yield en|tirely to his prevailing and ince&s;&s;ant love of fame, to the &s;till more potent nece&s;&s;ity his mind felt of being productive, and to his zeal for the de&s;truction of prejudice, which was indeed the mo&s;t powerful and active of all the &s;en&s;a|tions he felt. This peaceful life, &s;eldom di&s;|turbed, and then by the threats of per&s;ecution, rather than per&s;ecution it&s;elf, we &s;hall &s;ee adorned not only, like his youth, by the exer|ci&s;e of private benevolence, a quality common to all men who&s;e hearts have hot been harden|ed and minds corrupted by misfortune or van|ity, but by tho&s;e acts of enlightened and bold benevolence, which, while they relieve the &s;ufferings of certain individuals, are of &s;ervice to the whole human race.</P>
<P>And hence it was that, indignant to behold a corrupt mini&s;ter pur&s;ue the unfortunate Byng to dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h that he might conceal his own errors and flatter the pride of the Engli&s;h populace, Voltaire, in order to re&s;cue this innocent vic|tim from the Machiavelian arts of Pitt, em|ployed every means which genius and compa&s;|&s;ion could in&s;pire, and &s;ingly rai&s;ed his voice again&s;t inju&s;tice; while a&s;toni&s;hed Europe in &s;ilence &s;aw &s;uch an example of atrocity wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

of the mo&s;t barbarous times, which England dared to give in this age of humanity and knowledge.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t work he &s;ent from his retreat was the Orphan of China, a tragedy written dur|ing his re&s;idence in Al&s;atia, at a time when he hoped he might have been allowed to live at Paris, and was de&s;irous of theatrical &s;ucce&s;s to &s;ecure his friends and impo&s;e &s;ilence on his foes.</P>
<P>In the commencement of the tragic art, poets were certain of a&s;toni&s;hing the mind by giving to the characters &s;entiments contrary to nature, and by &s;acrificing the true feelings of the heart to the more uncommon love of fame, exaggerated patrioti&s;m, and devoted|ne&s;s to princes.</P>

Leontine nece&s;&s;arily in&s;pires admiration; and the haughtine&s;s of his character induces an au|dience, who idolize their king, to pardon him the &s;acrifice of his &s;on. But when means like the&s;e, of producing effects by a departure from nature, begin to be exhau&s;ted, and when art improves, the poet is then obliged to write more conformably to rea&s;on, and &s;eek re|&s;ources in nature her&s;elf. Yet, &s;uch is the force of habit, the &s;acrifice of Zamti, founded indeed on more dignified and powerful motives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">an that of Leontine, expiated by tears and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;educed the &s;pectators.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="024210_0100_0FC56A5BCA940200">A&s;toni&s;hment only was excited at the fir&s;t repre&s;entation of the Orphan, by the follow|ing truly philo&s;ophic lines:
<Q><L>La Nature et l'Hymen, voil&agrave; les lois premi&egrave;res,</L>
<L>Les devoirs, les liens des nations enti&egrave;res;</L>
<L>Ces lois viennent des dieux, le re&s;te e&s;t des humains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Nature and Hymen fir&s;t gave laws to earth;</L><L>Their origin divine, the re&s;t is human all.</L></Q></NOTE>.</L></Q>
The audience he&s;itated, and the voice of na|ture needed the aid of reflexion in order to be heard. Thus can a great poet &s;ometimes decide the mind between ancient errors and truths, which to vanqui&s;h wavering yet &s;till oppo&s;ing prejudice, is obliged &s;o wait for new &s;upport. Men often dare not confe&s;s to them|&s;elves that &s;low progre&s;s which rea&s;on makes in their minds; but they are ready to follow her when, appearing in a &s;trong and effective manner, they are obliged to acknowledge her pre&s;ence. Thus, the&s;e &s;ame ver&s;es have &s;ince been continually heard with tran&s;port, and Voltaire enjoyed the plea&s;ure of having aven|ged nature.</P>
<P>This play is the triumph of virtue over power, and of the laws over arms. Till then, Mahomet excepted, no poet had &s;ucce&s;sfully made one of the&s;e men, who&s;e fame appears awful, and who&s;e characters pre&s;ent the picture of extraordinary &s;trength of &s;oul, in love without degradation.

<P>The repo&s;e of Voltaire was &s;oon di&s;turbed by the publication of the Maid of Orleans. This poem, in which licentiou&s;ne&s;s and philo|&s;ophy are combined, and truth a&s;&s;umes the ma&s;k of &s;atiric and voluptuous humour, was begun about the year 1730, but had never been fini&s;hed. The author had intru&s;ted what he had written of it only to a few of his friends, and to &s;ome princes. The rumour of its ex|i&s;tence had brought down menace on him; and, by not fini&s;hing it, he took the &s;ure&s;t means to avoid the dangerous temptation of making it public. Copies unfortunately got abroad, one of which fell into inimical and &s;elfi&s;h hands, and the work appeared not only with &s;uch defects as the author had left; but with lines added by the editors full of gro&s;&s;|ne&s;s and ill ta&s;te, and with &s;atiric traits which might endanger the &s;afety of Voltaire. The de&s;ire of gain, the plea&s;ure of attributing their own wretched ver&s;es to a great poet, and the more malignant plea&s;ure of expo&s;ing him to per&s;ecution, were the motives of this act of infidelity, the honour of which was divided between la Beaumelle and the Ex Capuchin Maubert.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="024210_0102_0FC56A6166C39198">They &s;ucceeded only &s;o far as to trouble that repo&s;e for a moment which they wi&s;hed to de&s;troy. His friends evaded the per&s;ecution, by proving the work to be &s;purious, and the hatred of the editors &s;erved him whom it meant to wound.</P>
<P>This, however, obliged Voltaire to fini&s;h the poem, and pre&s;ent a work to the world, at which the author of Mahomet and the age of Louis XIV. need not blu&s;h. The work ex|cited lively feelings of enthu&s;ia&s;m in a numer|ous cla&s;s of readers, while the foes of Voltaire affected to decry it as unworthy of a philo&s;opher, and almo&s;t as a blemi&s;h on the writings and the life of a poet.</P>

<P>Voltaire him&s;elf, when &s;peaking of la Font|aine, has well remarked that works, in which voluptuou&s;ne&s;s and humour are mingled, amu&s;e without heating or &s;educing the imagination. And if &s;uch works be &s;ources of plea&s;ure to the fancy, which lighten the unea&s;y moments of life, dimini&s;h the misfortunes of privation, un|bend a mind fatigued by labour, and fill up mo|ments in which the weary and &s;unken &s;oul can neither act nor meditate with effect, wherefore rob men of an aid which nature pre&s;ents? What will be the effect of &s;uch reading? No other than that of di&s;po&s;ing men to more mildne&s;s and indulgence. It was not &s;uch books that G&eacute;rard or Clement read; or that the &s;couts of Cromwell carried in the pommels of their &s;addles.</P>
<P>Two works very different in them&s;elves ap|peared at the &s;ame epoch: the poem on Natur|al Law, and the poem of the De&s;truction of Li&s;bon. To di&s;play morals, the principles of which rea&s;on teaches all men which are &s;ancti|oned by their hearts, and which remor&s;e in|forms them it is their duty to practice; to &s;how that the&s;e are the principles which God, the common father of men, alone could impart, &s;ince they alone are uniform; to prove that the
<PB N="105" REF="024210_0104_0FC56A6570904BF8">
duty of individuals is mutually to pardon their mi&s;takes, and that of &s;overeigns to prevent the pernicious tendency of tho&s;e vain opinions which fanatici&s;m and hypocri&s;y &s;upport, by wi&s;ely treating them all with indifference; &s;uch is the purport of the poem on Natural Law.</P>
<P>This work, the fine&s;t which man ever con&s;e|crated to the Deity, excited the anger of the devotees, who called it the poem of Natural Religion; though Religion is only mentioned in order to oppo&s;e intolerance, and though there is no &s;uch a thing as natural religion. It was burnt by the parliament of Paris, which began to be terrified as well at the progre&s;s of rea&s;on as at that of Molini&s;m. Under the con|duct, at this period, of men who were either blinded by pride or fal&s;e policy, it imagined it would be more ea&s;y to impede the advance|ment of knowledge than to merit the applau&s;e of the enlightened. It felt not the want it&s;elf had of the good opinion of the public; it mi&s;con&s;trued tho&s;e who were to be its guides, and declared it&s;elf the enemy of men of letters, at that preci&s;e moment when the &s;uffrage of the&s;e men in France, and even over all Europe, began to acquire influence.</P>
<P>However the poem of Voltaire, which has &s;ince been commented on in various celebrated books, is &s;till that in which the connexion be|tween morality and the being of a God is mo&s;t clearly demon&s;trated. Thirty years later and the
<PB N="106" REF="024210_0105_0FC56A68861F3708">
book which was burnt as impious, would al|mo&s;t have appeared a work of religion.</P>
<P>In the poem on the De&s;truction of Li&s;bon, Voltaire indulged tho&s;e &s;entiments of terror and melancholy which this dreadful accident in&s;pired. He led the tranquil &s;ect of Optimi&s;ts a|mid the&s;e fearful ruins, combated their cold and puerile doctrine with the indignation of a phi|lo&s;opher deeply &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ufferings of mankind, expo&s;ed the difficulties on the origin of evil in their full force, and avowed it is im|po&s;&s;ible for them to be &s;olved by man.</P>
<P>This poem, in which at the age of more than &s;ixty the mind of Voltaire, warmed by a love of humanity, di&s;plays all the &s;trength and fire of youth, was not the only work in which he op|po&s;ed Optimi&s;m. He publi&s;hed Candide, the fir&s;t of philo&s;ophic romances; which &s;pecies of writing he brought from England, and added to its perfection. It is a kind of compo&s;ition which appears ea&s;y of execution, but it re|quires an uncommon talent; that of expre&s;&s;ing by a je&s;t, a flight of the fancy, or by the in|cidents of the romance, the re&s;ult of profound philo&s;ophy, without cea&s;ing to be natural, plea&s;ing, and accurate. Hence it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;elect &s;uch effects as need neither develope|ment nor proof, and at once to avoid com|mon place unworthy of repetition, and ab|&s;traction which is too deep or too new, and which is not adapted to the multitude: that is, it is nece&s;&s;ary to be, without appearing to be, a philo&s;opher.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="024210_0106_0FC56A6B7707A968">We may add, few books of philo&s;ophy are more u&s;eful. Such romances are read by frivo|lous men, whom the very name of philo&s;opher di&s;gu&s;ts or renders gloomy, and who, however, it is requi&s;ite &s;hould be freed from prejudice, and made the opponents of the herd who are intere&s;ted in its defence. The human race would be condemned to eternal error if, to free them from it, it were nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tudy and under|&s;tand the proofs of truth. Fortunately the native intelligence of the mind is &s;ufficient for the comprehending of tho&s;e &s;imple truths which are the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential. It is therefore &s;ufficient to di&s;cover &s;ome means of fixing the attention of the indolent, and of engraving the&s;e truths in their memory; and this is the great u&s;e of philo&s;ophic romances, and the merit of tho&s;e in which Voltaire has alike &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed his imitators and his models.</P>
<P>Candide was &s;oon followed by a free tran&s;la|tion of the book of Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, and a part of the &s;ong of Solomon.</P>
<P>Madame de Pompadour had been per&s;uaded that it would be profoundly politic for her to a&s;&s;ume the ma&s;k of devotion, by which &s;he might &s;hield her&s;elf from the &s;cruples and in|con&s;tancy of the king, and at the &s;ame time calm the hatred of the people. She wi&s;hed to make Voltaire an actor in this farce. The duke de la Valiere propo&s;ed to him to tran&s;late the P&s;alms, the book of Proverbs, Solomon's &s;ong, and the Eccle&s;ia&s;tes. The edition was to have
<PB N="108" REF="024210_0107_0FC56A71D3113DA8">
been printed at the Louvre, and the author to have returned to Paris under the protection of the religious favorite. But Voltaire could not act the hypocrite, not even to be made a cardinal, &s;ome hopes of which were given him about this time. Such propo&s;als generally come too late; and were they made in time, the policy of them would not be very certain. He who mu&s;t be a dangerous enemy might become a &s;till more dangerous ally. Let us &s;uppo&s;e Calvin or Lu|ther called to the purple, when they might have accepted the dignity without di&s;grace, and let us imagine what would have been the con&s;equence. The baubles of vanity do not &s;atiate &s;ouls impelled by the ambition of reign|ing over the minds of men; they do but &s;up|ply new arms.</P>
<P>Voltaire, however, was tempted to make e&s;&s;ays in tran&s;lation; not to recover his religi|ous repute, but to exerci&s;e him&s;elf in another &s;pecies of compo&s;ition. When they appeared, the devout imagined he only had intended to parody that which he had tran&s;lated, and ex|claimed it was &s;hameful. They did not imagine that Voltaire had &s;oftened and purified the text; that his Eccle&s;ia&s;tes had le&s;s of the doc|trine of materiali&s;m than the original; and that his &s;ong of &s;ongs was le&s;s indecent than the &s;a|cred text. The&s;e works were therefore once more burnt, for which Voltaire avenged him|&s;elf by a &s;atiric and humuorous letter, in which he mocked at the hypocri&s;y of morals, the pe|culiar
<PB N="109" REF="024210_0108_0FC56A757708F188">
vice of the modern nations of Europe, which has contributed more than is imagined to de&s;troy that energy of character by which the ancients were di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>In 1757, the fir&s;t edition of his works, act|ually made under his own in&s;pection, was print|ed. He revi&s;ed it with rigorous attention, &s;e|lected &s;ome of his numerous fugitive pieces with &s;everity, but with judgment, and added his immortal E&s;&s;ay on the Manners and Spirit of Nations.</P>
<P>Voltaire had long complained that among the moderns e&s;pecially, the hi&s;tory of a country was that of its kings, or its chiefs; that it &s;poke only of wars, treaties, and civil commotions; and that the hi&s;tory of morals, arts, &s;ciences, legi&s;lation, and political government, had been almo&s;t forgotten. Tho&s;e very ancients in who&s;e writings we find mo&s;t of morals, and internal politics, have only in general added, to the hi&s;tory of wars, that of popular factions. We imagine, while we read &s;uch hi&s;torians, that the human race was created only to exhi|bit the political or military talents of a few in|dividuals; and that the object of &s;ociety is not the happine&s;s of the &s;pecies, but the plea&s;ure of having revolutions to read, or to relate.</P>
<P>Voltaire formed the plan of a hi&s;tory which &s;hould contain all that was mo&s;t important for men to know: &s;uch as the effects produced on the peace and happine&s;s of nations, their pre|judices, knowledge, virtues, and vices, and the cu&s;toms and the arts of different ages.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="024210_0109_0FC56A76DC744958">He cho&s;e the period from Charlemagne to the pre&s;ent century; but, not confining him&s;elf &s;olely to European nations, he intere&s;ted and in|&s;tructed the reader by an abridged retro&s;pect of the &s;tate of the other parts of the globe; the revolutions they had undergone, and the opinions by which they had been governed.</P>
<P>It was to reconcile Madame du Chatelet to the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory, that he had undertaken this immen&s;e labour, which obliged him to read books of erudition, &s;uch as would have been &s;uppo&s;ed incompatible with the liveline&s;s of his fancy, and the activity of his mind. The &s;up|po&s;ition that he &s;hould &s;erve the human race &s;upported him, and erudition was not dull to a man who, having the &s;agacity to detect and amu&s;e him&s;elf with the ridiculous, found an in|exhau&s;tible &s;ource of this in the &s;peculative or practical doctrines of our ance&s;tors; and in the follies of tho&s;e who have tran&s;mitted or com|mented on them, while admiring them either with &s;incerity or hypocri&s;y equally laughable.</P>
<P>Such a work could plea&s;e none but philo&s;o|phers. It was accu&s;ed of being frivolous, be|cau&s;e it was clear, and read without labour; and of being inaccurate, becau&s;e there are &s;ome errors of names and dates di&s;coverable in it, which in them&s;elves are things ab&s;olutely indif|ferent. Yet it has been proved, by the very reproaches of his bittere&s;t critics, that, in a hi|&s;tory &s;o exten&s;ive, no writer was ever more ex|act.

He was often taxed with partiality, be|cau&s;e he exclaimed again&s;t tho&s;e prejudices which pu&s;illanimity or meanne&s;s had too long re&s;pected; and it is ea&s;y to &s;how that, far from exaggerating the crimes of &s;acerdotal de&s;po|ti&s;m, he has rather dimini&s;hed their number, and &s;oftened their atrocity.

to men of rea&s;on, a work delightful by the choice of its materials, by the rapidity of its &s;tyle, by that love of truth and humanity which is con&s;picuous in every page, and by the art of pre&s;enting contra&s;ted pictures, and unexpected &s;imilarities, without cea&s;ing to be ea&s;y and na|tural; as well as by deducing, in language ever &s;imple, grand con&s;equences, and making profound reflexions The author has not given the hi&s;tory of ages, but that which we wi&s;h to remember of hi&s;tory; that which the mind de|lights to recollect.</P>
<P>Few books would be more u&s;eful, in a ra|tional plan of education. While we read the the facts, we here are taught the art of judg|ing them truly, of exerci&s;ing the native inde|pendence of the mind, without which man is but the &s;ervile in&s;trument of prejudice, and of contemning &s;uper&s;tition, fearing fanatici&s;m, de|te&s;ting intolerance, and hating tyranny, with|out cea&s;ing to love peace, and that mildne&s;s of manners which is as nece&s;&s;ary to the happi|ne&s;s of mankind as is the wi&s;dom of legi&s;lation it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Hitherto, in private or public education, which alike are guided by prejudice, youth have &s;tudied hi&s;tory as disfigured by vile or &s;u|per&s;titious compilers; and though, &s;ince the publication of the e&s;&s;ay of Voltaire, two men, the Abb&eacute; de Condillac and the Abb&eacute; Millot, have merited not to be numbered in this cla&s;s, yet, re&s;trained by their &s;ituation, they have

left the reader too much to divine: in order to under&s;tand them, we ought not to have any need of their in&s;truction.</P>
<P>This work placed Voltaire in the cla&s;s of original hi&s;torians; and he has the honour of having effected a revolution in the manner of writing hi&s;tory, by which England indeed has hitherto only profited. Hume, Robert&s;on, Gibbon, and Wat&s;on, may, in &s;ome re&s;pects, be con&s;idered as his &s;cholars. The hi&s;tory of Voltaire has another advantage: which is, that it may be taught in England as well as in Ru&s;|&s;ia, and in Virginia as con&s;i&s;tently as at Bern or Venice. He has in&s;erted none but &s;uch truths as every &s;pecies of government may adopt. He only requires that human rea&s;on &s;hould have the right of improving it&s;elf; that the citizen &s;hould enjoy his natural freedom; and that the laws &s;hould be mild and the religion tole|rant. He addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to all mankind, and &s;ays nothing which nay not enlighten them all, without offence to any of tho&s;e opinions which are &s;o connected with the con&s;titution and in|dividual intere&s;t of a country as not to yield to rea&s;on, till &s;uch, time as the de&s;truction of more general error &s;hall have rendered the ap|proach of truth le&s;s difficult.</P>
<P>In this edition, Voltaire had prefixed to his f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gitive pieces of poetry an epi&s;tle addre&s;&s;ed to his hou&s;e of the Delices; or, rather, it was an ode to liberty, and &s;ufficed to an&s;wer tho&s;e who, in the height of their ari&s;tocratic zeal,
<PB N="114" REF="024210_0113_0FC56A7F17008CC0">
had accu&s;ed him of being the enemy of liberty. In the&s;e pieces, in which refined gaiety, deli|cate feeling, and gallantry &s;ucce&s;&s;ively appear, Voltaire &s;ought not to be a poet; yet every &s;pecies of poetic beauty flowed from his pen when he thought not of them; he did not en|deavour to di&s;play philo&s;ophy, yet throughout the whole is to be found whatever is &s;uited to the &s;ubject, to the &s;ituation, and the charac|ters. In &s;uch poetic effu&s;ions, as in romances, the philo&s;ophy of the work &s;hould appear le&s;s exten&s;ive than the philo&s;ophy of the author. It is with the&s;e writings as with elementary books which cannot be well written if the author's knowledge does not embrace more than that which they contain; and therefore, although the&s;e works are regarded as frivolous, tho&s;e of them which &s;tand in the fir&s;t rank are pro|duced only by men of &s;uperior minds.</P>
<P>This &s;ame year was the epoch of a reconci|liation between Voltaire and his royal di&s;ciple; the Au&s;trians, already in the heart of Sile&s;ia, were on the point of completing the conque&s;t of it; a French army was on the frontiers of Brandenbourgh: the Ru&s;&s;ians, ma&s;ters of Pru&s;|&s;ia, threatened to overrun Pomerania and the Marches. The Pru&s;&s;ian monarchy &s;eemed to be annihilated; and the prince, who had been the author of its &s;plendour, appeared to have no other re&s;ource than to inter him&s;elf beneath its ruins, and to pre&s;erve his glory by peri&s;h|ing in the moment of a victory.</P>

The Margra|ve&s;s had recour&s;e to Voltaire, who addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Cardinal de Ten&ccedil;in, knowing that this mini&s;ter, forgotten &s;ince the death of Fleury who employed while he de&s;pi&s;ed him, had pre&s;erved a private corre&s;pondence with the king. Ten&ccedil;in wrote; but the only an&s;wer he receieved was the order of the mini&s;ter for foreign affairs to reject the negociation by a letter, of which they had even &s;ent him a co|py. The aged politician, who would not for|merly invite Voltaire to his table in deference to the court, could not bani&s;h his chagrin when he found that he had offended the court by his complai&s;ance to Voltaire; and it &s;hortened his

days. In his youth, more perilous adventures had only &s;erved to animate his talent for in|trigue, becau&s;e then hope &s;u&s;tained him, and he was among the number of men who find in power and rank a con&s;olation for &s;hame; but, in this affair, he beheld the la&s;t thread de&s;troy|ed which connected him with royal power.</P>
<P>Voltaire commenced another negociation, through the medium of the Marechal de Riche|lieu, but it was equally fruitle&s;s. A third, &s;ome years later, was &s;o far &s;ucce&s;sful as to obtain the con&s;ent of M. de Choi&s;eul to receive a &s;ecret envoy from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia.

<P>During this period, &s;o dangerous and &s;o glo|rious to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, Voltaire appear|ed at one time to rea&s;&s;ume his former influence over the monarch, at another to pre&s;erve no|thing but the remembrance of the affair of Frankfort; and it was then that he wrote tho&s;e remarkable memoirs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have added them as an appendix to this life.</NOTE> in which neither good humour nor ju&s;tice are lo&s;t in the lively recol|lection

<P>The Margrave&s;s of Bareith died in the mid&s;t of the war. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia wrote to Voltaire, and reque&s;ted him to confer an im|mortality on the name of his &s;i&s;ter, of which her mild and amiable virtues, her &s;oul equally &s;uperior to prejudices, to grandeur, and mi&s;|fortune, had rendered her worthy. The ode, which Voltaire con&s;ecrated to her memory, breathes a &s;oft &s;en&s;ibility, and a &s;imple in|tere&s;ting philo&s;ophy. This &s;pecies of compo|&s;ition is one of tho&s;e in which he was the lea&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, becau&s;e it requires a degree of per|fection which he could never re&s;olve to aim at in trifling works, and becau&s;e his rea&s;on could not yield at plea&s;ure to that enthu&s;ia&s;m which is &s;aid to be the characteri&s;tic of the ode. The odes of Voltaire are only fugitive pieces, in which we find the great and philo&s;ophic poet, but in which we perceive him embara&s;&s;ed and con&s;trained by a form which ill agreed with the fire of his genius.

<P>Voltaire, having retired to Ferney, gave a &s;mall number of literary articles to the Ency|clopedia; he prepared &s;ome of tho&s;e on philo|&s;ophic &s;ubjects, but with le&s;s zeal, becau&s;e he felt that the editors had le&s;s need of his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance there, and becau&s;e that, in general, though his great works in ver&s;e had been form|ed to con&s;titute his glory, he had &s;carcely ever written in pro&s;e but with views of univer&s;al utility.

<P>Happily, the honour of having given the Encyclopedia to Europe, compen&s;ated France for the &s;hame of having oppo&s;ed its progre&s;s. It was, with ju&s;tice, regarded as the work of the nation, and its per&s;ecution as that of a policy and jealou&s;y equally de&s;picable.</P>
<P>But the conte&s;ts which the Encyclopedia had occa&s;ioned did not cea&s;e with the pro&s;cription of that work. Its principal authors and their friends, marked by the name of philo&s;ophers and Encyclopedi&s;ts, which was de&s;igned as an opprobrium by the enemies of rea&s;on, were compelled to unite even by this very per&s;ecu|tion, and Voltaire naturally became their lead|er by his age, his celebrity, his zeal, and his

genius. He had long before enjoyed &s;ome friends and a great number of admirers; at that period, he had a party. The per&s;ecution rallied, under his &s;tandard all the men of merit, whom, perhaps, his &s;uperiority would have kept at a di&s;tance from him, as it had bani&s;h|ed their predece&s;&s;ors; and enthu&s;ia&s;m took the place of former inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It was in the year 1760 that this literary war was mo&s;t violent. Le Franc de Pompig|nan, an e&s;timable man of letters but an indif|ferent poet, of who&s;e works there remain a fine &s;tanza, and a feeble tragedy in which the combined genius of Virgil and Meta&s;ta&s;io could not yield him &s;ufficient &s;upport, was elected one of the French academy. Cloathed with the honours of magi&s;tracy, he thought that his dignity, as well as his works, exempted him from all gratitude; in the di&s;cour&s;e, which he delivered at his admi&s;&s;ion, he permitted him&s;elf to in&s;ult the men who&s;e names did the greate&s;t honour to the &s;ociety that conde&s;cended to receive him; and, clearly pointing out Vol|taire accu&s;ed him of infidelity and fal&s;ehood. Soon after, Pali&s;&s;ot, the venal in&s;trument of the rancour of a woman, exhibited the philo|&s;ophers on the &s;tage. The laws, which pro|hibit the ridiculing individuals at the theatre, were &s;ilent. The magi&s;trates betrayed their duty, and &s;aw, with a malignant joy, men, who&s;e knowledge and influence on public opin|ion they dreaded, immolated in the &s;cene,
<PB N="122" REF="024210_0121_0FC56A996B0D9F28">
without recollecting that while they opened the way to &s;atire they expo&s;ed them&s;elves to its &s;hafts. Cr&eacute;billon di&s;graced his old age, by approving the piece. The Duke de Choi|&s;eul, then the favourite mini&s;ter, countenanc|ed this indignity, through a weak complai&s;ance to the &s;ame woman, of who&s;e re&s;entment Pa|li&s;&s;ot was the in&s;trument. The journals re|peated the in&s;ults of the theatre. Still Voltaire combated all. The Poor Devil, the Ru&s;&s;ian at Paris, Vanity, a croud of humourous pieces in pro&s;e &s;ucceeded each other with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity.</P>
<P>Le Franc de Pompignan complained to the king, and to the academy, and beheld, with an impotent grief, that his own name was ob|&s;cured by the &s;plendour of that of Voltaire. Each &s;tep he took did but increa&s;e the &s;atire, which every tongue repeated, and the ver&s;es in which he is con&s;igned to eternal ridicule. He made a formal propo&s;al to an augu&s;t patron, to break a promi&s;e which he had made to this patron him&s;elf, by returning to the academy, to vote for a man. in who&s;e behalf the prince was intere&s;ted. He received, in return for this &s;acrifice, a polite refu&s;al, and had the mortification to hear his patron him&s;elf repeat, as he withdrew, the lines &s;o terrible to him:
<Q>Et I' ami Pompignan pen&s;e &ecirc;tre quelque cho&s;e!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What, does friend Pompignan think him&s;elf &s;omebody!</NOTE>:</Q>
<PB N="123" REF="024210_0122_0FC56A9B3580CAE8">
and he retired to bury his humbled pride and deceived ambition in the country: a fearful, but &s;alutary, example of the power of genius and the dangers of literary hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>Fr&eacute;ron, an ex-je&s;uit as well as Desfontains, had &s;ucceeded the latter in the trade of flat|tering, by periodical &s;atires, the jealou&s;y of the enemies of virtue, of rea&s;on, and of ta|lents. He di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the war again&s;t the philo&s;ophers. Voltaire, who had long &s;upported his outrages, at length did ju|&s;tice, and avenged his friends. In the comedy of l' Eco&s;&s;ai&s;e (the Scotch-woman) he intro|duced a depraved journali&s;t, who&s;e character was formed of venality and rancour. The pit, in the character, recognized Fr&eacute;ron, who, delivered over to public di&s;dain in a piece which could not fail to be pre&s;erved to the theatre by intere&s;ting &s;cenes, and the original and forcible character of the worthy blunt Freeport, was condemned to bear, during the remainder of his life, a ridiculous and di&s;|graced name. Fr&eacute;ron, in applauding the in|&s;ult offered to the philo&s;ophers, had forfeited his right of complaining; and his protectors cho&s;e rather to abandon him than to avow a partiality which might have involved their own di&s;credit.</P>
<P>Other enemies, le&s;s virulent, had been either corrected or puni&s;hed; and Voltaire, triumph|ing in the mid&s;t of the&s;e victims &s;acrificed to rea&s;on and to his glory, &s;ent to the theatre,

at the age of &s;ixty-&s;ix, the chef-d'oeuvre of Tancred. That tragedy was dedicated to the Marchione&s;s de Pompadour. It was the fruit of the addre&s;s with which Voltaire could, with|out wounding the Duke de Choi&s;eul, &s;upport the cau&s;e of the philo&s;ophers, who&s;e adver&s;a|ries had obtained a flight protection from that mini&s;ter. This dedication taught his enemies that their calumnies were not more injurious to his &s;ecurity than their critici&s;ms to his fame: it completed his vengeance.</P>
<P>In this &s;ame year he learned that a young niece of Corneille langui&s;hed in a condition unworthy of his name; "It is the duty of a &s;oldier" he cried, "to &s;uccour the niece of his general." Mademoi&s;elle Corneille was invited to Ferney; and &s;he there received an education &s;uitable to the rank that her birth had marked for her in &s;ociety. Voltaire even carried his delicacy &s;o far as not to &s;uffer the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Mademoi&s;elle Corneille to ap|pear as his benefaction. He wi&s;hed that &s;he &s;hould owe that to the works of her uncle, and he undertook to publi&s;h an edition of them with notes. The creator of the French Theatre commented on by the writer who had con|ducted that theatre to it's perfection, a man of genius, born at a time when ta&s;te was not yet formed, judged by a rival who joined to ge|nius the gift, almo&s;t as rare, of a ta&s;te that was penetrating without &s;everity, delicate without timidity, and enlightened by a long

and happy experience of the art, the&s;e are the beauties pre&s;ented in that work. Voltaire &s;peaks in it of Corneille's defects with frank|ne&s;s, of his beauties with enthu&s;ia&s;m. Never has Corneille been examined with &s;uch rigour, never has he been prai&s;ed with a feeling more profound and true. Re&s;olved to in&s;truct both the French youth and the youth of other coun|tries who cultivate the French literature, he did not pardon the vices of language, the ex|travagance, nor the offences committed again&s;t delicacy and good ta&s;te, which are found in Corneille; but, at the &s;ame time, he taught them to know the progre&s;s which the art owes to that writer, the uncommon elevation of his mind, the almo&s;t inimitable beauty of his po|etry in the mor&s;els dictated by his genius, and tho&s;e va&s;t, &s;ublime, words which &s;pring &s;ud|denly from the nece&s;&s;ity of the occa&s;ion, and paint great characters with a &s;ingle &s;troke.</P>
<P>The herd of writers reproached him, never|thele&s;s, with a de&s;ign of degrading Corneille, from motives of mean jealou&s;y; whereas, throughout the whole of his commentary, he &s;eizes, he even &s;eems to &s;eek, occa&s;ion to pro|claim his admiration of Racine; a more dan|gerous rival, whom he has &s;urpa&s;&s;ed only in &s;ome parts of the tragic art, and who&s;e prodi|gious excellence he might well envy in the height of his glory.</P>

Never, in an event of &s;uch a nature, had circum&s;tances &s;o concurred to bani&s;h the &s;u&s;picion of a crime in the father, or to &s;trength|en the rea&s;ons to a&s;cribe &s;uicide to the &s;on. The young man's conduct, his character, the kind of reading in which he indulged, all con|firmed this idea. Yet a magi&s;trate, who&s;e weak mind was intoxicated with &s;uper&s;tition, and who&s;e hatred to the prote&s;tants did not he&s;itate to impute crimes to them, cau&s;ed the whole family to be impri&s;oned. The catholic populace became enflamed, and the young man was declared a martyr. The fraternity of the penitents, which, to the di&s;grace of the nation,
<PB N="127" REF="024210_0126_0FC56AA3201F30B8">
&s;till exi&s;ts at Thoulou&s;e, performed a &s;olemn ma&s;s for him, during which they bore his effi|gies, holding the palm of martyrdom in one hand, and in the other the pen with which he was to have &s;igned his abjuration.</P>
<P>It was &s;oon reported that the prote&s;tant re|ligion commanded fathers to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate their children, when they de&s;igned to abjure it; and that, for greater &s;ecurity, they elected, in their &s;ecret a&s;&s;emblies the butcher of the &s;ect. The inferior tribunal, led by the furious M. David, pronounced the unfortunate Calas guilty; and the parliament confirmed the &s;entence by that very &s;mall majority which is unhappily regard|ed as &s;ufficient by our ab&s;urd juri&s;prudence. Condemned to the torture and the wheel, this mi&s;erable father died prote&s;ting his innocence; and the judges ab&s;olved his family, the nece&s;|&s;ary accomplices of the guilt, or the innocence of its head.</P>
<P>This family, ruined and &s;tained by preju|dice, went to &s;eek, among men of their own per&s;ua&s;ion, a retreat, a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but, above all, con&s;olation. They took up their re&s;idence near Geneva. Voltaire, who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion was mov|ed, and who&s;e indignation was rou&s;ed, informed him&s;elf of the horrible particulars; and, a&s;&s;ured of the innocence of the unfortunate Calas, he dared to conceive the hope of obtaining ju&s;tice. The zeal of the advocates was excited, and their courage &s;u&s;tained by his letters. He in|tere&s;ted, in the cau&s;e of humanity, the natu|rally

&s;u&s;ceptible mind of the Duke de Choi&s;eul. The reputation of Tronchin had brought to Geneva the Duche&s;s d' Enville, the great grand|daughter of the author of the Maxims. Su|perior to &s;uper&s;tition, both by her native feelings and by her acquired knowledge, in|formed how to produce the welfare of mankind by equal activity and courage, and embelli&s;h|ing by a genuine mode&s;ty the energy of her virtues, her hatred of fanatici&s;m and oppre&s;&s;ion in&s;ured to Calas a protectre&s;s, who&s;e zeal could not be abated by ob&s;tacles or delays. The proce&s;s was commenced. To the memorials of the advocates, too profu&s;e and declamatory, Voltaire added more nervous writings, the &s;tyle of which was &s;eductive, and calculated in &s;ome places to excite pity, and in others to awaken the public indignation, &s;o prone to &s;leep among a people, at that time, too much a &s;tranger to their own intere&s;ts. Pleading for Calas, he &s;upported the cau&s;e of toleration; which word it was then daring to pronounce, and which is even now rejected with contempt by men who recognize the right of en&s;laving thought and con&s;cience. Letters, abounding with that &s;ubtle prai&s;e which he could di&s;tribute with &s;uch delicacy, animated the zeal of the de|fenders of the cau&s;e, of its protectors, and of the judges. It was, while he promi&s;ed im|mortality, that he demanded ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The &s;entence of Thoulou&s;e was annulled. The Duke de Choi&s;eul had the wi&s;dom and the
<PB N="129" REF="024210_0128_0FC56AA8DC330A38">
courage to order a tribunal of Ma&s;ters of Re|que&s;ts to revi&s;e this cau&s;e, in defending which the parliaments were all intere&s;ted, who&s;e pre|judices and &s;pirit of mutual defence left little hope of an equitable deci&s;ion. In fine, Calas was declared innocent; di&s;honour was remov|ed from his memory; and a generous mini&s;ter cau&s;ed the public trea&s;ury to repair the wrongs that the inju&s;tice of the judges had done to the fortune of this family, which was as re&s;pecta|ble as it was unhappy. But he did not proceed &s;o far as to compel the parliament of Langue|doc to acknowledge the arret which overturn|ed an act of its inju&s;tice. That tribunal pre|ferred the mi&s;erable vanity of per&s;evering in its error, to the honour of lamenting, and re|pairing, the injury.</P>
<P>Mean while, the applau&s;es of France and of Europe were heard at Thoulou&s;e, and the un|happy M. David, &s;inking beneath the weight of remor&s;e and of &s;hame, &s;oon lo&s;t his rea&s;on and his life. This affair, &s;o great in it&s;elf, &s;o important in its con&s;equences, &s;ince it turned the attention not only of France but of other nations to the crimes of intolerance and the nece&s;&s;ity of preventing them, this affair occu|pied the &s;oul of Voltaire, during more than three years.&mdash; "In all this time," &s;aid he, "a &s;mile has not e&s;caped me, for which I have not reproached my&s;elf, as for a crime." His name, which had long been dear to the enlightened friends of humanity as that of its mo&s;t zealous,
<PB N="130" REF="024210_0129_0FC56AAC067770F8">
mo&s;t indefatigable defender, this name was then ble&s;t by that multitude of citizens who, devoted to per&s;ecution during eighty years, at length heard a voice rai&s;ed in their defence. Having returned to Paris in 1778, one day that the people &s;urrounded him on the Pont Royal, a poor woman was a&s;ked who that man was who thus drew the crowd after him&mdash;"Know you not," &s;aid &s;he, "that he is the &s;aviour of Calas?" He was informed of this an&s;wer, and, &s;urrounded as he was by the marks of admira|tion which were lavi&s;hed on him, it was this by which he was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected.</P>
<P>Shortly after the unfortunate death of Ca|las, a young woman of the &s;ame province, who, according to a barbarous cu&s;tom, had been taken from her parents and &s;hut up in a con|vent with a de&s;ign of aiding &s;aying grace by human means, wearied of the ill treatment that &s;he endured, e&s;caped, and her body was di&s;|covered in a well. The prie&s;t who had &s;oli|cited the Lettre de Cachet, the &s;i&s;terhood who had u&s;ed with barbarity the power which it gave them over this unfortunate young wo|man, doubtle&s;s merited puni&s;hment; but it was on the family of this victim that fanatici&s;m wi&s;h|ed puni&s;hment to fall. The injurious reproach which had conducted Calas to the wheel was revived with a new fury. Sirven, fortunately, had time to fly; and, condemned to death for contumacy, he &s;ought an a&s;&s;ylum with the pro|tector of Calas. But his wife, who accompa|nied
<PB N="131" REF="024210_0130_0FC56AB05684C928">
him, fell a prey to her grief and to the fatigue of a journey, undertaken on foot, over tracts of &s;now.</P>
<P>Judicial forms required Sirven to pre&s;ent him&s;elf before the &s;ame parliament who had &s;hed the blood of Calas. Voltaire endeavour|ed to obtain other judges. The Duke de Choi&s;eul at that time thought it nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;pect the opinion of the parliaments who, after the decay of his influence over the Marchione&s;s de Pompadour, and again after her death, were become u&s;eful to him, at times to free him from an enemy, and at others to afford the means of rendering him&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary by the art with which he could appea&s;e their commoti|ons, which he him&s;elf frequently excited.</P>
<P>Sirven, then, was compelled to yield to ne|ce&s;&s;ity, and to appear before the tribunal of Thoulou&s;e; but Voltaire knew how to provide for his &s;ecurity, and to prepare for his &s;ucce&s;s. He had di&s;ciples in the parliament; &s;ome able advocates of Thoulou&s;e wi&s;hed to partake of the glory which tho&s;e of Paris had acquired by defending Calas; the friends of toleration were become powerful even in this very city: with|in a few years Voltaire's works had changed the minds of men; they had only pitied Calas with a &s;ilent horror, Sirven found declared pro|tectors, for which he was indebted to the elo|quence of Voltaire, to the talent of opportune|ly infu&s;ing truth, mingled with approbation, into the feelings of tho&s;e whom he de&s;igned to
<PB N="132" REF="024210_0131_0FC56AB34C0FD078">
work his purpo&s;es. The friends of truth tri|umphed over the abettors of the penitents, and Sirven was &s;aved.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits had u&s;urped the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of a well de&s;cended family, who, by their poverty, were prevented from recovering their rights. Voltaire gave them the means of accompli&s;h|ing that; and oppre&s;&s;ors of every kind, who, long had feared his writings, now learnt to dread his activity, his genero&s;ity, and his cou|rage.</P>
<P>This la&s;t event almo&s;t immediately preceded the de&s;truction of the Je&s;uits. Voltaire, edu|cated among them, had maintained a corre|&s;pondence with his former ma&s;ters. While they were living they re&s;trained the fury of the fraternity from any open attack, and Vol|taire was re&s;pectful to the Je&s;uits, both in de|ference to the connexions of his youth, and al|&s;o to pre&s;erve allies in the party which at that time governed the devotees, But, after the death of the&s;e friends, wearied by the clamours of the Journal de Tr&eacute;voux, which, by uncea&s;|ing accu&s;ations of impiety &s;eemed to call down per&s;ecutions on his head, he no longer pre&s;erv|ed the &s;ame re&s;pect for the Je&s;uits, nor did his zeal for the defence of the oppre&s;&s;ed extend to them, when they, in their turn, became op|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>He exulted in the de&s;truction of an order, the friend of letters but the enemy of rea&s;on, which was de&s;irous of de&s;troying all talents or
<PB N="133" REF="024210_0132_0FC56AB4F54A41F8">
of drawing them into its bo&s;om, to corrupt them, by employing them to &s;erve its de&s;igns, and to hold the human race in infancy, in or|der to govern them. Yet he pitied individuals treated with barbarity by the hatred of the Jan&s;eni&s;ts; and he gave an a&s;&s;ylum, in his own hou&s;e, to a Je&s;uit, to point out to the devo|tees that true humanity knows only misfortune and forgets opinions. Father Adam, to whom a &s;ort of celebrity was given by his abode at Ferney, was not ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s to his ho&s;t. He played with him at che&s;s, and he played the game with &s;ufficient addre&s;s &s;ometimes to conceal his &s;uperiority. He al&s;o &s;pared Vol|taire labour in his learned re&s;earches; he even &s;erved him as an almoner, for Voltaire wi&s;hed to oppo&s;e his fidelity in fulfilling the exterior duties of the Romi&s;h religion to the accu&s;ati|on, which were brought again&s;t him, of im|piety.</P>
<P>At this period a great revolution was en|gendering in the human mind. Since the revival of philo&s;ophy, religion, exclu&s;ively e&s;ta|bli&s;hed throughout Europe, had been attacked only in England. Leibnitz, Fontenelle, and other le&s;s celebrated philo&s;ophers, accu&s;ed of free thinking, had re&s;pected religion in their writings. Bayle, him&s;elf, by a precaution that was nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;afety, while he indulged him&s;elf in all objections, a&s;&s;umed the air of wi&s;h|ing to prove that revelation alone could re|&s;olve them, and of having formed the project
<PB N="134" REF="024210_0133_0FC56AB99F7D10D0">
of exalting faith by humiliating rea&s;on. In England, the&s;e attacks had little &s;ucce&s;s or ef|fect. The mo&s;t powerful party in that nation judged it u&s;eful to them&s;elves to leave the peo|ple in darkne&s;s, probably becau&s;e the habit of adoring the my&s;teries of the Bible &s;trengthened their faith in tho&s;e of the con&s;titution; and they honoured the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion as a &s;pe|cies of &s;ocial advantage. Be&s;ides, in a coun|try where the Hou&s;e of Commons alone led to fortune, and where the members of that hou&s;e were tumultuou&s;ly elected by the people, an apparent re&s;pect for their opinions mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be erected into a virtue by all the ambitious.</P>
<P>In France, there had appeared &s;ome bold writers, but the blows which they aimed were &s;till indirect. Even the work of Helvetius de l' E&s;prit (on the under&s;tanding) was only an at|tack on religious principles in general; it que&s;|tioned the foundations of all religions, and left the reader to draw con&s;equences and make ap|plications. Emilius appeared; the Savoyard vicar's Profe&s;&s;ion of Faith contained nothing relative to the utility, toward morals, of the belief of a God, and the inutility of revelation, which is not to be found in the poem of Na|tural Law; but the attack was open and the per&s;ons attacked were brought upon the &s;tage under their proper name and character, and not under that of the prie&s;ts of India or of Thi|bet. This boldne&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed Voltaire and ex|cited his emulation. The &s;ucce&s;s of Emilius
<PB N="135" REF="024210_0134_0FC56ABAF9D8BF10">
encouraged him, nor was he terrified by the fear of per&s;ecution. Rou&s;&s;eau had not been per&s;ecuted at Paris had he not put his name to the work, nor at Geneva had he not maintain|ed in another part of Emilius that the people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not the power of renouncing the right of reforming a depraved government. This doctrine authori&s;ed the citizens of that repub|lic to overthrow the ari&s;tocracy which its ma|gi&s;trates had e&s;tabli&s;hed, and which &s;ecured an hereditary authority to certain rich families.</P>
<P>Voltaire believed that he could &s;ecurely &s;hun per&s;ecution by concealing his name; and, by a deference to government while he direct|ed all his force again&s;t religion, could intere&s;t even the civil power to weaken its empire. A multiplicity of works, in which he &s;ucce&s;&s;ively employed argument and humour, were di&s;per|&s;ed throughout Europe, under the various forms which could be invented by the nece&s;&s;ity of veiling truth, or of rendering it engaging. His zeal again&s;t religion, which he viewed as the cau&s;e of the fanataci&s;m that had de&s;olated Europe from the moment of its birth, the cau&s;e of the &s;uper&s;tition that had degraded it, and as the &s;ource of the evils, which the enemies of men &s;till continued to inflict on them, &s;eem|ed to increa&s;e his activity and his powers. "I am wearied," &s;aid he one day, "of hearing it repeated that twelve men were &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h Chri&s;tianity, and I wi&s;h to prove there needs but one to de&s;troy it."</P>

He excited indignation, he wrung tears from the heart, he exhau&s;ted the &s;prings of ridicule. Men trembled at an attrocious action, they laughed at an ab&s;urdity. Voltaire did not fear fre|quently to place the &s;ame objects before his readers, to urge the &s;ame rea&s;onings to them. "They tell me that I repeat the &s;ame things," he &s;aid in one of his writings, "true: I &s;hall repeat them till I &s;ee men reformed."</P>
<P>The&s;e works, rigorou&s;ly prohibited in France, in Italy, at Vienna, in Portugal, and in Spain, could not be &s;peedily circulated; all of them could not reach every reader; but there was not an ob&s;cure corner in the provinces, there was not any nation in foreign countries, &s;uffering under the yoke of intolerance, which
<PB N="137" REF="024210_0136_0FC56AC01812C7E0">
did not feel the influence of &s;ome of the&s;e wri|tings.</P>
<P>Men of liberal minds, who exi&s;ted before only in &s;ome cities where &s;cience was cultiva|ted, or among the learned and the great, were, by his voice, multiplied in all cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety as well as in all countries. Soon perceiving their number and their &s;trength they ventured to &s;how them&s;elves, and Europe was a&s;toni&s;h|ed to find it&s;elf a country of Dei&s;ts.</P>
<P>The zeal of Voltaire created him enemies in all tho&s;e who had obtained, and all who ex|pected to obtain, affluence or even &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from religion. Yet that party no longer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed &s;uch men as Bo&s;&s;uet, Arnaud, and Nicole; tho&s;e who replaced them by their talents and their acquaintance with philo&s;ophy and letters had ranged them&s;elves with the contrary party; and the members of the clergy who approach|ed neare&s;t to them in ability, yielding to the de&s;ire of not deba&s;ing them&s;elves in the opini|on of enlightened men, &s;tood aloof, or content|ed them&s;elves with maintaining the politcal u&s;e of a belief which they would have blu&s;hed to have partaken with the people, and &s;ub&s;ti|tuted for the credulous &s;uper&s;tition of their predece&s;&s;ors a &s;pecies of religious Machiavel|i&s;m.</P>
<P>Defamatory writings and attacks &s;prung up profu&s;ely; but Voltaire, by an&s;wering alone, pre&s;erved the name of the&s;e works, which were read by none but tho&s;e to whom they were u&s;e|le&s;s,
<PB N="138" REF="024210_0137_0FC56AC1188AFD50">
and who were unwilling or unable to un|der&s;tand either the objections or the an&s;wers.</P>
<P>To the clamours of fanatici&s;m, Voltaire op|po&s;ed the protection of monarchs. The Em|pre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, the Kings of Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Pru&s;&s;ia, intere&s;ted them&s;elves in his labours, peru&s;ed his works, &s;ought to de|&s;erve his approbation, and &s;ometimes &s;econded his zeal for the welfare of mankind. In eve|ry country the powerful, and &s;uch mini&s;ters as &s;ought reputation and were intent on &s;pread|ing their fame through Europe, were ambitious to enjoy the &s;uffrage of the philo&s;opher of Fer|ney, confided to him their hopes and fears for the progre&s;s of rea&s;on, and their projects for the increa&s;e of knowledge and the ruin of fa|natici&s;m. He had formed a league which in|cluded all the great men of Europe, of which he was the &s;oul, and who&s;e cry was, "Rea&s;on and toleration." Did any &s;triking inju&s;tice ari&s;e in a nation, did Voltaire hear of any act of bigotry, any in&s;ult offered to human nature, his pen expo&s;ed the guilty to Europe: and who knows how often the fear of this &s;ure and terrible vengeance has withheld the oppre&s;&s;|or's arm?</P>
<P>But it was in France, more e&s;pecially, that he exerci&s;ed this dominion of rea&s;on. Since the affair of Calas, every victim, unju&s;tly &s;a|crificed or pur&s;ued by the &s;word of the law, found in him a protector, or an avenger.</P>

<P>Yet, Voltaire during a long time &s;poke &s;in|gly again&s;t this enormity.

But Vol|taire, by reiterated attacks on the &s;ame object, triumphed over prejudice and the intere&s;ts of &s;uch as are attentive to pre&s;erve and extend its empire. Ju&s;t minds needed only to be inform|ed of the circum&s;tances; others, he hurried along with him; and when the &s;on of the Count de Lally, &s;ince &s;o celebrated by his eloquence and courage, had attained an age at which he could demand ju&s;tice, the minds of men were prepared to applaud the attempt and to &s;olicit its execution. Voltaire was dying, when, twelve years afterward, this unju&s;t &s;entence was rever&s;ed; he heard the intelligence; his powers &s;prang back to life, and he wrote&mdash;"I die content; I &s;ee the king loves ju&s;tice."

of Abbeville, was in&s;ulted, during the night. The indignation of the people was heightened and kept in action by the ridiculous ceremony of doing penance. The bi&s;hop of Amiens, go|verned in his old age by fanatics, and no long|er capable of fore&s;eeing the con&s;equences of this religions farce, added to its &s;olemnity by his pre&s;ence.

A proce&s;s was commenced, and the judges of Abbeville condemned to tortures, who&s;e horror would di&s;may the imagination of a canibal, the Chevalier de la Barr&eacute; and d' Etal|londe his friend, who had taken the precaution to fly. The Chevalier de la Barr&eacute; had awaited the i&s;&s;ue of the trial; he had more to lo&s;e than the other by quitting France; and relied on the protection of his relations who filled the fir&s;t employments in the parliaments and in the council.

<P>While Voltaire's indignation was reu&s;ed, his apprehen&s;ions were &s;trongly excited. The Philo&s;ophical Dictionary had been artfully pla|ced among the number of books before which it was &s;aid the Chevalier de la Barr&eacute; had pro|&s;trated him&s;elf. His enemies wi&s;hed it to be under&s;tood that the reading of Voltaire's works had been the cau&s;e of the&s;e indi&s;cretions, which had been con&s;trued into acts of impiety. Still the danger did not prevent Voltaire from un|dertaking the defence of the&s;e victims of fanati|ci&s;m. D'Ettallonde, then a refugee at Wezel, obtained, through his recommendation, a com|mi&s;&s;ion in a Pru&s;&s;ian regiment. The circum|&s;tances of the affair of Abbeville were unfolded to Europe in &s;everal publications; and the judges trembled, on their very &s;eats, at the terrible judgment which they had pa&s;&s;ed, and which dragged them from their ob&s;curity to devote them to a di&s;graceful immortality.</P>

<P>Voltaire did not, meantime, neglect the means of avoiding the &s;torm; he dimini&s;hed his dome&s;tic e&s;tabli&s;hment; and &s;ecured &s;ome property which he could di&s;po&s;e of at plea&s;ure, with which he might procure a new place of refuge. Such had ever been his &s;ecret de&s;ign, in all the arrangements which he had made of his fortune, and it would have required a league among the powers of Europe, to have deprived him of independence, and to have reduced him to want. Princes and nobles were among his debtors, who do not indeed pay with much punctuality, but he had calculated the degrees of human corruption, and he knew that the&s;e &s;ame men, though they act with lit|tle delicacy in &s;uch affairs, would find means to reimbur&s;e him during the moment of per|&s;ecution, when their negligence would other|wi&s;e render them the objects of the horror and di&s;dain of Europe, indignant to behold &s;uch a man oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This per&s;ecution appeared for a time ready to bur&s;t forth. Ferney is &s;ituated in the dio|ces of Geneva, the titular bi&s;hop of which re|&s;ides in the &s;mall town of Annecy. Fran&ccedil;ois

de Salles, who has been rai&s;ed to the rank of Saints, having formerly been the bi&s;hop, in order that the heretics might not find cau&s;e of &s;candal in their own metropolis, it had been thought mo&s;t proper to confide this &s;ee to none but a man who would not incur the reproach of pride, luxury, and effeminacy, of which the ca|tholic prelates are accu&s;ed by the prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>But it had long been difficult to di&s;cover &s;aints, who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing under&s;tanding or birth, would conde&s;cend to accept &s;o &s;mall a dio|ce&s;e. He who filled the &s;ee of Annecy, in 1767, was a man of low extraction, educated in a &s;eminary at Paris, where he was no otherwi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed than by au&s;tere manners, trifling devotion, and ignorant fanatici&s;m. He wrote to the Count de St. Florentine, to induce him to bani&s;h Voltaire out of his dioce&s;e, and con|&s;equently out of the kingdom, though the poet had then built a church at his own expence, and &s;pread abundance through a country which the per&s;ecutions again&s;t the prote&s;tants had laid wa&s;te.

bear him the tribute of admiration. The mi|&s;ter, had it been only from motives of policy, could not be tempted to gratify the bi&s;hop; he therefore advi&s;ed Voltaire to guard again&s;t the&s;e accu&s;ations, which the union of the bi|&s;hop of Annecy with the French prelates who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more influence might render dan|gerous.</P>
<P>It was at this time that he conceived the idea of &s;olemnly receiving the &s;acrament, which was followed by a public declaration of his re|&s;pect for the church, and his di&s;dain of his de|tractors; a fruitle&s;s &s;tep, which &s;poke weak|ne&s;s rather than policy, and which the plea&s;ure of compelling his pa&s;tor to admini&s;ter the com|munion through fear of the &s;ecular judges, and of legally in&s;ulting the bi&s;hop of Annecy, could not excu&s;e in the eyes of the free and intrepid man who appreciates coolly the rights of truth, and perceives that which prudence requires when laws contrary to natural ju&s;tice render truth dangerous and prudence nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>The prie&s;t &s;uffered the &s;mall advantage to e&s;cape which they might have drawn from this &s;ingular &s;cene, by fal&s;ifying the declaration which Voltaire had made.</P>
<P>He had no longer a retreat near Geneva. He had connected him&s;elf, on his arrival there, with the families who&s;e education, opinions, inclinations, and fortune, were mo&s;t congenial to his own; and the&s;e families had at that time
<PB N="148" REF="024210_0147_0FC56ADB4A229EA8">
formed the de&s;ign of e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;pecies of ari&s;tocracy. In a city which po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ed no ter|ritory, where the &s;trength of the citizens could be united with as much facility and prompti|tude as that of the government, &s;uch a project would have been ab&s;urd had not the rich citi|zens entertained the hope of engaging a fo|reign influence in their favour.</P>
<P>The cabinets of Ver&s;ailles and Turin were ea&s;ily &s;educed. The &s;enate of Berne, who&s;e intere&s;t it was to bani&s;h the picture of repub|lican equality from the eyes of their &s;ubjects, made it their con&s;tant policy to protect every enterprizing ari&s;tocracy around them: and, throughout the whole of Switzerland, &s;uch ma|gi&s;trates as became tyrants were &s;ure of find|ing, at Bern, an ardent and faithful protector. Thus the wretched pride of obtaining an odi|ous authority in a &s;mall city, and of being ha|ted without being re&s;pected, deprived the citi|zens of Geneva of their liberty, and the re|public of its independence. The chiefs of the popular party employed the weapons of fana|tici&s;m, for they had read enough to know the influence which religion had formerly obtained in political di&s;&s;en&s;ions, but they did not &s;uffi|ciently under&s;tand the &s;pirit of their own age to feel how much rea&s;on, aided by ridicule, had weakened this formerly &s;o dangerous wea|pon.</P>
<P>It was propo&s;ed, therefore, to put in force the laws which prohibited catholics from po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
<PB N="149" REF="024210_0148_0FC56AE2D47EEED8">
property in the territory of Geneva. The magi&s;trates were cen&s;ured for their con|nections with Voltaire, who had dared to rai&s;e his voice again&s;t the barbarous a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion of Servet, which had been commanded by Calvin in the name of God to the cowardly and &s;uper&s;titious &s;enators of Geneva. Voltaire was obliged to renounce his hou&s;e of the Delices.</P>
<P>Soon after, Rou&s;&s;eau advanced, in his Emi|lius, principles which developed to the citizens of Geneva all the extent of their rights, and which founded the&s;e rights on &s;imple truths that all men could feel and all mu&s;t adopt. The ari&s;tocracy wi&s;hed to puni&s;h him for the publication, but it was nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould have a pretext; they took that of religion, and united them&s;elves with the prie&s;ts, who, in every country, indifferent to the form of its con&s;titution and the liberty of man, promi&s;e the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven to the party which mo&s;t favours intolerance, and who become, as their intere&s;t directs, &s;ometimes the &s;upport of the tyranny of a bigotted prince or of a &s;uper&s;titious &s;enate, &s;ometimes the defenders of the liberty of a fanatic people.</P>
<P>Alternately expo&s;ed to the attacks of the two parties, Voltaire ob&s;erved a neutrality, but he remained faithful to his dete&s;tation of oppre&s;&s;ors. He favoured the cau&s;e of the citi|zens again&s;t the magi&s;trates, and that of the common people who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no privileges

again&s;t the citizens; for the&s;e people, con|demned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be ever excluded from the rights of the citizens, found them&s;elves more oppre&s;&s;|ed &s;ince the latter, better informed of the pri|vileges which are granted by the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of polity, but le&s;s enlightened re&s;pecting the natural rights of man, con&s;idering them&s;elves as &s;overeigns, of whom the people were no more than &s;ubjects, and whom they thought they had authority to reduce to &s;ubjection, by the &s;ame arbitrary power, for a&s;&s;uming which they deemed their magi&s;trates &s;o culpable.</P>
<P>Voltaire, therefore, wrote a poem, every part of which was impregnated with &s;atire, and on which was no reproach can be laid, except that of containing &s;ome ver&s;es again&s;t Rou&s;|&s;eau, which were dictated by a degree of an|ger, who&s;e exce&s;s and expre&s;&s;ions could not be excu&s;ed by the ju&s;tice of the motives which in&s;pired them. But when, in a tumult, the citizens had &s;lain &s;ome of the people, he was eager to receive at Ferney the families which the&s;e troubles compelled to abandon Geneva; and, in the very in&s;tant in which the bankruptcy of the Abb&eacute; Terrai, which had not even the excu&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, but was occa&s;ion|ed only by &s;hameful expences, had deprived him of part of his fortune, he was &s;een to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to tho&s;e who had no property left; and to build hou&s;es which he &s;old to others at a low price to be paid him in annuities; while he &s;olicited the good offices of the government in
<PB N="151" REF="024210_0150_0FC56AE5F203C988">
their behalf, and employed his influence with &s;overeigns, mini&s;ters, and the leading men of all nations, to procure a &s;ale for the clocks and watches of this infant manufactory, which &s;oon became famous throughout Europe.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the government was em|ployed in opening an a&s;ylum for the Geneve&s;e at Ver&s;oy, on the borders of the lake. There it was de&s;igned to have e&s;tabli&s;hed a city, in which indu&s;try and commerce would have been free, and in which a prote&s;tant temple would have ri&s;en by the &s;ide of a catholic church. Voltaire had cau&s;ed this plan to be adopted, but the mini&s;ter did not po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ufficient credit to obtain a law for the protection of religious li|berty, a &s;ecret toleration, limited to the time of his own admini&s;tration, was all that he could offer, and with that Ver&s;oy could not exi&s;t.</P>
<P>The year 1771 was one of the mo&s;t embar|ra&s;&s;ing periods of Voltaire's life. The chan|cellor Maupeou and the Duke d'Aiguillon &s;aw them&s;elves obliged to attack the parliaments, to whom they both were objects of hatred; that they might not become their victims. The one could not obtain a part in the admini&s;tration, nor the other pre&s;erve him&s;elf in the office which he held there, without procuring the di&s;|grace of the Duke de Choi&s;eul. Acting in concert with Madame du Barry, whom that mini&s;ter had been imprudent enough to make his irreconcilable enemy, they per&s;uaded the king that his contemned authority could never
<PB N="152" REF="024210_0151_0FC56AE9885EF990">
be re&s;tored to its vigour, that the &s;tate, ince&s;|&s;antly agitated &s;ince the peace by parliament|ary contentions, could not regain its tran|quility, if he did not by an act of vigour place limits to the preten&s;ions of the judicial bodies, which they would not venture to infringe, and if a term was not fixed beyond which they would not dare longer to oppo&s;e re&s;i&s;tance to the royal will.</P>
<P>The Duke de Choi&s;eul could not adopt this project without offending the public opinion, which had a long time been inimicable to him, but which was then his &s;ole &s;upport; while his forced &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of the people had removed him &s;till further from the confidence of the monarch, who&s;e affections were alienat|ed from him. It was probable, then, that his connexions with the parliaments would com|plete his di&s;grace, and that it would be ea&s;y to per&s;uade the monarch either that his re|maining in power would be the greate&s;t ob&s;ta|cle to the &s;ucce&s;s of the new mea&s;ures of the government, or that he would endeavour to involve the nation in war, to pre&s;erve his &s;ituation in de&s;pight of the kings plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The attack made on the parliaments was directed with equal addre&s;s. Whatever could alarm the nation was carefully avoided. The king appeared only to vindicate the plenitude of the legi&s;lative power, a power which would be transferred not to the nation but to the par|liaments, by admitting the doctrine that the
<PB N="153" REF="024210_0152_0FC56AEE05A1B238">
parliaments had the right of regi&s;tering edicts according to their plea&s;ure. It was ea&s;ily per|ceived that this power, united to the mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive judicial authority, which was divided among the twelve perpetual tribunals, would tend to e&s;tabli&s;h a tyranic ari&s;tocracy in France, more dangerous, than monarchy, to the &s;ecu|rity, the liberty, and the property of the citi|zens. The enemies of tho&s;e tribunals might therefore rely on the &s;uffrages of enlightened minds, and on that of men of letters, whom the parliament of Paris had wounded by its in|&s;olence and per&s;ecution, by its attachment to prejudices, and by its pertinacity in rejecting every improvement calculated for the happi|ne&s;s of men.</P>
<P>But is le&s;s difficult to form a political in|trigue w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h addre&s;s, than to execute with wi&s;|dom a plan of reform. The more alarming to liberty are the principles which the govern|ing power would e&s;tabli&s;h, the more nece&s;&s;ary is it to di&s;play gentlene&s;s and indulgence to individuals. Yet, at that time, rigour was, in the minute&s;t circum&s;tances, carried to a pu|erile refinement. A monarch appears cruel, who, in the puni&s;hments which he inflicts, does not &s;crupulou&s;ly re&s;pect, con&s;i&s;tently with that puni&s;hment, whatever can be injurious to the health, the convenience, or even the natural feelings of tho&s;e whom he puni&s;hes, or tho&s;e who are connected with them; but, on this oc|ca&s;ion, all the&s;e con&s;iderations were di&s;regard|ed.
<PB N="154" REF="024210_0153_0FC56AF1E77FA608">
They refu&s;ed permi&s;&s;ion to a &s;on to em|brace his dying father; they confined a man in an unhealthful place, where his family could not approach him without being expo&s;ed to partake of his dangers, and a &s;ick per&s;on could &s;carcely obtain leave to &s;eek in the capital the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which that alone could give him. When an ab&s;olute government betrays fear, it proclaims either di&s;tru&s;t of its &s;trength, the in|deci&s;ion of the monarch, or the in&s;tability of the admini&s;tration, and this gives encourage|ment to re&s;i&s;tance; but this fear was di&s;played in making the recal of &s;ome exiles depend on a con&s;ent u&s;ele&s;s even in the opinion of tho&s;e who demanded that con&s;ent.</P>
<P>A &s;alutary operation does not change its na|ture though it be executed with wanton &s;eve|rity; but then the feeling and enlightened man who approves, does not defend it, &s;hould he think his duty calls on him to give the mea|&s;ure his &s;upport, without regret; his di&s;gu&s;t|ed mind no longer acts with either zeal or af|fection for a cau&s;e which is di&s;honoured by its leaders.</P>

<P>However, the barbarity of the criminal law, the di&s;gu&s;ting defects of the civil juri&s;prudence, pre&s;ented to the authors of the revolution &s;ure means to regain the public opinion, and to give tho&s;e who &s;hould con&s;ent to replace the for|mer parliaments an excu&s;e which honour and patrioti&s;m might have been proud to avow.

The parliament, who&s;e gratitude obliged them to a&s;&s;ume firmne&s;s, was &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed. The Duke d'Aiguillon became mini&s;ter, and the parliament was &s;ucceeded by a new tribunal. In &s;ome of the provinces the parliaments experienced the fate of that of Paris, while others con&s;ented to remain and &s;acrifice &s;everal of their members. All was &s;ilent before authority; and nothing was want|ing to the &s;ucce&s;s of the mini&s;ters but the ap|probation of the public whom they &s;corned, and who, &s;ome years after, wrought their dis|grace.</P>

All his letters expre&s;&s;ed his regard for the Duke de Choi&s;eul with freedom and energy, and he was not ignorant that his let|ters, in con&s;equence of the infamous cu&s;tom of violating public faith, were read by the ene|mies of the exiled mini&s;ter. A plea&s;ant tale, entitled Barm&eacute;cide<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The letter of Benaldaki to Caramu&s;ti.

The inju&s;tice with which the friends and partizans of the Duke de Choi&s;eul accu&s;ed Voltaire of ingratitude was, therefore, one of the &s;evere&s;t afflictions which he had ever endured; and it was the more poignant as the Duke him&s;elf partook of the inju&s;tice. Ineffectually did Voltaire en|deavour to undeceive him, ineffectually did he appeal to the proofs he had given of his attachment and his &s;orrow:

They con&s;ider him as a man made to defend the cau&s;e which they have embraced and not to &s;upport his own principles; to &s;erve under them and not to examine the ju&s;tice of the war. Thus the Duke de Choi&s;eul appeared to imagine that Voltaire, in deference to him, ought either to have betrayed or concealed his opinions on que&s;tions of public right. An important anecdote, which proves how ea&s;ily the pride of power and birth de&s;troys the re|collection of the natural independence of the human &s;oul, and which di&s;plays the inequality of men's minds, which is much more real than that of their rank or &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Voltaire beheld, with plea&s;ure, the prac|tice of &s;elling judicial offices aboli&s;hed, the fees of the judges &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the immen&s;e juri&s;diction of the parliament of Paris con|tracted within narrower limits: abu&s;es which he had combated, for more than forty years, with the weapons of rea&s;on and ridicule. He pre|ferred a &s;ingle ma&s;ter to many; a &s;overeign who&s;e prejudices are alone to be feared to a troop of de&s;pots who&s;e prejudices are greater

He was wont to &s;ay: "I have a &s;tubborn back; I can make a &s;ingle how well enough, but a hundred bows in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion are too fatiguing."</P>
<P>He therefore applauded the regulations which had been adopted, and, among men of congenial minds, he expre&s;&s;ed his approbation. Doubtle&s;s, he perceived with what contracted views this happy opportunity of reforming the legi&s;lation, of un&s;hackling the mind and re|&s;toring to man the rights of men, of at once pro&s;cribing intolerance and barbarity, and, in fine, of dating from this moment, the epoch of a revolution propitious to the nation, glo|rious to the prince and his mini&s;ters, had been neglected and lo&s;t. But Voltaire had al&s;o too much penetration not to feel that though the laws were the &s;ame the magi&s;trates were chang|ed; that if even the&s;e &s;hould inherit the &s;pirit of their predece&s;&s;ors neither their credit not their in&s;olence could de&s;cend to them, that the innovation, by depriving them of the blind re&s;pect which the vulgar entertained for all that bears the ru&s;t of antiquity, had deprived them of much of their power, that the public voice could alone re&s;tore their influence, and to obtain its &s;uffrage there remained no other means than that of li&s;tening to rea&s;on and of

<P>The approbation which Voltaire gave to the mea&s;ures of the Chancellor Maupeou, was at lea&s;t &s;erviceable to the oppre&s;&s;ed. Though he could not procure ju&s;tice to be done to the memory of the unfortunate la Barr&eacute;, though he could not re&s;tore the young d'Etallonde to his country, though the mini&s;ters pu&s;illanimous re&s;pect for the clergy concealed from him the true intere&s;t of his glory, &s;till Voltaire had the happine&s;s to &s;ave the wife of Mountbailli. This unhappy man, accu&s;ed of parricide, had per|i&s;hed on the wheel; his wife was al&s;o condemn|ed to death; but &s;he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be preg|nant, and was fortunate enough to obtain a re&s;pite.</P>
<P>The tribunals had ju&s;t rejected a provident law which, placing an interval between judg|ment and execution in which the truth might be di&s;covered and innocence di&s;played, would have prevented almo&s;t all their unju&s;t deci&s;ions; and they had refu&s;ed it with an intemperance which &s;ufficed to prove its nece&s;&s;ity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is but ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve that all the magi&s;trates did not entertain this high idea of their rights, and this love of power.

<P>The trial of the wife of Mountbailli was revi&s;ed; the council of Artois, by which &s;he had been condemned, declared her innocence; and, more noble or le&s;s pre&s;umptuous than the par|liament of Thoulou&s;e, they lamented the irre|parable misfortune of having cau&s;ed an in|nocent per&s;on to peri&s;h, and they impo&s;ed on them&s;elves the duty of providing for the re|maining days of the unfortunate woman who&s;e happine&s;s they had de&s;troyed.</P>

The menaces of religion a&s;&s;umed new vigour to terrify him on the appearance of the lea&s;t danger; but he imagined that a promi&s;e of continence &s;o ea&s;ily made on a death-bed, and certain words from the mouth of a prie&s;t, could expiate the errors of a reign of &s;ixty years. Even more ti|mid than &s;uper&s;titious, accu&s;tomed by the Car|dinal de Fleury to con&s;ider liberty of thought as a cau&s;e of di&s;order in &s;tates, or at lea&s;t of embarra&s;&s;ment to governments, it was never|thele&s;s in de&s;pight of him&s;elf that under his reign human rea&s;on made a rapid progre&s;s in France. He who laboured for its advancement with mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s and &s;plendour was become the object of his hatred. Yet he re&s;pected in Voltaire the glory of France; and could not view, without pride, the admiration of Europe place one of his &s;ubjects in the fir&s;t rank of illu&s;trious characters.</P>
<P>His death made no change in Voltaire's &s;ituation. To the prejudices of Cardinal de Fleury, M. Maurepas joined a &s;till more im|placable hatred of all tho&s;e who ro&s;e &s;uperior to the ordinary cla&s;s of men.</P>
<P>Voltaire had been profu&s;e of his exaggerat|ed prai&s;e of Louis XV. till the time of his vi&s;it to the court of Pru&s;&s;ia, but without being able to di&s;arm the king's unju&s;t di&s;like of him. He

had ob&s;erved an almo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;ilence from the period in which the errors and misfortunes of this reign would have rendered eulogy ab|ject. But after the death of that monarch he dared to be ju&s;t to his memory, at the in&s;tant in which nearly the whole nation &s;eemed hap|py in wounding his name. It has been remark|ed that the philo&s;ophers, whom Louis XV. did not patronize, were at that time the only per|&s;ons who ob&s;erved &s;ome impartiality; while the prie&s;ts, laden with his benefactions, in|&s;ulted his weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>The new reign &s;oon pre&s;ented to Voltaire hopes which he had not dared to form. M. Turgot was called to the admini&s;tration. Vol|taire knew him to be a man of profound ge|nius, who, in every &s;pecies of &s;cience, had created &s;ure and determinate principles on which he had founded all his opinions, and according to which he directed the whole of his conduct; a glory that no other &s;tate&s;man has been worthy of partaking with him. He knew that, to a &s;oul zealous for the truth and for the happine&s;s of man, M. Turgot united fortitude that was above all fear, and gran|deur of character &s;uperior to all di&s;&s;imulation; that in his eyes the mo&s;t important &s;ituation was but the means of executing his &s;alutary views; and appeared to him no more than a vile &s;lavery when that hope &s;hould be lo&s;t. In fine, Voltaire knew that, free from all preju|dices and dete&s;ting, in tho&s;e prejudices, the
<PB N="174" REF="024210_0173_0FC56B276553C558">
mo&s;t dangerous enemies of the human race, M. Turgot regarded the liberty of thought and of the pre&s;s as the right of each citizen, and the right of entire nations, who&s;e happi|ne&s;s the progre&s;s of rea&s;on alone can e&s;tabli&s;h on an immoveable ba&s;is.</P>
<P>In the nomination of M. Turgot, Voltaire &s;aw the dawn of the reign of rea&s;on; &s;o long di&s;avowed and much longer per&s;ecuted; he dared to look for the rapid fall of prejudices, and for the de&s;truction of that cowardly and tyrannic policy which, to flatter the pride or indolence of men in place, had condemned the people to humiliation and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Yet his attempts in favour of the va&s;&s;als of Mount Jura were ineffectual; and in vain he endeavoured to obtain for d'Etallonde, and for the memory of the Chevalier de la Barr&eacute;, that di&s;tingui&s;hed ju&s;tice which humanity and the national honour equally required. The&s;e ob|jects were foreign to the department of the finances; and that &s;uperiority of information, of character, and of virtue, which M. Turgot could not conceal, had created him, in the other mini&s;ters and in the intriguing &s;ubalterns of office, too many enemies; who, finding neither ambition nor per&s;onal projects to op|po&s;e in him, bent them&s;elves again&s;t all that they believed con&s;onant with his ju&s;t and be|neficent de&s;igns</P>
<P>Be&s;ide, liberty could not be re&s;tored to the va&s;&s;als of mount Jura without offending the

parliament of Befan&ccedil;on; the revi&s;ion of the proce&s;s of Abbeville had humiliated that of Paris; and an unwi&s;e policy had re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the parliaments without taking advantage of their temporary overthrow, and the little cre|dit of tho&s;e who had replaced them, to intro|duce into the laws and tribunals an entire re|form, the nece&s;&s;ity of which was felt by all enlightened men. But an admini&s;tration which was feeble, and the enemy of reformation, did not dare or did not wi&s;h to &s;eize this occa&s;ion, in which the public good had found &s;till le&s;s ob&s;tacles than in the in&s;tance which was &s;o &s;hamefully neglected by the Chancellor Mau|peou.</P>
<P>Thus al&s;o, through complai&s;ance to the prejudices of the parliaments, mini&s;ters &s;uf|fered the advantages for the reform of edu|cation to be lo&s;t, which was offered to them by the de&s;truction of the Je&s;uits. They did not even, in 1774, take any precaution to prevent the renewal of the contentions which, in 1770, had led to the ruin of the magi&s;tracy. They had pur&s;ued but a &s;ingle object, the ad|vantage of &s;ecuring a per&s;onal gratitude, which gave to the authors of the change a means of employing a credit of the corps, who&s;e re-e&s;tabli&s;hment was their work, with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the rivals of their power.</P>
<P>Hence the only advantage which Voltaire could obtain, from the admini&s;tration of M. Turgot, was to withdraw the little country of
<PB N="176" REF="024210_0175_0FC56B2DB84EDB20">
Gex from the tyranny of the farms. Separat|ed from France by mountains, having an ea&s;y communication with Geneva and Switzerland, this unfortunate country could not be &s;ubject|ed to the revenue laws without becoming the theatre of perpetual war between the &s;ervants of the revenue and the inhabitants, nor with|out paying expences for the collection &s;till more burden&s;ome than the impo&s;ts them&s;elves. The little importance of this regulation &s;hould have rendered it ea&s;y; yet, it was long &s;oli|cited, in vain, by M. de Voltaire.</P>
<P>Part of the provinces of France have, through various cau&s;es e&s;caped the yoke of the Farm-general, or have only borne half of its weight; but the farmers-general have ince&s;&s;antly in|crea&s;ed their limits, and envelloped in their chains detached cantons which had long been protected by feudal privileges. They believed that their God Terminus, like that of the Ro|mans, ought never to recede; and that the fir&s;t &s;tep he &s;hould retreat would be the pre|&s;age of de&s;truction to the empire. Their op|po&s;ition, however, could not induce M. Tur|got to abandon a ju&s;t and beneficent operation, which without injury to the revenue, would le&s;&s;en the burden of the inhabitants, dimini&s;h the burden of crimes and oppre&s;&s;ions, and re|&s;tore pro&s;perity and peace to a di&s;trict pillag|ed by de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>The country of Gex, then, was delivered from the yoke, on condition of rai&s;ing thirty

<P>Voltaire's re&s;pect for M. Turgot would have been augmented by the edicts of 1776 had not he already known that mini&s;ter's genius, and comprehended his views. This great &s;tate&s;|man had perceived that, placed at the head of the finances at a moment in which he was em|barra&s;&s;ed by the ma&s;s of the public debt, and by ob&s;tacles which the courtiers and the fir&s;t mini&s;ter oppo&s;ed to every great reform in ad|mini&s;tration and to all important economy, he could not dimini&s;h the impo&s;ts; but he wi&s;hed, at lea&s;t, to give &s;ome con&s;olation to the people, and &s;ome indemnity to the proprietors of lands by re&s;toring to them rights of which they had been deprived by oppre&s;&s;ive regulations.</P>
<P>The remains of feudal &s;lavery which &s;pread de&s;olation through the country, which com|pelled the poor to labour without hire, and de|prived agriculture of the hu&s;bandmen's cattle, were changed into an impo&s;t, paid only by the proprietors of land. Through all the cities, ridiculous corporations obliged a part of the inhabitants to purcha&s;e the right of labouring; tho&s;e who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by commerce or their own indu&s;try were compelled to live under the va&s;|&s;alage

of a certain number of privileged peo|ple, or to pay a tribute to the&s;e bodies; this ab&s;urd in&s;titution di&s;appeared, and the right of freely employing their time and &s;trength was re&s;tored to the citizens.</P>
<P>The proprietors of grain and of wine, the fir&s;t harra&s;&s;ed by popular prejudices, the other by de&s;potic privileges, which had been extorted by particular cities, were relieved from tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions; and the&s;e wi&s;e laws could not fall to accelerate the progre&s;s of agriculture, and multiply the national wealth, by in&s;uring the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the people.</P>
<P>But the&s;e beneficent edicts were the &s;ig|nal of that mini&s;ter's fall who had the boldne&s;s to conceive them. They excited the oppo&s;ition of the parliaments who were intere&s;ted in &s;up|porting the Jurandes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The warden&s;hip of the different companies of trade&s;men.</NOTE> the fertile &s;ource of lu|crative law &s;uits, who were not le&s;s attached to the old regulations which furni&s;hed them with the means of acting on the minds of the people, who were irritated to &s;ee the burthen of mak|ing roads laid on the oppulent owners of land, and were without any hope that an unworthy conde&s;cen&s;ion would continue to lighten the weight of their individual taxes, but who were more particularly alarmed at the influ|ence which &s;eemed to be acquired by a mini&s;ter who&s;e benevolent &s;pirit menaced the over|throw of their power.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="024210_0178_0FC56B37D2CCD5F0">The intrigues of the enemies of M. Turgot were &s;trengthened by this league of the parlia|ments; and it was then perceived how &s;ervice|able to their &s;ecret and pernicious de&s;igns was the manner in which the tribunals had been re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; it was then &s;een how dangerous it is to a mini&s;ter to de&s;ign the welfare of the people; and, perhaps, were we to mount up to the cau&s;e of events, we &s;hould find that the fall even of vicious mini&s;ters has originated in the good which they wi&s;hed to do, and not in the evil which they have produced.</P>
<P>In the calamities of France, Voltaire beheld the de&s;truction of hopes which he had entertain|ed for the advancement of the human mind. He had imagined that intolerance, &s;uper&s;tition, and the mon&s;terous prejudices which infected every branch of legi&s;lation, every department of power, and all conditions of &s;ociety, would have fled before a mini&s;ter who was the friend of ju&s;tice, of liberty and rea&s;on. Such as have accu&s;ed Voltaire of ba&s;e adulation, &s;uch as have bitterly reproached him with the u&s;e which he made of prai&s;e, perhaps too fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quent|ly, to influence the minds of powered men and to compel them to be ju&s;t and humane, may compare tho&s;e prai&s;es to his eulogy of M.

the &s;oul, from the play of imagination; and they will perceive that Voltaire committed no other crime than that of treating courtiers as women: nearly the &s;ame prote&s;tations are be|&s;towed on the whole &s;ex, and it is the tone alone that di&s;tingui&s;hes the prai&s;e which is felt from that which is given to politene&s;s.</P>
<P>Voltaire, offering incen&s;e to the kings and mini&s;ters to engage them on the &s;ide of truth, and Voltaire, celebrating genious and virtue, &s;peaks not the &s;ame language. Did he wi&s;h only to flatter, he was prodigal of the charms of his brilliant imagination, he multiplied the&s;e ingenious ideas which were ever ready at his call; but did he wi&s;h to render an homage ac|knowledged by his heart, it was his &s;oul which e&s;caped him, it was his rea&s;on which &s;poke. During his vi&s;it to Paris his admiration of M. Turgot was infu&s;ed through all his di&s;cour&s;e. M. Turgot was the man whom he oppo&s;ed to all who complained of the depravity of our age; and to him his mind gave his intire approbati|on. I have &s;een him take his hands, bathe them with his tears, ki&s;s them in de&s;pight of M.

<P>Voltaire had long de&s;ired to revi&s;it his coun|try, and to enjoy his reputation in the mid&s;t of the &s;ame people who had been the witne&s;s of his fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s and too often the accomplice of his enemies. M. de Villette had lately, at
<PB N="181" REF="024210_0180_0FC56B3CC2D4B370">
Ferne, e&s;pou&s;ed Mademoi&s;elle de Varicour, a lady de&s;cended from a noble family in the coun|try of Gex, whom her relations had confided to the care of Madame Denis. Voltaire ac|companied them to Paris, partly led by the de|&s;ire of &s;eeing the repre&s;entation of the trage|dy of Irene, which he had &s;hortly before fini&s;h|ed. It had been kept a profound &s;ecret; and malice had not time to prepare her poi&s;on, nor would the public enthu&s;ia&s;m have permitted its operation. A croud of men and women of every rank and condition, from whom his ver&s;es had drawn the tears of humanity, who had &s;o fre|quently admired his genius at the theatre and in reading his works, who were indebted to him for their improvement, whole prejudices he had de&s;troyed, and to whom he had impart|ed a &s;park of that zeal again&s;t fanatici&s;m by who&s;e flame he was devoured, were eager to behold him. Jealou&s;y was &s;ilent before a glo|ry which it was impo&s;&s;ible to extingui&s;h, be|fore the benefit which he had conferred on mankind. Mini&s;ters, and proud prelates, were obliged to re&s;pect the idol of the nation. This enthu&s;ia&s;m was even &s;pread through the com|mon ranks of the people; they crowded round his windows, and pa&s;&s;ed whole hours there with the hope of &s;eeing him for one moment. His carriage, which could &s;carcely proceed along the &s;treets, was &s;urrounded by a numer|ous multitude, who ble&s;&s;ed him and celebrated his works.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="024210_0181_0FC56B4049B3AC50">The French academy, which had not adopt|ed him till the age of fifty-two, lavi&s;hed ho|nours on him, and received him rather as &s;overeign of the empire of letters than as an equal. The children of tho&s;e haughty cour|tiers, who&s;e pride had been wounded to &s;ee him live in their &s;ociety without meanne&s;s, and who had wi&s;hed to humiliate in his per&s;on the &s;uperiority of genius and talents, contend|ed for the honour of being pre&s;ented to him, and of an opportunity to boa&s;t that they had &s;een Voltaire.</P>
<P>But it was at the theatre, where he had &s;o long reigned, that he had the greate&s;t honours to expect. He went to the third repre&s;enta|tion of Irene; which was, indeed, but a fee|ble tragedy; which, however, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many beauties, and in which the wrinkles of age could not conceal the &s;acred impre&s;&s;ion of ge|nius. He alone drew the attention of a people, eager to di&s;tingui&s;h his features, to ob&s;erve his ge&s;tures, to pur&s;ue the direction of his eyes. His bu&s;t was crowned on the &s;tage in the mid&s;t of applau&s;e, cries of joy, and tears of enthu&s;i|a&s;m. To quit the theatre he mu&s;t pa&s;s through the multitude that crouded round him; feeble, &s;carce able to &s;upport him&s;elf, the guards, which were de&s;igned to protect him from the eagerne&s;s of zeal, became u&s;ele&s;&s; at his ap|proach, each retired with a re&s;pectful atten|tion, or di&s;puted the honour of &s;upporting him a moment on the &s;tares; each &s;tep offer|ed

him new aid, nor was any one permitted to arrogate too long the right of giving him a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The &s;pectators followed him to his apart|ment, and the air was filled with the cries of "Long live Voltaire! Long live the Henriade! Long live Mahomet!" numbers fell at his feet, and numbers ki&s;&s;ed his garment. Never has man been received with more intere&s;ting marks of admiration and of public affection, nor ever has genius been honoured by a more flattering homage; and this homage was addre&s;&s;ed, not to his power, but to the happine&s;s which he had conferred on man. An illu&s;trious poet would have been received only with plaudits: tears flowed before the philosopher, who had de&s;troyed the fetters of rea&s;on, and avenged the cau&s;e of humanity.</P>
<P>The &s;ublime and impa&s;&s;ioned &s;oul of Vol|taire was moved with the&s;e tributes of re&s;pect and zeal: "They wi&s;hed me to die with plea|&s;ure," he &s;aid; but it was the voice of &s;en&s;i|bility, and not the artifice of &s;elf-love. In the mid&s;t of the honours paid him by the French academy, he was particularly &s;truck by the po&s;&s;ibility of introducing into that place a more daring philo&s;ophy: "They treat me with more attention than I merit," he &s;aid to me, one day; "do you know that I do not de&s;pair of cau&s;ing the eulogium of Coligny to be &s;poken there?"</P>
<P>During the run of Irene, he was employed
<PB N="184" REF="024210_0183_0FC56B450CA175A0">
in revi&s;ing his e&s;&s;ay on the Manners and the &s;pirit of Nations; and to give, in that world &s;ome new wounds to fanatici&s;m. He had with &s;ecret plea&s;ure ob&s;erved, at the theatre, that the lines which were received with the great|e&s;t acclamations were tho&s;e in which he at|tacked &s;uper&s;tition and the names the had long rendered &s;acred; and it was to this object to a&s;cribed all the glory he had acquired. He beheld, in that general admiration, the em|pire which he had exerci&s;ed over the mind, and the de&s;truction of prejudices which he had accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>At this &s;ame time, Paris boa&s;ted, al&s;o, the pre&s;ence of the celebrated Franklin, who, in another hemi&s;phere, had been the apo&s;tle of philo&s;ophy and toleration. Like Voltaire, he had often employed the weapon of humour which corrects the ab&s;urdities of men, and had di&s;played their perver&s;ene&s;s as a folly more fatal, but al&s;o worthy of pity. He had joined to the &s;cience of metaphy&s;ics the genius of practical philo&s;ophy; as Voltaire, that of poetry. Franklin had delivered the va&s;t countries of America from the yoke of Europe; and Vol|taire had freed Europe from the yoke of the ancient theocracy of A&s;ia. Franklin was ea|ger to &s;ee a man who&s;e reputation had long been &s;pread over both worlds; Voltaire, al|though he had lo&s;t the habit of &s;peaking En|gli&s;h, endeavoured to &s;upport the conver&s;ation in that language; and, afterwards rea&s;&s;uming
<PB N="185" REF="024210_0184_0FC56B46852CB500">
the French, he &s;aid: "Je n'ai pu r&eacute;&s;i&s;ter au de&s;it de parler un moment la langue de M. Franklin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire of &s;peaking the lan|guage of Mr. Franklin for a moment.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The American philo&s;opher pre&s;ented his grand&s;on to Voltaire, with a reque&s;t that he would give him his benediction. "God and liberty!" &s;aid Voltaire: "it is the only bene|diction which can be given to the grand&s;on of Franklin." They went together to a public a&s;&s;embly of the academy of &s;ciences, and the public at the &s;ame time beheld with emotion the&s;e two men, born in different quarters of the globe, re&s;pectable by their years, their glory, the employment of their lives, and both enjoyed the influence which they had exerci&s;ed over the age in which they lived. They em|braced each other in the mid&s;t of public accla|mations, and it was &s;aid to be Solon who em|braced Sophocles. But the French Sophocles had trampled on error and advanced the reign of rea&s;on; and the Solon of Philadelphia, hav|ing placed the con&s;titution of his country on the immoveable foundation of the rights of men, had no fear of &s;eeing his uncertain laws, even during his own life, open the way to tyranny and prepare fetters for his country.</P>
<P>Age had not enfeebled the activity of Vol|taire, and the tran&s;ports with which he was received by his fellow citizens &s;eemed to renew his vigour. He formed the de&s;ign of

refuting whatever the Duke de St. Simon, in his memoirs, then unpubli&s;hed, had written under the influence of hatred and prejudice, le&s;t the&s;e memoirs, which might derive &s;ome authority from the known probity of the author and from his rank and title of cotemporary, &s;hould appear at a time in which men would be too far removed from the events of which he &s;peaks, to detect error and defend the truth.</P>
<P>He had al&s;o induced the French academy to adopt the de&s;ign of forming its dictionary on a new plan. They were to have deduced the hi&s;tory of each word from the period in which it had appeared in the language, to give the various meanings which it a&s;&s;umed in different ages, and the various acceptations it had received, and to employ, in order to di&s;play the&s;e varied &s;hades, not capricious phra&s;es, but examples &s;elected from authors of the greate&s;t authority. Then would have been &s;een the true literary and grammatical dictionary of the language, and not only fo|reigners but even Frenchmen might, in that work, have acquired a knowledge of all its delicacy.</P>
<P>This dictionary would have pre&s;ented in|&s;tructive pages to men of letters, would have contributed to form the national ta&s;te, and arre&s;ted the progre&s;s of corruption. Each ac|ademician was to have explained a letter of the alphabet. Voltaire undertook the letter A; and, to excite the indu&s;try of his brethren,
<PB N="187" REF="024210_0186_0FC56B4EF10E0778">
and to bani&s;h the difficulty of executing this plan, he was de&s;irous to fini&s;h, within a few months, that part of the work which he had a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>His &s;trength was wa&s;ted by &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive application; and he had been much reduced by a &s;pitting of blood, cau&s;ed by his efforts during the repre&s;entation of Irene. Yet, the activity of his mind &s;ubdued all; and conceal|ed from him the real weakne&s;s of his con&s;titu|tion. At length, deprived of &s;leep by an irri|tation produced by too inten&s;e labour, he wi&s;hed to procure &s;ome hours repo&s;e, that he might be in a condition to lead the academy irrevocably to engage in the new dictionary, again&s;t which &s;ome objections had ari&s;en; and he re&s;olved to take opium. His imagination po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all its vivacity, his &s;oul was equally re&s;tle&s;s and impetuous, his character abated not of its gaiety and vigour, when he took the opi|ate which he judged to be nece&s;&s;ary. During the &s;ame evening, his friends had heard him expre&s;s his dete&s;tation of prejudices with his u&s;ual eloquence; and &s;oon after beheld him viewing them only on the ridiculous &s;ide, and deriding them with that peculiar grace and aptne&s;s which characteri&s;ed his &s;allies of wit. But he took the opiate at &s;everal do&s;es, and was deceived as to the quantity, probably in the &s;pecies of intoxication which the fir&s;t had produced.

life in danger. Unhappily, this time, his wa&s;t|ed powers were unable to contend with the poi&s;on. He had long been &s;ubject to a com|plaint in the bladder, and in the general de|cay of his organs, that &s;oon contracted an in|curable di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Scarcely could he, during the long interval between this fatal accident and his death, pre|&s;erve his recollection for a few &s;ucce&s;&s;ive mo|ments, or di&s;engage him&s;elf from the lethargy in which he was plunged. To the young Count de Lalli, however, who was even then celebrated for his courage, and who has &s;ince de&s;erved celebrity by his eloquence and patri|oti&s;m, he wrote, in one of the&s;e intervals, tho&s;e lines, the la&s;t which were traced by his hand, in which he applauds the royal authority who&s;e ju&s;tice had lately annulled one of the attroci|ous acts of parliamentary de&s;poti&s;m. At length he expired on the 30th of May, 1778.</P>
<P>The arrival of Voltaire at Paris had re-kin|dled the fury of the fanatics, and wounded the pride of the chiefs of the hierarchy; but it had al&s;o in&s;pired &s;ome prie&s;ts with an idea of building their reputation and their fortune on the conver&s;ion of this illu&s;trious enemy. Cer|tainly, they could not flatter them&s;elves with the hope of &s;ubduing him, but they did not des|pair of inducing him to di&s;&s;emble. Voltaire, who wi&s;hed to remain at Paris without being tormented by &s;acerdotal accu&s;ations, and who, from a habit acquired in his youth, thought it
<PB N="189" REF="024210_0188_0FC56B51B8AD8198">
beneficial to the intere&s;ts even of the friends of rea&s;on, that certain &s;cenes of intolerance &s;hould not &s;ucceed his la&s;t moments, had &s;ent in the beginning of his malady for an almoner of the incurables, and who had boa&s;ted of having re|&s;tored to the bo&s;om of the church the Abb&eacute; de L'Attaignant, known by offences of another kind.</P>
<P>The Abb&eacute; Gauthier confe&s;&s;ed Voltaire, and received a profe&s;&s;ion of faith from him, by which he declared that he died in the catholic religi|on, in which he was born.</P>
<P>When this circum&s;tance was known, which offended enlightened men rather more than it edified the devotees, the curate of Saint Sulpice ran to his pari&s;honer, who received him with politene&s;s, and gave him according to u&s;age a hand&s;ome offering for his poor peo|ple. But, mortified that the Abb&eacute; Gauthier had anticipated him, he di&s;covered that the almoner of the incurables had been too ea&s;ily &s;ati&s;fied with his penitent, and that he ought to have required a more particular profe&s;&s;ion faith, and an expre&s;s di&s;avowal of all the doc|trines, contrary to orthodoxy, which Voltaire tad been accu&s;ed of maitaining. The Abb&eacute; Gauthiers pretended that, by requiring every thing, all would have been lo&s;t. During this di&s;pute, Voltaire recovered, Irene was play|ed, and the conver&s;ion was forgotten. But, in the moment of the relap&s;e, the curate re|turned to Voltaire, ab&s;olutely re&s;olved not to
<PB N="190" REF="024210_0189_0FC56B59EADC84D8">
inter him, if he could not obtain the de&s;ired recantation of his errors.</P>
<P>This curate was among tho&s;e men who are a mixture of hypocri&s;y and imbecility; he &s;poke with the ob&s;tinate per&s;ua&s;ion of a mani|ac, and acted with the flexibility of a je&s;uit; he was humble in his manners even to ba&s;ene&s;s, arrogant in his &s;acerdotal preten&s;ions, fawning with the great, and charitable to the populace who are governed by the prie&s;ts that di&s;tribute alms to them, and, in fine, he harra&s;&s;ed the &s;imple citizens, by his imperious fanatici&s;m. He earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to compel Voltaire at lea&s;t to acknowledge the divine nature of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; to which he was more attached than any other dogma. He, one day, drew Vol|taire from his lethargy, by &s;houting in his ear: "Do you believe the Divinity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t?" "In the name of God, &s;ir," replied Voltaire, "&s;peak to me no more of that man; but let me die in peace."</P>
<P>The prie&s;t then declared he was compelled to refu&s;e him burial; but he was not authori&s;ed in this refu&s;al; for, according to the laws, it ought to have been preceded by a &s;entence of excommunication, or a &s;ecular judgment; and even an appeal might have been made again&s;t an excommunication, as a matter of abu&s;e. Voltaire's family, by complaining to the parlia|ment, would have obtained ju&s;tice; but they feared the fanatici&s;m of that body and the ha|tred of its members to Voltaire, who had &s;o of|ten
<PB N="191" REF="024210_0190_0FC56B5AB56EA278">
combated its preten&s;ions and exerted his powers again&s;t its inju&s;tice. They did not perceive that the parliament could not, with|out di&s;grace to it&s;elf, depart from the princi|ples on which it had acted in favour of the Jan|&s;eni&s;t; they did not know that a great num|ber of the young magi&s;trates waited only for an occa&s;ion of effacing, by &s;ome &s;plendid act, the reproach of fanatici&s;m by which they were degraded, of dignifying them&s;elves, by or|daining a mark of re&s;pect to the memory of a man of genius whom they had been unfortu|nate enough to number among their enemies, and of &s;hewing that they cho&s;e rather to atone for their inju&s;tice, than to yield to any incite|ments of vengeance. The friends of Voltaire did not ob&s;erve how much power they had ac|quired by that enthu&s;ia&s;m which his name had excited; an enthu&s;ia&s;m which had gained eve|ry cla&s;s in the nation, and which no authority would venture openly to in&s;ult.</P>
<P>They cho&s;e rather to negociate with go|vernment. Daring neither to offend public opinion by gratifying the vengeance of the clergy, nor to di&s;plea&s;e the prie&s;ts by compell|ing them to obey the laws, fearing to mortify &s;acerdotal pride, &s;hould they erect a public monument to a great man who&s;e a&s;hes were ba&s;ely di&s;turbed by prie&s;ts, or &s;hould they in|demnify his memory for the lo&s;s of eccle&s;i|a&s;tic honours, to which he had &s;o little claim, by civic honours due to his genius and the &s;er|vices

be had done the nation, mini&s;ters appro|ved a propo&s;al which was made of removing Voltaire's body to the church of a mona&s;tery, of which his, nephew was abb&eacute;. It was accor|dingly conducted to Scelli&egrave;res, and the prie&s;ts agreed not to interrupt the execution of this de&s;ign. However, two ladies, of di&s;tingui&s;h|ed rank and very great devotees, wrote to the bi&s;hop of Troyes to engage him, in quality, of diocean bi&s;hop, to oppo&s;e the burial. But, fortunately for the honour of the bi&s;hop, the&s;e letters arrived too late, and Voltaire was in|terred.</P>
<P>The French academy had ob&s;erved a cu&s;tom of &s;aying ma&s;s at the church of the Cordeliers for each of their decea&s;ed members. The archbi&s;hop of Paris, Beaumont, &s;o well known by his ignorance and fanatici&s;m, prohibited the performance of the ceremony. The Corde|liers obeyed with regret; but they knew that the confe&s;&s;ors of the archbi&s;hop would pardon his &s;pirit of revenge, and would forbear to re|commend ju&s;tice to him. The academy, there|fore, re&s;olved to &s;u&s;pend the practice of this ceremony till the in&s;ult offered to the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious of its members &s;hould be repaired. Thus Beaumont became, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o de&s;pight of him|&s;elf, the in&s;trument of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing a ridiculous &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>Mean while the King of Pru&s;&s;ia commanded a &s;olemn ma&s;s to be &s;aid for Voltaire in the catholic church of Berlins and the academy of
<PB N="193" REF="024210_0192_0FC56B5F32C80FA0">
Pru&s;&s;ia was invited to attend. But that which was more glorious to Voltaire, was, that the king in the field of battle, where, at the head of an hundred and fifty thou&s;and men, he de|fended the rights of the princes of the empire, and impo&s;ed laws on the Au&s;trian power, wrote the eulogium of that illu&s;trious man, who&s;e di&s;ciple and friend he had been, and who, per|haps, had never pardoned him the unworthy and di&s;graceful violence which he had endured at Franckfort, but towards whom the monarch was ince&s;&s;antly and involuntarily led by his na|tural ta&s;te and his admiration of genius. This eulogium nobly compen&s;ated for the mean ven|geance of the prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>Of all the enormities which, in the times of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, the prie&s;ts have obtained the power of committing again&s;t hu|man nature with impunity, that which is ex|erci&s;ed on the bodies of the decea&s;ed is un|que&s;tionably the lea&s;t prejudicial; and, in the eyes of enlightened men, tho&s;e outrages can appear no other than a title of renown. Yet, re&s;pect for the remains of men who have been dear to us is no prejudice; it is an affection in&s;pired by nature her&s;elf, who has placed, in the rece&s;&s;es of our hearts, a veneration for ev|ery thing that can recal to our remembrance beings whom friend&s;hip or gratitude have ren|dered &s;acred to our feelings. The liberty of offering a &s;orrowful homage to their a&s;hes is
<PB N="194" REF="024210_0193_0FC56B64636756D8">
then a precious right to delicate minds, and the power of choo&s;ing that which their &s;en&s;a|tions &s;hall dictate, cannot, without inju&s;tice, be taken away; &s;till le&s;s may this con&s;olation be forbidden at the will of an intolerant &s;ect, who have u&s;urped, with an audacity too long endured, the right of controuling the thoughts of men, or of inflicting puni&s;hment for them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide, the empire of prejudice over the minds of the populace is not yet de&s;troyed; a Chri&s;tian deprived of burial, is &s;till in the eyes of inferior people, the object of horror and di&s;dain; and this inju&s;tice is extended even to his fami|ly. If, indeed, the hatred of prie&s;ts would pur&s;ue none but men who are immortalized by their works and who&s;e glory embraces all ages, we might pardon their de&s;picable efforts; but their hatred may be attached to victims le&s;s il|lu&s;trious; and all men have the &s;ame rights.</P>
<P>Government, in &s;ome degree a&s;hamed of its feeble conduct, hoped to e&s;cape public con|tempt by prohibiting the name of Voltaire in any writings, or in tho&s;e places where the police was accu&s;tomed to violate the freedom of &s;peech, under the pretence of pre&s;erving or|der, which it too often confounded with a re|&s;pect paid to e&s;tabli&s;hed and protected follies.</P>
<P>The public papers were forbidden to &s;peak of his death; and the comedians had orders to perform none of his pieces. Mini&s;ters did not di&s;cover that means like the&s;e, of prevent|ing the anger of the nation again&s;t their weak|ne&s;s
<PB N="195" REF="024210_0194_0FC56B68F35EFC58">
would only &s;erve more fully to provoke it; and to demon&s;trate that they had neither courage to merit the approbation nor to &s;up|port the blame of the public.</P>
<P>This &s;imple recital of the incidents of the life of Voltaire has &s;ufficiently developed his character and his mind; the principal features of which were benevolence, indulgence for hu|man foibles, and a hatred of inju&s;tice and op|pre&s;&s;ion. He may be numbered among the ve|ry few men in whom the love of humanity was a real pa&s;&s;ion; which the noble&s;t of all pa&s;&s;ions, was known only to modern times, and took ri&s;e from the proge&s;s of knowledge. Its very exi&s;tence is &s;ufficient to confound the blind parti&s;ans of antiquity, and tho&s;e who calumni|ate philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>But the happy qualities of Voltaire were oft|en perverted by his natural re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, which the writing of tragedy had but increa&s;ed. In an in&s;tant he would change from anger to affec|tion, from indignation to a je&s;t. Born with violent pa&s;&s;ions, they often hurried him too far; and his re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s deprived him of the advantages which u&s;ually accompany &s;uch minds; particularly of that fortitude to which fear is no ob&s;ticle, when action becomes a duty, and which is not &s;haken by the pre&s;ence of dan|ger fore&s;een. Often would Voltaire expo&s;e him&s;elf to the &s;torm with ra&s;hne&s;s, but rarely did he brave it with con&s;tancy; and the&s;e in|tervals, of temerity and weakne&s;s, have fre|quently
<PB N="196" REF="024210_0195_0FC56B6A7866B0B0">
afflicted his friends, and afforded un|worthy cau&s;e of triumph to his cowardly foes.</P>
<P>His affections were permanent, and his friendship for G&eacute;nonville, the pre&s;ident de Mai|&s;ons, Formont, Cideville, the Marchione&s;s du Chalelet, d'Argental, and d'Alembert, &s;eldom ob&s;cured by pa&s;&s;ing clouds, ended only with his life. From his works we di&s;cover that few men of feeling have &s;o long pre&s;erved the remembrance of friends lo&s;t in early youth.</P>
<P>He has been reproached with his numerous di&s;putes, but in none of the&s;e he was the ag|gre&s;&s;or. His enemies, tho&s;e at lea&s;t to whom he was irreconcileable, and whom he devoted to the world's contempt, did not confine them|&s;elves to per&s;onal attacks; they were his accu|&s;ers to the fanatics, and wi&s;hed to bring down the &s;word of per&s;ecution on his head. It is no doubt afflicting to be obliged to place in this li&s;t men of real merit; men like the poet Ro&s;&s;eau the two Pompignans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of them has lately, by his noble and patrio|tic conduct, effaced the &s;pots which his epi&s;copal ac|cu&s;ations had fixed upon his reputation.

It would be wrong to accu&s;e him of wilful tergiver&s;ation: nothing is more common that men who, to a worthy mind and integrity of under&s;tanding, join timidity; and dare not examine certain principles, nor think for them|&s;elves on certain &s;ubjects, till fir&s;t &s;upported by pub|lic opinion.</NOTE>, Larcher, and even Ro&s;|&s;eau

of Geneva. But it is not more excu&s;able to carry vengeance too far, in &s;elf-defence, and to be unju&s;t in the indulgence of anger, the fir&s;t motive of which is founded in rectitude, than to violate the rights of man, by endangering the freedom and &s;afety of a citizen, to gratify pride, the aims of hypocri&s;y, or an ob&s;tinate attachment to opinion?</P>
<P>Voltaire has been cen&s;ured, for his attacks on Maupertuis; but were not the&s;e attacks confined to the mere act of rendering a man eternally ridiculous, who, by ba&s;e intrigues, had endeavoured to di&s;honour and ruin him; and who, to revenge &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ts, had called the power of a king, irritated by his in&s;idious arts, to his aid?</P>
<P>Voltaire, it is &s;aid, was envious; which has been an&s;wered by the following line, from Tancred:
<Q>De qui dans l'univers peut-il etre jalou&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Does the world contain a man whom he might envy</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>Yes, he was envious of Buffon. What! could the man who&s;e mighty arm had &s;haken the antique pillars of the temple of &s;uper&s;tition, and who a&s;pired to metamorpho&s;e the vile herd which &s;o long had groaned under the &s;a|cerdotal rod into men, could be envious of the lucky and &s;plendid de&s;cription of the manners of a few animals or the more or le&s;s fortunate combination of &s;ome &s;y&s;tems, the fal&s;ity of which is proved by facts?</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="024210_0197_0FC56B74888A4398">He was envious of J. J. Rou&s;&s;eau. The bold|ne&s;s of Rou&s;&s;eau did indeed excite that of Vol|taire: but was the philo&s;opher who beheld the progre&s;s of knowledge, poli&s;hing, eman|cipating, and perfecting the human &s;pecies, and who enjoyed the revolution as his proper work, was he jealous of the eloquent writer who wi&s;hed to condemn the mind of man to eternal ignorance; Could the enemy of bi|gotry be jealous of him who, not finding &s;uffi|cient fame in the de&s;truction of its altars, vain|ly endeavoured to rebuild them?</P>
<P>Voltaire did not do ju&s;tice to the genius of Rou&s;&s;eau, becau&s;e his mind being equitable, and void of affectation, felt an involuntary re|pugnance, to exaggeration; becau&s;e a tone of au&s;terity pre&s;ented to his fancy a tincture of hypocri&s;y, the &s;malle&s;t &s;hade of which could not but di&s;gu&s;t his frank and independent &s;oul; and becau&s;e, being accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to treat all &s;ubjects with humour, gravity in the little details of pa&s;&s;ion, or of human life, always appeared to him to partake of the ridiculous. He was unju&s;t, becau&s;e Rou&s;&s;eau had angered him, by returning injury to offers of &s;ervice; had accu&s;ed him of per&s;ecution, when he was employed in his defence, and had him&s;elf di|rected the hand of per&s;ecution toward Voltaire.</P>
<P>He was jealous of Monte&s;quieu. He had cau&s;e to complain of the author of the &s;pirit of laws, who affected to treat him with indif|ference, and almo&s;t with contempt; partly
<PB N="199" REF="024210_0198_0FC56B75F811F160">
from fooli&s;h pride, and partly from timid poli|cy. Yet the celebrated &s;aying of Voltaire, that, "Humanity had lo&s;t its charms, and that Monte&s;quieu found and re&s;tored them," is the be&s;t eulogium ever pronounced on the &s;pirit of laws, and even exceeds the limits of ju&s;tice. It is only true relatively to France; &s;ince, without mentioning the works of Althu&s;ius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A German lawyer, of the XVI. century, who maintained at that time that all power originated in the people.</NOTE> and &s;ome others, the rights of man were re|claimed with more energy and candour in the works of Locke and Sidney, than in tho&s;e of Monte&s;quieu.</P>
<P>Voltaire often critici&s;ed the &s;pirit of laws, but u&s;ually with ju&s;tice. The proof that he was right, in attacking Monte&s;quieu, is that we now perceive the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and fatal prejudices finding &s;upport by quoting works of that celebrated man; which, had not the progre&s;s of knowledge at length broken the fetters forged by the dogmas of authority, concerning que&s;tions which ought only to be &s;ubmitted to the te&s;t of rea&s;on, would in the pre&s;ent day have done more mi&s;chief to France, than they had done good to Europe. The enthu&s;ia&s;tic parti&s;ans of Monte&s;quieu have af|firmed that Voltaire was incapable either of judging or of under&s;tanding his works. Irri|tated by &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions, he well might mingle

a little ill humour with ju&s;t remark; in which he would be &s;anctioned by haughtine&s;s &s;o ri|diculous.</P>
<P>The fa&s;hion of taxing Voltaire with envy was &s;o prevalent, that to this pa&s;&s;ion have been attributed his &s;age ob&s;ervations on the work of Helvetius; which, from re&s;pect to a per&s;ecuted philo&s;opher, he had the delicacy not to publi&s;h during the life of that writer. Nay, his very anger at the &s;hort lived &s;ucce&s;s of &s;ome ill wri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ten tragedies was called envy; as if anger could not be felt, except relatively to &s;elf, at &s;eeing fame u&s;urped, which is &s;o often fatal to the progre&s;s of philo&s;ophy and the arts. How much has the prai&s;e &s;o prodi|gally be&s;towed on Richelieu, Colbert, and other mini&s;ters, impeded the advancement of rea&s;on, in the &s;cience of politics!</P>
<P>While we read the works of Voltaire, we perceive no man perhaps ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed accu|racy of under&s;tanding in a Superior degree. This he pre&s;erved in the enthu&s;ia&s;m of poetry, as well as in the exuberance of humour; this was ever the guide of his ta&s;te and of his opi|nions, and is one of the principal rea&s;ons of the inexpre&s;&s;ible charms which are di&s;covered, in the peru&s;al of his works. No mind perhaps ever combined more ideas at a time, decided with more rapid &s;agacity, or di&s;played more depth, in what ever required a laborious analy|&s;is or continued meditation. The &s;trength of his eagle-eye often has a&s;toni&s;hed even tho&s;e
<PB N="201" REF="024210_0200_0FC56962F4D01C70">
who were indebted to &s;imilar means for ideas the mo&s;t profound, and combinations the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and preci&s;e. In conver&s;ation he has often been known to &s;elect the be&s;t of a mul|titude of ideas, to arrange them in the mo&s;t per&s;picacious and effectual manner, and to clothe them in the mo&s;t happy and brilliant language.</P>
<P>Hence the ine&s;timable advantage of being ever clear and unaffected without in&s;ipidity and of being read with equal plea&s;ure by the mo&s;t ignorant, as well as by the mo&s;t enlightened. Reading his works with reflexion, we find in them a multitude of profoundly philo&s;ophic and true maxims; which e&s;caped &s;uperficial readers, becau&s;e they do not enforce atten|tion, nor require any effort to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider him as a poet, we &s;hall find that, of the various &s;pecies which he attempt|ed, the ode and comedy were the only ones in which he did not de&s;erve the highe&s;t rank. He failed in comedy becau&s;e, as it has previ|ou&s;ly been remarked, he had the gift of &s;eiz|ing the ridiculous of opinion, but not of cha|racter, &s;uch as could be put in action, and which alone is proper for comedy. Not that, in a country where the mind of man &s;hould have freed it&s;elf from all its bonds, and in which philo&s;ophy &s;hould have become popular, ab&s;urd and dangerous opinions might not be &s;ucce&s;sfully exhibited on the &s;tage: but this kind of freedom is at pre&s;ent no where to be found.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="024210_0201_0FC569643868A0C8">To him poetry is indebted for the liberty of exerci&s;ing it&s;elf in a field more va&s;t.

<P>We cannot read his theatrical writings, without ob&s;erving that to him the tragic art is indebted, for the whole progre&s;s which it has made &s;ince Racine: nor can ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n tho&s;e who refu&s;e him &s;uperiority, or equality, of poetical talents, without &s;tupidiy or inju&s;tice, deny this progre&s;s. His latter tragedies prove, that he was far from &s;uppo&s;ing he had carried this &s;o difficult art to its utmo&s;t extent; he was &s;en&s;ible that tragedy might &s;till approach more nearly to nature, without being deprived of its pomp and dignity; that it &s;till addicted it&s;elf too much to local manners; that the love of women was a too frequent &s;ubject; that their pa&s;&s;ions ought to be repre&s;ented on the &s;tage as they exi&s;t in life, and their affection fir&s;t di&s;covered only by the efforts made to conceal it, and not publicly avowed, unle&s;s in tho&s;e moments when exce&s;s of danger, or of misfortune, no longer admit of di&s;gui&s;e. He thought too that characters void of affectation, great by nature, and &s;trangers to intere&s;t and ambition, might afford a &s;ource of new beau|ties, and impart to tragedy more variety and truth. But he became too feeble to execute

<P>To Voltaire we are indebted for having ta|ken a more exten&s;ive and u&s;eful view of hi&s;to|ry than the ancients. It has in his writings become, not a narrative of events, not the picture of the revolutions of a nation, but that of human nature, painted from the life, and the philo&s;ophic re&s;ult of the experience of all people, and of all ages. He fir&s;t introduced true critici&s;m into hi&s;tory; fir&s;t &s;hewed that the natural probability of accidents ought to be admitted, as proofs for or again&s;t hi&s;tori|cal authenticity; and that the philo&s;ophic hi&s;|torian ought, not only to reject miracles, but &s;crupulou&s;ly to examine the motives for cre|diting tho&s;e facts which depart from the com|mon order of nature.</P>
<P>Perhaps he may occa&s;ionally have forgotten the &s;age rule which he him&s;elf invented, and which, rigorou&s;ly adhered to, may demon&s;tate truth. Still to him we are indebted for hav|ing freed hi&s;tory from that croud of extraor|dinary incidents, adopted without proof, which,
<PB N="204" REF="024210_0203_0FC5696738F953C0">
making the greate&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the mind, blinded men to the mo&s;t natural and the be&s;t demon&s;trated facts. Before his time men knew little of hi&s;tory, except the fables by which it was disfigured. He &s;hewed that the ab&s;urdi|ties of polithei&s;m had never been the religion of any but the vulgar, among the greate&s;t na|tions; and that the belief of one God, common to all people, had no need of being revealed by &s;upernatural means. He proved that all nations have practi&s;ed the grand principles of morality, and with encrea&s;ing purity in pro|portion as they were more civilized, and bet|ter informed. He taught us that the influence of religion has often corrupted, but never im|proved morality.</P>
<P>As a philo&s;opher, he was the fir&s;t to afford an example of a private citizen, who, by his wi&s;hes and endeavours, embraced the general hi&s;tory of man in every country and in every age, oppo&s;ing error and oppre&s;&s;ion of every kind, and defending and promulgating every u&s;eful truth.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of whatever has been done in Europe, in favour of rea&s;on and humanity, is the hi&s;tory of his labours and beneficient acts. If the ab&s;urd and dangerous cu&s;tom of inter|ring the dead within the walls of cities, and even in churches, has been aboli&s;hed in &s;ome countries: if, on the continent of Europe, men, by means of innoculation, have, in part, e&s;caped a di&s;ea&s;e which threatened life, and

rea&s;on for the fir&s;t time has begun to &s;hed its clear and uniform light over all Europe; we &s;hall every where di&s;cover, in the hi&s;tory of the changes that have been effected, the name of Voltaire; and &s;hall every where find him be|ginning the battle or deciding the victory.</P>
<P>But generally obliged to conceal his inten|tions, and ma&s;k his attacks, though his works are in every hand, the principles of his philo|&s;ophy are but little known.</P>
<P>Ignorance and error are the &s;ole cau&s;e of the mi&s;ery of man; and the errors of &s;uper|&s;tition are the mo&s;t fatal, becau&s;e they corrupt every &s;ource of rea&s;on; and their de&s;tructive enthu&s;ia&s;m teaches their adherents to commit crimes without remor&s;e. That mildne&s;s of manners which is compatible with every form of government dimini&s;hes evils, the cure of which rea&s;on mu&s;t one day effect, and impedes their progre&s;s. Oppre&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, in a humane nation, a&s;&s;umes the character of the people; and is rarely guilty of great barbarity, in a country where arts, and e&s;pecially literature, are beloved. Freedom of thinking is tolerat|ed out of re&s;pect to them, though men want the fortitude to love it for its own &s;ake.</P>
<P>Our endeavours, therefore, &s;hould be to in|&s;pire the mild and con&s;olatory virtues, which lead to rea&s;on, which all men may practice, which agree with every poli&s;hed age, and which may teach hypocri&s;y it&s;elf &s;ome good. They &s;hould particularly be preferred to the&s;e au|&s;tere
<PB N="207" REF="024210_0206_0FC5696F5E987D30">
morals which &s;eldom exi&s;t, in common minds, without a mixture of unfeeling &s;everi|ty; which are to hypocri&s;y at once &s;o ea&s;y and &s;o dangerous; which often terrify tyrants, but &s;eldom con&s;ole mankind; and the nece&s;&s;ity of which proves the misfortune of tho&s;e nations who&s;e hi&s;tory they adorn.</P>
<P>By informing mankind, and by rendering them more humane, we be&s;t may hope to lead them the &s;ure&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t road to freedom. But we neither can hope to &s;pread kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wledge nor &s;often the manners of nations, if frequent wars accu&s;tom them to the &s;hedding of blood without remor&s;e, and to contemn the fame which awaits on the arts of peace; or if, oc|cupied in oppre&s;&s;ion or in &s;elf-defence, men &s;hould continue to e&s;timate their virtue by the ill they have been able to do, and imagine the art of killing to be the art of mo&s;t utility.</P>
<P>The more men are enlightened the more they will be free, and the le&s;s difficult will be the attainment of freedom. But let us not teach oppre&s;&s;ors to form a league again&s;t rea|&s;on; let us conceal from them the nece&s;&s;ary and firm union which exi&s;ts between know|ledge and liberty; and let us not too &s;oon in|form them that a nation without prejudice mu&s;t in&s;tantly be free.</P>
<P>If we except theocracies, it is the immedi|ate intere&s;t of all governments that the people &s;hould be humane and enlightened. Let us not teach them that their mo&s;t di&s;tant intere&s;t
<PB N="208" REF="024210_0207_0FC5697040A21048">
is to leave men in a &s;tate of ignorance. Let us not oblige them to choo&s;e between the in|tere&s;t of pride and that of repo&s;e and fame. To induce them to love rea&s;on, &s;he mu&s;t al|ways appear in a gentle and peaceful form; and, far from terrifying them by imprudent threats, while &s;he a&s;ks their &s;upport mu&s;t offer her own. If we attack oppre&s;&s;ors before we have taught the oppre&s;&s;ed, we &s;hall ri&s;k the lo&s;s of liberty and the death of rea&s;on. Hi&s;to|ry affords proofs of this truth. How often, in de&s;pite of the generous efforts of the friends of freedom, has a &s;ingle battle reduced nations to the &s;lavery of ages!</P>
<P>And what is the kind of liberty enjoyed by tho&s;e nations which have recovered it by force of arms, and not by the force of rea&s;on? It has been temporary freedom, and &s;o di&s;turbed by &s;torms that it remained doubtful whether it were or were not an advantage. Have not mo&s;t of them confounded the forms of repub|licani&s;m with the enjoyment of right, and the de&s;poti&s;m of numbers with freedom. How ma|ny unju&s;t laws, contrary to the rights of na|ture, have di&s;honoured the code of all nations which have recovered their liberty, during tho&s;e ages in which rea&s;on was &s;till in its child|hood!</P>
<P>Why not profit by this fatal experience, and wi&s;ely wait the progre&s;s of knowledge, in or|der to obtain freedom more effectual more &s;ub&s;tantial, and more peaceful? Why purcha&s;e
<PB N="209" REF="024210_0208_0FC56971B575F190">
it by torrents of blood, and inevitable confu|&s;ion, and give that to chance which time mu&s;t certainly and without blood&s;hed be&s;tow? In order to be more free and to be ever &s;o, we &s;hould wait the time when men, relea&s;ed from their prejudices and guided by rea&s;on, will be worthy of freedom, becau&s;e they will know what are its true claims.</P>
<P>What therefore is the duty of a philo&s;opher? To attack &s;uper&s;tition; to point out peace, wealth, and power to governments, as the in|fallible rewards of tho&s;e laws which &s;ecure re|ligious liberty; and to teach them how much they have to fear from prie&s;ts, who&s;e &s;ecret influence will ever m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ace the repo&s;e of nati|ons in which the lib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty of the pre&s;s is under the lea&s;t re&s;traint, For, previous to the in|vention of the art of printing, it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;hake off this &s;hameful and fatal yoke: and till &s;acerdotal authority &s;hall be entirely anni|hilated by rea&s;on, there will be no medium between ab&s;olute ignorance and dangerous commotion.</P>
<P>The philo&s;opher will &s;hew that, without freedom of thought, the &s;pirit of the clergy mu&s;t again produce a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, tortures, pro|&s;criptions, and civil wars; and that, by enlight|ening the people only can nations, and kings, be &s;ecured from &s;uch &s;acred crimes. He will prove that men who wi&s;h for ab&s;olute power over the mind, will employ force in&s;tead of rea&s;on, will oblige con&s;cience to cede to their

dogmas, and far from affording morality a more &s;olid ba&s;is by combining it with religi|ous notions, will corrupt and de&s;troy it; while they &s;eek not to promulgate virtue, but, to make their adherents the blind in&s;truments of their ambition and avarice.

<P>Were he to be reproached with repeating the &s;ame theme too often, and with too ob&s;ti|nately attacking errors in them&s;elves beneath contempt, he will reply&mdash;They are not con|temptible while credited by the vulgar. And, though it be le&s;s glorious to combat vulgar error than to teach new truths to &s;ages, it is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to break the bonds of rea|&s;on and to open a free road to truth, to pre|fer utility to fame.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of proving that &s;uper&s;tition is the &s;upport of de&s;poti&s;m, if he write to people un|der an arbitrary government, he will prove that it is the enemy of kings; and of the&s;e two truths he will purpo&s;ely dwell upon that which may aid the cau&s;e of humanity; and not on that by which it may be injured; becau&s;e lia|ble to be mi&s;under&s;tood.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of declaring war again&s;t de&s;poti&s;m, before rea&s;on &s;hould have a&s;&s;embled &s;ufficient powers, and calling nations to the banners of freedom, who neither love it nor under&s;tand

To &s;implify and humanize the laws, to counteract the op|pre&s;&s;ion of &s;ubordinate tyranny, to break off the &s;hackles with which fal&s;e policy may have encumbered the indu&s;try and liberty of trade, in order that freedom may be the only happi|ne&s;s wanting to mankind, and that nations worthy of freedom may be pre&s;ented to her, &s;uch will be his efforts, &s;uch his theme.</P>
<P>Such is the re&s;ult of the philo&s;ophy of Vol|taire, and &s;uch the &s;pirit which pervades his works.</P>

the elder Brutus, or in other words of Ame|rican independence, neither Monte&s;quieu nor Rou&s;&s;eau would have written as they have done; that if, like the author of the Sy&s;t&ecirc;me de la Nature, he had invited the kings of Eu|rope to &s;upport the power of the prie&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tran&s;lator &s;peaks from memory, but he be|lieves himself ju&s;tified in &s;aying that this accu&s;ation of the author of the Sy&s;t&ecirc;me de la Nature is fal&s;e, who&s;e doctrine, if he does not gro&s;sly mi&s;take, was, that the de&s;potic power of the kings and prie&s;ts was founded in reciprocal &s;upport, and that de&s;poti&s;m of every kind was equally hateful and de&s;tructive.</NOTE>, Europe would &s;till have been &s;uper&s;titious, and would long have remained in bondages; and let them forget that in books, as in beha|viour, we ought to di&s;play the courage only which the occa&s;ion requires; their inju&s;tice will but little injure the glory of Voltaire. Men of genius mu&s;t be his judges, men who can di&s;cover, in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of various works, as well from their form and &s;tyle as from their principles, the &s;ecret plan of a philo&s;opher, who in waging continual but bold and artful war on prejudice; rather intent on conque&s;t than renown; too great to be vain of his opi|nions, and too much the friend of the human race not to make their utility the grand ob|ject of his pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>Voltaire has been accu&s;ed of partiality to monarchical government, but this accu&s;ation only can impo&s;e on &s;uch as have not read his

works. It is true he hated, beyond even mo|narchical power, ari&s;tocratic de&s;poti&s;m, which unites rigour to hypocri&s;y and tyranny more au&s;tere to morals more perver&s;e; nor was he ever the dupe of the parliaments of France, or the nobles of Sweden and Poland, who give the name of freedom to the chains with which they would load their va&s;&s;als. In this opinion, Voltaire has been joined by all philo&s;ophers who have &s;ought the definition of a free &s;tate in the nature and mind of man, and not, like the pedant Mably, in examples, drawn from the tyrannical anarchies of Italy and Greece.</P>
<P>He has been blamed for having be&s;towed too much prai&s;e on the pomp of the court of Louis XIV. and accu&s;ation was in this in&s;tance well founded; it was the only prejudice of his youth which he never &s;hook off, and there are few men who can hope they have vanqui&s;hed all their errors. It has been a&s;&s;erted, that he &s;uppo&s;ed celebrated arti&s;ts, orators, and poets, were all that were nece&s;&s;ary to render a peo|ple happy, but never could he entertain &s;uch a thought. He &s;uppo&s;ed indeed, that arts and literature poli&s;hed the manners of men, and made the road of rea&s;on &s;mooth and &s;afe, and that the love of them rendered tho&s;e who governed beneficent of heart, often prevented them from committing acts of violence and in|ju&s;tice, and that, under equal circum&s;tances, the mo&s;t ingenious and poli&s;hed people would always be the lea&s;t wretched.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="024210_0213_0FC5697D313EDF60">His pious enemies have taxed him with hat|ing a&s;&s;aulted, by wilful mi&s;quotation, the re|ligion of his country, and extending incredu|lity even to athei&s;m; both of which charges are equally fal&s;e. Among a multitude of ob|jections, founded on proofs and on pa&s;&s;ages cited from books, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been in|&s;pired by God him&s;elf, a very &s;mall number of errors only can be di&s;covered; and tho&s;e cannot be imputed to him as wilful mi&s;takes, becau&s;e, comparing them to the numerous accurate quotations and facts related with pre|ci&s;ion, it is evident that nothing could have been of le&s;s u&s;e to his cau&s;e. When contend|ing with his adver&s;aries, his maxim continual|ly was, nothing ought to be credited which is not proved, and every thing &s;hould be re|jected which is offen&s;ive to rea&s;on and proba|bility; and the an&s;wer he has continually re|ceived was, whatever cannot be demon&s;trated an impo&s;&s;ibility ought to be adopted and adored.</P>
<P>He con&s;tantly appeared to be per&s;uaded of the exi&s;tance of a Supreme Being, but with|out remaining blind to the &s;trength of the ob|jections oppo&s;ed to that opinion. While he thought he beheld the regular order of nature, he could not but perceive tho&s;e &s;triking irre|gularities which he was unable to explain.</P>

<P>He believed as much of free will as a ra|tional man can believe; that is, he believed man has the power to re&s;i&s;t inclination, and to weigh the motives of action.</P>
<P>His incertitude re&s;pecting &s;pirit was almo&s;t ab&s;olute, and even concerning the exi&s;tence of the &s;oul after the decea&s;e of the body; but as he imagined this opinion, as well as that of the exi&s;tance of a God, was beneficial, he rarely allowed him&s;elf to mention his doubts, and generally dwelt rather on the proofs than on the objections.</P>
<P>Such was the philo&s;ophy of Voltaire; and we, perhaps, &s;hall find, while we read his life, that he has been more admired than known; that though gaul abounds in &s;ome few of his polemical writings, his predominant &s;en&s;ation was active benevolence; that his affection for the unfortunate exceeded his hatred of his enemies; and that the pa&s;&s;ion of fame in him was ever &s;ubordinate to the more noble love of humanity. Superior to the o&s;tentation of vir|tue, or to the concealment of his foibles, which he would &s;ometimes candidly confe&s;s, though not proudly proclaim, few men ever exi&s;ted who&s;e lives have been more honoured by acts

<P>WE have here &s;ubjoined &s;everal Letters, which will better &s;erve to di&s;play the character of M. de Voltaire, and that of hit enemies.</P>
<P>A tribute of admiration paid, by a prince of the blood, to a young man who&s;e rank in life placed him at a di&s;tance from that per&s;onage, and who&s;e &s;ame had not then le&s;&s;ened the di&s;tance between them, has appeared to us to merit pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The Note &s;ent by the celebrated Le Kain cannot fail to intere&s;t men of letters; in it, that great actor ingenuou&s;ly paints Voltaire's enthu|&s;ia&s;m for the dramatic art, and for the talent of acting; and, at the &s;ame time, the zeal with which he endeavoured, notwith&s;tanding his love of the art, and his de&s;ire to find actors worthy of his pieces, to di&s;&s;uade that young man from the pur&s;uit of a profe&s;&s;ion too much degraded by prejudice, while he added to his advice the means of entering into &s;ome other &s;ituation. This anecdote is one of tho&s;e which prove that benevolence was the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of Voltaire's &s;oul.</P>
<P>Thus, with &s;till greater intere&s;tedne&s;s, he prevailed on Mademoi|&s;elle Clairon, in 1765, to renounce the &s;tage; although the powers of this &s;ublime actre&s;s were in all their vigour, and became daily more nece&s;&s;ary to the poet, who&s;e dramatic genius began to decline by age and inten&s;e application.</P>
<P>His coun&s;els to D'Alembert and Diderot, when they were per&s;e|cuted for publi&s;hing the Encyclopedia, and many circum&s;tances of the &s;ame nature, will further prove that the love of ju&s;tice ro&s;e, in his mind, &s;uperior to every other con&s;ideration.</P>

For this purpo&s;e, he invited to his court all tho&s;e who&s;e good ta&s;te and delicacy could contribute to the pom|pous &s;pectacle, which he was preparing for his mi&s;|tre&s;s.

The day at length arrived, when the whole a&s;&s;embly of wits hoped to obtain the high renown which public applau&s;e had to be&s;tow While all were thus bu&s;ied in contention, Racine and Cor|neille &s;at tranquilly in the Ely&s;ian groves, recalling to mind the hi&s;tory of times pa&s;t, when they were the living ornaments of France. From gho&s;ts newly arrived they had heard of the fatal decay of poetry, in France; and that the auditors of Melpomene, dif|ficult to plea&s;e, had, &s;ince their decea&s;e, found no|thing worthy of the &s;tage. Their grief at this intel|ligence was extreme; they knew how much their countrymen were delighted with the plea&s;ures the theatre can be&s;tow; and that, for&s;aken by the mu&s;e poets no longer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e noble flights which &s;o much grace the &s;cene. Since their de&s;cent to the&s;e abodes, they had become acquainted with a &s;pirit, inexperienced, but who&s;e active and graceful wit sur|pa&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t aged in genius and in &s;cience. To repair the wrongs of the &s;uffering &s;tage, they cho&s;e this &s;pirit, prevailed on him to a&s;&s;ume a human form, and, having in&s;tructed him perfectly in their art, &s;ent him to the banks of the Seine, where he took the name of Arouet.

<HEAD>LETTER FROM THE ABBE DESFONTAINES, TO M. DE VOLTAIRE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>May 31, 1724.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL never forget, &s;ir, the infinite obli|gations I owe to you. The goodne&s;s of your heart is &s;uperior even to your under&s;tanding; and you are the true&s;t of friends. The zeal with which you have &s;erved me does me, indeed, more honour, than malice and ba&s;ene&s;s of my enemies does me inju&s;tice, by the unworthy treatment which they have brought upon me. It is nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould not publicly ap|pear for &s;ome time. Fallax infamia terret.</P>
<P>I have received a letter de cachet which ex|iles me to the di&s;tance of thirty leagues from Paris. I depart with plea&s;ure in &s;earch of &s;o|litude; but I am much mortified that this re|treat &s;hould be enjoined me. It is &s;ome degree of triumph for the wretched authors of my di&s;|grace. I am exceedingly willing to go into the country; but endeavour, &s;ir, to procure the king's order to be &s;uperceded by another letter de cachet, in this form:</P>
<P>The King, informed of the fal&s;ehood of the accu&s;ation brought again&s;t the Sieur Abb&eacute; Des|fotaines, con&s;ents that he &s;hould remain at Paris.</P>
<P>Should you obtain this order from M. de Maurepas, it would be an e&s;&s;ential point;

and I promi&s;e M. de Maurepas, on my honour, to depart immediately, and not to return to Paris, till I &s;hall have demanded &s;ecret permi&s;|&s;ion of him.</P>
<P>This, my dear friend, is what, at pre&s;ent, I have to beg you to obtain for me. You will confer yet another infinite obligation on me, by this new &s;ervice. It is, in my mind, the &s;imple&s;t means that can be taken to repair the &s;candal and inju&s;tice which I have endured, till I can do better, and can procure the nece&s;|&s;ary information to di&s;cover the hidden &s;prings of the horrible intrigue of my enemies. Not|with&s;tanding the atrocious nature of the accu|&s;ation, and the readine&s;s of the public to believe the accu&s;ed guilty, I have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing tho&s;e who are even unknown to me take my part. Such men as Nadal, Danchet, de Pons, and Fr&eacute;ret, are the only per&s;ons, I am told, who treat my name as, through my life, I &s;hall treat their infamous work and their un|worthy characters. Genus irritabile vatum.</P>
<P>I have formed a plan for my defence, which will be excellent and curious, and I &s;hall fini&s;h it in the country. I am too publicly known to remain &s;ilent after &s;uch an execrable in&s;ult, and I &s;hall compo&s;e my apology in &s;uch a man|ner that I &s;hall have the honour of pre&s;enting it to M. de Maurepas, and &s;hall be&s;eech him to permit its publication.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Belleville, <DATE>May 2, 1739</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I RETURN you, &s;ir, the manu&s;cript which you did me the honour to confide to me. You
<PB N="235" REF="024210_0234_0FC569AE708F36A0">
will probably imagine that I have read it with plea&s;ure, and you are not mi&s;taken; but &s;hould you conclude that I felt my&s;elf &s;atisfied when I had fini&s;hed, you will be deceived. Charm|ed with what I have already &s;een, I have but the more &s;en&s;ibly felt the ab&s;ence of the re|mainder; and to the plea&s;ure of peru&s;ing the work has &s;ucceeded con&s;iderable anger again&s;t the author.</P>
<P>Your indifference, &s;ir, or to &s;peak more frank|ly, your indolence, mu&s;t make all tho&s;e who know of what you are capable, as angry as my&s;elf. If you are &s;o indifferent to &s;ame as to contemn the reputation which mu&s;t re&s;ult from the perfection of this work, the ju&s;tice the public have done you with re&s;pect to what you have already imparted to them, calls on you to give them the remainder, which they expect with impatience. No one has a&s;cended with more truth, or more penetration to the fountain head, nor has any one treated this &s;ubject with greater delicacy and preci&s;ion. I &s;hall excite all your friends to importune you have made the work complete. At the head of the&s;e I &s;hall place the Counte&s;s, to who&s;e lips the Graces have imparted a gift of per&s;ua|&s;ion; after which it will be &s;een whether we &s;hall leave you indolent, and at your ea&s;e, for &s;ome time to come.</P>
<P>You did me ju&s;tice, &s;ir, when you a&s;&s;erted that I had no connexion with the author of the Voltairomanic, whoever he may be; and I
<PB N="236" REF="024210_0235_0FC569B2B10CC728">
further now declare to you that I have never read the piece entirely through. I merely glanced over it, becau&s;e I was informed the author had cited are relative to M. de Voltaire; a circum&s;tance which I could not hear without indignation. I would gladly know by what authority M. de Voltaire's name and mine are brought in que&s;tion, &s;ince neither the one nor the other are to be found in the work of mine which is quoted by them. They go further: would you &s;uppo&s;e it, &s;ir? They have inter|preted what I meant to &s;ay. The deification, of which they &s;peak, is merely a work of ima|gination, a chain of fictions, the links of which are connexed to form a whole. The de&s;ign in this was to point out in general the defects into which the learned fall, in various &s;cien|ces and various nations. The author has, there|fore, in this work, been obliged to imagine circum&s;tances, which, although related as cha|racteri&s;tically per&s;onal, &s;hould be regarded merely as general &s;atire, applicable to all the learned who may be guilty of &s;imilar errors. It is not po&s;&s;ible to write an allegory, or draw a character, which the imagination of the reader cannot apply to &s;ome one; whom perhaps the author has not even known. Thus, he who, in a work of invention, &s;hall have had only a general object, &s;hall be made to allude to an individual, by the malignity of fal&s;e interpre|tation. If this be permitted, we mu&s;t no long|er think of writing; at lea&s;t till the publick, be|coming

more re&s;erved, judge of the intention of the author in conformity with the general de&s;ign of his work; and till they forbear to cau&s;e the malignity of interpretation to recoil upon the writer whom they interpret.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw in what manner the writer of the Voltairomaine had decided on my inten|tion, I own to you, &s;ir, that I was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed how he, who is &s;aid to be the author of it, can be thus totally unmindful of all de|corum. My &s;urpri&s;e equalled my indignation and his temerity, not to u&s;e a har&s;her term. It is true that from the nature of the work, there is nothing which we might not be led to ex|pect.</P>
<P>I am informed that M. de Voltaire &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed this book as not to a&s;wer it. He did perfectly right. Abortion is the de&s;tiny of &s;uch writings; which can only exi&s;t by being the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation. M. de Voltaire has more valuable employment. Cultivating at pre&s;ent the Mu&s;as &s;everiores, they have taught him to ri&s;e into tho&s;e tranquil regions to which the vapours of the earth do not ex|tend: Sapientum templa &s;erena.</P>
<P>Here, &s;ir, are the two madrigals of M. de Big<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icourt, which I could not perfectly repeat to you the la&s;t time I had the honour of &s;ee|ing you in Paris.</P>

<P>THIS Abb&eacute; Desfontains is a vile man, &s;ir; his ingratitude certainly &s;urpa&s;&s;es the crimes by which he gave you an opportunity of obliging

him. Fear not but that the people in power will be your partizans. I one day happened, at the table of the cardinal, to affirm that he was the rector of a good living in Normandy, by which I offended all pre&s;ent. His eminence made me repeat three times what I had &s;aid, and I &s;hould have lo&s;t the e&s;teem of the world, and have ruined my fortune, had not the Pr&eacute;|v&ocirc;t des Marchands bore witne&s;s to the fact. The chancellor thinks as I do relative to this *** of the police; and M. Herault ought to be of the &s;ame opinion, or he will render him|&s;elf accountable to tho&s;e whom he may con|demn. The chancellor thinks well of your works, which he has often mentioned to me during our walks at Fre&s;ne. But of all your knights, my brother is mo&s;t angry with your enemy. I went to him after the receipt of your letter, and he told me that, in conformi|ty to the chancellor's orders, the Abb&eacute; Desfon|tains would be &s;ummoned to declare, whether the libels in que&s;tion were written by him; and, if not freely, would be obliged to &s;ign the af|firmative or the negative. Be a&s;&s;ured the bu|&s;ine&s;s will be properly conducted. I will &s;hort|ly &s;olicit the chancellor in per&s;on.</P>
<P>I embrace your cau&s;e with adour and &s;atis|faction, which is but ju&s;t. I have continually known you the enemy of &s;candal; you are an|gry with knaves, and laugh at fools. I mean to imitate your example to the be&s;t of my abi|lity; and yet I think my&s;elf an hone&s;t man.
<PB N="240" REF="024210_0239_0FC569BD63D81620">
This is no more than having an opinion; to impart &s;uch an opinion to our friends is detrac|tion, which religion, good &s;en&s;e, and even in|&s;tinct forbid. You have always appeared to me far from having any &s;uch evil propen&s;ity, and I am confirmed in this &s;uppo&s;ition by your acknowledged works, which are worthy of your&s;elf. Continue to write without fear for five and twenty years longer; but write poe|try, notwith&s;tanding your oath in the preface to Newton. With whatever clearne&s;s, beau|ty, and dignity, you may have under&s;tood and explained the philo&s;ophic &s;y&s;tem of this En|gli&s;hman, do not therefore de&s;pi&s;e poetical e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;tles, poems, and tragedies. We &s;hall al|ways obtain &s;cientific food, but we &s;hall &s;oon have a dearth of works of wit, and no longer will go to the theatre from the want of good authors in ver&s;e and pro&s;e.</P>

and was informed that you were at court. You would, without doubt, have been &s;urpri&s;ed at my vi&s;it, but the motive by which it was occa&s;i|oned would have &s;urpri&s;ed you &s;till more. Ne|verthele&s;s, I a&s;&s;umed courage from the reflect|ions which naturally ari&s;e in a mind of the fir&s;t order, and I &s;aid to my&s;elf: It is true that, &s;ince the year 1725, I have &s;carce ever had the honour of &s;eeing M. de Voltaire, but he will re|collect that he walks in a &s;phere which does not permit every one to approach him; and he cannot be ignorant of the admiration of him which I have ever avowed, nor can he doubt the avowal without doing inju&s;tice to my di&s;|cernment. No one at pre&s;ent has it more in his power to render him ju&s;tice than my&s;elf, from the opportunity which I had during a year of ob&s;erving him in tho&s;e &s;ocieties in which the mind and the heart may di&s;cover their true feelings without danger; and thence I have formed an opinion of him, which per&s;uades me that it is a plea&s;ure to him to confer obliga|tions.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments, &s;ir, led me to your hou&s;e to beg the favour of you to lend me ten pi&s;|toles, for which I have an immediate occa&s;ion; and to offer you, for payment, an authority to receive the &s;um from the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rears of a rent which was left me by a lady of your acquain|tance, and who has been dead &s;ome years pa&s;t.

<P>YOU know that I am indebted, for the obligation of being introduced to M. de Vol|taire,
<PB N="243" REF="024210_0242_0FC569C1328D8B28">
to a magi&s;trate who is his friend, and who is di&s;tingui&s;hed by his virtue and his me|rit. I have long wi&s;hed to bring my bu&s;ine&s;s into repute by the works of a man whom I then knew only by the powers of his mind, and who has &s;ince &s;o &s;trongly attached me to him by the qualities of his heart. My youth, my good di&s;po&s;ition, and my &s;incerity, titles to his favour which are ever &s;ucce&s;sful, completed that recommendation had commenced. Since that time, his confidence has rendered me the in&s;trument of &s;o many acts of genero&s;ity, that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> well in ju&s;tice to him as in gratitude to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">riends whom I particularly regret, I think it my duty to render an authentic te&s;timony of all my tran&s;actions relative to M. de Voltaire, and to an&s;wer the unju&s;t accu&s;ation of the li|ble entitled The Voltairomanie, which all worthy people behold with indignation.</P>
<P>The following is the hi&s;tory of M. de Vol|taire's works &s;ince I knew him, and which I am enable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o prove by authentic documents.</P>
<P>I began by printing the Henriade with con|&s;iderable corrections, the profits of which M. de Voltaire pre&s;ented to a young man who&s;e talents had made him his friend; and to whom he al&s;o gave his tragedy of the Death of Ce&s;ar. At the &s;ame time he gave the liberty of re|printing Za<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re to another book&s;eller, who&s;e copy-right in that work had expired. He gave to me his tragedies of Oedipus, Mariamne, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rutus, for my own emolument. I al&s;o pub|li&s;hed
<PB N="244" REF="024210_0243_0FC569C59EA2A2D8">
the Prodigal Son; the per&s;on who was charged to treat with me for it demanded &s;o rea&s;onable a price, that, far from having any di&s;agreement. I gave him a hundred fran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s more than the price he had demanded. Some days after M. de Voltaire informed me in a letter that he never required money for his productions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is to &s;ay, for him&s;elf.</NOTE>, but books only. In fine, he made a pre&s;ent of his Element of Newton to his Dutch book&s;ellers. Shortly after an edi|tion was printed which was called the London edition, and I knew that the book&s;eller, who began it unknown to Voltaire, thought, never|thele&s;s, that it was an attention due to M. de Voltaire to communicate the de&s;ign to him and to &s;ubmit it to his corrections before it was publi&s;hed. The edition being ready to ap|pear, M. de Voltaire bought a hundred and fifty copies to pre&s;ent to his friends at Paris, which co&s;t him, including the binding, nearly a hundred pi&s;toles.</P>
<P>This, madam, is the account of the profit which M. de Voltaire has drawn from his works; or rather it is the means of confound|ing his calumniator; and you will perceive what credit ought to be given to the impo&s;tures of which his works is an entire ti&s;&s;ue.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER FROM THE ABBE PREVOST, TO M. DE VOLTAIRE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>January 15, 1740.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM extremely de&s;irous, &s;ir, of becoming &s;ome way u&s;eful to you; this is an old &s;enti|ment which I have often expre&s;&s;ed in my pub|lications, which I have communicated to M. Thiriot on more than one occa&s;ion, and which I feel very forcibly renewed &s;ince the affair of Prault. I cannot endure that a multitude of in&s;ignificant people, embittering their minds again&s;t &s;uch a character, &s;hould, &s;ome of them from pure malignity, others from a fal&s;e air of probity and ju&s;tice, exert them&s;elves to com|municate the poi&s;on of their heart to more worthy people.</P>
<P>It has occurred to me that the public ta&s;te, which has been hitherto &s;ufficiently uniform in its partiality to my writings, would render me more likely than any other man to do you &s;ome &s;ervice. My admiration of your talents, and the particular attachment I profe&s;s to your per|&s;on,
<PB N="248" REF="024210_0247_0FC569D368DEC4C0">
would alone urge me to this object with much zeal: but my own intere&s;t is connected with my wi&s;hes, and if I may in &s;ome mea&s;ure add to your reputation you may at the &s;ame time be &s;erviceable to my fortune.</P>
<P>Here follow two points, &s;ir, which demand a little explanation; but it &s;hall be &s;hort; for I have only to lay the propo&s;ition before you.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t I have thought that A defence of M. de Voltaire and his works, written with care, energy, and &s;implicity, &amp;c. might be a valua|ble work, and might perhaps once for all &s;i|lence malignity. I &s;hould divide it into two parts; one of which would re&s;pect his per&s;on, and the other his productions. Tho&s;e advan|tages which the habit of writing may have added to &s;uch abilities as I po&s;&s;e&s;s I will em|ploy. The work &s;hould be publi&s;hed before the end of winter.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The derangement of my affairs is &s;uch that if Heaven or &s;ome one in&s;pired by Hea|ven, does not enable me to &s;ettle them, I &s;hall &s;oon depart for England. I &s;hould not com|plain of my &s;ituation, had it originated in my ill conduct; but, though I have been five years in France, with as many friends as there are worthy people in Paris, and with the protecti|on of a prince of the blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Prince de Conti.</NOTE> who entertains me in his own hou&s;e, I am yet without a be|nefice
<PB N="249" REF="024210_0248_0FC569D51C873130">
of five &s;ons. I owe about a hundred and fifty louis d'ors; for which my creditors, uniting together, have made me give my per|&s;onal &s;ecurity; and &s;o urgent is my nece&s;&s;ity, that, having agreed to di&s;charge my debts at a time which expires on the fir&s;t of the en&s;uing month, I am threatened with an arre&s;t if I am not punctual. Of a thou&s;and opulent per&s;ons with whom I pa&s;s my life, I know not one of whom I can venture to demand this &s;um, or who I think would advance it for me.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is, would M. de Voltaire, part|ly engaged by his genero&s;ity and by his zeal for men of letters, partly by my de&s;ign to em|ploy my&s;elf in his &s;ervice, be willing to deli|ver me from the mo&s;t cruel embarra&s;&s;ment which I have ever experienced? The under|taking is worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im; be&s;ide that the no|velty alone of &s;ettling the affairs of a man to whom the protection of a prince of the blood, and I may add the friend&s;hip of all Paris, is in|effectual, appears to me a &s;ingular induce|ment.</P>
<P>I have two ways of repaying the obligation. The fir&s;t, by a grateful &s;en&s;e of the favour; and I &s;hall be reduced to that if death &s;urpri|&s;es me, for I do not po&s;&s;e&s;s a revenue of a &s;in|gle &s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One Penny.</NOTE>; but I am not advanced in years, and I enjoy a &s;tate of health which promi&s;es me long life. The other mode is, to give &s;ecuri|ty
<PB N="250" REF="024210_0249_0FC569D991252900">

<HEAD>REPORT, Made to the Academy of Sciences by Me&s;&s;rs. Pitot and Clairaut, April 26, 1741, relative to the memorial of M. de Voltaire, concerning Living Force.</HEAD>
<P>WE have examined by order of the aca|demy, the memorial of M. de Voltaire, enti|tled, Doubts on the mea&s;ure and the nature of
<PB N="251" REF="024210_0250_0FC569DB05FFB888">
moving Forces. The memorial contains two parts. The fir&s;t part is an abridged recital of the principal rea&s;ons which have been ad|duced, to prove that the forces of bodies in motion are as the quantities of motion, that is, as the ma&s;s multiplied by the &s;imple velocity, and not by the &s;quare of the velocity; as tho&s;e pretend who adopt the theory of Vis viva, or living force. The rea&s;ons &s;tated by M. de Voltaire are not given as demon&s;trations, but propo&s;ed as doubts: they, however, are the doubts of a well informed man, and greatly re&s;emble deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not enter into the examination of this fir&s;t part, becau&s;e the intention of the au|thor &s;eems only to have been to recite the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons which have been given again&s;t living forces, in a manner &s;ufficiently brief and clear, &s;o as to be recollected by the read+er with facility.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd part, M de Voltaire con&s;iders the nature of force. As he has concluded that moving force is only the produce of the ma&s;s multiplied by the velocity, he admits of no di&s;tinction between the vis mortua, or dead force, and the vis viva, or living force. When it is &s;aid that the force of a body in motion differs infinitely from that of a body at re&s;t, this, according to him, is equal to &s;aying that liquid is infinitely more liquid when it runs than when it does not.</P>
<P>He next &s;tates that, if force be nothing
<PB N="252" REF="024210_0251_0FC569DC369BBC80">
more than the produce of the ma&s;s multiplied by the velocity, it is nothing more than the body it&s;elf acting, or ready to act. Thus he rejects the opinion of the philo&s;phers, who have imagined that force was a di&s;tinct being, a &s;ub&s;tance animating and &s;eparate from bo|dies; that force ought to be &s;ought for in the &s;imple beings called monades, &amp;c.</P>
<P>M. de Voltaire having remarked, as many other per&s;ons have previou&s;ly done, that in various ca&s;es the quantity of motion augments, and remaining convinced that force is merely the quantity of motion, he a&s;ks whether tho&s;e philo&s;ophers who have maintained the &s;y&s;tem of the pre&s;ervation of an equal quantity of force, in nature, are not as far from the truth as tho&s;e who &s;hould maintain the pre&s;ervation of an equal quantity of &s;pecies, individuals, forms, &amp;c.</P>
<P>He next a&s;ks, by referring to the circum|&s;tance, that an ela&s;tic body &s;triking on ano|ther more large, does then communicate a greater quantity of motion, and con&s;equently according to him more force than it previou&s;ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, whether it be not evidently deduci|ble that bodies do not communicate force; &s;o that, the ma&s;s and the motion being in&s;uffici|ent for the communication of motion, the vis inertia would be likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, without which matter would make no re&s;i&s;tance, and there would be no action.</P>
<P>M. de Voltaire further &s;uppo&s;es, that the vis inertia, the ma&s;s, and the motion, are not
<PB N="253" REF="024210_0252_0FC569E0622B5C38">
&s;ufficient. He thinks there mu&s;t be a princi|ple which keeps all bodies in motion, and in|ce&s;&s;antly communicates to them an acting force, or a force ready to act; which principle, ac|cording to him, &s;hould be gravity; whether gravity have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r have not a mechanical cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Neither ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> gravity, continues he, account for all the effects of nature. It is very far from explaining the force of organized bodies, which mu&s;t have an internal principle, like that of ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>M. de Voltaire concludes his memorial by &s;aying, that &s;ince the active force of ela&s;ticity produces the &s;ame effects as force of any other kind, it may be concluded that nature, which often attains different ends by the &s;ame means; may al&s;o attain one end by various means; and that therefore true philo&s;ophy con&s;i&s;ts in recording the operations of nature, previous to &s;ubjecting the whole to any general law.</P>
<P>Of the various que&s;tions, difficult to re&s;olve, which the two parts of this memorial contain, it appears that M. de Voltaire is well acquaint|ed with what relates to experimental philo&s;o|phy; and that he has him&s;elf well con&s;idered &s;uch &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>IT is, &s;ir, a long while &s;ince you heard from me; and it is very mortifying that I am com|pelled to call your attention to me by a hi&s;to|ry of my misfortunes. Yet I too well know the &s;entiments of your heart to yield to my fears. My father is &s;till living; he is eighty years old, and is extremely feeble. At his death I &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s more than a hundred thou|&s;and francs; but I have not received a crown. My profe&s;&s;ion abounds with difficulties; and, to pur&s;ue it, a&s;&s;i&s;tance is required, on which I have relied, and which has failed me. I have been afflicted with long and &s;evere &s;ickne&s;s, and though at length I regained my health, my practice had declined. I afterwards formed an acquaintance with a rich devotee; and, having incurred much expence in dre&s;s to enable me to appear &s;uitably at her table, &s;he barbarou&s;|ly forbade me the hou&s;e. At la&s;t, &s;ir, the poor M. de Fimar&ccedil;on applied to me for a&s;&s;i&s;tance and coun&s;el, and as I thought his affairs pro|mi&s;ing I dedicated my whole time and labour to the pro&s;ecution of his &s;uit. My illne&s;s had deprived me of half my bu&s;ine&s;s, and I lo&s;t the
<PB N="255" REF="024210_0254_0FC569E6075BED28">
remainder by giving my whole time to M. de Firmar&ccedil;on.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf that I &s;hould acquire honour by extricating him from that affair, and that his gratitude would &s;ufficiently indemnify me. Every thing has been un&s;ucce&s;sful, &s;ir. Mean while I was three months in &s;earch of a hou&s;e; on the twenty-third of December I hired one, and &s;ince that time the workmen have been employed in preparing it for my reception; &s;o that &s;ix months have pa&s;&s;ed in which I have been without a hou&s;e, without chambers, and con&s;equently without employment.</P>
<P>Judge, &s;ir, of my &s;ituation. I could not procure a crown from my father. He who has been inflexible during his whole life, does not become feeling at the age of eighty. M. Do|dun, the old receiver-general, of whom I have hired my hou&s;e in the I&s;le<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A part of Paris.</NOTE>, has made me wait, but he has expended four thou&s;and francs to make the hou&s;e commodious for me, which will be to my advantage. I have &s;ome furniture which, were they on the &s;pot, would &s;erve my purpo&s;e. I have not therefore, &s;ir, any pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion for more money than will enable me to remove my furniture to the place which of cour&s;e is an object of importance, to pay &s;ome trifling debts which I have contracted in the cour&s;e of &s;ix months, and to leave me a &s;mall &s;um with which I may open my chambers,
<PB N="256" REF="024210_0255_0FC569E9E66F7270">
and &s;ub&s;i&s;t till I &s;hall fall into practice, which I cannot fail to do.</P>
<P>I have frequently heard, &s;ir, that the unfor|tunate are permitted to boa&s;t a little. Claim|ing this privilege, to which my &s;ituation has given me too clear a title, I may declare that I do not fear any advocate who is at pre&s;ent at the bar. If I find a&s;&s;i&s;tance I &s;hall &s;oon reco|ver my lo&s;&s;es, and my chambers will have their u&s;e; in the cour&s;e of a year my practice will probably be con&s;iderable; and my father mu&s;t, in the end, leave me the property which he cannot carry away with him. But &s;hould I not procure any aid, my hou&s;e will become u&s;e|le&s;s; I &s;hall be no longer able to appear at the courts; and I &s;hall be inevitably ruined; for I have no talents for any other employment. I will give you all the &s;ecurity in my power; my wife and I will engage jointly and &s;eparately for the debt; or I will even give bills of exchange for it, provided &s;ufficient time is granted me for the payment.</P>
<P>Will you abandon me, &s;ir, and forget your long friend&s;hip for me? I am one of your olde&s;t parti&s;ans; and the defender of Oedipus ought not to peri&s;h for want in the mid&s;t of the faire&s;t hopes; nor does he a&s;k for more than a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance. You will have the ho|nour of patroni&s;ing an advocate; and, if he become celebrated, the work will not be un|worthy of you! Though you have hitherto done &s;o much and in various ways, this may
<PB N="257" REF="024210_0256_0FC569EB38B10020">
perhaps be wanting to your fame. My whole reliance is on you, &s;ir; for the times are fright|ful &s;ince nobody is intere&s;ted in behalf of talents. You alone know all who po&s;&s;e&s;s them; and you are their protector; and, &s;hould you think that I am among the number you will not &s;ure|ly for&s;ake me. My fortune then depends on the judgment which you &s;hall entertain of my capacity, and I expect your deci&s;ion with con|fidence. I lodge with M. Dubois, at the Pa|lais Royal, Rue de la Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;ai&s;e. Be|fore you enable me to remove to my hou&s;e, I &s;hall look for the honour of your an&s;wer.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE endeavoured during fifteen years to render my&s;elf worthy of your e&s;teem and your zeal for the intere&s;t of youthful poets in whom you di&s;cover talents. But having com|po&s;ed the mu&s;ic of an opera, I find my&s;elf, I know not how, metamorpho&s;ed into a mu&s;ician. In this quality the Duke de Richelieu commit|ted to my care the alteration of the Diverti&s;&s;e|ments which you have introduced into the Prince&s;s of Navarre, and he even required me to make &s;uch changes in the original plan as were nece&s;&s;ary to adapt it to your new &s;ubject. I made re&s;pectful remon&s;trances, the duke in&s;i&s;ted, and I obeyed; it is the only thing which can be done by a man in my &s;ituation. M. Ballot is charged to communicate the al|terations to you; which I have endeavoured to execute in the fewe&s;t words po&s;&s;ible, and that is the only merit I can give them. Do me the favour, &s;ir, to examine them, or ra|ther to &s;ub&s;titute others more worthy of the place which they were de&s;igned to occupy.</P>

<P>I will not dwell on this &s;ubject, nor violate, even when you are the object, the law I have re&s;olved to ob&s;erve never to addre&s;s the prai&s;|es of any one to him&s;elf, But, &s;ir, I will take the liberty to &s;ay that you formed an unworthy judgment of an hone&s;t man when you believed him capable of returning ingratitude and arro|gance for your kindne&s;s and politene&s;s to him in the affair of the F&ecirc;tes de Ramire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La Prince&s;&s;e de Navarre, which was afterwards called, Les F&ecirc;tes de Ramire.</NOTE>. I have not forgotten the letter with which you ho|noured me on that occa&s;ion, and which con|vinced me that, notwith&s;tanding ba&s;e calum|nies, you are the true patron of ri&s;ing talents which need protection. You deigned to pro|mi&s;e your friend&s;hip to the fir&s;t efforts of my mind; they were un&s;ucce&s;sful, and that was what I ought to have expected. A &s;olitary being who knew not how to &s;peak, a timid, di&s;|concerted man did not dare to pre&s;ent him&s;elf to you: and what would have been my title?
<PB N="262" REF="024210_0261_0FC569FA47711EF0">
But it was confidence and not zeal that I want|ed; fearing to intrude on your ob&s;ervation, I expected from time a favourable occa&s;ion to te&s;tify to you my re&s;pect and gratitude.</P>
<P>From that day I renounced letters and the delu&s;ive hope of acquiring fame; de&s;pairing to obtain that object by the aid of genius, I have di&s;dained to owe it, like ordinary men, to indirect means. But I never &s;hall renounce my admiration of your works. You have paint|ed friend&s;hip and every virtue as a man who under&s;tands and loves them. I have heard en|vy murmur but have rejected its clamours, and have &s;aid without fear of deceiving my&s;elf: "The&s;e writings which elevate the mind and excite fortitude are not the productions of a man indifferent to virtue."</P>
<P>Nor did you form ju&s;ter notions of a repub|lican, &s;ince I was known to you as &s;uch. I adore liberty, and equally dete&s;t de&s;poti&s;m and &s;ervitude, and would not impo&s;e either on any man. Such principles illy &s;ympathizs with in&s;olence; which is often the &s;entiment of &s;laves, or of men &s;till more vile than tho&s;e, little authors who are jealous of great talents.</P>
<P>I declare to you then, &s;ir, that not only Rou&s;|&s;eau of Geneva never held the di&s;cour&s;e you have attributed to him, but al&s;o that he is incapable of &s;uch language.

<P>I WAS, &s;ir, at the time informed of the in|gratitude and in&s;olence of the in&s;ignificant d'Arnaud toward you, and I expre&s;&s;ed my in|dignation at his conduct. I even de&s;ired M. d'Argental to refer back to the letter of Fr&eacute;|ron, and to take a copy of it. This letter was in the hands of every one, and was circulated in &s;o di&s;advantageous a manner that I wi&s;hed to &s;ee the preface, which was complained of, and which was accu&s;ed of being mutilated.

<P>I IMAGINE, &s;ir, you mu&s;t be informed that I have been &s;ettled at Geneva this two years. In the kind of nece&s;&s;ity to which I was reduced by the unjust conduct of the French comedians of Paris of quitting that place, there was no retreat which better &s;uited my natural inclination for repo&s;e and liberty; and I am &s;o much the more &s;atisfied with my choice as other rea&s;ons have led you to the &s;ame a&s;ylum. But it is not enough that our inclinations hap|pen to be mutual, our &s;entiments al&s;o &s;hould be in uni&s;on.

<P>My attachment to Rou&s;&s;eau, and my com|plai&s;ance to the Abb&eacute; Desfontains were the &s;ole cau&s;es of the offence I have given you. Their death has avenged you of them; and the little good I did by my &s;acrifices to them does not permit me to lament their death.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and men in my &s;ituation would tell you, &s;ir, that they e&s;teem you more than your mo&s;t zealous parti&s;ans, becau&s;e their e&s;teem was more con&s;i&s;tent and le&s;s blind. The proof, on my &s;ide, is inconte&s;tible.

I availed my&s;elf of your taking this city in your route; and through which I was al&s;o pa&s;&s;ing. The&s;e ver&s;es are yet more &s;ea&s;onable than ever, as I &s;hall be at Ge|neva on the 22d of this month, and as we &s;hall both be &s;ettled there. I have nothing to add but the following offers.</P>
<P>I have written a critici&s;m on your works in four volumes, which are yet in manu&s;cript; tho&s;e I will &s;end to you. Prefixed to my fir&s;t comedy is a letter with which you were offend|ed, as I have been formerly told, by Rou&s;&s;et; I will &s;uppre&s;s that letter in the edition of my works which I am preparing.

<P>I will do more; my fugitive pieces in two volumes are dedicated to a gentleman of the country of Vaud, who is anxious to be known to you, and who&s;e acquaintance would give you plea&s;ure; to convince the public of the &s;in|cerity of my regard for you, I am ready, with your permi&s;&s;ion, to dedicate my Theatre in four volumes to you. I do not think that you can require any thing further.</P>
<P>But &s;peaking of editions, it is time, &s;ir, that you re&s;olve, as well as my&s;elf, to publi&s;h an edition of your works, avowed by your&s;elf, and executed under your own in&s;pection. The public expect this with impatience, and they will not believe any thing to be yours which you do not your&s;elf give them.

<P>IN every re&s;pect, &s;ir, it is my duty to expre&s;s my gratitude to you; and, while I offered the rude outlines of my &s;orrowful reveries, I thought not of making a pre&s;ent worthy of you, but of acquitting my&s;elf of an obligation by rendering the homage which we all owe to you as our chief. Sen&s;ible, be&s;ide, of the honour
<PB N="269" REF="024210_0268_0FC56A0D18C078B8">
which you do my country, I participate in the gratitude of my fellow citizens, and hope that it will augment in proportion to the profit they may derive from your precepts. Embel|li&s;h the a&s;ylum you have cho&s;en, enlighten a people worthy of your le&s;&s;ons, and do you, who &s;o well know how to di&s;play liberty and virtue, teach us to cultivate them in our actions as we adore them in your writings. All who approach you ought to learn from you the road to glory and immortality.</P>
<P>You perceive, &s;ir, I do not a&s;pire to the re|putation of once more leading men into the woods; not but that I regret my part of the lo&s;s of a &s;tate of nature. With re&s;pect to your|&s;elf, &s;ir, to make you a &s;avage would be a mi|racle &s;o great that it can be wrought only by God, and &s;o pernicious that it can be willed only by the devil. Do not, therefore, attempt to walk on all-fours; to do which no man on earth is le&s;s qualified. You teach men too ef|fectually to &s;tand firmly not to remain erect your&s;elf. I own the di&s;grace which attends on celebrated men of letters is great indeed, nor do I deny that the evils are numerous which are attached to human nature, and which ap|pear to be independent of our vain knowledge. Men have opened &s;o many &s;ources of mi&s;ery to them&s;elves that their happine&s;s is but little in|crea&s;ed when they chance to e&s;cape a &s;ingle misfortune. There are &s;ecret connexions, however, in the progre&s;s of things which are
<PB N="270" REF="024210_0269_0FC56A0E857B0BB0">
unperceived by the vulgar, but which do not e&s;cape the thoughtful eye of the philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>It was neither Terence, Cicero, Virgil, Se|neca, nor Tacitus, who cau&s;ed the crimes of the Romans and the misfortunes of Rome. But without the &s;low and &s;ecret poi&s;on which in&s;en&s;ibly corrupted the mo&s;t vigorous govern|ment of which hi&s;tory has pre&s;erved the re|membrance, Cicero, Lucretius, Sallu&s;t, and &s;uch men had never exi&s;ted or they had never written. The amiable age of Laelius and Te|rence in&s;en&s;ibly introduced the brilliant period of Horace and Augu&s;tus; and, in fine, the hor|rid epoch of Seneca and Nero, that of Taci|tus and Domitian. A ta&s;te for the arts and &s;ciences has its birth in a &s;ecret vice which it &s;oon augments in its turn; and if it be true that all human acquirements are pernicious to the &s;pecies, tho&s;e of the mind and of know|ledge, which increa&s;e our pride and multiply our wanderings, will &s;oone&s;t accelerate men's misfortunes. Yet, there nece&s;&s;arily comes a time in which tho&s;e acquirements are requi&s;ite to &s;tay the progre&s;s of evil: it is the &s;teel which mu&s;t remain in the wound, lea&s;t, in removing it, the wounded &s;hould expire.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, had I pur&s;ued my fir&s;t voca|tion and neither read nor written, I &s;hould have been unque&s;tionably more happy; yet if letters could now be entirely effaced, I &s;hould be deprived of the only plea&s;ure which is left me. It is in letters that I find a con&s;olation for all my misfortunes; it is among their illu&s;trious

children that I ta&s;te the delights of friend&s;hip, and learn to enjoy life and de&s;pi&s;e death. To them I owe the little merit I have, and to them am I al&s;o indebted for the honour of being known to you. But let us con&s;ult inter|e&s;t in our concerns, and truth in our writings. Although there need philo&s;ophers, hi&s;torians, and truly learned men to enlighten the world and conduct its blind inhabitants, yet, if the wi&s;e Memnon has not mi&s;informed me, I know nothing more ridiculous than a nation of &s;ages. Confe&s;s, &s;ir, if it be right that great minds &s;hould in&s;truct men, the vulgar ought to re|ceive their precepts.

Neverthele&s;s, in this learned age, we &s;ee none but the lame willing to teach others to walk.</P>
<P>Ordinary men receive the writings of the learned to critici&s;e them, and not to in&s;truct them&s;elves. Never was the world &s;warmed with &s;uch dwarfs in intellect; they crowd the theatre, the coffee-hou&s;es re&s;ound with their &s;entences, the book&s;ellers &s;talls are covered with their writings, and I hear the Orphan critici&s;ed, becau&s;e it is applauded, by a &s;chool boy &s;o little capable of perceiving its defects that &s;carcely can he feel any of its beauties.</P>
<P>Let us look for the fir&s;t &s;ource of all the di&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ders in &s;ociety, and we &s;hall find that the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;eries

of mankind proceed from error rather than ignorance; and that what we do not know is much le&s;s prejudicial to us than that which we think we under&s;tand. Now what &s;urer means to run from error to error than the rage of knowing every thing? Had not men pretended to know that the earth does not turn on its axis, they had not puni&s;hed Gallieo, for having affirmed that it did turn. If none but philo&s;ophers had claimed the title of philo&s;opher, the Encyclop&eacute;dia had experi|enced no per&s;ecution. If a hundred de&s;picable beings had not a&s;pired to fame, you would have been left to the peaceful enjoyment of yours, or at lea&s;t you would have had to con|tend with none but adver&s;aries worthy of you. Be not &s;urpri&s;ed then &s;hould you feel &s;ome thorns which are in&s;eperable from the flowers that adorn &s;uperior talents.

<P>I have ever thought, &s;ir, that the fir&s;t duty of a man who wi&s;hed to acquire fame in any &s;pecies of poetry, would be to form his ta&s;te on your writings, and the &s;econd to offer his e&s;&s;ays to your in&s;pection. I acquit my&s;elf of this la&s;t, with much reliance on your indul|gence and advice. Hitherto tho&s;e whom I have con&s;ulted have given me &s;uch various coun|&s;els, that I know not which to pur&s;ue. I am reproached by one for having too clo&s;ely imi|tated la Fontaine; and by another, for not having &s;ufficiently imitated him. This friend complains that the morals of my fables are too long; this, that they are too &s;hort; and a third would compel me to &s;uppre&s;s them all,
<PB N="275" REF="024210_0274_0FC56A2082E7CE10">
alledging, notwith&s;tanding the example of all the fabuli&s;ts, that the object of a fable &s;hould be &s;o inforced by the fable it&s;elf, as to pa&s;s for that &s;pecies of commentary which is called the moral.

<P>THE letter is good, and the rea&s;oning and the manner are excellent. I have only two ob&s;ervations to make.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. I know not whether I would &s;o po&s;i|tively pre&s;ent to him the idea of re&s;titution. I imagine this mu&s;t ever be a bitter draught, and I know not whether it will not injure his fame as much as his intere&s;t. Perhaps it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;often this pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P N="2">2d. I think it would be expedient further to explain to him the ba&s;is of a &s;y&s;tem of paci|fication which &s;hould originate in his own ideas, &s;uch as they are found in his la&s;t letter; con&s;equently to me it appears that I &s;hould addre&s;s him thus:</P>
<P>You will not make peace but in conjunction with the Engli&s;h, and you are right, for your honour is pledged; but why will you not make peace for the Engli&s;h and for your&s;elf at the &s;ame time? Have you not &s;ufficient claims to their e&s;teem, or a&s;cendency enough over them, to induce them to &s;acrifice &s;ome of their
<PB N="280" REF="024210_0279_0FC56A2BE01DFC20">
advantages to the honour of &s;ecuring your own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions? Would not the French, in compen&s;ation for &s;uch a benefit, be impelled and authori&s;ed to prevail on their allies to make conce&s;&s;ions equivalent to tho&s;e which the Engli&s;h &s;hould have made in your favour?

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DID I not know you to be &s;ufficiently wi&s;e to look with contempt on the baubles of gran|deur &s;o as not to be &s;u&s;ceptible of them, I &s;hould feel no &s;urpri&s;e that you had di&s;dained to an&s;wer the letter I ventured to write to you, in which my heart de&s;cribed all its &s;en&s;ations. I was convinced when my hand was the faithful interpreter of my &s;entiments that the dignity of yours would not &s;uffer you to remain in&s;en|&s;ible to the afflictions of an unfortunate man, and that you knew how to dry up the tears
<PB N="283" REF="024210_0282_0FC56A335C501F88">
which grief had cau&s;ed to flow. I was per|&s;uaded that your bounty would not be implor|ed in vain, that your arms would readily open to afford innocence an a&s;ylum, and that your heart was &s;uperior even to your under&s;tand|ing; &s;uch were, &s;uch &s;till are, my thoughts; and the&s;e emboldened me to explain my me|lancholy &s;ituation in my fir&s;t letter. Imagine, &s;ir, whether I am not afflicted by your &s;ilence at pre&s;ent. Alas, perhaps you have &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould repay your friend&s;hip and favours with the blacke&s;t ingratitude, and that I &s;hould be cowardly and criminal enough not to be grate|ful. Act, &s;ir, as you plea&s;e with re&s;pect to my other reque&s;ts, but let me entreat you not to do me the inju&s;tice of thus &s;u&s;pecting my probity. This is the only wealth I now po&s;&s;e&s;s, it is a pre|cious jewel which I wi&s;h to pre&s;erve from the general contagion. Your &s;u&s;picions dim its lu&s;|tre, but your genero&s;ity and greatne&s;s of mind may pre&s;erve and render it more re&s;plendent. Affection, zeal, and re&s;pect, are all the wealth I have, and now are and ever will remain yours. Were you to refu&s;e me what I have reque&s;ted with &s;o much ardour, but which it may be im|proper for you to grant, I &s;hould ever remain convinced your refu&s;al was dictated by virtue, and that you were guided by rea&s;ons unknown to me; and I then &s;hould only be anxious of being informed of what they were. In fine, &s;ir, whatever your kind intentions may be, let me de&s;ire you would inform a youth of them

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT one of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t en|amoured with the Belles Lettres without the power of &s;tudying them, and with the&s;e men of genius who &s;tudy them with &s;ucce&s;s, to take the pre&s;ent opportunity of renewing that ho|mage which is more flattering to him&s;elf than to you. The &s;entiments which I have inge|nuou&s;ly avowed appear to have affected you, and for the&s;e I am &s;ufficiently repaid &s;hould your feelings have been in union with mine.</P>
<P>The kindne&s;s which you have &s;hewn toward me, induces me to a&s;k a favour. During the&s;e &s;hort intervals which employment more gloo|my have allowed me to dedicate to my love of poetry, I have formed the ra&s;h de&s;ign of wri|ting a tragedy, the &s;ubject of which is perhaps the mo&s;t &s;ingular and intere&s;ting of any to be found in modern &s;tory. It is the death of Charles I. and the u&s;urpation of Cromwell. The difficulties attending &s;uch a fable were
<PB N="285" REF="024210_0284_0FC56A3657A52D48">
great, nor have I by the labour of a year been able to &s;urmount them. I have written no|thing more hitherto than the plan of my piece; after having changed it &s;everal times, and mo&s;t mercile&s;sly burnt one entire act, and more, which did not equal the high idea I had form|ed of my &s;ubject. I am not, however, di&s;cou|raged, but have begun again; yet my ardour has &s;lackened, becau&s;e I have been informed that you have for &s;ome time been your&s;elf at work on the &s;ame &s;ubject, and that &s;oon or late you intend to pre&s;ent your piece to the public.</P>
<P>You may well imagine, &s;ir, that my ra&s;h|ne&s;s is not quite great enough to contend with an antagoni&s;t like your&s;elf. It belongs only to a few to enter the li&s;ts with and vanqui&s;h their ma&s;ters. I &s;hould quickly abandon my plan, were I certain that you had formed the &s;ame; and e&s;pecially as this perhaps will be the only work I &s;hall ever write during a life of ob&s;curity; and bani&s;hed as I am to a town in which there are men of wit, but who make no u&s;e of that quality, and who hate or de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who do. My days will be &s;hortened by labour, which is the only wealth and the only plea&s;ure of which fortune could not deprive me; and Cromwell only, to whom I &s;hould dedicate the remains of life, would pre&s;erve the memory of a youth who grew too early old becau&s;e he began to think too &s;oon.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ir, at the age of &s;even, I endeavoured
<PB N="286" REF="024210_0285_0FC56A37B736C400">
to cultivate poetry, and you may ea&s;ily ima|gine how much a&s;&s;iduous &s;tudy injures the health of a child. Excu&s;e me for having &s;o long de|tained you on &s;ubjects of &s;o little moment. On|ly let me intreat you to inform me whether I ought to continue my project, and whether you have not anticipated my de&s;ign. Deign to afford me le&s;&s;ons, of which I am too much in want, and of which I am &s;o de&s;irous, that you will &s;carcely refu&s;e them. By your aid, I may di&s;cover impediments which I have not fore&s;een, or beauties which I could never have invented. You will encourage me in executing a difficult ta&s;k, and will teach me to avoid rocks and quick-&s;ands, among which I &s;hould otherwi&s;e be wrecked, but which your genius will enable me to e&s;cape. Do not, I conjure you, deny the reque&s;t of a youth who &s;eeks for in&s;truction, who re&s;pects his ma&s;ters, who loves your per&s;on becau&s;e he loves your works in which your &s;oul &s;hines forth, and who is in|debted to you for every thing, becau&s;e from you he has learned to think.</P>

<P>I HAVE broken my bonds, &s;ir, and have &s;haken of cla&s;&s;ic du&s;t. Here am I at Paris, in
<PB N="287" REF="024210_0286_0FC56A3B7B1C2FD8">
freedom and almo&s;t happine&s;s, and in the cen|tre of the arts where I &s;o long have de&s;ired to live and cultivate literature. But, ah, &s;ir, how &s;trangely have literature and good ta&s;te gone to decay! How little does all I &s;ee a&s;&s;i|milate with the ideas I had formed from read|ing our be&s;t authors! I am fallen as it were from the clouds. I under&s;tand no man, and no man under&s;tands me. They tell me of co|medies which make the audience weep, and I &s;ee tragedies which oblige me to laugh. I am de&s;ired to write in the &s;ame ta&s;te, and I do not know what ta&s;te they mean. It is nece&s;&s;ary, however, that I &s;hould &s;ubmit; and I begin to perceive the thing it not &s;o very difficult.</P>
<P>I really, &s;ir, do not know what will hereaf|ter be thought of the pre&s;ent age; but I am convinced that it is intolerably like the age of Seneca and Silius Italicus. You, &s;ir, are the man who beheld the meridian of the Belles Let|tres, and for the decline of which you long have con&s;oled us; but you have the affliction of not leaving any hope behind you of &s;imilar con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Pardon this complaint &s;ir, from a gloomy parti&s;an of old ta&s;te, and an admirer of your works. I cannot prevail on my&s;elf ever to think that beautiful which never can be &s;o, unle&s;s it be proved that Moli&egrave;re, Racine, Boileau, and your&s;elf are wretched writers.</P>
<P>But I come to the main purport of my let|ter, which is to thank you for having procured
<PB N="288" REF="024210_0287_0FC56A3E4901E498">
me the acquaintance of M. de la Harpe. I cannot &s;ufficiently prai&s;e his politene&s;s, the goodne&s;s of the advice he has given me, and particularly the veneration which he expre&s;&s;es for you, He &s;wears by your name as Philocte|tes &s;wore by Hercules; and I have no doubt but that he will nobly fill the part of Philocte|tes. He will certainly be well able to oppo&s;e the torrent, and combat the mon&s;ters of litera|ture. But the evil is too deeply rooted; his his example will come too late; and he will only be able to &s;ave him&s;elf from the general &s;hipwreck.</P>
<P>I did not find the minds of men much preju|diced in favour of my M&eacute;d&eacute;e non-Magicienne (Medea no Enchantre&s;s.) They took it ill that I &s;hould rob the &s;tage of a &s;plendid &s;pectacle which produced &s;o fine an effect in the opinion of merchant's clerks, and of the vulgar. They further add that the magic invocations of Lon|ge pierre have their charms; and that his ver&s;ifi|cation will again become plea&s;ant to our ears. In vain did I affirm with you that an enchan|tre&s;s cannot affect the pa&s;&s;ions which are totally de&s;troyed by magic, and would be thought ri|diculous in any other character except Medea, and that it is di&s;gu&s;ting and mon&s;trous for her to kill her children without any cau&s;e, &s;ince &s;he might have carried them off in her carr. I added a thou&s;and other things of the &s;ame nature, but to no effect; and I find the people of this philo&s;ophic age are more addicted to &s;orcery than they &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="024210_0288_0FC56A4163296F30">In fine, &s;ir, I have put my piece into the hands of M. le Kain, and am waiting for his opini|on previous to the reading of it to the actors collectively. I do not augur much &s;ucce&s;s, but I will con&s;ole my&s;elf by writing better.</P>
<P>As my revenues are not &s;ufficiently great to enable me to &s;ub&s;i&s;t entirely as a poet, I am in &s;earch of &s;ome proper employment either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as a &s;ecretary or a teacher in &s;ome good fa|mily.

For the&s;e two years I have habitually paid the tribute which age owes to nature. An a&s;th|ma was my prevailing and familiar malady; however, a &s;evere regimen, and a plant which I do not know, but of which I have fortunately procured a good &s;tock, though I have no occa|&s;ion to u&s;e it at pre&s;ent, cau&s;ed every &s;ymptom to di&s;appear toward autumn. My health there|therefore
<PB N="291" REF="024210_0290_0FC56A4608F7F1B8">
is as good as I could wi&s;h, but my trifling fortune and my affairs are in the ut|mo&s;t confu&s;ion. I have for three years paid 600 livres annually, in con&s;equence of the en|gagements into which I entered at the marri|age of my daughter.</P>
<P>The following is the &s;tate of my income: 1200 livres from the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, of which only a thou&s;and are clear profit, 200 being &s;et apart to pay for the journals and papers from which I make my extracts, and for copying tho&s;e and other works which I find it nece&s;&s;ary to add. The&s;e 1000 livres from the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, with an annuity of 2600 livres, which is &s;ecured on the Hotel de Ville, and 400 livres per annum, paid me by the Count de Laura|guais, gave me hopes of extricating my&s;elf from my difficulties, and of even continuing to pay the 600 livres according to my engagement. But a new perpetual charge has accrued by the nece&s;&s;ity of my taking a &s;econd wife to aid me in my infirmities.</P>
<P>You did me the favour to inform me, in the beginning of 1766, when I begged you to re|member me in the di&s;tribution of your bene|factions that I had deferred my application too long, and that as a puni&s;hment I mu&s;t wait longer; that I ought to have reminded you of my granary in the time of the harve&s;t, and that every body had gleaned except my&s;elf, &s;eeing I did not pre&s;ent my&s;elf among the re&s;t. You promi&s;ed to repair the ill con&s;equence of
<PB N="292" REF="024210_0291_0FC56A4994B7AE30">
my negligence, and you added in the mo&s;t obliging and gratifying manner that you had the &s;ame regard for me as formerly.</P>
<P>This recalls to my mind with what zeal you undertook and endeavoured, toward the latter end of the regency, to procure half of your pen|&s;ion to be &s;ettled on me and in what manner, through your &s;olicitations, the Duke de Melun intere&s;ted him&s;elf in the &s;ucce&s;s of that de&s;ign under the admini&s;tration of the regent. But the &s;orrowful events which followed in rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion rendered ineffectual this uncommon in&s;tance of friend&s;hip and benevolence, and which was particularly noticed in the Hollard Gazette. Hence, I have ever found my&s;elf en|couraged to &s;ay to you, when there &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ld b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> occa&s;ion, as Horace &s;aid to Mecaenas while he enumerated his benefactions: Nec &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ra ve|lim, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u dare deneges.</P>

<P>The peace of 1748, having re&s;tored every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ecies of diver&s;ion to the city of Paris, be|come the memorable epoch of a new in&s;titu|tion of &s;ome &s;ocieties formed of trade&s;men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he met together for the plea&s;ure of playing dramatic pieces.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was e&s;tabli&s;hed at the Hotel de Soyecourt in the Faubourg Saint-Honor&eacute;; the &s;econd, at the Hotel de Clermont Tonnerre <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Mar&s;hes; and the third, at the Hotel de Jabac in the Rue Saint-M&eacute;ri; of which la&s;t theatre I was the founder.</P>
<P>Among the young people who at that time played with &s;ome reputation, and part of

whom have &s;ince &s;ettled in the country, I am the only one who remained at Paris; and this circum&s;tance, which I owed rather to my good fortune than any &s;uperiority of talents, hap|pened in the following way.</P>
<P>The room in which we performed in the Hotel de Jabac being in &s;uch condition that the repairing of it could be no longer delayed, we were under the nece&s;&s;ity of reque&s;ting permi&s;&s;ion of the comedians of the Hotel de Clermont. Tonnerre to play an their theatre, alternately with them. An agreement was accordingly entered into by both parties, in the month of July, 1749, by which we were bound to pay half the expences; and we open|ed with Sidney and George-Dandin.</P>
<P>It will be readily &s;uppo&s;ed that the emula|tion of the two companies would excite di&s;|putes in the public, the re&s;ult of which could not be favourable to one without dimini&s;hing the reputation which the other till then had enjoyed. The audience were divided in their opinion of the&s;e gentlemen and of tho&s;e, of the young ladies of this theatre and the young ladies of that. The fir&s;t were more plea&s;ing, but the other di&s;played more knowledge of the theatre, and more grace and art, &amp;c. Thus were the public amu&s;ed and combatted &s;ome for the company de Tonnerre, and others for the company de Jabac. But who could have imagined that a &s;ociety of young people who united plea&s;ure and decorum could provoke
<PB N="295" REF="024210_0294_0FC56A4FC8BE9A08">
the jealou&s;y and complaints of the high-prie&s;ts of Melpomene? Yet, their influence inter|rupted our performances, and a Jan&s;eni&s;t prie&s;t re-e&s;tabli&s;hed them. The Abb&eacute; de Chauvelin, Con&s;&eacute;iller-Clerc of the parliament of Paris, conde&s;cended to employ his power in behalf of pupils again&s;t their ma&s;ters, and we played the Mauvais-riche, a new comedy in five acts and in ver&s;e, written by M. de Arnaud, to the mo&s;t brilliant a&s;&s;embly then in Paris; but it was received with little applau&s;e. This was in the month of February, 1750.</P>
<P>M. de Voltaire was invited by the author to &s;ee the repre&s;entation; and, whether induced by his compa&s;&s;ion for M. d' Arnaud or his complai&s;ance to the actors who to the utmo&s;t exerted them&s;elves to give &s;ome value to that feeble unintere&s;ting work, this great man ap|peared well plea&s;ed, and particularly inquired who it was that played the part of the lover. He was informed that the performer was the &s;on of a gold&s;mith of Paris who played for his amu&s;ement, but who really wi&s;hed to make it his &s;erious employment. He expre&s;&s;ed to M. Arnaud a de&s;ire of knowing me; and de&s;ired him to engage me to pay him a vi&s;it on the following day.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure this invitation gave me was even greater than my &s;urpri&s;e; but it is im|po&s;&s;ible for me to de&s;cribe the &s;en&s;ations of my mind when I beheld this man who&s;e eyes burned with imagination and genius. As I

&s;pake to him I felt my&s;elf penetrated with en|thu&s;ia&s;m, admiration, and fear; but while I experienced the&s;e &s;en&s;ations, M. de Voltaire had the goodne&s;s to put an end to my embar|ra&s;&s;ment by taking me in his arms and thank|ing God for having created a being who could excite his feelings by the repetition of &s;uch moderate ver&s;es.</P>
<P>He afterwards made &s;everal enquiries rela|tive to my &s;ituation, and that of my father, the manner in which I have been educated, and the ideas I entertained of my future fortune. Having &s;atisfied him on the&s;e &s;ubjects, and hav|ing partaken of a dozen cups of coffee mixed with chocolate, the only nouri&s;hment which M. de Voltaire took from five in the morning till three in the afternoon, I informed him with great earne&s;tne&s;s that I knew no other happi|ne&s;s on earth than that of playing dramatic pieces; that a melancholy lo&s;s had left me ma&s;ter of my actions, and that enjoying a &s;mall patrimony of &s;even hundred and fifty livres income, I had rea&s;on to hope that &s;hould I abandon my father's occupation, I &s;hould lo&s;e nothing by the change, provided I could one day be admitted into the king's company of comedians.</P>
<P>"Ah my friend," cried M. de Voltaire, "never take that re&s;olution; continue to per|form for your plea&s;ure, but think not of mak|ing this your profe&s;&s;ion. It is one of the great|e&s;t and mo&s;t difficult talents, but it is degrad|ed
<PB N="297" REF="024210_0296_0FC56A52C2DBBC38">
by unfeeling people and pro&s;cribed by hy|pocrites. France &s;hall one day e&s;teem your art, but it will then no longer po&s;&s;e&s;s Baron, le Couvreur, or Dangeville. If you will re|nounce your de&s;ign I will lend you ten thou|&s;and francs to employ in commerce, and you &s;hall return the &s;um as it &s;hall be convenient to you. Come to me again at the end of the weak; reflect well on the &s;ubject, and ac|quaint me with your po&s;&s;itive determination."</P>
<P>Di&s;concerted, and moved almo&s;t to the &s;hedding of tears, with the generous offer of this exalted being whom men have called ava|ricious, inflexible, and unfeeling, I wi&s;hed to give way to my &s;entiments in expre&s;&s;ing of gratitude, and four times began a &s;peech with|out being once able to fini&s;h it. At length I re&s;olved to take my leave, which I attempted with a &s;tammering voice; but as I retired he called me back and de&s;ired me to recite &s;ome mor&s;els of any part which I had been accu&s;|tomed to play. Without con&s;idering the &s;ub|ject I fooli&s;hly enough propo&s;ed to &s;peak the celebrated couplet in the &s;econd act of Gu&s;ta|vus. "No, not Piron," &s;aid M. de Voltaire, with a piercing and terrifying voice, "I wi&s;h not to hear bad ver&s;es. Repeat me any part you know from Racine."</P>
<P>Fortunately I recollected that while I was at the College de Mazarin I had learned the whole tragedy of Athal&iuml;e by having heard that play repeated numerous times by the &s;cholars
<PB N="298" REF="024210_0297_0FC56A544531E520">
who performed it. I began therefore at the fir&s;t &s;cene and played Abner and Joad alter|nately. But I had not fini&s;hed my ta&s;k when M. de Voltaire &s;uddenly cried with enthu&s;ia&s;m, "Ah, my God what poetry, and how a&s;toni&s;h|ing that this tragedy &s;hould be written through|out with the &s;ame purity and pa&s;&s;ion!" He then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me; and &s;aid, while he embra|ced me, "I fore&s;ee that you will po&s;&s;e&s;s a mo&s;t pathetic voice; and that you will become the delight of Paris; but think no more of a pub|lic theatre."</P>
<P>This is an exact account of my fir&s;t vi&s;it to M. de Voltaire. The &s;econd was more con|clu&s;ive, as he con&s;ented, after the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;olicitations on my &s;ide, to receive me into his hou&s;e, and to allow me a yearly income; he built, over his own apartment, a &s;mall theatre in which he had the goodne&s;s to &s;ee me and the whole company to which I belong|ed play with his nieces. He could not reflect without the &s;tronge&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure that till then we had been permitted to expend much money to afford amu&s;ement to our friends and to the public.</P>
<P>The expence which M. de Voltaire incurred by this temporary e&s;tabli&s;hment, and his for|mer di&s;intere&s;ted offer to me, convinced me in the &s;tronge&s;t manner that he was as noble and generous in his actions as his enemies were unju&s;t while they a&s;cribed to him the vice of &s;ordid economy. The&s;e were facts of which I
<PB N="299" REF="024210_0298_0FC56A578B437028">
was my&s;elf a witne&s;s; but truth obliges me further to confe&s;s that M. de Voltaire did not only aid me with his advice for more than &s;ix months, but al&s;o that he defrayed my expen|ces during the whole of that time, and that &s;ince my being e&s;tabli&s;hed in the theatre I hate proofs of receiving from him more than two thou&s;and crowns. At pre&s;ent he calls me "His great actor, His Carrick, His dear child!" The&s;e are titles which I owe &s;olely to his partiality for me; but the title which my heart adopts is that of a re&s;pectful and grateful pupil.</P>
<P>And indeed I ought to be grateful &s;ince it was to M. de Voltaire alone that I owed the fir&s;t notions of my art; and &s;ince it was &s;olely through his intere&s;t that the Duke de Aumont thought proper to grant the order for my fir&s;t appearance at the theatre in the month of September, 1750; the re&s;ult of which was that, aided by a per&s;everance, proof again&s;t every ob&s;tacle, I, at the end of &s;eventeen months, &s;urmounted all oppo&s;ition from the city and the court, and was entered on the li&s;t of the king's comedians in the mouth of February, 1752.</P>
<P>Whoever reads the&s;e details will ob&s;erve that I am far from re&s;embling tho&s;e ungrate|ful hearts who blu&s;h to acknowledge a bene|faction; and who, to complete their ba&s;ene&s;s, meanly calumniate their benefactors. I have known more than one of that kind connected
<PB N="300" REF="024210_0299_0FC5686602EC7190" MS="y">
with M. de Voltaire. I have been witne&s;s of the depredations which have been made on him by people of every rank. Some he has pitied, &s;ilently de&s;pi&s;ed others, but never avenged him&s;elf of any. The book&s;ellers, whom he has prodigiou&s;ly enriched by the various editions of his works, have ever publicly a&s;per&s;ed his character; but there is not one of them who has dared to attack him in a court of ju&s;tice, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cious as they were of their guilt.</P>
<P>The friend&s;hip of M. de Voltaire is ever un&s;haken. His manner is impetuous, his heart good, his &s;oul compa&s;&s;ionate; he is mode&s;t in in an extreme degree, notwith&s;tanding the prai&s;es which have been lavi&s;hed on him by kings, by men of letters, and by a people a&s;|&s;embled to hear and admire him; profound and ju&s;t in his opinion of the works of other writers, abounding with affability and polite|ne&s;s in his commerce with men, and inflexible toward tho&s;e who have offended him. In the&s;e features his character will be &s;een drawn with truth.</P>
<P>He could never be reproached with having been the fir&s;t to attack his adver&s;aries; but, after ho&s;tilities were commenced, he has ap|peared as a lion ru&s;hing from his retreat, and at &s;uch times &s;ome of his enemies have fallen before him, and others have taken their flight.</P>
<P>I have heard him frequently &s;ay, that his being unable to po&s;&s;e&s;s the friend&s;hip of Cr&eacute;|billon gave him great affliction; that he had
<PB N="301" REF="024210_0300_0FC568677154C0F0">
ever e&s;teemed his abilities, but could never pardon his having refu&s;ed his approbation to Mahomet.</P>
<P>I will &s;ay nothing of the &s;ublimity of his va|rious talents; in whatever way he exerci&s;ed them, he di&s;played erudition, wit, ta&s;te, and philo&s;ophy; and Europe will pronounce his eulogium. His works, di&s;tributed over the earth, are &s;ufficient to form the materials of his prai&s;e; and happy is he who can appreci|ate them, and &s;peak worthily of this celebrat|ed and extraordinary man.</P>
<P>The facility with which he wrote is univer|&s;ally known; but few have been witne&s;s to &s;uch in&s;tances as the following, which I my|&s;elf &s;aw.</P>
<P>His amanuen&s;is had lo&s;t or de&s;troyed the fifth act of the tragedy of Zulima. M. de Vol|taire produced another in a very &s;hort time, and which abounded with new ideas, that cir|cum&s;tances had &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>He altered the character of Cicero, in the fourth act of Rome Pre&s;erved, when we per|formed that tragedy in the month of Augu&s;t, 1750, at the theatre of the Duche&s;s du Maine, at the Chateau de Sceaux. I think it is not po&s;&s;ible that any one could be more true, more pathetic, or more enthu&s;ia&s;tic than M. de Vol|taire in this part. It was, indeed, Cicero him&s;elf, pouring forth his eloquence from the tribunal, again&s;t the de&s;troyer of his country, of its laws, its manners, and its religion. I
<PB N="302" REF="024210_0301_0FC56868F405A850">
cannot forget that the Duche&s;s du Maine, af|ter having expre&s;&s;ed her admiration of this new part, a&s;ked M. de Voltaire who was the performer of Lentulus; Sura, and that M. de Voltaire an&s;wered, "Madam, he is the be&s;t of us all." It was my&s;elf whom he treated with &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed goodne&s;s, nor was it very flattering to the knights, counts, and marqui&s;&s;es, who&s;e companion I then was.</P>
<P>I will not conclude this article without nam|ing &s;ome other anecdotes which were within my own knowledge, and which may perhaps &s;erve to give &s;till more correct ideas of the character of M. de Voltaire.</P>
<P>It is well known that, on the death of the celebrated Baron, and on the retreat of Bauberg from the &s;tage, both the comic and the tragic parts of the&s;e great actors were given to Sar|ra&s;in, who at that time did not approach near the excellence of his ma&s;ters, a circum&s;tance which drew a &s;evere &s;arca&s;m from Voltaire, who had committed to him the part of Brutus in the tragedy of the &s;ame name. The piece was rehear&s;ed at the theatre, and the feeble|ne&s;s of Sarra&s;in in his invocation to Mars, his want of vigour, grandeur, and dignity through|out the fir&s;t act, excited Voltaire's indignati|on to &s;uch a degree that he cried out, "Sir, do you recollect that you are Brutus, the mo&s;t augu&s;t of all the Roman Con&s;uls, and that you mu&s;t not addre&s;s the god Mars as you would &s;ay, Ah good Virgin, let me gain a prize of a hundred francs in the lottery!"</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="024210_0302_0FC5686C369D7DB8">The re&s;ult of this new mode of in&s;truction was that Sarra&s;in di&s;played no more &s;trength of animation, for he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e qua|lities, and was only a good actor when the &s;cene required pathos. He knew not the art of painting the pa&s;&s;ions with energy, nor was the &s;oul of Mithridates, nor the dignity of Augu&s;tus ever perceived in him.</P>
<P>The celebrity which Mademoi&s;elle Dume&s;nil had acquired in the part of Merope, and which &s;he has uniformly maintained during twenty years is well known. Yet even this reputation was no protection from the railleries of M. de Voltaire. When &s;he rehear&s;ed Merope for the fir&s;t time he ob&s;erved that this famous actre&s;s did not inveigh again&s;t Polifonte in the fourth act with &s;ufficient vehemence and pa&s;&s;ion. "I mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the devil," &s;aid Madame Dume&s;nil, "to a&s;&s;ume the tone you de&s;ire." "Yes, Madam," an&s;wered Voltaire, "we mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the devil to excel in any art!" I believe that M. de Voltaire then &s;poke a great truth,</P>
<P>He was one day a&s;ked his opinion re&s;pecting the propriety with which &s;ome preferred Made|moi&s;&s;elle Dume&s;nil to Mademoi&s;elle Clairon, and the ju&s;tne&s;s of that enthu&s;ia&s;m which this la&s;t excited in the public to the great mortification of the actre&s;s who had &s;erved her as a model. The parti&s;ans of the old ta&s;te pretended that to &s;eize on the &s;oul and to excite its feelings, it was nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;&s;e&s;s, like Mademoi&s;elle Dume&s;|nil,
<PB N="304" REF="024210_0303_0FC5686F94F12908">the magic wand of Corncille, and that Mademoi&s;elle Clarion had it not. "She has it in the throat," cried Voltaire; and the que&s;|tion was accurately decided.</P>
<P>A very young and beautiful girl, daughter of a Procureur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An Attorney.</NOTE> belonging to the parliament, played with me the part of Palmire in Maho|met, on M. de Voltaire's theatre. This ami|able girl, who was but fifteen years old, was far from being able to &s;peak with &s;ufficient &s;trength and grandeur the imprecations which it was her part to utter again&s;t her tyrant. She was young, hand&s;ome, and intere&s;ting, and M. de Voltaire a&s;&s;umed more gentlene&s;s while he &s;hewed her how far di&s;tant &s;he was from the &s;pirit of her part. "Madam," &s;aid he to her, "imagine to your&s;elf that Mahomet is an impo&s;tor, an attrocious villian, who cau|&s;ed your father to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, has ju&s;t poi|&s;oned your brother, and who to crown his kindne&s;s would ab&s;olutely ravi&s;h your&s;elf. If all this trifling treachery gives you a certain plea&s;ure, your politene&s;s to him is well judged. But if he excited the lea&s;t di&s;gu&s;t in you, this, Madam, it the tone that you &s;hould a&s;&s;ume."</P>
<P>Then M. de Voltaire him&s;elf repeated the imprecation and gave this poor innocent girl, who was blu&s;hing with &s;hame and trembling with fear, a le&s;&s;on &s;o much more precious as he joined precept to example; and &s;he after|wards became a very plea&s;ing actre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="024210_0304_0FC5687072B4E178">In 1755, being at M. de Voltaire's hou&s;e of the Delices near Geneva, which he had ju&s;t obtained from the attorney-general Tronchin, he depo&s;ited in my hands the Orphan of China, which was at fir&s;t in three acts, and which he named his hidden trea&s;ure. Speaking of a noble character in this tragedy which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great novelty, he &s;aid to me, "My friend, the inflexions of your voice are naturally &s;oft and melodious, but beware of &s;uffering any of tho&s;e to e&s;cape you in the part of Gengis Khan. You mu&s;t impre&s;s it &s;trongly on your mind that I have painted him as a tyger who, while he care&s;&s;es his female, &s;trikes his talons into her &s;ides. If the other performers find the piece languid in parts, I permit them to make cur|tailments. The&s;e are citizens that we mu&s;t &s;ometimes &s;acrifice to the &s;afety of the republic. But take care that they u&s;e the licence with caution; for fal&s;e critics are often more dan|gerous in dictating the&s;e &s;ort of alterations, than men who are down-right ignorant."</P>
<P>After my departure from Ferney, in the month of April, 1762, M. de Voltaire formed a de&s;ire to have the Orphan of China played at his little theatre. The book&s;eller Cramer &s;tudied the part of Gengis Khan, under the in&s;truction of the Duke de Villars. The pre|tentions of this nobleman to teach the art of performing on the &s;tage are well known; he made his pupil Cramer a cold, in&s;ipid, declaim|er. M. de Voltaire was not &s;low to perceive
<PB N="306" REF="024210_0305_0FC5687226BE80B8">
the defect; and, in the fir&s;t rehear&s;al, he was more than ever convinced that a man may be at the &s;ame time a duke, a fine wit, and the &s;on of a great man, without any of the&s;e titles giving him talents to exerci&s;e the fine arts, knowledge to comprehend their principles, or ta&s;te to decide on their execution.</P>
<P>M. de Voltaire hi&s;&s;ed Cramer; and threat|ened to torment him this way till he &s;hould have changed his &s;tyle of acting. The faithful Geneve&s;e applied with incredible application to forget the whole of his ma&s;ter's le&s;&s;ons, and returned to Ferney at the end of fifteen days, to repeat his part in a new manner before M. de Voltaire, who perceiving a very great change, cried with rapture to Madame Denis, "My Neice, God be prai&s;ed! Cramer has di&s;gorged his Duke!"</P>
<P>For more than thirty years Paris had never beheld a party as &s;trong as that which was for|med to oppo&s;e the fir&s;t repre&s;entation of the tragedy of Ore&s;tes, except indeed, that which was formed again&s;t Adelaide de Gue&s;clan. Ore&s;tes was hi&s;&s;ed from three to eight in the evening. Yet, the be&s;t informed part of the public, who&s;e judgment alone &s;urvives tempo|rary efforts becau&s;e it is impartial, prevailed by degrees over Cr&eacute;billon's zealots, and finally te&s;tified its &s;atisfaction by the mo&s;t un&s;u&s;pect|ed acclamations. It was in one of the&s;e ine|briating moments that Voltaire &s;prang half out of his box, and cried with all his &s;trength, "Go on Athenians! It is Sophocles!"</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="024210_0306_0FC56875D633F5C0">This frankne&s;s and admirable pre&s;ence of mind every hour characterized the only man of whom we have collected any anecdotes. This which follows di&s;plays M. de Voltaire as nature formed him, that is, animated, elo|quent, and ever philo&s;ophic.</P>
<P>In 1743, at the third or fourth repre&s;enta|tion of Merope, M. de Voltaire ob&s;erved a defect in a part of the dialogue. On his re|turn from the Marchione&s;s du Chatelet's hou&s;e, where he had &s;upped, he corrected the faulty part, made a packet of his corrections, and ordered a &s;ervant to carry them to the Sieur Paulin, a very worthy man, but a very mode|rate actor, whom Voltaire had educated, as he u&s;ed to &s;ay, with great care to play his ty|rants. The &s;ervant ob&s;erved to his ma&s;ter that it was pa&s;t midnight, and that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to awaken M. Paulin at that hour. "Away," replied the author of Merope, "tyrants never &s;leep."</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF VOLTAIRE. WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P>I WAS tired of the lazy and turbulent life led at Paris, of the multitude of Petit-Maitres, of bad books printed with the approbation of Cen|&s;ors and the privilege of the King, of the ca|bals and parties among the learned, and of the mean arts, plagiari&s;m, and book-making which di&s;honour literature. In the year 1733, I met with a young lady who happened to think nearly as I did, and who took a re&s;olution to go with me and &s;pend &s;everal years in the country, there to cultivate her under&s;tanding, far from the hurry and tumult of the world.</P>
<P>This Lady was no other than the Marchion|e&s;s de Ch&acirc;telet, who, of all the women in France, had a mind the mo&s;t capable of the different branches of &s;cience. Her father, the Baron de Breteuid, had taught her Latin, which
<PB N="314" REF="024210_0313_0FC5688B24A48228">
&s;he under&s;tood as perfectly as Madame Dacier. She knew by rote the mo&s;t beautiful pa&s;&s;ages in Horace, Virgil, and Lucretius, and all the philo&s;ophical works of Cicero were familiar to her. Her inclinations were more &s;trongly bent towards the mathematics and metaphy&s;ics than any other &s;tudies, and &s;eldom have there been united in the &s;ame per&s;on &s;o much ju&s;tne&s;s of di&s;cernment, and elegance of ta&s;te, with &s;o ar|dent a de&s;ire of information.</P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding her love of literature, &s;he was not the le&s;s fond of the world, and tho&s;e amu&s;ements which were adapted to her &s;ex and age: &s;he, however, determined to quit them all, and go and bury her&s;elf in an old ruinous chateau, upon the borders of Cham|pagne and Loraine, and &s;ituated in a barren and unhealthy &s;oil. This old chateau &s;he orna|mented, and embelli&s;hed with tolerably pretty gardens; I built a gallery, and formed a very good collection of natural hi&s;tory: add to which, we had a library not badly furni&s;hed.</P>
<P>We were vi&s;ited by &s;everal of the learned, who came to philo&s;ophize in our retreat: among others we had the celebrated K&ouml;enig for two intire years, who has &s;ince died Profe&s;|&s;or at the Hague, and Librarian to her High|ne&s;s the prince&s;s of Orange. Maupertuis came al&s;o, with John Bernouilli; and there it was that Maupetuis, who was born the mo&s;t jealous of all human beings, made me the object of a pa&s;&s;ion which has ever been to him exceedingly dear.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="024210_0314_0FC5688DCD619920">I taught Engli&s;h to Madame du Ch&acirc;telet, who in about three months, under&s;tood it as well as I did, and read Newton, Locke, and Pope, with equal ea&s;e. She learnt Italian likewi&s;e as &s;oon. We read all the works of Ta&s;&s;o and Ario&s;to together, &s;o that when Algarotti came to Cirey, where he fini&s;hed his Neutoniani&s;mo per le Dame, [The Ladies Newton,] he found her &s;ufficiently &s;kilful in his own language to give him &s;ome very excellent information by which he profited. Algarotti was a Venetian, the &s;on of a very rich trade&s;man, and very amiable; he travelled all over Europe, knew a little of every thing, and gave to every thing a grace.</P>
<P>In this our delightful retreat we &s;ought only in&s;truction, and troubled not our&s;elves concern|ing what pa&s;&s;ed in the re&s;t of the world. We long employed all our attention and powers upon Leibnitz, and Newton: Madame du Ch&acirc;|telet attached her&s;elf fir&s;t to Leibnitz, and ex|plained one part of his &s;y&s;tem, in a book exceed|ingly well written, entitled In&s;titutions de Phy&s;ique. She did not &s;eek to decorate philo|&s;ophy with ornaments to which philo&s;ophy is a &s;tranger; &s;uch affectation never was part of her character, which was ma&s;culine and ju&s;t. The properties of her &s;tyle were clearne&s;s, preci&s;ion, and elegance. If it be ever po&s;&s;ible to give the &s;emblance of truth to the ideas of Leibnitz, it will be found in that book: but at pre&s;ent
<PB N="316" REF="024210_0315_0FC5688F47413550">
few people trouble them&s;elves to know how or what Leibnitz thought.</P>
<P>Born with a love of truth, &s;he &s;oon aban|doned &s;y&s;tem, and applied her&s;elf to the di&s;|coveries of the great Newton; &s;he tran&s;lated his whole book on the Principles of the Mathe|matics into French; and when &s;he had after|wards enlarged her knowledge, &s;he added to this book, which &s;o few people under&s;tood, an Algebraical Commentary, which likewi&s;e is not to be under&s;tood by common readers. M. Clairaut, one of our be&s;t Geometricians, has carefully reviewed this Commentary, an edi|tion of it was begun, and it is not to the ho|nour of the age, that it never was fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>At Cirey we cultivated all the arts; it was there I compo&s;ed Alzire, M&eacute;rope, l'Enfant, Prodigue, and Mahomet. For her u&s;e I wrote an E&s;&s;ay on Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, from the age of Charlemagne to the pre&s;ent. I cho&s;e the epocha of Charlemagne, becau&s;e it was the point of time which Bou&s;&s;uet &s;topped at, and becau&s;e I dur&s;t not again treat a &s;ubject alrea|dy handled by &s;o great a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Madame du Ch&agrave;telet, however, was far from &s;atisfied with the Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory of this prelate; &s;he thought it eloquent only, and was provoked to find that the labours of Bo&s;|&s;uet were all wa&s;ted upon a nation &s;o de&s;pica|ble as the Jewi&s;h.</P>
<P>After having &s;pent &s;ix years in this retreat, in the mid&s;t of the arts and &s;ciences, we were
<PB N="317" REF="024210_0316_0FC56890B2780758">
obliged to go to Bru&s;&s;els, where the family of du Ch&acirc;telet had long been embroiled in a law|&s;uit with the family of Hon&s;brouk.</P>
<P>Here I had the good fortune to meet with a grand&s;on of the illu&s;trious and unfortunate Grand Pen&s;ioner De Wit, who was Fir&s;t Pre|&s;ident of the Chamber of Accounts, and had one of the fine&s;t libraries in Europe, which was of great u&s;e to me in writing my Univer|&s;al Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>But I had a &s;till &s;uperior happine&s;s at Bru&s;|&s;els, and which gave me infinite plea&s;ure. I terminated the law-&s;uit, by an accommodation, in which the two families had been ruining each other with expences for near &s;ixty years, and gained two hundred and twenty thou&s;and livres paid in ready money to the Marquis du Ch&acirc;telet.</P>
<P>While I remained at Bru&s;&s;els, and in the year 1740, the unpoli&s;hed King of Pru&s;&s;ia, Frederic-William, the mo&s;t intolerant of all Kings, and beyond contradiction the mo&s;t fru|gal, and the riche&s;t in ready money, died at Berlin. His &s;on, who has &s;ince gained &s;o &s;in|gular a kind of reputation, had then held a tolerable regular corre&s;pondence with me above four years. The world never perhaps beheld a father and &s;on who le&s;s re&s;embled each other than the&s;e two monarchs.</P>
<P>The father was an ab&s;olute Vandel, who thought of no other thing, during his whole reign, than a ma&s;&s;ing of money, and maintain|ing, at the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible expence, the fine&s;t
<PB N="318" REF="024210_0317_0FC5689847144950">
&s;oldiers in Europe. Never were &s;ubjects poor|er, or King more rich. He bought up at a de&s;picable price the e&s;tates of a great part of the Nobility, who &s;oon devoured the little money they got for them, above half of which returned to the Royal coffers by means of du|ties upon con&s;umption. All the King's lands were farmed out to tax-gatherers, who held the double office of Exci&s;eman and Judge; in|&s;omuch, that if a landed tenant did not pay this collector upon the very day appointed, he put on his Judge's robe, and condemned the delin|quent in double the &s;um. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erv|ed, that if this &s;ame Exci&s;eman and Judge did not pay the King by the la&s;t day of the month, the day following he was him&s;elf oblig|ed to pay double to the King.</P>
<P>Did a man kill a hare or lop a tree any where near the Royal domains, or commit any other peccadillo? he was in&s;tantly condemned to pay a fine. Was a poor girl found guilty of making a child? the father or the mother, or &s;ome other of the girl's relations, were oblig|ed to pay his Maje&s;ty for the fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>The Baronne&s;s of Kniphau&s;&s;en, who at that time was the riche&s;t widow in Berlin, that is to &s;ay, &s;he had between three and four hun|dred a year, was accu&s;ed of having brought one of the King's &s;ubjects clande&s;tinely into the world in the &s;econd year of her widowhood. His Maje&s;ty thereupon wrote her a letter, with his own hand, wherein he informed her it was
<PB N="319" REF="024210_0318_0FC56899D5256BF0">
nece&s;&s;ary, if &s;he meant to &s;ave her honour, and pre&s;erve her character, &s;he mu&s;t immedi|ately &s;end him thirty thou&s;and livres (1250 l.) This &s;um &s;he was obliged to borrow, and was ruined.</P>
<P>He had an Amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, who&s;e name was Lui&s;ius; and certainly of all the Amba&s;&s;adors that appertained to royalty, he was paid the wor&s;t. This poor man, that he might be able to keep a fire, had cut down &s;ome trees in the garden of Hous-lardick, which then appertained to the Royal-hou&s;e of Pru&s;&s;ia. His next di&s;patches brought him word that the King, his gracious Sovereign, had &s;topped on this account, a year's &s;alary to defray his damages, and Lui&s;ius, in a fit of de&s;pair, cut his throat with the only razor he had. An old valet, happening to come in, called a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and unhappy for him &s;aved his life. I afterwards met with his Excellency at the Hague, and gave him alms at the gate of the Palace, which is called the Old Court, and which belonged to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, where this poor Amba&s;&s;ador had lived twelve years.</P>
<P>Turkey, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, is a Republic, when compared to the de&s;poti&s;m exerci&s;ed by this Frederick-William.</P>
<P>It was by &s;uch like means, only, that he could, in a reign of twenty-eight years, load the cellers of his Palace at Berlin with a hun|dred and twenty millions of crowns (fifteen
<PB N="320" REF="024210_0319_0FC5689CA3DDAFB8">
millions &s;terling) all well ca&s;ked up in barrels, hooped with iron.</P>
<P>He took great plea&s;ure in furni&s;hing the grand apartment of the Palace whith heavy articles of ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver, in which the worth of the workman &s;urpa&s;&s;ed not the &s;terling of na|ture. He gave to the Queen his wife, in charge, that is, a cabinet, the contents of which, even to the coffee-pot, were all gold.</P>
<P>The Monarch u&s;ed to walk from his Palace cloathed in an old blue coat, with copper but|tons, half way down his thighs, and when he bought a new one, the&s;e buttons were made to &s;erve again. It was in this dre&s;s that his Maje&s;ty, armed with a huge &s;erjeant's cane, marched forth every day to review his regi|ment of giants. The&s;e giants were his great|e&s;t delight, and the things for which he went to the heavie&s;t expence.</P>
<P>The men who &s;tood in the fir&s;t rank of this regiment were none of them le&s;s than &s;even feet high, and he &s;ent to purcha&s;e them from the farther parts of Europe to the borders of A&s;ia. I have &s;een &s;ome of them &s;ince his death.</P>
<P>The King, his &s;on, who loved hand&s;ome, and not gigantic men, had given tho&s;e I &s;aw to the Queen, his wife, to &s;erve in quality of Heiduques. I remember they accompanied the old &s;tate coach, which preceded the Mar|quis de Beauvan, who came to compliment the new King in the month of November, 1740. The late King Frederic-William, who
<PB N="321" REF="024210_0320_0FC5689D769B0100">
had formerly fold all the magnificent furniture left by his father, never could find a purcha&s;er for that enormous unguilt coach. The Hei|duques, who walked on each &s;ide to &s;upport it, in ca&s;e it &s;hould fall, &s;hook hands with each other over the roof.</P>
<P>After Frederic-William had reviewed his giants, he u&s;ed to walk through the town, and every body fled before him full &s;peed. If he happened to meet a woman, he would demand why &s;he &s;taid idling her time in the &s;treets, and exclaim, "Go&mdash;get home with you, you lazy hu&s;&s;y; an hone&s;t woman has no bu&s;ine&s;s over the thre&s;hold of her own door;" which remon&s;trance he would accompany with a hearty box on the ear, kick in the groin, or a few well applied &s;trokes on thee &s;houlders with his cane.</P>
<P>The holy Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel were treat|ed al&s;o in exactly the &s;ame &s;tyle, if they hap|pened to take a fancy to come upon the parade.</P>
<P>We may ea&s;ily imagine, what would be the a&s;toni&s;hment and vexation of a Vandal, like this, to find he had a &s;on endowed with wit, grace, and good breeding; who delighted to plea&s;e, was eager in the acqui&s;ition of know|ledge, and who made ver&s;es, and afterwards &s;et them to mu&s;ic. If he caught him with a book in his hand, he threw it into the fire; or playing on the flute, he broke his in&s;trument; and &s;ometimes treated his Royal Highne&s;s, as
<PB N="322" REF="024210_0321_0FC5689F194F4750">
he treated the ladies and the preachers when he met with them on the parade.</P>
<P>The Prince, weary of the attentions of &s;o kind a father, determined one &s;ine morning, in 1730, to elope, without well knowing whe|ther he would fly to France or England. Paternal economy had deprived him of the power of travelling in the &s;tyle of &s;on and heir to a farmer-general, or even an Engli&s;h trade&s;|man, and he was obliged to borrow a few hundred ducats.</P>
<P>Two young gentlemen, both very amiable, one named Kat, the other Keit, were to ac|company him. Kat was the only &s;on of a brave General Officer, and Keit had married the daughter of the &s;aid Barone&s;s of Kniphau&s;|&s;en, who had paid the ten thou&s;and crowns about the child-making bu&s;ine&s;s before men|tioned. The day and hour were appointed; the father was informed of the whole affair, and the Prince and his two travelling compa|nions were all three put under arre&s;t.</P>
<P>The King believed at fir&s;t, that the Prince&s;s Wilhelmina, his daughter, who was afterwards married to the Prince Margrave of Bareith, was concerned in the plot: and as he was remark|able for di&s;patch in the executive branch of ju&s;|tice, he proceeded to kick her out of a large window, which opened from the floor to the cieling. The Queen-Mother, who was pre|&s;ent at this exploit, with great difficulty &s;aved her, by catching hold of her petticoats at the
<PB N="323" REF="024210_0322_0FC568A0743C4C98">
moment &s;he was making her leap. The Prin|ce&s;s received a contu&s;ion on her left brea&s;t, which remained with her during life, as a mark of paternal affection, and which &s;he did me the honour to &s;hew me.</P>
<P>The Prince had a &s;ort of mi&s;tre&s;s, the daugh|ter of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, of the town of Brande|bourg, who had &s;ettled at Potzdam. This girl played tolerably well upon the harp&s;icord, and the Prince accompanied her with his flute. He really imagined him&s;elf in love, but in this he was deceived; his avocation was not with the fair &s;ex. However, as he had pretended a kind of pa&s;&s;ion, the King, his father, thought proper that the dam&s;el &s;hould make the tour of Potzdam, conducted by the hangman, and ordered her to be whipped in pre&s;ence of his &s;on.</P>
<P>After he had regaled him with this diverting &s;pectacle, he made a transfer of him to the citadel of Cu&s;trin, which was &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of a mar&s;h. Here he was &s;hut up, with|out a &s;ingle &s;ervant, for the &s;pace of &s;ix months, in a &s;ort of dungeon, at the end of which time he was allowed a &s;oldier as an attendant.</P>
<P>This &s;oldier, who was young, well made, hand&s;ome, and played upon the flute, had more ways than one of amu&s;ing the royal pri|&s;oner. So many fine qualities have made his fortune; and I have &s;ince known him, at once Valet de Chambre and fir&s;t Mini&s;ter, with all the in&s;olence which two &s;uch po&s;ts may be &s;uppo&s;ed to in&s;pire.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="024210_0323_0FC568A5AC87C7C0">The Prince had been &s;ome weeks in his pa|lace at Cu&s;trin, when one day an old officer, followed by four grenadiers, entered his cham|ber, weeping. Frederic had no doubt he was going to be made a head &s;horter; but the officer &s;till in tears, ordered the grenadiers to take him to the window, and hold his head out of it, that he might be obliged to look on the execution of his friend Kat, upon a &s;caf|fold expre&s;sly built there for that purpo&s;e. He &s;aw, &s;tretched out his hand, and fainted. The father was pre&s;ent at this exhibition, as he had been at that of the girl's whipping-bout.</P>
<P>Keit, the other confidant, had fled into Holland, whither the King di&s;patched his mi|litary me&s;&s;engers to &s;eize him. He e&s;caped merely by a minute, embarked for Portugal, and there remained till the death of the mo&s;t clement Frederic-William.</P>
<P>It was not the King's intention to have &s;top|ped there; his de&s;ign was to have beheaded the Prince. He con&s;idered that he had three other &s;ons, not one of whom wrote ver&s;es, and that they were &s;ufficient to &s;u&s;tain the Pru&s;&s;ian grandeur.

<P>It is not exceedingly clear, from any known laws, human or divine, that a young man &s;hould have his head &s;truck off, becau&s;e he had a wi&s;h to travel. But his maje&s;ty had

found judges in Pru&s;&s;ia, equally as learned and equitable as the Ru&s;&s;ian expounders of law. Be&s;ides that his own paternal authority, in a ca&s;e of need, would at any time &s;uffice.</P>
<P>The Emperor Charles the Sixth, however, pretended that the Prince Royal, as a Prince of the Empire, could not &s;uffer condemnation but in a full Diet; and &s;ent the Count de Se|kendorf to the father, in order to make very &s;erious remon&s;trances on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The Count de Sekendorf, whom I have &s;ince known in Saxony, where he lives re|tired, has declared to me, it was with great difficulty indeed, that he could prevail with the King not to behead the Prince. This is the &s;ame Sekendorf who has commanded the armies of Bavaria, and of whom the Prince, when he came to the throne, drew a hideous portrait, in the hi&s;tory of his father, which he in&s;erted in &s;ome thirty copies of his Memoires dc Brandebourg<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I gave the Elector Palatine the copy of this work, which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia pre&s;ented to me.</NOTE>. Who would not, after this, &s;erve Princes, and prevent tyrants from cut|ting off their heads?</P>
<P>After eighteen months impri&s;onment, the &s;olicitations of the Emperor, and the tears of the Queen, obtained the Prince his liberty; and he immediately began to make ver&s;es, and write mu&s;ic more than ever. He read
<PB N="326" REF="024210_0325_0FC568A7F7DB54E8">
Leibnitz, and even Wolf, whom he called a compiler of tra&s;h, and devoted him&s;elf to the whole circle of &s;ciences at once.</P>
<P>As the King, his father, &s;uffered him to have very little to do with the national affairs, or as there rather, indeed, were no &s;uch af|fairs in a government the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of which was reviews, he emyloyed his lei&s;ure in writing to tho&s;e men of letters in France, who were &s;omething known in the world. The&s;e letters were &s;ome in ver&s;e, and others were treati&s;es of metaphy&s;ics, hi&s;tory, and politics. He treated me as a &s;omething divine, and I him as a Solomon. Epithets co&s;t us nothing. They have printed &s;ome of the&s;e ridiculous things in a collection of my works, and happily they have not printed the thirtieth part of them. I took the liberty to &s;end him an exceedingly beautiful ink-&s;tand; he had the bounty to pre&s;ent me with a few gew-gaws of amber, and all the wits of the Pari&s;ian coffee-hou&s;es imagined with horror my fortune was made.</P>
<P>A young Courlander, named Keizerling, who was likewi&s;e a rhymer, and of cour&s;e a favourite with Frederic, was di&s;patched from the frontiers of Pomerania to us at Cirey. We prepared a fea&s;t for him, and I made a fine illumination, the lights of which compo&s;ed the cypher, and name of the Prince Royal, with this device, l'E&s;perance du genre humain:&mdash; "The hope of all nations."</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="024210_0326_0FC568ABF434FD80">For my own part, had I been inclined to in|dulge per&s;onal hopes, I had great rea&s;on &s;o to do; for my Prince always called me his dear friend, in his letters, and &s;poke frequently of the &s;olid marks of friend&s;hip which he de&s;ign|ed for me as &s;oon as he &s;hould mount the throne.</P>
<P>The throne at la&s;t was mounted, while I was at Bru&s;&s;els, and he began his reign by &s;ending an Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary to France; one Camas, who had lo&s;t an arm, formerly a French refugee, and then an officer in the Pru&s;&s;ian ar|my. He &s;aid that, as there was a mini&s;ter from the French court at Berlin, who had but one hand, he, that he might acquit him&s;elf of all obligation towards the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, had &s;ent him an Amba&s;&s;ador with only one arm.</P>
<P>Camas, as &s;oon as he arrived &s;afe at his inn, di&s;patched a lad to me, whom he had created his page, to tell me that he was too much fati|gued to come to my hou&s;e, and therefore beg|ged I would come to him in&s;tantly, he having the fine&s;t, greate&s;t, and mo&s;t magnificent pre|&s;ent that ever was pre&s;ented, to make me on the part of the King his ma&s;ter.

<P>My Solomon was then at Stra&s;bourg; the whim had taken him while he was vi&s;iting his long and narrow land, which extends from Guel|ders to the Baltic ocean, that he would come incognito to view the frontiers and troops of France. This plea&s;ure he enjoyed at Stra&s;|bourg, where he went by the name of Count du Four, a Lord of Bohemia. His brother, the Prince Royal, who was with him, had al&s;o his travelling title; and Algaroti, who already had attached him&s;elf to him, was the only one who went unma&s;ked.</P>

we may &s;ee by this letter, that he was not yet, become the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible poets, and that his philo&s;ophy did not look with total indiffer|ence on the metal of which his father had made &s;uch ample provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>From Stra&s;burg he went to vi&s;it his territories in the Lower Germany, and &s;ent me word he would come incognito to &s;ee me at Bru&s;&s;els. We prepared elegant apartments for him in the little Chateau de Meau&s;e, two leagues from Cleves. He informed me, he expected I &s;hould make the fir&s;t advances, and accordingly I went to pay him my mo&s;t profound re&s;pects.</P>
<P>Maupertius, who had already formed his plan, having the mania of becoming Pre&s;ident of an Academy upon him, had pre&s;ented him|&s;elf, and was lodged with Algaroti and Keizer|ling in one of the garrets of this palace. One &s;oldier was the only guard I &s;ound. The Privy-Coun&s;ellor and Mini&s;ter of State, Rambonet, was walking in the court-yard, blowing his fin|gers. He had on a pair of large dirty coar&s;e ruffles, a bat, all in holes, and an old judge's wig, one &s;ide of which hung into his pocket, and the
<PB N="331" REF="024210_0330_0FC568B673733808">
other &s;carcely touched his &s;houlder. They in|formed me, this man was charged with a &s;tate affair of great importance, and &s;o indeed he was.</P>
<P>I was conducted into his Maje&s;ty's apart|ment, in which I found nothing but four bare walls. By the light of a bougie, I perceived a &s;mall truckle bed, two feet and a half wide, in a clo&s;et, upon which lay a little man, wrap|ped up in a morning gown of blue cloth. It was his Maje&s;ty, who lay &s;weating and &s;hak|ing, beneath a beggarly coverlet, in a violent ague fit. I made my bow, and began my ac|quaintance by feeling his pul&s;e, as if I had been his fir&s;t phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>The fit left him, and he ro&s;e, dre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf, and &s;at down to table with Algaroti, Ke|zerling, Maupertius, the Amba&s;&s;ador to the States General, and my&s;elf; where at &s;upper, we treated mo&s;t profoundly on the immortality of the &s;oul, natural liberty, and the Androgy|nes of Plato.</P>
<P>While we were thus philo&s;ophizing upon freedom, the Prevy-Coun&s;ellor Rambonet, was mounted upon a po&s;t-hor&s;e, and riding all night towards Liege, at the gates of which he arrived the next day, where he proclaimed, with &s;ound of trumpet, the name of the King his ma&s;ter, while two thou&s;and &s;oldiers from Ve&s;el were laying the city of Liege under con|tribution. The pretext for this fine expedi|tion was certain rights, which his Maje&s;ty pre|tended
<PB N="332" REF="024210_0331_0FC568B873BA2C18">
to have over a part of the &s;uburbs. It was to me he committed the ta&s;k of drawing up the manife&s;to, which I performed as well as the nature of the ca&s;e would let me; never &s;u&s;pecting that a King, with whom I &s;upped, and who called me his friend, could po&s;&s;ibly be in the wrong. The affair was &s;oon brought to a conclu&s;ion, by the payment of a million of livres, which he exacted in good hard du|cats, and which &s;erved to defray the expences of his tour to Stra&s;bourg, concerning which he complained &s;o loudly in his poetic pro&s;e epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>I &s;oon felt my attachment to him, for he had wit, an agreeable manner, and was more|over, a King; which is a circum&s;tance of &s;eduction hardly to be vanqui&s;hed by human weakne&s;s. Generally &s;peaking, it is the employ|ment of men of letters to flatter Kings; but in this in&s;tance, I was prai&s;ed by a King, from the crown of my head to the &s;ole of my foot, at the &s;ame time that I was libelled, at lea&s;t once a week, by the Abb&eacute; Des Fontaines, and other Grub &s;treet poets of Paris.</P>
<P>Some time before the death of his father, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia thought proper to write again&s;t the principles of Machiavel. Had Ma|chiavel had a Prince for a pupil, the very fir&s;t thing he would have advi&s;ed him to do, would have been &s;o to write. The Prince Royal, how|ever, was not ma&s;ter of &s;o much fine&s;&s;e; he re|ally meant what he wrote; but it was before
<PB N="333" REF="024210_0332_0FC568BDCCD049E8">
he was a King, and while his father gave him no great rea&s;on to fall in love with de&s;potic power. He prai&s;ed moderation and ju&s;tice with his whole &s;oul; and in the ardour of his enthu&s;ia&s;m, looked upon all u&s;urpation as an ab&s;olute crime.</P>
<P>This manu&s;cript he had &s;ent to me at Bru&s;&s;els, to have it corrected and printed; and I had al|ready made a pre&s;ent of it to a Dutch book|&s;eller, one Venduren, one of the greate&s;t knaves of his profe&s;&s;ion. I could not help feeling &s;ome remor&s;e, at being concerned in printing this Anti-Machiavelion book, at the very moment the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who had a hundred millions in his coffers, was robbing the poor people at Liege of another, by the hands of the Privy-Coun&s;ellor Rambonet.</P>
<P>I imagined my Solomon would not &s;top there. His father had left him &s;ixty-&s;ix thou&s;and four hundred men, all complete, and excellent troops. He was bu&s;ily augmenting them, and appeared to have a va&s;t inclination to give them employment the very fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>I repre&s;ented to him, that perhaps it was not altogether prudent to print his book ju&s;t at the time the world might reproach him with having violated the principles he taught; and he permitted me to &s;top the impre&s;&s;ion. I ac|cordingly took a journey into Holland, purpo&s;e|ly to do him this trifling &s;ervice; but the book|&s;eller demanded &s;o much money, that his Maje&s;ty, who was not, in the bottom of his
<PB N="334" REF="024210_0333_0FC568C0CB4642D0">
heart, vexed to &s;ee him&s;elf in print, was bet|ter plea&s;ed to be &s;o for nothing, than to pay for not being &s;o.</P>
<P>While I was in Holland, occupied in this bu&s;ine&s;s, Charles the Sixth died, in the month of October, 1740, of an indige&s;tion, occa&s;ioned by eating champignons, which brought on an apoplexy, and this plate of champignons chan|ged the de&s;tiny of Europe. It was pre&s;ent|ly evident, that Frederic the third, King of Pru&s;|&s;ia, was not &s;o great an enemy to Machiavel as the Prince Royal appeared to have been.</P>
<P>Although he had then conceived the project of his inva&s;ion of Sile&s;ia, he did not the le&s;s neglect to invite me to his court; but I had before given him to under&s;tand I could not come to &s;tay with him; that I deemed it a duty to prefer friend&s;hip to ambition; that I was attached to Madame du Ch&acirc;telet; and that, between philo&s;ophers, I loved a lady bet|ter than a King. He approved of the liberty I took, though for his own part he did not love the Ladies. I went to pay him a vi&s;it in Octo|ber; and the Cardinal de Fleury writ me a long letter, full of prai&s;es of the Anti-Machia|vel, and of the author, which I did not forget to let him &s;ee.</P>
<P>He had already a&s;&s;embled his troops, yet not one of his Generals or Mini&s;ters could pe|netrate into his de&s;igns. The Marquis de Beau|veau, who was &s;ent to compliment him on his
<PB N="335" REF="024210_0334_0FC568C2326473A0">
acce&s;&s;ion, believed he meant to declare again&s;t France, in favour of Maria-There&s;a, Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, and daughter of Charles the Sixth; and to &s;upport the election of Francis of Lorraine, Grand Duke of Tu&s;ca|ny, and hu&s;band of that Queen, to the Em|pire, &s;uppo&s;ing he might thence derive great advantages.</P>
<P>I had more rea&s;on than any per&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, the new-crowned King of Pru&s;&s;ia meant to e&s;|pou&s;e this party; for three months before, he had &s;ent me a political di&s;&s;ertation, after his manner wherein he con&s;idered France as the natural enemy and depredator of Germany. But it was con&s;titutional with him to do the direct contrary of what he &s;aid or wrote; not from di&s;&s;imulation, but becau&s;e he &s;poke and wrote with one kind of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and afterwards acted with another.</P>
<P>He departed on the 15th of December, with the quartan ague, for the conque&s;t of Sile&s;ia, at the head of thirty thou&s;and combatants, well di&s;ciplined, and well accoutred. As he mount|ed his hor&s;e, he &s;aid to the Marquis de Beau|vau, Maria There&s;a's Mini&s;ter, "I am going to play your game; &s;hould the trumps fall in|to our hands, we will divide the winnings."</P>
<P>He has &s;ince that written the hi&s;tory of that conque&s;t, and he &s;hewed me the whole of it. Here follows one of the curious paragraphs, in the introduction to the&s;e annals, which I, in preference, carefully tran&s;cribed, as a thing unique in its kind.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="024210_0335_0FC568C452D912C0">"Add to the foregoing con&s;iderations, I had troops entirely prepared to act; this, the fulne&s;s of my trea&s;ury, and the vivacity of my character, were the rea&s;ons why I made war upon Maria-There&s;a, Queen of Bohemia and Hungary."</P>
<P>And a few lines after, he has the&s;e very words.</P>
<P>"Ambition, intere&s;t, and a de&s;ire to make the world &s;peak of me, vanqui&s;hed all, and war was determined on."</P>
<P>From the time that conquerors, or fiery &s;pirits that would be conquerors, fir&s;t were, to the pre&s;ent hour, I believe he is the only one who has ever done him&s;elf thus much ju&s;|tice. Never man, perhaps, felt rea&s;on more forcibly, or li&s;tened more attentively to his pa&s;&s;ions; but this mixture of a philo&s;ophic mind, and a di&s;orderly imagination, have ever compo&s;ed his character.</P>
<P>It is much to be regretted that I prevailed on him to omit the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, when I after|wards corrected his works; a confe&s;&s;ion &s;o uncommon, &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed down to po&s;|terity, and have &s;erved to &s;hew upon what motives the generality of wars are founded.</P>
<P>We authors, poets, hi&s;torians, and acade|mician declaimers, celebrate the&s;e fine ex|ploits; but here is a monarch who performs and condemns them.</P>
<P>His troops had already entered Sile&s;ia, when his Mini&s;ter at Vienna, the Baron de Gotter,
<PB N="337" REF="024210_0336_0FC568C76523C448">
made the very impolite propo&s;al to Maria-There&s;a, of ceding, with a good grace, to the Elector and King his ma&s;ter, three-fourths of that province: for which his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty would lend her three millions of crowns, and make her hu&s;band Emperor.</P>
<P>Maria-There&s;a, who at that time had neither troops, money, nor credit, was notwith&s;tand|ing inflexible; &s;he rather cho&s;e to ri&s;k the lo&s;s of all, than crouch to a Prince whom &s;he looked upon as the va&s;&s;al of her ance&s;tors, and who&s;e life the Emperor, her father, had &s;aved. Her Generals could &s;carcely mu&s;ter twenty thou&s;and men. Mar&s;hal Neuperg, who commanded them, forced the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to give bat|tle under the walls of Nei&s;&s;e. The Pru&s;&s;ian cavalry was at fir&s;t put to the rout by the Au&s;|trian; and the King, who was not accu&s;tomed to &s;tand fire, fled at the fir&s;t &s;hock as far as Opeleim, twelve long leagues from the field of battle.</P>
<P>Maupertuis, who hoped to make his fortune in a hurry, was in the &s;uit of the Monarch this campaign, imagining that the King would at lea&s;t find him a hor&s;e. But this was not the royal cu&s;tom. Maupertuis bought an a&s;s for two ducats, on the day of battle, and fled with all his might after his Maje&s;ty on a&s;s-back. This &s;teed, however, was pre&s;ently di&s;tanced, and Maupertuis was taken and &s;tripped by the Au&s;trian hu&s;&s;ars.</P>
<P>Frederic pa&s;&s;ed the night on a truckle-bed,
<PB N="338" REF="024210_0337_0FC568CA8DC03BB0">
in a village alehou&s;e near Ratibor, on the con|fines of Poland, whence he was preparing to enter the northern part of his own dominions, when one of his hor&s;emen arrived from the camp at Molwitz, and informed him he had gained the victory. This news was confirmed a quarter of an hour after by an Aid-de-Camp, and was true enough.</P>
<P>If the Pru&s;&s;ian cavalry was bad, the infan|try was the be&s;t in Europe; it had been under the di&s;cipline of the old Prince of Anhalt for thirty years. Mar&s;hal Schwerin, who com|manded, was a pupil of Charles the Twelfth. He turned the fate of the day as &s;oon as the King was fled. The next day his Maje&s;ty came back to his army, and the conquering General was very near being di&s;graced.</P>
<P>I returned to philo&s;ophize in my retreat at Cirey, and pa&s;&s;ed the winter at Paris, where I had a multitude of enemies; for, having long before written the Hi&s;tory of Charles XII. pre&s;ented &s;everal &s;ucce&s;sful pieces to the thea|tre, and compo&s;ed an epic poem, I had, of cour&s;e, all tho&s;e who write either in ver&s;e or pro&s;e as per&s;ecutors; and as I had the audacity to write likewi&s;e on philo&s;ophic &s;ubjects, I of nece&s;&s;ity, according to ancient u&s;age, was treated as an athei&s;t by all tho&s;e who are called devotees.</P>
<P>I was the fir&s;t who dared develop to my countrymen, in an intelligible &s;tyle, the di&s;|coveries of the great Newton. The Carte&s;ian
<PB N="339" REF="024210_0338_0FC568CBF30A40F0">
prejudices, which had taken place of the pre|judice of the Peripatetics, were at that time &s;o rooted in the minds of the French, that the Chancellor d' Ague&s;&s;eau regarded any man whatever who &s;hould adopt di&s;coveries made in England, as an enemy to rea&s;on and the &s;tate. He never would grant a privilege that I might have my Elements of the Newtonian Philo&s;ophy printed.</P>
<P>I was likewi&s;e a va&s;t admirer of Locke; I con&s;idered him as the &s;ole rea&s;onable Metaphy|&s;ician. Above all, I prai&s;ed that moderation &s;o new, &s;o prudent, and at the &s;ame time &s;o daring, where he &s;ays, we have not &s;ufficient knowledge to determine or affirm, by the light of rea&s;on, that God could not grant the gifts of thought and &s;en&s;ation to a being which we call Material.</P>
<P>The ob&s;tinate malignity and intrepidity of ignorance, with which they &s;et upon me on this article, cannot be conceived. The prin|ciples of Locke had never occa&s;ioned any di&s;|putes in France before, becau&s;e the Doctors read St. Thomas Aquinas and Qu&ecirc;nel, and the re&s;t of the world read Romances. As &s;oon as I had prai&s;ed this Author, they began to cry out again&s;t both him and me. The poor crea|tures, who were hotte&s;t in this di&s;pute, cer|tainly knew very little of either matter or &s;pi|rit. The fact is, we none of us know what or how we are, except that we are convinced we have motion, life, &s;en&s;ation, and thought,

<P>CARDINAL de Fleury died the twenty-ninth of February, 1743, at the age of ninety. Never did man come to be Prime-Mini&s;ter la|ter in life, and never did Prime-Mini&s;ter keep his place &s;o long. He began his career of good fortune at the age of &s;eventy-three, by being King of France; and &s;o he continued, indi&s;pu|tably, to the day of his death, always affecting the greate&s;t mode&s;ty, never ama&s;&s;ing riches, and without pomp, forming him&s;elf only to reign. He left the reputation of an artful and amiable per&s;on, rather than that of a man of genius, and was &s;aid to have known the in|trigues of a court, better than the affairs of Europe.</P>
<P>I have often &s;een him at the hou&s;e of Madam de Villeroi, when he was only the ancient
<PB N="345" REF="024210_0344_0FC568DBBAB5D8A0">
Bi&s;hop of the little paltry town of Frejus, of which he was always called Bi&s;hop by divine indignation, as may be &s;een in &s;ome of his let|ters. Madame de Villeroi was an exceedingly ugly woman, whom he repudiated as &s;oon as ever it was convenient. The Mar&s;hal de Vil|leroi, her hu&s;band, who knew not the Bi&s;hop had long been the lover of his lady, prevailed on Louis XIV. to name him Prceptor to Louis XV. From Preceptor he became Prime-Mi|ni&s;ter, and was not backward in contributing to the exile of his benefactor. Ingratitude ex|cepted, he was a tolerably good man; but, as he had no talents him&s;elf, he took care to drive away all tho&s;e who had, be they of what kind they would.</P>
<P>Several of the Academicians were de&s;irous I &s;hould &s;upply his place in the French Acade|my. It was a&s;ked at the King's &s;upper, who &s;hould pronounce the Cardinal's funeral orati|on at the Academy? His Maje&s;ty replied, it &s;hould be me; the Dutche&s;s of Chateauroux, his Mi&s;tre&s;s would have it &s;o; but the Count de Maurepas, Secretary of State, would not. He was bit with a fooli&s;h rage of quarrelling with all the Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of his Ma&s;ter, and found the effects of his di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>An old idiot, who was Preceptor to the Dauphin, formerly a Theatine Monk, and af|terwards bi&s;hop of Mirepoix, named Boyer, undertook, for con&s;cience-&s;ake, to &s;econd the caprice of M. de Maurepas. This Boyer having
<PB N="346" REF="024210_0345_0FC568DD44FA5A60">
the di&s;po&s;al of the church livings, the King left all the affairs of the Clergy to his manage|ment. This, in his opinion, came under the head of eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters; and he remon|&s;trated that it would be an offence again&s;t God, &s;hould a prophane per&s;on, like me, &s;uc|ceed a Cardinal.</P>
<P>I knew that M. de Maurepas in&s;tigated him to act thus; I therefore went to this Mini&s;ter, and told him, that though the honour of being an Academician was not a very important dig|nity, yet, after having been appointed, it was a di&s;agreeable thing to be excluded. You are upon ill terms with the Dutche&s;s de Chateaur|oux, with whom his Maje&s;ty is in love, and likewi&s;e with the Duke de Richelieu, by whom &s;he is governed; but pray, my Lord, what con|nexion is there between the&s;e di&s;putes of your's, and a poor &s;eat in the French Academy? I conjure you to tell me &s;incerely, in ca&s;e Ma|dame de Chateauroux can vangui&s;h the Bi&s;hop de Mirepoix in this conte&s;t, will you remain neuter? &mdash;He &s;eemed to collect him&s;elf for a moment, and then replied, "No; I &s;hall cru&s;h you."</P>
<P>The Prie&s;t at length conquered the Mi&s;tre&s;s, and I lo&s;t my &s;eat in the Academy, which did not give me much vexation; but I love to re|collect this adventure; it depicts &s;o truly the little arts of tho&s;e whom we call the Great, and &s;hews how really trifles are often con&s;ider|ed by them as very important matters.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="024210_0346_0FC568E3D12FB050">Public affairs, however, went on no better &s;ince the death of the Cardinal, than they had, done during the two la&s;t years of his life. The Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria ro&s;e from its a&s;hes into new life; France was pre&s;&s;ed hard by her and by England; and we had no re&s;ource left but in the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who had led us into this war, and who abandoned us in our nece&s;&s;ity. They conceived the de&s;ign of &s;ending &s;ecretly to &s;ound the intentions of this Monarch, and try if he was not in a humour to prevent the &s;torm, which, &s;oon or late, mu&s;t gather at Vienna, and fall upon him&punc; after having vi&s;it|ed us; to &s;ee therefore if he would not lend us a hundred thou&s;and men on this occa&s;ion, and thus fix him&s;elf more firmly in the Sile&s;ian conque&s;t.</P>
<P>The Duke de Richelieu, and the Dutche&s;s de Chateauroux fir&s;t imagined this &s;cheme, the King adapted it, and M. Amelot, Mini&s;ter for Foreign Affairs, but in a very &s;ubaltern &s;itua|ation, was &s;ingly charged to ha&s;ten my depar|ture. A pretext was wanted, and I &s;eized that of my di&s;pute with the old Bi&s;hop of Mi|repoix, which met with his Maje&s;ty's approba|tion. I writ to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, that I could no longer endure the per&s;ecutions of this Theatine Monk; and that I mu&s;t take refuge with a King, who was a philo&s;opher, to e&s;cape the &s;nare of a Bi&s;hop, who was a bigot. This Prelate always &s;igned him&s;elf l'anc, in&s;tead of Pancien, [the ancient] Bi&s;hop of Mirepoix;
<PB N="348" REF="024210_0347_0FC568E591588D40">
and his writing being very bad, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> u&s;ed conti+nually to read and call him the a&s;s of Mirepoix. It was a &s;ubject of plea&s;antry, and never was negociation more gay.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who &s;truck not with a pal&s;ied hand, when the blow was intended for the cheek of a Monk, or a Prelate become courtier, replied with a deluge of &s;arca&s;ms up|on the a&s;s of Mirepoix, and pre&s;&s;ed me to come.</P>
<P>I took great care, that both my letters and the&s;e an&s;wers &s;hould be read. It &s;oon came to the Bi&s;hop's ears, and he went to complain to his Maje&s;ty, that he was laughed at for a fool in a foreign court.</P>
<P>The King's an&s;wer was, it was a matter agreed on, and he mu&s;t let it pa&s;s without notice.</P>
<P>This an&s;wer has very little of the character of Louis XV. in it; and, as coming from him, always appeared to me extraordinary. Thus I had, at once, the plea&s;ure of revenging my|&s;elf upon a Bi&s;hop, who had excluded me from the Academy, of taking a very agreeable jour|ney, and of having an opportunity to exert my&s;elf in the &s;ervice of the King and State. Even the Count de Maurepas entered into this project with warmth, becau&s;e at that time he governed M. Amelot, and con&s;idered him&s;elf, in fact, as the mini&s;ter for foreign affairs.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;ingular part of this bu&s;ine&s;s was, that we were obliged to let Madame du Ch&acirc;|telet

into the &s;ecret. There was not, in her opinion, any thing in the world &s;o unmanly, &s;o abominable, as for a man to leave a woman to go and live with a King; and &s;he would have made a mo&s;t dreadful tumult, had they not agreed, that to appea&s;e her, &s;he &s;hould be informed of the rea&s;on, and that the letters &s;hould all pa&s;s through her hands.</P>
<P>Whatever money I wanted for my journey, was given, upon my mere receipt, by M. de Monmartle, which power I took care not to abu&s;e. I &s;tayed &s;ome time in Holland, while the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was galloping, from one end of his territories to the other, to be pre|&s;ent at reviews, and my &s;tay at the Hague was not u&s;ele&s;s. I had apartments in the Palace de la Vicille Cour, which belonged at that time to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, in participation with the Hou&s;e of Orange. His envoy, the young Count de Padvitz, loved, and was beloved by the lady of one of the principal per&s;ons among their High Mightine&s;&s;es; and he obtained from her, copies of all their &s;ecret re&s;olutions, which at that time, were very prejudicial to the in|tere&s;ts of France. The&s;e copies I &s;ent to our court, and my &s;ervice was found very accept|able.</P>
<P>When I came to Berlin, his Maje&s;ty would lodge me in the Palace, as he had done on my fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mer vi&s;its. He led, at Potzdam, the life he had always led &s;ince his advancement to the throne: the manner of it de&s;erves a de&s;cription.</P>

The Secretaries of State &s;ent all the di&s;patches to the King's Clerk, who brought extracts to his Maje&s;ty, and the King writ his an&s;wer in the margin in two words. The whole affairs of the Kingdom were expedited in an hour, and &s;eldom did the Secretaries of State, or the Mini&s;ters in office, come into his pre&s;ence; nay, there were &s;ome to whom even he had never &s;poken. The King, his father, had put the finances under &s;uch exact regulations, all was executed in &s;uch a military manner, and obedience was &s;o blind, that four hundred leagues were governed with as much ea&s;e as a manor.</P>
<P>About eleven o'clock, the King, booted, reviewed in his garden his regiment of guards; and at the &s;ame hour all the Colonels did the like throughout the provinces, in the interval of parade and dinner-time. The Princes his brothers, the General Officers, and one or two

<P>When dinner was over, he retired to his cabinet, and writ ver&s;es till five or &s;ix o'clock; a young man of the name of Darget, former|ly Secretary to M. de Valory, the French En|voy, then came and read to him. At &s;even he had a little concert, at which he played the flute, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d as well as the be&s;t performers.

<P>They &s;upped in a little hall; the mo&s;t &s;ingu|lar ornament of which was a picture, the de|&s;ign of which he him&s;elf gave to Pene, his paint|er, and one of our be&s;t colouri&s;ts. The &s;ubject was totally Priapian.

The &s;upper was frequently &s;ea&s;oned with the &s;ame kind of philo&s;ophy; and any per&s;on who had h&ecirc;ard the di&s;cour&s;e, and looked at this picture, would have &s;uppo&s;ed they had caught the Se|ven Sages of Greece in a brothel.</P>

How! continued the King, have you dared to preach about Herod, and are ignorant both of him and his family? You are unworthy of the holy mini&s;try.

<P>His poor mi&s;tre&s;s, who had &s;uffered whip|ping for his &s;ake by the hands of the common hangman, was married at Berlin to the Clerk of the Hackney-Coach office; for they had eighteen hackney-coaches at Berlin; and her royal lover, allowed her a pen&s;ion of &s;eventy crowns (eight pounds fifteen &s;hillings) a year. She called her&s;elf Mademoi&s;elle Saumers, and was a tall, meagre figure, very like one of the Sybils, without the lea&s;t appearance of merit|ing to be publicly whipped for a Prince.</P>
<P>When, however, he was at Berlin, he made a great di&s;play of magnificence on public days. It was a &s;uperb &s;pectacle for the vain, that is to &s;ay, for almo&s;t all mankind, to &s;ee him at table, &s;urrounded with twenty Princes of the Empire, &s;erved in ve&s;&s;els of gold, the riche&s;t in Europe, by two and thirty Pages, and as many young Heiduques, all &s;plendidly cloath|ed, and bearing di&s;hes of ma&s;&s;y gold. The State Officers were al&s;o employed on the&s;e occa&s;ions, though unknown at any other time.</P>
<P>After dinner they went to the Opera at the
<PB N="357" REF="024210_0356_0FC568F79D95D658">
large Theatre, three hundred feet long, which had been built without an Architect by one of his Chamberlains, who&s;e name was Knober&s;toff. The fine&s;t voices and be&s;t dancers were engag|ed in his &s;ervice. Barberini at that time dan|ced at his Theatre, the &s;ame who has &s;ince been married to the &s;on of his Chancellor. The King had her carried off by his &s;oldiers from Venice, and brought even through Vienna as far as Berlin. He was a little in love with her, becau&s;e &s;he had legs like a man; but the thing in mo&s;t of all incomprehen&s;ible, was, that he gave her a &s;alary of thirty two thou&s;and livres (above thirteen hundred pounds.) His Italian Poet, who was obliged to put the operas into ver&s;e, of which the King him&s;elf gave the plan, had little more than a thirtieth part of this &s;um; but it ought to be remembered, he was very ugly, and could not dance. In a word, Barb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rini touched for her &s;hare more than any three of his Mini&s;ters of State toge|ther.</P>
<P>As for the Italian Poet, he one day took care to pay him&s;elf with his own hands, for he &s;tript off the gold from the ornaments in an old chapel of the fir&s;t King of Pru&s;&s;ia's; on which occa&s;ion Frederic remarked, that as he never went to the chapel, he had lo&s;t nothing. Be&s;ides, he had lately written a di&s;&s;ertation in favour of thieves, which is printed in the collections of his academy; and he did not think proper this time to contradict his writ|ings by his actions.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="024210_0357_0FC568F8F9DC1688">This indulgence was not extended to any military being. There was on old gentleman of Franche Comt&eacute;, confined in the pri&s;on of Spandau, who was &s;ix feet high, and whom the late King, for that rea&s;on, had inveigled into Pru&s;&s;ia. They promi&s;ed him the place of Chamberlain, and gave him that of foot &s;ol|dier. This poor man &s;oon after de&s;erted with one of his comrades, bat was taken and brought before the late King. He had the &s;implicity to tell him, he repented of nothing but that he had not &s;tabbed &s;uch a tyrant; and for this an&s;wer he had his no&s;e and ears cut off, ran the gauntlet &s;ix and thirty times, and was af|terwards &s;ent to wheel the barrow at Spandau. He continued this employment to the very time that M. de Valory, our Envoy, pre&s;&s;ed me to beg remi&s;&s;ion for him of the mo&s;t clement &s;on of the mo&s;t iron-hearted Frederic-William.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty had been plea&s;ed to &s;ay, it was to oblige me that he had got up an Opera, full of poetical beauties, and written by the cele|brated Mete&s;ta&s;io, called La Clemenza di Tito. The King, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his compo&s;er, had &s;et it to mu&s;ic him&s;elf. I took this op|portunity to recommend the poor old French|man, without no&s;e and ears, to his bounty, which I did in the following admonitory ver&s;es.</P>
<Q><L>What! can it be when mighty Frederic reigns</L>
<L>That wretches groan? Oh! Genius univer&s;al,</L>
<L>Soul firm, jet feeling, deign to end the culprit's</L>

<L>Wherefore di&s;played with &s;uch magnificence</L>
<L>The triumphs of great Titus? Imitate</L>
<L>Him every way, or vaunt of him no more.</L></Q>
<P>The reque&s;t was &s;omething daring, but one may &s;ay what one will poetically. His Maje&s;ty promi&s;ed remi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ome months after even had the bounty to &s;end the poor gentle|man in que&s;tion to the Ho&s;pital, at three pence a day, which favour he had refu&s;ed to the Queen, his mother; but &s;he, in all probability, had a&s;ked only in pro&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all the&s;e fea&s;ts, operas, and &s;uppers, my &s;ecret negociation went forward; the King was willing I &s;hould &s;peak on every thing, and I frequently took occa&s;ion to in|termix que&s;tions concerning France and Au|&s;tria with the Eneid and Roman Hi&s;tory. The conver&s;ation was &s;ometimes animated; the King became warm, and would tell me, that while our Court was knocking at every door to procure peace, he &s;hould not think it ad|vi&s;eable to go to war in our defence. I &s;ent my reflexions upon paper, left half blank, from my apartment to his; and he an&s;wered my daring remarks in the margin. I have this paper &s;till, in which I have &s;aid,</P>

<P>This new kind of negociation fini&s;hed by a di&s;cour&s;e, in which, in one of his moments of vivacity, he made me again&s;t the King of Eng|land, his dear Uncle. The&s;e two Kings did not love one another. My Pru&s;&s;ian Monarch told me, "George was the Uncle of Frederic, but not of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia;" and he ended by &s;aying, "Let France declare war again&s;t England, and I will march."</P>
<P>This was all I wanted. I returned in&s;tant|ly to France, and I gave an account of my jour|ney; with &s;uch hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, to the French Mini&s;try as had been given me at Berlin. Neither were they fal&s;e, for the &s;pring following the King of Pru&s;&s;ia concluded a new treaty with France, and advanced into Bohemi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with a hundred thou&s;and men, while the Au&s;trians were in Al&s;atia.</P>
<P>Had I related my adventure to any good Pa|ri&s;ian, with the &s;ervice I had done the &s;tate, he would not have made the lea&s;t doubt of my ha|ving been promi&s;ed an excellent place. I will tell you what was recompen&s;e. The Dutch|e&s;s de Chateauroux was vexed the negociation had not been brought about entirely by her means; &s;he had likewi&s;e an inclination to have M. Amelot turned out becau&s;e he &s;tuttered
<PB N="361" REF="024210_0360_0FC568FF0ADAFDE0">
which trifling defect &s;he found offen&s;ive, and &s;he farther hated him becau&s;e he was governed by M. de Maurepas; he was accordingly di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed eight days after, and I was included in his di&s;grace.</P>
<P>It happened &s;ome time after this, that Louis XV. fell extremely ill at the City of Metz. This was the time for M. de Maurepas and his ca|bal to ruin the Dutche&s;s de Chateauroux. The Bi&s;hop of Soi&s;&s;ons, Fitz-James, &s;on of the ba&s;t|ard of James II. who was thought a &s;aint, would, in quality of Grand Almoner, convert the King; and declare he would neither grant him ab&s;olution, nor &s;uffer him to communicate, if he did not drive his Mi&s;tre&s;s, with her Si&s;ter the Dutche&s;s of Laurigais, and their friends from court; and the two Si&s;ters in con&s;equence departed, with the execrations of the people of Metz.</P>
<P>This action of Louis XV. was the occa&s;ion that the Pari&s;ians, equally &s;tupid with the good folks of Metz, gave him the &s;urname of Bien-Aim&eacute;, Well beloved. A fellow named Vad&eacute; fir&s;t invented this title, which all the Almanacs echoed. As &s;oon as the Prince recovered, he de&s;ired only to be the well-beloved of his Mi&s;|tre&s;s, for whom he found his affection increa&s;e; and &s;he was again going to undertake her Mi|ni&s;try, when &s;he died &s;uddenly, in con&s;equence of the pa&s;&s;ions into which &s;he had been thrown by her di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. She was pre&s;ently forgot.</P>
<P>A Mi&s;tre&s;s was now wanted, and the choice
<PB N="362" REF="024210_0361_0FC569007938F8B8">
fell upon the Demoi&s;elle Poi&s;&s;on. She was the daughter of a kept woman and a countryman, who lived at La Fert&eacute;&s;ous-Jouare, and who had ama&s;&s;ed &s;ome money by &s;elling wheat to the corn factors. This poor man at that time had ab&s;conded, having been condemned for malver&s;ation, and they had married his daugh|ter to the under Farmer general le Normand, Lord of Etiole, and Nephew of the Farmer-general le Normand, of Tourneham, who kept her mother. The daughter had been well educated, was prudent, amiable, very graceful, had great talents, a fine under&s;tanding, and a good heart.</P>
<P>I was tolerably intimate with her, and was even the confidant of her amours. She con|fe&s;&s;ed to me, &s;he had always had a &s;ecret fore|thought that the King would fall in love with her, and that &s;he had always ardently wi&s;hed he might, without making her wi&s;hes too appa|rent. This idea which &s;eems &s;o chimerical for a per&s;on in her &s;tation, originated from her having been often taken to the royal hunt in the fore&s;t of Senar. Tourneham, her mother's lover, had a country hou&s;e near there, and u&s;ed to take her out to air in a neat Cala&s;h. His Maje&s;ty had ob&s;erved her, and had often &s;ent her veni&s;on. Her mother never cea&s;ed telling her &s;he was hand&s;omer than Madame de Cha|teauroux, and the good man Tourneham con|firmed it in raptures. It mu&s;t be owned, the daughter of Madame Poi&s;&s;on was a mor&s;el for
<PB N="363" REF="024210_0362_0FC56901F75C6CA0">
Maje&s;ty. After &s;he was certain of her Royal Lover, the told me &s;he was firmly per&s;uaded of the doctrine of prede&s;tination, and &s;he had &s;ome cau&s;e &s;o to be. I pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal months with her at Etiole, while the King made the campaign of 1746.</P>
<P>I hence obtained rewards which had never been granted to my works or my &s;ervices. I was deemed worthy to be one of the forty u&s;e|le&s;s Members of the Academy, was appointed Hi&s;toriographer of France, and created by the King one of the Gentlemen in Ordinary of his Chamber. From this I concluded it was better, in order to make the mo&s;t trifling fortune, to &s;peak four words to a King's mi&s;tre&s;s than to write a hundred volumes.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had the appearance of a fortu|nate man, the whole brotherhood of the Beaux-E&s;prits of Paris was let loo&s;e upon me, with all the inveterate animo&s;ity which might be expect|ed from them, again&s;t a per&s;on who obtained tho&s;e benefactions, which they imagined only due to their own merits.</P>
<P>My connexion with Madame du Ch&acirc;telet was never interrupted; our friend&s;hip, and our love of literature, were unalterable; we lived together both in town and out of town. Cirey is &s;ituated upon the borders of Lorraine, and King Stani&s;laus at that time kept his little agreeable court at Luneville. Old and fana|tic as he was, he yet had a friend&s;hip with a lady who was neither. His affections were di|vided between Madame da Marqui&s;e de Bouf|flers,
<PB N="364" REF="024210_0363_0FC56908263CB628">
and a Je&s;uit, who&s;e name was Menou; a Prie&s;t, the mo&s;t daring, the mo&s;t intriguing I have ever known.</P>
<P>This man had drawn from King Stani&s;laus, by means of his Queen, whom he had govern|ed, about a million of livres, (near forty-two thou&s;and pounds) part of which were employ|ed in building a magnificent hou&s;e for him&s;elf and &s;ome Je&s;uits of Nancy. This hou&s;e was endowed with twenty-four thou&s;and livres, or a thou&s;and pounds a year; half of which &s;upplied his table, and the other half was to give away to whom he plea&s;ed.

do every day when he came from ma&s;s to re|concile his mi&s;tre&s;s and his confe&s;&s;or. Our Je&s;uit at la&s;t having heard of Madame du Ch&acirc;|telet, who was exceedingly well &s;haped, and &s;till tolerably hand&s;ome, conceived the project of &s;ub&s;tituting her to Madame de Boufflers.</P>
<P>Stani&s;laus amu&s;ed him&s;elf &s;ometimes in writ|ing little works, which were bad enough, and Menou imagined an authore&s;s would &s;uc|ceed with him as a mi&s;tre&s;s better than any other. With this fine trick in his head he came to Cirey, cajoled Madame du Ch&acirc;telet, and told us how delighted King Stani&s;laus would be in our company. He then returned to the King, and informed him how ardently we de|&s;ired to come and pay our court to his Maje|&s;ty. Stani&s;laus a&s;ked Madame de Boufflers to bring us; and we went to pa&s;s the whole year, 1749, at Luneville. But the projects of the holy Je&s;uit did not &s;ucceed; the very re|ver&s;e took place; we were devoted to Madame de Boufflers, and he had two women to com|bat in&s;tead of one.</P>
<P>The life led at the court of Lorraine was tolerably agreeable; though there, as in other courts, there were plenty of intrigues and artifice.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the year, Poncet, Bi&s;hop of Troyes, who was overwhelmed with debts, and who&s;e reputation was lo&s;t, wi&s;hed to come and augment our intrigues and artifice.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="024210_0365_0FC5690BCF8E3938">When I &s;ay he had lo&s;t his reputation, I mean al&s;o the reputation of his &s;ermons and funeral orations. He obtained, through the intere&s;t of our two ladies, the place of Grand-Almoner to the King, who was flattered by having a Bi&s;hop in his pay, and at very &s;mall wages too. This Prelate did not come till 1750: he began his career by intriguing again&s;t Madame de Boufflers, his benefactre&s;s, and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. His anger alighted on Lewis XV. the &s;on-in-law of Stani&s;laus: being returned to Troyes, he would needs play a part in the ridiculous farce of the confe&s;&s;ional billets, in|vented by Beaumont, Arch bi&s;hop of Paris: he made head again&s;t the parliament, and braved the King. This was not the way to pay his debts, but to get him&s;elf impri&s;oned. Lewis &s;ent him into Al&s;atia, and had him &s;hut up in a convent of fat German Friars.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t return to what concerns my&s;elf. Madame du Ch&acirc;telet died in the palace of Stani&s;laus, after two days illne&s;s; and we were &s;o affected, that not one of us ever re|membered to &s;end for Prie&s;t, Je&s;uit, or any of the Seven Sacraments. It was we, and not Madame du Ch&acirc;telet, who felt the horrors of death. The good King Stani&s;laus came to my chamber, and mixed his tears with mine: few of his brethren would have done &s;o much on a like occa&s;ion. He wi&s;hed me to &s;tay at Lu|neville, but I could no longer &s;upport the place, and returned to Paris.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="024210_0366_0FC5690D55170470">It was my de&s;tiny to run from King to King, although I loved liberty even to idolatry. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, whom I had frequently given to under&s;tand I would never quit Madame du Ch&acirc;telet for him, would ab&s;olutely entrap me, now he was rid of his rival. He enjoyed at that time a peace, which he had purcha&s;ed with victory; and his lei&s;ure hours were always devoted to making ver&s;es, or writing the hi&s;|tory of his country campaigns. He was well convinced, that in reality his ver&s;e and pro&s;e too, were &s;uperior to my ver&s;e and pro&s;e, as to their e&s;&s;ence; though as to the form, he thought there was a certain &s;omething, a turn, that I, in quality of Academician, might give to his writings; and there was no kind of flat|tery, no &s;eduction, he did not employ to en|gage me to come.</P>
<P>Who might re&s;i&s;t a Monarch, a Hero, a Poet, a Mu&s;ician, a Philo&s;opher, who pretend|ed too to love me, and whom I thought I al&s;o loved.

To be lodged in the &s;ame apartments that Mar|&s;hal Saxe had occupied; to have the royal cooks at my command, when I cho&s;e to dine alone; and the royal coachmen, when I had an inclination to ride, were trifling favours.</P>
<P>Our &s;uppers were very agreeable. I know not if I am deceived, but I think we had a deal of wit. The King was witty, and gave
<PB N="368" REF="024210_0367_0FC5690EC7C0C978">
occa&s;ion to wit in others; and what is &s;till more extraordinary, I never found my&s;elf &s;o much at ea&s;e. I worked two hours a day with his Maje&s;ty, corrected his works, and never failed highly to prai&s;e whatever was worthy of prai&s;e, although I rejected the dro&s;s. I gave him details of all that was nece&s;&s;ary in rhetoric and critici&s;m, for his u&s;e; he profit|ed by my advice, and his genius a&s;&s;i&s;ted him more effectually than my le&s;&s;ons.</P>
<P>I had no court to make, no vi&s;its to pay, no duty to fulfil; I led the life of liberty, and had no conception of any thing more happy than my then &s;ituation. My Frederic-Alcina, who &s;aw my brain was already a little di&s;or|dered, redoubled the potions that I might be totally inebriated. The la&s;t &s;eduction was a letter he wrote, and &s;ent from his apartments to mine. A Mi&s;tre&s;s could not have written more tenderly; he laboured in his epi&s;tle to di&s;&s;ipate the fear which his rank and character had in&s;pired; it contained the&s;e remarkable words:</P>
<P>"How is it po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould bring unhappi|ne&s;s on the man I e&s;teem, who has &s;acrificed his country, and all that humanity holds dear, to me?

What &s;lavery, what mi&s;|fortune, what change can be feared, in a place where you are e&s;teemed as much as in your own country, and with a friend who has a grateful heart? I re&s;pected the friend&s;hip that endeared you to Madame du Ch&acirc;telet, but af|ter

her I am one of your olde&s;t friends. I give you my promi&s;e you &s;hall be happy here as long as I live."</P>
<P>Here is a letter, &s;uch as few of their Ma|je&s;ties write: it was the fini&s;hing gla&s;s to com|plete my drunkenne&s;s. His wordy prote&s;tations were &s;till &s;tronger than his written ones. He was accu&s;tomed to very &s;ingular demon&s;trations of tenderne&s;s to younger favourites than I, and forgetting for a moment I was not of their age, and had not a fine hand, he &s;eized it and imprinted a ki&s;s; I took his, returned his &s;a|lute, and &s;igned my&s;elf his &s;lave.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould get permi&s;&s;ion from the King of France to belong to two Ma&s;ters: the King of Pru&s;&s;ia took charge of every thing, and wrote to a&s;k me of Louis. I never ima|gined they were &s;hocked at Ver&s;ailles, that a Gentleman in Ordinary of the Chamber, one of the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s Beings of a Court, &s;hould become a u&s;ele&s;s Chamberlain at Berlin. They granted me full permi&s;&s;ion, but were highly piqued, and did not pardon me. I greatly di&s;plea&s;ed the King of France without plea&s;ing the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who laughed at me in the bottom of his heart.</P>
<P>Behold me then with a &s;ilver key gilt with gold hanging at my button-hole, a cro&s;s round my neck, and twenty thou&s;and livres, or eight hundred guineas a year. Maupertuis fell &s;ick, and yet I did not perceive the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>At that time there was a Phy&s;ician at Berlin,
<PB N="370" REF="024210_0369_0FC5691561D0F3B0">
one La Metrie, who was the mo&s;t frank and declared Athei&s;t of all the medical people of Europe. He was a gay, plea&s;ant, thoughtle&s;s fellow, who knew the theory of phy&s;ic as well as the be&s;t of his brethren, but without con|tradiction the wor&s;t practitioner upon earth, for which rea&s;on he had left the profe&s;&s;ion. He ridiculed the whole faculty of Paris, and had even written many per&s;onalities again&s;t individuals, which they could not pardon; and they obtained a decree again&s;t him, by which a reward was offered for his apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>La Metrie had, in con&s;equence, fled to Ber|lin, where he amu&s;ed him&s;elf &s;ufficiently by his gaiety, and likewi&s;e by writing and print|ing all that can be imagined mo&s;t impudent upon manners; his books plea&s;ed the King, who made him, not his Phy&s;ician, but, his Reader.</P>
<P>One day after the lecture, La Metrie, who &s;poke whatever came uppermo&s;t, told his Ma|je&s;ty there were per&s;ons exceedingly jealous of my favour and fortune.&mdash;"Be quiet a while," &s;aid Frederic, "we &s;queeze the orange, and throw it away when we have &s;wallowed the juice."&mdash;La Metrie, did not forget to repeat to me this fine apophthegm, worthy Diony|&s;ius of Syracu&s;e. From that time I determined to take all po&s;&s;ible care of the orange peel. I had about twelve thou&s;and guineas to place out at intere&s;t, but was determined it &s;hould not be in the territories of my Alcina. I found an advantageous opportunity of lending them

<P>The King, who opened all my letters, did not doubt of my intention to quit his court. The furor of rhyming, however, &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him, as it did Diony&s;ius, I was obliged conti|nually to pore, and again revi&s;e his Hi&s;tory of Brandenbourg, and all the re&s;t of his works.</P>
<P>La Metrie died from having eaten a pa&s;ty &s;tuffed with truffles, after a very hearty dinner at the table of Lord Tyrconnel, Envoy from France, It was pretended he had been con|fe&s;&s;ed before his death. The King was exceed|ingly vexed at this, and took care to be ex|actly informed concerning the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion; they a&s;&s;ured him it was an atrocious calumny, for La Metrie had died as he lived, abjuring God and Phy&s;icians. His Maje&s;ty was convinced, and immediately compo&s;ed his fu|neral oration, which was read, in his name, at a public &s;itting of the Academy, by Darget his Secretary. He &s;ettled five and twenty pounds a year likewi&s;e upon a girl of the town, whom La Metrie had brought from Paris, where he had left his wife and children.</P>
<P>Maupertuis, who knew the anecdote of the orange-peel, took an opportunity to &s;pread a report, that I had &s;aid, the place of King's Athei&s;t was vacant. This calumny did not &s;ucceed; but he afterwards added I had al&s;o &s;aid, the King's poetry was bad; and this an|&s;wered his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="024210_0371_0FC5691B9CF70230">From this time forward, I found the King's &s;uppers were no longer &s;o merry; I had few|er ver&s;es to correct, and my di&s;grace was complete.</P>
<P>Algaroti, Darget, and a Frenchman, who&s;e name was Cha&s;ol, one of the King's be&s;t Offi|cers, left him all at once. I was preparing to do the &s;ame, but I wi&s;hed, before I went, to enjoy the plea&s;ure of laughing at a book Maupertuis had ju&s;t printed. It was the be&s;t of opportunities, for never had any thing ap|peared &s;o ridiculous or ab&s;urd. The good man &s;eriou&s;ly propo&s;ed to travel directly to the two Poles; to di&s;&s;ect the heads of giants, and di&s;|cover the nature of the &s;oul by the texture of the brain; to build a city, and make the in|habitants all &s;peak Latin; to &s;ink a pit in the center of the earth; to cure the &s;ick by plai&s;|tering them over with gum-re&s;in; and, final|ly, to prophe&s;y, by enthu&s;ia&s;tically inflating the fancy.</P>
<P>The King laughed, I laughed, every body laughed at his book; but there was a &s;cene acting at that time of a far more &s;erious nature, concerning I know not what mathematical non&s;ence that Maupertuis wanted to e&s;tabli&s;h as di&s;coveries. A more learned Mathematici|an, Ko&euml;nig, Librarian to the Prince&s;s of Orange at the Hague, &s;hewed him his mi&s;take, and that Leibnitz, who had before time examined that old idea, had demon&s;trated its fal&s;ity in &s;everal of his letters, copies of which he &s;ent Maupertuis.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="024210_0372_0FC5691CF826D508">Maupertuis, Pre&s;ident of the Academy at Berlin, enraged that an a&s;&s;ociate and a &s;tran|ger &s;hould prove his blunders, took care fir&s;t to per&s;uade the King, that Ko&euml;nig, being &s;et|tled in Holland, was of cour&s;e his enemy; and next, that he had &s;aid many di&s;re&s;pectful things of his Maje&s;ty's ver&s;e and pro&s;e to the Prince&s;s of Orange.</P>
<P>This precaution taken, he &s;uborned &s;ome few poor pen&s;ioners of the Academy, his de|pendents, had Ko&euml;nig condemned as a forger, and his name era&s;ed from the number of Aca|demicians. Here however he was anticipated, for Ko&euml;nig had &s;ent back his Patent-Acade|mician-Dignity to Berlin.</P>
<P>All the men of letters in Europe were as full of indignation at the manoeuvres of Mau|pertuis as they were weary of his book, and he obtained the contempt and hatred even of tho&s;e who did not under&s;tand the di&s;pute. They were obliged to content them&s;elves at Berlin with a mere &s;hrug of the &s;houlders; for the King had taken a part in this unfortunate af|fair, no per&s;on dur&s;t &s;peak. I was the only one who &s;poke out.

of them are poor; poverty enervates, and even philo&s;ophers, at court, become as truly &s;laves as the fir&s;t Officer of the Crown. I felt how di&s;plea&s;ing my free &s;pirit mu&s;t be to a King more ab&s;olute than the Grand Turk. He was a plea&s;ant Monarch, in the rece&s;&s;es of his pa|lace, we mu&s;t confe&s;s: he protected Mauper|tuis. and laughed at him more than any one. He writ again&s;t him, and &s;ent his manu&s;cript to my chamber by one Marvitz, a Mini&s;ter of his &s;ecret plea&s;ures; he turned to ridicule the Pit to the center of the earth, the method of cure with Plai&s;ter of gum-re&s;in, the voyage to the South Pole, the Latin city, and the cow|ardice of the Academy, in having &s;uffered the the tyranny exerci&s;ed upon poor Ko&euml;nig. But his motto was, "No clamour when I don't cry;" and he had every thing burnt that had been written upon the controver&s;y, except his own work.</P>
<P>I &s;ent him back his order, his Chamberlain's key, and his pen&s;ion; he then did every thing in his power to make me &s;tay, and I every thing in my power to depart. He again gave me his cro&s;s and his key, and would have me to &s;up with him; I therefore once more &s;upped like Democles, after which I parted with a promi&s;e to return, but with a firm de&s;ign ne|ver to &s;ee him more.</P>
<P>Thus there were four of us who had e&s;caped in a &s;hort time, Cha&s;ol, Darget, Algaroti, and I; in fact, there was no &s;uch thing as

&s;taying. It is well known how much mu&s;t be borne from Kings, but Frederic was too free in the abu&s;e of his prerogative. All &s;ociety has its laws, except the &s;ociety of the Lion and the Lamb. Frederic continually failed in the fir&s;t of the&s;e laws; which is, to &s;ay nothing di&s;obliging to any of the company. He often u&s;ed to a&s;k his Chamberlain Polnitz, if he would not willingly change his religion a fourth time, and offered to pay a hundred crowns down for his conver&s;ion. "Good God, my dear Polnitz, he would &s;ay, I have forgot the name of that per&s;on at the Hague, whom you cheated by &s;elling him ba&s;e for pure &s;ilver; let me beg of you to a&s;&s;i&s;t my memory a little." He treated poor d'Argenes in much the &s;ame way; and yet the&s;e two victims remained. Polnitz having wa&s;ted his fortune, was obliged to &s;wallow &s;erpents for bread, and had no other food; and d'Argens had no property in the world, but his Jewi&s;h Letters, and his wife, called Cochois, a bad provincial actre&s;s, and &s;o ugly &s;he could get no employment at any trade, though &s;he practi&s;ed &s;everal. As for Maupertuis, who had been &s;illy enough to place out his money at Berlin, and not think|ing a hundred pi&s;toles better in a free coun|try than a thou&s;and in a de&s;potic one, he had no choice but to wear the &s;etters which him|&s;elf had forged.</P>

<P>LEAVING my palace of Alcina, I went to pa&s;s a month with the Dutche&s;s of Saxe-Go|tha, the be&s;t of Prince&s;&s;es, full of gentlene&s;s, di&s;cretion, and equanimity, and who, God be thanked, did not make ver&s;es. After that I &s;pent a few days at the country-hou&s;e of the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, who was &s;till a remove father from poetry than the Prince&s;s of Gotha. Thus I took breath, and thence continued, by &s;hort journies, my rout to Franckfort, where a very odd kind of de&s;tiny was in re&s;erve for me.</P>
<P>I fell ill at Franckfort, and one of my nieces, the widow of a Captain who had belonged to the regiment of Champagne, a mo&s;t amiable woman, with excellent talents, and who, more|over, was e&s;teemed at Paris as belonging to

the Order of Good Company, had the courage to quit that city, and come to me on the Maine, where &s;he found me a pri&s;oner of war.</P>
<P>This fine adventure happened thus: one Fre&iuml;tag, who had been bani&s;hed Dre&s;den, after having been put in chains and condemn|ed to the wheel-barrow, became afterwards an agent to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who was glad to be &s;erved by &s;uch-like Mini&s;ters, becau&s;e they a&s;ked no wages but what they could &s;teal from travellers.</P>
<P>This Amba&s;&s;ador, and one Schmitt, a trade&s;|man, formerly condemned and puni&s;hed for coining, &s;ignified to me, on the part of his Maje&s;ty the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, that I mu&s;t not depart from Franckfort, till I had given back the precious effects I had carried off from his Maje&s;ty. "My very good Me&s;&s;ieurs (&s;aid I) I have brought nothing out of that country, I can a&s;&s;ure you, not even the lea&s;t regret; what, then, are the&s;e famous jewels of the crown of Brandenbourg, that you thus re-demand?"&mdash; "Dat it be, Mont&s;eer (an&s;wered Fre&iuml;tag) ouf dey vurks ouf poe&s;y ouf de King mine ma&s;ter." &mdash;"Oh!

<P>Fre&iuml;tag then propo&s;ed that I &s;hould &s;tay at
<PB N="378" REF="024210_0377_0FC5692B768663A8">
Franckfort till this trea&s;ure arrived from Leip|&s;ic, and &s;igned the following curious quittance:</P>
<P>Mont&s;eer &s;o &s;oon as &s;hawl dey great pack come ouf Leip&s;ic, mit de vurks ouf poe&s;y be given mit me, you &s;hawl go ouf vere you do plea&s;e. Given at Franckfort de vur&s;t of June, 1753.&mdash;Fre&iuml;tag, Re&s;ident ouf de King mine ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>At the bottom of which I &s;igned,&mdash;Good, vor dey vurks ouf poe&s;y ouf de King your ma|&s;ter:&mdash;With which the Re&s;ident was well &s;a|tisfied.</P>
<P>On the twelfth of June the great pack of poe&s;y came, and I faithfully remitted the &s;a|cred depo&s;it, imagining I might then depart, without offence to any crowned head; but at the very in&s;tant when we were &s;etting off, I, my Secretary, my &s;ervants, and even my niece, were arre&s;ted. Four &s;oldiers dragged us through the mid&s;t of the dirt, before M. Schmitt, who had I know not what right of Privy. Coun&s;ellor to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. This Franck|fort trader thought him&s;elf at that moment a Pru&s;&s;ian General; he commanded twelve of the town guards, with all the importance and grandeur an affair of &s;uch con&s;equence requi|red. My niece had a pa&s;&s;port from the King of France, and, moreover, never had correct|ed the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's ver&s;es. Women are u&s;ually re&s;pected amid&s;t the horrors of war, but the Coun&s;ellor Schmitt, and the Re&s;ident Fre&iuml;tag, endeavoured to pay their court to

Frederic, by hauling one of the fair &s;ex through the mud. They &s;hut us up in a kind of inn, at the door of which the twelve &s;oldiers were po&s;ted. Four others were placed in my cham|ber, four in the garret, where they had con|ducted my niece, and four in a &s;till wore wretched garret, where my Secretary was laid upon &s;traw. My niece, it is true, was allowed a &s;mall bed, but four &s;oldiers, with fixed bay|onets, &s;erved her in&s;tead of curtains and chamber-maids.</P>
<P>In vain we urged we had been invited to the court the Emperor had elected at Franck|fort; that my Secretary was a Florentine, and a &s;ubject of his Imperial Maje&s;ty; that I and my niece were &s;ubject of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King; and that there was no difference be|tween us and the Margrave of Brandenbourg. They informed us, that the Margrave had more power at Franckfort than the Emperor.</P>
<P>Twelve days were we held pri&s;oners of war, for which we paid a hundred and forty crowns, or &s;eventeen pounds ten &s;hillings a day. The Merchant Schmitt had &s;eized on all my effects, which were given back one half lighter: one need not wi&s;h to pay dearer for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oe&s;y of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. I lo&s;t about a much as it had co&s;t him to &s;end for me and to take le&s;&s;ons, and we were quits at parting.</P>
<P>To complete the adventure, one Venduren, a Book&s;eller at the Hague, knave by profe&s;&s;ion, and bankrupt by habit, was then retired to
<PB N="380" REF="024210_0379_0FC5692E87362548">
Franckfort. This was the man to whom I had made a pre&s;ent thirteen years before of Fre|deric's manu&s;cript of the Anti-Machiavel. One finds friends where one lea&s;t expects them. He pretended that his Maje&s;ty owed him &s;ome twenty ducats, for which I was re&s;pon&s;ible: he reckoned the intere&s;t, and the intere&s;t of the intere&s;t. The Sieur Friliard, a Burgo-ma&s;ter of Franckfort, in the then year of his reign, &s;aid, he, as a Burgo-ma&s;ter, found the account exceedingly right; he likewi&s;e found the means to make me di&s;bur&s;e thirty ducats, &s;ix and twenty of which he took to him&s;elf, and gave the remaining four to the hone&s;t Book|&s;eller.</P>
<P>The&s;e O&s;trogothian and Vandalian affairs being all thus &s;atisfactorily ended, I embraced my ho&s;ts, thanked them for their kind recep|tion, and departed.</P>
<P>Some time after I want to drink the waters of Plombieres, and with them drank heartily of the waters of Lethe, from a thorough per|&s;ua&s;ion, that misfortunes of all kinds are good for nothing but to be forgotten. My niece, Madame Dennis, who was the con&s;olation of my life, attached to me by her ta&s;te for let|ters, and the tendere&s;t friend&s;hip, accompa|nied me from Plombieres to Lyons. Here I was received by the acclamations of the whole city, and tolerably ill too by the Cardinal de Tencin, Archbi&s;hop of Lyons, &s;o well known by the manner in which he had made his for|tune;
<PB N="381" REF="024210_0380_0FC5692FBB5C80B0">
that is, in making the famous Law, or La&s;s, Author of the &s;y&s;tem that ruined France, a Catholic. His Council of Embrin fini&s;hed the fortune his conver&s;ion of Law had begun. This &s;y&s;tem made him rich enough to purcha&s;e a Cardinal's hat. He was a Mini&s;ter of State, and told me in confidence, he dur&s;t not give me a public dinner becau&s;e the King of France was vexed that I had quitted him for the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. To this I an&s;wered I never dined, and as to Kings or Cardinals, I was the man who perhaps of any in the world was &s;oone&s;t determined how to act.</P>
<P>I had been advi&s;ed to drink the waters of Aix, in Savoy, and though this place was un|der the dominion of a King, I proceeded to take the journey. I nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;&s;ed through Geneva, where the famous Phy&s;ician Tronchin was ju&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, and who declared that the waters of Aix would kill, but that he would cure me, and I followed his advice. No Ca|tholic is permitted to &s;ettle at Geneva, nor yet in the Swi&s;s Prote&s;tant Cantons; and it was to me a &s;ubject of plea&s;antry, to aconite domains in the only country upon earth where it was forbidden I &s;hould have any.</P>
<P>I bought, by a very &s;ingular kind of con|tract, of which there was no example in that country, a &s;mall e&s;tate of about &s;ixty acres, which they &s;old me for about twice as much as it would have co&s;t me at Paris; but plea&s;ure is never too dear. The hou&s;e was pretty and
<PB N="382" REF="024210_0381_0FC5693140FAFDE8">
commodious, and the pro&s;pect charming; it a&s;toni&s;hes without tiring: on one &s;ide is the Lake of Geneva, and the city on the other. The Rhone runs from the former in va&s;t gu&s;h|es, forming a canal at the bottom of my gar|den, whence is &s;een the Arve de&s;cending from the Savoy Mountains, and precipitating it&s;elf into the Rhone, and farther &s;till another river. A hundred country-&s;eats, a hundred delightful gardens, ornament the borders of the lakes and rivers. The Alps at a va&s;t di&s;tance ri&s;e and terminate the horizon, and among their prodigious precipices, twenty leagues extent of mountain are beheld covered with eternal &s;nows.</P>
<P>I had another good hou&s;e, with a more ex|ten&s;ive view, at Lau&s;anne; but a &s;eat near Geneva is much more agreeable. In the&s;e two habitations I enjoyed what Kings do not give, or rather what they take away, Liberty and Ea&s;e. I likewi&s;e had what they &s;ometimes do give, and what I had not of them. Here then I put my own precepts in practice.</P>
<P>How happy did I live in this iron age! Every convenience of life and good cheer were found in my two hou&s;es. An affable and intelligent &s;ociety, filled up the moments which &s;tudy and the care of my health left va|cant. My pro&s;perity was &s;ufficient to make my dear fellow-labourers in literature bur&s;t with envy. I was not however born rich, and it may be a&s;ked by what art I could acquire
<PB N="383" REF="024210_0382_0FC56932B780B1C8">
wealth enough to live like a Farmer-general: to which I an&s;wer, and I would have others make me their example, I had &s;een &s;o many men of letters poor and de&s;pi&s;ed, that I had long determined not to augment the number.</P>
<P>In France, every man mu&s;t be either the hammer or the anvil, and I was born the lat|ter. A &s;mall patrimony daily becomes le&s;s, becau&s;e the price of every thing gradually in|crea&s;es, and becau&s;e government often has both rent and crop.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to be attentive to every al|teration which Mini&s;try, ever in want and ever incon&s;tant, makes in the finances. There always are occa&s;ional opportunities by which an individual may profit without obligation to any one, and nothing is &s;o agreeable as to be one &s;elf the founder of one's fortune. The fir&s;t efforts are a little painful, the following are plea&s;ant; and he who is an economi&s;t in his youth, will be &s;urpri&s;ed in old age at his own wealth, which is the time when fortune is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary. It was then I enjoyed fortune: it was then that, after having lived with Kings, I became a King my&s;elf.</P>
<P>And now, while living in this peaceable op|ulence, and the mo&s;t rigid independence, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia thought proper to be appea&s;ed: in 1755 he &s;ent me an Opera he had made from my Tragedy of Merope, which was, with|out di&s;pute, the wor&s;t thing he ever wrote. From that time he continued to write to me:
<PB N="384" REF="024210_0383_0FC56936D04F9D08">
I always had held a corre&s;pondence with his &s;i&s;ter, the Margrave&s;s of Bareith, who&s;e good|will towards me was unalterable.</P>
<P>Thus while I, in my retreat, enjoyed the mo&s;t plea&s;ant life imaginable, I had the philo|&s;ophic &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing, that the Kings of Europe ta&s;ted not of my tranquillity; and of thence inferring, that the &s;ituation of an in|dividual is often preferable to that of the greate&s;t Kings, as will pre&s;ently be &s;een.</P>
<P>In 1756, England made a piratical war up|on France for &s;ome acres of &s;now; at the &s;ame time that the Empre&s;s Queen of Hungary appeared very de&s;irous to recover her dear Seli&s;ia, of which &s;he had been pillaged by his Maje&s;ty of Pru&s;&s;ia. For this purpo&s;e &s;he ne|gociated with the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia and the King of Poland, that is, in quality of Elector of Saxony, for nobody negociates with the Poles. On the other hand, the King of France wi&s;hed to revenge him&s;elf upon Hanover, for the mi&s;chief which the Elector of Hanover, the King of England, did him at &s;ea. Frederic, who at that time was in alliance with France, and who held our government in the mo&s;t pro|found contempt, preferred an alliance with England; he therefore united him&s;elf with the hou&s;e of Hanover, imagining he could keep the Ru&s;&s;ians out of Pru&s;&s;ia with one hand, and the French out of Germany with the other. He was mi&s;taken in both the&s;e imaginings; but their was a third in which he was not mi&s;|taken; which was to invade Saxony under
<PB N="385" REF="024210_0384_0FC569386BA1EC00">
pretext of friend&s;hip, and make war upon the Empre&s;s Queen of Hungary with the money he &s;hould rob the Saxons of. The Marquis of Brandenbourg, by this remarkable manoeuvre, &s;ingly changed the whole &s;y&s;tem of Europe. The King of France, de&s;irous of retaining him in his alliance, &s;ent the Duke de Nivernois, a man of wit, and who made very pretty ver&s;es, into Pru&s;&s;ia. The emba&s;&s;age of a Duke, a Peer, and a Poet, &s;eemed likely to flatter the vanity and ta&s;te of Frederic; but he laughed at the King of France, and &s;igned his treaty with England, the very day the Emba&s;&s;ador arrived. He played off the Duke and the Peer very happily, and made an epigram upon the Poet.</P>
<P>It happened at that time to be the privilege of poetry to govern kingdoms. There was another Poet at Paris al&s;o, a man of rank, very poor, but very amiable; in a word, the Abb&eacute; de Bernis, &s;ince Cardinal. He began by writing ver&s;es again&s;t me; he afterwards was my friend, though that was of little &s;er|vice to him; but he likewi&s;e became the friend of Madame de Pompadour, and &s;he &s;erved him effectually. He had been &s;ent from Parna&s;&s;us on an emba&s;&s;y to Venice; and he was then re|turned to Paris, and in great credit.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had glided a ver&s;e in his poor book of poe&s;y, which that Fre&iuml;tag had re-demanded &s;o earne&s;tly at Franckfort, again&s;t the Abb&eacute; de Bernis.</P>
<Q><PB N="386" REF="024210_0385_0FC5693AF4FD71E8">"Avoid the &s;teril abundance of Bernis."</Q>
<P>I do not believe either the book or the ver&s;e ever reached the Abb&eacute;; but as God is ju&s;t, God made him an in&s;trument to avenge France of Frederic. The Abb&eacute; concluded an offen|&s;ive and defen&s;ive treaty with M. de Starem|berg, the Au&s;trian Amba&s;&s;ador, in de&s;pight of Rouill&eacute;, then Mini&s;ter for Foreign affairs. Madame de Pompadour pre&s;ided at the nego|ciation; and Rouill&eacute; was obliged to &s;ign the treaty, in conjunction with the Abb&eacute; de Ber|nis, which was a precedent without example. Rouill&eacute;, it mu&s;t be owned, was the mo&s;t u&s;e|le&s;s Secretary of State the King ever had; and moreover, the mo&s;t ignorant the Long Robe ever knew. He a&s;ked one day if Wete|ravia was in Italy.

<P>Mademoi&s;elle Poi&s;&s;on, the wife of Le Nor|mand, and Marchione&s;s de Pompadour, was in reality fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of State. Certain out|rageous terms let &s;lip again&s;t her by Frederic, who neither &s;pared women nor poets, had wounded the Marchione&s;s to the heart, and contributed not a little to that revolution in affairs, which, in a moment, re-united the French and Au&s;trians, after more than two hundred years of a hatred &s;uppo&s;ed to be im|mortal.

The court of France, that pretended to cru&s;h Au&s;tria, in 1741, &s;upported her in 1756; and in conclu&s;ion, France, Sweden, Ru&s;&s;ia, Hungary, the half of Germany, and the Fi&s;cal of the Empire, all declared again&s;t the &s;ingle Marquis of Brandenbourg. This Prince, who&s;e grandfather could &s;carcely main|tain twenty thou&s;and men, had an army of a hundred thou&s;and foot, and forty thou&s;and hor&s;e, well provided, well &s;elected, and better di&s;ciplined; but there were four hundred thou|&s;and men in arms to oppo&s;e the&s;e. It hap|pened in that war, that each party &s;eized upon what was next at hand. Frederic took Sax|ony; France took the territories of Frederic, from the town of Guilders to Minden upon the We&s;er, and for a while po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the Elec|torate of Hanover and He&s;&s;e, the allies of Fre|deric; while the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia took the whole of Pru&s;&s;ia. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, beat|en at fir&s;t by the Ru&s;&s;ians, beat the Au&s;trians, and was afterwards beaten by them in Bohe|mia, the eighteenth of June, 1757.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of one battle ought apparently to have cru&s;hed this Monarch; pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides by the Ru&s;&s;ians, French and Au&s;trians, he him&s;elf gave all for lo&s;t. Mar&s;hal de Ri|chelieu had ju&s;t concluded a treaty near Stadt, with the Hanoverians and He&s;&s;ians, which greatly re&s;embled that of the Caudian Forks. Their army was no longer allowed to &s;erve, and the Mar&s;hal was ready to enter Saxony

with &s;ixty thou&s;and men: the Prince de Sou|bi&s;e prepared to penetrate it on another &s;ide, with thirty thou&s;and, and was to be &s;econded by the arms of the circles of the empire, whence they were to march to Berlin. The Au&s;trians had gained a &s;econd victory, and were already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bre&s;lau; and one of their Ge|nerals had even pu&s;hed to Berlin, and laid it under contribution. The trea&s;ury of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was nearly exhau&s;ted, and in all ap|pearance he would not long have a &s;ingle vil|lage left. They were going to put him under the ban of the empire; his proce&s;s was begun; he was declared a rebel, and had he been tak|en, in all probability would have been con|demned to lo&s;e his head.</P>
<P>In this extremity he took a fancy to kill him&s;elf. He wrote to his &s;i&s;ter, the Margra|ve&s;s of Bareith, that he was going to terminate his life; but he could not conclude the play without rhyming. His pa&s;&s;ion for poetry was &s;till &s;tronger than his hatred of life; he there|fore wrote the Marquis d' Argens a long epi&s;tle in ver&s;e, wherein he informed him of his re&s;o|lution, and bade him adieu.</P>

<P>As he marched towards the French and Im|periali&s;ts, he wrote to the Margrave&s;s his &s;i&s;|ter, that he &s;hould kill him&s;elf, but he was hap|pier than he &s;aid or hoped. He waited on the fifth of November, 1757, for the French and Imperial army, in a tolerably advantageous po&s;t at Ro&s;bach, on the frontiers of Saxony; and as he had been continually talking of killing him|&s;elf, he was willing his brother, Prince Henry,
<PB N="392" REF="024210_0391_0FC569492D067958">
&s;hould perform this promi&s;e for him, at the head of five Pru&s;&s;ian battalions, which were to &s;u&s;tain the fir&s;t &s;hock of the enemy, while his artillery thundered upon them, and his ca|valry attacked theirs.</P>
<P>Prince Henry was, in fact, &s;lightly wound|ed in the neck by a mu&s;ket ball, and I believe was the only Pru&s;&s;ian hurt on that day. The French and Au&s;trians fled at the fir&s;t di&s;charge, and the rout was the mo&s;t unheard of and com|plete that hi&s;tory can afford. The battle of Ro&s;bach &s;hall long be celebrated. Thirty thou&s;and French, and twenty thou&s;and Impe|riali&s;ts, were &s;een flying, &s;hamefully and pre|cipitately, before five battalions and &s;ome &s;quadrons. The defeats of Agincourt, Cre&s;&s;y, and Poictiers, were not more humiliating. The di&s;cipline and military evolutions, which the father had begun, and the &s;on made perfect, were the true cau&s;e of this &s;trange victory. The Pru&s;&s;ian exerci&s;e had been fifty years in bringing to perfection.

in di&s;order at the very &s;ight of the Pru&s;&s;ians; and Fortune, in one quarter of an hour, &s;natch|ed Frederic from the depth of de&s;pair to &s;eat him on the heights of happine&s;s and glory.</P>

<P>The fatal affair at Ro&s;bach, occa&s;ioned all France to murmur at the treaty of the Abb&eacute; de Bernis, with the court of Vienna. The Car|dinal de Tencin, Archbi&s;hop of Lyons, had al|ways maintained his rank of Mini&s;ter of State, and a private corre&s;pondence with the King of France and he was, more than any one, a ver&s;e to the Au&s;trian alliance. He had given me a reception at Lyons, which he had a right to believe was not very &s;atisfactory; the itch of intriguing, however, which followed him in his retreat, and which, it is &s;aid, never leaves men in place, made him de&s;irous of leaguing with me to engage the Margrave&s;s of Bareith to treat with him, and put the intere&s;ts of her brother in his hands. He would reconcile the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to the King of France, and hoped to procure a peace. It was not diffi|cult to per&s;uade Madame de Barieth, and the King her brother, to this negociation; and I undertook it with the greater alacrity, becau&s;e I fore&s;aw it could not &s;ucceed. The Margra|ve&s;s
<PB N="394" REF="024210_0393_0FC5694E928C0C00">
wrote to Frederic, and the letters between her and the Cardinal pa&s;&s;ed through my hands. I had the &s;ecret &s;atisfaction of being the in|termediator in that grand affair; and perhaps a &s;till farther plea&s;ure, that of fore&s;eeing the Cardinal was preparing for him&s;elf a &s;ubject of great di&s;appointment. He wrote to the King of France, and inclo&s;ed the letter of the Margrave&s;s; but how utter was his a&s;toni&s;h|ment at receiving a laconic an&s;wer from the King by which he learnt, the Secretary for Fo|reign Affairs would inform him what was his Ma|je&s;ty's plea&s;ure. The Abb&eacute; de Bernis dictated the an&s;wer which the Cardinal was obliged to &s;end to Frederic; which an&s;wer was an entire refu&s;al to negociate. He was forced to &s;ign a copy of this letter, by which every thing was ended, and died of chagrin in about a fortnight afterwards.</P>
<P>I never could thoroughly under&s;tand this kind of death, or how Mini&s;ters of State, and old Cardinals with hardended &s;ouls, &s;hould have a &s;ufficient degree of &s;en&s;ibility to die through &s;ome trifling di&s;gu&s;t. My de&s;ign was only to laugh at him; to mortify, and not to kill.</P>
<P>There was a kind of greatne&s;s in the Mini|&s;try refu&s;ing thus to treat of peace with the King of Pru&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a, after having been beaten by him, and humbled; there was al&s;o great fide|lity and good na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ure in &s;acrificing them&s;elves for the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; but the&s;e virtues

were long ill recompen&s;ed by Fortune. The Hanoverians, He&s;&s;ians, and Brun&s;wickians, were le&s;s ob&s;ervant of public faith, but more &s;uc|ce&s;sful. They had &s;tipulated with the Mar|&s;hal de Richelieu not to bear arms again&s;t us, but to repa&s;s the Elbe, beyond which they had been &s;ent; they, however, broke their bargain of the Caudian Forks, as &s;oon as they knew we had been beaten at Ro&s;bach. De&s;ertion, the want of di&s;cipline, and di&s;ea&s;e, de&s;troyed our armies; and the re&s;ult of all our opera|tions, in the &s;pring of 1758, was, that we had lo&s;t twelve millions and a half &s;terling, and fif|ty thou&s;and men in Germany, in &s;upport of Maria-Tere&s;a, as we had done in 1741 with fighting again&s;t her.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who had beaten our army at Ro&s;bach, in Thuringia, went next to fight the Au&s;trian army at &s;ixty leagues di&s;|tance. The French then might &s;till have en|tered Saxony; the victors were gone, there was nothing to oppo&s;e them; but they had thrown away their arms, lo&s;t their cannon, ammunition, provi&s;ions, and e&s;pecially their under&s;tanding. They were di&s;per&s;ed, and their remains were with difficulty collected. A month afterwards, and on the &s;ame day, Fre|deric gained a &s;till more &s;ignal and better fought victory over the Au&s;trians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear Bre&s;lau.

I behold from my windows the city where John Chauvin, the Picard, called Cal|vin, reigned; and the place where he burnt Servet for the good of his &s;oul. Almo&s;t all the prie&s;ts of this country think at pre&s;ent like Servet; nay they even go farther. They do not believe that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was God; and the&s;e Me&s;&s;ieurs, who formerly gave no quar|ter to purgatory, are now &s;o far humani&s;ed, as to find favour for &s;ouls in hell. They pretend their torments &s;hall not be eternal; that The|&s;eus &s;hall not always &s;it upon his &s;tony chair, nor Sy&s;iphus continue everla&s;tingly to roll his rock. Thus they have turned their hell, in
<PB N="397" REF="024210_0396_0FC569582F59C3E0">
which they no longer believe, into purgatory, in which al&s;o they do not believe. This is ra|ther a plea&s;ant revolution in the hi&s;tory of the human mind, and might furni&s;h di&s;putes enough for the cutting of throats, making of bonfires, and acting St. Bartholomew's day once more. And yet they do not even call names, and re|proach one another, &s;o much are manners changed.

<P>They would prove to me in form, that Cal|vin was a good Chri&s;tian, and petitioned the Council of Geneva to communicate the papers u&s;ed on the trial of Servet; but the Council was more prudent; the papers were refu&s;ed, and they forbidden to write again&s;t me in Ge|neva.

<P>Philo&s;ophy enjoyed a &s;till more &s;ignal victo|ry over its enemies at Lau&s;anne. Some Go&s;|pel Mini&s;ters of that country thought proper to compile, I know not what bad book again&s;t me, for the honour, as they called it, of chri|&s;tianity; and I, with little difficulty, was em|powered

to &s;eize and &s;uppre&s;s the impre&s;&s;ion by authority of the Magi&s;trates. This was perhaps the fir&s;t time Theologians have been obliged to be &s;ilent, and re&s;pect a Philosopher.

But as they had neither a Monarch of the market|place, like the Duke de Beaufort, nor a Co-adjutor,

granting benedictions with a dagger, they proceeded only to wordy wars. They began by forging bank bills for the other world, invented as I have already &s;aid by Beau|mont, Archbi&s;hop of Paris, an ob&s;tinate man, who did evil with all his heart, and from an exce&s;s of zeal. He was a &s;erious fool, &s;ome|thing in the &s;tyle of St. Thomas &agrave; Becket. The quarrel grew more violent concerning an of|fice in the ho&s;pital, the appointment to which the Parliament pretended was in them; and the Archbi&s;hop holding it to be a &s;acred place, &s;aid it depended totally on the church. Paris was all divided into parties, and the trifling factions of Jan&s;eni&s;ts and Molini&s;ts did not &s;pare each other. The King thought pro|per to treat them as they &s;ome times &s;erve fools who fight in the &s;treet, over whom they throw buckets of water to part them: he very rightly &s;aid they were both wrong; but they remained not the le&s;s enveno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d.

They proceeded to &s;uch lengths at la&s;t, that the King re&s;olved to aboli&s;h one of their Chambers, and dimini&s;h the others; and, &s;oon after, the&s;e Me&s;&s;ieurs all had their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, except tho&s;e of the great Chamber. Loud murmurs now went abroad; they publicly declaimed again&s;t the King, and the fire which came out of their mouth unhappily caught the brain of a Lackey, named Damiens, who often frequented the great Hall. It is proved, by the proce&s;s, this fanatic of the long robe never intended to kill the King, but only to inflict a gentle correcti|on. There is nothing &s;o ab&s;urd which may not enter the head of man. This poor wretch had been u&s;her to the Je&s;uit's College, where I have &s;ometimes &s;een the &s;cholars give &s;light &s;tabs with their penknives, and the u&s;hers re|turn them. Damiens, therefore, went to Ver|&s;aills with this re&s;olution, and there, in the mid&s;t of his cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iers and guards, wounded the King with a &s;mall penknife.</P>
<P>They did not fail during the fir&s;t horror of the accident, to impute the blow to the arm of the Je&s;uits, to whom, &s;aid they, it belonged according to ancient u&s;age. I have red a let|ter from one father Griffet, in which he &s;ays, This time it was not us; it is at pre&s;ent the

turn of Me&s;&s;ieurs. It was of cour&s;e the office of the Grand Prevot of the Court to judge the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, becau&s;e the crime had been committed within the precincts of the palace. The cul|prit began by accu&s;ing &s;even members of the Court des Enqu&egrave;tes, and they wi&s;hed nothing better than to leave this accu&s;ation upon re|cord, and execute the criminal. Thus the King rendered the Parliament odious, and ob|tained an advantage which will endure as long as the monarchy.</P>

<P>IT was thought, that M. d'Argen&s;on advi&s;ed the King to grant the Parliament permi&s;&s;ion to judge the foregoing affair, and he was well rewarded; for eight days after he lo&s;t his place, and was exiled. The king had the weakne&s;s to grant large pen&s;ions to the Coun&s;ellors who conducted the trial of Damiens, as if they had rendered him &s;ome &s;ignal and difficult &s;ervice; which conduct in&s;pired them with new con|fidence. They again imagined them&s;elves im|portant per&s;onages, and their chimeras of re|pre&s;enting the nation, and being tutors to Kings, were once more awakened.</P>
<P>This &s;cene over, and having nothing el&s;e to do, they amu&s;ed them&s;elves with per&s;ecuting the philo&s;ophers. Omer Joli de Fleury, Ad|vocate general of the Parliament of Paris, di&s;|played a triumph the mo&s;t complete, that ig|norance, deceit, and hypocri&s;y ever obtained.
<PB N="403" REF="024210_0402_0FC5677C5BD4F060">
Several men of letters, mo&s;t e&s;timable from their learning and deportment, formed an a&s;|&s;ociation to compo&s;e an immen&s;e dictionary of whatever could enlighten the human mind, and it became on object of commerce with the book&s;ellers. The Chancellor, the Mini&s;try, all encouraged an enterpri&s;e &s;o noble; &s;even volumes had already appeared, and were tran&s;|lated into Engli&s;h, Italian, German, and Dutch. This trea&s;ure, opened by the French to all na|tions, might be con&s;idered as what did us at that time the mo&s;t honour; &s;o much were the excellent articles in the Encyclopedia &s;uperior to the bad, which were al&s;o tolerably nume|rous. They had little to complain of in the work, except too many puerile declamations unfortunately adopted by the authors of the collection, who &s;eized whatever came to hand to &s;well the book; but all which tho&s;e authors wrote them&s;elves was good.</P>
<P>Omer Joli de Fleury, however, on the twen|ty-third of February, 1759, accu&s;ed the&s;e poor philo&s;ophers of being Athei&s;ts, Dei&s;ts, corrupt|ers of youth, rebels to the King, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and to prove his accu&s;ation, cited St. Paul, and the trials of Theophilus and Abraham Chau|maix<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abraham Chaumaix, formerly * * *, &s;ince Jan|&s;eni&s;t and Convul&s;ionary, was then the oracle of the Parliament of Paris. Omer Joli de Fleury cited him as a Father of the Church; he has &s;ince been a &s;chool|ma&s;ter at Mo&s;cow.</NOTE>. He wanted nothing but to have read
<PB N="404" REF="024210_0403_0FC567804ED4A180">
the book again&s;t which he exclaimed; for if he had read it, he was a &s;trange imbecile being. He demanded ju&s;tice of the Court again&s;t the article &s;oul, which, according to him, was pure materiali&s;m.</P>
<P>Pray remark that the article &s;oul, one of the wor&s;t in the work, was written by a poor Doctor of the Sorbonne, who killed him&s;elf with declaiming, right or wrong, again&s;t ma|teriali&s;m.</P>
<P>The whole di&s;cour&s;e of this Omer Joli de Fleury was a &s;tring of &s;imilar blunders. He informed again&s;t a book he had either not read or not under&s;tood; and the entire Parliament, at the requisition of Omer, condemned the work, not only without examining, but even without reading a &s;ingle page. This manner of doing ju&s;tice, is very much beneath the cu&s;|tom of Bridoye, for there they may chance to be right.</P>
<P>The editors had procured the King's privi|lege, and the Parliament certainly had no right to revoke a privilege granted by his Maje&s;ty. It appertains not to them either to judge of an Arr&ecirc;t du Con&s;eil, or of any thing confirmed in Chancery: they however a&s;&s;umed the power to condemn what the Chancellor had approv|ed, and appointed Lawyers to decide upon the &s;ubjects of geometry and metaphy&s;ics contain|ed in the Encyclopedia. A Chancellor of the lea&s;t fortitude would have annulled the Arret of Parliament as incompetent: the Chan|cellor
<PB N="405" REF="024210_0404_0FC567814F20C5B0">
L'Amoignon &s;atisfied him&s;elf with re|voking the privilege, that he might not under|go the &s;hame of &s;eeing what he had &s;tamped with the &s;eal of &s;upreme authority judged and condemned.</P>
<P>One would imagine this adventure had hap|pened in the days of Father Gara&s;&s;e, and that the&s;e were arrets again&s;t taking emetics; but on the contrary, it was in the mo&s;t enlighten|ed age France had ever &s;een. So true it is, that one fool is enough to di&s;honour a nation.</P>
<P>No one will &s;cruple to confe&s;s, that under &s;uch circum&s;tances, Paris was no re&s;ting-place for a Philo&s;opher, and that Ari&s;totle was very prudent in retiring to Chalcis when Fanata|ci&s;m reigned at Athens. Be&s;ides, the condition of a man of letters, at Paris, is but one &s;tep above a Mountebank.</P>
<P>The place of Gentleman in ordinary to his Maje&s;ty, which the King had given me, was no great thing. Men are very &s;illy; for my part, I think it much better to build a fine man&s;ion, as I did, have a theatre, and keep a good table, than to be hunted at Paris like Helvetius, by people holding the court of Par|liament, or by other people holding the &s;tables of the Sorbonne. As I was certain I could never make men more rea&s;onable, the Parli|ament le&s;s pedantic, nor the Theologians le&s;s ridiculous, I continued to be happy far from their follies.</P>
<P>And yet, while I contemplate the &s;torm, I am
<PB N="406" REF="024210_0405_0FC567830BFFF9C8">
almo&s;t a&s;hamed of my own tranquillity. I behold Germany dyed in blood; France utter|ly ruined; our fleets and armies beaten; our mini&s;ters di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, one after another, without any pro&s;pect of better &s;ucce&s;s; and the King of Portugal a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, not by a Lacky, but the Nobility of the kingdom. Neither can the Je&s;uits this time &s;ay, it was not us: they have carefully pre&s;erved their rights; it has been &s;ufficiently proved the&s;e good Fathers had giv|en the &s;anctified knife to the Parricides. They give for rea&s;on their &s;overeignty of Paraguay, and &s;ay they have treated with the King of Portugal as between crown and crown.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now relate a trifling, but as &s;ingular an adventure as ever happened &s;ince Kings and Poets fir&s;t were &s;een on earth. Frederic, hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time guarding the frontiers of Sile&s;ia, in an impenetrable camp, began to be tired of inactivity; and, therefore, to pa&s;s time away, compo&s;ed an Ode, and &s;igned it Frederic; this he put at the head of an enor|mous bundle of ver&s;e and pro&s;e, which he &s;ent to me. I opened the package, and found I had not been the fir&s;t who had performed that operation; it was evident the &s;eals had been broken, and I was terrified at reading the fol|lowing ver&s;es:
<Q><L>Oh trifling nation, light and vain!</L>
<L>Are the&s;e the warriors whom Turenne</L>
<L>And Luxembourg with laurels bound,</L>
<L>Whom Fame's immortal honours crown'd;</L>

<P>I trembled as I read the poem, &s;ome lines of which are excellent, or may pa&s;s for &s;uch. I had unfortunately acquired, and de&s;erved, the reputation of having been the continual corrector of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's poetry. The packet had been opened, the ver&s;es read, might perhaps have been publi&s;hed, the King of France would attribute them to me, and I &s;hould become not only guilty of high trea|&s;on again&s;t the King, but, which was &s;till wor&s;e, again&s;t Madame de Pompadour.</P>
<P>In this perplexity, I de&s;ired the French Re|&s;ident at Geneva to come to my hou&s;e, and &s;hewed him the packet. He agreed it had been opened before it arrived, and thought there was no other way of acting in a ca&s;e where the &s;afety of my head was concerned, but &s;ending it as it was to the Duke de Choi|&s;eul, Mini&s;ter of State. In any &s;ituation but this I &s;hould not have followed his advice; but it was nece&s;&s;ary to prevent my own ruin, and I
<PB N="408" REF="024210_0407_0FC567896FC6DD90">
acquainted the court with the true character of its enemy. I knew the Duke de Choi&s;eul would not betray me, but content him&s;elf with per&s;uading his Maje&s;ty that Frederic was an enemy, whom, if they could, they ought to cru&s;h.</P>
<P>The Duke did not &s;top here; he was a man of wit, wrote ver&s;es, and had friends who wrote al&s;o: he paid the King of Pru&s;&s;ia in his own coin, and &s;ent me a &s;atire again&s;t Frederic, as biting and unmerciful as his own. The following lines are extracted from this Poem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have been a&s;&s;ured by M. the P. F. of S. this Ode was written by S. Palinot de Montenoy.</NOTE>:
<Q><L>No longer he the man, by whom</L>

<P>The Duke de Choi&s;eul a&s;&s;ured me when he &s;ent this an&s;wer, that he would print the &s;atire if the King of Pru&s;&s;ia publi&s;hed his; and added, they would beat him as heartily with the pen, as they hoped to do with the &s;word. Had I been inclined &s;o to amu&s;e my&s;elf, it depended only on me to &s;et the King of France and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to war in rhyme, which would have been a farce of novelty upon earth. But I en|joyed another plea&s;ure; that of being more prudent than Frederic. I wrote him word his ode was beautiful, but that he ought not to publi&s;h it; he had glory enough without that, and &s;hould not &s;hut every door of reconcilia|tion with the King of France, aggravate him beyond bearing, and force him to &s;ome de&s;|perate effort to obtain a ju&s;t revenge. I ad|ded, my niece had burnt his ode, in mortal fear of its being imputed to me. He believed me, and returned me thanks; but not without a few reproaches, for having burnt the be&s;t ver&s;es he had ever written. The Duke de Choi&s;eul kept his word, and was di&s;creet.</P>
<P>To make the plea&s;antry complete, I thought it po&s;&s;ible to lay the foundation of the peace of Europe on the&s;e poetical pieces, which might have continued the war to the de&s;truc|tion of Frederic, My corre&s;pondence with
<PB N="410" REF="024210_0409_0FC56794EAB48A78">
the Duke de Choi&s;eul gave birth to that idea; and it appeared &s;o ridiculous, &s;o worthy the tran&s;actions of the times, that I indulged it, and had my&s;elf the &s;atisfaction of proving on what weak and invi&s;ible pivots the de&s;tinies of nations turn. The Duke wrote me &s;everal o&s;ten&s;ible letter, conceived in &s;uch terms, as the King of Pru&s;&s;ia might venture to make overtures of peace without danger of Au&s;tria taking umbrage at France; and Frederic re|turned an&s;wers in a &s;imilar way, with little ri&s;k of di&s;plea&s;ing the Engli&s;h court. This tickli&s;h treaty is &s;till in agitation, and re&s;em|bles the &s;ports of cats, which give a pat with one paw and a &s;cratch with the other. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, driven out of Dre&s;den, and beaten by the Ru&s;&s;ians, is in want of peace; and France, beaten at &s;ea by the Engli&s;h, and on &s;hore by the Hanoverians, with an ill-timed lo&s;s of men and money, is obliged to fini&s;h this ruinous war.</P>
