<HEAD><HI>To</HI> Robert Jordan, <HI>and others the Friends of the Yearly Meeting for Bu&s;ine&s;s, now conven'd in</HI> Philadelphia.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with no &s;mall Unea&s;ine&s;s that I find my&s;elf concerned to apply thus to this Meeting: But as I have been longer and more deeply engaged in Affairs of Go|vernment, and I believe I may &s;afely &s;ay, have con&s;idered the Nature of it more clo&s;ely than any Man be&s;ides in this Province; as I have al&s;o from my Infancy been educated in the Way that I have ever &s;ince walked in, and I hope without Blemi&s;h to the Profe&s;&s;ion; I conceive and hope you will think I have a Right to lay before you, the heavy Pre&s;&s;ure of Mind that &s;ome late Tran&s;actions in this &s;mall Government of ours have given me, through an Apprehen&s;ion, that not only the Reputation of Friends, as a People, but our Liberties and Privileges in general may be deeply affected by them.</P>
<P>But on this Head I think fit to mention, in the fir&s;t Place, That when, above <HI>Forty-two</HI> Years &s;ince, our late Proprietor propo&s;ed to me at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> to come over with him as his Secretary; after I had, agreeably to his Advice, taken Time to con&s;ider of it, which I did very clo&s;ely before I engaged, I had no Scruple to accept of that, or of any other Po&s;t I have &s;ince held: Being &s;en&s;ible, that as Government is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary among&s;t Mankind, &s;o, tho' all Government, as I had clearly &s;een long be|fore, is founded on Force, there mu&s;t be &s;ome proper Per&s;ons to admini&s;ter it; I was therefore the more &s;urpri&s;ed, when I found my Ma&s;ter, on a particular Occa&s;ion in our Voyage hither, tho' coming over to exerci&s;e the Powers of it here in his own Per&s;on, &s;hew'd his Sentiments were otherwi&s;e. But as I have ever endeavoured to think and act con&s;i&s;tently my&s;elf, ob&s;erving Friends had laid it down as their Prin|ciple, That Bearing of Arms, even for Self-Defence, is unlawful; being of a diffe|rent Opinion in this Re&s;pect, tho' I ever condemned offen&s;ive War, I therefore, in a great Mea&s;ure, declined that due Attendance on their Meetings of Bu&s;ine&s;s, which I might otherwi&s;e have given. I mu&s;t here neverthele&s;s add further, that I propo&s;e not, in offering this, to advance Arguments in Support of the Lawfulne&s;s of Self-Defence; which, among&s;t tho&s;e, who, for Con&s;cience Sake, continue in a Condition to put &s;trictly in Practice the Precepts of our Saviour, would be altogether needle&s;s; but where-ever there is private Property, and Mea&s;ures taken to increa&s;e it, by ama&s;&s;ing Wealth, according to our Practice, to a Degree that may tempt others to invade it, it has always appeared to me, to be full as ju&s;tifiable to u&s;e Means to defend it when got, as to acquire it. Notwith&s;tanding which, I am &s;en&s;ible our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> have &s;o openly and repeatedly profe&s;&s;ed their Principles on that Head to the Government, and they have thereupon been &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed by its Favours, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> peaceable People, from whom no Plots or Machinations of any Kind are to be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> that I &s;hall con&s;ider this, as I have &s;aid, to be their &s;tanding and avowed Principle, and only offer to your Con&s;ideration, what I conceive to be a clear De|mon&s;tration, that all Civil Government, as well as Military, is founded on Force; and therefore, that Friends, as &s;uch, in the Strictne&s;s of their Principles, ought in no manner to engage in it: As al&s;o that as we are a &s;ubordinate Government, and therefore accountable to a &s;uperiour One for our Conduct, it is expected by that Supe|riour,
<PB N="2" REF="004740_0002_100DD181521CB030">that this Province, as well as all the other <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies, &s;hall make the be&s;t Defence, again&s;t a foreign Enemy, in its Power, as it was &s;trictly required to do by the late Queen, in the la&s;t <HI>French</HI> War, upon which the then Governor rai&s;ed a Militia of three Companies of Voluntiers, but for Want of a Law for its Support, it dropt in about two Years after; and the like Orders may undoubtedly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> again, when another War with <HI>France</HI> breaks out, which is &s;aid now to unavoidable: That it is of the greater Importance to <HI>Britain,</HI> as it is, for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ons, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly to our&s;elves, that the Country &s;hould be defended, as it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> the Heart of the other <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies on the Main: And that it is well <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Europe,</HI> that from the va&s;t Conflux of People yearly into it, from <HI>Germ<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="3 letters"> Ireland,</HI> Numbers, who can bear Arms, are not wanting for a Defence, were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> Law for it, as there is in all the other <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies, I think, without Exception.</P>
<P>That all Government is founded on Force, and ours as well as others, will be in|di&s;putably evident from this: King <HI>Charles</HI> II. in his Grant of this Province to our Proprietor, directed, that the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> for the De&s;cent of Lands, and for the Pre&s;ervation of the Peace, &s;hould continue the &s;ame till alter'd by the Legi&s;lative Authority; and our Government continues &s;till on the &s;ame Plan, with Judges, Ju&s;tices, Sheriffs, Coroners, Clerks, Juries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all of whom, who act by Commi&s;|&s;ions, have them from the Governor in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Form; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Law is plead|ed in all our Courts, and our Practitioners copy, as near as they can, after the Prac|tice of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall.</HI> By that Law, when the Peace is commanded, even by a Con&s;table, all Obedience to that Command manife&s;tly ari&s;es from a Sen&s;e in the Per&s;on or Per&s;ons commanded, that his Re&s;i&s;tance would be puni&s;hed, and therefore they chu&s;e to avoid it: But in Civil Ca&s;es of more Importance, the Sheriff, who is the principal executive Officer, executes the Judgments of the Courts upon tho&s;e they were given again&s;t, which they are obliged to comply with, how much &s;oever again&s;t their Will; for here al&s;o they know Re&s;i&s;tance would be in vain; or if they attempt any, the Sheriff is obliged by the Law, without any Manner of Excu&s;e, to find a &s;ufficient Force, if to be had in his County, to compel to a Compliance. And in the Pleas of the Crown, be&s;ides that he is obliged to put to Death &s;uch Cri|minals as by the Law have been condemned to it, he, as general Con&s;ervator of the Peace, is likewi&s;e inve&s;ted, by the &s;ame Law, with proper Powers for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all Tumults, Riots, In&s;urrections and Rebellions, on what&s;oever Occa&s;ion they may ari&s;e, as far as the whole Po&s;&s;e or Force of his County will enable him; and for this End he receives, together with his Commi&s;&s;ion, the King's Writ of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, requiring all Per&s;ons within his Di&s;trict to be aiding to him, in the&s;e and all other Ca&s;es; by which, if Need be, they may freely u&s;e Fire-Arms, and all Manner of de&s;tructive Weapons; and are not at all accountable, by the Law, for any Lives they may take of tho&s;e in the Oppo&s;ition, any more than a Man is, on the High-Road, for killing another who attempts to rob him; and &s;uch as refu&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Sheriff, are, by the &s;ame Law, liable to Fine and Impri&s;onment: From whence it is evident, there is no Difference, in the la&s;t Re&s;ort, between Civil and Military Go|vernment; and that the Di&s;tinction that &s;ome affect to make, between the Lawful|ne&s;s of the one and of the other, is altogether groundle&s;s. As no Man is kill'd in the Field, &s;o none are puni&s;hed, with their Good-will; a &s;uperiour Force is employed in the one Ca&s;e as well as in the other; and the only Difference that I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> ever able to di&s;cover in their E&s;&s;entials, is, that the Sheriff being but one <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> his County, cannot po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;emble any very great Number together, in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> Method or Order, as in Ca&s;e of any In&s;urrection in the City of <HI>Philadelpia</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;oon appear; but on the contrary, in a regular Militia, every Per&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> Commanding Officer, and whither to repair on a proper Call. And <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> Premi&s;es it certainly follows, that whoever can find Freedom in him&s;elf, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> A&s;&s;embly in making Laws, as particularly for holding of Courts, is &s;o far concerned in Self-Defence; and makes him&s;elf e&s;&s;entially as obnoxious to Cen&s;ure, as tho&s;e who directly vote for it.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004740_0003_100DD182D73A9FF0">
But further it is alledged, that King <HI>Charles</HI> II. very well knew our Proprietor's Principles when he granted him the&s;e Powers of Government, contained in the Charter: To which 'tis an&s;wer'd, that among&s;t the other Powers granted to the Proprietor and his Deputies, He is created by the Charter a Captain General, with Power to levy War on any People not in Amity with the Crown of <HI>England;</HI> which in ca&s;e he was not free to do by him&s;elf, he might by his Deputies; and if he were in|ve&s;ted with Powers to make an inva&s;ive War, much more it was to be expected that he &s;hould defend his Country again&s;t all Invaders. And I am a Witne&s;s, that in tho&s;e two Years, or &s;omewhat le&s;s, that the Proprietor took the Admini&s;tration on him&s;elf, when la&s;t here, He found him&s;elf &s;o embara&s;&s;ed between the indi&s;pen&s;able Duties of Government on the one Hand, and his Profe&s;&s;ion on the other, that he was deter|mined, if he had &s;taid, to act by a Deputy. It is further alledged, by our Friends, that no other was expected than that this &s;hould be a Colony of <HI>Quakers,</HI> and it is &s;o reputed to this Day; that they are willing them&s;elves to rely on the &s;ole Protection of of divine Providence, and others who would not do the &s;ame &s;hould have kept out of it, for no-body called or invited them. But it is an&s;wered to this, That the King's Charter gives free Leave to all his Subjects, without Di&s;tinction, to repair to the Country and &s;ettle in it, and more particularly, the Proprietor's own Invitation was general and without Exception; and by the Laws he had pa&s;s'd him&s;elf, no Country, no Profe&s;&s;ion whatever, provided they own'd a God, were to be excluded. That 'tis true our Friends at fir&s;t made a large Majority in the Province; yet they are &s;aid now to make, on a moderate Computation, not above one Third of the Inhabitants. That altho' they alledge they cannot for Con&s;cience-&s;ake bear Arms, as being contrary to the peaceable Doctrine of JESUS (who&s;e own Di&s;ciples neverthele&s;s are known to have carried Weapons) yet, without Regard to others of CHRIST's Precepts, full as expre&s;s, again&s;t laying up Trea&s;ure in this World, and not caring for to-morrow, they are as intent as any others whatever in ama&s;&s;ing Riches, the great Bait and Temp|tation to our Enemies to come and plunder the Place; in which Friends would be far from being the only Sufferers, for their Neighbours mu&s;t equally partake with them who therefore, by all means de&s;ire a Law for a Militia, in a regular Manner to defend them&s;elves and the Country, as they have in the other Colonies. That in the la&s;t <HI>French</HI> War, <HI>Pen&s;ilvania</HI> was but an incon&s;iderable Colony; but now, by its extended Commerce, it has acquired a very great Reputation; and particularly that <HI>Philadelphia</HI> has the Name of a rich City, is known to have no manner of Fortification, and is, as has been &s;aid, a tempting Bait by Water from the Sea; and by Land, the whole Country lies expo&s;ed to the <HI>French,</HI> with whom a War is daily expected: That in their la&s;t War with <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> were &s;o greatly di&s;tre&s;s'd, by a Current of yearly Lo&s;&s;es, that they were glad to &s;it quiet where they might; but now 'tis much otherwi&s;e, as they appear rather in a Condition to give Laws to all their Neighbours: That our own <HI>Indians</HI> unhappily retiring We&s;tward, have open'd a ready R<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="3 letters"> and Communication between this Province and <HI>Canada,</HI> by their &s;ettling <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> of that great <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi;</HI> which Branch extending a thou&s;and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> from its Mouth, where it enter<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;aid River, reaches even into this Province, and between its Waters and the we&s;tern Branches of <HI>Sa&s;quchannah</HI> there is but a &s;mall Land-Carriage: That the <HI>French</HI> exceedingly want &s;uch a Country as this to &s;upply their I&s;lands with Provi&s;ions, and our Rivers for an ea&s;ier Inlet to that va&s;t Country of <HI>Loui&s;iana,</HI> which they po&s;&s;e&s;s on <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi,</HI> than they now have by the barr'd Mouth of it, which empties it&s;elf a great Way within the Shoal-Bay of <HI>Mexico;</HI> and they have many large Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> in Alliance with them to facilitate their Conque&s;ts. For the which Rea&s;ons, our numerous back Inhabitants, as well as others, ought to be obliged to furni&s;h them&s;elves with Arms, and to be di&s;ciplined as in other Colonies for their own proper Defence, which would be no manner of Charge to the Publick, and but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P>The&s;e, I think, are the principal Arguments adduced by tho&s;e who plead for a Law for Self-Defence: To which I &s;hall add the&s;e other weighty Con&s;iderations, that may more
<PB N="4" REF="004740_0004_100DD18494948A18">particularly affect Friends as a People; The Government at Home, and particularly the Parliament, appear to have this pre&s;ent War very much at Heart, in which they &s;pare no Charge in fitting out large Fleets, with Land-Forces, and expect that all their Colonies will in the &s;ame Manner exert them&s;elves, as the A&s;&s;emblies of all the others have in &s;ome Mea&s;ure done, ours excepted, not only in their Contributions, but they have al&s;o generally a regular Militia for their Defence.</P>
<P>Our Friends have recommended them&s;elves to the Government in <HI>Britain,</HI> not on|ly by their peaceable Deportment, as has been already ob&s;erved, but by complying with its Demands, in chearfully contributing by the Payment of their Taxes towards every War; yet they are admitted into no Offices of the Government above tho&s;e of the re&s;pective Pari&s;hes where they live, except that &s;ome have undertaken to re|ceive the Publick Money; and tho' tolerated in their Opinions, as they interfere not with the Admini&s;tration, yet the&s;e Opinions are &s;o far from being approved by the Government, that when they &s;hall be urged as a Negative to putting &s;o valuable a Country as this, and &s;cituate, as has been mentioned, in a proper Po&s;ture of Defence, tho&s;e who plead their Privileges for &s;uch a Negative, may undoubtedly expect to be dive&s;ted of them, either by Act of Parliament, or a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> from the King again&s;t their Charters; for it will be accounted equal to betraying it. And this, be&s;ides the irreparable Lo&s;s to our&s;elves, mu&s;t prove a Reproach, and va&s;t Di&s;ad|vantage to the Profe&s;&s;ion every where.</P>
<P>'Tis alledged, the Governor made a fal&s;e Step la&s;t Year in Encouraging or Suffering our Servants to inli&s;t; for which he has been abridged by the A&s;&s;embly of the Salary, for a Year and a half, that has for many Years before been allowed to our Governors. But as this is interpreted by the Mini&s;try in <HI>Britain,</HI> as a Proof of an extraordinary Zeal for the King's Service, his Conduct herein, as al&s;o his Let|ter to the Board of Trade, however di&s;plea&s;ing to us, will undoubtedly recommend him the more to the Regard of our Superiors, in who&s;e Power we are; and accord|ingly we may expect to hear of it.</P>
<P>Our Province is now rent into Parties, and in a mo&s;t unchri&s;tian Manner <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> Love and Charity, the great Characteri&s;ticks of the Chri&s;tian Religion, are in a great Mea&s;ure bani&s;hed from among&s;t the People, and Contention too generally prevails. But, for the weighty Rea&s;ons that have been mentioned in this Paper, it is not to be doubted but that tho&s;e who are for a Law for Defence, if the War continues, and the Country be not ruin'd by an Enemy before, mu&s;t in Time obtain it: It is therefore propo&s;ed to the &s;erious and mo&s;t weighty Con&s;ideration of this Meeting, Whether it may not, at this Time, be advi&s;eable, that all &s;uch who for Con&s;cience-&s;ake cannot join in any Law for Self-Defence, &s;hould not only decline &s;tanding Candidates at the en&s;uing Election for Repre&s;entatives them&s;elves, but al&s;o advi&s;e all others who are equally &s;crupulous, to do the &s;ame; and as Animo&s;ities and Faction have greatly prevailed among&s;t us of late, and at all Times there prevails with too many an ill|judged, par&s;imonious Di&s;po&s;ition, who <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> Rea&s;on than to &s;ave <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> Money, but probably on &s;ome other Pretence, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> Oppo&s;ition to the Governor, may mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;hould give out publickly before hand, when they find they are named, that they will by no means &s;erve tho' cho&s;en; and accordingly that the Meeting recommend this to the Deputies from the &s;everal Monthly or Quarterly Meetings in this Province. All which, from the &s;incere&s;t Zeal for the Publick Good, Peace of the Country, and not only the Reputation, but the mo&s;t &s;olid Intere&s;t of Friends as a People, is (I &s;ay again) mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly recommended to your Con&s;ideration, by</P>
