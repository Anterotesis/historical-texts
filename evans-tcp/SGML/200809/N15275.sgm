<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AN attack is made on the credit and in&s;titution of the Bank of North-America. Whether this at|tack is ju&s;tified by the principles of law and &s;ound policy, is a natural &s;ubject of enquiry. The en|quiry is as nece&s;&s;ary and intere&s;ting, as it is natural: For, though &s;ome people repre&s;ent the Bank as injurious and dangerous, while others con&s;ider it as &s;alutary and beneficial, to the community, all view it as an object of high importance; de&s;erving and demanding the public attention.</P>
<P>IN the inve&s;tigation of this &s;ubject, it will be requi&s;ite to di&s;cu&s;s &s;ome great and leading que&s;tions concerning the con&s;titution of the United States, and the relation, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between them and each particular State in the union. Perhaps it is to be wi&s;hed that this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion had not been rendered nece&s;&s;ary; and that tho&s;e que|&s;tions had re&s;ted &s;ome time longer among the <HI>arcana im|perii:</HI> But they are now pre&s;ented to the public; and the public &s;hould view them with firmne&s;s, with impar|tiality, and with all the &s;olicitude befitting &s;uch a mo|mentous occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>A GENTLEMAN,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide the preface to the Statement of the accounts of the United States.</HI></NOTE> who had the be&s;t opportunities of ob&s;erving, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the be&s;t talents for judging on the &s;ubject, informs his fellow-citizens officially, that <Q>it may be not only <HI>a&s;&s;erted,</HI> but <HI>demon&s;trated,</HI> that, without the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>National</HI> Bank, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the department of finance could not have been performed</Q> in the late war.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Millennium</HI> is not yet come. War, with all the horrors and mi&s;eries in his train, may re-vi&s;it us. The
<PB N="4" REF="019388_0003_0FAB48122C4659C0">
finances may again be deranged: <Q>Public credit may, again, be at an end: No means may be afforded ade|quate to the public expences.</Q> Is it wi&s;e or politic to deprive our country, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, of a re&s;ource, which happy experience has &s;hewn to be of &s;uch <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> importance? Will the citizens of the United States be encouraged to embark their fortunes on a &s;imilar bottom in a future war, by &s;eeing the ve&s;&s;el, which carried us &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully through the la&s;t, thrown a&s;ide, like an u&s;e|le&s;s hulk, upon the return of peace?</P>
<P>IT will not be improper to recall to our remembrance the origin, the e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the proceedings of the Bank of North-America.</P>
<P>IN May, 1781, the Superintendant of Finance laid before Congre&s;s a plan of a Bank. On the 26th of that month Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed the following re&s;olution concern|ing it.</P>
<P>"RESOLVED, That Congre&s;s do approve of the plan for <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hing</HI> a <HI>National Bank</HI> in <HI>the&s;e United States,</HI> &s;ub|mitted to their con&s;ideration by Mr. Robert Morris, the 17th May, 1781, and that they will promote and &s;up|port the &s;ame by &s;uch ways and means, from time to time, as may appear nece&s;&s;ary for the in&s;titution, and con&s;i&s;tent with the public good.</P>
<P>"THAT the &s;ub&s;cribers to the &s;aid Bank SHALL BE INCORPORATED, agreeably to the principles and terms of the plan, under the name of <HI>the Pre&s;ident, Directors and Company of the Bank of North-America,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as the &s;ub&s;cription &s;hall be filled, the Directors and Pre&s;ident cho&s;en, <HI>and application made to</HI> CONGRESS <HI>for that pur|po&s;e,</HI> by the Pre&s;ident and Directors elected.</P>
<P>"RESOLVED, That it be <HI>recommended</HI> to the &s;everal States, by proper laws for that purpo&s;e, to provide that no other Bank or Bankers &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed or permitted within the &s;aid States re&s;pectively during the war.</P>
<P>"RESOLVED, That the notes hereafter to be i&s;&s;ued by the &s;aid Bank, payable on demand, <HI>&s;hall be receiva|ble</HI> in payment of all taxes, duties and debts, due or that may become due or payable to the United States.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="019388_0004_0FAB4812EC8AAA08">
"RESOLVED, That Congre&s;s will <HI>recommend</HI> to the &s;everal legi&s;latures to pa&s;s laws, making it felony without benefit of clergy, for any per&s;on to counterfeit Bank Notes, or to pa&s;s &s;uch notes, knowing them to be coun|terfeit; al&s;o making it felony without benefit of clergy, for any Pre&s;ident, In&s;pector, Director, Officer or servant of the Bank, to convert any of the property, money or credit of the &s;aid Bank to his own u&s;e, or in any other way to be guilty of fraud or embezzlement, as officers or &s;ervants of the Bank."</P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e re&s;olutions a &s;ub&s;cription was opened for the <HI>National Bank:</HI> This &s;ub&s;cription was not confined to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania:</HI> The citizens of <HI>other</HI> States tru&s;ted their property to the public faith; and before the end of De|cember, 1781, the &s;ub&s;cription was filled, "from an expectation of a charter of incorporation from Congre&s;s." Application was made to Congre&s;s by the Pre&s;ident and Directors, then cho&s;en, for an act of incorporation. "The EXIGENCIES <HI>of the United States</HI> rendered it <HI>in|di&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary</HI> that &s;uch an act &s;hould be immediately pa&s;&s;ed."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the act in the appendix.</HI></NOTE> Congre&s;s&punc; at the &s;ame time that they PASSED the <HI>act of incorporation,</HI> RECOMMENDED to the legi&s;lature of each State, to pa&s;s &s;uch laws as they might judge ne|ce&s;&s;ary for giving its <HI>ordinance</HI> its full operation, agree|ably to the true intent and meaning thereof, and accord|ing to the <HI>recommendations</HI> contained in the re&s;olution of the 26th day of May preceding.</P>
<P>THE Bank immediately commenced its operations. Its &s;eeds were &s;mall, but they were vigorous. The &s;ums paid in by individuals upon their &s;ub&s;criptions did not amount, in the whole, to &s;eventy thou&s;and dollars. The &s;um inve&s;ted by the United States, in bank &s;tock, a|mounted to &s;omething more than two hundred and fifty thou&s;and dollars: But this &s;um may be &s;aid to have been paid in with one hand and borrowed with the other; and before the end of the fir&s;t three months farther &s;ums were advanced to the United States, and an advance

was made to this State.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See in the appendix the different &s;ums advanced to this &s;tate.</HI></NOTE> Be&s;ides, numerous accommoda|tions were afforded to individuals. Little was it then imagined that the Bank would ever be repre&s;ented as un|friendly to circulation. It was viewed as the &s;ource and as the &s;upport of credit, both private and public: As &s;uch, it was hated and dreaded by the enemies of the United States: As &s;uch, it was loved and fo&s;tered by their friends.</P>
<P>PENNSYLVANIA, di&s;tingui&s;hed on numerous occa&s;ions by her faithful and affectionate attachment to foederal principles, embraced, in the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of her legi&s;lature after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Bank, the opportunity of te&s;tifying her approbation of an act, which had been found to be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. Harmonizing with the &s;entiments and <HI>recommendations</HI> of the United States, the A&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed an act,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">18<HI>th March,</HI> 1782.</NOTE> "for preventing and pu|ni&s;hing the counterfeiting of the <HI>common &s;eal,</HI> bank bills and bank notes, of the <HI>Pre&s;ident, Directors and Company</HI> of the <HI>Bank</HI> of <HI>North-America."</HI> In the preamble to this act, which, according to the con&s;titution of this &s;tate, expre&s;&s;es the rea&s;ons and motives for pa&s;&s;ing it, the "NE|CESSITY" of taking "EFFECTUAL mea&s;ures for pre|venting and puni&s;hing frauds and cheats which may be put upon the <HI>Pre&s;ident, Directors and Company</HI> of the BANK of NORTH-AMERICA," is <HI>explicitly</HI> DECLARED by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>THE &s;entiments and conduct of other &s;tates, re&s;pect|ing the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the National Bank by Congre&s;s, were &s;imilar to tho&s;e of Penn&s;ylvania. The General A&s;|&s;embly of Rhode-I&s;land and Providence Plantations<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>January Se&s;&s;ions,</HI> 1782.</NOTE> made it felony, without benefit of Clergy, "to coun|terfeit any note or notes i&s;&s;ued, or to be i&s;&s;ued, from the <HI>Bank of North-America,</HI> as approved and ESTABLISHED <HI>by the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled."</HI> The &s;tate of Connecticut enacted,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">10<HI>th January,</HI> 1782.</NOTE> that a tax &s;hould be laid, payable in money, or "notes i&s;&s;ued by the Directors of the <HI>Na|tional
<PB N="7" REF="019388_0006_0FAB48146BFD5658">
Bank,</HI> ESTABLISHED <HI>by an ordinance of the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled."</HI> By a law of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, the &s;ub&s;cribers to the National Bank, approved of by the United States, were "incorporated, on the behalf of that commonwealth, by the name of the Pre&s;ident, Di|rectors and Company of the Bank of North-America, <HI>according to the terms of the</HI> ORDINANCE TO INCORPO|RATE THE SAID SUBSCRIBERS, pa&s;&s;ed by the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled on the thirty-fir&s;t day of December, 1781." The &s;ame law further enacts, "that all notes or bills, which have been or &s;hall be i&s;&s;ued by, for, or in the name of the &s;aid Pre&s;ident, Directors and Company, and payable on demand, &s;hall be receivable in the payment of all taxes, debts and duties, due or that may become due, or payable to, or for account of, the &s;aid United States." In the preamble of this law, the legi&s;lature <HI>declares</HI> that "a National Bank is of great &s;ervice, as well to the public as to individuals."</P>
<P>THE Pre&s;ident and Directors of the Bank had a deli|cate and a difficult part to act. On one hand, they were obliged to guard again&s;t the malice and exertions of their enemies: On the other, it was incumbent on them to &s;ooth the timidity of &s;ome of their friends. The credit of a Bank, as well as all other credit, depends on opi|nion. Opinion, whether well or ill founded, produces, in each ca&s;e, the &s;ame effects upon conduct. Some thought that an act of incorporation from the legi&s;lature of this &s;tate would be <HI>beneficial;</HI> none apprehended that it could ever be <HI>hurtful</HI> to the National Bank. Pru|dence, therefore, and a di&s;po&s;ition, very natural in that &s;ea&s;on of doubt and diffidence, to gratify the &s;entiments, and even the prejudices, of &s;uch as might become &s;ub|&s;cribers or cu&s;tomers to the Bank, directed an application to the A&s;&s;embly for "a charter, &s;imilar to that granted by the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled." But tho' the Directors were willing to avail them&s;elves of encou|ragement from every quarter, they meant not to relin|qui&s;h any of their rights, or to change the foundation on which they re&s;ted. They made their application in their

<HI>corporate</HI> character.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Their letter to the Pre&s;ident of the Supreme Executive Council, on this occa&s;ion, is in the appendix.</HI></NOTE> They expre&s;ly mentioned to the A&s;|&s;embly, that the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled had granted to the Bank a charter of incorporation, and that the in&s;titution was to be carried on under THEIR IMME|DIATE AUSPICES. The legi&s;lature thought that it was proper and rea&s;onable to grant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1<HI>&s;t April,</HI> 1782.</NOTE> the reque&s;t of the <HI>Pre|&s;ident and Directors of the Bank of North-America;</HI> and a&s;&s;igned, as a rea&s;on for the act, "that the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, from a <HI>conviction</HI> of the &s;upport which the <HI>finances of the</HI> UNITED STATES would receive from the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> of a NATIONAL BANK, pa&s;&s;ed an ordinance to incorporate the &s;ub&s;cribers <HI>for this purpo&s;e,</HI> by the name and &s;tile of the Pre&s;ident, Directors and Company of the Bank of North-America."</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t clau&s;e of the law enacts, that "tho&s;e who are, and tho&s;e who <HI>&s;hall become</HI> &s;ub&s;cribers to <HI>the &s;aid Bank,</HI> be, and FOR EVER HEREAFTER SHALL BE, a corporation and body politic, to all intents and purpo&s;es."</P>
<P>IT is further enacted, that "the &s;aid corporation be, and <HI>&s;hall be for ever hereafter,</HI> able and capable in law to do and execute all and &s;ingular matters and things, that to them &s;hall or may appertain to do."</P>
<P>To &s;how, in the mo&s;t &s;triking light, the kind &s;entiments of the legi&s;lature towards the in&s;titution, it is further enacted, that "this act &s;hall be con&s;trued and taken mo&s;t <HI>favourably</HI> and <HI>beneficially</HI> for the &s;aid corporation."</P>
<P>ON the&s;e facts and proceedings, two que&s;tions of much national importance pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our view and examination.</P>
<P>I. IS THE Bank of North America legally and con&s;ti|tutionally in&s;tituted and organi&s;ed, by the charter of in|corporation granted by the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled?</P>
<P>II. WOULD it be wi&s;e or politic in the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, to revoke the charter which it has granted to the in&s;titution?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="019388_0008_0FAB4815ECDBAC50">
THE di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e two que&s;tions will naturally lead us to the proper conclu&s;ions concerning the VALIDI|TY and the UTILITY of the Bank.</P>
<P>I. HAD the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled a legal and con&s;titutional power to in&s;titute and organi&s;e the Bank of North-America, by a charter of incorporation?</P>
<P>THE objection, under this head, will be&mdash;that the articles of confederation expre&s;s all the powers of Con|gre&s;s, that in tho&s;e articles no power is delegated to that body to grant charters of incorporation, and that, there|fore, Congre&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;s no &s;uch power.</P>
<P>IT is true, that, by the &s;econd article of the confede|ration, "each State retains its &s;overeignty, freedom and independence, and every power, juri&s;diction and right, which is not, by the confederation, <HI>expre&s;ly</HI> delegated to the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled."</P>
<P>IF, then, <HI>any</HI> or <HI>each</HI> of the States po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, previous to the confederation, a power, juri&s;diction or right, to in&s;titute and organi&s;e, by a charter of incorporation, a Bank for North-America; in other words&mdash;commen&s;u|rate to the United States; &s;uch power, juri&s;diction and right, unle&s;s expre&s;ly delegated to Congre&s;s, cannot be legally or con&s;titutionally exerci&s;ed by that body.</P>
<P>BUT, we pre&s;ume, it will not be contended, that <HI>any</HI> or <HI>each</HI> of the States could exerci&s;e any power or act of &s;overeignty extending <HI>over</HI> all the other States, or <HI>any</HI> of them; or, in other words, incorporate a Bank, com|men&s;urate to the United States.</P>
<P>THE con&s;equence is, that this is not an act of &s;ove|reignty, or a power, juri&s;diction or right, which, by the &s;econd article of the confederation, mu&s;t be <HI>expre&s;ly</HI> dele|gated to Congre&s;s, in order to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that body.</P>
<P>IF, however, <HI>any</HI> per&s;on &s;hall contend that <HI>any</HI> or each of the States can exerci&s;e &s;uch an exten&s;ive power or act of &s;overeignty as that above mentioned; to <HI>&s;uch</HI> per&s;on we give this an&s;wer&mdash;The State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts has ex|erci&s;ed &s;uch power and act: It has incorporated the Bank of North-America. But to pur&s;ue my argument.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="019388_0009_0FAB4816AC8FF968">
THOUGH the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled de|rive <HI>from the particular States</HI> no power, juri&s;diction or right, which is not <HI>expre&s;ly</HI> delegated by the confedera|tion, it does not <HI>thence</HI> follow, that the United States in Congre&s;s have <HI>no other</HI> powers, juri&s;diction or rights, than <HI>tho&s;e</HI> delegated by the <HI>particular States.</HI></P>
<P>THE United States have <HI>general</HI> rights, <HI>general</HI> powers, and <HI>general</HI> obligations, not derived from <HI>any</HI> particular States, nor from <HI>all</HI> the particular States, taken <HI>&s;eparate|ly;</HI> but <HI>re&s;ulting from the union of the whole:</HI> And, therefore, it is provided, in the fifth article of the confe|deration, <Q>that for the more convenient management of the GENERAL INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES, delegates &s;hall be annually appointed to meet in Con|gre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>To many purpo&s;es, the United States are to be con&s;i|dered as one <HI>undivided, independent</HI> nation; and as po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>all the rights,</HI> and <HI>powers,</HI> and <HI>properties,</HI> by the law of nations <HI>incident</HI> to &s;uch.</P>
<P>WHENEVER an object occurs, to the direction of which no particular &s;tate is competent, the management of it mu&s;t, <HI>of nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> belong to the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled. There are many objects of this ex|tended nature. The purcha&s;e, the &s;ale, the defence, and the government of lands and countries, <HI>not</HI> WITHIN ANY <HI>State,</HI> are all included under this de&s;cription. An in&s;titution for <HI>circulating paper,</HI> and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hing its credit over the whole United States,</HI> is naturally ranged in the &s;ame cla&s;s.</P>
<P>THE act of independence was made before the articles of confederation. This act <HI>declares,</HI> that <HI>"the&s;e</HI> UNIT|ED <HI>Colonies,"</HI> (not enumerating them &s;eparately) <HI>"are</HI> free and independent States; and that, as free and inde|pendent States, THEY have full power to do <HI>all</HI> acts and things which independent States may, of right, do."</P>
<P>THE confederation was not intended to weaken or abridge the <HI>powers</HI> and <HI>rights,</HI> to which the United States were <HI>previou&s;ly</HI> entitled. It was not intended to transfer any of tho&s;e powers or rights to the <HI>particular</HI> States, or
<PB N="11" REF="019388_0010_0FAB48176F92ECB0">
any of them. If, therefore, the power now in que&s;tion was ve&s;ted in the United States before the confederation; it continues ve&s;ted in them &s;till. The confederation clothed the United States with many (though, perhaps, not with &s;ufficient) powers: But of none did it di&s;robe them.</P>
<P>IT is no <HI>new</HI> po&s;ition, that rights may be ve&s;ted in a political body, which did not previou&s;ly re&s;ide in <HI>any</HI> or in <HI>all</HI> the members of that body. They may be derived &s;olely from <HI>the</HI> UNION <HI>of tho&s;e members.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Burlamaqui, p.</HI> 42.</NOTE> "THE ca&s;e," &s;ays the celebrated Burlamaqui, <Q>is here very near the &s;ame as in that of &s;everal voices collected together, which, <HI>by their union,</HI> produce a harmony, that was <HI>not</HI> to be found <HI>&s;eparately in each.</HI></Q></P>
<P>A NUMBER of unconnected inhabitants are &s;ettled on each &s;ide of a navigable river; it belongs to <HI>none</HI> of them; it belongs not to them <HI>all,</HI> for they have nothing in common: Let them unite; the river is the property of the united body.</P>
<P>THE arguments drawn from the political a&s;&s;ociations of <HI>individuals</HI> into a <HI>&s;tate</HI> will apply, with equal force and propriety, to a <HI>number of &s;tates</HI> united by a <HI>confede|racy.</HI></P>
<P>NEW &s;tates mu&s;t be FORMED and e&s;tabli&s;hed; their extent and boundaries mu&s;t be regulated and a&s;certained. How can this be done, unle&s;s by the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled?</P>
<P>STATES are corporations or bodies politic of the mo&s;t important and dignified kind.</P>
<P>LET us now concenter the foregoing ob&s;ervations, and apply them to the incorporation of the Bank of North-America by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>BY the <HI>civil law,</HI> corporations &s;eem to have been created by the mere and voluntary a&s;&s;ociation of their members, provided &s;uch convention was not contrary to law.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Black&s;tone,</HI> 472.</NOTE></P>
<P>BY the <HI>common law,</HI> &s;omething more is nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;All the methods whereby corporations exi&s;t are, for the
<PB N="12" REF="019388_0011_0FAB481832D3FE50">
mo&s;t part, reducible to that of the king's letters patents, or charter of incorporation.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Black&s;tone,</HI> 472, 473.</NOTE></P>
<P>FROM this it will appear that the creation of a corpo|ration is, by the common law, con&s;idered as the act of the executive rather than of the legi&s;lative powers of government.</P>
<P>BEFORE the revolution charters of incorporation were granted by the proprietaries of Penn&s;ylvania, under a derivative authority from the crown, and tho&s;e charters have been recognized by the <HI>con&s;titution</HI> and <HI>laws</HI> of the commonwealth &s;ince the revolution.</P>
<P>FROM analogy, therefore, we may ju&s;tly infer, that the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the executive powers of the union, may, in virtue of &s;uch powers, grant charters of incorparation for accompli&s;h|ing objects that comprehend the <HI>general intere&s;ts</HI> of the United States.</P>
<P>BUT the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled po&s;&s;e&s;s, in many in&s;tances, and to many purpo&s;es, the legi&s;lative as well as the executive powers of the union; and there|fore, whether we con&s;ider the incorporation of the Bank as a <HI>law,</HI> or as a <HI>charter,</HI> it will be equally within the powers of Congre&s;s: For the object of this in&s;titution could not be reached without the exertion of the <HI>combined &s;overeignty</HI> of the union.</P>
<P>I HAVE a&s;ked&mdash;How can new &s;tates, which are bodies politic, be formed, unle&s;s by the United States in Con|gre&s;s a&s;&s;embled? Fact, as well as argument, ju&s;tifies my &s;entiments on this &s;ubject. The conduct of Congre&s;s has been &s;imilar on &s;imilar occa&s;ions. The &s;ame princi|ples have directed the exerci&s;e of the &s;ame powers.</P>
<P>IN the month of April, 1784, Congre&s;s re&s;olved, that part of the we&s;tern territory "&s;hould be divided into di&s;tinct &s;tates."</P>
<P>THEY further re&s;olved, that the &s;ettlers &s;hould, "ei|ther on their own petition, or on the order of Congre&s;s, <HI>receive authority from</HI> THEM to meet together, for the

purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing a temporary government, to adopt the con&s;titution and laws of <HI>any one of the original &s;tates."</HI></P>
<P>"WHEN any &s;uch &s;tate &s;hall have acquired twenty thou&s;and free inhabitants, on giving due proof thereof to Congre&s;s, they <HI>&s;hall receive from</HI> THEM <HI>authority</HI> to call a Convention of repre&s;entatives, to e&s;tabli&s;h a permanent con&s;titution and government for them&s;elves."</P>
<P>"THE preceding articles," among others, "&s;hall be formed into a CHARTER <HI>of compact,</HI> &s;hall be duly exe|cuted by the Pre&s;ident of the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, under his hand and the &s;eal of the United States; &s;hall be promulgated, and &s;hall &s;tand as <HI>funda|mental Con&s;titutions</HI> between the thirteen original &s;tates, and each of the <HI>&s;everal &s;tates</HI> NOW NEWLY DESCRIBED, unalienable from and after the &s;ale of any part of the territory of &s;uch &s;tate, but by the <HI>joint</HI> con&s;ent of the <HI>United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled,</HI> and <HI>of the particular &s;tate</HI> within which &s;uch alteration is propo&s;ed to be made."</P>
<P>IT will be difficult, I believe, to urge again&s;t the power of Congre&s;s to grant a charter to the Bank of North-America, any argument, which may not, with equal &s;trength and fitne&s;s, be urged again&s;t the power of that body to form, execute and promulgate a charter of compact for the <HI>New States.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;entiments of the repre&s;entatives of the United States, as to their power of incorporating the Bank, ought to have much weight with us. Their &s;entiments are &s;trongly marked by their conduct, in their fir&s;t re&s;o|lutions re&s;pecting the Bank. The&s;e re&s;olutions are made at the <HI>&s;ame time,</HI> and on the <HI>&s;ame &s;ubject:</HI> But there is a <HI>&s;triking difference</HI> in their <HI>manner.</HI> It was thought proper "that no other Bank &s;hould be permitted within any of the &s;tates, during the war." Congre&s;s "RECOMMEND|ED to the &s;everal &s;tates to make provi&s;ion, for that pur|po&s;e, by proper laws." It was thought prudent that the Bank &s;hould be protected, by penal laws, from fraud, embezzlement and forgery. Congre&s;s RECOMMENDED it to the &s;everal Legi&s;latures to pa&s;s &s;uch laws. It was
<PB N="14" REF="019388_0013_0FAB4819AD1F73E0">
deemed expedient that bank notes &s;hould be received in payment of &s;ums payable to the United States: Congre&s;s RESOLVE, that the notes "SHALL BE RECEIVABLE" in &s;uch payments. It was judged nece&s;&s;ary that the Bank &s;hould have a charter of incorporation: Congre&s;s RE|SOLVE, that the Bank "SHALL BE INCORPORATED," on application made "TO CONGRESS" for that purpo&s;e. The line of di&s;tinction between tho&s;e things in which Congre&s;s could only <HI>recommend,</HI> and tho&s;e in which they could <HI>act,</HI> is drawn in the cleare&s;t manner. The incor|poration of the National Bank is ranked among tho&s;e things, in which they could <HI>act.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>act</HI> of Congre&s;s has, either expre&s;ly, or by im|plication, received the approbation of every &s;tate in the union. It was <HI>officially</HI> announced to every &s;tate by the Superintendant of Finance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See his letter in the appendix.</HI></NOTE> Had any one &s;tate con&s;i|dered it as an exerci&s;e of u&s;urped power, would not that &s;tate have remon&s;trated again&s;t it? But there is no &s;uch remon&s;trance.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>act</HI> of Congre&s;s has been mo&s;t explicitly recog|ni&s;ed by the Legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania. The law for preventing and puni&s;hing frauds and cheats upon the Bank was pa&s;&s;ed on the 18th of March, 1782, and <HI>be|fore</HI> the Bank had obtained a charter from this &s;tate. By that law it is made felony without benefit of clergy, to forge the common &s;eal of the Pre&s;ident, Directors and Company of the Bank of North-America. Who were the Pre&s;ident, Directors and Company of the Bank of North-America? Tho&s;e whom Congre&s;s had made "a corporation and body politic, <HI>to all intents and purpo&s;es,</HI> BY THAT NAME AND STILE." How came that body by a "common &s;eal?" The act of Congre&s;s ordained that that body "&s;hould have full power and authority to <HI>make, have</HI> and <HI>u&s;e</HI> a COMMON SEAL." In the act to incorpo|rate the &s;ub&s;cribers to the Bank of North-America, the Legi&s;lature, after reciting that the United States in Con|gre&s;s a&s;&s;embled had "pa&s;&s;ed an ordinance to incorpo|rate them," &s;ay, "the Pre&s;ident and Directors of the
<PB N="15" REF="019388_0014_0FAB481A6C394DE8">
&s;aid Bank have applied to this Hou&s;e for a <HI>&s;imilar act of incorporation,</HI> which reque&s;t it is <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> to grant."</P>
<P>WHEN the foregoing facts and arguments are con&s;i|dered, compared and weighed, they will, it is hoped, evince and e&s;tabli&s;h, <HI>&s;atisfactorily to all,</HI> and <HI>conclu&s;ively</HI> on the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, the truth of this po&s;i|tion&mdash;That the Bank of North-America was legally and con&s;titutionally in&s;tituted and organi&s;ed, by the charter of incorporation granted by the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>II. WOULD it, then, be wi&s;e or politic in the legi&s;la|ture of Penn&s;ylvania, to revoke the charter which it has granted to this in&s;titution? It would not be wi&s;e or po|litic&mdash;</P>
<P>1&s;t. BECAUSE the proceeding would be nugatory. The recall of the charter of Penn&s;ylvania would not re|peal that of the United States, by which we have proved the Bank to be legally and con&s;titutionally in&s;tituted and organi&s;ed.</P>
<P>2d. BECAUSE, though the legi&s;lature may de&s;troy the legi&s;lative <HI>operation,</HI> yet it cannot undo the legi&s;lative <HI>ac|knowledgment</HI> of <HI>its own act.</HI> Though a &s;tatute be re|pealed, yet it &s;hews the &s;en&s;e and opinion of the legi&s;la|ture concerning the &s;ubject of it, in the &s;ame manner as if it continued in force.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fo&s;ter,</HI> 394.</NOTE> The legi&s;lature declared, in the law, that it was <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> to grant the re|que&s;t of the Pre&s;ident and Directors of the Bank, for an act of incorporation &s;imilar to the ordinance of Con|gre&s;s: No repeal of the law can weaken the force of that declaration.</P>
<P>3d. BECAUSE &s;uch a proceeding would wound that confidence in the engagements of government, which it is &s;o much the intere&s;t and duty of every &s;tate to encou|rage and reward. The act in que&s;tion formed a charter of compact between the Legi&s;lature of this &s;tate, and the Pre&s;ident, Directors and Company of the Bank of North-America. The latter <HI>a&s;ked</HI> for nothing but what was
<PB N="16" REF="019388_0015_0FAB481B2CC65F30">
<HI>proper</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onable:</HI> The former <HI>granted</HI> nothing but what was <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onable:</HI> The terms of the com|pact were, therefore, fair and hone&s;t: While the&s;e terms are ob&s;erved on one &s;ide, the compact cannot, con&s;i&s;tent|ly with the rules of good faith, be departed from on the other.</P>
<P>IT may be a&s;ked&mdash;Has not the &s;tate power over her own laws?&mdash;May &s;he not alter, amend, extend, re&s;train and repeal them at her plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>I AM far from oppo&s;ing the legi&s;lative authority of the &s;tate: But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that, according to the practice of the legi&s;lature, public acts of very <HI>different kinds</HI> are drawn and promulgated under the <HI>&s;ame form.</HI> A law to ve&s;t or confirm an e&s;tate in an individual&mdash;a law to incorporate a congregation or other &s;ociety&mdash;a law re&s;pecting the rights and properties of all the citizens of the &s;tate&mdash;are all pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner; are all cloth|ed in the &s;ame dre&s;s of legi&s;lative formality; and are all equally acts of the Repre&s;entatives of the Freemen of the commonwealth. But &s;urely it will not be pretended, that, after laws of tho&s;e different kinds are pa&s;&s;ed, the legi&s;lature po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es over each the &s;ame di&s;cretionary power of repeal. In a law re&s;pecting the rights and properties of all the citizens of the &s;tate, this power may be &s;afely exerci&s;ed by the legi&s;lature. Why? Becau&s;e, in this ca&s;e, the intere&s;t of tho&s;e who make the law (the members of A&s;&s;embly and their con&s;tituents) and the intere&s;t of tho&s;e who are to be affected by the law (the members of A&s;&s;embly and their con&s;tituents) is the &s;ame. It is a common cau&s;e, and may, therefore, be &s;afely tru&s;ted to the Repre&s;entatives of the community. None can hurt another, without, at the &s;ame time, hurt|ing him&s;elf. Very different is the ca&s;e with regard to a law, by which the &s;tate grants privileges to a congrega|tion or other &s;ociety. Here two parties are in&s;tituted, and two di&s;tinct intere&s;ts &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Rules of ju&s;tice, of faith, and of honor, mu&s;t, therefore, be e&s;tabli&s;hed be|tween them: For, if <HI>intere&s;t</HI> alone is to be viewed, the congregation or &s;ociety mu&s;t always lie at the mercy of
<PB N="17" REF="019388_0016_0FAB481BEBE7A790">
the community. Still more different is the ca&s;e with re|gard to a law, by which an e&s;tate is ve&s;ted or confirmed in an individual: If, in this ca&s;e, the legi&s;lature may at di&s;cretion, and without any rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned, dive&s;t or de|&s;troy his e&s;tate, then a per&s;on &s;eized of an e&s;tate in fee-&s;imple, under legi&s;lative &s;anction, is, in truth, nothing more than a &s;olemn tenant at will.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e rea&s;ons, whenever the objects and makers of an in&s;trument, pa&s;&s;ed under the form of a law, are not the &s;ame, it is to be con&s;idered as a compact, and to be interpreted according to the rules and maxims, by which compacts are governed. A foreigner is natura|lized by law: Is he a citizen only during plea&s;ure? He is no more, if, without any cau&s;e of forfeiture a&s;&s;igned and e&s;tabli&s;hed, the law, by which he is naturalized, may at plea&s;ure be repealed. To receive the legi&s;lative &s;tamp of &s;tability and permanency, acts of incorporation are applied for from the legi&s;lature. If the&s;e acts may be repealed without notice, without accu&s;ation, without hearing, without proof, without forfeiture; where is the &s;tamp of their &s;tability? Their motto &s;hould be, "LEVI|TY." If the act for incorporating the &s;ub&s;cribers to the Bank of North-America &s;hall be repealed in this manner, a precedent will be e&s;tabli&s;hed for repealing, in the &s;ame manner, every other legi&s;lative charter in Penn|&s;ylvania. A pretence, as &s;pecious as any that can be al|ledged on this occa&s;ion, will never be wanting on any future occa&s;ion. Tho&s;e acts of the &s;tate, which have hitherto been con&s;idered as the &s;ure anchors of privilege and of property, will become the &s;port of every varying gu&s;t of politics, and will float wildly backwards and forwards on the irregular and impetuous tides of party and faction.</P>
<P>4th. IT would not be wi&s;e or politic to repeal the charter granted by this &s;tate to the Bank of North Ame|rica, becau&s;e &s;uch a mea&s;ure would operate, as far as it would have any operation, again&s;t the credit of the United States, on which the intere&s;t of this common|wealth and her citizens &s;o e&s;&s;entially depends. This in|&s;titution
<PB N="18" REF="019388_0017_0FAB481CB00F5458">
originated under the au&s;pices of the United States: The &s;ub&s;cription to the National Bank was open|ed under the recommendations and the engagements of Congre&s;s: Citizens of this &s;tate, and of the other &s;tates, and foreigners, have become &s;tock-holders, on the public faith: The United States have pledged them&s;elves <Q>to promote and &s;upport the in&s;titution by &s;uch ways and means, from time to time, as may appear nece&s;&s;ary for it, and con&s;i&s;tent with the public good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">26<HI>th May,</HI> 1781.</NOTE></Q> They have recommended to the legi&s;lature of <HI>each</HI> &s;tate, <Q>to pa&s;s &s;uch laws as they might judge nece&s;&s;ary for giving the ordinance incorporating the Bank its full operation.</Q> Penn&s;ylvania has entered fully into the views, the recom|mendations, and the mea&s;ures of Congre&s;s re&s;pecting the Bank. She has declared in the &s;tronge&s;t manner her &s;en&s;e of their <HI>propriety,</HI> their <HI>rea&s;onablene&s;s,</HI> and their <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ity:</HI> She has pa&s;&s;ed laws for giving them their full operation. Will it redound to the credit of the United States to adopt and pur&s;ue a contrary &s;y&s;tem of conduct? The acts and recommendations of Congre&s;s &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;till in all their original force: Will it not have a tendency to &s;hake all confidence in the councils and proceedings of the United States, if tho&s;e acts and recommendations are now di&s;regarded, without any rea&s;on &s;hewn for di&s;|regarding them? What influence will &s;uch a proceeding have upon the opinions and &s;entiments of the citizens of the United States and of foreigners? In one year they &s;ee mea&s;ures re&s;pecting an object of confe&s;&s;ed public im|portance adopted and recommended with ardour by Con|gre&s;s; and the views and wi&s;hes of that body zealou&s;ly pur&s;ued by Penn&s;ylvania: In another year they &s;ee tho&s;e very mea&s;ures, without any apparent rea&s;on for the change, warmly reprobated by that &s;tate: They mu&s;t con|clude one of two things:&mdash;That Congre&s;s adopted and recommended tho&s;e mea&s;ures ha&s;tily and without con&s;i|deration; or that Penn&s;ylvania has reprobated them un|dutifully and di&s;re&s;pectfully. The former conclu&s;ion will give ri&s;e to very unfavourable reflections concerning the
<PB N="19" REF="019388_0018_0FAB481E19D841B8">
di&s;cernment both of the &s;tate and of the United States: The latter will &s;ugge&s;t very inau&s;picious &s;entiments con|cerning the foederal di&s;po&s;ition and character of this com|monwealth.

<P>5th. IT would not be wi&s;e or politic in the legi&s;lature to repeal her charter to the Bank; becau&s;e the tendency of &s;uch a &s;tep would be to deprive this &s;tate and the United States of all the advantages, public and private, which would flow from the in&s;titution, in times of war, and in times of peace.</P>
<P>LET us turn our attention to &s;ome of the mo&s;t material advantages re&s;ulting from a Bank.</P>
<P>1&s;t. IT increa&s;es circulation, and invigorates indu&s;try. "It is not, &s;ays Dr. Smith, in his Treati&s;e on the Wealth of Nations,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 1, <HI>p.</HI> 383, 384.</NOTE> by augmenting the capital of the country, but by rendering a greater part of that capital active and productive than would otherwi&s;e be &s;o, that the mo&s;t judicious operations of banking can increa&s;e the indu&s;try of the country. The part of his capital which a dealer is obliged to keep by him unemployed, and in ready money, for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands, is &s;o much dead &s;tock, which, &s;o long as it remains in this &s;ituation, produces nothing either to him or to his country. The judicious operations of banking enable him to convert this dead &s;tock into active and productive &s;tock; into materials to work upon, into tools to work with, and into provi&s;ions and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to work for; into &s;tock which produces &s;omething both to him&s;elf and to his country. The gold and &s;ilver money which circu|lates in any country, and by means of which the produce of its land and labour is annually circulated and di&s;tri|buted to the proper con&s;umers, is, in the &s;ame manner
<PB N="20" REF="019388_0019_0FAB481E2C6B0860">
as the ready money of the dealer, all dead &s;tock. It is a very valuable part of the capital of the country, which produces nothing to the country. The judicious opera|tions of banking, by &s;ub&s;tituting paper in the room of a great part of this gold and &s;ilver, enables the country to convert a great part of this dead &s;tock into active and productive &s;tock; into &s;tock which produces &s;omething to the country. The gold and &s;ilver money which cir|culates in any country may very properly be compared to a highway, which, while it circulates and carries to market all the gra&s;s and corn of the country, produces, it&s;elf, not a &s;ingle pile of either. The judicious opera|tions of banking, by providing, if I may be allowed &s;o violent a metaphor, a &s;ort of waggon-way through the air, enable the country to convert, as it were, a great part of its highways into good pa&s;ture and corn-fields, and thereby to increa&s;e very con&s;iderably the annual pro|duce of its land and labour."</P>
<P>THE &s;ame &s;en&s;ible writer informs us, in another place, that "the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 1, <HI>p.</HI> 434, 435.</NOTE> &s;ub&s;titution of paper in the room of gold and &s;ilver money, replaces a very expen&s;ive in&s;trument of commerce with one much le&s;s co&s;tly, and &s;ometimes equally convenient. Circulation comes to be carried on by a new wheel, which it co&s;ts le&s;s both to erect and to maintain than the old one.&mdash;There are &s;everal &s;orts of paper money; but the circulating notes of banks and bankers is the &s;pecies which is be&s;t known, and which &s;eems be&s;t adapted for this purpo&s;e."&mdash;<HI>"The&s;e notes come to have the &s;ame currency as gold and &s;ilver money,</HI> FROM THE CONFIDENCE THAT SUCH MONEY CAN AT ANY TIME BE HAD FOR THEM."</P>
<P>SIR James Stewart calls banking "the great engine,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 2, <HI>p.</HI> 350.</NOTE> by which dome&s;tic circulation is carried on."</P>
<P>TO HAVE a free, ea&s;y and equable in&s;trument of cir|culation is of much importance in all countries: It is of <HI>peculiar</HI> importance in young and flouri&s;hing countries, in which the demands for credit, and the rewards of in|du&s;try, are greater than in any other. When we view the
<PB N="21" REF="019388_0020_0FAB481EED0A1720">
extent and &s;ituation of the United States, we &s;hall be &s;atisfied that their inhabitants may, for a long time to come, employ profitably, in the improvement of their lands, a greater &s;tock than they will be able ea&s;ily to procure. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, it will always be of great &s;ervice to them to &s;ave as much as po&s;&s;ible the expence of &s;o co&s;tly an in&s;trument of commerce as gold and &s;ilver, to &s;ub&s;titute in its place one cheaper, and, for many pur|po&s;es, not le&s;s convenient; and to convert the value of the gold and &s;ilver into the labour and the materials ne|ce&s;&s;ary for improving and extending their &s;ettlements and plantations.</P>
<P>"To the Banks of Scotland, &s;ays Sir James Stewart,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 2, <HI>p.</HI> 356.</NOTE> the improvement of that country is entirely owing; and until they are generally e&s;tabli&s;hed in other countries of Europe, where trade and indu&s;try are little known, it will be very difficult to &s;et tho&s;e great engines to work."</P>
<P>2d. THE influence of a Bank on credit is no le&s;s &s;alu|tary than its influence on circulation. This po&s;ition is, indeed, little more than a corollary from the former. CREDIT IS CONFIDENCE; and, before we can place confidence in a payment, we mu&s;t be convinced that he who is to make it will be both able and willing to do &s;o at the time &s;tipulated. However unexceptionable his character and fortune may be, this conviction can never take place, unle&s;s in a country where &s;olid property can be, at any time, turned into a circulating medium.</P>
<P>3d. TRADE, as well as circulation and credit, de|rives great &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from a Bank. Credit and circulation produce punctuality; and punctuality is the &s;oul of commerce. Let us appeal to experience as well as rea&s;on.</P>
<P>DR. SMITH &s;ays,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 1, <HI>p.</HI> 442.</NOTE> he has heard it a&s;&s;erted, that the trade of the city of Gla&s;gow doubled in about fifteen years after the fir&s;t erection of the Banks there; and that the trade of Scotland has more than quadrupled &s;ince the fir&s;t erection of the two public Banks at Edinburgh, of which one was e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1695, and the other in
<PB N="22" REF="019388_0021_0FAB481FB0635440">
1727. Whether the increa&s;e has been in &s;o great a pro|portion, the author pretends not to know. But that the trade of Scotland has increa&s;ed very con&s;iderably during this period, and that the Banks have contributed a good deal to this increa&s;e, cannot, he &s;ays, be doubted.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations, and ob&s;ervations &s;imilar to the&s;e, have induced Sir James Stewart to conclude.&mdash;that "Banking,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 2, <HI>p.</HI> 358.</NOTE> in the age we live, is that branch of credit which be&s;t de&s;erves the attention of a &s;tate&s;man. Upon the right e&s;tabli&s;hment of Banks depends the pro&s;perity of <HI>trade,</HI> and the equable cour&s;e of circulation. By them, SOLID PROPERTY MAY BE MELTED DOWN. By the means of Banks, money may be con&s;tantly kept at a due proportion to alienation. If alienation increa&s;es, more property may be melted down. If it dimini&s;hes, the quantity of money &s;tagnating will be ab&s;orbed by the Bank, and part of the property formerly melted down in the &s;ecurities granted to them will be, as it were, con&s;olidated anew. The&s;e mu&s;t pay, for the country, the balance of their trade with foreign nations: The&s;e keep the mints at work: And it is BY THESE MEANS, PRINCIPALLY, THAT PRIVATE, MERCANTILE, AND PUBLIC CREDIT IS SUPPORTED."</P>

They appear &s;trictly and &s;trongly applicable to my &s;ubject: And being &s;o, &s;hould carry with them the greate&s;t weight and influence: For the &s;entiments, which they contain and inculcate, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as re&s;ult|ing from <HI>general</HI> principles and facts, and not as calcu|lated for any <HI>partial</HI> purpo&s;e in this commonwealth.</P>
<P>BUT, here, it will probably be a&s;ked&mdash;Has your rea|&s;oning been verified by experience in this country? What advantages have re&s;ulted from the Bank to commerce, circulation and credit? Was our trade ever on &s;uch an unde&s;irable footing? Is not the country di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the
<PB N="23" REF="019388_0022_0FAB48206CBEA6A0">
want of a circulating medium? Is not credit almo&s;t to|tally de&s;troyed?</P>
<P>I ANSWER&mdash;There is, unfortunately, too much truth in the repre&s;entation: But if events are properly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, and traced to their cau&s;es, it will be found&mdash;that none of the inconveniences above-mentioned have ari&s;en from the Bank&mdash;that &s;ome of them have proceed|ed, at lea&s;t in part, from the oppo&s;ition which has been given to it&mdash;and that, as to others, its energy has not been &s;ufficient to counteract or controul them.</P>
<P>THE di&s;agreeable &s;tate of our commerce has been the effect of extravagant and injudicious importation. Du|ring the war, our ports were in a great mea&s;ure blocked up. Imported articles were &s;carce and dear; and we felt the di&s;advantages of a &s;tagnation in bu&s;ine&s;s. Extremes frequently introduce one another. When ho&s;tilities cea|&s;ed, the flood-gates of commerce were opened; and an inundation of foreign manufactures overflowed the Unit|ed States: We &s;eemed to have forgot, that to pay was as nece&s;&s;ary in trade as to purcha&s;e; and we ob&s;erved no proportion between our imports, and our produce and other natural means of remittance. What was the con|&s;equence? Tho&s;e who made any payments made them chiefly in &s;pecie; and in that way dimini&s;hed our circu|lation. Others made no remittances at all, and thereby injured our credit. This account of what happened be|tween the European merchants and our importers, cor|re&s;ponds exactly with what happened between our im|porters and the retailers &s;pread over the different parts of the United States. The retailers, if they paid at all, paid in &s;pecie. And thus every operation, foreign and dome&s;tic, had an injurious effect on our credit, our cir|culation, and our commerce. But are any of the&s;e di&s;|advantages to be a&s;cribed to the Bank? No. Is it to be accounted a fault or defect in the Bank, that it did not prevent or remedy tho&s;e di&s;advantages? By no means. Becau&s;e one is not able to &s;tem a torrent, is he therefore to be charged with augmenting its &s;trength? The Bank has had many difficulties to encounter. The experiment
<PB N="24" REF="019388_0023_0FAB48212CE76C20">
was a new one in this country: It was therefore nece&s;|&s;ary that it &s;hould be conducted with caution. While the war continued, the demands of the public were great; and the &s;tock of the Bank was but incon&s;idera|ble: It had its active enemies, and its timid friends. Soon after the peace was concluded, its operations were re&s;trained and embarra&s;&s;ed by an attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h a new Bank. A year had not elap&s;ed after this, when the mea&s;ure, which has occa&s;ioned the&s;e Con&s;iderations, was introduced into the legi&s;lature, and cau&s;ed, for &s;ome time&punc; a total &s;tagnation in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the in&s;titu|tion. When all the&s;e circum&s;tances are recollected and attended to, it will be matter of &s;urprize that the Bank has done &s;o much, and not that it has done no more. Let it be deemed, as it ought to be, the object of public confidence, and not of public jealou&s;y: Let it be encou|raged, in&s;tead of being oppo&s;ed, by the coun&s;els and proceedings of the &s;tate: Then will the genuine effects of the in&s;titution appear; then will they &s;pread their au&s;picious influence over Agriculture, Manufactures and Commerce.</P>
<P>4th. ANOTHER advantage to be expected from the Bank of North-America is, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an un|depreciating paper currency through the United States. This is an object of great con&s;equence, whether it be con&s;idered in a political, or in a commercial view. It will be found to have a happy effect on the collection, the di&s;tribution, and the management of the public re|venue: It will remove the inconveniences and fluctua|tion attending exchange and remittances between the different &s;tates. "It is the intere&s;t of every trading &s;tate to have a &s;ufficient quantity of paper, well &s;ecured, to circulate through it, &s;o as to facilitate payments every where, and to cut off inland exchanges, which are a great clog upon trade, and are attended with the ri&s;que of receiving the paper of people, who&s;e credit is but doubtful."&mdash;<HI>Political Oeconomy, vol.</HI> 2, <HI>p.</HI> 415.</P>
<P>SUCH are the advantages which may be expected to flow from a <HI>National Bank,</HI> in times of peace. In times
<PB N="25" REF="019388_0024_0FAB4821EC29C170">
of war, the in&s;titution may be con&s;idered as <HI>e&s;&s;ential.</HI> We have &s;een that, without it, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Depart|ment of Finance could not have been carried on in the late war. It will be of u&s;e to recollect the &s;ituation of the United States with regard to this &s;ubject. The two or three fir&s;t years of the war were &s;ufficient to convince the Briti&s;h government, and the Briti&s;h armies, that they could not &s;ubdue the United States by military force. Their hopes of &s;ucce&s;s re&s;ted on the failure of our fi|nances. This was the &s;ource of our fears, as well as of the hopes of our enemies. By this thread our fate was &s;u&s;pended. We watched it with anxiety: We &s;aw it &s;tretched and weakened every hour: The deathful in|&s;trument was ready to fall upon our heads: On our heads it mu&s;t have fallen, had not public credit, in the moment when it was about to break a&s;under, been en|twined and &s;upported by the credit of the Bank. Con|gre&s;s, to &s;peak without metaphors, had not money or credit to hire an expre&s;s, or purcha&s;e a cord of wood. General Wa&s;hington, on one occa&s;ion, and probably more than one, &s;aw his army <HI>literally unable to march.</HI> Our di&s;tre&s;s was &s;uch, that it would have been de&s;truc|tion to have divulged it: But it ought to be known <HI>now;</HI> and when known, ought to have its proper influ|ence on the public mind and the public conduct.</P>
<P>THE expences of a war mu&s;t be defrayed, either&mdash;1&s;t, by trea&s;ures previou&s;ly accumulated&mdash;or 2dly, by &s;upplies levied and collected within the year, as they are called for&mdash;or 3dly, by the anticipation of the public revenues. No one will venture to refer us to the fir&s;t mode. To the &s;econd the United States, as well as eve|ry &s;tate in Europe, are rendered incompetent by the mo|dern &s;y&s;tem of war, which, in the military operations of <HI>one</HI> year, concenters the revenue of <HI>many.</HI> While our enemies adhere to this &s;y&s;tem, we mu&s;t adopt it. The anticipation of revenue, then, is the only mode, by which the expences of a future war can be defrayed. How the revenues of the United States can be anticipa|ted without the operations of a National Bank, I leave
<PB N="26" REF="019388_0025_0FAB4822ACB97298">
to tho&s;e who attack the Bank of North-America to &s;hew. They ought to be well prepared to &s;hew it; for they mu&s;t know, that to be incapable of &s;upporting a war is but a &s;ingle &s;tep from being involved in one.</P>
<P>THE re&s;ult of the whole, under this head, is,&mdash;that in times of peace, the National Bank will be <HI>highly advantageous;</HI> that in times of war, it will be <HI>e&s;&s;en|tially nece&s;&s;ary,</HI>&mdash;to the United States.</P>
<P>I FLATTER my&s;elf, that I have evinced the <HI>validity</HI> and the <HI>utility</HI> of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>IT HAS been &s;urmi&s;ed, that the de&s;ign of the legi&s;la|ture is not to de&s;troy, but to modify, the charter of the Bank; and that if the Directors would a&s;&s;ent to rea&s;on|able amendments, the charter, modified, might conti|nue in force. If this is the ca&s;e, &s;urely to repeal the law incorporating the Bank is not the proper mode of doing the bu&s;ine&s;s. The Bank was e&s;tabli&s;hed and or|gani&s;ed under the authority and au&s;pices of Congre&s;s. The Directors have a tru&s;t and duty to di&s;charge to the United States, and to all the particular States, each of which has an equal intere&s;t in the Bank. They could not have received, from this &s;tate, a charter, unle&s;s it had been <HI>&s;imilar</HI> to that granted by Congre&s;s. Without the approbation of Congre&s;s, where all the &s;tates are re|pre&s;ented, the Directors would not be ju&s;tified in agree|ing to any alteration of the in&s;titution. If alterations are nece&s;&s;ary; they &s;hould be made through the channel of the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honor to tran&s;mit herewith an Ordi|nance, pa&s;&s;ed by the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;|&s;embled the 31&s;t day of December, 1781, incorporating the &s;ub&s;cribers to the Bank of North-America, together with &s;undry re&s;olutions, recommending to the &s;everal &s;tates to pa&s;s &s;uch laws as they may judge nece&s;&s;ary for giving the &s;aid Ordinance its full operation. The re&s;o|lutions of the 26th of May la&s;t &s;peak &s;o clearly to the points nece&s;&s;ary to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by tho&s;e laws, that I need not enlarge on them. Should any thing more be found nece&s;&s;ary upon experience, the Pre&s;ident and Di|rectors will no doubt make &s;uitable applications to Con|gre&s;s, or to the &s;tates re&s;pectively, as the ca&s;e may require. It affords me great &s;atisfaction to inform your Excellency, that this Bank commenced its operations ye&s;terday; and I am confident, that with proper ma|nagement it will an&s;wer the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of tho&s;e who befriend the in&s;titution. It will facilitate the management of the finances of the United States: The &s;everal States may, when their re&s;pective nece&s;&s;ities re|quire, and the abilities of the Bank will permit, derive
<PB N="30" REF="019388_0029_0FAB4825F1DDEE20">
occa&s;ional advantage and accommodations from it: It will afford to the individuals of all the &s;tates, a medium for their intercour&s;e with each other, and for the pay|ment of taxes, more convenient than the precious me|tals, and equally &s;afe: It will have a tendency to increa&s;e both the internal and external commerce of North-Ame|rica, and undoubtedly will be infinitely u&s;eful to all the traders of every &s;tate in the union: Provided, as I have already &s;aid, it is conducted on the principles of equity, ju&s;tice, prudence and oeconomy. The pre&s;ent Directors bear characters that cannot fail to in&s;pire confidence; and as the corporation is amenable to the laws, power can neither &s;anctify any improper conduct, nor protect the guilty. Under a full conviction of the&s;e things, I flatter my&s;elf that I &s;hall &s;tand excu&s;ed for recommend|ing, in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, this well meant plan, to all the encouragement and protection which your &s;tate can give, con&s;i&s;tently with wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice.
