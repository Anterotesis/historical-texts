<P>THEY are the words of holy <HI>David.</HI> The occa&s;ion of his penning them is not certain: But 'tis probable, 'twas now a <HI>dying time</HI> among the <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>Faithful;</HI> or a <HI>time of growing degeneracy</HI> among all &s;orts and orders of men: upon either of which accounts, 'twas a <HI>proper Sea&s;on</HI> to cry to almighty God for <HI>help.</HI> And this the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> accordingly does in the language of my text, <HI>Help Lord! for the Godly man cea&s;eth; for the Faithful fail from among the children of Men:</HI> In &s;peaking to which words, I &s;hall,

I. I am, in the <HI>fir&s;t place,</HI> to open to you the character of the <HI>Godly man</HI> and the <HI>Faithful man,</HI> the per&s;ons mention'd in the text.</P>
<P N="1">1. And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall &s;peak of the <HI>Godly man;</HI> the <HI>foundation-&s;troke</HI> in who&s;e character is, his <HI>faith in God</HI> as a being infinitely great and glorious; the creator and governour of the World, the &s;aviour and rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him: according to that of the <HI>apo&s;tle,</HI> Heb. 11. 6. <HI>Without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e</HI> God: <HI>For he that cometh to God mu&s;t believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is his faith, in the being and attributes and do|minion of God, a <HI>meer &s;peculative notion;</HI> but an <HI>active living principle,</HI> &s;uitably exciting and moving the &s;eve|ral <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>affections</HI> of his mind.</P>
<P>He &s;o believes the <HI>maje&s;ty</HI> and <HI>power</HI> of God, as to be fill'd with an habitual <HI>awe</HI> and <HI>reverence</HI> of him; dread|ing his di&s;plea&s;ure, being much more afraid to offend him than any <HI>other Being</HI> what&s;oever; in conformity to that caution of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> Luk. 12. 4, 5. <HI>Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you, whom ye &s;hall fear: Fear him, which, after he hath killed, hath power to ca&s;t into hell; yea, I &s;ay unto you, fear him.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;o believes the <HI>faithfulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>veracity</HI> of God, as to rely on <HI>his word,</HI> confide in the <HI>truth</HI> and depend on the <HI>fulfilment of his promi&s;es:</HI> And however little appearance, humanely &s;peaking, there may be at pre|&s;ent, of their accompli&s;hment, <HI>he &s;taggers not at the promi&s;e of God through unbelief; but is &s;trong in faith, giving glory to God: being per&s;uaded, that what he hath promi&s;ed, he is able al&s;o to perform.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;o believes in God as a being infinitely <HI>amiable, beautiful</HI> and <HI>de&s;irable,</HI> as to <HI>love him with all his heart, and &s;oul, and mind, and &s;trength;</HI> e&s;teeming his <HI>favor as life,</HI> and his <HI>loving-kindne&s;s better than life.</HI> None <HI>in

heaven,</HI> in his account, is <HI>like unto God,</HI> nor does he <HI>de&s;ire any on earth be&s;ides him:</HI> And his chief concern is, that God would be his friend, his God and <HI>portion forever.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;o believes the <HI>paternal care, kindne&s;s</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> of God, as to place his intire <HI>hope</HI> and <HI>confidence</HI> in him; <HI>tru&s;ting in the Lord at all times:</HI> E&s;pecially, making God <HI>his refuge</HI> in the <HI>day of his di&s;tre&s;s;</HI> relying on him for all that help and &s;alvation, which is <HI>in vain to be looked for from the hills, and the multitude of mountains,</HI> and is to be had only in God, the <HI>&s;aviour of his people in the time of trouble.</HI> Yea, he is &s;o firmly per&s;uaded of the <HI>love</HI> and <HI>pity</HI> of God towards <HI>them that fear him,</HI> that he <HI>ca&s;ts his whole care upon him; taking no thought,</HI> no inordinate thought, <HI>for his life, what he &s;hall eat, or what he &s;hall drink, or wherewithal he &s;hall be cloathed:</HI> as knowing, that God <HI>feedeth the fowls of the air, and cloatheth the lilies of the field,</HI> and <HI>will much more feed and cloath</HI> his own children, who are <HI>much better than they.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;o believes the <HI>&s;upreme authority,</HI> and <HI>&s;overeign univer&s;al dominion of God,</HI> as to <HI>acquie&s;ce</HI> in all his deal|ings; not daring to di&s;pute his plea&s;ure, or re&s;i&s;t his will, or find fault with or murmur again&s;t his providen|tial di&s;pen&s;ations. That's the habitual inward &s;en&s;e and temper of his mind, <HI>It is the Lord, let him do what &s;eemeth him good.</HI> He is willing, at the call of God, to part with any thing, his reputation, his intere&s;t, his friends; yea, he <HI>counts not his life dear</HI> &s;o he may but honour God, and <HI>fini&s;h his cour&s;e with joy.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, he &s;o believes in God as <HI>&s;ending his only be|gotten &s;on</HI> into the world, <HI>not to condemn the world, but that the world thro' him might be &s;aved,</HI> that he hopes for &s;alvation in <HI>none</HI> but <HI>in Chri&s;t:</HI> and <HI>thro' him,</HI> and the <HI>merits of his mediatorial undertaking</HI> for &s;inners, he tru&s;ts in the mercy of God to eternal life.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004129_0006_1003D17F05667240">
But this is not all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Godly man's faith in God</HI> has a powerful influ|ence on his <HI>life</HI> as well as <HI>heart.</HI> It not only excites an <HI>internal regard</HI> towards God in the <HI>affections of his mind,</HI> but a due care to expre&s;s this regard in all proper acts of outward <HI>reverence</HI> and <HI>obedience.</HI></P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;ed God is the <HI>con&s;tant object</HI> of his <HI>external homage and wor&s;hip.</HI> He is a man of prayer; delights in the duty, and is frequent in the practice of it. He is one that <HI>prays without cea&s;ing;</HI> is habitually in a <HI>praying frame,</HI> and improves every proper &s;ea&s;on of <HI>making known his reque&s;ts to God by prayer, with &s;uppli|cation and thank&s;giving.</HI> He daily retires from the world, and <HI>enters into his clo&s;et,</HI> and <HI>prays to his father who is in &s;ecret,</HI> and hears in &s;ecret in order to his <HI>re|warding openly.</HI> And as becomes a man of Godline&s;s, he <HI>every day</HI> takes care, that the <HI>morning and evening &s;acrifice</HI> a&s;cends up to God from his <HI>family,</HI> as the <HI>per|petual burnt-offering:</HI> Nor is he content with the&s;e more <HI>private</HI> duties of devotion: but is con&s;tant at the <HI>hou&s;e of God,</HI> &s;erious and reverent in his attendance on the exerci&s;es of <HI>publick wor&s;hip,</HI> both <HI>in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>And very particular is the regard which he pays to the <HI>Lord's &s;abbath.</HI> 'Tis his great concern and care to &s;anctifie this <HI>day of God;</HI> not allowing him&s;elf to <HI>do his own ways, or find his own plea&s;ure, or &s;peak his own words.</HI> He religiou&s;ly &s;eperates him&s;elf from the world, re&s;ts from all its labours and employments, and &s;pends the time in the &s;ervice of God, and to the purpo&s;es of piety and devotion.</P>
<P>And he pays a great regard to the <HI>word</HI> as well as <HI>&s;abbath</HI> of God; con&s;ulting it upon all occa&s;ions, as the <HI>man of his coun&s;el,</HI> his main guide in the way of duty. The <HI>&s;cripture</HI> he receives as <HI>given by in&s;piration of God:</HI> And becau&s;e 'tis <HI>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> he repairs to it as a &s;uitable
<PB N="5" REF="004129_0007_1003D1930E37B1B8">
means in order to his becoming <HI>perfect</HI> as a <HI>man of God,</HI> and <HI>throughly furni&s;hed unto all good works.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, the <HI>Godly man</HI> is one that expre&s;&s;es a due regard to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>every thing that bears relation to him,</HI> thro' the general tenour of his actions. He is one in|tirely devoted to God; and 'tis his de&s;ire and care, that his whole external conduct may expre&s;s the highe&s;t ve|neration of him. He would not willingly do any thing offen&s;ive to God, but every thing plea&s;ing in his &s;ight. He aims at the glory of God; and what gives the fini&s;hing &s;troke in his character, con&s;tantly endea|vours to be as <HI>like him</HI> as po&s;&s;ible. He continually &s;ets God before him as his <HI>pattern and exemplar,</HI> and is <HI>an imitator of him as a dear child.</HI> He has no higher ambition than to <HI>re&s;emble God,</HI> and 'tis his daily care to appear in the world, in &s;ome proportion, a <HI>living image of him;</HI> being <HI>holy as he is holy, and perfect as his father in heaven is perfect.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. But I mu&s;t now go on in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, to &s;peak of the <HI>Faithful man.</HI> The text makes mention not only of the <HI>Godly man,</HI> but the <HI>Faithful man.</HI> And the <HI>character</HI> is capable of being under&s;tood in a <HI>variety</HI> of &s;en&s;es, according to the <HI>various u&s;e</HI> of the word <HI>Faithful&punc;</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes, it relates to our <HI>words,</HI> and means the &s;ame thing with <HI>&s;peaking the truth.</HI> Hence that of Prov. 14. 5. <HI>A faithful witne&s;s will not lie.</HI> And in this &s;en&s;e of the word, the <HI>faithful man</HI> is a man of <HI>truth and veracity;</HI> one who makes con&s;cience of his <HI>words</HI> as well as <HI>actions.</HI> Lying and deceit are <HI>abomination</HI> to him, as they are to the <HI>holy God.</HI> He knows not how to utter a fal&s;hood, nor dare he do it, nor will he ever knowingly break in upon the law of truth. He is one who&s;e word may be rely'd on. There is an agree|ment between his <HI>heart</HI> and <HI>tongue.</HI> He believes what he &s;ays, and when ever he &s;peaks, 'tis under the <HI>habitual
<PB N="6" REF="004129_0008_1003D1A20F599C78">
influence</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>apo&s;tolic</HI> injunctions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col. 3. 9.</NOTE>, <HI>Lie not one to another, &s;eeing ye have put off the old man with his deeds.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 4. 25.</NOTE> <HI>Wherefore putting away lying, &s;peak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of ano|ther.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes again, the word <HI>faithful</HI> relates to our <HI>promi&s;es,</HI> and intends <HI>faithfulne&s;s in performing them.</HI> Thus 'tis u&s;ed, 1 The&s;. 5. 24. <HI>Faithful is he who calleth you, who al&s;o will do it.</HI> And in this &s;en&s;e, the <HI>faithful man</HI> is one who will <HI>&s;tand to his word,</HI> be punctual in a compliance with his engagements. He is not one of tho&s;e who make promi&s;es to &s;erve a <HI>pre&s;ent turn,</HI> with|out any intention to perform them: But when ever he pa&s;&s;es his word, he <HI>&s;peaks the truth in his heart,</HI> hone&s;tly de&s;igns to do what he &s;ays; looking upon his word as &s;acred, and him&s;elf as &s;olemnly bound by it: Nor will he fail if po&s;&s;ible, of an exact compliance with it. Yea, &s;o punctual is he to his word, &s;o exact to his engage|ments, that he'll be faithful to comply, tho' it be to his real damage. As the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> has drawn his charac|ter<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 15. 4.</NOTE>, <HI>tho' he &s;weareth to his own hurt, he changeth not.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes again, the word <HI>faithful</HI> relates to a <HI>tru&s;t committed to us,</HI> and means the &s;ame thing with <HI>fidelity in the di&s;charge of it.</HI> And this is the mo&s;t <HI>proper</HI> as well as <HI>common</HI> &s;en&s;e, in which it is u&s;ed in <HI>&s;cripture.</HI> In this &s;en&s;e of the <HI>word,</HI> we read of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in that lan|guage, Numb. 12. 7. <HI>My &s;ervant Mo&s;es,&mdash;who is faithful in all my hou&s;e.</HI> So of <HI>David,</HI> 1 Sam. 22. 14. <HI>Who is &s;o faithful among all thy &s;ervants as David.</HI> So of <HI>Daniel,</HI> Dan. 6. 4. <HI>Fora&s;much as he was faithful; neither was there any error or fault found in him.</HI> And in this &s;en&s;e of the <HI>word,</HI> the <HI>faithful man</HI> is one who u&s;es <HI>fidelity in the tru&s;t repo&s;ed to him.</HI> Whatever the betru&s;tment be that is committed to him, whether it relates to the <HI>&s;ouls</HI> or <HI>bodies</HI> of men, their <HI>temporal</HI> or
<PB N="7" REF="004129_0009_1003D1A738D22098">
<HI>&s;piritual</HI> concerns, he'll endeavour to be an&s;werable to it, by a con&s;ciencious care to di&s;charge the duties ex|pected and required of him. He won't betray his tru&s;t, nor &s;hrink from under the burdens of it; neither will he let it &s;uffer thro' neglect, or a carle&s;s, &s;lothful, in|active management of it: but will be tho'row and effectual in doing the duties belonging to it. He looks upon his tru&s;t as committed to him by God. He reali&s;es the eye of God upon him; and upon the prin|ciples of religion, a regard to God and the good of men, behaves with care and prudence, and diligence. He expects to be called to an account at the great day of reckoning, how he has manag'd his tru&s;t, and therefore applies him&s;elf to the proper duties of it, with the greate&s;t care; being active and laborious in doing what he has been call'd to in the providence of God: And he is &s;olicitous to do what he does in the <HI>be&s;t manner,</HI> &s;o as &s;hall <HI>be&s;t</HI> an&s;wer the end of his betru&s;tment, and &s;o as that he may finally come off with the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience, the approbation of men; and what is of infinitely more worth, the approbation of his <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Judge,</HI> &s;aying unto him, in the great day of his appearing, <HI>Well done, thou good and faithful &s;er|vant; thou ha&s;t been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, the word <HI>faithful</HI> is &s;ometimes taken in a large and extended &s;en&s;e, &s;o as to mean the &s;ame thing with <HI>fidelity in the whole work of religion.</HI> Thus 'tis u&s;ed, Rev. 2. 10. <HI>Be thou faithful to death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</HI> And this is one thing, perhaps the chief thing intended, when we read, in the <HI>epi&s;tles</HI> of <HI>Paul,</HI> of this and the other fellow Chri&s;|tian, in that &s;tile, <HI>a faithful &s;ervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And in this &s;en&s;e of the word, the <HI>faithful man</HI> is one, who employs him&s;elf with <HI>fidelity in the great bu&s;ine&s;s of religion.</HI> He does not content him&s;elf with vain
<PB N="8" REF="004129_0010_1003D1B05B6E7218">
wi&s;hes and faint ineffectual endeavours; but is active and &s;tirring in the <HI>work of God</HI> and <HI>his &s;oul's &s;alvation.</HI> His concern is, to fill up his time with work and labour; <HI>doing with his might what&s;oever his hand findeth to do:</HI> con&s;idering there is <HI>no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wi&s;dom in the grave, whither he goeth.</HI> He con&s;iders the <HI>&s;everal relations</HI> he &s;u&s;tains in the world, and is &s;ollicitous to do <HI>the duties of them.</HI> He con&s;iders the <HI>various talents</HI> committed to him by his great Lord, and u&s;es his <HI>be&s;t &s;kill</HI> to improve them to the <HI>be&s;t advantage.</HI> He con&s;iders the particular <HI>&s;tate and condition of life</HI> it has plea&s;ed God to place him in, and is careful to behave in it to the <HI>honour of God</HI> and his <HI>own final good account.</HI> In a word, his great aim is, <HI>to &s;erve God and his generation according to the will of God;</HI> and this is the chief care, the main endeavour of his life.</P>
<P>And thus you have &s;een the variety of &s;en&s;es, in which a man may be characteris'd as a <HI>faithful man.</HI> The <HI>particular &s;en&s;e,</HI> in which the <HI>de&s;cription</HI> is to be under&s;tood in the <HI>text,</HI> is not certain: nor is it material. For in <HI>either &s;en&s;e,</HI> the <HI>character</HI> is <HI>beautiful</HI> and <HI>lovely;</HI> and affords ju&s;t ground for lamentation, when per&s;ons &s;o excellent and de&s;irable <HI>cea&s;e from among men.</HI> And this brings me,</P>
<P>II. In the <HI>&s;econd place,</HI> to explain the &s;en&s;e, in which the <HI>Godly and faithful</HI> are &s;aid, in the <HI>text,</HI> to <HI>cea&s;e and fail from among the children of men.</HI> And there are two &s;en&s;es, in which the words may be explain'd.</P>
<P N="1">1. They may be under&s;tood of <HI>the death</HI> of the faith|ful and Godly. And the death of this kind of per&s;ons is a common ca&s;e. The <HI>Godly</HI> are equally expos'd to death with the <HI>ungodly,</HI> and will as &s;urely fall by the &s;troke of it, &s;ooner or later. There is <HI>no di&s;charge in this war</HI> for <HI>&s;aints</HI> any more than <HI>&s;inners. Holine&s;s</HI> it &s;elf will not &s;ecure from the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> however it will de|liver
<PB N="9" REF="004129_0011_1003D1B958DFC858">
from the <HI>&s;econd death.</HI> Says the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> Heb. 9. 27. <HI>It's appointed for all men once to die.</HI> Agre|able whereto is that of the in&s;pir'd <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> P&s;alm 89. 48. <HI>What man is he that liveth, and &s;hall not &s;ee death?</HI> The &s;en&s;e is, there is no man, let him be who he will, or his moral character what it will, but he &s;hall <HI>as &s;urely die as he is now alive.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Godly</HI> have always been &s;ubjected to death in common with others.

<P>If the <HI>Godly and faithful cea&s;e by means of death,</HI> he can rai&s;e up and qualify others to &s;tand in their place and make their ground good.

<HI>crown of glory</HI> to this a&s;&s;embly, are now laid in the dark and &s;ilent grave: and <HI>&s;mall is the remnant that is left.</HI> Like the <HI>gleaning of the vintage,</HI> they are thinly &s;cat|ter'd, but here and there one to be &s;een in the <HI>place of wor&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis worth our remark, the <HI>continuance of old men,</HI> the protracting their days, is particularly mention'd as one of the <HI>&s;ignal ble&s;&s;ings</HI> of that <HI>happy time,</HI> which, ac|cording to the <HI>promi&s;e of God,</HI> we are looking and hoping, and praying for. To this purpo&s;e we read, I&s;a. 65. 19, 20. <HI>And I will rejoice in Jeru&s;alem, and joy in my people:&mdash;There &s;hall be no more thence an old man that hath not fill'd his days.</HI> And on the other hand, the <HI>cea&s;ing of old men</HI> is made, in <HI>&s;cripture,</HI> a very &s;evere token of the Divine di&s;plea&s;ure: according to that <HI>threatning of God</HI> again&s;t the <HI>hou&s;e of Eli,</HI> 1 Sam. 2. 31. <HI>Behold the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy Father's hou&s;e, that there &s;hall not be an old man in thine hou&s;e:</HI> Agreable whereto is that <HI>&s;orrowful exclamation,</HI> I&s;a. 3. 1, 2. <HI>For behold, the Lord, the Lord of ho&s;ts, doth take away from Jeru&s;alem, and from Judah,&mdash;the prudent and the ancient.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>general failing of aged &s;aints</HI> &s;hould therefore be e&s;teem'd a <HI>&s;orrowful humbling article,</HI> in the cour&s;e of Divine providence. And as there has vi&s;ibly been a <HI>very great cea&s;ing</HI> of the <HI>aged di&s;ciples</HI> of this Church, we &s;hould, as 'tis our duty, religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve and re|&s;ent the hand of God herein.</P>
<P>But what I would more e&s;pecially call upon you to lament is, the <HI>cea&s;ing</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> men, the manner of who&s;e <HI>holy life</HI> and <HI>happy death</HI> is yet fre&s;h in our remembrance.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t whom it plea&s;ed God to remove from us, was taken out of the <HI>Seat of Deacons</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Zachariah Thayer,</HI> who died <HI>Feb.</HI> 7. 17<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE>; a man of faith and prayer: full of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and admiring adoring tho'ts

<P>We were then called in the holy and righteous pro|vidence of God, to re&s;ign up one of tho&s;e <HI>good men</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Jonathan Jack&s;on,</HI> who died <HI>May</HI> 4. 1736.</NOTE>, <HI>for whom,</HI> as the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> &s;peaks, <HI>one would even dare to die; a devout man, and one that feared the Lord with all his hou&s;e, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway;</HI> a man univer&s;ally beloved and well &s;po|ken of, for his meek and quiet &s;pirit; his humble, peaceable and inoffen&s;ive carriage; his large and &s;ea|&s;onable charities, which were ever going up <HI>for a memo|rial before God;</HI> and in a word, his &s;trong and &s;teady faith in God and Chri&s;t, and things un&s;een and eternal: di&s;covering it &s;elf in a holy contempt of the world, with all its pomps and vanities; an uninterrupted wil|lingne&s;s; yea, con&s;tant de&s;ire, in the mid&s;t of riches and plenty, to depart hence to <HI>be with Chri&s;t,</HI> which he e&s;teemed <HI>far better</HI> than to abide here.</P>

upright heart, and a blamele&s;s and exemplary con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>And more lately &s;till, we have been call'd to mourn the death of one, who, tho' not related to us the&s;e few la&s;t years, was yet formerly, and for a long cour&s;e of time, your <HI>faithful laborious Pa&s;tor</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Benjamin Wad&s;worth,</HI> the Reverend <HI>Pre&s;ident of Harvard College,</HI> who died March 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. 17<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">7.</NOTE>: than whom, per|haps, few were more con&s;tant and diligent in employing their time and talents in the &s;ervice, and to the honour of God: And not many have been more in&s;trumental of &s;piritual and eternal good to the &s;ouls of men. I doubt not, he has a te&s;timony in the hearts of many of you, to his care of your &s;ouls, his con&s;ciencious ar|duous endeavours to bring you to God, in the way of true and undefiled religion. You are all witne&s;&s;es of his holy and heavenly walk among you; of his being to you <HI>an example, in word, in conver&s;ation, in charity, in &s;pirit, in faith, in purity.</HI>&mdash;But his excellent cha|racter having been already laid open to you, by a better and more proper hand, I &s;hall only add that <HI>exhortation</HI> of the <HI>apo&s;tle,</HI> adapting it to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, Heb. 13. 7. <HI>Remember him, who had the rule over you, who &s;poke unto you the word of God: who&s;e faith follow, con&s;idering the end of his conver&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P>It remains now to take &s;ome proper notice of the more &s;pecial occa&s;ion of my bringing you &s;uch a di&s;|cour&s;e at this time; the death of that <HI>valuable</HI> per&s;on, it plea&s;ed the holy God to take from us the la&s;t week.</P>
<P>I could not refrain from dropping a tear over his grave: Nor can I &s;uppo&s;e, that any that knew him will except again&s;t a publick recommending an exam|ple, in many re&s;pects, &s;o worthy of imitation.</P>
<P>The per&s;on, who&s;e decea&s;e we are lamenting, was an in&s;tance of <HI>early piety.</HI> He <HI>betimes</HI> enter'd upon a religious cour&s;e, and had made good progre&s;s in the way of God's commandments. He was a chearful,
<PB N="22" REF="004129_0024_1003D2144DD3E2F0">
active, good Chri&s;tian; a hearty lover of God and all good men; e&s;pecially the Godly faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, whom he highly e&s;teemed for their work's &s;ake, often &s;hewing them the kindne&s;s of the Lord. He was a man of prayer; con&s;tant at the hou&s;e and wor&s;hip of God; true to his word; punctual to his engagements; &s;incere in his profe&s;&s;ions; charitable in his deeds, being always ready to every good work; an upright, &s;ober, hone&s;t, faithful man; one that <HI>feared God above many,</HI> and <HI>walk'd in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamele&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>As a <HI>Deacon,</HI> he was <HI>grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; holding the my&s;tery of the faith in a pure con&s;cience:</HI> And he <HI>u&s;ed his office, being found blamele&s;s.</HI> He was indeed excellently turn'd and &s;pirited to it; and by his active, con&s;tant, prudent and faithful attendance on the duties of it, was a &s;ignal ble&s;&s;ing in his place, and known and acknowledg'd to be &s;o.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid of him, with truth and ju&s;tice, he was generally beloved while <HI>living,</HI> and as generally lamen|ted now he is <HI>dead.</HI> And in <HI>his death,</HI> the <HI>Town</HI> have lo&s;t a man <HI>u&s;eful in his generation;</HI> the <HI>Church,</HI> a <HI>faithful officer</HI> as well as <HI>generous benefactor;</HI> and the <HI>poor,</HI> an <HI>open-banded</HI> and <HI>compa&s;&s;ionate friend.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, as he was one who <HI>lived to Chri&s;t,</HI> we have rea&s;on to hope he <HI>died in him:</HI> And of &s;uch the apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> &s;peaks in that remarkable language, Rev. 14. 13. <HI>I heard a voice from heaven, &s;aying to me, write, ble&s;&s;ed are the dead which are in the Lord, from henceforth: Yea, &s;aith the &s;pirit, that they may re&s;t from their labours; and their works do follow them.</HI></P>
<P>A thought comforting and refre&s;hing! and &s;hould be as a &s;pring of joy to the <HI>mourning children,</HI> who &s;hould temper their &s;orrow with the <HI>good hope</HI> they have, that 'tis now well with their <HI>departed father</HI> in the <HI>paradi&s;e of God.</HI> Be thankful <HI>you mourn not as
<PB N="23" REF="004129_0025_1003D21851E321D0">
tho&s;e who have no hope: For if Chri&s;t died and ro&s;e again, even &s;o them al&s;o which &s;leep in Je&s;us, will God bring with him.</HI> Wherefore <HI>comfort</HI> your &s;elves and <HI>one another with the&s;e words.</HI> And beware of witholding from God the glory of his &s;overeign dominion. <HI>Be dumb with &s;ilence,</HI> and <HI>open not your mouths,</HI> unle&s;s it be to acknowledge and adore the &s;overeignty, and holi|ne&s;s, and wi&s;dom, and righteou&s;ne&s;s of this di&s;pen&s;ation; and to &s;upplicate at the throne of God all that &s;upport and comfort you need. And let it be your care to make a wi&s;e and holy u&s;e of this providence. Learn herefrom the uncertainty of all earthly enjoyments; and more than ever tru&s;t in God, and make him your hope and happine&s;s. Chu&s;e your <HI>father's God</HI> for <HI>your God;</HI> and <HI>know him and &s;erve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind:</HI> So will he be your friend and father; your guide thro' the world; your guide thro' death, and <HI>your portion for ever.</HI></P>
<P>And now, my <HI>brethren,</HI> the cea&s;ing of &s;uch <HI>godly</HI> and <HI>faithful men by death,</HI> is a frown of providence, and a &s;ore breach upon us. Let us not be in&s;en&s;ible of our <HI>great lo&s;s</HI> in the <HI>many deaths,</HI> there have been, of late, among us. Our glory is hereby thinned, our &s;trength impaired, and we are gradually becoming weak and feeble. Let us lift up a cry to almighty God with holy <HI>David, Help Lord! for the Godly man cea&s;eth; for the Faithful fail from among the children of men.</HI> And let there be no rea&s;on for that com|plaint, <HI>the righteous peri&s;heth, and no man layeth it to heart.</HI> Let us duly re&s;ent the removal of our <HI>pious brethren in Chri&s;t,</HI> and be concerned to &s;ee their places fill'd. And let us be con&s;tant and fervent in our ap|plications to God, to <HI>be the repairer of our breaches;</HI> to make <HI>daily additions</HI> to us, of tho&s;e who &s;hall be men of like piety and integrity, with tho&s;e who are gone off the &s;tage.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="004129_0026_1003D21D95B9B4E0">
I &s;hall only add, have we not rea&s;on to fear, whether there han't been a <HI>far more awful cea&s;ing</HI> of the Godly and faithful from among us, through the <HI>growing wick|edne&s;s of the pre&s;ent day,</HI> than by means of <HI>death?</HI> O let us lament our grievous <HI>departures from the living God!</HI> He, <HI>which &s;earcheth the reins and hearts,</HI> might ju&s;tly be&s;peak us, as he once did the <HI>Church of Ephe&s;us, I have &s;omewhat again&s;t thee, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t left thy fir&s;t love</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. 2. 4.</NOTE>.

<P>And may it plea&s;e the good and gracious God, as <HI>Godly faithful</HI> men are cau&s;ed to <HI>cea&s;e from among us by death,</HI> to rai&s;e up others, from time to time, to &s;upply their place!
