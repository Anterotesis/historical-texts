<HEAD>THE GROUND AND NATURE OF Chri&s;tian Redemption.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fall of man into the life and &s;tate of This World, is the Whole Ground of his Redemption; and a Real Birth of CHRIST in the &s;oul, is the Whole Nature of it. To con|vince man of his Fall as the Ground of his Redemption, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to appeal to the hi&s;tory which Mo&s;es has given of it; becau&s;e Mo&s;es's hi&s;tory of the Fall is not the proof of it, and becau&s;e a meer hi&s;torical knowledge of the Fall would not do man any real good. Mo&s;es has recorded the death of the fir&s;t man, and of many of his de&s;cendents; but the proof that man is Mortal, lies not in Mo&s;es's hi&s;tory, but in the known nature of man, and the world from which he has his life. Thus, tho' Mo&s;es has recorded the time and manner of the Fall, yet there is no more occa&s;ion to have recour&s;e to his hi&s;tory to prove it, than to prove that man is a poor weak, vain, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, corrupt, depraved, &s;elf|i&s;h, &s;elf-tormenting, peri&s;hing creature; and that the world is a &s;ad mixture of imaginary
<PB N="4" REF="010918_0003_0F8528F3D9B35880">
good, and real evil, a mere &s;cene of vanity, vexation, and mi&s;ery. This is the known na|ture and condition both of man and the world; and every man is in him&s;elf an irre&s;i&s;tible proof that he is in a fallen &s;tate. An attempt therefore, to convince man of his Fall, as the Ground of his Redemption, mu&s;t be an at|tempt to do that which misfortunes, &s;ickne&s;s, pain, and the approach of death, have a na|tural tendency to do, to convince him of the Vanity, Poverty, and Mi&s;ery of his Life and Condition in this World; and how impo&s;&s;ible it is, that a GOD, Who has nothing in Him|&s;elf but Infinite Goodne&s;s and Infinite Happi|ne&s;s, &s;hould bring forth a race of intelligent creatures, that have neither Natural Goodne&s;s, nor Natural Happine&s;fs.</P>
<P>Man, in his Fir&s;t State, as he came forth from GOD, mu&s;t have been ab&s;olutely free from all Vanity, Want or Di&s;tre&s;s, of any kind, from any thing either within or without him: a God-like perfection of Nature, and a painful Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Nature, &s;tand in the utmo&s;t Contrariety to one another. But man has lo&s;t his Fir&s;t Divine Life in GOD: every thing that we know of God, and every thing that we know of man, of his birth, his life, and death, is a continual irre&s;i&s;tible proof that man is in a fallen &s;tate. The human infant ju&s;t come out of the womb, is a picture of &s;uch defor|mity, nakedne&s;s, weakne&s;s, and helple&s;s di&s;tre&s;s, as is not to be found among&s;t the home-born animals of this world. The chicken has its birth

from no &s;in, and, therefore, comes torth in beauty; it runs and pecks, as &s;oon as its &s;hell is broken: the calf and the lamb go both to play as foon as the dam is delivered of them; they are plea&s;ed with them&s;elves, and plea&s;e the eye that beholds their frolick &s;tate, and beau|teous cloathing: whil&s;t the new-born babe of a woman, that is to have an upright form; that is to view the heavens, and wor&s;hip the GOD that made them; lies, for months, in gro&s;s ignorance, weakne&s;s, and impurity; as &s;ad a &s;pectacle when he fir&s;t breathes the life of this world, as when in the agonies of death he breathes his la&s;t. What is all this, but the &s;trong&s;t proof, that man is the only creature that belongs not to this world, but is fallen in|to it through &s;in, and that, therefore, his birth, in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, bears all the&s;e marks of &s;hame and weakne&s;s? Had he been originally of this world, this world would have done the highe&s;t honour to its highe&s;t creature; and he mu&s;t have begun his life in greater perfection than any other animal, and brought with him a more beautiful cloathing than the fine&s;t lillies of the field. But when the human infant has at length acquired &s;trength, and begins to act for him&s;elf, he &s;oon becomes a more pitiable object than when crying in the cradle. The &s;trength of his life, is a meer &s;trength of wild pa&s;&s;ions; his rea&s;on is craft and &s;elfi&s;h &s;ubtilty; he loves and hates only as fle&s;h and blood prompt him; and jails and gibbets cannot keep

him from theft and murder. If he is rich, he is tormented with pride and ambition; if poor with want and di&s;content: be he which he will, &s;ooner or later, di&s;ordered pa&s;&s;ions, di&s;appoint|ed lu&s;ts, fruitle&s;s labour, pains and &s;ickne&s;s, will tear him from this world, in &s;uch travail as his mother felt, when &s;he brought forth the &s;inful animal. Now all this evil and mi&s;ery are the natural and nece&s;&s;ary effect of his birth in the be&s;tial fle&s;h and blood of this world; and there is nothing in his natural &s;tate, that can put a &s;top to it; he mu&s;t be evil and mi&s;erable as long as he has only the life of this world in him. Therefore, the ab&s;olute certainty of man's Fall, and the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of a New Birth to redeem him, are truths, independentl|y of Scripture, plain to a demonstration.</P>
<P>No creature can come from the hands of GOD, into a State of any Ignorance of any thing that is proper to be known by it: this is as impo&s;&s;ible, as for GOD to have an envious or evil will. Now all Right and Natural Knowledge, in whatever creature it is, is Sen&s;ible, Intuitive, and its own Evidence; and Opinion Rea&s;oning, or Doubting, can only then begin, when the creature has lo&s;t its Fir&s;t Right and Natural State, and is got &s;omewhere, and be|come &s;omewhat, that it cannot tell what to make of. Rea&s;oning, Doubt and Perplexity, in any creature, are the effect of &s;ome Fall or Departure from its Fir&s;t State of Nature; and &s;hew, that it wants, and is &s;eeking, &s;ome|thing
<PB N="7" REF="010918_0006_0F8528F5D6D352A0">
that belongs to its Nature, but knows how to come at it. The bea&s;ts &s;eek not after Truth; a plain proof that it has no Rela|tion to them, no Suitablene&s;s to their Nature, nor ever belonged to them. Man is in que&s;t of it, in perplexity about it, cannot come at it; takes lies to be Truth, and Truth to be lies: a plain proof, both that he has it not, and yet has had it; was created in it, and for it: for no creature can feek for any thing, but that which has been lo&s;t, and is wanted; nor could man form the lea&s;t idea of it, but becau&s;e it has belonged to him and ought to be his.</P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;e man to come into the world, with this Chief difference from other creatures, that he is at a lo&s;s to find out what he is, how he is to live, and what he is to &s;eek as his Chief Happine&s;s; what he is to own of a GOD, of Providence, Religion, &amp;<HI>c.</HI>; &s;uppo&s;e him to have Faculties that put him upon this Search, and no Faculties that can &s;atisfy his Inquiry; and what can we &s;uppo&s;e more mi&s;erable in him&s;elf, and more unworthy of a GOOD CREA|TOR? Therefore, if we will not &s;uppo&s;e, that GOD has been good to all creatures, and given every animal its Proper Light of Nature, ex|cept Man; we mu&s;t be forced to own, that man has lo&s;t the True Light and Perfection of his Nature which GOD at fir&s;t gave him.</P>
<P>GOD is in Himfelf, Infinite Truth, Infinite Goodne&s;s, and Infinite Happine&s;s; but man, in his pre&s;ent earthly birth and life, has neither
<PB N="8" REF="010918_0007_0F8528F6A8F18D58">
Truth, Goodne&s;s, nor Happine&s;s: therefore, his Pre&s;ent State of Life could not be brought, forth by that GOD, Who is all Truth, Good|ne&s;s, and Happine&s;s. Thus every man, that believes in a Creator Infinitely Perfect, is under a Nece&s;&s;ity of believing the Whole Ground of CHRISTIAN REDEMPTION, namely, that man has lo&s;t that Perfection of life which he had at fir&s;t from his Creator.</P>
<P>Had not a Divine Life at fir&s;t been in man, he would be now at the fame di&s;tance from Truth and Goodne&s;s, and as incapable of forming the lea&s;t Thought or De&s;ire of them, as the bea&s;ts of the field; and would have nothing to do, but to look to him&s;elf, live to his earthly nature, and make the mo&s;t of this world; for this is all the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s that an Earthly na|ture is capable of, whether it be a man, or a fox. The certainty of the fact, of man's Fir&s;t Divine Life is all; nothing more need be enquired after: for on This Ground &s;tands all his Comfort; hence it is, that in Faith and Hope he can look up to GOD as his Father, to Heaven as his Native Country, and on him|&s;elf as a &s;tranger and a pilgrim upon earth.</P>
<P>For it is a certain truth, that fallen earthly, and corrupt, as human nature is, there is, in the &s;oul of every man, the Fire, and Light, and Love of GOD, tho' lodged in a &s;tate of hiddenne&s;s and inactivity, till &s;omething human or Divine, Di&s;tre&s;s, or Grace, or both, di&s;co|ver its life vithin us.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010918_0008_0F8528F7782886A0">We were no more created to be in the Sor|rows, Burdens, and Angui&s;h of this earthly Life, than the Angels were created to be in the Wrath and Darkne&s;s of Hell. It is as contrary to the Will and Goodne&s;s of GOD towards us, that we are out of Paradi&s;e, as it is contrary to The De&s;igns and Goodne&s;s of GOD towards the Angels, that &s;ome of them are out of Hea|ven prisoners of darkne&s;s. How ab&s;urd and even bla&s;phemous would it be, to &s;ay, with the Church and the Scriptures, that <Q>we are Chil|dren of Wrath, and Born in Sin</Q> if we had That Nature, which GOD at fir&s;t gave us? What a reproach upon GOD, to &s;ay, that this world is a valley of mi&s;ery, a &s;hadow of death, full of di&s;orders, &s;orrows, and temptations, if This was an Original Creation, or That State of things for which God created us? It is not as con&s;i&s;tent with the Goodne&s;s of GOD, to &s;peak of the mi&s;ery and di&s;order that Holy Angels find above, and of the Sorrows and Vanity of their Heavenly State, as to &s;peak of the mi&s;ery of men and the &s;orrows and vanities of this world, if men and the world were in That Or|der, in which GOD at fir&s;t had placed them? If GOD could make any place Poor and Vain, and create any beings into a State of Vanity and Vexation of Spirit, he might do &s;o in all Places, and to All Beings.</P>
<P>The Fall of man, therefore, into the life of this earthly World, is the Sole Ground of his wanting the Redemption which the Go&s;pel offers. Hence it is, that The Go&s;pel has only
<PB N="10" REF="010918_0009_0F8528F8C5D6BC58">
One &s;imple propo&s;al of Certain Life, or Certain Death, to Man: of Life, if he will take the means of entering into The Kingdom of GOD; of Death, if he chu&s;es to take up his Re&s;t in The Kingdom of this World. This is the Sim|ple Nature and Sole Drift of The Go&s;pel: it means no more, than making known to man, that this World, and the Life of it, is his Fall and Separation from God and Happine&s;s both here and hereafter; and that to be &s;aved, or re|&s;tored to GOD and Happine&s;s, can only be obtained, by renouncing all Love and Adhe|rence to the Things of This World. All the Precepts, Threatenings and Doctrines of the Go&s;|pel, mean nothing, but to drive All Earthly|mindedne&s;s and Carnal Affections out of the &s;oul; to call man from the Life, Spirit, and Goods of This World, to a Life of Faith and Hope, and Love, and Defire, of a New Birth from Heaven.</P>
<P>To embrace The Go&s;pel, is to enter, with all our hearts, into its terms of dying to All that is Earthly, both within us and without us: and, on the other hand, to place our Faith, and Hope, and Tru&s;t, and Satisfaction, in the Things of this World; is to reject the Go&s;pel with our whole heart, &s;pirit, and &s;trength, as much as any Infidel can do, notwith&s;tanding we make ever &s;o many verbal a&s;&s;ents to every thing that is recorded in the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>This, therefore, is the one, true e&s;&s;ential Di&s;tinction, betwen the Chri&s;tian and the Infidel.
<PB N="11" REF="010918_0010_0F8528F8DE4CD600">
The Infidel is a man of This World; wholly devoted to it; his hope and Faith are &s;et upon it; for where our Heart is, there, and there only, are our hope and Faith: he has only &s;uch a Virtue, &s;uch a Goodne&s;s, and &s;uch a Reli|gion, as entirely &s;uits with the intere&s;ts of fle&s;h and blood, and keeps the &s;oul happy in <Q><HI>the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, the Lu&s;t of the Eye, and the Pride of life.</HI></Q> This, and this alone, is Infide|lity; a Total Separation from GOD, and a Removal of all Faith and Hope from HIM, into the Life of This World. It matters not, whether this Infidel be a Profe&s;&s;or of the Go&s;pel, a Di&s;ciple of Zoroa&s;ter, a Follower of Plato, a Jew, a Turk, or an Oppo&s;er of the Go&s;pel Hi|&s;tory: this Difference of Opinions or Profe&s;&s;ions alters not the matter; it is the Love of the World in&s;tead of GOD, that con&s;titutes the Whole Nature of the Infidel.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the Chri&s;tian renounces the world as his Horrid Pri&s;on; he dies to the will of fle&s;h and blood, becau&s;e it is Darkne&s;s, Corruption and Separation from GOD; he turns from all that is earthly, animal, and temporal, and &s;tands in a continual Tendency of Faith, and Hope, and Prayer to GOD, to have a better Nature, a better Life and Spirit, born again into him from above.</P>
<P>Where this Faith is, there is the Chri&s;tian, <Q><HI>The New Creature in</HI> CHRIST, <HI>born of the Word and Spirit of GOD:</HI></Q> neither time nor place, nor any outward condition of birth and
<PB N="12" REF="010918_0011_0F8528F996D7EE50">
life, can hinder his Entrance into the Kingdom of GOD. But where this Faith is not, there is the True Compleat Infidel, "<HI>The Man of Earth,</HI>" the Unredeemed, the Rejecter of the Go&s;pel, "<HI>the Son of Perdition,</HI>" that is <Q><HI>dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins, without</HI> CHRIST, <HI>an Alien from the Commonwealth of I&s;rael, a Stran|ger to the Covenants of promi&s;e, having no Hope, and without God in the World.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Men are apt to con&s;ider a Worldly Spirit only as an infirmity, or pardonable failure; but it is, indeed, The Great Apo&s;ta&s;y from GOD and the Divine Life: it is not a Single Sin, but the Whole Nature of All Sin; that leaves no po&s;&s;ibility of coming out of our fallen &s;tate, till it be totally renounced with all the &s;trength of our hearts.</P>
<P>Our LORD &s;ays, <Q><HI>there is but One that is Good and that is GOD.</HI></Q> In the &s;ame &s;trict|ne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion it mu&s;t be &s;aid, "There is but One Life that is Good, and that is THE LIFE OF GOD AND HEAVEN:" Depart, in the lea&s;t degree, from the Goodne&s;s of GOD, and you depart into evil; becau&s;e nothing is good, but His Goodne&s;s. Choo&s;e any life, but THE LIFE OF GOD AND HEAVEN, and you choo&s;e Death; for Death is nothing el&s;e but the Lo&s;&s; of THE LIFE OF GOD. The creatures of this world, have but one life, and one good; and that is the life of this world; eternal beings have but one life, and one good; and that is THE LIFE OF GOD The &s;pirit of the &s;oul is

in it&s;elf nothing el&s;e but a Spirit breathed forth from GOD, that The Life of GOD, the Na|ture of GOD, The Working of GOD, The Tempers of GOD, might be manife&s;ted in it. GOD could not create man to have a will of his own, and a life of his own, different from the Life and Will that is in Him&s;elf: this is more impo&s;&s;ible than for a good tree to bring forth corrupt fruit. GOD can only delight in His Own Life, His Own Goodne&s;s, and His Own Perfections; and, therefore, cannot love, or delight, or dwell, in any Creatures, but where His Own Goodne&s;s and Perfections are to be found: like can only unite with like, hea|ven with heaven, and hell with hell; and, there|fore, THE LIFE OF GOO mu&s;t be the Life of the &s;oul, if the &s;oul is to unite with GOD. Hence it is, that All the Religion of fallen man, All the Methods of our Redemption, have only this One End, to take from us That Strange and Earthly Life we have gotten by the Fall, and to kindle again THE LIFE OF GOD AND HEA|VEN in our &s;ouls: not to deliver us from that gro&s;s and fordid vice called Covetou&s;ne&s;s, which Heathens can condemn; but to take The Spirit of This World entirely from us.</P>
<P>This Spirit is the Whole Nature and Mi&s;ery of our Fall; it keeps our &s;ouls in a &s;tate of Death; and, as long as it governs, makes it impo&s;&s;ible for us to be "<HI>Bom again from A|bove.</HI>" It is the greate&s;t Blindne&s;s and Darkne&s;s of our nature, and keeps us in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Ig|norance

both of heaven and hell; for tho' they are both of them within us, yet we feel neither, while the Spirit of this World reigns in us. Light, and Truth, and the Go&s;pel, &s;o far as they concern Eternity, are all empty founds to the Worldly Spirit: his own good, and his own evil, govern all his hopes and fears; and, therefore, he can have no religion, or be farther concerned in it, than &s;o far as it can be made &s;erviceable to the Life of This World: he can know nothing of GOD; for he can know nothing, feel nothing, ta&s;te nothing, delight in nothing, but with earthly &s;en&s;es, and after an earthly manner. <Q><HI>The Natural Man,</HI> faith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>receiv|eth not the Things of</HI> THE SPIRIT OF GOD; <HI>they are fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him: he cannot know them, becau&s;e they are Spiritually di&s;cerned,</HI></Q> that is, they can only be di&s;cerned by That Spi|rit which he hath not: he can only contemplate them, as things foreign to him&s;elf; as &s;o many changeable ideas, which he receives from books, or hear&s;ay, and which become a bad nouri&s;h|ment of all his natural tempers: he is proud of his ability to di&s;cour&s;e about them, and lo&s;es all Humility, all Love of GOD and man, thro' a vain and haughty contention for them. He &s;tands at the &s;ame di&s;tance from a living per|ception of the Truth, as the man, that is born blind, does from a living perception of Light; Light mu&s;t fir&s;t be the birth of his own life, before he can enter into a real knowledge of it.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="010918_0014_0F8528FD75EAB818">The mea&s;ure of our Life, is the mea&s;ure of our knowledge; and as the Spirit of our Life worketh, &s;o the &s;pirit of our under&s;tanding con|ceiveth. If our Will worketh with GOD, tho' our natural capacity be ever &s;o mean and narrow, we get a real knowledge of GOD, and Heavenly Truths; for every thing mu&s;t feel that, in which it lives. But if our Will worketh with Satan, and The Spirit of This World, let our parts be ever &s;o bright, our imaginations ever &s;o &s;oaring; yet all our Living Knowledge can go no higher or deeper, than the my&s;teries or iniquity, and the lu&s;ts of fle&s;h and blood. For nothing feels, or ta&s;tes, or under&s;tands, or likes, or di&s;likes, but The Life that is in us: The Spirit that leads our Life, is The Spirit that forms our under&s;tand|ing. The mind is our eye, and all the faculties of the mind fee every thing according to The State the mind is in. If Selfi&s;h Pride is The Spirit of our Life, every thing is only &s;een, and known, through this gla&s;s; every thing is dark, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and ab&s;urd, to the Proud Man, but that which brings food to This Spirit: he under&s;tands nothing, feels nothing, ta&s;tes nothing, but as his Pride is made &s;en&s;ible of it, or capable of being affected with it. His Working Will, which is The Life of his &s;oul liveth and worketh only in the Element of Pride; and, therefore, what &s;uits his Pride, is his only good; and what contradicts his Pride, is all the evil that he can feel or know: his wit, his parts,

his learning, his advancement, his friends, his admirers, his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, his conque&s;ts, all the&s;e are the Only God and Heaven, that he has any Living Perception of: he indeed can talk of a Scripture God, a Scripture Chri&s;t, and Heaven; but the&s;e are only the ornamental furniture of his brain, whil&s;t Pride is the God of his heart. We are told that <Q><HI>GOD re&s;i&s;teth the Proud, and giveth Grace to the Humble.</HI></Q> This is not to be under&s;tood, as if GOD by an arbitrary will, only cho&s;e to deal thus with the Proud and Humble man. But the true ground is this: The Re&s;i&s;tance is on the Part of man. Pride re&s;i&s;teth GOD, it rejecteth Him, it turneth from Him, and choo&s;eth to wor&s;hip and adore &s;omething el&s;e in&s;tead of Him: whereas Humility leaveth all for GOD., falls down before him, and opens the whole heart to receive Him. This is the only &s;en&s;e, in which <Q><HI>GOD re&s;i&s;teth the proud and giveth Grace to the Humble.</HI></Q> And thus it is in the true ground of every Good and Evil that ri&s;es up in us; we have neither Good nor Evil, but as it is the Natural Effect of the working of our Own Will, either with, or again&s;t God. Con&s;ider the &s;tate of him, who&s;e Working Will is under the Power of Wrath; he fees and hears, and feels, and under&s;tands, and talks, wholly from the Light and Sen&s;e of Wrath.

are &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that The State of our Life governs the &s;tate of our mind, and forms the degree and manner of our under&s;tanding and knowledge; and that, therefore, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of knowing GOD and Divine Truths, till our Life is Divine, and wholly dead to The Life and Sprit of This World.</P>
<P>The philo&s;ophers of old began all their Virtue, in a total Renunciation of the Spirit of this World. They &s;aw, with the eyes of Heaven, that dark|ne&s;s was not more contrary to light, than The Wi&s;dom of This World was contrary to the Spi|rit of Virtue: therefore, they allowed of no Pro|gre&s;s in Virtue, but &s;o far as a man had overcome him&s;elf, and The Spirit of This World. This gave a Divine &s;olidity to all their in&s;tructions, and proved them to be ma&s;ters of True Wi&s;dom. But the doctrine of THE CROSS OF CHRIST, the laft, the highe&s;t, the fini&s;hing &s;troke given to the Spirit of This World, that &s;peaks more in One Word than all the philo|&s;ophy of voluminous writers; is yet profe&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e, who are in more friend&s;hip with The World, than was allowed to the di&s;ciples of Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, or Epidetus.</P>
<P>Nay, if tho&s;e antient &s;ages were to &s;tart up among&s;t us with their Divine Wi&s;dom, they would bid fair to be treated by the Sons of the Go&s;pel, if not by fome Fathers of the Church, as dreaming enthu&s;ia&s;ts. But it is a &s;tanding truth, that <Q>The World can only love its own, and Wi&s;dom can only be ju&s;tified of her Chil|dren.</Q> The Heaven-born Epictetus told one
<PB N="18" REF="010918_0017_0F8528FFA75BED80">
of his &s;cholars, that <Q>then he might fir&s;t look upon him&s;elf, as having made &s;ome true pro|ficiency in Virtue, when the World took him for a fool;</Q> an oracle like that, which &s;aid, <Q><HI>The Wi&s;dom of This World is Fooli&s;hne&s;s with</HI> GOD.</Q></P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked, what is the Apo&s;tasy of the&s;e la&s;t times, or whence is the Degeneracy of the present Chri&s;tian Church, it is all the progeny of a Worldly Spirit. If here we &s;ee open wick|edne&s;s, there only forms of godline&s;s; if here &s;uperficial holine&s;s, political piety, crafty pru|dence; there haughty fancity, partial zeal, en|vious orthodoxy: if almo&s;t every where we find a Jewish blindne&s;s, and hardne&s;s of heart; and the Church trading with the Gospel as vi&s;ibly as the old Jews bought and fold bea&s;ts in their Temple: all this is only &s;o many forms and pro|per fruits, of the Worldly Spirit. This is the great chain with which the Devil en&s;laves man|kind; and every &s;on of man is held captive in it, till through, and by, THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST he breaks from it. Nothing el&s;e can deliver him from it: nothing leaves the World, nothing renounces it, nothing can possibly o|vercome it, but THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST. Hence it is, that many learned men, with all the rich furniture of their brain, live and die &s;laves to The Spirit of This World; and can only differ from gro&s;s worldlings, as the Scribes and Phari&s;ees differed from publicans and &s;inners: it is because THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST
<PB N="19" REF="010918_0018_0F852900700384E8">
is not the One Only Thing that is the De&s;ire of their hearts; and, therefore, their learning on|ly works in and with The Spirit of This World, and becomes it&s;elf no &s;mall part of the <Q>Vanity of vanities.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nothing does, or can, keep GOD out of the &s;oul, or hinder His Holy Union with it, but its desire turned from him:</Q> for with whatever the Will worketh, with that only the &s;oulliveth, whether it be GOD or the creature. Whatever the &s;oul de&s;ireth, that is the fewel of its fire; and as its fewel is, so is the flame of its Life. A will given up to earthly enjoyments is at gra&s;s with Nebuchadnezzar, and has One Life with the bea&s;ts of the field; for Earthly De&s;ires keep up the Same Life in a man and an ox. For the one only rea&s;on, why the animals of this world have no &s;en&s;e or knowledge of GOD, is because they cannot form any other than Earth|ly De&s;ires, and &s;o can only have an Earthly Life: when, therefore, a man wholly turneth his Will to Earthly De&s;ires, he dies to the excellency of his natural &s;tate, and may be &s;aid only to live, and move, and have his being in The Life of This World, as the bea&s;ts have. Earthly food, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> only desired, and u&s;ed, for the support of the earthly body, is &s;uitable to man's pre&s;ent condition, and the order of nature: but when the De&s;ire and Delight of the &s;oul are &s;et upon Earthly Things, the humanity is degraded, is fal|len from GOD, and The Life of the Soul is made as earthly and be&s;tial, as the Life of the body,
<PB N="20" REF="010918_0019_0F85290116415B70">
for the creature can be neither higher or lower, neither better nor wor&s;e than as its Will work|eth. What it de&s;ireth, that it taketh; and of that it eateth and liveth : wherever, and in whatever, the Will cho&s;eth to dwell and delight, that becometh the &s;oul's Food, its Condition, its Body, its Cloathing, and Habitation. No|thing doth, or can, go with a man into heaven, nothing followeth him into hell, but that in which the Will dwelt, with which it was fed, nouri&s;hed, and cloathed, in This Life. Death can make no Alteration of This State of the Will: it only takes off the outward, worldly, covering of fle&s;h and blood, and forces the &s;oul to fee, and feel, and know, what a Life, what a State, Food, Body, and Habitation, its own Working Will has brought forth for it. Is there, there|fore, any thing in Life that de&s;erves a thought, but how to keep this Working of our Will in a Right State; and to get that Purity of Heart, which alone can fee, and know, and find, and po&s;&s;e&s;s GOD? Is there any thing &s;o frightful as This Worldly Spirit, which turns the &s;oul from GOD; makes it a Hou&s;e of Darkne&s;s; and feeds it with the Food of Time, at the Ex|pence of All the Riches of Eternity?</P>
<P>Now as the Whole Nature of the Gospel Re|demption means nothing, but the one, true and only po&s;&s;ible Way, of delivering man from All the Evil of his Fall &mdash; a Fall demon&s;trable to the &s;en&s;es and understanding of every man, by every height and depth of nature, by every kind of
<PB N="21" REF="010918_0020_0F8529021D1C4540">
evil &s;in and mi&s;ery in this world, by every thing he knows of GOD, him&s;elf, and the world he lives in; Chri&s;tianity is not only the mo&s;t de&s;ireable thing that the heart of man can think of, but the mo&s;t intelligible, and even &s;elf-evi|dent. It requires not the aid of learning for its &s;upport; it &s;tands upon a Foundation &s;uperiour to Human Learning, and may be the Sure Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of every Plain Man, who has &s;en&s;e enough to know, whether he is happy or unhappy, good or evil. For this natural knowledge, is adhered to, is every man's Sure Guide to that One Salvation preached by the Go&s;pel; which Go&s;|pel &s;tands in no more need or Learning and Critical Art now, than it did when CHRI&s;T was preaching it upon earth. How ab&s;urd would it have been for any Critics in Greek and Hebrew, to have followed Chri&s;t and his Apo|&s;tles, as nece&s;&s;ary explainers of their Words, which called for nothing in the hearers, but Penitent Hearts turned to GOD; and declared, that " <HI>They only who, were of GOD, could bear the Word of GOD!</HI>" If none but Learned men have the True Fitne&s;s to under&s;tand the Word of Scripture, and the Plain man is to receive it from them; how mu&s;t he know, which are the Scholars that have the Right Knowledge? Whence is he to have his information? For no one need be told, that, ever &s;ince Learning has born rule in the church, Learned Doctors have contradicted and condemned each other, in every E&s;&s;ential Point of the Chri&s;tian Doc|trine:
<PB N="22" REF="010918_0021_0F852902A06C4330">
thou&s;ands of Learned men tell the illite|rate, they are lo&s;t in this or that Church; and thou&s;ands or Learned men tell them, they are lo&s;t if they leave it. If, therefore, Chri&s;tianity is in the Hands of Scholars, how mu&s;t the Plain man come at it? Mu&s;t he, though unable to under&s;tand Scripture for want of Learning, tell which Learned man is in the right, and which is not? If &s;o, the Unlearned man mu&s;t have far the greate&s;t Ability, &s;ince he is to do That for Scholars, which they cannot do for Them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But Chri&s;tian Redemption is GOD's Mercy to All mankind: and every Fallen man, as &s;uch, has a Fitne&s;s of Capacity to lay hold of it. It has no dependence upon times and places, or the ages and &s;everal conditions of the world, or any outward circum&s;tance of life; as the Fir&s;t man partook of it, &s;o mu&s;t the La&s;t: the Lear|ned Lingui&s;t, the blind, the deaf and dumb, have but One and the Same Common Way of finding Life in it; and he that writes large commentaries upon the Bible, mu&s;t be faved by Something full as different from book know|ledge, as he who can neither write nor read.</P>
<P>For This Salvation, which is GOD's mercy to the Fallen Soul of man, merely as Fallen, mu&s;t be Something that meets every man; and to which every man, as Fallen, has Something that directs him to turn. For as the Fall of man is the Rea&s;on of his mercy, &s;o the Fall mu&s;t be the Guide to it: the Want mu&s;t &s;hew the Thing that is wanted. And, therefore,
<PB N="23" REF="010918_0022_0F85290355B5C8F8">
The Manife&s;tation of this One Salvation, of Mercy to man, mu&s;t have a Nature &s;uitable, not to this or that great Reader of Hi&s;tory, or able Critic in Hebrew Roots or Greek Phra&s;es, but &s;uitable to the Common State and Condition of every Son of Adam. It mu&s;t be Something as grounded in human nature, as the Fall itfelf is; which wants no Art to make it known, but to which the Common Nature of man is the Sure and Only Guide, in one man as well as another. Now this Something, which is thus obvious to every man, and which opens The Way to Chri&s;tian Redemption in every &s;oul, is <Q>A Sen&s;e of the Vanity and Mi&s;ery of this World; and a Prayer of Faith and Hope to GOD, to be rai&s;ed to a Better State.</Q></P>
<P>In this Sen&s;e, to which every man's own Nature leads him, lies the Whole of man's Salvation; here the Mercy of GOD, and the Mi&s;ery of man, are met together; here the Fall and the Redemption ki&s;s each other. This is the Chri&s;tianity which is as old as the Fall; which alone faved the Fir&s;t man, and can alone &s;ave the La&s;t. This is it, on which hang all the Law and the Prophets, and which fulfils them both; for they have only this End, to turn man from the Lu&s;ts of this Life, to a De&s;ire and Faith, and Hope of a better. Thus does the Whole of Chri&s;tian Redemption, con&s;idered on the part of man, &s;tand in the &s;ame Degree of Nearne&s;s and Plainne&s;s to All Mankind: it is as &s;imple and plain, as the Feeling our Own
<PB N="24" REF="010918_0023_0F85290771B9D7D8">
Evil and Mi&s;ery and as natural, as the De&s;ire of being &s;aved and delivered from it.</P>
<P>This De&s;ire and Faith and Hope of A NEW LIFE BORN OF GOD, as our only po&s;&s;ible Re|demption and Salvation, is The Spirit of Prayer, that is as oppo&s;ite to the Spirit of This World as Heaven is to hell: the one goes upwards with the Same Strength as the other goes downwards; the one e&s;pou&s;es and unites us to CHRIST and GOD, with the Same Certainty, as the other betrothsand weds us to an Earthly Nature. The Spirit of Prayer is a pre&s;&s;ing forth of this &s;oul out of this Earthly Life; it is a &s;tretching, with all its De&s;ire, after THE LIFE OF GOD; it is a leaving, as far as it can, All its Own Spirit, to receive a Spirit from above, to be One Life, One Love, One Spirit, with CHRIST IN GOD. This Prayer, which is an emptying it&s;elf of all its Own lu&s;ts and natural tempers, and an open|ing it&s;elf for The Light and Love of GOD to enter into it, is the Prayer in "<HI>The Name of</HI> CHRIST," to which nothing is denied: for The Love which GOD bears to the &s;oul, His Eter|nal Never-cea&s;ing De&s;ire to enter into it, to dwell in it, and open The Birth of His Holy WORD and SPIRIT in it, &s;tays no longer, than till the heart opens to receive Him. For <Q>no|thing does, or can, keep GOD out of the &s;oul, or hinder His Holy Union with it, but the De&s;ire of the Heart turned from him.</Q></P>
<P>What, therefore, is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for man, as, with all his Strength, to turn from every thing
<PB N="25" REF="010918_0024_0F85290827A790C8">
is not GOD, and His Holy Will; and with All the De&s;ire, Delight, and Longing of the Heart, to give up him&s;elf wholly to The Life, Light, and Spirit of God; plea&s;ed with nothing in This World, but as it gives time, and place and occa&s;ions of doing and being That, which his Heavenly Father would have him to do, and be; &s;eeking for no Happine&s;s from this earthly fallen Life, but That of Overcoming All its Spirit and Tempers?</P>
<P>To conclude: In the full and true knowledge of The Greatne&s;s of our Fall, and The Greatne&s;s of our Redemption, lie all the rea&s;ons of a deep Humility, Penitence and Self-denial; and al&s;o all the motives and incitements to a mo&s;t hearty, &s;in|cere, and total Conver&s;ion to GOD: and every one is nece&s;&s;arily more or le&s;s a True Penitent, and more or le&s;s Truly Converted to GOD, ac|cording as he is more or le&s;s deeply or inwardly Sen&s;ible of the&s;e Truths. And till the&s;e two great Truths have both awakened and enlight|ened our minds, all Reformation and pretence to Amendment, is but a dead and &s;uperficial thing, a mere garment of hypocri&s;y, to hide us from our&s;elves and others.</P>
<P>Nothing can truly awaken a &s;inner, but a True Sen&s;e of the Deep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Power that Sin has in him. When he &s;ees, that Sin begins with his Being, that it ri&s;es up in the E&s;|&s;ences of his Nature, and lives in the Fir&s;t Forms of his Life; and that he lies thus chained and barred up in the very jaws of death and hell, as unable to alter his own State as to create another
<PB N="26" REF="010918_0025_0F852909910EAB30">
creature: when, with this knowledge, he &s;ees that the Free Grace of GOD has provided him a Remedy equal to his Di&s;tre&s;s; that he has given him the Holy Blood and Life of JESUS CHRIST, the True Son of GOD, to enter as deep into his Soul as Sin has entered, to change the Fir&s;t Forms and E&s;&s;ences of his Life, and bring forth in them a New Birth of a Divine Nature, that is to be an Immortal Image of THE HOLY TRINITY, everla&s;tingly &s;afe, enrich|ed, and ble&s;&s;ed, in the Bo&s;om of FATHER, SON, AND HOLY GHOST; when a man once feel&s; the&s;e two Truths, there &s;eems to be no more that you need do for him. You can tell him of no Humility and Penitence, and Self-aba&s;e|ment, but what is le&s;s than his own heart &s;ug|ge&s;ts to him: Humility can only be feigned or fal&s;e, before this Conviction: he can now no more take any degree of Good to him&s;elf, than a&s;&s;ume any Share in the creation of An|gels; and all Pride or Self-e&s;teem of any kind, &s;eems to him to contain as great a Lye in it, as if he was to &s;ay, that he helped to create him&s;elf.</P>
<P>You need not tell him, that he mu&s;t turn unto GOD with <Q><HI>all his Strength, all his Heart, all his Soul, and all his Spirit</HI>;</Q> for all that he can offer unto GOD, &s;eems to him already le&s;s than the lea&s;t of His Mercies towards him.

<PB N="27" REF="010918_0026_0F85290A25908FD8">
&s;o it has but one De&s;ire, and that is, to be it&s;elf All Love of GOD.</P>
<P>This is the Conviction and Conver&s;ion that nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;es from a right under&s;tanding of the&s;e Truths: the &s;oul is thereby wholly Con|&s;ecrated to GOD; and can like, or love, or do nothing, but what it can, &s;ome way or other, turn into a Service of love towards Him: but where the&s;e Truths are not known, or not ac|knowledged; there it is not to be wondered at, if Religion has no Root, that is able to bring forth its proper Fruits. And if the Generality of Chri&s;tians are a number of dead, &s;uperficial, Con|&s;enters to the Hi&s;tory of Scripture doctrines; as unwilling to have the Spirit, as to part with the Form of their Religion, loth to hear of any kind of Self-denial, fond of Worldly Ea&s;e, Indul|gence and Riches; unwilling to be called to The Perfection of the Go&s;pel, profe&s;&s;ing and prac|ti&s;ing Religion merely as the Fa&s;hion and Cu|&s;tom of the place they are in requires; if &s;ome re&s;t in outward Forms, others in a certain Or|thodoxy of opinions; if &s;ome expect to be &s;aved by the goodne&s;s of the Sect they are of, others by a certain change of their outward Behaviour; if &s;ome content them&s;elves with a Lukewarm Spirit, and others depend upon Their Own Works; the&s;e are Delu&s;ions that mu&s;t happen to all, who do not know, in &s;ome good degree, the true nature of their own Fallen Soul, and what Kind of Regeneration alone can &s;ave them.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e errours, delu&s;ions, and fal&s;e re&s;ts, are cut up by the Root, as &s;oon as a man knows
<PB N="28" REF="010918_0027_0F85290AE763E0A8">
the True Rea&s;on and Nece&s;&s;ity of his wanting &s;o Great a Saviour. For he that knows the E&s;&s;ences of his Soul to be &s;o many E&s;&s;ences of Sin, which form Sin as they form his Life; entirely incapable of producing Any Good, till a Birth from GOD has ari&s;en in them; can neither place his Redemption where it is not, nor &s;eek it cooly and negligently where it is.</P>
<P>For knowing that it is the Hell within his own nature, that only wants to be de&s;troyed, he is intent only upon bringing De&s;truction upon That; and this &s;ecures him from Fal&s;e Religion.</P>
<P>And knowing that this Inward Hell cannot be de&s;troyed, unle&s;s GOD becomes his REDEEMER, or REGENERATOR, in the E&s;&s;ences of his &s;oul; this makes him believe all, expect all, and hope all, from his Saviour JESUS CHRIST alone.</P>
<P>And knowing, that All this Redemption, or Salvation, is to be brought about in the In|mo&s;t Ground and Depth of his Heart; this makes him always apply to GOD, as the GOD of his Heart; and, therefore, what he offers to GOD is his own Heart; and this keeps him always Spiritually alive, wholly employed and intent upon the True Work of Religion, the fit|ting and preparing his Heart for all the Opera|tions of GOD's HOLY SPIRIT upon it. And &s;o he is a True Inward Chri&s;tian, who, as our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD &s;peaks has, <Q><HI>"The Kingdom of GOD within him,"</HI></Q> where the State and Habit of his Heart continually, thankfully <Q>WORSHIPS THE FATHER IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH.</Q></P>
