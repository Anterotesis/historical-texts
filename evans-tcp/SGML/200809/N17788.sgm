<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE author of this &s;hort Tour in Holland, had not an idea of &s;ubmitting his remarks in that country to the publick, at the time they were made&mdash;The carele&s;s and irregular manner in which it is written will fully evince this truth.&mdash;However, as &s;everal of his friends importuned him to pub|li&s;h it, in its original native &s;tate, he has a&s;&s;ented; having previou&s;ly &s;olicited the can|did critici&s;m of the celebrated author of <HI>M'Fingal,</HI> from who&s;e letter on this &s;ubject the author has made free to extract the fol|lowing remarks, viz.</P>
<P>"IN America we know little of Hol|land&mdash;nor do I believe the Engli&s;h in gen|eral
<PB N="vi" REF="023039_0003_0FBB744DDDCF2250">
know much more. The nobility and gentry, who take the tour of Europe, &s;eldom vi&s;it the Netherlands, and the remarks of Engli&s;h travellers, which I have &s;een, &s;eem not to extend beyond the city of Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>"THE be&s;t account of the Dutch manners I have met with, is contained in the <HI>Adele and Theodore</HI> of the counte&s;s <HI>de Genlis,</HI> who occa&s;ionally paints the manners in &s;ome of their towns, particularly in Broeck, Sar|dan, &amp;c. in perfect conformity to your de|&s;criptions.</P>
<P>"THE con&s;titution of the United Nether|lands has been attended to by writers on gov|ernment; but an accurate account of trav|els in that nation, de&s;cribing the face of the country, and the manners of the inhabitants, is, &s;o far as my reading extends, as yet un|&s;upplied in Engli&s;h, as well as American literature. I am of opinion that your e&s;&s;ay will &s;upply it, as far as can be expected

from &s;o &s;hort a tour through the principal cities.</P>
<P>"I AM plea&s;ed with your de&s;criptions, your &s;entiments, and your general manner of expre&s;&s;ing them, and mu&s;t thank you for the valuable information I have received from them, of the country and manners of the Dutch.</P>
<P>"YOUR &s;tyle may be critici&s;ed by illna|tured, &s;chola&s;tick pedants, but will not be blamed with any &s;everity by others. An ea&s;y, lively, familiar &s;tyle, approaching even to carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, is be&s;t &s;uited to a work of this kind, and will give more plea&s;ure to read|ers in general, than the laborious &s;tiffne&s;s and pedantry of <HI>John&s;on,</HI> or the florid ele|gance of <HI>Gibbon.</HI> Let <HI>mere &s;cholars</HI> pay more attention to words than things, and be prai&s;ed by <HI>mere &s;cholars,</HI> for their &s;kill in arranging them like &s;oldiers on the parade, and marching them off properly by divi&s;ions&mdash;
<PB N="viii" REF="023039_0005_0FBB7451B8B9D5D8">
This is not the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e who write to in&s;truct, entertain and be under|&s;tood.</P>
<P>"IN many pa&s;&s;ages, which I have pa&s;&s;ed over, I &s;hould have &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome little al|teration, if I could have had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you. But as they would have requir|ed a change of a &s;entence, I could not alter them without changing the colour of the &s;tyle, and often de&s;troying its genuine <HI>na&iuml;vet&eacute;.</HI> However, I think you may &s;afely leave them as they are, for the &s;mall criticks to nibble upon; for as <HI>they</HI> are the proper dome&s;ticks in the literary family, it is but ju&s;t that their ma&s;ters &s;hould give them &s;ome crumbs for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence."</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR BROTHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_EXPERIENCE every day convinces me, that no &s;ituation in life is more di&s;gu&s;ting to an active mind, than to have noth|ing to do.&mdash;The pre&s;|ent moment &s;eems a vacuum in my exi&s;tence; at night I look back with re|gret
<PB N="10" REF="023039_0007_0FBB9EB71E2E2688">
to find the be&s;t hours of my life mouldering away in the cau&s;e of in|dolence.</P>
<P>THE mind of man mu&s;t re&s;t on &s;ome pur&s;uit, or he will drift among the rocks of di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>THE only hours in which I can rel|i&s;h any &s;atisfaction, are tho&s;e I pa&s;s in the country; but my affairs often call me to this va&s;t metropolis, which to me is the mo&s;t &s;oul &s;inking place I ever was in; and, in truth, the la&s;t retreat for an American to enjoy that &s;ocial plea&s;|ure, neighbourly intercour&s;e, and cor|dial friend&s;hip, which con&s;titute &s;o large a proportion of our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>EVERY family here are wrapt up with|in them&s;elves, and mea&s;ure their neigh|bour's merit by his pur&s;e and equipage: In &s;hort, the whole city is a great gulph
<PB N="11" REF="023039_0008_0FBB9EBD578DA1F0">
of riches and vice, and every particle of air &s;eems impregnated with corruption: Indeed I find there is no happine&s;s equal to that which re&s;ults from virtue, tem|perance and indu&s;try. The more I &s;ee of mankind, the more I am convinced of this truth, and the le&s;s reconciled to their vanities and follies. Do not &s;up|po&s;e that I have been po&s;ting about up|on the globe for nearly ten years togeth|er, and am at la&s;t dive&s;ted of tho&s;e liber|al ideas I have endeavoured to cheri&s;h&mdash; No! I have lei&s;urely traver&s;ed old Eng|land in almo&s;t every direction, and, di|ve&s;ted of prejudice, I am ready to allow it the full weight of its merit: Take the kingdom all in all, I am per&s;uaded there is no country which has a better claim to deci&s;ive bravery, and improvements in agriculture and the arts; but we have found the important my&s;tery of being much happier than the Engli&s;h, which may perhaps be imputed to a great
<PB N="12" REF="023039_0009_0FBB9EBE651BF060">
depravity of their morals, as it &s;eems generally confe&s;&s;ed that their former en|vied national character no more exi&s;ts, and that we now inherit in Neweng|land tho&s;e ma&s;culine virtues which di&s;|tingui&s;hed them &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly in the la&s;t century.</P>
<P>HEAVEN defend our po&s;terity from the &s;ame degeneracy! If the con&s;equence is no le&s;s than the lo&s;s of their happine&s;s, how much ought we to exert our&s;elves to pre&s;erve and perpetuate, our &s;im|plicity of manners, in their native pu|rity?</P>
<P>I HAVE almo&s;t run through my let|ter without telling you the only thing I meant to &s;ay at fir&s;t; which was, that I am ju&s;t on the wing for Holland, without any view of bu&s;ine&s;s; but as I ab&s;olutely begin to ru&s;t for want of activity, I mean to rub my&s;elf a little

bright among the Mynheers and Mav|rows. I have hunted over half the book|&s;tores in this city for &s;ome good de&s;crip|tion of that artificial country, but, to my a&s;toni&s;hment, I cannot find any &s;uf|ficiently accurate, either to furni&s;h ju&s;t ideas, or to &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity&mdash;and as I know we have but little better know|ledge of Holland in America, than of O|taheite, I will endeavour to make &s;uch remarks as will at lea&s;t impre&s;s the ob|jects on my own mind, and perhaps a|mu&s;e &s;ome of my American friends. Linked as we are in our political con|nexion with Holland, our ignorance on this head is much to be lamented.&mdash; Adieu!</P>

<SALUTE>JOURNAL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FIVE o'clock this morning left the King's Arms Inn, on my way to Harwich, with &s;everal jovial compan|ions, bound to Holland.</P>
<P>THE morning was &s;erene, with a clear blue &s;ky, and the air &s;weetly per|fumed.</P>
<P>THE country from London to Har|wich is all in the county of E&s;&s;ex, and finely cultivated. We pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal con&s;iderable villages, and by many elegant &s;eats. E&s;&s;ex is celebrated for grain and cattle. We breakfa&s;ted at Inger|&s;tole,
<PB N="15" REF="023039_0012_0FBB9EC2F0FFA7C8">
twenty three miles from London, and pa&s;&s;ed the time &s;o merrily to Col|che&s;ter, fifty two miles, that we were hardly &s;en&s;ible of the ground or time we mea&s;ured.</P>
<P>COLCHESTER is a large town, built principally upon a plea&s;ant, healthy eminence, and celebrated for good oy|&s;ters. The &s;treets are clean, and the hou&s;es all white; but the pavements rough. Our landlord tells us, they count &s;ixteen pari&s;hes, and fourteen thou&s;and inhabitants, who carry on largely in the manufactory of flannels and baizes, known by the name of Col|che&s;ter baizes.</P>
<P>IN eight or nine miles from this town we arrived on the borders of the Stour, or tide river, and found the country exceedingly romantick and agreeable until we reached Harwich.
<PB N="16" REF="023039_0013_0FBB9EC4844B6938">
In the neighbourhood of this place we pa&s;&s;ed the &s;uperb &s;eat of Richard Rigby, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> upon our right, and a &s;eventy four gun &s;hip on the &s;tocks, on our left; immediately after which, from the &s;ummit of a hill, the German ocean &s;uddenly opened to our view.</P>
<P>HARWICH is a villanous dirty little hole, but the Packet being ready to weigh anchor, we were &s;peedily reliev|ed from the impo&s;itions to which &s;tran|gers are ever &s;ubject in &s;uch places.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>HELVOETSLUYS, <DATE>27th May, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will readily acknow|ledge my punctuality, when I a&s;&s;ure you, that I arrived here but a few hours &s;ince, and have already a&s;&s;umed my pen to give you an account of a country I have hardly yet &s;et foot into; but as the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion is always the mo&s;t forcible, when one is plunged as it were into a new region of phizes and fa&s;hions, where art and nature both a&s;&s;ume a different a&s;pect, I &s;hall endeavour to follow the current of my feelings from the mo|ment we &s;et &s;ail from Harwich, to the
<PB N="18" REF="023039_0015_0FBB9ECA35561550">
pre&s;ent; after which, you may expect a more detailed account, as I become more thoroughly acquainted; for I will freely confe&s;s my total ignorance both of the nation, and the geography of the coun|try. To paint the contra&s;t of objects in &s;trong colours admits of no delay, for once familiarized with them&mdash;the novel|ty cea&s;es. Before I proceed I mu&s;t vent my &s;pleen again&s;t the villanous &s;earch officers at Harwich, who extorted money from each of us for doing what they are paid for. I contended in vain to oppo&s;e their inju&s;tice, but was reluctant|ly forced to bend to the rod, or &s;ubmit to delay and inconvenience. We weigh|ed anchor on board the Prince of Wales, Capt. Hearn, at &s;even o'clock in the evening, and &s;tood along the Suffolk coa&s;t to the northward, to avoid &s;ome &s;hoals, and then hauled E. S. E. I wi&s;hed much to remain on deck all the evening, but the atmo&s;phere was wild, and heav|ily
<PB N="19" REF="023039_0016_0FBB9ECDC7F57DA8">
charged with hanging clouds; which were &s;o uncivil as to &s;ift their waters upon us, and oblige us to decamp be|low; where we immediately &s;towed our|&s;elves away in &s;nug little cabins, which are particularly neat and commodious; indeed I have never &s;een any packet al|together &s;o neat. We had a &s;qually thundering night, but I was &s;afe wrap|ped up in the arms of &s;leep until four o'clock this morning.&mdash;The morning's &s;un &s;oon frightened away the &s;ea exhala|tions, which left to our view &s;everal ve&s;|&s;els in the offing. Our ve&s;&s;el had &s;carcely any motion, as the &s;ea was only dimpled by a light breeze, which wafted us gradually towards the Low Dutch coa&s;t in the afternoon; which we &s;aw nothing off until clo&s;e aboard of it; owing to a mi&s;t, and a flat country.</P>
<P>WE &s;ailed along the Zealand coa&s;t upon our right, where windmills, light|hou&s;es,
<PB N="20" REF="023039_0017_0FBB9ECEE361D898">
rows of trees, and di&s;tant &s;pires were continually ri&s;ing to our view. The breeze quickened up, and pu&s;hed us rapidly forward to the pier of Helvoet|&s;luys, where we doubled bri&s;kly round, and in an in&s;tant entered between two long piers &s;tretching out in the harbour, with the town directly before us. The piers were both lined with curious &s;pecta|tors.&mdash;The fir&s;t object that fixed my at|tention, was a &s;moking Dutchman, which marked the characteri&s;tick of the nation &s;o far. In this moment I felt &s;uch a &s;pirit of univer&s;al philanthropy po&s;&s;e&s;s my &s;oul, that I could mo&s;t cordially have given him a friendly &s;hake of brotherly love; this convinced me, how much our happine&s;s in this world depends on tho&s;e &s;ocial bonds which ought to link us all together.</P>
<P>TO return&mdash;The pier is built of &s;trong piles of timber one hundred and forty
<PB N="21" REF="023039_0018_0FBB9ED0A29272D8">
feet in length, and &s;unk thirty feet in the mud; an immen&s;e work indeed, which &s;eems to bid defiance to the impetuo&s;ity of the waves. We found &s;everal &s;hips in the harbour, and the quay and &s;treets well paved with &s;mall Dutch clinkers, or bricks, as hard as &s;tone, and placed edge|ways. In the ba&s;on above the town, we al&s;o &s;aw &s;everal men of war, and &s;ome &s;keletons, &s;aid to be the remains of the &s;hips commanded by the famous Van Tromp, when he defeated the Engli&s;h. Helvoet&s;luys is &s;ituated upon the we&s;t &s;ide of the I&s;le of Voorn in the Province of Holland. It is &s;mall, but well for|tified, and neat in the extreme, as the clinkers are wa&s;hed as clean as hounds teeth.</P>
<P>IN truth, the hou&s;es, dre&s;s, and every thing around us, wore the face of that neatne&s;s &s;o peculiar to this &s;ingular na|tion and country. The &s;udden change
<PB N="22" REF="023039_0019_0FBB9ED2FB452438">
of every object, had &s;uch an effect on me, the fir&s;t moment we entered this town, that I was almo&s;t inclined to imagine my&s;elf let off in an air balloon, or lo&s;t in the moon, or &s;ome other region to|tally new and &s;trange. We examined carefully every object worth notice, and and were much amu&s;ed with the &s;ingu|larity of the hou&s;es, many of which are built in the old Spani&s;h manner; &s;o that the attick &s;tory is quite lo&s;t in a narrow peek. The men and women in the vulgar cla&s;s, are quite boori&s;h and inanimate, and appear characteri&s;tick with their &s;hips&mdash;heavy and <HI>&s;quare.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>THE women are &s;ingularly dre&s;&s;ed; we have not yet &s;een a &s;ingle head elevated beyond the bounds nature has pre&s;cribed; but they are all tru&s;&s;ed up with caps as tight as their &s;kins; add to this, com|mon bra&s;s ear rings of an enormous &s;ize; and as a proof of their ta&s;te, what
<PB N="23" REF="023039_0020_0FBB9ED44C228D58">
&s;hould you think of black beauty &s;pots over their temples, as big as a crown, and as ragged as if torn from the &s;ilk?</P>
<P>I AM quite in raptures with the neat|ne&s;s which dazzles our eyes on all &s;ides; but as my head is not yet totally free from the dizzine&s;s of our &s;ea pa&s;&s;age, I &s;hall not venture any farther to night; but will re&s;erve my other ob&s;ervations for future letters, which you may regu|larly expect from po&s;t to po&s;t, until I have nothing new to &s;ay, or otherwi&s;e until my return to England.</P>
<P>WE have now in company a young Oxonian, ju&s;t <HI>fledged,</HI> and for the fir&s;t time adrift in the wide world, upon the <HI>grand tour</HI>: I left him an hour &s;ince, indu&s;triou&s;|ly engaged in writing his journal in a back room, with his travelling de&s;k, and a va|riety of in&s;truments paraded before him&mdash; Were I a Dutchman, I &s;hould have &s;u&s;|pected
<PB N="24" REF="023039_0021_0FBB9ED602DAF8E8">
him for a &s;py, and &s;tealing a plan of the fortifications: But how unju&s;t my &s;u&s;picions would have been! for I peeped &s;lyly over his &s;houlder, and found him innocently engaged in drawing a Dutch wench &s;crubbing the pavements&mdash;as the fir&s;t &s;pecimen of his genius and &s;agacity&mdash; if father Sterne had been in my place he would certainly have ranked him in the cla&s;s of "&s;imple travellers."&mdash;It is a chance if your eyes are not fatigued by this time; I am &s;ure my fingers are, &s;o I &s;hall leave you abruptly, as I feel my&s;elf entirely di&s;po&s;ed to try the good qualities of a Dutch bed.</P>
<P>MY compliments wait on your ami|able family, and believe me very re&s;pect|fully,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your devoted humble Servant, &mdash; &mdash;.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I PROMISED to continue my ob&s;ervations, but &s;o many new objects have crowded upon me &s;ince my la&s;t, that I am really at a lo&s;s where to &s;eize the chain, &s;o as to run along from link to link, in &s;ome regular order to the end of the &s;heet.</P>
<P>WE left Helvoet&s;luys ye&s;terday morn|ing, at &s;even o'clock, in a villanous coach drawn by two hor&s;es acro&s;s the I&s;land of Voorn, to the plea&s;ant town of Brill, &s;ituated on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the I&s;land.
<PB N="26" REF="023039_0023_0FBB9EDD9E0E07E0">
We found the roads muddy and di&s;a|greeable, and nothing which merits par|ticular notice in the country, except that their cows horns are &s;horter than tho&s;e in England&mdash;the &s;heep have none at all &mdash;and if we can judge from the appear|ance of the women, the hu&s;bands are in no <HI>great danger</HI> of wearing horns any more than the &s;heep&mdash;at lea&s;t not longer than the cows.</P>
<P>WE ob&s;erved upon almo&s;t every church, as well as in the very heart of the Brill, enormous great &s;torks ne&s;ts&mdash;the&s;e birds enjoy the patronage and protection of the States, we are told, from &s;ome re|ligious prejudice&mdash;and from a notion that they are partial to Republicks. Swans are called imperial birds, as none but the nobility can keep them.</P>
<P>SEVEN miles travelling brought us to the Brill; however, I will &s;ay nothing
<PB N="27" REF="023039_0024_0FBB9EDEAA645F08">
of this &s;nug town, until I have told you how we were fleeced by the porters be|fore we &s;et off; and what is wor&s;e, they are countenanced by the police: The truth is, we could not prevail on our lubberly, &s;moking mule of a driver, to bring his coach to our door to receive our baggage, though in the &s;ame &s;treet, and only half a dozen doors di&s;tant; but we mu&s;t employ porters. After much puzzle about nothing, we put all our baggage into one waggon, and mounted &s;ix of us in another, and jogged away through the mud. It is very curious to &s;ee how the&s;e fellows &s;teer their fore wheels with their feet. In approaching Brill, we pa&s;&s;ed under a double grove of beautiful trees, a long draw bridge, lead|ing over a wide fo&s;&s;e; and then entered through the gates, and aver&s;ed the be&s;t part of the city; while the &s;kippers were &s;ettling by the dice, which &s;hould
<PB N="28" REF="023039_0025_0FBB9EE0279B30D0">
take us up to Rotterdam. This place is celebrated in hi&s;tory for giving birth to the Republick. It was here the male-contents planted their &s;tandard under the Earl of March, in 1572, from on board &s;ome privateers (two hundred and three years before the Lexington battle, which al&s;o gave birth to the American Republick) and in &s;pite of every effort made by the bloody Duke d'Alva, (who was then pro&s;ecuting the horrid inqui&s;i|tion with barbarous rigour) they held po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The &s;parks of a revolt were thickly &s;cattered, and only waited a fa|vourable breeze to blow up the flame, &s;preading in an in&s;tant throughout the &s;eventeen Provinces, which were &s;oon after &s;upported by the great Prince Wil|liam the fir&s;t, at this time levying forces in Germany, to re&s;cue his country from the cruel hands of their biggoted, Span|i&s;h per&s;ecutors.</P>

<P>THE &s;treets are &s;pacious, and all plant|ed with trees upon each &s;ide of the canals, which run along in the middle: The verdure of the trees reflecting &s;trongly upon large windows which are kept bright and free from du&s;t, add infinitely to their lu&s;tre and magnificence.</P>
<P>IT had an odd appearance to us, to &s;ee reflecting gla&s;&s;es hitched upon the out&s;ide of the mo&s;t genteel windows, &s;o that Mad|am

(Mavrow) can &s;et unob&s;erved by her window and reconnoitre at her ea&s;e every object pa&s;&s;ing up and down the &s;treets.</P>
<P>IN this town it &s;eemed as if the on|ly or chief bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;crubbing and &s;couring on all &s;ides. The church is a hand&s;ome &s;tructure, the &s;teeple of which is the &s;ailors land mark. Ships &s;ailing up the Maes to Rotterdam, pa&s;s clo&s;e under the ramparts of this city, upon which are plea&s;ant walks under groves of trees.</P>
<P>THE i&s;le of Voorn, of which Brill is the capital, is about twenty miles in length, and &s;ix in breadth; the &s;oil ap|peared to us light, but fruitful in grain.</P>
<P>UPON our return, we found our ve&s;&s;el ready to &s;et &s;ail, and with a fine fre&s;h gale at N. W. we immediately entered the
<PB N="31" REF="023039_0028_0FBB9EE89D208718">
Maes, and &s;tood away directly before it for Rotterdam.</P>
<P>THE river is one mile and a half broad oppo&s;ite to Brill; but in general a mile.</P>
<P>UPON the borders, are many groves, as well as rows of trees, and &s;everal villag|es; particularly Delfthaven, two miles from Rotterdam, and rendered famous for having produced the gallant Van Tromp&mdash;the pride of Holland; who, notwith&s;tanding his per&s;evering valour, never &s;ucceeded to any decided effect. This village is &s;trongly fortified, and de|fended again&s;t inundations by dams. We &s;aw three men of war, and &s;everal &s;hips in the harbour as we pa&s;&s;ed. The willow trees along the margin of the river ap|peared afloat in the water at a little di&s;|tance; indeed the country is &s;o flat and low, that we had nothing in our way but trees to intercept our view, which we
<PB N="32" REF="023039_0029_0FBB9EEA3B409FF8">
overlooked mo&s;tly from our deck. The meadows and pa&s;ture lands afford fine feeding for cattle, who &s;tand up to their eyes in rich clover. The &s;kip|per told us that the water is from four to five fathoms deep in many parts of the river; but no ve&s;&s;el exceeding nine or ten feet attempts to come up the Maes by Brill, and that the heavy &s;hips go round by Helvoet&s;luys and Dordrecht.</P>
<P>IN the neighbourhood of Rotterdam, we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal groves of trees upon our right; and then &s;ailed along parallel with the bomb quay, half a mile, where we &s;aw a lovely line of trees clo&s;ely knit together, which <HI>half</HI> deprived us of the &s;ight of the mo&s;t magnificent hou&s;es I can recollect to have &s;een any where. The old &s;kipper told us, that the walks under the&s;e trees were truly elegant, and much frequented by the <HI>beau

monde</HI>&mdash;we found them broad, with di&s;|tinct walks finely &s;haded.</P>
<P>WE penetrated with our eyes into the heart of this beautiful city, through two or three avenues as we pa&s;&s;ed; which &s;hewed us &s;uch a &s;ingular confu&s;ion of ma&s;ts, &s;pires, trees, canals, and hou&s;es, all jumbled together, as led me almo&s;t to think that nature and art had planned this enchanting compound in a whim&s;i|cal moment.</P>
<P>ROTTERDAM is the &s;econd grand em|porium of the Republick&mdash;the harbour is &s;afe from naval enemies, but inconve|nient of acce&s;s, on account of its di&s;tance from the &s;ea.</P>
<P>THE port is rendered particularly commodious, by large canals, which ad|mit &s;hips of upwards of three hundred
<PB N="34" REF="023039_0031_0FBB9EECFB15D6D8">
tons burden, quite up to the merchants doors in every part of the city.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to the bomb quay the great|e&s;t part of the &s;hipping are moored, which has a noble effect, much enlivened by the motion of &s;hips and boats &s;ailing up and down the river.</P>
<P>THE town is very populous, and built in a triangular form; the hou&s;es mo&s;t|ly very large and elegant, made of flat ground brick, neatly pointed with white &s;eams&mdash;and the &s;treets are &s;pacious and well paved by the &s;ides of the canals.</P>
<P>TO avoid a repetition on this head, I will endeavour to give you a general idea at once of the principal cities in Holland. Imagine your&s;elf traver&s;ing one of the&s;e cities, and every other mo|ment upon a neat draw bridge (built with hewn &s;tone and iron railings) lead|ing
<PB N="35" REF="023039_0032_0FBB9EEE81885968">
over a canal running through a &s;pa|cious &s;treet, with a continual commo|tion of boats and barges upon each &s;ide &mdash;a clean paved wide &s;treet before you, and beautiful hou&s;es, with trees border|ing the canals. Hold fa&s;t to the&s;e grand outlines, and &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elf immerged in a crowd of indu&s;trious mortals, all in pur&s;uit of wealth, and you can ea&s;ily trace, by your fire &s;ide, mo&s;t of the towns in the Seven Provinces.</P>
<P>I MUST not forget to tell you, that we walked in a plea&s;ant grove ju&s;t with|out the gates, where we &s;aw many of the gentry upon the wing for their coun|try &s;eats, with good black hor&s;es, and clum&s;y carriages&mdash;&s;ome of them capri|ciou&s;ly made in form of triumphant cars &mdash;The Dutch gentlemen &s;eldom ride on hor&s;eback, and never without being ex|po&s;ed to the ridicule of the rabble at &s;uch an uncommon &s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="023039_0033_0FBB9EEFE8B98D68">WE were often puzzled in the &s;treets for an interpreter, but &s;eldom failed in addre&s;&s;ing our&s;elves in French to any people of genteel appearance. It is re|ally a&s;toni&s;hing how generally this lan|guage is now &s;poken throughout Eu|rope. Indeed it is almo&s;t vulgar for a man to &s;peak his native tongue with the <HI>beau monde</HI>&mdash;and a knowledge of the French is an indi&s;pen&s;able criterion of an accompli&s;hed gentleman; for a foreigner is always addre&s;&s;ed in this popular and charming language.</P>
<P>SINCE I am upon the &s;ubject of lan|guages, a few words in defence of the Dutch will not be improper. Every one knows it is in truth vulgar and har&s;h; but perhaps no two languages bear a greater affinity to each other than the Dutch and the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="023039_0034_0FBB9EF1A63CB628">WHEN I fir&s;t arrived in France, it was &s;ome weeks before I could under&s;tand a collected French phra&s;e; but the mo|ment I landed in Holland, I heard entire Engli&s;h phra&s;es, or rather &s;uch as the Engli&s;h borrowed from the Dutch; for it is well known, that the Dutch is an original language, and the Engli&s;h, on the contrary, a compounded one; be&s;ides, in examining a Dutch letter, I found it contained &s;o many Engli&s;h words and phra&s;es, that I had no difficulty to un|der&s;tand the greate&s;t part of it.

<P>WE &s;aw near the market place the &s;tat|ue of the famous Era&s;mus, who was born here; and viewed St. Lawrence, the principal Church&mdash;where we a&s;cended a lofty tower, from whence we command|ed a delightful picture&s;que <HI>coup d'oeil.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="023039_0035_0FBB9EF53784EBD0">THE city of Rotterdam appeared like a high fini&s;hed curious picture below us; and the country beyond, a delightful back ground, cultivated like a continued garden, all the way to our horizon.</P>

<P>IN ranging over this extended pro&s;|pect, we encompa&s;&s;ed within our view, through &s;pygla&s;&s;es, Delft, Dort, Hague, Brill, Utrecht, and Am&s;terdam; which in fact included the be&s;t part of Hol|land.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT it beyond the power of the mo&s;t fertile conception to imagine a more lovely &s;ight; but I found this large picture much improved by reduc|ing

<OPENER><DATELINE>ROTTERDAM, <DATE>30th May, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL nature &s;eems to &s;mile this delightful morn.</P>
<P>WE have ju&s;t made a little excur&s;ion into the country, roving carele&s;sly a|mong the yellow bo&s;omed meadows, the fragrancy of which was a luxury I wi&s;h to participate in common with my friends.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall go on glutting our greedy eyes until the afternoon, when we intend pur&s;uing our travels on to the Hague.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="023039_0038_0FBB9EFB32178838">I MUST not, however, leave Rotter|dam without making my obei&s;ance to our thirteen American &s;tripes, which are flying among the &s;hipping. You know I am particularly partial to them. Not|with&s;tanding their youth, they are for|ward in introducing them&s;elves into the company of old European &s;treamers, which have been waving on the ocean until they begin to fade with age: But the <HI>Stripes</HI> &s;hine with the lu&s;tre of a rainbow, after a thunder &s;torm&mdash;which, happily for mankind, is blown over&mdash; and has left the world in a dead calm.</P>
<P>IN addition to the American &s;hips in this harbour, we &s;aw &s;everal large Dutch|men, freighted to carry over to America upwards of one thou&s;and emigrants.</P>
<P>WHAT a fea&s;t for the &s;oul, when we reflect that the pre&s;ent age in America has, by a virtuous and arduous &s;truggle,
<PB N="42" REF="023039_0039_0FBB9EFCCB2F1920">
opened an a&s;ylum to the oppre&s;&s;ed na|tions of the earth: This con&s;ideration alone (when we reflect on its extended effects, and probable duration) is worth all the dangers and toils we have en|dured in the conflict.</P>
<P>SINCE the world fir&s;t exi&s;ted, no peo|ple ever had a more &s;olemn, and import|ant charge committed to their hands; as the welfare of millions, for ages to come, re&s;ts on the per&s;evering virtue of the pre&s;ent generation.</P>
<P>AMERICA &s;tands comparatively like the &s;un in the heavens&mdash;the centre of light, and the wonder of the admiring world, who feel the influence of its rays.</P>
<P>THE per&s;ecuted will find ea&s;e and re&s;t; and tortured virtue and exiled worth will take refuge among us, from every quar|ter of this old world.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="023039_0040_0FBB9F0280D54990">MILD laws, executed with energy, will &s;ecure us happine&s;s, and bid a&s;toni&s;hed probity defy its tyrant.</P>
<P>I PRAY God, that this infant fabrick may never be &s;hattered by the cla&s;hing intere&s;ts of the different States; and that they may continue their glorious career, and nobly &s;acrifice partial views to the general good of the common empire.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;omething &s;o exceedingly mu&s;ical in the Dutch chimes, that I oft|en &s;top in the middle of a &s;treet to li&s;ten to their &s;hrill &s;ounds: The bells hang, in great numbers, in niches round the towers of the churches.</P>
<P>IN the church of St. Lawrence we &s;aw a grave, where bones, and &s;ome old Dutch &s;kulls were &s;ticking out at the &s;ides, ap|parently eager once more to catch the light: The old Sexton was bu&s;ily em|ployed
<PB N="44" REF="023039_0041_0FBB9F051446D390">
in collecting the bones, and pack|ing them up in &s;eparate boxes, of about three feet &s;quare, to be reinterred in this compact way, which I find is a cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>OUR Oxonian companion took off a curious Latin Epitaph from a monu|ment, of which he gave me this tran&s;la|tion in Engli&s;h:</P>
<P>JOHN BRAAKEL, THE TERROUR OF THE SEA, TO WHOM FIRE, EARTH, AND WATER SUBMITTED, IS COVERED WITH THIS STONE. HIS SPIRIT EVEN NOW SEEMS READY TO BURST INTO FLAME, AND TO BREAK FROM ITS EARTHLY HABITATION, AS HE BROKE THE CHAINS OF IRON.</P>
<P>I WAS much plea&s;ed with the&s;e bold thoughts; and upon examining the hi&s;|tory
<PB N="45" REF="023039_0042_0FBB9F0661701AB8">
of the United Provinces, I find Braa|kel was a Dutch Admiral from Haerlem, who di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in a memora|ble exploit in the holy war, in 1245.</P>
<P>WHEN the combined armies arrived in Egypt, the pa&s;&s;age of the Nile was inter|cepted by an extraordinary iron chain, which Braakel found means to break, by the aid of enormous iron &s;aws fixed on the &s;tern of three of his &s;hips; the in|vention &s;ucceeded, and Damietta was in con&s;equence taken: The idea was &s;ug|ge&s;ted by a Haerlem boy, &s;ince which the city arms are, a &s;word between four &s;tars, and a cro&s;s over the point, with this motto: "VALOUR OVERCOMES POWER."</P>
<P>AS an American, I feel my&s;elf deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;uperior dignity of my country. Not from its pre&s;ent wealth or
<PB N="46" REF="023039_0043_0FBB9F07E67E2810">
numbers, nor from tho&s;e &s;elfi&s;h and nar|row principles which lead mo&s;t Engli&s;h|men to view them&s;elves and their coun|try &s;uperior to the re&s;t of the world; but from the happy &s;ituation of America&mdash; its natural advantages&mdash;and indulging in the copious field of anticipation.</P>
<P>IN February, 1778, I found my&s;elf in the &s;outh part of Georgia, and the trees in full bloom, with every plea&s;ing a&s;pect of &s;pring.</P>
<P>FROM February to May, I continued edging northerly as far as the borders of Newhamp&s;hire, carrying with me for upwards of 1200 miles the &s;ame climate and fragrancy.</P>
<P>IN this tour, I cro&s;&s;ed eighteen noble rivers, and travelled over every &s;pecies of &s;oil, ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a diver&s;ity of cli|mates
<PB N="47" REF="023039_0044_0FBB9F0962A35328">
as to render it &s;u&s;ceptible of all the productions the earth affords.</P>
<P>ENGLAND, France, and many other parts of Europe, after a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, for &s;ome thou&s;and years, have at length arrived to the highe&s;t &s;tage of im|provements both in agriculture and the arts: Two centuries however have hard|ly elap&s;ed &s;ince America was a mere haunt for &s;avages, and for animals; and yet we find her already advanced to the intermediate &s;tage between a &s;tate of wild nature and the improved &s;tate of Europe.</P>
<P>HOLLAND is a perfect garden; but a continued &s;amene&s;s pre&s;ents no new ob|ject for the imagination to re&s;t upon.</P>
<P>ENGLAND and France are more diver|&s;ified and romantick, and in general richly cultivated&mdash;here and there an ar|tificial fore&s;t&mdash;venerable ca&s;tles&mdash;maje&s;|tick

country &s;eats&mdash;large populous in land cities&mdash;charming roads; and many other intere&s;ting objects, to engage the partic|ular attention of an American: But when we leave the&s;e objects, the effects of art, and enter upon the broad &s;cale of nature, we &s;hall find her in miniature on this &s;ide of the Atlantick, in compari&s;on to the va&s;t lakes and rivers, bold har|bours, maje&s;tick trees, and mountains of America, where the face of the country is plea&s;ingly chequered with high culti|vation, and nature in its bold and orig|inal &s;tate.</P>
<P>VIEWING America from its fir&s;t di&s;|covery to the pre&s;ent period, and then carrying our ideas forward one hundred years, we may &s;afely pre&s;ume upon as many millions of inhabitants, all cir|cum&s;tances con&s;idered; with wealth and improvements in proportion.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="023039_0046_0FBB9F10264E2AE8">SINCE no rea&s;on therefore can be a&s;|&s;igned why America will not continue its career with the &s;ame wonderful progre&s;s for the next hundred years, an Amer|ican may ju&s;tly glory in his country, without falling under the imputation of national prejudice.</P>
<P>FRANCE may boa&s;t of her Loire, and England of her Thames; but how many &s;uch and &s;uperior rivers may not an A|merican boa&s;t of?

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HERE we go! in a floating hou&s;e &s;ixty feet long and &s;ix wide.</P>
<P>I AM now &s;eated in what is called the roof or cabin, which is very agreeable, being calculated to hold conveniently eight or ten per&s;ons, who can &s;ecure it to them&s;elves by paying a &s;mall matter extra. This cabin has a table in the middle, two &s;a&s;h windows, and a bench with velvet cu&s;hions on each &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="023039_0049_0FBB9F14A8CD5BB8">THE re&s;t of the boat is covered with a flat roof, &s;trewed over with &s;mall &s;hells cemented in tar, upon which pa&s;&s;engers may walk with perfect &s;afety: Under the platform, or roof, the common pa&s;&s;engers are &s;eated; twenty eight is the full com|plement, as &s;tipulated by the police.</P>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t been upon deck, and wi&s;h now to introduce you into our compa|ny by as conci&s;e a de&s;cription of the country, and manner of travelling, as my pen will allow me to give you.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, we jumped on board ju&s;t without the gates of Rotterdam, and were then put in motion, by a &s;ingle hor&s;e, trotting along upon the edge of the canal, with thirty of us in tow. In this manner they travel three miles an hour. In this progre&s;s they are &s;o exact, that the Dutch manner of computing di&s;tan|ces from place to place, is by hours in|&s;tead of miles.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="023039_0050_0FBB9F165757F3C0">LOTH to lo&s;e a &s;ingle object, we parad|ed upon the top of the hou&s;e, with a crowded room under us, and clouds of tobacco &s;moke i&s;&s;uing out from little win|dows on each &s;ide&mdash;with a full view of the country all around&mdash;being entirely flat and no ob&s;tacle to impede the &s;ight. In this manner we are now travelling:&mdash; But I am &s;ure you will not forgive me to leave you on the top of the boat, and &s;ay nothing of the country, and a plea&s;|ing variety be&s;ides.</P>
<P>ON one &s;ide of the canal, near Rotter|dam, we pa&s;&s;ed a plea&s;ant row of trees, alive with carriages and people, as well as the canal with the&s;e cloudy boats full of pa&s;&s;engers, and loaded lighters.</P>
<P>YOU will naturally &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch a perpetual movement, with a chain of draw bridges, leading over the canals, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce confu&s;ion.&mdash;

<HI>Point du tout!</HI> You would be &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee with what dexterity, they avoid each other, and pa&s;s under the bridges. All boats going one way are obliged to drop the rope by which they are dragged until the others pa&s;s. Thus the progre&s;s of neither is retarded.</P>
<P>THE &s;ea&s;on is all in our favour, and nature in full dre&s;s. The weather as fine as we could wi&s;h, and our pro&s;pect on all &s;ides animated by a charming variety.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t know that mo&s;t of the gen|teel people re&s;ide the be&s;t part of the &s;ummer at their country hou&s;es; many of which are &s;uperb to a high degree; the others are very neat, and all &s;ituated near the borders of &s;ome canal, with a little plea&s;ant &s;ummer hou&s;e exactly up|on the margin. The&s;e hou&s;es are in a manner <HI>all windows,</HI> and many <HI>&aacute; la Chi|noi&s;e</HI>&mdash;the gardens are mere pictures&mdash;

the Dutch however &s;eem too much at|tached to a profu&s;ion of evergreens, and box; many of their plea&s;ure hou&s;es are covered with them, and we often &s;ee them formed into grottos, arches, and a variety of plea&s;ing and whim&s;ical forms.</P>
<P>THE fragrancy of the meadows and flower gardens, heightens exceedingly this agreeable manner of travelling in Hol|land, in a fine &s;ummer's day, which we now enjoy; and from the top of our floating hou&s;e we have a fair peep into their plea&s;ure hou&s;es; where we &s;ee the happy citizens, regaling them&s;elves in parties, drinking tea, &s;moking, playing cards, hearing mu&s;ick, or reading occa|&s;ionally.

<P>I AM now to give you an ac|count of occurrences &s;ince I left you in a tobacco cloud, on the Delft canal.</P>
<P>I AM always fond of mixing with peo|ple in every &s;ituation, when I am trav|elling; otherwi&s;e we might as well &s;tay at home. The only true way to &s;tudy the human pa&s;&s;ions, and the grand &s;pring which actuates the bulk of mankind, is to analyze them in various po&s;itions; and by a di&s;po&s;ition to be affable, every one may ea&s;ily induce a conver&s;ation:&mdash;
<PB N="58" REF="023039_0055_0FBB9F20A8677D98">
If he gain nothing by the bargain, it is his own fault if he lo&s;e.</P>
<P>IN this frame of mind, I crawled into the body of the boat, and fortunately filled a vacant &s;eat by the &s;ide of a <HI>belle Bruxellois tout &aacute; faite &agrave; la Fran&ccedil;ois,</HI> with her Mon&s;ieur upon her left.&mdash;I found no difficulty to introduce a <HI>badinage</HI> the fir&s;t moment I was &s;eated; and in the next, with all the wanton a&s;&s;urance of a Newenglandman, to a&s;k her, from whence &s;he came? where &s;he re&s;ided? and if the gentleman by her &s;ide was her hu&s;band, gallant, or brother? She, with all the good nature of a true Frenchwoman, as readily gratified my curio&s;ity. By the time we drew near Delft, our acquaint|ance was refined into the true &s;tyle of <HI>&s;ans &s;ouce,</HI> and it &s;eemed to me as if it was of a month's &s;tanding at lea&s;t&mdash;how, or by what &s;ingular agency it happened, I know not; but our hands were &s;oon locked in
<PB N="59" REF="023039_0056_0FBB9F23128E07D0">
one&mdash;and I began to conceit that I felt my&s;elf &s;en&s;ibly intere&s;ted in her happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>HER hu&s;band was bu&s;ily engaged in reading, and gave him&s;elf no anxiety about us.&mdash;Cu&s;tom has in France e&s;tab|li&s;hed a certain <HI>innocent</HI> ladies' language &mdash;which in England would be con&s;trued into a decided intrigue.</P>
<P>IN leaving the truk&s;chute at Delft, Mon&s;ieur politely re&s;igned up Madame to my care, and trudged on before&mdash; We linked arms, and trod over the pave|ments as lightly as a young couple on the full march to the &s;hrine of Hymen&mdash; Every moment in this cri&s;is of our ap|proaching &s;eparation, mutually intere&s;ted us in each other's welfare&mdash;and while we were walking the &s;treets of Delft, Mad|ame &s;lipt her addre&s;s at Rotterdam into my hand&mdash;where I pledged my&s;elf to
<PB N="60" REF="023039_0057_0FBB9F247AF381C8">
pay her my re&s;pects on my return from Am&s;terdam.&mdash;By this time we came up to the hou&s;e of her de&s;tination&mdash;and I thought I could read more meaning in her brilliant black eyes in the final adieu! than in all &s;he had &s;aid&mdash;thus we part|ed. She made a transfer of her polite|ne&s;s to Mon&s;ieur; with him I rejoined my comrades, and then viewed every thing of note in this large city.</P>
<P>DELFT is a plea&s;ant and elegant place, &s;ituated thirty one miles &s;outh we&s;t from Am&s;terdam, in the province of Holland, containing about five thou&s;and hou&s;es and twenty thou&s;and inhabitants. It is of an oblong figure, and well defended from enemies and the &s;ea, by an old wall and three dams. The inhabitants are principally people who have retired upon their fortunes. The &s;treets are con&s;e|quently exceedingly neat, and free from the noi&s;e and bu&s;tle of trade.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="023039_0058_0FBB9F278EBF3CF0">THE &s;tadthou&s;e is a hand&s;ome old Gothick &s;tructure, in which are many good paintings; but the one that mo&s;t merits attention, is that which repre&s;ents the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of William I, prince of Orange, which is affectingly tragick, and finely executed. We next vi&s;ited the old palace, where this great man re&s;ided at the time of this fatal cata&s;trophe, which was perpetrated by Baltha&s;ar Gerard, who was fir&s;t in&s;tigated by a monk, in con&s;equence of a bounty the brutality of Philip II led him to offer in a publick edict for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THEY &s;hewed us the &s;pot where he fell at the foot of the &s;tairs, and two holes which the balls made in the wall after having gone through the prince's head. On the wall is a Dutch in&s;cription.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in de&s;ired to &s;peak with the prince in private, ju&s;t as he ro&s;e from
<PB N="62" REF="023039_0059_0FBB9F2A29B35AA0">
table, and plunged him&s;elf into a ditch, after having executed his bloody de&s;ign; but was immediately taken, and rolled naked in a ca&s;k, driven full of &s;harp nails, until he expired.</P>
<P>THE old and new churches are capi|tal buildings; each adorned with lofty &s;teeples, and uncommonly harmonious chimes, which quite delighted us as we were entering the latter, a &s;tupendous pile, where the a&s;hes of the immortal prince of Orange, already mentioned, re&s;t in peace. In contemplating this magnifick tomb, I cannot expre&s;s what I felt in recollecting the &s;eries of hard and vir|tuous &s;truggles in which he contended, to &s;tem again&s;t the per&s;evering barbarity of the duke of Alva. Recapitulating in my mind the variety of his conflicts&mdash; his fatal end&mdash;and the &s;triking &s;imilarity of his and our great <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI>'s charac|ters, my enthu&s;ia&s;m betrayed me into an
<PB N="63" REF="023039_0060_0FBB9F2B2946D560">
involuntary &s;igh of homage, accompanied by a tear, which I detected &s;tealing &s;lyly down my cheek. Indeed their fame, and the importance of their atchievements are &s;uch, in the &s;cale of human events, that their names de&s;erve to be written by the rays of the &s;un on the &s;urface of the HEAVENS.</P>
<P>THE prince's &s;tatue in marble, lies upon the top of the tomb, with his fa|vourite dog at his feet, who, according to tradition, died with grief, immediate|ly after his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>THE tomb lies under the repre&s;enta|tion of heaven, which is &s;upported by twenty two black marble columns, upon the top of which &s;tands Fame with her trumpet &s;ounding over him, and this motto&mdash;<HI>"te vindico tutor libertas."</HI> Be|&s;ides the &s;tatue on the tomb, there is an|other
<PB N="64" REF="023039_0061_0FBB9F2D62B92518">
in bra&s;s, full length, and many other ornaments in bra&s;s and marble.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucceeding princes of Orange are all interred in this church.</P>
<P>IN the old church we &s;aw the monu|ments of the admirals Peter Heine, Van Tromp, and the famous Luwenhock the phy&s;ician. The ar&s;enal, we are told, is the large&s;t in the republick, and worthy a traveller's in&s;pection&mdash;but our time de|nied us the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing it.</P>
<P>DELFT is celebrated for its earthen ware, and formerly &s;ucceeded in a fine imitation of porcelain, which are both on the decline.</P>
<P>THE &s;treets are very broad, two of which are a mile in extent, and the fronts of many hou&s;es are paved with black and white marble.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="023039_0062_0FBB9F2EF272C3B0">THE ringing of the &s;even o'clock bell hurried us on board of our truk&s;chute, upon a full canter through the &s;treets; where we &s;ecured the roof all to our|&s;elves; but did not arrive in this &s;uperb city until late in the evening, which was &s;erene; but the thick exhalations from the canal prevented the moon from &s;hew|ing us the country: Her pale beams quivered lightly upon the water, but too dimly to enable us to di&s;tingui&s;h objects; however, the lights from the &s;ummer hou&s;es compen&s;ated in &s;ome de|gree.</P>
<P>THE dampne&s;s of the evening air, &s;o pernicious in Holland, obliged us to box up in our cabin; but we &s;aw the coun|try near the canal from our cabin win|dows, as we pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>WE had a merry evening, but the &s;tench of the canal was intolerable as
<PB N="66" REF="023039_0063_0FBB9F3070E10FC0">
we approached the Hague, which not a little &s;urpri&s;ed us.</P>
<P>WE were puzzled in the &s;treets to find our h&ocirc;tel, but were &s;oon relieved by a genius watching his opportuni|ty for new comers; he threw out his bait, which my unguarded fellow trav|ellers (who were green in the ways of the world) eagerly catched at&mdash;but as my experience in the broad world had taught me their manoeuvres, I only &s;uf|fered him to &s;hew us the &s;treet, and then, with the be&s;t grace in my power, wi&s;hed him a <HI>decided</HI> good night.</P>
<P>WE took lodgings at l' h&ocirc;tel of Eng|li&s;h parliament, an excellent hou&s;e, where they &s;peak French and Engli&s;h, and have the be&s;t attendance.</P>
<P>A PROPOS, I omitted to mention to you, that the great and wi&s;e Grotius was
<PB N="67" REF="023039_0064_0FBB9F3442B227B0">
buried in the new church, near the prince; this unfortunate man fell a vic|tim to the ra&s;h re&s;entment of prince Maurice, &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his father Wil|liam I.</P>
<P>FAREWELL.&mdash;I &s;hall go on teazing you till my return,&mdash;Adieu!</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT will be pre&s;umptuous in me to attempt a de&s;cription of this mo&s;t beautiful city, till I have fairly &s;een and examined it: For I find the objects are &s;o important, and the place, in every re&s;pect, &s;o much beyond my conceptions, that I &s;hall be obliged to devote &s;everal pages to this &s;ubject alone; but I will endeavour to be as conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash; Indeed my letters are of &s;uch horrid lengths, that I will try to ha&s;h up my cookery of de&s;cription in future in a more laconick journal &s;tyle, which is
<PB N="69" REF="023039_0066_0FBB9F38A7A4A6B0">
le&s;s formal, and often more intere&s;ting and familiar than a &s;tiff epi&s;tolary one.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="day's events">
<HEAD>Sunday, <HI>June</HI> 4.</HEAD>
<P>I TOOK care to appear in print, e&s;pec|ially as my fir&s;t &s;tep was to pay my re|&s;pects to the American amba&s;&s;ador, John Adams, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> but his ab&s;ence turned my attention to the churches, it being then the height of their devotion.</P>
<P>THE Dutch churches I have &s;een are all dive&s;ted of tho&s;e gaudy ornaments, &s;o common in France and other catho|lick countries: On the contrary, they have a certain melancholy gloom, owing to the walls being covered with the arms of the principal families, worked upon black velvet, and bordered with broad black frames. The&s;e give the appear|ance, or at lea&s;t an idea, of the in&s;ide of large tombs. The Dutch prie&s;ts were
<PB N="70" REF="023039_0067_0FBB9F3A32045A10">
thumping the cu&s;hions to large and crowded audiences, who &s;tood all with their hats on.</P>
<P>FROM the churches I repaired to the grand parade, where the garri&s;on of the Hague was reviewed by the prince of Orange, the two young princes, and a great concour&s;e of nobility and citizens.</P>
<P>THE troops are bold &s;tout fellows, dre&s;&s;ed in blue faced with red. I &s;queez|ed in clo&s;e to the prince, and had a fair chance to contemplate&mdash;the man&mdash;with|out being governed by appearances, which are indeed much again&s;t him. He is of a middling &s;tature, effeminate, with a di&s;agreeable &s;tooping gait; add to which a &s;tupid and inanimate countenance.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;aying thus much of the prince, can I venture to ob&s;erve to an Engli&s;h|man, that we were five in company, and
<PB N="71" REF="023039_0068_0FBB9F3D40BBED60">
were all &s;truck equally with an idea, that there is a &s;trong family re&s;emblance be|tween the prince and the king of Eng|land, who you know are related by the marriage of the prince&s;s Anne, daughter to George II, and mother to the prince?</P>
<P>FROM parade we &s;trolled through the principal &s;quares, and many other parts of this &s;uperb and truly elegant city, which delighted us extremely. Though the magnificent buildings on the bomb quay at Rotterdam far excelled any oth|ers I had then &s;een in Europe&mdash;yet the Hague eclip&s;es and mu&s;t exceed, the mo&s;t brilliant imagination. It is generally al|lowed to be the mo&s;t elegant city in Eu|rope&mdash;perhaps in the world.</P>
<P>AT two o'clock I returned again to the grand h&ocirc;tel belonging to the thir|teen United States of America, lately purcha&s;ed by Mr. Adams, for the re&s;i|dence
<PB N="72" REF="023039_0069_0FBB9F3FF41EBA48">
of our future amba&s;&s;adors. It is decently furni&s;hed, has a large library, and an elegant little garden. I was re|ceived in the mo&s;t cordial manner, din|ed with the amba&s;&s;ador, and in the af|ternoon we took an airing in his car|riage, through the be&s;t part of the city, and then to the plea&s;ant fi&s;hing town of Schewling, two miles from the Hague, upon the borders of the &s;ea. The weath|er being fine, the road and &s;ide walks were full of people, all pu&s;hing forward, on foot and in carriages, to enjoy the &s;ea breeze, and walk on the beach.</P>
<P>THE novelty, and the roaring of the uncouth cook maids, with which the waggons were crowded, exceedingly a|mu&s;ed me; but their &s;inging, or rath|er yelling, was comparatively like the &s;qualling of as many cats, roa&s;ting over a roaring fire: They &s;eemed to vie with each other which &s;hould make the mo&s;t

noi&s;e, but without the lea&s;t harmony or uni&s;on;&mdash;their mouths were frightful|ly di&s;tended&mdash;and their faces ready to bur&s;t with their efforts&mdash;which, added to their &s;ingular dre&s;s, produced a laughable &s;cene.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>THIS &s;cene brought to my mind a very ab&s;urd and awk|ward cu&s;tom, prevalent in America; though on the other extreme. In France every one finds him&s;elf perfectly at ea&s;e with all around him the fir&s;t moment he enters a circle; and conver&s;ation is as animated, and as unre&s;trained in a full company, as among a few &s;elect friends. In England and America, the rever&s;e is the ca&s;e&mdash;let a Frenchman be intro|duced into a large circle at their fir&s;t meeting&mdash;he mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e him&s;elf dropped into a &s;ociety of Quakers. Every one &s;eems at fir&s;t afraid to break &s;ilence, for fear of the critici&s;ms of the re&s;t&mdash;by degrees however the charm is di&s;&s;olved, and it is ten to one if another foreigner &s;hould be u&s;hered in, four hours from the fir&s;t, that he would &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf in Bedlam; this extraordinary rever&s;e comes on progre&s;&s;ively.</P><P>AS &s;oon as the company begin to find them&s;elves at ea&s;e with one another, and their frozen tongues a little unbent; &s;hould a young lady be in the circle, &s;ome gentleman, or perhaps the lady of the hou&s;e, will call on her to &s;ing&mdash;&s;he directly declares "&s;he never &s;ung in her life," though per|haps half the company have been entertained with her &s;ing|ing before&mdash;as this &s;ubterfuge therefore will not avail her, the whole company fall upon her like hungry dogs upon their prey&mdash;then &s;he prote&s;ts&mdash;"&s;he has a bad cold"&mdash;all mouths are again opened&mdash;&s;ing! &s;ing! you mu&s;t &s;ing!&mdash;thus hunted down, after a &s;ew&mdash;hems&mdash;and &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in her bad cold&mdash;the fair &s;yren opens her harmonious throat, and quivers out perhaps a good &s;ong, or perhaps &s;omething like the Dutch waggon girls&mdash;as it may happen!&mdash;and, at any rate, &s;he calls her veracity &s;eriou&s;ly in que&s;tion in face of the whole company.</P><P>HAVING re&s;ided and travelled &s;everal years in mo&s;t parts of France, I will freely confe&s;s my&s;elf &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of their general cu&s;toms, and I ardently hope we &s;hall rub in our American compo&s;ition a &s;ea&s;oning of the French&mdash;<HI>&s;ant &s;ouci</HI> and <HI>vive la bagatelle.</HI> They undoubtedly are the happie&s;t people in Europe, owing to a charming cli|mate, light diet, good wines, vivacity, and living under a de&s;|potick government; which though unfriendly to liberty, and that noble expan&s;ion of the human &s;oul&mdash;yet it has a tenden|cy to check ambition; they glide oh with ea&s;y gales in their pa&s;&s;age through life, if ble&s;&s;ed with a good monarch, and a bad one is their greate&s;t danger.&mdash;One half of the unhappi|ne&s;s of mankind ari&s;es from ambition; and as happine&s;s is the main end of this life, that government which pro|duces the large&s;t &s;hare, is, in my humble e&s;timation, the be&s;t,</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="023039_0071_0FBB9F4359D5D888">THE amba&s;&s;ador's livery is the &s;ame as the American uniform, which is known by all ranks of people, who pay &s;o much re&s;pect to it, that a few more jaunts to Schewling would have put me under the nece&s;&s;ity of buying a new hat.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="023039_0072_0FBB9F44AE236E90">THE road is charming, and entirely &s;haded by a double row of trees, &s;o ex|actly lined that we &s;aw the &s;teeple of the village church from the gates of the city, through an arch formed by the limbs of the trees.</P>
<P>THE north &s;ea opened to our view all at once, at the end of the avenue. Nature has kindly provided a barrier again&s;t the ocean, by the downs which are thrown up along the principal part of the coa&s;t of this low country; which I al&s;o ob|&s;erved on the coa&s;t of the Au&s;trian Neth|erlands, in travelling through that coun|try a few years pa&s;t. But they owe their principal &s;ecurity to the dykes and dams.</P>
<P>I AM told there was in this village, a kind of waggon con&s;tructed by prince Maurice's principal engineer, which they &s;ay would go upon the &s;and along the
<PB N="76" REF="023039_0073_0FBB9F4624C0B8D0">
coa&s;t at the rate of &s;even leagues an hour, by help of fails.</P>
<P>PEOPLE often bathe here in the &s;um|mer; but what is very &s;ingular, I am a&s;|&s;ured that the fi&s;hermen's daughters, not only guard the men's clothes, but wipe them dry with towels as they leave the water; and this with perfect <HI>&s;ang froid</HI>; which plainly proves how far cu&s;tom and habit may reconcile us to any thing.</P>
<P>THE coa&s;t was full of &s;mall fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els. Some we &s;aw at &s;ea.</P>
<P>THE count de Bentinck's famous gar|dens are upon this road, and are well worth &s;eeing. They belonged former|ly to the duke of Portland, who was particularly patronized by William III. They are di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other gardens in the province, by their &s;tyle, &s;implicity, and picture&s;que views; &s;uch
<PB N="77" REF="023039_0074_0FBB9F47A11E5908">
as a fine orangery, a grotto, water &s;pouts, a fore&s;t, terrace walks, hills, flower gar|dens, a lake, and a menage; in &s;hort, the eye is on every &s;ide delighted.</P>
<P>ON our return we pa&s;&s;ed the prince, walking, with a numerous retinue.&mdash; Spent the evening with Mr. Adams, and the famous Mon&s;ieur Dumas, his &s;ecretary, who eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the early part of our con|te&s;t, at the court of France, as well as by gaining us weighty friends in this re|publick.</P>
<P>WITH two gentlemen of &s;uch en|lightened genius and deep erudition, it would have been my own fault not to have &s;ifted out every information I was &s;o eager to obtain relative to this country, and the pre&s;ent convul&s;ed &s;tate of its complicated government.&mdash; I have taken my notes and &s;hall touch

<HEAD>Monday, <HI>June</HI> 5.</HEAD>
<P>BREAKFASTED with Mr. Adams&mdash;af|ter which we vi&s;ited <HI>la Mai&s;on du Bois,</HI> which is &s;ituated about a mile from the Hague, in the centre of the large&s;t nat|ural wood in Holland, and the only one, except the wood near Haerlem.</P>
<P>THIS palace was built by the widow of prince Henry Frederick, for a hou&s;e of mourning. It is an elegant &s;tructure and entirely &s;eque&s;tered from the gay world, being in a manner embo&s;omed in a grove, cut into many romantick walks leading from the palace, which has a large garden behind it. Over the gate we &s;aw the arms of Orange Na&s;&s;au, and entered by a flight of &s;teps.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="023039_0076_0FBB9F4EDC2A9240">THE grand &s;aloon, with its exqui&s;ite paintings, are the principal objects of at|tention, and mo&s;tly executed by tho&s;e great ma&s;ters, Rubens and Van der Worf, repre&s;enting in very large pieces, the brilliant triumphs of Frederick Henry, who fini&s;hed the fabrick of independence for his country, which was founded by his immortal father, and vigorou&s;ly car|ried on by his gallant brother Prince Maurice.</P>
<P>AS I was born with a tincture of a painter's &s;oul, I found in this &s;aloon, a luxurious fea&s;t for the eyes. The widow Amelia in her weeds, is repre&s;ented in the middle of the ceiling of the cupola over the gallery, where the mu&s;icians former|ly played, to &s;ooth her melancholy.</P>
<P>RUBENS' <HI>Vulcan in his &s;hop,</HI> placed very properly near the fire, is e&s;teemed the fin|e&s;t in the collection: But what plea&s;ed
<PB N="80" REF="023039_0077_0FBB9F4FE3E5D990">
me mo&s;t, was the full length portraits of William I, and Prince Maurice; who are al&s;o repre&s;ented in bu&s;ts of mar|ble placed over the chimney.</P>
<P>THE floors are black walnut, covered with rich carpets. In one of the apart|ments we &s;aw a valuable India japanned railing, enclo&s;ing the prince&s;s's bed; which is inlaid with the mother of pearl, and co&s;t twenty eight thou&s;and guilders. In another apartment was &s;hewn us a flow|er piece, the work of a Flemi&s;h ma&s;ter, and valued at fifteen thou&s;and florins. I was &s;o enraptured with the paint|ings, that after a full hour's eager ex|amination, I left them with regret.</P>
<P>MR. Adams then di&s;charged his car|riage, and we walked two hours more about the fore&s;t, which was very plea&s;|ing to me, notwith&s;tanding the road were heavy and &s;andy. The lofty oak
<PB N="81" REF="023039_0078_0FBB9F516DE43AE0">
&s;eemed to be &s;o promi&s;cuou&s;ly thrown together, that it revived in my brea&s;t a lively picture of many &s;uch &s;ituations I had &s;een in the cour&s;e of my tour through the United States of America, &s;ome years &s;ince. Our eyes were delighted with the fine plumage of the birds, who&s;e &s;weet melody reechoed through the woods.</P>
<P>DINED at the American h&ocirc;tel; and in the afternoon we made an excur&s;ion to the neat village of Ry&s;wick, &s;ituated be|tween the Hague and Delft, two miles from the former. The road is well paved, and beautifully adorned by lofty trees and fine meadows on each &s;ide. This village is famous for the peace concluded here in 1697.</P>
<P>THE palace is &s;ituated about a quarter of a mile from the village. It belongs to the prince of Orange, and is nobly built with hewn &s;tone; but going fa&s;t

<P>I SPENT this forenoon in rambling at large in this city; dined again with Mr. A&mdash;, and in the afternoon we took an airing to Delft. We pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal barriers, rode a circumference round the ramparts of that city, and re|turned in the evening along the edge of the canal.

<P>IN popularity and influence at this court, Mr. A&mdash; undoubtedly bears the palm in the diplomatick body. He is univer&s;ally e&s;teemed, for his profound penetration and exten&s;ive political knowl|edge, the fir&s;t character our we&s;tern world has yet produced.</P>
<P>HE talks but little&mdash;thinks a great deal &mdash;and what he &s;ays is always to the pur|po&s;e; and in point of future events, his words &s;eem to be the words of an oracle.

<P>LORD Che&s;terfield declares it to be the mo&s;t elegant city in the world.</P>
<P>IT contains &s;ix thou&s;and hou&s;es and forty five thou&s;and inhabitants, &s;urround|ed by a canal bordered by lofty trees.

<HEAD>WEDNESDAY, <HI>June</HI> 7.</HEAD>
<P>THIS morning at nine o'clock, I left the Hague, on my way to Leyden. We had a &s;trong gale again&s;t us, which did not however &s;en&s;ibly check our progre&s;s.</P>
<P>WE were about three hours perform|ing this trip. The canal, the whole way was very &s;pacious (&s;ay about fifty feet wide) and the water above the level of the country, which added much to the advantage of our pro&s;pect; which was in every re&s;pect equal in feats, &s;ummer hou&s;es, and the face of the country, to that already de&s;cribed between Rotterdam and Delft: But from the continual pa&s;&s;|ing

of truk&s;chutes, and not under&s;tand|ing the abrupt orders of our &s;kipper, I was frequently in danger, on the top of the boat, of getting my legs tripped up by the rope; but this may be ea&s;ily a|voided, by keeping below, which my ea|ger curio&s;ity would by no means li&s;ten to.</P>
<P>I formed an acquaintance with an in|telligible inhabitant of Leyden, who, on our approach to the city, &s;hewed me the ground from whence the Spaniards un|der general Bald&s;ez be&s;ieged this place; as al&s;o the ve&s;tiges of one of their old forts.</P>
<P>I COULD not contemplate the horrors of this cruel &s;ix months &s;iege, without a heart felt &s;ympathy; e&s;pecially when I recollected the tragick picture given of it in Wat&s;on's Phillip.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="023039_0091_0FBB9F6F9BB4F4E0">HE &s;ays&mdash;"When the Spaniards en|deavoured to intimidate them into a &s;ur|render of the town, they nobly an&s;wered &mdash;'that they had maturely weighed their &s;ituation, and were re&s;olved to peri&s;h, with their wives and children, in the flames of the city, kindled by their own hands, or die with hunger, rather than &s;ubmit to the Spaniards'&mdash;the mi&s;ery which only exi&s;ted in imagination, dur|ing the two fir&s;t months of the &s;iege, was at la&s;t fatally realized as they were reduced to the hard nece&s;&s;ity of eating their dogs and hor&s;es."</P>
<P>LEYDEN is &s;ituated &s;ix miles from the &s;ea, and nineteen &s;outh of Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>IN point of &s;ize, it yields only to Am|&s;terdam, and is as neat and plea&s;ant as any town in the republick. It is &s;up|po&s;ed to contain forty thou&s;and &s;ouls,
<PB N="95" REF="023039_0092_0FBB9F70EF8FC800">
which is indeed a &s;mall number in pro|portion to its &s;ize.</P>
<P>THE city is well fortified, with a wide ditch, adorned with rows of trees; the buildings are beautiful, and the &s;treets in general very &s;pacious, and perfectly clean and white, particularly broad &s;treet, which runs quite through the city, from the Hague gate to the Utrecht gate: This &s;treet ri&s;es in the middle, and is finely paved. The others have in general a canal in the middle, adorned as u&s;ual, with &s;tately trees, &s;ome three rows on a &s;ide, which give them the appearance of &s;o many alleys of a beautiful garden.</P>
<P>THE city is built on the old Rhine, which divides it into fifty i&s;lands, of which thirty one may be &s;ailed round in boats. It has one hundred and forty five bridges (built of &s;tone) with iron railings, one hundred and eighty &s;treets, and forty two towers on the walls.</P>

The be&s;t painting is a whim&s;ical repre|&s;entation of the day of judgment, by the famous Luke Leyden, who is &s;aid to be the fir&s;t modern painter who had true ideas of per&s;pective: This painting is certainly the production of the mo&s;t fer|tile imagination; but with what ju&s;t|ne&s;s he has delineated the confu&s;ion of this important and awful day, remains yet to be decided.&mdash;He died in 1533.</P>
<P>THE large&s;t church, is a va&s;t pile, but in other re&s;pects, merits no other partic|ular

notice, than to pay the tribute of homage due to the manes of that great phy&s;ician and philo&s;opher, Boerhaave, who enlightened the world with the flame of his genius; his monument is admired for its elegant &s;implicity.</P>
<P>THE reputation of this great man ex|tended into China: A mandarin wrote to him with this in&s;cription&mdash;<HI>"To</HI> BOER|HAAVE <HI>in Europe</HI>;"&mdash;and the letter came regularly to him.</P>
<P>THE city of Leyden have rai&s;ed a mon|ument in the church of St. Peter to the &s;alutary genius of Boerhaave, <HI>"Salutife|ro Boerhaave genio &s;acrum."</HI> It con&s;i&s;ts of an urn upon a pede&s;tal of black marble; &s;ix heads, four of which repre&s;ent the four ages of life, and two, the &s;ciences in which Boerhaave excelled, form a group i&s;&s;uing between the urn and its &s;upport|ers.

which the arti&s;t has &s;hewn the different em|blems of di&s;orders and their remedies.

Boer|haave quitted the &s;tage of an active and u&s;eful life in 1738, aged &s;ixty nine years.</P>
<P>WE &s;aw an old ca&s;tle in the middle of the town, called the Burg, which was, ac|cording to tradition, built in the ninth century; it is &s;ix hundred and ten feet in circumference, and we a&s;cended the top by fifty &s;teps; from whence we com|manded a complete and charming view of the city, the adjacent meadows, downs, and the Haerlem &s;ea. Within the Burg there is a well of great depth, in which (according to the hi&s;tory of the Span|i&s;h &s;iege under Bald&s;ez) the inhabitants caught a large fi&s;h, which they &s;hewed

in triumph from the walls to the enraged Spaniards. They pretend al&s;o that there is a communication from the bottom of this well under ground to Catwyk.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;ity is highly worthy at|tention. It was founded in 1575, by the &s;tates, in gratitude for their brave defence, and is the principal of the five which are in the United Provinces, viz. Leyden, Utrecht, Franeker (in Frie&s;land) Groningen and Harderwicke. The build|ing is old and awkward; but the pro|fe&s;&s;ors have been the mo&s;t eminent in Europe, &s;uch as Liprices, Scaliger, Sal|marius, Hein&s;ius, and the renowned Boerhaave.</P>
<P>THE botanical garden, with its &s;tat|ues, the cabinet of natural curio&s;ities, the library, anatomy, petrefactions, and fo&s;&s;ils, are very fine, and well attended. In the phy&s;ical garden we &s;aw the Amer|ican

<P>THE library is only open to men of letters twice a week. This univer&s;ity enjoys many great privileges, even to in|flict death; but the profe&s;&s;ors are &s;ub&s;er|vient to the court of Holland.</P>
<P>THE manufactures of this place were formerly very exten&s;ive, particularly in blue and black &s;uperfine broad cloths, which they had the &s;ecret of dying to greater perfection than any other nation (as the French now have the &s;carlet;) but they have declined very much of late years: They manufacture al&s;o narrow cloths and camblets.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="023039_0098_0FBB9F7FE4B36A90">THERE are many fine &s;eats in the vi|cinity of Leyden which &s;trangers vi&s;it out of curio&s;ity. Their butter is excellent.</P>

<P>I FELL in fortunately with the deacon of the pre&s;byterian church, who &s;poke French perfectly: The moment he found I was an American, the mu&s;cles of his face and the expre&s;&s;ion of his eye plainly declared his partiality for my country; he left his affairs, and I found him very intelligent; to his information, with what I collected from Mon&s;.

John Fau&s;t, a &s;ervant of the Alderman's, &s;tole off the types to Mentz, where he pretended to conjuration, and a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf the merit of the di&s;covery. This is the &s;ame Doctor Fau&s;tus &s;o much
<PB N="108" REF="023039_0105_0FBB9C66B0A65498">
known among the vulgar in America for his league with the devil, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after dinner we went to &s;ee the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays Ko&s;ter made with his wooden types, which are to be &s;een in the type manufactory oppo&s;ite to the old ca|thedral. His &s;tatue, with an elegant Latin in&s;cription, is in the town hou&s;e. The world &s;tand indebted to the late in|genious Ba&s;kerville of Birmingham, in England, for the mo&s;t elegant improve|ment in the art of printing. We exam|ined the proce&s;s of making types, which is very curious and expeditious.</P>
<P>From hence we viewed the old cathe|dral, where we &s;aw the fir&s;t organ in the world, made at Haerlem by the ingenious Mullar, in 1738. It is a &s;tupendous piece of grandeur and ingenuity, contain|ing eight thou&s;and pipes, the large&s;t of which are &s;ixteen inches diameter, and
<PB N="109" REF="023039_0106_0FBB9C69CAA82258">
thirty eight feet long. It has &s;ixty eight &s;tops, and imitates mo&s;t admirably, the human voice, &s;olus, or in chorus; differ|ent kinds of birds, trumpets, flutes, fifes, and a kettle drum. They play the or|gan two days in the week, for the a|mu&s;ement of &s;trangers and the citizens; but, if by particular de&s;ire, it will co&s;t a ducat to the organi&s;t and a gratuity to the blower.</P>
<P>There are two &s;ilver bells upon the church, which were taken by the famous Admiral Braakel (who&s;e tomb I &s;aw at Rotterdam) at <HI>Damietta</HI> in Egypt; as al&s;o three &s;mall &s;hips &s;u&s;pended in the church, with &s;aws on their &s;terns, repre|&s;enting the cutting of the chain of the Nile already mentioned.</P>
<P>WE were &s;hewn in this church bullets &s;ticking in the &s;ides of the walls, which were fired by the Spaniards during the
<PB N="110" REF="023039_0107_0FBB9C6AEA274E38">
terrible &s;iege they &s;u&s;tained in 1572, a|gain&s;t the duke of Alva's &s;on, count Frederick.</P>
<P>THE city was gallantly defended by four thou&s;and men, who were heroically &s;upported by the women; but at length famine obliged them to yield; when two thou&s;and people were the in&s;tant victims of Spani&s;h fury, contrary to the expre&s;s terms of capitulation.</P>
<P>HAERLEM lies about four miles from the &s;ea, has eight gates, is built of brick, and the &s;treets re&s;emble tho&s;e of Leyden. By an exact e&s;timation, made about fifty years ago, this city contained &s;even thou|&s;and nine hundred and &s;ixty three hou&s;es, and fifty thou&s;and people; at pre&s;ent the numbers do no exceed forty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>THEIR trade is chiefly with Am&s;ter|dam, and principally in linen, ribbons,
<PB N="111" REF="023039_0108_0FBB9C6E88E2B820">
&s;ome guazes, and tapes, of which they weave fifty pieces at a time by the aid of mills.</P>
<P>ITS &s;ituation, lying contiguous to Haerlem lake, and the peculiar &s;limy qualities of its water being more favour|able to bleaching than any other, gives them a &s;uperiour advantage in the white|ne&s;s of their linen.</P>
<P>THE Iri&s;h formerly &s;ent va&s;t quan|tities of linen to be bleached here annu|ally.</P>
<P>THE meadows all around the country are as white as our American fields after a &s;now &s;torm.</P>
<P>THE &s;tadthou&s;e is a large building; where we &s;aw &s;everal fine paintings in the prince's appartment, particularly that which repre&s;ents the golden age.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="023039_0109_0FBB9C7026DA22F0">LATE in the afternoon, we left Haer|lem and embarked for Am&s;terdam upon an elevated canal, running in a direct line, with a row of trees and &s;tone po&s;ts upon our right. About half way we exchanged boats, and traver&s;ed acro&s;s a little cau&s;eway which divides Haerlem lake upon our right, from the river Y upon our left, which falls by Am&s;terdam into the Zuder &s;ea. This lake is four|teen miles over each way, and was form|ed by an inundation about three centu|ries pa&s;t, which buried &s;eventy two towns and villages in its progre&s;s, and afforded a perfect repre&s;entation of the flood in miniature&mdash;every living creature, and all the effects in the country, floating pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly&mdash;&s;ome on the tops of the hou&s;es&mdash;others hanging to the limbs of trees, &amp;c. &amp;c. This famous lake would be only ranked as a pond in America, where nature forms every thing upon a broad &s;cale&mdash;here it is thought more of,
<PB N="113" REF="023039_0110_0FBB9C71A5D96078">
than we think of our lake Superiour, which is capable of receiving three &s;uch republicks upon its area.</P>
<P>FROM the top of the cau&s;eway we had a full view both of the lake and river; as well as the &s;tately palace of Zwanen|berg, where the directors of the dykes and canals a&s;&s;emble.</P>
<P>THE canal led in a &s;traight line from the cau&s;eway to Am&s;terdam, which we &s;aw mo&s;t of the way before us: But the variety we &s;o ju&s;tly expected to meet near the metropolis was by no means &s;o plea&s;|ing as in entering Haerlem&mdash;indepen|dent of a &s;trong &s;tench ri&s;ing from the &s;tagnated canal water.</P>
<P>I TRAVERSED over the be&s;t part of Am&s;terdam before I came to my lodg|ings, viz. at the fir&s;t bible in the Hier Graght. I find the be&s;t inns dignify

<P>AS my only object in this country is to &s;ee the ways of the world, and to gra&s;p at every u&s;eful or amu&s;ing information that comes within my reach; &s;o I &s;hall go in my loo&s;e Journal &s;tyle until I &s;ee you.</P>

<HEAD>SATURDAY.</HEAD>
<P>I EMPLOYED the whole day in taking a cur&s;ory view of this exten&s;ive metropo|lis of the Seven Provinces; as well as the
<PB N="116" REF="023039_0113_0FBB9C7CC45D8208">
harbour, and a fore&s;t of &s;hipping, which do not appear &s;o numerous as upon the Thames. Viewed the docks, and &s;aw &s;everal new men of war of &s;eventy four guns, and &s;everal old ones, which they convey in and out of their artificial docks, and quite to the Texel, by the aid of camels; a curious invention, which re|ceives their hulls within its body.</P>
<P>WE next viewed a clergyman's cab|inet of natural curio&s;ities&mdash;a great, and bigoted antiquarian: The collection was indeed extremely curious; but he dwelt on the latent merits of every object with &s;o much ardour that we were glad to ef|fect our retreat after &s;ome difficulty.</P>
<P>FROM thence, chance directed me into the Jews' &s;ynagogue; here I remained a full hour; and as it was the fir&s;t time I was ever in a &s;ynagogue of a Saturday evening, I was much plea&s;ed with this
<PB N="117" REF="023039_0114_0FBB9C7DA29C61D0">
&s;ingular novelty&mdash;as well as the angelick &s;hrill notes of a beautiful young lad, accompanied with tho&s;e of an old fellow, (well known in the mu&s;ical world by the name of Leonar) who was piping with his hollow, grum belly, a mo&s;t admirable ba&s;&s;o&mdash;indeed I could hardly per&s;uade my&s;elf I was not deceived by a fine in|&s;trument, until a near approach to the altar convinced me the mu&s;ick was vocal.</P>
<P>AS the &s;un verged towards the horizon, the voices, and agitation of the whole congregation, increa&s;ed to &s;uch vehe|mence, and gave them &s;uch frightful looks, that I was almo&s;t apprehen&s;ive they were falling into &s;trong convul&s;ions. Stunned with their bellowing, I was glad to retreat to the open air, not only for the &s;afety of my head&mdash;but pockets&mdash;for in fact they looked, for the mo&s;t part, like &s;habby theives and pickpockets.</P>

<HEAD>MONDAY.</HEAD>
<P>VIEWED the &s;tadthou&s;e thoroughly, a de&s;cription of which will come with Am|&s;terdam. We &s;aw from the top, the Zuy|der &s;ea, Haerlem lake, and this va&s;t city, and a cloud of &s;hipping below us; though the pro&s;pect encompa&s;&s;ed a con|&s;iderable range of country, and a rich fea&s;t for contemplation, yet it does not equal the pro&s;pect from St. Laurence's church in Rotterdam.</P>
<P>THE chime on the &s;tadthou&s;e is &s;up|po&s;ed to be the fine&s;t in Europe; we ex|amined
<PB N="119" REF="023039_0116_0FBB9C8350ECFE18">
it throughout&mdash;an immen&s;e work indeed&mdash;we waited on the roof until it played; it is &s;o contrived like an organ, that a man can play upon it with the &s;ame ea&s;e.</P>
<P>WE were &s;hewn all the curio&s;ities in this celebrated building, and were charm|ed with the paintings; in particular the one by Vandyke, which repre&s;ents the duke of Alva, in conference with the bur|geoi&s;e of Am&s;terdam, before they abjured the Spani&s;h yoke; this painting &s;trongly repre&s;ents that dark and bloody charac|ter he afterwards exhibited to the world; at the &s;ame time a bold and martial a&s;|pect.</P>
<P>AT two o'clock I went upon the ex|change and delivered my &s;everal letters of introduction from Mr. A&mdash;. This exchange is longer than London, but not &s;o large, nor will it hold a compari|&s;on

either with that of London, or Rot|terdam, in neatne&s;s or elegance, being built with brick, and dive&s;ted of orna|ments. At full change it was complete|ly crowded. As I had nothing more than curio&s;ity to engage my attention, I retired into one corner, to contemplate the &s;cene; which led me to compare this exchange to a gla&s;s beehive I &s;aw at the famous Wildman's at the foot of High|gate hill, which was to all intents Am|&s;terdam change in miniature. The buz was the &s;ame&mdash;the eagerne&s;s of the bees crowding into the hive; and their in|du&s;try and ardour to collect the hon|ey&mdash;was all the &s;ame&mdash;but it would be rather illiberal to carry the idea &s;o far, as to &s;uppo&s;e them all a &s;et of in&s;ects, in general actuated by noth|ing beyond the ideas of a bee, who trips from flower to flower, and roams abroad in the wide world, to &s;uck in the &s;weets of every plant, with no other

<P>SPENT the evening at the French the|atre, which is a &s;mall thatched hou&s;e like a barn; the actors however were good; there were few genteel people at the play, which is very extraordinary in a me|tropolis, e&s;pecially as this is their only &s;ummer's amu&s;ement, in this line. The Dutch play hou&s;e for winter amu&s;ements is much more elegant.</P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>TUESDAY.</HEAD>
<P>CROSSED the river Y, or Wye, in a mix|ed company of Germans, Americans, and Engli&s;h; and landed at Sardan, &s;ix miles from, and nearly oppo&s;ite to, Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="023039_0119_0FBB9C8A64160598">WE pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;hipping in the harbour, and then had a complete view of the river, and a fore&s;t of ma&s;ts, ar|ranged with much order.</P>
<P>IN approaching Sardan a battalion of windmills &s;eemed to be drawn up in ar|ray in our front. This extraordinary town appeared to us rather &s;mall, previ|ou&s;ly to our landing; but words are too feeble to expre&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e at the de|ception, as well as the &s;ingularity and di&s;po&s;ition of the hou&s;es, gardens, and almo&s;t every object in a &s;tyle different from any I have yet &s;een.</P>
<P>SARDAN is &s;ituated in Northholland and contains near forty thou&s;and wealthy inhabitants; &s;ome &s;ay it is the riche&s;t town in Holland. They have acquired this wealth principally by the wood trade, &s;hip building, and a variety of cu|rious mills for different purpo&s;es, partic|ularly
<PB N="123" REF="023039_0120_0FBB9C8C1DF83DC0">
paper, powder, tobacco, boards, &amp;c. &amp;c. They &s;hewed us a &s;awmill which works forty &s;aws at a time.</P>
<P>THEY have &s;o much timber always prepared on hand that they can do as much work as the building of a man of war in a week, by having three months previous notice. In general they build three hundred &s;ail of merchantmen yearly.</P>
<P>AFTER rambling through this charm|ing and very curious place for &s;ome hours, we were conducted to a &s;mall hou&s;e, in which Peter the great boarded with the common workmen, at the time he learn|ed the &s;hip carpenter's trade <HI>incog.</HI> and was the mo&s;t faithful and laborious man in the yard. He afterwards worked at Chatham docks in England.</P>
<P>THE woman of the hou&s;e &s;hewed us a gold medal lately pre&s;ented her by the
<PB N="124" REF="023039_0121_0FBB9C9223E10348">
empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia. This &s;ingular whim of Peter (who was one of the greate&s;t &s;overeigns Europe was ever ble&s;&s;ed with) prepared him for the great fatigues he afterwards endured in contending with Charles XII, of Sweden, and civilizing his exten&s;ive dominions.</P>
<P>THIS place is a perfect Chine&s;e pic|ture; the buildings are rather &s;mall, but mo&s;t whim&s;ically beautiful; and for the mo&s;t part painted in various colours, and the roofs are of glazed tiles: They have in front hand&s;ome parterres; and gardens behind, &s;o finely di&s;po&s;ed, as to exceed all belief.</P>
<P>THE town covers over a large &s;pace of ground, the canals are very long, with a chain of the&s;e enchanting hou&s;es &s;tretch|ing in a line by their &s;ides.</P>
<P>THE genius and cu&s;toms of the North-Hollanders are different from the other
<PB N="125" REF="023039_0122_0FBB9C93664AD758">
provinces, and many are very &s;ingular; for in&s;tance&mdash;they pu&s;h their exce&s;s of neat|ne&s;s to &s;uch extremes that the ma&s;ters of hou&s;es, are po&s;itively obliged by cu&s;|tom to pull off their &s;hoes at their <HI>own doors,</HI> where a &s;ervant &s;tands ready with a pair of &s;lippers. Again, the front doors are never opened but in ca&s;es of death and marriage. The women are &s;trangely metamorpho&s;ed, and differently dre&s;&s;ed from the Southholland la&s;&s;es: Their heads are bound up with broad gold, or bra&s;s ridges, running acro&s;s their fore|heads, they have light caps, their hair out &s;hort before&mdash;prodigious large earrings, and broad flat hats, cocked up in the air, made of calico; which have a &s;ingular effect: But under all the&s;e di&s;advantages, I &s;aw many beautiful faces, but vile &s;hapes; the girls look &s;o much alike that one would be almo&s;t led to think they were all &s;i&s;ters.</P>

<HEAD>WEDNESDAY.</HEAD>
<P>WE took a waggon for Bruck, &s;ix miles di&s;tant, which in many re&s;pects exceeds Sardan, and is allowed by travellers to be the very model and pink of neatne&s;s, for all Holland; and without exception, it might be drawn as the mo&s;t perfect picture of any city or town in the world.</P>
<P>IT is chiefly inhabited by commercial veterans, who have retired from Am&s;ter|dam, immer&s;ed in wealth. They carry on largely in the banking and in&s;uring line. Neither hor&s;es or carriages, are &s;uffered in the &s;treets of this fairy village, which are finely paved with different coloured &s;tones, fancifully worked in various rep|re&s;entations, and &s;trewed lightly over with &s;and, with as much care as the in&s;ide of their hou&s;es; which are very curious in|deed, and every thing we &s;aw glittered
<PB N="127" REF="023039_0124_0FBB9C9A04591D08">
&s;o &s;trongly with neatne&s;s, that our eyes were fairly weakened with gazing.</P>
<P>THE preliminary article previous to a court&s;hip, in Northholland, is very &s;in|gular, but generally ob&s;erved. The mi&s;|erable lover &s;tands making under his mi&s;tre&s;s's window, two or three hours every night, for three months &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively: If he holds out the &s;iege firm|ly to the end of this time, he is then admitted to her pre&s;ence, upon the in|tended ties of matrimony&mdash;but never before: She indeed at times, deigns to &s;olace his trembling doubts, with a word of comfort. An intelligent Engli&s;h gentleman, re&s;iding in Holland, whom we met in the &s;treets of Sardan, &s;ays this cu&s;tom prevails only in Northholland, and originated from the Spaniards, who re&s;ided among them before the revolution. Heav|ens! what a contra&s;t between this and our bundling cu&s;tom in Newengland?</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="023039_0125_0FBB9C9AF0FDC750">THEY are remarkably coy of &s;trangers, and always marry among them&s;elves; in con&s;equence, the originality of their cu&s;toms are pre&s;erved free from contam|ination.</P>
<P>LATE in the afternoon returned to Sardan, and embarked immediately for Am&s;terdam, with upwards of one hun|dred of us, crowded in, male and female, under the hatches: Soon after we left the &s;hore, we were &s;uddenly attacked by a thunder &s;quall and heavy rain, &s;o that our &s;kipper was obliged to &s;hut the hatches, which gave us all the &s;ame com|plection, and opened a wide field for mer|riment.</P>
<P>MY &s;ituation was &s;o odd&mdash;wedged up between two Dutch la&s;&s;es&mdash;in the dark &mdash;and &s;tanding all like &s;heep in a pen&mdash; as mu&s;t have excited the mirth of the mo&s;t phlegmatick Engli&s;hman. I felt
<PB N="129" REF="023039_0126_0FBB9C9C629CA050">
the full force of my &s;ituation, and it put me in a fine flow of &s;pirits. In &s;pite of the danger of di&s;locating my under jaw, I gagged out, by <HI>main force,</HI> a few Dutch words I had &s;tolen, but &s;o highly &s;ea|&s;oned with Engli&s;h and French, that I could hardly make my&s;elf under&s;tood: However, as I always feel my&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to contribute to the merriment of the company when travelling, I endeavoured to make up, in ge&s;tures and laughing, what I was deficient in Dutch. The Dutch however, as I ob&s;erved on another occa&s;ion, laugh with pain, and never without rea&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>THURSDAY.</HEAD>
<P>DINED at my friend Myer's upon the Hier Graght, in company with &s;everal Americans&mdash;among the re&s;t was the love|ly Mi&s;s P&mdash;. After dinner we made a party and &s;trolled through the be&s;t &s;treets
<PB N="130" REF="023039_0127_0FBB9CA114E91E70">
of this wealthy city. We cro&s;&s;ed the river Am&s;tel, where we viewed with plea&s;|ure a va&s;t number of &s;luices, calculated to communicate the river and the Am|&s;terdam canals; we viewed the river from a high bridge, which afforded an exten|&s;ive and plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of the town, river, trees, &s;luices and truk&s;chutes.</P>
<P>FINISHED the evening at a place called Vauxhall. We had coffee in a large room, filled with parties under cover of volumes of &s;moke. At the end of the room we were entertained by a company of French and Italian &s;ingers.</P>
<P>ON our return, being curious to &s;ee the amu&s;ements of a &s;pillhou&s;e, we were con|ducted to the mo&s;t celebrated one. But, my &s;tars! what a &s;cence!&mdash;I have never heard Am&s;terdam mentioned but the&s;e &s;pillhou&s;es were e&s;teemed a principal cu|rio&s;ity; they are licen&s;ed by the police for

the protection and &s;afety of mode&s;t wom|en&mdash;and are noted for the regulation they are under. I could not however endure the &s;ight five minutes&mdash;my feelings were too &s;en&s;ibly attacked&mdash;the &s;moke was &s;o thick, and the company &s;o vulgar, that I was glad to decamp after having &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity. In entering we were oblig|ed to pay for a bottle of <HI>vinegar,</HI> (called wine) whether we had it or not; and then we crowded through a gang of &s;moking jack tars, boors, and vulgar citizens, to the other end of the room; where I was much diverted to &s;ee a &s;trapping negro fellow dancing a jig with one of the &s;pill|hou&s;e ladies, and an old man playing upon a violin. The dancing was curi|ous enough&mdash;they &s;eemed to dance, or rather to &s;lide, heavily upon their heels, &s;caling about the room, without the lea&s;t order or animation. Indeed they &s;eem|ed to me like a couple of artificial ma|chines &s;et in motion.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="023039_0129_0FBB9CA4A27F5450">BUT alas! in ca&s;ting my eyes about me, I was &s;ickened to the &s;oul with an idea that darted acro&s;s my brain.

<P>THEY have in Holland, I am told, another curious method of puni&s;hing criminals&mdash;who are confined at a pump, in a ci&s;tern of water up to their chins, which runs in as fa&s;t as they can pump it out; &s;o that they are obliged to exert them&s;elves until their &s;trength is exhau&s;t|ed to prevent drowning. I believe this is the method taken to conquer the ob&s;ti|nacy of tho&s;e who refu&s;e to labour.</P>

<P>DINED at Mynheer Van S&mdash;ph&mdash;&s;t's (a capital merchant) with a brilliant company, in the French &s;tyle. Mum was the word two minutes before we at|tacked the &s;oup. In leaving the polite Dutchman's table, we paid our two flor|ins to the &s;ervant at the door, as regu|larly as at the table d' h&ocirc;te in Paris. A mo&s;t barbarous cu&s;tom, which was exploded not many years &s;ince in Eng|land, where it commonly co&s;t a gentle|man half a guinea to dine with <HI>his friend.</HI></P>

<P>IN the evening I had the plea&s;ure of gallanting <HI>la belle Americane</HI> to the French play, where the company was very bril|iant&mdash;the beauty and maje&s;ty of her per|&s;on,

while it gratified my pride, drew the eyes of the Dutch ladies; and I thought I could read in them &s;omething like envy; they are however very elegant, both in their per&s;ons and manners, as they ri&s;e above the vulgar.</P>
<P>I HAVE more than once had occa&s;ion to remark, that the Engli&s;h authors are too apt to confine their remarks up|on national characters, to the vulgar cla&s;s of mankind, (as though they a&s;&s;oci|ated with no others;) which is extreme|ly illiberal, and has a tendency to impre&s;s unfair ideas of a nation. In this re&s;pect the French are infinitely more liberal and good natured. When a Frenchman travels in England, he freely allows them <HI>all their merit.</HI> But how different is it with the Engli&s;h who travel in France? Sterne and Moore are almo&s;t the only Engli&s;h authors who have &s;oared above the prejudices of their countrymen.</P>

<P>AT &s;even o'clock this morning I left Am&s;terdam, with two Americans, in com|pany

with Mr. F&mdash;, of the hou&s;e of de la L&mdash;and F&mdash;, on our way to Haer|lem, purpo&s;ely to hear them play on the famous organ already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>AS my life has been fertile in adven|tures, I had a plea&s;ing one in the line of gallantry in this excur&s;ion to add to the number. As &s;oon as I had &s;eated my&s;elf in the roof of the truk&s;chute, a very fa|cetious, &s;prightly Dutch lady came in, and &s;eated her&s;elf directly oppo&s;ite to me, with only a narrow table between.&mdash; Thus &s;ituated&mdash;inattention would have been too cold for a warm con&s;titution&mdash; Her countenance expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much vi|vacity that we &s;oon found our&s;elves upon &s;ociable terms&mdash;which in its progre&s;s af|forded merriment for my brother travel|lers quite to Haerlem&mdash;where I conduct|ed her to her lodgings, and parted with regret.&mdash;The Dutch ladies &s;eem as

much addicted to intrigue and gallantry as the French.</P>
<P>IN one hour I rejoined my companions at the church, and was charmed to hear this a&s;toni&s;hing organ perform. The human voice is &s;o admirably imitated, that I almo&s;t doubted the te&s;timony of my own eyes and ears.</P>
<P>RETURNED in the afternoon in the body of a truk&s;chute, full of pa&s;&s;engers. Another thunder &s;torm attacked us&mdash;we were obliged to drop our furled curtains and &s;ubmit to darkne&s;s.&mdash;In this &s;itua|tion a &s;ingular incident happened, which fir&s;t alarmed and afterwards diverted us extremely. A Dutch Jew in the boat had a peculiar talent of imitating the crying of a child to the nice&s;t perfection, with an empty pipe, which he did as &s;oon as the curtains were dropped&mdash;every one &s;uppo&s;ing a child in the canal, run their

heads out in the rain on all &s;ides&mdash;the crying in&s;tantly cea&s;ed, and we hunted in the canal and in the boat in vain, for a child&mdash;This artifice was practi&s;ed upon us &s;everal times before we detected the impo&s;ture. The old women, never at a lo&s;s for a cau&s;e, began to &s;u&s;pect the boat was haunted.</P>
<P>IN the morning I intend for Utrecht, and have it in contemplation to go from thence to Berlin, to &s;ee the immortal old Frederick. I mu&s;t devote this evening to dige&s;t the materials I have collected relative to Am&s;terdam, its trade, &amp;c.</P>
<P>AMSTERDAM, the capital of the &s;even provinces, lays in lon. 4.30. E. and lat. 52.20. N. two hundred and thirty miles north ea&s;t from Paris, and two hundred ea&s;t from London, &s;ituated upon the river Wye, which empties into the Zuyder Zee. It contains, according to popular e&s;tima|tion,
<PB N="140" REF="023039_0137_0FBB9CB9C5A89BC0">
three hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls, (I be|lieve two hundred and fifty thou&s;and) and twenty &s;ix thou&s;and hou&s;es, equal to the number in Paris, and perhaps in general as large, though containing only half the number of inhabitants.</P>
<P>THIS city was hardly known in the thirteenth century, and owes its ri&s;e and grandeur to the deluge of inhabitants which poured into it from Antwerp in the civil wars.</P>
<P>IT is built in form of a cre&s;cent, and well fortified, with a &s;trong wall and twenty &s;ix ba&s;tions, each of which have a windmill in their centre: The ditch is environed with a &s;pacious canal, em|belli&s;hed with a double row of trees. In the extent of their commerce it is thought they will not yield to London, though it is allowed to have been on the decline for many years; this copious &s;ub|ject
<PB N="141" REF="023039_0138_0FBB9CBBE74B6AF0">
I &s;hall enter more largely on in the ap|pendix. Upwards of two thou&s;and &s;hips enter annually in the Wye from every quarter of the globe. The &s;hallowne&s;s of the Zuyder Zee is a great ob&s;tacle in the way of di&s;patch; but on the other hand protects them effectually from naval ene|mies. The city is built principally up|on piles, at an enormous expen&s;e, which may be ea&s;ily conceived when thirteen thou&s;and were required for the founda|tion of the &s;tadthou&s;e alone. The &s;treets are generally wide and well paved, many of which have canals in the middle, with trees on each &s;ide; &s;ome of them are e&s;|teemed the fine&s;t in Europe. The &s;quares are very mean, the mo&s;t con&s;id|erable of which is the one the &s;tadthou&s;e is built on.</P>
<P>THIS is a noble &s;tructure, and the principal object in Am&s;terdam. It is two hundred and eighty two feet long, two
<PB N="142" REF="023039_0139_0FBB9CBD64378BA0">
hundred and thirty five wide, and one hundred &s;ixteen high, con&s;tructed with hewn &s;tone, and is &s;aid to have co&s;t two millions &s;terling. The armory, bank, bells, paintings, and burghers' hall, are the material objects; particularly the hall, which is one hundred and twenty feet long, fifty &s;even broad, and ninety high, all built with marble, which is really a&s;toni&s;hing, when we con&s;ider that there is &s;carcely a native pebble to be &s;een in the whole country. The floor repre&s;ents, in marble, the cele&s;tial and terre&s;trial globes, and the con&s;tellations in the heavens, mo&s;t curiou&s;ly inlaid.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;es are built, in general, of brick&mdash;&s;ome of hewn &s;tone. The &s;treets are not &s;o clean, nor the hou&s;es &s;o ele|gant, in general, as tho&s;e of Rotterdam; but the &s;treets are well paved. All re|ligions are tolerated&mdash;but Calvini&s;m is by far the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, and no other
<PB N="143" REF="023039_0140_0FBB9CC227B39AD0">
churches are allowed bells. The ar&s;enal well merits &s;eeing, as well as the dock yard, which lies contiguous to it, and is five hundred and eight feet long, and well &s;upplied with naval &s;tores.</P>
<P>THE air is &s;trongly impregnated with noxious vapours, and the &s;tench which ri&s;es from the canals. The water is bad; the be&s;t for common u&s;e is that which the clouds empty into their ci&s;terns.</P>
<P>THE ho&s;pitals, and other charitable in&s;titutions, are very great, as they &s;up|port upwards of twenty thou&s;and poor in this way&mdash;but they do not hold a pro|portion to the va&s;t profu&s;ion the citizens of London be&s;tow for the&s;e benevolent purpo&s;es, much to their honour.</P>
<P>THIS city is governed by a Senate of thirty &s;ix per&s;ons. Trumpeters are kept upon the &s;teeples and towers in the
<PB N="144" REF="023039_0141_0FBB9CC4277B9310">
night, to give the alarm in ca&s;e of fire. The revenues of Am&s;terdam, it is &s;aid, amount to fifty thou&s;and florins a day. Their trade extends to all quarters, but the mo&s;t lucrative is to the Ea&s;tindies.</P>

<P>AT &s;ix o'clock this cloudy morning I embarked on board the Utrecht truk&s;|chute, with a Mr. Vanbiber (an Ameri|can gentleman) and a full freight of pa&s;|&s;engers, and in nine hours &s;ailing we reached Utrecht. We &s;ailed through a beautiful country, more abounding in elegant &s;eats and &s;ummer hou&s;es, (be|longing to the wealthy citizens of Am|&s;terdam) than any part of Holland I have yet &s;een; e&s;pecially within a few miles of Utrecht, where we &s;aw a con|tinued chain of them, &s;ome of which were mere palaces.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="023039_0142_0FBB9CC81620CF68">DINED at a Mr. Peter&s;on's, a rich mer|chant, and an American by birth. Af|ter dinner he conducted us into every part of this city, which is built upon a natural elevation compared to the mari|time cities. It lies twenty three miles S. E. from Am&s;terdam, is e&s;teemed healthy, and rendered remarkable in hi&s;|tory, for the celebrated treaty which ce|mented the union of the Seven Provinces, in 1579.</P>
<P>IT contains from twenty to thirty thou&s;and inhabitants&mdash;party &s;pirit runs high among the citizens, who are arming, and exerci&s;ing every day in oppo&s;ition to the prince of Orange; who&s;e party &s;tyle it rebellion, and a French faction.

Military di&s;traction beats high in every vein; but nature and humanity &s;hrink from the

tragick thought, that the&s;e enchanting fields may be verging fa&s;t to the fatal change into parks of bellowing murder, encampments, and &s;cenes of death, where family kindred may be darting the weap|ons of de&s;truction at each other.</P>
<P>VIEWED the old cathedral, the middle of which is blown down, but the tower is entire. Saw the monument of an old bi&s;hop, with fourteen others in <HI>ba&s;&s;o re|lievo,</HI> the heads of which were all batter|ed to pieces, at the time of the violent re|ligious per&s;ecution, which occa&s;ioned the revolt in the bloody reign of Philip II.</P>
<P>WE a&s;cended the top of the tower, which is three hundred and &s;eventy feet high, by four hundred and &s;ixty &s;teps; where we had a mo&s;t &s;ublime view of all the low country, the Downs, Haerlem lake, and Zuyder Zee; our horizon was rather hazy, which ob&s;tructed a much

more exten&s;ive pro&s;pect. I am told that in a clear day, fifty walled cities may be comprehended in one view from this place.</P>
<P>THE country in the vicinity of Utrecht appeared like a continued garden. A chain of &s;mall hills and the Downs in &s;ome mea&s;ure checked our view to the ea&s;tward. The wind blew a gale, and I was almo&s;t apprehen&s;ive that this crazy old tower, which has re&s;i&s;ted &s;ieges and tempe&s;ts for near a thou&s;and years, would at la&s;t tumble down and bury poor me in its ruins: The roaring of the winds through the hollow arches, and the ruins of the old church under us, naturally excited the&s;e vapours; &s;o I hurried down to examine the univer&s;ity; after which I went to a famous garden, belonging to Madame Van Mollem, and adjoining to a &s;ilk machine, which is con&s;tructed nearly upon the &s;ame principles as the one I

<P>THE two grottos, the gardener tells us, co&s;t ten thou&s;and pounds &s;terling each, being mo&s;tly formed by a rare collection of &s;hells from the different quarters of the globe.

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE but this moment got on board, and am &s;o much worn down with fatigue that I can &s;carcely &s;tand. The wind now blows a complete gale, &s;o I mu&s;t improve the moment, or other|wi&s;e I &s;hall &s;oon be too &s;ick to tell you how I got along.</P>
<P>LAST evening, at eight o'clock, I em|barked on board the Leyden truk&s;chute at Utrecht, with a civil &s;kipper, and, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince I have been in Hol|land,
<PB N="152" REF="023039_0149_0FBB9CDCF16562C0">
I found my French and Engli&s;h of no avail; of cour&s;e I was obliged to pound Dutch with the Captain.</P>
<P>I HAD the cabin or roof all to my&s;elf, which I wi&s;hed to avoid, as I feel a &s;trong propen&s;ity to improve every mo|ment in &s;ociety; of which &s;carcely any &s;ort can come ami&s;s to one who travels for information.&mdash;Under this impre&s;&s;ion I left the cabin and entered upon the li&s;t of &s;mokers in the body of the boat; but found no one di&s;po&s;ed to be &s;ociable with a poor fellow who had not a word to &s;ay for him&s;elf. So, finding my tongue u&s;ele&s;s, I returned again to my cabin, and &s;pent the night upon cu&s;hions on the bench, &s;ometimes viewing the coun|try from the cabin windows by a fair moon light, and reading occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P>WE de&s;cended the canal as far as the town of Woerden, which is walled in&mdash;
<PB N="153" REF="023039_0150_0FBB9CE3252093E0">
here we entered a branch of the Rhine, and gave our&s;elves up to its gentle cur|rent; and in this plea&s;ing &s;ituation we continued de&s;cending the river, and pa&s;&s;|ing many villages and a plea&s;ant country, till we reached Leyden, at &s;ix o'clock in the morning. I found this new mode of travelling much more agreeable than on the canals, as the river is wider and the water continually alive. Be&s;ides, it was a &s;ublime &s;cene in the night to view the effect of the moon upon the country, through a double row of trees planted on the banks of the river.</P>
<P>I PASSED through the &s;treets of Ley|den, and immediately reembarked upon the Delft canal. Saw the burgeoi&s;e un|der arms in the &s;tadthou&s;e.

The harbour was full of fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els; and though it is the re&s;idence chiefly of fi&s;hermen, it will vie, I am told, with almo&s;t any town in Holland, for neatne&s;s and plea&s;ant &s;treets, with canals, trees, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>IT is not an hour &s;ince I ar|rived, and you would laugh heartily to &s;ee what a figure I make. I left off my journal very &s;ea &s;ick&mdash;we had indeed a mo&s;t unplea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age of twenty four hours, and a tumultuous head &s;ea, which kept our packet dancing merrily upon the waves; but we mi&s;erable pa&s;&s;engers were no otherwi&s;e &s;ociable than in ca&s;cading <HI>en concert</HI> over our lee quarter, which we kept up &s;ociably until the moment we landed on the coa&s;t of Suffolk.

in off Yarmouth, and &s;ailed along the high coa&s;t of England, till abrea&s;t of Le&s;|tof, and then we embarked reluctantly, fourteen in number, on board of an open fi&s;hing boat, two miles from the &s;hore, with a &s;qually black atmo&s;phere for our comfort. No con&s;ideration would have induced us to hazard &s;uch a ri&s;k but the mi&s;ery of confinement, perhaps twen|ty four hours longer, with the &s;hore aboard.</P>
<P>WE landed in the &s;urges beating upon the &s;hore, and refre&s;hed our&s;elves mo&s;t comfortably&mdash;with a reviving di&s;h of good tea to &s;ettle our giddy heads.

<HEAD>ORIGIN and DESCRIPTION OF THE <HI>UNITED PROVINCES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HOLLAND belonged origin|ally to the hou&s;e of Burgundy, and fell under that of Au&s;tria, which united it to the Spani&s;h crown, by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Charles V, to that throne. The bigot|ted and bloody per&s;ecutions of his &s;on Philip II, produced a revolt in the &s;even|teen provinces, ten of which returned to their allegiance; and the pre&s;ent United Provinces pur&s;ued their oppo&s;ition (with a degree of bravery and per&s;everance that
<PB N="163" REF="023039_0160_0FBB9CFAF94AEA78">
reflects honour on human nature) until the year 1648, when they were declared independent, after a glorious &s;truggle of &s;eventy &s;ix bloody years, valiantly fight|ing through four &s;ucceeding generations, for every ble&s;&s;ing of civil and religious liberty, dear to mankind. The va&s;t po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions they had wre&s;ted from the Portu|gue&s;e in the Ea&s;tindies, either by fraud or by force, enabled them to contend with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t Spani&s;h gold, and two of the mo&s;t powerful monarchs in Europe.</P>
<P>THE Seven Provinces, which compo&s;e this formidable republick, the wonder and admiration of the world&mdash;are Hol|land, Zealand, Frie&s;land, Guelderland, Overy&s;&s;el, Groningen and Utrecht.&mdash; They extend about one hundred and fifty miles each way, including the Zuyder Zee and Haerlem lake; which, taken with their rivers, and numerous canals, leaves a doubt which of the elements,
<PB N="164" REF="023039_0161_0FBB9CFDBAA28368">
land or water, occupies the greate&s;t &s;pace within this area, which embraces, by a late calculation, nine thou&s;and one hun|dred and forty &s;quare miles. The Maes and the Rhine are the principal rivers.</P>
<P>TRAVELLING is cheaper in Holland than in any other country, as it does not exceed one penny &s;terling per mile in the truk&s;chutes, exclu&s;ive of baggage.</P>
<P>THE face of the earth lying level, and often lower than the &s;urface of the &s;ea, naturally leads a &s;tranger to imagine that the whole country has e&s;caped by acci|dent the dominion of the ocean, which will apparently &s;ooner or later rea&s;&s;ume its prerogative, of which their hi&s;tory furni&s;hes many frightful examples; in particular the fatal inundation, already mentioned, in 1421.</P>
<P>THE heavine&s;s of this foggy and moi&s;t atmo&s;phere is undoubtedly unhealthy:
<PB N="165" REF="023039_0162_0FBB9CFEAA26FC30">
And it is from this circum&s;tance that their &s;lovenly neighbours wi&s;h to rob them of the merit of their exce&s;&s;ive neatne&s;s, as they &s;ay (and perhaps with &s;ome rea&s;on) that it is a merit of nece&s;&s;ity to have their hou&s;es painted, and every thing around them clean and bright.</P>
<P>THEIR winters begin in October and end in March. The &s;ummers are often very hot, &s;hort, and &s;ubject to frequent changes. The number of inhabitants varies extremely in the popular e&s;tima|tion; but from the be&s;t information they do not exceed two millions and an half, which are evidently on the decline, ow|ing to a variety of concurrent circum|&s;tances. The two principal cau&s;es, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, ari&s;e from the in&s;en&s;ible decline of manufactures, and con&s;equently of commerce&mdash;with the increa&s;e of luxury, and a great degeneracy from their virtu|ous ance&s;tors, who procured them their

independence, and left the government e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the broad ba&s;is of ju&s;|tice, indu&s;try, enterpri&s;e, and frugality.</P>
<P>THOSE who pretend to pry deep into futurity, predict their total annihilation as an independent power. It is at lea&s;t evident that their va&s;t and rich po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Ea&s;tindies, will eventually produce the &s;ame effect upon Holland, as the gold mines of Southamerica have upon Spain &mdash;I mean national debility, corruption, lo&s;s of manufactures, and con&s;equently poverty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEVERAL nations of Europe now manufacture the arti|cles they formerly received from the Dutch, particularly the Engli&s;h.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SHOULD the Emperor per&s;evere in his wi&s;e and ambitious plan of opening the Scheld, and reviving the commerce of Antwerp (once the emporium and glory of Europe) it will mo&s;t certainly tend to accelerate their rapid decline. The Scheld
<PB N="167" REF="023039_0164_0FBB9D041E9A2310">
is a noble river, and will admit &s;hips of any burthen quite up to the city, which is very ea&s;y of acce&s;s from the North Sea, and has a communication with the Rhine, Maes, and Lis. In this ca&s;e a doubt cannot be entertained but Antwerp would rapidly ri&s;e to its former &s;plendour, and &s;oon be crowded with commercial adven|turers from all quarters of Europe, and even from Holland it&s;elf, as Germany will open a wide field for enterpri&s;e. As Am|&s;terdam ro&s;e on the ruins of Antwerp, &s;o it is probable that Antwerp would on tho&s;e of Am&s;terdam, and perhaps almo&s;t re&s;ume its former rank among the cities of Europe, were once the Scheld opened.</P>
<P>THE main &s;prings of the Dutch wealth in the Ea&s;tindies, is the monopoly of the &s;pice trade, in which they are in &s;ome danger of meeting rivals, notwith&s;tand|ing all their art and indu&s;try to pre|vent it.</P>

This &s;ecret was &s;tolen from Ceylon, Amboyna, and Banda, by &s;ome French merchants.</P>
<P>THE canals in Holland are &s;o much frequented that the roads are neglected, and in general very bad, but mo&s;tly lined with trees, barriers, and turnpikes at &s;hort di&s;tances.</P>
<P>THERE are no regular po&s;t coaches&mdash; con&s;equently every one is &s;ubject to the impo&s;ition of the waggoners.</P>
