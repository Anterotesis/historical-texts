<P>_IT was now a Time of Di&s;tre&s;s and Fear with AHAZ King of JUDAH, and his whole King|dom: <HI>His Heart was moved, and the Heart of his People, as the trees of the Wood are moved with the Wind.</HI> The Rea&s;on of this &s;ore Amazement, is open'd in the 2d Ver&s;e of this Chapter, in the&s;e Words, <HI>And it was told the
<PB N="6" REF="005752_0004_1026F56F0F2C4700">
Hou&s;e of</HI> DAVID, <HI>&s;aying,</HI> SYRIA <HI>is confederate with</HI> EPHRAIM. The <HI>Original</HI> here rendered <HI>is confe|derate,</HI> &s;ignifies, as a learned Critick ob&s;erves, <HI>is re&s;ted</HI>; and may import, not only that the&s;e confe|derate Forces were joined, but that they were al|ready encamped in the Borders of the Tribe of EPHRAIM; which was not a great way di&s;tant from JERUSALEM the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of JUDEA. And no wonder that AHAZ, and all his loyal Subjects, were &s;urprized at the Tidings of &s;o powerful an Inva&s;ion, threatning the Lo&s;s of every Thing that was near and dear to them.</P>
<P>IT was while King AHAZ was under fearful Apprehen&s;ions as to the Con&s;equence of this <HI>Confe|deracy</HI> again&s;t him, that God &s;ent the Prophet ISAIAH with a &s;pecial Me&s;&s;age to him; partly to hu&s;h his Fears, by a&s;&s;uring him, that the Attempt of the&s;e Kings to rend his Kingdom from him &s;hould prove vain; and partly to forewarn him of the Evil that &s;hould befall his Land from another King, the King of ASSYRIA, upon whom he too much depended: Interpo&s;ing, by the Way, as a &s;ure Ground of Sup|port to <HI>the Hou&s;e of</HI> DAVID, under their pre&s;ent Difficulty, that remarkable Prophecy concerning the MESSIAH, that he &s;hould be <HI>born of a Virgin.</HI></P>
<P>THE Me&s;&s;age the Prophet was &s;ent to deliver to him begins with the 4th Ver&s;e, where he be|&s;peaks him in that Language, <HI>Take Heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted for the two Tails of tho&s;e &s;moaking Fire-brands, for the fierce Anger of</HI> REZIN <HI>with</HI> SYRIA, and of the Son of
<PB N="7" REF="005752_0005_1026F5717184C9D0">
REMALIAH. Some think the Advice here given to the King is intended, at lea&s;t in Part, to moderate his <HI>angry</HI> Re&s;entments. <HI>Take Heed, and be quiet.</HI> Look to it, that you keep your Temper; that you don't fly into a Pa&s;&s;ion; and &s;peak unadvi&s;edly with your Lips: Have a Care you don't complain of Providence, and murmur again&s;t God for &s;uffering the&s;e powerful Enemies to combine together in an enterprize to deprive you of your Crown, and en|&s;lave your People. But others more probably &s;up|po&s;e the De&s;ign of the Advice is, to re&s;train his Fear within due Bounds and Limits: As if it had been &s;aid, See that you keep the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your &s;elf; don't be di&s;pirited; don't &s;uffer your Heart to melt and fail within you; don't let your Fears prevail &s;o as to betray you into any Thing unworthy your Dig|nity as a King, or that may reflect Di&s;honour on God.</P>
<P>AND, as an Enforcement of this Advice, the Prophet, under the Direction of God, compares the&s;e <HI>confederate Kings,</HI> in a Way of Contempt, to <HI>two Tails of &s;moaking Fire-brands.</HI> They &s;eemed to AHAZ <HI>fierce</HI> and <HI>furious,</HI> like burning <HI>Brands of Fire</HI>; yea, his &s;urpri&s;ed Imagination repre&s;ented their united Force by a <HI>raging Fire,</HI> who&s;e Violence could not be re&s;i&s;ted. But the Prophet, to allay his Fears, a&s;&s;ures him from God they &s;hould prove no|thing more than <HI>&s;moaking Fire-brands.</HI> They might for a while make a Smoother; but they &s;hould not be able to do him any con&s;iderable Hurt. Yea, he is commi&s;&s;ion'd to tell him, they were only the <HI>Tails</HI> or <HI>Ends</HI> of <HI>&s;moaking Fire-brands.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="005752_0006_1026F57683C7F0F8">
Their Force was &s;pent; they &s;hould &s;oon expire; they &s;hould ea&s;ily be put out.</P>
<P>THE Prophet goes on with his Me&s;&s;age in the Words I have read to you for the Text, <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> SYRIA EPHRAIM, <HI>and the Son of</HI> REMALIAH <HI>have taken evil Coun&s;el again&s;t thee, &s;aying, Let us go up again&s;t</HI> JUDAH, <HI>and vex it; and let us make a Breach in it for us, and &s;et a</HI> KING <HI>in the Mid&s;t of it, even the Son of</HI> TABEAL. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, it &s;hall not &s;tand, neither &s;hall it come to pa&s;s.</HI> In which Words the three following Things are ob&s;ervable,</P>
<P N="1">I. A REPRESENTATION of the <HI>De&s;ign</HI> which the confederate Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL had formed again&s;t AHAZ; which was to dethrone him, and <HI>&s;et a King in the Mid&s;t of his Kingdom, even the Son of</HI> TABEAL.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE Re&s;olution of Heaven to <HI>bring this De|&s;ign to nought. Thus &s;aith the Lord God, it &s;hall not &s;tand, neither &s;hall it come to pa&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of this Re&s;olution; &s;ugge&s;ted in tho&s;e Words, <HI>Becau&s;e they have taken evil Coun|&s;el again&s;t thee, &s;aying, Let us go up again&s;t</HI> JU|DAH, &amp;c.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, the&s;e are the Particulars we &s;hall di&s;tinctly con&s;ider; but with all po&s;&s;ible Bre|vity,
<PB N="9" REF="005752_0007_1026F579B0BAC310">
that we may have more Time to apply them to the Circum&s;tances of our <HI>Nation</HI> at this Day.</P>
<P N="1">I. The fir&s;t Thing contained in the Words of the Prophet is a Repre&s;entation of the <HI>De&s;ign,</HI> which the confederate Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL had formed again&s;t AHAZ King of JUDAH.</P>
<P>SYRIA, EPHRAIM, and <HI>the Son of</HI> REMALIAH are the <HI>Confederates</HI> &s;poken of in the Text, as en|gaged in the De&s;ign again&s;t JUDAH: But, by a common Figure, SYRIA is here put for the <HI>King</HI> of SYRIA; and EPHRAIM being the known Scrip|ture Term giving Denomination to the <HI>ten Tribes,</HI> or the Kingdom of ISRAEL, and <HI>the Son of</HI> REMA|LIAH being their King, he is the Per&s;on here in|tended: So that by SYRIA, EPHRAIM, and <HI>the Son of</HI> REMALIAH, we are to under&s;tand the Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL. The &s;ame Thing is meant as if the&s;e two Kings had been mentioned by Name. To be &s;ure, the&s;e were the allied Potentates who had formed a <HI>De&s;ign</HI> again&s;t the Kingdom of JU|DAH; and the <HI>Prophet</HI> here opens their De&s;ign, and plainly tells AHAZ their King what it was. And this he does by bringing them in, &s;aying, as in the middle Clau&s;e of the Text, <HI>Let us go up again&s;t</HI> JUDAH, <HI>and vex it; and let us make a Breach in it for us, and &s;et a</HI> KING <HI>in the mid&s;t of it, even the Son of</HI> TABEAL. Their Scheme was to de|throne AHAZ, and &s;et up a PRETENDER in his Room, con&s;tituting him King of JUDAH.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005752_0008_1026F57E0EEA8310">WHO this Man was they intended to exalt to the Throne, we can't tell at this Di&s;tance of Time. He is called in the Text, <HI>the Son of</HI> TABEAL. And this is all we certainly know about him. Some conjecture he was a SYRIAN; others think he was an ISRAELITE; others a <HI>Native</HI> of JUDEA, but in the Intere&s;t of SYRIA and ISRAEL, and a fit <HI>Tool</HI> to &s;erve their Turn. This &s;eems mo&s;t probable; and that he <HI>pretended</HI> &s;ome Sort of Right to the Crown, and had a Party in the Kingdom who abetted him. But whoever he was, and whether he pretended a Right to the Crown or not, he was the <HI>Creature</HI> of the&s;e confederate Kings, a &s;utable Engine for them to work with; and therefore they re&s;olve to &s;et the <HI>Crown</HI> of JUDAH on his Head. This was the De&s;ign they had principally in their View; and the <HI>Means</HI> they re&s;olved upon in order to ac|compli&s;h it, are particularly recorded in the Text.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Thing they determined upon, in a Way of Means, the Prophet expre&s;&s;es in their own Words, <HI>Let us,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>go up again&s;t</HI> JUDAH. The Thing re&s;olved upon is an Inva&s;ion of their Land. This they judged nece&s;&s;ary; an Expedient without which they might not hope for Succe&s;s. 'Tis likely a Party in the Kingdom had an Affection for this <HI>Son of</HI> TABEAL, lik'd well the Scheme of making him King, and would gladly be a&s;&s;i&s;ting in it, could a Way be contrived to bring about &s;o great a Revolution. Such Intelligence as this at the Courts of SYRIA and ISRAEL might give Ri&s;e to their Re&s;olution <HI>to go up again&s;t</HI> JUDAH. A con&s;iderable Force from <HI>abroad</HI> they judged might
<PB N="11" REF="005752_0009_1026F57FAA01CCA8">
countenance the Di&s;affected at <HI>home,</HI> and &s;pirit them to ri&s;e up in Rebellion again&s;t their rightful and lawful King: They therefore project an Inva&s;ion, as a hopeful Method to &s;ucceed in their Intention to di&s;place AHAZ, and &s;et <HI>the Son of</HI> TABEAL on the Throne.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Means they re&s;olved upon whereby to effect this De&s;ign was, the filling JUDAH with <HI>Vexation</HI> and <HI>Sorrow. Let us go up again&s;t</HI> JU|DAH, &s;ay they, <HI>and vex it.</HI> The Meaning is, Let us ravage their Country, pillage and plunder their Towns and Cities, and &s;o vex and harra&s;s them as to make them weary of adhering to their pre&s;ent King, and willing to take the <HI>Son of</HI> TABEAL to reign over them.</P>
<P>NOR was this all, but they determine upon a more mi&s;chievous Means &s;till in order to compa&s;s their De&s;ign again&s;t JUDAH; which was, <HI>to make a Breach in it for them. Let us go,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>and make a Breach in it for us,</HI> i. e. &s;ay &s;ome, Let us penetrate into the Heart of the Country, advance even to JERUSALEM, the head or capital City of it, and make a Breach in its Wall, a Breach wide e|nough for us to march in; without which there will be no Hope to &s;et a King in the mid&s;t of the Land. <HI>Let us make a Breach in it for us,</HI> i. e. &s;ay others, Let us rend the Kingdom from AHAZ, part in Twain, and &s;hare it between us; placing over it a King of our own, <HI>the Son of</HI> TABEAL, our very good Friend, in whom we have a joint Intere&s;t, and on whom we may both with Safety depend.
<PB N="12" REF="005752_0010_1026F584B6533DE8">
<HI>Let us make a Breach in it for us,</HI> i. e. &s;ay others, Let us tear the Kingdom to Peices by enflaming the Di&s;affection there may be in the Minds of the People to their pre&s;ent King, and his Admini&s;tra|tion; by promoting Broils and civil Di&s;cords among them, dividing and getting them into Parties. Let us work by the di&s;contented, factious and turbulent Spirits there are among them; &s;etting them one again&s;t another, whereby they will weaken them|&s;elves and &s;trengthen us.</P>
<P>AND this Sen&s;e of the Words, as it is agreeable to the <HI>Original,</HI> &s;o it well &s;utes with their De&s;ign to &s;et up a <HI>new King.</HI> This is &s;eldom attempted, unle&s;s a Nation is &s;uppo&s;ed to have tho&s;e within them&s;elves, who will help forward &s;uch a Change. And when this is the Ca&s;e, a foreign Inva&s;ion is more likely to effect a Revolution in Government. This might be con&s;idered by the allied Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL, and they might go <HI>again&s;t</HI> JUDAH in Expectation of <HI>making a Breach in it,</HI> i. e. of dividing the People, &s;tirring up in them a Spirit of Hatred, Animo&s;ity and Variance: And they might probably hope to gain a Party from a|mong them to join in their Attempt again&s;t the Crown of AHAZ, and to exalt <HI>the Son of</HI> TABEAL to the Throne.</P>
<P>THIS now was their <HI>De&s;ign</HI>: It aim'd at nothing &s;hort of overturning the Con&s;titution, of dethroning the King of JUDAH, and &s;etting his Crown on the Head of a vagrant <HI>Pretender.</HI> And the Means in order to accompli&s;h this De&s;ign, was an Inva&s;ion
<PB N="13" REF="005752_0011_1026DE5850A0D218">
of the Land; di&s;tre&s;&s;ing its Inhabitants, and divi|ding them into Parties.</P>
<P>AND as they had concerted &s;o plau&s;ible a Scheme, they little doubted of Succe&s;s in the Execution of it: But this the righteous &s;overeign God would not grant; which leads to the next Thing ob&s;ervable in the Text, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. THE <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> of Heaven to bring this <HI>De|&s;ign to nought</HI>; contained in the&s;e Words, <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, it &s;hall not &s;tand, neither &s;hall it come to pa&s;s.</HI> Their Mea&s;ures &s;hall be broken, the Enterpri&s;e they have undertaken &s;hall be con|founded.</P>
<P><HI>IT &s;hall not &s;tand.</HI> This is a Phra&s;e &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of the divine Plea&s;ure to defeat the In|tention of the&s;e <HI>confederate Kings</HI> again&s;t JUDAH. A De&s;ign is &s;aid <HI>to &s;tand,</HI> according to the Genius of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language, when it takes Effect. Hence that of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> Prov. 30.11. <HI>The Coun&s;el of the Lord &s;tandeth forever.</HI> It forever takes Place. On the other Hand, A De&s;ign is &s;aid <HI>not to &s;tand,</HI> when it fails of its Accompli&s;hment, proves fru&s;trate and vain. And this is the Thing here intended. <HI>It &s;hall not &s;tand.</HI> 'Tis as if it had been affirmed, it &s;hall not be carried into Execution; but, like <HI>the Coun&s;el of the Heathen be brought to nought</HI>; like <HI>the Devices of the People made of none effect.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="005752_0012_1026F587D7520438">IT is added, <HI>neither &s;hall it come to pa&s;s.</HI> In the <HI>Original</HI> 'tis, <HI>neither &s;hall it be</HI>; which may have a further Empha&s;is in it. For a Thing purpo&s;ed may be <HI>produced,</HI> and yet not <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI>; it may be bro't into <HI>Being,</HI> and for all that fall to the Ground and <HI>come to nothing.</HI> But this Re&s;ult of <HI>their's</HI> &s;hall never have Exi&s;tence: <HI>It &s;hall not be.</HI> 'Tis as if the Prophet had &s;aid, AHAZ &s;hall not be dethron'd; JUDAH &s;hall not be en&s;laved. The Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL have de&s;ign'd this; but it &s;hall no more be, than if they had not formed &s;uch a De&s;ign: So far from it, that the&s;e Kings them&s;elves &s;hall be &s;ubdued, <HI>the Riches of</HI> DAMASCUS, the chief Seat of the King of SYRIA, <HI>&s;hall be taken away</HI>; and EPHRAIM <HI>&s;hall be broken that it be not a People,</HI> as it follows in this and the next Chapter.</P>
<P>AND AHAZ, to whom this Me&s;&s;age was &s;ent, had rea&s;on to depend upon the Truth of its Con|tents. For it is introduced with a <HI>thus &s;aith the Lord God.</HI> The Prophet did not &s;ugge&s;t his own Wi&s;hes; he did not deliver his own Conjectures up|on the probable Appearances of Things: But &s;pake as immediately &s;ent from God, and &s;aid nothing but what he was in&s;tructed from Heaven to &s;ay.</P>
<P>AND that AHAZ might have no Rea&s;on for Doubt upon this Head, the Prophet, in God's Name, al|lows him to a&s;k a <HI>Sign</HI> for the Confirmation of his Faith, Ver&s;e 11. <HI>A&s;k thee a Sign of the Lord thy God; a&s;k it either in the Depth, or in the Height above.</HI> He is permitted to make his own Choice, to a&s;k &s;uch a Sign as he him&s;elf plea&s;ed, either in <HI>Heaven</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="005752_0013_1026F58CBA1D49F0">
or <HI>Earth</HI>; as that the Sun might &s;tand &s;till, or go back, or withdraw his Light for a while; or that there might be a Convul&s;ion in the Earth, or a Re|moval of it out of its Place, or the like extraordinary and miraculous Performance.</P>
<P>ONE would think this was eno' to &s;atisfy Infide|lity it&s;elf; and yet, AHAZ was faithle&s;s and unbe|lieving. He refu&s;ed this gracious conde&s;cending Offer of God, &s;aying, as in the 12th Ver&s;e, <HI>I will not a&s;k.</HI> He pretends indeed a <HI>pious</HI> Rea&s;on; <HI>I will not tempt the Lord</HI>: As if it would be a tempting God to do that which he had him&s;elf permitted, yea, directed him to do. But this was a meer Pretence. The <HI>true</HI> Rea&s;on, why he would not a&s;k a Sign was, becau&s;e he was re&s;olved to provide for his own Safety a &s;ecurer Way, as he imagined. His De|pendance was upon the ASSYRIANS for Help: He cho&s;e rather to rely upon an Arm of Fle&s;h, than upon the God of JACOB, in whom is everla&s;ting Strength.</P>
<P>UPON which the Prophet &s;harply reproves, both <HI>him,</HI> and the <HI>Hou&s;e of</HI> DAVID, for their Contempt of the divine Offer he had made them: But withal lets them under&s;tand, that God would notwith&s;tand|ing give them a Sign. Ver&s;e 13, 14, 15, 16. <HI>Hear ye now, O Hou&s;e of</HI> DAVID, <HI>Is it a &s;mall Thing for you to weary Men? But will ye weary my God al&s;o? Therefore the Lord him&s;elf &s;hall give you a Sign; behold, A Virgin &s;hall conceive, and bear a Son, and &s;hall call his Name Immanuel.

Butter and Honey &s;hall he eat, that he may know to re|fu&s;e the Evil, and chu&s;e the Good.</HI> The Evangeli&s;t MAT|THEW, having given an Account of CHRIST as <HI>born of a Virgin,</HI> adds upon it that ob&s;ervable Remark, Chap. 1.22, 23. <HI>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was &s;poken of the Lord by the Prophet, &s;aying, Behold, a Virgin &s;hall be with Child, and &s;hall bring forth a Son; and they &s;hall call his Name Immanuel.</HI> 'Tis to me very plain, the Evan|geli&s;t MATTHEW tho't this Pa&s;&s;age in ISAIAH a Pro|phecy of CHRIST; foretelling that he &s;hould be <HI>conceived in the Womb of a Virgin,</HI> and <HI>born of one who knew no Man.</HI> And when he &s;ays of CHRIST's being born of a Virgin, <HI>that it was, that it might be fulfilled which was &s;poken of the Lord, by the Prophet,</HI> it is evident, he &s;peaks of this Event as an Accompli&s;hment of this Prophecy. I know, it has been pleaded by &s;ome, that nothing more is intended by the Phra&s;e, <HI>this was done that it might be fulfilled which was &s;poken by the Prophet,</HI> than only an Analogy between the Birth of CHRIST, and the Birth of a Child in the Days of the Pro|phet ISAIAH, an Event now an&s;wering to an Event in former Times: But this by no Means comes up to the pro|per Force of the Expre&s;&s;ions here u&s;ed. In the <HI>Original</HI> the Language is as &s;trong as in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lation: And there are no Words, either in <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> wherein it could have been more peremptorily declared, that the Con|ception of CHRIST in the Womb of one that was a pure Virgin, <HI>was the Thing prophe&s;ied by the Prophet</HI> ISAIAH, and that this Prophecy received its real intended Fulfillment in the Conception and Birth of CHRIST, as here related.</P><P>The plain Truth is, this Prophecy, &s;trictly and literally inter|preted, agrees to none but CHRIST; and it was perfectly an&s;wered in him. 'Tis evident from the current Strain of the <HI>new Te&s;tament</HI> writers, that he was <HI>born of a Virgin,</HI> literally &s;peaking; that he really was the Thing intended by IMMANUEL, <HI>God with us,</HI> God and Man in one Per|&s;on, God manife&s;ted in the Fle&s;h, and dwelling with Man|kind; and that he was nouri&s;hed and bro't up like other Children, tho' he was not born like them, but of a Virgin. <HI>Butter and Honey did he eat,</HI> i. e. he was fed, when a Child, with the common Aliment given to Children in tho&s;e Coun|tries, which was <HI>Milk or Butter and Honey.</HI> And he was thus nouri&s;hed, <HI>that he might know,</HI> or until he &s;hould know, as the Words might be more intelligibly rendered, <HI>to refu&s;e the Evil and chu&s;e the Good.</HI> So that this Prophecy is &s;trictly and properly applicable to CHRIST, and was fulfilled in him.</P><P>I confe&s;s indeed, I can't &s;ee how this Prophecy of the Birth of CHRIST could be a <HI>Sign</HI> to the <HI>Hou&s;e of</HI> DAVID, that they &s;hould not be cut off; as it was not to be fulfilled 'till &s;o many Ages after its Delivery: But it's ea&s;y to &s;ee, how it could be an <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> to them that they &s;hould not, and an A&s;&s;urance &s;ea&s;onably and properly given, as, at this Time, they were threaten'd with a total Inva&s;ion by two powerful Kings, who had entred into an Alliance for this Purpo&s;e.</P><P>But you will a&s;k then, What was the <HI>Sign</HI> here given? For the Prophet &s;ays, <HI>the Lord him&s;elf would give them a Sign.</HI></P><P>Now, in order to point this out unto you, I mu&s;t put you in Mind, that when the Prophet ISAIAH was bid to go forth to meet AHAZ, he was ordered by God to take with him his <HI>little Son</HI> SHEAR-JASHUB, as you may &s;ee, Ver&s;e 3. And accordingly he was the Child that is here given, as a <HI>Sign</HI> to AHAZ and <HI>the Hou&s;e of</HI> DAVID, that they &s;hould not be de&s;troyed. Says the Prophet, <HI>The Lord him&s;elf &s;hall give you a Sign.</HI> And the <HI>Sign</HI> is given, not in the Words immediately following, <HI>Behold a Virgin &s;hall con|ceive,</HI> &amp;c.; [The&s;e are rather Introductory to the Sign it &s;elf, looking forward to the Birth of the MESSIAH of a Virgin] but in the 16th Ver&s;e, in tho&s;e Words, <HI>For be|fore the Child &s;hall know to refu&s;e the Evil and chu&s;e the Good, the Land that thou abhorre&s;t &s;hall be for&s;aken of both her Kings.</HI> As if the Prophet had &s;aid, Before this Child of mine, (pointing to him with his Finger) before this my Son SHEAR-JASHUB, whom God has &s;ent with me, &s;hall come to a Capacity of di&s;tingui&s;hing between moral Good and Evil, the&s;e Kings, of whom you are &s;o dreadfully a|fraid, &s;hall be them&s;elves de&s;troyed.</P><P>I own, it would be more natural to interpret the whole Pa&s;|&s;age, as one continued Period, &s;peaking <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> one and the &s;ame Child, if we had not previous Notice that God, for &s;ome &s;pecial Purpo&s;e, had ordered the Prophet to take with him his little Son, when he went to AHAZ: And if we con&s;i|der him as pointing to this his Son, when he delivered the&s;e Words, <HI>Before this Child &s;hall know to refu&s;e the Good and chu&s;e the Evil, the Land which thou abhorre&s;t &s;hall be for&s;aken of both her Kings,</HI> 'tis ea&s;y and natural to under&s;tand him, as &s;peaking, in this Ver&s;e, of a different Child from <HI>that</HI> he &s;pake of in the two foregoing Ones: To be &s;ure, AHAZ and tho&s;e pre&s;ent with him could be at no Lo&s;s to under|&s;tand him in &s;uch a Sen&s;e. And I &s;ee not, while we in|terpret what is &s;aid in the 14th and 15th Ver&s;es, as a <HI>pro|phetic Promi&s;e,</HI> bro't in by way of <HI>Parenthe&s;is</HI>; and what is &s;aid in the 16th Ver&s;e, as the <HI>Sign</HI> given by God to <HI>the Hou&s;e of</HI> DAVID; I &s;ay, I &s;ee not, that the Interpretation is forced, or that it does at all interrupt the Period, or per|plex its Sen&s;e.</P><P>And I can't but think this the true Con&s;truction, becau&s;e it interprets the whole Pa&s;&s;age in a &s;trict and literal Sen&s;e, and yet &s;o as to free it from tho&s;e Objections which have been laid again&s;t it, as it has &s;ometimes been explained.

a Contrivance formed under the Influence of un|governed Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions, without either Rea&s;on or Ju&s;tice to give Countenance to it.

And tho' many both doubted of the Queen's Bigne&s;s, and of the Birth of the Child; yet there was not any one Thing done to &s;a|tisfy them, or put an End to their Doubts.</Q> <HI>Compleat "Hi&s;tory of</HI> ENGLAND, Vol. III. p. 493.</P><P>RAPIN &s;ays <Q>It is univer&s;ally known, that the Birth of this Prince has been very much &s;u&s;pected, and that many then did, and &s;till do, believe it Suppo&s;itions. Multitudes of Papers have been publi&s;hed <HI>for</HI> and <HI>again&s;t</HI>; &s;ome containing the Grounds of the Su&s;picions, and others Arguments to remove them.</Q></P><P>The Arguments confirming the Opinion, that the Queen was not with Child, when &s;he pretended to be &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> that at the Time of her pretended Delivery, only a &s;uppo&s;ed Son was born of her, I &s;hall &s;um up under the following Parti|culars, as I have extracted them from RAPIN, Bi&s;hop BUR|NET, and others.</P><P>1. That the King for certain Rea&s;ons, was become incapable of Children. 2. That the Queen had been &s;even Years without being with Child, and for &s;ix Years in &s;uch an ill State of Health, that tho&s;e about her were a&s;&s;ured &s;he would have no more Children. 3. That all Things about her per&s;on, in the Time of her &s;uppo&s;ed pregnancy, were ob|&s;erved to be managed with a my&s;terious Secre&s;y, into which none were admitted but a few <HI>Papi&s;ts.</HI> 4. That the prin|ce&s;s ANNE, not being well, was urged by the King with an unu&s;ual Vehemence, and at his De&s;ire per&s;waded by others, to go to the BATH; a Contrivance as was thought to have her out of the Way at the Queen's &s;uppo&s;ed Delivery: For upon her going thither, the Queen's <HI>Reckoning</HI> was altered; and upon News at Court, that Prince&s;s ANNE would re|turn from the <HI>Bath</HI> &s;ooner than was expected, (the Waters either really or pretendedly not agreeing with her) the very next Day the Queen gave out that &s;he would go to St. JAMES's, and <HI>look for the good Hour</HI>; tho' WINDSOR was the Place where Preparations had been made for her lying in, and it was told her it was impo&s;&s;ible, on &s;o &s;hort Warning, Things could be got ready at St. JAMES's. But &s;he was &s;o po&s;itive, that &s;he &s;aid <HI>&s;he would lye there that Night tho' &s;he &s;hould lye on the Boards</HI>; and accordingly, thither &s;he went that Night: And it was given out, by all her Train, that &s;he was going to be delivered. Some &s;aid, it would be the <HI>next Morning</HI>; and the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> &s;aid very confidently, <HI>it would be a Boy.</HI> And accordingly next Morning was the Time of the &s;uppo&s;ed Birth of the Prince of WALES. 5. That her Delivery was on a Sunday Morning, when all the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Court Ladies were at Church. 6. That nei|ther the Prince&s;s ANNE of DENMARK, the <HI>Arch-bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> nor the <HI>Dutch Amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> were pre&s;ent at her Labour; tho' they were the three Per&s;ons who ought prin|cipally to have been there. 7. That during her Labour the Curtains of the Bed were drawn clo&s;e, and none came with|in them but the <HI>Midwife</HI> and an <HI>Under-Dre&s;&s;er:</HI> And a Warming-Pan was brought into the Room not <HI>opened,</HI> under Pretence of warming one Side of the Bed, tho' the Wea|ther was extream hot, and the Room heated by a va&s;t Crowd of People. 8. That &s;he never &s;atisfyed the Prince&s;s ANNE and other <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Ladies, either of her being with Child, or of her having been delivered of a Child, in any of tho&s;e Ways which might have carried Conviction with them. 9. That tho' the King, Queen and Courtiers &s;ufficiently knew, before the Delivery, that the Nation &s;u&s;pected an <HI>Impo&s;ture,</HI> they did not u&s;e tho&s;e Precautions as they might, and ought to have done, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e; and in&s;tead of putting it beyond all po&s;&s;ible Doubt, they left &s;o many Marks of Su&s;picion, as cau&s;ed infinite Doubts and Di&s;putes, in&s;omuch that &s;ome <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> them&s;elves owned, that &s;o impor|tant an Affair had been managed with great Supinene&s;s and Imprudence. La&s;tly, That upon the Prince of ORANGE's landing in ENGLAND, not only the <HI>Queen</HI> and <HI>Child</HI> went over to FRANCE, but the <HI>Midwife</HI> &amp; <HI>all a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the Birth</HI> were &s;ent with them, or &s;o di&s;po&s;ed of, that it could never be learned what became of them afterwards.</P><P>If any &s;hould de&s;ire a more full and critical Account of this Affair, they may meet with it in Bi&s;hop BURNET's <HI>Hi&s;tory of his own Times.</HI></P></NOTE></P>

FRANCE and SPAIN, be advanced to the BRITISH Throne? God forbid! The De&s;ign is abominable. It is &s;o in the Sight of every true Friend to the In|tere&s;t of ENGLAND; and, I doubt not, it is &s;o in the Sight of a holy and righteous God: Which leads me,</P>
<P N="3">3. In the <HI>third</HI> and <HI>la&s;t</HI> Place, to mention a few Things tending to encourage us to hope, that God will &s;ay concerning this De&s;ign, <HI>it &s;hall not &s;tand, neither &s;hall it come to pa&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I have no Commi&s;&s;ion to declare this to be the In|tention of God. And indeed, while we con&s;ider the <HI>moral</HI> State of the Nation, we have Rea&s;on for Concern and Fear. Perhaps, it was never in a more corrupt and degenerate State, than at this Day. Were the Truths of God ever more generally di&s;|own'd? Were the Revelations of God ever more generally di&s;believed? Were the Commandments of God ever more generally and &s;hamefully violated?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="005752_0039_1026F5CF810F9370">The Land of our Fore-fathers may ju&s;tly be lamen|ted over in the Language of the Prophet ISAIAH, <HI>Ah &s;inful Nation! A People laden with Iniquity, a Seed of evil Doers! They have for&s;aken the Lord, they have provoked the holy One of</HI> ISRAEL <HI>to Anger.</HI></P>
<P>BUT when we turn our View to the Intere&s;t of the REDEEMER, which will &s;uffer by &s;etting a <HI>po|pi&s;h</HI> Prince on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne, we have &s;trong Rea&s;on for Hope. Will God &s;uffer the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> that <HI>Son of Perdition, who hath exalted him&s;elf into the Seat of</HI> CHRIST, to be again acknowledged and adored, by a Nation who have declared their Ab|horrence of wor&s;hipping him, in&s;tead of the Son of God? Will God &s;uffer the Fopperies and Super&s;ti|tions and abominable Idolatries of the Church of ROME, to take place among a People who have undergone &s;o much in prote&s;ting again&s;t them? Will God &s;uffer the chief Bulwark of the Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e in <HI>Europe</HI> to be broken down and de&s;troy'd? There would be no Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in him &s;hould he, in this Way, puni&s;h us for our Iniquities. But yet, we have great Encouragement to rely on his Power for our Protection and Deliverance, as the De&s;ign of our Enemies is really a De&s;ign again&s;t CHRIST, as well as us; a De&s;ign again&s;t the pure uncorrupt Religion of the Go&s;pel, as well as again&s;t our civil Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>AND it &s;hould animate our Faith and Hope to con&s;ider, how often, and in what remarkable Ways, God has appeared for our Help, when our <HI>popi&s;h</HI> Enemies have laid their Plots as deep as Hell to ruin us; particular In&s;tances whereof might be mention'd, would the Time allow.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="005752_0040_1026F5D11D96CC70">AND it looks like a Token for Good, that &s;uch a Spirit appears in the Nation, among all Sorts of Men, to oppo&s;e this accur&s;ed De&s;ign, at the Peril both of their E&s;tates and Lives. At fir&s;t, it may be, it was treated with too much Neglect and Con|tempt; but &s;ince the Defeat of General COPE, and the Entrance of the <HI>Rebels</HI> into the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of SCOTLAND, the Attention of the Nation has been rou&s;ed; and they are voluntarily mu&s;tering, from all Quarters, for the Defence of their King and Coun|try. And it may be hoped, God intends, in this Way, to put an End to the pre&s;ent Di&s;turbances, and re&s;ettle the Kingdom in Peace and Quiet.</P>
<P>THERE are none among his Maje&s;ty's Subjects more heartily de&s;irous of this, than WE in the&s;e <HI>di&s;tant Provinces.</HI> I don't believe there could be found in them all &s;o much as one NEW-ENGLAND Man, but his Indignation is enkindled at the At|tempt to &s;et a <HI>popi&s;h</HI> PRETENDER on the Throne of GREAT-BRITAIN, in the Room of his Maje&s;ty King GEORGE the Second. And could the Peo|ple, inhabiting the &s;everal <HI>Provinces,</HI> be gathered together in one general A&s;&s;embly, I doubt not, they would join Heart and Voice in the Cry of AMA|SAI, <HI>Thine are we,</HI> DAVID, <HI>and on thy Side, thou Son of</HI> JESSE: <HI>Peace, Peace, be to thee, and Peace be to thine Helpers.</HI></P>
<P>AND horribly ungrateful &s;hould we be, if a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the invaluable Priviledges, <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>reli|gious,</HI> which we enjoy, under the mild and kind Admini&s;tration of &s;o gracious a Sovereign and ten|der Father, did not knit our Hearts to him in Love, di&s;po&s;ing us to all Reverence and Loyalty.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="005752_0041_1026F5D2C1D8E298">AND &s;hall we be dutifully affected to our Sove|reign, and not bow the Knee before the Throne of Mercy for him, now that his Enemies are ri&s;en up in <HI>Rebellion</HI> again&s;t him? This is the only Way, wherein we, who live at &s;uch a Di&s;tance, can help our King and Nation, in &s;ubduing tho&s;e who are endeavouring their Ruin.</P>
<P>AND let us, my <HI>Brethren,</HI> in this Way, expre&s;s our Love, and Gratitude, and Loyalty, to our Sove|reign, and Concern for the Safety of his Kingdom. Let us be con&s;tant and importunate in our Suppli|cations to God, that he would pre&s;erve the <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> and protect the <HI>Crown</HI> of our rightful and lawful King; cloathing his Enemies with Shame, but cau|&s;ing the Crown to flouri&s;h on his Head, and on the Head of his Po&s;terity forever: And that he would mercifully &s;ave his People from <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery</HI>; perpetuating to them the Enjoyment of their <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> which di&s;tingui&s;h them from the o|ther Nations of the Earth.
