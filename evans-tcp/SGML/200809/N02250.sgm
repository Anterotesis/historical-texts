<P>T<HI>HE following</HI> Sermon <HI>met with no lit|tle Approbation from the judicious Auditory, to which it was deliver'd: And I hope will be as acceptable, from the Pre&s;s, as from the Pulpit; and more exten&s;ively profitable. To which end I wi&s;h a Divine</HI> Ble&s;&s;ing <HI>may accompany it into the World! It appears abroad, at the Reque&s;t of</HI> Many. <HI>'Twas preach'd at my de&s;ire, and in my Desk, I mean, where I was to have &s;tood. For which Rea&s;on, the Reverend</HI> Author <HI>demands of me this in Return, That I u&s;her it upon the Stage with &s;ome</HI> Prefatory <HI>Lines: And it &s;eems but a ju&s;t piece of</HI> Gratitude <HI>in me to comply; however they that know</HI> his Age <HI>and</HI> Worth, <HI>may vote it a Tre&s;pa&s;s on Mode&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I'm &s;en&s;ible 'twould be an unbecoming Attempt in me, to enter here into an</HI> Encomium <HI>on the Author and his Performance, as is the manner of tho&s;e that do the like office of Re&s;pect for Others: Nor cou'd any Character from me illustrate his Per&s;onal Merits, or be of any Advantage to his Di&s;cour&s;e; which will commend</HI> it &s;elf <HI>to every &s;erious judicious Reader.

their behalf, for the Grace of God which is given them by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Hereby</HI> of a truth we per|ceive that God is no Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons.

<HEAD>Mankind, by Nature, Equally under Sin.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ROMANS, III. 9.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>What then? are we better then they! No in no wi&s;e: for we have before proved both</HI> Jews <HI>and</HI> Gentiles, <HI>that they are all under Sin.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE <HI>Pride,</HI> which Mankind have by Nature in their Hearts, does very much di&s;po&s;e them to think too highly of them|&s;elves, and too meanly of o|thers. It is a ca&s;e wherein People comparing them&s;elves with others, are not equal Jud|ges; but are too apt to pa&s;s Sentence in their own Favour.</P>
<P>IT would doubtle&s;s be well, if we were herein more Cautious than we are, con&s;idering how &s;ub|ject to be mi&s;taken we be, and what inconvenien|ces do or may attend our being &s;o. Hence that caution given by our Apo&s;tle, <HI>Rom. 12. 3. For I &s;ay through the Grace given unto me, to every Man that is among you, not to think of him&s;elf more highly
<PB N="2" REF="002677_0005_0FE6070E19E7CE30">
than he ought to think; but to think &s;oberly according as God hath dealt to every Man the mea&s;ure of Faith.</HI></P>
<P>IT is therefore very Nece&s;&s;ary that People Labour after <HI>Humility,</HI> and take care that their Hearts be not lifted up with Pride and Vain-glory, but that they be kept in a humble frame con|tinually. And we ought at all times to <HI>Meditate</HI> on &s;uch things as have a Tendency to <HI>hide Pride</HI> from us, and cau&s;e us to &s;ee that we have nothing to boa&s;t of; Nothing on the account whereof we have any rea&s;on to exalt our &s;elves.</P>
<P>AND here one thing, the con&s;ideration whereof may be very Serviceable to us is, <HI>That we are no better by Nature, than</HI> tho&s;e of our Neighbours are, whom we Prefer our &s;elves before; for tho' it will not from hence follow, that we have not <HI>now</HI> the Advantage of them; yet we may hence infer, that if we are any better then they, we may not thank our &s;elves for it, <HI>not having made our &s;elves to differ from them,</HI> and <HI>having nothing which we have not Received.</HI></P>
<P>THE Propo&s;ition from whence this Conclu&s;ion is drawn, is very evidently contained in the words now before us, as will appear when we have con|&s;idered their Connection with tho&s;e in the con|text, and the true &s;ense and meaning of them.</P>
<P>HERE then we may briefly ob&s;erve, that the Apo&s;tle having in the Beginning of this <HI>Third</HI> Chapter of his Epi&s;tle, <HI>ver.</HI> 1, 2. Declared, what great Advantages the <HI>Jews</HI> above others did in|joy, and Vindicated the kindne&s;s of God therein Manife&s;ted unto them; as al&s;o His Ju&s;tice in Pu|ni&s;hing their Di&s;obedience, in what follows unto the end of the <HI>Eighth ver&s;e,</HI> He in my <HI>Text,</HI> An&s;wer|eth
<PB N="3" REF="002677_0006_0FE5F205EB803330">
a Que&s;tion, which he propo&s;eth on this Oc|ca&s;ion, and this, as I Suppo&s;e, that he might pre|vent the <HI>Jews,</HI> from drawing &s;uch a Con&s;equence from what he had been &s;aying, as was neither in|tended, nor implied therein; Namely, that they were better than other People, unto whom God had not granted &s;uch Privileges as he had done unto them. <HI>What then?</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>i. e.</HI> What con|&s;equence may their be drawn from what I have &s;aid? <HI>Are we better than they? i e.</HI> Are we <HI>Jews,</HI> who are &s;o highly privileg'd, as I have declared, any better than others, who enjoy not &s;uch Advantages as we do, and who&s;e Wicked Lives expo&s;e them to God's ju&s;t Di&s;plea&s;ure? Does it follow that becau&s;e we have better Privileges, we mu&s;t needs be a better People! <HI>No, in no wi&s;e. i. e.</HI> Such a Con&s;equence will by no means follow from what I have delivered: I intend no &s;uch thing, nor can &s;uch a Conclu&s;ion be fairly drawn from what I have &s;aid. And that &s;uch a Conclu|&s;ion is neither true, nor according to his mind, he further manife&s;ts in what follows unto the end of the <HI>verse. For we have,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>before Proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under Sin. i. e.</HI> If both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> are &s;uch Sinners as I have before proved they are, or charged them with being, in my foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e about them, it is neither true, nor can you &s;uppo&s;e me to intend, that we who are <HI>Jews,</HI> are any better than the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> but on the contrary, we are all equally Sinfull.</P>
<P>NOT that the Apo&s;tle here intends, that the <HI>Jews</HI> were Generally as bad in their Lives as the <HI>Gentile</HI> Nations were; and that all People and
<PB N="4" REF="002677_0007_0FE6071650803E40">
Nations are actually alike Wicked; for as bad as the <HI>Jews</HI> were, they were not Univer&s;ally &s;o bad as the Nations that <HI>knew not GOD,</HI> and did not call upon his Name. And <HI>we know</HI> well, that all Mankind are not equally Wicked; for there are &s;ome Righteous Per&s;ons, who are <HI>more Excellent than their Neighbours,</HI> Prov. 12. 26. and there are &s;ome Nations, whom <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> doth exalt, while <HI>Sin</HI> is a Reproach unto others.&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT what the Apo&s;tle here intends, is that <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and all Mankind are, <HI>by Nature,</HI> equally under Sin. They are <HI>&s;o</HI> con&s;idered as in their <HI>Natural E&s;tate;</HI> tho' otherwi&s;e, Grace may have made &s;ome difference betwixt them.</P>
<P>THE Words then will afford us this <HI>Doctrine.</HI></P>
<Q>DOCT. THAT, Mankind are all by Nature Equally under Sin; none better than others.</Q>
<P>FOR the Clearing up of this Truth, there are three things to be Con&s;idered; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> (1) What is here intended and implyed in Mens being <HI>under Sin.</HI> (2) What is me'nt by Mens being <HI>by Nature E|qually</HI> &s;o. (3) How it appears that this is the Condition of <HI>all Mankind.</HI></P>
<P>I. LET us Con&s;ider what is intended and im|plyed in Mens being <HI>under Sin.</HI></P>
<P>NOW this implies Several things, As,</P>
<P N="1">1. MENS <HI>committing Sin,</HI> or being Guilty of it. By their being <HI>Guilty,</HI> I here intend their being <HI>Sinners,</HI> or that Relation, which tho&s;e that have Sinned, do &s;tand in unto the Sins that have been Commit|ted by them, on the Account whereof they are &s;aid to be <HI>theirs,</HI> and by which the charge of Sin|ing
<PB N="5" REF="002677_0008_0FE607197B12DD20">
is ju&s;tly fa&s;tened on them. Mens being thus <HI>under Sin</HI> does imply that they have Sinned, either by <HI>omitting</HI> &s;omething which they &s;hould have done, or <HI>doing</HI> &s;omthing which they &s;hould not. Without this, Per&s;ons cannot be truly &s;aid to be <HI>under Sin.</HI> In this &s;ense Per&s;ons may be &s;aid to be <HI>under Sin,</HI> or <HI>Guilty</HI> of it, whether the De|&s;erved Puni&s;hment of their Offences be inflicted on them or not. Thus tho&s;e unto whom the Lord does <HI>not impute Sin,</HI> may be &s;aid to be un|der it, when they have done that which they &s;hould not. Again.</P>
<P N="2">2. MEN are &s;aid to be <HI>under Sin,</HI> as it <HI>dwells</HI> or abides in them, after they have Committed it. Tho&s;e Actions wherein Men Sin again&s;t God, are tran&s;ient and pa&s;s away as &s;oon as they are done; as <HI>Adam</HI> did not continue Eat|ing the Forbidden Fruit; but having &s;o done, his Act therein was gone and pa&s;t: But Mens Actions being thus fini&s;hed, <HI>Sin</HI> remains in the Per&s;ons performing them. There is <HI>after them</HI> a vicious <HI>Habit</HI> or <HI>Inclination</HI> left in the Souls of the Per&s;ons Sinning, which is in it &s;elf truly and properly Sin; being the want of a Conformity unto the Holy Law of God, in Mens Minds or Hearts, and &s;o a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>WHEN Sin is committed, the Soul is as it were Poi&s;oned with it, &s;o as to Remain di&s;po&s;ed to Vice and Wickedne&s;s, being depraved and Sinful. So it was with <HI>Adam,</HI> when he had Sinned again&s;t God; and all his <HI>Po&s;terity</HI> have been Natu|rally full of Sin <HI>ever &s;ince;</HI> as will by and by more fully appear. Hence that in Rom. 7. 20. <HI>Sin that dwelleth in me.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="6" REF="002677_0009_0FE5F206B01F4278">
3. PERSONS may be al&s;o &s;aid to be <HI>under Sin,</HI> on the account of that <HI>Stain</HI> and <HI>Blot</HI> which it leaves on the Per&s;ons committing it, I mean the <HI>&s;hame</HI> and <HI>reproach</HI> which it brings upon them. For tho' this be properly rather an <HI>Effect</HI> of Sin than Sin it &s;elf; yet the effects of Sin, or Puni&s;h|ment of it, being &s;ometimes in Scripture called Sin, Per&s;ons may not unfitly be &s;aid to be <HI>under Sin,</HI> when under them. Hence it is &s;aid of a Per|&s;on committing Sin, <HI>Prov. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> 33. A wound and di&s;honour &s;hall he get, and his reproch &s;hall not be wiped away.</HI> Agreeable hereunto is that in Prov. 14. 34. <HI>Sin is a Reproach unto any People.</HI> Such as bear the Reproach, which Sin has brought up|on them, may on that account be &s;aid to be <HI>under Sin;</HI> and this &s;eems evidently included in <HI>that Ex|pre&s;&s;ion,</HI> as u&s;ed in the Text.</P>
<P N="4">4. MENS being <HI>under Sin</HI> evidently intends their being under the <HI>Guilt</HI> of it. By Guilt here I intend that <HI>Obligation</HI> unto <HI>Puni&s;hment,</HI> under which Men are brought, when they Sin again&s;t God, by the Sentence denounced in that Holy Law of His, which is trangre&s;&s;ed by them; and <HI>not</HI> the <HI>Relation</HI> only, in which they &s;tand unto the Sins which they have Committed; of which be|fore. And Guilt is very frequently taken in the Sense, in which I here under&s;tand it. So in our Con|text, ver&s;e the 19<HI>th. Now we know that what things &s;oever the Law &s;aith, it &s;aith to them who are under the Law: that every Mouth may be &s;topped, and all the World may become Guilty before God.</HI> Or&punc; as it is in the Margin, Subject to the Judgment of God. In this Sense, the word <HI>Guilt</HI> is to be under&s;tood, <HI>P&s;al. 51. 14. Deliver me from bloud-guiltine&s;s, O
<PB N="7" REF="002677_0010_0FE6071C5860AD48">
God.</HI> In this Sense, Per&s;ons <HI>Iniquity</HI> is &s;aid to be <HI>upon them,</HI> when they are bound over to Puni&s;h|ment for it.</P>
<P N="5">5. MEN are &s;aid to be <HI>under Sin,</HI> on the ac|count of the <HI>Reigning Power</HI> of it in and over them. This is &s;omething more than Simply their having Sin <HI>in them,</HI> of which I have before &s;poken, for thus God's own <HI>Children</HI> may be the Subjects of Sin, but Sin does not <HI>Reign</HI> in them, it has no <HI>Do|minion</HI> over them, nor are they the <HI>Servants</HI> of it, as the Apo&s;tle &s;hews, <HI>Rom.</HI> Chap 6. But on the Contrary, &s;uch as are in a State of <HI>Nature,</HI> are un|der the Reigning Power and Dominion of Sin. <HI>Sin reigns in their mortal bodies,</HI> and they do <HI>obey</HI> it in the Lu&s;ts thereof, having their Conver&s;ation in the Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h, and fulfilling the de&s;ires of the Fle&s;h, and of the Mind, being Fooli&s;h and Di&s;obedient, and &s;erving divers Lu&s;ts &amp; Plea&s;ures, as is declared in <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 3. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3. 3. <HI>For we our &s;elves al&s;o were &s;ometimes fooli&s;h, di&s;obedient, de|ceived, &s;erving divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</HI> Of Per&s;ons who are in this Sense under Sin, that is to be under&s;tood <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 20. <HI>When ye were the Servants of Sin, ye were free from Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>We may con&s;ider,</P>
<P>II. WHAT is here intended by Mens being <HI>Equally</HI> under Sin (none better then others) <HI>by Nature.</HI> Now that this does not intend that all Mankind are equally bad in their <HI>Lives,</HI> has been already declared. And when it is &s;aid that Men are <HI>by Nature</HI> alike it &s;eems plainly implyed, that <HI>by Grace</HI> they are or may be far otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>AND very true it is that &s;ince Life and Immor|tality
<PB N="8" REF="002677_0011_0FE6069D4283C4B0">
have been brought to Light by the Go&s;pel, God has put a very great Difference betwixt one and another of the Children of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> making &s;ome of them much better than others. Nor has He only made a difference betwixt tho&s;e that are <HI>Born again,</HI> and &s;uch as are not, but al&s;o betwixt one and another of the&s;e; for as all the <HI>Godly</HI> are not equally <HI>Holy,</HI> &s;o neither are all un|regenerate Per&s;ons &s;uffered to run into the <HI>&s;ame exce&s;s of Riot,</HI> or equally and alike to give up them&s;elves unto a Cour&s;e of Sinning again&s;t God; but many of them are by common Grace re&s;train|ed from Committing Sin, with &s;uch Greedine&s;s as others do; and al&s;o inabled to do many things that are Materially Good, and Beneficial both un|to them&s;elves and others; tho' not &s;uch as are &s;aid to <HI>accompany Salvation.</HI> Heb. 6. 9.</P>
<P>IT is readily granted, that there is &s;uch a Dif|ference betwixt the Children of Men as that now declared; but then it mu&s;t be affirmed that <HI>Grace</HI> and not <HI>Nature</HI> has made it. By <HI>Nature</HI> they are all alike, in Re&s;pect of their Moral E&s;tate or con|dition, none either better or wor&s;e than others: Nor do I by <HI>Nature</HI> here under&s;tand that of Man, in the <HI>State wherein he was Created,</HI> but the Na|ture of Man con&s;idered as in that <HI>E&s;tate</HI> which his <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Fall</HI> brought him into, and as a Subject of tho&s;e Sinful <HI>Inclinations</HI> which by his Apo&s;tacy from God he has Contracted, and of which he Remains a Mi&s;erable Subject till the Grace of God makes &s;ome change in him, or work &s;ome good Effects on him.</P>
<P>I may now Proceed to Con&s;ider,</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="002677_0012_0FE6069E62951E70">
III. <HI>HOW it appears</HI> that this is the Conditi|on of <HI>all Mankind.</HI> Or, that by Nature all Man|kind are equally under Sin; none better than others.</P>
<P>AND this will be evident, if we &s;eriou&s;ly weigh a few things now to be propo&s;ed unto Con&s;idera|tion. Here then I &s;ay,</P>
<P>I. <HI>THAT the Sin and Fall of the fir&s;t</HI> Adam <HI>involved</HI> all <HI>Mankind in it.</HI> There was no diffe|rence made here; one as well as another of <HI>Adam's</HI> Po&s;terity Sinned in him, and fell with him in his fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. <HI>Eve</HI> &s;inned Per&s;onally as <HI>Adam</HI> did, and was al&s;o a <HI>Partaker</HI> with him in <HI>His</HI> Sin, as Acce&s;&s;ary to it, by enticeing him to commit it and &s;o at lea&s;t equally Guilty with him.</P>
<P>BUT all <HI>Adam's</HI> Po&s;terity, being in him, as Branches in the Root, or Stock, out of which they proceed, or as Fruit is fir&s;t in the Tree that bears it, before it is brought forth, they mo&s;t certainly Sinned in him when he &s;inned. They may on this account be as well &s;aid to have done what <HI>he</HI> did when he eat the forbidden fruit, as the Sons of <HI>Levi</HI> are &s;aid to have paid tithes in <HI>Abra|ham,</HI> Heb. 7. 9. But if their being <HI>Naturally</HI> in him, in the manner now expre&s;&s;ed, did not <HI>Ne|ce&s;&s;arily</HI> intitle them to the Guilt and Defilement of his <HI>Sin</HI> (as I do not affirm that it did) <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that rendered it mo&s;t <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and equal that he &s;hould be made a <HI>Publick Per&s;on,</HI> and moral <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> them, in whom (as such) they &s;hould <HI>be</HI> and do and &s;o &s;tand or fall as he &s;hould do. Nor could their being thus <HI>in,</HI> and <HI>repre&s;ented</HI> by him, be any di&s;advantage unto them; for <HI>as</HI> they acted
<PB N="10" REF="002677_0013_0FE606A5DC4749D0">
<HI>in him,</HI> &s;o they would have acted <HI>out of him.</HI> Their <HI>Nature</HI> being the very <HI>&s;ame</HI> with his, they would have done ju&s;t as he did, if put upon the <HI>&s;ame trial</HI> as he was; and therefore could receive no <HI>wrong</HI> by his repre&s;enting of them, and acting for them as their Publick Head. It was al|together as well for them in this way, as it could have been if they had Per&s;onally acted for them|&s;elves, and made their own choice.</P>
<P>NAY, it &s;eems that they were in <HI>le&s;s</HI> danger of a Mi&s;carriage in the <HI>way</HI> fixed on, than they would have been in the <HI>other:</HI> for <HI>Adam</HI> had a far <HI>greater charge</HI> lying on him, than any Per&s;on in a &s;ingle capacity could have had: it is certain that <HI>his own</HI> happine&s;s was as much concerned in the affair as any Per&s;ons could have been, who might have been left to a Per&s;onal Trial in a ca&s;e where|in their eternal &s;afety did depend upon their do|ing as they ought. And be&s;ides this, the welfare or Happine&s;s of all his <HI>Po&s;terity</HI> depended on his o|bedience unto God, in the In&s;tance wherein he was tryed; which we cannot &s;uppo&s;e him to have been Ignorant of; for it is not <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> to think that he could be &s;uch a <HI>Publick Per&s;on,</HI> and yet not be acquainted with it.</P>
<P>NOW the con&s;ideration of this laid a moral obligation on him, to take great heed what he did, and not at once to de&s;troy all his Po&s;terity, together with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THAT the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> did as a Publick Per&s;on thus repre&s;ent, and act for all tho&s;e who in the way of ordinary Generation do proceed from him, and that they fell with him in his fir&s;t Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, the Scriptures do abundantly te&s;tifie.

The <HI>Apo&s;tle Paul</HI> fully a&s;&s;erts and clears up <HI>this</HI> in the <HI>fifth</HI> chapter of his <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> to the <HI>Romans.</HI> In the 12 <HI>ver&s;e,</HI> he tells us, That <HI>by one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and &s;o Death pa&s;&s;ed on all Men, for that all have &s;inned</HI> in him. And in the following context, he declares that <HI>through the offence of one, many are dead;</HI> and that <HI>Judgment was by one, unto condemnation.</HI> And he further tells that <HI>by one Man's offence, death reigned by one.</HI> (ver&s;e 15, 16, 17.) That <HI>Adam</HI> was the <HI>one Man</HI> here &s;poken of, is declared in <HI>ver&s;e</HI> the 14<HI>th.</HI> where we are al&s;o told that he <HI>was the figure</HI> of him that <HI>was to come,</HI> even JESUS CHRIST, who is the head and repre&s;entative of his Seed, as the <HI>fir&s;t Adam</HI> was of his. The A|po&s;tle accordingly tells us, that as in one of <HI>the&s;e</HI> many were made <HI>Sinners;</HI> &s;o in the <HI>other</HI> al&s;o many are made <HI>Righteous,</HI> in ver&s;e the 18, 19, and 21: Agreeable unto this is that al&s;o of the &s;ame <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> in 1 Cor. 15, 21, 22. <HI>As by man came Death, &s;o by man came the Re&s;urrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive.</HI></P>
<P>II. AS all Mankind fell in and with <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;o they were <HI>all Equally</HI> involved in the Guilt and Defilement of his Sin. As they <HI>all fell</HI> in him, &s;o they all fell <HI>Equally</HI> in him. This mu&s;t needs be granted; for all <HI>Adam's</HI> Po&s;terity were <HI>equally related</HI> to him both as their <HI>natural and ap|pointed head.</HI> the covenant of works was <HI>one and the &s;ame,</HI> to which they <HI>all</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;ented, and according to their <HI>obedience</HI> or <HI>di&s;obedience</HI> unto which they were either to <HI>live</HI> or <HI>die;</HI> and they were all <HI>Equally</HI> capable of the Reward promi&s;ed,
<PB N="12" REF="002677_0015_0FE606A7FB195560">
and of the Puni&s;hment threatned in that covenant, and &s;o of all the <HI>Effects</HI> or con&s;equents of <HI>Adams</HI> obedience or di&s;obedience unto God, of what na|ture or kind &s;oever they were. And hence they were all <HI>equally</HI> involved in Sin and Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Here I may more particularly affirm.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT all the Children of <HI>Adam</HI> did by the fall partake <HI>equally</HI> in the Guilt of his Sin. I mean now that <HI>his Sin</HI> was equally <HI>imputed</HI> unto or charged on all of them. Whatever Intere&s;t <HI>any</HI> of them had in it, they <HI>all</HI> had. They being all in one condition, all Shipped on one and the &s;ame bottom, having all one and the &s;ame <HI>Surety,</HI> or Publick Per&s;on to repre&s;ent them, and all fall|ing by one <HI>Offence</HI> of the &s;ame Man, at the very &s;ame time, and under the very &s;ame circum&s;tan|ces; How can it be but that they mu&s;t be <HI>equally Guilty?</HI> The Sin committed mu&s;t needs equally belong to them all. There is no room to &s;uppo&s;e that there could be any difference as to this, nor is there the lea&s;t intimation in Scripture, that there was any: but the contrary is therein fully declared, as &s;hall be pre&s;ently made manife&s;t.</P>
<P>And from hence it follows,</P>
<P>2<HI>ly.</HI> THAT all Mankind are by Nature <HI>equally</HI> liable unto the Judgments, threatned in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience. If <HI>all</HI> had the charge of Sin <HI>Equally</HI> lying on them, were equally chargeable with &s;uch Crimes as do expo&s;e Men unto puni&s;h|ment, then all mu&s;t needs be equally liable to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Puni&s;hments due on the account of them.</P>
<P>THE Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> did accordingly expo&s;e all that were Guilty of it unto Death. Gen. 2. 17.
<PB N="13" REF="002677_0016_0FE606A90E19D530">
<HI>In the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> And Death is agreeably hereunto &s;aid to have <HI>reigned from</HI> Adam <HI>unto</HI> Mo&s;es, <HI>even over them that had not &s;inned after the &s;imilitude of</HI> Adams <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, i. e.</HI> not actually in their own Per|&s;ons as he did, Rom. 5. 13. Hence we are a&s;&s;ured that even God's own People <HI>were by nature Children of wrath even as others,</HI> Eph. 2. 3.</P>
<P>I go on and &s;ay,</P>
<P>3<HI>ly.</HI> THAT Mankind are <HI>all equally</HI> Defiled <HI>by original &s;in.</HI> Or that the Depravation of the Na|ture of Man by the fall, has equally affected all the Children of <HI>Adam;</HI> the Holy child Je&s;us only excepted. The re&s;t of <HI>Adam's</HI> Po&s;terity are equal|ly infected with it. For,</P>
<P N="1">(1) IF we con&s;ider the Depravation of the Humane Nature, which followed on the fall of Man, as a <HI>Penal</HI> Effect of his fir&s;t and great Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, this was certainly a Puni&s;hment <HI>equally due</HI> unto all his offspring.</P>
<P>IT is not to be doubted, but that the moral di&s;tempers of Mens Souls, unto which they have ever &s;ince the fall been &s;ubject, are a ju&s;t <HI>Puni&s;h|ment</HI> of Man's Sin in <HI>Eating the Forbidden Fruit.</HI> They are included in the <HI>Death</HI> threatned, when God &s;aid unto Man, that <HI>in the day he eat thereof, he &s;hould &s;urely die:</HI> The Children of <HI>Adam</HI> have therefore been <HI>dead in &s;in,</HI> ever &s;ince <HI>his</HI> Sin and fall: And that Children are di&s;po&s;ed unto Sin from their very Infancy, <HI>going astray as &s;oon as they are born, &s;peaking lies,</HI> as in P&s;al 58. 3. is an invincible argument of their being Guilty of Ori|ginal Sin; their own actual Sin, not going before, but following after, this Propen&s;ity in their Na|ture to Sin again&s;t God.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="002677_0017_0FE606B182314B68">
BUT now all the Po&s;terity of the <HI>fir&s;t Adam,</HI> be|ing <HI>equally</HI> Guilty of that Sin, which they com|mitted in him, as has been &s;hewed, it plainly follows that &s;o far as the corruption of Man's Nature is to be looked upon as a puni&s;hment of that Sin, it was equally due unto all tho&s;e, who <HI>equally</HI> Partook in the Guilt of <HI>Adams</HI> fir&s;t <HI>Offence.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="2">(2) IF we con&s;ider the corruption of Mans Nature, as <HI>Naturally</HI> Propagated (in the way of <HI>ordinary generation</HI>) from Parents unto Children, all the Children of <HI>Adam</HI> mu&s;t needs in this way partake equally of it. The depravation of our Nature as a natural re&s;ult, or effect of our Apo&s;|ta&s;y from God, mu&s;t needs equally affect all tho&s;e who were in and with <HI>Adam,</HI> plunged into the &s;ame mire and dirt of Sin into which he fell. Tho&s;e who were alike dipt in the &s;ame corrupt Fountain, mu&s;t needs be equally defiled by it.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Original Sin</HI> is <HI>naturally</HI> propagated from Parents unto their Children, is a truth whereof we have no rea&s;on to doubt. When <HI>Adam</HI> did eat of the forbidden fruit, he took a do&s;e of <HI>Poi&s;on,</HI> if I may &s;o &s;peak: Not that I a&s;&s;ert that the <HI>Fruit</HI> of which he partook was properly and naturally &s;o; but the <HI>Sin</HI> which he then commit|ed was poi&s;on unto his <HI>Soul,</HI> and did mo&s;t wofully infect it, producing many grievous Di&s;tempers in it: Yea his very Body was al&s;o affected with it. The Poi&s;on which he thus took, did immediatly infect his whole <HI>Spirit, Soul and Body:</HI> So that his nature was pre&s;ently mo&s;t grievou&s;ly depraved, his under&s;tanding darkned, his heart hardned, his affections di&s;ordered, and all the members of his Body became the ready In&s;truments of unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s:
<PB N="15" REF="002677_0018_0FE606B43974ADE0">
And all his Po&s;terity partook equally of the Di&s;ea&s;es which he thus contracted: For he being infected and defiled, they could not be clean, but as proceeding from him were <HI>altogether Filthy:</HI> For the Di&s;tempers by Man thus contract|ed became <HI>hereditary,</HI> and were nece&s;&s;arily propa|gated to his off &s;pring. His Children were ac|cordingly begotten in his own Sinful Likene&s;s. <HI>Cain</HI> was evidently &s;o, and <HI>Abel</HI> was a <HI>Sinner,</HI> and needed a <HI>Sacrifice.</HI> And of <HI>Seth</HI> it is expre&s;ly &s;aid, that <HI>Adam begat him in his own likene&s;s, after his Image;</HI> and this, after he had lo&s;t <HI>God's Image,</HI> wherein he was created, <HI>Gen.</HI> 5. 3.</P>
<P>NOR where they only <HI>Adam's</HI> immediate Chil|dren, who were thus infected, but the Di&s;temper has kept &s;preading in the world, thro' all the Generations of the Sons and Daughters of <HI>Adam,</HI> no one of them being free from it. Hence that in Job 14. 4. <HI>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.</HI> And Chap. 25 4. <HI>How can he be clean that is born of a woman?</HI> There is not therefore a Man, Woman or Child upon the Earth, but what may truly &s;ay with <HI>David,</HI> in P&s;al. 51. 5. <HI>Behold I was &s;hapen in Iniquity; and in Sin did my mother conceive me.</HI></P>
<P>AS the Sin is the &s;ame, by which all Mankind are defiled; &s;o the <HI>way</HI> of its conveyance to them all, is but one. It pa&s;&s;eth to them in one and the &s;ame Channel of natural Generation: And &s;o e|qually infects all unto whom it does de&s;cend, even all that come into the World in that way.</P>
<P>III. AS Mankind do appear, from what has been already &s;aid, to be equally under Sin; &s;o <HI>God in his word &s;peaks of all men, as</HI> equally Sinful
<PB N="16" REF="002677_0019_0FE606B5D864B870">
by nature. The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> having in our <HI>Text</HI> in|formed us, that none of Mankind are by nature any better than others, but all equally under Sin; does in the following context (from <HI>ver&s;e</HI> the 10<HI>th.</HI> to the 18<HI>th.</HI>) prove the Truth of what he &s;aies; <HI>As it is written,</HI> (&s;aith he,) <HI>There is none Right|eous, no not one: There is none that under &s;tandeth, there is none that &s;eeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unpro|fitable, there is none that doeth good, no not one. Their throat is an open &s;epulchre; with their tongues they have u&s;ed deceit; the poi&s;on of a&s;p, is under their lips: Who&s;e mouth is full of cur&s;ing and bitter|ne&s;s. Their feet are &s;wift to &s;hed blood. De&s;truction and mi&s;ery are in their ways: And the way of peace have they not known. There is no fear of God before their eyes.</HI> The&s;e words the <HI>Apostle</HI> quotes out of the <HI>P&s;alms, Proverbs</HI> and <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> to prove that all Men are by nature <HI>equally</HI> Sinful, and &s;o <HI>very</HI> Sinful as is expre&s;&s;ed in them: and then adds in ver&s;e the 19<HI>th. Now what things &s;oever the Law &s;aith, it &s;aith unto them, who are under the Law: that every mouth may be &s;topt, and all the world may become Guilty before God.</HI> The &s;ame truth is con|firmed by many other <HI>Te&s;timonies</HI> of <HI>Scripture.</HI> As <HI>Gen.</HI> 6. 5. <HI>And God &s;aid that the wickedne&s;s of man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</HI> Jer. 17. 9. <HI>The heart is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked; who can know it?</HI> P&s;al. 58. 3, 4, 5. <HI>The wicked are e&s;tranged from the womb, they goe a&s;tray, as &s;oon as they are born &s;peaking lies. Their Poi&s;on is like the Poi&s;on of a Serpent, they are like the deaf Adder that &s;toppeth her ear, which will

not hearken to the voice of Charmers, charming never &s;o wi&s;ely.</HI></P>
<P>THESE and many other &s;uch like Texts of Scripture mu&s;t needs be under&s;tood as &s;poken of Mankind con&s;ider'd as in their <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>uncon|verted</HI> e&s;tate, and as left unto them&s;elves, (for unto any others the de&s;cription given will not agree) and con&s;equently what is unto this effect &s;aid of them, will hold re&s;pecting <HI>all</HI> &s;uch as they are.</P>
<P>BUT thus much for the Doctrinal Handling of the Point.</P>
<P>THE APPLICATION or <HI>Improvement</HI> of the Truth in&s;i&s;ted on, &s;hall be briefly offered in a few Inferences. And,</P>
<P>USE, 1. IF, as we have now heard, none of Mankind are, by Nature, any better than others, but all equally under Sin; we may from hence very naturally infer, That they are all <HI>exceeding wicked,</HI> and their <HI>condition very mi&s;erable.</HI> If we con&s;ider what the very <HI>wor&s;t</HI> of Men on Earth <HI>actually</HI> be, we may in them &s;ee what all Men, and &s;o even the be&s;t, <HI>by nature</HI> are. When we &s;ee or hear of any Per&s;ons that are extreamly wicked, we are apt to cry out again&s;t them as very <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of Impiety, and &s;uch as are hated of God, and ju&s;tly to be abhorred of Men; (and indeed &s;o they are) but do we duly con&s;ider, that <HI>we our &s;elves,</HI> and even the <HI>be&s;t</HI> Men in the world, are as had by <HI>nature</HI> as <HI>they.</HI> Our <HI>hearts</HI> are by nature as <HI>de&s;|perately wicked</HI> as theirs; and we &s;hould have run into the <HI>&s;ame exce&s;&s;es</HI> in our Lives, as they have done, had not the Grace of God re&s;trained us from
<PB N="18" REF="002677_0021_0FE6071D670FB5C8">
it. If we &s;ee, hear or read of, Covetous Per&s;ons, Liars, Thieves, Adulteres, Murderers, or Bla&s;phe|mers of God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and thereupon ask this que&s;tion, <HI>Are we better then they?</HI> The an&s;wer mu&s;t be, <HI>No, in no wi&s;e;</HI> for it plainly appears, that we are all by nature, equally <HI>under Sin.</HI> If one of the black|e&s;t Catalogues of Sinners that could po&s;&s;ibly be thought of (&s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 21,&mdash;32.) were &s;et before us, we mu&s;t own that we are by nature altogether as bad <HI>as they:</HI> Nay, we are naturally as bad as the very <HI>Devils</HI> are: Even wor&s;e than we are able to Imagin. (<HI>Jer.</HI> 17. 9.) And our <HI>Mi&s;ery,</HI> while we are in our natural E&s;tate, is proportionable to our Wickedne&s;s. While unconverted, we are in e&s;tate of <HI>condemnation,</HI> and the <HI>wrath of God abideth on us.</HI> We are, by nature <HI>children of wrath even as others;</HI> are under God's wrath and cur&s;e, and &s;o liable to all the Mi&s;eries of this Life, to death it &s;elf, and the pains of Hell for ever. We may &s;ee how this our forlorn and wretched E&s;tate by Nature is &s;et forth in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. 2,&mdash;4.</P>
<P>USE 2. WE may from the Truth before us in|fer, <HI>That Sinners cannot be Justified, and &s;aved by any</HI> Legal <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own,</HI> but mu&s;t be made Righteous, by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of another, even <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> the Righteous, if ever they obtain Life Eternal. This conclu&s;ion the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> him&s;elf has already drawn to our hands from the Propo&s;i|tion, which we have had under our con&s;ideration. His inference from it we have in our context, (<HI>v.</HI> 20, to the 28.) which I chu&s;e to expre&s;s in his own words. <HI>Therefore</HI> (&s;aith he,) <HI>by the deeds of the Law, there &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified in God's
<PB N="19" REF="002677_0022_0FE607272EB6C550">
&s;ight: for by the Law is the knowlege of Sin. But now the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God without the Law is manife&s;ted, being witne&s;&s;ed by the Law and the Pro|phets. Even the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, which is by faith of Je&s;us Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference: For all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God; Being ju&s;tified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Je&s;us Christ: Whom God hath &s;et forth to be a propitiation, through &s;aith in his blood, to de|clare his righteou&s;ne&s;s for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins that are pa&s;t, through the forbearance of God; To declare I &s;ay, his righteou&s;ne&s;s: that he might be ju&s;t, and the Ju&s;tifier of him that believeth in Je&s;us. Where is boa&s;ting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude, that a man is ju&s;tified by faith without the deeds of the Law.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;um of the matter is, that Mankind be|ing fallen into &s;uch a Sinful and Mi&s;erable E&s;tate, as their Apo&s;tacy from God has brought them in|to, they can never be ju&s;tified by any Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of their own, nor by any other than that of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> provided by God, and revealed in the Go&s;pel. And this truth is al&s;o confirmed by o|ther places of Scripture, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 2, to 8, and 11. 6. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 11. 12. and <HI>phil.</HI> 3. 9.</P>
<P>IT is evident from <HI>Scripture,</HI> (1.) That unto Man's Ju&s;tification before God, it is required, That he have a <HI>Perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> &s;uch a Righteou&s;ne&s;s as the perfect Law of God requi|reth: And con&s;equently that &s;uch as wou'd be Ju&s;tified by a Righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own perfor|ming, mu&s;t perfectly fulfill the <HI>whole</HI> Law, with|out
<PB N="20" REF="002677_0023_0FE606BC36E1E570">
out being guilty of any failure. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 10, 12. (2.) That Mankind having once <HI>broken</HI> God's holy Law, they can never in their <HI>own Per&s;ons</HI> fulfill it; for however exact they might be &s;up|po&s;ed to be in their obedience, after their Repen|tance yet they mu&s;t needs &s;till remain Sinners, in re&s;pect of their <HI>pa&s;t offences:</HI> And therefore &s;uch a Righteou&s;ne&s;s cannot Ju&s;tifie them in God's &s;ight, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 10, 11. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 20. (3.) That therefore the <HI>only</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s, by which Sin|ners may be Ju&s;tified, is that wrought out by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and revealed in the Go&s;pel. As the Apo&s;tle plainly and fully &s;hews, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 21, to the 26. and <HI>chap.</HI> 5. 18, 19. And hence it followeth (4) That that <HI>Faith,</HI> by which we are &s;aid to be Ju&s;tified, (whatever it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to compre|hend or include in it) cannot be our <HI>ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> nor is it's being &s;o, intended, when it is &s;aid to be <HI>accounted for righteou&s;ne&s;s unto &s;uch as have it,</HI> Rom. 4, 5.</P>
<P>FOR it is certain, <HI>that faith,</HI> by which we are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified, is in Scripture plainly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from <HI>that Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which is received by it, and &s;aid to be <HI>unto</HI> and <HI>upon</HI> them that be|lieve; and which is &s;aid to be <HI>without works</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> works of Men's own doing) <HI>imputed to them,</HI> Rom 3. 22. and 4. 5. 6.</P>
<P>USE 3. WE may from the <HI>Doctrine</HI> ju&s;tly infer, That if there be <HI>now any difference</HI> betwixt one and another of the &s;inful race of Mankind, <HI>So|veraign Divine Grace has made it,</HI> and <HI>not they them&s;elves.</HI> It is not denied, but that there is now a great difference betwixt people, in re&s;pect of their Qualifications and Actions: and it is well if
<PB N="21" REF="002677_0024_0FE6072A86B4B878">
the difference that is betwixt them, be duly ob|&s;erved and acknowledged. There are &s;ome <HI>Righteous Per&s;ons</HI> that are <HI>more excellent than their Neighbours;</HI> Tho&s;e <HI>Saints</HI> in the Earth, and Excel|lent ones, in whom all our <HI>delight</HI> &s;hould be. (<HI>P&s;al.</HI> 16. 3.) There &s;hould certainly be a <HI>re&s;pect</HI> &s;hown unto &s;uch, proportionable to the virtue and good|ne&s;s appearing in them. It is &s;aid concerning a <HI>Godly Man,</HI> That <HI>in his eyes a vile per&s;on is contem|ned, but he honoureth them that fear the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>BUT now from <HI>whence ari&s;eth</HI> this difference, which we &s;ee betwixt one Per&s;on, or People, and another? If &s;ome are <HI>now</HI> better than others, is it owing to <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> that they are &s;o? No &s;urely, this cannot be: For <HI>being by nature no better</HI> than others, they can by nature <HI>do</HI> no better than o|thers do. If Per&s;ons Hearts be ju&s;t alike, their Tempers or Inclinations the very &s;ame, and have none of them any means and helps from <HI>without them,</HI> more than the other have, they will <HI>&s;till</HI> be and act both alike. But if <HI>&s;ome</HI> of tho&s;e, who are alike by nature, do become better than others, we may conclude that &s;ome Influence upon them from <HI>without,</HI> has made that odds: and this can be a&s;cribed unto no other cau&s;e than the Soveraign and Di&s;tingui&s;hing Grace of the Ble&s;&s;ed God. Hence that in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 7. <HI>What maketh thee to differ from another? and what ha&s;t thou that thou didst not receive?</HI> And that in <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 16. So then it is not of <HI>him that willeth,</HI> nor of <HI>him that runneth,</HI> but <HI>of God</HI> that &s;heweth <HI>Mercy.</HI> If then there be any that are better than others, <HI>that</HI> God has made them &s;o, who hath told us, <HI>He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and will have compa&s;&s;ion on

whom he will have compa&s;&s;ion:</HI> And it becomes us to &s;ay as in <HI>Matt.</HI> 11. 26. <HI>Even &s;o, Father, for &s;o it &s;eemeth good in thy &s;ight.</HI></P>
<P>USE 4. WE may learn from the Truth in&s;i&s;ted on, <HI>That Humility and Self Aba&s;ement does very well become all the Children of the fir&s;t Adam:</HI> and that even the <HI>be&s;t</HI> had need to take heed of Spiritual <HI>Pride,</HI> and be careful le&s;t in comparing them&s;elves with others, they be puffed up with Vain-Glory, while they reckon them&s;elves better than they.</P>
<P>IT is certain that Mankind have generally a great <HI>propen&s;ity</HI> this way. Such as enjoy extra|ordinary <HI>advantages,</HI> are apt to value them&s;elves too highly on the account of them, and to think that they have good <HI>qualifications</HI> an&s;werable to the Privileges, with which they are favoured; when perhaps it is far otherwi&s;e. And then be|ing puffed up in their own mind, they are apt to <HI>contemn</HI> and di&s;dain <HI>others,</HI> as tho' they were <HI>vile,</HI> compared with <HI>them.</HI> This was too much the temper and gui&s;e of the <HI>Jews,</HI> while they were lifted up to Heaven in Privileges. They reckoned them&s;elves a mo&s;t <HI>holy</HI> People, and E&s;teemed o|thers as <HI>unclean.</HI> In our <HI>Saviour's</HI> time and after it, they &s;eemed to think they had gotten the <HI>Monopo|ly</HI> of Religion, &s;o that others had &s;carce any the lea&s;t Share of it. Nay, they could &s;carce endure that the <HI>Gentiles</HI> &s;hould have the <HI>means</HI> of Salva|tion offered unto them. It is certain that &s;uch a temper as this is very offen&s;ive unto God: He ob&s;erved it with di&s;plea&s;ure in &s;ome of his own vi&s;ible People of Old, who &s;aid unto others. <HI>Stand by thy &s;elf, come not near me; for I am holier than thou.</HI> (<HI>I&s;a.</HI> 6<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.)

<HI>The&s;e are a &s;moke in my no&s;e, a fire that burneth all the day.</HI> There be &s;ome that live very Vicious Lives, and by their Sins expo&s;e them&s;elves unto God's Judgments; But <HI>what then,</HI> &s;aies the Apo&s;tle, <HI>are we,</HI> who are now reformed, <HI>any better than they? i.e.</HI> are we by nature &s;o? <HI>No, in no wi&s;e: We are all</HI> equally <HI>under Sin.</HI> Tho&s;e who would keep Spiritual Pride out of their Hearts, &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly <HI>con&s;ider this:</HI> and not forget, that if they do now at all <HI>differ</HI> from tho&s;e with whom they compare them&s;elves, it is GOD that has made them &s;o to do. Such thoughts have a natural tendency to keep Men humble and low in their own Eyes; which it's our duty and intere&s;t to be. We &s;hould <HI>not be High minded but fear,</HI> (Rom. 11. 20.) and take heed that we do not <HI>think our&s;elves &s;omething, when we are nothing, deceiving our own Souls.</HI> (Gal. 6 3.) But if we are indeed in any re&s;pect become better than others, let us not be proud of it, but &s;ay unto GOD, as in (<HI>P&s;al.</HI> 115. 1.) <HI>Not unto us</HI> O <HI>Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give Glory.</HI> And we &s;hould take the caution given us in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 7. partly before recited, <HI>what ha&s;t thou that thou did&s;t not receive? Now if thou did&s;t receive it, why doe&s;t thou glory as if thou had&s;t not received it?</HI></P>
<P>USE 5. WE may from the Doctrine di&s;cour&s;ed on, draw this conclu&s;ion, <HI>That the Sinfulne&s;s of any People ought not to be looked upon, as a &s;ufficient ground of di&s;couragment unto the People of God, from &s;etting upon, and diligently pro&s;ecuting proper me|thods, for their Conver&s;ion and Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>CHRISTIANS &s;hould con&s;ider, That being them&s;elves by nature as bad as the wor&s;t, if this
<PB N="24" REF="002677_0027_0FE606C024B19DA0">
had been &s;ufficient to di&s;courage others from at|tempting their Conver&s;ion, they might have per|haps &s;till remained &s;uch as by nature they were, and not have been made &s;uch as through the Grace of God, they are now become. But we ble&s;s God, we have not been thus dealt withal.</P>
<P>WHY then &s;hould we be di&s;couraged from en|deavouring the Salvation of others; tho' they at pre&s;ent appear to us to be as bad, as all Men by nature are, according to the account in the Word of God given of them.</P>
<P>MANY &s;uch have been Converted and Saved. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 1. <HI>Such were &s;ome of you, but ye are wa&s;hed, but ye are &s;anctified, but ye are ju&s;tified, in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the &s;pirit of our God.</HI> The Sovereign Grace of an Omnipotent God can cure the Blindne&s;s, and overcome the ob&s;tinacy of any People, and make them willing in the day of his Power. If he has done this for us, why &s;hould we be di&s;couraged from u&s;ing the proper means with others; that &s;o we may &s;ee what free and rich Grace will in this way do for them? And tho' we &s;hould not pre&s;ently di&s;cern &s;uch good effects of our Endeavours as we de&s;ire, we &s;hould not pre&s;ently give over our E&s;&s;ays to &s;ave our peri&s;hing Neighbours from Eternal ruin.</P>
<P>HERE I cannot but think it proper to make a more <HI>particular Application</HI> of what I am &s;aying under this Head unto the ca&s;e of a mi&s;erable People dwelling among us, and bordering upon us: I mean the Aboriginal <HI>Natives</HI> of this Land.</P>
<P>THE Preaching of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> unto many of the&s;e, and the Succe&s;s which it has had among
<PB N="25" REF="002677_0028_0FE6072F235F05F0">
them, has been formerly looked upon as none of the lea&s;t of the <HI>Glories</HI> of this Country, and GOD Himself has been Glorified on the account of it.</P>
<P>NOW, tho' this work was formerly carried on with much of Life and Vigour, yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;|&s;ed that there &s;eems not of Later Years &s;uch a Spirit among us to promote the good of the Indians: But on the Contrary, the work now goes on <HI>heavily,</HI> and many &s;eem to labour under di&s;couragements with re&s;pect to it; yea &s;ome will &s;peak as if there was &s;carce <HI>any good</HI> to be hoped for concern|ing the People here intended.</P>
<P>BUT why &s;hould we be &s;o di&s;couraged about them! They are no wor&s;e <HI>by nature</HI> than others, or than we our &s;elves. They are as <HI>capable Sub|jects</HI> of good impre&s;&s;ions, as the People of any o|ther Nation; And when it plea&s;eth God to ble&s;s means for their good, there are the <HI>&s;ame effects</HI> produced thereby, as the &s;ame means do produce on others.</P>
<P>I do not deny but that the number of &s;uch as are <HI>vicious</HI> among them is very great; but then I &s;hould not give God the Glory of his <HI>Grace</HI> ma|nife&s;ted in, and towards many of them, if I did not on this occa&s;ion &s;ay, That there are (to the Eye of Chri&s;tian Charity,) a <HI>con&s;iderable number</HI> of <HI>Godly</HI> People among them, And I do now de|clare, that I do not doubt but that there have been <HI>many hundreds</HI> (if I may not &s;ay &s;ome thou|&s;ands) of them &s;aved, &s;ince the fir&s;t Preaching of the Go&s;pel to them in this Land. There is &s;carce a Year pa&s;&s;eth, wherein there are not &s;ome, more or le&s;s, who as far as can be Judged, <HI>die</HI> in the Lord. I am confident it is &s;o with tho&s;e, with whom I am concerned; and I hope many are Saved in other Places al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="002677_0029_0FE606C1B27DC418">
I bear witne&s;s for God, that I do not perceive but that he as readily concurreth, by the operati|ons of his Spirit, with the means u&s;ed for the good of the <HI>Indians,</HI> as with tho&s;e enjoyed by any other People. Tho' it be true, that as he delights to work by means, &s;o the more <HI>&s;utable</HI> the means are, the more grounds we have to expect his ble&s;&s;ing to accompany them.</P>
<P>IN a word, I think we have no rea&s;on to be di&s;|couraged from pro&s;ecuting with utmo&s;t diligence, the good de&s;ign of Propagating the Go&s;pel among the <HI>Natives</HI> of this Land: And I take this oppor|tunity (which is a more <HI>Public</HI> one than I could ju&s;tly have expected,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Being a the Audience of the <HI>General Court.</HI></NOTE>) to intreat all &s;uch as are in any capacity for it, to endeavour a <HI>revival</HI> of this work, and a removal of the things that do impede the &s;ucce&s;sful carrying of it on; yea and diligently to con&s;ider what further way and means may be u&s;ed for the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful management of it.</P>
<P>THE Honourable COMMISSIONERS for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel among the <HI>Indians,</HI> will doubtle&s;s think them&s;elves very deeply con|cerned herein. And I here crave leave humbly, and with the greate&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion to &s;ay, That I believe this to be an Affair worthy of the &s;erious con&s;ideration of the <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>General COURT, or A&s;&s;embly</HI> of this <HI>Province,</HI> and I am per&s;waded that &s;ome things might yet be done by the <HI>Government</HI> here, which would have a very favourable a&s;pect on this work.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="002677_0030_0FE606CCAE9D9030">
I conclude this head, with asking the <HI>Prayers</HI> of my Hearers, That the Ble&s;&s;ing of God may accompany all the means that are u&s;ed for the good of the <HI>Indians;</HI> and that <HI>He</HI> would plea&s;e to direct all tho&s;e that are more immediately con|cerned with and for them, unto &s;uch mea&s;ures as may be mo&s;t conducive to that end. I have frequently heard our Chri&s;tian <HI>Indians</HI> praying fervently for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Churches and Mini&s;ters here, and el&s;e where: And I hope we &s;hall not neglect to pray for them al&s;o. Let us intreat the Lord on their behalf, that his Spirit may be poured upon them from on high whereby of a <HI>Wil|derne&s;s</HI> they may be made a <HI>Fruitful Field;</HI> and that they may yet be a People formed for him to &s;hew forth his prai&s;e, and that he would plea&s;e to &s;ay concerning them, that he will <HI>&s;et his Sanctu|ary in the midst of them,</HI>&mdash;and that his <HI>Taber|nacle &s;hall be with them,</HI> yea that he will be <HI>their God,</HI> and that they &s;hall be <HI>his People!</HI></P>
<P>USE 6 <HI>and la&s;t.</HI> IF Mankind be all in &s;uch a Sinful and Mi&s;erable E&s;tate, as has been declared, <HI>&s;hould we not all of us be greatly concerned, that we may not fail of getting out of it!</HI> It is a mo&s;t dread|ful thing to be <HI>under Sin,</HI> under the Guilt and reigning power of it. We have all of us rea&s;on to cry out, as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 24. <HI>O wretched men that we are! Who &s;hall deliver us from the body of this Death.</HI> And we &s;hould give our &s;elves no re&s;t, till we have attained unto &s;ome comfortable a&s;&s;urance, that we are delivered from the Guilt and Dominion of Sin, and are able to rejoyce as <HI>not being under the Law but under Grace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="002677_0031_0FE6073B27309F90">
WE &s;hould look upon <HI>Sin,</HI> unto which we are naturally &s;ubject, as the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> of all <HI>Evils;</HI> that <HI>abominable thing which God hateth;</HI> and the pro|curing cau&s;e of all the penal or afflictive evils that do or can befall us: And we &s;hould ble&s;s God for &s;ending his SON, the Lord from Heaven, to redeem us from our Sins; and ble&s;s <HI>Him</HI> for <HI>un|dertaking</HI> the admirable work of our Redemption. We &s;hould al&s;o be very thankful that the way of Salvation by a Redeemer is <HI>revealed</HI> unto us in the Go&s;pel, and &s;hould all of us be deeply concerned, that we <HI>receive not the Grace of God in vain.</HI> As all Mankind are by nature equally under Sin, &s;o they &s;hould be all equally concerned to get deli|verance from it. This is a concern which none may think them&s;elves <HI>too high for;</HI> and which the <HI>meane&s;t</HI> per&s;ons are invited to attend.</P>
<P>LET us then every one of us look to our &s;elves, <HI>giving all diligence to make our calling and election &s;ure.</HI> Let us be <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> in how bad an e&s;tate we by nature are: And let us abhor our &s;elves for all our Sins, and repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes. And let us prize Je&s;us Christ, who &s;aveth his People from their Sins, and let us repair unto him for Salva|tion: Flying for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope &s;et before us.</P>
<P>I Conclude with that good and comfortable word, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 56, 57. <HI>The &s;ting of Death is Sin, and the &s;trength of Sin is the Law: but thanks be unto God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
