<P>Hear the Word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his Word; your Brethren that hated you, and ca&s;t you out for my Name's Sake, &s;aid, Let the LORD be glorified, but HE &s;hall appear to your Joy, and they &s;hall be a&s;hamed.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>O WHAT comfortable Words are the&s;e! Words &s;ufficient to chear the Hearts of the Mourners, and to cau&s;e the Outca&s;ts to rejoice. Here is an Invitation to tho&s;e who trem|ble at the Word of the LORD, they are called to hearken to the chearing Voice of their GOD, who promi&s;es to appear to their Joy, and to the Shame of their Brethren, who ca&s;t them out, under a Pretence of glorifying GOD thereby.</P>
<P>Let us in the fir&s;t Place inquire into the Characters of tho&s;e who are &s;poken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the Words of my Text; they are &s;uch as <HI>tremble at the Word of the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P>We read in Ezra, x. 3, of tho&s;e who trembled at the Com|mandment of GOD. The&s;e are &s;uch as believe the Truth of GOD with their whole Hearts, who feel the Power of the &s;ame within their Brea&s;ts; who loathe them&s;elves on the Ac|count of their Iniquities, and live &s;o under a Sen&s;e of the Ma|je&s;ty of GOD, that they are continually aba&s;ed and humbled before him. Per&s;ons of this Character are very dear to GOD, as we find written in P&s;alm xxxiv. 18. "The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken Heart; and &s;aveth &s;uch as be of a contrite Spirit," and in P&s;alm li. 17, "The Sa|crifices of GOD are a broken Spirit; a broken and a con|trite Heart, O GOD, thou wilt not de&s;pi&s;e," and P&s;alm cxxxviii. 6. "Though the LORD be high, yet hath he Re&s;pect unto the Lowly; but the Proud he knoweth afar off," and P&s;alm cxlvii. 3, "He healeth the broken in Heart, and bindeth up their Wounds," and in the 57th Chapter of this Prophecy of I&s;aiah, and 15th Ver&s;e, we read, "For thus &s;aith the high and lofty ONE that inhabiteth Eternity, who&s;e Name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy Place, with him al&s;o that is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the humble, and to revive the Heart of the contrite ones," and in the &s;econd Ver&s;e of this Chapter, we read "But to this Man will I look (or have
<PB N="4" REF="017803_0004_0FA31AAEC4229800">
Regard) even to him that is poor, and of a contrite Spirit, and trembleth at my Word."</P>
<P>And how often doth our Saviour &s;ay, <HI>"He that humbleth him|&s;elf &s;hall be exalted."</HI> Matt. xxiii, 12. Luke xiv. 11. xviii. 14. There is nothing &s;o contrary to God as a proud haughty Spi|rit, but he delights in the humble. Let us therefore humble our&s;elves under the mighty Hand of God, that he may exalt us in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e Time; yea, let us be clothed with Humility, for God re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nteth the Proud, and giveth Grace to the Humble&punc; I. Peter, v. 5, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The nearer Brings are to God, the more humble they are; and the farther from him, the prouder. A better In&s;tance to prove this can hardly be found than that of Michael the Archangel. Contending with the Devil (or Lucifer) he di&s;|puted about the Body of Mo&s;es, yet dur&s;t not bring a railing Accu&s;ation again&s;t him, but &s;aid, "The Lord rebuke thee. Jude, Ver. 9." But Satan is &s;aid to be the "Accu&s;er of the Brethren, which accu&s;ed them before GOD Day and Night. Rev. xii. 10." See Michael the nighe&s;t Being to GOD, and Lucifer the farthe&s;t from him; one filled with the profounde&s;t Humility, and the other with the mo&s;t daring Pride and In&s;o|lence; Michael not daring to bring a railing Accu&s;ation again&s;t the Devil him&s;elf, yet the Devil daring to accu&s;e the Brethren Day and Night before GOD. The Difference is amazing, and is a proper Looking Gla&s;s for us all. Pride is the Image of Satan, Humility the Image of Chri&s;t, in which all Beings &s;tand that are conformed to him, in Proportion as they are &s;o.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who tremble at the Word of the LORD, may be de&s;cribed in the following manner:</P>
<P>They feel the Power of it in their Hearts:</P>
<P>They believe every Word of GOD is true, and &s;hall have its Accompli&s;hment:</P>
<P>They fear to deny with the Mouth what they believe in the Heart&punc; even though the Confe&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame &s;hould expo&s;e them to the Scorn and Deri&s;ion of their Acquaintance:</P>
<P>They endeavour to be conformed, both in Temper and Conduct, to the Will of GOD made known to them; and to obey GOD rather than Men.</P>
<P>I think the&s;e are the true Marks of tho&s;e who tremble at the Word of GOD. Happy are they who an&s;wer this De|&s;cription!</P>
<P>Having very briefly de&s;cribed tho&s;e to whom the LORD &s;peaks, let as con&s;ider what he &s;aith, "Your Brethren that hated you, and ca&s;t you out for my Name's Sake, &amp;c."</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="017803_0005_0FA31AAF83331B68">We are a&s;&s;ured in the Sacred Pages, that Reproach and Per&s;ecution mu&s;t infallibly be every living Chri&s;tian's Lot; and the Saviour of Mankind has pronounced a Ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e who meet therewith for his S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke, &s;aying, "B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;ed are they which are per&s;ecuted for Righteou&s;ne&s;s Sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.

Luke vi. 22, 23."&mdash;And Je&s;us a&s;&s;ured his Di&s;ciples, that they mu&s;t continually expect Hatred, Calumny, and Per&s;ecution, from the Men of the World: S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me of his intimations of that Kind, I will repeat to you: "And ye &s;hall be hated of all Men for my Name's Sake, Matt. x. 22, xxiv, 9. Mark xiii, 13. Luke xxi, 17."&mdash;"It is enough for the Di&s;ciple, that he be as his Ma&s;ter, and the Servant as his Lord: If they have called the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e Beelzebub, how much more &s;hall they call them of his Hou&s;hold? Matt. x. 25."&mdash;"If the World hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the World, the World would love his own; but becau&s;e ye are not of the World, but I have cho&s;en you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you. Remember the Word that I &s;aid unto you. The Ser|vant is not greater than the Lord. If they have per&s;ecuted me, they will al&s;o per&s;ecute you; if they have kept my Say|ing, they will keep yours al&s;o. But all the&s;e Things will they do unto you for my Name's Sake, becau&s;e they know not him that &s;ent me. John xv. 18, 19, 20, 21."&mdash;"The&s;e Things I have &s;poken unto you, that ye &s;hould not be offended. They &s;hall put you out of the Synagogues, yea, the Time cometh that who&s;oever killeth you, will think that he doth GOD Service. In the World ye &s;hall have Tribulation. John xvi. 1, 2, 33."</P>
<P>And the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t experienced the&s;e Things, and taught all Chri&s;tians to expect the &s;ame. St. Paul, after &s;peaking of his own Trials (le&s;t any &s;hould think t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em pe|culiar to Paul and the Apo&s;tles) adds, "Yea, and all that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall &s;uffer Per&s;ecution.

II. Tim. iii, 12." And St. Peter &s;ays, "If ye be reproached for the Name of Chri&s;t happy are ye: For the Spirit of Glo|ry and of GOD re&s;teth on you. On their Part he is evil &s;poken of, but on your Part he is glorified. I. Pet. iv, l4."</P>
<P>And St. John ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erves, that "Cain was of that wicked one, and &s;lew his Brother; and wherefore &s;lew he him? (&s;aith he) Becau&s;e his own W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ks were evil, and his Brother's righteous." And then he adds, very pertinently, "Marvel not, my Brethren, if the World have you. I. John, iii. 12, 13." What St. Paul &s;aid concerning I&s;hmael the Mocker, remains &s;till as true as over, "But as then, he that was born after the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;h, per&s;ecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even &s;o it is now. Gal. iv, 29"</P>
<P>From the World we ate taught to expect Per&s;ecution; but our Text &s;ays, "Your Brethren that hated you, and ca&s;t you out for my Name's Sake, &s;aid, Let the Lord be glorified."</P>
<P>We have experienced &s;omething of what the Spou&s;e did; for &s;he &s;ays (Sol. So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gs. i. 6,) "My Mother's Children were angry with me." It has been the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unhappy Ca&s;e al|mo&s;t ever &s;ince Chri&s;tianity has been known in the World, that its Profe&s;&s;ors have been exceedingly divided in their Judgments, and not only &s;o, but they have reproached, re|vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, cen&s;ured and per&s;ecuted one another in the mo&s;t dread|ful Manner; many Times even to Death, and where they have not had that in their Power, they have often &s;hown by their bitter Words, hard Speeches, fal&s;e Accu&s;ations, and malicious Reproaches, what they would have done if they could. Strange as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may &s;eem, the be&s;t Profe&s;&s;ion in the World has been abu&s;ed, and made the Occa&s;ion of more War and Blood&s;hed in Chri&s;tendom, for many Centuries, than all other Things put together.</P>
<P>One great Cau&s;e of &s;o much unprofitable Contention is, that Truth has been divided, torn to Pieces, and &s;ometimes even lo&s;t in the Debates rai&s;ed about it; one Party has had &s;ome Truth, another has al&s;o had &s;ome, but each thinking they had the whole, have endeavoured to overthrow all that their Antagoni&s;ts held; both have been dividing the living Child of Truth, under a Notion that it was found no where but with them; and thus each have oppo&s;ed the Truth in each other, under the Notion of its being erroneous: On the contrary we &s;ay, that al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Denomination have it among them in Part, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e divided Parts brought together, ju&s;t make up that Collection of Truths that we believe.</P>
<P>I have often con&s;idered it with A&s;toni&s;hment, that two Mini&s;ters &s;hall preach, and prove what they &s;ay from the

Scriptures, and neither of them &s;hall be looked upon as hold|ing damnable Here&s;y, and yet we &s;hall be looked upon as the wor&s;t of Hereticks by both of them, and all their People, for believing only what both of them put together have a&s;|&s;erted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I was in Company once with two public Speakers, one of them &s;aid that he believed as much as he did his own Ex|i&s;tence, that God loved all, and that Chri&s;t died for all, without Exception; the other &s;aid that nothing was more evi|dent to him than this, viz. that Chri&s;t could not die in vain for any, that he mu&s;t &s;ee of the Travail of his Sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and be &s;atisfied, and that all for whom the Saviour died, mu&s;t be fi|nally made happy; now could each of the&s;e have believed tho&s;e Truths which the other held as inconte&s;tible, they would have held Things as we do immediately, for we be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">e firm|ly what both of them put together did; and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e is it po&s;&s;ible that we are Hereticks, for believi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion Principles of the whole Chri&s;tian World, I leave every one to judge!</NOTE></P>
<P>One will &s;ay, GOD loves all his Cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tures without Excep|tion, that he is good to all, and his tender Mercies are over all his Works; the other will maintain that all the Obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his Love mu&s;t finally come to the Enjoyment of him&s;elf; and that his Mercy endureth for ever, and cannot fail. We heartily believe both the&s;e Te&s;timonies.</P>
<P>One will a&s;&s;ert that, Chri&s;t died for all, ta&s;ted Death for every one; the other, that Chri&s;t &s;hall &s;ee of the Travail of his Soul, and &s;hall be &s;atisfied, and that all for whom his Blood was &s;ired, &s;hall be clean&s;ed thereby: All this we &s;ted|fa&s;tly believe.</P>
<P>One will declare that GOD willeth that all &s;hall be &s;aved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth; the other, that whatever GOD willeth, mu&s;t be accompli&s;hed at la&s;t.</P>
<P>None can &s;ay with Truth, that we deny either of the&s;e A&s;|&s;ertions.</P>
<P>One will &s;ay that GOD at fir&s;t purpo&s;ed all his Creatures to prai&s;e and glorify his Name to all Eternity, and to be hap|py in the Enjoyment of him&s;elf; the other will declare that the Purpo&s;es of GOD mu&s;t &s;tand, that with GOD there is no Variablene&s;s, nor Shadow of Turning, that he is of one Mind, and that none can turn him, and that what his Soul de&s;ireth, that he doth: We freely con&s;ent to the Truth of all this.</P>
<P>One will &s;ay that GOD would &s;ave all if he could, that his
<PB N="8" REF="017803_0008_0FA31AB1C31A47F0">
Will is good towards all; the other will a&s;&s;ert, that he is in|finitely able to do all that he plea&s;es, and that he could bring all to him if he would.</P>
<P>And do not we as fully believe both of the&s;e Po&s;itions, as we do our own Exi&s;tence?</P>
<P>One will declare that the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t was freely &s;hed for all; the other, that his Blood is infinitely &s;ufficient to clean&s;e and purity all. This is what we believe.</P>
<P>One will &s;ay, with the Scripture that all Things are given to Chri&s;t; the other, in Conformity to the &s;ame &s;acred Writ|tings, will maintain, that all that the Father giveth him &s;hall come to him; that he will give eternal Life to as many as the Father has given him. This is our Belief. We believe the Truth of both tho&s;e Po&s;itions. None will come to Chri&s;t but tho&s;e whom the Father giveth him; and he hath given him all Things without Exception. Thus we &s;ee that our Belief is in Fact the Belief of all the Chri&s;tian World put to|gether. And in&s;tead of tending to increa&s;e the divided Churches, it tends to unite them all in one, as it allows the Truth in a Mea&s;ure among&s;t all, and that as there is no Church wholly pure in all Things, &s;o none can be found but what has &s;ome true Witne&s;&s;es for God therein; &s;ome Tokens of the Divine Pre&s;ence, and &s;ome glorious Truths remain in every Church under the Sun; and this glorious Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of Truths that, we believe, bids fair one Day to unite all together in one clo&s;e Sy&s;tem of Benevolence; and it is my Opinion that the Time is not very remote, when "Zion's Watchmen &s;hall &s;ee Eye to Eye. When we &s;hall not need to teach every Man his Neighbour, &s;aying, Know the LORD, for all &s;hall know him from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t, and &s;erve him with one Con&s;ent."</P>
<P>Our Belief re&s;pecting the Re&s;toration of all Things is not only founded upon the plaine&s;t Letter of Scripture (as all may &s;ee, who will be at the Pains to read over the printed Col|lection of Texts) but is exactly according to the Experience of every Chri&s;tian. For let me a&s;k any who were ever made to experience the Love of God &s;hed abroad in their Hearts, by the Holy Gho&s;t, the&s;e Que&s;tions: Did you not a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that Time &s;ee, and feel your&s;elves the vile&s;t of all Sinners, even the mo&s;t &s;tubborn and rebellious of the human Race?</P>
<P>Did you not view the Love of God infinitely full, free, unmerited, and unde&s;erved? Did you not behold in Chri&s;t an infinite Fulne&s;s, Sufficiency and Willingne&s;s to &s;ave all? Did you not earne&s;tly long that all might come and partake of his Grace? If you had had as much Power as good Will, would you not have brought all to bow to the Sceptre of Grace,

"For the Gifts and Call|ing of God are without Repentance. Rom. xi. 29."</P>
<P>Now if we attend to the plain Letter of the Scripture, we &s;hall find that GOD hath declared that he will <HI>"make all Things new</HI>; that he will gather together in Chri&s;t all Things both in Heaven and on Earth; even in him who having made Peace, through the Blood of his Cro&s;s, &s;hall have that great Honour to reconcile all Things to GOD, both which are in Heaven and on Earth; yea, he hath &s;worn by him&s;elf, that to him every Knee &s;hall bow, every Tongue &s;hall &s;wear."

O what a glorious Day will that be! The di&s;tant Thought of which fills us with the greate&s;t Joy and Satisfaction. If "there it Joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth," what unknown, what inconceivable Joy &s;hall there be when all that have &s;inned again&s;t their great Creator, &s;hall repent, acknowledge him to be wholly ju&s;t, and them&s;elves entirely to blame, fall at his Feet, and &s;wear Allegiance to their righteous Sovereign; never more to rebel again&s;t him to all Eternity! O glorious Period, when the Chordage of all Hearts &s;hall be taken in Hand by GOD him&s;elf, and tuned to his never cea&s;ing Prai&s;e!</P>
<P>But could we believe that Sin and Mi&s;ery &s;hould endure to all Eternity, that the ble&s;&s;ed God, worthy of all Prai&s;e, from all Intelligences, &s;hould be hated by va&s;t Numbers of the Beings he hath made capable of loving and &s;erving him, and that to all endle&s;s Ages, we &s;hould be filled with the greate&s;t Sorrow imaginable! For even when we &s;ee poor mi&s;erable Wretches, under the Power and Government of Satan, pro|phaning and bla&s;pheming the Name of God, it fills our Hearts with Grief inexpre&s;&s;ible; how inconceivable would our Di&s;tre&s;s then be, if we could be made to believe, that they mu&s;t, to all endle&s;s Ages, continue in Rage, Bla&s;phemy, and De&s;pair! But Glory to God in the highe&s;t, we believe that the Wi&s;dom, Power, and Goodne&s;s, of the ever adorable JEHOVAH &s;hall &s;hine mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly, in the entire De|&s;truction of all Evil, and total Subjection, and complete Re|&s;toration of all his Creatures. "We believe, and therefore we &s;peak." Great is our Joy; though we are de&s;pi&s;ed, re|jected, and treated with Contempt by many for the Go&s;pel's Sake which we believe, yet we would not part with the Sa|tisfaction we find therein, for all the Glories of the World, and the Applau&s;e of all Mankind.</P>
<P>Many &s;ay, "What need have we to care about what be|comes of others? If we are happy our&s;elves, that is all that we need to &s;eek after, or be concerned about." This Lan|guage well enough becomes tho&s;e that have a Religion found|ed in Selfi&s;hne&s;s, or tho&s;e who have narrow Notions and Ideas of God's Love, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be confined to them and their Party; but it is as oppo&s;ite to the true Spirits of Chri&s;|tianity, and the Language of tho&s;e who dwell in "Love, and dwell in God," as Darkne&s;s is to Light, Evil to Good, or Satan to Chri&s;t.

royal Law, "Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy&s;elf."

<P>The Nature of Grace leads us to de&s;ire the Happine&s;s of all our fellow Creatures; this is known to all experienced Chri&s;|tians; and I &s;uppo&s;e that the Joy in Heaven will continue increa&s;ing, as the divine Work of the Re&s;toration goes on, and will not come to its highe&s;t Pitch, till every Creature in the Univer&s;e &s;hall be brought willingly to &s;ubmit to Je&s;us, and be made happy in his Love.</P>
<P>This is our Belief for which we have &s;uffered Reproach, and Cen&s;ure from our Brethren; for this we are called Here|ticks. Deceivers, deceived ones, &amp;c.

<P>We have experienced what it is to be hated and ca&s;t out by our Brethren, for the Name of the Lord, for the Sake of the dear Saviour, and the Te&s;timony that we hold.

<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be God, we tru&s;t the Time is at Hand, when the Lord will appear more abundantly to our Joy, and cau&s;e his Power to be known through the Earth, when he will build up Zion, and appear in his Glory, and de&s;troy Anti|christ with the Spirit of his Mouth, and the Brightne&s;s of his Appearing, and &s;pread the glorious Go&s;pel of his u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|ver&s;al Love and Power, through the Earth; and cau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ble&s;&s;ed Doctrine now &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed, to be heard and received from Pole to Pole, and the whole World to &s;ubmit to the Saviour of Mankind, who died to re&s;tore all to God again. Will not tho&s;e then be a&s;hamed, who have hated us, and ca&s;t us out for the Belief of God's univer&s;al Love, when the Knowledge thereof &s;hall be as univer&s;al as the Light of the Sun?</P>
<P>But, oh, when Chri&s;t &s;hall appear to judge the World, what Account will they be able to give him of their Conduct towards us? He will then put to Silence the ignorant Cavils, and hard Speeches of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, who have &s;et them&s;elves again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> his Truth. Will they be able to an&s;wer him, when he &s;hall &s;ay, "Who hath required this at your Hands?" But God is good, and ju&s;t, and therefore to him we would refer the whole Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter,</P>
<P>I &s;hall now clo&s;e the whole with an Addre&s;s to you, who have been hated and ca&s;t out by your Brethren, for the glo|rious Cau&s;e of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Profe&s;&s;ion of his Go&s;pel of univer&s;al Love; called "damnable Here&s;y" by many.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="address">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Brethren and Si&s;ters,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>You have been highly favoured of the Lord, not only in having experienced the Truth in your Hearts, but in being called to &s;tand as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itne&s;&s;es of the everla&s;ting, univer&s;al, re|&s;toring Love, and Power of our dear Saviour. You have al|ready &s;uffered much of your Brethren, and have been rejected by them. Thanks to the Providence of God, we live in a Country where we are allowed to wor&s;hip according to our own Con&s;ciences, and none can hinder us.</P>
<P>But though we may not expect to meet with Impri&s;on|ment, Bani&s;hment, Confi&s;cation of Goods or Death, at pre|&s;ent; yet we may expect, as we have already experienced, what the Apo&s;tle Paul calls "cruel Mockings," Reproaches, Revilings, Slanders, Cen&s;ures, and the unbounded Rage
<PB N="18" REF="017803_0018_0FA31AB9436D1EF8">
and Per&s;ecution of the Tongue; which is frequently wor&s;e to bear than Death it&s;elf, as the Experience of many te&s;ti|fies, and therefore it is called by St. Paul "cruel," in Preference to all other Kinds of Sufferings.</P>
<P>Arm your&s;elves therefore continually with Humility, Meek|ne&s;s, univer&s;al Benevolence, and unfeigned Re&s;ignation to the Will of God; and then you will not only be able to bear all that the Rage and Malice of Men can ca&s;t upon you, with Patience, but will be able to repay them all with loving Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t expect, that the Adver&s;ary of Mankind will try his utmo&s;t to draw you off from the Truth; for he is loth to have it known in the World, that he is a conquered Potentate, and that his Kingdom mu&s;t one Day be entirely de&s;troyed; and as he has for a long Time kept the Doctrine of the final Re&s;toration of all Things, hid and covered, &s;o you may ex|pect he will greatly rage again&s;t it now it begins again to ap|pear. But fear not my Brethren, the Cau&s;e is God's, and not ours; let us commit our&s;elves into his Hands, who is able to keep us from falling, and to give us the Victory over the Powers of Darkne&s;s, through the Blood of the Lamb, and the Word of our Te&s;timony.</P>
<P>Finally, as our Religion calls us to the greate&s;t Purity and Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine&s;s imaginable, even to be clothed with the Image and Nature of Chri&s;t, let us endeavour to enter into the Spirit of the Go&s;pel continually, that we may grow more and more into the Likene&s;s of the Saviour, that when he &s;hall appear, we may rejoice in his coming, and not be a&s;hamed.</P>
