<HEAD>The Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the Dead who die in LORD.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>REV. XIV. 13.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>AND I heard a Voice from Heaven, &s;aying to me, write, Ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead which die in the LORD from henceforth: Yea, &s;aith the SPIRIT, that they may re&s;t from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE <HI>Manner</HI> in which the&s;e Words are introduced be&s;peaks a more than ordi|nary Attention. <HI>I heard a Voice from Heaven.</HI> i. e. from GOD out of Heaven: And it was a Voice di&s;tinctly articulated in its Sound, like the Voice at our SAVIOUR's <HI>Bap|ti&s;m</HI> and <HI>Transfiguration;</HI> a Voice that &s;pake to the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> in plain and intelligible Words, com|manding him, not meerly to pronounce, but to <HI>write,</HI> the Dead in CHRIST ble&s;&s;ed. For &s;o it fol|lows, <HI>Saying unto me, Write, Ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead which die in the LORD from henceforth.</HI> Like Words of Support and Con&s;olation to the Saints of the mo&s;t High, both <HI>living</HI> and <HI>dying,</HI> are &s;carce to be met with any where in the Bible. The <HI>Dead in</HI> CHRIST, it is true, are frequently &s;poken of as

<HI>ble&s;&s;ed;</HI> but, perhaps, never with &s;o much Particu|larity, with &s;uch &s;pecial Marks of Honour and Di|&s;tinction. And yet, this is not all: For the <HI>Divine</HI> SPIRIT is him&s;elf introduced, expre&s;ly and &s;olemnly te&s;tifying that they are thus ble&s;&s;ed, and particularly &s;pecifying the <HI>In&s;tances</HI> wherein they are &s;o; <HI>Yea, &s;aith the SPIRIT, that they may re&s;t from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</HI></P>
<P>In the Words, the three following Things are ob&s;ervable, not improper to employ our pre&s;ent Meditations.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>A De&s;cription of the Per&s;ons</HI> here pronounced ble&s;&s;ed; <HI>the Dead who die in the LORD.</HI></ITEM>

</LIST>
<P>Accordingly, the&s;e are the Heads we &s;hall di|&s;tinctly illu&s;trate, and then <HI>apply</HI> what may be offer|ed in &s;ome &s;utable Reflections.</P>
<P>I. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Thing ob&s;ervable in the Text is, <HI>A De&s;cription of the Per&s;ons pronounced ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> And the&s;e are the <HI>Dead:</HI> Not the Dead without Di&s;cri|mination, but <HI>the Dead who die in the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>But, you will a&s;k, Who are the&s;e? Who are the Per&s;ons meant by <HI>the Dead who die in the LORD,</HI> concerning whom it is here declared, that they are <HI>ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> In an&s;wer whereto,</P>
<P>Some &s;ay, that the holy <HI>Martyrs,</HI> tho&s;e who have &s;uffered Death for the <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Sake</HI> of the LORD
<PB N="7" REF="006298_0005_1028847F817DC660">
JESUS CHRIST, are the Per&s;ons more e&s;pecially in|tended. <HI>Who die in the LORD,</HI> i. e. for the LORD, for his Sake, in Defence of his Cau&s;e, and to bear Te&s;timony to the Truth of his Go&s;pel. So &s;ome expound the Phra&s;e: In which Sen&s;e, it mu&s;t be owned, it is &s;ometimes taken in Scripture; as in <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 1. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 14. (according to the Ori|ginal) and in &s;everal other Places; which it is need|le&s;s to turn you to. And, to be &s;ure, tho&s;e who &s;uffer for Righteou&s;ne&s;s Sake, who die in the Cau&s;e of CHRIST, 'not counting their Lives dear to them', &s;o that they may honour their Saviour, and the Truths pertaining to his Kingdom, are not to be excluded a Share in the <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> the Text &s;peaks of: Though there does not appear &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to determine, that the&s;e are the only Per&s;ons here intended.</P>
<P>Others therefore interpret the Words more gene|rally, as including not only <HI>Confe&s;&s;ors</HI> and <HI>Martyrs,</HI> but <HI>all good Chri&s;tians. Who die in the LORD,</HI> i. e. in the Faith of the LORD JESUS, united to him, and intere&s;ted in the Mercy of GOD through him. In this Sen&s;e they under&s;tand the Phra&s;e: And with good Rea&s;on; for it &s;eems to be of the &s;ame Import with tho&s;e Phra&s;es, <HI>the Dead in CHRIST,</HI> tho&s;e that are <HI>fallen a&s;leep in JESUS,</HI> which are un|doubtedly made u&s;e of as de&s;criptive of <HI>&s;incere Chri|&s;tians</HI> in common.</P>
<P>And we &s;hall the more ea&s;ily conceive of the Propriety of this Mode of Speech to point out <HI>good Men,</HI> if we call to mind, that <HI>they</HI> are not infre|quently, in the Writings of the New-Te&s;tament, characteri&s;ed from their <HI>being in CHRIST.</HI> Agree|able whereto is that Language, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iv. 17. 'If any Man be <HI>in</HI> CHRIST, he is a new Creature'. And again, <HI>Chap.</HI> xii. Ver. 2. 'I knew a Man <HI>in</HI> CHRIST'.
<PB N="8" REF="006298_0006_10288481087EFCE0">
And yet again, <HI>Philip.</HI> iii. 8, 9.&mdash;'I count all Things but Lo&s;s,&mdash;that I may win CHRIST, and be found <HI>in him.</HI>'</P>
<P>There is indeed a <HI>being in CHRIST</HI> that is com|mon to all that are Members of that vi&s;ible King|dom, of which he is Head and Lord, whether they are Chri&s;tians in <HI>Truth,</HI> or in <HI>Pretence</HI> only. Hence the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> when mentioning the Churches of <HI>Judea</HI> (in which there were doubtle&s;s a Number of meer <HI>nominal</HI> Chri&s;tians) u&s;es that Style 'which were <HI>in</HI> CHRIST'<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Gal. i. 22.</NOTE>. And our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour expre&s;|ly &s;peaks of 'Branches <HI>in him</HI> which bear no Fruit'<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xv. 2.</NOTE>. And makes that Suppo&s;ition,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Ver. 6.</NOTE> 'If a Man abide not <HI>in me,</HI> he is ca&s;t forth as a Branch, and is wi|thered: And Men gather them, and ca&s;t them into the Fire; and they are burned'.</P>
<P>But this notwith&s;tanding, there is a <HI>being in CHRIST</HI> that is <HI>peculiar to good Men,</HI> and certainly de&s;criptive of their Character as &s;uch. And this indeed is that <HI>being in CHRIST,</HI> or <HI>Union to him,</HI> that is &s;o much celebrated in Scripture, and &s;et forth under &s;uch a Variety of &s;trong and lively Re|&s;emblances. It is compared to the Union between <HI>Hu&s;band</HI> and <HI>Wife,</HI> which is &s;o near and intimate that they are no longer <HI>twain,</HI> but <HI>one Fle&s;h</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xix. 5.</NOTE>.&mdash;It is compared to the Union of a <HI>Building,</HI> in which the &s;everal Parts, being fitly framed, are &s;o joined together as to con&s;titute <HI>one Hou&s;e;</HI> of which Hou&s;e, CHRIST, in the Similitude, is the <HI>Foundation,</HI> or chief <HI>Corner-Stone</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 4, 5, 6.</NOTE>.&mdash;It is compared to the Uni|on of the <HI>Body</HI> with the <HI>Head,</HI> in Con&s;equence whereof it 'maketh Increa&s;e, and groweth up <HI>into him,</HI> in all Things, which is the Head, even

CHRIST'<NOTE N="*&verbar;&verbar;" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 15, 16.</NOTE>.&mdash;It is compared to the Union of a <HI>Vine</HI> and its <HI>Branches;</HI> and the Analogy is &s;o ex|act, that 'as the Branch cannot bear Fruit of it &s;elf, except it abide in the Vine; &s;o neither can <HI>they,</HI> ex|cept they abide <HI>in him</HI>'<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. xv. 4, 5.</NOTE>.&mdash;It is compared to the Union between GOD and CHRIST; and <HI>they,</HI> in the Compari&s;on, are &s;aid to be <HI>in him,</HI> and <HI>he in them,</HI> in &s;ome Sen&s;e analogous to that in which <HI>he</HI> is <HI>in the Father,</HI> and the <HI>Father in him</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Joh. xvii. 21, 22, 23.</NOTE>.&mdash;In a Word, <HI>They</HI> are, according to the Scriptures, <HI>united to him,</HI> and <HI>&s;o in him,</HI> as to be <HI>transformed into the &s;ame Image,</HI> and to <HI>partake of the &s;ame &s;piritual Na|ture</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vi. 17.</NOTE>.&mdash;They are <HI>&s;o in him</HI> as to derive from him tho&s;e Supplies of Grace, whereby they are made 'compleat <HI>in him,</HI> who is the Head of all Princi|pality and Power'<NOTE N="&verbar;&verbar; &verbar;&verbar;" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 10.</NOTE>.&mdash;Yea, they are <HI>&s;o in him</HI> as to become intere&s;ted in what he has done, and &s;uf|fered, and is now doing in Heaven, at the Right Hand of GOD, on the Behalf of Sinners<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Eph. i. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And wherein could good Chri&s;tians be better di|&s;tingui&s;hed? Their being thus &s;poken of as <HI>in</HI> CHRIST is an infallible Mark, di&s;criminating them from all others.</P>
<P>And the&s;e now are the Per&s;ons intended by the <HI>Dead that die in the LORD.</HI> They are tho&s;e, and only tho&s;e, who, while alive, were <HI>&s;o united to</HI> CHRIST as that they 'abode in him, and his Words in them'? They are tho&s;e who were &s;o <HI>in</HI> CHRIST, as that they derived &s;uch Influences from him whereby they were enabled to bring forth the Fruits of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, in a Conver&s;ation becoming the Go&s;pel of CHRIST. Of all &s;uch, and of &s;uch only, it may be &s;aid, while they live, that they live <HI>in</HI> CHRIST;
<PB N="10" REF="006298_0008_10288485A91011D8">
and when they die, that they die <HI>in</HI> CHRIST. And <HI>ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>Voice from Heaven,</HI> in my Text, <HI>are the Dead that thus die in the LORD.</HI> And this leads</P>
<P>II. To the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Thing ob&s;ervable in the Words, which is, <HI>A &s;pecial Notification of the Time, when the Dead in CHRIST &s;hall enter upon this Ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s;</HI> &s;ignified by that Phra&s;e, <HI>from henceforth.</HI> In the Original, it is <HI>aparti;</HI> which is an Expre&s;&s;ion that will admit of &s;everal Sen&s;es. Among others, it may well be con&s;trued in this,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Lowman's</HI> Paraphra&s;e in Loc. Note e.</NOTE> which &s;pecifies the Time when the Dead in CHRIST commence ble&s;&s;ed. 'Ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead, that die in the LORD, <HI>from henceforth</HI>'. As if it had been &s;aid, '<HI>from that Time</HI> they are ble&s;&s;ed. They are no &s;ooner Dead than they are ble&s;&s;ed. They enter upon a State of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in&s;tantly upon their Death'. The Words are certainly capable of being thus un|der&s;tood; and this, probably is the very Sen&s;e in which they ought to be interpreted: To be &s;ure, it is a Sen&s;e that falls in with the <HI>Truth of Fact,</HI> in re|&s;pect of all the <HI>Dead that die in the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Bodies,</HI> it is true, 'return to the Du&s;t from whence they were taken'; but not &s;o their <HI>Spirits.</HI> The&s;e 'a&s;cend up to GOD who gave them': And this <HI>immediately</HI> upon their Death. <HI>From henceforth,</HI> we may &s;ay, they are ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Spirits</HI> do not go to a <HI>Place of Purgation,</HI> in order to their being fitted for the <HI>paradi&s;aick</HI> State; as is the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> Neither do they <HI>&s;leep</HI> with their Bodies, till the ge|neral Re&s;urrection; as is the Opinion of others, who, tho' they profe&s;s a Regard to the Scriptures, yet
<PB N="11" REF="006298_0009_1028848C29FD34E0">
explain them &s;o as to con&s;i&s;t with their own private Notions: Much le&s;s &s;till do they <HI>peri&s;h</HI> at Death, &s;inking into a State of <HI>Non-exi&s;tence;</HI> as is the Pre|tence of tho&s;e, who are &s;tyled, in the &s;acred Lan|guage, 'wi&s;e Men after the Fle&s;h'.</P>
<P>If we may give Credit to the Revelations of <HI>Scripture,</HI> there is no Room for Doubt, whether the <HI>Soul</HI> &s;urvives the Funeral of the <HI>Body:</HI> Nor can it rea&s;onably remain a Que&s;tion, Whether tho&s;e, <HI>who die in the LORD,</HI> do immediately pa&s;s into Glory? The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> certainly thought, that good Men were happy <HI>in&s;tantly</HI> upon their Death. For with him, is re&s;pect of all &s;incere Chri&s;tians, 'to die is Gain'; 'to be ab&s;ent from the Body, is to be pre&s;ent with the LORD'; and 'to depart hence, is to be with CHRIST, which is by far better than to abide in the Fle&s;h'. And our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR him&s;elf, in the <HI>Parable</HI> of the <HI>Rich Man</HI> and <HI>Lazarus,</HI> repre&s;ents <HI>Lazarus,</HI> upon his dying, as <HI>immediately</HI> 'carried by the Angels into <HI>Abraham's Bo&s;om</HI>'; by which he means a Place of ineffable Happine&s;s. And it is ob&s;ervable, what he here &s;ays of <HI>Lazarus</HI> is exhibited as an <HI>Example</HI> of what will be the Ca&s;e of all <HI>who die in</HI> CHRIST: The holy Angels of GOD will take into Cu&s;tody their de|parting Spirits, and convoy them &s;afe to &s;ome Place of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, in the future World.</P>
<P>And this <HI>Scripture-Repre&s;entation</HI> of the Matter is far more agreeable to <HI>true Philo&s;ophy,</HI> than that which makes Death, either a <HI>total De&s;truction</HI> of our Being, or the bringing us into a State of <HI>In&s;en&s;ibility.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Death,</HI> con&s;idered as the <HI>De&s;truction</HI> of our ratio|nal and moral Powers, is an incredible Thing, if viewed in the Light of <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> We have in Na|ture no Example of &s;uch De&s;truction. What we
<PB N="12" REF="006298_0010_1028848F132E9560">
call the <HI>De&s;truction of material Beings</HI> is, properly &s;peaking, nothing more than a <HI>Change of their Form.</HI> And if, in re&s;pect of <HI>unperceiving</HI> Beings, there is no De&s;truction; but only a <HI>Change</HI> in the <HI>Mode</HI> of their Exi&s;tence: Why &s;hould it be thought, that a <HI>total End</HI> is put to <HI>perceiving</HI> Beings, much le&s;s to <HI>intelligent moral</HI> ones, upon &s;uch an Appearance as Death? This cannot be argued from <HI>Analogy:</HI> For there is nothing &s;imilar to it, that we know of, in all the Revolutions of Nature.&mdash;It certainty looks more rational to conclude, that, in re&s;pect of &s;uch thinking moral Beings as Men are, a <HI>Change</HI> only is introduced by Death, as to the <HI>Manner</HI> of their Communication with this &s;en&s;ible and material World.&mdash;Be&s;ides, it does not reflect Honour on the infinitely benevolent Creator and Ruler of the World, to &s;uppo&s;e him putting a Period, at Death, to the Exi&s;tence of rational moral Beings; e&s;pecially, tho&s;e among them, who, by a wi&s;e Improvement of their Powers, have enlarged their Capacities for Hap|pine&s;s. We can ea&s;ily conceive GOD to be good, and as exerci&s;ing Goodne&s;s, and the greate&s;t Good|ne&s;s upon the whole, when the Con&s;titution of Things is &s;uch, as that, according to certain &s;tated Laws, there &s;hall be a <HI>Change</HI> in moral Beings, as to the <HI>Manner</HI> of their Exi&s;tence, and the Exertment of their &s;everal Powers: But the Con&s;i&s;tency be|tween Goodne&s;s, in an infinitely benevolent Creator and Governour, and the <HI>total peri&s;hing</HI> of moral Be|ings; e&s;pecially &s;uch as have behaved well, does not &s;o readily appear to the humane Mind. To be &s;ure, it gives us, at be&s;t, but a low dimini&s;hed Idea of the Benevolence of GOD, to view him as <HI>de&s;troy|ing moral Agents,</HI> capable of Happine&s;s, and growing in their Capacity and Meetne&s;s for it, after &s;o &s;hort and momentany an Exi&s;tence as our's mu&s;t be, if there is an End of it at Death.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="006298_0011_102884D18A73C800">
In like Manner, Death, con&s;idered as &s;inking Men into a <HI>Stupor,</HI> and thereby rendring their thinking Powers u&s;ele&s;s and inactive, though it be only till the <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> is a Notion that can no more be ju&s;tified by <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> What may have led to this Apprehen&s;ion, and is indeed the only Thing that can, with any Colour, give Credit to it, is the cea&s;|ing of that <HI>&s;tated Order,</HI> at Death, according to which the humane Mind has Communication, by Means of a wi&s;ely <HI>organi&s;ed Body,</HI> with external Ob|jects. But this is a Con&s;ideration more plau&s;ible than weighty, unle&s;s it could be made to appear, that the <HI>Mind,</HI> upon Failure of that <HI>bodily Organi|zation,</HI> by Means of which it is <HI>now</HI> affected and moved, mu&s;t be, if not de&s;troyed, yet, at lea&s;t, re|duced to an <HI>inactive</HI> State; becoming incapable of receiving other Ideas, or exerci&s;ing it &s;elf in Con|templation on tho&s;e it has already received: Which perhaps can never be done. It is allowed by all Inquirers into Nature, that the <HI>pre&s;ent Method,</HI> ac|cording to which the Mind receives Ideas, is an <HI>arbitrary</HI> Con&s;titution: To be &s;ure, it is not the only po&s;&s;ible one; for if it was, then no <HI>Mind,</HI> or <HI>think|ing Being,</HI> could be impre&s;&s;ed with Ideas, but in Conformity to this Law of Nature: Which, with|out all Doubt, is contrary to the Truth of Fact. And if the Mind <HI>may</HI> receive Ideas, and exert it &s;elf in making the proper U&s;e of them, without being confined to the <HI>pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed Order of Nature,</HI> it can never be proved, that, when this cea&s;es to take place, as it will at <HI>Death,</HI> the Mind becomes <HI>&s;tupid, &s;en&s;ele&s;s</HI> and <HI>inactive.</HI> It &s;hould &s;eem far more rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Death</HI> only puts an End to that <HI>con&s;tituted Method,</HI> according to which the <HI>Mind,</HI> at pre&s;ent, receives Sen&s;ations from this material World; introducing &s;ome <HI>unknown Change</HI> as to the <HI>Manner</HI> of its Communication with <HI>that</HI> it then goes into.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="006298_0012_10288458F93BF270">
And thus the Exi&s;tence of the <HI>Soul,</HI> after <HI>Death,</HI> as a <HI>living, active, thinking</HI> Being, is a Suppo&s;ition perfectly agreeable to the Principles of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> as well as the Doctrine of <HI>Revelation.</HI></P>

<P>But the greate&s;t Trouble of good Men ari&s;es from the Burden of Sin, they at pre&s;ent groan under.

<P><HI>Their Works do follow them.</HI> i. e. The <HI>good Di&s;|po&s;itions</HI> which were confirmed and improved by the frequent Performance of them.

And good Men have accordingly improved their virtuous Habits, in a le&s;s or greater Degree, in Proportion to the Acts of Virtue, or tho&s;e good Works, they have performed, in Obedience to the Will of GOD. And the&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions, with all their Improvements, they car|ry with them into the other World: And they are another Source of the Happine&s;s they will there enjoy. At pre&s;ent, they reap no &s;uch Satisfaction as that which is the Fruit of their virtuous Di&s;po&s;iti|ons &s;utably exerci&s;ed: And the Connection be|tween
<PB N="20" REF="006298_0018_1028845B74FB56D8">
Happine&s;s and virtuous Exerci&s;es will much more take place, in the future State.

<P><HI>Their Works do follow them.</HI> i. e, in fine, the <HI>Reward</HI> of them, freely be&s;towed for the Sake of JESUS CHRIST.

<P>I &s;hall only add, as the <HI>Dead who die in the LORD</HI> are <HI>ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> in that <HI>their Works do follow them,</HI> it is obvious to remark, that their Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s will be <HI>various,</HI> in <HI>Degree,</HI> both in their <HI>&s;eparate State,</HI> and after they are received to <HI>Heaven,</HI> accord|ing to the <HI>Variety</HI> there has been in <HI>their Works.</HI> Not that there is any <HI>Merit</HI> in the <HI>Works,</HI> even of tho&s;e who are <HI>in</HI> CHRIST.

<P>She was a Per&s;on endowed with de&s;irable Quali|ties; a good Under&s;tanding, a &s;olid Judgment, and a well-turned Mind: Sober and grave, yet plea&s;ant and chearful: cautious and re&s;erved, yet, upon &s;utable Occa&s;ions, wi&s;ely free and open: meek and gentle, yet capable of Re&s;entment, when proper and nece&s;&s;ary; though not ha&s;ty to be angry, not given to Wrath, never bitter, never revengeful, never clamorous and noi&s;y: Candid, and ever in|clined to &s;peak well of others: Compa&s;&s;ionate to the poor and afflicted, and not envying them who pro&s;per in the World: Generous, yet frugal in her Expences: Humble in her Deportment, and adorn|ing her&s;elf in mode&s;t Apparel: A Keeper at home, yet a Friend to all the good Offices of Neighbour|hood and Acquaintance: Singularly <HI>prudent;</HI> not prone to be ra&s;h in Conduct, not acting without Thought, and at Random; but apt to foreca&s;t her Affairs, and guide them with Di&s;cretion.&mdash;And as &s;he was formed to behave well in the &s;everal Rela|tions of Life, few better filled them with the Duties proper to them. As a <HI>Wife,</HI> how engaging in her Carriage! how faithful! how dutiful! As a <HI>Mother,</HI> how tender and affectionate! how vigilant! 'having her Children in Subjection with all Gravity.' As <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> in the Family, how prudent in her OEco|nomy! how provident! how diligent! The <HI>Wi&s;e Man</HI>'s De&s;cription of the <HI>virtuous Woman</HI> is very much her's, 'She openeth her Mouth with Wi&s;|dom, and in her Tongue is the Law of Kindne&s;s. She looketh well to the Ways of her Hou&s;hold, and eateth not the Bread of Idlene&s;s. Her Children

ari&s;e up, and call her ble&s;&s;ed; her Hu&s;band al&s;o, and he prai&s;eth her.' <HI>Prov.</HI> xxxi. 26, 27, 28.</P>
<P>But her greate&s;t Glory was her being a <HI>Woman in</HI> CHRIST, a real good Chri&s;tian; as we cannot but charitably believe and judge. Tho&s;e acquainted with her, when young, &s;peak of her as having then a &s;erious Bent of Mind; noted for her Sobriety, Mo|de&s;ty, and decent Chri&s;tian Behaviour. And &s;he, all along in Life, di&s;covered an Abhorrence of Vice, in all its various Shapes and Kinds; and expre&s;&s;ed a becoming Regard to the Things of GOD and Religion. She was a daily diligent Reader of her Bible, and con&s;tant in her Retirements for Devoti|on: A Lover of the Hou&s;e, and public Wor&s;hip of GOD; taking Care to &s;anctify his <HI>Day,</HI> and devout|ly attend on all his In&s;titutions.&mdash;But CHRIST, above all, was the lovely Object of her De&s;ire, and Faith, and Hope. Into his Hands &s;he committed the great Affair of her Soul's Salvation: On his Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and Merits &s;he depended for Acceptance with GOD to eternal Life: His Image &s;he was adorned with: And the Graces of his <HI>Spirit</HI> &s;he liv|ed in the daily Exerci&s;e of; endeavouring in all Things to plea&s;e and &s;erve him.&mdash;</P>
<P>It was on Account of the&s;e, and &s;uch like Strokes, in her Character, that &s;he lived &s;o generally beloved, and died &s;o generally lamented; leaving behind her a 'Name better than precious Ointment.' I doubt not I have a Witne&s;s in the Hearts of many of you, to the Truth of all that I have &s;aid concern|ing her. You, the Wor&s;hippers of GOD in this Hou&s;e, ju&s;tly entertained an high Opinion of her: And I cannot but mention to your Honour, and the Imitation of the Churches, the <HI>Re&s;pect</HI> you &s;o readily &s;hewed to <HI>her,</HI> as well as <HI>Sympathy</HI> with your bereaved <HI>Pa&s;tor,</HI> in the hand&s;ome Provi&s;ion you

made, by your generous Sub&s;cription, for her decent Funeral.&mdash;But &s;he is now gone, not out of Being, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, though out of our World. In her la&s;t Sickne&s;s, &s;he was &s;ilent and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive; as, at other Times before, &s;he had &s;et a bright Example of Patience and Firmne&s;s of Mind under great Af|flictions. On her Death-bed, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her De|&s;ire to depart and be with CHRIST; and her Hope, that for her to die, would be Gain. And we doubt not, &s;he is gone to be with CHRIST, (to whom &s;he lived) in the Place GOD has appointed for the Reception of unimbodied Spirits.</P>
<P>And what a Spring of Joy is this to the &s;urviving Relatives! How thankful &s;hould they be, that they are not called to 'mourn as tho&s;e who have no Hope'? And how &s;hould they temper their Sor|row with the Thought, that their departed Friend, though 'ab&s;ent from the Body, is pre&s;ent with the LORD'!</P>
<P>We heartily wi&s;h for them all the Supports of Di|vine Grace, the Comforts of the HOLY GHOST, and tho&s;e Influences from above, under this 'Tryal of their Faith,' whereby they may be enabled to be|have &s;o as that CHRIST may be glorified, their own Holine&s;s promoted, and their future Crown of Glory made more bright and weighty.</P>
<P>We unite in our Supplications to the Throne of GOD particularly for the mourning <HI>Hu&s;band,</HI> that he may be helped to exhibit &s;uch a Temper and Conduct, upon this Occa&s;ion, as that there may be no Rea&s;on to apply to him the Words of <HI>Eliphaz</HI> to <HI>Job,</HI> 'Be|hold, thou ha&s;t in&s;tructed many, and thou ha&s;t &s;trengthened the weak Hands. Thy Words have upholden him that was falling, and thou ha&s;t &s;treng|thened the feeble Knees. But now it is come upon

thee, and thou fainte&s;t; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled': But, on the contrary, that it may be &s;aid of him, he &s;ets before his Flock a bright Pat|tern of Meekne&s;s and Humility, of Faith, Patience, Submi&s;&s;ion, and a &s;teady Tru&s;t in GOD, and firm Reliance on his Perfections and Promi&s;es. And may he be quickened to go on in his LORD's Work, with greater Zeal, Vigour, Fidelity, and active Di|ligence. And in fine, may he, from his own Expe|rience of the Divine Con&s;olations, under this trying Providence, have Rea&s;on to exult with the holy Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> and &s;ay, 'Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, even the Father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, the Father of Mercies, and the GOD of all Comfort, who com|forteth us in all our Tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any Trouble, by the Comfort wherewith we our &s;elves are comforted of GOD.'</P>
<P>We wi&s;h al&s;o, for the bereaved <HI>Children,</HI> the Grace of GOD whereby they may be di&s;po&s;ed and enabled to be Followers of their departed <HI>Mother,</HI> wherein &s;he followed CHRIST. And may you her <HI>Sons</HI> appear as 'beautiful Plants grown up in your Youth': And you her <HI>Daughters,</HI> &s;hine as 'Corner-Stones poli&s;hed after the Similitude of a Palace.'</P>
<P>Our Prayer likewi&s;e for the mourning <HI>Si&s;ters</HI> is, that the LORD JESUS CHRIST would &s;ay to them, for their Support and Comfort, as he did in the Days of his Fle&s;h to the <HI>Si&s;ters</HI> of dead <HI>Lazarus,</HI> 'I am the Re&s;urrection and the Life: He that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet &s;hall he live.'</P>
<P>And may it plea&s;e a good and gracious GOD to &s;anctify this repeated Stroke of his Hand upon <HI>this Church</HI> of JESUS CHRIST. We have Rea&s;on to la|ment, and pray, with <HI>David,</HI> 'Help LORD, for

<P>And may we all get <HI>&s;piritual Good</HI> by the Provi|dence we are now lamenting.</P>
<P>And may the <HI>Daughters in Zion,</HI> in &s;pecial, hear the Voice of GOD, &s;peaking as it were particularly to them; and be quickened therefrom to live as tho&s;e who mu&s;t &s;hortly die.

And 'your Adorning, let it be the hidden Man of the Heart; even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit: which is, in the Sight of GOD, of great Price.'</P>
