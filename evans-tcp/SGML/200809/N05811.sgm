<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOB IX. v, vi.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Which removeth the Mountains, and they know not; which overturneth the Earth in his Anger; which &s;haketh the Earth out of her Place, and the Pillars thereof tremble.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;haking of the earth, when it ari&s;es to any great degree, is one of the mo&s;t awful events in all nature. It is attended with danger, which none can either with&s;tand, avoid, or make their e&s;cape from: And the de&s;truction it threatens is &s;udden, and dreadful, and equally extends to all the various ranks, conditions, and ages of men; whether high or low, rich or poor, bond or free, old or young. It is therefore an occurrence that is &s;ingularly fitted to &s;trike the mind with &s;urprize; and whether we will or no, it alarms our fears, and awakens in us a quick and
<PB N="6" REF="007380_0004_102B8C8278712C48">
pungent &s;en&s;e of the power and greatne&s;s of God. The mo&s;t hardened &s;inners, tho&s;e who have mock't at fear, and laugh't at de&s;truction, are hereby rou&s;ed into a&s;toni&s;hment. Even the dumb creatures are affected with a kind of horror, and very &s;ignificantly expre&s;s it by their dolorous roars, tho' not modulated into articulate &s;ounds.</P>
<P>Of this we had a very lively illu&s;tration the la&s;t week, when God aro&s;e, and &s;uddenly awoke us out of our &s;leep, by terribly &s;haking the earth. We were all thrown into a &s;tate of trembling. Horror took hold of us, and we were afraid of this tremendous judgment of God; not knowing but we &s;hould &s;ink down quick into &s;ome deep cavern below, or be buried in the ruins of our own habitations. May we never forget the di&s;tre&s;s of that awful morning, and our de|liverance out of it!</P>
<P>It is with a view to a&s;&s;i&s;t both you, and my&s;elf, in making a wi&s;e and religious improvement of &s;o extraor|dinary a providence, that I have &s;elected this text to em|ploy our pre&s;ent meditations. It obviou&s;ly contains two things well worthy of our &s;pecial notice, namely,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That 'tis GOD who maketh the <HI>earth to &s;hake,</HI> and <HI>the pillars thereof to tremble.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That he <HI>ordinarily</HI> does this in <HI>te&s;timony</HI> of his <HI>righteous anger.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. 'Tis GOD who maketh the <HI>earth</HI> to <HI>&s;hake</HI> and <HI>tremble.</HI></P>
<P>And this he does, either by an <HI>immediate</HI> exertment of his almighty power, or by concurring with &s;uch <HI>&s;econd cau&s;es</HI> as are fitted, in the natural cour&s;e of their operation, to produce &s;o wonderful an effect.</P>
<P>There may have been <HI>miraculous</HI> earthquakes, earthquakes that took ri&s;e from the <HI>immediate</HI> hand of God. The earthquakes which accompanied <HI>I&s;rael'</HI>s
<PB N="7" REF="007380_0005_102B8459987E9D58">
pa&s;&s;age thro' the <HI>red &s;ea,</HI> and the river <HI>Jordan,</HI> com|memorated by the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;alm.</HI> 114, might be of this &s;ort. The earthquake, which &s;wallow'd up <HI>Co|rah</HI> and <HI>company,</HI> recorded <HI>Numb.</HI> 16. 30&mdash;33, might be another in&s;tance of the &s;ame kind. So, when the God of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> de&s;cended on <HI>Sinai,</HI> and publi&s;hed his law from thence, it might be <HI>miraculou&s;ly,</HI> that <HI>the whole mount quaked greatly, Exod.</HI> 19. 18. In allu&s;ion to this wonderful event the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> &s;ays, P&s;al. 68. 7, <HI>The earth &s;hook, the heavens al&s;o dropped at the pre&s;ence of God: even</HI> Sinai <HI>it&s;elf was moved at the pre&s;ence of God, the God of I&s;rael.</HI> And of the &s;ame kind &s;till might be the earthquake which happened at the cruci|fixion of our Lord, &s;poken of in that language, <HI>Matt.</HI> 29. 51. <HI>And behold, the vail of the temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom; and the Earth did quake, and the rocks rent:</HI> And that al&s;o which was felt at his re&s;urrection, recorded in tho&s;e words, <HI>Matt.</HI> 28. 2, <HI>And behold, there was a great earthquake!</HI> The&s;e earthquakes, 'tis ob&s;ervable, were all produced in an <HI>age of miracles,</HI> at a time when the great God, in other in&s;tances, exerted his <HI>immediate</HI> almighty power; for which rea&s;on it may probably eno' be &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>the&s;e</HI> al&s;o were effected by a <HI>&s;upernatural</HI> operation.</P>
<P>But more commonly the great God makes u&s;e of <HI>&s;econd Cau&s;es</HI> in the production of earthquakes; ex|erting his power, not <HI>immediately,</HI> but by <HI>concurring with the&s;e Cau&s;es.</HI> There are &s;tores of them, no doubt, in the bowels of the earth: But knowe&s;t thou, O man, what they are, or how they operate to the production of the&s;e amazing events? Much has been &s;aid, upon the origin of earthquakes, by men of learning; but, after all that yet has been &s;aid, and by the greate&s;t Philo&s;ophers too, perhaps, this work of God may ju&s;tly be ranked among tho&s;e marvellous ones, which cannot be comprehended; and in contemplation on which
<PB N="8" REF="007380_0006_102B8C8675AC43D0">
we may take to our&s;elves words, and &s;ay, <HI>Behold, God is great, and we know him not!</HI> The noi&s;e of his voice, in the deep caverns of the earth, who can ex|plain! That amazing power, which cau&s;es the earth, in a circle of hundreds of miles, to quiver and tremble, or undulate in waves like tho&s;e of the &s;ea, who can under&s;tand! But tho' we can't penetrate into the &s;ecret &s;prings of an exten&s;ive terrible earthquake; yet we have no rea&s;on to think, but that it takes ri&s;e from &s;uf|ficient <HI>&s;econd Cau&s;es,</HI> in common with the other phae|nomena of nature: Only the&s;e cau&s;es mu&s;t always be con&s;idered as having the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of all things for their director and Governor. The &s;haking of the earth, in every in&s;tance, is bro't to pa&s;s under the &s;uper|intending guidance, and almighty concurrence, of the &s;upreme regent of nature. <HI>Second Cau&s;es</HI> may, while working in a natural way, produce this effect; but &s;till God is more a great deal the cau&s;e of them than they. 'Twas he who at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd the laws of nature, giving to all &s;econd cau&s;es their re&s;pective powers of operation, and a&s;&s;igning to them their &s;everal &s;pheres of acting.&mdash;Tis he who upholds them all in being and operation; for by him do all things con&s;i&s;t.&mdash;Tis he who concurs with them in their influence, &s;o as that without him they could not act at all.&mdash;Tis he who directs and governs all their motions and &s;prings of action; and &s;o over-rules them, as that they &s;hall exert their force in this, or that place, to this or that degree, ju&s;t as he plea&s;es, and as may be&s;t &s;erve his de&s;igns in the kingdom of providence.</P>
<P>So that tho' earthquakes are <HI>ordinarily</HI> produced, in a natural way, by a concurrence of &s;uitable and &s;ufficient &s;econd cau&s;es; yet it is God who produces them: He is more properly their <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> than any <HI>&s;econdary</HI> one, or than all &s;econdary ones together: For they are all his; he made them; he upholds
<PB N="9" REF="007380_0007_102B8C889CAAE1E8">
them; he commands them; he controuls and over|rules them: They act by him, and for him; and can do nothing without him.</P>
<P>And tis on &s;uch accounts as the&s;e, that the &s;cripture &s;o frequently &s;peaks of Earthquakes as the <HI>work of God;</HI> repre&s;enting him as that glorious being, who <HI>&s;haketh the earth, and overturneth the mountains.</HI> That is the language, in which the pious <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> has taught us to &s;peak of an earthquake, <HI>P&s;alm.</HI> 60. 1, 2, <HI>O God, thou ha&s;t made the earth to tremble.</HI> So, when he would de&s;cribe an earthquake, tis in &s;uch words as tho&s;e, P&s;alm. 104. 32, <HI>He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the hills, and they &s;moke.</HI> In like manner, holy <HI>Job,</HI> &s;peaking in my text, of earth|quakes, carries our tho'ts beyond all <HI>&s;econd Cau&s;es</HI> to the glorious <HI>fir&s;t Cau&s;e</HI> of all things: <HI>Which removeth the mountains; which overturneth them in his anger; which &s;haketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</HI> Agreable whereto is that of the pro|phet, <HI>Amos</HI> 9. 5, <HI>And the Lord of ho&s;ts is he that toucheth the land, and it &s;hall melt; and it &s;hall ri&s;e up wholly like a flood;</HI> that is, it &s;hall appear with a motion like that of the waves in a flood.&mdash;But it would be needle&s;s to enlarge here. You are all, I believe, convinced not only of the being and perfections, but of the providential government of God; that his throne is prepared in the heavens, and that his kingdom ruleth over all, extending even to the motion of a <HI>&s;par|row,</HI> and the falling of a <HI>hair</HI> from off our heads; much more to tho&s;e violent concu&s;&s;ions in the deep caverns of the earth, which make it to tremble.</P>
<P>Only, let me, as the proper improvement of this part of my &s;ubject, put you upon attending to this truth, and exerci&s;ing an affectionate awaken'd faith in it, with re&s;pect to the great event of the other morning. Seriou&s;ly carry your tho'ts beyond all <HI>&s;econd Cau&s;es,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="007380_0008_102B8C8A99D8BAD0">
and fix your eye on <HI>God</HI> as the &s;upreme author of the dreadful earthquake that then fill'd you with di&s;tre&s;s; and encourage in your minds the mo&s;t lively appre|hen&s;ions both of his <HI>power</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> which were eminently di&s;played at that time, taking care to pay him tho&s;e <HI>religious</HI> acknowledgments that are his due.</P>
<P>There is, perhaps, no work in the kingdom of pro|vidence, that renders the great God more awfully glorious, than this of his terribly &s;haking the earth under us, and our hou&s;es over us. A mo&s;t marvellous di&s;play is hereby made of his <HI>almighty power.</HI> How weak and feeble do all creatures appear in compari&s;on with him! If he does but touch the mountains, they tremble; the hills, and they are moved at his pre|&s;ence! One of the fir&s;t tho'ts that ari&s;es in the mind, upon the &s;hock of an earthquake, is that, "the Lord is a mighty God; what God is there in the heaven, or in the earth, that can do according to his works, and according to his might"? Let us, from what we &s;aw, and felt, in the late earthquake, entertain in our hearts an awakened apprehen&s;ion of him as clothed with power; and be in a di&s;po&s;ition to fall down before him with &s;uch religious acknowledgments in our mouths as tho&s;e, "Thou art great, O Lord; there is none like thee, neither is there any God be&s;ides thee: Thou ha&s;t a mighty arm, and &s;trength is in thy right hand: Thou art the Lord God omnipotent." And let us fear to of|fend this great and holy Lord God, who&s;e is the pow|er, and the greatne&s;s, and the maje&s;ty; who can do what&s;oever he plea&s;es in heaven, and earth, and all deep places, and in a moment, at any time, de&s;troy our <HI>Souls</HI> as well as bodies, and this in <HI>hell.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>The <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> of God has likewi&s;e been wonder|fully manife&s;ted in this event of providence. To what el&s;e can it be a&s;cribed, that, when he &s;o awfully &s;hook our hou&s;es, he &s;o proportion'd the force with
<PB N="11" REF="007380_0009_102B8C8C72B8AE20">
which he did this, as that they &s;hould not be &s;hattered to pieces, and bury us in their ruins? How ea&s;y would it have been with him to have increa&s;ed the <HI>impe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> which cau&s;ed the earth to &s;hake, which if he had done but a few degrees more, the effect would inevitably have been our &s;udden and general de&s;truction? And to what can we attribute it, but to his unmerited goodne&s;s, that he thus re&s;trained his wrath, and did not &s;uffer it to involve us in common ruin? O how infinitely indebted are we to the mercy of a good God?&mdash;How &s;hould we call upon our Souls, and all that is within us to ble&s;s his holy name!&mdash;O let us never be unmindful of this marvellous mercy of God, to which alone it is owing we were not con&s;umed. How &s;hould Sinners, &s;uch in &s;pecial who are con&s;cious to them&s;elves that they are heinou&s;ly &s;o, acknowledge and adore this rich pa|tience of God towards them, which has lengthened out their lives, and their &s;pace for repentance? Had the earth, in its late agitation, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;wallowed you up in &s;ome wide cha&s;in, or put an end to your lives by the cru&s;h of your falling hou&s;es, where had you been now? Whither would your Souls have gone? O mo&s;t important enquiry!&mdash;Oh be thankful to a good God, that you are yet alive, and yet within the reach of mercy! And be in&s;tant in your care to make your peace with him, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to get into a &s;tate of &s;afety, with re&s;pect to another world; and it will now be well with you, &s;hould God ever &s;o &s;uddenly, or awfully, call you hence to be here no more.&mdash;But I mu&s;t now go on to the other ob&s;erva|tion, namely,</P>
<P>II. That when God maketh the earth to &s;hake and tremble, tis <HI>ordinarily</HI> in te&s;timony of his <HI>anger.</HI> I &s;ay <HI>ordinarily,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>anger</HI> of God has not <HI>al|ways</HI> been the <HI>more &s;pecial rea&s;on</HI> of his cau&s;ing an earthquake. He has &s;ometimes de&s;igned this to an|&s;wer
<PB N="12" REF="007380_0010_102B8C8E032AE5D8">
other ends be&s;ides te&s;tifying his di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Sometimes he may have had it in view to declare his own infinite <HI>greatne&s;s</HI> and <HI>maje&s;ty.</HI> This &s;eems to have been the <HI>more &s;pecial rea&s;on</HI> of his making the earth terribly to &s;hake, when he publi&s;h'd the law from the top of <HI>Sinai.</HI> It was not becau&s;e he was now an|gry with the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> nation; for he was <HI>&s;hewing his word unto</HI> Jacob, <HI>and his &s;tatutes and his judgments un|to</HI> I&s;rael; and dealing with them, in a way of favour, beyond what he had ever before done to any other people. But it became the divine being to appear with the en&s;igns of <HI>maje&s;ty;</HI> and it was, that he might gloriou&s;ly di&s;play his <HI>greatne&s;s</HI> and <HI>power,</HI> that he made the <HI>mount to quake &s;o terribly,</HI> when he came down upon it.</P>
<P>Sometimes his <HI>more immediate</HI> intention has been the <HI>Salvation</HI> and <HI>deliverance</HI> of his people, and to give proof of his <HI>&s;ignal pre&s;ence</HI> with them to <HI>protect, de|fend,</HI> and <HI>ble&s;s</HI> them. So, when <HI>I&s;rael</HI> went forth out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the Lord appeared marvellou&s;ly for them, and their <HI>deliverance</HI> was very much owing to the dreadful earthquake, which &s;wallow'd up <HI>Pharoah</HI> and his <HI>ho&s;t.</HI> For that their de&s;truction was bro't about by an earthquake is very plain from tho&s;e words, in <HI>Exod.</HI> 15. 12, <HI>Thou &s;tretched&s;t out thy right hand, and the earth &s;wallowed them.</HI> Tis true, there might be a double inten|tion in the production of this earthquake. If it was de&s;ign|ed as a te&s;timony of God's anger again&s;t the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and &s;ent in judgment to de&s;troy them; it was intended al&s;o, and this primarily, for the &s;alvation of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> So, when this &s;ame people had entered into <HI>Canaan,</HI> it was by earthquakes that God &s;ometimes di&s;play'd his power in favour of them, to defend and protect them. In allu&s;ion to this is that acknowledgment to the &s;upreme maje&s;ty, <HI>Judg.</HI> 5. 4. 5. <HI>Lord, when thou wente&s;t out of</HI> Seir, <HI>when thou marched&s;t out of the
<PB N="13" REF="007380_0011_102B8C8FB4C34748">
field of</HI> Edom, <HI>the earth trembled, the mount melted be|fore the Lord.</HI> It was probably by an earthquake, that God threw down the walls of <HI>Jericho,</HI> and delivered that city into the hands of the <HI>I&s;raelites;</HI> the &s;tory of which we have at large in the 6th Chapter of <HI>Jo&s;hua.</HI> And the earthquake which &s;hook open the door of the pri&s;on, were <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> were confined, was de|&s;ign'd in mercy to tho&s;e <HI>Servants of the mo&s;t high God;</HI> to vindicate their character, and make way for their re|lea&s;e, and the furtherance of the Go&s;pel thereby. In all the&s;e earthquakes, there might be an exhibition of the divine anger again&s;t the enemies of religion; but &s;till the <HI>principal</HI> intention &s;eems to have been to give proof of the pre&s;ence of God with his &s;ervants to make way for their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>In fine, &s;ometimes God has tho't fit to accompany an extraordinary <HI>out-pouring of his &s;pirit</HI> with the &s;hock of an earthquake. So, when the Apo&s;tles were united in &s;olemn prayer, there was the noi&s;e as of a <HI>mighty ru&s;hing wind,</HI> which <HI>&s;hook the place where they were a&s;&s;embled together:</HI> Upon which it follows, Acts 4. 31. <HI>they were all filled with the holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But the&s;e things notwith&s;tanding, earthquakes more commonly are &s;ent in judgment, and becau&s;e <HI>God is angry.</HI> This is very plainly intimated in my text; and there are numerous other &s;criptures which &s;peak to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. <HI>P&s;alm</HI> xvi. 7. <HI>The earth &s;hook and trembled; the foundations al&s;o of the hills moved, and were &s;haken, becau&s;e he was wroth.</HI> Ezek. xxxviii. 19, 20, compared with <HI>Nahum</HI> i. 5, 6. <HI>The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burnt at his pre&s;ence; yea, the world, and all that dwell therein. Who can &s;tand before his indignation? And who can abide in the fiercene&s;s of his wrath? His fury is poured out like fire; and the rocks are thrown down by him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="007380_0012_102B8C9257EF3668">
But had the &s;cripture been &s;ilent upon this head, we might ea&s;ily have known, that earthquakes are a token of the <HI>divine anger.</HI> They are, in their opera|tion, the mo&s;t fearful events, and carry with them the mo&s;t lively &s;ignatures of <HI>di&s;plea&s;ure.</HI> How can we do any other than conclude, that the maje&s;ty of heaven is <HI>angry,</HI> when we behold him throwing the earth into &s;uch a &s;tate, as that it &s;truggles and heaves, as though all over convul&s;ed? This indeed is the &s;entiment of all hearts, at &s;uch an awful time. Who is there that is not filled with concern, from an ap|prehen&s;ion of the great God as <HI>angry?</HI> How do our &s;ins now fly in our faces? How con&s;cious are we of guilt? How di&s;tre&s;t le&s;t God &s;hould be about to ex|ecute upon us the fiercene&s;s of his wrath? There is &s;carce a &s;inner &s;o profligate and abandoned, but fear|fulne&s;s now takes hold of him; and however thought|le&s;s he was before of God, he now reali&s;es his being and providence, has awakened in him a &s;en&s;e of his obligations to him, and cant help trembling at the thought that he is angry, and may now be about to take vengeance on him.</P>
<P>'Tis true, when the &s;haking of the earth is com|paratively light, and attended with no bad effects, men may not look upon it, at lea&s;t not con&s;ider it, as an evidence of God's di&s;plea&s;ure; but its agitati|ons are &s;ometimes &s;o violent, and the effects follow|ing thereupon &s;o di&s;mal, as to convince all, even the mo&s;t obdurate, that God is, and that he is di&s;plea&s;ed; yea, filled with indignation. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, we, in this land, have not as yet been vi&s;ited with earth|quakes that have done any more than &s;olemnly war|ned us; though they have often been &s;ent upon other places, not only to the filling men's minds with horri|ble con&s;ternation, not only to the throwing down here and there a hou&s;e, and taking away here and there a

life; but to the ingul&s;ing large cities, and numerous villages, in one common de&s;olation. The rocks have been rent, the hills moved, the mountains overturned, and the earth &s;o opened as to take down her inhabi|tants by hundreds and thou&s;ands. No le&s;s than an hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls have been de&s;troyed, in a few moments, by one dreadful earthquake. And can this be, and God at the &s;ame time not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ched with anger? Wherein could the holy righteous God more awfully make it evident, that he is di&s;plea&s;ed? War, famines, pe&s;tilences are &s;poken of in &s;cripture as the <HI>great judgments</HI> of God; but they are neither of them to be compared with <HI>earthquakes.</HI> The&s;e, of all God's judicial di&s;pen&s;ations, are the mo&s;t terrible; and the &s;ure&s;t indication of his righteous anger.</P>
<P>But you will a&s;k, it may be, what is the rea&s;on of this <HI>anger</HI> of God? From whence is it excited? Why is it &s;tirred up?</P>
<P>To this I would &s;ay, when the prophet <HI>Habakkuk</HI> &s;aw the tents of <HI>Cu&s;han in affliction,</HI> and the land of <HI>Midian</HI> in a &s;tate of <HI>trembling,</HI> he at once concluded, that God was <HI>angry;</HI> but, at the &s;ame time, was far from imagining, that it was at the inanimate <HI>earth.</HI> Says he, <HI>chapter</HI> iii. ver. 8. <HI>Was the Lord di&s;plea&s;ed again&s;t the rivers? Was thine anger again&s;t the ri|vers? Was thy wrath again&s;t the &s;ea?</HI> Far be it from the all-wi&s;e God to be angry at the <HI>rivers,</HI> or <HI>earth,</HI> or <HI>&s;ea!</HI> He is capable of anger, in the figura|tive &s;en&s;e it is applied to him, with <HI>man</HI> only on this earth, and with nothing in man but <HI>&s;in.</HI> Sin is the ground, and the only moral ground, of the anger of God, that anger of his, which cau&s;eth the earth to &s;hake and tremble. 'Tis <HI>this</HI> that tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth his law, oppo&s;es his will, affronts his &s;overeignty, re|flects contempt upon his government, and brings con|fu&s;ion into the <HI>moral</HI> world: 'Tis <HI>this</HI> therefore

that excites his di&s;plea&s;ure, and to &s;uch a degree &s;ome|times, as that he is provoked to bring on the &s;hock of an earthquake to warn, or puni&s;h, the &s;inful &s;ons of men. To this purpo&s;e are tho&s;e words of the pro|phet, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> v. 24, 25. <HI>Becau&s;e they have ca&s;t away the law of the Lord of ho&s;ts, and de&s;pi&s;ed the word of the holy one of I&s;rael,</HI> THEREFORE <HI>is the anger of the Lord kind<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> again&s;t his people, and he hath &s;tretched forth his hand again&s;t them;&mdash;and the</HI> HILLS DID TREMBLE.</P>
<P>But as the &s;cripture takes notice of <HI>&s;ome &s;ins in &s;pecial,</HI> which have excited the <HI>anger</HI> of God, and been the occa&s;ion of earthquakes, either in his <HI>threat|nings,</HI> or the <HI>execution</HI> of them; I &s;hall not think it un&s;ea&s;onable to point them out to you at this time, as particularly worthy of your mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ide|ration.</P>
<P>The &s;ins included in the term, <HI>uncleanne&s;s,</HI> have &s;o offended God, as that he has te&s;tified his <HI>anger</HI> a|gain&s;t them by an <HI>earthquake.</HI> I mention the&s;e &s;ins fir&s;t, becau&s;e they are the &s;ins in <HI>&s;pecial,</HI> which occa|&s;ioned the fir&s;t earthquake, we have an account of, in the bible; and a very tremendous one it was. You all know, what the &s;ins of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha</HI> were; and you know al&s;o, what &s;udden and terrible de&s;truc|tion was brought on them herefor.

<P>I will not pre&s;ume to determine, that it was for the &s;ins comprehended in <HI>uncleane&s;s,</HI> in di&s;tinction from others, that God was provoked the la&s;t week terribly to &s;hake the earth; but this I will venture to &s;ay, that as the&s;e &s;ins are &s;hamefully prevalent all over the land, and emphatically in this town, we might do well to e&s;teem our&s;elves warned of God again&s;t <HI>uncleanne&s;s,</HI> in all its various branches, and call'd upon to flee the&s;e filthy lu&s;ts, le&s;t, after the manner of <HI>Sodom,</HI> we al&s;o &s;hould be &s;et forth as an example, for giving our &s;elves over to fornication, and going after &s;trange fle&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Sabbath-breaking</HI> is likewi&s;e a &s;in, God has threat|ned to te&s;tify again&s;t by &s;haking the earth. The pro|phet brings in the people of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves in that language, <HI>Amos</HI> 8. 5, <HI>When will the new moon be gone, that we may &s;ell corn? and the &s;ab|bath, that we may &s;et forth wheat?</HI> And then follows an awful denunciation from God, v. 7. 8, <HI>The Lord hath &s;worn by the excellency of</HI> Jacob, <HI>Surely I will not forget any of their works: &s;hall not the land trem|ble for this?</HI></P>
<P>And tis no wonder he has been &s;o &s;evere in &s;ignifying his di&s;plea&s;ure at the violation of his <HI>Sabbath.</HI> For tis one of the laws he publi&s;h'd from <HI>Sinai,</HI> and with more awful pomp than he ever before, or &s;ince, pub|li&s;hed any of his laws. And tis a law, the due ob|&s;ervation whereof has a near connection with the reli|gious ob&s;ervation of the other divine precepts. If

men are &s;acredly careful to &s;anctify the <HI>Sabbath</HI> in their hearts, clo&s;ets, and families, as well as in the place of public wor&s;hip, it will have an happy influence on their general temper and conduct, to render them amiable and lovely: Whereas, if they have upon their minds no &s;erious &s;en&s;e of <HI>Sabbath-&s;anctification,</HI> and make little or no difference between <HI>Lord's-'Days,</HI> and other days, neglecting religion in them&s;elves and fami|lies, as well as in the &s;anctuary; or attending on &s;ab|bath-duties in a formal &s;uperficial manner, the &s;ame unhallow'd &s;pirit will be likely to run thro' their whole behaviour in the world. And it &s;eldom happens, but men are loo&s;e and prophane in other regards, if they are &s;o with re&s;pect to the <HI>Sabbath.</HI> This therefore of remembring the &s;abbath-day to keep it holy, is a duty of greater importance, than many may be ready to imagine; and the neglecting, or prophaning, the day by idlene&s;s, recreation, or unnece&s;&s;ary worldly employ|ments, is highly di&s;plea&s;ing to God: And we may the rather think &s;o, becau&s;e he has threatned this &s;in with &s;o awful a judgment.</P>
<P>And &s;uffer me to remind you here, it was on the evening of the &s;abbath, about eight and twenty years ago, that we were &s;urprized with the mo&s;t fearful earthquake that was ever before known in the coun|try; it was on a &s;abbath-day al&s;o, and while in the place of wor&s;hip, that we were again &s;urprized, about ten years &s;ince, with a like, tho' more moderate, &s;hak|ing of the earth; and the la&s;t evening, which we e|&s;teem a part of the &s;abbath, we were yet again alarmed with an agitated earth. Ought we not to take occa|&s;ion from hence to reflect upon our <HI>Sabbath-&s;ins</HI> as particularly provoking to God? May we not learn the meaning of the threatning in providence by the <HI>timeing</HI> of it? Are not our tho'ts naturally pointed to the di&s;honor we have done God, by di&s;regarding that law of his which binds us to &s;anctify the &s;abbath?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="007380_0017_102B8C9DFACEFE20">
It cannot be pretended, that the <HI>&s;abbath</HI> is ob&s;erved among us with that con&s;cience and care, which might rea&s;onably be expected, con&s;idering our high profe&s;&s;i|ons to regard it as a day to the Lord.&mdash;Are not many too ready to &s;ay with the Jews, in the text we ju&s;t now mentioned, <HI>when will the &s;abbath be gone,</HI> that we may go about our worldly bu&s;ine&s;s? Are not many as free to take their diver&s;ions on this day, as on any other? Do not many neglect the public wor&s;hip on this day, and take as little care to cultivate religion in their families, or in their own &s;ouls? We have cer|tainly rea&s;on, we e&s;pecially of this town, to call our &s;elves to account for our breaches of the holy &s;ab|bath, to con&s;ider of our pa&s;t omi&s;&s;ions of duty, and commi&s;&s;ions of &s;in, and to humble our&s;elves herefor before God: Nor would this be a mi&s;improve|ment of the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation of God.</P>
<P><HI>Pride</HI> is another &s;in God has te&s;tified his anger a|gain&s;t by earthquakes. To this purpo&s;e is that of the prophet, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> ii. 12, 17, 21. <HI>For the day of the Lord of ho&s;ts &s;hall be upon every one that is proud, and lofty; and upon every one that is lifted up: And he &s;hall be brought low. And the loftine&s;s of man &s;hall be bowed down, and the haughtine&s;s of man &s;hall be made low; and the Lord alone &s;hall be exalted in that day,</HI>&mdash;<HI>when he &s;hall ari&s;e to &s;hake terribly the earth.</HI></P>
<P>And 'tis no more than might be expected, that God &s;hould thus &s;ignify his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the &s;in of <HI>pride.</HI> For 'tis a &s;in that God has mentioned by name, and &s;poken of as an <HI>abomination</HI> to him. And 'tis the &s;ource of mo&s;t other &s;ins. 'Tis this that gives ri&s;e to that extravagance of dre&s;s, and tho&s;e trou|ble&s;ome, not to &s;ay indecent fa&s;hions, which the daugh|ters of Zion &s;o generally run into: 'Tis this that puts &s;o many upon exceeding their ability, as well as pro|per

&s;tation, in expen&s;ive living; the end whereof mu&s;t be their reduction to poverty in a little time, if they don't grow more humble: 'Tis this that leads men to think more highly of them&s;elves than they de&s;erve, and to treat their neighbours with &s;uch in&s;olence and contempt: In a word, 'tis this that di&s;|po&s;es men to imagine, that even God him&s;elf has as great a regard for them, as they have for them&s;elves, by which means they are di&s;contented and unthankful. We might properly take occa&s;ion to con&s;ider wherein, we may have been chargeable with this vice, in any of its branches, that we may humble our &s;elves there|for, repent, and no more, in this way, excite the anger of God.</P>
<P><HI>Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is another &s;in &s;till, which God has threatened with an earthquake; however it be com|mitted, whether by downright oppre&s;&s;ion and violence, or the more &s;ecret arts of fraud and knavery. The&s;e ways of di&s;hone&s;t dealing are particularly mentioned as the moral ground of God's cau&s;ing the earth to tremble, by the prophet <HI>Amos.</HI> He &s;peaks, in the third chapter of his prophe&s;y, ver. 4. 6, of tho&s;e who <HI>&s;wallowed up the needy,</HI> and <HI>bought the poor for &s;il|ver:</HI> Here is cruel extortion, downright oppre&s;&s;ion. In the 6th ver. he &s;peaks of tho&s;e who <HI>made the e|phah &s;mall, and the &s;hekel great; fal&s;ifying the bal|lance by deceit:</HI> Here is the more &s;ly and artful way of tricking and cheating in commerce. And now follows the threatning, in the 8th ver&s;e, <HI>&s;hall not the land tremble for this?</HI></P>
<P>We may po&s;&s;ibly think it a matter of no great im|portance, whether we are hone&s;t, or not. We may e&s;teem hone&s;ty nothing more than a pagan virtue. But we ought to know, that a real principle of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s is a chri&s;tian grace, and of ab&s;olute and indi&s;|pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity. Our Saviour has &s;aid, <HI>What&s;oever
<PB N="21" REF="007380_0019_102B846B681CD068">
ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye the &s;ame to them:</HI> Nor unle&s;s we are, in &s;ome good mea&s;ure, formed to &s;uch a temper as this, are we worthy the name of chri&s;tians? Righteou&s;ne&s;s, in all its branches towards our neighbour, as well as towards God, is what we mu&s;t practi&s;e; or we &s;hall certainly expo&s;e our&s;elves to that anger of heaven, which may cau&s;e the earth to tremble and &s;ink under us. This may be e&s;pecially worthy of our con&s;ideration, in &s;uch a day of awful rebuke as this is; and the rather, becau&s;e it may be feared, whether unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, open or &s;e|cret; in the ways of violence, or under the di&s;gui&s;e of art, is not emphatically the &s;in of <HI>New-England</HI> in general, and of this <HI>Town</HI> in particular. Says the prophet, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> v. 6. <HI>Wo unto them that join hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and field to field!</HI> He is &s;peaking of tho&s;e who do it by unfair means, in the methods of di&s;ho|ne&s;ty. The rea&s;on of this Woe follows in the 25th ver&s;e, <HI>The hills did tremble, and their carca&s;es were torn in the mid&s;t of the &s;treets;</HI> that is, by the falling of &s;cattered pieces of the hou&s;es upon them.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Drunkenne&s;s</HI> is another &s;in, it might be expected, God would vi&s;it with an earthquake. Reel|ing too and fro is the characteri&s;tic of one that is drunk. And 'tis ob&s;ervable, the prophet, when de|&s;cribing an earthquake, &s;peaks of it in much the &s;ame language. <HI>Jer.</HI> xxiv. 19, 20. <HI>The earth is moved ex|ceedingly, the earth &s;hall reel to and fro like a Drunk|ard, and &s;hall be removed like a cottage.</HI> But the man|ner of motion in an earthquake, the analogy between this judgment and <HI>drunkenne&s;s,</HI> is not the only rea&s;on we have to think, that <HI>this</HI> is a &s;in God would te&s;tify again&s;t. It is mentioned, by name, in &s;cripture, e&s;pe|cially when committed in company, and with noi&s;ie vain merriment, as that which will expo&s;e to the woe of an earthquake. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> v. 11, 12. <HI>Wo unto them that
<PB N="22" REF="007380_0020_102B846DD2430898">
ri&s;e up early in the morning, that they may follow &s;trong drink; that continue until night, till wine en|flame them. And the harp, and the viol; the tabret, and the pipe, and wine, are in their fea&s;ts: But they regard not the work of the Lord; neither con&s;ider the operation of his hands.</HI> The threatning follows, in the 25th ver&s;e, <HI>Therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled again&s;t his people, and the hills did tremble.</HI></P>
<P>An awakening con&s;ideration this to the people of <HI>New-England!</HI> among whom there are &s;o many, of whom it may with truth be &s;aid, that <HI>they follow &s;trong drink,</HI> and <HI>continue at it till they are enflamed by it.</HI> How general is the practice of <HI>drinking to</HI> exce&s;s? What large quantities of &s;pirituous liquors are there con&s;umed in this land, and in this town! Do not many of our people &s;pend too much of their time, and too much of their &s;ub&s;tance, in taverns! Are there none of them that walk in rioting and drunkenne&s;s, in addition to chambering and wanton|ne&s;s? Have we never &s;een drunkards reeling to and fro in the &s;treets, as we have pa&s;&s;ed along? And can it be thought &s;trange, if God, in te&s;timony again&s;t this enormous vice, &s;hould cau&s;e the earth to reel al&s;o? And it were well for &s;inners, in this kind, if this was all they might expect from a provoked God. But 'tis far from being &s;o. They are particularly marked, in the revelations of &s;cripture, as per&s;ons that &s;hall be excluded heaven; as we read, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 9. <HI>Drunk|ards &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God:</HI> Nor is this the wor&s;t of their ca&s;e; for unle&s;s they repent in time, they &s;hall <HI>have their part,</HI> as it is declared, <HI>Rev.</HI> xxi. 8, <HI>in the lake that burneth with fire and brim&s;tone.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, Enmity to Chri&s;t, and ill treatment of him, has been te&s;tified again&s;t by an earthquake. The next thing recorded after the death of our Saviour, which
<PB N="23" REF="007380_0021_102B846F684ABE38">
was bro't about by the hatred and malice of the Jews again&s;t his per&s;on, and religion, is that, <HI>Matt.</HI> 27. 51, <HI>The earth did quake, and the rocks rent.</HI> It might be to do honour to Chri&s;t, as the Son of God and Saviour of men, that the earth groaned, and trembled, when he gave up the gho&s;t; but his de&s;ign al&s;o, in this event, at this particular time, no doubt, was, to &s;ignify his high di&s;plea&s;ure at the Jews, who, by wicked hands, had crucified and &s;lew the Lord of glory. And if we ju&s;tify their conduct by our hatred of him; if we neg|lect his great &s;alvation; if we refu&s;e him who has &s;poken to us from heaven; if we reject his per&s;on and coun&s;el; and if, by ob&s;tinately continuing in tho&s;e &s;ins for the expiation of which he died, we virtually crucify him afre&s;h, and put him to open &s;hame:&mdash;&s;hall not we al&s;o be ju&s;tly liable to the re&s;entments of God? and would it be any wonder, if he &s;hould te&s;ti|fy his anger, by vi&s;iting us with the &s;hocks of an earth|quake? While we refu&s;e to have this man to reign over us, and expre&s;s our di&s;regard to him by our un|belief and di&s;obedience, we are in danger not only of judgments in this world, but of the dam|nation of hell. O that we had upon our minds a due &s;en&s;e of this! And that we might herefrom be awakened to a &s;peedy flight to Chri&s;t, in the Go&s;pel way! We &s;hall then be &s;afe from evil here, and &s;ecure from the divine wrath hereafter.</P>
<P>Enough, I believe, has now been &s;aid to &s;atisfy us, that the <HI>anger</HI> of God is <HI>that</HI> which excites him to &s;end <HI>earthquakes;</HI> as al&s;o to point out tho&s;e <HI>&s;ins</HI> which may <HI>eminently</HI> be the ground of his di&s;plea&s;ure, te&s;ti|fied by the&s;e judicial di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P>And now, from what has been di&s;cour&s;ed, may we not ju&s;tly fear, that God is <HI>angry</HI> with his people in this <HI>town</HI> and <HI>land?</HI> When he &s;haketh the earth, tis becau&s;e he is <HI>angry:</HI> And why is he angry? Surely, not at the
<PB N="24" REF="007380_0022_102B84722EF69D10">
earth which trembles: no; but at the <HI>&s;ins</HI> of the people who dwell on it. And as we are a &s;inful and degenerate people, we have all the rea&s;on in the world to con|clude, tis becau&s;e God is <HI>angry</HI> with us for our <HI>&s;ins,</HI> that he has thus aro&s;e to &s;hake terribly the earth under us, and our hou&s;es over us: Nor need we be at any lo&s;s to know what the &s;ins are, that have excited his di&s;plea&s;ure, and the manife&s;tations of it, in this way, again&s;t us. The &s;ins of <HI>Sodom</HI> are to be found, even in this land of Go&s;pel-light and advantages.&mdash;We are as weary of the Lord's <HI>&s;abbaths,</HI> and as remi&s;s and neg|ligent in our attendance on the duties proper to them, as were the Jews of old.&mdash;We are become &s;hamefully defective in the government, in&s;truction and religion of our hou&s;holds. Our children and &s;ervants are many of them vile, and we re&s;train them not. God, the founder of our families, is not &s;o generally ac|knowledged in them, as might rea&s;onably be expected, con&s;idering the example of our fathers. There are many hou&s;es, it may be feared, e&s;pecially in this town, in which the wor&s;hip of God is not upheld; in which, perhaps, &s;carce ever a prayer was put up to almighty God.&mdash;And what &s;ins are there that are not committed in the land? We have ri&s;en up, in our fa|ther's &s;tead, a generation that know not the Lord, that have done evil exceedingly in his &s;ight. We are in|deed, to an high degree of guilt, addicted to profane|ne&s;s, worldline&s;s, di&s;hone&s;ty, pride, extravagance, luxu|ry, intemperance, and all other immoralities, which ought not to be &s;o much as named among chri&s;tians.&mdash;And &s;hall not God vi&s;it us for the&s;e iniquities? It can't be, but he &s;hould be angry with us. We may depend, our earth was terribly &s;hook, becau&s;e he was wroth. We were, in the moral &s;en&s;e, ripe for this awful judg|ment: And tis a wonder of mercy, the force which cau&s;ed the late trembling of our hou&s;es, was not heigh|ten'd
<PB N="25" REF="007380_0023_102B848005B3F218">
in its degree, &s;o as to bury us in their ruins. This had certainly been the ca&s;e, had God dealt with us ac|cording to our de&s;erts. Ble&s;&s;ed, forever ble&s;&s;ed, be his name, that in wrath he remembred mercy. It was owing to this, and to this only, that we were not involved, as other places have often been, in &s;udden and gene|ral de&s;truction.</P>
<P>What therefore remains, but that we immediately endeavour, by <HI>repentance,</HI> to remove away the ground of God's di&s;plea&s;ure. That is the voice of the <HI>&s;haking</HI> we have heard and felt, <HI>Repent, and turn from your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, that &s;o iniquity may not be your ruin.</HI> And this is the voice al&s;o of the other threatning a&s;pects of divine providence at this day. To day therefore, while it is called to day, let us hear God's voice, and not hearden our hearts, nor &s;uffer them to be hardened thro' the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in.

And wherein we may, upon &s;erious enquiry, be con&s;cious of having tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the Lord, we &s;hould immediately re|pent, and amend our doings which have not been right, and make it our care, for the time to come, to obey all God's precepts, whether they relate to our duty, to our Maker, our &s;elves, or one another. Nothing &s;hort of a <HI>general</HI> thorough change of our manners &s;hould &s;atisfy us; for nothing &s;hort of this will af|ford us ju&s;t ground of hope for a change in the di&s;|pen&s;ations of God.</P>

Were none of you, the other morning, in anxiety and concern of mind, from an apprehen&s;ion of God as angry with you? When you felt the earth &s;o awfully &s;haking under you, and your hou&s;es over you, threat|ning you with immediate de&s;truction, did you not perceive al&s;o the agitations of an accu&s;ing con&s;cience? Were none of your &s;ins then brought to your remem|brance? Did none of them fly in your faces? Had you in your hearts no fear of the Almighty? I can|not &s;uppo&s;e, but you were mo&s;t of you &s;truck with an awful dread of the power and maje&s;ty of God; and I can't but hope, that &s;ome of you tho't within your &s;elves, that, if God &s;hould &s;pare you, and give you opportunity therefor, you would, without delay, &s;et about the nece&s;&s;ary work of repentance, and &s;erving him. I cannot but hope, that one and another of you came into &s;ome &s;uch pious re&s;olution as that, <HI>wherein I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</HI> If I now &s;peak the inward &s;en&s;e and feeling of any of your minds, in that awful hour, as I tru&s;t I do; think it not un&s;ea&s;onable, if I urge upon you a care to che|ri&s;h &s;uch good impre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, and to guard again&s;t every thing that may have a tendency to era&s;e them out of your minds: Otherwi&s;e your goodne&s;s will be as <HI>the morning cloud, and the early dew, which &s;oon pa&s;s away.</HI> This was too much the ca&s;e about eight and twenty years ago, when God aro&s;e, and &s;hook the earth more terribly than had been known in the land before. The fears of multitudes were then a|larmed; they called on God; made fair promi&s;es of a reformation; and, for a while, were externally very &s;erious and devout: But they &s;oon lo&s;t the impre&s;&s;i|ons of piety, forgot their good re&s;olutions, and retur|ned to their former folly. Some, I would hope, were thoroughly humbled, and turned from their &s;ins to God: But, for the generality, their goodne&s;s was no|thing
<PB N="28" REF="007380_0026_102B8CA053CBD730">
more than a tran&s;ient bu&s;ine&s;s. As the earth grew quiet, their fears went off, and, together with them, all their concern about the one thing needful. And mu&s;t it not be &s;aid of &s;ome, notwith&s;tanding the horrible angui&s;h they were then in, that they after|wards turned out <HI>abandoned &s;inners!</HI> The latter end was much wor&s;e with them than the beginning. Let me therefore be&s;eech you in the bowels of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and in his name, to make a wi&s;e and good im|provement of the <HI>warning</HI> God is now giving you, and the <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>concern</HI> you may herefrom have ex|cited in you. Cultivate the &s;erious &s;en&s;e you have of God and religion on your minds.&mdash;Be earne&s;t in your prayers to the throne of grace, for tho&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances you will need.&mdash;Take care you don't grieve the good &s;pirit of God.&mdash;With the <HI>Jailor,</HI> who was made to tremble by the earthquake, which &s;hook the pri&s;on he had the charge of, enquire with a becoming &s;ollicitude of &s;oul, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI> And do not re&s;t &s;atisfied, until you have been enabled, under the influence of the divine &s;pirit, to <HI>believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> And, to your faith, add all other chri|&s;tian graces, and live in the daily exerci&s;e of them; and you need not then be afraid, let what will come: For you are prepared for all events, whether of time, or eternity.</P>
<P>Though I &s;hould be thought tedious, I &s;hall, upon this occa&s;ion, addre&s;s a few words to tho&s;e, who have made God their fear, and are walking in the way of his commandments. Some &s;uch, we would hope, there are among us. The good Lord increa&s;e their Number! To you I would &s;ay&punc; your &s;tate is happy: The &s;upreme regent of nature, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is your friend. His perfections are all engaged on your behalf.

di&s;mayed. <HI>Let not your hearts be troubled;</HI> you <HI>be|lieve in God,</HI> you <HI>believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> You ought indeed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an holy awe and reverence of the power and maje&s;ty of God: But you ought not to have upon your minds a &s;lavi&s;h fear and dread. It is below your character, and hope; and will argue a low degree of faith; at lea&s;t, that you have not faith in exerci&s;e.

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX; Giving a &s;ummary Account of the late EARTHQUAKE.</HEAD>
<P>ON the morning, <HI>November</HI> 18th, about 15 minutes after 4, the air calm and the heavens bright, came on the mo&s;t &s;urprizing &s;hock of an earthquake that was ever felt, &s;o far as we know, in this part of the world. I did not my &s;elf perceive any noi&s;e di&s;tinct from that which was occa&s;ion'd by the crackling of the hou&s;e where I was, and the di&s;turbance of the moveables in it; but many others, and, among the&s;e, &s;uch as were awake, and had ri&s;en from their beds to pro&s;ecute their bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ay, that it was both preceded, and accompanied, with a con&s;iderable noi&s;e, like that of di&s;tant thunder, or a &s;udden hard gu&s;t of ru&s;hing wind. The &s;hock was gradual, increa&s;ing in its &s;trength for about a minute. It then very &s;en&s;ibly abated, giving us room to hope it was going off; when, on a &s;udden, it returned with greater violence than before, &s;o as that our hou&s;es heaved, and rocked, as if they would have fallen to pieces. It continued at this height not above half a minute, gradually decrea&s;ing till we had no more any perception of it.</P>
<P>There are various opinions concerning the preci&s;e <HI>time</HI> of its continuance. Some &s;ay, it la&s;ted 4, or 5, or 6 minutes. Others think it was over in one. Tho&s;e, as I imagine, come neare&s;t to the truth, who fix it at about 3 minutes.</P>
<P>The <HI>effects</HI> were very con&s;iderable. Not to mention the fear|ful clattering that was made by our doors, windows, and walls; nor the damage we received by the breaking of our brittle ware, and the brui&s;ing of our pewter, which was thrown from the &s;helves: I &s;ay, pa&s;&s;ing over the&s;e &s;maller articles, many chimnies, it is tho't &s;everal &s;cores, were broken off near the top of our hou&s;es, and thrown down. A le&s;s number, it may be 20, were cracked thro', all round, a few feet from the top; and &s;ome of them &s;trangely di&s;locat|ed, and turned from their former po&s;ition. Perhaps, a 1000 or 1500
<PB N="31" REF="007380_0029_102B8CA66DE1D598">
chimnies have been more lightly damaged in various degrees. The roofs of &s;ome hou&s;es, and the gable ends of a few others as far as the caves, were broken in, either by the violence with which they were &s;hook, or by the falling of the chimnies on them. It is &s;aid, that many clocks and watches were &s;top'd, by the &s;udden and great agitation that was given them; tho' this was not the ca&s;e with mine. And &s;ome wells have not &s;ince yielded any water, the &s;prings that fed them having been, in one way or another, &s;topped. One more effect worthy of notice, a gentleman has thus publi&s;hed from his per&s;onal view of it. "A di&s;tiller's ci&s;tern, made of plank, almo&s;t new, and very &s;trongly put together, was bur&s;t to pieces by the agitation of the liquor in it; which was thrown out with &s;uch force as to break down one whole &s;ide of the &s;hed that defended the ci&s;tern from the water, as al&s;o to &s;tave off a board or two from a fence, at the di&s;tance of 8 or 10 feet from it."</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal effects of this great Earthquake in this town. We now know, that it was of very large extent; reach|ing from <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay</HI> northea&s;tward to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> &s;outhwe&s;tward, a line, on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, of more than 500 miles: And it was felt al&s;o <HI>within land</HI> a great way. We have not had accounts as yet from the mo&s;t di&s;tant <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettlements; but doubtle&s;s they had all a very &s;trong perception of it. It does not appear to have been equally violent in all places throughout this extent; tho' it was more &s;o than was ever known before. From <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay,</HI> on the northea&s;t, it is &s;aid, "the &s;hock was much as we had it in this town." From <HI>Philadelphia</HI> on the &s;outhwe&s;t, they write, "On Tue&s;day morning, <HI>Nov.</HI> 18th, we had a &s;mart &s;hock of an earth|quake, which la&s;ted about two minutes." And in all the interme|diate places it aro&s;e to a &s;urprizing height.</P>
<P>The effects, in many of our towns, were as con&s;iderable as in this, if not more &s;o. In <HI>Pembroke,</HI> be&s;ides the breaking down of a number of chimnies, there were 4 or 5 cha&s;ms, or openings, made in the earth, from whence both water and &s;and were thrown out. In <HI>Scituate,</HI> near the large dwelling-hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Bailey,</HI> there was 7 openings of the ground, which &s;till remain percepti|ble; one of them within 20 yards of the hou&s;e, and the whole 7 within a few rods of it. From the&s;e have i&s;&s;ued large quantities of water, and (at the lowe&s;t computation) 10 cart loads of a &s;trange &s;ort of earth, as fine as flower, and of a whitei&s;h com|plection. The hou&s;e it&s;elf was mo&s;t awfully &s;hook; the chimney levelled with the roof; mo&s;t of the ceiling fractured into &s;mall parts, and in many places &s;eparated from the &s;ides of the rooms; a new ca&s;e of drawers thr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">own, and tho't to be irreparably
<PB N="32" REF="007380_0030_102B8CA7FAC55D48">
&s;hatter'd: Be&s;ides which, 70 &s;quare feet of a firm cellar wall was bur&s;t from its former po&s;ition, and another con&s;iderable part of it thrown to the ground. At <HI>Newington,</HI> in <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> there was an eruption, near the hou&s;e for publick wor&s;hip, 60 rods long, and 2 feet wide; the mo&s;t hideous cha&s;m we have yet heard of. In one place and another, the old &s;prings were &s;hut up, and new ones opened; and in all places the &s;tone fences were, more or le&s;s, &s;haken down. The damage, in this article only, is &s;et, moderately computing, at about fifty thou&s;and pounds, in the com|mon way we reckon money.</P>
<P>The agitation occa&s;ioned by this earthquake was not confin'd to the dry-land. The ve&s;&s;els in the harbour of this town, and I &s;up|po&s;e in other harbours al&s;o, were made fearfully to quiver and &s;hake; and it &s;eemed to tho&s;e, who were in them, as tho' they were a-ground, and beating upon &s;mall balla&s;t. Some that were in the bay, coming in from &s;ea, tho't they had unhappily &s;truck upon the rocks or &s;ands. A gentleman, who came pa&s;&s;enger in a ve&s;&s;el from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> &s;ays, that, 70 leagues to the ea&s;t of <HI>Cape-Ann,</HI> they were &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed, about the time the earthquake came on here, &s;uppo&s;ing they had run foul of a wreck, or got upon a bar, till, on throwing over the lead, they found they had more than 50 fathom water. As the morning light came on, they &s;aw 3 large whales on the top of the water, and by their continuing perfectly &s;till, they was ready to think, they were dead; tho' they could not reduce this to a certainty, having no bullets to fire at them. They &s;aw al&s;o great numbers of other fi&s;hes, both great and &s;mall; frightened, as it was tho't, from the bottom.</P>
<P>In about an hour and 20 minutes after this great &s;hock, we had another; which, tho' comparatively &s;mall, was yet felt by mo&s;t that were up. And on the 22^d of this &s;ame month, at 40 minutes after 8, in the evening, we were alarmed with another &s;till; which, tho' not to be compared with the fir&s;t, was very affecting to mo&s;t people. The&s;e are all the &s;hocks we have had in this town; tho' el&s;ewhere they have been more numerous. In &s;ome places they have felt 5 or 6; in others 10 or 11; &amp; in others &s;till, at lea&s;t 20.</P>
<P>May we all &s;ing aright both of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>judgment!</HI> And while we <HI>fear</HI> before that God, who maketh the earth to &s;hake and tremble, let us <HI>love</HI> him al&s;o for his goodne&s;s: And may the <HI>riches</HI> of it, as they have been di&s;played towards us in our late deliverance from &s;udden and general de&s;truction, lead us to repentance.</P>
