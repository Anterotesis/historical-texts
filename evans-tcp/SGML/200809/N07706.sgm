<HEAD>A LETTER, FROM Bati&s;ta Angeloni to Manzoni.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTHING has le&s;s truth in it than what Voltaire and abb&eacute; le Bland have &s;aid relating to the Quakers in this kingdom: it is plain from what the fir&s;t has writ|ten, that he either was never in their company, or did not attend to their cu&s;toms. He de&s;cribes one of the&s;e gentry, with whom he dined, as taking off his hat, and a&s;king a benediction on his repa&s;t; in which he mu&s;t be ab&s;olutely mi&s;taken: it being the e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim of this &s;ect, never to perform that ceremony. A Quaker a&s;ks no ble&s;&s;ing from heaven before he eats, and has not gratitude enough to re|turn thanks after he is fill'd. To &s;ay the truth, tho&s;e of the church of England do both in a becoming manner.</P>
<P>If it was the &s;pirit of religious enthu&s;ia&s;m that actuated the fir&s;t Quakers; it is a &s;pirit of another kind, which reigns amongst them at pre&s;ent. If &s;implicity of dre&s;s, and &s;im|plicity of &s;peech, aro&s;e from the humble con&s;ideration of hu|man nature, in the beginning; it is love of &s;ingularity, pride, and per&s;onal advantage, which has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their hearts, and which continues their dre&s;s and man|ners in this age.</P>
<P>No creature on this globe has half the arrogance of a Quaker; he acco&s;ts the king with Friend George, the mi|ni&s;ter with Neighbour William, and this without the lea&s;t reluctance, di&s;tru&s;t of him&s;elf, or mark of confu&s;ion. What can argue greater in&s;olence than this of meeting tho&s;e per|&s;ons, upon equal terms, and treating them with the utmo&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="009839_0003_0F7A503470E165B0">
familiarity, who&s;e characters all the world agree to revere? the &s;on of a Quaker has more confident a&s;&s;urance at ten years old, than the wilde&s;t officer of the king's guards at twenty-five.</P>
<P>They call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, but I know not what title they have to that appellation; there is no &s;acrament in u&s;e in their religion: in fact, they &s;eem to be a &s;et of fatali&s;ts, who agree to call that cau&s;e which moves them to action, a &s;omething proceeding from the &s;pirit. I have heard it affirmed in their company, that the re&s;urrection of the body is not an article of their faith, if they have any at all.</P>
<P>As their number is but &s;mall, they draw advantage from that circum&s;tance, being all united in the general intere&s;t of the &s;ect. They are almo&s;t all in trade, and therefore once in the year they meet in &s;everal towns in England, to know the &s;tate of tho&s;e parts of the country: to tho&s;e places of rendezvous one or more of the Quakers of the towns within two hundred miles always come. At this time their real de&s;ign of meeting is concealed, by praying and preaching; it is a religious act to the eye, but a political one at the heart; every Quaker who a&s;&s;embles brings the &s;tate of the Trade of that town from whence he comes along with him; the parti|cular bu&s;ine&s;s of every grocer, mercer, and other trade&s;man; his indu&s;try, manner of living, and expences: by this means the whole&s;ale dealers of London, Bri&s;tol, and other great towns, are acquainted with the characters and commerce of all the trade&s;men in the kingdom: they know whether their bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;uch as that they may be &s;afely tru&s;ted with goods, if indu&s;try, and all other requi&s;ites for thriving in trade, are ob&s;erved in their affairs.</P>
<P>Thus the Quakers in the le&s;&s;er towns and cities of En|gland are &s;pies on the actions of the inhabitants, and pre|&s;erve their &s;ect from lo&s;&s;es in trade. And for this rea&s;on they endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h one of that per&s;ua&s;ion in every town, if there are none already, who may bring annual intelligence.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="009839_0004_0F7A5035B61FAEB0">Singularity to mo&s;t people's apprehen&s;ion &s;tands in the place of merit; a gimcrack in &s;hell-philo&s;ophy will lay out twenty guineas for a &s;hell that is &s;ingular, and without a fellow, though ugly and ill &s;hapen; at the &s;ame time he will not give a farthing for that which has the mo&s;t elegant &s;hape and greate&s;t diver&s;ity of colours, if the &s;pecies is nu|merous. Thus it is not beauty, but &s;ingularity which makes it e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame thing amongst men; a Quaker with his &s;ingularity of dre&s;s, &s;elf-&s;ufficient behaviour, laconic &s;tyle, and air of riches, the la&s;t of which he never fails to in&s;inu|ate to all his cu&s;tomers, catches the eyes of trade&s;men in the country; the apparent probity and power of &s;elling cheap becau&s;e wealthy, create him bu&s;ine&s;s; men in the country are de&s;irous of talking with &s;uch a man, and thus deal with him from that &s;ingularity in him, and that whim&s;ical di&s;|po&s;ition in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Quakers are extremely punctual and hone&s;t in trifles, con&s;cious that men wear out their characters before they make their fortune, who proceed otherwi&s;e in trades where riches are gotten by degrees.</P>
<P>But, in matters of con&s;equence, the right of the thing is not the que&s;tion; the power of obtaining it by artifice is the only object to be con&s;idered; and, if a fortune can be made at once, there is little he&s;itation about the manner how.</P>
<P>Is it not a little &s;urpri&s;ing, that a &s;et of men of &s;uch prin|ciples as the Quakers profe&s;s, could be &s;uffered to take root in any nation? notwith&s;tanding they have covered all the political maxims which they adopt, by the veil of religion. In the la&s;t rebellion which happened in England, they openly avowed that their principles would not allow them to oppo&s;e it. This was nothing to be remarked in a Quaker, and drew no &s;arca&s;m on the &s;ect: yet a man of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church would have been &s;tigmatized for a Jacobite, that had declared any thing like this.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="009839_0005_0F7A50363A0D4C30">Their religion, it &s;eems, will not &s;uffer them to bear arms, What can be more ridiculous than this principle, to a man who knows human nature, except the people who indulge them in this humour?</P>
<P>What right have any &s;et of men to the protection of a government in times of peace, who will not a&s;&s;i&s;t with every power they po&s;&s;e&s;s to defend their country in times of war? their taxes are not greater than other peoples.</P>
<P>Are the catholics more ridiculous in indulging monks amongst them without contributing to &s;ave their country by arms, than the Britons in permitting a &s;ect amongst them|&s;elves, who openly avow that their religion will not &s;uffer them to defend their country?</P>
<P>Another indulgence their ob&s;tinacy has procured them is this; they are &s;uffered to affirm before a magi&s;trate that which all other &s;ubjects of this crown are obliged to depo&s;e upon oath on the Evangeli&s;ts. In order to ob&s;erve the effect of this &s;ufferance, I have frequently attended trials where the&s;e people have been witne&s;&s;es, and thro' the whole cour&s;e of my ob&s;ervation I have never found them give an explicit an&s;wer when it could make again&s;t their friends; nay, the chicanery and &s;earch of the council could not draw an an|&s;wer which was not filled with ambiguities.</P>
<P>Their cau&s;e of demanding this privilege is the mo&s;t con|vincing rea&s;on for its not being allowed them; it is evident they imagine that there is &s;omething more obligatory, &s;a|cred and binding in an oath, than in an affirmation: there|fore &s;ince all the individuals of a nation ought to be under the &s;ame influence and apprehen&s;ion in the admini&s;tration of an oath, it was extremely ill under&s;tood to grant this liberty of affirmation to any &s;et of men whatever. It is a road that leads to inju&s;tice; it is inju&s;tice it&s;elf, that one man &s;hould be &s;ubjected to the terrors of eternal puni&s;hment, for the breach of that which another only conceives as &s;ome|thing of a common nature.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="009839_0006_0F7A5036ACB25E18">That the legi&s;lature and the Quakers them&s;elves conceive an affirmation to be of an inferior obligation on the per&s;on who takes it, to that of an oath, is certain: no man what|ever crime he is guilty of, can be executed on the affirma|tion of a Quaker; and no Quaker has refu&s;ed taking his oath to the execution of one that has rou&s;ed his righteous &s;pi|rit, by robbing him. Thus the legi&s;lature thinks it an indul|gence, and not equally obligatory, by making this difference in ca&s;es of life and death.</P>
<P>The Quaker who takes the common oaths of the country, in ca&s;es of being robbed, cannot at other times plead con|&s;cience again&s;t it with ju&s;tice; becau&s;e either his con&s;cience admits of doing what it knows to be wrong on the&s;e occa&s;i|ons, or he &s;creens him&s;elf from what he thinks to be right in others, and has no real exception again&s;t.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons if he is &s;uffered to take his affirmation in ca&s;es of property, he &s;hould not be indulged to take his oath in tho&s;e of life and death. He ought to adhere to his con&s;cience throughout, and not change the nature of the ob|ligation as his intere&s;t and inclination permit him. In truth, it is a weakne&s;s to excu&s;e a &s;et of men from oaths in tho&s;e in&s;tances, where all others of the kingdom are oblig|ed to take them.</P>
<P>Such are the Quakers: I leave you to decide if they are that &s;imple primitive people which Voltaire and abb&eacute; le Bland have told you; have they not found means to obtain advantages which &s;avour of refined cunning, and &s;ecure them&s;elves in &s;afety behind the ma&s;k of religion whil&s;t the nation is fighting their battles?</P>
<P>The celebrated &s;y&s;tem of P***, which has been &s;o much prai&s;ed and for &s;o little rea&s;on, is ab&s;olutely impracticable amongst men: indeed it is ea&s;y to pre&s;erve peace with the Indians, who are purcha&s;ed by &s;mall pre&s;ents to continue it; but can they buy off the French, who are preparing to in|crea&s;e their dominions in America? will the &s;pirit of meek|ne&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="009839_0007_0F7A50397AEC9840">
&s;erve them in that ca&s;e? and what has been &s;aid with re&s;pect to their indulging all religions amongst them, is not true, the catholics are excepted: the ill effects of a general naturalization is &s;en&s;ibly felt amongst them, the Germans being at pre&s;ent &s;o numerous that they pre&s;erve their lan|guage, laws, education, and intere&s;t &s;eperate, which is no &s;mall inconveniency to the country; and would as probably live under a French, as an Engli&s;h government.</P>
