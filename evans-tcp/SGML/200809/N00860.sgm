<P>And <HI>Enoch</HI> walked with God.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS <HI>Chapter</HI> contains the <HI>Chronology</HI> of the Lives of the <HI>Antidiluvian Patriarchs,</HI> from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Noah</HI>: of whom little el&s;e is mentioned, but their names, &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, long lives and death: only concerning <HI>Enoch,</HI> we have his &s;hort life, eminent piety, and wonderful Tran&s;lation here recorded, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 21, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And yet it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e, being Chri&s;ts Predece&s;&s;ors, through whom his Humanity was derived, and tho&s;e heads of Families by whom the true Religion was pre&s;erved in the world, were all of them ho|ly men. There mu&s;t therefore be &s;omething &s;ingular in <HI>Enoch,</HI> on account whereof God gave him this record, by which he te&s;tified how well be was plea&s;ed with him, as we are informed, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.5. <HI>Before his tran&s;lati|on he had this te&s;timony, that he plea&s;ed God</HI>;

which mu&s;t needs refer to the words of our <HI>Text.</HI> That which is now to be in&s;i&s;ted on, is <HI>the eminency of his piety,</HI> to which a witne&s;s is here born, to his perpetual honour; and doubtle&s;s, <HI>what&s;oever is written in the Word of God is for our admonition.</HI> Scripture Exam+ple are our Monitors, either to warn us a+gain&s;t &s;in, or to animate us unto Holine&s;s. The thing that is here a&s;&s;erted concerning <HI>Enoch</HI>; is, <HI>that he walked with God</HI>: in which few words we have a mo&s;t excellent cha|racter given of him; and they contain in them a large Hi&s;tory of his Life, by which we are given to under&s;tand, not only that he was a Godly man, and &s;eparated from the corruptions of the times; but he was &s;in|gular, and had out &s;tript other holy ones that had gone before him, or that were con|temporary with him It is ob&s;ervable, that his Walk with God is twice a&s;&s;erted in the <HI>Context</HI>; and the Spirit of God doth not u&s;e vain repetitions: it is therefore to &s;tir up our attention to it, as to a thing of &s;pecial re|mark In he former it is mentioned to &s;et forth his con&s;tancy in it, that he held on this cour&s;e per&s;everingly for <HI>three hundred years</HI>: and in what capacity, <HI>viz</HI> in an <HI>Oeco|nomical,</HI> or in a Family relation, and did not turn <HI>Anchorite</HI> for it: in the latter it is re|peated to introduce the great recompence

that God gave him, by a glorious. Tran&s;lati|on. The purport of the expre&s;&s;ion here u|&s;ed, will be enquired after in the &s;equel: The words them&s;elves will offer us this,</P>
<P><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> Walking with God is the Chri&s;tians both Duty and Glory in this Life, and the way to Eternal Felicity.</P>
<P>This Doctrine takes it for granted, that there is &s;uch a <HI>Walk</HI> to be enjoyed here, as well as <HI>Sitting down with him in his Kingdom</HI> hereafter; and is exemplified in many o|thers be&s;ides <HI>Enoch.</HI> That it is every Chri|&s;tians <HI>Duty</HI> to imitate him in this is evident, becau&s;e this is recorded of him for our en|couragement to do likewi&s;e; and that it is our <HI>Glory</HI> here, appears in that this was it which procured for him his renown above others, becau&s;e he excelled in this; and the &s;ingular Providence of God in <HI>tran&s;lating</HI> him to Heaven, <HI>not to &s;ee death,</HI> &s;hews how &s;erviceable it is to our <HI>Eternal well Being.</HI> Nor doth his &s;hort abode here any whit contra|dict the truth of this, ina&s;much as life is but a Journey to Eternity &amp; when the work of our Generation is done, it is our happine&s;s to go home. That to which I &s;hall confine the fol|lowing
<PB N="6" REF="001036_0005_0FAEE9CF905CFAE8">
di&s;cour&s;e &s;hall be an enquiry into, and re&s;olution of this great <HI>Ca&s;e, viz.</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>How may a Child of God &s;o order his life, as to maintain a continued Walk with God to the end of it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w</HI> This <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> being of greate&s;t import|ance, and for the regulation of our daily practice, it will require the more di&s;tinct con&s;ideration: but that it may be the more portable, I &s;hall endeavour to contract it &s;o far as the nature of the &s;ubject will permit. And here, to prepare the way for the <HI>Rules</HI> of direction about it, it is requi&s;ite that we make &s;ome brief enquiry into the nature of the Duty, or <HI>What it is to Walk with God</HI>? And we may ob&s;erve that there are three ex|pre&s;&s;ions made u&s;e of in the Scriptures on this account, <HI>viz. to walk with God, to walk before him, and to walk after him.</HI> Which Commentators do &s;uppo&s;e to aim at one and the &s;ame thing: and doubtle&s;s each of them doth comprehend the other two under it, though there may be &s;omething &s;pecially pointed to in each of them. <HI>Walking after God</HI> may intend a following of his Com|mand, which is the <HI>Rule of Life: Walking before him</HI> may intimate a &s;etting our &s;elves as in his pre&s;ence always, to awe our hearts into a careful endeavour to obey him: and,
<PB N="7" REF="001036_0006_0FAEE9D0662F7F58">
<HI>Walking with him</HI> may &s;ignifie our maintain|ing Communion with him in our whole Life; and hence it includes in it, a living in the practice of all tho&s;e things by which that Communion may be upheld, and avoiding of what&s;oever may interrupt it. The word is <HI>Metaphorical,</HI> and &s;erves to give light to the thing aimed at <HI>Walking</HI> is properly the progre&s;&s;ive motion of a living creature, by which, from an inward principle or power, it carries it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> from one place to another; and is oppo&s;ed to &s;itting down, or &s;tanding &s;till: and is therefore u&s;ed for that cour&s;e of life which men do lead, which is called the <HI>way</HI> they walk in; for walking ever &s;uppo|&s;eth a way. It al&s;o &s;uppo&s;eth the motion to be <HI>&s;pontaneous,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to that which is <HI>violent</HI> or compul&s;ive; and &s;o in voluntary agents, it points to that cour&s;e of life which they follow upon choice; and it tells us, <HI>that a Chri&s;tian is not to &s;tand &s;till, but to pur&s;ue his way with freedom of &s;pirit, if ever he hopes to obtain his great end.</HI> To walk with another is u&s;ed for our conver&s;ing with him, and u&s;ing of his familiarity, &s;o <HI>Prov.</HI> 13 20. <HI>He that walketh with the wi&s;e, &s;hall be wi&s;e.</HI> It there|fore &s;uppo&s;eth friend&s;hip and intimacy, and a likene&s;s of manners in the per&s;ons &s;o a&s;+&s;ociating; and on this account, <HI>Walking with God intends, a &s;o ordering of our Conver&s;ation,
<PB N="8" REF="001036_0007_0FAEE9D10D7D4EE0">
as is according to his will</HI>; or, a &s;o living as to have fellow&s;hip with him in all that we do; on this account it is &s;aid, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 1.3. <HI>Truly our fellow&s;hip is with God the Father, and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Or, an endeavouring &s;o to live that we may plea&s;e him, and enjoy his favourable pre&s;ence with us: for, it is not his E&s;&s;ential pre&s;ence which is here de|&s;igned, but the pre&s;ence of his love, and his acceptance of us. The Apo&s;tle therefore in the fore cited <HI>Heb</HI> 11.5. interprets his <HI>walk|ing with God,</HI> by his <HI>plea&s;ing of God.</HI> Now, we then plea&s;e God, when we always do the things that plea&s;e him; and he walks with us, when he &s;ignifies to and in us, that he takes delight in us; hence that of Chri&s;t, <HI>Job.</HI> 8.29. <HI>The Father hath not left me alone, for I do always tho&s;e things that plea&s;e him.</HI> Hence this is &s;et forth in other terms in Scripture, all of which are but Commenta|ries on this. Sometimes to <HI>walk in the ways of God. I&s;a</HI> 3.2. <HI>i. e.</HI> in tho&s;e ways which he hath commanded us, and wherein we con|form to his will: to <HI>walk in his law, P&s;al.</HI> 119 1. <HI>i. e.</HI> to follow that law which he hath revealed to us for the ordering of our Con|ver&s;ation by; to <HI>walk in good works, Eph.</HI> 2.10 <HI>i e.</HI> to exerci&s;e our &s;elves in &s;uch works as God approves of; to <HI>walk in our integrity, P&s;al.</HI> 26.1. <HI>i. e.</HI> in the practice of &s;incere O|bedience
<PB N="9" REF="001036_0008_0FAEE9D1CC93BA00">
to God; and many expre&s;&s;ions of like import. So that in &s;umme, we are then properly &s;aid to walk with God, when we con&s;tantly nouri&s;h true piety in our hearts, and pur&s;ue it in our whole lives. This then is the matter about which we are now en|quiring; and for our help and direction in which, the following <HI>Rules</HI> are to be ob|&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>That we may walk with God, we mu&s;t take care that he and we are reconciled.</HI> Walk|ing together &s;ignifies, and pre&s;uppo&s;eth friend|&s;hip and agreement; hence that, <HI>Amos</HI> 3.3. <HI>Can two walk together except they be agreed?</HI> If therefore there hath been a di&s;cord be|tween them before, it pre&s;umes that there hath been a making up of the breach, and bringing of them together again: and &s;o it is in the ca&s;e before us. Here then let us ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the &s;tate of nature is a &s;tate of alie|nation from God.</HI> Not that mans primitive &s;tate was &s;uch, for <HI>God made man upright, Eccl.</HI> 7.29. There was a Covenant of amity between God and man at fir&s;t; but mans Apo&s;ta&s;y hath violated that Covenant, and &s;o hath procured a great di&s;tance between them, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 59 2. <HI>Your &s;ins have &s;eparated be|tween you and your God.</HI> And at this di&s;tance
<PB N="10" REF="001036_0009_0FAEE9D42250B2D0">
is every natural man born, as he comes out of the loins of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> hence that is univer&s;ally a truth, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.3. <HI>Were Children of wrath by nature.</HI> On this account Unre|generate men are &s;aid to be <HI>far off from God, P&s;al.</HI> 73.27. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.13. In this regard al&s;o ungodly men have the &s;tile of <HI>Enemies</HI> put upon them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.10. <HI>Whiles we were yet enemies,</HI> &amp;c. And good rea&s;on, for man is by his &s;in revolted from God, hath broken his Allegiance, which hath both filled him with enmity again&s;t him, for &s;uch is the frame of <HI>them that are carnally minded, Rom.</HI> 8 7. and incen&s;ed the ju&s;t indignation of God again&s;t them, for we are told in, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 7.11. <HI>God is angry with the wicked every day.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That &s;o long as this alienation abides, there can be no Communion between God and Sinners.</HI> Communion between per&s;on ever &s;uppo&s;eth an union going before, which is the foun|dation of it: and where there hath been an ancecedent &s;eparation, it requires an a|tonement, in order to which that which made the difference mu&s;t be removed. God and Sinners go two ways, they <HI>walk contrary one to another,</HI> and God requires that they do acknowledge that it hath been &s;o, <HI>Levit.</HI> 26.40. How then &s;hould they go together? Whiles then things remain in this po&s;ture, the di&s;tance mu&s;t needs abide; yea it mu&s;t en|crea&s;e,
<PB N="11" REF="001036_0010_0FAEE9D52F1B5B50">
for &s;inful man is not only naturally afar off, but he is continually going further: hence the way that they are in is called <HI>a departing from the Living God, Heb.</HI> 3.12. and a <HI>for&s;a+king of the fountain of living waters.</HI> Jer. 2.13.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That this Reconciliation mu&s;t be mutual.</HI> And the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e the alienation was &s;o; <HI>Zech</HI> 11.8. <HI>My Soul loathed them, and their Soul al&s;o abhorred me.</HI> Gods anger is kindled again&s;t the Sinner, and how &s;hould he come at him, whiles this abide? as long as that fire burneth again&s;t him, there is no approaching to it, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12 <HI>ult. Our God is a con&s;uming fire.</HI> The P&s;almi&s;t intimates how dangerous a thing it is, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 76.7. <HI>Who may &s;tand in thy &s;ight when once thou art angry?</HI> The Sinner al&s;o is full of prejudices at God, hath taken up fal&s;e opinions of him, and &s;o long as the&s;e abide, he will not come unto him, but hide out of his &s;ight, as our fir&s;t Parents did as &s;oon as they had violated his Com|mand. God therefore mu&s;t be at peace with the Sinner, and the Sinner at peace with him, if ever the breach be made up between them.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>Chri&s;t having reconciled the Ju&s;tice of God by his Obedience, invites Sinners by the Go&s;|pel, to be reconciled to God</HI> Mans &s;in had ar|med the revenging Ju&s;tice of God again&s;t him, which was engaged to de&s;troy him;
<PB N="12" REF="001036_0011_0FAEE9D6B1F20E78">
till this was &s;atisfied, there was no hope of agreement: this therefore was fir&s;t done by Chri&s;t as our Surety, who &s;tanding in our room, an&s;wered all the demands of the Law for us, and now God is ready to receive Sin|ners into favour upon terms; <HI>Col.</HI> 1.21, 22. <HI>You that were &s;ometimes alienated, and enemies in your minds by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled, in the body of his fle&s;h, through death.</HI> 2 Cor. 5.19 <HI>God was in Chri&s;t reconciling the world to him&s;elf.</HI> Now Ju&s;tice and Mercy can meet together and agree: But this did not compleat the affair, but upon the former, Chri&s;t, in pur&s;uit of his Mediator&s;hip, opens a treaty of peace and by the Go&s;pel he pro|claimeth it to Sinners and Rebels, offering the atonement, and &s;olliciting them to em|brace it; for which he hath delegated his Amba&s;&s;adours, whom he hath Commi&s;&s;ion|ed thereto, and we are told what is the de|&s;ign of their Emba&s;&s;y, 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 5.20. <HI>We are Amba&s;&s;adours for Christ, as though God did be|&s;eech you by us, we pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, be ye reconciled to God</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The terms on which this Reconciliation is to be made, are offered in the New Covenant.</HI> God doth not only offer Sinners to be at peace with them, but maketh propo&s;als of agreement, on which he is ready to lay a&s;ide all differences, and receive them into favour,
<PB N="13" REF="001036_0012_0FAEE9D718BFCCD8">
and intimate fellow&s;hip. He treats with men in a Covenant way, in which the peace is to be ratified between them; and there are the <HI>Articles</HI> of it, which mu&s;t be compli|ed withal it ever they unite. The Go&s;pel promi&s;es are therefore propo&s;ed Hypotheti|cally, and a threatning in ca&s;e of failure, <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. <HI>He that believes &s;hall be &s;aved, and he that believes not &s;hall be damned</HI>; and <HI>Rom</HI> 8.13 <HI>If ye live after the fle&s;h ye &s;hall die, but if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the fle&s;h, ye &s;hall live.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Hence by our cordial clo&s;ing with the&s;e terms, we are again made nigh unto God.</HI> It is the blood of Chri&s;t which is the procuring cau&s;e of this, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2 13 <HI>Ye who were &s;ome|times afar off, are made nigh by the Blood of Chri&s;t</HI>; but the actual accompli&s;hment of it is brought about by our entertaining of the offered Grace, according to the tenour of the Go&s;pel Covenant. We therefore no &s;ooner repent and believe, but we are at peace with God, <HI>his anger is turned away,</HI> and he receives us into favour. We are by this faith united to Chri&s;t, and &s;o become the Children of God, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.26. <HI>For ye are all the Children of God by faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>: And now he carries it as a father to us and we may with a Child-like boldne&s;s approach near unto him, and maintain fellow&s;hip with
<PB N="14" REF="001036_0013_0FAEE9D84B6FFA80">
him, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.12. <HI>In whom we have boldne&s;s, and acce&s;s with confidence, through the faith of him.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>That we may thus embrace the&s;e terms, we mu&s;t wait upon God for his Grace and Spirit, to work this Faith and Repentance in us.</HI> As we could do nothing for the reconciling of God to us, &amp; if Chri&s;t had not done it for us, it had never been; &s;o neither can we reconcile our &s;elves to him, or comply with the propo&s;als of the New Covenant, of our &s;elves: We have neither ability nor inclination hereunto; hence that in, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.8 <HI>By Grace are ye &s;a|ved through faith, and that not of your &s;elves, it is the gift of God</HI> Acts 5.31. <HI>Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to I&s;rael, and for|givene&s;s of &s;ins</HI> It is therefore the Spirits work to make application of that Grace to us, by which we may be wrought up to a compliance with the calls of the Go&s;pel; and it is our duty to renounce tru&s;t in our &s;elves, and &s;eek for his help, waiting on him in all the ways of his appointment, for his coming and doing of this great thing for us: and when once this is effectually wrought in us, we are then fitted for communion with him.</P>
<P N="2">II <HI>If we would walk with God, we must carefully avoid all tho&s;e things that tend to make a distance between him and us.</HI> It is true, that
<PB N="15" REF="001036_0014_0FAEE9D8DA4C48D8">
when once we are reconciled to God by the Blood of Chri&s;t, and the powerful virtue of the Spirit in us, bringing us over to a cordial compliance with the terms of the New Co|venant, there &s;hall never be a total breach made between him and us, his Omni|potency will keep us from it, 1 Pet. 1 5. <HI>Ye are kept by the power of God through &s;aith unto &s;alvation.</HI> However, there may be di&s;tances procured, and uncomfortable breaches made, the Communion be interrupted, and we thereupon lo&s;e our &s;ight of him; and though there be the Soveraign withdrawings of his light and comfort from his own, when they are watchful over them&s;elves; yet there are the things which provoke him to hide away, and carry him&s;elf to them as an Enemy: and if we would prevent this, we mu&s;t be watchful again&s;t all tho&s;e carriages which will procure it. And to this end,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us carefully avoid every &s;in; and more peculiarly every bold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI> As it was &s;in that at fir&s;t made the breach between God and man, &s;o it hath always a tendency in it to produce this effect, becau&s;e it is a thing &s;o contrary to his Holine&s;s, according as is declared, <HI>Hab.</HI> 1 13. <HI>Thou art of parer eyes than to beheld evil, and can&s;t not look on ini|quity.</HI> And although God hath a <HI>fathers pity</HI> to extend to all tho&s;e <HI>his Children which &s;erve
<PB N="16" REF="001036_0015_0FAEE9D962DF42E8">
him,</HI> and accordingly hath a regard to their <HI>frames,</HI> as <HI>P&s;al</HI> 103.13, 14. And therefore will accept of their integrity, and bear witne&s;s to it, notwith&s;tanding the deficiency which at|tends upon their be&s;t, yet if at any time they allow them&s;elves in any pre&s;umptuous &s;in, it will incen&s;e his righteous di&s;plea&s;ure at them, and procure for them &s;ome remarka|ble de&s;ertion: we read in 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 11. <HI>ult. The thing which David did di&s;plea&s;ed the Lord.</HI> And what awful Di&s;pen&s;ations in his Providence followed upon it, is recorded in the Hi&s;tory: what care then ought we to u&s;e on this ac|count, le&s;t we be drawn into any iniquity?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us pur&s;ue the mortification of every fle&s;hly lust.</HI> Though the Dominion of &s;in is &s;ubverted in every Regenerate one, yet there are the remains of it in the be&s;t in this life; &amp; it is very active, and hath too much of the nature of a Law in them, as he confe&s;&s;eth of him&s;elf, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.21. <HI>I find a law, that when I would do good, evil is pre&s;ent with me.</HI> The be&s;t way for a Chri&s;tian to avoid the Com|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, is to endeavour the mortifi|cation of tho&s;e lu&s;ts which are the branches of Original Concupi&s;cence in him, by the motions and force whereof he is hurried in|to actual &s;ins. That is on this account made the Duty of all the People of God in, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.5. <HI>Mortify your members which are upon the

10.38. <HI>The Ju&s;t &s;hall live by his faith.</HI> Where, by living is not only intended, the enjoyment of the title to Everla&s;ting Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, which is &s;ecured by promi&s;e to faith in Chri&s;t, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. <HI>Who&s;oever believes in him &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everlasting Life</HI>; but al&s;o the main|taining of a life of Holine&s;s, in which alone it is that we can be &s;aid to walk with God, and becau&s;e this is an e&s;&s;ential point, let us con&s;ider it in the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is no walking with God, but in the way of new Obedience.</HI> There was an Obedi|ence which God required of man in the Co|venant of Works, in the performance of which, if he had kept his integrity, he &s;hould have upheld entire Communion with God; and that was in an exact conformity to the Law of that Covenant. But fallen man cannot maintain this; <HI>he is fallen &s;hort of the Glory of God,</HI> and can no more conform to the Law: We are therefore told. <HI>Gal</HI> 3.10. <HI>As many as are of the works of the Law, are under the Cur&s;e.</HI> There is therefore a new Covenant opened, in which, as there is O|bedience to God required of us, &s;o it is up|on another tenour, in which &s;incerity is ac|cepted at our hands by God, and all our &s;hort comings are over looked: and it is for that rea&s;on called new, becau&s;e there was nothing of it in the Old Covenant which
<PB N="25" REF="001036_0024_0FAEE9E1C3707A58">
pronounced a Cur&s;e upon the lea&s;t defect. Of this is that ble&s;&s;ing pronounced, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 119. 1, 2, 3. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the way of the Lord, &amp;c.</HI> and for this he prays in, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 25.22. <HI>Let integrity and uprightne&s;s pre&s;erve me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There is no performing of &s;incere Obedience but by the help of Chri&s;t.</HI> He mu&s;t work our works in us, if ever we do them as we ought. As all the operation of &s;econd Be|ings depends on the Co operation of the fir&s;t, even in things natural; &s;o the Gracious Actions of the Children of God mu&s;t have their &s;upply from Chri&s;t, through whom all &s;aving benefits derive to his people: he is the <HI>Vine</HI> and they are the <HI>branches, Joh</HI> 15. <HI>begin.</HI> And all the Sap which they have that mu&s;t render them fruitful comes from him, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 14.8. <HI>From me is thy fruit found. Paul</HI> therefore dares not to pre&s;ume any further for his doing of any duty, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.13. <HI>I can do all things through Chri&s;t &s;trengthening of me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is by Faith that we mu&s;t derive all this vertue and help from him.</HI> As all our help is fountained in him, &s;o there is a way in which we are to fetch it in from him, and that is by the exerci&s;e of faith on him: and for this rea&s;on, <HI>Paul,</HI> when he &s;peaks of his life of Holine&s;s in which he walked with God, refers it hither, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.20. <HI>I live, yet not
<PB N="26" REF="001036_0025_0FAEE9E263BA9370">
I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me, and the life which I now live in the fle&s;h, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</HI> The Obedience of Gods peo|ple is on this account called the <HI>work of faith,</HI> 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 1.11. And all the glorious exploits which are mentioned to have been done by the Worthies of old, are a&s;cribed to their faith in, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. For it is by faith that we go to Chri&s;t, and embracing the promi&s;e, in which all the help that we need is laid up, we fetch in that a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him, by which we are enabled to walk with him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The be&s;t of our Obedience labours of &s;inful infirmities, and imperfections.</HI> It is by <HI>the law that we have the knowledge of &s;in</HI>; accordingly we are to reckon that what&s;oever comes &s;hort, in any re&s;pect, of what that re|quires, whether in matter or manner, or end, is &s;o far &s;inful. Now the people of God, when they have exerci&s;ed their Grace with the mo&s;t &s;incere endeavour, come be|hind in this re&s;pect, and &s;o dare not to put them&s;elves upon a law tryal, but confe&s;s as, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 130.3. <HI>If thou, Lord, &s;hould mark iniqui|ties; Oh Lord, who &s;hall &s;tand?</HI> And there|fore deprecate it as, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 143.2. <HI>Enter not in|to judgment with thy &s;ervant, for in thy &s;ight &s;hall no man living be ju&s;tified.</HI> Sinle&s;s perfe|ction is that which none can with any truth pretend unto, for we are told, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.8. <HI>If
<PB N="27" REF="001036_0026_0FAEE9E3210C8688">
we &s;ay that we have no &s;in, we deceive our &s;elves, and the truth is not in us.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>This imperfect Obedience, when &s;incere, is rendred acceptable to God through Chri&s;t.</HI> God, out of Chri&s;t, is a &s;evere Judge, and con|demns men for the lea&s;t defect in what they do: whereas believers have hope of accep|tance, notwith&s;tanding they find &s;o much of a body of death mixing with their duties: and whence is this? not becau&s;e God likes &s;in in his own, when he cannot endure it in others; his Holine&s;s forbids that: But it is, becau&s;e he looks upon them in Chri&s;t, and having covered them under the robe of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, he will not &s;ee, &s;o as to judge them for their frailties, according to, <HI>Numb.</HI> 23.21. <HI>He hath &s;een no iniquity in Jacob, nor perver&s;ene&s;s in I&s;rael</HI>; but we have <HI>all our ac|ceptance in the beloved, Eph.</HI> 1.6.</P>
<P N="6">6 <HI>It is only by faith that we apply this per|fect Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t by which we are thus accepted</HI> Hence that title is put upon it, <HI>Phil</HI> 3.9. <HI>The Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith.</HI> If we confide in our own works, and expect to be accepted for the worthine&s;s of them, God will de&s;pi&s;e us, and wholly re|ject our &s;ervices as things which he can take no delight in: but when we utterly renounce our affiance in them, and re&s;olve our whole hope, after all, into Chri&s;t, and him alone,
<PB N="28" REF="001036_0027_0FAEE9E3CE7E3C50">
we then plea&s;e God. We thus comply with the New-Covenant way, in which the Grace of God is every way exalted, and our whole acknowledgment is paid to it: and when we thus do, we <HI>Walk by faith,</HI> and &s;o <HI>Walk with God.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>If we would Walk with God, we mu&s;t endeavour to conform our whole Conver&s;ation to his revealed will.</HI> We before ob&s;erved, that walking intends the cour&s;e of life which we follow, every action whereof incompared to one &s;tep that we take. Walking with God then, is a living according to his will, &s;o it is expre&s;t in, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.2. <HI>That he no longer &s;hould live the re&s;t of his time in the fle&s;h, to the lu&s;ts of men, but to the will of God.</HI> Now there is a double-con&s;ideration of the Will of God, <HI>viz</HI> as it is &s;ecret, or as it is reveal|ed; by the former of which God di&s;po&s;eth of all the affairs of his Creatures, according to his infinite wi&s;dom, and good plea&s;ure, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.11. <HI>Who worketh all things after the coun&s;el of his will.</HI> And by the latter he pre|&s;cribes to us our Duty, and how we ought to carry towards him in all things.

<P N="1">1. <HI>That God hath given us a Rule to direct us in the way wherein we may walk with him.</HI> He hath not only enjoyned it upon us as a

duty &s;o to walk, but hath al&s;o &s;hewn us the way in which we may &s;o do; el&s;e we had been left at an utter lo&s;s. Nor did he only do &s;o to man when he fir&s;t created him, by the Covenant of Works, for compliance wherewithal fallen man is left altogether <HI>without &s;trength</HI>: but he hath al&s;o thus pre|&s;cribed under the New Covenant, which is therefore called <HI>the law of Christ, Gal.</HI> 6 2. For the Go&s;pel doth not di&s;charge man from obedience to God, and &s;o open to him a door of licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and they are grievou&s;ly mi&s;taken who reckon this for the Grace of the Go&s;pel: but it pre&s;cribes unto them a new way, in which <HI>they may live and plea&s;e God:</HI> which is called <HI>the way of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> 2 Pet. 2.2. &amp; <HI>the way of peace, Luk</HI> 1.69 <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.17. and <HI>the way of Salvation, Acts</HI> 17.16. Nor hath he left it a thing indifferent, whe|ther we go in this way or no; but hath ad|ded <HI>Sanctions</HI> to the Command.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That this Rule extends to the whole man.</HI> For this rea&s;on, the Sanctification, which is to furni&s;h us with ability to conform to this Rule, extends to the whole, 1 <HI>The&s;</HI> 5.23 <HI>The very God of peace &s;anctify you wholly, and I pray God that your whole &s;pirit, &s;oul and body be kept blamele&s;s.</HI> Man con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;oul and a body; and both of the&s;e are to be regulated by it: It therefore giveth precepts concern|ing

the inward as well as the outward man; and we are obliged to glorify God with both, 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 6.20. <HI>Glorify God in your body, and in your &s;pirit, which are Gods.</HI> There is a way of the heart as well as of the hand and foot, which we mu&s;t take heed to, if we would walk with God; and indeed God fir&s;tly and mainly regards the heart in all; and our outward actions, let them be otherwi&s;e never &s;o regular, are no further accepted with him, than our heart is right in them. God there|fore requires this in the fir&s;t place, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.26. <HI>My &s;on, give me thine heart</HI> And this is a remark that is made on the &s;pecious refor|mation attempted by <HI>I&s;rael, P&s;al</HI> 78.37. <HI>Their heart was not right with him</HI>; and if our feet move one way, and our heart goes another, God is not honoured, but de&s;pi&s;ed by us; &s;o he upbraids them <HI>I&s;a</HI> 29.13 <HI>This people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>Hence it gives laws to all &s;orts of actions.</HI> As the whole man is under the command of it, &s;o all the motions of it, in all re&s;pects, are to be regulated by it; and we no farther walk with God than we &s;incerely conform to it.

<P N="1">1. <HI>We mu&s;t u&s;e all endeavours to get a di&s;tinct acquaintance with the Rules of holy walking.</HI> Though knowledge alone be not &s;ufficient for us, for we may know our duty, and yet live in the neglect of it, which will but ag|gravate our guilt, yet <HI>without knowledge the mind of man cannot be good</HI>; nor his actions regular; tho&s;e therefore are put together, <HI>Joh.</HI> 13 17. <HI>If ye know the&s;e things, happy are ye if ye do them.</HI> And for this end,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We mu&s;t be diligent in reading the Word of God.</HI> That is the compleat Rule of our walking with him, and without our
<PB N="34" REF="001036_0033_0FAEE9EB4EFD5378">
getting acquaintance with it, we mu&s;t needs err; for, if God had not there &s;hewn us what is good, we mu&s;t have wandered in a labyrinth of mi&s;takes: <HI>David</HI> re&s;olves upon this, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119 16 <HI>I will delight my &s;elf in thy statutes; I will not forget thy word.</HI> And he tells us what u&s;e he makes of it, <HI>v</HI> 105. <HI>Thy Word is a lamp to my feet, and a light unto my path.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We mu&s;t be frequent in meditation on the Word of God.</HI> It is not enough for us cur&s;o|rily to read it, and &s;et our &s;elves a &s;tint of &s;o doing, but we mu&s;t do it with under&s;tanding &amp; con&s;ideration; how el&s;e &s;hould it be our guide in the paths of peace? <HI>David</HI> re&s;olveth on this. <HI>P&s;al</HI> 119 15. <HI>I will meditate in thy pre|cepts, and have re&s;pect unto thy ways</HI>; and he tells us for what end he did it, <HI>v.</HI> 11. <HI>Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not &s;in a|gain&s;t thee</HI>; and to what a degree of acquain|tance with it he arrived by this cour&s;e, he tells us, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 99. <HI>I have more under&s;tanding than all my teachers, for thy te&s;timonies are my meditation.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We mu&s;t be careful in attending on the preach|ing of the Word.</HI> God hath appointed the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try for this end, that they may be helpful in acquainting us with his mind; &amp; when he be&s;tows &s;uch upon us, it is a great ble&s;&s;ing; he therefore promi&s;ed that in bet|ter

times, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.15. <HI>I will give you Pa&s;tors ac|cording to mine heart, which &s;hall feed you with knowledge and under&s;tanding</HI>; and he hath ac|cordingly made it our duty to afford all di|ligent &amp; ponderous attention upon the Preach|ing of his Word, that we may thereby get acquaintance with his mind; &amp; he hath de|clared all &s;uch to be ble&s;&s;ed ones who do faith|fully comply therewithal, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.34. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the po&s;ts of my doors.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>We mu&s;t joyn to all prayer for the Spirit of Illumination to be afforded us.</HI> We do not on|ly &s;tand in need of the Word and Ordinan|ces to inform us about the will of God, tho' the matter of the knowledge of it is therein contained <HI>Doctrinally</HI>; but of the Spirit too, to give us a right di&s;cerning: for we are na|turally blind in &s;piritual things, and &s;o need not only light to be &s;et before us, but our eyes to be re&s;tored that we may perceive it. And though there is a remainder of the light of nature in us, which can apprehend the rea|&s;on of many <HI>moral Duties,</HI> yet we are alto|gether &s;trangers to the way of <HI>Evangelical Obedience,</HI> by which alone we can walk with God: this therefore <HI>Paul</HI> prays for on their behalf, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1 17, 18. <HI>That the Father may give to them the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and revelation in the knowledge of him; the eyes of your under&s;tand|ings

being enlightned, &amp;c.</HI> And good rea&s;on; for he tells us in, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2 14 <HI>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; nei|ther can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritu|ally di&s;cerned.</HI> Surely then we &s;hould pray for it in re&s;pect of our &s;elves, in the words of the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 119 18 <HI>Open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>We mu&s;t corroborate our love to the Rule.</HI> It is not enough to have a Theoretical know|ledge of it, for it is certain that we &s;hall con|form unto it no farther than we love it: The natural man is offended at the <HI>Rule</HI> of Obe|dience given us by God; his heart ri&s;eth up again&s;t it, he hath entertained prejudices at it, yea is a meer lump of ermity, as he is de|&s;cribed, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.7. <HI>The carnal mind is enmity a|gain&s;t God, for it is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</HI> And &s;o much as there is of the law of &s;in remaining in the be&s;t; &s;o far is their love defective &amp; &s;tands in need of fortifying. And here ob&s;erve</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That all &s;incere Obedience is the exerci&s;e of love.</HI> Faith indeed regulates our Obedience, but it is love that acts it, according to <HI>Gal</HI> 5.6. <HI>Faith that worketh by love.</HI> We walk with God in no duty any farther than we do it in love, for we are told in, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13 10. <HI>Love is the ful|filling of the law</HI> And for this rea&s;on all O|bedience is called by the name of love, and
<PB N="37" REF="001036_0036_0FAEE9ED9321EB30">
put di&s;tributively with faith, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1 13. <HI>Faith and love which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI>; and the A|po&s;tle <HI>John</HI> &s;o argues, 1 <HI>Joh</HI> 4.7, 8. <HI>Love is of God, &amp; every one that loveth is born of God, &amp; knoweth God; he that loveth not, knoweth not God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence we no farther plea&s;e God, than we are acted by this love in our Duties.</HI> We may be very circum&s;pect in the matter of them, and critical to the very tithing of mint, an|ni&s;e and cummin, and take a great deal of pains in the performance of it; but &s;till, if this principle doth not influence them, God will not take the lea&s;t content therein; and good rea&s;on, for love is the very life of the precept, and obedience thereto is deno|minated by it, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.37, 38 <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp; with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind; this is the fir&s;t and great Commandment.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That we may &s;o do, we must get per&s;waded of the excellency of the Rule, and the felicity of them that delight them&s;elves in it.</HI> It is the loveline&s;s of the object that attracts our love to it; and we mu&s;t di&s;cern that in it which renders it &s;o, in order to our union with it. We have <HI>David</HI> profe&s;&s;ing of his inexpre&s;&s;ible love to this Rule, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.97. <HI>Oh, how I love thy law!</HI> And no wonder that he was thus rai&s;ed in his mind, for he could
<PB N="38" REF="001036_0037_0FAEE9EE51F64440">
give that incomparable encomium of it, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19.7, <HI>&amp;c. The law of God is perfect, &amp;c. More to be de&s;ired than gold, yea than much fine gold, &s;weeter al&s;o than the honey, and the honey comb.</HI> And that we may keep up this value, we mu&s;t look upon it as the great medium of Communion with God in this life; and if we love that above all things, we &s;hall prize this for that rea&s;on proportionably.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>We mu&s;t be very accurate in all our acti|ons, to &s;ee that they comport with the precept.</HI> The Word of God is a Rule of life, and no farther profiteth us than as we order our Conver&s;ation according to it: and for this we ought to take great heed to its coun&s;els, and accordingly lay out all our actions by it: to do nothing but by the direction of it, and to bring all that we have done to the trial of it; &amp; this is that accurate walking which is commended to us, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.15. <HI>See that you walk circum&s;pectly</HI>; for if we depart from this Rule, we therein depart from God. And there are two things e&s;pecially that we are to be curious about in this affair.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>About the matter of them.</HI> God hath told us what we &s;hould do, and what we are to avoid, if we would plea&s;e him in our Conver&s;ation; and there is much of curio&s;i|ty to be u&s;ed by us in this, if we would not mi&s;s in our endeavours. For though we may
<PB N="39" REF="001036_0038_0FAEE9EF127D5660">
do the matter of duty very plau&s;ibly and without blame from men, or our own Con|&s;ciences in that regard, and yet &s;in, for want of all other requi&s;ites to render it conforma|ble to the precept; yet if we neglect or tran&s;gre&s;s that, we &s;in unavoidably. We are forbidden to add or dimini&s;h, <HI>Deut.</HI> 12 32. <HI>What thing &s;oever I command you, ob&s;erve to do it; thou &s;halt not add thereto, nor dimini&s;h from it.</HI> And we are limited hither, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 8 20 <HI>To the law, and to the te&s;timony; if they &s;peak not according to this word, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In the &s;incere aim of them.</HI> We then on|ly keep with God in our actions, when we pur&s;ue the &s;ame end in them for which he pre&s;cribes them: And though no pretence of a good end, and aiming at the glory of God in it, or the benefit of others, will gain the Divine approbation for any thing which is in it &s;elf a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; yet a &s;ini&s;ter end in the doing of it, will &s;poil that which is o|therwi&s;e a Duty. God always ob&s;erves, not only what we do, but what we do it for; and if we fail in that point, he will make his re|mark upon it, <HI>Zech</HI> 7.5 <HI>When ye fa&s;ted and mourned, &amp;c. did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?</HI> It &s;poileth prayers &amp; alms when they are done to <HI>be &s;een of men, Mat</HI> 6. <HI>beg.</HI> That then is to be fixed in our hearts in all our act|ions
<PB N="40" REF="001036_0039_0FAEE9F2891E1370">
of all &s;orts, if we would keep with God in them, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10 31. <HI>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>If we would walk with God, we must be much in the&s;e duties wherein clo&s;e communion with him is to be upheld.</HI> Although we are to follow him in all duties, yet there are &s;ome in which we &s;eparate our &s;elves for &s;pecial intimacy with him, in which he is wont more pecu|liarly to manife&s;t him&s;elf to his people, when they carefully &s;eek him in them. And the more &s;pecial of the&s;e are;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Secret Prayer.</HI> Prayer is in the Scrip|tures called <HI>a drawing nigh to God,</HI> becau&s;e in it we pre&s;ent our &s;elves before him, and put up our petitions to him. Praying is an act of Divine Wor&s;hip, and that in all the kinds of it; and God hath made it to be a medium of participation in his favour; and therefore when he had made large promi&s;es of ble&s;&s;ings to his people, he tells them how they may come by them, <HI>Ezek</HI> 36 37. <HI>I will yet for this be enquired of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, to do it for them.</HI> And of all prayers there are none in which a Child of God hath more of free|dom and intimacy with him, than in tho&s;e that are performed in &s;ecret. We are there|fore directed to and about this &s;ort of prayer, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6 6. Here we may pour out our hearts
<PB N="41" REF="001036_0040_0FAEE9F454098C10">
before him; here we may open all our ca&s;es with the greate&s;t freedom, whiles there's none that &s;tands by to upbraid or di&s;|courage us; and the more we are &s;incerely engaged in this Duty, the oftner &s;hall we be in the Mount where God is, and have inti|mate conver&s;e with him; &amp; if we have not a great deal of &s;uch private bu&s;ine&s;s with God every day, it is an ill &s;ign that we do not walk with him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Diligent attendance on the Ordinances of his hou&s;e.</HI> If we would walk with God, we mu&s;t repair thither where his goings are: and we are told, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 68 24. <HI>They have &s;een thy goings Oh God, in the Sanctuary.</HI> And 77.13. <HI>Thy way, O God is in the Sanctuary.</HI> Here it is that he makes peculiar manife&s;tations of his grace and love to his people; here he hath com|manded the ble&s;&s;ing, &amp; hath therefore promi|&s;ed his pre&s;ence to be with &s;uch for this end, <HI>Exo.</HI> 20.24. <HI>In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will ble&s;s thee</HI> This was the rea&s;on why the P&s;almi&s;t de&s;ired it as a peculiar priviledge to <HI>dwell all his days in the hou&s;e of God, P&s;al.</HI> 27 4. <HI>To behold the beau|ty of the Lord</HI>; and in his exile he envies <HI>Swallows</HI> and <HI>Sparrows</HI> their liberty of build|ing near the <HI>Altar, P&s;al.</HI> 84 3. And why? but becau&s;e he counted them to be happy men who were &s;o priviledged, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 4 <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed

are they that dwell in thine hou&s;e.</HI> It was there|fore that he might have a refre&s;hing &s;ight of God that his Soul &s;o <HI>longed</HI> and <HI>thir&s;ted, P&s;al.</HI> 63.2. <HI>To &s;ee thy power and thy glory, &s;o as I have &s;een thee in thy Sanctuary.</HI> Only if we would enjoy this benefit when we come there, we mu&s;t be &s;ure that we make this our bu&s;ine&s;s; that it be our very errand to his hou&s;e, to get into his company and fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Spiritual Communion with &s;uch as walk with him.</HI> We before ob&s;erved, that if we make ungodly men our companions, it will be the readie&s;t way to lo&s;e Gods company: and we may here further take notice, that to be much with tho&s;e that fear him, is the way to be near him. If we take heed that our frequent and intimate fellow&s;hip be with them who&s;e fellow&s;hip is with God, we are then of that &s;ociety in which he delights; for we are told, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 25.14. <HI>The &s;ecret of the Lord is with them that fear him</HI>; and this is the argument u&s;ed by the Apo&s;tle to invite tho&s;e whom he writes to, into the fellow&s;hip of the Saints, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.3. <HI>Truly our fellow&s;hip is with God the Father, and with his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Only ob&s;erve, that it is not enough to a&s;&s;ociate our &s;elves with their per|&s;ons; meer civil friend&s;hip will not advance this, but it mu&s;t be &s;piritual; for by that on|ly it is that they do mutually edify one ano|ther.
<PB N="43" REF="001036_0042_0FAEE9F5D69DAC40">
When we chu&s;e &s;uch as are gracious for our &s;ociety, and make it our endeavour to &s;tir up each others graces, and confer toge|ther about the <HI>Matters of the Kingdom,</HI> &s;eek|ing to warm each others hearts with holy &amp; heavenly di&s;cour&s;es, we &s;hall then have Chri&s;t to come and make one in the Company, as he did to tho&s;e <HI>two Di&s;ciples,</HI> who walked together, and talked of the affairs that con|cerned <HI>Chri&s;t; Luk.</HI> 24 14, 15. And were this Duty revived, which &s;o much langui&s;heth, and is &s;o little pur&s;ued, there would be a great deal more of clo&s;e walking with God a|mong Chri&s;tians, than there is.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Self examination, accompanied with renew|ed Repentance.</HI> And indeed it is requi&s;ite that the&s;e two be in conjunction; for there will be no kindly Repentance, but upon &s;elf reflecti|ons; and &s;erious calling of our &s;elves to an account daily, will promove the exerci&s;e of Repentance in us There is a great deal of folly breaking forth in our Conver&s;ation, when we take never &s;o much heed to our &s;elves, and much more when we are remi&s;s in our watch, which we are too often guilty of; in all of which we get &s;o far out of the way wherein God and we &s;hould go together &amp; till by Repentance we turn into it again, we keep at a di&s;tance from him: whiles then we take no heed to reckon with our &s;elves, this
<PB N="44" REF="001036_0043_0FAEE9F69934A300">
&s;eparation will abide, whereas they that are often calling of them&s;elves to a &s;trict account, enquiring where they are, what they have been doing, &amp; bring them&s;elves to the Rules of Tryal upon that account, are mo&s;t likely to go the lea&s;t away from God, and to make the &s;peedie&s;t returns to him. This was a practice which the P&s;almi&s;t accu&s;tomed him+&s;elf to, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.59. <HI>I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy te&s;timonies.</HI> No won|der then, if tho&s;e that are negligent in ac|quainting them&s;elves very often with them|&s;elves, do &s;o frequently &s;traggle away, and many times are a great while before they can recover their former communion with God.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>If we would walk with God, we mu&s;t endeavour to &s;ubordinate all our outward concerns to his guidance and government.</HI> We have ob|&s;erved, that this Duty extends to all that we have to do withal in this life. <HI>Enoch walked with God in his Oeconomical capacity</HI>; and it is certain, that a Chri&s;tian would be a great &s;ufferer by being obliged to the duties of his particular calling, which take up the bigger part of his time in this life, if his attendance thereupon would nece&s;&s;arily interrupt his Communion with God, but it is quite other|wi&s;e: and though it &s;o fails out too often, that through the prevalency of our concupi&s;|cence,

<P N="5">5. <HI>Let us be content to go alone.</HI> It is true, we cannot be alone, if we have God with us; however, as to men it may be &s;o. It is ob&s;ervable that this is the encomium that
