<P>His Maje&s;ty will withdraw all his troops and garri|&s;ons from all po&s;ts and places within the boundary lines a&s;&s;igned by the treaty of peace to the United States. This evacuation &s;hall take place on or before the fir&s;t day of June one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-&s;ix, and all the proper mea&s;ures &s;hall in the interval be taken by concert between the government of the United States, and his Maje&s;ty's Governor General in America, for &s;ettling the previous arrangements which may be nece&s;|&s;ary re&s;pecting the delivery of the &s;aid po&s;ts: The Uni|ted States in the mean time at their di&s;cretion, extend|ing their &s;ettlements to any part within the &s;aid bounda|ry line, except within the precincts or juri&s;diction of any of the &s;aid po&s;ts.

<P>It is agreed that it &s;hall at all times be free to his Ma|je&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and to the citizens of the United States, and al&s;o to the Indians dwelling on either &s;ide of the &s;aid boundary line, freely to pa&s;s and repa&s;s by land or

inland navigation, into the re&s;pective territories and countries of the two parties, on the continent of Ame|rica (the country within the limits of the Hud&s;on's bay Company only excepted) and to navigate all the lakes, rivers and waters thereof, and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other. But it is under&s;tood, that this article does not extend to the admi&s;&s;ion of ve&s;|&s;els of the United States into the &s;ea ports, harbours, bays, or creeks of his Maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories; nor in|to &s;uch parts of the rivers in his Maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories as are between the mouth thereof, and the highe&s;t port of entry from the &s;ea, except in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els trading bona &s;ide between Montreal and Quebec, under &s;uch regula|tions as &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of any frauds in this re&s;pect. Nor to the admi&s;&s;ion of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ea into the rivers of the United States, beyond the highe&s;t ports of entry for foreign ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ea. The river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, &s;hall, how|ever, according to the treaty of peace, be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on its ea&s;tern &s;ide, to which&s;oever of the parties belonging, may freely be re&s;orted to and u&s;ed by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the At|lantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his Maje&s;ty in Great-Britain.</P>
<P>All goods and merchandize who&s;e importation into his Maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories in America, &s;hall not be en|tirely prohibited, may freely, for the purpo&s;es of com|merce, be carried into the &s;ame in the manner afore&s;aid, by the citizens of the United States, and &s;uch goods and merchandize &s;hall be &s;ubject to no higher or other duties, than would be payable by his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects on the importation of the &s;ame from Europe into the &s;aid territories. And in like manner, all goods and mer|chandize who&s;e importation into the United States &s;hall not be wholly prohibited, may freely, for the purpo&s;es of commerce, be carried into the &s;ame, in the manner afore&s;aid, by his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and &s;uch goods and merchandize &s;hall be &s;ubject to no higher or other du|ties,

than would be payable by the citizens of the Uni|ted States on the importation of the &s;ame in American ve&s;&s;els into the Atlantic ports of the &s;aid States. And all goods not prohibited to be exported from the &s;aid territories re&s;pectively, may in like manner be carried out of the &s;ame by the two parties re&s;pectively, paying duty as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>No duty of entry &s;hall ever be levied by either party on peltries brought by land, or inland navigation into the &s;aid territories re&s;pectively, nor &s;hall the Indians pa&s;&s;ing or repa&s;&s;ing with their own proper goods and ef|fects of whatever nature, pay for the &s;ame any impo&s;t or duty whatever. But goods in bales, or other large packages unu&s;ual among Indians &s;hall not be con&s;idered as goods belonging bona fide to Indians.</P>
<P>No higher or other tolls or rates of ferriage than what are or &s;hall be payable by natives, &s;hall be demanded on either &s;ide; and no duties &s;hall be payable on any goods which &s;hall merely be carried over any of the portages or carrying places on either &s;ide; for the purpo&s;e of being immediately reimbarked and carried to &s;ome other place or places. But as by this &s;tipulation it is only meant to &s;ecure to each party a free pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the portages on both &s;ides; it is agreed, that this exemption from duty &s;hall extend only to &s;uch goods as are carried in the u&s;ual and direct road acro&s;s the portage, and are not attempted to be in any manner &s;old or exchanged during their pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the &s;ame, and proper regula|tions may be e&s;tabli&s;hed to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of any frauds in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>As this article is intended to render in a great degree the local advantages of each party common to both, and thereby to promote a di&s;po&s;ition favorable to friend&s;hip and good neighbourhood, it is agreed, that the re&s;pective governments will mutually promote this amicable intercour&s;e, by cau&s;ing &s;peedy and impartial ju&s;tice to be done, and nece&s;&s;ary protection to be ex|tended to all who may be concerned therein.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honored with yours of Augu&s;t 30th. Mine of the 7th of that month a&s;&s;ured you that mea&s;ures were taken for excluding from all further a&s;ylum in our ports, ve&s;&s;els armed in them to cruize on nations with which we are at peace, and for the re&s;toration of the prizes the Lovely La&s;s, Prince William Henry, and the Jane of Dublin; and that &s;hould the mea&s;ures for re&s;|titution fail in their effect, the Pre&s;ident con&s;idered it as incumbent on the United States to make compen&s;ation for the ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>We are bound by our treaties with three of the bel|ligerent nations, by all the means in our power to pro|tect and defend their ve&s;&s;els and effects in our ports, or waters, or on the &s;eas near our &s;hores, and to recover and re&s;tore the &s;ame to the right owners when taken from them. If all the means in our power are u&s;ed, and fail in their effect, we are not bound by our treaties with tho&s;e nations to make compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Though we have no &s;imilar treaty with Great-Britain, it was the opinion of the Pre&s;ident, that we &s;hould u&s;e towards that nation the &s;ame rule, which under this article, was to govern us with the other nations; and even to extend it to captures made on the high &s;eas, and brought into our ports: if done by ve&s;&s;els which had been armed within them.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="031411_0029_0FEC5158293F0178">Having, for particular rea&s;ons, forbore to u&s;e all the means in our power for the re&s;titution of the three ve&s;|&s;els mentioned in my letter of Augu&s;t 7th, the Pre&s;ident thought it incumbent on the United States to make com|pen&s;ation for them: And though nothing was &s;aid in that letter of other ve&s;&s;els taken under like circum|&s;tancces, and brought in after the 5th of June, and be|fore the date of that letter, yet when the &s;ame forbear|ance had taken place, it was and is his opinion, that compen&s;ation would be equally due.</P>
<P>As to prizes made under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, and brought in after the date of that letter, the Pre&s;ident de|termined, that all the means in our power &s;hould be u&s;ed for their re&s;titution. If the&s;e fail, as we &s;hould not be bound by our treaties to make compen&s;ation to the other powers in the analogous ca&s;e, he did not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be done to Great-Britain. But &s;till if any ca&s;es &s;hall ari&s;e &s;ub&s;equent to that date, the circum&s;tances of which &s;hall place them on &s;imilar ground with tho&s;e before it, the Pre&s;ident would think compen&s;ation equally incumbent on the United States.</P>
<P>In&s;tructions are given to the governors of the differ|ent &s;tates, to u&s;e all the means in their power for re&s;tor|ing prizes of this la&s;t de&s;cription found within their ports. Though they will of cour&s;e take mea&s;ures to be informed of them, and the general government has gi|ven them the aid of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers for this purpo&s;e, yet you will be &s;en&s;ible of the importance of multiplying the channels of their information as far as &s;hall depend on your&s;elf, or any per&s;on under your di|rection, in order that the governors may u&s;e the means in their power for making re&s;titution.</P>
<P>Without knowledge of the capture they cannot re|&s;tore it. It will always be be&s;t to give the notice to them directly; but any information which you &s;hall be plea|&s;ed to &s;end to me al&s;o at any time &s;hall be forwarded to them as quickly as di&s;tance will permit.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="031411_0030_0FEC5159D070ADE0">Hence you will perceive Sir, that the Pre&s;ident con|templates re&s;titution or compen&s;ation in the ca&s;e before the 7th Augu&s;t; and after that date, re&s;titution if it can be effected by any means in our power. And that it will be important that you &s;hould &s;ub&s;tantiate the fact, that &s;uch prizes are in our ports or waters.</P>
<P>Your li&s;t of privateers illicitly armed in our ports is, I believe, correct.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to lo&s;&s;es by detention, wa&s;te, &s;poliation &s;u&s;tained by ve&s;&s;els taken as before mentioned, between the dates of June 5th and Augu&s;t 7th, it is propo&s;ed as a provi&s;ional mea&s;ure, that the collector of the cu&s;toms of the di&s;trict, and the Briti&s;h con&s;ul, or any other per&s;on you plea&s;e, &s;hall appoint per&s;ons to e&s;tabli&s;h the value of the ve&s;&s;el and cargo, at the time of her capture and of her arrival in the port into which &s;he is brought, accord|ing to their value in that port. If this &s;hall be agreeable to you, and you will be plea&s;ed to &s;ignify it to me, with the names of the prizes under&s;tood to be of this de&s;|cription, in&s;tructions will be given accordingly, to the collector of the cu&s;toms where the re&s;pective ve&s;&s;els are.</P>
