<P>Sometime in the Month of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t Nine of your Brethren came up to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and they made propo&s;als of Peace in the Name of all the Tribes to Governour <HI>Shirley,</HI> in a Conference had with him. They al&s;o pro|pos'd a Meeting of their Tribes in this Part of the Province, to treat and agree
<PB N="6" REF="006336_0005_1028A33FF4D94C00">
upon the particular Articles or Terms of Peace; declaring they were not then fully authorized for that Purpo&s;e. The Governour promis'd to meet them by him&s;elf, or by his Commi&s;&s;ioners at this Place the 27th of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t. Soon after this, His Excellency's Affairs obliged him to go to <HI>Great-Britain</HI>: And &s;ome Affairs of Con|&s;equence requiring the Pre&s;ence of the Lieutenant-Governour at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> He has appointed Commi&s;&s;ioners with as full Power as He would have had if He had been per&s;onally pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>We have been waiting here fourteen Days: The two Gentlemen from the Go|vernment of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> waited here al&s;o &s;ome Time; but being obliged to return, they have impowered us to act in their Behalf; and have authorized <HI>Roland Cotton,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to Sign in their Name and in behalf of their Government, &s;uch Ar|ticles as we &s;hall agree to.</P>
<P>Sundry Gentlemen of both Governments have been likewi&s;e waiting here &s;ome Time upon this Occa&s;ion, but were obliged to return Home.</P>
<P>The <HI>Norridgowocks</HI> have al&s;o waited as long as we have; but we have defer'd treating with them till the <HI>Penob&s;cots</HI> &s;hould arrive.</P>
<P>We have now taken the fir&s;t Opportunity to confer with you all together.</P>
<P>We have brought the Conference from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t; and hope you have brought what was delivered you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Toxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray hear what I am going to &s;ay.</P>
<P>I have thought of this Matter a great while, and am now come.</P>
<P>It has been foul Weather; I have &s;tay'd till fair Weather.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince Governour <HI>Dummer</HI> treated with us, all the Indians lik'd it well, and have reckon'd it well ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>But yet there has been a dark Cloud for a Time, and a great deal of Blood &s;pilt: But now let us try to cover it over and forget it; and then when that is done, Love will encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>For my Part I am come here for Good. Time has been when your young Men terrified ours and ours have terrify'd yours: But now the Time will come when they may &s;ee one another without Fright.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commi&s;&s;i.</SPEAKER>
<P>We under&s;tand that you are the Chief of the Tribes; and that you are the proper Per&s;on to &s;peak for them; and what you engage they will perform.</P>

<SPEAKER>Toxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am Chief, and they are all of my Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eger Emmet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I went to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> for Peace; and you now &s;ee me for the &s;ame End here.</P>
<P>There were three Indians retarded our coming here in Time, viz. <HI>Loron, Sabou&s;it</HI> and <HI>Wombamando</HI>; who would break up any Thing that is doing for Good. Notwith&s;tanding I am now come to propo&s;e what can be done in Peace; for God is willing that we &s;hould both <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> live in Peace. But <HI>Loron</HI> &s;ays, when there is a <HI>French</HI> War we mu&s;t break again.</P>

<SPEAKER>Commi&s;&s;i.</SPEAKER>
<P>When the Delegates were at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> they gave as one Rea&s;on why they could not finally agree upon a Treaty, becau&s;e their young Men were not pre&s;ent; and they cho&s;e this Place that the young Men might be here.</P>

<P>If a War &s;hould happen between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> are you re&s;olved to keep Peace with us? We don't know of any War, but only de&s;ire to know your Sen|timents.</P>
