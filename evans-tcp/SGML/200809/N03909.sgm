<P>My Lord, I accidentally heard, the <HI>Sunday</HI> Even|ing that they were at my Hou&s;e, that a Per&s;on who had the Appearance of a Gentleman, was hurried in a violent Man|ner over <HI>College Green,</HI> and that a Gentleman who was con|cerned in hurrying the Per&s;on away, an&s;wered the Di&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ip|tion of Capt. <HI>Goodere</HI>; and knowing his Ship was to &s;ail the fir&s;t fair Wind, and remembring that they went out of my Hou&s;e near together, it came directly into my Head, that the Captain had taken him on board, to di&s;tre&s;s him to concede to his Terms, and perhaps might de&s;troy him, when they came on the high Seas. And this Su&s;picion being &s;trengthned by other Circum&s;tances, it made &s;uch a deep Impre&s;&s;ion on my Mind, that I was not ea&s;y all Night; but con&s;idering how long it would be before I could obtain his Maje&s;ty's Writ, <HI>De homine replegiando,</HI> I went the next Morn|ing to Mr Mayor, for a Warrant, and an Officer to go on board the <HI>Ruby</HI> Man of War, to &s;earch her before &s;he was &s;ail'd out of the Liberty of the City; and accordingly his Wor&s;hip &s;ent the Water-Bailiff, with proper A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and full Power and In&s;tructions to &s;earch the Ship for Sir <HI>John Dinely.</HI></P>

<P>It was within a Day or two before we hurried the Decea&s;ed aboard: The Pri&s;oner never owed me Wages, for I never was in the Pri&s;oner's Service. I am a Sailor belon|ging to the <HI>Vernon Schooner,</HI> and an <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI>: He, the Pri|&s;oner, came, and hired me and five others, and gave each of us a Guinea, to do the Bu&s;ine&s;s, which we afterwards did, of hurrying the Decea&s;ed aboard the Pri&s;oner's Ship.</P>

<P>Sunday, Jan. 18, about Seven at Night, the Cap|tain brought his Brother, Sir. <HI>John.</HI> on board, and convey'd him down to the Pur&s;er's Cabin, by Force: When he was down, the Captain ask'd <HI>Whether the Cabin was clear</HI> (for that the <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> before the Murder, the Captain had orde|red me to get the Pur&s;er's Cabin ready for a Gentleman who was coming on board:) I an&s;wer'd, <HI>Yes, Sir</HI>: Then he open|ed the Door, and the People of the Ship forc'd Sir <HI>John</HI> in, he groaning, all the while. When he was in, the Captain call'd for his Steward, and told him to bring a Bottle of Rum and a Gla&s;s: The Captain ask'd Sir <HI>John, How he did?</HI> Sir <HI>John</HI> complain'd of Pains, e&s;pecially in his Thigh: The Captain ask'd him, <HI>If he would drink a Dram?</HI> Sir <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hn</HI> &s;aid, <HI>He had drank nothing but Water the&s;e two Years,</HI> The Cap|tain

then ask'd him, <HI>If he would have any Rum to bathe his Thigh?</HI> Sir <HI>John</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>No:</HI> Then the Captain order'd a Dram for <HI>Mohony</HI> and <HI>Eli&s;ha Cole</HI> (who was the Per&s;on at fir&s;t de&s;ign'd to have done the Murder, but that he was drunk:) After they had a Dram, they all came out of the Cabin. Then <HI>Cole</HI> de&s;ir'd Leave to &s;peak to the Gentleman (Sir <HI>John</HI>) thinking he was the Captain of the Ship he was pre&s;&s;ed out of: <HI>Cole</HI> went in, and told Sir <HI>John, he did his Duty on board the</HI> Charles <HI>as well as another Man,</HI> and &s;wore he would have his Wages: Sir John told him, <HI>He did not know him, nor any thing of the</HI> Charles: On which he again &s;wore, he would have his Wages before he went out of the Ship; for that if he was not the <HI>Captain,</HI> he was the <HI>Owner.</HI> Shortly after <HI>Cole</HI> went out; when the Captain call'd one of the Carpenter's to put <HI>two &s;trong Bolts on the Pur&s;er's Cabin Door</HI>; which was accordingly done. About this Time Sir John ask'd, If he could &s;peak with any one of the Officers on board: The Carpenter made An&s;wer, <HI>I am the Carpenter</HI>: Sir <HI>John</HI> ask'd if he could &s;peak a Word with him? He reply'd, <HI>a Hundred if he plea&s;ed.</HI> Then the Carpenter ope|ning the Door, in order to clench the Staples, Sir <HI>John</HI> ask'd him, <HI>What his Brother</HI> Sam. <HI>was going to do with him? What, is he going to murder me?</HI> The Carpenter reply'd <HI>No, He is willing to have your Company, Sir; he does it for your Good:</HI> Sir <HI>John</HI> &s;aid, <HI>But what will become of all my Servants and E&s;tate all this Time?</HI> On this the Carpenter retir'd: And pre&s;ently after the Captain came down again, and order'd the Doctor's fir&s;t Mate to go to <HI>feel his Pul&s;e,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>We mu&s;t patch him up as well as we can, he is a crazy old Man: Go, in,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and feel his Pul&s;e</HI>: Accordingly the Docter went in, and when he came to Sir <HI>John,</HI> he asked him, Where his Pains were? He an&s;wer'd, <HI>He lately came from</HI> Bath, <HI>and had a Pain in his Head;</HI> and complain'd of many other Pains, occa&s;ion'd by the rough U&s;age in bringing him on board.

he was going to he murder'd; and hop'd it would be brought to Light, for that it was impo&s;&s;ible it could be done without &s;ome|body hearing or &s;eeing it.</HI> About Nine at Night I h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> him knocking and calling out <HI>Ho! Ho! Brother Sailors I have almo&s;t forgot my Sea Terms, let me have a Bucket to Pi&s;s in, and ea&s;e my&s;elf, for it will be a Shame to do it in the Cabin.</HI> Upon this I look'd out at the Cabin Door, and call'd out to the Centry to get &s;omething for the Gentleman to ea&s;e him&s;elf in: And pre&s;ently afterwards <HI>Mahony</HI> came with a Bucket; when Sir <HI>John</HI> told him of his Exploits, and that he had been Captain of an <HI>India Man,</HI> &amp;c. About Two or Three in the Morning my Wife waked me: And I heard a va&s;t Struggling at fir&s;t, and the old Gentleman to cry, <HI>Twenty Guineas! Take it! Take it! Mu&s;t I die!

Then a Candle was handed into the Cabin: And I &s;aw, thro' the Crevace of the Partition, <HI>Mahony</HI> holding the Candle in his Hand, and <HI>White</HI> plunder'd his Pockets, turning his Body in order to come at it, and took out of his Pocket his Watch and Money.

In about a Minute after, I &s;aw a <HI>white Hand</HI> on the Throat of the Decea&s;ed, which I took to be the Captain's Pre&s;ently they all went out of the Cabin, and left the Decea&s;ed alone Then I went to the Doctor's Mate and the Centry; and, by their Opinion, they took: the Gentleman to be dead: Then I went to the Lieu|tenant and told him what I had <HI>heard</HI> and <HI>&s;een,</HI> and that <HI>Mahony</HI> and <HI>White</HI> had murdered the Gentleman, and that I believed the Captain was concern'd. The Lieutenant was very dubious of the Truth at fir&s;t, telling me, he did not

think the Captain would be guilty of any &s;uch Thing; but, on my giving him &s;uch plain Demon&s;trations of the Thing, he began to think there was &s;omething in it.

About Nine or Ten in the Morning, the Lieutenant and Gunner contrived a Method, that I &s;hould go in and complain I had lo&s;t &s;ix Guineas out of my Che&s;t: Accord|ingly going with this Complaint, I &s;eiz'd the Captain as he was walking with his Hands behind him: And the re&s;t who were at Hand ru&s;h'd in after me.

Then the Captain ask'd me, <HI>If his Brother made any Noi&s;e?</HI> On which I told him, that he made a little Moan for the Time that I was there.

<P>Sir <HI>John</HI> made a little Moan: And the Captain &s;aid to me, <HI>Centry, give me the Sword, and you go upon Deck, becau&s;e I want to talk to my Brother privately by him&s;elf:</HI> Accordingly I gave him the Sword, and went up into the Gun Room, and there walk'd: A little after, down came <HI>Mahony,</HI> and the Centry ask'd where he was going?

<P>Another Gentleman was call'd by Mr. <HI>Goodere,</HI> to his Character; but being ask'd whether he knew Sir <HI>John</HI> to be any Ways mad, or the like?
