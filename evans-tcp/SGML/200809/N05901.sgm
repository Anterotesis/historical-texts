<P>THAT part of God's holy word, upon which my Di&s;cour&s;e at this time will be grounded, is in the XVth Chapter of the Revelation of St. <HI>John,</HI> the 3d and 4th Ver&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>&mdash;GREAT and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; ju&s;t and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints! WHO &s;hall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name! for thou only art holy: For all nations &s;hall come and wor&s;hip before thee; for thy judgments are made manife&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THE uncommon and alarming occurrences of divine providence, which we have experi|enced in the late EARTHQUAKES, &s;eem to demand a very particular and uncommon notice. And altho' I have not, till now, invited you into the hou&s;e of God, for that purpo&s;e; yet you, <HI>My Brethren</HI> of this &s;ociety, are my witne&s;&s;es, that I have not let the&s;e providential vi&s;itations pa&s;s wholly

unregarded hitherto; but, more than once, taken oc|ca&s;ion to &s;peak of them; and improved them as an argument to inforce that practical religion and holine&s;s of life, which is doubtle&s;s the moral end and de&s;ign of them. So that many things which might have properly been &s;aid upon the occa&s;ion, have already been &s;aid in this place: Which mu&s;t be my apology with tho&s;e who may not hear, in this di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ome things which they might, perhaps, expect in it. For I am not fond of repetitions, e&s;pecially upon a &s;ubject which &s;ugge&s;ts &s;uch a great variety of reflections, as renders it quite needle&s;s to u&s;e any; and in di&s;cour|&s;ing upon which, it is, indeed, much more difficult to contract and &s;uppre&s;s, than it is to enlarge.</P>
<P>AND now we are a&s;&s;embled together, out of the common, &s;tated cour&s;e, to contemplate, and religi|ou&s;ly to improve, the&s;e mighty and wonderful works of God, I know of no pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, fitter for the ba&s;is of a di&s;cour&s;e upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, than that which was ju&s;t now read to you. This will na|turally lead us from particular in&s;tances and manife&s;|tations of God's power, to a more enlarged contem|plation of his mighty deeds; and the glory and ma|je&s;ty of that kingdom, which "ruleth over all."</P>
<P>THERE is &s;uch an elevation and dignity, &s;uch a di|vine energy and pathos, in this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, as can hardly fail to rai&s;e and fix the attention of every one. However, if any thing farther &s;hould be nece&s;|&s;ary to this end, it will be found in the great occa&s;ion upon which, the glorious place where, and the
<PB N="7" REF="007486_0006_102B9E2E6F125E88">
ble&s;&s;ed Ones by whom, the words are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been originally uttered. I &s;hall, therefore, ju&s;t re|mind you of the&s;e things, before I proceed to a parti|cular con&s;ideration of the pa&s;&s;age it&s;elf.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>John</HI> the Divine, being in the Spirit, and rapt in the vi&s;ions of God into future times, had a repre|&s;entation made to him of the woes and plagues, and the final de&s;truction, which were to come upon tho&s;e of the grand apo&s;tacy from the pure faith and wor&s;hip of the Go&s;pel; upon that antichri&s;tian power which is emblematically de&s;cribed by <Q>a woman arayed in purple, and &s;carlet colour, and decked with gold, and precious &s;tones and pearls;</Q>&mdash;and having <Q>upon her forehead a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. 17. 4, 5.</NOTE></Q> The plagues which St. <HI>John</HI> in his vi&s;ion, or rather vi&s;ions, &s;aw coming upon great Babylon, (whatever is intended hereby) were &s;ucce&s;&s;ive; and ari&s;ing one above ano|ther in greatne&s;s and terror, till at length <Q>there were voices, and thunders and lightnings,</Q> as he expre&s;&s;es it; and <Q>a great Earthquake, &s;uch a one as was not &s;ince men were upon the earth, &s;o mighty an Earthquake and &s;o great. And the great city was divided into three parts; and the cities of the nations fell;</Q> [i. e. of the nations which had "drank of the wine of the wrath of her fornication," chap. XIV. ver. 8.] <Q>and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fiercene&s;s of his wrath.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chap. XVI. ver. 18, 19.</NOTE></Q>
<PB N="8" REF="007486_0007_102B9E319AB21B40">
It &s;eems to have been at this dividing of the great city into three parts by an Earthquake, attended, or immediately followed by a mighty fire; and not at her final overthrow, that St. <HI>John</HI> &s;aw the <Q>kings of the earth who had committed fornication with her;</Q> the "merchants who were made rich by her;" and "every &s;hip-ma&s;ter, and all the company in &s;hips,"&mdash;<Q>&s;tanding afar off, for fear of her torment, weeping and wailing, and &s;aying, Alas! alas! that great city</Q>&mdash;for in one hour &s;o great riches is come to "nought"!&mdash;and <Q>crying when they &s;aw the &s;moke of her burning, &s;aying, What city is like unto this great city! And they ca&s;t du&s;t upon their heads, weeping and wailing, and &s;aying, Alas! alas! that great city, wherein were made rich all that had &s;hips in the &s;ea&mdash;Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apo&s;tles and prophets; for God hath aven|ged you on her!<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chap. XVIII. ver 3, 15&mdash;20.</NOTE></Q> I &s;ay, it &s;eems not to be her final de&s;truction, at which the&s;e lamentations of &s;ome, and exultations of others, are made; that being to be effected by another, and &s;till greater earthquake. And this her utter ruin was accordingly repre&s;ented to St. <HI>John</HI> immediately after, by the following expre&s;&s;ive emblem. "And a mighty angel," &s;ays he, <Q>took a &s;tone like a great mill-&s;tone, and ca&s;t it into the &s;ea, &s;aying, THUS, with violence, &s;hall that great city Ba|bylon be thrown down, and &s;hall be FOUND NO MORE AT ALL. And the voice of harpers and mu&s;icians, and of pipers, and of trumpeters, &s;hall
<PB N="9" REF="007486_0008_102B9E3459C828A0">
be heard no more at all in thee&mdash;and the light of a candle &s;hall &s;hine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride &s;hall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy mer|chants were the great men of the earth; for by thy &s;orceries were all nations deceived.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ver. 21, 22, 23.</NOTE></Q> This is plainly her final overthrow and de&s;truction. But who, or what is meant by <HI>Babylon</HI> the great, the wo|man arayed in purple and &s;carlet, and &s;tyled the mo|ther of harlots and abominations of the earth; who or what, I &s;ay, is intended hereby, I &s;hall leave every one to conjecture; only ju&s;t ob&s;erving, that St. <HI>John</HI> tells us, &s;he &s;itteth on "&s;even hills;" that &s;he <Q>reign|eth over the kings of the earth;</Q> and that <Q>in her was found the blood of prophets, and of &s;aints, and of all that were &s;lain upon the earth.</Q></P>
<P>Now it is to be ob&s;erved, that when St. <HI>John</HI> &s;aw the "&s;even angels having the &s;even la&s;t plagues<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chap. XV. ver. 1.</NOTE>" to pour out upon the earth, and particularly upon Ba|bylon, he had al&s;o a vi&s;ion of that glorious region where tho&s;e were, <Q>that had gotten the victory over the bea&s;t, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name&mdash;having the harps of GOD.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ver. 2.</NOTE></Q> And tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed and happy per&s;ons it was, that he heard <Q>&s;inging this &s;ong of MOSES the &s;ervant of GOD, and the &s;ong of the LAMB, &s;aying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord GOD Almighty!</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="007486_0009_102B9E35DF549588">
This is the anthem of the ble&s;&s;ed, in tho&s;e glori|ous man&s;ions, with reference to the great events of which St. <HI>John</HI> &s;peaks; while they anticipate the final overthrow of that power which <Q>exalts it&s;elf above all that is called God, and that is wor&s;hipped.</Q> And the&s;e circum&s;tances being taken into con&s;idera|tion, they cannot but give an additional &s;olemnity and dignity to this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, in which there is &s;uch a native &s;ublimity and grandeur, as cannot but &s;trike, warm, and elevate the minds of all, except the gro&s;ly abandoned, or naturally-&s;tupid.</P>
<P>To imagine that we, poor &s;ojourners on earth, and inhabitants of clay, can, with a proper ardor, and an equally elevated devotion, bear a part in this &s;ong of prai&s;e and triumph, were, indeed, great vanity and pre|&s;umption: But yet, not &s;o much as to li&s;ten to it, and try to join the chorus, were certainly unbecoming our profe&s;&s;ion and character as chri&s;tians: For by becom|ing truly &s;uch, we claim a kindred with the ble&s;&s;ed above; and are, in a &s;ort, of one &s;ociety with them; being the adopted children of Him, of whom the <Q>whole family in heaven and earth is named.</Q> In the &s;trong and emphatical language of &s;cripture, we are not only <Q>fellow-citizens with the &s;aints, and of the hou&s;hold of God,</Q> here on earth; but we are <Q>come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jeru&s;alem:</Q>&mdash;<Q>and to the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born which are written in heaven;</Q> and not only <Q>to the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made per|fect,</Q>
<PB N="11" REF="007486_0010_102B9E37F16EF3F8">
but <Q>to an innumerable company of angels;</Q> and not only to an innumerable com|pany of angels, but <Q>to Je&s;us the Mediator of the new covenant;</Q> and not only to Je&s;us the Media|tor of the new covenant, but <Q>to God the Judge of all.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 22, 23, 24.</NOTE></Q> If we are truly the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, we are now united by faith, by love, temper and affec|tion, not only with &s;aints, angels, and arch-angels above, but with our glorified Redeemer; and God him&s;elf dwelleth in us, and we in God<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. 4, 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LET us, therefore, bearing in mind the honourable kindred, and glorious relation, which we boa&s;t to the inhabitants of Sion that is above, <Q>draw near with a true heart, in full a&s;&s;urance of faith;</Q> even as <Q>&s;eeing him who is invi&s;ible;</Q> and in his immutable vera|city beholding and anticipating the great events re|pre&s;ented in the&s;e vi&s;ions of St. <HI>John;</HI> Let us, I &s;ay, now draw near in full a&s;&s;urance of faith, &s;aying, <Q>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God almighty! ju&s;t and true are thy ways, thou King of &s;aints! Who &s;hall not fear thee, and glorify thy name! for thou only art holy: For all nations &s;hall come and wor&s;hip before thee; for thy judg|ments are made manife&s;t!</Q></P>
<P>HOWEVER, it is not my de&s;ign at pre&s;ent, to con|&s;ider the&s;e words with a particular view to the origi|nal de&s;ign of them, as they are found in the vi&s;ions of St. <HI>John:</HI> Had this been my intention, I &s;hould have been more exact and critical in pointing out to
<PB N="12" REF="007486_0011_102B9E39B69F5E30">
you the order and &s;eries, and the di&s;tinct parts of the&s;e vi&s;ions; which is now needle&s;s: Becau&s;e I in|tend to con&s;ider the pa&s;&s;age as if it were independent, having no connection with any thing preceeding or following. And being taken in this light, it will, I &s;uppo&s;e, naturally enough lead us to &s;uch contem|plations upon God, his works and attributes; and to &s;uch practical reflections as will perfectly coincide with the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and our de&s;ign in coming to wor&s;hip and bow down before the Lord our Maker at this time. For it naturally leads us, in the</P>
<P>FIRST place, to con&s;ider the greatne&s;s of God's works; which proclaim his omnipotence. And</P>
<P>SECONDLY, their wonderfulne&s;s, and in&s;cruta|bility.&mdash;Which two particulars are obviou&s;ly &s;ug|ge&s;ted by the former part of the pa&s;&s;age: <Q><HI>Great</HI> and <HI>marvellous</HI> are thy works, Lord God <HI>Almighty!</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIRDLY, the moral perfections of God, in the exerci&s;e of which he governs the univer&s;e&mdash;<Q><HI>Ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>true</HI> are thy ways, thou <HI>King of Saints</HI>&mdash;thou only art <HI>holy</HI>&mdash;thy <HI>judgments</HI> are made ma|nife&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>FOURTHLY, The obligations lying upon all men to fear, glorify, and wor&s;hip him&mdash;<Q>Who &s;hall not <HI>fear</HI> thee, O Lord, and <HI>glorify</HI> thy name&mdash;all nations &s;hall come and <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> before thee.</Q></P>
<P>And,</P>
<P>LASTLY, It will lead us to &s;ome practical re|flections upon tho&s;e great and marvellous works of
<PB N="13" REF="007486_0012_102B9E3BB6F06078">
God, to make a religious improvement of which, we are now a&s;&s;embled together.</P>
<P>I SHALL be the &s;horter in the &s;peculative, doctri|nal part of my di&s;cour&s;e, that I may have the more time for what I imagine will be more u&s;eful; I mean, the practical. And as I would hope there are none pre&s;ent, but what are pre&s;ent with a good in|tention, I &s;hould be &s;orry if any of my hearers &s;hould go away without being the better for what they hear. Accordingly, tho' I will endeavour to remember that men have heads, as well as hearts and con&s;ciences; yet I &s;hall aim rather at &s;peaking to the latter, than to the former.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I. Of the Greatne&s;s of God's Works.</HEAD>
<P>LET us then, in the fir&s;t place, con&s;ider the great|ne&s;s of God's works; which proclaim his om|nipotence. <Q><HI>Great</HI>&mdash;are thy works, Lord God <HI>Al|mighty!</HI></Q>&mdash;It is to be ob&s;erved, that there are no powers in what we commonly call natural, &s;econdary cau&s;es, but what are, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, originally de|rived from the fir&s;t; and no real agency in any that are wholly material. Activity or agency, properly &s;peaking, belongs only to mind or &s;pirit; and all tho&s;e powers and operations which in common lan|guage are a&s;cribed to natural bodies, are really ef|fects and operations of the &s;upreme, original cau&s;e.
<PB N="14" REF="007486_0013_102B9E3E461524E8">
So that all the works which we behold, are, &s;trictly &s;peaking, God's works; excepting tho&s;e which are wrought by men, and other finite, intelligent beings. And even the&s;e latter are, in one &s;en&s;e, God's works; becau&s;e, though human agency, and the agency of other &s;ubordinate intelligences, is not to be wholly excluded and &s;et a&s;ide; yet the active powers of the&s;e beings are both derived from, and upheld by Him, to whom "power" emphatically "belongeth"<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxii. 11.</NOTE>: And al&s;o becau&s;e all the&s;e &s;ubordinate agents, in all their operations, are under the controul and dominion of the Almighty; and employed by Him to fulfil his purpo&s;es and plea&s;ure. So that all the works which we behold are, in a large &s;en&s;e, and in the lan|guage of &s;cripture, the doings and works of God. And accordingly the works of God, in the &s;cripture phra&s;eology, comprehend tho&s;e of creation, of nature and providence; and whatever God does as the Lord and Governor of the world, who&s;e kingdom ruleth over all.</P>
<P>AND now, how manifold, and how great are the&s;e works! Whether we turn our eyes to the great and wide &s;ea, or to the dry land; to the earth beneath us, or to the heavens above us, &s;till we behold the mighty works of God. The ocean, which is &s;hut up within limits which it cannot tran&s;gre&s;s, but when God gives it a di&s;pen&s;ation for &s;o doing; and wherein are things "innumerable both &s;mall and great bea&s;ts;" this is, &s;urely, a great and a&s;toni&s;hing work. And how mighty
<PB N="15" REF="007486_0014_102B9E40A380CA78">
and powerful is that Being who made, and who has fixed bounds to it, &s;aying, <Q>Hitherto &s;halt thou come, and no farther; and here &s;hall thy proud waves be &s;tayed?</Q> that Being, who holds the waters of it in the "hollow of his hand;" and whom its winds and &s;urges obey? that Being, upon whom all its nu|merous inhabitants wait, that he may <Q>give them their meat in due &s;ea&s;on;</Q> which are troubled when he only "hideth his face," and die when he "taketh their breath?"</P>
<P>THE dry land is not le&s;s full of his great works and wonders. Con&s;ider the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;ts, and the cattle upon a thou&s;and hills: Con&s;ider the huge, bulky animals, and the places where they range; the wide extended plains, and the "everla&s;ting moun|tains" with their &s;ummits above the clouds; the mighty volcanos in different parts of the world, whence rivers of liquid fire flow for miles into the ocean, like tho&s;e of water from other mountains, as though they were going to contend for that place which God "founded" for the other element: Con&s;ider the concu&s;&s;ion of an Earthquake, when half a continent with its neighbouring i&s;lands, and their &s;urrounding &s;eas, are at once &s;haken; as though the land and wa|ter which God once &s;eparated, were again to be mixed and confounded together: Con&s;ider the&s;e works of God, I &s;ay, and tell me if they are not great!</P>
<P>CONSIDER next, the air and atmo&s;phere with which the whole earth is &s;urrounded, and in which it is in|folded
<PB N="16" REF="007486_0015_102B9E4349A5C5B8">

AND if the&s;e works of God, which have now been hinted at, are great, and proclaim an all-powerful Being; what do tho&s;e innumerable worlds do, which we behold revolving about us in &s;uch an admirable order!

<P>GOD's works of judgment, which have been abroad, and made manife&s;t in the earth, from one generati|on to another, may ju&s;tly be termed great. Was not that, one &s;uch work, for example, when God rained fire and brim&s;tone out of heaven, and con&s;umed tho&s;e wicked cities, Sodom and Gomorrha; and when the ground on which they &s;tood, was &s;unk, doubtle&s;s by an earthquake, to a &s;tanding nau&s;eous pool, as at this day? Was not that another &s;uch work, when he &s;ent his Angel, and by him, de&s;troyed in one night, &s;uch a va&s;t multitude in the A&s;&s;yrian camp?

But how great, more e&s;pecially, was that work of God, when the fountains of the great deep were broken up? when the waters aro&s;e above the tops of the talle&s;t mountains, and the flood of his anger came <Q>upon the world of the ungodly, and &s;wept them all away!</Q></P>
<P>BUT God's works of goodne&s;s and kindne&s;s are not le&s;s great and illu&s;trious, from age to age, than tho&s;e of his ju&s;t &s;everity.

<P>THERE is, indeed, &s;uch a thing as natural philo&s;o|phy, which is of great u&s;e both to the purpo&s;es of life

and godline&s;s; and which, therefore, well de&s;erves to be cultivated. However, the whole of what goes by that name, &s;eems to be no more than the ob&s;erv|ing of facts, their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and order; and reducing them to a general analogy; to certain e&s;tabli&s;hed rules, and a &s;ettled cour&s;e and &s;eries of events; cal|led the laws of nature, from their &s;teadine&s;s and con|&s;tancy. This, I &s;ay, &s;eems to comprehend the whole of what we u&s;ually call natural philo&s;ophy. But af|ter all the improvements that have been made here|in, how many things are there in the natural world, which never have been, and perhaps never will be, reduced to any &s;uch general analogy, or to the com|mon known laws of nature? How many phaenomi|na are there, which we may call the <HI>irregulars,</HI> the <HI>anomalies,</HI> and <HI>heteroclites</HI> in the grammar, in the great book and language of nature, by which God &s;peaks to us as really, as by his written oracles? Were the laws of comets, of inundations, of earthquakes, of meteors, of tempe&s;ts, of the aurora borealies, of mon|&s;trous births? were the particular laws and cau&s;es of the&s;e, and of a thou&s;and other phaenomena, I &s;ay, ever plainly di&s;covered? I mean, &s;o that they could be methodically calculated, foretold, and account|ed for, as we calculate, foretel and account for com|mon tides, eclip&s;es, &amp;c? No, &s;urely; this has never been done by the greate&s;t philo&s;ophers, with any toler|able degree of certainty and preci&s;ion; tho' there have been very ingenious, and even probable hypothe&s;is con|cerning &s;ome of the&s;e phaenomena. However, their
<PB N="26" REF="007486_0025_102B9E5969FE07D0">
cau&s;es and laws &s;till remain very much in the dark: which may be owing, in part, to our not having cri|tically ob&s;erved a &s;ufficient number of facts in each kind, from whence to draw general conclu&s;ions, and on which to form theories. For there is doubtle&s;s as regular an order and connexion of the&s;e facts and effects, in nature, whether actually &s;een and known by us or not; and therefore as truly a cour&s;e of nature with re&s;pect to them, as there is of, and with re&s;pect to, the mo&s;t common and familiar. But this connex|ion and order is, as yet, too recondite and hidden for human penetration; &s;o that we can do but little more than form conjectures about the&s;e things. The&s;e works of God may, therefore, ju&s;tly be called mar|vellous, pa&s;t finding out; and the&s;e wonders of nature are al&s;o without number.</P>
<P>BUT upon &s;uppo&s;ition that all tho&s;e works of God, which we call the works of nature, could be brought to a common analogy, and methodicaly arranged un|der certain known laws, as &s;ome of them are, &s;o as to admit of a &s;olution as plainly, and in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, that eclip&s;es, common tides, or any other natural phaenomena do; even upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, I &s;ay, our knowledge would &s;till be very imperfect; and the works of God, &s;till marvellous to us. For it is to be remembered, that the&s;e general laws, by which we think to account for all other things, are them|&s;elves my&s;terious and inexplicable. Who, for exam|ple, can, without vanity and pre&s;umption, pretend to under&s;tand the great law of gravitation; the mo&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="007486_0026_102B9E5B640822E8">
general and exten&s;ive one, which we know of in na|ture? Who, I &s;ay, can, without the utmo&s;t vanity and pre&s;umption pretend to a thorough under&s;tanding of this law? e&s;pecially after a NEWTON has confe&s;&s;ed his ignorance of it; and expre&s;&s;ed his doubts, whe|ther it were the effect of God's immediate power, operating regularly upon every particle of matter throughout the univer&s;e; or whether it were the ef|fect of &s;ome intermediate, natural cau&s;e, unknown to us? &s;ome &s;ubtle medium pervading all natural bo|dies and &s;ub&s;tances? And though the latter were known to be the ca&s;e, &s;till the &s;ame, or rather a greater difficulty would recur, re&s;pecting that prior, and higher natural cau&s;e; and &s;o on <HI>in infinitum;</HI> or, at lea&s;t, 'till we come to that great Fir&s;t Cau&s;e and Agent, who is the "lea&s;t under&s;tood" of all things. For He mu&s;t needs be more incomprehen&s;ible even than any of his marvellous works, &s;ince our fir&s;t knowledge of Him, is learnt from them.</P>
<P>WHAT is &s;aid above concerning the law of gravi|tation, is equally applicable to all others, which we call natural cau&s;es, or laws of nature: They are all really incomprehen&s;ible. We can no more penetrate into the true rea&s;on why a &s;park of fire, rather than a drop of water, &s;hould cau&s;e an explo&s;ion when dropped on powder; than we can tell why a &s;tone, left to it&s;elf in the air, &s;hould fall, rather than a&s;cend: i. e. we cannot do it at all. Thus it is as to all natural cau&s;es in general. So that, as was inti|mated
<PB N="28" REF="007486_0027_102B9E5D85EDE608">
above, our knowledge would be very imperfect, even though we could ea&s;ily reduce all the phaeno|mena in the natural world, to known, general laws; as it is certain we cannot. We &s;hould then know nothing but facts and effects, their regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and order. For though we &s;peak of the natural, vi|&s;ible cau&s;es of many things; yet the&s;e cau&s;es &s;eem to be plainly effects them&s;elves; and the <HI>real</HI> cau&s;e of them, and of all things, is hidden, quite veiled from mortal &s;ight; <Q>though He be not far from every one of us.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 27.</NOTE></Q> <Q>Behold, we go forward, but He is not [vi&s;ibly] there; and backward, but we cannot perceive Him: One the left hand, where He doth work, but we cannot behold Him: He hideth Him&s;elf on the right hand, that we cannot &s;ee Him. But He knoweth the way that we take!<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Job xxiii. 8, 9, 10.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>THAT cau&s;e which acts thus regularly, mightily, and marvellou&s;ly, every-where; mu&s;t needs be all-wi&s;e, all-powerful, and omnipre&s;ent: And into His incomprehen&s;ible agency, non-plu&s;s'd philo&s;ophy it|&s;elf mu&s;t ultimately re&s;olve all natural effects, toge|ther with their apparent, vi&s;ible cau&s;es.</P>
<P>So that the whole natural world, is really nothing but one great wonder and my&s;tery. It is not only tho&s;e which we, in common language, call the great works of God, that are marvellous and in&s;crutable; but the lea&s;t of them al&s;o.

<HEAD>PART III. Of the moral Perfections and Govern|ment of God.</HEAD>
<P>BUT though human wi&s;dom cannot &s;can or comprehend the great and marvellous works of God; yet we do, or may know &s;o much, both of Him and them, as may &s;erve the ends of practical re|ligion; which is the end of man.&mdash;So that though we &s;hould guard again&s;t vanity on one hand, yet we &s;hould equally guard again&s;t fal&s;e mode&s;ty, or &s;cep|tici&s;m on the other. We are not &s;hut up in a va&s;t, dark labyrinth, without any crevice or clue at all.

given us, it will lead us out of this darkne&s;s into o|pen and endle&s;s day. But not to dwell upon meta|phor, and allu&s;ion: God gives us &s;uch notices of him|&s;elf by his works, by the cour&s;e of his providence, by our rea&s;on, and by his word, that though we mu&s;t confe&s;s our ignorance of innumerable things, &s;till we may &s;ay with confidence&mdash;<Q>Ju&s;t and true are thy ways, thou King of &s;aints!</Q>&mdash;<Q>Thou only art holy!</Q>&mdash;"Thy judgments are made manife&s;t!"</P>
<P>AMIDST all our darkne&s;s and ignorance, we &s;ee enough, unle&s;s we are wilfully blind, to convince us, That God is a moral Governor; or that a moral go|vernment is actually e&s;tabli&s;hed, and gradually car|rying on in the world; and that we our&s;elves are the &s;ubjects of it. Had we only the light of nature to direct us, we might by properly following it, conclude with a good degree of certainty. That God is a be|neficent, true, and righteous being; the patron of good men, and the enemy of the wicked; and one who will, &s;ooner or later, give to every man accord|ing to his deeds. For is not the Creator, and Uphol|der, al&s;o the Lord and Judge, of all?

found in one of the books of revelation, yet the pa&s;|&s;age is really the language of nature: Nor, indeed, do I remember that any have &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>Elihu</HI> who utters them, was in&s;pired. The&s;e are the &s;enti|ments which naturally ari&s;e in an improved, virtuous mind, upon contemplating the works of God; the great, independent Being, and &s;ource of all things.</P>
<P>THE moral perfections which we u&s;ually a&s;cribe to God, &s;eem to have a connexion with tho&s;e natural ones, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily belong to the original cau&s;e of all things; particularly with independency, or &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, infinite wi&s;dom, and unbounded power. It is &s;carce, if at all po&s;&s;ible, to conceive of that Being who has the&s;e natural perfections, to be fal&s;e, cruel, or unju&s;t; or to be otherwi&s;e than faith|ful and true, holy and righteous. So that the&s;e latter attributes are, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, deducible from the for|mer. But this argument, u&s;ually called by metaphy|&s;icians, the argument <HI>a priori;</HI> this argument, I &s;ay, in conjunction with &s;ome others, will appear conclu|&s;ive to every thoughtful and hone&s;t man: I mean, particularly, tho&s;e arguments which may be drawn from the moral nature which God has given us; from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s we have of right and wrong; from the law written in our hearts; from our immediate &s;en&s;e of good and of ill de&s;ert; and from the ve&s;ti|ges and traces of goodne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, which we plainly &s;ee in the con&s;titution, and in the cour&s;e of nature; and the di&s;pen&s;ations of God's provi|dence

towards men. For although the judgments<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">By the <HI>judgments</HI> of God, if I mi&s;take not, people generally, indeed almo&s;t always, intend the manife&s;tations of God's di&s;|plea&s;ure in the afflictive di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence. But in the language of &s;cripture, by that phra&s;e is often meant the &s;tatutes, ordinances and commandments of God; but more ge|nerally, I think, the <HI>judicial acts</HI> of God in the cour&s;e of his providence, as he is the moral Governor of the world, in &s;uch a large &s;en&s;e as equally to comprehend the kind and fa|vourable di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, with tho&s;e of his righ|teous &s;everity; though &s;ometimes with a more particular reference to one of them, than to the other. In the pa&s;&s;age now under con&s;ideration, it &s;eems to be u&s;ed in this large, com|prehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e; tho&s;e judgments of God which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be "made manife&s;t", being not only acts and in&s;tances of his vindictive ju&s;tice again&s;t Babylon; but al&s;o manife&s;tations of his truth, goodne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s to the upright, as he is the "King of &s;aints." Sometimes the phra&s;e ought to be under&s;tood in a &s;till more exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e; &s;o as to include the laws of God, and the execution of them, both in reward|ing the good, and in puni&s;hing the wicked: i. e. it compre|hends whatever God does, con&s;idered in the character of the moral governor, the lawgiver, and the judge of the world. In this mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e, God's judgments are often &s;aid to be "right," to be "righteous," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> of God are not now made manife&s;t in &s;o great a degree as they will be at that period, to which the pa&s;&s;age my di&s;cour&s;e is grounded upon, relates; yet they are di&s;coverable in &s;ome degree at pre&s;ent, by what we daily &s;ee and experience. Although there may be room left for men of perver&s;e and corrupt minds to cavil again&s;t, there is really none for men of fair, in|genuous minds to doubt of, much le&s;s to deny, the morality of the government we are now under, the things which have been ju&s;t hinted at above, and for a particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which, there is not time, be|ing duly con&s;idered.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="007486_0035_102B9E6EDE014258">
HOWEVER, I mu&s;t ju&s;t ob&s;erve, That as the light of nature &s;hows the world to be under a moral go|vernment and Governor, faithful, good, and righte|ous; &s;o revelation, not only &s;ometimes a&s;&s;erts this, but always &s;uppo&s;es, and takes it for granted, as the foundation and ground-work of all; as the ba&s;is on which the whole fabrick &s;tands. The whole &s;cheme of our redemption by Chri&s;t, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, in all its parts, is grounded upon this &s;uppo&s;ition. For certainly the chri&s;tian revelation pre&s;uppo&s;es man|kind to be antecedently under the righteous govern|ment of God, and accountable to him for their acti|ons; &s;ince it propo&s;es a method for our e&s;caping the puni&s;hment due to the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of His laws. It &s;uppo&s;es God to be good and merciful; &s;ince this very method of &s;alvation for &s;inners, could originate in nothing but goodne&s;s and mercy&mdash;[<Q>God &s;o lov|ed the world, that he gave his only begotton Son,</Q> &amp;c.&mdash;] It either a&s;&s;erts, or takes it for granted, that God does, in the cour&s;e of his providence, even in all ages, reward and puni&s;h here, in &s;ome degree, the good and the wicked re&s;pectively, both individuals and whole communities. But the chri&s;tian revelation is more e&s;pecially a confirmation of the morality of God's government, as it &s;o expre&s;ly teaches us, That there is a time of retribution approaching, wherein the righ|teous &s;hall receive a glorious recompence of reward; and the wicked, the puni&s;hment which their &s;ins de|&s;erve, though delayed for a &s;ea&s;on; and all men in

general, receive the things done in the body, whether good or bad. This will be the completion and per|fection of that moral &s;cheme and plan, which is al|ready e&s;tabli&s;hed; which is carrying into execution from age to age; and which is plainly di&s;cernable to tho&s;e who are not loth to &s;ee and acknowledge it; di&s;cernable, even from our own frame and con&s;tituti|on, and from every day's experience. For we find a law of righteou&s;ne&s;s written on our hearts, though we may try to expunge and di&s;annul it, by rea&s;on of the law of &s;in that is in our members, and which wars again&s;t it. We find our&s;elves intru&s;ted in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, by the Author of our being, with our own happine&s;s; we find that virtue is the road to felicity; and vice, to mi&s;ery here. Nor is there the lea&s;t pre&s;umption in rea&s;on, again&s;t the general doctrine of revelation, That our good and bad deeds, or at lea&s;t the effects of them, &s;hall follow us into another &s;tate, where this moral &s;cheme &s;hall appear in its perfection, both in the goodne&s;s, and in the righteous &s;everity of God. For there may be certain grand periods in the mo|ral, as well as in the natural world; both a &s;eed-time, and a time of harve&s;t; in the latter of which, he that has before <Q>&s;owed to the fle&s;h, &s;hall of the fle&s;h reap corruption;</Q> and he that hath <Q>&s;owed to the &s;pirit, &s;hall of the &s;pirit reap everla&s;ting life.</Q> And you know who has &s;aid in this allegorical way,&mdash;"The harve&s;t is the end of the world," &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>PART IV. Of our Obligation to fear, glorify and wor&s;hip God.</HEAD>
<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture leads us, in the next place, to con&s;ider the obligation which we are under to fear, glorify and wor&s;hip God; which ob|ligation re&s;ults from his perfections, and the relation in which he &s;tands towards us&mdash;<Q>Who &s;hall not <HI>fear</HI> thee, O Lord, and <HI>glorify</HI> thy name?&mdash;All nations &s;hall come and <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> before thee.</Q> And who can doubt his obligation to do thus, if God is &s;uch a Being as he has been imperfectly repre&s;ented to be, in the foregoing parts of this di&s;cour&s;e? if he is in|deed the "Lord God almighty"? if his works are thus "great and marvellous"? if he is the "King of Saints"? if his ways are all "ju&s;t and true" if he "only is holy"? if his "judgments" are, and will be, thus "made manife&s;t"? What man? what nation, &s;hall not fear, adore and wor&s;hip a Being, &s;o gloriou&s;ly great, powerful, ju&s;t and good!</P>
<P>THERE is One, and but One, to be feared: And certainly you can be in no doubt. Who that One is. There is a harmony and uniformity of de&s;ign vi&s;ible in the works of nature and providence, which &s;hows that all originally proceeds from, and is governed by ONE: Which dictate of nature, or rea&s;on, is abun|dantly ratified and confirmed by revelation. For it is as clearly and expre&s;ly declared, That there is but
<PB N="39" REF="007486_0038_102B9E759E48AF80">
"One God," as it is, that there is but <Q>one Media|tor between God and men<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 5.</NOTE>:</Q> as plainly, That <Q>there is but One God, the Father, of whom are all things,</Q> as that there is but <Q>One Lord, Je&s;us Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. viii. 6.</NOTE></Q> And the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing title or characteri&s;tic of this One God, in the new te&s;tament, is, "The God and father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t"<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 3.</NOTE>. He, undoubtedly it is, that exclu&s;ively of all other beings, is here &s;tiled the "Lord God Almighty"; the "King of Saints"; and of whom it is &s;aid, that He "only is holy", &amp;c. And certainly it is equally our duty and our intere&s;t to fear; glorify and obey, this <Q>One Lawgiver, who is able to &s;ave and to de|&s;troy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Jam. iv. 12.</NOTE>;</Q> the <Q>Father of all, who is above all, and thro' all, and in us all<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 6.</NOTE>;</Q> who is God omni|pre&s;ent, even "from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting". Is it not altogether rea&s;onable for us, weak, depen|dent, imperfect creatures, to reverence, wor&s;hip, and obey Him that made us, and all things? Him, in whom "we live, and move, and have our being? Him, in whom all conceivable perfections, whether natural or moral, are united, even in an infinite de|gree; (if it be not a &s;oleci&s;m to &s;peak of degrees in infinity, and perfection) and who governs the univer&s;e in the exerci&s;e of the&s;e perfections? Men who do not thus fear and &s;erve God, mu&s;t counteract their own nature; I mean their rational, intellectual and moral

For they cannot but &s;ee and feel, in &s;ome degree at lea&s;t, that they ought to do thus; that they are under an indi&s;pen&s;able obligation, in point of rea&s;on and fit|ne&s;s, as well as intere&s;t, to do it; &s;o that, if they do it not, but the contrary, they mu&s;t needs be <Q>without excu&s;e,</Q> and "condemned of them&s;elves".</P>
<P>IT is no &s;ooner known, that there is really &s;uch a glorious Being exi&s;ting, than every man's own heart even antecedently to any formal, rational proce&s;s, tells him in general, what his duty is; what is the proper, practical inference; how he ought to &s;tand affected towards God; and what part he has to act. And if men will but duly con&s;ider their own frame and make, their rea&s;on will, upon a little reflection, ratify the&s;e fir&s;t dictates of their hearts and con&s;ciences. Are we not &s;o con&s;tituted by the Author of our being, that great power excites a certain awe in us, unle&s;s we are, or at lea&s;t imagine our&s;elves to be, more power|ful that He, in whom we ob&s;erve it? Does not a common man almo&s;t &s;hudder at the thoughts of a giant; one of the &s;ons of <HI>Anak,</HI> even tho' he knows he is long &s;ince dead, and can do him no harm? Does not &s;uperior wi&s;dom among&s;t men, naturally attract re&s;pect and reverence? I mean, from all who have them|&s;elves wi&s;dom enough to di&s;cern it? Is not this our reverence of &s;uperior wi&s;dom heightened, when that wi&s;dom is in conjunction with veracity, and ju&s;tice duly tempered with goodne&s;s and mercy? I mean, &s;o as not to degenerate into cruelty on one hand, nor

into any childi&s;h weakne&s;&s;es on the other? Is not our reverence &s;till heightened, when the&s;e qualities are found in age? in one, who&s;e head was hoary, even before we &s;aw the light? Is it not &s;till increa&s;ed, if this &s;ame per&s;on is our prince and lawgiver, and one on who&s;e protection we depend? (a &s;uppo&s;ition which, God be prai&s;ed! we may now make with &s;ome propriety&mdash;) Yea, would not our reverence of him be &s;till greater, if we were in his pre&s;ence, and under his eye, than while he is ab&s;ent from us, or we from him?

difficult to be comprehended, but what would an&s;wer them all in the affirmative, if he &s;incerely &s;poke the dictates of his heart, without indulging to chicanery, and to the making of &s;ubtile eva&s;ions.

<P>THE obligations we are under in general religi|ou&s;ly to reverence, wor&s;hip and obey God, being, as I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ufficiently evident: it may be proper to &s;ubjoin here, that God's holy word ought to be the rule of the wor&s;hip, &s;ervice and obedience which we pay to him. How greatly the chri&s;tian religion has been, and &s;till is corrupted, in mo&s;t countries where it is profe&s;&s;ed, even to the introduction of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;uper&s;titions and idolatries, there is neither time nor occa&s;ion now particularly to mention.

That for the &s;ame general rea&s;on that we ought not to go wholly over to that apo&s;tate church which the &s;criptures &s;ometimes intend by the name Babylon, we ought not to conform to, or &s;ymbolize with her, in any of her corruptions, and idolatrous u&s;ages: but to keep at as great a di&s;tance from them as po&s;&s;ible, by &s;trictly adhering to the holy &s;criptures in doctrine, di&s;cipline, wor&s;hip and practice.

<HEAD>PART V. Practical Reflections upon the Subject, relative to the Occa&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>BUT it is perhaps more than time for me to proceed to the practical part of my di&s;cour&s;e; and to apply the &s;ubject to our&s;elves and the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. We have lately had a very &s;triking and awakening memento, or rather example, of the great|ne&s;s, and the marvellous nature of God's works; when this continent, for eight or nine hundred miles together, with the neighbouring i&s;lands, and the At|lantic ocean, were at once &s;haken, and thrown into convul&s;ions. That this is truly the work of God, and that it is both a great and marvellous one, I &s;up|po&s;e I need not go about to prove to you, after what has been &s;aid above. Indeed, if I mi&s;take not, you all di&s;cover'd plainly enough, that this was your &s;en&s;e of it, at the time of this event, to &s;ay nothing of what you have done &s;ince, or do at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>YOU think then, that an Earthquake is one of the mighty works of God; You think ju&s;tly. And when|ever you behold, or experience the&s;e his great and marvellous works, it may well excite your fear of him: for how gloriou&s;ly terrible in maje&s;ty is that Being, who is able to produce &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing effects! But &s;hall I tell you, that you every day behold greater works than the&s;e? far more illu&s;trious di&s;plays and manife&s;tations of the power of God? This is really
<PB N="49" REF="007486_0048_102B9E8C58D671B8">
the truth. Did not God create the whole earth? Does he not daily uphold it in being, with all that it contains? And is not the creating and upholding the whole, a far greater work than &s;haking and removing a &s;mall part of it? Certainly it is. You can, there|fore, never look upon the earth even when it does not quake, without being &s;ilently admoni&s;hed to fear and obey him that made it; as truly admoni&s;hed to do &s;o, as when the "pillars of heaven tremble", and the "Highe&s;t gives his voice"; tho' &s;ome may, per|haps, have never attended to this &s;ilent and con&s;tant admonition. But when you extend your views be|yond this earth, to the numerous worlds around; when you look up in a &s;erene night, and attentively behold this gloriou&s;ly "dreadful ALL"; when you &s;ee "worlds on worlds," and &s;y&s;tems on &s;y&s;tems "compo&s;ing one univer&s;e;" when you &s;eriou&s;ly con|template Him, who&s;e hand once form'd, and &s;till gra&s;ps, and moves, and directs this &s;tupendous and amazing Whole; whenever you do thus, I &s;ay, you cannot but think even an earthquake, or the earth it&s;elf, comparatively &s;peaking, a little work; a far le&s;s, than innumerable others. One principal rea&s;on why an earthquake appears to be &s;uch a great and &s;tupendous work as it does to mo&s;t people, is becau&s;e, in&s;tead of enlarging their minds by contemplating objects that are truly great, they narrow them by at|tending only to little things; &s;uch toys and trifles, I mean, as are found in this world, the riches and vani|ties
<PB N="50" REF="007486_0049_102B9E8FA270D948">
of it; the pomps, the thrones, the &s;cepters and diamems of kings. It is not &s;trange that they who can think &s;uch little things great, and admire them as being &s;o; they who&s;e thoughts are ever grovelling on the ground on which they tread, and never a&s;cend above it; it is not &s;trange, I &s;ay, that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould be a&s;toni&s;hed at the grandeur of an earthquake, even though they had nothing to fear from &s;uch an event. For it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that there is nothing, I mean no merely natural occurrence or event in this world, which can more properly be called great, than &s;uch an one. But to a contemplative man, as was intimated before, there are many other works of God, which &s;till more fully declare his power and glory; and which are therefore to &s;uch men louder calls to reverence and obey him; tho' le&s;s calculated to mini|&s;ter terror and amazement.</P>
<P>WHEN we behold, or reflect upon, the great and marvellous works of God, all-powerful, wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t and good the effect hereof &s;hould not be the exciting in us a fruitle&s;s admiration of, and a&s;toni&s;h|ment at them; but the exciting in us a due reverence and e&s;teem of of Him, who&s;e works they are; till from admiring them, we come to admire, to fear, to love nothing be&s;ides Him, the Lord God almighty, the King of &s;aints, who only is holy. For all his works are little, in compari&s;on of Him; and can claim no regard or notice, any farther than they may help to lead us to the knowledge, and to worthy concep|tions of Him. And unle&s;s our thoughts are thus led
<PB N="51" REF="007486_0050_102B9E91CAEFA6F0">
to God from his works, &s;o as to in&s;pire us with the re|verence, love and admiration of him, we had almo&s;t as good &s;tare at puppet-&s;hows, as contemplate the heavens.</P>
<P>AN earthquake is indeed very peculiarly adapted to rou&s;e and awaken the minds of the incon&s;ide|rate, and of tho&s;e who forget God; and to beget in them that fear of him, which is <Q>the the beginning of wi&s;dom;</Q> more adapted to this end, even than the greater and more con&s;tant mani|fe&s;tations of his eternal power and godhead. This is evident from the effect: for many who di&s;regard the&s;e con&s;tant di&s;plays of God's power, and other per|fections, from year to year, are yet alarmed by an earthquake, and impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;erious &s;en&s;e of re|ligion. How many, who were perhaps never excited to fear God, by beholding the heavens, which declare his glory, <Q>the moon and the &s;tars which he has or|dained,</Q> have been excited hereto, by the&s;e late occurrences of his providence? Where is that &s;inner, &s;o tho'tle&s;s, &s;o &s;tupid and abandoned, who&s;e <Q>fle&s;h did not tremble for fear of God, and who was not afraid of his judgments,</Q> when the earth &s;o lately &s;hook and trembled? Nor were the&s;e fears excited in them without the highe&s;t rea&s;on, when we reflect that God has often declared in his holy word, that earthquakes are, &s;ometimes at lea&s;t, &s;ent in his righte|ous di&s;plea&s;ure; not meerly for the warning and ad|monition of &s;ome &s;inners, but for the de&s;truction of others: And when we reflect what amazing de&s;ola|tion

he has often actually wrought by them in the earth! Some recent examples and in&s;tances whereof, we have indeed, now within a day or two, heard of in Europe: The particulars of which are &s;o awful and terrible, that I &s;hall not now enumerate them; for I have no inclination, were it in my power, to throw you in a panic; but only to rea&s;on calmly with you <Q>of righteou&s;ne&s;s, temperance and judgment to come;</Q> of your obligation to fear and obey Him, who&s;e works are thus great and marvellous, and his judg|ments thus made manife&s;t in the earth<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Since the delivering of this di&s;cour&s;e, we have had an account of the more awful and amazing di&s;truction of the city of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> St. <HI>Eubes,</HI> &amp;c. the events alluded to above, being the effects of the earthquake at <HI>Cadiz</HI> and <HI>Seville,</HI> of which we had heard at that time.

only natural, but ju&s;t and proper for wicked men to tremble and to be afraid, when God thus ari&s;eth to &s;hake terribly the earth, and his judgments are abroad in it. And if their own lives are &s;pared, they ought not only to tremble at, but to learn righ|teou&s;ne&s;s from, the&s;e alarming events.

No: how wicked &s;oever &s;ome of you might po&s;&s;ibly be; yet you all then feared God; or at lea&s;t were afraid of him, and afraid to &s;in again&s;t him; becau&s;e

you then really believed him to be holy, ju&s;t and al|mighty.

again, he is always the &s;ame holy, righteous, power|ful and jealous God, which you lately conceived him to be, when he "looked upon it": He is the &s;ame when he dwells in the calm, and all nature &s;miles around, as when he "makes darkne&s;s his &s;ecret place," and "flies upon the wings of the wind," when he gives his voice in thunder, <Q>a &s;moke going out of his no&s;trils, and fire out of his mouth, devouring!</Q></P>

<P>I WOULD willingly hope there may be &s;ome good effects of the late terrible earthquake, not only in this capital, where people have appeared to be &s;o ge|nerally affected by it; but throughout the province; and indeed throughout the&s;e American plantations and colonies, as far at lea&s;t as it extended. Without run|ning into a common-place invective again&s;t the times, or pretending to give a detail of the &s;ins and vices which are prevalent thro'out the&s;e Briti&s;h colonies, one may, I think, &s;ay with mode&s;ty, that there is am|ple room for, and therefore great need of, a general reformation of manners; even among&s;t per&s;ons of all orders and degrees, without any exception. This alarming occurrence of providence, is, in the nature of it, as a moral means, calculated to produce &s;uch an

effect, &s;uch a reformation. And con&s;idering our lives are all thus mercifully pre&s;erved, one would willing|ly believe that God really meant it to us for good; that we might awake to righteou&s;ne&s;s and not &s;in; that we might be made partakers of his holine&s;s here|by; and &s;o become the &s;utable objects of, and in due time enjoy, his favour; that kind protection, and tho&s;e &s;miles of his providence, which we at all times need, and, in &s;ome re&s;pects, more particularly at this.</P>
<P>TO mention only one of the&s;e re&s;pects: We are, and have been for &s;ome time engaged in an unhap|py, and, hitherto, an unpro&s;perous war with our French neighbours on the continent, and their Indian allies, &s;upported and encouraged in their encroach|ments and depredations by the power of France: With which martial, though perfidious nation, a more general war &s;eems to be now on the point of breaking out.

What &s;cenes of violence! of rapine! of fire! of murder! e&s;pecially on the frontiers of the &s;outhern colonies!</P>
<P>NOW though we have not, that I know of, any rea&s;on to doubt of the ju&s;tne&s;s of our cau&s;e, with reference to our enemies on the continent; yet from God's fighting again&s;t us in his holy providence; from his thus defeating our attempts; from his thus giving our barbarian, and even wor&s;e than barbarian enemies, our blood to drink; from his making us ap|pear, not only not formidable, but even contemptible and ridiculous in their eyes; &s;o that they laugh, and "eat us up as they eat bread!"&mdash;From God's thus fighting again&s;t us in his holy providence, I &s;ay, we have great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that we do not &s;tand right with him as a people that is called by his name; but that we have before made him our enemy, by fight|ing and rebelling again&s;t him. Who, indeed, can doubt but that this is the ca&s;e, if he &s;eriou&s;ly re|flects, how little there is of pure and undefiled religion among&s;t us? or rather, how much there is of flagrant immorality, profanene&s;s and irreligion, throughout the&s;e colonies? I &s;ay the&s;e things from my heart; and hope they will not be looked upon only as words of cour&s;e: For I do not allow my&s;elf to trifle with my Maker, or to take his holy and venerable name in vain, even in a Sermon, which would not &s;anctify

the deed. And there have been many other things of late years, in the cour&s;e of divine providence to|wards us, be&s;ides tho&s;e mentioned, which might ju&s;tly make us fear, that God is greatly provoked at our &s;ins.</P>
<P>THE late vi&s;itation of his providence in the formi|dable earthquake, which extended almo&s;t throughout the&s;e Briti&s;h colonies, &s;eems to me, if I can under|&s;tand the language in which it &s;peaks, to be a loud call to them all to con&s;ider of their ways; and to re|turn to God by unfeigned repentance, and a general reformation. It is to be hoped, that none of them which have heard, will di&s;regard the admonition; or &s;o &s;oon forget it: as the &s;ame &s;ort of warnings are forgotten in <HI>&s;ome</HI> of our We&s;t-India I&s;lands, where they are more frequent; where there has been at lea&s;t ONE, which &s;hould never be forgotten; and where, neverthele&s;s, by what we hear, the wickedne&s;s of the people is increa&s;ed to the very heavens, &s;o that were not God's mercies far above them, we might conclude that their utter ruin and de&s;truc|tion could not be long deferred!

to love with a tender and unfeigned charity, your mo&s;t malicious and abu&s;ive enemies&mdash;So &s;hall you act up to your holy profe&s;&s;ion; &s;o &s;hall you be follow|ers of them who thro' faith and patience inherit the promi&s;es; &s;o &s;hall you act &s;utably to the relation in which you &s;tand to Je&s;us Chri&s;t <Q>the Son of the living God,</Q> who "is not a&s;hamed to call you brethren:" And &s;o &s;hall you be emphatically the children of your Father which is in heaven; <Q>for he maketh his &s;un to ri&s;e on the evil and on the good; and &s;endeth rain on the ju&s;t and on the unju&s;t&mdash;Be ye there|fore perfect, even as your Father which is in hea|ven is perfect.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mat. v. 45&mdash;48.</NOTE></Q></P>

<P>THE Author of the foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e takes this oppor|tunity to correct &s;ome mi&s;takes in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to the two Di&s;cour&s;es, which he lately publi&s;hed upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable apertures and cha&s;ms made in the ground by the late earthquake, were not, as he then &s;uppo&s;ed, in the town of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> but in <HI>Scituate,</HI> near if not adjoining to it.</P>
<P>The accounts which he mentioned concerning the dividing of a great hill upon <HI>Cape-Cod,</HI> in halves, and of a prodigious cha&s;m at <HI>Newington,</HI> (of which accounts he then &s;poke doubtfully) now appear to have been without foundation.</P>
<P>The &s;entence which &s;tands thus, p. 3. of the <HI>Appendix,</HI> <Q>This was as much more con&s;iderable than the la&s;t on tue&s;day morn|ing, as that was le&s;s con&s;iderable than the fir&s;t,</Q> ought to have run thus&mdash;This was <HI>almo&s;t</HI> as much more con&s;iderable than the la&s;t on tue&s;day morning, as <HI>it</HI> was le&s;s, &amp;c.</P>
<P>From what we have heard from <HI>Halifax</HI> &s;ince the publi&s;hing his <HI>Appendix,</HI> and from St. <HI>Martin'</HI>s, re&s;pecting the inundation there, on the &s;ame day the earthquake happened here, it is at lea&s;t probable that the extent of the earthquake was twice as great as he then conjectured.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly: Whereas he incidentally gave it as his opinion, that the cour&s;e of the earthquake was from S. W. to the N. E. he now thinks it much more probable, that it was nearly from N. W. to S. E. agreeable to what the very learned and worthy PROFESSOR of the <HI>Math.</HI> &amp; <HI>Phil.</HI> at our College, has &s;aid in the notes to his Di&s;cour&s;e on earthquakes, &s;ince publi&s;hed&mdash;A Di&s;|cour&s;e which (if one who was &s;o lately his pupil, might pre&s;ume to give his opinion) cannot fail to do great honor to its Author, to the learned &s;ociety of which he is a member, and to his coun|try: Even notwith&s;tanding what Mr. <HI>L. Evans</HI> has, with &s;uffici|ent a&s;&s;urance, a&s;&s;igned as <Q>a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for paying <HI>Phila|delphia</HI> the particular di&s;tinction of making it the fir&s;t Meridian of America;</Q> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That it <Q>FAR EXCELS in the progre&s;s of letters, mechanic arts, and the public &s;pirit of its inhabitants,</Q> all other parts of the "Briti&s;h dominions on this continent!"<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Evans'</HI>s Analy&s;is to a general Map, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 1.</NOTE>&mdash;But I am not &s;o rude as to make invidious compari&s;ons betwixt the&s;e governments in point of literature; or to &s;ay, Who is, or is not, THE BEST JUDGE IN AMERICA",<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dedication of Mr. <HI>Evans'</HI>s Map.</NOTE> of this gentleman's late Map&mdash;</P>
