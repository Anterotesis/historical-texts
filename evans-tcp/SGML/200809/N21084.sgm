<OPENER><SALUTE>CANDID READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> HAVING &s;ome time ago publi&s;hed a let|ter, re&s;pecting the di&s;tinction of the Holy Gho&s;t's bap|ti&s;m from the common graces of the Spirit, a cer|tain Mo&s;es Brown, of Rhode-I&s;land, charges me with the blunder, in &s;aid letter, of endeavouring to make di&s;tinctions where the &s;criptures make none, and judges I have manife&s;ted partiality on the &s;ub|ject. Upon which I would ob&s;erve, as the be&s;t of men are but men at be&s;t, I do not pretend to &s;ee but in part, and under&s;tand but in part, and how far I have been partial or &s;hall continue &s;o, I am not, perhaps, &s;o proper a judge, as the candid reader may be. I have not knowingly changed the &s;en&s;e of any text I have quoted in my Letters, as I conceived of it. I have &s;ometimes added words explanatory of what I con|ceived a text to mean. I de&s;ire to be corrected in
<PB N="iv" REF="027695_0003_0FD5E17E2A9B1EA8">
any word or &s;entence, wherein it appears I have erred. I would not knowingly ju&s;tify a mi&s;take, becau&s;e I made it. I am not &s;en&s;ible of feeling a triumphant Spirit, as hinted by friend B. over any per&s;on or community that differ from me in &s;enti|ment. I fully believe there are numbers among different denominations who are for Chri&s;t, altho' they do not follow the bapti&s;t. Nor do I allow my|&s;elf to ca&s;t reflections on any per&s;on, or community, but de&s;ire to do as I would be done by.</P>
<P>And although it is not agreeable to our feelings to be contradicted, it is not an unfriendly part, for one to try to convince another of his error, in a chri&s;tian manner. If any &s;hould try, in &s;uch a way, to con|vince me, or prevent others from being mi&s;led by me, I tru&s;t I &s;hall not think hard of it. I would ob&s;erve concerning my mention of Barcklay, in my letter, I have heard friends mention, and quote him in &s;uch &s;ort as gave me &s;u&s;picion that his authority with them was equal to the &s;criptures, if not &s;uperior; although I did not &s;uppo&s;e they were &s;en&s;ible of it. I have thought the &s;ame of others, re&s;pecting Calvin, Ar|minius and other great names which have been dig|nified by their favourite followers; but I did not think &s;o of all of any denomination: Neither would I be under&s;tood &s;o to mean re&s;pecting the friends, but
<PB N="v" REF="027695_0004_0FD5E17FAA9B6110">
confe&s;s my expre&s;&s;ion was made in too univer&s;al a manner, and I reque&s;t friend B. and all others, who have or may be offended with reading the expre&s;&s;ion to forgive it. As it had no relation to the proof of what I was upon, had I not overlooked it, I &s;hould have razed it; and de&s;ire for the future it may be &s;o con&s;idered. I am &s;en&s;ible he that undertakes to confute what he calls error, &s;hould him&s;elf be a lover of truth and of mankind. What I have wrote in the following &s;heets, I have wrote in the &s;incerity of my con&s;cience, without any de&s;ire either to con|tend with any who have written before me, or to pre|judice the more elaborate pains of any that &s;hall come after me in this kind. If any reader is able to make it appear that I have contradicted the con&s;i&s;tent line of apo&s;tolic truth, either in the following &s;heets, or what I have publi&s;hed heretofore re&s;pecting the Friends or Paedobapti&s;ts, in&s;tead of being offended, I tru&s;t I &s;hall thank him for his help provided he doth it in a chri&s;tian manner. I am &s;en&s;ible of the im|perfection of all human knowledge, and that it is dif|ficult to a&s;certain the exact &s;en&s;e of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the divine oracles. If any reader finds, by having further light than I have attained, that I have made any mi&s;take, I de&s;ire his pity; and wherein he will &s;hew me I have erred as a man, I will en|deavour
<PB N="vi" REF="027695_0005_0FD5E181945B9028">
he &s;hall &s;ee that as a chri&s;tian, it was not my want of love to the truth, but want of light to di&s;|cover it, that mi&s;led me. I pray the Father of lights, the author of truth, the giver of grace, may enlight|en the mind of the reader&punc; to di&s;tingui&s;h the truth of God from the errors of men. That as a child of the true light, he may walk in the true faith and divine teaching of the Holy Spirit, in a con&s;tant cour&s;e of holine&s;s, until he is made ready for the in|heritance of the &s;aints in glory.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A SCRIPTURAL ENQUIRY, &amp;c.</HI> To the friends who have reque&s;ted my thoughts on <HI>Mo&s;es Brown's</HI> an&s;wer to my third letter, re&s;pect|ing the &s;criptural account of the bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t and Fire.</HEAD>
<P>I HERE &s;end you the ob&s;ervations I have made in the cour&s;e of reading his publica|tion. I judge the con&s;i&s;tent evidence of the holy &s;criptures, is the only rule to determine which is in the mi&s;take, he or my&s;elf. Friend B. &s;ays, I &s;hall not find any of their men of note, or authors, who admit that it ever was a duty under the go&s;pel to be baptized in water, page 4. In the &s;ame page they allow, (as he &s;aith) it was practi&s;ed by &s;ome of the Apo&s;tles for a &s;ea&s;on, as was circumci&s;ion, &amp;c. but that it was ever en|joined as a go&s;pel ordinance, they di&s;&s;ent. He further, in the &s;ame page, conceives Paul was made able to &s;ee and di&s;tingui&s;h between the preceeding di&s;pen&s;ation of the law of John, and that of the go&s;pel, &amp;c. Hence it is evident, according to his and their opinion, that &s;ome of the Apo&s;tles, as well as the bapti&s;ts, were in a mi&s;take in baptizing with water. In a word, Brown's &s;uper&s;tructure, erected again&s;t my 3d. letter, is built upon two pillars, which if I can remove by fairly comparing expre&s;s &s;ciptures, it
<PB N="8" REF="027695_0007_0FD5E18A86FF90A0">
mu&s;t &s;urely fall. It is evident he holds John's mini&s;try was a middle di&s;pen&s;ation, between old and new te&s;tament times; or a &s;econd law, after Mo&s;es, before Chri&s;t; for he terms it the law of John, page 4. This I conceive to be his great e&s;&s;ential pillar. The &s;econd, which re|&s;pects the bapti&s;m of the holy gho&s;t and fire, from the be&s;t light he has offered, page 9th, he &s;ays, <HI>"Through or by the bapti&s;mal influences of his ho|ly &s;pirit, with which he will baptize his believing fol|lowers, and through the melting, humbling effects threof he will clean&s;e, purify and fit them for him&s;elf."</HI> From which quotation, with &s;ome other words of like import, in his publication, I conceive he holds, as I ob&s;erved in my 3d letter, that tho&s;e graces of the &s;pirit, which have been experienc|ed by regenerate &s;ouls, from Abel's day until now are what the new te&s;tament means by &s;pirit|ual bapti&s;m. Now if I can make it appear by expre&s;s &s;cripture texts, that his fir&s;t pillar is groundle&s;s, and contrary to the &s;criptural ac|count of John's mini&s;try, and by a fair compari|&s;on of &s;undry texts, &s;hew that tho&s;e graces of faith, repentance, love and humility, which have been commonly experienced by &s;aints, ages be|fore the bapti&s;m of the holy gho&s;t was named, are not once called bapti&s;m; and that the mi|raculous power from on high, the gift or opera|tion of the &s;pirit on the day of Penteco&s;t, and a|bout that time; enabling unlearned men to &s;peak in the languages of all nations, is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the bapti&s;m of the holy gho&s;t, the gift of the holy gho&s;t, &amp;c. And that no other operation of the &s;pirit is called by the word bap|ti&s;m: Then it will appear the mi&s;take or blun|der
<PB N="9" REF="027695_0008_0FD5E18BB2C734E0">
he has endeavoured to throw upon me, be|longs to the Friends; and what I publi&s;hed, is a &s;criptural truth. But how &s;hall I prove it to a demon&s;tration? If I can bring a number of texts which expre&s;sly &s;peak concerning the mi|ni&s;try of John, and declare he preached the kingdom of God, and that John's mini&s;try was the beginning of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, will that prove friend B. is mi&s;taken in his opinion, con|cerning John's preceeding law? I tru&s;t it will to every unprejudiced reader, whether it &s;atisfies the friends or not. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord declares, Luke xvi. 16. the law and the prophets were un|til John; &s;ince that time the kingdom of God is preached, &amp;c. Matt. xi. 13. For all the pro|phets and the law prophe&s;ied until John, and in the foregoing ver&s;e he &s;ays, from the days of John the bapti&s;t until now, &amp;c. Take notice, reader, from the days, not from the ending of the days of John. Which mode of expre&s;&s;ion, hath re&s;pect to the days of a man's acting in pub|lic life, and not to days after he is dead. Fur|ther, what friend B. calls the preceeding law of John, St. Mark expre&s;sly calls the beginning of the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Son of God.&mdash; Thus it appears manife&s;t by the expre&s;s account given by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and St. Mark, that John's mini&s;try was no law preceeding the go&s;pel, but was in fact the beginning of the go&s;pel it&s;elf, if we credit the in&s;pired te&s;timonies, rather than the friends opinion.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urdity, of holding John's mini&s;try as a middle di&s;pen&s;ation, is further manife&s;t, if we do but con&s;ider. The legal di&s;pen&s;ation was founded upon the old covenant, and the go&s;pel
<PB N="10" REF="027695_0009_0FD5E18D6796EEF8">
di&s;pen&s;ation upon the new covenant, which con|tains the old and new te&s;taments. The &s;crip|ture further &s;aith not, neither do they &s;peak one word of a middle covenant, between the law and the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ations, to found a middle di&s;|pen&s;ation upon: con&s;equently there is no more foundation for the friends opinion, than to hold there is a middle te&s;tament between the old and the new. This great mi&s;take has led B. as I con|ceive, to pervert the true &s;en&s;e of &s;everal texts, he has quoted, which I &s;hall notice in their place.</P>
<P>It is evident from Paul's te&s;timony, in the viiith. and ixth. chapters of Heb. that the figu|rative in&s;titutions of the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation, were to la&s;t until the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation commenced, and no longer. The prophecies of I&s;a. Mal. and others, foretold the events, that would introduce the beginning of the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash; Hence it is evident, when God began to bring to pa&s;s what the Prophets foretold, then the go&s;|pel di&s;pen&s;ation did &s;urely take place; and we have no other way to know, left on the holy re|cords. It is further evident, the Prophets fore|told &s;everal particurlar events that would con&s;ti|tute a &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation; the fulfilment of &s;aid events, began with the mini&s;try of John Bapti&s;t; therefore his mini&s;try was a new te&s;ta|ment mini&s;try. Witne&s;s, Chri&s;t's te&s;timony of him, Matt. xi. 10. For this is he of whom it is written, refering to Mal. iii. 1. Behold I &s;end my me&s;&s;enger before thy face, &amp;c. ver&s;e 14th, and if you will receive it, this is Elias which was for to come, &amp;c. Zachariah under the influence of the holy gho&s;t, gives in his witne&s;s, that John
<PB N="11" REF="027695_0010_0FD5E18F8553EC10">
Bapti&s;t's mini&s;try, was a new covenant mini&s;try, Luke i. 76 and 77. And thou, child, &s;hall be called the prophet of the highe&s;t; for thou &s;halt go before the face of the Lord, &amp;c. To give knowledge of &s;alvation unto his people, by the remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins. Thus it is evident, John's mini&s;try, was a mini&s;try of repentance for the re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins: and as much connected with e|ternal life, as the repentance the Apo&s;tles were &s;ent to preach in Chri&s;t's name, among all na|tions, Luke xxiv. 47. They were both preached for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, being one &s;ort of repent|ance under one and the &s;ame go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. Further, John's mini&s;try was allowed and conti|nued by the mini&s;try of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles: This is evident by our Lord's preaching, Luke iv. 18, 19. From I&s;a. lxi. Proclaiming liberty to captives, &amp;c. and the acceptable year of the Lord. This go&s;pel day or acceptable year of the Lord, if we believe Chri&s;t's expo&s;ition, in his preaching concerning what it meant; Chri&s;t &s;ays, Luke iv. 21. This day, is this &s;cripture fulfilled in your ears; which day B. with &s;ome Paedobapti&s;ts, hold, was before the go&s;pel di&s;pen|&s;ation, &s;o the reader mu&s;t judge for him&s;elf. Fur|ther, the go&s;pel was not only preached by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, while John's mini&s;try continued, but he in the &s;ame time &s;ent out his Apo&s;tles; and they went through the towns preaching the go&s;pel, &amp;c. Luke ix. It is evident, as words can expre&s;s it, that Chri&s;t the King, was per&s;onally among them, they were told by the heavenly voice, when he came up out of the water of Jordan, to hear him. His di&s;ciples, the &s;ubjects of his kingdom were with him; and the laws of Chri&s;t, were taught
<PB N="12" REF="027695_0011_0FD5E1940F73BFE0">
them; no Mountain or Temple enjoined where they mu&s;t repair to wor&s;hip God, but the wilder|ne&s;s at Jordan or Enon, or el&s;ewhere they might &s;piritually wor&s;hip him, who is the great &s;upreme &s;pirit. This was the tenor of the doctrine, taught in the time when friend B. and &s;ome Paedobap|ti&s;ts fancied there was a &s;ort of middle di&s;pen&s;a|tion, or John's di&s;pen&s;ation. Thus I have giv|en abundant &s;cripture proof, that the mini&s;try of John and Chri&s;t, were each a new te&s;tament min|i&s;try, and under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. Thus it is evident, the ordinance of water bapti&s;m, ad|mini&s;tered by John and Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, be|fore his death, was a go&s;pel ordinance. It ori|ginated in the council of God from heaven, and there is not one hint in the &s;cripture, of its being any law of John. Hence it appears, by a fair quotation and compari&s;on of expre&s;s &s;criptures, that friend Brown's fir&s;t pillar is removed, and his idea of John's being a law giver, and his min|i&s;try being a law di&s;pen&s;ation, I conceive is al|together un&s;criptural and imaginary. Friend B. calls John's di&s;pen&s;ation, a bapti&s;mal di&s;pen|&s;ation, page 8. It is evident he means water bapti&s;m; and where as I have plainly &s;hewn by a number of expre&s;s texts, it was a go&s;pel di&s;|pen&s;ation, therefore water bapti&s;m is a go&s;pel in|&s;titution.</P>
<P>Secondly, Friend Brown's &s;econd pillar con|&s;i&s;ts, if I under&s;tand him, in making out that there is no di&s;tinction between the melting, humbling, clean&s;ing or purifying effects of the &s;pirit, fitting believers for him&s;elf, and the holy gho&s;t bapti&s;m. Now if I can &s;hew by a fair compari&s;on of &s;criptures, that a number of in|&s;pired
<PB N="13" REF="027695_0012_0FD5E195721A3BA0">
believers had all he de&s;cribes long before the miraculous gift of the holy gho&s;t (call|ed by the name of the bapti&s;m of the holy gho&s;t and fire) came upon them, then it will evidently appear that the &s;criptures make a real di&s;tinction between the humbling and clean&s;ing effects of the holy &s;pirit, and that miraculous gift and power from on high, called the bapti&s;m of the holy gho&s;t and fire.</P>
<P>But &s;ince I &s;o particularly pointed out a num|ber of expre&s;s texts, in my 3d letter, and a num|ber of &s;criptural in&s;tances, wherein the di&s;tinc|tion the apo&s;tles have made, is as plain to be di&s;tingui&s;hed in their writings, as a man's eyes that you look on, is to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from his no&s;e or mouth, or other features of his face, al|though all belong to one and the &s;ame head.&mdash; I therefore refer the reader to the 3d letter of my fir&s;t publication, and &s;hall only notice that it is evident, John xv. 3. Chri&s;t &s;ays to his di&s;ci|ples, now ye are clean through the word I have &s;poken unto you; abide in me, and I in you, &amp;c. From which it is evident they then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the clean&s;ing and purifying effects of the &s;pirit of truth, which friend B. calls bapti&s;m; and it is equally true that notwith&s;tanding this purifying, clean&s;ing effect of the &s;pirit, they were command|ed, Luke xxiv. 49. to tarry at Jeru&s;alem until they were endued with power from on high. What this power means you may &s;ee, Acts i. 8. But ye &s;hall receive power after the holy gho&s;t is come upon you, &amp;c. which plainly &s;hews they did not po&s;&s;e&s;s that power when Chri&s;t a&s;cended out of their &s;ight; but in Acts ii. 3.4. we have this power of the holy gho&s;t de&s;cribed. And there
<PB N="14" REF="027695_0013_0FD5E196E9ABB980">
appeared unto them cloven tongues like as fire, and it &s;et upon each of them, and they were all filled with the holy gho&s;t, and began to &s;peak with other tongues, &amp;c. This was the fulfilment of what John Bapti&s;t told the Jews, Mat. iii. 11. and as he was Chri&s;t's fir&s;t mini&s;ter under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;o he was the fir&s;t that di&s;tingui&s;h|ed this divine miraculous gift and power of the holy gho&s;t, by its name, bapti&s;m of the holy gho&s;t, &amp;c. And this di&s;tinction is particularly made in a number of places in the apo&s;tles wri|tings. And friend B. I conceive, might as well have &s;aid, there is no di&s;tinction between the operation of the &s;pirit, &s;poken of in 1 Cor. xii. that enabled one to work a miracle that could not foretell things to come; and another to fore|tell things to come, but could not work a mira|cle. Paul was in&s;pired to di&s;tingui&s;h the differ|ent operations, and call them diver&s;ities of gifts, although it was performed by the agency of one and the &s;ame &s;pirit; and the di&s;tinction of the gift of the holy gho&s;t, the power from on high which enabled tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it to &s;peak with tongues, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the bap|ti&s;m of the holy gho&s;t and fire, is as expre&s;sly and particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other op|erations of the &s;pirit, as any account of the di|ver&s;ity of the gifts of the &s;pirit recorded in the new te&s;tament. Thus it is evident from the ex|pre&s;s te&s;timony of the Apo&s;tles, that friend Brown's &s;econd pillar has no &s;cripture te&s;timo|nies to &s;tand upon.</P>
<P>Brown has made, I conceive, an artful cant upon my words, in page 11, and repre&s;ents the matter in &s;uch a light, as to &s;ignify, if I can't prove wa|ter
<PB N="15" REF="027695_0014_0FD5E198A5AE0AB8">
bapti&s;m from the commi&s;&s;ion, Mat. xxviii. I &s;eem to doubt of my cau&s;e. See his ob&s;ervation page 22, and all he has produced to prove that &s;aid commi&s;&s;ion means &s;piritual bapti&s;m, is &s;uppo&s;ing that upon his a&s;cen&s;ion he put an end to what he calls figures, and that water is not ex|pre&s;&s;ed, nor the Trinity named when the Apo&s;|tle baptized with water.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ult the Apo&s;tles account concerning their commi&s;&s;ion, Mat. xxviii. we &s;hall find it was only renewed with &s;ome enlargements, and orders to proclaim and teach all nations, in&s;tead of being confined to the cities of I&s;rael. He hav|ing given them the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance, &s;oon after he had called them, viz. in the time of friend Brown's middle di&s;pen&s;ation, witne&s;s Luke vi. 13. He cho&s;e twelve whom al&s;o he named Apo&s;tles, ix. 1, 2. then he called his twelve di&s;ciples to|gether, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure di&s;ea&s;es. And he &s;ent them to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal the &s;ick; ver&s;e 6, and they departed and went through the towns, preaching the go&s;pel and healing every where. Luke &s;peaking of the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion as Mat. xxviii. &s;ays xxiv. 47. and that repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name among all nations. Mark de&s;cribes it exactly xvi. 15. agreeable to the forecited Luke ix. 6. preach the go&s;pel to every creature; excepting the enlargement of their travel. Hence it is evident as words can well expre&s;s it, that Chri&s;t, after his re&s;urrection, only renewed the Apo&s;tles commi&s;&s;ion, and enlarged its extent to all the world, as to baptizing with water although it is not mentioned when the
<PB N="16" REF="027695_0015_0FD5E19D59E50B28" MS="y">
commi&s;&s;ion was fir&s;t given; yet as they did bap|tize with water (for the holy gho&s;t bapti&s;m was not yet given to any) read John iii. 22. After the&s;e things came Je&s;us and his di&s;ciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them and baptized, and John al&s;o was baptizing in Enon, &amp;c. If we compare this a&s;&s;ertion, with the 1&s;t and 2d ver&s;es of the next chapter iv. we &s;hall find it was by his di&s;ciples that Je&s;us bapti|zed. I &s;aid in my 3d letter, by his licence which appears a &s;elf evident truth; for as they did baptize, unle&s;s John has given us a fal&s;e account, for how could it be &s;aid Je&s;us tarried with them, viz. his di&s;ciples and baptized though Je&s;us him|&s;elf baptized not, but his di&s;ciples, unle&s;s the di&s;|ciples did it by his command or licence; if he had not licen&s;ed them to baptize, it would be fal&s;e for John to &s;ay Je&s;us baptized; it was un|que&s;tionably &s;ure therefore, at Chri&s;t's command or licen&s;e, or there doth not appear &s;en&s;e or truth in the texts. Whether Je&s;us baptized by his di&s;ciples, more than John, as the Phari&s;ees had heard, is not the point di&s;puted. John iii. 22. &s;ays, Je&s;us tarried with them, viz, his di&s;ciples and baptized which is proof enough. The com|mi&s;&s;ion, Mat. xxviii. although no water is men|tioned, with the word baptizing; yet as it con|tains the &s;ame original authority, that it did when fir&s;t given, Luke ix. and being directed to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;inners, calling for the &s;ame &s;ort of repentance towards God, and &s;aith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

He doth not &s;ay what&s;oever I now command you, or &s;hall command you when you are baptized with the holy gho&s;t and fire; but the words are expre&s;sly, what&s;oever I have commanded you. Thus, from the &s;everal expre&s;s texts I have quoted and compared, which refer to the very point di&s;puted, it is &s;elf-evident, that the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation and water bapti&s;m, to believers, were in being, under the per&s;onal mini&s;try of Chri&s;t, and were intended to be continued by his order, forecited Mat. xxviii. 20. even to the end of the world. For there is no di&s;pen&s;ation &s;poken of, to take place after the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation began until tho&s;e who were beheaded for the witne&s;s of Je&s;us, live again, to reign with Chri&s;t, &amp;c. Neither have we any account in the new te&s;tament, of any way to plant go&s;pel churches, until the forecited re&s;ur|rection; but to enjoin upon all that profe&s;s their faith in Chri&s;t, to be baptized in water, and re|main &s;tedfa&s;t in the Apo&s;tles doctrine, and fel|low&s;hip, and in breaking of bread, &amp;c. accord|ing to the Apo&s;tles directions and examples, un|der the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Friend B. while he is artfully critical to di&s;al|low of my adding one word as explanatory of the &s;en&s;e of a text, can boldly &s;ay, this and that is thus and &s;o, without giving any proof, but as be takes it to mean &s;o; and becau&s;e the name of the Trinity is mentioned in Mat. xxviii. B. dares to &s;ay the Apo&s;tles in baptizing with water, did not go by that commi&s;&s;ion; which is his &s;ay &s;o but not proved. Becau&s;e as for naming the

Trinity in bapti&s;m, it doth not appear that Chri&s;t commanded it as a form of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;peech, in the admini&s;tration of any &s;ort of bapti&s;m. If it was, he will be equally &s;ilenced to &s;hew one in&s;tance of &s;uch a form, re&s;pecting &s;piritual bapti&s;m, as of water. I conceive, therefore, if any one thinks that Matthew and others were too brief in tneir account of the point di&s;puted, the &s;ub&s;equent practice of the Apo&s;tles, in their preaching and baptizing, and gathering churches, mu&s;t be own|ed as the be&s;t and only explanation of their ma&s;|ter's law and commi&s;&s;ion, Luke ix. Mat. xxviii. and other places. If we compare what they &s;aid and practi&s;ed after they received the en|largement of their commi&s;&s;ion, with the account they gave us before it is manife&s;t that they bap|tized in the faith of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t, when they named the Lord Je&s;us, for in him dwelt the fulne&s;s of the Godhead bod|ily. It is evident from the account given of Peter's teaching the 3000, that he kept his ma&s;|ter's commi&s;&s;ion, to teach all nations, fir&s;t, and when they were taught the go&s;pel, and enquired what they &s;hould do, Peter informs them to re|pent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins: and then promi&s;ed them the gift of the holy gho&s;t. And the general account of all the churches planted by the Apo&s;tles, runs in the &s;ame line. Who can po&s;&s;ibly imagine the Apo&s;|tles did not under&s;tand their commi&s;&s;ion, fir&s;t to teach and then baptize with water, when they &s;o univer&s;ally practi&s;ed it, and never left us a hint of its coming to an end until teaching and believ|ing in the go&s;pel &s;hould come to an end; but
<PB N="19" REF="027695_0018_0FD5E1A46E693DA8" MS="y">
po&s;&s;itively enjoined upon churches to keep the ordinances as they delivered them, without one hint to &s;upport friend Brown's ideas of the matter. For it is evident, that either the Apo&s;tles were not guided into all truth re&s;pecting what they &s;hould teach, as Chri&s;t promi&s;ed they &s;hould be, or el&s;e they were not faithful to reveal it to the church|es in their writings; for no man that is not blind|ed with prejudice, can think, by what the Apo&s;|tles have enjoined, in their planting of churches, but that it was duty for believers to be baptized in water, upon their profe&s;&s;ing their faith in Chri&s;t; and if their enjoining &s;uch a practi&s;e was a mi&s;take, as friend B. would have it, it is evident they did not only live and die in the mi&s;take, but enjoined their mi&s;takes as a duty, without di&s;tinction, to be regarded as long as their te&s;timony is to be believed and obeyed, which is even to the end of the world. Thus, I conceive I am con&s;i&s;tent, in claiming the baptizing in Mat. xxviii. to include water bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o remark re&s;pecting the mi&s;taken &s;en&s;e B. puts upon a &s;entence he has extracted out of Paul's writings, 1 Cor. i. where he &s;ays, <HI>"Paul declares he was not &s;ent to baptize with water, as the context &s;hews; but to preach the go&s;pel"</HI> He has a&s;&s;erted the context &s;hews it, but has offered nothing to manife&s;t how the con|text &s;hews it. I &s;uppo&s;e he meant, if others un|der&s;tood the context in the light he conceives of it. If I may give my opinion of the forecited text and context, with my rea&s;ons, gathered by comparing it with other parts of Paul's writings, I will convey my ideas in general, by a &s;imile, re&s;pecting the ordinance of marriage. Then by
<PB N="20" REF="027695_0019_0FD5E1A7886ABD48">
comparing &s;everal parts of Paul's &s;ame epi&s;tle, I will endeavour to demon&s;trate to every candid reader, that although Paul was primarily &s;ent to preach the go&s;pel, he had al&s;o a right, by virtue of his commi&s;&s;ion as an Apo&s;tle, to baptize in water, &s;uch as profe&s;&s;ed to believe the go&s;pel he preached. Suppo&s;e a bapti&s;t &s;ociety &s;hould re|que&s;t the church to which I belong, to &s;end me as an ordained Elder, to preach the go&s;pel among them. Accordingly I am &s;ent, and while la|bouring among them, there was many married in that place. A few couples de&s;ired me to ad|mini&s;ter the ordinance of marriage to them, ac|cordingly I did. In proce&s;s of time, a great contention aro&s;e among them concerning the or|dinance of marriage. Some held, if he who made the hearts of men, let any &s;ingle male and female, fall in love with each other, it was of the virtue and power of the Lord, and their mutual love, and a &s;ecret agreement, was marriage; deny|ing any outward ceremony or publickly promi&s;ing to prove true to each other, as hu&s;band and wife, before the head of any religious community, church officer, or magi&s;trate, and &s;aid that vi&s;ible marriage was no duty under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;a|tion; giving this rea&s;on, viz. that what &s;hort ac|count we have of the marriage in Cana, John ii. and of our Lord's directions, Luke xiv. how to behave when invited to a wedding, although it evidently implied it was done in a publick man|ner yet it was in the time of John's di&s;pen&s;ation, but not enjoined by the go&s;pel, &amp;c. Others held it valid, or not, according as who married them; &s;ome holding it &s;hould be a mini&s;ter, oth|ers a ju&s;tice of the peace, &amp;c. They &s;eemed to
<PB N="21" REF="027695_0020_0FD5E1A78E8C8490">
become carnal in their contentions, and I not knowing what length their confu&s;ion might carry them, I wrote an epi&s;tle to rectify their mi&s;takes, and fearing tho&s;e few I had married, might &s;ay I married them in my own name, and by my own authority, I wrote to them among other things, that I thanked God I had married but a few couples of them; and gave my rea&s;on ex|pre&s;sly, viz. le&s;t they &s;hould &s;ay I married them in my own name, and then add for the church &s;ent me not to marry but to preach the go&s;pel. Would it hence ju&s;tly follow, that I had no right by my office to marry, becau&s;e I was e&s;|pecially &s;ent to preach the go&s;pel: no, by no means. I have a right as a church officer to ad|mini&s;ter all new te&s;tament ordinances to which I am regularly called. St. Paul had a right to admini&s;ter water bapti&s;m to believers, and like|wi&s;e the Lord's Supper; which he repeatedly did, and &s;aid he received it from the Lord; as I &s;hall now proceed to prove. It is evident from the 11 ver&s;e of the context, Paul was inform|ed by the hou&s;e of Chloe, of the unhappy divi|&s;ions among &s;ome of the Corinthian brethren, and that Paul was too much dignified by a par|ty, &s;aying, I am of Paul, &amp;c. And it is equally evident why Paul thanked God he baptized no more of tho&s;e contending brethren, was, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;ay he had baptized them in his own name; for the preaching of the go&s;pel was his main errand, not baptizing, which others admin|i&s;tered that were not Apo&s;tles. If we read Acts xviii. we &s;hall find Paul taught the word of God among tho&s;e Corinthians one year and &s;ix months; in which time many believed and were baptiz|ed,
<PB N="22" REF="027695_0021_0FD5CD34D810CFF8">
and a go&s;pel church planted, a number of which believers Paul baptized him&s;elf; as the 1&s;t of the epi&s;tle manife&s;ts. In the xith. of the fame epi&s;tle, it appears &s;ome of tho&s;e brethren had got into errors about eating the Lord's &s;up|per, &s;ome walked orderly and prai&s;e-worthy. Therefore to give each one his portion in &s;ea|&s;on, Paul prai&s;es the orderly walkers; take no|tice for what, viz. That ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you. He then proceeds to give &s;ome new directions concerning the conduct of the &s;i&s;ters. Then &s;harply reproves the di&s;orderly partaking of the Lord's &s;upper among &s;ome of them; and reinjoins it, as it &s;hould be performed, charging them to examine them&s;elves, and &s;o eat it, &amp;c. To a&s;&s;ert his authority, he &s;ays, ver. 23d. I have received of the Lord that which al|&s;o I delivered unto you, &amp;c. And gave the &s;ame account of this ordinance under the go&s;pel di&s;|pen&s;ation, that we are told by the Evangeli&s;ts, was given them by our Lord, in the time of Brown's middle di&s;pen&s;ation. Even the &s;ame night in which he was betrayed, &s;ays the Evan|geli&s;ts, &s;o &s;ays Paul. If tho&s;e ordinances of bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper were at an end with the mini&s;try of John, how could Paul &s;ay, I received of the Lord what I delivered unto you; unle&s;s the ordinances he delivered them were to be enjoined to the Gentiles under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. I conceive it is impo&s;&s;ible to evade the force of Paul's te&s;timony, forecited, and hold him to be a man of truth. Thus it is evident, from the mi&s;taken &s;en&s;e B. puts upon Paul's words, 1 Cor. i. he is led to &s;ay, page 6.
<PB N="23" REF="027695_0022_0FD5E1AA92589C08">
that whatever was of water bapti&s;m in the Apo&s;|tles days, was from John, and not from our Lord. Paul &s;ays, in the xith of the &s;ame epi&s;tle, he received what he enjoined upon them from the Lord. So the reader mu&s;t judge which is mi&s;taken, Paul or Brown. Thus Shepard &s;up|po&s;es, upon &s;olemn reflection, Paul had directions from the Lord to enjoin outward ordinances to po&s;terity, to the end of the world.</P>
<P>I would ob&s;erve that friend B. &s;ays, he under|&s;tands Peter in his 1&s;t epi&s;tle iii. 21 means &s;pir|itual bapti&s;m; where he &s;ays, the like figure whereunto even bapti&s;m doth al&s;o now &s;ave us, not the putting away of the filth of the fle&s;h, but the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience toward God, by the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It put me in mind of his ob&s;ervation upon the force of the bias of education, &amp;c. page 4, which is often too true. He thinks I want correction, being too apt to annex the idea of water to the word bap|tize, &amp;c. whether it means &s;o or not, as I take it. Whether friend B. is in danger of annexing the idea of &s;pirit, or &s;piritual, to the word bapti&s;m, whether it means &s;o or not; and whether he has any prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that wants correction or not, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the judgment of the candid reader. I under&s;tand the text refers to the Apo&s;tolic water bapti&s;m. Friend B. has offered no proof or rea&s;|ons, but the judgment of Benjamin Wallin and his own. I offer the following rea&s;ons for the &s;up|port of my opinion of the text. It is evident that our Lord Je&s;us did not under&s;tand that the filth of the fle&s;h, of the hands or face, or other parts of the &s;kin, which the Phari&s;ees were &s;o careful to keep clean, was in a go&s;pel, religious
<PB N="24" REF="027695_0023_0FD5E1B15C1E0750">
&s;en&s;e, to take away the filth of the fle&s;h: but it con&s;i&s;ted in what is taught us, 2 Cor. vii. 1. Having, &amp;c. the&s;e promi&s;es, &amp;c. let us clean&s;e our&s;elves from all filthine&s;s of the fle&s;h &amp;c. James i. 21. wherefore lay apart all filthine&s;s and &s;uperfluity of naughtine&s;s, &amp;c. It is evident that the&s;e two forementioned texts mean the renova|ting, clean&s;ing, humbling influences of the word and &s;pirit, received in the &s;oul by faith, by which the believer crucifies his affections to the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life; all this is effected by the &s;pirit of faith; witne&s;s Peter's te&s;timony, Acts xv. 9. And made no difference between us (Jews) and them (Gentiles) purifying their hearts by faith. The&s;e operations are what friend B. calls &s;piritual bap|ti&s;m; and &s;ays it clean&s;es, purifies, &amp;c. What? The &s;oul that experiences this faith, from the filthine&s;s of the fle&s;h? Peter &s;ays, of the bapti&s;m in the forecited text, not the putting away of the filth of the fle&s;h, but the an&s;wer of a good con|&s;cience, in doing as Peter commanded the 3000, repent and be baptized every one of you, &amp;c. as I under&s;tand it. And I think it is &s;elf evident from friend Brown's definition of &s;piritual bap|ti&s;m, that it does put away the filth of the fle&s;h, in a religious &s;en&s;e; and I hold that a true faith, or what the Apo&s;tle calls the &s;pirit of faith, doth put away the filth, and purify the heart of the believer from all his idols. But the &s;criptures do not call the &s;pirit of faith, nor the grace of humility or repentance, by the name of bapti&s;m. Hence it is certain from friend Brown's own account of &s;piritual bapti&s;m, that Peter mu&s;t re|fer to water bapti&s;m; for that doth not put away
<PB N="25" REF="027695_0024_0FD5E1B43724FD38" MS="y">
the filth of the fle&s;h, that is, as before proved, the pollution of &s;in; but a true believer is vi|&s;ibly and &s;en&s;ibly &s;aved, by keeping faith, when he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, and a good con&s;cience, in obeying the commands of the go&s;pel; a part of which commands, is, that when we believe the apo&s;tolic doctrine, to repent and be baptized in water, and then remain &s;tedfa&s;t in &s;aid doctrine and the fellow&s;hip of the &s;aints, in breaking of bread and prayers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The la&s;t text friend B. mentions, that I rec|ollect he judges much to purpo&s;e is 1 Cor. xii. 13. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one &s;pirit. This text he thinks is &s;o much to his purpo&s;e, that it will determine which is mi&s;taken the Friends or Shepard. I conceive he meant, if every body under&s;tands it as he does. This, he &s;ays, is an expre&s;s pa&s;|&s;age to the contrary of Shepard's po&s;ition. If &s;o, it is no wonder he &s;et con&s;iderable by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, be|ing the only one he has produced in all the new te&s;tament, that he could with propriety &s;o call, as I conceive; nor that neither, with any con|&s;i&s;tency, if we hold there is a con&s;i&s;tency in the whole of the Apo&s;tles account of their preach|ing and planting go&s;pel churches. He &s;eems to manife&s;t an Ideal triumph, that he has found one text, that he thinks is expre&s;s to his purpo&s;e, and &s;eems to jeer me for not recollecting the text, and wraps it up with the re&s;t of my mi&s;|takes, concluding in his la&s;t page, my perform|ance de&s;erves more &s;evere treatment, than he has
<PB N="26" REF="027695_0025_0FD5E1B606531C30">
given it. Perhaps it would not have been ami&s;s for friend B. to have recollected a caution of wi&s;e Solomon, Prov. xviii. 17. He that is fir&s;t in his own cau&s;e &s;eemeth ju&s;t; but his neighbour cometh and &s;earcheth him. Friend B. it &s;eems had no &s;ooner found a text which he thought would do for a handle, but he fixes a &s;courge to it, and began to whip me, &s;tripe upon &s;tripe. It puts me in mind how St. Paul was once &s;erved, Acts xxii. They &s;everely &s;courged him; and on the morrow held a court upon him to know what he had done. So friend B. having con|cluded I could not an&s;wer his text had I recol|lected it, although he has offerd no parallel text to prove he has got the true &s;en&s;e of it; neither can he find one in the bible, I conceive, to ju&s;tify his &s;en&s;e of it; he has therefore made up the lack as well as he could by quoting a famous bapti&s;t writer's opinion in his favour; which is no further proof than that there is another man of his opinion. Friend B. further con|clude the text makes it evident that the words, &s;piritual bapti&s;m, mean &s;omething, and inti|mates that I &s;cruple whether it means any thing, and mu&s;t have lo&s;t my fir&s;t love, (if ever I had any) before I could fall into &s;uch a blunder. As Paul once thought he ought to do many things, which after he was converted he was convinced was wrong, and had he known better he would not have done; &s;o, I conceive friend B. thinks as he &s;ays, and his reflections do not offend me. If I may be allowed, the day after my &s;courg|ing, to an&s;wer for my &s;elf. I would &s;ay, I hold the bapti&s;m of the holy gho&s;t and fire to be a
<PB N="27" REF="027695_0026_0FD5E1BB81F7EBE8">
very great &s;omething. I view it a great ble&s;&s;ing to men that God dignified them above all the animal creation, by giving them one language by which they could communicate their thoughts one to another. I view it a judgment for their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that their language was confound|ed, and thereby the family of our father Adam got divided. I view it one of the greate&s;t acts of Godlike power, recorded in the new-te&s;ta|ment, that God, to prove the certainty of Chri&s;t being his &s;on from heaven, and his word and that of his in&s;pired apo&s;tles, being the word of life. After &s;aid apo&s;tles had got all the graces implanted in them, that friend B. calls &s;piritual bapti&s;m, God endowed them with a miraculous power from on high, called the bapti&s;m of the holy gho&s;t and fire: and by way of eminence, above many other operations of the &s;pirit &s;ome|times called the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t &amp;c. By which di&s;tingui&s;hed gift from all other oper|ations of the &s;pirit the poor ignorant di&s;ciples (as to letter learning) were enabled to preach the glad-tidings of Je&s;us, to every nation under heaven; and tho&s;e nations heard them in their own tongues. Thus God removed the confu&s;ion of languages, at that time, which, I conceive was a great &s;omething, and thus I held it in my 3d letter.</P>
<P>But the words, &s;piritual bapti&s;m, are not put together in the new-te&s;tament by any in&s;pired witne&s;s: neither are faith, love, repentance, &s;anctification or humility, &s;eperately, or all to|gether, once called &s;piritual bapti&s;m. Therefore I &s;aid, if the words, &s;piritual bapti&s;m, mean
<PB N="28" REF="027695_0027_0FD5E1C078C22AA8">
any thing, it is the bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t and fire, and if they do not mean &s;o, there is no meaning to them, when put together. The word, &s;pirit, means &s;omething &s;tanding alone, and bapti&s;m means &s;omething alone; and when they are properly put with other words, they mean different things: but put them together without any other words, and if they don't mean what I &s;aid, there is no meaning be&s;ide that I know of. Thus I have an&s;wered, that the reader may under&s;tand, I hold the bapti&s;m of the Ho|ly Gho&s;t, to be a very great operation, above many other operations &s;poken of in the holy &s;criptures. So great an operation that I never found any chri&s;tian in my knowledge, however ble&s;t with faith, holine&s;s, and humility, with oth|er graces of the &s;pirit, that could prove to me, by any marks given in &s;cripture, that he had the bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t, any more than he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed power to rai&s;e the dead.</P>
<P>In a word, friend Brown's ideas and mine dif|fer primarily in this. Friend B. holds the &s;pirit of faith and the graces of repentance, humility, holine&s;s, &amp;c. are what the &s;criptures mean by the bapti&s;m of the &s;pirit, as he phra&s;es it, if I under&s;tand him. I hold that every &s;aint, from righteous Abel to this day, has experienced the&s;e graces, in their mea&s;ure, or they are not &s;aints; but the&s;e were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the apo&s;tles, before ever they were baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t; as I have already proved by expre&s;s &s;cripture. Therefore being a true beleiver, and a holy, humble chri&s;tian, is not hinted in the new-te&s;ta|ment, to be the bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t, in

any one in&s;tance; but is an un&s;criptural wrong idea, and leads the mind into un&s;criptural prac|tices. The friends are thereby led into a ne|glect of water bapti&s;m, when they believe, and other outward ordinances; contrary to the prac|tice of the apo&s;tolic churches. And a number of paedobapti&s;ts, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trange in|con&s;i&s;tency they manife&s;t, will &s;ay when they can|not &s;upport their infant ranti&s;m, they tru&s;t they are baptized with the &s;pirit, and &s;hall get to heav|en, &amp;c. when they mean no more than that they believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; which, if true, is the very qualification for go&s;pel ordinances. Having made the&s;e remarks to clear up what I meant about the words, &s;piritual bapti&s;m, not knowing where to bring it in with more brevity, I will return to enquire what appears to be the con&s;i&s;tent, &s;criptural meaning of the forecited text, 1 Cor. xii. 13.</P>
<P>If the reader will take notice of what I have ob&s;erved upon the xith chap. of his &s;ame Epi&s;tle, he will find I have expre&s;sly demon&s;trated, by comparing &s;everal parts of the chap. with the xviiith of Acts, that water bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper was admini&s;tered by Paul, and that he had enjoined outward ordinances upon this very church, declaring he received it from the Lord; even what he enjoined to them. Now for Paul to declare all this, and in the next chap. xii. of this &s;ame epi&s;tle, to flatly deny or contradict all he had &s;aid about outward ordin|ance in the foregoing chapter, is &s;o barefaced an incon&s;i&s;tency, that no man can believe it, with|out concluding Paul did not know what he was
<PB N="30" REF="027695_0029_0FD5E1C4A8226DE8">
writing of. I &s;ay it is &s;elf evident tho&s;e words cannot be under&s;tood in friend B's &s;en&s;e, with|out making Paul contradict him&s;elf, and a&s;&s;ert that which is incon&s;i&s;tent with all the other ac|counts that &s;peak of the &s;ame matter throughout the new-te&s;tament. And if another meaning of his favourite text, can be made to appear con&s;i&s;tent with what Paul &s;aid in the foregoing chap. and manife&s;ts a natural and ea&s;y &s;en&s;e, agreeable to the Apo&s;tles account of their preach|ing and planting churches, who can he&s;itate to embrace it?</P>
<P>Hence it is evident, we mu&s;t under&s;tand the word, baptized, in the 13th ver&s;e of the xiith chap. con&s;i&s;tent with what Paul &s;aid in the xith chapter foregoing. And whereas the Friends, with B. think &s;aid text is &s;o much to their purpo&s;e; and a number of other denomations &s;eem to be in the dark re&s;pecting its meaning; I will endeavour to &s;hew, agreeably to the con|text that there is a two fold &s;en&s;e that may be con|&s;idered con&s;i&s;tent with the text and context, and coincides with the foregoing chap. xi, with the whole of the Apo&s;tolic account of the bapti&s;m both of water and of the Holy Gho&s;t and fire; and exactly agrees with Shepard's po&s;ition. It is evident that Paul, in &s;peaking of the &s;piritual gifts, in his introduction of &s;aid xiith chap. be|gins with the lea&s;t common mea&s;ure of the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, common to every true be|liever that has a mu&s;tard &s;eed grain of true &s;aith; when he &s;ays, ver&s;e 3, no man can &s;ay that Je&s;us is the Lord, but by the Holy Gho&s;t. If we con&s;ider the Apo&s;tle in the 13th ver&s;e as
<PB N="31" REF="027695_0030_0FD5E1CE1AD66C20">
refering to the common mea&s;ures, or gifts of the &s;pirit, in calling and confe&s;&s;ing Je&s;us to be Lord, which confe&s;&s;ion the Apo&s;tles required of every one they baptized with water; then there is an ea&s;y and &s;criptural &s;en&s;e, the text may be under&s;tood to mean, if we do but recol|lect.</P>
<P>The &s;criptures &s;peak of the &s;pirit of council, I&s;a. xi. 2. of the &s;pirit of grace, Zech. xii. 10. of the &s;pirit of Faith. 2 Cor. iv. chap. 13. we having the &s;ame &s;pirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I &s;pok|en: we al&s;o believe, and therefore &s;peak the &s;ame &s;pirit of faith by which David &s;pake, P&s;a. cxvi. Paul &s;ays they &s;pake this &s;ame &s;pirit of faith, &s;o much &s;poken of from the time that Abel thereby found acceptance with God, to the la&s;t accounts in the new-te&s;tament. This &s;ame &s;pirit of faith, by which Enoch walked with God, and Noah was &s;aved from the flood; by which Abraham offered up I&s;aac, and Mo&s;es for&s;ook Egypt; by which David, Samuel and all the Prophets manife&s;ted their obedience to the commands of God. All the new-te&s;tament &s;aints &s;poken of, were ju&s;tified from all things they could not be ju&s;tified by the law of Mo&s;es. By which the Corinthian Gentiles were turned from their Idolatries, to obey the go&s;pel preached by Paul; and by which Jews and Gen|tiles, bond and free, that were made partakers of this one &s;pirit, of faith, were brought into fellow&s;hip with the Father, with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and with one another, and willingly &s;ubjected them&s;elves to one and the &s;ame vi&s;ible order of
<PB N="32" REF="027695_0031_0FD5E1CE2282A3F8">
Chri&s;t's hou&s;e, as enjoined by the Apo&s;tles. By this one &s;pirit of faith, I under&s;tand they who were made partakers of it and confe&s;&s;ed Je&s;us to be Lord, were baptized in water into one vi&s;ible body, as brethren, and did through the vi&s;ible cup that Paul ble&s;&s;ed, and told the Co|rinthians was the communion of the blood of Chri&s;t, drink into one &s;pirit of love; for this &s;pirit of faith works by love and purifies the heart. I mean as many as &s;tood right, for they are the per&s;ons Paul di&s;cribes. This &s;en&s;e &s;tands agreeable to the whole account, given of the fir&s;t planting of the Corinthian church, and &s;hews con&s;i&s;tency with Paul's prai&s;ing the or|derly brethren, for keeping the ordinances as he delivered them under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Secondly, If we con&s;ider the 13 ver&s;e to refer to the miraculous gift of the holy Gho&s;t bapti&s;m, &s;peaking with tongues, &amp;c. which Jews and Parthians, Medes and Elamites, bond and free were baptized with, at Jeru&s;alem, and the Gen|tiles at the hou&s;e of Cornelius: with many of the fir&s;t converts in different places, upon the fir&s;t &s;preading of the go&s;pel; it abundantly proves Shepard's po&s;ition and &s;hews Brown's mi&s;take, in holding it the one bapti&s;m which remains to the chri&s;tians, to the end of the world. For we know of no &s;uch bapti&s;m, &s;ince miracles have cea&s;ed in the church. Neither can any man upon earth, however holy and humble, &s;hew he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of what the new-te&s;tament calls the Holy Gho&s;t bap|ti&s;m, any more than a man pretending to have the gift of miracles in our day: but cannot
<PB N="33" REF="027695_0032_0FD5E1CFEBFCE510">
prove it by working any wonder, in healing the &s;ick or any thing el&s;e. This bapti&s;m with other miraculous gifts of the &s;pirit have long cea&s;ed. But the faith by which we can call Je|&s;us the Lord, with hope and charity abideth with chri&s;tians, to the end of the world: as Paul informs us in the next chap. xiii. of the &s;ame Epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>But to hold it to be the bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t, and that all true chri&s;tians experience it, and that the outward ordinances are null and void, as friend B. under&s;tands it, is &s;uch a plain contradiction, and manife&s;t incon&s;i&s;tency, that I conceive it is impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile his &s;en&s;e of it, with the foregoing chap. xi. re&s;pecting the outward ordinances Paul had enjoined upon them by revelation from the Lord, allowing he &s;pake the truth. If friend B. can reconcile the&s;e incon&s;i&s;tencies, by a fair compari&s;on of &s;criptures, let it be made manife&s;t for my help and others. Until &s;ome further light appears from the revealed word of in&s;piration, and from the &s;pirit of God, opening up the word (for I hold the &s;pirit never teacheth contrary to the revealed word) it mu&s;t appear to every unpre|judiced, under&s;tanding per&s;on, by what Paul has declared, that he had it from the Lord to de|liver outward ordinances to the Gentiles, to whom God &s;ent him, when he had in&s;trument|ally turned them from darkne&s;s to light, and they had become obedient to his directions.</P>
<P>Thus I have offered my opinion, with my &s;criptural rea&s;ons for holding it to be the duty of believers in the&s;e days, to be baptized in wa|ter,
<PB N="34" REF="027695_0033_0FD5E1D16DE63E80">
and to remain &s;tedfa&s;t in the Apo&s;tles doc|trine, in fellow&s;hip, and breaking of bread, and prayers, according to the directions of the Apo&s;|tles. And I conceive it mu&s;t appear to every reader who is not bia&s;ed with prejudice, that there is a con&s;i&s;tent line in the manner of my expounding the &s;everal texts which friend B. under&s;tands makes again&s;t me, in re&s;pect of or|dinances. I have, by a number of expre&s;s texts, proved the un&s;criptural ab&s;urdity of holding a middle di&s;pen&s;ation, or con&s;idering John Bap|ti&s;t as a Law giver. I have &s;hewn a clear &s;crip|tural di&s;tinction between faith, holine&s;s, humil|ity, &amp;c. and the bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t and fire. And I conceive it appears con&s;i&s;tent up|on the whole, that I have &s;aid that there is one Lord, viz. Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great object of faith. There is one faith which I have de&s;cribed my ideas of, by which, as many as partook of it were made willing to &s;ubmit to the laws of the new-te&s;tament, as &s;oon as made known to them.&mdash; And there is one bapti&s;m recorded in the new-te&s;tament, viz. water bapti&s;m, that the Apo&s;tles enjoined upon &s;uch, and only &s;uch as profe&s;&s;ed to have the one faith, in the one Lord Je&s;us.</P>
<P>The view of the Apo&s;tles account, as I have con&s;idered it, runs con&s;i&s;tent in their planting of go&s;pel churches, both at Jeru&s;alem and among the Gentiles, as far as the new-te&s;tament gives us a particular account. Therefore as I believe they were endowed with the bapti&s;m of the Ho|ly Gho&s;t, the power from on high, to guide them into all the truth nece&s;&s;ary to teach believ|ers in all nations what to believe, and what to
<PB N="35" REF="027695_0034_0FD5E1D336645CB8">
practice; I find that they, in &s;ub&s;tance, taught nothing but what Mo&s;es and the Prophets &s;aid &s;hould come Therefore I am bound to regard the law and te&s;timony, according to the light given me by the &s;pirit: and if any man &s;peaks contrary to the plain, con&s;i&s;tent line of the in|&s;pired witne&s;&s;es, &s;o far I mu&s;t hold him in an error; rather than take up with the fine&s;t mi&s;ti|cal rea&s;oning of any man, &s;uppo&s;ing him&s;elf fa|voured with more &s;piritual light than &s;ome of the en&s;pired Apo&s;tles; and at the &s;ame time is obliged, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h his own opinion concerning new-te&s;tament ordinances, to con|clude &s;ome of the Apo&s;tles, who were mo&s;t ble&s;&s;|ed in converting &s;ouls, were in an error in di|recting their converts what to do, &amp;c. As for in&s;tance, Peter, if friend Brown's ideas are ju&s;t, was in a mi&s;take in his directions (although he had been preaching the mo&s;t powerful go&s;pel &s;ermon, as to its effects, that we ever heard of, and under the influence of the Holy Gho&s;t,) when he bid the 3000 repent and be baptized for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins. Acts ii. 38. This friend B. holds was an error, if I under&s;tand him. &mdash; Philip, although &s;ent by the &s;pirit to join the Eunuch's chariot, Acts viii. 29. and directed by an Angel how to find him, ver. 26. Immediate|ly upon the Eunuch's conver&s;ion, and a&s;king what hindred his being baptized, Philip told him if he believed with all his heart Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t, he might be baptized in that certain water. This was an error according to friend Brown's opinion; likewi&s;e his baptizing both men and women who received the word at Sa|maria,
<PB N="36" REF="027695_0035_0FD5E1DE94FB8948">
was another error. Peter, according to B. and his friends' opinion, made a greater blunder, and his error &s;eemed to be more aggra|vated at the hou&s;e of Cornelius, Acts x. than at Jeru&s;alem, Acts ii. For after they that heard his word were baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t; Peter, doubtle&s;s, fearing an objection from his Jewi&s;h brethren that attended him from Joppa, becau&s;e the new converts were uncircumci&s;ed Gentiles, &s;aid, can any forbid water that the&s;e &s;hould not be baptized which have received the Holy Gho&s;t as well as we? And he commands them to be baptized, &amp;c. by water bapti&s;m.&mdash; This was, in Brown's opinion, another error.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, reader, the great difference between Brown's rea&s;onings and Peter's. B. &s;ays the Ho|ly Gho&s;t bapti&s;m is the only bapti&s;m under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, and that water never was a duty under &s;aid di&s;pen&s;ation. Peter rea&s;ons in perfect contra&s;t to B. and commanded obedi|ence by being baptized in water, for the very rea&s;on that B. thinks they ought not. So the reader mu&s;t judge which is in the mi&s;take, the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle or friend Brown.</P>
<P>Thus, &s;ome of the Apo&s;tles, who were the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed, and owned by God in converting of &s;ouls and planting of go&s;pel churches; ac|cording to friend Brown's opinion, went blun|dering about among the nations directing &s;ome of their converts to do wrong, viz. in being bap|tized in water; and commanding others to do that which friend B. holds was not right to be done under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. If I un|der&s;tand him: &s;o the reader mu&s;t judge for him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="027695_0036_0FD5E1E150025F98">I would further ob&s;erve, our Lord informs his Apo&s;tles, that the &s;pirit of truth would guide them into all truth, John xvi. In the 1&s;t epi&s;tle of John iv. it is written, we, (viz. the Apo&s;tles) are of God, he that knoweth God heareth us, &amp;c.&mdash; The Apo&s;tle Paul, &s;ays, Heb. xiii. 7. Remember them which have the rule over you, &amp;c. viz. your guides the Apo&s;tles. It is evident from the&s;e texts, that chri&s;tians had no rule of faith and wor&s;hip in the Apo&s;tolic age, be&s;ide that which they received from our Lord and his in|&s;pired witne&s;&s;es. Which rule is tran&s;mitted to us in the writings of the new-te&s;tament, and is &s;ufficient now for the regulation of the church|es of Chri&s;t; if it was then. If any further light and regulations had been nece&s;&s;ary, to in|form us what to believe, or what to do upon our believing; I conceive, it will follow of un|deniable con&s;equence; that neither our Lord who gave him&s;elf for the church, nor the Apo&s;|tles who lived and died in the &s;ervice of it, have fully taken care to in&s;truct churches re&s;pecting duty, but have left their work as it were to the halves, and left others to fini&s;h and perfect it; or rather that we have no certain rule at all.&mdash; To clo&s;e, in a word, I would have my brethren retaliate friend Brown's kindne&s;s, in &s;ending me one of his books. I never &s;aw his face in the fle&s;h, nor is it likely I ever &s;hall, but I can heartily &s;ay, I wi&s;h him and all my antagoni&s;ts, a part of that eternal &s;alvation, which I hope through grace to partake of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>When I enter my clo&s;et and have &s;hut my door, I can repeat my reque&s;t, to him who &s;eeth
