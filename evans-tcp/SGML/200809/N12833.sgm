<P>IN the peru&s;al of the following pages thou wilt receive a pious man's plain account of his beginning in the weighty work of re|ligion, and his progre&s;s in a life devoted to promote the cau&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the real happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>Having experienced the Spiritual bapti&s;m which is e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation, and abiding in a &s;tate of watchfulne&s;s and humility, he became, under the Lord's Anointing, a well qualified in&s;trument for the in&s;truction and edification of others in the way of God|line&s;s, and by attending to the gift of Go&s;pel mini&s;try committed to his tru&s;t, and per|forming the duties required of him, he wit|ne&s;&s;ed a growth from &s;tature to &s;tature, and attained to be an upright elder and father in the church, <HI>being an example to the believers in word in conver&s;ation, in &s;pirit, in faith, and charity.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>His early &s;en&s;e of the impre&s;&s;ions of divine love, and &s;piritual conflicts in his youth.&mdash;Death of his fa|ther&mdash;His marriage&mdash;The &s;ettlement of a monthly meeting at Nottingham&mdash;His joining with other friends in vi&s;iting of families the fir&s;t and &s;econd time&mdash;His being appointed an Elder, and fir&s;t ap|pearance in the mini&s;try, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Was born in the Town&s;hip of Nottingham, in the County of Che&s;ter, and Province of Penn&s;ylvania, on the Fourth Day of the Sixth Month, 1705, and was tenderly brought up in profe&s;&s;ion of the Truth by my parents, JOHN and HANNAH CHURCHMAN, who were diligent atten|ders of Religious Meetings, both on the fir&s;t, and other days of the week, and encouragers of their children in that practice, which is certainly a duty

in parents &s;o to do, and often owned by the reaches of Divine Love, even to tho&s;e who are very young in years, of which I am a living Witne&s;s; for tho' I early felt reproof for bad words and actions, yet knew not whence it came, until about the age of eight years, as I &s;at in a &s;mall meeting, the Lord by the reaches of his heavenly love, and goodne&s;s, &s;o overcame and tendered my heart, and by his glorious light di&s;covered to me the knowledge of him&s;elf, that I &s;aw my&s;elf, and what I had been doing, and what it was which had re|proved me for evil, and was made in the &s;ecret of my heart to confe&s;s that, childhood and youth, and the fooli&s;h actions and words, to which they are propen&s;e, are truly vanity; yet ble&s;&s;ed for ever be the name of the Lord! who in his infinite mercy and goodne&s;s clearly informed me, that if I would mind the di&s;coveries of his Truth, and pure Light for the future, what I had done in the time of my ignorance, he would wink at and for|give; and Oh! the &s;tream of Love which filled my heart with &s;olid Joy at that time, and la&s;ted for many days, is beyond all expre&s;&s;ion; indeed I was early taught to think different from &s;uch who hold the perdition of infants, and am &s;ince con|firmed in fully believing that the &s;in of our fir&s;t parents is not imputed to us, (tho' as their off|&s;pring we are by nature prone to evil, which brings wrath) until by the di&s;covery of light and grace, we are taught to di&s;tingui&s;h between good and evil, and in the &s;eed and inward principle that &s;heweth the evil, we feel the enmity placed again&s;t the evil, and the author thereof, the devil, or wicked one; if we afterwards commit tho&s;e things which we &s;aw to be evil, we then fall under condemnation, and wrath, and here every &s;oul that &s;ins mu&s;t die to the &s;in he hath committed, and witne&s;s the being

rai&s;ed again by the power of God, into newne&s;s of life in CHRIST JESUS, not to live to him&s;elf, to fulfil the will of the fle&s;h; but to live unto him, who died to take away &s;in.</P>
<P>I may not forget to relate this one thing; my father &s;ent me about three miles on an errand; I rode a mare which had a colt perhaps half a year old; on my return home, the colt ran-away from the mare to a company of wild hor&s;es, which were feeding not far from the path I was in, &s;o I went home without the colt; my father a&s;ked me where the colt was, I told him where it went from me; he bid me go to the place with &s;peed, that it might follow the mare home; I went, and found the wild hor&s;es feeding on a piece of ground where the timber trees had been killed perhaps about two, or three years; but before I went among the dead trees, a mighty wind aro&s;e, which blew &s;ome down, and many limbs flew about; I &s;tood &s;till with my mind turned inward to the Lord, who I believed was able to pre&s;erve me from hurt; &s;o I pa&s;&s;ed among the trees without fear, &s;ave the fear of the Lord, which fills the hearts of his humble depend|ing children, with love that is &s;tronger than death; I found the colt, which readily followed the mare, and I returned home with great bowedne&s;s of heart, and thankfulne&s;s to the Lord, for his mercy and goodne&s;s to me on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was my practice when I went to bed, to exa|mine how I had &s;pent the pa&s;t day, and to endea|vour to feel the pre&s;ence of the Lord near, which I did for &s;ome con&s;iderable time prefer to all other things, and I found this practice a great help to &s;leep &s;weetly, and by long experience I can recommend it to children, and tho&s;e al&s;o of riper age.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e that no one living knew my condition; for I delighted to keep hidden, yet quick to ob&s;erve

the conduct of others; I remember that a per&s;on once at my father's who &s;pake about religious mat|ters with an affected tone, as if he was a good man; when he went away, I was near him, and when he mounted his hor&s;e, taking a di&s;like to &s;ome of his motions, he called him an ugly dumb bea&s;t, with &s;uch an accent, as be&s;pake great di&s;plea&s;ure, and grieved me much; for I did believe, that a man who&s;e mind was &s;weetened with divine love truly, would not &s;peak wrathfully, or diminutively, even of the bea&s;ts of the field, which were given to man for his u&s;e, he did not make them him&s;elf; I relate this in&s;tance, that it may be a warning to all, that they be careful of giving offence to the little ones.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding I had been favoured as before mentioned; yet as I grew in years, I was much given to play, and began to delight again in &s;everal things, for which I had before been reproved, and &s;till by the divine witne&s;s in my mind, was brought under judgment for; but having lo&s;t my innocence and covering of the pure ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit, I endea|voured through fear to fly from the voice of the holy &s;pirit in my own heart; the enemy per&s;uaded me, that I could never be re&s;tored to my former &s;tate, becau&s;e I had &s;inned again&s;t &s;o great know|ledge, or if I was, the judgment through which I mu&s;t pa&s;s, would be intolerable to bear, &s;o that I had better be chearful, and take my ea&s;e and de|light; but when I was about nine years old, my father &s;ent me to &s;chool to learn to read, (having been taught to know my letters, and &s;pell a little at home) in which I took great delight, and thereby diverted my&s;elf from feeling my pain of mind, for the great lo&s;s of my innocence which I had &s;u&s;tain|ed; and altho' the man, by whom I was taught, was poor, and &s;at in his loom, being a weaver, while the children read to him, I improved very

fa&s;t, and he &s;oon put me to writing, and finding my capacity full as ripe as is common in boys of that age, he began to teach me Arithmetic; yet gracious goodne&s;s &s;till favored me with conviction, and by his &s;pirit was witne&s;s again&s;t me, and in mercy the Lord vi&s;ited me with a &s;ore fit of &s;ick|ne&s;s, and by his rod of correction brought me a little more to my&s;elf; this was in the forepart of the winter, when I was between nine, and ten years of age, and being pretty well recovered for &s;ome weeks, I had in the following &s;pring a relap&s;e of the &s;ame di&s;order, (the pleuri&s;y) in which, by out|ward correction with &s;ickne&s;s, and inward judg|ment, he was plea&s;ed to draw me to him&s;elf, which cau&s;ed me to renew my covenant with him, and I did hope never more to &s;tray from him, to follow lying vanities, who&s;e &s;weets I had experienced to be bitter, yea exceeding bitterne&s;s in the end. I had taken great delight from a child to play with whi&s;|tles, and pipes, made of the bark of &s;mall branches of trees, and of &s;traws of wheat and rye; but now it grieved me to ob&s;erve children delight therein, and I ventured to tell my mind to &s;ome of them concerning &s;uch things</P>
<P>Man is di&s;tingui&s;hed from other creatures not only by his voice; but by varying the breath toge|ther with the orderly motion of tongue and lips; that voice is made to convey the ideas of the mind, and thoughts of the heart to his fellow-creatures, and as he was created to glorify his maker, the end and intention of his voice &s;hould be directed to promote his glory among men; whether in things natural, or &s;piritual, that is of this life, or that to come; mu&s;ic as now commonly u&s;ed, and whi&s;tling and &s;inging, have no &s;uch tendency; but are rather diver&s;ions of the mind from what it ought to be employed about, and therefore a ba&s;e com&s;umption

of precious time, which man mu&s;t be accountable for, which if enough regarded, in&s;tead of mu&s;ic, whi&s;tling, and &s;inging merry, fooli&s;h, and prophane &s;ongs, many would have occa&s;ion to lament and weep for their mi&s;pent time. I leave it as a caution to parents, to beware of indulging their dear chil|dren in any thing, which may impre&s;s their tender minds with a de&s;ire after mu&s;ic, or &s;uch diver&s;ion when they grow in years; but that in&s;tead thereof, by living in the pure fear of the Lord, and near the &s;pirit of truth in their own hearts, they may be furni&s;hed with example, and precept to direct the minds of their offspring, to attend to the voice of him who called to Samuel in days of old, and re|mains to be the &s;ame teacher to his people in this age; may his holy name be magnifyed for ever, and ever!</P>
<P>I retained my care, and circum&s;pection for &s;ome time; but through unwatchfulne&s;s, and a de&s;ire for play which led into lightne&s;s, and forgetfulne&s;s, I lo&s;t this &s;tate before I was twelve years of age, and tho' the Lord was near, and followed me by his reproof, in order to bring me under judgment, I fled from it as much as I could; having let in a belief, that as I had been favoured to ta&s;te in &s;o wonderful a manner, "of the good word of Life, and power of the world to come, and had &s;o &s;hamefully fallen away, there remained for me, no more &s;acrifice for &s;in; but a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation," which as I thought &s;eemed to burn in me to that degree, that I was afraid to be alone, for it &s;eemed to be loudly proclaimed in me, that whether I eat, or drank, waked, or &s;lept I was accur&s;ed, and when alone I abhorred my&s;elf; but when in company u&s;ed my utmo&s;t endeavors to hide my condition, by being chearful and arch in my di&s;cour&s;e, and was thought by mo&s;t young people to

have a knack as they called it, at je&s;ting and witty turns; yet even in this time, I entertained &s;uch a value for religion, that I was not willing to reveal my &s;ituation; le&s;t I &s;hould be a reproach thereto, or di&s;courage others from &s;eeking happine&s;s; but when night came, and I went to bed, no tongue can expre&s;s the angui&s;h I felt, afraid to lay awake, and afraid to de&s;ire &s;leep, le&s;t I &s;hould be cut off from the land of the living, and my portion appoint|ed in utter darkne&s;s; I &s;o far neglected my learn|ing, that when about thirteen years old, I could not read but in a poor manner, tho' once noted to be a ready reader; I was not willing that good friends &s;hould take notice of me, or look me &s;tea|dily in the face; for I thought they would di&s;cern my wickedne&s;s, and it would be a trouble to them, or by their reproving me, add to my di&s;tre&s;s; I &s;eemed to be left without any power to re&s;i&s;t what I knew to be evil, and being a&s;hamed that I had &s;o lo&s;t my little learning, I &s;ought to divert my&s;elf by endeavouring to regain it; my former genius, and delight &s;o returned, that when I was about fifteen years of age, I had made great improvement, not only in reading, but in writing, and arithmetick, and &s;everal branches of the mathematicks, and be|gan to value my&s;elf in &s;ome degree thereon, and &s;o got over the convictions of the divine witne&s;s, which &s;poke trouble in me; neverthele&s;s during this time I kept clo&s;e in attending meetings, hoping at &s;ea&s;ons, that perhaps the Lord would conde&s;cend once more to vi&s;it me; for a &s;aying of an eminent pious man was revived in my remembrance
<Q>That if there remained a de&s;ire in the heart after Re|demption, as it was kept to, the Lord would again a&s;&s;uredly vi&s;it &s;uch in his own time.</Q>
So that I was fearful of neglecting meetings, if my parents had not forwarded me, le&s;t I might mi&s;s of
<PB N="8" REF="016223_0014_0F9BD43E82DECD60">
the good intended for me; yet the &s;ubtle working of the power of darkne&s;s was at times very great, &s;ugge&s;ting to me that all things came by nature, and that there was no God, no heaven, no devil; no puni&s;hment for evil, religion a je&s;t, and painful care about futurity a &s;illy whim, propagated to de|prive people of plea&s;ure; but ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord! he pre&s;erved me from that &s;nare, for while I felt his judgment for &s;in, I believed in his Being, and holine&s;s, and I am indeed fully of the mind, that no man can be an Athei&s;t before he acts contrary to knowledge, when to allay the horror, and an|gui&s;h of mind, he feels for the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, he clo&s;es in with this temptation. At other times, the &s;ame &s;ubtle power would tempt me to di&s;pair of mercy, which if given way to, would lead to di&s;traction; but the hand of the Lord was under|neath, tho' for my di&s;obedience he &s;uffered me to remain in the wilderne&s;s, and to dwell among fiery &s;erpents, until he had wa&s;ted that in me, which lu&s;ted after forbidden things.</P>

<P>I had &s;trong de&s;ires that elderly friends &s;hould be good examples to the youth, not only in word, and conver&s;ation, but in meetings for the wor&s;hip of God, and it grieved me exceedingly to &s;ee any of them overcome with &s;leep, and my concern for one friend on that account, was &s;o great, that I knew not what was be&s;t to do, and rea&s;oned after this manner, Lord! thou knowe&s;t that I am young, and he an elderly man, he will not take it well, that I &s;hould &s;peak to him, and perhaps I may yet fall; and if &s;o the more I take upon me, the greater my fall will be; be&s;ides, tho' I have &s;poken in meetings for di&s;cipline, when truth hath been &s;trong upon me, yet out of meetings, I am not fit to reprove, or &s;peak to particulars: For I was cautious indeed in tho&s;e days, of talking about religion, or good things, from a fear of getting a habit thereof, and &s;o not know the true motion; which I thought I had ob&s;erved to be the failing of &s;ome. In this &s;treight it came into my mind to go to the per&s;on in the night, as the mo&s;t private time, and manner; for if I took him a&s;ide before, or after a meeting, others might wonder for what, and I might betray my weakne&s;s, and reproach the good cau&s;e, and do no good, and if the friend &s;hould be di&s;plea&s;ed with me, he might publicly &s;hew, what otherwi&s;e he would conceal after a private deliberation; &s;o in the evening I went, de&s;iring the Lord to go with me, and guide me, if it was a motion from him; when I came to the hou&s;e it was dark, I cal|led,

<P>When I had entered the twenty fifth year of my age, I accompli&s;hed marriage with Margaret Brown a virtuous young woman, whom I had loved as a &s;i&s;ter for &s;everal years, becau&s;e I believed &s;he loved religion; I think I may &s;ay &s;afely, it was in a good degree of the Lord's pure fear, and a &s;en&s;e of the pointings of truth, on both &s;ides, that we took each other on the 27<HI>th</HI> day of the eleventh month 1729, (old &s;tile) in an appointed meeting at Ea&s;t Notting|ham, and I thought that our Heavenly Father owned us with his pre&s;ence at that time.

<P>The Summer following, in the year 1730, a Monthly-meeting was &s;ettled at Nottingham, (being before a branch of New-Garden monthly-meeting) by the advice, and appointment of the quarterly-meeting; this brought a fear, and weighty concern upon me, and many others, that the affairs of Truth might be managed to the honour thereof; for we had but few &s;ub&s;tantial elderly friends. In a &s;en&s;e of our weakne&s;s, it was the breathing de&s;ire of my &s;oul, that the Lord would be plea&s;ed for his own &s;ake, and the honour of his great Name, to be near to his children, and in&s;pire them with wi&s;dom, and judgment for his own work; and ble&s;&s;ed forever be his holy Name! I believe he heard our cry, and in mea&s;ure an&s;wered our prayers; being kept low, and humble, it was a growing time to &s;everal. My af|fection to friends of New-Garden monthly-meeting was &s;o great, that for many months after we parted from them, I &s;eldom mi&s;&s;ed attending it, and there|in had great &s;atisfaction, and &s;ome of their members frequently attended ours, for our love towards each other was mutual.</P>
<P>When I was about twenty-&s;ix years of age, &s;ome friends were appointed to perform a family vi&s;it, and being de&s;irous of my company, I joined with them, and therein felt the ownings of Truth in &s;ome de|gree; but notwith&s;tanding I &s;aw at times the &s;tates of families, and particulars, yet not in &s;o clear a manner as I thought nece&s;&s;ary to become my duty to open my mouth in the &s;ervice, &s;ave now and then, in a private way to particulars, of which none knew except tho&s;e to whom I &s;pake. At one hou&s;e the friends on the &s;ervice had a good opportunity, &s;eve|ral

<P>When this vi&s;it was over, I kept much at home, yet was careful to attend meetings on the fir&s;t and other days of the week, and found work enough to watch again&s;t a lukewarm, indolent Spirit, which would come over me when I &s;at down to wait upon God; tho' I came to the meeting in a lively warm en|gagement of mind, I found the warfare again&s;t luke|warmne&s;s, &s;leepine&s;s, and a roving mind, mu&s;t be &s;teadily maintained, and if none of the&s;e hinder|ances were given way to, the Lord when he had proved his children, would ari&s;e for their help, and &s;catter his and their enemies, which my &s;oul ex|perienced many times beyond expre&s;&s;ion: The Lord alone is all-powerful, and worthy to be waited upon and wor&s;hipped in humility and reverent adora|tion of &s;oul for ever.

<P>The love of truth, I believe it was, and a de&s;ire that the di&s;cipline, and good order of the church

might be maintained, made me willing to take con|&s;iderable pains to attend neighbouring monthly meetings, which I think was a ble&s;&s;ing to me in &s;ome good degree, being thereby often in&s;tructed; and I have often admired at the &s;lackne&s;s of &s;ome, that &s;uffer trifling things to keep them from their meetings for wor&s;hip on week days, and fir&s;t days; for tho' curio&s;ity brings &s;uch to monthly meetings, they are &s;eldom of any real &s;ervice when they come, not being &s;en&s;ible of that pure Divine Love, in which the Church through its &s;everal members edi|fieth it&s;elf, and as any one becomes truly &s;en&s;ible thereof, they will delight to wait upon God, with their brethren and &s;i&s;ters, who is the fountain of pure Love, and &s;o fills the hearts of his humble, depending children therewith, that by it, they are known to be his Di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>In the year 1731, our antient and worthy friend William Brown, who had been in the &s;tation of an elder many years, growing feeble, and incapable to to attend the Quarterly-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, Friends of our particular meeting propo&s;ed me to the Monthly-meeting for that &s;ervice, which brought a clo&s;e exerci&s;e upon me, con&s;idering my|&s;elf a youth, and the weight of the &s;ervice; but after a &s;olid con&s;ideration, I found mo&s;t peace in &s;ubmitting to the meeting, with fervent inward de|&s;ires, that the Lord would be plea&s;ed to be with me therein, to pre&s;erve me from acting, or judging in my own will and &s;pirit, knowing that the &s;ervice could not be performed but by wi&s;dom, under&s;tand|ing, and ability from him; when I attended tho&s;e large and weighty meetings of mini&s;ters and el|ders, the care and fear that was upon me is not ea&s;ily expre&s;&s;ed; and may I never forget the graci|ous conde&s;cen&s;ion of kind providence, who was plea&s;ed to own me, by the &s;hedding abroad of his love in my heart, that I verily thought, they re|&s;embled

the &s;chool of the prophets, the High Prie&s;t, great Prophet, and Bi&s;hop of Souls, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t being pre&s;ident among them.</P>
<P>An apprehen&s;ion that I &s;hould be called to the mini&s;try, and a concern on that account, had been, at times, for &s;everal years, weightily on my mind; but I now again thought I was mi&s;taken in that be|lief, and that it was only a preparative to qualify me for the &s;tation of an elder, and thereby my exerci&s;e became &s;omewhat lighter for a time; the tenderne&s;s and love I felt to tho&s;e engaged in pub|lic mini&s;try, was very great, and I believe I was made helpful to &s;ome by giving private hints, when and to whom I thought there was occa&s;ion, in plain|ne&s;s, &s;implicity and fear, which often afforded in|&s;truction to my&s;elf as well as to them.</P>
<P>In 1733, I accompanied friends on another vi&s;it to families, wherein, at times, I felt the opening of truth in the love of it, and a few words to &s;peak to the &s;tates of &s;ome, tho' in great fear, le&s;t I &s;hould put my hand to that weighty work without the real requiring of duty; and at one family, on a morning pretty early, being the fir&s;t we went to on that day, I thought it would be better for the whole family, in a religious &s;en&s;e, if the heads of it were more zealous in attending meetings: I &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of being examples to children and &s;ervants, by a careful attendance of meetings for wor&s;hip on the fir&s;t, and other days of the week; but I was &s;o weak and poor, that I doubted whether it was my duty to mention any thing thereof to them, &s;o con|cluded to omit it; by which I hoped to judge of what I had been about before, and &s;o grew ea&s;y in my mind, and as we were on the way to the next hou&s;e, I began to judge, that I had no real bu&s;ine&s;s to have &s;aid any thing at any hou&s;e; and having for|borne in my own will, I was now left to my own judgment for a time, At the next hou&s;e, friends were

<P>I continued in the &s;tation of an Elder, and &s;ome times delivered a few &s;entences in public Te&s;timony, which occa&s;ioned me to apprehend I &s;hould not be in my proper place, except I reque&s;ted to be relea&s;ed from my elder&s;hip; after a time of weighty con&s;i|deration, I mode&s;tly reque&s;ted, that friends would con&s;ider my ca&s;e, for in&s;tead of taking care of the mini&s;try of others, I &s;tood in need of the care of others, and that it would be relieving to my mind, if they would nominate an elder in my room, which was taken into con&s;ideration for a time; friends waiting I &s;uppo&s;e to &s;ee what proof I &s;hould make of my mini&s;try. I attended the winter quarterly meet|ing of mini&s;ters and elders, and had to give an ac|count of the mini&s;try at our meeting, the elders being called to an&s;wer one after another in order, according to the &s;ettlement of the meetings they belonged to, a fear &s;truck me le&s;t a form of words was too much in general ob&s;erved, particularly, "that the mini&s;try was well received." When my turn came, I could not be ea&s;y without varying that part, and in&s;tead of &s;aying, the mini&s;try of the mini&s;ters is well received, I &s;aid, that I believed the mini&s;try of the public friends was generally approved of, and added, that I did wi&s;h, that the mini&s;try of all the mini&s;tring friends was better received than I conceived it was; whereupon I was a&s;ked, what I meant, and under the weight I felt on my mind, I replied, it was not from a thought of bear|ing hard on the &s;ervice of the public friends; but from the difference between approving thereof, be|cause they believed it to be right, and attending no

further, which would not do the work, but to put in practice what they heard recommended, was on|ly well receiving of it, and if that was really the ca&s;e, our &s;ociety would appear more beautiful than at pre&s;ent; thus the matter clo&s;ed, and I had peace in the remark. I think this was the la&s;t meeting I attended as an elder; before the next quarterly meeting in the &s;econd month 1734, another was recommended in my place.</P>
<P>About this time as I &s;at in one of our own meet|ings, I felt a flow of affection to the people, for many not of our &s;ociety came there, perhaps out of curi|o&s;ity, &s;everal young mini&s;ters having come forth in public te&s;timony, in which extraordinary flow of af|fection, I had a very bright opening as I thought, and expected to &s;tand up with it very &s;oon, but be|ing willing to weigh it carefully was not very forward, viewing its decrea&s;ing brightne&s;s, until &s;omething &s;aid as it were within me, "is the woe in it," is nece&s;&s;ity laid upon thee, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ix. 16. And there|fore woe if thou preach not the go&s;pel. This put me to a &s;tand, and made me feel after the living pre&s;ence of him, in who&s;e name and power I de&s;ired to &s;peak, if I appeared in te&s;timony; and not feeling the pure life and power of Truth, &s;o as to &s;tand up, the brightne&s;s of the Vi&s;ion faded, and left me quiet, humble, and thankful for this pre&s;ervation; the drawing &s;trength and lu&s;ting de&s;ire of the un|&s;table, who centre not to the pure gift in them|&s;elves, are as the many waters, or &s;ea of My&s;tery Babylon, for her merchants to &s;ail their &s;hips and trade upon. This was a time of inward growing to me, the welfare of the churches was &s;trongly de|&s;ired, and the extendings of the love of the Hea|venly Father, I felt at times to reach over &s;ea and land, to my great admiration; but however my heart was enlarged, I believed it was my duty to re|tire inward, and wait with patience until my friends

<P>In the winter 1735-6, William Brown my brother in law, my &s;i&s;ter Dinah Brown (then a widow,) and my&s;elf, were all recommended to the meeting of Mini&s;ters and Elders, as mini&s;ters, and at this meeting I let a certain friend know, that for &s;ome|time I had a de&s;ire to vi&s;it friends at Newtown, Mid|dletown, Go&s;hen, Caln, and Bradford meetings, hop|ing that he would go with me, for without &s;ome &s;uitable companion I was not ea&s;y to go, becau&s;e it would be nece&s;&s;ary, that notice &s;hould be given to an&s;wer the end of a vi&s;it, which he al&s;o thought nece&s;&s;ary, and let me know that he would take the needful care, which I &s;uppo&s;ed was previou&s;ly to inform &s;ome friends of each meeting, in order that they might acquaint their neighbours if they had freedom, and I was ea&s;y, not knowing but he would bear me company: On third day I was at the gene|ral meeting of wor&s;hip held at Providence, and at the breaking up thereof, the friend whom I had &s;poken to, &s;tood up and gave public notice, that I intended to &s;it with friends at the meetings afore&s;aid, and named the days in order, and reque&s;ted friends would take proper care to give notice; at which I was exceedingly &s;urprized, and repented that I had &s;poken thereof; I would have gladly ran home but for fear of bringing a reproach, and to me it &s;eemed likely it would be the ca&s;e if I pur&s;ued the tract laid out for me; in this &s;trait I was humbled even to weeping; a &s;ympathizing experienced friend came to me, and &s;pake affectionately, bidding me not to be ca&s;t down, for it was heard with gladne&s;s, that
<PB N="28" REF="016223_0034_0F9BD463D280D100">
it was in my heart to vi&s;it tho&s;e meetings, and that if I lived, and did well, I mu&s;t meet with greater trials. I &s;uppo&s;e friends of tho&s;e meetings knew more of me than I expected, for I had carefully at|tended meetings of di&s;cipline &s;everal years, and had been &s;ometimes active therein; the meetings were generally pretty full, and I believe truth owned my &s;ervice, which was to me great cau&s;e of thankful|ne&s;s. In this little journey friends were very kind to me, and I was afraid too free in manife&s;ting of it; indeed there are many indulgent nur&s;es, many for|ward in&s;tructors, but too few fathers in the church, who having been acquainted with him the great Al|pha in their tender beginning, and by dwelling in his holy coun&s;el and fear, have the care of the members at heart, and in the Wi&s;dom of Truth know how to in&s;truct, advi&s;e, and conduct them&s;elves towards &s;uch who are called to the Lord's work according to their &s;everal di&s;po&s;itions, growths, and gifts receiv|ed, in order that they might be pre&s;erved growing in and by him, the Alpha, experiencing him, their beginning, to be with them, and to be the Omega in their conclu&s;ion the Fir&s;t and the La&s;t, all in all, the Lord God over all, Ble&s;&s;ed in him&s;elf and the Son of his love, our holy high Prie&s;t and In&s;truc|tor. For want of proper caution herein, &s;ome have valued them&s;elves above what they ought, and thereby reduced their credit with others.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer following I felt a &s;ecret gentle draft to vi&s;it the meetings in the back parts of Che&s;|ter, Philadelphia and Bucks Counties, which con|tinuing with me, and my brother in law William Brown having the like concern, we acquainted friends at our monthly meeting, late in the fall of the year, and had their concurrence, and I believe their good wi&s;hes for us; &s;o in the tenth month 1736, we proceeded, and went to Go&s;hen, Radnor, and to a general meeting at Haverford, and to an
<PB N="29" REF="016223_0035_0F9BD464053B9598">
evening meeting at a &s;chool-hou&s;e in upper Merion, and over Schuylkill to Plymouth; we had good &s;atisfaction mo&s;tly. I could &s;ee that my brother grew in his gift, and after one of the meetings a wellmeaning friend told me, that I was a &s;eer, and knew the &s;tates of people better than they could inform me at which I felt &s;ome &s;ecret plea&s;ure, yet not without (as I thought) a humble fear, knowing that flattery or unguarded commendation, if li&s;tned to, is a kind of poi&s;on to young mini&s;ters, and &s;ometimes makes them &s;well beyond the proper &s;ize. At Plymouth, I had an open meeting, and it &s;eemed to me, as if what I had to &s;ay was re|ceived freely by the people, and after meeting I was filled with joy to &s;uch a degree, that I wept, and dropped behind my company, (to keep undi&s;cover|ed,) in our going to a friends hou&s;e, inwardly pray|ed that it might be taken from me, for I feared, that by the natural part in me, it was taken to ex|ce&s;s. Next day we had a &s;mall meeting in Job Pugh's hou&s;e, where I thought I &s;aw the &s;tates of particulars very clear, and had &s;omething to &s;ay, which perhaps I delivered in too &s;trong terms, con|&s;idering my age and experience in the mini&s;try; a becoming fear, and mode&s;ty in expre&s;&s;ion is very ornamental and &s;afe for mini&s;ters, both young and old; after meeting, we went home with Evan Evans to North Wales, who conver&s;ed but little with us, but was grave and &s;olid, and therein a good ex|ample to me; for &s;ometimes young mini&s;ters hurt them&s;elves by too much talking, and draw from others of like freedom, things not convenient for them to hear. The next day we were at North|wales meeting, which was large, being fir&s;t day, my brother W. B. appeared in the forepart and had good &s;ervice, afterwards I &s;tood up with a large and good opening as I thought, but found hard work and &s;oon &s;at down again without much relief,
<PB N="30" REF="016223_0036_0F9BD464C722E398">
which being a little unu&s;ual, I ventured to &s;tand up again, and with a zeal that exceeded my childi&s;h knowledge, laid on &s;ome &s;trokes with the &s;trength of the mans part more than with the hum|bling power of Truth; for if we deliver hard things to the people, we &s;hould ever remember, that we are fle&s;h and blood, and by nature &s;ubject to the &s;ame frailties; this would lead us clo&s;ely to attend to the power, and to mini&s;ter only in the ability of Truth, in the meekne&s;s, gentlene&s;s and wi&s;dom which it in&s;pires; I &s;oon &s;at down again, and in a moment felt my&s;elf left in great darkne&s;s, and friends broke up the meeting in a minute or two af|ter, which I &s;oon thought was rather unkind, as it &s;eemed to &s;hew a public di&s;like, when a private ad|monition, which I believed was my due, would have an&s;wered the end better; but when I knew they held an afternoon meeting, I judged that I had in|fringed on the time, and the weight of the trial &s;ettled &s;till deeper on my mind; in the afternoon I &s;ate &s;ilent, and was very much dejected, and my good friend Evan Evans, an experienced mini&s;ter and father in the church, bid me be &s;teady and in|ward, looking to the Lord who knew how to deal with his children, and gently correct, as well when they went too fa&s;t, as too &s;low; this fatherly ten|der hint fully opened my eyes; for before I was in &s;ome doubt wherein I had mi&s;&s;ed; I now believed he &s;aw I was too zealous and forward, and believed al&s;o that he had the judgment of Truth; this was enough for me; I abhorred my&s;elf, and was in great fear that I &s;hould not be forgiven. Another friend told me that I only felt an oppo&s;ing &s;pirit in &s;ome, who&s;e &s;tates had been remarkably &s;poken to by me, and de&s;ired me not to be too much ca&s;t down, for I had the mind of Truth; this in&s;tead of relieving, rather added to my affliction, for I &s;aw it would have a tendency, if heeded, to take me from under

the hand of the Lord, which was heavy upon me, and &s;omething in me &s;aid, "Let God be true and every man a lyar, keep to the witne&s;s in thine own heart, attend to the Spirit of Truth there, and mind its reproof:" Man through natural affection and &s;ympathy may err, and admini&s;ter fal&s;e in|&s;truction, but the other proceeds from the God of Truth. I would have given all that I had to have been at home, for I greatly feared that I &s;hould bring a reproach on the truth, the honour whereof was dear to me; I hid my di&s;tre&s;s as much as po&s;|&s;ible, and proceeded to attend meetings with my brother, whom I greatly preferrred, and was afraid to di&s;courage by my complaints.</P>
<P>We were at a meeting at Skippack, and at another at Perkioming or New-Providence, in each whereof I had &s;o much light and under&s;tanding as to offer a few words, but the &s;ervice lay chiefly on my bro|ther; from thence we went to Oley, where I had a few things to deliver in a friends hou&s;e in an even|ing &s;itting with his family, which was large; the friend in great tenderne&s;s ob&s;erved afterward, that revelation was not cea&s;ed, for their &s;tates were very exactly &s;poken to, at which I marvelled, for I was greatly reduced, and thought my&s;elf one of the poore&s;t and mo&s;t unqualified that ever travelled in that great &s;ervice, in which we were now engaged; this di&s;pen&s;ation though &s;orrowful to wade through, was very humbling and profitable for me, who per|haps but a little before was ready to think I knew &s;omething about preaching, but now knew nothing, that I might more fully under&s;tand that he who thinketh of him&s;elf "he knoweth any thing, kno|weth nothing as he ought to know," to wit, that all pure knowledge is &s;ealed up in him who is the Fountain of Wi&s;dom and Knowledge, to be only opened by him&s;elf to his dependant children, by the revelation of his own Spirit, when and to whom he plea&s;es.</P>

<P>From thence we went to Plum&s;tead in Bucks County; here I was rather more enlarged, and to Buckingham, Wrightstown, Falls, Middletown, Bri&s;tol, and over on the ice to Burlington in New-Jer&s;ey, the weather being exceeding cold, and came back again on the ice over Delaware the &s;ame even|ing to Bri&s;tol, and thence proceded to Byberry and Hor&s;ham meetings, and by this time I was relieved from the depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirit I felt before, yet was under a humble reverent fear, not forgetting the meeting at North Wales; I was in &s;ome degree again admitted to behold the lifting up of the Heavenly Fathers countenance, which makes the &s;olitary re|joice. From Hor&s;ham we went to a meeting ap|pointed at William Hallowell's, the company of the man who undertook to &s;hew us the way not being agreeable, we per&s;waded him to return, and &s;o were left not knowing the way to the hou&s;e, which made me very thoughtful, le&s;t we &s;hould mi&s;s our way, and friends would then be blamed for neglect of duty towards us; as I was thus pondering in my mind, a faith aro&s;e, that providence could direct, and that moment I beheld the track of a man who had cro&s;&s;ed the road we were in, and felt a &s;udden turn of mind to follow the &s;ame, which made me quite ea&s;y; it brought us to a field, where we found the fence down on both &s;ides, and led to the hou&s;e where friends were gathered, and we were not di&s;|covered to be without a guide, for which I was thankful, believing it to be the &s;ecret direction of kind providence, and not barely chance.

<P>Early this &s;pring (1737&punc;) the Lord was plea&s;ed to try me with poverty and inward want, which brought me into great &s;earchings of heart, and &s;e|cret enquiry into the cau&s;e, but could not under|&s;tand that I had wilfully di&s;obeyed, neither &s;tood convicted in my mind for doing ami&s;s, but my po|verty and inward want increa&s;ed, with di&s;tre&s;s and doubting to that degree, that I began to fear I had mi&s;taken, and took error for truth, and in my own imagination formed a religion, and for the rebelli|on of my youth was &s;uffered to go on until now; and all that ever I had done was brought into judg|ment and reduced to nothing, and the enemy en|deavoured to &s;tir me up to impatience, and to per|&s;uade

me, that my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions would never be forgiven; many days of &s;orrow and nights of &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s I pa&s;&s;ed through, and began to de&s;pair of ever beholding the Light of the Heavenly counte|nance lifted up towards me again.</P>
<P>Towards the la&s;t of the third month I went to Sad&s;bury, to &s;ettle a di&s;pute about the bounds of land and having &s;omething to do near Samuel Nutt's Iron works on French creek, as I was going thither being alone and my inward &s;orrow and di&s;tre&s;s very great, I thought I would now endeavour to vent it, were it but in mournful groans, and draw|ing in my breath in order to vent it in a groan, my inward angui&s;h &s;eemed to burn like fire, and I was in&s;tantly &s;taid from breaking forth, for I was per|&s;uaded my pa&s;&s;ion of grief if given way unto, would go beyond bounds, to the tearing of my cloaths, if no further, my heart not being tender, I could not weep, which brought me to a more calm pau&s;e than I had known for &s;ome time, and therein was ready to &s;ay, can the good hand be &s;till near to &s;tay me, Oh! that I may have patience given, and re&s;olu|tion &s;trengthned to continue &s;eeking, and if at la&s;t I &s;hould peri&s;h, that it may be at his foot&s;tool; for a &s;mall &s;pace I had &s;ome hope of beholding again him whom my &s;oul once loved above all things; but in a few miles riding it began to look plea&s;ant to me, to go into &s;ome remote place where I &s;hould not be known. When reflecting thus&mdash;what! aban|don mine acquaintance! violate my marriage cove|nant, and leave my neare&s;t connections! I &s;uddenly knew this pro&s;pect of plea&s;ure was from the evil one, and &s;omething in me abhorred it as wicked, and as it were clo&s;ed my eyes therefrom; &s;o that evening I went to the hou&s;e of a former intimate acquaintance to lodge, who received me kindly, and in the evening brought a book containing &s;ome a&s;tronomical problems, and began to conver&s;e very
<PB N="35" REF="016223_0041_0F9BD4707640FA20">
freely thereon, &s;uppo&s;ing it would be plea&s;ant to me as aforetime; but I was heavy in my &s;pirit and in|wardly thoughtful about &s;omething of another na|ture, and he &s;oon perceiving his conver&s;ation on that &s;ubject was di&s;agreeable, propo&s;ed my going to bed as fitte&s;t for a weary man, judging that to be my pre&s;ent ailment, I was glad of the offer and immediately accepted thereof. I &s;aw now clearly, that when my mind was turned from delighting in that wherein our former friend&s;hip con&s;i&s;ted, my company was rather unplea&s;ant to him, I &s;oon left his hou&s;e in the morning, di&s;patched my bu&s;ine&s;s, and returned home with as much &s;peed as I could, without the lea&s;t inclination to go el&s;ewhere; I believe my prayer was heard; for I had patience granted to me, I &s;ay granted, becau&s;e no man can endue him&s;elf therewith, and I think my di&s;tre&s;s gradually abated after the time aforementioned.</P>
<P>When one has fa&s;ted, and &s;uffered the want of natural food for a long &s;ea&s;on, men or prud|ence will portion out the food they give to &s;uch with care, that &s;trength may be increa&s;ed and the con&s;titution pre&s;erved healthful and &s;ound. The Lord, who&s;e Love and Care to his children doth far exceed that of any natural parent to his off|&s;pring, dealt with me in his tender mercy, giving at times by the gentle touches of his Love, to feel that he had not for&s;aken me, which in a few mi|nutes would be again withdrawn, but tho' of &s;hort continuance, was &s;ufficient for me to own it was worth all my &s;orrowful longing for and hereby he was plea&s;ed to let me experimentally know the value of Heavenly Bread by the want or it having food and raiment I was now taught to be therewith con|tent; the renewing of heavenly favour, and the covering of the Holy Spirit, &s;o as to be admitted to &s;tand before him in humble reverence with graci|ous acceptance, was all my &s;oul craved; I neither

wanted this man's gift, nor the other man's popu|larity and eloquence, but to be in mercy admitted into the number of his family, and occupying mine own gift to his honour alone that gave it. When Peter was examined by his Lord whom he had de|nied through fear, "Love&s;t thou me more than the&s;e?" the third time an&s;wered; "Thou knowe&s;t all things, thou knowe&s;t that I love thee:" He did not an&s;wer the que&s;tion in its full extent, <HI>viz. more than the&s;e</HI> with re&s;pect to the re&s;t of the Di&s;ciples who had not denied their Lord and Ma&s;ter, as Peter had done, who was neverthele&s;s looked upon with forgiving compa&s;&s;ion, and therefore had need to love in proportion; perhaps his hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion and appeal to his Ma&s;ter's knowledge might &s;horten his an&s;wer; his threefold charge of feeding the &s;heep and lambs of his Lord, was nece&s;&s;ary to gain his diligent attention to the work of him whom he had three times denied; he to whom much is forgiven, loveth much if he is not ungrateful: No marvel that I met with this trial of my love and affection, who &s;o often (not through fear, but the de&s;ire of indulg|ing my creaturely will, had denied, or neglected to follow my Lord and Ma&s;ter who had &s;o early made me acquainted with his will, and who now had pa&s;&s;ed by mine offences, and called me to work in his vineyard; now I was made thankful for fa|vours which before had &s;carcely been owned as &s;uch; for to be pre&s;erved inwardly watchful, and quietly re&s;igned, to wait upon the Lord, though we partake not of immediate con&s;olation by the renew|ing of life, is a great ble&s;&s;ing, for which we ought to be thankful, as we cannot &s;tay our own minds, nor curb our thoughts; and I did believe that la|bour was healthful, created an appetite and &s;weetned the reli&s;h of re&s;t and food in a &s;piritual as well as na|tural &s;en&s;e, and therefore I wanted not to eat the bread of idlene&s;s and live on the labour of others.</P>

I was thoughtful and low in my mind before, and had &s;ome rea&s;oning whe|ther it had not been better that I had &s;taid at home than ventured out on the &s;ervice at that time of the year. Though I thought I had an engagement &s;uffi|cient when I &s;et out; this query of his made me more thoughtful, and added to my rea&s;oning, but I &s;oon recovered &s;trength, and it came fre&s;h in my mind to a&s;k him whether friends could eat to &s;upply and &s;u&s;tain their bodies in the &s;ummer, and partake al&s;o of &s;piritual food for their &s;ouls in that &s;ea&s;on, &s;o as not to labour in the winter and care for the &s;u&s;tenance of their bodies, or a&s;&s;emble and attend meetings to wor&s;hip and wait upon God for &s;piritual food for their &s;ouls? he acknowledged I had by this query &s;atisfied him to the full, and &s;aid he was glad of my vi&s;it, and hoped his talking as he did would not di&s;courage me, for I believe he &s;aw it brought a damp over me at fir&s;t, this an&s;wer I be|lieve was given to me for mine own help, and was encouragement to me through this journey, in which I had mo&s;t of the time Jo&s;hua John&s;on of Londongrove for a companion, who was very agreeable, and in my return home I felt great peace.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the Summer following I went with Robert Jor|dan to We&s;t-river yearly-meeting in Maryland, and we vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meetings of friends in that province, and his company was profitably in|&s;tructive to me who was but young in the mini&s;try; I think I knew him well, he had a good gift of the mini&s;try, and was highly favoured in the living openings of Truth, but was often low in mind and very humble in &s;pirit; one time as we were riding together, he lagged behind for &s;everal miles, I a&s;ked him why he rode &s;o &s;low, he made no reply, whereupon I &s;topt until he came up, his counte|nance was &s;olid, and looked as if he had been weep|ing, I a&s;ked what ailed him, after &s;ome time he told me, that he had been thinking of the great favours which man partook of, particularly in being placed over the bea&s;ts of the field, and how ea&s;ily they were broke, and made &s;ubject to his will, what a &s;mall turn with the bridle would put them to the right hand or the left, and on a gentle motion would amend or &s;lacken their pace, at the will or plea&s;ure of the rider, and that man, the mo&s;t noble and in|telligent creature, &s;hould &s;o far neglect the duty of a willing &s;ubjection to his Maker, who &s;o highly
<PB N="39" REF="016223_0045_0F9BD474F6411578">
has favoured him with temporal ble&s;&s;ings, and the knowledge of heavenly things. I had been at that meeting about three years before, having had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to do for a friend of mine on the Ea&s;tern-&s;hore of Che&s;opeak, and cro&s;&s;ed over the Bay to the We&s;tern-&s;hore, and was at the yearly-meeting, and being grieved at the conduct of &s;ome of the elders, who&s;e age, if they had kept to the Truth and had been zealous for the honour thereof, would have made them better examples; I &s;poke my mind plainly to them, but not without proper caution (as I thought) both with re&s;pect to my youth and their age; but &s;ome &s;eemed a little warmed thereby, and a&s;ked for my certificate, if I had any, I hone&s;t|ly told them, the principal bu&s;ine&s;s that brought me from home was temporal, which having accomo|dated, I thought I might attend that meeting with|out offence, if I did not mi&s;behave my&s;elf. William Richard&s;on de&s;ired friends to con&s;ider what I had &s;aid, for he believed if they did, they would per|ceive the young man had a certificate with him, that might an&s;wer for one of a neighbouring province to attend &s;uch a meeting.</P>
<P>It may not be un&s;ea&s;onable to relate that in the year 1736, one night as I lay in bed, my mind was uncommonly affected with the incomes of Divine Love and Life, and therein I had a view of the churches in New-Jer&s;ey, with a clear pro&s;pect that I &s;hould vi&s;it them, and in that pro&s;pect and the &s;trength of affection which I then felt, I &s;aid in my heart it is enough; I will prepare for the journey as &s;oon as I can hear of a &s;uitable companion, for I do not expect that I &s;hall have a clearer &s;ight than I now have, I &s;oon heard of a friend who had a vi&s;it to New-Jer&s;ey before him, I &s;poke to him about my concern, he let me know that he knew of a companion, and they had agreed upon a time to proceed; after I had mentioned it to him and &s;ome
<PB N="40" REF="016223_0046_0F9BD47556289798">
other friends my concern &s;eemed to die away; but I remembered the re&s;olution that I took up, and that I then thought I would not look to be bidden again, and was fearful &s;omething had drawn my mind from the proper attention to that opening, which was the rea&s;on it &s;eemed to go off; but the more I &s;trove to look after it, the duller it grew; I then &s;orely repented that I had &s;poken about it, and thought it &s;hould be a warning to me in future; for I began to &s;ee there was a difference between &s;ee|ing what was to be done, and being bidden to do the thing &s;hewn, be&s;ides this, I had to con&s;ider there was a time to bud, a time to blo&s;&s;om, a time for fruit to &s;et and appear, and a time for it to ripen.</P>
<P>And in the forepart of the winter (1738,) I thought it &s;eemed to revive, and when I &s;aw John Hunt a friend from England, I believed I &s;hould go with him when he went thro' New-Jer&s;ey, and told him what I thought, at which he rejoiced, for we were nearly united; &s;o we appointed a time to meet at Philadelphia, and when we had &s;o far concluded, being about &s;ix weeks beforehand, my concern, as I thought, &s;oon withered away, and I began to be in great fear that I had been again too forward therein, but after &s;ome time of humbling exerci&s;e on that account, the Lord, whom I feared, from the Love with which he was plea&s;ed to enrich my heart, gave me to remember, that when I made the ap|pointment with my friend, it was in his fear and great aba&s;ement of &s;elf, and as I had &s;een clearly to make the appointment, it was my place to attend in humble reliance on him for ability to perform the emba&s;&s;y; for the Lord who calleth and &s;endeth forth his own, will al&s;o provide all things convenient for them.</P>
<P>When the time came, I &s;et forward very poor and needy, which continued until we entered our
<PB N="41" REF="016223_0047_0F9BD475F8A56B48">
&s;ervice; we took a few meetings before our general &s;pring meeting; and after attending that, we went to Woodberry, Piles-grove, Salem, Alloways-creek, Cohan&s;ie, and &s;o to Cape-may, and had &s;ome clo&s;e work, but in the main &s;atisfactory to our&s;elves at lea&s;t; after having &s;everal meetings at and near the Capes, we went to Great-Egg-harbour and had a meeting there, and another at the hou&s;e of our friend Japhet Leeds, and &s;o over the Marines to Little-Egg-harbour river, and had two meetings with friends, in one of which I &s;tood up with a large opening as I thought, but after a &s;hort introduction, it clo&s;ed up, and I &s;at down again, which was &s;ome mortification to me as a man, tho' very profitable, being thereby taught to know, that he that would &s;peak as the oracle of God, mu&s;t, under the gentle burden of the word, in humble fear wait for wi&s;|dom, utterance, and ablility to perform the &s;ervice to the edification of the church and his own inward Peace, and not to look after large and &s;pecious openings, &s;ometimes de&s;irable to the creaturely part both in our&s;elves and others, which mu&s;t &s;uffer famine.</P>
<P>At one of the meetings in the&s;e parts, coming very early, a friend belonging thereto invited us to go to his hou&s;e not far off, and he would put up our hor&s;es to hay during the time of the meeting, &s;aying that we mu&s;t go to his hou&s;e to dine; but I felt a &s;top in my mind, and told him that our hor&s;es could &s;tand very well there until after meet|ing; it &s;o fell out that neither of us &s;aid any thing in the meeting, which neverthele&s;s was to us &s;atis|factory, for we had a &s;en&s;e that the people had been fed with words, and had a hunger thereafter, more than for the in&s;truction of the pure word of Power and Life nigh in the heart and mouth, that they might not only hear it but be found doers thereof: after the meeting no one a&s;ked us to dine, but went
<PB N="42" REF="016223_0048_0F9BD47BC61B2FC8">
away and left us, and had it not been for the care of our kind guide that came from the meeting we were la&s;t at, we &s;hould have been at a lo&s;s to have got forward; I mention this to &s;hew how unacceptable &s;ilence is to &s;uch who&s;e ears itch after words.</P>
<P>From hence we went thro' the de&s;ert to upper Springfield, where we had a &s;atisfactory meeting, then taking the meetings Northward to Stony|brook and Trenton, we returned to Bordentown, and &s;o cro&s;&s;ed Delaware. Some of the meet|ings were large and very &s;atisfactory under the owning of truth, the power whereof was in domi|nion, and the name of the Lord prai&s;ed, who is worthy forever; and &s;ome were remarkably clo&s;e and hard, which made me remember a &s;aying of that experienced mini&s;ter and elder John Fothergill, that, "When he was fir&s;t in this country, he had &s;ome extraordinary meetings hereaway, the people being indu&s;trious in a natural as well as &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, &s;ome of whom were now removed, and their children po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the temporal e&s;tates of their fa|thers, and though their outward habitations looked &s;pacious their meetings for wor&s;hip were dull and heavy, by rea&s;on of a wordly &s;pririt, and their in|difference about heavenly trea&s;ure." One meeting which we were at was remarkably hard; my com|panion J. H. was exceedingly exerci&s;ed, under a &s;en&s;e that the people were too rich, full, and whole in their own eyes, he &s;at the meeting through and &s;uffered in &s;ilence, but I had &s;omething to &s;ay very clo&s;e and particular, and felt a degree of the &s;trength and power of Truth to clear my&s;elf in an innocent and loving manner, and remembering they were brethren, did not preach my&s;elf out of charity towards them, and &s;o had peace. We went home with an elderly friend, who in a &s;tern manner a&s;ked me from whence I came, and &s;aid I was a &s;tranger to him, I an&s;wered him with a cheerful boldne&s;s;
<PB N="43" REF="016223_0049_0F9BD47CDBC04B38">
he a&s;ked me what my calling was, I told him hu&s;|bandry, he farther queried if I was u&s;ed to &s;plitting of wood, I let him know I had practi&s;ed it for ma|ny years, he again a&s;ked me, if I knew the mean|ing of a common &s;aying of tho&s;e who were u&s;ed to that bu&s;ine&s;s, "Tis &s;oft knocks mu&s;t enter hard blocks;" I told him I knew it well, but there were &s;ome old wood that was rather decayed at heart, and to &s;trike with a &s;oft or gentle blow at a wedge in &s;uch blocks, would drive it to the head without renting them and the labour would be lo&s;t, when a few &s;mart lively &s;trokes would bur&s;t them a&s;un|der; whereupon he laid his hand on my &s;houlder, &s;aying, "Well my lad, I perceive thou art born for a warrior, and I commend thee;" And thus we came off better than we expected, for I thought he pointed at my &s;ervice that day; he was ever after|ward very loving to me, and I was inwardly thank|ful that the Lord was near to me, for which I prai&s;e his &s;acred name. To be becomingly bold in the cau&s;e of Truth, at times is particularly nece&s;&s;ary, otherwi&s;e the weight of the te&s;timony thereof would be le&s;&s;ened, and a carping &s;pirit &s;et over it.</P>
<P>From Bordentown we went to Plum&s;tead in Bucks-county, and on a fir&s;t day had a pretty good meet|ing, and to a monthly-meeting at Buckingham, then to Wright&s;town, the Falls, and Middletown, which meetings were in a good degree &s;atisfactory, the reaches of the Power of Truth being felt to ex|tend, for which we were thankful; tho' in &s;ome of them, there is too great a want of faithful mem|bers to put the di&s;cipline in practice again&s;t tho&s;e that were di&s;orderly, and thereby brought a re|proach on the Truth; we then went to Philadel|phia, and next day to Che&s;ter, from whence I went home the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>In the fall of the year 1740, I had &s;ome draw|ings in my mind to attend the quarterly-meeting at
<PB N="44" REF="016223_0050_0F9BD47D833E17E8">
Shrew&s;bury, and was at &s;everal meetings on my way thither, at one of which a friend appeared, who I thought had good &s;ervice in the forepart of his te&s;timony, but as truth did not ri&s;e into domi|nion &s;o high as he expected, perhaps in too much zeal and creaturely warmth, he laid on a little too fa&s;t, and continued until the life rather abated, and &s;ome tender minds hurt; for it often happens that &s;uch to whom hard things belong, will put them off, and tho&s;e who are more tender and lea&s;t de&s;erving of &s;uch doctrine, will take it to them|&s;elves to their own hurt. Oh! how careful mini&s;|ters ought to be whil&s;t they are in their &s;ervice, that they may be favoured with an inward feeling &s;en&s;e of the &s;tates to which they mini&s;ter, and be influenced with Wi&s;dom from above to divide the word aright, in meekne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, and holy fear, then truth will have its own weight, authori|ty and power. After the friend &s;at down, it be|came the concern of another in a few words, as it were to number the &s;lain, and &s;earch for the wound|ed, and &s;et clo&s;e and hard things where they be|longed, by de&s;cribing their &s;everal di&s;po&s;itions in choo&s;ing and refu&s;ing to take hard things. After|wards being in company with the friend above hinted, and he being down in his mind and per|haps not fully knowing the cau&s;e, a&s;ked me what I thought of the meeting, to which I was not for|ward to an&s;wer; he &s;aid, tell me what I have done this day? whereupon I a&s;ked him privately and in a plea&s;ant manner, what Gideon did to the men of Succoth? <HI>Jud.</HI> viii. 16. at which he was greatly humbled, fully under&s;tanding what I meant, and did not in the lea&s;t re&s;ent the hint; which I thought was truly great in him, and very becoming a mi|ni&s;ter; for if we would in&s;truct others, we &s;hould be exemplary in taking in&s;truction our&s;elves when nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="016223_0051_0F9BD47E381B8298">On my way falling in company with Robert Jor|dan, we had a freedom to propo&s;e a meeting to the Anabapti&s;ts at Middletown, to which they readily con&s;ented, and we had a profitable opportunity with them in their meeting hou&s;e, and on the &s;ame evening a meeting at the hou&s;e of Hugh Hart&s;horne, to which &s;everal bapti&s;ts came; this was a time of favour, and I hope of &s;ervice, it was concluded by R. J. in &s;olemn prayer and thank&s;giving to the Lord, who is worthy forever and ever. Ju&s;t as the meeting broke up, I felt my&s;elf poor and inwardly weak, to as great a degree as ever I had done, and looking towards my &s;aid friend I &s;aw he was in the &s;ame condition, for it &s;eem'd as if we had hardly &s;trength to &s;tand; but a query of our dear Lord's came &s;uddenly into my mind and mini&s;tered relief <HI>viz.</HI> Who hath touched me? Whereupon leaning toward my companion, I repeated it to him, being my belief that it was as much for his help as my own. He under&s;tood the meaning in&s;tantly with|out further explanation, and was thereby al&s;o re|lieved. Perhaps &s;ome who may hereafter peru&s;e the&s;e lines, may think this is too bold for a mortal man to mention; but having by a degree of expe|rience known, that when the healing virtue of Truth from the holy Phy&s;ician of Souls, has flowed through an humble &s;ervant, to the relief of &s;ome of the infirm and poor among&s;t the people, who have followed phy&s;icians of no value, and &s;pent all their living thereby, and no cure wrought, not|with&s;tanding virtue has gone through them as in|&s;truments or conduits, they have felt inwardly weak for a time, that in humble aba&s;ement of &s;oul they might be taught to acknowledge, that the King|dom, Power, and Glory doth belong to him alone, who is God over all ble&s;&s;ed forever and ever.</P>

Shrew&s;bury, which was large in the &s;everal &s;ittings, in which was felt the power of Truth in a good de|gree; but many loo&s;e and rude people of the neigh|bourhood and parts adjacent coming together at &s;uch times to drink, carou&s;e, and ride races, are very hurt|ful to each other and di&s;turbing to friends. Then going homeward I had &s;everal meetings on the way, and enjoyed great inward peace, and could there|fore rejoice and a&s;cribe the prai&s;e to the Lord, who had called and enabled me to perform this &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Having a concern on my mind to vi&s;it the meetings of friends on the Ea&s;tern &s;hore in Maryland, I laid it before our monthly-meeting and obtained a cer|tificate in the tenth month; my brother in law James Brown bearing me company; and we were at Cae|cil monthly-meeting held at Che&s;ter in the eleventh month, before meeting a friend informed me that he thought it would be be&s;t for me to cro&s;s Che&s;ter river, and go directly Southward; I told him it might be &s;o, but I could &s;ay little to it at pre&s;ent; but &s;ome friends con&s;ulting about it, and one being there who lived near the meeting hou&s;e in Queen Anns county, they thought he could give notice on fir&s;t day to &s;everal meetings; &s;o a friend ventured to &s;peak publicly thereof at the clo&s;e of the meeting for wor&s;hip, without letting me know what he intended to do. I had been uncommonly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as I &s;at in the meeting, from an appre|hen&s;ion that but few of the friends belonging to that particular meeting were there, and when he publi&s;hed where it was propo&s;ed I &s;hould be the en&s;uing week, I felt my mind opened and turned another way, and &s;tood up and told friends, that I did believe they thought it mo&s;t for my ea&s;e to lay out the meetings after that manner, but if friends at that particular meeting would favour me &s;o far as to meet there next day, I &s;hould be glad to &s;it with them, provided they would plea&s;e to let other

friends and neighbours who were ab&s;ent know of it; for if I had a right &s;en&s;e, there were &s;everal members not pre&s;ent, and I &s;hould be willing to be at Caecil meeting on fir&s;t day, and Sa&s;&s;afra&s;s on &s;e|cond day, which was directly back, and therefore told them it &s;eemed ea&s;ie&s;t to my mind, tho' it would occa&s;ion more riding, this being agreed to, we had a much larger meeting next day, for many before were ab&s;ent as I had thought, and I had a full opportunity to di&s;charge my&s;elf toward the luke|warm and indifferent, and di&s;orderly walkers, and had peace; I vi&s;ited &s;everal families on &s;eventh day to good &s;atisfaction, and was at Caecil meeting on fir&s;t day, and the next day at Sa&s;&s;afra&s;s, and had to believe it was by the &s;ecret direction of the good &s;hepherd, who never faileth his dependant children, that I was turned this way; for he was plea&s;ed to own my &s;ervice in the&s;e meetings by his pre&s;ence in a good degree to the prai&s;e of his own name, which is worthy forever: From thence we pa&s;&s;ed over the Head of Che&s;ter by the bridge, John Browning, a friend from Sa&s;&s;afra&s;s, going with us as a guide, who &s;ome time before had been convinced of the ble&s;&s;ed Truth, by the inward operation of the Holy Spirit without any in&s;trumental means; he had been a member of the church of England &s;o called, and for his &s;obriety was cho&s;en a Ve&s;try|man; but after a time felt a &s;cruple in his mind about taking off his hat, when he entered the Church-yard &s;o called, fearing it was a &s;uper&s;titious adoration of the ground, from its &s;uppo&s;ed holine&s;s; but would take it off when he entered the wor&s;hip hou&s;e, and walk uncovered to his pew; but after a time could not uncover his head, till what they call Divine Service began; which as he kept in|wardly attentive to the &s;cruple in his mind, became very lifele&s;s to him, who was inwardly &s;eeking for &s;ub&s;tance and life; and therefore withdrew there|from;

and after &s;ome time went to one of our meet|ings, rather out of curio&s;ity than expecting any good, but felt him&s;elf owned, and had a ta&s;te of the peace which the world cannot give, and from that time became a con&s;tant attender of our meetings.</P>
<P>We had a meeting at Queen Ann's among&s;t a peo|ple who for want of keeping to the life of Religion, had almo&s;t lo&s;t the form: In conver&s;ation at a cer|tain hou&s;e in the evening, I a&s;ked a friend, whether &s;he was a friend's child or one convinced of our principles, her reply was, that when &s;he was young, &s;he lived at a friend's hou&s;e, and took a notion of going to meeting with them, which &s;he had done ever &s;ince; Ala&s;s! when notion changes the will, and not that faith which works by love to the purifying of the heart, the religion is without reformation, empty and dead. From thence we went to Tuckaho meeting, and the weather being very cold and ri|vers frozen up, &s;everal ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els and &s;ailors came there and divers others people of fa&s;hion with gay cloathing; in the fore part of the meet|ing there was an appearance made which grieved me, for my heart yearned towards the people; the words that he began with were "Wo, wo, to the crown of pride and drunkards of Ephraim;" and with very little application &s;at down; it appeared to me as if the appearance of gaiety had fired the creaturely zeal, which was the chief motion to this &s;hort &s;ermon, this with the cold wind blowing in at the door, much un&s;ettled the meeting, it being at the time when that remarkable &s;now fell which laid &s;o long in deep drifts this winter; whereupon I de|&s;ired the door might be &s;hut, which being done, the hou&s;e became more comfortable, and the meet|ing &s;ettled, and I &s;tood up with an heart filled with affection, having that pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture before me, in which the apo&s;tle Peter declared the univer|&s;ality of the Love of God, "I perceive of a Truth that God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" and was

much enlarged thereon to my own admiration, and I believe &s;atisfaction of the people; the meeting ended &s;weetly with thank&s;giving and prayer to the Lord for the continuance of his mercy who is the alone author of all good, and worthy of adoration and wor&s;hip forever. After which we attended the &s;everal neighbouring meetings, through very &s;evere cold weather, and the hou&s;es being very open and unprovided with the means of keeping them warm, of which there is too manife&s;t a neglect in tho&s;e parts, they were uncomfortable and un&s;ettled; in this jour|ney my companion appeared in a few words in &s;eve|ral families and meetings; we reached home ju&s;t be|fore our quarterly-meeting in the twelfth month.</P>
<P>In this journey, travelling in Talbot county, an elderly man a&s;ked us if we &s;aw &s;ome po&s;ts &s;tanding, pointing to them and added, the fir&s;t meeting George Fox had on this &s;ide of Che&s;opeak Bay, was held in a tobacco hou&s;e there which was then new; the po&s;ts that were &s;tanding were made of walnut, at which John Browning above mentioned rode to them, and &s;at on his hor&s;e very &s;till and quiet; then returning to us again with more &s;peed than he went, I a&s;ked him what he &s;aw among&s;t tho&s;e old po&s;ts, he an&s;wered,
<Q>I would not have mi&s;&s;ed of what I &s;aw for five pounds, for I &s;aw the root and grounds of Idolatry; before I went I thought perhaps I might have felt &s;ome &s;ecret virtue in the place where George Fox had &s;tood and preached, whom I believe to have been a good man; but whil&s;t I &s;tood there, I was &s;ecretly in|formed, that if George was a good man, he was in Heaven and not there, and virtue is not to be communicated by dead things, whether po&s;ts, earth, or curious pictures, but by the power of God who is the fountain of living virtue.</Q>
A le&s;&s;on, which if rightly learned, would wean from the wor&s;hip of images and adoration of relicts.</P>

<P>This &s;pring of the year 1742, I felt &s;trong draw|ings of mind to vi&s;it friends in New-England, hav|ing had &s;ome view thereof &s;everal years before; and having obtained a certificate, I &s;et forward in the third month, and after vi&s;iting &s;everal meetings in New-Jer&s;ey, and one in New-York, I attended the yearly-meeting on Long I&s;land, wherein the power of truth was felt, and a great openne&s;s to tho&s;e of other &s;ocieties, many of whom were pre|&s;ent, particularly the la&s;t day, and two prie&s;ts who be haved &s;olidly.</P>
<P>I then went with Samuel Hopwood (a mini&s;tring friend from England, with whom I had traveled in this journey through part of New-Jer&s;ey) to Ryewood, and had a meeting there, where were a few &s;olid friends, but others too talkative; and be|ing at Old-Seabrook had a meeting in an inn, on the fir&s;t day of the week, the people being chiefly Pre&s;byterians, few attended be&s;ides our&s;elves, and tho&s;e of the family who were kind and civil to us; then going to Conanicut we had a meeting with friends on that I&s;land, and proceeded to Newport on Rhode-i&s;land, and on the fifth day of the week attended the meeting at Port&s;mouth, where we met with Lydia Dean from Penn&s;ylvania, who was on a religious vi&s;it to friends in New-England, and

many other friends coming to be at the yearly-meet|ing on this I&s;land; it began on the &s;ixth day of the week with a meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, and two meetings for public wor&s;hip, one in the fore|noon and the other in the afternoon, and were held in the &s;ame order until the &s;econd day of the next week, when the meeting for di&s;cipline began; this large yearly meeting in the &s;everal &s;ettings thereof was generally &s;olid and &s;atisfactory; after which tak|ing divers meetings in our way, namely, Port&s;|mouth, Tiverton, Seconet, Accoake&s;et, and Aponi|gang&s;et, and attending their monthly-meeting there, all which were in a good degree &s;atisfactory, S. Hopwood and my&s;elf embarked for Nantucket, and through the mercy of kind providence arrived &s;afe there, after a pa&s;&s;age of three days and two nights, occa&s;ioned by &s;cant winds, and an Ea&s;terly &s;torm which tore our &s;ails very much, being old and rot|ten, &s;o that if &s;ome watchful friends on the I&s;land had not &s;een us in di&s;tre&s;s, and come with three whale boats, and took all the pa&s;&s;engers being twen|ty four of us from the ve&s;&s;el, we &s;hould have been in great danger; for being near a &s;and bar, the ve&s;|&s;el &s;truck ground &s;oon after we left her, and by the violence of the wind was driven on &s;hore: We looked on this deliverance as a mercy from God, to whom &s;everal of us were bowed in humble thankfulne&s;s for this particular favour: On the twenty-&s;econd day of the fourth month the yearly-meeting began, which though &s;mall on this day by rea&s;on of the &s;torm, was comfortable, the other &s;ittings were mo&s;tly large and in a good degree own|ned by the power and virtue of Truth.</P>
<P>My friend S. Hopwood apprehending him&s;elf clear, inclined to return to the Main-land, but no pa&s;&s;age offered; and notwith&s;tanding the meetings had been generally attended by mo&s;t of the Inha|bitants of the I&s;land, and large, yet I was not ea&s;y

without endeavouring to have &s;ome opportunities with friends by them&s;elves, as much as could be, which I obtained, be&s;ides attending their u&s;ual week day meeting and in the&s;e &s;ittings, it plea&s;ed the Lord to open my way to deliver &s;everal things which had lain heavy on my mind; for although &s;ome &s;olid tender &s;pirited friends lived on this I&s;land, yet I &s;aw there was a libertine &s;pirit &s;ecretly at work among&s;t &s;ome others, to draw away from the pure inward life of religion and the &s;implicity of Truth, into ea&s;e and liberty; after which I had great peace, and my mind was made thankful to the Lord, who had owned my labour by a good degree of his pre|&s;ence and power.</P>
<P>Being now fully clear and a pa&s;&s;age offering, on the &s;econd of the fifth month we took leave of our friends, and landed the &s;ame day in the evening at Seconnet, and on &s;eventh day S.

Hopwood, and on third day we had a meeting at Yarmouth, and returning to Humphrey Wady's, we from thence went towards Bo&s;ton, taking a meeting with friends at Pembrook, reached that town on &s;ixth day, and attended their morning and afternoon meetings on fir&s;t day, al&s;o one at a friends hou&s;e in the evening. I have here little to remark, &s;ave that religion &s;eems to be at a low ebb From Bo&s;ton I went to Lynn, but S.

river on the Kittery &s;hore among friends, which was &s;atisfactory to my&s;elf and them, there being a ten|der people there: On third day morning as I lay in bed, I felt my mind drawn towards the North-we&s;t, which was an exerci&s;e to me, for I had before thought my&s;elf at liberty to return towards Bo&s;ton; I aro&s;e about &s;un ri&s;e, and a&s;ked the friend where I lodged, whether any friends lived at a di&s;tance on that quarter, for that I had a draft that way, he an&s;wered no, and a&s;ked how far I thought to go, I told him it did not &s;eem to me to be more than ten miles; he &s;aid there was a people about eight miles di&s;tant, which he &s;uppo&s;ed was the place to which I felt the draft; I de&s;ired him to &s;end a lad with a few lines to &s;ome per&s;on that he knew, to inform them that a &s;tranger would be glad to have a meeting among them at the eleventh hour of that day, if they were free to grant it, which he did and with his wife went with me; &s;o that we got to the place near the time propo&s;ed, and found a con&s;iderable gathering of people, that I wondred how it could be in &s;o &s;hort a time, not more than three hours warning; they were preparing &s;eats by laying boards on blocks in a pretty in large new hou&s;e, and &s;oon &s;at down in an orderly manner; I went in great fear and inward weakne&s;s, and at the &s;ight of &s;uch a gathering of people, and none of our profe&s;&s;ion among them except the friend and his wife who accompanied me, and two others who joined us on the way, my &s;pirit was greatly bowed, and my heart filled with &s;ecret cries to the Lord, that he would be plea&s;ed to magnify his own power, and ble&s;&s;ed for ever be his holy name! he heard my cry, and furni&s;hed with wi&s;dom and &s;trength to declare his word to the people, among whom there were &s;ome very tender &s;eekers after the true know|ledge of God; and the doctrine of Truth flowed freely towards them, the univer&s;ality of the love of

God being &s;et forth in oppo&s;ition to the common prede&s;tinarian notion of election and reprobation; when the meeting was over I felt an uncommon freedom to leave them, for they began to &s;hew their &s;atisfaction with the opportunity in many words, &s;o &s;peaking to the friend who went with me, we withdrew and went to our hor&s;es, and I immedi|ately mounting, beheld the man of the hou&s;e where the meeting was held running to me, who taking hold of the bridle, told me I mu&s;t not go away with|out dining with them; I look'd &s;teadfa&s;tly on him; and told him, that I did believe this was a vi&s;itation for their good, but I was fearful that they, by talk|ing too freely and too much, would be in danger of lo&s;ing the benefit thereof, and mi&s;s of the good that the Lord intended for them, and my going away was in order to example them to go home to their own hou&s;es, and turn inward, and retire to that of God in their own hearts, which was the only way to grow in religion; &s;o I left him, and returned with my friend Jo&s;eph Ea&s;tees and his wife. Next day I was again at Cachechy meeting where Lydia Dean and her companion Eliphal Har|per met me, it was a good meeting; from thence we went to Dover and had a meeting, and another the &s;ame evening at the hou&s;e of John Kenny, and being clear in my mind of tho&s;e parts, I returned, having meetings at Hampton, Sali&s;bury, Aim&s;bury, and Haverhill, at which la&s;t place, &s;everal per&s;ons were a&s;&s;embled with us who had never heared the preaching of any friend before; there was great openne&s;s among them, and we had a good meeting together, for which I was thankful to the holy au|thor of all good. Next day I again met with Lydia Dean and E. Harper, at Stephen Sawyer's near Newberry where we had a meeting, at which I was concerned to &s;peak in a brief manner of the begin|ning of the reformation from the errors of the
<PB N="57" REF="016223_0063_0F9BD49A6452B4C0">

<Q>he &s;uppo&s;ed I was a man that had read much, or I could not be &s;o fully acquainted with the reformation, and that he al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed I had a College education;</Q>
as to the la&s;t, I told him that I never had been at a &s;chool but about three months, and the man I went to being a weaver, &s;at in his loom and heard his &s;cholars read; that I was &s;o far from having a po|pular education, that I was born in a wilderne&s;s place, where a few families had &s;ettled many miles remote from other inhabitants; at which, lifting up his hands, he ble&s;&s;ed him&s;elf and added, "Heaven has then anointed you to preach the Go&s;pel, and you have this day preached the truth; but I can

<P>The next day I had a meeting at Ip&s;wich in the hou&s;e of Benjamin Hoeg, none profe&s;&s;ing with us living in that town but him&s;elf and family; tho' there was a friendly man, who, as I came late to the town the evening before, invited me to lodge at his hou&s;e, of which I accepted, and being weary &s;lept well; in the morning I heard a noi&s;e of high words in the &s;treet, and getting up I opened the door of the parlour where I lodged, and through a pa&s;&s;age into the kitchen, &s;aw a woman whom I took to be the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, and went toward her; but with a look of exceeding di&s;plea|&s;ure &s;he immediately &s;hut the door, &s;o I turned into my room again; after a while the landlord came to me, and told me that he had been with the Burge&s;s, who had given leave that a meeting might be held in the Town-hall; but the prie&s;t and his two &s;ons had &s;ince been with the Burge&s;s and forbad him, and that rather than di&s;plea&s;e them, he had withdrawn the leave; the prie&s;t a&s;&s;erted that the Quakers were heretics, and had gone about the town to forewarn his hearers again&s;t going to the meeting, which was the meaning of the noi&s;e I had heard in the &s;treet; I felt very ea&s;y, and de&s;ired that he would not trouble him&s;elf any further than to inform them, that the meeting would be held at the hou&s;e of B. Hoeg; for I did believe that the railing of the prie&s;t would rai&s;e the curio&s;ity of the people the more to come, and &s;o it proved: I a&s;ked him to &s;hew me the way to the hou&s;e, that I might be a&s;&s;i&s;tant in making provi&s;ion for &s;eats if occa&s;ion required, he &s;aid I mu&s;t take breakfa&s;t with him, which was &s;oon brought in by the woman who had &s;hut the door as before mentioned: I a&s;ked him

if &s;he was his wife, he told me &s;he was, on which I aro&s;e from my &s;eat and offered her my hand, a&s;king her how &s;he did, but &s;he in di&s;plea&s;ure refu&s;ed, and &s;aying not a word, directly left the room; after breakfa&s;t we went to the hou&s;e where the meeting was to be held, and there &s;oon came a great number of people, and the prie&s;t al&s;o very near the door, where he &s;tood cautioning his hear|ers; but &s;everal came by an alley to the back door, and others &s;eemed little to regard him, that after a time he went away, and through the goodne&s;s of the Lord we had a &s;olid profitable meeting; for I believe many were there who&s;e hearts were reached and tendered by the love and power of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and among them I &s;aw my &s;cornful land|lady; it &s;eems, a woman whom &s;he valued had per|&s;uaded her to come with her; before the meeting ended, I perceived her countenance was changed and her &s;tout heart tendered, and after it &s;he came to me with her hu&s;band, and kindly invited me to dine with them; I owned their love, and de&s;ired them to mind the Truth by which they had been reached; &s;o in humble thankfulne&s;s of heart to the great Author of all living mercies, I left them, and went that night to Salem; and tarrying one meeting the next day, pa&s;&s;ed on to Marblehead and had a meeting in the Town-hall, the magi&s;trates readily granting it, which was large. I had to &s;peak on morality, the nature and nece&s;&s;ity thereof, &s;hewing that a man could not be a true Chri&s;tian without being a good morali&s;t; I thought they had need of a reformation in their morals, tho' they profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tianity in a high manner; one thing is worthy of remarking, the &s;elect men and officers were very careful to keep the rude boys and people that came to the door from making di&s;turbance, &s;everal of them walked to the door and &s;poke to them, and rapped &s;ome on their heads with their canes to

make them &s;till; the meeting ended to &s;atisfaction without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition; from thence, taking a meeting at Lynn by the way, I went to Bo&s;ton, and was at their meetings on fir&s;t day in the forenoon and afternoon, at both which, &s;everal came that were not in profe&s;&s;ion with us, and truth opened the doctrine thereof to the people pretty freely; but I was not ea&s;y to leave this town without having on opportu|nity with friends by them&s;elves, for which purpo&s;e it was held at Benja. Bagnall's, and therein I was deeply bowed under a &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate of ea&s;e in which &s;ome were delighting them&s;elves in their imaginary attainments, whil&s;t the pure &s;eed lay un|der &s;uffering; but ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to endue with a &s;pirit of Love and tender compa&s;&s;ion, and thereby enabled me to di&s;charge my&s;elf fully, and I was relea&s;ed from what had lain very heavy upon me for &s;everal days; the next day I had an opportunity with &s;everal friends at Samuel Pope's, and then left Bo&s;ton pret|ty ea&s;y in my mind, and went to Samuel Thayres at Mendam, who accompanied me the next day to Uxbridge, where we had a meeting with a few raw, talkative people, which, through the goodne&s;s of God, was neverthele&s;s to &s;ome degree of &s;atisfacti|on; I returned with Sam. Thayre to his hou&s;e, where I met with Hannah Jenkin&s;on from Penn&s;ylvania, and we were at Mendam meeting together; &s;he then went towards Bo&s;ton, and I to Wain&s;okett, and Providencetown, and had a meeting at each place, the latter of which was a poor meeting, the people looking for words and not waiting for the word of life in their own hearts; from thence I went to and had a large and good meeting at Ne&s;|hanticut, the Lord's pre&s;ence being felt to his own prai&s;e, and another at Greenwich; then proceeded to Smithfield and Taunton, taking a meeting at each to &s;ome good degree of &s;atisfaction; from
<PB N="61" REF="016223_0067_0F9BD4A21A3D7010">
thence to Swanzey, Freetown, Roche&s;ter, and Cu&s;hnet, having a meeting at each, at one of which, after I &s;tood up to &s;peak a few words in great fear, life being low and as I apprehended the &s;eed under &s;uffering, I heard a kind of &s;ighing by one in the gallery, which &s;eemed to bring death rather than to rai&s;e life, and after I had &s;poken a &s;entence or two, it became exceedingly burthen&s;ome; where|upon it came fre&s;h in my mind to &s;ay; "can an I&s;raelite &s;ing a true Hebrew &s;ong whil&s;t the &s;eed is in captivity and under &s;uffering? an attempt of the kind &s;hews ignorance." At which there was a great &s;ilence and the &s;ighing ended, and I receiv|ed &s;trength to deliver what was on mind, and truth was felt in a good degree to ari&s;e; the meeting end|ed well, and &s;everal friends expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atis|faction with the &s;ervice on that day. Being clear of tho&s;e parts I went to Rhode-i&s;land, and in a &s;en&s;e of the goodne&s;s and mercy of the Lord who had helped me in my travels in his work, my &s;oul wor|&s;hipped before him.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;econd of the &s;ixth month I &s;at with friends at Newport in their fore and afternoon meetings, and next morning left Rhode-i&s;land with a heavy heart and had a meeting at South King&s;ton, where I met with Su&s;anna Morris and her &s;i&s;ter Hannah Hurford, and the &s;ame day had a meeting at James Parry's, and the day following we had one at Thomas Stanton's in We&s;terly, among a mixed people of &s;everal &s;ocieties, to whom I felt a &s;tream of go&s;pel love; but the meeting was hurt by &s;everal appearances of one pre&s;ent who lived at no great di&s;tance. Our manner of &s;itting in &s;ilence is &s;o very different from the common practice of mo&s;t other religious &s;ocieties, that it is no marvel if it &s;hould be as time mi&s;pent to &s;ome, and fill others with wonder, which was the ca&s;e this day; and for want of a deep inward attention to the living word

of Truth, in&s;tead of in&s;tructing the people in the true way of wor&s;hip in the love of the Go&s;pel, there may be a warm cen&s;uring of them for what they under&s;tand not, and thereby rai&s;e a di&s;like in them, to the foreclo&s;ing of other &s;ervice; and I have &s;ome|times ob&s;erved hurt done by this means, by &s;ome who appeared in the impatience, not having the weight of the work upon them; cu&s;tom had taught the people to look for words, and they were offend|ed by words &s;poken not in &s;ea&s;on, and therefore not fitly &s;poken; I left this meeting with &s;orrow, and after I mounted my hor&s;e, the per&s;on who had appeared there three times, came to me, and &s;aid "he hoped he had not hindered my &s;ervice in it;" I reminded him, that he had informed the people in that meeting, their looking for words had been one rea&s;on, why the Lord had &s;hut up the te&s;timo|ny of Truth in the hearts of his &s;ervants, which I told him I did believe was not then the ca&s;e; but that his forward appearances had mudded the wa|ters, un&s;ettled the people, and marred the &s;ervice, &s;o we parted; and feeling my mind drawn back towards Newport, I went that evening to James Congdon's, and the next day to Newport, calling in my way at James Parry's, where I found Lydia Dean very &s;ick, &s;he being &s;o far on her journey towards home, and on the fifth day of the week I was at two &s;atisfactory meetings there, and on &s;eventh day had a &s;mall meeting at Nicholas Ea&s;|ton's, and on fir&s;t day two large good meetings at Newport, and next day hearing that Lydia Dean was come to Samuel Clark's on Conanicut I&s;land, I went with &s;everal others to &s;ee her, and &s;he re|turned with us to Newport, where after a very &s;hort notice we had a large evening meeting, wherein the Lord was plea&s;ed mercifully to favour us with his immediate pre&s;ence to the glory and prai&s;e of his own eternal name which is worthy for ever!

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the Spring of the Year 1743, having draw|ings in my mind to make a general vi&s;it to Friends on Long-I&s;land, I &s;at out in the third month, in order to be at the Yearly-meeting at Flu&s;hing, which began on the &s;ixth day of the week, and continued until the &s;econd of the week following; it was large and &s;ignally owned by the power of Truth in each &s;itting; the publick &s;ervice in the mini|&s;try lay mo&s;tly on Edmund Peckover, who was there in his way to New-England; on fir&s;t day I thought I had an engagement to &s;tand up, and con&s;iderable matter before me, and after &s;peaking three or four &s;entences which came with weight, all clo&s;ed up, and I &s;tood &s;till and &s;ilent for &s;everal minutes, and &s;aw nothing more, not one word to &s;peak; I per|ceived the eyes of mo&s;t of the people were upon me, they, as well as my&s;elf expecting more; but nothing further appearing, I &s;at down, I think I may &s;ay in reverent fear and humble re&s;ignation, when that remarkable &s;entence of <HI>Job,</HI> chap. i. 21. was pre&s;ented to my mind, <HI>Naked came I out of my mothers womb, and naked &s;hall I return; the Lord

gave, and the Lord hath taken away; ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord,</HI> and for, I &s;uppo&s;e, near a quar|ter of an hour I remained in a &s;ilent quiet; but af|terwards let in great rea&s;onings and fear le&s;t I had not waited the right time to &s;tand up, and &s;o was &s;uffered to fall into reproach; for the adver&s;ary who is ever bu&s;y, and unwearied in his attempts to de|vour, per&s;uaded me to believe that the pleople would laugh me to &s;corn, and I might as well return home immediately and privately, as attempt any further vi&s;it on the I&s;land; after meeting I hid my inward exerci&s;e and di&s;tre&s;s as much as I could, when night came I lodged with a &s;ympathizing friend and ex|perienced elder, who began to &s;peak encouragingly to me, but I &s;aid to him, that I hoped he would not take it ami&s;s if I de&s;ired him to forbear &s;aying any thing; for if he &s;hould &s;ay good things, I had no capacity to believe, and if otherwi&s;e, I could not then under&s;tand &s;o as to be profitably corrected or in&s;tructed, and after &s;ome time fell a&s;leep; when I awoke, I remembred that the &s;entences I had de|livered in the meeting, were &s;elf evident truths, which could not be wre&s;ted to the di&s;advantage of friends, or di&s;honour of the cau&s;e of Truth, tho' they might look like roots or &s;omething to para|phra&s;e upon, and altho' my &s;tanding &s;ome time &s;ilent before I &s;at down might occa&s;ion the people to think me a &s;illy fellow, yet they had not cau&s;e to blame me for delivering words without &s;en&s;e or life; thus I became very quiet, and not much depre&s;&s;ed, and was favoured with an humble re&s;ignation of mind, and a de&s;ire that the Lord would be plea&s;ed to magnify his own name and truth, and pre&s;erve me from bringing any reproach thereon; &s;o I ven|tured to have meetings appointed, and my particu|lar friend and intimate acquaintance Caleb Raper of Burlington, being at that meeting, went as com|panion with me, of who&s;e company I was glad, he

being a valuable elder: We went fir&s;t to Rockaway, then to Jamaica, Sequetague, Setakit, Matinicock, Cowneck, and We&s;tbury meetings, and at mo&s;t of them I had good &s;atisfaction; the good pre&s;ence of the Lord in whom I delighted above all things, be|ing witne&s;&s;ed to my comfort, and I believe to the edification and comfort of the &s;incere in heart; but the te&s;timony of Truth went particularly &s;harp to the lukewarm profe&s;&s;ors and libertines in our &s;ocie|ty; that humbling time I had at Flu&s;hing was of &s;ingular &s;ervice to me, being thereby made willing|ly &s;ubject to the Divine openings of Truth, and motion of the eternal Spirit and pure word of Life, in &s;peaking to the &s;everal &s;tates of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent in the meetings, and life came into dominion, and the power thereof over&s;hadowed at times, to my humble admiration, ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord who is worthy for ever and ever!</P>
<P>Then cro&s;&s;ing White&s;tone ferry we had meet|ings at We&s;t-Che&s;ter, Momarineck, Rywoods, and Longreach, which were mo&s;tly to good &s;atisfaction, we then went to New-York and were at their meet|ing, and in the evening had a &s;elect one with friends, which gave me con&s;iderable relief, and I believe &s;atisfaction to them, and we were made thankful together in the renewings of the covenant of life; from thence we went to a meeting at Newtown on Long-I&s;land, and to the monthly-meeting at Flu&s;h|ing, where friends gave me a certificate in return to that I brought from home, in which they &s;igni|fied their unity with my &s;ervice on the I&s;land; then taking leave of friends in &s;weetne&s;s of mind and inward peace, being clear of tho&s;e parts I returned homewards, and went to the Narrows that night, but could not get over; next morning early cro&s;&s;ed the ferry, when there was a great &s;well, occa&s;ioned by the &s;tormy weather in the evening and night before, and having now no wind were obliged to

row the boat over; in the pa&s;&s;age I remembred, that in cro&s;&s;ing this ferry when coming on this vi&s;it, I thought my&s;elf never much poorer, having only a &s;ecret hope and tru&s;t in the holy arm of Power, and being now inwardly &s;en&s;ible of my own weakne&s;s, I had to acknowledge that I went not forth on this emba&s;&s;y in my own will and &s;trength, and therefore craved only, that my ble&s;&s;ed Lord and ma&s;ter would blot out mine offences, and yet enable me &s;o to walk in humble obedience the re&s;idue of my time, as to be favoured with the an&s;wer of well done at the con|clu&s;ion; and knowing the nature and treachery of &s;elf, did not want to be intru&s;ted with much reward at pre&s;ent, choo&s;ing rather, that the Lord in his in|finite wi&s;dom and mercy, &s;hould deal out to me my daily bread according to his own plea&s;ure, <HI>bipa&s;&s;ed over this Jordan with my &s;taff and now I am become two bands,</HI> was the &s;aying of Jacob <HI>Gen.</HI> xxxii. 10.

<P>I went not much abroad the re&s;idue of this &s;um|mer, and the year following; but was careful to at|tend our own and many neighbouring meetings, al&s;o monthly, quarterly and yearly-meetings in this and the adjacent province, &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of a pub|lic nature, together with my own circum&s;tances, nece&s;&s;arily engaged me for &s;everal years, in which

time, <HI>viz.</HI> in the &s;pring of the year 1745, my dear wife having drawings in her mind to vi&s;it the meet|ings of friends in Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina, obtained a certificate of the unity of friends with her, to travel in that &s;ervice with Jane Ho&s;kins of Che&s;ter; and in the &s;ame year I was nominated with &s;everal other friends to vi&s;it the families be|longing to our monthly-meeting, which being large and many friends living at a di&s;tance, was a labori|ous work, and not fully peformed until the fall of the year 1747, when account was given that the &s;ervice was perfected to a good degree of &s;atisfacti|on. In the winter following, I had it on my mind to vi&s;it all the families of the particular meeting of Newark near Brandywine, who &s;eemed to be in a declining &s;tate as to religion, having dropped their week day meeting, and often much neglected to attend their fir&s;t day meeting, many of the elderly friends being decea&s;ed, and their children almo&s;t turned to the world, and united to the &s;pirit, plea|&s;ures, and pa&s;times thereof; my brother W^m^. Brown, and his wife, and mine were with me on this &s;ervice, and great plainne&s;s was u&s;ed in opening to many particulars the cau&s;e of their declen&s;ion, and as the love of truth engaged me in the &s;ervice, I had peace and &s;atisfaction, and tho&s;e vi&s;ited &s;eemed to receive the vi&s;it kindly.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of the year 1748, I felt drawings in my mind to vi&s;it &s;ome families of friends in Philadelphia, of which I acquainted my brethren at home, and having their concurrence, in the fourth month I joined with &s;ome friends in the city who were &s;ometime before appointed to the &s;ervice, and we went in much love from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, the Lord, by his good pre&s;ence, being with us to our mutual comfort; and as I attended to the draw|ings of truth, I found a concern to go to the mayor of the city (accompanied by my good friend I&s;rael

Pemberton the elder,) and was engaged to lay be|fore him the nature of his office as a magi&s;trate, and exhorted him to take care that he bore not the &s;word in vain, but put the laws in execution again&s;t evil doers, &s;uch as drunkards, profane &s;wearers, &amp;c. and to be, in his authority, a terror to the wicked, and an encourager of them that do well; he was loving and tender, and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction with the vi&s;it.</P>
<P>While I was in the city, the Governor called or &s;ummoned the members of A&s;&s;embly together, and in pre&s;&s;ing terms laid before them the defencele&s;s &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, in order to prevail with the hou&s;e to grant a &s;um of money to &s;tation a &s;hip of force at Delaware capes, al&s;o to encourage the build|ing a battery below the city, which was began &s;ome|time before by &s;ub&s;cription, but likely to be too hea|vy for the undertakers; one night as I lay in my bed, it came very weightily upon me to go to the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, and lay before the members thereof the danger of departing from tru&s;ting in that divine arm of power which had hitherto protected the In|habitants of our land in peace and &s;afety; the con|cern re&s;ted on me &s;everal days, which occa&s;ioned me with earne&s;t breathings to &s;eek the Lord, that if this was a motion from him, he would be plea&s;ed to direct my &s;teps therein, &s;o that I might be pre|&s;erved from giving ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence to any, for it &s;eemed to be a very difficult time; many, even of our &s;ociety, declaring their willingne&s;s that a &s;um of money &s;hould be given to the King, to &s;hew our loyalty to him, and that they were willing to part with their &s;ub&s;tance for his u&s;e, tho' as a peo|ple, we had a te&s;timony to bear again&s;t all outward wars and &s;ightings; I made no man privy to my concern until a week had near pa&s;&s;ed; when one morning it became &s;o heavy upon me, that I went to the hou&s;e of an intimate friend, who being ju&s;t up invited me to come in, and as we &s;at together,

I told him, that I had it on my mind to go to the hou&s;e that morning and &s;hould be glad of &s;uitable company; he directed me to one whom he thought &s;uch, and I immediately went to him and acquainted him with my concern; but as I &s;pake, I felt that I had better go alone, and there|fore told him, that if he did not feel clear and ea&s;y to go with me, I advi&s;ed him to &s;tay; he replied "thy way is before thee, but I believe I mu&s;t not go:" I therefore returned to my friend, who did not di&s;courage me, tho' I had no company; being pre&s;&s;ed in mind, I went directly to the State-hou&s;e before I took breakfa&s;t, and got there ju&s;t as the &s;peaker, J. K. was going in, I beckoned to him and he came to me; I told him I wanted to be admitted into the hou&s;e, for I thought I had &s;omething to &s;ay to them which &s;eemed to me of importance; he &s;aid, it was a critical time, and they had a difficult affair before them, and queried, whether I had not better wait until the hou&s;e parted, and another member being near, &s;aid, he thought it would be be&s;t, and le&s;s liable to give offence, for there were divers members not of our &s;ociety, and if I would wait until the hou&s;e broke up, they would inform all the members that were friends, and did not doubt they would be willing to give me an oppor|tunity to inform them what was on my mind. I told them, that would give me no relief, for I had a particular de&s;ire that tho&s;e members who were not

of our &s;ociety &s;hould be pre&s;ent; believing that it would be better for them to hear and judge for them&s;elves than to have it at &s;econd hand, as it might be differently repre&s;ented; at which they were a little &s;ilent; then I reque&s;ted the &s;peaker that he would go in and inform the members, that a coun|try man was in waiting who had a de&s;ire to be ad|mitted, having &s;omething to communicate to them, and if they refu&s;ed he would be clear; he readily and affectionately an&s;wered he would, and &s;oon brought me word that they were willing. There was a great awe over my mind when I went in, which I thought in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;pread, and pre|vailed over the members beyond my expectation, after a &s;ilence of perhaps ten or twelve minutes, I felt as though all fear of man was taken away, and my mind influenced to addre&s;s them in &s;ub|&s;tance after the following manner.</P>

Brown left me and went home; I called to vi&s;it Hannah Cooper, who&s;e hu&s;band had not long been dead, &s;he &s;eemed under affliction of body and mind; I felt a near &s;ympathy with her, and tho' we did not conver&s;e much together, yet in the owning love of him who is a friend to the afflicted, we were mutually comforted; &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her &s;a|tisfaction in a tender manner, &s;aying that &s;oon after I came her exerci&s;e was lightened, and &s;he was re|fre&s;hed in a &s;en&s;e of the kindne&s;s of the Lord, in affording a &s;ympathy and inward feeling to the chil|dren of his family; my &s;oul was humbled in reve|rent thankfulne&s;s to him the author of all good, who is prai&s;e worthy for ever.

<P>On my leaving home to perform this vi&s;it, I felt great inward weakne&s;s, and in going from meeting to meeting, frequent humbling bapti&s;ms attended, in which the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the church was &s;een, and the conditions of many &s;poken to in the love of truth, which made me often think that it &s;eemed like a farewell vi&s;it, at lea&s;t for a long time.</P>

<P>As I &s;at in a week day meeting in the winter (1748,) which was held in a private hou&s;e, (our meeting hou&s;e being burnt &s;ometime before;) I felt great weakne&s;s and poverty attending my mind, which occa&s;ioned a deep inquiry into the cau&s;e; and after a time of inward waiting, the humbling divine pre&s;ence was felt in reverent profound &s;ilence, yet the gentle operation of the divine power cau&s;ed a &s;ecret inward trembling, and the following was uttered in a language intelligent to the inward man, <HI>gather thy&s;elf from all the cumbers of the world, and be thou weaned from the popularity, love, and friend|&s;hip thereof.</HI> I believed this to be the voice of the holy one of I&s;rael, as a merciful warning to pre|pare for my final change, or to &s;tand ready for &s;ome &s;ervice which would &s;eparate me from tempo|ral bu&s;ine&s;s and the neare&s;t connections in life; and from that time I endeavoured to &s;ettle my affairs, and contract my little bu&s;ine&s;s as well as I could. In the &s;ummer following I met with an unexpected trial, for without my knowledge my name was put in the new commi&s;&s;ion for ju&s;tices of the peace, and endeavours were u&s;ed to per&s;uade me to be quali|fied in order to act in that &s;tation, and &s;ome of my particular friends told me it &s;eemed providential, and they thought it was my place to accept there|of,

The propo&s;ition demanded my a&s;&s;ent, and my under&s;tanding was fully opened by the following application: "All that thou enjoye&s;t is mine, do&s;t thou love the&s;e things more than me? if not, why is it &s;o hard for

Now I was led to believe this was the in&s;truction of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit to me, and as I had much comfort and &s;atisfaction thereby, I am free to leave it as a hint, that others under trials of what kind &s;o ever, may be encouraged to look unto him for help, who is the Lord, migh|ty to &s;ave, and able to deliver to the uttermo&s;t all who &s;incerely tru&s;t in him.</P>

<P>ON the fourth day of the fourth month (1750) being the &s;econd of the week, we left Phila|delphia, accompanied by &s;everal of our relations and friends to Che&s;ter, and went on board the &s;hip Carolina, Stephen Me&s;nard commander, (bound for London,) where my brother W^m^.

Then pro|ceeding to Bath, was at the &s;orenoon and afternoon meetings there, and had an evening meeting at Caleb Tyley's, which were in &s;ome good degree owned by truth; but there is a want of weighty &s;olid friends in this place, which is much frequent|ed by mo&s;t &s;orts of people on account of the Wa|ters; from thence we went to Bradford, and Pick|wick meetings; but not being clear at the fir&s;t, I returned, and had an evening meeting there, to which many came, and it ended to &s;atisfaction.

<P>Leaving Exeter, we went to Top&s;ham and had a dark dull meeting, and &s;taying at a friend's hou&s;e to dine, one at the table, who, as I under&s;tood, could not &s;pare time to attend the meeting, a&s;ked me if I was ever in New-England, and whether I could inform him what &s;ort of a country it was? for, added he, I have heard people &s;ay, that the corn (that is wheat) will not ripen there, but is &s;mitten with a rotting mildew which bla&s;ts the wheat in the ear; I &s;uddenly felt that I had need of being careful in an&s;wering, but knew not why; I an&s;wer|ed with caution, that I had &s;een wheat in that coun|try which looked to be well grown, but in the ear where grain &s;hould be, there was little el&s;e but a black &s;mut in form of a grain; I have heard, &s;aid he, that it would bear full, good wheat formerly,

He replied with an air of je&s;ting, I have heard &s;o, but I believe nothing of it.

and taking the Ea&s;t part of the county, we had ten meetings, and vi&s;ited &s;everal indi&s;po&s;ed friends to good &s;atisfaction; then went to Yarmouth in Norfolk, and after attending their meetings in the morning and afternoon on fir&s;t day, had a large &s;atisfactory one the &s;ame evening, many of the people of the town coming to it; then going to Norwich we tarried with friends there about a week, in which time I had four meetings in that city, and one at Lammas near it, and al&s;o vi&s;ited divers indi&s;po&s;ed friends, and had &s;atisfaction there|in. Intending to vi&s;it all the meetings in Norfolk county, a friend undertook to lay them out for me, and made a li&s;t of them, of which he gave me a copy, and told me, it was the way to take the meet|ings with the lea&s;t traveling; but I felt a &s;trait in my mind, which I had always found &s;afe for me to attend to until I &s;aw a way open, and being thought|ful about it, I de&s;ired him to inform me, what meeting bore mo&s;t to the North Ea&s;t from that place, he told me it was North-Wal&s;am; I de&s;ired him to begin there, and name the meetings mo&s;t regular afterwards, and I would tell him if the li&s;t felt plea&s;ant as he went on; he then proceeded, and we readily fini&s;hed one which was ea&s;y to me; when I de&s;ired him to &s;et down the di&s;tances as he had done in the other, and on comparing them, we found the la&s;t to be at lea&s;t three miles le&s;s riding; he &s;eemed to be plea&s;ed, and &s;aid it was not the u&s;ual way of taking tho&s;e meetings; I was willing to lay out nine, but told him, I was not fully ea&s;y to venture the giving public notice further, that perhaps the weather might be difficult; he &s;aid there would be a general meeting in a few days, when friends from many meetings would be toge|ther, and likely to have full notice very ea&s;ily given for a few meetings further, which he thought I had be&s;t leave to him, &s;o we went forward to North-Wal&s;am,

and had a &s;atisfactory meeting, and taking the meetings in cour&s;e, came to the quarterly-meet|ing of mini&s;ters and elders at Norwich; the friend who laid out the meetings informed me, that if I had taken them according to his fir&s;t li&s;t, I &s;hould have interfered with a public friend at &s;everal, who was then on a vi&s;it, and he thought there was a hand of providence remarkable in turning me; for as we were both &s;trangers, we &s;hould have been &s;traitened through a tender regard to each others &s;ervice; he likewi&s;e let me know, that he did not remember that their quarterly-meeting began the next day after the meeting beyond which I told him I was not free to appoint any, and that having &s;ent the li&s;t to a friend to publi&s;h at the general meeting before mentioned, he had been obliged to attend that meeting to &s;top the notice re&s;pecting the few meetings he talked of, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have mi&s;|&s;ed the quarterly-meeting, and he thought it would teach him to be more cautious in future. I mention this occurrence with a degree of reverent thankful|ne&s;s and humility, with no other veiw than to en|courage tho&s;e mini&s;ters who are called forth to vi&s;it the churches, to diligently and innocently attend to the motion of truth, which the more we are humbled and inwardly quiet, the clearer it is un|der&s;tood and felt; but as this is in&s;truction for our|&s;elves, it is &s;afer for us to trea&s;ure it up in our own hearts, than to make it too cheap by talking there|of to others. This quarterly-meeting, both in re|&s;pect to public wor&s;hip and tran&s;acting the affairs of truth, was held to &s;atisfaction, through the Lord's favour, who will be near to them that diligently &s;eek him, ble&s;&s;ed be his name for ever!</P>
<P>Then taking Ellingham meeting, we went to Thetford, and had a meeting with friends there, both which were di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, from a &s;en&s;e of the prevalence of a ranting &s;pirit: Here it appeared

expedient to lay out meetings for the en&s;uing week, in order that &s;uitable notice might be given; and as they were named to me in cour&s;e by friends, I felt a remarkable de&s;ire to &s;ee the friends of one certain meeting by them&s;elves, at or near the ele|venth hour of the day, altho' quite a &s;tranger to their &s;ituation, numbers, or &s;tate; and a friend be|ing pre&s;ent belonging to that meeting, I reque&s;ted her care about it, and then went home with Richard Brew&s;ter to Edmond&s;bury, and attended the meet|ings there on the fir&s;t day morning and afternoon, which were in the main &s;atisfactory, and in the evening had a meeting with a &s;ick friend: In this town there is a con&s;iderable number of hopeful friends. We then went to Ratle&s;den, Bardwell, and through Livermore to Brand, the place where I had the de&s;ire to &s;ee friends by them&s;elves, as be|fore mentioned, and coming to the friend's hou&s;e who&s;e wife had been intru&s;ted with the notice, I a&s;ked her if it was not time to go to the meeting, &s;he &s;aid, thou mu&s;t a&s;k my hu&s;band, appearing to be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; I a&s;ked where he was, &s;he replied in his warehou&s;e, and &s;ent for him; he coming after a while, I &s;uppo&s;e about twelve o'clock, I a&s;ked him the time of the meeting, he an&s;wered at &s;ix in the evening (to be &s;ure;) I told him, that I had in|formed his wife of my de&s;ire that it &s;hould be at eleven; he replied, &s;he &s;aid &s;o but I thought it would be di&s;honorable, for few only would attend it at that time, for the people of that town were chiefly &s;uch as were obliged to do their days work, which would be fini&s;hed at &s;ix in the evening, when the hou&s;e would be nearly full; I told him, I did de&s;ire to &s;ee friends by them&s;elves, and &s;uppo&s;ed they could meet at any hour; he granted that they could have met at the the time propo&s;ed; but &s;aid, he was a man of a more liberal &s;pirit than to want to eat his mor&s;el alone, but was de&s;irous his neigh|bours

&s;hould partake with him, and thought it his duty to endeavour to inform and help tho&s;e whom he apprehended were backward or ignorant in the performance of their duty, and he &s;aid, that the end and intent of mini&s;ters going forth was to pub|li&s;h the go&s;pel, and he thought, to the more the better; I let him know that it was nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e who were called to the work of the mini&s;try, to know al&s;o to whom they were called, or other|wi&s;e they might be mi&s;taken, and go north in&s;tead of &s;outh, or to a different nation or country; he an&s;wered, that he believed if they were rightly cal|led, the &s;pirit would inform them where they were to go; I replied very well, and when they are come to the right place, the &s;pirit would let them know what they have to do, he &s;aid, I believe &s;o too. Whereupon I told him, if I knew the language of that &s;pirit that called me from my native land to Old-England, it was the &s;ame that inclined me to &s;ee the friends of that town by them&s;elves, and af|terwards if I felt an enlargement of mind, could have propo&s;ed a public meeting with the town's-peo|ple in the evening; and why not one opportunity for both? he queried, adding "for I &s;hould be willing that all the town might hear what thou can&s;t have to &s;ay us." I then &s;aid to him, "if a certain great per&s;on on whom thy pro&s;perity in all things tempo|ral did ab&s;olutely depend, &s;hould in &s;ingular kind|ne&s;s to thee, &s;end a me&s;&s;enger to acquaint or advi&s;e thee of &s;ome matter relating to thy&s;elf in thy own particular conduct, in which thy pro&s;perity, peace, and intere&s;t would, without thy immediate care, be nearly affected, would&s;t thou judge it prudent to &s;ay to the amba&s;&s;ador of &s;uch a friend, deliver not thy me&s;&s;age to me, until I call my neighbours and the people of the town to hear it, and &s;o expo&s;e thy own weakne&s;s to thy di&s;advantage, without be|nefit to thy neighbours? con&s;ider it carefully, my

heart yearns to the profe&s;&s;ors of truth in this town, and it &s;eems to me that my bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent was only with them, and as I can't have an opportunity according to my freedom and de&s;ire, I &s;hall hold my&s;elf excu&s;ed:" He an&s;wered, if nothing but a meeting with friends will do, we mu&s;t &s;end them word to come together as &s;oon as they can; I told him, that would now by no means do; for he was at pre&s;ent &s;o chafed in his mind, that he could not hear to much advantage; he then a&s;ked me what end would be an&s;wered by my coming there? I told him, to detect &s;uch heady un&s;ound members as he was, that thought it di&s;honourable for a few friends to meet together to wor&s;hip God, tho' their number was more than two or three, to whom the promi&s;e was; he &s;aid, then what will become of the meeting? I let him know he mu&s;t look to that, who had without orders headily appointed it, and &s;o left him; and went to Mildenhall, where a friend told me, that he being at the meeting afore&s;aid when public notice was given, that it was on this wi&s;e, Friends and Neighbours! "Plea&s;e to take notice that a friend from America de&s;ires, a public meeting here on wedne&s;day next, at &s;ix o'clock in the evening," which circum&s;tance I did not know when I was at his hou&s;e; on the whole I had inward peace in my ob&s;ervations and conduct to this man, and many friends rejoiced; for &s;everal had been overborn by him to their grief, and I was &s;ince informed, that he &s;ome what laid the matter to heart, and was often heard to &s;ay, that he would not &s;erve any friend &s;o again; after which we had many meetings in this county, and pa&s;&s;ing into Cambridge&s;hire had eight meetings therein, and I thought the life of religion was low in general, tho' there are a few tender friends in &s;everal places; we then went to divers meetings in Huntingdon&s;hire, Northampton|&s;hire, Bedford&s;hire, and Hertford&s;hire, in which it

with my brother to &s;ome adjacent meetings, but I &s;taid the week day meeting in this town, which was through Divine favour &s;atisfactory. We met again at the yearly-meeting at Norwich in a few days, which concluded to &s;atisfaction, and friends were made truly thankful to the Lord for this additional favour; we &s;pent a few days longer at this city, and attended their monthly meeting; after which, hav|ing a de&s;ire to vi&s;it a few meetings in company with my brother W^m^. Brown where Ranteri&s;m &s;eemed to prevail, he having the like concern, we took a monthly meeting at Wimondham, al&s;o the meetings at Mat&s;&s;il and Ellingham, in which we were con|cerned to u&s;e great plainne&s;s to clear our&s;elves on account of that ranting &s;pirit; then went to Ware|ham, and had a precious meeting with the few friends of that place, and to a very large general meeting at Downham, many of other &s;ocieties be|ing there, and it became my concern to recite the words of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, John v. 39-40. <HI>Search the Scriptures for in them, ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which te&s;tify of me, and ye will not come to me that ye might have life,</HI> from whence I had to &s;hew them the danger of tru&s;t|ing to information and knowledge, whether by reading the Scriptures, or hearing them preached, and neglecting to attend unto the in&s;peaking voice of Chri&s;t immediately in the heart, which is the only &s;ure interpreter of the &s;criptures, leading tho&s;e who attend to his in&s;truction in the &s;ure way to life eternal. Then parting with W. B. we went to Wi&s;bich, and Thornyfenn in Cambridge&s;hire, and taking divers meetings in Lincoln&s;hire, we pa&s;&s;ed into the Ea&s;t-Riding of York&s;hire, in which we had twenty four meetings, and taking eight in the county of Durham, we came to Shields in North|umberland, New-Ca&s;tle, and Alnwick Abbey, and reached Kel&s;o in Scotland on the fir&s;t of the &s;eventh

Truth is here at a low ebb, and feeling my mind not to be clear of friends in this place, I de&s;ired to have a &s;elect meeting with them, which Su&s;anna and her companion attended, and we had an opportunity of clearing our&s;elves of friends there, who had much fallen from the &s;implicity of the pure Truth, into the modes, fa&s;hions, and cu&s;toms of the world, in their dre&s;s, language, and manners, and truth own|ed our &s;ervice with a degree of its divine authori|ty; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, the God of Truth! We then went to a meeting at the hou&s;e of John Cri&s;ty, at Orm&s;ton, to which many people came and be|haved quietly, and the doctrine of Truth opened pretty freely to them; from thence to a meeting at Edinburgh, in which I had a &s;en&s;e that &s;ilence was be&s;t, apprehending the people had been too much fed with words; after &s;ometime one &s;tood up, and &s;pake of the excellence of re&s;ignation in mini&s;ters to &s;peak, or contentedly to be &s;ilent; to be any|thing, or nothing, as the Lord was plea&s;ed to or|der; but a &s;ecret di&s;tre&s;&s;ing fear attended my mind, that he was not enough inwardly engaged to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the order and motion of the Spirit of Truth, from the bu&s;y imagination and will of the creature, un&s;ubjected to the Divine Spirit; and I found a concern to &s;hew the nature of true re&s;ignation, and the low humble quiet that attended the minds of mi|ni&s;ters, or hearers, who had come to the real know|ledge of it; the de&s;ire of &s;uch was turned unto the Lord only for heavenly in&s;truction, and an inward evidence of the life and motion of Truth; for want of which, true Go&s;pel mini&s;try was &s;ometimes ob|&s;tructed, and the rea&s;on of &s;ilence not fully under|&s;tood; after I &s;at down, the &s;ame per&s;on again &s;tood up, and in a &s;low of words and a zealous tone, &s;aid,

that weakne&s;s, or the want of experience, led peo|ple to mi&s;take both their own and the condition of others; as he appeared to me to be actuated by a confident, ranting &s;pirit, my mind was greatly ex|erci&s;ed after the meeting; I remained at this place the two following days, being detained by rainy weather, and attended the meeting in the morning of fir&s;t day, at which I &s;at &s;ilent; but the &s;ame per|&s;on &s;pake &s;ometime in words very encouraging to the auditory, as if all was well with them, which tended to increa&s;e the exerci&s;e of my mind, having a very different &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate of the meeting; I again attended their meeting in the afternoon, when the &s;ame per&s;on &s;eemed as if he intended &s;oon to &s;tand up; but feeling the te&s;timony of Truth &s;trong again&s;t that forward ranting &s;pirit, and the &s;en&s;e thereof being weighty upon me, I endeavoured to keep under it in patience, and &s;oon the concern of that per&s;on began to dimini&s;h, and he to be drow&s;y, after which I had a favourable open time to clear my mind, of the exerci&s;e that had been upon me.</P>

Then pa&s;&s;ing to Carli&s;le in Cumberland, Morehou&s;e, Scoby, Solport and Kirklington, in mo&s;t of which meetings truth &s;eemed to be profe&s;|&s;ed, but too few had the life thereof in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which occa&s;ions hard dry meeetings. We rode to Cornwood in Northumberland, and lodged at the hou&s;e of a man who had been for &s;everal years of a di&s;orderly conduct, and much given to the exce&s;|&s;ive u&s;e of &s;trong drink, until he had very much impaired his con&s;titution, but it plea&s;ed the Lord to open his under&s;tanding, and make him acquainted with his ble&s;&s;ed Truth, whereby he was made free from that evil, and received &s;trength to for&s;ake his old companions; but his joining with friends was a great grief to his wife, who informed me, that thro' prejudice for a time, &s;he would rather he had continued his former cour&s;e of living than to be|come a Quaker, until ob&s;erving the &s;weetne&s;s of his temper and the recovery of his health in &s;ome degree, with a &s;olid and &s;ober conduct, &s;he was reached, and made to believe in the power by which he had known &s;uch a victory, and joined her&s;elf in the &s;ame religious profe&s;&s;ion; they ap|peared to be &s;teady friends: I would to God, that all tipplers and drunkards would turn to that great prophet which is in I&s;rael, that they might by him be clean&s;ed from that lepro&s;y of &s;in! We had a comfortable meeting the next day in his hou&s;e, with his neighbours and &s;ome friends; and on fir&s;t day were at Allondale meeting, where are &s;ome &s;olid friends, tho' others much tainted with a &s;pirit of Ranteri&s;m, which is a confident, &s;elf righteous &s;pirit and very hard to be won upon: After having a meeting at Ald&s;tinmoor, we pa&s;&s;ed to the meet|ings at Penrith in Cumberland, Terril, and Strick|land which is in a corner of We&s;tmoreland; it was with &s;ome difficulty we had the meeting at Terril, a man of that place &s;aying, he thought it needle&s;s,

Having meetings at divers places in the week following, I travelled in great pain and angui&s;h of mind, from a &s;en&s;e of the pre|valence of a dark, dei&s;tical &s;pirit over many of the profe&s;&s;ors of truth, of which concern the Lord was plea&s;ed to give me &s;trength and under&s;tanding to clear my&s;elf both in public and private; there is no power but his, that can enable his &s;ervants to do his work, and is over all the powers of &s;atan. On the next fir&s;t day we were at Holme meeting; in the forenoon I &s;at &s;ilent, one of the &s;tock of the old Ranters was there and very trouble&s;ome, accu&s;|ing many friends, no doubt fal&s;ely, and in the af|ternoon meeting I had not much to &s;ay, believing that old ranting &s;pirit is rather fed with words and and delights in contention, but found it my place to exhort friends to retire deeply inward in all their meetings, humbly waiting to be admitted into the heavenly pre&s;ence, to know their place of feeding to be out of the reach of &s;uch ranting &s;pirits; for if they &s;uffered their own &s;pirits to ri&s;e or re&s;ent their ill u&s;age, the meeting would be the more di&s;|quieted. Our next meetings were at Allonby and Broughton, from whence I went home with our friend Chri&s;topher Wil&s;on to his hou&s;e at Gray&s;o|then, and the next day attended the burial of a young man at Pard&s;ay Hall, and the day following the burial of a young woman at the &s;ame place, both of which meetings were very large and &s;olid, and I hope thro' divine goodne&s;s profitable to ma|ny.

at two meetings at Whitehaven, in both which I had &s;ome &s;ervice under the influence and owning of truth: We put up our hor&s;es at a friend's hou&s;e who had been u&s;ed to lodge public friends, but I was not free to tarry there, being burthened with his conduct in the manner of his entertainment, which was even to &s;uperfluity and grandeur, no way becoming the &s;implicity of truth; &s;o after &s;hewing my di&s;like therewith I went to the hou&s;e of John Harris at Highfield, his wife being with us, and re&s;ted there a day, the weather being ex|ceeding rainy; then going to the meetings at Coc|kermouth, I&s;el, and Gray&s;othen, we returned to Cockermouth and had a meeting with friends by them&s;elves, that is, without giving public notice, which was thro' Divine favour to good &s;atisfaction; re&s;ting another day with our friend John Harris, we went to meetings at Pard&s;ay Hall, and at Ke&s;|wick, at which la&s;t I was concerned to exhort the few friends there to keep up their week day meet|ing, having a fear they were very &s;lack on that account; we lodged at an Inn, where we had the company of &s;ome of tho&s;e friends, and in particu|lar one who was a public friend; &s;ome of them &s;aid, if he would attend the week day meeting, they believed the re&s;t of them would; which gave me occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve to him, that he did not ex|ample well, and ought to be more careful, as he had a public te&s;timony to bear for Truth; he re|plied, that he was obliged to be indu&s;trious to &s;up|port his family; but at la&s;t confe&s;&s;ed, that, "He did not like to &s;it with &s;o few friends, for none el&s;e would come on a week day, and it was very dull and poor &s;itting, and he liked to &s;it in meetings where there were many a&s;&s;embled, for then he had &s;omething to &s;ay, &s;o life did ari&s;e and all were com|forted and edified;" by which it appeared that he had greater &s;atisfaction in preaching than in humble

&s;ilent waiting to experience the wor&s;hip which is performed in Spirit and Truth, to edification and comfort; I told him that I feared he was too much a &s;tranger to pure religion and the nature of divine wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>From thence we went to Hawk&s;head, in Lanca|&s;hire, and had an evening meeting there in a friend's hou&s;e, and next day were at the Hight meeting, and then at Swarthmoor where George Fox former|ly lived, tho' it had been famous for the pro&s;perity of Truth, it is now at a low &s;tate there: We then went to Kendal in We&s;tmoreland, where we attend|ed their two meetings on the fir&s;t day of the week, and after taking &s;ome other meetings in the neigh|bourhood, returned to that town, in and about which we tarried &s;everal days, and vi&s;ited more than twenty families and attended ten public meet|ings, many of which opportunities were made pre|cious through the goodne&s;s and great conde&s;cention of our Lord and Saviour; and in the &s;chool of our friend Thomas Rebanks I had an extraordinary meeting; where many young folks not of our &s;oci|ety were reached by the power of Truth, which was comfortably over all, prai&s;ed be the Lord for ever. In the cour&s;e of our vi&s;iting families here, during our &s;ilent &s;itting in one of them, my mind was much taken up in thinking of a watch, and the &s;everal wheels and movements thereof, until I was grieved at &s;uch trifling thoughts, as I e&s;teemed them, when &s;uddenly there appeared &s;omething in|&s;tructive therein, and I had a freedom to &s;ay, the &s;everal parts thereof &s;eemed to repre&s;ent the excel|lent inward faculties and gifts be&s;towed on man, and that tho' the wheels, &amp;c. of a watch were truly made, and placed in their proper order, there mu&s;t be a main &s;pring to give them motion, &s;o the gifts and faculties of men mu&s;t have their main &s;pring and cau&s;e of motion to every good work, a zeal to

<P>Being clear of Kendal, we took leave of friends in much affection and went to a general meeting at Brigflatts in York&s;hire, and to vi&s;it our friend Alice Alder&s;on, who had been on a religious vi&s;it in our country with Margaret Cowpland, whom we had before &s;een at Kendal where &s;he lives. Alice was glad to &s;ee us, and we found her tender in &s;pirit and &s;trong in her love to friends; after attending meetings at Ravon&s;tonedale and Gri&s;edale, we rode to our friend John Burton's, who with his compa|nion William Backhou&s;e, had al&s;o been in our coun|try on a religious vi&s;it; we rejoiced to &s;ee him and were comforted by his grave conver&s;ation and con|duct: We then went to a meeting at Dent, which was large and &s;avoured by the over&s;hadowing of Truth in a good degree, in the loving kindne&s;s of our Lord who is worthy of all prai&s;e for ever! Then taking &s;everal meetings in Lanca&s;hire and tarrying two days with our friend William Backhou&s;e, which was an acceptable re&s;t to us, the weather being ve|ry cold, the ways bad and we weary, we came to Lanca&s;ter, and had an opportunity of vi&s;iting our friend Lydia Lanca&s;ter, who &s;everal years pa&s;t had vi&s;ited our country; her faculties of mind and love to friends appeared fre&s;h and &s;trong; from thence attending divers other meetings in that county, we went to our friend Samuel Fothergill's at Warring|ton, where we continued from the &s;econd to the fourteenth of the fir&s;t month (New-&s;tile) 1752, he

After many other meetings in this coun|ty and York&s;hire, we reached Richmond and had a meeting with friends there, and next morning &s;et forward with a guide for Ma&s;ham, in order to at|tend a meeting there, of which friends had previ|ous notice, the di&s;tance was near &s;ixteen miles, the days &s;hort, and roads deep and miry; after we had rode five or &s;ix miles, I de&s;ired our guide to mend his pace, fearing we &s;hould be late; a little further we came to a place where the roads parted, and he taking the left hand I became unea&s;y, and a&s;ked him if he perfectly knew the way; he &s;aid, he thought he did, I let him know my being in doubt about it, and de&s;ired him to inquire of a man we &s;aw in a field at &s;ome di&s;tance; but he rode on yet fa&s;ter; when I told him that I was per&s;waded we had almo&s;t turned our backs on the way we &s;hould go, at which he &s;miled; when we had gone about a mile, &s;eeing a man by the way &s;ide at work, I a&s;ked him if that was the way to Ma&s;ham, he re|plied, nay, for you have left it and mu&s;t go back unle&s;s your hor&s;es can leap over ditches very well, you may then &s;ave a mile, and pointing over a field &s;hewed us a moor, on the other &s;ide whereof our right road was; our guide &s;et forward, we followed with &s;ome difficulty over the ditches, and he rode on a gallop and &s;oon left us; my mind inclined me to vary from his cour&s;e and e&s;pying a gate, called to him, pointing to it and proceeded thither, on which he turned and came up, but &s;aid he believed we were wrong; I let him know that my mind was ea&s;y to go that way, and in a while we came into a road at a public hou&s;e, which he knew to be right, &s;o we ju&s;t reached the meeting in time, which through

Divine favour was profitable and edifying. I men|tion this pa&s;&s;age with no other view than to encou|rage friends to be inward in their minds, and to regard the &s;ecret &s;en&s;e which the pure Spirit of Truth &s;ometimes gives on particular occa&s;ions, for want of an inward &s;tillne&s;s and attention thereunto, the way is often mi&s;&s;ed in more re&s;pects than one.</P>

<P>From Ma&s;ham we proceeded to vi&s;it many other meetings in this county, in the cour&s;e whereof we called to &s;ee good old John Richard&s;on, who was &s;trong in &s;pirit tho' feeble in body, and nearly blind through age, being about eighty &s;even; and finding a draught to vi&s;it friends once more at Scar|borough, we were there on fir&s;t day the fifteenth of the third month, and had peace in my own mind, having done what I thought was my duty; but from a &s;en&s;e of the prevalence of pride, which had occa&s;ioned a great poverty as to true religion among the profe&s;&s;ors of truth in that place, I left them with an aching heart, and went on our jour|ney in order to attend the quarterly-meeting at York, taking meetings in our way at Pickering, Thornton in the Clay, and Huby. The &s;everal &s;ittings of this quarterly meeting were in the main &s;atisfactory, but not having time fully to clear my|&s;elf, did not leave York quite ea&s;y; after which, having meetings at Clifforth, Leeds, Gilder&s;ham, Bradford, Rawden, A&s;quith, Fairfield, Keighley, Skipton and Lother&s;dale, we rode to Settle, and then to attend the quarterly meeting at Lanca&s;ter, which began on the fifth day of the week with a meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, and was comfortable; next day was the meeting for public wor&s;hip and the di&s;cipline, wherein we were made to rejoice toge|ther

<P>My mind had been for &s;ometime drawn towards Ireland, and being de&s;irous to lo&s;e no time, we went to Whitehaven, &s;everal ve&s;&s;els being there nearly laden with coals for Dublin; but on viewing the &s;hips accompanied by &s;everal friends from Gray|&s;othen, I had no freedom to take a pa&s;&s;age in either of them, at which I was much &s;traitened, and in|wardly turning my mind, Ireland was hid from my view, and going to the hou&s;e of a friend we &s;at a while &s;till, and I had freedom to let friends know that I had no pro&s;pect but the ve&s;&s;els might go their voyage with &s;afety, and did not decline a pa&s;&s;age on that account; but feeling a full &s;top in my mind, had no freedom to proceed any where at pre&s;ent, &s;ave to return with our friends John and Hannah Harris to Highfield; we therefore returned with them, and attended Pard&s;ay Hall monthly-meeting, where I had freedom to propo&s;e that friends would enter on the &s;ervice of vi&s;iting families; they in|formed me that &s;ome years before they had nomi|nated friends for that &s;ervice, but meeting with &s;ome di&s;couragement they had not performed it, and being about to turn over the book to &s;ee who were then appointed, con&s;idering it was a long time &s;ince, they concluded it was better to proceed to a new choice, but &s;eemed at a &s;tand about naming

they were, already much affected, but as I had not received information, more or le&s;s, I might be mi&s;taken, and did not de&s;ire they &s;hould &s;ay any thing on the &s;ubject before me, but hone&s;tly confer on it between them&s;elves fir&s;t, and if it was &s;o, re|move the cau&s;e, and if nothing was ami&s;s then to let me know, that I might be warned to be more cautious in future; upon which I left them, and walked by my&s;elf about an hour, when the man of the hou&s;e called me in, and they told me, that I was not mi&s;taken, for that there had been an hard|ne&s;s &s;ub&s;i&s;ting for &s;ometime, which they hoped was now done away; but when in the cour&s;e of our vi&s;it, we came to the hou&s;e of the friends who had been unea&s;y, I felt it as fre&s;h as before, and told them I did believe they were not ea&s;y that the friend &s;hould go on in the &s;ervice; to which one of them an&s;wered, if &s;he judges her&s;elf to be clear and others are ea&s;y, I have no objection; whereupon I a&s;ked what others were meant; the man replied, her hu&s;band and relations; and as the matter re&s;ted upon me, it appeared that endeavours ought to be u&s;ed for reconciliation before we could with &s;atis|faction proceed on our vi&s;it, and believing that the Lord had &s;ecretly engaged me, I hoped he would accompany and ble&s;s the labour for the re&s;toration of peace, which in a few days he was plea&s;ed to accompli&s;h, and then we proceeded more cheerful|ly, and I think I may &s;ay that the Lord was with us, to the prai&s;e of his great eternal name, who is worthy for ever.</P>

<P>Then taking meetings at Toberhead, Charle|mont, and Ballyhagan, we attended the men's meeting at Lurgan, having a great de&s;ire to &s;it with friends there in the management of their di&s;cipline, which was adjourned to this time at my reque&s;t; it began with a meeting for wor&s;hip, men and women being generally together, at the conclu&s;ion of which, the men went into the room where the meeting for bu&s;ine&s;s was u&s;ually held, when after &s;itting &s;ometime in &s;ilence, a leading friend &s;aid, "This is only an adjourned meeting, and bid the clerk enter it and they might adjourn to the u&s;ual time to do their bu&s;ine&s;s, when it would be more &s;elect;" and the meeting &s;itting a while without proceeding any way, I a&s;ked them what was meant by the words, more &s;elect, and further &s;aid, if any per&s;ons were pre&s;ent that had not a right to &s;it there, they &s;hould withdraw, they knew their own mem|bers; if they meant the friend who came with us, he was a neighbouring friend and an elder; and as for my&s;elf, I e&s;teemed my&s;elf a proper member of their meeting, as I came to vi&s;it them with the con|currence of my brethren at home, and had certifi|cates from them, wherein I was recommended to friends in Europe and el&s;e where, and if I did any thing among them worthy of cen&s;ure, I &s;hould &s;ub|mit to their dealing, and therefore de&s;ired them to go on with their bu&s;ine&s;s, for I had come thither with a concern to &s;ee how the affairs of the church went on; &s;o without more debate or much reply they proceeded, and to my &s;urprize, things of di&s;|order

had lain &s;everal years without proper dealing with various offenders, &s;uch as drinkers of healths, &s;ome that had been at cockfightings and races, and one or more marriages out of the order of truth; which gave me an opportunity to clear my&s;elf fully of the concern that had for &s;ome days lain with weight on my mind, which I believe was accepta|ble to &s;ome &s;ecretly pained friends, however con|trary to &s;ome others; &s;o that I left the place with a peaceful mind, and thankful to the Lord who had given me an innocent boldne&s;s to a&s;&s;ert my right of member&s;hip; for I believe if we had not been there, the meeting would have been thought &s;elect.</P>
<P>We then went to Ul&s;ter Province-meeting at Bal|lyhagan which held two days, the elders and other concerned friends here inquire into the &s;tate of things among their members in the province, and it was in the main a &s;atisfactory meeting; from hence we went Southward, taking meetings at Ca&s;tle&s;hane, Coothill, Ballyhais, and Old Ca&s;tle, and to Ballymurry in Connaught, having a meeting in a barn at Gailey with a few friends, it being the only one kept up in that provice, except at Athlone, which we likewi&s;e attended, and came to James Clibborn's at the Moat of Granoge, where we al&s;o had a meeting; altho' I had travelled every day for more than a week with a fever on me and had eaten little, occa&s;ioned as I thought by a cold taken by laying in damp beds, and was now very unwell, but &s;at the fir&s;t day meeting; next day my illne&s;s became very violent, &s;o that friends thought I &s;hould lay my body there, and &s;ent for an apothecary who let me blood, which &s;omewhat allayed the fever and I fell into a &s;leep, when I began to bleed again, which brought me very weak, that I was awakened at midnight with great drops of &s;weat on my face, and &s;ickne&s;s; and calling my companion who watch|ed with me, we found that I had bled much, the
<PB N="121" REF="016223_0127_0F9BD2AC61CFA3C0">
orifice in my arm being very large and not carefully bound up; my kind landlord and his wife being anxious about me, had prevailed with the apothecary to lodge in the hou&s;e, who being called to me, on his coming. I de&s;ired him to peel a bladder and ap|ply a thin piece of it about as broad as a half-penny on the wound; he a&s;ked for what; I told him he would &s;ee, and when it was applied I reque&s;ted him to hold his finger on the piece over the orifice &s;o as to &s;top the blood, until the plai&s;ter dried and &s;tuck, which it &s;oon did and it bled no more; he &s;aid that he had not &s;een the like. I mention this for the &s;ake of others, for the bladder &s;ticks as the blood under it dries, and will &s;top the bleeding of almo&s;t any wound. Next morning a graduate phy&s;ician of the town came to vi&s;it me, and feeling my pul&s;e, I a&s;ked him what he thought of me? He making no an&s;wer, I &s;aid be not afraid to tell me, for I am not afraid to hear; he replied, "that is happy for you," by which I &s;uppo&s;ed he thought I &s;hould not recover; he viewed my &s;pittle and &s;aid I was in a deep con&s;umption, and propo&s;ed my taking a vo|mit; I told him that I had not taken one many years, be&s;ides as he judged my lungs were inflam|ed, a moderate purge was better; at which he re|plied with an air of banter, "you are an odd pati|ent, come, you &s;hall be phy&s;ician and I will be apo|thecary;" I took him at his word and he &s;ent me a purge which gave me &s;ome relief; he vi&s;ited me daily for a week, and could hardly believe I &s;hould recover, tho' I told him I believed that I &s;hould, he &s;till judged my cough to be con&s;umptive, and at length told me, if I did recover to go home as &s;oon as I could, for that the Lord was more merci|ful than to require &s;uch an one as I was to travel as I did, and that I had already acted as a mad man to travel &s;o long time with that fever before I lay by; I a&s;ked him, if he was ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el at &s;ea

which had &s;prang a leak that could not be &s;topped, what he would do? he replied, endeavour to make to the next port for a dry dock to unlade and &s;earch out the leak; why doctor &s;aid I, this is ju&s;t my ca&s;e, I &s;aw no place to lay by until I came hither, at which he laughed, and wi&s;hed me well; I think I never was reduced to &s;o weak a &s;tate in &s;o &s;hort a time, which might be occa&s;ioned by my great lo&s;s of blood; but the Lord was plea&s;ed to heal me, that I gathered &s;trength to admiration, and on fir&s;t day &s;at the meeting, which was comfortable, and continuing to recover tho' not fit to travel, I tarried until fourth day and attended their monthly meet|ing, and under&s;tanding they had been endeavour|ing to vi&s;it families, but were backward in begin|ning, I told friends that I had a freedom to accom|pany them in the work for a few days for their en|couragement, and we accordingly went with them to a few places to good &s;atisfaction, and friends received &s;trength to go on with the &s;ervice. Then taking an affectionate leave of our kind landlord James Clibborn, and his wife who is grand-daughter to Robert Barclay the apologi&s;t, we went to meet|ings at Birr, Kilconnermoor, Ca&s;hell, Killcommon, Clon&s;mell, Youghall, and &s;o to Cork on the fir&s;t day of the week, where we al&s;o attended the men's meeting for di&s;cipline, and vi&s;ited the women's meeting, which were both to &s;ome good &s;atisfac|tion; then going to Bandon, we returned to an appointed meeting at Cork for parents and their children, and having &s;trength given me to clear my&s;elf, it was, I hope profitable to many, being a large meeting; we then went to Malo, and had a &s;ea&s;onable opportunity with a family of friends, thence to the Province-meeting for Mun&s;ter held at Limerick, the public and &s;elect &s;ittings of which and for the di&s;cipline ended comfortably; and after attending the week day meeting, we went to a

meeting at Ro&s;s, and returned to Limerick, and being unwell with a cold we tarried their meetings on fir&s;t day, which were large and &s;atisfactory, and in the evening had one with a &s;ick friend; being clear, and taking three meetings in our way, we proceeded to Lein&s;ter Province-meeting at Mountmelick, which began on the &s;ixth day of the week with a meeting of mini&s;ters, the next day for wor&s;hip and the di&s;cipline, and on fir&s;t day morn|ing was a large and precious meeting, in the after|noon the town's people came in and it was a good &s;atisfactory meeting, tho' not &s;o large, friends be|ing mo&s;tly gone home. We had a meeting next day at Tullamoor, and returning to Mountmelic had a &s;atisfactory one with the children in the &s;chool of James Gough; after the week day meeting in this town we went to Ballacarrol, Ballanakel and Cooperhill, having a meeting at each; then to Catherlough monthly meeting on fir&s;t day, and the next day to Athy, then to Ballitore which was through Divine Goodne&s;s attending, made profita|ble, and we had al&s;o a &s;atisfactory meeting with the &s;cholars in Abraham Shackleton's &s;chool; after a meeting at Newton we went to Samuel Wat&s;on's at Killconner, who&s;e wife (late Abigail Bowles) had been on a religious vi&s;it in America &s;everal years pa&s;t, &s;he was now near her end, but &s;en&s;ible and in a good frame of &s;pirit, and greatly rejoiced to &s;ee us, and we were mutually comforted in a &s;en&s;e of the Lord's pre&s;ence, for which his holy name was prai&s;ed; after a meeting here and another at Cather|lough we went to Waterford, and &s;at with friends in their morning, afternoon, and evening meetings on the fir&s;t day, in all which having cleared my|&s;elf hone&s;tly, my &s;pirit mourned under a &s;en&s;e of formality among the people, and a deadne&s;s to the pure inward life of religion; then taking meetings at Ro&s;s, Lamb&s;town, Wexford, Randals-mills or

Ca&s;tle&s;aw, Cooladine, and &s;everal other places we came to Wicklow, at which meeting many &s;oldiers attended who behaved well, and truth owned the &s;ervice in a good degree. I have ob&s;erved where the &s;oldiers came into our meetings, they were an awe to the rabble and loo&s;e people, who are &s;ometimes apt to be rude; from hence we went to Dublin in order to attend the national half-years-meeting, and were kindly received by our old landlord Samuel Judd and his family.</P>
<P>Lein&s;ter Province-meeting began on &s;econd day the &s;ixth of the eleventh month, both for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, and on third day the national meet|ing, which held four days; the &s;everal &s;ittings there|of being in general attended with a &s;en&s;e of Divine Goodne&s;s, and the te&s;timony of Truth ran &s;trong again&s;t hypocri&s;y, covetou&s;ne&s;s, libertini&s;m, and pride among the profe&s;&s;ors thereof; but in a con&s;o|latory &s;tream to the humble and contrite children of the family, in a thankful &s;en&s;e whereof the name of the Lord was prai&s;ed, who is worthy for ever and ever! We tarried a few days longer with friends in Dublin, and then went to meetings at Baltiboys, Timahoe, Rathangan, and Edenderry, and a religious &s;itting in John Pim's family at Nurney, then returning to Edenderry attended their monthly-meeting, where having a concern to vi&s;it &s;ome families of friends, we went to mo&s;t of them in that town and to the hou&s;e of a widow in the country, where we had a good opportunity with her and her children; I a&s;ked the friend who ac|companied us, whether there was any other friend's hou&s;e to which we had not been; he &s;aid he thought not; but my mind had a draught to &s;ome hou&s;e and I pointed toward it, he then &s;aid he believed he knew where; &s;o we went to the place, and the family being called together, I inquired whether there was not another belonging to the hou&s;e, and was told

there was; as &s;oon as he came, I knew it was the man whom my mind was concerned to vi&s;it, and &s;omething I had to expre&s;s reached and tendered him very much, he being exceeding wild and fa&s;hi|onable and did not love to attend religious meet|ings, but truth now reached him; on the fir&s;t day following I &s;aw him at Edenderry meeting, where the vi&s;itation &s;eemed to be renewed to him; I af|terwards heard that he continued to be &s;ober and thoughtful, and I was thankful to the Lord that he was plea&s;ed to conde&s;cend in mercy to gather the out|ca&s;t of I&s;rael. Being clear of this place, I returned to Dublin, and having a concern on my mind to vi&s;it the families of &s;ome who made profe&s;&s;ion of truth but were di&s;orderly in their conduct, we began that &s;ervice, being accompanied by &s;everal friends, and the Lord was plea&s;ed to own the work. During our &s;tay we were careful to attend all the meetings in this city for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, one of which was a quarterly-meeting for the youth, in which many were tendered by the love of God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord and Saviour. We vi|&s;ited about &s;ixty families, in mo&s;t whereof the Lord was plea&s;ed to favour with authority to &s;et the te&s;ti|mony of truth over the heads of the corrupt, di&s;|orderly profe&s;&s;ors, and to influence with under|&s;tanding to divide the word and coun&s;el of truth to the different &s;tates of tho&s;e we vi&s;ited; in an hum|ble &s;en&s;e whereof, let my &s;oul obey and adore him who is alone worthy for ever!</P>
<P>As I apprehended the women's meeting to be &s;lack of doing their part of duty as true helps in the exerci&s;e of the di&s;cipline, and a proper care over the flock and family of the Lord, a weighty concern attended me to expre&s;s in writing my &s;en&s;e of what was the proper bu&s;ine&s;s belonging to wo|men's meetings, which I &s;hewed to the men friends, and had their concurrence to lay it before the wo|men's

meeting in order for their encouragement and practice in the wi&s;dom of Truth, and it was afterwards &s;ent to the women's meetings through|out the nation.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;el in which we came to Ireland being ready to &s;ail, and the ma&s;ter de&s;irous of our com|pany to return with him, I felt &s;o clear and ea&s;y that I intended to go; but when he &s;ent us word to come on board, I was more inclined to &s;tay that day, and went to meeting, being fir&s;t day, and he &s;ailed; but meeting with contrary winds and dark weather, was obliged to put back into Dublin har|bour after about a week's fatigue; my being with|held from embarking, I thought was a remarka|ble kindne&s;s and favour from my great and good Ma&s;ter; prai&s;ed be his name! we had afterwards &s;everal good meetings, in &s;ome of which it became my concern to recommend &s;ilence by example, of which they &s;tood in much need; and on the twenty-third of the fir&s;t month (1753,) after having tra|velled in Ireland thirteen hundred and fifteen miles, and had one hundred and thirty-four meetings, be|&s;ides many family vi&s;its, feeling my mind to be fully clear, we went on board a &s;hip of Whitehaven, Allen Wil&s;on ma&s;ter, having in much love taken leave of our friends; and after a &s;hort, but &s;tormy rough pa&s;&s;age of about twenty-three hours, arrived at Whitehaven with hearts humbly thankful to the Lord who had pre&s;erved us; the ma&s;ter &s;aying, that he had not known the like for twelve years, altho' he had &s;ailed between the two ports very con&s;tantly. Next day after our arrival, our friend John Harris of Highfield, with whom we had left our hor&s;es, brought them to us and we went home with him, and vi&s;iting the meetings in the neigh|bourhood, &s;everal of which, particularly the la&s;t at Pard&s;ay Hall, were large and precious opportu|nities, and I thought I could perceive that my for|mer

painful labours among them had been ble&s;&s;ed, for which I was truly thankful to the holy head of the church and ma&s;ter of the a&s;&s;emblies of his peo|ple. From thence we went to Lortonhall and had an evening meeting with the people of the town, to which came the prie&s;t and mo&s;t of his hearers, and altho' the craft and conduct of the hirelings were much &s;et forth, all was quiet and it ended well.</P>
<P>From thence we went to Kendal and &s;taying a general meeting there, proceeded to divers others in York&s;hire, and Lanca&s;hire, and to one we had appointed at Coln, where are no members of our &s;ociety, and tho' a poor dark town in re&s;pect to re|ligion, the people behaved &s;oberly, and many were tendered by the gentle, yet powerful reaches of Heavenly goodne&s;s; and I may &s;ay, that in riding through &s;ome towns in England where no friend dwelt, I felt a &s;ecret &s;alutation of love to the inha|bitants, tho' as a &s;eed yet ungathered; but my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s in general was to the children of the family, that when it &s;hall plea&s;e the Lord to open the eyes of others to behold Zion, no &s;tumbling block might appear to offend the beholders, or dim her heavenly beauty.</P>
<P>From hence pa&s;&s;ing to Halifax we had a large open meeting there, and divers others in York&s;hire, until we came to our friend John Ha&s;lam's at Han&s;|worth-Woodhou&s;e, then to Sheffield, where we vi|&s;ited &s;ome families to our &s;atisfaction, and after at|tending two meetings in Derby&s;hire returned to J. Ha&s;lam's, and again to Sheffield, and &s;at their morn|ing meeting on fir&s;t day, and in the afternoon at|tended the burial of Ellen Atwick, a friend of good repute, to which many people came and I had a favourable opportunity; being then clear, I went to Blythe in Nottingham&s;hire and had a meeting, and &s;everal in other towns this week, and reached
<PB N="128" REF="016223_0134_0F9BD2B58D3A3330">
Rawcliff in York&s;hire on fir&s;t day; on the night before I had a dream which much affected me; "I thought I heard a kind of melody and &s;inging at my left hand, whereupon I &s;aid, What do ye rejoice at; which continuing I &s;aid, your &s;inging is &s;omewhat like David's rejoicing before the ark, but I &s;ee it not, and heard a voice on my right &s;aying, the ark is in the land of the Phili&s;tines, where it was taken through the wickedne&s;s of the prie&s;ts and &s;ins of the people, who removed the ark from Shi|loh to &s;trengthen them in battle;" whereupon I awoke and was under &s;ome exerci&s;e for a time, concluding it was ominous, but &s;aw no further, until we went to meeting in the forenoon, where I &s;oon heard a kind of tuneful &s;ighing, which kept increa&s;ing, and turning my head to di&s;cover from whence it came, found it to be at my left hand; after a while a per&s;on &s;tood up and &s;poke a few &s;entences of extraordinary enjoyments which were to be felt; my mind was pained, and after he &s;at down I &s;tood up and &s;aid, What are ye doing? and what do you feel to occa&s;ion this rejoicing? and &s;hould have pro|ceeded to have told them my thoughts, but in&s;tant|ly my dream came into my mind, and &s;o with little addition &s;at down very &s;orrowful; after the meeting I went to dinner, but could not eat much or be chearful; at the afternoon meeting we had the &s;ame tune until my &s;pirit was afflicted; but labouring to know that quiet which is not ea&s;ily di&s;turbed, I re|ceived &s;trength in a loving frame of mind to inform them, that I feared they were mi&s;taken in their &s;tates and conditions, for that death reigned, and it was rather a time of mourning: And as truth aro&s;e in &s;ome good degree, that floating formal &s;ea became dried up; and in the evening having the company of the chief &s;inger among them, I had a &s;ingular freedom &s;imply to relate my dream to him, with a de&s;ire that he might examine whether the

ark enclo&s;ing the pure te&s;timony was pre&s;erved &s;afe among&s;t them; which &s;hut up further conver&s;ation. In a few days after, an intimate friend a&s;ked me how I fared there, I repeated to him my dream, and he told me it was very &s;ignificant, for that a withering had taken place in that meeting, and that per&s;on had &s;everal children who were married to &s;uch that did not profe&s;s with us, and being treated with as a parent, he &s;aid it might be a means of increa&s;ing the meeting, if tho&s;e they had married came to meeting with them, and di&s;couraged friends from dealing with them, le&s;t it &s;hould prevent them.</P>
<P>Then taking a meeting at Selby, we proceeded to the quarterly-meeting at York, which continued two days, and was a good meeting; here we met my brother W^m^. Brown to our mutual comfort af|ter a &s;eparation of nineteen months; we &s;oon parted again, he going towads Lanca&s;ter and we to &s;everal meetings in York&s;hire and &s;ome in Lincoln&s;hire; in &s;ome places I ob&s;erved the form to remain and life to be wanting, and in others the profe&s;&s;ors of truth are too generally declined from both; true life gives birth to a true form; but the mere form will never produce the life of Truth. From hence we went to Retford and Mansfield, in Nottingham|&s;hire, and at the la&s;t town had two meetings, one of which was with friends by them&s;elves; for it did not always appear convenient to deliver too public|ly, tho&s;e things which tended to the reproof of &s;ome di&s;orderly walkers in the family, le&s;t it &s;hould rather harden than re&s;tore and heal, e&s;pecially where their conduct did not occa&s;ion open reproach; then taking a meeting at Broughton we went to Notting|ham, and had three meetings there on fir&s;t day, and the next at Oxham with a few friends who were glad thereof, being &s;ometimes mi&s;&s;ed by tra|vellers; the day following we had an appointed meeting at Nottingham to &s;atisfaction; in this place

they are troubled with &s;ome ranters, who force them&s;elves into meetings for di&s;cipline: Friends were exhorted to keep up the te&s;timony of Truth in the meek humble &s;pirit thereof, in which its do|minion will &s;tand for ever; we then &s;pent &s;ome time in vi&s;iting many meetings in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, taking one at Oakham in Rutland&s;hire, where &s;ome inno|cent friends live, and I think it is the only meeting of friends in that county; at Bo&s;well&s;treet we had a meeting with &s;ome who had been lately con|vinced, but had not yet known a true e&s;tabli&s;hment in humbly waiting for the power of Truth, to give a &s;olid growth in pure religion; the &s;ame evening we had a meeting at Coventry to good &s;atisfaction; and the week following came to Dudley in Worce&s;|ter&s;hire, where we lodged at James Payton's, who&s;e &s;i&s;ter Catharine was preparing to go on a religious vi&s;it to America; &s;taying the meeting on fir&s;t day in Dudley, we went to divers others in this county and Warwick&s;hire, and came to Eaden in Nor|thampton&s;hire, at which meeting many people came, &s;ome of whom were very unruly, but the power of Truth prevailing, it ended quietly, prai&s;ed be the Lord who is all&s;ufficient for his own work! vi&s;iting &s;everal other meetings in this county, at one of them held in an evening at Chipping-Norton there where many tender young people, to whom I felt a &s;alutation in the love of Truth; but before I thought it &s;afe for me to &s;tand up, a young man not much like a friend &s;tood up, and began to exhort them to be faithful in di&s;charging what&s;oever the Lord required of them, and how eminently he would be with, and qualify them for his work, as tho' they were all appointed to enter upon &s;ome extraordi|nary great &s;ervice; at which my mind was much grieved, for I thought it would be more &s;uitable for them deeply to retire and wait for the virtue of Truth and &s;ap of life, to experience a growth

truth &s;eemed to be over us, after which our inter|preter had &s;omething further to &s;ay; I have often lamented the increa&s;e of words, and a repetition of former experiences without the renewing of life, which di&s;po&s;ition &s;eems to prevail in too many, to the burdening of &s;en&s;ible members in our &s;ociety.</P>
<P>As we &s;at this evening in a friends hou&s;e at Twi&s;k two elderly women came in, profe&s;&s;ors of truth but very talkative: I had &s;een them &s;everal times before, and as often been burdened with them, and now had &s;omething in particular to &s;peak; but feared that &s;uch plain dealing would be too &s;trong for our interpreter, who appeared to be very &s;ociable with them; therefore I delivered my mind without &s;in|gling them out, &s;everal others being pre&s;ent; the&s;e women took it to them&s;elves, but not in &s;uch a di&s;|po&s;ition as I de&s;ired, being di&s;turbed, and follow|ing us to our lodgings made their complaint to our interpreter, bidding him a&s;k me if I took them to be &s;uch per&s;ons as I had de&s;cribed; if &s;o, they de|&s;ired to know what I had to accu&s;e them with? at fir&s;t it put me to a &s;tand, but being &s;till, I &s;oon thought it was providential, that they thus gave me an opportunity to clear my&s;elf of the burden I had borne on their account, and told them, that to enter into particular charges was not my bu&s;i|ne&s;s, but was free to let them know that I had been in pain on their account from the fir&s;t time I &s;aw them, and that if I had a true &s;en&s;e of their &s;tates, they were not &s;uch as they ought to be, but had lo&s;t the favour of what they profe&s;&s;ed to enjoy, and could &s;o freely talk of, "and told one of them that I took her to be dark and ignorant of her own &s;tate; and the other, that &s;he was too light and chaffy in her &s;pirit, and that they both wanted the true cloathing of the Lord's children, which is humility of heart and reverence of &s;pirit, which would &s;ea&s;on all their conver&s;ation and conduct,

that they would not be &s;tumbling blocks to their neighbours, as I feared they were: I al&s;o told them, that I believed when I &s;pake as I did at the friend's hou&s;e it belonged to them, in which I was now confirmed, for had they been &s;incere hearted, they would have borne it without flinching; but now they had &s;hewn that their &s;ore places were touched, and I dared not to le&s;&s;en the weight of what was then &s;aid, but de&s;ired them to receive and ponder it well; for I was &s;ure it was delivered in love, and believed it to be a vi&s;itation to them in their old age." Which being interpreted to them, they &s;pake &s;omething to the interpreter which I did not under|&s;tand; then one of them &s;aid, &s;he had yet love in her heart for me: I told her that I had nothing but good will towards her, and &s;o they went away.</P>
<P>After which, the interpreter told me, he had known the&s;e women many years; that I had a true &s;en&s;e of them, and he had delivered my words ho|ne&s;tly, and hoped they would do them good.</P>
<P>We next had a meeting with friends of Twi&s;k by them&s;elves in a private hou&s;e, in which we were favoured with the &s;avour of truth, the &s;incere heart|ed being refre&s;hed, and the di&s;orderly warned to be more careful.</P>
<P>After taking &s;ome refre&s;hment, we ha&s;ted to attend another meeting appointed for us at Abby-Kirk in the afternoon, which was held in the &s;ame hou&s;e where I felt the oppo&s;ition before mentioned: I &s;oon was &s;en&s;ible of &s;ome matter in my mind to divide to the people; fir&s;t to a low afflicted &s;tate, and things opened pretty clear, and were interpret|ed readily; but proceeding to the other &s;tates, I felt the current ob&s;tructed, and the force of my &s;entences evaded, and had a &s;en&s;e that the minds of the friends of that hou&s;e were &s;hut up again&s;t what I had to deliver, &s;o I forbore going on, and the interpreter &s;oon began and continued to &s;peak
<PB N="139" REF="016223_0145_0F9BD2C404836928">
near an hour; when he had done, I felt a great weight on my mind, and de&s;ired him to interpret a few &s;entences for me, he did not &s;eem very free, &s;aying, "let it be &s;hort then," the &s;ub&s;tance was, "That I had come in love to &s;ee them, and was in no way prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or informed concerning any per&s;on or ca&s;e among them; yet found they were &s;hut up again&s;t what I had to deliver; neverthele&s;s I could not be ea&s;y without letting them know, that I did believe, unle&s;s they humbled them&s;elves, and were &s;tripped from that &s;elf-righteous wholene&s;s, wherewith they had cloathed them&s;elves, they never would grow in the life of true religion; but would be as &s;tumbling blocks to the &s;incere hearted among them," &s;o I went out of the hou&s;e and re|turned to our lodging, not having freedom to &s;tay there longer. Our interpreter who tarried with them after we were gone, told me that they judged a certain friend who had been in Holland &s;ometime before and &s;poken very clo&s;ely to them, had inform|ed me concerning them, and I thought the inter|preter al&s;o favoured that &s;entiment, which made me not to wonder at the oppo&s;ition I had felt both in him and them; whereupon I told him, that un|til that time I never knew that the friend whom they thus judged had been there, and that I had never heard of their names, nor the name of the town until I came with him, and de&s;ired him to give it in charge to a friend of Twi&s;k who was pre|&s;ent with us, to let tho&s;e friends know from me, what I then &s;aid of my innocency.</P>
<P>Feeling my&s;elf now pretty ea&s;y re&s;pecting that place we returned towards Am&s;terdam, accompani|ed by two friends to Hoorn, where no friends now live, tho' formerly there were, and &s;ometimes meetings have been held there; and I had &s;ome thoughts of having one; but being under di&s;cou|ragement, had almo&s;t concluded to proceed on our
<PB N="140" REF="016223_0146_0F9BD2C484549CB0">
way; but in walking through the city to the &s;kute, which was to &s;et off for Am&s;terdam in a few mi|nutes, I felt my mind affected with a &s;en&s;e that my great and good ma&s;ter was near, and de&s;ired with earne&s;t breathings to know his will, and if he would be plea&s;ed to be with me, I was willing to do the &s;ame, as he &s;hould require and enable me; I then felt &s;uch a &s;tream of love towards the inha|bitants, that I was convinced there was a vi&s;itation to them, as tho' the Lord would in his own time gather a people there; as yet I had not di&s;clo&s;ed my mind to any one, although I felt a draught back; when &s;eeing a young man in the &s;treet, I de&s;ired the interpreter to a&s;k him if he thought we could have a meeting in that town, to which he rea|dily an&s;wered that he believed we might, and tak|ing hold of my baggage &s;aid, if we would plea&s;e to return to his hou&s;e, he would endeavour to procure a place and acquaint the people, which he very punctually, and with great &s;peed performed, and we met about four in the afternoon at the hou&s;e of Cornelius Oly&s;lager, and had a good opportunity with a tender friendly people, &s;everal of whom were reached and tendered by the virtue and &s;avour of truth, which &s;pread freely; for which the giver of all good was reverently prai&s;ed, who is worthy for ever. The people departed in much love, and we returned to the young man's hou&s;e, where we were affectionately entertained that night; we &s;hould have been glad to have conver&s;ed with the people, but could not under&s;tand their language, yet had a &s;en&s;e that they were &s;atisfied with the meeting.</P>
<P>Being accompanied by this kind young man Dirk Me&s;chaert, our landlord, to the track-&s;kute, we took leave with tears on each &s;ide, and arriving at Am|&s;terdam, we &s;at with friends that afternoon in their week day meeting to &s;atisfaction, having travelled in North Holland about &s;eventy four miles by
<PB N="141" REF="016223_0147_0F9BD2C9C0D516C8">
boat and waggon, we then vi&s;ited the remainder of friends families in this city, and were comforted therein, the Lord being plea&s;ed to own our labour, and I pray it may be ble&s;&s;ed to them; on fir&s;t day morning we had a large &s;olid meeting, at which were &s;everal &s;trangers, particularly two young men, Italians, &s;uppo&s;ed to be princes, who behaved well, al&s;o many of the citizens who had never been at a friend's meeting before. The afternoon meeting was al&s;o large, but &s;ome of the lower &s;ort who came to gaze out of curio&s;ity, behaved rude, yet it ended better than I expected; there &s;eemed to be an openne&s;s in many to hear the te&s;timony and principle of Truth declared; but it is a dull way to &s;peak by an imperfect interpreter.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;econd of the eighth month was held what they call their yearly meeting, which was attended by &s;everal not of our &s;ociety; but it has little more than the name of a yearly-meeting, the di&s;cipline of truth being much lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Feeling &s;ome concern &s;till to continue on my mind towards the friends at Abby-Kirk where I was &s;en&s;ible of the oppo&s;ition before hinted, I had free|dom to write them a letter; but on con&s;idering that the friend and his wife to whom I wrote were per|&s;ons of note, I was fearful that their re&s;entment might hurt &s;ome others, and having a tender con|cern towards the &s;incere hearted, it was with me to prepare the way by writing an Epi&s;tle to friends of the meeting at Twi&s;k, to which tho&s;e of Abby-Kirk do al&s;o belong, both which I got a friend of Am|&s;terdam to tran&s;late; that to the meeting I &s;ent im|mediately that it might be read on a fir&s;t day, and directed the other to be &s;ent &s;oon after.</P>

<P>"Dear Friends, beware of letting out your minds after the doctrines and teachings of men, who have not the word of Life committed to them to preach in the Love and Power of Truth: For if ye do, ye will be un&s;table and wavering, and a wavering man is as a wave of the &s;ea, to&s;&s;ed to and fro with every contrary wind of doctrine; neither look you too much to the example one of another, but wait to receive in your&s;elves, a &s;en&s;e of what ye ought to do and to join with, and what ye ought to be &s;e|perated from, then will you be able to judge what you hear and &s;ee; becau&s;e you have the &s;pirit of Truth in your own hearts, for that is the true rule, judge and guide, which leads into all Truth.</P>

<P>Our dear Lord &s;aid, <HI>Learn of me, for I am meek and low of heart:</HI> His Spirit in us if we take heed thereto, will teach us to be meek and low in heart; at this day his teaching is the &s;ame, and will remain to be &s;o to all his followers forever: Oh may you be humble, for it is the humble that the
<PB N="144" REF="016223_0150_0F9BD2CD86CB3E18">
Lord doth teach of his ways; and the meek he guides in judgment: But the whole and &s;elf-right|eous, who are wi&s;e in their own eyes, and prudent in their own conceit, the Lord will hide the my&s;te|ries of his pure wi&s;dom from the&s;e; but to the babes who are truly changed, and born from above; and tho&s;e &s;ucklings who are weaned from the brea&s;ts of the world, and its wi&s;dom, and are leaning on the brea&s;t of Chri&s;t their beloved, de&s;iring the &s;incere milk of his word, that they may grow thereby; unto the&s;e the Lord will reveal true Knowledge, and Wi&s;dom from above; and that wi&s;dom is pure, peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be entreated, and tho&s;e that have the &s;ame in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they have the &s;ea&s;oning virtue of Truth; they have &s;alt in them|&s;elves, and are therefore pre&s;erved in peace and unity with the pure Truth, and al&s;o one with ano|ther; &s;uch profe&s;&s;ors who inwardly know, and receive the mo&s;t holy Faith, they know the &s;ame to work in them by love, to the purifying of their hearts: The&s;e are Jews inward, circumci&s;ed in heart, true I&s;raelites indeed, in whom there is no guile; and their righteou&s;ne&s;s exceeds that of the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees.</P>
<P>I heartily wi&s;h that you may (in your old age) be concerned to know the Life of pure Religion; a &s;en&s;e of the want thereof in your family, burthen|ed my life whil&s;t I was in your hou&s;e, which was the rea&s;on why I could not be free to eat and drink with you.</P>
<P>In order to di&s;charge my&s;elf towards you, have I written the&s;e few lines, de&s;iring that you may examine your&s;elves, and &s;ee if there be not a cau&s;e,&mdash;and in the love of Truth, which leads us to deal plainly one with another,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I remain your real Friend and Welwi&s;her, JOHN CHURCHMAN.</SIGNED>

<P><PB N="145" REF="016223_0151_0F9BD2CE405B7228">We continued with friends in this city and at|tended their two meetings on fir&s;t day, and in the evening had an opportunity with &s;everal to &s;atisfac|tion, for our love rather increa&s;ed; next morning feeling my mind clear of friends in Holland, I was ea&s;y to return towards England, and accompanied by &s;everal to the &s;kute we took leave and went to Turgow by water, from thence by waggon to Rot|terdam, in all about forty-two miles, there are no members of our &s;ociety left in this city; we went to &s;ee the meeting hou&s;e and had &s;ome thoughts of having a meeting; but being the time of a great fair, which occa&s;ioned a concour&s;e of rude people, there was no pro&s;pect of having one to advantage.</P>
<P>John Vanderwaarf jun^r^. came with us to Rot|terdam, with whom we parted in much love early on fourth day morning the twenty-ninth of the eighth month, and went on board the &s;ame &s;hip which brought us hither, it having made a voyage to England and back &s;ince; we &s;ailed with a fair wind down the Maze to the Briell before noon, when it becoming contrary, we lay at anchor until fir&s;t day morning, then proceeding, we pa&s;&s;ed over the dangerous &s;ands and &s;o to &s;ea, and arrived at Yarmouth about one the next day, and had a meet|ing with friends the &s;ame evening.</P>
<P>In this journey to Holland, we travelled by &s;ea and land about five hundred miles.</P>
<P>From Yarmouth we went in a chai&s;e to Norwich, where friends were rejoiced to &s;ee us, and we were thankful for our &s;afe return, and being concerned to &s;pend &s;ome more time among them in this city, we vi&s;ited a few families and attended their month|ly-meeting, al&s;o their two meetings on fir&s;t day, which were dull and heavy; the minds of the peo|ple being too much outward, I found it my place to recommend &s;ilence by example more than by words, in both tho&s;e meetings.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="016223_0152_0F9BD2CF829D47F0">Next day in company with other friends I went to vi&s;it Hannah Lucas, a &s;chool mi&s;tre&s;s, who was newly convinced; &s;he was in a low &s;tate of mind; our vi&s;it was to mutual &s;atisfaction, being comforted together.</P>
<P>At their week day meeting on third day, I had a &s;ea&s;onable time to di&s;charge my mind towards friends in that city, in which I was led to deal plain|ly with them: They are a loving people to &s;trangers and each other; but there is a want of weightine&s;s of &s;pirit, and of a proper care in the exerci&s;e of the di&s;cipline of the church.</P>
<P>Before my going to Holland I was at the &s;hop of a barber in this city &s;everal times to be &s;haved; the &s;econd time I was there, I had to wait a while for my turn, he having no a&s;&s;i&s;tant; and when others were gone out he told me, he was &s;orry I had to wait and hoped he &s;hould have my cu&s;tom, and that if I would come on Saturdays and Wedne&s;days in the forenoon I need not wait; but in the afternoon others came; I a&s;ked him what days of the week tho&s;e were which he called Saturday, and Wedne&s;|day? he &s;eemed to wonder at my ignorance, but knew not how to tell me otherwi&s;e; I &s;aid, I do not read in the Scripures of any days &s;o named; he replied, that is true; for what rea&s;on then, &s;aid I, do&s;t thou call them &s;o; becau&s;e it is a common cu&s;|tom, &s;aid he; &s;uppo&s;e then, &s;aid I, that we lived in a heathen country among infidels who wor&s;hip|ped Idols, &s;hould we follow their cu&s;toms becau&s;e common? he replied, by no means; I then &s;aid, If I have under&s;tood rightly, the Heathens gave the days of the week tho&s;e names: I never heard that before, &s;aid he, pray for what rea&s;on? I an&s;wered they wor&s;hipped the Sun on the fir&s;t day of the week and named it after their idol, Sunday; the Moon on the &s;econd day of the week, &s;o came
<PB N="147" REF="016223_0153_0F9BD2CFF0CDCE10">
monday, and the other days after other idols, for they had many gods; third day they called tue&s;day after their idol Tui&s;co; and after the idol Woden, fourth day they called wedne&s;day, and fifth day after their Idol Thor they called thur&s;day; from Friga, friday; and after Saturn they called the &s;eventh day, &s;aturday; and as I believe in the only true God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent, and expect Eternal Life by no other name or power, I dare not for con&s;cience &s;ake own the gods of the Heathen, or name a day after them; but choo&s;e the names which the days were called by, when the mo&s;t high performed his &s;everal works of crea|tion, <HI>viz.</HI> fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, and &s;o on, which is &s;criptural, mo&s;t plain and ea&s;ily under&s;tood.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed &s;ome what affected with the informa|tion, and I de&s;ired him to inquire into the matter for him&s;elf, and not to think that I de&s;igned to im|po&s;e upon him; the next time of my going to his &s;hop, he &s;hewed me &s;ome papers whereon he had began to learn Algebra, and a&s;ked me how I liked it; I &s;aid it might be u&s;eful to &s;ome, but that I could take up grubbing or follow the plough with|out &s;tudying Algebra, as he might al&s;o &s;have a man, &amp;c. without it; be&s;ides I found it a more profita|ble and delightful &s;tudy to be quietly employed in learning the law of the Lord written in mine own heart, &s;o that I might walk before him acceptably.</P>
<P>On my return from Holland to Norwich, a man ran to me in the &s;treet putting a paper into my hand, and immediately left me, whom I &s;oon found to be this barber; the letter contained an innocent child like acknowledgment to me for my freedom with him, as is before mentioned in language rather too much &s;hewing his value for me as an in&s;tru|ment; and believing him to be reached by the love of Truth, and in mea&s;ure convinced of the princi|ple
<PB N="148" REF="016223_0154_0F9BD2D234A635E0">
thereof, I thought it be&s;t to leave him in the Lord's hand for further in&s;truction, to learn by the immediate teachings of the Holy Spirit, that his love might be centred on the true beloved of Souls; for want whereof many are hurt, looking outward and growing in head knowledge, &s;eeking the e&s;teem and friend&s;hip of men, from whom we are to cea&s;e, his breath and life being &s;topped at the Lord's command.</P>
<P>I mention this pa&s;&s;age with a view to &s;tir up my friends of the &s;ame holy profe&s;&s;ion, to let their language in words be the real language of Truth to all men, in purity of Spirit, and not to name the days of the week or months after the heathen|i&s;h idolatrous cu&s;toms, &s;aying for excu&s;e, that they to whom they &s;peak do be&s;t under&s;tand them, and it &s;aves them any further explanation, which ex|cu&s;e is far from proceeding from a di&s;po&s;ition apt to teach, and letting the Light of Truth &s;hine as they ought. <HI>Neither do men,</HI> &s;aid our ble&s;&s;ed in&s;tructor, <HI>light a candle and put it under a bu&s;hel; but on a candle&s;tick, and it giveth light to all that are in the hou&s;e,</HI> Mat. v. 21. Nor doth the Lord enlighten his candle, that is the &s;pirit of man, with the pure knowledge of Truth, that we &s;hould cover it, either with an ea&s;eful di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ave our&s;elves trouble, or hide the work thereof under the covering bu&s;hel of worldly &s;aving care, after the gain and trea&s;ure of this world; but that it may &s;tand on the candle|&s;tick, and thereby crown tho&s;e who are thus fa|voured with the holy Light, that as a city &s;et on an hill they cannot be hid.</P>
<P>The corrupt language of you to a &s;ingle per&s;on, and calling the months and days by heathen names, are e&s;teemed by &s;ome to be little things; but if a faithful te&s;timony in the&s;e little things, was ble&s;&s;ed in the in&s;tance before mentioned, even to the rai&s;|ing an earne&s;t inquiry after the &s;aving knowledge
<PB N="149" REF="016223_0155_0F9BD2D2C0ACC290">
of God and his ble&s;&s;ed Son, whom to know is Eter|nal Life; perhaps &s;uch who baulk their te&s;timony to the pure Talent of Truth given them to profit withal, may one day have their portion appointed with the wicked and &s;lothful &s;ervant, &s;ee <HI>Mat.</HI> xxv. 24-25. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>After the la&s;t mentioned meeting I found my mind ea&s;y to leave Norwich, and went with Richard Brew&s;ter and wife to Wymondam that evening, and next day to Edmond&s;bury, where feeling an en|gagement of mind we &s;taid eight days, attending their &s;everal meetings, and monthly-meeting, which is compo&s;ed of five particular meetings, where, un|der a &s;en&s;e of a forward formal mini&s;try, my &s;oul mourned and was cloathed with &s;orrow; the next day we had a precious meeting, and the &s;ame even|ing another with the mini&s;ters and &s;olid friends, in which it became my concern to &s;et forth the care they ought to exerci&s;e over each other, and how nece&s;&s;ary it was to deal plainly with tho&s;e that did not keep their places: Truth owned us together and I believe the opportunity will be remembered.</P>
<P>My mind being drawn to towards Wales, my companion John Pemberton who had been with me three years, having travelled together in much love and unity, inclining to go towards London, we parted in the &s;ame love, and I, accompanied by my kind friend Richard Brew&s;ter, went to Henry Gray's at Godmanche&s;ter in Huntingdon&s;hire, and the next day to Wellingborough in Northampton&s;hire, and were at their two meetings on fir&s;t day the twenty|third of the ninth month, which were heavy for want of more faithful inward labourers; that even|ing I had al&s;o a &s;itting with a &s;ick friend.</P>
<P>Next morning my friend R. Brew&s;ter returned homewards, and &s;everal friends coming to take leave of me, I had an opportunity to remark to them the rea&s;on that their meetings were &s;o dull
<PB N="150" REF="016223_0156_0F9BD2D787BCBE50">
and cloudy; for I thought I clearly &s;aw there was a neglect among them of putting the di&s;cipline in practice, where di&s;orders were evident; and that this neglect had cau&s;ed them to &s;uffer, which would &s;till continue and increa&s;e, until they &s;et the te&s;ti|mony of Truth over the heads of &s;uch who by di&s;|orderly walking had brought a reproach thereon: The friends were affected, and acknowledged they believed it to be the ca&s;e among&s;t them. We part|ed in tenderne&s;s and I proceeded on my journey with an income of &s;olid peace, and after riding thirty &s;even miles reached Banbury in Oxford&s;hire, and the next day Eatington in Warwick&s;hire, where I met with my friends Richard Partridge and Mary We&s;ton of London, and we were truly glad to &s;ee each other, &s;pending the day together and had a meeting with friends in the evening to our mutual comfort; we went in company to Warwick and Coventry, and at the meeting at the la&s;t place, which was comfortable, I thought I &s;en&s;ibly felt the benefit of the painful labour I had been exerci&s;ed in when there before; R. Partridge returning to London, Mary We&s;ton went with me to the quar|terly-meeting at Leice&s;ter, which began with a meet|ing of mini&s;ters and elders, and one for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline was held the &s;ame day; the &s;ervice in which lay heavy upon me, and Truth favoured, the power thereof being felt to the comfort of many; and I wi&s;h that &s;ea&s;on may not be forgotten by the members of that meeting; on the fir&s;t day follow|ing I went to a general meeting at Badgeley, and had an evening meeting at Daniel Lythal's at Pole&s;|worth, who hath a large family of hopeful tender children. I next went to Allen England's at Tam|worth, and had a &s;atisfactory opportunity in his fa|mily, to which I had felt a drawing in my mind for &s;ome time; but did not know that it would fall &s;o in the way to the quarterly-meeting at Stafford;
<PB N="151" REF="016223_0157_0F9BD2D9EAB79BA0">
which I attended and there met my friend Jo&s;hua Tofft, in company with whom I returned to Ridge|ley, and next day had a meeting at the widow Mor|ris's, and another that evening at Uttuxiter, from thence to Leek, and after a favoured meeting went home with Jo&s;hua to Hargate, where after re&s;ting one day, had another meeting at Leek, and an op|portunity with &s;ome friends at Jo&s;hua Strangman's, wherewith I had a degree of peace.</P>
<P>Accompanied by J. Tofft I went to a general meeting at Eaton in Che&s;hire, then to Macclesfield, Stockport, Morley, and Farnly, the la&s;t of which was a good meeting; there my friend Samuel Fo|thergill met me, and we went to a meeting at Sut|ton; the next day Su&s;anna Fothergill and her bro|ther Alexander came to &s;ee me, and we had a com|fortable time together at Thomas Hough's, being owned by Truth; I was next at a labourious meet|ing at Newton, tho' it ended well, and after it I met again with Jo&s;hua Tofft at Edgebury, and had a meeting the next day at Middlewich, then at Nantwich, and Che&s;ter, from whence rode to John Bellows at Stretton; my travelling and labours through Che&s;hire was in a particular clo&s;e manner, tho' there are &s;ome &s;olid friends in that county.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing to Shrew&s;bury in Shrop&s;hire, I was at a meeting on fir&s;t day at Colebrookdale and had &s;ome clo&s;e work; but Truth &s;eemed to give victory, and in the evening at Abraham Darby's hou&s;e had an opportunity, in which the te&s;timony of Truth pre|vailed to the tendering &s;ome high and lofty young people; who&s;e faults were told them in the power of the &s;earcher of hearts, for which the &s;incere were truly thankful.</P>
<P>Next day returning to Shrew&s;bury, I went to vi&s;it Benjamin Thomas and Richard Bellows, who had been confined in pri&s;on about four years and a half for their con&s;cientious refu&s;al to pay tithes, and
<PB N="152" REF="016223_0158_0F9BD2DB087BE3E8">
we had a comfortable &s;ea&s;on together in the jail, feeling the living pre&s;ence of the Lord, which makes his people free, even in pri&s;ons.</P>
<P>The day following had a meeting in this town, and one in the evening at the hou&s;e of John Young, both which afforded &s;ome peace; but the life of Truth is at a low &s;tate in Shrop&s;hire, and the pro|fe&s;&s;ors with us few in number.</P>
<P>I then pa&s;&s;ed into North-Wales, to Charles Lloyd's at Dolobran in Montgomery&s;hire, John Young be|ing with me, and had a meeting there, at this place there was formerly a large meeting; but it is now much declined; from thence we went to Tydeni|garrig in Merrioneth&s;hire, and had a meeting with a few &s;incere friends at the hou&s;e of Lewis Owen; after which I proceeded on my vi&s;it to the other meetings in this county; fir&s;t at Llwindu in the family of Humphrey Owen, which was a comforta|ble time, tho' no other friends live in this place; then at the hou&s;e of John Goodwin in E&s;gingoch in Montgomery&s;hire, where were &s;everal tender friends; but the living are &s;carcely able to bear the weight of tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ors, who altho' they know the truth, do not abide therein, and &s;o are as withered branches ca&s;t forth. Next was a pretty large and &s;atisfactory meeting at Talcoyd in Radnor&s;hire, then at Cwm, and Gluerindrew, and on a fir&s;t day at Penbank, where are many profe&s;&s;ors, tho' but few &s;olid friends; after which at Penplace and Caermar|then, which la&s;t meeting was much to my &s;atisfacti|on, the few friends here being of the better &s;ort; from hence to Haverfordwe&s;t with friends by them|&s;elves mo&s;tly, and &s;taying their meetings on fir&s;t day, that in the afternoon was open and &s;atisfactory as to other profe&s;&s;ors who came in; but pride and worldly mindedne&s;s hath much hurt the members of our &s;ociety, tho' there are a few tender friends. In the evening I had another opportunity with
<PB N="153" REF="016223_0159_0F9BD2DBC8EF0878">
friends, and was enabled to relieve my mind among them with a degree of thankfulne&s;s; next meeting was at Jame&s;town, and in the evening of the day following at Larn with the people of the town, who behaved civilly, but &s;eemed barren as to religion in a right &s;en&s;e; there is but one in this town in unity with friends, and he &s;eemed near his end, whom I vi&s;ited. After cro&s;&s;ing a ferry near a mile broad, not without great danger, being driven on &s;hore and the wind very high, the boat was likely to fill with water, that I was obliged to go over a mar&s;h to Caermarthen, being thankful for the de|liverance, where I had a public meeting with the town's people, to a good degree of &s;atisfaction, and next morning met with my brother W^m^. Brown at Swanzey, and we were made joyful in the company of each other; here we had two meetings, and ano|ther with friends &s;elected, in which he got &s;ome relief; after his leaving me here having a concern on my mind I vi&s;ited the families of friends, tho' not with|out fear; but felt the help and &s;trength of my great and good ma&s;ter, who furni&s;hed me with power and &s;kill to di&s;charge my duty, both to the luke|warm and the corrupt di&s;orderly profe&s;&s;ors, without wounding his own children, &s;ome of whom there are in this town; I &s;tay'd their meeting on fourth day, which &s;ea&s;on being divinely favoured, I pray may not be forgotten, the power which alone can enable to tread on &s;corpions or &s;erpents, and pre|&s;erve from the force of deadly poi&s;on being over all: The honour, prai&s;e, and glory, be a&s;cribed to the Lord who is worthy for ever!</P>
<P>Next day I re&s;ted, and in a degree of humble thankfulne&s;s made the&s;e remarks.</P>
<P>I continued many days longer in this town, in which time had divers meetings, &s;ome whereof were very &s;atisfactory, many of the town's people attending, and the good hand of the Lord was
<PB N="154" REF="016223_0160_0F9BD2DD5E949148">
&s;tretched forth towards them; for which I was truly thankful; after &s;pending &s;ixteen days among them I went to Llantri&s;hon, and the next day had a meet|ing at Trewaruge; then one at Hillary with a ten|der enquiring people, al&s;o at Cardiff with a &s;eeking people, who had &s;eparated them&s;elves from the public wor&s;hip and met together in &s;ilence; this opportunity was an in&s;tructive &s;ea&s;on to them. On the fir&s;t day following I was at Pontipool, where at two meetings I had many clo&s;e things to deliver, ob&s;erving want of order among them; in the evening had an opportunity with &s;ome of the friends mo&s;t active in the di&s;cipline, and endea|voured to di&s;charge my&s;elf; and on third day a large and pretty open meeting; being detained by a great &s;now, I had another meeting with friends of the foremo&s;t rank on &s;ixth day, in which I cleared my mind of a great burden, which I had borne on ac|count of a formal mini&s;try among them; my next meeting was at Shere-Newton, which was pretty large tho' dull, the favour of Truth being much lo&s;t among friends here; yet I was favoured with &s;trength to di&s;charge my&s;elf, and in the feeling &s;en&s;e of peace went that night to the pa&s;&s;age over the Severn, and next day to Bri&s;tol, my friend and kind landlord James Griffiths bearing me company from his own hou&s;e at Swanzey.</P>
<P>On third day I attended their meeting in Bri&s;tol, but fat in &s;ilence, and was very heavy hearted un|der a &s;en&s;e of a forward &s;pirit, which would prompt to an&s;wer the expectations of the people, and is apt to prevail on &s;ome who &s;eem to be called to the work of the mini&s;try; but Truth only ble&s;&s;eth its own motion.</P>
<P>I continued in and near this city about four weeks, attending their &s;everal meetings, but did not feel relief from the burden I was under, and on the fifteenth of the fir&s;t month (1754,) hearing that
<PB N="155" REF="016223_0161_0F9BD2DDFAD0DAB0">
my brother W^m^. Brown was at Ann Young's at Erthcot, I went there to &s;ee him, and we were comforted in each others company, and next being their meeting day, we attended it to our refre&s;h|ment; from whence we returned together to Bri|&s;tol, where we tarried until the twenty-&s;ixth, in which time I had &s;everal open meetings, which &s;et me at liberty to leave that city, when we again parted, and I took meetings at Ulver&s;tone, Thorn|bury, Sad&s;bury, Dedmartin, Tedbury, and two at Nail&s;worth, and another there in the evening, when I had an opportunity to the ea&s;e of my mind, heavily oppre&s;&s;ed on account of the formal profe&s;|&s;ors of truth, to the comfort of the faithful, and cau&s;ed thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>From thence calling to vi&s;it the widow Fowler who was in affliction, I went to meetings at Pain&s;|wick, Glouce&s;ter, Ro&s;s in Hereford&s;hire, Almerly, Leomin&s;ter, and Uphan, where I vi&s;ited the wives of the two friends before mentioned, who are impri&s;oned at Shrew&s;bury for their te&s;timony again&s;t Tithes; then returning to Leomin&s;ter attended the monthly-meeting there, in which truth owned us, and taking a meeting at Broom&s;grove went to Wor|ce&s;ter, and on fir&s;t day was at two comfortable meetings, and another on third day, and the next day attended the quarterly-meeting, which was a precious time, wherein friends were comforted; and finding a concern on my mind I went into the women's meeting, wherein the power of Truth ac|companied, which is the crown of our religious meetings, here is a tender feed e&s;pecially among&s;t the female &s;ex, which will thrive if this Divine power is kept unto.</P>
<P>Being now clear of this city, I departed with peace to meetings at Tew&s;kbury, Cheltenham, and again to Nail&s;worth, where I was at two meetings, which tho' hard, I had an evidence that the Lord
<PB N="156" REF="016223_0162_0F9BD2E33191B668">
had not for&s;aken his &s;eeking people. After attend|ing a conference with &s;everal friends endeavouring to compo&s;e a difference, which ended to &s;atisfacti|on, I proceeded to the quarterly meeting for Glou|ce&s;ter&s;hire held at Tedbury, where I again met with my brother W.

<P>Next day my brother went to Bath and I to Ci|rence&s;ter, where I had a hard and dull meeting, the profe&s;&s;ors of truth having too much departed from the favour thereof; at another in the evening I had an evidence of having di&s;charged my duty; then proceeded to meetings at Farringdon in Berk|&s;hire, Litchfield, Burford in Oxford&s;hire, Milton, Stow in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, Chipping-Norton, Charlbu|ry, Witney, Abingdon, Warbury, North End, and from thence to High Wiccomb, where the weather being very cold I tarried &s;ix days, vi&s;iting &s;everal families of &s;ick friends, and the la&s;t public meeting being in the evening, many of the town's people attended, and it was a &s;olid opportunity. From thence I went to Amer&s;ham tho' with difficulty on account of the &s;now, and on fir&s;t day had a meeting at Che&s;ham; then to Hamp&s;tead, and had there a meeting, which was much enlarged by the &s;cholars of W^m^. Squire's &s;chool, &s;everal of whom were affec|ted; then having a good opportunity with friends at Albans, I went to London, where I remained &s;even weeks and three days, vi&s;iting the meetings and felt much of the weight and burden of the &s;ervice be|fore me there, and in the opening and authority of Truth, I had to &s;peak to the pre&s;ent date of our &s;ociety, not only to the in&s;truction of the &s;eek|ing children and comforting of the mourners; but al&s;o by way of rebuke to the di&s;orderly, and clo&s;e warning to the rebellious.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Friends in Wilt&s;hire.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING had &s;trong de&s;ires in my mind for your welfare in the truth, I purpo&s;ed to have attended your quarterly-meeting, but being lett at this time, and not knowing that I &s;hall ever have an opportunity to &s;ee you, I feel a freedom to vi&s;it you with a few lines in the opening and love of truth, which flows to you-ward.</P>
<P>Dear Friends, male and female, old and young, as many of you as are de&s;irous to be called the Children of God, and followers of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, be humble, that you may be taught of him; for it is the humble that he teaches of his ways; and be ye meek and low in heart, that you may &s;erve him in your generation, and one another in his pure fear, &s;o you will know him for your re&s;t, and his peace your quiet habitation.</P>
<P>My &s;oul hath mourned, and is in &s;ome degree covered therewith at this time, under a &s;en&s;e that the love of the world, and its plea&s;ures and earthly
<PB N="158" REF="016223_0164_0F9BD2E59BF35D70">
delights, abound in too many, (which is iniquity) and becau&s;e thereof the love of many towards God waxeth cold; and for want of witne&s;&s;ing the love of God in a pure heart, the mind becomes at ea&s;e, lukewarm, and indifferent about the things which belong to our peace and future happine&s;s, and &s;o fathers and mothers, ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, become dull, if not dead to that holy concern, which &s;hould ever excite them, both by example and precept, to in&s;truct and train up their children and &s;ervants in all Godline&s;s of life and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Oh dear Friends! &s;earch your hearts, and diligently enquire whether &s;omething hath not &s;ub|tilly crept in, and &s;tolen away your affections from God; and the deep attention of your minds from the in&s;tructions of his Holy Spirit of Truth; and if this becomes your concern, I fully believe that the Lord will ble&s;s you with enlightened minds to &s;ee, and willing hearts to give up all to the fire and &s;word of his Word and Spirit, that your hearts may be purged, and made tabernacles and temples in which he would take delight to dwell: For if the &s;oul is cha&s;te in Love to God, and the eye of the mind &s;ingle to the in&s;truction of the &s;pirit of truth, the whole body will be full of Light: It is herein that the children of God are pre&s;erved &s;afe in their own &s;ecret &s;teps before the Lord, and free from giving occa&s;ion of &s;tumbling to others.</P>
<P>I am fully per&s;uaded there is a remnant among&s;t you, who feelingly know, that the living &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ence and power of God, in your meetings both for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, is not plentifully enjoyed, but is at a low ebb: And it is in my mind to let you know what has appeared to me to be as one great rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> There are many profe&s;|&s;ors of the truth among&s;t you, who delight to be accounted of as friends in e&s;teem in the &s;ociety; who have a &s;mooth and fawning behaviour, and
<PB N="159" REF="016223_0165_0F9BD2E6E84324E8">
flattering tongues, and do &s;eek the love and friend|&s;hip of &s;uch who are friends of truth, for their own honour and credit, and the reputation of &s;elf. Dear Friends, of &s;uch beware, for their friend&s;hip is poi&s;on, and their intimate fellow&s;hip, if cleaved unto, is benumbing, even to in&s;en&s;ibility: And for want of a clear di&s;covery of that &s;pirit, &s;ome of the tender and &s;incere hearted among&s;t you have &s;uffered.</P>
<P>In whom&s;oever earthly mindedne&s;s prevails, or the love of the world and its friend&s;hip; there is a &s;ecret giving way to, and a gradual reconcilia|tion with its &s;ordid practices; and the eye that once &s;aw in the true Light, becomes clo&s;ed or dimmed, if not wholly blinded by the God of this world.</P>
<P>Liberty is then taken by parents, and indul|gence is given to their children; which occa&s;ions pain and di&s;tre&s;s of heart to tho&s;e who have not lo&s;t their &s;ight and feeling: But &s;ome, for fear of being rebuked and di&s;e&s;teemed by &s;uch who have a &s;en&s;e of them, will court their affections; with which bait they have been taken, and &s;o have been afraid to &s;peak their minds plainly le&s;t they &s;hould offend, or drive them further from the &s;ociety; concluding there is a tender thing in them, becau&s;e they &s;eem to love friends: And &s;o many who might have made great progre&s;s have lo&s;t ground, for want of &s;peaking truth to their neighbours; and thus the infection of pride, libertini&s;m, and earthly mindedne&s;s has &s;pread and prevailed, even to the hurt of &s;ome families, that were once exceedingly grieved therewith.</P>
<P>Wherefore, my dear Friends, fear God with a perfect heart, and in his Light watch over your own &s;elves and your families: So &s;hall your hearts be warmly influenced, and filled with holy zeal, and love to God and his Truth; in which you will be bold to act in your meetings for di&s;cipline, and
<PB N="160" REF="016223_0166_0F9BD2E70E89D8F8">
in the power of God, which is the authority of the church, you will be able to judge tho&s;e who walk di&s;orderly; and being faithful therein, you will re|move the &s;tumbling blocks, and roll away the re|proach which is imputed to the church.</P>
<P>Then would the Lord feed &s;uch his faithful labourers with his Heavenly Bread, and honour them with his Life giving, pre&s;ence and whether the di&s;orderly would hear or forbear, the Lord would be the &s;hield and exceeding great reward of his people, and fill their hearts with prai&s;e to his name, who is worthy forever and ever.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I have before hinted, that in my travelling to the meetings in Wilt&s;hire, and attending the quarterly-meeting in the &s;eventh month, Old Stile, 1750, I was &s;traitened to clear my&s;elf towards them, which occa&s;ioned me to leave them in pain of mind, but now having &s;ent them this epi&s;tle I was made ea&s;y, believing they would read it, and &s;end copies there|of to their &s;everal monthly-meetings, which would be likely to be heard by more friends than if my concern had been delivered in the quarterly-meet|ing only; inclo&s;ing it to an innocent friend at Chip|penham, I de&s;ired him to deliver it to the &s;aid meet|ing, which I afterwards understood he did, and that friends had an&s;wered my reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Now feeling my mind ea&s;y to leave London for a while, I went to E&s;her in Surry, was the next day at a large meeting at King&s;ton on Thames, which was pretty open as to doctrine, the people &s;eemed attentive and &s;everal much tendered; there are but few friends here.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="016223_0167_0F9BD2E7C87373C0">I then vi&s;ited divers other meetings in Hamp&s;hire and Berk&s;hire, being made thankful to the great author of all good, who had been with me in the journey under my indi&s;po&s;ition of body; coming to London I met with many friends from different parts of the nation in order to attend the yearly-meeting, which began on the &s;econd day of the &s;ixth month, and continued ten days, being a very large and in the main a &s;olid meeting; many weighty affairs relating to our religious &s;ociety were therein con&s;idered, it was then al&s;o agreed, that in future this meeting &s;hould begin with a meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, on the &s;eventh day of the week at the third hour in the afternoon, that en|quiry might be made into the &s;tate of the mini&s;try in general, which I hope may be attended with good &s;ervice hereafter.</P>
<P>On the eleventh of the &s;ixth month and third day of the week, after the parting meeting I went from London to Margarets in Hertford&s;hire, next day attended a yearly-meeting in Hertford which was very large.</P>
<P>The next day I accompanied &s;everal friends who were appointed to vi&s;it a monthly-meeting, the members of which paid tithes, and contended for liberty &s;o to do without cen&s;ure; we had a confer|ence with them, in which the te&s;timony of Truth being &s;et over them for that time, they were taken and confounded in their own arguments.</P>
<P>After this I attended a general or yearly-meeting at Baldock, which was very large and &s;atisfactory, returning next morning to London, I was truly thankful that I had been enabled to attend the&s;e three meetings, enjoying great peace in my labours there, which lay heavy upon me; my gracious and good Ma&s;ter gave me wi&s;dom, boldne&s;s, and &s;trength to clear my&s;elf in the love and power of Truth, to the tendering of many hearts; may I

ever remember his mercies to me, and be enabled to ble&s;s and prai&s;e his holy name, who is worthy for ever!</P>
<P>Continuing in and near London about ten days, I then went to a large &s;atisfactory meeting at Roche&s;ter in Kent, where were &s;everal clergymen, who behaved well; next day had a meeting at Loos in the hou&s;e of Thomas Cri&s;p with a few friends and divers others; then going to my friend William Patter&s;ons, at Canterbury, I was at their meeting in that town, and the day following had one on the I&s;le of Thanet, where there are a few friendly peo|ple; the meeting next day at Dover was pretty open; on fir&s;t day I was at two meetings at Folk|&s;tone, which were dull and heavy, tho' there are many friends in that place, among&s;t whom I was favoured with &s;trength to ea&s;e my mind.</P>
<P>I then vi&s;ited the Meetings at mar&s;ham, A&s;hford, Tenterden, (to which friends of Colebrook came,) Gardner&s;treet, Lewis, Brightelm&s;tone, Ifield, Hor&s;|ham, Shipley, Arundle, and Chiche&s;ter, when find|ing a concern to vi&s;it the families of friends in this city, I &s;pent two days in the &s;ervice and had &s;ame clo&s;e exerci&s;e, tho' a good degree of peace; I al&s;o attended their two meetings on fir&s;t day, which were heavy and laborious; for tho' here are &s;ome tender people, yet the &s;pirit of the world has brought a bla&s;t on &s;everal profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>From hence I went to Go&s;port in Hamp&s;hire where we had a meeting, al&s;o one in the evening at Port&s;mouth, Jn^o^. Griffith and Jerem. Waring being with me; then going to Southampton, went in a boat to Cowes on the I&s;le of Wight, and the day after had a good meeting at Newport, likewi&s;e one in the evening with the town's people, after another opportunity with friends, returned to Cowes where I had another with a few of our brethren, &s;o went back to Southampton, and on fir&s;t day the

twenty-fir&s;t of the &s;eventh month attended two meetings at Pool in Dor&s;et&s;hire, which were dull and laborious; a worldly libertine &s;pirit has brought a bla&s;t on many: Next day we had a meeting with a few friends at Weymouth, then at Bridport, truth &s;eems at a low ebb in Dor&s;et&s;hire: The next meet|ing was at Ringwood in Hamp&s;hire, which was dull; where the life of Truth is not abode in, peo|ple will wither. The &s;ame evening we had a meet|ing to pretty good &s;atisfaction at Fordingbridge; then one at Alton, at which place we had another very &s;atisfactory meeting, on fir&s;t day, and that evening at Godalmen; the next day had a meeting at Capel in Surry and in the evening at Darking; on the day following at Ryegate and in the evening at Croydon; from whence on fourth day morning the thirty-fir&s;t of the &s;eventh month coming again to London for the la&s;t time, I &s;pent eight days more with friends in that city.</P>
<P>On my coming here from Albans, on the nine|teenth of the third month before mentioned, I felt great fear to po&s;&s;e&s;s my mind, having at &s;undry times before &s;pent about thirteen weeks in that city, mo&s;tly under a clo&s;e exerci&s;e of &s;pirit, without an openne&s;s to &s;ay much in public or private to obtain relief; &s;o that to go thither again appeared to me like entering into a cloud, altho' I was &s;ecretly bound in &s;pirit to proceed; but attending all the meetings as they came in cour&s;e, I felt a gradual openne&s;s and &s;trength to decare tho&s;e things, which before had been &s;ealed up, being now made &s;en&s;ible that every opening or vi&s;ion, which the Lord is plea&s;ed to manife&s;t to his &s;ervants, are not for im|mediate utterance; but the Lord who gives judg|ment &s;hould be carefully waited' upon, who only can &s;hew, by the manife&s;tation of his heavenly light, the time when, and by the gentle putting forth of his arm of power, abilitates in the opening of his
<PB N="164" REF="016223_0170_0F9BD2EC82BB0920">
&s;pirit, which giveth tongue and utterance to &s;peak the word of Truth, in the demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit and power, that openeth a door of entrance in the hearts of them who hear. Our dear Lord &s;aid, <HI>For it is not ye that &s;peak; but the Spirit of your Father, which &s;peaketh in you,</HI> Mat. x. 20.</P>
<P>Now as my &s;ervice opened and &s;trength increa&s;ed, I was invited by &s;ome to their hou&s;es to dine, who before looked on me with indifference; but now &s;aid they &s;hould be glad to &s;ee me there to be more acquainted; but as I felt on my fir&s;t arrival in this city, a &s;ecret prohibition from going much from hou&s;e to hou&s;e without inward leave, &s;o now the &s;ame re&s;traint continued with me, left by going to &s;uch places 1 might &s;omewhat contradict by ex|ample, the precepts which Truth had directed me to diliver in public, to wit, a life of &s;elf-denial and temperance in eating and drinking, with a &s;teady inward attention to the teachings of the Spirit of Grace, in order to know an e&s;tabli&s;hment of heart thereby, as being the certain duty of every follower of Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord.</P>
<P>Thus I think I have &s;een that there is great need to be exceedingly careful, when the Lord is plea&s;ed to reach unto and convict di&s;orderly walkers by in|&s;trumental means, that we do not le&s;&s;en the weight of Divine reproof, by being familiar with &s;uch as if all was well; for they are apt to be fond of the in|&s;trument through whom they have been reached, and if by their fondling, they gain the e&s;teem of &s;uch a friend, it &s;eems to heal them before their wounds are &s;earched to the bottom; &s;o that I rather cho&s;e retirement, and to live as private as I well could; now I al&s;o &s;aw, that if I had fought many acquaintance, and thereby beheld the conduct and behaviour of &s;ome in their families, my way would not have been &s;o open as it now was.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="016223_0171_0F9BD2ED0973B938">In many meetings the Love and Power of Truth was felt by the humble dependant children, who&s;e eyes were fixed on their Heavenly Helper, and at &s;ome of the la&s;t in London, I had with an innocent boldne&s;s to appeal to friends to bear witne&s;s of the manner in which I had &s;pent my time in that city; that I had not fought to be popular, nor endeavour|ed to gain the prai&s;e of any, or the friend&s;hip of tho&s;e who were not the real friends of truth, keep|ing in a good degree under the innocency and &s;im|plicity thereof; yet with a near affection I felt my &s;pirit united to the children of the heavenly family among&s;t them; but had never fought to &s;teal their love from the great parent to whom they did be|long; my prayer and heart's de&s;ire having been, that there abode might be in the truth, and their affections placed on God, and the whole delight of their hearts to meditate in his holy law; that if through me as an in&s;trument they had received any benefit, the prai&s;e belonged to the Lord the only &s;upreme good; and if in future they did but love, fear and &s;erve him, it was little to me whether they ever remembered that I had been among&s;t them. Neverthele&s;s a participation of the love of God by the members of the true church, has taught them to know the communion of &s;aints, and the deeply engraven unity of the one &s;pirit, which makes them as Epi&s;tles written in one another's hearts, which time or di&s;tance can never era&s;e.</P>
<P>Having &s;pent fir&s;t and la&s;t in London about twen|ty three weeks, on the ninth day of the eighth month and &s;ixth of the week, after a &s;olid meeting at Grace Church-&s;treet, I felt my&s;elf at liberty to &s;et my face homewards; the &s;ame &s;hip in which I came over, and the &s;ame captain Setphen Me&s;nard, being now ready to go for Philadelphia, I went that night to Grave&s;end accompanied by about twelve friends, the next morning we went on board

</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR Yearly-meeting for wor&s;hip at Notting|ham was held in the week after I landed, and I was greatly rejoiced to &s;ee many of my friends and acquaintance there.</P>
<P>In the eleventh month following I went up to the quarterly-meeting in Philadelphia, and returned to ours at Concord, where al&s;o was Samuel Fothergill; it was a very large meeting, in which he was di|vinely opened in &s;peaking to the &s;tate of friends in his public mini&s;try, and &s;erviceable in the di&s;cipline; he al&s;o attended our general-meeting in the &s;ame month at London-Grove, which was al&s;o large and profitable, then went towards Lanca&s;ter on his way to the Southern Provinces.</P>
<P>I &s;pent this winter mo&s;tly at and near home, at times attending &s;ome neighbouring meetings, until towards the &s;pring I took a &s;mall journey to &s;even or eight others.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="016223_0174_0F9BD2F2412F5458">During my late travels in Europe, beholding the declen&s;ion of many of the profe&s;&s;ors of truth from the ancient &s;implicity in habit and deportment, I &s;ometimes was ready to cry out and &s;ay, O Penn|&s;ylvania! may thine inhabitants be for ever &s;trangers to the vanities of the world, and the profe&s;&s;ors of truth keep their garments clean from the &s;pots thereof, pride and &s;uperfluity of every kind; but now with &s;orrow of heart, I thought I beheld ma|ny of the youth in our &s;ociety taking their flight as into the air, where the &s;nares of the prince of the power thereof are laid to catch them, &s;ome of whom being already &s;o much en&s;nared to their un&s;peaka|ble hurt, I knew them not otherwi&s;e than by their natural features and a family re&s;emblance, their demeanour and habit being &s;o exceedingly altered in a little more than four years; yet to my comfort I &s;aw a few, who by walking in the Light, had e&s;caped the wiles of &s;atan and were growing in the Truth.</P>
<P>In the fourth month (1755) I attended the gene|ral annual-meeting at Duck-Creek, al&s;o meetings at Little-Creek and George's-Creek, the la&s;t of which was more open than I expected, &s;everal of other &s;ocieties being there, who behaved orderly; after which I &s;pent mo&s;t of the &s;ummer at home, diligently attending our meetings for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, and had to ob&s;erve that the general part of the members of our meeting, were for &s;ome|time remarkable in their care to come together near the hour appointed, and we had &s;ome precious op|portunities, many of which were held in &s;ilence, wherein I often &s;aw it to be a time of renewed vi|&s;itation to many, which if not carefully improved, would not be continued very long; but that a more trying &s;ea&s;on would overtake us, (of which I was &s;ometimes led to &s;peak as truth opened) wherein the door of outward mini&s;try would be more clo&s;ed up,
<PB N="169" REF="016223_0175_0F9BD2F4D71C88D0">
which would prove the religion of the profe&s;&s;ors of truth, and manife&s;t what they attended meetings for, whether to wait upon God for the Spiritual Bread, or on man for outward mini&s;try.</P>
<P>In the ninth month I attended our yearly-meeting in Philadelphia, which was large and &s;olid, where|in many weighty matters coming under con&s;iderati|on were concluded to &s;atisfaction, that many friends parted in a feeling &s;en&s;e of the over&s;hadowing of the Heavenly wing, with reverent thankfulne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>In the tenth month I attended Shrew&s;bury quar|terly-meeting in Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey, at which al&s;o were our friends John Evans and Jo&s;eph White, it was large the &s;ittings thereof being favoured with a degree of the Divine pre&s;ence; we al&s;o attended the monthly-meeting there and had &s;ome &s;ervice; friends were encouraged to deal with &s;uch who were di&s;orderly in conduct, there having been &s;ome &s;lackne&s;s among them in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P>As the &s;ound of war and public commotions, had now entered the borders of the&s;e heretofore peaceful provinces, &s;ome &s;olid thoughts attended my mind at Shrew&s;bury, re&s;pecting the nature of giving money for the King's u&s;e, knowing the &s;ame to be intended for the carrying on of war. John Evans accompanying me homewards, we took three meetings in our way, the la&s;t being at Eve&s;ham, at which place I told him that I felt an engagement of mind to go to Philadelphia, and he con&s;ented to go with me; when we came to the city the A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania being &s;itting, we under&s;tood that a Committee of the Hou&s;e was appointed to prepare a bill, for granting a &s;um of money for the King's u&s;e to be i&s;&s;ued in paper bills of credit, to be called in and &s;unk at a &s;tated time by a tax on the inha|bitants, on which account &s;everal friends were un|der a clo&s;e exerci&s;e of mind, &s;ome of whom being

And that it is his detemination to exalt this ble&s;&s;ed day, in this our age, if in the depth of humility we receive his in&s;tructions, and obey his voice: And being painfully apprehen&s;ive, that the large &s;um granted by the late Act of A&s;&s;embly for the King's u&s;e, is principally intended for purpo&s;es incon&s;i&s;tent with our peaceable te&s;timony; we therefore think, that as we cannot be concerned in wars and fightings, &s;o neither ought we to contribute thereto, by pay|ing the tax directed by the &s;aid act, though &s;uffer|ing be the con&s;equence of our refu&s;al, which we hope to be enabled to bear with patience.

<P>The Indians having burnt &s;everal hou&s;es on the frontiers of this Province, al&s;o at Gnadenhutten in Northampton County, and murdered and &s;calped &s;ome of the inhabitants; at the time of this meet|ing two or three of the dead bodies were brought to Philadelphia in a waggon, with an intent as was &s;uppo&s;ed to animate the people to unite in prepara|tions of war to take vengeance on the Indians, and de&s;troy them: They were carried along &s;everal of the &s;treets, many people following, cur&s;ing the In|dians, al&s;o the Quakers becau&s;e they would not join in war for de&s;truction of the Indians. The &s;ight of the dead bodies and the outcry of the people, were very afflicting and &s;hocking to me: Standing at the door of a friend's hou&s;e as they pa&s;&s;ed along, my mind was humbled and turned much inward when I was made &s;ecretly to cry; <HI>What will become of Penn&s;ylvania?</HI> for it felt to me that many did not con&s;ider, that the &s;ins of the inhabitants, pride, profane &s;wearing, drunkenne&s;s with other wickedne&s;s were the cau&s;e, that the Lord had &s;uf|fered this calamity and &s;courge to come upon them; the weight of my exerci&s;e increa&s;ing as I walked along the &s;treet; at length it was &s;aid in my &s;oul, <HI>This Land is polluted with blood, and in the day of inqui&s;ition for blood, it will not only be required at the frontiers and borders, but even in this place where the&s;e bodies are now &s;een.</HI> I &s;aid within my&s;elf, "How can this be? &s;ince this has been a land of peace, and as yet not much concerned in war;" but as it were in a moment mine eyes turned to the ca&s;e of the poor en&s;laved Negroes: And however light

a matter they who have been concerned with them may look upon the purcha&s;ing, &s;elling, or keeping tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed people in &s;lavery, it then appeared plain to me, that &s;uch were partakers in iniquity, encouragers of war and the &s;hedding of innocent blood, which is often the ca&s;e, where tho&s;e unhap|py people are or have been captivated and brought away for &s;laves: The &s;ame day I went to Pine-&s;treet meeting under an exerci&s;ing mournful &s;tate of mind, and thought I could be willing to &s;it among the peo|ple undi&s;covered.</P>
<P>I attended our Quarterly-meeting at Concord in the fifth month, and in a few days after went to the yearlv-meeting at We&s;t-River in Maryland, which was large and in a good degree &s;atisfactory, then going to meetings at Herring-Creek, and the Clifts, returned the following fir&s;t day to We&s;t-River, where I had a good opportunity to clear my&s;elf towards friends of that place; being concerned on account of &s;everal of the elders, who did not con|duct &s;o examplary as they ought before the youth, and left them relieved in my mind; from thence I returned home, taking &s;everal meetings in my way.</P>
<P>In the ninth month I was at our yearly-meeting for Penn&s;ylvania and New-Jer&s;ey, held this year at Burlington, which was large and edifying; many weighty matters being in much brotherly love re|&s;ulted to &s;atisfaction, our friend Thomas Gawthrop from Great Britain was there, in the time there|of our worthy friend and brother John Evans of Gwynnedd departing this life, Thomas and I went to attend the burial, on which &s;olemn occa&s;ion, he had a &s;ea&s;onable opportunity to remind a large gathering of people of their latter end, and I thought it was a &s;olid time.</P>
<P>Being one of the committee appointed by the yearly-meeting to vi&s;it the quarterly and monthly-meetings, I was careful in attending on that &s;ervice,

<P>In the Spring of the year 1757, I al&s;o attended our general-meeting for mini&s;ters and elders held at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Having often remembered a remarkable account given me when in England by our ancient worthy friend John Richard&s;on, which as it made &s;ome im|pre&s;&s;ion on my mind I committed to writing, and now reviving think it is worthy to be pre&s;erved, being nearly as follows, tho' I was not particular in regard to the time of the occurrence, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>"Peter Gardner, a Friend who lived in E&s;&s;ex, had a concern to vi&s;it friends in Scotland; but being low in circum&s;tances, and having a wife and &s;everal children, was under di&s;couragement about it: The Lord in mercy conde&s;cended to remove his doubts, by letting him know he would be with him, and though he had no hor&s;e to ride, and was but a weakly man, yet he would give him &s;trength to perform the journey, and &s;u&s;tain him &s;o that he &s;hould not want for what was &s;ufficient. And having faith, he laid his concern before the monthly-meet|ing he belonged to, with innocent weight; and friends concurring with him therein, he took his journey along the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Nation, through Norfolk, Lincoln&s;hire, and York&s;hire, and coming to a week-day meeting at Bridlington where John Richard&s;on then dwelt, he lodged at his hou&s;e. In the evening the doors being &s;hut, Peter a&s;ked him if any friend lived that way, (pointing with his finger) John told him he pointed towards the &s;ea, which was not far from thence: he &s;aid he believed he mu&s;t go and &s;ee &s;omebody that way in the morn|ing,
<PB N="178" REF="016223_0184_0F9BD307BAB115E0">
John a&s;ked him if he &s;hould go with him? he &s;aid he believed it would not be be&s;t, and &s;o went to bed."</P>
<P>"In the morning when John's wife had prepared breakfa&s;t, he thought he would go and &s;ee if the friend was well, but found the bed empty, and that he was gone, at which John Richard&s;on wondred; but &s;oon after Peter came in, to whom John &s;aid, Thou ha&s;t taken a morning walk, come to break|fa&s;t: And before they had done eating, a friend from the Quay or harbour (the way that Peter Gardner pointed to over night) came in, and &s;aid, "I wonder at thee John, to &s;end this man with &s;uch a me&s;&s;age to my hou&s;e," and related as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> That he came to him as he was &s;tanding at the Fi&s;h-market-Place, looking on the &s;ea, to ob&s;erve the wind, That he a&s;ked him if he would walk into his hou&s;e? to which Peter an&s;wered that he came for that purpo&s;e; (this was in the twilight of the morning,) that when he went into the hou&s;e, he enquired whether his wife was well, to which the man an&s;wered, that &s;he was &s;ick in bed, and in|vited him to go in and &s;ee her; he &s;aid he came &s;o to do: Then being conducted into the chamber where the &s;ick woman was, he &s;at down by her; and after a &s;hort time told her, the will and re&s;ig|nation of her mind was accepted in&s;tead of the deed, and that &s;he was excu&s;ed from the journey which had been before her, and &s;hould die in peace with God and men: Then turning to the man (her hu&s;band) he &s;aid, Thy wife had a concern to vi&s;it the churches in another country beyond the &s;ea, but thou would&s;t not give her leave, &s;o &s;he &s;hall be taken from thee; and behold, the Lord's hand is again&s;t thee, and thou &s;halt be bla&s;ted in what&s;o|ever thou doe&s;t, and reduced to want thy bread. So the man &s;eemed angry with John Richard&s;on, who &s;aid to him, "be &s;till, and weigh the matter,
<PB N="179" REF="016223_0185_0F9BD309099FD630">
for I knew not of the friend's going to thy hou&s;e; but thought he was in bed, and did not inform him about thee nor thy wife," at which he went away. &s;o Peter pur&s;ued his journey towards Scotland, John Richard&s;on and another friend going with him to Scarborough on hor&s;e back, (for he would not let them go on foot with him,) he kept before them full as fa&s;t as they cho&s;e to ride; and when they had gone about half way, he gained ground of them, and John &s;aid he was filled with admira|tion for he &s;eemed to go with more flight and ea&s;e, he thought than ever he had &s;een any man before: And riding fa&s;t to overtake him, he thought he be|held a &s;mall white cloud as it were encompa&s;&s;ing his head; when he overtook him John &s;aid to him, Thou doe&s;t travel very fa&s;t; Peter replied, my ma|&s;ter told me before I left home, that he would give me hinds feet, and he hath performed his promi&s;e to me."</P>
<P>"When they came in &s;ight of Scarborough, Peter &s;aid, take me to a friend's hou&s;e if there is any there; John replied, I will take thee to the place where I lodge, and if thou art not ea&s;y there, I will go until we find a place, if it may be: &s;o John Richard&s;on took him to his lodgings, and ju&s;t as they entered the door, they heard &s;ome one go up &s;tairs, and anon the woman friend of the hou&s;e coming down with a neighbour of hers invited them to &s;it down; and in a &s;hort time, Peter &s;aith, Here is light and darkne&s;s, good and bad in this hou&s;e. The woman, after &s;he had got them &s;ome refre&s;h|ment, came and a&s;ked John, "who ha&s;t thou brought here?" A man of God, he replied. Having a meeting at Scarborough the next day, John Rich|ard&s;on &s;taid with him, and &s;aid he had good &s;er|vice; he al&s;o went with him to &s;everal friends hou&s;es there, and he frequently &s;pake his &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate of the families; but as they were near entering one
<PB N="180" REF="016223_0186_0F9BD3098714E978">
hou&s;e, Peter &s;topped, and &s;aid, my Ma&s;ter is not there, I will not go in, &s;o they turned away."</P>
<P>"Next morning at parting, John Richard&s;on a&s;ked him how he was prepared for money, telling him the journey was long; to whom Peter an&s;wered, I have enough, my Ma&s;ter told me I &s;hould not want, and now, a bit of bread, and &s;ome water from a brook, refre&s;hes me as much as a &s;et meal at a table: But John in&s;i&s;ted to &s;ee how much money he had, which was but two half-crowns; upon which John took a handfull of &s;mall pieces out of his pocket, and forced Peter to take them, telling him it was as free to him as his own, for &s;o the Lord had put it into his heart; thus they parted, John and the other friend returning home."</P>
<P>"In about two weeks afterwards the man's wife (before mentioned) died, as Peter had foretold; at that time, the &s;ame man had three &s;hips at &s;ea, his &s;on was ma&s;ter of one, a &s;econd &s;on was on board another, and in their voyages they were all wreck|ed or foundered and their cargoes chiefly lo&s;t; his two &s;ons and &s;everal of the hands being drowned: The man &s;oon after broke and could not pay his debts, but came to want bread before he died, though he had been in good circum&s;tances, if not very rich."</P>
<P>"John Richard&s;on further &s;aid, That after &s;ome time he heard Peter Gardner was dead in Cumber|land, on his return from Scotland, and being at|tached to him in near affection, he went to enquire how he ended."</P>
<P>"John Bow&s;tead a noted friend near Carli&s;le gave him an account that Peter had been through Scot|land, and came to Carli&s;le, and the &s;mall pox being there, he took the infection very &s;uddenly and lay ill with it: So J. Bow&s;tead went ju&s;t as the pock was coming out on him, and took him to his hou&s;e, they never came out kindly, but &s;welled him very
<PB N="181" REF="016223_0187_0F9BD30AA9A5ED20">
much, &s;o that he was blind, and died about the &s;eventh day, was quite &s;en&s;ible to the la&s;t, and knew the &s;tates of tho&s;e who came to &s;ee him: He had enough to pay his funeral charges."</P>
<P>On the twelfth of the &s;eventh month this year I left home, in order to attend a treaty to be held between the Indians and our Government at Ea&s;ton in Northampton County; and proceeded to Phila|delphia, where I was pre&s;ent at &s;everal conferences with friends, the Governor having declared his di&s;|like to their attendance at that treaty, or their di|&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves by giving the Indians any pre&s;ents; the re&s;ult was, that as mutual tokens of the revival of antient friend&s;hip had pa&s;&s;ed between them and the Indians, with a veiw to promote a general peace; it would be of bad con&s;equence now to neglect or decline attending on this import|ant occa&s;ion; tho' it was judged nece&s;&s;ary for friends to act with great caution. We therefore &s;et for|ward, and taking a meeting at Gwynnedd in the way, reached Ea&s;ton on fourth day the twenty-fir&s;t of the month, the Governor being got there about two hours before us; but did not enter on bu&s;ine&s;s that day.</P>
<P>Many friends from Philadelphia and other parts being here collected, we held a meeting on fifth day which was low and dull, things appearing very dark; in the afternoon the Indians with Teedyu&s;|cung their King, or chief man, went to the Go|vernor and &s;ignified the &s;incerity of their intentions to promote the good work of peace, when he de|livered &s;everal &s;trings and belts of wampum, in order to certify the full power and authority given to Teedyu&s;cung for that purpo&s;e, who al&s;o de&s;ired that as things had heretofore been mi&s;under&s;tood or forgotten, he might have the liberty to choo&s;e a clerk to take the minutes of the tran&s;actions at this treaty on behalf of the Indians, which was put off by the Governor at that time.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="016223_0188_0F9BD30B21ADE708">Next morning Teedyu&s;cung renewed the &s;ame reque&s;t, but was again put by: Then the Indians began to be very unea&s;y, from an apprehen&s;ion that &s;ome people from the Jer&s;ey &s;ide of the river were likely to ri&s;e, with a de&s;ign to de&s;troy them; but on going to conver&s;e with them, and giving them &s;ome pipes and tobacco, which they were told was a pre&s;ent from friends, they became more quiet, and &s;eemingly pacified; this day and the next there was little bu&s;ine&s;s done.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t day the twenty-fourth of the month, friends held a public meeting, in the Treaty-booth to pretty good &s;atisfaction, to which a great num|ber of people came, two friends having acceptable &s;ervice therein; in the afternoon friends met again; but there &s;eemed &s;o great a cloud over the meeting, by rea&s;on of a raw carele&s;s &s;pirit prevailing over the minds of the people, as though there was no God, notwith&s;tanding his judgments are &s;o con&s;picuous. e&s;pecially in the&s;e parts of the country, that life did not ari&s;e in this meeting, about &s;un&s;et this even|ing we heard that the Mohawk Indians had re|que&s;ted to have a fire made to dance round, which the governor allowed, as he had the evening before to the Delawares, with both which we were very unea&s;y, as the tendency thereof was to make the Indians drunk; but no endeavours of ours could prevent it.</P>
<P>On &s;econd day morning the Governor agreed to allow the Indian King to choo&s;e him&s;elf a clerk, which he did, and about one o'clock that day the treaty was fir&s;t opened in public, when Teedyu&s;|cung was de&s;ired fully to inform with an open heart, wherein he apprehended the Indians had been defrauded by the Proprietaries, to which he an&s;wered that he would to-morrow; but they mu&s;t fir&s;t clean up the blood, (as he expre&s;&s;ed it) and bury the dead bodies: Next day being again met,
<PB N="183" REF="016223_0189_0F9BD31457356FD0">
the King &s;aid, "that according to his word, he had now met &s;ome of the &s;everal nations to do what they could for &s;ettling peace; but now in the fir&s;t place he had &s;een, and con&s;idered the black cloud that hung over the land, the blood and bodies of the people who had &s;uffered," and then &s;aid, "I have gathered up the &s;tained leaves, the blood and dead bodies, and looked round about, when all &s;eemed terrible, that I could find no place to hide them; but looking up, I &s;aw the great and good Spirit above; let us heartily join in prayer to him, that he may give us power to bury all the&s;e things out of our &s;ight, that neither the evil &s;pirit, nor any wicked per&s;on may ever be able to rai&s;e them; that we may love like brethren, and the &s;un may &s;hine clear upon us, that we, our wives, our young men and children may rejoice in a la&s;ting peace, that we may eat the fruits of the earth, and they may do us good, &s;o that we may enjoy peace in the day time, and at night lay down and &s;leep in it." Gave a belt of &s;eventeen rows of wampum.</P>
<P>By another belt he told the Governor, that he took him by one hand, and the five nations of In|dians and their allies took him by the other, there|fore &s;aid he, let us all &s;tand as one man, with one heart and one mind, and join in this good work of peace. When we intend to lift or remove a great weight, we mu&s;t be &s;trong, if all do not exert them&s;elves we can never do it; but if all heartily join, it is ea&s;y to remove it, our forefathers did not proceed right when they met together, they looked at the earth and things pre&s;ent, which will &s;oon pa&s;s out of our &s;ight; but did not look forward to the good of po&s;terity. Let us &s;et out right, and do better than they did, that a peace may be &s;ettled which may la&s;t to our children.</P>
<P>He next acquainted the Governor, that one of the me&s;&s;engers who had gone on a late me&s;&s;age
<PB N="184" REF="016223_0190_0F9BD31585E6A2A8">
to the Indians a far off, (meaning Mo&s;es Tatamy's &s;on) was &s;hot on his return by one of our young men, and lay in a dangerous condition; and by a &s;tring of wampum in&s;i&s;ted, that if he died, the other &s;hould be tried by our law, and &s;uffer death al&s;o; and that &s;ome of their people &s;hould be pre|&s;ent, to be able to inform the other nations of In|dians of the ju&s;tice done. He al&s;o revived the an|cient agreement, that if any of them &s;hould commit the like offence, the criminal &s;hould be delivered up to be tried according to our laws, and &s;uffer death in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>On fourth day there was no public treaty, things &s;eemed in much confu&s;ion and very dull; but friends kept quiet; the next day I found my&s;elf much indi&s;|po&s;ed, and therefore thought it be&s;t to leave Ea&s;ton before the treaty ended; but before I left it friends had a &s;olemn opportunity together, at which time I thought I &s;aw, that the working of the dark revengeful &s;pirit, which oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ures of peace, was one rea&s;on why friends were &s;o baptized into di&s;tre&s;s and &s;uffering, of which I made &s;ome mention to friends, and that if they kept quiet, the clouds as to them would &s;omewhat break away; Daniel Stanton had a &s;olemn time in &s;upplication. After this meeting taking leave of friends, I rode to Richland, and tho' my di&s;temper increa&s;ed and I was very ill, I pur&s;ued my journey the next day, and the day following reached Philadelphia, where I was carefully attended through a time of tedious and clo&s;e affliction, my dear wife coming to me in my illne&s;s was al&s;o taken with the &s;ame di&s;order, that we were not able to move homewards until the twenty-third of the eighth month, but through the goodne&s;s of kind providence in &s;upporting us, got to our own habitation the next day in the evening, where after about a week's &s;tay I &s;et out again to attend the meeting for &s;ufferings in Philadelphia,
<PB N="185" REF="016223_0191_0F9BD315992F7E98">
and tho' very weak, got there, after tarrying part of three days in town, went forward in order to attend the monthly-meetings in Bucks County, of which I had a view while I lay &s;ick, when it ap|peared to me the way to recover my &s;trength was to be faithful to every di&s;covery of duty; according|ly in company with &s;everal other friends appointed by the yearly-meeting, I vi&s;ited the &s;everal monthly meetings in that county, in &s;ome of which a good degree of the Divine pre&s;ence being felt, was cau&s;e of thankfulne&s;s; tho' at one of them we had &s;ome remarkable clo&s;e work, both in the time of wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>Returning to Philadelphia I perceived my&s;elf much recovered, &s;pent five days there attending meetings as they came in cour&s;e; and then went to Newtown meeting in Che&s;ter County, which was &s;mall, there being an evident &s;lackne&s;s of attending week day meetings; from thence I went to Uwch|lan, to the marriage of William Trimble and Phebe Thomas, which was a good meeting, where I met my dear wife on her way to the yearly-meeting at Philadelphia; and after attending a meeting at Mer|rion, we went into the city the next evening; our friends Thomas Gawthrop, Samuel Spavold, Wil|liam Reckitt and others from Great Britain, al&s;o Thomas Nichol&s;on from North-Carolina, were at this yearly-meeting, which was large and &s;atisfacto|ry, holding from the &s;eventeenth to the twenty-fourth of the ninth month, 1757.</P>
<P>Here I may note, that before I left home to at|tend the late Indian treaty at Ea&s;ton: In my &s;leep I thought I was riding Ea&s;tward in the twilight, and &s;aw a light before me towards fun-ri&s;ing, which did not appear to be a common light, but &s;oon ob&s;erved the appearance of &s;omething therein, whereat the bea&s;t that I rode was much affrighted and would have ran from it, which I knew would be in vain;
<PB N="186" REF="016223_0192_0F9BD31643C65AB8">
for I took it to be an Angel, who&s;e motion was as &s;wift as thought, &s;o rather &s;topt and reined in my bea&s;t towards it; it was encompa&s;&s;ed with a bright|ne&s;s like a rainbow, with a large loo&s;e garment of the &s;ame colour down to the feet; it rather &s;eemed to move even along than to walk, and then &s;tood &s;till in the mid&s;t of many curious &s;tacks of corn; it was of a human form about &s;even feet high (as I thought,) and &s;miling on me, a&s;ked where I was go|ing; I &s;aid towards yonder building, which I thought was an elegant one directly before me; it &s;eemed to approve my way and vani&s;hed upwards. Then I awakened and had particularly to remember the complexion of this angelic apparition, which was not much different from one of the Indians clean wa&s;hed from his grea&s;e and filth; remembering my dream very fre&s;h, when I had &s;een the Indians at the treaty, and had heard &s;ome matters remarkably &s;poken by &s;ome particulars of them, I was made to believe it was not unrea&s;onable to conclude, that the Lord was in them by his good Spirit, and that all colours were equal to him, who gave life and being to all mankind; we &s;hould therefore be care|full to examine deeper than the outward appearance, with a tender regard to &s;tation and education, if we de&s;ire to be pre&s;erved from error in judgment.</P>
<P><HI>The following Sentences being delivered in two of his public te&s;timonies, were &s;oon after committed to writing by a friend who was pre&s;ent, and appearing worthy to be further pre&s;erved are now communicated, &mdash;viz.</HI></P>
<P>In a fir&s;t day meeting at Ea&s;t Nottingham the nineteenth of the twelfth month 1756, he expre&s;&s;ed nearly as follows.</P>
<P><Q>I felt my mind in this meeting remarkably drawn from outward ob&s;ervation, and was com|manded
<PB N="187" REF="016223_0193_0F9BD3174D9566D8">
to center in deep and awful &s;ilence, wherein there was &s;uch a flowing of good will to mankind, as is &s;carcely to be uttered by tongue; but thus centering with diligent attention, I thought I felt a &s;trong power of darkne&s;s and &s;tupid ignorance, &s;eemingly combined to make war again&s;t this &s;olemn attention of mind; yet after patiently waiting &s;ome time, to my comfort I felt a &s;ecret victory, and the darkne&s;s vani&s;hed: Then, a voice was uttered in me attended (I thought) with Divine authority thus, <HI>I will bow the inhabitants of the earth, and particularly of this land, and I will make them fear and reverence me, either in mercy or in judgment;</HI> hereupon a pro&s;pect immediately opened to my view of a day of calamity and &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s which was ap|proaching, and in which the carele&s;s and &s;tupid profe&s;&s;ors, who are ea&s;y, and not concerned to properly wor&s;hip and adore the almighty, and have not laboured to witne&s;s their foundation to be laid on him the immoveable Rock, will be greatly &s;urpri&s;ed with fearfulne&s;s; and on the behalf of &s;uch, a piercing cry and lamentation ran through me, thus, <HI>Alas for the day! Alas for the day! Woe is me!</HI> (&s;everal times repeated) and a voice which &s;eemed to be connected with the foregoing, &s;aid further, yet once more faith the Lord, I &s;hake not the earth only but al&s;o heaven: Not only the &s;ituation of tho&s;e that know not any place of &s;afety or refuge, that which is out|ward and earthly; but al&s;o tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ume a higher place and in their &s;pecious appearances and fal&s;e pretences among&s;t men, do value them|&s;elves on their a&s;&s;umed goodne&s;s, and would fain be accounted of the highe&s;t rank, and even place them&s;elves among the &s;aints, and are by &s;ome accounted as &s;tars in the firmament; yet in the
<PB N="188" REF="016223_0194_0F9BD317D91831C0">
day of my power wherein I will &s;hake the hea|vens, and the earth, tho&s;e &s;tars &s;hall fall to the ground.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the opening, &s;omething within me was ready to &s;ay, amen &s;o be it, O Lord Almighty, cut &s;hort thy work in the earth, in order that thou may'&s;t put an end to &s;in, and fini&s;h tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that thy fear, and the knowledge of thee, may cover the earth, as the waters cover the &s;ea. Wherefore, my friends, the fervent de&s;ire of my &s;oul is, that all pre&s;ent may with diligence la|bour to have your minds truly centred and hum|bled before God, to know a being fixed on that foundation which only &s;tandeth &s;ure, that in a time of outward di&s;tre&s;s, which perhaps may come in your day, ye may find a place of &s;afety and refuge.</Q>
All which with more to the like effect, was delivered in great humility and broken|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>At a week day meeting at the &s;ame place, the &s;eventeenth of the &s;econd month 1757, &s;everal per|&s;ons by un&s;ea&s;onable coming in had interrupted the quiet of the meeting, he gave a &s;uitable caution in that re&s;pect, in gentle winning terms, reminding tho&s;e met of the awfulne&s;s and &s;olemnity which &s;hould attend us when we approach the pre&s;ence of him who is mo&s;t Holy; and in what reverence, fear and care, we ought to come together, not forgetting the hour appointed; and then expre&s;&s;ed nearly as follows.</P>
<P><Q>A certain &s;entence has been pre&s;ented to the view of my mind, which &s;eemed to contain a gentle engaging caution, and matter of in&s;tructi|on to me, attended with &s;weetne&s;s; which was, <HI>Work while it is day.</HI> Friends, this is our day, wherein we ought to be diligent and indu&s;trious, in the light of the day we may &s;ee, and under|&s;tand

how to work, and what to do, that at the conclu&s;ion we may obtain from the Ma&s;ter of the day, who dwelleth in Light, the an&s;wer of well done; for the night will come, wherein no man can work: We are now favoured with liberty in this our day, to a&s;&s;emble together for wor&s;hip unmole&s;ted; and my hearty de&s;ire is, that we may properly improve this mercy; for the time to &s;ome of us may come, before our day in this life is clo&s;ed, wherein this priviledge, may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be taken from us; &s;omething in me would be ready to &s;ay, The Lord forbid that &s;hould be the ca&s;e; but by rea&s;on of the great declen&s;ion which has over&s;pread the church, I hardly dare to expect any other: Oh may we therefore be careful to prize the mercy of God, and endeavour to gain an inheritance in the light, that when night overtakes, and darkne&s;s as to the outward may hang over us, we may be fa|voured to withdraw into the &s;ure hiding place, and know a quiet habitation!</Q></P>

<P>HAVING &s;ome drawings in my mind to vi&s;it the meetings of friends in the Counties of Philadelphia and Bucks, being al&s;o under an ap|pointment of the yearly-meeting to join with &s;ome others in a vi&s;it to the monthly-meetings; in order to

proceed on my &s;ervice, I acquainted our monthly-meeting at Nottingham, with who&s;e concurrence I left home on the third of the twelfth month 1757, accompanied by a near relation, and attended Dar|by meeting on fir&s;t day, wherein tho' life and the power of Truth &s;eemed to be low, I thought the humble waiters were encouraged; we went to the evening meeting in Philadelphia, next morning at|tended the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, and the day following a meeting at the Bank, al&s;o a meet|ing for &s;ufferings, and on fourth day returned to Darby to their monthly-meeting, where we found friends under a &s;trait about di&s;owning one among them, who denied the Divinity of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; on whom they had bellowed much labour to convince him of his error, the meet|ing ended well; the company of the friends who attended it being acceptable and of &s;ervice: We were next day at Haverford monthly-meeting held at Radnor, where the lively exerci&s;e of the discipline appeared to be very low, yet I was glad I was there; during the time of the bu&s;ine&s;s, feeling a concern on my mind to appoint a meeting at Haverford to be held the next day, I propo&s;ed it for concurrence, which being readily agreed to, we attended there accordingly, and had a large meeting much to &s;atisfaction, having great peace in ob&s;erving the motion of truth re&s;pecting this appointment; on the following day accompanied by my friend Hugh Evans, I vi&s;ited &s;ome ancient friends, who by rea|&s;on of old age and indi&s;po&s;ition could not get out to meetings, wherein I was favoured with that peace, which I have often experienced to attend the acceptable work of vi&s;iting the afflicted: On fir&s;t day after a &s;atisfactory meeting at Merrion, I went to the evening meeting in Philadelphia, in which truth favoured with a degree of openne&s;s, to the in&s;truction and comfort of many: On third

day afternoon, accompanied by my brother W^m^. Brown, went forward to Richland monthly-meeting held on the fifth day, where we had &s;ome clo&s;e hard work, which generally happens when a life|le&s;s formal &s;pirit hath the prevalence in managing the affairs of the church, for want of feeling after and waiting for the true authority, even the power of God, yet we were glad tnat we were there; from thence my brother returned home, the re&s;t of us going to an appointed meeting at Plum&s;tead, which tho' the weather was &s;everely cold, was large and comfortable, in the &s;en&s;e whereof we were thankful to the author of all good; the meeting next day at Buckingham was &s;mall but &s;atisfactory; I have often ob&s;erved, that the &s;everity of the wea|ther is not a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for the Lord's panting children to neglect public wor&s;hip, which is a duty incumbent on us and due to his glorious name; at Wright&s;town meeting the next day the ma&s;ter of our A&s;&s;emblies was plea&s;ed to appear in an eminent manner, to the comfort of the poor, in&s;truction of the enquirers, rebuke of the back&s;liders, and edifi|cation of many; for which the &s;acrifice of thank&s;|giving and prai&s;e was offered to him, who alone is worthy for ever; after this meeting I felt the value of that peace, which by the humble is better felt than expre&s;&s;ed: We had next a good meeting at Makefield, at which were many &s;eeking tender young people; then attended the Falls preparative meeting, which was &s;atisfactory, a comfortable de|gree of unity &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among friends; our next meeting was at Bri&s;tol, in which after a dark di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing time in &s;ilence, what I had to communicate was introduced by a que&s;tion thus, <HI>Are you found in faith and practice?</HI> and I was led to &s;et forth, "that to profe&s;s and acknowledge even &s;acred Truths, without a life of &s;elf-denial with an an&s;werable ho|ne&s;t conduct, was no way &s;ufficient; that being a

dead faith, which produceth not good works in him who faith he believeth; &s;hewing what &s;tumbling blocks, the nominal profe&s;&s;ors are, who by their example plainly manife&s;t, that they are not po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors of what they profe&s;s to have, and are the great|e&s;t enemies the truth hath, which I was doubtful was the ca&s;e with &s;ome among them;" I had peace in this plain dealing; our next was a laborious meeting at Byberry, yet yielded a degree of the &s;ame peace; a friend afterwards told me that the Hate of the meeting was clearly &s;poken to, which I relate not for any prai&s;e to man; but that it was an additional confirmation of the Lord's &s;ufficiency to his own work, and when we are weak, fooli&s;h or contemptible in our own e&s;teem, his &s;trength appears, and his wi&s;dom in&s;pires with true know|ledge, whereby he magnifieth him&s;elf; we went home with our friend James Thornton and next day to Hor&s;ham, where was a large and good meeting, after which we had a comfortable time in the family of John Cadwalader; next day we attended the monthly-meeting at Abington in company with Sa|muel Ea&s;tburn and Jo&s;eph White; we found things low here, becau&s;e of a want of that &s;trength in which &s;tands the authority of the church; it is only the pure wi&s;dom from above, that pre&s;erves friends in peace, meekne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, and unanimity in the di&s;tribution of right ju&s;tice and judgment in the church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>We were next day at Gwynedd monthly-meet|ing, which was a precious time through the power of that &s;acred name, which is as ointment poured forth, the favour whereof continued thro' both wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, in which the faithful were mutually comforted; we from thence went to Ellen Evans's, and had an evening-meeting, &s;ome of the neighbours coming in, &s;everal friends were much

enlarged in coun&s;el, and the opportunity ended in &s;olemn prayer and thank&s;giving.</P>
<P>We went from thence to Exeter monthly-meet|ing, which ended to &s;atisfaction in the main; then home with our friend Ellis Hugh, where Jo&s;eph White and Sam^l^. Ea&s;tburn left us to return home|wards; my companion and I proceeding to Reading, had a public meeting in the Court-hou&s;e, which I thought was pretty well con&s;idering the company, many loo&s;e people attending; but Truth &s;eemed to come into dominion and quieted them, that the meeting ended in a degree of awful &s;weetne&s;s; On fir&s;t day, being al&s;o the fir&s;t of the new-year 1758, we were at Maiden Creek meeting, which altho' a low time, afforded peace and comfort, from a pro&s;pect that there were among the youth in par|ticular, &s;ome true branches of the vine of Life, who therefore could not be &s;atisfied without the living &s;ap from the Holy root, and in the Lord's time would be favoured therewith, if there was a patient waiting for that &s;pringing &s;ea&s;on; we re|turned to Reading that evening, to a meeting held by appointment at a friend's hou&s;e for the members of our &s;ociety in that town, in the attendance of which I found peace; cro&s;&s;ing the river Schuylkill we were next day at Robin&s;on or the Fore&s;t meet|ing, after which I was much humbled in a &s;en&s;e of the great conde&s;cention and mercy of the Lord our God, who was plea&s;ed to renew the reaches of his power to &s;everal, who had many years made profe&s;&s;ion of the pure Truth, and yet dwelt in that which is impure, as drinking to exce&s;s and other evils, &s;ome of whom I knew, but did not know that they were there till the meeting was over; the weak were &s;trengthened and the humble &s;eekers encouraged, and great love flowed towards the youth: Returning again over Schuylkill we went to

that called Evans's meeting, which was very open for doctrine, &s;everal not of our &s;ociety being pre&s;ent: The fir&s;t &s;entences that appeared in my view were, <HI>many are called, but few are cho&s;en,</HI> attended with &s;uch weakne&s;s, and &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of my own fool|i&s;hne&s;s and inability for handling that &s;ubject, that I was afraid, becau&s;e I had a &s;ecret apprehen&s;ion that &s;ome would incline to make an advantage of tho&s;e words, <HI>but few are cho&s;en,</HI> in applying them to &s;trengthen them&s;elves in the corrupt manner in which they hold election; but it appeared that the words, <HI>all have not obeyed,</HI> was the rea&s;on why &s;o few are cho&s;en: My mouth was opened in fear, even to trembling, yet with a &s;ecret hope and con|fidence that the Lord would, be mouth and wi&s;dom, with de&s;ires that he would bind my attention to his own immediate in&s;truction, that the language of his Spirit might be only uttered by me, and he was plea&s;ed to magnify his own Truth in the opening of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages: I give this hint, that they who are concerned in the mini&s;try may humbly tru&s;t in God, and not lean to their fears, knowledge, ex|perience or wi&s;dom, in opening the my&s;teries of the Go&s;pel, but confide in the key of David, which when it opens none can &s;hut. Next day we were at Providence or Perkiomin meeting, which tho' poor, and truth low, peace was afterwards mea&s;u|rably enjoyed, from an evidence of having been hone&s;t according to the ability given; and the day following at Plymouth, faithful friends were com|forted in the gracious conde&s;cention of our holy head, who was plea&s;ed to favour with the abound|ings of the life and love of Truth; we then re|turned to Philadelphia with thankful hearts for the evidence of peace.</P>

<PB N="195" REF="016223_0201_0F9BCF3C0E758DA8">
time to vi&s;it that meeting; a &s;en&s;e of the declen&s;ion of friends in this place, both in re&s;pect to numbers and the life of religion, was cau&s;e of heavine&s;s of heart, but having performed my vi&s;it in faithful|ne&s;s according to ability, returned with a degree of peace to the evening meeting in the city, which was comfortable, &s;taying there until the fifth day of the week, in which time I attended the u&s;ual meet|ings, one with the Negroes much to &s;atisfaction, and al&s;o the meeting for &s;ufferings I got &s;afe home on &s;eventh day the fourteenth of the fir&s;t month, having travelled in this journey about four hundred and ten miles.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;econd of the &s;econd month, I again left home in order to attend the quarterly-meeting at Burlington, and &s;ome particular meet|ings in New-Jer&s;ey, as well on account of the year|ly-meeting's appointment, as my own &s;en&s;e of duty, of which I had the approbation of our monthly-meeting &s;ignified by a minute; in my way I at|tended the monthly-meeting in Philadelphia with &s;ome degree of &s;atisfaction; then taking Che&s;ter or Adam's meeting in New-Jer&s;ey, reached Burling|ton on fir&s;t day evening, the next day being the quarterly-meeting, at which with William Horne and my brother W^m^. Brown I had &s;ome &s;ervice; after &s;taying the youth's meeting, they left me and I went to a meeting on fourth day at a School-hou&s;e, where &s;everal friends met, al&s;o divers others who perhaps had not been at any place of wor&s;hip for &s;ometime, and were ea&s;y about religion, to whom it became my concern to &s;hew how di&s;agreeable and loath&s;ome that &s;tate was, from Rev. iii. 15. <HI>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; &s;o then, becau&s;e thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will &s;pue thee out of my mouth.</HI>" It opened to me that a lukewarm condition, to hold a profe&s;&s;ion of religion &s;o as to take it ill not to be thought a chri&s;|tian,
<PB N="196" REF="016223_0202_0F9BCF3CCF109528">
but at the &s;ame time to remain ea&s;y and not in earne&s;t to experience the life, virtue, and power of chri&s;tianity; not &s;o cold as to forget the name, nor &s;o hot or zealous as to witne&s;s the life of true religion, was very di&s;plea&s;ing to the Almighty. A good degree of power attended the opening, and in treating on that pa&s;&s;age, with much love to &s;uch lukewarm profe&s;&s;ors, which reached and tendered &s;everal beyond expectation; but no prai&s;e to man, tho' he may will or run, but to God who &s;heweth mercy.</P>
<P>At Che&s;terfield monthly-meeting my friend John Woolman met me the next day; a raw company attending on account of a propo&s;al or two for mar|riage, which I &s;uppo&s;e they expected to be there pre&s;ented; it was a time &s;omewhat low and di&s;tre&s;s|ing: The advice of the yearly-meeting not being here enough ob&s;erved, which is again&s;t allowing &s;uch who are not members of our &s;ociety to &s;it in our meetings for di&s;cipline, unle&s;s they are nearly related to the parties concerned, of which that meeting was mode&s;tly reminded; I was al&s;o grieved that matters were introduced too much at the judg|ment or plea&s;ure of individuals, by rea&s;on that they are not in the practice of holding preparative meet|ings, the &s;ervice of which, was particularly recom|mended to their con&s;ideration; I had &s;ome reward of peace in having attended this meeting: We were next at a meeting in Trenton with a few friends whom the &s;pirit of the world (I thought) had much laid wa&s;te; there &s;eemed more oppenne&s;s towards a few of other &s;ocieties pre&s;ent, &s;ome of whom were tendered by Truth's te&s;timony, which &s;eemed to reach the witne&s;s in them; at Bordentown meet|ing next day, many were made thankful, the Di|vine pre&s;ence being felt among us; from hence J. Woolman returned home, and John Sykes accom|panied me to Upper-Springfield, where the meet|ing
<PB N="197" REF="016223_0203_0F9BCF3F164F6D00">
was large, and through the Lord's mercy, open and &s;atisfactory, the te&s;timony of Truth flowing in his love towards the youth, many were tendered thereby, the faithful were encouraged and the negli|gent warned; after which I went to Burlington to attend that monthly-meeting, then to the burial of Margaret Butcher at Mansfield, which was a labo|rious painful meeting compo&s;ed of a mixed multi|tude, yet &s;omething of an evidence attended truth's te&s;timony, &s;o that the meeting ended with &s;olidity; from thence I went to Peter Harvey's and was thank|ful for the enjoyment of a peaceful quiet mind, tho' poor; next day was at Old-Springfield meeting, which was &s;low and late in gathering, dull and heavy in &s;itting, as will be the ca&s;e, when and where&s;oever the life and power of religion is want|ing, or not carefully &s;ought after and waited for, by tho&s;e who profe&s;s it, which was ob&s;erved to them in the love of truth, and in the &s;implicity and plain|ne&s;s thereof, &s;o that I left this meeting with a heavy heart, not from a &s;en&s;e of any omi&s;&s;ion of duty on my part; but le&s;t they &s;hould too &s;oon forget what manner of per&s;ons they &s;aw them&s;elves to be in the Light, that di&s;covers and an&s;wers the witne&s;s, as face an&s;wers face in a gla&s;s. Then taking meetings at Mountholly, Rancocus, and vi&s;iting the widow of Peter Andrews, I was at a large meeting at Eve&s;ham on fir&s;t day following; but the expectati|ons of the people being much outward, occa&s;ioned a painful deep waiting a con&s;iderable time, or at lea&s;t I thought &s;o, when at length I felt &s;ome pre&s;|&s;ure on my mind to &s;tand up, which as I followed carefully, Truth opened into the &s;tate of the meeting to my admiration, that I was enabled therein with an innocent boldne&s;s to attend thereto in &s;peaking, which yielded me great peace after the meeting, and I was thankful for that opportunity. Next day I attended Haddonfield monthly-meeting, at which
<PB N="198" REF="016223_0204_0F9BCF3FD57A5A20">
were Samuel Nottingham and William Horne, who&s;e company was comfortable and of advantage to the meeting. I then vi&s;ited the meetings at Pile&s;grove, Alloways Creek, Greenwich, lower Al|loways Creek, Salem, and one at Raccoon Creek, to which many &s;ober people came not profe&s;&s;ing with us, al&s;o a large, and I believe to &s;ome a &s;ati&s;|factory meeting at Woodberry, the &s;tate whereof opened pretty clearly, the humble being in&s;tructed, but I was &s;en&s;ible of an oppo&s;ition here to &s;ome part of what I had to deliver to a &s;elf-righteous &s;tate, yet through the mercy of our gracious Lord, I left this meeting with an evidence of peace, and an affectionate heart yearning towards them, then went to Haddonfield to attend the quarterly-meet|ing for Glouce&s;ter and Salem Counties, and from thence to the General Spring-meeting at Philadel|phia, after which I returned home, having been out five weeks and three days.</P>
<P>After this journey I did not go much abroad for more than a year, except to attend our quarterly meeting, and the yearly and general Spring-meet|ing at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>In the year 1759, I had &s;ome drawings in my mind to vi&s;it a few meetings in Maryland and Vir|ginia, al&s;o the yearly-meeting at We&s;t-River; in which having the concurrence of our monthly-meeting, I left home on the twenty-eighth of the fifth month and next day was at Gunpowder meet-meeting; then at Elkridge with a few friends and divers not profe&s;&s;ing with us, among&s;t whom there was an openne&s;s to hear the te&s;timony of Truth de|clared; but for want of a &s;teady walking in the profe&s;&s;ors thereof, it &s;eems in a great mea&s;ure laid wa&s;te; that night I lodged at the hou&s;e of a kind man, but have to remark that natural affability in any one, unle&s;s it is &s;weetened by the bapti&s;m of the Spirit of Truth, is of little value; on fifth day
<PB N="199" REF="016223_0205_0F9BCF409F22AC30">
I was at a new-meeting hou&s;e at Indian Spring with a few friends, &s;ome of whom I fear, &s;carcely know what they profe&s;s, the next had a meeting at Sa|muel Plummer's hou&s;e at Patuxent to &s;atisfaction, and on &s;eventh day the yearly-meeting at We&s;t-River began, which held until fourth day following, which was in the main the mo&s;t open and &s;atisfacto|ry meeting I was ever at in that place; I thought a di&s;po&s;ition rather prevailed among the younger &s;ort, to attend to the di&s;cipline more clo&s;ely than in times pa&s;t. Then taking a meeting at Sandy Spring, I proceeded to Fairfax, being about forty miles, where I had a comfortable meeting on fir&s;t day, for which the hearts of many were made thankful to the au|thor of all good, the &s;ame day we had al&s;o a &s;ati&s;|factory opportunity in Mahlon Janney's family, his mother being indi&s;po&s;ed, and the next day attended Monaqua&s;y meeting in Maryland, where truth is at a low ebb, through the conduct of &s;ome un|faithful profe&s;&s;ors; our next was a precious meeting with a few &s;incere friends at Bu&s;h Creek, that even|ing I went to William Farquar's, having a meeting at Pipe Creek next day, which was pretty open, and &s;atisfactory and one the day following at Pe|tap&s;co Fore&s;t among&s;t a withered people. Alas! to profe&s;s the truth and not po&s;&s;e&s;s it in &s;anctification of &s;pirit, makes little meetings feel de&s;olate; from thence I returned home to our monthly-meeting, being ab&s;ent nineteen days and rode near three hundred and fifty miles, Samuel England being my companion.</P>
<P>In this year I was al&s;o engaged with my friend John Woolman in vi&s;iting &s;ome active members of our &s;ociety, who held &s;laves, fir&s;t in the city of Philadelphia, and in other places; al&s;o in New-Jer&s;ey, in which &s;ervice we were enabled to go through &s;ome heavy labours, and were favoured with peace; Divine Love in a tender &s;ympathy
<PB N="200" REF="016223_0206_0F9BCF4155F3ACB8">
prevailing at times, with a hope that the&s;e endea|vours would not be in vain.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd month 1760, I acquainted our monthly-meeting, that in order to proceed in per|forming the appointment of the yearly-meeting, having al&s;o a draught in my own mind, I had an inclination to vi&s;it &s;ome meetings up the river Dela|ware, particularly the monthly-meeting of King|wood in New-Jer&s;ey, with which having the appro|bation of friends, I &s;et out from home on the twenty-&s;ixth of the fifth month following, and reach|ed the Bank meeting in Philadelphia the next day; from thence proceeded to the quarterly-meeting for Bucks County held at Buckingham, where tho' things were low, the affairs of the church were tran&s;acted in a good degree of amity and peace; it was a large meeting, there being a great appearance of young people, &s;ome very hopeful, who in the love of truth were exhorted to come up in their places, by learning di&s;cipline of the author thereof, viz. <HI>the Spirit of Truth,</HI> and they were cautioned again&s;t that very unbecoming and hurtful practice, tho' too common, of going out after wor&s;hip, and &s;tanding without in companies talking when they &s;hould keep their places in the meeting, which &s;hould quietly and &s;olidly proceed on the bu&s;ine&s;s coming before it; heavenly love was felt by the tender in &s;pirit, which I hope will be remembered by many; the next day the general or youth's-meet|ing was large, open and &s;atisfactory in the main; for which the name of the Lord was prai&s;ed. Next day I &s;pent in vi&s;iting a widow, al&s;o other aged and infirm friends, in the performance of which duty I had &s;ome &s;atisfaction, and on fir&s;t day was at Plum&s;tead meeting, which was large and very com|fortable, the divine pre&s;ence being felt, the power of Truth prevailed to the tendering of many; but &s;uch favour being not of him that willeth or run|neth,
<PB N="201" REF="016223_0207_0F9BCF4214252E48">
but of God that &s;heweth mercy, to him be|longeth the prai&s;e of all, who is worthly for ever. In the evening I attended a meeting at a School-hou&s;e near Samuel Ea&s;tburn's, in which I had &s;ome particular &s;ervice, the &s;tates of many pre&s;ent being very clearly opened before them in the love of the Go&s;pel, which made deep impre&s;&s;ion on &s;ome who were much broken, and I believe it would be as dew on their hearts, if they would remain enough in the valley of humility.</P>
<P>I was the next day at Buckingham monthly-meeting, which in the time of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;uffered much by the prevalence of a talkative noi&s;y &s;pirit, which mightily darkens coun&s;el in tho&s;e who give way to it, and leads into doubtful and trifling di&s;|putations; &s;o that I left that meeting with pain of heart, in a &s;en&s;e that the time had been &s;o lo&s;t that &s;everal weighty matters could not be brought under con&s;ideration to advantage, which were therefore continued until the next month.</P>
<P>Wright&s;town monthly-meeting on third day was more &s;atisfactory, the &s;pirit for di&s;cipline rather reviving, and I hope a de&s;ire among the youth at lea&s;t for an improvement; it too frequently is the ca&s;e, that &s;ome of the elderly &s;ort are &s;o bigotted to their old forms and cu&s;toms, that they will &s;carce|ly trouble them&s;elves to examine whether the&s;e cu&s;|toms are agreeable to the te&s;timony of Truth, or whether through inattention they have not &s;werved and fallen &s;hort in various matters that now occa&s;ion a difficulty in the churches, which difficulties mu&s;t be laboured under for a &s;ea&s;on by the baptized members, who neverthele&s;s, as they keep their places will grow &s;tronger.</P>
<P>Accompanied by my friend Thomas Ro&s;s I at|tended the Falls monthly-meeting, wherein I was comforted from a &s;en&s;e that a tender people were among them, tho' they felt a time of dearth, whom
<PB N="202" REF="016223_0208_0F9BCF42D265ABC8">
the Lord would in his own time water as his pecu|liar heritage; but this comfort was heavily balla&s;ted from a &s;ecret fear attending me, that there were among them &s;ome, who like the heath in the de&s;ert, know not when good cometh, &s;uch who were ea&s;y in a dead form, and contented with a name, ne|glecting to wait for that transforming power, which would renew into the image and life of the Son of God; to whom in the love, and plainne&s;s of the Go&s;pel, I was con&s;trained to clear my&s;elf; the meet|ing for di&s;cipline was pretty open and ended in a good degree of &s;weetne&s;s; we went home with the wife of Jo&s;eph White, who was then on a religious vi&s;it to friends in Europe, and had a comfortable &s;ea&s;on in the family with the children, &s;he appear|ing to be re&s;igned in the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band, her &s;pirit being &s;weetened with the truth in inno|cent quietude.</P>
<P>At Middletown monthly-meeting the next day truth &s;eemed to be low, but we had &s;ome &s;ervice in the di&s;cipline, that I came away with peace, and the day following in company with Jo&s;hua Ely went to Jacob Bird&s;hal's in Amwell town&s;hip New-Jer&s;ey, and had a meeting in his barn, which being a wet time) was &s;mall; there are few here who profe&s;s with us, &s;ome of whom &s;eem to have nothing more than the name. Next morning we called at the hou&s;e of an old profe&s;&s;or, he and his wife were both ancient but full of talk; I felt a de&s;ire to vi&s;it them, and had a full time to clear my&s;elf in a clo&s;e and plain manner, tho' in love to them. After which going to Kingwood or Bethlehem attended two meetings there on fir&s;t day, when truth favoured in opening the &s;tates of the people in mercy to many, which may be of advantage if rightly remembered; then proceeding to the Drowned-lands &s;o called, had there a meeting with a few profe&s;&s;ors who &s;eemed too much withered, then taking another at Paulin's
<PB N="203" REF="016223_0209_0F9BCF43944CA3D8">
Kiln to pretty good &s;atisfaction, returned to King|wood monthly-meeting than held at Hardwick; &s;everal hopeful young people belong thereto, the meeting was comfortable, friends rejoicing in the company one of another, and in the Lord for his merciful regard; next day I returned to Bethlehem, and from thence to Gwynedd meeting on fir&s;t day, after which I rode to Uwchlan, about twenty-eight miles, from thence home, where I found all well, having been ab&s;ent three weeks and rode about four hundred and &s;ixteen miles in this journey.</P>
<P>Having a draught of love and a motion therein to vi&s;it the monthly and particular meetings within our own quarter, on the We&s;t &s;ide of Su&s;quehanna river, with the concurrence of our monthly-meeting on that occa&s;ion, I &s;et out from home on the &s;even|teenth of the tenth month in company with my brother-in-law James Brown, who likewi&s;e had the approbation of Go&s;hen monthly-meeting for this purpo&s;e; we vi&s;ited the meetings at Pipe Creek, Bu&s;h Creek and Monaqua&s;y in Maryland, in the fir&s;t of which the Lord was plea&s;ed to favour in opening the &s;tate of friends to the tendering the hearts of many; the other was &s;atisfactory, and the la&s;t &s;eemed to be a renewed vi&s;itation to a raw declining people, &s;everal of whom were tendered through the gracious long-&s;uffering of Infinite Good|ne&s;s; we were next at the preparative meeting at Fairfax in Virginia; then at Goo&s;e Creek, where|in truth owned our &s;ervice to the comfort of the faithful; we then attended the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, al&s;o the monthly-meeting at Fairfax, like|wi&s;e the fir&s;t day meeting there, and one that even|ing in Francis Hague's hou&s;e, who&s;e wife was indi&s;|po&s;ed; &s;everal di&s;orderly walkers being pre&s;ent, the Lord was plea&s;ed to open, and give ability to &s;peak to their &s;tates in a mea&s;ure of his heart tendering love, to the reaching the witne&s;s in &s;ome; after this
<PB N="204" REF="016223_0210_0F9BCF4452022B20">
returning to the widow Janney's, we had a preci|ous opportunity with her and children to our mutu|al &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Our next meeting was at Potts's near the South-mountain, which was open for doctrine, &s;everal of other religious profe&s;&s;ions attending, who appeared loving and well &s;atisfied; then at Crooked-run, near the North-branch of Shanandoa-river, in company with &s;everal other friends from Penn&s;ylvania, &s;ome of us being a committee appointed by our quarter|ly-meeting, the friends living here having reque&s;ted to have a meeting &s;ettled among them; the oppor|tunity was to &s;ome &s;atisfaction, there being &s;ome young people who I hope will grow in the truth, tho' &s;ome of tho&s;e who are elderly appear too &s;u|perficial. From hence we went to Hopewell pre|parative meeting, al&s;o to a &s;mall meeting over the mountain near Je&s;&s;e Pugh's, then we attended a &s;elect meeting at Hopewell, and at the &s;ame place on fir&s;t day, which was large and &s;olid, many there|in being much tendered, to the prai&s;e of the Lord who&s;e mercy endureth for ever; in the evening we had al&s;o a &s;atisfactory meeting at the widow Lup|ton's near Winche&s;ter. Next day we were at Hope|well monthly-meeting, where we found con&s;iderable weakne&s;s, as to the practice of the di&s;cipline, on which account we had &s;ome labour to the comfort of the well-minded; on our return we had meetings at Monallan, Huntington, Warrington, and New|berry in York County Penn&s;ylvania, and a &s;ea&s;ona|ble opportunity with friends in Yorktown, from whence I proceeded home with a thankful mind, having travelled about four hundred miles in this journey.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of the year 1761, having an en|gagement on my mind to vi&s;it Barbadoes and &s;ome of the adjacent I&s;lands, I propo&s;ed the &s;ame to my brethren at home for their weighty con&s;ideration
<PB N="205" REF="016223_0211_0F9BCF4510CB0E98">
before I a&s;ked for their certificate, who after a time expre&s;&s;ed their unity therewith, and gave me a cer|tificate, to which the quarterly-meeting &s;ignified their approbation; at our next yearly-meeting I laid my concern before the mini&s;ters and elders when for any thing that appeared, I had their unity and prayers; I came home intending to proceed before the winter &s;at in, and attended our general meeting at Nottingham in the tenth month, but in a few days after was taken ill with a fever, which with bodily pain and exerci&s;e of mind reduced me to a ve|ry low and weak &s;tate; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 208.</NOTE> but the Lord was plea&s;ed to give me inward &s;trength, influencing my mind with love to all men, and great love to the mem|bers of our religious &s;ociety, the &s;tate whereof I &s;aw in a clear manner, and I &s;o far recovered as to attend our quarterly-meeting at London Grove in the eleventh month, at which I had an opportunity to clear my&s;elf to my humble admiration, and was inwardly comforted: Soon after which (my con|cern for going to Barbadoes continuing,) I went to Philadelphia to inquire for a pa&s;&s;age, when my friends informed me of five ve&s;&s;els, three of which were near ready to &s;ail; but under&s;tanding that all of them were prepared with guns for defence, I felt a &s;ecret excerci&s;e on my mind, &s;o that I could not go to &s;ee any of them; but kept quiet from &s;ixth day evening until &s;econd day morning, when I went to the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, where I had a &s;ingular freedom to let friends know, "That I came to town in order to take my pa&s;&s;age for Barbadoes, but found my&s;elf not at liberty to go in any of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, becau&s;e they carried arms for defence; for as my motive in going, was to publi&s;h <HI>the Glad-tidings of the Go&s;pel, which teach|eth love to all men,</HI> I could not go with tho&s;e who were prepared to de&s;troy men, whom Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord and Ma&s;ter laid down his life to &s;ave and

deliver from that &s;pirit in which wars and fightings &s;tand." I further added, "If I had a concern to vi&s;it in go&s;pel love, tho&s;e now living at Pitt&s;burgh or Fort Duque&s;ne, do you think it would become me to go along with a band of &s;oldiers, as if I wanted the arm of fle&s;h to guard me; would it not be more becoming to go with a few &s;imple unarm|ed men? I now tenderly de&s;ire your &s;ympathy and advice." One hone&s;t friend &s;aid, "Keep to the tender &s;cruple in thy own mind, for it rejoices me to hear it; and &s;everal &s;aid, they believed it would be be&s;t for me to mind my own freedom." I then begged that friends would con&s;ider weightily, whe|ther it was right for any profe&s;&s;ing with us, to be owners or part owners, charterers, freighters, or in&s;urers of &s;uch ve&s;&s;els that a friend could not be free to go pa&s;&s;enger in on a go&s;pel me&s;&s;age: And as I returned to my lodgings, I felt &s;o much peace of mind in thus bearing my te&s;timony, that I thought if all my concern ended therein, it was worth all my trouble, tho' at that time I did not think it would, yet was quite ea&s;y to return home and wait until my way appeared more open; and as my con|cern went off in this manner, I have been &s;ince led to con&s;ider, that I could not have borne that te&s;ti|mony &s;o fully and feelingly, if I had not been thus re&s;trained. <HI>The wi&s;dom and judgments of the Lord are un&s;earchable, and his ways pa&s;t finding out, and happy are they who move at his command and &s;tand &s;tedfa&s;t in his coun&s;el.</HI></P>
<P>Our worthy friends John Stephen&s;on, Robert Proud, Hannah Harris and Elizabeth Wilkin&s;on of Great Britain being in this country on a religious vi&s;it, attended our yearly-meeting in Philadelphia this year, which was large and favoured with hum|bling goodne&s;s, and in a &s;en&s;e of the Divine pre&s;ence that meeting ended very &s;olidly; the &s;ervices of the&s;e friends, I think, have been great among us in

<P>IN the gentle &s;pringing up of Go&s;pel love and fel|low&s;hip I &s;alute you my dear brethren and &s;i&s;ters, and hereby let you know, that it is my fervent de|&s;ire and prayer that you may individually attend to the gift of God in your own hearts, and therein wait for the ari&s;ing of his pure life and power, that therein and thereby only, the affairs of the church may be tran&s;acted to the honour of Truth and your own peace and &s;afety; for to &s;peak in the church to the bu&s;ine&s;s and affairs of truth, by the will, wi&s;dom, and power of man, (however knowing he thinks him&s;elf) will lead into it's own nature, and in the end mini&s;ter &s;trife and contention, and break the unity of the one &s;pirit wherein the peace of the church &s;tands. Wherefore I be&s;eech you beware thereof, and as I know there are among you &s;uch whom the Lord by his &s;pirit and the gentle operati|on of his power, is preparing for his own work; mind your calling in deep humility and holy atten|tion of &s;oul; for in your obedience only, will you be elected and cho&s;en to the work whereunto he

hath called you: So &s;hall you be made &s;kilful watch|men and watchwomen, placed on the walls of Zion to di&s;cover the approach of an enemy, in what&s;o|ever &s;ubtle appearance, and enabled to give warn|ing thereof to others. May each of you &s;tand up|right in your own lots in the regeneration, waiting for the pouring forth of the &s;pirit and anointing of of the Holy Gho&s;t, by the renewing whereof, a true qualification is given in the influence of the love of the Father, rightly to over&s;ee the flock and family of our God, among&s;t whom there are &s;ome plants with you worthy of your care.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have been glad to have &s;at with you, in your monthly-meeting, from the &s;en&s;e of that love which I now renewedly feel to &s;pring and flow towards you, but cannot well leave home, I there|fore at this time, in the pure refre&s;hing &s;tream thereof again &s;alute you, and remain your friend and brother,</P>

<P><HI>In the time of his illne&s;s in the year</HI> 1761, <HI>as men|tioned in page</HI> 205, <HI>he uttered divers weighty expre&s;&s;i|ons, &s;ome of which were committed to writing by a friend who was pre&s;ent, and being well worthy to be further preferred are here in&s;erted,</HI> viz.</P>
<P>In this &s;ickne&s;s he was reduced very low, and &s;ometimes &s;aid it looked unlikely that he &s;hould re|cover, in the forepart thereof he often mentioned his being in great poverty of &s;pirit &s;aying, that be|fore he was taken ill, he felt &s;uch deep di&s;tre&s;s of mind, that he thought he was a cumber to the ground, and &s;carcely worthy to partake of the meane&s;t nece&s;&s;aries of life, that even bread and water &s;eemed too good for him.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="016223_0215_0F9BCF48105409D8">On the fourth of the eleventh month, four friends being pre&s;ent, he &s;pake in a very awful frame of mind nearly as follows,
<Q>Such build on a &s;andy foundation who refu&s;e paying that which is call+ed the Provincial or King's Tax, only becau&s;e &s;ome others &s;cruple paying it, whom they e&s;teem, yet I have now clearly &s;een, as well as heretofore that the te&s;timony of Truth if deeply attended to, will not be found to unite with warlike mea|&s;ures: And that it will in the Lord's time be ex|alted above all oppo&s;ition, and come to po&s;&s;e&s;s even the gates of it's enemies; though it may appear mean and contemptible in the eyes of &s;ome now a days, as the conduct of our primi|tive friends did, in divers re&s;pects in the world's view: And who&s;oever continues to trample upon, or de&s;pi&s;e the tender &s;cruples of their brethren in relation to their clearne&s;s concerning war, will certainly find it a weight too heavy for them to bear.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My te&s;timony on this account &s;o far as I have borne it, yields me &s;atisfaction at this time; and the painful &s;teps I have taken on &s;undry occa&s;i|ons, both in publick and private to di&s;charge my con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God, in giving faith|ful warnings to my brethren and countrymen, both in a civil and religious capacity, afford me comfort in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ea&s;on. I have clearly &s;een, and the pro&s;pect at this time adds Divine &s;trength to my &s;oul, That the God of Truth is determined in due time to exalt the mountain of his Holine&s;s above all the hills of an empty profe&s;&s;ion; and all &s;uch who &s;hall be admitted as clean inhabitants thereon, he wills them to be quite clean handed; and that they &s;hould become &s;ubject to the Lamb's Nature in every re&s;pect, and not &s;hake hands with that

nature which would tear and devour, nor in any &s;hape contribute to the price of blood.</Q></P>
<P>At another time he &s;aid,
<Q>I have been led in the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation allotted me, to behold the &s;ituation of divers particular friends, to whom I feel ardent affection, who &s;eem to have given, or &s;old away for this worlds friend&s;hip, the te&s;ti|mony they &s;hould have born for the Prince of Peace, who is the High Prie&s;t of our profe&s;&s;ion; and for fear of breaking an out&s;ide unity, which will &s;urely come to be broken, that the true uni|ty in the bond of peace may be exalted, have acted contrary to the former &s;ight of their duty, and are thereby become halt, and dim&s;ighted in &s;everal re&s;pects; &s;uch, though they &s;till &s;eem to de&s;ire it, cannot attain to the &s;potle&s;s beauty of Truth, nor approach to the top of the mountain; on who&s;e account I am afraid, that &s;ome of them will never recover their former &s;trength, nor at|tain to that dignity the truth would have placed upon them, if they had been faithful; the &s;itua|tion of whom I have bewailed with anxiety of mind: I have been from my youth up accu&s;tom|ed to &s;orrow, and am a man acquainted with grief, and now remarkably; the lives of my brethren, and of all men appear exceeding pre|cious in my &s;ight. It looks doubtful whether I &s;hall ever &s;ee my friends met in a quarterly-meet|ing again, yet if it be the will of Divine Provi|dence I much de&s;ire it; having heretofore thro' a timerous di&s;po&s;ition, le&s;t I &s;hould offend &s;ome, and for fear of the frowns of elder brethren, concealed &s;ome things I &s;hould have declared: And if I &s;hould now never more have a publick opportunity, I &s;peak thus in your hearing, to let it be known that I am &s;till a well-wi&s;her to all men, and that my integrity to the te&s;timony of
<PB N="211" REF="016223_0217_0F9BCF4990D56708">
Truth, again&s;t all connections with wars and fighting, is now full as &s;trong, or &s;tronger than ever.</Q></P>
<P>On &s;econd day morning the ninth of the eleventh month, he &s;aid to his effect, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>I have been led to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity there is for friends to beware of the cu&s;tom of drinking drams, or &s;trong &s;pi|rits mixed; I have for many years rarely taken any, except on particular occa&s;ions, and then but a very &s;mall quantity: It is my judgment, that the le&s;s any of us accu&s;tom our&s;elves to the u&s;e of tho&s;e &s;pirits, the better it would be for our con&s;titutions in general; I believe it is not con&s;i&s;t|ent with the will of Divine Providence, that the cour&s;e of nature &s;hould be ob&s;tructed and chang|ed, and our animal &s;pirits corrupted through the unnatural warmth of &s;pirituous liquors.</Q></P>
<P><Q>From my pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e and feeling of that re|gular temperance which is truly plea&s;ing in the Eyes of Heaven, I have mourned that the u&s;e of &s;trong drink &s;hould become &s;o prevalent among&s;t us who make &s;o high a profe&s;&s;ion; who&s;e bodies &s;hould be temples of the Holy Gho&s;t, and &s;hould not be defiled, or tainted with any degree of in|temperance: In harve&s;t there is generally plenty of other refre&s;hment, which would keep the bo|dies of men as &s;trong, and as capable to perform hard labour: Witne&s;s the health and &s;trength of our fore-fathers in the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this country, when &s;trong liquors were very little u&s;ed among&s;t them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Alas! how dimne&s;s has overtaken us, when we compare our&s;elves, and our practices with the temperance and moderation of our fore-fathers, and the early &s;ettlers of this Province! How &s;umptuous now are the tables, how rich and co&s;tly the apparel, the diet, and the furniture, of many of our friends even in the country;
<PB N="212" REF="016223_0218_0F9BCF4A504A41F0">
but more e&s;pecially in the city! How is the &s;im|plicity and plainne&s;s of Truth departed from, and pomp and &s;plendid appearances taken their place! And how much co&s;t and time might be &s;pared from needle&s;s things, and applyed to bet|ter u&s;es, to the bettering of our country, and helping to turn away the judgment which hangs over us, in part occa&s;ioned by the&s;e things.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I de&s;ire that my grand children may be brought up in a plain &s;imple way, accu&s;tomed to indu&s;try, and &s;ome u&s;eful bu&s;ine&s;s in the creation; not aiming at great e&s;tates, nor following others in that way; but give them u&s;eful learning, and rather chu&s;e hu&s;bandry, and a plain calling for them in the country, than endeavour to promote them to ways of merchandize; for according to my ob&s;ervation from my youth up, the former is le&s;s dangerous, and le&s;s corrupting: I ob&s;erved when I was in England, that &s;ome of the great|e&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men in a religious &s;en&s;e, were brought up at the plough tail, or in &s;ome labori|ous occupation; where the mind is le&s;s liable to be diverted from an awful &s;en&s;e of the creator, than in an ea&s;y idle education: How many great men there are, whom I could name, who&s;e way of living is mean and homely, in this world's account, &s;o that they have little more than real nece&s;&s;ity requires; and yet they are rich in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>The next day, being a&s;ked how he was, he &s;aid nearly as follows,
<Q>I have &s;lept &s;weetly, and &s;eem much refre&s;hed, and tho' I feel my&s;elf very weak in body, I am full of Divine con&s;olation, having never before had &s;uch pro&s;pects of Hea|venly things: It &s;eems even as though my &s;oul was united in chorus with glorifyed Saints and Angels both &s;leeping and waking. I now believe I &s;hall recover, and that this &s;ickne&s;s did not
<PB N="213" REF="016223_0219_0F9BCF4B19860EC0">
happen to me altogether on my own account; my way to recover is to be indu&s;trious and dili|gent in what I believe is required of me; I have many me&s;&s;ages to deliver, both in publick, and privately to divers friends, whom I have &s;een to have mi&s;&s;ed their way, and have in a great mea|&s;ure deprived them&s;elves of the beauty where|with an humble abiding in the truth would have dignifyed them; and &s;ome of my elder brethren, for whom I feel an uncommon nearne&s;s of affec|tion, their lives never appeared to be more near to me, and I dare not conceal coun&s;el from them, whether they will hear or forbear: Yea, I thought la&s;t night, I had a clear pro&s;pect of the &s;ituati|ons of many within the verge of our quarterly-meeting; it &s;eemed as though the inward &s;tates of particulars were opened to me in full view; the pure Life in the brightne&s;s of Religion never appeared to be more precious; an uncommon earne&s;tne&s;s attends my mind, for the recovery of the rebellious, hypocritical, and back&s;liding pro|fe&s;&s;ors of all ranks among&s;t us: And if I get to our quarterly-meeting (which I believe I &s;hall) and can have time allowed me when there, I have tidings, important tidings, as from a dying man, to many particulars: I have &s;een the my&s;te|ry of the three days, or the Prophets laying three days and three nights in the belly of the fi&s;h: A wicked and adulterous generation are now as well as formerly, &s;eeking for a &s;ign to things &s;poken clo&s;ely, but no &s;ign &s;hall be given them, &s;ave the &s;ign of the Prophet Jonah: Our Savi|our's &s;ufferings for mankind, and afterwards de|&s;cending into the bowels of the earth prefigured that this followers mu&s;t, after his pattern, de|&s;cend into Spiritual Bapti&s;m; that they may ri&s;e again, freed from the dregs of nature, and from the corruptions of the creaturely pa&s;&s;ions, before
<PB N="214" REF="016223_0220_0F9BCF4D2D358838">
they can be qualified to &s;ee, and &s;uitably to ad|mini&s;ter to the &s;tates of others. I have likewi&s;e &s;een the my&s;tery of Ezekiel's &s;ufferings, and bearing the &s;ins of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael for the &s;pace of 390 days, which being accompli&s;hed, he was commanded to turn on the other &s;ide, and to bear the &s;ins of Judah forty days, for the cor|ruptions of that princely tribe, who &s;hould have been as way-marks to others. My &s;tate has been for &s;everal years pa&s;t, my deep Bapti&s;ms, and painful &s;ittings in our meetings, like bearing the rod of the wicked, in which di&s;pen&s;ation I have been &s;ometimes ready to conclude with Elijah, that the altars were thrown down, and the Lord's Prophets &s;lain, and I, a mean worthle&s;s &s;ervant left alone, and that my life was &s;ought al&s;o; I have now &s;een the u&s;e of tho&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations to me, with the u&s;e of my late &s;ickne&s;s, whereby I am reduced to great weakne&s;s of body; that I might be as a &s;ign to this generation, and as with the mouth of a dying man, utter tidings without fear of giving offence; tidings which I have heretofore concealed, through a timerous di&s;po&s;ition. I have &s;een at this &s;ea&s;on that the Lord hath pre&s;erved a living number in I&s;rael, who have not bowed the knee to Baal, or the god of this world, I have al&s;o &s;een the conditions of many who have wor&s;hipped &s;trange gods; and the corruption even of &s;ome who have a&s;&s;umed the &s;tation of mini&s;ters in our &s;ociety, how they are deceived &s;o far as to believe a lye; have &s;een lying vi&s;ions, and have cau&s;ed the weak to &s;tum|ble; they have been &s;peaking peace to the people as in the Lord's Name, when it was only a fla&s;h, or divination of their own brain, which has tend|ed to corruption and putrefaction in the church|es: And I have &s;een how that many little ones have laid groaning as under the burden and op|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="215" REF="016223_0221_0F9BCF4D534A1470">
of the&s;e things, who&s;e day of redemp|tion draweth near, when they &s;hall be made by the Almighty, as bright &s;tars in the firmament of his power; and tho&s;e who are corrupt, and &s;ettled on their lees, &s;hall be puni&s;hed. In this di&s;pen&s;ation I have abundantly witne&s;&s;ed the in|comes of that Peace and Love which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding; neither my tongue nor capacity are able to &s;et forth the bowels of compa&s;&s;ion which I livingly feel to flow towards the whole bulk of mankind; and e&s;pecially to my brethren in profe&s;&s;ion: Yea, it &s;eems as though no affliction would be too great to endure for their &s;akes, if it might be a means to have &s;ome of them (who&s;e &s;itutation I have now been led to behold as particulars) re&s;tored to their former greenne&s;s and &s;piritual health, from whence they have fallen, and dimne&s;s has overtaken them. And tho' my outward man &s;eems almo&s;t wa&s;ted, my &s;pirit is &s;trong in the Lord, and in the inexpre&s;|&s;ible &s;trength of affection, I have found my &s;pirit led from place to place over the country, to vi&s;it the &s;ouls in pri&s;on: Yea, I have beheld the dawn|ing of that precious morning, wherein corrup|tion &s;hall be &s;wept away from the church, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Truth begin to flouri&s;h great|ly: The day &s;eems to me to be at hand; and what if I &s;ay, I have a degree of faith that &s;ome of the children now born may live to &s;ee it: Through innocent boldne&s;s, my face now &s;eems to be as bra&s;s, and in the openings of the vi&s;ion of life, I think I could utter Go&s;pel Truths, and di&s;cover the my&s;tery of iniquity which I have &s;een, without fearing any mortal man: I may be rai&s;ed to live a while longer, though to die now, would be a welcome relea&s;e to me: Yea, I could not de&s;ire to live, but for the longings of &s;oul, and pantings of heart which I feel towards the
<PB N="216" REF="016223_0222_0F9BCF4E11D5BC20">
precious &s;eed in many whom I have now been led in &s;pirit to vi&s;it. I have beheld their &s;ituation to be as lumps, taken or cut-out from the bowels of their mother the earth, tho' much hidden from the view of mortals; and are tempering and fa&s;hioning by the Divine Power, in different &s;hapes, for divers u&s;es; and I have &s;een that the Potter's Power is &s;ufficient to pick out, and take away every gravel and little pebble of nature; many I have beheld in this &s;ituation, &s;et by (as it were) out of &s;ight to dry, until all the damp|ne&s;s and natural moi&s;ture is removed from them: Not being yet fitted to undergo the operation of burning; but when properly prepared, and thoroughly dried, many will be brought to the fire, burned, and glazed, &s;o that they may retain the liquor or wine of the kingdom with a &s;weet ta&s;te, without any degree of taint, or nau&s;eous &s;mell.</Q></P>
<P>On the twelfth of the eleventh month early in the morning, he &s;pake to this purpo&s;e;
<Q>I believe I mu&s;t endeavour to go to our quarterly-meeting, (which began the fourteenth) although as to bo|dily &s;trength I am very weak: There my mind is remarkably, &s;leeping and waking; there I hope to be relieved of &s;ome things which &s;eem to re|main like a fire in my bones; I dare not forbear, I know it is the way for me to recover my &s;trength outwardly, and to be ea&s;ed of that which is a heavy burden inwardly; I &s;ee I mu&s;t go, and believe I &s;hall recruit, and gain &s;trength every day,</Q>
(which was the ca&s;e accordingly.) He fur|ther &s;aid,
<Q>My mind has for &s;everal days been at|tended with an uncommon &s;weetne&s;s, the like I never knew for &s;o long together, with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;oul-melting pro&s;pects: I have freedom to relate what I had a &s;ight of this morning before day, as I lay in a &s;weet &s;lumber,</Q>
(which was nearly in the&s;e
<PB N="217" REF="016223_0223_0F9BCF4ED7A3F8B0">
words,) <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>I thought I &s;aw Noah's Ark floating on the deluge, or flood, with Noah and his Fa|mily in it, and looking earne&s;tly at it, I beheld the window of the Ark, and &s;aw Noah put out the dove; and I beheld her flying to and fro, for &s;ome time; but finding no re&s;t for the &s;oal of her foot, I thought &s;he returned, and I &s;aw Noah's hand put forth to take her in again. Af|ter &s;ome time I thought I beheld her put forth a &s;econd time, and a raven with her, the dove fled as before for &s;ome time, and then I &s;aw her return with a green olive leaf in her mouth, as a welcome token of the flood's being abated; I thought I &s;aw al&s;o the raven fly, cawking, to and fro, but he did not return; and it came into my mind, this is a ravenous bird, and &s;eeks only for prey to &s;atisfy his own &s;tomach, otherwi&s;e he might have returned to the Ark with good tidings, or &s;ome plea&s;ant token, as well as the dove: Again, after a &s;hort &s;pace, I thought I beheld the mountain tops, and &s;ome of the tree tops, beginning to appear above the waters, and that I could perceive the flood abate very fa&s;t; and as the waters fell away I &s;aw the trees began to bud and a gradual greenne&s;s of new leaves came upon them, and I heard the voice of the turtle, and &s;aw many &s;ymptoms of a plea&s;ant and happy &s;ea&s;on approaching, more than I can now relate; and the pro&s;pect thereof ravi&s;hed my &s;oul; I beheld the trees blo&s;&s;oming, the fragrant valleys adorned with gra&s;s, herbs, and pretty flowers, and the plea&s;ant &s;treams gu&s;hing down towards the ocean; indeed, all nature appeared to have a new dre&s;s; the birds were hopping on the boughs of the trees, and chirping; each in their own notes, warbled forth the prai&s;e of their creator. And whil&s;t I beheld the&s;e things, a &s;aying of the Prophet was brought fre&s;h in my
<PB N="218" REF="016223_0224_0F9BCF4F8F079090">
memory, and applicable as I thought to the view before me, viz. <HI>The mountains and the hills &s;hall break forth before you into &s;inging, and all the trees of the field &s;hall clap their hands; in&s;tead of the thorn &s;hall come up the fir tree, and in&s;tead of the brier &s;hall come up the myrtle tree, and it &s;hall be to the Lord for a name, for an everla&s;ting &s;ign that &s;hall not be cut off,</HI></Q>
&s;ee I&s;aiah, lv. 12-13.</P>
<P><Q>When I awoke, the pro&s;pect remained clear in my mind, and had a &s;weet reli&s;h, which now con|tinues with me; and the application of the Vi&s;ion &s;eems to me in this manner: The flood which appeared to cover the face of the earth, is the corruption and darkne&s;s which is &s;o prevalent over the hearts of mankind; the Ark repre&s;ents a place of &s;afe (tho' &s;olitary) refuge, wherein the Almighty pre&s;erves his humble attentive people, who, like Noah, are aiming at perfection in their generation. The dove &s;ets forth the innocent, harmle&s;s, and loving di&s;po&s;ition, which attends the followers of the lamb who are always willing to bring good tidings, when &s;uch are to be had: The raven repre&s;ents a contrary di&s;po&s;ition which reigns in the hearts of the children of di&s;obedi|ence, who chiefly aim at gratifying their own &s;en&s;ual appetites; the waters gradually abating, the trees appearing, and afterwards budding, the voice of the turtle, and the plea&s;ant notes of the birds, all &s;eem clear to me, to pre&s;age the approach of that glorious morning, wherein cur|ruption and iniquity &s;hall begin to abate, and be &s;wept away; and then every thing &s;hall appear to have a new dre&s;s: I am fully confirmed in the belief, that that &s;ea&s;on will approach, which was foretold by the prophet, wherein the glory of the Lord &s;hall cover the earth, as the waters cover the &s;ea; and in a &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things my &s;oul is overcome. I feel the loving kindne&s;s of the
<PB N="219" REF="016223_0225_0F9BCF505692B3A8">
Lord Almighty, yet waiting for the return of back&s;liders with un&s;peakable mercy; and my &s;oul in a &s;en&s;e of it, &s;eems bound &s;tronger than ever, in the bonds of a go&s;pel travail; which travail I hope will encrea&s;e, and &s;pread among&s;t the faithful, for the enlargement of the church; that the nations may flock unto Sion; which &s;hall become an eternal excellency, even the joy of the whole earth.</Q></P>
<P>Again he expre&s;&s;ed his having a pro&s;pect of the morning; and &s;aid,
<Q>The day &s;tar is ri&s;en, which pre&s;ages the approach of the morning; I have &s;een it in its lu&s;tre, and have a lively &s;en&s;e of that &s;aying being again fulfilled in the New-Cre|ation, (&s;ee <HI>Job,</HI> xxxviii. 7.) <HI>The morning &s;tars &s;ang together, and the &s;ons of God &s;houted for joy.</HI> I have heard their &s;ound intelligibly, and my heart is comforted therein. The pot&s;herds of the earth may cla&s;h together for a &s;ea&s;on; but the Lord in due time will bring about the reforma|tion: The predictions of Archbi&s;hop U&s;her, (mentioned in the preface to Sewell's Hi&s;tory) have come fre&s;h in my memory, and nearly cor|re&s;pond with the &s;en&s;e I have, that a &s;harp and trying di&s;pen&s;ation is to come upon the profe&s;|&s;ors of chri&s;tianity; wherein the hone&s;t and up|right hearted &s;hall be hid as under the hollow of the Lord's hand; when rents, divi&s;ions and com|motions &s;hall encrea&s;e among&s;t the earthly-mind|ed, and one branch of a family be at &s;trife with another, like the daughter-in-law again&s;t the mother-in-law, &amp;c. and happy will it be for tho&s;e who endeavour to &s;tand ready for the approach of &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ation.</Q></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the &s;pring of the year 1764, I acquainted my friends that I had a de&s;ire to attend the quar|terly-meeting at Salem in New-Jer&s;ey, wherewith having their concurrence, on the &s;eventeenth of the fifth month I left home and went to Wilmington, and next day in company with &s;everal friends from thence by water to our friend Jo&s;hua Thomp&s;on's at the mouth of Salem Creek; at the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders we were comfortted together through the goodne&s;s of the Lord; on fir&s;t day there was a large gathering of a mixed multitude, and quiet, the Divine power being felt and Go&s;pel Truths preached, by the influence of the love whereof many hearts were tendered; tho' I thought the beauty and &s;olemnity of the meeting was a little marred by an appearance that was continued too long; <HI>to begin in the life and conclude in the power and life, is becoming a mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>On &s;econd day morning the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders was again held, it was a precious in&s;truc|tive &s;ea&s;on in the love of Chri&s;t our holy head, by which the humble were united; afterwards we had a large meeting for public wor&s;hip, wherein the te&s;timony of Truth flowed freely; the call to the
<PB N="221" REF="016223_0227_0F9BCF51D1D287D0">
mini&s;try and qualification nece&s;&s;ary to preach the Go&s;pel being clearly &s;et forth; in humble admira|tion I could renewedly acknowledge, <HI>Thou art, Oh Lord! Strength in our weakne&s;s, mouth and wi&s;dom, yea all things to thy humble depending &s;ervants who&s;e tru&s;t is on thee, waiting for thy putting forth in the way, and gently going before them, ble&s;&s;ed be thy holy name for ever.</HI> In tran&s;acting the affairs or the di&s;cipline a &s;pirit of brotherly love prevailed; the youth's-meeting at Pile&s;grove was al&s;o large and edifying, the great Shepherd of I&s;rael being plea&s;ed to &s;tretch forth the crook of his Love, for gather|ing of the &s;traying youth from pur&s;uing after lying vanities and worldly plea&s;ures; mini&s;tring reproof to hypocrites and formal profe&s;&s;ors, yet comforting his children and humble dependant followers, to the prai&s;e of his own eternal name; the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders &s;at again by adjournment, when we had an uniting parting &s;ea&s;on; I returned to my friend Jo&s;hua Thomp&s;on's, next day to a meeting at Wilmington, and in the evening home, being thankful that I had been enabled to perform this &s;mall journey.</P>
<P>After which having a &s;trong de&s;ire to attend the general-meetings at Go&s;hen and Uwchlan, on the eighth of the &s;ixth month my dear wife and I left home, tho' I was very unwell with a cold taken in my return from Salem, and a fever attending me eve|ry day; we attended Uwchlan meeting on fir&s;t day, al&s;o one in the evening at the hou&s;e of our brother Daniel Brown, which was dull and exerci&s;ing, from a &s;en&s;e of the prevalence of a &s;pirit which leads many into forgetfulne&s;s of God, after the vanities, love and plea&s;ures of this peri&s;hing world. Next day the general meeting at Go&s;hen was very large, and much di&s;turbed by the going out and coming in of many, but thro' Divine goodne&s;s it came to a better &s;ettlement before it concluded, when &s;olid

friends in a degree of the renewing of the Lord's comforting love, were refre&s;hed in him and one ano|ther; a vi&s;itation being continued to the youth, the prai&s;e whereof belongs to the great Author of all good!</P>
<P>The general-meeting at Uwchlan on the day fol|lowing was al&s;o large, and mea&s;urably attended with the ownings of truth, under the influence of which, admonition and coun&s;el flowed freely to the youth, the Divine witne&s;s in &s;everal of whom was reached, and the name of the Lord prai&s;ed, who is for ever worthy!</P>
<P>In the&s;e large meetings, as on all other &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions, it is nece&s;&s;ary in order for a proper qualifi|cation to mini&s;ter to the people, humbly to wait to know the inward life, and baptizing virtue of the &s;pirit and power of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our all in all, with|out who&s;e help we can never do his work to his prai&s;e, but in&s;tead of gathering the flock, we &s;hall mini&s;ter to their &s;cattering from the true place of feeding. After being at the preparative meeting at Ea&s;t-Caln and a meeting at Uwchlan, we returned home thankful to the Lord, who had mercifully &s;upported us in this &s;mall journey, both of us being weakly and indi&s;po&s;ed in health.</P>
<P>In the ninth month 1767, I attended our yearly-meeting in Philadelphia, which held a week, all the &s;ittings whereof both for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, were through the over&s;hadowing of Divine favour, in&s;tructive to the humble waiters; and the te&s;timo|ny of Truth, particularly again&s;t the unju&s;t and unrighteous practice of &s;lave-keeping, greatly pre|vailed; and friends were fully cautioned again&s;t be|queathing by will, as &s;laves to their po&s;terity, the poor Negroes, their fellow-creatures, it being an unlawful act in the &s;ight of the great and righteous parent of all mankind. This meeting concluded with a degree of awe and reverence, under the &s;weeten|ing
<PB N="223" REF="016223_0229_0F9BCF534EFDEBD0">
influence of the Father's Love: I returned home to our general-meeting at Nottingham, which was held on the fourth and fifth days of the tenth month.</P>
<P>After which having a &s;trong de&s;ire to attend the general-meeting at Caecil in Maryland, I &s;at out in company with &s;everal other friends, and reached the fir&s;t &s;itting of the meeting, which was &s;mall and dull; the public meeting next day was very large and attended with &s;ome &s;atisfaction, tho&s;e of other &s;ocieties who were there were mo&s;tly pretty quiet; at the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders the want of &s;olid elders being evident, the con&s;idera|tion thereof was propo&s;ed to the quarterly-meeting, which was held in the afternoon of the &s;ame day, when it was recommended to the monthly-meetings to ob&s;erve the directions of the yearly-meeting, to chu&s;e well qualified &s;olid friends for that weighty &s;tation.</P>
<P>The meeting for public wor&s;hip was again large, being attended by many of other &s;ocieties, and my brother W^m^. Brown was largely opened in doctrine to the edification of the auditory; after which I had a &s;hort te&s;timony tending to clo&s;e the forego|ing: In the meeting for di&s;cipline I had occa&s;ion to lament that there were too few who feelingly under&s;tood the weight of &s;uch meetings, or were clean handed to move therein, either to their own profit or the help of their brethren; yet there are a few who &s;eem to be under a preparation for the work, and I hope will grow in their gifts. On third day morning bu&s;ine&s;s began again, and ended full as well as I expected. I thought the Lord was mercifully plea&s;ed to open con&s;iderable in&s;truction to &s;uch among them, who had ears to hear and hearts di&s;po&s;ed to receive it. The meeting for wor|&s;hip held that afternoon, was not &s;o large as on the other two days, the &s;ervice thereof lay weightily

on me, and I had a full opportunity to relieve my mind towards the people, in opening to them the nature and ground of &s;piritual wor&s;hip and true prayer, al&s;o the true call and qualification for go&s;pel mini&s;try, declaring what it was to <HI>live of the Go&s;pel,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to a forced maintenance; Truth favoured and the people were &s;olid, &s;everal being much reached; the meeting ending to &s;ati&s;|faction, with a &s;en&s;e of humble thank&s;giving in many hearts to the Lord, who&s;e mercies through Chri&s;t Je&s;us are to his people yea and amen for ever.</P>
<P><HI>His wife being under many years affliction with a Cancer on her head, which was now &s;o greatly in|crea&s;ed as to require his daily affectionate attendance, confined him mo&s;tly at home until after her decea&s;e, which was in the &s;eventh month</HI> 1770; <HI>&s;he was a &s;teady examplary friend: Concerning whom the month|ly-meeting of Nottingham give the following te&s;timony.</HI></P>

<P>Our friend Margaret Churchman was born (of believing parents William and Either Brown, who lived at Chiche&s;ter in the county of Che&s;ter in Penn&s;ylvania,) the thirteenth of the fir&s;t month 1706-7, her father removing with his family into Maryland near Su&s;quehanna, died before &s;he was ten years old. In the twenty-third year of her age, &s;he entered into a marriage &s;tate with John Churchman of Nottingham, and being religiou&s;|ly inclined from her childhood, became a diligent &s;eeker after that bread which nouri&s;hes the in|ward man, and thereby grew in religion, and about the thirty-fourth year of her age, it plea&s;ed the Lord to put her forth in the mini&s;try, in which &s;he was frequently exerci&s;ed to the comfort and edification of the churches where &s;he vi&s;ited, in this and the Southern Provinces, being delivered in a degree of life, and go&s;pel &s;weetne&s;s in per|tinent

<P>In the latter part of her life &s;he was for many years afflicted with a cancer on her head, which &s;he bore with remarkable patience, re&s;ignation and innocent chearfulne&s;s, attending meetings to the admiration of many who knew her di&s;|ea&s;e, which notwith&s;tanding various applications &s;o increa&s;ed that &s;he became too weak to attend meetings &s;ometime before her decea&s;e, yet &s;he retained her love to truth and friends to the la&s;t, and in the &s;ixty-fourth year of her age, be|ing a mini&s;ter about thirty years, &s;he departed this life, on the twenty-eighth of the &s;eventh month 1770, and was buried on the thirtieth in friends burying ground at Ea&s;t-Nottingham, at|tended by many friends and neighbours, at which time we had a &s;olid &s;atisfactory meeting.</P>

<P>Having an inclination to attend Che&s;ter quarterly-meeting, al&s;o &s;ome meetings within the verge there|of; with the concurrence of friends I &s;at out on the fir&s;t of the &s;econd month 1771, attended New-Garden monthly-meeting next day, in which the love of our merciful Father was mea&s;urably felt, to the comfort of the humble in heart, and on fir&s;t

day at Birmingham, on the next had a meeting in the hou&s;e of Richard Downing at Milltown, with people of various &s;orts; the Lord was plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t with wi&s;dom and ability, in mea&s;ure, to di|vide his word in reproof, coun&s;el, admonition and caution, to the prai&s;e of his own name; on third day at Pikeland was a pretty full meeting tho' a very cold day, Truth was felt to be near us; a pro|fitable opportunity was had al&s;o in the family of the widow Meredith, the being weakly did not get out to their meeting; next day had a cold ride to Nant|mell, where was a large full meeting and I believe beneficial to many pre&s;ent, by the tendering good|ne&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ed Shepherd of &s;piritual I&s;rael, the crook of who&s;e heavenly love is &s;till &s;tretched forth to his &s;heep, who are not yet acquainted with the true fold of re&s;t and &s;afe feeding place; his own works prai&s;e him: Uwchlan monthly-meeting on the day following was a laborious &s;ea&s;on, yet through Divine favour made comfortable to the weary tra|vellers, who had to rejoice together in a participa|tion of the con&s;olation of I&s;rael, and therein to wor&s;hip his name who is worthy for ever. Go&s;hen monthly-meeting was al&s;o laborious; when former experience is fed upon, or the love or honour of the world and fle&s;hly ea&s;e takes place, a &s;pirit grows up in the church, which cannot judge for God and his Truth; for the judgment is his, in who&s;e fear his children are made to rejoice, when his pre&s;ence is known, and his humbling goodne&s;s manife&s;ted to his people. On fir&s;t day I was at Middletown meeting, in which there &s;eemed to be a tender vi&s;itation and call to the youth, to acquaint them|&s;elves with the God of their Fathers, his love being mea&s;urably witne&s;&s;ed among us. The quarterly-meeting for Che&s;ter held at Concord, was &s;olid and edifying, through the extending of the Heavenly father's love to the children of his family; from
<PB N="227" REF="016223_0233_0F9BCF564FD661E0">
thence I went to Wilmington, vi&s;ited &s;ome of my aquaintance, and had a comfortable &s;itting in the family of David Ferri&s;s, his &s;on Benjamin being ill in a con&s;umption: I al&s;o attended the monthly-meeting, which tho' a &s;earching time, was I be|lieve to the comfort and edification of many, the uniting love of truth being experienced, re&s;ted on friends in the time of the bu&s;ine&s;s; after which I went to the monthly-meetings at Center and Brad|ford, and from thence to our quarterly-meeting at London-Grove; then returned home, having great peace in performing this journey, and being favoured with ability, felt a degree of reverent thankfulne&s;s to the Lord, who is all things to his &s;ervants, who truly abide in nothingne&s;s of &s;elf, he is therefore worthy of all obedience and honour for ever.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fir&s;t of the third month, I left my habitation in order to attend our general &s;pring-meeting at Philadelphia, in my way called at Wil|mington, and was at the burial of Benjamin Ferri&s;s before mentioned: Our &s;pring-meeting was to me very comfortable in a &s;en&s;e of the living pre&s;ence of the Holy Head of the church, in which his true children were edified, and &s;trengthened and mutu|ally comforted one in another; ble&s;&s;ed be his name for ever!</P>
<P>At this meeting the brethren both mini&s;ters and elders, apprehend it their duty in the love of Chri&s;t, to appoint &s;uch who are willing to give up their names to attend the &s;everal large or general meet|tings, which come in cour&s;e in the en&s;uing &s;ummer before our yearly-meeting, to which they are ex|pected to give &s;ome account of the meetings &s;o at|tended by them, and feeling a &s;mall draught in my mind to be at that at Duck Creek, I gave in my name to attend it.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="016223_0234_0F9BCF58763BCA00">On my return from Philadelphia I &s;at with friends at their week day meeting in Wilmington, which through the continued goodne&s;s of the Lord, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure a profitable &s;ea&s;on, I hope to ma|ny: Here I felt a &s;trong de&s;ire to &s;ee the friends to|gether, who are owners of the gri&s;t-mills lately built at and near Brandiwyne, and upon notice thereof, they met the &s;ame afternoon at the hou&s;e of Daniel Byrnes, when I had an opportunity to di&s;charge my mind in an affectionate manner, of what had impre&s;&s;ed it towards them, which they appeared to receive in a degree of the &s;ame love, and as I believe it came from the author of all good, who is alone worthy of prai&s;e, a ble&s;&s;ing may attend that opportunity if rightly remembered.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;ixth of the fourth month being accompanied by a friend and neighbour, I went to Duck Creek, and was at the monthly-meeting there the next day, which was heavy, occa&s;ioned by the prevalence of a formal, lukewarm worldly &s;pirit over many of the profe&s;&s;ors belonging thereto, but through the long &s;uffering and continued mercy of God, there &s;eemed to be a renewed awakening vi|&s;itation to &s;ome. The meeting on fir&s;t day was ve|ry large, the Lord being mercifully plea&s;ed to open the &s;tates and conditions of many, in a particular in&s;trumental manner, and in a mea&s;ure of his holy heart tendering power, which reached the witne&s;s, divers were humbled, and the meeting ended with thank&s;giving, prayer and prai&s;es to the Lord who is worthy for ever.</P>
<P>On &s;econd day the meeting was not &s;o large, oc|ca&s;ioned by a fair being near, neverthele&s;s it was a &s;ea&s;on in which the doctrine and my&s;teries of the kingdom of Chri&s;t were largely &s;et forth to the people, by the influence of the &s;pirit, and in the love and wi&s;dom of the holy high Prie&s;t, who is all in all to his people.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="016223_0235_0F9BCF58945FB6A8">We had al&s;o three &s;elect opportunities with the mini&s;ters and elders, among whom there was great apparent weakne&s;s, the rea&s;ons whereof were plain|ly made known to them, from the &s;en&s;e given in the love and fear of him, who will not own and unite with &s;uch as are defiled, which plainne&s;s we had a hope would be profitable.</P>
<P>Next day &s;everal of us were at George's Creek, which meeting is much declined; where the love of the world and its alluring vanities prevail on the profe&s;&s;ors of truth, their affections are drawn from God, they grow &s;lack in attending meetings, and are a bad example one to another; it was a hard meeting, but through the love of Chri&s;t, a mea&s;ure of go&s;pel anointing enabled to open to them their &s;tates in great love and plainne&s;s, which &s;eemed to affect &s;ome particulars, may it be remembred with reverence before him who is the author of all good, and prai&s;e worthy for ever!</P>
<P>Soon after my return home, feeling my mind engaged to attend the quarterly-meeting in Bucks County, with a few other meetings in Philadelphia quarter, I &s;et out on the twenty-&s;ixth of the fifth month, accompanied by Samuel England, and on the third day of the week following was at the Bank meeting in Philadelphia, which was comfort|able; on fifth day at the quarterly-meeting at Buck|ingham, and next day at the general youth's meet|ing, which was large and divinely favoured, then vi&s;iting &s;everal indi&s;po&s;ed friends, on fir&s;t day I attended Plum&s;tead meeting, and in that week the &s;everal monthly-meetings of Buckingham, Wright&s;|town, the Falls and Middletown, al&s;o a public meet|ing at Makefield; was on fir&s;t day at Bri&s;tol, from whence I went with my friend James Thornton to their afternoon meeting at Byberry, had an ap|pointed one at the &s;ame place next day; and in that week vi&s;ited the &s;everal neigbouring meetings, one
<PB N="230" REF="016223_0236_0F9BCF595D2B4CE8">
of which was a general youth's meeting at Hor&s;|ham, large and in&s;tructive, wherein the love of our Heavenly Father was felt by his truly depending children; then taking meetings at Gwynedd, Pro|vidence, Richland, Oley, Exeter, Maiden Creek, Reading, and on fir&s;t day at the Fore&s;t, I from thence rode to Uwchlan, and on &s;econd day had a meeting at Milltown in the hou&s;e of Robert Valen|tine, then proceeded home, having rode about 370 miles in this journey, in which I was favoured with my health, and held travelling beyond my expecta|tion. At the gentle drawings of Truth I left my habitation, having little pro&s;pect of much before me, but was pre&s;erved in a quiet re&s;ignation to the Divine will to do what&s;oever &s;hould appear my duty, be&s;eeching the Lord to enable me to watch again&s;t every appearance of &s;elf in the great and pure work of declaring the go&s;pel to the people, and have great cau&s;e to be humbly thankful, that the Lord was plea&s;ed to own my &s;ervice beyond expectation, to the exaltation of his own truth; ble&s;&s;ed be his name for ever!</P>
<P>In the tenth month following I went to the yearly-meeting at Third-haven in Maryland, the meetings for wor&s;hip held three days, and each of them were very large, and many Go&s;pel Truths were delivered in the love and power thereof, by which the wit|ne&s;s of God was reached in the hearts of many of the people, and friends comforted and made thank|ful to the Lord, that he was plea&s;ed to own us with the over&s;hadowing of his heavenly love; on fourth day morning the affairs of the di&s;cipline were fini&s;h|ed, when we had a parting meeting, which through Divine favour was a precious time to many. I had never been at the yearly-meeting when held at this place before, and now witne&s;&s;ed my heart enlarged in the love of the Go&s;pel to declare the &s;ame among the multitude of people who profe&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;tian

name, and to remind them of their conduct and dre&s;s, how different it was from that of tho&s;e who formerly &s;uffered martyrdom for their religion as now profe&s;&s;ed by the members of the Church of England &s;o called, who own the reformers as their predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Feeling a draught of love in my mind towards &s;ome meetings in New-Jer&s;ey, particulartly at Egg-harbour, having the concurrence of my friends at home, I &s;et out on &s;econd day the fir&s;t of the &s;ixth month 1772, and taking in my way a meeting at Haddonfield, and another at the hou&s;e of my friend Thomas Evans, which through the pre&s;ence and power of the &s;earcher of hearts was made profita|ble to &s;ome there pre&s;ent, reached Little Egg-harbour on &s;eventh day, and the next attended the yearly-meeting, in which the love of the go&s;pel was felt to flow towards a loo&s;e, raw, uncivilized people, who appeared to attend there more out of curio&s;ity, than a reverent thoughtfulne&s;s of wor&s;hiping almighty God; in the afternoon of the &s;ame day the conti|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ce of Divine favour was remarkably evident towards the inhabitants, for which the Lord made the hearts of his &s;en&s;ible children thankful to him|&s;elf who is the author of all good; the meeting on &s;econd day was al&s;o very large, in which the true children of the family were comforted in Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord and holy head of the church, by the anointing virtue of who&s;e precious name and power, they were made to rejoice in the company one of another; here parting with many valuable beloved friends, I went over the bay, to the upper meeting on Great Egg-harbour &s;hore, which was large con&s;i|dering the notice, here I was comforted in knowing for who&s;e name &s;ake I was made willing to leave my company, and turn that way, the Lord being plea&s;ed to own my &s;ervice by the in&s;piration of a degree of his heavenly wi&s;dom and love, to &s;peak

to the &s;tates of tho&s;e that were pre&s;ent, ble&s;&s;ed be his name who is worthy for ever. I went home with my friend Jo&s;eph Mapes, next day attended the lower meeting, which through Divine favour was a precious &s;ea&s;on, then pa&s;&s;ed over to the Cape, and next morning was at a meeting at the upper hou&s;e, where many not of our &s;ociety attended, to whom the doctrine of the Go&s;pel flowed in de&s;cribing the nature of pure and undefiled religion, and wherein it con&s;i&s;ted; the people were &s;till and quiet. In the afternoon of the &s;ame day I had a meeting at the lower hou&s;e, which is called eight miles down the Cape, this was an heart tendering time, for which friends were made truly thankful; I thought it &s;eemed like to be my la&s;t vi&s;it to the&s;e parts. From thence I went to Cohan&s;y, 45 miles, to Mark Reeve's where I re&s;ted the next day, being very weary and almo&s;t overcome with hard traveling; on fir&s;t day I was at Greenwich meeting, and in the afternoon at Alloways Creek, which was very large, many of other &s;ocieties attending, the doc|trine of Truth flowed to them in a mea&s;ure of the love thereof; next day the meeting at Salem was held in the Court-hou&s;e, the meeting-hou&s;e being taken down, and a new one building; on third day I was at the upper meeting near Alloways Creek, which through Divine Goodne&s;s was an in&s;tructive time to &s;ome &s;eekers; the pa&s;&s;age treated upon was our Lord's de&s;cription of the phari&s;ee and pub|lican who went up to the temple to pray, the great difference in the form of their addre&s;&s;es was opened in a clear manner, by the &s;pirit of him who gave forth that parable, to my humble admiration, which was cau&s;e of reverent thankfulne&s;s, they who were &s;en&s;ible being encouraged, and the conceited form|ali&s;ts rebuked.</P>
<P>From hence I went to John Davis's, had a com|fortable opportunity with &s;ome indi&s;po&s;ed friends in

After &s;taying two days, and on each at|tending meetings in the city, I took Wilmington meeting in my way home, having travelled about three hundred and fifty miles, attended about twen|ty meetings, be&s;ides having &s;everal comfortable op|portunities in families.</P>
<P>Being under an appointment with other friends of our quarterly-meeting, to vi&s;it friends of the monthly-meetings of Warrington and Fairfax, I &s;et out on the &s;eventh of the tenth month, and taking a meeting with friends in Yorktown, we were at Warrington on fir&s;t day, then vi&s;ited the &s;everal meetings of Newberry, Huntington, and Monallen, in which Truth owned our &s;ervice in a good de|gree; our labour of love appearing to be kindly received, I hope may be u&s;eful; on the fir&s;t day following five of us were at Pipe Creek meeting, then at Bu&s;h Creek, Monaque&s;y, Fairfax, Goo&s;e Creek, and Southfork, wherein the Lord was plea&s;|ed in his wonted goodne&s;s and mercy to magnify his own name who is prai&s;e worthy for ever.</P>
<P>After a &s;ea&s;onable opportunity with friends held in the hou&s;e of Abel Janny at parting with them, we returned to Fairfax meeting on fir&s;t day, where under the influence of the Divine pre&s;ence, the te&s;|timony and doctrine of Truth flowed freely to the people, in a humble &s;en&s;e whereof, prai&s;es a&s;cended to his holy name who is over all worthy for ever.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEING &s;omewhat recovered of my indi&s;po&s;ition of body, I &s;at in our &s;elect meeting of mini|&s;ters and elders on the fir&s;t of the &s;econd month 1773, in which I was comforted under a &s;en&s;e of our being owned in &s;ome degree by the vi&s;itation of Divine love, and afterwards attended our quarterly-meeting at London-Grove, each &s;itting whereof was favoured with the continuance of heavenly help, to the encouragement of the humble waiters. I re|turned home with thankfulne&s;s in my mind to the Lord, who had furni&s;hed me with &s;trength in my weak &s;tate to &s;it with my friends, in which we ought to be good examples; I attended our own meeting on the fifth and fir&s;t days following, and in the &s;ame week went to Wilmington to the burial of Deborah Ferri&s;s before mentioned, after which, a &s;olid and profitable meeting was held.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;ixth of the third month I &s;et out from home in order to attend our general &s;pring meeting at Philadelphia, but did not get there in time for the fir&s;t &s;itting thereof, &s;uch of them as I
<PB N="237" REF="016223_0243_0F9BCF5E8FB96018">
did attend, I thought were in the main, times of Divine favour; on my return homeward I was at a &s;mall meeting at Che&s;ter, al&s;o the general meeting at Wilmington, and &s;oon after the general meeting at Duck. Creek, and their monthly-meeting preceed|ing it; the meeting there on fir&s;t day was large, and tho' a mixed multitude attended, it was &s;olid through the over&s;hadowing of heavenly power, the Lord was plea&s;ed to open the my&s;teries of the king|dom, influencing my heart to preach the Go&s;pel in the love thereof to my humble admiration, and many were tendered, for which renewed vi&s;itation and favour, a &s;acrifice of thank&s;giving a&s;cended from the hearts of his children, to the all powerful and merciful God who is worthy for ever; the meeting on &s;econd day was a time of con&s;olation to the heavy hearted, in&s;truction to the humble &s;eek|ers, and a &s;ea&s;on of &s;trengthening to the weak, ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord for his mercies endure for ever: I was next at George's Creek meeting, in which friends were encouraged, and in &s;ome degree refre&s;hed divers not of our &s;ociety attending; the doctrine of per&s;onal election and reprobation as held by &s;ome, was refuted, and it was clearly pointed out wherein the election &s;tood, viz. <HI>In Chri&s;t the &s;eed, which cleaved unto, and cho|&s;en by man, for his true in&s;tructor and leader by his light and witne&s;s in the heart as a reprover for &s;in, and &s;o followed and obeyed, man comes to know him|&s;elf elected in him.</HI> I went home with George Ford at Back Creek, and had an opportunity in his fa|mily I hope to &s;ome profit.</P>
<P>Towards the fall of the year I had a draught in my mind to attend &s;ome meetings in the Jer&s;eys, particularly the quarterly-meeting at Shrew&s;bury, of which having acquainted my brethren at home, and had there concurrence, after attending our yearly-meeting in Philadelphia and returning from
<PB N="238" REF="016223_0244_0F9BCF5F51CD76F0">
thence, I &s;et out in company with my friend Sa|muel England on the twelfth of the tenth month, but was detained at Philadelphia by a fever which held me &s;everal days, yet I &s;o far recovered as to proceed on our journey, taking on our way meet|ings at Mountholly, at a School-hou&s;e near Shreve's mount in upper Springfield, in which I had a con|cern to warn the youth to beware of Dei&s;m, and to &s;hew the ground and cau&s;e of falling into that er|ror, al&s;o at upper Freehold, and in a friend's hou&s;e near that called Robbins's meeting; there &s;eems to be a vi&s;itation to the youth in that place, to which if they are faithful that meeting may again increa&s;e; we reached the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders at Shrew&s;bury, in which truth owned the lovers there|of; the public meetings on the three following days were large, and thought to be the mo&s;t quiet and &s;atisfactory which had been known of late years there; the affairs of the di&s;cipline were, as I thought, pretty well conducted; finding my&s;elf not clear of the members of our &s;ociety at this place, I therefore propo&s;ed to &s;everal friends that they would favour me &s;o much as to meet on their week day meeting day, which I under&s;tood they u&s;ually had omitted in this week, reque&s;ting that they would acquaint their members with my de&s;ire of &s;eeing them, their children, and families together; I therefore waited until fifth day, when they gene|rally met, which gave me an opportunity comfort|ably to clear my&s;elf towards friends here, to the encouragment of the &s;incere, being led to &s;hew the active members the cau&s;e of dwarfi&s;hne&s;s, the love of the world, and its friend&s;hips, choaking the good &s;eed, which &s;hould grow and bear rule: I was thankful for this opportunity, and left them with the enjoyment of a quiet mind; from hence we pa&s;&s;ed to Rahway, had a meeting at Woodbridge, and another at Plainfield, in both which truth
<PB N="239" REF="016223_0245_0F9BCF60112056A0">
owned my &s;ervice; I thought there was a tender vi&s;itation renewed to friends in tho&s;e parts, in the &s;en&s;e whereof I was thankful, and that I had been favoured with &s;trength to pay them a vi&s;it in the love of my great and good ma&s;ter, may I ever walk an&s;werable to his manifold favours, who is prai&s;e worthy for ever! We were next at Stonybrook meeting, which was made precious in the renewing of Divine favour, and then at Trenton with a peo|ple who have much lo&s;t the life and &s;avour of truth; from thence going to Byberry and Philadelphia, I reached the quarterly-meeting, at Concord which be|gan on the &s;ixth of the eleventh month, the next day I went to Chiche&s;ter, where I was enabled to &s;peak to the &s;tates of the people in the love of truth, which may be u&s;eful if remembred in a right man|ner, and returned to the quarterly-meeting on &s;e|cond day, which was comfortable, the Divine pre|&s;ence being felt, our friend Elizabeth Robin&s;on was there, and had good &s;ervice; on third day I attend|ed the general meeting at Che&s;ter, which was poor and dull; the expectations of the people being too much outward, they were di&s;appointed; then at|tending the monthly-meeting at Wilmington, tar|ried their meeting the next day, and proceeded to our quarterly-meeting at London Grove, at which we had the company of our friends Robert Walker, Elizabeth Robin&s;on, and Mary Leaver from Great-Britain; it was a &s;ea&s;on of refre&s;hment and comfort to many friends; then went home, having travelled in this journey about 360 miles.</P>
<P>In the third month 1774, I attended our general &s;pring-meeting in Philadelphia, the divers &s;itttings whereof were divinely favoured; and after it, the general meeting at Wilmington, which was held chiefly in &s;ilence, and on that account remarkable.</P>
<P>Having an engagement on my mind for &s;ome time to vi&s;it friends on Long-I&s;land, with &s;ome ad|jacent
<PB N="240" REF="016223_0246_0F9BCF60CECABA58">
meetings, I laid it before my brethren, who gave me their certificate for that purpo&s;e; and on the third of the fifth month I &s;et out on the journey, having the company of a friend from Wilmington, taking a meeting at Philadelphia, we reached New-York, attended their morning and afternoon meet|ings on fir&s;t day, and had an opportunity with di|vers friends in the evening, which was to me (at lea&s;t) in&s;tructive, and I believe through Divine goodne&s;s profitable to &s;ome others. We then had meetings at We&s;t-Che&s;ter, Mamaroneck, and the Purcha&s;e, the la&s;t being a monthly-meeting; the&s;e opportunities were clo&s;e and &s;earching, the te&s;timony of Truth was encouraging to the well-minded, but very &s;harp to the formali&s;ts, and my mind was made thankful for the ble&s;&s;ing of peace in the di&s;charge of my duty. We next attended meetings at Flu&s;hing on Long-I&s;land, Cowneck, We&s;tbury, Matinicock, Sequitogue and Bethpage, then at Newtown, the monthly-meeting at We&s;t|bury, and the quarterly-meeting at Flu&s;hing, where the yearly-meeting began the next day, which held four days, and on the whole I believe it may be &s;aid, that the authority of Truth was in &s;ome good de|gree felt to keep down forward &s;pirits both in the mini&s;try and di&s;cipline, which was cau&s;e of thank|fulne&s;s to the Lord who rules among his children, and is worthy of all prai&s;e for ever; here I had the company of our dear friends Robert Walker, Eliz^a^. Robin&s;on, and Su&s;anna Lightfoot, who intending for Rhode-I&s;land, I parted with them, and went to the monthly-meeting at New-York, which through merciful regard was comfortable; from thence go|ing to Rahway, had a meeting at Plainfield which was &s;atisfactory through the extendings of Divine favour; then at Kingwood on fir&s;t day, from whence cro&s;&s;ing Delaware we were at Buckingham monthly meeting, where I thought the true Spirit of di&s;ci|pline
<PB N="241" REF="016223_0247_0F9BCF6332A24F90">
appeared to be much wanting in many; here my companion returned homewards; the next day I was at Wright's-town monthly-meeting, which through the Lord's ble&s;&s;ing was edifying to many, and we parted in peace and &s;weetne&s;s of Spirit, the day following I attended the meeting at Pine-&s;treet in Philadelphia, al&s;o that at High-&s;treet on fifth day, which was a precious opportunity to &s;uch who loved to live near the Spirit of Truth, from thence I went to vi&s;it my brother-in-law Daniel Brown near Che&s;ter, was at Newtown meeting on fir&s;t day, and at an afternoon meeting near Amos Yarnal's, then went to the general meetings at Go&s;hen, and Uwchlan, after which taking London-Grove meet|ing, I came home, having rode in this journey about 600 miles, and feeling a degree of thankful|ne&s;s that the Lord was plea&s;ed to give me ability to perform it.</P>
<P>I tarried much at home the remaining part of this &s;ummer; on the twenty-fir&s;t of the ninth month, I &s;et out in order to attend the yearly-meet|ing at Philadelphia, which was very large in the &s;everal &s;ittings, continued a full week, and I thought it the mo&s;t &s;olid and weighty in tran&s;acting the af|fairs of truth that I ever knew: The te&s;timony thereof again&s;t &s;lave keeping was wonderfully ex|alted, thro' the power and love of God who is wor|thy of all prai&s;e for ever. In my way home I was at Providence meeting, in which the te&s;timony of truth went forth by way of warning to the luke|warm and declining profe&s;&s;ors, and of encourag|ment to the youth.</P>
<P>Our general meeting at Nottingham next day was large, and I hope profitable to &s;ome; after which having a de&s;ire to be at the general meeting at Caecil in Maryland, I left home on the &s;eventh of the tenth month, was at the quarterly-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders there on fir&s;t day morning,
<PB N="242" REF="016223_0248_0F9BCF63D1D75E18">
which was profitably in&s;tructive through Divine Goodne&s;s; two public meetings for wor&s;hip were held on fir&s;t and &s;econd days, both large and &s;olid, &s;everal other friends from Penn&s;ylvania were there, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the quarterly-meeting ended on third day morning, on the &s;ame day we had a comforta|ble public meeting, from which we parted with friends in much love and nearne&s;s. On the follow|ing day was their monthly-meeting, to attend which &s;everal of us &s;taid; then having a de&s;ire to &s;ee friends at Che&s;ter-River, I went to their week day meeting, Nicholas Waln bearing me company; the meeting was large, and through the Lord's Good|ne&s;s, it was, I believe, made profitable to many; then taking meetings at Sa&s;&s;afra&s;s, Duck-Creek, Motherkill, and Little-Creek, the two la&s;t being their preparative meeting at each place, the next day was their &s;elect meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, and their monthly-meeting the day following, which, with divers other friends from Penn&s;ylvania, we attended, and on the fir&s;t and &s;econd days of the next week the general meeting at Little-Creek: I believe there is a renewed vi&s;itation to friends, and &s;ome others hereaway; but formal profe&s;&s;ors at pre&s;ent appear to be as &s;tumbling blocks by join|ing with the &s;pirit of the world; I returned home with an ea&s;y mind.</P>
<P>Weakne&s;s and infirmity of body gradually in|crea&s;ing upon our beloved friend, he frequently mentioned, that many years part, it was unexpected to him to live to his &s;eventieth year, and to be fa|voured with health and &s;trength &s;ufficient to travel &s;o much as he lately had, &s;aying, that now he &s;carcely thought much more would be required of him; he however attended the we&s;tern quarterly-meeting in the eleventh month this year, and in the &s;econd month 1775, in both which he was favoured
<PB N="243" REF="016223_0249_0F9BCF64B0E447F8">
with &s;trength and clearne&s;s to &s;peak to the &s;tate of the church, as well in &s;ome of the &s;elect, as the more public meetings, tending to the edification and comfort of many.</P>
<P>In the third month 1775, he al&s;o attended the general &s;pring-meeting at Philadelphia, and in &s;ome of the &s;ittings thereof was much favoured, on his return home from thence, he was at Wilmington general meeting, in company with our friends Ro|bert Walker and Elizabeth Robin&s;on from Great-Britain.</P>
<P>His la&s;t journey was on a vi&s;it to mo&s;t of the meetings on the Ea&s;tern-&s;hore of Maryland, and to attend the yearly-meeting at Thirdhaven in Talbot County, for which purpo&s;e he &s;et out from his own habitation on the twenty-&s;econd of the fifth month, having, according to his u&s;ual care, obtained the concurrence of his brethren, and was accompanied by a young man (William Jack&s;on) a member of New-Garden monthly-meeting, who has given the following account of this journey.</P>
<P>"Our fir&s;t days ride was to George Ford's near Back-Creek, the next morning being damp and foggy, was very trying to his weak con&s;titution, yet we rode forty five miles that day to Hannah Tur|ner's in Queen Ann's County, which was thought to be a means of bringing on him a di&s;order which proved painful and afflicting, and increa&s;ed till near his end, being advanced in age, his bodily infirmi|ties appeared great, but the fervency of his mind for the promotion of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and his care as a Father in I&s;rael, was truly as preva|lent as ever. On the twenty-fourth of the month he went to the preparative meeting at Tuckahoa, wherein he was concerned to exhort &s;ome to faith|fulne&s;s in times of temptation and tryal, that they might experience an overcoming, and be enabled to &s;trengthen their brethren. Next, day we attend|ed
<PB N="244" REF="016223_0250_0F9BCF654ED856B8">
Thirdhaven monthly-meeting, in which he was I qualified to &s;peak in&s;tructively to the members thereof, particularly to &s;uch who were incumbered with much care about the things of this life, things, which although lawful in them&s;elves, yet when &s;uf|fered to engro&s;s the minds and affections of people, ob&s;truct a progre&s;s in religion. On the twenty-&s;ixth a meeting at Choptank was a time of heavy exer|ci&s;e on account of a lifele&s;s, lukewarm, indifferent &s;ituation of mind, which &s;eemed to attend divers there a&s;&s;embled; the next day we attended a burial at Thirdhaven, on which occa&s;ion a meeting was held, and he laboured hone&s;tly to arou&s;e tho&s;e that lived in the neglect of making timely preparation for their la&s;t awful and &s;olemn change: On the twenty-eighth we were at Tuckahoa meeting, and on &s;econd day at the Bay-&s;ide, where were but few of our &s;ociety, but &s;everal others attended who be|haved &s;oberly, and &s;ome of the younger &s;ort were reached and tendered by Truth's Te&s;timony, to whom he was led in&s;tructively to &s;hew, <HI>That they need not give their money for that which is not bread, nor their labour for that which &s;atisfieth not,</HI> and opened to them the way of life and &s;alvation which is attained through <HI>the Spirit, or free gift of Grace that is come upon all men for ju&s;tification,</HI> &s;o that if they attended to the dictates thereof in their own hearts, it was &s;ufficient to in&s;truct them in the way of Godline&s;s, but when people go from, and ne|glect this inward teacher, &s;eeking to, or depending on learned men, they err."</P>
<P>"Next day we had a religious opportunity in the family of John Bartlett, and on fourth day went to Tuckahoa meeting again, where he had to &s;peak of the &s;ufficiency of the grace of God, and the in|con&s;i&s;tency of people's living in a profe&s;&s;ion thereof without being found in the faith, or fully believing in this principle as &s;ufficient for &s;alvation. We next
<PB N="245" REF="016223_0251_0F9BCF6615C6EF98">
attended the meetings at Thirdhaven, and Mar&s;hy-Creek; the yearly-meeting began on &s;eventh day, and continued until the fourth of the following week, which altho' he was feeble and unwell, he attended the &s;everal &s;ittings thereof, being nine in the five days, and the la&s;t held &s;even hours; he was enabled to appear for the cau&s;e and te&s;timony of truth, both in the meetings for wor&s;hip and di&s;ci|pline, and like the good &s;cribe well in&s;tructed in the things of the kingdom, had to bring forth out of the trea&s;ury, things new and old, profitable and in&s;tructive, being &s;ea&s;oned with the love and virtue of truth: After the meeting on fourth day, we went to the hou&s;e of Jo&s;eph Berry, where next morning had a religious opportunity in the family, and the day following a meeting in Queen Ann's Fore&s;t, from whence we went to Jo&s;hua Van&s;ant's; here he was very poorly, having taken &s;ome fre&s;h cold; the next day being very warm, he was much &s;pent with riding, and &s;aid, as he had at &s;everal times before on this journey, "that he believed it would be his la&s;t, if he lived to reach home, which at times he thought &s;eemed unlikely." On fir&s;t day the eleventh of the &s;ixth month he had a meeting in a School-hou&s;e at Back-Creek, among a people who behaved with much &s;obriety, which was a &s;atisfactory time, very in&s;tructive and open for doc|trine, and that evening reached home, having tra|velled in this journey about 290 miles."</P>
<P>On the fourteenth of the &s;ixth month he went to the week day meeting at London-Grove, to meet with a committee of our quarterly-meeting on par|ticular bu&s;ine&s;s, and returned to our meeting at Nottingham the next day, on the fir&s;t day of the week following, was there al&s;o, in the &s;ame week he attended our preparative and monthly-meetings, but a fever daily increa&s;ing upon him, he was af|terwards chiefly confined at home.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="016223_0252_0F9BCF66CEAB3BD8">On the fourth of the &s;eventh month he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus, "I am glad that I am at home, I have ever found it be&s;t when my &s;ervice abroad was over, to get home as quick as might be, and though I have felt great inward poverty, and weak|ne&s;s &s;ince my la&s;t journey, &s;o that I can neither &s;ee my beginning, nor ending, but &s;eem as if all were hidden, yet I hope if Providence &s;hall &s;ee meet to remove me at this time, &s;ome light will appear again, and that it will be otherwi&s;e before I go."</P>

I &s;up|po&s;e I have been accounted by &s;ome, as one of the better &s;ort of people, but have &s;een great occa&s;ion to beware of a di&s;po&s;ition that would &s;eek to feed upon the prai&s;e or commendations of others; a carnal &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit is very apt to pre&s;ent, and creep in here if po&s;&s;ible, and I have &s;een it hurt many who have had right beginnings, it always introduceth dimne&s;s, and oppre&s;&s;ion, to the pure, precious, innocent life of truth, which only groweth up into dominion, through deep aba&s;ement of &s;oul, and the entire death of &s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>At &s;everal other times he &s;ignified to this effect,
<Q>My pre&s;ent bapti&s;m of affliction hath tended to the further refinement of my nature, and to the bringing me more perfectly into the image of my ma&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>He frequently expre&s;&s;ed his full &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Divine Will either re&s;pecting life or death, &s;everal times &s;aying, "I now experience my life and my will to be &s;lain, and I have no will le&s;t."</P>
<P>In the two la&s;t weeks of his time it appeared that his de&s;ire and hope, mentioned in the forepart of his illne&s;s, for light again to appear was fully an&s;wer|ed by the fre&s;h influence thereof, &s;o that altho' his
<PB N="247" REF="016223_0253_0F9BCF67933A35F0">
pain was often great he would many times in a day break forth into a kind of melody with his voice, without uttering words, which as he &s;ometimes in|timated was an involuntary a&s;piration of his &s;oul in prai&s;e to the Lord who had again been plea&s;ed to &s;hine forth in brightne&s;s after many days of poverty and deep bapti&s;m, which tho' painful had proved beneficial to him, being a means of further purify|ing from the dregs of nature, &s;aying he was at times afraid to di&s;cover that melody in the hear|ing of &s;ome that vi&s;ited him, le&s;t they could not comprehend its meaning, and might therefore mi&s;|con&s;true it.</P>
<P>On &s;econd day morning the &s;eventeenth of the &s;eventh month being a&s;ked by a friend how he was, he replied, "<HI>I am here in the body yet, and when I go out of it I hope there is nothing but peace,</HI>" and &s;oon after further &s;aid, "<HI>I have &s;een that all the bu&s;tles, and noi&s;es that are now in the world will end in con|fu&s;ion, and our young men that know not an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment in the Truth and the Lord's fear for a balla&s;t will be caught in a trying moment,</HI>" at another time he &s;aid, "<HI>I feel nothing but peace, having endeavoured hone&s;tly to di&s;charge my&s;elf in public, and privately to individuals as I apprehended was required, and if it be the Lord's will that I &s;hould go now, I &s;hall be relea&s;ed from a great deal of trouble and exerci&s;e, which I believe friends who are left behind will have to pa&s;s through.</HI>"</P>
<P>On the twentieth of the &s;ame month he thus ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, "<HI>I love friends who abide in the truth as much as ever I did, and I feel earne&s;t breath|ings to the Lord, that there may be &s;uch rai&s;ed up in the church who may go forth in humility, &s;weetne&s;s, and life, clear of all &s;uperfluity in expre&s;&s;ions and otherwi&s;e, &s;tanding for the te&s;timony, that they may be u&s;eful to the church in the&s;e difficult times.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="016223_0254_0F9BCF684FA12110">About three days before his death &s;everal friends being in his room he &s;pake as follows, "Friends in the beginning, if they had health and liberty, were not ea&s;ily diverted from paying their tribute of wor&s;hip to the Almighty on week days as well as fir&s;t days, but after a while when outward &s;uffer|ings cea&s;ed, life and zeal decaying, ea&s;e and the &s;pirit of the world took place with many, and thus it became cu&s;tomary for one or two out of a family to attend meetings, and to leave their children much at home; parents al&s;o it worldly concerns were in the way could neglect their week day meet|ings &s;ometimes; yet be willing to hold the name, and plead excu&s;e becau&s;e of a bu&s;y time, or the like, but I believe that &s;uch a departure from pri|mitive integrity ever did, and ever will, occa&s;ion a withering from the life of true religion."</P>
<P>To a friend who came to vi&s;it him on the twenty-fir&s;t of the &s;eventh month he &s;aid, "<HI>I feel that which lives beyond death and the grave, which is now an inexpre&s;&s;ible comfort to me after a time of deep bapti&s;m that I have pa&s;&s;ed through, I believe my being continued here is in the will of Providence, and I am fully re&s;igned.</HI>"</P>
<P>His illne&s;s increa&s;ing he &s;aid but little on &s;eventh day the twenty-&s;econd; in the afternoon he was ve|ry low, and &s;peechle&s;s about twelve hours; early on fir&s;t day morning he recruited a little, and gave di|rections about his coffin to a friend who &s;at up with him being a joiner; continuing rather ea&s;ier the forepart of that day and appearing chearful, he ex|pre&s;&s;ed divers weighty &s;entences like farewell ex|hortations to &s;ome who came to &s;ee him; on &s;econd day morning he &s;at up a con&s;iderable time, in the afternoon he appeared lively and &s;en&s;ible, tho' very weak, thus expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, "<HI>I am much refre&s;hed with my Ma&s;ter's &s;weet air, I feel more life, more light, more love, and &s;weetne&s;s than ever before,</HI>"
<PB N="249" REF="016223_0255_0F9BCF69104AD278">
and often mentioned the Divine refre&s;hment and comfort he felt flowing like a pure &s;tream to his in|ward man, &s;aying to tho&s;e who were with him, "<HI>I may tell you of it, but you cannot feel it as I do.</HI>"</P>
<P>In the evening a young per&s;on coming into the room, looking at her earne&s;tly and affectionately, he &s;aid, "<HI>Deborah aro&s;e a mother in I&s;rael,</HI>" and &s;hortly after, "<HI>The &s;weetne&s;s that I feel,</HI>" then his difficulty of breathing increa&s;ed, and being turned once or twice he reque&s;ted to be helped up, and was placed in his chair, in which he expired about the ninth hour on &s;econd day night the twenty-fourth of the &s;eventh month 1775, being aged near &s;eventy, and mini&s;ter about forty-two years, and was buried on the twenty-&s;ixth in friend's Grave|yard at Ea&s;t-Nottingham, a large concour&s;e of peo|ple attending, after which a &s;olemn meeting was held.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>A TESTIMONY from the Falls Monthly-Meeting in Bucks County, concerning our Friend JOSEPH WHITE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Memory of the ju&s;t is pronounced ble&s;&s;ed, we think it expedient to give forth a te&s;ti|mony concerning this our e&s;teemed friend.</P>
<P>He was born at the Falls the twenty-eighth of the eleventh month 1712-13; being young when his father died, he was brought up under the care of his relations and friends: And through the early extendings of Heavenly regard whil&s;t young, and attending to the teachings of Divine Grace he was lead and pre&s;erved from many of the follies and extravagances incident to unthinking youth. About the twentieth year of his age he appeared in pub|lic te&s;timony in our religious meetings, and con|tinuing in a good degree faithful to the mea&s;ure of Light and Grace communicated, he grew in his gift, and became a lively and able mini&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="016223_0257_0F9BCF6A93DEAB80">He was naturally of an open cheerful di&s;po&s;ition, and hone&s;tly concerned for the promotion of piety and virtue, and for the &s;upport and maintenance of good order in the church; for which &s;ervice he was eminently gifted, and truly &s;erviceable among&s;t us, being often concerned that the authority of Truth might be kept up in all our meetings of di&s;|cipline, and that true judgment might be placed upon the di&s;orderly and irreclaimable. He was ex|amplary in his life and conver&s;ation, a diligent and timely attender of our religious meetings when health of body permitted; and was often favoured therein in public te&s;timony and &s;upplication, much to the comfort and edification of the truly humble waiters. And altho' he had a large gift in the mi|ni&s;try, he many times &s;at meetings in &s;ilence, wait|ing upon the Lord, not being ha&s;ty or forward in the exerci&s;e of his gift; but careful not to mini&s;ter without the Heavenly Life and Power that fir&s;t rai&s;|ed him up in the mini&s;try, whereby his public &s;er|vice was greatly to the con&s;olation and refre&s;hment of many.</P>
<P>He &s;everal times had a concern to vi&s;it the churches abroad, and with the concurrence of this meeting, vi&s;ited many of the meetings of friends in this and &s;everal of the adjacent provinces, and once through &s;ome parts of Maryland, Virginia and North-Caro|lina: And having for &s;ome con&s;iderable time been under a weighty concern to pay a religious vi&s;it to friends in &s;everal parts of Europe, he with the concurrence and unity of his friends took &s;hipping for that purpo&s;e in the year 1758, and after a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age landed in England, and having pretty gene|rally vi&s;ited friends meetings in England and Ire|land, and &s;ome parts of Wales, he returned to his family and friends, having been from home in truth's &s;ervice near three years: And at his return from the&s;e vi&s;its produced certificates of friends
<PB N="252" REF="016223_0258_0F9BCF6B507DF838">
unity and good &s;atisfaction with him, and his pub|lick &s;ervice among&s;t them.</P>
<P>He was divers times appointed and engaged in the &s;ervice of vi&s;iting families, being well qualified for that weighty &s;ervice.</P>
<P>He much loved the company and conver&s;ation of his friends; was a loving and affectionate hu&s;band, a tender parent and a good neighbour, generally beloved by his friends and others that knew him, being in &s;everal re&s;pects u&s;eful and &s;erviceable in the neighbourhood where he lived.</P>
<P>He was attended from his youth at times, with a pain at his brea&s;t, with intermi&s;&s;ions of health, &s;ometimes for years, and at other times but &s;hort; but as he advanced further in age, intermi&s;&s;ions of health grew &s;hort and pain encrea&s;ed, which brought on other bodily infirmities, which he bore with patience and re&s;ignation, often craving he might not be off his watch when his pains were exqui&s;ite, nor his faith fail in the time of trial, believing it to be the goodne&s;s of God, through his thus deal|ing with him, more and more to wean him from all outward connections and neare&s;t ties of nature, that being as the pure gold, refined through the furnace, he might with triumph join the redeemed that were gone before, which he at times had a foreta&s;te and evidence of; but the time when, as he him&s;elf &s;ometimes expre&s;&s;ed, he did not then &s;ee, believing it to be con&s;i&s;tent with Divine Wi&s;dom to keep it hid from him.</P>
<P>The latter part of his time for &s;everal months, he &s;lept but little in the night &s;ea&s;on, being at times engaged in reverent interce&s;&s;ions and Divine con|templation, and appeared to be waiting for the &s;o|lemn moment.</P>
<P>He lived in the compa&s;s of the Falls particular meeting until a few years before his death, and then removed to Makefield, (a branch of the &s;ame
<PB N="253" REF="016223_0259_0F9BCF6C0F035688">
monthly-meeting,) and having for &s;ome months felt &s;trong de&s;ires (if favoured with health) to go to the Falls meeting, and on a monthly-meeting day &s;et out to go there; but the weather being cold and he in a weak &s;tate of health, &s;oon found him&s;elf unable to perform the journey, and returned home. But &s;ome time after feeling his bodily &s;trength &s;ome|what re&s;tored, and love renewed, he &s;et out, in company with his wife, one fir&s;t day morning, and got to the meeting where he was favoured with an open time in publick te&s;timony, much to the &s;ati&s;|faction of tho&s;e pre&s;ent. After the meeting was over and friends gone out, a friend being de&s;irous of &s;peaking to him, not &s;eeing him out of doors, returned into the hou&s;e, and found him &s;itting on a &s;eat, unable to move without help; the friend a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, and took him to his hou&s;e, where he was taken care of: The fit being of the paralytick kind, was much more favourable than at &s;ome other times, tho' it continued ebbing and flowing for &s;eve|ral hours; in which time he expre&s;&s;ed &s;everal things, &s;ome of which being then taken down, are nearly as follows.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked by his &s;on Samuel how it was with him; he an&s;wered, "<HI>I dont know but that I am near my end. My de&s;ire at this time for thee is, that thou &s;eek unto the Lord for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to govern thee in thy conduct in this fluctuating life, for I have found him to be a &s;ure help and coun&s;ellor to me; and if thou fol|low after him in truth and &s;incerity, as I have endea|voured to do, he will be unto thee a &s;ufficient director, a Teacher that cannot be removed into a corner: I have not been anxious to gather a portion of this world, nor make to my&s;elf mammon of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, for I think I have &s;een a &s;nare that has attended many young people on the&s;e accounts. I have ever from my youth had a de&s;ire to be more in &s;ub&s;tance than in &s;hew: Let me appear as I might in the &s;ight of men,
<PB N="254" REF="016223_0260_0F9BCF6E5A6B4A58">
their prai&s;e I &s;ought not for; but I have &s;ought the honour of God, therefore there is a place where no trouble &s;hall annoy, prepared for me as a reward for obedience: You that &s;tay, be more humble, and when trouble awaits you, look not upon nor tru&s;t to the arm of fle&s;h for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but &s;tay your&s;elves upon him who &s;uffered for you, for me, and for all mankind; for I have for &s;ome time believed, and lived in the hopes thereof, and am now in mea&s;ure confirmed, of more glorious things yet to be revealed to the church of Chri&s;t, and that further and greater di&s;coveries will yet be made, with re&s;pect to the Chri&s;tian Religion than ever yet has been &s;ince the apo&s;ta&s;y.</HI>"</P>
<P>And after a &s;hort pau&s;e he broke forth in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, "<HI>The door is open, I &s;ee an innumerable company of &s;aints, of Angels, and of the Spirits of ju&s;t men, which I long to be unbodied to be with, but not my will, but thy will be done O Lord! I cannot utter nor my tongue expre&s;s, what I feel of that Light, Life and Love that attends me, which the world can|not give, neither can it take away from me. My &s;ins are wa&s;hed away by the blood of the Lamb that was &s;lain from the foundation of the world: All rags and filthine&s;s are taken away, and in room thereof love and good will for all mankind: O that we may become more united in the church militant, and nearer re&s;em|ble the church triumphant! O that we all might make &s;uch an end as I have in pro&s;pect, for its all Light, all Life, all Love and all Peace, the light that I &s;ee is more glorious than the Sun in the Firmament; come Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, come when thou plea&s;es, thy &s;er|vant is ready and willing; into thy hands I commit my &s;pirit, not my will, but thy will be done O Lord! Let this mortal body be committed to the du&s;t, be with me, with my children and my grand-children; be with all them that love thee, that love thy appearance. O the pains that I feel, that attend this mortal body, they are more comely to me than jewels! I rejoice in my
<PB N="255" REF="016223_0261_0F9BCF6F16ED6A50">
&s;ighs and groans, for to me they are mo&s;t melodious; I am near to enter that harmony with Mo&s;es and the Lamb, where they cry Holy, Holy, Holy, I cannot ex|pre&s;s the joy I feel. My heart (if it were po&s;&s;ible) would break for joy: If any enquire after me, after my end, let them know all is well with me.</HI>"</P>
<P>Many more weighty expre&s;&s;ions he &s;poke, which not being taken down, cannot be recollected.</P>
<P>The next day his pain abating, and finding him|&s;elf &s;omewhat relieved from his di&s;order, he was taken to his own hou&s;e, where he remained in a weak &s;tate of health for &s;ometime, being unable to go much abroad. And one night &s;ome &s;hort time before his death, his pain had been &s;harp the fore|part of the night, but the latter part it abating, his wife lay down by him, and fell a&s;leep, but he as u&s;ual &s;lept not, but after &s;ometime called to his wife in the&s;e words: "<HI>My dear, I believe I mu&s;t take my leave of thee, I have never &s;een my end till now, and now I &s;ee its near, and the Holy Angels en|clo&s;e me around, waiting to receive me;</HI>" his wife a&s;k|ed him if &s;he &s;hould call up the children, he &s;aid, he did not &s;ee any thing further he had to &s;ay to them, except to his &s;on Jo&s;eph who being called, and he having expre&s;t what he had on his mind, was much &s;pent, and appeared as tho' he was near his de&s;ired port; but after &s;ome time he revived, with the&s;e words, "<HI>Life is yet &s;trong in me and will not yield;</HI>" thus he continued the few concluding days, waiting in re&s;ignation and retiredne&s;s of mind, until the repeated returns of the paralytick com|plaint reduced his faculties and &s;en&s;es &s;o, that he knew not what was done for &s;ome days, and departed in much &s;tillne&s;s as in a &s;leep, the tenth day of the third month 1777, and was decently interred in friend's burying ground at the Fall's meeting-hou&s;e, the twelfth of the &s;ame; his body being attended to the grave by a number of friends and neighbours.</P>
