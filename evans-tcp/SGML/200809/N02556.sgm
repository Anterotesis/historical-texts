</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE ver&s;es preceeding give us the hi&s;tory of the death of <HI>Aaron</HI> the high-prie&s;t upon mount <HI>Hor:</HI> and our text is an account of the general and publick lamentation to which the LORD'S people thought them&s;elves called upon that occa&s;ion; <HI>And when all the congregation &s;aw that</HI> Aaron <HI>was dead, they mourned for</HI> Aaron <HI>thirty days, even all the hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael.</P>
<P>THESE words are cho&s;en to employ our meditations, at a &s;ea&s;on when GOD in His Providence is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">bling us under His mighty hand; and calling our whole land to mourn for the death of ONE, who was a very &s;ignal ble&s;&s;ing to it: but &s;uch are the impre&s;&s;ions of this providence on a mind, which from a natural weakne&s;s is too ea&s;ily over-born and di&s;ordered by le&s;&s;er occa&s;ions of greif and &s;orrow; and &s;uch al&s;o have been my bound infirmities, as allow me to give you but a few broken &amp; imperfect tho'ts upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003031_0004_0FEFAFA882E948F8">
IT would have indulged my prevailing temper, if, for a while at lea&s;t, I might have appeared among the &s;ilent mourners in this hou&s;e; to hear you en|tertained by my fathers and brethren, with that which might do greater honour to the dead, and &s;ervice to the living than, at the be&s;t, I may think my &s;elf capable of. But I dare not indulge the tho'ts of this; from a lively per&s;ua&s;ion of it, that for me to faint in the day of adver&s;ity would be as truly my &s;in, as for me to de&s;pi&s;e the cha&s;tening of the LORD. Tis therefore my de&s;ire to be found in the cour&s;e of my duty, running with patience the race &s;et before me, and looking up to JESUS for &s;trength to perform it; that His &s;trength may be glorified in my weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch a temper I would now proceed to a more particular con&s;ideration of the words of my text; without any &s;ollicitude for a critical exactne&s;s in the handling of them. And here,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THE congregation &s;aw that <HI>Aaron</HI> was dead.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THEY mourned for <HI>Aaron</HI> thirty days.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. ALL the congregation, even all the hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> were &s;uch mourners for him.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>A few brief reflections upon the&s;e things ob&s;ervable in the words, may prepare us to take a more par|ticular notice of the mournful occa&s;ion, which in the providence of GOD has made them a proper &s;ubject for our contemplation.</P>
<P>AND</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE congregation &s;aw that</HI> Aaron <HI>was dead.</HI></P>
<P>A few ver&s;es before our text we read, that he went up with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Eleazar</HI> into mount <HI>Her,</HI> in the &s;ight of all the congregation: who now under&s;tood, by the report of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &amp; <HI>Eleazar,</HI> and by other &s;igns, that <HI>Aaron</HI> was dead: &s;ad and awful news, like this, would run quick thro' the camp of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and it could not be long before <HI>all the congregation &s;aw</HI> that <HI>Aaron</HI> was dead.</P>

AARON the Saint of the LORD was a per&s;on ex|traordinarily furni&s;hed, &s;pirited, and called to do &s;ervice for GOD, and His people in the church of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> He was an eloquent man; concerning whom GOD Him&s;elf bore witne&s;s, that he could <HI>&s;peak well</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> 4.14.</NOTE>: well for GOD to men, and well for men to GOD. He was the LORD's high-prie&s;t; and his family was be|times advanced to be at the head of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical order <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> 28 1</NOTE>: when GOD entred into covenant with the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> nation; governing them, as His church by more fixed methods, than were known under the partriarchal &s;tate; and e&s;tabli&s;ting a regular prie&s;t|hood among them. He was a per&s;on who&s;e character and authority GOD had a&s;&s;erted and evidenced again&s;t all that reviled &amp; oppo&s;ed him: his rod miraculou&s;ly budded and blo&s;&s;omed <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Numb.</HI> 17.8.</NOTE>; and his brethren that mur|mured again&s;t him were mo&s;t remarkably puni&s;hed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Num.</HI> 16.</NOTE>. He was an illu&s;trious pattern of the humble&s;t re&s;ig|nation, when the judgments of GOD came near to him&s;elf <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lev.</HI> 10.3.</NOTE>; &s;ilently &s;uffering the &s;ore&s;t bereavements, and turning his lo&s;&s;es into &s;piritual &s;acrifices&punc; while he was at the &s;ame time as great a pattern of quick di&s;patch and fervent importunity in his offerings and interce&s;&s;ions for others; to avert the divine judgments that were ready to devour and &s;wallow them up <NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Num.</HI> 16.</NOTE>. He was a man ju&s;tly affected with their folly, &s;in and danger who were for making them a captain to return into <HI>Egypt</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Num.</HI> 14.</NOTE>, and who by murmuring &amp; di&s;pi&s;ing the good land provoked the LORD to de&s;troy them in His anger.

He was one of them who were appointed, as chief magi&s;trates, to judge <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and keep the peace and good order in the congrega|tion; when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was called up into the mount to receive the tables of the law <NOTE N="&Verbar;&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> 24.14.</NOTE>: and this &s;peaks his reputation for wi&s;dom and faithfulne&s;s.</P>

THESE, I think, are the main &s;trokes of <HI>Aarom</HI> character, as it appears di&s;per&s;ed in the &s;acred hi&s;tory. The time will not allow us, as we pa&s;s along, to take a particular notice of all the agreable circum|&s;tances by which this character might be illu&s;trated. But from the&s;e general touches it is evident that, not-notwith&s;tanding any events wherein he di&s;covered him&s;elf to be a man of like pa&s;&s;ions with others, he was truly an extraordinary per&s;on: a bright ornament and &s;ingular honour to the church of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> one whom they greatly needed to continue among them; and who&s;e departure from them mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be accounted a great and uncommon lo&s;s indeed.</P>
<P>BUT after all, as few infirmities as he had, and as great an ornament and defence as he was to the church &amp; people of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> yet he was <HI>not &s;uffered to continue by rea&s;on of death:</HI> and <HI>all the con|gregation &s;aw that</HI> Aaron <HI>was dead</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>ju&s;t &s;o it is with the mo&s;t eminent mini&s;ters of the church of GOD in every generation.</HI> How|ever di&s;tingui&s;hed with gifts and graces, activity and u&s;efulne&s;s, as might tempt the world from a principle of &s;elf-love to wi&s;h they might never &s;ee death; yet <HI>our fathers where are they? and the prophets, do they live forever?</HI> They dwell in hou&s;es of clay like other Men; and their labours often wear and di&s;&s;olve the earthly tabernacles. Sometimes GOD calls them home; becau&s;e they are ill treated, as pilgrims and &s;trangers, in a world that is not worthy of them. Sometimes they are taken away from evil to come: they are called up to enter into their chambers, that they may not &s;ee the indignation that is coming on a &s;inful people. But if the&s;e things were intirely out of the ca&s;e, yet they are men: and 'tis appointed for them to dy: and they are &s;uch men as have been lay|ing up their trea&s;ures in heaven; their reward is there, and thither they unit go to receive it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="003031_0007_0FEFAFAFC7C3F9E0">
II. I pa&s;s now to the next thing ob&s;ervable in the words; which is, That when the congregation &s;aw that <HI>Aaron</HI> was dead, <HI>they mourned for</HI> Aaron <HI>thirty days.</HI></P>
<P>WE may not expect to arrive at any certainty about the ceremonials of their mourning. In the ori|ginal it is, they <HI>wept</HI> thirty days: but <HI>weeping,</HI> which is there evidently to be under&s;tood in a larger &s;en&s;e for <HI>mourning,</HI> takes in all the proper methods whereby men expre&s;s their &s;orrow for the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained in the death of tho&s;e whom they had rea|&s;on to love and honour.</P>
<P>AND it has ever been allowed, that <HI>when GOD takes &s;uch per&s;ons away from us by death, 'tis our duty to mourn for them;</HI> not only to have an in|ward &s;orrowful &s;en&s;e of the lo&s;s we have &s;u&s;tained, but in all proper and decent ways to expre&s;s the grief of our hearts.</P>
<P><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> THE manner of mourning for the dead has been various, according to the &s;everal cu&s;toms of countries. The better to expre&s;s their &s;orrow for the lo&s;s of departed friends, it has been common with the world to differ as much as could be from their ordinary habit and behaviour. A mo&s;t u&s;ual me|thod has been to refrain from every thing that oc|ca&s;ioned mirth, and look'd gay and plea&s;ant; as what was unfit to be received among mourners: to re|frain from the comforts and conveniences of life's and to fa&s;t and wear habits not only differing in colour from their ordinary apparel, but al&s;o in value, as being only of a cheaper and cour&s;er &s;tuff. The&s;e are ob&s;erved to be cu&s;toms practi&s;ed among the an|cients, in the <HI>ea&s;tern</HI> countries; where they would al&s;o &s;prinkle du&s;t upon their heads, nay, fowl in the very dirt Fience we find &s;o frequent mention of peniten's lying on the ground, and putting on &s;ack|cloth
<PB N="6" REF="003031_0008_0FEFAFB158BE32B0">and a&s;hes. They were &s;o far from wearing the be&s;t apparel, that they frequently burned their riche&s;t goods and cloaths, as well as tore what they had off their backs, on the fir&s;t news of any great calamity. So <HI>Jacob rent his cloaths, and put &s;ack|cloth on his loins, and mourned for his &s;on many days,</HI> Gen. 37.34. And the &s;cripture-hi&s;tory affords many in&s;tances of this mourning in &s;ackloth and a&s;hes. But the&s;e tokens of grief were accompanied al&s;o with mourning tears; which not only expre&s;s our love to a friend, and our &s;orrow for the lo&s;s of him, but tend to moderate our pa&s;&s;ions, and allay our concern. And weeping for the dead is &s;o far from an unju&s;tifiable weakne&s;s, that we find examples of it in the greate&s;t and be&s;t of men. How did <HI>Abraham</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> 23.2.</NOTE> weep and mourn for his <HI>Sarah, Jo&s;eph</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> 50.1, 10, 11.</NOTE> for his fa|ther <HI>Jacob,</HI> and <HI>David</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 232</NOTE> for his Children? And not to multiply in&s;tances, did not our ble&s;&s;ed SA|VIOUR weep over the grave of <HI>Lazarus</HI> <NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">33, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> 11.35.</NOTE> whom he loved, as well as over ob&s;tinate <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke.</HI> 19 41.</NOTE> who&s;e de&s;olation he fore&s;aw coming on her? Which is enough to &s;atisfy us, that as GOD has given us na|tural affections, we may u&s;e them aright, and yet let them reach to the memory as well as life of them we love, and break out in mourning tears. And thus we &s;hould weep and mourn for our dead <HI>friends:</HI> we &s;hould be grieved for their death, and &s;uitably expre&s;s our grief according to the decent cu&s;toms of the times and places where we live.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould likewi&s;e mourn for the death of all <HI>good and u&s;eful men,</HI> according to their re&s;pective characters and &s;tations. So when GOD takes away pious and u&s;eful per&s;ons in a <HI>private capacity;</HI> when the righteous peri&s;h, and merciful men are taken away; who&s;e good works, prayers and holy example were of great &s;ervice in the places where they lived:
<PB N="7" REF="003031_0009_0FEFAFB3DD5DA3A0">this calls for &s;orrow and mourning. And it doth &s;o more e&s;pecially, when he takes away &s;uch men of a <HI>public character,</HI> &s;ingularly qualified for, and faithful in their &s;everal po&s;ts and &s;tations.</P>
<P>BUT our &s;ubject leads us more particularly to be &s;en&s;ible of our obligations to mourn for the death of <HI>eminent, holy and u&s;eful mini&s;ters;</HI> as <HI>the con|gregation mourned for</HI> Aaron. They mourned not upon his account, as if it were not better for him to depart than to abide in the fle&s;h: but for their own lo&s;s in his death. For tho' the ble&s;&s;ed hope was not &s;o clearly revealed to them, as it is to us under the Go&s;pel; yet they had light enough under that di&s;pen&s;ation to keep them from mourning with|out hope in the death of &s;uch faithful &s;ervants of the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> Much le&s;s can we think our&s;elves called thus to mourn for the death of eminent, holy and u&s;eful mini&s;ters; &s;ince life and immortality are brought to light by the go&s;pel, thro' JESUS CHRIST who is the re&s;urrection and the life. No, as for them, the day of their death is better than the day of their birth; for by death GOD takes them to Him&s;elf. When they depart, it is that they may be with CHRIST; which is far better than to abide in the fle&s;h: they enter into re&s;t; <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the dead which dy in the</HI> LORT, <HI>from henceforth, yea, &s;aith the Spirit, that they may re&s;t from their labours and their works do follow them</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> 14.13.</NOTE> And we are well a&s;&s;ured, that the time and manner or their death is ordered by infinite wi&s;dom and infinite goodne&s;s, as &s;hall be truly be&s;t for them. In&s;tead therefore of mourning for them, we have cau&s;e rather to be thank|ful for their deliverance from &s;o great, and &s;uch ma|nifold evils as we are here expo&s;ed to, whom they leave behind them in this &s;inful world.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="003031_0010_0FEFAFB60ACF1318">
BUT tho' we have &s;uch cau&s;e to rejoice in their gain, yet we mu&s;t mourn for our own lo&s;s, and the great lo&s;s we have &s;u&s;tained in their death. For the taking away of the <HI>prophet,</HI> i. e. &s;uch as mini|&s;ter in holy things, di&s;pen&s;e the word of GOD to us, and treat with us in His name, upon the great points that concern our &s;piritual and eternal intere&s;ts; this is to be reckoned among the frowns of Heaven, as well as the taking away of the <HI>mighty man, the man of war, and the judge:</HI> and it may be tho't the greater lo&s;s to them who are left behind. We &s;hould not fail therefore in all proper methods to expre&s;s our &s;orrow upon &s;uch occa&s;ions: like them who <HI>wept &s;ore, &s;orrowing for the words that</HI> Paul <HI>&s;pake, that they &s;hould &s;ee his face no more</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Act.</HI> 20.33.</NOTE>. This is an honour due to their memory; however we treated them in their lives. For &s;uch eminent holy and u&s;eful mini&s;ters are great ble&s;&s;ings to their peo|ple, while they live; and all under their charge, if it be not their own fault, mu&s;t receive great benefit from them. But whether we have received &s;uch ad|vantage or no; and if we have abu&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ings, and thro' our own fault have lo&s;t the benefit; yet &s;till we are bound to mourn for their death and de|parture from us.</P>
<P>AND here an inquiry into the <HI>&s;pecial grounds</HI> of mourning upon the death of eminent, holy, and u&s;e|ful mini&s;ters would offer it &s;elf to our more particular con&s;ideration: but I may not enlarge upon it.</P>
<P N="1">1. ONE &s;pecial ground and rea&s;on of it may be taken from the opportunities and advantages for re|ceiving good by their mini&s;try, which are <HI>lo&s;t</HI> in their death. We are commanded to <HI>remember tho&s;e</HI> &s;piritu|al <HI>rulers, who have &s;poken to us the word of GOD,</HI> Heb. 13.7. But how do we comply with this com|mand,
<PB N="9" REF="003031_0011_0FEFAFB942976808">unle&s;s we remember the gifts and graces that were in them, with all the good we have received by their means, and what opportunities &amp; advantages we &s;hould &s;till have had for getting good by them, if GOD had &s;pared their lives? And is it po&s;&s;ible for us to remember them after &s;uch a manner, without find|ing it work upon our affections in a &s;en&s;e of our want, and in grief for our lo&s;s? While GOD &s;pares their lives, whom He has eminently gifted and qualified for the mini&s;terial office, and makes faithful in it, they are &s;piritual <HI>&s;hepherds</HI> and <HI>watchmen</HI> to the &s;ouls of their people. On the account of their doctrine &amp; example, our SAVIOUR teaches us to call &s;uch men the <HI>&s;alt of the earth,</HI> and the <HI>lights of the world:</HI> For as the virtue of <HI>&s;alt</HI> lies in &s;ea&s;oning other things, and keeping them from corruption: &s;o by their life and doctrine, &s;uch eminent, holy, and u&s;eful mini&s;ters do &s;ea&s;on the manners of men and keep them from the putrifaction of &s;in. And as the <HI>&s;un</HI> di&s;pells the mi&s;ts of darkne&s;s which over&s;pread the earth, and enables men to walk and act after &s;uch a manner as may be&s;t an&s;wer the ends of life: &s;o they, by their doctrine and example, di&s;pel the darkne&s;s, and cure the blind+ne&s;s of mens minds; and enlighten them with know|ledge and holine&s;s. And how many and great are the ble&s;&s;ings, which they who live under their charge have opportunities and advantages for receiving by their mini&s;try?</P>
<P>BUT now all the&s;e opportunities and advantages are lo&s;t, when &s;uch mini&s;ters are taken away by death. Such a time therefore is to be regarded as a time of &s;uffering, and on that account a time of mourning. For doth not the hand of the LORD &s;eem to be out again&s;t us, when He takes away &s;uch advantages and opportunities from us? Is not &s;uch a bereave|ment to be con&s;idered as a token of divine di&s;plea&s;ure? And &s;hould we not therefore be &s;orrowfully affected and mourn under it? What &s;tupidity doth it argue to be unaffected under GOD's afflicting hand: if we are <HI>not grieved when He &s;trikes us, but refu&s;e to to receive correction?</HI> Jer. 5.3.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003031_0012_0FEFAFBB93680C50">
BUT then no man is to con&s;ider him&s;elf alone under &s;uch bereavements. And if natural affection and humane tenderne&s;s will lead us to con&s;ider the part which our neare&s;t relatives, children, and friends may bear with us in them; the principles of chri&s;tia|nity will take into our concern and &s;ympathy all that may be called to mourn with us; tho' related neither by the bonds of nature nor of grace. The death of &s;uch mini&s;ters &s;hould be grievous al&s;o to them who are not immediately bereaved, but only &s;ee what rea&s;on others have to mourn under their &s;ufferings and lo&s;&s;es. For as we &s;hould rejoice with them that rejoice: &s;o we &s;hould mourn with them that mourn. And per&s;ons are often called to mourn for the death of mini&s;ters, by way of chri&s;tian &s;ym|pathy with others who are therein bereaved of &s;ignal opportunities &amp; advantages for getting good.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER &s;pecial ground and rea&s;on of mourn|ing upon, the death of eminent, holy, and u&s;eful mini&s;ters may be taken from the <HI>neglect</HI> or <HI>abu&s;e</HI> of &s;uch opportunities and advantages, while they were enjoyed under their mini&s;try. In the death of &s;uch mini&s;ters GOD may puni&s;h the &s;ins of their peo|ple; who under &s;uch a bereavement &s;hould always &s;u&s;pect them&s;elves, and con&s;ider, whether GOD is not now bringing their &s;ins to remembrance. And in order to find out wherefore GOD contendeth with them, they ought &s;eriou&s;ly to examin them&s;elves, whether the opportumities and advantages which now they have lo&s;t, were not &s;infully neglected or abu&s;ed. Now 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for us at &s;uch a time to take this method, but we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily di&s;cover &s;ufficient grounds of mourning upon the death of emi|nent, holy and u&s;eful mini&s;ters: as the very be&s;t of us, upon a &s;erious examination, mu&s;t &s;ee and own that we have not come up to our duty in the entertainment we gave to them, and to the me&s;&s;ages which they bro't us in GOD's name. For if we call our &s;elves to a &s;trict account (as GOD expects we &s;hould) how we have attended their mini&s;try; how we have
<PB N="11" REF="003031_0013_0FEFAFBED3ADF2D8">received the doctrines of godline&s;s which they deli|vered; how we followed the holy example which they &s;et before us; how we delighted in their u&s;e|fulne&s;s; and how we have glorified GOD in them, by con&s;idering them only as in&s;truments, and a&s;cri|bing to Him the glory which is due to His name, for all the excellencies which adorned them, and made them &s;o de&s;ireable and u&s;eful in the World: I &s;ay, if we duely reflect upon the&s;e things, the very be&s;t of us will find, that the opportunities &amp; advantages for receiving good by their mini&s;try have been too much neglected or abu&s;ed. And according as we have been guilty in one or both of the&s;e regards, we &s;hould humble our &s;elves, and mourn with godly &s;orrow before the LORD; confe&s;&s;ing that He is righte|ous to take away the ble&s;&s;ings, which we received no better, and imployed no more to His glory, while we had them.</P>
<P>BUT then if it could be &s;uppo&s;ed, that any par|ticular per&s;ons &s;hould upon a ju&s;t enquiry find them|&s;elves entirely clear and innocent in the&s;e re&s;pects; yet they have the &s;ins of others to mourn for; if they would not be partakers with them. When we think how opportunities and advantages of getting good by eminent, holy and u&s;eful mini&s;ters have been neglected and abu&s;ed, we have rea&s;on to fear that GOD hath taken them away in his anger: the ap|prehen&s;ions of which &s;hould make us mourn for our lo&s;s; whether we apprehend it inflicted as a puni&s;h|ment upon our &s;elves or upon others.</P>
<P N="3">3. ANOTHER ground of mourning on the death of &s;uch mini&s;ters is, That we can be <HI>no longer de|lighted with beholding their eminently-u&s;eful lives,</HI> in the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e gifts and grace which GOD had be&s;towed upon them. They who are governed by the refined and exalted &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity, can|not behold others act up to their character, and glo|rify GOD by employing their gifts and graces accor|ding to their &s;everal callings and relations, without
<PB N="12" REF="003031_0014_0FEFAFC12ABB7018">finding a very high delight and plea&s;ure in it: like the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> who <HI>joyed to behold the order and the &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s of their faith,</HI> wherewith the <HI>Colo&s;&s;ians</HI> glorified GOD <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col. 2, 5.</NOTE>; Such a plea&s;ure will naturally re&s;ult from the principles of our holy reli|gion, while we ob&s;erve the numberle&s;s projections and e&s;&s;ays to do good wherewith GOD is glorified by eminent, holy and u&s;eful mini&s;ters. And this plea|&s;ure will increa&s;e upon beholding the &s;ucce&s;s of their labours, in proportion as we have rea&s;on to think, that glory redounds to the name of GOD, and good is done to the &s;ouls of men. But the death of &s;uch men puts a period to the plea&s;ure of beholding their u&s;eful lives; which will be con&s;idered by wi&s;e and good men as one &s;pecial ground of mourning for it.</P>
<P>THUS we have taken notice of our duty to mourn for the death of eminent, holy and u&s;eful mini&s;ters: as the congregation mourned for <HI>Aaron.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the congregation <HI>mourned for</HI> Aaron <HI>thirty days:</HI> which may lead us to this remark upon it; <HI>That when we mourn for the death of good and u&s;eful men, whom we had rea&s;on to love and honour; we &s;hould have regard to their &s;pecial character and &s;tation.</HI> The congregation did not content them&s;elves to mourn for AARON <HI>&s;even</HI> day, which was the time appointed for per&s;ons of a private character; by they mourned <HI>thirty</HI> days; which, the learned tell us, was the time of mourning allotted for men of a public character <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dru&s;</HI> &amp; <HI>Ain&s;w.</HI> in loc.</NOTE>. Eminent mini&s;ter are to be con|&s;idered as public per&s;ons: and as GOD has furni&s;hed, &s;pirited, and employed them while they lived; we &s;hould accordingly mourn for them after an extraor|dinary manner when they are dead. The death of private per&s;ons is not &s;o great and exten&s;ive a lo&s;s, as the death of &s;uch mini&s;ters: the death of the&s;e therefore
<PB N="13" REF="003031_0015_0FEFAFC37954BE18">&s;hould rai&s;e a greater &s;orrow in our hearts, and calls for a greater degree of mourning than the death of private per&s;ons. If we &s;hould mourn for the one &s;ort &s;even days, we &s;hould mourn for the other &s;ort thirty days: As the congregation mourned for <HI>Aaron;</HI> ha|ving a &s;pecial regard to his eminent character and &s;tation.</P>
<P>In &s;hall make only this one remark more upon the &s;econd thing ob&s;ervable in our text; <HI>That we may often find rea&s;on to mourn for the lo&s;s of the&s;e per|&s;ons when they are dead, who were not ju&s;tly valued and well treated while they lived.</HI> Mourning for the dead was always accounted honourable: And here they mourn for <HI>Aaron</HI> thirty days, when they had di&s;honoured him by rebelling again&s;t him forty Years. And 'tis the lot of many of the &s;ervants of GOD, to have more honour after their death than in their life, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Ain&s;worth.</HI> In like manner Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> notes upon the place: and with his words I &s;hall conclude this head. "Twas a debt owing to their high-prie&s;t to <HI>mourn for him.</HI> While he lived they were <HI>murmuring,</HI> at him upon all occa&s;ions; but now he was dead, they mourned for him. Thus many are taught to lament the lo&s;s of tho&s;e mercies, which they would not learn to be thankful for the enjoy|ment of. Many good men have had more honour done to their memories than ever they had to their per&s;ons; witne&s;s tho&s;e who were per&s;ecuted while they lived, but when they were dead had their &s;epulchres garni&s;hed". Thus <HI>the congregation mourned for</HI> Aaron <HI>thirty days.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. BUT the third thing to be ob&s;erved in our text is, That <HI>all the congregation, even all the hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>mourned thus for</HI> Aaron. 'Twas common for <HI>all the congregation</HI> to mourn for the death of pub|lic per&s;ons; even <HI>all the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael,</HI> women as well as men, and per&s;on of every rank &amp; condition <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dru&s;</HI> &amp; <HI>Ain&s;w.</HI> in loc.</NOTE>.
<PB N="14" REF="003031_0016_0FEFAFC502B5F070">When the LORD of ho&s;ts took away from His people the <HI>mighty mand and the man of war,</HI> men who were as the &s;hields of the earth, the guards upon their va|luable intere&s;ts; or the <HI>judge</HI> and the <HI>prophet,</HI> men who were as gods upon earth to in&s;truct the world, to maintain peace and order, and execute ju&s;tice among men: it has been thought a proper time for general lamentation. In 2 Sam. 3.31, 32. we read that upon the death of <HI>Abner,</HI> a mighty man of war, <HI>David</HI> &s;aid to all the people, <HI>Rent your cloaths and gird you with &s;ackcloth, and mourn before</HI> Ab|ner. <HI>And king</HI> David <HI>him&s;elf followed the bier. And they buried</HI> Abner <HI>in</HI> Hebron: <HI>and the king lift up his voice, and wept at the grave of</HI> Abner; <HI>and all the people wept.</HI> And upon the death of <HI>Samuel</HI> that PROPHET of the LORD, who JUDGED <HI>I&s;rael</HI> all the days of his life, we read 1 Sam. 23.1. That <HI>all the I&s;raelites were gathered together, and lamented him.</HI> So <HI>Aaron</HI> being a man of a <HI>public character,</HI> and one that <HI>adorned</HI> the eminent &s;tation which GOD &s;et him in; we find that <HI>all the congregation,</HI> even <HI>all the Hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>mourned</HI> for him.</P>
<P>AND this one remark may be made upon it, <HI>That the death of eminent, holy and u&s;eful mini|&s;ters in the church of</HI> GOD <HI>is a public lo&s;s, and calls for general and public lamentation.</HI></P>
<P>FOR SUCH men, while they live, are an honour &amp; or|nament to their country. They not only reflect honour upon men who are of the &s;ame character and profe&s;&s;ion with them&s;elves: but they gain credit and reputation to the whole land. They recommend them&s;elves to &s;trangers, who will give them&s;elves an opportunity to be well acquainted with them; and are &s;erviceable to procure a good name abroad for the places where they live, and for the whole people among whom they &s;hine as lights in the world. So that in the death of &s;uch Per&s;ons a people may &s;ee a con&s;iderable part of <HI>glory departing:</HI> which will
<PB N="15" REF="003031_0017_0FEFAFC770E83F98">be e&s;teemed a ju&s;t ground of public and general la|mentation by all, excepting only &s;uch as are wholly de&s;titute of that &s;hining virtue, <HI>The love of ones country;</HI> without which men de&s;erve to be denied all the benefit of humane Society.</P>
<P>AND 'tis matter of general and public grief and mourning, that the churches of GOD are bereaved of the pre&s;ence and u&s;e of &s;uch men. Nor may we think it po&s;&s;ible for any to refrain from mourning on the death of eminent holy and u&s;eful mini&s;ters, who place any part of the beauty and glory of a country in-it's eccle&s;ia&s;tical and religious intere&s;ts: which, as far as they are agreable to the <HI>divine in&s;titutions,</HI> are indeed the great beauty and glory of any country; and u&s;ed to be more generally e&s;teemed as the glory of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER by taking away &s;uch men GOD gives us rea&s;on to fear approaching judgments: and this further evidences it to be matter of general and pub|lic lamentatation. For ought we know, &s;uch eminent men are taken away in order to &s;ome public evil, which will come &s;ooner when they are gone. The &s;maller the number of &s;uch men among a people, will they not the &s;ooner fill up the mea&s;ure of their ini|quities? Such men have great influence with heaven to avert the tokens of divine di&s;plea&s;ure. Like <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> they will not let GOD alone, that he may con&s;ume a people. We may fear therefore that when GOD is calling them from us by death, 'tis to make way for the execution of His judgments. When <HI>Eli&s;ah</HI> was taken away in a very evil age, <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> cri|ed out, <HI>My father, my father, the chariot of I&s;rael, and the hor&s;emen thereof!</HI> &mdash;"What will become of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> now thou art gone"! And where a people are not called to entertain &s;uch dark apprehen&s;ions from the death of any one great and good man among them; yet there is never any one &s;uch death, which doth not weaken and expo&s;e them: much more doth many &s;uch, within a &s;hort &s;pace of time, lay afe undation
<PB N="16" REF="003031_0018_0FEFAFC96F8684E8">for the mo&s;t unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions among a &s;inful people. How often has GOD's calling up His &s;er|vants into their chambers of re&s;t been the &s;ad prog|no&s;tic, that the divine indignation was ju&s;t breaking out again&s;t a people? If the righteous peri&s;h, and no man layeth it to heart; is it not a &s;ign, that they are taken away from evil to come? When GOD there|fore is taking away eminent, holy, and u&s;eful mini|&s;ters we &s;hould think our &s;elves called to mourn for it, with general and public lamentation.</P>
<P>THUS the &s;everal things ob&s;ervable in our text have been briefly con&s;idered. We &s;ee, That as the mo&s;t eminent of GOD's mini&s;ters dy, and are called up from us, 'tis our duty to mourn for them; and why the death of &s;uch men gives ju&s;t occa&s;ion for public and general lamentation.</P>
<P>AND now <HI>from the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e we may learn, what rea&s;on the people of GOD in this land have to mourn before Him.</HI></P>
<P>FOR among the various judgments inflicted for our &s;ins, what breaches doth he make in the wall of &s;afety round about us, by taking away men of great worth and &s;ervice, not only of the civil but &s;acred character? And e&s;pecially if we view the eccle&s;ia&s;tical order, the breach he hath made upon it, is great like the &s;ea; by the removal of our &s;piritual fathers from us, one after another: men of &s;uperiour rank and character for age and experience, learning, reputation, piety, wi&s;|dom, fidelity and u&s;efulne&s;s in the &s;acred calling.</P>
<P>WITHIN a few months pa&s;t, we have been called to lament the deaths of two &s;uch aged &s;ervants of the LORD <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The Rev Mr. <HI>Samuel Danforth</HI> of <HI>Taunton,</HI> who died <HI>Novemb.</HI> 14. And my honoured father-in-law the Rev. Mr. <HI>Peter Thacher</HI> of <HI>Milton,</HI> who died <HI>Dec.</HI> 17.1727.</NOTE>: while the days of mourning were &s;carce
<PB N="17" REF="003031_0019_0FEFAFCC10BB0CF0">over, for the breach He had made upon the &s;acred or|der in this town, by the death of a truly pious and faithful mini&s;ter <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">My dearly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> friend <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>William Waldro</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE>, in the mid&s;t of his days and u&s;e|fulne&s;s. And now it has plea&s;ed Heaven once again to break open the fountain of our grief: for we are now called to take a more &s;pecial notice of the oc|ca&s;ion which we have to mourn before GOD, in the death of the very reverend Dr. COTTON MATHER, our faithful and beloved pa&s;tor, who in the &s;overeign wi&s;e and holy providence of our LORD, is called up from us.</P>
<P>I own that a little mode&s;ty will forbid me to at|tempt an exact character of &s;o great a man. But piety towards GOD obliges every one of us to have a proper &s;en&s;e of the uncommon lo&s;s we have &s;u&s;|tained, that after a &s;uitable manner we may humble our&s;elves and mourn for the frown of Heaven in this di&s;pen&s;ation: while my character and relation to this beloved flock of CHRIST infer the &s;tronge&s;t bonds upon me, to endeavour that you may have ju&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions from divine providences; and at the &s;ame time, a concern for the honour of CHRIST, and a principle of love and gratitude to His decea&s;ed &s;ervant, with whom for &s;ome years I have been called to &s;erve as a &s;on in the go&s;pel, are powerfully working in my brea&s;t, as incentives to act up to my duty upon this mournful occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT will therefore be expected, that in repre&s;enting to you the providence of GOD, which calls aloud upon us to mourn this day, I &s;hould con&s;ider it, as it affects others be&s;ides our &s;elves; and demands the general and public lamentation of all the land. For in this death of one who made &s;o bright an appear|ance among the excellent of the earth, the whole
<PB N="18" REF="003031_0020_0FEFAFCF3545D528">land has lo&s;t a very con&s;iderable part of it's &s;trength and glory. Truth and ju&s;tice have lo&s;t a champion, who was able to defend and maintain them: Learn|ing hath lo&s;t an eminent patron, who was ever ready to promote it: The churches have lo&s;t a pa&s;tor, who was a pillar in the hou&s;e of his GOD. Now men of &s;uch a character with &s;trength and courage &s;tand in the gap, to keep off judgments; and, by lifting up of hands in faith and prayer, are prevalent with the LORD again&s;t the enemies of His people: They mu&s;t therefore be always acknowledged, as the orna|ments of our country, and the &s;trength &amp; defence of it too: like the chariots of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and the hor&s;emen thereof, who&s;e &s;piritual weapons are mighty thro' GOD. And without any further rea&s;oning upon the point, will not this be thought &s;ufficient to put the congregation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> even our whole land, into mourning for the death of &s;uch a great and good man, who was &s;et for the defence of our deare&s;t in|tere&s;ts, civil and &s;acred?</P>
<P>BUT then what abundant rea&s;on have all in the &s;ame &s;acred office to mourn and lament the lo&s;s we have &s;u&s;tained? If &s;ome few have lo&s;t a brother, the mo&s;t of us by far have lo&s;t a ma&s;ter and a father, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tence, incouragement, and coun&s;el were always with plea&s;ure afforded, in the weightie&s;t ca&s;es of doctrine and of di&s;cipline. He was a bright orna|ment and &s;ingular honour to the mini&s;terial order and profe&s;&s;ion: &s;hining as an in&s;tance and pattern of na|tural acquired and gracious endowments. The ca|pacity of his mind; the readine&s;s of his wit; the va&s;t|ne&s;s of his reading; the &s;trength of his memory; the variety and trea&s;ure of his learning, in printed works, and in manu&s;cripts which contain a much greater &s;hare; the &s;plendour of virtues, which, from the abundant grace of GOD with him, &s;hone out is the con&s;tant tenor of a mo&s;t entertaining and profitable conver&s;ation; his uncommon activity in the &s;ervice of CHRIST; his unwearied application to all the diffe|rent exerci&s;es of the pa&s;toral function; his exten&s;ive
<PB N="19" REF="003031_0021_0FEFAFD1CD6E2028">zeal and numberle&s;s projections to do good on all occa&s;ions: the&s;e things, as they were united in him, proclaimed him to be truly an extraordinary per&s;on; and united to make it difficult to find his equal, among men of like pa&s;&s;ions with us. He was pious, but not affected; &s;erious without moro&s;ene&s;s; grave, but not au&s;tere; affable without meanne&s;s; and facetious with|out levity. He was peaceable in his temper: but zealous again&s;t &s;in. He was a &s;trenuous nonconfor|mi&s;t to unin&s;tituted ceremonies impo&s;ed upon con|&s;cience, as terms of communion among &s;aints; which he con&s;idered as violations of chri&s;tian liberty, and &s;nares to the &s;ouls of men: He &s;trictly adhered to congregational principles of church-order and govern|ment; which he tho't mo&s;t agreable to the rule of GOD's word, the laws of &s;ociety, and the rights of mankind: He was a vigorous defender of the refor|med doctrines of grace, and of the my&s;teries of revea|led religion; which he ever regarded as the excelling glory of the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation: And yet he was catholick in his charity to all good men, tho' differ|ing from him in circum&s;tantials and modalities; de&s;i|rous to have churches re&s;emble the kingdom of Hea|ven; willing to receive all men, as CHRIST receives us to the glory of GOD; and pleading for no terms of communion among &s;aints, but the terms of &s;alva|tion. He was abundant in liberality to the poor, both for &s;oul and body; but careful to di&s;tingui&s;h the pro|per objects of it: and obliging to &s;trangers, tho' often ill-required.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the &s;hining parts of his cha|racter: which made him an honour and ornament to the &s;acred office among us; and render his death &s;o great a lo&s;s, to all whom he hath left behind him in it. And the&s;e things do likewi&s;e con&s;train all that knew him to mourn for his removal from us: if they have any pretence to re&s;emble him; as a &s;cholar, a divine, a chri&s;tian, or a gentleman.</P>

THUS religion and humanity are con&s;piring to force a &s;igh or a tear, from all that do not &s;o far live beneath the dictates of rea&s;on and con&s;cience, as to render their mo&s;t favourable regards for any, but the blemi&s;hes and wounds of honour &amp; reputation. And could I imagine, that any in this a&s;&s;embly belong to that herd of abandoned mortals, who&s;e &s;port it has been to reek their venom upon a faithful &s;ervant of GOD, in profane and ungodly &s;corn and deri&s;ion; I would, in compa&s;&s;ion to their poor &s;ouls, turn my di&s;|cour&s;e to them and &s;ay,&mdash;Mourn, O for&s;aken wretches, mourn at length the death of that &s;aint, who endea|voured, by his holy exhortations and fervent prayers, to keep you from the damnation of hell fire, and turn you to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t; while he lived above the reach of your envy and malice, and, in imi|tation of his great ma&s;ter JESUS CHRIST, was grie|ved for the hardne&s;s of your hearts.

<P>BUT that which mo&s;t nearly concerns me at pre|&s;ent is, to per&s;wade you of this church &amp; congrega|tion duely to humble your &s;elves and mourn under the mighty hand of GOD; that in due time He may exalt you.

<P>I am well a&s;&s;ured, you have not only been over|born with an ea&s;y tho' &s;trong conviction of the cer|tain truth of all the&s;e particulars, as we pa&s;&s;ed over them: but could ea&s;ily of your &s;elves enlarge upon them all.

<P>MOURN for your <HI>lo&s;s.</HI> And how great a lo&s;s have you &s;u&s;tained in &s;uch a death as this! So great and heavy, that mourning is the be&s;t de&s;cription of it: mourning not for him who has been called up from you; but for your &s;elves and for your children who are left behind. Doubtle&s;s, if your decea&s;ed pa&s;tor could now &s;peak to you, it would be in thole words of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour to the daughters of <HI>Jeru&s;alem, weep not for me, but weep for your &s;elves, and for your children</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> 23.28.</NOTE> GOD is now &s;aying, your eyes &s;hall &s;ee your teacher no more, and the places that have known him &s;hall know him no more: you &s;hall no more hear his plea&s;ant voice, in doctrine for your

<P>BUT then <HI>mourn</HI> for the <HI>&s;ins</HI> which may have occa&s;ioned this affliction and frown of Heaven upon you. For as our &s;ins do often hinder good things coming to us: &s;o they often provoke GOD to take away His ble&s;&s;ings from us: when therefore He is taking away mercies, it becomes us to con&s;ider whe|ther we have not been &s;inning again&s;t mercies. And there are &s;ins again&s;t eminent, boly, and u&s;eful mi|ni&s;ters, which may provoke GOD to take them away from a people: as when they are overvalued, and &s;et in GOD's &s;tead, or when they are too lightly e&s;teemed, and the earthen ve&s;&s;els are de&s;pi&s;ed, tho' there is much trea&s;ure in them; or when a people are un|thankful and unfruitful, barren and unprofitable under their enlightening, awakening, &amp; powerful mini&s;try: when they who are in a &s;tate and cour&s;e of &s;in, will not repent and reform; and when they who profe&s;s more religion continue cold, formal, indevout, and will not be quickened. Now then is a time for us to con&s;ider what &s;ins of ours may have provoked GOD, and to make them the matter of our mourning and lamentation before Him. Let us now think &s;e|riou&s;ly with our &s;elves, whether we may not take up the lamentation of the church and &s;ay, <HI>The crow is fallen from our head; wo unto us, that we have &s;inned.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lam.</HI> 5.15.</NOTE></P>

And when &s;uch a breach is made upon us, do we not lie open to other evils, which (if GOD prevent not) will ru&s;h in upon us, like a flood? This is a con&s;ideration which further calls for our mourning before the LORD: e&s;pecially when our decea&s;ed pa&s;tor expre&s;&s;ed his tender concern for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> this very regard; during his la&s;t agonies.

He was an in&s;trument of &s;piritual good to me, in his mini&s;try, from my early days; and very much a&s;&s;i&s;ted and directed my youthful &s;tudies: He excited me to publick &s;ervice in the mini&s;try; and accepted me to &s;erve with him, as a &s;on in the go&s;pel: He bore with my infirmities; and helped me under difficulties: He quickened me to my work; and &s;hewed me an example: He in|&s;tructed, admoni&s;hed, and exhorted me as a father; while by his conde&s;cending goodne&s;s he rai&s;ed me to the level of a friend and a brother. And as I truly loved him from my early childhood: &s;o I loved to honour him in &s;uitable acknowledgments of his excellencies and my obligations; till death has parted us. But this love has been made &s;tronger by death:
<PB N="25" REF="003031_0027_0FEFAFE14F27BAF0">for what I beheld in his la&s;t Sickne&s;s and dying hours, has rai&s;ed my affections higher than ever; and I value the ble&s;&s;ing in the want of it, even more than in the enjoyment.</P>
<P>FROM the beginning of his confinement, he di&s;|covered a &s;trong per&s;wa&s;ion that it would prove his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s: but he had not left the great work of preparation for death to &s;uch a time.

<HEAD>A SPEECH of the Rev. Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> to &s;ome of his church &amp; neighbours, when under threat|ning &s;ickne&s;s; penned down by one of them immedi|ately afterwards</HEAD>
<P>I am &s;ingularly advantaged in two or three re&s;pects r. I have learned to e&s;teem patience under &s;ickne&s;s, to be better than health it &s;elf. 2. I am &s;ure my &s;ins which have been many and mighty are all par|doned, for the &s;ake of the &s;acrifice of CHRIST. I am &s;ure CHRIST's blood has been applied to me, be|cau&s;e of it's purifying efficacy on me; and that His death has been for me, becau&s;e I live unto GOD. 3. I am, thro' the grace of CHRIST, got above the fear of death: I am a conqueror, yea more than a conqueror over that king of terrors: and if I was a&s;|&s;ured, I &s;hould dy this very night, I could entertain death as the be&s;t friend I ever met withal. And then as to the things which men generally trouble them|&s;elves about, as worldly e&s;tate, children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I can leave all in the hands of a dear SAVIOUR, who&s;e watchful providence will graciou&s;ly take care of them-&mdash; And this happy frame I a&s;cribe to my having conver&s;ed much with a glorious CHRIST, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I &s;peak not this in the lea&s;t from any proud or vain|glorious tho'ts: but to let you know, that the prin|ciples I have &s;o often in&s;i&s;ted on in my mini&s;try, will &s;upport a man under the apprehen&s;ions of death. When a friend at parting &s;aid, <HI>I hope it will be but a light affliction;</HI> he replied, <HI>I know it will work for me a far more exceeding and an eternal weight of glory.</HI></P>
<P>A few days after, he &s;aid to one of the &s;ame per&s;ons, &mdash; I have in this time of &s;ickne&s;s been often exa|mining into my de&s;ires of life. The mo&s;t men de&s;ire to live, either, 1. Becau&s;e they are afraid to dy: but now that will never do. What! after &s;o many years under &s;uch rich advantages, and be afraid to dy! By no means. But, I ble&s;s GOD, <HI>that</HI> point thro' our LORD JESUS CHRIST is well provided for. Or, 2. Becau&s;e they have &s;uch a &s;trong affection to, and delight in creature-comforts: but now this will not do neither. What! be loth to leave &s;treams, and go to the fountain! What! love the creatures more than the Creator, in whom all good is originally and tran&s;cendently! The only plea then is, <HI>My advantages to do good:</HI> I am in working ca&s;e, and may, by GOD's ble&s;&s;ing, be in&s;trumental to bring &s;ome &s;mall honours to GOD's name: and whenever GOD &s;hall plea&s;e to put an end to this, I am re&s;ign'd; &amp; have no more to &s;ay, but wait His good plea&s;ure.</P>

<P>WHEN he fir&s;t perceived the &s;troke of death, he expre&s;&s;ed much &s;atisfaction and tranquillity; and with an undaunted voice &s;aid, <HI>I know whom I have be|lieved, and I am per&s;uaded that he can, and will keep that which I have committed to him.</HI> When &s;omething was applied to cool his eyes, which were inflamed by his fever, he &s;aid, <HI>In a little time all tears will be wiped from my eyes.</HI> When &s;omething was offered to quench his thir&s;t, he &s;aid, <HI>I am going to drink of tho&s;e rivers of delight, which flow from the throne of GOD, and of THE LAMB.</HI> When the phy&s;icians intimated to him, that there was now no pro&s;pect of his life, he li&s;ted up his hands and eyes, and with a particular pathos &s;aid, <HI>Thy will be done

<PB N="30" REF="003031_0032_0FEF96FD8A59AC68">apprehended him to be in the mo&s;t painful agonies, he &s;aid, with a &s;ort of triumph in his air &amp; accent, <Q>And is this dying! This all! Is this what I feared when I prayed again&s;t a hard death! Is it no more than this! O I can bear this! I can bear it, I can bear it!</Q></P>
<P>THIS la&s;t pa&s;&s;age leads me to mention it, that from the &s;trong reluctances of nature again&s;t the bitter cup of a very painful death which had been given to &s;everal of his venerable ance&s;tors, and pa&s;&s;ed down from them to diver&s;e of his fathers gracious children, he was often heard to deprecate it, in the time of his health. And with what earne&s;tne&s;s he has cryed to GOD in this place <HI>for an ea&s;y death &mdash; for an ea&s;y death &mdash; for an ea&s;y death,</HI> with &s;uch a repetition of the cry, many of you here pre&s;ent are the witne&s;&s;es. But he was graciou&s;ly heard, in that which he feared; and when it was ob&s;erved to him, that GOD had heard his prayers for an <HI>ea&s;y death,</HI> I think his an&s;wer was in this one word, <HI>Grace!</HI> the la&s;t word, as I remem|ber, that he was heard to &s;peak.</P>
<P>THUS was he kept in perfect peace, with a mind &s;tayed upon his GOD and SAVIOUR: till he lifted up his eyes towards heaven; and &s;weetly re&s;ign'd his &s;pirit into the hands of JESUS, without a &s;truggle or a groan. Lord, may we thus die the death of the righteous, and our latter end be like his!</P>
<P>AND I cannot forbear &s;aying here, that I was never &s;o affected with a view of the hope which the righteous have in their death, and the peace which is the latter end of the upright, as when I &s;aw them in the la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s and dying hours of this &s;ervant of GOD. To behold a &s;aint with all the tokens of a divine calm in his brea&s;t, not only daring to encoun|ter the king of terrors, but ri&s;ing above all fears into joyful views of immortality; and in &s;uch a frame giving the exacte&s;t orders and directions to all about him, according to their &s;everal characters and relations, that they al&s;o may be over-comers and win a never-fading crown in the kingdom of heaven: This is a
<PB N="31" REF="003031_0033_0FEFAFEE8C34B9B0">&s;pectacle inconceivably greater and more glorious, than a bold and venturous hero in a <HI>campaign,</HI> who fearle&s;s and un&s;haken exactly directs the battle, when invironed with fire and death. O how much greater is it, to &s;ee a humble &s;inner, through the grace of CHRIST po&s;&s;e&s;t with a full per&s;wa&s;ion of the favour of GOD, biding adieu to all the charms of this world, encountring a death di&s;armed by the redeemer, look|ing after all the inconceivable glories of the heavenly world, and expre&s;&s;ing a divine concern for the eternal happine&s;s of others: How much greater, I &s;ay, is this, than to &s;ee a guilty creature, for the fading honours of this life, ru&s;h into all the hazzards of future mi&s;ery, when GOD and JESUS are not in all his thoughts, and thou&s;ands of immortal &s;ouls are made the tools of his ambition! But as great a &s;pectacle as this is, the religion of JESUS has often produced it; and, we may &s;peak it to the glory of the free grace of GOD, we have &s;een it in the death of our pa&s;ter.</P>
<P>Now then, beloved, you may well think how much I feel, (may GOD keep me from &s;inking under) the lo&s;s of &s;uch a father and &s;uch a friend. I freely join my griefs to yours, to make up the mourning that heaven calls us to this day: and I de&s;ire to join with you in all the &s;entiments, tempers, re&s;olutions, and actions, whereby GOD may be glorified upon this occa&s;ion. O that our forrowing and mourning may be after a godly &s;ort; from holy principles, and for religious ends! O that we may be deeply humbled under the mighty hand of GOD, and lay our &s;elves low at His feet; under a &s;en&s;e of our &s;ins and pro|vocations, and of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure! O that while we thus humble our &s;elves, we may by faith repair to the great &s;acrifice for the prie&s;t-hood and for the con|gregation, and repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes! O that we may hold on crying mightily to GOD, for his pardoning mercy, &s;anctifying grace, and comforting &s;pirit!

And as in His holy providence deep calleth unto deep, his billows are rowling over you, and you have &s;orrow upon &s;orrow: now remember, it has plea&s;ed the FATHER that all fulne&s;s &s;hould dwell in CHRIST, as the head of His people in His covenant; of who&s;e fullne&s;s you may receive, and grace for grace.</P>
<P>WE wi&s;h that you who have lo&s;t an excellent <HI>parent,</HI> may by happy experience find, that when your father for&s;akes you, the LORD will take you up. With Him the fatherle&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> mercy: and

While you chu&s;e their GOD for your GOD, &amp; follow them as they followed CHRIST, you will be a worthy &s;on of &s;uch a father; and be made a ble&s;&s;ing, like him, in the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel, which you are entred into with peculiar advantages.</P>
<P>MAY &s;uch as are bereaved of an excellent <HI>brother,</HI> take comfort in the tho't of this: that our LORD JESUS CHRIST doth mo&s;t graciou&s;ly invite their con&s;ideration of Him, as their <HI>elder brother;</HI> and that He is <HI>the re&s;urrection and the life.</HI></P>
<P>MAY all the bereaved hear an al&s;ufficient GOD &s;aying to them, <HI>I will never leave you, nor for&s;ake you.</HI> May His everla&s;ting arms be underneath them to &s;upport them: and as their affliction abounds, may the con&s;olations which are not &s;mall abound likewi&s;e thro' CHRIST JESUS; who can give the oil of joy for mourning, and the garments of prai&s;e for the &s;pirit of heavine&s;s.</P>
<P>AND now may we all pre&s;s after &s;uch a lively ex|erci&s;e of &s;trong faith in the wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, and faithfulne&s;s of GOD thro' our LORD JESUS CHRIST, as will enable us to glorify Him; by the mo&s;t be|coming re&s;ignation to His will, under all the chan|ges that come upon us. In this we &s;hall take the mo&s;t effectual method, to have our mourning turned into joy.</P>

WHEN the excellencies of creatures might no lon|ger comfort us, the decea&s;ed &s;ervant of GOD would always lead us to CHRIST the fountain of them all; thro' whom we may &s;ay, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the LORD,</HI> when He taketh away, as well as when He giveth. And whither &s;hould we go, but to the fountain, when &s;treams are dried up?</P>
<P>Now therefore let us remember, how we have received and heard: and while we are bewailing our lo&s;s, let us realize it, that all the excellencies which rendred our pa&s;tor &s;o dear to us, were but a little &s;tream (and to the glory of the divine fulne&s;s we may &s;ay, but a little drop) from the infinite and overflowing fountain of all good in CHRIST JESUS. <HI>Then,</HI> if our mourning this day be from a godly &s;orrow that worketh repentance, we may &s;ee what grounds we have to hope in Him, with whom is the re&s;idue of the &s;pirit; that He will thru&s;t forth labourers into His harve&s;t, and maintain a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of them who &s;hall be the ble&s;&s;ed in&s;truments of building up His kingdom among us: and <HI>then,</HI> whoever is taken from us by death, we may comfort our&s;elves, and glorify Him by &s;inging that &s;ong, <HI>The LORD liveth: and ble&s;&s;ed be my rock: and exalted be the GOD of the rock of my &s;alvation.</HI></P>
