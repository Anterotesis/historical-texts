<P>AND he &s;aid unto them, go ye into all the World, and preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SALVATION being a matter of the greate&s;t im|portance to men, it certainly concerns them to be well &s;atisfied (if &s;uch &s;atisfaction can be ob|tained) what is the condition of their being &s;aved; or what are the terms on which forgivene&s;s of &s;in, and eter|nal life, are offered to them by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And altho' &s;ome have differed greatly about the&s;e, yet, &s;uch difference, cannot, I apprehend, be ju&s;tly owing to any ob&s;curity, re&s;pecting this affair, in the word of God, but mu&s;t have had its ri&s;e from other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>It cannot be ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed, but that the infinitely wi&s;e and good God, would make a matter of &s;uch general concernment, and of &s;uch high importance to every one, &s;o clear and plain, as that the weak and le&s;s intelligent, as well as others, &s;hould be able, with due attention and care, to form a proper judgment, and not be liable to any fatal mi&s;takes.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="011506_0004_0F853A63144E7898">And our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, in the words I have now read (which contain a &s;olemn charge to his apo&s;tles, who were to be the fir&s;t publi&s;hers and preachers of the Go&s;pel) has declared in the plaine&s;t manner; and in a manner, as I conceive, perfectly agreeable to the general tenor of the Go&s;pel, what is the condition of &s;alvation; &mdash;what are the qualifications required of every one, who enjoys the Go&s;pel, nece&s;&s;ary to their being &s;aved:&mdash;of which qualifications, being the real &s;ubjects, they &s;hall undoubt|edly obtain happine&s;s; but without which, they cannot ra|tionally hope for this, but may expect to peri&s;h in their &s;ins.</P>
<P>Several things worthy of &s;pecial notice, might be ju&s;tly con&s;idered from the text;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Two other Di&s;cour&s;es be&s;ides this, were preached to my own People, upon this Text.</NOTE> but what I de&s;ign, in the pre|&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e is, to &s;et before you, in as plain and intelli|gible a manner as I can, the condition of &s;alvation, as this is here pointed out to us. And this I take to be A BELIEF OF THE GOSPEL, with A PROFESSED and PRACTICAL REGARD to IT.</P>
<P>&mdash;<HI>Preach the Go&s;pel to every creature. He that believeth</HI> &mdash;beliveth what? The Go&s;pel which is preached to him &mdash;<HI>He that believeth</HI> (THIS) <HI>and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI>&mdash;And, that hereby is intended, not only "a belief of the Go&s;pel," but al&s;o "a profe&s;&s;ed and practical regard to it," will appear with &s;ufficient evidence, by con&s;idering</P>
<P>FIRST, the de&s;ign and intention of Bapti&s;m, as to believers. And,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, by comparing &s;everal of the Evangeli&s;ts together, re&s;pecting the &s;ubject in the text.</P>
<P>FIRST. Let us con&s;ider the de&s;ign and intention of chri&s;tain Bapti&s;m, as to believers.</P>
<P>And it &s;eems manife&s;t, from the &s;cripture account of Bapti&s;m, that one main intention of adult per&s;ons &s;ub|miting to that rite, was an open, public profe&s;&s;ion, or declaration of their faith in Chri&s;t, or his Go&s;pel: &mdash;their profe&s;&s;edly receiving him for their divine ma&s;ter &amp; lord, and declaring them&s;elves his di&s;ciples and followers.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="011506_0005_0F853A638D940748">As a public &s;ign, it was equivalent to their making, with their mouth, and openly before the world, a profe&s;|&s;ion of the chri&s;tain religion;&mdash;of their belief of its doctrines;&mdash;of their repenting of, and renouncing their &s;ins;&mdash;of their re&s;olutions to live agreeable to the &s;acred rules of the Go&s;pel; and, in that way, to &s;eek &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. In a word; it was their vi&s;ible, and public admi&s;&s;ion into the chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>Agreeably we are thus informed, that upon Peter's preaching the Go&s;pel to a great multitude&mdash;<HI>They that gladly received his word were baptized; and the &s;ame day there were added unto them,</HI> i. e. to the di&s;ciples,&mdash; to the church of Chri&s;t, <HI>about three thou&s;and &s;ouls;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 41.</NOTE> con|cerning whom it immediately follows, that&mdash;<HI>they conti|nued &s;teadfa&s;tly in the apo&s;tles doctrine, and fellow&s;hip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</HI> Thus, by &s;ubmiting to that &s;acred rite, they became profe&s;&s;edly the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, and joined in communion and fellow|&s;hip with the apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>And that per&s;ons bapti&s;m was thus, by an apt and proper &s;ign, their profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tanity and of their di&s;ciple&s;hip to Je&s;us, &s;eems evident from Paul's words, where he reproves the Corinthians for their divi&s;ions; and &s;aying, one and another, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 13.</NOTE> <HI>I am of Paul, and I of Apollos,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Is Chri&s;t divided?</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</HI> They were baptized in the name of Chri&s;t; not of Paul, nor Apollos, nor Cephas; and ought therefore to have called them&s;elves only after him. Their bapti&s;m, in his name, was a profe&s;&s;ion of their faith in him, as crucified for them, and of their being his di&s;ciples and followers.</P>
<P>To the like purpo&s;e are the&s;e words of the &s;ame apo&s;|tle to the Galatians&mdash;<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal, iii. 27.</NOTE> <HI>As many of you as have been baptized into Chri&s;t, have put on Chri&s;t.</HI> i. e. ye have profe&s;&s;edly put on his religion:&mdash;ye have declared your|&s;elves his di&s;ciples, and engaged to live according to his doctrines. For, that the phra&s;e, <HI>putting on Chri&s;t,</HI> is &s;ig|nificative of per&s;ons &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and obedience to him, as
<PB N="8" REF="011506_0006_0F853A643B41E818">
their divine ma&s;ter and lord;&mdash;of their mortifying their corrupt lu&s;ts, and living in all holine&s;s, according to the Go&s;pel, appears from the apo&s;tle's exhortation in another place&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 13. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Let us walk hone&s;tly as in the day;</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>not in rioting and drunkenne&s;s; not in chambering and wantonne&s;s; not in &s;trife and envying: But put ye on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and make no provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h to fulfill the lu&s;ts thereof.</HI></P>
<P>When it is &s;aid therefore in the text, <HI>He that be|lieveth and is baptized &s;hall be &s;aved,</HI> by this we are not to under&s;tand &s;imply, a belief of the Go&s;pel, and &s;ubmit|ing to the rite of Bapti&s;m, but &s;uch a firm and operative belief of its doctrines, as leads a per&s;on readily and openly to declare him&s;elf a di&s;ciple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,&mdash;profe&s;&s;edly to repent of, and to for&s;ake his former &s;ins, and to devote him&s;elf to the practice of religion and godline&s;s, as taught and enjoined upon him by the Son of God.</P>
<P>So much as this, &s;eems to be fairly included in the text; and to be there meant, by a per&s;on's believing and being baptized, as nece&s;&s;ary to his being &s;aved. And that this practical regard to the Go&s;pel is included in the condition of &s;alvation, will farther appear, if now,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, We compare &s;everal of the Evangeli&s;ts together, with re&s;pect to this point.</P>
<P>Mark, as we have already taken notice, repre&s;ents Chri&s;t, when committing a &s;olemn charge to his Apo&s;tles, as the preachers of his Go&s;pel, as declaring this to be the condition of &s;alvation, viz. A belief of the Go&s;pel, with Bapti&s;m.&mdash;<HI>He that believeth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> Luke &s;peaks of this matter thus. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke xxiv. 46&punc; 47.</NOTE> <HI>And &s;aid un|to them</HI> (i.e. Chri&s;t &s;aid to his Apo&s;tles) <HI>Thus it is writ|ten, and thus it behoved Chri&s;t to &s;uffer, and to ri&s;e from the dead the third day: And that repentance and remi&s;|&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name, among all nations beginning at Jeru&s;alem.</HI> But, it cannot be ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed but that the&s;e two Evangeli&s;ts, when &s;peaking of the &s;ame time, and treating of the &s;ame &s;ubject, meant to &s;ay, in &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;ame thing; or to point out one
<PB N="9" REF="011506_0007_0F853A65011DC440">
and the &s;ame way to happine&s;s. For altho' Mark &s;peaks of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> as the condition of &s;alvation; and Luke expre&s;sly mentions neither of the&s;e, but &s;peaks on|ly of <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins,</HI> as to be preached in Chri&s;t's name <HI>among all nations,</HI> yet it is not at all nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e, but that they are perfectly agreed, in giving the &s;en&s;e and intention of our Saviour's words to them, and in pointing out the way to happine&s;s by him.</P>
<P>For, Repentance, as produced by the Go&s;pel, nece&s;&s;a|rily &s;uppo&s;es faith, and every other qualification of the real Chri&s;tian. No man, under the Go&s;pel, and as moved and influenced by it, truly repents of his &s;ins, without believing the Go&s;pel: Repentance is nece&s;&s;arily connec|ted with this Faith, as it proceeds from it.</P>
<P>And he that, upon believing the Go&s;pel, truly repents of his &s;ins, will readily comply with whatever the Go&s;pel requires of him: Becau&s;e repentance, as it implies real &s;orrow for his pa&s;t &s;ins, &s;o it &s;uppo&s;es he is now re&s;olved upon a better life:&mdash;As it implies his being really grieved for all pa&s;t di&s;obedience to God, &s;o it &s;uppo&s;es him to be now determined upon a ready and univer&s;al obedience to his will, &s;o far as he is acquainted with it: this is e&s;|&s;ential to the nature of true repentance.</P>
<P>The true penitent then, under the Go&s;pel, is the real Chri&s;tian:&mdash; One who is di&s;po&s;ed to comply with what|ever he &s;ees, and is convinced the Go&s;pel requires of him. Bapti&s;m therefore, as a rite of divine in&s;titution, he will readily &s;ubmit to, as a declaration of his faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t,&mdash;of his choice of him, under the character of a Saviour; and in acknowledgment of his being his di&s;ci|ple, and determined to live according to his &s;acred laws. Agreeably, to the convinced Jews, when they enquired of Peter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 38.</NOTE> <HI>what they &s;hould do</HI> (i. e. to be &s;aved) <HI>he &s;aid&mdash; repent ye and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> He that &s;incerely repents, will be ready to be baptized, i. e. he will be wil|ling to make profe&s;&s;ion of the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; &mdash;to appear as one of his di&s;ciples, and will aim at living
<PB N="10" REF="011506_0008_0F853A65C1DB5780">
agreeable to the holy rules and precepts of the Go&s;pel. And he that does this, will obtain the remi&s;&s;ion of his &s;ins, and eternal life.</P>
<P>To <HI>believe</HI> the Go&s;pel therefore, and to be <HI>baptized,</HI> in Mark, which is there made the condition of a per&s;on's being &s;aved, mu&s;t mean the &s;ame with <HI>repentance,</HI> in Luke, which is there the condition of the &s;ame ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; i. e. of the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and &s;o, of a per&s;on's being in favor with God, and an heir to happine&s;s through Chri&s;t: Or the&s;e qualifications, as the condition of &s;alvation, mutually imply each other. So that the&s;e two Evan|geli&s;ts, when declaring the mind of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, point out one and the &s;ame way to happine&s;s, viz. &s;uch a belief of the Go&s;pel as is productive of, and attended with, a &s;incere and hearty di&s;po&s;ition to obey it in all things. Matthew's account of this matter is &s;omewhat different from both the&s;e. He repre&s;ents Chri&s;t's charge to his Apo&s;tles in this manner&mdash;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxviii. 19, 20.</NOTE> <HI>Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Gho&s;t: teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever I have commanded you.</HI></P>
<P>But here we have the &s;ame Condition of Salvation; or the &s;ame qualifications, as before, are required in the &s;ubjects of it. For, a belief of the Go&s;pel is manife&s;tly here &s;uppo&s;ed, otherwi&s;e it would be ab&s;urd to imagine per&s;ons would be baptized. But then, be&s;ides their be|ing taught,&mdash;their believing the go&s;pel, and being bap|tized, they were <HI>to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever Chri&s;t had commanded.</HI> i. e. to yield a ready and univer&s;al obe|dience to the Go&s;pel. This mu&s;t imply repentance, as well as faith;&mdash;a for&s;aking of all former &s;ins, and a care|ful and con&s;ciencious di&s;charge of all chri&s;tain duties. Upon the whole therefore, we may ju&s;tly conclude, as I &s;aid at fir&s;t, that the condition of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t is this,&mdash;"A belief of the go&s;pel, with a profe&s;&s;ed and practical regard to it."</P>
<P>And this, we &s;hall find, if we properly attend to the Go&s;pel, is agreeable to the whole tenor of it. However
<PB N="11" REF="011506_0009_0F853A66829D5790">
&s;ome particular pa&s;&s;ages, taken ab&s;tractedly, may &s;eem to point out another way to heaven; and have been &s;ome|times mi&s;improved, and abu&s;ed to bad purpo&s;es in reli|gion, yet the Go&s;pel, viewed in the whole of it, and as containing one con&s;i&s;tent, harmonious &s;cheme of Reli|gion, abundantly declares this to be the condition of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, agreeable to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages from St. Paul, who well under&s;tood the Go&s;pel, and who &s;peaks of it under the character of the Grace of God&mdash; <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 11, and on.</NOTE> <HI>The Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath ap|peared to all men. Teaching us that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world; looking for the ble&s;&s;ed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t: who gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people zealous of good works.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>Improvement.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT has been offered upon the pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject may be of important u&s;e to us in &s;everal re&s;pects. It &s;hews us FIRST, that to believe in Chri&s;t, and to believe the Go&s;pel, mu&s;t mean the &s;ame thing; becau&s;e both are repre&s;ented, in different places, as the condi|tion of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>To believe the Go&s;pel is thus repre&s;ented in my text; and to believe in Chri&s;t, is often mentioned, in this manner, el&s;ewhere. Thus &s;aith our Saviour him&s;elf&mdash; <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">John iii. 16.</NOTE> <HI>God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth IN HIM &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life.</HI></P>
<P>And what is it to believe in Chri&s;t, but to believe the go&s;pel account of him?&mdash;that he is the Son of God? &mdash;that he is the Saviour of the world, &amp;c. He that believes in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the Go&s;pel reveals and repre|&s;ents him, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to believe in him under the character of a Saviour;&mdash;to receive his doctrines as di|vine truths;&mdash;to tru&s;t in him, as the great &s;acrifice of
<PB N="12" REF="011506_0010_0F853A674523DF48">
atonement for &s;in; and to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the govern|ment of his &s;acred laws. Without this, a man is not a true believer in Chri&s;t; or what Faith &s;oever he may have, it will be of no advantage, as to the important purpo&s;e of Salvation.</P>
<P>And is not this the character of him who believeth the Go&s;pel?&mdash;I mean, in a &s;aving &s;en&s;e. He believeth, and is baptized: i. e. openly profe&s;&s;eth the chri&s;tian religion;&mdash;acknowledges Je&s;us Chri&s;t for his Lord and Redeemer;&mdash;owns him&s;elf his di&s;ciple, and aims at living agreeable to his divine in&s;tructions and precepts.</P>
<P>So that, he who believes the Go&s;pel, or who believes in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;o as to be &s;aved, is no other than the real Chri&s;tian, who pays an hearty, practical regard to the Go&s;pel. He who does this will undoubtedly be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Groundle&s;s therefore, and to no purpo&s;e, unle&s;s to darken religion, and perplex the minds of Chri&s;tians, &s;eems to be what has been &s;ometimes &s;aid about Faith as ju&s;tifying and &s;aving: As that the particular act of faith which ju&s;tifies, has main re&s;pect to Chri&s;t, in his prie&s;tly office; or that it is a laying hold on Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s; or a relying upon his merits, &amp;c. Or again, That &s;aving Faith is a per&s;on's believing that Chri&s;t died for him in particular; and that his own &s;ins are forgiven for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and the like.</P>
<P>For, no one act of faith ju&s;tifies more than another, any farther than it has a religious or moral influence on the temper and life of the believer;&mdash;any farther than it leads him to repent of his &s;ins, and engages him in a practical regard to the Go&s;pel. He who has this faith, or who&s;e faith has this effect upon him, will, ac|cording to the Go&s;pel &s;cheme, have his &s;ins forgiven, be ju&s;tified and &s;aved. Not, indeed, on account of any particular act of faith, or any thing el&s;e, in him&s;elf, me|ritoriou&s;ly con&s;idered (for pardon and &s;alvation are of free, unmerited grace) but being thus qualified, God, of his rich and abundant mercy, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, will, according to the Go&s;pel, forgive his &s;ins, and grant him eternal life.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="011506_0011_0F853A68066B8E00">And how &s;trongly &s;oever any man may be per&s;uaded that Chri&s;t died for them in particular, and that their own &s;ins are forgiven for his &s;ake, if they have not a faith that purifies their hearts and lives from &s;in, and engages their obedience to the Go&s;pel, they are, un|doubtedly, in their hopes of happine&s;s, deceiving them|&s;elves with vain and groundle&s;s imaginations.</P>
<P>SECONDDY. By what has been offered upon the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, we may determine what we mu&s;t always under&s;tand by the words, <HI>faith</HI> or <HI>believing,</HI> when mentioned in &s;cripture, as the condition of &s;alvation. Hereby we are not to under&s;tand merely, or &s;imply, a belief of the Go&s;pel; but &s;uch a belief of it;&mdash;&s;uch a firm per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth and importance of the doctrines contained in it, as proves influencial on the temper and life, and engages the believer's practical regard to whatever the Go&s;pel requires.</P>
<P>It is true; faith and works, or faith and obedience, are, in their nature, clearly and &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other: and they are often &s;poken of by way of di&s;tinction from one another in the Go&s;pel. But then, as both the&s;e are manife&s;tly included in the Con|dition of &s;alvation, it is obvious, that when one of them, only, is mentioned, as &s;uch condition, the other mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to attend it, or be included in it.</P>
<P>Thus, when it was &s;aid, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. v. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Chri&s;t is the author of eternal &s;alvation to all them that obey him;</HI> by tho&s;e that obey him, we mu&s;t under&s;tand tho&s;e who <HI>believe</HI> as well as <HI>obey</HI> the go&s;pel; for, &s;uch obedience is the fruit and effect of faith, and cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed without it. So again; it is written&mdash;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;uppo&s;ed to be|lieve in Chri&s;t, or to believe the Go&s;pel, as a Revelation from God, as &s;uch faith is the very principle of this obedience to divine commandments.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="011506_0012_0F853A68D41743C8">And, on the other hand; when faith <HI>only</HI> or believing is &s;poken of as the condition, or grand requi&s;ite to &s;al|vation, &s;uch faith is to be under&s;tood in a large &s;en&s;e;&mdash; as the principle of good works; or as virtually including in it, obedience to the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>It is a faith, which, agreeable to what we have heard, involves with it, repentance of &s;in;&mdash;a ready profe&s;&s;ion of the chri&s;tian religion, and a practical regard to what|ever Chri&s;t has commanded.</P>
<P>Needle&s;s therefore, and without any ju&s;t foundation, &s;eems to be the di&s;tinction which &s;ome have made,&mdash;that, tho' obedience is nece&s;&s;ary to prove a man's faith to be true and genuine; and nece&s;&s;ary to his being finally &s;aved, yet faith <HI>alone</HI> ju&s;tifies, and puts him in favor with God. For, that faith which is &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify, mu&s;t, I con|ceive, if continued in, be &s;ufficient to &s;ave any man. For, what is his being ju&s;tified, but his having his &s;ins for|given;&mdash;his being judicially acquitted of guilt, and &s;o delivered from an obligation to puni&s;hment? And if a man is thus forgiven;&mdash;if his guilt is removed, and he is delivered from an obligation to puni&s;hment;&mdash;if he has a faith which entitles him to the&s;e privileges, or ble&s;&s;ings, will it not, if continued in, be &s;ufficient to &s;ave him? Will God condemn any whom he does not look upon as guilty; and puni&s;h any whom he forgives, and frees from obligation to puni&s;hment? It &s;hould &s;eem there|fore, either that a man may be &s;aved as well as ju&s;tified, without obedience to the Go&s;pel, or el&s;e that the faith by which he is ju&s;tified, mu&s;t virtually include &s;uch obe|dience in it.</P>
<P>But it is plain from the word of God, that repentance, and other acts of obedience to the Go&s;pel, are as really a condition, or are a part of the condition of per&s;ons being forgiven, or ju&s;tified, as faith it&s;elf is. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts iii. 19.</NOTE><HI>Repent ye&mdash;and be converted that your &s;ins may be blotted out</HI>&mdash;Is it not manife&s;t from this, that without repentance and conver|&s;ion their &s;ins would not be blotted out?

<P>Upon the whole then, we may ju&s;tly conclude, that <HI>faith</HI> or <HI>believing,</HI> as the condition of &s;alvation, compre|hends the whole of religion. Not faith, &s;imply con&s;idered, but faith with its proper effects and fruits;&mdash;as producing repentance, and a good life. And this is agreeable to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages from St. James (who, it may be pre&s;umed, was no more of an Arminian, or of any other kind of he|retick, than any man may &s;afely be.) <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James 2.24.26.</NOTE> <HI>Ye &s;ee then, how that by works a man is ju&s;tified and not by faith only&mdash; For as the body without the &s;pirit is dead, &s;o faith with|out works is dead al&s;o.</HI> Let it be our concern that we have this faith which is influencial and operative; and productive of that &s;incere and univer&s;al obedience to the Go&s;pel, which is nece&s;&s;ary to compleat the chri&s;tain's character, and to give a title to &s;alvation thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THIRDLY. The &s;ubject we have been upon, de&s;erves the particular and &s;erious con&s;ideration of all tho&s;e, who neglect a per&s;onal, public profe&s;&s;ion of the chri&s;tian re|ligion, and a practical regard to the whole of it.</P>
<P>Bapti&s;m, in a &s;tate of infancy, &s;eems, by no means, to come up to the intention of Bapti&s;m in the text. The Go&s;pel was preached to the adult, or to tho&s;e who were come to the exerci&s;e of rea&s;on; and not to infants who were incapable of under&s;tanding, and believing it. <HI>The&s;e,</HI> i. e. the adult, upon their believing, were <HI>baptized</HI>; which was a public profe&s;&s;ion of the chri&s;tian religion, or of their being the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Infants, we &s;uppo&s;e to have been, and no doubt were, baptized by the Apo&s;tles: But then, their Bapti&s;m was not in con&s;equence of their having believed, and &s;o a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> declaration of their faith and di&s;ciple&s;hip: But they were baptized as the children of believers;&mdash;their Bapti&s;m, under the Go&s;pel, &s;ucceeding in the place of circumc&s;iion, under the jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation. It was there|fore no per&s;onal act of their's,&mdash;neither is it now. I

cannot &s;ee therefore how &s;uch as continue in their infant &s;tate, as to Bapti&s;m, can &s;atify them&s;elves that they come up to what the Go&s;pel requires of them, as the condition of their being &s;aved.</P>
<P>True; They do not deny, or renounce their Bapti&s;m. But this &s;eems far from being &s;ufficient, to their &s;u&s;tain|ing the proper and compleat character of chri&s;tians; and indulging a well-grounded hope of &s;alvation. In order to this, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, that they &s;hould do &s;omething, equivalent, in the intention of it, to their &s;ubmitting to Bapti&s;m, as their <HI>own per&s;onal act</HI>: i. e. that they &s;hould per&s;onally and publickly recognize and own their Bap|ti&s;m, and acknowledge them&s;elves the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by an open profe&s;&s;ion of his religion, and a prac|tical regard to whatever he has commanded.</P>
<P>While they neglect this, and, in con&s;equence hereof, neglect another &s;pecial and expre&s;s ordinance of the Go&s;pel, viz. that of the Lord's Supper, how do they appear as Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples?&mdash;How do they do what&s;o|ever Chri&s;t has commanded them? And if they do not &s;o much as aim at this;&mdash;if they knowingly neglect what the Go&s;pel plainly requires of them, how can they &s;atisfy them&s;elves, that they comply with the condition of &s;alvation?</P>
<P>I would recommend the&s;e things to the &s;erious con|&s;ideration of all &s;uch as they more e&s;pecially concern; I mean, to all &s;uch as neglect a public profe&s;&s;ion of re|ligion, and coming to the Lord's table. I am far from a di&s;po&s;ition to upbraid any of their faults; but you will &s;uffer me to &s;ay, in a &s;pirit of love, that this is verily a fault, and a defect in your chri&s;tian character, much to be lamented. Let me be&s;eech you to think &s;eriou&s;ly of the&s;e things;&mdash;to con&s;ider and realize what the Go&s;pel requires of you;&mdash;what is your duty, and what your intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Whenever you enter &s;oberly into religion's views and meditations, with re&s;pect to your&s;elves (which I hope you, at lea&s;t, &s;ometimes do) this defect in your character,

as chri&s;tians,&mdash;as the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, mu&s;t cer|tainly give you great unea&s;ine&s;s. Will you not then, aim at having this unea&s;ine&s;s removed, and obtaining &s;ome good hope of &s;alvation, by endeavouring to get over all difficulties and di&s;couragements, and to &s;tand perfect and compleat in all the will of God? This I heartily wi&s;h for you, that you may &s;o own and confe&s;s Chri&s;t now before men, as that hereafter he may confe&s;s and own you before his Father which is in heaven.</P>
<P>TO CONCLUDE. Let us all be concerned to &s;tudy the Go&s;pel more, and to regard and practice the duties of it better. The more we acquaint our&s;elves with this divine &s;cheme of religion, the more excellent, and impor|tant it will appear to us:&mdash;the more free from perplex|ing difficulties;&mdash;the more clear and intelligible;&mdash;a doctrine according to godline&s;s;&mdash;a &s;cheme of religion worthy of God to teach, and of us to receive, to believe, and practice.</P>
<P>And, O, let us &s;ee to it, that we do not &s;atisfy and content our&s;elves, with any thing &s;hort of what we are convinced the Go&s;pel requires of us, in order to our be|ing &s;aved. This is an affair of infinite con&s;equence, and ju&s;tly claims the deep concern of every one. And if on clear and &s;ufficient grounds, we are per&s;uaded we have the qualifications and character of Chri&s;t's true di&s;ciples, then may we &s;afely, and to our un&s;peakable comfort, tru&s;t in him, as our Redeemer and Saviour, and, thro' him, hope for the mercy of God, and for eternal life.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON II. The Father's drawing, nece&s;&s;ary to our coming unto Chri&s;t.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JOHN VI. 44.</BIBL>
<P>NO man can come to me, except the Father which hath &s;ent me draw him.&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF we con&s;ider men as rational and moral agents, the&s;e two things appear to me ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to their receiving the doctrines, and embracing the re|ligion of the Go&s;pel; and to the propriety of their being addre&s;&s;ed by the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, in the great affair of their &s;alvation:&mdash;One is, that they are able to under&s;tand what the Go&s;pel teaches; and the other,&mdash;that with &s;uch divine aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as they may hope for and depend upon, if they are not criminally wanting to them&s;elves, they are capable of doing what the Go&s;pel requires, as the condition of their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>If they under&s;tand not what the Go&s;pel teaches, it can be, while this is the ca&s;e, of no manner of u&s;e to them: And, admitting they under&s;tand, yet if they believe them|&s;elves incapable (all things con&s;idered) of doing what the Go&s;pel requires, it comes to much the &s;ame.</P>
<P>For, if a man is ever &s;o fully a&s;&s;ured, as to the condi|tion of &s;alvation, yet&punc; if he is per&s;uaded, at the &s;ame time, that the performing this condition, is wholly out of his power, it is much the &s;ame to him, as if he knew no|thing of &s;uch condition. Why &s;hould he be &s;olicitous, or concern him&s;elf in the matter, if he believes he can do nothing that will turn to any account?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="011506_0017_0F853A6F14DB0510">And it &s;eems not materially to alter the ca&s;e, for a man to believe he may be &s;aved, if he believes, at the &s;ame time, that, if he is &s;aved, this mu&s;t be by his having the condition of &s;alvation wrought in him, or by his being qualified for happine&s;s, thro' the irre&s;i&s;tible operation of a foreign cau&s;e, which is not at all within his reach; and under who&s;e operation and influence, he is to be merely pa&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion, what room, or ground is there for rational concern, or the lea&s;t attempt towards any re|ligious exertion? To be &s;ure, a man, thus per&s;uaded, can have nothing at all to do; and ought not, as a rational being, to think of doing any thing; and for the&s;e plain rea&s;ons,&mdash;becau&s;e he really believes he can do nothing; and becau&s;e, if any thing is done in him, and for him, he believes it will be by a cau&s;e, or agent, who&s;e operation he can neither help forward, nor re&s;i&s;t.&mdash;If this foreign active cau&s;e is to operate upon him, it will do &s;o, and nothing, from him, can hinder it;&mdash;if it is not to operate, he can do nothing to engage, or procure its operation.</P>
<P>Sentiments of this kind, being obviou&s;ly incon&s;i&s;tent with moral agency in men, and de&s;tructive of all rational concern, and endeavours to obtain &s;alvation, it becomes us, I conceive, to con&s;ider well, whether they have any ju&s;t foundation in the word of God, from whence we pretend to collect our religious opinions.</P>
<P>To enquire whether they have any foundation in rea&s;on, would be to offer an affront to the rea&s;on of mankind, as they appear. at fir&s;t view, to be irrational and ab&s;urd. But they claim, I mean, &s;ome claim for them, &s;ufficient &s;uffrage from &s;acred Scripture; and rea|&s;on mu&s;t &s;ubmit to Revelation. But a concern for the honor of God,&mdash;of religion, and for our own happine&s;s, may well lead us to enquire, whether pa&s;&s;ages of Scrip|ture, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to teach&punc; and &s;upport &s;uch &s;entiments, may not be fairly and ju&s;tly under&s;tood, in a &s;en&s;e more honorary to the Deity;&mdash; more agreeable to the general tenor of his word, and more favourable to the intere&s;t of religion, and the happine&s;s of men.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="011506_0018_0F853A6FC676CCE8">An opinion of the nature and complexion of tho&s;e I have hinted at, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be taught in tho&s;e words of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour I have now read.</P>

<P>By the Father's drawing here is &s;uppo&s;ed to be meant, an inward, irre&s;i&s;tible operation, or influence of the Spirit of God upon the &s;oul, whereby a &s;inner is drawn to Chri&s;t; i. e. brought to believe in him &s;o as to be &s;aved.

<P>That we may enter into the true meaning of the text, and receive and entertain tho&s;e religious &s;entiments it may fairly and ju&s;tly teach us, it may be proper to con&s;ider particularly,

<ITEM>FIRST, What is to be under&s;tood by per&s;ons com|coming to Chri&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECONDLY, What&mdash;by the Father's drawing &s;uch as come to him: from whence it may appear,</ITEM>
<ITEM>THIRDLY, How no man can come to Chri&s;t, unle&s;s drawn by the Father; and what is to be under|&s;tood by this. Let us con&s;ider</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<Q>FIRST, What is to be under&s;tood in the text, by per&s;ons coming to Chri&s;t.</Q>
<P>And by this, I apprehend, is intended their believing on him, as the divinely con&s;tituted and appointed Saviour: &mdash;their receiving his doctrines as the truth of God, and heartily embracing that religion which he taught;&mdash; their coming to him as his di&s;ciples, and &s;ubmitting them&s;elves to the rule and government of his &s;acred laws. For, by this coming to him mu&s;t be under&s;tood their complying with the condition of &s;alvation by him. Thus the 40th ver&s;e &s;eems to be parallel or &s;imilar to the text. <HI>And this is the will of him that &s;ent me, that every one which &s;eeth the Son, and believeth on him, may

have everla&s;ting life, and I will rai&s;e him up at the la&s;t day.</HI> And in the text. <HI>No man can come unto me, ex|cept the Father which hath &s;ent me draw him, and I will rai&s;e him up at the la&s;t day.</HI> In another place Chri&s;t thus blames the unbelieving Jews.&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John v. 40.</NOTE> <HI>Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life.</HI> There it is manife&s;t, that by their coming to him, was intended their com|plying with the condition of &s;alvation; or doing what was nece&s;&s;ary in order to their obtaining eternal life. i. e. their believing in him, and receiving him as the Saviour.</P>
<P>But what may put the matter beyond doubt, that coming to Chri&s;t, in the text, means the &s;ame with be|lieving in him, is his u&s;ing the&s;e as equivalent terms in another part of the context. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 35.</NOTE> <HI>And Je&s;us &s;aid unto them. I am the bread of Life: he that cometh to me &s;hall never hunger; and he that believeth on me &s;hall never thir&s;t.</HI> By this then, we are to under&s;tand per&s;ons believing in Chri&s;t, as the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah and Saviour:&mdash;their re|ceiving him as the Son of God:&mdash;their receiving his doctrines as divine truths, and entering heartily upon that religious and godly life which he taught:&mdash;For this, and nothing &s;hort of this, is repre&s;ented as the con|dition of &s;alvation by him.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider,
<Q>SECONDLY, What may be under&s;tood by the Father's drawing &s;uch as come to Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>And by this, I conceive, may be meant, in general, his offering to their minds proper in&s;truction, evidence, and motives, to per&s;uade and prevail with them to believe in Chri&s;t, and receive him for their Saviour. That this is the meaning of the text, may appear from what imme|diately follows, by way of explication and &s;upport of it. <HI>It is written in the Prophets, and they &s;hall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</HI> But how &s;hould men be taught of God? How &s;hould they hear and learn of the Father, concerning Chri&s;t, &s;o as to come to him? Undoubtedly
<PB N="22" REF="011506_0020_0F853A710520BA98">
by that revelation he has made, e&s;pecially by his Son; and by that evidence he has given, that he is the true Me&s;&s;iah and Saviour.</P>
<P>And le&s;t the Jews, to whom Chri&s;t now addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, &s;hould imagine, that he &s;pake of per&s;ons being immediately taught of God, as by &s;ome &s;ecret impre&s;&s;ion or operation upon their minds, he directly added,&mdash; <HI>Not that any man hath &s;een the Father, &s;ave he which is of God</HI> (meaning him&s;elf) <HI>he hath &s;een the Father.</HI> Plainly intimatiing, that the manner in which God taught men, was by his Son, whom he &s;ent into the world for this end;&mdash;to declare his mind and will; and to &s;hew them the way to life and happine&s;s. For it ought farther to be ob&s;erved, that the prophecy refered to by our Saviour, manife&s;tly related to the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Compare Jer. xxxi. 31. and on, with Heb. viii 8. and on.</NOTE> Go&s;pel; &mdash; to the time when God would &s;end forth his Son, as a glorious light into the world; to teach men the knowledge of the truth, and to &s;hew them the way of Salvation.</P>
<P>By God's drawing &s;uch as come to Chri&s;t, or believe in him, we may under&s;tand therefore,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, his in&s;tructing and enlightning their minds by the truths of the Go&s;pel;&mdash;by the doctrines revealed, and publi&s;hed by his Son.</P>
<P>For, Chri&s;t came into the world by appointment and commi&s;&s;ion from the Father; and acted in his mini&s;try, by authority from him. Hence he &s;aid,&mdash;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> <HI>My doctrine is not mine, but his that &s;ent me.</HI> And again, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>The word which you hear, is not mine, but the Father's which &s;ent me.</HI></P>
<P>And there appears a manife&s;t propriety, both of &s;en&s;e and language, in &s;aying "the Father draws men to Chri&s;t by the doctrines which he taught." In like manner St. Paul &s;peaks of fal&s;e teachers, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Act. xx <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> <HI>who &s;hould &s;peak perver&s;e things to draw away di&s;ciples after them:</HI> i. e. to induce men to believe and confide in them as their in&s;tructors and guides, and to become their followers.</P>
<P>The doctrines which Chri&s;t taught in his Father's name, evidently tended to lead men to him;&mdash;to prevail
<PB N="23" REF="011506_0021_0F853A766483F238">
on them to believe in him, and to become his di&s;ciples, in as much as they pointed him out, agreeable to many ancient prophecies and predictions, as the true Me&s;&s;iah, and Saviour;&mdash;as they &s;et before them the pure&s;t and be&s;t religion in the world, and &s;trongly recommended it to their faith and practice:&mdash;as they taught men the true and only way to forgivene&s;s and favor with God, and &s;et before them a mo&s;t powerful motive, to lead and engage them to embrace his religion, the hope,&mdash;the high and important hope, of eternal life and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>Doctrines of this nature, were directly and excellently fitted to draw men to Chri&s;t;&mdash;to per&s;uade and prevail with them to believe in him, and to become his di&s;ciples and followers. And accordingly Chri&s;t blamed the Jews, for their infidelity, and refu&s;ing to come to him, when they had tho&s;e &s;criptures in their hands, which te&s;tified of him. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John v. 39, 40.</NOTE> <HI>Search the &s;criptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which te&s;tify of me. And ye will not come unto me that ye might have life.</HI></P>
<P>Peter and his brethren acted a different part, being convinced and per&s;uaded that Chri&s;t was &s;ent from God, and taught the way to life and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. Thus, when &s;ome for&s;ook him, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Context ver. 68, 69.</NOTE> <HI>Je&s;us &s;aid, will ye al&s;o go away? Peter an&s;wered him, Lord, to whom &s;hall we go? thou ha&s;t the words of eternal life, and we believe and are &s;ure that thou art the Chri&s;t, the Son of the living God.</HI> The doctrines which he taught had a prevailing influence upon them: convinced hereby that he was the Chri&s;t,&mdash; the promi&s;ed Saviour, they were drawn and engaged to him, and would not for&s;ake him like others. He had the words of eternal life; to whom then &s;hould they go, but to him, for &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing?</P>
<P>But again,
<Q>Secondly, God may be con&s;idered as drawing &s;uch as come to Chri&s;t, by the many miracles Chri&s;t wrought in his name, as evidence of his divine mi&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>Though the doctrines Chri&s;t delivered were, from the nature of them, a clear and good evidence, that he was a

teacher &s;ent from God, yet they were not the only, nor the mo&s;t powerful proof of his divine mi&s;&s;ion, and that he was, indeed, the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world: And accordingly, he more generally, and con|&s;tantly appealed to the works which he did,&mdash;to the mi|racles which he wrought, as evidence of this. Thus, to the Jews who &s;aid to him, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John x. 24, 25.</NOTE> <HI>if thou be the Chri&s;t, tell us plainly. He an&s;wered,&mdash;I have told you, and ye be|lieved not: the works that I do, in my Father's name, they bear witne&s;s of me.</HI> So again, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or el&s;e believe me for the very work's &s;ake.</HI> And upon this ground he thus blamed the Jews for not believing in him. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xv. 24.</NOTE> <HI>If I had not done among them the works, which none other man did, they had not had &s;in</HI> (i. e. they would not have been blame worthy for not believing in him) <HI>but now</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>they have both &s;een and hated, both me and my Father.</HI> i. e.

<P>And the Apo&s;tle John tells us, that the very end of committing an account of his miracles to writing, was this, that men might believe in him, as the Son of God. &mdash;<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">John xx. 30, 31.</NOTE> <HI>Many other &s;igns truly did Je&s;us, in the pre&s;ence of his di&s;ciples, which are not witten in this book; but the&s;e are written, that ye might believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, and that believing ye might have life thro' his name.</HI></P>
<P>Now, by all this it appears, with what propriety God may be con&s;idered as drawing men to Chri&s;t, by the mi|racles which he wrought. The&s;e &s;erved, not only to awaken and engage their attention to his doctrine, but directly and powerfully to convince them, that he was, as he declared him&s;elf to be, the Son of God;&mdash;that he was &s;ent into the world by the Father;&mdash;that God was with him;&mdash;that he owned him in what he did; and that his doctrines were the truths of God.</P>

And agreeably Chri&s;t &s;aid&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xii. 32.</NOTE><HI>And, I, if I be lifted up from the Earth, will draw all men unto me.</HI> His mean|ing &s;eems to be, that by the manner of his &s;uffering and death, and the wonderful things that would attend his pa&s;&s;ion;&mdash;by his re&s;urrection, and a&s;cention into heaven, whereby he would be fully demon&s;trated to be the Son of God; and by the de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t, in con|&s;equence hereof, which would confirm his doctrines by &s;igns and wonders,&mdash;that by the&s;e things, enough would be done, to prevail with all men to believe in him:&mdash;not that all men would be actually drawn to him; for the event &s;hewed otherwi&s;e. But once more,
<Q>Thirdly, God may be con&s;idered as drawing &s;uch as come to Chri&s;t, by the agency and influences of his holy Spirit, accompanying the external means of religion.</Q></P>
<P>For altho' an irre&s;i&s;tible operation or influence upon the &s;oul, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion, &s;eems not to be a doctrine of the Go&s;pel; and is manife&s;tly incon&s;i&s;tent with, or de&s;tructive of, moral agency in men (for &s;o far as our actions are the effect of a foreign cau&s;e, irre&s;i&s;tibly urging, and impelling us, &s;o far the&s;e acts are nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable, and, as moral agents, we have no con|cern in them: Nay, we are not agents, properly &s;peak|ing, in a moral &s;en&s;e, or in any other; but merely pa&s;|&s;ive machines, acted upon, all who&s;e motions are nece&s;|&s;ary, like tho&s;e of a clock or a watch, which are forced by &s;prings or weights.) But altho', I &s;ay, an irre&s;i&s;tible operation or influence, be not &s;uppo&s;ed, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion, yet we have &s;ufficient rea&s;on from the word of God, to believe that he aids and a&s;&s;i&s;ts per&s;ons by his holy Spirit. We are directed to <HI>a&s;k</HI> this of him, and are a&s;&s;&s;ured by our Saviour, that <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke xi. 13.</NOTE> <HI>he will give his holy Spirit to them that a&s;k him.</HI> So per&s;ons are &s;aid <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 22.</NOTE> <HI>to purify their &s;ouls, in obeying the truth thro' the Spirit.</HI>

Some are &s;poken of as <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;. v. 19.</NOTE> <HI>re&s;i&s;ting the holy Gho&s;t.</HI> And we are cautioned again&s;t <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 30.</NOTE> <HI>quenching, and grieving the holy Spirit of God.</HI> From all which it may be ju&s;tly concluded, that God accompanies the external means of religion, with the influence of his Spirit; and is ready, thereby, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in working out their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>How the Spirit of God acts, in this affair, may be dif|ficult for us to conceive, tho', doubtle&s;s, God deals with men, in this, as in all other things, in a manner agreeable to that nature he has given them:&mdash;that the influences of his Spirit do not &s;u&s;pend, or de&s;troy the free u&s;e and exerci&s;e of their intellectual and rational powers, but a&s;|&s;i&s;t them in their proper operation;&mdash;perhaps, by bring|ing things to remembrance, whereby they have a repeated and fre&s;h idea of them;&mdash;by fixing their attention to &s;ubjects of a religious nature and tendency, and cau&s;ing the&s;e to appear before them, in a clear and &s;trong light; &mdash;and by impre&s;&s;ing things upon their minds, whereby they may be more &s;en&s;ible of their ju&s;t weight, and im|portance, and thereby, a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in forming reli|gious purpo&s;es, re&s;olutions, and the like.</P>
<P>But, in whatever way, or manner God aids and a&s;&s;i&s;ts per&s;ons, by his Spirit, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion, &s;o far as he does this, he may be properly con&s;idered, as here|by, <HI>drawing</HI> &s;uch as come to Chri&s;t; or that believe in him, and embrace his religion. His agency in this, con|curs with the other advantages, he has put into their hands, to convince and &s;atisfy them, that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t&mdash;the Son of God; and to per&s;uade and prevail with them to receive his doctrines, and to become his di&s;ciples and followers.</P>
<P>And now, upon what has been offered, we may ea&s;ily &s;ee, and under&s;tand, <Q>THIRDLY, How no man can come unto Chri&s;t, unle&s;s the Father draw him.</Q></P>
<P>No man will,&mdash;no man can, come unto Chri&s;t, in the &s;en&s;e of the text; i. e. believe in him,&mdash;receive him for his Saviour, and become his di&s;ciple, unle&s;s he be con|vinced, by the miracles which he wrought, or by other
<PB N="27" REF="011506_0025_0F853A7A21754308">
arguments, of his divine mi&s;&s;ion;&mdash;that he is the Son of God, and the Saviour of Sinners. No man will thus come unto him, unle&s;s taught, and in&s;tructed, by the Go&s;pel, who, and what he is;&mdash;what is the nature of his religion; what the condition of Salvation by him, and hath the proper motives &amp; encouragements, to become a Chri&s;tian, thereby &s;et before him. Nor, may we &s;uppo&s;e any will thus come to Chri&s;t, without the aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's holy Spirit, whereby they may be enabled to overcome the power of Sin;&mdash;to re&s;i&s;t temptation to it;&mdash;to &s;ubdue and mortify their Corruptions;&mdash;cordially to receive and entertain the doctrines and precepts of the Go&s;pel; and to purify their Souls in obeying the truth.</P>
<P>To be thus drawn of the Father, i. e. to be favoured by God, with the&s;e advantages for religion, it is obvious, is nece&s;&s;ary to any man's coming to Chri&s;t, i. e. to his believing in him, and becoming a real chri&s;tian. Not that we are to conclude from hence, that all who are thus <HI>drawn</HI> of the Father, or thus favoured with reli|gious advantages, will, in a &s;aving &s;en&s;e, come to Chri&s;t. The&s;e advantages may be &s;ufficient for that end, and yet they maybe abu&s;ed, and men may peri&s;h notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Some, through unrea&s;onable prejudices, or other bad cau&s;es, may remain unconvinced, as many of the Jews were, of our Saviour's divine mi&s;&s;ion and character;&mdash; they may ob&s;tinately contradict and bla&s;pheme the truth, as &s;ome of them did; and like them, re&s;i&s;t the holy Gho&s;t;&mdash;grieve the Spirit of God;&mdash;quench its influ|ences; and go on, and peri&s;h in their &s;ins. As Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>if he were lifted up, he would draw all men unto him</HI>; intimating that his pa&s;&s;ion, and re&s;urrection from the dead, and other wonderful things, attending, and con&s;equent thereupon, would be &s;ufficient to prove he was the Son of God; and to induce all men to believe in him, as &s;uch; and yet multitudes were not prevailed with, hereby, to come unto him; &s;o the&s;e advantages for religion;&mdash;per&s;ons being thus <HI>drawn</HI> of the Father, may be &s;ufficient for their coming to Chri&s;t, and yet many, through their own fault;&mdash;through their own non-im|provement or abu&s;e of the&s;e advantages, may, neverthe|le&s;s, mi&s;s of &s;alvation.</P>

<HEAD>Improvement.</HEAD>
<P>UPON what has been offered upon the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, we may ju&s;tly remark,
<Q>FIRST, The great favor and kindne&s;s of God to us, in the advantages for religion we enjoy.</Q></P>
<P>God &s;ays, in reference to his goodne&s;s to the children of I&s;rael, in delivering them from their Egyptian bon|dage, and in other benefits and ble&s;&s;ings conferred upon them, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;. xi. 4.</NOTE> <HI>I drew them with the cords of a man, and with the bands of love.</HI> i. e. He did every thing for them, that was proper to work upon their ingenuity, as men, and to draw them to him&s;elf;&mdash;to engage them to love and &s;erve him, though many of them were rebellious and wicked. But how much greater things has God done for us, to draw us to him&s;elf by Je&s;us Chri&s;t? He has now &s;ent his own Son into the world, to die as a &s;acrifice of atonement for our &s;ins:&mdash;He has &s;ent him to reveal to us the riches of his grace towards &s;inners;&mdash;to teach us our duty, and to &s;hew us the way to happine&s;s.&mdash; He has &s;et before us &s;ufficient evidence, that Chri&s;t is the Saviour of &s;inners; and placed, in our view, the &s;tronge&s;t motives, to induce us to believe in him, and to &s;eek &s;alvation by him. And, in addition to all this, he is ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t us by his holy and good Spirit, in the important work of religion; and in &s;ecuring our future &mdash;our highe&s;t, and everla&s;ting happine&s;s. Surely, we ought to con&s;ider, and to be &s;en&s;ible,&mdash;gratefully &s;en&s;ible, of the loving-kindne&s;s of God to us in this, and to be concerned, every one of us, that we receive not his grace in vain.</P>
<Q>SECONDLY, We may infer&mdash;the great and awful danger, of per&s;ons neglecting to endeavour a reli|gious life, from an imagination, that if ever they are converted, and become real chri&s;tians, this mu&s;t be by an irre&s;i&s;tible operation upon their &s;ouls.</Q>
<P>How &s;trange &s;oever &s;uch a &s;entiment as this may ap|pear to any, yet it, not only has been, but, it may be feared, it is &s;till the opinion of &s;ome: And from hence,
<PB N="29" REF="011506_0027_0F853A7B825A43B0">
it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, they continue ea&s;y and quiet, in a di&s;obedient and wicked life. For (poor unhappy &s;ouls!) what &s;hould they do?&mdash;or to what purpo&s;e think of be&s;tirring them&s;elves? Conver&s;ion, they believe, is not at all within their own power, or reach:&mdash;They can nei|ther help it forward, nor hinder it:&mdash;They had e'en as good, therefore, be ea&s;y and quiet, as not.&mdash;If they are to be &s;aved, they &s;hall be converted, after a while, by an irre&s;i&s;tible operation.</P>
<P>How dangerous may be the influence of &s;uch an opinion as this! How fatal the con&s;equence! How di|rectly does it tend to &s;ooth and quiet the &s;inner's &s;oul, and to lead him on to eternal ruin!</P>
<P>If this opinion is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the truth, how ab|&s;urd mu&s;t it be, for mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, to addre&s;s them&s;elves to &s;inners, and urge them to repentance, and an holy life? They might as well preach to the trees in the forre&s;t, or to the &s;tones in the &s;treet, and urge them to virtue and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing this opinion to be the truth, with what rea&s;on or propriety could Peter &s;peak to the wicked Jews, as he did. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts iii. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Repent ye&mdash;and be converted, that your &s;ins may be blotted out.</HI> If he believed they could repent of their wickedne&s;s, and turn from it, his addre&s;s to them, was, indeed, perfectly rational: But, if he &s;up|po&s;ed this, not at all in their power, could any thing, then, be more impertinent, and unrea&s;onable, than this exhortation? What was it, but to exhort and urge them to a thing, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be impo&s;&s;ible to them?</P>
<P>And why did our Saviour blame tho&s;e Jews for not coming to him? <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John v. 40.</NOTE> <HI>And ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life.</HI> Their not coming to him, is certainly repre&s;ented as their fault: but could they be to blame for this, if they were wholly unable to come? What better excu&s;e could be made for their not coming, than their utter inability? No authority,&mdash;I mean, no ju&s;t authority, human or divine, can require ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;i|bilities, and charge blame for non-performance. The very &s;uppo&s;ition is incon&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on and equity, and directly de&s;troys it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="011506_0028_0F853A7C42C021D0">The many exhortations therefore, to Sinners, we meet with in the word of God, to repent;&mdash;to turn from their evil ways;&mdash;to come unto Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &amp;c.

<P>Study much the holy Go&s;pel;&mdash;that divine revelation God has made to you by this his Son:&mdash;Con&s;ider its doctrines and precepts, as delivering to you the mind of God. Con&s;ider what it requires of you as the way to pardon;&mdash;to life, and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and be concerned to comply with all its divine injunctions.</P>
<P>Often call to mind the great motives and encourage|ments to a religious life, which are exhibited in the Go&s;|pel, and &s;eriou&s;ly reflect on the end and de&s;ign thereof, as to you:&mdash;Con&s;ider, that by all the&s;e things, God is <HI>drawing</HI> of you, as it were, <HI>with the cords of a man, and with the bands of love;</HI>&mdash;that they are all de&s;igned to per&s;uade, and prevail with you to come to Chri&s;t;&mdash;to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> his doctrines:&mdash;to embrace <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
