<P>I AM &s;orry to acquaint you that one <HI>Frederick Stump,</HI> and <HI>John Ironcutter,</HI> &s;ome Time ago, having &s;old &s;ome Rum to a few <HI>Indians</HI> of your Nations, they all got drunk at <HI>Stump</HI>'s Hou&s;e on <HI>Middle Creek,</HI> and, in their Liquor, threatened to kill him and his Family, as he &s;ays; on which tho&s;e two wicked Men murdered &s;everal of your People.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You mu&s;t all be &s;en&s;ible that there are bad and fooli&s;h People of all Nations, whom at Times the evil Spirit gets the better of, and tempts to murder their mo&s;t intimate Friends, and even Relations, in order to di&s;turb the Peace and Tranquillity of their Neighbours&mdash;The&s;e Accidents often happen among&s;t your&s;elves, as well as among us, but the imprudent Act of a few fooli&s;h People &s;hould not di&s;turb the Peace of the many wi&s;e and innocent among&s;t us.</P>
<P>The great Giver of life has given us a good Heart, and Tongues to &s;peak the Sen|timents of our Hearts to each other&mdash;And when any Misfortune happens of this Kind to either of us, we &s;hould con&s;ider well the Con&s;equences, and meet under the Tree of Peace, and &s;moke together as our Forefathers formerly did, and endeavour to ad|ju&s;t and &s;ettle any Di&s;putes that might formerly happen, that &s;o no black Clouds might ari&s;e over our Heads, to prevent us from &s;eeing the Sun ri&s;e and &s;et over us in the &s;tricte&s;t Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>This is the Method I propo&s;e to take on this unlucky Occa&s;ion, and recommend to you my Brethren, and de&s;ire you may re&s;t ea&s;y and &s;atisfied till you hear from me again. The &s;tricte&s;t Ju&s;tice &s;hall be done you, and I make no Doubt but you will be &s;atisfied with my Conduct.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t hearing of this unfortunate Affair, I i&s;&s;ued a Proclamation, and had tho&s;e two Men apprehended and put into Pri&s;on, and make no Doubt but to bring them to that Puni&s;hment &s;o heinous a Crime de&s;erves, by the Laws of their Country.</P>
<P>I have wrote to Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> and informed him of this Accident; and as &s;oon as my Expre&s;s returns, you may be &s;ure to hear from me and him farther on this Matter, and more to your Satisfaction, at you will be convinced of the Ju&s;tice and upright Intentions of all His Maje&s;ty's Subjects, towards your &s;everal Nations.</P>

<P>The Grief and Concern which you have expre&s;&s;ed to us, on Account of the late Mi&s;chiefs committed on our People, we believe to be very &s;incere, and that they were cau&s;ed by the Evil Spirit.

<P>They are al&s;o unea&s;y to &s;ee that you think your&s;elves Ma&s;ters of this Country, be|cau&s;e you have taken it from the <HI>French,</HI> who you know had no Right to it, as it is the Property of us <HI>Indians.</HI> We often hear that you intend to fight with the <HI>French</HI> again, if you do, we de&s;ire you will remove your Quarrel out of this Country, and carry it over the great Waters, where you u&s;ed to fight, and where we &s;hall neither &s;ee or know any Thing of it. All we de&s;ire is to enjoy a quiet Peace with you both&punc; and that we &s;hould be &s;trong in talking of Peace.</P>
<P>We have now &s;poken to you from our Hearts, and hope we &s;hall exert our&s;elves in promoting a la&s;ting Friend&s;hip. All we have to &s;ay to you now is to be &s;trong, and let us agree to what we de&s;ire of each other. When you fir&s;t talked of Peace to us, you de&s;ired us to &s;it over the River quietl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at our Fires; but our Women and Children were frightened away by the Noi&s;e you made in repairing your Fort; but if you do as we de&s;ired you, they will return without Fear.</P>

<P>You have heard what we have de&s;ired in our la&s;t Speech, and we hope you will comply with our Reque&s;t, and not attempt to go down this River again, as the Na|tions who live that Way are &s;urprized to &s;ee you make a Practice of this, at the &s;ame Time that you were making Profe&s;&s;ions of Friend&s;hip to us.

<P>What our Chief has ju&s;t now mentioned to you is very true, and you will &s;ee by this Paper, that, during the late unhappy Differences between us, we held a Treaty with Colonel <HI>Broad&s;treet,</HI> by which we agreed, that you had a Right to build Forts and trading Hou&s;es where you plea&s;ed, and to travel the Road of Peace, from the Sun-ri&s;ing to the Sun-&s;etting.

<P>It gave us great Plea&s;ure to hear what you &s;aid the other Day to your Brother <HI>Onas</HI> and we thank you in his Name for the Readine&s;s you di&s;covered in brightening and making &s;trong our antient Chain of Friend&s;hip.

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We e&s;teem it a &s;trong Mark of the Sincerity and Goodne&s;s of your Hearts, that you have opened them to us &s;o freely and fully, as your Brother <HI>Onas</HI> earne&s;tly de&s;ired you, that he might know whatever lay &s;till concealed within your Brea&s;ts, which gave you any Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have al&s;o freely, and without Re&s;erve, informed us that the only Grievance which you now have Rea&s;on to complain of, is the Settlement made on your Lands We are glad, Brethren, we have now &s;o good an Opportunity of acquainting you, as well as the &s;everal Nations pre&s;ent, with the Mind of your Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> and the En+deavours which have been u&s;ed to do you Ju&s;tice in this Re&s;pect.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We can a&s;&s;ure you that nothing has given him more Concern than to find a Number of fooli&s;h People &s;hould dare to &s;eat them&s;elves on Lands in this Province, which your good Friends the Proprietors have not a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> yet purcha&s;ed from you. Governor <HI>Penn,</HI> therefore, as well from his own &s;incere and earne&s;t Inclinations to remove this Inju|ry done you, as by the expre&s;s Commands of our great King <HI>George,</HI> i&s;&s;ued Proclama|tions, near two Years ago, ordering all Per&s;ons what&s;oever, who had &s;ettled on your Lands, to remove without Delay, and forbidding others from taking the lea&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any, under the &s;evere&s;t Penalty of the Law.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As the People, who have &s;ettled your Lands, came chiefly from <HI>Virginia,</HI> the Go|vernor of that Province likewi&s;e i&s;&s;ued Proclamations and Orders to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. The King's General too (His Excellency General <HI>Gage)</HI> hath twice &s;ent up Parties of Soldiers to the People living on <HI>Red&s;tone</HI> Creek and the <HI>Monongabela,</HI> to warn them off your Lands, and threatened them with &s;eizing their Per&s;ons and Effects, if they re|fu&s;ed to move away. But, Brethren, we are &s;orry to tell you, that none of the&s;e Mea|&s;ures have had the de&s;ired Effect; and, therefore, Governor <HI>Penn,</HI> and his A&s;&s;embly, having &s;till your Intere&s;t greatly at Heart, pa&s;&s;ed a Law, in <HI>February</HI> la&s;t, inflicting the Penalty of Death on all Per&s;ons who &s;hould continue on your Lands after the fir&s;t Day of <HI>June</HI> next; and, in order that the People, who were &s;ettled on them, might have timely and proper Notice of that Law, Governor <HI>Penn,</HI> near two Months ago, &s;ent to them four prudent and hone&s;t Men to di&s;tribute Copies of it among them, with a Number of Proclamations, commanding them to obey it &s;trictly, under the Penalty of Death, and al&s;o to read and explain them fully to all tho&s;e People.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e four Men have lately returned home, and reported to the Governor of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania,</HI> that they had executed his Orders; but that they were told by the People
<PB N="15" REF="011301_0014_0F86F218A20394A0">
&s;ettled at and near <HI>Red&s;tone</HI> Creek,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE> that they had been encouraged by the <HI>Indians</HI> them|&s;elves to continue on tho&s;e Lands; that, however, they are determined to obey the Law, and move off without Delay. But, Brethren, we are &s;orry to tell you, that as &s;oon as the Men &s;ent by the Governor had prevailed on the Settlers to con&s;ent to a Compliance with the Law, there came among them eight <HI>Indians,</HI> who live at the <HI>Mingo</HI> Town down this River, and de&s;ired the People not to leave their Settlements, but to &s;it quiet on them till the pre&s;ent Treaty at this Place &s;hould be concluded. The People, on receiving this Advice and Encouragement, &s;uddenly changed their Minds, and determined not to quit their Places, till they &s;hould hear farther from the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> then delivered to the Men &s;ent by the Governor a String of Wampum, and a Speech, which they de&s;ired them to carry to the Governor. The Speech was this:&mdash;<Q>You are &s;ent here by your great Men to tell the&s;e People to go away from the Lands which you &s;ay is ours, and our great Men have &s;ent us, and we are glad to meet here the &s;ame Day. We tell you the white People mu&s;t &s;top, and we &s;top them till the Treaty; and when <HI>George Croghan</HI> and our great Men &s;hall &s;peak together, we will tell them what to do.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Brethren, we cannot help expre&s;&s;ing to you our great Concern at this Beha|viour of tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> as it has ab&s;olutely fru&s;trated the Steps the Governor was taking to do you Ju&s;tice, by the immediate Removal of tho&s;e People from your Lands. And we mu&s;t tell you. Brethren, that the Conduct of tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> appears to us very a&s;toni&s;h|ing; and we are much at a Lo&s;s to account for the Rea&s;on of it at this Time, when the <HI>Six Nations</HI> are complaining of Encroachments being made on their Lands. You your|&s;elves, Brethren, mu&s;t be very &s;en&s;ible that, while any of the <HI>Indians</HI> encourage the People to &s;tay on your Lands, it will inevitably defeat all our Mea&s;ures to remove them. But, Brethren, all that we have now to de&s;ire of you is, that you will immedi|ately &s;end off &s;ome of your prudent and wi&s;e Men with a Me&s;&s;age to the People &s;ettled at <HI>Red&s;tone, Youghoghainy,</HI> and <HI>Monongahela,</HI> to contradict the Advice of the eight <HI>Indians</HI> from the <HI>Mingo</HI> Town; and to acquaint them that you very much di&s;approve of their continuing any longer on their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ttlements; and that you expect they will quit them without Delay.</P>
<P>If you agree to this, we will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd an hone&s;t and di&s;creet white Man to accompany your Me&s;&s;engers. And, Brethren, if after receiving &s;uch Notice from you, they &s;hall refu&s;e to remove by the Time limited them, you may depend upon it, the Govern|ment will not fail to put the Law into immediate Execution again&s;t them.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners then, addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> &s;poke as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Part of your Speeches Ye&s;terday, you acquainted us that it was very di&s;a|greeable to you to &s;ee a Fort continued at this Place, contrary to your Expectations, and that you were very &s;orry to find a Number of Batteaus building here, in order to go down the River. With Regard to the&s;e Things we can only &s;ay, it is not a little &s;ur|prizing to us that you &s;hould mention them at this Time, as we have always under|&s;tood that this Matter was &s;ettled with the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and all other <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;everal Years ago, and their full Con&s;ent obtained for keeping Forts in your Country, as well as for going down this River to trade. But, Brethren, as we came here to confer with you on Subjects which only relate to the Province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> we have no Concern in this Bu&s;ine&s;s. It is an Affair of our great King of <HI>England,</HI> and as &s;uch we mu&s;t refer you for a more particular An&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> who, you know, is ap|pointed by his Maje&s;ty to tran&s;act his Affairs with the <HI>Indians</HI> in this Country.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It will give us much Plea&s;ure, when we return to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to communicate to the Governor all that has pa&s;&s;ed between us in the&s;e Conferences; and to a&s;&s;ure him of your friendly Di&s;po&s;itions and upright Intentions, which you may depend on we &s;hall faithfully do.</P>

<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners having fini&s;hed what they had to &s;ay to the <HI>Indians,</HI> Mr. <HI>Crog|han</HI> made them the following Speeches:</P>
<P><HI>Brethren the</HI> Shawane&s;e,</P>
<P>When you &s;poke Ye&s;terday to the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> you de&s;ired him to de|&s;troy this Fort, and not to pa&s;s down this River, as it was bloody; and &s;aid that our Warriors, pa&s;&s;ing through your Country, gave you and all other Nations great Unea|&s;ine&s;s in your Minds.&mdash;You are the only Nation that has mentioned this Circum|&s;tance, and I mu&s;t tell you that this Fort was built by the King's Orders, and that your Brother, the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> has no Concern in this Matter.</P>

<P>When I was fir&s;t going down this River, by Order of his Excellency General <HI>Gage&punc;</HI> and the Honourable Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> all the Nations now pre&s;ent agreed to it, and &s;ent Deputies with me to promote the good Works of Peace with all Nations o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Indians</HI> to the We&s;tward; and to receive them into the Chain of Friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the King's Subjects, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and all others in Alliance with them&punc; and to take them under his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t gracious Protection, which has been &s;inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> done.

<P>Your Forefathers lived in the &s;tricte&s;t Friend&s;hip with the worthy Founder of that Province, and the good People that came with him; and you have now renewed and brightened that antient Chain of Friend&s;hip with the Governors Commi&s;&s;ioners, in Be|half of the King's Subjects in that Government.

<P>You have all heard what the <HI>Six Nations</HI> &s;aid to you by their Deputies, that they heartily repented of their own pa&s;t ill Conduct towards their Brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in &s;tealing Hor&s;es and committing other Abu&s;es; and they have de&s;ired you, Brethren, to ca&s;t out all evil Thoughts from your Minds, and return any &s;tolen Hor&s;es you may have among&s;t you, and think of nothing, for the future, but promoting the good Work of Peace between you and your good Brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> your Father and my Ma&s;ter, takes Delight in promot|ing Peace among all Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> in this Country, and his own Subjects, which you mu&s;t be well acquainted with. You all daily experience his Love towards you, and his Pity for your Nece&s;&s;ities, by the Favours you con&s;tantly receive from his Of|ficers here and el&s;ewhere, and I am &s;orry to &s;ay that your pa&s;t Conduct &s;hews a Want of Gratitude in you to his Subjects.</P>
<P>Whenever the King makes Peace with any Nation, he never violates his Engage|ments, though he always has it in his Power to cha&s;tize any People that dare be &s;o hardy as to di&s;turb the Tranquillity of their Neighbours.&mdash;But I now tru&s;t, Brethren, that your future Conduct will be &s;uch as may merit his Maje&s;ty's E&s;teem and Protec|tion.</P>
<P>By this Belt I now clear the Road of Peace, and make it &s;mooth and ea&s;y to travel, from the Sun-ri&s;ing to the Sun-&s;etting, that your Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and all Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> may travel it with Plea&s;ure, as one People, united in the &s;tronge&s;t Chain of Friend&s;hip, that our Women, and Children yet unborn, may mutually enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ings of a la&s;ting Peace.</P>

<P>I am &s;orry to hear from &s;ome of your Brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that whenever any of them pa&s;s by your Village, you take Rum and other Things from them. You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible this Conduct is very wrong, and a Breach of your Engagements to us. I hope I &s;hall hear no more of it. You have been de&s;ired three Years ago, by the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Council, to remove up this River nearer to their Country, and I now de&s;ire

<P>THE <HI>Six Nations,</HI> at the public Conferences held la&s;t Week with them an|other Tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> at this Place, renewed their Complaints of Encroach|ments being made on their Lands; and they have agreed, at our In&s;tance, to &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> four Me&s;&s;engers to the People &s;ettled on the Waters of the <HI>Monongahela</HI> and <HI>Youghio+gany,</HI> to expre&s;s their great Di&s;approbation of their continuing &s;till there; and al&s;o to let them know that it is expected, by the whole Confederacy of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> that they will remove from the Lands they have unju&s;tly taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, without further Delay.

<P>As &s;oon as you arrive in the mid&s;t of the Settlements near <HI>Red&s;tone</HI> Creek, it will be proper to convene as many of the Settlers as po&s;&s;ible, to whom the <HI>Indians</HI> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> then deliver their Me&s;&s;age, which &s;hall be given to you in Writing; and we de&s;ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you will leave a few Copies of it with the principal People, that they may commu+nicate the &s;ame to tho&s;e who live at any con&s;iderable Di&s;tance from them.

<P>But &s;hould you find any of tho&s;e incon&s;iderate People &s;till actuated by a lawle&s;s and ob&s;tinate Spirit to bid Defiance to the civil Authority, you may let them know, that we were under no Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending, in the Name of the Governor, any further Notice to them, or of being at the Pains of making them acquainted with the real Minds of the <HI>Indians,</HI> to induce them to quit their Settlements, for that the Powers of Government are &s;ufficient to compel them to pay due Obedience to the Laws; and they may depend upon it, they will be effectually exerted, if they per&s;i&s;t in their Ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>You may likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ure them, that they need not attempt to make an Offer of Terms with the Government re&s;pecting their Removal, as we hear &s;ome of them have vainly propo&s;ed to do, by &s;aying, they would go off the Lands immediately, on Condition that they &s;hould be &s;ecured to them as &s;oon as the Proprietary Purcha&s;e is made.

<P>The only Motives, therefore, which excite us to make U&s;e of the pre&s;ent Ex|pedient of &s;ending you with Me&s;&s;engers from the <HI>Indians</HI> on this Occa&s;ion, is the compa&s;&s;ionate Concern we have for the dangerous Situation and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e unhappy People, and the Hopes we have that, by this Means, they may be convinced it is their true and be&s;t Intere&s;t to pay a due Submi&s;&s;ion to the Laws, by relinqui&s;hing their Settlements without Delay. If any of them &s;hould talk of petitioning the Go|vernor for a Preference in taking up the Lands they have improved, you may a&s;&s;ure them from us, that it will be to no Manner of Purpo&s;e, till they have fir&s;t complied with the Law.</P>
<P>We depend greatly on your Care and Prudence in executing this Bu&s;ine&s;s to our Satisfaction, and recommend it to you to be particularly careful that the <HI>Indian</HI> Me&s;|&s;engers are treated with the greate&s;t Civility and Kindne&s;s.

<P>I am very &s;orry to find that you have been di&s;appointed in your Expectations of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Indian</HI> Me&s;&s;engers going to <HI>Red&s;tone,</HI> according to your De&s;ire, and our Agreement; and I am much afraid that you are now going away from us with a di&s;contented Mind, on this Account. Believe me, Brethren, this Thought fills my Heart with the deepe&s;t Grief, and I could not &s;uffer you to leave us without &s;peaking to you on this Subject, and endeavouring to make your Minds ea&s;y. We were all of us much di&s;po&s;ed to com|ply with your Reque&s;t, and expected it could have been done without Difficulty, but I now find that not only the <HI>Indians</HI> appointed by us, but all our other young Men&punc; are very unwilling to carry a Me&s;&s;age from us to the white People, ordering them to remove from our Lands. They &s;ay they would not choo&s;e to incur the ill Will o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tho&s;e People, for, if they &s;hould be now removed, they will hereafter return to thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Settlements, when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have purcha&s;ed the Country from us. And we &s;hall be very unhappy, if, by our Conduct towards them at this Time, we &s;hall give them Rea&s;on to di&s;like us, and treat us in an unkind Manner when they again become our Neighbours. We therefore hope, Brethren, you will not be di&s;plea&s;ed with us for not performing our Agreement with you, for you may be a&s;&s;ured that we have good Hearts towards all our Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
