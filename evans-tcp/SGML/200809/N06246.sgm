<P>The Governor opened the Conference, directing his Di&s;cour&s;e to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1757" UNIT="year"> I AM very glad to meet you once more with your People, and &s;ome of your Uncles the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> according to your Agreement with me at this Place in <HI>November</HI> la&s;t. The Number of <HI>Indians</HI> you have brought down with you on this Occa&s;ion, and the Pains you have taken to carry the News of our good Di&s;po&s;itions for Peace to &s;o great a Di&s;tance, confirms the good Opinion we have always had of you, and &s;hews the Sincerity of the Profe&s;&s;ions you have made of your earne&s;t De&s;ire to re&s;tore the Friend&s;hip and Bro|therly <PB N="4" REF="007921_0004_102E019853BB2D90">Love that always &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us and the <HI>Indians,</HI> till your fooli&s;h young Men were &s;educed by the evil Spirit, and turned again&s;t us.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyu&s;cung, <HI>and Brethren of the</HI> Ten-united-Nations,</P>
<P>We are now met together to fini&s;h, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Almighty, the Great Work of Peace, and to make a new Chain of Friend&s;hip &s;o bright, that it &s;hall never ru&s;t, and &s;o &s;trong, that it &s;hall never be in the Power of wicked Spirits to break it, that we may always hereafter be as one Man, with but one Heart and one Head. I invite you to join heartily and &s;incerely with me herein by this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>You may remember, that when we were here la&s;t Fall, I a&s;ked you what was the Cau&s;e of the Breach between our Brethren the <HI>Delawares</HI> and us; whether we, the People of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> had done you any Injury; and de&s;ired you would open your Hearts, and tell me your Mind freely. In an&s;wer to this you told me, that your fooli&s;h and ignorant young Men, when they &s;aw the Proceedings of our Enemy, the <HI>French</HI> King, and believed the Things that were told them, were per&s;uaded by this fal&s;e hearted King to &s;trike your Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; and that the Cau&s;e why the Blow came the harder on us was, that the Proprietaries had defrauded you of &s;ome of your Land, and that you had been treated in the &s;ame Man|ner in the <HI>Jer&s;eys</HI>; but that this was not the principal Cau&s;e of your &s;triking us. I was wil|ling to enquire into the Truth of this Charge at that Time, but you declined it, becau&s;e few of the <HI>Indians</HI> then pre&s;ent originally owned tho&s;e Lands; but &s;aid, that you would endeavour to bring as many of them down as you could find to the next Meeting.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>According to the Promi&s;e I made you at our la&s;t Treaty, I laid all our Proceedings before Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> who, you have been often told, is appointed by our Great King his &s;ole Agent for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs in this Di&s;trict, to take Care of them as a Father, that no one may wrong them. Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> has &s;ince deputed your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our Friend, Mr. <HI>George Crog|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an,</HI> who is well acquainted with your Affairs and Language, to act in his Behalf, to attend this Treaty, and enquire into every Grievance you may have &s;uffered, either from your Bre|thren of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> or the neighbouring Provinces.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>I took Care al&s;o to &s;end Copies of our &s;everal Treaties with you to <HI>England,</HI> where they were laid before the King's Mini&s;ters, who, being de&s;irous that Ju&s;tice &s;hould be done you, ordered that Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> &s;hould enquire into the Foundation of your Charge again&s;t this Province, in order that you may receive Satisfaction, in ca&s;e any Injury has been done you.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>I have freely opened my Heart to you, and am ready, with Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> His Maje&s;ty's Deputy Agent, whenever you think proper, to hear any Thing you may have to &s;ay to us about the Grievances you may think you labour under from this Province.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When the Governor had ended his Speech, I &s;poke as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyu&s;cung, <HI>and you my Brethren the Sachems and Warriors of the Ten Nations you repre&s;ent at this Meeting,</HI></P>
<P>You have been informed by your Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> that the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> your Fa|ther, has appointed Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> Baronet, to be His Maje&s;ty's chief Agent and Su|perintendent of the Affairs of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> their Allies and Dependents in this Di&s;trict of <HI>America,</HI> and he has appointed me his Deputy, and ordered me to attend this Meeting, and hear any Complaints you have to make again&s;t your Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> in re&s;pect to his defraud|ing you of the Lands mentioned in the Conference you held with this Government la&s;t Fall in this Town; or any other Injuries you have received from any of His Maje&s;ty's Subjects in this Di&s;trict. I am now ready to hear what you have to &s;ay; and I a&s;&s;ure you, in the Name of Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> I will do every Thing in my Power to have all Differences amicably adju&s;ted to your Satisfaction, agreeable to his Orders and In&s;tructions to me.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>When I had delivered my Speech, the Governor told <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> that we had done for the pre&s;ent; and that whenever he was ready to give an An&s;wer, we &s;hould be ready to hear him. Then <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> replied, That he had &s;omething to &s;ay now; and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">re&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Governor and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>I will let you know in a few Words what my De&s;ire is. I kindly receive your Words this Day: They are true, and make my Heart glad. By this Belt (holding up a Belt) I let you 
<PB N="5" REF="007921_0005_102E019A8C238F28">
know I will &s;peak To-morrow. I think it proper to &s;peak my Mind with Openne&s;s. I think it my Duty to remember the Conduct of my fooli&s;h young Men. I &s;ee a great deal of Mi&s;chief done. I will fir&s;t begin with cleaning up the Blood that has been &s;hed, and removing the dead Bodies out of the Way: After that, I will make known my Grievances. I remember what Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> &s;aid to me by the Me&s;&s;engers he &s;ent to me: I &s;ent back to him, by the &s;ame Me&s;&s;engers, and de&s;ired him, as he was a wi&s;er Man than I, and of greater Abilities, that he would be &s;trong, and lend his A&s;&s;i&s;tance to cure this Wound.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> had ended his Speech, he told the Governor he thought he &s;hould be ready to &s;peak To-morrow Morning at Eight o'Clock;&mdash;and that Time was accordingly ap|pointed for the next Meeting.</P>

<P>I de&s;ired the Favour of Mr. <HI>Jacob Duch&eacute;</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mr. <HI>Trent</HI> in taking down the Minutes.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;poke to the Governor and my&s;elf, de&s;iring us to give Attention; then directing his Speech to the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and all His Subjects, &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>YOU remember that you &s;ent to me to come down to you, and invited me to bring down with me as many of the <HI>Ten Nations</HI> as I could, by Rea&s;on of the Difficulty of the Times. You then &s;aid to me, Brother, you are weak, I am &s;trong: If you come down, I will put away all the Difference and Unea&s;ine&s;s that has happened, and will make a la&s;ting Peace. Now, as I have brought &s;ome from each of the <HI>Ten Nations</HI> with me, I would have you remember your Promi&s;e, and exert your Power. Al&s;o, remember our Women and Chil|dren, that it may be well hereafter. Al&s;o, as you mu&s;t remember the Blood that has been &s;hed, and the dead Bodies that lie &s;cattered up and down, I would have you join with me to remove the&s;e out of the Way, that we may &s;ee one another Face to Face, and after this we will proceed to other Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>As you are a great deal &s;tronger than I, you mu&s;t exert your Power. When Differences ari&s;e between two Brothers, when one comes and makes Propo&s;als of Peace, if the other does not accept them, nothing can be done. Now, as much Blood is &s;pilt, I de&s;ire you will join with me to clear this away, and when that is done, we will proceed to other Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>According to the Promi&s;e I made you, that I would invite as many of the <HI>Ten Nations</HI> as I could, I have now brought with me as many as I could, who are here pre&s;ent to witne&s;s what &s;hall be tran&s;acted; but, in order to make a la&s;ting and durable Peace, we mu&s;t all ex|ert our Abilities. When any Per&s;ons are engaged to lift a great Weight out of the Way, if all do not exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> their Strength, they cannot remove it; but if all join, they will ea&s;ily re|move it. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our Parts, gather up the Leaves that have been &s;prinkled with Blood; we gather up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ood, the Bodies and Bones; but when we look round, we &s;ee no Place where to put them, but when we look up, we &s;ee the Great Spir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> It is our Duty therefore to join in Prayer, that he would hide the&s;e Things, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> never be &s;een by <PB N="6" REF="007921_0006_102E019EE8AAFAF0">our Po&s;terity, and that the Great Spirit would ble&s;s our Children, that they may hereafter live in Love together; that it may never be in the Power of the evil Spirit, or any evil mind|ed Per&s;ons, to cau&s;e any Breach between our Pe&s;terity.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of &s;eventeen Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>As you remember you invited me to bring down &s;ome of the <HI>Ten Nations,</HI> &s;o now &s;ome from each of them are here pre&s;ent, particularly &s;ome from my Uncles the <HI>Five Nations.</HI> When we had endeavoured, as much as in our Power, to remove the dead Bodies, and the Mi&s;chief pa&s;t, you al&s;o invited me to come and take hold of your Hand. We accordingly now come, and take hold of one of your Hands, and the <HI>Five Nations</HI> al&s;o come and take hold of the other Hand, that we may all &s;tand together as one Man with one Heart. This now being done, when we look up, and &s;ee the clear Light, we &s;hall enjoy it; we &s;hall al&s;o enjoy, in Peace and Quietne&s;s, what the Land produces; and we &s;hall enjoy the Comforts of the Day, and the Comforts of the Night; we &s;hall lie down in Peace, and ri&s;e in Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of twelve Rows, &s;trung on Cords.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of this great Cloud of Mi&s;chief that has been pa&s;t is, that our old Standers, or Forefathers, never took regular Methods to have a la&s;ting Peace: They never looked for|ward for their Children: They only had a View of this that decays, and what lies round about upon the Earth. When they came into Council, they only talked about the Things on the Earth, that are &s;oon gone. They ought to have looked forward, and to have made &s;uch Agreements on both Sides, that their Children after might never di&s;agree. And as we &s;ee their Mi&s;management, let us do better, that we, as long as we live, may be faithful, and that by this our Meeting together our Children hereafter may enjoy a la&s;ting Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of eleven Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You remember, according to your Orders, that Me&s;&s;engers have been &s;ent to carry your Me&s;&s;ages to di&s;tant Parts among us, in order to promote this good, this important Work of Peace, on which our Lives depend. One of the&s;e Me&s;&s;engers is now in a dangerons Condi|tion, being &s;hot by one of your young Men. Do not be too much grieved; but as I de&s;ire to be u&s;ed with Ju&s;tice, according to your Laws, I in&s;i&s;t, if this young Man die, that the Man who &s;hot him may be tried by your Laws, and die al&s;o, in the Pre&s;ence of &s;ome of our People, who may witne&s;s it to all the Nations, that their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have done them Ju&s;tice. And if any Thing of the like Kind &s;hould happen on our Parts, we will do you the &s;ame Ju&s;tice; that is, if any of our People &s;hall murder any of yours, we will de|liver up the Murderer, to be tried by your Laws. And as the Relations of the young Man mu&s;t be grieved, I de&s;ire, as you have it in your Power, that you would remove the Grief and Sorrow from their Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor then acquainted <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> that we would take into Con&s;ideration what he had now &s;aid; and when we were ready to give an An&s;wer, we would let him know.</P>
<P>As we were ri&s;ing the King, by his Interpreter, told me, that what he had now &s;aid was of great Importance; he de&s;ired therefore we would take Time to confider it well; that he would wait with Patience till we were ready to give him an An&s;wer.</P>

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>YOUR Memory &s;erves you faithfully, with Re&s;pect to what was pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ed by each of us in the la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onferences.</P>
<P>Our warme&s;t A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">edgments are due to you for your ju&s;t Performance of your Engage|ments. You have made known our good Di&s;po&s;itions far and wide.

<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We are &s;en&s;ible with you, that unle&s;s we both exert the utmo&s;t of our Strength, we &s;hall not be able to accompli&s;h the great Work we are mutually engaged in.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we &s;ee the dead Bodies of our People lying uncovered, and expo&s;ed to ravenous Birds, it is again&s;t Nature, and all the Principles of Religion and Humanity, to proceed to the Confirmation of Peace.</P>
<P>We therefore, in Conjunction with you, diligently &s;earch for, and collect together, not only their dead Bodies and &s;cattered Bones, but the very Leaves, Gra&s;s, and every Thing el&s;e that their Blood has touched; and join with you in looking up to Heaven, from whence the God of Peace beholds with Delight our Advances to Reconciliation, Concord and Unity. We pray he may ca&s;t a Veil over all that has happened in the&s;e unhappy Times, that it may be no longer remembered. We &s;upplicate his Almighty Goodne&s;s to pardon all that is pa&s;t. We pray him to di&s;po&s;e all the People of this, and the &s;ucceeding Generations, to the late&s;t Po&s;terity, to live in Love together.

<P>Though our Forefathers and yours might make &s;ome Mi&s;takes, and might not &s;ee far enough into the Con&s;equences of &s;ome of their Mea&s;ures, yet in general we can truly &s;ay, they were ever kindly di&s;po&s;ed to one another; they were open and upright in their Inten|tions; they lived together in perfect Peace, and the mutual Exchange of good Offices.</P>
<P>It is very commendable in you to remind us that they have not been altogether regular, but confined their Views to the then pre&s;ent Times, and to the Intere&s;t of their own Ge|neration, not &s;o much con&s;ulting as they &s;hould have done the Good of future Generations. We &s;hall be glad to join with you in promoting one general Intere&s;t, that may extend to the late&s;t Po&s;terity. We will lay a&s;ide all narrow partial Regards, and put Matters on a la&s;ting Foundation, and endeavour to exceed our Ance&s;tors, not only in the Goodne&s;s of our Mea|&s;ures, but in a more careful and exact Manner of doing Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>We have ob&s;erved what you &s;ay, with re&s;pect to one of your Me&s;&s;engers. The Accident grieves us. In &s;uch Times, <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould not go &s;ingle, or into inhabited Parts, without proper Pa&s;&s;ports and E&s;corts.&mdash;We have carele&s;s and unthinking Men among&s;t us; we have bad Men too, who have mi&s;chievous Hearts. The Man who is &s;uppo&s;ed to have committed this Act is in Goal, and (in ca&s;e the Me&s;&s;enger dies) &s;hall be tried by our Laws, which re|quire Blood for Blood, in the Pre&s;ence of &s;uch <HI>Indians</HI> as you &s;hall appoint to attend the Trial, of which you &s;hall have due Notice. It is a Matter firmly &s;ettled, by repeated Treaties, between us and the <HI>Indians,</HI> that whenever an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> kills an <HI>Indian,</HI> or an <HI>Indian</HI> kills an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> the Murderer, or Per&s;on offending, &s;hall be tried by our Laws, in the Pre|&s;ence of both Nations.</P>

<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Governor, &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> DESIRE in a few Words to recollect what you told me the other Day, that the Great King, beyond the Water, had appointed a Man to over&s;ee the Affairs of the <HI>Indians,</HI> viz. Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> who has nominated Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> his Deputy. I am glad to hear this News, and to &s;ee the Man that is appointed. I hope, Brother, that it will be well accepted by both of us. It is our Duty to re&s;pect the Per&s;on that the King has appointed, and with Sincerity of Heart to join together, that as the pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s is well begun, it may end &s;o. I hope he will execute his Commi&s;&s;ion with Ju&s;tice. According to your De&s;ire, what you mentioned in the la&s;t Treaty, and what you have &s;aid now, I will an&s;wer in a few Words; and we hope Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> will be faithful to &s;ee Ju&s;tice done on both Sides in the Name of the King.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>After I have opened the Pa&s;&s;age from your Heart and Mind, that you may &s;ee and under&s;tand, by this Belt I de&s;ire you may fully under&s;tand what I now &s;ay. It is plain the Proceedings of our Ance&s;tors were &s;horter than they ought to have been, in Re&s;pect and Behalf of their Children; and al&s;o their own everla&s;ting Peace in the World to come. You may ea&s;ily &s;ee the Rea&s;on of the gloomy and dark Days; they have proceeded from the Earth. Our Mi&s;under&s;tanding or Mi&s;management has proceeded from the Earth, as well as our Diffe|rences and Grievances that have pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed. Though it was not the principal Cau&s;e that made us &s;trike our Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> yet it has cau&s;ed the Stroke to come harder than it otherwi&s;e would have come. Now it lies much in your Power to look &s;trictly into your Hearts, as we always prefer and acknowledge you above us in Abilities, Strength and Knowledge. And as it lies a great deal in your Power to know whether what I have &s;aid be true or not, it depends much on you, Brother, that it may be openly and publickly declared and publi&s;hed to the Province or Provinces under the Government of the Great King, both to his Satis|faction, and to the Satisfaction of tho&s;e appointed to manage this Affair.&mdash;Brother, now as we have met together Face to Face to &s;peak with great Sincerity, I will endeavour to lay every Thing plain before you, not to cover one Part, but to lay every Thing before you, that you may &s;ee plainly, in order that we may have true Satisfaction from one another, and that what may be proved to be our Right and Due, may be e&s;tabli&s;hed for ever in a durable and la&s;ting Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>I would de&s;ire al&s;o that you would look with all Diligence, and &s;ee from whence our Dif|ferences have &s;prung. You may ea&s;ily &s;ee they have &s;prung from the Land or Earth, which was mentioned before, though it was not the principal Thing. If regular Methods had been formerly taken for an Habitation or Re&s;idence for the poor <HI>Indians</HI> in this Land, this would not have come to pa&s;s. Now as it lies much in your Power to &s;earch particularly into what was mentioned before, with re&s;pect to the Land, which was the Cau&s;e of our Differences, <PB N="9" REF="007921_0009_102E01A5B1C472B0">if I now can prevail with you, as I hope I &s;hall, hone&s;tly to do what may be con&s;i&s;tent with Ju&s;tice, then I will, with a loud Voice, &s;peak, and the Nations &s;hall hear me. Then it depends on you, Brother, as I &s;hall &s;peak with a loud Voice, and as you are of great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Abilities than I, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, that what I &s;peak to the Nations may be true, and that when I have made Proclamation with a loud Voice, by your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the Nations may hear and receive it with great Joy.</P>
<P>Gave a Belt.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>John Pump&s;hire,</HI> being a&s;ked to explain what was meant by the fir&s;t Part of this Speech, he &s;aid, the Meaning was this: The Land is the Cau&s;e of our Differences; that is, our being unhappily turned out of the Land, is the Cau&s;e: And though the fir&s;t Settlers might pur|cha&s;e the Land fairly, yet they did not act well, nor do the <HI>Indians</HI> Ju&s;tice; for they ought to have re&s;erved &s;ome Place for the <HI>Indians.</HI> Had that been done, the&s;e Differences would not have happened.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have now in a few Words to let you know what my Inclination and De&s;ire is, agreeable to what I have &s;aid. I now put it into your Power to make a la&s;ting Peace, and that I may have my rea&s;onable Enjoyment from this Land; as we are &s;en&s;ible that this Land was made by that Almighty Power that has made all Things, and has given this Land to us. I was the fir&s;t to whom he gave it; and as it plea&s;ed him to convey you to us, and unite us in Friend&s;hip in the Manner already mentioned, which was well known by our Ance&s;tors, it is now in your Power, and depends entirely on your Care and faithful Diligence, that it may not be broken as it has been; and if it be broken, it will be owing to you. I think it is my Duty to mention to you in publick, that I will comply with all Submi&s;&s;ion. This I a&s;k, that I may have &s;ome Place for a Settlement, and for other good Purpo&s;es, in which we may both agree; but as I am a free Agent as well as you, I mu&s;t not be bound up, but have Li|berty to &s;ettle where I plea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of nine Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> informed the Governor, that he had done for this Time, and left it to the Go|vernor's Plea&s;ure to appoint a Time to an&s;wer him.</P>
<P>As the Governor had by Letter informed me, that <HI>Teedyu&s;cung's</HI> Speech appeared to him dark and confu&s;ed, and de&s;ired me to call a Meeting in private with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and know what they meant; I accordingly, on the 30th of <HI>July,</HI> at Five a Clock in the Morn|ing, &s;ent for the King, and &s;ome of his Coun&s;ellors, and de&s;ired them to call a Council and confider well the Speeches the King had made, and afterwards to explain them to me. At Half after Nine o'Clock, King <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> with <HI>Jepi&s;cauhunb, Epoweyowallund, Penawagh|wottind, Lepaghpetund, Kuhtanamaku, Jangepapawey, Weneywalika,</HI> his Coun&s;ellors, and <HI>John Pump&s;hire,</HI> Interpreter, met at my Hou&s;e, and explained his Speeches as follows.</P>
<P>The Complaints I made la&s;t Fall, I yet continue. I think &s;ome Lands have been bought by the Proprietary, or his Agents, from <HI>Indians</HI> who had not a Right to &s;ell, and to whom the Lands did not belong. I think al&s;o, when &s;ome Lands have been &s;old to the Proprietary by <HI>Indians</HI> who had a Right to &s;ell to a certain Place, whether that Purcha&s;e was to be mea|&s;ured by Miles or Hours Walk, that the Proprietaries have, contrary to Agreement or Bar|gain, taken in more Lands than they ought to have done, and Lands that belonged to others. I therefore now de&s;ire that you will produce the Writings and Deeds by which you hold the Land, and let them be read in publick, and examined, that it may be fully known from what <HI>Indians</HI> you have bought the Lands you hold, and how far your Purcha&s;es extend, that Copies of the Whole may be laid before King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> and publi&s;hed to all the Pro|vinces under his Government. What is fairly bought and paid for I make no further Demands about: But if any Lands have been bought of <HI>Indians</HI> to whom the&s;e Lands did not belong, and who had no Right to &s;ell them, I expect a Satisfaction for the&s;e Lands. And if the Proprietaries have taken in more Lands than they bought of true Owners, I expect likewi&s;e to be paid for that. But as the Per&s;ons to whom the Proprietaries may have &s;old the&s;e Lands, which of Right belonged to me, have made &s;ome Settlements, I do not want to di&s;turb them, or to force them to leave them, but I expect a full Satisfaction &s;hall be made to the true Owners for the&s;e Lands, though the Proprietaries, as I &s;aid before, might have bought them from Per&s;ons that had no Right to &s;ell them.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to our Settlement, we intend to &s;ettle at <HI>Wyoming,</HI> and we want to have certain Boundaries fixed between you and us; and a certain Tract of Land fixed, which it &s;hall not be lawful for us or our Children ever to &s;ell, nor for you, or any of your Children, ever to buy. We would have the Boundaries fixed all round, agreeable to the Draught we 
<PB N="10" REF="007921_0010_102E01A7E6265F68">
give you that we may not be pre&s;&s;ed on any Side, but have a certain Country fixed for our own U&s;e, and the U&s;e of our Children for ever.</P>
<P>And as we intend to make a Settlement at <HI>Wyoming,</HI> and to build different Hou&s;es from what we have done heretofore, &s;uch as may la&s;t not only for a little Time, but for our Chil|dren after us; we de&s;ire you will a&s;&s;i&s;t us in making our Settlements, and &s;end us Per&s;ons to in&s;truct us in building Hou&s;es, and in making &s;uch Nece&s;&s;aries as &s;hall be needful; and that Per&s;ons be &s;ent to in&s;truct us in the Chri&s;tian Religion, which may be for our future Wel|fare, and to in&s;truct our Children in Reading and Writing; and that a fair Trade be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed between us, and &s;uch Per&s;ons appointed to conduct and manage the&s;e Affairs as &s;hall be agreeable to us.</P>
<P>I then a&s;ked him, as Fort <HI>Augu&s;ta</HI> was within the Lands he de&s;ired to be a&s;&s;igned to them, whether he would acknowledge that Fortre&s;s to belong to the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for the U&s;e of His Subjects in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and all His other Subjects; and whether he would not be willing it &s;hould continue as a Trading-Hou&s;e, not only for the Good of us the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the Nations he repre&s;ents, but of all the Nations that now are, or may be hereafter, in Al|liance with us; and whether he will not engage, in Conjunction with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to defend it again&s;t any of His Maje&s;ty's Enemies that may come again&s;t it?</P>
<P>To which the King, in Behalf of the Nations he repre&s;ents, replied, That he agrees that that Fort &s;hall belong to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; that it &s;hall continue as a Trading-Hou&s;e; and he and his People, in Conjunction with their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> engage to defend it again&s;t any of His <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty's Enemies that &s;hall come to attack it.</P>

<P><HI>Then the Governor made the following Speech.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyu&s;cung, <HI>and Brethren Sachems and Warriors of the</HI> Ten Nations,</P>
<P>IT gives me Plea&s;ure to hear you declare your Satisfaction at the Appointment our Great King has been plea&s;ed to make of Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> to be the Superintendent of the Affairs of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and that Sir <HI>William</HI> had appointed Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> to be his Deputy; and further, to hear you &s;o fully and openly acknowledge it to be the Duty of both of us to re&s;pect the Per&s;on whom the King has thought fit to entru&s;t with &s;o important a Commi&s;&s;ion. I thank you for the&s;e dutiful Expre&s;&s;ions, and do not in the lea&s;t doubt but they come from the Bottom of your Hearts.&mdash;I a&s;&s;ure you, Brethren, I &s;hall heartily join my Endeavours to yours, that the good Work of Peace, &s;o well begun, may be happily fini&s;hed to our mutual Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ay that the Proceedings of our Ance&s;tors were &s;horter than they ought to have been, in Re&s;pect and Behalf of their Children; and al&s;o of their own everla&s;ting Peace. Bro|ther, our Ance&s;tors of this Province have been always e&s;teemed a good, hone&s;t and wi&s;e Peo|ple, and have always been di&s;tingui&s;hed for their brotherly Love and kind Treatment of the <PB N="11" REF="007921_0011_102E01AA35C2C1A0"><HI>Indians,</HI> and their upright Dealing with them in their Publick Tran&s;actions. You &s;ay that the Cau&s;e of our Differences proceeded from the Land, and advi&s;e us to look &s;trictly into our Hearts for the Truth of this. Brother, we have, according to your De&s;ire, looked into our Hearts, and are not &s;en&s;ible that any of our Tran&s;actions with the <HI>Indians,</HI> either with Re|&s;pect to Land, or otherwi&s;e, could have given Rea&s;on for the unhappy Breach betwen us. You have been &s;o hone&s;t as to declare on all Occa&s;ions, that the Land was not the principal Cau&s;e why you &s;truck us, but was only a Rea&s;on why the Stroke came the harder on us. As then, it was not the Cau&s;e of our fir&s;t Differences, it ought not to be any Ob&s;tacle to an immediate Conclu&s;ion of the Peace, which we are now met together with &s;uch good Intentions to e&s;tabli&s;h. However we may differ in Opinion about Matters of Property, the&s;e are trifling Con&s;iderations, compared to the important Affair of uniting together in the firm Bands of Friend&s;hip. Let us therefore for the pre&s;ent &s;u&s;pend them, and all Matters of le&s;s Mo|ment, and apply our&s;elves in the fir&s;t Place heartily to the Great Work of Peace, &s;o much wi&s;hed for by both of us, and put Things on &s;uch a Footing, that the Great King over the Waters, and His Subjects, and all the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;hall be plea&s;ed with it.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ay, that if you can prevail with us to do you Ju&s;tice in your Complaint about Land, you will then with a loud Voice &s;peak, and the Nations &s;hall hear you. Brother, I mu&s;t now inform you, that immediately after our la&s;t Treaty, I &s;ent to the Proprietaries a Copy of the Complaints you then made of their defrauding you of your Lands, and received their An|&s;wer to it &s;ome Days before I &s;et out to meet you here, wherein they expre&s;s the greate&s;t Con|cern that you, who they conceive have been &s;o well treated both by their Father, <HI>William Penn,</HI> and them&s;elves, &s;hould charge them with Crimes of &s;o heinous a Nature as Fraud and Forgery, by which their Reputation (which to them and every hone&s;t Man is dearer than Life it&s;elf) is &s;o deeply wounded. Your Complaint has likewi&s;e been laid before the King's Mini&s;ters, who, looking upon it as a Matter of great Importance, determined that it &s;hould be carefully enquired into, and examined, before &s;ome Per&s;on no ways concerned in Intere&s;t, on who&s;e Hone&s;ty and Judgment they could depend; and therefore appointed Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> to hear the Particulars of your Charge, and the Proprietary's Defence, and lay the whole Matter before His Maje&s;ty for his Royal Determination, in order that he may do you Ju&s;tice him&s;elf, if you are injured. Our great King looks on you as His Children; and therefore His Mini&s;ters have directed the &s;ame Method to be taken in hearing the Merits of your Complaint, as is u&s;ed among His own Subjects, with this Difference only, that their Di&s;putes are finally &s;ettled by Judges appointed for that Purpo&s;e; whereas, in your Ca&s;e, His Maje&s;ty will determine it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Before I received the Orders of His Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, that your Complaints &s;hould be heard before Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> I fully intended, at this Meeting, to call on the Proprie|taries Agents to an&s;wer the Charge you made again&s;t them, and to have the Matter &s;trictly enquired into; but as I am the King's Servant, and bound by Duty as well as Inclination to obey His Orders, and His Maje&s;ty's Deputy Agent, Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> who is now pre&s;ent, in|forms me he has no Power to &s;uffer any Altercations on this Complaint, and that he does not think it would be for the Good of His Maje&s;ty's Service, I mu&s;t refer you on this Oc|ca&s;ion to Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> to whom I &s;hall &s;end proper Per&s;ons to repre&s;ent the Proprie|taries, with Records, Deeds and Evidences, to &s;hew the Ju&s;tice of their Title at any Time he &s;hall appoint, of which he will give Notice to you, and all Per&s;ons concerned. As that Gentleman is known to be a good Friend to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and a Man of Honour and Integrity, it gives me great Plea&s;ure to find he is well approved of by you, and I do not doubt but you will mo&s;t chearfully agree to leave the Examination of your Claims to him, and concur in the Method His Maje&s;ty has directed for &s;ettling our Differences, in which you will be certain of having &s;trict Ju&s;tice done you.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I could give you many In&s;tances of the great Affection and Regard the Proprietaries have for you, and all the <HI>Indians</HI>; and that they &s;et a far greater Value on your Friend&s;hip, than on any private Intere&s;t or Advantage to them&s;elves; they have lately given to you and the World a mo&s;t convincing Proof of this. You no Doubt have heard, that the Proprietaries, about three Years ago, at a general Meeting of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> held at <HI>Albany,</HI> fairly and openly purcha&s;ed of them a great Country, lying on the We&s;t Side of the River <HI>Sa&s;quehannah;</HI> but upon its being repre&s;ented, that &s;ome of the <HI>Indian</HI> Tribes were di&s;&s;atisfied with the Ex|tent of that Grant beyond the <HI>Allegheny</HI> Hills, the Proprietaries chearfully agreed to &s;urren|der, and give up again to the <HI>Indians,</HI> the Lands We&s;tward of tho&s;e Hills, and have given their Agents Orders to relea&s;e it to them at the propo&s;ed Meeting before Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> and to &s;ettle Boundaries with them.</P>

<P>I have con&s;idered what you &s;aid about a Settlement for your&s;elves and your Po&s;terity, and am informed by Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> that <HI>Wyoming</HI> is the Place you would chu&s;e to &s;ettle at.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Proprietaries have never granted away any Lands, though within the Limits of this Province, without fir&s;t purcha&s;ing them of the <HI>Indians</HI>; and having never bought of them the Lands between <HI>Shamokin</HI> and <HI>Wyoming,</HI> they have therefore never laid Claim to them under any <HI>Indian</HI> Purcha&s;e, and expre&s;ly de&s;ire this may be told to the <HI>Indians,</HI> le&s;t evil-di&s;|po&s;ed Per&s;ons &s;hould have &s;ugge&s;ted any Thing to the contrary; and, in the Name of the Proprietaries, I now di&s;claim all &s;uch Right, of which I would have you take Notice. I am plea&s;ed you have made Choice of that Place; it is perfectly agreeable to me, and I a&s;&s;ure you I will heartily concur with you in u&s;ing all the Means in my Power to have the&s;e Lands &s;ettled upon you and your Po&s;terity, agreeable to your Reque&s;t.

</LIST></P>
<P>Teedyu&s;cung <HI>addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Governor, &s;poke as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother, the Governor,</HI></P>
<P>BY this Belt (holding up a Belt) I remember what you &s;aid Ye&s;terday in the Evening. All was well accepted, and very good, only one Word, or one material Thing. When the &s;everal different Nations of us, that call our&s;elves the <HI>Ten Nations</HI> that are pre&s;ent, I mean the Coun&s;ellors, had con&s;idered what you &s;aid, we approved all except one Thing. Al&s;o this Morning early, when we came to &s;it down by our&s;elves, and our Secretary with us, when we had done, and had fully under&s;tood one another, and agreed on every Word, we then ordered our Secretary to write it down.&mdash;[<HI>John Pump&s;hire</HI> &s;aid, I will ju&s;t mention this in Addition; we ordered him to read it over three or four Times, and approved it.]&mdash;Having done that, we have the Words already written down, and if it plea&s;e the Governor to hear it read, this that is written down is what was concluded on.</P>
<P>The Governor, in An&s;wer, told him, Brother, you know that this is quite a new Me|thod, and was never practi&s;ed before.</P>
<P>Brother, it is true, replied <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> you are right; this was not formerly practi&s;ed; it never u&s;ed to be &s;o. Don't you &s;ee that I aim, by having a Clerk of my own, to exceed my Ance&s;tors, by having every Thing for the be&s;t. I endeavour, according to my Ideas, to look to tho&s;e that have the Authority; as for In&s;tance, if they take up a Handful of Corn or 
<PB N="13" REF="007921_0013_102E01AEEB4BB998">
Pebbles, if they drop any, even one Grain, I will take Notice, and will &s;peak of it, that they may take it up.</P>
<P>The Governor then applied to Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> to know whether this had ever been practi&s;ed in any Treaty; Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> &s;aid it never was, and turning to the King, &s;aid, Brother, this is quite a new Method, and what was never before practi&s;ed. I well know the <HI>Indians</HI> have good memories, and can remember what was tran&s;acted twenty Years ago, as if Ye&s;terday, I &s;hould therefore be glad the King would repeat him&s;elf what he has to &s;ay, as we are only treating with him. Then <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> replied, Well, Brother the Governor, what we have con&s;ulted and concluded on this Morning is this; I remember you told me la&s;t Night, that what was tran&s;acted la&s;t Fall, was laid before the King's Mini&s;ters; and we took parti|cular Notice that you told us, that &s;ome Time before you came from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> you fully intended to make all Satisfaction to me at this Treaty about Lands and Deeds; but that you received a Letter, or Letters, from the King or Proprietaries, I am not certain which, you know be&s;t; in Con&s;equence of which, you told us that you could not act in this Affair, but that Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> was appointed to tran&s;act <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, and Mr. <HI>George Crog|ban</HI> was appointed to act in his Name. We remember very well, when we had a private Conference with you at your Dwelling, that you and Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> ro&s;e up, &s;hock Hands with me, and you told us, this was the very Man that was appointed to act between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> Now, in Con&s;ideration of the&s;e Things, why &s;hould we be obliged to go to Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> to have the Proof of Lands and D eds examined by him, when there is nothing in the Way, the Land Affair not being to be compared with the great Work of Peace, and &s;hould not be any Hindrance to our making a League of Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Now I will give you my Rea&s;ons for not going.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, I do not know Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI>; he may be an hone&s;t and &s;incere Man. We do under&s;tand he treats his <HI>Indians</HI> very well; but we are &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome of the Nations are there that have been in&s;trumental to this Mi&s;under&s;tanding, in &s;elling Lands in this Province, having in former Years u&s;urped that Authority, and called us Women, and threatened to take us by the Foretop, and throw us a&s;ide as Women. But, after a long Space, I believe it is evident, nay, there are Witne&s;&s;es pre&s;ent, who can prove that it is otherwi&s;e. Al&s;o, when I have con&s;idered the&s;e &s;everal Particulars, as you told us there was nothing in the Way to hinder us from confirming a durable and la&s;ting Peace, I at pre&s;ent de&s;ire nothing at all of my Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for my Lands, I only want, for the Satisfaction of the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Ten Nations</HI> pre&s;ent, and al&s;o of all other <HI>Indians,</HI> that the Deeds may be produced, and well looked into; and as you have told me that Mr. <HI>George Croghan</HI> was the Man that would &s;ettle Affairs for our Peace, here he is; I want nothing but to &s;ee the Deeds fairly looked into, and true Copies of them taken and put with the&s;e Minutes now taken. And, after they have been fairly taken down, if you agree to this, then I &s;hall, by two Belts tied together, take you by the Hand, and, with my Uncles, con|firm a la&s;ting Peace with you; and if it plea&s;e the Governor, and Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> let the Co|py of the Deeds be &s;ent to Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> and to the King, and let him judge. I want nothing of the Land till the King hath &s;ent Letters back; then if any of the Lands be found to belong to me, I expect to be paid for it, and not before. Brother, another Rea&s;on for not going is, if we cannot agree to &s;ettle this Affair here, I am afraid the Nations that are watching and looking into what is done here, will have Rea&s;on to think we have not acted an hone&s;t Part, as they expect a real, true and la&s;ting Peace will be &s;ettled here. I am al&s;o concerned on Account of our Women and Children back, and of our Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> on the Frontiers. For the&s;e now pre&s;ent, who it was expected would go Home with great Joy, will go Home with their Finger in their Mouth, as every Body expected this would be the Time of confirming a real and la&s;ting Peace. I told you I would proclaim with a loud Voice, and tho&s;e pre&s;ent are Witne&s;&s;es to what I &s;aid, and will not be ea&s;y if this is not done. I think nothing hinders us at all.</P>
<P>As you told us you had Letters from the King, or Proprietaries, I de&s;ire they may be pro|duced and read, and put down with the Minutes. Now this is the Conclu&s;ion, and in Con|firmation of what I have &s;aid, I give you this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>The King further &s;aid, I de&s;ire al&s;o that a Copy of what pa&s;&s;ed in private between you and me, may be given to be entered with the&s;e Minutes, and that it may be read in publick at our next Meeting.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Meeting was over, I told the Governor, the Good of His Maje&s;ty's Service required, that <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI>'s Reque&s;t of having the Deeds and private Conferences read, and Copies of them given him, with a Copy of &s;o much of the Proprietaries Letters as relates to having the Enquiry made by Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> &s;hould be granted.</P>

<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t con&s;ider, and think it was not the good Spirit that has occa&s;ioned this Di&s;turb|ance; no, it was the evil Spirit that &s;urely occa&s;ioned all this Mi&s;chief, and I hope God will direct us to do every Thing in our Power to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Good Work of Peace, that we may be once more united together, and live in Friend&s;hip, as the good Spirit has ordered us.</P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>I am come here to this Council Fire with our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares</HI> and you, to give all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance I can to the good Work of Peace, and to join my Cou&s;in <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> to gather up the dead Bodies and &s;cattered Bones together, and will join in Prayer to the good Spirit to hide them; and when the Peace is confirmed, I will put both my Hands into the Chain of Friend&s;hip with you, and our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares</HI> and the <HI>Six Nations</HI>; to confirm my Words, I give this String of Wampum.</P>

<P>The Governor told <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> that Five o'Clock Ye&s;terday was appointed for the Time of Meeting; but under&s;tanding that the King was then particularly engaged with &s;ome Friends lately come in, be had deferred meeting them till this Morning.</P>
<P>The Governor &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE well weighed and con&s;idered what you &s;aid to me at our la&s;t Meeting, and am &s;orry you do not incline to go to Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> to have your Complaints &s;trictly en|quired into, and examined by him. It is true Sir <HI>William</HI> has, for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, had a 
<PB N="15" REF="007921_0015_102E01B2CA3F42B0">
general Commi&s;&s;ion from the King to &s;uperintend <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, and that he has given Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> a Power to Act as his Deputy, under which he might have been ju&s;tified in going in|to an Examination as well of your Complaints as the Proprietaries Defence, had not the King's Mini&s;ters lately been plea&s;ed to direct the Hearing to be before Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> him&s;elf. Though you may think your&s;elves at Liberty, and may re&s;u&s;e to comply with the&s;e Directions, yet, as I told you before, I am the King's Servant, and obliged to obey, and can|not take upon me to go into a Defence of the Proprietaries Title at this Time. But as you &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ire to &s;ee the Deeds for the Lands mentioned in your la&s;t Treaty, that you may be &s;atisfied whether they are genuine, or whether the <HI>Indians</HI> who &s;igned them had a Right to &s;ell tho&s;e Lands, I have brought them with me, and am willing to &s;hew them to you now, or at any other Time you will appoint, and give you Copies of them, agreeable to your Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Here the Deeds were laid down on the Table.</P>
<P>And now let all further Debates and Altercations concerning Lands re&s;t here, till they &s;hall be fully examined and looked into by Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> in order to be tran&s;mitted to the King for His Royal Determination.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>After having now gratified you in every rea&s;onable Reque&s;t, and being &s;incerely de&s;irous to re-e&s;tabli&s;h that Friend&s;hip and brotherly Love which &s;o happily &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between your Ance|&s;tors and ours, I am ready, with the King's Deputy Agent, to take hold of the two Belts you mentioned with both my Hands, and confirm a la&s;ting Peace, and exchange them with one prepared for that Purpo&s;e, in the Name of the King of <HI>England,</HI> and all His Subjects, as &s;oon as we can agree upon the Terms.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>The Orders of His Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, on this Occa&s;ion, have been &s;ignified to me by the Proprietaries, which is the proper Channel through which they &s;hould come. That you may the better under&s;tand this, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to inform you, that the Proprietaries are Governors in Chief over this Province, and I am appointed their Deputy, with the Approba|tion of the Crown. When, therefore, the la&s;t Treaty was laid before the King's Mini&s;ters, they gave the Proprietaries Notice of their Re&s;olution, that the Matter &s;hould be heard before Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> only, to whom they would &s;end &s;pecial Directions for that Purpo&s;e. The Proprietaries, for whom I act in this Ca&s;e, have made me acquainted with the Mini&s;ters Or|ders, and de&s;ired me to regulate my Conduct by them. It would have been irregular and improper to have &s;ent the Order it&s;elf to me, but I do not doubt the King's Mini&s;ters have tran&s;mitted it to Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> as an Authority for him to hear and examine our Diffe|rences, and that he has received it before this Time. As I could not &s;u&s;pect that you would have required a Copy of &s;uch of the Proprietaries Letters as relate to this Matter, I did not bring them with me here; wherefore, it is not in my Power to comply with your Re|que&s;t, to furni&s;h you with Copies of them; and to confirm the Truth of this, I give you this Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P>When the Governor had ended his Speech, he a&s;ked the King whether he would have the Deeds read now, and Copies taken. Before the King returned an An&s;wer, he took up the Belt which the Governor had ju&s;t delivered, and ri&s;ing up, &s;poke fir&s;t to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and then to the <HI>Five Nations</HI>; then turning to the Governor, &s;aid,</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>I under&s;tand the Words you have &s;aid here, but they are not agreeable to your Know|ledge, nor a full An&s;wer to what I &s;aid. There are two Things not agreeable.</P>
<P>The Governor &s;aid, Will the King plea&s;e to tell what the&s;e two Things are. No, replied the King, let the Governor find them out. The Governor &s;aid, he did not know what the King meant; he wi&s;hed he knew what An&s;wer to make.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> then &s;aid, If it plea&s;e the Governor, in a few Words, what has been &s;poken on that Belt is as a Rumbling over the Earth, or Confu&s;ion about Lands. I did not want you to make Mention of them, when I expected an An&s;wer in a loving Manner. I wanted you &s;hould come to the main Point, without having &s;o many Words with it.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;eemed very much at a Lo&s;s about the Governor's Speech, I &s;poke to the King, and told him, that the fir&s;t Part of the Governor's Speech was only to inform the King that the Deeds are now produced, and Copies will be given to him, agreeable to his own Reque&s;t, that they may be &s;ent to Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> to be by him tran&s;mitted to the King 
<PB N="16" REF="007921_0016_102E01B4660D4988">
for His Determination. This done, we in the next Place now offer to take hold of the two Belts you mentioned at the la&s;t Meeting: That what was &s;aid about agreeing upon Terms, only referred to the Exchange of Pri&s;oners, and other Things u&s;ual on making Peace; which <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;aid he would do after the Peace was confirmed: That in the Conclu&s;ion of his Speech, the Governor only told the King, that the Proprietaries Letters, for a Copy of which the King a&s;ked, were at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> for which Rea&s;on the Governor could not comply with what the King reque&s;ted, but that an Extract of as much of them as referred to this Affair, will be delivered to me &s;ome Time hence: In Confirmation of which the Governor gave the Belt.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the King heard this, he ro&s;e up, and taking up the two Belts tied together, he &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire you would with Attention hear me. By the&s;e two Belts I will let you know what was the ancient regular Method of confirming a la&s;ting Peace. This you ought to have con&s;idered, and to have done; but I will put you in Mind. You may remember, when you took hold of my Hand, and led me down, and invited my Uncles, &s;everal of whom are pre&s;ent, with &s;ome from each of the <HI>Ten Nations,</HI> when we had agreed we came down to take hold of one of your Hands, and my Uncles came to take hold of the other Hand. Now, as this Day and this Time is appointed to meet and confirm a la&s;ting Peace, we, that is, I and my Uncles, as we &s;tand, and you, as you &s;tand in the Name of the Great King, three of us &s;tanding, we will all look up, and by continuing to ob&s;erve the Agreements by which we &s;hall oblige our&s;elves one to another, we &s;hall &s;ee the clear Light, and Friend&s;hip &s;hall la&s;t to us, and our Po&s;terity after us, for ever. Now, as I have two Belts, and Witne&s;&s;es are pre&s;ent who will &s;peak the &s;ame, by the&s;e Belts, Brothers, in the Pre&s;ence of the <HI>Ten Nations,</HI> who are Witne&s;&s;es, I lay hold of your Hand (taking the Governor by the Hand) and brighten the Chain of Friend&s;hip that &s;hall be la&s;ting; and whatever Conditions &s;hall be proper for us to agree to, may be mentioned afterwards: This is the Time to declare our mutual Friend&s;hip. Now, Brother the Governor, to confirm what I have &s;aid, I have given you my Hand, which you were plea&s;ed to ri&s;e and take hold of; I leave it with you. When you plea&s;e, I am ready. Brother, if you have any Thing to &s;ay as a Token of confirming the Peace, I &s;hall be ready to hear; and as you aro&s;e, I will ri&s;e up, and lay hold of your Hand. To confirm what I have &s;aid, I give you the&s;e Belts. <HI>Gave two Belts tied together.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor &s;aid, that he and I would be ready to give an An&s;wer pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Then the King taking out another Belt, &s;aid, If the Governor plea&s;e, I have a Word or two more to &s;ay to you. In remembering the old ancient Rules of making Friend&s;hip, I re|member I was formerly repre&s;ented as a Woman by my Uncles, the <HI>Six</HI> or <HI>Five Nations</HI>; but they gave me a Pipe, and good Tobacco; tho&s;e pre&s;ent know it to be true; and what I &s;ay is in Behalf of all tho&s;e pre&s;ent, and tho&s;e afar off. That Pipe and good Tobacco of Friend&s;hip, I now deliver to you. Brother, when you &s;hall &s;moke that good Tobacco, it will give you &s;uch a Reli&s;h, that you &s;hall feel it as long as the Sun &s;hines. That very good Tobacco and Pipe that I &s;hall deliver into your Hand, repre&s;ents among us a perpetual Friend|&s;hip. Now I deliver you an equal Part of it, and I de&s;ire it may be a la&s;ting Comfort in this World, and the World to come. <HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>After <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> had confirmed the Peace in Behalf of the <HI>Ten Nations</HI> he repre&s;ents, his Honour the Governor, and my&s;elf, confirmed it in Behalf of the King, and all His Sub|jects, and exchanged the Belts in the following Manner.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyu&s;cung, <HI>and all our Brethren of the</HI> Ten Nations,</P>
<P>We your Brethren, all His Maje&s;ty's Subjects now pre&s;ent, have heard with Satisfaction what you have &s;aid, and with great Plea&s;ure receive the two Belts you have given us, which will confirm a la&s;ting Peace to us and our Po&s;terity, and we embrace this Meeting to ex|change with you a Belt of Friend&s;hip, and take hold of you with one Hand, and of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> with the other, and confirm, in the Name of the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and all His Subjects, a la&s;ting Peace, that may continue as long as the Sun and Moon give Light; and we hope this Day may be always held in Remembrance by our Po&s;terity; and we will be ready to con&s;ult with you at any Time about &s;ettling other Matters, as you your&s;elf have &s;aid. We now ri&s;e and take you into our Arms, and embrace you with the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure as our Friends and Brethren, and heartily de&s;ire we may ever herea&s;ter look on one another as Bre|thren, and Children of the &s;ame Parents: As a Confirmation of this we give you this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a very large white Belt, with the Figures of three Men in it, repre&s;enting His Maje&s;ty King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> taking hold of the <HI>Five Nation</HI> King with one Hand, and <HI>Teedyu&s;|cung,</HI> the <HI>Delaware</HI> King, with the other, and marked with the following Letters and Figure, <HI>G.

This done, the King again a&s;ked the Governor for a Copy of the Conferences that had been held in private, that they might be read in Publick, and entered with the Minutes. The Governor &s;aid it was ready, and &s;hould be delivered immediately, and one was &s;ent for it. The Governor then a&s;ked the King when it would be agreeable to him to have the Deeds read. The King &s;aid, To-morrow Morning, between Seven and Eight a Clock; which Time was accordingly agreed on; and the Reading of the Private Conferences was deferred till that Time.</P>
<P>I think it nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert here the following Speech of <HI>Laboughpeton,</HI> a <HI>Delaware</HI> Chief, made to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> at the Time he &s;eemed at a Lo&s;s about the Governor's Speech to him, which is as follows.</P>
<P>"What, has not our Brother de&s;ired you to bring us down by the Hand to make Peace? why don't you do it? We have been here the&s;e twenty Days, and have heard nothing but &s;colding and di&s;puting about Lands: Settle the Peace, and let all the&s;e Di&s;putes &s;tand till after."</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Meeting was over, I let the Governor know I could not help taking Notice, that there was one Deed relative to tho&s;e Lands wanting, which is mentioned in a Treaty held by this Government with the <HI>Indians</HI> in 1728, &s;aid there to be dated in 1718, and that I expected to &s;ee that Deed, and have a Copy of it; and likewi&s;e Extracts of &s;o much of the Proprietaries Letter to him as relates to the De&s;ire of His Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, &s;ignifying to them, that they ordered the Differences &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them and the <HI>Indians</HI> to be ex|amined by Sir <HI>William John&s;on.</HI> And that as <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> in An&s;wer to a Me&s;&s;age his Ho|nour had &s;ent by Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> to him Ye&s;terday Morning (which will appear as follows) &s;aid, that he would be contented, &s;o he &s;ee all the Deeds relative to the&s;e Back Lands now in Di&s;pute, and have Copies of them, and of the Proprietaries Letter; and further &s;aid, as &s;oon as that was done, he would not &s;ay one Word more about the Di&s;putes about Lands; I then let his Honour know, as <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> had now confirmed the Peace, I expected his Ho|nour would now furni&s;h me with a Copy of that Deed, and the Proprietaries Letter to him.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Ea&s;ton, Augu&s;t</HI> 2, 1757.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Morning <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;ent <HI>Samuel Evans</HI> for me to come to him at Colonel <HI>Wei&s;er's</HI> Lodging: I went there, and found him with five of his Coun&s;ellors, and Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er.</HI> Upon my coming in, Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> told <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> that he wanted to have &s;ome Conver&s;ation with him. <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> a&s;ked him if it was by Order of the Governor. Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> replied, it was by Con&s;ent of the Governor and Council.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> then a&s;ked <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> whether he wanted to &s;ee all the Deeds of the Pro|vince from the fir&s;t Purcha&s;es, or only tho&s;e relating to the Back Lands where we are. Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> &s;aid, the Rea&s;on for his a&s;king was, that he believed the whole of the Deeds were not brought up, but &s;uch only as were thought nece&s;&s;ary, and relating to his Complaint, and the late Purcha&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> an&s;wered, I &s;hould be well plea&s;ed to have &s;een all the Deeds, as the Country to the Sea Shore was fir&s;t ours; but if there be the Deeds for the&s;e Back Lands, which is the main Point, I will be contented, &s;o that I &s;ee them, and have Copies of them, and of the Letters from the King's Mini&s;ters or Proprietaries; as &s;oon as that is done, I will not &s;ay one Word more about the Differences or Lands, but confirm the Peace as &s;oon as that is done.</P>
<P>This Evening the Governor wrote me, that his Letter from the Proprietaries was in <HI>Phi|ladelphia,</HI> Extracts of which he would give me as &s;oon as I went to Town. And he a&s;&s;ured me, that he would give me a Copy of the Deed mentioned in the Treaty of 1728.</P>

<P>THE Conferences held in Council between the Governor and King <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> were produced, and read; and to them was added, by Order of the King, and approved by the Governor, a Paragraph relating to the King's in&s;i&s;ting a &s;econd Time on having a Se|cretary, and the Governor's An&s;wer.</P>
<P>The Deeds &s;hewn Ye&s;terday were again produced, and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> was told, that Mr. <HI>Charles Thomp&s;on,</HI> his Secretary, had got Copies of them, and compared them with the Origi|nals; and was a&s;ked if he cho&s;e to &s;ee the Originals. The King &s;aid, I am &s;atisfied, as my Secretary has &s;een the Copies compared. If he is &s;atisfied that they are true Copies, I am &s;atisfied that they &s;hould be &s;ent to the King for His Determination; then a&s;ked Mr. <HI>Thomp|&s;on</HI> if he had &s;een them compared. Mr. <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI> &s;aid, he had &s;een and compared all the Deeds that were delivered Ye&s;terday.

A Paper Copy of the la&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> Purcha&s;e, 28th of <HI>Sixth Month,</HI> 1686. 2. A Relea&s;e from the <HI>Delaware Indians, Augu&s;t</HI> 25, 1737. 3.

A Deed of Relea&s;e for <HI>Indian</HI> Purcha&s;e, dated the 22d of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1749.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> The above Deeds were &s;hewn in open Council, and Copies of them delivered to <HI>Teedy|u&s;cung,</HI> which his Secretary acknowledged he had compared with the Originals, and that they were true Copies.</P>
<P>When this was done, the Governor &s;poke to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyu&s;cung, <HI>and all our Brethren of the</HI> Ten Nations.</P>
<P>As you and all His Maje&s;ty's Subjects are now united again in the firm Bands of Peace, it is our Duty to do every Thing in our Power to make each other happy; and it was &s;tipulated at the Conferences held at this Place la&s;t Sommer, that all Pri&s;oners you had taken &s;hould be delivered up.</P>
<P>The Relations of tho&s;e who yet remain Pri&s;oners among&s;t you, have their Eyes fixed on me, expecting at my Return to &s;ee their Friends re&s;tored to them; but as few of them are brought down, and this will be a Bar to our Happine&s;s, it is nece&s;&s;ary for you to do every Thing in your Power to re&s;tore to us, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, all our People that remain Pri|&s;oners among&s;t any of your Nations; and to procure tho&s;e who are among any other Tribes in Amity with you, to be &s;ent to us.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>It is a Rule among Nations, upon confirming a Peace, to deliver up all Pri&s;oners on both Sides. It is the only Method we can take to convince each other of our Sincerity; and we do in&s;i&s;t on this being done. You will be &s;o good, immediately on your Return, to convey them down by &s;ome of your young Men, who &s;hall be well rewarded for their Trouble.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>When the Governor had delivered his Speech, and gave the Belt, <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;aid, I will take no other Belt but the very &s;ame I have. Why have you done this now? Why did you 
<PB N="19" REF="007921_0019_102DC827CE82BCA8">
not do it before? After we had fini&s;hed, why do you make any Words about &s;uch Things? This was your Duty; you ought to have done it before. If you really believed I would be faith|ful and hone&s;t, you might be &s;ure I would do it without your delivering a Belt. Now, as you have mentioned the&s;e Things, I al&s;o will mention, that you mu&s;t deliver me my ju&s;t Due about Lands. As you mention that your People look to you, expecting to &s;ee their Relations &s;ent back at this Treaty, &s;o the Nations that lay Claim to the&s;e Lands look to me for them.</P>
<P><HI>Returned the Belt.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor told <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> that he did not do this, as if he had di&s;tru&s;ted his Ho|nour, the King having already given a full Proof of that, by delivering up &s;ome Pri&s;oners. for which he thanked him; that he only meant to put the King in Mind of his Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>I then told <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> that before the Peace was concluded, when I was explaining to him the Governor's Speech, that Part of it where the Governor &s;ays, "as &s;oon as we can agree upon the Terms," related intirely to the Exchange of Pri&s;oners, and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;aid, that &s;hould be &s;ettled afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> then applied to his Secretary, to know if any &s;uch Thing had been mention|ed; and being informed by his Secretary, that it was entered in the Minutes, he (<HI>Teedyu&s;|cung</HI>) then ro&s;e up, and, having fir&s;t con&s;ulted with his own People, and the <HI>Five Nations</HI> &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother, the Governor,</HI></P>
<P>Plea&s;e to hear me in few Words. What you told me I have told to my Uncles the <HI>Six Nations</HI> pre&s;ent, and al&s;o to all the <HI>Ten Nations.</HI> We have con&s;ulted on the&s;e Words that you have now &s;poken: We now think they were very proper, and are very agreeable: We look on it as our Duty: Why &s;hould we keep your Fle&s;h and Blood, or any of your People, when we have agreed as one, and look on one another as one, and treat one another as Bre|thren? After we have all con&s;idered, and all pre&s;ent have heard, we beg your Pardon, that we forgot to give you an An&s;wer immediately. As it was written down by our Clerk in the Minutes Ye&s;terday, it mu&s;t be &s;o; and as we are now &s;en&s;ible this Matter was mentioned Ye&s;terday, we accept your Words, and look on it as our Duty to an&s;wer you, and to per|form; whatever &s;hall be in our Power, we &s;hall endeavour to do. In Confirmation of which I give you my Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Gave the Governor his Hand.</HI></P>
<P>After this Speech the Governor again delivered back the Belt to the King, who readily accepted it.</P>
<P>The Governor then told the <HI>Indians,</HI> that a Pre&s;ent was prepared, and would be delivered to them To-morrow, as a Token of Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>I told <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> that as the Bu&s;ine&s;s was now nearly fini&s;hed with <HI>Onas,</HI> I had &s;omething to &s;ay to him, in the Name of the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that I would let him know when I was to &s;peak to him.</P>
<P>After the Council broke up, the Governor &s;ent for <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and &s;ome of his Coun|&s;ellors, to his Lodgings, from whence we went to Mr. <HI>Vernon</HI>'s, where an hand&s;ome En|tertainment was provided, at which were pre&s;ent, the Governor, his Council, the Speaker, and Members of A&s;&s;embly, the Commi&s;&s;ioners and Gentlemen in Town; the <HI>Delaware</HI> King, his Coun&s;ellors, Warriors, and all the <HI>Indians,</HI> Men, Women and Children, in Number about Three Hundred. After Dinner Peace was proclaimed in Form, and the Proclama|tion interpreted to the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Six Nations</HI>; at the Clo&s;e of which, the Governor, by his Secretary, expre&s;&s;ed his Satisfaction at being one of the happy In&s;truments of bringing about this Peace. His Honour recommended it to all Ranks and Profe&s;&s;ions of Men, to cultivate, to the utmo&s;t of their Power, a good Under&s;tanding with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and to treat them kindly, that they may daily &s;ee the Advantage of pre&s;erving our Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Having given this in Charge to the Freeholders pre&s;ent, be de&s;ired <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> to do the &s;ame to his People, that we might on both Sides forget what was pa&s;t, and live affectionately together for the Time to come. A Detachment of the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> Troops was drawn up in the Front of the Company, and fired three Vollies.</P>
<P>The Governor afterwards continued his Entertainment, at which there was a great Chear|fulne&s;s. At Night was a large Bonfire, and a Variety of <HI>Indian</HI> Dances.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>THIS Morning another Sheet of Council Conferences was produced, which the Go|vernor &s;aid was omitted to be delivered Ye&s;terday; for which Rea&s;on they were de|livered, and publickly read To-day, and ordered to be annexed to the Conferences in Council, delivered and read Ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>After this was read, <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> aro&s;e and &s;aid, Brother, I am obliged to you; I hope, as it lies in your Power, you will act for our mutual Good. I take you as a Brother. When any Thing is omitted, I hope you will mention it to me; and I likewi&s;e will mention any Thing that I find you may have forgotten. I hope we both &s;peak with an hone&s;t Heart. I tru&s;t much to my Interpreter. I thank you for making that Addition, and, in Token of Friend|&s;hip, I give you my Hand.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor then addre&s;&s;ed the</HI> Indians <HI>as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Peace, &s;o happily concluded, gives an univer&s;al Joy. I &s;hall proclaim it far and wide, that all may hear and know it. The People of this Province are di&s;po&s;ed to ob&s;erve it faith|fully, and will do the <HI>Indians</HI> every good Office in their Power.</P>
<P>Altho' we have now &s;o &s;olemnly entered into this Peace with each other, yet you are &s;en|&s;ible there are &s;till many Enemy <HI>Indians,</HI> who are daily doing Mi&s;chief on our Frontiers. Ye&s;terday I received an Account of one Woman's being killed, and four Per&s;ons taken Pri|&s;oners, between <HI>Tolbao</HI> and <HI>Monaidy.</HI> As it will therefore be very difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween our Friends and our Enemies, I &s;hould be glad you would favour me with your Ad|vice how to act in &s;uch a Manner, as not to hurt our Friends, or &s;uffer our Enemies to e&s;cape.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Governor, and People of this Province, ob&s;erve, with a brotherly Compa&s;&s;ion, the many Difficulties to which the <HI>Indians</HI> are expo&s;ed in the&s;e trouble&s;ome Times, and have therefore provided a Quantity of Goods to &s;upply them in their Di&s;tre&s;s. You will, on your Return Home, proclaim the Peace, Union and Friend&s;hip, which is now e&s;tabli&s;hed between us, and let every one know, as you have Opportunity, how well di&s;po&s;ed you have &s;ound us. Accept the&s;e Pre&s;ents, as a Te&s;timony of the &s;incere Affection of us your Brethren towards you.</P>
<P>To <HI>this</HI> Teedyu&s;cung <HI>replied,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am obliged to you for putting me in Remembrance of the&s;e Things. I will take them into Con&s;ideration, and To-morrow, when I am ready to give you an An&s;wer, I will let you know. He further added,</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>There is &s;omething which we intended to &s;ay before, but forgot, as we have not the U&s;e of Writing. But better late than never; we will therefore mention it now. The Copy of the Deeds, and the Tran&s;actions of this Treaty, we entru&s;t to our Clerk. We believe him to be an hone&s;t Man. Every Thing is done to Perfection. We hope you will not be a|gain&s;t his making out a Copy, and giving it to Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Norris,</HI> whom we al&s;o appoint for us, to tran&s;mit to the King a Copy of the Deeds and Minutes of the Treaty, that, if one &s;hould mi&s;earry, the other may go &s;afe.</P>
<P>On which I acquainted <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> that the Governor and my&s;elf had no Objection to Mr. <HI>Norris</HI>'s having true Copies of the Minutes of the&s;e Conferences and Deeds, to &s;end to the King, as he reque&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="007921_0021_102E01BF9455A870">
Then, by Order of the Governor, Proclamation was made, that no One &s;hould cheat, defraud or purcha&s;e any of the Goods now ready to be given to the <HI>Indians,</HI> upon the Pain and Penalties that may fall thereon.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;aid, he had yet one Thing more to mention.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;ome Complaints to make about Lands in the <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> in Behalf of my&s;elf, <HI>John Pump&s;hire, Mo&s;es Tetamy,</HI> and others; which Complaints are contained in the&s;e two Papers: And as you repre&s;ent Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> the King's Agent here, I de&s;ire you may take them under your Con&s;ideration, and &s;ee that Ju&s;tice is done us on that Account, as it is the King's Orders to you, to &s;ee Ju&s;tice done to all the <HI>Indians</HI> in the&s;e Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> then ordered Mr. <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI> to read the Papers, and give me true Copies of them, which he did immediately in publick Council.</P>
<P>The Papers delivered me are, a Copy of an old <HI>Indian</HI> Deed; and a Letter of Complaint about Lands in the <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> &s;igned by <HI>John Pump&s;hire</HI>; I then acquainted him, that I would take the Papers under my Con&s;ideration, and give him an An&s;wer.</P>

<P>THIS Morning I expected to have had a Meeting with the <HI>Indians,</HI> but as the friendly A&s;&s;ociation of <HI>Quakers</HI> had called the <HI>Indians</HI> together, to deliver them a Pre&s;ent, the <HI>Indians</HI> thought proper to put off the Meeting for this Time.</P>
<P>After this the three <HI>Nan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">coke</HI> Me&s;&s;engers came to me, and congratulated the Governor and my&s;elf on the Conclu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on of the Peace, and &s;aid, they had put both their Hands into the Chain of Friend&s;hip, as they were ordered by their Chief before they left Home, and, by a String of Wampum, de&s;ired that the Governor might &s;end &s;ome Per&s;on with them to <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> to take Care of them, and &s;upply them with Nece&s;&s;aries on the Road, as they were come to take the Bones of their Friends which died at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> to their own Town, to be buried with their Relations.</P>

<P>You &s;aid, as &s;oon as the Peace &s;hould be confirmed, that you would &s;peak with a loud Voice, and the Nations around &s;hould hear you. As that good Work is now happily accom|pli&s;hed, I de&s;ire you may proclaim it aloud, that all the Nations may hear it.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that your Brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> are the mo&s;t wealthy and powerful People on this Continent, and not only &s;o, but the be&s;t inclined to help and a&s;&s;i&s;t their Bre|thren the <HI>Indians</HI> with the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life; all this you &s;hould let the Nations know that you &s;peak to; and I a&s;&s;ure you, in the Name of the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and of Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> His Maje&s;ty's &s;ole Agent, and Superintendent of the Affairs of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> their Allies and Dependents, in the Northern Di&s;trict, that they are ready to receive with open Arms all the Nations you &s;hall &s;peak to, that de&s;ire to take hold of the Chain of Friend&s;hip, and be united with the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> you, and us, your Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Papers you delivered me Ye&s;terday, containing your, <HI>John Pump&s;hire, Tundy,</HI> alias <HI>(Mo&s;es) Tetamy,</HI> and others, Complaints of Lands you &s;ay you have been defrauded of in the <HI>Jer&s;eys</HI>; I a&s;&s;ure you I will do every Thing in my Power to have a &s;trict Enquiry made about them, and when I can get the fair State of the Ca&s;e, I will lay it before Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> for him to &s;end to the King for His Royal Determination, unle&s;s the Difference can be &s;et|tled here to your Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To this</HI> Teedyu&s;cung <HI>an&s;wered,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I will, in An&s;wer to what you tell me, let you know what I intend to do. I &s;hall, Bro|ther, as I promi&s;ed to &s;peak with a loud Voice to the Nations, perform my Promi&s;e, and &s;peak to the different Nations. I will faithfully let them know what you have promi&s;ed, and, as we are Witne&s;&s;es that you are wealthy and powerful, and well di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;uch as &s;hall come in as Brothers, I will let them know it. And al&s;o, as I think it is very proper that I &s;hould do &s;o, and as I think it my Duty, whatever Nation I &s;ee coming again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> whenever I &s;ee them, I will make ready, and do every Thing in my Power to vin|dicate the Cau&s;e of my&s;elf, and of my Brethren. If I am able, I will let them go no far|ther than where I tell them to &s;top. If they will not, by rea&s;onable Terms, turn about, and join with me, I will then either make an End of them, or they of me. And if there is a great Number, &s;o that I may not be able to with&s;tand them, I will take all prudent Steps to let my Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> know. And al&s;o, if I perceive that there is &s;o great a Num|ber, that it is not &s;afe for my Women and Children, I will acquaint my Brethren the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> that they may a&s;&s;i&s;t me in defending my Women and Children, and I will leave my Country, and bring them down to you.</P>
<P>Now, you may remember I was &s;tiled by my Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> a Woman in for|mer Years, and had no Hatchet in my Hand, but a Pe&s;tle or Hominy Pounder, but now, Brethren, here are &s;ome of my Uncles, who are pre&s;ent, to witne&s;s the Truth of this; as I had no Tomahawk, and my Uncles were always &s;tiled Men, and had Tomahawks in their Hands, they gave me a Tomahawk. And as my Uncles have given me the Tomahawk, and appointed and authorized me to make Peace with a Tomahawk in my Hand, I take that Tomahawk, and turn the Edge of it again&s;t your Enemies the <HI>French.</HI> In Confirmation of what I now &s;ay, I give you this String.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have ju&s;t a Word or two more. I remember what you have &s;poken, in order that we may prevent any Mi&s;chief, by having a Signal: I &s;hould be glad that the <HI>French</HI> may not deceive us, that not one but &s;everal Signs and Methods may be fixed on by you. And whatever you &s;hall think proper, I will agree to.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>I then returned <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> Thanks for his kind Speech, and let him know that I would con&s;ult with the Governor about &s;ettling the Signals, and would give him an An&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="007921_0023_102E01C5220C8998">
<HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> then taking up four Belts, and a String, &s;poke to his Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> telling them, that as they had empowered him, he had, in the Pre&s;ence of the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es they had &s;ent, made a firm Peace with their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; he, therefore, by the&s;e Belts de&s;ired, that they would perform their Part; and as they &s;aid they would take hold of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by one Hand, and he by the other, he had now done it. And as the Chain of Friend&s;hip was now brightened, he de&s;ired they would be &s;trong, and if they &s;ee any Ene|mies coming again&s;t us, they would look on it, that whoever &s;trikes any one of us &s;trikes all. The&s;e Belts he gave to <HI>Anaquateeka,</HI> and de&s;ired he would carry them to the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> then acquainted me that he had done; whereupon <HI>Pack&s;ino&s;a</HI> &s;poke to me as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I heartily thank you for being &s;o kind as to wipe the Sweat from our Faces, picking out the Briars, and taking away all bad Thoughts from our Minds, and cleaning the Pa&s;&s;age from the Heart to the Throat, that we may &s;ee our Brethren, and be well from all our Wounds. By the&s;e Strings we return you Thanks.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame he &s;aid by another String to the <HI>Six Nations</HI> and <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>
<P>Then the young Warrior, <HI>Anaquateeka,</HI> aro&s;e, and, directing his Speech to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and his Cou&s;ins, &s;aid,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>My Cou&s;ins have entru&s;ted me with all that was here tran&s;acted, re&s;pecting the great Work of Peace here confirmed, to lay it before the <HI>Six Nations.</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you I will execute the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me with Faithfulne&s;s, and lay it before the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> particularly before the <HI>Senecas,</HI> to whom I belong. I do not pretend to be a Coun&s;ellor: I am a young War|rior; yet the Affairs of War and Peace belong to us Warriors: And as I am entru&s;ted, I a&s;&s;ure you I will take Care that all the <HI>Six Nations</HI> may know what is here done.</P>
<P>Then his Honour the Governor, Mr. <HI>Logan,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peters,</HI> came into Council. I ac|quainted the Governor, that I thought it was proper what had been tran&s;acted this Morning &s;hould be read, and it was accordingly done; after which the Governor addre&s;&s;ed <HI>Pack&s;ino|&s;a</HI> as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Pack&s;ino&s;a,</P>
<P>You have been frequently invited by this Government to come and give us the Plea&s;ure of a Vi&s;it. I am glad to &s;ee you, I take you by the Hand, and bid you heartily welcome, and thank you for bringing along with you <HI>Abraham,</HI> the <HI>Mohiccon</HI> Chief; he is likewi&s;e extremely welcome.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have often enquired after you, and always heard you continued to be our hearty Friend, and a Lover of Peace. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>William John&s;on</HI> was kind enough to &s;end me an Account of the Conferences he lately held <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> you at <HI>Fort John&s;on,</HI> and they gave me great Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>With Plea&s;ure I acquaint you, that Peace is now concluded, and it will add much to the Joy all feel on this &s;ucce&s;sful I&s;&s;ue of our Conferences; and I am glad to &s;ee you and <HI>Abra|ham</HI> here to take hold of the Peace Belt.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We were in Hopes to have &s;een you with <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> when he came here. We heard you was not come, but would follow: I have &s;taid &s;ome Time in Expectation of your Ar|rival. I &s;hould have been glad to have &s;pent more Time with you, but the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Government obliges me to return to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> this Afternoon, &s;o that you will plea&s;e to u&s;e Di&s;patch in letting me know any Thing you may have to &s;ay to us.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed this Speech, the Governor told <HI>Pack&s;ino&s;a,</HI> that &s;ome Pre&s;ents were re|&s;erved for him and his Friends, which &s;hould be delivered pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Teedyu&s;cung <HI>then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Governor, &s;poke as follows</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have a Word or two more to &s;ay. You know when you employ your Soldiers, they are paid for their Services. As I am joined with you, you being rich, and I poor, as I am going again&s;t your Enemies, and carrying my Fle&s;h again&s;t them, I think it would be proper, for the En|couragement of my young Men, to appoint &s;ome Reward for Scalps, and Pri&s;oners, and that &s;ome Place may be fixed, where the Scalps and Pri&s;oners may be brought in, and the Reward received, that my Men may return quickly from thence.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="007921_0024_102E01C7B8B9DDA8">
Then the Governor &s;aid, he would take into Con&s;ideration what he, <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> had &s;aid, and in Half an Hour would return an An&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> further added; You may remember, when I mentioned <HI>I&s;aac Norris,</HI> the Speaker, I mentioned him alone; but I did not intend to mention him alone, but that he, with the A&s;&s;embly, &s;hould look into it, and &s;end Copies Home.&mdash;I then told <HI>Teedyu&s;|cung,</HI> that I had no Objection to Mr. <HI>Norris,</HI> with the A&s;&s;embly, &s;ending authentick Copies of the Minutes of this Treaty, and Deeds, Home.</P>

<P>Teedyu&s;cung <HI>addre&s;&s;ed the Governor as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>WE have now fini&s;hed. The Treaty is over. Peace is confirmed. I told you I thought of going to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but upon con&s;idering the Matter with more At|tention, I think it will be more for the publick Service if I proceed immediately to <HI>Diahogo:</HI> Many Nations will be unea&s;y to know what has been done at this Council-Fire, and will take their Mea&s;ures accordingly; I &s;hall therefore make the be&s;t of my Way to <HI>Diahogo,</HI> and proclaim there, and to Nations &s;till more di&s;tant, the Confirmation of the Peace with our Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> This will take up three or four Months; after which I may perhaps come and &s;ee you at <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> I wi&s;h the Governor a good Journey, and that we may both live to enjoy the Fruits of this happy Peace, which gives my People great Joy.</P>
<P><HI>To which the Governor returned the following An&s;wer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyu&s;cung,</P>
<P>It gives me great Plea&s;ure that we have brought the important Bu&s;ine&s;s we met about to &s;o happy an I&s;&s;ue. You have very agreeably prevented my mentioning to you the Nece&s;&s;ity of your returning Home, in order to publi&s;h to the <HI>Indians</HI> what has been tran&s;acted here. I thank you for the Change of your Purpo&s;e: It is a further Sign of your Zeal for Peace, and I make no Doubt but you will u&s;e your utmo&s;t Di&s;patch.</P>
<P>In An&s;wer to what you reque&s;ted this Morning, I a&s;&s;ure you that your Warriors will al|ways find this Government ready to reward them for any Services they &s;hall do again&s;t the Enemy. I cannot at pre&s;ent give you a more particular An&s;wer, but &s;hall lay your Propo&s;als before the A&s;&s;embly, who meet To-morrow, and con&s;ult with them thereupon.</P>
<P>Teedyu&s;cung <HI>replied.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother, the Governor,</HI></P>
<P>You have not &s;o much as given us a ru&s;ty Iron to defend our&s;elves. If we meet an Ene|my on the Road, what are we to do? We cannot defend our&s;elves again&s;t him. We have nothing to do it with. Our young Warriors think as much of them&s;elves, and their Lives are as dear to them as white People's. But you have not given them any Encouragement to go again&s;t the Enemy. Can this be right? You know you have not. Con&s;ider this well Brother.</P>
<P>Further, Brother, I think it proper to tell you, if <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hall go to War to|gether, my young Men will not be &s;ubject to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captain; and if any of your People will go to War with me, I expect they will be &s;ubject to my Directions: We under&s;tand our own Way of Fighting better than you.</P>
<P>The Governor then &s;aid he had given Directions to Colonel <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> to agree with him on proper Signals for the <HI>Indians,</HI> when they were coming towards the inhabited Parts of this Province, as this was a Matter that ought not to be &s;poke of in Publick.</P>
<P>They then took a kind Leave of each other, and the Governor &s;et out for <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
