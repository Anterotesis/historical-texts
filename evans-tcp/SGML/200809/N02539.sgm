<P>And Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SINGULAR in the <HI>Old World</HI> was the <HI>Per|&s;on</HI> and the <HI>Thing</HI> here &s;poken of; the holy <HI>Life</HI> and the happy <HI>End</HI> of ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Enoch.</HI> He was the mo&s;t remarkable and di&s;tingui&s;hed among the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> before the Flood; for his eminent Godline&s;s &amp; excelling Piety; for his &s;hort and fervent Life, and God's taking him to Heaven without &s;eeing Death. He was a Man of God, a zealous Prophet of the Lord, and preach'd earne&s;tly to the &s;inners in his day of the Coming of Chri&s;t to Judg|ment <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Jude v.</HI> 14, 15.</NOTE>. And God rewarded his excelling &s;aith, &s;anctity &amp; labours, with a di&s;tingui&s;hing <HI>Exit,</HI> or departure hence.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003011_0004_0FEF9EDA8A68F678">
MY <HI>Text</HI> &s;peaks <HI>three</HI> things of him, That he <HI>walked with GOD,</HI> that he <HI>was not,</HI> that <HI>God took him.</HI> It is a &s;hort Record of three very great and copious things; of his heavenly life on earth and of his glorious removal to a bet|ter World.</P>
<P>THAT he <HI>was not</HI> means not that <HI>he died;</HI> but the contrary, that he <HI>died not.</HI> The Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> tells us how God took him, Heb. 11.5. <HI>By faith Enoch was tran&s;lated that he &s;hould not &s;ee death, and was not found becau&s;e God had tran&s;lated him: for before his tran&s;lation he had this te&s;timony that he plea&s;ed God.</HI> Walking with God is the thing that <HI>plea&s;es</HI> him. This is the fruit and evidence of the <HI>Faith</HI> of God's Elect. They that <HI>walk</HI> with God in this world, he will in a little while <HI>take</HI> to him&s;elf in a better life.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Enochs</HI> walk with God was in &s;uch a &s;ingular manner, and was &s;o &s;ingularly plea&s;ing to Him, that God di&s;tingui&s;hed him from the re&s;t of Mortals, and the <HI>Angels</HI> of God took him up in the body, as they did <HI>Elias</HI> afterward, and as they do the Souls of other Believers now, and carried him to the Pre&s;ence and Pa|radi&s;e of God.</P>
<P>THIS mu&s;t be re&s;olved into the Good plea|&s;ure of God, his wi&s;e and Sovereign will; and to be &s;ure it was not for any Merit or de&s;ert in <HI>Enochs</HI> holy walking with God. <HI>Enoch</HI> de|&s;erv'd to have died for his Sins, as well as any before or after him. He was born in &s;in as well as other Sons of <HI>Adam,</HI> and cou'd never &s;ay I am pure from &s;in till his glorious Change
<PB N="3" REF="003011_0005_0FEF9EDC45FD0520">pa&s;s'd on him, as he was caught up. <HI>Elias</HI> was a Man of like <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> with others, and ask'd to <HI>die;</HI> yet he was tran&s;lated as well as <HI>Enoch.</HI> It was not due to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of either that they were taken without &s;eeing Death. Before that God formed them in the belly, he de&s;ign'd them their <HI>Tran&s;lation.</HI></P>
<P>Never the le&s;s God doubtle&s;s meant hereby to put eminent honour on &s;ingular Piety, and to excite others to labour after Eminence there|in. So God crowns his own Work, his own Gift. <HI>The Lord is well plea&s;ed in his own Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in his Saints, and for his own Names &s;ake magnifies and honours it. Singular Zeal, Diligence and Devotion in degenerate times &s;hall receive a di&s;tingui&s;hing Reward. As <HI>Elias</HI> was <HI>alone</HI> in the cau&s;e of God in a mo&s;t corrupt time, &s;o in <HI>Enochs</HI> day the flood of In|fidelity &amp; Impiety begun to break in upon the old World.</P>
<P>THEN God &s;aw it a fit time to give Mankind an <HI>Ocular</HI> Te&s;timony of that Eternal Life which he has prepared for them that love and plea&s;e him. <HI>Adam</HI> was but ju&s;t dead, as it were, be|fore the Tran&s;lation of <HI>Enoch;</HI> and &s;ome think that <HI>Adam</HI> him&s;elf was the fir&s;t In&s;tance of a <HI>natural</HI> death; (for as to <HI>Abel</HI> he died a <HI>violent</HI> one) and the World by rea&s;on of the rarity of Death and the long life of Mankind might grow into a &s;trange degree of unbelief, profane&s;s, &s;en&s;uality &amp; inju&s;tice before the death of <HI>Adam.</HI> Now I take <HI>Enochs</HI> tran&s;lation to have been meant and order'd by God as a Te&s;timony to the very Sen&s;es and common Under&s;tanding of
<PB N="4" REF="003011_0006_0FEF9EE324072118">the Men of the <HI>Old World, Fir&s;t,</HI> that there is a ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Immortality</HI> for pious and holy Per&s;ons in an un&s;een and eternal World; <HI>Secondly,</HI> that they &s;hall live and be ble&s;&s;ed there both in <HI>body and &s;oul</HI> united; and con&s;equently <HI>Thirdly,</HI> that there &s;hall certainly be a <HI>Re&s;ur|rection</HI> of the Bodies of <HI>Saints</HI> to a ble&s;&s;ed Life and glorious Immortality.</P>
<P>NOT that I think the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> before <HI>Enoch</HI> were without the Doctrine and Hope of the <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> of the body: I believe much the contrary, namely, that God revealed this to <HI>Adam,</HI> and that <HI>Enoch</HI> had walked in <HI>this</HI> Faith, Others before him, But the World, now a thou&s;and year <HI>old</HI> in &s;in, began to langui&s;h un|der a mi&s;erable decay of <HI>Faith,</HI> and needed &s;ome remarkable <HI>Testimony</HI> from Heaven to the Doctrine of a future Life and the Re&s;urrection of the Body.</P>
<P>AND as to <HI>Enoch's</HI> being taken <HI>&s;o &s;oon</HI> from his holy walk on earth to the heavenly World; for he lived not <HI>half</HI> the days of <HI>Adam,</HI> or his other gracious <HI>Progenitors,</HI> I might &s;ugge&s;t,</P>
<P>THAT God hereby te&s;tified his <HI>delight</HI> in <HI>early</HI> Piety, diligence and proficiency; That he poured <HI>contempt</HI> upon <HI>long</HI> life on earth, in compari&s;on of the Eternal Glory; That he let the other <HI>Patriarchs</HI> and holy Men &s;ee that eight or nine hundred years here was not the <HI>right,</HI> the privilege not reward of their emi|nent Piety; and that they &s;hould by no means <HI>depend</HI> on it or <HI>take up</HI> with it. In a word, <HI>Enochs</HI> tran&s;lation was the more like to be taken notice of in the Age that then was, by
<PB N="5" REF="003011_0007_0FEF9EE06F56BA88">his being tran&s;lated <HI>young.</HI> If he had liv'd his nine hundred years it is likely the thing had been le&s;s ob&s;erved and talked of and laid to heart.</P>
<P>SOME <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. <HI>Boys</HI> of <HI>Dublin.</HI></NOTE> have ob&s;erved that as <HI>Enoch</HI> was the <HI>&s;eventh</HI> from <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;o <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>five</HI> more were &s;ubjected to natural death, but He the &s;eventh was tran&s;lated, to point out to us the <HI>Time</HI> when the ble&s;&s;ed Re&s;urrection of the Ju&s;t might be expected: Soil. That as Death &s;hould reign over the race of <HI>Adam</HI> for <HI>&s;ix thou|&s;and</HI> years, &s;o the <HI>&s;eventh</HI> would re&s;tore all the <HI>&s;piritual &s;eed</HI> of the <HI>&s;econd Adam</HI> to a &s;tate of glorious Immortality.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> ob&s;erves, That <HI>Enoch</HI> liv'd ju&s;t a <HI>Year of years,</HI> which as Men liv'd then was to go in the <HI>midst</HI> of his days; for the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> before the Flood did more than <HI>double</HI> that Age; and God took them &s;o &s;oon becau&s;e the World was grown corrupt and was unworthy of him; or becau&s;e he was &s;o much above the World and weary of it, and de&s;irous of a &s;peedy removal out of it: Or becau&s;e his Work was done, and done the &s;ooner for his minding it &s;o clo&s;ely. God often takes them &s;oone&s;t whom he loves be&s;t, and the time they lo&s;e on earth is gained in heaven, to their un&s;peakable advantage.</P>
<P>I have held you too long it may be on the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> and <HI>Thing</HI> in the <HI>Text,</HI> the Patriarch <HI>Enoch</HI> and his glorious <HI>Tran&s;lation.</HI> The plain <HI>Doctrinal Ob&s;ervation</HI> I &s;hall now &s;peak to is this,</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003011_0008_0FEF9EE5F161A9A0">
DOCT. <HI>THAT God will undoubtedly take tho&s;e to Him&s;elf in another and better World, that walk with Him in this World.</HI> As he did by <HI>Enoch</HI> who prophe&s;ied of the Coming of CHRIST in the great Day, &s;o he will by all others that look and wait for his Appearing. In <HI>Enochs</HI> character and reward, all Men may learn their duty, and Saints their property &amp; priviledge.</P>
<P><HI>HE walked with God:</HI> He &s;et God always be|fore him; kept his eye continually upon God, and con&s;ider'd him&s;elf always under the eye of God; ob&s;erv'd by him and accountable to him. He was a follower and imitator of the ble&s;&s;ed God, &s;tudied his glorious Nature &amp; Perfecti|ons and his holy Will, and conform'd his heart and life to both, as far as he could attain. He made it his con&s;tant care and bu&s;ine&s;s to <HI>plea&s;e</HI> God, for can two <HI>walk</HI> together except they are agreed? He was wholly devoted to the Service of God, and the Felicity he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf was Communion with God here and the Enjoyment of him for ever. He did not walk after the cour&s;e of this world, with the men of that wicked age; No, but contrary to them; his fellow&s;hip was with the <HI>Sons of God,</HI> in whom was all his delight, and among whom he &s;hone a burning light. He preach'd again&s;t the wickedne&s;s that then began to prevail over the earth with great zeal and courage, and warn'd them of the <HI>Day</HI> when God wou'd judge 'em for their <HI>ungodly deeds.</HI> Thus he <HI>walked</HI> with God, exerci&s;ing him&s;elf unto Godline&s;s, and making Religion the bu&s;ine&s;s and joy of
<PB N="7" REF="003011_0009_0FEF9EE8738F0150">his life, God's glory his ruling End, and his own Salvation his great and chief care.</P>
<P>IN all this <HI>we</HI> mu&s;t take him for our <HI>Exam|ple,</HI> to walk even as he walked; in the &s;ame <HI>Spirit</HI> and in the &s;ame <HI>Stops.</HI> &mdash; We mu&s;t walk by <HI>Faith</HI> as <HI>Enoch</HI> did, by which the Ju&s;t do live, and without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God. So <HI>Abraham</HI> walked <HI>before</HI> God and was perfect, and &s;o <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> walked as &s;ee|ing him that is Invi&s;ible, and having re&s;pect to the Recompence of Reward. &mdash;</P>
<P>BY <HI>Repentance</HI> we mu&s;t return to God, and walk humbly with him, the wicked and impe|nitent are walking contrary to God, and he walks <HI>contrary</HI> to them. But how did the <HI>Son of God</HI> on earth &s;eek out humble <HI>Penitents,</HI> walk and conver&s;e with them, and joy in them?&mdash;To walk as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> walked is indeed to walk with God. He always did tho&s;e things that plea&s;ed the <HI>Father,</HI> who&s;e Soul was ever highly plea&s;ed in him. He has given us an Example that we &s;hould follow his &s;teps. &mdash;We mu&s;t walk with God in the daily and continual du|ties of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> in all &s;tated and oc|ca&s;ional Exerci&s;es of religious <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> &s;olitary and &s;ocial, private and publick. We mu&s;t walk with God in our <HI>Clo&s;ets,</HI> with our <HI>Fami|lies,</HI> and in <HI>God's</HI> hou&s;e, in all his <HI>Ordi|nances,</HI> blamele&s;s. &mdash; To walk with God means, in <HI>all</HI> the parts and in&s;tances of a &s;ober, righteous and godly Life; and con&s;tancy therein all our days. We walk with God in a &s;incere, univer&s;al and per&s;evering <HI>Obedi|ence</HI> to the written Word and revealed Law of
<PB N="8" REF="003011_0010_0FEF9EEC896EE6D8">God: And <HI>ble&s;&s;ed are the undefiled in the way that walk in the Law of the Lord.</HI> We walk with God in a reverential <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> to him in all his Providences. Then God is with us and &s;ays to us, <HI>When thou pa&s;&s;est thro</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The Office &amp; Work of the Holy Spirit <HI>from p. 237.</HI></NOTE> <HI>the Waters I am with thee.</HI> It is good having God with us when our way is cloudy and dark, and in the night of afflictions, going before us, holding us up, leading us on, and keeping us &s;afe. When the three <HI>Worthies</HI> were thrown into the flam|ing furnace the Son of God came down and walked there with them. &mdash; Indeed to walk with God is a Phra&s;e that &s;peaks <HI>Eminence</HI> in Religion; but it e&s;pecially &amp; &s;trongly implies <HI>Progre&s;s,</HI> proficiency and per&s;everance in every thing that is holy ju&s;t and good. To <HI>walk</HI> is not to take a <HI>&s;tep</HI> or too, nor is it for a <HI>day</HI> or a year, but for the whole life, <HI>all</HI> our days. We mu&s;t walk and work while the day la&s;ts; the light is given for this. The way is but &s;hort, a few &s;teps up-hill, in a &s;trait &amp; narrow path, that leads to eternal life. We read of <HI>Walking in the Spirit,</HI> Gal. 5.25. That is to walk with God: <Q>A <HI>Spiritual</HI> life; the mo&s;t excellent and <HI>noble</HI> kind of life, under the continual vital Influence of the <HI>Holy Spirit?</HI></Q> This <HI>walking</HI> (&s;ays the Rev. Mr. <HI>How</HI> on that <HI>Text</HI>) doth more directly and formally denote a <HI>&s;elf-motion,</HI> a <HI>voluntary</HI> motion, an <HI>orderly</HI> mo|tion, a <HI>plea&s;urable</HI> motion, a <HI>continued</HI> and <HI>pro|gre&s;&s;ive</HI> motion. This can only be in the <HI>light</HI> of the Spirit, and in his <HI>power.</HI> Hence in the progre&s;s in <HI>Spirituality</HI> Thus How.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003011_0011_0FEF9EF1170DE6B8">
AND now let us con&s;ider, What an <HI>honnara|ble</HI> thing this is, to walk with God! What an honour &s;hould we account it, if our earthly <HI>Prince</HI> would allow us to walk after him in his Garden? Only a few &s;elect and favourite <HI>Nobles</HI> have the honour done them. What the is <HI>Man,</HI> that God magnifies him in &s;peak|ing of <HI>his</HI> walking with <HI>the King Eternal, Immor|tal, Invi&s;ible!</HI> Will God in very deed walk with <HI>us</HI> on earth? Behold Heaven, and the Heaven of heavens cannot contain him?</P>
<P>How <HI>pea&s;ant</HI> mu&s;t this be, to walk with GOD? Such was <HI>Eden,</HI> the Garden of God, in man's fir&s;t &s;tare; and &s;uch is the <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> of God above. Such are all the ways of Wi&s;|dom and Holine&s;s, <HI>ways of plea&s;antne&s;s &amp; paths of peace.</HI></P>
<P>How <HI>&s;afe</HI> and &s;ecure mu&s;t they be that walk with God? guarded by his Power, cover'd with his Wing, protected by his Providence, and de&s;ended by his Angels: As <HI>Jacob</HI> on his way when God's <HI>Ho&s;ts</HI> met him. O the Secu|rity and Serenity of this way! living &amp; dying &s;uch are &s;afe.</P>
<P>YEA everla&s;tingly happy and <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> are all &s;uch in the World to come. They are going to God, to be with him, and ble&s;&s;ed in him, for ever and ever: Going where <HI>Enoch</HI> is, and to be as <HI>be</HI> is: Not indeed as he went, without dying, but it is all one in the end, at the Re|&s;urrection: <HI>Gohriel,</HI> and <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &amp; <HI>Elias</HI> there walk together. In the pre&s;ence of CHRIST; and are one in Line, Glory and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003011_0012_0FEF9EF306D83280">
BUT this leads me into the <HI>Proof</HI> of the Doctrine, That if we do walk with God here in this life, <HI>he will take as to him&s;elf for ever.</HI> As truly as he took <HI>Enoch,</HI> &s;o will he all them that walk in <HI>Enoch</HI>'s faith and piety. It will be &s;hortly &s;aid of every one of them, <HI>He is not, for God took him.</HI> Took him! whither? why where he took <HI>Enoch,</HI> up to him&s;elf in heaven. As truly as <HI>Enoch</HI> is there, you &s;hall be &s;hortly there al&s;o if you walk with God.</P>
<P>To &s;tate this ea&s;y <HI>Truth</HI> it mu&s;t be &s;aid,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>NOT bodily</HI> and alive to heaven, without &s;eeing and ta&s;ting death, as <HI>Enoch</HI> was taken. No &s;uch matter; and it matters not much. The Godly die as well as others. <HI>Two</HI> only of the Saints have been tran&s;lated, one before the Flood, and one under the Law; and for Go&s;pel days the Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion of our <HI>Lord Je&s;us</HI> may abundantly &s;uffice, to &s;trengthen and uphold the faith of Saints. That glorious <HI>Son of man</HI> became obe|dient to death for the &s;ake of his Elect, to teach them to expect a di&s;&s;olution, and how to pa&s;s comfortably as well as holily thro' it, hav|ing the &s;ting of it taken away by his dying. He died not to purcha&s;e for them a Tran&s;lation; no, but a Re&s;urrection. Every Saint may take up <HI>Jobs</HI> words, and &s;ay to God with holy Sub|mi&s;&s;ion; Job. 30 23. <HI>For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, the hou&s;e appointed for all the living.</HI> But altho' no Saint looks to be taken bodily to heaven, as <HI>Enoch</HI> was without &s;eeing death, yet</P>

2. GOD takes the <HI>Souls</HI> of them to him&s;elf at death, who have walked with him in this life. The <HI>Soul</HI> is the Per&s;on; if that be taken up to God it matters not tho' the body be laid for a time in the earth, Eccl. 12.7. <HI>The body returns to the earth as it was, but the &s;pirit returns to God that gave it.</HI> The <HI>Spirits of the ju&s;t made perfect</HI> are in the &s;ame Heaven, the &s;ame Para|di&s;e, where <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> are in their Spiri|tual bodies. Thither the Angels carried the Soul of the gracious beggar, <HI>Lazarus,</HI> when he died at the rich man's <HI>gate:</HI> And thither they carried the happy Spirit of the penitent <HI>thief,</HI> when it left the body upon a <HI>cro&s;s;</HI> And thither the holy Soul of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> went for the three days that he left his body in the <HI>grave:</HI> To his <HI>Fa|ther</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>Intothy hand I commit my Spirit.</HI>&mdash; So God took <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &amp; <HI>Aaron</HI> from the Mount in the day they were uncloath'd and buried; and &s;o <HI>Je&s;us</HI> took the Soul of <HI>Stephen</HI> while the brui&s;ed fle&s;h fell under the cruel &s;tones.

<P>GOD as truly takes the <HI>Soul</HI> by dying and at death, as he took <HI>Enoch</HI> without &s;eeing death. If the <HI>Soul</HI> be but taken to the Regions of the Ble&s;&s;ed all is well, wherever the <HI>body</HI> be dropt, in the &s;ea, or on the dry land.

<PB N="13" REF="003011_0015_0FEF9EFD28AB6850">Compare here the &s;tate and privilege of re|deemed Saints in the Re&s;urrection day: Some will have the &s;ingular privilege of not dying, not &s;leeping: The re&s;t have all fallen a&s;leep in Chri&s;t, and have undergone the change of death.

His <HI>Vi&s;its</HI> to his Friends, and theirs to him, bear witne&s;s for him how much the Love of Chri&s;t was in his Heart and on his Tongue. Much more his more religious Vi&s;its to the <HI>Sick</HI> and Afflicted, to the Bereaved and to <HI>Mourners,</HI> to the <HI>Tempted</HI> and wounded in Spirit, or theirs to Him, may be &s;uppos'd to bear witne&s;s for him. Not to omit his many charitable Vi&s;its to <HI>Pri&s;oners</HI> under the Sentence of death, and his <HI>Labours</HI> with them, to &s;ave their Souls from the &s;econd Death.</P>
<P>IF we follow him to his <HI>public</HI> Labours, &s;tated and occa&s;ional, on <HI>Lord's Days &amp; Lectures;</HI> how &s;ervent was he and unwearied, in Prayer and Preaching, in Interce&s;&s;ions and Exhortations? Here he &s;how'd a flaming Love to <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Souls,</HI> and a vehement zeal again&s;t <HI>Sin</HI> and for <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Holine&s;s.</HI> Among the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> in all their Meetings, he was very much the Mouth of <HI>God</HI> to them as well as <HI>theirs</HI> to God. The whole <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of God, his Cau&s;e and Intere&s;t in a wicked World, lay always much upon his heart, and &s;o did the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> the Civil and Religious Liberties of <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI> and tho&s;e of his own <HI>Country.</HI> He truly lov'd his <HI>People,</HI> and had ju&s;t notions of their true Intere&s;ts. He was in the <HI>Gap</HI> for them on all Occa&s;ions, and wre&s;tled in Prayer. He was a zealous Adorer and A&s;&s;ertor of the <HI>God-head of Christ;</HI> all his <HI>hope</HI> of Salvation &s;tanding on it, and the whole <HI>My&s;tery of Godline&s;s.</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="26" REF="003011_0028_0FEF9F2209F74500">His <HI>Re&s;ignations</HI> to the Will of God were won|derful under great Trials; and it &s;eem'd one of the chief A&s;pirations of his Soul to honour God by <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> and to have his own <HI>Will</HI> &s;wallowed up entirely in the Will of God. This he pre&s;s'd vehemently on others in an evil and <HI>dying</HI> World, and this he practic'd him&s;elf. One of the <HI>la&s;t</HI> Words I heard him &s;peak was in Admiration of the Grace of God in &s;ome of his near <HI>Relatives,</HI> in their exemplary Patience, Re&s;ignation and Devotion, under a great and &s;ore <HI>Bereavement:</HI> He lift up his feeble Hand, and rais'd his &s;unk Voice, and earne&s;tly &s;aid with a faultring Tongue, <HI>"O they do gloriou&s;ly, they do gloriou&s;ly, to honour God as they do with &s;uch a &s;acrificing Spirit".</HI> He &s;ought not this <HI>World,</HI> but was very <HI>liberal</HI> of his lit|tle, in u&s;es of Piety and Charity. His heart was too good and big for <HI>earthly</HI> things, and too &s;piritual not to be &s;et on <HI>higher</HI> and better; namely <HI>a more enduring Sub&s;tance, a Trea&s;ure in Heaven that faileth not.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING was more familiar and frequent with him than <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Eternity.</HI> The&s;e he was ever &s;peaking of with <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> and de&s;ire, as one always <HI>ready</HI> and willing to be offer'd. And agreably he entertain'd all his <HI>Sickne&s;&s;es</HI> with Con&s;tancy and Serenity, Tranquility and Peace; not &s;haken in mind nor afraid to die. He told me on the la&s;t <HI>Lord's-Day</HI> in the Even|ing, with what a <HI>&s;ingular Satisfaction</HI> he had received the notice of Deaths approach that <HI>Morning,</HI> hoping to have been with Chri&s;t that <HI>Sacrament-day.</HI></P>

I &s;hall only add, That according to the be&s;t Judgment I am able to make from mary years Ob&s;ervation and Conver&s;ation with him, he has &s;eem'd to enjoy a fixed <HI>Peace</HI> and full <HI>A&s;&s;u|rance</HI> of Faith, as to his Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t and a better Life; And <HI>this</HI> continu'd with him to his la&s;t breath.</P>
<P>I leave it to <HI>Others</HI> to relate the holy <HI>Breath|ings,</HI> and abundant gracious <HI>Words</HI> that flow'd from Him to every one that came about him, all the time of his Sickne&s;s and in his <HI>la&s;t</HI> Day and Hours; which whenever we &s;ee or hear they will be (it may be) one of the brighte&s;t Accounts we yet ever had of <HI>Grace and Peace,</HI> and living Comforts in dying Moments.</P>

WHEN he &s;tood la&s;t in <HI>this</HI> Place he was in weakne&s;s made &s;trong; feeble in body but fer|vent in Spirit; he &s;par'd not him&s;elf nor us; profu&s;e of his own life for the lives of our Souls.</P>
<P>WE have no rea&s;on to doubt but God has taken him to Him&s;elf, where he long'd to be; taken him to the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> his la&s;t de&s;ire.

<P>IT was a more &s;ingular thing in that <HI>Fir&s;t Age</HI> of the World, that a Man of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Piety &s;hould live but 365 years, while the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> came nearer to a thou&s;and. This made &s;o
