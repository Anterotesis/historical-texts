<P>ONE Incomparable Excellency of the Go&s;|pel-In&s;titution, and an unexceptionable Argument of the Divine Original and Authority of it, is the noble Sy&s;tem of Practical Duties and Moral Ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">es, which it affords us.

It is allow'd, that Per&s;ons of Quality, the Great and Rich, &s;uch as <HI>dwell in King's Hou|&s;es</HI> be dignify'd and di&s;tingui&s;h'd by wearing of <HI>Soft Raiment and Co&s;tly Apparel!</HI> But for Inferiours to appear above their Order and Place, and to affect an Equality to Superiours, (the Page to go like his Ma&s;ter,) this threatens Con&s;umption &amp; Confu&s;ion to a Common-Wealth, and is an Enormity not to be tolerated by any wi&s;e and ju&s;t Government.&mdash;This is another Pro|perty, wherein the Virtue under con&s;ideration may be compared to a Garment. Brotherly Kindne&s;s is what God wou'd have Believers to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from others by. This is in Scripture made one di&s;tinctive Character and Badge of the Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion. Thus, Joh. 13. 35. <HI>By this</HI> (&s;aith our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour) <HI>&s;hall men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye have love one to another.</HI> So, 1 Joh. 3. 10. <HI>In this the children of God are manife&s;t, and the children of the Devil: who&s;oever doth not love his Brother, is not of God.</HI> Brotherly Love is the very Mark, and Livery of our Lord's Family.

So likewi&s;e the <HI>Bride</HI> hath her <HI>comely Attire</HI> for Ornament and Splendour.&mdash;Thus in like manner, <HI>Brotherly Kindne&s;s</HI> is none of the lea&s;t <HI>Ornaments of</HI> a Chri&s;tian. This is one of the <HI>Garments of Salvation,</HI> the <HI>White Raiment</HI> of the Saints, and is to them as the Princely Robes, the Prie&s;tly Ve&s;tments, and the Wedding-Garments.

<P>NOW this goodly Raiment, is what the Apo&s;tle exhorts us to <HI>Put on.</HI>&mdash;<HI>Put on Kindne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;The Phra&s;e t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lls us, that this Virtue is <HI>Preternatural:</HI> not a <HI>native</HI> Adjunct, but an <HI>additional</HI> foreign Quality. By the Fall we were &s;tript of this Spiritual Garment, and we come naked into the World. A Man may with as much propriety and truth be &s;aid to be born <HI>dre&s;st,</HI> with his Cloaths on his Back, as endued with a true Principle of <HI>Charity</HI> in his Heart. 'Tis a Complaint of an ancient Date, and ever true of all in the &s;tate of unrenew'd nature,&mdash;<HI>Homo Homini Lupus.</HI>&mdash;Men are naturally mere Wolves, <HI>living in malice and envy, hate|ful and hating one another.</HI> There may be&punc; indeed the &s;hadow and appearance of Love in a Wicked Man, but not the Truth and Reality.</P>
<P>AND when we are <HI>Exhorted</HI> to <HI>Put on</HI> Kindne&s;s; It may note,&mdash;That we &s;hou'd get <HI>furni&s;hed</HI> with the Mantle of Chri&s;tian Charity, provide our &s;elves with it, Have it in a readine&s;s and not have it to &s;eek in time of need.&mdash;And that this &s;hou'd be <HI>proportionable</HI> to us; an&s;werable to our Statu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e and Figure.&mdash;And that we &s;hou'd be every one <HI>Per&s;onally</HI> cloathed with it, that we <HI>our &s;elves</HI> learn to &s;hew Kind|ne&s;s, and not excu&s;e our &s;elves with the pretence of <HI>others</HI> Charity, any more than we &s;hou'd be content to go naked or ragged, while others appear in rich Appa|rel.&mdash;Again, It intimates, that we &s;hould <HI>be&s;tir our &s;elves</HI> and give diligence to work our Hearts into a charitable Frame; that we don't lazily and &s;luggi&s;hly

We mu&s;t put on Charity as duly as we put on our wearing Cloaths. There mu&s;t be an habitual fixed di&s;po&s;ition to it, and a per&s;evering exerci&s;e of it. "We mu&s;t always appear in it, as in our Cloathing, and never without it"; and reckon our &s;elves undre&s;t, to our &s;hame, if it be off at any time.&mdash;We mu&s;t put it on as <HI>Ar|mour:</HI> We mu&s;t buckle it on regularly and be covered with it entirely, as Soldiers compleatly Arm'd: and we mu&s;t daily be proving our Armour, that we may grow skilful and expert in the u&s;e of it, and that it mayn't be a burden to us.&mdash;We mu&s;t put it on as an <HI>Orna|ment;</HI> with as much care and exactne&s;s as a <HI>Bride</HI> puts on her nuptial Attire; with as much Delight and Sa|tisfaction as a <HI>Prince</HI> elect, His Crown &amp; Robes of State; and with as much Solemnity as the <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> of old His goodly Mine&s;terial Apparel.&mdash;In a Word, Our Charity mu&s;t be <HI>vi&s;ible,</HI> apparent, and <HI>&s;hine before others,</HI> as Rich and Splendid Raiment upon us doth; and here|by we &s;hould appear great and di&s;tingui&s;h'd from others, as a Man by the peculiar Habit of his Office. We &s;hou'd take a <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> and a &s;ort of holy <HI>Pride,</HI> in wearing of it, as our Glory, Honour and Prai&s;e.&mdash;Thus the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> in our Text calls upon Chri&s;tians to put on, <HI>as the Elect of God, Holy &amp; Beloved,</HI> Kindne&s;s.</P>

<P>I come now&mdash;</P>
<P>III. TO con&s;ider what <HI>Grounds of Obligation</HI> and <HI>Encouragement</HI> there are to Chri&s;tian Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>I Shall &s;ingle out from among many others the few following Arguments, which I &s;hall but glance upon. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. TO be Kind to others, is required of us by many <HI>Divine Precepts.</HI> Be&s;ides our Text, there are multi|tudes of other Scriptures that bind this upon All. Thus, Eph. 4. 32. <HI>Be ye kind one to another,</HI> So 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 8. <HI>Love as Brethren. Be Pitiful, be courteous.</HI> This indeed is one of the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>capital</HI> Laws of the Go&s;pel, and of the &s;ame Obligation and Importance with the Law of Faith. Hence Faith in Chri&s;t, and Love to our Neighbour, are enjoyned together, as one and the &s;ame Commandment, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 23.&mdash;And now, do we profe&s;s Homage to the ble&s;&s;ed God, as our Lawgiver and King, and &s;hall we trample on the <HI>Royal Law of Love,</HI> and tran&s;gre&s;s one of the Sub&s;tantial and Cardinal
<PB N="26" REF="002118_0027_0FBB93A0FAAFF0E8">
Duties of Religion, peremptorily enjoyned, very fre|quently and mo&s;t earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed and inculcated upon us? If we think we can approve our &s;elves <HI>obedient Chil|dren,</HI> in the neglect of this <HI>weighty matter of the Law,</HI> we gro&s;ly delude our &s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS is to imitate the <HI>Be&s;t Patterns.</HI> Be&s;ides the many Examples of the <HI>Saints,</HI> who <HI>have obtained a good Report,</HI> we have the mo&s;t engaging Example of the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed God,</HI> and of <HI>our gracious Saviour.</HI> Our Heavenly Fa|ther is <HI>of great Kindne&s;s, full of Compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>abun|dant in Goodne&s;s;</HI> He is <HI>kind, even to the unthankful and the Evil.</HI> Well then may we make that Inference, of our Saviour, (Luk. 6. 36.) <HI>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father al&s;o is merciful:</HI> And that of the Apo&s;tle (1 Joh. 4. II.) <HI>Beloved, if God &s;o loved us, we ought to love one another.</HI> Conformity to God is Man's chief Ex|cellency and Beauty. God's Goodne&s;s, or Kindne&s;s is what He reputes His chief Glory and deare&s;t Perfection. And &s;hall we not a&s;pire after this bright and &s;hining Character of the Divine Image? <HI>Be ye imitators of God as dear Children, &amp; walk in Love,</HI> Eph. 5. 1, 2. Moreover our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> hath left us an Example, that we &s;hould follow His Steps. <HI>ye know the Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Kindne&s;s &amp; Love of God our Saviour,</HI> How He <HI>Plea&s;ed not Him&s;elf, went about doing Good, follow'd after the Things which make for Peace,</HI> and a|bounded in all the various Offices of Love to the Souls and Bodies of Men. And <HI>His</HI> Example is monitory of <HI>our</HI> Duty, and bids us <HI>Go &amp; Do likewi&s;e.</HI> Phil. 24, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>Look not every man on his own Things, but every man al&s;o on the Things of others. Let this mind be in you which was al&s;o in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> We &s;hould write after the excellent Copy, He has &s;et us; and by a diligent i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itation endeavour to <HI>&s;hew forth the Vertues of Him, who hath cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed us,</HI> el&s;e in vain do we call Him <HI>Lord &amp; Ma&s;ter.</HI> If the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Chri&s;t (the great &amp; common Benefactor) be not in us, in vain do we call our &s;elves by His Name.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS is to act <HI>agreeably to the End of our Creation,</HI> and <HI>the true Principles of Humanity.</HI> This is becoming

the De&s;ign of our Being, and the Dignity of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Nature, entirely con&s;onant to the genuine Dictates of natural Rea&s;on, and the regular inclination of the &s;anctify'd Will. And it indicates a certain <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> and noble <HI>Genero&s;ity</HI> of Soul, it carries in it an unalterable Excellency and &s;in|gular Amiablene&s;s. 'Tis the high commendation of this Virtue, that it's <HI>approved of men,</HI> [as well as <HI>acceptable to God</HI>] and is one of tho&s;e things <HI>again&s;t which the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e is no law,</HI> Gal.5. 22, 3.

To <HI>follow Charity and Kindne&s;s</HI> is but to <HI>follow Nature,</HI> &amp; pur&s;ue one great End of our coming into the World. Hence Benignity may well be term'd Humanity.</P>
<P N="4">4.
