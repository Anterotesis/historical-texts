Our Time of Life is &s;o &s;hort &amp; uncertain, our Hearts &s;o trifling &amp; deceitful, our Snares and Temptations &s;o many &amp; dangerous; that we had need diligently to Improve all proper Means, to help us forward in the way of Salvation.

<P>And the Lord &s;aid unto <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> Make thee a firy Serpent and &s;et it upon a Pole: and it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that every one that is bitten, when be looketh upon it &s;hall live.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE find in the 4th v. of our Context, that I&s;rael <HI>Journey|ed from Mount Hor, by the way of the Red-Sea, to compa&s;s the Land of Edom; and the Soul of the People was much di&s;courag'd becau&s;e of the way.</HI> They were fatigu'd and tir'd
<PB N="2" REF="001936_0008_0FBA3392CF1BF350">
with this tedious Journey, and we find, v. 5. <HI>They &s;pake again&s;t God, and again&s;t Mo&s;es.</HI> Often before this, when they met with dif|ficulties, they murmured again&s;t God, and again&s;t his faithful Servants, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &amp; <HI>Aaron</HI>; and this vile practice they renew and re|peat upon this new difficulty they met with. And for this their Sin, God plagues them. v. 6. <HI>And the Lord &s;ent firy Serpents among the People; and they bit the People, and much Peo|ple of I&s;rael dyed.</HI> It's likely the&s;e <HI>Serpents</HI> were called <HI>firy,</HI> either becau&s;e their <HI>colour</HI> &s;omewhat re&s;embled that of fire; or rather, becau&s;e tho&s;e bitten with them were tor|mented with a <HI>Scortching burning heat</HI> in their Bodies, being greatly <HI>Inflam'd,</HI> &s;cortch'd with thir&s;t which nothing could quench. The&s;e Sinners were &s;erv'd in their kind, were fill'd with their own ways; their Tongues had been Influenc'd by the old Serpent the De|vil, they were &s;et on fire of Hell in &s;peak|ing again&s;t God and <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and now firy Serpents are &s;ent to puni&s;h them. Under this Plague, the People confe&s;s their Sin, de&s;ire <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to Pray to God for them, which he did, v. 7. We don't find, that God pre&s;ently de&s;troy'd or remov'd the&s;e Serpents; but our Text tells us, God order'd a remedy for tho&s;e bitten and wounded with the Serpents. He orders <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to make a brazen Serpent, and &s;et it on a Pole, that the bitten I&s;raelites looking to it might be heal'd and live. Now this <HI>brazen Serpent,</HI> which was thus &s;et up on a Pole to heal the wounded I&s;raelites; was a <HI>Type</HI> of Je&s;us
<PB N="3" REF="001936_0009_0FBA33949B32FF58">
Chri&s;t, who was lifted up and dyed on the Cro&s;s, to &s;ave Sinners. Our Saviour Him|&s;elf &s;o expounds and applies it. Joh. 3.14, 15. <HI>And as Mo&s;es lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderne&s;s, even &s;o mu&s;t the Son of Man be lifted up. That who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h but have everla&s;ting Life.</HI> As every I&s;ra|elite &s;tung with the firy Serpents, liv'd, if he did but look on the brazen Serpent; &s;o, every Sinner that believes in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hall live for ever. The Hebrew word, <HI>NES,</HI> which in our Text is rendred a <HI>Pole</HI>; is tran&s;lated an <HI>Eng&s;ign,</HI> and plainly refers to Chri&s;t. I&s;ai. 11.10. <HI>And in that day, there &s;hall be a root of Je&s;&s;e, which &s;hall &s;tand for an En&s;ign of the People; to it &s;hall the Gentiles &s;eek, and his rest &s;hall be glorious.</HI> The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is that En&s;ign of the Peo|ple, to which many of the Gentiles &s;eek and are Saved.</P>
<P>From the words we may ob&s;erve this</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> As tho&s;e I&s;raelites bitten with the firy Serpents, who look'd to the brazen Serpent, were &s;av'd Alive; &s;o, tho&s;e Sinners who believe in Chri&s;t &s;hall be &s;av'd for ever.</HEAD>
<P>This Doctrine is to be handled, by &s;how|ing in &s;undry particulars &s;ome Parallel or Similitude, between the Malady and Reme|dy of tho&s;e I&s;raelites mention'd in our Text; and the Malady which Per&s;ons have by Sin, and their Remedy thro' Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="001936_0010_0FBA339628A5DA70">1. <HI>Tho&s;e bitten by the firy Serpents, were grie|vou&s;ly wounded.</HI> Doubtle&s;s tho&s;e bitings, oc|ca&s;ion'd extream pain and angui&s;h: many dy'd of their wounds, and we don't find that any recover'd of them (and tis likely none did) but tho&s;e who look'd to the brazen Serpent. So, all Men are grievou&s;ly woun|ded by Sin, they are &s;tung by the old Ser|pent, the Devil. The Devil made u&s;e of a Serpent, to draw our fir&s;t Parents into Sin. Gen. 3.1. <HI>The Serpent beguiled Eve thro' his &s;ubtlety,</HI> 2 Cor. 11.3. This Dragon, this old Serpent was the Devil and Satan, which de|ceiveth the whole World, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12 9. The old Serpent the Devil, drew our Fir&s;t Parents into Sin, and &s;o all their Po&s;terity with them. <HI>For by one man &s;in entred into the World, and death by &s;in; and &s;o death hath pa&s;&s;ed upon all men for that all have &s;inned &mdash; by one man's di&s;obedience many were made &s;inners,</HI> Rom. 5.12, 19 All have Sinned and come &s;hort of the Glory of God. All meer Men &s;ince the fall of Adam, are &s;hapen in Iniquity and con|ceiv'd in Sin; and &s;o they are Children of wrath by nature. Indeed they are all Sin|ners, and Sin is a grievous terrible wound. <HI>Sin is a Mortal wound,</HI> the <HI>wages of it is Death,</HI> Rom 6.23 Every Sin in its own na|ture tends to eternal Death and Mi&s;ery; it de&s;erves &s;uch Death. <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one that continues not in all things written in the book of the Law to do them,</HI> Gal. 3.10 Yea, Sin is a <HI>wound</HI> very grievous, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, tormenting to the awakened Con&s;ciences of tho&s;e, who are not at pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ible of their Intere&s;t in
<PB N="5" REF="001936_0011_0FBA33975C297518">
the healing blood of Chri&s;t. Di&s;tre&s;s of Soul for Sin, is &s;ometimes compar'd to <HI>broken bones,</HI> P&s;al. 51.8. To a being <HI>weary and heavy laden,</HI> Mat. 11.28. To an In&s;upportable Burthen, P&s;al. 38.4. <HI>Mine iniquities are gone over mine head, as an heavy Burthen, they are too heavy for me.</HI> Sen&s;e of Sin, made <HI>David's bones wax old, he roared all the day long &mdash; his moi&s;ture was turned into the drought of Summer,</HI> P&s;al. 32 3, 4. Our Tongues can't expre&s;s the Grief and Horror, the Angui&s;h, Pain, amazing Trouble and Di&s;quietment, which Per&s;ons often feel in their own Souls by rea&s;on of their Sins. All the Wounds which a Man's Body can receive, are not &s;o hurtful to him, as the Wounds which Sin gives to his Soul. Sin is &s;uch a mortal Stab, &s;uch a poy&s;onous Wound, as will certainly Kill and Damn a Per&s;on for ever, unle&s;s the healing Blood of Chri&s;t be applyed to it. Surely, Sin is a mo&s;t grievous Wound. If any ask, Why don't Men com|plain more of this wound? If all are thus wounded, why don't they expre&s;s their trou|ble, danger, concern more frequently than they do? I an&s;wer, they are not duely &s;en&s;i|ble of their wounds. Many that are Mortal|ly wounded by Sin, are yet &s;tupid; they are in a &s;ort of Spiritual Lethargy. Per&s;ons are never reckon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d more dangerous in bodily di&s;tempers, than when they're mo&s;t &s;tupid, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and make no complaint at all: tho&s;e are mo&s;t <HI>dangerous</HI> that are in &s;uch a condition. So, tho&s;e that are lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible of their danger by Sin, lea&s;t concern'd about it; are indeed in mo&s;t danger by it. Their Souls &s;eem &s;tupid and
<PB N="6" REF="001936_0012_0FBA339907CFADF8">
benum'd, they &s;eem ha&s;tening to hell, without thinking or con&s;idering where they are going. They are not &s;en&s;ible of their wounds, that's the rea&s;on they don't complain. They're &s;o much taken up about their bodies, that they utterly neglect their Souls. Sin is a wound, and a dreadful dangerous one too; this is the fir&s;t thing.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The&s;e bitten I&s;raelites could not be heal'd or cur'd, by any art or skill of their own.</HI> Writers &s;ay, that when per&s;ons were bitten by the&s;e poy&s;onous Serpents, Phy&s;icians were wont to give them over as uncurable, irrecoverable: No art or skill of men could &s;ave them. If they appli'd never &s;o many Medicines of their own contriving, yet they could not be cured thereby. So, Men can't by any skill, art or power of their own, &s;ave them&s;elves from that eternal death which their Sins have ju&s;tly de&s;erved. Fallen men, Sinners, are <HI>without &s;trength,</HI> Rom. 5.6. Their de&s;truction is of them&s;elves, they are the guilty Authors of it; but they have no &s;trength to deliver them&s;elves from the power, guilt or puni&s;h|ment of Sin.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Not from the power of Sin.</HI> Men are na|turally, <HI>Dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and in &s;ins,</HI> Eph. 2.1. And they can't create new Life in their own Souls: no man can come to the Son, except the Father draws him. True believers are born, <HI>not of blood, nor of the will of the fre&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God,</HI> Joh. 1.13. 'Tis God of his own will that does beget them; that creates them in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, according to the exceeding greatne&s;s of his power, the
<PB N="7" REF="001936_0013_0FBA339B6FF57740">
working of his Mighty Power, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.19, <HI>Faith</HI> is <HI>Gods Gift,</HI> Eph. 208. So is <HI>Repentance</HI> too, <HI>Acts</HI> 5.31. Alas, without Chri&s;t Sinners can do nothing: 'tis God that works in them to will and to do of his own good plea&s;ure. So that Men can't &s;ave or deliver them&s;elves from the filth, the power, the prevailing efficacy of Sin.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Nor from the guilt or puni&s;hment of Sin.</HI> They cannot by all their doings or &s;ufferings, &s;atisfie Gods ju&s;tice, and purcha&s;e their own deliverance. When they have done their be&s;t, they are unprofitable Servants. If they &s;hould offer thou&s;ands of Rams, or ten thou&s;ands of Rivers of oyl; give their fir&s;t-born for their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and the fruit of their bodies for the &s;in of their Souls, yet it would not be a &s;ufficient Sacrifice. They are not redeemed with <HI>corruptable things,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>&s;ilver and gold,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.18. <HI>They can by no means redeem their Brother</HI> (nor them&s;elves neither) <HI>nor give to God a ran&s;ome for him,</HI> P&s;al. 49.7. The re|demption of the Soul, is too precious to be wrought by them. They can't buy off eter|nal plagues and puni&s;hments. There is Sal|vation in none but Chri&s;t; <HI>Neither is there any other name given under heaven among men, where|by they can be &s;aved,</HI> Act. 4.12. As the&s;e bit|ten I&s;raelites, could not heal nor cure them|&s;elves; &s;o neither can Sinners deliver them|&s;elves from the power, guilt or puni&s;hment of Sin, by any art, skill or power of their own. If they have no help but of their own procuring, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily peri&s;h for ever.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="8" REF="001936_0014_0FBA339C8685EFE8">3. <HI>It was God that appointed this brazen Ser|pent, for the healing of the people.</HI> 'Twas not any device or contrivance of their own, 'twas not man's Wi&s;dom that propos'd this method. So, 'twas God that appointed Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be the Saviour of Sinners. The Way of &s;a|ving Sinners thro' Chri&s;t, was not the re&s;ult of the Wi&s;dom or Contrivance neither of Men nor Angels; 'twas originally and wholly from God. God did elect and chu&s;e Chri&s;t, to the Office and Work of a Redeemer. Hence Chri&s;t is called, God's <HI>Servant,</HI> and His <HI>Elect,</HI> I&s;ai. 42.1. 'Tis &s;aid of Chri&s;t, He was faith|ful to Him that <HI>appointed</HI> Him, <HI>Heb.</HI> 3.2. God cho&s;e, call'd, appointed Him to His Mediato|rial Work and Service. Tho' Mans Mi&s;ery is of his own procuring, yet his Salvation is of God's contriving and procuring.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>'Twas of God's meer unde&s;erved Mercy and Grace, that He provided a Remedy for the bitten I&s;raelites.</HI> They had provoked God, &s;poken again&s;t Him, and again&s;t His faithful Servant <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>; God was ju&s;tly angry with them. He had &s;ent Serpents to bite and wound them, many dyed of their Wounds; and if all had dyed that were bitten, 'twas no more than what they had ju&s;tly de&s;erved. Now for &s;uch unworthy, provoking Sinners as the&s;e, God provided a Remedy; &s;urely 'twas nothing but meer, &s;overeign, unde&s;erved Mercy and Grace that could move him thus to do. So, 'twas meer, &s;overeign, unde&s;erved Mercy and Grace and nothing el&s;e, that mov'd God to provide a Saviour for poor, mi&s;erable, &s;elf-undoing Sinners. God did not give his Son to &s;ave
<PB N="9" REF="001936_0015_0FBA33A073B28710">
Sinners on the account of any Merit, Worthi|ne&s;s, or good De&s;erving in them, for they were unworthy of any Favour. They ju&s;tly de&s;erv'd Eternal Wrath and Vengeance: God might have glorify'd His Ju&s;tice in their ever|la&s;ting Ruin and De&s;truction. God's Happi|ne&s;s does not depend on the Sinners Salvation. God &s;tood in no need of their Happine&s;s; He had no nece&s;&s;ity of their Recovery. If He had pleas'd to have &s;inle&s;s Men to &s;erve and prai&s;e Him; He might have created a new, holy Stock, and have given them Grace to be eternally Obedient to Him, if He had &s;een meet &s;o to do. Or if He had de&s;ir'd to glori|fy His Grace in the Redemption of Sinners, He might have done it (if he had &s;een meet) in the Salvation of fallen Angels, who were originally of a Rank and Order &s;uperior to Man. Indeed &s;inful Men did no way de&s;erve God's Favour, nor had He any need of their Salvation; 'twas therefore of His mo&s;t free and &s;overeign Grace, that He gave His Son to be their Redeemer. So we read, Joh. 3.16. <HI>God &s;o loved the world, as to give his only begot|ten Son; that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but &s;hould have everla&s;ting Life.</HI> Rom. 5.8. <HI>God commendeth his love to us, in that while we were yet &s;inners, Christ dyed for us.</HI> Thus we &s;ee, that Gods &s;ending His Son to &s;ave Sinners, is a&s;cribed to His <HI>Love</HI>: 'Tis menti|oned (and that very ju&s;tly) as an admirable Effect of His amazing, unparallel Love.

There was no natural Efficacy in that piece of Bra&s;s, to heal wounded Specta|tors, as there is in the Sun to warm the Earth it &s;hines on. Nay, Writers &s;ay, that when Per&s;ons were bitten with tho&s;e poy&s;onous Serpents, 'twas very hurtful for them to look upon bright &s;hining Bra&s;s. Carnal Rea|&s;on in a bitten I&s;raelite might &s;ay, What &s;hould I look upon that piece of Bra&s;s in the Figure of a Serpent for, what good can it do me? And yet 'twas the Duty of &s;uch bitten Per&s;ons to look on it for healing. The healing did proceed from Gods Appointment and In&s;titution; and from His own efficaci|ous Power exerted in that His own Way. So, the Way of Salvation through Chri&s;t, is very unlikely, if nothing but Mans carnal Rea&s;on makes the Judgment of it. Carnal Men were apt to think concerning Chri&s;t,

Thus carnal Rea&s;on often rejects and di&s;approves the Means appointed by God, even by infi|nite Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s. Yet tis the Du|ty of all that live under the Go&s;pel, to believe in Chri&s;t for Salvation. 1 Joh. 3.23. <HI>This is his commandment, that we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> believe in the name of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> This is the Way of Gods chu&s;ing and appointing, therefore all &s;hould walk in it, though never &s;o contrary to carnal Rea&s;on.

When a bitten I&s;raelite looked on the brazen Serpent, twas not any Vertue or Merit in his <HI>Act of looking,</HI> that obtained the Cure; but the whole Benefit did proceed from Gods In&s;titution and Ble&s;&s;ing. So, when we tru&s;t in Chri&s;t for Salvation, tis not our <HI>Act of tru&s;ting</HI> that really merits or de&s;erves the Benefit; but this tru&s;ting is appointed by God, as the Way in which we are to ex|pect His Favour. We &s;hould expect Gods Ble&s;&s;ing in His own Way, and not give heed to any contrary Arguings. This might teach us, diligently to attend on all Ordinances of Gods appointment. Let us not &s;ay, What good &s;hall I get by the&s;e and tho&s;e Ordinan|ces; what &s;piritual good can I get by <HI>Bap|ti&s;m</HI> and the <HI>Lords Supper?</HI> How can the&s;e convey any Benefit to my Soul?

is carnal Arguing and Rea&s;oning; for the&s;e are Means of Gods appointing, therefore we ought heartily and obediently to attend on them, depending on God alone for the Ble&s;&s;ings repre&s;ented and exhibited thereby. If the bitten I&s;raelites had in&s;i&s;ted on this, We wont look on the brazen Serpent, it can do us no good; then they might all have dy|ed of their Wounds.

think unworthy of it; I &s;ay, if they Mur|mur at the&s;e things, 'tis plainly a faulting and condemning of what God does. We therefore now proceed to con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Greatne&s;s of this Sin.</HI> Murmuring is a very vile Impiety, a very great Sin. Di&s;|obedience (as &s;uch) to the Divine Law, is a practical contempt of Gods Authority; a &s;aying, <HI>Who is the Lord that I &s;hould obey him</HI>? Murmuring is an implicit faulting of Gods Government; a condemning the Steps and Methods he takes in ordering of his Creatures. Indeed there <HI>may be</HI> &s;uch a thing, as faulting (and that ju&s;tly) the In&s;truments of our Trouble, where yet there is no Murmuring again&s;t God; but a Patient bearing of his Hand in the Tryal. But on the other hand, when Per&s;ons are Fretful, Impatient, Di&s;|content under Afflictions, whether they have much regard to In&s;truments or not; this is Murmuring, and a great Crime it is: For it highly and ba&s;ely reflects on God, who orders and governs all things in his Provi|dence as he plea&s;eth: 'Tis an implicit judg|ing, faulting, condemning what God does. This highly Reflects,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Upon Gods Sovereignty.</HI> As for Gods own Being, it is Nece&s;&s;ary and Eternal. As for the Being of Creatures, it depends in|tirely on Gods Sovereign Plea&s;ure. <HI>For his plea&s;ure, all things are and were created,</HI> Rev. 4.11. God has made <HI>the Heaven, Earth, Sea, and all things therein; and he pre&s;erveth them all,</HI> Neh. 9.6. 'Tis of Gods meer Sovereign Plea&s;ure, that he has made Creatures, and
<PB N="26" REF="001936_0032_0FBA33C8D00E5A00">
that he continues them in Being. There|fore he mu&s;t needs have the mo&s;t ab&s;olute Lord&s;hip and Dominion over them, that po&s;&s;ibly can be. He is the Supream Lord and owner of them, and may therefore order and di&s;po&s;e of them as he &s;ees meet. <HI>The Earth is the Lords and the fulne&s;s thereof; the World and they that dwell therein,</HI> P&s;al. 24.1. Therefore <HI>he may do according to his will in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth; none may &s;tay his hand, or &s;ay to him, what doest thou</HI>? Dan. 4.35. Per&s;ons commonly reckon, that Men may di&s;po&s;e of their own things as they will; as the Lord of the Vineyard &s;aid, Mat. 20.15. <HI>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, becau&s;e I am good</HI>? Surely then, the Great GOD may do what he will with his own: He's the &s;overeign Potter, we are the Clay; he may make one Ve&s;&s;el to Honour and another to Di&s;honour as he will. Now, when Per&s;ons Murmur and Repine at that Condition, at tho&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances which Providence orders to them; therein they do as it were arraign and con|demn Gods Sovereignty; they implicitely &s;ay, God has no right thus to order things as he does, at his own Plea&s;ure. Surely, 'tis great and daring Wickedne&s;s, thus to im|peach and condemn Gods Sovereignty, his &s;overeign Government of the World. When <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aid to our Lord, <HI>What &s;hall this Man do</HI>? Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, <HI>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee</HI>? Joh. 21.21, 22. So, O Man, though thou art in great Ad|ver&s;ity,
<PB N="27" REF="001936_0033_0FBA33CA4A567FE8">
while God be&s;tows great Pro&s;perity on others; yet, what is that to thee? May he not di&s;po&s;e his own Favours as he will? What is that to thee, if others have Health while thou ha&s;t Sickne&s;s; if others are loaded with Honour, while thou art loaded with Contempt; if others are Rich while thou art Poor; if others have their Hou&s;es and E&s;tates continu'd, while thine are taken away; if others have their Wives, Children, or other dear Relatives continu'd, while thine are taken away? Sure|ly, God may do what he will with his own When thou do&s;t fret and vex at thy Condi|tion, thou do&s;t Murmur again&s;t God; thou do&s;t practically condemn his Sovereignty, and &s;how thy &s;elf di&s;pleas'd that he has the actual Government of the World in his own Hand. Thy Murmuring is as it were a practical E&s;&s;ay to rob God of his Crown, thru&s;t him from his Throne, and wre&s;t his Scepter out of his Hand. Such proud, daring Arrogance as this, mu&s;t needs be a great and heinous Offence. Murmuring does Reflect,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>On Gods Infinite Wi&s;dom.</HI> God is the Father of Lights, his Under&s;tanding is infi|nite, he is Wi&s;dom it &s;elf. He acts with infinite Wi&s;dom, in all his Works of Creati|on and Providence too: P&s;al. 104.14. <HI>O Lord, how manifold are thy works, in Wi&s;dom ha&s;t thou made them all.</HI> The Lord of Ho&s;ts <HI>is wonder|ful in Coun&s;el, and excellent in Working,</HI> I&s;al. 28.29. <HI>He worketh all things according to the
<PB N="28" REF="001936_0034_0FBA33CED35F3698">
Coun&s;el of his own will,</HI> Eph. 1.11. God in all he does, always aims at the highe&s;t and be&s;t End, even his own Glory; he has made all things for him&s;elf, and he orders all things after the be&s;t manner that can be, to ob|tain this be&s;t End; and therefore he orders all things in infinite Wi&s;dom. But when Men Murmur, Repine, Fret, and are Di&s;|content at the Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence; therein they reflect on Gods Wi&s;dom. They practically &s;ay, God does not know how to govern the World well and wi&s;ely, he does not take right and proper Steps in his Rule and Conduct; for if he orders things well and wi&s;ely, then why do they yet complain? Now it mu&s;t needs be a very great Crime, thus to reflect on the un&s;earchible Wi&s;dom of the great God. Shall &s;uch Bats, &s;uch ignorant, &s;hort-&s;ighted blind Creatures as we are, arraign and condemn the wi&s;e Con|duct of Divine Providence? Yet thus wick|edly we do, when we Murmur at Afflicti|ons. Job 40.3. <HI>Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty, in&s;truct him! He that reproveth God, let him an&s;wer it.</HI> 'Tis wicked Arro|gance, for any to pretend to in&s;truct the Al|mighty, or reprove him for any part of his Conduct. He that Murmurs, practically &s;ays, that God does not govern wi&s;ely; and this Reflection mu&s;t needs be a great offence. Murmuring Reflects,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>On Gods Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> In|deed&punc; <HI>God is a God of Truth and without ini|quity, just and right is he,</HI> Deut. 32 4. Shall not God the Judge of all the Earth, do right?
<PB N="29" REF="001936_0035_0FBA33D3A65CC148">
Yes &s;urely, he cannot do a wrong, or an unrighteous thing. <HI>He is Righteous in all his ways, and Holy in all his works,</HI> P&s;al. 145.17. Men often do unju&s;t things; yea, Good Men, through Ignorance, or pre&s;ent Preva|lency of Corruption, &s;ometimes do unju&s;t things, and &s;o may ju&s;tly de&s;erve Blame. But God is unchangibly Wi&s;e, Ju&s;t, Holy, Righteous; and &s;o cannot do an unju&s;t thing. As 'tis <HI>impo&s;&s;ible for God to lye,</HI> &s;o 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for God to be unju&s;t, or to act unju&s;tly; for <HI>there is no variablene&s;s with him, nor any &s;hadow of turning,</HI> Jam. 1.17. Yet when Men Murmur at their Condition, they practically charge God with treating them hardly, with dealing unju&s;tly with them. If they meet with no unju&s;t Treatment, then they have no rea&s;on to find fault; there|fore their finding fault plainly implies, that they think them&s;elves unfairly dealt with, and that they don't de&s;erve the tryals they meet with, or that others ought not to be &s;o high, and they &s;o low in the World: Ezek. 18.25. <HI>Yet ye &s;ay, the way of the Lord is not equal.</HI> They wickedly charg'd God with Innequa|lity and Inju&s;tice in the Methods of his Providence. This was the Spirit and Tem|per of tho&s;e, Mal. 3.13, 14. <HI>Your words have been &s;tout again&s;t me, &s;aith the Lord, yet ye &s;ay, what have we &s;poken &s;o much again&s;t thee? Ye have &s;aid, it is vain to &s;erve God; and what profit is it, that we have kept his Ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord</HI>? They &s;eem evidently to complain, that God did not deal with them &s;o well
<PB N="30" REF="001936_0036_0FBA33D82F7EDFE0">
as he &s;hould; that he did not be&s;tow on them the Benefits and Ble&s;&s;ings which they de&s;erved. The &s;ame ill Spirit appear'd in tho&s;e, I&s;ai. 58.3. Wherefore have we fasted, &s;ay they, and thou &s;ee&s;t not? Wherefore have we afflicted our &s;oul, and thou take&s;t no knowledge?

This is the Heaven-provoking Language, of a Murmuring, Di&s;contented Spirit. Murmuring is a great Crime, 'tis a charging of God with Inju&s;tice. Murmur|ing highly Reflects,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>On the Goodne&s;s of God.</HI> Murmuring implies a contempt of, and unthankfulne&s;s for the Goodne&s;s of God. <HI>God is good, and his tender Mercies are over all his works,</HI> P&s;al. 145.9. There's no Per&s;on in the World, but what receives more or le&s;s of the To|kens of Gods Goodne&s;s. All Men are Sin|ners, and the Wages of Sin is Death. There|fere all that per&s;ons have on this &s;ide Death, on this &s;ide the unquenchible Flames of Hell, is owing to meer Divine Mercy and Kindne&s;s; 'tis better than they de&s;erve: For they are <HI>le&s;s than the lea&s;t of Gods Mercies,</HI> as <HI>Jacob</HI> confe&s;s'd of him&s;elf, <HI>Gen.</HI> 32.10. Un|der their heavie&s;t Lo&s;&s;es, Tryals, Di&s;ap|pointments, Afflictions, they &s;hould yet &s;ay, <HI>God puni&s;hes us le&s;s than our Inquities de&s;erve; 'tis of the Lords Mercy we are not con&s;umed: Wherefore &s;hould a living Man complain, a Man
<PB N="31" REF="001936_0037_0FBA33D94F85BD58">
for the puni&s;hment</HI> of <HI>his Sins?</HI> Under our &s;ore&s;t Afflictions, we yet have many Mer|cies, though we de&s;erve none; therefore we have always cau&s;e to be Thankful, but ne|ver any cau&s;e to Complain. But when we Murmur and Repine, it &s;hows a contempt of Gods Goodne&s;s to us; as though it did not de&s;erve our Notice of it, or Thank|fulne&s;s for it. This de&s;pi&s;ing of Gods Good|ne&s;s, mu&s;t needs be highly provoking to him. Oh Man, do&s;t thou Murmur at thy Af|flictions? Thou do&s;t Reproach God in do|ing it. God deals far better with thee than thou de&s;erve&s;t, thou ha&s;t no rea&s;on to Re|pine, but much rea&s;on to be Thankful. Ha&s;t thou lo&s;t part of thy E&s;tate? 'Tis a Mercy thou ha&s;t not lo&s;t it all. If thou ha&s;t lo&s;t all thy E&s;tate, yet 'tis a Mercy thou ha&s;t thy Liberty, and art not a mi&s;erable Captive among cruel Enemies. It may be thou ha&s;t Health and Ea&s;e in thy Body; that's a great Mercy. Or if thou ha&s;t Sick|ne&s;s and Pain, yet 'tis a great Mercy that thy Sight and thy Hearing are continued to thee. 'Tis a Mercy that the u&s;e of thy Rea&s;on is continued to thee. In a Word, Sure I am, 'tis a great Mercy that thou art out of Hell, that thou art under the Go&s;|pel, that thou ha&s;t the Bible for thy Guide and Comfort; and &s;o ha&s;t an Opportunity to lay up Trea&s;ures in Heaven, to &s;ecure an unfading Inheritance, an eternal weight of Glory. 'Tis wicked Ingratitude, a vile contempt of Gods Goodne&s;s, for one &s;o circum&s;tanced as thou art; to Murmur and
<PB N="32" REF="001936_0038_0FBA33DAD20BCBF8">
Repine at Troubles and Afflictions. Thus we &s;ee, that Murmuring is a very great Sin; it highly reflects on the Sovereignty, Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Goodne&s;s of the Great GOD; and this mu&s;t needs be a great Offence, an high Affront indeed to the Great GOD.</P>

Di&s;content burnt in their hearts, brake forth in their Words or Actions or more probably in both; and kindled the fire of Gods wrath which con|&s;um'd them.

<P>PROP. I. <HI>The Fear of God &s;hould keep us from Sinning.</HI> Sin is a breach of Gods Law. 1 Joh. 3.4. <HI>Who&s;oever committeth &s;in, tran&s;gre&s;|&s;eth al&s;o the Law; for &s;in is a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law.</HI> Sin is a very great evil, Ina&s;|much as 'tis an affront to the Infinitely Great GOD. And as 'tis a great Evil, &s;o it de&s;erves great Mi&s;ery. <HI>The wages of &s;in is death,</HI> Rom. 6.23. Tho&s;e who are the Servants of Sin, are like to be the Subjects of Death, even of Eternal Death and Mi&s;ery. This Eternal Mi&s;ery, will be Inflicted by Divine Ju&s;tice, on tho&s;e who go on ob&s;tinately in ways of wickedne&s;s. Therefore the true Fear of God, and of His holy di&s;plea&s;ure, is the be&s;t Re|medy or Pre&s;ervative again&s;t Sin. Every Re|generate Per&s;on, every true Convert, has in him the root and principle of every true &s;aving Grace. As he has true Faith &amp; Tru&s;t in Gods Mercy thro' Chri&s;t; &s;o he has true Love to God, and true filial Fear of Him. True Fear God, is a &s;aving Grace.

The more Men fear God, the more careful they'l be to avoid Sin, and to practi&s;e holine&s;s. Job 28.28. <HI>The fear of the Lord, that is wi&s;dom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</HI> A Per&s;on's truly fearing of God, Implies in it, his <HI>real belief</HI> that God is &s;uch an One as He has declar'd Him&s;elf to be, and his being <HI>&s;uitably Affected</HI> there|with; and &s;o it tends directly to keep him from Sinning. A realizing belief of his <HI>Know|ledge, Holine&s;s, Power</HI> and <HI>Faithfulne&s;s,</HI> does &s;o.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A realizing belief of His Knowledge.</HI> Gods Law &s;hould be our rule in all things; we &s;hould conform our Thoughts, Words, and Deeds unto it continually. And God mo&s;t critically ob&s;erves whether we do &s;o or not. Tho' many of our Actions may be hid from Men, yet none of them can be hid from God. He &s;ays, Jer. 23.23, 24. <HI>Can any hide him&s;elf in &s;ecret places, that I &s;hall not &s;ee him, &s;aith the Lord? Do not I fill Heaven and Earth, &s;aith the Lord?</HI> God is pre&s;ent every where, &s;ees all things, &s;trictly ob&s;erves whether we regard his Authority and obey His Precepts, yea or no. God's Eyes are on all our ways: there's not a word in our Tongue, but lo, He knows it altogether: Yea He knows the things that come into our Minds, even every one of them. <HI>His eyes are in every place beholding the evil and the good,</HI> Prov. 15.3. <HI>There is no Creature that is not manife&s;t in his &s;ight; all things are open and naked to the eyes
<PB N="45" REF="001936_0051_0FBA33F8D41C02A0">
of him with whom we have to do.</HI> Heb. 4.13. Tho' many Sins are &s;ecret as to Men, yet none are &s;o as to God; His Knowledge is Infinite. A realizing belief of this exten&s;ive univer&s;al Knowledge of God; would tend very much to keep us from Sinning. Per|&s;ons are often re&s;train'd from Sin, by the Pre&s;ence of &s;erious, grave, godly Men, their Fellow. Creatures; and how much more would it re&s;train them from Sin, if they &s;eriou&s;ly believ'd and con&s;ider'd, that the All-&s;eeing Eye of their infinitely Holy and Glorious Judge, is continually upon them?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A realizing Belief of his Holine&s;s.</HI> As God <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> &s;ees and knows all the Sins any are guilty of, &s;o, he as <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> hates and ab|hors them. Sin is the mo&s;t hateful thing to God that can be, yea, the only thing that <HI>provokes</HI> him; 'tis the abominable thing that his Soul hates. <HI>He has no plea&s;ure in wicked|ne&s;s, evil &s;hall not dwell with him; he hates all workers of iniquity,</HI> P&s;al. 5.4, 5. <HI>He is of purer eyes than to behold evil, he cannot look on iniquity,</HI> Hab. 1.13. No vile Object in the World, is &s;o loath&s;ome and abominable to Men as all Sin is to God. 'Tis nothing but Sin, that hin|ders the Communication of Ble&s;&s;ings and Favours from God to Men. <HI>Your iniqui|ties have &s;eparated between you and your God.</HI> I&s;ai. 59.2. <HI>Your &s;ins have witholden good things from you,</HI> Jer. 5.25. God has manife&s;ted his matchle&s;s, glorious Holine&s;s and Purity, and &s;o his Hatred of Sin, in ca&s;ting the fallen Angels into Chains of Darkne&s;s, in threat|ening

Death as the Wages of Sin; in drown|ing the old World with a Flood for their Wickedne&s;s; in bringing numberle&s;s terrible Judgments on particular Per&s;ons, Families, Nations, Kingdoms, Countrys for their Sins; and in bringing terrible Sufferings on our ble&s;&s;ed Lord Je&s;us, who became <HI>Surety</HI> for his cho&s;en People, and undertook to <HI>&s;atisfy for their Sins.</HI> Though God through Chri&s;t can be Reconciled to <HI>Returning Sinners,</HI> yet he can|not be Reconciled to Sin it &s;elf. Now a Re|alizing Belief of God's infinite Holine&s;s, his unnutterable Hatred and Loathing of Sin, tends to keep Men from Sinning. While the true <HI>Fear of God</HI> actually and vigorou&s;ly ope|rates in the Soul, a Per&s;on would not dare knowingly to Sin again&s;t him, to do any thing which he knows to be &s;o <HI>unutterably Hateful</HI> to him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A Realizing Belief of his Power.</HI> Gods <HI>Power</HI> is as great to puni&s;h Sin, as his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> to hate it.

But Gods Eye beholds <HI>all Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors,,</HI> he needs no Witne&s;&s;es to in|form him; his Hand al&s;o is <HI>long</HI> enough to reach them all, and <HI>&s;trong</HI> enough to inflict the mo&s;t terrible Judgments on them. He is the Lord Almighty; the Lord God Omni|potent Reigneth; nothing is too hard for him, all things are po&s;&s;ible with him. <HI>Ob&s;tinate Sin|ners</HI> can't po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape his <HI>terrible Revenges.</HI> Who ever hardened him&s;elf again&s;t God and pro&s;pered? <HI>Do we provoke the Lord to jealou&s;y,

Oh let us daily think of Death, let it be often in our Thoughts: our thinking daily and frequently on it, need not take up our Time &s;o as to hinder us from any proper bu&s;ine&s;s. Death will mo&s;t certainly come. It may be we &s;ometimes fear the&s;e and tho&s;e Outward troubles, think they will come, yet 'tis not certain that they'll come, po&s;&s;ibly they may not.

But as it's <HI>certain</HI> Death will come, and that 'tis every Moment ap|proaching <HI>nearer</HI> to us; yet 'tis uncertain how near it may be. Many are apt to put far a|way the evil Day, when they think of Death, they &s;till think of it <HI>as at &s;ome Years di&s;tance</HI>: But alas, Such Thoughts are groundle&s;s.

He was a <HI>Fool,</HI> for flattering him&s;elf with thoughts of <HI>long Life,</HI> when he knew not <HI>how near</HI> Death was to him. It's probable, there are many &s;uch Fools in the World. Oh, What Sciences do they form in their own Minds? They reckon upon long Life, they plot and contrive to buy and &s;ell and get Gain; to get &s;uch and &s;uch de&s;irable Enjoyments, to obtain much worldly Grandeur and Plea|&s;ure; but Death comes and nips them in the Bud, cuts them off before ever they po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd what they thus vainly promis'd to them&s;elves. Therefore let us meditate much on the <HI>certainty of Death,</HI> and the <HI>uncertainty when</HI> 'twill come: This tends to quicken us

Such vile Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, were the&s;e <HI>Young Men</HI> &s;poken of in our Text.

<P N="1">1. <HI>'Twas of Gods Soveraign Goodne&s;s, that He purpos'd to make Men, to be&s;tow Benefits on them, and that He did give being to them.</HI> It is the Lord that hath made us, and not we our &s;elves. <HI>He has of one Blood made all Na|tions of Men to dwell on the face of the Earth,</HI> Act. 17.26.

from any <HI>need</HI> He had of Creatures (for He's Infinitely, Unchangeably Self-&s;ufficient and All-&s;ufficient) but from a <HI>voluntary pur|po&s;e</HI> to <HI>exert</HI> and <HI>di&s;play</HI> His Glorious Per|fections, and communicate of His Goodne&s;s. <HI>For his Plea&s;ure all things are and were created,</HI> Rev. 4.11.

Now God being an <HI>Infinitely</HI> wi&s;e Agent, had laid the Plan or Scheme of His Work, before he &s;et upon doing it: all his Works <HI>ad ex|tra,</HI> in <HI>Creating</HI> and <HI>Governing</HI> the World, are but the <HI>Execution</HI> of His Antecedent Eternal <HI>Purpo&s;es.</HI> For, <HI>known unto him are all his Works from the Foundation of the World,</HI> Act. 15.18. <HI>He works all things according to the Coun&s;el of his own will,</HI> Eph. 1.11.

In|a&s;much therefore as all his <HI>Works</HI> referring to his <HI>Creatures,</HI> are but the Executions of his Antecedent Eternal <HI>Purpo&s;es,</HI> it thence follows, that his making of Men, and his be&s;towing Benefits on them; are but the product or execution of his Eternal Coun&s;els.

It's of So|veraign Divine Bounty and Goodne&s;s,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That God has given His Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to Die for the Salvation of Sinful Men.</HI> All Men by Sinning again&s;t God, by breaking his holy Law; became ju&s;tly obnoxious to Everla&s;ting Vengence, Wrath and Mi&s;ery.

And it could not <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> be any thing el&s;e, but mo&s;t Free, Soveraign Bounty and Goodne&s;s in God, that put him upon &s;uch a Method as this.

<P N="3">3. <HI>That He has put &s;uch a connexion as He has, between Mens Duties, and the benefits which will thence accrue to them.</HI> Ina&s;much as God is the Soveraign Maker of all Men, does hold their Souls in Life, and pre&s;erve their Spirits and all their powers of Operation; ina&s;much as they thus intirely depend on the Soveraign plea&s;ure of God, it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that 'tis their indi&s;pen&s;able duty to imploy them&s;elves and all their Powers for God, conformably to the di&s;coveries of his preceptive Will unto them. They're indi&s;|pen&s;ably obliged to this, from the Relation there is between them and their Creator, and from the dependence they have on him for their Being and Operation; whether he had promis'd any Reward to their Obedience or not. 'Twas therefore an effect of Soveraign Bounty, rather than of <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>&s;trict</HI> Ju&s;tice, that God promis'd an endle&s;s happy Life to innocent Man (as is plainly implied in the

fir&s;t Threatning, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17.) if he had con|tinued perfectly obedient. For if innocent Man had long continued perfectly Obedient to his Ma&s;ters Will; this would have been no more than what he was indi&s;pen&s;ably ob|lig'd to, from his relation to God as his bountiful Creator and Pre&s;erver: nor could God have thence been oblig'd to continue him longer in being, or be&s;tow further Be|nefits on him, unle&s;s by his own free &s;overaign promi&s;e he had &s;o oblig'd Him&s;elf. Surely then, &s;ince Man is faln, it mu&s;t needs be of Gods Free, Soveraign Grace and Bounty, that in and thro' the Mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he puts a connexion between Man's Duty and the Benefits which will thence ac|crue to Him. If we judge rightly, we mu&s;t needs own, 'tis Soveraign Goodne&s;s in God that he'll &s;toop to treat with Rebels, through a Mediator of his own appointing; and that when he might glorify him&s;elf in their de|&s;erved De&s;truction, he promi&s;eth to re|ceive them to favour and make 'em Eter|nally happy, if they'll return and &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t rea&s;onable and gracious Terms which he offers to them. Yet he does &s;o. For <HI>thro' Chri&s;t he is reconciling the World to him|&s;elf.</HI> He does not bid any to &s;eek him in vain; but declares, <HI>there's Forgivene&s;s with him that he may be feared,</HI> P&s;al. 130.4.

Bounty and Goodne&s;s, that he be&s;tows on the Children of Men, all the benefits or good things they at any time receive.</P>
<P>The <HI>USE</HI> of the&s;e things may be in the following Inferences, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We ought to contemplate on and admire at, the free &s;overaign bounty of God.</HI> There can|not be a more noble Subject of our mo&s;t frequent and &s;erious Contemplation. When here and there a few among Mortals, exceed their Neighbours in Ability, Vertue, Good|ne&s;s, U&s;efulne&s;s; they're often much &s;poken of and commended by tho&s;e, who&s;e good Opinion is of any worth; I &s;ay, 'tis often tho' not always thus. But all the communi|cative Goodne&s;s in any Creatures, is not &s;o much compar'd to the Goodne&s;s manife&s;ted by God; as the glittering of a glow-worm, compar'd to the diffu&s;ive exten&s;ive Light of the Sun. Surely our Souls &s;hould &s;tand, look, gaze and wonder at the free exten&s;ive, tho' Incomprehen&s;ible Goodne&s;s of the Eter|nal Jehovah. Who can tell the Number, or the ten thou&s;andth part, of tho&s;e Benefits which he freely be&s;tows? Surely, no Mans Arithmetick can reach to this. His won|derful works of Goodne&s;s can't be reckon'd up in order, they're more than can be num|bred. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 40.5. But tho' we can't mea|&s;ure the heigth or depth, length or breadth of tho&s;e &s;treams i&s;&s;uing from Soveraign Di|vine Goodne&s;s, and to the mo&s;t unworthy too; yet we &s;hould greatly contemplate on

them, and admire the Immen&s;e Fountain and Original from whence they flow. This work, the bright Spirits above imploy them|&s;elves in; the more we abound in it the more we &s;hall be like them, and the fitter for their Company.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We &s;hould never murmur, though po&s;&s;ibly we may want &s;ome Comforts which we are de&s;irous of.</HI> God is the Author, yea, the free, &s;overeign Giver of all Benefits; And do we indeed de|&s;erve any good thing at his hand? No truly, we are &s;o far from that, that by our Sins we ju&s;tly de&s;erve his <HI>in&s;upportable Wrath for|ever.</HI> When Afflictions are mo&s;t and heavie&s;t upon us, even then 'tis much better with us than we de&s;erve. When God takes away our Health, our Ea&s;e, our deare&s;t Friends and Relatives, or any other Comforts; he does but recall what he freely lent us <HI>during his Plea&s;ure,</HI> &s;o he can do us no wrong herein; and therefore we never have any cau&s;e to re|pine or murmur. Nay, we are &s;o far from having any real cau&s;e of Murmuring, that when we meet with the mo&s;t grievous Emp|tyings and Lo&s;&s;es, there are yet freely con|tinued to us, &s;o many and great Benefits, as loudly call for our <HI>Prai&s;ing and Adoring</HI> the &s;overeign Author of them. <HI>It is of the Lords Mercy we are not con&s;umed.</HI> Therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We &s;hould be con&s;tantly Thankful to God, for the diffu&s;ive Streams of his free Bounty to us.</HI> We can't reckon up the Number or de&s;cribe the Greatne&s;s of the&s;e Benefits, God freely

be&s;tows on each of us every Day. Every Breath we draw, is a renew'd In&s;tance of his amazing Power, Patience, and unde&s;erved Goodne&s;s. If it be not our own Fault, we may daily tru&s;t in God for, and delight our &s;elves with the Thoughts of, tho&s;e matchle&s;s, endle&s;s Joys, which his faithful Promi&s;e &s;e|cures to tho&s;e that rightly &s;eek after them. Then &s;ure I am, we &s;hould be daily and hear|tily Thankful to that God, who thus freely &s;howers down his Benefits on the Unworthy. <HI>In every thing give thanks, for this is the will of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us concerning you,</HI> 1 The&s;. 5.18. <HI>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father, in the name of our Lord Je&s;us Christ,</HI> Eph. 5.20. <HI>Ble&s;s the Lord, O my &s;oul, &amp; all that is with|in me, ble&s;s his holy name: Ble&s;s the Lord, O my &s;oul, and forget not all his benefits,</HI> P&s;al. 103.1, 2.

<P N="4">4. <HI>We &s;hould never envy to others the good Things they enjoy.</HI> Whence come tho&s;e good Thing? Why from God the Fountain of all good, and he may &s;urely do what he will with his own. He is the &s;overeign Potter, Creatures are the Clay; he may fa&s;hion this or that Lump into what Figure he plea&s;eth, and can be accountable to none for doing &s;o. If others have more Health, Ea&s;e, Honour, Power, Wealth, greater inward Gifts and Abilities or Endowments, more de&s;irable

The lowe&s;t Shrub &s;hould not envy the talle&s;t Cedar; nor the &s;malle&s;t Stars tho&s;e of the fir&s;t Magnitude, for all the Stars have that Mea&s;ure of Light, and keep the Orb and Sphere their wi&s;e, bountiful Maker a&s;&s;ign'd them.

<P N="5">5. <HI>Tho&s;e who excel others, &s;hould never be Proud of it.</HI> Who maketh thee to differ? If we have <HI>more Health, Wealth, Honour, Power</HI> than others; yet here's no ju&s;t Foundation for Self-conceit.

If we have <HI>greater Natural Abilities</HI> than others, God freely gave them, without any Means of our u&s;ing.

Thankfulne&s;s. Nay, If we are &s;incerely Pi|ous and Godly, and have done much <HI>greater Service,</HI> and many more good Deeds than o|thers; yet here's nothing to be <HI>Proud</HI> of.

it. For Gods Offers of &s;aving Mercy, are mo&s;t free, gracious, &s;overeign; and his Promi&s;es which contain them are infallibly true. Therefore, together with utmo&s;t loath|ing of our Sins, we &s;hould all of us be en|courag'd &s;peedily, fully, firmly to tru&s;t in the Sovereign Grace of God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for all that Pardon, Grace and Sal|vation which we need. God is &s;uch a So|veraign Fountain of Good, and &s;o delights in Mercy; that we can't po&s;&s;ibly plea&s;e him more, than by thus <HI>tru&s;ting</HI> in him for pro|mi&s;ed benefits, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 147.11. <HI>The Lord taketh plea&s;ure in them that fear him, in tho&s;e that hope in his mercy, Abraham</HI> was <HI>&s;trong in Faith giving glory to God,</HI> Rom. 4.20.

<P N="7">7. <HI>We &s;hould freely and readily do as much Good as ever we can.</HI> The more we do &s;o, &s;o much the more like we are to God.

Yea, <HI>as we have opportunity we &s;hould do good to all men, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e of the hou&s;hold of Faith,</HI> Gal. 6.10.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Tho&s;e mu&s;t needs be happy, who have God for their God and Portion.</HI> This is the ca&s;e, of all &s;incere Believers in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.

<HEAD><HI>QUESTION I.</HI> What's meant by Chri&s;tians working out their Salvation?</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion, is <HI>Nega|tive</HI>; it does not mean that they &s;hould or can, purcha&s;e, merit or de&s;erve any part of their Salvation. Sinners have merited Damnation, by breaking Gods Law; but
<PB N="130" REF="001936_0136_0FBA31F5B670D038">
they cannot merit Salvation, by any or by all their doings and &s;ufferings. Indeed Je|&s;us Chri&s;t has merited Salvation, for all tho&s;e who &s;hall obtain it; yet tho&s;e who receive it, do not de&s;erve it. 'Tis Gods free Gift to them, Luk, 12.32. <HI>It is your Fathers good plea&s;ure to give you the Kingdom. The Gift of God is Eternal Life,</HI> Rom. 6.23. This Sal|vation is purcha&s;ed <HI>for,</HI> but not <HI>by,</HI> tho&s;e who obtain it. As it comes from God, from Chri&s;t to them, 'tis a <HI>Gift,</HI> 'tis the fruit of meer, free, &s;overeign Love, Grace and no|thing el&s;e. There are &s;ome Qualifications nece&s;&s;ary to be found in Per&s;ons, in order to their compleat Salvation; as Faith, Re|pentance, Holine&s;s, without the&s;e no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord. Yet the&s;e Inherent qua|lifications, do not merit or de&s;erve Happi|ne&s;s; they are rather <HI>parts</HI> of the Sinners Salvation, and preparatory to the perfection of it. And even the&s;e qualifications, are al&s;o the <HI>Gifts</HI> of God. So is <HI>Repentance</HI> (Act. 5.31.) and <HI>Faith,</HI> (Eph. 2.8.) it is of Chri&s;ts fulne&s;s, that Per&s;ons receive Grace for Grace. He is the Spring and Fountain of their Grace and Holine&s;s: he works in them both to will and to do of his own good Plea&s;ure. So that the Sinner's perfect com|pleat Salvation, is Gods Gift; all tho&s;e qua|lifications in the Soul which are nece&s;&s;ary hereunto, are al&s;o Gods Gifts: therefore the Sinner cannot purcha&s;e, merit or de&s;erve Sal|vation.

<P><PB N="163" REF="001936_0169_0FBA323E5E7DFC08">Alas, it's utterly impo&s;&s;ible fully to ex|pre&s;s or de&s;cribe, that &s;elf-emptying, &s;elf-loathing frame of Soul for Sin, that always becomes a true Chri&s;tian. There's no Grace more Ornamental to a Saint, than <HI>Humility</HI>; and nothing tends more directly to bring this into Exerci&s;e, than the remembrace of our Sins. Can we have high thoughts of our &s;elves? Nay, how can we have any other, but low, mean, &s;elf-aba&s;ing thoughts; when we con&s;ider how di&s;ingenious, ba&s;e, un|grateful, and di&s;obedient we have been to our mo&s;t merciful and gracious God? May we not well &s;ay with him, P&s;al. 73.22. <HI>So fooli&s;h was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast be|fore thee.</HI> Prov. 30.2. <HI>Surely, I am more brui|ti&s;h than any man, I have not the under&s;tanding of a man.</HI> I&s;ai. 6.5. &mdash;<HI>Wo is me, for I am un|done, becau&s;e I am a man of unclean lips.</HI> A due remembrance, a deep &s;en&s;e of Sin, would make us more humble; indeed more low, mean and ba&s;e in our own minds and thoughts, than could po&s;&s;ibly be expre&s;s'd by our words.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Should make Chri&s;tians very thankful for all their Mercies, as free Gifts of God.

Have we Life, Liberty, Health. Strength, Food, Raiment, Friends, Relations, Reputa|tion, any Outward Comfort or true Inward
<PB N="164" REF="001936_0170_0FBA323FCCBA4D00">
Peace? Have we all or any of the&s;e things? Why the&s;e are all the free Gifts of God, we never de&s;erv'd the lea&s;t part of any one of them. We were no &s;ooner Chil|dren, than we were <HI>Children of Wrath,</HI> Eph. 2.3. We have de&s;erv'd Death, Hell, Damna|tion thou&s;ands of times over by our Sins. It's of the Lords Mercy we are not con|&s;umed for our Iniquities: what&s;oever we have on this &s;ide Eternal Burnings, un|quenchible Flames, is meer unde&s;erved Mer|cy, its the free Gift of God. And we &s;hould really think and e&s;teem it &s;o, if we had but a due remembrance of our Sins. Since there|fore we have by our Sins times without number de&s;erved Eternal Mi&s;ery, and are yet &s;urrounded with innumerable Mercies, all of which are the free under&s;erved Fa|vours of God; O how thankful &s;hould we be? Surely it becomes us to &s;ay, <HI>What &s;hall we render to the Lord for all his Benefits,</HI> for all his under&s;erved Benefits towards us? There are two &s;orts of things which we <HI>cannot number</HI> they are &s;o many, and tho&s;e are, <HI>our Sins</HI> again&s;t God, and <HI>his Benefits</HI> be|&s;tow'd on us; this is wonderful indeed. Surely we &s;hould be deeply <HI>humble</HI> for the former; and as <HI>thankful</HI> for the latter. None are more thankful for their Mercies, than tho&s;e who are mo&s;t deeply humble and pe|nitent at the remembrance of their Sins. Remembrance of pa&s;t Sins,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Should make Chri&s;tians thankful to God for Re&s;training Grace.</HI> Have we been guilty &s;o
<PB N="165" REF="001936_0171_0FBA3242D8D66DD0">
much as any one &s;ingle time, of di&s;obeying our Parents or other lawful Superiors, of profaning Gods Holy Name, of groundle&s;s Quarrelling, of Intemperance, Uncleanne&s;s, Lying, Pa&s;&s;ionate &s;peaking and reviling? Do we remember that &s;o much as at any one &s;ingle time, we have been guilty of any one of the&s;e, or any &s;uch like Crimes? Then how comes it about, that we have not con|&s;tantly lived in them? We have a root of bitterne&s;s, a &s;inful corrupt Nature &s;till dwelling in us, our particular acts of Sin did flow from this corrupt Nature. <HI>Out of the Heart proceed evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulte|ries, &amp;c.</HI> Well, how comes it to pa&s;s, that this bitter corrupt Fountain did not always even continually, &s;end forth &s;uch cur&s;ed Streams? How comes it about, that we have not in the whole cour&s;e of our Lives, lived in the mo&s;t flagitious Crimes, and mo&s;t &s;candalous Immoralities; for our corrupt Nature has in it, the root and &s;eed of all manner of Abominations? Why 'tis the Grace of God that has kept us from Sinning, and nothing el&s;e has re&s;train'd us when we had an opportunity of Sinning. I dont mean, true &s;anctifying &s;aving Grace: many are re&s;train'd from the&s;e and tho&s;e out-breakings of Sin, which have no &s;aving Grace in them. Well, &s;o far as we have been re&s;train'd from Sinning, it is God that has re&s;train'd us. He that kept back <HI>Abimelech</HI> from <HI>de|filing of Abrahams Wife</HI>; and <HI>David</HI> from <HI>&s;hed|ding the Blood of Nabal</HI>; has kept us back from all tho&s;e Sins we have not committed,
<PB N="166" REF="001936_0172_0FBA32475216A938">
tho' we had an opportunity of committing them. When we remember how &s;hamefully our Corruption has broken forth, we &s;hould be thankful for that Grace, which has re|&s;train'd it from breaking forth much more than it has. The <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> &s;aid, Luk. 18.11. <HI>God I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, Extortioners, Unju&s;t, Adulterers, &amp;c.</HI> Tho' we &s;hould not (like this Phari&s;ee) proudly tru&s;t in our &s;elves as righteous, if we have been outwardly more blamele&s;s than others; yet if we can as to matter of fact truly &s;ay with him. <HI>We have not been &s;o wicked as others,</HI> then we &s;hould be <HI>humbly thankful for it.</HI> As we &s;hould with brokenne&s;s of Heart and deepe&s;t &s;elf-aba&s;ement of Soul, remember and repent of our pa&s;t Sins; &s;o with true thankfulne&s;s of Heart, we &s;hould acknow|ledge the re&s;traints of Divine Grace, that have kept us from the more abundant out-breakings of our Corruption. It's matter of great thankfulne&s;s to God, that we are not all of us Murderers, Adulterers, Bla&s;phemers; that we are not the mo&s;t abominable Villains that ever liv'd on Gods Earth, for we &s;hould have been internally and externally as vile and wicked, as ever we had any po&s;&s;ible op|portunity of being, if Grace had not pre|vented and re&s;trained us. I have often thought, it's a great favour, an in&s;tance of the merciful Divine Protection, when Per|&s;ons can in the Morning go out about their Affairs, and come &s;afe home at Night, with|out <HI>broken Bones</HI> or any <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Accidents.</HI> But I have often thought al&s;o, that it's &s;till
<PB N="167" REF="001936_0173_0FBA324905A1BA08">
a much greater Mercy, when they can thus go out in the Morning and come home at Night; without having committed Adultery, Murder, Theft, or &s;ome daring and heinous Crime or other, &s;ince they have continually a corrupt Nature (the &s;eed and root of all manner of wickedne&s;s) in them. When we remember, and mo&s;t heartily abhor and mourn for our pa&s;t Sins; let us al&s;o be thankful to God, that he has re&s;train'd and kept us back from Sin &s;o much as he has done. The Remembrance of pa&s;t Sins,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Should keep Chri&s;tians from murmuring at their Afflictions.</HI> It's a thing too frequent, even in Gods own Children, to fret, mur|mur, repine at afflictive Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence. <HI>Jacob</HI> once complained of his Afflictions; &s;aying, <HI>All the&s;e things are again&s;t me,</HI> Gen. 42.36. The <HI>Church</HI> complained and and &s;aid, Lam. 1.12. &mdash; <HI>Behold and &s;ee, if there be any &s;orrow like unto my &s;orrow.</HI> Afflicti|ons brought both <HI>Job</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah</HI> to <HI>cur&s;e the Day of their Birth.</HI> How commonly will Chri&s;tians tell of their <HI>Sickne&s;s, Poverty, Lo&s;&s;es, Cro&s;&s;es, Di&s;appointments,</HI> bitterly complaining of their Trials, &s;howing great Di&s;content and Di&s;quietne&s;s of Mind thereat? This is a great Fault; it's a greater Sin than many are aware of, for Per&s;ons to fault and quar|rel with the &s;potle&s;s Di&s;pen&s;ations of Sove|reign Divine Providence. Well, one thing that occa&s;ions this Di&s;content and Murmur|ing is, the forgetting our own Sins. If we duely remembred our pa&s;t Sins, our multi|plyed,

<P>That <HI>great is the Danger</HI> of tho&s;e who walk on in ways of Sin, will appear if we con&s;ider the&s;e following Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God perfestly and exactly knows all their Wickedne&s;s.</HI> Per&s;ons may po&s;&s;ibly keep many of their Crimes &s;ecret from Men; they often &s;trive to do &s;o. Job 24.15. <HI>The Eye al&s;o of the Adulterer waiteth for the Twilight, &s;aying, no Eye &s;hall &s;ee me; and di&s;gui&s;eth his Face.</HI> But no Crime can po&s;&s;ibly be kept &s;ecret from God; he perfectly and truely knows all the Thoughts, Words, Ways of all the Children of Men: He knows all the &s;ecret Springs and Motives of their Actions, what|ever <HI>their Pretences</HI> are. <HI>The Eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</HI> Prov. 15.3. <HI>There is no creature that is not manifest in his &s;ight; all things are open and naked to the eyes of him with whom we have to do,</HI> Heb. 14.23. God perfectly knows all
<PB N="178" REF="001936_0184_0FBA325D12166EA0">
the Sins of <HI>every Per&s;on,</HI> the Time when, the Place where they were committed; and all Aggravations and Circum&s;tances attending them. <HI>Can any hide him&s;elf in &s;ecret places, that I &s;hall not &s;ee him? &s;aith the Lord. Do not I fill Heaven and Earth? &s;aith the Lord,</HI> Jer. 23.24.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God exactly remembers all their Sins.</HI> Some|times the ill Actions of Per&s;ons are much talk'd of when newly committed, but in a while there's a great &s;ilence about them, they're much forgotten. Nay, Per&s;ons frequently forget many of their own Words and Acti|ons, bad as well as good. But God perfectly and exactly remembers all the Sins of all Per&s;ons. Indeed when he Pardons the Sins of true Penitents, he is &s;aid <HI>not to remember them any more,</HI> Jer. 31.34. This &s;ignifies, that he'll never inflict the puni&s;hment de&s;erv'd by their Sins. But Gods Knowledge being Infinite and Perfect, in &s;trict and proper &s;peaking, he cannot really forget or let &s;lip out of his Me|mory or Knowledge, any thing that ever he has known. Therefore as he perfectly <HI>knows</HI> all the Sins of the wicked; &s;o he per|fectly and exactly <HI>remembers</HI> them all, and that <HI>continually. Job</HI> &s;aid to God, Job 14.16, 17. <HI>For now thou numbre&s;t my &s;teps, do&s;t thou not watch over my Sin? My tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is &s;ealed up in a bag, and thou &s;owe&s;t up mine iniquity.</HI> God &s;ays concerning the wickedne&s;s of his People, Deut. 32.34. <HI>Is not this laid up in &s;tore with me, and &s;ealed up among my trea&s;ures?</HI> Men often &s;tore and trea&s;ure up things in

<HI>Bags,</HI> and <HI>Seal</HI> them; that they may <HI>keep them &s;afely</HI> and have <HI>them forth coming</HI> upon occa|&s;ion: in allu&s;ion hereto, God is &s;aid to <HI>Seal up the Sins of the wicked.</HI> It notes his full, exact knowledge and remembrance of them. Oh Sinner, God remembers all thy pa&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, every one of them, with all their aggravations; all the vanities and fol|lies of thy <HI>Childhood, Youth</HI> and <HI>Riper Age.</HI> It may be many Years ago, thou ha&s;t been guilty of <HI>Drunken Bouts, Unclean Practices,</HI> of vile <HI>Cur&s;ing and Swearing,</HI> of <HI>Profaning the Sab|bath,</HI> of <HI>Cheating Tricks,</HI> of <HI>mad abominable Frolicks, &amp;c.</HI> Well, God exactly remembers all the&s;e, whether thou do&s;t or no: they're as fre&s;h and plain in God's View and Me|mory, as if committed <HI>but this very Moment</HI>; and if thou ha&s;t not heartily repented, then the guilt of the&s;e and all other thy tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, remains in full force upon thee. Hence Sinners are &s;aid, <HI>to trea&s;ure up wrath again&s;t the day of wrath, and the revelation of Gods righteous judgment,</HI> Rom. 2.5. As they add Sin to Sin, &s;o they <HI>trea&s;ure up</HI> yet greater and greater <HI>mea&s;ures of Wrath</HI> and Vengeance; which &s;hall &s;urely be poured out upon them, if Repentance prevent not. <HI>Time,</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly wear out thy remembrance of thy Sins, but it can never wear out God's remembrance of them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>God hates all Sin.</HI> He is <HI>of purer eyes than to behold evil: he cannot look upon ini|quity,</HI> Hab. 1.13. This alludes to the practice of Men, when they <HI>&s;hut their Eyes</HI>

or <HI>turn away their Faces,</HI> as not being able to bear or endure the &s;ight of the&s;e or tho&s;e Objects, which are loath&s;om, hateful and abominable to them. Men can't endure to &s;ee the&s;e or tho&s;e things, which they hate and loath. So, God is &s;aid to be of &s;uch holy and pure Eyes, that he can't bear the &s;ight of Sin. The Expre&s;&s;ion notes, his un|utterable hatred, loathing and abhorrence of it. He declares, that 'tis <HI>the abominable thing which he hates,</HI> Jer. 44.4. No Objects we can think of, can be &s;o hateful and loath&s;ome to us, as all Sin is to God. Nothing can be &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing and provoking to us, as all Sin is to God. It is becau&s;e God's <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> hates Sin; that his <HI>Power</HI> has made an Hell to puni&s;h it. Indeed Sin is the only thing that's loath&s;ome, hateful and provoking to God; and all Sin is inconceivably abomina|ble to him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>God has threatned to puni&s;h Sin, and he is faithful it his Word.</HI> While Man was Inno|cent, God threatned Death in ca&s;e of Di&s;|obedience, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. And the Scripture plainly declares, <HI>the Soul that &s;ins &s;hall Die,</HI> Ezek. 18.4. <HI>The wages of Sin is Death,</HI> Rom. 6.23. Every Sin is Trea&s;on and Rebellion again&s;t God, and de&s;erves Death; even E|ternal Death and Mi&s;ery. And if Sin be not &s;o Repented of, as to be Pardoned thro' the Blood of Chri&s;t, Eternal Death and Mi&s;ery &s;hall certainly be inflicted for it: for <HI>God is faithful to his Word. He cannot lie,</HI> Tit. 1.2. <HI>God is not a man that he &s;hould repent. Hath

be &s;aid, and &s;hall he not do it? or hath he &s;po|ken, and &s;hall he not make it good?</HI> Numb. 23.19. <HI>It is impo&s;&s;ible for God to lie,</HI> Heb. 6.18. God is Unchangibly true and faith|ful, and therefore his <HI>threatenings</HI> (if Repen|tance prevent not) as well as his <HI>Promi&s;es,</HI> &s;hall certainly be accompli&s;hed.

<P N="5">5. <HI>God has power &s;ufficient to puni&s;h Sin, to fulfil all his Threatnings again&s;t it.</HI> Among Men, Judges &s;ometimes <HI>want Power</HI> to inflict de&s;erved Puni&s;hments on Offenders; God can never want Power &s;o to do, for he is <HI>the Lord God Omnipotent.

Thou art ab&s;olutely and intirely in the hand of that God, whom thou provoke&s;t with thy wickedne&s;s; he can end thy Life and &s;end thee to Hell in a Moment, if he plea&s;eth.

But on the other hand, if any <HI>from Fear of worldly Troubles,</HI> or <HI>from Love to worldly Pro&s;perity,</HI> &s;hould neglect to be the &s;incere Di&s;ciples and Followers of Chri&s;t, they, though they &s;hould be &s;uppos'd to gain the <HI>whole World,</HI> would yet be <HI>mi&s;erable Lo&s;ers</HI> at the la&s;t, for they would <HI>lo&s;e their own Souls</HI>; that is, be <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e|rable for ever.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is both God and Man in One Per&s;on.</HI> He is the <HI>Only begotten Son of God,</HI> Joh. 3.16.

<P N="2">2. <HI>This Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall Judge the World.</HI> All the World of Mankind, all Hu|mane Per&s;ons that ever were in the World, or ever &s;hall be in it, &s;hall be called into Judgment, and Doom'd to a &s;tate of endle&s;s <HI>Mi&s;ery or Glory,</HI> according to what their be|haviour was while they liv'd <HI>here upon Earth.</HI> And the Per&s;on that &s;hall be the Supream, Univer&s;al Judge of all, that &s;hall hear all Cau&s;es, and determine whether they're good or bad, and <HI>pronounce</HI> Sentence on each Per&s;on accordingly; I &s;ay, the Per&s;on that &s;hall thus Judge the World, is the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>God&mdash; hath appointed a day, in which he will Judge the World in righteou&s;ne&s;s, by the Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given a&s;&s;urance to all men, in that he hath rai&s;ed him from the Dead,</HI> Act 17.30, 31.

Chri&s;t as a Divine Per&s;on, had Divine Glo|ry before Creatures ever had a being. Our Saviour a little before his Death, made that Prayer to God, Joh. 17.5. <HI>And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own &s;elf, with the glory which I had with thee before the World was.</HI> Whether the <HI>Glory</HI> in which Chri&s;t will come to Judge the World, is in our Text call'd the <HI>Glory of the Father,</HI> becau&s;e the Father by an Eternal and Ineffable Gene|ration communicates the Divine Nature and Glory to the Son; or whether, becau&s;e Chri&s;t as Mediator is commi&s;&s;ioned by the Father to Judge the World; I &s;ay, whether it be in the one or other, of the&s;e re&s;pects, we need not di&s;pute, tho' I &s;ee no cau&s;e to reject ei|ther of them. <HI>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all Judgment to the Son,</HI> Joh. 5.22.

<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE, II.</HI> He will then Reward every Man according to his Works.</HEAD>
<P>Our Text expre&s;ly declares this to us; and for the illu&s;trating and further clearing of it, we may con&s;ider the following Particu|lars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>All the Dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed.</HI> When Per&s;ons die, their Rational Souls <HI>parting from their Bodies</HI> (which Separation is Death) their Bodies then are u&s;ually buried in the Earth, where they Rot and return to Du&s;t. Gen. 3.19. <HI>Du&s;t thou art, and unto du&s;t &s;hall thou return.</HI> When a Per&s;on dies, <HI>then &s;hall the du&s;t return to the Earth as it was, and the &s;pi|rit return unto God who gave it,</HI> Eccl. 12.7. But though the dead Bodies of Men &s;hall Rot, return to their Du&s;t; or though being drowned in the Sea, &s;hall be eaten by Fi&s;h|es; yet all the&s;e dead Bodies, both of the Godly and Ungodly, &s;hall be rai&s;ed again, they &s;hall live again, &s;hall be re-united to tho&s;e Souls which formerly dwelt in them, and &s;hall abide united to them for ever. This <HI>Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection of the Dead,</HI> is known only by Divine Revelation; there|fore our Saviour refers us to the <HI>Scriptures</HI> as the only <HI>proper Proof</HI> of it: For he &s;aid to the <HI>Sadduces,</HI> who <HI>denyed the Re&s;urrection,</HI> Mat.
<PB N="203" REF="001936_0209_0FBA2E209E029630">
22.29. <HI>Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the Power of God.</HI> God who is infinitely Wi&s;e, Powerful and Faithful, has declared in the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> that the Dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed; there|fore we have the highe&s;t Ground and Rea|&s;on firmly to believe that it &s;hall be &s;o. Tho' if Men would give way to their &s;hort-&s;ighted, carnal Rea&s;on, they might make Ob|jections again&s;t the Re&s;urrection, or fruitle&s;s Queries about the Way, Manner and Cir|cum&s;tances of it; yet 'twould be fooli&s;h &s;o to do. Acts 26.8. <HI>Why &s;hould it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God &s;hould rai&s;e the dead</HI>? It's incredible indeed that <HI>Men</HI> (by any meer Power of their own) &s;hould rai&s;e the Dead; but not incredible that GOD &s;hould do &s;o. 1 Cor. 15.35, 36. <HI>But &s;ome Man will &s;ay, how are the dead rai&s;ed up, and with what Body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou &s;owe&s;t is not quickened, except it die.</HI> According to Scripture Language, that Man is a <HI>Fool</HI> who denies the Re&s;urrection, or makes any doubting, needle&s;s Queries about the Way, Manner, Circum&s;tances of it. What God has plainly declar'd, we &s;hould firmly believe. Now he has plainly declar'd, Joh. 5.28, 29. <HI>The hour is coming, in the which all that are in their Graves &s;hall hear his voice; and &s;hall come forth, they that have done good to the Re&s;urrection of Life, and they that have done evil to the Re&s;urrection of Damnation.</HI> Acts 24.15. &mdash; <HI>There &s;hall be a Re&s;urrection of the dead, both of the Ju&s;t and unju&s;t.</HI> Rev. 20.13. <HI>And the Sea gave up the dead which were in it; and Death and Hell delivered up the dead which were

<P N="1"><PB N="256" REF="001936_0262_0FBA2ECDCEE5B498">1. <HI>That God has made plentiful Provi&s;ion for the Comfort of his Saints, even while they abide in this pre&s;ent evil World.</HI> It's true, this is not their Home nor Re&s;ting Place, they are <HI>Strangers, Sojourners, Pilgrims</HI> upon Earth; yet God has made &s;uch <HI>Di&s;coveries of his Mind</HI> to them, as gives them abundant Ground even for <HI>pre|&s;ent Comfort.</HI> If they meet with great and &s;ud|den Afflictions, they need not be <HI>&s;urpriz'd</HI> nor <HI>frighted</HI>; for God has forewarn'd them, that &s;uch is the State and Cour&s;e of this <HI>pre&s;ent Life,</HI> and that <HI>in the World they &s;hall have Tribulation.</HI> He has told them al&s;o, that they &s;hould <HI>com|mit the keeping of their Souls to him; ca&s;t all their Cares and Burdens upon him, for he'll care for them and &s;u&s;tain them</HI>; and will <HI>make all things work for their Good,</HI> and <HI>guide them by Coun&s;el, till he brings them to Glory.</HI> The&s;e &amp; &s;uch like gra|cious Promi&s;es, give them abundant Ground for <HI>pre&s;ent Peace, Joy, Comfort</HI> in their own Souls, whatever <HI>outward Troubles</HI> they meet with. Therefore when they are bid to <HI>rejoyce in the Lord always,</HI> 'tis no Mockery, no Je&s;t, nor hard Saying; its no more than what the faithful, gracious Promi&s;es of God, give them <HI>&s;ufficient Ground for.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.8. <HI>Whom having not &s;een ye love; in whom, tho' now you &s;ee him not, yet be|lieving, ye rejoyce with Joy un&s;peakable and full of Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Unbelief is the greate&s;t Plague and Mi&s;chief the Saints have in the World.</HI> There may be <HI>Truth</HI> of Faith, where there is <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> of Faith. Our Saviour once &s;aid to the great Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> Mat. 14.31. <HI>O thou of little Faith, wherefore did&s;t thou doubt?</HI> The <HI>be&s;t Believers in the World,</HI> have
<PB N="257" REF="001936_0263_0FBA2ED3B00FB600">
&s;ome Unbelief in them; and it <HI>prevails more</HI> at &s;ome times than at others. And this Unbe|lief is their <HI>greate&s;t</HI> Plague and Mi&s;chief. The lively Exerci&s;e of Faith, does as it were feeling|ly unite the Soul to God in Chri&s;t, as the Al|&s;ufficient Fountain of <HI>Light, Life, Love, Grace,</HI> and all Good; and how <HI>profitable</HI> and <HI>comforta|ble</HI> mu&s;t this needs be? The lively Exerci&s;e of Faith may &s;how the Saint, that <HI>all things are his, whether Life, Death, things pre&s;ent, or things to come; &amp; he is Chri&s;t's, &amp; Chri&s;t is God's,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.21, 23. But Unbelief, &s;o far as that prevails, it <HI>&s;eparates</HI> the Soul from God the Fountain of all Good. Heb 3.12. <HI>Take heed le&s;t there be in any of you an evil Heart of Unbelief, in departing from the living God.</HI> An <HI>unbelieving Heart,</HI> is an <HI>evil Heart.</HI> Why &s;o? Why, becau&s;e it <HI>departs from the living God</HI>: That mu&s;t needs be very Evil, which <HI>departs</HI> from the Fountain of all Good and Grace. Therefore the Saints &s;hould <HI>take heed</HI> at &s;uch an Heart, to avoid it: Be not faithle&s;s but believing.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We &s;hould all of us believe and tru&s;t in God, in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> It's <HI>our Duty, our Intere&s;t</HI> to do &s;o. 1 Joh. 3.23. <HI>This is his Commandment, that we &s;hould believe in the name of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Sin|ners, the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> &s;hould forthwith Repent of all their Sins, and tru&s;t in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> for Salvation; they Provoke God and Ruin their own Souls, if they neglect it. Oh <HI>Dreadful</HI> Evils! 1 Joh. 5.10. <HI>He that believeth not God, hath made him a Lyar, becau&s;e he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son.</HI> Mark 16.16. <HI>He that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> On the other hand, Sinners cannot po&s;&s;ibly plea&s;e God, or

profit them&s;elves, in any thing, like penitent|ly tru&s;ting in his Mercy in Chri&s;t for Salva|tion. P&s;al. 147.11. <HI>The Lord takes plea&s;ure in them that fear him, in them that hope in his Mercy.</HI> Joh. 3.16. <HI>Who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hall not peri&s;h, but &s;hall have Everla&s;ting Life.</HI> The Saints al|&s;o &s;hould be in the con&s;tant Exerci&s;e of live|ly Faith; firmly Realizing Gods Revealed Truths, and firmly Tru&s;ting in him for pro|mi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ings. I&s;ai. 26.4. <HI>Tru&s;t in the Lord for ever; for in the Lord Jehovah is everla&s;ting strength.</HI> Such Faith Glorifies God. <HI>Abraham was strong in Faith, giving glory to God,</HI> Rom 4.20. It is <HI>profitable</HI> to us. Jer. 17.7. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the Man that trusteth in the Lord, and who&s;e hope the Lord is.</HI> There is <HI>joy and peace in believing,</HI> Rom. 15.13. We &s;hould therefore check and rebuke our doubting, unbelieving Hearts; and &s;hould &s;tir up our &s;elves to take hold on God. P&s;al. 42.11. <HI>Why art thou ca&s;t down, O my &s;oul? And why art thou di&s;quieted within me? Hope thou in God.</HI> P&s;al. 27.14. <HI>Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he &s;hall &s;trengthen thine Heart; wait I &s;ay on the Lord.</HI> Lam. 3.25, 26. <HI>The Lord is good to them that wait for him, to the &s;oul that &s;eeketh him. It is good that a Man &s;hould both hope, and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord.</HI></P>
