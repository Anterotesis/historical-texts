<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is to be hoped, that no man, who believes a future &s;tate of exi&s;tence, will grudge the time and pains which are nece&s;&s;ary to obtain &s;atisfactory evidence concerning the nature of that &s;tate. A mi&s;take here may be fatal. If the doctrine advanced in the following pages be true, it is a mo&s;t important, a mo&s;t intere&s;ting doctrine. However contrary to the wi&s;hes of any, however mortifying to their feelings, however dreadful, it is by all means nece&s;&s;ary to be known. Surely no man would wi&s;h
<Q>to flatter him&s;elf in his own eyes, till his iniquity be found to be hateful.</Q>
To a rational and &s;criptural view of the truth in this ca&s;e, and to a &s;atisfactory &s;olution of the difficulties which have been objected to it, great attention and clo&s;e examination are nece&s;&s;ary. And whether both our duty and intere&s;t require us to &s;ubject our&s;elves to the labour of this atten|tion and examination, rather than to &s;it down ea&s;y in the expectation
<Q>of peace and &s;afety, till &s;udden de&s;truction come upon us;</Q>
no rational man can he&s;itate.</P>
<P>IF any object to the &s;ize of my book, my apologies are, the &s;ize of that to which it is intended as an an&s;wer, and the extent and importance of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>DOCTOR Chauncy's book is indeed anonymous. Yet, as I am informed, that he and his mo&s;t intimate friends have made no &s;ecret of the author's name; I pre&s;ume I need not apologize for u&s;ing the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible of the prejudice of many again&s;t contro|ver&s;y on religious &s;ubjects. But is it po&s;&s;ible in all ca&s;es to avoid it? What is controver&s;y properly managed, but ra|tional or argumentative di&s;cu&s;&s;ion? And is there to be no rational di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubjects of religion?&mdash;Heat and per&s;onal invective in &s;uch di&s;qui&s;itions are both impertinent and hurtful. But a cool di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the doctrines of reli|gion,
<PB N="iv" REF="022478_0003_0FB93545AF766400">
on the ground of rea&s;on and revelation, is undoubt|edly one of the be&s;t means of inve&s;tigating truth, of dif|fu&s;ing the knowledge of it, and of obtaining and giving &s;a|tisfaction with regard to the difficulties which attend many moral and religious &s;ubjects. This is the mode of di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, which I have endeavoured to ob&s;erve in the follow|ing pages. To point out the incon&s;i&s;tence and ab&s;urdity of an erroneous &s;y&s;tem, and even to &s;et them in the mo&s;t gla|ring light; is not at all incon&s;i&s;tent with this mode of di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion. If in any in&s;tances I have deviated from this mode, and in&s;tead of adhering clo&s;ely to the argument, have de&s;cended to per&s;onalities, and have endeavoured to bear hard on Dr. Chauncy, otherwi&s;e than by &s;howing the weakne&s;s and incon&s;i&s;tence of his arguments; for every &s;uch in&s;tance I a&s;k pardon of the reader, and al|low it is of no advantage to the cau&s;e which I e&s;pou&s;e. That cau&s;e mu&s;t be a bad one indeed, which cannot be &s;upported without the aid of per&s;onal reflections.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> In which the fundamental principles &amp;c. are pointed out &amp;c</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we enter into the con&s;ideration of the par|ticular arguments of Dr. Chauncy, it may be pro|per to give &s;ome account of the fundamental principles of his &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>BESIDE the doctrine of the &s;alvation of all men, to e&s;tabli&s;h which is the de&s;ign of his whole book; there are &s;everal other doctrines, which may be con&s;idered as fun|damental to his &s;y&s;tem. He does not deny all future pun|i&s;hment of the wicked; but allows that they will be pun|i&s;hed according to their demerits, or according to &s;trict ju&s;tice. Thus he allows that
<Q>many men will be mi&s;|erable in the next &s;tate of exi&s;tence, in proportion to the moral depravity they have contracted in this. There is no room for debate here<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page <HI>9.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
<Q>They mu&s;t be unavoidably mi&s;erable in proportion to the number and greatne&s;s of their vices<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 10.</NOTE>.</Q>
<Q>For the wages of &s;in is death; but the gift of GOD is eternal life through JESUS CHRIST our LORD: i. e. if men continue the &s;ervants of &s;in, the wages they &s;hall receive, before the gift through CHRIST is conferred on them, will be the &s;econd death<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 90.</NOTE>.</Q>
If &s;ome men &s;uffer that pun|i&s;hment which is the wages of &s;in, they doubtle&s;s &s;uffer all which they de&s;erve. No man de&s;erves more than his <HI>wages.</HI>
<Q>In the collective &s;en&s;e, they will be tormented for ages of ages; though &s;ome of them only &s;hould be tormented through the whole of that period; <HI>the re&s;t</HI> variou&s;ly as

to time, <HI>in proportion to their de&s;erts</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 307.</NOTE>.</Q>
<Q>There &s;hall be a difference in the puni&s;hment of wicked men, <HI>according to</HI> the difference there has been <HI>in the nature and number of their evil deeds</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Page <HI>320.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
He &s;peaks of the wic|ked as liable
<Q>to po&s;itive torments awfully great in de|gree, and long in continuance, <HI>in proportion to the num|ber and greatne&s;s of their crimes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 350, 351.</NOTE>.</Q>
<Q>The pardona|blene&s;s of all other &s;ins and bla&s;phemies,</Q>
[except that again&s;t the HOLY GHOST]
<Q>lies in this, its being po&s;|&s;ible for men, to e&s;cape the torments of hell, though they &s;hould have been guilty of tho&s;e &s;ins.&mdash;Accord|ingly the unpardonablene&s;s of the bla&s;phemy again&s;t the HOLY GHOST, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in the rever&s;e of the pardonablene&s;s of other &s;ins&mdash;in the impo&s;&s;ibility of their e&s;caping the torments of hell, who are charge|able with this &s;in.&mdash;This now being the meaning of the unpardonabne&s;s of bla&s;phemy again&s;t the HOLY GHOST, it is quite ea&s;y to perceive, that even the&s;e bla&s;phemers, notwith&s;tanding the unpardonablene&s;s of the &s;in they have committed, may finally be &s;aved &mdash;For if they are not &s;aved till after they have pa&s;&s;ed through the&s;e torments, they have never been forgiven&mdash; <HI>The divine law has taken its cour&s;e;</HI> nor has any inter|vening pardon prevented <HI>the full execution of the threat|ened penalty on them.</HI>&mdash;Forgivene&s;s &s;trictly and lit|erally &s;peaking has not been granted them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 335, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</Q>
<Q>This kind of &s;inners being ab&s;olutely excluded from the privilege of forgivene&s;s, mu&s;t, as has been &s;aid, &s;uffer the torments of another world, before they can be &s;av|ed<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 340</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>IN the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages concerning the bla&s;phemers of the HOLY GHOST, the author plainly &s;uppo&s;es, that not only tho&s;e of that character, but all who &s;uffer the torments of hell are finally &s;aved without forgivene&s;s, ha|ving &s;atisfied by their own &s;ufferings the utmo&s;t demands of &s;trict ju&s;tice. He who is delivered from further pun|i&s;hment in con&s;equence of having &s;uffered a puni&s;hment however great in degree and long in duration, but not equal to that, to which he is liable by &s;trict ju&s;tice, is the &s;ubject of forgivene&s;s. Ju&s;t &s;o much puni&s;hment is for|given him, as is lacking to make the puni&s;hment, which
<PB N="3" REF="022478_0008_0FB9354EB448BC30">
he hath &s;uffered, equal to that, to which he is liable by &s;trict ju&s;tice. Now our author, in the pa&s;&s;ages ju&s;t quot|ed, &s;uppo&s;es that both the bla&s;phemers of the Holy Gho&s;t and all others who pa&s;s through the torments of hell, are finally delivered, not in con&s;equence of a puni&s;hment inferior in de|gree or duration, to that which may be inflicted on them, according to &s;trict ju&s;tice; as in that ca&s;e they would be the &s;ubjects of forgivene&s;s: but in con&s;equence of that pun|i&s;hment, which is according to &s;trict ju&s;tice, and therefore they are delivered without forgivene&s;s. He &s;ays, "The pardonablene&s;s of all other &s;ins, lies in the po&s;&s;ibility, that tho&s;e who have been guilty of them, &s;hould e&s;cape the tor|ments of hell." Tho&s;e therefore who actually pa&s;s through the torments of hell receive no forgivene&s;s; but are liber|ated on the footing of &s;trict ju&s;tice. If pardonablene&s;s, or which is the &s;ame, a po&s;&s;ibility of pardon con&s;i&s;t in a po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping the torments of hell; then actual par|don con&s;i&s;ts in an actual e&s;cape from tho&s;e torments. Of cour&s;e they who do not e&s;cape them, but pa&s;s through them, receive no pardon.</P>
<P>AGAIN: the only ob&s;ervation made by Dr. C. to &s;how, that the bla&s;phemers of the Holy Gho&s;t are not forgiven; or the only re&s;pect in which he a&s;&s;erts, that they are not forgiven, is, that they pa&s;s through the torments of hell. But as this holds good with regard to all the damned, it equally proves, that none of them are forgiven; and that the divine law takes its cour&s;e on them all; and that no intervening pardon will ever prevent the full execution of the threatened penalty on them.&mdash; Now if the divine law take its cour&s;e on the damned, and the penalty threatened in the law, be fully executed on them; they are undoubtedly puni&s;hed according to their demerits, or according to &s;trict ju&s;tice; and if after all, they be liberated from puni&s;hment, they are liberated not in the way of forgivene&s;s, nor on the footing of grace or favour; but on the footing of &s;trict ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But if this conclu&s;ion concerning all the damned be de|nied; yet as the bla&s;phemers of the Holy Gho&s;t are &s;ome of mankind, <HI>&s;ome</HI> of mankind at lea&s;t, if not all the dam+ned, will be &s;aved on the footing of &s;trict ju&s;tice, and without forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervations for &s;ub&s;tance, may be made on the other quotations above. If the damned &s;uffer
<Q>a mi|&s;ery
<PB N="4" REF="022478_0009_0FB93550332B3A58">
in proportion to the number and greatne&s;s of their vices;</Q>
if "they receive the wages of &s;in;" if they be
<Q>tormented variou&s;ly as to time, in proportion to their de&s;erts;</Q>
and
<Q>according to the difference there has been in the nature and number of their evil deeds</Q>;
if they &s;uffer
<Q>po&s;itive torments awfully great in degree and long in continuance, in proportion to the number and greatne&s;s of their crimes</Q>;
they are puni&s;hed to the utmo&s;t extent of ju&s;tice. To puni&s;h them any further would be exce&s;&s;ive, injurious and oppre&s;&s;ive. To exempt them from puni&s;hment, is &s;o far from an act of grace or favour, that it is an act called for by the mo&s;t rigorous ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e quotations, and by the ob&s;ervations on them, it appears, that our author holds, that the dam|ned &s;uffer a puni&s;hment properly and &s;trictly vindictive, and vindictive to the highe&s;t degree, and to the utmo&s;t extent to which vengeance in any ju&s;t government can pro|ceed. Indeed &s;peaking of the de&s;truction of Sodom and Gomorrah, he plainly a&s;&s;erts a vindictive puni&s;hment both of tho&s;e cities, and of the damned; he &s;ays,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 274.</NOTE> that "the de&s;truction of tho&s;e cities" was, "for a public example of the divine vengeance to after ages. And the fire of hell is doubtle&s;s called everla&s;ting for the like rea&s;on;" i. e. be|cau&s;e it will la&s;t, till it &s;hall have accompli&s;hed the de&s;ign of heaven in the de&s;truction of the damned, for a public example of the divine vengeance. In his <HI>Five Di&s;&s;ertations</HI> p. 110, he &s;peaks of the labour, &s;orrow and death which men &s;uffer in this world, as
<Q>te&s;timonies of GOD's <HI>vengeance,</HI> &mdash;as <HI>judgments</HI> on his part, and <HI>real evils</HI> on theirs;</Q>
By vindictive puni&s;hment is meant, that which is &s;ufficient to &s;upport and vindicate the authority of the divine law, or which is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of GOD. But no advo|cate for vindictive puni&s;hment ever &s;uppo&s;ed, that to vindi|cate the authority of the law and to &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of God, a greater puni&s;hment is nece&s;&s;ary, than is according to ju|&s;tice or according to the de&s;ert, or the nature and number of the &s;ins, the vices, the crimes of the per&s;on puni&s;hed: or that to tho&s;e ends, a greater puni&s;hment is nece&s;&s;ary, than is inflicted, when "the divine law takes its cour&s;e;" or than is implied "in the full execution of the threatened pe|nalty." A puni&s;hment greater than that which an&s;wers
<PB N="5" REF="022478_0010_0FB93553246AA990">
tho&s;e de&s;criptions, would be &s;o far from &s;atisfying ju&s;tice, that it would be po&s;itively <HI>unju&s;t</HI>: it would be &s;o far from &s;upporting the authority of the divine law, that it would bring it into contempt by violating it. If that po&s;itive torment, which in degree and continuance is ac|cording to the de&s;ert and the nature and number of the evil deeds of the &s;inner, be not &s;ufficient to &s;a|tisfy the ju&s;tice of GOD, I wi&s;h to be informed what would &s;atisfy it. &mdash; But Dr. C. him&s;elf holds, that the puni&s;hment which &s;atisfies the ju&s;tice of GOD, is vindictive and oppo&s;ed to that which is di&s;ciplinary and medicinal;
<Q>If the next &s;tate is a &s;tate of puni&s;hment not intended for the cure of the patients them&s;elves, but to &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of GOD, and give warn|ing to others; it is impo&s;&s;ible all men &s;hould be final|ly &s;aved <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>.</Q>
So that I am perfectly agreed with Dr. C. in his idea of a vindictive puni&s;hment, and whether he do not hold &s;uch puni&s;hment in the utmo&s;t extent, I appeal to every candid reader, who &s;hall have peru&s;ed the forecited quotations, or the pages from which they are taken.</P>
<P>YET Dr. C. is a great enemy to vindictive puni&s;hment, and it is a fundamental principle of his book, that the fu|ture puni&s;hment of the wicked is <HI>di&s;ciplinary</HI> and intended for the good, the repentance and reformation of the pa|tients, and not to &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of God. This appears from the quotation ju&s;t now made from page 11th; and by innumerable other pa&s;&s;ages, &s;ome of which I &s;hall now re|cite.
<Q>The wicked &s;hall be &s;ent to a place of weeping, and wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth; not to continue there al|ways, but till the rebellion of their hearts is &s;ubdued, and they are wrought upon to become the willing and obedient &s;ubjects of God</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 220.</NOTE>. "For ages of ages, the wicked &s;hall be mi&s;erable&mdash;as a mean to de&s;troy the enmity of their hearts and make them GOD's willing and obedient people<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 221.</NOTE>."
<Q>The re&s;t "[the wicked]" &s;hall have their portion in the place of blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s, as a &s;uitable and nece&s;&s;a|ry di&s;cipline, in order to their being reduced under mo|ral &s;ubjection to CHRIST<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 221. P.</NOTE>.</Q>
<Q>The other "[the wick|ed]" &s;hall be bani&s;hed to dwell in un&s;peakable torment, till they repent of their folly, and yield them&s;elves up to GOD, as his obedient &s;ervants<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">224.</NOTE>.</Q>

<P>AS this is his idea of the nature and end of the future pun|i&s;hment of the wicked, he often rejects with abhorrence the idea, that they are to be puni&s;hed for any other end exclu&s;ive of their own per&s;onal good. What he &s;ays in p. 325, implies, that unle&s;s we believe, that the future puni&s;hment of the wicked is intended for their per&s;onal good, we mu&s;t believe, that
<Q>the cha|racter of GOD, as the Father of mercies, and the God of pity, is limited to this world only;</Q>
and that he is not the
<Q>&s;ame good being in the other world, that he is in this;</Q>
&mdash;That on that &s;uppo&s;ition,
<Q>we &s;hall &s;ay that of our father in heaven, which we cannot &s;up|po&s;e of any father on earth, till we have fir&s;t dive&s;ted him of the heart of a father<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 327.</NOTE>.</Q>
And in page 11th, before quoted, he ab&s;olutely rejects all puni&s;hment which is not di&s;ciplinary.</P>
<P>BUT how the&s;e two fundamental parts of Dr. C's &s;y&s;|tem can be con&s;i&s;tent with each other, is difficult to be conceived. Is that puni&s;hment which is according to the de&s;erts of the &s;inner; that which in degree and continu|ance is according to the nature and number of his evil deeds; in which the divine law takes its cour&s;e upon him, and in which the penalty threatened in the law is fully ex|ecuted:
<PB N="7" REF="022478_0012_0FB93557B14ACE10">
is this puni&s;hment no more than a &s;uitable and nece&s;&s;ary di&s;cipline to the &s;inner; nece&s;&s;ary "to reduce him to a moral &s;ubjection to CHRIST;" nece&s;&s;ary
<Q>to his per|&s;onal good,</Q>
"his benefit," &amp;c? If &s;o, then that puni&s;h|ment which is according to &s;trict ju&s;tice and
<Q>&s;atisfies the ju&s;tice of GOD,</Q>
and that which is a mere merciful and beneficial di&s;cipline, are one and the &s;ame. The damned &s;inner &s;uffers no more puni&s;hment, than is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for his good, nor can without injury and oppre&s;&s;i|on be made to &s;uffer more: and all ground of di&s;tinction between vindictive and di&s;ciplinary puni&s;hment entirely vani&s;hes. But if any man &s;hould avow this &s;entiment, that &s;uch puni&s;hment only, as is nece&s;&s;ary and conducive to the &s;inner's per&s;onal good, can con&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice be inflicted; I beg leave to refer him to the next chap|ter, in which the &s;ubject is con&s;idered at large.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that Dr. C. could not con&s;i&s;tently adopt the &s;entiment ju&s;t men|tioned; becau&s;e he in page 11th before quoted, di&s;tin|gui&s;hes expre&s;ly between that puni&s;hment, which is in|tended for the cure of the patients, and that which is in|tended to &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of GOD; and a&s;&s;erts that the latter is incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;alvation of all men. His words are,
<Q>If the next &s;tate is a &s;tate of puni&s;hment, not intended for the cure of the patients them&s;elves, but to &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of GOD&mdash;'tis impo&s;&s;ible all men &s;hould be finally &s;aved.</Q>
On this notable pa&s;&s;age, I ob&s;erve, 1. That Dr. C. here, as every where el&s;e through his book, di&s;tingui&s;hes between a vindictive and di&s;ciplina|ry puni&s;hment; or between that puni&s;hment which is con|ducive to the &s;inner's good, and that which &s;atisfies divine ju&s;tice. It cannot therefore be &s;aid, that according to Dr. C. a puni&s;hment conducive to the &s;inner's good, is all that can in &s;trict ju&s;tice be inflicted on him.&mdash;2. He a&s;&s;erts, that if future puni&s;hment be intended to &s;atisfy divine ju&s;t|ice, it is impo&s;&s;ible all men &s;hould be &s;aved. Yet he him&s;elf in holding, that the wicked will be puni&s;hed ac|cording to their de&s;erts, and in degree and continuance ac|cording to the nature and number of their &s;ins, crimes and evil deeds; and that the divine law will take its cour&s;e on them, the whole threatened penalty be inflicted, and they never be forgiven; holds that puni&s;hment, which entirely &s;atisfies the ju&s;tice of GOD. Therefore, as he
<PB N="8" REF="022478_0013_0FB9355ECAC20B28">
al&s;o holds that &s;uch future puni&s;hment as &s;atisfies the ju&s;tice of GOD, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;alvation of all men; to be con&s;i&s;tent, he mu&s;t give up the doctrine of the &s;alva|tion of all men, to prove which, he wrote his whole book.</P>
<P>ANOTHER fundamental principle of Dr. C's book, is, that all men, both tho&s;e who are &s;aved immediately from this life, and tho&s;e who are &s;aved after they have &s;uffered the pains of hell; are &s;aved by the mere <HI>mercy, compa&s;&s;ion, grace</HI> or <HI>favour</HI> of GOD, <HI>through</HI> CHRIST.&mdash;He allows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page <HI>43.</HI></NOTE>, that the Apo&s;tle's Doctrine of ju&s;tification &s;tands

&mdash;
<Q>The gift by CHRIST takes ri&s;e from the many offences, which mankind commit in their own per&s;ons, and fin|ally terminates in oppo&s;ition to the power and demerit of them all, in their being re&s;tored, not &s;imply to life, but to reign in it forever<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 56.</NOTE>.</Q>

<P>NOW, how can this part of Dr. C's &s;y&s;tem be recon|ciled with that part, in which he holds, that all the damned will be puni&s;hed <HI>according to their de&s;erts?</HI> Can tho&s;e who are puni&s;hed <HI>according to their de&s;erts,</HI> after that be &s;aved <HI>on the foot of grace through</HI> CHRIST? Can tho&s;e who are puni&s;hed according to the nature and number of their evil deeds; in degree and continuance, in proportion to the number and greatne&s;s of their crimes; in who&s;e puni&s;h|ment the divine law takes its cour&s;e, and the threatened penalty is fully executed: can the&s;e per&s;ons be &s;aved by <HI>a gift?</HI> by a gift taken <HI>in the abounding &s;en&s;e? by the free gift of</HI> GOD <HI>through Chri&s;t</HI>? by <HI>rich mercy?</HI> by <HI>pity, tender compa&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>grace?</HI> by <HI>mercy exten&s;ively benevolent?</HI> by a <HI>wonderful</HI> de|&s;ign of <HI>mercy?</HI> by <HI>boundle&s;s</HI> and <HI>inexhau&s;tible goodne&s;s?</HI> by the <HI>utmo&s;t bowels of the divine compa&s;&s;ion?</HI> by the <HI>infinite indul|gence and love of their</HI> CREATOR? Is the man who by his crimes has, according to law, expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the pillory, or to be cropt and branded, and on whom the law has tak|en its cour&s;e, and the threatened penalty has been fully exe|cuted; is he after all delivered from further &s;uffering by <HI>grace,</HI> by <HI>pity,</HI> by <HI>tender compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> by <HI>indulgence and love,</HI> by the <HI>utmo&s;t bowels of compa&s;&s;ion?</HI>&mdash;No; he has a right on the foot of <HI>mere law,</HI> and of <HI>the mo&s;t rigorous ju&s;tice,</HI> to &s;ub&s;equent impunity, with re&s;pect to the crime or crimes, for which he has been thus puni&s;hed: and to tell him after

he is thus puni&s;hed, that he is now relea&s;ed by grace, by pity, by utmo&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, by indulgence and love, would be the gro&s;&s;e&s;t in&s;ult.</P>
<P>AGAIN; how can tho&s;e who have been puni&s;hed accor|ding to their de&s;erts, be &s;aved <HI>through</HI> CHRIST, or <HI>on his account?</HI> How can the obedience and death of CHRIST be the <HI>ground</HI> or <HI>rea&s;on</HI> of their &s;alvation? Having &s;uffered the full penalty threatened in the law, they have a right to demand future impunity, on account of their own &s;uffer|ings. What need then have they of CHRIST, of his obe|dience and death, or of his mediatory intervention, to be brought into the account? Dr. C. &s;peaks of the "de|liverance" or "the redemption which CHRIST has pur|cha&s;ed" for all men<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 153, 154.</NOTE>. But what need is there, that CHRIST &s;hould purcha&s;e deliverance for tho&s;e, who pur|cha&s;e it for them&s;elves, by their own per&s;onal &s;ufferings? Nay, what ju&s;tice would there be in refu&s;ing deliverance to a man, unle&s;s it be purcha&s;ed for him by another, when he hath fully purcha&s;ed it for him&s;elf? What if the per|&s;on before de&s;cribed to have &s;uffered &s;ome corporal pun|i&s;hment according to the &s;trictne&s;s of law, &s;hould be told at his relea&s;e, that he is delivered from further pun|i&s;hment, not on account of his own &s;ufferings; but <HI>on ac|count</HI> of &s;ome other per&s;on? <HI>on the ground,</HI> and <HI>for the rea&s;on</HI> of the obedience or merit of that other per&s;on? Might he not with ju&s;t indignation reply; Wherein hath that other per&s;on afforded me any relief? I have &s;uff|ered all that could be inflicted on me con&s;i&s;tently with law and ju&s;tice; and let the merit of that other per&s;on be what it may, I thank him for nothing: his merit hath benefited me nothing. As little benefit from CHRIST does he derive towards his deliverance, who &s;uffers ac|cording to his de&s;erts; and with as little propriety can it be &s;aid, that he is redeemed or delivered <HI>through</HI> CHRIST or <HI>on his account.</HI></P>
<P>ON the whole, Dr. C's &s;cheme comes to this; That not bare goodne&s;s, but that goodne&s;s, which is boundle&s;s and inexhau&s;tible; not bare compa&s;&s;ion but the utmo&s;t bowels of the divine compa&s;&s;ion; not bare indulgence and love, but the infinite indulgence and love of our cre|ator; will grant to his creatures of mankind, ju&s;t &s;o much relief from mi&s;ery, as they are entitled to by the mo&s;t rigorous ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="022478_0016_0FB9356485FF9948">NOR did Dr. C. fall into the&s;e incon&s;i&s;tences, by mere inattention; he was driven to them by dire nece&s;&s;ity, pro|vided it was nece&s;&s;ary for him, to adopt his favorite doc|trine of the &s;alvation of all men. Every one of the fore|mentioned principles is e&s;&s;ential to his &s;y&s;tem, and can by no means be &s;pared.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT the damned are puni&s;hed according to their de&s;erts, is manife&s;tly e&s;&s;ential to his &s;y&s;tem. For if in ages of ages they do not &s;uffer a puni&s;hment which is ac|cording to their de&s;erts, they do not &s;uffer that which might ju&s;tly be inflicted upon them; or, which is the &s;ame thing, that puni&s;hment which is denounced in the di|vine law: and according both to ju&s;tice and the divine law, the damned might be made to &s;uffer a greater puni&s;hment, than that which is for ages of ages; or than the longe&s;t puni&s;hment, which any of them will in fact &s;uffer. But as no body pretends there is any greater puni&s;hment threat|ened in the law, or in any part of &s;cripture, than that which in &s;criptural language is &s;aid to be for ever and ever, which D. C. &s;uppo&s;es to be for ages of ages only, and to be actually &s;uffered by &s;ome men at lea&s;t; he was nece&s;&s;itated to hold, that &s;ome &s;uffer the utmo&s;t puni&s;hment threaten|ed in the law, and of cour&s;e the utmo&s;t which they de&s;erve.</P>
<P>BESIDE; if he had allowed, that the damned do not &s;uffer &s;o long a puni&s;hment, as they de&s;erve, or as is threat|ened in the law; he might have been a&s;ked, how much longer that puni&s;hment is, which is threatened in the law, than that which they actually &s;uffer. And the an&s;wer mu&s;t have been, either that it is a longer temporary puni&s;hment; or that it is an endle&s;s puni&s;hment. But which ever an&s;wer &s;hould have been given, inexplicable difficulties would have followed. If he &s;hould have an|&s;wered, that the puni&s;hment threatened in the law, and which the &s;inner ju&s;tly de&s;erves, is a longer tem|porary puni&s;hment, than that which the damned actually &s;uffer, he might have been challenged, to point it out, as contained in the law, or in any part of &s;cripture: and it is pre&s;umed, that he would not have been able to do it.</P>
<P>BUT if he &s;hould have an&s;wered, that the puni&s;h|ment threatened in the law, and which the &s;inner ju&s;tly de&s;erves, is an <HI>endle&s;s</HI> puni&s;hment, he mu&s;t at once have given up all arguments in favour of univer&s;al &s;alvation,
<PB REF="022478_0017_0FB93566024062B0">
and again&s;t endle&s;s puni&s;hment, drawn from the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> of GOD. Surely the ju&s;tice of GOD does not oppo&s;e that which is ju&s;t, and which the &s;inner de&s;erves; or that which the ju&s;t law of GOD threatens. He mu&s;t al&s;o have acknowledged the infinite evil of &s;in, which &s;eems to have been a mo&s;t grievous eye-&s;ore to him. For no|thing more is meant by the infinite evil of &s;in, than that on the account of &s;in, the &s;inner de&s;erves an endle&s;s puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Again; Dr. C. could not a&s;&s;ert, that the damned do not &s;uffer all the puni&s;hment, which they de&s;erve, without contradicting apparently at lea&s;t, many clear and po&s;i|tive declarations of &s;cripture: &s;uch as, That GOD will render to every man according to his deeds, and ac|cording as his work &s;hall be; That every one &s;hall receive according to the things done in the body; That the wicked &s;hall not come out of the place of puni&s;h|ment, till they &s;hall have paid the uttermo&s;t farthing, and the very la&s;t mite; That he &s;hall have judgment with|out mercy, that &s;hewed no mercy, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT was equally nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould hold that the puni&s;hment of the damned is a di&s;cipline, nece&s;&s;ary and happily conducive to lead them to repentance, and to promote their good.&mdash;Otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t have holden, that future puni&s;hment is vindictive and intended to &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of GOD; which kind of pu|ni&s;hment is, according to his own account, incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;alvation of all men<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 11.</NOTE>. And otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t have given up all his arguments from the divine goodne&s;s, mercy, compa&s;&s;ion and grace, which are the chief argu|ments, on which he him&s;elf depended mo&s;t, for the &s;upport of his cau&s;e, and which are the mo&s;t popular, and the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive to the majority of his readers. Otherwi&s;e too, he could not have pretended, that his &s;cheme of uni|ver&s;al &s;alvation is a &s;cheme of &s;uch benevolence, of &s;uch boundle&s;s and inexhau&s;tible goodne&s;s, of &s;uch tender com|pa&s;&s;ion and grace, of &s;uch infinite indulgence and love: and mu&s;t have given up all the principal texts of &s;crip|ture, from which he argues univer&s;al &s;alvation; as they are incon&s;i&s;tent with the idea, that the damned will be finally admitted to happine&s;s, having previou&s;ly &s;uffered
<PB N="13" REF="022478_0018_0FB93568AD5AE2B8">
the whole puni&s;hment, which they de&s;erve.</P>
<P N="3">3. NOR could he make out his &s;cheme of univer&s;al &s;alvation, unle&s;s he held, that all men are &s;aved in the way of mere grace and favour through CHRIST. If he had not holden this, what I ob&s;erved under the la&s;t article, would be ob&s;ervable under this too, that he mu&s;t have given up all arguments drawn from the divine goodne&s;s; and al&s;o all arguments drawn from what the &s;criptures &s;ay of the extent of CHRIST's redemption&punc; particularly tho&s;e texts from which D. C. chiefly ar|gues in &s;upport of his &s;cheme. Every one of tho&s;e texts holds forth that all who are &s;aved, are &s;aved <HI>by grace, through</HI> CHRIST. He mu&s;t al&s;o have given up all argu|ments from &s;cripture. The &s;cripture knows of no &s;al|vation, but that which is founded on the mere favour of GOD forgiving the &s;ins of men, according to the riches of his grace, and ju&s;tifying them freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>Thus Dr. C. was compelled by nece&s;&s;ity to a&s;&s;ociate in his &s;cheme, principles which will wage eternal war with each other.</P>

Indeed he never gives the lea&s;t hint implying, that he imagined, that the introduction of the &s;inner to the po&s;itive happine&s;s of heaven is more an act of grace, than his <HI>deliverance from the pains of hell</HI>: but all that he &s;ays on the &s;ubject, implies the contrary.

<P>AS Dr. C. allows, that the deliverance of &s;inners from the pains of hell, in all in&s;tances, is as really an act of grace, and as really through CHRIST, as their admi&s;&s;ion to the joys of heaven; &s;o the &s;criptures are very clear as to the &s;ame matter. Gal. III. 13.
<Q>CHRIST hath redeemed us <HI>from the cur&s;e of the law,</HI> being made a cur&s;e for us.</Q>
Rom. V. 9.
<Q>We &s;hall be &s;aved <HI>from wrath</HI> through him.</Q>
1 The&s;. I. 10.
<Q>JESUS which <HI>delivered us from the wrath to come.</HI></Q>
And par|don or forgivene&s;s, which is a di&s;charge from de&s;erved puni&s;hment, is, in its very nature, an act of grace, and is, in &s;cripture, always &s;poken of as &s;uch, and as di&s;pen&s;ed through CHRIST only. Nor is any thing more clear from the &s;criptures, than that every per&s;on, who is &s;aved, is &s;aved in the way of <HI>forgivene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THERE would be no propriety in &s;aying, that a per&s;on who has &s;uffered all the puni&s;hment which he ju&s;tly de&s;erves, who is on the footing of law and ju&s;tice relea&s;ed from all further puni&s;hment, and is placed in a &s;tate of medi|ocrity,

<P N="2">II. PERHAPS it may be objected to part of the pre|ceding &s;ection, that by puni&s;hment
<Q>in proportion to their de&s;erts,</Q>
and "according to their evil deeds," &amp;c. Dr. C. meant not a puni&s;hment <HI>equal</HI> to &s;trict ju&s;tice, or <HI>&s;atisfactory</HI> to the ju&s;tice of GOD; but one in which a due pro|portion to the de&s;erts of the various per&s;ons, with re&s;pect to one another, who are the &s;ubjects of the puni&s;hment, is ob|&s;erved.&mdash;But to this it may be an&s;wered, Dr. C. doubtle&s;s meant to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ions,
<Q>in proportion to their de|&s;erts,</Q>
"according to their evil deeds," &amp;c. in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in which the &s;criptures &s;ay,
<Q>according to their works;</Q>
"according to the fruit of their doings," &amp;c. This is manife&s;t not only by the &s;imilarity of the expre&s;|&s;ions, but by his own reference to tho&s;e phra&s;es in &s;crip|ture, as in the following pa&s;&s;ages,
<Q>Which is plainly in|con&s;i&s;tent with that difference <HI>the &s;cripture</HI> often <HI>declares</HI> there &s;hall be, in the puni&s;hment of wicked men, ac|cording to the difference there has been in the nature and number of their evil deeds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 320.</NOTE>.</Q>

Here he undoubtedly refers to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in which the &s;criptures a&s;&s;ure us, that the judge
<Q>will render to every man according to his deeds;</Q>
"according as his work &s;hall be," &amp;c. Now the&s;e phra&s;es of &s;cripture are clearly explained to us, by tho&s;e repre&s;entations, in which the puni&s;hment of the wicked is illu&s;trated by the impri&s;onment of a debtor, till he &s;hall have paid the uttermo&s;t farthing, the very la&s;t mite, &amp;c. and by the pa&s;&s;ages, in which it is declared, that the wicked &s;hall have <HI>judgment without mercy</HI>; that GOD will <HI>not pity, nor &s;pare</HI> them &amp;c. Whereas, if they &s;uffer le&s;s than they de&s;erve according to &s;trict ju&s;tice; &s;o far they are the objects of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>pity</HI>; &s;o far GOD does <HI>&s;pare</HI> them; &s;o far they have <HI>mercy mixed with judgment.</HI> Nor can it be &s;aid, that they pay the <HI>uttermo&s;t farthing</HI> of the debt.</P>
<P>AGAIN; Dr. C. allows, that the wicked will in the &s;econd death receive the wages of &s;in. But the wages of a man are not merely a part, or a certain proportion of what he de&s;erves, or has earned, but the whole. No
<PB N="17" REF="022478_0022_0FB9356FC01FD470">

<P N="3">III. IT may al&s;o be objected to a part of the former &s;ection, that though "the law &s;hall have its cour&s;e" on &s;ome men, and "the full penalty threatened in the law, be ex|ecuted on them;" &s;till this does not imply a puni&s;hment equal or &s;atisfactory to &s;trict ju&s;tice; as the divine law it&s;elf does not, nor ever did threaten all that puni&s;hment, which is de&s;erved according to &s;trict ju&s;tice: and therefore though the damned &s;hall &s;uffer all which is threatened in the law, yet they will not &s;uffer a vindictive puni&s;hment, a puni&s;hment which &s;hall "&s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of GOD."&mdash;Con|cerning this objection it may be ob&s;erved;</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT by <HI>the law</HI> is meant, to u&s;e Dr. C's own words, "the moral law,"
<Q>the law of nature, the law of <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> which is the law of GOD:</Q>
and to &s;ay, that this law does not threaten a penalty adequate to the de|mands of ju&s;tice, is to &s;ay, that it does not threaten a pen|alty adequate to the demands of rea&s;on. If &s;o, it is not the law of rea&s;on; which is contrary to the &s;uppo&s;ition. Therefore to &s;ay, that the law of rea&s;on does not threaten a penalty adequate to the demands of ju&s;tice, is a real con|tradiction.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT Dr. C. neither does nor could con&s;i&s;tently make this objection; becau&s;e if the objection were ju&s;t, men might be ju&s;tified, "on a claim founded on <HI>mere law.</HI>" On the principle of the objection, the law threatens a pun|i&s;hment far le&s;s than we de&s;erve; and a man having &s;uf|fered this puni&s;hment, may be ju&s;tified on the foundation of mere law: the law would be &s;atisfied, and the man would &s;tand right with re&s;pect to it, nor would it have any further claim on him, in the way of puni&s;hment, more than on a per&s;on who had never tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. Therefore he thenceforward obeying the law, might as truly be ju&s;ti|fied on the foot of <HI>mere law,</HI> as if he had rendered the &s;ame obedience, without ever tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>BUT Dr. C. holds,
<Q>that mankind univer&s;ally have &s;inned, and con&s;equently cannot be ju&s;tified upon a claim founded on <HI>mere law</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 43.</NOTE>.</Q>
And <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 34.</NOTE> that
<Q>the whole world had become guilty before God, and were there|fore incapable of being ju&s;tified upon the foot of mere

law.</Q>
That all men are <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 36.</NOTE>
<Q>incapable of ju&s;tification up|on the foot of mere law, as having become guilty before GOD.</Q>
To the &s;ame effect in various other pa&s;&s;ages. So that according to Dr. C. if future puni&s;hment be in|tended to &s;atisfy <HI>the law,</HI> it is equally impo&s;&s;ible, that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, as it is on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that fu|ture puni&s;hment is intended to &s;atisfy <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Dr. C. ALLOWS, that a man having &s;uffered the penalty of the law, is not, and cannot be, the object of for|givene&s;s.
<Q><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 336.</NOTE> If they are not &s;aved, till after they have pa&s;&s;ed through the&s;e torments, they have never been forgiven&mdash;The divine law has taken its cour&s;e; nor has any intervening pardon prevented the full execu|tion of the threatened penalty on them. Forgivene&s;s &s;trictly and literally &s;peaking, has not been granted to them.</Q>
But if tho&s;e who &s;uffer the penalty of the law, are not, in their &s;ub&s;equent exemption from puni&s;hment, the objects of forgivene&s;s, they &s;uffer all they <HI>de&s;erve.</HI> So far as they are exempted from <HI>de&s;erved</HI> puni&s;hment, they are forgiven: forgivene&s;s means nothing el&s;e than an ex|emption from de&s;erved puni&s;hment.</P>
<P N="4">4. Dr. C. &s;ays, that Adam (and for the &s;ame rea&s;on doubtle&s;s men in general)
<Q>mu&s;t have rendered him&s;elf obnoxious to the <HI>righteous re&s;entment</HI> of his GOD and KING, had he expre&s;&s;ed a di&s;regard to any command<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>5</HI> Di&s;&s;ertations P. <HI>55.</HI></NOTE></Q>
of the moral law, the law of which the Doctor is &s;peaking in that pa&s;&s;age. But the righteous re&s;entment of GOD for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is a ju&s;t puni&s;hment of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and a ju&s;t puni&s;hment is any puni&s;hment, which is not unju&s;t. And it is impo&s;&s;ible that Adam &s;hould be obnoxious to &s;uch a puni&s;hment, if the law, the mo&s;t &s;trict rule of GOD's proceedings with his creatures, had not threatened it.&mdash; Thus Dr. C. him&s;elf grants, that the puni&s;hment threat|ened in the law is the &s;ame which is de&s;erved according to &s;trict ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE Doctor every where holds, that "the law of GOD is a perfect rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Particularly <HI>12</HI> Sermons P. <HI>36.</HI></NOTE>." But if the law do not threaten all the puni&s;hment which is ju&s;tly de&s;erved by &s;in, it is no more truly a perfect rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s, than the go&s;pel is. &mdash;Again;
<Q>Is the law that rule of right, which GOD knows to be the mea&s;ure of men's duty to
<PB N="19" REF="022478_0024_0FB9357374A24DE0">
him, and of what is fit he &s;hould do for, or inflict upon them, as they are either obedient, or di&s;obedient? There is, without all doubt, &s;uch a rule of men's duty towards GOD, and of GOD's conduct towards men, in a way of reward or puni&s;hment, according to their works.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE></Q>
There could &s;carcely be a more explicit con|ce&s;&s;ion, that the divine law threatens all that puni&s;hment, which is acording to ju&s;tice. It is declared to be, not only the <HI>rule of right,</HI> but the <HI>mea&s;ure of what is fit in pu|ni&s;hment,</HI> as well as of duty. Indeed Dr. C. never once, &s;o far as I have noticed, &s;ugge&s;ts the idea, that the di|vine law does not threaten all that puni&s;hment, which is de&s;erved by &s;in.</P>
<P N="5">5. ACCORDING to this objection, the moral law is a di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, as truly as the go&s;pel. But how does this accord with the &s;cripture? That declares, that "the <HI>law</HI> was given by Mo&s;es, but <HI>grace</HI> and truth," or the gracious truth, "came by JESUS CHRIST;" Joh. I. 17. &mdash;"If they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promi&s;e made of none effect. Becau&s;e the law worketh <HI>wrath.</HI>&mdash;Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by <HI>grace</HI>;" Rom. IV. 14. &mdash; "The &s;ting of death is &s;in, and the &s;trength of &s;in is the law;" 1 Cor. XV. 56.&mdash;As in the objection now under con&s;ideration, the law is &s;uppo&s;ed to be as really a di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, as the go&s;pel; we may &s;ay, The &s;trength of &s;in is the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> as truly as, The &s;trength of &s;in is the <HI>law.</HI>&mdash;Be&s;ide; if the law be a di&s;pen&s;a|tion of grace, how can it be &s;aid to be the <HI>&s;trength</HI> of &s;in? It threatens a part only of the puni&s;hment de&s;erved by &s;in; and therefore it neither points out, how &s;trong &s;in is, to bring into condemnation, nor does it give to &s;in its proper force to terrify and torment the &s;inner, by exhibiting the whole puni&s;hment de&s;erved by &s;in. On the ground of this objection, the &s;trength of &s;in con|&s;i&s;ts in the rule of &s;trict ju&s;tice, not in the law.</P>
<P N="6">6. The apo&s;tle tells us, that "by the law is the know|ledge of &s;in." But the knowledge of the evil or de|merit of &s;in is obtained by the knowledge of the <HI>threatening</HI> of the law only. If the law do not threaten all that puni&s;hment, which &s;in de&s;erves, we know not by the law, what &s;in de&s;erves, or how evil it is.&mdash; And if we know not this by the law, neither do we

<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> by any <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> means whatever. Nor do we know our own demerit, nor our own proper characters as &s;inners; nor are we in any capacity to judge concerning our obligation to gratitude for the redemption of CHRIST, or for &s;alvation through him; nor have we the the proper motive to repentance &s;et before us, in all the &s;criptures. The proper mo|tive to repentance is the evil of &s;in.&mdash;And if we have not the knowledge of the evil of &s;in, it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould know the grace of pardon, or of &s;alvation from that puni&s;hment which is ju&s;tly de&s;erved by &s;in.</P>
<P N="7">7. The apo&s;tle declares, as we have &s;een, that "by the law is the knowledge of <HI>&s;in,</HI>" and that "the law worketh <HI>wrath.</HI>" But on the principle of this objection, by the law is the knowledge of <HI>grace,</HI> and the law worketh <HI>grace</HI>: and GOD without any atonement did grant to &s;inners &s;ome remi&s;&s;ion or mitigation of de&s;erv|ed puni&s;hment. Why then could not complete remi&s;&s;i|on or pardon have been granted in the &s;ame way? What need was there of CHRIST and his death? Yet Dr. C. holds, that it was with a view to the obedience and death of CHRIST, <HI>upon this account, upon this ground, for this rea&s;on,</HI> that GOD was plea&s;ed to make the go&s;pel pro|mi&s;e of a glorious immortality to the mi&s;erable &s;ons of men."</P>
<P N="8">8. IF the full puni&s;hment to which the &s;inner ju&s;tly expo&s;es him&s;elf by &s;in, be not pointed out in the law; it is not a good law, as it does not teach the &s;ub|ject of the law the truth in this matter; but it is a deceitful law, or is directly calculated to deceive. It threat|ens a puni&s;hment, which the &s;ubject would naturally believe to be the whole puni&s;hment to which he is expo&s;ed by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, or which can be ju&s;tly inflicted on him.&mdash;But this, if the objection be well grounded, is by no means the ca&s;e. Thus the law would naturally tend to deceive fatally all its &s;ubjects.</P>
<P N="9">9. From what is granted by Dr. C. it certainly fol|lows, that the threatening of the law is all that can be inflicted con&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice, and that the puni&s;h|ment threatened in the law, and that which is allowed by &s;trict ju&s;tice, is one and the &s;ame. He &s;ays, "Whatever &s;in may in its own nature, be &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;erve; it is not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that it &s;hould be univer&s;ally
<PB N="21" REF="022478_0026_0FB9357E932B16D8">
reckoned to death, when no law is in being that makes death the &s;pecial penalty of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion."*&mdash;"Sin is not reckoned, brought to account, <HI>ought</HI> not to be looked upon as being taxed with the forfeiture of life, when there is no law in being, with death as its a&s;|ffixed &s;anction."&Dagger; Therefore whatever &s;in may be &s;up|po&s;ed to de&s;erve, it is not <HI>rea&s;onable,</HI> that it &s;hould be reckoned, it <HI>ought not</HI> to be reckoned, or which is the &s;ame thing, it is <HI>not ju&s;t,</HI> that it &s;hould be reckoned to any puni&s;hment whatever, when there is no law in being, which makes that puni&s;hment the &s;pecial penalty of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Therefore, as I &s;aid, the puni&s;hment threatened in the law, is all which can be inflicted con|&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice; and the puni&s;hment threatened in the law, and that which is allowed by &s;trict ju&s;tice, are one and the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="10">10. If the law do not threaten all that puni&s;hment, which is ju&s;t, we cannot po&s;&s;ibly tell what is a ju&s;t pu|ni&s;hment, or what ju&s;tice threatens or admits with re|gard to puni&s;hment, and what it does not admit. If once we give up the law and the te&s;timony, we are left to our own imaginations. Dr. C. holds, that the wages of &s;in are the &s;econd death, and that this death is a puni&s;hment which &s;hall la&s;t, according to the language of &s;cripture, <HI>for ever and ever.</HI> Are the&s;e wages, and this puni&s;h|ment which &s;hall continue <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> adequate to the demand of ju&s;tice or not? If they are, then the law threatens all which ju&s;tice requires.&mdash;If they are not; then the wages of &s;in, and the puni&s;hment for ever and ever, are a <HI>gracious</HI> puni&s;hment, and &s;inners <HI>de&s;erve</HI> a longer puni&s;hment. But how do we know, that &s;inners de&s;erve a longer puni&s;hment, than this? No longer pu|ni&s;hment is threatened in the law, or in any part of &s;crip|ture.</P>
<P N="11">11. IF &s;in de&s;erve a longer puni&s;hment, than that which is threatened in the law, it de&s;erves either an end|le&s;s puni&s;hment, or a temporary puni&s;hment longer than that which is threatened in the law. But if &s;in de&s;erve an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, it is an <HI>infinite evil.</HI>&mdash;If it de&s;erve a temporary puni&s;hment though longer than that which is threatened in the law, all men may finally be &s;aved, even though the &s;tate of future puni&s;hment be intended to &s;a|tisfy the divine ju&s;tice: the contrary of which however is a&s;&s;erted by Dr. C.</P>

<P>I NOW appeal to the reader, whether, notwith&s;tand|ing this objection, the damned, in &s;uffering the whole penalty thretened in the divine law, do not &s;uffer as much as they de&s;erve according to &s;trict ju&s;tice, and therefore &s;uffer a penalty to the highe&s;t degree vindictive.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Whether the damned de&s;erve any other puni&s;hment, than that which is conducive to their per&s;onal good.</HEAD>
<P>ON the &s;uppo&s;ition, that future puni&s;hment is a mere di&s;cipline nece&s;&s;ary and happily conducive to the re|pentance and good of the damned; it may be a&s;ked, whether &s;uch di&s;cipline be all which they <HI>de&s;erve,</HI> and which can con&s;i&s;tently with &s;trict ju&s;tice be inflicted; or whether they do indeed de&s;erve a greater degree or du|ration of puni&s;hment, than that which is &s;ufficient to lead them to repentance, and that additional puni&s;hment be by grace remitted to them. Let us con&s;ider both the&s;e hy|pothe&s;es.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, that the wicked de&s;erve, according to &s;trict ju&s;tice, no more puni&s;hment, than is nece&s;&s;ary to lead them to repentance, and to prepare them for happine&s;s.&mdash; That this is not a mere hypothe&s;is made by an opponent of Dr. C. but is a doctrine <HI>implied</HI> at lea&s;t, if not expre&s;&s;|ly a&s;&s;erted in his book, may appear by the following quo|tations. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 321, 322.</NOTE> Is it not far more <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e, that

<Q>The con&s;ideration of hell as a purging fire, is that only which can make the matter &s;it ea&s;y on one's mind.</Q>
But if hell, though not merely a purging fire, be ju&s;tly de&s;erved, why does not the thought of it &s;it ea&s;y on one's mind? So that it is manife&s;tly implied in this rea&s;oning of Dr. C. that no other puni&s;hment of the wick|ed can be reconciled with ju&s;tice, than that which is adapted to their per&s;onal good.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame is implicitly a&s;&s;erted by other writers on the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion concerning future puni&s;hment. Bi&s;hop <HI>Newton,</HI> in his <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation on the final &s;tate of man|kind,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As tran&s;cribed in the Monthly Review for March <HI>1783.</HI></NOTE> &s;ays,
<Q>It is <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and wi&s;e and good, and even mer|ciful, to correct a &s;inner as long as he <HI>de&s;erves</HI> correct|ion; to whip and &s;courge him, as I may &s;ay, out of his faults.</Q>
Therefore all the puni&s;hment of the &s;inner, which is <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> and which he <HI>de&s;erves,</HI> is correction, or to be &s;courged out of his faults. The Chevalier <HI>Ram&s;ay</HI> tells us, that
<Q>Ju&s;tice is that perfection in GOD, by which he endevaours to make all intelligences ju&s;t<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Principles of Nat. &amp; Rev'd Religion, Vol. I. P. <HI>432.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
<Q>Vindictive ju&s;tice, is that attribute in GOD, by which he pur&s;ues vice with all &s;orts of torments, till it be totally extirpated, de&s;troyed and annihilated&Verbar;.</Q>
Therefore if GOD inflict any puni&s;hment with any other de&s;ign, than to make the &s;ubject of that puni&s;hment ju&s;t, and to extirpate vice from him, he violates even <HI>vindictive</HI> ju&s;tice. M. <HI>Pet|itpierre</HI> in a tract lately publi&s;hed in England, and highly applauded by &s;ome, declares, that
<Q>repentance appea&s;es divine anger, and di&s;arms its ju&s;tice; becau&s;e it ac|compli&s;hes the end infinite goodne&s;s has in view, even when arrayed in the awful maje&s;ty of avenging ju|&s;tice; which was &s;evere, becau&s;e the moral &s;tate of the &s;inner required &s;uch di&s;cipline; and which when that &s;tate is rever&s;ed, by conver&s;ion and holine&s;s, will have nothing to be&s;tow &s;uitable to it, but the delight|ful manife&s;tations of mercy and forgivene&s;s.</Q>**
<Q>The honour of the divine law is &s;ufficiently guard|ed by the puni&s;hment of the &s;inner as long as he re|mains impenitent, and by the faithful and obedient adherence of the penitent offender. Divine ju&s;tice is
<PB N="25" REF="022478_0030_0FB93587940D7410">
always &s;atisfied when it attains its end; and this end is always attained, whenever the &s;inner is brought to repentance.</Q>
<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 112.</NOTE> So that it is evident, that all the&s;e writers implicitly held the propo&s;ition now under con&s;i|deration, which is, that the wicked de&s;erve according to &s;trict ju&s;tice, no more puni&s;hment than is nece&s;&s;ary to lead them to repentance, and prepare them for happine&s;s. This is not only a real tenet of tho&s;e writers, but is mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and important to their &s;y&s;tem; for if the con|trary can be e&s;tabli&s;hed, con&s;equences will follow, which will greatly embarra&s;s, if not entirely overthrow that &s;y|&s;tem. I therefore beg the patience of the reader, while I particularly examine that tenet: Concerning it the fol|lowing ob&s;ervations may be made,</P>
<P N="1">1. IT implies that the puni&s;hment which is nece&s;&s;ary to lead the wicked to repentance is the cur&s;e of the divine law. Without doubt that puni&s;hment which amounts to the utmo&s;t, which &s;trict ju&s;tice admits, includes the pe|nalty or cur&s;e of the divine law. The latter does not exceed the former; becau&s;e the divine law is founded in perfect ju&s;tice, and whatever is incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, is equally incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine law. If therefore the &s;inner de&s;erve, according to &s;trict ju&s;tice, preci&s;ely &s;o much puni&s;hment as is nece&s;&s;ary to lead him to re|pentance and no more, then this is the true and utmo&s;t cur&s;e of the divine law.&mdash;Yet &s;uch a puni&s;hment as this, is really <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> whole no evil, and therefore no cur&s;e even to the &s;ubject; becau&s;e by the &s;uppo&s;ition it is nece&s;&s;ary to lead him to repentance, and prepare him for the everla&s;ting joys and glory of heaven.</P>
<P>Dr. C. has given us his idea of a <HI>cur&s;e,</HI> in his Five Di&s;&s;ertations,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 109 110.</NOTE> in the following words, "A te&s;timony of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t man's offence": "A te&s;timony of the <HI>vengeance</HI> of GOD, which is a <HI>judgment</HI> on his part and <HI>a real evil</HI> on man's part." In the &s;ame book,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 112.</NOTE> he &s;tates his idea of a ble&s;&s;ing to a man, to be, "That which is greatly to his advantage." But the pains of hell, if they be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and mo&s;t happily conducive to the repentance and endle&s;s happine&s;s of the damned, are no <HI>real evil</HI> on their part, nor any <HI>judgment</HI> or te&s;ti|mony of <HI>vengeance</HI> on GOD's part: and therefore are no cur&s;e at all; but are according to the Doctor's own definition
<PB N="26" REF="022478_0031_0FB9358891742B90">
a real <HI>ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> and a real te&s;timony of the <HI>benevolence</HI> of GOD to the damned. Surely a medicine of di&s;agreeable ta&s;te, but ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the life, or re|&s;tore the health of a man, and admini&s;tered with con&s;ummate judgment, is no evil or cur&s;e to the man to whom it is admini&s;tered; but is a de&s;irable good, or a ble&s;&s;ing to him; and the admini&s;tration of it, is a full proof of the benevo|lence of the phy&s;ician to his patient. A proof equally de|mon&s;trative of the divine benevolence to the damned, is the whole of their puni&s;hment in hell, if it be de&s;igned merely to lead them to repentance and to prepare them for happine&s;s: and this fruit of the divine benevolence can, according to Dr. C's own definition of a cur&s;e, be no cur&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is granted by Dr. C. and in general by other ad|vocates for univer&s;al &s;alvation, that the torments of hell are not only wi&s;ely adapted, but that they are ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to lead the damned to repentance; that no more gentle means would &s;o well an&s;wer the pro|po&s;ed end; that therefore the divine goodne&s;s and wi&s;|dom have cho&s;en and applied tho&s;e torments, as the means of good to the damned. But certainly that which is on the whole nece&s;&s;ary for a per&s;on's own good, is to him, on the whole, no real evil, and therefore no cur&s;e; but a good, a ble&s;&s;ing; a wi&s;e man would choo&s;e it for him&s;elf, as it is, in its connection, really and properly eligible or de&s;irable. If the torments of hell taken in connection with repentance and endle&s;s happine&s;s be a cur&s;e, then repentance and endle&s;s happine&s;s taken in connection with the torments of hell, are a cur&s;e too. If &s;ome bitter pill, con&s;idered as connected with life, be a cur&s;e; than life connected with that pill, is a cur&s;e too. That and that only is a cur&s;e to a per&s;on, which taken in its proper connections and dependences, renders him more mi&s;erable, than he would be without it. On the con|trary, that is a ble&s;&s;ing to a per&s;on, which taken in its proper connections and dependences, renders him more happy than he would be without it. It is ju&s;t as great a ble&s;&s;ing and ju&s;t as great a privilege, as happine&s;s it&s;elf. And with what propriety this can be called a <HI>cur&s;e,</HI> I appeal to every man acquainted with propriety of lan|guage to determine. To call this a cur&s;e is to confound
<PB N="27" REF="022478_0032_0FB9358A27060938">
a cur&s;e and a ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash;This being the true idea of a cur&s;e and a ble&s;&s;ing, it immediately follows on the &s;up|po&s;ition now under con&s;ideration, that the torments of hell are no cur&s;e, but a ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e on whom they are inflicted; becau&s;e the very &s;uppo&s;ition is, that they are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure and promote their happine&s;s and are inflicted for this end only.</P>
<P>THE ab&s;urdity then, to which on the whole we are reduced is, that tho&s;e means, which are the be&s;t that infinite wi&s;dom it&s;elf could devi&s;e and apply, for the &s;alvation of tho&s;e who die in impenitence, are the cur&s;e of the divine law; and that the greate&s;t evil which God can con&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice inflict on the greate&s;t and mo&s;t obdurate enemy of him&s;elf, of his Son our glo|rious Saviour, of his law, of his grace, and of mankind, is, to put him under the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible advantages to &s;e|cure and promote his highe&s;t everla&s;ting happine&s;s: Which is no more nor le&s;s than to &s;ay, That the great|e&s;t cur&s;e which God can con&s;i&s;tently with his perfections inflict on the &s;inner dying in impenitence, is to be&s;tow on him the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, which it is in the power of omnipotence and infinite bounty to be&s;tow on him, in his pre&s;ent temper of mind; that the divine law has no cur&s;e at all annexed to it; and that the penalty of the law is an ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing, the ble&s;&s;ing of repen|tance, or of that di&s;cipline, which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and mo&s;t wi&s;ely adapted to lead to repentance, and to prepare for the greate&s;t happine&s;s.</P>
<P>IF on this view of the matter, it &s;hould be &s;aid, that the puni&s;hment of hell is not the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing which God can be&s;tow on the &s;inner who dies in impenitence; that it would be a greater ble&s;&s;ing, to grant him repen|tance by immediate efficacious grace, and then receive him to heavenly happine&s;s;&mdash;Concerning this I ob&s;erve, that it gives up the only ground, on which the &s;uppo&s;i|tion now under con&s;ideration re&s;ts, and on which alone it can be &s;upported. The &s;uppo&s;ition is, that the puni&s;hment of hell is inflicted with the &s;ole view of leading the &s;uff|erers to repentance, and of promoting their good. But if their good might be as effectually &s;ecured and promot|ed by other means, as is now a&s;&s;erted, then the torments of hell are not inflicted to promote the good of the &s;ufferers.
<PB N="28" REF="022478_0033_0FB9358B73AB66D8">
So far as their good is concerned, tho&s;e torments are needle&s;s, nay they are a wanton exerci&s;e of cruelty. But as cruelty cannot be a&s;cribed to <HI>the only wi&s;e God,</HI> he mu&s;t, if this objection be valid, inflict the torments of hell, for &s;ome other end, than the final happine&s;s of tho&s;e who are &s;ent to that world of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>BESIDE; Dr. C. and other oppo&s;ers of endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment, are no friends to the doctrine of <HI>efficacious grace.</HI> According to their &s;y&s;tem, efficacious grace de&s;troys all liberty and moral agency, and reduces men to mere ma|chines. Therefore in their view, to be led to repentance by efficacious grace, is not a greater ble&s;&s;ing, than to be led to repentance by the torments of hell; becau&s;e it is not a greater ble&s;&s;ing to be a watch or a windmill than to be a rational moral agent. Nay, according to their &s;y&s;|tem, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of leading by efficacious grace any man to a repentence which is of a holy or of a moral nature: becau&s;e according to their &s;y&s;tem, a nece&s;&s;ary holine&s;s is no holine&s;s, and a nece&s;&s;ary repentance is no more of a moral nature, than the working of a machine.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF all who are &s;aved, be delivered from wrath on account of the merit of Chri&s;t in any &s;en&s;e, then that puni&s;hment, which leads to repentance, is not the cur&s;e of the law, or is not all the puni&s;hment which ju&s;tice admits. They who &s;uffer the cur&s;e of the law, &s;atisfy the law, and therefore &s;tand in no need of the merit of Chri&s;t to &s;atisfy the law or to deliver them from the cur&s;e of it. They can no longer con&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice be holden under that cur&s;e. To hold &s;uch per&s;ons &s;till under the cur&s;e of the law, unle&s;s they can obtain an intere&s;t in the merit of Chri&s;t, can never be reconciled with the moral perfection of God. Yet this is the very fact, if that puni&s;hment which leads to repentance be the cur&s;e of the law and at the &s;ame time, as Dr. C. abundantly holds, &s;alvation in the deliverance from wrath, as well as in the be&s;towment of po&s;itive happine&s;s, be granted to no man, but on account of the merit of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. ON this hypothe&s;is, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t will not &s;ave all men, nor will all men be &s;aved, whether by Chri&s;t, or without him.&mdash;Deliverance from the cur&s;e of the law is e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation. But if the cur&s;e of the law be that puni&s;hment, which is nece&s;&s;ary to lead to
<PB N="29" REF="022478_0034_0FB9358D004D4540">
repentance; and if, as the advocates for univer&s;al &s;alva|tion hold, a great part of mankind will &s;uffer this puni&s;h|ment; it follows, that a great part of mankind will not be &s;aved. For to be &s;aved, and yet to &s;uffer the cur&s;e of the law, is a direct contradiction. To &s;uffer the cur&s;e of the law is to be damned, and is all the damnation to which any &s;inner is expo&s;ed, and to which ju&s;tice, the mo&s;t &s;trict and rigorous ju&s;tice, can doom him. If then any man have &s;uffered this damnation, from what is he or can he be &s;aved? Certainly from nothing, becau&s;e he is expo&s;ed to nothing: unle&s;s we &s;ay, that by the <HI>ju&s;t</HI> law of the God of <HI>perfect ju&s;tice,</HI> he is expo&s;ed to <HI>unju&s;t</HI> pun|i&s;hment.</P>
<P>IF to this argument it be objected, that though all men are not &s;aved from the cur&s;e of the law, whether by Chri&s;t, or without him; yet all are finally admitted to happine&s;s; tho&s;e who repent in this life, are admitted to happine&s;s through the merits of Chri&s;t; tho&s;e who die impenitent, are admitted to the &s;ame, in con&s;equence of enduring in their own per&s;ons, the cur&s;e of the law: and that this is all which is intended by the &s;alvation of all men:&mdash;with re&s;pect to this I ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">(1) THIS is no proper <HI>&s;alvation,</HI> which in its primary meaning &s;ignifies a deliverance from evil. But accord|ing to the ca&s;e now &s;tated, &s;ome men are not deliv|ered from any evil, to which they ever were expo&s;ed; but &s;uffer it all. Therefore they are not &s;aved.</P>
<P N="2">(2) That this objection entirely &s;ets a&s;ide, with re|gard to a great part of mankind, &s;alvation in the way of forgivene&s;s of &s;in, and the free grace of God in the pardon of the &s;inner, which is contrary to the whole go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But to proceed; as Chri&s;t, on the pre&s;ent hypothe&s;is, doth not in fact &s;ave all men; &s;o it would be no favour to them, for him to attempt the &s;alvation of all tho&s;e who die impenitent. An attempt to deliver them from the cur&s;e of the law, would be an attempt to deprive them of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, wi&s;e, de&s;irable and merciful means of grace, on which their eternal happine&s;s de|pends: an attempt not to deliver them from any thing which on the whole is an evil, a di&s;advantage even to them&s;elves; but to deprive them of that on which their
<PB N="30" REF="022478_0035_0FB9359236986120">
&s;upreme intere&s;t depends; of that which is in fact the greate&s;t good, which they, in their pre&s;ent temper can enjoy, and the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing which at pre&s;ent God can po&s;&s;ibly be&s;tow on them.&mdash;Now to deprive them of this, is certainly no favour, nor any fruit of grace, mer|cy or goodne&s;s to them per&s;onally. Even to take them to heaven, before they have pa&s;&s;ed through this di&s;cip|line would by no means be &s;o great a favour to them, as to cau&s;e them to pa&s;s through this di&s;cipline; as it would be to take them to heaven before they were prepared for it, or could enjoy happine&s;s in it.</P>
<P>FURTHER; if the cur&s;e of the law be that puni&s;hment, which is nece&s;&s;ary to lead to repentance, then Chri&s;t came not to deliver from the cur&s;e of the law, all who are to be finally happy, but to inflict that cur&s;e on a part of them. Chri&s;t is exalted to be a prince and a Savi|our to give repentance and forgivene&s;s of &s;ins. It is a part of his office, to bring men to repentance, by all wi&s;e and proper means. Dr. C. and other advocates for univer&s;al &s;alvation, &s;uppo&s;e, that hell torments are the means, and mo&s;t wi&s;e, proper and nece&s;&s;ary means too, by which Chri&s;t will execute the work of giving re|pentance to all the damned. Therefore his work as a &s;aviour, &s;o far as re&s;pects <HI>them,</HI> is, on Dr. C's plan, not to deliver them from the cur&s;e of the law, but to in|flict that cur&s;e on them. But who is not &s;truck with the contrariety of this idea, to the con&s;tant, uniform declara|tions of &s;cripture, that Chri&s;t came to redeem us from the cur&s;e of the law, to &s;ave us from wrath, to deliver us from the wrath to come, &amp;c.</P>
<P>WILL it be &s;aid in oppo&s;ition to the la&s;t ob&s;ervation, that tho&s;e who die in impenitence, are not &s;aved in any &s;en&s;e by or through Chri&s;t, whether by his atonement, or by him as God's prime mini&s;ter, in the fulne&s;s of times bringing all to repentance; and that therefore Chri&s;t is not come to inflict the cur&s;e of the law on any who &s;hall be finally happy? Then let it never more be pleaded, that Chri&s;t is the &s;aviour of all men; that he gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all; that he ta&s;ted death for every man; that the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath abounded unto the many, (meaning all men) that by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one the

For if Chri&s;t &s;hall not finally have &s;aved all men by his merit, nor &s;hall have led them to repentance in the execution of the &s;cheme of providence; in what &s;en&s;e can the &s;alvation of all men be a&s;cribed to Chri&s;t? In what conceivable &s;en&s;e can he be called the Saviour of all men?&mdash;Therefore if any adopt the idea of the objection ju&s;t &s;tated, let them never more plead in favour of the &s;alvation of all men, any of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture referred to above, nor any pa&s;&s;age, which relates to &s;alvation by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>BESIDE; if the damned be led to repentance by the torments of hell, by whom are tho&s;e torments inflicted? Not by Chri&s;t it &s;eems, becau&s;e that would imply, that Chri&s;t came not to deliver all who &s;hall be finally happy, from the cur&s;e of the law; but to inflict that cur&s;e on a part of them. By whom then will tho&s;e torments, tho&s;e mo&s;t excellent means of grace, be admini&s;tered? Is not Chri&s;t the judge of all men? The father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the &s;on. We mu&s;t all &s;tand at his judgment &s;eat and receive according to that which we &s;hall have done in the body whether good or evil: and he will &s;ay; Depart, ye cur&s;ed, into ever|la&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</P>
<P N="4">4. IF the penalty of the law con&s;i&s;t in that puni&s;hment, which is nece&s;&s;ary to lead to repentance, then all the damned, if brought to repentance at all, are delivered out of hell, not on the footing of <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>mercy,</HI> or of <HI>fa|vour</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s;</HI> but on the footing of the &s;tricte&s;t ju&s;tice; not on the footing of the go&s;pel, but of the rigour of law.&mdash;By the pre&s;ent hypothe&s;is, the damned all &s;uffer that puni&s;hment, which is nece&s;&s;ary to lead them to repentance, and therein &s;uffer the cur&s;e of the law, or all that puni&s;hment which the utmo&s;t rigour of law and ju&s;tice denounces or can inflict. If the Deity him&s;elf were to proceed in puni&s;hing, one &s;tep beyond this line, he would exceed the bounds of ju&s;tice, would ri&s;e in oppo&s;ition to his own perfections, would deny him&s;elf; in &s;hort, would no longer be God. Therefore as &s;oon as a &s;inner

He is under no nece&s;&s;ity to have recour&s;e to the go&s;pel, he may in&s;i&s;t on his per&s;onal right, on the foot|ing of the law. He hath &s;atisfied the law; he hath &s;ati&s;|fied the ju&s;tice of God; it hath taken its cour&s;e on him; he hath nothing more to fear from it; and he mu&s;t be delivered from further puni&s;hment or el&s;e he is injured, he is oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>NAY; to plead for mercy or favour in order to his deli|verance, is not merely needle&s;s; it is out of character, it is degrading him&s;elf who &s;tands right with re&s;pect to the law, to the place of one who is obnoxious to &s;till further puni&s;hment. It implies that he is ignorant of his own character and relation to the Deity and his law. Equally out of character would he act, if on his deliverance, he &s;hould render prai&s;e or thanks, either to God the father, or to his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Surely a man condemned by a civil judge, to receive forty &s;tripes &s;ave one, after he has recived them, is under no obligation to render prai&s;e or thanks for his relea&s;e, either to the judge or to the ex|ecutive officer.</P>
<P>BUT how are the&s;e things reconcileable with the &s;crip|tures? Surely the&s;e con&s;equences fairly deducible from the hypothe&s;is under con&s;ideration, are entirely incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the go&s;pel; and the hypothe&s;is it&s;elf cannot con|&s;i&s;tently be embraced by any believer in the New Te&s;ta|ment.</P>
<P>PARTICULARLY: This hypothe&s;is precludes all po&s;&s;i|bility of <HI>forgivene&s;s</HI> of the damned, even, on the &s;uppo&s;i|tion that they are finally to be admitted to heavenly hap|pine&s;s.&mdash;Forgivne&s;s implies, that the &s;inner forgiven is not puni&s;hed in his own per&s;on, according to law and ju&s;tice. But on the hypothe&s;is under con&s;ideration in this chapter, all the damned, are in their own per&s;ons puni&s;hed according to law and ju&s;tice, in that they &s;uffer that puni&s;hment, which is nece&s;&s;ary to lead them to re|pentance. Who would think of telling a man, who has in his own per&s;on, received the corporal puni&s;hment, to which he had been condemned, that the crime for which he received that puni&s;hment, is freely forgiven him!
<PB N="33" REF="022478_0038_0FB935A1F8EDE210">
This would be adding in&s;ult to the rigour of ju&s;tice.&mdash; But according to the &s;criptures, it &s;eems there is no &s;al|vation on the footing of the law, or without forgivne&s;s. Therefore either it mu&s;t be made to appear, that the &s;criptures do admit the idea, that &s;ome men will be receiv|ed to heaven on the footing of law, and without forgiv|ne&s;s of &s;ins; or the hypothe&s;is, that the puni&s;hment, which is &s;ufficient to lead to repentance, is the cur&s;e of the law, mu&s;t be renounced.</P>
<P N="5">5. ALL men who are by any means brought to repent|ance, whether by the torment of hell or any other cau&s;e, are on the footing of ju&s;tice entitled to perfect &s;ub&s;equent impunity. By the &s;uppo&s;ition, the &s;ole ju&s;t end of all the puni&s;hment inflicted by the Deity, is the repentance of the &s;inner. But this end is already obtained in all who are the &s;ubjects of repentance. Therefore to puni&s;h them is to inflict pain or mi&s;ery for no ju&s;t end whatever. But that the Deity &s;hould inflict mi&s;ery for no ju&s;t end, is for him to commit inju&s;tice and wanton cruelty, which is im|po&s;&s;ible. What then is become of the cur&s;e or penalty of the divine law? The apo&s;tle declares, "Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them." This &s;eems to import, that eve|ry tran&s;gre&s;&s;or is expo&s;ed to a cur&s;e. But he who tran&s;gre&s;&s;es in ever &s;o many in&s;tances, and then whether &s;ooner or later repents, whether his repentance be ef|fected by mercies, or by judgments, or by any other cau&s;e, is expo&s;ed to no cur&s;e, no puni&s;hment whatever; nor can without inju&s;tice be made the &s;ubject of any. On this &s;cheme, if there be any cur&s;e in the law, it mu&s;t, be <HI>re|pentance it&s;elf.</HI> By the cur&s;e of the law, is doubtle&s;s meant the ill con&s;equence, to which the &s;inner is by law and ju&s;tice &s;ubjected, on account of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.&mdash; BUT according to the &s;cheme now before us, repent|tance, when&s;oever and by what cau&s;e &s;oever it may exi&s;t in a &s;inner, is all the ill con&s;equence (if it may be &s;o call|ed) to which he is by law and ju&s;tice &s;ubjected on account of any &s;in or &s;ins. This therefore with re&s;pect to him is the whole cur&s;e of the law, and can this be true? "Chri&s;t hath redeemed us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us."

The end of all puni&s;hment is the remo|val or prevention of evil: and the evil to be removed or prevented by puni&s;hment, and which is the only ground of puni&s;hment, is the only evil of &s;in. But the hypothe&s;is which we are oppo&s;ing throughout this chapter is, that the only ju&s;t ends of puni&s;hment, are the repentance and good of the &s;inner him&s;elf; that is, the removal or pre|vention of per&s;onal evil to the &s;inner, is the only ju&s;t end of puni&s;hing him.

All that puni&s;hment which it de|&s;erves, is either contained in &s;in at the time it is commit|ted, or it follows afterward, as a natural and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, without any pain inflicted by the Deity; and to inflict any the lea&s;t pain on the &s;inner, as a puni&s;hment of his &s;in, is manife&s;tly unju&s;t and ab&s;urd.&mdash;If a child, in con&s;equence of thru&s;ting its finger into a candle, &s;hould &s;uffer great pain, &s;urely it would not, be&s;ide that pain, de&s;erve cha&s;ti&s;ement: becau&s;e all the evil of its impru|dence con&s;i&s;ts in bringing on it&s;elf that pain, and that pain it&s;elf is the full puni&s;hment of the imprudence. Therefore to inflict any further puni&s;hment mu&s;t be unju&s;t and cruel.&mdash;To apply this; all the moral evil of which the &s;inner is guilty, con&s;i&s;ts in bringing pain or lo&s;s on him&s;elf, and to puni&s;h him for this, is as ab&s;urd, as to puni&s;h the child ju&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed; or to puni&s;h a man becau&s;e he will walk with pebbles in his &s;hoes, will whip him|&s;elf, or will bring on him&s;elf the pain of hunger, by go|ing without his ordinary meal.</P>

This is &s;o plain, that not a word need be &s;aid to elucidate it. Therefore if Chri&s;t were to &s;ave any man from the cur&s;e of the law, he would deprive him of the be&s;t mean of grace, which he does or can enjoy; and this &s;alvation it&s;elf, &s;o far from a ble&s;&s;ing to the &s;inner, would be an infinitely greater cur&s;e, then the cur&s;e of the law; becau&s;e it would deprive him of a nece&s;&s;ary and mo&s;t ex|cellent mean of grace, the puni&s;hment which is nece&s;&s;ary to lead him to repentance.

But that &s;uch a puni&s;hment is inflicted on all the damned, is &s;uppo&s;ed by all who e&s;pou&s;e the principle, which I am now oppo&s;ing. Therefore in that very doctrine, in which they mean to oppo&s;e all vindictive puni&s;hment, they in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e hold it, by holding that &s;uch puni&s;hment as is conducive to the good of the &s;ufferer, is all which ju&s;tice admits.</P>
<P>IF they &s;hould &s;ay, that the puni&s;hment of the damned is not <HI>merely</HI> vindictive; but at the &s;ame time di&s;ciplinary too, and therefore ju&s;t: though if it were <HI>merely</HI> vindic|tive, it would be <HI>unju&s;t:</HI> I an&s;wer, the pre&s;ent que&s;tion entirely re&s;pects puni&s;hment which is <HI>merely</HI> di&s;ciplinary. Therefore to allow, that the puni&s;hment of the damned is partly vindictive, is to give up this que&s;tion, and to &s;ub|&s;titute another.&mdash;Be&s;ide; if a vindictive puni&s;hment be unju&s;t, how can it become ju&s;t by being connected with a puni&s;hment, which is ju&s;t? To correct a child, to gratify a malicious temper, is doubtle&s;s unju&s;t. Now, if a man correct his child from two motives, partly from malice, and partly from a view to the good of the child; the ju&s;|tice of his conduct, &s;o far as he is influenced by the latter motive, can never render his conduct ju&s;t, &s;o far as it pro|ceeds from the former.</P>
<P>A vindictive puni&s;hment is that which is inflicted with a de&s;ign to &s;upport the authority of a broken law, and of a di&s;pi&s;ed government: And if the puni&s;hment be ju&s;t, it is at the &s;ame time according to the conduct or demerit of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or. This is demanded by every law; and if the law be ju&s;t, it is ju&s;tly demanded: Or in other words, &s;uch a puni&s;hment of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a ju&s;t law, as is &s;ufficient to &s;upport the authority of that law, is a ju&s;t pu|ni&s;hment. At the &s;ame time it is a puni&s;hment as truly, and to as high a degree vindictive, as ju&s;tice will admit. Now if that puni&s;hment which is nece&s;&s;ary to lead the &s;in|ner to repentance, be &s;ufficient thus to &s;upport the autho|rity and dignity of the divine law and government, and be inflicted for this end; it is to the highe&s;t degree vin|dictive, and de&s;ignedly vindictive. If it be not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer tho&s;e ends, it is not the whole puni&s;hment,
<PB N="38" REF="022478_0043_0FB935AA55963EC0">
which the divine law and ju&s;tice demand: For as I have before ob&s;erved, every ju&s;t and wi&s;e law demands that puni&s;hment which is nece&s;&s;ary to its own &s;upport or exi&s;t|ence, and ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom enforce this demand.</P>
<P>Therefore let the advocates for univer&s;al &s;alvation make their choice. If they &s;hall choo&s;e to hold agreeably to the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, that &s;uch puni&s;hment as is nece&s;&s;ary to lead to repentance, is all that can ju&s;tly be inflicted on the &s;inner, and that therefore it is &s;ufficient to &s;upport the authority and dignity of the divine law and government; they &s;tand convicted of holding, that the puni&s;hment of the damned is by no means merely di&s;ciplinary, but to the highe&s;t degree vindictive. If on the other hand, they choo&s;e to hold, that the puni&s;hment which is nece&s;&s;ary to lead the &s;inner to repentance, is not adequate to the pur|po&s;es before mentioned; then they mu&s;t renounce the principle, which we have been &s;o long con&s;idering, and allow the divine law does denounce a further puni&s;hment, than that which is nece&s;&s;ary to lead the &s;inner to repen|tance, and is a mere di&s;cipline. Becau&s;e the divine law being perfectly ju&s;t, does ju&s;tly, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ad|mit of that puni&s;hment, which is &s;ufficient to its own &s;up|port or exi&s;tence.&mdash;Thus on either &s;uppo&s;ition, they mu&s;t renounce a very favourite tenet.</P>
<P N="11">11.

By the law is the knowledge of &s;in; but by it we know nothing of any good, to be obtained by repentance, whether in the way of favour, or in the way of ju&s;tice. The doctrine of any advantage to be obtained by repentance, is a doctrine of the go&s;pel only, not of the law. Yet if it be unju&s;t to puni&s;h a &s;in|ner with any other view, than to lead him to repentance, this doctrine would undoubtedly be found in the law.

This would imply, that it de&s;erves a reward.&mdash;Nor is it a dictate of common &s;en&s;e, that it be followed with neither natural good nor natural evil. This would imply, that it is worthy of neither prai&s;e nor blame, reward nor puni&s;hment; and therefore is neither a mo|ral good nor a moral evil. Both which conclu&s;ions are ab&s;urd. Therefore it remains, that it is a dictate of rea|&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, that moral evil be followed with natural evil.&mdash;Or if it be further urged, that it is a dictate of common &s;en&s;e, that moral evil con&s;idering the <HI>infinite goodne&s;s and mercy of God,</HI> &s;hould be followed with no natural evil; it is to be ob&s;erved, that this is giving up the ground of ju&s;tice, and going on that of goodne&s;s and mercy, which is entirely foreign to the &s;ubject of this chapter. The inquiry of this chapter is what &s;in de&s;erves <HI>on the footing of ju&s;tice,</HI> not what it will actually &s;uffer on the footing the divine infinite <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> and <HI>mercy.</HI> This latter inquiry &s;hall be carefully attended to in its place, chapter VIII.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="022478_0045_0FB935B3A82C3DA0">AGAIN; Moral evil is in it&s;elf, or in its own nature, odious and the proper object of di&s;approbation and abhor|rence. By its own nature I mean its tendency to evil, the di&s;honour of the Deity and the mi&s;ery or diminution of the happine&s;s of the created &s;y&s;tem. Therefore it is not injurious to the per&s;on who perpetrates moral evil, to di&s;approve, hate and abhor it in it&s;elf, a&s;ide from all con|&s;ideration of the con&s;equences of &s;uch di&s;approbation, whether &s;uch con&s;equences be to the perpetrator per&s;onal|ly good or bad. Hence it follows, that it is not injuri|ous to the perpetrator of moral evil, to manife&s;t di&s;appro|bation of his conduct, &s;o far as morally evil, whether &s;uch manife&s;tation be &s;ub&s;ervient to his good or not. And if <HI>&s;in</HI> be a moral evil, it is not injurious to the &s;inner, both to di&s;approve, and to manife&s;t di&s;approbation of &s;in, whether &s;uch manife&s;tation be &s;ub&s;ervient to his good or not.&mdash;But this directly contradicts the principle, that &s;in de&s;erves no other puni&s;hment, than that which is &s;ub|&s;ervient to the good of the &s;inner. For what is puni&s;h|ment, but a manife&s;tation of di&s;approbation, which a per|&s;on ve&s;ted with authority has, of the conduct of a &s;ub|ject? And if it be not injurious to the &s;inner, to di&s;ap|prove his &s;in, and to manife&s;t that di&s;approbation, whe|ther it &s;ub&s;erve his good or not; then his &s;in, or he on account of his &s;in, de&s;erves both di&s;approbation, and the manife&s;tation of di&s;approbation, though that manife&s;ta|tion be not &s;ub&s;ervient to his per&s;onal good: which is the &s;ame thing as to &s;ay, that the &s;inner de&s;erves puni&s;hment, whether that puni&s;hment &s;ub&s;erve his own good or not. On the other hand, if it be not ju&s;t to manife&s;t di&s;appro|bation of &s;in, it is not ju&s;t to di&s;approve &s;in. If it be not ju&s;t to di&s;approve or to hate &s;in, a&s;ide from the con&s;idera|tion, that the di&s;approbation is conducive to the per&s;onal good of the &s;inner; then &s;in is not in it&s;elf, or in its own nature and tendency, hateful or odious, but becomes odi|ous then only, when the hatred of it conduces to the per|&s;onal good of the &s;inner. But if &s;in be not in it&s;elf odi|ous, it is not a moral evil; which was the thing to be proved.</P>

but by holding, that <HI>moral evil</HI> is not in it&s;elf odious and abominable, but that it becomes odious then only, when the di&s;approbation of it &s;ub&s;erves the per&s;onal good of the perpetrator: which is the &s;ame as to hold, that moral e|vil, as &s;uch, is not at all odious, but is odious in this par|ticular ca&s;e only, when the di&s;approbation of it &s;ub&s;erves the good of the perpetrator: but in all other ca&s;es, it is a matter of indifferency at lea&s;t, if not an object of cordial complacency; and therefore in all other ca&s;es is no mo|ral evil.</P>
<P>ON the &s;uppo&s;ition which I am now oppo&s;ing, when a man &s;ins and immediately repents, he de&s;erves no puni&s;h|ment, becau&s;e the end of all puni&s;hment is already ob|tained by his repentance, and a tendency of puni&s;hment to the repentance of the &s;inner, which is the only circum|&s;tance, on the pre&s;ent hypothe&s;is which can ju&s;tify his puni&s;hment, cannot now be pretended, as a rea&s;on for his puni&s;hment. Therefore any puni&s;hment after repen|tance, mu&s;t be unde&s;erved and unju&s;t. But if &s;in be a moral evil or a crime, it is in its own nature di&s;plea&s;ing to GOD, and he may ju&s;tly both be di&s;plea&s;ed at it, and manife&s;t his di&s;plea&s;ure; that is, he may puni&s;h it, whe|ther the &s;inner repent or not, Repentance though it is a renunciation of &s;in in future, makes no alteration in the nature of the &s;in which is pa&s;t; nor is it any &s;atisfaction for that &s;in. If it were, it would be either <HI>the cur&s;e of the law,</HI> or &s;uch a meritorius act of virtue, as to balance the demerit of &s;in: Neither of which will be pretended. But if the only rea&s;on why it is, or can be ju&s;t for GOD to &s;hew di&s;plea&s;ure at &s;in, be, that the &s;inner may thereby be led to repentance; then &s;in it&s;elf, or the proper nature of &s;in, is not a ju&s;t rea&s;on, why God &s;hould either be di&s;|plea&s;ed, or &s;how di&s;plea&s;ure at it. Impenitence or the repetition of &s;in or the continuance of the &s;inner in it, is on this &s;uppo&s;ition, the only ju&s;t rea&s;on or ground of ei|ther di&s;plea&s;ure, or of any manife&s;tation of di&s;plea&s;ure at &s;in.

think it would be manife&s;t to every man, that we denied, that &s;in as &s;uch, and by the general nature common to all &s;ins, de&s;erves puni&s;hment; and that we confined the de&s;ert of puni&s;hment to &s;omething which is merely accidental, and not at all e&s;&s;ential to &s;in. And is it not manife&s;t, that the de&s;ert of puni&s;hment is as really not extended to the general nature of &s;in, but is confined to &s;omething merely accidental, when it is a&s;&s;erted, that &s;in de&s;erves no puni&s;h|ment, unle&s;s it be followed with impenitence? or unle&s;s it be per&s;i&s;ted in? or, which is the &s;ame thing, that no pun|i&s;hment is ju&s;t, except that which is de&s;igned to lead the &s;inner to repentance?</P>
<P>IF &s;in do not by its general nature de&s;erve puni&s;hment, it does not by its general nature de&s;erve the manife&s;tation of divine di&s;plea&s;ure; becau&s;e all manife&s;tation of divine di&s;|plea&s;ure at &s;in, is puni&s;hment.&mdash;Again, if &s;in do not by its general nature de&s;erve the manife&s;tation of divine di&s;plea|&s;ure, it does not by its general nature de&s;erve di&s;plea&s;ure it|&s;elf: and if &s;o, it is not by its general nature a moral evil.</P>
<P>IT appears then, that on the hypothe&s;is now under con&s;ideration, &s;in de&s;erves neither puni&s;hment nor hatred, and is no moral evil, unle&s;s it be followed with impeni|tence; or unle&s;s it be per&s;i&s;ted in, for at lea&s;t &s;ome time. The fir&s;t act of &s;in is no moral evil. But if the fir&s;t act be not a moral evil, why is the &s;econd, the third, or any &s;ub&s;equent act? Impenitence is nothing but a repe|tition or per&s;everance in acts the &s;ame or &s;imilar to that of which we do not repent. But if the fir&s;t act, ab&s;tract|ed from the &s;ub&s;equent, be not a moral evil, what rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why the &s;ub&s;equent &s;hould be a moral evil? Thus the principle, that &s;in de&s;erves puni&s;hment &s;o far only, as the puni&s;hment of it tends to the repentance and good of the &s;inner, implies, that there is no moral evil in the univer&s;e, either in the fir&s;t &s;in, or in any which follow; none even in impenitence it&s;elf.&mdash;On the other hand, if &s;in in all in&s;tances be a moral evil, it is ju&s;tly to be abhorred by the Deity, whether repentance &s;ucceed or not: and if it may ju&s;tly be abhorred by the Deity, he may ju&s;tly manife&s;t his abhorrence of it, whe|ther repentance &s;ucceed or not. But to allow this, is to give up the principle, that &s;in de&s;erves no other puni&s;h|ment, than that which is &s;ub&s;ervient to the repentance and good of the &s;inner.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="022478_0048_0FB935B9FACF3CA0">PUNISHMENT is a proper manife&s;tation of di&s;plea&s;ure, made by a per&s;on in authority, at &s;ome crime or moral e|vil.

<P>PERHAPS it may be objected to the rea&s;oning in the la&s;t argument, that if it prove any thing, it proves too much, and therefore really proves nothing; that if &s;in, or any crime, do in all ca&s;es, and on account of its own <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and turpitude, de&s;erve di&s;approbation and puni&s;h|ment, it will follow, that it de&s;erves the &s;ame, even after it has been puni&s;hed according to &s;trict di&s;tributive ju&s;tice; that after &s;uch puni&s;hment the nature of the crime is the &s;ame which it was before; that the crime therefore is &s;till the proper object of di&s;approbation, and of the mani|fe&s;tation of di&s;approbation; and on the ground of the pre|ceding rea&s;oning, de&s;erves an additional puni&s;hment, af|ter it has been once puni&s;hed according to &s;trict di&s;tributive ju&s;tice; which is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>TO this it may be an&s;wered, that a crime con&s;idered in connection with its ju&s;t and full puni&s;hment, is not that crime con&s;idered, <HI>in it&s;elf,</HI> or <HI>in its own nature mere|ly.</HI> Water mingled with wine, and thus become a com|pound &s;ub&s;tance, is no longer mere water.

But if the meaning of that expre&s;&s;ion be, that a crime con&s;idered in connection with its ju&s;t puni&s;h|ment and the good effects of that puni&s;hment, as one com|plex object, is a proper object of di&s;approbation, &s;o that it is proper to wi&s;h, that this complex object had not come into exi&s;tence; it is not true that in this &s;en&s;e a crime af|ter it has been puni&s;hed according to &s;trict di&s;tributive ju&s;|ice, is &s;till the ju&s;t object of di&s;approbation.

Therefore the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e crimes taken with the puni&s;hments, as one complex object, is no proper object of di&s;approbation or deprecation, but of acquie&s;cence and joy: becau&s;e in this connection they tend not to impair, but e&s;tabli&s;h and promote the general good. In this &s;en&s;e any crime or any &s;in, after it has been puni&s;hed according to &s;trict di&s;tributive ju&s;tice, is not the ju&s;t object of di&s;ap|probation, and therefore not of the manife&s;tation of di&s;|approbation

Now therefore &s;in taken with the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of it, no more tends to impair the good of the univer&s;e, than poi&s;on taken with an ef|fectual antidote, tends to de&s;troy the life of him who takes it.</P>
<P>Objection. 1.

Yet the compound made by the mixture, produces no &s;uch effects, is of no &s;uch tendency, and con&s;equently is of a very different na|ture. So any &s;in which is puni&s;hed according to &s;trict ju|&s;tice, ab&s;tracted from the puni&s;hment, is of the &s;ame ten|dency and nature, of which it was before the puni&s;hment. Yet that &s;in taken with its full and ju&s;t puni&s;hment, as one complex object, is of a very different tendency and nature, and will be followed with no &s;uch effects as would have followed from it, had it not been puni&s;hed.

<P>Objection. 2. If the &s;inner do not de&s;erve puni&s;hment, when the ill con&s;equences of his &s;in are prevented by his per&s;onal puni&s;hment; why does he de&s;erve puni&s;hment, when the ill con&s;equences are prevented by the &s;ufferings of his &s;ub&s;titute?&mdash;An&s;wer.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Whether the damned will <HI>in fact</HI> &s;uffer any other puni&s;hment, than that which is conducive to their per&s;onal good.</HEAD>
<P>IN the la&s;t chapter the &s;ubject of inquiry was, whether the damned &s;inner <HI>de&s;erve,</HI> according to &s;trict ju&s;tice and the law of God, any other puni&s;hment, than that which is nece&s;&s;ary to lead to repentance and prepare for happine&s;s. But though it &s;hould be granted, that he does indeed de&s;erve a further or greater puni&s;hment, than that which is &s;ufficient for the ends ju&s;t mentioned; yet it may be pleaded, that in fact he never will &s;uffer any other pun|i&s;hment; that in hell the damned are puni&s;hed with the &s;ole de&s;ign of leading them to repentance; that when this de&s;ign &s;hall have been accompli&s;hed, whatever further puni&s;hment they may de&s;erve, will be graciou&s;ly remitted, and they immediately received to cele&s;tial felicity. Whe|ther this be indeed the truth, is the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent inquiry.&mdash;With regard to this &s;ubject, I have to propo&s;e the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. If the damned do indeed de&s;erve more puni&s;hment, than is &s;ufficient barely to lead them to repentance; then they may, con&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice, be made in fact to &s;uf|fer more. That they may con&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice be made to &s;uffer according to their demerits, is a &s;elf-evident pro|po&s;ition. To puni&s;h them &s;o far, is not at all incon&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;tice of God, therefore the objection drawn from the ju&s;tice of God again&s;t vindictive puni&s;hment as oppo&s;ed to mere di&s;cipline, mu&s;t be wholly relinqui&s;hed. A merely di&s;ciplinary puni&s;hment is one which is &s;uited and de&s;igned to lead the &s;inner to repentance only. A vindic|tive puni&s;hment is one which is de&s;igned to be a te&s;timony of the di&s;plea&s;ure of God at the conduct of the &s;inner, and
<PB N="49" REF="022478_0054_0FB935C3C463D720">
by that te&s;timony, to &s;upport the authority of the divine law, &s;ub&s;erve the general good, and thus &s;atisfy ju&s;tice: and it mu&s;t be no more than adequate to the demerit of the &s;inner. I do not find that Dr. C. has in his whole book, given us a definition of a vindictive puni&s;hment, as he ought mo&s;t certainly to have done. According to Che|valier <HI>Ram&s;ay's</HI> definition of divine vindictive ju&s;tice, vin|dictive puni&s;hment is,
<Q>That di&s;pen&s;ation of God, by which he pur&s;ues vice with all &s;orts of torments, till it is totally extirpated, de&s;troyed and annihilated.</Q>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">Principles, Vol. I. P. 434.</NOTE> What then is a di&s;ciplinary puni&s;hment? This definition perfectly confounds di&s;ciplinary and vindictive puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>IF it be ju&s;t to puni&s;h a &s;inner according to his demerit; as it certainly is by the very terms; and if &s;uch a puni&s;h|ment be greater than is &s;ufficient to lead him to repentance merely; as is now &s;uppo&s;ed: then all objections drawn from the ju&s;tice of God, again&s;t a vindictive puni&s;hment, and all arguments from the &s;ame topic, in favour of a pun|i&s;hment merely di&s;ciplinary, are perfectly groundle&s;s and futile. The &s;inner lies at mercy; and if he be relea&s;ed on his repentance, it is an act of grace, and not of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF the damned <HI>do de&s;erve</HI> more puni&s;hment than is &s;ufficient barely to lead them to repentance, they will <HI>in fact</HI> &s;uffer more. As it is ju&s;t, &s;o ju&s;tice will be executed. That they will be puni&s;hed according to their demerits, is capable of clear proof, both by the authority of &s;cripture, and by that of Dr. C.</P>
<P N="1">(1) By the authority of &s;cripture.&mdash;This a&s;&s;ures us, that God will
<Q>render to every man <HI>according to his deeds</HI> to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, indignation and wrath, tri|bulation and angui&s;h upon every &s;oul that doth evil,</Q>

<P>The&s;e texts, it is pre&s;umed, &s;ufficiently &s;hew, that we have the authority of &s;cripture to prove, that in the future world, the wicked will be puni&s;hed accoding to their de|merits, and that no mercy will be &s;hewn them.</P>
<P N="2">(2) The &s;ame truth is evidently holden by Dr. C.&mdash; He a&s;&s;erts, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 10.</NOTE>that

That
<Q><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">P. 320.</NOTE>there will be a difference in the pun|i&s;hment of wicked men, according to the difference there has been in the nature and number of their evil deeds:</Q>
That "<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 336.</NOTE> if they" [the bla&s;phmers of the Holy Gho&s;t are
<Q><PB N="51" REF="022478_0056_0FB935C831FEBC90">not &s;aved till after they have pa&s;&s;ed through the&s;e tor|ments</Q>
[of hell]
<Q>they have never been forgiven.&mdash; The divine <HI>law has taken its cour&s;e;</HI> nor has any inter|vening pardon prevented the <HI>full execution of the threat|ened penalty.</HI></Q>
Some ob&s;ervations have been already <NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 2, &amp;c.</NOTE> made on the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages concerning the bla&s;phemers of the Holy Gho&s;t, to &s;how, that on Dr. C's plan they equally prove, that all the damned are &s;aved without forgivene&s;s; that the divine law has its cour&s;e on them all; that they all &s;uffer the full threatened penalty, and of cour&s;e they &s;uffer all that puni&s;hment which they de&s;erve.</P>
<P>THE other quotations &s;et this matter in a light equally clear. If the wicked &s;hall be puni&s;hed in proportion to the number and greatne&s;s of their vices; in proportion to the number and greatne&s;s of their crimes; according to the na|ture and number of their evil deeds; in proportion to their de&s;erts; they will mo&s;t certainly receive the full puni&s;h|ment due to them according to their demerits, and nothing will be remitted to them.</P>
<P>THUS it appears both by the authority of &s;cripture and al&s;o by that of Dr. C. that the damned will actually &s;uffer all that puni&s;hment, which they de&s;erve. And as it is now &s;uppo&s;ed to be proved in the preceding chapter, that the damned de&s;erve a further puni&s;hment than that which is conducive to their repentance and per&s;onal good; of cour&s;e it follows, that they will in fact &s;uffer &s;uch further puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>OBJECTION.&mdash;The argument from the &s;criptural de|clarations, that the wicked &s;hall be puni&s;hed according to their works &amp;c, to prove, that they will &s;uffer all which they ju&s;tly de&s;erve, is not conclu&s;ive; becau&s;e the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed concerning the righteous, &s;etting forth, <HI>that they &s;hall be rewarded according to their works</HI> &amp;c. Yet it is granted on all hands, that their reward is not merely &s;uch as they de&s;erve, or is not &s;trictly according to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>ANSWER. The reward of the righteous is indeed not merely &s;uch as they de&s;erve, but infinitely exceeds their de&s;erts. It is therefore at lea&s;t equal to their de&s;erts; or it falls not &s;hort of them. If this be allowed concerning the puni&s;hment of the wicked, it is &s;ufficient for every purpo&s;e of the preceding argument. If the wicked &s;uffer a puni&s;hment at lea&s;t equal to their demerits; then no part of the puni&s;hment de&s;erved by them, is remitted to them.
<PB N="52" REF="022478_0057_0FB935CA9A57F520">
Be&s;ide; the declarations of &s;cripture are, that the wicked &s;hall pay the uttermo&s;t farthing, the very la&s;t mite; that they &s;hall have judgment without mercy, wrath with|out mixture, &amp;c. which are as &s;trong and determinate expre&s;&s;ions, to repre&s;ent that they will be puni&s;hed to the full extent of ju&s;tice, as can be conceived.</P>
<P N="3">3. ALTHOUGH Dr. C. is &s;o great an enemy to vindict|ive puni&s;hment; yet he him&s;elf, holds that men do even in this life &s;uffer &s;uch puni&s;hment.
<Q>But do tho&s;e te&s;ti|monies of his <HI>vengeance</HI> lo&s;e their nature as <HI>judgments</HI> on his part, and <HI>real evils</HI> on their's, becau&s;e they may be an occa&s;ion of that repentance, which &s;hall i&s;&s;ue in their &s;alvation? When God threatened the Jewi&s;h nation, in ca&s;e they would not do his commandments, with famine, the pe&s;tilence, the &s;word, and a di&s;per&s;ion into all parts of the earth; did he threaten them with a <HI>benefit</HI>? And when tho&s;e threatenings were for their &s;ins carried into execution, did he inflict a <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> on them? When he threatened in particular, that if they where di&s;obedient, they &s;hould be <HI>cur&s;ed</HI> in the field, Deut. XXVIII. 16, did he hereby intend, that the <HI>field</HI> &s;hould be cur&s;ed; but that he meant thereby <HI>a real benefit</HI> to <HI>them</HI>?</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">5 Di&s;&s;ertations, P. 110.</NOTE>If vindictive puni&s;hment be in|flicted even in this life, much more may we conclude that it is inflicted in hell, the proper place of retribution to the wicked.</P>
<P N="4">4. IF the puni&s;hment of hell be a mere di&s;cipline hap|pily conducive to the good of the &s;ufferers, there is no forgivene&s;s in the pre&s;ervation of a man from it. It is no forgivene&s;s for a parent to give his child a li|cence to tarry from &s;chool; or for a phy&s;ician to allow his patient to de&s;i&s;t from the cold bath, which he had pre|&s;cribed. Or if a parent, to inure his child to hunger and cold, have kept him for &s;ome time on a &s;canty diet, and have clothed him but thinly; it is no act of forgivene&s;s, to allow the child in future a full diet, or warm cloth|ing. Forgivene&s;s is to remit a <HI>de&s;erved penalty,</HI> or to ex|empt from <HI>penal</HI> evil; not to deprive of a benefit, or of any thing which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our happine&s;s, and which is therefore on the whole no real evil, but a real good. If therefore there be nothing more <HI>penal</HI> or <HI>vindictive</HI> in the puni&s;hment of hell, than in the cold
<PB N="53" REF="022478_0058_0FB935CBEACE5020">
bath, or in the &s;canty diet and thin clothing ju&s;t men|tioned; there is no more of forgivene&s;s in exemption from the former, than in exemption from the latter.&mdash; Thus the &s;cheme of di&s;ciplinary puni&s;hment in hell leads to a conclu&s;ion utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the whole tenor of &s;cripture, and of the writings of Dr. C.</P>
<P N="5">5. ALL tho&s;e texts which &s;peak of the divine <HI>vengeance, fury, wrath, indignation, fiery</HI> indignation, &amp;c. hold forth &s;ome other puni&s;hment, than that which is merely di&s;ciplinary. The texts to which I refer are &s;uch as the&s;e; Deut. XXXII. 41,

<P>IT is of no importance, that in &s;ome of the texts now quot|ed, a reference is not had to the puni&s;hments of the future
<PB N="54" REF="022478_0059_0FB935D01F1C4390">
world, but to tho&s;e of this life. If God can con&s;i&s;tently with his perfections inflict a partial vengeance, why not the whole of that which is ju&s;tly due? If he can and does inflict vengeance in this life, why not in the future too, provided, as is now granted, it be ju&s;t?</P>
<P>THAT the pa&s;&s;ages now quoted, do indeed &s;peak of a puni&s;hment more than merely di&s;ciplinary, is manife&s;t by the very terms of the pa&s;&s;ages them&s;elves. To &s;ay that <HI>vengeance, wrath, fury, indignation, fiery indignation, wrath without mixture,</HI> mean a mere whole&s;ome, fatherly di&s;ci|pline, de&s;igned for the good only of the &s;ubjects, is to &s;ay that the in&s;pired writers were gro&s;&s;ly ignorant of the proper and common u&s;e of language; and particularly that they were wholly ignorant of that important di&s;|tinction between vindictive and di&s;ciplinary puni&s;hment, on which Dr. C. and other writers of his cla&s;s &s;o much in&s;i&s;t. If vengeance mean fatherly di&s;cipline, what is pro|per vengeance? If it be proper to call fatherly cha&s;ti&s;e|ment, vengeance, wrath, fury, fiery indignation, wrath without mixture; by what name is it proper to call a puni&s;hment really vindictive?</P>
<P N="6">6. THE &s;ame may be argued from various other pa&s;&s;ag|es of &s;cripture, &s;ome of which I &s;hall now cite. 1 Cor. XVI. 22.
<Q>If any man love not our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, let him be anathema maranatha.</Q>
It is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that this cur&s;e means a di&s;cipline de&s;igned for the good on|ly of the patients. Such a di&s;cipline is &s;o far from a cur&s;e, that it is a very great ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash;Deut. XXVII. 26, compared with Gal. III. 10,

&mdash;This text &s;eems to be in &s;everal re&s;pects incon&s;i&s;tent with the idea, that

But to inflict that puni&s;hment only, which is far le&s;s than the &s;inner de&s;erves, and which is not at all vindictive, but wholly conducive to his good, is very greatly to <HI>&s;pare</HI> him. It is further &s;aid, that the

&s;uffer the cur&s;e of God. Whether all the&s;e texts refer to a cur&s;e to be inflicted after death, does not for rea&s;ons al|ready given materially affect the pre&s;ent argument. A cur&s;e is undoubtedly a puni&s;hment which does not promote the good of the &s;ubject&punc; otherwi&s;e a cur&s;e and a ble&s;&s;ing are perfectly confounded.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hall &s;till be in&s;i&s;ted, that the cur&s;e &s;o often men|tioned, means that puni&s;hment only, which is conducive to the good of the &s;ubject: it may be an&s;wered, then there would be no impropriety in calling the pre&s;ent af|flictions of the real di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, by the name of a cur&s;e. Why then are they not &s;o called in &s;cripture? Why are not the real children of God, even the mo&s;t vir|tuous and pious of them, &s;aid to be cur&s;ed by God, &amp;c.? And why are not the cur&s;es of the wicked, as well as the afflictions of the righteous, &s;aid to work together for their good, and to work out for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory? Dr. C. loves to illu&s;trate the puni&s;hment of hell by the di&s;cipline inflicted by fathers on earth&punc; with a &s;ole view to the good of their children. But would it be proper to call the nece&s;&s;ary, wi&s;e and whole&s;ome di&s;cipline of earthly parents, by the name of a <HI>cur&s;e?</HI> or is it ever &s;o called, either by God or man?&mdash; Equally ab&s;urd is it, to call the puni&s;hment of hell by that name, if it be de&s;igned for the good only of the pa|tients.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech the reader to con&s;ider what a contra&s;t there is between the texts, which have now been quoted, and tho&s;e in which a puni&s;hment really di&s;ciplinary is mention|ed and de&s;cribed. In the former the puni&s;hment is called by the names of <HI>vengeance, fury, wrath, &s;moaking</HI> wrath, <HI>fiery indignation,</HI> wrath <HI>without mixture,</HI> a <HI>cur&s;e,</HI> an <HI>ana|thema, all the cur&s;es of the law, &amp;c.</HI> Whereas the real di&s;cipline of God's children is called a <HI>cha&s;ti&s;ement</HI>;
<Q>If ye be without cha&s;ti&s;ement, then are ye ba&s;tards and not &s;ons:</Q>
a <HI>correction</HI>&punc;
<Q>I will correct thee in mea|&s;ure, and will not leave thee altogether unpuni&s;hed.</Q>
This correction is &s;aid to be <HI>mingled with pity.</HI>
<Q>Like as a father pitieth his children; &s;o the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</Q>

But where
<PB N="57" REF="022478_0062_0FB935D4B6A23C90">
in all the &s;criptures is the puni&s;hment of the future &s;tate repre&s;ented to be de&s;igned for the good of the &s;ubjects? Where is it in &s;cripture called a fatherly cha&s;ti&s;ement, cor|rection or di&s;cipline, or by any other appellation of the like import? What right then have we to con&s;ider it as a mere cha&s;ti&s;ement? Is not this an idea formed in the fond ima|gination of tho&s;e who would fain &s;upport a favourite &s;y&s;|tem?</P>
<P N="7">7. IF future puni&s;hment be merely di&s;ciplinary, the di&s;cipline will produce its proper effect on &s;ome, &s;ooner than on others. Some who &s;hall in this life have contract|ed a le&s;s degree of depravity and hardne&s;s of heart, will be more ea&s;ily and &s;peedily brought to repentance, than others. This on the hypothe&s;is now made, is both agree|able to the dictates of rea&s;on, and is the very doctrine ex|pre&s;&s;ly and abundantly taught by Dr. C. But how is this to be reconciled with the account of &s;cripture? That in|forms us, that all tho&s;e on the left hand of the judge are to be &s;entenced to everla&s;ting fire, and &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment. The &s;entence denounced on all is in the &s;ame terms, and not the lea&s;t intimation is given, that &s;ome of them &s;hall be puni&s;hed longer than others; much le&s;s that only <HI>&s;ome</HI> &s;hall be puni&s;hed for ages of ages; others relea&s;ed, in a much &s;horter time. Dr. C. and other writers of his cla&s;s &s;uppo&s;e, that in hell the wicked are put under tho&s;e means of grace, which are va&s;tly more advantageous, powerful and conducive to the effect of re|pentance, than tho&s;e means which are enjoyed in this life. But the &s;ame writers will allow, that in many in&s;tances, even the means which are enjoyed in this life are followed with the de&s;ired effect of repentance, and this within &s;o &s;hort a term as three&s;core years and ten. Therefore we may rea&s;onably conclude that within the like term, many more will be brought to repentance by the va&s;tly more powerful means to be u&s;ed with the damned: and &s;o on through every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive period of &s;eventy years. I think then an an&s;wer to two que&s;tions may ju&s;tly be demanded of any one in Dr. C's &s;cheme.</P>
<P N="1">(1) WITH what truth or propriety can a &s;entence of everla&s;ting puni&s;hment be pronounced on the whole body of &s;inners, when &s;ome of them &s;hall repent and be &s;aved very &s;oon; others in large numbers, in every &s;ucceeding
<PB N="58" REF="022478_0063_0FB935D5CA37D840">
age, and even every year? As well might a &s;entence of exclu&s;ion from pardon and the favour of God during this life, be pronounced again&s;t the whole of every generation of mankind, becau&s;e &s;ome men do indeed continue in that &s;tate during this life. Nay, with much greater truth and propriety might this latter &s;entence be pronounced, than the former; becau&s;e it is granted by Dr. C. and others, that the <HI>greater</HI> part of men live and die in impe|nitence and alienation from God. Whereas, allowing that the puni&s;hment of the wicked is a mere di&s;cipline, we may pre&s;ume, that very few indeed of the whole number of the damned, will remain in torment, for that duration, which according to the ideas of our opponents, is intended by <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> and <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> and which is the longe&s;t puni&s;hment to be inflicted on any of the human race. This is a puni&s;hment re&s;erved for a very few, the mo&s;t depraved, hardened, abandoned &s;inners, perhaps one in a thou&s;and or ten thou&s;and. The re&s;t le&s;s hardened and more ea&s;ily wrought on by the powerful means of grace u&s;ed with the damned, will be brought to repentance by a puni&s;hment of &s;horter continuance.</P>
<P>I know Dr. C. &s;ays, that though all the damned &s;hall not, yet as &s;ome of them &s;hall, &s;uffer that puni&s;hment, which in his &s;en&s;e, is everla&s;ting and forever and ever, therefore everla&s;ting puni&s;hment may be truly a&s;&s;erted of them collectively. But the &s;ame rea&s;on would ju&s;tify a &s;entence excluding the whole human race from pardon and the divine &s;avour, during the whole of the pre&s;ent life. God might with the &s;ame truth and propriety have &s;aid to Adam and all his po&s;terity, even after the revelation of the covenant of grace, I doom you, in righteous judgment, to live and die the objects of my wrath. This latter &s;en|tence would, for the rea&s;on before a&s;&s;igned, have been not only equally, but much more conformed to truth and fact, than that which &s;hall be pronounced on the wicked at the end of the world; if they &s;hall be delivered out of hell from time to time in every age and perhaps every year. Yet it is pre&s;umed, no man will plead for the truth and propriety of the &s;entence ju&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2">(2) THE other que&s;tion to which an an&s;wer may be ex|pected, is, how has it come to pa&s;s, that no intimation of a difference in the duration of the puni&s;hment of the
<PB N="59" REF="022478_0064_0FB935D78AFC64A8">
wicked, is hinted in any part of the &s;criptures? The dif|ference between a puni&s;hment of a few years, and one which is to la&s;t for ages of ages, or for &s;uch a duration, as may with propriety be called an <HI>eternity,</HI> is very great, and we &s;hould think, well worthy to be noticed in the &s;criptures. To &s;ay, that it is noticed in tho&s;e texts, which inform us, that the wicked &s;hall be puni&s;hed <HI>accor|ding to their works,</HI> &amp;c. is to beg a point in di&s;pute: be|cau&s;e tho&s;e who believe endle&s;s puni&s;hment, believe that the works of all &s;inners de&s;erve an endle&s;s puni&s;hment; and though they will &s;uffer different puni&s;hments accor|ding to their different demerits; yet the difference will not con&s;i&s;t in duration, but in degree: as the righteous will be rewarded differently according to their works; yet the reward of every individual of the righteous will be of endle&s;s duration.</P>
<P N="8">8. IF future puni&s;hment be de&s;igned as a mere di&s;cipline, to lead &s;inners to repentance, it is inflicted without any nece&s;&s;ity, and therefore mu&s;t be a wanton exerci&s;e of cru|elty.&mdash;The repentance of &s;inners may be ea&s;ily obtained without tho&s;e dreadful torments endured for ages of ages. Doubtle&s;s that &s;ame wi&s;dom and power which leads a goodly number of mankind to repentance in this life, without the help of the torments of hell, might by the like or &s;uperior means, produce the like effect on all. The go&s;pel might have been preached to all the heathens, and all tho&s;e means of grace, which have been &s;ucce&s;sful on &s;ome men, might have been u&s;ed with all. And who will venture to &s;ay, that tho&s;e means and that grace, which effected the repentance of <HI>Saul</HI> the per&s;ecutor, of the thief on the cro&s;s, of <HI>Mary Magdalene,</HI> and of the old, idolatrous <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> who had filled Jeru&s;alem with inno|cent blood; could not have effected the repentance of any, or at lea&s;t &s;ome of tho&s;e who have been, or &s;hall be, &s;ent into the future &s;tate of puni&s;hment? How does it appear, that tho&s;e means and that grace which were &s;ufficient for the conver&s;ion of tho&s;e noted &s;inners before mentioned, would not, had they been applied, have been &s;ufficient for the conver&s;ion of thou&s;ands of others, who in fact have not been converted? And how does it appear, but that &s;imilar though more powerful grace and means, which are doubtle&s;s within the reach of divine power and know|ledge,
<PB N="60" REF="022478_0065_0FB935D8AB438020">
would have been &s;ufficient for the repentance and conver&s;ion of all mankind? If &s;o, the repentance of &s;in|ners might have been accompli&s;hed, at a cheaper rate, and in a way more demon&s;trative of the divine goodne&s;s, than by the awful means of hell-torments. Tho&s;e tor|ments therefore are inflicted without any real nece&s;&s;ity, unle&s;s they be inflicted for &s;ome other end, than the re|pentance of the damned.</P>
<P>I AM aware, it will be objected, that if God &s;hould bring men to repentance by efficacious grace or means, it would be incon&s;i&s;tent with their moral agency, would de&s;troy their liberty, and reduce them to mere machines. But were <HI>Paul, Mary Magdalene</HI> &amp;c. brought to repentance in &s;uch a way as to de&s;troy their liberty? It will not be pretended. Neither can it be pretended, that the &s;ame means and grace would have de&s;troyed the liberty of others. This being granted, it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that if repentance be the only end, hell-torments are arbitra|rily inflicted on all tho&s;e, who might have been, or may in future be brought to repentance by tho&s;e means, and that grace, by which Paul or any other man hath been brought to repentance in this life.&mdash;I a&s;k, does God in this life, apply all tho&s;e means and all that grace, to all men, to lead them to repentance, which are con&s;i&s;tent with their moral agency? And if he apply to any man, more powerful means, or more efficacious grace, than he does apply to him, would he de&s;troy all his liberty and re|duce him to a mere machine? If &s;o, then how are the more powerful means of hell-torments con&s;i&s;tent with mo|ral agency or liberty? They, it is &s;aid, are more power|ful and efficacious means of grace, than any employed in this life: and if in this life the utmo&s;t is done to lead &s;in|ners to repentance, which is con&s;i&s;tent with moral agency; hell-torments mu&s;t entirely de&s;troy moral agency and re|duce poor damned &s;ouls to mere machines; and of cour&s;e they will be no more capable of repentance or &s;alvation, than clocks and watches.</P>
<P>If on the other hand it be &s;aid, that the utmo&s;t which is con&s;i&s;tent with moral agency, is not done in this life, to lead men, to repentance; it will follow, that God choo&s;es to inflict hell-torments, not merely as a nece&s;&s;ary mean to lead &s;inners to repentance; to grant which, is to give up
<PB N="61" REF="022478_0066_0FB935DA610C9DF8">
the whole idea, that they are merely di&s;ciplinary.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e whom I am now oppo&s;ing, hold, that God can|not, con&s;i&s;tently with their moral agency, bring all men to repentance in this life. How then can he, con&s;i&s;tently with their moral agency, bring them to repentance in hell? If tho&s;e means which would be effectual in this life, would be incon&s;i&s;tent with moral agency, why are not hell-torments equally incon&s;i&s;tent with moral agency, &s;ince it is allowed that they will be effectual? Or if tho&s;e means which are barely effectual in hell, be not incon&s;i&s;tent with moral agency, I wi&s;h to have a rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned, why tho&s;e means which would be barely effectual in this life, would be any more incon&s;i&s;tent with moral agency.</P>
<P>Dr. C. and others hold, that to &s;ay, that God cannot con&s;i&s;tently with moral agency, or in a moral way, bring men to repentance in hell, is to limit his power and wi&s;|dom. But to &s;ay, that God cannot, con&s;i&s;tently with moral agency, bring men to repentance in this life, as really implies a limitation of the divine power and wi&s;|dom, as to &s;ay, that he cannot, con&s;i&s;tently with moral agency, bring them to repentance in hell. How is it any more reconcileable with tho&s;e divine perfections, that he cannot reduce a &s;inner to repentance, in three&s;core years and ten, than that he cannot produce the &s;ame effect, throughout eternity? To &s;ay, that there is not time in this life, for the &s;inner to obtain a thorough conviction of the nece&s;&s;ity of repentance, affords no relief to the difficul|ty. For though it &s;hould be granted, that there is not time for the &s;inner to obtain this conviction by experience, which however there &s;eems to be no nece&s;&s;ity of grant|ing; yet cannot God exhibit the truth in &s;uch a manner, as to produce that conviction? And let a rea&s;on be given, why that conviction produced by a clear divine exhibition of truth and a &s;en&s;e of happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, &s;et in &s;uch a light, as to lead to repentance, is more incon&s;i&s;tent with moral agency, than the &s;ame conviction obtained by experience, or by the torments of hell.</P>
<P>If hell-torments be nece&s;&s;ary to lead &s;inners to repent|ance, becau&s;e they are more painful, than the afflictions or other means u&s;ed with men in this life; why are not greater afflictions &s;ent on men in this life? It is manife&s;t, that mo&s;t men might &s;uffer much greater afflictions, than
<PB N="62" REF="022478_0067_0FB935DBB61DAEF8">
they really do &s;uffer. And if greater pain be all that is wanting to lead them to repentance, it &s;eems that to in|flict that, would be the greate&s;t in&s;tance of goodne&s;s, and might &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of hell-torments.</P>
<P>IT is granted by Dr. C. and others, that hell-torments will <HI>certainly</HI> lead to repentance all who &s;uffer them. At the &s;ame time he objects to the idea of leading &s;inners to repentance by the efficacious grace of God, that it de&s;troys moral agency. But if there be a certain e&s;tabli&s;hed, un. failing connection between hell-torments continued for a proper time, and repentance; tho&s;e torments as effec|tually overthrow moral agency, as efficacious grace. All that need be intended in this in&s;tance, by efficacious grace, is &s;uch an exhibition or view of the truth and of motives, as will certainly be attended with repentance. But &s;uch an exhibition of the truth as this, is &s;uppo&s;ed by Dr. C. to be made in hell. And why this exhibition made in hell is more con&s;i&s;tent with moral agency, than an exhibition which is no more effectual, powerful or overbearing, made in this life, I wi&s;h to be informed.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it will be further pleaded, that though it be fea&s;ible to lead &s;inners to repentance in this life; yet it is not wi&s;e and be&s;t. But why is it not as wi&s;e and good, to per&s;uade &s;inners to repent, without the u&s;e of hell-tor|ments, as by tho&s;e torments? If indeed it be fact, that God does not inflict endle&s;s but di&s;ciplinary mi&s;ery on &s;in|ners, we may thence conclude, that it is wi&s;ely &s;o ordered. But this is not to be taken for granted; it ought to be proved before an inference is draw from it. It is the great que&s;tion of this di&s;pute.</P>
<P N="9">9. THAT future puni&s;hment is not merely di&s;ciplinary, appears from the various declarations of &s;cripture, that tho&s;e who die impenitent, are <HI>lo&s;t,</HI> are <HI>ca&s;t away, peri&s;h,</HI> &s;uf|fer <HI>perdition,</HI> are <HI>de&s;troyed,</HI> &s;uffer everla&s;ting <HI>de&s;truction,</HI> &amp;c. as in the&s;e texts; John XVII. 12.

&mdash;But what truth or propriety is there in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, if future pu|ni&s;hment be a mere di&s;cipline? The damned in hell are no more ca&s;t away, lo&s;t, de&s;troyed; they no more peri&s;h, or &s;uffer perdition, than any of God's elect are ca&s;t away, &amp;c. while they are in this world. Hell is no more a place of de&s;truction, than this world. The wicked in hell are no more ve&s;&s;els of wrath fitted to de&s;truction, than the &s;aints are in this world. The damned are under di&s;cipline; &s;o are even the mo&s;t virtuous and holy, while in this life. Yet they are not lo&s;t, ca&s;t away, rejected as reprobate &s;il|ver, or de&s;troyed by God; but are kept as the apple of his eye. And as the means of grace, under which the damned are placed, are far more adapted certainly to &s;ecure and pomote their greate&s;t good, than any means which we enjoy in this &s;tate; to con&s;ider and to &s;peak of them as lo&s;t, ca&s;t away, de&s;troyed, &amp;c. becau&s;e they are under tho&s;e means, is to the highe&s;t degree ab&s;urd. They are ju&s;t as much further removed from a &s;tate, which can ju&s;tly be called de&s;truction, perdition, &amp;c. than they were, while in this world, as the means of grace which they en|joy in hell are more powerful and effectual to prepare them for happine&s;s, than tho&s;e means which they enjoyed in this world.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a man &s;eized with &s;ome dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, and a variety of means is u&s;ed for his recovery, but in vain. Suppo&s;e it appears, that if no more effectual means be employed, he will never be recovered. Suppo&s;e further, that at length an entirely different cour&s;e is taken with him, a cour&s;e which is not only far more likely than the former to be &s;ucce&s;sful; but concerning which there is ab|&s;olute certainty, that it will be &s;ucce&s;sful: I a&s;k, can the man now under the operation of the&s;e mo&s;t excellent and infallible means, with any truth be &s;aid to be <HI>lo&s;t,</HI> to be <HI>ca&s;t away,</HI> to be <HI>de&s;troyed,</HI> &amp;c? Or if tho&s;e terms mu&s;t

be applied to one or other of tho&s;e &s;ituations, in which we have &s;uppo&s;ed him to be at different times; to which of them are they applied with the lea&s;t truth and rea&s;on? This example may illu&s;trate the &s;ubject now under con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="10">10. IF it be con&s;i&s;tent with the divine perfections, to &s;ubject a &s;inner to mi&s;ery, for the &s;ake of advancing <HI>his own</HI> good, as is implied in the very idea of di&s;ciplinary pu|ni&s;hment; why is it not equally con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ame perfections, to &s;ubject a &s;inner to mi&s;ery, for the &s;ake of promoting the good of <HI>the &s;y&s;tem</HI>; provided that mi&s;ery do not exceed the demerit of the &s;ubject?&mdash;I pre&s;ume no believer in endle&s;s puni&s;hment, will plead for any degree or duration of puni&s;hment, which is not &s;ub&s;ervient to the glory of the Deity implying the greate&s;t good of the uni|ver&s;e. Therefore, all &s;uch puni&s;hment, as is not &s;ub&s;er|vient to that end, is foreign to the pre&s;ent que&s;tion. Fur|ther, it is now &s;uppo&s;ed to be proved, that other pu|ni&s;hment than that which is adapted to prepare the &s;in|ner for happine&s;s, is ju&s;tly de&s;erved by the &s;inner. Now &s;ince this it allowed or proved, why is it not con&s;i&s;tent with every attribute of the Deity, to inflict that other pu|ni&s;hment, provided only it be &s;ub&s;ervient to the good of the &s;y&s;tem?</P>
<P>IT is holden by our opponents, that the puni&s;hment of a &s;inner may lead him to repentance. So it may lead other &s;inners to repentance; or it may re&s;train them from &s;in, and in a variety of ways may equally &s;ub&s;erve the good of tho&s;e who are not the &s;ubjects of the puni&s;hment, as it may the good of him who is the &s;ubject of it. And that the good of other per&s;ons may be of equal worth and import|ance, nay, of far greater worth to the &s;y&s;tem, than the good of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or him&s;elf, cannot be denied. Therefore, as I &s;aid in the beginning of this arti|cle, if the per&s;onal good of the &s;inner be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why he &s;hould be puni&s;hed according to ju&s;tice; why is not the good of others, or the good of the &s;y&s;tem, a &s;uf|ficient rea&s;on for the &s;ame proceeding? And is it not evident, not only that &s;uch a puni&s;hment is con&s;i&s;tent with the perfections of God; but that tho&s;e perfections, good|ne&s;s it&s;elf not excepted, require it?

per&s;on puni&s;hed, would be no fruit of goodne&s;s, but of a contrary principle; and the doctrine of merely di&s;cipli|nary puni&s;hment, if it mean a puni&s;hment conducive in|deed to the good of the &s;ubject, but de&s;tructive to the good of the &s;y&s;tem, is &s;o far from being built on the di|vine goodne&s;s, as &s;ome boa&s;t; that it is built on a very different foundation. I am aware, that it is holden by the advocates for univer&s;al &s;alvation, that the good of the &s;y&s;tem cannot be promoted by the endle&s;s mi&s;ery of any individual, but requires the final happine&s;s of every one. Merely to a&s;&s;ert this however, as &s;ome do very confidently, is perfect impertinence. Let them prove it, and they will do &s;omething to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="11">11. IF none of the damned will be puni&s;hed for any other end than their own good, and yet they all de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed more than is &s;ub&s;ervient to their own good; then &s;ome of them de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed for a longer term, than that which in &s;cripture, according to Dr. C's &s;en&s;e of it, is &s;aid to be <HI>forever and ever.</HI> The puni&s;hment, which in the language of &s;cripture, is &s;aid to be <HI>everla&s;ting, for|ever and ever,</HI> &amp;c. will actually be &s;uffered by &s;ome of the damned, as is agreed on all hands. But if none of the damned will &s;uffer any other puni&s;hment than that which is conducive to their per&s;onal good, then the puni&s;hment which in &s;cripture is &s;aid to be forever and ever, is con|ducive to their per&s;onal good. They therefore de&s;erve a puni&s;hment of greater duration than that which in &s;crip|ture is &s;aid to be <HI>forever and ever</HI>: and of cour&s;e that more durable puni&s;hment is the cur&s;e of the divine law, and is threatened in the law. But where in all the law, or in all the &s;cripture, is any puni&s;hment threatened, or even hinted at, of greater duration than that which &s;hall la&s;t <HI>forever and ever?</HI>&mdash;So that this &s;cheme of di&s;ciplinary puni&s;hment nece&s;&s;arily brings us to this ab&s;urdity, that the true and real cur&s;e of the divine law, is not contained in the law; and that the puni&s;hment ju&s;tly de&s;erved by the &s;inner, is no where revealed or even hinted at, in all the &s;cripture. Yet the &s;cripture a&s;&s;ures us, that &s;ome &s;inners will be in fact puni&s;hed according to their demerits, &s;o as to pay the uttermo&s;t farthing, and to receive judgment without mercy. And no man pretends that any &s;inner will &s;uffer more than that puni&s;hment which in &s;cripture is &s;aid to be <HI>forever and ever.</HI> The con&s;equence is, that
<PB N="66" REF="022478_0071_0FB935E344155190">
that puni&s;hment which is <HI>forever and ever,</HI> is the whole that the &s;inner de&s;erves, and therefore is by no means a mere di&s;cipline.</P>
<P N="12">12. OUR Lord informs us, Matt. X. 33; That who&s;o|ever &s;hall deny him before men, &s;hall be denied by him be|fore his Father. But on the hypothe&s;is now under con&s;i|deration, this means only, that Chri&s;t will deny him till he repents. In Luke XIII. 25, &amp;c. we read, that when once the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e &s;hall have ri&s;en and &s;hut the door, &s;ome will begin to &s;tand without and to knock, &s;ay|ing, Lord, Lord, open to us, and will urge &s;everal ar|guments in favour of their admi&s;&s;ion: to whom the ma&s;|ter will an&s;wer, I know you not, whence you are; de|part from me, all ye workers of iniquity. But on the pre&s;ent hypothe&s;is, Chri&s;t will deny them in no other &s;en&s;e than he denies every real penitent and believer, during the pre&s;ent life. He will deny the wicked after the general judgment no longer than till they &s;hall have been &s;ufficiently di&s;ciplined; after that, he will know them, will own them, and receive them to eternal and bli&s;sful communion with him&s;elf. The &s;ame is ob&s;ervable of all his mo&s;t &s;in|cere di&s;ciples in this life. While here, they are under di&s;cipline, though not &s;o merciful and gracious a di&s;cipline as that with which the damned are favoured. However, during the continuance of the di&s;cipline of this life, Chri&s;t denies and refu&s;es to confer on any of his di&s;ciples, an en|tire exemption from pain, di&s;tre&s;s, or affliction; and &s;ub|jects them equally with the re&s;t of the world, to the&s;e ca|lamities: &s;o that in this re&s;pect all things come alike to all. He does indeed give them a&s;&s;urance of re&s;t and glory after this life. As full a&s;&s;urance of re&s;t and glory after the ex|piration of the term of their di&s;cipline, is, on the pre&s;ent hypothe&s;is, given to all the damned. Al&s;o in the pro&s;pect of this re&s;t and glory, and in the certain knowledge that they are the objects of his favour, he affords his di&s;ciples much relief and comfort under their pre&s;ent trials. The &s;ame &s;ources of relief and comfort are afforded to all the damned. So that Chri&s;t denies the damned in no other &s;en&s;e, than that in which he denies his mo&s;t &s;incere fol|lowers, during this life.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame ob&s;ervations for &s;ub&s;tance may be made con|cerning the application of the damned for admi&s;&s;ion into heaven, after the general judgment, and the an&s;wer and
<PB N="67" REF="022478_0072_0FB935E609C44A38">
treatment which they &s;hall receive on that occa&s;ion. The door &s;hall be &s;hut again&s;t them no longer than till they &s;hall have been &s;ufficiently di&s;ciplined. The &s;ame is true of every real chri&s;tian in this life.&mdash;The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e will an&s;wer, <HI>I know you not, (i. e.)</HI> I do not as yet own you as my friends and di&s;ciples, becau&s;e you have not yet been &s;ufficiently di&s;ciplined. The &s;ame is true of every real chri&s;tian in this life.&mdash;He will tell them,
<Q>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.</Q>
But this means no more, than that they mu&s;t not be admitted but hea|ven, till they &s;hall have been &s;ufficiently di&s;ciplined&punc; The &s;ame is true of all real chri&s;tians in this life.</P>
<P N="13">13. ON the hypothe&s;is now under con&s;ideration, what damnation do tho&s;e in hell &s;uffer, more than real chri&s;|tians &s;uffer in this life? They are kept in a &s;tate of mo&s;t merciful and gracious di&s;cipline, till they are prepared, and then they are taken to heaven. The &s;ame is true of every real chri&s;tian in this life. This difference however is worthy of notice, that the di&s;cipline of hell is far more advantageous than that of this life, becau&s;e more effectual, and likely to fit the &s;ubject for heaven more &s;peedily and thoroughly; otherwi&s;e it would never have been applied. It is al&s;o a more merciful and gracious exhibiton of the di|vine goodne&s;s. Doubtle&s;s that mean of grace, which is mo&s;t happily and effectually conducive to the &s;peedy re|pentance and preparation of the &s;inner for heaven, is to him the mo&s;t merciful and gracious exhibition and demon|&s;tration of the divine goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is true, the di&s;cipline of hell is attended with more pain than that of this life. So the di&s;cipline of this life, with re&s;pect to &s;ome individuals, is attended with more pain, than it is with re&s;pect to others. Yet it doth not hence follow, that &s;ome chri&s;tians &s;uffer damnation in this life: nor will it be pretended, that either the &s;criptures or common &s;en&s;e would ju&s;tify the calling of tho&s;e greater pains of &s;ome chi&s;tians in this life, by the name of damna|tion, in any other &s;en&s;e, than the le&s;s pains or afflictions of other chri&s;tians, may be called by the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>ON the whole then, when the &s;cripture &s;ays,
<Q>He that believeth, and is baptized &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned:</Q>
The whole meaning is, he that believeth, &s;hall be admitted to heaven immediately after death: but he that believeth not, &s;hall not immedi|ately
<PB N="68" REF="022478_0073_0FB935E7AD38D010">
be admitted, merely becau&s;e he is not yet prepared for it by repentance; but he &s;hall be put under a di&s;cipline ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary for his own good, and the mo&s;t wi&s;e, effectual, merciful and gracious, that divine wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s can devi&s;e; and as &s;oon as this di&s;cipline &s;hall have prepared him for heaven, he &s;hall be admitted without further delay. When the &s;criptures &s;ay, he that believeth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him; the meaning is, he &s;hall not &s;ee life till he is brought to repentance by the merciful di&s;cipline ju&s;t now mentioned; and not the <HI>wrath</HI> of God abideth on him; becau&s;e he &s;hall be made the &s;ubject of nothing wrathful or vindictive; but the <HI>mercy,</HI> or mo&s;t merciful and benevolent di&s;cipline of God abideth on him.</P>
<P N="14">14. IF the only end of future puni&s;hment be the repen|tance of the &s;inner, and if the means u&s;ed with &s;inners in hell be &s;o much more powerful and happily adapted to the end, than tho&s;e u&s;ed in this life; it is unaccountable, that while &s;o many are led to repentance by the compara|tively weak means u&s;ed with men in this life, and within &s;o &s;hort a period as &s;eventy years, the far more powerful means applied in hell, &s;hould not be productive of the &s;ame effect, in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, within &s;o long a period as a thou&s;and years. That none are to be delivered out of hell, within a thou&s;and years after the general judg|ment, is explicitly taught by Dr. C. His words are,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"></NOTE> "This period" (a thou&s;and years)
<Q>mu&s;t run out, be|fore the wicked dead could <HI>any</HI> of them live as kings and prie&s;ts with Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>WE all doubtle&s;s believe, that many &s;inners die impe|nitent, who are not the &s;ubjects of depravity and hardne&s;s of heart va&s;tly greater, than are in &s;ome, who are brought to repentance in this life. Now put the ca&s;e of the cla&s;s of &s;inners, who are the &s;ubjects of a depravity and hardne&s;s of heart, the very next in degree to that of the mo&s;t depraved of tho&s;e who are brought to repent|ance in this life. Is it rea&s;onable to believe, that the&s;e cannot be brought to repentance, even by the mo&s;t pow|erful means of grace enjoyed in hell, within a le&s;s time than a thou&s;and years? If it be not rea&s;onable to believe this, then it is not rea&s;onable to believe Dr. C's &s;cheme of di&s;ciplinary puni&s;hment.</P>

<P N="16">16. THE &s;cripture, &s;o far from declaring tho&s;e who &s;uf|fer cha&s;ti&s;ement and di&s;ciplinary pains, <HI>accur&s;ed,</HI> merely on that account, expre&s;&s;ly declares them <HI>ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> P&s;al. XCIV. 12;

But where are the damned ever &s;aid to be ble&s;&s;ed? They are con&s;tantly declared to be accur&s;ed.&mdash;Heb. XII. 5&mdash;9,
<Q>Ye have forgotten the exhortation, which &s;peaketh to you, as unto children, my &s;on, de&s;pi&s;e not thou the cha&s;tening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebu|buked of him. For whom the Lord loveth, he cha&s;|teneth, and &s;courgeth every &s;on whom he re|ceiveth. If ye endure cha&s;tening, God dealeth with you as with &s;ons. For what &s;on is he, whom the Father cha&s;teneth not? But if ye be without cha&s;ti&s;e|ment, whereof all are partakers, then are ye ba&s;tards and not &s;ons.</Q>
&mdash;This pa&s;&s;age evidently con&s;iders tho&s;e who &s;uffer cha&s;ti&s;ement from the hand of God, as his children, his &s;ons. If therefore the damned &s;uffer a mere cha&s;ti&s;ement, they are not accur&s;ed, but are the ble&s;&s;ed &s;ons or children of God. But are they ever &s;o called in &s;cripture?&mdash;Be&s;ide; this pa&s;&s;age evidently &s;uppo|&s;es, that &s;ome men do not &s;uffer fatherly cha&s;ti&s;ement, of which all the &s;ons or children of God are partakers: and expre&s;&s;ly declares, that &s;uch as do not &s;uffer it are ba&s;tards and not &s;ons: which &s;eems not to agree with the idea, that all the damned, will by fatherly cha&s;ti&s;ement be brought to final &s;alvation. If no other puni&s;hment be inflicted by God, than fatherly cha&s;ti&s;ement, then there
<PB N="70" REF="022478_0075_0FB935EC3A0C5618">

&amp;c. But if all who die impenitent, be &s;ent to a &s;tate of di&s;cipline mo&s;t excellently adapted to their good and &s;alvation, no man dies without mercy. This di&s;|cipline it&s;elf is the greate&s;t mercy which can, in their &s;tate of mind, be be&s;towed upon them. With re&s;pect to the &s;ame &s;ubject, it is &s;aid, Heb. II. 2;
<Q>That every tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion and di&s;obedience, received <HI>a ju&s;t recompence</HI> of reward.</Q>
&mdash;<HI>A ju&s;t recompence,</HI> is a puni&s;hment ade|quate to the demands of ju&s;tice; and this, as we have &s;een in the preceding chapter, cannot be a mere merciful di&s;cipline.</P>

The con&s;titution therefore by which &s;alvation can be obtained in no other way, than in con&s;equence and on account of his obedience and death, is not only con&s;i&s;tent with wi&s;|dom, holine&s;s, ju&s;tice, yea, all the divine perfections, and the authority of the divine law and government: but it was <HI>required by them all.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the &s;ufferings and death of Chri&s;t, or his atone|ment, is no di&s;cipline of the &s;inner. They are as foreign from it as the vindictive puni&s;hment of the &s;inner him&s;elf. The atonement, as Dr. C. hath explained it, makes way for the wi&s;e, ju&s;t and holy exerci&s;e of mercy toward the &s;inner. It was therefore de&s;igned to <HI>&s;atisfy</HI> the divine <HI>wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>holine&s;s.</HI> It was de&s;igned to make the grant of life to the &s;inner <HI>con&s;i&s;tent with the honour of the divine perfections,</HI> and <HI>the authority of the divine law and go|vernment.</HI> And if our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t might, in the behalf of the &s;inner, be made to &s;uffer in order to <HI>&s;atisfy</HI> divine <HI>ju&s;tice</HI>; why may not the &s;inner him&s;elf be made to &s;uffer for the &s;ame end?</P>
<P>IF Chri&s;t have, on the behalf of &s;inners, &s;uffered for the end of &s;upporting the authority of the divine law and government; what rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why it &s;hould be incon&s;i&s;tent with any attribute of the Deity, that &s;inners them&s;elves &s;hould be made to &s;uffer for the &s;ame end? But this would be a proper vindictive puni&s;hment. Therefore Dr. C. is entirely incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, in allowing the atonement of Chri&s;t, in the terms before quoted; and yet denying the rea&s;onablene&s;s of a vindictive puni&s;hment, or its con&s;i&s;tency with the divine perfections.</P>

IF the meaning of this objection be, that God may inflict vengeance, provided he do it with a &s;ole view to the good of the &s;inner, it confutes it&s;elf; it &s;eems to grant &s;omething, but in reality it grants nothing. It &s;eems to admit a proper vindictive puni&s;hment, but really admits no puni&s;hment be&s;ides that which is merely di&s;ciplinary. For to talk of inflicting vengeance with a &s;ole view to the good of the &s;ubject, can mean nothing more, than to inflict <HI>pain</HI> with a &s;ole view to the good of the &s;ubject; and this is nothing more than a puni&s;hment merely di&s;ciplinary: if God &s;how di&s;plea&s;ure with a &s;ole view to the good of the &s;inner, this is mere di&s;cipline.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF the meaning of this objection be, that God may con&s;i&s;tently with his perfections, inflict a proper vindictive puni&s;hment, provided at the &s;ame time that he is aiming at a proper vindication of his broken law and de&s;pi&s;ed go|vernment, he aim at the good of the &s;inner al&s;o; I an|&s;wer, if it be right and con&s;i&s;tent with the perfections of God, to vindicate his law and government, there is no ne|ce&s;&s;ity of bringing in the aid of another motive or de&s;ign, to make it right or con&s;i&s;tent with his perfections. If on the other hand, it be not in it&s;elf right to vindicate his law and government, no other affections, views or actions,
<PB N="74" REF="022478_0079_0FB935F30C87AC10">
however right and benevolent, co-exi&s;ting with the &s;up|po&s;ed vindication, can atone for it, or make it right.</P>
<P>TO illu&s;trate this by an example:&mdash;A parent has a di&s;|obedient child; and it is become nece&s;&s;ary both for the good of the child, and for the &s;upport of the parent's au|thority in his family in general, and over his child in par|ticular, that he be properly puni&s;hed. Accordingly from both the&s;e motives, the good of the child and the &s;upport of his own authority, the parent inflicts the proper puni&s;h|ment. This according to the objection now before us, is right. But according to the &s;ame objection, if the child be de&s;perate and there be no pro&s;pect of effecting his good by puni&s;hment, it is not con&s;i&s;tent with the character of a good parent to inflict the &s;ame puni&s;hment, from the mo|tives of &s;upporting his own government and the good of the family only. If this action done from the&s;e motives only, be a wrong action, it is &s;till wrong, &s;o far as it pro|ceeds from the &s;ame motives, however it may ari&s;e in part from the motive of the child's good. To render this &s;till plainer, let us &s;uppo&s;e, that a parent inflicts pain on his child merely to afford amu&s;ement to his neighbours, as the Romans were wont to exhibit fights of gladiators. It will be agreed on all hands, that this action is abomina|ble. Again, &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame pain be inflicted partly from the motive of amu&s;ing his neighbours, and partly from a regard to the child's good. I pre&s;ume all will allow, that &s;o far as the action proceeds from the former motive, it is &s;till abominable, and is not &s;anctified by the co-exi&s;t|ent motive of the child's good.</P>
<P>ON the whole, we arrive at this conclu&s;ion; that if it be con&s;i&s;tent with the divine perfections, that God &s;hould inflict puni&s;hment from the two motives of vindicating his own law and government and benefiting the &s;inner; it is equally con&s;i&s;tent with the divine perfections to inflict pun|i&s;hment from the former motive only. All the vindictive puni&s;hment pleaded for, is that which is de&s;erved by the &s;inner and is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the divine law and mo|ral government in proper dignity, and thus to promote the general good: and this &s;urely is oppo&s;ed to no attribute of God, whether ju&s;tice or goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Objection 2. TO the argument drawn from the de&s;|truction threatened to the wicked, it may be objected, that this de&s;truction means, that they &s;hall be de&s;troyed <HI>as &s;in|ners</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="022478_0080_0FB935F48F7E00E0">
only, or &s;hall be brought to repentance and a renun|ciation of &s;in. To this it may be an&s;wered, that in this &s;en&s;e every one who in this life repents and believes, is de&s;troyed, and &s;uffers de&s;truction. Yet this is never &s;aid in &s;cripture. This &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>de&s;truction</HI> makes the puni&s;hment of hell, and the awful cur&s;e of the divine law, to con&s;i&s;t in <HI>repentance,</HI> which is no puni&s;hment or cur&s;e, but an ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing. Be&s;ides, that repent|ance, on which the &s;inner is forgiven if it can be called a <HI>de&s;truction</HI> at all, is not an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> de&s;truction, but an emotion of heart, which is begun and fini&s;hed in a ve|ry &s;hort time. Or if by this everla&s;ting de&s;truction be under&s;tood the habitual and per&s;evering repentance of the true convert; then the glorified &s;aints in heaven, are con&s;tantly &s;uffering that <HI>de&s;truction</HI> which will be everla&s;t|ing, and which is the cur&s;e of the divine law.</P>
<P>BEFORE this &s;ubject is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, proper notice ought to be taken of &s;ome arguments urged in favour of the &s;en|timent, that the puni&s;hment of hell is merely di&s;cip|plinary.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is urged,<NOTE PLACE="foot">Page 324, 325.</NOTE> that the various afflictions of <HI>this life</HI> are de&s;igned for the good of the patients: therefore pro|bably the &s;ame end is de&s;igned by the &s;ufferings of hell. &mdash;To this it may be an&s;wered, It is by no means granted, that all the afflictions of this life are de&s;igned for the good of the patients. It does not appear, that men in general, who are vi&s;ited with the lo&s;s of children, wives, or other dear friends; or with the lo&s;s of eye|&s;ight, of &s;ome other &s;en&s;e, or of a limb; or with di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing pains or incurable di&s;ea&s;es; are thereby rendered more happy in this life. If men may be allowed to judge by their own experience, they will in mo&s;t ca&s;es decide the que&s;tion in the negative. Nor does the deci|&s;ion in many ca&s;es appear ill founded to tho&s;e, who have opportunity to ob&s;erve per&s;ons under tho&s;e afflictions. To &s;ay that men are no proper judges, whether they them&s;elves be, in this life, made more happy or not, by the afflictions which they &s;uffer, is to &s;ay, that they are no judges of their own happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. This being once e&s;tabli&s;hed, we may a&s;&s;ert, that hell-torments though endle&s;s promote the happine&s;s of the patients: becau&s;e being no judges of their own happine&s;s or mi&s;ery
<PB N="76" REF="022478_0081_0FB935F5F14301F8">
they may be extremely happy, at the very time they judge them&s;elves to be perfectly mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>IN any ea&s;e in which calamity proves fatal, it is ab&s;urd to pretend, that it promotes, in this life, the happine&s;s of the patient, unle&s;s calamity it&s;elf be happine&s;s. No man has opportunity in this life to derive any good from the pains of death. Therefore at lea&s;t the&s;e pains are not de&s;igned for the &s;ubject's good during his pre&s;ent life.</P>
<P>HERE it may be proper to mention &s;everal remarkable in|&s;tances of grievous calamity recorded in &s;cripture: As the in&s;tance of the old world, of Sodom and Gomorrah, of Pharaoh, Saul, the hou&s;e of Eli, Nadab and Abihu, Hiel, &amp;c. It is pre&s;umed, Dr. C, him&s;elf would not pretend, that the&s;e calamities were intended for "the profit of the &s;ufferers them&s;elves" in this life. What right then had he to argue, as in the following pa&s;&s;age?<NOTE PLACE="foot">Page 324, 325, &amp;c.</NOTE>
<Q>The pro|per tendency and final cau&s;e of evils in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, are to do us good. This is the voice of rea&s;on confir|med by experience, and &s;cripture concurs herewith.</Q>
He then quotes P&s;al. LXXXIX. 31&mdash;34; and proceeds,
<Q>If evil, puni&s;hment or mi&s;ery in the pre&s;ent life is mer|cifully intended for the good of the patients them&s;elves why not in the next life? Is the character of God, as the father of mercies, and God of pity, confined to this world only?</Q>
The force of all this depends en|tirely on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that in all in&s;tances of &s;uffering in this life, the end is the &s;ufferer's good during this life.</P>
<P>BUT this &s;uppo&s;ition, we &s;ee by what has been &s;aid al|ready, is by no means true. The &s;uper&s;tructure there|fore built on this foundation falls entirely to the ground. We all grant, that in &s;ome in&s;tances afflictions are in|tended for the good of the &s;ufferers. A proof of this, which needed no proof&punc; Dr. C. has produced out of the eighty-ninth p&s;alm. On this foundation extended in his own imagination to comprehend all in&s;tances of affliction, he built an argument in which he triumphed.&mdash;Now &s;ince there are tho&s;e &s;everal in&s;tances of calamity before mentioned, which Dr. C. would not pretend were de&s;ign|ed for the &s;ufferer's good in this life; I might as well &s;up|po&s;e that no other in&s;tances of calamity are de&s;igned for the &s;ufferers good in this life; and then adopt Dr. C's
<PB N="77" REF="022478_0082_0FB935F76D6133E8">
&s;train of <HI>ardent declamation,</HI> in manner following: If evil puni&s;hment or mi&s;ery in the pre&s;ent life, be not intended for the good of the patients them&s;elves, but to &s;upport the authority of the divine law, and thus &s;ub&s;erve the ge|neral good; why not in the next life? Is the character of God, as a God of perfect purity and &s;trict ju&s;tice, limited to this world only? Why &s;hould it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the infinitely holy God has the &s;ame hatred of &s;in in the other world which he has in this? and that he has in the next &s;tate the &s;ame intention which he has in this, to vin|dicate, by puni&s;hments, his law and government.</P>
<P>THE truth is, that as &s;ome of the calamities of this life are intended for the patient's good in this life and others are as manife&s;tly not intended for his good in this life; nothing certain can be hence concluded concerning the end of the mi&s;ery of the damned. Nay: if it were cer|tain, that all the calamities of this life are intended for the patient's good in this life or that they are not intended for his good in this life; yet it could not be certainly thence concluded, that the mi&s;eries of the damned are intended for the good of the patients, nor that they are not in|tended for the good of the patients. But this point mu&s;t be determined by other evidence, the evidence of reve|lation.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be &s;aid, that though &s;ome of the &s;ufferings of this life do not, in this life, produce good to the pa|tients; yet they will produce good to them in the future life; it will be &s;ufficient to reply, that this wants proof; that it is a main point in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute; and that it &s;hould be taken for granted, is not to be &s;uffered.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is al&s;o urged by our author,
<Q>That the whole cour&s;e of nature, and even the revelations of &s;cripture con&s;tantly &s;peak of God, as the univer&s;al father, as well as governor of men&mdash;What now is the temper and conduct of fathers on earth towards their offspring? They readily do them good and cha&s;ti&s;e them for their profit; but they do not puni&s;h their children, having no view to their advantage.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>And &s;hall we &s;ay that of our father in heaven, which we cannot &s;up|po&s;e of any father on earth, till we have fir&s;t dive&s;ted him of the heart of a father?</Q>
He abounds in pathetic di&s;cour&s;e of the &s;ame &s;train, which is much more &s;uited to work on the imaginations and pa&s;&s;ions of mankind, than on
<PB N="78" REF="022478_0083_0FB935F9AECC4150">
their rea&s;on. The foundation of all this di&s;cour&s;e is, that fa|thers on earth, acting in character, never puni&s;h and never can puni&s;h their children, but with a de&s;ign to promote their per&s;onal good. But would Dr. C. him&s;elf adven|ture to lay down this po&s;ition, and to abide by it? Did never a wi&s;e and good father find it nece&s;&s;ary, to puni&s;h, and even to ca&s;t out of his family, a de&s;perate child, to prevent his ruining the re&s;t of the children? Was there never, or can there po&s;&s;ibly never be, an in&s;tance of this? If &s;uch an in&s;tance ever has, or ever may occur, the ap|pearance of argument in the forecited pa&s;&s;age, vani&s;hes at once. Not only do <HI>fathers</HI> find it nece&s;&s;ary to puni&s;h de&s;|perate children, without any pro&s;pect of their per&s;onal good; but very frequently do <HI>kings,</HI> governors and chief magi&s;trates find this nece&s;&s;ary with regard to their &s;ubjects. Now in the &s;cripture, God much oftener illu&s;trates his character, by that of a king, a prince, a &s;overeign lord, than by that of a father. And askings, &amp;c. often find it nece&s;&s;ary to inflict capital and other puni&s;hments, without any view to the per&s;onal good of the &s;ufferers; we may hence deduce an argument, that God al&s;o will puni&s;h many of his rebellious &s;ubjects, without any view to their per|&s;onal good; but to &s;upport his moral government, to be an example of terror to others, and thus to &s;ecure the general good: and this argument would be at lea&s;t as &s;trong as that of Dr. C. ju&s;t cited.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT may be pleaded, that though calamities in this life do not always i&s;&s;ue in the &s;ufferers good; yet God may compen&s;ate them in the future &s;tate, for the lo&s;s or &s;uffering, of which they are the &s;ubjects in this life. Thus our author,
<Q>It is po&s;&s;ible that the evils which a|ny &s;uffer in this, may be made up to them in another &s;tate.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Benevolence of the Deity, p. 249.</NOTE>&mdash;It is granted, that God is able to com|pen&s;ate his creatures for the evils of this life; but that he in fact will do it in all ca&s;es, is to be proved.&mdash;Be|&s;ides; the very idea of compen&s;ation is incon&s;i&s;tent with the idea of di&s;ciplinary puni&s;hment and that all the evils of both this life and the future are nece&s;&s;ary and are in|tended for the good of tho&s;e who &s;uffer them. For if this idea be ju&s;t, what foundation is there for compen&s;a|tion? Will a father compen&s;ate a child for the pain of that di&s;cipline which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for his good
<PB N="79" REF="022478_0084_0FB9360160F3D638">
and mo&s;t wi&s;ely adapted to it? No man would ever think of it. Compen&s;ation &s;uppo&s;es, that the evil for which compen&s;ation is made, has been inflicted from other mo|tives, than a regard to the good of the &s;ufferer. And if evil may in one in&s;tance be inflicted from other motives than a regard to the good of the &s;ufferer; it may in any other in&s;tance in which ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom admit of it; and if in this &s;tate, in the future too.&mdash;If the evils of life be intended for the good only of the &s;ubjects, we may as well talk of compen&s;ating a man for the pain of draw|ing a tooth which is a perpetual torment to him; or for the di&s;agreeable ta&s;te of the do&s;e which cures him of the colic; as to talk of compen&s;ating him for the calami|ties of life. The &s;aints will indeed be rewarded for their pa|tience under the&s;e calamities; and this part of their ho|line&s;s is doubtle&s;s as amiable, and is as properly as any part of their holine&s;s the object of the complacency of the Deity, and of tho&s;e rewards which are the fruits of that complacency. But tho&s;e rewards are not to be con&s;idered as compen&s;ations of lo&s;&s;es or of damages. The very idea of compen&s;ation implies, that that for which compen&s;ation is made, is on the whole an evil to the per&s;on compen&s;a|ted. But the very idea that pre&s;ent evils are nece&s;&s;ary and conducive to the good of the &s;ubjects, implies, that on the whole they are no evils to the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>IT is now &s;ubmitted to the reader, whether the doctrine, that the damned will in fact &s;uffer no other puni&s;hment, than that which is &s;ub&s;ervient to their per&s;onal good, be not in many re&s;pects mo&s;t glaringly incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;criptures; and whether it be not equally irreconcileable with their general tenor as with many particular pa&s;&s;ages; and al&s;o with many parts of Dr. C's book.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Containing an examination of Dr. C's arguments to prove endle&s;s puni&s;hment incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the damned is incon|&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, is po&s;itively and abundantly a&s;|&s;erted by Dr. C. and other advocates for univer&s;al &s;al|vation. Whether the arguments which the Doctor offers to prove the inju&s;tice of endle&s;s puni&s;hment, be conclu&s;ive, is the &s;ubject of our inquiry in this chapter.</P>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to this inquiry, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, to explain the meaning of the propo&s;ition&mdash;That the end|le&s;s puni&s;hment of the damned is con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>I DO not find that Dr. C. hath any where given us a de|finition of his idea of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> or of a ju&s;t puni&s;hment, which is certainly a great omi&s;&s;ion. The Chevalier <HI>Ram&s;ay</HI> gives the following definition of the divine ju&s;tice: "Ju&s;tice is that perfection of God, by which he endeavours continual|ly to make all intelligences ju&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Principles, Vol. I. p. 432.</NOTE>" But with the &s;ame rea|&s;on he might have defined the divine mercy to be, not that perfection in God, by which he is him&s;elf inclined to the exerci&s;e of mercy to the mi&s;erable; but that by which he endeavours to make all intelligences merciful: and the di|vine love to be, not that perfection in God, by which he loves his creatures, but that by which he endeavours to make other intelligences exerci&s;e love. By this definition of ju&s;tice a human judge, who wrongs every man, who&s;e cau&s;e is brought before him, and yet endeavours to make other men ju&s;t, is a ju&s;t judge.</P>
<P>THE word <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> is u&s;ed in three different &s;en&s;es. Some|times it means <HI>commutative</HI> ju&s;tice, &s;ometimes <HI>di&s;tributive,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>general</HI> or <HI>public</HI> ju&s;tice. Commutative ju&s;|tice re&s;pects property only, and the equal exchange and re|&s;titution of it. <HI>Di&s;tributive</HI> ju&s;tice is the equal di&s;tribution of rewards and puni&s;hments, and it re&s;pects the <HI>per&s;onal</HI> rights and demerit of the per&s;on rewarded or puni&s;hed. <HI>General</HI> or <HI>public</HI> ju&s;tice re&s;pects what are called the rights of a community, whether a city, &s;tate, empire, or the uni|ver&s;e. This kind of ju&s;tice requires the public good; and
<PB N="81" REF="022478_0086_0FB93604ED677578">
whenever that I violated or neglected the public is <HI>injured.</HI> This la&s;t u&s;e of the word ju&s;tice, though very frequent, yet is an improper u&s;e of it; becau&s;e to practi&s;e ju&s;tice in this &s;en&s;e, is no other than to act from public &s;pirit, or from love to the community, and with re&s;pect to the univer&s;e, it is the very &s;ame with general benevolence.</P>
<P>NOW when we inquire, whether the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the wicked be con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, no man will &s;up|po&s;e that the word ju&s;tice means <HI>commutative</HI> ju&s;tice; be|cau&s;e the inquiry has no re&s;pect to <HI>property.</HI> Nor is the word to be under&s;tood to mean <HI>general</HI> or <HI>public</HI> ju&s;tice. It is indeed an important inquiry, whether the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of a man dying in impenitence, be con&s;i&s;tent with the general intere&s;t of the univer&s;e; but this is not the &s;ubject to be con&s;idered in this chapter. The que&s;tion to be con&s;idered in this and in one or two &s;ucceding chap|ters, is, whether to inflict an endle&s;s puni&s;hment on a man dy|ing in impenitence, be an act of <HI>di&s;tributive</HI> ju&s;tice, or be a treat|ment of him by his judge, corre&s;pondent and no more than corre&s;pondent or proportioned to his demerit, to his crimes, or to his moral conduct and per&s;onal character. This is a que&s;tion entirely different from the following; Whether the infliction of an endle&s;s puni&s;hment on a &s;in|ner dying in impenitence, be &s;ub&s;ervient to the good of the univer&s;e? A puni&s;hment or calamity inflicted on a per&s;on may be &s;ub&s;ervient to the public good of a community, yet not be de&s;erved by him on account of his per&s;onal crimes. It was for the good of the Roman republic, that <HI>Regulus</HI> &s;hould return to certain death at Carthage; yet he did not de&s;erve that death; it was not corre&s;pondent to his moral character. On the other hand, many a villain has by his attrocious crimes de&s;erved death; yet by rea&s;on of his power, his connections, or the peculiar circum&s;tances of the &s;tate, it could not, con&s;i&s;tently with the public good be inflicted on him. So that in a variety of in&s;tances public ju&s;tice or the public good is promoted by private or di&s;tributive inju&s;tice; and di&s;tributive ju&s;tice would be productive of public injury or damage. And in &s;ome ca&s;es the public good may be promoted by a proceed|ing, which, though not in the di&s;tributive &s;en&s;e unju&s;t, yet is not according to di&s;tributive ju&s;tice. An innocent per&s;on may choo&s;e to be made the &s;ubject of &s;ufferings, in the &s;tead of a criminal. Therefore though the &s;uffer|ings
<PB N="82" REF="022478_0087_0FB9360671AC1850">
which he choo&s;es to endure, be inflicted on him, no inju&s;tice is done him. For will it be p<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ended, that this proceeding is according to &s;trict di&s;tributive ju&s;tice, which requires the criminal to be puni&s;hed and not his &s;ub&s;titute. Yet it may promote the good of the community, or &s;ecure it from great detriment by a relaxation of its laws and go|vernment; as in the well known in&s;tance of Zaleucus, who put out one of his own eyes, to &s;upport the authority of the law again&s;t adultery, which his own &s;on had vio|lated.</P>
<P>ON the whole, when we inquire whether the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the damned be con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, the word <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> means <HI>di&s;tributive</HI> ju&s;tice. This, as has been already ob&s;erved, re&s;pects the per&s;onal merit or demerit of the man rewarded or puni&s;hed. A man &s;uffers di&s;tri|butive inju&s;tice when he is not treated as favourably as is corre&s;pondent to his per&s;onal conduct or character. On the other hand, he has ju&s;tice done him, when he is treat|ed in a manner corre&s;pondent to his per&s;onal conduct or character. A ju&s;t puni&s;hment then is that which is pro|portioned or corre&s;pondent to the crime puni&s;hed. But it may be further inquired, when is a puni&s;hment propor|tioned to the crime puni&s;hed? To this the an&s;wer &s;eems to be, when by the pain or natural evil of the puni&s;hment, it exhibits a ju&s;t idea of the moral evil or ruinous tendency of the crime, and a proper motive to re&s;train all intel|ligent beings from the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime.</P>
<P>FURTHER to elucidate this matter, let it be ob&s;erved, that any crime, by relaxing the laws and by weakening the government, is a damage to the community; and de|&s;erves ju&s;t &s;o much puni&s;hment, as, by re&s;toring the pro|per tone of the laws, and proper &s;trength to the govern|ment, will repair that damage. The chief evil of any crime, on account of which it principally de&s;erves puni&s;h|ment, con&s;i&s;ts in the relaxation of the laws and govern|ment of the community in which the crime is committed. For example, the chief evil of theft is not that a certain per&s;on is clande&s;tinely deprived of his property. His pro|perty may be re&s;tored and he may in this re&s;pect &s;uffer no damage. Still the thief de&s;erves puni&s;hment. If a man be defamed, the chief evil is not that the per&s;on defamed is injured by the lo&s;s of his reputation. His reputation may, by a full confe&s;&s;ion of the defamer or by other means,
<PB N="83" REF="022478_0088_0FB93607EACC5838">
be re&s;tored. Still the defamer may de&s;erve puni&s;hment. If a man be murdered, the chief evil is not that the man is deprived of his life, and his friends and the community are deprived of the benefit of his aid. His life may have been a burden to him&s;elf, to his friends and to the com|munity; or he may by divine power be rai&s;ed from the dead. Still, in either ca&s;e, the murderer would de&s;erve puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>THE true rea&s;on, why all tho&s;e criminals would, in all tho&s;e ca&s;es, de&s;erve puni&s;hment, is, that by their re&s;pec|tive crimes they would weaken the laws and government of the community, thereby would break in upon the pub|lic peace, good order, &s;afety and happine&s;s; in&s;tead of the&s;e would introduce confu&s;ion and ruin; and thus would do a very great damage to the community.&mdash;Therefore, they would re&s;pectively de&s;erve ju&s;t &s;o much puni&s;hment, as by re&s;toring the tone of the laws and government, would re-e&s;tabli&s;h the peace, good order, &s;afety and hap|pine&s;s of the community, and thus would repair the da|mage done to the community by their crimes.&mdash;A puni&s;h|ment adequate to this end exhibits by the natural evil of it, a ju&s;t idea of the moral evil of the crime, and a pro|per motive to re&s;train all from the commi&s;&s;ion of it: it is therefore duly proportioned to the crime, is corre&s;pon|dent to the conduct of the criminal, and is perfectly ju&s;t.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ages in which Dr. C. <HI>declares po&s;itively,</HI> that the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the wicked would be unju&s;t, are very numerous; but his arguments to prove that it would be unju&s;t, are, &s;o far as I can find, very few. As this is a capital point in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, it was to be ex|pected, that he would go into a formal con&s;ideration of it, and give us his rea&s;ons methodically and distinctly. In|&s;tead of this, in all the various parts of his book in which he declaims mo&s;t vehemently on the &s;ubject, there are very few in which I find an attempt to argue. The&s;e are as follows:&mdash;
<Q>An eternity of mi&s;ery &s;wallows up all proportion: or though there &s;hould be &s;ome difference in the <HI>degree</HI> of pain, it is &s;uch a difference, I fear, as will be &s;carce thought worthy of being brought into the account, when the circum&s;tance of endle&s;s duration is annexed to it.</Q>

<Q>The &s;mallne&s;s of the difference between tho&s;e in this world, to whom the character of

<HI>wicked</HI> belongs in the lowe&s;t &s;en&s;e, and tho&s;e to whom the character of <HI>good</HI> is applicable in the like &s;en&s;e, renders it incredible, that &s;uch an amazingly great dif|ference &s;hould be made between them in the future. The difference between them, according to the com|mon opinion, will be doubly infinite.&mdash;For the re|ward and puni&s;hment being both eternal, they mu&s;t at la&s;t become infinite in magnitude. How to reconcile this with the ab&s;olutely accurate impartiality of God, is, I confe&s;s, beyond me.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 320.</NOTE>&mdash;
<Q>It does not appear to me, that it would be honourable to the infinitely righ|teous and benevolent governor of the world, to make wicked men everla&s;tingly mi&s;erable. For in what point of light &s;oever we take a view of &s;in, it is certainly in its nature a finite evil. It is the fault of a finite crea|ture, and the effect of finite principles, pa&s;&s;ions and ap|petites. To &s;ay therefore, that the &s;inner is doomed to infinite mi&s;ery, for the finite faults of a finite life, looks like a reflection on the infinite ju&s;tice, as well as good|ne&s;s of God. I know it has been often urged, that &s;in is an infinite evil, becau&s;e committed again&s;t an in|finite object; for which rea&s;on an infinite puni&s;hment is no more than its due de&s;ert. But this metaphy&s;ical nicety proves a great deal too much, if it proves any|thing at all. For according to this way of arguing, all &s;inners mu&s;t &s;uffer the utmo&s;t in <HI>degree,</HI> as well as in <HI>duration</HI>; otherwi&s;e they will not &s;uffer &s;o much as they might do, and as they ought to do: which is plainly incon&s;i&s;tent with that difference the &s;cripture often declares there &s;hall be in the puni&s;hment of wicked men, according to the difference there has been in the na|ture and number of their evil deeds.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 361.</NOTE></P>
<P>THESE, I think, are the pa&s;&s;ages in which Dr. C. offers his mo&s;t plau&s;ible and &s;trong, if not his only, arguments, to prove, that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is not con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;|tice; and the arguments here offered are the&s;e three on|ly&mdash;That endle&s;s puni&s;hment implies &s;uch a different treatment of the &s;malle&s;t &s;inners and &s;malle&s;t &s;aints, as is out of all proportion to their re&s;pective characters; it is therefore incredible, and not reconcileable with the ju&s;tice and impartiality of God.&mdash;That endle&s;s puni&s;hment is out of all proportion to the demerit of &s;in, as the latter is
<PB N="85" REF="022478_0090_0FB9360AEB9C3710">
finite, the former infinite.&mdash;That endle&s;s puni&s;hment, on account of the infinite evil of &s;in, as committed again&s;t a God of infinite glory, implies, that future puni&s;hment is in|finite in degree too, and therefore that the puni&s;hment of all the damned is equal.</P>
<P N="1">I. THAT endle&s;s puni&s;hment implies &s;uch a different treatment of the &s;malle&s;t &s;inner and &s;malle&s;t &s;aint, as is out of all proportion to their re&s;pective characters; it is there|fore incredible, and not reconcileable with the ju&s;tice and impartiality of God. On this I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is an infinite difference between the treat|ment of two per&s;ons, one of whom is &s;ent to endle&s;s mi&s;ery, the other not, is readily granted. But that the one, who is &s;ent to &s;uch a puni&s;hment, is treated unju&s;tly, is not granted; and to a&s;&s;ert, that he is treated unju&s;tly, is to <HI>beg</HI> and not to prove the thing in que&s;tion.</P>
<P N="2">2. That of the two per&s;ons now &s;uppo&s;ed, one &s;hould be treated according to his demerits, and the other by the "boundle&s;s goodne&s;s of God," &s;hould be exempted from that puni&s;hment, to which, by his demerit, he is ju&s;tly lia|ble, is nothing incredible or unju&s;t. Surely the gracious exemption of one man from that puni&s;hment, which he de|&s;erves, renders not the puni&s;hment of another unju&s;t, which would otherwi&s;e be ju&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. As there is no inju&s;tice in the ca&s;e now &s;tated, &s;o nei|ther is there any partiality in it. There is no partiality in the conduct of the Supreme Magi&s;trate, who condemns one criminal according to his demerit, and pardons another criminal equally guilty. But partiality is then practi&s;ed, when of two real and known criminals, one is condemned by the judge; the other cleared, on the pretence, that he is innocent. So that this whole argument from the incre|dibly different treatment of the &s;malle&s;t &s;inner and &s;malle&s;t &s;aint, who&s;e characters are &s;o nearly on a level, &s;o far as it &s;uppo&s;es the different treatment to be incredible, on ac|count of the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the &s;inner, is a mere begging of the que&s;tion. It takes for granted, that the &s;inner does not de&s;erve an endle&s;s puni&s;hment. So far as it &s;uppo&s;es the different treatment to be incredible, on ac|count of the infinite reward or happine&s;s be&s;towed on the &s;aint, it &s;uppo&s;es, that God in his infinite goodne&s;s, cannot be&s;tow an infinite good on a creature, who in his own per|&s;on is entirely unworthy of it. It al&s;o &s;uppo&s;es, that if e|ver
<PB N="86" REF="022478_0091_0FB9360C73E2F198">
God pardon any &s;inner, he mu&s;t pardon all, who&s;e de|merits are no more than that of the man pardoned; other|wi&s;e he is partial: and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that if ever he condemn any &s;inner, he mu&s;t condemn all tho&s;e, who&s;e characters are equally &s;inful with that of the man con|demned. But it is pre&s;umed, that the&s;e &s;entiments will be avowed by no man.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE next argument is. That endle&s;s puni&s;hment is out of all proportion to the demerit of &s;in, as the former is infinite, the latter finite.&mdash;As this is a matter of great im|portance in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute, it requires our particular attention.&mdash;How then does Dr. C. make it appear, that &s;in is a finite evil? By the&s;e &s;everal con&s;iderations, that it is the fault of a finite creature,&mdash;during a finite life,&mdash; and the effect of finite principles, pa&s;&s;ions and appetites; the &s;um of which is, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for a creature, in a finite duration, to commit an infinite crime; or which is the &s;ame thing, a crime which &s;hall de&s;erve an endle&s;s puni&s;hment.&mdash;As to this let it be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT if it be impo&s;&s;ible for a creature, in a finite du|ration, to commit a crime which &s;hall de&s;erve an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, it is as really again&s;t what Dr. C. holds, as a|gain&s;t the oppo&s;ite &s;y&s;tem. He &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 11.</NOTE>
<Q>If the next is a &s;tate of puni&s;hment intended to &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of God, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible all men &s;hould be finally &s;aved:</Q>
that is, if in the next &s;tate a puni&s;hment be inflicted, which &s;atisfies ju&s;tice, all men will not be &s;aved. But a puni&s;hment, which &s;atisfies ju&s;tice is a perfectly ju&s;t puni&s;hment. It is therefore ju&s;t, that &s;ome men &s;hould finally not be &s;aved; or it is ju&s;t, that on account of their &s;ins, they be without end excluded from &s;alvation. And what is the endle&s;s ex|clu&s;ion of a &s;inner from &s;alvation on account of his &s;ins, but an endle&s;s puni&s;hment inflicted for the fault of a finite crea|ture, committed in a finite life, and the effect of finite prin|ciples, pa&s;&s;ions and appetites?&mdash;This pa&s;&s;age of Dr. C. is a plain and full conce&s;&s;ion both of the ju&s;tice of endle&s;s, pu|ni&s;hment, and of the infinite evil of &s;in.</P>
<P>THAT &s;in is an infinite evil, or an evil de&s;erving an end|le&s;s puni&s;hment, is implied in all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages al&s;o, in which Dr. C. a&s;&s;erts, that the &s;alvation of all men, and e|ven of the damned, after they have &s;uffered all which they ever are to &s;uffer, is the fruit of <HI>boundle&s;s and inexhau&s;tible
<PB N="87" REF="022478_0092_0FB9360E403757F8">
goodne&s;s, infinite indulgence and love,</HI> &amp;c. In his argument that the puni&s;hment of the damned is di&s;ciplinary, he &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 326.</NOTE>
<Q>That God mu&s;t in the other world, as well as this, be di&s;po&s;ed to <HI>make it evident,</HI> that he is a being of <HI>boundle&s;s</HI> and <HI>inexhau&s;tible</HI> goodne&s;s.</Q>
It is plain by the connecti|on, that the Doctor means, that the deliverance of the damned, in con&s;equence of a puni&s;hment, which is condu|cive to their good, is an act of boundle&s;s and inexhau&s;tible goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>But that the goodne&s;s of that act of deliverance is not greater than the evil or puni&s;hment from which it delivers, will be conceded by all. There is goodne&s;s in delivering a man from the tooth-ache; but no man will pretend, that this is an act of <HI>boundle&s;s</HI> and <HI>inexhau&s;tible</HI> goodne&s;s. To de|liver from the mi&s;ery of a thou&s;and years torment in hell, is an act of far greater goodne&s;s. But this is not an act of <HI>boundle&s;s</HI> and <HI>inexhau&s;tible</HI> goodne&s;s. Nor is any act of de|liverance worthy of the&s;e epithets, unle&s;s it deliver from an evil, which is boundle&s;s and inexhau&s;tible. Doubtle&s;s the act of God in delivering a &s;inner from the puni&s;hment of hell is called an act of boundle&s;s and inexhau&s;tible good|ne&s;s with re&s;pect to the greatne&s;s of the benefit conferred by that deliverance, and not with re&s;pect to the inherent and e&s;&s;ential goodne&s;s of God. If the latter be Doctor C's meaning, what he &s;ays is no illu&s;tration of the divine goodne&s;s in delivering a &s;inner from the pains of hell: he might have &s;aid the &s;ame concerning the deliverance of a|ny per&s;on guilty or innocent, from the tooth-ache, or from the prick of a pin. He &s;ays, that God in the other world, as well as this, mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed <HI>to make it evident,</HI> that he is a being of boundle&s;s and inexhau&s;tible goodne&s;s. But if the deliverance of a &s;inner from the pains of hell be not a boundle&s;s benefit, it does not make it evident, that God is a being of boundle&s;s goodne&s;s. If it be a boundle&s;s be|nefit, the evil delivered from is boundle&s;s. If therefore the deliverance of the damned from the torments of hell, be an act and a proof of boundle&s;s and inexhau&s;tible goodne&s;s, as the Doctor holds, the evil from which they are deliver|ed, and to which they are expo&s;ed by the divine law, is boundle&s;s and inexhau&s;tible. But they are not by the di|vine law expo&s;ed to a greater puni&s;hment than they ju&s;tly de&s;erve: therefore they ju&s;tly de&s;erve a boundle&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> inex|hau&s;tible puni&s;hment: of con&s;equence &s;in, by which they
<PB N="88" REF="022478_0093_0FB9361088779E28">
de&s;erve this puni&s;hment, is a boundle&s;s and inexhau&s;tible or an infinite evil.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Dr. C. in the words of Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton,</HI> &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 405.</NOTE> "Many, or all of them," [the damned]
<Q>may po&s;&s;ibly be re|covered and &s;aved at la&s;t, by the infinite indulgence and love of their creator.</Q>
The &s;ame ob&s;ervations, which were made in the preceding paragraph, are applicable here. It cannot be the meaning of Dr. C. that the recovery of the damned is in no other &s;en&s;e a fruit or proof of the in|finite indulgence and love of their Creator, than the reco|very of a per&s;on in this life from the &s;malle&s;t di&s;ea&s;e, or ca|lamity; or the deliverance of even an innocent being from &s;ome &s;light evil. A le&s;s degree of indulgence and love, than that which is infinite, would be &s;ufficient for the&s;e re|coveries, or deliverances. And if nothing &s;hort of infinite indulgence and love can recover the damned, then their recovery is a proof of infinite love. Now what can be a proof of infinite love, but the be&s;towment of an infinite be|nefit? And no benefit con&s;i&s;ting in recovery from evil is infinite, unle&s;s the evil, from which the recovery is made, be infinite. But if the evil from which the damned are &s;uppo&s;ed to be recovered, be infinite, &s;in, by which they are expo&s;ed to that evil, mu&s;t it&s;elf be an infinite evil.</P>
<P>IF here it &s;hould be objected, that the damned are not indeed <HI>delivered from wrath,</HI> by boundle&s;s goodne&s;s and in|finite love; but that boundle&s;s goodne&s;s and infinite love are exerci&s;ed in their admi&s;&s;ion to the po&s;itive happine&s;s of heaven only: I entreat the reader to ob&s;erve, that in the former of the two pa&s;&s;ages la&s;t quoted, Dr. C. is &s;peaking of God's <HI>making evident</HI> his boundle&s;s and inexhau&s;tible goodne&s;s, by pitying &s;inners, and puni&s;hing them in order to their benefit, or by the <HI>deliverance</HI> of the damned, in con&s;equence of a di&s;ciplinary puni&s;hment. In the other, he is &s;peaking in the words of Mr. Whi&s;ton, concerning the <HI>recovery</HI> of the damned.&mdash;But for a more full an&s;wer I beg leave to refer the reader to page 13, where this &s;ame objection has been &s;tated and con&s;idered.</P>
<P>THAT &s;in is an infinite evil, is implied in what Dr. C. holds concerning annihilation; he &s;ays,
<Q>If the fore|going &s;cheme &s;hould be found to have no truth in it&mdash; the &s;econd death ought to be con&s;idered as that which will put an end to their exi&s;tence both in &s;oul and body,
<PB N="89" REF="022478_0094_0FB93611AEF73D38">
&s;o that they &s;hall be no more in the creation of God.</Q>
By this it appears that the Doctor held, that endle&s;s an|nihilation would be no unju&s;t puni&s;hment of &s;in. But end|le&s;s annihilation is an <HI>endle&s;s</HI> or <HI>infinite</HI> puni&s;hment. It is an endle&s;s lo&s;s of not only all the good which the man at pre&s;ent enjoys; but of all that good which he would have enjoyed throughout eternity, in the &s;tate of bli&s;s to which he would have been admitted, if he had never &s;inned. This in an endle&s;s duration would amount to an infinite quantity of good. Annihilation therefore is an infinite puni&s;hment both as it is endle&s;s, and as the quantity of good lo&s;t is infinite: and Dr. C. in allowing that endle&s;s annihilation would be no more than a ju&s;t puni&s;hment of &s;in, allows, that &s;in de&s;erves an infinite puni&s;hment, or that it is an infinite evil, though it is the fault of a finite creature, in a finite life, and the effect of finite principles, pa&s;&s;ions and appetites. If therefore it be a difficulty hard to be &s;olved, that a finite creature, in a finite life, &s;hould commit an infinite evil, meaning a crime which may be ju&s;tly puni&s;hed with an endle&s;s puni&s;hment; it is a diffi|culty that equally concerned Dr. C. as my&s;elf; and it was ab&s;urd for him to object that to others, which lay equally in his own way.</P>
<P>IT may be objected to the&s;e ob&s;ervations, that endle&s;s annihilation is not an infinite puni&s;hment, becau&s;e it may be inflicted on even an innocent per&s;on. God having once communicated exi&s;tence is under no obligation to perpetu|ate it; but for wi&s;e ends may without injury &s;uffer even the mo&s;t holy of his creatures, after the enjoyment of exi&s;tence and of good for a &s;ea&s;on, to drop into their original nothing. To this it may be an&s;wered; that this objection equally proves, that annihilation is no puni&s;hment at all, as that it is not an <HI>infinite</HI> puni&s;hment. When an innocent creature is &s;uffered in &s;overeign wi&s;dom to drop into non-exi&s;tence, this is not only not an infinite puni&s;hment, but is no puni&s;hment at all. A puni&s;hment is &s;ome evil brought on a per&s;on, in te&s;timony that his conduct is di&s;approved by the author of that evil. This is not the ca&s;e in the annihilation of the innocent per&s;on now &s;uppo&s;ed. Therefore it equally fol|lows from the po&s;&s;ible annihilation of an innocent creature, that the annihilation of the wicked would be no puni&s;h|ment at all, as that it would not be an infinite puni&s;hment. Annihilation is an infinite lo&s;s, and in that &s;en&s;e, an in|finite
<PB N="90" REF="022478_0095_0FB9361572EFC798">
evil, to an innocent per&s;on, as well as to one ever &s;o guilty. But as it is not inflicted on the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, in te&s;ti|mony of di&s;approbation, it is not a puni&s;hment. On the other hand, if it be inflicted at all on the wicked, it is in|flicted in expre&s;s te&s;timony of the divine abhorrence of their conduct, and therefore is a puni&s;hment: and any pu|ni&s;hment, which is an infinite evil, is an infinite puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>TO illu&s;trate this, let the following example be taken. A parent having begun the mo&s;t liberal and advantageous education of his &s;on, may for wi&s;e rea&s;ons, entirely drop, without any inju&s;tice to his &s;on, the cour&s;e of education, which he had begun, and may &s;uffer him to grow up in comparative ignorance. This would not only not be a very great puni&s;hment of his &s;on, but no puni&s;hment at all. Whereas, if he &s;hould treat his &s;on in the &s;ame manner, from the motive of te&s;tifying his di&s;plea&s;ure at &s;ome tri|fling levity or childi&s;h inadvertence, it would be both a real and a very great puni&s;hment: and though it would con&s;i&s;t in a lo&s;s or privation, yet it would be a much greater puni&s;h|ment than the infliction of a very con&s;iderable po&s;itive pain. In like manner, though annihilation may be inflicted in &s;uch a manner, as to be no puni&s;hment; yet when it is inflicted with the declared de&s;ign of exhibiting the divine di&s;plea|&s;ure at &s;in; it is a far greater puni&s;hment, than a very great and long temporary mi&s;ery.&mdash;That annihilation is an e|vil, no man will deny, who allows that exi&s;tence and hap|pine&s;s are good. And if it be an evil, it is an evil equal to the good lo&s;t by it, taking into view the continuance of that lo&s;s; and as this is infinite, final annihilation is an in|finite evil: and whenever it is inflicted in te&s;timony of di&s;|approbation of the conduct of the &s;inner, it is an infinite puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>DOUBTLESS Dr. C. was of the opinion, that annihilation may be a puni&s;hment, as it was his belief, that if his &s;cheme of univer&s;al &s;alvation be not true, the wicked are to be annihilated. He would doubtle&s;s have allowed, that annihilation will not be brought on them in te&s;timony of the divine approbation of their conduct. Nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fruit of perfect indifference in the divine mind, with re&s;pect to their conduct. It mu&s;t therefore be a te&s;timony of divine di&s;approbation, which con&s;titutes it a

<P>PERHAPS it may be further &s;aid, in oppo&s;ition to what has been now advanced, that the meaning of tho&s;e who a&s;|&s;ert, that &s;in does not de&s;erve an infinite puni&s;hment, is not, that &s;in does not de&s;erve an endle&s;s <HI>privation,</HI> or <HI>negative</HI> puni&s;hment; but that it does not de&s;erve an endle&s;s <HI>po&s;itive</HI> puni&s;hment, con&s;i&s;ting in <HI>po&s;itive pains</HI> or <HI>torments.</HI>&mdash;If the objection be thus explained, it comes to this merely, that &s;in does indeed de&s;erve an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, and &s;o is truly and properly an infinite evil, in the &s;en&s;e in which any of us hold it to be an infinite evil: but it is not <HI>&s;uch</HI> an infinite evil, as to de&s;erve &s;o great an endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment, as endle&s;s po&s;itive pain and torment. But this &s;tat|ing of the objection entirely &s;hifts the ground of the di&s;pute: granting, that an endle&s;s puni&s;hment is ju&s;tly de&s;erved by &s;in, it denies, that &s;o great <HI>a degree</HI> of puni&s;hment, as end|le&s;s po&s;itive mi&s;ery, is de&s;erved by it. Endle&s;s annihilation is equally and as truly an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, as endle&s;s tor|ment. Nor is there any ground of objection to the one more than to the other, on account of any difference in du|ration, or that in which alone the infinity con&s;i&s;ts. But the ground of objection to endle&s;s mi&s;ery, rather than to end|le&s;s annihilation, is, that it is a greater, more dreadful, and more intolerable puni&s;hment; or a greater puni&s;hment <HI>in degree.</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES, not every <HI>degree</HI> of endle&s;s <HI>pain</HI> is a greater e|vil or puni&s;hment, than endle&s;s annihilation. No man will pretend, that any &s;light pain continued to eternity, is &s;o great an evil, as endle&s;s annihilation and the endle&s;s lo&s;s of all enjoyment and exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>ON the whole, as the &s;tate of the argument before us, is now wholly &s;hifted; as it is granted by the objector, that &s;in de&s;erves an infinite or endle&s;s puni&s;hment, but not &s;o great an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, as is implied in <HI>&s;ome degrees</HI> of endle&s;s pain; every thing for which we contend, as to the duration of future puni&s;hment, is granted. It is not
<PB N="92" REF="022478_0097_0FB93619DE733A20">
pretended by the advocates for endle&s;s puni&s;hment, that &s;in de&s;erves an infinite <HI>degree</HI> of endle&s;s puni&s;hment. Nor do they pretend to <HI>determine</HI> the <HI>degree</HI> of puni&s;hment, which it de&s;erves. It becomes all to leave that to God, who alone is able to determine it. The advocates for tem|porary puni&s;hment will not pretend to determine the de|gree of temporary puni&s;hment, which &s;in de&s;erves. The <HI>degree</HI> of future puni&s;hment is not the &s;ubject of the pre|&s;ent di&s;pute. I might now therefore fairly di&s;mi&s;s the fur|ther di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the infinite evil of &s;in, as on account of the conce&s;&s;ions already mentioned, wholly impertinent to the pre&s;ent di&s;pute. But wi&s;hing to relieve what difficul|ties, and to throw what light on the &s;ubject, I can, I pro|ceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>PERHAPS it may be yet further pleaded, that the oppo|&s;ers of the infinite evil of &s;in mean, that &s;in does not de|&s;erve &s;uch an endle&s;s po&s;itive mi&s;ery, as is wor&s;e than non-exi&s;tence.&mdash;As to this, be&s;ides that it makes the &s;ubject of the di&s;pute to be wholly the <HI>degree</HI> of puni&s;hment, and not the <HI>duration</HI> of it; it may be remarked, that it is grant|ed in this plea, that it would be ju&s;t, if all the wicked, who die in impenitence, were annihilated. Annihilation there|fore is the puni&s;hment de&s;erved by the lea&s;t &s;inner, who dies in impenitence; and tho&s;e, who&s;e guilt is more aggra|vated, de&s;erve a greater puni&s;hment; and as &s;ome are incon|ceivably greater &s;inners than the lea&s;t, they de&s;erve an in|conceivably greater puni&s;hment than annihilation. Again, as the lea&s;t &s;inner de&s;erves annihilation, &s;o he de&s;erves that degree of po&s;itive pain, or that mixture of pain and plea|&s;ure, which is equally unde&s;irable, or equally dreadful as non-exi&s;tence. Therefore tho&s;e, who are inconceivably greater &s;inners than the lea&s;t, de&s;erve that degree of po&s;i|tive endle&s;s pain, which is inconceivably wor&s;e and more to be dreaded, than non-exi&s;tence, or than that mixture of pain and plea&s;ure, which is equally to be dreaded as non-exi&s;tence. Therefore from principles conceded by Dr. C. it clearly follows, not only that all &s;inners de&s;erve an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, but that all &s;inners, except tho&s;e of the very lowe&s;t cla&s;s, de&s;erve that degree of endle&s;s mi&s;ery, which is wor&s;e than non-exi&s;tence; and which is not only an infinite evil, but an evil doubly infinite, as the lo&s;s is infinite, and the po&s;itive mi&s;ery exceeding all the good enjoyed, be|ing endle&s;s, is infinite too.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="93" REF="022478_0098_0FB9361AE59B3E38">2. THE argument of Dr. C. now under con&s;ideration, "If it prove any thing, proves a great deal too much," as it &s;uppo&s;es, that any crime can ju&s;tly be puni&s;hed for no longer time, than was con&s;umed in the perpetration of the crime.&mdash;That this is implied in the argument, will appear, if we con&s;ider, that if it be once allowed, that a crime may be puni&s;hed for a longer time than was con&s;umed in the perpetration of it, the whole argument, that a creature can|not, in a finite life, commit &s;uch &s;in, as &s;hall de&s;erve an end|le&s;s puni&s;hment, mu&s;t be given up. If a man may in one day commit a crime, which de&s;erves a puni&s;hment to be continued for a year, who will &s;ay, that he may not in one day commit a crime, which &s;hall de&s;erve a puni&s;hment to be continued for <HI>two</HI> years, for <HI>ten</HI> years, or during his life? Therefore in determining the duration of the puni&s;hment, no regard at all is had to the time taken up in the perpe|tration of the crime. And if no regard be had to this, there is no ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing, that the crimes of a fi|nite life may de&s;erve an endle&s;s puni&s;hment. To &s;ay, that there is an ab&s;urdity in it, &s;uppo&s;es, that in adju&s;ting the puni&s;hment, a regard is always to be had to the time taken up in the perpetration of the crime; which is contrary to known fact, as well as to the deduction ju&s;t now made. Nay, it implies, as I before ob&s;erved, that no ju&s;t puni&s;h|ment can be continued for a longer time, than was con&s;u|med in the perpetration of the crime.&mdash;The mere dura|tion of puni&s;hment is of no importance or con&s;ideration, un|le&s;s the whole puni&s;hment be exce&s;&s;ive. Therefore perpetual impri&s;onment is inflicted for crimes, which are perpetrated in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>BY the &s;ame argument, by which Dr. C. undertakes to prove, that &s;in does not de&s;erve an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, any man may undertake to prove, that it does not de&s;erve a puni&s;hment to continue for ages of ages. The Doctor's argument is, that &s;in de&s;erves no more than a temporary puni&s;hment, becau&s;e it is committed in a finite duration. With the &s;ame &s;trength of argument it may be &s;aid: Sin de&s;erves not a puni&s;hment of ages of ages, but a puni&s;hment of no longer duration, than &s;eventy years, becau&s;e it is com|mitted in the &s;pace of &s;eventy years.&mdash;It is manife&s;t, that when a puni&s;hment of ages of ages is inflicted on the &s;inner, no regard is had to the time con&s;umed in the perpetration of &s;in. And if it be ju&s;t to inflict a puni&s;hment in one ca&s;e,
<PB N="94" REF="022478_0099_0FB9323BED266538">
without regard to the time con&s;umed in the perpetration of &s;in, why not in another? If becau&s;e &s;in is the fault of a fi|nite life, it does not de&s;erve an infinite puni&s;hment; then becau&s;e it is the fault of a life of le&s;s duration, than that of ages of ages, it does not de&s;erve a puni&s;hment which is to continue for ages of ages.&mdash;Or how will Dr. C. prove, that &s;in, the fault of a life, which is to continue only &s;eventy years, de&s;erves a puni&s;hment, which is to continue for ages of ages? I pre&s;ume he will not pretend to prove it by any proportion between the duration of &s;eventy years and that of ages of ages; but merely by revelation. From the &s;ame &s;ource of evidence, we undertake to prove both the reality and ju&s;tice of endle&s;s puni&s;hment. And it is as ineffectual to object to our proof of endle&s;s puni&s;hment, the di&s;propor|tion between an infinite and a finite duration, as it is to ob|ject to his proof of a puni&s;hment of ages of ages, the di&s;|proportion between the duration of ages of ages, and that of &s;eventy years. I grant that the di&s;proportion between infinite and finite duration, is greater, than that between ages of ages and &s;eventy years. But, when the time con&s;u|med in the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime is not at all regarded, let the di&s;proportion be what it may, nothing can be thence concluded.</P>
<P>IF it be &s;till pretended, that a regard to the time con&s;u|med in the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in is had, in determining the du|ration of its puni&s;hment <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;k what regard is had to it? If the duration of the puni&s;hment may at all exceed the time con&s;umed in the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, how much may the for|mer exceed the latter? To &s;ay there is an infinite di&s;pro|portion between a &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> life, and an endle&s;s eternity, affords no &s;atisfaction. So there is a very great di&s;proportion be|tween a life of &s;eventy years, and ages of ages. And if on the principles of Dr. C. an endle&s;s puni&s;hment be more un|ju&s;t than that of ages of ages, is not the latter on the &s;ame principles really unju&s;t? If not, then a puni&s;hment, the du|ration of which is greatly di&s;proportionate to the time con|&s;umed in the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime, is &s;till ju&s;t: and who will undertake to fix the degrees of di&s;proportion between the duration of the puni&s;hment, and the time con&s;umed in the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime, which are con&s;i&s;tent, and which are incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice? And let a rea&s;on be given, why it is not as really unju&s;t to inflict a puni&s;hment, the du|ration of which is greatly di&s;proportionate to the time &s;pent in the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime, as to inflict a puni&s;hment,
<PB N="95" REF="022478_0100_0FB9323D700142C8">
the duration of which bears no proportion to the time &s;pent in the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime. Why would not the &s;ame argument from the di&s;proportion of the dura|tion of the puni&s;hment, to the time &s;pent in committing the &s;in, prove, that Adam was unju&s;tly puni&s;hed, in that he was condemned to eat bread in the &s;weat of his face, <HI>all the days of his life,</HI> for the &s;in of eating the forbidden fruit, which was doubtle&s;s fini&s;hed in a very &s;hort time? Al&s;o, that David was unju&s;tly puni&s;hed, in that <HI>the &s;word never depart|ed from his hou&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e of his &s;in in the matter of Uriah?</P>
<P>IF a finite creature, in a finite time, cannot commit an in|finite evil, or one which de&s;erves an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, it will follow, that even our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, if he be a real creature, though the fir&s;t born of every creature,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So far as can be judged from the book of Dr. C. now un|der examination, and &s;ome others of his works, he would not have objected to this character of Chri&s;t.</NOTE> cannot, if he were di&s;po&s;ed, commit an infinite evil. Yet as he created and upholds all things by the word of his pow|er, he doubtle&s;s has power to annihilate all things. Now I a&s;k, whether if Chri&s;t &s;hould annihilate the whole crea|ted &s;y&s;tem, him&s;elf only excepted, it would be a finite or an infinite evil? If the an&s;wer &s;hould be, that it would be a finite evil, I would a&s;k again, whether it would not be as great an evil to the univer&s;e, as the endle&s;s mi&s;ery of one &s;inner, provided he de&s;erves that mi&s;ery.&mdash;I make this this provi&s;o, becau&s;e we do not plead for endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment on any other &s;uppo&s;ition, than that it is ju&s;t: And if it &s;hould be &s;aid, that the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of a &s;inner is an infinite evil, becau&s;e it is unju&s;tly inflicted, this would be a begging of the que&s;tion: it would al&s;o follow, that on the &s;uppo&s;ition of the ju&s;tice of the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the &s;inner, it is not an infinite evil, and therefore there is no foundation for the objection now under con&s;ideration, that &s;in a finite moral evil is puni&s;hed with an infinite natural e|vil or puni&s;hment.&mdash;Be&s;ide, that the endle&s;s annihilation of the created &s;y&s;tem would be an infinite evil in the very &s;ame &s;en&s;e, in which the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the damned is an infinite evil, is evident from this con&s;ideration, that the puni&s;hment of the damned is not pretended to be infi|nite in any other re&s;pect, th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> in duration. In the very &s;ame re&s;pect the endle&s;s annihilation of which we &s;peak, is infinite.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="022478_0101_0FB9323EEF6550E8">IF the an&s;wer to the que&s;tion ju&s;t propo&s;ed, &s;hould be, that the annihilation of the created &s;y&s;tem would be an in|finite evil; the con&s;equence is, that an infinite evil may be cau&s;ed or committed by a finite creature, in a finite time.</P>
<P>POSSIBLY it may be further objected, that if our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t be a mere creature, he had no power in him|&s;elf to create the univer&s;e; but created it by a divine pow|er communicated for that purpo&s;e: and that if he &s;hould annihilate it, he mu&s;t do it by the &s;ame communicated pow|er. Therefore Chri&s;t him&s;elf has it not in his power, to effect an infinite evil.&mdash;But we are to ob&s;erve, that if Chri&s;t was a proper intelligent moral agent in creation, that work is his work, and properly to be a&s;cribed to him, as properly as any actions of men are to be a&s;cribed to them. It is allowed on all hands, that all men have re|ceived all their powers of action from their creator; yet no man will di&s;pute, whether the&s;e actions be the proper actions of men, or whether the effects produced by the&s;e actions be imputable to them, as their proper cau&s;es. Therefore with at lea&s;t as great truth and propriety is Chri&s;t, even on the &s;uppo&s;ition that he is a mere creature, the proper cau&s;e of all his works, whether of creation or annihilation, as men in general are the cau&s;es of their works. He cannot po&s;&s;ibly be more dependent for his powers, than we are for ours. Nor is it of any importance to the &s;ub|ject now under con&s;ideration, whether Chri&s;t had original|ly the power of creation and annihilation, or whether it was communicated to him afterwards. A power given by God at one time, is as really given by him, as if it were gi|ven at another time.</P>
<P>IN the argument again&s;t the infinite evil of &s;in, that a fi|nite creature cannot commit an infinite evil, in a finite time; the finitude of <HI>the time</HI> is either e&s;&s;ential to the va|lidity of the argument, or it is not. If it be e&s;&s;ential, it implies, as was before ob&s;erved, that no crime can de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed for a longer time, than was con&s;umed in the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime. If the finitude of the time be not e&s;&s;ential to the argument, but the meaning be, that a finite creature cannot at all commit an infinite evil, becau&s;e he is a <HI>finite creature,</HI> it will follow, that if the whole &s;y&s;tem of intelligent creatures were to revolt from God, and to con|tinue in their revolt to an ab&s;olute eternity, it would be but a finite evil.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="022478_0102_0FB93241ED7EB698">OBJECTION: The time never can come, at which the &s;y&s;tem of creatures &s;hall have continued to an ab&s;olute eter|nity, in their revolt from God. Though therefore we &s;uppo&s;e that the whole created &s;y&s;tem &s;hould revolt, it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that they &s;hall have continued in their revolt to an ab&s;olute eternity: and therefore it is impo&s;|&s;ible, that the whole created &s;y&s;tem &s;hould have com|mitted an infinite evil.&mdash;ANSWER. For the &s;ame rea&s;on it is impo&s;&s;ible, that a creature &s;hould have been puni&s;hed to an ab&s;olute eternity. The longe&s;t puni&s;hment to which any &s;uppo&s;e the wicked are doomed, is in no other &s;en&s;e infinite, than that in which the revolt which has been &s;up|po&s;ed, may be infinite. If then the wicked be not doomed to an infinite or endle&s;s puni&s;hment; &s;in is not, on any &s;cheme, puni&s;hed with an infinite puni&s;hment; and then the whole objection of puni&s;hing a finite evil, with an in|finite puni&s;hment, falls to the ground.</P>
<P>BUT this whole argument, founded on the finitude of the life and of the capacity of the &s;inner, was virtually given up by Dr. C. in that he believed, that endle&s;s an|nihilation would be a ju&s;t puni&s;hment of &s;in: though the duration of the puni&s;hment in this ca&s;e, would infinitely exceed the time con&s;umed in the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in.</P>
<P N="3">III. WE come at length to con&s;ider the third argument of Dr. C. again&s;t the ju&s;tice of endle&s;s puni&s;hment, which is, that endle&s;s puni&s;hment, on account of the infinite evil of &s;in, as committed again&s;t a God of infinite glory, implies, that future puni&s;hment is infinite or to the utmo&s;t in <HI>degree,</HI> as well as <HI>duration,</HI> and therefore that the pu|ni&s;hment of all the damned is equal, which is both ab&s;urd and contrary to &s;cripture. This I take to be the argu|ment intended in the latter part of the la&s;t quotation made in the beginning of this chapter.&mdash;On this it is ob&s;ervable, that though a &s;inner, on account of the infinite evil of &s;in as committed again&s;t a God of infinite glory, de&s;erve and &s;hall &s;uffer an endle&s;s puni&s;hment; it by no means follows, that he de&s;erves or will &s;uffer that puni&s;hment which is infinite in degree too, or which is to the utmo&s;t degree in which any &s;inner is puni&s;hed. All that follows from the infinite evil of &s;in is, that it de&s;erves an infinite puni&s;h|ment; and an endle&s;s puni&s;hment is an infinite puni&s;h|ment, though it be not to the utmo&s;t in degree. There|fore, when Dr. C. &s;ays,
<Q>According to this way of ar|guing,
<PB N="98" REF="022478_0103_0FB93244F66E9DB8">
all &s;inners mu&s;t &s;uffer to the utmo&s;t <HI>in degree,</HI> as well as duration, otherwi&s;e, they will not &s;uffer &s;o much as they ought to do;</Q>
he merely a&s;&s;erts what he ought to have proved. Therefore he fails in his attempt to fa&s;ten on the doctrine of the infinite evil of &s;in, the ab|&s;urdity that the puni&s;hment of all the damned will be equal. He might as well have argued, that becau&s;e all &s;aints &s;hall receive an infinite or an endle&s;s reward; the reward of every one will be to the utmo&s;t in degree, and the reward of all will be equal.</P>
<P>OR if the meaning of this argument be, that the wick|ed will all be puni&s;hed equally, not becau&s;e they will &s;uf|fer an <HI>endle&s;s</HI> puni&s;hment, but becau&s;e they all &s;in again&s;t the &s;ame infinitely glorious object, and therefore their &s;ins are all equal: the an&s;wer is, that the con&s;equence by no means follows from the premi&s;es. Though it be true, that the wicked all &s;in again&s;t the &s;ame God, and on that ac|count all de&s;erve endle&s;s puni&s;hment? yet it no more fol|lows thence, that they all de&s;erve the &s;ame puni&s;hment in degree, than if a number of &s;ubjects &s;hould rebel again&s;t the &s;ame excellent Prince, it would follow, that they are equally guilty, and all de&s;erve an equal puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>THE expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>infinite evil of &s;in,</HI> &s;eems to be very of|fen&s;ive to &s;ome gentlemen. They &s;eem to conceive that it means as great an evil or crime, as it is po&s;&s;ible for a man to commit, the moral turpitude of which can in no re&s;pect be increa&s;ed.&mdash;This idea of the infinite evil of &s;in is very different from that which is entertained by tho&s;e who hold, that &s;in is an infinite evil. All they mean is, that &s;in is in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e an infinite evil, that it may be ju&s;tly followed by an endle&s;s puni&s;hment. It no more follows hence, that the moral turpitude of any particular &s;in can not be increa&s;ed, than that the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of it cannot be increa&s;ed; or than that the endle&s;s happine&s;s of the &s;aints in heaven cannot be increa&s;ed. Indeed, neither the happine&s;s of heaven, nor the mi&s;ery of hell can be increa&s;ed in <HI>duration</HI>: nor can the turpitude of &s;in be &s;o increa&s;ed, as to de&s;erve a greater duration of puni&s;hment, than that which is endle&s;s. But as both the happine&s;s of heaven and the mi&s;ery of hell, though endle&s;s, may be in|crea&s;ed <HI>in degree</HI>; &s;o may the turpitude of &s;in be &s;o in|crea&s;ed, as to de&s;erve a greater degree of puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="022478_0104_0FB932480F915A00">WHEN it is &s;aid, that if the evil of &s;in be infinite, it is as great as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;o all &s;ins are equal; it &s;eems to be implied, that all infinites are equal in all re&s;pects, than which nothing is more fal&s;e. An infinite line, an infinite &s;uperficies, and an infinite &s;olid, are all infinites, and they are all equal in one re&s;pect or dimen&s;ion, that of <HI>length.</HI> But a line though truly infinite in length, is not in the di|men&s;ion of breadth equal to an infinite &s;uperficies. Nor is a &s;uperficies, though truly infinite in the two dimen&s;ions of length and breadth, equal in depth to an infinite &s;olid.&mdash; To apply this, &s;in may be infinitely aggravated with re|&s;pect to the object again&s;t whom it is committed, and in that re&s;pect it may be incapable of an increa&s;e of aggrava|tion. Still it may not be infinite with re&s;pect to the de|gree of oppo&s;ition, or virulence and malignity to the object, again&s;t whom it is committed.</P>
<P>BY the infinite evil of &s;in therefore is meant, that &s;in tru|ly de&s;erves an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, as it is committed again&s;t an infinitely glorious object, again&s;t God him&s;elf, his autho|rity, his law, his government; and as it enervates the laws, violates the peace and &s;afety of his kingdom, introduces con|fu&s;ion and ruin, and would actually ruin entirely that king|dom, and the happine&s;s of all who belong to it, were not mea&s;ures taken by God to prevent its natural effect. In this re&s;pect it is infinitely evil, and in this re&s;pect, in which it is infinitely evil, the evil of it cannot be increa&s;ed, becau&s;e the object again&s;t which it is committed, cannot be greater, more important, or more excellent; and in this re&s;pect all &s;ins are equal. But by the infinite evil of &s;in, is not meant an evil, which de&s;erves an infinite degree of puni&s;hment; or an act of oppo&s;ition to God and his king|dom, which is infinitely virulent or malicious. In this re|&s;pect the evil of &s;in may be increa&s;ed, and in this re&s;pect all &s;ins are by no means equal.&mdash;The evil of any one &s;in is not &s;o great, but that on the whole it may be increa&s;ed, as the happine&s;s of heaven is not &s;o great, but that on the whole that may be increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>THOUGH the turpitude of &s;in is infinite with re&s;pect to the object oppo&s;ed, yet it is not infinite as to the degree of oppo&s;ition. If a &s;ubject rebel again&s;t the mo&s;t excellent &s;overeign on earth, his crime is, in re&s;pect to the object, as great as he can commit in rebellion again&s;t a temporal prince; becau&s;e by &s;uppo&s;ition he cannot be the &s;ubject of
<PB N="100" REF="022478_0105_0FB9324F5EF5B090">
a better temporal prince, and therefore he cannot rebel a|gain&s;t a better. Yet this rebellion may be more aggrava|ted by greater degrees of oppo&s;ition, abu&s;e or in&s;ult to this &s;ame excellent prince.</P>
<P>WHAT has been now &s;aid concerning the infinite evil of &s;in, has been in the way of explanation, and in an&s;wer to Dr. C's objections. The po&s;itive proof, that &s;in is an infi|nite evil, has been &s;o largely and ably given by others, that the reader will allow me to refer him to them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;ident Edwards's &s;ermon on the <HI>Eternity of hell-tor|ments,</HI> and his tract on <HI>Ju&s;tification.</HI> Dr. Bellamy's <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the Go&s;pel,</HI> Sect. V. Mr. Hopkins on the <HI>Future State,</HI> Sect. IV.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS I have particularly attended to the arguments brought by Dr. C. to prove, that the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the wicked would not be ju&s;t.&mdash;I &s;hall now proceed to a more general con&s;ideration of the ju&s;tice of endle&s;s puni&s;hment con&s;i&s;ting in mi&s;ery, and to &s;ome arguments in proof of it. The fir&s;t argument to which I wi&s;h to direct the attention of the reader, is, that if endle&s;s puni&s;hment be the cur&s;e of the divine law, or the puni&s;hment threaten|ed in the divine law, as the wages of &s;in, or as the proper puni&s;hment of &s;inners; undoubtedly it is ju&s;t. It is impo&s;|&s;ible, that a God of perfect and infinite ju&s;tice &s;hould threat|en an unju&s;t puni&s;hment.&mdash;I am indeed aware, that it is not a conceded point, that endle&s;s mi&s;ery is threatened in the divine law: I therefore purpo&s;e to attempt the proof of it.&mdash;The cur&s;e of the divine law is either endle&s;s an|nihilation, or it is that mi&s;ery which the wicked in fact &s;uf|fer in hell, or it is &s;ome temporary mi&s;ery of greater dura|tion than that which is actually &s;uffered in hell, or it is end|le&s;s mi&s;ery. The&s;e &s;everal hypothe&s;es &s;hall come under con|&s;ideration in the following chapters.</P>
<P>BUT before I proceed, it may be proper to explain in what &s;en&s;e I u&s;e the word <HI>law,</HI> in this inquiry concerning the cur&s;e of the divine law.&mdash;By the divine law, I mean not merely any po&s;itive, revealed law, as that given to Adam concerning the tree of knowledge of good and evil: but what Dr. C. calls "the moral law of God," and
<Q>the law of works, as requiring perfect, actual, indefect|able obedience.</Q>
The Doctor allows, that "he" [Adam]
<Q>was, without all doubt, under &s;trict indi&s;pen&s;able obli|gations to obey every command of God, wherein it
<PB N="101" REF="022478_0106_0FB9325411CC9460">
&s;hould be made known to him&mdash;and mu&s;t have rendered him&s;elf obnoxious to the righteous re&s;entments of his God and king, had he expre&s;&s;ed any di&s;regard to any of them.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">5 Di&s;&s;. p. 55.</NOTE> This he &s;peaks concerning the moral law, as may be &s;een by the context. And doubtle&s;s as Adam was obligated to obey "every command" of the moral law, and in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience, was
<Q>obnoxious to the righ|teous re&s;entments of God,</Q>
the &s;ame is true of every other man. The righteous re&s;entment of God for di&s;|obedience to this law, is that very <HI>cur&s;e of the law,</HI> from which Chri&s;t hath redeemed his people, and which is the proper object of our pre&s;ent inquiry. By law taken in this &s;en&s;e, Dr. C. abundantly holds, that no man can be ju&s;ti|fied.
<Q>By <HI>law,</HI> the apo&s;tle &s;ometimes means law in ge|neral, both the law written in men's hearts, and in the books of revelation&mdash;&s;ometimes&mdash;the Mo&s;aic law in &s;pecial. But whether he under&s;tand by it natural or revealed law, or law including both; works done in conformity to it, when mentioned with reference to ju&s;tification, he always &s;ets a&s;ide as totally in&s;ufficient for the procurement of it.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">12 Sermons, p. 4.</NOTE> Here the Doctor tells us in what &s;en&s;e he u&s;es the word <HI>law,</HI> which is the &s;ame in which I u&s;e it, in the pre&s;ent inquiry: and as he a&s;&s;erts in this context, and in very many other pa&s;&s;ages, that no man, "Jew or Gentile," can be ju&s;tified on the foot of law taken in the &s;en&s;e ju&s;t explained; of cour&s;e all men are condemned by the law, and the puni&s;hment to which the law condemns all, is the cur&s;e of the law; or the cur&s;e of the law is that puni&s;hment to which the moral law con|demns every man who tran&s;gre&s;&s;es it.</P>

<P>DOCTOR C's fir&s;t object was, to prove that all men will be finally happy. &mdash; If he &s;hould fail in this, his la&s;t re&s;ort was <HI>annihilation.</HI>
<Q>If the foregoing &s;cheme,</Q>

Having made the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the <HI>next</HI> is the <HI>final</HI> &s;tate of men, he &s;ays,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 288.</NOTE>
<Q>It is mo&s;t peremptorily affirmed, that they</Q>
(the wicked)
<Q>&s;hall <HI>reap corruption, peri&s;h,</HI> be <HI>de&s;troyed,</HI> and <HI>die a &s;econd time</HI>; which fixes the &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> when joined with the <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> they &s;hall be doomed to undergo, limiting its meaning to an age, or period of duration only.</Q>
Corruption, perdition, de&s;truction, and the &s;econd death do not limit the meaning of the word everla&s;ting, unle&s;s it be on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that tho&s;e words them&s;elves mean annihilation. Sometimes by tho&s;e words Dr. C. &s;eems to have meant a tran&s;ition from one future &s;tate of exi&s;tence to another; at other times he expre&s;&s;ly declares that they mean <HI>mi&s;ery, torment.</HI> Now if tho&s;e words applied to the wicked mean a tran&s;ition from the next &s;tate of exi&s;tence to another, they by no means certainly limit their mi&s;ery. This tran&s;ition may be from one &s;tate of mi&s;ery to another &s;tate of mi&s;ery; as Dr. C. &s;uppo&s;ed that they might pa&s;s through &s;everal future &s;tates of mi&s;ery, before they &s;hould arrive at happine&s;s. Nay, from the words u&s;ed in this &s;en&s;e, no inference can be drawn, that they will <HI>ever</HI> arrive at a &s;tate of happine&s;s: becau&s;e a tran&s;ition from one &s;tate of mi&s;ery to another &s;tate of mi&s;ery, is as truly a tran&s;ition, as a tran&s;ition from a &s;tate of mi&s;ery to a &s;tate of happine&s;s.&mdash;But if tho&s;e words mean <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> or <HI>torment,</HI> they certainly do not limit the future mi&s;ery of the wicked; as will more fully ap|pear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="022478_0108_0FB93257B1265DF0">I DO not find any proof offered by Dr. C. that the wicked will be annihilated, unle&s;s he con&s;ider the very meaning of the words <HI>de&s;truction, death,</HI> &amp;c. as a proof.

<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Page 337.</NOTE> How &s;trange then is it, that Dr. C. &s;hould urge the literal and original meaning of the words <HI>death, de&s;truction,</HI> &amp;c. as an argument for annihilation, when he him&s;elf &s;uppo&s;ed that they mean not annihilation, but obviou&s;ly mean <HI>mi&s;ery!</HI> and that he &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that they limit the &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> when it is joined to the mi&s;ery of the damned!

<P>Perhaps &s;ome admirers of Dr. C. may attempt to re|concile this incon&s;i&s;tence, by &s;aying, he held that the words <HI>death, de&s;truction,</HI> &amp;c. mean and prove annihilation, on the &s;ole &s;uppo&s;ition, that the next &s;tate is final: that on any other &s;uppo&s;ition he held that they mean mi&s;ery.&mdash; But this would be a vain attempt.

a proof of it, than <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> words <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> and <HI>torment</HI>; be|cau&s;e by his own conce&s;&s;ions, they are at lea&s;t capable of meaning mi&s;ery or torment. Therefore though Dr. C's &s;cheme of univer&s;al happine&s;s &s;hould fail, we &s;hould from the application of the words <HI>death, de&s;truction,</HI> &amp;c. to the wicked, be under no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uppo&s;ing that they will be annihilated; everla&s;ting de&s;truction may mean ever|la&s;ting mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>THE truth appears to be, that Dr. C. was led to adopt, as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> la&s;t re&s;ort, the idea of the annihilation of the wicked, not by the obvious meaning and u&s;e of the words <HI>death</HI> and <HI>de&s;truction</HI> in &s;cripture; &s;ince he allows they ob|viou&s;ly mean mi&s;ery or torment; but by the preconcep|tion, that it is a certain truth, that the endle&s;s mi&s;ery of any of mankind can never exi&s;t. To this preconceived opinion the &s;cripture mu&s;t &s;ome way or other be accom|modated.</P>
<P>BUT let us proceed to &s;ome con&s;iderations to confirm the propo&s;ition, that annihilation is not the cur&s;e or puni&s;h|ment denounced again&s;t &s;in in the divine law.</P>
<P>THE doctrine, that annihilation is the cur&s;e of the di|vine law, may be holden in two different &s;en&s;es, both which I conceive to be entirely oppo&s;ite to the truth.&mdash; It is the &s;entiment of many, that annihilation is the puni&s;h|ment of &s;in threatened in the law, and is actually inflicted on tho&s;e who die impenitent.&mdash;Again; it is the &s;entiment of &s;ome, that though annihilation will not be inflicted on any; yet it is the cur&s;e which was originally in the law de|nounced again&s;t &s;in; but that Chri&s;t hath ab&s;olutely re|deemed all from it; and therefore none will &s;uffer it.</P>
<P N="1">I.

<P N="1">1.

<P>BUT how can tho&s;e who are annihilated, be &s;aid to be ca&s;t into <HI>fire,</HI> into a lake of <HI>fire</HI> and <HI>brim&s;tone,</HI> and to be <HI>tormented</HI> there; to have no re&s;t; to <HI>weep,</HI> and <HI>wail</HI> and <HI>gna&s;h their teeth; to dwell</HI> with everla&s;ting <HI>burnings?</HI>&mdash; As well might the&s;e things be &s;aid of them before they were created.&mdash;How can they be &s;aid <HI>to plead</HI> for admi&s;&s;ion into heaven, and to <HI>rea&s;on</HI> on the &s;ubject with the ma&s;ter of the cele&s;tial man&s;ions?

The &s;cribes and Phari&s;ees were to receive the greater damnation, Matt. XXIII. 14.&mdash;But if annihilation be the puni&s;hment of the wicked, there is no difference between the puni&s;hment of the lea&s;t &s;inner and the greate&s;t, who die impenitent: which is both ab&s;urd in it&s;elf and ab&s;olutely contradictory to the &s;criptural account.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be pleaded in an&s;wer to this argument, that though all the wicked &s;hall &s;uffer annihilation; yet the puni&s;hment of all will not be the &s;ame; as the more ag|gravated &s;inners will be made the &s;ubjects of mi&s;ery for a while, and then be annihilated: it may be replied, that this &s;uppo&s;es the cur&s;e of the law to con&s;i&s;t in two things, temporary mi&s;ery and annihilation. But where have we any hint in the &s;cripture, that the cur&s;e of the law, as &s;uf|fered in the future world, is &s;uch a heterogeneous com|pound as this?&mdash;After all, it &s;eems, that annihilation is but a &s;mall part of that cur&s;e; for that alone will be inflicted on the lea&s;t &s;inner only, and on account of the lea&s;t &s;in; and all that puni&s;hment which &s;hall be inflicted on any per&s;on, above that which is due to the lea&s;t &s;in; is to con&s;i&s;t in torment. Why then might not the con&s;titution have been, that the &s;mall additional part of the cur&s;e, which is to con&s;i&s;t in annihila|tion, &s;hould likewi&s;e be inflicted in torment? This was very fea&s;ible. He who &s;uffers the puni&s;hment of ninety nine &s;ins in torment, might by a &s;mall addition, in degree or dura|tion to his torment, have &s;uffered the puni&s;hment of an hundred &s;ins. Add to the torment of every &s;inner dying impenitent, a degree or duration of mi&s;ery, equal to that which is de&s;erved by one &s;in, and that the lea&s;t, and there would have been no need that any of them be annihilated, but having &s;uffered the whole cur&s;e of the law, they would on the foot of &s;trict ju&s;tice be entitled to exemption from further puni&s;hment. And who having by mi&s;ery &s;atisfied

for all the various and mo&s;t aggravated &s;ins of his life, would not choo&s;e to &s;atisfy, in the &s;ame way, for the lea&s;t of all his &s;ins, rather than to be &s;truck out of exi&s;tence, and to lo&s;e inconceivable and endle&s;s enjoyment? As therefore this &s;uppo&s;ed con&s;titution would be &s;o apparently unnece&s;&s;ary and unwi&s;e, it cannot be expected to obtain credit, unle&s;s it be mo&s;t clearly revealed in &s;cripture, which is not pretend|ed concerning it.&mdash;Be&s;ides, this hypothe&s;is places &s;o &s;mall a part of the puni&s;hment of &s;inners in annihilation, that it cannot with any propriety be &s;aid, that the cur&s;e of the law con&s;i&s;ts in annihilation.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be further objected, that though all the wick|ed be annihilated, yet their puni&s;hment may be of different degrees, as the lo&s;&s;es they &s;hall re&s;pectively &s;uffer, will be different according to their various degrees of enjoyment or capacities for enjoyment: it may be an&s;wered, that the wicked are to be puni&s;hed according to their &s;everal crimes. A man guilty of murder, will, if his other crimes be the &s;ame, be puni&s;hed more than the thief, who &s;teals the va|lue of five &s;hillings. Yet the enjoyment of the latter and his capacity for enjoyment, may be far greater than tho&s;e of the former. By annihilation therefore he would &s;uffer a far greater lo&s;s.&mdash;Not all tho&s;e who know their ma&s;|ter's will, and yet commit things worthy of &s;tripes, po&s;&s;e&s;s greater enjoyments or capacities for enjoyment, than tho&s;e who know not their ma&s;ter's will.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE puni&s;hment of the fallen angels does not con&s;i&s;t in annihilation: and the damned &s;uffer the &s;ame kind of puni&s;hment with them. That the fallen angels are as yet annihilated, I pre&s;ume, will be pretended by no believer in divine revelation, and that they are not to be annihila|ted, will be evident, if we con&s;ider, that in expectation of that full puni&s;hment, to which they are liable, they a&s;ked our Lord, whether he were come to <HI>torment</HI> them before the time. It was <HI>torment</HI> then, not annihilation, which they expected. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of the fallen angels is a &s;tate of torment to a certain degree. They "believe and <HI>tremble</HI>:" "They are re&s;erved in chains under darkne&s;s, to the judgment of the great day," Jude, 6: "They are ca&s;t down to hell," 2 Peter, II, 4: "The devil that de|ceived them, was ca&s;t into the lake of fire and brim&s;tone, where the bea&s;t and the fal&s;e prophet <HI>are,</HI> and [they] &s;hall be <HI>tormented</HI> day and night, forever and ever," Rev. XX, 10. This text proves,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="109" REF="022478_0114_0FB93268D6B6BA50">(1) That the devil is now, before the general judgment, in a &s;tate of torment, in the lake of fire and brim&s;tone.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;cene of which this text di&s;plays a part, is ma|nife&s;tly an exhibition of what is to take place before the gene|ral judgment. This is evident from the context.</NOTE> And it appears from the que&s;tion, which he put to our Lord, to which reference was ju&s;t now had, that he anxi|ou&s;ly dreads the removal, which he is to &s;uffer, from this his pre&s;ent &s;tate, to that in which he is to be after the ge|neral judgment, and to which he and his angels, are re|&s;erved in chains. But can we &s;uppo&s;e, that he would anxi|ou&s;ly dread a deliverance by annihilation, out of the lake of torment by fire and brim&s;tone? This would imply, that endle&s;s annihilation is more to be dreaded, than the endle&s;s torment which is the &s;ubject of this controver&s;y. If &s;o, Dr. C. ought to have dropped all objections to the ju&s;tice of endle&s;s torments, &s;ince he allowed that the annihilation of the wicked would be ju&s;t. And if that be ju&s;t, then al|&s;o endle&s;s continuance in the lake of fire and brim&s;tone, which is the utmo&s;t puni&s;hment that any man holds concer|ning the wicked, and which is now &s;uppo&s;ed to be a le&s;s puni&s;hment than annihilation, is ju&s;t.&mdash;But if it be grant|ed, that annihilation is not &s;o great a puni&s;hment as end|le&s;s continuance in the lake of fire and brim&s;tone; it is as ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the devils &s;hould dread or tremble at the pro&s;pect of annihilation, as that a man tormented with the gout or &s;tone, &s;hould dread or tremble at an a&s;|&s;urance, that he &s;hould ere long be delivered from his tor|tures, and in their &s;tead &s;hould &s;uffer the prick of a pin.</P>
<P N="2">(2) THAT text directly proves, that the devil is to be <HI>for|ever</HI> tormented, and not annihilated. "And <HI>they,</HI>" [the nominative to be &s;upplied] "&s;hall be tormented forever and ever."&mdash;To &s;ay that this means, that the devil will be fir&s;t tormented for ages of ages, and then be annihilated, leads into the ab&s;urdities before noticed.</P>
<P>BUT to this &s;tate of torment, in which the fallen angels are, and are to be, the wicked &s;hall be &s;ent. "Depart ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." "The devil that deceived them, was ca&s;t into the lake of fire and brim&s;tone, <HI>where</HI> the bea&s;t and the fal&s;e prophet are." And as the devil is not to be annihilated, but puni&s;hed with torments, &s;o are the wicked.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="110" REF="022478_0115_0FB93269B19F9148">4. ROM. IX, 22, affords an argument pertinent to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. The words are, "What if God willing to &s;hew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long &s;uffering, the ve&s;&s;els of wrath fitted to de|&s;truction." One end it &s;eems of permitting &s;inners to pro|ceed to &s;uch lengths in &s;in, is to make known the divine power in their de&s;truction. But annihilation is no exertion of power, it is a mere &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of power.&mdash;The words imply further, that the longer God endures with the wick|ed, the greater will be the manife&s;tation of both his <HI>wrath</HI> and <HI>power</HI> in their de&s;truction. But as annihilation is the &s;ame to every per&s;on annihilated, it exhibits no greater manife&s;tation of power towards one than towards another. And if it were a manife&s;tation of power, there would be no greater manife&s;tation of power in the annihilation of one, than of another. It is pre&s;umed, that no unbia&s;&s;ed judge will &s;ay, that the meaning is, that God endures, <HI>with much long-&s;uffering</HI> the ve&s;&s;els of wrath, to di&s;play his wrath and power <HI>in their annihilation</HI>; as the very &s;ame di&s;play of both would be made, without any long-&s;uffer|ing.</P>
<P>THE only con&s;ideration urged from &s;cripture in &s;upport of the &s;entiment, which I am oppo&s;ing, is the application of the words, <HI>death, de&s;truction, peri&s;h, corruption,</HI> &amp;c. to the puni&s;hment of the wicked.&mdash;This however came with a very ill grace from Dr. C. who under&s;tood, and was ne|ce&s;&s;itated by his &s;cheme of univer&s;al &s;alvation, to under&s;tand, tho&s;e words to mean mi&s;ery, as I have already &s;hown.&mdash; With regard to others, who make not this conce&s;&s;ion, let them, if they believe in revelation, (and with &s;uch only I di&s;pute) reconcile the &s;criptures with them&s;elves, and un|der&s;tand &s;uch like pa&s;&s;ages as tho&s;e I have quoted above, repre&s;enting the puni&s;hment of the damned, to con&s;i&s;t in mi&s;ery, in any con&s;i&s;tence with the threatening of <HI>death, de&s;truction,</HI> &amp;c, otherwi&s;e than by allowing that tho&s;e words do mean po&s;itive mi&s;ery. But to allow this, is to give up the &s;cheme of annihilation; or at lea&s;t this argu|ment for it.</P>
<P>BESIDES, the &s;criptures them&s;elves explain their own meaning in the u&s;e of the words <HI>death, de&s;truction,</HI> &amp;c. The &s;econd death is expre&s;sly &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in being ca&s;t into the lake of fire and brim&s;tone, and in having a part in that lake; which is not a de&s;cription of annihilation, nor

can be reconciled with it. Rev. XX, 14. Ch. XXI, 8.&mdash; Mat. XXIV, 51, "And &s;hall cut him a&s;under, and appoint him his portion with hypocrites, there &s;hall be wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth." To divide a man into two parts, as determinately expre&s;&s;es annihilation, as the words <HI>death, perdition,</HI> &amp;c. This however the &s;cripture &s;uppo&s;es to be con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of mi&s;ery, expre&s;&s;ed by wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth. Gen. V, 24. "Enoch walked with God, and <HI>was not,</HI> for God took him." In this in&s;tance, though the &s;cripture &s;ays, Enoch <HI>was not,</HI> which more di|rectly expre&s;&s;es annihilation, than <HI>death, de&s;truction,</HI> &amp;c, yet it explains it&s;elf to mean not annihilation; indeed no man pretends that the righteous are annihilated.&mdash;When the &s;criptures &s;ay, that men are <HI>dead</HI> in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, no man under&s;tands the expre&s;&s;ion to mean annihilation. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the apo&s;tle's words in 1 Tim. V, 6. "She that liveth in plea&s;ure is <HI>dead</HI> while &s;he liveth."</P>
<P>THEREFORE, &s;ince the &s;criptures do often u&s;e the word <HI>death,</HI> &amp;c. to &s;ignify &s;omething entirely different from a ce&s;|&s;ation of life or of exi&s;tence; and &s;ince we cannot make the &s;criptures con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, unle&s;s we under|&s;tand the &s;ame words in the &s;ame latitude, when applied to the puni&s;hment of the wicked, we are nece&s;&s;itated to un|der&s;tand them in that latitude.</P>
<P N="2">II. As I ob&s;erved, there is another &s;en&s;e in which an|nihilation may be holden, and was holden by Dr. C. which is this; that though annihilation will not actually be inflicted on any man, yet it is the cur&s;e which was ori|ginally in the divine law denounced again&s;t &s;in; but that Chri&s;t hath ab&s;olutely redeemed all men from that cur&s;e, &s;o that no man is now liable to it.

<P>ON this hypothe&s;is, the puni&s;hment actually &s;uffered by the damned is no part of the cur&s;e of the divine law, but merely a nece&s;&s;ary and whole&s;ome di&s;cipline de&s;igned for the good of the patients. But this &s;cheme of annihilation can, no more than the former, be reconciled with the &s;cripture, which &s;ays the wicked &s;hall receive according to their works, &s;hall pay the uttermo&s;t farthing, &s;hall have judgment without mercy, wrath without mixture, &amp;c. Nor indeed can it be reconciled with Dr. C's book, which &s;ays, The wicked will be puni&s;hed according to their de|&s;erts, according to their &s;ins, according to the nature and number of their crimes and evil deeds: and &s;o that the law will have its cour&s;e, and the threatened penalty will be executed on &s;ome of them at lea&s;t. The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions certainly declare, that they will &s;uffer the full cur&s;e of the divine law. Otherwi&s;e the cur&s;e of the law is a greater puni&s;hment than that which is according to the de&s;erts of the wicked, and greater too than the full penalty threat|ened in the law; which is ab&s;urd and contradictory.</P>
<P>HERE I might repeat the various arguments urged in the third chapter, to prove that the puni&s;hment of the damned is not a mere &s;alutary di&s;cipline. But to avoid re|petition, I beg leave to refer the reader to the con&s;idera|tions there &s;ugge&s;ted: and to proceed to other con&s;idera|tions, which may further &s;how, that the future puni&s;h|ment of the wicked is not di&s;ciplinary, and that Chri&s;t hath not &s;o redeemed all men from annihilation, that no man is now liable to it, if indeed that be the cur&s;e of the law.</P>
<P N="1">1. IF annihilation be the cur&s;e of the divine law, and the torments of hell be a mere &s;alutary di&s;cipline; then there is no forgivene&s;s in exempting a &s;inner from tho&s;e torments. To forgive a &s;inner is to exempt or relea&s;e him from the cur&s;e of the law; not to excu&s;e him from a
<PB N="113" REF="022478_0118_0FB93274EB1403E0">
&s;alutary mean of grace. If a phy&s;ician excu&s;e his patient from an emetic or from the cold bath, no man will pre|tend, that he exerci&s;es forgiving grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. I WISH the reader to attend to Gal. III. 10;
<Q>For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the cur&s;e: for it is written cur&s;ed is every one that con|tinueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them.</Q>
This proves that all men are not ab&s;o|lutely delivered from the cur&s;e of the law, whether that cur&s;e con&s;i&s;t in annihilation, or mi&s;ery temporary or endle&s;s: becau&s;e &s;ome men are evidently &s;uppo&s;ed in this text, to be expo&s;ed to that cur&s;e.
<Q>As many as are of the works of the law,</Q>
as doubtle&s;s many of the Jews of that day were, are expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid to be "under the cur&s;e." They therefore were not <HI>ab&s;olutely and unconditionally</HI> de|livered from that cur&s;e. But if the cur&s;e of the law be an|nihilation, and all men be unconditionally delivered by Chri&s;t from that cur&s;e, how can any man be under it?</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be &s;aid, that this text is nothing to the pur|po&s;e, becau&s;e the cur&s;e here mentioned is the cur&s;e, not of the moral, but of the ceremonial law; it may be an&s;wered, If this text, with the context &s;ay nothing of redemption from the cur&s;e of the <HI>moral</HI> law, how is it known, that Chri&s;t, according to the hypothe&s;is now under con&s;iderati|on, hath delivered all men unconditionally from annihila|tion, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the cur&s;e of the moral law? It is the 13th ver&s;e, which a&s;&s;ures us, that "Chri&s;t hath redeemed us from the cur&s;e of the law." If this mean the ceremonial law, it &s;eems, we have no a&s;&s;urance that Chri&s;t hath redeemed us from the cur&s;e of the moral law, be that annihilation or what it may; but all that Chri&s;t hath done or &s;uffered notwith&s;tanding, we are as liable to that cur&s;e, as we were before Chri&s;t undertook for us.</P>
<P>BESIDES, the cur&s;e of the law here mentioned, is the ve|ry cur&s;e mentioned in Deut. XXVII, 26, from which it is quoted. But that was not the cur&s;e of the ceremonial law, but of the moral, as every precept enumerated in that context, and to which this cur&s;e is annexed, is pure|ly moral.&mdash;Or if this cur&s;e be that to which any man is liable, who tran&s;gre&s;&s;es any precept, written in the <HI>book</HI> of the law; it will certainly include the cur&s;e of the moral law. For whether the <HI>book</HI> mentioned, be the book of Deuteronomy, or the whole Pentateuch, it con|tained
<PB N="114" REF="022478_0119_0FB9327A03FD8BA0">
the whole <HI>moral</HI> law. Therefore the cur&s;e here mentioned includes the cur&s;e of the <HI>moral</HI> law. And in|deed with re&s;pect to us under the go&s;pel, the text mu&s;t mean the moral law only, becau&s;e, as the ceremonial law is now repealed, it is no longer in exi&s;tence, and therefore is no longer contained in the book of the law.&mdash;Further, if the redemption of Chri&s;t was a redemption from the cur&s;e of the ceremonial law only; then it had no re&s;pect at all to us Gentiles, who never were under the ceremonial law; nor are we in any re&s;pect redeemed by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that this cur&s;e is oppo&s;ed by the apo&s;tle, throughout the context, to the ble&s;&s;ing of Abra|ham, as is manife&s;t by in&s;pection. But the ble&s;&s;ing of A|braham did not con&s;i&s;t in freedom from the ceremonial law. If it con&s;i&s;ted in that, the Gentiles originally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham, &s;ince they were as perfectly free from the ceremonial law, as Abraham him&s;elf. Whereas the coming of the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham on the Gentiles is &s;po|ken of as a new and adventitious ble&s;&s;ing, not as one origi|nally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them; &s;ee v. 8 and 14. The ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham is not only not &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in bare freedom from the ceremonial law, but it is po&s;itively &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in ju&s;ti|fication by faith; v. 6&mdash;10. v. 14 and 29.</P>
<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age throws light on the pre&s;ent que&s;tion in a|nother point of view. As the cur&s;e of the law is &s;et in di|rect oppo&s;ition to the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham, all who are not entitled to the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham, are of cour&s;e under the cur&s;e, and are not unconditionally re&s;cued from it by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham is common to all mankind, all being ju&s;tified and exempted from the cur&s;e of the law, as he was; let it be ob&s;erved, that Abraham obtained this ble&s;&s;ing in con&s;e|quence of faith only: and will it be pretended, that all men are now the &s;ubjects of the faith of Abraham? The apo&s;tle con&s;tantly &s;peaks of this ble&s;&s;ing as &s;u&s;pended on the condition of faith: v. 7, "They which are of faith, the &s;ame are the children of Abraham." V. 8, "The &s;cripture, fore&s;eeing that God would ju&s;tify the heathen through faith." V. 9, "They which be of faith, are ble&s;&s;ed with faithful Abraham." V. 14, "That the ble&s;|&s;ing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Je|&s;us Chri&s;t; that we might receive the promi&s;e of the &s;pirit through faith." V. 29, "If ye be Chri&s;t's, then
<PB N="115" REF="022478_0120_0FB9327AF5809820">
are ye Abraham's &s;eed, and heirs according to the promi&s;e." Now if faith in Chri&s;t be nece&s;&s;ary to the inheritance of the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham, and all who are not entitled to that ble&s;&s;ing, be liable to the cur&s;e of the law; then it cannot be true, that all mankind are unconditionally freed by Chri&s;t from the cur&s;e of the law, whether that cur&s;e be annihilation or any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. ON the hypothe&s;is now under con&s;ideration, what are pardon and ju&s;tification? They are every where in &s;cripture repre&s;ented to be conditional, &s;u&s;pended on the conditions of repentance and faith; and the &s;ame is abun|dantly holden by Dr. C. however incon&s;i&s;tently with his other tenet concerning the unconditional exemption of all men from the cur&s;e of the law. The language of &s;crip|ture is, He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that be|lieveth not, &s;hall be damned. He that believeth not is con|demned already&mdash;the wrath of God abideth on him, &amp;c, &amp;c. How can tho&s;e be <HI>condemned,</HI> and how can the <HI>wrath of God abide</HI> on tho&s;e, who are unconditionally delivered from the cur&s;e of the law? Pardon is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to con|&s;i&s;t in an acquittance from the cur&s;e of the law: but if all men, penitent and impenitent, believing and unbelieving, be acquitted and delivered from that cur&s;e, where is the propriety or truth of limiting pardon to the penitent and believing, and of declaring, that all the re&s;t of men are con|demned? To what are they condemned? Not to &s;uffer the cur&s;e of the law: From this they are by &s;uppo&s;ition unconditionally delivered. By what are they condemned? Not by the law: this would imply, that they are under the cur&s;e of it.</P>
<P>IF to this it be &s;aid, that the impenitent are condemned to &s;uffer the cur&s;e of the law, in this &s;en&s;e only, that the law declares the puni&s;hment to which, according to &s;trict ju&s;tice, they are liable; but not that puni&s;hment to which they are now liable, &s;ince the redemption of Chri&s;t:&mdash;To this it may be an&s;wered, In this &s;en&s;e the penitent and be|lieving are equally condemned, as the impenitent and un|believing; nay, the whole body of the &s;aints in heaven. Nor would there be any truth in &s;aying, in this &s;en&s;e, "He that believeth on Chri&s;t, is not condemned."</P>
<P N="4">4. THAT &s;ingle text, Gal V. 2, &s;eems to confute the hypothe&s;is now in que&s;tion. The words are,
<Q>If ye be circumci&s;ed, Chri&s;t &s;hall profit you nothing.</Q>
Whereas
<PB N="116" REF="022478_0121_0FB9327C838A72C8">
according to the hypothe&s;is now in que&s;tion, whether the Galatians were circumci&s;ed or not; whether they depended on their circumci&s;ion and other conformity to ceremonial in&s;titutions or not: &s;till Chri&s;t did profit them; &s;till by him was unconditionally &s;ecured to them the infinite pro|fit of e&s;cape from the cur&s;e of the law, and of an endle&s;s life of happine&s;s and glory in heaven.&mdash;</P>
<P>THIS argument is equally conclu&s;ive, whether it be &s;up|po&s;ed that Chri&s;t has unconditionally re&s;cued all men from annihilation or any other puni&s;hment. If &s;alvation be &s;e|cured to all men by Chri&s;t, then he does profit them, how|ever they be circumci&s;ed or depend on their circum|ci&s;ion.</P>
<P>BESIDE the two lights in which the doctrine of annihi|lation hath been &s;tated above, there is another in which &s;ome &s;eem to hold that doctrine; it is this, That if after God &s;hall have u&s;ed all proper means for the repentance and &s;alvation of the wicked, they &s;hall &s;till remain impeni|tent, he will annihilate them from de&s;pair of ever bring|ing them to good.&mdash;Concerning this &s;entiment it may be inquired, what then is the cur&s;e of the law? Is it an|nihilation? If &s;o, then I refer to the arguments already urged in this chapter again&s;t that idea; viz. That on that &s;uppo&s;ition endle&s;s puni&s;hment is ju&s;t: That the &s;cripture abundantly repre&s;ents the puni&s;hment of the damned to con&s;i&s;t in mi&s;ery: That the puni&s;hment of all who &s;uffer the cur&s;e of the law will be equal: That the cur&s;e of the law is the &s;ame puni&s;hment which the devils &s;uffer, which is not annihilation: That the puni&s;hment which the finally impenitent &s;hall &s;uffer, will be &s;uch, that in it God will di&s;play both his wrath and power, and greater degrees of wrath and power in the ca&s;e of tho&s;e, with re&s;pect to whom he exerci&s;es the greate&s;t long-&s;uffering: which can|not be true, if the cur&s;e of the law be annihilation, as that is not an exertion of power at all. or a di&s;play of greater wrath and power in the ca&s;e of one &s;inner than of another. If it be &s;aid, that the cur&s;e of the law is that di&s;cipline which the wicked &s;hall &s;uffer, before they be annihilated, I refer to what has been &s;aid, chap. II and III.&mdash;If it be granted that the cur&s;e of the law is endle&s;s mi&s;ery; either it mu&s;t be allowed, that endle&s;s mi&s;ery will be &s;uffered by &s;ome men; or that though endle&s;s mi&s;ery be the cur&s;e of the law, Chri&s;t hath redeemed and will &s;ave all men from
<PB N="117" REF="022478_0122_0FB9327F807C34E0">
it, by admitting &s;ome to endle&s;s happine&s;s, and by inflict|ing on others endle&s;s annihilation. With re&s;pect to this la&s;t &s;entiment, I beg leave to refer to the con&s;iderations al|ready hinted in this chapter: and that the cur&s;e of the law, or all that puni&s;hment which the wicked ju&s;tly de|&s;erve, whether it con&s;i&s;t in endle&s;s mi&s;ery or any thing el&s;e, will actually be inflicted, hath been attempted to be proved in chap. III.</P>
<P>ON the whole; it is left with the candid and judicious to determine, whether annihilation be the cur&s;e of the law: and whether that as the cur&s;e of the law can be re|conciled with the &s;criptures, on either of the foremen|tioned hypothe&s;es.&mdash;1. That all who die in impenitence, will be annihilated, as the proper and adequate puni&s;h|ment of their &s;ins in this life.&mdash;2. That annihilation was originally the cur&s;e of the law; but that Chri&s;t hath re&s;|cued all from it.&mdash;If it &s;hall be found that annihilation in any view of it, is not the cur&s;e of the law; it will re|main, that that cur&s;e con&s;i&s;ts either in that puni&s;hment which &s;inners actually &s;uffer in hell; or in &s;ome temporary mi&s;ery greater than that which they actually &s;uffer in hell; or in endle&s;s mi&s;ery. In which of the&s;e it does con&s;i&s;t, &s;hall be farther inquired in the next chapter.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> The Ju&s;tice of endle&s;s Puni&s;hment con&s;i&s;ting in Mi&s;ery.</HEAD>
<P>ACCORDING to what was propo&s;ed in the clo&s;e of the la&s;t chapter, I am to inquire in the fir&s;t place, Whe|ther the cur&s;e of the law, or the puni&s;hment which in the divine law is threatened again&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, con&s;i&s;t in that puni&s;hment which the wicked will actually &s;uffer in hell.&mdash; That this cannot be the cur&s;e of the law, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that all men are to be &s;aved, appears at fir&s;t blu&s;h from this con&s;ideration, that &s;ome men will actually &s;uffer that puni&s;hment: and if that puni&s;hment be the cur&s;e of the law, &s;ome men will be damned and not &s;aved. For &s;alva|tion con&s;i&s;ts in deliverance from tho cur&s;e of the law. "Chri&s;t hath redeemed us from the cur&s;e of the law:" and all who are &s;aved, are &s;aved by the redemption of
<PB N="118" REF="022478_0123_0FB93281039B8DB0">
Chri&s;t, which is a redemption from the cur&s;e of the law. But &s;ince all men are not &s;aved from that puni&s;hment which a great part actually &s;uffer in hell; it is ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that that puni&s;hment is the cur&s;e of the law from which Chri&s;t hath redeemed and will &s;ave all men.</P>
<P>I MEAN not now to enter into any di&s;pute concerning the nature of Chri&s;t's redemption. It is &s;ufficient for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to take for granted no more, than is grant|ed by all chri&s;tians, that all who are &s;aved, are &s;aved &s;ome how by and through Chri&s;t. This is abundantly a&s;&s;erted in the various works of Dr. C. But neither has he pretended nor will any other advocate for univer&s;al &s;alvation pre|tend, that the puni&s;hment which is actually to be &s;uffered by a great part of mankind in hell, is the cur&s;e of the law from which Chri&s;t is to &s;ave <HI>all men</HI>: becau&s;e by the very terms a great part of mankind are actually to &s;uffer it.</P>
<P>BESIDE; if that be the cur&s;e of the law; it is all the puni&s;hment to which the &s;inner is ju&s;tly liable. He having &s;uffered that, cannot con&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice be made to &s;uffer any further puni&s;hment; and if after that he be ex|empted from further puni&s;hment, he is exempted from it, not in the way of grace, forgivene&s;s or pardon; but en|tirely on the footing of ju&s;tice and of his own per&s;onal right. It is to be noticed however, that the go&s;pel is ig|norant of any &s;alvation of &s;inners, except in the way of grace and forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>IF the puni&s;hment actually to be &s;uffered in hell be the cur&s;e of the law, then the damned in their deliverance out of hell, and exemption from further puni&s;hment, experi|ence no &s;alvation at all. They are delivered from nothing to which they are or ever were expo&s;ed. We might as well &s;ay, that the mo&s;t innocent citizen in the &s;tate <HI>is &s;aved from the gallows,</HI> when he hath neither committed any crime, nor is accu&s;ed of any.&mdash;The very idea of &s;alvation is deliverance from the cur&s;e of the law. But if the pains of hell for ages of ages be the cur&s;e of the law, they who &s;uffer tho&s;e pains, are not &s;aved; they are damned to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree con&s;i&s;tent with law and ju&s;tice; which is all the damnation for which any man can argue.</P>
<P>ON the whole, I conclude, that the idea, that the cur&s;e of the law con&s;i&s;ts in the puni&s;hment, which the damned are actually to &s;uffer in hell, is totally irreconcileable with the &s;alvation of all men.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="022478_0124_0FB93283F467BDB0">IN the next place we are to inquire, whether the cur&s;e of the law con&s;i&s;t in &s;ome temporary puni&s;hment, which is of greater duration than that which is &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to the puni&s;hment which the damned &s;hall actually &s;uffer. If the cur&s;e of the law be a temporary puni&s;hment of great|er duration than that which is actually to be &s;uffered by the damned; that more la&s;ting temporary puni&s;hment is doubt|le&s;s threatened in the law. Doubtle&s;s the cur&s;e of the law is the cur&s;e threatened in law: the very terms imply this. Now, where in all the law, or in all the &s;cripture, is threat|ened any puni&s;hment of greater duration, than that which in the &s;acred dialect is &s;aid to be <HI>everla&s;ting, forever, forever and ever,</HI> &amp;c? But all the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are on all hands allowed to be applied in &s;cripture to the puni&s;hment which the damned &s;hall actually &s;uffer. Unle&s;s therefore &s;ome longer puni&s;hment can be found threatened in &s;cripture, than that which is &s;aid to be <HI>forever and ever,</HI> &amp;c, it cannot be pretended, that the cur&s;e of the law is a temporary pu|ni&s;hment of greater duration, than that which is actually to be &s;uffered by the damned. But no puni&s;hment of great|er duration, whether temporary or endle&s;s, than that which the damned are con&s;tantly declared to &s;uffer, can be pointed out from any part of &s;cripture. Therefore the cur&s;e of the law is not a temporary puni&s;hment of greater duration, than that which is to be &s;uffered by the damn|ed.</P>
<P>NOW, if this train of rea&s;oning be ju&s;t, if the cur&s;e of the divine law be neither annihilation, nor (on the &s;uppo|&s;ition of the &s;alvation of all men) that mi&s;ery which the damned are actually to &s;uffer; nor a temporary mi&s;ery of greater duration; the con&s;equence is inevitable, that it is endle&s;s mi&s;ery. No other hypothe&s;is &s;eems to be conceiva|ble. The law certainly threatens &s;ome puni&s;hment. This puni&s;hment mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t either in annihilation, or in &s;ome|thing el&s;e. If it con&s;i&s;t in &s;omething el&s;e, that &s;omething mu&s;t be either temporary or endle&s;s mi&s;ery. If it be tem|porary mi&s;ery, it mu&s;t be either a mi&s;ery of &s;horter dura|tion than that which is to be &s;uffered by the damned; or that very mi&s;ery which is to be &s;uffered by the damned; or a temporary mi&s;ery of longer duration. That the cur&s;e of the law is a mi&s;ery of &s;horter duration than that which is to be &s;uffered by the damned, no man will pretend; as this would imply that the damned will &s;uffer a greater pu|ni&s;hment
<PB N="120" REF="022478_0125_0FB93285908A96B0">
than was ever threatened, and than is ju&s;t. And that the cur&s;e of the law is neither the very mi&s;ery to be &s;uffered by the damned, nor a temporary mi&s;ery of longer duration, I have endeavoured to prove, and &s;ubmit the proof to the candid and judicious. If the proof &s;hall be found to be good, we are driven to the conclu&s;ion, that the cur&s;e of the divine law is endle&s;s mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>IF then it be an e&s;tabli&s;hed point, that endle&s;s mi&s;ery is the cur&s;e of the divine law; the inference is immediate and nece&s;&s;ary, that the endle&s;s mi&s;ery of the &s;inner is a ju&s;t puni&s;hment of his &s;in. It is impo&s;&s;ible that a God of inviolable and infinite ju&s;tice &s;hould threaten in his law an unju&s;t puni&s;hment. A law containing &s;uch a threatening, is an unju&s;t law; and an unju&s;t law can never be enacted by a legi&s;lator of perfect ju&s;tice.&mdash;It is in vain to &s;ay, that God will never execute the law. To make an unju&s;t law, is as really irreconcileable with ju&s;tice, as to execute it. What &s;hould we think of a human prince who &s;hould enact a law, that whoever &s;hould walk acro&s;s his neighbour's ground without his con&s;ent, &s;hould die on the gallows. I pre|&s;ume no man would pretend, that the forbearance of the prince to execute the law, would &s;ave his character from abhorrence and contempt.</P>
<P>AGAIN; If all men &s;hall be &s;aved, they will be &s;aved from &s;omething, from &s;ome puni&s;hment. That puni&s;h|ment mu&s;t be either temporary or endle&s;s. If it be tem|porary, it mu&s;t be either that puni&s;hment, which is to be endured by the damned, or a longer temporary puni&s;h|ment. But for rea&s;ons already given, it can be neither of the&s;e. Therefore it mu&s;t be an endle&s;s puni&s;hment. But if all men be &s;aved from an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, they were expo&s;ed to an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, and expo&s;ed to it by a divine con&s;titution, and therefore an endle&s;s puni&s;hment is ju&s;t; otherwi&s;e it could not have been appointed by God.</P>
<P>IF all men &s;hall be &s;aved, they are redeemed by Chri&s;t, and they are redeemed by him from &s;ome puni&s;hment. That puni&s;hment is either temporary or endle&s;s. If it be temporary, it is either the puni&s;hment which the damned &s;hall actually &s;uffer, or a longer temporary puni&s;hment. But for rea&s;ons already given it is neither of the&s;e. There|fore, it is an endle&s;s puni&s;hment. Therefore they were expo&s;ed to an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, and that puni&s;hment is ju&s;t. Surely no Chri&s;tian will pretend, that our Lord Je|&s;us
<PB N="121" REF="022478_0126_0FB9328C9E897D58">
Chri&s;t came to redeem and &s;ave us from a puni&s;hment to which we never were expo&s;ed, and which the very ju&s;|tice of God would never permit him to inflict.</P>
<P>IF endle&s;s puni&s;hment be unju&s;t, it &s;eems that Chri&s;t came to &s;ave mankind from an unju&s;t puni&s;hment; a pu|ni&s;hment, to which they were not ju&s;tly liable, and which could not be inflicted on them con&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice. But what an idea does this give us of God? It implies, that he had made an unju&s;t law, denouncing an unju&s;t pe|nalty; that having made this law, he was determined to execute it, till Chri&s;t came and prevented him.</P>
<P>IF all men &s;hall be &s;aved, and &s;hall be &s;aved in the way of grace, favour, pardon or forgivene&s;s; then it would be ju&s;t, that they &s;hould not be &s;aved. If their deliverance im|ply grace and forgivene&s;s, then it would be ju&s;t, that they &s;hould not be delivered, and that they &s;hould &s;uffer that puni&s;hment from which they are delivered. But for rea|&s;ons already given, if all men &s;hall be &s;aved, they &s;hall be &s;aved from an endle&s;s puni&s;hment. And to be &s;aved from an endle&s;s puni&s;hment not on the footing of ju&s;tice, but by mere grace and forgivene&s;s, implies, that the infliction of endle&s;s puni&s;hment would be ju&s;t. Surely to liberate a per&s;on from an unju&s;t puni&s;hment, is no act of forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>ALL the a&s;criptions of prai&s;e, and all hymns of thank&s;|giving &s;ung by the &s;aved on account of their &s;alvation, prove, that it would have been ju&s;t, that they &s;hould not be &s;aved. If God in delivering all men from endle&s;s pu|ni&s;hment, be worthy of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving, it would have been ju&s;t, if he had not delivered them from it. A mere act of ju&s;tice, which the object of it may demand on the footing of his per&s;onal right, does not infer, an obli|gation to any great prai&s;e or thank&s;giving. No man con|ceives him&s;elf bound very much to prai&s;e another for gi|ving him his due, or for not injuring him, or for not pu|ni&s;hing him, when he de&s;erves no puni&s;hment. But the only puni&s;hment, from which God delivers all men, on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that all are to be &s;aved, is an endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment, as was &s;hewn before. Therefore, unle&s;s endle&s;s pu|ni&s;hment be ju&s;t, there is no foundation for prai&s;e and thank&s;giving for the &s;alvation of all men.</P>
<P>IF endle&s;s puni&s;hment be unju&s;t, then God was bound in ju&s;tice to &s;ave all men from it, and could no more fail of granting this &s;alvation, than he could deny him&s;elf: and
<PB N="122" REF="022478_0127_0FB9328DACE24BA0">
he was bound in ju&s;tice to do whatever was nece&s;&s;ary to that &s;alvation, and if that &s;alvation could not be di&s;pen&s;ed, but in con&s;equence of the incarnation and death of Chri&s;t; then unle&s;s God had given his &s;on to become incarnate and to die, he would have committed inju&s;tice. So that on this plan, the very gift of Chri&s;t, of the go&s;pel, and of all the means of grace, are mere acts of ju&s;tice, and not of grace or favour: and the revelation of the go&s;pel or of the &s;alvation of all men is no gracious communication, but a communication made entirely on the foundation of ju&s;tice. For &s;urely it is but an act of ju&s;tice to tell mankind, if there be any need of telling them, that God will not injure them, and &s;o pre&s;erve them from the tormenting fear of injury from the hand of God. To have kept them with|out the nece&s;&s;ary means of knowing this, would have &s;a|voured of cruelty.&mdash;Yet according to the &s;criptures the forementioned divine acts and communications are no acts of ju&s;tice, but of free and infinite grace.</P>
<P>IF endle&s;s puni&s;hment be unju&s;t, it is hard to imagine of what advantage the mediation and redemption of Chri&s;t is to all mankind. Dr. C. &s;peaking of his own &s;cheme of univer&s;al &s;alvation, &s;ays,
<Q>Nor is there any &s;cheme that &s;o illu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ets forth the powerful efficacy and ex|ten&s;ive advantage of the mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If mankind univer&s;ally are the objects of his concern, if he died for them all, if he a&s;cended up to heaven for them all, if he is there acting on their behalf, and managing all things in the kingdom of grace, with a view to their &s;alvation, and will not give up his mini&s;try in this king|dom, till he has actually accompli&s;hed this great de&s;ign, and in&s;tated the whole human kind in eternal glory, what more noble idea can we form of his undertaking for us?</Q>
&amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 14.</NOTE> What is "the powerful efficacy and ex|ten&s;ive advantage of the mediation of Chri&s;t," with regard to tho&s;e, who &s;uffer for ages of ages, as Dr. C. allows &s;ome men do? Is "the powerful efficacy and exten&s;ive advan|tage of Chri&s;t's mediation" "illu&s;triou&s;ly &s;et forth" in de|livering them from an unju&s;t puni&s;hment? is the idea, that Chri&s;t came to &s;ave them from a puni&s;hment, which they do not de&s;erve, "the mo&s;t noble idea we can form of his undertaking?" Tho&s;e who are &s;aved by Chri&s;t, without &s;uffering the torments of hell, do indeed derive &s;ome ad|vantage
<PB N="123" REF="022478_0128_0FB93290E717C060">
from the mediation of Chri&s;t. But this is no great|er advantage than is derived from Chri&s;t, according to the &s;cheme of tho&s;e, who believe in endle&s;s puni&s;hment. They hold, that all who are pre&s;erved from hell, are pre&s;erved from it by Chri&s;t. But what advantage do tho&s;e men de|rive from Chri&s;t's mediation, who pa&s;s through the torments of hell, and are not &s;aved, till they have been puni&s;hed for ages of ages? To &s;ay that they are re&s;cued by Chri&s;t from endle&s;s mi&s;ery, is either to give up the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, and to allow that endle&s;s mi&s;ery is ju&s;t: or it is to give up the moral rectitude of the divine character, and to hold, that God has threatened, and was about to inflict, an un|ju&s;t puni&s;hment.&mdash;To &s;ay, that the advantage, which they derive from Chri&s;t, is that they are re&s;cued from a temporary puni&s;hment, which is longer than forever and ever, is to &s;ay, that for which there is no foundation, as no &s;uch puni&s;hment is threatened or mentioned in &s;cripture. So that in any ca&s;e, if endle&s;s puni&s;hment be unju&s;t, it is im|po&s;&s;ible to imagine, of what advantage the mediation and redemption of Chri&s;t is to all mankind.</P>
<P>THE <HI>hope</HI> of the go&s;pel implies that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is ju&s;t. On the plan of univer&s;al &s;alvation, all men are en|couraged to <HI>hope</HI> that they &s;hall be delivered from &s;ome puni&s;hment. Dr. C. applies Rom. VIII. 20, to all men, and &s;uppo&s;es that they are all &s;ubjected to vanity <HI>in hope</HI> of "deliverance from the bondage of corruption," and from "the final con&s;equences" of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 106, 119.</NOTE> That is, all men have a ground to hope, that they &s;hall be at la&s;t delivered from &s;in and its puni&s;hment. This puni&s;hment as we have &s;een, can be no other than an endle&s;s puni&s;hment. But that God encourages us to hope, that we may e&s;cape endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment, as clearly implies that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is ju&s;t, as his encouraging us to hope, that he will never leave us nor for&s;ake us in this life, implies that it would be ju&s;t, if he &s;hould leave us. If endle&s;s puni&s;hment be not ju&s;t, then God encourages us to hope, that he will not injure us, will not rob us of our rights or tyrannize over us! The very idea of hope in this ca&s;e, implies &s;ome danger that God will injure us; however that there is a po&s;&s;ibility, and therefore a foundation to <HI>hope,</HI> that he will not injure us.</P>
<P>IF endle&s;s puni&s;hment be unju&s;t, we are as &s;ure, that it will never be inflicted, as we are of the ju&s;tice of God, or
<PB N="124" REF="022478_0129_0FB932956408B758">
as we are, that the judge of all the earth will do right. But are we ever encouraged in &s;cripture barely to <HI>hope,</HI> that the judge of all the earth will do right?&mdash;What if a &s;ubject who has always entirely conformed to the laws of his prince and is con&s;cious of his own innocence, and al&s;o knows that his prince is fully informed of it, &s;hould &s;ay, that he <HI>hopes</HI> his prince will not order him to be executed as a felon? This would certainly imply great diffidence in the ju&s;tice of his prince, and would be a high reflection on his character. Much more is it a reflection on the cha|racter of God, to expre&s;s a bare <HI>hope,</HI> that under his go|vernment, no man will be puni&s;hed with an unju&s;t puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>THE <HI>promi&s;es</HI> of the go&s;pel appear to be a further proof of the ju&s;tice of endle&s;s puni&s;hment. They are promi&s;es of deliverance from &s;ome puni&s;hment. If there be any pro|mi&s;es of the &s;alvation of all men, they are not promi&s;es that all &s;hall wholly e&s;cape the puni&s;hment of hell. Dr. C. and others grant, that &s;ome men will &s;uffer that pu|ni&s;hment. Nor are they promi&s;es of e&s;cape from a longer temporary puni&s;hment, than that of hell, as there is no mention in all the &s;cripture of &s;uch a puni&s;hment. There|fore they are promi&s;es of deliverance from endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment. Therefore endle&s;s puni&s;hment is ju&s;t: otherwi&s;e the promi&s;es that God will &s;ave from it, would be ab&s;urd. The very idea, that God promi&s;es to &s;ave from endle&s;s puni&s;hment, implies that he has a right to inflict it. Do we ever find God promi&s;ing in &s;cripture, that he will not injure or tyrannize over his creatures? And are the
<Q>ex|ceeding great and precious promi&s;es,</Q>
which the apo&s;|tle Peter mentions, merely a&s;&s;urances that we &s;hall not be treated by God unju&s;tly? There would be nothing at all precious in &s;uch promi&s;es; becau&s;e they would give us no greater &s;ecurity from &s;uch injury, than we &s;hould have without them. If the bare ju&s;tice of God do not &s;ecure us from injury at his hands, neither will his veracity.&mdash; What &s;hould we think of a prince of good reputation for ju&s;tice, if he make proclamation, that he would not pu|ni&s;h any of his &s;ubjects ten times as much as they de&s;erve; and &s;hould call this an exceeding great and precious pro|mi&s;e? Whatever we might before have thought of him and of his government, we &s;hould doubtle&s;s then think that his &s;ubjects were not perfectly &s;ecure in their rights.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="022478_0130_0FB93298EE0DA088">DR. C. allows that it is our duty to pray for the &s;al|vation of all men. This appears e&s;pecially in his comment on 1 Tim. II, 4, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 163.</NOTE> But this proves the ju&s;tice of end|le&s;s puni&s;hment. If we are to pray for the &s;alvation of all men, we are to pray that they may be delivered from the cur&s;e of the law; which, as we have &s;een already, is an endle&s;s puni&s;hment. Now, to pray that God would &s;ave men from endle&s;s puni&s;hment certainly implies an acknow|ledgement of ju&s;t expo&s;ure to &s;uch puni&s;hment. Other|wi&s;e there would be as much propriety, that the angels a|round the throne of God, &s;hould pray, that they, perfectly guiltle&s;s as they are, may not be puni&s;hed with the tor|ments of hell. What if an entirely innocent and mo&s;t du|tiful &s;ubject of &s;ome earthly prince, and one who is by all acknowledged to be &s;uch, &s;hould prefer a petition to his prince, that he would not order the petitioner to the &s;take or the gallows?</P>
<P>HITHERTO the ju&s;tice of endle&s;s puni&s;hment has been con&s;idered on the ground of what I &s;uppo&s;e to be the truth, that it is de&s;erved by every &s;inner, on account of the &s;ins which he hath committed in this lite only.&mdash;There is ano|ther ground, on which it may be &s;upported, and which is equally incon&s;i&s;tent with that capital argument in favor of the &s;alvation of all men, that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is not re|concileable with ju&s;tice.&mdash;Though it were not ju&s;t, to in|flict an endle&s;s puni&s;hment for the &s;ins committed in this life only, which I by no means allow; yet there would be no inju&s;tice in &s;uffering the &s;inner to go on in &s;in, and to puni&s;h him continually and without end as he &s;ins.</P>
<P>THAT it was no inju&s;tice in God, to leave man at fir&s;t to fall into &s;in, will doubtle&s;s be granted by all, becau&s;e it is an evident fact. Now if God may without injury permit a creature to fall into &s;in to day, and puni&s;h him for it, why may he not do the &s;ame tomorrow, and &s;o on through eve|ry day or period of his exi&s;tence. And if it be ju&s;t to leave a &s;inner to endle&s;s &s;in, it is doubtle&s;s ju&s;t to inflict on him endle&s;s puni&s;hment for that endle&s;s &s;in. Therefore the endle&s;s &s;in and puni&s;hment of a creature is no more incon|&s;i&s;tent with divine ju&s;tice, than the exi&s;tence of &s;in and pu|ni&s;hment in any in&s;tance, and for ever &s;o &s;hort a duration. If it be not con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, that a &s;inner be left by God to endle&s;s impenitence; then the leading of a &s;inner
<PB N="126" REF="022478_0131_0FB9329F687F5328">
to repentance is an act of mere ju&s;tice, the payment of a debt, and not an act of grace, which is utterly irreconcile|able with the &s;criptures.&mdash;If it be not con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;|tice to leave a &s;inner to final impenitence, then God is bound in ju&s;tice, &s;ome time or other to lead every &s;inner to repentance. But when is this time? How long may God, without injury, permit the &s;inner to continue impe|nitent? If he may for one day, why not for two? for four? for eight, &amp;c. to eternity?&mdash;Though the damned &s;hould, by their &s;ufferings, fully &s;atisfy for all their pa&s;t &s;ins; yet God would be no more obliged in ju&s;tice, to lead them to repentance, or to pre&s;erve them from &s;in in future, than he was obliged to pre&s;erve them from &s;in at the time they fir&s;t fell into it: and con&s;equently he would not be ob|liged in ju&s;tice to relea&s;e them from puni&s;hment. I take it to be abundantly conceded by Dr. C. that the damned may ju&s;tly be puni&s;hed till they repent. Therefore if they ne|ver repent they may ju&s;tly be puni&s;hed without end</P>
<P>NOW, that our advocate for univer&s;al &s;alvation, may e&s;|tabli&s;h his favorite propo&s;ition, that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is not reconcileable with divine ju&s;tice; he mu&s;t &s;how, that it is not con&s;i&s;tent with divine ju&s;tice, to leave a &s;inner to proceed without end in his own cho&s;en cour&s;e of &s;in, and to puni&s;h him daily for his daily &s;ins. Till he &s;hall have done this, it will be in vain for him to plead, that tho&s;e who die in impenitence, will all finally be &s;aved, becau&s;e endle&s;s puni&s;hment is not reconcileable with the ju&s;tice of God.</P>
<P>IF after all, any man will in&s;i&s;t, that endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment is not reconcileable with divine ju&s;tice? he ought fairly to an&s;wer the preceding rea&s;oning, and to &s;how that the cur&s;e of the divine law from which Chri&s;t hath re|deemed us, is either annihilation, or that mi&s;ery which the damned are actually to &s;uffer; or a longer temporary mi&s;ery. He ought to &s;how further, that Chri&s;t came to deliver all men from &s;ome other puni&s;hment, than that which is endle&s;s; or that it is reconcileable with the cha|racter of God to refu&s;e to relea&s;e man from an unju&s;t pu|ni&s;hment, without the mediation of his &s;on: that deliver|ance from unju&s;t puni&s;hment is an act of free grace, pardon, or forgivene&s;s: that deliverance from an unju&s;t pu|ni&s;hment is a proper ground of extatic and everla&s;ting prai&s;e and thank&s;giving to God. That the very mi&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="127" REF="022478_0132_0FB932A06E740760">
Chri&s;t, the in&s;titution of the go&s;pel and of any means ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the deliverance of &s;inners from endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment, can be con&s;idered as gracious gifts and in&s;titutions, on any other &s;uppo&s;ition than that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is ju&s;t. He ought al&s;o to &s;how, of what advantage the me|diation of Chri&s;t is to tho&s;e who &s;uffer in hell for ages of ages; and how the <HI>hope</HI> and the <HI>promi&s;es</HI> of the go&s;pel, and how <HI>praying</HI> for the &s;alvation of all men, can be re|conciled with the idea, that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is unju&s;t, and finally, that it is unju&s;t, that God &s;hould leave a &s;inner to perpetual &s;in, and to puni&s;h him perpetually for that &s;in.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be but an act of ju&s;tice to Dr. C. to repeat here, what I noticed before, that he him&s;elf, whether con|&s;i&s;tently or not, does acknowledge the ju&s;tice of endle&s;s pu|ni&s;hment: as in the&s;e words:
<Q>If the next &s;tate is a &s;tate of puni&s;hment, not intended for the cure of the pa|tients them&s;elves, but to <HI>&s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of God,</HI> and give warning to others, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible all men &s;hould be finally &s;aved.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 11.</NOTE> This is a plain declaration, that a &s;tate, in which all &s;alvation, and all po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation, are excluded, no more than &s;atisfies ju&s;tice, or is no more than ju&s;t.&mdash;The &s;ame is confe&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e many pa&s;&s;ages of this and the other works of Dr. C. wherein he has po|&s;itively a&s;&s;erted, that man cannot be "ju&s;tified on the foot of mere law," of "rigid law" &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 34, 36, 43, &amp;c.</NOTE> He would not deny, that the law of God is ju&s;t, perfectly ju&s;t. If therefore we cannot be ju&s;tified on the foot of the divine law, we mu&s;t on that foot be finally condemned, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be finally condemned on the foot of ju&s;tice. There|fore the final or endle&s;s condemnation of the wicked is en|tirely ju&s;t. The ju&s;t law of God him&s;elf condemns them: and if that law, "mere law," "rigid law," be executed, they mu&s;t be condemned to an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, and can|not po&s;&s;ibly be ju&s;tified or &s;aved. So long therefore as the divine law is ju&s;t, &s;o long, according to the conce&s;&s;ion of Dr. C. the endle&s;s condemnation and mi&s;ery of the wicked are ju&s;t.&mdash;There &s;eems to be no way to avoid this con&s;e|quence, but by holding that the cur&s;e of the law, and the puni&s;hment which "&s;atisfies ju&s;tice," are annihilation, with re&s;pect to which &s;entiment, I mu&s;t refer the reader back to Chap. V. But how incon&s;i&s;tent it is, to hold, that endle&s;s puni&s;hment, whether con&s;i&s;ting in annihilation, or
<PB N="128" REF="022478_0133_0FB932A3DF7C0348">
mi&s;ery, is no more than &s;atisfactory to ju&s;tice; and at the &s;ame time to hold, that the wicked in temporary pains in hell, &s;uffer according to their de&s;erts, and endure the whole penalty of the law, cannot e&s;cape the notice of any atten|tive reader.&mdash;Or will it be &s;aid, that the Doctor held a <HI>commutation</HI> of puni&s;hment? that endle&s;s annihilation is <HI>commuted</HI> for temporary mi&s;ery? If &s;o, then temporary mi|&s;ery is the cur&s;e of the divine law now inflicted in <HI>commu|tation</HI> for endle&s;s annihilation; and our author was entire|ly mi&s;taken in a doctrine abundantly taught in all his wri|tings, that, "by law," "mere law," "rigid law," no man can be ju&s;tified or &s;aved.</P>
<P>AS a corollary from the whole of the preceding rea&s;on|ing concerning the ju&s;tice of endle&s;s puni&s;hment, may I not &s;afely a&s;&s;ert, what was mo&s;t grievous to Dr. C. and is &s;o to all other advocates for univer&s;al &s;alvation; that SIN IS AN INFINITE EVIl? If every &s;inner do, on account of &s;in, de&s;erve an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, <HI>&s;in</HI> is an infinite evil: that is all that is meant by the infinite evil of &s;in.&mdash;There|fore if any man deny the infinite evil of &s;in, let him prove, that it does not de&s;erve an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, and let him an&s;wer the preceding rea&s;oning to evince the ju&s;tice of end|le&s;s puni&s;hment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this chapter it was often more convenient for me, on &s;everal accounts, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>endle&s;s puni&s;hment,</HI> than that of <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery.</HI> Still the reader will perceive, that the latter is my meaning. The rea&s;ons had been given in the preceding chapter, why the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the damned cannot be annihilation.</NOTE></P>
<P>PERHAPS &s;ome may object, that &s;uppo&s;ing &s;in do de&s;erve an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, when it is not repented of; yet how can it de&s;erve &s;o great a puni&s;hment, when it is renounced in real repentance.&mdash;But if repentance make atonement for &s;in; if it &s;atisfy the broken law of God; if it repair the damage done to &s;ociety by &s;in; or if it &s;o far atone, that the good of the univer&s;e, comprehending the glory of the deity, though it before required, that &s;in &s;hould be puni&s;h|ed with endle&s;s puni&s;hment, now requires that it be puni&s;h|ed with a temporary puni&s;hment only: then as repentance is a &s;atisfaction made by the &s;inner him&s;elf, and makes a part of his per&s;onal character, &s;in repented of, does indeed not de&s;erve endle&s;s puni&s;hment, otherwi&s;e it does. And if repentance do make the &s;atisfaction for &s;in which has been
<PB N="129" REF="022478_0134_0FB932A51CA7C8F0">
de&s;cribed, then the &s;atisfaction or atonement of Chri&s;t is in vain, &s;ince repentance would have an&s;wered the purpo&s;e without the death and atonement of Chri&s;t. There was no need that &s;inners be redeemed by Chri&s;t, or as Dr. C. &s;ays, that he &s;hould be "the per&s;on <HI>upon who&s;e account,</HI>" and that
<Q>his obedience and death &s;hould be <HI>the ground or rea&s;on</HI> upon which happine&s;s &s;hould be attainable by any of the race of Adam.</Q>
They might have redeem|ed them&s;elves, and by repentance have made a full &s;atis|faction or atonement for their own &s;ins, and thus might have been &s;aved <HI>on their own account,, and on the ground or rea&s;on of their repentance.</HI>&mdash;But if on the other hand it be granted, that repentance does not make atonement or &s;atisfaction for &s;in, and it be ju&s;t to puni&s;h a &s;inner without end, provided he do not repent; it is ju&s;t to inflict the &s;ame puni&s;hment, though he do repent.</P>
<P>THIS chapter &s;hall be clo&s;ed with a remark on a pa&s;&s;age before quoted from Dr. C.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 309.</NOTE> in which he &s;ays, that the dif|ference in the <HI>degree</HI> of the pain of the damned will &s;carce be thought worthy to be brought into the account, when the circum&s;tance of endle&s;s duration, is annexed to it.&mdash; If the different degrees of the mi&s;ery of the damned be un|worthy of notice, and do not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h them ac|cording to their &s;everal degrees of demerit; then the dif|ferent degrees in the happine&s;s of the &s;aints in heaven do not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h them, according to their charac|ters. Therefore on the &s;ame principle we ought to deny the endle&s;s duration of the happine&s;s of heaven, as well as of the mi&s;ery of hell; and to &s;ay, that the difference in the degree of happine&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ed in heaven, will &s;carce be thought worthy to be brought into the account, when the circum&s;tance of endle&s;s duration is annexed to it; that if the happine&s;s of heaven be of endle&s;s duration, the hap|pine&s;s of all the inhabitants of that world will be equal, which is incon&s;i&s;tent with the declarations of &s;cripture, that all &s;hall be rewarded according to their works; and that therefore the doctrine of the endle&s;s happine&s;s of heaven is not true.&mdash;But the fal&s;ity of this conclu&s;ion is evident to all: and equally fal&s;e is the conclu&s;ion from the like pre|mi&s;es, that the puni&s;hment of the damned is not endle&s;s.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Containing another view of the que&s;tion concerning the Ju&s;tice of endle&s;s Puni&s;hment.</HEAD>
<P>IN the preceding chapter, the que&s;tion concerning the ju&s;|tice of endle&s;s puni&s;hment was con&s;idered in the light in which it is &s;tated by Dr. C. There is another view of the &s;ame que&s;tion, which is not indeed exhibited in his book, but is much talked of by &s;ome who in general embrace his &s;cheme. It is this: Whatever the general good requires, is ju&s;t: Whatever is not &s;ub&s;ervient to the general good, is unju&s;t. Now as the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the wicked is, in their opinion, not &s;ub&s;ervient but hurtful to the general good, it is, &s;ay they, unju&s;t. The que&s;tion thus &s;tated &s;eems to be nothing more than a di&s;pute concerning the proper meaning of the word ju&s;tice. It reduces all ju&s;tice to the third &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice as explained above,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 80, &amp;c.</NOTE> and perfectly confounds ju&s;tice with goodne&s;s as it re&s;pects the general &s;y&s;tem. Therefore the que&s;tion which comes up to view, according to the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice now propo&s;ed, is the very &s;ame with this, Whether the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the wicked be con&s;i&s;tent with the general good of the univer&s;e, or with divine goodne&s;s; which &s;hall be con&s;idered at large in the next chapter, and needs not be anticipated here. However it may be proper to point out the impropriety and ab&s;urd con&s;equences of this u&s;e of the word <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>IT was doubtle&s;s &s;ub&s;ervient to the general good, that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was crucified by wicked hands, and therefore in the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice now under con&s;ideration, his crucifixion was ju&s;t; they who perpetrated it, perform|ed an act of ju&s;tice. Yet will any man pretend, that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord was not injuriou&s;ly treated by his wicked crucifiers? If they committed no injury to our Lord, wherein did the wickedne&s;s of this action con&s;i&s;t?&mdash;The truth is, the cru|cifixion of Chri&s;t was no injury to the univer&s;e, but an in|e&s;timable benefit: yet it was the highe&s;t injury that could be done him per&s;onally.</P>
<P>EVERY in&s;tance of murder is doubtle&s;s made by the over|ruling hand of divine providence, &s;ub&s;ervient to the ge|neral good and the divine glory. But does a man murder|ed
<PB N="131" REF="022478_0136_0FB932A7EFD1B6E8">
&s;uffer no injury? The &s;ame may be &s;aid of all the a&s;&s;aults, thefts, robberies, murders and other crimes that have ever been committed. Though they will in the con|&s;ummation of all things be overruled to &s;ub&s;erve the general good, &s;o that the univer&s;e will finally &s;uffer no injury by them; yet very great per&s;onal injury may be done by them to tho&s;e who have been robbed, murdered, &amp;c. The&s;e ob|&s;ervations may &s;how the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;tingui&s;hing between the private rights of individuals, and the rights of the uni|ver&s;e, and between private, per&s;onal inju&s;tice, and inju&s;tice to the univer&s;e. If all the crimes in the world, becau&s;e they will be finally rendered by the divine hand &s;ub&s;er|vient to the good of the univer&s;e, be in every &s;en&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">n|tirely ju&s;t, and the omi&s;&s;ion of them would be unju&s;t; where &s;hall any inju&s;tice be found? No inju&s;tice is, ever was, or can po&s;&s;ibly be committed by any being in this, or any other world. No inju&s;tice can be committed, till &s;ome thing &s;hall be done, which God &s;hall not finally render &s;ub|&s;ervient to his own glory and the good of the intellectual &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the principle now under con&s;ideration, it would not be ju&s;t, that any man &s;hould e&s;cape any cala|mity, which he does in fact &s;uffer. It was not ju&s;t that Paul &s;hould e&s;cape &s;toning at Ly&s;tra, or that John &s;hould not be bani&s;hed to the i&s;le of Patmos: and whenever it is &s;ub&s;er|vient to the public good, that any criminal, a murderer for in&s;tance, &s;hould be pardoned, or &s;hould be &s;uffered to pa&s;s with impunity; it is not ju&s;t to puni&s;h him; he does not de&s;erve puni&s;hment: Cain did not de&s;erve death for the murder of his brother, nor did Joab, during the life of David, de&s;erve death for the two murders of Abner and Ama&s;a, both better men than him&s;elf. And if he did not de&s;erve death, what did he de&s;erve? It appears by the hi&s;tory and by the event, that it was not &s;ub&s;ervient to the general good, that he &s;hould, during the life of David, be puni&s;hed at all. Therefore on the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, he de&s;erved, during that period, no puni&s;hment at all for tho&s;e murders. If &s;o, then during the &s;ame period, at lea&s;t, there was no &s;in, no moral evil in tho&s;e murders: for &s;in or moral evil always de&s;erves hatred and puni&s;h|ment.&mdash;But afterwards in the reign of Solomon, the general good required Joab to be puni&s;hed with death. At that time therefore he de&s;erved death for tho&s;e murders;
<PB N="132" REF="022478_0137_0FB932B201B04040">
and tho&s;e &s;ame actions which for &s;everal years after they were perpetrated, had no moral evil in them, grew, by mere length of time, or change of the circum&s;tances of the &s;tate, to be very great moral evils.&mdash;See then to what con&s;equences the principle now under con&s;ideration will lead us! It mu&s;t therefore be renounced as fal&s;e, or as a great perver&s;ion of language.</P>
<P>WHEN I a&s;&s;ert the ju&s;tice of the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the wicked, I mean that it is ju&s;t in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, in which it was ju&s;t, that Cain or Joab &s;hould be executed as murderers: i. e. it is corre&s;pondent to their per&s;onal con|duct and characters. If tho&s;e with whom I am now di&s;|puting, allow that the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the wicked is ju&s;t in this &s;en&s;e, they allow all for which I at pre&s;ent con|tend. If they deny, that it is ju&s;t in this &s;en&s;e, they give up their favorite principle, and di&s;pute again&s;t the ju&s;tice of endle&s;s puni&s;hment, not merely becau&s;e it would be in|con&s;i&s;tent with the general good, but for the &s;ame rea&s;ons as tho&s;e for which Dr. C. di&s;puted again&s;t it: and they place the que&s;tion on the &s;ame footing, on which it has been &s;o largely con&s;idered in the preceding chapters. The execution of Cain as a murderer would have been corre&s;|pondent to his per&s;onal conduct, and therefore would have been ju&s;t. If the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the wicked be de|nied to be ju&s;t in this &s;en&s;e, it is denied to be ju&s;t, not mere|ly becau&s;e it would not be &s;ub&s;ervient to the good of the univer&s;e; but becau&s;e it would not be a puni&s;hment corre&s;|pondent to their per&s;onal conduct; in&s;tead of this, it would exceed the demerit of that conduct, and therefore would rob them of their per&s;onal rights.</P>

<P>I PROPOSE to begin with &s;tating the que&s;tion,&mdash;then to proceed to &s;ome general ob&s;ervations concerning the di|vine goodne&s;s and &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions made by Dr. C.&mdash; then to con&s;ider Dr. C's arguments from the divine good|ne&s;s;&mdash;and in the la&s;t place, to mention &s;ome con&s;iderations to &s;how, that the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of &s;ome of mankind, is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine goodne&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">I. IT is a matter of great importance, that the que&s;tion now to be con&s;idered be clearly &s;tated. The que&s;tion is, Whether it be con&s;i&s;tent with the divine goodne&s;s, that any of mankind be doomed to endle&s;s puni&s;hment con&s;i&s;ting in mi&s;ery. This que&s;tion is not now to be con&s;idered with any reference to the atonement of Chri&s;t; or the argu|ment in favour of univer&s;al &s;alvation, drawn from the di|vine goodne&s;s, does not depend at all on the atonement. To argue that goodne&s;s requires the &s;alvation of all men now &s;ince Chri&s;t has made a &s;ufficient atonement, implies that without the atonement no &s;uch argument could be urged. To argue from the atonement is not to argue from goodne&s;s merely, but from fact, from the go&s;pel, from particular texts or from the general nature of the go&s;pel. The argument is this; Chri&s;t hath made atonement for all, therefore all will be &s;aved. But that this argument may carry conviction, it mu&s;t fir&s;t be made evident that the atonement did re&s;pect all mankind; al&s;o that it is the intention of God, to apply the virtue of that &s;ufficient atonement, to the actual &s;alvation of all. But the&s;e things can be proved from the declarations of &s;cripture only. Now all Dr. C's arguments from &s;cripture &s;hall be con&s;i|dered in their place; but this is not their place.</P>
<P>THE que&s;tion, Whether it be con&s;i&s;tent with divine goodne&s;s, that any of mankind be puni&s;hed without end, means, either, Whether it be con&s;i&s;tent with the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible exertion or di&s;play of goodne&s;s in the Deity; or Whether it be con&s;i&s;tent with goodne&s;s in general, &s;o that God is in general a good Being, and not <HI>cruel</HI> and <HI>malicious,</HI> though he do inflict endle&s;s puni&s;hment on &s;ome men.&mdash;
<PB N="134" REF="022478_0139_0FB932B5F4F8C698">
It is not an article of my faith, that in all the works of creation and providence taken together, God di&s;plays in|deed goodne&s;s in general, but not the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible goodne&s;s. This di&s;tinction is made, to accommodate the di&s;cour&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, to the meaning of Dr. C. As he denies that God has adopted the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible plan of the univer&s;e, it &s;eems, that he mu&s;t have di&s;tingui&s;hed in his own mind, between the goodne&s;s actually exerted and di&s;|played by the Deity in the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, and the great|e&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;play of goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>IF the former of the&s;e be intended by Dr. C. and others, all their &s;trong and frightful declamations on this &s;ubject, come to this only, that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is not the great|e&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;play of the divine goodne&s;s; or that the &s;y|&s;tem of the univer&s;e, if endle&s;s puni&s;hment make a part of it, is not the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t po&s;&s;ible. &mdash; But this is no more than is holden by Dr. C. and it is pre&s;u|med by other advocates in general for univer&s;al &s;alvation. Dr. C. abundantly holds, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently, that the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, according to his own view of it, without endle&s;s puni&s;hment, is not the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t po&s;&s;ible. It is therefore perfect ab&s;urdity in him, to object, on this ground, to endle&s;s puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>BUT it is manife&s;t, by the vehement and pathetic excla|mations of Dr. C. on this &s;ubject, that he aimed at &s;ome|thing more than this. It is manife&s;t that he &s;uppo&s;ed and meant to repre&s;ent, that if the doctrine of endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment be true, God is not a good, a benevolent being, but a cruel, malicious one. He &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 8.</NOTE> that the doctrine of end|le&s;s puni&s;hment
<Q>gives occa&s;ion for very unworthy re|flections on the Deity:</Q>
That in view of that doctrine
<Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P, 14.</NOTE> an horror of darkne&s;s remains, that is &s;adly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to many a con&s;iderate heart.</Q>
He quotes<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 356</NOTE> with ap|probation tho&s;e words from Mr. Whi&s;ton:
<Q>If the com|mon doctrine were certainly true, the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> of God mu&s;t inevitably be given up, and much more his <HI>mercy.</HI>&mdash; This doctrine &s;uppo&s;es him,</Q>
[God]
<Q>to delight in <HI>cruel|ty,</HI></Q>
So that the que&s;tion agitated by Dr. C. is really, Whether, if God inflict endle&s;s puni&s;hment on any &s;inner, it be not an act of <HI>cruelty</HI> and <HI>inju&s;tice,</HI> as all cruelty is in|ju&s;tice.&mdash;But this is the very que&s;tion, which has been &s;o largely con&s;idered in &s;everal preceding chapters, and needs not to be recon&s;idered here. So that Dr. C's argu|ments
<PB N="135" REF="022478_0140_0FB932B70D4308E8">
from goodne&s;s are mere arguments from ju&s;tice; and if endle&s;s puni&s;hment be reconcileable with divine ju&s;|tice, it is equally reconcileable with divine goodne&s;s, in the &s;en&s;e in which he argue from divine goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>If after all it be in&s;i&s;ted on, that Dr. C. meant to con|&s;ider the que&s;tion, or that the que&s;tion ought to be con&s;i|dered, in the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e &s;tated above, viz. Whether endle&s;s puni&s;hment be con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t perfect di&s;play of goodne&s;s; although if the negative of this que&s;tion were granted, Dr. C. could not con&s;i&s;tently thence draw an ar|gument in favor of univer&s;al &s;alvation; yet it may be pro|per to con&s;ider this &s;tate of the que&s;tion, and perhaps &s;uf|ficient ob&s;ervations upon it will occur in the &s;equel of this chapter.</P>
<P N="2">II. I AM to make &s;ome general ob&s;ervations concerning the divine goodne&s;s, and take notice of &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions made by Dr. C.</P>
<P>The goodne&s;s of God is that glorious attribute, by which he is di&s;po&s;ed to communicate happine&s;s to his creatures. This divine attribute is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the divine ju&s;tice in this manner: the divine ju&s;tice promotes the happine&s;s of the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem, implying the divine glory, by treat|ing a per&s;on &s;trictly according to his own character: the divine goodne&s;s promotes the &s;ame important object, by treating a per&s;on more favorably than is according to his own character or conduct: So that both ju&s;tice and good|ne&s;s may and always do, as far as they are exerci&s;ed, &s;ub|&s;erve the happine&s;s of the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem, including the glory of the Deity, or the glory of the Deity, including the happine&s;s of the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem. As the glory of God, and the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, and even of the created &s;y&s;tem, mutually imply each other; whenever I mention either of them, I wi&s;h to be under|&s;tood to include in my meaning the other al&s;o. The de|clarative or the exhibited glory of God, is a mo&s;t perfect and mo&s;t happy created &s;y&s;tem; and a mo&s;t perfect and mo&s;t happy created &s;y&s;tem is the exhibited glory of God; or it is the exhibition, the manife&s;tation of that glory; as a picture is an exhibition of the man.</P>
<P>THAT infinite goodne&s;s is in God, and is e&s;&s;ential to his nature, is granted on all hands: <HI>God is</HI> LOVE. This at|tribute &s;eeks the happine&s;s of creatures, the happine&s;s of the created &s;y&s;tem in general, and of every individual
<PB N="136" REF="022478_0141_0FB932B871F039B8">
creature in particular, &s;o far as the happine&s;s of that indi|vidual is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem, or with happine&s;s <HI>on the whole.</HI> But if in any ca&s;e, the happine&s;s of an individual be incon&s;i&s;tent with the happi|ne&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem, or with the happine&s;s of other indivi|duals, &s;o that by be&s;towing happine&s;s on the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed individual, the quantity of happine&s;s on the whole &s;hall be dimini&s;hed; in this ca&s;e, goodne&s;s, the divine goodne&s;s, which is perfect and infinite, will not con&s;ent to be&s;tow happine&s;s on that individual. Indeed to be&s;tow happine&s;s in &s;uch a ca&s;e would be no in&s;tance of goodne&s;s, but of the want of goodne&s;s. It would argue a di&s;po&s;ition not to in|crea&s;e happine&s;s, but to dimini&s;h and de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>THEREFORE that Dr. C. might prove, that the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of any &s;inner is incon&s;i&s;tent with the goodne&s;s of God, he &s;hould have &s;hown, that the &s;um total of hap|pine&s;s enjoyed in the intellectual &s;y&s;tem will be greater if all be &s;aved, than it will be if any &s;uffer an endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment. To &s;how that God by his infinite goodne&s;s will be excited to &s;eek and to &s;ecure the greate&s;t happine&s;s of <HI>the &s;y&s;tem,</HI> determines nothing. This is no more than is grant|ed by the believers in endle&s;s puni&s;hment. It is imperti|nent therefore to &s;pend time on this. But the great que&s;|tion is, Does the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem require the final happine&s;s of every &s;inner? If Dr. C, have not &s;hown that it does, his argument from divine goodne&s;s is entirely inconclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of &s;howing, that the divine goodne&s;s or the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the general &s;y&s;tem, requires the final happine&s;s of every individual; Dr. C. has abundantly &s;hown the contrary. In his book on the <HI>Benevolence of the Deity,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 56, &amp;c.</NOTE> he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus;
<Q>It would be injuri|ous to the Deity to complain of him for want of goodne&s;s merely becau&s;e the manife&s;tation of it to our particular &s;y&s;tem, con&s;idered <HI>&s;ingly</HI> and <HI>apart from the re&s;t,</HI> is not &s;o great as we may imagine it could be.&mdash;No more happine&s;s is required for our &s;y&s;tem, even from <HI>infinitely perfect benevolence,</HI> than is proper for a part of &s;ome <HI>great whole.</HI>&mdash;We ought not to con&s;ider the di&s;plays of divine benevolence, as they affect individual beings only, but as they relate to the particular <HI>&s;y&s;tem</HI> of which they are parts.&mdash;The divine benevolence is to be e&s;ti|mated from its amount to <HI>this whole,</HI> and not its <HI>con&s;ti|tuent

<P>BY the&s;e quotations it appears with &s;ufficient clearne&s;s, that it was Dr. C's opinion, that there are defects, mi&s;eries and puni&s;hments of individual creatures, which are con&s;i&s;|tent with the good of the &s;y&s;tem, and are therefore con&s;i&s;|tent with the divine goodne&s;s: and that the divine good|ne&s;s does not &s;eek the happine&s;s of any individual any fur|ther, than the happine&s;s of that individual is &s;ub&s;ervient to the happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem, or to the increa&s;e of happine&s;s on the whole. Therefore Dr. C. &s;uppo&s;es the mi&s;eries of men in this life, and even the puni&s;hments of the future world, are not incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine goodne&s;s, be|cau&s;e they are &s;ub&s;ervient to the good of the &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;
<PB N="138" REF="022478_0143_0FB932BC3847F968">
Now the advocates for endle&s;s puni&s;hment believe the &s;ame concerning the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of tho&s;e who die impe|nitent: and for him to &s;uppo&s;e without proof, that this pu|ni&s;hment is not con&s;i&s;tent with the greate&s;t good and hap|pine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem, is but begging the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>WHAT is the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing, that the endle&s;s pu|ni&s;hment of &s;ome &s;inners may be &s;ub&s;ervient to the good of the &s;y&s;tem? Why may not the general good be promoted, as well by endle&s;s mi&s;ery, as by the mi&s;eries of this life? And why may we not be allowed to account for endle&s;s mi&s;ery in the &s;ame way, that Dr. C. accounts for the mi|&s;eries of this life, or for the temporary mi&s;ery which he al|lows to be in hell? It is now &s;uppo&s;ed to have been proved, that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is ju&s;t. If then the general good may be promoted by the tortures of the &s;tone endured for a year, by a man who de&s;erves them, why may not the ge|neral good be promoted by the &s;ame tortures, continued without end, provided the man de&s;erves &s;uch a continuance of them? If we were to judge <HI>a priori,</HI> we &s;hould probably decide again&s;t mi&s;ery in either ca&s;e. But fact &s;hows that temporary mi&s;eries are con&s;i&s;tent with the goodne&s;s of God, or with the general good: and why may not endle&s;s mi&s;e|ry be &s;o too, provided it be ju&s;t?</P>
<P>IF it be a&s;&s;erted, that the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of a &s;inner who de&s;erves &s;uch puni&s;hment, is &s;o great an evil, that it cannot be compen&s;ated by any good, which can ari&s;e from it to the &s;y&s;tem; I wi&s;h to have a rea&s;on given for this a&s;|&s;ertion. It is granted that the good accruing to the &s;y&s;tem overbalances the temporary mi&s;eries of &s;inners both here and hereafter. And is the endle&s;s mi&s;ery of an individu|al, though ju&s;tly de&s;erved, &s;o great an evil, that it cannot be overbalanced by any endle&s;s good, which may thence accrue to the &s;y&s;tem? Endle&s;s mi&s;ery is doubtle&s;s an infi|nite evil: &s;o is the endle&s;s good thence ari&s;ing, an infinite good.</P>
<P>NOR does it appear, but that all the good ends, which are an&s;wered by the temporary puni&s;hment of the damned, may be continued to be an&s;wered by their continual and endle&s;s puni&s;hment, if it be ju&s;t. God may continue to di&s;play his ju&s;tice, his holine&s;s, his hatred of &s;in, his love of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of the general good, by oppo&s;ing and puni&s;hing tho&s;e who are ob&s;tinately &s;et in the practice of &s;in, and in the oppo&s;ition of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of the ge|neral

In the &s;ame way he may e&s;tabli&s;h his autho|rity, manife&s;t the evil of &s;in, re&s;train others from it, and by a contra&s;t of the circum&s;tances of the &s;aved and damned, increa&s;e the gratitude and happine&s;s of the former, as well as increa&s;e their happine&s;s by the view of the divine holi|ne&s;s, and regard to the general good, manife&s;ted in the pu|ni&s;hment of the ob&s;tinate enemies of holine&s;s and of the gene|ral good; and by a view of divine grace in their own &s;al|vation, and the &s;alvation of all who &s;hall be &s;aved. The&s;e are the principal public ends to be an&s;wered by temporary vindictive puni&s;hment, on &s;uppo&s;ition that future puni&s;h|ment is temporary; and if any other good end to the univer&s;e &s;hall be an&s;wered by it, in the opinion of tho&s;e who believe it, let it be mentioned, that by a thorough enquiry we may &s;ee whether the &s;ame good end may not be an&s;wered by continual and endle&s;s puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>ANOTHER que&s;tion concerning the divine goodne&s;s pro|per to be con&s;idered here, is, whether it <HI>&s;ecure</HI> and <HI>make certain</HI> the final happine&s;s of every man; or whether it be &s;atisfied with this, that opportunity and means are afford|ed to every man to obtain happine&s;s, if he will &s;eize the opportunity and u&s;e the means.&mdash;Concerning this al&s;o, Dr. C. hath &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed his &s;entiments; as in * the following pa&s;&s;ages;
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Benev. of the Deity, p. 60.</NOTE> We mu&s;t not judge of the be|nevolence of the Deity merely from the <HI>actual good</HI> we &s;ee <HI>produced,</HI> but &s;hould likewi&s;e take into con&s;ideration the <HI>tendency</HI> of tho&s;e general laws conformably to which it is produced.

the <HI>tendency</HI> of nature and the divine admini&s;tration, and it actually prevails &s;o far as this tendency is not per|verted by creatures tbem&s;elves,&mdash;for which he [God] is not an&s;werable.</Q>
The Doctor expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the &s;ame purport in many other pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ame book.</P>
<P>IT is manife&s;t, that in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, Dr. C. e&s;teems it a &s;ufficient vindication of the divine goodne&s;s, that God hath e&s;tabli&s;hed good laws, hath benevolently con&s;tituted the nature of things and hath given opportunity to men to &s;ecure to them&s;elves the enjoyment of good: and that the divine goodne&s;s does not imply that every individual crea|ture &s;hall actually enjoy complete good or happine&s;s. If the&s;e things be true, then no argument from the divine goodne&s;s can prove, that every individual of mankind will be finally happy: the divine goodne&s;s though complete and infinite does not &s;ecure <HI>actual happine&s;s</HI> to every indi|vidual: it &s;ecures the opportunity and means only of hap|pine&s;s: or it &s;ecures &s;uch a divine &s;cheme as has a <HI>tendency</HI> to the happine&s;s of all, and would actually prevail to the communication of happine&s;s to all, if it were not perverted by creatures them&s;elves, for which perver&s;ion God is not an&s;werable.</P>
<P>NOW that &s;uch a divine &s;cheme as this is actually adopt|ed, is undoubted truth, and may be granted by every ad|vocate for endle&s;s puni&s;hment. Therefore on the &s;ame ground on which Dr. C. vindicates the goodne&s;s of God, from the objections which ari&s;e from pre&s;ent calamities, and from future temporary puni&s;hment; may the &s;ame goodne&s;s be vindicated from the objections which are rai&s;ed from endle&s;s puni&s;hment. In the former ca&s;e it is pleaded, that God is infinitely good, though creatures &s;uffer cala|mities here and de&s;erved puni&s;hment hereafter, becau&s;e he has given them <HI>opportunity</HI> to obtain happine&s;s, and has adopted a &s;cheme of operation which has a <HI>tendency</HI> to good. Ju&s;t &s;o God is infinitely good, though &s;ome men &s;uffer de&s;erved endle&s;s puni&s;hment; becau&s;e he has given mankind opportunity to obtain eternal life and &s;alvation, and has adopted a &s;cheme of providence and of grace, which will actually prevail to the final &s;alvation of all, if it be not neglected or perverted by men them&s;elves; for which neglect or perver&s;ion God is not an&s;werable.</P>

This is plainly to give up all arguments again&s;t endle&s;s pu|ni&s;hment, drawn from the goodne&s;s of God, or from any o|ther divine perfection. For if
<Q>mo&s;t certainly after all our rea&s;onings</Q>
from the divine perfections as well as from other topics of rea&s;on, we be
<Q>unable to &s;ay what pu|ni&s;hment, as to <HI>kind,</HI> or <HI>degree,</HI> or <HI>duration,</HI> is due in ca&s;e of &s;in;</Q>
then "<HI>mo&s;t certainly</HI> we are unable to &s;ay," but that an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, and that con&s;i&s;ting in mi&s;e|ry too, is due, and is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure and promote the good of the &s;y&s;tem. Therefore to have been con&s;i&s;tent, Dr. C. ought never to have pretended, that endle&s;s mi&s;e|ry is not reconcileable with divine goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>DR. C. further grants, that it may be nece&s;&s;ary, that the penalty of the divine law be inflicted, and that the inflicti|on of it may be honorable to God, and u&s;eful to creatures: yea, he grants, that the full penalty of the law will actual|ly be inflicted on &s;ome men.
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">5 Di&s;&s;er. p. 231.</NOTE> Perhaps the rea&s;ons of government might make it fit and proper, and therefore morally nece&s;&s;ary, that the threatening which God has denounced, &s;hould be executed.

Therefore the que&s;tion propo|&s;ed in the la&s;t quotation may with equal truth and force be propo&s;ed a little differently, thus, Would the wi&s;dom of
<PB N="142" REF="022478_0147_0FB932C90FF1A270">
the &s;upreme legi&s;lator have guarded his prohibition with a penalty, which it was not con&s;i&s;tent with the general good of the univer&s;e, or with the goodne&s;s of his own nature, that he &s;hould in any one in&s;tance inflict?&mdash;Thus it ap|pears to be fully granted, that divine goodne&s;s does not op|po&s;e the infliction of the penalty of the divine law, but re|quires it.&mdash;Nay, as hath been hinted above, Dr. C. ex|pre&s;&s;ly a&s;&s;erts, that the penalty of the law will be inflicted on &s;ome men; that on tho&s;e who pa&s;s through the tor|ments of hell, the divine law will take its cour&s;e, and the threatened penalty will be fully executed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 336.</NOTE>&mdash;Now what the penalty of the divine law is, we have before endeavour|ed to &s;how. Therefore if our rea&s;oning on that head be ju&s;t, it follows from that rea&s;oning and from Dr. C's conce&s;&s;ions in the preceding quotations taken together, that endle&s;s pu|ni&s;hment is not only reconcileable with divine goodne&s;s, but is ab&s;olutely required by it. Would divine goodne&s;s both denounce and actually inflict a penalty, which that goodne&s;s did not require, and which was not even reconcile|able with it?</P>
<P>DR. C. informs us,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">5 Di&s;&s;. p. 247.</NOTE> that
<Q>Chri&s;t was &s;ent into the world, and the great de&s;ign he was &s;ent upon was to <HI>make way</HI> for the WISE, <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>holy</HI> excrci&s;e of mercy&mdash; towards the &s;inful &s;ons of men.</Q>
It &s;eems then, that if it had not been for the mediation of Chri&s;t, there would have been <HI>no way</HI> for the exerci&s;e of mercy towards men, in a con&s;i&s;tency not with ju&s;tice and holine&s;s only, but with wi&s;dom? and if not with wi&s;dom, not with the general good: for wi&s;dom always dictates that which is for the ge|neral good. And if it would not have been con&s;i&s;tent with the general good, to exerci&s;e mercy towards &s;inners, without the mediation of Chri&s;t, neither would it have been con&s;i&s;tent with the divine goodne&s;s, for that and that only which is &s;ub&s;ervient to the general good, is an object to the divine goodne&s;s. In this &s;entiment Dr. C. was very full, as we have already &s;een.&mdash;Therefore without the mediation of Chri&s;t, divine goodne&s;s required, that all man|kind be left in a &s;tate of de&s;pair under the cur&s;e of the law. And if it have been &s;hewn, that this cur&s;e is endle&s;s mi&s;ery, it follows, that divine goodne&s;s, required that all mankind, if it had not been for the mediation of Chri&s;t, &s;hould &s;uffer endle&s;s mi&s;ery.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="143" REF="022478_0148_0FB932CB356D0C38">III. As was propo&s;ed, we now proceed to con&s;ider Dr. C's arguments from the goodne&s;s of God, to prove the &s;alvation of all men.&mdash;If &s;ome of the following quotati|ons be found to be rather po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions than argu|ments; I hope the fault will not be imputed to me, provi|ded I quote tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which contain as &s;trong argu|ments from this topic, as any in his book.</P>
<P><Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 14.</NOTE> IT is high time, that &s;ome generally received doc|trines &s;hould be renounced, and others embraced in their room that are more honourable to the Father of Mer|cies, and comfortable to the creatures whom his hands have formed. I doubt not it has been a perplexing dif|ficulty to mo&s;t per&s;ons (I am &s;ure it has been &s;uch to me) how to reconcile the doctrine which dooms &s;o great a number of the human race to eternal flames, with the e&s;&s;ential, ab&s;olutely perfect goodne&s;s of the Deity.&mdash; And perhaps they contain ideas utterly irreconcileable with each other. To be &s;ure, their con&s;i&s;tency has ne|ver yet been &s;o clearly pointed out, but that a horrour of darkne&s;s &s;till remains that is &s;adly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to many a con&s;iderate tender heart.</Q>
&mdash;In this pa&s;&s;age it is im|plied, that the doctrine of endle&s;s mi&s;ery is not honourable to the Father of Mercies. But what is the proof of this? If there be any, it con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e &s;everal particulars&mdash; That this doctrine is uncomfortable to the creatures of God&mdash;That it has been a perplexing difficulty to &s;ome, Dr. C. thinks to mo&s;t, and "is <HI>&s;ure</HI> it has been &s;uch to HIM," to reconcile that doctrine with the goodne&s;s of God&mdash;That <HI>perhaps</HI> they are irreconcileable&mdash;That to be &s;ure (in Dr. C's opinion) they never have been &s;o reconciled, but that a horrour of darkne&s;s remains.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e be arguments, they require an an&s;wer.&mdash;The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, that the doctrine of endle&s;s mi&s;ery is uncomfort|able, or rather not &s;o comfortable to God's creatures, as &s;ome other doctrines: therefore it is not honourable to the Father of Mercies.&mdash;But would Dr. C. dare to &s;ay, that every doctrine is di&s;honourable to God, which is not equally comfortable to &s;inful creatures, as &s;ome other doc|trines? and that no doctrine is con&s;i&s;tent with the divine goodne&s;s, but tho&s;e which are in the highe&s;t degree com|fortable to &s;uch creatures? What then will follow con|cerning his doctrine of "torment for ages of ages?"&mdash;
<PB N="144" REF="022478_0149_0FB932CD976E2B40">
Or would any man choo&s;e that the compari&s;on be dropped and that the argument be expre&s;&s;ed thus:&mdash;The doctrine of endle&s;s mi&s;ery is uncomfortable to creatures, therefore it is di&s;honourable to God? This &s;till confutes the doctrine of torment for ages of ages. Be&s;ide, if the meaning be, that it is uncomfortable to all creatures, it is a mi&s;take.&mdash; To tho&s;e who believe it to be a ju&s;t and glorious expre&s;&s;ion of the divine hatred of &s;in, and a nece&s;&s;ary mean of vin|dicating the ju&s;tice of God, of &s;upporting the dignity of his government and of promoting the general good; it is &s;o far from being uncomfortable, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to their comfort; and they rejoice in it for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, that they rejoice in the advancement of the general good. They rejoice in it on the &s;ame principles of benevolence and pie|ty, that Dr. C. rejoiced in the pro&s;pect, that the divine law would have its cour&s;e, and the full threatened penalty be executed on &s;ome of mankind.</P>
<P>THE next particular of the above quotation is, that the doctrine of endle&s;s mi&s;ery has been perplexing to &s;ome, or to mo&s;t men, and to be &s;ure to Dr. C.&mdash;Doubtle&s;s this is true of many other doctrines, which however have been believed both by Dr. C. and by other Chri&s;tians: &s;uch as the perfect rectitude, goodne&s;s and impartiality of all the di&s;pen&s;ations of divine providence: the con&s;i&s;tence be|tween the exi&s;tence of &s;in in the world and the infinite wi&s;dom, power, holine&s;s and goodne&s;s of God: the final &s;ub&s;erviency of all events to the divine glory and the ge|neral good of the &s;y&s;tem, &amp;c. Therefore, if the argu|ment prove any thing, it proves too much.</P>
<P>THE third particular is, Perhaps endle&s;s mi&s;ery is not reconcileable with the goodne&s;s of the Deity.&mdash;An&s;wer, Perhaps it is reconcileable with that divine attribute.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t particular is, To be &s;ure (in Dr. C's opinion) they never have been &s;o reconciled, but that a horrour of darkne&s;s remains with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject.&mdash;An&s;wer, In the opinion of many other men, they have often been &s;o reconciled, that there was no rea&s;on, why a horrour of darkne&s;s in view of the &s;ubject &s;hould remain in the mind of any man. They experience no more horrour of dark|ne&s;s in the idea, that God inflicts that endle&s;s puni&s;hment which is perfectly ju&s;t, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;atisfy di|vine ju&s;tice, and vindicate the de&s;pi&s;ed authority, govern|ment and grace of God, and is &s;ub&s;ervient to the glory of
<PB N="145" REF="022478_0150_0FB932CEF47B0B18">
God and the general good; than in the idea of mo&s;t other doctrines of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>BUT let us proceed to another pa&s;&s;age of Dr. C.&mdash;
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 321.</NOTE>Multitudes are taken off before they have had opportu|nity to make them&s;elves hardened abandoned &s;inners: and &s;o far as we are able to judge, had they been con|tinued in life, they might have been formed to a virtu|ous temper of mind, by a &s;uitable mixture of correction, in&s;truction, and the like. And can it be &s;uppo&s;ed with re&s;pect to &s;uch, that an infinitely benevolent God, with|out any other trial, in order to effect their reformation, will con&s;ign them over to endle&s;s and irrever&s;ible tor|ment? Would this be to conduct him&s;elf like a father on earth? Let the heart of a father &s;peak on this occa|&s;ion. Nay, it does not appear, that any &s;inners are &s;o incorrigible in wickedne&s;s, as to be beyond recovery by &s;till further methods within the reach of infinite power: And if the infinitely wi&s;e God can, in any wi&s;e methods, recover them, even in any other &s;tate of trial, may we not argue from his infinite benevolence, that he will?</Q></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t branch of this argument is, that &s;ome die be|fore they become incorrigible; therefore the fatherly good|ne&s;s of God will give them another trial.&mdash;But did Dr. C. know when &s;inners become incorrigible, and when not? Does any man know how long a per&s;on mu&s;t live in &s;in, to arrive at that &s;tate? If not, what right has any man to &s;ay, that any &s;inners die, before God as perfectly knows them to be incorrigible, as if they had lived in &s;in ever &s;o long?&mdash;Be&s;ide, were &s;inners to live in &s;in ever &s;o long, &s;till this objection might be made; and Dr. C. has in fact made it, not only with regard to tho&s;e who die premature|ly, but with regard to all &s;inners. He &s;ays, "It does not appear, that <HI>any</HI> &s;inners are &s;o incorrigible, as to be be|yond recovery by &s;till further methods." That is, if it do not appear, that &s;inners are in this world beyond recovery by &s;till further methods to be u&s;ed for their recovery, we are to believe from God's infinite benevolence, that tho&s;e further methods will be u&s;ed for their recovery. But &s;hould a &s;inner go through the torments of hell, and of ten other &s;ucceeding &s;tates of trial, it is to be pre&s;umed, that Dr. C. would not &s;ay, but that po&s;&s;ibly he might be reco|vered by &s;ome further methods within the power of God
<PB N="146" REF="022478_0151_0FB932D175CF6400">
to u&s;e, if indeed God &s;hould Yee cau&s;e to u&s;e tho&s;e further methods. The ground of this argument is, that goodne&s;s requires, that God u&s;e means for the recovery of &s;inners, as long as it is in the power of God to u&s;e any further means to that end. But this as much needs to be proved as any one propo&s;ition advanced by Dr. C.</P>
<P>THE next branch of this argument is, that it would not be acting like a father on earth, if God were to con&s;ign &s;inners to endle&s;s torment.&mdash;And is it acting like a father on earth, to doom men to the &s;econd death, the lake which burneth with fire and brim&s;tone, and there torment them for ages of ages? Let the heart of a father on earth &s;peak and declare whether it would be agreeable to him, to inflict on his children the&s;e extreme and long continued tortures? or even many of the temporal calamities which God inflicts on mankind; &s;uch as poverty, &s;hame, a feeble &s;ickly habit, extreme pain and di&s;tre&s;s, lo&s;s of rea&s;on, and death attended with the mo&s;t afflicting circum&s;tances? Would a father on earth choo&s;e to plunge his children in the ocean, and leave them to the mercy of the waves? Would he &s;et his hou&s;e on fire, while they were buried in &s;oft &s;lumbers, and con&s;ume them in the flames?&mdash;Such declamatory applications to the pa&s;&s;ions are a two-edged &s;word which will wound Dr. C's &s;cheme, as certainly as that of his opponents. But this controver&s;y is not to be &s;ettled by an application to the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t part of the above quotation de&s;troys the whole. It is this; It does not appear that any &s;inners are &s;o incor|rigible, as to be beyond recovery by &s;till further methods within the reach of infinite wi&s;dom. If God have revealed that no &s;inners &s;hall be recovered after this life, it is doubt|le&s;s a wi&s;e con&s;titution that this life is the only &s;tate of pro|bation. Therefore it is not within the reach of infinite wi&s;dom, to u&s;e any further means after this life for the re|covery of tho&s;e who are incorrigible here. So that this whole paragraph is a mere begging of the que&s;tion: it takes for granted, that this life is not the only &s;tate of pro|bation, or that the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of all who die im|penitent is not a doctrine of divine revelation.</P>
<P>DR. C. el&s;ewhere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 326, 327.</NOTE> argues univer&s;al &s;alvation from this, that God &s;peaks of him&s;elf,
<Q>as the univer&s;al Father of Men;</Q>
and &s;ays,
<Q>fathers on earth cha&s;ti&s;e their
<PB N="147" REF="022478_0152_0FB932D3CED81838">
children for their <HI>profit,</HI> but do not puni&s;h them, ha|ving no view to their <HI>advantage.</HI></Q>
&mdash;But does a father on earth never puni&s;h an incorrigible child, when it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the good of the re&s;t of the family? If he did not, but &s;uffered him to ruin his whole family, or even one of his other children; would be act the part, or de&s;erve the name, of a father?
<Q>And &s;hall we &s;ay that of our Father in Heaven (who in&s;tead of being evil, as all earthly fathers are more or le&s;s, is infinitely good) which we cannot &s;uppo&s;e of any father on earth, till we have fir&s;t dive&s;ted him of the heart of a father?</Q>
&mdash;The truth is, this and all arguments of the kind take for grant|ed what is by no means granted, that the &s;alvation of all men, is &s;ub&s;ervient to the good, not of the per&s;ons &s;aved only, but of the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>IN various pa&s;&s;ages <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 352, &amp;c.</NOTE> Dr. C. has much to &s;ay of our <HI>natu|ral notions of God's goodne&s;s</HI>; particularly, that the natural notions we entertain of the
<Q>goodne&s;s and mercy of God, ri&s;e up in oppo&s;ition to the doctrine of never ending tor|ments.</Q>
I grant that our natural notions of tho&s;e di|vine attributes ri&s;e up in oppo&s;ition to endle&s;s torments, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they are unju&s;t and incon&s;i&s;tent with the general good. But on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they are both ju&s;t and &s;ub&s;ervient to the general good, our natural no|tions ri&s;e up in favour of them. So that this and &s;uch like arguments all depend on taking for granted what is no more granted than the main que&s;tion.</P>
<P>NEARLY allied to the argument from the divine good|ne&s;s, is that by which Dr. C. attempts to prove univer&s;al &s;alvation from the end of God in creation.
<Q><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 1.</NOTE>As the fir&s;t cau&s;e of all things is infinitely benevolent, 'tis not ea&s;y to conceive that he &s;hould bring mankind into exi&s;tence unle&s;s he intended to make them finally happy.</Q>
<Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P 2, 3.</NOTE> If the only good God knew&mdash;that &s;ome free agents would make them&s;elves unhappy, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t efforts of his wi&s;dom to prevent it, why did he create them? To give them exi&s;tence knowing at the &s;ame time that they would render them&s;elves finally mi&s;er|able&mdash;is &s;carce reconcileable with &s;upremely and ab&s;o|&s;olutely perfect benevolence.</Q>
&mdash;This argument, as the preceding, entirely depends on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the final happine&s;s of every individual is nece&s;&s;ary to the great|e&s;t happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem. Doubtle&s;s God is ab&s;olutely
<PB N="148" REF="022478_0153_0FB932D5067820C0">
and perfectly benevolent: but &s;uch benevolence &s;eeks the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem, not of any individual, unle&s;s the happine&s;s of that individual be con&s;i&s;tent with the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem. This is the plain dictate not of rea&s;on only, but of &s;cripture, and is abun|dantly conceded by Dr. C. as appears by the quotations already made. There is no difficulty therefore in con|ceiving, that however the fir&s;t cau&s;e of all things is infi|nitely benevolent, he &s;hould bring mankind into exi&s;tence, though he never intended to make them all finally happy. He might in perfect con&s;i&s;tence with infinite benevolence, bring them into exi&s;tence, intending that &s;ome of them &s;hould &s;uffer that endle&s;s puni&s;hment which they &s;hould de&s;erve, and thereby contribute to the greate&s;t hap|pine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem. And if &s;uch a puni&s;hment be &s;ub|&s;ervient to the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem, infinite be|nevolence not only admits of it, but requires it; nor would God be infinitely benevolent, if he &s;hould &s;ave all men. Therefore this grand argument, on which Dr. C. and other writers in favour of univer&s;al &s;alvation, build &s;o much, is a mere begging of the que&s;tion. Let them &s;how that the greate&s;t good of the &s;y&s;tem requires the final hap|pine&s;s of every individual, and they will indeed have gone far toward the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their &s;cheme. But until they &s;hall have done this, their argument from this topic is utterly inconclu&s;ive. It is no more incon&s;i&s;tent with the goodne&s;s of God, that he &s;hould create men with a fore|&s;ight and an intention, that they &s;hould &s;uffer that endle&s;s puni&s;hment which they &s;hould de&s;erve, and which is &s;ub&s;er|vient to the general good; than that he &s;hould create them with a fore&s;ight and intention, that they &s;hould &s;ub&s;erve the &s;ame important end, by &s;uffering the torment of ages of ages, or the pains of the &s;tone or the colic; provided the&s;e temporary pains are not &s;ub&s;ervient to their per&s;onal good. And to &s;ay that temporary pains cannot con&s;i&s;tently with the divine goodne&s;s be inflicted on the &s;inner, unle&s;s they be &s;ub&s;ervient to the per&s;onal good of the patient, is to contradict the plain dictates of rea&s;on, of &s;cripture, and of Dr. C. him&s;elf. But this &s;ubject has been largely con|&s;idered in Chap. III.</P>
<P>THESE, I think, are Dr. C's principal arguments from the divine goodne&s;s, to prove univer&s;al &s;alvation: I pre|&s;ume, that in his whole book there are none more forcible
<PB N="149" REF="022478_0154_0FB932D7629856A8">
than the&s;e. His arguments of this kind generally, if not univer&s;ally, depend on taking for granted, what is as much in di&s;pute as any point in the whole controver&s;y, that end|le&s;s puni&s;hment is not con&s;i&s;tent with the greate&s;t good of the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem, or the greate&s;t general good. If it be true, that any man will be puni&s;hed without end, no doubt it is &s;o ordered, becau&s;e infinite wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s &s;aw it to be nece&s;&s;ary to the general good. If it be not true, it is equally certain, that infinite wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s &s;aw endle&s;s puni&s;hment to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the ge|neral good. But which of the&s;e is the truth, is the main que&s;tion.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THAT endle&s;s puni&s;hment is con&s;i&s;tent with the di|vine goodne&s;s, not only is implied in various &s;entiments and tenets of Dr. C, but appears to be a real and demon|&s;trable truth. To evince this, I &s;hall now, as was propo|&s;ed, mention &s;everal con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. ALL arguments again&s;t endle&s;s puni&s;hment, drawn from the divine mercy, grace or goodne&s;s, imply a conce&s;|&s;ion, that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is <HI>ju&s;t.</HI> Were it not ju&s;t, there would be no occa&s;ion to call in the aid of <HI>goodne&s;s.</HI> Stern, unrelenting ju&s;tice would afford relief. Nor is there the lea&s;t goodne&s;s, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from ju&s;tice, exerci&s;ed by a judge, in delivering a man from an unju&s;t puni&s;hment, attempted to be brought upon him by a fal&s;e accu&s;er. If therefore the &s;alvation of &s;inners, and of every &s;inner, be an act of goodne&s;s, mercy or grace, as Dr. C. abundantly declares; then endle&s;s puni&s;hment is ju&s;t. And if it be ju&s;t, it appears by Chap. III, that it will be inflicted, and inflicted by God too. Therefore it is con&s;i&s;tent with di|vine goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is hoped it has been made manife&s;t in Chap. II and III, that the end of future puni&s;hment is not the per&s;onal good of the patients, but to &s;atisfy ju&s;tice, and &s;upport the authority and dignity of the divine law and government; as both Dr. C. and the &s;criptures abundantly hold, that the wicked will be puni&s;hed to the utmo&s;t extent of their demerit. Now if the end of future puni&s;hment, whether temporary or endle&s;s, be to &s;atisfy ju&s;tice, and to &s;upport government; then the general good is promoted by the &s;atisfaction of ju&s;tice: otherwi&s;e God would not inflict &s;uch puni&s;hment. And if the proof in Chap. VI, that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is ju&s;t, be valid, then ju&s;tice is not &s;atisfied
<PB N="150" REF="022478_0155_0FB932DA9D20BDC8">
by any puni&s;hment &s;hort of endle&s;s. But by Chap. II and III it appears, that all that puni&s;hment, which the wicked de&s;erve, will actually be inflicted upon them by God. Therefore endle&s;s puni&s;hment is perfectly con&s;i&s;|&s;tent with divine goodne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the divine law may be in any one in&s;tance execu|ted con&s;i&s;tently with divine goodne&s;s, endle&s;s puni&s;hment is con&s;i&s;tent with the divine goodne&s;s. But the divine law may, in &s;ome in&s;tances, be executed con&s;i&s;tent|ly with divine goodne&s;s.&mdash;I have before endea|voured to &s;how, that the penalty of the law is end|le&s;s puni&s;hment. If this be true, then when the law is ex|ecuted, endle&s;s puni&s;hment is inflicted. And who will dare to &s;ay, that God has made a law, which he cannot in any one in&s;tance execute con&s;i&s;tently with his own perfec|tions: And that if he &s;hould execute it in any in&s;tance, his goodne&s;s and mercy mu&s;t be inevitably given up? Nay, he delights in <HI>cruelty</HI>? If the law cannot be executed without cruelty, it is a cruel unju&s;t law: and to make a cruel and unju&s;t law, is as irreconcileable with the moral rectitude of God, as to execute that law. If the infliction of endle&s;s puni&s;hment be cruel, the threatening of it al&s;o is cruel. But this runs into the former que&s;tion, whether endle&s;s pu|ni&s;hment be <HI>ju&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>IF it be &s;aid, though the law is ju&s;t, and the execution of it would not be cruel; yet it cannot be executed con&s;i&s;|tently with the divine goodne&s;s, becau&s;e the divine good|ne&s;s &s;eeks the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible good of the &s;y&s;tem: But the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible good of the &s;y&s;tem requires the final hap|pine&s;s of all:&mdash;As to this I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">(1) THAT it is giving up the argument from divine goodne&s;s in the light, in which Dr. C. has &s;tated it. It appears by the quotations already made, that he held end|le&s;s puni&s;hment to be &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with divine goodne&s;s, that if that puni&s;hment be inflicted, it will prove God to be de&s;titute of goodne&s;s, and to <HI>delight in cruelty.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2) THAT the que&s;tion as now &s;tated comes to no more than this, Whether endle&s;s puni&s;hment be con&s;i&s;tent with the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;play of divine goodne&s;s: For a &s;y&s;|tem, in which there is the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible good, and the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;play of the divine goodne&s;s, are one and the &s;ame thing. But if it were granted, that endle&s;s pu|ni&s;hment is, in this &s;en&s;e, incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine good|ne&s;s,
<PB N="151" REF="022478_0156_0FB932DBDE4918F8">
it would by no means follow, on Dr. C's principles, that all men will be &s;aved. Becau&s;e it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle with him, that divine goodne&s;s is not and cannot be di&s;played, to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree, or &s;o but that there is room for higher di&s;plays and further communica|tions of it.
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Benev. of the Deity, p. 40.</NOTE> Neither is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, becau&s;e God is infinitely benevolent, that he has in fact made an in|finite manife&s;tation of his goodne&s;s.&mdash;Infinity in bene|volence knows no bounds, but there is &s;till room for more and higher di&s;plays of it.&mdash;This perfection is &s;trictly &s;peaking, inexhau&s;tible, not capable of being di&s;|played to a <HI>ne plus.</HI></Q>
Therefore, it would be ab&s;urd for Dr. C. or any one, who agrees with him in the &s;enti|ment expre&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t quotation, to &s;tate the argument from divine goodne&s;s, in the light in which it is exhibited in the objection now under con&s;ideration. This &s;tating of the argument runs entirely into the que&s;tion, whether the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e be the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible; which Dr. C. has &s;ufficiently an&s;wered in the negative, in the pa&s;|&s;age la&s;t quoted, and in many other pa&s;&s;ages of his writings. If it be true, that divine goodne&s;s does not adopt and pro|&s;ecute the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible plan of the univer&s;e in general: what rea&s;on have we to think, that it will adopt and pro|&s;ecute the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible plan with regard to any part of the divine &s;y&s;tem; for in&s;tance the future &s;tate of tho&s;e who die in impenitence?</P>
<P N="3">(3) ON the &s;uppo&s;ition, that God does adopt and pro&s;e|cute the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible plan, both with regard to the univer&s;e in general, and in every particular di&s;pen&s;ation of his pro|vidence; &s;till we &s;hall never be able to determine <HI>a priori,</HI> that the final &s;alvation of all men is, in the &s;en&s;e now un|der con&s;ideration, mo&s;t &s;ub&s;ervient to the general good. It mu&s;t be determined either by the event it&s;elf, or by revela|tion: and whether revelation do a&s;&s;ure us of the &s;alvation of all men, is not the &s;ubject of inquiry in this chapter, but &s;hall be particularly con&s;idered in its place.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF divine goodne&s;s without re&s;pect to the atonement of Chri&s;t, which is foreign from the &s;ubject of this chapter, require the &s;alvation of all men; it either requires that they be &s;aved, whether they repent or not; or it requires, that they be &s;aved on the condition of their repentance only. If it require that they be &s;aved, whether they repent or
<PB N="152" REF="022478_0157_0FB932DD55EBBD78">
not, it follows, that they have done no damage to the uni|ver&s;e, or have committed no &s;in. For the very idea of &s;in is a damage to the univer&s;e, a di&s;honor to God, and an in|jury to the creature. Now whenever a damage is done to the univer&s;e, the good of the univer&s;e, or which in the pre&s;ent argument comes to the &s;ame thing, the divine good|ne&s;s requires reparation. But if the good of the univer&s;e require, that the &s;inner be &s;aved without even repentance, the good of the univer&s;e requires no reparation, and if it require no reparation, it has not been impaired, or there has been no damage done to the good of the univer&s;e: and if no damage have been done to the univer&s;e, no &s;in has been committed. No wonder then, that the divine goodne&s;s requires the &s;alvation of tho&s;e who have com|mitted no &s;in or no moral evil.</P>
<P>IF on the other hand it be allowed, that by &s;in damage is done to the univer&s;e, and yet it be holden, that divine goodne&s;s requires the &s;alvation of all men, on the con|dition of their repentance only; it will follow, that re|pentance alone makes it con&s;i&s;tent with the general good, that the &s;inner be &s;aved. Repentance then repairs the damage done to the univer&s;e by &s;in; and &s;o makes &s;a|tisfaction or atonement for &s;in.&mdash;The very e&s;&s;ence of atonement is &s;omething done to repair the damage done by &s;in to the univer&s;e, &s;o that the &s;inner can be exempted from puni&s;hment, without any di&s;advantage to the univer&s;e. And as repentance is a per&s;onal act of the &s;inner, he does on this &s;uppo&s;ition make atonement for his own &s;in by his per&s;onal virtue. Therefore, if after this he be &s;aved from wrath, he is but treated according to his per&s;onal character, or according to &s;trict ju&s;tice; not ac|cording to goodne&s;s or grace. So that while Dr. C. pro|fe&s;&s;es and &s;uppo&s;es him&s;elf to be arguing from the divine goodne&s;s, the &s;alvation of all men from the wrath to come; his arguments are really drawn from <HI>the ju&s;tice of God only.</HI> They imply either that the &s;inner who is by divine good|ne&s;s to be &s;aved from the wrath to come, is no &s;inner, de|&s;erves no puni&s;hment, and therefore is incapable of being &s;aved from wrath, as he is expo&s;ed to none; or that though he be a &s;inner, he has in his own per&s;on, made full &s;atisfaction for his &s;in, and therefore merits &s;alvation from wrath, and is incapable of it by an act of grace or good|ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="153" REF="022478_0158_0FB932DEC512CC30">4. TO argue the &s;alvation of all men from the goodne&s;s of God, without regard to the atonement of Chri&s;t; and yet to allow that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is ju&s;t, is a direct con|tradiction.&mdash;If it be allowed or proved, that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is ju&s;t, it follows of cour&s;e that it is con&s;i&s;tent with the general good, and which is the &s;ame thing, with the divine goodne&s;s, and is even required by divine good|ne&s;s, on the &s;uppo&s;ition on which we now proceed, that no atonement is made for &s;in. The very idea of a ju&s;t puni&s;hment of any crime is a puni&s;hment which in view of the crime only, is requi&s;ite to repair the damage done to the &s;y&s;tem by that crime. Any further puni&s;hment than this is unju&s;t, and any puni&s;hment &s;hort of this, falls &s;hort of the demand of ju&s;tice. At the &s;ame time that this is demanded by ju&s;tice, it is demanded by the general good too: becau&s;e by the definition of a ju&s;t puni&s;hment, it is nece&s;&s;ary to the general good; nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure it, or to repair the damage done to it, by the crime puni&s;hed. So that a ju&s;t puni&s;hment of any crime is not only con&s;i&s;tent with the general good, but is ab&s;olutely required by it, provided other mea&s;ures equivalent to this puni&s;hment be not taken to repair the damage done by &s;in, or, which is the &s;ame, provided an atonement be not made. And if the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of &s;in be ju&s;t; it is of cour&s;e, on the provi|&s;o ju&s;t made, perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the general good of the univer&s;e, and ab&s;olutely required by it, and equally requi|red by the goodne&s;s of God. And to &s;ay that though it be ju&s;t, it is not reconcileable with the divine goodne&s;s, is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, that though it be ju&s;t, it is not recon|cileable with ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>OBJECTION: Divine goodne&s;s does not admit of the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the apo&s;tle Paul; yet his endle&s;s puni&s;hment would be ju&s;t.&mdash;An&s;wer: Divine goodne&s;s, or the general good of the univer&s;e, con&s;idering the &s;ins or the per&s;onal character of Paul by it&s;elf, does both ad|mit and require his endle&s;s puni&s;hment. But con&s;idering the atonement of Chri&s;t, which, as I have repeatedly ob|&s;erved, comes not into con&s;ideration in the pre&s;ent argu|ment, it does not indeed admit of it.</P>
<P>I BEG leave to a&s;k the advocates for univer&s;al &s;alvation, whether if Chri&s;t had not made atonement, it would have been con&s;i&s;tent with the general good of the univer&s;e, that &s;inners be puni&s;hed without end. If they an&s;wer in the affirmative, then endle&s;s puni&s;hment is in it&s;elf recon|cileable
<PB N="154" REF="022478_0159_0FB932E032974370">
not with ju&s;tice only, but with goodne&s;s too, as goodne&s;s always acquie&s;ces in that which is con&s;i&s;tent with the general good. For if only in con&s;equence of the atone|ment, endle&s;s puni&s;hment be incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine goodne&s;s, it becomes incon&s;i&s;tent with it, not on account of any thing in the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of &s;in, or in the di|vine goodne&s;s &s;imply; but wholly on account of &s;ome|thing external to them both: and therefore that external &s;omething being left out of the account, there is no incon|&s;i&s;tency between the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of &s;in and the di|vine goodne&s;s in them&s;elves con&s;idered. But that they are in them&s;elves incon&s;i&s;tent is implied in Dr. C's argument from divine goodne&s;s; and that they are not in them&s;elves incon&s;i&s;tent is all for which I am now pleading.</P>
<P>IF the an&s;wer to the que&s;tion ju&s;t propo&s;ed be, that it would not be con&s;i&s;tent with the general good, that a &s;in|ner be puni&s;hed without end, even if Chri&s;t had not made atonement; it follows, that &s;uch puni&s;hment is not ju&s;t; as the very definition of a ju&s;t puni&s;hment is, one which in view of the &s;inner's per&s;onal character only is nece&s;&s;ary to the general good.&mdash;Or if this be not a proper defini|tion of a ju&s;t puni&s;hment, let a better be given. Any pu|ni&s;hment is ju&s;t, or is de&s;erved, for no other rea&s;on, than that the criminal viewed in him&s;elf owes it to the public, or the general good requires it.</P>
<P N="5">5. IF divine goodne&s;s require, that every &s;inner be, on on his mere repentance, exempted from puni&s;hment, it will follow, that &s;in is no moral evil.&mdash;If divine goodne&s;s require that every &s;inner be, on his mere repentance, ex|empted from puni&s;hment, the general good of the univer&s;e requires the &s;ame. If the general good do require it, then either the &s;inner hath in that action of which he re|pents, done nothing by which the general good hath been impaired; or that impairment is repaired by his repent|ance. For if he have impaired the general good, and not afterward repaired it, then by the very terms it re|quires reparation. And this which the general good in the&s;e ca&s;es requires of the &s;inner for the reparation of the general good, is his puni&s;hment, and not his exemption from pu|ni&s;hment. But if the &s;inner have done nothing which re|quires that reparation be made to the general good, then he hath committed nothing which hath impaired the gene|ral good: or, which is the &s;ame, he hath committed no
<PB N="155" REF="022478_0160_0FB932E1AC282B30">
moral evil. For moral evil is a voluntary act impairing the general good con&s;i&s;ting in the glory of God and the hap|pine&s;s of the created &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;Or if it be &s;aid, that the repentance of the &s;inner repairs the general good, and prevents the ill effects of his &s;in; I an&s;wer, repentance is no puni&s;hment, nor any reparation of damage to the uni|ver&s;e by a pa&s;t action. It is a mere ce&s;&s;ation from &s;in and a &s;orrow for it. A man who has committed murder, makes by repentance no reparation for the damage which is there|by done to &s;ociety or to the univer&s;e. So that if ever any damage were done to the univer&s;e by &s;in, and if therefore the public good required that reparation be made by the puni&s;hment of the &s;inner, it &s;till requires the &s;ame, and therefore does not require his exemption from puni&s;hment. Be&s;ide; the fal&s;e and ab&s;urd con&s;equences<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the&s;e con&s;idered at large in Chap. II.</NOTE> nece&s;&s;arily following from the principle that the penitent de&s;erves no puni&s;hment, which is the &s;ame with this, that the general good does not require that the penitent, viewed in his own character merely, be puni&s;hed; plainly point out the fal&s;ity and ab&s;urdity of the principle it&s;elf. Particularly this con&s;equence, that on that &s;uppo&s;ition the penitent never is nor can be forgiven, as he makes by his repentance full &s;atisfaction in his own per&s;on, and thus an&s;wers the de|mand of ju&s;tice or of the general good.&mdash;But if it be true, that repentance does not repair the damage done by &s;in to the univer&s;e; and if as is now a&s;&s;erted, the general good do require that the penitent &s;inner, without regard to the atonement of Chri&s;t, be exempted from puni&s;hment; it required the &s;ame before he repented; con&s;equently his &s;in never did impair the good of the univer&s;e, and there|fore is no moral evil.</P>
<P>OBJECTION 1. The fourth argument &s;eems to imply, that &s;in con&s;i&s;ts in damage actually done to the univer&s;e: whereas there are many &s;ins, in which no real damage is actually done. As if a man &s;tab another with a de&s;ign to murder him, and open an ab&s;ce&s;s, whereby the man is be|nefited in&s;tead of murdered; and in all acts of malice, which are not executed, no damage is actually done.</P>
<P>ANSW. Taking the word damage in a large &s;en&s;e, to mean, not merely lo&s;s of property, as it is &s;ometimes taken, but mi&s;ery, calamity or natural evil; it may be granted, that &s;in does con&s;i&s;t in voluntarily doing damage to the uni|ver&s;e. It is a mi&s;ery, a calamity, or a natural evil to any
<PB N="156" REF="022478_0161_0FB932E330FE4068">
man, to be the object of the malice of any other per&s;on, though his malice be never executed. It expo&s;es him to the execution of that malice: it renders him un&s;afe: and to be un&s;afe is a calamity; e&s;pecially to be the object of the malice of another to &s;uch a degree, that the malicious man attempts the life of the object of his malice. In this ca&s;e the man who is the object of malice is very un&s;afe in|deed.&mdash;And if but one per&s;on be in a calamitous &s;ituati|on, &s;o far at lea&s;t the public good is impaired, or the uni|ver&s;e is damaged. Be&s;ides, if that one act impairing the public good, be left unpuni&s;hed, and no proper re&s;traint by the puni&s;hment of the act, be laid upon the man him&s;elf and upon others, the flood-gate is opened to innumerable more acts of the &s;ame, or a like kind. This &s;urely is a further calamity to the univer&s;e. So that every &s;inful vo|lition, though it fail of its object in the attempt, or though it be not attempted to be executed in overt act, is a real calamity or damage to the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>OBJECT. 2. The preceding rea&s;oning mu&s;t needs be fal|lacious, as it implies, that goodne&s;s or grace is never exer|ci&s;ed in any ca&s;e, wherein puni&s;hment is de&s;erved; that whatever is admitted by ju&s;tice, is required by goodne&s;s; and that if &s;in be a moral evil and de&s;erve puni&s;hment, it cannot con&s;i&s;tently with the general good be forgiven.</P>
<P>ANSW. This is not true. The rea&s;oning above does not imply, but that there may be, con&s;i&s;tently with the ge|neral good, the forgivene&s;s of &s;ome &s;inners. Nor does it imply, but that the general good may <HI>require</HI> the for|givene&s;s of &s;ome &s;inners; as undoubtedly it does require the forgivene&s;s of all who repent and believe in Chri&s;t, and &s;o become intere&s;ted in him according to the Go&s;pel. Nor does <HI>this rea&s;oning</HI> imply, but that &s;ome &s;inners may obtain forgivene&s;s on &s;ome other account than the merits of Chri&s;t: though I believe it may be clearly &s;hown from &s;crip|ture, that forgivene&s;s can be obtained on no other account. But this rea&s;oning does a&s;&s;ert, that if all penitents <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> or merely becau&s;e they are penitents, or on account of their own repentance and reformation, be required by divine goodne&s;s to be exempted from puni&s;hment; then &s;in de|&s;erves no puni&s;hment and is no moral evil.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE voice of rea&s;on is, that divine goodne&s;s, or a regard to the general good requires, that &s;in be puni&s;hed according to its demerit, in &s;ome in&s;tances at lea&s;t: other|wi&s;e

God would not appear to be what he really is, an ene|my to &s;in, and greatly di&s;plea&s;ed with it.&mdash;It is certain|ly con&s;i&s;tent with divine goodne&s;s, that &s;in exi&s;ts in the world, otherwi&s;e it would never have exi&s;ted. Now &s;ince &s;in is in the world, if God were never to puni&s;h it, it would &s;eem, that he is no enemy to it. Or if he puni&s;h it in a far le&s;s degree than it de&s;erves, &s;till it would &s;eem, that his di&s;plea&s;ure at it is far le&s;s than it is and ought to be. Nor can mere words or verbal declarations of the Deity &s;ufficiently exhibit his oppo&s;ition to &s;in, &s;o long as he uni|formly treats the righteous and the wicked in the &s;ame manner. His character in view of intelligent creatures will appear to be what it is holden forth to be in his actions, rather than what he in mere words declares it to be. But will any man &s;ay, that it is conducive to the good order and happine&s;s of the intellectual &s;y&s;tem, that God &s;hould ap|pear to be no enemy, but rather a friend to &s;in?</P>
<P>OBJECTION. God would &s;till appear to be an enemy to &s;in, though he were not to puni&s;h it: becau&s;e he takes the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures, to extirpate it by leading &s;inners to repentance.&mdash;An&s;w. The extirpation of &s;in &s;hows no other hatred of it, than a phy&s;ician &s;hows to a di&s;ea&s;e, which he takes the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to aboli&s;h, by the re|&s;toration of health. But the&s;e mea&s;ures of the phy&s;ician do not &s;how, that he views his patient as blameable. Sick|ne&s;s is no moral evil, and all the pains of the phy&s;ician to remove &s;ickne&s;s, are no te&s;timony of his abhorrence of mo|ral evil. But &s;in is a moral evil, and it is &s;ub&s;ervient to the general good, that the great governor of the univer&s;e &s;hould te&s;tify his abhorrence of it, as a moral evil, or as ju&s;tly blameable. To this end he mu&s;t do &s;omething fur|ther than is done by the phy&s;ician, who heals his patient: he mu&s;t either in the per&s;on of the &s;inner, or in his &s;ub&s;ti|tute, puni&s;h &s;in, and that according to its demerit; other|wi&s;e he will not &s;how him&s;elf di&s;plea&s;ed at it as a moral e|vil.</P>
<P>HATRED of &s;in is as e&s;&s;ential to the Deity as love of ho|line&s;s; and it is as honorable to him and as nece&s;&s;ary to the general good, that he expre&s;s the former as the latter. Indeed the latter is no further expre&s;&s;ed, than the former is expre&s;&s;ed: and &s;o far as the former is doubtful, the latter is doubtful too. The que&s;tion then comes to this, whether it be con&s;i&s;tent with the general good, that God &s;hould in
<PB N="158" REF="022478_0163_0FB932F1D86A6D60">
actions, as well as words, expre&s;s his abhorrence of &s;in as blameable, or as a moral evil; and expre&s;s this abhorrence to a ju&s;t degree. If this be con&s;i&s;tent with the general good, it is al&s;o con&s;i&s;tent with the general good, that &s;in be puni&s;hed according to its demerit: and if it de&s;erve an end|le&s;s puni&s;hment, it is con&s;i&s;tent with the general good and with divine goodne&s;s, that &s;uch a puni&s;hment be inflicted.</P>
<P N="7">7. THAT endle&s;s puni&s;hment is incon&s;i&s;tent with divine goodne&s;s, and that all men are &s;aved by free grace, is a di|rect contradiction. To be &s;aved is to be delivered from the cur&s;e of the law, which we have before endeavoured to &s;how to be an endle&s;s puni&s;hment. But to be &s;aved from this by free grace, implies, that the per&s;on &s;o &s;aved, de&s;erves endle&s;s puni&s;hment, and that &s;uch puni&s;hment is with re&s;pect to him ju&s;t. But whatever puni&s;hment is ju&s;t with re&s;pect to any man, provided no atonement be made by a &s;ub&s;titute, is nece&s;&s;ary to the public good; and unle&s;s it be nece&s;&s;ary to the public good, it is unju&s;t. If it be nece&s;&s;ary to the public good, the public good requires it: and if the public good require it, divine goodne&s;s requires it. Therefore to apply this rea&s;oning to the endle&s;s pu|ni&s;hment of the &s;inner:&mdash;The &s;alvation of the &s;inner con|&s;i&s;ts in deliverance from the cur&s;e of the law: the cur&s;e of the law is endle&s;s puni&s;hment; and to be delivered from this by free grace, implies, that the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the &s;inner is ju&s;t. If the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the &s;inner be ju&s;t, and no atonement be made by a &s;ub&s;titute, the pub|lic good requires his endle&s;s puni&s;hment, and the divine goodne&s;s of cour&s;e requires it. So that if the &s;inner can be &s;aved by free grace only, and no atonement be made by a &s;ub&s;titute, the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the &s;inner is not at all incon&s;i&s;tent with divine goodne&s;s; and to &s;ay that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine goodne&s;s, and yet to &s;ay that all men are &s;aved by free grace, and can be &s;aved in no other way, implies, as I &s;aid, a direct contradiction. It implies, that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is ju&s;t, as the deliverance from it is the fruit of grace only: it al&s;o implies, that it is not ju&s;t, as the public good or the divine goodne&s;s does not require it, but is incon&s;i&s;tent with it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> In which is con&s;idered Dr. Chauncy's argument from Rom. V, <HI>12,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING in the preceding chapters con&s;idered Dr. C's arguments from rea&s;on and from the divine per|fections, I proceed now to con&s;ider tho&s;e which are drawn from particular pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture. The fir&s;t of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which demands our attention is Rom. V, 12, &amp;c.
<Q>Wherefore, as by one man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in; and &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men; for that all have &s;inned. For until the law &s;in was in the world; but &s;in is not imputed, when there is no law. Neverthele&s;s death reigned from Adam to Mo&s;es, even over them that had not &s;inned, after the &s;imilitude of Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, who is the figure of him that was to come. But not as the offence, &s;o al&s;o is the free gift. For if through the offence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one that &s;inned, &s;o is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation; but the free gift is of many offences unto ju&s;tification. For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall reign in life by one, Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came up|on all men to condemnation: even &s;o by the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men unto ju&s;tifica|tion of life. For as by one man's di&s;obedience many were made &s;inners; &s;o by the obedience of one, &s;hall many be made righteous. Moreover, the law entered that grace might abound: but where &s;in abounded, grace did much more abound: That as &s;in hath reigned un|to death, even &s;o might grace reign through righte|ou&s;ne&s;s unto eternal life, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our Lord.</Q></P>
<P>THE Doctor's argument from this pa&s;&s;age depends wholly on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the apo&s;tle con&s;iders "Adam and Chri&s;t as the re&s;pective oppo&s;ite &s;ources of death and life to mankind univer&s;ally:" Or that Chri&s;t is the &s;ource
<PB N="160" REF="022478_0165_0FB932F574A6C280">
of life and eternal &s;alvation to all men without exception, as Adam was the &s;ource of death to all men without ex|ception. The Doctor's rea&s;ons to &s;upport this propo&s;ition are,&mdash;(1) That in the 15th ver&s;e it is &s;aid,
<Q>If through the offence of one many be dead, much more hath the grace of God abounded unto many:</Q>
and as by <HI>many</HI> in the former part of this ver&s;e is meant all men, there|fore he concludes that the &s;ame word is u&s;ed in the &s;ame exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, in the latter part of the ver&s;e: "the antithe&s;is," he &s;ays, "will otherwi&s;e be lo&s;t."&mdash; (2) The word <HI>many,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, means <HI>all men,</HI> becau&s;e the article is prefixed to it, <GAP DESC="foreign">.&mdash;(3) That in the 18th ver&s;e it is expre&s;&s;ly a&s;&s;erted,
<Q>As by the offence of one, the judgment came upon <HI>all men,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, to condemnation; even &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon <HI>all men,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, unto ju&s;tification of life.</Q>
Whence the Doctor concludes, that the words <HI>all men</HI> in both parts of the compari&s;on, are u&s;ed in the &s;ame extent.&mdash;(4) That the advantage by Chri&s;t <HI>exceeds, abounds beyond,</HI> the di&s;advantage by Adam; but this, unle&s;s all men be &s;aved, would be &s;o far from the truth, that the former would
<Q>&s;ink below the latter.</Q>
&mdash;Let us attend to the&s;e di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE word <HI>many</HI> in the former part of the 15th and 19th ver&s;es, means <HI>all men</HI>: therefore it means the &s;ame in the latter part of tho&s;e ver&s;es:
<Q>the antithe&s;is will otherwi&s;e be lo&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 32, 60, &amp;c.</NOTE></Q>
Now how does the truth of this propo&s;ition appear? It mu&s;t certainly be &s;upported by pro|per proof, to obtain credit. But in the very many in&s;tan|ces in which the Doctor is plea&s;ed to repeat this propo&s;i|tion, in his long commentary on Rom. V, 12, &amp;c. I do not find one rea&s;on offered to prove it, be&s;ide that quoted above, "The antithe&s;is will otherwi&s;e be lo&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 32, 60, &amp;c.</NOTE>" This therefore is now to be con&s;idered.&mdash;In the rebellion in Great Bri|tain, 1745, large numbers of men were engaged in the rebellion, and were led away by the Pretender. After the Pretender was defeated, large numbers, by the influ|ence of &s;ome particular per&s;on, we will &s;uppo&s;e, return|ed to their allegiance, and took the proper oaths to the King: yet not all who were drawn into the rebellion by the Pretender. Now would there be any improprie|ty in &s;aying in this ca&s;e, As by the Pretender <HI>many</HI> had
<PB N="161" REF="022478_0166_0FB932F7A0D59FD8">
been drawn into the rebellion, &s;o by that other per&s;on <HI>ma|ny</HI> were brought back to their allegiance? The former <HI>ma|ny</HI> is allowed to be more exten&s;ive, than the latter; yet there is a manife&s;t antithe&s;is in the propo&s;ition; an anti|the&s;is as manife&s;t as there would have been, if the men who returned to their allegiance, had been ju&s;t as numerous as tho&s;e who engaged in the rebellion, and had been the &s;ame individuals. Equally manife&s;t it is, that though the <HI>many,</HI> who died in Adam, be more numerous than the <HI>many</HI> who are the &s;ubjects of &s;aving grace by Chri&s;t: yet there is a proper antithe&s;is in this propo&s;ition,&mdash;
<Q>If through the of|fence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath abounded unto many.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. THE word <HI>many,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, means all men, becau&s;e the arti|cle is joined with it, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the many.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 60.</NOTE>&mdash;If this be evident at all, it mu&s;t be evident either from the general u&s;e of the adjective <GAP DESC="foreign">, when connected with the article, or from the circum&s;tances of the particular ca&s;e in which it is u&s;ed in this pa&s;&s;age, Rom. V. 15 and 19. If the validity of the argument now under con&s;ideration, be evident from the ge|neral u&s;e of <GAP DESC="foreign">
in the plural with the article; then gene|rally when u&s;ed by good authors, and e&s;pecially by the au|thors of the New Te&s;tament, it means a &s;trict univer&s;ality. Let us therefore attend to particular in&s;tances.&mdash;Acts XXVI, 24. "Much learning doth make thee mad;" <GAP DESC="foreign">. But no man will &s;ay, that this expre&s;&s;ion means all learning. The u&s;e of the article however is ve|ry proper, and the expre&s;&s;ion means the much learning of which the apo&s;tle was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.&mdash;2 Cor. II, 17;
<Q>For we are not as <HI>many,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, which corrupt the word of God.</Q>
If <GAP DESC="foreign">
here mean <HI>all</HI> men, the apo&s;tle in direct contradiction to him&s;elf in this very expre&s;&s;ion, means that he him&s;elf, and all the other apo&s;tles, as well the re&s;t of mankind, did corrupt the word of God.&mdash;Rev. XVII, 1;
<Q>I will &s;how unto thee the judgment of the great whore, that &s;itteth upon <HI>many</HI> waters,</Q>
<GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>All</HI> waters, or <HI>all people</HI> cannot be meant, becau&s;e by far the greater part of the nations of the world never were under the influence of the great whore.&mdash;The only other in&s;tances in the whole New Te&s;tament, in which <GAP DESC="foreign">
in the plural is u&s;ed with the article, are Mat. XXIV, 12. Rom. XII, 5. Ch. XV, 22. 1 Cor. X, 17 and 33,
<PB N="162" REF="022478_0167_0FB932F904BF7C10">
which the reader may examine for him&s;elf, and it is pre|&s;umed, he will find, that in no one of them is a &s;trict uni|ver&s;ality clearly intended. If this be &s;o, it is by no means evident from the general u&s;e of <GAP DESC="foreign">
in the plural with the article, that <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>many,</HI> in Rom. V, 15 and 19, means <HI>all</HI> men.</P>
<P>NOR is this more evident from the circum&s;tances of the particular ca&s;e, in which <HI>many,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, is u&s;ed in Rom. V. 15. Let it be tran&s;lated as Dr. C. choo&s;es to tran&s;late it, thus: If through the offence of one, <HI>the many</HI> be dead, much more the grace of God, by one man, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath abounded unto <HI>the many.</HI> Nothing appears from the expre&s;&s;ion, but that the meaning of the apo&s;tle may be, what it has generally been under&s;tood to be, that <HI>the many</HI> who were connected with Adam, and who&s;e life or death depended on his &s;tanding or falling, became dead through his offence: and <HI>the many</HI> who are connected with Chri&s;t, and with a particular de&s;ign to &s;ave whom, He died, &s;hall be made the &s;ubjects of the abounding grace of God in their mo&s;t glorious &s;alvation.&mdash;I &s;ay, nothing appears, either from the general u&s;e of <GAP DESC="foreign">, or from the particular u&s;e of it in this ca&s;e, but that this and this only is the real &s;en&s;e of it, in this in&s;tance. And for Dr. C. to wi&s;h his readers, before he has given them a rea&s;on, to give up this &s;en&s;e in favor of his own, is for him to come to them in the humble character of a &s;uppliant, and not in the dignified character of a cogent rea&s;oner.</P>
<P N="3">3. IN the 18th ver&s;e, it is expre&s;&s;ly a&s;&s;erted, As by the offence of one, judgment came upon <HI>all men,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, to condemnation; even &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon <HI>all men,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, to ju&s;tification of life: whence Dr, C. concludes, that the words <HI>all men,</HI> in both parts of the compari&s;on are u&s;ed in the &s;ame extent; and &s;ays,
<Q>It can be no other than a flat contradiction to the expre&s;s words of the apo&s;tle to &s;ay, that in the latter part of this compari&s;on not <HI>all men</HI> are meant, but <HI>believers only</HI>; that is, a few of them.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 32.</NOTE> It is indeed a flat contradiction to Dr. C's &s;en&s;e of the apo&s;tle's words; but that it is a contradiction to the true &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e words, does not appear. If it &s;hould be further granted to be a contradiction to the mo&s;t <HI>literal</HI> &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e words taken by them&s;elves, it would not thence follow, that it is a contradiction to the true
<PB N="163" REF="022478_0168_0FB932FB3A904388">
and real &s;en&s;e of the words. The real &s;en&s;e of words in all authors, is in thou&s;ands of in&s;tances to be known, not from the words them&s;elves merely, but from their con+nection and other circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE Dr. rightly a&s;&s;erts, that the words <HI>all</HI> men in ver&s;e 18th, mean the &s;ame with <HI>the many</HI> in ver&s;e 15th. And as it has been &s;hown, that there is no evidence given by the Doctor, that <HI>the many,</HI> to whom grace abounds through Chri&s;t, mean <HI>all</HI> men; &s;o all men in the 18th ver&s;e mean|ing, by his own con&s;ent, the &s;ame with <HI>the many</HI> in ver&s;e 15th, mu&s;t, until we have evidence to the contrary, be un|der&s;tood with the &s;ame re&s;triction. To carry on the com|pari&s;on, and maintain the antithe&s;is, there is no more ne|ce&s;&s;ity of under&s;tanding the words <HI>all men,</HI> when applied to the &s;aved by Chri&s;t in the 18th ver&s;e, to mean the whole human race; than there is of under&s;tanding in that extent, <HI>the many</HI> in the latter part of ver&s;e 15th.</P>
<P>BESIDE; the meaning of tho&s;e words is abundantly re&s;tricted by the context: as ver&s;e 17th,
<Q>For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall reign by one, Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q>
The 18th ver&s;e is an inference drawn from the 17th, and is in|troduced by <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>therefore.</HI> But the 18th ver&s;e would be no ju&s;t inference at all from the 17th, unle&s;s the words <HI>all men</HI> in the latter part of the 18th ver&s;e be equally re|&s;tricted as the words <HI>they which receive abundance of grace,</HI> in the 17th ver&s;e. Let us make trial of under&s;tanding tho&s;e phra&s;es in a &s;en&s;e differently exten&s;ive, thus; For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more true believers in this life, who are the &s;ubjects of the peculiar and abundant grace of God, &s;hall reign in eternal life by one, Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men univer&s;ally to condemnation; even &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men univer&s;ally unto ju&s;tification of life, whether in this world they believe or not. The whole force of this rea&s;oning is more briefly expre&s;&s;ed thus; Tho&s;e who be|lieve in this life, &s;hall reign in life eternal: therefore al&s;o <HI>all</HI> men, whether they believe in this life or not, &s;hall in like manner reign in life eternal. But who does not &s;ee, that this con&s;equence by no means follows from the pre|mi&s;es?</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="022478_0169_0FB932FCCA21E710">ALTHOUGH Dr. C. &s;uppo&s;es "this <HI>therefore</HI>" [in ver&s;e 18th,] "is the &s;ame which began the 12th ver&s;e:"&mdash; yet he allows,

<Q>INTER|POSED parenthe&s;is.</Q>
Let the reader notice the follow|ing pa&s;&s;age;
<Q>The view of the apo&s;tle in interpo&s;ing the&s;e ver&s;es</Q>
[the 15th, 16th, and 17th,]
<Q>was that he might argue from the gift in this abounding &s;en&s;e, when he came to pro&s;ecute the compari&s;on between Adam and Chri&s;t&mdash;And if the gift through Chri&s;t might be &s;uppo&s;ed to abound beyond the lap&s;e, in the 15th, 16th, and 17th ver&s;es, why not in the 18th and 19th?</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 68</NOTE></P>
<P>INDEED the Doctor him&s;elf allows, that the <HI>all</HI> men in the latter part of the 18th ver&s;e, is no more exten&s;ive, than <HI>they which receive abundance of grace</HI> in the 17th ver&s;e. But he &s;uppo&s;es that the latter expre&s;&s;ion is equally extend|ed with the former, and that the former extends to all mankind. I &s;ay, he <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> this: but his opponents in this controver&s;y &s;uppo&s;e the contrary; and how does it ap|pear, but that their &s;uppo&s;ition is as good as his? If the Doctor wi&s;hed that we &s;hould give the preference to his &s;uppo&s;ition, he ought to have given us &s;ome rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE Doctor with the help of a "learned friend" has given us a long di&s;&s;ertation on the 17th ver&s;e, and on the Greek verb <GAP DESC="foreign">, with a de&s;ign to prove, that <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>they who receive,</HI> mean not tho&s;e who receive the grace of God <HI>actively, voluntarily</HI> and <HI>with a heart to im|prove it</HI>; but tho&s;e who are the "objects of this grace," "or the per&s;ons upon whom it is be&s;towed." But this is altogether immaterial in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute. By the a|bundance of grace Dr. C. under&s;tands <HI>the abounding advan|tage by Chri&s;t, terminating in a reign in life.</HI>&mdash;Now it will be granted on all hands, that they on whom this grace is be&s;towed, will be &s;aved. Indeed the very expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>reigning in life,</HI> implies &s;alvation. Tho&s;e therefore on whom this grace is be&s;towed, will as certainly and as con|fe&s;&s;edly
<PB N="165" REF="022478_0170_0FB932FF0358E730">
be &s;aved, as tho&s;e who cheerfully receive and im|prove the grace of God. All the que&s;tion is, and a very important one it is, whether this abounding grace termina|ting in a reign in life, be be&s;towed on all men. That it is preached or offered to all men, is granted. But that it is &s;o communicated to all, as to &s;ecure their reign in life, is a different idea, and is the main &s;ubject of this contro|ver&s;y.</P>
<P>SO that all the labours of Dr. C. and his
<Q>ingenious friend,</Q>
to &s;ettle the meaning of <HI>receive,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, con|tribute nothing to e&s;tabli&s;h this point, That <HI>all men</HI> in the latter part of ver&s;e 18th, mean the whole human race. So long as the Doctor grants, that the words <HI>all men,</HI> ver&s;e 18th, are not more exten&s;ive than they which receive a|bundance of grace, ver&s;e 17th; and &s;o long as he has not proved, that they which receive abundance of grace, &s;o as to reign in eternal life, mean the whole human race; &s;o long nothing is done to prove univer&s;al &s;alvation, from the u&s;e of the words <HI>all men,</HI> ver&s;e 18th. To &s;ay, that <HI>they which receive abundance of grace</HI> mean all mankind, becau&s;e that expre&s;&s;ion is equally exten&s;ive as the words <HI>all men</HI> in the 18th ver&s;e, is a mere begging of the que&s;tion. It is in the fir&s;t place to &s;uppo&s;e and not to prove, that the words <HI>all men</HI> mean all mankind; and then by them to prove, that al&s;o <HI>they which receive abundance of grace,</HI> mean all mankind.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;al term <HI>all men,</HI> ver&s;e 18th, is by the for|mer part of the chapter limited to tho&s;e who are ju&s;tified by faith, who have peace with God, and who joy in God, through Chri&s;t, as having received reconciliation. Dr. C's opinion was, that the 18th ver&s;e is but the full expre&s;|&s;ion of the &s;entence left imperfect in the 12th ver&s;e, and that the <HI>therefore</HI> in the beginning of the 18th ver&s;e
<Q>is the &s;ame which began the 12th ver&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 67.</NOTE></Q>
The 18th ver&s;e then is an immediate conclu&s;ion from the ver&s;es pre|ceding the 12th, e&s;pecially from the 11th. Now the be|lievers in endle&s;s puni&s;hment hold, that in all that part of the chapter, from the beginning to the 12th ver&s;e, the a|po&s;tle had been &s;peaking of the privileges of believers on|ly, and not tho&s;e privileges which belong to all mankind. And to infer from tho&s;e privileges which are peculiar to believers, that all mankind will be &s;aved, is to infer a con|&s;equence,

which is by no means contained in the premi&s;es: and &s;uch rea&s;oning ought never to be imputed to any man of Paul's &s;ound judgment, much le&s;s to <HI>him,</HI> an in&s;pired a|po&s;tle.</P>
<P>TO illu&s;trate this matter, permit me to de&s;cend to par|ticulars. Ver&s;e 1&s;t, believers are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified by faith and to have peace with God: ver&s;e 2d, to have acce&s;s by faith into the grace of the go&s;pel and to rejoice (or glory) in the hope of the glory of God: ver&s;e 3d, to glory in tri|bulations: ver&s;e 5th, to have the love of God &s;hed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Gho&s;t: ver&s;e 8th, it is &s;aid that God commendeth his love towards believers, in that Chri&s;t died for <HI>them</HI>: ver&s;e 9th, that believers are ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t's blood, and &s;aved from wrath through him: ver&s;e 10th, that believers are reconciled to God by the death of Chri&s;t and &s;aved by his life: ver&s;e 11th, that believers glory in God through Chri&s;t, by whom they have received the atonement or reconciliation.&mdash;Now what is the con|&s;equence really following from the&s;e premi&s;es, a&s;cribing to believers the&s;e peculiar and exclu&s;ive privileges? Is it that by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t the free gift unto ju&s;|tification of life, is come upon all mankind, believers and unbelievers? By no means: any man, without the aid of in&s;piration, would be a&s;hamed to draw &s;uch a con&s;equence from &s;uch premi&s;es. The only ju&s;t con&s;equence of the&s;e premi&s;es, is that which has been generally taken to be the meaning of the 18th ver&s;e; viz That as by the of|fence of one, Adam, judgment to condemnation came upon all mankind who were his &s;eed; even &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the free gift unto ju&s;|tification of life, came upon all <HI>his</HI> &s;eed, who are believers only, and who are the only per&s;ons of whom the apo&s;tle had been &s;peaking in the premi&s;es.&mdash;May I not now adopt the &s;ame bold language which Dr. C. often u&s;es concerning his comments on &s;cripture, that no other &s;en&s;e than this, can be put on this 18th ver&s;e without making the apo&s;tle argue inconclu&s;ively?</P>
<P>I KNOW very well that the Doctor under&s;tood differ|ently the whole pa&s;&s;age from the beginning of this chap|ter to the 12th ver&s;e. But as his whole argument from Rom. V. 12. to the end, in the pre&s;ent view of it, de|pends on his different con&s;truction of ver&s;e 1&mdash;12; it is not &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the Doctor <HI>under&s;tood</HI> that pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="167" REF="022478_0172_0FB93301F52C3690">
differently, or that it is <HI>capable</HI> of a different con&s;truction. It mu&s;t be &s;hown that it is not capable of the con&s;truction which is given above; and that the Doctor's con&s;truction mu&s;t be the true one. Let us therefore attend to his con|&s;truction and his rea&s;ons in &s;upport of it.</P>
<P>THE con&s;truction is, that the la&s;t ver&s;e of the preceding chapter, the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, ver&s;es, and the latter part of the 11th ver&s;e of this chapter, are &s;poken of all mankind. The rea&s;ons which he a&s;&s;igns for &s;uch an under&s;tanding of tho&s;e ver&s;es, are</P>
<P N="1">(1.) THAT in the 6th ver&s;e Chri&s;t is &s;aid to die for <HI>the ungodly.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 35.</NOTE> But if we &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, that by the ungodly here are meant tho&s;e only, who afterward and during this life become godly or believers, though Chri&s;t died for them while ungodly or con&s;idering them as ungodly, the Doctor has given no confutation of &s;uch a con&s;truction. Therefore he had no right to expect, that it would be reject|ed by any one who &s;hould choo&s;e to adopt it.&mdash;Or if we allow, that Chri&s;t did die for all men in this &s;en&s;e, that he died to introduce a di&s;pen&s;ation of grace which &s;hould offer &s;alvation to all, and invite all to it, and to u&s;e Dr. C's own expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>to put all into &s;alvable circum&s;tances</HI>; nothing will hence fellow favourable to the actual &s;alvation of all men, or to the Doctor's argument from Rom. V. 12, &amp;c. It will not follow, that all will accept the invitations to &s;alvation and act upon them. Still the <HI>we</HI> and <HI>us,</HI> which occur &s;o often from the 1&s;t to the 12th ver&s;e, and parti|cularly in ver&s;e 6th, may mean believers only.</P>
<P N="2">(2.)
<Q>IT is a gro&s;s mi&s;take to think, that the apo&s;tle in this 9th ver&s;e is &s;peaking of that ju&s;tification he had in the 1&s;t ver&s;e connected with faith; and for this deci&s;ive rea&s;on, becau&s;e&mdash;as &s;alvation from wrath is one thing e&s;&s;entially included in that ju&s;tification which is the re&s;ult of true faith; it would be ridiculous to argue, <HI>much more</HI> being ju&s;tified, meaning hereby this ju&s;tification, we &s;hall be &s;aved from wrath.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 37.</NOTE>&mdash;But did Dr. C. entertain the opinion, that ju&s;tification and &s;alvation are one and the &s;ame? Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s: he was then ju&s;tified: but he did not then receive complete &s;alvation. Believers being in this life ju&s;tified by faith, have peace with God, according to the 1&s;t ver&s;e of this chapter, as Dr. C. allows.
<PB N="168" REF="022478_0173_0FB9330373946FF0">
Yet they are not in this life &s;aved from wrath in the &s;en&s;e they will be, at the day of judgment. Therefore, how|ever Dr. C. <HI>a&s;&s;erts</HI> it, it does not <HI>appear</HI> to be ridiculous to argue, that believers being in this life ju&s;tified by faith in the blood of Chri&s;t, &s;hall at the day of judgment, much more be &s;aved from wrath through him. Is it ridiculous to argue, that Abraham being ju&s;tified by faith here, will much more be &s;aved from wrath hereafter?</P>
<P N="3">(3)
<Q>THE particle <GAP DESC="foreign">, now, connected with the ju&s;ti|fication here treated of, is emphatical, making it clear, that the apo&s;tle is not to be under&s;tood of ju&s;tification at the great day; but of ju&s;tification that had at that time been completed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 37.</NOTE></Q>
&mdash;No body pretends, that the a|po&s;tle means a ju&s;tification at the great day. It is allowed on all hands, that he means a ju&s;tification, which had at that pre&s;ent time been completed. But what follows hence? Did Dr. C. imagine, that believers are not in a proper &s;en&s;e completely ju&s;tified in this life? And that the ju&s;tification of Abraham, Rahab, &amp;c. was in no proper &s;en&s;e completed before their death, or before the great day? Concerning the former, it is expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid, that he believ|ed God, and it <HI>was</HI> counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;that faith <HI>was</HI> reckoned to Abraham for righteou&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c, and concerning the latter, <HI>was</HI> not Rahab the harlot ju&s;tified, &amp;c? Nor is it material to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, whether this ju&s;tification of Rahab mean a ju&s;tification by God, or a manife&s;tative ju&s;tification, proving, that &s;he was ju&s;tified in in the &s;ight of God; becau&s;e the latter, equally as the for|mer, implies that &s;he was then ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>THAT believers are in this life ju&s;tified in a peculiar &s;en&s;e, is further taught in 1 Cor. VI, 11,
<Q>And &s;uch were &s;ome of you: but ye are wa&s;hed, but ye are &s;anctified, but ye <HI>are ju&s;tified</HI> in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the &s;pirit of our God.</Q>
&mdash;I pre&s;ume it will be grant|ed, that pardon or forgivene&s;s is an e&s;&s;ential part of ju&s;tifi|cation, and that when a man is forgiven by God, he is ju&s;|tified by God. But that believers are forgiven in this life, is evident from the following texts, Mat. IX, 2, "Son, thy &s;ins be forgiven thee." See al&s;o, Mark, II, 5, and Luke V, 20,&mdash;Col. II, 13.
<Q>And you being dead in your &s;ins, and the uncircumci&s;ion of your fle&s;h, hath
<PB N="169" REF="022478_0174_0FB93305DC50BBC8">
he quickened together with him, <HI>having forgiven</HI> you all tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</Q>
1 John II. 12,
<Q>I write unto you, little children, becau&s;e your &s;ins are forgiven you, for his name's &s;ake.</Q></P>
<P>But why need I produce proofs of what Dr. C. grants, though it &s;eems in his comment on the 9th ver&s;e, he had forgotten it? In his comment on the 1&s;t ver&s;e, &amp;c, he &s;peaks of
<Q>the ju&s;tified by faith, as glorying in hope of the glory of God&mdash;and in their &s;ufferings&mdash; becau&s;e they knew that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope.</Q>
The Doctor, as the apo&s;tle did before him, evidently con&s;iders the&s;e things as taking place in this life. Indeed the con|trary cannot be pretended without the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdity. He al&s;o con&s;iders the&s;e views and affections as peculiar to the <HI>ju&s;tified by faith.</HI> Therefore &s;ome men are completely ju&s;tified by faith in this life: at lea&s;t &s;o completely, as to render the 9th ver&s;e properly applicable to them. There|fore his argument from <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>now,</HI> that the ju&s;tification &s;po|ken of in the 9th ver&s;e, is not peculiar to believers, proves nothing.</P>
<P>BESIDE, Dr. C. could not, without the mo&s;t glaring ab&s;urdity and incon&s;i&s;tency, under&s;tand this 9th ver&s;e of all mankind: becau&s;e the per&s;ons here referred to, &s;hall be <HI>&s;aved from wrath.</HI> But according to the Doctor &s;ome men will not be &s;aved from wrath, they will &s;uffer all that wrath to which they are liable on the footing of &s;trict ju&s;|tice: they will &s;uffer according to their &s;ins, according to their crimes, and their de&s;erts, and &s;o that the whole threatened penalty will be executed on them.</P>
<P N="4">(4) DOCTOR C. argues, that becau&s;e it is &s;aid in ver&s;e 10th, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God; by the <HI>we</HI> here, we mu&s;t under&s;tand, not believers only, but all mankind: or becau&s;e, as the Doctor paraphra&s;es the words, <HI>while</HI> they were enemies, they were reconciled; therefore this reconciliation cannot mean the cordial re|conciliation of true believers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 38.</NOTE> The force of this argu|ment wholly depends on this &s;uppo&s;ition, that the per&s;ons here intended, were reconciled, and yet after the recon|ciliation was effected, they &s;till remained enemies. But what nece&s;&s;ity of this glo&s;s of the text? Why may it not mean this merely, that when the per&s;ons here intended
<PB N="170" REF="022478_0175_0FB9330810F5E758">
were going on in their enmity, they were arre&s;ted by the grace of God, reclaimed from their enmity, and reconciled to God? There appears to be nothing ab&s;urd or unu&s;ual in this expre&s;&s;ion under&s;tood in this &s;en&s;e. If it &s;hould be &s;aid, When a &s;ubject was waging war again&s;t his &s;overeign, and was in actual battle with the troops of his &s;overeign, he was reconciled to him; the expre&s;&s;ion would not natu|rally imply, and no man would under&s;tand it to mean, that notwith&s;tanding the reconciliation, he &s;till continued a fix|ed and malicious enemy to his &s;overeign No man would under&s;tand the expre&s;&s;ion in any other &s;en&s;e than this, that in the mid&s;t of the war and battle, he was &s;truck with con|viction of his wickedne&s;s, and became cordially reconciled to his &s;overeign.</P>
<P>IF the Doctor depended on the original words <GAP DESC="foreign">, to make out that the reconciliation here in|tended took place, while the per&s;ons &s;poken of remained enemies; he might as conclu&s;ively have argued, that the per&s;on mentioned in Joh. IX, 25, (<GAP DESC="foreign">) had his &s;ight re&s;tored to him, while he remained perfectly blind; and that Saul went to Dama&s;cus, with the expectation of bringing certain per&s;ons to Jeru&s;alem, who at the &s;ame time &s;hould &s;till remain at Dama&s;cus, (<GAP DESC="foreign">) Act. XXII, 5.</P>
<P>AT length we come to the Doctor's expo&s;ition of the 11th ver&s;e, to which his critici&s;m, on all the preceding ver|&s;es refers. He tells us, The meaning plainly and briefly is,
<Q>We believers glory in God of our intere&s;t, and relation to him, as our covenant God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom we were &s;o changed in our &s;tate, <HI>while ene|mies</HI>&mdash;in common with the re&s;t of mankind, as to be ca|pable of&mdash;final ju&s;tification upon the foot of faith.</Q>
On this it may be remarked, That if by
<Q>intere&s;t in and covenant relation to God,</Q>
Dr. C. meant any thing different from that &s;tate of reconciliation, which is obtain|ed by Chri&s;t, and which is mentioned in the latter part of this ver&s;e, it does not appear, that the text gives him any warrant to in&s;ert that intere&s;t, &amp;c. in his comment, as a ground of rejoicing or glorying. I appeal to the reader, whether the mo&s;t natural &s;en&s;e of the text be not this, We believers glory in God, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as having by Chri&s;t received reconciliation; or <HI>for this rea&s;on,</HI> that of God's rich grace through Chri&s;t, we have
<PB N="171" REF="022478_0176_0FB93309730B8140">
obtained reconciliation with God. Otherwi&s;e, why is the circum&s;tance of our receiving the reconciliation by Chri&s;t mentioned in this connection with our glorying in God? Be&s;ide, to glory in God as our covenant God, and to glory in him on account of our reconciliation with him, is one and the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>THE glorying of which the apo&s;tle &s;peaks, is through Chri&s;t; and this implies, that it is on account of &s;ome be|nefit or ble&s;&s;ing received through Chri&s;t: and what this ble&s;&s;ing is, which the apo&s;tle had in view, and which he con&s;idered as the ground of glorying to believers, he im|mediately explains in the&s;e words, <HI>by whom we have re|ceived the reconciliation,</HI> that reconciliation of which he had been &s;peaking in the 10th ver&s;e.&mdash;But if the recon|ciliation, which the apo&s;tle makes, the great ground of re|joicing or glorying to believers, be, as Dr. C. holds, com|mon to believers and unbelievers? then the great ground of glorying to believers is not any ble&s;&s;ing peculiar to be|lievers; but &s;omething common to all mankind; and therefore unbelievers have ju&s;t the &s;ame rea&s;on to glory in that ble&s;&s;ing as believers; which is no more credible than the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation, and wants as much proof as that doctrine; and therefore cannot be admitted as any evidence of the truth of that doctrine.</P>
<P>I BEG the reader's patience, while I make a few other remarks on Dr. C's con&s;truction of the pa&s;&s;age from Rom. IV. 25, to Chap. V. 12; and I wi&s;h the reader to keep before him the pa&s;&s;age it&s;elf, while he follows me in the&s;e remarks.</P>
<P>THIS whole pa&s;&s;age is expre&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t per&s;on, and is manife&s;tly one continued di&s;cour&s;e. Yet Dr. C. was of the opinion, that in this &s;hort pa&s;&s;age of only twelve ver|&s;es, the per&s;ons, or the <HI>we, us</HI> and <HI>our,</HI> which occur in al|mo&s;t every &s;entence, are &s;hifted no le&s;s than four times. In the la&s;t ver&s;e of Chap. IV, it was his opinion, that all men are intended: that from the fir&s;t to the &s;ixth ver&s;e of Chapter V, only believers are intended: that from the 6th to the 11th ver&s;e all men are intended: that in the former part of the 11th ver&s;e believers only are intended: that in the latter part of the 11th ver&s;e all men are again inten|ded. I beg leave to &s;et down this whole pa&s;&s;age, accor|ding to the Doctor's explanation, together with the text it&s;elf:&mdash;Thus<Q><TEXT>

<P>HOW &s;trange, that in a continued di&s;cour&s;e all in the fir&s;t per&s;on plural, the <HI>we</HI> and <HI>us</HI> &s;hould be changed back|ward and forward <HI>four times!</HI> What torturing of the &s;cripture is here! At this rate, what di&s;cour&s;e in the world will be intelligible? How will it be po&s;&s;ible for any man, and e&s;pecially for the common people, for whom as well as for the learned, the &s;criptures were written, to un|der&s;tand them?</P>
<P>BUT this is not all. By this various reference of the pronouns <HI>we</HI> and <HI>us,</HI> the rea&s;oning of the apo&s;tle is render|ed utterly inconclu&s;ive, in almo&s;t every &s;tep of it. Thus the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the fifth Chapter is manife&s;tly brought in by the apo&s;tle, as a con&s;equence drawn from the la&s;t ver&s;e of the preceding Chapter. But from the con&s;ideration, that Chri&s;t died and ro&s;e to put all men into a capacity of ob|taining ju&s;tification at the great day, it by no means fol|lows, that <HI>believers are now</HI> ju&s;tified by faith, and have peace with God. Ver&s;e 9th, if it be ever &s;o true, that all men are put into a <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of &s;alvation, it by no means follows, that all men will be <HI>actually &s;aved.</HI> It no more
<PB N="174" REF="022478_0179_0FB9331720893D28">
follows, than from the opportunity given all men, of ob|taining &s;alvation immediately after this life, it follows, that all will actually be &s;aved immediately after this life: Or than from the opportunity of entering the land of Ca|naan, given all that generation, which came out of Egypt, it followed, that all that generation would in fact enter that land: Or than from the opportunity given any man to be|come rich or honorable, it follows, that he will in fact be|come rich or honorable. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is equally applicable to the 10th ver&s;e. What was before ob&s;erved concerning the 11th ver&s;e, under&s;tood in Dr. C's &s;en&s;e, needs not to be repeated.</P>
<P>BUT what is of chief importance is, that according to the Doctor's con&s;truction, there is no argumentative con|nection between the 11th and the 12th, or which is the &s;ame thing, between the 11th and the 18th ver&s;es. If the Doctor's &s;en&s;e of the 11th and 18th ver&s;es be true, the latter is no ju&s;t con&s;equence from the former. The Doc|tor's &s;en&s;e of the 11th ver&s;e is, that all men through Chri&s;t have received a po&s;&s;ibility of final &s;alvation; and his &s;en&s;e of the 18th ver&s;e is, that all men will actually be &s;aved. But if it be ever &s;o true, that all men have received a po&s;|&s;ibility or opportunity of final &s;alvation, it does not fol|low, that all will actually be &s;aved. Yet as the 12th or 18th ver&s;e, (the intermediate ver&s;es being a parenthe&s;is) is a deduction from the 11th, the la&s;t of the propo&s;itions ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ed, &s;hould ju&s;tly follow from the other; other|wi&s;e the apo&s;tle argues inconclu&s;ively. And as the Doc|tor's glo&s;s of the&s;e two ver&s;es makes the apo&s;tle rea&s;on in|conclu&s;ively, we may be &s;ure, that he has not given the true &s;en&s;e of them.&mdash;But according to the common un|der&s;tanding of the&s;e ver&s;es, the rea&s;oning is clear and cer|tain. For if believers have obtained through Chri&s;t a cor|dial reconciliation and peace with God, then certainly tho&s;e &s;ame believers will, in the &s;ame way, obtain eternal life and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>THAT the 12th, and therefore the 18th ver&s;e, is an in|ference from the 11th, is, I think, manife&s;t from a careful peru&s;al of the pa&s;&s;age, and it is at lea&s;t implicitly granted by Dr. C. He expre&s;&s;ly &s;ays, that the <HI>therefore</HI> in the be|ginning of the 18th ver&s;e,
<Q>is the &s;ame which began the 12th ver&s;e. The prota&s;is or fir&s;t part of the compari|&s;on was there entered upon, but left unfini&s;hed. 'Tis

<Q>I &s;ay, therefore, (to re&s;ume now and pur|&s;ue the compari&s;on I began in the 12th ver&s;e) as it was by the lap&s;e of the one man, Adam,</Q>
&amp;c.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 26.</NOTE> The Doc|tor al&s;o quotes Dr. Doddridge's a&s;&s;ertion, that
<Q>the 12th ver&s;e is an inference from the 11th,</Q>
and does not con|tradict that a&s;&s;ertion, though he labours through a num|ber of pages, to affix a different &s;en&s;e from that of Dr. Doddridge, to the 11th ver&s;e, that thus he may evade the con&s;truction of the 18th ver&s;e, which Dr. Doddridge had given, and e&s;tabli&s;h his own. But all this was needle&s;s, if indeed the 12th and 18th ver&s;es are not an inference from the 11th.&mdash;Nor is there any incon&s;i&s;tence in the opinion, that the 18th ver&s;e may be at the &s;ame time an in|ference from the 11th and from the 15th, 16th and 17th ver&s;es. True and &s;ufficient premi&s;es or rea&s;ons of the pro|po&s;ition of the 18th ver&s;e, may be contained in the 11th ver&s;e. Tho&s;e rea&s;ons maybe explained, and even others added in the 15th, 16th and 17th ver&s;es, which fall into a parenthe&s;is; and the 18th ver&s;e may contain an inference ju&s;tly deducible from either, or from both.</P>
<P>I AM indeed &s;en&s;ible, that Dr. C. in his paraphra&s;e of the 12th ver&s;e, does not con&s;ider it as an inference from the 11th; but the 11th as deducible by way of inference from the 12th, in this manner: Becau&s;e &s;in and death came upon all men by Adam, therefore all men have obtained a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t. His words are,
<Q>For this cau&s;e or rea&s;on, we have received reconciliation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, namely, becau&s;e as &s;in entered into the world by the one man, Adam,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 23.</NOTE></Q>
&amp;c. But this is as &s;urpri&s;ing as any part of Dr. C's truly &s;urpri&s;ing expo&s;ition of this chapter. In the fir&s;t place, it is a mere conjecture, un&s;upported by any thing, but pure imagination. In the &s;econd place, to apply this paraphra&s;e to the 18th ver&s;e, which is but the full expre&s;&s;ion of the 12th, it will &s;tand thus: For this cau&s;e or rea&s;on all men have received a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation, namely, that as by the offence of one, judg|ment came upon all men to condemnation, even &s;o, by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men to ac|tual &s;alvation. Or more briefly thus: The rea&s;on, why
<PB N="176" REF="022478_0181_0FB9331B96E0F6D0">
all men have obtained a <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of &s;alvation, is, that &s;al|vation is <HI>actually</HI> come upon all men: Or to place the &s;en|tence in its proper arrangement, Salvation is actually come upon all men; therefore all men have received a po&s;&s;ibili|ty of &s;alvation.&mdash;On this rea&s;oning I need make no re|mark.&mdash;It is not however probable, that the Doctor was &s;en&s;ible, that his paraphra&s;e of the 12th ver&s;e, appli|ed to the 18th, would come to this. Nor is the rea&s;on ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ed, that which the Doctor believed to be the true one, why we have received the reconciliation. But that which in the Doctor's opinion was the true rea|&s;on, he expre&s;&s;ly declares to be,
<Q>That it was in &s;uch a way, viz. by the offence of one, that judgment came upon all men to condemnation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 30.</NOTE></Q>
&mdash;Who is an&s;wer|able for this incon&s;i&s;tency, I need not inform the read|er.</P>
<P>BEFORE I di&s;mi&s;s this part of Dr. C's book, I cannot but ob&s;erve, that he &s;peaks of a double ju&s;tification,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 38.</NOTE> the one meaning ab&s;olution at the great day; the other mean|ing the advantageous &s;tate, or the po&s;&s;ibility of the &s;alva|tion of all mankind through Chri&s;t. It &s;eems then that the Doctor had forgotten, that he had but a few pages be|fore made out a threefold ju&s;tification: THe fir&s;t kind con|&s;i&s;ting in the introduction to a capacity or po&s;&s;ibility of &s;al|vation through Chri&s;t: The &s;econd in the ju&s;tification of believers, who have peace with God while in this life; &s;uch was the ju&s;tification of Abraham: The third in ab&s;olution at the great day.&mdash;But when any thing is abundantly multiplied, no wonder if the author him&s;elf of that multi|plication forgets the number of units contained in his own product.</P>
<P>DR. C. &s;ays,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 32.</NOTE> It can be no other than a flat contradic|tion to the expre&s;s words of the Apo&s;tle him&s;elf, to &s;ay that in the latter part of the compari&s;on in the 18th ver&s;e, the words <HI>all men</HI> are not u&s;ed in the &s;ame exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, as in the former part of that ver&s;e. This is indeed a &s;trong, po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion, but where is the rea&s;on to &s;up|port it? Be&s;ide; he thought it no flat contradiction to the expre&s;s words of the Apo&s;tle, to &s;ay that <HI>we</HI> in the former part of the 11th ver&s;e, is not u&s;ed in the &s;ame exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e as in the latter part of that ver&s;e: nor any flat contradiction to the words of our Saviour, to &s;ay, that the word <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> is not u&s;ed in the &s;ame exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e in

<Q>The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, but the righteous into everla&s;ting life.</Q></P>
<P>BUT it is time we &s;hould proceed to the other argument of Dr. C. to prove that univer&s;al &s;alvation is taught in Rom. V. 12, &amp;c. viz.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE advantage by Chri&s;t <HI>exceeds,</HI> abounds beyond, the di&s;advantage by Adam. But unle&s;s all men be &s;aved, the former "&s;inks below" the latter.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 32 &amp; 81, &amp;c.</NOTE>&mdash;It is granted, that the advantage by Chri&s;t, to tho&s;e who obtain &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, exceeds, and abounds beyond, the di&s;advantage by Adam. But the que&s;tion is, whether this &s;aving ad|vantage extend to all tho&s;e, to whom the di&s;advantage by Adam extended. That it does extend to all the &s;ame &s;ub|jects to whom the di&s;advantage by Adam extended, is hol|den by Dr. C. But how does he prove it? By no other arguments than tho&s;e which we have already particularly con&s;idered; and whether they be conclu&s;ive, is &s;ubmitted to the reader,&mdash;Dr. C. did not imagine, that the advan|tage by Chri&s;t was more exten&s;ive, or extended to a great|er number of per&s;ons, than the di&s;advantage by Adam. He believed, that they both extended to all mankind.&mdash; Therefore, the &s;uper-abounding, the exce&s;s, or &s;urplu&s;age of the advantage by Chri&s;t, does not con&s;i&s;t in the extent of it, but in &s;omething el&s;e, and that &s;omething el&s;e may exi&s;t, though the extent as to the number of per&s;ons be the &s;ame, or even le&s;s than the extent of the di&s;advantage by Adam.</P>
<P>IF the glory of God, and the happine&s;s of the created &s;y&s;tem, be more advanced by the &s;alvation of a part of the human race, and by the rejection of the re&s;t, than they would have been, if Adam had never fallen; then &s;urely the advantage by Chri&s;t on the general &s;cale, does not "&s;ink below" the di&s;advantage by Adam: and to a&s;&s;ert, that the divine glory and the happine&s;s of the created &s;y|&s;tem would be mo&s;t advanced by the &s;alvation of all men, is to beg material points in que&s;tion.&mdash;But if Dr. C. mean, that if all be not &s;aved by Chri&s;t, then the ad|vantage by Chri&s;t to tho&s;e who &s;hall be finally mi&s;erable, "&s;inks below" the di&s;advantage by Adam to the &s;ame per&s;ons; I grant it, and apprehend no di&s;advantage to my cau&s;e by the conce&s;&s;ion. For it is granting no more than
<PB N="178" REF="022478_0183_0FB9331F40CB0C78">
is implied in the very propo&s;ition, which I endeavour to defend, that all men will not be &s;aved.</P>
<P>I HAVE now fini&s;hed my remarks on Dr. C's argument from Rom. V, 12, &amp;c.&mdash;If the reader think I have been prolix in the&s;e remarks, I hope he will remember how pro|lix the Doctor was in his argument from this pa&s;&s;age; and I pre&s;ume he will not think it unrea&s;onable to take up nineteen pages in an&s;wering &s;ixty-nine.</P>
<P>IT is now left to the reader to judge, whether it be cer|tain, that becau&s;e the word <HI>many</HI> in the former part of the 15th and 19th ver&s;es means <HI>all</HI> men, it means the &s;ame in the latter part of tho&s;e ver&s;es:&mdash;Whether it be certain, that the word <HI>many</HI> means all men, becau&s;e the article is joined with it, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the many</HI>:&mdash;Whether becau&s;e the words <HI>all</HI> men in the former part of the 18th ver&s;e, mean all mankind, they certainly mean the &s;ame in the latter part of that ver&s;e:&mdash;Whether becau&s;e the advan|tage by Chri&s;t exceeds the di&s;advantage by Adam, it cer|tainly follow, that the advantage to every individual man, will exceed the di&s;advantage to that man.</P>

which

are &s;uppo&s;ed by Dr. C. to hold forth the &s;alvation of all men. But the main que&s;tion here is, what is the meaning of the word <HI>creature.</HI> Dr. C. &s;uppo&s;es it means <HI>the hu|man race.</HI> Others &s;uppo&s;e it means the whole of the cre|ation which was made for the &s;ake of men, and is &s;ubjected to their u&s;e.&mdash;Be&s;ide the word <HI>creature,</HI> the following words and expre&s;&s;ions,
<Q>manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God</Q>
&mdash;"vanity"&mdash;"willingly"&mdash;
<Q>bondage of cor|ruption</Q>
&mdash;are all under&s;tood differently by Dr. C. and by tho&s;e who believe in endle&s;s puni&s;hment. Let us there|fore attend to them re&s;pectively.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE meaning of the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>creature</HI> or <HI>creation,</HI> is to be &s;ought. It may not be impertinent to inform the reader who is unacquainted with the original, that the word tran&s;lated creature in the 19th, 20th and 21&s;t ver&s;es, is the very &s;ame which in the 22d ver&s;e is tran&s;lated <HI>crea|tion;</HI> and doubtle&s;s whatever be the meaning of it, it ought to have been tran&s;lated uniformly throughout this pa&s;&s;age.&mdash;Dr. C. was of opinion that it means all man|kind or the rational creation of this world. His rea&s;ons for this opinion are, that
<Q><HI>earne&s;t expectation, groaning, travailing together in pain,</HI> are more naturally and obvi|ou&s;ly applicable to the rational, than the inanimate</Q>
[and brutal] "creation"&mdash;
<Q>that <GAP DESC="foreign">, the <HI>whole cre|ation,</HI> is never u&s;ed (one di&s;puted text only excepted, Col. I. 15.) to &s;ignify more than the whole moral cre|ation, or all mankind</Q>
&mdash;that
<Q>it would be highly incongruous, to give this &s;tyle</Q>
[the whole creation]
<Q>to the inferior or le&s;s valuable part, wholly leaving out the mo&s;t excellent</Q>
part, mankind.</P>

the meaning is, that <HI>men</HI> &s;aw it and fled; that men were driven back; that men &s;kipped like rams and like lambs&punc; it will prove, that Jer. XLVII. 6,
<Q>O thou &s;word of the Lord, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thy&s;elf into thy &s;cabbard, re&s;t and be &s;till;</Q>

<Q>I will ran&s;om them from the power of the grave: I will redeem them from death. O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy de&s;truction;</Q>
means that God will be the plagues and de&s;truction of <HI>men</HI>: and when once it is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, that death and the grave mean men, as men are to be ran&s;omed from the grave and redeemed from death, it will follow that men are to be ran&s;omed from them&s;elves and redeemed from them&s;elves.&mdash;But there is no end to the ab&s;urdities which will follow from this mode of con|&s;truing the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>THE truth is, that the figure of &s;peech, whereby inani|mate things are repre&s;ented as living, &s;en&s;ible and rational per&s;ons, and are addre&s;&s;ed as &s;uch, is very common in &s;cripture. Be&s;ide the in&s;tances already mentioned, I beg leave to refer to the following: Deut. XXXII. 1.
<Q>Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will &s;peak; hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.</Q>
P&s;al. LXV. 12, 13.
<Q>The little hills rejoice on every &s;ide. The pa&s;tures&mdash;the val|leys&mdash;&s;hout for joy: they al&s;o &s;ing.</Q>
I&s;ai. LV. 12.
<Q>The mountains and the hills &s;hall break forth before you into &s;inging, and all the trees of the field &s;hall clap their hands.</Q>

<Q>For the &s;tone &s;hall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber &s;hall an&s;wer it.</Q>

<Q>Tabor and Her|mon &s;hall rejoice in thy name.</Q>
P&s;al. XCVII, 1.
<Q>The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of the i&s;les be glad thereof.</Q>
I&s;ai. XXIV, 4.
<Q>The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world monrneth, langui&s;heth and fadeth away.</Q>
See al&s;o P&s;al. XCVIII, 8. I&s;ai. XVI, 8. XXXV, 1, 2. XLIX, 13. Lev. XVIII, 28, &amp;c, &amp;c.</P>
<P>NOW rejoicing, &s;houting for joy, &s;inging, breaking forth into &s;inging, clapping of hands, crying out, an&s;wer|ing, mourning, langui&s;hing, &amp;c, are certainly in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages applied to inanimate creatures. But they are ap|plicable to &s;uch creatures, not more naturally and obviou&s;|ly, than earne&s;t expectation, groaning and travailing in pain.</P>
<P>THOUGH the Doctor thinks the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions not proper|ly applicable to any other creatures than mankind; yet he him&s;elf applies them to mankind in no other &s;en&s;e, than
<PB N="181" REF="022478_0186_0FB933248B209260">
that in which they are applicable to the brutal creation. The &s;en&s;e in which he &s;uppo&s;es all mankind <HI>long</HI> and <HI>wait</HI> for the manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God, is, that they
<Q>groan under the afflictions of this world, &s;en&s;ible of its imperfections, and con&s;equently de&s;ire &s;omething bet|ter.</Q>
Now the calamities of the world fall not on the rational part of it only, but on all the animal, &s;en&s;itive parts, and con&s;equently they, as well as mankind,
<Q>de|&s;ire &s;omething better.</Q>
From the&s;e calamities and mi|&s;eries the animal parts of the world will be delivered, at the manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God.</P>
<P>FURTHER, the inanimate parts of the world, once per|&s;onified, as they are in innumerable in&s;tances throughout the &s;criptures, may as properly have the particular per&s;on|al affections, actions and &s;ufferings, of <HI>expectation, waiting, groaning, travailing,</HI> &amp;c. a&s;cribed to them, as any other per&s;onal affections, actions or &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>IF any &s;hould think it impo&s;&s;ible for brutes and inanimate matter to enjoy the liberty of the children of God, and therefore that it is ab&s;urd to repre&s;ent, that they &s;hall be delivered into that liberty: let it be ob&s;erved, that though this would be ab&s;urd, while they are repre&s;ented to be &s;till brutes and inanimate matter; yet as &s;oon as they are repre&s;ented to be intelligent beings, the ab&s;urdity cea&s;es. There is in this ca&s;e no more ab&s;urdity in repre&s;enting them, as brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God after the re&s;urrection, than in repre&s;enting, that they rejoice in the manife&s;tation of the divine perfections and in the prevalence of true religion in this world; as is done in the pa&s;&s;ages before quoted.</P>
<P>OBJECTION. Though there would be no ab&s;urdity in figuratively repre&s;enting brutes and inanimate creatures, in this world, as rejoicing in the manife&s;tations of divine power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, yet there is an ab&s;urdity in the repre&s;entation, that they &s;hall be brought into the li|berty of the children of God, after the end of the world; becau&s;e then they will be annihilated; and to repre&s;ent that after they &s;hall be annihilated, they &s;till enjoy glori|ous liberty, is a gro&s;s incon&s;i&s;tency. This is the objection in its full &s;trength.&mdash;Let us attend to it.</P>
<P>IT is not agreed by all writers, that the liberty of the children of God mentioned in the 21&s;t ver&s;e, means that liberty and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s which they &s;hall enjoy after the re|&s;urrection
<PB N="182" REF="022478_0187_0FB93325EEF3FD30">
and general judgment; &s;ome are of the opinion, that it means that liberty which they &s;hall enjoy on earth in the latter days, when Chri&s;t &s;hall reign on earth for a thou&s;and years.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gui&s;e's Paraphra&s;e in loc. and Hopkins's Inquiry concerning the Future State of the Wicked. P. <HI>101.</HI></NOTE> If this be the true &s;en&s;e of the apo&s;tle, the objection vani&s;hes at once, as the brutal and inanimate creation will then be in as real exi&s;tence, as they are now.</P>
<P>NOR is it agreed among writers, that this world will, after the general judgment be annihilated. It is the opi|nion of many, and of great authority too, that after a purification by fire, it will be re&s;tored to a far more glori|ous &s;tate, than that in which it is at pre&s;ent, and will for|ever be the place of the re&s;idence of holy and happy be|ings.&mdash;If this be true, the objection again vani&s;hes.</P>
<P>FINALLY, if it be the real truth, that the brutal and material creation will be annihilated, after the general judgment, yet there is no ab&s;urdity in repre&s;enting, that it &s;hall be brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God. Wherein does the liberty of the children of God con&s;i&s;t? Doubtle&s;s in a great mea&s;ure in deliverance from &s;in, and from the influence of it in them&s;elves and others. So the brutal and material creation, even if it be annihi|lated, &s;hall be delivered from the power, abu&s;e and abomi|nable perver&s;ion of wicked men, to which it had been long &s;ubjected, and under which it had long groaned. There|fore this creation introduced as a rational per&s;on, may, without impropriety be repre&s;ented as earne&s;tly wi&s;hing for that deliverance. And as the deliverance from &s;in in them&s;elves and from the effects of &s;in in others, is at lea&s;t a great part of the liberty which the children of God &s;hall obtain after the general judgment; &s;o the afore&s;aid deli|verance of the creation may not improperly be called a deliverance into the liberty of the children of God, into a &s;imilar liberty, a like freedom from the tyranny, abu&s;es and perver&s;ions of wicked men. Or the &s;en&s;e may be a deliverance <HI>in, at,</HI> or <HI>on occa&s;ion of,</HI> the glorious liberty of the children of God. The prepo&s;ition <HI>us,</HI> is capable of this &s;en&s;e, and then the con&s;truction of this pa&s;&s;age will be, That the creation it&s;elf will be delivered from the bondage of corruption, at the time, or on occa&s;ion, of the glorious liberty or deliverance of the children of God.</P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 99.</NOTE>&mdash;This is a matter of im|portance, and requires particular attention.&mdash;The phra&s;e <GAP DESC="foreign">
is u&s;ed four times only in all the New Te&s;ta|ment, be&s;ide the in&s;tance which is now under con&s;ideration. The places are, Mark XVI. 15;

<P>AS to Mark XVI. 15, it is granted, that in that text <HI>every creature</HI> means <HI>human</HI> creature.&mdash;Though Dr. C. &s;ays, that Col. I. 15, is di&s;puted; yet he pretends not, that every creature here means mankind merely: nor does it appear, that the text is in this re&s;pect di&s;puted. It is indeed di&s;puted, whether <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>every creature,</HI> or rather, <HI>all the creation,</HI> refer to the new creation, i. e. the church, or to the old creation, which was made at the beginning of the world. It is al&s;o di&s;puted, whether Chri&s;t be &s;o the fir&s;t born of all the creation, as to be a creature him&s;elf; or whether he be the fir&s;t born in this &s;en&s;e only, that he is the heir, the head and Lord of all the creation. <GAP DESC="foreign">, in our ver&s;ion rendered fir&s;t-born, is by &s;ome ren|dered <HI>fir&s;t creator</HI> or <HI>producer,</HI> which gives a &s;till differ|ent &s;en&s;e to the pa&s;&s;age. But it does not appear, that it has ever been contended, that <GAP DESC="foreign">
<Q>&s;ignifies no more than all mankind.</Q>
For in whatever &s;en&s;e Chri&s;t is the fir&s;t-born of all the creation, he is the fir&s;t-born not only of the human race, but of all the creation ab&s;olute|ly. If it be &s;aid, that Chri&s;t is the fir&s;t-born of all the creation, as he is the fir&s;t creature which was made; this implies, that he was made not before all men only, but be|fore all creatures. If it be &s;aid, that he is the fir&s;t-born of all the creation, as he was begotten from eternity, and &s;o begotten before all the creation; &s;till he was in this &s;en&s;e begotten not before all men only, but before all crea|tures. If it be &s;aid, that he is the fir&s;t-born of all the creation, as he is the heir, the head, the Lord of all; &s;till in this &s;en&s;e he is the fir&s;t-born not of mankind only, but of all creatures.&mdash;What right then had Dr. C. to

<Q>&s;ignify more than the whole moral creation of this world, or all mankind?</Q></P>
<P>THE next pa&s;&s;age, in which <GAP DESC="foreign">
occurs, is Col. I. 23;
<Q>The go&s;pel, which was preached to every crea|ture under heaven.</Q>
The Doctor, who was well ac|quainted with the original, doubtle&s;s recollected, or at lea&s;t, he ought to have examined, and then he would have &s;een, that in the original it is,
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>in</HI> all the creation under heaven,</Q>
or in all the world. Surely the Doctor did not imagine, that the go&s;pel was preached <HI>within</HI> every man.</P>
<P>The other pa&s;&s;age is 1 Pet. II. 13,
<Q>Submit your|&s;elves to every ordinance of men;</Q>
<GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>every human creature.</HI> The que&s;tion is whether the&s;e words &s;ignify <HI>all mankind</HI>: and the very propo&s;ing of the que&s;tion, I pre&s;ume, &s;ugge&s;ts the an&s;wer. Will any man &s;ay, that every Chri&s;tian is required, either by rea&s;on or revelation, to &s;ubmit to every individual of the human race, whether man, woman or child; and whether the Chri&s;tian be a lord or a tenant, a king or a &s;ubject?&mdash; Be&s;ides; allowing that the phra&s;e as it &s;tands, means the hu|man race; the addition of <GAP DESC="foreign">
to <GAP DESC="foreign">
&s;hows that <GAP DESC="foreign">
without <GAP DESC="foreign">, would not &s;ignify the human race; otherwi&s;e why is it added? If the words in our language, <HI>every creature,</HI> mean always every human creature, it would be needle&s;s in any ca&s;e to in&s;ert the adjective <HI>human</HI>; and the very in&s;ertion of it would imply, that the writer or &s;peaker was of the opinion, that the bare words <HI>every crea|ture,</HI> were not certainly limited to human creatures, but would mo&s;t obviou&s;ly be taken in a greater extent.&mdash; This text therefore is &s;o far from a proof, that
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>every creature,</HI> is never u&s;ed in all the New Te&s;tament (except in one di&s;puted text) to &s;ignify more than all mankind;</Q>
that it is a clear proof,
<Q>that it does naturally &s;ignify more than all mankind,</Q>
and to make it &s;ignify no more, mu&s;t be limited by <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>human.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER all, the very drift of the apo&s;tle &s;hows, that in 1 Pet. II. 13, he was &s;o far from meaning all mankind by the expre&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="foreign">, that he meant either not one of the human race, or at mo&s;t but very few; that he meant either human laws and

<P>NOW let the reader judge, whether <GAP DESC="foreign">
be never u&s;ed in all the New Te&s;tament to &s;ignify more or le&s;s than all mankind; and whether of the four in&s;tances, in which it occurs, be&s;ide this of Rom. VIII, it do not in every one &s;ignify either more or le&s;s than all mankind; excepting Mark XVI, 15. And it is equally again&s;t Dr. C's argu|ment from Rom. VIII, whether it be u&s;ed in other places to &s;ignify more, or to &s;ignify le&s;s than all mankind. If it &s;ignify more in other places, it may &s;ignify more in Rom. VIII. If it &s;ignify le&s;s in other places, it may &s;ignify le&s;s in Rom. VIII: and when the apo&s;tle &s;ays,
<Q>the earne&s;t expectation of the creature waiteth for the manife&s;tati|on of the &s;ons of God,</Q>
he may mean that only believers and true Chri&s;tians, or the true church in all ages, as di&s;|tingui&s;hed from the Apo&s;tle, and fir&s;t converts, who had the fir&s;t fruits of the Spirit, are thus waiting, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IT is further to be ob&s;erved, that <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>creature</HI> or <HI>creation,</HI> without <GAP DESC="foreign">, is in the whole New Te&s;tament u|&s;ed ten times, be&s;ide the u&s;e of it in Rom.

<P>BUT it is time we attend to Dr. C's other rea&s;on for un|der&s;tanding the <HI>creature</HI> to mean all mankind; or at lea&s;t to include all mankind, if it mean any thing more. The rea&s;on is,</P>
<P N="3">3. That
<Q>it would be highly incongruous, to give this &s;tyle</Q>

<Q>to the inferior or le&s;s va|luable

part, wholly leaving out the mo&s;t excellent</Q>
part, mankind.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 98.</NOTE>&mdash;But is there more propriety in calling a &s;mall part, though it be the mo&s;t excellent part, <HI>the whole creation</HI>; than in calling by far the greater part <HI>the whole creation,</HI> though it be not &s;o excellent? The learned men in any nation, are, in &s;ome re&s;pects, the mo&s;t excellent part of the nation. But would it be more proper to call them, to the exclu&s;ion of all the unlearned the whole nation, than to call all the unlearned, to the exclu&s;ion of the few learned, the whole nation? The few truly vir|tuous and holy per&s;ons who love God &s;upremely and their neighbour as them&s;elves, and who find the &s;trait gate, are undoubtedly the mo&s;t excellent part of any nation. But would it be more proper to call them alone the whole nation, than to call the re&s;t alone, the whole nation? Tho&s;e of the apo&s;tolic age, who had the fir&s;t fruits of the Spirit, were, without doubt the mo&s;t excellent of that ge|neration. But would it therefore be more proper to call them as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of men, that whole ge|neration; than to call the re&s;t of men as di&s;tingui&s;hed from them, that whole generation?&mdash;Be&s;ide; propriety or congruity of language depends wholly on u&s;e. If the words <HI>creature, creation</HI> and <HI>whole creation</HI> be frequently in &s;cripture u&s;ed without any reference to mankind; then there is no incongruity in the &s;ame u&s;e of the &s;ame words, in this eighth chapter of Romans: and that this is the u&s;e, I appeal to the texts before quoted, which are all the texts in which the words here tran&s;lated <HI>crea|ture,</HI> and the <HI>whole creation,</HI> are to be found in all the &s;criptures.</P>
<P N="2">II. WE are to inquire into the meaning of the expre&s;|&s;ion, "manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God."&mdash;The&s;e words,
<Q>The earne&s;t expectation of the creature waiteth for the manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God;</Q>
are thus paraphra&s;ed by Dr. C.
<Q>The creature, the rational creature, man|kind in general, waits for the time when it &s;hall be re|vealed, that they are the &s;ons of God.</Q>
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 92.</NOTE> He here takes it for granted, that the word <HI>creature</HI> means <HI>man|kind.</HI> Whether this be a &s;uppo&s;ition ju&s;tly founded, is now &s;ubmitted to the reader who has peru&s;ed what has been offered on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="022478_0192_0FB93334F4E91310">BUT even on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the <HI>creature</HI> does mean <HI>mankind,</HI> how &s;trange it is that the waiting of this crea|ture for the manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God, &s;hould mean that this creature is waiting to be <HI>it&s;elf</HI> manife&s;ted to be the &s;ons of God! Would it not be &s;trange arguing, to &s;ay, that becau&s;e the Jews waited for the manife&s;tation of the Me&s;&s;iah, therefore they waited to have it manife&s;ted, that they were the Me&s;&s;iah! or that becau&s;e Simeon wait|ed for the manife&s;tation of the con&s;olation of I&s;rael; there|fore he waited to have it made apparent, that he was the con&s;olation of I&s;rael! Yet either of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions as naturally imports the &s;en&s;e which I have now given, as the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>the creature waiteth</HI> for the manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God, imports, that the "creature" or race of creatures. is waiting to have it
<Q>revealed that they are the &s;ons of God.</Q></P>
<P N="3">III. THE meaning of the word "vanity" next requires our attention.&mdash;By this word Dr. C. under&s;tands
<Q><HI>mortali|ty</HI> and all other unavoidable <HI>unhappine&s;s</HI> and <HI>imperfection</HI> of this pre&s;ent weak, frail, mortal &s;tate.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 104.</NOTE> Again, "mankind were &s;ubjected to vanity or <HI>mortality.</HI>"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 106.</NOTE>
<Q>God &s;ubjected mankind to vanity, i. e. the <HI>infelicities</HI> of this life.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> According to Dr. C. then, the vanity here &s;poken of is a <HI>natural</HI> evil. But it may at lea&s;t be made a que&s;tion, whether he be not mi&s;taken, and whether it be not a <HI>moral</HI> evil. The &s;ame word, <GAP DESC="foreign">, is u&s;ed twice more in the New Te&s;tament; Eph. IV. 17;
<Q>That ye henceforth walk, not as other gentiles walk in the <HI>va|nity</HI> of their mind, having the under&s;tanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God,</Q>
&amp;c; and 2 Pet. II. 18,
<Q>For when they &s;peak great &s;welling words of <HI>vanity.</HI></Q>
In the&s;e two, the only in&s;tances of its u&s;e in the New Te&s;tament, be&s;ide the text under con&s;ideration, it manife&s;tly means not a natural but a moral evil, either po&s;itive wickedne&s;s or at lea&s;t a &s;inful deficiency. Is not this a ground of pre&s;umption at lea&s;t, that al&s;o in Rom. VIII. 20, it means a moral evil?</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame &s;en&s;e <GAP DESC="foreign">
the adjective from which <GAP DESC="foreign">
is derived, is u&s;ed Jam. I. 26,
<Q>This man's religion is vain:</Q>
and 1 Pet. I. 18;
<Q>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things&mdash;from your <HI>vain</HI> conver&s;ation.</Q>
<GAP DESC="foreign">
is al&s;o u&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, Rom. I. 21;
<Q>Be|came

<P>BESIDES; the very nature of the ca&s;e &s;hows, that vani|ty in this in&s;tance was not u&s;ed by the apo&s;tle, in Dr. C's &s;en&s;e. According to his &s;en&s;e of <HI>vanity,</HI> the apo&s;tle under the influence of the Holy Gho&s;t, advances this propo&s;ition; The human race was made &s;ubject to
<Q>mortality, una|voidable unhappine&s;s and imperfection,</Q>
not willingly. But who ever &s;uppo&s;ed that the human race was made &s;ub|ject to the&s;e things willingly? or that any man, or any in|telligent being, ever cho&s;e to be &s;ubject to mortality and unhappine&s;s? This is a propo&s;ition too in&s;ignificant to be advanced by &s;o &s;en&s;ible and grave a writer as Paul, and under the in&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t too.&mdash;The Doc|tor &s;eems to have been aware of this objection to his con|&s;truction of <HI>vanity,</HI> and therefore &s;uppo&s;es the word <HI>willing|ly</HI> means, not what is naturally under&s;tood by it, <HI>a volun|tary con&s;ent of the heart</HI>; but that it means,
<Q>through &s;ome fault,</Q>
"by a criminal choice." Therefore</P>
<P N="4">IV. WE are to inquire into the meaning of the word <HI>willingly.</HI>&mdash;Is it not at fir&s;t blu&s;h a little extraordinary, that willingne&s;s mu&s;t certainly mean a fault, a criminal choice? Suppo&s;e an hi&s;torian &s;hould &s;ay, that <HI>Hugh Peters</HI> and others who were executed at the re&s;toration of <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd, were executed not <HI>willingly</HI>; mu&s;t we under|&s;tand him to mean, that they were not executed in con&s;e|quence of any fault of their own?&mdash;The original word <GAP DESC="foreign">
is u&s;ed once more only in all the New Te&s;tament, I Cor. IX. 17, "If I do this thing" (i. e. preach the go&s;pel)
<Q><HI>willingly,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, I have a reward: but if <HI>again&s;t my will,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, a di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel is committed unto me.</Q>
According to Dr. C's con&s;truction of <HI>wil|lingly</HI> in Rom. VIII, the meaning of the apo&s;tle is, If I preach the go&s;pel "through &s;ome fault of my own," or "by my own criminal choice," I have a reward; but if I do it without any fault or criminal choice of my own, a di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel is committed unto me.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign">
derived from <GAP DESC="foreign">, and of the &s;ame &s;ignification, is in the New Te&s;tament u&s;ed in Philem. 14, only;
<Q>That thy benefit &s;hould not be of nece&s;&s;ity, but <HI>willingly:</HI></Q>
which I pre&s;ume even Dr. C. would not expound thus;
<PB N="189" REF="022478_0194_0FB93337F5B874E8">
That thy benefit &s;hould not be of nece&s;&s;ity, but through &s;ome fault of thine own.&mdash;The adverb, <GAP DESC="foreign">, is u&s;ed twice in the New Te&s;tament, Heb. X. 26;
<Q>If we &s;in <HI>willfully,</HI> after we have received the knowledge of the truth:</Q>
and 1 Pet. V. 2,
<Q>Taking the over&s;ight thereof, not by con&s;traint but <HI>willingly.</HI></Q>
To the fir&s;t of the&s;e the Doctor in a quotation from <HI>Taylor,</HI> refers, as an authority, to confirm his &s;en&s;e of <HI>willingly</HI> in Rom. VIII. But &s;urely both he and Taylor made this reference with little con&s;ideration; for according to them the &s;en&s;e of the ver&s;e in Hebrews is this; If after we have received the knowledge of the truth, we &s;in
<Q>through our own fault,</Q>
or "by our own criminal choice." Did Dr. C. or Dr. T. indeed believe, that we ever &s;in without any fault of our own, or without our own criminal choice? &mdash;It is plain, that the meaning of Heb. X. 26, is what is well expre&s;&s;ed in the tran&s;lation; If we &s;in <HI>wilfully,</HI> not through &s;ome inattention, but pertinaciou&s;ly, after we know the truth, know our duty and the proper motives to it; there remaineth no more &s;acrifice for &s;in.</P>
<P>THUS the con&s;truction, which Dr. C. gives of <HI>willingly,</HI> as meaning, "through our own fault," or
<Q>by our own criminal choice,</Q>
appears to be wholly un&s;upported by any authority; to be a mere invention to help over the dif|ficulty of the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the in&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;hould advance &s;o trifling a propo&s;ition as this; that mankind do not choo&s;e mi&s;ery: and al&s;o appears to be attended with many ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>THE error of that con&s;truction further appears from this, that if what comes upon us not through our own fault, be properly expre&s;&s;ed by &s;aying, that we are &s;ubjected to it, <HI>not willingly</HI>; then what does come upon us through our own fault, may be properly expre&s;&s;ed, by &s;aying, it comes upon us <HI>willingly.</HI> At this rate the inhabitants of the old world were drowned <HI>willingly</HI>: Sodom and Gomorrah were burnt up <HI>willingly</HI>: Pharaoh was fir&s;t plagued, and then de&s;troyed in the Red Sea <HI>willingly</HI>: Korah, Dathan and Abiram were &s;wallowed up in the earth <HI>willingly</HI>: Tho&s;e whom Dr. C &s;uppo&s;es to be puni&s;hed in hell for ages of ages, are puni&s;hed <HI>willingly.</HI></P>
<P>NEITHER is it true, in Dr. C's &s;en&s;e, that mankind are made &s;ubject to vanity, <HI>not willingly</HI>: i. e.

&mdash;By <HI>vanity</HI> he under&s;tands "mortality," "and the infelicities of this vain mortal life," There|fore according to him, men are not made &s;ubject to morta|lity, and the infelicities of this life, through any fault of their own. And if &s;o, then death and the various infeli|cities of life are not any evidence, that the &s;ubjects of death and tho&s;e infelicities are them&s;elves &s;inners, or the objects of God's di&s;plea&s;ure. But this is contrary to the whole current of &s;criptural repre&s;entations; particularly to P&s;. XC. 3, &amp;c.
<Q>Thou turne&s;t man to de&s;truction, and &s;aye&s;t, Return ye children of men.&mdash;Thou carrie&s;t them away, as with a flood; they are as a &s;leep. In the morning they are like gra&s;s, which groweth up; in the evening it is cut down and withereth. For they are con&s;umed <HI>by thine anger,</HI> and by thy <HI>wrath</HI> they are troubled.

<Q>How plain and full is this te&s;timony, that the general morta|lity of mankind is an evidence of God's <HI>anger for the &s;in</HI> of tho&s;e, who are the &s;ubjects of &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ati|on?</Q>

<P>BUT if mortality and the calamities of life be an evi|dence of God's anger at the &s;in of tho&s;e, who &s;uffer death and tho&s;e calamities; then it is not true, that men in ge|neral are &s;ubjected to death and tho&s;e calamities, without any fault of their own; but the truth is, that they are &s;ubjected to them on account of their own &s;in, as this is the very cau&s;e of the divine anger, of which calamity and death are the effects and tokens.</P>

<P N="5">V. WE at length come to con&s;ider Dr. C's &s;en&s;e of the phra&s;e <HI>bondage of corruption.</HI>&mdash;This according to him is

Dr. C. &s;ays, that in con&s;equence of the &s;ubjection of man
<Q>to a frail, mortal, corruptible condition&mdash;he is upon the foot of <HI>mere law,</HI> and without the &s;uppo&s;ition of <HI>grace</HI> or <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> in bondage to bodily or animal appetites and inclinations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 109.</NOTE></Q>
It &s;eems then, that &s;ince all chri&s;tiani|zed nations are under not <HI>mere law,</HI> but <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> they are not in bondage to bodily or animal appetites and inclinations, and doubtle&s;s for the &s;ame rea&s;on, are not in bondage to any principle of depravity. But is this indeed &s;o, that men under <HI>mere law</HI> are &s;o depraved, as to be in bondage to animal appetites; but as &s;oon as they are placed under the go&s;pel, in the mere external di&s;pen&s;ation of it, they are no longer the &s;ubjects of any depravity? It &s;eems then, that the natural depravity of men depends on their mere external circum&s;tances; that while they are without the go&s;pel their hearts are in bondage to animal appetites: but as &s;oon as they are placed under the go&s;pel, however they di&s;regard it, they are free from that bon|dage. But all tho&s;e nations, to whom Chri&s;tianity is pub|li&s;hed, are under the go&s;pel; therefore they are already free from bondage to animal appetites; and it is ab&s;urd for them to <HI>hope,</HI> that they <HI>&s;hall</HI> be delivered from this part of the bondage of corruption.</P>
<P>BESIDE; Dr. C. &s;ays, that
<Q>both the&s;e &s;en&s;es of bondage</Q>
[i. e. bondage to death and bondage to ani|mal apetites]
<Q>are certainly included in that vanity the creature is &s;ubjected to.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> Then by the creature Dr. C. mu&s;t mean, not the whole moral creation, or all man|kind including tho&s;e nations and individuals to whom the go&s;pel is made known: becau&s;e they are not under <HI>mere law,</HI> and therefore according to him are not &s;ubjected to that part of vanity which con&s;i&s;ts in bondage to animal ap|petites.

<P>ACCORDING to Dr. C. vanity includes bondage to bo|dily or animal appetites. Yet mankind are &s;ubjected to vanity not through any fault or crime of their own. But
<PB N="193" REF="022478_0198_0FB9334076B591C8">
is it not a fault or crime in any man, to be governed by his bodily appetites, or to be in bondage to them? With what truth or con&s;i&s;tency then could he hold, that men are &s;ubjected to vanity not through any fault or crime of their own, and that therefore their &s;ubjection to vanity is a ground of hope of deliverance from it; when the very &s;tate of &s;ubjection to vanity is a very great fault or crime? Can a fault or crime be a ground of hope of impunity, or of the divine favour?</P>
<P>BUT perhaps it may be pleaded, that though the <HI>&s;tate</HI> of &s;ubjection, or the being &s;ubject to vanity, implies a fault; yet the <HI>act of &s;ubjecting,</HI> or the act by which man|kind were &s;ubjected, to vanity, is not through, or on ac|count of any previous fault of mankind in general; and this is the ground of hope that they &s;hall be delivered. If this be the meaning of Dr. C. it comes to this. That becau&s;e mankind are, in con&s;equence of Adam's &s;in, not their own per&s;onal &s;in, &s;ubjected by God to frailty, mor|tality, bodily appetites and &s;in; therefore they do not de|&s;erve to be left without hope of deliverance: the divine perfections do not admit of it: it would not be ju&s;t: at lea&s;t it would be a hard ca&s;e. Otherwi&s;e where is the ground of hope of deliverance? No promi&s;e is pleaded as the ground of this hope. The only pretended ground of hope in this argument is, that mankind were &s;ubjected to vanity, not through any fault of their own: as in the following pa&s;&s;age;
<Q>For if mankind were &s;ubjected to a &s;tate of &s;uffering, not through any wilful di&s;obedience which they them&s;elves had been per&s;onally guilty of, it is congruous to rea&s;on to think, that they &s;hould be &s;ub|jected to it not finally&mdash;but with room for hope that they &s;hould be delivered from it: and was it not for this hope, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed&mdash;it would be a reflection on the&mdash;benevolence of the Deity to &s;uppo&s;e, that they would have been &s;ubjected to it.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 102.</NOTE> But if this &s;ubjection to vanity by God be perfectly ju&s;t, what right have we to expect, that God will deliver <HI>all</HI> men from the con&s;e|quences of it?

And would it be a reflection on the Deity, not to expect this?</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="022478_0199_0FB92ECDABCE9980">SO that this whole argument of Dr. C. implies that God in &s;ubjecting mankind, on account of Adam's &s;in, "to a &s;tate of &s;uffering," made an unju&s;t con&s;titution. Yet Dr. C. him&s;elf abundantly holds, that this is a real con&s;titution of God.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, it is implied in all this, that if man|kind had been thus &s;ubjected to vanity, in con&s;equence of their own per&s;onal &s;in; they might ju&s;tly have been left with|out hope. Thus it is really granted by Dr. C. after all his labour to prove the contrary, that the per&s;onal &s;ins of men, de&s;erve a hopele&s;s &s;tate of &s;uffering. And the whole que&s;tion in the pre&s;ent view of it, comes to this, Whether the per&s;onal actual &s;ins of mankind, under the pre&s;ent di|vine con&s;titution, be real &s;ins, and de&s;erve the puni&s;hment ju&s;tly due to &s;in: or whether the&s;e &s;ins be not excu&s;able, becau&s;e they are the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;equence of Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and not the con&s;equence of their own volun|tary act. Or in other words, whether the moral evil of any action con&s;i&s;t in the nature of the action it&s;elf, or in its cau&s;e or antecedents. Of this que&s;tion I &s;hould be very willing to enter into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, were it nece&s;&s;ary: but as it has been &s;o particularly con&s;idered by another author, I beg leave to refer to him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;ident <HI>Edwards's</HI> Enquiry into Freedom of Will throughout; particularly Part IV. Sect. I.</NOTE> I beg the reader's patience however, while I make only one or two brief ob&s;erva|tions.</P>
<P>IF the pre&s;ent actions of mankind be excu&s;able, becau&s;e they are the con&s;equence of Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and not of their own previous &s;inful actions or volitions, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance; it will follow that there is no &s;in or moral evil in the world, nor ever has been. All the pre&s;ent ac|tions of men, if they be excu&s;able, are no moral evil. The &s;ame is true of all the actions of men ever &s;ince the fall of Adam. And even Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion it&s;elf is no moral evil; for this did not take place in con&s;equence of any previous criminal choice or action; becau&s;e by &s;uppo|&s;ition, that tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion was the fir&s;t &s;in committed by man. Whatever tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion he fir&s;t committed, is the very tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of which we are &s;peaking: and it is ab&s;urd to talk of a &s;in previous to the fir&s;t &s;in.</P>
<P>CONCERNING Dr. C's idea, that mankind are &s;ubjected to mortality, infirmity, and the influence of bodily appe|tites,
<PB N="195" REF="022478_0200_0FB92ED0AF039948">
on account of Adam's &s;in only, without any regard to their per&s;onal &s;ins; and that this &s;ubjection was the cau&s;e and occa&s;ion of all the actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and tem|poral calamities of the po&s;terity of Adam; it may be ob|&s;erved;</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT for rea&s;ons already given,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 190.</NOTE> it appears not to be true, that mortality and the calamities of life are brought on men on account of Adam's &s;in merely, without regard to the per&s;onal demerit of tho&s;e who &s;uffer them.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT the human race was indeed, in the &s;entence of God on Adam, &s;ubjected to infirmity and mortality: but it was no more &s;ubjected to the&s;e, than it was to de|pravity and &s;in. At lea&s;t to a&s;&s;ert the contrary would be to beg an important point in di&s;pute: and to be &s;ure, Dr. C. could not with any con&s;i&s;tency a&s;&s;ert the contrary. He holds throughout this, and all his other works, that the human race is &s;ubjected to infirmity on account of Adam's &s;in, and the Doctor's idea of this infirmity amounts to a proper moral depravity of nature. All that is meant, or that needs to be meant, by the moral depravity natural to mankind, in this fallen &s;tate, &s;o far as that depravity is di&s;|tinct from <HI>actual</HI> &s;in, is &s;omething in our nature, which uni|ver&s;ally leads to actual &s;in. Whether this &s;omething ex|i&s;t primarily in the body and bodily appetites, or primarily in the &s;oul, is perfectly immaterial, &s;o long as it is an un|failing &s;ource of actual &s;in, as Dr. C. manife&s;tly con&s;iders it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 45, &amp;c.</NOTE> In his <HI>Five Di&s;&s;ertations</HI> he is very explicit and abun|dant in this matter.

<Q>And &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, <HI>for that</HI></Q>
(or as he will have it, <HI>whereupon, in con&s;equence of which</HI>) "all have &s;inned;"
<PB N="196" REF="022478_0201_0FB92ED22A958128">
comes to this only; that on account of Adam's &s;in, a di|vine &s;entence was denounced on the whole human race, dooming it to a &s;tate of moral depravity; in con&s;equence of which moral depravity all men commit actual &s;in. What then has the Doctor gained by the con&s;truction of this pa&s;&s;age, which he has laboured &s;o hardly in this and his other works to e&s;tabli&s;h; and in which he claims to be an original; and which perhaps is the only particular in his whole book, with re&s;pect to which he has a right to &s;et up this claim? It is al&s;o curious to &s;ee a gentleman of Dr. C's abilities, both oppo&s;ing and defending with all his might, the native moral depravity of human nature!</P>
<P>REASONS have been already given, why <HI>willingly</HI> ought to be under&s;tood not to mean <HI>through the fault of a per&s;on</HI>; but in its original proper &s;en&s;e, <HI>with the con&s;ent of a per&s;on.</HI> If tho&s;e rea&s;ons be &s;ufficient, there is a further difficulty in Dr. C's con&s;truction of this pa&s;&s;age, e&s;pecially of the 20th ver&s;e. According to his con&s;truction of <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>crea|ture,</HI> the apo&s;tle declares, that mankind are &s;ubject to their bodily appetites, and &s;o to &s;in, not willingly, not with their own con&s;ent. But is it po&s;&s;ible, that men &s;hould be &s;ub|ject to bodily appetites, and &s;hould commit actual, per&s;on|al &s;in, without their own con&s;ent?&mdash;If, to evade this ob&s;ervation, it be &s;aid, that they are however by the act of God, without any previous con&s;ent of their own, &s;ubject|ed to frailty, mortality, bodily appetites, and &s;o to &s;in; this would be mere trifling. Who ever imagined, that God fir&s;t waited for the con&s;ent of mankind, and having obtained their con&s;ent, e&s;tabli&s;hed the con&s;titution, by which they became mortal, frail, &s;ubject to the influence of their bodily appetites and &s;o to &s;in?</P>
<P>AFTER all, Dr. C's expo&s;ition of this paragraph in Rom. VIII, is by no means, even on his own principles, a proof of univer&s;al &s;alvation. His tran&s;lation of tho&s;e mo&s;t im|portant words in the 20th and 21&s;t ver&s;es, is this,
<Q>The creature was &s;ubjected to vanity, not willingly; but by the judicial &s;entence of him, who &s;ubjected it, <HI>in con&s;e|quence of a previous hope,</HI> that even this very creature &s;hould be delivered from its &s;lavery of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</Q>
So that the utmo&s;t, which this pa&s;&s;age teaches, according to his own account, is, that mankind may now <HI>hope,</HI> that they &s;hall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the
<PB N="197" REF="022478_0202_0FB92ED5A4F0E8C0">
glorious liberty of the children of God. But what if there be a foundation to <HI>hope</HI> that this will be the ca&s;e? Does it thence follow, that this hope will certainly be fulfilled? In con&s;equence of the death of Chri&s;t and the proclamation of the go&s;pel, there is a door of hope &s;et open to all men. But does it hence follow, that all men will certainly enter in at this door, and &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings for which there is a foundation to hope? D. C. would doubtle&s;s grant, that there is a door of <HI>hope</HI> opened to mankind in general, that they may be &s;aved immediately after death. Yet he would not pretend, that this hope is realized. God delivered the I&s;raelites out of Egypt in &s;uch a manner, as gave <HI>hope</HI> that even that generation would enter the promi&s;ed land. Yet this hope was not fulfilled.&mdash;Therefore, though it &s;hould be granted, that God hath &s;ubjected mankind to vanity <HI>in hope,</HI> that they &s;hall be delivered from it, into the glorious liberty of the children of God, it would by no means follow, that all men will be &s;aved: and Dr. C. is entirely mi&s;taken, when he &s;ays,
<Q>Mankind univer&s;al|ly is expre&s;&s;ly made, in the 21&s;t ver&s;e, the &s;ubject of this glorious immortality.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 102.</NOTE> No &s;uch thing is expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid, and in the&s;e words he contradicts his own paraphra&s;e of that ver&s;e, in which he pretends no more, than that there is a foundation for <HI>hope,</HI> that mankind &s;hall attain to a glorious immortality.</P>
<P>IN the preceding remarks on Dr. C's con&s;truction of this pa&s;&s;age, the &s;en&s;e, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be the true one, hath been &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed. Yet it may be proper here briefly to repeat it.&mdash;The earne&s;t expectation of the creation waiteth for the manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God. For the creation is &s;ubject to that u&s;e to which it is applied by &s;inful men, which, as to the end of its exi&s;tence, the divine glory, is in its own natural tendency, vain and unprofitable, and in many re&s;pects po&s;itively &s;inful; I &s;ay, to this it is &s;ubject not voluntarily, but on account of him, for the &s;ake of his glory, (<GAP DESC="foreign">
governing the accu&s;ative) or for the accompli&s;hment of the my&s;terious, but wi&s;e and glorious purpo&s;es of him, who &s;ubjected the &s;ame in hope, that this &s;ame creation &s;hall be delivered from this unpro|fitable and &s;inful u&s;e, which may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as a &s;tate of bondage to it, into a liberty, in &s;everal important re&s;pects, &s;imilar to that of the children of God; or at

lea&s;t &s;hall be delivered at the time, when the children of God &s;hall be admitted to the enjoyment of their mo&s;t glori|ous liberty. For we know, that the whole creation groan|eth and travaileth in pain together until now, by rea&s;on of that vile abu&s;e and perver&s;ion, which is made of it by &s;in|ful men, and through de&s;ire of that deliverance ju&s;t menti|oned, and in due time to be granted it.</P>
<P>BESIDE the ob&s;ervations on particular parts of Dr. C's con&s;truction of Rom. VIII. &s;ome more general remarks occur.&mdash;One is, that his con&s;truction implies, that the divine law is unju&s;t, and cannot be executed con&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice. He &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 109.</NOTE> that man on the foot of <HI>mere law,</HI> without grace, is in bondage to bodily appetites: there|fore on the foot of mere law, without grace, there is no hope for him. And he &s;peaks<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 122.</NOTE> of the ca&s;e of mankind as remedile&s;s, without the grace manife&s;ted in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Yet in the &s;ame page he &s;ays,
<Q>It is the thought, that mankind were &s;ubjected to &s;uffering, not remedile&s;&s;ly, but with an intention of mercy,</Q>
and
<Q>it is this thought only, that can reconcile the unavoidable &s;ufferings of the race of men, as occa&s;ioned by the lap&s;e of Adam, with the perfections of God.</Q>
So that God made a law, which could not be executed, con&s;i&s;tently with his perfections, and he was obligated in ju&s;tice to &s;hew mercy through Chri&s;t, to mankind. By mere law men were re|medile&s;s, and if they had been &s;uffered to remain in that remedile&s;s &s;tate, as they would have remained in it with|out Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel, &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ation could not have been reconciled with the perfections of God. There|fore the divine law cannot be reconciled with ju&s;tice, or with the perfections of God.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to Dr. C. vanity included in it <HI>bondage</HI> to bodily appetites, as well as <HI>bondage</HI> to death.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 109.</NOTE> There|fore, as God could not con&s;i&s;tently with his perfections, &s;ubject mankind to vanity, without an intention of mercy;<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 122.</NOTE> and as it would be a reflection on the Deity, to &s;uppo&s;e, that he has &s;ubjected mankind to vanity, without hope of deliverance:<NOTE N="&Verbar;&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 103.</NOTE> therefore on the&s;e principles, God could not con&s;i&s;tently with his perfections and character, avoid giving mankind a ground of hope of deliverance from &s;in, or he could not withhold the grace of the go&s;pel: but he was obliged in ju&s;tice to his own character, to deliver men

from both &s;in and the &s;ufferings of this life, and it may be pre&s;umed, that Dr. C. would have con&s;ented to add, and from the &s;ufferings of hell too. Where then is the grace of the go&s;pel, and of the gift of Chri&s;t? In the gift of Chri&s;t, in the in&s;titution of the go&s;pel, and in every thing pertaining to it, &s;o far as was nece&s;&s;ary to our deliverance from &s;in and puni&s;hment, God has done no more than was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ave his own character from reflections and re|proach.</P>
<P>IT may be further remarked, that Dr. C.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 103.</NOTE> argues, that becau&s;e men are &s;ubjected to a &s;tate of &s;uffering, not through their own per&s;onal di&s;obedience;
<Q>it is congru|ous to rea&s;on to think, that they &s;hould be &s;ubjected to it, not <HI>finally.</HI></Q>
But why does he &s;ay, "not finally"? He might with the &s;ame &s;trength of argument have &s;aid, <HI>not at all.</HI> The calamities of this life, with temporal death, are inflicted on mankind, either as a puni&s;hment, or as &s;overeign and wi&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence. If they be inflicted as a puni&s;hment, without any &s;in, by which the &s;ubjects de&s;erve them, they are as real an injury as endle&s;s mi&s;ery would be, if it were inflicted as a puni&s;hment, in like manner without any &s;in, by which it &s;hould be de|&s;erved. And if God do indeed injure his creatures in a le&s;s degree, he is an injurious being: and what &s;ecurity have we concerning &s;uch a being, that he will not injure them in the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree?&mdash;So that if God be a ju&s;t being, as it is agreed on all hands, that he is, it is equal|ly "congruous to rea&s;on to think," that he would not &s;ubject his creatures to a temporary &s;tate of &s;uffering, as a puni&s;hment, without any &s;in, by which they de&s;erved it, as that he would not &s;ubject them to a &s;tate of final &s;uffer|ing.</P>
<P>IF it be &s;aid, that death and the calamities of life are not a puni&s;hment of mankind, but mere &s;overeign, wi&s;e di&s;|pen&s;ations of providence; this &s;uppo&s;ition opens a door for endle&s;s mi&s;ery. For how do we know, that the &s;ame &s;o|vereign wi&s;dom, which is now &s;uppo&s;ed to inflict tempo|ral evils on mankind, may not al&s;o &s;ee fit to inflict on them endle&s;s evils?</P>
<P>ACCORDING to Dr. C. men are by a divine con&s;titution &s;ubjected to vanity including mortality, infelicity and bond|age to bodily appetites. But why was this con&s;titution
<PB N="200" REF="022478_0205_0FB92EDE3341FE78">
made? Was it made for the greater happine&s;s of every individual, or of the &s;y&s;tem, or of both? Which ever of the&s;e an&s;wers be given, it will follow, that evil, both na|tural and moral is &s;ub&s;ervient to good; and is introduced, if not in the fir&s;t in&s;tance of Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, yet in every other in&s;tance, by the po&s;itive de&s;ign and con&s;titu|tion of God. Evil therefore both natural and moral, makes a part of the &s;cheme of God, takes place by his con&s;titution, and is &s;ubject to his controul? What then becomes of the &s;cheme of &s;elf-determining power, for which Dr. C. is &s;o zealous an advocate? And here how ju&s;tly may many pa&s;&s;ages in Dr. C's writings be retorted? Particularly the following;
<Q>If men's volitions and their con&s;equent effects, are the re&s;ult of invariable ne|ce&s;&s;ity in virtue of &s;ome <HI>exterior cau&s;es</HI> &s;o inviolably connected, as that they will and mu&s;t come to pa&s;s, the author of this connection, which according to this plan is God, is the only efficient and real author of whatever has been, or &s;hall hereafter be brought into event; not excluding any of the mo&s;t complicated vil|lanies that have been, or may be perpetrated by any of the &s;ons of Adam. Is this a &s;cheme of thoughts fit to be embraced by intelligent creatures?</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Benevolence of the Deity, P. 136.</NOTE></P>
<P>BESIDE, if this con&s;titution were made for the greater happine&s;s of every individual, then every individual is more happy than he would have been, if he had not been &s;ub|jected to vanity; and then there is no &s;uch thing as puni&s;h|ment in the &s;ubjection to vanity, or in any of its con&s;e|quences; nor any foundation, with a view to the private intere&s;t of any man, to regret any of the evils of this life, or of that which is to come.</P>
<P>IT does not however appear to be fact, that every in|dividual is in this life rendered more happy, by the evils which he &s;uffers here: and to &s;ay that he will be render|ed by them more happy on the whole hereafter, neither ap|pears to be fact, nor to be capable of proof. How will a|ny man prove, that the Sodomites will on the whole be more happy, than Enoch and Elijah, who never ta&s;ted death?</P>
<P>IF all men be &s;ubjected to vanity, to promote not their per&s;onal good, but the good of the &s;y&s;tem, and the good of individuals be given up to this end; why may we not
<PB N="201" REF="022478_0206_0FB92EE3A865FEC8">
in the &s;ame way account for endle&s;s puni&s;hment?&mdash;If it be not con&s;i&s;tent with the divine perfections to &s;ubject men to &s;uffering, unle&s;s it i&s;&s;ue in their per&s;onal good; then it is not con&s;i&s;tent with the divine perfections to puni&s;h at all, either in this world, or the future.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Containing remarks on Dr. C's arguments from Col. I. <HI>19, 20.</HI> Eph. I. <HI>10.</HI> and <HI>1</HI> Tim. II. <HI>4.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t of tho&s;e texts is:
<Q>For it plea&s;ed the Fa|ther, that in him all fullne&s;s &s;hould dwell. And having made peace by the blood of the cro&s;s, by him to reconcile all things unto him&s;elf: by him, I &s;ay, whe|ther they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</Q>
&mdash;Dr. C's &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age is this:
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 127.</NOTE>It plea&s;ed the Father&mdash;by Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;to change back all things to him&s;elf&mdash;to change the &s;tate of this lower world, of the men and of the things, whether they be on earth, or in the aerial heaven, that encompa&s;&s;es it.</Q>
It was his opinion, that to reconcile all the&s;e things, is to rechange their &s;tate, or bring them back to that &s;tate they were ori|ginally in.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 129.</NOTE> With reference to mankind, he &s;ays,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 132.</NOTE>
<Q>By Chri&s;t their &s;tate was changed back, they were ab&s;olute|ly brought back to the condition they would have been in, had it not been for the lap&s;e; what I mean is, that they were ab&s;olutely and unconditionally put into &s;alva|ble circum&s;tances.</Q>
&mdash;But what follows from all this; One would think Dr. C. had forgotten him&s;elf. Suppo|&s;ing all this were granted, would it follow, that all men will be &s;aved? That becau&s;e they are in &s;alvable circum|&s;tances, therefore their actual &s;alvation will be effected? No, no more than from the original &s;tate of Adam, it followed that he would never fall. He was indued with a power to &s;tand: he was in &s;uch circum&s;tances, that he might have continued in his original innocence. Yet he fell. So, though it be granted, that all men are by Chri&s;t put into &s;alvable circum&s;tances, yet through their ob&s;tinate impeni|tence and unbelief they may fail of this great &s;alvation.&mdash;
<PB N="202" REF="022478_0207_0FB92EE5EF3B4F00">
Doubtle&s;s Dr. C. believed, that by Chri&s;t the &s;tate of man|kind is &s;o changed, that they are all &s;alvable, or may be &s;aved, immediately after the end of this world. But this notwith&s;tanding, he believed al&s;o, that a great part of mankind would die impenitent, and that none of <HI>them</HI> would be &s;aved within a thou&s;and years of the end of this world, and &s;ome of them not till after ages of ages.</P>
<P>BUT in aid of his argument from this pa&s;&s;age, the Doctor brings in again, Rom. V. 10.
<Q>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his &s;on; <HI>much more</HI> being reconciled, we &s;hall be &s;aved, by his life.</Q>
I have formerly remarked on the Doctor's u&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age; and need not repeat tho&s;e remarks. It may be ob&s;erved, however, that the manner of his ap|plying this pa&s;&s;age to &s;trengthen his argument from Col. I. 20, really implies, that this la&s;t text taken by it&s;elf, con|tains no argument at all, and therefore ought never to have been introduced as a proof. Whatever force there is in it, to prove univer&s;al &s;alvation, depends entirely, ac|cording to Dr. C's &s;tating of the matter, on Rom. V. 10, which has been con&s;idered already.&mdash;So that if his &s;en&s;e of Col. I. 20, be true, it does nothing towards proving the &s;alvation of all men.</P>
<P>I DO not however mean to &s;ugge&s;t, that Dr. C's &s;en&s;e is, in my opinion, the true one. It is impo&s;&s;ible, that all things &s;hould be brought back, in all re&s;pects, to their ori|ginal &s;tate. All mankind cannot now live in the garden of Eden. It cannot be again fact, that all the knowledge of God po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by men, &s;hould be &s;uch as is derived from either the works of creation and providence, or from im|mediate intercour&s;e of God and angels with men. Nor can it be ever again true, that God is propitious to men immediately, without a mediator. In the&s;e, and perhaps many other re&s;pects, mankind cannot be changed back to their original &s;tate. But if once the advocates for univer|&s;al &s;alvation admit of limitations, and &s;ay, that all things will however be brought to their original &s;tate in many re|&s;pects, the believers in endle&s;s puni&s;hment too mu&s;t be al|lowed to apply their limitations; and they will allow, that as the original &s;tate was a &s;tate of order, regularity and due &s;ubordination, wherein every per&s;on and thing were in their proper places; &s;o in this &s;en&s;e all things will final|ly
<PB N="203" REF="022478_0208_0FB92EE7423746A8">
be brought back to their original &s;tate, and order will be again re&s;tored to the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>NOR does the verb <GAP DESC="foreign">
&s;ignify in general to change any thing back to its former &s;tate. For in&s;tance, if two men had been long and habitual enemies to each other; and if having for a while become friends, they &s;hould re|turn to their former enmity; I believe no critic in the Greek language would think this return to their enmity, would be properly expre&s;&s;ed by <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>reconcile.</HI> When the Jews were brought home from the Babyloni&s;h captivity, they were changed back to their former &s;tate. But is this change ever expre&s;&s;ed by <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>reconcile</HI>?</P>
<P>THIS verb is never u&s;ed in the New Te&s;tament, but to &s;ignify a change, whereby tho&s;e who were at enmity, be|come friends. This ob&s;ervation is true of all tho&s;e words of the &s;ame derivation, on which Dr, C. critici&s;es &s;o a|bundantly from page 128, to 142. It is therefore not ap|plicable to <HI>all</HI> the things on this earth, and in the aerial hea|ven, unle&s;s it be by the figure <HI>pro&s;opopoeia.</HI> By that figure indeed every thing animate and inanimate may be &s;aid to be alienated from man, in con&s;equence of his &s;in; and to be reconciled to him in con&s;equence of the blood of the cro&s;s, and of the return of man to God through Chri&s;t. But if this were the idea of Dr. C. he &s;hould have given up his objection to the &s;en&s;e of Rom. VIII. 19, &amp;c, gi|ven by the believers in endle&s;s puni&s;hment; and at the &s;ame time he would have virtually given up his own &s;en&s;e of that pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>IT is &s;trange, that Dr. C. as well as the tran&s;lators of the bible, &s;hould render the words <GAP DESC="foreign">
in Col. I. 20, <HI>unto him&s;elf.</HI> In the preceding ver&s;e we have <GAP DESC="foreign">; in the 20th ver&s;e we have <GAP DESC="foreign">, and again, <GAP DESC="foreign">. Now it &s;eems very odd, that in this multiplied u&s;e of <GAP DESC="foreign">
in its various ca&s;es, one in&s;tance only &s;hould be &s;elected from the re&s;t, and rendered <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> meaning the Father, and in all the other in&s;tances it &s;hould be referred to Chri&s;t. No per&s;on without prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, con&s;truing this pa&s;&s;age, would render it in that manner. It is altogether unnatural to &s;uppo&s;e, but that <GAP DESC="foreign">
refers to the &s;ame per|&s;on in all the&s;e in&s;tances, and ought to be rendered accord|ingly.</P>
<P>IT is further to be ob&s;erved concerning <GAP DESC="foreign">
and <GAP DESC="foreign">, that in all in&s;tances in which they occur in
<PB N="204" REF="022478_0209_0FB92EE8AAAE1620">
the New Te&s;tament, in the Septuagint and in the Apo|crypha, the per&s;on to whom the &s;ubject of the propo&s;ition is &s;aid to be reconciled, is never once expre&s;&s;ed in the ac|cu&s;ative ca&s;e governed by the prepo&s;ition <GAP DESC="foreign">; but is always expre&s;&s;ed in the dative ca&s;e. Hence it may be inferred that <GAP DESC="foreign">
in Col. I. 20, does not mean the per&s;on to whom all things in heaven and earth are reconciled: but that it means, that all things in heaven and earth are re|conciled to each other, into him: i. e. &s;o as to be brought into Chri&s;t, to be united under him as their head, and be intere&s;ted in the common advantages and ble&s;&s;ings of his glorious kingdom.</P>
<P>TO <HI>be in Chri&s;t</HI> is a common phra&s;e of the New Te&s;ta|ment to expre&s;s &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t, and an intere&s;t in the ble&s;&s;ings of his kingdom; and <HI>to be reconciled into Chri&s;t,</HI> may mean to become united to him by faith, to become &s;ubject to him in obedience, and to be intere&s;ted in all the ble&s;&s;ings of his kingdom.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whether this critici&s;m on the words <GAP DESC="foreign">, be ju&s;t or not, it affects not the main que&s;tion of the &s;alvation of all men.</NOTE></P>
<P>BY &s;in angels and men, Jews and Gentiles, became alienated from each other; and men in general, by the pre|dominancy of &s;elf-love, became virtually enemies to each other. Now it plea&s;ed the Father to reconcile by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, angels and men, Jews and Gentiles to each other, and to diffu&s;e by his grace a &s;pirit of benevolence among them, whereby they &s;hould love their neighbour as them|&s;elves. And as to the univer&s;al term <HI>all things,</HI> we cannot take it in its literal and utmo&s;t extent, unle&s;s by the figure before mentioned, which Dr. C. cannot admit, without giving up what he mo&s;t earne&s;tly contends for, in his com|ment on Rom. VIII. 19, &amp;c. But if we once admit a limitation of that univer&s;al term, every one mu&s;t be al|lowed to propo&s;e his own limitation, and &s;ome doubtle&s;s will in&s;i&s;t, that it extends to angels and to believers only from among men: as it is &s;aid, that <HI>all</HI> Judea, and <HI>all</HI> the region round about Jordan, were batized by John: <HI>all</HI> men counted John that he was a prophet: <HI>all</HI> men came to Chri&s;t, John III. 26.</P>
<P>BUT if we &s;hould allow, that <HI>all</HI> things in heaven and earth include all mankind; &s;till even in this extent it is
<PB N="205" REF="022478_0210_0FB92EEE62D21BB8">
true, that it plea&s;ed the Father to reconcile all things; but in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, as not to imply the &s;alvation of all men. This is true in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, in which God hath no plea|&s;ure in the death of the wicked, Ezek. XXXIII. 11; or in the death of him that dieth, Chap. XVIII. 32; in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in which God was unwilling to give up Eph|raim, Ho&s;. XI. 8; and in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in which Chri&s;t was unwilling to give up the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem, and would have gathered them together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings; though they would not.&mdash; The de&s;truction of the &s;inner is not in it&s;elf agreeable to God; as the puni&s;hment of a child is not in it&s;elf agreeable to a good parent. Yet as a good parent may, to &s;ecure the general good of his family, puni&s;h a di&s;obedient child; &s;o God, to &s;ecure the general good of his kingdom, may puni&s;h a rebellious creature. As the good parent who, to prevent that puni&s;hment to which his di&s;obedient and apo&s;tate child mu&s;t, going on in his di&s;obedience, be &s;ub|jected, u&s;es all proper means to reclaim him; may be &s;aid to be plea&s;ed with the idea of his impunity; &s;o the Deity who u&s;es all proper means to reclaim all mankind, and to reconcile them to one another, may be &s;aid to be well plea|&s;ed with the idea of this reconciliation, or to choo&s;e to re|concile all men to one another, and to bring them into Chri&s;t. In it&s;elf it is the object of his choice and com|placency.&mdash;In this &s;en&s;e it plea&s;ed the Father to recon|cile all things: it was what plea&s;ed him.</P>
<P>ON the whole it appears, that if Dr. C's &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age be the true one, it affords no proof at all of uni|ver&s;al &s;alvation;&mdash;That his con&s;truction of it is far le&s;s favourable to that doctrine, than that which &s;eems to be holden forth by our tran&s;lation;&mdash;That if this la&s;t con|&s;truction be adopted, &s;till it would be no real proof of uni|ver&s;al &s;alvation, for two rea&s;ons; (1) That the univer&s;al term mu&s;t be limited, and therefore may be &s;o limited as to comprehend angels and believers only of all nations. (2) That even if the univer&s;al term be extended to all mankind, &s;till the text is capable of a con&s;truction both rational and an|alogous to other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, which yet does by no means imply univer&s;al &s;alvation. And the &s;equel of the apo&s;|le's di&s;cour&s;e favours this la&s;t con&s;truction, implying, that it plea&s;ed the father, or was in it&s;elf plea&s;ing to the father, to reconcile all men, <HI>on the terms of the go&s;pel,</HI> and not <HI>ab&s;olute|ly,</HI>
<PB N="206" REF="022478_0211_0FB92EF0EFE5F298">
as Dr. C. &s;uppo&s;es. The &s;equel is,
<Q>And you that were &s;ometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled&mdash;to pre&s;ent you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his &s;ight: if ye continue in the faith grounded and &s;ettled, and be not moved away from the hope of the go&s;pel.</Q>
&mdash;Will a|ny man pretend, but that this implies, that if they did not continue in the faith, they would not be pre&s;ented unblam|able in the &s;ight of God?&mdash;But this is far from the doc|trine which teaches, that all mankind, whether believers or unbelievers, whether they continue in the faith or not, &s;hall be &s;aved.</P>
<P>BEFORE I quit this part of the Doctor's book, I &s;hall add one remark more. In his comment on this, Col. I. 20, and on Rom, V. 10, he takes great pains to make out a dou|ble reconciliation to be taught by the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul.</HI>
<Q>The one, he &s;ays, means that change of &s;tate all men are ab&s;olutely brought into by the death of Chri&s;t; and is oppo&s;ed to the condemnation through the lap&s;e of the one man Adam. The other is that change of &s;tate, which is connected with an actual meetne&s;s for, and pre|&s;ent intere&s;t in, eternal life.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 135.</NOTE></Q>
But the&s;e two reconci|liations are really but one; for the definition which the Doctor him&s;elf gives of the latter, perfectly agrees with the former. He abundantly holds, that
<Q>that change of &s;tate, into which all men are brought by the death of Chri&s;t,</Q>
<Q>is connected with an actual meetne&s;s for, and pre&s;ent intere&s;t in, eternal life;</Q>
and his whole &s;cheme implies this: otherwi&s;e there is no certainty, that all men will be &s;aved, in con&s;equence of the death of Chri&s;t. The Doctor him&s;elf, in the very next &s;entence to that ju&s;t quoted, allows, that the former reconciliation is <HI>connected</HI> in the &s;cheme of God, with the latter, and <HI>will finally i&s;&s;ue in it.</HI> Now, if his fir&s;t kind of reconciliation be connected with that kind, which is connected with ac|tual meetne&s;s for, and pre&s;ent intere&s;t in, eternal life: then that fir&s;t kind of reconciliation is it&s;elf connected with ac|tual meetne&s;s for, and pre&s;ent intere&s;t in, eternal life. If Jacob be connected with I&s;aac, and I&s;aac be connected with Abraham, then Jacob too is connected with Abraham.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="022478_0212_0FB92EF26B4F0558">LET us now attend to the Doctor's argument from Eph. I. 10:
<Q>That in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fullne&s;s of times, he might gather together in one, all things in Chri&s;t, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</Q>
&mdash;On this text the Doctor &s;ays,
<Q>By means of the lap&s;e, and what has been con&s;equent there|upon, all things in heaven and on earth, were got into a broken, di&s;jointed, di&s;orderly &s;tate; and the good plea|&s;ure of God to reduce them from their pre&s;ent &s;epara|ted, di&s;orderly &s;tate, into one duly-&s;ubjected and well &s;ubordinated whole, may very fitly be &s;ignified by the phra&s;e, <GAP DESC="foreign">, to gather together in one all things. And this I take to be the thing in|tended here.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 144.</NOTE> But what is this to the purpo&s;e of the &s;alvation of all men? It is granted on all hands, that by the lap&s;e, all things relating to men, got into a broken, disjointed, di&s;orderly &s;tate; and that it is the good plea|&s;ure of God to reduce them from their pre&s;ent &s;eparated, di&s;orderly &s;tate&punc; into one duly-&s;ubjected, well &s;ubordinated whole, under Chri&s;t as their head; and that this is the thing intended by the apo&s;tle in this pa&s;&s;age. But if the Doctor &s;uppo&s;ed, that this implied the repentance and &s;al|vation of all men, it was but a mere &s;uppo&s;ition without proof.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a rebellion be excited in the kingdom of a mo&s;t wi&s;e and good prince, and this rebellion extend far and wide, &s;o as to throw the whole kingdom into confu&s;ion. At length the king's &s;on, at the head of his armies, &s;ub|dues the rebels, pardons the generality, &s;entences the leaders, &s;ome to the gallows, others to perpetual impri&s;on|ment: and thus re&s;tores peace, tranquility, good order and government. Is not a well &s;ubjected and duly &s;ubor|dinated &s;tate of things in that kingdom now re&s;tored and e&s;tabli&s;hed, although tho&s;e rebels who are confined in pri|&s;on, &s;till retain their rebellious tempers, and are not in a &s;tate of happine&s;s?</P>
<P>NOR does Dr. C. pretend to point out how a well &s;ubor|dinated &s;tate of things proves the &s;alvation of all men; unle&s;s it be in the following and other pa&s;&s;ages not more conclu&s;ive:
<Q>If God created all men&mdash;by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we may ea&s;ily collect hence, how he comes to be their common Father&mdash;and if they are his children, how fit, proper and rea&s;onable it is, that they &s;hould be fellow

heirs to, and joint partakers in, that happy &s;tate, which he has propo&s;ed &s;hall take place,</Q>
&amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 160.</NOTE> It &s;eems then that Eph. I. 10, proves that all men will be &s;aved, not by any thing contained in the text it&s;elf, but becau&s;e all men are the creatures of God. The argument is this: All men are the creatures of God, therefore that well &s;ub|jected and duly &s;ubordinated &s;tate of things, which is to be effected by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, implies the &s;alvation of all men. It &s;eems then that that well &s;ubjected and duly &s;ubordinated &s;tate of things, does not of it&s;elf imply the final &s;alvation of all men, and therefore this text is introduced with no force of argument. Dr. C. might have argued ju&s;t as forcibly thus, All men are the creatures of God, therefore all men will be &s;aved. But as to this argument it is en|tirely different from Eph. I. 10, and hath been already con&s;idered.</P>
<P>WE are, in the la&s;t place, to attend to Dr. C's argu|ment from 1 Tim. II. 4;
<Q>Who will have all men to be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</Q>
&mdash; The que&s;tions concerning the meaning of this text, are, as Dr. C. ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, two; (1) Who are meant by all men; whether all men individually, or generically. (2) Is there a certain connection between God's willing, that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, and their actual &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHO are meant by <HI>all</HI> men, whether all men indi|vidually, or generically.&mdash;Dr. C. gives two rea&s;ons, why this expre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be under&s;tood of all men individu|ally.</P>
<P N="1">(1)
<Q>That God's willingne&s;s that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, is brought in as an argument to enforce the du|ty of praying for all men,</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 164.</NOTE> mentioned in the fir&s;t and &s;econd ver&s;es. The Doctor takes for granted, that it is our duty to pray for all men individually; and then con|cludes, that all men individually are tho&s;e, whom God wills &s;hould be &s;aved. But it is by no means true, that we are to pray for all men without exception. The a|po&s;tle John expre&s;&s;ly mentions a &s;in unto death, and for tho&s;e who commit that &s;in we are not to pray; 1 John V. 16, 17. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour not only did not in fact pray for the world, but openly and in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner avowed the omi&s;&s;ion; John XVII. 9. And the prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> was forbidden by God, to pray for the
<PB N="209" REF="022478_0214_0FB92EF704AE1308">
Jews, for their good; Jer. XIV. 11. So that when the apo&s;tle in the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the context now under con&s;i|deration, exhorts to pray for all men, we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity, as we would not &s;et the &s;cripture at variance with it&s;elf, under&s;tand him to mean not all individuals without excep|tion.</P>
<P>BESIDE, if it were our duty to pray for all individuals, it may not have been the de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle in this pa&s;|&s;age to inculcate this duty. The Jewi&s;h converts to chri&s;|tianity were full of prejudices again&s;t the Gentiles, and a|bove all, again&s;t the Gentile kings, and tho&s;e, under who&s;e authority they were; and who, in their opinion, had no right to exerci&s;e authority over their nation. Therefore with the utmo&s;t propriety does the apo&s;tle give the exhor|tation contained in the fir&s;t and &s;econd ver&s;es of this con|text, though he meant no more, than that Chri&s;tians &s;hould pray for the Gentiles of every nation, as well as for the Jews, and e&s;pecially for kings and rulers among the Gentiles.</P>
<P N="2">(2) THE other rea&s;on given by Dr. C. why <HI>all men</HI> &s;hould be under&s;tood of all men <HI>individually,</HI> is the rea&s;on given, why God de&s;ires the &s;alvation of all men, viz. that there is one God, and one mediator between God and men. "This," he &s;ays, "is a rea&s;on, which extends to all men" individually, "without limitation." Very true; and it is a rea&s;on, which extends to all men generically too: and therefore is a very good rea&s;on, why we &s;hould pray for the &s;alvation of men of all nations; nor is there any thing in this rea&s;on, which proves, that the apo&s;tle meant, that all men individually would be &s;aved.</P>
<P>AS to Dr. C's rea&s;oning in the following pa&s;&s;age;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 164.</NOTE>
<Q>God is as truly the God of one man, as of another; and there is therefore the &s;ame rea&s;on to think, that he &s;hould be de&s;irous of the &s;alvation of every man, as of any man;</Q>
it is by no means allowed to be conclu&s;ive. It depends on this po&s;tulate, which is a begging of the que&s;tion: That God cannot give exi&s;tence and other com|mon benefits to a man, and not &s;ave him. I might with the &s;ame force argue thus; God is as truly the God of one man, as of another; therefore there is the &s;ame rea&s;on to think, that he &s;hould be de&s;irous of the temporal pro&s;pe|rity of every man, as of &s;ome men. It is no more grant|ed,
<PB N="210" REF="022478_0215_0FB92EFB77D26F90">
and therefore ought no more to be a&s;&s;erted, without proof, that &s;alvation is connected with this circum&s;tance, that God is a God to every man, in the &s;en&s;e in which it is granted, that he is a God to every man, than that tempo|ral pro&s;perity is connected with that circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>FURTHER, that all men individually are intended, Dr. C. argues from this, that the apo&s;tle &s;ays,
<Q>There is one mediator between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q>
The Doctor &s;ays, that the man Je&s;us mediates between God and men univer&s;ally. If by the mediation of Je&s;us, the Doctor meant &s;uch a mediation as will certainly i&s;&s;ue in the &s;alvation of all men; this again is a mere humble beg|ging of the que&s;tion. But if he meant a mediation of the following de&s;cription, that Chri&s;t hath made atonement &s;uf|ficient for all men; is now offering the virtue of that a|tonement to all men; and is u&s;ing a variety of means to per&s;uade all men to accept and tru&s;t in that atonement, and to return to God, &s;eeking his favor and eternal life, for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t alone; it follows not at all from &s;uch a me|diation of Chri&s;t, that all individuals will be &s;aved. It no more follows, than from the facts, that God led the I&s;ra|elites out of Egypt by the hand of a mediator; that he gave them opportunity to enter the land of promi&s;e; and that that mediator was the mediator of that whole gene|ration individually; it followed, that that whole generation individually, would certainly enter the land of promi&s;e.</P>
<P>DR. C. &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 165.</NOTE>
<Q>No good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why the man, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hould mediate between God and <HI>&s;ome men only, to the exclu&s;ion of others.</HI></Q>
Can a good rea&s;on be a&s;&s;igned, why Chri&s;t leads to repentance in this life, &s;ome men only, to the exclu&s;ion or dereliction of o|thers? When &s;uch a rea&s;on &s;hall be a&s;&s;igned, doubtle&s;s we &s;hall be &s;upplied with a rea&s;on, why Chri&s;t &s;hould effectual|ly and &s;avingly mediate in behalf of &s;ome men only.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE other que&s;tion concerning the meaning of this text, which al&s;o Dr. C. notices,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">166</NOTE> is, Whether there be a certain connection between God's willing in the &s;en&s;e of this text, that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, and their actual &s;alvation.&mdash;Dr. C. grants that men as free agents have <HI>power</HI> to oppo&s;e tho&s;e means which God u&s;es with them for their &s;alvation; and yet holds that God has a power to

counteract, in a moral way, this oppo&s;ition of men.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 166, 167.</NOTE> Of this and other remarkable things in Dr. C. on the &s;ubject of <HI>free agency,</HI> particular notice will be taken hereafter. &mdash;In the mean time it may be ob&s;erved, that it appears from various pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, that God is frequently &s;aid to <HI>will</HI> things which do not in fact come into exi&s;tence, or with re&s;pect to which his will is not efficacious: as in the following pa&s;&s;ages: Matt. XXIII. 37.
<Q>O Jeru&s;a|lem, Jeru&s;alem, thou that kille&s;t the prophets and &s;tone&s;t them which are &s;ent unto thee; how often <HI>would I,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings; and ye <HI>would not!</HI></Q>
Ho&s;. XI, 8;
<Q>How &s;hall I give thee up Ephraim? How &s;hall I deliver thee I&s;rael? How &s;hall I make thee as Admah? how &s;hall I &s;et thee as Ze|boim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</Q>
Deut. V. 28, 29;
<Q>They have well &s;aid all that they have &s;poken. O that there were &s;uch an heart in them, that they would fear me and keep my commandments always!</Q>
Chap. XXXII. 28, 29;
<Q>For they are a nation void of coun&s;el, neither is their any under&s;tanding in them. O that they were wi&s;e, that they under&s;tood this, that they would con|&s;ider their latter end!</Q>
P&s;al. LXXXI. 13;
<Q>O that my people had hearkened unto me, and I&s;rael had walk|ed in my ways!</Q>

<Q>O that thou had&s;t hearkened to my commandments! Then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s as the waves of the &s;ea.</Q>
Luke XII. 47;
<Q>And that &s;ervant which knew his Lord's <HI>will,</HI> and prepared not him&s;elf, nei|ther did according to his <HI>will,</HI></Q>
&amp;c. Matt. XXI. 31;
<Q>Whether of them twain did the <HI>will</HI> of his Father? They &s;ay unto him, the fir&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>NOW what right had Dr. C. to &s;uppo&s;e, that the <HI>will of God</HI> in 1 Tim. II. 4, is not u&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as in the pa&s;&s;ages ju&s;t quoted? And if it be u&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, there is no more ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing that the will of God &s;hould be re&s;i&s;ted in the one ca&s;e, than in the other: no more ab&s;urdity in the &s;uppo&s;ition, that God &s;hould will the &s;alvation of all men, and yet all &s;hould not be &s;aved: than that he &s;hould will to gather together the inhabitants of
<PB N="212" REF="022478_0217_0FB92F00E0F55508">
Jeru&s;alem, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings; and yet th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> they &s;hould not be thus gathered.</P>
<P>BESIDE the texts quoted above, I may further refer to Ezek. XVIII. 32;
<Q>I have no plea&s;ure in the death of him that dieth, &s;aith the Lord God.</Q>
Yet his death did, by the words of this text, take place in fact. So that here is a mo&s;t plain in&s;tance of an event which takes place con|trary, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, to the plea&s;ure or will of God.&mdash; Dr. C's rea&s;oning is this; Whatever God wills, will come to pa&s;s. God wills the &s;alvation of all men; there|fore this will come to pa&s;s. To apply this rea&s;oning to the text la&s;t quoted, it will &s;tand thus; Whatever God wills, comes to pa&s;s. But God wills the continued life of him that dieth; therefore it comes to pa&s;s, that he who dieth, does not die.</P>
<P>THE truth is, God wills the &s;alvation of all men, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that he wills the immediate repentance and &s;anctification of all men; or as he wills them to be as per|fect, in this life, as their heavenly Father is perfect. He now commands all men every where to repent, to believe the go&s;pel and to comply with the nece&s;&s;ary conditions of &s;al|vation: and complying with tho&s;e conditions, they &s;hall be &s;aved immediately after the pre&s;ent &s;tate.&mdash;So that God's willing that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, no more proves that all men will be &s;aved, than his willing that all men &s;hould immediately repent, proves, that all will immediately re|pent; or than his willing that all men &s;hould be perfect in this world, and comply with his law as perfectly as the angels do in heaven, proves that the&s;e things will actually take place in this world.</P>
<P>IT is pre&s;umed, that Dr. C. would not have denied, that it is the will of God in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, and that a proper &s;en&s;e too, that all men be brought to repentance in this &s;tate, and that they be &s;aved immediately after this &s;tate. Yet God does not <HI>efficaciou&s;ly</HI> will either of the&s;e things. &mdash;Was it not in a proper &s;en&s;e the will of God, that our fir&s;t parents &s;hould retain their original innocence, and not by their apo&s;tacy deluge the world in &s;in and mi&s;ery? I pre&s;ume this will not be denied. It was his will, if it was his command. But if it was the will of God, that Adam &s;hould &s;tand and not fall; the will of God in this ca&s;e was not efficacious. And if it was not efficacious to prevent the entrance of &s;in into the world, how can we know, that
<PB N="213" REF="022478_0218_0FB92F02C08EB728">
it will be efficacious to extirpate it out of the world, or from among the human race? If God was not in any pro|per &s;en&s;e willing that &s;in and mi&s;ery &s;hould enter and pre|dominate in the world; then it &s;eems, that infinite power and wi&s;dom were in this in&s;tance baffled. And if the&s;e divine perfections have been baffled once, they may be baffled a &s;econd time, and notwith&s;tanding all their at|tempts, &s;in and mi&s;ery may continue without end, in &s;ome of the human race. If on the other hand, although God commanded and in a proper &s;en&s;e willed, that man &s;hould &s;tand: &s;till in another &s;en&s;e he con&s;ented, or willed, that he &s;hould fall: in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e God may con&s;ent, that &s;ome men &s;hall be the &s;ubjects of &s;in and mi&s;ery to an end|le&s;s duration.</P>
<P>DR. C.
<Q>readily owns, that men, as free agents, have the power of <HI>re&s;i&s;ting</HI> and <HI>oppo&s;ing</HI> tho&s;e means, which God from his de&s;ire of their &s;alvation, may &s;ee fit to u&s;e with them.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 166.</NOTE> "Yet it appears" to him
<Q>a gro&s;s re|flection on that being, who is infinitely perfect, to &s;up|po&s;e him unable finally to <HI>counteract,</HI> and in a moral way too, the weakne&s;s, &s;olly and ob&s;tinacy of &s;uch poor inferior creatures, as men are.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 167.</NOTE></Q>
How the&s;e two pro|po&s;itions, which in the Doctor's book occur within a page, can be reconciled with each other; how man can have a power to re&s;i&s;t all the means which God u&s;es to effect his &s;alvation, and at the &s;ame time God can have a power to counteract, in a moral way, this ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance of man, mu&s;t certainly be &s;et down among <HI>the things hard to be under&s;tood</HI> in Dr. C.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps the word <HI>finally</HI> in the &s;econd quotation is emphatical, and Dr. C's meaning is, that though the pow|er of re&s;i&s;ting in man cannot con&s;i&s;tently with free agency be counteracted even by God, at <HI>once,</HI> or in a <HI>&s;hort time</HI>; yet it may be counteracted in a very long time. This how|ever will not agree with Dr. C's own language. He &s;ays,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 166.</NOTE>
<Q>The power in men of re&s;i&s;ting the means, which God from de&s;ire of their &s;alvation &s;ees fit to u&s;e with them, ought not to be overruled, nor indeed can be in con&s;i&s;|tence with moral agency.</Q>
Now to counteract or over|rule in a long time this power of re&s;i&s;ting, is as really to overrule it, as to overrule it in a &s;hort time. But accord|ing to Dr. C. it cannot be overruled in con&s;i&s;tency with
<PB N="214" REF="022478_0219_0FB92F045CFD8628">
moral agency. It &s;eems then, that if the damned &s;hall be finally brought to repentance by God counteracting their ob&s;tinacy, they are &s;tripped of their moral agency.</P>
<P>OR if it be pleaded, that this counteracting is not an <HI>effectual</HI> overruling; but &s;uch an influence of means and motives, as is con&s;i&s;tent with moral agency: &s;till this gives no &s;atisfaction. Is it &s;uch a counteracting, as will <HI>certain|ly</HI> and "<HI>in&s;allibly</HI>" be followed by the repentance and &s;al|vation of the &s;inner? This is holden by Dr. C.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 167.</NOTE> If this be &s;o, what moral power of &s;till re&s;i&s;ting has the &s;inner at the time of his repentance? And if he have at that time no moral power of further re&s;i&s;tance, then this power is overruled <HI>effectually,</HI> and of cour&s;e, according to Dr. C's &s;cheme, the &s;inner is deprived of his moral agency.</P>
<P>IF on the other hand it be &s;aid, that the counteracting be not &s;uch as will certainly and "infallibly" be followed by the repentance of the &s;inner; then there is no certainty that the &s;inner will ever under the mo&s;t powerful means which God &s;hall u&s;e with him, be brought to repentance and be &s;aved. Thus the certainty of univer&s;al &s;alvation at once comes to nothing. There is no certainty, no ground of a&s;&s;urance, that all will be &s;aved; and all the truth is, that God will u&s;e means with &s;inners hereafter, as he does in this &s;tate, to prepare them for &s;alvation; but as in this &s;tate, &s;o in the future, &s;inners may, or may not, comply with tho&s;e means.</P>
<P>TO Dr. C.
<Q>it appeared a gro&s;s reflection on that be|ing who is infinitely perfect, to &s;uppo&s;e him unable <HI>fi|nally</HI> to counteract, and in a moral way too, the ob&s;ti|nacy of men.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 167.</NOTE> But is it no reflection on God, to &s;uppo&s;e him not to have been able in a moral way, to prevent the entrance of &s;in into the world? Is it no reflection on him to &s;uppo&s;e, that he is not able in a moral way to counteract the ob&s;tinacy of men in this life? Is it no reflection to &s;uppo&s;e, that he is not able, by the powerful means u&s;ed in hell, to counteract it, in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, for the &s;pace of a thou&s;and years?<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See p. 402, 403.</NOTE> How long mu&s;t God be unable to counteract human ob&s;tinacy, before the imputation of &s;uch inability becomes a reflection on him?

duration of it cannot be imputed to him without a reflec|tion? If it be no reflection on God, to &s;ay, that he is unable to counteract that ob&s;tinacy within a thou&s;and years; is it a reflection to &s;ay, that he is unable to counteract it in two thou&s;and, in ten thou&s;and, or in an hundred thou&s;and years? If not, why does it become a reflection to &s;ay, that he is unable <HI>finally</HI> to counteract it?&mdash;Let any be|liever in Dr. C's &s;cheme an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions.</P>
<P>DOCTOR C's rea&s;oning in the following pa&s;&s;age, is worthy of notice; <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 168.</NOTE>
<Q>If God de&s;ires the &s;alvation of all, and Chri&s;t died that this de&s;ire of God might be complied with, is it credible that a &s;mall portion of men only &s;hould be &s;aved in event?</Q>
&mdash;This rea|&s;oning may be retorted thus: If God de&s;ires that all men be &s;aved immediately after this life, and Chri&s;t died that this de&s;ire might be complied with; is it credible, that a &s;mall portion of men only &s;hould be then &s;aved?</P>
<P>THE advocates for univer&s;al &s;alvation, one and all, bring in the text now under con&s;ideration,
<Q>Who will have all men to be &s;aved,</Q>
as a proof of their doctrine. Therefore I wi&s;h to a&s;k them, from what they believe all men are, according to the&s;e words, to be &s;aved? From an endle&s;s puni&s;hment? Then they were by a divine con|&s;titution expo&s;ed to an endle&s;s puni&s;hment; then an endle&s;s puni&s;hment is ju&s;t; then &s;in de&s;erves an endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment; then &s;in is an infinite evil; which to them is an in|finitely horrible doctrine. But let them, if they can, avoid it, once allowing that all men are to be &s;aved from an endle&s;s puni&s;hment. Or are all men, according to the&s;e words, to be &s;aved from a temporary puni&s;hment? What temporary puni&s;hment? Not that which is to continue for ages of ages: &s;ome will &s;uffer that. Not from a longer temporary pu|ni&s;hment; becau&s;e none &s;uch is threatened; and &s;inners are not expo&s;ed to a puni&s;hment greater than that which is threatened in the divine law.&mdash;On the whole, accord|ing to univer&s;ali&s;m, the&s;e words mean, that all men &s;hall be &s;aved indeed, but &s;hall be &s;aved from&mdash;NOTHING.</P>

<Q>Thou ha&s;t put all things under his feet.</Q>
He was of the opinion, that tho&s;e words mean, by the univer&s;ality of the terms, that even <HI>&s;in it&s;elf</HI> &s;hall be &s;ubjected to Chri&s;t; and that &s;in can|not be &s;ubjected to Chri&s;t in any other way, than by the de|&s;truction of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 179.</NOTE> But this is to &s;uppo&s;e what is by no means granted, and ought not to have been a&s;&s;erted without proof. An enemy may be overpowered, taken, impri&s;on|ed, and put entirely under the power, or under the feet of the conqueror; and yet not be put to death or annihila|ted. When it is &s;aid Chri&s;t's <HI>enemies &s;hall be made his foot&s;tool,</HI> P&s;al. CX. 1, Heb. X. 13; No one will pretend, that this means either a cordial &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Chri&s;t, or an|nihilation. When the captains of I&s;rael put their feet on the necks of the Canaaniti&s;h kings, Jo&s;h. X. 24, as this was no token of cordial &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion or reconciliation; &s;o it is certain, that tho&s;e kings were not then annihilated. The &s;ame idea is naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by that expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Put under his feet.</HI> Not any of the&s;e phra&s;es is allowed to be u&s;ed in &s;cripture, to expre&s;s either a cordial &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, or annihilation. Sin is &s;uch an enemy, as never can in its nature be reduced to a cordial &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Chri&s;t. Nor needs it to be annihilated, to an&s;wer the expre&s;&s;ion of being put under the feet of Chri&s;t: Nor indeed does that expre&s;&s;ion naturally &s;ugge&s;t the idea of annihilation; but na|turally, if not nece&s;&s;arily implies the contrary. An enemy may be under the feet of his conqueror before he is anni|hilated, but after he is annihilated, he is neither under his feet, nor in any other place. To be under the feet there|fore implies exi&s;tence: and &s;in may properly be &s;aid to be put under the feet of Chri&s;t, when it is &s;o re&s;trained and exemplarily puni&s;hed, that on the whole no di&s;honour is done by it to Chri&s;t, or to the Deity; no evil re&s;ults from

<P>DR. C. makes a di&s;tinction between God's government of <HI>power</HI> and his <HI>moral</HI> government: by which it is &s;up|po&s;ed, that he meant to &s;how, that &s;in cannot be brought into &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t, but by the willing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the &s;inner.
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 179.</NOTE>Men by &s;inning oppo&s;e the government of God; not his government of <HI>power</HI>; for this ever was, and ever will, and ever mu&s;t be, &s;ubmitted to; but his <HI>moral</HI> government which he exerci&s;es over intel|ligent and free agents. Here is room for oppo&s;ition. Men may re&s;i&s;t that will of God, which requires their obedience,</Q>
&amp;c. It may be pre&s;umed, that the pa&s;|&s;age now quoted was entirely out of the Doctor's mind, when he wrote the following;
<Q>'Tis readily acknowledg|ed, the glory of Chri&s;t's <HI>power,</HI> as head of the govern|ment of God, will be <HI>illu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;played,</HI> if <HI>by force only</HI> he finally &s;ubdues ob&s;tinate &s;inners.</Q>
By this it ap|pears, that it was Dr. C's opinion, that men do oppo&s;e the <HI>power</HI> of Chri&s;t, and the power Chri&s;t <HI>as the head of the government of God</HI> too; and that his power may be il|lu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;played, if it be employed to &s;ubdue <HI>by force</HI> their ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition. But to &s;ay, that power and force are employed to &s;ubdue ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition, and yet that this oppo&s;ition is no oppo&s;ition to that power and force, is as ab&s;urd, as to &s;ay, that a prince exerts his power and force to &s;ubdue the oppo&s;ition of an army of rebels, and yet that tho&s;e rebels do not at all oppo&s;e his power; or it is as ab&s;urd as to &s;ay, that oppo&s;ition can be &s;ubdued where there is no oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>IT is by no means clear what Dr. C. meant by God's government of <HI>power,</HI> as oppo&s;ed to his <HI>moral</HI> government. Can there be any government without power? It is plain by the la&s;t quotation, that Dr. C. did not imagine, that God's moral government is without either <HI>power</HI> or <HI>force,</HI> and that both power and force may be employed to &s;ub|due &s;inners, who as &s;inners are &s;ubjects of God's moral go|vernment only.&mdash;But let the Doctor have meant by this di&s;tinction what he will, it is by no means true, that &s;in|ners
<PB N="218" REF="022478_0223_0FB92F0CB94ADAD8">
are always &s;o far re&s;trained and &s;ubjected by God's moral government, that in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, and if all things were to remain as they now are, no di&s;honour would be done to God, no injury to his kingdom, to his cho&s;en people, or to the intellectual &s;y&s;tem. There is room therefore for &s;in and &s;inners, in this &s;en&s;e, to be &s;ub|jected and re&s;trained by the government of God. When
<Q>the wrath of men &s;hall prai&s;e God, and the remainder of wrath &s;hall be re&s;trained,</Q>
then will &s;inners be brought to that &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t, of which I am &s;peak|ing. But Dr. C. would not pretend, that in this &s;en&s;e, &s;inners <HI>ever</HI> have been, <HI>ever</HI> will be, and ever <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;ubject to God.&mdash;In one word, to be &s;ubjected to Chri&s;t is to be made either actively or pa&s;&s;ively &s;ub&s;ervient to his purpo&s;es and to his glory.</P>
<P>WHEN the enemies of a prince are overcome, and in chains and pri&s;ons are re&s;trained from interrupting the peace and happine&s;s of his faithful &s;ubjects; then they are put under his feet and are &s;ubjected to him, and all their "rule, authority and power, are put down or aboli&s;hed." So when all the enemies of Chri&s;t, all "ob&s;tinate &s;inners" &s;hall be, to u&s;e Dr. C's own words,
<Q>by force finally &s;ub|dued,</Q>
&s;hut up in pri&s;on, bound with chains, and pre|vented from doing the lea&s;t mi&s;chief to the di&s;ciples and kingdom of Chri&s;t; then tho&s;e enemies will be put under the feet of Chri&s;t; then
<Q>an end will be put to the do|minion of &s;in;</Q>
then the works of the devil will be de|&s;troyed; then the &s;erpents head will be brui&s;ed, and the devil's kingdom will be overthrown, as really and effectu|ally, as the power of a rebel can be overthrown by an en|tire conque&s;t of him and his adherents, by his perpetual impri&s;onment and other proper puni&s;hment according to the laws of the kingdom, though he and &s;ome of his parti|zans be permitted to live, and though they retain a rebel|lious &s;pirit.&mdash;The verb <GAP DESC="foreign">
in Rom. VIII. 20, &s;ig|nifies, as Dr. C. holds, an involuntary &s;ubjection. It may therefore mean the &s;ame in Heb. II. 8, and 1 Cor. XV. 27, &amp;c,</P>
<P>DOCTOR C. in&s;i&s;ts on the words in 1 John, III. 8,

<P>THAT God has always power to &s;ubdue or to &s;ubject to him&s;elf his enemies, is one thing: actually to &s;ubject them, by re&s;training them from doing any damage to his king|dom or his &s;ubjects, is another.

<P>THEREFORE, as P&s;al. VIII. 5, 6; Heb. II. 6&mdash;9, are fairly capable of a con&s;truction entirely different from that on which Dr. C's whole argument from them depends; they prove nothing to his purpo&s;e: e&s;pecially as they are not naturally capable of his con&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="022478_0225_0FB92F15F50DD920">WE are now to attend to Phil. II. 9, 10, 11;

&mdash;The que&s;tion concerning this text is the &s;ame as that concerning the text la&s;t under con&s;ideration; What are we to under&s;tand by that &s;ubjection, to which Chri&s;t in con&s;equence of his exaltation, was to reduce mankind? Is it a free and vo|luntary &s;ubjection in all men? Or in &s;ome men a &s;ubjec|tion to which they &s;hall be reduced by the power and au|thority of Chri&s;t, in oppo&s;ition to their own inclinations?

<P>AS to the Doctor's <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> to prove that the &s;ubjection in que&s;tion is a free and voluntary one, they are as fol|lows; That Chri&s;t is now endeavouring to reduce man|kind to a voluntary &s;ubjection to him&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 190.</NOTE>&mdash;That though Chri&s;t do not in this &s;tate, prevail on all men voluntarily to &s;ubject them&s;elves to him, yet he may prevail on them in the next &s;tate.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 191.</NOTE>&mdash;That if Chri&s;t was exalted for this end, that every knee &s;hould bow to him, &amp;c. he will fail of his end unle&s;s all men be reduced to a voluntary &s;ub|jection<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 192.</NOTE>&mdash;That the genuflection in this Phil.

II. 9, &amp;c. means a voluntary &s;ubjection.&mdash;An&s;wer: Chri&s;t is now in no other &s;en&s;e endeavouring to bring all to a voluntary &s;ubjection, than in the days of his incarnation he endea|voured to gather the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings: or tha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

always has endeavoured to prevent the death of him that dieth. But as tho&s;e endeavours have not been efficacious; &s;o his endeavours to bring all men to a voluntary &s;ubjec|tion, may not be. Therefore this argument proves no|thing.</P>
<P N="2">2. Though Chri&s;t do not in this &s;tate prevail on all men voluntarily to &s;ubject them&s;elves to him; yet he may pre|vail on them in the next &s;tate: therefore in the next &s;tate all <HI>will in fact</HI> be brought to a voluntary &s;ubjection: there|fore Phil. II. 9, &amp;c. means voluntary &s;ubjection.&mdash;An|&s;wer: It does not follow from the <HI>power</HI> of Chri&s;t to re|duce all men to a voluntary &s;ubjection, that he <HI>will in fact,</HI> reduce them to that &s;ubjection.</P>
<P N="3">3. If Chri&s;t were exalted for this end, that every knee &s;hould bow to him, &amp;c. he will fail of the end of his ex|altation, unle&s;s all be reduced to a voluntary &s;ubjection. &mdash;An&s;wer: The con&s;equence by no means follows from the antecedent. For though it be allowed that Chri&s;t was exalted for the end, that every knee &s;hould bow to him; yet it is not allowed that this bowing of the knee is a vo|luntary &s;ubjection. So that Chri&s;t may obtain the whole end of his exaltation, without effecting a voluntary &s;ubjec|tion of all men. This argument takes for granted, that the bowing of the knee mentioned in Phil. II. 10, is a voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="4">4. The genuflection in Phil. II. 10, evidently means a voluntary act.&mdash;An&s;wer: It does not evidently mean a voluntary act.&mdash;A mere contradiction is a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to a mere a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P N="5">5. A compelled &s;ubjection is a poor, low kind of &s;ub|jection in compari&s;on with that which is voluntary. There|fore the reward of Chri&s;t's humiliation, unle&s;s it imply a voluntary &s;ubjection of all mankind, is low and &s;mall in compari&s;on with what it would have been, had it implied a voluntary &s;ubjection. Therefore it does imply a volun|tary &s;ubjection; therefore a voluntary &s;ubjection is intend|ed in Phil. II. 10.</P>
<P>ANSWER: We are very improper per&s;ons to determine <HI>a priori</HI> what is the proper reward of Chri&s;t, or what re|ward is the greate&s;t, and mo&s;t honourable to Chri&s;t. Some may imagine it would be mo&s;t honourable to Chri&s;t, to re|duce all men to a voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in this life; as in that ca&s;e they would be &s;aved from <HI>all</HI> future puni&s;hment;
<PB N="222" REF="022478_0227_0FB92F196B29BA78">
and thus might the grace, power and wi&s;dom of Chri&s;t in their opinion be more glorified. Hence they might ar|gue ju&s;t as forcibly as Dr. C. does in the other ca&s;e, That undoubtedly Chri&s;t will in this life reduce all men to a vo|luntary &s;ubjection to him&s;elf. On the &s;ame principle it might al&s;o have been proved, before the fact &s;hewed the contrary, that all men would be reduced to a voluntary &s;ub|jection to Chri&s;t, in a very &s;hort time, long before the time of their ordinary departure out of life. On the &s;ame principle too it might have been proved, that God would never permit &s;in and mi&s;ery to enter the world.&mdash;Thus it appears, that Dr. C's argument, if it prove any thing, proves too much, therefore proves nothing.</P>
<P>THE Doctor was not in&s;en&s;ible, that the &s;ame words are quoted by the Apo&s;tle Paul, and applied to the general judgment; at which time Dr. C. does not pretend, that all men will be voluntarily &s;ubject to Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 196.</NOTE> See Rom. XIV. 10, 11, 12.
<Q>For we &s;hall all &s;tand before the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t. For it is written, as I live, &s;aith the Lord, every knee &s;hall bow to me, and every tongue &s;hall confe&s;s to God. So then every one of us &s;hall give account of him&s;elf to God.</Q>
Therefore we have clear evidence, that the&s;e words do &s;ometimes mean that &s;ubjection which is not voluntary. And that in Phil. II. 10, they mean a voluntary &s;ubjection and that only, we mu&s;t have good evidence, before we are obliged to be|lieve it. The utmo&s;t evidence which Dr. C. gives us, re|&s;pecting that matter, I have exhibited above; and con|cerning the &s;ufficiency of it, the reader will judge.</P>
<P>DOCTOR C. acknowledges,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> that the words are perti|nently applied by the Apo&s;tle, to that &s;ubjection which &s;hall take place as to all, at the general judgment: but &s;ays that his thus applying them is no argument that they mean no|thing more. To which it may be an&s;wered, that it is an argument that they mean nothing more in Phil. II. 10, unle&s;s good rea&s;on can be given to &s;how, that in this pa&s;|&s;age they do mean more: and whether the rea&s;ons which Dr. C. gives, be good and &s;atisfactory, is &s;ubmitted as before.</P>
<P>WE come at length to the con&s;ideration of that pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, which Dr. C.

<P>THE Doctor prefaces his critici&s;m on this text, with &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the previous context, which demand our fir&s;t attention.&mdash;He quotes the 21&s;t and 22d ver&s;es;
<Q>For &s;ince by man came death, by man came al&s;o the re|&s;urrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive:</Q>
and adds,
<Q>It is with me beyond all controver&s;y evident, that the apo&s;|tle is &s;peaking here, not of a partial, but univer&s;al re|&s;urrection, not of the re&s;urrection of the righteous on|ly, but of the whole race of Adam.&mdash;The &s;ame all who &s;uffer death through Adam, &s;hall through Chri&s;t be made alive. The compari&s;on between the damage by Adam and the advantage by Chri&s;t, lies in this very thing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 201.</NOTE></Q>
Here we have the Doctor's opinion, and his rea&s;on for it. His opinion is, that in the 22d ver&s;e the a|po&s;tle is &s;peaking of all mankind: his rea&s;on for this opi|nion is, that otherwi&s;e there would be no proper compari|&s;on of Adam and Chri&s;t. But the truth of this ob&s;ervati|on is by no means conceded. The reader may have &s;een my ideas of this ca&s;e in the remarks made above, on Rom. V. 12, &amp;c.&mdash;If an army under one general be all killed or taken, and afterwards the &s;urviving part of the &s;ame army, now liberated, and under the command of another general, return every one in &s;afety from a dangerous bat|tle; it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, As under the former general all the army was killed or taken, &s;o under the latter ge|neral all the army returned from the battle in &s;afety. There would in this ca&s;e be a true and proper compari&s;on. Yet the very &s;ame all would not be intended in both parts of the compari&s;on. Dr. C's rea&s;on therefore is not &s;ufficient
<PB N="224" REF="022478_0229_0FB92F1EAFB27AD0">
to &s;upport his con&s;truction. There is a proper compari&s;on of Adam and Chri&s;t, if the apo&s;tle &s;ay, and intended to &s;ay, As in Adam all his &s;eed die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t all his &s;eed &s;hall be made alive.</P>
<P>IT is indeed a truth granted on all hands, that all man|kind will be rai&s;ed at the la&s;t day; but it does not hence follow, that the apo&s;tle in this ver&s;e is &s;peaking of &s;uch an univer&s;al re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>BESIDE, if it &s;hould be granted, that the 22d ver&s;e re|fers to the re&s;urrection of all men, it would not follow, that all will be &s;aved. For Dr. C. grants, that had the apo&s;tle
<Q>no where el&s;e opened his mind more fully and particularly upon this matter, the utmo&s;t we could have argued from his words, would have been, that as all men die in Adam, &s;o in Chri&s;t they &s;hould all be deli|vered from this death, by a re&s;urrection to life.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 201.</NOTE></Q>
How then does this text prove univer&s;al &s;alvation? And e&s;pecially how is this ver&s;e, or even the whole pa&s;&s;age
<Q>of it&s;elf <HI>deci&s;ive</HI>?</Q>
Although Dr. C. in page 197, declares his opinion, that this pa&s;&s;age is
<Q>deci&s;ive of it&s;elf, was there no other text in all the Bible of the like import;</Q>
yet he him&s;elf in page 207, gives it up as deci&s;ive, in the following words;
<Q>This parenthe&s;is, comprehended with|in the 24th and 29th ver&s;es, was purpo&s;ely interpo&s;ed to bring us to a pau&s;e&mdash;and give us opportunity&mdash; to reflect upon&mdash;the truths&mdash;here revealed; pur|&s;uing them in their ju&s;t tendency, nece&s;&s;ary connection and final re&s;ult: In the doing of which, we &s;hould <HI>vir|tually continue</HI> the di&s;cour&s;e, and fini&s;h it with re|&s;pect to the wicked, as the apo&s;tle had done&mdash;with re&s;pect to the righteous.</Q>
Thus it appears by the au|thority of Dr. C. that this portion of &s;cripture does not contain any thing plain, or po&s;itive concerning the &s;alva|tion of tho&s;e who die in wickedne&s;s; but to inve&s;tigate that which to him was &s;o important and favourite a doctrine, we mu&s;t <HI>virtually</HI> continue and fini&s;h the di&s;cour&s;e our|&s;elves. How then is this pa&s;&s;age deci&s;ive of it&s;elf? Unle&s;s we virtually continue and fini&s;h the di&s;cour&s;e our&s;elves with re&s;pect to the wicked, as the apo&s;tle had done with re&s;pect to the righteous, we &s;hall never, even in Dr. C's opinion come to the &s;ame conclu&s;ion concerning the wicked, to which the apo&s;tle came concerning the righteous, that they &s;hall be &s;aved.</P>

<P>THAT in the &s;en&s;e now explained, the mediatorial &s;cheme will not be fini&s;hed at the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t, is in|deed a point in di&s;pute, and the Doctor's proofs of this point are to be candidly weighed. They are the&s;e two&mdash;(1) This pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture teaches, that an uni|ver&s;al &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t is to be effected before the fini&s;h|ing of the mediatory &s;cheme; but this univer&s;al &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t is not effected at the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t.&mdash; (2) The reward of the good and faithful &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t is to be be&s;towed on them in the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and therefore Chri&s;t's kingdom will not be at an end, till after they &s;hall have enjoyed that reward for &s;ome time at lea&s;t. &mdash;I think the&s;e two are all the rea&s;ons which Dr. C. has given to &s;upport the propo&s;ition in que&s;tion. He has in|deed divided his long and complicated di&s;cour&s;e on the text now before us, into five heads: but for what rea&s;on is not manife&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">I. IT was the opinion of Dr. C. that 1 Cor. XV. 24-29, teaches us, that an univer&s;al &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t is to be effected before the fini&s;hing of the mediatorial &s;cheme, which is not effected at Chri&s;t's &s;econd coming.&mdash;By &s;ub|jection to Chri&s;t Dr. C. meant with re&s;pect to intelligent creatures, a cordial, willing &s;ubjection. By &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t, with re&s;pect to &s;in and death the fir&s;t and &s;econd, he &s;eems to have meant <HI>abolition.</HI> But though it is agreed
<PB N="226" REF="022478_0231_0FB92F236D94BF38">
on all hands, that there will be an univer&s;al &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t effected, before the fini&s;hing of the mediatorial &s;cheme; yet it is not agreed that this &s;ubjection, with re|ference to all intelligent creatures, will be a willing &s;ub|jection or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Concerning this particular, &s;ome ob|&s;ervations have been made in the former part of this chap|ter. That the text now under con&s;ideration does teach a willing &s;ubjection, mu&s;t be &s;hown, or the text will not ap|pear to be to the purpo&s;e.&mdash;Now to &s;how, that all intel|ligent creatures will be cordially &s;ubjected to Chri&s;t, and will be &s;aved, the Doctor in&s;i&s;ts, that both &s;in and the &s;e|cond death will be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT &s;in will be de&s;troyed. With reference to tho&s;e words, "he mu&s;t reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet"&mdash;"All things &s;hall be &s;ubdued unto him"&mdash;The Doc|tor a&s;ks, "Is <HI>&s;in</HI> an <HI>enemy</HI>?"&mdash;Suppo&s;ing it is an enemy, what follows? Not what the Doctor a&s;&s;erts, "Then it will be <HI>de&s;troyed,</HI>" meaning aboli&s;hed, extirpated by uni|ver&s;al obedience and virtue. For the apo&s;tle does not &s;ay, that all enemies &s;hall be <HI>de&s;troyed,</HI> aboli&s;hed, extirpated or annihilated: but that all enemies &s;hall be <HI>&s;ubdued</HI> and <HI>put under Chri&s;t's feet.</HI> So that the true and only con&s;equence from the &s;uppo&s;ition, that &s;in is an enemy, is, that it &s;hall be &s;ubdued, re&s;trained and put under Chri&s;t's feet; which may be done in a &s;en&s;e true, proper, and as Dr. C. grants,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 193.</NOTE> glorious to Chri&s;t, without the abolition of it.</P>
<P>INDEED the apo&s;tle &s;ays, that
<Q>the la&s;t enemy, death, &s;hall be de&s;troyed;</Q>
which by no means implies, that all other enemies &s;hall be de&s;troyed. It may mean, what our tran&s;lators evidently under&s;tood by it, that the la&s;t in|&s;tance which we &s;hall have of the de&s;truction of any enemy, will be in the de&s;truction of death.&mdash;The words literal|ly, and according to the order of the original, are thus tran&s;|lated; the la&s;t enemy is de&s;troyed death; and they may mean, and may very properly be rendered thus, Death is de&s;troyed the la&s;t enemy. Now &s;uppo&s;e an hi&s;torian, in the account of a battle, &s;hould &s;ay, The general was killed the la&s;t enemy: mu&s;t we nece&s;&s;arily under&s;tand him to mean, that all the enemies of the whole army were kil|led, and the general was killed after all the re&s;t? Might not his words be ju&s;tly taken in this &s;en&s;e, that the general was the la&s;t enemy who fell, and many others might e&s;cape?</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="022478_0232_0FB92F268E665B08">OR death may by the apo&s;tle be called the la&s;t enemy proverbially and with re&s;pect to this life only; as it is now &s;ometimes called the la&s;t debt due to nature. Since the expre&s;&s;ion,
<Q>the la&s;t enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed is death,</Q>
is capable of this &s;en&s;e; and &s;ince it does not appear, that it implies, that all other enemies will be de|&s;troyed: therefore it is no proof of univer&s;al &s;alvation; as both &s;in and mi&s;ery may &s;till be allowed to be enemies, and yet may be in exi&s;tence, after the de&s;truction of death.</P>
<P>BUT it may be a&s;&s;erted in a true and proper &s;en&s;e, that &s;in, in the damned, is not an enemy. It does no damage to Chri&s;t, to his kingdom, or to the peace and happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects. It is to be &s;ure, an enemy in no other &s;en&s;e, than the damned them&s;elves are enemies: and if from that expre&s;&s;ion,
<Q>the la&s;t enemy that is <HI>de&s;troyed, aboli&s;hed,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, is death,</Q>
it follow, that all Chri&s;t's enemies will be aboli&s;hed or annihilated; it will al&s;o follow, that all the damned will be annihilated. So that if this ar|gument prove any thing, it proves too much; &s;o much that it entirely overthrows univer&s;al &s;alvation.</P>
<P>BUT &s;in in the damned, and the damned them&s;elves, in&s;tead of doing any damage to Chri&s;t or his &s;ubjects, will be the means of increa&s;ing the glory of the former and the happine&s;s of the latter, to eternity.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable, that the verb <GAP DESC="foreign">
is never in all the New Te&s;tament, applied to expre&s;s the de&s;truction of all wicked men, of the enemies of God in general, or of all &s;in. Therefore as neither &s;in it&s;elf, nor all the enemies of God, are &s;aid <GAP DESC="foreign">, to be <HI>aboli&s;hed,</HI> we have no right, even on the &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;in is an enemy in eve|ry &s;en&s;e, to &s;ay that it will be <HI>aboli&s;hed,</HI> or extirpated from the univer&s;e.&mdash;The peculiar phra&s;eology of the pa&s;&s;age now under con&s;ideration, is worthy of particular notice. In the 24th ver&s;e it is &s;aid, that Chri&s;t will
<Q><HI>aboli&s;h,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, all rule and all authority and power.</Q>
But he is &s;aid to put all his enemies under his feet, <GAP DESC="foreign">, ver&s;e 25th, and to put all things under his feet, <GAP DESC="foreign">, ver&s;e 27th. Although there|fore all the <HI>rule,</HI> and all the <HI>authority</HI> and <HI>power</HI> of Chri&s;t's enemies &s;hall be aboli&s;hed, and the apo&s;tle is careful to in|form us of that; yet he is equally careful to inform us, that his enemies them&s;elves &s;hall be only <HI>&s;ubjected</HI> to him,
<PB N="228" REF="022478_0233_0FB92F29E4BCFFB0">
and put under his feet; as it &s;eems, de&s;ignedly &s;hifting the phra&s;eology and avoiding the application of the verb <GAP DESC="foreign">
to them. What right then have we to apply it to them? Is not the application of words to per&s;ons or things, to which the apo&s;tle de&s;ignedly did not apply them, a gro&s;s perver&s;ion of &s;cripture?</P>
<P>DOCTOR C's argument that &s;in will be de&s;troyed, de|pends wholly on this general propo&s;ition, That all Chri&s;t's enemies will be de&s;troyed. Now the word de&s;troyed in this ca&s;e, doubtle&s;s means either <HI>abolition,</HI> or <HI>re&s;traint</HI> and <HI>puni&s;hment.</HI> If it mean <HI>abolition, extirpation, annihilation</HI>; then as was before ob&s;erved, all the enemies of Chri&s;t will be annihilated, and the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation falls to the ground at once. If it mean <HI>re&s;traint, puni&s;hment, preventing from doing mi&s;chief,</HI> &amp;c, then &s;in may be &s;aid to be de&s;troyed, and yet have an endle&s;s exi&s;tence in the uni|ver&s;e.</P>
<P>IF then the&s;e words,
<Q>The la&s;t enemy death &s;hall be de&s;troyed,</Q>
do certainly imply, that all Chri&s;t's ene|mies &s;hall be de&s;troyed? and if it be al&s;o certain, that &s;in <HI>in the damned</HI> is, in every proper &s;en&s;e, an enemy, tho&s;e words are equally incon&s;i&s;tent with Dr. C's &s;cheme, as with the oppo&s;ite. They either imply an univer&s;al annihi|lation of all Chri&s;t's enemies; and &s;o are equally incon&s;i&s;t|ent with univer&s;al &s;alvation, as with endle&s;s torment; or they are not at all incon&s;i&s;tent with it, and therefore are no argument again&s;t it. If they imply an univer&s;al anni|hilation of the enemies of Chri&s;t, as they are equally a|gain&s;t Dr. C's &s;cheme, as again&s;t the oppo&s;ite; it equal|ly concerns him, as his opponents, to provide an an&s;wer to them, and it is ab&s;urd in him to object them to the doc|trine of his opponents.</P>
<P>THE &s;um of what has been &s;aid on this head of the de|&s;truction of &s;in is (1) That it does not appear, that &s;in in the damned is properly an enemy to Chri&s;t and his king|dom; as it does no harm to that kingdom. (2) If it be determined that &s;in in the damned is an enemy to Chri&s;t, it will not follow, that it will be <HI>de&s;troyed,</HI> meaning by de|&s;truction <HI>annihilation</HI> or <HI>abolition</HI>; becau&s;e it is no where &s;aid, that all Chri&s;t's enemies will be de&s;troyed, <GAP DESC="foreign">. &mdash;Or even if this were a&s;&s;erted concerning all Chri&s;t's enemies, and the verb <GAP DESC="foreign">
were applied to them all, it would not certainly determine, that they will all be an|nihilated,
<PB N="229" REF="022478_0234_0FB92F2AACB962F8">
as that verb is capable of another &s;en&s;e, and is doubtle&s;s u&s;ed in another &s;en&s;e, Heb. II. 14;
<Q>That through death he might <HI>de&s;troy,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, him that had the power of death, that is the devil.</Q>
Dr. C. did not believe, that the devil will be annihilated. Therefore if that verb were applied to all Chri&s;t's enemies, and &s;in in the damned were allowed to be an enemy to Chri&s;t; &s;till it might mean &s;omething el&s;e be&s;ide annihilation: nay, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily mean &s;omething el&s;e, or it would equally di&s;prove univer|&s;al &s;alvation, as endle&s;s mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>IN Dr. C's di&s;cour&s;e on this &s;ubject, it is implied, that when a &s;inner is brought to repentance and cordial recon|ciliation to Chri&s;t, he is <HI>de&s;troyed.</HI> His words are,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 214, 215.</NOTE>
<Q>Chri&s;t &s;hall continue ve&s;ted with regal power, till he has brought all enemies into <HI>&s;ubjection</HI> to him&mdash;Chri&s;t will continue head of the kingdom of God&mdash;till he has actually <HI>&s;ubdued</HI> all enemies&mdash;Is &s;in an enemy?&mdash; then it &s;hall be <HI>de&s;troyed</HI>&mdash;for Chri&s;t mu&s;t <HI>de&s;troy</HI> all enemies.</Q>
By the&s;e &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions it appears, that it was Dr. C's opinion, that all Chri&s;t's enemies will be <HI>&s;ubjected</HI> to him, that they all will be <HI>&s;ubdued</HI> under him, and that they will all be <HI>de&s;troyed</HI> by him. Now it is a|bundantly evident, that by <HI>&s;ubjection, &s;ubduing,</HI> &amp;c, when applied to tho&s;e, who die in impenitence, Dr. C. meant a cordial reconciliation to Chri&s;t: and he by no means held, that the&s;e enemies thus reconciled, will be de&s;troyed by annihilation. It follows therefore, that as all Chri&s;t's enemies are to be de&s;troyed, to be <HI>de&s;troyed,</HI> and to be <HI>re|conciled to Chri&s;t in true repentance,</HI> are, according to Dr. C. one and the &s;ame thing. Therefore, when Paul was converted, he was <HI>de&s;troyed</HI>; and as he will eternally be the &s;ubject of repentance, he will &s;uffer an eternal de&s;truc|tion. The puni&s;hment of God's enemies is, that they &s;hall be de&s;troyed; they &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de|&s;truction. But what puni&s;hment are everla&s;ting repentance and complacency in God? they are among the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings which Deity him&s;elf can confer on a creature. Endle&s;s de&s;truction and endle&s;s &s;alvation are throughout the &s;criptures oppo&s;ed to each other. But according to Dr. C's &s;cheme, they perfectly harmonize and mutually imply each other.&mdash;Now whether this &s;cheme harmo|nize with the &s;criptures is &s;ubmitted to the reader.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="022478_0235_0FB92F2F52AFC870">WHETHER this &s;cheme harmonize with the &s;criptures or not,, it does not harmonize with other parts of Dr. C's book.

<Q>we are very obviou&s;ly led to under&s;tand <HI>mi&s;ery.</HI></Q>

<P>DR. C. holds, that all enemies will be &s;ubdued and &s;ub|jected to Chri&s;t, and that &s;in will be &s;ubjected to him, when it is aboli&s;hed or annihilated. But if &s;in be &s;ubject|ed to Chri&s;t, when it is annihilated, then the &s;inner would be &s;ubjected to Chri&s;t were he annihilated. But this kind of &s;ubjection is no more a cordial &s;ubjection, than that which is effected by mere power, and which con&s;i&s;ts in re|&s;traint and puni&s;hment.&mdash;Be&s;ide, according to Dr. C. there are two ways of &s;ubjecting to Chri&s;t intended in this pa&s;&s;age; one is by cordial reconciliation, the other is by annihilation. This then will keep in countenance the op|ponents of Dr. C. who believe, that there are two ways of &s;ubjecting to Chri&s;t; one by cordial reconciliation, which re&s;pects the elect only; the other by re&s;traint and puni&s;h|ment, which re&s;pects the reprobate.</P>
<P>ON the whole, whether this pa&s;&s;age be &s;ufficient to prove an univer&s;al abolition of &s;in, is now left to the judg|ment of the reader.</P>
<P N="2">2. DOCTOR C. was of the opinion, that 1 Cor. XV. 24&mdash;29, teaches, that before the fini&s;hing of the media|torial &s;cheme, the <HI>&s;econd death</HI> will be de&s;troyed.&mdash;He &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 210.</NOTE>

<Q>Is<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 215.</NOTE> death, the &s;econd death, an enemy? Then this ene|my &s;hall be de&s;troyed; for Chri&s;t mu&s;t de&s;troy <HI>all</HI> ene|mies.</Q>
This is the Doctor's argument; in an&s;wer to which two ob&s;ervations may be made&mdash;That the &s;e|cond death is not an enemy, in the &s;en&s;e which the Doc|tor's argument implies&mdash;That if it were in every &s;en&s;e an enemy, it would not follow, that it &s;hall be de&s;troy|ed, i. e. <HI>aboli&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="022478_0236_0FB92F33E3F69E88">THE reader hath &s;een the ob&s;ervations made above, con|cerning &s;in as an enemy and concerning the de&s;truction of &s;in: &s;imilar ob&s;ervations may be made concerning the &s;e|cond death.</P>
<P N="1">(1) THE &s;econd death is not an enemy in the &s;en&s;e which Dr. C's argument implies and requires.&mdash;If the Doctor meant, that the &s;econd death is an enemy to tho&s;e who are the &s;ubjects of it, as it de&s;troys their happine&s;s and prevents their admi&s;&s;ion to a glorious immortality; this is granted. But it is not granted, that therefore it will be de&s;troyed: and for the Doctor to take it for grant|ed, that therefore it will be de&s;troyed, is the &s;ame thing as to take for granted that all mankind will finally be admit|ted to a glorious immortality, which is the grand &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent controver&s;y.&mdash;But if the Doctor meant, that the &s;econd death is an enemy to Chri&s;t, as it prevents the brighte&s;t di&s;play of his glory, the greate&s;t pro&s;perity of his kingdom, and the greate&s;t happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects; in this &s;en&s;e it is denied to be an enemy.&mdash;This is a &s;en&s;e in which the fir&s;t death is an enemy, and notwith&s;tanding what Dr. C. &s;ays, it does not &s;eem
<Q>ea&s;y to make it ap|pear, that the &s;econd death is, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, as truly an enemy.</Q>
The fir&s;t death, while it continues, prevents the brighte&s;t di&s;play of the glory of Chri&s;t, the greate&s;t pro&s;perity of his kingdom, and the greate&s;t hap|pine&s;s of his &s;ubjects: if it &s;hould continue, it would be incon&s;i&s;tent with the promi&s;es of Chri&s;t, with the complete &s;alvation of the elect, and would defeat the go&s;pel. Now to make it appear, that in this &s;en&s;e the &s;econd death is an enemy, it may be pre&s;umed, is not a more ea&s;y talk, than to prove the &s;alvation of all men.&mdash;The &s;econd death is no more an enemy to Chri&s;t, to his kingdom, or to his faithful &s;ubjects, than the execution of &s;ome mo&s;t attro|cious and ungrateful rebels, who&s;e lives cannot be &s;pared con&s;i&s;tently with the glory of their king, the pro&s;perity of his kingdom, or the happine&s;s of his faithful &s;ubjects; is an enemy to the king, to his kingdom, or to his faithful &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>DOCTOR C. further urges, that
<Q>the &s;econd death is the la&s;t enemy, and the only one that is &s;o.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 210.</NOTE> If it be no enemy, it is neither the <HI>la&s;t</HI> nor the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> enemy. Therefore, "it &s;eems" <HI>not</HI>

The fir&s;t death is in the &s;en&s;e before given, the la&s;t enemy; the la&s;t who prevents the complete di&s;play of Chri&s;t's glo|ry, the la&s;t who prevents the perfection of his kingdom, the la&s;t who has power to hurt the &s;aints. After the de|&s;truction of this death, they immediately receive the adop|tion of &s;ons. Although the devils and tho&s;e who have been per&s;ecutors in this world, will &s;till be in exi&s;tence af|ter the de&s;truction of the fir&s;t death, they will no more have it in their power to di&s;honour Chri&s;t, or to interrupt the happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects, than if they were annihilated.</P>
<P N="2">(2) IF the &s;econd death were in every &s;en&s;e an enemy, it would not follow, that it &s;hall be <HI>de&s;troyed,</HI> meaning <HI>abo|li&s;hed.</HI> All the enemies of God or of Chri&s;t, are no where &s;aid to be <HI>aboli&s;hed</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, meaning <HI>annihilation.</HI> To be <HI>&s;ubdued, &s;ubjected, put under feet,</HI> is by no means the &s;ame as to be <HI>annihilated.</HI> If therefore the &s;econd death be ever &s;o truly and properly an enemy, the utmo&s;t that would thence follow, is, that it would be &s;o re&s;trained and &s;ubjected to Chri&s;t, as to be prevented from doing mi&s;chief, and to be made an in&s;trument of promoting the glory of God, and the happine&s;s of his kingdom. In this &s;en&s;e it may be granted, that the &s;econd death will be de&s;troyed; yet the &s;alvation of all men would no more be implied in the conce&s;&s;ion, than it is implied in the de&s;truction of the devil, mentioned, Heb. II. 14, that he will be annihila|ted. Nor can we hold, that all Chri&s;t's enemies will be <HI>de&s;troyed</HI> in the &s;en&s;e now oppo&s;ed, without holding the annihilation of the wicked, and giving up univer&s;al &s;al|vation.</P>
<P>DR. C. endeavours to make out, that if death, the la&s;t enemy, do mean temporal death, &s;till the de&s;truction of this death implies univer&s;al &s;alvation.
<Q>Simple re&s;toration to life, &s;ays he,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 211, &amp;c.</NOTE>
is not the thing the &s;cripture means by death de&s;troyed. To be &s;ure the apo&s;tle Paul had quite another notion of it.&mdash;What is the idea he leads us to entertain of it? Plainly not a bare return to life, but &s;uch an one as is connected with a glorious immor|tality.</Q>
That in this chapter the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of &s;uch a return to life, as is connected with a glorious immortality, is granted; becau&s;e in this chapter he is &s;peaking of the
<PB N="233" REF="022478_0238_0FB92F3731622E70">
re&s;urrection of the &s;aints only. The Doctor indeed tells us, that it was <HI>with him</HI>
<Q>beyond all controver&s;y evident, that the apo&s;tle is &s;peaking here, not of a partial, but univer&s;al re&s;urrection.</Q>
To others however it is be|yond all controver&s;y evident, that the apo&s;tle is &s;peaking here of the re&s;urrection of the righteous only. Even the Doctor acknowledges, that after the 28th ver&s;e the apo&s;|tle
<Q>confines his di&s;cour&s;e to the righteous, without &s;ay|ing any thing of the wicked.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 207.</NOTE></Q>
Now this affords &s;ome ground of pre&s;umption at lea&s;t, that in the former part of the chapter too, he confines his di&s;cour&s;e to the re&s;urrec|tion of the righteous. Nor has Dr. C. given any rea&s;on, be&s;ide that which has been already examined, viz.

So that Dr. C's argument,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 211.</NOTE> that from the re&s;urrection of all mankind, it follows, that all will be &s;aved, depends on principles, which are neither granted nor proved, and therefore is utterly inconclu&s;ive.</P>

<Q>This <HI>&s;econd</HI> death, &s;trictly and pro|perly &s;peaking, is THE LAST ENEMY, and THE ONLY ONE, that is &s;o.</Q>
Then &s;urely there will not be a <HI>third,</HI> a <HI>fourth</HI> death, &amp;c, &amp;c, for ages of ages. Yet this is taught in other parts of his book; as in the following pa&s;&s;age, <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">P. 309, 310.</NOTE>
<Q>They may all&mdash;be doomed&mdash;to a &s;tate of mi|&s;ery, which &s;hall la&s;t for an age: In which &s;tate <HI>&s;ome</HI> &mdash;may be wrought upon to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to God &mdash;Others may <HI>die</HI> in this &s;tate &s;tupid&mdash;And tho&s;e who thus died in their ob&s;tinacy may again&mdash;be put into a place of &s;uffering for another age; in which <HI>&s;ome</HI> may be reduced&mdash;and others &s;tand it out &s;till.

Here the Doctor di&s;tinctly mentions three future &s;tates of &s;uffering, and &s;uppo&s;es there may be others continued in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion for ages of ages, which are &s;o many di&s;tinct deaths, as really as the fir&s;t &s;tate of &s;uffering after this life, is the &s;e|cond death, with re&s;pect to temporal death.

he &s;ay, that the <HI>&s;econd death</HI> is the <HI>la&s;t</HI> enemy, and the <HI>on|ly one</HI> that is &s;o?</P>
<P N="2">II. THE other argument of Dr. C. is, that the reward of the good and faithful &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t is to be be&s;tow|ed on them in the kingdom of Chri&s;t; and therefore Chri&s;t's kingdom will not be at an end, till after they &s;hall have en|joyed that reward for &s;ome time at lea&s;t; and therefore will not be at an end, at the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t, or immediately after the general judgment."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 222, 223.</NOTE>&mdash;This argu|ment wholly depends on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that at the time at which the work of &s;alvation &s;hall be completed by Chri&s;t he will entirely abdicate all government of &s;uperintenden|cy over tho&s;e who &s;hall be &s;aved by him. If otherwi&s;e; if he &s;hall &s;till retain a &s;uperintendency over tho&s;e who &s;hall be &s;aved by him; if he &s;hall &s;till be their immediate head or ruler, and the &s;ource of their happine&s;s; though he &s;hall not be the &s;upreme ruler of the univer&s;e, nor even of the redeemed; but in this re&s;pect he &s;hall re&s;ign the kingdom to the Father: he may be &s;aid yet to have a king|dom, and to &s;it on his throne; and to reign, &amp;c. Before the re&s;ignation of the mediatorial kingdom, the govern|ment of <HI>all things</HI> is in the hands of Chri&s;t, being delega|ted by the Father to this government. Or as Dr. C. ex|pre&s;&s;es it,
<Q>he will be head over all; he will govern all; he will be all unto all.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 217.</NOTE> Chri&s;t during that period acts as the &s;upreme head of the univer&s;e. But when he &s;hall have re&s;igned the mediatorial kingdom, the Father will act as &s;upreme head. Still Chri&s;t may, under the Father, be the head and governor of his redeemed and &s;aved peo|ple. The Father will be &s;upreme ruler, and Chri&s;t with his Church united to him, and dependent on him, will re|ceive the benefits of his government. This does not im|ply, but that Chri&s;t him&s;elf, in &s;ubordination to the Fa|ther, will have a government over his &s;aints.</P>
<P>NOR does it imply, but that the &s;on as one with the Fa|ther, as being in the Father, and the Father in him, &s;hall reign after the re&s;ignation of the delegated &s;overeignty o|ver all things. It may be pre&s;umed, that no man will &s;ay, that the Father does not reign now while the admini&s;tra|tion of univer&s;al government is in the hands of the Son. If he did not now reign, there would be no propriety in &s;peaking as the &s;cripture often does,
<Q>of him that &s;itteth
<PB N="235" REF="022478_0240_0FB92F3EB34F9308">
on the throne, and the Lamb;</Q>
nor any propriety in the promi&s;e, Joh. XV. 16;
<Q>That what&s;oever ye &s;hall a&s;k of the <HI>Father</HI> in my name, he may give it you;</Q>
nor in tho&s;e words of James, Chap. I. 17;
<Q>Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the <HI>Father</HI> of lights.</Q>
But I need not add texts, to prove this.&mdash;For the &s;ame rea&s;on therefore that the Father now reigns in and with the Son; &s;o after the re&s;ignation of the general delegated admini&s;tration, the Son will &s;till reign in and with the Father. Now the go|vernment is conducted in the name and by the immediate agency of the Son: then it will be conducted in the name and by the immediate agency of the Father. Yet as now the Father reigns in and with the Son; &s;o then will the Son reign in and with the Father. Chri&s;t now reigns with &s;upreme &s;overeignty by delegation from the Father. Af|ter the re&s;ignation of this &s;overeignty, he will &s;till reign over the &s;aints by delegation from the Father, but with dominion, which &s;hall be &s;ubordinate to that of the Father. He will al&s;o at the &s;ame time reign in and with the Father, in the exerci&s;e of a dominion, which &s;hall not be delegated, but which is e&s;&s;ential to him as a divine per&s;on, and one with the Father; as the Father, by virtue of his divinity, now nece&s;&s;arily reigns in and with the Son.&mdash;So that al|though Chri&s;t &s;hall immediately after the general judg|ment, re&s;ign the &s;upreme delegated &s;overeignty, which he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; &s;till he will reign in the&s;e two re&s;pects, by a delegated &s;ubordinate authority over his &s;aints; and by an undelegated, e&s;&s;ential authority, which by virtue of his divinity, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es nece&s;&s;arily with the Father.</P>
<P>BUT whether the true idea of Chri&s;t's delivering up the kingdom to the Father, concerning which Divines have repeatedly differed, have been now preci&s;ely exhibited or not; &s;till the &s;criptures nece&s;&s;itate us to believe, that in &s;ome &s;en&s;e Chri&s;t will reign to an ab&s;olute eternity.

Both the&s;e la&s;t texts are quoted by Dr. C.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 267.</NOTE> to prove that the righteous &s;hall live and be happy without end: and they equally prove that they &s;hall <HI>reign without end.</HI>&mdash;But the &s;aints are to &s;it down with Chri&s;t on his throne and reign with him: and it is ab&s;urd to imagine, that <HI>they</HI> are to reign after the ce&s;&s;ation of his reign; that they are to wear crowns which are incorruptible and fade not away; but that his crown is corruptible and fadeth away. Be&s;ide; the king|dom which the apo&s;tles and primitive chri&s;tians received, ac|cording to Heb. XII. 28, was not the kingdom of the Father, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from that of the Son, but was the kingdom of the Son, which he him&s;elf had then lately &s;et up. <HI>This</HI> kingdom is &s;aid to be incapable of being &s;haken or di&s;&s;olved; and therefore is endle&s;s, as Dr. C. him&s;elf believed: other|wi&s;e it was ab&s;urd for him to quote that text to prove, that the righteous will live and be happy without end.&mdash;Dan. VII. 14. "HIS" [the Son of man's]
<Q>dominion is an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> dominion, which <HI>&s;hall not pa&s;s away,</HI> and his kingdom that which <HI>&s;hall not be de&s;troyed.</HI></Q>

Luke I. 33;
<Q>He &s;hall reign over the hou&s;e of Jacob <HI>forever,</HI> and of his kingdom there <HI>&s;hall be no end.</HI></Q>
&mdash;More determinate language could not be u&s;ed, to expre&s;s the endle&s;s continuance of Chri&s;t's kingdom.</P>
<P>IT is therefore granted, that the kingdom of Chri&s;t will continue, after the general judgment, and even without end. Yet it does not thence follow, that he will not at that time have fini&s;hed the mediatorial work, or rather the work of &s;aving &s;inners. I make this di&s;tinction, becau&s;e though Chri&s;t will at the general judgment, have fini&s;hed the work of &s;aving &s;inners from wrath; yet he will with|out end be the mediator between the Father and the &s;aints, and will be the medium of all divine communications to them, whether of knowledge, of happine&s;s or of honour. It by no means follows from the circum&s;tance, that Chri&s;t will, after the general judgment, retain a kingly power and dominion, that he will exert that power in delivering &s;inners from &s;in and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>THE whole of Dr. C's di&s;cour&s;e on this &s;ubject implies, that the kingdom of the Father, in which he &s;hall be all in all, will not begin immediately after the general judgment. But how can this be reconciled with Matt. XIII. 40&mdash;44;
<Q><PB N="237" REF="022478_0242_0FB92F42B437A148">As therefore the tares are gathered and burnt in the fire; &s;o &s;hall it be <HI>in the end of this world.</HI> The Son of Man &s;hall &s;end forth his angels, and they &s;hall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them that do ini|quity; and &s;hall ca&s;t them into a furnace of fire; there &s;hall be wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth. <HI>Then,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>at that very time,</HI> &s;hall the righteous &s;hine forth as the &s;un <HI>in the kingdom of their</HI> FATHER.</Q>
This &s;ingle text proves that the kingdom becomes the Father's immediately after the end of this world, and therefore entirely overthrows all Dr. C's labour to prove, that the kingdom does not become the Father's till ages of ages after the end of this world; and equally overthrows his great labour to fix a con&s;truction on 1 Cor.

which is and can be no other than the end of Chri&s;t's mediatorial kingdom. According to Dr. C. therefore, the apo&s;tle, under the in&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t, gravely tells us, that the end of Chri&s;t's kingdom will be, when he &s;hall deliver up his kingdom to the Fa|ther: or the end of it &s;hall be at the very time, at which the end of it &s;hall be! But what is this, but the mo&s;t childi&s;h tautology! Who ever imagined, that Chri&s;t would &s;till retain his kingdom, after he &s;hould have delivered it up? Surely that &s;cheme mu&s;t be in di&s;tre&s;s indeed, which requires &s;uch con&s;truction as this to be put on the &s;acred &s;cripture!</P>
<P>DOCTOR C. &s;ays,

<Q>What a poor, low, lean idea the common explanation of this text gives us of the final effects of Chri&s;t's reign&mdash;in compari&s;on with that, the above interpretation lets us into!</Q>
Such excla|mations occur in almo&s;t every argument of his book. I ob&s;erve therefore concerning them once for all, that they &s;eem better &s;uited to work on the pa&s;&s;ions and imagination, than on the rea&s;on; that at lea&s;t they are attempts to de|termine what is mo&s;t for the general good and the glory of the Deity, not from revelation or from fact; but <HI>a priori,</HI> by our own imagination concerning what is be&s;t and mo&s;t eligible. Now that we are in this way utterly incapable of determining what is mo&s;t eligible, and mo&s;t for the divine glory, in a thou&s;and in&s;tances; every man of reflection mu&s;t grant.</P>
<P>I HAVE now fini&s;hed my remarks on Dr. C's "deci&s;ive" argument from 1 Cor. XV. 24, &amp;c. Whether it be in|deed "deci&s;ive;" whether it be "unan&s;werably &s;tong,"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 211.</NOTE> is &s;ubmitted to the reader.</P>
<P>WE are next to con&s;ider the Doctor's argument from Rev. V. 13;
<Q>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ea, and all that are in them, heard I, &s;aying, Ble&s;&s;ing and honour, and glory and power be unto him, that &s;itteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for|ever and ever.</Q>
&mdash;The main que&s;tion concerning the&s;e words is, whether they
<Q>look forward to a completion of the &s;cheme of God,</Q>
and a&s;&s;ert a fact which is not to take place, till that &s;cheme &s;hall be completed. This is Dr. C's idea: he &s;ays, they
<Q>they evidently look for|ward to the completion of that &s;cheme;</Q>
he &s;ays it merely; he gives no rea&s;on to <HI>prove</HI> it. The context gives no &s;ugge&s;tions of &s;uch an idea. It may be pre&s;umed, that Dr. C. him&s;elf did not imagine, that the &s;ong of the four bea&s;ts and four and twenty elders, contained in ver&s;e 9th, &amp;c. looked forward to the completion of the &s;cheme of God. It was evidently &s;ung on occa&s;ion of the Lamb's taking the book &s;ealed with &s;even &s;eals, and before any of the&s;e &s;eals were opened. Nor is there the lea&s;t hint, but that what is de&s;cribed in the 13th ver&s;e, took place
<PB N="239" REF="022478_0244_0FB92F4645B9F910">
on the &s;ame occa&s;ion: but the narration naturally implies that it did then take place. The 14th ver&s;e confirms the con&s;truction now given.
<Q>And the four bea&s;ts &s;aid, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and wor&s;hipped him that liveth forever and ever.</Q>
The&s;e words are evidently a part of the &s;ong mentioned in the 9th ver&s;e, as it was &s;ung by the &s;ame four bea&s;ts and four and twenty elders. Whereas according to Dr. C's con&s;truction of the 13th ver&s;e, they are either a &s;ong which is to be &s;ung after the completion of the &s;cheme of God; or though they are a part of the &s;ong mentioned in the 9th ver&s;e, the apo&s;tle's account of that &s;ong is inter|rupted by in&s;erting in the mid&s;t of it, a &s;ong to be &s;ung by all mankind, after the completion of the &s;cheme of God. &mdash;To a&s;&s;ert therefore, that the fact of the 13th ver&s;e did not take place on the occa&s;ion of the lamb's taking the book; but is to take place ages of ages after the end of this world; and to &s;upport this a&s;&s;ertion by no proof or rea|&s;on, is to act an unrea&s;onable part: e&s;pecially con&s;idering the context and the difficulties attending that con&s;truction.</P>
<P>THESE words appear to contain a figurative repre&s;enta|tion of all creatures joining in joy and prai&s;e to the Father and the lamb on occa&s;ion of Chri&s;t's taking and being about to open the &s;eals of the book &s;ealed with the &s;even &s;eals; the book of providence toward the church. That &s;uch re|pre&s;entations are common in &s;cripture, we have already &s;een, while we were con&s;idering Rom. VIII, 19, &amp;c. Therefore no argument in favor of univer&s;al &s;alvation is afforded by this pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>DR. C. mentions &s;everal other texts as favouring his &s;cheme; but &s;ays him&s;elf, that he does not
<Q>depend on them as proofs,</Q>
or as "conclu&s;ive in them&s;elves." We need not therefore &s;pend time to remark upon them. The reader of him&s;elf will ea&s;ily conceive from the an&s;wers given to tho&s;e on which he does depend as conclu&s;ive, what an&s;wers would be given to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>TOWARD the clo&s;e of that part of his book, which con|tains the direct evidence of univer&s;al &s;alvation, Dr. C. comes down wonderfully, &s;eems to relent, and to be &s;ca|red at the re&s;ult of his own rea&s;oning. He owns, that af|ter all, he may be mi&s;taken; that concerning the &s;tate which he &s;uppo&s;es will &s;ucceed the next &s;tate, neither the prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, nor the apo&s;tles, have &s;poken in

How the&s;e things can be reconciled with
<PB N="242" REF="022478_0247_0FB92F4F77AA6D60">
the Doctor's avowed principles of liberty and moral agen|cy, is hard to be conceived.</P>
<P>NOR was it through inattention, that the Doctor held an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e certainly operating on the minds of men. It is a doctrine e&s;&s;ential and important in his &s;cheme, that all the damned will be finally and certainly brought to re|pentance, and brought to repentance by the torments of hell too. Are not tho&s;e torments a cau&s;e extrin&s;ic to the human will? If that cau&s;e be certainly effectual to lead the damned to repentance, what, on the Doctor's plan, becomes of their moral agency? If that cau&s;e be not certainly ef|fectual to lead them all to repentance; it is not certain that all men will be &s;aved&mdash;So that on the plan of the Doc|tor's book, either his grand doctrine of the final certain &s;alvation of all men, by a di&s;ciplinary puni&s;hment, mu&s;t be given up, or it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, that all who are in that way &s;aved, are dive&s;ted of their moral agency and are re|duced to mere machines.</P>
<P>INDEED if the &s;alvation of all men be certain, and it be certain that all men will repent; it is by &s;ome cau&s;e or other <HI>made certain.</HI> That which is now a certain futurity, was a certain futurity from the beginning; yea from eter|nity. As it is now a certain futurity, that Chri&s;t will come to judgment, &s;o it was certain from the beginning. There|fore if it be now a certain futurity, that all men will re|pent and be &s;aved, it was a certain futurity from the be|ginning; and that certainty was e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;ome cau&s;e: and that cau&s;e mu&s;t have been extrin&s;ic to the wills of men; becau&s;e both the certainty and the cau&s;e of it ex|i&s;ted before the exi&s;tence of men or their wills.&mdash;So that if it be a real and certain truth, that all men will be &s;aved, to prove which, Dr. C. wrote his whole book, it is equal|ly certain on his plan, that all men are dive&s;ted of their moral agency.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be &s;till pleaded, that this certainty of the &s;al|vation of all men, is not effected by any cau&s;e extrin&s;ic to the wills of tho&s;e, who are to be &s;aved, but by their wills them&s;elves; the ab&s;urdity of this &s;uppo&s;ition mu&s;t be gla|ring to every man on the &s;lighte&s;t reflection. A great part of tho&s;e who are to be &s;aved, are not as yet in exi&s;tence: and it will not be pretended that their wills can have pro|duced an effect, or e&s;tabli&s;hed a certainty, before they exi&s;t. And doubtle&s;s Dr. C. and other univer&s;ali&s;ts would
<PB N="243" REF="022478_0248_0FB92F5100C76EB0">
allow, that the &s;alvation of tho&s;e who are in exi&s;tence, was as certain before their exi&s;tence, as the &s;alvation of tho&s;e is, who are in future to come into exi&s;tence. But that certainty could not, for the rea&s;on already mentioned, be the effect of any exertion of their own wills.</P>
<P>BESIDE; if it were not for this ab&s;urdity, a certainty e&s;tabli&s;hed by the will of man with re&s;pect to the will it|&s;elf, as effectually binds that will, and is equally incon&s;i&s;t|ent with its liberty, as if that certainty were e&s;tabli&s;hed by any other cau&s;e. Suppo&s;e the will of any man &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h in it&s;elf a <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>unfailing</HI> bias to any particu|lar action or &s;eries of actions; it cannot be pretended that this fixed bias already e&s;tabli&s;hed, is any more con&s;i&s;tent with liberty and moral agency, in the man in whom the bias exi&s;ts, than if it had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by any other cau&s;e. If a man were to cut off his own leg, though he might be more blamable for the act of cutting it off, than he would be for the &s;ame act performed by another; yet the effect, as to his &s;ub&s;equent inability to walk, would be the very &s;ame.</P>
<P>THEREFORE whatever be the cau&s;e of the certainty and fixed futurity of the repentance and &s;alvation of all men; the doctrine of the certain &s;alvation of all men, is on Dr. C's plan of liberty, wholly incon&s;i&s;tent with human liber|ty, and implies that all men are, and ever have been, mere machines.</P>
<P>IN vain does Dr. C. endeavour to relieve this difficulty, by ob&s;erving in various pa&s;&s;ages, as in one of the quota|tions above, That this repentance is brought about
<Q>in a moral way, &s;uch an one as is adju&s;ted to moral agents.</Q>
For he has told us that &s;uch exertions of the Deity, as &s;hall be <HI>certainly effectual</HI> to re&s;train free agents from per|verting their faculties, and &s;uch an influence of any ex|trin&s;ic power, motives or whatever, as &s;hall&punc; unavoidably put their faculties into exerci&s;e in one way only, are not adju&s;ted to moral agents; but are incon&s;i&s;tent with their proper powers. Therefore, according to the Doctor, it is not in the power of the Deity him&s;elf, certainly and in|fallibly to lead all men, in a moral way, to repentance. It is a direct contradiction. And though he ob&s;erves,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 167.</NOTE> That that being who is infinitely perfect will be able, in a moral way, finally to counteract human ob&s;tinacy; he is utterly
<PB N="244" REF="022478_0249_0FB92F52ADDA9620">
mi&s;taken, if there be any truth in his idea of liberty. If God were to overcome human ob&s;tinacy, an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e would effectually and certainly incline the human faculties to an exerci&s;e in one way; winch the Doctor &s;ays is incon|&s;i&s;tent with moral agency.</P>
<P>THE Doctor tells us,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 344, 345.</NOTE> that to
<Q>repre&s;ent hell to the view of &s;inners in &s;uch a &s;triking light, as that they &s;hould be irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;topped in their wicked pur&s;uits, would not comport with their free agency.</Q>
Yet he &s;uppo&s;es, that to be in hell, and to feel its torments &s;o &s;trikingly as to be <HI>certainly and infallibly</HI> &s;topped in wicked pur&s;uits, and thus to be brought to repentance, is to be brought to re|pentance in a moral way, entirely comporting with free agency.</P>
<P>UPON Dr. C's plan of liberty, there not only is not, and cannot be, any certainty, that <HI>all</HI> men will be &s;aved; but there is not, and cannot be, any certainty that <HI>any one</HI> man will be &s;aved. The Divine Being him&s;elf cannot make it certain, without de&s;troying moral agency. Not any of the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel give us a&s;&s;urance of the &s;alvation of any man: nor is it in the power of God to give a promi&s;e of &s;alvation which &s;hall in&s;ure the event, &s;o long as men remain moral agents. Therefore it was to no purpo&s;e that Dr. C. quoted &s;o many promi&s;es and &s;crip|tural declarations to prove the &s;alvation of all men.</P>
<P>ON the &s;ame hypothe&s;is concerning liberty, even though all men were delivered from hell and admitted to heaven, there would be no certainty that they would continue there. They would be con&s;tantly liable to &s;in anew, and bring on them&s;elves a &s;econd damnation. To deny this, would be, to allow that their faculties might con&s;i&s;tently with moral agency, be <HI>certainly</HI> and <HI>fixedly</HI> inclined to "exerci&s;e them&s;elves in one way only."</P>
<P>THAT the inhabitants of heaven are liable to &s;in and damnation, is actually allowed by hone&s;t Bi&s;hop Newton.
<Q>This life is indeed a &s;tate of trial,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Newton's works, vol. VI. p. <HI>361.</HI></NOTE> but not a trial to fix our fate forever, without any po&s;&s;ibility of changing for better or for wor&s;e, in the world to come. For if the righteous can be but righteous, and the wicked can be but wicked, and cannot act otherwi&s;e; there is an utter end of all freedom of will and morality of action.

<Q>The &s;cripture <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 362.</NOTE>a&s;&s;ures us, that in the next life men will be made (Luke XX. 36.) equal unto the angels; but angels, we know, have apo&s;tatized and and fallen; and why may not men, even when made equal unto the angels?&mdash;If righteou&s;ne&s;s <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 360.</NOTE> &s;hould degenerate and become wickedne&s;s; or if wickedne&s;s &s;hould amend and become righteou&s;ne&s;s; the tables would then be turned, and with the change of their nature, their &s;tate and condition would be changed too.</Q>
How then is it certain that all men will be finally holy and happy? It neither is, nor can po&s;&s;ibly be certain; be|cau&s;e certainty in this ca&s;e would imply that
<Q>the righteous can be but righteous;</Q>
and &s;o
<Q>there would be an utter end of all freedom of will and morality of action.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT then becomes of the boa&s;ted evidence of the final &s;alvation of all men? There is no certain evidence of it.

<P>FROM the &s;ame hypothe&s;is it follows that God him&s;elf does not and cannot po&s;&s;ibly govern mankind with certain|ty; that there is no foundation to pray for any event which depends on the volitions of our own minds, or tho&s;e of other men; that there is no ground for confidence in the divine providence; and that it is impo&s;&s;ible that any future free actions of men, or any events depending on tho&s;e actions, &s;hould be certainly foretold, or even fore|known by God him&s;elf; becau&s;e what is ab&s;olutely un|certain, cannot be certainly known, and what is certainly known is certainly fixed and determined.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> A reply to Dr. C's an&s;wers to the arguments in favour of endle&s;s puni&s;hment, drawn from tho&s;e texts, which declare the puni&s;hment of the damned to be <HI>everla&s;ting, forever, forever and ever,</HI> and the fire of hell to be unquenchable,</HEAD>
<P>DOCTOR C. &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 258.</NOTE> that the mi&s;ery of the damned is &s;aid to be <HI>eternal</HI> or <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> in five texts only in all the New Te&s;tament. Whatever was intended by this ambiguous propo&s;ition, the fact doubtle&s;s is, that many of his readers have been gro&s;&s;ly deceived by it, as they have been led to believe, that the doctrine of endle&s;s puni&s;hment is apparently taught, in no more than five texts in all the New Te&s;tament; or that no more than five texts can be produced, the words of which &s;eem to import an endle&s;s puni&s;hment. Whereas, all that Dr. C. or any man can pretend is, that the puni&s;hment of the damned is in five
<PB N="247" REF="022478_0252_0FB92F59A63F07E8">
texts only, in the New Te&s;tament, a&s;&s;erted to be <HI>eternal,</HI> by the u&s;e of the adjective <GAP DESC="foreign">, commonly tran&s;lated <HI>eternal</HI> or <HI>everla&s;ting.</HI> It cannot be pretended, but that the texts in which the puni&s;hment of the damned is in &s;ome manner or other declared to be eternal, and in words as determinate, as the adjective, <GAP DESC="foreign">, eternal, far exceed the number <HI>five.</HI> The five texts now referred to, do not compri&s;e any of tho&s;e, in which the damned are &s;aid to be puni&s;hed forever, forever and ever; to be puni&s;hed by a worm that dieth not, and a fire that is not quenched; to be confined by an impa&s;&s;able gulf; to be &s;hut out from the kingdom of heaven; not to &s;ee life, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>NOW what follows from this circum&s;tance, that the pu|ni&s;hment of the damned is in five texts only, in the New-Te&s;tament, declared to be eternal, by the application of the Greek adjective, <GAP DESC="foreign">? It may &s;till be declared to be eternal, by other words equally determinate, in above five hundred texts.</P>
<P>OR if there were no other texts, expre&s;&s;ing in other words, endle&s;s puni&s;hment; are not five divine a&s;&s;evera|tions of any truth, &s;ufficient to bind our faith? If five be not &s;ufficient for this end, neither are five thou&s;and.</P>
<P>BESIDES; all that Dr C. &s;ays on this head, may be ju&s;tly retorted: and if his ob&s;ervations in page 259, 260, be of any force to &s;how, that the doctrine of endle&s;s pu|ni&s;hment is not caught in the &s;criptures; ju&s;t as forcibly may it be proved, that the damned will not be puni&s;hed for an age. Suppo&s;ing, as Dr. C. does, that the words <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. do not mean an endle&s;s duration, but the duration of <HI>an age</HI>; I might &s;ay,
<Q>The mi&s;ery of the wicked is &s;aid to be <HI>for an age,</HI> in only five texts, in all in all the New Te&s;tament: Upon which I cannot help making a pau&s;e to expre&s;s my &s;urprize to find the &s;acred writers &s;o very &s;paring in the u&s;e of this word <HI>age,</HI> as referring to future torments. It is u&s;ed but three times by Matthew; but once by Mark; but once by Paul; and not once by the other writers of the New Te&s;ta|ment. All which is very extraordinary, if it be a doc|trine of Chri&s;tianity, that the wicked are to be puni&s;hed <HI>for an age.</HI>&mdash;And the omi&s;&s;ions of the &s;acred writers upon this head, are a &s;trong pre&s;umptive argument, that they know nothing of this doctrine, which has been &s;o vehemently pleaded for in the&s;e latter days,</Q>

C. and &s;ome others. Therefore, whenever it &s;hall be proved, that notwith&s;tanding the rare u&s;e of the word <HI>age,</HI> with a reference to the puni&s;hment of the wicked, that puni&s;hment will really la&s;t <HI>for an age;</HI> it is pre&s;umed, that it can be proved from the &s;ame topics, that it will la&s;t <HI>with|out end.</HI>&mdash;If a word, &s;ignifying an age, applied five times to future puni&s;hment, prove that puni&s;hment to con|tinue for an age; why will not a word &s;ignifying an end|le&s;s duration, applied five times to that puni&s;hment, prove it to be without end? Nothing therefore can be concluded from the number of times, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>eternal,</HI> is applied to future puni&s;hment.

It is acknow|ledged, that if tho&s;e words <HI>may</HI> &s;ignify, and all things con|&s;idered, do <HI>as probably</HI> &s;ignify, a limited, as an unlimited duration, when applied to the puni&s;hment of the wicked; nothing either for or again&s;t endle&s;s puni&s;hment, can be concluded from the u&s;e of tho&s;e words. It is al&s;o, on the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;itions, acknowledged, that by that application of tho&s;e words, the evidence which Dr. C. has exhibited in favour of the &s;alvation of all men, is not at all impaired. But it is not granted, that tho&s;e words, when applied to the puni&s;hment of the wicked, do as probably &s;ignify a limited as unlimited duration. Nor is it granted that Dr. C's evidence of univer&s;al &s;alvation is valid. Though we &s;hould grant that it remains unimpaired by the words <GAP DESC="foreign">

<Q>If <GAP DESC="foreign">

<Q>that there is not the &s;hadow of an interference between the connection of <GAP DESC="foreign">, eternal,</Q>
with the life and happine&s;s of the righteous, and their final damna|tion.</P>
<P>THE Doctor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 261.</NOTE> &s;ays,
<Q>The&s;e words, <GAP DESC="foreign">
and <GAP DESC="foreign">
are evidently more loo&s;e and general in their meaning, than the Engli&s;h words <HI>eternity, everla&s;ting</HI>&mdash;If it were not &s;o, how comes it to pa&s;s, that <GAP DESC="foreign">
and <GAP DESC="foreign">
will not always bear being tran&s;lated eternity, everla&s;ting?</Q>
By the &s;ame argument it may be proved, that the words <HI>eternity</HI> and <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> in our language, are more loo&s;e and gene|ral in their meaning, than the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign">
and <GAP DESC="foreign">. We frequently &s;ay, &s;uch a man is an everla&s;ting talker, or he talks eternally; he is eternally &s;landering and quarrelling with his neighbours. But according to Dr. C's &s;en&s;e of the Greek words <GAP DESC="foreign">
and <GAP DESC="foreign">, the Engli&s;h phra&s;es ju&s;t mentioned cannot be properly tran&s;lated, by the u&s;e of tho&s;e Greek words. The Doctor &s;ays, they properly mean the duration of an age. But when it is &s;aid, a man talks eternally, the meaning is not, that he talks <HI>for an age.</HI>&mdash;The truth is, there are idioms in all languages, which will not bear a literal tran&s;lation into any other language.&mdash;The circum&s;tance that <GAP DESC="foreign">, will not always bear to be rendered <HI>eternity</HI> and <HI>eternal,</HI> no more proves, that they do not properly &s;ignify the &s;ame with our words <HI>eternity</HI> and <HI>eternal,</HI> than the circum&s;tance that they will not always bear to be rendered <HI>an age,</HI> and <HI>during an age,</HI> proves that they do not properly &s;ignify the duration of an age. It is &s;aid, Rom. XVI. 26.
<Q>Ac|cording to the commandment of the <HI>everla&s;ting God,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">;</Q>
but no man would render this, according to the commandment of the God <HI>who lives for an age.</HI></P>
<P>THE Doctor thinks that
<Q>before <HI>eternal times</HI> is an impro|priety in Engli&s;h,</Q>
and hence infers, that <GAP DESC="foreign">
Tit. I. 2, means a limited duration. It is pre&s;umed, that the Doctor would not have objected to the propriety of expre&s;&s;ing a proper eternity, by &s;aying, <HI>From eternity, from everla&s;ting, from eternal ages.</HI> Yet in reality there
<PB N="250" REF="022478_0255_0FB92F5E69DD4130">
is as great an impropriety in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, as in that which the Doctor pronounces an impropriety. Under&s;tood &s;trictly and literally they imply, that there is a point at which eternity began, and <HI>from eternity</HI> is from that point. The very u&s;e of the prepo&s;ition <HI>from</HI> implies this. It im|plies, that the computation is made <HI>from</HI> &s;omething, at which eternity began. This &s;omething mu&s;t &s;trictly be &s;ome time, or &s;ome point in endle&s;s duration. So that <HI>from eternity</HI> taken &s;trictly, is as real and as great an im|propriety as <HI>before eternity or before eternal times.</HI> The &s;ame is ob&s;ervable of <HI>to eternity.</HI> Yet <HI>from eternity</HI> and <HI>to eternity,</HI> are in fact u&s;ed among us to expre&s;s an ab&s;o|lute eternity: and how does it appear ab&s;urd, that the apo&s;tle &s;hould expre&s;s the &s;ame idea by a phra&s;e, in which no greater impropriety is naturally implied, and which may as well, and in the &s;ame way, as the phra&s;es <HI>from eternity</HI> and <HI>to eternity,</HI> be made properly to &s;ignify an ab&s;olute e|ternity?

while I de&s;cend to the con&s;ideration of the particular texts, in which it occurs. In forty-four of the forementioned &s;ixty-&s;ix texts, <GAP DESC="foreign">
is applied to the future life of the righteous, and therefore is u&s;ed in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e. If this be not allowed, it will follow, that there is no pro|mi&s;e, no &s;ecurity of an endle&s;s life to the righteous, or to any of mankind, and of cour&s;e univer&s;al &s;alvation mu&s;t be given up; as &s;hall be more particularly &s;hown pre&s;ently. In Luke XVI. 9, it is applied to the cele&s;tial habitations of the righteous: in 2 Cor. IV. 17, to the future glory of the righteous: in 2 Cor. V. 1, to their hou&s;e in hea|ven: in 2 The&s;&s;. II. 16, to their con&s;olation: in 2 Tim. II. 10, to their future glory: in Heb. V. 9. to their &s;al|vation: in Heb. IX. 15, to their future inheritance. That in the&s;e &s;even in&s;tances it is u&s;ed in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e, will doubtle&s;s be granted, by all tho&s;e who allow this to be the &s;en&s;e of it in the preceding forty-four. In Feb.

That in the&s;e three in&s;tances, it is u&s;ed in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e, it is pre&s;umed, there can be no di&s;pute among Chri&s;tians. The &s;en&s;e is &s;till more determinate, when it is applied to the Deity or his perfections, as it is to God him&s;elf, in Rom. XVI. 9: to the divine power, in 2 Tim.

V. 10: to the Holy Gho&s;t, in Heb. <HI>IX.</HI> 14&mdash;In 2 Cor. <HI>IV.</HI> 18, it is applied to things un&s;een, as oppo&s;ed to things &s;een: and to &s;uppo&s;e, that in this in&s;tance it means the duration of an age or di&s;pen&s;ation only, would de&s;troy all oppo&s;ition between things &s;een and things un&s;een; becau&s;e many of the former continue for an nge or di&s;pen&s;ation, as well as the latter.

the laws of nature nece&s;&s;arily in time come to an end&mdash; That fire powerfully tends to bring on a di&s;&s;olution of tho&s;e bodies that are ca&s;t into it.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT the word <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> is applied, in two texts, to the <HI>fire,</HI> not to the <HI>puni&s;hment,</HI> of hell; hence the Doc|tor infers, in words which he quotes with approbation from <HI>Nichol Scot,</HI> that though

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 272.</NOTE> Did the Doctor then believe, that &s;ome of the &s;ubjects of hell-fire will not exi&s;t without end, but will be annihilated? This is to give up the &s;alvation of all men.&mdash;Be&s;ides; that the fire of hell will be kept up without end, and therefore eternal ages after all the &s;ubjects &s;hall be either annihilated or de|livered out of it, is a mere conjecture, un&s;upported by any evidence from &s;cripture or rea&s;on. As well might the Doctor have &s;aid, The &s;aints will indeed be received to everla&s;ting habitations; the <HI>habitations</HI> will be &s;trictly with|out end; but the <HI>&s;aints</HI> will, after a while, be all either annihilated or &s;ent to hell.&mdash;What if the word everla&s;ting be in <HI>two</HI> in&s;tances applied to the <HI>fire</HI> of hell?

<Q>&s;hall be <HI>tormented,</HI> day and night, forever and ever.</Q>
And if, when applied to the <HI>fire,</HI> it prove that to be without end, doubtle&s;s when applied to the <HI>puni&s;hment,</HI> to the <HI>de&s;truction,</HI> to the <HI>torment,</HI> it e|qually proves them to be without end.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT
<Q>fire as &s;uch naturally tends to an end, and will, in time,</Q>
by the laws of nature,
<Q>actually come to an end.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 273.</NOTE>&mdash;This, like many other of Dr. C's argu|ments, if it prove any thing, proves too much, and there|fore really proves nothing. It depends on this very fal&s;e principle&punc; that whatever, according to the laws of nature, e&s;tabli&s;hed in this world, would, without an immediate di|vine interpo&s;ition, come to an end, will certainly come to an end in the future world. Now according to this prin|ciple, all the bodies of both &s;inners and &s;aints, in the fu|ture world, as well as this, will be di&s;&s;olved. Nay, as their &s;ouls too are con&s;tantly upholden in exi&s;tence by the agency of God, and would in their own nature immedi|ately cea&s;e to exi&s;t, were it not for that continued agency;
<PB N="257" REF="022478_0262_0FB92F7073DA5290">
it follows, according to the principle now under con&s;ide|ration, that all the &s;ouls of both &s;inners and &s;aints will ac|tually come to an end, in the future world. But as this con&s;equence will be rejected, and as it will be granted, that the &s;ouls of all men will, by the agency of God, be upholden without end; &s;o the &s;ame agency will be &s;uffici|ent, to continue the fire of hell without end; and that whether it be material fire or not. If it be not material fire, it does not, in its own nature, more tend to an end, than the &s;ouls of men, or the faculties of tho&s;e &s;ouls. If it be material fire, &s;till it may, as was ju&s;t now ob&s;erved, be perpetuated to an ab&s;olute eternity.</P>
<P>IF this argument from the tendency of fire to an end, be of any force, it will overthrow Dr. C's &s;cheme, equal|ly as the contrary. For it is equally the tendency of all the fire, of which we have any experience, to come to an end, in a &s;hort time, as to come to an end at all. No fire in this world will, without new &s;upplies of fuel, la&s;t for ages of ages, or even for one age. But with a proper &s;upply of fuel, any fire may be kept up without end. If therefore we are to conclude, that the fire of hell will come to an end, becau&s;e the fire of which we have know|ledge, will without a new and con&s;tant &s;upply of fuel, come to an end; we are al&s;o to conclude, that the fire of hell will come to an end, before the expiration of one age. &mdash;Indeed God can make the fire of hell la&s;t for an age: and he can with equal ea&s;e make it la&s;t without end. Nay, he can make our common fire la&s;t without end. The &s;ame power which &s;hall make our bodies immortal, can make our common fire &s;trictly eternal. To this end the nature of that fire needs no greater alteration, than the nature of our bodies needs, to render them immortal.</P>
<P>THE Doctor informs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 274.</NOTE> us, that he
<Q>&s;ees not but an age, di&s;pen&s;ation or period, for the continuance of this fire, will very well an&s;wer the full import of the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>everla&s;ting</HI>; e&s;pecially, if we &s;uppo&s;e this age to la&s;t till the fire has accompli&s;hed the end, for which it was enkindled.</Q>
&mdash;But it is not allowed by the oppo|nents of the Doctor, that the fire will ever have accom|pli&s;hed the end, for which it was enkindled: and to argue on that &s;uppo&s;ition, is to take for granted, what is as much in di&s;pute, as any &s;ubject of this whole controver&s;y.&mdash;He

According to this then, the word <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> &amp;c, applied to future puni&s;hment, gives no evidence, that that puni&s;hment is to la&s;t longer, than the time, during which the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were in con&s;u|ming, or longer than one day: and the flood of Noah, as it la&s;ted till it had accompli&s;hed the de&s;ign of heaven in the de&s;truction of the old world, for a &s;tanding public ex|ample of the divine vengeance to after ages, was an eter|nal flood: The deaths of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, of Nadab and Abihu, of Zimri and Co&s;bi, &amp;c, &amp;c, were for the &s;ame rea&s;ons <HI>eternal deaths.</HI>&mdash;But how is this &s;en&s;e of everla&s;ting con&s;i&s;tent with that for which Dr. C. abundant|ly contends, that it &s;ignifies the duration of an age?

This argument is ju&s;t as conclu&s;ive, as that now quoted from Dr. C. He who can make an human body endure the fire of hell for an age, can make it endure the &s;ame fire, for an endle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages. Therefore though fire does powerfully tend to bring on a di&s;&s;olution of tho&s;e bodies, which are ca&s;t into it, it by no means thence follows, either that &s;uch di&s;&s;olution will be effected in the wicked; or that their torment will ever come to an end.</P>

in writing this pa&s;&s;age, he &s;eems to have forgotten it; that the death, de&s;truction, corruption, &s;econd death of the damned, is their mi&s;ery or torment, the &s;moke of which &s;hall a&s;cend forever and ever, and in which in Rev.

may be at all to the purpo&s;e, it ought to be &s;hown&mdash; 1. That de&s;truction, death, &amp;c, as applied in &s;cripture to the damned, are incon&s;i&s;tent with their endle&s;s mi&s;ery, and are not at the &s;ame time, equally incon&s;i&s;tent with their final &s;alvation.&mdash;2.

<P>A VIEW has now been taken of Dr. C's arguments to prove, that <GAP DESC="foreign">
<HI>eternity</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>eternal,</HI> do not in the &s;acred writings properly mean an endle&s;s duration. Con|cerning the validity of tho&s;e arguments, it is the province of the reader to judge.</P>
<P>WE are next to attend to the Doctor's an&s;wer to the argument drawn from the circum&s;tance, that the &s;ame word in &s;cripture is u&s;ed to expre&s;s the duration of the mi&s;ery of the wicked, as is u&s;ed to expre&s;s the duration of the hap|pine&s;s of the righteous, and that in the &s;ame text; as Mat. XXV. 46; "The&s;e &s;hall go away into eternal puni&s;hment, but the righteous into eternal life."</P>
<P>THE Doctor's fir&s;t an&s;wer to this argument is, that the &s;tate next &s;ucceeding the pre&s;ent, is not final, either with re&s;pect to the wicked or the righteous: and therefore the word <HI>eternal,</HI> even when applied to the life of the righteous, means not an endle&s;s duration.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 282.</NOTE> For this hypothe&s;is he gives no new rea&s;ons, but refers us to what he had &s;aid be|fore, which we have already con&s;idered,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 234, &amp;c.</NOTE> and the &s;um of which is, that Chri&s;t's kingdom is not to continue without end, but is at la&s;t to be delivered up to the Father; that the reward promi&s;ed in &s;cripture to the righteous is to be be&s;towed upon them in this kingdom of Chri&s;t; that that reward therefore cannot be without end.&mdash;In oppo&s;i|tion to this, it has been &s;hown, that the &s;criptures abun|dantly a&s;&s;ure us, that the kingdom of Chri&s;t is to be without end; and that whatever is &s;aid in &s;cripture concerning Chri&s;t's re&s;ignation of the kingdom to the Father, mu&s;t be under&s;tood in a con&s;i&s;tency with the endle&s;s duration of Chri&s;t's kingdom: and an attempt was made, to &s;how in what &s;en&s;e of re&s;igning the kingdom, a con&s;i&s;tency can be pre&s;erved.</P>

<P>THAT Dr. C. does in other parts of his book, hold that there are promi&s;es of endle&s;s happine&s;s, does not relieve the matter. To be incon&s;i&s;tent and to contradict one's &s;elf, clears up no difficulty. Who is an&s;werable for that incon|&s;i&s;tence,
<PB N="264" REF="022478_0269_0FB92F7E193D8470">
I need not inform the reader. It is manife&s;t, the Doctor was driven into this incon&s;i&s;tence, by the pre&s;&s;ure of the argument from Matt. XXV. 46, That the puni&s;h|ment of the wicked is of the &s;ame duration with the hap|pine&s;s of the righteous, becau&s;e in the very &s;ame &s;entence it is &s;aid, The wicked &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting pu|ni&s;hment, and the righteous into everla&s;ting life.</P>
<P>IF there be no promi&s;e in &s;cripture, of final happine&s;s, then all tho&s;e texts from which the Doctor argues univer|&s;al &s;alvation, are altogether impertinent, and prove no|thing to the purpo&s;e for which they are brought. A pro|mi&s;e is an a&s;&s;urance of the be&s;towment of &s;ome future good. If therefore, Rom. V. 12, &amp;c, Chap. VIII. 19, &amp;c, 1 Cor. XV. 24, &amp;c, &amp;c, be no promi&s;es of endle&s;s happine&s;s, they afford no a&s;&s;urance nor evidence, that all will be finally &s;aved.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame manner in which Dr. C. re&s;tricts Matt. XXV. 46, to a limited duration, may every text from which he argues univer&s;al &s;alvation, be re&s;tricted. If the life promi&s;ed in the la&s;t quoted text, be a limited life; a life to be enjoyed before the kingdom is delivered up to the Father; what rea&s;on can be given why, in Rom. V. 18, "The free gift came upon all men to ju&s;tification of <HI>life,</HI>" the life promi&s;ed is not the &s;ame, and of the &s;ame limited duration?&mdash;If life for a limited duration only be pro|mi&s;ed in Matt. XXV. 46; then the de&s;truction of death for a limited duration only, is of cour&s;e all that is promi&s;ed in the &s;ame text. And if the de&s;truction of death for a li|mited duration only be all that is promi&s;ed in Matt. XXV. 46; how does it appear, that a de&s;truction of death for any more than a limited duration, is promi&s;ed in 1 Cor. XV. 26, "the la&s;t enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed is death?" &mdash;And how &s;trange is it, that Dr. C. &s;hould from Rom. VIII. 21,
<Q>The creature &s;hall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God,</Q>
argue the certain &s;alvation of all men, when he him&s;elf holds, that the glorious liberty promi&s;ed the children of God, does not mean final &s;alva|tion.</P>
<P>THE Doctor's &s;econd an&s;wer to the argument from Matt. XXV. 46, is founded on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the next is the final &s;tate with re&s;pect to both the righteous and the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 282.</NOTE>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 282.</NOTE>
<Q>If&mdash;the wicked are &s;ent to hell as &s;o many ab&s;olute incu|rables, the &s;econd death ought to be con&s;idered as that which will put an end to their exi&s;tence, both in &s;oul and body.</Q>
Thus this &s;econd an&s;wer of Dr. C, whol|ly depends on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the wicked are to be annihilated; and to evade the argument from Mat. XXV. 46, to prove endle&s;s puni&s;hment, he is nece&s;&s;itated to adopt the &s;cheme of annihilation, and thus to give up his whole &s;y&s;tem of univer&s;al &s;alvation.</P>
<P>THE Doctor gives us three rea&s;ons to &s;how, that even on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the next is the final &s;tate, it will not follow, from the endle&s;s happine&s;s of the righteous, that the wicked will &s;uffer endle&s;s mi&s;ery.

And if it be final, the wicked mu&s;t be without end in that &s;tate, which is allowed by all to be a &s;tate of mi&s;ery; or they mu&s;t not exi&s;t at all.&mdash;Thus &s;till the Doctor is obliged to give up his favourite &s;cheme of the &s;alvation of all men.</P>
<P>HIS &s;econd rea&s;on is, that it perfectly falls in with our natural notions of the infinite benevolence of the Deity, that he &s;hould reward the righteous with endle&s;s life; but not that he &s;hould puni&s;h the wicked with endle&s;s mi&s;ery.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 285.</NOTE> But our notions of the benevolence of the Deity, are to be conformed to divine revelation; and only when they are conformed to that &s;tandard, are they right.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 287, 288.</NOTE> Now all tho&s;e his determinate texts have been already con|&s;idered in page 262, &amp;c; and in view of the ob&s;erva|tions there made, the reader will judge, whether tho&s;e texts do any more deci&s;ively, than the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>ever|la&s;ting,</HI> prove the future happine&s;s of the righteous, to be without end.</P>
<P>TO confirm his con&s;truction of Matt. XXV. 46, Dr. C. mentions two texts in which he &s;uppo&s;es the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> is in the &s;ame &s;entence u&s;ed both in the limit|ed and endle&s;s &s;en&s;e. One is Rom. XVI. 25, 26;
<Q>Ac|cording to the my&s;tery which was kept &s;ecret [<GAP DESC="foreign">] <HI>&s;ince the world began</HI>&mdash;but is now made ma|nife&s;t&mdash;according to the commandment [<GAP DESC="foreign">] of the everla&s;ting God.</Q>
Concerning this text it was before ob&s;erved, that <GAP DESC="foreign">
is perfectly ca|pable of the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e. The my&s;tery was kept &s;ecret from all eternity, or during the eternal ages which prece|ded creation; or through the eternity <HI>a parte ante,</HI> as &s;ome call it. So that this text an&s;wers not the Doctor's pur|po&s;e.&mdash;The other text produced by the Doctor, is Tit. I. 2,
<Q>In hope [<GAP DESC="foreign">] of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, promi&s;ed [<GAP DESC="foreign">] before the world began.</Q>
On this text, it has been ob&s;erved,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 249.</NOTE> that there is no ab&s;olute certainty, that it means a limited duration. But &s;uppo&s;ing that this indeed is an in&s;tance to the Doctor's purpo&s;e: when it &s;hall be made as evident from the very nature of the ca&s;e, or from any other &s;ource of evidence, that the wicked cannot be puni&s;hed without end, as it is, that God could not give a promi&s;e before eternity; doubtle&s;s we &s;hall all give up the Doctrine of endle&s;s puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>AT length we come to the Doctor's critici&s;m on the ex|pre&s;&s;ion <HI>forever and ever.</HI>&mdash;He &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e, that

Be this as it may, it equally overthrows the Doctor's &s;cheme, as if it ever &s;o confe&s;&s;edly referred to the puni&s;hment of <HI>all</HI> the wicked.&mdash;But on the &s;up|po&s;ition, that <HI>forever and ever</HI> refers to the puni&s;hment of the wicked in common, the Doctor thinks that that

<P N="1">1. A<GAP DESC="foreign">
in the &s;ingular number almo&s;t perpetually &s;igni|fies a limited duration.&mdash;An&s;wer: It is by no means granted, that <GAP DESC="foreign">
in the &s;ingular almo&s;t perpetually &s;ignifies a limited duration; e&s;pecially when governed by the pre|po&s;ition <GAP DESC="foreign">. In p. 250, &amp;c, the u&s;e of <GAP DESC="foreign">, in the New Te&s;tament, was traced, both in the &s;ingular and plural, and it was found, that it is much more frequently u&s;ed in the endle&s;s, than in the limited &s;en&s;e. If the u&s;e of the &s;ingular number only be traced, in even this number it is &s;till mo&s;t frequently u&s;ed in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e, as the learn|ed reader may &s;ee, by examining the texts, in which it is u&s;ed in the Greek Te&s;tament, all which have been already noted. Dr. C's a&s;&s;ertion therefore, that it almo&s;t per|petually &s;ignifies a limited duration, is a <HI>mere</HI> a&s;&s;ertion, and &s;tands for nothing until it &s;hall be proved: and to make a mere a&s;&s;ertion a ground of an important con&s;equence, is not warrantable by the laws of rea&s;oning and philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>BUT if the a&s;&s;ertion were ever &s;o true, the con&s;equence, which Dr. C. thence draws, would by no means follow.&mdash; If <GAP DESC="foreign">
in the &s;ingular did almo&s;t perpetually &s;ignify a limi|ted duration, it would not follow, that <GAP DESC="foreign">
too
<PB N="268" REF="022478_0273_0FB92F8F0C079318">
&s;ignifies a limited duration. Language is not made meta|phy&s;ically by philo&s;ophers, but by the vulgar, without me|taphy&s;ical rea&s;oning: and the meaning of particular phra|&s;es is wholly determined by u&s;e, not by metaphy&s;ical rea|&s;oning on the natural force of the words. If therefore u&s;e have determined <GAP DESC="foreign">
to mean generally or univer&s;ally an endle&s;s duration, this is enough to &s;ettle the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, let <GAP DESC="foreign">
mean in the &s;ingular what it may.</P>
<P>OR if we mu&s;t rea&s;on metaphy&s;ically on this &s;ubject, it may be a&s;&s;erted, that <GAP DESC="foreign">
is no ab&s;urd or unintelligible mode of expre&s;&s;ing an endle&s;s du|ration. If <GAP DESC="foreign">

Therefore, that age, tho&s;e ages, or that duration, which comprehends all tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive ages, is a proper eternity. The Doctor undertakes to rea&s;on metaphy&s;ically on this &s;ubject,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 297, 298.</NOTE> and ob&s;erves, that
<Q>a duration for eternities of eternities, is a ve|ry uncouth mode of expre&s;&s;ion.</Q>
&mdash;But it is not more uncouth, than the expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>An eternity added to an eternity,</HI> or <HI>an eternity and an eternity.</HI> Yet this is the &s;trict analy&s;is of <HI>forever and ever,</HI> an expre&s;&s;ion rendered abundantly proper by u&s;e.</P>
<P>ONE thing more ought to be ob&s;erved, that <GAP DESC="foreign">, whe|ther in the &s;ingular or plural, governed by the prepo&s;ition <GAP DESC="foreign">, invariably in the New Te&s;tament, &s;ignifies an endle&s;s duration. But in the phra&s;e in que&s;tion, <GAP DESC="foreign">
it is governed by that prepo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT though <GAP DESC="foreign">, the plural, is met with in &s;e|veral places in the Septuagint, yet in them all it &s;ignifies a limited duration.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 296.</NOTE>&mdash;An&s;. 1. It does not appear, that <GAP DESC="foreign">
in the Septuagint always &s;ignifies a limited durati|on; nor is it u&s;ed in this &s;en&s;e in all the in&s;tances, which Dr. C. produces to prove, that it always means a limited duration: as P&s;al. CXLV. 13.
<Q>Thy kingdom is an e|verla&s;ting kingdom: <GAP DESC="foreign">.</Q>
Dan. II. 44;
<Q>In the days of the&s;e kings, the God of heaven &s;hall &s;et up a kingdom&mdash;and it &s;hall &s;tand forever, <GAP DESC="foreign">.</Q>
Though the Doctor endeavours to prove,
<PB N="269" REF="022478_0274_0FB92F8FFB705EA0">
that in the&s;e texts a limited duration mu&s;t be intended, be|cau&s;e in 1 Cor. XV. 28, Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented as delivering up his kingdom to the Father; yet it is at lea&s;t as clearly proved by Luke I. 33, "Of his kingdom there is no end," and the other texts before quoted,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 235, &amp;c.</NOTE> that the texts now in que&s;tion are to be taken in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e.&mdash;Be&s;ides, how does it appear, that P&s;al. CXLV. 13, refers to the kingdom of Chri&s;t, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the kingdom of the Father? And the kingdom of the Father Dr. C. al|lows, is without end.</P>
<P>THERE are other texts, in which <GAP DESC="foreign">
&s;eems beyond di&s;pute to be u&s;ed in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e; as P&s;al. LXXVII. 7.
<Q>Will the Lord ca&s;t off forever, <GAP DESC="foreign">? and will he be favourable <HI>no more</HI>?</Q>
The latter expre&s;&s;ion explains the former to mean an endle&s;s duration. The next ver&s;es further confirm this idea.&mdash;Dan. IV. 34;
<Q>I prai&s;ed and honoured him, that liveth <HI>forever,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">.</Q>
Chap. VI. 26;

If <GAP DESC="foreign">
be not in the&s;e in&s;tances u&s;ed in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e, it is in vain to &s;earch for in&s;tances, in which it is u&s;ed in that &s;en&s;e; and it may be pre&s;umed, that it is incapable of any applicati|on, by which it &s;hall appear to be u&s;ed in that &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>ANS. 2. But if it were ever &s;o true, that <GAP DESC="foreign">

are always in the Septuagint, to be under|&s;tood in the limited &s;en&s;e.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 301.</NOTE></P>
<P>An&s;wer 1. IT is by no means a conceded point, that tho&s;e phra&s;es in the Septuagint are always to be under&s;tood in a limited &s;en&s;e. The contrary appears even from the in|&s;tances quoted by Dr. C. to prove that they are u&s;ed in the limited &s;en&s;e; as P&s;al. CXIX. 44,
<Q>So &s;hall I keep thy law continually forever and ever.</Q>
P&s;al. CXLV. 2, "I will prai&s;e thy name forever and ever." To &s;up|po&s;e, that the&s;e texts contain no more, than a profe&s;&s;ed in|tention of the p&s;almi&s;t, to obey and to prai&s;e God, as long as he &s;hould live in this world, is as arbitrary a &s;up|po&s;ition, as to &s;uppo&s;e, that when the &s;criptures &s;peak of God as living forever and ever, they mean no more, than that God will live as long as men live in this world.</P>
<P>An&s;wer 2. BUT if tho&s;e phra&s;es in the Septuagint did ever &s;o certainly mean a limited duration, it would not fol|low, that al&s;o the very different phra&s;e <GAP DESC="foreign">
in the New Te&s;tament, means a limited duration. The truth is, this la&s;t phra&s;e is not to be found in the Septua|gint, though it frequently occurs in the New Te&s;tament.
<PB N="271" REF="022478_0276_0FB92F93B386CBC0">
Be it &s;o therefore, that tho&s;e phra&s;es in the Septuagint, mean a limited duration; is it not very &s;ingular argumen|tation, thence to infer, that a very different phra&s;e found in the New Te&s;tament, means a limited duration too? This is ju&s;t as if Dr. C. had argued, that becau&s;e the word <HI>lion</HI> in the Septuagint means a four-footed bea&s;t, therefore the word <HI>man</HI> in the New Te&s;tament means a four-footed bea&s;t too.</P>
<P>THE Doctor<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 303.</NOTE> holds, that
<Q>it is of no &s;ignificancy, that this phra&s;e is &s;ometimes applied to God:</Q>
becau&s;e, if from this application merely, we argue the ab&s;olute e|ternity of God; we may argue the ab&s;olute eternity of the land of Canaan, and of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations of men, from the application to them, of the &s;ame or an equivalent phra&s;e.&mdash;But the &s;ame phra&s;e is never applied, either to the land of Canaan, or to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations of men: and whatever other phra&s;e is applied to them, is by that very application proved not to be equivalent: Becau&s;e we have no other po&s;&s;ible way to know, that any phra&s;e is equi|valent, than by its application to tho&s;e &s;ubjects alone, which are of equal duration with tho&s;e, to which alone the phra&s;e in que&s;tion is applied.&mdash;The Doctor proceeds;
<Q>Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ures us, that the duration of God will have no end</Q>
&mdash;for this cau&s;e,
<Q>not from the force of this phra&s;e, we interpret it when applied to God, as mean|ing a duration without end.</Q>
But is not the eternity of God revealed in &s;cripture, as well as known by rea&s;on? If &s;o, where and in what words is it expre&s;&s;ed? Let any more determinate expre&s;&s;ion of it be pointed out in the &s;criptures. If the divine eternity be clearly revealed in &s;cripture, and this phra&s;e be as determinately expre&s;&s;ive of it, as any in the bible, doubtle&s;s it determines the future puni&s;hment of the wicked al&s;o, to be without end, becau&s;e it is repeatedly applied to that.</P>
<P>FINALLY, the Doctor ob&s;erves,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 304.</NOTE>
<Q>That it is as certain, that the phra&s;e <GAP DESC="foreign">, ought to be con|&s;trued <HI>for ages of ages,</HI> as that the wicked in the re|&s;urrection &s;tate, will not be incorruptible, but &s;hall die a &s;econd time.</Q>
That the wicked &s;hall reap corruption, and &s;hall &s;uffer the &s;econd death, is not in the lea&s;t incon|&s;i&s;tent with their endle&s;s mi&s;ery, unle&s;s corruption and the &s;econd death mean either annihilation or final happine&s;s. If
<PB N="272" REF="022478_0277_0FB92F952B6B6310">
they mean the &s;ame with the de&s;truction of the wicked, they mean mi&s;ery, as Doctor C. him&s;elf allows; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 224.</NOTE> and no man will &s;ay, that the declarations of &s;cripture, that the wicked &s;hall reap <HI>mi&s;ery,</HI> or &s;uffer mi&s;ery, are a proof, that that mi&s;ery is not endle&s;s. Or if corruption and the &s;econd death mean a tran&s;ition from the re&s;urrection &s;tate, to the next &s;ucceeding &s;tate, if any &s;uch there be, &s;till that &s;ucceed|ing &s;tate, or the final &s;tate of the wicked, may be a &s;tate of mi&s;ery. But if corruption and the &s;econd death mean annihilation, they overthrow the &s;alvation of all men. Is it not therefore &s;urprizing, that Dr. C. &s;hould over and over again, in&s;i&s;t on an argument, as fully demon&s;trative of his &s;cheme, which argument either wholly overthrows his &s;cheme, or is utterly impertinent to the &s;ubject?</P>
<P>ON the whole, it is left with the reader to determine, whether the rea&s;ons offered by Dr. C. prove, that <GAP DESC="foreign">

<P>NEXT occurs Dr. C's an&s;wer to the argument from Mark IX. 43;
<Q>The fire that never &s;hall be quenched; where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</Q>
&mdash;The Doctor's an&s;wer con&s;i&s;ts of the&s;e particulars&mdash; That the <HI>fire</HI> of hell may never be quenched; yet the wicked may not live in it endle&s;&s;ly<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 311.</NOTE>&mdash;That <HI>in hell,</HI> or while the wicked are in the next &s;tate of exi&s;tence, their worm indeed &s;hall not die, and their fire &s;hall not be quench|ed; but their torment &s;hall be continued during their ex|i&s;tence in that &s;tate.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>&mdash;As to the fir&s;t ob&s;ervation, That the fire of hell may never be quenched, though the wick|ed &s;hall be delivered out of it in time, by either &s;alvation or annihilation; it has been ob&s;erved to be a mere wild conjecture, and probably would never have been thought of, had not the &s;cheme been in di&s;tre&s;s, and mu&s;t be re|lieved
<PB N="273" REF="022478_0278_0FB92F975B0EBE18">
by &s;ome means of other. Other remarks have been made on this conjecture, to which I refer the reader. &mdash;Nor does the latter ob&s;ervation, e&s;pecially as connect|ed with the former, appear to be more rational or perti|nent. According to the&s;e two ob&s;ervations, the &s;en&s;e of Mark IX. 43, 44, is merely this; It is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go into the fire which never &s;hall be quenched, though thou maye&s;t &s;oon be delivered out of it; and in which while thou con|tinue&s;t, thy torments will not cea&s;e. But where is the evidence of the truth of this propo&s;ition? How does it ap|pear to be better for a man to cut off his right hand, and be forever after maimed, than to go into a fire which is in|deed endle&s;s, and in which while he continues, he will be unea&s;y, and even feel torment; though he may not con|tinue in it two minutes or two &s;econds? Who would not choo&s;e to &s;uffer even a very painful torment, for a few &s;e|conds, or minutes, rather than to lo&s;e an hand or an eye? Thus the &s;en&s;e which Dr. C. puts on Mark IX. 43, &amp;c. utterly fru&s;trates the manife&s;t de&s;ign of our Lord, which was in that pa&s;&s;age to exhibit a mo&s;t powerful motive to the greate&s;t &s;elf-denial. But according to the Doctor's con&s;truction, the pa&s;&s;age contains no powerful motive to &s;elf-denial, or any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; is it not flat and in&s;ipid, to tell a man, that he &s;hall go into a fire which never &s;hall be quenched, though he may be immediately taken out again?&mdash;Yet this is the &s;en&s;e which Dr. C. puts on tho&s;e words of our Saviour! But how is it to the purpo&s;e? or how does it concern any man, if he be not in the fire of hell, that that fire &s;hall never be quenched?&mdash;Suppo&s;e a man is to be burnt at the &s;take. It would be a matter of indifference to him, whether the fire, in which he &s;hould be put to death, be continued burning for five hundred years, after his death, or be extingui&s;hed immediately: and to tell him by way of threatening, that that fire &s;hall be kept up five hundred years after his death; or to threaten a criminal who is a|bout to be executed on the gallows, that the gallows on which he &s;hall die, &s;hall &s;tand a thou&s;and years after his execution; would be perfect impertinence.</P>
<P>DOCTOR C. &s;eems to in&s;i&s;t much on this, That in Mark IX. 43, &amp;c, a reference is had to the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e who&s;e bodies were either burnt in the valley of Hin|nom,
<PB N="274" REF="022478_0279_0FB92F987293C100">
or permitted to lie upon the ground, to be fed upon by worms. But it does not thence follow, as Dr. C. &s;up|po&s;es, that as the fire of the valley of Hinnom went out, when the bodies were con&s;umed, and the worm died, when the bodies were eaten up; &s;o the fire and worm of hell &s;hall cea&s;e. The &s;en&s;e may be, that as tho&s;e bodies in the valley Hinnom, were con&s;umed by fire and worms, which after a while cea&s;ed; &s;o the wicked in hell &s;hall be tormented by fire and worms, which &s;hall not cea&s;e.&mdash; Indeed this is expre&s;&s;ly a&s;&s;erted: and as Mr. Hopkins ju&s;t|ly ob&s;erves.
<Q>It cannot be granted, that our Saviour, by tho&s;e words,</Q>
<Q>Where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched,</Q>
means a worm that <HI>dieth,</HI>
<Q>and a fire that <HI>is quenched</HI> very &s;oon. For this would be to &s;uppo&s;e, he <HI>means</HI> directly contrary to what he <HI>&s;ays.</HI></Q>

<P>THE Doctor argues again&s;t endle&s;s puni&s;hment from the &s;mallne&s;s of the number of tho&s;e who are &s;aved in the next &s;tate.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 322.</NOTE> That "only a few of mankind" &s;hould be &s;aved finally, and "the greater part eternally peri&s;h" he thinks not reconcileable with the great mercy of the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation; or with the glad tidings of great joy, and the divine good will celebrated at the birth of our Savi|our. This argument is built on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that it would not be di&s;honorary to Chri&s;t, that a minority of mankind be lo&s;t. But this would be equally incon&s;i&s;tent with Dr. C's &s;cheme, as that a majority be lo&s;t. This argument, as it grants that &s;ome will not be &s;aved, gives up the grand que&s;tion, and di&s;putes concerning the number only, which is to be &s;aved. But this is no &s;ubject of di&s;pute in this controver&s;y.</P>
<P>IS it then no in&s;tance of great and glorious mercy, to in|&s;titute a &s;cheme, by which &s;alvation may be offered to eve|ry creature; By which who&s;oever will, may take the wa|ter of life freely, and no man &s;hall peri&s;h, but in con&s;e|quence of his own voluntary rejection of that in&s;titution? Is not the certain information of this in&s;titution indeed glad tidings of great joy to all people? Is not the in&s;titution a clear proof of the abundant good will of God to men, even though &s;inners, through their voluntary oppo&s;ition, obtain no good by it? It certainly is, if we may believe Dr. C. for it is a maxim with him,
<Q>that we mu&s;t not judge of

<P>THE Doctor &s;ays,
<Q>It is incredible, that God &s;hould con|&s;titute his Son the Saviour of men, and the <HI>bulk</HI> of them be finally damned.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 323.</NOTE> But why is it incredible? Is it not an undertaking worthy of Chri&s;t, in a way mo&s;t hono|rary to God, to open a door of mercy and &s;alvation to all mankind, though by the wicked and ungrateful rejection of Chri&s;t by the majority, a minority only will actually be &s;aved? If it be not credible, that God &s;hould con&s;titute his &s;on the &s;aviour of men, and "the <HI>bulk</HI>" of them be final|ly damned, is it credible, that Chri&s;t &s;hould be con&s;tituted the &s;aviour, and a bare majority of mankind be &s;aved? If not, how large mu&s;t the majority be?</P>
<P>AS to the ob&s;ervation,
<Q>That it is a gro&s;s reflection on the &s;aviour, who&s;e proper bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to de&s;troy the works of the devil, and re&s;cue mankind out of his hands; to &s;uppo&s;e, that the devil &s;hould finally get the better of Chri&s;t, by effecting the everla&s;ting damnation of the greater part of men;</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> there are &s;ome particulars in it, which want explanation. Fir&s;t; what is meant by de|&s;troying the works of the devil? If this mean to aboli&s;h all &s;in, and all the mi&s;ery con&s;equent on &s;in to any of the hu|man race; it is not granted, that this is <HI>the proper bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of our Saviour, nor is this the proper meaning of the ori|ginal in 1 Joh. III. 8, the text to which Dr. C. refers. The verb is <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>di&s;&s;olve, take to pieces,</HI> and thus prevent the ill effect of the works of the devil. But if de&s;troying the works of the devil mean, to defeat and to prevent the ill con&s;equences of tho&s;e works, &s;o that no final damage &s;hall thence ari&s;e to the intere&s;t of God's kingdom, or of the univer&s;e; it is granted, that this is the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of Chri&s;t. But it is not granted, but that this maybe ef|fected, without the &s;alvation of all men.&mdash;Again, what is meant by "the devil's getting the better of Chri&s;t?" This doubtle&s;s means, that he defeats Chri&s;t more or le&s;s, as to &s;ome object of his mediatorial undertaking. But Dr. C. has no more made it appear, that the final &s;alvation of only a part, and a &s;mall part of the human race, implies
<PB N="276" REF="022478_0281_0FB92FA05DC667F0">
&s;uch a defeat; or that it was not the original intention of Chri&s;t to &s;ave a &s;mall part only; than he has made it ap|pear, that it was the intention of Chri&s;t to &s;ave all men.</P>
<P>Dr. C. &s;eems not to have reflected, while he was urging this argument, that it equally militates again&s;t his own la&s;t re&s;ort, annihilation. For if an
<Q>end be put to the exi&s;t|ence, both in &s;oul and body,</Q>
of all who die impeni|tent, as the Doctor allows will be the ca&s;e, if univer&s;al &s;alvation be not true;<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 282.</NOTE> then on his principles, the devil will not be vanqui&s;hed by Chri&s;t; the works of the devil will not be de&s;troyed, but
<Q>he will get the better of Chri&s;t, by effecting the everla&s;ting de&s;truction of the greater part of tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t came from heaven to &s;ave.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 324.</NOTE> &mdash;So that when this objection &s;hall be an&s;wered, &s;o far as it lies again&s;t Dr. C's la&s;t re&s;ort, doubtle&s;s an an&s;wer will be &s;upplied to tho&s;e who believe in endle&s;s mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>After all, it is not an article of my faith, that only a &s;mall part of the human race will be finally &s;aved. But my faith in this particular is not built on ab&s;tract rea&s;on|ings from the divine goodne&s;s and the mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t. That divine goodne&s;s which &s;uffered <HI>all</HI> the apo&s;tate angels to peri&s;h finally, might have &s;uffered all, or a greater part of the apo&s;tate race of men, to peri&s;h in like manner. My faith is built on &s;everal repre&s;entations and prophecies of &s;cripture, particularly concerning the millennium, and the general and long prevalence of virtue and piety in that pe|riod. Therefore in this view, the foundation of the objec|tion from the &s;mallne&s;s of the number &s;aved, is taken a|way.</P>

<P>THE Doctor an&s;wers to the argument from Mark XIV. 21,
<Q>Wo to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. Good were it for that man, if he had never been born;</Q>
That perhaps it may be a pro|verbial expre&s;&s;ion, not literally true;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 329.</NOTE>&mdash;That if the li|teral &s;en&s;e were the mo&s;t rea&s;onable, con&s;idering this text by it&s;elf; yet con&s;idering the many pa&s;&s;ages brought by Dr. C. which declare the final &s;alvation of all men, we mu&s;t not under&s;tand this pa&s;&s;age in the literal &s;en&s;e, as in that ca&s;e we &s;hall &s;et the &s;cripture at variance with it&s;elf;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 330.</NOTE> &mdash;That the real meaning of this pa&s;&s;age may be propheti|cal, as if our Lord had &s;aid,
<Q>The man who &s;hall betray me &s;hall practically declare, that in his apprehen&s;ion, it were good had he not been brought into being.</Q>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 331.</NOTE>&mdash; As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e an&s;wers, it is a mere un&s;upported conjecture, and therefore is to be &s;et down for nothing.&mdash; As to the &s;econd, it is not allowed that the Doctor has produced any one pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture which declares the final &s;alvation of all men: but this in view of what has been &s;aid on the pa&s;&s;ages produced by the Doctor, is &s;ub|mitted to the reader.&mdash;As the Doctor contends that this pa&s;&s;age cannot be under&s;tood in the literal &s;en&s;e, without &s;etting the &s;cripture at variance with it&s;elf; &s;o it is contend|ed by the advocates for endle&s;s puni&s;hment, that it can be under&s;tood in the literal &s;en&s;e, without &s;etting the &s;cripture at variance with it&s;elf in the lea&s;t degree; and that the ge|neral tenor of the &s;cripture points out the literal &s;en&s;e to be the true &s;en&s;e.&mdash;As to Dr. C's third an&s;wer, it is, in the fir&s;t place, a mere un&s;upported conjecture: &s;econd|ly, it may be noticed, that it is manife&s;t, that the text
<PB N="278" REF="022478_0283_0FB92FA3701236A0">
pronounces the proper wo or cur&s;e, which &s;hould fall on the man who &s;hould betray our Lord.
<Q>The Son of Man indeed goeth, as it is written of him; but wo to that man, by whom the Son of Man is betrayed: good were it for that man, if he had never been born.</Q>
&mdash; But according to Dr. C. all the cur&s;e which this text de|nounces, is &s;uch a wearine&s;s of life and impatience of ex|i&s;tence, as has &s;ometimes befallen even true &s;aints; as in the in&s;tance of Job. And is it credible that this was the proper and full cur&s;e of betraying the Lord of life and glory? Or that if this be but a very &s;mall part of the cur&s;e of that abominable wickedne&s;s, our Lord would have mentioned it in &s;uch a manner, as naturally to communicate the idea, that it is the proper and full cur&s;e of it?</P>
<P>AFTER all the ingenuity of Dr. C. and other univer|&s;ali&s;ts, in torturing this pa&s;&s;age to a meaning con&s;i&s;tent with their &s;cheme; it remains a plain, direct, and po&s;itive te&s;ti|mony again&s;t it.</P>
<P>NEXT follows Dr. C's&punc; an&s;wer to the argument from what is &s;aid concerning the &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, Matt. XII. 32;
<Q>Who&s;oever &s;peaketh again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, it &s;hall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</Q>
Mark III. 29;
<Q>He that &s;hall bla&s;pheme again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t hath ne|ver forgivene&s;s, but is in danger of eternal damna|tion.</Q>
Luke XII. 10,
<Q>Unto him that bla&s;phemeth again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, it &s;hall not be forgiven.</Q></P>
<P>THE Doctor's fir&s;t an&s;wer to this argument is taken from <HI>Grotius</HI>&mdash;he tells us that <HI>Grotius</HI>
<Q>looks upon the words as an Hebrai&s;m intended to &s;ignify, <HI>not &s;o much</HI> the par|donablene&s;s of &s;ome &s;ins, and the unpardonablene&s;s of others; as the greater difficulty of obtaining pardon for bla&s;phemy again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, than for any other bla&s;phemy.</Q>
It is wholy immaterial whether the words were intended to &s;ignify <HI>not &s;o much</HI> the unpardonablene&s;s of &s;ome &s;ins. If they were intended to &s;ignify <HI>at all</HI> the unpardonablene&s;s of &s;ome &s;ins, that is &s;ufficient for the pre|&s;ent purpo&s;e. So that both Dr. C. and his favourite author <HI>Grotius,</HI> virtually concede all that is demanded in this in|&s;tance.</P>
<P>CONCERNING this con&s;truction of <HI>Grotius,</HI> which is but a mere conjecture, brought in to help over an argument
<PB N="279" REF="022478_0284_0FB92FA4F74830F0">
which crouds hardly on Dr. C's &s;cheme; the Doctor &s;ays,
<Q>Whoever goes about to prove, that there is no truth in it, will perhaps find, that he has undertaken a very hard ta&s;k.</Q>
The &s;ame may be &s;aid of any man, who &s;hould undertake to prove, that there are not a dozen pri|mary planets belonging to the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem; or who &s;hould undertake to di&s;prove any one of a thou&s;and other conjec|tures.</P>
<P>AFTER all, the Doctor does not depend much on this con&s;truction of <HI>Grotius,</HI> and proceeds to give us his own &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ages above quoted; which is, That it is indeed true, that
<Q>the bla&s;phemy again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t is ab&s;olutely unpardonable;</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 334.</NOTE> that the divine law &s;hall take its cour&s;e on tho&s;e who are guilty of that bla&s;phemy, and no intervening pardon will prevent the full execution of the threatened penalty on them; and forgivene&s;s &s;trict|ly and literally &s;peaking will not be granted to them;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 336.</NOTE> yet that they will be finally &s;aved, and admitted to heaven, after they &s;hall have &s;uffered the full penalty threatened in the law.&mdash;On this idea of Dr. C. &s;ome remarks have been already made in Chapter I. Nor can it e&s;cape the notice of the attentive reader, that it implies, that &s;ome men are &s;aved, not only without forgivene&s;s; without the exerci&s;e of divine grace, in the &s;criptural &s;en&s;e of grace; without any aid from the merit or atonement of Chri&s;t; and therefore not
<Q>on the account, on the ground, or for the rea&s;on of Chri&s;t's obedience and death;</Q>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 20.</NOTE> but wholly on the footing of the law. But the idea that any of mankind are to be &s;aved without forgivene&s;s, is wholly foreign from the &s;criptures, nor can it be pointed out to be contained in any part of &s;cripture. Every chapter of the go&s;pel is incon&s;i&s;tent with it; to refer to parti|cular texts would be endle&s;s and needle&s;s.&mdash;And what divine grace is there exerci&s;ed in the &s;alvation of one, who has by &s;uffering the whole threatened penalty of the law, made full &s;atisfaction for his own &s;ins?&mdash; There is manife&s;tly no more <HI>grace</HI> in &s;aving &s;uch a man, than there is in &s;aving one who has ne|ver &s;inned. Nor is he who has &s;uffered the full penalty of the law, &s;aved on account of the death or obedience of Chri&s;t. On the account of Chri&s;t's obedience or death he is relea&s;ed from no puni&s;hment: and to &s;uppo&s;e, that God
<PB N="280" REF="022478_0285_0FB92FA66DEDF328">
has not goodne&s;s enough, without an atonement, to take a creature to heaven, who in the eye of the law is per|fectly innocent, is a &s;uppo&s;ition utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine goodne&s;s.&mdash;La&s;tly, he who is &s;aved in con&s;e|quence of &s;uffering the whole penalty threatened in the law, is &s;aved on the foot of law. Yet it is utterly and a|bundantly denied by Dr. C. to be po&s;&s;ible, that any &s;inner &s;hould be &s;aved on the foot of law.</P>
<P>IN view of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, the reader will judge, whether Dr. C's con&s;truction of the pa&s;&s;ages, which &s;peak of the &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, be admi&s;&s;ible: and whether tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages and the argument deduced from them, do not remain in full force again&s;t univer&s;al &s;alvation.</P>
<P>WE come at length to Dr. C's an&s;wer to the la&s;t argu|ment of tho&s;e in the oppo&s;ite &s;cheme which he con&s;iders, which is drawn from the tendency of Dr. C's &s;y&s;tem to li|centiou&s;ne&s;s and vice.</P>
<P>ON this the Doctor ob&s;erves;
<Q>To di&s;prove the final &s;alvation of all men, it mu&s;t be plainly &s;hown, that this doctrine does naturally and directly tend to encourage men in vitious practice.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 341.</NOTE></Q>
In this it is implicitly grant|ed, that if the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation do indeed na|turally and directly tend to encourage men to per&s;i&s;t in vi|tious practice, it is not true. On this we may join i&s;&s;ue with him. That that doctrine does comparatively encou|rage men to per&s;i&s;t in vice, will appear perhaps from the following con&s;iderations.&mdash;It will not be denied that if there were no puni&s;hment threatened to the wicked, it would naturally and directly encourage them to per&s;i&s;t in vice. This is granted by Dr. C.&mdash;
<Q>Had we attempted<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 342.</NOTE> to introduce mankind univer&s;ally into a &s;tate of happi|ne&s;s, upon their leaving this world, whatever their mo|ral conduct had been in it, the argument,</Q>
that Dr. C's &s;cheme tends to licentiou&s;ne&s;s,
<Q>would then have held &s;trong.</Q>
But if the argument holds &s;trong, provided there be no future puni&s;hment, it holds proportionably, if that puni&s;hment be very &s;mall and far le&s;s than is de&s;erved by the wicked; and e&s;pecially if at the &s;ame time that pu|ni&s;hment be &s;uited to their per&s;onal good. Now that the future puni&s;hment of the wicked is, on Dr. C's &s;cheme, very &s;mall, compared with what it is on the oppo&s;ite &s;cheme, is manife&s;t at fir&s;t &s;ight; it is infinitely le&s;s. And that it
<PB N="281" REF="022478_0286_0FB92FA80780E600">
is far le&s;s, nay infinitely le&s;s than the wicked de&s;erve, is manife&s;t by what Doctor C. as well as his oponents, al|lows, that all who are &s;aved, are &s;aved by <HI>unbounded grace.</HI> Therefore, if the damned be finally &s;aved, as they are &s;aved by unbounded grace, they are puni&s;hed infinitely le&s;s than they de&s;erve. Al&s;o, that according to Dr. C's &s;cheme, the wicked are to be puni&s;hed with a di&s;ciplinary puni&s;hment &s;uited to the good of the &s;ubjects, is manife&s;t from his whole book.&mdash;Now that this puni&s;hment of the wicked does comparatively encourage vice, may be illu&s;|trated by an example. It is generally agreed that murder de&s;erves death. But &s;uppo&s;e a law &s;hould be made, by which no murderer &s;hould be puni&s;hed with death, or with any other puni&s;hment to be continued longer, than till he &s;hould repent. Would not &s;uch a law as this, compared with the law as it now &s;tands, naturally and directly tend to encourage murder? I need not make the applica|tion.</P>
<P>DOCTOR C. &s;eems to think that his doctrine of future puni&s;hment even more powerfully re&s;trains from &s;in, than the doctrine of endle&s;s puni&s;hment, becau&s;e his doctrine is more credible to men in general. But are we to inquire what is mo&s;t likely or mo&s;t ea&s;y to be believed by men in general, to determine what is mo&s;t likely to re&s;train from &s;in or to be the real truth of God? Then certainly the doctrines of the divine character and mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, of his miracles, re&s;urrection, a&s;cen&s;ion, &amp;c, &amp;c, in &s;hort the doctrines of chri&s;tianity in general, are not &s;o likely to re|&s;train men from &s;in as the doctrines of mere natural reli|gion. Or if it be &s;aid that tho&s;e doctrines are capable of &s;uch proof, as will &s;atisfy and convince all candid inquirers; the &s;ame is &s;aid of the doctrine of endle&s;s puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>I HAVE now fini&s;hed my reply to Dr. C's an&s;wers to the arguments in favour of endle&s;s puni&s;hment; and having before con&s;idered his arguments in favour of his own &s;cheme; I &s;hall proceed to &s;ome arguments in confirmation of the doctrine of endle&s;s puni&s;hment.</P>

With regard to the other two phra&s;es, it has been found, that they are without exception u&s;ed in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e. Nor does the Greek language furni&s;h any word more determinately expre&s;&s;ive of endle&s;s duration: and notwith&s;tanding what Dr. C. &s;ays to the contrary, it appears that they do as properly and determinately expre&s;s an endle&s;s duration, as the Engli&s;h words <HI>eternal</HI> and <HI>eternity.</HI> If therefore the&s;e words be explained away to mean a mere temporary dura|tion, it is impo&s;&s;ible that any words be u&s;ed, which would not &s;uffer the &s;ame treatment from the &s;ame hands.</P>
<P>THE texts concerning the &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t &s;till remain a clear proof of endle&s;s puni&s;hment. They are Matt. XII. 31, 32;
<Q>The bla&s;phemy again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;hall not be forgiven unto men&mdash;Who&s;oever &s;peaketh again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, it &s;hall not be forgiven him, neither in this world neither in the world to come.</Q>
Mark III. 29:
<Q>He that &s;hall bla&s;pheme again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, hath never forgivene&s;s; but is in danger of eternal damnation.</Q>
Luke XII. 10; Unto him that
<Q>bla&s;phemeth again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, it &s;hall not be for|given.</Q></P>
<P>SO long as the go&s;pel rejects every idea of the &s;alva|tion of men without forgivene&s;s, &s;o long will the&s;e texts confute the &s;alvation of all men.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e I may add the following texts; 1 John V. 16;
<Q>If any man &s;ee his brother &s;in a &s;in which is not unto death, he &s;hall a&s;k, and he &s;hall give him life, for them that &s;in not unto death. There is a &s;in <HI>unto death. I do not &s;ay that he &s;hall pray for it.</HI></Q>
So that we are not to pray for tho&s;e who &s;in unto death. Why not? evi|dently becau&s;e their &s;alvation is impo&s;&s;ible. If their &s;al|vation be po&s;&s;ible, I pre&s;ume no &s;ufficient rea&s;on can be gi|ven, why we &s;hould not pray for it. If it &s;hould be &s;aid that we are not to pray that the &s;alvation of &s;uch &s;hould be immediately accompli&s;hed, but that it may be accompli&s;h|ed
<PB N="284" REF="022478_0289_0FB92FB5670B1248">
in due time: the an&s;wer is at hand, that we are not at liberty to pray that any man may be &s;aved <HI>out of</HI> due time; and in this &s;en&s;e we are prohibited to pray for the &s;alvation of any man.</P>
<P>Heb. VI. 4&mdash;6;
<Q>For it is impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e who were once enlightened, and have ta&s;ted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Gho&s;t, and have ta&s;ted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come; if they &s;hall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance.</Q>
Since it is impo&s;&s;ible to renew &s;uch to repentance, it is according to Dr. C. as well as the &s;cipture, impo&s;&s;ible that they be &s;aved. Of like import is Chapter X. 26, 27;
<Q>For if we &s;in wil|fully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more &s;acrifice for &s;ins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery in|dignation, which &s;hall devour the adver&s;aries.</Q>
If there remain <HI>no more or no longer</HI> a &s;acrifice for &s;ins; then neither will the man who&s;e character is here de&s;cribed, be able by his own &s;ufferings to make a &s;acrifice of &s;atisfaction for his &s;ins, nor will the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t be longer of any avail to him. And if the judgment and fiery indignation, which &s;hall devour the adver&s;aries, remain for him; he mu&s;t &s;uffer them without a po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape, either by the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t or in con&s;equence of his own &s;uffer|ings.</P>
<P>THE wo denounced by Chri&s;t on Judas al&s;o &s;eems to re|main a demon&s;trative proof of endle&s;s puni&s;hment. Matt. XXVI. 24, and Mark XIV. 21;
<Q>Wo to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed: good were it for that man if he had never been born.</Q>
Let Judas &s;uffer a temporary mi&s;ery of ever &s;o great duration, it mu&s;t be in|finitely le&s;s than an endle&s;s duration of happine&s;s. So that if Judas were finally to enjoy endle&s;s happine&s;s, he would be an infinite gainer by his exi&s;tence, let the duration of his previous mi&s;ery be what it might. It was therefore on the &s;uppo&s;ition of his final &s;alvation, not only good, but infinitely good, that he had been born: which is a direct contradiction to the declaration of our Saviour.</P>
<P>IN connection with this pa&s;&s;age, I &s;hall introduce the following; Luke VI. 24;
<Q>Wo unto you that are rich: for ye have received your <HI>con&s;olation.</HI></Q>
On the &s;uppo|&s;ition of the &s;alvation of all men, the rich do by no means
<PB N="285" REF="022478_0290_0FB92FBEB5B3ECC0">
receive in this life their con&s;olation; but they are to re|ceive infinitely the greate&s;t con&s;olation in the future life.&mdash; P&s;alm XVII. 14;
<Q>From men of the world, who have their <HI>portion</HI> in this life;</Q>
Plainly implying that they are to have no portion in the future life. Luke XVI. 25;
<Q>Son, remember that thou in thy life time received&s;t thy good things,</Q>
If all &s;hall be &s;aved, the rich and the men of the world in no other &s;en&s;e have their portion in this life, than the re&s;t of men.&mdash;They have &s;ome good things in this world, but infinitely the greate&s;t part of their happine&s;s is to be enjoyed in the world to come, and what they enjoy here, is nothing in compari&s;on with what they are to enjoy hereafter. More than this, cannot be &s;aid of any man.</P>
<P>MARK IX. 43&mdash;49;
<Q>If thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee, to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go into hell, into the fire that ne|ver &s;hall be quenched: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet, to be ca&s;t into hell, into the fire that never &s;hall be quenched; where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God, with one eye, than having two eyes, to be ca&s;t into hell-fire: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</Q>
Mat. III. 12;
<Q>Who&s;e fan is in his hand, and he &s;hall thoroughly purge his floor; and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with <HI>unquenchable fire.</HI></Q></P>
<P>John III. 36.
<Q>He that believeth on the Son, hath e|verla&s;ting life: and he that believeth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</Q>
If all are to be &s;aved, then all will &s;ee life and enjoy it. Should it be &s;aid, that the meaning of this text is barely, that he that believeth not, &s;hall not &s;ee life, while he remains an unbeliever; it may be ob&s;erved, that this &s;en&s;e of the text will admit the idea, that unbelievers may all become believers, at death, or at &s;ome future time in life; as it holds forth no more, than that a man while an unbeliever, &s;hall not be admitted to life; and &s;ays nothing but that all unbelievers may become believers in this life, or at death; and therefore may attain to life and &s;alvation in heaven,
<PB N="286" REF="022478_0291_0FB92FC1A19F8758">
ju&s;t as &s;oon as tho&s;e, who are now believers. But can any man bring him&s;elf to believe, that this text was not de|&s;igned to teach us, but that unbelievers will attain to the life and &s;alvation of heaven as &s;oon as believers? If that be the true &s;en&s;e, this text teaches us no more concerning un|believers, than is true concerning all &s;aints in this &s;tate of imperfection. It may on this &s;uppo&s;ition be &s;aid, with e|qual truth, and in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, that no imperfect &s;aint &s;hall &s;ee life, as that no unbeliever &s;hall &s;ee life. It is plain, that this text was meant to exhibit &s;ome privilege on the believer above the unbeliever. But if the con|&s;truction, now under con&s;ideration, be the true one, and u|niver&s;al &s;alvation be true, what is that privilege? The be|liever has the promi&s;e of an endle&s;s life; &s;o has the unbe|liever in common with all mankind. The believer cannot perhaps be admitted to the inheritance of that promi&s;e, within le&s;s than ten or twenty years. Within the &s;ame time the unbeliever may be admitted to the &s;ame inheri|tance, whether he be admitted to it at death, or in con|&s;equence of &s;ome di&s;cipline in hell, by which he is led to repentance and faith. The believer has the pre&s;ent com|fort of anticipating his future happine&s;s; there is on the plan of univer&s;al &s;alvation, abundant foundation for the &s;ame anticipation to the unbeliever. It is true, the unbe|liever is not yet prepared for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of heavenly hap|pine&s;s: neither is the believer during his pre&s;ent imper|fection.</P>

<Q>the wicked is driven away in his wickedne&s;s; but the righteous hath hope in his death.</Q>
But according to the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem, the wicked hath in his death as real and well founded a hope as the hope of the righteous. Job XI. 20, "Their hope &s;hall be as the giving up of the gho&s;t." Chap. XXVII. 8;
<Q>For what is the hope of the hypo|crite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his &s;oul?</Q>
Phil. III. 19;
<Q>Who&s;e <HI>end</HI> is de&s;truc|tion.</Q>
But if all men be finally &s;aved, the <HI>end</HI> of no man is de&s;truction. Heb. VI. 8;
<Q>Who&s;e <HI>end</HI> is to be burn|ed.</Q>
&mdash;2 Cor. XI. 15;
<Q>Who&s;e <HI>end</HI> is according to their works.</Q>
This is &s;aid of the mini&s;ters of &s;atan, who&s;e works are certainly evil. Their end therefore being according to their works mu&s;t be evil too. How then can they be FINALLY &s;aved? If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that the&s;e texts do not mean the <HI>la&s;t</HI> end of the wicked; this would be a mere a&s;&s;ertion. As well might we &s;ay that Rom. VI. 22;
<Q>Ye have your fruit unto holine&s;s and the end everla&s;t|ing life,</Q>
means not the la&s;t end of the righteous.</P>
<P>THE &s;cripture repre&s;ents, that at the end of this world, all things are brought to <HI>an end.</HI> 1 Pet. IV. 7; "But the end of all things is <HI>at hand,</HI>" <GAP DESC="foreign">. Surely this can|not mean that the end of all things will take place after
<PB N="292" REF="022478_0297_0FB92FCF85E68368">
<HI>ages of ages</HI> to &s;ucceed the end of this world. A period &s;o di&s;tant is never in &s;cripture &s;aid to be <HI>at hand</HI>; nor could this with propriety, be &s;aid of &s;uch a period.&mdash; Matt. XXIV. 14;
<Q>This go&s;pel of the kingdom &s;hall be preached in all the world, for a witne&s;s to all nations: and <HI>then,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;hall the end come.</Q>
&mdash;But when all things &s;hall have come to their <HI>end,</HI> they will be in a fixed, unalterable &s;tate, and after that, there can be no pa&s;&s;ing from hell to heaven. Nor can there be any &s;uch pa&s;&s;ing after Chri&s;t &s;hall have delivered up the kingdom to the Fa|ther. To this Dr. C. agrees. But I have already gi|ven my rea&s;ons for believing that Chri&s;t will deliver up the kingdom to the Father, at the end of this world; and for believing that 1 Cor. XV. 24, mu&s;t be under&s;tood in this &s;en&s;e, and that according to Dr. C's explanation of that text, it cannot be reconciled with Matt. XIII. 40&mdash;44, and other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>2 COR. VI. 2;
<Q>Behold <HI>now</HI> is the accepted time; be|hold, <HI>now</HI> is the day of &s;alvation.</Q>
Heb. III. 7;
<Q><HI>To day,</HI> if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</Q>
But if the greater part of mankind &s;hall be &s;aved out of hell, and the means of repentance in hell be far more con|ducive to the end, than the be&s;t means u&s;ed in this world, it &s;hould have been &s;aid, In the future &s;tate is the accept|ed time, and in hell will be the day of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>2 COR. IV. 18;
<Q>The things which are &s;een, are tem|poral; but the things which are not &s;een, are <HI>eternal.</HI></Q>
If all the un&s;een things of the future &s;tate be eternal, the puni&s;hment of the damned is eternal. And eternal, <GAP DESC="foreign">, mu&s;t in this in&s;tance mean endle&s;s: otherwi&s;e all oppo&s;iti|on with regard to duration, between things &s;een, and things un&s;een, is lo&s;t; and things un&s;een are as truly tem|poral, as things &s;een. At mo&s;t, on Dr. C's principle of con&s;truing &s;cripture; the apo&s;tle's propo&s;ition comes to this merely: The things which are &s;een, are temporal, but the things which are un&s;een are to continue for an age. But this is true of many pre&s;ent &s;een things.</P>
<P>THE promi&s;es of the go&s;pel in general afford an argu|ment in favour of endle&s;s puni&s;hment.&mdash;Rev. II. 11;
<Q>He that overcometh, &s;hall not be hurt of the &s;econd death.</Q>
I pre&s;ume all will grant, that this promi&s;e im|plies, that all who do not overcome, &s;hall be hurt of the &s;econd death. Therefore, by parity of rea&s;on, when it is
<PB N="293" REF="022478_0298_0FB92FD0A1FD7E08">
promi&s;ed in the &s;ame chapter,
<Q>To him that overcometh, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the mid&s;t of the paradi&s;e of God;</Q>
it implies, that tho&s;e who do not overcome, &s;hall never eat of that tree,
<Q>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white &s;tone,</Q>
&amp;c, im|plies, that he who does not overcome, &s;hall never eat of the hidden manna, &s;hall never receive the white &s;tone, &amp;c.
<Q>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he &s;hall go no more out,</Q>
implies, that he who does not overcome, &s;hall not be a pillar in the temple of God.
<Q>To him that overcometh, will I grant to &s;it with me in my throne,</Q>
implies, that he who does not overcome, &s;hall never &s;it in Chri&s;t's throne. The&s;e I give as a &s;pecimen only of the promi&s;es, and of the argument which they afford.</P>
<P>FINALLY, if all &s;hall be &s;aved, why have not Chri&s;t, and tho&s;e who wrote by the in&s;piration of his &s;pirit, been explicit in the matter? Why have they u&s;ed &s;o many ex|pre&s;&s;ions, which in the literal &s;en&s;e a&s;&s;ert the contrary doc|trine? and which apparently ob&s;cure the truth, and blind the eyes of the readers of the New Te&s;tament? E&s;pecial|ly, if, as Dr. C. holds, univer&s;al &s;alvation be &s;o glorious to God, the main &s;ubject of the go&s;pel, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate the divine character? Surely this of all doctrines ought to have been indi&s;putably revealed, and not one hint given to the contrary.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e arguments drawn directly from texts of &s;cripture; I &s;hall mention one drawn from the general na|ture of the go&s;pel, or from the particular doctrines of the go&s;pel, acknowledged by both parties in this controver&s;y.</P>
<P>THOSE who die impenitent, de&s;erve an endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment. The proof of this hath been attempted, Chap. VI. It is briefly this: If endle&s;s puni&s;hment be not the penal|ty threatened in the law, and ju&s;tly de&s;erved by the &s;in|ner, no account can po&s;&s;ibly be given of the penalty of the law. It cannot be the temporary puni&s;hment actually &s;uf|fered by the damned; becau&s;e then the damned would be finally &s;aved without forgivene&s;s. It cannot be a tempo|rary puni&s;hment of le&s;s duration, than that which is &s;uffer|ed by the damned; becau&s;e on that &s;uppo&s;ition the damned are puni&s;hed more than they de&s;erve. It cannot be a tem|porary puni&s;hment of longer duration, than that which the &s;criptures abundantly declare the damned &s;hall &s;uffer; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="294" REF="022478_0299_0FB92C5313DF76A0">
no &s;uch puni&s;hment is threatened in the law, or in any part of &s;cripture. It mu&s;t therefore be an endle&s;s pu|ni&s;hment.&mdash;This endle&s;s puni&s;hment threatened in the law, is not annihilation, but endle&s;s mi&s;ery; becau&s;e if it were annihilation, none of the damned, on &s;uppo&s;ition, that they are all finally &s;aved, will be puni&s;hed with the cur&s;e of the law, or which is the &s;ame, with the puni&s;hment which they ju&s;tly de&s;erve. But both the &s;cripture and Dr. C. abundantly hold, that the damned will be puni&s;hed as much as they de&s;erve, as hath been &s;hewn Chap. III. But for the full proof, that the puni&s;hment of hell is not annihilation, I mu&s;t refer the reader to Chap. V. If the endle&s;s puni&s;hment threatened in the law, and de&s;erved by the wicked, be not annihilation, it mu&s;t be endle&s;s mi&s;ery. But whatever puni&s;hment the wicked ju&s;tly de&s;erve, they will in fact &s;uffer; they will have to pay the uttermo&s;t farthing; they will &s;uffer judgment without mercy. There|fore, they will &s;uffer not only an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, but an endle&s;s mi&s;ery, or torment.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame argument is a little differently &s;tated thus; Dr. C. allows, that if the puni&s;hment of the damned be in|tended to &s;atisfy ju&s;tice, it is impo&s;&s;ible all men &s;hould be &s;aved.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 11.</NOTE> He al&s;o holds abundantly, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, that any &s;inner &s;hould be ju&s;tified or &s;aved
"on the foot of law."
He equally holds this with regard to the moral law, "the law written in men's hearts,"
"the natural law,"
and the law is promulged in the go&s;pel by Je&s;us "Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles," as with regard to the
"Mo|&s;aic law."
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See 12 &s;erm. P. 4, &amp;c.</NOTE> He al&s;o holds, that
<Q>the law of God is a perfect rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q>
Now if it be impo&s;&s;i|ble that any &s;inner be ju&s;tified by the moral law, then eve|ry &s;inner is, and mu&s;t be condemned by it, and from that condemnation he can never be acquitted by the law. If it be impo&s;&s;ible that any &s;inner be &s;aved by that law, then on the footing of that law, every &s;inner mu&s;t be excluded from &s;alvation.</P>
<P>BUT this law is "a perfect rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s." Therefore perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, or &s;trict di&s;tributive ju&s;|tice, will never admit of the &s;alvation of any &s;inner; but every &s;inner ju&s;tly de&s;erves to be endle&s;sly excluded from &s;alvation.&mdash;Again, a puni&s;hment which &s;atisfies ju&s;tice, is one which is perfectly ju&s;t and de&s;erved by the &s;inner.
<PB N="295" REF="022478_0300_0FB92C53F6D2DDC8">
Therefore, if the &s;inner be puni&s;hed according to his de|&s;ert, he can never be &s;aved.&mdash;But both the &s;criptures and Dr. C. hold, that the damned will be puni&s;hed according to their de&s;erts; therefore they will never be &s;aved.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now fini&s;hed a work which has been attended with con&s;iderable labour to me, and with &s;ome to the reader who has peru&s;ed the whole. I am &s;en&s;ible that con|trover&s;ial writers often mi&s;under&s;tand each other, and therefore often &s;pend their own time and labour, and the time of their readers for nought. I have been aware of the danger of this, and have endeavoured to my utmo&s;t to avoid it: how &s;ucce&s;sfully, mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted. I have often wi&s;hed for an opportunity of conver&s;ation with &s;ome &s;en&s;ible and thorough believer in Dr. C's &s;cheme, that I might obtain explanation of &s;ome things, to me un|accountable. But I have not been favoured with &s;uch an opportunity. I have endeavoured to meet the Doctor's chief arguments, and not to carp at particulars which are of no importance to the &s;cheme, and have not de&s;ignedly &s;hunned any argument which appeared to me to be import|ant, and not implied in other arguments particularly noticed. I hope that whoever &s;hall undertake the confu|tation of what is now offered to the public, will treat it with the &s;ame candour. In a work of this length, and on a &s;ubject of &s;uch intricacy, it would be &s;trange indeed if there were not &s;ome &s;lips which would give advantage to an an|tagoni&s;t; yet tho&s;e &s;lips may not affect the main que&s;tion. If any man &s;hall write to point out &s;uch errata, it will hardly be worth while for me to trouble either my&s;elf or the world with a reply. But if any gentleman will can|didly point out the fallacy of the main arguments, on which I have re&s;ted what I fully believe to be truth; however I may be affected by it, I doubt not but that the public will have the candour ingenuou&s;ly to acknowledge it. If on the contrary his reply &s;hall con&s;i&s;t chiefly of declamation and warm addre&s;&s;es to the pa&s;&s;ions and imaginations of
<PB N="296" REF="022478_0301_0FB92C5634FA87D0">
mankind, pathetical and frightful repre&s;entations of the torments of the damned, interlarded with &s;arca&s;tic fleers and other e&s;&s;ays at wit; I doubt not the &s;ame candid pub|lic will properly notice it, and draw an inference not very favourable to the cau&s;e which is to be &s;upported by &s;uch auxillaries. Such artifices are unworthy of theologians, philo&s;ophers and any inquirers after truth.&mdash;I hope whoever undertakes a reply, will tell us what puni&s;hment &s;in ju&s;tly de&s;erves; what is the penalty of the moral law; or that cur&s;e of the law from which Chri&s;t hath re|deemed us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. C. explains Gal. III, <HI>10,</HI> to mean the cur&s;e of the moral law, or the law under which all men are; <HI>12</HI> Sermons, p. <HI>13.</HI></NOTE> I hope he will further inform us whether all men &s;hall be &s;aved in the way of forgivene&s;s. If they be, he will reconcile that mode of the &s;alvation of all men with tho&s;e declarations of &s;cripture which a&s;&s;ert, that the wicked &s;hall be puni&s;hed according to their works, &s;hall have judgment without mercy, and &s;hall pay the uttermo&s;t farthing. If it &s;hall be his opinion, that the damned will be puni&s;hed ac|cording to their demerits, and then be &s;aved without for|givene&s;s, it is to be hoped he will reconcile this idea with the whole New Te&s;tament, which every where repre&s;ents, that all who are &s;aved, are &s;aved in the way of forgivene&s;s. If he &s;hall hold, that <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>eternal,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>forever,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>forever and ever,</HI> generally in the &s;cripture mean a limited duration, let him point out the in&s;tances of that u&s;e of them, that they may be com|pared with tho&s;e in&s;tances in which they are u&s;ed in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e.&mdash;But I need not enumerate the various particulars, which ought to be minutely and di&s;tinctly con|&s;idered, in a candid and judicious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this impor|tant que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I HAVE no apprehen&s;ion, that the doctrine of endle&s;s puni&s;hment will &s;uffer at all by a thorough di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. In the cour&s;e of the di&s;qui&s;ition many may be perverted to fatal error; yet the final re&s;ult will be the more clear elu|cidation of the truth. However
<Q>many may run to and fro, yet knowledge &s;hall be increa&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>FINALLY, if any man, after a careful peru&s;al of what has been, or may be offered, on both &s;ides of this im|portant
<PB N="297" REF="022478_0302_0FB92C58424851F0">
que&s;tion, &s;hall be in doubt on which &s;ide the truth lies; it will certainly be mo&s;t prudent and &s;afe for him to act as he would, if he fully believed endle&s;s puni&s;hment; it will be mo&s;t prudent and &s;afe for him to yield a cordial compliance with the go&s;pel, in repentance, faith and obe|dience. Then he will be &s;afe on either &s;uppo&s;ition. But if he tru&s;t to the flattering doctrine, that all are finally to be &s;aved, and in this pre&s;umption &s;hall neglect the go&s;pel, its invitations and requirements; and it &s;hall finally prove, that that doctrine is a mere imagination of men; alas! he is lo&s;t; irrecoverably lo&s;t: while tho&s;e who receive the go&s;pel with "the obedience of faith," &s;hall through the blood of atonement,
<Q>have right to the tree of life, and &s;hall enter in through the gates into the City.</Q></P>

<Q>There will be different degrees of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, <HI>in proportion to their different con|duct and behaviour in this world.</HI> As nothing is <HI>ju&s;ter</HI> and more <HI>equitable</HI> in it&s;elf, &s;o nothing is clearer and more demon&s;trable from &s;cripture.

<Q>It mu&s;t be then admitted, that God hath threatened everla&s;ting mi&s;ery to the wicked, as plainly and po&s;itively as he hath promi&s;ed everla&s;ting happine&s;s to the righteous.

(Ezek. XVIII. 29.) Are not my ways equal? Are not your ways unequal, &s;aith the Lord? You cannot then complain of inju&s;tice, for the rewards and puni&s;hments are equal: and it was really nece&s;&s;ary, that the&s;e rewards and puni&s;hments &s;hould be everla&s;ting.</Q>

But why is he not obliged to perform the one as well as the other? His threatenings are never, like tho&s;e of men, made ra&s;hly, never founded in pa&s;&s;ion or caprice, that it &s;hould be better not to execute, than execute them. &mdash;If God will not execute as well as threaten, why doth he threaten at all?&mdash;Is it not more &s;uitable to the character of a God of truth, and becoming the &s;im|plicity and &s;incerity of a divine revelation, to declare the truth, and nothing but the truth, and leave it to work upon men as it can, rather than denounce in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner what was never intended, and ne|ver &s;hall come to pa&s;s, and &s;o endeavour to alarm them with fal&s;e fears, and to work upon them with fal&s;e per|&s;ua&s;ions, which have nothing to an&s;wer them?</Q>

<P>ON the&s;e quotations it may be remarked, that the Bi|&s;hop plainly held, that endle&s;s mi&s;ery is threatened; for
<PB N="300" REF="022478_0305_0FB92C60C4470820">
he always u&s;es the word <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e, and believed this to be the &s;criptural &s;en&s;e of it, when applied to future puni&s;hment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See P. 355.</NOTE> He al&s;o rejected the doc|trine of annihilation.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See P. 349.</NOTE> Now then his opinion was either, that endle&s;s mi&s;ery is unconditionally threatened to all who die impenitent; or that it is threatened to them on condi|tion of their continued impenitence in the future world. If it be threatened unconditionally, it follows, (1) That endle&s;s mi&s;ery is the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of the &s;ins committed in this life. For who will pretend, that God hath made a law, which contains an unju&s;t penalty? This would be equally incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine moral rectitude, as to make a law containing unju&s;t or unrea&s;onable precepts; or to execute the unju&s;t penalty. But if this were the opi|nion of the Bi&s;hop, to be con&s;i&s;tent he mu&s;t have given up the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation, to e&s;tabli&s;h which he wrote his Di&s;&s;ertation.

For if God fore&s;ee that the endle&s;s mi&s;ery of a man will be &s;ub&s;ervient to the general good; there is nothing contrariant to the divine nature, to be&s;tow exi&s;tence upon him, though he foreknow that he will &s;in, that he will de&s;erve endle&s;s mi|&s;ery, and that his de&s;tiny will terminate in wretchedne&s;s without recovery.</P>
<P>WE find that there are in fact temporary mi&s;eries in the world. On what principle can the&s;e be reconciled with the divine attributes? If it be an&s;wered, on the &s;ole prin|ciple, that they will i&s;&s;ue in the per&s;onal good of the pa|tients; the reply is, (1.) That this will be fact wants proof. It is by no means evident, that God aims at the per&s;onal good of every individual in all his di&s;pen&s;ations, however di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; it is not evident that the inhabitants of the old world, of Sodom and Gomorrah, &amp;c. are more happy in the whole of their exi&s;tence, than if they had li|ved and died like other men.&mdash;(2.) E&s;pecially it is not evident, that all the &s;in and wickedne&s;s which any man commits will finally make him a more happy man, than he would have been, if he had committed no &s;in. If God may without a view to promote the per&s;onal good of a man, permit him to fall into &s;in, why may he not without a view

to the &s;ame object, puni&s;h him for that &s;in?

The principle now under con&s;ideration implies that there is not now nor ever has been in the univer&s;e, any thing which on the whole is a real evil to any man con&s;idered in his individual capa|city: that no man ever was or ever will be the &s;ubject of any cur&s;e, or any calamity which any man, with a view to his own happine&s;s only, &s;hould wi&s;h to avoid.</P>
<P>OR if temporary calamities be reconciled with the di|vine attributes on this principle, that they are &s;ub&s;ervient to the general good; on the &s;ame principle we reconcile with the divine attributes, the endle&s;s mi&s;ery of the damned.&mdash;This whole argument depends on the &s;uppo|&s;ition, that the final mi&s;ery of any &s;inner cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ub&s;er|vient to the general good.

<P>HE &s;eems to hold, that all mankind were from eternity &s;o united to Chri&s;t, that he and they make properly one whole or complex per&s;on. But it is extremely difficult to determine with preci&s;ion what his ideas were. I &s;hall therefore make &s;everal quotations from him, and &s;ubjoin &s;uch remarks as appear pertinent.
<Q>It doth not appear how God&mdash;could puni&s;h &s;in upon Chri&s;t, without the concurrence of righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth: nor can this concurrence be proved, without union between Chri&s;t and tho&s;e, for whom he endured the cro&s;s&mdash;becau&s;e contrary to truth, which declareth, that every man &s;hall die for <HI>his own</HI> &s;in.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 3.</NOTE>&mdash;
<Q>Such an union between Chri&s;t and his church, as gives him the right of redemp|tion, and brings him under that character, which is ob|noxious to puni&s;hment, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</Q>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>&mdash;
<Q>Without the con&s;ideration of union, where is the ju&s;tice of charging the black rebellion and crying guilt of man, upon the pure and &s;potle&s;s head of Je&s;us.</Q>
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 4.</NOTE>
<Q>Sin is&mdash;a crime&mdash;only atoned for&mdash;by the death, yea, the <HI>eternal</HI> death of the &s;inner: which ju&s;tice mu&s;t inflict before it can be properly &s;atisfied; nor can it po&s;&s;ibly admit of a &s;urety here; becau&s;e it can only puni&s;h him, whom it fir&s;t finds guilty; and not by reckoning him, to be what he is not, according to human quibbles, but
<PB N="306" REF="022478_0311_0FB92C6A6F8ED1E8">
according to, artle&s;s, rea&s;onable, divine equity; which can only declare &s;uch guilty, on whom the fault is found, and can only find the fault on &s;uch who have committed it. We only committed the fault; upon us only can it be found. Therefore, without &s;uch an union between Chri&s;t and us, as expo&s;es us in his per&s;on, to judgment and condemnation, the harmony of the divine perfecti|ons doth not appear in the things which he &s;uffered, be|cau&s;e contrary to truth and ju&s;tice.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 4.</NOTE> He largely illu&s;|trates this union between Chri&s;t and his church, by the union between the head and members in the natural bo|dy, and adds,
<Q>The union and harmony of the body renders it equitable to puni&s;h and cha&s;ti&s;e the whole bo|dy in one member, for its offence in another. Becau&s;e if one member &s;uffer, all the members &s;uffer with it. As the union of the body makes it equitable to puni&s;h the head, for the offence of the other members; with like equity do the members participate with the head, in all its honors and glory. Thus the crowning of the head, crowns the whole man, and every member partakes of the honor.</Q></P>
<P>THESE quotations may &s;erve to give an idea of the uni|on between Chri&s;t and mankind, for which Mr. Relly pleads. I now proceed to the following remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT appears by the foregoing quotations, that Relly held &s;uch an union between Chri&s;t and his church, that he upon the ground of ju&s;tice became liable to puni&s;hment on account of their &s;ins. Otherwi&s;e the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t were both unju&s;t and contrary to truth: unju&s;t, as he did not de&s;erve them, contrary to truth as the divine declara|tion is "The &s;oul that &s;inneth &s;hall die."&mdash;But if this be true, if Chri&s;t was liable to puni&s;hment on the ground of ju&s;tice, di&s;tributive ju&s;tice; then Chri&s;t de&s;erved death as much as the &s;inner. In his &s;ufferings the Father did but treat him according to his own character and conduct: he did but cau&s;e him to eat the fruit of his own ways and to be filled with his own devices: and no more thanks or prai&s;e are due to Chri&s;t on account of his &s;ufferings, than are due to the damned &s;inner, on account of his enduring the pains of hell.&mdash;Be&s;ide; how contrary is this to the &s;crip|ture! That declares, that
<Q>Chri&s;t &s;uffered the <HI>ju&s;t</HI> for the unju&s;t;</Q>
that
<Q>he was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled,
<PB N="307" REF="022478_0312_0FB92C6BECD96E18">
and &s;eparate from &s;inners;</Q>
That
<Q>he did no &s;in, nei|ther was guile found in his mouth.</Q>
&mdash;Now if Chri&s;t was a "character obnoxious to puni&s;hment" on the foot of di&s;tributive ju&s;tice, he was very far from being <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> and from being <HI>holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled</HI>; he <HI>did &s;in,</HI> and <HI>guile was found</HI> in his mouth. Indeed this is no more than Rel|ly a&s;&s;erts in the above quotations, when he &s;ays,
<Q>that ju&s;|tice can only puni&s;h him whom it finds guilty; not by reckoning him what he is not, but according to artle&s;s divine equity, which can only find the fault on &s;uch as have committed it.</Q>
Therefore, according to this, Chri&s;t as one with &s;inners, committed the fault, and there|fore de&s;ervedly &s;uffered for it.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be granted, that Chri&s;t did not him&s;elf com|mit the fault or &s;in, for which he &s;uffered, but that by a wi&s;e, &s;overeign, divine con&s;titution, to which he him&s;elf fully con&s;ented, he &s;uffered for the &s;ins of others; this would be to give up all, and to acknowledge, that Chri&s;t did not &s;uffer for &s;in on the footing of di&s;tributive ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT appears by the &s;ame quotations, that Relly was not of the opinion, that Chri&s;t &s;uffered in con&s;equence of the imputation of &s;in to him, or becau&s;e he was the &s;urety of his church: but on the ground of his proper union with men. This appears by the&s;e words:
<Q>Sin is a crime only atoned for by death, which ju&s;tice mu&s;t inflict; nor can it po&s;&s;ibly admit of a <HI>&s;urety</HI> here: becau&s;e it can only puni&s;h him whom it fir&s;t finds guilty: and not by reckoning him to be what he is not.</Q>
Yet he holds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 41.</NOTE> that Chri&s;t &s;uffered on the &s;ole ground of <HI>imputation.</HI> His words are,
<Q>The doctrine of union, which repre&s;ents Je&s;us &s;uffering under the character of the &s;inner, doth not &s;uppo&s;e him &s;uch in his own particular per&s;on; nay &s;trongly witne&s;&s;eth the contrary, and re&s;pects him only thus by &s;uch an <HI>imputation</HI> as is ju&s;t and true.</Q>
&mdash;If then the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t do not &s;uppo&s;e him to be a &s;in|ner "in his own particular per&s;on;" how can this be re|conciled with what is quoted above from page 3d, in which he argues, that unle&s;s Chri&s;t be one with tho&s;e for whom he died, his &s;ufferings cannot be reconciled with the &s;crip|ture, which declares that every man &s;hall die for <HI>his own</HI> &s;in? Or with what is quoted from page 4th which declares,
<PB N="308" REF="022478_0313_0FB92C731B879798">
that ju&s;tice does not admit of a <HI>&s;urety,</HI> or of reckoning Chri&s;t to be what he is not?</P>
<P N="3">3. IT further appears by the &s;ame quotations, that Relly con&s;iders Chri&s;t and mankind, as one, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that the head and members in the natural body are one. If this be &s;o, then we are no more indebted to Chri&s;t for our redemption, than a man's hands are indebted to his head for inventing means for his livelihood; or his head is indebted to his hands for applying tho&s;e means.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT al&s;o appears, that on this plan Chri&s;t is now &s;uf|fering, and will without end &s;uffer, an <HI>eternal death.</HI> Ob|&s;erve the quotation from page 4th,
<Q>Sin is a crime only atoned for by the death, yea the <HI>eternal death</HI> of the <HI>&s;in|ner</HI>; which ju&s;tice mu&s;t inflict, before it can be properly &s;atisfied: nor can it po&s;&s;ibly admit of a <HI>&s;urety</HI> here; be|cau&s;e it can only puni&s;h him whom it fir&s;t finds guilty; and not by reckoning him to be what he is not, accord|ing to human quibbles, but according to divine equity, which can only declare &s;uch guilty on whom the fault is found, and can only find the fault on &s;uch who have committed it.</Q>
The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions manife&s;tly declare, (1) That Chri&s;t is a &s;inner, and committed the &s;in or fault for which he &s;uffered, and that not by <HI>imputation</HI> and as the <HI>&s;urety</HI> of his people, but really and literally.&mdash;(2) That &s;in can be atoned for by the &s;uffering of <HI>eternal death</HI> only. This and this only will properly &s;atisfy ju&s;tice.&mdash;(3) That therefore, as Chri&s;t is the propitiation for our &s;ins, he is now, and will without end, be &s;uffering <HI>eternal death.</HI></P>

<P>ON the&s;e quotations it may be remarked,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT according to this plan, the mo&s;t <HI>exact</HI> and <HI>ri|gorous ju&s;tice, divine</HI> ju&s;tice, <HI>infinite</HI> ju&s;tice, admits that a &s;in|ner be made to &s;uffer till he repents, and no further. Such a puni&s;hment as this, is
<Q>exactly proportioned both in de|gree and duration, to the nature and extent of the crimes</Q>
of the &s;inner. This then is the utmo&s;t which the divine law will admit: this is the true <HI>cur&s;e</HI> of the di|vine law; even that cur&s;e from which Chri&s;t hath redeem|ed us.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="310" REF="022478_0315_0FB92C77EFDF3020">2. THIS puni&s;hment inflicted on any &s;inner, utterly pre|cludes all pardon, forgivene&s;s and mercy. How is he for|given, who &s;uffers to the utmo&s;t extent of ju&s;tice? How is any &s;paring mercy exerci&s;ed toward him, on whom the cur&s;e of the law is fully executed?&mdash;Yet M. Petitpier|re con&s;tantly holds, that the &s;alvation of &s;inners is effected in the way of <HI>mercy, pardon</HI> and <HI>forgivene&s;s.</HI> Thus, &s;peak|ing of the divine goodne&s;s, he &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 6.</NOTE>
<Q>Are men mi&s;era|ble?

&mdash;
<Q>How &s;triking, how awful, and at the &s;ame time how <HI>merciful,</HI> are the repre&s;entations of future torments!</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 109.</NOTE>&mdash;
<Q>He will con&s;tantly <HI>pardon,</HI> and receive into favour the &s;incerely penitent offender. Repentance appea&s;es divine anger and di&s;arms its ju&s;tice, becau&s;e it accompli&s;hes the end infinite goodne&s;s has in view, even when arrayed in the awful maje&s;ty of <HI>aveng|ing ju&s;tice</HI>; which was &s;evere, becau&s;e the moral &s;tate of the &s;inner required &s;uch di&s;cipline; and which when that &s;tate is rever&s;ed by conver&s;ion&mdash;will have nothing to be&s;tow &s;uitable to it, but the delightful manife&s;tations of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>forgivene&s;s.</HI></Q>
It &s;eems then, that not on|ly is <HI>ju&s;tice &s;atisfied</HI> by the repentance of the &s;inner; but <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> even <HI>the awful maje&s;ty of avenging ju&s;tice,</HI> will be|&s;tow <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>forgivene&s;s.</HI> But how forgivene&s;s can be an act of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> and e&s;pecially an act of <HI>avenging</HI> ju&s;tice, remains to be explained.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE puni&s;hment now under con&s;ideration, is utterly in|con&s;i&s;tent with redemption by Chri&s;t. How are they redeem|ed or delivered from the cur&s;e of the law, who in their own per&s;ons &s;uffer that cur&s;e? And if Chri&s;t &s;hould deliver them from it, he would deprive them of an ine&s;timable benefit.</P>
<P N="4">4. IF
<Q><HI>infinite ju&s;tice</HI> adapts with the mo&s;t perfect and minute detail, the re&s;pective &s;uitablene&s;s of his dealings to our moral &s;tate, and con&s;equently to our wants, throughout the whole of our exi&s;tence;</Q>
then what is <HI>goodne&s;s</HI>? and how is it di&s;tingui&s;hed from ju&s;tice? What more kind and favorable than this can goodne&s;s, the divine goodne&s;s, infinite and incomprehen&s;ible goodne&s;s, do for us? According to this definition of <HI>infinite ju&s;tice,</HI> the in|&s;titutions,
<PB N="311" REF="022478_0316_0FB92C796F871958">
promi&s;es and &s;cheme of the go&s;pel, nay the un|&s;peakable gift of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, are mere communications of ju&s;tice, and not of goodne&s;s and grace: and according to the &s;ame definition there never has been, and never can be, any benefit granted by the Deity to any of his creatures, which is any more than a fruit of mere ju&s;tice, and which may be withholden con&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice: and all that God ever has done, and ever will or can do, for the hap|pine&s;s of his creatures, is barely &s;ufficient to &s;ave his cha|racter from a well grounded charge of inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>BUT I mean not to dwell on this &s;ubject: I do but hint the&s;e particular's. It would be an infinite labour to point out the endle&s;s ab&s;urdities of this &s;cheme of ju&s;tice and pu|ni&s;hment. I have con&s;idered the point more largely in Chap. II, to which I beg leave to refer the reader.</P>
<P>THE other fundamental principle of this book is, That the happine&s;s of every individual creature is nece&s;&s;ary to the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem. This idea is expre&s;|&s;ed in various pa&s;&s;ages, particularly in the following,
<Q>It is impo&s;&s;ible the Divine Being &s;hould ever di&s;pen&s;e any evil in this world, or in the world to come; which is not even to the individuals an actual exerci&s;e of perfect goodne&s;s.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 220.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND that this is nece&s;&s;arily implied in the &s;cheme of this author, and of all others who argue univer&s;al &s;alva|tion from the divine perfections, without re&s;pect to the a|tonement, mu&s;t be manife&s;t upon the &s;lighte&s;t reflection. Goodne&s;s will always &s;eek the greate&s;t good or happine&s;s of intelligent beings. And that the happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem is a greater good than the happine&s;s of any individual or individuals of that &s;y&s;tem, is a &s;elf evident propo&s;ition. Therefore goodne&s;s will never &s;eek the happine&s;s of any individuals, &s;o as to dimini&s;h the happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem: for this would be not to &s;eek the advancement of happine&s;s on the whole, but the diminution of it. If therefore the divine goodne&s;s &s;eeks the final happine&s;s of every intelli|gent creature, it mu&s;t be becau&s;e the happine&s;s of every creature promotes and is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem. If it be not nece&s;&s;ary to the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem, it is no object to goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>CONCERNING this principle the following &s;trictures are &s;ugge&s;ted:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="312" REF="022478_0317_0FB92C7BC5C36338">1. THE truth of it is by no means evident.&mdash;Indeed M <HI>Petitpierre</HI> &s;uppo&s;es the ab&s;urdity of the contrary po|&s;ition to be exceedingly clear, and therefore indulges him|&s;elf in the following ardent effu&s;ion:
<Q>Can we &s;uppo&s;e that intelligent creatures capable by their nature of per|fection and felicity, would be unable to attain to this glo|rious de&s;tination, unle&s;s at the &s;ame time a number of intelligent beings exi&s;ted in eternal mi&s;ery? Among creatures of the &s;ame nature, thence capable of the &s;ame happine&s;s; mu&s;t a part be made happy at the expence of a con&s;iderable portion devoted to endle&s;s mi&s;ery and de&s;pair? Cannot a Being infinitely perfect and happy communicate beatitude to his intelligent offspring, on other and more favourable terms? Can he not be to &s;ome the inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of happine&s;s; unle&s;s he is to others the never-failing &s;ource of mi&s;ery? But let us cea&s;e to heap contradiction on contradiction, horror up|on horror, and end this di&s;agreeable di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</Q>
&mdash; M. P&mdash;rre did not reflect, that if this pa&s;&s;age contain any argument, it is equally forcible again&s;t the evils which <HI>in fact</HI> take place in this world, as again&s;t the puni&s;hments of the future: and that the pa&s;&s;age may be retorted thus; Can we &s;uppo&s;e that intelligent creatures capable by nature of peace, liberty, and all the enjoyments of human &s;ociety, would be unable to attain to this excellent de&s;tination, un|le&s;s at the &s;ame time a number of intelligent beings were rendered mi&s;erable by fines, confi&s;cations, ignominy, pri|&s;ons, chains, &s;tripes and the gallows? Among creatures of the &s;ame nature, thence capable of the &s;ame happine&s;s; mu&s;t a part be made &s;afe and happy at the expence of a con&s;iderable portion devoted to mi&s;ery and de&s;pair, in the ways ju&s;t mentioned? Cannot a being infinitely perfect and happy communicate beatitude to his intelligent off|&s;pring on other and more favourable terms? Can he not be to &s;ome the &s;ource of peace, &s;afety, liberty and hap|pine&s;s; unle&s;s he be to others the &s;ource of mi&s;ery? But let us cea&s;e to heap contradiction on contradiction, horror upon horror, and end this di&s;agreeable di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay that God can convert the wicked, and without endle&s;s impri&s;onment and puni&s;hment, prevent the mi&s;chief which they would do to the &s;y&s;tem, affords no &s;atisfaction. So God can convert the wicked in this world, and prevent all the mi&s;chief which they do here. The que&s;tion is not,
<PB N="313" REF="022478_0318_0FB92C7D2EB4B210">
what God has power to do, but what he will in fact do; and what he may &s;ee fit to permit others to do.</P>
<P>M. P&mdash;rre proceeds to argue again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility, that the mi&s;ery of &s;ome intelligent creatures &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of the re&s;t, and urges that in&s;tead of this, it would &s;ubvert their happine&s;s; becau&s;e the inhabitants of heaven are &s;o full of benevolence and compa&s;&s;ion, that they cannot be happy, while numbers of their fellow creatures are mi&s;erable; and e&s;pecially becau&s;e it mu&s;t be &s;till more painful to them, to know that the eternal &s;ufferings of tho&s;e their fellow creatures, were nece&s;&s;ary to their own happi|ne&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 215, &amp;c.</NOTE>&mdash;But the&s;e ob&s;ervations are no more reconcileable with fact and with experience, than tho&s;e which I ju&s;t now quoted from the &s;ame author. Are the be&s;t of men in this world, &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate, that they cannot be happy &s;o long as thieves and robbers are confined in work-hou&s;es and pri&s;ons, and murderers die on gibbets? And do they di&s;dain to enjoy their lives, their liberty, their peace and their property, unle&s;s they can be &s;ecured in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, on terms le&s;s ignominious and painful to &s;ome of their fellow creatures?</P>
<P>SUCH are the arguments by which M. P&mdash;rre endea|vours to prove, that the mi&s;ery of &s;ome men cannot be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the greate&s;t good of the &s;y&s;tem. If the&s;e argu|ments be not convincing, it is in vain to expect convincing evidence of the propo&s;ition now under con&s;ideration, from M. P&mdash;rre.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE reader has doutle&s;s taken notice that the propo|&s;ition now under con&s;ideration implies, not only that end|le&s;s mi&s;ery, but any temporary calamity cannot be inflicted on an individual, con&s;i&s;tently with the good of the whole, unle&s;s that temporary calamity be &s;ub&s;ervient to his per&s;on|al good. Ob&s;erve the words quoted above,
<Q>It is im|po&s;&s;ible the Divine Being &s;hould ever di&s;pen&s;e any evil <HI>in this world</HI> or in the world to come, which is not even <HI>to the individuals,</HI> an act of perfect goodne&s;s.</Q>
&mdash;Then all evils and calamities which have ever exi&s;ted, or do ex|i&s;t, or ever will exi&s;t, in this world, as well as the future, are no real evils, no <HI>cur&s;e</HI> to the patients them&s;elves; but they are all &s;o many benefits and <HI>ble&s;&s;ings</HI> to them. The de&s;truction of the old world, of Sodom, &amp;c, were real ble&s;&s;ings to the patients per&s;onally. But how does this ap|pear?
<PB N="314" REF="022478_0319_0FB92C7EB88BB928">
They certainly did not in this world operate for the good of the patients; and how does it appear, that they will operate for their good in the future world? To a&s;&s;ert this without a&s;&s;igning a rea&s;on, is impertinent.&mdash;Be&s;ide; on this hypothe&s;is, there is no &s;uch thing as any <HI>cur&s;e</HI> either in this world or the future; and there is no difference be|tween a <HI>cur&s;e</HI> and a <HI>ble&s;&s;ing.</HI> What then &s;hall we make of the &s;criptures, which &s;peak abundantly of cur&s;es, and con|&s;tantly di&s;tingui&s;h between cur&s;es and ble&s;&s;ings?</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS, which I have called the &s;econd fundamental principle of this author, is in reality not di&s;tinct from the fir&s;t.&mdash;If the good or happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem require the happine&s;s of every individual, it &s;urely cannot require the mi&s;ery of any individual: and if it do not require his mi&s;ery, it is not con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, that he &s;hould be made mi&s;erable by puni&s;hment; or it is not con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice that he be puni&s;hed any further than is &s;ub&s;ervient to his own per&s;onal happine&s;s.&mdash;No puni&s;hment is con|&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, which in view of the criminal alone, without re&s;pect to a &s;ub&s;titute, or an atonement, the pub|lic good does not require.</P>
<P>SO that the whole &s;y&s;tem of this author depends on this &s;ingle principle, That it is not con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, to puni&s;h a &s;inner any further, than is &s;ub&s;ervient to his own per&s;onal good: and this principle, as I have endeavoured to &s;how in Chap. II, and VIII, really comes to this, <HI>Whether &s;in be a moral evil.</HI> Moral evil is in its own nature odi|ous, and ju&s;tly the object of divine di&s;approbation, and of the manife&s;tation of di&s;approbation, whether &s;uch manife&s;|tation of di&s;approbation be &s;ub&s;ervient to the per&s;onal good of the &s;inner or not. But the manife&s;tation of divine di&s;|approbation is puni&s;hment. Therefore moral evil may ju&s;t|ly be puni&s;hed, whether &s;uch puni&s;hment be &s;ub&s;ervient to the per&s;onal good of the &s;inner or not. But as &s;in accor|ding to the principle now under con&s;ideration, cannot be ju&s;tly puni&s;hed any further than is &s;ub&s;ervient to the per|&s;onal good of the &s;inner, of cour&s;e it is no moral evil.</P>
<P>AGAIN; moral evil in its own nature impairs the good of the moral &s;y&s;tem. Therefore God as a friend to that &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, and may ju&s;tly di&s;approve it, and manife&s;t his di&s;approbation, though it may not tend to the per&s;onal good of the &s;inner. But this manife&s;tation of di|vine di&s;approbation is puni&s;hment, and ju&s;t puni&s;hment.
<PB N="315" REF="022478_0320_0FB92C86B2C256C8">
But &s;in, according to the principle now under con&s;iderati|on, cannot ju&s;tly be thus puni&s;hed. Therefore &s;in is not, according to this principle, a moral evil.</P>
<P>IF therefore M. P&mdash;rre believe, that &s;in is a moral evil, and in its own nature de&s;erves the divine abhorrence, he mu&s;t, to be con&s;i&s;tent, give up his whole &s;y&s;tem of uni|ver&s;al &s;alvation.</P>
<P>AS the book now before us is a later publication than Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s; and as the Doctor's book, which at its fir&s;t appearance was &s;o highly extolled for deep learning and demon&s;trative rea&s;oning, did not convert the world; the zealots for univer&s;ali&s;m have been lavi&s;h of their encomiums on this work of Petitpierre, and as it &s;eems, have great ex|pectations from it. However, it requires no &s;pirit of pro|phecy to fore&s;ee, that this book will not effect more nume|rous conver&s;ions, than that of Dr. C. The author has a good talent at <HI>declamation</HI>; and tho&s;e who are already per|&s;uaded of the truth of his &s;y&s;tem, may be much comforted by his pathetic repre&s;entations of the divine goodne&s;s and univer&s;al happine&s;s. But tho&s;e who are doubtful, and wi&s;h to &s;ee a con&s;i&s;tent &s;y&s;tem e&s;tabli&s;hed on the broad ba|&s;is of rea&s;on and revelation, will doubtle&s;s find them&s;elves nece&s;&s;itated to pro&s;ecute their inquiries further, than M. <HI>Petitpierre</HI> will lead them.</P>
