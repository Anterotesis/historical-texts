<HEAD>A TESTIMONY from the MONTHLY-MEETING of WITHAM, in ESSEX, CONCERNING JOHN GRIFFITH, dec.</HEAD>
<P>THE character of this our well beloved Friend being &s;o generally known, we e&s;teem it unnece&s;&s;ary to extend our Te&s;timo|ny concerning him, further than the time of his arrival and re&s;idence among&s;t us.</P>
<P>In the year 1747, being a member of the monthly-meeting of Darby, Che&s;ter-coun|ty, in Penn&s;ylvania, he was concerned to vi&s;it the churches in Great-Britain and Ire|land; during which engagement his mind was impre&s;&s;ed with appehen&s;ion of duty to &s;ettle in this nation; the importance where|of was attended with earne&s;t &s;upplication to the Lord, that he might be rightly di|rected therein; and, after deliberate con&s;ide|ration, finding the expediency of his remo|val clearly confirmed, he returned to Ame|rica, where, having &s;ettled his affairs, with the concurrence of his brethren, he removed to England; and entering into marriage-covenant with Frances Wyatt, of Chelm&s;|ford, became a member of this meeting; wherein, we tru&s;t, the fruits of his labour afford &s;ub&s;tantial evidence of able talents faithfully applied. Few were his companions zealou&s;ly concerned for the re&s;toration of good order, which rendered the ta&s;k more arduous: yet in regard to the exerci&s;e of
<PB N="ii" REF="016793_0003_0F9E317D73783560">
di&s;cipline, compared with the &s;tate in which he found it, con&s;iderable regulation hath been effected.</P>
<P>His gift was eminently adapted to &s;ervice: in mini&s;try &s;ound, powerful, and clear; in di&s;cipline, diligent and judicious; &s;earch|ing impartially into the cau&s;es whence the circulation of life was ob&s;tructed, which operative care, di&s;turbing the fal&s;e re&s;t of lukewarm profe&s;&s;ors, hath, at times, ex|cited their di&s;plea&s;ure; yet being mercifully pre&s;erved from the &s;pots of the world, and endued with authority to &s;peak feelingly to the &s;tates of his hearers, in him that proverb was remarkably verified,
<Q>When a man's ways plea&s;e the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</Q></P>
<P>In doubtful ca&s;es, he manife&s;ted an ex|emplary tenderne&s;s and forbearance, parti|cularly re&s;pecting &s;uch as appeared pre&s;ump|tuous in launching into religious engage|ments above their qualification, being di&s;|po&s;ed to afford full opportunity for trial; ob&s;erving, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, it would be mo&s;t acceptable, that deluded per&s;ons per|ceived their error by its effects: but when thoroughly convinced of un&s;oundne&s;s, he faithfully di&s;charged the duty of an elder, in the application of plain-dealing, which, indeed, was his peculiar talent; yet &s;o tem+pered with di&s;cretion, both in mini&s;try and di&s;cipline, that we believe few have filled the&s;e important &s;tations with more general approbation: nor were his amiable qualities
<PB N="iii" REF="016793_0004_0F9E317D87DCF850">
confined to the notice of our &s;ociety, having a large &s;hare in the e&s;teem of others, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e of his neigbourhood.</P>
<P>Much of his time was devoted to pub|lick &s;ervice: in con&s;equence whereof, a foreta&s;te of the reward promi&s;ed to them who per&s;evere in well-doing, proved his &s;ub&s;tantial &s;upport through a long cour&s;e of painful infirmity, being affected with an a&s;thma about fifteen years. At length the di&s;order, producing a drop&s;y, &s;trong|ly indicated his di&s;&s;olution near; yet in this condition, he continued about eight months: during which &s;ea&s;on of deep trial, the fruits of faithfulne&s;s were con&s;picuous: being, at intervals, favoured with &s;trength to &s;peak intelligibly, the frame of his mind appeared to be centered in &s;weet con&s;olation, which, in great mea&s;ure, overcame the &s;en&s;e of bodily pain, though evidently hard to bear.</P>
<P>His mental faculties &s;eemed rather en|larged in quickne&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility, having frequently to expre&s;s thankfulne&s;s and ad|miration, that during this &s;harp probation, infinite goodne&s;s had not &s;uffered his mind to be clouded, but continued to lift up the light of his countenance upon him; under the influence whereof, his &s;pirit was en|gaged to encourage tho&s;e pre&s;ent to faith|fulne&s;s, through the happy effect which he experienced at that awful period.</P>
<P>Divers who a&s;&s;i&s;ted during his illne&s;s, have declared, that his patience in &s;uffering, kind acknowledgment of their care, and in|&s;tructive admonitions, &s;o far alleviated their
<PB N="iv" REF="016793_0005_0F9E317E4B604310">
anxiety, occa&s;ioned by the &s;harpne&s;s of his conflict, that they e&s;teemed it a favour to attend him.</P>
<P>After a laborious winter, gradually de|clining, he quietly departed this life, the 17th of the 6th month, 1776, and was in|terred in friends burial-ground at Chelm&s;|ford, the 23d of the &s;ame; aged about 63 years; a mini&s;ter about 42 years.</P>

<HEAD>THE JOURNAL OF JOHN GRIFFITH.</HEAD>
<P>IT hath been much upon my mind (e&s;pecially of late) to write &s;omething by way of journal, of my life, travels, and experience in the gracious and merciful dealings of the Lord with me, through the cour&s;e of my pilgrimage in this world; to|gether with &s;ome remarks on the &s;tate of our &s;ociety in my time, inter&s;per&s;ed with divers ob&s;ervations relating to our conduct, in various &s;tations of life, but chiefly in a religious &s;en&s;e; to remain, when my body is laid in the du&s;t, a la&s;ting memorial and te&s;timony to the truth. And as the Lord &s;hall be plea&s;ed to open my under&s;tanding, I may al&s;o afford profitable way-marks to &s;ome weary travellers, who are &s;eeking a
<PB N="2" REF="016793_0007_0F9E317FE869FA50">
city that hath foundations, who&s;e builder and maker is God.</P>
<P>I was born on the 21&s;t day of the 5th month, 1713, in Radnor&s;hire, South Wales; being favoured with parents who had the &s;ub&s;tance of religion in them&s;elves, and were con&s;cientiou&s;ly concerned to train up their children in the fear of God. The names of my parents were John and Amy Griffith; my mother (as I re|member) was educated in &s;ociety with the people called Quakers, and a &s;teady valua|ble friend &s;he was; having at times, a few words, by way of te&s;timony, tenderly to drop in religious meetings, which were accept|able to friends. My father, as I have heard him relate, was convinced of the ble&s;&s;ed truth after he had arived to man's e&s;tate, and found it a great cro&s;s to join in &s;ociety with the de&s;pi&s;ed Quakers; he being the only one of the family, which was pretty large, that joined in &s;ociety with that peo|ple. But the Lord making hard things ea&s;y to him, he gave up, in earne&s;t, to the heavenly di&s;coveries, and, in proce&s;s of time, had a di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel of peace and &s;alvation committed to him; wherein he laboured, in the parts where he lived, with remarkable &s;incerity and up|rightne&s;s; being indeed a truly living mi|ni&s;ter, and an heavenly-minded man, as I well remember, though I left him when I was young, and never &s;aw him again. He
<PB N="3" REF="016793_0008_0F9E318086DE6C40">
fini&s;hed his cour&s;e in this world, on the 24th of the 2d month, in the year 1745; it is added in the regi&s;ter of the monthly-meeting to which he belonged, thus, viz.
<Q>He was a mini&s;ter many years, and left a good report behind him among all &s;orts of people.</Q>
He was a &s;erviceable in&s;trument in the Lord's hand again&s;t undue liberties, which were then creeping in; and was very deeply affected with the declining &s;tate of the church in tho&s;e parts (many having remo|ved to America) which &s;ince his decea&s;e are become almo&s;t a de&s;olation.</P>
<P>Having thus paid a &s;mall tribute, which I thought due, to the memory of my worthy parents, I &s;hall proceed to give an account of my &s;elf.</P>
<P>I was favoured with the heart-melting vi&s;itations of God's love, I think, when about &s;even or eight years old; and fre|quently experienced his name to be in the a&s;&s;emblies of his people as precious oint|ment poured forth; whereby my de&s;ires were greatly rai&s;ed to attend meetings for divine wor&s;hip. For although, like Samuel of old, I was as yet unacquainted with the voice of God, neither did I clearly under|&s;tand from whence that precious con&s;ola|tion, which I felt, came; yet, I well re|member &s;omething working powerfully in my tender weak mind, by way of oppo&s;ition to that &s;weet heavenly enjoyment, in order to deprive me thereof, by pre&s;enting to my
<PB N="4" REF="016793_0009_0F9E31831CD30358">
view &s;ome tran&s;itory delight, and by filling my mind with vain unprofitable, and &s;ome|times wicked and bla&s;phemous thoughts, which were a very great affliction to me. Then he, who was a liar from the begin|ning, would &s;ugge&s;t to my weak mind, that the only way to get over &s;uch unea&s;ine&s;s, was to give way to tho&s;e thoughts, and to be utterly regardle&s;s of what pa&s;&s;ed through my mind. I found the fle&s;h wanted ea&s;e, and to &s;ave its &s;elf; willingly joined here|in with the temptations of Santan, whereby I got a kind of pre&s;ent ea&s;e, but it was by &s;uch gratifications as tended to heap up wrath again&s;t the day of wrath, and the re|velation of the righteous judgments of God. So that, notwith&s;tanding the fal&s;e ea&s;e con|trived by my &s;oul's enemy, I did, at times, very &s;en&s;ibly feel, as I grew up, this peace di&s;turbed and broken by a &s;en&s;e of God's wrath, revealed from heaven again&s;t my un|righteou&s;ne&s;s; and great bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit I was often in, when the cha&s;tening of the Lord was upon me for &s;in. I would, at &s;uch times, enter into covenant with the Lord, promi&s;ing amendment; but as tho&s;e promi&s;es were made much in my own will, they were &s;oon broken, and that would in|crea&s;e the weight of my horror and di&s;|tre&s;s: the Lord, in infinite mercy, being plea&s;ed to find me out, and to plead with me as in the valley of deci&s;ion. In wri|ting this, my mind is greatly moved with
<PB N="5" REF="016793_0010_0F9E3184038F0A90">
pity and bowels of compa&s;&s;ion towards incon&s;iderate youth; who for the &s;ake of tri&s;ting vanities, &s;lighting their own mer|cies, are &s;ubjected to di&s;tre&s;s of mind: and the ca&s;e is &s;till wor&s;e, when by repeated di&s;|obedience and rebellion again&s;t God's un|merited grace, they have almo&s;t &s;tifled his divine witne&s;s in their own hearts, and go on with impunity; for an awakening time will come, &s;oon or late, which mu&s;t &s;trike all &s;uch with horror and amaze|ment. May it be in mercy!</P>
<P>My godly parents were very careful to pre|vent my falling into evil company; notwith|&s;tanding which, I frequently, without their knowledge, found &s;uch, and joined them in tho&s;e vanities which are incident to youth; and perhaps was not a whit behind any of them therein: yet in the cool of the day, I was &s;harply reproved for the &s;ame; nay &s;ometimes, in the very mid&s;t of my folly. But by this time I wanted to &s;ilence that pure witne&s;s again&s;t evil in my heart. Oh! I have often &s;ince, with deep reverence, thankfully admired the long-&s;uffering of a gracious God, in that he did not cut me off, when I wilfully re&s;i&s;ted the reproof of his in&s;truction, which is the way to life, becau&s;e I wanted my living in the vain plea|&s;ures of this peri&s;hing world.</P>
<P>When I was about the age of thirteen years, a friend who had lived &s;ome time in Penn&s;ylvania, being in our parts, and fre|quently
<PB N="6" REF="016793_0011_0F9E318552D51350">
at our hou&s;e, gave a very plea&s;ing account of that country. I having two uncles and one aunt there, &s;ome of whom had before written to encourage our going over thither, my inclination grew very &s;trong to go; though my parents, e&s;pecially my father, was at fir&s;t very much again&s;t it. But I was as one immoveably bent for going; which when my parents &s;aw, and that an elder brother inclined to go with me, they at length con&s;ented thereunto, and procured a certificate of our being in unity with Friends. There being a family of Friends, out of the compa&s;s of our month|ly meeting, al&s;o going over in the &s;ame &s;hip, we were delivered under their care, and in the year 1726, we embarked at Mil|ford-Haven, on board the Con&s;tantine gal|ley of Bri&s;tol, Edward Foy ma&s;ter. We had a pa&s;&s;age of about eight weeks from land to land. Wc were about eighty or ninety pa&s;&s;engers, generally healthy, a|mong&s;t whom three children were born whil&s;t on board, and none removed by death. My uncle, John Morgan, who lived about 12 miles from the city of Phi|ladelphia, hearing of our arrival, came on board, and conducted us to his own hou&s;e, where I continued for &s;ome time, my bro|ther, being a weaver, &s;ettled at my aunt Mary <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, following his trade.</P>
<P>Removing from under my parents watch|ful care over me, for my good, furni&s;hed me with great opportunity to gratify a vain
<PB N="7" REF="016793_0012_0F9E3185C824A7E0">
mind, in the fooli&s;h amu&s;ements of a tran|&s;itory world, towards which I had but too great an inclination. But I have this to &s;ay, in order that parents may be encoura|ged to exert their godly endeavours for the pre&s;ervation of their children, that I do &s;tedfa&s;tly believe, the religious care of my parents over me in my youth, impre&s;&s;ed &s;o great an awe upon my mind, that, through the ble&s;&s;ing of Divine Providence, it was a great means of my pre&s;ervation from gro&s;s enormities; though I had great op|portunity of being plunged thereinto, after I left them. I hope ever to retain a grate|ful and thankful remembrance of tho&s;e gracious pre&s;ervations, when I con&s;ider, how narrowly I have e&s;caped tho&s;e rocks, upon which many have been &s;hipwrecked and ruined.</P>
<P>I was &s;ometimes vi&s;ited, and in degree awakened to a &s;en&s;e of my undone con|dition without a Saviour, after my arrival in American, though not &s;o frequently as when I was younger. As I had often, oh very often! knowingly with&s;tood it, my ta&s;te for worldly plea&s;ures being now grown &s;tronger, I was very unwilling to give up to the call of Chri&s;t. I could plead abund|ance of excu&s;es, concluding among other things, that I was but young, and might live a great many years; that if I did take my &s;wing a few years, I might become re|ligious &s;ooner than many others had done,
<PB N="8" REF="016793_0013_0F9E31868E042280">
who were brave men in their day. I would, however, to make my&s;elf the more ea&s;y for that time, fully determine to be a very re|ligious good man, at one time or other; but it mu&s;t not be yet. Thus, through the gro&s;s darkne&s;s which had covered my mind, I who had no certainty of &s;eeing the light of one day more, was prevailed upon, by the &s;ubtilty of Satan, to run the dread|ful hazard of a future repentance and amendment of life, and &s;o became wor&s;e and more hardened in evil, though &s;hall pre&s;erved out of gro&s;s pollutions, or what are commonly &s;o e&s;teemed; I was afraid to tell a lie, except to embelli&s;h, or &s;et off a plea&s;ant or merry tale or &s;tory; appre|hending it no great crime to tell a lie in je&s;t. I never remember to have &s;worn an oath, or uttered a cur&s;e in my life. Nor was I ever prevailed upon, in my cu&s;to|mary conver&s;ation, to depart from the rules of my education, re&s;pecting the plain lan|guage, thee and thou to one, and you to more than one; all this time pre&s;erving a pretty fair character among&s;t men, as none could charge me with any thing accounted &s;candalous. I retained much love and re|gard for tho&s;e I thought truly religious; e&s;pecially weighty &s;ub&s;tantial mini&s;ters of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel; and I believe had a better &s;en&s;e of their &s;pirits and labours, than &s;ome of my companions had, and therefore was afraid to de&s;pi&s;e or &s;peak contempti|bly
<PB N="9" REF="016793_0014_0F9E318783CC32D0">
of &s;uch, as &s;ome of my a&s;&s;ociates did. In this carnal degenerate &s;tate, I did com|monly, in a cu&s;tomary way, attend fir&s;t-day meetings, and mo&s;tly had the liberty of going on other days of the week, when any mini&s;ters from di&s;tant parts came to vi&s;it Abington meeting, to which I belong|ed: but alas! it was to little or no good purpo&s;e, as the labour be&s;towed upon me, by mini&s;try or otherwi&s;e, was like water &s;pilt upon a &s;tone, that &s;oon runs off again with|out any entrance; I being indeed for &s;ome time, like the heath in the de&s;art, not knowing when good came: and if at any time, the &s;eed of God's kingdom fell upon my heart, which was like the high-way ground, it was &s;oon taken away, and I pre&s;ently lo&s;t the &s;avour thereof.</P>
<P>When I had arrived to upwards of nine|teen years of age, I was, through infinite mercy never to be forgotten, vi&s;ited in an ex|traordinary manner; concerning which, as it was the happy means of turning my mind, in a good degree, from the peri&s;hing vanities of an uncertain world, to the God of all &s;ure mercies, I intend to be &s;ome|what particular. One evening, being with divers of my companions in vanity, and under no re&s;traint, as the heads of the fa|mily were not at home, we carried our frothy vain conver&s;ation, and fooli&s;h rude actions, to a higher degree of wicked mad|ne&s;s, than I ever was guilty of before, in
<PB N="10" REF="016793_0015_0F9E318806D54868">
which I &s;uppo&s;e I was as a ringleader. On this account, I felt &s;ome &s;harp la&s;hes of con&s;cience as I went to bed that night; and a thoughtfulne&s;s took hold of my mind, that we had not a being in this world for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, or to &s;pend our time as above mentioned, of which I gave &s;ome hint to my bed-fellow; yet this conviction did not &s;ink &s;o deep, but that I pretty &s;oon got to &s;leep. I had not &s;lept long, before a me&s;&s;enger alarmed me with an account, that one of my jolly companions, who was then in the hou&s;e, and who, I think, had been the be&s;t of us, was dying, de&s;iring me to go immediately to him, which I did. I was exceedingly &s;truck with horror of mind, at the thoughts of the manner in which we had &s;pent the evening before, and the &s;udden &s;troke that followed upon this poor man. But when I came to his bed&s;ide, and &s;aw the dreadful agony he was in, my horror was increa&s;ed beyond all expre&s;&s;ion; as none of us expected he could live many hours. For my part, I was &s;o deeply plunged into anxiety of mind, that it &s;eemed as if the pains and terrors of hell had laid hold of me already; and I was then in full expectation there was no deliverance for me therefrom; but that I &s;hould die, with the weight of that di&s;tre&s;s which was upon me, before morning. This happened on a &s;eventh-day night, and though the young man in time recovered, yet he was
<PB N="11" REF="016793_0016_0F9E318A7351E0E0">
not fit to be left next day, which hindered me from going to meeting, to which I was exceedingly de&s;irous to have gone; for by this time I was pretty thoroughly awa|kened to a &s;en&s;e of duty; and it being a week before the like opportunity pre&s;ented to me again, it &s;eemed the longe&s;t week I had ever known. Oh, how did I long to pre&s;ent my&s;elf before the Lord in the a&s;&s;emblies of his people! that I might pour forth my in|ward cries before him, in a &s;tate of &s;incere repentance, and deep contrition of &s;oul; which, through the effectual operation of his power in my heart, I was then in a condition to do. Now I clearly &s;aw, that repentance is the gift of God, and that his love, wherewith he hath loved us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord, leads &s;inners thereinto. The fle&s;hly will being, for the pre&s;ent, overcome and &s;ilenced, there was a giving up, with all readine&s;s of mind, to the Lord's requirings. There was not any thing then too near to part with for the real and &s;ub&s;tantial enjoyment of the beloved of my &s;oul; for I was brought in degree to expe|rience, that he came
<Q>for judgment into this world, that they which &s;ee not might &s;ee; and that they which &s;ee might be made blind.</Q>
I could no longer look upon my former delights with any &s;atisfaction, but in&s;tead thereof, had a glorious view of the beauti|ful &s;ituation of mount Sion, and my face was turned thitherward, and for the joy which
<PB N="12" REF="016793_0017_0F9E318B9A969848">
was &s;et before me, I was made willing to en|dure
<Q>the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;hame;</Q>
and though I became a wonder and a gazing &s;tock to my former companions, I did not much regard it, knowing I had ju&s;t cau&s;e &s;o to be. My great change &s;truck them with &s;ome awe, for I ob&s;erved they had not the boldne&s;s to mock or deride me before my face.</P>
<P>The young man, who was an in&s;trument in the divine hand for my awakening, and his brother, were both greatly reached and deeply affected, for the pre&s;ent, by the above-mentioned wonderful vi&s;itation, and there was a very vi&s;ible change in them for a time; but, like the &s;eed that fell on the &s;tony ground, they withered away, and did not become fruitful to God.</P>
<P>I greatly rejoiced when fir&s;t day came, that I might go to meeting; which proved to me indeed a memorable one, there being two public friends, &s;trangers, &s;ent thither, as I thought, on my account; for mo&s;t of what they had to deliver, appeared to me applicable to my &s;tate. Now did I, in &s;ome degree, experience the &s;ub&s;tance of what was intended, by the
<Q>bapti&s;m of water unto repentance; the wa&s;hing of water by the word; and being born of water and the &s;pirit.</Q>
All which would be fully &s;een, and clearly under&s;tood, by the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;|tianity, were they rightly acquainted with the
<Q>go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; which is the power of God
<PB N="13" REF="016793_0018_0F9E318BCFED58C8">
unto &s;alvation.</Q>
This power, inwardly re|vealed, is alone able to work that change in them, without which, our Lord &s;aith none &s;hall &s;o much as &s;ee the kingdom of God. But alas! being carnal in their minds, a &s;piri|tual religion doth not &s;uit them; for, as &s;aith the &s;cripture,
<Q>the natural man receiveth not the things of the &s;pirit of God, for they are fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him; neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cern|ed.</Q>
Hence it is, that the profe&s;&s;ors of the Chri&s;tian name, retain &s;igns and &s;hadows, whil&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance is neglected; pleading for the continuance of types, when the antitype is but little regarded: where this latter is ex|perienced, all &s;hadows and types vani&s;h and come to an end; as did the legal types, when Chri&s;t, the antitype, came, and intro|duced his di&s;pen&s;ation, which is altogether of a &s;piritual nature. And, what is yet more wonderful, and an evidence of great ignorance, is, to find tho&s;e happy and ble&s;&s;ed effects, which are only produced by the bap|ti&s;m of Chri&s;t with the Holy Gho&s;t, attribut|ed or annexed to the ceremonies of &s;prinkling a little water by a prie&s;t in a child's face: for, when that is done, the prie&s;t prays, 'that old Adam in the child may be bu|ried; that the new man may be rai&s;ed up in him; that all carnal affection may die in him; and that all things belonging to the &s;pirit may live and grow in him.' Then he prays, that the element of water may be
<PB N="14" REF="016793_0019_0F9E318CB13C4B38">
&s;anctified to the wa&s;hing away &s;in. The child is then &s;aid to be received into the congregation of Chri&s;t's flock, and &s;igned with the &s;ign of the cro&s;s: when this is done, they acknowledge the child to be regenerate, and grafted into the body of Chri&s;t's church, and return thanks to God, in that he hath been plea&s;ed to regenerate that infant with his Holy Spirit, and to receive him for his own by adoption: Concerning a child &s;prinkled, they &s;ay, 'who being born in original &s;in, and the wrath of God, is now, by the laver of re|generation in bapti&s;m, received into the number of the children of God, and heirs of everla&s;ting life.' They &s;ay, by bapti&s;m, viz. &s;prinkling infants, that they have put on Chri&s;t, and that they are made chil|dren of God and of the light. They hold children baptized, dying before they com|mit actual &s;in, are undoubtedly &s;aved; which &s;eemeth to imply, others are not. Being now weary of reciting the&s;e palpable errors, I &s;hall proceed with the account of my own progre&s;s, in the real experience of this great work of regeneration, or the new birth, which, I well know, is not ob|tained at &s;o ea&s;y a rate as above-mentioned.</P>
<P>This admini&s;tration of water by the word continued in a remarkable manner upon me, for about three months, in which I found great &s;atisfaction, as it was accompained with an heavenly &s;weetne&s;s, like healing

bal&s;am upon my wounded &s;pirit; my heart being melted before the Lord, as wax is melted before the fire. Great was my de|light in reading the holy &s;criptures, and other good books; being favoured, at that time, to receive much comfort and im|provement thereby. But this ea&s;y melting di&s;pen&s;ation, was to give way to a more powerful one, that the floor might be tho|roughly purged, even the bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t and fire: for the former di&s;|pen&s;ation of the Lord to my &s;oul &s;eemed much to re&s;emble John's bapti&s;m with water unto repentance, as being the real thing &s;ignified thereby, in order to prepare the way of the Lord.</P>
<P>Under this di&s;pen&s;ation I was for a time exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, in a &s;en&s;e of the great alteration I found in the &s;tate of my mind; attributing it to &s;ome cau&s;e given by me, that I was thus, as I thought, for&s;aken. All the former tenderne&s;s was gone, and I was as the parched ground. My agonies were &s;o great, that when it was day I wi&s;hed for night; and when it was night I wi&s;hed for day. In meetings for wor&s;hip, where I had enjoyed mo&s;t &s;atisfaction, I now was under the greate&s;t weight of pain and di&s;tre&s;s, even to that degree, at times, that I could &s;carcely forbear crying aloud for mere agony. When meeting was over, I would &s;ometimes walk a con&s;iderable way into the woods, that unheard by any mor|tal,
<PB N="16" REF="016793_0021_0F9E318E0982BCF8">
I might, in mournful accents, give vent to my greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;oul. In this doleful &s;tate of mind, the grand adver&s;ary was permitted to pour forth floods of temp|tations. I was almo&s;t con&s;tantly be&s;et with evil thoughts, which exceedingly grieved me; for though I was in &s;uch a dark di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed condition, my mind was, by this time, too much enlightened to allow of, or join with, wicked and corrupt thoughts: yet I often judged my&s;elf, and I believe at times not without cau&s;e, being apprehen|&s;ive, I was not earne&s;t enough in re&s;i&s;ting tho&s;e evil thoughts and temptations. But, oh! I was exceeding weak in tho&s;e days; and I am per&s;uaded the Lord, in gracious conde&s;cen&s;ion, looked mercifully at the &s;in|cerity of my intention, not marking all my failings, or I could not have &s;tood before him in any degree of acceptance. Very great were my temptations, and deep my di&s;tre&s;s of mind for about a year; in which time I was but as a little child in under|&s;tanding the way and work of God upon me, for my redemption. Yet, he who will not break the brui&s;ed reed, nor quench the &s;moaking flax, until he &s;ends forth judgment unto victory, by his invi&s;ible power, bore up my head above the rage|ing waves of temptation, &s;o that the enemy found he could not overwhelm me there|with: the Lord teaching my hands to war, and my fingers to fight under his banner,
<PB N="17" REF="016793_0022_0F9E318F1400D980">
through who&s;e ble&s;&s;ing and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I found &s;ome degree of victory over the bea&s;t, viz. that part which hath its life in fle&s;hly gratifications. Then began the fal&s;e pro|phet to work with &s;igns and lying won|ders, in order to deceive my weak and un|&s;kilful under&s;tanding; as it is written, 'Satan is transformed into an angel of light:' &s;o I found him, at lea&s;t in appearance. He that goes about &s;eeking whom he may de|vour, perceiving I was too much enlighten|ed from above, to be ea&s;ily drawn into &s;en|&s;uality, craftily attempted my de&s;truction another way, viz. by &s;etting him&s;elf up, undi&s;covered then by me, for a guide in the way of mortification, which I was then re|&s;olved, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to walk carefully in, by denying my&s;elf in all things which appeared incon&s;i&s;tent with the di|vine will. This &s;ubtil transformer, tak|ing advantage of the ardency of my mind to pre&s;s forward in this nece&s;&s;ary concern, &s;ugge&s;ted that my work would be much ea&s;ier in obtaining a complete victory over evil, were I to refrain for a time from &s;ome of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, particularly from eating, and taking my natural re&s;t in &s;leep, except ju&s;t as much as would pre&s;erve life; and that I mu&s;t con&s;tantly keep my hands employed in bu&s;ine&s;s, as idlene&s;s is the nur&s;ery of vice; neither was he want|ing to bring &s;cripture, and pa&s;&s;ages out of other religious books, to confirm the&s;e re|quirings.
<PB N="18" REF="016793_0023_0F9E3191846F6428">
I then really believed it was the voice of Chri&s;t in my mind commanding the&s;e things, and therefore endeavoured to be faithful therein, till my natural &s;trength abated, and I found my body grew much weaker thereby. Greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed I was, when at any time I fell &s;hort of what I apprehended to be my duty in the&s;e re&s;pects, he that required this &s;ervice being a hard ma&s;ter; though he had power to deceive, yet he could not give me faith that I &s;hould overcome. My views in tho&s;e days were indeed very di&s;couraging, my poor afflicted &s;oul being almo&s;t &s;unk into de&s;pair. My friends took notice that I was in uncommon di&s;tre&s;s. The family in which I then lived, as they could not be altogether ig|norant, though I concealed it as much as I could, of my wandering about in the fields, &amp;c. at nights, and much refraining from food (my deep di&s;tre&s;s being al&s;o very legibly imprinted on my countenance) feared, as I afterwards under&s;tood, le&s;t I &s;hould be tempted to lay violent hands on my&s;elf. I was forbid in my&s;elf to tell my condition to any, as that would be &s;eek|ing relief from without; a very improper and unworthy thing.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding which, the God of all grace, who permitted this uncommon af|fliction to fall upon me for a trial, and not for my de&s;truction, was plea&s;ed, in wonder|ful kindne&s;s, to move upon the heart of a
<PB N="19" REF="016793_0024_0F9E3192A2441070">
mini&s;ter belonging to our meeting, to vi&s;it me, and to open a way for my deliverance. He &s;trictly inquired concerning my inward condition, informing me that friends were much concerned about me, as it was very obvious I was under &s;ome uncommon tempt|ation. I was at fir&s;t very unwilling to open my &s;tate to him, however he at length pre|vailed, and took the opportunity to &s;hew me that I was under a gro&s;s delu&s;ion of Satan. Being thus, through the Lord's mercy, delivered from the wicked de&s;ign of mine enemy, which undoubtedly was to de&s;troy both &s;oul and body, I had, in reverent thankfulne&s;s, to rejoice in his &s;alvation. I then clearly &s;aw, that Satan in his religious appearance, was al&s;o carefully to be guarded again&s;t; as nothing in religion can be accept|able to God, but the genuine product of his unerring &s;pirit, di&s;tinctly heard and under&s;tood by the ear of the &s;oul, and the renewed under&s;tanding. "My &s;heep," &s;aid Chri&s;t, "hear my voice;" which I now began to experience fulfilled; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for ever! I had many precious openings into the divine my&s;teries about this time; and when I read the holy &s;criptures, they were opened to my under&s;tanding, far beyond whatever they had been before, &s;o that I had very great comfort; my hope being re|vived, and my faith much &s;trengthened, by tho&s;e things that were written aforetime. I am well a&s;&s;ured, by certain experience,
<PB N="20" REF="016793_0025_0F9E319349F681B0">
that the my&s;teries couched in tho&s;e holy writings, cannot be profitably under&s;tood, but by the &s;ame &s;pirit which in&s;pired the penmen of them; therefore it is vain pre|&s;umption, for fallen and unregenerate man, by his earthly wi&s;dom and human learning, to attempt the unfolding heavenly my&s;teries. The lip of truth hath &s;ignified, they are hid from the wi&s;e and prudent of this world, and revealed unto the humble dependent babes and &s;ucklings; tho&s;e who &s;en&s;ibly experience their &s;ufficiency for every good word and work, to proceed immediately from God alone; and that Chri&s;t
<Q>is made unto them, wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemption.</Q>
The want of this inward living &s;en&s;e, hath been the cau&s;e of, and hath opened the way for, that great apo&s;ta&s;y, dark|ne&s;s, and error, which have over&s;pread Chri&s;|tendom, &s;o called. There is no way for its recovery, but by humbly &s;ubmitting to Chri&s;t inwardly revealed, and learning the nature of true religion of him, the great author thereof: for I am well a&s;&s;ured, that forward active and inventing &s;elf mu&s;t be denied, aba&s;ed, and laid in the du&s;t for ever, and the Lord alone exalted in our hearts, before we can come up in the &s;eve|ral duties of religion, with divine appro|bation. This I &s;aw, in the divine light which began to &s;hine out of my darkne&s;s, and &s;eparated me therefrom, was the great|er light which was to rule the day of
<PB N="21" REF="016793_0026_0F9E31940D8C9CD8">
God's &s;alvation, and that all the &s;aved of the Lord mu&s;t carefully walk in this light, wherein there is no occa&s;ion of &s;tumbling. I al&s;o &s;aw, that when it plea&s;ed the Lord in wi&s;dom, for a trial of my faith and pa|tience, to withdraw this holy light, and there was a &s;itting in darkne&s;s, and as in the region of the &s;hadow of death for a time, &s;o that I had no di&s;tinct knowledge therefrom what to do; that it was my indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to &s;tand &s;till, and wait for my &s;ure unerring guide; if at tho&s;e times, &s;elf would ari&s;e and be unea&s;y, it mu&s;t be brought to the cro&s;s, there to be &s;lain. By &s;uch experience, I found I was nothing, and that God was all things nece&s;&s;ary for &s;oul and body; that if I was brought into a &s;tate of perfect reconciliation with him, I mu&s;t know all things made new.</P>
<P>About this time I had a di&s;tant view of being called into the work of the mini&s;try; my mind being at times wonderfully over|&s;hadowed with the univer&s;al love of God, in the glorious go&s;pel of his Son, to mankind, to that degree that I thought I could, in the &s;trength thereof, give up to &s;pend and to be &s;pent, for the gathering of &s;ouls to him, the great Shepherd of I&s;rael; and that I could lift up my voice like a trumpet, to awaken the inhabitants of the earth: but I found all this was only by way of prepa|ration for this important work, and that I had not yet received a commi&s;&s;ion to engage
<PB N="22" REF="016793_0027_0F9E3195101FEA18">
therein. A fear was upon my mind, and care, le&s;t I &s;hould pre&s;ume to enter upon this &s;olemn undertaking without a right call; it appearing to me exceeding danger|ous to &s;peak in the name of the Lord, without a clear evidence in the mind, that he required it of me; which I then fully believed he would in his own time, which was to be waited for. From this time, until I was really called into the work, I frequently had, but e&s;pecially in religious meetings, openings of &s;cripture-pa&s;&s;ages, with lively operations of the divine power in my mind; and &s;ometimes with &s;o much energy, that I have been almo&s;t ready to offer what I had upon my mind, to others. But as, through an holy awe which dwelt upon my heart, I endeavoured to try my offering in the unerring balance of the &s;anctuary, I found it was too light to be offered, and was thankful to the Lord for his merciful pre&s;ervation, in that I had been enabled to avoid offering the &s;acrifice of fools. But when the time really came that it was divinely required of me, the evidence was &s;o indi&s;putably clear, that there was not the lea&s;t room to doubt; yet, through fear and human frailty, I put it off, and did not give way thereunto. But oh! how was I condemned in my&s;elf! The divine &s;weet|ne&s;s which had covered my mind in the meeting was withdrawn, and I left in a very poor di&s;con&s;olate &s;tate, wherein I was
<PB N="23" REF="016793_0028_0F9E3195D1964608">
ready to beg forgivene&s;s, and to covenant with the Lord, that if he would be plea&s;ed to favour me again in like manner, I would give up to his requiring. At the next fir&s;t-day meeting, the heavenly power over|&s;hadowed me in a wonderful manner, in which it was required of me to kneel down in &s;upplication to the Lord in a few words: I gave way thereunto, in the dread of his power, with fear and trembling. After which, oh, how my &s;oul was filled with peace and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t! I could then &s;ing, and make &s;weet melody in my heart to the Lord. As I remember, I was twenty-one years of age, the very day I fir&s;t entered into this great and awful work of the mini&s;try; which was the 21&s;t of the 5th month, old &s;tile, 1734.</P>
<P>I have found my mind engaged to be &s;ome|what particular concerning the manner of my entering into the work of the mini&s;try, to &s;tand by way of caution and proper en|couragement to others, who may peru&s;e the &s;ame; having in the cour&s;e of my ob&s;ervation had cau&s;e to fear, &s;ome have taken the work of preparation, as before hinted, for the thing it&s;elf; and &s;o have proceeded very far, to their own great wounding, and the hurt of others, in bring|ing forth untimely fruit, which is exceed|ingly dangerous, and carefully to be avoid|ed. Nothing is a &s;ufficient guard to pre|&s;erve therefrom, but the &s;ingle eye, through
<PB N="24" REF="016793_0029_0F9E31964FB04FC8">
the divine ble&s;&s;ing, awfully con&s;idering what a great thing it is for du&s;t and a&s;hes to &s;peak as the apo&s;tle Peter directs, viz.
<Q>As every man hath received the gift, even &s;o mini&s;ter the &s;ame one to another, as good &s;tewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man &s;peak, let him &s;peak as the oracles of God; if any man mi|ni&s;ter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth.</Q>
The author to the Hebrews &s;aith, that
<Q>no man taketh this honour to him&s;elf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</Q>
So that what|ever &s;ome may pretend to, and intrude them&s;elves into, unle&s;s they are really cal|led of God, they will have no &s;hare in that honour that cometh from God only.</P>
<P>The church of Chri&s;t hath not been with|out its trouble from fal&s;e mini&s;ters, neither in the primitive times, nor in ours. That excellent go&s;pel liberty of all who feel them&s;elves in&s;pired thereunto, whether male or female, &s;peaking or prophe&s;ying one by one, hath been, and &s;till is, abu&s;ed by fal&s;e pretenders to divine in&s;piration; yet the liberty ought to be pre&s;erved inviolable, and other means found out to remedy this great inconveniency; which would not be difficult, were the members in a general way &s;piritually minded, rightly favouring the things that be of God. Forward and un|&s;anctified appearances, by way of mini&s;try, would then be ea&s;ily awed and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="25" REF="016793_0030_0F9E3198D1DCE040">
&s;o as not to di&s;turb the peace of the church. The ca&s;e has been otherwi&s;e, as I have ob&s;erved in &s;ome places; but little minded, if the words and doctrine were &s;ound, and no|thing to blame in the conver&s;ation. Here the main thing, which is the powerful demon&s;tration of the holy &s;pirit, is little regarded: and if a few are deeply pained at heart with &s;uch lifele&s;s mini&s;try, they find it exceeding difficult to lay hands there|on, for want of more &s;trength; e&s;pecially when they perceive what &s;trength there is again&s;t them: for formal profe&s;&s;ors love to have it &s;o, rather than to &s;it in &s;ilence. And I have ob&s;erved &s;uch pretenders all mouth or tongue, and no ears to receive in&s;truction; fond of teaching others, but very unteachable them&s;elves. I pray God to quicken his people, and rai&s;e the &s;ociety into a more lively &s;en&s;e of that ble&s;&s;ed arm of power which gathered us to be a people; or, I fear, the great evil above hinted at will prove a very growing one: profe&s;&s;ion without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, being the proper element for &s;uch a mini&s;try to grow and flori&s;h in. I am not quite free to omit a remark on this head, as I am fully per&s;uaded the living members of the church of Chri&s;t, groan under a painful &s;en&s;e of this &s;orrowful token of a declined &s;ociety. May the Lord of &s;abbath hear their cries, and regard the angui&s;h of their &s;ouls in &s;ecret, &s;o as to work by his invi&s;ible power

<P>I have given &s;ome hints how it was with me, by way of preparative for the great and important work of the mini&s;try, and the danger of my being mi&s;led; even at &s;ome|times when I had right openings, and felt the &s;weet efficacious virtue of the love of God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to mankind: which, doubtle&s;s, is the &s;en&s;ible experience and enjoyment, at times, of every faithful follower of Chri&s;t, who never was called to the work of the mini&s;try. I was in tho&s;e days apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome danger of being led out at that door; but I have &s;ince more fully and perfectly &s;een the danger of this and other by-paths, which would have led me to give that away to others, which I was to live upon my&s;elf; and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ut of the humble dependant &s;tate, in which only there is &s;afety, to have a will and way of my own, that I might be furni&s;hed and enriched with much trea&s;ure.

<PB N="27" REF="016793_0032_0F9E319A0AE6A640">
Divine Providence over me, brought the day of the Lord upon it all: &s;o that I came clearly to &s;ee, and experimentally to know, my &s;ufficiency was of God; that there mu&s;t be a &s;teady dependance on the Lord, to be immediately fitted and &s;upplied, every time I was to engage in this &s;olemn &s;ervice. I ardently de&s;ire, that all who have the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of being called into the work of the mini&s;try, may dwell in an holy dread of the divine pre&s;ence, and know their own wills wholly &s;ubjected to the divine will; waiting for a di&s;tinct and clear certainty of the Lord's requirings, not only in entering upon it at fir&s;t, but al&s;o at all other times. And as &s;elf comes to be laid in the du&s;t for ever, they will receive undeniable evi|dence, in their own minds, of the certainty of their mi&s;&s;ion; and they will not be with|out a te&s;timony thereof, from the witne&s;s for God in the con&s;ciences of mankind, among&s;t whom they are &s;ent to mini&s;ter.

<P>Having thus entered upon the &s;olemn and awful &s;ervice of the mini&s;try, I gave up for the mo&s;t part, as I found the requirings of truth, through the divine power and effi|cacy thereof, moving upon my heart, and &s;ubjecting my will, to utter a few words in a broken manner, with fear and trem|bling; the Lord being exceeding merciful to me, as a tender father, taking me by the hand, and making me willing by his mighty power, to be counted a fool for his &s;ake and the go&s;pel's.</P>
<P>The meeting I then belonged to was large, and a valuable weighty body of friends therein; who, as far as I could ob&s;erve by their carriage, did own and approve of my weak and low appearance in this &s;ervice: yet they u&s;ed Chri&s;tian prudence, not to lay hands &s;uddenly, but gave me full oppor|tunity to make proof of my mini&s;try, and to feel my feet therein.</P>
<P>About this time, a fine &s;pring of mini&s;|try was opened within the compa&s;s of our Yearly-Meeting; there having, by account, about one hundred opened their mouths in publick te&s;timony, in little more than a year; divers of whom became powerful able

mini&s;ters, and &s;ome of them withered away like unripe fruit. About ten appeared with|in that time, in the particular meeting of Abington, to which I belonged.</P>
<P>As I was enabled to wait on my mini&s;try, I experienced a con&s;iderable growth and en|largement; and, in a faithful di&s;charge of duty therein, great peace and heavenly con|&s;olation, like a plea&s;ant refre&s;hing &s;tream, flowed into my &s;oul. I al&s;o found, that it was a means of engaging the minds of friends, in a &s;weet and comfortable near|ne&s;s of unity with me, which I had never before &s;o largely and livingly felt. Many young well-minded people, and &s;ome others of little experience, &s;eemed to admire my gift, and would &s;ometimes &s;peak highly of it, which they did not always forbear in my hearing. But oh how dangerous this is, if delighted in by mini&s;ters! It may be ju&s;tly compared to poi&s;on, which will &s;oon de&s;troy the pure innocent life. My judg|ment was again&s;t it; yet I found &s;omething in me, that &s;eemed to have no aver&s;ion thereunto, but rather inclined to hearken to it, yet not with full approbation. The &s;ame thing in me would want to know, what &s;uch and &s;uch, who were in mo&s;t e&s;teem for experience and wi&s;dom, thought of me. I &s;ometimes imagined &s;uch looked &s;hy upon me, which would much ca&s;t me down; all which, being from a root or fibre of &s;elf, I found was for judgment,
<PB N="30" REF="016793_0035_0F9E319CAD31A808">
and mu&s;t die upon the cro&s;s, before I was fit to be tru&s;ted with any great &s;tore of go&s;pel trea&s;ure. I begun al&s;o to take ra|ther too much delight my&s;elf in the gift; which had not divine goodne&s;s in mercy, by a deep and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing bapti&s;m, kindly pre|vented; might have opened a door for &s;piri|tual pride (which is the wor&s;t of pride) to have entered in, to my ruin. I have rea&s;on to think, that &s;olid friends, by ob&s;erving my large growth in the top, with &s;preading branches, were in fear of my downfall, in ca&s;e of a &s;torm. However, in the mid&s;t of my high career, the Lord was plea&s;ed to take away from me, for a time, that which he had given me, viz. the gift of the mini|&s;try, and with it all &s;en&s;ible comforts of the &s;pirit: &s;o that I was, as I thought, in total darkne&s;s; even in the region and &s;ha|dow of death. In this doleful &s;tate of mind, I was grievou&s;ly be&s;et and tempted by the fal&s;e prophet, the transformer, to keep up my credit in the mini&s;try, by continuing my publick appearances. It might well be &s;aid of him, that he would <Q>cau&s;e fire to come down from heaven, in the &s;ight of men, to deceive them;</Q>
for &s;o I found it. It is hard to imagine, how near a re&s;em|blance he could make, how exact an imi|tation he could form of the very thing it|&s;elf, to the &s;tate of mind I was then in; even to that degree, that I have at times been ready to &s;ay, 'Ah! I &s;ee and feel the
<PB N="31" REF="016793_0036_0F9E319D0A4F7338">
fire of the Lord coming down to prepare the offering'; and have been almo&s;t ready to give up thereunto, when a godly fear would &s;eize my mind, and a de&s;ire yet to try it; by which means, the &s;trong delu&s;ion hath been di&s;covered, and the fal&s;e fire rejected. My &s;oul hath been plunged into deeper anxiety, by this fal&s;e heat, than I was in before. No tongue nor pen can &s;et forth to the full, the deep and almo&s;t con&s;tant angui&s;h of my &s;oul, for about the &s;pace of four or five months; being as near as I can remember the time this &s;ore affliction was upon me. It fared with me in &s;ome degree, as it did with Job, re&s;pecting my friends; &s;ome conjecturing one thing, and &s;ome another thing, to be the cau&s;e of this fall, as it was apprehended; though, through mercy, they could not charge me with any evil as the cau&s;e thereof. The mo&s;t probable rea&s;on to them, of this alte|ration was, that I had been too much &s;et up by others, and &s;o had lo&s;t my gift; and this, I think, came the neare&s;t to the truth of the ca&s;e. Yet it was not &s;o lo&s;t, but that when my gracious helper &s;aw my &s;uffer|ing was enough, he re&s;tored it again, and appeared to my &s;oul as a clear morning with|out clouds: everla&s;ting prai&s;es to his holy name! My mind was deeply bowed in hum|ble thankfulne&s;s, under a &s;en&s;e of the great favour of being again counted worthy to be intru&s;ted with &s;o precious a gift; therefore I
<PB N="32" REF="016793_0037_0F9E319E1B36B0A8">
was careful to exerci&s;e the &s;ame in great fear and awfulne&s;s, and more in a cro&s;s to mine own will than before; as that which was but too likely to have decked it&s;elf therewith, was, for the pre&s;ent at lea&s;t, in a good degree &s;lain. I have very often, in the cour&s;e of my religious experience, had cau&s;e to adore and admire divine wi&s;dom, in his dealings with me for my pre&s;erva|tion in the way of peace; being well a&s;&s;ured, that he will &s;o work for mankind, if they are &s;ufficiently given up in heart and &s;oul to him, that it will not be po&s;&s;ible for them to mi&s;s of everla&s;ting happine&s;s; for none are able to pluck tho&s;e out of his almighty hand, who do not fir&s;t incline to leave him.</P>
<P>After I had appeared in publick &s;ome|what more than two years, I found &s;ome drawings of go&s;pel-love, as I apprehended, to vi&s;it the meetings of friends in &s;ome part of New-Jer&s;ey; and being but young in the mini&s;try, I was in great fear, at times, le&s;t I &s;hould be mi&s;taken, in that which I, at other times, thought to be the divine requirings: for I much dreaded that of run|ning when and where the Lord did not &s;end me, le&s;t I &s;hould bring di&s;honour to his ble&s;&s;ed name, and expo&s;e my&s;elf naked and void of proper qualifications for &s;o great an undertaking, to wi&s;e and di&s;cerning friends. Great indeed was my di&s;tre&s;s, night and day, crying to the Lord for
<PB N="33" REF="016793_0038_0F9E31A100D2DC78">
greater confirmation; which he graciou&s;ly heard, and was plea&s;ed, by a dream or night-vi&s;ion, to afford me &s;uch full &s;atisfaction in, that I do not remember I had any doubt afterwards concerning the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I entered upon the &s;aid journey the 7th of the 8th month 1736; having a companion much older than my&s;elf every way. We vi&s;ited the following meetings, viz. Piles|grove, Salem, Aloways-creek, and Cohan&s;ey, where my companion left me, and returned home, being under &s;ome di&s;couragement about the journey in his own mind. But as I found the Lord by his ble&s;&s;ed power near, opening my mouth, and enlarging my heart abundantly in his work, I was encouraged thereby to proceed, being join|ed in travel by an innocent friend belong|ing to Aloways-creek-meeting, who had a few words to drop in meetings. We went from Cohan&s;ey, through a great de&s;art or wilder|ne&s;s, for about forty miles, without inhabi|tants, to Cape May, where we had a meet|ing. From thence to Great and Little Egg-Harbour, and had meetings. From thence, through the wilderne&s;s, to the yearly-meet|ing at Shrew&s;bury, which was large, and much favoured with the divine pre&s;ence: divers mini&s;tering friends from Penn&s;ylvania were there, viz. Thomas Chalkley, Robert Jordan, John and Evan Evans, Margaret Pre&s;ton, and others.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="016793_0039_0F9E31A223FA7AD0">It neither &s;uited with my growth in the mini&s;try, nor my inclination, to take up much time in tho&s;e large meetings. I there|fore, for the mo&s;t part, gave way to &s;uch as were better qualified for the work, and in my e&s;teem worthy of double honour. I had a great regard in my mind for tho&s;e whom I thought as pillars in the hou&s;e of God, whether mini&s;ters or elders; and really think, if &s;uch had given it as their &s;en&s;e, that I was wrong in my offerings, at any time, I &s;hould have been more likely to have depended on their judgment than my own. I looked upon my&s;elf, for many years, as a child in experience every way; and therefore thought a &s;ubjection was due from me, to tho&s;e who were fathers and mothers in I&s;rael, and never, that I remem|ber, manife&s;ted any di&s;regard to them; which is now a &s;atisfaction to my mind. But, I confe&s;s, I have at times &s;ince had cau&s;e to marvel at the forwardne&s;s of &s;ome, who though but children, if rightly child|ren, have undertaken the work of men, hardly di&s;covering a willingne&s;s to give the preference to any; and when they have been admoni&s;hed by tho&s;e of much more experi|ence than them&s;elves, they have been apt to retort, or to plead a divine commi&s;&s;ion, and that it is right to obey God rather than man; as if they had the &s;ole right of &s;peak|ing and judging too. I had divers times &s;een the great danger of being deceived and mi&s;led by the transformer; and therefore was
<PB N="35" REF="016793_0040_0F9E31A2516F97B0">
afraid of being over confident of mine own &s;ight, and looked upon it the &s;afe&s;t way to &s;tand quite open for in&s;truction, come from what quarter it would; there being nothing more de&s;ired by me, than to be right.</P>
<P>This large meeting ended well, and &s;weetly. Prai&s;es to the Lord over all for ever! From thence I went to the following meetings, viz. Che&s;terfield, Trenton, Bordentown, Mansfield, Upper Springfield, Old Spring|field, Burlington, Bri&s;tol, the Falls, Ancocas, Mount-holly, Eve&s;ham, Che&s;ter, Haddonfield, and Woodbury Creek; from whence I re|turned home. The Lord made my journey pro&s;perous, and was to me, at times, as a fountain un&s;ealed, furni&s;hing daily for the work he had engaged me in; being, in wonderful conde&s;cen&s;ion to my weak e&s;tate, both wi&s;dom and utterance; as it is written,
<Q>Out of the mouths of babes and &s;ucklings thou ha&s;t ordained &s;trength.</Q>
Prai&s;es to his holy name for ever!</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Lord committed un|to me a di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, and was plea&s;ed to reward my &s;incere labours therein, with the &s;weet incomes of peace and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, and with the unity of the brethren, in a comfortable degree; yet great were my temptations, and various the com|bats I had, for divers years after; with my &s;oul's enemies. Oh! how hard I found it to keep from being defiled, more or le&s;s,
<PB N="36" REF="016793_0041_0F9E31A30B780900">
with the polluting floods, which were al|mo&s;t continually poured out of the great red dragon's mouth, in order to carry away my imagination into unlawful delights, from which I did not always wholly e&s;cape; being &s;ometimes prevailed upon to &s;et bounds to my&s;elf, that though I would not directly fall into the evil I was tempted to, yet I might take &s;ome di&s;tant delight and &s;atisfaction, in approaching as near thereunto as I thought was lawful. Thus, for want of a watchful care, not only to &s;hun that which I knew to be really evil, but al&s;o every appearance of evil, I &s;ometimes brought great angui&s;h and deep di&s;tre&s;s upon my own mind; and when I had gone but a little out of the right way, I found many, oh! many weary &s;teps and painful heart-achings, before I was re|ceived into the way and favour of the hea|venly Father again. I have often &s;ince been humbly thankful for his pre&s;ervation, even out of gro&s;s evils, con&s;idering my danger|ous tampering therewith at times in the imagination. How can weak mortals deter|mine what length they will go, when any way is given? Mo&s;t certain it is, they go out greatly to their hurt, who take any plea|&s;ure at all in the thoughts of forbidden things. I have found, by woful experience, that when the lea&s;t way is given to the enemy, he gains much advantage over us, and we are greatly enfeebled thereby; &s;o that, in&s;tead of growing as willows by the
<PB N="37" REF="016793_0042_0F9E31A3D333A258">
water-cour&s;es, there is danger of withering, and becoming of tho&s;e that draw back, in whom the Lord hath no plea&s;ure. I have found it the fir&s;t &s;ubtil working of Satan, to draw me off from a con&s;tant care of bringing all my thoughts, words, and actions to be tried by the light of Chri&s;t in mine own heart; and in&s;tead thereof, to examine them by my partial rea&s;oning part. Here, many things really evil in their nature, or tendency, or both, would carry the appear|ances of indifferency; the pleading would then be, there is no harm in this, that, or the other thing: yet there hath been a doubt perhaps in the mind to rea&s;on away, not duly con&s;idering, that he who doubt|eth, is condemned if he receive. So I have many times found it, when the judge of all hath been plea&s;ed to ari&s;e, and to find me out, with my fig-leaf covering on; having very imprudently, by giving way to wrong things, in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t the garment of innocence, and an holy confidence to|wards God, Oh! how very hot hath my neglect occa&s;ioned the furnace to be made, that &s;o the dro&s;s might be done away.</P>
<P>Thus it was with me, until the many cha&s;|tenings of the heavenly Father had brought me into more fear, care, and &s;ubjection. I could not be quite ea&s;y to omit giving the&s;e hints of my many weakne&s;&s;es and failings, that others may learn thereby to be aware. This I apprehend to be the chief

rea&s;on of our having the failings and mi&s;|carriages of God's people tran&s;mitted to us in the holy &s;criptures. Thou traveller Sion|ward, look forward to the joy &s;et before thee, not &s;uffering thine eyes to wander about thee, le&s;t they convey &s;uch delight to thy heart, as may infect thy &s;oul with pernicious di&s;tempers, by which thou maye&s;t be rendered unable to proceed on thy jour|ney towards the holy city; and through the defect occa&s;ioned thereby to thy &s;ight, thou maye&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, lo&s;e the glori|ous pro&s;pect of its beautiful &s;ituation, and the &s;plendor of its &s;tructures. Beware thou do not load thy&s;elf with the &s;eeming plea|&s;ant fruit of that country through which thou travelle&s;t: although they may appear to hang plentifully on each hand, they will neither be of any u&s;e to thee in that hea|venly country whither thou art going, nor for refre&s;hment on the way thither. If thou ha&s;t a mind to make thine own way pro|&s;perous, look &s;teadily forward, with a &s;ingle eye, to the recompence of reward.

This is abundantly better than that unea&s;y in and out way of travelling, &s;inning and repenting, repenting and &s;inning again; which lays a foundation for murmuring,

<P>The 8th month 1737, I &s;et out in order to vi&s;it &s;ome meetings in Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey; hav|ing Richard French, an ancient friend, to bear me company. We had meetings at Stonybrook, Bethlehem, Lebanon, and at a Bapti&s;t's hou&s;e near Black-River. None of our &s;ociety were thereabouts, but there were &s;ome ranters of Rogers's followers, who had taken upon them the name of Qua|kers, to the great &s;candal of friends in that remote place: they came to the meeting, being mo&s;tly women. Their impatient re&s;t|le&s;s &s;pirits would not &s;uffer them to let us hold our meeting quietly; yet they did not &s;eem inclinable to contend, but rather to flatter and applaud us. Some of them &s;tood up, after we had &s;everally delivered what we had upon our minds, to &s;ignify their unity with our doctrine, pretending it to be the &s;ame they held forth to the peo|ple,
<PB N="40" REF="016793_0045_0F9E31A640DEF620">
though not enough regarded by them. But we were not free to receive their te&s;ti|mony, any more than Paul and Silas could that maid's who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an evil &s;pirit; but rebuked them openly, and pub|lickly declared our di&s;unity with them, de|&s;iring the people not to look upon them as belonging to the &s;ociety of the people called Quakers, as we could a&s;&s;ure the meeting it was not &s;o; and that we had no more unity with tho&s;e pretenders, than they had. I thought the chief &s;ervice we had at that place, was to te&s;tify again&s;t tho&s;e wild fran|tick people, who we found had, by being accounted Quakers, cau&s;ed the way of truth to be evil &s;poken of. This unexpected op|po&s;ition rai&s;ed their flighty &s;pirits, &s;o that they became very trouble&s;ome, being full of words, and a&s;king frivolous que&s;tions. Whereupon that of Paul, to &s;ome &s;uch wo|men in the Corinthian church, came fre&s;h into my mind. I therefore called out aloud, "Let your women be &s;ilent in the church;" and opened to them, that it was &s;uch women as they were, that the apo&s;tle rebuked and commanded to be &s;ilent; who not experi|encing their &s;pirits to be truly &s;ubjected, that they might know how to &s;peak con|cerning the things of God with a right un|der&s;tanding, ought to learn in &s;ilence: not meaning to exclude tho&s;e of mine own &s;ex in the like ca&s;e; the &s;ame being as nece&s;&s;ary for them. We left them as full of them|&s;elves
<PB N="41" REF="016793_0046_0F9E31A8D5F5B440">
as we found them, and went from thence to Whippany, where, in a friend's hou&s;e, we had a precious meeting. The greate&s;t number being of other &s;ocieties, the te&s;timony of truth flowed forth freely; they appearing to be much tendered and affected therewith. After meeting, &s;ome of them took us by the hand, and in an affectionate manner expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction with our labours among&s;t them. From thence we went to Plainfield, and Woodbridge, where we had meetings. After which we returned home; having been favoured to accompli&s;h this little journey to my own &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Sometime before I entered upon the be|fore-mentioned journey, I found my mind pretty &s;trongly drawn, and much inclined, to enter into a marriage &s;tate with a young woman belonging to the &s;ame meeting, with|in the compa&s;s of which I had lately taken a farm, and to which I was then joined by certificate. Her name was Rebekah, the daughter of Jo&s;iah and Sarah Fearn, and grand-daughter of John Blun&s;ton: &s;he being a valuable branch of a good &s;tock. By the death of her brother, &s;he was then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that part of her &s;aid grandfather's e&s;tate, where he had lived, and entertained friends from almo&s;t the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of Penn&s;yl|vania, until his death; which afterwards was continued by his widow many years, but of late years had been laid a&s;ide.
<PB N="42" REF="016793_0047_0F9E31A9F8BB3180">
It was in Lower Derby, about &s;even miles from Philadelphia, near a large meet|ing; the meeting-hou&s;e being built on &s;ome of that tract of land. The rea&s;on of my being &s;o particular in this account, is to &s;hew the Lord's kindne&s;s, and gracious con|de&s;cen&s;ion to me, in &s;o fully an&s;wering what I had &s;o often de&s;ired, viz. that in ca&s;e I ever married and &s;ettled, I might be &s;o placed and circum&s;tanced, as to entertain the Lord's &s;ervants and me&s;&s;engers in an agreeable manner: on which account, as well as that he was plea&s;ed to give me an affectionate virtuous wife, I had, and have great cau&s;e of humble thankfulne&s;s. We took each other in marriage the 30th of the 10th month 1737, at a large and &s;olemn meeting, held in the meeting-hou&s;e before-mentioned, under the precious over&s;hadow|ing of the power of divine love; I think to a larger degree than I had often, if ever, known before: which was no &s;mall confir|mation of our being rightly joined together; it being that alone which can truly enable to make and keep covenant rightly with each other.</P>
<P>After marriage, I con&s;tantly attended our particular meeting, both on fir&s;t and other days of the week; al&s;o the quarterly and yearly-meetings as they fell in cour&s;e, and frequently vi&s;ited adjacent meetings. I vi|&s;ited friends in the county of Bucks twice, but have no account by me of the exact
<PB N="43" REF="016793_0048_0F9E31AA9480A840">
time. I &s;ignified to my wife, &s;ome time after we were married, that I did expect, in a few years, I &s;hould find a concern to leave her for a longer time than I yet had done, and gave her a hint what time I thought it would be; which fell out accordingly; having then a di&s;tant view of vi&s;iting New-England.</P>
<P>When the time for undertaking that jour|ney appeared clear to me, I gave up thereto, in humble re&s;ignation and faith in the &s;uf|ficiency of that divine power which I be|lieved required it of me; yet not without &s;ome intervals of di&s;couragement, and rea|&s;oning in my&s;elf what would become of my family and outward concerns: neither did I then know of any companion to join with me in this great undertaking, but at times believed I &s;hould be favoured with one, if I gave up thereunto. However, I laid my con|cern before the monthly-meeting to which I belonged, reque&s;ting their concurrence and certificate, if upon a weighty con&s;ideration thereof, they had unity with my concern. A certificate was prepared, whereby I was left to my liberty to proceed; but I had not yet heard of a companion, and greatly feared going without. Our quarterly-meet|ing falling quickly after, I went to it, where I &s;oon made inquiry of my much e&s;teemed friend John Churchman, whether he knew of any &s;uitable companion for me. He readily told me that his brother-in-law,
<PB N="44" REF="016793_0049_0F9E31AB4CAC33A0">
William Brown, had procured a certificate in order for the &s;ame journey, and did not then know of any companion, but believed one would be provided for him. This was very acceptable to me. When William Brown and I had an opportunity of con|ferring together, which was the &s;ame day, we found our concerns and views &s;o exact|ly agree, and our &s;pirits &s;o clo&s;ely united for the &s;ervice, that our hearts bowed in thankfulne&s;s to the Lord, for his care and providence over us; believing what we were about to engage in, was agreeable to his will, and in his coun&s;el. It being the meeting for mini&s;ters and elders that day, we laid our concern before that meeting, where it appeared to be well approved, which was no &s;mall &s;trength to us. I did then, and hope ever &s;hall, greatly love and highly value the unity of the brethren; having found it no &s;mall &s;trength and en|couragement to me, in many low and try|ing times, which are nece&s;&s;ary and unavoid|able in that &s;olemn engagement of vi&s;it|ing the churches; e&s;pecially now in their low declined &s;tate. It became indi&s;putably clear to my under&s;tanding, that it is alto|gether impo&s;&s;ible to admini&s;ter, in a feel|ing effectual manner, to people's &s;everal &s;tates, unle&s;s we are baptized thereinto. Well adapted words, and &s;ound doctrine, as to the external appearance, may, with|out much difficulty, be attained; &s;eeing we

have the holy &s;criptures, and many other good books, containing the principles of truth, and the Chri&s;tian experience of the Lord's people: yet all this, delivered with the tongue of men or angels, will prove an empty, fruitle&s;s &s;ound, without the power and demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, who enables his upright-hearted mini&s;ters to &s;earch all things, yea, the hidden my&s;|tery of iniquity, as well as the deep things of God, even as he led his prophet Ezekiel to look through the hole in the wall, that the mo&s;t &s;ecret abomination may be brought to light, and te&s;tified again&s;t.</P>
<P>I took leave of my dear wife, and &s;et out with my before-mentioned companion, the 5th of the 7th month, 1741. Pa&s;&s;ing through New Jer&s;ey, we had a meeting at Che&s;ter|field. We cro&s;&s;ed Staten-I&s;land, and came to an arm of the &s;ea, called the Narrows, which &s;eparates the before-mentioned i&s;land from Long-I&s;land. The wind blowing very &s;trong, and the &s;ea running exceeding high, we were obliged to wait &s;ome time; the ferry-men being afraid to run the hazard of carrying us (and divers others who were there al&s;o waiting) over. Towards evening the wind &s;omewhat abating, they appeared willing to venture, if we would; and we being de&s;irous to proceed, agreed to go. I think we had eight or nine hor&s;es, be&s;ides people, in the boat. They &s;et all their heads to the wind, which proved of &s;ingular &s;er|vice,

in bearing up the boat again&s;t it, otherwi&s;e it did not &s;eem altogether impro|bable, but that &s;he would have been laid on her &s;ide. We ran over in about ten minutes, which is accounted at lea&s;t two miles and an half. We were thankful for pre&s;ervation; as I believe mo&s;t, or all of us, when we were on the water, apprehended &s;ome con&s;iderable danger. We made but little &s;tay on Long-I&s;land, only taking New|town meeting in our way. Then cro&s;&s;ing the water, to the main land in New-York government, had meetings at Mamaroneck, Long-reach, and the Purcha&s;e. From thence, having a guide provided for us, we &s;et out for our journey, about 200 miles through the colony of Connecticut to Rhode-I&s;land. We met with a kind reception and entertain|ment for our money, at a very low rate, among&s;t the high profe&s;&s;ing Pre&s;byterians of this colony: the ca&s;e was very different formerly, when our friends were bani&s;hed from thence by a law. I remarked, as I pa&s;&s;ed along, very good order ob&s;erved in their inns; and, as far as could be di&s;covered, the people in general appeared to be &s;ober, and religious in their way; far from being &s;o vitiated and corrupt as I have found tho&s;e in the mother-country, as they call it. We were attacked divers times by &s;ome of them on religious &s;ubjects, but, through divine favour, were enabled to an|&s;wer them in &s;uch a manner, as that I hope
<PB N="47" REF="016793_0052_0F9E31ADAA4D9ED0">
neither we, nor the truth profe&s;&s;ed by us, &s;uffered thereby. I can &s;ay with thank|fulne&s;s, I never was at a lo&s;s in giving an&s;wers to tho&s;e that a&s;ked a rea&s;on of the hope that was in me, when I had my chief dependance on the Lord to be furni&s;hed im|mediately by him alone, without leaning to mine own under&s;tanding. We were kind|ly received by our friends at Newport on Rhode-I&s;land, where there is a large body; &s;ome of whom we found much hurt by differences and parties about government affairs; which cau&s;ed hard clo&s;e work for us in their meetings. From Rhode-I&s;land we went to the i&s;land of Nantucket, where is al&s;o a large body of friends, among&s;t whom we had good &s;atisfaction. We then returned to the main land, vi&s;iting meetings as follow|eth, viz. Sandwich, Yarmouth, Suckane&s;&s;et, and a quarterly meeting at Pembroke, where we met our friend Samuel Hopwood, who was arrived at Bo&s;ton from England a few days before, in company with Mo&s;es Aldrich, on a religious vi&s;it. From thence we went to Bo&s;ton, where we had a meeting, there being a &s;mall number of friends in the town; but truth never pro|&s;pered much there: it &s;eemed to me, that &s;omething of the &s;ame &s;pirit was yet alive, and to be felt, that formerly would have wholly extirpated our friends, and truth as held by them, from the face of the earth, and prevailed to inflict cruel &s;uffer|ings

on many of the Lord's &s;ervants, four of whom they put to death, as is related at large in a book entitled, New-England Judged, written by George Bi&s;hop, and in Sewel's Hi&s;tory of the People called Quakers. Happening to walk into the pri&s;on-yard, I ob&s;erved a very ancient building, which I judged, by its appearance, might have been the &s;ame our friends had formerly &s;uffered very great hard&s;hips in. Upon which I a&s;ked &s;ome pre&s;ent, if that was the pri&s;on their forefathers put our friends into? A woman an&s;wered, Yes; and added, 'It was a very wicked thing of the rulers of that time, for the land had &s;uffered for it ever &s;ince;' or to that import. A friend of Bo&s;ton related to me, what he &s;aid he had from an ancient inhabitant of that town, who had &s;een that wicked act of putting to death the four friends as above hinted, viz. that he could well remember fine wheat growing about and near Bo&s;ton; that he never knew nor heard of any wheat bla&s;ted, or pea&s;e eaten by bugs, until they put the Quakers to death; and that they never could rai&s;e ei|ther wheat or pea&s;e near that town &s;ince, perhaps not within 15 or 20 miles: though I &s;uppo&s;e the inhabitants were &s;o often di&s;appointed formerly, that they have not attempted to rai&s;e any lately, the land being generally turned to grazing, and for rai&s;ing Indian corn. They &s;eem &s;en&s;ible of the extraordinary alteration; but I &s;uppo&s;e few

of them are willing to attribute it to that cau&s;e. I had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with one of the inhabitants, as we were riding toge|ther near Bo&s;ton, concerning the above-mentioned wonderful event. He pretended to argue a natural cau&s;e for it; but I en|deavoured to &s;hew him, that (according to my apprehen&s;ion) tho&s;e very rea&s;ons which he advanced to prove a natural cau&s;e for the change, if they proved any thing, I thought it was directly the contrary of what he intended, viz. he urged, that clearing away the woods might have &s;o changed ther nature of the air, as to have produced a bla&s;ting quality therein. But if the airy, any thing re&s;embles the watry element herein, the freer its cour&s;e, and the le&s;s the ob&s;truction it meets with, the more it purges and purifies it&s;elf, and is therefore the le&s;s capable of producing hurtful con&s;equences either to vegetables or animals.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed on from thence, and had meetings at Lynn, Salem, Cachechy, Dover, Hampton, Haverhill, Aim&s;bury, Newbury, Taunton, Coxett, and to Dartmouth yearly-meeting, which was held there and at Aku&s;hnet four days: it was a large meeting. After which, we had meetings at Roche&s;ter, Freetown, Swan|zey, Leice&s;ter, Smithfield, Providence Woods, at one Harris's, Greenwich, South King&s;ton, Connanicut-I&s;land, Port&s;mouth, Tiverton, Little Compton, and &s;o to Newport again: divers of which meetings were large. The

Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to furni&s;h us, according to the occa&s;ion, painfully to la|bour among&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of truth in tho&s;e parts, many of whom appeared to us igno|rant, in a &s;orrowful degree, of the life and nature of true religion. Our &s;pirits were often very deeply baptized on their account, in great travail, that Chri&s;t might be formed in them. It was a very exerci&s;ing laborious journey, but the Lord mercifully made all up to us, by the comfortable enjoyment of his love and peace flowing into our hearts. Glory to his name for ever!</P>
<P>From Newport we &s;et our faces home|wards, taking We&s;terly meeting in our way, and proceeded through the colony of Con|necticut to Long-I&s;land; upon which we had meetings at Cowneck, Jo&s;eph Lea|tham's, Jericho, We&s;tbury, Matinicock, and were at the quarterly-meeting at Flu&s;hing. From thence we cro&s;&s;ed the water to We&s;t|che&s;ter on the main; got thither &s;ome time before the hour appointed for the meeting, and &s;taid a while at an inn in the town. The landlady coming into our room in a plea&s;ant manner, &s;aid, 'I &s;uppo&s;e you are travelling friends?' My an&s;wer was, We are travellers, and we are friends; therefore we are travelling friends; 'But I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid &s;he, you are preachers;' and added, 'I like your way very well, as you come up to the command of Chri&s;t, in travel|ling about as you do, more fully than our

mini&s;ters: but there is &s;omething lack|ing with you' What is that, &s;aid I? 'Why, &s;aid &s;he, you &s;hould baptize as well as preach. I then a&s;ked her what we &s;hould baptize withal. She replied, 'With water to be &s;ure; for it is not in the power of man to baptize with any thing el&s;e.' Upon which, I &s;hewed her from the holy &s;criptures, that the primitive mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t were &s;o gifted, as to be able to baptize believers into the name or power, of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t; in&s;tancing, in particular, that pa&s;&s;age of Peter at the hou&s;e of Cornelius, Acts xi. 15, 16.
<Q>And as I began to &s;peak, the Holy Gho&s;t fell on them, as on us at the beginning. Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he &s;aid, John indeed baptized with water; but ye &s;hall be baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q>
It is evident from this account, that by the effectual preaching of Peter, the Gentiles were baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t; and as the di&s;pen&s;ation of God to man is the &s;ame now it was then, and he has graciou&s;ly pro|mi&s;ed to be with his mini&s;ters always to the end of the world, and man, by nature in a fallen degenerate e&s;tate, as much involved in &s;in, and a &s;tranger to God as he was then; no good rea&s;ons can be given, why the &s;ame powerful efficacious means are not as nece&s;&s;ary for his recovery, by a reconcilia|tion with his maker, as they were at that time. The woman was very attentive to
<PB N="52" REF="016793_0057_0F9E31B44FD69C78">
what was &s;aid on the occa&s;ion, and &s;eemed pretty much affected, being quite &s;ilenced as to that &s;ubject. We invited her to our meeting; &s;he told us, it was what &s;he in|tended, and al&s;o to prevail with her hu&s;|band to go too, if &s;he could, but doubted being &s;ucce&s;sful therein. However, &s;he and her hu&s;band were both at the meeting, and the Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to give us a precious opportunity together, wherein I am per&s;uaded &s;he was made in &s;ome degree &s;en&s;ible of that baptizing power, which, in a comfortable degree, accompanied the mini&s;try that day. She was tendered, and, at parting, with tears de&s;ired us to remem|ber her and pray for her.</P>
<P>After this meeting we proceeded home|wards, taking three meetings in the Jer&s;eys as they fell in our way, viz. Elizabeth-Town, Woodbridge, and Stonybrook. I got home the 7th of the 10th month, and found my dear wife and family well, which was cau&s;e of mutual thankfulne&s;s; having per|formed near as much in about three months, as was u&s;ually done in about four. It is very nece&s;&s;ary to avoid both extremes in travelling on truth's account; neither to be over-ha&s;ty, nor too dilatory: yet I have al|ways found great &s;atisfaction and peace, in being as diligent and expeditious therein, as &s;its ea&s;y on the mind, and the con&s;titu|tion of body will bear; that all may have cau&s;e to be fully convinced, we travel not

<P>Having &s;taid at home &s;ome time, to make nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion for an increa&s;ing family, I found a concern upon my mind to vi&s;it friends a &s;econd time on Long-I&s;land and the main land in New-York govern|ment, and &s;et out in order thereunto, the 27th of the 8th month, 1743; being ac|companied by my well e&s;teemed friend, John Sykes. The fir&s;t meeting we attended on the i&s;land, was a yearly-meeting, which was held on a fir&s;t day at Matinicock. It was a large precious meeting; many not of our &s;ociety being there, the Lord was plea|&s;ed to open the doctrine of his kingdom largely, and his glorious truth was over all; to whom alone be the prai&s;e for ever! Notice was given at this meeting, of our intending to be on the next fir&s;t-day at We&s;tbury, not far from this place; and that week we had meetings at Brook|haven, I&s;lip, Bethphage, Rockaway, Henry Willis's, and &s;o to the before-mentioned meeting on fir&s;t-day. Friends came to it from divers parts of the i&s;land, and al&s;o many people of other &s;ocieties, &s;o that it was a very large meeting. Their expecta|tion
<PB N="54" REF="016793_0059_0F9E31B5C7BA8BD0">
was greatly out after words, which the ma&s;ter of our a&s;&s;emblies did not &s;ee meet to gratify; for we were almo&s;t wholly &s;hut up as to mini&s;try; which I hope proved a pro|fitable le&s;&s;on of in&s;truction to many. After this meeting we cro&s;&s;ed the water, and had meetings at We&s;tche&s;ter, Mamaroneck, Long-reach, and Ryewoods; we then returned to the i&s;land, and had meetings at Flu&s;hing, Oy&s;ter-bay, Cowneck, Flu&s;hing again, and Newtown. Having fini&s;hed our &s;ervice thereaway, we travelled homewards, taking meetings as we pa&s;&s;ed along in Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey, at Raliway, Plainfield, and Woodbridge; and in We&s;t-Jer&s;ey at Upper Springfield, and attended the quarterly-meeting at Cro&s;|wicks; after which I returned home, and have to &s;ay with thankfulne&s;s, that the Lord was to me in this little journey, &s;trength in weakne&s;s and riches in the time of poverty; and was plea&s;ed to con|duct me &s;afe to my dear wife and family in peace.</P>
<P>About the latter end of the year 1744, I found my mind drawn to vi&s;it friends meet|ings in the we&s;tern part of our county; and had meetings at Ea&s;t and We&s;t Not|tingham, Deer-Creek, New-Garden, Lon|don-Grove, Ocke&s;han, Kennet, and Con|cord. The Lord enabled me, either to do or &s;uffer, in this little journey, as the &s;ame appeared to be my duty. At Ocke&s;han I was quite &s;hut up as to words, yet had
<PB N="55" REF="016793_0060_0F9E31B6882FF668">
peace, believing it was my bu&s;ine&s;s that day, as it hath been many times &s;ince, in order (as I apprehend) to lead others into &s;ilence by example; as being the mo&s;t profitable &s;tate they or I can po&s;&s;ibly arrive at in mutability, in order to attain a right un|derdanding of all religious duties.</P>
<P>Soon after my return home, I went into We&s;t-Jer&s;ey, to vi&s;it the following meet|ings as I found my mind drawn thereunto, viz. Haddonfield, Che&s;ter, Eve&s;ham, Mount-Holly, Ancocas, Old-Springfield, Tren|ton, and Burlington quarterly-meeting, in which I had good &s;atisfaction. I think it was about this time, I went in company with my well-beloved friend Michael Light|foot, to the yearly-meetings at Cecil, and Treadhaven in Maryland, wherein we were greatly favoured. He returned home|wards from Maryland, but I went to &s;ome meetings in the lower counties of Kent and Newca&s;tle, had a meeting at Duck-Creek, and went to the yearly-meeting at Little-Creek, which was a very precious meeting, divine goodne&s;s greatly over&s;hadowing the &s;ame, to the tendering many hearts. From thence I went to George's-Creek, and New|ca&s;tle, and returned home.</P>
<P>I have no account by me, of any other journey in the &s;ervice of truth, until the 2d month 1746, that I went in company with our worthy friend before-mentioned, to the yearly-meeting at Salem, in We&s;t-Jer&s;ey; and vi&s;ited Cohan&s;ey, and Pile&s;|grove
<PB N="56" REF="016793_0061_0F9E31B75D145DD0">
meeting. In the 3d month the &s;ame year, I went to Che&s;terfield quarterly-meeting in the Jer&s;eys, and had meetings at Stony-Brook, Burlington, and Haddon|field.</P>
<P>In the 5th month the &s;ame year, I vi|&s;ited the county of Bucks, and had meet|ings at Middletown, Bri&s;tol, the Falls, Wrights-Town, Buckingham, and Plum|&s;ted; taking North-Wales meeting in my return home. The Lord was my &s;ure help and &s;ufficiency in all the&s;e journies, affording the comfortable enjoyment of &s;weet peace in my return: to whom the prai&s;e (if any &s;ervice was done) is, and I hope ever will be, freely offered up; for he alone is worthy thereof for ever!</P>
<P>Soon after my return home, great and inexpre&s;&s;ible afflictions were permitted to befal me, and my greatly afflicted family, mo&s;t of whom were &s;eized with the bloody-flux; of which di&s;temper I buried a daughter between four and five years old, and was taken very ill my&s;elf of the &s;ame di&s;order: in which time, my dear wife was deliver|ed of a child, and for a week or ten days after appeared hopeful to do well and recover; but being, in that condition, taken with the before-mentioned di&s;temper, was in a &s;hort time removed from me by death, leaving me three &s;mall children, the younge&s;t about two weeks and three days old, I found the Lord near to &s;up|port

my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed drooping &s;pirit under this great affliction. I well remember, when my dear wife lay with great &s;ymp|toms of death upon her (having al&s;o &s;ome|times, as I thought, intervals of hopeful &s;ymptoms) my mind was in a very great and painful fluctuation between hope and fear. It &s;eemed to me then impo&s;&s;ible to give her up for death, and to be wholly &s;eparated from &s;o valuable a companion; but the Lord, who formerly rebuked the winds and allayed the ragings of the &s;ea, was plea&s;ed, as in an in&s;tant, to bring an holy calmne&s;s over my mind, in which there was an intire re&s;ignation to his divine will; &s;o that I could &s;ay, with Job of old,
<Q>The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away, ble&s;&s;ed be his name.</Q>
I did not, from that time, look upon her as any more mine, but gave her up into his hands who had kindly be&s;towed her upon me. I write this by way of encouragement to others, that they may live in the fear of God, and give up in &s;teady obedience to his re|quirings; and then, I am well a&s;&s;ured, they may lean upon him in all their afflictions, and they will find to their comfort, that tho&s;e things which appear impo&s;&s;ible with man, are po&s;&s;ible with God: who will make hard things ea&s;y and bitter things &s;weet to his humble followers. She departed this life the 22d of the 7th month, 1746; we having lived together near nine years.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="016793_0063_0F9E31BBB68225B8">I have this &s;hort te&s;timony to give con|cerning my dear decea&s;ed wife; that &s;he made it her early care to lead a &s;ober and virtuous life; and I know a godly concern remained upon her mind, to keep a con|&s;cience void of offence, both towards God and man; being engaged (according to abi|lity received) for the promotion of the ble&s;&s;ed truth, and gladly entertained the Lord's faithful labourers; e&s;teeming it a ble&s;&s;ing to be favoured with their company. And when I found a concern to travel abroad in the &s;ervice of truth, &s;he freely gave me up thereunto; having, with great &s;atisfaction, to acknowledge the Lord's goodne&s;s, in favouring her with true peace and contentment in my ab&s;ence; and al&s;o, in a &s;teady tru&s;t and dependance on his providence, for our &s;upport every way in a faithful di&s;charge of duty.</P>
<P>She was favoured with great calmne&s;s and re&s;ignation to the divine will, in her la&s;t illne&s;s, either to live or die; &s;ignify|ing, that &s;he did not find any thing in the way; and that, if it plea&s;ed the Lord to remove her out of this world, &s;he hoped it would be a glorious change to her, and that &s;he &s;hould go to her little innocent babes who were gone before her; often confe&s;&s;ing the Lord's goodne&s;s in giving her &s;o much ea&s;e both of body and mind&punc; She was very loving to tho&s;e who vi&s;ited her in her illne&s;s, and &s;aid, &s;he had no|thing

but love and goodwill to all. She took her leave of our children in a very tender and affectionate manner, committing them to divine providence, and expre&s;&s;ing her belief, that his watchful care would be over them when &s;he was gone. The apprentice and &s;ervant boys were called for, at her reque&s;t; &s;he took them by the hand, and in a loving tender manner, gave them good advice; an heavenly &s;weetne&s;s accom|panying her words, which much affected tho&s;e pre&s;ent. She di&s;covered great near|ne&s;s of affection to me, to almo&s;t the very la&s;t, and &s;o departed this life in &s;weet peace, of which I was favoured, after her removal from me, with a certain evidence to my un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction; whereby I plainly &s;aw my great lo&s;s was her everla&s;ting gain, and was enabled to bow in humble ac|quie&s;cence to the divine will, who knows what is be&s;t, and orders all things in per|fect wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Being apprehen&s;ive that I &s;hould be con|cerned to travel pretty much abroad in the &s;ervice of truth, for &s;ome years; I thought it my duty, as &s;oon as I conveniently could, to place my children where they might be trained up in the way of truth, and to go my&s;elf out of bu&s;ine&s;s. This view or ap|prehen&s;ion of things, had been gradually coming upon my mind for a con&s;iderable time; but now the weight thereof much increa&s;ed; the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ime al&s;o of entering there|upon,

<P>The fir&s;t journey I entered upon, was a &s;econd vi&s;it to friends in New-England. I &s;et out in order thereunto, the 23d of the 3d month, 1747, and was at two meetings in Burlington next day. From thence I went to a quarterly-meeting at Che&s;ter|field; after which I got to Flu&s;hing on Long-I&s;land the 27th. Next day I at|tended their week-day meeting. The year|ly-meeting for that province then came on, which held four days. It was large, and the divine pre&s;ence appeared therein to our mutual comfort and &s;trength.</P>

among&s;t them; yet they appeared to me in general, a cleaner people in their mo|rals, than in many other places where I have travelled. At New-Haven in that colony, they have a college in order to train up their mini&s;ters, &amp;c. I found an inclination to go among&s;t the collegians, who gathered about me, carrying them|&s;elves civil and re&s;pectful. I had much di&s;cour&s;e and rea&s;oning with them con|cerning our principles: they appearing de|&s;irous of information, I an&s;wered their que&s;tions in a conci&s;e manner; referring them to Robert Barclay's apology (which I &s;uppo&s;ed they had in their library) for a further explanation thereof. I could not help remarking, with plea&s;ure, the becom|ing order they ob&s;erved in their que&s;tions and an&s;wers: one at once, without the lea&s;t flout, jeer, or any thing like mockery. I found work al&s;o among&s;t them, to remove the prejudice &s;ome had imbibed again&s;t us as a people, on account of the wicked and frantick behaviour and conduct of one Rogers and his followers; who, I think, dwelt about New-London in that pro|vince, calling them&s;elves Quakers; and as there were none of the right &s;ort, that people might &s;ee the difference, they were ready to conclude, that all the people cal|led Quakers were &s;uch, to the great re|proach of our &s;ociety. I declared to them, that their actions were as much abhorred
<PB N="62" REF="016793_0067_0F9E31BECD5BE818">
by us, as they could be by any people what|ever; that Rogers and his company of ran|ters were no more of our &s;ociety than they were of theirs; that it would be very hard and unju&s;t, if we, as a people, &s;hould be de|famed, by means of a crew, whom we had nothing farther to do with, than to let the world know our abhorrence of their practices, and that they took our name upon them, in all probability, as a cloak to cover their wickedne&s;s. The&s;e young &s;tudents readily admitted what I &s;aid to be very ju&s;t and rea&s;onable. I believe this opportunity tended to the reputation of our &s;ociety; and am &s;ure it was to my comfort and &s;atisfaction; feeling the love of God flow in mine heart towards tho&s;e young men, &s;ome of whom I did not think far from the kingdom. I called again to &s;ee them in my return, and gave them &s;ome books, viz. two letters written by Samuel Cri&s;p, giving rea&s;ons why he joined with the peo|ple called Quakers; a Treati&s;e on Bap|ti&s;m, by William Dell; and I think &s;ome others, but do not now particularly re|member; which they received very kindly, &s;till carrying them&s;elves re&s;pectful to me. Now I am on the&s;e remarks, I cannot well omit taking notice of the great difference ob&s;erved by me &s;ince in the nation of Eng|land, at the two great univer&s;ities, in the behaviour of the &s;tudents, whom they pre|tend to be training up for go&s;pel-mini|&s;ters,
<PB N="63" REF="016793_0068_0F9E31BF87EC36A8">
and for &s;ome other employments to get a living by. Oh! what floutings, jeer|ings, mockings, and deriding of that which is &s;erious and humble like true religion! as though to work out our &s;alvation with fear and trembling, were not now the way to the kingdom of God; but that a &s;uf|ficient a&s;&s;urance, to &s;coff at and ridicule what in the primitive church and by the people of God in all ages, was accounted religious, were now the di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of true Chri&s;tians, and mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel. How have they frequently broken in upon our peaceable quiet meetings, like the raging foaming waves of a troubled &s;ea, ca&s;ting up mire and dirt! Such a con|duct gives &s;ober di&s;cerning people, cau&s;e to look upon them as a ne&s;t of unclean birds; who, in&s;tead of promoting true re|ligion, may be in&s;trumental to &s;ubvert it. I have often wondered, &s;eeing the conduct of many of the&s;e pretended go&s;pel-mini&s;ters is obviou&s;ly &s;o very bad, not only whil&s;t they are learning the trade of preaching, but al&s;o in their following the &s;ame for a livelihood; how it comes to pa&s;s that the people bear them. One rea&s;on that appears, is, the laws of the land are much in their favour; but the principal rea&s;on is, that people, in almo&s;t a general way, are &s;tran|gers to the life and power of true religion; being &s;atisfied with a profe&s;&s;ion thereof, and having itching ears, heap to them|&s;elves
<PB N="64" REF="016793_0069_0F9E31C0B1E20500">
teachers; erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ing the principal part of religion to con&s;i&s;t in per|forming what they call religious duties&punc; as hearing &s;ermons, prayers, and &s;inging p&s;alms, &amp;c. &s;ome of the hearers being &s;o dark as to &s;ay, &s;uch a one is a good teacher, though, perhaps, a drunkard, a &s;wearer, or guilty of other evils. It is plain, that the &s;trength and &s;ecurity of &s;uch mini&s;ters, is in the darkne&s;s and ignorance of people's minds. We do not read in the Revela|tions, of the locu&s;ts coming upon the earth, until the &s;moke aro&s;e out of the bottomle&s;s pit and darkened the &s;un and air; and whenever the children of men &s;hall, in a general way, turn to the light of the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s in their own hearts, my&s;tery Babylon, the mother of harlots, mu&s;t fall, and the&s;e her merchants will be wholly rejected. All their abominable craft will be fully di&s;covered. Great will be their torment, fear, and di&s;tre&s;s in that day! The Lord Almighty ha&s;ten the time for his own name's &s;ake, when all craft violence, and &s;hedding of human blood may be at an end; and righteou&s;ne&s;s cover the earth, as water covers the &s;ea!</P>
<P>Some of the inhabitants of New-Haven &s;ignified their de&s;ire that we &s;hould appoint a meeting there, but we did not find &s;uf|ficient &s;trength and courage to an&s;wer their reque&s;t; &s;o proceeded on our journey, and got to Newport, on Rhode-I&s;land, the 8th
<PB N="65" REF="016793_0070_0F9E31C3ADC0CC90">
of the 7th month. Here we were kindly received by friends, and attended their yearly-meeting, which begun at Port&s;|mouth, where it held only one day, being a meeting for wor&s;hip; after which, the meetings for wor&s;hip and bu&s;ine&s;s were held four days at Newport: they were very large and divinely favoured, &s;o that tho&s;e who depended on the Lord alone for wi&s;|dom and &s;trength, were enabled to come up in the di&s;charge of their re&s;pective duties, to their peace and comfort. When this great meeting was over, I had meetings at Tiverton, Little Compton, Accoake&s;et, and Aponygan&s;et, on fir&s;t-day, and was at their monthly-meeting on &s;econd-day. Next morning, about eight o'clock, I went on board a ve&s;&s;el bound to the i&s;land of Nan|tucket, John Hanes ma&s;ter, where we ar|rived about one o'clock next morning. I &s;taid upon this i&s;land about &s;ix days, and was at their yearly and monthly-meetings; having good &s;atisfaction therein. I re|turned in the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el, and landed on the continent in about &s;ix hours; had a meeting at Falmouth, and went to their monthly-meeting at Sandwich, and attend|ed the quarterly-meeting which was held there. Here I met with divers friends from our parts who were on the &s;ervice of truth. We had very clo&s;e &s;earching laborious &s;er|vice among&s;t them, as things were very low and much out of order; in part owing to
<PB N="66" REF="016793_0071_0F9E31C4E6308510">
the neglect of &s;ome members who&s;e minds had been too much taken up with earthly things to watch over the flock, as tho&s;e who mu&s;t give an account. We endeavour|ed to lay the weight of things more clo&s;ely upon the active members, and le&s;t them to the Lord's dealings; knowing,
<Q>that al|though Paul may plant, and Apollos may water, it is he alone that can give the increase.</Q></P>
<P>I went from thence to Pembroke, where I had a meeting; and through Bo&s;ton to Lynn, where I had a meeting al&s;o; thence to Salem monthly-meeting, and returned to Bo&s;ton, and had two meetings there, being fir&s;t-day. From thence I went directly to Rhode-I&s;land, and had meetings at Port&s;|mouth, and Newport, to good &s;atisfaction: the Lord giving power and dominion, by the ble&s;&s;ed efficacy of his pure word of life, over all of a contrary nature to it&s;elf, whereby I was enabled to clear my mind, to my great ea&s;e and comfort. I then re|turned homewards with much &s;atisfaction and peace of mind; taking meetings in my way at Connanicut-I&s;land, and South King&s;ton; &s;o proceeded on my journey through Connecticut, and lodged at New-Haven. I &s;pent part of a day in conver|&s;ation, and rea&s;oning with &s;ome well di&s;|po&s;ed people, to &s;atisfaction. I al&s;o vi&s;ited the &s;tudents as before hinted; after which I proceeded on my journey to Long-Reach,
<PB N="67" REF="016793_0072_0F9E31C594D96AE8">
where I had a meeting, and went to the year|ly-meeting at We&s;t-Che&s;ter. From thence I travelled homewards, having, as hereto|fore, cau&s;e to be humbly thankful to the fountain of all goodne&s;s, who was near to help as the eye was &s;ingle to him, in all proving times, whether in heights or depths; and as he was waited upon, gave wi&s;dom and utterance. I de&s;ire he alone may for ever have the prai&s;e and glory, if any good is done; as there is no good but what proceeds from him. I had not been long returned from the before-mentioned jour|ney, when I laid before the monthly-meeting I belonged to, a concern which had been upon my mind &s;ome years, to vi&s;it the churches in divers parts of Great-Britain and Ireland; de&s;iring their con|currence and certificate, if, upon weighty deliberation, they found unity with my propo&s;al; intimating the time for entering upon that &s;olemn undertaking had appeared to me for &s;ome time to be drawing near, and that I &s;hould look out for a pa&s;&s;age before the end of the year. A certifi|cate was prepared, &s;etting forth their unity with my &s;ervice in the mini&s;try, and with my intended journey; de&s;iring my la|bours therein might tend to the edifica|tion of the churches where my lot &s;hould be ca&s;t, and for my return to them again in peace; al&s;o expre&s;&s;ing that I had &s;et|tled my outward affairs to the &s;atisfaction
<PB N="68" REF="016793_0073_0F9E31C6DD8D9128">
of that meeting: for I had acquainted friends how I had &s;ettled them, as I thought it concerned them to be &s;atisfied in that, as well as other things; it being my ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire to have the full concurrence of my brethren in &s;o great an under|taking.</P>
<P>I took &s;ome little turns in vi&s;iting adja|cent meetings; and before the yearly-meet|ing came on, I went to North-Wales meet|ing, and about twenty miles further up the country to Richland, in order to take my leave of &s;ome friends and relations, as well as to vi&s;it that meeting. In my re|turn homewards I was taken very ill of what is there called the yellow fever; be|cau&s;e the patient is thereby turned as yellow as if he had the jaundice. I reached to the hou&s;e of my worthy friend, Thomas Foulke, who, with his good wife and children, were as affectionately kind to me as if I had been one of their neare&s;t relations. But this malignant fever greatly increa&s;ed upon me. My &s;i&s;ter was &s;ent for, and &s;everal doctors were employed. Tho&s;e who &s;aw me concluded all was over, and that I mu&s;t depart out of this life. I look little no|tice of any thing; yet I think I was for the mo&s;t part &s;en&s;ible, and could perceive I was given up for death, by tho&s;e who had the care of me. Once they thought I was near drawing my la&s;t breath; they therefore drew a pillow from under my head, and
<PB N="69" REF="016793_0074_0F9E31C713439460">
unbuttoned the neckband of my &s;hirt, out of kindne&s;s, to make the la&s;t &s;truggle be|tween life and death the ea&s;ier. For my part, I could not &s;ee how it would go with me; but had not much, if any apprehen|&s;ion of being taken away by death at that time. This &s;ore illne&s;s happening in the yearly-meeting time, which was held that year at Philadelphia, I reque&s;ted the cer|tificate I had obtained of the monthly-meeting, for my intended journey into Eng|land, &amp;c. might be laid before the yearly-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders (as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es) for the concurrence of friends; and if they found freedom and unity there|with, to &s;ignify the &s;ame to the brethren in England, by an indor&s;ement thereon. It was laid before the &s;aid meeting by my good friend Michael Lightfoot, and the meetings free concurrence obtained; it was &s;igned by a very great number of friends. This was done when many thought there would be no occa&s;ion for a certificate, as they fully expected it was near over with me, as to this world. But I was not ea&s;y to mi&s;s &s;o good an opportunity of having a concern of &s;o great importance &s;olidly weigh|ed by &s;uch a &s;ub&s;tantial body of friends; as I was not likely to have &s;uch another opportunity, if the Lord &s;hould be plea&s;ed to rai&s;e me up again. This &s;ore illne&s;s brought me very low indeed, &s;o that when the fever abated, and I was fit to be helped
<PB N="70" REF="016793_0075_0F9E31C7DE7228B0">
out of bed, I could not &s;tand alone; yet I recovered to admiration; being able, in about a week, to ride home in a chai&s;e, about twenty-&s;ix miles; which I bore very well. On my return home, my friends and neighbours came to &s;ee me, greatly rejoice|ing at my recovery, which they did not expect from what &s;ome had &s;een and others had heard, for &s;everal of them vi&s;ited me in my illne&s;s. This was a time of deep probation to me both inwardly and out|wardly; being tried, as I &s;ometimes have been when great weakne&s;s of body hath been upon me, with &s;ore and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing poverty of &s;pirit; not having di&s;tinct &s;atis|faction and clearne&s;s in my own mind how it was with me as to my inward con|dition, judging an evidence of peace and comfort from the holy &s;pirit would be a wonderful &s;upport at &s;uch times of bodily affliction; and have found it &s;o, when it hath plea&s;ed the Lord to favour me there|with. But he knows what is be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;uitable for us; and therefore I find by ex|perience, it is the &s;afe&s;t way to re&s;ign our wills to his holy will; as we mu&s;t, for the mo&s;t part, whil&s;t in this militant &s;tate, walk by faith, and not by &s;ight. I am fully per&s;uaded &s;uch trying di&s;pen&s;ations of di|vine providence to us, are greatly profitable for our growth in the way that is well plea&s;ing to him; and if patiently borne, will, in his time, be a means to work for
<PB N="71" REF="016793_0076_0F9E31C8CB73DE98">
us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</P>
<P>Soon after my health was re&s;tored, an ancient friend who&s;e name was Peter Davis, from New-England, came to Phi|ladelphia in order to take a pa&s;&s;age for England, and our friend Thomas Gawthrop having performed a religious vi&s;it to friends on the continent of America, intending to embark &s;hortly for the &s;ame, with I&s;aac Greenleaf a friend on trade, I joined them; all agreeing to take our pa&s;&s;age in a new &s;hip bound for London.</P>
<P>One thing I would ju&s;t remark, that &s;ome friends, and, as I under&s;tood, &s;ome others al&s;o, taking notice how providentially publick friends had been pre&s;erved during the war which was then with France and Spain, &s;o that none of them had been taken by the enemy, did pre&s;ume thereon; and would &s;ay There is no need to in&s;ure goods in that &s;hip, as &s;o many publick friends are going in her, &s;he will doubt|le&s;s go &s;afe. I much di&s;liked this (as I thought) inju&s;tifiable confidence, &s;eeing the judgments of the Lord are a great deep, being un&s;earchable, and his ways pa&s;t our finding out. It becomes us in all our undertakings, to commit our&s;elves and all we have into his hands, in humble re|&s;ignation to do or &s;uffer whatever his wi&s;|dom may point out or permit to fall upon us, for the trial of our faith and
<PB N="72" REF="016793_0077_0F9E31C947E76448">
patience; as his mercy, power, and goodne&s;s are as con&s;picuous in pre&s;erving, defending, and carrying us through great and uncom|mon probations to his glory, con&s;equently to our own advantage in the end, as in wholly exempting us from them. Even Job had no cau&s;e to complain of his un|parallelled afflictions, when they were over and he &s;aw how greatly he had profited thereby. A friend &s;aid to me before we embarked, he did not pretend to determine whether we &s;hould be taken or not; but however that might happen, he did be|lieve &s;ome friends in our &s;tation would be taken: not only to check that unwarrantable confidence in &s;ome, both friends and others, but he al&s;o apprehended, a &s;ervice might ari&s;e from &s;uch being ca&s;t among&s;t tho&s;e dark people, though again&s;t their will. I did not pretend any a&s;&s;urance in my own mind, of pre&s;ervation out of the enemies hands; but was made willing to commit my &s;oul, body, and all that I had unto the Lord, as into the hands of a faithful Creator, not doubting the &s;ufficiency of his power for pre&s;ervation in every condition of life.</P>
<P>On the 30th of the 9th month 1747, the before-mentioned friends, who were to be my companions upon the mighty ocean, &s;et out from Philadelphia in order to em|bark at Che&s;ter, in company with many friends, and called for me at my hou&s;e in Derby, being the direct road. My&s;elf,
<PB N="73" REF="016793_0078_0F9E31CDBB745A28">
and a con&s;iderable number of friends and neighbours joined them, and proceeded to Che&s;ter that night; where, at the hou&s;e of our ancient friend Grace Lloyd, we had a &s;olemn meeting. Next day, being the 1&s;t of the 10th month, about two o'clock in the afternoon, we took leave of friends in great love and tenderne&s;s, and went on board the &s;hip, which fell down the river that evening a little lower than Newca&s;tle. Next day in the evening, we came to an anchor near Reedy-I&s;land, where we were detained by a great &s;torm of wind and rain until the 5th in the morning, when we &s;et &s;ail with a fair wind, taking our depar|ture from the Capes of the Delaware about &s;ix the &s;ame evening. The wind continued fair for the mo&s;t part, though very &s;trong, and a following &s;ea running exceeding high until the 18th; when, according to their calculation, we had run about two-thirds of our pa&s;&s;age; &s;eldom having more than a fore&s;ail &s;et, and that &s;ometimes reefed, and at other times double reefed. As we had &s;uch a high following &s;ea, it was thought the &s;hip was a-head of their reckoning. From the 18th to the 23d the wind con|tinued pretty fair, but more moderate than before. Then it turned about to the ea&s;t|ward and blew exceeding hard, with a very high &s;ea, until the 29th, in which time we lay to, and drove about wither&s;oever the wind and waves could carry us. We could
<PB N="74" REF="016793_0079_0F9E31CEF1972508">
get very little or nothing forward, but were exceedingly to&s;&s;ed. This was indeed a very trying time; the motion of the waves was &s;o violent, that though &s;he was a &s;trong new &s;hip, &s;he was beat upon with &s;o much force as to make her crack from end to end in a &s;hocking manner, as if &s;he would have been broken to pieces. I then thought tho&s;e in my &s;ituation had good rea&s;on to know well what they were about, and what they expo&s;ed them&s;elves to &s;uch dangers for; that they had great need to have the mighty Ruler of the &s;ea and land for their friend. For if he had been plea&s;ed to withdraw his protection, there was only about a two-inch plank between us and eternity, which was to me very awful at that time to think of; for I was not without my to&s;&s;ings and combats of mind, at times, during the&s;e out|ward probations. The 29th proved a fine day, &s;o that they had a good ob&s;ervation, and judged we were then about an hundred and fifty leagues from the Land's-End of England. Next day, being the 30th of the 10th month, Thomas Gawthrop having had a very re&s;tle&s;s painful night, by trouble&s;ome dreams, &amp;c. had &s;ome expectation of our being taken (as he afterwards intimated) he &s;tepped upon deck about eight o'clock in the morning, and immediately e&s;pied a &s;ail upon our windward quarter, giving us chace. He quickly rai&s;ed the carele&s;s captain, who ought to have been looking out before
<PB N="75" REF="016793_0080_0F9E31D041FE4100">
that time, and to have watched more nar|rowly than he did, con&s;idering the tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in him. The captain, when he per|ceived we were cha&s;ed, appeared much con|cerned, giving the &s;hip up for taken in his mind already. We urged him to put out all the &s;ail he could croud, and to exert his utmo&s;t endeavour to e&s;cape, offering to a&s;&s;i&s;t all in our power, as we often had done before, being very poorly manned; in part owing to the &s;ailors unwillingne&s;s to go into &s;hips bound to London, le&s;t they &s;hould be pre&s;&s;ed on board men of war. It happened to be a moderate wind, &s;o that we could have borne all the &s;ail belonging to the &s;hip; but through neglect before, neither topgallant-&s;ails nor &s;teering-&s;ails were in a condition to be &s;et; neither would the captain be prevailed upon to have a reef taken out of the main&s;ail. The ve&s;&s;el was very badly &s;teered, as the French remarked when they had taken us. The captain ordered her to be clo&s;e hauled to the wind, vainly hoping, as he intimated, we &s;hould get to the windward of them, being deeply laden. But this was very ill judged, if really the effect of judgment, as the way of the &s;hip was thereby much hindered to what it would have been if &s;he had gone large, taking the &s;trength of the wind. Notwith&s;tanding this, we held the privateer in cha&s;e about nine hours. She came up with us about five o'clock in
<PB N="76" REF="016793_0081_0F9E31D0C8030298">
the evening, and fired a gun under French colours; upon which our people lowered their colours and top&s;ail, by way of &s;ub|mitting to them. They hoi&s;ted out a &s;mall boat to &s;ea, the &s;ea running high, in which came the &s;econd captain and a lieutenant with &s;even or eight &s;ailors, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very valuable prize. She was a &s;now privateer belonging to Bayonne, carrying ten carriage guns, and about one hundred men, commanded by one Peter Garalon. As the boat was rowing towards us, the people therein made &s;uch a dark, mean, and contemptible appearance, that our poor &s;ailors cried out in a very mournful affect|ing manner, We &s;hall all be u&s;ed very bad and cruelly, like dogs, for they are a piti|ful crew, and no officer among&s;t them: but in this they were mi&s;taken. For my part, the Lord being exceeding gracious to my &s;oul, by the ble&s;&s;ed &s;upport and &s;olacing comfort of his holy &s;pirit, all that day I was quite calm and ea&s;y: all fear of the enemy or whatever I might have to pa&s;s through in &s;uch a time of trial, was wholly taken away for the pre&s;ent; my mind being filled with humble re&s;ignation to the divine will; yet was willing, as I thought it a point of prudence, to u&s;e endeavours for e&s;caping out of their hand if it were prac|ticable.</P>
<P>The before-mentioned &s;econd captain of the privateer, who&s;e name was Andrew De
<PB N="77" REF="016793_0082_0F9E31D18BE56518">
St. Andrew, boarded us with a naked cutla&s;s in his hand, eight or nine men following him. He &s;poke to us in good Engli&s;h very chearfully, &s;aying to this effect, 'Your &s;ervant gentlemen; it is the fortune of the war, although it is ours to day, it may be yours to-morrow; and promi&s;ed good u&s;age. He then ordered the captain, mate, and &s;ailors, except two, and we who were cabin pa&s;&s;engers, being ten in number, to go on board the privateer; upon which the boat was loaded and went off. He took notice that we were of the people called Quakers; by which he gave us to under&s;tand that he was not altogether a &s;tranger to us as a peo|ple. The chief rea&s;on of &s;ending away tho&s;e on board a prize being for their own &s;ecurity, le&s;t there might be danger of their ri&s;ing and recovering the &s;hip again, we conceived &s;ome hopes, from the known peaceable principles we profe&s;s, to be &s;o far indulged as to have remained on board the prize; and therefore did not incline to go with the fir&s;t boat-full; making u&s;e of that &s;pace of time in an earne&s;t &s;olicitation to remain there, having much better accommodation than we could rea&s;on|ably expect on board the privateer; but all the arguments we could advance &s;eemed ineffectual. When the boat returned, he &s;till urged the orders he had from the head captain to &s;end us all on board: upon which I &s;tepped over the &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el,

taking hold of the hand-rope, with a de&s;ign to go into the boat: when there, it ap|peared to me exceedingly hazardous, the &s;ea running very high. I turned about and looked this French captain full in the face, and expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in as moving terms as I was capable of, concerning the danger he was about expo&s;ing us to unnece&s;&s;arily; which, through divine favour, took &s;uch impre&s;&s;ion upon him, that he took me by the hand and drew me into the &s;hip again, &s;aying, You &s;hall &s;tay here to night how|ever. He had before demanded the keys of our che&s;ts, under pretence it was to prevent their falling into the hands of the common men, whereby they might plunder our che&s;ts; but the true rea&s;on was, that he and the other officers might do it them&s;elves fir&s;t; which they did after we were gone to-bed that night, returning our keys next morning, with large promi&s;es of protection and good u&s;age; which, every thing con|&s;idered, they in a good degree fulfil<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">d. We could not help looking upon it as a kind providence, which made way for our remaining on board the prize; having there the free u&s;e of our private &s;tores, and being better waited upon than before we were taken, having two cabin boys for that pur|po&s;e. Captain Andrew, to give him his due, carried him&s;elf re&s;pectfully to us; fre|quently filling our plates plentifully, though he might, at times, have le&s;s left for him|&s;elf;
<PB N="79" REF="016793_0084_0F9E31D348F7AF50">
and when he wanted any liquors or other provi&s;ions out of our che&s;ts, he would a&s;k us for them in a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive man|ner, as if he had no authority to demand. This kind carriage of his gained much upon us, to place &s;ome confidence in him, which in the end he made u&s;e of to his own advantage, by craftily getting from us to the amount of about &pound; 200 &s;terling, the particulars of which would be too tedious to relate. After the French had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our &s;hip, they put her in a fine trim for &s;ailing, &s;o that it was plain &s;he could out&s;ail the privateer that took her by much. Captain Andrew informed us, we were, when they took us, about eighty leagues from Cape-Clear in Ireland, and about one hundred and twenty-five leagues from the Land's-End of England.</P>
<P>The next day came on board the chief captain, to examine the cargo, &amp;c. He made this Andrew captain of the prize, of which we were glad, as he could &s;peak Engli&s;h well, and from what we could conceive of him, there was rea&s;on to expert favourable u&s;age under his care; which was al&s;o pro|mi&s;ed us by the head captain. They found the cargo &s;o valuable that it was concluded the privateer &s;hould keep us company, in order to convoy us &s;afe to &s;ome port of France or Spain. Now having new ma&s;ters, we had a new cour&s;e to &s;teer; but the wind &s;et again&s;t us, blowing very hard and
<PB N="80" REF="016793_0085_0F9E31D790B7DC88">
&s;tormy. We lay to often, and were ex|ceedingly to&s;&s;ed for the mo&s;t part, for about two weeks, and did not in that time think our&s;elves any nearer Bayonne than when we were taken. They wanted more prey, therefore e&s;pied and cha&s;ed &s;everal ve&s;&s;els, who had the good &s;ucce&s;s to get away from them. We were once cha&s;ed our&s;elves, by a fine large &s;hip; they took her to be an Engli&s;h man of war, and appeared to be greatly alarmed; but when &s;he came up, they found her to be a privateer belonging to the town called St. Maloes, carrying twenty carriage guns and about three hun|dred men. We left the privateer that took us, a great way during this chace, our &s;hip being fixed upon at a great di&s;tance, for the be&s;t booty.</P>
<P>It was the 22d of the 11th month before we &s;aw any land, and when we did, they proved much mi&s;taken, thinking them&s;elves &s;ixty or &s;eventy leagues nearer Bayonne than they, upon better information, found. We had plea&s;ant &s;ailing near the land on the Spani&s;h Coa&s;t which borders on the Bay of Bi&s;cay; it being high land, afforded con|&s;iderable delight to us, as we had been long confined to the &s;ight of water only. The 24th in the du&s;k of the evening, we had near entered the port called St. Seba&s;tian, when the wind chopped in right a-head and drove us out to &s;ea again. The pri|vateer got into a place called Port-Pa&s;&s;age,
<PB N="81" REF="016793_0086_0F9E31D875BE1268">
about a league from thence, next morning early. But we, being forced farther off by contrary winds, had great difficulty to get in that day, being for many hours towed by fifteen boats, in which were one hundred and fifty men labouring at their oars. They appeared very anxious to get our ve&s;&s;el into &s;ome port, as they feared &s;ome Engli&s;h &s;hip cruizing in the Bay, might call them to an account. We poor captives went on &s;hore the 26th in the morning, being glad and thankful to have the opportunity of &s;etting our feet again on firm land, although in an enemy's country; for, &s;etting a&s;ide the great affliction of being taken by an enemy, it had been an exceeding rough boi&s;terous trying pa&s;&s;age, of about eight weeks. It was very mild &s;pring-like weather there, though about the middle of winter. We diverted our&s;elves with walking about in the day, and lodged aboard at night, whil&s;t we &s;taid in that &s;mall place, which was till the 29th, when hor&s;es were pro|vided for us to travel by land, about thirty miles, to Bayonne; the doctor of the pri|vateer being all the guard and guide we had. There was a very plentiful dinner provided for us at a &s;ea-port town in France called St. Jean-de-Luz. I was not at all plea&s;ed with the forward wanton car|riage of the women; &s;uch as I had never &s;een before: I reproved them, but &s;ome, by way of excu&s;e, &s;aid, the principal
<PB N="82" REF="016793_0087_0F9E31D9E79FF778">
thing they intended thereby, was to cheer up our &s;pirits in our captivated &s;tate; yet I could hardly believe their de&s;ign was &s;o innocent.</P>
<P>We had been told by Captain Andrew, that on our arrival at Bayonne, we that were cabin-pa&s;&s;engers &s;hould immediately have a parole of honour granted us; but we did not find it &s;o. Being brought be|fore the commi&s;&s;ary, he ordered us to be taken into the ca&s;tle; yet we had the liber|ty there to hire rooms, with beds in them (&s;uch as they were,) and to have provi&s;ions for our money; of which we &s;oon found we had need to be well &s;tored, as they had a notable knack of getting it from us; for we could not buy any thing our&s;elves, but all mu&s;t come through the hands of &s;uch as knew how to make a property of us. I never knew any people &s;o thorough|ly furni&s;hed with artful ways to get money, as the French. Their tongues were very much at command, and they could u&s;e them with great wit and addre&s;s in order to gain our good opinion of them, but I never perceived they meant any thing el&s;e in the main thereby, but advantage to them&s;elves; and therefore, &s;aw it nece&s;&s;ary to be as much as I could on my guard. We were very much impo&s;ed upon on account of provi&s;ions, and our money went very fa&s;t. Not being quite without fear, if they &s;hould di&s;cover we had &s;ufficient, &s;ome other
<PB N="83" REF="016793_0088_0F9E31DA8B72C558">
way might be found out to get it from us, we made inquiry whether any could be found willing to &s;upply us with money, and take our draught upon Lon|don, allowing them a premium. We &s;oon found they were very willing to do it, merely upon the credit of our &s;ociety; &s;uch reputation hath the real po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of truth gained our friends, far and wide; but, to our &s;orrow, the bare profe&s;&s;ion of it, in divers mournful in&s;tances of late, hath produced quite the contrary effect; &s;o that there hath been rea&s;on to fear, the great credit gained by our worthy pre|dece&s;&s;ors for ju&s;tice and punctuality, is in danger of being, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, lo&s;t to the &s;ociety, by the mi&s;conduct of &s;ome of their de&s;cendants. They told us, that di|vers of the people called Quakers had been among&s;t them, but they were not like us; that they looked upon us to be preci&s;e &s;tiff Quakers; but tho&s;e who had been there before, behaved in a complai&s;ant man|ner, not &s;ticking at the punctilio of the hat, &amp;c. We let them know, that our be|haviour in tho&s;e re&s;pects, was no other than what is con&s;i&s;tent with our principles; that we could not an&s;wer for tho&s;e who were hypocrites, profe&s;&s;ing one thing and prac|ti&s;ing another. We could di&s;cover, that upon all occa&s;ions, they &s;eemed to have a greater dependance on our veracity, than that of the re&s;t of our company; and upon
<PB N="84" REF="016793_0089_0F9E31DB4EF2FEF0">
the whole, &s;hewed us full as much, if not more kindne&s;s. Our confinement and u&s;age in the ca&s;tle grew very di&s;agreeable to us; we therefore took the opportunity, when the commi&s;&s;ary came (which we under&s;tood was u&s;ually once a week) to lay before him the treatment we met with, and to reque&s;t our liberty upon parole. He pretended to make &s;ome difficulty of it, and we found many then in the ca&s;tle had been endeavour|ing &s;ome time to procure that liberty and could not. But when we di&s;covered danger of being put off, as they had been, we pre&s;&s;|ed it upon him with more earne&s;tne&s;s. Hereupon we had a parole of honour granted for upwards of twenty. The place fixed upon for our re&s;idence was Dax, an ancient town about forty miles up Bayonne River. We were &s;ent thi|ther by water, and were in the boat all night, having very di&s;agreeable company, the wor&s;t of whom were Engli&s;h and Scotch. The&s;e had laid a &s;cheme to pre|vent our being admitted into the &s;ame boat, which was very ungrateful in them, as they knew we had been the principal in&s;tru|ments of procuring that liberty, e&s;pecially for &s;ome of them. Without doubt, their rea&s;on for that attempt was, that they might enjoy the intended frolick, without any rebuke or interruption from us. We bore their filthy ob&s;cene di&s;cour&s;e and behaviour
<PB N="85" REF="016793_0090_0F9E31DC58AD2380">
for &s;ome time; but, at length, being exceed|ingly burdened, Thomas Gawthrop and I were concerned to reprove them very &s;everely, de&s;iring them to con&s;ider, what the French people in the boat could think of tho&s;e who called them&s;elves Prote&s;tants. Some of them &s;eemed at fir&s;t to retort, but the weight of our &s;pirits came over them; we being on truth's &s;ide, which is &s;tronge&s;t of all, they were &s;oon overcome and &s;ilenced. From that time we kept them at a di&s;tance, not look|ing upon them worthy of our notice in a way of intimacy, &s;o that when we came to Dax, we &s;eparated from them, boarding by our&s;elves. On our arrival there, we were brought before the governor of the ca&s;tle; and our manner of appearing before our &s;uperiors being different from that of others, with which we did not expect he was acquainted, and might probably put an unfavourable con&s;truction upon; we there|fore de&s;ired our interpreter to inform him, that we did not &s;tand before him covered in contempt, or any ways in di&s;re&s;pect, it being our principle and practice &s;o to ap|pear before our &s;uperiors in our own nation. His an&s;wer was to this effect, viz. 'I am not at all offended with their appearance; I know &s;omething of tho&s;e people.' He gave us the liberty of the town and country around; and we got pretty good quarters,
<PB N="86" REF="016793_0091_0F9E31DCC80D5B08">
and lived much more to our minds than in Bayonne Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>This town is now a mean place, but there are &s;till remains of its ancient great|ne&s;s. I find by hi&s;tory, it was once the capital of Aquitaine, and was then called Aqua Solis, from its hot waters. At one place I found the heat &s;o &s;urprizingly great, that I could not bear my fingers in the water a quarter of a minute. This water was inclo&s;ed with &s;tone walls of about twenty yards &s;quare, having bra&s;s or iron cocks or &s;pouts, to convey water for the u&s;e of the inhabitants; it an&s;wering the purpo&s;e of boiling water for wa&s;hing linen, &amp;c. There ari&s;es a &s;team or &s;moke therefrom, like unto a va&s;t furnace or lime-kiln. We being there in Lent-time (as they call it) were told the prie&s;ts were unea&s;y at our being indulged with fle&s;h, and that they reque&s;ted the governor to give orders for preventing it. We were informed that he turned very &s;hort upon them, and &s;aid, 'I will give no &s;uch orders. What have they to do with your Lent? Cannot you be contented to keep it your&s;elves?' He carried him&s;elf very civilly to us, and came once in per&s;on to invite us to a bull-bating, offering, as we were &s;trangers, to prefer us to the be&s;t place for the purpo&s;e of &s;eeing, which was the balcony in the front of his hou&s;e. We acknowledged his civility, but at the &s;ame
<PB N="87" REF="016793_0092_0F9E31E113744920">
time gave him to under&s;tand, we did not allow our&s;elves to attend &s;uch kind of diver&s;ions. I under&s;tood they bait bulls there with men in&s;tead of dogs; but I did not &s;ee it.</P>
<P>There are many wor&s;hip-hou&s;es, and two nunneries in Dax. Their clergy, of vari|ous orders, &s;warm like locu&s;ts, who fleece the people to that degree, that it may be truly &s;aid, of much the greater part, they are in a &s;tate of abject poverty and va&s;&s;al-age; &s;tupidly devoted to follow the&s;e blind guides wither&s;oever they think proper to lead them, not daring to judge at all for them&s;elves in matters of religion. Oh, happy England! Oh, land ble&s;&s;ed with liberty! What ha&s;t thou not to an&s;wer for, if right u&s;e be not made of &s;o great a privilege?</P>
<P>We went one day to vi&s;it and conver&s;e with the nuns, which we did through large iron grates, by an interpreter. They beha|ved them&s;elves very civil, courteous, and free in di&s;cour&s;e. One of the &s;i&s;ters lay dead in an apartment. The corp&s;e was laid in a coffin dre&s;&s;ed in black, having twelve wax candles lighted and &s;et in &s;ilver can|dle&s;ticks, &s;ix on each &s;ide, and &s;ome at her feet, and a black cro&s;s fixed between her fingers on her brea&s;t, as if &s;he was look|ing at it. Several of the nuns were about her, &s;ome kneeling, and others &s;itting on
<PB N="88" REF="016793_0093_0F9E31E25C563620">
the floor, with books in their hands, pray|ing for the &s;oul departed, as we conjectured. One was ringing a bell, perhaps it was what they call a holy bell, that at the &s;ound thereof all the evil &s;pirits might be cha&s;ed out of the &s;oul's way in its flight towards the other world. We went from this to the other nunnery, but could not be imme|diately admitted to &s;ee the nuns, as they were employed in &s;inging p&s;alms or &s;ome kind of religious &s;ongs, which we could hear at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance: it was thought by &s;ome of the company, the fine&s;t mu&s;ick they ever heard; but I neither am, nor de&s;ire to be, a judge thereof. We &s;tood in an open entry before a fine chapel, but did not go into it, though the door was open; for indeed I had no freedom to go into any of their idols temples, yet we could &s;ee many upon their knees praying, &s;ome before one image, and &s;ome before ano|ther. As we waited here, not intending nor expecting to give any offence, it being an open entry (but I &s;uppo&s;e it was hal|lowed, or con&s;ecrated, as they call it, though not di&s;covered to be &s;o by us,) there came a monk to us in a great pa&s;&s;ion, and talked very fa&s;t in French. We &s;aw he was angry, but did not under&s;tand what he &s;aid, and therefore a&s;ked the interpreters, hav|ing, I think, two with us then. They told us, he &s;aid we had polluted that holy place,
<PB N="89" REF="016793_0094_0F9E31E2CD2EDCD8">
viz. in keeping our hats on, ina&s;much as their Lord God was there; that if we had no more manners, they had a way to teach us better. We then departed, being depri|ved of the intended vi&s;it to the nuns, but that was no great di&s;appointment. Their cro&s;&s;es, either of wood or &s;tone, are very numerous, being erected in all the cro&s;s roads, and al&s;o at many places in and about their towns and villages; on &s;ome of which images are fa&s;tened, with an imitation of the crown of thorns, the reed, &s;pear, and &s;punge. That the people's great poverty may more fully appear, I &s;hall give a &s;hort de&s;cription of the &s;hoes mo&s;t of them wear, who wear any &s;ort: they are wholly made of wood, being hollowed out for the feet, except a piece of leather about three inches broad, acro&s;s the in&s;tep. They appear very inconvenient to walk in, as they do not yield at all to the feet. I am per&s;uaded there is not one in &s;ixty, in that part of France, who wear any other &s;ort of &s;hoes. Many waggon loads of the&s;e &s;hoes are brought to Dax market every week.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t of the 12th month, a me&s;&s;en|ger from Bayonne brought us the agreeable news of a cartel-&s;hip from England being arrived at Port-Pa&s;&s;age. An order came &s;oon after for our return, and that we might be ready to embark therein the 24th. We hired a boat for that purpo&s;e, and went
<PB N="90" REF="016793_0095_0F9E31E3887607E8">
in her to Bayonne, being on the water all night. It was very cold &s;nowy weather, and I &s;uffered much thereby, taking a great cold, which I did not get over for many days. What &s;till added to our di&s;tre&s;s, was the commi&s;&s;ary's receiving us very roughly, and ordering us into the ca&s;tle again. I know of no rea&s;on he had for being in that ill-natured di&s;po&s;ition; neither do I re|member he gave us any. I was ready to imagine it was only to furni&s;h a pretence to get &s;omething into his own pocket by our confinement. One thing made me think he had a feeling in the profits there, was his unwillingne&s;s to give us and others, a parole. However, when it appeared that we mu&s;t go to pri&s;on again, the captain of the before-mentioned cartel &s;hip being pre&s;ent, demanded our liberty; which I &s;uppo&s;e the commi&s;&s;ary dur&s;t not deny him; by which means we had the liberty of the town a few days, until matters were &s;ettled for our travelling to|wards the &s;hip.</P>
<P>One thing I am not willing to omit, as it will be a &s;pecimen of the unaccount|able &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry of tho&s;e peo|ple among&s;t whom our lot was ca&s;t, Tho|mas Gawthrop and I taking a walk, as we often did, into the fields, came to a &s;mall building, which was &s;omewhat in the na|ture of a conduit, as there i&s;&s;ued out at one
<PB N="91" REF="016793_0096_0F9E31E4488D9B10">
end, &s;pouts of water, over which was enclo|&s;ed, in net-work, an image who&s;e head &s;eemed as if cut off or &s;evered from his body. It appeared to be a fine &s;pring of water; but that which came mo&s;t under our no|tice was, to ob&s;erve &s;o many wor&s;hipping this water and beheaded image: I &s;uppo&s;e not le&s;s than fifteen on their knees, &s;ome much nearer thereunto than others. We inquired the meaning thereof; but none under&s;tood Engli&s;h, nor we French enough to conver&s;e one with another; &s;o that we &s;till remained in the dark, until by mak|ing inquiry in the town, we received the following account, viz. that it is St. Leon's well, who is the titular &s;aint of Bayonne. That this Leon was the fir&s;t go&s;pel mi&s;&s;io|nary &s;ent thither in the pagan times, and that he was greatly per&s;ecuted by them, and la&s;t of all beheaded on a hill above that place where the well now is. That when his head was &s;evered from his body it rolled down the hill and fell upon this place, upon which there immediately i&s;&s;ued out a &s;pring or fountain of water. That it is now the con&s;tant practice of confe&s;|&s;ors to &s;end people to do penance at St. Leon's well; who mu&s;t fix them&s;elves on their knees nearer or farther off according to the nature of their crimes.</P>
<P>When our captain had fully &s;ettled things with the commi&s;&s;ary relative to us, we
<PB N="92" REF="016793_0097_0F9E3176C9DDD548">
proceeded on our way towards the &s;hip as far as the town called St. Jean-de-Luz, where we abode &s;ome time, taking up our quarters at a large inn. One day when at dinner we received a vi&s;it from two friars, one of whom being an Iri&s;hman could &s;peak Engli&s;h well; the other had very little Engli&s;h. We under&s;tood the de&s;ign of their coming was to u&s;e endeavours in their pretended catholick &s;pirit, for our conver&s;ion, by bringing us into the bo&s;om of their church, out of which, they &s;ay, there is no &s;alvation. This Iri&s;h friar &s;oon began to a&s;k que&s;tions, which, for a little while, &s;everal of us an&s;wered; but the di&s;|pute &s;eemed too much in a promi&s;cuous and &s;cattered way, which was not quite &s;ati&s;|factory; neither did it appear altogether fair for &s;o many to engage with one; for the other friar could be of little u&s;e in argument, as he had not the language. I therefore finding my mind pretty much opened and warmly engaged, entered into a clo&s;e di&s;pute with him, which my com|panions ob&s;erving, left it to us. I &s;oon found that his main &s;upport in argument was the authority and infallibility of their church, but more e&s;pecially of the Pope; I therefore told him it was altogether fruit|le&s;s to &s;upport arguments again&s;t me, by an authority I had no faith in; but &s;eeing he and I both allowed the holy &s;criptures to be of divine authority, it would be much
<PB N="93" REF="016793_0098_0F9E3177C59805A8">
better for us to back our arguments by that authority only. It was exceeding diffi|cult to bring him to this, as I believe he clearly fore&s;aw I &s;hould there be too many for him: which fell out accordingly, to that degree (the Lord being near, opening my under&s;tanding) that the poor man was &s;o confounded he knew not what to an&s;wer, nor how to &s;upport an argument thereby; his memory &s;carce &s;erving him to quote one &s;cripture pa&s;&s;age truly. This I &s;ome|times helped him in, repeating the pa&s;|&s;ages he aimed at, to &s;ee what u&s;e he could make of them; but I found him as deficient in applying, as he was in remem|bering the holy &s;criptures; which induced me to think that even their clergy, &s;o cal|led, find tho&s;e &s;acred writings make &s;o little for the &s;upport of their religion, that they do not much regard them. The di&s;|pute continued mo&s;t of the afternoon; in which I mu&s;t &s;ay he carried him&s;elf with good nature and civility, at lea&s;t in ap|pearance. He would &s;ometimes expre&s;s his wonder at my memory; &s;aying, he thought I could repeat all the &s;criptures by heart from the beginning of Gene&s;is to the end of the Revelations. But I knew who graciou&s;ly helped me; for I did not go again&s;t him in my own &s;trength, the Lord being with me in &s;uch a manner that I thought I &s;hould not have been afraid to have engaged with an hundred of their
<PB N="94" REF="016793_0099_0F9E310F78D5A6F0">
mo&s;t crafty prie&s;ts; and therefore I did, and do offer the thank&s;giving and prai&s;e to him alone who is eternally worthy! Towards the conclu&s;ion he a&s;ked me what I thought of their euchari&s;t. I felt (as I thought) a &s;nare in his que&s;tion, where|upon I a&s;ked him whether he intended to en&s;nare me by that que&s;tion; which he did not offer to deny. I was, however, en|abled to an&s;wer him in &s;uch a manner as that he could take no advantage thereof, to bring me into trouble. I often cried unto the Lord to pre&s;erve us in maintaining our te&s;timony, agreeably to what he knew was right in his &s;ight; and at the &s;ame time to be exceeding watchful over our own &s;pirits, le&s;t they &s;hould be too much heated and rai&s;ed in a fal&s;e zeal, with indignation again&s;t the dete&s;table idolatry and abominations of tho&s;e dark countries, that we might not thereby imprudently put our&s;elves into their power; not doubting if the Lord required any &s;ervice of us among&s;t them, he would &s;upport us therein, for he hath all power in heaven and earth. The friars took their leave of us in the evening, &s;ignifying they would vi&s;it us again; but they never did, nor I hardly believe they intended it.</P>
<P>From this place we went into that part of Spain where we fir&s;t landed, and &s;taid there and at Seba&s;tian &s;everal weeks for the cartel &s;hip's &s;ailing. The Spaniards are much more di&s;agreeable to live among&s;t than the

French. The men appeared to us in a general way, poor, proud, and exceeding lazy; filled with high conceits of them|&s;elves, both in a civil and religious &s;en&s;e. They &s;auntered about, walking with their cloaks over their &s;houlders, looking upon us with contempt, as we neither could bow to their pride nor to their religion; nor could we look upon them in a favourable light, when we ob&s;erved what &s;laves they made of their wives and of the women in general, who are employed in all or mo&s;t of the drudgery, even in rowing their boats. I have &s;een near the two la&s;t mentioned places in their ferries, and other bu&s;ine&s;s on the water, to &s;peak within compa&s;s, more than a hundred women thus employed; and &s;carcely a man is &s;een to touch an oar, unle&s;s he goes a fi&s;hing; and then his wife, or &s;ome woman, mu&s;t bring his cloak or &s;word to the water-&s;ide again&s;t he comes on &s;hore, and carry the fi&s;h home on her head, while he walks in &s;tate to the town. This one of the friends who were with me a&s;&s;ured me he &s;aw. I am far from envying our Engli&s;h women their happine&s;s; I think &s;uch indulgent u&s;age is due to the tenderne&s;s of their &s;ex every where; yet I think that were they to &s;ee even what I have &s;een, as above hinted, they would be very thankful to the Author of their being for ca&s;ting their lots in England, or the En|gli&s;h dominions. And indeed, con&s;idering

&s;ome difficulties the &s;ex labours under, which the men are exempt from, &s;uch as child-bearing, nur&s;ing, &amp;c. which render them very un&s;uitable for &s;uch laborious em|ployment, it di&s;covers great cruelty in the men to impo&s;e it upon them.</P>
<P>The darkne&s;s of popery &s;eems greater here than in France; although it may be &s;een and felt there beyond all expre&s;&s;ions. Oh the pain and di&s;tre&s;s of &s;oul I was almo&s;t continually under by the muddy rivers of Babylon in tho&s;e lands of darkne&s;s! the harp being indeed, as it were, hung upon the willows. No &s;weet melody nor &s;ong of Zion could be echoed forth (the Lord know|eth) under the power of the king of the bottomle&s;s-pit, who rules in the my&s;tery of iniquity.

<P>I took notice of Port-Pa&s;&s;age that a per|&s;on went about the &s;treet every evening tinkling a hand-bell, as if he had &s;ome|thing to &s;ell, yet I could not &s;ee any thing he had, which made me a&s;k the rea&s;on of it: I had told, that it was to remind peo|ple of the &s;ouls in purgatory, that they might pray for them. The maid of the hou&s;e where we boarded brought a crucifix, de&s;iring us to ki&s;s it; which &s;ome of the Engli&s;h then pre&s;ent did, to plea&s;e her; but upon my refu&s;al, and withal giving her a gentle rebuke for offering me &s;uch an affront, &s;he alarmed the hou&s;e with com|plaints what a bad Chri&s;tian I was for refu&s;ing to embrace that piece of bra&s;s. Having &s;oon after to pa&s;s through an en|try, I found two men, I &s;uppo&s;e lying in wait for me. One of them came &s;lily be|hind my back, laying fa&s;t hold of both my arms, in order to confine me, whil&s;t the other brought the image to my face; intending, no doubt, to force me into that which they could not bring me voluntarily into. I &s;oon perceived what they were about, and pre&s;ently freed my&s;elf from their (to me) very odious de&s;ign; &s;hewing them, by a &s;tern countenance, and &s;ome &s;harp ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="98" REF="016793_0103_0F9E3113CF0B68F0">
that I was much di&s;plea&s;ed with their uncivil treatment.</P>
<P>I cannot fully account for the cau&s;e, but whil&s;t in Spain, I felt at times, or at lea&s;t I thought &s;o, &s;omething like &s;nares laid to do us mi&s;chief. However that was, the Lord graciously pre&s;erved us, and gave abi|lity to maintain our te&s;timony, as far as he was plea&s;ed to require of us in tho&s;e coun|tries; which was chiefly in feeling the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing weight of death and darkne&s;s that covers the holy &s;eed &s;own in the hearts of mankind, and which is pre&s;&s;ed down by their &s;uper&s;tition, idolatry, and wickedne&s;s
<Q>as a cart is pre&s;&s;ed that is full of &s;heaves.</Q>
It as &s;urely groans for deliverance as I&s;rael did under Egyptian bondage. In &s;ympathy therewith (as I take it) my &s;oul was mo&s;t|ly in deep anxiety; being, as it were, dumb with &s;ilence, and clo&s;ed up in pain|ful death and darkne&s;s; ready at times to &s;ay, Surely I am in the &s;ame &s;pirit with them. But the material difference was this; it was their element, wherein they lievd plea|&s;antly and delighted to breathe; whereas I could neither live nor breathe therein; &s;o far from it that I often looked upon my|&s;elf in a manner quite dead. But let ever|la&s;ting prai&s;e a&s;cend to the God of the living, world without end! He was plea|&s;ed to bring me through this horrible death and darkne&s;s, to enjoy the glorious day of his &s;alvation again, and to be one of tho&s;e,

though unworthy, who have "the lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world" for their light and leader. Then I &s;aw that even in that day of uncommon trials both with|in and without, my life was &s;ure (though not di&s;cerned by me,) being hid with Chri&s;t in God.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time after my arrival in Eng|land before the thick darkne&s;s before-mentioned quite wore off my mind; yet I was favoured, at times, with the &s;hining of the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, as it were break|ing through a thick cloud, to my un&s;peak|able joy and comfort, and I believe in the work of the go&s;pel, to the great &s;atis|faction of many others, to whom I was, through deep &s;uffering, in &s;ome degree qualified to &s;peak, even as deep calleth unto deep.</P>
<P>We arrived in England, and came to an anchor in Torbay, the 26th of the 1&s;t month, 1748, after a pa&s;&s;age of five days. The &s;hip was bound for Plymouth, but the &s;ailors who had been pri&s;oners in France, being in fear of another confinement by being pre&s;&s;ed on board of the men of war, took the command of her from the captain, by &s;omething, in appearance at lea&s;t, like force. He told them he had a &s;afe pro|tection from the government, whereby they would be &s;ecured from what they feared by going to Plymouth. But they did not regard that, neither was he, as we thought,
<PB N="100" REF="016793_0105_0F9E311548069890">
aver&s;e to going into Torbay, as he had the &s;ailors to lay it on; for we had rea&s;on to apprehend he did not keep us waiting in Spain &s;o long for nothing; &s;o that the Bay might &s;uit his purpo&s;e better al&s;o. It being the 1&s;t day of the week, in the evening, when we came to an anchor, Thomas Gaw|throp and I had a great mind to go on &s;hore, that we might endeavour to find a meet|ing of friends. Next day &s;ome of the com|pany &s;ignifying their intention of going about midnight, that being the time when I &s;uppo&s;e the tide would &s;erve be&s;t; we therefore reque&s;ted they would call us, which they did. The &s;hip lay a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance from the town of Brick&s;ham, where we intended to land. We had been in the boat but a little while, when a great &s;torm of wind and rain beat furiou&s;ly again&s;t us, &s;o that the men at the oars found it hard to keep the boat up again&s;t it. We encouraged them all in our power to work for their own lives and ours, let|ting them know, if they would bring us &s;afe to land, they &s;hould be well rewarded for their pains. The danger of being dri|ven back to &s;ea was very apparent, and I believe much feared by all in the boat. The poor men exerted their utmo&s;t en|deavour, which, through the good provi|dence of God, proved &s;ucce&s;sful in bring|ing us &s;afe to land. This I looked upon as a merciful pre&s;ervation, having &s;eldom,
<PB N="101" REF="016793_0106_0F9E311607AB9B98">
if ever, in the cour&s;e of my life, appre|hended greater danger. We were exceed|ingly wet with the rain, but having good fires made for us, and other nece&s;&s;ary ac|commodations, did not &s;uffer much there|by. By enquiry, we found there was a meeting of our friends held near a place called Newton-Bu&s;hel, about ten miles off, to which we went, being truly thankful for the great favour of a &s;afe arrival in Eng|land, and the opportunity of &s;itting down in a meeting of friends again; though we did hold meetings among&s;t our&s;elves in our captivity, on fir&s;t-days, when it ap|peared practicable. This meeting was but &s;mall, and the life of religion &s;eemed to me at a low ebb. I had nothing to deliver unto them by way of te&s;timony. Friends were very loving to us. On &s;econd-day we proceeded towards London, as far as Exeter, where friends entertained us kindly that night. Next day Thomas Gawthrop, I&s;aac Greenleaf, and my&s;elf (leaving our ancient friend Peter Davis with friends there) hired hor&s;es as far as Honiton. There I bought a good &s;erviceable mare, that carried me &s;afe and well through mo&s;t of my travels this journey in England and Wales. We took Bridgport in our way, and lodged with our worthy friend Samuel Bownas, who, with his hou&s;e-keeper, en|tertained us with affectionate kindne&s;s. Now did we begin to enjoy the &s;weetne&s;s
<PB N="102" REF="016793_0107_0F9E3116CB01E6D0">
of brotherly love again. The quarterly-meeting for Dor&s;et&s;hire was held next day at that place, to which we went. It was very &s;mall, and the power of truth which is the crown of all our religious meetings, as I thought was very low therein. We mu&s;t live in that power at other times, if we ex|pect its gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the weighty affairs of the church when met for the ma|nagement thereof; for that which is born of the fle&s;h is but fle&s;h, and cannot enter into the kingdom of God, nor &s;o much as &s;ee it. All is certainly of the fle&s;h that hath its principal delight and &s;atisfaction in &s;ublunary things. So that, although &s;ome may maintain the character of God's peo|ple as to the outward appearance, yet if the love of earthly things hath the chief room in their hearts, the love of the Father is not in them; and therefore &s;uch are not qualified to do God's work. Church-govern|ment, according to the di&s;cipline he in his wi&s;dom hath e&s;tabli&s;hed, requires our under|&s;tandings to be divinely enlightened to move rightly therein; but when any &s;peak and act in the &s;ame natural rea&s;on and under|&s;tanding whereby they manage their outward affairs, which although capable of the one, is altogether unfit for the other; for "the world by wi&s;dom knows not God," con&s;e|quently the&s;e are not likely to under&s;tand his work; but in their pretended endeavours to promote, they mar it, and frequently darken
<PB N="103" REF="016793_0108_0F9E3117C209CA20">
coun&s;el by a multitude of words without right knowledge. In&s;tead of rai&s;ing life in a meeting, they bring death and darkne&s;s over it, to the great pain of the upright-hearted, who are not always ready (like tho&s;e above hinted at) but experimentally know|ing their &s;ufficiency for every good word and work to be of God, they dare not move until it plea&s;e him, by moving upon their hearts, to open their under&s;tandings and to be a &s;pirit of judgment unto them: in this only, there is binding and loo&s;ing, remitting and retaining, with divine ap|probation; which is livingly known and &s;ealed upon the under&s;tanding of the faith|ful, by the holy &s;pirit of promi&s;e. Our way was quite &s;hut up as to mini&s;try or other publick &s;ervice in that meeting. After which we pur&s;ued our journey for London. But I found con&s;tant riding very painful, not only becau&s;e I had not rode much for a con&s;iderable time, but having, accord|ing to the cu&s;tom of America, been u&s;ed to an ea&s;y pacer. My mare now being a trotter, was hard to bear until I was more accu&s;tomed thereunto, which then proved very agreeable. Our friend John Hunt and his wife met us on 7th day at Staines, and being in a coach, prevailed on me, as I was weary with riding, to go with them there|into, and took me to their hou&s;e, where I was kindly entertained, not only that time of my &s;tay in the city, but al&s;o at divers
<PB N="104" REF="016793_0109_0F9E311A87B95738">
other times during my travels in this na|tion. I continued about two weeks in the city, vi&s;iting meetings as they fell in cour&s;e, being mo&s;tly low and pretty much di&s;cou|raged in my mind with a deep &s;en&s;e of mine own weakne&s;s, the greatne&s;s of the work which was before me, and the mourn|ful &s;tate of the church, as it appeared to me, in London. I had but little openne&s;s as to mini&s;try, yet endeavoured to wade along as patiently as I could; it appearing to be my principal bu&s;ine&s;s then to &s;uf|fer with the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;eed, mourning with a &s;en&s;ible remnant, who I could perceive had &s;ackcloth underneath, for the preva|lence of worldly wi&s;dom and grandeur in that great city; the little low meek thing, which by the power of God was exalted among&s;t us in the early time of our being a people, was in too general a way over|looked and di&s;regarded; and man's will and wi&s;dom taking its place, was grown very high, a&s;&s;umed the government in a large degree, where the wi&s;dom of God for|merly bore rule. But this did not pro&s;per; in&s;tead thereof, greater wa&s;te and de&s;olation prevailed. The breathing panting babes after heavenly &s;ub&s;tance were greatly di&s;|couraged, being ready to &s;ay, All is gone! The glory is departed from I&s;rael! What can be done now? But I &s;aw they were to be rai&s;ed in the Lord's time, as an army to fight his battles again&s;t the uncircumci&s;ed

in heart and ears; and that the victory over that &s;pirit was to be obtained through &s;ufferings. Thus I have given a &s;hort hint of the afflicting view I had of the &s;tate of our &s;ociety in the city of London; which place I &s;hall leave for the pre&s;ent; as I &s;hall, in the cour&s;e of this journal, have occa&s;ion, divers times, to make &s;ome far|ther ob&s;ervations thereon, which may tend to explain the above.</P>
<P>I had an ancient mother in Radnor&s;hire, South Wales, whom I had not &s;een for about twenty-two years. I therefore pur|po&s;ed taking meetings in my way thither, and al&s;o in my return to London yearly-meeting. I &s;et out in order to be at Reading quarterly-meeting the 16th of the 2d month, which I attended to good &s;atisfaction. After this meeting I took the following in my way, viz. Henley, Warborough, Witney, Glouce&s;ter, and Ro&s;s. The Lord being my gracious helper, either to do or &s;uffer, in which I endeavoured to be faithful, according to the di&s;covery I received of the divine will. The 26th I got to my mother's hou&s;e, having &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger a little before, le&s;t a &s;udden &s;ur|pri&s;e, although ari&s;ing from much joy, might prove too great a &s;hock for my dear ancient mother to bear without &s;ome in|conveniency. I &s;uppo&s;e our meeting might &s;omewhat re&s;emble that of Jacob and his &s;on Jo&s;eph's. It doubtle&s;s afforded much
<PB N="106" REF="016793_0111_0F9E311C944C4DE8">
comfort to my worthy mother, &s;he being a valuable religious woman, not only to &s;ee me again, but al&s;o that I was come upon a &s;ervice &s;he &s;o greatly loved and valued. My honoured father had then been dead about three years. I had a brother and &s;i&s;ter then living with my mother, and another &s;i&s;ter married, who lived not far from her. I &s;taid thereabouts &s;omewhat more than two weeks; in which time I had divers very large, and &s;ome very open precious meetings; many of other &s;ocieties flocking to them, who &s;eemed much reach|ed by the te&s;timony of truth. But alas! I found things very low there, as to friends, which was cau&s;e of &s;orrow to my mind. Wrong things creeping in, and very few if any, who had judgment and courage enough to deal plainly with di&s;orderly walkers. I was at their monthly meet|ing, and endeavoured to &s;tir them up to a more diligent and zealous exerci&s;e of whole|&s;ome di&s;cipline; but they appeared weak. On 2d day, the 16th of the 3d month, I took leave of my dear mother, brother, and &s;i&s;ters, and &s;et out in order to be at the yearly-meeting in London, Edward Jones bearing me company. I took the follow|ing meetings in my way, viz. Ammelly, Leomin&s;ter, a quarterly held at Broom&s;grove, Worce&s;ter, Eve&s;ham, Ship&s;ton; on fir&s;t-day had two meetings, at Lonycompton in the morning and Chippingnorton in the after|noon;
<PB N="107" REF="016793_0112_0F9E311CD2AEA760">
then to High Wickham, Che&s;ham, and Uxbridge. I had divers open &s;atisfac|tory meetings, and &s;ome very trying and afflicting. The Lord was plea&s;ed to be my help and &s;upport, to whom be humble thank&s;givings for his gracious conde&s;cen|&s;ion to the low e&s;tate of his poor &s;ervants.</P>
<P>I got to London on the 7th day of the week, and the day following attended Grace-church-&s;treet and Devon&s;hire-Hou&s;e meet|ings; but I had very little openne&s;s there|in. My &s;pirit was very low and greatly depre&s;&s;ed, &s;o that I &s;eemed to my&s;elf near fainting under the weight of my burden, which was very great. On 2d day the yearly-meeting began. The fir&s;t was a meeting of mini&s;ters and elders in the morn|ing. Many brethren were met from divers parts of the nation. Among&s;t whom, I looked upon my&s;elf as a mere child, hav|ing much fear and rea&s;oning in my mind le&s;t I &s;hould di&s;honour the great ma&s;ter's cau&s;e, and di&s;cover my great weakne&s;s (as the &s;ame appeared in my own view) to tho&s;e pillars in the church and experien|ced &s;ervants in the Lord's work. But he in great mercy conde&s;cended to my very low e&s;tate, and regarded my humble breathings, giving me the word of life to preach with demon&s;tration that day, which much opened my way in the minds of friends, and was of con&s;iderable advantage to me in my fu|ture &s;ervice; for very much depends on our
<PB N="108" REF="016793_0113_0F9E311D92561F50">
having good place in the hearts of the faith|ful, and that cannot well be until they know us. Chri&s;tian prudence teacheth not to lay hands &s;uddenly on any; therefore &s;uch mu&s;t &s;ee and feel the &s;pirits one of another, in &s;ome degree, before they can unite. Was there not great care and caution in this re|&s;pect, gro&s;s hypocri&s;y, by putting on the out|ward appearance, might be encouraged, which would be a very grievous wound to God's cau&s;e? Many friends after this meet|ing &s;hewed affectionate regard to me; but none more than that &s;ub&s;tantial mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel Samuel Bownas. It had a pro|per effect upon my mind, to &s;trengthen it, and rai&s;e humble acknowledgements to the Lord for his mercy herein. It being my fervent prayer, that whatever I might go through on account of the unfaithful, my &s;ervice and labours might be acceptable to the &s;aints, and that I might be favoured with a &s;en&s;e of the unity and help of their &s;pirits accompanying me therein. I at|tended the yearly-meeting con&s;tantly, both the meetings for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline as they fell in cour&s;e. The power and virtue of truth was near, to the &s;trengthen|ing and comforting our &s;pirits in a good degree: but I have known a much fuller enjoyment and over&s;hadowing thereof, even when all the hills and mountains have been melted as it were, before him who is glorious in holine&s;s, and fearful in prai&s;e,
<PB N="109" REF="016793_0114_0F9E311E4DAE4608">
working wonders for the help and pre&s;er|vation of his people. O then we could ex|perimentally &s;ay, the Lord of awful maje&s;ty pre&s;ideth among&s;t us, being a &s;pirit of judgment to them that &s;it in judgment, and all we &s;tand in need of; even as a place of broad rivers and &s;treams, where nothing of man's invention could obtain any place! The&s;e were times of rejoicing in the pre|&s;ence of the Lord, and drinking freely of the wine and milk, without money and without price. O how hath my &s;oul &s;aid, it is good to be here! Having a de&s;ire, with Peter, to tabernacle there; much dreading to de&s;cend into this vale of tears again, where I mu&s;t &s;truggle with my many in|firmities, which I did not then much feel: but I do not in&s;tance this with de&s;ign to ju&s;tify tho&s;e anxious fears and taking thought for the time to come; but rather as a mark of my great weakne&s;s and want of growth in the mo&s;t precious faith, which is the &s;aints victory, whereby, as we grow therein, &s;trength and patience is received, to endure hardne&s;s as good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; not viewing with much anxious fear the&s;e light afflictions, which are but for a moment; &s;eeing, in due time, if we are properly exerci&s;ed thereby, they will work for us a far more exceeding and eter|nal weight of glory.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth-day of the next week after the yearly-meeting, I &s;et out in order to
<PB N="110" REF="016793_0115_0F9E311F30334390">
be at the three ea&s;tern yearly-meetings, being accompanied by my friends John Hunt and his wife, and Chri&s;topher Wil&s;on who was to be my companion. We lodged that night at Brentwood; next morning early we pa&s;&s;ed on to Chelmsford, (the weather being extremely hot,) and breakfa&s;ted at my dear friend Frances Wyatt's, who after|wards, through the kind providence of God, became my truly affectionate wife. Divers friends went forward towards Col|che&s;ter, but my companion and I &s;taid at Chelmsford meetings on fir&s;t-day. The weather continuing very hot, I think then equal in heat to our weather in America, there aro&s;e a &s;torm of thunder and rain in the time of the meeting: one clap of thun|der, whil&s;t I was upon my feet, &s;o terrified friends as to take away their attention for the pre&s;ent, and I expected to have been obliged to &s;it down; but waiting a &s;hort time, friends recovered, and I went on. A boy was killed thereby, as he was playing near Springfield &s;teeple-hou&s;e, about a mile from Chelmsford. We went after meeting to Kelvedon, and next morning were ac|companied by &s;everal friends towards Col|che&s;ter; but I was &s;o extremely ill of a fever, that I was obliged to alight at Lex|ton, about a mile from the &s;aid place. We mounted our hor&s;es again after I had re|covered a little; but before we had pro|ceeded on the way above half a mile, there

came on &s;uch terrible thunder, as is &s;eldom known in this part of the world. The lightning appeared to glide in &s;treams of fire on the &s;urface of the earth a con&s;idera|ble way, and there &s;eemed, as I thought, a &s;trong &s;mell of &s;ulphur. The thunder frighted my mare to &s;uch a degree, that I being poorly, could &s;carcely &s;it her; but through mercy I received no hurt. I con|tinued ill at Colche&s;ter, &s;o that I did not attend many of the meetings. The yearly-meeting ended there on fourth-day. On the &s;ixth-day following, I was &s;o recovered as to ride in a chai&s;e to Maningtree, and had a meeting there the &s;ame day. On &s;eventh-day we went through Ip&s;wich to Wood|bridge, in order to attend the yearly and quarterly meetings there for the county of Suffolk. We were at their meeting on fir&s;t-day; on &s;econd-day was held their meeting for di&s;cipline, wherein the power and virtue of truth &s;eemed to me low and depre&s;&s;ed; and, although I was fully per|&s;uaded there were divers living, concerned members therein, who had the cau&s;e of truth at heart, yet they appeared al&s;o de|pre&s;&s;ed. The chief rea&s;on whereof I then ap|prehended and have more clearly &s;een &s;ince, was giving too much place to a few bu&s;y forward members, in whom man's will and wi&s;dom was too much exalted, who a&s;&s;umed the rule and government of that meeting; which they were too much indulged in
<PB N="112" REF="016793_0117_0F9E31229BFBA688">
by the cowardice of tho&s;e who&s;e proper bu&s;ine&s;s it was to work for God; that by his ble&s;&s;ing and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they might exalt the weight and authority of truth over &s;uch &s;pirits. For the dominion and ma|je&s;ty of truth in a meeting &s;oon foils and overcomes them, as it is abode in by the heirs thereof; but if they are &s;lack and negligent in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their right, u&s;ur|pers will often take it from them, in this &s;en&s;e. So that &s;uch who are called to work for God in his church, by holding back more than is meet, not only bring poverty and leanne&s;s upon their own &s;ouls thereby, but al&s;o open a door for the &s;pirit of anti|chri&s;t to enter in. I have often &s;een, that when the wi&s;e woman neglects to build the hou&s;e, the fooli&s;h woman, by pretending to build, hath pulled it down with her own hands: this hath been no &s;mall cau&s;e of the wa&s;te and de&s;olation in &s;ome places. I have had much labour with that bu&s;y active forward &s;pirit &s;ince, both in meet|ings and in private plain-dealing, as al&s;o in &s;tirring up and encouraging the right minded to &s;tand their ground; which I hope hath not been altogether without &s;ome good effect. I could not well be ea&s;y to proceed without making the above remarks, as a caution to &s;uch into who&s;e hands this may come, &s;ince it is no &s;mall thing to be guilty of negligence in the work of God, nor to engage therein without a proper qua|lification.

Meetings for wor&s;hip were held on third and fourth days, wherein we were favoured with a good degree of that hea|venly virtue, in which there is renewal of &s;trength and comfortable fellow&s;hip one with another. From thence we proceeded towards Norwich, taking Brandi&s;ton and Lay&s;ton meetings in our way; where true religion appeared to be mournfully low. At Norwich we were favoured with con|&s;iderable openne&s;s and &s;atisfaction in their meetings on fir&s;t-day. The quarterly and yearly meetings for the county of Norfolk were held on &s;econd, third, and fourth days. Divine goodne&s;s was felt a&s;&s;i&s;ting in clo&s;e exerci&s;e and labour, for the help and recovery of a declined people; and heavenly fellow&s;hip &s;weetly enjoyed with tho&s;e who preferred the pro&s;perity of the city of God to their chiefe&s;t joy. On fifth day we had a meeting at Wymondham, wherein we were opened in go&s;pel &s;ervice, to our com|fort and relief in a good degree. Next day we had a meeting at Ta&s;borough, which was a very painful trying time; my duty therein was to &s;et an example of &s;ilence. Here my agreeable companion and I parted. He had been with me ever &s;ince I left London. I was now alone, as to any con|&s;tant companion, and on the fir&s;t-day fol|lowing attended Norwich meeting to pretty good &s;atisfaction; and had the following meetings appointed in my way to Lynn
<PB N="114" REF="016793_0119_0F9E31249E630998">
viz. Lammas, North Wal&s;am, Holt, and Wells; in mo&s;t of which I had clo&s;e laborious &s;ervice: being led, as was often my lot, to &s;tir up and awaken (if po&s;|&s;ible) carele&s;s lukewarm profe&s;&s;ors. Our friend Edmund Peckover accompanied me to Lynn, where we had two meetings on fir&s;t day; they proved very painful and laborious: I had very little openne&s;s as to mini&s;try. From thence we went to Wi&s;|beach, which was a &s;mall meeting, and things appeared very low. The next meet|ing we had was at Gedney, things being al&s;o very low. From thence we went to Spald|ing, and had a heavy laborious meeting: here my friend Edmund Peckover left me and returned home. The &s;ame day was a con&s;iderable eclip&s;e of the &s;un. The next meeting I had was at Broughton, which was very painful and afflicting. The great lo&s;s &s;ome in that part of Lincoln&s;hire (through which I pa&s;&s;ed) have &s;u&s;tained, by for&s;aking the fountain of living water and the commonwealth of our I&s;rael, that they might embrace this pre&s;ent world, Demas-like, was &s;orrowfully felt: although &s;ome of them might retain the outward form, yet having lo&s;t the dew of their youth, they were become dry and formal: by who&s;e means, and the undue liberties indulged in too many of the youth, a thick darkne&s;s was rai&s;ed that might be felt; which did, in a &s;orrowful degree, tend to eclip&s;e the
<PB N="115" REF="016793_0120_0F9E31250B0DDD50">
beauty of our Sion. I travelled from thence through Newark, and a con&s;iderable way by the plea&s;ant river Trent, to Nottingham. Being fir&s;t-day, I was at the meetings there both fore and afternoon. Truth greatly favoured in opening doctrine and coun&s;el in the morning; the afternoon not quite &s;o open, but in a good degree to &s;atisfaction. From thence to Oxon meeting, which was &s;mall yet open. From thence to Man&s;|field, and had a painful trying meeting there. The next was at Che&s;terfield, where the meeting was but &s;mall, yet truth livingly favoured, opening coun&s;el for our help and encouragement in the way of well doing. Notice being previou&s;ly given, I had a large meeting at Matlock on fir&s;t-day. There were a few friends, and many others at this meeting, which proved heavy and laborious for &s;ome time; yet divine goodne&s;s afforded ability to work through, and the holy power of God was in a good degree exalted; prai&s;es to his name for ever! The next meeting I had was at Han&s;worthwood-Hou&s;e on the borders of York&s;hire. There were but few friends, and of tho&s;e few, mo&s;t of them &s;eemed to depend too much upon the labour of the mini&s;ters, as is &s;orrowfully the ca&s;e in too many other places. I had nothing to admini&s;ter unto them but an example of &s;ilence, that ap|pearing be&s;t adapted to their &s;tates; for unle&s;s the great benefit thereof is experien|ced,
<PB N="116" REF="016793_0121_0F9E3125C9930CC0">
there can be no real advancement in true religion. I went from thence to Shef|field, which was a large meeting, and the doctrine of truth was largely and livingly opened therein; I believe to general &s;atis|faction, and to the comfort of the upright-hearted. From thence I went to Highflats, and was at their meeting on fir&s;t-day, which was very large; being compo&s;ed of plain country friends. The Lord was plea|&s;ed to favour us with a precious oppor|tunity together, in the comfortable enjoy|ment of his love &s;hed abroad; under which holy influence, the doctrine of truth was largely opened; the glorious powerful name of the Lord was magnified, and his hum|ble, dependant children were encouraged to &s;erve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind. The next meeting I had was at Brighou&s;e, which was to pretty good &s;atisfaction; truth owning and comforting our &s;pirits therein. Next day I had a very painful afflicting meeting at Halifax, hav|ing rea&s;on to fear but few of the members were rightly acquainted with the quickening virtue of true religion in them&s;elves: when this is the &s;orrowful ca&s;e, it makes heavy work for painful travellers. My la|bour among&s;t them was in a clo&s;e rou&s;ing way, but it did not appear to have much impre&s;&s;ion. From thence to Gilder&s;ome, where I had a pretty open comfortable meeting; and next day one at Leeds to
<PB N="117" REF="016793_0122_0F9E3126961A0908">
&s;atisfaction. This being a large meeting. I &s;taid over fir&s;t-day, and am pur&s;uaded there was a &s;en&s;ible weighty body of friends belonging thereunto; yet there &s;eemed to me a much larger, as to num|ber, who contented them&s;elves in the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of truth, and in hearing the report of others concerning the heavenly coun|try. The indifference of the&s;e, together with their eagerne&s;s after words, appeared to me a cau&s;e of painful anxiety of &s;pirit in that meeting, which I had to &s;uffer under both morning and afternoon. Here my friends John Hunt and his wife from London met me, with intent to accom|pany me to &s;ome meetings in that county, of which I was glad, being alone, often low and much di&s;couraged in mind, in a deep feeling of mine own weakne&s;s; as al&s;o having to wade from place to place, in a painful &s;en&s;e of a greatly declined people whom I was concerned to labour among&s;t; &s;o that, had not divine goodne&s;s at times made me &s;en&s;ible his everla&s;ting arm was underneath, to &s;upport my afflicted &s;oul in various probations, I had certainly faint|ed. But, ble&s;&s;ed be his holy name forever, he was often graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to open a way for me to hold on, when I could &s;ee none, leading me by the hand like a tender merciful father, one &s;tep after another; and giving me more place in the love and regard of his people than I looked for, or

could, as I thought, rea&s;onably expect. I was many times greatly aba&s;ed in mine own &s;ight; ready to &s;ay, to what good purpo&s;e do I vi&s;it the churches? for I &s;eem to move in an untrodden path, as under the weight of the hills and mountains of exalted un|fruitfulne&s;s; and often, as it were, groping in the chambers of death, with &s;uch con|&s;tant afflicting views, that I was ready to &s;ay with the prophet,
<Q>I am a man of un|clean lips, and I dwell among&s;t a people of unclean lips;</Q>
but the live coal from the holy altar, &s;oon removes all that tincture or &s;eeming defilement, which doth not proceed from our own &s;ins and mi&s;carriages, but from tho&s;e of others. Thou deep wader for the good of &s;ouls, this is wrote prin|cipally for thy &s;ake, that thou may&s;t &s;ee others have gone the &s;ame way before thee, and be encouraged &s;o as not to &s;ink under thy burden. I found in the Lord's time (as thou wilt, if thou patiently holds on thy way) that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope. The Lord gave me thereby clearly to &s;ee, I mu&s;t thus feel the wounds, brui&s;es, and putrifying &s;ores of the &s;ons and daugh|ters of Sion, or I could not &s;peak to their &s;tates and conditions feelingly and effec|tually for their help and recovery. Our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t was touched with a feeling of our infirmities. He bore the weight and painful &s;en&s;e of the &s;ins
<PB N="119" REF="016793_0124_0F9E31281FD55290">
of the whole world, ta&s;ting death for every man; whereby he reached forth a merci|ful hand of help and &s;alvation for the re|covery of all, &s;ufficient for all who be|lieve in him and obey him; and his faith|ful me&s;&s;engers mu&s;t know, in degree, a drinking of the &s;ame cup, and being bap|tized with the &s;ame bapti&s;m he was bap|tized with, not only on their own accounts, but al&s;o on the account of others. He &s;till &s;uffers by his &s;pirit, as under the weight and oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;in and iniquity, in the hearts of the children of men; &s;o that all tho&s;e who are one in &s;pirit with him, mu&s;t in mea&s;ure feel his &s;ufferings, and &s;ympathize with him therein; travel|ling in pain, that Chri&s;t may be formed in the hearts of mankind, ruling in his king|dom on earth, as he rules in heaven. But the&s;e things are too my&s;terious for the wi&s;e and prudent of this world to under|&s;tand, being only revealed to tho&s;e who are indeed born of God.</P>
<P>We &s;taid at Leeds until fifth-day, there being a burial, attended by a large number of friends and others. Truth opened our way in the mini&s;try to good &s;atisfaction. Next day we had a &s;mall meeting at Knare&s;|borough, where we found things very low. From thence we went to Thir&s;k, and on fir&s;t-day had a precious open meeting there, in which the te&s;timony of truth was greatly exalted, and the upright-hearted &s;weetly
<PB N="120" REF="016793_0125_0F9E3128C7ED9638">
comforted. The prai&s;e of all belongs to the giver of every good and perfect gift. Next day we went to vi&s;it our ancient honourable friend John Richard&s;on, at his hou&s;e near Hutton in the Hole. He had &s;carcely &s;ight enough to di&s;tingui&s;h us one from the other. We were received and entertained by him with true love and bro|therly affection. He was much at liberty in his &s;pirit, and very free in di&s;cour&s;e about religious things, in which his life and great delight appeared to be. He &s;hewed us (in manu&s;cript) a journal of his life and travels in the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel, &s;ince publi&s;hed, wherein are many very u&s;eful ob&s;ervations and remarkable occur|rences, which I hope will be of great &s;er|vice in the world. On third-day we had a meeting at Hutton, wherein we were fa|voured with &s;ome degree of openne&s;s; yet truth did not rai&s;e to any con&s;iderable de|gree of dominion: but all is be&s;t as the Lord is plea&s;ed to order, for from him alone proceed the i&s;&s;ues of life. On fourth-day morning we took leave of our &s;aid worthy friend in much affection, and had a &s;mall meeting at Bil&s;dale: things were low as to the life of religion in that meeting; after which I parted with my friends John Hunt and his wife. John Scot of Leeds continued with me, who was an hone&s;t labourer for the ari&s;ing of life in meetings, and I thought of con&s;i|derable
<PB N="121" REF="016793_0126_0F9E312BA7E568D0">
help to me. The next meeting we had was at North Allerton; which was ra|ther low and heavy to wade through. We went from thence to Darlington in the county of Durham. I had clo&s;e painful labour there; earthly-mindedne&s;s in pro|fe&s;&s;ors is often the cau&s;e of &s;uch hard work, as it ob&s;tructs the current of life, both in them&s;elves and al&s;o frequently in our religious meetings, like the Phili&s;tines &s;topping up the wells which the true &s;eed hath opened in the hearts of believers; &s;o that many times, in&s;tead of their having to &s;ing, Spring up, O well, and we will &s;ing unto thee! there is mourning and painful labour in &s;ympathy therewith, to have them opened again, that the flock of Chri&s;t's fold may all be watered with the refre&s;hing &s;treams of that river which flows from the pre&s;ence of God. The next meeting I went to was Raby, being on a fir&s;t-day; it was a large heavenly meeting, truth having great dominion, and friends were &s;weetly comforted together. At Bi&s;hop Auckland, the Lord favoured with matter and utter|ance to a con&s;iderable degree of ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction. From thence I went to the city of Durham, and had a hard painful meeting in &s;ilence; al&s;o at Newca&s;tle we had a clo&s;e, trying, laborious meeting; occa&s;ioned, as I apprehended, by undue liberties in thinking and acting, which had rai&s;ed darkne&s;s to be felt in that meet|ing.
<PB N="122" REF="016793_0127_0F9E312C88E1ED00">
We had an open comfortable meeting the next day at Shields. We went to Sunderland, and attended their meetings on fir&s;t-day: that in the morning was very open and &s;atisfactory, the te&s;timony of truth going forth freely to the &s;everal &s;tates of tho&s;e pre&s;ent, who were much affected therewith. In the afternoon it was a heavy afflicting meeting; but little felt of that which crowned the meeting in the morn|ing. We often find afternoon meetings are the mo&s;t heavy and painful, occa&s;ioned, no doubt (in part at lea&s;t) by an&s;wering the cravings of nature to the full; whereas they &s;hould be denied a full gratification, as little &s;u&s;tenance would, for that &s;hort &s;pace of time, an&s;wer much better, and be no injury to the con&s;titution. If any think this hint, by way of caution, impertinent, there is rea&s;on to doubt, that they are yet too much &s;trangers to the nature of true wor|&s;hip and the many impediments in the way of its due performance; what I have above-mentioned is none of the lea&s;t. I was quite &s;hut up as to mini&s;try in the after|noon. Here I met my valuable friends Jonathan and Margaret Raine of Trawden in Lanca&s;hire, being the fir&s;t time I &s;aw them; concerning whom, more hereafter. On &s;econd-day we had another meeting in the city of Durham, wherein the Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to exalt his glorious and powerful name over all di&s;orderly and cor|rupt
<PB N="123" REF="016793_0128_0F9E312DF6D69AD0">
libertine &s;pirits; there being &s;ome &s;uch in the meeting, which was evident to me, from the main &s;cope of the te&s;timony I had to deliver among&s;t them. It was with remarkable authority and &s;harpne&s;s again&s;t &s;uch, who having departed from the divine light, wherewith all mankind are enlight|ened, choo&s;ing rather to be in darkne&s;s, were &s;o lo&s;t in a maze of error, as even to call in que&s;tion the truths of the Chri&s;|tian religion. I was afterwards informed that there were &s;ome &s;uch in that meeting who had imbibed the dark and wicked principle of dei&s;m, or free-thinking, &s;o cal|led; but I had no outward information concerning the &s;tate of any there before the meeting, which I always carefully &s;hunned. The next meeting I had was at Stockton, to pretty good &s;atisfaction, as truth opened my way to di&s;charge the &s;ervice required; yet the meeting was &s;mall, and things ap|peared low, as to the life of religion. I went from thence to Yarum in York&s;hire; had a meeting there, and at Yatten, and Moor&s;ham, to a good degree of &s;atisfaction. The next meeting I had was at Ca&s;tleton. The two la&s;t named were on the Moors, among&s;t a very plain people, who appeared to be in a low &s;tation of life, but I found the &s;avour and virtue of truth among&s;t them, e&s;pecially at the latter; to which that &s;ub|&s;tantial mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel Luke Cock, did in his life-time belong: the remem|brance
<PB N="124" REF="016793_0129_0F9E312E0DFDE0F0">
of whom, although I never per&s;on|nally knew him, was very fre&s;h and living|ly before me in that meeting, as if his &s;pirit had been pre&s;ent; I could, as I thought, perceive the good effects of that worthy man's Chri&s;tian labours among&s;t tho&s;e peo|ple; and a precious meeting the Lord favoured us with together: to whom, for the multitude of his mercies be&s;towed upon us, poor unworthy helple&s;s creatures, be humble thank&s;giving and prai&s;e, now and for evermore. Whitby was the next meet|ing I attended, being on fir&s;t-day, where I had very clo&s;e laborious work. An earth|ly lofty &s;pirit had taken too much place in &s;ome of the profe&s;&s;ors; the tendency where|of is, by darkening the under&s;tanding, and blinding the judgment, to account various weighty branches of our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony &s;mall trifling things. Here the fle&s;h, that warreth again&s;t the &s;pirit, having the a&s;|cendency, its language is quite oppo&s;ite thereunto. The fle&s;h &s;aith, there is little in dre&s;s; religion doth not con&s;i&s;t in apparel; there is little in language; there is little in paying tythes &amp;c. to the prie&s;ts; there is little in carrying guns in our &s;hips, to de|fend our&s;elves in ca&s;e we are attacked by an enemy. To which, I think, it may be &s;afely added, there is little or nothing in people, who plead as above hinted, pretend|ing to be of our &s;ociety; for if they can ea&s;ily let fall the before-mentioned branches
<PB N="125" REF="016793_0130_0F9E312ED0E35570">
of our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony, I am fully per|&s;uaded, they will maintain the others no longer than they apprehend it will &s;uit with their temporal intere&s;t. I have often wondered why &s;uch continue to profe&s;s with us at all. They are not really of us who are not concerned to maintain tho&s;e principles and te&s;timonies the Lord hath given us to bear. I was, through mercy, enabled to di&s;charge the &s;ervice required of me, and went from thence to Scarborough, where the Lord, in gracious conde&s;cen&s;ion, was plea&s;ed to open doctrine and coun&s;el for their help; who appeared to me mo&s;tly low and weak, as to a real growth in true religion. From thence I went to Picker|ing, where the Lord gave us a very precious opportunity together, in the comfortable enjoyment of his power and refre&s;hing pre&s;ence; to the exaltation and renown of his great name, who is worthy for ever. Next day I had a meeting at Malton, being a clo&s;e &s;earching time; truth &s;eemed at a low ebb there. The next meeting at Cran&s;ick was very &s;mall, but the Lord was plea&s;ed to own and comfort us toge|ther, affording coun&s;el for their help and encouragement. I went from thence to Bridlington, and was at their meeting on fir&s;t-day; it was &s;mall, and things very low among&s;t them, as to the life of religion. Oh how greatly is that, and many other meetings declined, both as to number and
<PB N="126" REF="016793_0131_0F9E312F891F01B8">
a lively experience of true religion: &s;ome friends informed me, as I remember, that they knew the time, when fourteen or fif|teen mini&s;tering friends belonged to that meeting; and now perhaps, not a much greater number of members of all &s;orts, belong to it. Once there was a wonderful time of gathering into the vineyard of Chri&s;t; but &s;ince, with &s;orrow and lamen|tation it may be &s;aid, there has been a lo&s;ing, &s;cattering, and dwindling away in many places; the principal occa&s;ion whereof &s;eems to have been, an inordinate love for tran&s;itory enjoyments, lawful in them&s;elves and places, but not to have the chief po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind. When that becomes the &s;orrowful &s;tate of any, they cannot &s;avour the things that be of God, but the things which be of men; and are of con&s;e|quence deprived of that all-&s;ufficient help, &s;o to live and walk, as to an&s;wer the wit|ne&s;s of God in others; to train up their chil|dren in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; and to maintain the te&s;timonies of truth with a convincing &s;trength and efficacy. So that although the form is retained in a con&s;iderable degree by &s;uch, and they may al&s;o be fortified with arguments, to main|tain the con&s;i&s;tency of our profe&s;&s;ion with the primitive plan laid down in holy writ, yet, wanting the &s;alt of the kingdom in them&s;elves, all their preten&s;ions without it will prove nothing; yea, wor&s;e than no|thing;

&s;eeing, by how much more they have had the opportunity of knowing more than others, by &s;o much their condemnation will be greater. Next day we had a &s;mall meeting at Horn&s;ey, and from thence went to Ou&s;twick, and had a large meeting, wherein truth favoured in opening doctrine largely, and to a con&s;iderable degree of &s;atisfaction. The next meeting we had was at Hull, which was indeed a very pain|ful exerci&s;ing time of &s;ilence, in a mournful &s;en&s;e of great declen&s;ion. We find it re|corded in the holy &s;criptures, that we mu&s;t enter the kingdom of heaven through many tribulations. It is indeed a very wonderful mercy, that &s;uch unworthy creatures as we are &s;hould be &s;o highly favoured, as to be admitted thereinto on any terms. I have con&s;idered, that our afflictions in this day, both in the manner and cau&s;e, differ much from the trials of our worthy predece&s;&s;ors. Their bodies were frequently impri&s;oned, and gro&s;sly abu&s;ed by people of different religious per&s;ua&s;ions; but our &s;pirits, when engaged in the work of the go&s;pel, are often impri&s;oned, depre&s;&s;ed, and greatly afflicted, by means of the great unfaithfulne&s;s of many under the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion with our|&s;elves; being at times, on account of &s;uch, &s;o clo&s;ed up in a painful &s;en&s;e of death and darkne&s;s, as to be &s;omewhat like the pro|phet of old, quite &s;hut up and dumb with &s;ilence. This may be occa&s;ioned by &s;uch,

who are &s;o far alienated from the &s;en&s;ible reaches of that mea&s;ure of grace in their own minds, as not to be opened thereby to receive the word preached to advantage; (for the word goeth not forth in vain; but will accompli&s;h that for which it is &s;ent;) and it may al&s;o be nece&s;&s;ary, on account of tho&s;e who have often been comfortably re|fre&s;hed by &s;itting under a living mini&s;try, yet neglecting their own duty in a &s;piritual labour for heavenly bread, look too much for food from the labour of others: which unju&s;tifiable dependance and expec|tation, is often di&s;appointed and mortified. The main de&s;ign of go&s;pel mini&s;try, is to turn the children of men to the grace of God in them&s;elves, which will teach them to work out their own &s;alvation, and dili|gently to &s;eek the Lord for them&s;elves, in whom, their &s;trength being renewed, their &s;pirits would unite, and greatly help and relieve the mini&s;ters in their go&s;pel-labours. From Hull I went to North Cave, where I had an open comfortable meeting. Thence to Howden, where the meeting was &s;mall and things very low; it was held in &s;ilence. I went next to Selby, and attended their meetings on fir&s;t-day. I had &s;ome &s;trength and openne&s;s for &s;ervice in the morning; in the afternoon I had to &s;it in &s;ilence; I could find but very little of the life of religion there. Next day I had an open comfortable meeting at Rawcliff; thence at Pontefract, where
<PB N="129" REF="016793_0134_0F9E3134398E7388">
things were low and painful. The next meet|ing was a &s;mall one at Wakefield, wherein I was quite clo&s;ed up in &s;ilence; the &s;tate of the meeting, as I apprehended, requiring it. I went from thence to Leeds, and next day to the hou&s;e of my e&s;teemed friend William Hird, intending for Brad|ford monthly meeting, which was held on &s;ixth-day, wherein I had thorough &s;ervice, and the ble&s;&s;ed truth had great dominion, to the joy and comfort of many hearts. I returned to Leeds, and attended their meet|ings on fir&s;t-day. They were low and rather painful; my &s;ervice therein was in a clo&s;e &s;earching way; but tho&s;e who are at ea&s;e in Zion like &s;mooth things be&s;t, and are almo&s;t ready to &s;ay now, as &s;ome did formerly to the &s;eers, &s;ee not, and to the prophets, prophe&s;y unto us &s;mooth things. I went from Leeds to the quarterly-meet|ing at York, wherein I had con&s;iderable openne&s;s in &s;ervice; yet my &s;pirit was in|wardly and &s;ecretly pained mo&s;t of the time; the cau&s;e whereof, as I apprehended, was the numbne&s;s and earthly-mindedne&s;s of many members of that very large a&s;&s;em|bly; in which there were, notwith&s;tand|ing, a wi&s;e lively &s;ub&s;tantial body of friends; which, by account, hath continued in a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion from the early times of our &s;ociety. When this meeting was over, I &s;et out, in company with &s;everal friends in their way home, in order to vi&s;it &s;ome meetings

in the Dales, on my way to Kendal quar|terly-meeting; John Scott being al&s;o with me. The fir&s;t meeting we had was at Bane-bridge in Wen&s;ley Dale, which was large, being on a fir&s;t-day. It was a very clo&s;e trying laborious meeting. I had very little to &s;ay by way of mini&s;try, but &s;uffered deep|ly in &s;pirit, under a &s;orrowful &s;en&s;e of car|nality prevailing. Next day I had a very comfortable reviving meeting among&s;t a few plain friends in Gri&s;dale. After which I went home with that plain faithful mini&s;|ter of the go&s;pel Alice Thi&s;tlethwaite, who had borne me company from York, to her hou&s;e in Dent Dale, where we had a meet|ing next day, which I hope was in a good degree &s;erviceable, although things were but low. After this we went to the hou&s;e of that worthy elder and mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel James Wil&s;on, near Brigflats, where, next day, the Lord was plea&s;ed to favour us with a powerful glorious meet|ing; &s;o that we could thankfully witne&s;s truth was over all. Such thorough open meetings, but &s;eldom fall to our lot in this declined &s;tate of things. Yet the Lord is all-&s;ufficient for the help and &s;upport of his faithful &s;ervants, in all times and di&s;|pen&s;ations of his providence to mankind; &s;o that we not only can &s;ay, &s;ufficient to the day is the evil thereof; but al&s;o, &s;uf|ficient to the day is the &s;trength and wi&s;|dom afforded for our a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the

Lord's work. Next day I went to Ken|dal, being accompanied by the before|mentioned worthy friend, who entertained me on the road with divers very plea&s;ing accounts concerning the &s;preading of truth in tho&s;e parts, and the wonderful convince|ments thereabouts, by that memorable &s;er|vant of the Lord George Fox, which the &s;aid friend had heard related by eye-wit|ne&s;&s;es, who were them&s;elves convinced at that time; this made the journey exceed|ing plea&s;ant to me, nothing di&s;agreeable therein, but its being too &s;oon over, as that put an end to this delightful conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>There appeared to me a valuable body of friends in and about Kendal yet left, al|though divers in that town had been remo|ved by death but a little time before; the lo&s;s of whom was much lamented by the &s;urvivors, as they had been u&s;eful mem|bers in their day. It al&s;o appeared that good order was well maintained, and that excellent di&s;cipline e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t us in the wi&s;dom of truth, &s;eemed to be as duly put in practice, as in mo&s;t places I have ob&s;erved among&s;t friends; yet my way was much clo&s;ed up in &s;uffering, du|ring the quarterly-meeting: I &s;taid their meetings on fir&s;t-day, and was largely open|ed in the morning, truth having great do|minion; but in the afternoon was &s;hut up in &s;ilence. On third-day, being Winder|mere general meeting, I went to it; truth

greatly over&s;hadowed that large a&s;&s;embly, and the te&s;timony thereof was much exalted, to the edification and &s;weet refre&s;hment of the upright in heart, as well as deeply affecting the minds of many, I hope to their la&s;ting advantage, who had taken more liberty than truth allows of. Next day I had a &s;mall meeting at Grayrig, where things were low. At Pre&s;ton the Lord was plea&s;ed to favour us with an open comfortable meeting, and truth's te&s;timony was exalted. After which I went to Kendal, and had a very comfortable meeting among&s;t friends there. From thence I went to Swarthmoor, and was at their meeting on a fir&s;t-day, in a meeting-hou&s;e built near the hall, by George Fox; I could not di&s;cover much lively &s;en&s;e of true religion there, it being a time of painful &s;uffering &s;ilence. From thence to the Hight meeting, which was to pretty good &s;atisfaction; and thence to Hawk&s;head; the meeting there was low and afflicting. My principal &s;ervice was to give an example of &s;ilence, which frequently fell to my lot; the Lord favouring with re&s;ignation to his divine will. Next day I had a &s;mall open &s;atisfactory meeting at Ke&s;wick; and went to I&s;el meeting; but had nothing to deliver by way of te&s;timony, being wholly &s;hut up. From thence to Pard&s;haw, which, I think, is the large&s;t country meeting in England, and friends there generally made a plain becoming ap|pearance,

much re&s;embling many meetings in Penn&s;ylvania, both for largene&s;s and other|wi&s;e; the view whereof gave me &s;ingular plea&s;ure, and abundantly the more, as the great ma&s;ter of our a&s;&s;emblies was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to honour and comfort us with his living pre&s;ence, in which there is fulne&s;s of joy: matter and utterance was given by him to a di&s;charge of duty, in which there was peace. I had an open &s;atisfactory meeting in the evening, at my friend and old com|panion Chri&s;topher Wil&s;on's. Next day I had a meeting at Whitehaven. Thence to Broughton, where I had a meeting. I en|deavoured to lean upon the Lord alone, for guidance in my &s;ervice, and by him was frequently much opened, in the &s;tates of meetings and individuals pre&s;ent. The next meeting was at Cockermouth, which was to a good degree of &s;atisfaction. Thence to Allonby, where truth favoured with a good degree of openne&s;s and peace. From thence I went to Holme, a meeting remarkable for having been, I &s;uppo&s;e, more than &s;ixty years interrupted, and grievou&s;ly di&s;turbed by a wicked unruly company of ranters. It began in &s;ome of the Pear&s;ons, and when they were removed, others &s;ucceeded in the &s;ame &s;pirit. Some of them were at the meeting when I was there. A woman of the party &s;poke &s;everal times in &s;uch ran|cour, that I do not remember ever to have taken notice of a voice &s;o much tinctured

with a dark diabolical &s;pirit; but friends, in the ble&s;&s;ed enjoyment of the powerful truth, were quite over it and them, and I believe, had therein been in a good degree pre&s;erved; as that meeting appeared to me the livelie&s;t of any thereabouts, having, as I remember, five or &s;ix public friends belonging thereunto. The next meeting I had was a &s;mall one at Bolton; truth fa|voured with a comfortable degree of open|ne&s;s therein. Thence I went to Wigton, and attended both their meetings on fir&s;t-day; it was an exceeding painful exerci&s;ing time. My mouth was, as it were, clo&s;ed up in mournful &s;ilence, yet not without a pretty clear view and &s;en&s;e of the &s;orrow|ful &s;tates of tho&s;e among&s;t them who had been the principal cau&s;e of the death and mi&s;ery which I felt; I &s;aw what they were doing in the dark, as it were, through the hole in the wall. O! what a great &s;nare bright genius, and exten&s;ive natural abilities are to &s;ome, when they are deluded by Satan to tru&s;t in them, and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly to imagine, they are &s;ufficient to an&s;wer every purpo&s;e for guidance and help not only in temporal but &s;piritual things, without &s;uper|natural and divine aid immediately commu|nicated. I have met with no &s;tate more at enmity, nor in greater oppo&s;ition to the truth; nor from who&s;e &s;pirits more pain and di&s;tre&s;s is to be met with, than from the&s;e worldly wi&s;e and &s;elf-&s;ufficient people, who, no doubt,
<PB N="135" REF="016793_0140_0F9E313C0F101828">
would deride this ob&s;ervation, or any thing el&s;e that a&s;&s;erts an inward &s;en&s;e of things. They are very much out of the way of being reached unto and helped; therefore they are in great danger of being left alone, that they may wonder and peri&s;h. I &s;in|cerely wi&s;h, that the tender-hearted, both youth and others, may be pre&s;erved from the infection of that poi&s;on of a&s;ps which is under their tongues. Next day I had a poor &s;mall meeting at Kirkbright, where my bu&s;ine&s;s was to example them with &s;ilence. From thence to Moor-hou&s;e, where I had &s;ome openne&s;s and &s;atisfaction, though things were but low as to religion in that meeting. The next meeting was in the city of Carli&s;le; my way was clo&s;ed up in painful &s;ilence. I had a &s;mall open meet|ing next day at Scotby; then went to a meeting at Sowport, where there were but few friends, and things very low among&s;t them, as to the life and &s;en&s;ible under|&s;tanding of religion; but there came in many of the neighbours, towards whom I found great openne&s;s to declare the truth, and it was a good meeting. I went next to Kirklington, or the border meeting, being on a fir&s;t-day. Friends having without my knowledge, given notice to their neigh|bours, and to divers people of account in the world; it is likely they expected great things from one come &s;o far to vi&s;it them; and &s;ome perhaps hoped to get credit by

that day's work; but we &s;ee &s;ometimes, when man appoints, the Lord di&s;appoints; which in the i&s;&s;ue, &s;eems to have been the ca&s;e here; as I &s;at the meeting, (which was very large) throughout in &s;ilence, to the great mortification of many pre&s;ent, &s;ome of whom, one might have expected from their appearance and preten&s;ions, to have better under&s;tood the nature of &s;piritual wor&s;hip, than to have been &s;o anxious after words or outward declarations; it proved, I think, as painful and exerci&s;ing a meet|ing as ever I knew, to which the expec|tations of friends and others did not a little contribute. At the conclu&s;ion, I was fully &s;atisfied I had di&s;charged the &s;ervice requir|ed of me that day, in an example of &s;ilence, in which I had peace. I could perceive great unea&s;ine&s;s in many under our name, at the &s;ilence of the meeting. It evidently di&s;covers a mournful degeneracy, &s;eeing &s;ilent wor&s;hip is &s;o directly con&s;i&s;tent with our Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion of the inward teachings of the grace of God that brings &s;alvation, which hath appeared to all men, and teaches all tho&s;e who diligently hearken thereunto, that no time is more &s;uitable than when a&s;&s;embled together, unitedly to wait for this ble&s;&s;ed teaching, and thereby, a renewal of our &s;trength. How ab&s;urd then is it, for tho&s;e who profe&s;s this teaching and acce&s;s to the fountain of all good, to depart there|from and gaze at the clouds, or depend on

the conduits and water-&s;pouts, as if it was in their power to fill them&s;elves, and &s;o to &s;upply all their wants? for although they have at times, by the Lord of all, been u&s;ed as a means for our help and edification, yet &s;uch means or helps are not &s;o e&s;&s;en|tially nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;piritual wor&s;hip pro|fe&s;&s;ed by us as a people, but that it may be as effectually, and con&s;equently as ac|ceptably performed without them, in an awful &s;olemn &s;ilence: than which nothing can be more reaching and convincing to tho&s;e in whom the divine witne&s;s is re|garded, and which may al&s;o tend greatly to rai&s;e that in the minds of &s;uch where it is depre&s;&s;ed. Some have remarked, that tho&s;e who have been convinced in the &s;ilence of our meetings, have generally &s;tood their ground in religion be&s;t. The rea&s;on is plain, becau&s;e they have at the very fir&s;t laid hold of and embraced the very &s;ub&s;tance of religion; whereas, the under&s;tanding may be, in a great mea&s;ure convinced by te&s;ti|mony, and the mind much tendered and affected with lively declarations of the truth; but all this goes off &s;ooner, and will leave &s;uch minds de&s;titute, unle&s;s they happily come to be fixed under the teachings of the grace of God in them&s;elves, and have to &s;it under their own vine, and under their own fig-tree, where none can make them afraid. None need be a&s;hamed of a &s;olemn awful &s;ilence before God, and in the &s;ight of men;

&s;eeking the Lord, who will be found of all &s;uch, and will, by his &s;ecret invi&s;ible power, vindicate that &s;ort of &s;ilence in the hearts of all who &s;uffer his pure witne&s;s to ari&s;e. All who reject the voice of this holy witne&s;s, may ju&s;tly be di&s;regarded by God's people, &s;o as not to be di&s;couraged by what they &s;ay on that account. But on the other hand, when any thing of this nature is done in the form and by way of imitation only, there being nothing &s;uper|natural to &s;upport and defend the &s;ame, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall under contempt, and like the &s;alt that hath lo&s;t its &s;avour, will be trodden under the feet of men. That &s;cripture pa&s;&s;age is very ob&s;ervable, where &s;ome undertook to ca&s;t out devils in the name of Je&s;us, whom Paul preached. It is plain the evil &s;pirits knew, notwith&s;tanding their pretences, that they wanted power to &s;ubject them; and therefore an&s;wered the&s;e imitators and pretenders,
<Q>Je&s;us I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye? and the man in whom the evil &s;pirit was, leaped upon them, and prevailed again&s;t them, &s;o that they fled out of the hou&s;e naked and wounded.</Q>
I in&s;tance this pa&s;&s;age to &s;hew how inefficacious imita|tion is: they would do well to con&s;ider this, who, upon a &s;erious examination, do not find the Lord with them in their religious performances; for a&s;&s;uredly nothing can &s;tand approved in his &s;ight, nor maintain

a dignity worthy of him, in this &s;tate of probation, but the real product of his own &s;pirit in us; therefore, let all who profe&s;s &s;piritual wor&s;hip, greatly dread being found in &s;en&s;ele&s;s &s;tupid &s;ilence, although it be in the very &s;ame form the people of God have been, and are &s;till led into; knowing, that the be&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent form is alto|gether contemptible without the heavenly power. I felt and perceived divers of them were much offended with me, for abiding in that &s;tation the Lord placed me in that day, which they did not altogether forbear letting me know by words; neither did I let them pa&s;s without &s;ome clo&s;e remarks on their &s;orrowful &s;tate and great blindne&s;s. In about a week after, I received a long letter upon the &s;ubject, from one, &s;etting forth among&s;t other things, how great a my&s;tery it was to him, that a per&s;on in my &s;tation, travelling from one nation to ano|ther, &s;hould di&s;appoint people, friends and others, by &s;uch unaccountable &s;ilence; had not I di&s;covered &s;ufficient cau&s;e to believe this friend was not then what he had been, his letter would have been as great a my&s;tery to me as my &s;ilence in that meeting was to him. When I had peru&s;ed the &s;aid letter, I was mo&s;t ea&s;y to let it pa&s;s as not worth an&s;wering. This was a time of very great anxiety to my mind, and I have made the a|bove remarks thereon, as I felt my mind open|ed thereunto; for no rea&s;on, than as a

caution or warning to all profe&s;&s;ors of the ble&s;&s;ed truth into who&s;e hands this may come, that they may watch and pray con|tinually; le&s;t, by departing from the pure leadings of truth in them&s;elves, they fall into the like ab&s;urdities; manife&s;ting to others, that they are but mere pretenders to &s;piritual wor&s;hip; and al&s;o for encou|ragement to painful travellers in the work of the go&s;pel, who&s;e lot, in the cour&s;e of their &s;ervice, may fall among&s;t &s;uch, to whom they may be as &s;igns and gazing-&s;tocks, becau&s;e their time is not always ready. What makes &s;uch examples more nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ome places, is the bu&s;y for|wardne&s;s of un&s;kilful mini&s;ters among&s;t them&s;elves, who may be too apt to feed the people with a multitude of words; per|haps frequently recommending &s;ilence in words, but not &s;ufficiently by example. I have &s;een it much my place, e&s;pecially at home, to &s;hew friends by my example, the benefit and nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ilence, and, as it were, to lead them into it.

remedy but patience and re&s;ignation to the divine will, without who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I knew it was in vain to attempt any thing by way of mini&s;try. My way of travelling as above hinted, often &s;ilent, was looked upon then by many, as a &s;trange and unu&s;ual thing; but &s;ome others have been led pretty much in the &s;ame track; however, I had mo&s;tly great peace, and inward &s;trength to &s;tand my ground therein, as all will who follow the Lord whither&s;oever he &s;hall be plea&s;ed to lead them.</P>
<P>I had a meeting on third-day at the hou&s;e of Cuthbert Wigham in Northumber|land, which was a &s;weet refre&s;hing time, and tended much to &s;trengthen and revive my drooping &s;pirit. Next day I had a pretty open &s;erviceable meeting at Allondale. From thence to Al&s;tonmoor, where the Lord was plea&s;ed to favour me with a tho|rough rou&s;ing opportunity, and God's everla&s;ting truth was exalted. The next meeting I had was at Penrith, where things appeared to me but low. I went from thence to Coldbeck, and was at their meeting on fir&s;t-day. It was a very hard di&s;tre&s;&s;ing time. There I felt, as I thought, &s;ome of tho&s;e hard dark &s;pirits, which had occa|&s;ioned great anxiety at &s;undry places in that county; who might, as I apprehended, be compared to the bulls of Ba&s;han that com|pa&s;&s;ed David about.

&s;coff at the expre&s;&s;ion of their &s;pirits being felt, but the time will &s;oon overtake them wherein their &s;pirits will feel, though now perhaps in a great mea&s;ure pa&s;t feeling. Next day I had a &s;mall but pretty open meeting at Ma&s;&s;dale. From thence to Terril, where I had a good open &s;atisfactory meeting, truth being exalted and friends comforted. The next meeting was Strick|land, which was but &s;mall yet to good &s;atisfaction. I went from thence to Ken|dal, and attended their meetings on &s;ixth-day, fir&s;t-day, and third-day. Mo&s;t of them were to me trying laborious meet|ings. I was not much opened as to mini|&s;try. Friends in many places had need to be brought from words, to the one eter|nal in&s;peaking word. On fourth-day at Yealand in Lanca&s;hire, I had a clo&s;e &s;earch|ing meeting. The next day I was favoured with an open comfortable time at Wray meeting. From thence I went to Bentham, where truth a&s;&s;i&s;ted to di&s;charge what I had before me, to a good degree of &s;atisfac|tion. From thence to Settle, where on fir&s;t-day we were favoured with a precious open meeting. The te&s;timony of truth went forth freely and affectingly, to the tendering many hearts: Prai&s;es and thank&s;|giving to the Lord for the &s;ame. Next day I had a &s;mall but a very open meeting at Monybent. From thence to Soly meeting, which appeared to me in a very weak, low

After meeting I went to the hou&s;e of my kind friends Jonathan and Margaret Raine; and from thence to Mar&s;den Height meeting, in which the Lord's power was livingly felt, whereby the te&s;timony of truth was delivered with clearne&s;s and good demon&s;tration. Next day had a meeting at Trawden. On fir&s;t-day I went again to Mar&s;den meeting, which was a thorough good opportunity, and we were &s;weetly comforted together.</P>
<P>Being now pretty much fatigued with con&s;tant travelling and clo&s;e labour, I re&s;ted at Jonathan Raine's about a week, and then went to a large meeting of friends in Lather&s;dale, where I was much favoured, and largely opened to deliver the doctrines of truth, with good demon&s;tration, and to my own peace. The next day I had a com|fortable open meeting at Airton; my friend Jonathan Raine bearing me company. From thence to Skipton, and had a meeting; things were but low. I had that evening a good open opportunity among&s;t our wor|thy friend David Hall's &s;cholars. Thence I went and had a meeting at Fairfield, which was &s;mall, but pretty open and I hope &s;er|viceable. The next meeting was at Ne|ther&s;dale, where I had very laborious &s;earch|ing work; the te&s;timony was clo&s;e and &s;harp again&s;t formal profe&s;&s;ors, yet, through divine favour, I was enabled to get through
<PB N="144" REF="016793_0149_0F9E31451915C4A8">
to very good &s;atisfaction, and the meeting ended comfortably. I went from thence to A&s;quith, where was a &s;mall open meeting. The next meeting was at Rodan, and being on a fir&s;t-day, it was very large: a plain &s;olid body of friends belonged thereunto. We were favoured with an open meeting, the te&s;timony of truth being exalted. Next day I had a very comfortable open meeting at Bradford, and went to Keighley, which was al&s;o an open &s;atisfactory meeting. There I received from my worthy friend David Hall, by the hands of his wife, a truly &s;ub|&s;tantial and encouraging letter: as it con|tains matter of weighty in&s;truction, I wil|lingly give it a place here, not doubting but it will be very agreeable to &s;ome read|ers, and think it cannot hurt any.</P>

<P>IN the &s;weet &s;pirit, and fellow&s;hip of the everla&s;ting and glorious go&s;pel of peace, I hereby kindly &s;alute thee, and thy dear companion and fellow-labourer in the ac|ceptable work thou art now engaged in; not forgetting his worthy con&s;ort Margaret, when thou &s;ee&s;t her.

rugged ocean with thy life in thy hand, as an amba&s;&s;ador in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, to preach glad tidings of good things to the meek; to call upon and rou&s;e the indolent and care|le&s;s; to direct the &s;traying &s;heep unto the fold of re&s;t; to rai&s;e the drooping ones that are now too low, and endeavour to bring down the lofty that are too high, to the true centre, even the mid&s;t of the path of judgment: in &s;hort, to bring unto us the pledges of thy ma&s;ter's love and thine, and to receive ours; who, after he had in his wi&s;dom and coun&s;el, &s;uffered thee to be taken captive for the trial of thy faith, in mercy ran&s;omed thee as an evidence of his power, will never leave thee nor for&s;ake thee. I have unity with thy &s;pirit, gift, and with the manner of the admini&s;tration thereof. I intreat thee, dear brother, keep to thy &s;teady bottom way.

<P>The diver&s;ities of gifts, operations, and admini&s;trations, from the one &s;pirit, are beautiful and &s;erviceable: as the &s;tars in the firmament are not all of one magnitude, have not all one &s;tation nor degree of lu&s;|tre, but are each ornamental and &s;ervice|able in their re&s;pective places and &s;ea&s;ons.

<P>After this meeting, I went home with my companion Jonathan Raine, to Traw|den. From thence I went next day to Todmorden, and had a laborious exerci&s;e|ing meeting there; yet through the ex|tending of heavenly help, I was enabled to di&s;charge the &s;ervice required, to mine own ea&s;e and comfort in a good degree. I had a &s;mall poor meeting at Oldham next day; &s;ilent labour &s;eemed to be my proper bu|&s;ine&s;s therein. On fir&s;t-day, the 25th of 10th month, I went to Cro&s;hawbooth in Ro&s;&s;endale, which was a pretty large meet|ing; but I was in &s;o weak a &s;tate of body, being much &s;pent with travelling and deep clo&s;e labour, having for &s;ome time but a very poor appetite, that my &s;pirits were greatly exhau&s;ted; &s;o that finding my mind engaged in that meeting, I &s;tood up in order to de|liver what &s;eemed to be required, but was
<PB N="148" REF="016793_0153_0F9E31479F56EF18">
obliged &s;oon to &s;it down again, being &s;o very weak and &s;pent I could not rai&s;e my voice, &s;o as to be heard. I then concluded it was time to take &s;ome re&s;t, in order to recover &s;trength as formerly if it was the Lord's will, which I did not then much expect, thinking my&s;elf far gone; nor indeed did I de&s;ire it; for my afflictions, &s;everal ways, about that time were very heavy, which made me weary of this world, and had it been the Lord's will, &s;hould have been glad to have embraced death rather than life; yet I endeavoured to be re&s;igned to the divine will. Great care was taken of me with affectionate kindne&s;s, by my worthy friends Jonathan Raine, his wife, and her &s;i&s;ter Ann who then lived with them; having often the company of that valuable family, the Ec|royds of Edgend: I was brought very near the&s;e two families in that love that think|eth no evil; being by illne&s;s, or rather weakne&s;s, detained there about nine or ten weeks. It was an exceeding wet &s;ea&s;on; being al&s;o the dead of winter, yet I got mo&s;tly out to their meeting, which was near; and went divers times to Mar&s;den-Height meeting, about four miles off; and once to Skipton, and Lotherdale, about eight or ten miles off: in mo&s;t of which meetings the Lord was with me to my great comfort, enlarging my heart in &s;er|vice for him and his people, to my &s;atis|faction
<PB N="149" REF="016793_0154_0F9E3148476DD330">
and encouragement. As &s;oon as I was pretty well recovered and the weather more fit to travel in, I &s;et out for Lan|ca&s;ter; my kind friend Jonathan Raine bearing me company; and attended both their meetings on fir&s;t-day; being painful and laborious. I had nothing given me to deliver by way of public te&s;timony; divers friends there appeared to me then, and more &s;ince, lively and &s;en&s;ible of the work of true religion; yet I apprehend, the expectations of too many were out after words that day, which was to be di&s;appointed. O that all were really turned to the more &s;ure word, that they might never be di&s;appointed! I was next day at their monthly-meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s, which was low, truth not having much dominion therein. I went to Wyer&s;|dale, and had a pretty open meeting; re|turned to Lanca&s;ter, where next day, we were through divine goodne&s;s, favoured with a heavenly baptizing meeting, to our great joy in reverent thankfulne&s;s; friends being &s;weetly united in the precious enjoy|ment of the pure love and goodne&s;s of God; having an additional confirmation, that when the Lord is plea&s;ed to &s;hut, none can open, and when he is plea&s;ed to open, none can &s;hut. As there had been very little openne&s;s at divers meetings there before, and at this the Lord opened places of broad rivers and &s;treams, to the un&s;peak|able plea&s;ure and refre&s;hment of thir&s;ty
<PB N="150" REF="016793_0155_0F9E314B0D4FC6A0">
&s;ouls; in a &s;en&s;e thereof I took my leave of friends, being accompanied by my e&s;teem|ed friends William Backhou&s;e and Jona|than Raine. We had a pretty open com|fortable meeting at the Fylde. Next day had a thorough awakening opportunity at Freckleton, being enabled to divide the word with great plainne&s;s to their &s;tates; wherein I had ea&s;e and peace. We then went to Pre&s;ton, where the number of friends was exceeding &s;mall, and but little to be felt of a &s;piritual travail or lively &s;en&s;e of religion among&s;t tho&s;e few, there hav|ing been a mournful declen&s;ion; yet I found the Lord's merciful loving-kindne&s;s gra|ciou&s;ly extended towards them for their help and recovery. From Pre&s;ton I went to the following meetings, viz. Cappul, A&s;hton, Bicker&s;taff, and Leverpool: in all which, the Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to afford wi&s;dom and &s;trength, to open doc|trine and coun&s;el for the &s;tirring up care|le&s;s lukewarm profe&s;&s;ors, as well as to the encouragement and edification of the &s;incere-hearted, al&s;o to mine own ea&s;e and peace in a good degree. I went from Lever|pool to the hou&s;e of Gilbert Thomp&s;on, and was at Penketh meeting on fir&s;t-day; where my &s;pirit was deeply afflicted, under a &s;en&s;e of too many profe&s;&s;ors &s;itting down at ea&s;e, &s;eeking to be fed with words and outward declarations concerning the things of God. I have found this much the
<PB N="151" REF="016793_0156_0F9E314BF1A26BC0">
ca&s;e at &s;ome places where eminent in|&s;truments have dwelt. Friends have &s;uf|fered their minds to be too much drawn from a diligent &s;piritual labour, to receive the bread and water of life immediately from the fountain thereof; and depended upon the labour of &s;uch in&s;truments who are but as clouds or water-&s;pouts; having no power to fill them&s;elves nor to feed the flock profitably, until furni&s;hed for that purpo&s;e, by the bounty of the inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ury of wi&s;dom and all-&s;ufficiency. Here the fountain is for&s;aken for the &s;tream's &s;ake; the eye being more to the gift than the giver, which is an abu&s;e of the gift, and provokes the Lord to jealou&s;y; giving him ju&s;t cau&s;e to withhold &s;uch in&s;trumen|tal means from people. The rea&s;on of &s;uch a dangerous mi&s;take, to me is obvious, viz. becau&s;e it is found ea&s;ier for fle&s;h to receive by &s;uch a medium;
<Q>Let not God &s;peak unto us, le&s;t we die, &s;aid the people of I&s;rael, but let Mo&s;es [the in&s;trument] &s;peak unto us.</Q>
There is a life that ought to die on the cro&s;s, which is ea&s;ier &s;aved alive under te&s;timonies be they ever &s;o &s;ub|&s;tantial and excellent, than under the im|mediate teachings of Chri&s;t; who&s;e voice is as a fire again&s;t evil of every kind, and affords no peace after it is di&s;covered, until it be given up for de&s;truction, and to be purged away by the &s;pirit of judgment and burning. This pure voice &s;peaks to us in
<PB N="152" REF="016793_0157_0F9E314D552DB8F0">
&s;uch a manner, as that we can by no means turn it off from our&s;elves by applying it to the &s;tates of others; which may be done under the mo&s;t &s;earching te&s;timonies; there being a partiality to our&s;elves, which, through the deceitfulne&s;s of the heart, we are but too apt to fall into; and al&s;o to flat|ter our&s;elves, by &s;uppo&s;ing the plea&s;ure we take in hearing the doctrines of truth de|livered, ari&s;es from the good in us, when it may be no other than the &s;tate of tho&s;e, to whom the prophet Ezekiel's words and declarations were as a lovely &s;ong, of one that hath a plea&s;ant voice: for they heard his words, it &s;eems, with plea&s;ure, but did them not; their heart going &s;till after their covetou&s;ne&s;s. I have lengthened this re|mark the more, becau&s;e of the very hurt|ful con&s;equences I often have &s;een and felt, by an over-anxiou&s;ne&s;s in people after out|ward declarations; even to the neglect of that great and nece&s;&s;ary work, of drawing near to God with true hearts, in full a&s;|&s;urance of faith; wherein is our only &s;afety and help. May this con&s;ideration deeply engage all minds to return unto him, the great &s;hepherd of I&s;rael, who puts his own &s;heep forth and goeth before them, lead|ing into green pa&s;tures, bringing them up from the wa&s;hing-pool, bearing twins, none being barren among&s;t them. I found it my place to give that meeting an example of &s;ilence. From thence I went to their
<PB N="153" REF="016793_0158_0F9E314D8BDCC228">
monthly-meeting at Hart&s;haw, wherein I &s;at a con&s;iderable time in &s;ilent waiting upon and &s;eeking the Lord, who was plea&s;ed in his own time to open a living &s;pring of mini&s;try, and truth greatly pre|vailed, to the comfort and edification of friends: there being al&s;o divers not of our &s;ociety pre&s;ent during the meeting for wor|&s;hip, among&s;t whom one, who expre&s;&s;ed a &s;en&s;e he had of an awful &s;olemnity to be felt in the meeting before any words were uttered, which to him exceeded words or outward declarations, or to that effect: as a friend told me afterwards. This, doubtle&s;s, would be much more the ca&s;e with many who at times come among&s;t us, were our religious meetings held more in the &s;en|&s;ible feeling of the divine power. From thence I went to Manche&s;ter, and had a meeting there, which was low and afflict|ing. Some who &s;hould have been way-marks and leaders of the flock, not keep|ing their own &s;pirits in due &s;ubjection to the peaceable &s;pirit of truth, had not main|tained the unity thereof, which is the bond of peace: whereby that meeting was hurt and the pernicious effects thereof were pain|fully felt. I &s;taid until their fir&s;t-day meetings were over, where the Lord was plea&s;ed to afford &s;ufficient ability to di&s;|charge the &s;ervice required, to mine own ea&s;e and comfort, in a good degree. I went from thence to Stockport in Che|&s;hire,
<PB N="154" REF="016793_0159_0F9E314E52B5A088">
and had an open comfortable meet|ing, to the reviving of tho&s;e few who la|boured to keep their habitations in the truth, and warning of carele&s;s profe&s;&s;ors. I had next day a &s;mall poor meeting at Mac|clesfield. I went from thence to Morley, where, although the appearance of pro|fe&s;&s;ors was large, yet very little to be felt of the life of religion among&s;t them; but in&s;tead thereof, a &s;en&s;e of death and dark|ne&s;s, occa&s;ioned by wrong things. I had no openne&s;s at that time to admini&s;ter any thing, but an example of &s;ilence. I had a meeting next day at Frandley, where truth favoured with a degree of openne&s;s. I went from thence to Sutton, where things appeared low: I found it my place to &s;it the whole meeting in &s;ilence. The next meeting was at Newton, being on fir&s;t-day, where I was favoured with a pretty thorough opportunity to clear my&s;elf. Then went to We&s;t-Che&s;ter; had a &s;mall meeting there in &s;ilence, and things appeared very low. The next day I had a good &s;atisfac|tory meeting at Namptwich; and went to Middlewich, where I met our worthy friend Jo&s;hua Toft. The meeting was, through divine goodne&s;s extended for our help, to pretty good &s;atisfaction. I went home with the above-mentioned friend, and had a meeting next day at Leek in Stafford&s;hire: I &s;at the whole time in &s;ilence; friends ap|peared to me, in too general a way, at ea&s;e
<PB N="155" REF="016793_0160_0F9E314F0BD36F70">
in an empty form of religion, depending on the labour of others. I went next day in company with Jo&s;hua Toft, to the burial of a friend at Stafford; there were but few of our &s;ociety thereabout, but many others came, &s;ome of whom were very rude and noi&s;y in the meeting. Our way was quite blocked up as to mini&s;try. I returned with Jo&s;hua Toft and went to Leek meeting on fir&s;t-day, wherein I had a thorough rou&s;ing opportunity; truth being exalted, and the great name of God magnified, who alone is worthy for ever. I went from thence in company with my dear friend Jo&s;hua Toft, to the quarterly-meeting for Che&s;hire, to be held at Middlewich: infinite kindne&s;s was greatly manife&s;ted at that meeting, for the benefit of friends in general and the en|couragement of the upright-hearted in par|ticular. Things re&s;pecting truth and friends being in the general, very low in that coun|ty; yet the Lord, in conde&s;cending kind|ne&s;s, extended his love for their revival and recovery. Here I found my mind engaged to vi&s;it Morley meeting again, the afore&s;aid friend joining me therein; and &s;ending no|tice by &s;ome friends returning from the quar|terly-meeting; we had a very large meeting, compo&s;ed of friends and others. I had tho|rough &s;ervice therein; yet near the conclu&s;ion, not finding my mind clear of tho&s;e under our profe&s;&s;ion, others were de&s;ired to withdraw, which they immediately did. Our labour
<PB N="156" REF="016793_0161_0F9E314FCA362E78">
was very clo&s;e and &s;earching among&s;t tho&s;e under the profe&s;&s;ion of truth, things being much out of order; undue liberties having crept in. The Lord favoured me with wi&s;|dom and &s;trength, &s;o to di&s;charge my&s;elf of the &s;ervice required, as to go away with a peaceful ea&s;y mind.</P>
<P>I have now to give an account of an un|expected turn I found in my mind, re&s;pect|ing the cour&s;e I was to &s;teer in my travels. When I left Lanca&s;ter I had no other view than to vi&s;it meetings agreeable to the foregoing account, and to proceed in a pretty direct cour&s;e through the Midland counties towards London. But, very con|trary to my expectation, I found my way quite blocked up and &s;topped as to what is before hinted, and another opened before me, viz. To turn into York&s;hire again, and take meetings in my way to the quarterly-meeting there; from thence to Lanca&s;ter quarterly-meeting; and to the circular yearly-meeting for the northern counties, to be held that year at Kendal; after which, to cro&s;s the &s;ea for Ireland. But O, the clo&s;e exerci&s;e this unlooked-for turn brought upon my mind: not &s;o much out of reluctance to obey the Lord's re|quiring, provided I was favoured with clear certainty thereof, as fears of being mi&s;taken; and great rea&s;onings there were in my weakne&s;s; yet through divine favour,
<PB N="157" REF="016793_0162_0F9E315087549E10">
I was enabled, in a good degree to go over them, and to yield obedience to that which I believed was required. I there|upon acquainted my friend William Back|hou&s;e with the time I purpo&s;ed going for Ireland, as he, when with me in the Fylde country of Lanca&s;hire, had &s;ignified his de|&s;ire of bearing me company therein, when I found it my duty to undertake it; al|though neither he nor I thought then it would be &s;o &s;oon; however, I received his an&s;wer, that he intended to prepare again&s;t the time propo&s;ed, in order to bear me company. We went from this meeting to Lowlighton in Derby&s;hire, where we were favoured with a good open meeting, and &s;o proceeded over the mountains of Der|by&s;hire-Peak, to Sheffield in York&s;hire; where the Lord was plea&s;ed to give us a very gracious confirming meeting; truth and its te&s;timony being greatly exalted. This ble&s;&s;ed opportunity removed all my rea&s;onings and fears before hinted; for which my &s;oul was humbly thankful to the Lord, my alone helper. After this meeting my much e&s;teemed friend Jo&s;hua Toft and I took leave of each other, he returning home. I went with our worthy friend John Ha&s;lam to his hou&s;e at Hand&s;|worth Woodhou&s;e, where the next day I had a very open &s;atisfactory meeting; the Lord affording doctrine and coun&s;el &s;uit|able to the &s;tates of tho&s;e few belonging
<PB N="158" REF="016793_0163_0F9E315357154958">
to that meeting. When at the hou&s;e of my friend before-mentioned, my mind was touched with &s;omething like his bearing me company to York and from thence to Ken|dal yearly-meeting, which I informed him of; but he made very light of it, perhaps thinking my motive was only for the &s;ake of having his company. I advi&s;ed him to take with him &s;uch things as he might think nece&s;&s;ary, in ca&s;e he was to go; and if, when at York, he found no &s;uch con|cern, he might then return home. We &s;et out together for York, taking meet|ings in our way, at Newel-Grange and Bar|ton, which were precious open times; the life and power of truth attending to our great comfort. We travelled on to Leeds, and lodged at our worthy friend Chri&s;tiana Horne's, who in her time had been a &s;uc|courer of many of the Lord's me&s;&s;engers, being a truly open-hearted woman, a mo|ther in our I&s;rael. But &s;he did not continue a great while in mutability after this. Next day we proceeded to York, and attended the quarterly-meeting; but cannot find any memorandum by me of its &s;tate, therefore have but little to &s;ay concerning it. I &s;taid over their fir&s;t-day meetings at York; they were hard and painful; I had nothing by way of te&s;timony, &s;ave a little at one of them. My truly valuable friend John Ha&s;lam acquainted me, that what I had &s;aid to him at his own hou&s;e, of bearing
<PB N="159" REF="016793_0164_0F9E3154415B8CA8">
me company to Lanca&s;ter quarterly-meet|ing and the yearly-meeting at Kendal, had laid &s;uch clo&s;e hold of his mind that he could not find freedom to leave me. He &s;aid I had, by tho&s;e few expre&s;&s;ions, although he did not much regard them at fir&s;t, ca&s;t &s;uch a mantle over him, (or to that effect) that he found he mu&s;t go with me, though not &s;o well provided for the journey as he could de&s;ire. We went from York to our friend William Hird's, and from thence to David Hall's, and &s;o to the monthly-meeting at Settle. In the after|noon the &s;ame day, we were at the burial of a friend there, which was an open &s;ati&s;|factory time, truth over&s;hadowing the meet|ing, and the te&s;timony thereof was exalted to our great comfort. Next day we had a pretty open comfortable meeting at Ben|tham, and went from thence to the hou&s;e of our friend William Backhou&s;e, who I expected to find prepared to go with me into Ireland; but to my no &s;mall &s;urprize, I found he had rea&s;oned it away, under an apprehen&s;ion that his propo&s;al of accompany|ing me proceeded more from his love to me than any real concern at that time. I was fully per&s;uaded his concern was right, as he had acquainted me it had remained on his mind to vi&s;it Ireland again for &s;ome years: I therefore had a great travail in my mind for him, that he might be brought to a right &s;en&s;e and di&s;cerning of the Lord's re|quirings;
<PB N="160" REF="016793_0165_0F9E31544CB167A8">
being fully &s;atisfied he was a man of &s;incerity, who would not wilfully tran&s;|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>I took an opportunity with him next morning, and his concern returning, and he abiding &s;teadily under the weight thereof, afterwards performed the &s;aid journey to his own peace, and was to me an agreeable friend and fellow-labourer. Having appointed to meet me at Whitehaven; we went from his hou&s;e to Lanca&s;ter, and attended their meet|ings on fir&s;t-day. In both which I found it my bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;et an example of &s;ilence. I was taken &s;uddenly that night after all were a bed, with an uncommon &s;welling in my throat, not much unlike a quin&s;ey; I could &s;carcely &s;wallow liquids for &s;ome time, &s;o that it &s;eemed very probable to tho&s;e about me, that it would &s;oon be over with me, as to this world. Concerning which, I was very ea&s;y in my mind. A doctor was quickly &s;ent for; by who&s;e care, under divine favour, I &s;oon recovered, &s;o as to attend the yearly-meeting at Kendal. It was very large, there being a great col|lection of friends from many parts, and large numbers of people of other &s;ocieties. This meeting was divinely favoured, e&s;pecially at the concluding meeting, wherein God's everla&s;ting truth triumphed gloriou&s;ly, and my poor depre&s;&s;ed &s;pirit, that had long waded under the weight of wrong things, was rai&s;ed into comfortable dominion, and
<PB N="161" REF="016793_0166_0F9E3155A3FAB180">
obtained, through the captain of our &s;alva|tion, complete victory over tho&s;e hard un|mortified &s;pirits, undue liberties, and car|nal lifele&s;s profe&s;&s;ors, I had long mourned under a painful &s;en&s;e of, in my northern travels; now I was &s;et over them all, for I &s;en&s;ibly perceived, and livingly felt his eternal power &s;et over all wrong &s;pirits, and clearly &s;aw the Lamb and his followers will obtain the victory: and although it hath been, is, and will be, through great &s;uf|ferings; yet tho&s;e who patiently &s;uffer with Chri&s;t, &s;hall al&s;o reign with him. This meeting crowned all my &s;ervice in tho&s;e parts; after which I found my mind quite at liberty to embark for Ireland. I &s;et out next day for Whitehaven in company with my good friend Chri&s;topher Wil&s;on; a very plea&s;ant journey we had, in that &s;weet innocent freedom which cloathed our &s;pirits, feeling the con&s;olating &s;treams of that river which maketh glad the city of God. Here we, in degree, enjoyed the new heavens and the new earth wherein dwelleth righteou&s;|ne&s;s: the fruit and effect whereof is quiet|ne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance for ever. I was at Pard|&s;haw meeting, being on a fir&s;t-day. It was a precious opportunity; truth was greatly in dominion and its te&s;timony exalted, the &s;incere-hearted being &s;weetly comforted and united one to another. The next day I went to their monthly-meeting, and had good &s;ervice, both in the meeting of wor|&s;hip
<PB N="162" REF="016793_0167_0F9E3155CCEB2CB8">
and that for tran&s;acting the affairs of the church. The weighty &s;ervice of vi&s;it|ing families was before that meeting, and I under&s;tood had been &s;ometime ob&s;tructed by &s;ome of the members, to the concern and unea&s;ine&s;s of others. It was clear to me, when it came to be weightily con&s;ider|ed, that the power and virtue of truth was livingly with the promoters of &s;o good a work, and I did fully believe the Lord would ble&s;s it in their hands. I therefore endeavoured to &s;ift the oppo&s;ite &s;ide as well as I could, to the bottom, and found very little or no weight in what they had to offer again&s;t it. Upon which they were ear|ne&s;tly de&s;ired not to hinder the &s;ervice of others, in that important work that had &s;o often and &s;o evidently been ble&s;&s;ed, al|though they might be unwilling to put their own hands thereto. Truth aro&s;e and came over them, &s;o that friends at that meeting appointed fifteen or &s;ixteen men and women, to go in &s;everal companies on the &s;ervice, as that monthly-meeting is large in its extent. This afforded great relief and &s;atisfaction to the &s;incere travellers for Sion's pro&s;perity. I went from thence accompanied by &s;everal friends, to White|haven, where I met my intended compa|nion William Backhou&s;e; and a &s;hip be|longing to a friend, who&s;e name was James Nichol&s;on, being ready to &s;ail for Dublin, we went on board of her, the 19th
<PB N="163" REF="016793_0168_0F9E315693094A80">
of the 2d month, 1749, in the evening, and were &s;oon under &s;ail. We met with contrary winds, and a very rough unea&s;y pa&s;|&s;age as to our bodies; being five days and as many nights before we landed. What made it much harder for William and me to bear, we had given up the beds prepar|ed for us to two women friends that came on board and were unprovided, they being al&s;o very &s;ea-&s;ick mo&s;t of the time; &s;o we were under a nece&s;&s;ity of lying down on the cabin floor or upon &s;ome of the che&s;ts, in our cloaths, which we did not take off all the while, that I remember. This proved very trying and hard to us, and greatly &s;pent and fatigued we were when we landed at Dublin: where we were re|ceived and entertained with affectionate kindne&s;s by our friend Samuel Judd and family, at who&s;e hou&s;e we lodged while in that city. The half year's meeting began in the morning of the day we landed, it being afternoon when we got on &s;hore.</P>
<P>The next day we attended two meetings for the affairs of the church; and I am fully per&s;uaded, there was a faithful exer|ci&s;ed remnant, painfully labouring for the re&s;toration of ancient beauty and comeline&s;s, and the affairs of the church were tran&s;|acted with very con&s;iderable order and decency; yet my &s;pirit was, as it were, cloathed with deep mourning, and much clo&s;ed up in painful anxiety. The cau&s;e
<PB N="164" REF="016793_0169_0F9E315749C8FD58">
whereof I did not then di&s;tinctly under|&s;tand; but when I had travelled through the nation, vi&s;iting the churches, and &s;or|rowfully viewing the de&s;olations thereof, my &s;ufferings in &s;pirit at the half year's meet|ing were no longer a my&s;tery to me. The next morning was held a general large con|cluding meeting for wor&s;hip and in the afternoon a meeting of mini&s;ters and elders; at both which, e&s;pecially the latter, I had open thorough &s;ervice; as al&s;o in their week-day meeting at Sycomore-alley on &s;ixth-day. We &s;taid at Dublin over fir&s;t-day: at Meath-Street in the morning the Lord was plea&s;ed to furni&s;h largely with matter and utterance, to a good degree of &s;atisfaction. In the afternoon at Sycomore|alley, I found it my duty to be &s;ilent. On &s;econd-day we &s;et out from Dublin, accompanied by James Evans and wife, in order to vi&s;it the following meetings in our way towards Cork, viz. Ballycane, Wick|low, Errats, Wrights, Cooladine, Wex|ford, Lamb&s;ton, Ro&s;s, Waterford, Clon|mel, Kilcomon, Youghall, and &s;o to Cork. We found things very low indeed in mo&s;t of the &s;aid meetings; my labour in them was generally &s;earching, painful, and labo|rious. Truth &s;eldom having that comfort|able dominion (by rea&s;on of the prevalence of wrong things) as was earne&s;tly laboured for, both by us, and al&s;o by a few mourn|ers &s;cattered up and down in tho&s;e parts,
<PB N="165" REF="016793_0170_0F9E315809F78768">
who waited for, and ardently &s;ought the pro&s;perity of Zion. Such can only rejoice when the righteous &s;eed beareth rule. We had &s;everal meetings in the city of Cork, where there is a con&s;iderable body of friends, as to number. But oh! the love of this world and other undue liberties, hath pre|vailed, to the great hurt of the &s;ociety there al&s;o. Our labour was for the mo&s;t part, painful and exerci&s;ing among&s;t them. From thence we went to Kilcomon again; &s;o to Ca&s;hel, Limerick, Jonathan Barns's, and Birr. At &s;everal of which meetings I found it my place to example the people with &s;ilence, which was the ca&s;e at Birr, having (as it was &s;aid) all the people called Methodi&s;ts re&s;iding there, and their preacher at the meeting; than whom, I think no peo|ple are more at a lo&s;s what to do with &s;ilence in wor&s;hip; I am per&s;uaded there have been awakenings of merciful kindne&s;s to them, and they have &s;een the nece&s;&s;ity of the new|birth; but their notions about it have been for the mo&s;t part, in the airy vi&s;ions, and flightine&s;s of their own imaginations; not coming to cea&s;e from man, or from their own willings and runnings. Oh that they were &s;o happy as to be emptied! that God might be all in all, working in them the will and the deed; then would they come really to experience true poverty of &s;pirit, and to abhor forward active &s;elf, who&s;e time is always ready. In this &s;afe, &s;elf-denying
<PB N="166" REF="016793_0171_0F9E3158CC9BEF90">
&s;ituation, they would really feel an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to wait, as with their mouths in the du&s;t before the Lord, until he &s;hall be plea&s;ed to ari&s;e in their hearts; whereby all his and their enemies would be &s;cattered. Then would true wor&s;hip be performed, and they e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the immoveable rock that the gates of hell cannot prevail again&s;t. After Birr, we had meetings at the Moat, Old-Ca&s;tle, Ballyhai&s;e, Coothill, and Ca&s;tle&s;hane; which meetings were mo&s;tly &s;mall and painful; truth favoured with a degree of &s;trength, to labour for their help and recovery; but, alas! the life of religion appeared to be at a very low ebb. The next meetings we had were at Bally|hagen and Charlemont, which were large, yet but little to be felt of the life of reli|gion moving or &s;tirring in them; neither did there appear to be much &s;oundne&s;s among&s;t &s;ome of the foremo&s;t rank; &s;everal of whom having admini&s;tered cau&s;e of &s;tumbling and di&s;couragement to others, it had a bad favour and influence; in&s;tead of gathering, it had tended to &s;catter from the fold of Chri&s;t's flock. I had very clo&s;e &s;earching-work among&s;t them, in order to bring the judgment of truth over &s;uch, as the Lord was plea&s;ed to open my way and to di&s;cover their &s;tates to me, being altoge|ther without any outward information there|of. I under&s;tood afterwards &s;ome of them re&s;ented it, though they &s;aid nothing to
<PB N="167" REF="016793_0172_0F9E3159888A2070">
me about it; but as &s;ome had before, &s;o I under&s;tood one or more of them did &s;oon after, manife&s;t a ba&s;e ungodly foundation. We proceeded from thence to take the meetings round Lough Neigh, viz. Tober|head, Colraine, Ballinacre, Grange, and Antrim; which meetings appeared indeed almo&s;t a de&s;olation with re&s;pect to the &s;en|&s;ible po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of truth, although it was profe&s;&s;ed by &s;ome. A time of deep mourn|ing and di&s;tre&s;s it was to my &s;oul, to view their captivity and lo&s;s, which them&s;elves did not &s;eem to have much &s;en&s;e of. The next meeting was Ballinderry, being very large, but heavy and painful; yet the ble&s;|&s;ed power of truth prevailed in a good de|gree. From thence we went to the follow|ing places and had meetings, viz. Li&s;burn, Hil&s;borough, Lurgan, and Moyallan; where, although we found &s;ome true mourners in and for Zion, yet the bulk of the &s;ociety &s;eemed to love the world and the things that are therein, to that degree, as to have very little ta&s;te or reli&s;h for the things of God. Even &s;ome of tho&s;e, who, by their &s;tations in the church, ought to have been lively examples of &s;elf-denial in this re&s;pect, appeared to be as deeply plunged into this mournful cau&s;e of de&s;olation as any. Alas! what account will they have to give of their &s;teward&s;hip, when the chief &s;hepherd &s;hall appear. From this place we cro&s;&s;ed the country to Edenderry; once remarkable for
<PB N="168" REF="016793_0173_0F9E315C4D6ECC08">
a brave, lively body of friends: there are now a large number of profe&s;&s;ors belonging to it; but, alas! the glory is much depart|ed, and the fountain of living water for&s;a|ken by many. Oh, how are they gone into captivity by the muddy waters of Babylon! We attended their meeting on a fir&s;t-day, but could hear no melody or &s;ong of Zion; all being clo&s;ed up, and our harps hung, as it were, upon the willows. It was a time of deep &s;ilent mourning. About the time of breaking up that meeting, it livingly &s;prung in my mind, that as they had re|jected abundant favours be&s;towed upon them that they might be gathered to God, &s;o the Lord would reject many of them. The next meetings we had, were at Timahoe, Rathagon, Mount Melick, Mountrath, Ballinakill, at James Huche&s;on's, Carlow, Kilconner, and the province meeting at Ca&s;tle Dermot. Pain, di&s;tre&s;s, and clo&s;e labour, either in te&s;timony, or an example of &s;ilence, attended in the la&s;t-mentioned meetings; yet the Lord was a gracious &s;up|port through all. I hope our deep wadings and painful &s;ervice, was not without &s;ome good effects, both to the &s;tirring up the carele&s;s, and comforting the mourners in Zion. I had very clo&s;e &s;ervice at the pro|vince meeting; yet, by divine favour, was carried through to pretty good &s;atisfaction, and I believe it was a &s;erviceable meeting to many. From thence, in our way to Dub|lin,
<PB N="169" REF="016793_0174_0F9E315D2BF714C8">
we had meetings at Athy, Ballytore, and Baltybois, which were very &s;mall, and true religion very low. From thence we went to Dublin, intending &s;hortly to em|bark for England. We attended the meet|ings in the city, both on fir&s;t and other days of the week during our &s;tay, but I had very little openne&s;s therein; being made to the profe&s;&s;ors as a &s;ign and example of &s;ilence from meeting to meeting. Great indeed were my inward di&s;tre&s;&s;es, on account of the mournful declen&s;ion of the church in Ireland: the Lord knoweth, and was my only &s;upport under it. Ble&s;&s;ed be his name for ever! Divers there were among&s;t them|&s;elves, who greatly lamented it. The tra|vail of who&s;e pained &s;ouls, I hope the Lord of &s;abbaths will regard in his own time, &s;o as to turn his hand again upon a greatly declined church, that he may, by the &s;pirit of judgment and burning, purely purge away her dro&s;s, take away her tin and reprobate &s;ilver; that her judges may be re&s;tored as at the fir&s;t, and her coun&s;ellors as at the beginning.</P>
<P>It may by &s;ome be looked upon rather imprudent, to lay open the defection and &s;piritual condition or &s;tate of our &s;ociety, which depends &s;o much upon my own te&s;|timony of an inward &s;en&s;e given me thereof in my travels. In the fir&s;t place, no other per&s;on can do it for me, and I cannot find my mind ea&s;y that it &s;hould be wholly
<PB N="170" REF="016793_0175_0F9E315E59ECF298">
omitted. It hath been &s;o repeatedly, and with &s;uch clear evidence to my under&s;tand|ing confirmed, that I have not the lea&s;t doubt of what I write in that re&s;pect; al|though it be with a con&s;iderable degree of reluctance, yet it &s;eems my way, and I am not ea&s;y to go out of it; intending no other by tho&s;e clo&s;e remarks, than as le&s;&s;ons of in&s;truction, caution, and warning to &s;ucceed|ing generations; if, when I am removed hence, this be looked upon worth printing. So far I may add, that the laying open the mournful declen&s;ion of the &s;ociety, and pointing out &s;ome of the cau&s;es thereof, as my under&s;tanding might be opened there|into, was one of the principal things that engaged me to write a journal: it never entering into my thought, that my tra|vels and little &s;ervices, &s;ingly con&s;idered, were of &s;uch con&s;equence as to merit the re|gard of my friends, &s;o as to be publi&s;hed; but thinking the account of my travels and the ob&s;ervations of the &s;tate of things are nece&s;&s;arily connected together, &s;o that in doing the fir&s;t, I could not well avoid the la&s;t. I have further to add, that I think my&s;elf al&s;o warranted herein, by the exam|ple of God's faithful witne&s;&s;es in ages pa&s;t, with whom it was u&s;ual to lay open the &s;tates of the people, both in an individual manner and in a more collective body, viz. as nations, &s;ocieties, or churches; al&s;o &s;etting forth, for a warning to all &s;ucceed|ing
<PB N="171" REF="016793_0176_0F9E315ECD545698">
generations, tho&s;e particular evils which cau&s;ed the Lord's di&s;plea&s;ure, and would, if not turned from, bring down his judg|ments upon them. We al&s;o find, that even the&s;e warnings and heavy denunciations of judgment, were pre&s;erved in writing, as a te&s;timony for God, and again&s;t them&s;elves, even by tho&s;e again&s;t whom they were really given forth; yea, the particular evils and frailties which, through inadvertency, the Lord's choice &s;ervants fell into, and deeply repented of, are recorded; not only as warnings to all, but al&s;o to excite charity and tenderne&s;s towards tho&s;e who have fal|len into evil, in ca&s;e they repent and for|&s;ake; con&s;idering our&s;elves, that we may al&s;o be tempted, and therefore never dare upbraid tho&s;e, who, through their own im|prudence, have fallen among&s;t thieves and are naked and wounded, provided they re|turn again to the father's hou&s;e. I have ju&s;t further to remark, that I have ob&s;erved a prevailing di&s;po&s;ition in &s;ome of con&s;idera|ble eminence in the &s;ociety, and in a great many others, to cry up mightily for peace and charity, the maintenance of unity, and not to pre&s;s any thing very clo&s;ely, le&s;t the peace of the &s;ociety &s;hould thereby be endangered; although, perhaps, the things urged cannot well be objected to upon any other principle, than ground|le&s;s fears, and a faint-hearted mind not yet quite upright to God, nor wholly redeem|ed
<PB N="172" REF="016793_0177_0F9E315F8BBF2FD8">
from the prai&s;e of men: as there is an unwillingne&s;s to di&s;plea&s;e them, though in maintaining the Lord's cau&s;e:
<Q>for if I yet plea&s;ed men (&s;aid Paul) I &s;hould not be the &s;ervant of Chri&s;t.</Q>
What makes me take notice of this, is, that I have &s;een a great &s;nare in it, wrong things &s;uffered to remain and prevail under it, and the fire of primitive zeal again&s;t undue liberty, too much quenched. We have no &s;uch examples in the prophets, or in Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, of indulgence, and winking at wrong things, and fal&s;e ea&s;e. They, in their concern to te&s;tify again&s;t &s;uch things, had no fear of breaking unity, nor di&s;turbing the quiet and peace of any people, let their rank or &s;tation be what it may. Had this noble &s;pirit of ancient zeal been more generally exerci&s;ed in plain dealing and &s;peaking the truth one to another, the mournful declen|&s;ion &s;o ju&s;tly complained of among&s;t us as a people, would not have &s;o generally prevailed. It is but about a century, &s;ince the Lord, by an out-&s;tretched arm, gathered our &s;ociety, as from the barren mountains and de&s;olate hills of empty profe&s;&s;ion; choo&s;e|ing them for his own peculiar flock and family; as by many evident tokens of his love and mighty protection, doth fully ap|pear: even when the powers of the earth, like the raging waves of the &s;ea, ro&s;e up again&s;t them, with full purpo&s;e to &s;catter and
<PB N="173" REF="016793_0178_0F9E31606441B530">
lay wa&s;te. This remarkable in&s;tance of his regard, mu&s;t, I think, gain the a&s;&s;ent of every con&s;iderate per&s;on, who hath not yet a capacity of under&s;tanding clearly the Lord's gracious dealings with his people, in a more &s;piritual and my&s;terious relation. When I view the multitude of his favours and ble&s;&s;ings to them in this re&s;pect, I am afraid even to attempt the recounting and &s;etting forth &s;o copious and amazing a &s;ub|ject, which can better be admired, and the bountiful author adored for the &s;ame. It may be ju&s;tly queried, what could the Lord have done for us that he hath not done? Notwith&s;tanding which, what indifference, lukewarmne&s;s, and in&s;en&s;ibility as to the life of religion, is now to be found among&s;t numbers under our name; nay, in &s;ome places, this painful lethargy is become al|mo&s;t general; although I hope a few may be excepted, who are much afflicted on that account, being exceedingly burdened with an earthly, carnal &s;pirit. Oh! how doth covetou&s;ne&s;s which is idolatry, and an in|ordinate love of things, lawful in them&s;elves and places, cloak, &s;helter, and hug them|&s;elves, even under a plain appearance in &s;ome; yet plainne&s;s is no more to blame for that, than the name di&s;ciple or apo&s;tle was to blame, becau&s;e Judas once bore that name. I could write much more on this mournful &s;ubject, having &s;uffered &s;o deeply in my travels on account of the grievous
<PB N="174" REF="016793_0179_0F9E31610734CD88">
declen&s;ion; but hope to ea&s;e my mind, by dropping here and there a remark, as I pro|ceed in giving account of my travels.</P>
<P>We embarked at Dublin the eighteenth of the 5th month in the morning, and landed at Peel near Swarthmoor-Hall next day. One thing I am not quite free to omit, as I could not well help looking upon it a providential pre&s;ervation of my life, viz. the &s;ands being very exten&s;ive there|about, and we happening rather too late, as to the time of tide-&s;erving, to be &s;et on &s;hore, could not, by the waters leaving of us, bring the boat up &s;o as to land in time. We were thus &s;et fa&s;t, about half a mile from firm land. We could therefore think of no better way in this difficulty, than accepting the poor &s;ailors a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which they kindly offered us, viz. to carry us to land on their backs, which was no &s;mall undertaking, as we were, e&s;pecially my&s;elf, none of the lighte&s;t; however, I was the fir&s;t, and believe the &s;ailor, who was a &s;trong man, would have carried me to land, had not both of us, in our journey thither, fallen into a large quick-&s;and. The &s;ailor immediately left me (his burden) to &s;hift for my&s;elf, whil&s;t he did the &s;ame; but he had greatly the advantage of me, as he could &s;wim, which I had never learned. However, I was, &s;ome how or other, buoyed up in a wonderful manner, &s;o that I never was plunged over head; to which,
<PB N="175" REF="016793_0180_0F9E316365F13DD8">
perhaps, my great coat buttoned about me, might in &s;ome mea&s;ure contribute. I well remember, that I could feel nothing under my feet but water, or &s;oft mud that could bear up no more than water; my head being all the while above water; I knew which way we tumbled in, and being near the bank, I made &s;ome &s;hift to &s;cramble to it, and to climb up of my&s;elf. I then waded to the &s;hore, being exceeding wet and dirty. We went to a poor cottage, where the accommodations were indeed very mean; but the poor people's kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality was very noble, which we did not let pa&s;s unrewarded. We got that night to my affectionate companion's hou&s;e; hav|ing travelled the before-mentioned journey with great diligence, in much love and harmony one with another, and were not quite three months out of England. The fir&s;t meeting I went to after we landed, was Yeoland, as my companion belonged to it, which was a good open meeting; truth being exalted over wrong things. I went from thence to Lanca&s;ter, where I had a &s;atisfactory meeting; the Lord's power in a good degree having dominion, to our comfort. I went from Lanca&s;ter directly to Warrington, and was at Penketh meet|ing in the forenoon, being fir&s;t-day; where the Lord was plea&s;ed to favour us with a precious opportunity, truth being exalted over all, and the &s;incere travellers Sionward
<PB N="176" REF="016793_0181_0F9E316446F3F3F8">
greatly comforted, in the &s;weet enjoyment of the Lord's pre&s;ence, which was livingly felt among&s;t us. Prai&s;es to his holy name for ever! In the afternoon we had a large meeting at Warrington, where it appeared my duty to &s;it in &s;ilence; the want of which, properly employed, proves a great lo&s;s to our &s;ociety in many places. I went next day, accompanied by my worthy friends Samuel Fothergill and William Dilworth, in order to be at Mar&s;den-Height yearly-meeting, and to vi&s;it my kind friends there|about. I attended Mar&s;den week-day meet|ing on fifth-day, which was &s;atisfactory. On the fir&s;t-day following, the yearly-meeting was held, to which came a large collection of friends from parts adjacent, and a pretty many people of other per&s;ua|&s;ions. The Lord was plea&s;ed to exalt his glorious truth and the te&s;timony thereof, in a free and open manner that day, to the comfort of many hearts. I went from thence to Todmorden, and &s;o to Manche&s;ter, being accompanied by my affectionate friends Jonathan Raine and his wife. At Man|che&s;ter we had an open comfortable meet|ing, truth having dominion; wherein alone the upright-hearted can rejoice, with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory. I went to Oldham meeting on fir&s;t-day; which was in a good degree open, and I hope &s;ervice|able. The next day I travelled to my wor|thy friend Jo&s;hua Toft's near Leek; had
<PB N="177" REF="016793_0182_0F9E316589AAFDA8">
a meeting there, in which I found it my place to &s;it the whole time in &s;ilence. From thence I travelled towards Birming|ham in Warwick&s;hire, having my &s;aid friend with me. We attended both their meetings, being on fir&s;t-day; they were very heavy and laborious, through the pre|valence of lukewarmne&s;s in &s;ome, and un|due liberty in others; &s;o that I had but very little openne&s;s at either of the meet|ings, and was quite &s;hut up in &s;ilence at one of them. The next meetings we had were at Wigan&s;al and Ather&s;tone; but found the life of religion very low in them. The yearly-meetings for the we&s;terly coun|ties being to be held at Coventry, we went thither in order to attend the &s;ame, which began on fir&s;t-day, the &s;ixth of the &s;ixth month, 1749. The meetings were held in a large town-hall; conveniency being made therein by friends for the purpo&s;e; &s;o that one room which was called the hall, would contain by computation, not le&s;s than a thou&s;and people; and another under the &s;ame roof, it was &s;uppo&s;ed would contain above five hundred. We had a pretty large meeting-hou&s;e be&s;ides. The&s;e, I think, once or more, were all filled at one time. There was indeed a great collection of friends from many parts, and very great flockings in of others, among&s;t whom there was con&s;iderable openne&s;s, and their beha|viour in general was becoming. The go&s;|pel
<PB N="178" REF="016793_0183_0F9E31664E520FB8">
was preached with power, clearne&s;s, and good demon&s;tration. I found my&s;elf much excu&s;ed from public &s;ervice, which I accounted a favour; having greatly to rejoice in the exaltation of truth's te&s;timony through well qualified in&s;truments, of whom there were a con&s;iderable number pre&s;ent, whom I greatly preferred, and was glad the public &s;ervice fell chiefly upon them; for I have ever accounted it a concern of great importance, to appear by way of public te&s;timony in tho&s;e large a&s;&s;emblies, and have earne&s;tly prayed they might be conducted in the be&s;t wi&s;dom; which, doubtle&s;s, would always be the ca&s;e, if the &s;pirits of all who undertake the great and awful work of the mini&s;try, were truly &s;ub|jected to the alone &s;ource or fountain there|of: who is, to his humble dependant ones, wi&s;dom and utterance. The meeting ended on third-day, to the comfort of friends, and, as far as appeared, to the general &s;atis|faction of others; who&s;e attention to what was delivered, and behaviour to friends in general, was to their honour, and the repu|tation of the city of Coventry. On fourth-day there was a meeting appointed at my reque&s;t, in Warwick, to which I went; but when I &s;aw the great comings in of people; many of whom by their appearance, &s;eemed to be of the principal inhabitants; I was pretty much intimidated, and fell under di&s;couragement for a time, know|ing
<PB N="179" REF="016793_0184_0F9E316708D68AF0">
my own great weakne&s;s. My great fear was, le&s;t through my means, or that of &s;ome others pre&s;ent, truth might &s;uffer. I cried with earne&s;t concern to the Lord, who &s;eeth in &s;ecret, and he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to hear, and to furni&s;h with might, by his &s;pirit in the inward man; &s;o that the everla&s;ting truth and its te&s;timony, was exalted that day, and the people ap|peared to be pretty much affected there|with.</P>
<P>I have many times &s;een it very profitable to be deeply humbled, and awfully pro&s;|trated before the almighty powerful helper of his people; that &s;o, what we are in the mini&s;try may be by his grace only; hav|ing ob&s;erved, where the creaturely part is not wholly aba&s;ed, but &s;ome &s;ufficiency or trea&s;ure belonging thereunto is yet &s;aved or re&s;erved (it being very clo&s;e work to be &s;tripped of all) there hath been a mixture brought forth; a wearing the linen and woollen garment, and &s;owing the field with two &s;orts of grain; and when any by cu&s;tom, their own unwatchfulne&s;s, or the neglect of others who&s;e care &s;hould have been over them, become, as it were, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in this mixture, I think they &s;el|dom get out of it the right way, by the bad being removed, and the good pre&s;erved. Oh, it is a great thing to &s;tand fully ap|proved in this &s;olemn &s;ervice! to &s;peak as the oracles of God, and to mini&s;ter of the

ability immediately given by him. Ble&s;&s;ed will that &s;ervant be, who when his Lord cometh, is found dividing the word aright, giving the flock and family of Chri&s;t their proper portion of meat, and that in due &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Having a de&s;ire to take &s;ome meetings in my way into Wales, whither I intend|ed in order to vi&s;it my dear ancient mother, I took the following meetings, viz. Hen|ley, Broom&s;grove, and Worce&s;ter. I had clo&s;e laborious &s;ervice in them, as was often my lot where I travelled. I &s;pent about a week at my mother's, having &s;everal large tho|rough &s;erviceable meetings among&s;t friends, my old neighbours, and acquaintance; their hearts being tendered, and &s;ome much affected. But, alas! things are at a low ebb with our &s;ociety in tho&s;e parts, and the conduct of &s;ome rather admini&s;ters cau&s;e of &s;tumbling than convincement to others. I travelled from thence to Bewdly, Stour|bridge, and Dudley; my brother Benjamin bearing me company. I had good open &s;ervice at the &s;aid meetings, and went to Birmingham, where I had a hard trying meeting as before. I went from thence to Hart&s;hill general meeting, being on a fir&s;t-day. It was, through divine favour, an open good meeting. I went the third-day following back to the burial of a friend at Birmingham; and returned to the hou&s;e of my kind friend John Bradford, who bore

me company next day to Hinkley in Lei|ce&s;ter&s;hire, where we had a pretty open meeting, and went to Leice&s;ter, where the Lord was plea&s;ed to favour us with a &s;ati&s;|factory meeting. Next day I had a &s;mall meeting at Soilby, things being very low there. From thence to Ca&s;tle-Dumington, and had two meetings, being fir&s;t-day; to which many friends from Nottingham came; they were large, and I believe &s;erviceable meetings to many. Next day I had a &s;mall poor meeting at Wimes-Wood; and went to Longclaw&s;on, where I could perceive very little of the life of religion. From thence to Oakham in Rutland&s;hire, and had a comfortable meeting; truth and its te&s;ti|mony had con&s;iderable dominion. From thence to Leice&s;ter quarterly-meeting; and to Kettering in Northampton&s;hire; where I had a good degree of openne&s;s, and truth prevailed. Then to Wellingborough, on fir&s;t-day, and attended their fore and afternoon meetings; the fir&s;t was a clo&s;e exerci&s;ing time, in a painful &s;ilence, and &s;orrowful &s;en&s;e of the indifference and in|&s;en&s;ibility of many; it was a large meet|ing, and to me, the much greater part ap|peared very ignorant of the importance of that wor&s;hip and &s;ervice they profe&s;&s;ed to meet about. In the afternoon I was favoured with wi&s;dom and &s;trength to di&s;charge my mind, in a clo&s;e &s;earching te&s;timony. The next day I had a meeting to pretty good
<PB N="182" REF="016793_0187_0F9E316BF463B288">
&s;atisfaction, at Rance. The day following I went to the monthly-meeting at Ram&s;ay in Huntingdon&s;hire, where I had good &s;er|vice. After which, had meetings at Ives, Godmanche&s;ter, Erith, and Hadenham; mo&s;t of which were pretty open and &s;er|viceable, through divine help, for without the Lord's ble&s;&s;ing on our labours, they prove altogether fruitle&s;s, the increa&s;e being from him alone. I went next to Milden|hall in Suffolk, where on a fir&s;t-day I had a large meeting to good &s;atisfaction. The next meetings were at Burry, and Haverill; the la&s;t of which, being mo&s;tly people of other &s;ocieties, was open, and the te&s;timo|nies of truth appeared to be well received. I went from thence to Saffron-Walden in E&s;&s;ex, and had a very painful afflicting meeting: very little to be felt of the life of religion therein. Oh! what pity it is, &s;o many up and down, do &s;atisfy them&s;elves with a profe&s;&s;ion of truth; only having a name to live, when they are really dead, as to the quickenings of heavenly virtue. The next meeting I had was at Stebbing; where|in we were favoured with the opening of the living fountain in a good degree; yet there appeared to me to be &s;ome obdurate unfaithful &s;pirits under our profe&s;&s;ion, who &s;eemed out of reach in a &s;orrowful degree, and very hard to be made &s;en&s;ible of the weight and importance of our religious te&s;timonies; e&s;pecially in &s;ome branches
<PB N="183" REF="016793_0188_0F9E316CD7454298">
thereof. Such cau&s;e a &s;ecret pain and an|gui&s;h, which covers the minds of poor tra|vellers in the work of the go&s;pel, like un|to the &s;ackcloth underneath. I &s;eldom found room and opportunity to put it wholly off, though I was frequently favour|ed with a comfortable evidence, that the Lord was with me, graciou&s;ly owning my &s;ervice for him and his people. At the next meeting at Cogge&s;hall, on fir&s;t-day, I had clo&s;e, &s;earching, laborious &s;ervice, and found &s;omething exceeding heavy in that meeting; yet, by divine favour, I was car|ried through to a good degree of &s;atisfaction. Next day I had a meeting at Kelvedon, and another the day following at Witham. At both which, my labour in te&s;timony was very clo&s;e and rou&s;ing; in order, if po&s;|&s;ible, to awaken and &s;tir up lukewarm, un|faithful profe&s;&s;ors; and by the ble&s;&s;ed effi|cacy of the word of life, the whole&s;ome doctrine of truth was &s;et over them, and the few upright-hearted had relief. I went from thence to Chelmsford, where I had good open &s;ervice at their week-day meet|ing, and al&s;o on the fir&s;t-day following: notwith&s;tanding which, a &s;ecret pain ac|companied my mind, occa&s;ioned, in a great mea&s;ure no doubt, by tho&s;e unfaithful pro|fe&s;&s;ors before hinted at, who have neither courage nor fidelity to maintain any branch of our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony, when there ap|pears any probability of outward lo&s;&s;es, or
<PB N="184" REF="016793_0189_0F9E316D14C47B88">
&s;uffering thereby: dealing with our princi|ple in a very lax, indifferent manner, tak|ing what they plea&s;e, and &s;acrificing the re&s;t to their own &s;elfi&s;h views; &s;uch are as &s;pots in our fea&s;ts of charity, and a mourn|ful load to the truly living in religion: but the Lord Almighty, who hears their groanings, will in his own time grant re|lief; and the&s;e &s;hall bear their own bur|dens. I went from Chelmsford to a mar|riage at Dunmow, and from thence to Roy&s;ton in Hertford&s;hire. Things, as to the life of religion, appeared very low there; I had nothing to mini&s;ter unto them but an example of &s;ilence. Next I had a meet|ing at Baldock, which was low and rather painful. I went from thence to Hitching, and was at their fir&s;t-day meetings. They were prety open and &s;atisfactory. From thence to Ampthill, where things appeared low. Then to Hog&s;tyend, where I had &s;ome openne&s;s and &s;atisfaction: at Shering|ton I had a low painful meeting. The next meeting I had was at Northampton, which was a very trying time; but the Lord, by his powerful word, gave me do|minion in a good degree, over dark, liber|tine &s;pirits: things, as to true religion, &s;eemed almo&s;t lo&s;t there. The next meet|ing was at Bugbrook, where I had &s;ome openne&s;s, and got through my &s;ervice to pretty good &s;atisfaction. From thence to Coventry, and was at their meetings on
<PB N="185" REF="016793_0190_0F9E316DCF6D8620">
fir&s;t-day: in one whereof, I had clo&s;e &s;earch|ing labour; I was &s;ilent in the other. The next meeting was at Edington, which was &s;mall, and things but low. I went from thence to a marriage at South-Newton. I found it my place there to &s;it the whole meeting in &s;ilence. The earne&s;t expectation of people, e&s;pecially on &s;uch occa&s;ions, may, and I believe often does, ob&s;truct the cur|rent of right mini&s;try. Silence, if duly con&s;idered, may be the be&s;t le&s;&s;on of in|&s;truction, for tho&s;e who&s;e life is too much in words or outward declarations. I have thought &s;ome among&s;t us are &s;o void of a right under&s;tanding, as to apprehend a kind of nece&s;&s;ity for &s;omething to be done by way of mini&s;try, at marriages, and funerals e&s;pecially; it being hard for them to ap|prehend, that they can be &s;o honourably conducted without. I have therefore ob|&s;erved &s;ome, though but little concerned in the general, to maintain our te&s;timonies by an uniform con&s;i&s;tent deportment, appear very zealous on the&s;e occa&s;ions; taking a deal of pains, and riding many miles, and &s;ometimes from one preacher to another, to make them&s;elves &s;ure of having one; and when they have been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as to prevail upon any to come, it would no doubt be a great di&s;appointment, were they wholly &s;ilent. In this &s;ituation, the mini&s;ter him&s;elf may, unle&s;s well-grounded, be ex|po&s;ed to temptation to gratify &s;uch. My
<PB N="186" REF="016793_0191_0F9E316E884ADD20">
principal view in this remark is, to &s;hew how remote &s;uch are from the truth they profe&s;s, and how nearly allied to &s;ome other profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, who make re|ligion chiefly con&s;i&s;t in outward perform|ances; and think it not like a Chri&s;tian burial, when a corp&s;e is committed to the earth without &s;omething &s;aid over it. If that over-anxiou&s;ne&s;s in the people, above hinted, &s;hould prevail on the preachers among&s;t us, to an&s;wer their cravings and expectations, both in attending, and when there, in gratifying them with words, with|out a due regard to the holy weight and impre&s;&s;ions of the word of life, as the alone moving cau&s;e to public &s;ervice, they would be lo&s;t as to the living body in the &s;o|ciety; and although &s;uch might continue in a con&s;i&s;tent form of &s;ound words and &s;ound doctrine, as to the external appear|ance, yet the &s;ub&s;tance being lo&s;t, their performances would be no more than as &s;ounding bra&s;s, or a tinkling cymbal. Some, to our &s;orrow, have been ob&s;erved to lo&s;e ground by &s;uch means: what can we imagine more offen&s;ive to the gracious, bountiful giver, than to pro&s;titute &s;uch a precious divine gift, by making it &s;ub&s;er|vient to the carnal un&s;anctified de&s;ires of tho&s;e who are &s;trangers to God, yet love to hear of him and his glorious acts, by the hearing of the ear? From this place I went to Hooknorton, and had a meeting;
<PB N="187" REF="016793_0192_0F9E316F81B4D038">
wherein my bu&s;ine&s;s was to example with &s;ilence. I then went to Sibford, where I had a meeting, and &s;ome openne&s;s; yet things were but low. From thence to Banbury, and attended their meetings on a fir&s;t-day. I had open thorough &s;ervice in them, and the te&s;timony of truth was in a good degree exalted. Next day I went to South-Newton again, where I had great openne&s;s, and truth was comfortably in dominion. Much &s;ati&s;|faction is received by following the &s;afe guidance and conduct thereof, whether in heights or depths, &s;ufferings or rejoicings. I had a good meeting next day at a place I forgot the name of; and then to Adderbury, where I had a meeting; things but low. From thence to Bice&s;ter, and had a &s;mall poor meeting; there being but very few under our profe&s;&s;ion, and but little to be felt of the life of religion among&s;t them. My face being now turned towards the city of London, I had a &s;mall meeting at Ayle&s;|bury, and &s;ome open &s;ervice therein to my &s;atisfaction. There are but few friends thereabout. I went to their fir&s;t-day meet|ing at Jordans, which was large: my &s;ervice therein, was to example the people, friends and others, with &s;ilence; which I believe was a con&s;iderable di&s;appointment to many; bat I hope it was profitable to &s;ome. Di|vers friends from London met me there. We lodged that night at a friend's hou&s;e on the way, and got to the city next day. I
<PB N="188" REF="016793_0193_0F9E317008C83EC8">
continued thereabout three weeks, vi&s;iting meetings diligently every day in the week, except the la&s;t, and one more. It was a very painful time of deep &s;uffering in &s;pirit, even beyond all expre&s;&s;ion. I was as a &s;ign of &s;ilence from place to place, e&s;pecially at Grace-Church-Street meeting; which, doubtle&s;s, was a great my&s;tery to many. But it was my way to peace of mind, and I &s;ought after contentment, though it might occa&s;ion me to be accounted a fool, by the lofty towering &s;pirits in that city, who may ju&s;tly be compared to the tall cedars of Lebanon. I left London the 19th of the 10th month, 1749, to vi&s;it the fol|lowing meetings, viz. Hertford, and St. Albans, where our friend Benjamin Kidd met me, and accompanied me to Hemp|&s;tead, Wickham, and the quarterly-meet|ing at Oxford. The meeting there for wor&s;hip was excedingly di&s;turbed and hurt by a rude company of &s;tudents, who came in like a flood, and allowed little or no &s;tillne&s;s, till by breaking up the meeting they di&s;per&s;ed; by which means, we held the meeting for di&s;cipline and good order, in a quiet peaceable manner. After meet|ing I went to Witney; where next day I had a very painful exerci&s;ing time, not only under a &s;en&s;e of undue liberties prevailing, but al&s;o of an exalted &s;elf-righteous, &s;elf-&s;uf|ficient &s;tate; than which, none are harder to be reached unto, or made any impre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="189" REF="016793_0194_0F9E31730E5DA0A8">
upon: my bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;it in &s;ilent &s;uffer|ing with the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;eed. I went next to Burford, where there &s;eemed to me very little of the life of religion. From thence I went to Cirence&s;ter, where my &s;pirit was deeply di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, under a painful &s;en&s;e of wrong things and wrong &s;pirits. The next meeting I went to was Nail&s;worth, where I had clo&s;e &s;earching labour, in te&s;timony again&s;t lukewarmne&s;s and undue liberties. From thence to the quarterly-meeting for Wilt&s;hire; being a &s;tranger and altogether unexpected by friends there, the clo&s;e &s;earching te&s;timony given me to bear, e&s;|pecially relating to the &s;tate of &s;ome active members, might be better taken, and might have more effect, than if the &s;ame had come from one better acquainted with their &s;tates. I always coveted, to be wholly unacquaint|ed with the &s;tates of meetings by outward information, in all my travels; and when, by the di&s;cour&s;e of friends previous to my attending them, there appeared any pro|bability of their inadvertently opening in my hearing, any thing of that kind, I have generally either &s;topped them, or walked away out of hearing; but in general, friends who entertain us in our travels, have more prudence, and a better guard in the&s;e re|&s;pects; as indeed all ought: for it &s;trait|ens, and may give much unea&s;ine&s;s to right &s;pirited mini&s;ters, who have a &s;ure infal|lible guide within, and therefore have no
<PB N="190" REF="016793_0195_0F9E3173EA68DF60">
need of any outward guide or information in their &s;ervices. After this meeting, I vi&s;ited the following meetings in that coun|ty, viz. at the hou&s;e of John Fry, in Sutton. Caln, Chippenham, Mel&s;ham, Cor&s;ham, Bradford, Lavington, and Sali&s;bury, and found things mo&s;tly low, painful, and la|borious to work through; as tho&s;e under our profe&s;&s;ion appeared to me, in too gene|ral a way, &s;atisfying them&s;elves with the religion of their education only; without much experience in the life and virtue there|of, operating upon their hearts. Some, it is to be feared, undertaking to rule and act in the church without a proper qua|lification, and &s;o do not therein &s;eek the honour that cometh from God only. Here the equal balance and &s;tandard is not kept to; partiallity gets place; men and women's per&s;ons are re&s;pected, becau&s;e of riches or outward &s;ub&s;tance: true judgment is per|verted; wickedne&s;s e&s;capes cen&s;ure, to the affecting the whole community, as in the ca&s;e of Achan. Such things provoke the Lord, (who is the only &s;trength and defence of his people) to withdraw. They then be|come languid; their hearts become water, and the inhabitants of the land prevail again&s;t them, till they are in the end made de&s;olate. The next meetings I had were Andover, Whitchurch, Ba&s;ing&s;toke, and Alton; having, through divine help, had &s;ome profitable &s;ervice, tending to warn
<PB N="191" REF="016793_0196_0F9E31752C074168">
and excite friends to a more diligent and careful di&s;charge of the &s;everal duties their &s;tations required: but I could not help viewing, with &s;ome painful reflections, a lukewarmne&s;s and declen&s;ion which &s;or|rowfully prevails in many places. At Alton, which is a large meeting, I found &s;ome &s;olid weighty friends, to whom my &s;pirit was nearly united; having, in the main, good &s;atisfaction and openne&s;s among&s;t them; with &s;earching clo&s;e &s;ervice to the unfaithful; in which I was favoured with the comfortable help of upright &s;pirits, who&s;e &s;incere travel is maintained for an in|crea&s;e of faithful labourers in the Lord's vineyard and the re&s;toring of ancient beauty.</P>
<P>Now did my deep and painful labours in this vi&s;it begin to wear off, and to draw towards a period, as far as related to my travels at this time, in Great-Britain and Ireland. I therefore &s;oon expected a full di&s;charge, as I then &s;aw little before me, &s;ave the city of London. I had meetings at Godalming, Guilford, and E&s;her, in my way thither; in which I had &s;ome &s;ervice to my own &s;atisfaction, and I hope to the help of friends.</P>
<P>I continued in the city &s;ome time, vi&s;it|ing meetings with diligence. My mind being deeply exerci&s;ed as u&s;ual in a painful travel, with and for the &s;uffering &s;eed of God in the hearts of profe&s;&s;ors, who to
<PB N="192" REF="016793_0197_0F9E31755A3AEB88">
me appeared, in too general a way, living, moving, acting and breathing, in an airy exalted region above it. I have often been ready to &s;ay, By whom &s;hall Jacob, the true &s;eed, ari&s;e? for he is very &s;mall in the e&s;teem and regard of profe&s;&s;ors of mo&s;t ranks. Yet I could &s;ee an afflicted &s;uffering remnant, lie very low, as under the ruins, panting, and, as it were, &s;truggling for life. And although we could &s;ee, and knew one another, and travelled together under a de|gree of the &s;ame painful feeling &s;en&s;e of things; yet, not having it in our power to relieve one another, our proper bu&s;ine&s;s was to travel under our re&s;pective burden, un|til the Almighty Deliverer was plea&s;ed to appear, calling his &s;uffering ones to domi|nion and rule with him, who is Lord of Lords and King of Kings: for the Lamb and his followers &s;hall have the victory; though they are permitted &s;ometimes to &s;uf|fer long. I had then, at times, faith to believe he would rai&s;e the dry bones, and they &s;hould &s;tand upon their feet; an army to fight the Lord's battles; to bring the mighty from their &s;eats, and to take the crowns of &s;ome who &s;eemed to reign as kings, from them; making their nakedne&s;s appear. Surely the complaints of the Lord, by the mouth of his prophet concerning I&s;rael, was mournfully verified in the city of London, re&s;pecting a great part of the &s;ociety, viz.
<Q>My people have committed
<PB N="193" REF="016793_0198_0F9E31760E6545B0">
two great evils; they have for&s;aken me the fountain of living waters, and hewn them out ci&s;terns, broken ci&s;terns that can hold no water.</Q>
Such is a profe&s;&s;ion, though of the truth it&s;elf, without the real po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Such is truth in notion, &s;pecu|lation, and imitation only. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of whatever is done in religion, without the immediate influence, direction, and leadings of the holy author's &s;pirit and power. Sound doctrine may be preached, as to words and the main &s;cope thereof, and true principles imbibed from education, tuition, or other outward means; yet the man's part being alive, active, and always ready; the child's and fool's &s;tate, that knows its &s;ufficiency for every good word and work to be immediately received from God alone, is neither experienced nor abode in.
<Q>For it is not you that &s;peak, but the &s;pirit of your Father that &s;peaketh in you, or by you.</Q>
I &s;ay, without this living &s;en&s;e of things, all is but a broken ci&s;tern; it will hold none of the water of life; which is the real cau&s;e, that the endeavours and &s;eeming zeal of &s;ome for the promotion of religion, are &s;o dry, in&s;ipid, and inefficacious. Truth will carry its own evidence. The &s;pring of action being the holy &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, it will gain the a&s;&s;ent of all his children, and an&s;wer his pure witne&s;s in the hearts of the rebellious, far beyond what many con|ceive or imagine. Upon which I would

ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that the only way to pre&s;erve the &s;trength, glory, and dignity of a reli|gious &s;ociety, is for all who undertake to be active in it, certainly to feel the Lord lead|ing and directing them in all their &s;er|vices; and, on the other hand, the &s;ure way to de&s;olation is, when the active mem|bers in religious things move therein by the &s;trength of human abilities only. A great deal depends hereon, more than &s;ome are aware of; it is ob&s;ervable, that the pre|&s;ervation of the Jewi&s;h church in purity, much depended upon the governors and rulers thereof; and &s;o does, and will, the pro&s;perity and purity of the Chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>I had very little openne&s;s in re&s;pect to mini&s;try, but was &s;ilent as u&s;ual, from meeting to meeting. Indeed, my &s;uffer|ings in &s;pirit were exceeding great and deep, day and night, in that city, &s;o that I was weary of this life, and, as it were, &s;ought for death; being at times ready to &s;ay, it is better for me to die than to live. I much wondered why it &s;hould be &s;o; but have &s;ince &s;een, it was in order for the fil|ling up that mea&s;ure of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t allotted to me, which I have &s;een the great advantage of, with re&s;pect to giving dominion over tho&s;e things and &s;pirits, that were the cau&s;e of tho&s;e great &s;ufferings, which could not be &s;tood again&s;t, nor overcome any other way. For, as &s;aith

the apo&s;tle,
<Q>If &s;o be we &s;uffer with Chri&s;t, we &s;hall al&s;o reign with him.</Q>
And our Lord al&s;o &s;aid,
<Q>Verily I &s;ay unto you, that ye which have followed me in the re|generation; when the Son of Man &s;hall &s;it in the throne of his glory, ye al&s;o &s;hall &s;it upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of I&s;rael.</Q>
I have &s;ometimes thought, as I believe it may, by the fore|going account, appear to others, that I was led in a manner &s;omewhat uncommon, to &s;ee and feel the &s;orrowful declen&s;ion of our &s;ociety, in my travels through the&s;e na|tions; though I am very &s;en&s;ible, divers faithful brethren have &s;hared in the like painful travail; which, in &s;ome degree, may be compared with that of Nehemiah; who, under great anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s of mind, entered upon a long and hazardous journey, and went in the night, to view the breaches and de&s;olations made in the city of the great king, before he and the people aro&s;e in the name of the Lord, to build the walls of that city and to &s;et up the gates thereof. For he found the hand of the Lord upon him, moving and &s;trengthening him to &s;eek the good and pro&s;perity of his own people. The&s;e things are written for encouragement and in&s;truction to the painful labourers in the Lord's work; that they faint not under the weight and exerci&s;e thereof; nor think &s;trange concerning &s;uch fiery bapti&s;ms and trials as they may meet with in the
<PB N="196" REF="016793_0201_0F9E68A0073CA170">
cour&s;e of their travels. They may be well a&s;&s;ured, that &s;uch things are all directed in wi&s;dom; which, in the Lord's time, will appear to their full &s;atisfaction and comfort. For it is far from the fountain of infinite kindne&s;s, to permit &s;uch heavy affliction to fall upon his &s;ervants un|nece&s;&s;arily.</P>
<P>I went from London into E&s;&s;ex, in order to vi&s;it &s;ome meetings in that county, which I had not been at before, and was at Chelmsford week-day meeting on fifth-day, where I had good &s;atisfaction. The virtue of truth being &s;hed abroad, to the joy and comfort of the living. On the fir&s;t-day following I was at Colche&s;ter meetings. My mind was painfully depre&s;&s;ed, under a &s;en&s;e that truth &s;uffered much in that place by wrong things: where evil is wink|ed at, and undue liberties in a religious &s;ociety, are &s;uffered to e&s;cape judgment or cen&s;ure; weakne&s;s, and, as it were a cloud of darkne&s;s, comes over meetings as well as individuals. The Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed for his ble&s;&s;ed name's &s;ake, to ari&s;e, and in &s;ome good degree, to di&s;pel the darkne&s;s; whereby truth and the te&s;ti|mony thereof, was exalted over all corrupt un&s;anctified &s;pirits; and the few upright-hearted were &s;weetly comforted; it being a time of relief to their &s;pirits, in a good degree. I went from thence to the follow|ing meetings, viz. Copford, Coln, Hal|&s;tead,
<PB N="197" REF="016793_0202_0F9E68A132A09628">
and Braintree, wherein I had tho|rough &s;ervice, in plain dealing and clo&s;e labour with the unfaithful, of which num|ber there &s;eemed to be many; and but few who had really bought the ble&s;&s;ed truth. It is &s;uch only, who know how precious and valuable it is, and who cannot ea&s;ily be prevailed upon to &s;ell it for a thing of nought, nor even for any con&s;ideration whatever. But it is not &s;o with tho&s;e who have their religion, if it may be &s;o called, by education only, or derived as it were, by way of inheritance like their out|ward po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, from their ance&s;tors. The principles of religion only thus received and held, are often &s;ubjected to temporal conveniency and worldly intere&s;t. Where the world and true religion &s;tand in com|petition with each other, &s;uch profe&s;&s;ors will &s;oon give place to the world; wherein they do really deny Chri&s;t before men, and will as certainly, unle&s;s they repent, be denied by him before the Father and his holy angels. I returned out of E&s;&s;ex to London; for though I had had but little openne&s;s as to mini&s;try there, yet I found my mind engaged to attend their meet|ings, as I apprehended, in order to &s;uffer and travail with the true &s;eed, for its enlarge|ment, as well as to be a &s;ign and example of the important duty of &s;ilence, to the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of truth. They had been long and greatly favoured with living te&s;timonies,

even line upon line, and precept upon pre|cept; under all which, for want of a pro|per application and improvement thereby, the &s;ociety declined, and the ancient beauty thereof greatly faded away; I mean, in what relates to the life and &s;pirit of reli|gion in the practical part thereof; for the body of the &s;ociety every where, as far as ever appeared to me, are remarkably one in faith and profe&s;&s;ion, the &s;ame which hath been held and profe&s;&s;ed by us as a people, from the beginning. This won|derful onene&s;s and agreement among&s;t us every where, (which I have not ob&s;erved, neither do I believe it is to be found among&s;t any other &s;et of Chri&s;tians, to that degree,) is to me a clear evidence, that the original foundation thereof, was the one infallible &s;pirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, who prayed the father, that his followers might be one, as the Father and the Son are one. And notwith&s;tanding great numbers in our &s;o|ciety are re&s;ting &s;atisfied with an empty profe&s;&s;ion, and by their unfaithfulne&s;s, fall greatly &s;hort of the dignity our worthy pre|dece&s;&s;ors attained unto; which, con&s;idering the abundant favours be&s;towed from time to time, for the help and pre&s;ervation of the &s;ociety, is cau&s;e of deep mourning and &s;ore lamentation; yet, there has been, through the kind providence of God, from the beginning down to this time, a living body, pre&s;erved the &s;ame in faith and prac|tice

with our ancients. The&s;e are &s;catter|ed and inter&s;per&s;ed throughout the whole &s;ociety like the &s;alt thereof, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, that all may be &s;ea&s;oned. I think there are very few if any meetings, wholly de&s;titute of &s;ome of that &s;ort; &s;o that I would not have it under&s;tood, by the fore|going mournful complaints, (although there may be ju&s;t cau&s;e for them) that I think the &s;ociety is become de&s;olate, or that the glory is departed therefrom: far be that from me; I am fully convinced to the con|trary, and at times have faith to believe, the glory will never wholly depart, nor &s;hall we cea&s;e to be a living people: yet I believe, numbers under our profe&s;&s;ion, for their great unfaithfulne&s;s and unfruitful|ne&s;s, will be blowed upon by the Lord, and rejected, and others called into the vine|yard, who will be more diligent and faithful.</P>
<P>After I had continued &s;ome time in the city, apprehending my&s;elf nearly clear of further &s;ervice at this time in the&s;e na|tions, and that I might with &s;afety look out for an opportunity of returning to my outward habitation in America; I therefore applied to the brethren here, for a certifi|cate of my travels, &amp;c. which they readily granted; &s;etting forth their unity with my &s;ervices and demeanor under this weighty engagement. But as no &s;uitable opportu|nity appeared likely to pre&s;ent for &s;ome
<PB N="200" REF="016793_0205_0F9E68A2EB7E4700">
time, I had lei&s;ure to look into, and care|fully to weigh an affair of great importance, which had by this time &s;o far prevailed on my attention, that I was afraid wholly to reject it, as I had a con&s;iderable time done on its fir&s;t darting into my thoughts; looking upon it almo&s;t impracticable to be brought about: which was, entering into a married &s;tate with my endeared friend Frances Wyatt, before mentioned. Al|though I never had any other objection to it, than our both being, as far as appeared then to me, &s;ettled in our places; from which I thought it would be very un&s;afe, without the be&s;t coun&s;el, to remove. But that objection was wholly removed, by my way opening (as I thought) with great clear|ne&s;s, to &s;ettle in England on account of my future &s;ervice. I was deeply concerned in my mind to be rightly guided herein; which was an&s;wered &s;o indi&s;putably clear to my under&s;tanding, that I could no longer he&s;itate about it. The next thing was, &s;ettling matters relative thereunto with my &s;aid friend; that &s;o, if &s;he found no objec|tion, our marriage might be accompli&s;hed, if providence permitted, after my returning home, &s;ettling my affairs there, and remove|ing in order to &s;ettle in this nation. I therefore laid the whole before her, as things relating thereunto had appeared to me, de&s;iring her &s;olid con&s;ideration thereof, and an&s;wer, when &s;he was prepared to re|turn
<PB N="201" REF="016793_0206_0F9E68A3AE21CC98">
me one. I found the &s;ame powerful hand which had removed my objections, was at work in her mind to remove hers al&s;o; &s;o that &s;he could not be ea&s;y to put a negative upon the propo&s;al, as believing the thing was right, which was &s;till con|firming to me, We therefore in the fear, and, as we had cau&s;e to believe, in the coun|&s;el of God, engaged with each other, in the relation we then &s;tood, and to accompli&s;h our marriage, when way &s;hould be made by divine providence for the &s;ame. We had no views on either &s;ide for worldly advancement: an anxiou&s;ne&s;s after which appeared to me immaterial, as I was fully per&s;uaded we were directed in our &s;aid engagement, by the wi&s;dom and coun&s;el of him, who can give or take away outward ble&s;&s;ings at his plea&s;ure. I therefore had not freedom, pre|vious to my engaging with her therein, to make any inquiry into her circum&s;tances in the world. All which, however, with the &s;uperior ble&s;&s;ing of an affectionate wife and true help-mate, I afterwards found agreeable and comfortable. Having, as above, paved the way to remove and &s;ettle in England, and a good opportunity pre|&s;enting of a &s;hip, in which &s;everal valuable friends intended to embark; I went on board the Speedwell, John Steven&s;on ma&s;ter, at Grave&s;end, the 8th of the 3d month, 1750, in company with our friends Jonah Thomp&s;on and Mary We&s;ton, who were
<PB N="202" REF="016793_0207_0F9E68A4C5F38388">
going on a religious vi&s;it to the churches in America. We had &s;everal friends on board, and many other pa&s;&s;engers, being fourteen or fifteen of us belonging to the cabin and &s;tate rooms. Some of them were bad peo|ple, who&s;e conver&s;ation proved very di&s;a|greeable to us; &s;o that we &s;pent much of our time on the deck, night and day, except when we took our re&s;t in &s;leep. Our de|parture was from the Start Point, the 11th in the evening, being the la&s;t land &s;een by us until we di&s;covered America. We had a fine gale of wind down the Engli&s;h chan|nel, and a good &s;et off to &s;ea by the &s;ame; but we often had &s;cant, and &s;ometimes con|trary winds afterwards, which made it ra|ther a &s;low pa&s;&s;age, though much quicker than &s;ome have gone. The &s;eventeenth of the 4th month, we found our&s;elves on the banks of Newfoundland, and in the mid&s;t of near twenty &s;ail of French &s;hips who were fi&s;hing there for cod. We &s;poke with one of them, who told us we had about twenty-five fathom water; whereupon the captain ordered the &s;hip to be brought to, that we might take &s;ome fre&s;h cod. This was very agreeable to us all; they &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that in about two hours, there lay upon the deck twenty-four of the fine&s;t cod fi&s;h I ever &s;aw. This proved an agreeable fea&s;t to us for about one week; and altho' through mercy, we had very great plenty of provi&s;ions; yet this was an ac|ceptable

change. It was the 5th of the 5th month, about three o'clock in the after|noon, when to our great joy we &s;aw the land of America; and by &s;ounding, found our&s;elves in about twenty-five fathom water, and entered the Capes of Delaware that night. We had a pro&s;perous gale up the bay and river, &s;o that I landed at Che&s;ter in Penn&s;ylvania, about eight miles from my own hou&s;e, on the 7th of the 5th month about three o'clock in the afternoon, and got home that night; having been on board two months lacking one day, and from home in the whole journey, two years, &s;even months, and eight days; having tra|velled in that time by &s;ea and land, I think on a moderate calculation, 11875 miles, and was at about 560 meetings. I had be|fore concluded, with divine permi&s;&s;ion, to return in the &s;ame &s;hip, and left a large che&s;t of &s;tores on board. When di&s;charged of her loading, &s;he was to &s;ail for Mary|land, there to take in a cargo of tobacco, where I intended meeting her; it being about &s;eventy miles from my hou&s;e. In a day or two after my arrival I went to Phi|ladelphia, where I found my friends gene|rally much alarmed, with news brought by letters in the &s;hip I came over in (for they had not heard it before) of my intention to return, to marry and &s;ettle in England. Many, I believe, being ignorant of the grounds and motives upon which I acted
<PB N="204" REF="016793_0209_0F9E68AB12B0E1B0">
therein, judged concerning the &s;ame from the outward appearance only; &s;uppo&s;ing that having found one I liked, I had let my mind out towards marrying, and made that the principal inducement of my removing. Had this been the ca&s;e, I freely acknowledge that I &s;hould have de&s;erved blame; as acting upon a very dangerous bottom to my&s;elf, and &s;etting an un&s;afe example for others to follow; believing &s;ome have &s;u&s;tained great lo&s;s, by inadvertent &s;teps of this kind, in their travels on truth's account. This was what I greatly feared in relation to my|&s;elf, and therefore (as before hinted) dur&s;t not give way to the thoughts of entangling my&s;elf therein, until I had repeatedly (as I thought at lea&s;t) received clear evidence in my mind, of its being my duty to re|move into this nation for future &s;ervice. I do therefore earne&s;tly caution all, to be aware of taking any encouragement from my example herein, unle&s;s they have the &s;ame evidence, and act upon the &s;ame bot|tom as I did agreeable to what is above-mentioned, and are well a&s;&s;ured of divine direction, as I was. That I was rightly guided in my removal, has not only been fully confirmed to my&s;elf &s;ince, but, I am per&s;uaded al&s;o, to many others: and even at that time, tho&s;e who were free enough to confer with me thereon, appeared to be well &s;atisfied, whom for their freedom and openne&s;s to me on that account, I looked
<PB N="205" REF="016793_0210_0F9E68AB22DE9ED8">
upon to be &s;ome of my be&s;t friends; and as to others, I thought it my duty to bear with patience and meekne&s;s all they were plea&s;ed to &s;ay and conjecture, until time made manife&s;t who were in the right.</P>
<P>I attended the yearly-meeting held at Burlington, for Penn&s;ylvania and the Jer|&s;eys, in the &s;eventh month, wherein the Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to over&s;hadow our large a&s;&s;emblies with his heavenly power and pre&s;ence, to our great comfort and edification; having with joy to draw water out of the wells of &s;alvation, and to offer the prai&s;e and humble thank&s;giving to the alone fountain thereof, who is for ever worthy.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled my affairs, and obtained a certificate of removal from the monthly meeting of Darby, in Che&s;ter county, in Penn&s;ylvania, to which I belonged, directed to the monthly-meeting of Witham in E&s;&s;ex, Old England; my&s;elf and daughter &s;et out from my own hou&s;e in Darby afore|&s;aid, accompanied by my &s;i&s;ter Mary (who &s;ince my wife's decea&s;e, had been my good careful hou&s;e-keeper) together with &s;everal friends, the 12th of the 8th month, 1750. We travelled to Ea&s;t Nottingham, being about &s;ixteen miles from the place where the &s;hip lay in which I intended to em|bark. My &s;i&s;ter and one of the friends &s;taid with us about a week, and then took their &s;olemn leave. My daughter and I
<PB N="206" REF="016793_0211_0F9E68AF16D73AA0">
&s;taid thereabout until the 2d of the 9th month. I vi&s;ited &s;ome meetings in the neighbourhood to good &s;atisfaction, and was at many in Ea&s;t Nottingham, it being a very large meeting, and a zealous body of friends then belonged thereto; among&s;t whom I had good &s;ervice and great open|ne&s;s; the precious unity of the one &s;pirit being livingly enjoyed, in which we took a &s;olemn farewel of one another. The 2d of the 9th month afore&s;aid we &s;et out, ac|companied by divers of our worthy friends, and cro&s;&s;ed the great river Su&s;quehannah, taking our quarters at Jacob Giles's hou&s;e within &s;ight of the &s;hip; but were not or|dered on board until the 8th. We did not &s;ail until the 11th at noon. The un&s;kilful pilot ran us a-ground twice that afternoon, and cau&s;ed the poor &s;ailors hard labour and much fatigue, which I was &s;orry for. It was the 18th about two o'clock in the afternoon, before we got clear of Che&s;apeak bay; having then a fine wind, we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of land.</P>
<P>We had been at &s;ea but about four days, when he e&s;pied a &s;ail or two, who, by their motions, appeared very de&s;irous to &s;peak with us, which, at length, one of them belonging to Rhode-I&s;land effected, inform|ing us, they were reduced to a very &s;mall quantity of provi&s;ions, and earne&s;tly intreat|ing the ma&s;ter to afford them &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. He, to my grief and &s;urpri&s;e, gave
<PB N="207" REF="016793_0212_0F9E68B0687C6528">
them a very &s;hort denial; allegeing we were but newly come out to &s;ea, and did not yet know what we might want our|&s;elves. I was very much troubled in my mind at the hardne&s;s of his heart, and im|mediately &s;tepped up to him, and in as moving language as I was capable of, in|terceded for the poor &s;ufferers. The fir&s;t mate being a man of a good di&s;po&s;ition, joined with me herein. We at length &s;o prevailed on the ma&s;ter, that he gave them liberty to hoi&s;t out their boat, and come on board us; telling them he would &s;ee what could be done for them; which, poor creatures, they gladly complied with; the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip and four of his &s;ailors, being quickly on board of us. It was very affecting, to behold want &s;o con&s;picuous in their faces, and to &s;ee how greatly they re|joiced, with thankfulne&s;s, that kind pro|vidence had, in mercy, ca&s;t us in their way, for their relief; in which I could heartily join with them; much rejoicing we had not inhumanly turned them off without help. The ma&s;ter, (to give him his due,) did at la&s;t hand to them pretty liberally; for which he charged what he thought pro|per, and took that ma&s;ter's draught for the money, on his owner in London. I &s;pared them &s;ome out of my private &s;tore, for which I wanted no other pay, than the &s;atisfaction of relieving their great wants;
<PB N="208" REF="016793_0213_0F9E68B20505B888">
being very glad I had been in&s;trumental thereunto.</P>
<P>The next day we had a great &s;torm, and an exceeding high &s;ea, &s;o that we could carry no &s;ail, but fa&s;tened the helm and let the &s;hip drive wither&s;oever the wind and waves would carry her: we were in|deed mightily to&s;&s;ed; but through divine favour, my mind was &s;weetly calm and comfortable, feeling his living pre&s;ence who is God of the &s;eas and the dry land, to be near. My heart was filled with the joy of his &s;alvation, &s;o that I could &s;ing and make melody therein to him; in which I had confirming evidence, as I many times had under the &s;ame precious enjoyment, both by &s;ea and land after I left England, that my way and undertaking was approved of the Lord, and would be ble&s;&s;ed and pro&s;pered by him; which yielded more com|fort to my mind, than any thing in this world could do. The &s;evere&s;t part of the &s;torm la&s;ted but about twelve hours; and altho' we had two con&s;iderable &s;torms after|wards, yet for the mo&s;t part, it was a ready good pa&s;&s;age. On the 17th of the 10th month in the morning, we &s;ounded, and in &s;ixty-nine fathom water we found ground. The &s;ame morning about ten o'clock, we had the very agreeable &s;ight of England. Next day, the wind being again&s;t us, we made but lit|tle advantage of &s;ailing. The nineteenth about eight o'clock at night, we came to
<PB N="209" REF="016793_0214_0F9E68B2B1C1B778">
an anchor in Falmouth harbour. Going on &s;hore next day, we went to an inn in the town. Our kind ho&s;pitable friend Jo&s;eph Tregellis, came and invited us to his hou&s;e, where we had generous entertainment whil&s;t we were at that place. I was &s;eve|ral times at their meetings, both at Fal|mouth and Penryn, and had openne&s;s and good &s;atisfaction. My worthy friends of that town, Andrew Hinge&s;ton and his wife, and daughter, were affectionately kind to me, which I cannot well avoid mentioning, out of a grateful &s;en&s;e I retain thereof, as we were entire &s;trangers; for I had not been that way when in England before.</P>
<P>Having been detained there about a week, we put out to &s;ea again, in order to proceed to London, whither we were bound. The &s;econd-day of our being out, towards even|ing, as we were &s;ailing within about a league and half of Dover, a boat from thence came on board for letters. The wind then not being fair to go up the River Thames, we went with them to Dover, and next day to Grave&s;end, where cro&s;&s;ing the water at Grays in E&s;&s;ex, I proceeded from thence to Chelmsford.</P>
<P>My dear friend Frances Wyatt and I, after proceeding according to the good order of friends, accompli&s;hed our mar|riage with each other, at a large meeting of friends and others in Chelmsford meet|ing-hou&s;e, the 14th day of the then 1&s;t

month, 1750-1, in the &s;weet and &s;en&s;ible en|joyment of his pre&s;ence, who &s;aw in the be|ginning, it was not good for man to be alone; and therefore he did, in great kind|ne&s;s, provide an help-mate to be with him, who was bone of his bone, and fle&s;h of his fle&s;h. It is therefore &s;aid, they &s;hall be no more twain, but one fle&s;h. The Lord then joined the man and his wife together. Happy would it have been for mankind, had they never &s;ought, nor found out any other way of joining in that relation &s;ince. But as the &s;ons (or wor&s;hippers) of the true God, formerly looked upon the daughters of men, with an eye that tendeth to prevert this ordinance, making it only an&s;wer the ba&s;e ends of carnal de&s;ire; following the dictates of their own evil heart, in&s;tead of the coun&s;el of God, in this great undertak|ing; &s;o it is evidently the ca&s;e at this day with too many. It is al&s;o often not &s;o much what the woman or man is, as what worldly &s;ub&s;tance they have. Where there is plenty of that, many real defects, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e qualifications and en|dowments e&s;&s;ential to real happine&s;s in a married &s;tate, are over-looked. Thus, by man's ignorantly and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly taking upon him the guidance and government of him&s;elf, in&s;tigated thereunto by the &s;ubtilty of Satan; tho&s;e outward accomodations, which were by divine providence intended as ble&s;&s;ings, become quite the rever&s;e. To

prevent &s;uch unhappy con&s;equences to young people and others, I know of no advice bet|ter adapted for their &s;afety and pre&s;ervation, than that of our Lord's, viz.
<Q>Seek ye fir&s;t the kingdom of God, and his righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and all the&s;e things &s;hall be added unto you.</Q>
Tho&s;e who have happily, by &s;eeking, found this kingdom, and live therein, which con&s;i&s;teth in righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, have great advantage, even in outward things, above all others; as the ble&s;&s;ing of God, which maketh truly rich, attends all their worldly affairs. They enjoy what appertains to this life with a proper reli&s;h.
<Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are the meek, for they &s;hall inherit the earth,</Q>
Mat. v. 5. As it is man's duty and &s;afety to &s;eek the Lord's coun&s;el and ble&s;&s;ing; &s;o it is truly honourable among&s;t men: for this, Jabez was &s;aid to be more honourable than his brethren; for he called on the God of I&s;rael, &s;aying,
<Q>Oh, that thou woulde&s;t ble&s;s me indeed, and enlarge my coa&s;t, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou woulde&s;t keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me!</Q>
And God granted him that which he reque&s;ted. Let me conclude this ob&s;ervation with ten|der advice and caution to all whom it may concern, into who&s;e hands this may come, to be aware they do not fall into that dan|gerous &s;nare of &s;uppo&s;ing, as marriage is an outward affair, they need con&s;ult nothing

further therein than their own inclination, and their own rea&s;on; it is &s;aid,
<Q>Woe to the rebellious children, that a&s;k coun&s;el, but not of me, &s;aith the Lord.</Q>
And Chri&s;t is called, Wonderful, Coun&s;ellor, as well as a mighty God. Now as marriage is allowed to be the mo&s;t important affair in this life, and may tend greatly either to promote our happine&s;s or mi&s;ery in the next; if we have no occa&s;ion to &s;eek the Lord's coun&s;el herein, in what are we to expect or de&s;ire it? Abraham's &s;ervant, when he was only engaged about procure|ing a wife for his younger ma&s;ter I&s;aac, with great earne&s;tne&s;s &s;ought the Lord's guidance and ble&s;&s;ing therein, and obtained it in a remarkable manner. What (&s;ay &s;ome) are we to look for, or to expect a revelation in &s;uch ca&s;es? We mu&s;t de&s;ire the Lord to guide and direct our &s;teps in this, and all other affairs of con&s;equence in relation to this life, or we &s;hall certainly mi&s;s our way. But this we cannot clearly under&s;tand, un|til the man's part is reduced in us, and we &s;ee what we are without God, that we may find occa&s;ion to pray without cea&s;ing, and in every thing to give thanks. Then the con&s;tant cry will be, Guide me with thy coun&s;el. When this is, with great &s;incerity, the &s;tate of the mind, we cannot mi&s;s our way; becau&s;e divine protection is ever pre&s;ent, although we do not always &s;ee it, no more than the prophet's &s;ervant

When this is the ca&s;e, we &s;ay, if this or that be not agreeable to thy will, O God, thou ha&s;t all power in thine hand; do thou, by thy over-ruling providence, direct me according to thy ble&s;&s;ed will.

<P>We &s;ettled together after marriage, at Chelmsford in the county of E&s;&s;ex, where I enjoyed great &s;atisfaction and comfort in an affectionate wife. Yet &s;uch I found the low and almo&s;t de&s;olate &s;ituacion of our &s;ociety in the &s;aid county; e&s;pecially in relation to good order and that di&s;cipline e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t us, by the power, and in the wi&s;dom of truth, as a hedge to de|fend and pre&s;erve from hurtful things, that it gave me much painful concern of mind. The difference appearing &s;o very great, as I had before re&s;ided where di&s;cipline in the general was well maintained. I could not di&s;cover, either by their books or inquiry, that the unfaithful or di&s;orderly walkers had (a few in&s;tances excepted) been for many years regularly dealt with, and their mi&s;conduct cen&s;ured, either by monthly or quarterly meetings. I diligently attended tho&s;e meetings, but my &s;pirit was greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed therein, as the members &s;eemed to move and act in another element (as I
<PB N="214" REF="016793_0219_0F9E68BB0BF0EA50">
may &s;ay) than that I had been accu&s;tomed to, in managing the weighty affairs of the church. The fir&s;t thing of importance that laid hold of my mind, as wanting to be reformed, was relating to women's meet|ings&punc; there being no &s;uch held quarterly, nor at but few of the monthly meetings; and where there was any thing of that nature it was of little or no &s;ervice, in the manner then held. Having therefore the advices and directions of the yearly-meeting, rela|ting to women's meetings, I reque&s;ted li|berty of the quarterly-meeting to read the &s;ame therein, which I did, making &s;uch remarks thereon, as appeared to me then nece&s;&s;ary. At the &s;ame time I propo&s;ed, that the meeting &s;hould take that weighty affair, of e&s;tabli&s;hing women's quarterly and monthly meetings, agreeable to the repeat|ed pre&s;&s;ing advices of the yearly-meeting, into &s;olid con&s;ideration; and if it was thought proper, that a few friends might be appointed to form &s;ome general direc|tions for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our women friends, pointing out to them (as for want of oppor|tunity, they were pretty much &s;trangers thereunto) how &s;uch meetings are to be conducted, and the part of church di&s;ci|pline that properly comes under their no|tice, and requires the management of the women. All which was agreed to, and minuted. The propo&s;ed directions were pre|pared by the friends appointed, brought to
<PB N="215" REF="016793_0220_0F9E68BC8B136748">
the next quarterly-meeting, and there agreed to. The women having previous notice, withdrew at the clo&s;e of the meeting of wor&s;hip, into an apartment, to receive what we had to lay before them, and una|nimou&s;ly agreed thereunto. A quarterly meeting of women friends being then e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, pre&s;&s;ing advice was &s;ent by minute, to monthly meetings, that they &s;hould en|courage and e&s;tabli&s;h women's meetings among&s;t them al&s;o, which was complied with. And although our women friends, for want of being brought up by their an|ce&s;tors in the management of the di&s;ci|pline, might be rather unexperienced at fir&s;t, yet I am well a&s;&s;ured, this &s;tep tended much to enlarge our meetings, and to make them more lively; opening the way of &s;in|cere travellers to a fuller enjoyment of &s;piritual good, wherein alone is our ability for every good word and work. Some few, from a right &s;en&s;e of the importance of the work, joined me in an earne&s;t labour for a general reformation, and as we felt the weight of things upon our minds, we gave up to vi&s;it monthly-meetings, to help the weak, and to move forward the wheels of di&s;cipline, which, e&s;pecially at the fir&s;t, moved very heavily; for although we had many in the county under our profe&s;&s;ion, yet few of them had their hands clean e|nough to handle the affairs of the church; many being, as it were, crippled with un|faithfulne&s;s,
<PB N="216" REF="016793_0221_0F9E68BD278E3880">
e&s;pecially in their mean and cowardly compliance with the anti-chri&s;|tian demand of tythes, and things of that nature, which of it&s;elf unfits for &s;ervice among&s;t us; for I never &s;aw much, if any, true living zeal for the cau&s;e of God, in tho&s;e who have fallen into this defection. Oh! the darkae&s;s and cau&s;e of &s;tumbling it has occa&s;ioned in this poor county, and in other places where it hath prevailed. We found our&s;elves concerned, repeatedly to vi&s;it &s;uch in their families, labouring in Chri&s;tian love, to bring them into a &s;en&s;e of the incon&s;i&s;tency of their conduct with their profe&s;&s;ion therein; which labour, though prevalent with &s;ome, hath been no otherwi&s;e &s;ucce&s;sful in general, than the di&s;charge of that duty, which one mem|ber of a religious community owes to ano|ther; and by bringing the judgment of truth in &s;ome degree over them, they be|came more di&s;tingui&s;hed from the faithful. We had great peace in this labour, though hard and unplea&s;ant, as we found them dark and difficult to be reached unto, a few excepted. However, the&s;e endeavours great|ly tended to exalt truth's te&s;timony, for which our worthy predece&s;&s;ors deeply &s;uf|fered. In proce&s;s of time, through the ble&s;&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our holy head, en|gaging a &s;mall remnant to labour in the monthly and quarterly-meetings for a re|formation, good order hath been much pro|moted,
<PB N="217" REF="016793_0222_0F9E68BDE4BAC178">
and our Chri&s;tian di&s;cipline, in its &s;everal branches, has been in a good degree put in practice; and &s;ome came to under|&s;tand, it is nece&s;&s;ary to receive wi&s;dom and &s;trength from God, for the maintaining that work. So that although things, in that re&s;pect, through the un&s;oundne&s;s and lukewarmne&s;s of many profe&s;&s;ors, are now low, yet the Lord continues to be gracious, in affording us the ble&s;&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his holy &s;pirit, both in our meetings for divine wor&s;hip, and tho&s;e for di&s;cipline; whereby &s;ome are enabled in meekne&s;s to labour for the maintaining his cau&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;couragement they meet with, not only from a view of the languid &s;tate of the &s;o|ciety in general, but al&s;o from the brittle jealous &s;pirits of &s;ome. Having laboured in our own county, according to ability received of God (for without his divine a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, I have, by long experience, known I could do nothing) I attended the yearly-meetings in London as they fell in cour&s;e, therein to join with the &s;incere travellers for Sion's pro&s;perity, in the important care of truth's affairs throughout the world. This weighty engagement coming more upon &s;ome of us than heretofore, as many of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ers and faithful labourers were re|moved to their re&s;t. Our valuable friends John Churchman and William Brown from Penn&s;ylvania, were at &s;everal of the fir&s;t yearly-meetings after my &s;ettling in this
<PB N="218" REF="016793_0223_0F9E68BEE05EBE40">
nation. They laboured in the&s;e nations, in the &s;ervice of truth, near four years, having left affectionate wives and children for truths &s;ake. Such noble di&s;intere&s;ted endeavours, without any view towards tem|poral intere&s;t, is a very great my&s;tery to the worldly wi&s;e. The above named friends were great and good in&s;truments in the Lord's hand, not only at the yearly-meet|ings, but al&s;o in their travels up and down, for the promotion of di&s;cipline and good order in the churches; though not without con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition from &s;ome, who, under pretence of acting for the good of the &s;ociety, were in reality advocates for undue liberty. Notwith&s;tanding &s;ome &s;uch difficulties, the Lord hath greatly &s;trength|ened the hands of his pained ones for Sion's welfare, and ble&s;&s;ed his work to the pro|moting of good order, as the likelie&s;t means of reviving ancient beauty and comeline&s;s; there having been great &s;tirrings, and much labour of late years, to bring the &s;everal members of the &s;ociety into the holy order of the go&s;pel. May the Lord yet continue the ble&s;&s;ing of wi&s;dom and &s;trength, that the work may be carried on, to the prai&s;e of his worthy name and the pre&s;ervation of his people, is the earne&s;t prayer of my &s;oul!</P>
<P>I &s;et out the 16th of the 6th month, 1751, intending to take &s;ome meetings in my way to the circular yearly-meeting for
<PB N="219" REF="016793_0224_0F9E68C01532E528">
the we&s;tern counties, to be held at Broom&s;|grove in Worce&s;ter&s;hire, and from thence to vi&s;it the meetings of friends in Wales. I fir&s;t went to the burial of a friend at Steb|bing, and proceeded through Walden, Cam|bridge, and Huntington, to Wellingbo|rough in Northampton&s;hire; and attended both their meetings on a fir&s;t-day; having clo&s;e earne&s;t labour, in a &s;en&s;e of great dullne&s;s, and much in&s;en&s;ibility prevailing on many profe&s;&s;ors. My &s;pirit was greatly burdened therewith; but the Lord was plea&s;ed to ari&s;e, and di&s;pel the darkne&s;s in a good degree, giving me thorough &s;ervice, e&s;pecially in the afternoon; I hope not ea&s;ily to be forgot. I went away greatly relieved, and had a meeting at Coventry, which was heavy and laborious, though I was, through divine favour, enabled to wade through to mine own ea&s;e, in a good degree. I had a good open meeting that evening at Nun-Eaton; there being but one family of friends in the town, but a large number of others were at the meeting; divers of whom &s;eemed pretty much affected with the te&s;ti|mony of truth. I had a clo&s;e exerci&s;ing meeting the next day at Ather&s;tone, where things were very low, yet truth aro&s;e and opened doctrine for their help. I had a meeting that evening at Pole&s;worth, which was open and comfortable. From thence I went to Woolverhampton, where I had a &s;mall meeting, things being very low.
<PB N="220" REF="016793_0225_0F9E68C022DD6A40">
After which I went to Colebrook Dale, where I had a meeting, and clo&s;e thorough &s;ervice, tending to &s;tir up friends to dili|gence, as well as to encourage the upright-hearted. I went from thence to Shrew&s;|bury: the number of profe&s;&s;ors there was very &s;mall, and the life of religion very much depre&s;&s;ed, not only by the lukewarm|ne&s;s of &s;ome, but al&s;o by a bla&s;ting, windy, lifele&s;s mini&s;try, which they had long &s;at under; doubtle&s;s, to the great unea&s;ine&s;s of the few &s;en&s;ible among&s;t them. I had a painful &s;en&s;e of the great hurt thereof in that meeting, being concerned to &s;it the whole meeting through in &s;ilence, I be|lieve, as an example to friends, and rebuke to that forward un&s;anctified &s;pirit: the &s;ame &s;oon after was made manife&s;t to both friends and others, to be very corrupt, and was de&s;ervedly te&s;tified again&s;t by the monthly-meeting. I have divers times, in my travels, perceived great hurt to the pro|&s;perity of truth, by &s;uch un&s;anctified pre|tenders to a divine commi&s;&s;ion, intruding them&s;elves into the mini&s;try; but always have apprehended them a bad &s;ort of people to deal with by advice and caution, as they are commonly very po&s;itive and &s;elf-willed; being &s;eldom, in this declined &s;tate of the church, without a party, who had rather have almo&s;t any kind of mini&s;try than &s;ilence; which makes it much more difficult for tho&s;e who have a right &s;en&s;e of their
<PB N="221" REF="016793_0226_0F9E68C45790E5E0">
&s;pirits, to bring the judgment of truth over &s;uch; as tho&s;e above-mentioned are apt to &s;creen them, and cover their heads, unle&s;s they manife&s;t them&s;elves, which hath in the end frequently happened, by their being guilty of &s;ome immoral conduct. I went af|ter meeting to vi&s;it two friends, who had been impri&s;oned there a con&s;iderable time for refu&s;ing to pay tythes. As &s;oon as I had entered the place of their confinement, I &s;en&s;ibly felt the Son of peace was there. My mind being brought into great nearne&s;s, unity, and Chri&s;tian &s;ympathy with them in their &s;uffering &s;tate, which they appear|ed to bear with chearfulne&s;s, and true re|&s;ignation to the divine will. The &s;en&s;e of the great importance of that te&s;timony they were concerned to maintain, by &s;uffering for it, and what our worthy predece&s;&s;ors went through, in na&s;ty &s;tinking pri&s;ons and dungeons, where many of them ended their days in &s;upport thereof, who may be very ju&s;tly numbered among&s;t the faithful mar|tyrs of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, overcame my mind with tenderne&s;s to that degree, that I could not pre&s;ently di&s;cour&s;e with them about their &s;ufferings. We had a ble&s;&s;ed oppor|tunity together, and took our leave of each other, in the &s;weet enjoyment of the pure love of God. Oh, how much more joyous and refre&s;hing it is to vi&s;it &s;uch faithful &s;ufferers, than to vi&s;it carnal profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame truth, who violate that precious

te&s;timony, by voluntary putting into the prie&s;ts mouths, le&s;t they &s;hould prepare war again&s;t them, making religion bow down to their &s;uppo&s;ed temporal intere&s;t, thereby not only declaring them&s;elves mere pretenders thereunto, but al&s;o increa&s;ing the &s;ufferings of tho&s;e under the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion who dare not temporize! I returned from thence to Colebrook Dale, where I had a hard trying meeting held in &s;ilence; and went to Birmingham, where I had divers times been before, and generally had painful la|borious meetings; but now it plea&s;ed divine goodne&s;s to favour with openne&s;s and good authority, to declare the truth largely; I believe to the &s;tirring up of the carele&s;s, at lea&s;t to a pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e of their duties; as well as to the comfort and edification of the hone&s;t-hearted, to my own peace and great relief. From this place I went to Broom&s;|grove, in order to attend the yearly-meet|ing before-mentioned, which began on fir&s;t-day, the 1&s;t of the 7th month, being held in a barn, fitted up by friends for that pur|po&s;e: it ended the third-day following; many mini&s;tring friends attended it, &s;ome of whom were largely opened by the power and wi&s;dom of truth, to publi&s;h the go&s;|pel tidings with clearne&s;s and good demon|&s;tration. The people, though numerous, being generally very &s;till and attentive, appeared to receive the te&s;timony of truth with plea&s;ure, and things were in the main
<PB N="223" REF="016793_0228_0F9E68C628E7C188">
well conducted. Here my friend John Bradford joined me as a companion. We had a large meeting at Worce&s;ter on fourth-day, in which truth had comfortable domi|nion, e&s;pecially near the conclu&s;ion, to the great &s;atisfaction and joy of many hearts. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord our God, for his con|tinued favours to his people! On the fifth-day we had a &s;mall poor meeting at Broom|yard in Hereford&s;hire; things being very low in that place, as to truth and friends. On &s;ixth-day we had a meeting at Leomin|&s;ter; the fore part was very cloudy and painful, yet by the gracious &s;pringing up of light and life, I got through my &s;ervice therein to good &s;atisfaction. The next day, being the &s;eventh of the week, I went to my dear mother's in Radnor&s;hire. On fir&s;t-day, the neighbours being apprized of my being come, flocked to the Pales meet|ing in abundance. The Lord was plea&s;ed to favour me with a large open time, to declare his everla&s;ting truth among&s;t them, with which they appeared to be much af|fected. I had &s;uch another opportunity with friends and many others, at Talcoyd, near my mother's hou&s;e. They &s;eemed greatly affected with the virtue of truth; but I doubt they &s;tumble at the cro&s;s. On &s;econd-day we had a meeting at a place cal|led the Coom, about &s;ix miles from my mother's, pretty open and comfortable. On fourth-day, the 11th, I took leave of my
<PB N="224" REF="016793_0229_0F9E68C6E6E99028">
worthy affectionate mother, relations and friends thereabout, having my brother Ben|jamin for our guide over the bleak moun|tains into Cardigan&s;hire. The wind blew hard and it rained, but through mercy we received very little harm thereby. Next day we had a &s;mall poor meeting at one Evans's; religion being at a very low ebb in that place; my chief bu&s;ine&s;s, as far as I could &s;ee, was to detect a vile impo&s;tor, who had, by a feigned and hypocritical &s;hew, got the advantage of the weakne&s;s and credulity of friends there. I never had &s;een him before, that I know of, but my &s;pirit was exceedingly burdened with his deceitful groanings and feigned agitation in the meeting, and was then &s;atisfied his &s;pirit was very foul and corrupt, as it was like a nui&s;ance to me all the time. I warn|ed friends to be aware of him; and to keep him at a di&s;tance; but they &s;eemed willing to hope that there was &s;ome good in him, as he appeared &s;o much concerned in meet|ings, &amp;c. &s;o I &s;aw whereabout they who pleaded thus were them&s;elves, as they &s;eemed taken with, and rather to approve of what was &s;o very offen&s;ive and even odious to me in that meeting, viz. his pretended exerci&s;e therein. But if people will lay hold &s;uddenly on &s;uch, they mu&s;t partake with them in their &s;ins; for this man di&s;covered him&s;elf to be very bad, by being guilty of gro&s;s wickedne&s;s. I think

the meeting was held in &s;ilence. After which, we went to a place called Penbank in Carmarthen&s;hire, where a meeting was held next day to pretty good &s;atisfaction, being favoured with matter and utterance for their help; though things appeared low; the &s;ame day in the evening I had a very poor afflicting meeting at Penplace; great &s;lackne&s;s and weakne&s;s appeared in the few profe&s;&s;ors there. We were quite &s;ilent as to public mini&s;try. We went from thence to Carmarthen, and attended their meet|ings on a fir&s;t-day; had good open &s;ervice therein, e&s;pecially in the afternoon, many of the neighbours coming in: the te&s;timony of truth went forth freely and largely a|mong&s;t them, with which they appeared to be much reached and affected; and might, I hope, tend to remove a prejudice they had imbibed, from the mi&s;conduct of one or more, of high pretentions lately in that place, but then removed. We had a meet|ing on &s;econd-day in the evening, at Laugh|arn, where very few, if any, properly of our &s;ociety, re&s;ided; many of the neigh|bours came in; we had a good opportunity among&s;t them, in the free extendings of go&s;pel love; the doctrine whereof &s;eemed to have a con&s;iderable reach upon them. On third-day we had a meeting among&s;t a few profe&s;&s;ors at James-town; it being their harve&s;t time, they &s;eemed more concerned about their corn than religion; &s;everal ru&s;h|ing

out, in a di&s;orderly manner, to take care of that, as there was &s;ome appearance of rain. It was with much difficulty we procured a guide to Haverfordwe&s;t. At length we prevailed on a young woman, who &s;eemed to have the mo&s;t lively &s;en&s;e of religion of any among&s;t them. Having a large ferry to cro&s;s over Milford Haven, by &s;uch difficulties we were &s;o hindered, as not to reach the afore&s;aid place, until about an hour after the time appointed for the meeting, to our great unea&s;ine&s;s. This meeting was, for the mo&s;t part, held in &s;ilence; yet near the conclu&s;ion, I had &s;ome things given me to deliver, with con&s;idera|ble weight and go&s;pel authority. I went next to Red&s;tone, where the meeting was &s;mall, yet open and comfortable. From thence we travelled to Carmarthen, and next day to Swan&s;ey, about thirty miles, being a very rough open road; the day very &s;tormy, &s;o that we were exceedingly wet. Great care was taken of us, when we got to our friend Paul Bevan's hou&s;e, &s;o that, through mercy, we received but very little harm. On fir&s;t-day, being the 22d, we attended their meetings: that in the fore|noon was held in a &s;ilent labour. In the afternoon I had a clo&s;e &s;earching te&s;timony to bear, tending to &s;tir up and rou&s;e friends to more zeal and fervor of mind; and was favoured to get through to &s;atisfaction. On third-day we had a poor &s;mall meet|ing
<PB N="227" REF="016793_0232_0F9E68C9474F23B8">
among&s;t a few friends at Freeveraque. I had nothing to admini&s;ter, but an example of &s;ilence. We went after meeting to Pon|typool, and next day had a precious open meeting there. The te&s;timony of truth going forth with good authority and clear|ne&s;s, was exalted, and the upright in heart were &s;weetly comforted in the enjoyment of the Lord's pretence, returning him the prai&s;e, who is worthy for ever! On &s;ixth-day, the 27th, we cro&s;&s;ed the Severn at the New-Pa&s;&s;age, and went that night to the widow Young's at Earthcott; had a hard trying meeting there next day; after which we went to Bri&s;tol, and on fir&s;t-day the 29th, we attended three meetings there; the two fir&s;t were held in a painful di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing &s;ilence, and the la&s;t al&s;o, except a few words near the breaking up of the meet|ing. This was the fir&s;t of my vi&s;iting that city, and a time not ea&s;ily to be forgot by me. It was indeed a &s;ea&s;on of &s;ore mourn|ing and lamentation, in a &s;en&s;e of their great declen&s;ion. But very little to be &s;een or felt of that plainne&s;s, pure &s;implicity, humility, and contempt of the world, &s;o con&s;picuous in their worthy predece&s;&s;ors, who trampled upon the glory of this world, counting all as dro&s;s and dung, in compa|ri&s;on of the &s;miles of the Lord's counte|nance, and being cloathed with the beauti|ful garment of his &s;alvation. Oh, how was the choice&s;t vine planted, made to &s;pread,
<PB N="228" REF="016793_0233_0F9E68CD4DD8C4F0">
and mightily to pro&s;per, through great &s;ufferings and per&s;ecution, in that city, in early times; &s;ufficiently, one would think, to have deeply e&s;tabli&s;hed the permanency thereof, and to have recommended its &s;u|perior dignity and excellency to many ge|nerations! May not that of the apo&s;tle to the Galatians, be ju&s;tly applied to them? viz.
<Q>O fooli&s;h Galatians! who hath be|witched you, that you &s;hould not obey the truth? Before who&s;e eyes Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath been evidently &s;et forth, &amp;c. Are ye &s;o fooli&s;h, having begun in the &s;pirit, are ye now made perfect by the fle&s;h?</Q></P>
<P>I parted with my companion at Bri&s;tol, and turned my face homewards, taking meetings in my way to London, at French-hay, Cor&s;ham, Chippenham, Caln, and Read|ing; in all which I had con&s;iderable open|ne&s;s, largely, and with good authority, to publi&s;h the doctrine of truth, to mine own peace, and I hope to the comfort and help of many; though in &s;ome places my &s;pirit was much pained with a &s;en&s;e of prevail|ing indifference and lukewarmne&s;s, in this day of ea&s;e and outward plenty. On &s;eventh-day, the 5th of the 8th month, I got to London, and &s;taid their meetings on fir&s;t-day. After which I returned home, and found my dear wife and family well, to our mutual comfort; being thankful to the kind hand of providence, who&s;e goodne&s;s attends tho&s;e who tru&s;t in him, both in

heights and depths; taking care of their bodies, &s;ouls, and tho&s;e outward benefits he hath bountifully favoured them with; af|fording real comfort therein, with his ble&s;|&s;ing, which maketh truly rich, and adds no &s;orrow with it. I was out this journey about eight weeks, and travelled about 740 miles, having been at about forty meetings.</P>
<P>I have pre&s;erved very little or no account of &s;hort journies and &s;ervice in this and the adjacent counties; in which, however, I was divers times engaged to labour, both at quarterly and other meetings, for the re|viving ancient zeal and diligence. But, alas! the inordinate love of worldly enjoyments, good in them&s;elves, covers the minds of many profe&s;&s;ors, like thick clay, who are exceeding hard to be made &s;en&s;ible of the chiefe&s;t good, &s;o that I have often feared &s;ome of them will not hear, until the Lord is provoked to &s;peak, with a louder voice, in judgment, which they will not be able to turn a&s;ide from, or any way to &s;hun. Many in our &s;ociety, as in others, having departed from the life, re&s;t &s;atisfied in a profe&s;&s;ion of religion: &s;ome al&s;o have de|parted from the power and form too, in a great degree; neither appearing one thing nor another, Could they &s;ee them&s;elves as judicious per&s;ons &s;ee them, &s;hame and confu&s;ion of face would cover them.</P>
<P>The next con&s;iderable journey I have any account of, was entered upon the 27th of
<PB N="230" REF="016793_0235_0F9E68CE641C6A50">
the 8th month, 1753, in order to vi&s;it friends in &s;ome parts of York&s;hire, Lanca|&s;hire, We&s;tmoreland, &amp;c. I met &s;ome friends at Walden, who with my&s;elf were appointed by the quarterly-meeting to vi&s;it that monthly meeting for their help. I was largely opened in the meeting of wor|&s;hip, to &s;et forth the beauty, order, and excellent harmony of the &s;everal members in the church of Chri&s;t; and truth had con&s;iderable dominion therein, to our great comfort, as it prepared our &s;pirits for clo&s;e and painful labour with wrong &s;pirits in the meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s, who had the boldne&s;s to plead the payment of tythes to be ju&s;|tifiable, becau&s;e required by the laws of the land; not con&s;idering the gro&s;s ab&s;ur|dity of making human laws to be preferred before the laws of Chri&s;t, however contrary thereto, and enjoined as an ab&s;olute rule for Chri&s;tians; unle&s;s they &s;uppo&s;e it impo&s;&s;i|ble that any human laws can be made con|trary to Chri&s;t's laws, which is equally ab&s;urd; as well as that &s;uch an opinion tends to invali|date the great &s;ufferings, and martyrdom of all tho&s;e, who gave up every thing they had in this world, and even their lives, rather than actively comply with the laws of the land, when they believed them incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of Chri&s;tianity, and therefore a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of God's law. But the ground of that mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, which &s;uch rea&s;on|ers fall into, appears to be upon a pre|&s;umption,
<PB N="231" REF="016793_0236_0F9E68CFAB90E888">
that the &s;ource of property is in the law, viz. that the laws of the land can alienate the right of one, without ren|dering him any equivalent, and give it to another, who had no right therein before: whereas right and wrong are immutable, and cannot be altered by human laws, which only grant people aid to pre&s;erve and recover that which of right appears to belong to them; &s;o that human laws cannot bind the con&s;ciences, any further than they are con&s;i&s;tent with the laws of God. When a &s;incere Chri&s;tian is per&s;uaded they enjoin any thing contrary to the perfect law of liberty in his own mind, he may not ac|tively re&s;i&s;t, but pa&s;&s;ively &s;uffer the penalty thereof, whereby he faithfully bears his te&s;timony again&s;t the iniquity of &s;uch a law, and &s;o far contributes to have it removed. Now paying tythes under the go&s;pel, being an antichri&s;tian, popi&s;h error, the laws enjoining their payment being grounded upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that they are due to God and holy church; how then can any clearly enlightened per&s;on pay them in any &s;hape, as he thereby a&s;&s;ents to that great error, and contributes to &s;upport it, to the great &s;candal and abu&s;e of the Chri&s;|tian religion, and that noble, free, di&s;in|tere&s;ted mini&s;try, in&s;tituted by our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who&s;e direction in that ca&s;e is,
<Q>Freely ye have received, freely give?</Q>
Much more might be &s;aid
<PB N="232" REF="016793_0237_0F9E68CFE76933F0">
to manife&s;t the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch a plea for the payment of tythes; but that I would not be tedious, hoping there are not many among&s;t us &s;o blinded by the God of this world, as to adopt &s;uch an argument. Truth prevailed in the meeting, and the te&s;timony thereof was exalted over all &s;uch &s;pirits. Prai&s;es to our God for his gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tance, mercifully afforded to all tho&s;e who put their tru&s;t in him alone! I pro|ceeded on my journey, and had meetings at Godmanche&s;ter, Oakham, and Leice&s;ter; I had clo&s;e &s;earching labour, in order that carele&s;s, lukewarm profe&s;&s;ors might be &s;tir|red up, and awakened to a &s;en&s;e of their &s;tates. The te&s;timony of truth al&s;o, flow|ing forth at times, as a refre&s;hing &s;tream of encouragement to the mourners in Sion, and &s;incere travellers thitherwards. From thence I went to Nottingham, and had a meeting; the Lord graciou&s;ly favouring with wi&s;dom and utterance, to divide the word aright to the &s;everal &s;tates of tho&s;e pre&s;ent. Truth greatly prevailed, over&s;ha|dowing the meeting to the rejoicing of many hearts. Next day I had a &s;mall meeting at Furne&s;s in Derby&s;hire, wherein I had clo&s;e labour with indolent profe&s;&s;ors, who, neglecting their own proper bu&s;ine&s;s, were too much depending upon the labours of others, to their great lo&s;s, as well as, that &s;uch unwarrantable dependance greatly tend|ed to load and depre&s;s the life in tho&s;e con|cerned,
<PB N="233" REF="016793_0238_0F9E68D16451A350">
making their exerci&s;es much the greater. The next meeting I had was at Matlock, which was large; the greate&s;t part were people of other per&s;ua&s;ions; it was, through the ble&s;&s;ed efficacy of the word of life, an open good time, and the doctrines of truth were largely declared; &s;hewing, that the world by wi&s;dom knows not God, as well as how and to whom he is plea&s;ed to make him&s;elf known. The meeting was generally pretty much affected with the virtue of truth, which was emi|nently extended that day, and I hope would not be ea&s;ily forgot by many. I went from thence to Sheffield, and attended their meet|ings on fir&s;t-day, which were large. In the morning my &s;pirit was deeply baptized into painful &s;en&s;e of the empty formal &s;tate of &s;ome, as al&s;o the undue liberties of many others. I was made willing and re&s;igned to go down into &s;ufferings on their ac|count; that if it plea&s;ed the Lord, I might be the better qualified to admini&s;ter effectually to their &s;everal &s;tates, as experi|ence hath taught me repeatedly, that I could not &s;peak feelingly to mankind for their help and recovery, any other way. At the afternoon meeting I was largely concerned to lay their &s;everal &s;tates open before them; it was a ble&s;&s;ed and &s;ea&s;onable opportunity, tending much to their awakening to a &s;en&s;e of duty, and I think it may, with thank|fulne&s;s, be &s;aid, truth was over all. The
<PB N="234" REF="016793_0239_0F9E68D239BC0F50">
next meeting I had was at Highflats, which was large, there being a numerous body of plain friends, as to the outward appear|ance, belonging thereunto. It was a labo|rious meeting, but through divine favour, there was &s;trength afforded, to lay before them in a clo&s;e pre&s;&s;ing manner, the great danger of re&s;ting contented in a decent form of religion without the life and power thereof. I hope it was a profitable time to many. I went from thence to Brighou&s;e meeting, wherein matter and utterance were given, tending to rou&s;e the indolent, and to encourage the truly concerned for truth's pro&s;perity. The next meeting was at Rau|den, which was very large and open, and the te&s;timony of truth had great dominion. I had a pretty open meeting next day at Bradford; after which I went to vi&s;it a friend who was very low and weak in body, few expecting her recovery. I felt the pure virtue of the holy anointing with her, and had it given me to &s;ignify, that I did believe the Lord would rai&s;e her up for further &s;ervice, which accordingly came to pa&s;s. I went from thence to Leeds, and attended their meetings on fir&s;t-day. In the forenoon the te&s;timony of truth was greatly exalted, in &s;etting forth the power and efficacy of living faith: it was a glori|ous time, truth being over all. In the afternoon, it was thought &s;everal hundreds attended, mo&s;tly of the people called metho|di&s;ts.
<PB N="235" REF="016793_0240_0F9E68D2E2E44FE0">
I was quite &s;hut up as to mini&s;try, I thought, in order to &s;et an example of the important duty of &s;ilence to friends and others. The meeting concluded with an awful &s;olemnity, which I hope was profit|able to many. I went from thence to Skip|ton, where the meeting was large, and the power of God's eternal truth went forth in a &s;earching awakening te&s;timony, as well as in a refre&s;hing &s;tream of con&s;olation to tho&s;e who &s;tood in need of encouragement in their travels towards the city of God. I hope it was a profitable time to many. I had a &s;mall meeting next day at Airton; it was a heavy painful time of &s;ilence in the fore part; but the Lord was plea&s;ed to ap|pear, and afford ability to &s;earch &s;ome bar|ren profe&s;&s;ors, by opening their &s;tates to them, with which they &s;eemed &s;omewhat affected; but alas! how hard it is to reach effectually unto tho&s;e who are &s;ettled as upon their lees, living in a &s;tate of mind that can re&s;t &s;ati&s;fied in an empty profe&s;&s;ion. Next day I had a pretty large meeting at Settle: there I found the life of religion much depre&s;&s;ed with an earthly formal &s;pirit; but through divine goodne&s;s, truth aro&s;e and prevailed over it for the pre&s;ent, and was exalted, as being the one thing needful. I went from thence to Lother&s;|dale, where I had a very large meeting; the Lord enabling me, otherwi&s;e a poor helple&s;s creature, to bear a thorough te&s;ti|mony,
<PB N="236" REF="016793_0241_0F9E68D644C8B370">
&s;uited to the various &s;tates of tho&s;e pre&s;ent; and his glorious name was exalted above every name. From thence I went to the hou&s;e of my beloved friends Jonathan and Margaret Raine, at Trawden; whom, for their tender regard to me when I want|ed &s;uccour both for body and mind, I have heretofore, more than once, had occa&s;ion to make mention of; as likewi&s;e of the Ecroyd's family. We greatly rejoiced in the opportunity of one another's company once more; truth having nearly united us in our former acquaintance. I &s;taid there|about &s;omething more than a week, attend|ing &s;everal meetings there and at Mar&s;den Height; wherein, e&s;pecially at &s;ome of them, the Lord was eminently with us, opening the wells of &s;alvation, that we might drink together, and &s;ing prai&s;es to him the fountain of all good. I had great openne&s;s in my &s;ervice among&s;t them; and we took our leave of one another in a &s;weet &s;en&s;e of God's love uniting our hearts one to another. On &s;econd-day, the fir&s;t of the 10th month, I &s;et out for Lanca&s;ter, in order to be at their quarterly-meeting, being accompanied by my friend Jonathan Raine. I was at their monthly-meeting there on third-day, where I had &s;ome con|&s;iderable &s;ervice. Fourth-day in the morn|ing was held their meeting of mini&s;ters and elders; which was to comfort and edifica|tion. I found my&s;elf concerned to &s;et forth
<PB N="237" REF="016793_0242_0F9E68D81A030AD8">
the nature of true go&s;pel mini&s;try; as al&s;o, to point out &s;ome dangers which might, without a &s;teady care and watchfulne&s;s, at|tend tho&s;e exerci&s;ed therein. It was, I hope, a profitable opportunity to &s;ome pre|&s;ent. The &s;ame day was held the quarter|ly-meeting, wherein the Lord was graci|ou&s;ly plea&s;ed, according to his wonted good|ne&s;s, to appear for the help of his &s;incerely concerned labourers; as, ble&s;&s;ed be his wor|thy name, he is found of tho&s;e that truly &s;eek him, and doth not fail tho&s;e who lean upon him, and not to their own under|&s;tanding, nor to former experience of his a&s;&s;i&s;ting power and wi&s;dom. Truth was great|ly in dominion and friends much edified, the unity of the one &s;pirit being livingly en|joyed. I went next day, accompanied by Samuel Fothergill, William Backhou&s;e, and William Dilworth, to the quarterly-meeting at Kendal. The &s;elect meeting for mini&s;ters and elders was held that afternoon; I had &s;ome good open &s;ervice therein, on the nature of go&s;pel mini&s;try, and the my&s;teri|ous workings of Satan in his transforma|tions. It was a time of edification and comfort. Next day was held the quarterly-meeting; in the fore part for wor&s;hip, and after for the di&s;cipline of the church, where|in I had &s;ome &s;ervice. Things were but low: we had a large meeting in the even|ing, both of friends and others; it was, through the pure efficacy of divine virtue, a ble&s;&s;ed opportunity. I was largely open|ed
<PB N="238" REF="016793_0243_0F9E68D952FBF470">
in te&s;timony concerning Chri&s;t, the di|vine light, which enlightens every man coming into the world. It ended in &s;olemn prayer and prai&s;es to almighty God; our friend Samuel Fothergill being engaged therein, in a very powerful and affecting manner. I &s;taid at Kendal, to attend their fir&s;t-day meetings; at both which, e&s;pecial|ly the latter, I was very largely opened to declare the truth with power, which affected and tendered many hearts, there being a great number of friends, mo&s;tly of a younger &s;ort, in that meeting; it hav|ing been &s;tripped, like many other places of late, of divers &s;ub&s;tantial elders. My labour was very earne&s;t, that the ri&s;ing youth might come rightly under the yoke of Chri&s;t, that they might be really pre|pared and fitted to &s;ucceed tho&s;e who are removed hence, having fini&s;hed their day's work. I went from thence, accompanied by &s;everal friends, and had a meeting at Grayrigg, to good &s;atisfaction. The te&s;ti|mony of truth went forth with clearne&s;s and good demon&s;tration, tending to awaken the carele&s;s, as well as to &s;trengthen and encourage the hone&s;t-hearted. I returned to Kendal, and went next day, accompa|nied by many friends, to a general meeting at Windermoor. The Lord's ble&s;&s;ed power was livingly felt in that meeting, whereby I was enabled, from the expre&s;&s;ions of our Lord to Nicodemus, to &s;hew the nece&s;|&s;ity
<PB N="239" REF="016793_0244_0F9E68D9A35C5A58">
of regeneration or the new birth; a doctrine highly nece&s;&s;ary to be pre&s;&s;ingly recommended to the youth in our &s;ociety, and carefully weighed by them, le&s;t any &s;hould vainly hope for an entrance into the kingdom of God, by &s;ucceeding their ance&s;|tors in the profe&s;&s;ion and confe&s;&s;ion of the truth. A lamentable error! many I fear have fallen into, imagining they are God's people, without his nature being brought forth in them; or, as &s;aith the apo&s;tle, being made partakers of the divine nature, and e&s;caping the corruptions that are in the world through lu&s;t. Great opportunity have &s;uch, by education, the writings of our predece&s;&s;ors, and al&s;o by the go&s;pel mini&s;try the Lord hath been plea&s;ed to ble&s;s our &s;ociety withal, to collect and trea&s;ure up a great deal of knowledge in the &s;pecu|lative under&s;tanding part, even to profe&s;s and confe&s;s the truth in the &s;ame words or language made u&s;e of, by tho&s;e who really learned it in the &s;chool of Chri&s;t. This is no more than an image or picture of the thing it&s;elf, without life or &s;avour; there|fore an abomination to the living God, and his quickened people. I have touched the more clo&s;ely on this head, being apprehen|&s;ive the danger is very great, which the ri|&s;ing youth are expo&s;ed to, by dwelling &s;e|curely and at ea&s;e, as it were, in hou&s;es they have not built, and enjoying vineyards they never planted; for great are their ad|vantages
<PB N="240" REF="016793_0245_0F9E68DAC05B04C8">
above others, if rightly improved; otherwi&s;e, this mu&s;t increa&s;e the weight of their condemnation. I have divers times looked upon the mournful condition of tho&s;e who tru&s;t, as above hinted, in the religion of their education, to be aptly &s;et forth in the holy &s;criptures, by an hungry man dreaming that he eateth, and behold, when he awaketh, his &s;oul is empty. Oh, that all may deeply and carefully ponder in their hearts, what they have known in deed and in truth, of the new birth, with the &s;ore labour and pangs thereof! I cannot conceive, if they are &s;erious and con&s;ider the import|ance of the ca&s;e, but they will &s;oon di&s;co|ver how it is with them in this re&s;pect, by ob&s;erving which way their minds are bent and thoughts employed, whether towards earthly or heavenly things. Tho&s;e who are born from above, or ri&s;en with Chri&s;t, which is the &s;ame thing, it is natural for them to &s;eek tho&s;e things which are above; their affections being fixed thereon. So, on the other hand, that which is born of the fle&s;h is but fle&s;h, and can ri&s;e no high|er than what appertains to this tran&s;itory world; for fle&s;h and blood cannot inherit God's kingdom; and it is &s;aid, tho&s;e who are in the fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e God. The apo&s;tolick advice therefore, is to walk in the &s;pirit; that is, let the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t be your guide and director, how to order your lives and conver&s;ation in all things; for the
<PB N="241" REF="016793_0246_0F9E68DB25C864D0">
children of God are led by his &s;pirit. I hope to be excu&s;ed in dwelling a little on this &s;ubject, having often greatly feared, that the de&s;cendants of the Lord's wor|thies who were full of faith and good works, &s;hould take their re&s;t in the out|&s;ide of things, valuing them&s;elves on being the offspring of &s;uch: a &s;orrowful mi&s;take which the Jews fell into! May all duly con&s;ider, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to be the children of Abraham, unle&s;s they do the works of Abraham.</P>
<P>Truth was greatly in dominion that day, and many hearts were much tendered and contrited before the Lord; to whom be everla&s;ting prai&s;es, Amen! The next meeting was at the Height, where I had clo&s;e rou&s;ing &s;ervice, in order to awaken carele&s;s formal profe&s;&s;ors. The day follow|ing I had a large meeting at Coltis, near Hawk&s;head; where I was favoured with great openne&s;s upon the nature of true faith, and that it mu&s;t be evidenced by good works; for faith, when only an a&s;&s;ent or con&s;ent of the mind to principles of reli|gion true in them&s;elves, being alone, is dead, as a body is without the &s;pirit. The power of truth had great dominion, it being a time not ea&s;ily to be forgot. The next day I had a meeting at Swarthmoor; there al&s;o I was led to &s;peak largely of faith, viz. of hi&s;torical faith, implicit faith, and to &s;et forth the nature of that faith
<PB N="242" REF="016793_0247_0F9E68DBE59AD8A8">
which was once delivered to the &s;aints; being their victory over the world and all the corruptions thereof. It works by love, to the purifying of the heart, and when the heart is made pure, we can thereby &s;ee God.
<Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in heart, &s;aid Chri&s;t, for they &s;hall &s;ee God.</Q>
And his apo&s;tle &s;aid,
<Q>By faith we come to &s;ee him that is invi&s;ible.</Q>
It is plain from the holy &s;cripture, that it pro|ceeds from a divine principle in man; for it is the evidence of things not &s;een, and the &s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for. No man can po&s;&s;ibly plea&s;e God without it. O that mankind would carefully examine them|&s;elves, whether or no they be in this faith! If they be in it, they cannot be &s;trangers to Chri&s;t, inwardly revealed; for he dwells in the hearts of true believers by faith; his kingdom being within, where all his laws and ordinances are di&s;covered, clearly under&s;tood, and willingly obeyed. No complaint, when this faith is received and held in a pure con&s;cience, of hard things being required, or his commandments being grievous; but a &s;oul endued with this powerful principle, can &s;ay with &s;incerity, the Lord's ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and his paths are paths of peace. It was a good time, and I hope profitable to many. The next meeting I had was at Pre&s;ton, near Kendal; there I was earne&s;t|ly concerned to &s;tir up friends to more
<PB N="243" REF="016793_0248_0F9E68DCAE278188">
faithfulne&s;s and a clo&s;er union one with another. It was a laborious time, but the ble&s;&s;ed truth prevailed and carried through, to mine own ea&s;e in a good degree. I went from thence to Briggflats, near Sed|burg. The meeting was large, and for &s;ome time heavy and afflicting; but it plea&s;ed the great Ma&s;ter of our a&s;&s;emblies to ari&s;e, with|out who&s;e gracious help his poor in&s;tru|ments can do nothing to any good pur|po&s;e. It was a &s;olemn awakening time; I hope to be remembered by many. I had a meeting next day at Raven&s;tondale, which was a laborious trying time: my way was &s;hut up as to mini&s;try; friends &s;eemed too much at ea&s;e in a profe&s;&s;ion. When this is the ca&s;e, the life of religion is exceedingly de|pre&s;&s;ed; &s;o that tho&s;e who feel its &s;tate, mu&s;t &s;uffer therewith, until it plea&s;e the Lord to rai&s;e his pure &s;eed, in judgment again&s;t evil in people's minds: then man falls under for the pre&s;ent, and confe&s;&s;es to that name or power given under heaven for his &s;alvation. But alas! he &s;oon denies it again, by giving way to a contrary power; an enemy to God and his own &s;oul. In &s;uch ups and downs, changes and conflicts, by the working of contrary powers in their minds, many weary out their days in vain, becau&s;e they will not re&s;olve to choo&s;e the good, and to e&s;chew the evil, that they might be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the rock of ages for ever. The next day&punc; I had another meet|ing
<PB N="244" REF="016793_0249_0F9E68DD65B394B0">
at Pre&s;ton; it was a time of clo&s;e la|bour, yet through gracious help, I hope it was a &s;erviceable meeting. I went from thence to Yeoland; this was a &s;uffering time, much of the te&s;timony given me then to bear, went forth &s;harp again&s;t &s;uch who were &s;trong and confident in profe&s;&s;ion, without real experience of the living vir|tue and holy efficacy of God's eternal truth, to quicken and &s;ea&s;on their &s;pirits. We find it very hard to gain any entrance on &s;uch. The te&s;timony is often felt to rebound, which in low times is a great di&s;|couragement to the poor in&s;trument. Here the faith and patience of the go&s;pel mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed. I under&s;tood after meeting, that the &s;tate of &s;ome pre&s;ent had been re|markably &s;poken to that day, which tended to humble my mind in thankfulne&s;s before the Lord, for his gracious help and guid|ance. After the&s;e exerci&s;ing painful times, doubts are apt to enter, and fears to po&s;&s;e&s;s the mind, le&s;t we have been mi&s;taken in what we apprehend the Lord required of us to deliver. (I &s;ay us, as I do not doubt but it has been the experience of many others, as well as mine.) This ought to be carefully guarded again&s;t, le&s;t the poor in&s;trument &s;ink thereby, below its &s;ervice, by giving away its &s;trength and &s;ure de|fence. The &s;oul's armour and weapons being thus imprudently given away or ca&s;t off, our &s;pirits are weaker than tho&s;e of
<PB N="245" REF="016793_0250_0F9E68DE2CC72668">
others, and con&s;equently fall under them. Here that dominion, in which there is abi|lity to teach, may be lo&s;t. There is great danger al&s;o, on the other hand, of being too confident and &s;ecure, as I have ob&s;erved &s;ome, after they have darkened coun&s;el by a multitude of words without right know|ledge, and exceedingly burdened the liv|ing, appear quite chearful and full of &s;a|tisfaction, &s;eeming as if thoroughly plea&s;ed them&s;elves: which is a lamentable blind|ne&s;s, and di&s;covers them to be at a great di&s;tance from the dictates and holy impre&s;|&s;ions of truth. This is what all ought earne&s;tly to pray they may be pre&s;erved from, walking carefully in the middle path, retaining a jealou&s;y over them&s;elves, with a &s;ingle eye to God's honour, and the pro|motion of his truth. Then will their feet be &s;hod with the preparation of the go&s;pel of peace, and will appear beautiful as upon the mountains. I went from Yeoland to Lanca&s;ter, and attended their meetings on fir&s;t-day, where I had good open &s;ervice, truth being comfortably in dominion, and friends thereby nearly united one to ano|ther. From Lanca&s;ter I went to the fol|lowing meetings, Filde, Frekle&s;ton, Pre&s;|ton, Langtree, and A&s;hton. They were generally &s;mall, and the life of religion at a very low ebb. I was favoured with &s;trength to di&s;charge the &s;ervice required, in a clo&s;e painful labour for their help and
<PB N="246" REF="016793_0251_0F9E68DEE2AEC0F0">
recovery. But alas! great is the declen&s;ion in tho&s;e parts, and I fear but little laid to heart. The next meeting I went to was at Hart&s;haw, being a general meeting, which was very large, and although &s;ome|thing heavy and painful in the fore part, yet, through divine goodne&s;s, it proved a &s;olemn &s;erviceable meeting, and by &s;trength and wi&s;dom received from above, divers weighty go&s;pel truths were delivered, to the comfort and edification of many. I had that evening a large meeting at War|rington; but, as heretofore in the &s;ame place, I felt their life and dependance was too much upon and after declarations. I found it my duty to di&s;appoint that &s;pirit, by &s;itting the whole time in &s;ilence. I went from thence to my valuable friends John and Jo&s;hua Toft's, near Leek in Stafford|&s;hire, having Samuel Fothergill for com|pany and guide. I had a &s;erviceable meet|ing at Leek; my labour was clo&s;e in plain dealing with &s;ome, who appeared to me too much exalted in their own wi&s;dom and conceit of them&s;elves, whereby the &s;implicity of the truth was too much over|looked by them. On fifth-day, the 1&s;t of the 11th month, being accompanied by Jo&s;hua Toft, I went to Stafford, and had a &s;mall poor meeting there. Next day in the evening we had a meeting at Tamworth, which was large, being chiefly made up with the con&s;iderable inhabitants of the
<PB N="247" REF="016793_0252_0F9E68E2C238E8A0">
town. The public &s;ervice thereof fell upon my companion, with which I was well plea&s;ed, but found my mind not clear of friends belonging to that meeting, and therefore de&s;ired to have a meeting with them next day, at a friend's hou&s;e, as I was de&s;irous to have friends only. I had clo&s;e &s;earching &s;ervice among&s;t them, yet to my comfort and great relief in the end. On fir&s;t-day, the 4th, I was at Birmingham meetings; the forenoon was a good open time, wherein the te&s;timony of truth was exalted; but the afternoon proved a heavy painful meeting; my way was quite &s;hut up as to mini&s;try. Now apprehending my&s;elf di&s;charged from further &s;ervice in this journey, on &s;econd-day morning I &s;et my face homewards, and got to Northamp|ton that night, and next day to Hitchin, and got home on fourth-day, the 7th of the 11th month, finding my dear wife and fa|mily well; being thankful, as we had great cau&s;e, to the fountain of all our mercies, for his providential care over us, when outwardly &s;eparated for his &s;ervice &s;ake. I was from home this journey, about ten weeks and three days, in which time I travel|led, by account, about 760 miles, and was at about fifty-five meetings. In the year 1754, I travelled with my e&s;teemed friend John Churchman, through Hamp&s;hire, the I&s;le of Wight, and part of Surry; the parti|culars whereof I cannot at pre&s;ent find;
<PB N="248" REF="016793_0253_0F9E68E3D9C4D128">
but I remember it was the la&s;t of his travels in this nation, and that we were nearly united in the &s;ervice; the power and wi&s;|dom of truth being livingly and comfort|ably with us, enabling us to labour with diligence for the promotion of truth, and our own peace. In the fore part of the year 1756, being in company with my e&s;teemed friend Peter Andrews from America, &s;ometimes vi&s;iting meetings in the city of London, I was &s;eized with a violent di&s;order; it was with con&s;iderable difficulty I got home, and &s;oon took my chamber, where I continued many weeks under great afflic|tion of body, and al&s;o of mind at times, which I have divers times experienced as a further trial of my faith and patience. The Lord has been plea&s;ed to withdraw his comforting enlivening pre&s;ence; I have thought rather more &s;o in tho&s;e times of bodily afflictions, than others; for wi&s;e ends, be&s;t known to him&s;elf. Oh! who can under&s;tand or conceive the anxiety of the mind when this is the ca&s;e, except tho&s;e who have felt the &s;ame? But, through divine favour, it was not &s;o with me always, e&s;pecially in the la&s;t of my great illne&s;&s;es, which was the latter end of 1758, when the joys of heaven &s;o opened upon my &s;oul, as I had never known before, which made me willing to hope that I was near entering into the full fruition thereof. How &s;trong were my de&s;ires then to be di&s;&s;olved, and to be
<PB N="249" REF="016793_0254_0F9E68E5AD666020">
with Chri&s;t for ever! Ready to &s;ay, now let thy &s;ervant depart in peace&punc; for mine eyes have &s;een thy &s;alvation! but I was not then accepted herein, neither was my mind after|wards free from &s;ome fears and doubts, that I had offended a gracious God, by an over-anxious de&s;ire to be removed from a mili|tant to a triumphant &s;tate. The example of our Lord (though he was the only be|gotton Son) in addre&s;&s;ing the Father, is highly worthy to be ever remembered by us, in all our de&s;ires and prayers, viz.
<Q>Neverthele&s;s, not my will, but thine be done!</Q>
The above hints may fall into the hands of &s;ome poor afflicted per&s;ons, to whom they may afford comfort, by ob&s;erv|ing, they are not quite &s;ingular in their trials, and from thence, through the divine ble&s;&s;ings, receive &s;ome encouragement: which is my rea&s;on for penning them, as well as many other remarks in the cour&s;e of this journal; even on my mo&s;t inward and hid|den trials. I have had great cau&s;e to ble&s;s and prai&s;e the Lord, many times &s;ince, when I have ob&s;erved the great advantage of tho&s;e very pinching &s;ea&s;ons of affliction, how much they tend to refine, and to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the &s;oul upon the rock of ages, yielding the peaceable fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s to tho&s;e who are properly exerci&s;ed thereby. I had very little health from the time that I was taken before-mentioned, for about two years; yet was enabled, in 1757, to vi&s;it
<PB N="250" REF="016793_0255_0F9E68E66580C4E0">
friends meetings in Kent, Su&s;&s;ex, and &s;ome few meetings in Hamp&s;hire, &amp;c. I &s;et out from home the 12th of the 7th month, and cro&s;&s;ed the River Thames at Grave&s;end, where by appointment I met my friend Jo&s;eph Taylor, and with him Jo&s;eph Wood, and Stephen Jack&s;on, all from London. We went that afternoon to Roche&s;ter, where about &s;ix in the evening we had a meeting, there being a meeting-hou&s;e; though I think but one per&s;on (then) a young woman, who made profe&s;&s;ion with us. Many others came, and there was an openne&s;s to declare the doctrines of truth largely among&s;t them, which I hope was not altogether in vain. From thence we all went to Canterbury, except Stephen Jack&s;on, who returned home. We had a meeting there, made up chiefly of profe&s;&s;ors with us. The te&s;ti|mony of truth went forth in a clo&s;e &s;earch|ing manner, and, through mercy, it was exalted over all of a contrary nature. The Lord had the prai&s;e, and his &s;incere follow|ers &s;atisfaction and comfort. We had a meeting next at a place called Burching|ton, where there was a meeting-hou&s;e, but none of our &s;ociety living in that place; the people filled the hou&s;e, and a pretty many out of doors; they appeared, in gene|ral, a low ignorant people; yet the Lord, with whom there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons, opened the doctrines of the go&s;pel largely, and in a reaching affecting manner, by
<PB N="251" REF="016793_0256_0F9E68E7239A8C38">
which many &s;eemed to be tendered. Next day we had a meeting at Drapers, near Margate, which was &s;mall, and things low as to the life of religion. In a very &s;mall meeting in the evening at Deal, I had &s;ome clo&s;e &s;ervice; after which, one per&s;on gave me &s;ufficient cau&s;e to &s;ee there was need of it. The next meeting was at Dover, being on &s;eventh-day in the evening, as I was de&s;irous of being at Folk|&s;tone on the day following. Truth opened doctrine and coun&s;el for their help and edification, there being &s;ome lately convin|ced of our principles, who appeared tender and hopeful. I had good &s;atisfaction among&s;t the few friends in that place. At Folk&s;tone the meetings were large, but the life of religion mournfully low and borne down, not only with tho&s;e things com|monly called undue liberties in many, but al&s;o, with the form of religion, without the power of it in others. I had (as it were) a thre&s;hing in&s;trument put into mine hands, and was enabled to di&s;charge the &s;ervice re|quired, to my great ea&s;e and relief; for my &s;pirit was exceedingly loaded and bowed down at that place. Oh! what pity it is, that old profe&s;&s;ors, in&s;tead of being as pil|lars in the hou&s;e of God, and as Aarons and Hurs, bearing part of the Lord's great work (&s;o happily and gloriou&s;ly begun in the earth) &s;hould be a means of ob&s;tructing the &s;ame, and by the carnality of their

&s;pirits, burden and greatly depre&s;s the word of life in the me&s;&s;engers of Chri&s;t, &s;ent in order to carry it on among&s;t mankind: thereby rendering them&s;elves altogether un|worthy to be named by his name, to ta&s;te of his dainties, or to live under this latter, and as glorious a manife&s;tation of evangeli|cal light and truth, as was ever extended to mankind! Is not the great de&s;ign of the Almighty obvious, in gathering us as a people into his fold, to &s;it under his teach|ings, and con&s;equently under his glorious manife&s;tation, &s;howering upon us great plenty of rain from above, and heavenly dew as upon Hermon's hills, viz. that we might be as the garden of the Lord, full of fruitful plants and fragrant flowers, &s;end|ing forth a &s;weet &s;mell, yea, to be as a fountain of gardens, and wells of living water, and &s;treams from the goodly beauti|ful mountains of Lebanon: for it is writ|ten,
<Q>Out of the belly of him that be|lieves, &s;hall flow rivers of living water.</Q>
By which it plainly appears, that the Lord's cho&s;en people are like conduits, channels, or water-&s;pouts, to convey the water of life into the wilderne&s;s, that it may be|come a fruitful field, and that the de&s;art land may come to rejoice, and blo&s;&s;om as a ro&s;e; al&s;o into the &s;ea, viz. among&s;t the nations, languages, tongues and people <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ezekiel xlvii.</NOTE>,

to heal the fi&s;hes that are in this &s;ea, viz. the back&s;liders and di&s;tempered of mankind. But oh, how &s;lowly doth this work go on! And what a little progre&s;s it hath yet made, to what was expected by tho&s;e valiants, who fir&s;t engaged again&s;t Babylon in the morn|ing of our day, and made that kingdom &s;hake! But many under the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion in this day, are turned again&s;t the truth, and at the &s;ame time they pretend to main|tain its cau&s;e, they are &s;upporting and &s;trengthening the kingdom of Babylon all in their power, which is exceeding &s;trange to think, and perhaps would not be believed by hundreds that really are doing it. The rea&s;on is, they fir&s;t of all have taken &s;ome draughts of the wine, out of the whore of Babylon's golden cup, whereby they are &s;o intoxicated, as not to know what they are doing; &s;o that, when they think they are &s;erving God, they are &s;erving Satan. Were not the Jews drunk with this cup, when they dreamed that God was their fa|ther, and at the &s;ame time were in reality of their father the Devil, doing his works, when they thought they were doing God's works? This woeful mi&s;take has been, and is almo&s;t general among&s;t mankind. When they &s;uppre&s;s the mea&s;ure of grace in them|&s;elves, and drink a few draughts as above-&s;aid, they are then fit to follow antichri&s;t whither&s;oever he will lead them; but he will take care, not to have much cro&s;s to

At this they have &s;tumbled; and although little &s;en&s;e is at pre&s;ent retained thereof, by rea&s;on of the intoxication before mentioned, yet when they are &s;ummoned before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t, and the books come to be opened, all will then &s;ee things as they really are, which do not at all change their natures, though, by a de|fect in the capacity before de&s;cribed they be not &s;een or under&s;tood.</P>
<P>It is worthy to be remembered, and deep|ly pondered by great numbers in our &s;ociety, that it was the rebellion and unfaithfulne&s;s of the children of I&s;rael, that was the cau&s;e of their being turned back again into a barren, doleful, howling wilderne&s;s, when near the borders of the land of promi&s;e. They doubtle&s;s might have then entered, &s;ubdued the idolatrous inhabitants, and taken full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, had they believed in and obeyed that mighty Jehovah, who with an out&s;tretched arm had brought them out of the land of Egypt, dividing the Red Sea in mercy to them, and for the de&s;truction of their enemies. But oh! what a long wilderne&s;s they had afterwards, for about

the &s;pace of thirty-eight years, until all that people had fallen, except Caleb and Jo&s;hua, men of upright hearts, whom the Lord honoured with being the leaders of an entire new people to po&s;&s;e&s;s the land. Cannot the empty formal profe&s;&s;ors among&s;t us, who, under great preten&s;ions, have &s;uf|fered a heart of unbelief, a rebellious heart, that has departed from the living God, and embraced this pre&s;ent world, read their own condemnation in the before-mentioned ac|count? Shall they ever enter into the hea|venly Canaan? or be accounted worthy to carry on his glorious work in the earth? No, verily; but they mu&s;t fall into great condemnation, except they repent, and re|deem their mi&s;-&s;pent time, and another peo|ple be rai&s;ed to maintain this glorious cau&s;e, to whom the Caleb's and Jo&s;hua's in our &s;ociety will be as leaders and directors; like Pri&s;cillas and Aquilas, to expound unto them (who enquire the way to Sion) the way of the Lord more perfectly; for I am fully per&s;uaded, our &s;ociety will not cea&s;e to be a people, nor the glory ever depart there|from wholly, as it did from the Jewi&s;h, and in a great degree the lap&s;ed Chri&s;tian church. I have no doubt, but that a people will be pre&s;erved from generation to generation, to contend earne&s;tly for the faith once delivered to the &s;aints, and to maintain the &s;ame with the doctrine and principle re&s;ulting there|from, &s;o eminently revived in our predece&s;|&s;ors,

and mo&s;t &s;urely believed by us. So that when it &s;hall plea&s;e the Lord to awa|ken the nations, there will be no occa&s;ion to expect new di&s;coveries, or other manife&s;|tations, but the Lord will &s;hew where he feeds his flock, and where they lie down at noon. I do not expect the pre&s;ent le|thargy, and almo&s;t univer&s;al indifference of all denominations of Chri&s;tians about reli|gion, is to continue very long, for the Lord's &s;oul abhors it. I am fully per&s;uaded he will ari&s;e in dreadful maje&s;ty, to &s;hake terribly the earth; the power, wi&s;dom, po|licy, and &s;plendor thereof, and not only the earth, but the heavens al&s;o, that he may remove tho&s;e things which can be &s;haken, that tho&s;e things that cannot be &s;haken may remain. Then &s;hall people &s;ee how empty and fruitle&s;s their religious pre|ten&s;ions have been. Then will their eyes and cries be to the Lord, to &s;hew them the pa&s;ture of the flock of his companions. Then will mankind receive a kingdom which cannot be &s;haken. But, oh! the bitter cups that mu&s;t be drank, and the phials of God's wrath that mu&s;t be poured upon nations and kingdoms, before mankind in general will be humbled enough, to &s;ub|mit to the yoke of Chri&s;t, and to learn of him, who is meek and low in heart. But he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and can turn and overturn, until the inhabitants of the earth are willing that he &s;hould

<P>Great and marvellous hath been the Lord's conde&s;cen&s;ion and goodne&s;s, manife&s;ted for our help and pre&s;ervation many ways; one whereof I cannot well omit a &s;hort remark upon, viz. the reviving of ancient zeal for the promotion of di&s;cipline and good order, which I find is almo&s;t general throughout the &s;ociety, that &s;pirit of &s;ound judgment, and the burning of that holy fire, which the Lord doth kindle in the hearts of the faithful, has never been wholly extin|gui&s;hed, &s;ince we have been a people; though in &s;ome places, through the neg|lect of many, it hath burned rather faint and languid. This has of late been much augmented, and the number of tho&s;e who will not take bribes (that is, through favour and affection pervert judgment) in|crea&s;ed. I pray God, for his great name's &s;ake, and his people's pre&s;ervation, this good work may pro&s;per! Publick mini&s;try, though a great ble&s;&s;ing, help, and comfort to God's people, may be &s;hunned, evaded, and turned off by individuals: but the church cannot ea&s;ily lo&s;e ground, under a godly, impartial admini&s;tration of &s;ound judgment, and dealing in the way of good order and di&s;cipline, as this brings judg|ment home; thou art the man.

<P>I then proceeded to vi&s;it Su&s;&s;ex. The fir&s;t meeting I had in that county, was Gard|ner-Street; I could find but very few, if any, truly alive in religion there. I had hard clo&s;e work with the unfaithful, in &s;ome important branches of our Chri&s;tian te&s;ti|mony, to which I was immediately led; for I knew nothing of their &s;tate by outward information. I had meetings al&s;o at Lewes, Brighthelm&s;tone, and Arundel. At all which places, I found the life of religion much depre&s;&s;ed. My &s;ervice was clo&s;e and &s;earching; but alas! carnal profe&s;&s;ors are very hard to be made &s;en&s;ible of their de|plorable condition. From Arundel I went to Chiche&s;ter, where I had a meeting, and good open &s;ervice, not only to &s;tir up the

carele&s;s to more fervent <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">our, but al&s;o to encourage and &s;trengthen &s;ome tender-hearted travellers Zion-wards. It was, through the holy efficacy of truth, a ble&s;|&s;ed time, I went from thence to Alton, in Hamp&s;hire, and attended their fir&s;t-day meeting. There is a large body of friends, among&s;t whom, the great Ma&s;ter of our a&s;&s;emblies opened doctrine and coun&s;el, &s;uited to their &s;everal &s;tates, and the ble&s;&s;ed truth was in great dominion that day. The next meeting I had was at Godalming, where I had very clo&s;e heavy &s;ervice, being made &s;en&s;ible of much indifference and lukewarmne&s;s in &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors. It was often my lot to labour for the &s;tirring up and reviving of &s;uch: but alas! it is hard work, yet &s;ufficiently rewarded by the com|fortable returns of true peace, in a faithful di&s;charge of duty. The next meeting I had was at Staines, which was pretty open and &s;atisfactory: being livingly engaged to ad|mini&s;ter &s;uitably to the &s;everal &s;tates of tho&s;e pre&s;ent. I went from thence to Uxbridge, where I had open thorough &s;ervice, to good &s;atisfaction. After which I went to High-Wickham, and had a heavy laborious meet|ing. The &s;ame day I had an evening meet|ing at Amer&s;ham, in which I had &s;ome &s;ervice, though things were very low. Next day I had a meeting at Jordans, where the ble&s;&s;ed truth had great dominion, and the te&s;timony thereof flowed forth
<PB N="260" REF="016793_0265_0F9E68F1A2B31268">
freely, in doctrine and coun&s;el, for the help and comfort of tho&s;e pre&s;ent. After which I went to London, where I &s;taid the fir&s;t-day meetings over. I attended Grace-church-Street in the morning, where I had good &s;ervice, and the te&s;timony of truth had great dominion. I went to Devon&s;hire-Hou&s;e in the afternoon, where I had al&s;o a good open time to declare the truth; finding much ea&s;e and peace of mind. The &s;ervice of this &s;mall journey being over, I returned home the next day, having been out about four weeks, at 28 meetings, and travelled about 350 miles.</P>
<P>The next journey I have any account of, was chiefly in order to vi&s;it the quarterly-meetings of Lincoln, York, Lanca&s;ter, and Kendal. I &s;et out the 16th of the 6th month, 1758, and, by appointment, met Jo&s;eph Taylor at Cambridge, who was to be my companion as far as York. It being fir&s;t-day, we went to their meeting in the morning, which was very &s;mall, and things exceeding low as to the life of religion. We went in the afternoon about ten miles to a general-meeting at a place called Over, which was large, and I was largely opened therein, in clo&s;e awakening &s;ervice, tending to rou&s;e carele&s;s profe&s;&s;ors, of whom there &s;eemed to be many at that meeting. We proceeded after meeting as far as Erith, and next day got to Spalding, in Lincoln&s;hire, where we met our worthy
<PB N="261" REF="016793_0266_0F9E68F2639ABF00">
friend Mordecai Yarnall from America, who was then on a religious vi&s;it in this nation, and Samuel Neal from Ireland. The 20th in the morning we &s;et out for Lincoln quarterly-meeting, which began the next day about noon, and ended the day following. Truth is at a low ebb in this county, and the di&s;cipline in the main but poorly managed, and the conduct of divers profe&s;&s;ors admini&s;ters cau&s;e of offence; yet we were, through the extendings of mer|ciful goodne&s;s, favoured with con&s;iderable openne&s;s, and pretty thorough &s;ervice for their help, and to our own ea&s;e in a good degree. After this meeting was over, my companion and I proceeded on our journey towards York, taking Leed's fir&s;t-day meet|ings in our way, which were large, very heavy, and laborious. My proper bu&s;ine&s;s was to wade under a great weight, occa|&s;ioned by the indolent &s;pirits of tho&s;e who were unwilling to labour and bear their own burdens, in an example of &s;ilence. Next morning was held their monthly-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, where I had clo&s;e &s;ervice; and the &s;ame day that for di&s;cipline, which was exceeding large, our &s;ociety being very numerous thereabout. The te&s;timony of truth was greatly exalted therein, in treating concerning Chri&s;t, the everla&s;ting Rock upon which the church is built, whereupon only it can &s;tand firm, again&s;t all the attempts of a potent adver&s;ary,
<PB N="262" REF="016793_0267_0F9E68F5E5D0D8E0">
and his emi&s;&s;aries. Next day we went to York, where the &s;ame evening was held the quar|terly meeting of mini&s;ters and elders. I had &s;ome open &s;ervice therein, particularly to mini&s;ters. We were divinely favoured in the &s;ucceeding meetings, both for wor|&s;hip and di&s;cipline, to our edification and comfort. From York I went towards Ken|dal, and was, in my way, at a yearly-meeting held on a fir&s;t-day, in a large barn near Bingley; where (it was thought) were very near a thou&s;and people of other religi|ous per&s;ua&s;ions, be&s;ides many of our own &s;o|ciety. I was largely opened therein to preach the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, in the autho|rity and demon&s;tration thereof. The peo|ple generally behaved in a &s;ober becoming manner, appearing well &s;atisfied, which is too often the mo&s;t we can &s;ay in our day, concerning &s;uch memorable opportunities; whereas, our predece&s;&s;ors might have added, perhaps, that &s;everal hundreds were con|vinced. However, we mu&s;t content our|&s;elves with the &s;tate or condition of the fields of the world, in our day: and al|though we cannot lift up our eyes as they could, to behold the fields white unto har|ve&s;t, yet let there be hone&s;t endeavours to contribute all in our power, for the bring|ing them forward in this re&s;pect, and leave the re&s;t to the Lord, in who&s;e hands alone are times and &s;ea&s;ons. I had a meeting at Skipton that evening, to good &s;atisfaction.
<PB N="263" REF="016793_0268_0F9E68F7081219E0">
I went from thence to Settle, and was at their monthly-meeting, where I had good &s;ervice, and &s;o proceeded, to Kendal, ac|companied by divers friends. The &s;ame day was held the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, wherein our ancient worthy friend James Wil&s;on, had excellent &s;ervice, to our great comfort and edification. Their quar|terly-meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s was held next day, wherein I had good &s;ervice, in the opening of go&s;pel life and power. A ble&s;|&s;ed meeting it was. The Lord alone had the prai&s;e, who is for ever worthy thereof! I attended Kendal meetings the fir&s;t-day following, which were very large, and pre|cious; the everla&s;ting truth and its te&s;ti|mony, being exalted over all of a contrary nature, to the great comfort of the up|right in heart. I went, accompanied by our friend James Wil&s;on, and many others, to their general meeting at Pre&s;ton Patrick, which was very large. My &s;ervice therein was clo&s;e, &s;earching, and laborious; not only in a &s;en&s;e of great lukewarmne&s;s and indifference in &s;ome, but al&s;o the heart-burnings, di&s;union, and &s;ecret &s;mitings one again&s;t another, of others. It &s;eemed to me, that &s;pirit had &s;ubtilly prevailed on &s;ome accounted of the foremo&s;t rank, to their own hurt, and the wounding of the innocent life. My &s;pirit had been pain|fully affected with the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate of that meeting, in degree, in my
<PB N="264" REF="016793_0269_0F9E68F85E543C88">
former vi&s;its to it; but never had &s;o much power and comfortable dominion over the &s;ame, as at this time, wherein truth mightily prevailed, to the &s;ubduing, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, all that was of a contrary nature. Near the conclu&s;ion of the &s;aid meeting, our worthy ancient friend, before-mentioned, publicly te&s;tified, that the eternal truth of God was over all, exhorting friends highly to prize &s;uch ble&s;&s;ed opportunities, and carefully to improve thereby.</P>
<P>In relating what has been done, in mar|vellous kindne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion, through me a poor weak in&s;trument, towards the help and re&s;toration of my fellow-mortals, I do &s;incerely de&s;ire, if any good is done, the Lord only may have the prai&s;e, honour, and glory; for he alone is worthy, and nothing belongs to the creature, but hu|mility, reverence, obedience, and laying the mouth as in the du&s;t. I would be &s;o un|der&s;tood throughout the whole narrative, though not always expre&s;&s;ed in words.</P>
<P>I went from Kendal to Lanca&s;ter. The quarterly &s;elect meeting for mini&s;ters and elders was fir&s;t held; wherein our ancient friend James Wil&s;on, before-mentioned, bore a noble, evangelical te&s;timony, to the in&s;truction, edification, and great comfort of friends. Next day was held their quarterly-meeting for di&s;cipline, in which, through the efficacy of divine power, I had &s;ome open weighty &s;ervice. I cannot well for|bear

remarking the great &s;atisfaction and plea&s;ure I had at this meeting, in behold|ing, and having the acceptable company of three honourable, worthy, ancient friends, viz. James Wil&s;on, Lydia Lanca&s;ter, and Grace Chambers; who, I think, all bore living and powerful te&s;timonies therein, in a very affecting manner, to the holy efficacy of that everla&s;ting truth, which had been with them all their life long. Oh! it was a time of much humbling encouragement, to &s;ee their greenne&s;s and fruitfulne&s;s in old age. I looked upon them as patterns of primitive times and friends. There is &s;ome|thing wonderfully great and excellent, &s;een only by tho&s;e eyes which the Lord hath opened, in the native &s;implicity of the truth, and that e&s;tate into which it gradually brings a man, who, in a total denial of &s;elf, hath fully given up to be formed by it. This I take to have been very much the ca&s;e with friends in the beginning, which ren|dered them &s;o very obnoxious to the &s;pirit of the world; than which, there is nothing more oppo&s;ite to a redeemed &s;tate: &s;o that the more any are drawn out of the corrupt ways and &s;pirit of the world, the more they are hated by it. This is obvious, when we con&s;ider the treatment which Chri&s;t our Lord, in whom the Godhead dwelt bodily, met with. If many in profe&s;|&s;ion with us are nearer in unity and peace with the world now, than our friends were

formerly, let it not be under&s;tood as a token of their advancement in the nature and &s;pirit of true religion; but the contrary, viz. that they are fallen nearer thereunto, and become more like it in &s;pirit, though &s;omewhat different as to the exterior part of religion, which the world cares not much for, when it finds, that in the main, we are making advances towards them. Our friends formerly delivered them&s;elves in mini&s;try and writing, in a plain, &s;imple &s;tile and language, becoming the cau&s;e they were &s;incerely engaged to promote; chiefly aiming to &s;peak and write, &s;o as to convey the power and efficacy of the pure truth, to that of God in the con&s;ciences of men. It is no &s;mall glory to the righteous cau&s;e we are engaged to promote, that it has made &s;uch a mighty progre&s;s in the world, upon a better foundation than that of human helps and learned accompli&s;hments. The very fir&s;t and mo&s;t eminent in&s;truments, rai&s;ed to propagate the &s;ame, were illi|terate men, agreeable to what Paul deli|vers, 1 Cor. chap. i. ver. 26, 27, 28, and 29. May the&s;e things be weightily con|&s;idered by all tho&s;e, who &s;eem to aim at &s;eeking credit to the &s;ociety, by means of tho&s;e outward embelli&s;hments, from which our worthy ancients were wholly turned, to &s;eek and wait for that living power and holy authority, which alone is able to carry on the work of man's redemption to the

end of time: the departure from which opened the door effectually for the apo&s;tacy to over&s;pread; then human wi&s;dom and learning became, in the e&s;timation of de|generate Chri&s;tians, e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to make mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel. But the early mini&s;ters and writers in the Chri&s;|tian church, became very eminent another way, as we have great rea&s;on to believe mo&s;t of them were illiterate men; and &s;uch of them who had attained human learning, when the power of the go&s;pel was inwardly revealed, laid all &s;uch accompli&s;hments down at the feet of that power, to whom every knee mu&s;t bow, and every tongue mu&s;t confe&s;s: &s;o that we find them counting all that as dro&s;s and dung, to which men, in their corrupt wills and wi&s;dom, give the highe&s;t place for u&s;efulne&s;s, as above hint|ed. And I think, &s;ome among&s;t us fall very little &s;hort of the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition of mind, though they do not care to own it in words; for I have divers times ob|&s;erved, &s;ome have but little reli&s;h or ta&s;te for the &s;ub&s;tantial truths of the go&s;pel, in a plain &s;imple dre&s;s; nor to read books, holding forth the &s;ame, unle&s;s they find &s;ome delicacy in the &s;tile and compo&s;ition. An hone&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial mini&s;ter may wade into the &s;everal &s;tates of people, in order to bring forth &s;uitably thereunto, in the native &s;implicity of the truth, and his labour herein be &s;een, gladly owned and

received, by the circumci&s;ed in heart and ears, where his lot is ca&s;t; yet the &s;ort of people among&s;t us above-mentioned, of which I fear there are many, do not know, nor much regard him, &s;carcely thinking it worth their while to attend the meetings &s;uch a one is engaged to vi&s;it. But if they hear of one coming who is noted for learning and eloquence, though perhaps far &s;hort of the other in depth of experience, what fol|lowing after him from meeting to meet|ing! Enough, if the in&s;trument is not pretty well grounded, to puff it up with a vain conceit of it&s;elf, and to exalt it above mea&s;ure. Some have with &s;orrow ob&s;erved, much hurt has been done among&s;t us, by &s;uch great imprudence. I have often &s;een rea&s;on to conclude, popularity and common applau&s;e is no &s;afe rule to judge of the real worth of a mini&s;ter. Therefore, when I have heard much crying-up of any in&s;tru|ment, I have been apt to doubt its &s;afe &s;tanding, and holding out to the end; which it cannot po&s;&s;ibly do, if the &s;ame de&s;ire pre|vails to &s;peak, as there is in &s;uch people to hear. I am per&s;uaded, if &s;uch keep upon a right bottom, they will, at times, find it their duty to &s;tarve and di&s;appoint &s;uch cravings after words.</P>
<P>I had an open &s;atisfactory meeting at Lan|ca&s;ter the day after the quarterly-meeting, in which the holy virtue of truth greatly united friends in the bond of love and peace. The

14th of the 7th month I &s;et out, in company with my kind friends Jonathan R<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ine and wife, William Dilworth, and Tabitha Ecroyd, and lodged that night at Watton, near Pre&s;|ton. Next morning I took my leave of the above &s;aid friends in much near affec|tion, except William Dilworth, who ac|companied me to Warrington that day. The next, being the fir&s;t of the week, I attended Penketh meeting in the morning, and Warrington in the afternoon. At both which, my labour in the mini&s;try was heavy and painful, on account of the formal, lifele&s;s &s;tate of too many, who, by their age and long profe&s;&s;ion, might have been as pillars in the church; as well as the chaf|fine&s;s, and want of &s;olid experience by their not yielding to the vi&s;itation of truth, in many of a younger rank. Thus it is, when heavenly ble&s;&s;ings have been &s;howered down upon people, not duly improving thereby, they become more in&s;en&s;ible than others who have not been &s;o highly favoured. I was enabled to di&s;charge the &s;ervice re|quired, in a &s;earching, awakening manner, to my own relief in a good degree. I went the next day to my worthy friend Jo&s;hua Toft's, near Leek, who had then lo&s;t his &s;ight, but &s;eemed fre&s;h and lively in his &s;pirit. We had great &s;atisfaction in com|pany and conver&s;ation with each other. I &s;taid one whole day with him and his bro|ther, and then proceeded towards Worce&s;ter,
<PB N="270" REF="016793_0275_0F9E68FFD2272FB0">
taking meetings at Dudley and Stourbridge. I had &s;ome open &s;atisfactory &s;ervice at the fir&s;t, and a very laborious painful time in &s;ilence, at the other, where truth &s;eemed to me much depre&s;&s;ed by wrong things. On &s;eventh-day I went from thence to Worce&s;ter, and attended their fir&s;t-day meetings, and was mournfully affected there|in with a &s;en&s;e of lukewarmne&s;s in many profe&s;&s;ors, finding it very hard for the life and power of truth to ari&s;e into dominion, &s;o as to make them &s;en&s;ible of their &s;tates. My labour was for the mo&s;t part in &s;ilence, though I had &s;ome clo&s;e public &s;ervice. I went after the la&s;t meeting as far as Eve|&s;ham, on my way to London, and from thence, the next day home to my dear wife, and found her well; which, together with other favours, I was, through infinite kind|ne&s;s, made a partaker of in this journey, bowed my mind in humble thankfulne&s;s to the bountiful author of all ble&s;&s;ings, who is alone worthy of dominion and wor&s;hip for evermore. I was from home about five weeks and five days, and travel|led, by account, 664 miles, and was at 37 meetings.</P>
<P>I have pre&s;erved no account in writing, of my travelling in the &s;ervice of truth, after I returned from the la&s;t-mentioned journey, until the fore part of the year 1760, when I entered upon my journey, in order to vi&s;it the meetings of friends in the nation of
<PB N="271" REF="016793_0276_0F9E69011DA5DBE8">
Ireland a &s;econd time; having had it weightily upon my mind, at times, for &s;ome years. But when it drew near, I clearly &s;aw the time fixed to &s;et out, which I did the fir&s;t of the 3d month, in the afore|&s;aid year, and went to London. The 2d being on fir&s;t-day, I went to Grace-church-Street meeting in the morning. My bu&s;ine&s;s therein was to &s;et an example of &s;ilence. In the afternoon I had good open &s;ervice at Devon&s;hire-Hou&s;e meeting. On &s;econd-day morning the 3d I went into the We&s;t-Che&s;ter &s;tage coach, and arrived at that city on fifth-day night, the 6th. I went next day to Park-Gate, to inquire for a pa&s;&s;age, where I found divers ve&s;&s;els ready to &s;ail; yet the wind being contrary, it was uncertain when; &s;ome having already wait|ed near a month for a fair wind. I return|ed to Che&s;ter that night, and next day was poorly of a cold, having, &s;ince my great illne&s;s, been very tender in my lungs, and apt to be afflicted with an a&s;thmatick di&s;|order; &s;o that travelling, e&s;pecially in cold foggy weather, became very unplea&s;ant for me to bear, having endured con&s;iderable hard&s;hips in my journey from London, by &s;uch weather and the motion of the coach. But all was made up, in the &s;weet enjoyment of that pure love, which makes hard things ea&s;y and bitter things &s;weet. The 9th, being fir&s;t-day, I was at Che&s;ter meeting, the number of friends being but
<PB N="272" REF="016793_0277_0F9E690168AE5E20">
&s;mall, and the life of religion very low; yet it plea&s;ed divine goodne&s;s to extend mer|ciful help, giving me openne&s;s in the &s;pringing up of life, to admini&s;ter &s;uitably for their advantage, I hope, if rightly im|proved. The 10th in the morning, having hired a guide and two hor&s;es, I &s;et out for Holy Head, in order to take a pa&s;&s;age for Dublin in one of the packets, and got thi|ther next day about &s;ix in the evening. Here I found one of the packets was to &s;ail early next morning. I went on board the 12th, about &s;ix o'clock in the morn|ing, and landed at Dublin about &s;ix in the evening, the &s;ame day, having had an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age and civil u&s;age on board, and was kindly received by my open-hearted friends Samuel Judd and family. I was pretty much fatigued with travelling, being al&s;o afflicted with a cold upon my lungs, which was aggravated by the thick &s;ulphurous air of Dublin. Yet the pure virtue and holy anointing of the precious truth, carried through and over all weakne&s;s, both of body and mind. My &s;oul being enabled to extol and magnify the God of my &s;alva|tion, for his gracious &s;upport every way; for indeed, humanly looking and judging of things, it might not have appeared prudent, con&s;idering my weak and infirm &s;tate of body, e&s;pecially alone, to have undertook &s;uch a journey; but the power of go&s;pel love gaining the a&s;cendency over all rea&s;on|ings
<PB N="273" REF="016793_0278_0F9E690223A8DC48">
and con&s;ultations with fle&s;h and blood, made me willing to give up life and all, in an&s;wering the Lord's requirings, and to pur&s;ue what he was plea&s;ed to call me unto, as far as ability of body would admit. This is a great my&s;tery to the carnal man, but it hath as real an exi&s;tence in a re|deemed mind, as that a principle of &s;elf-love is the &s;pring of action in an unredeem|ed mind. On &s;ixth-day, the 13th, I went to the week day meeting at Sycamore-Alley, where humbling goodne&s;s was refre&s;hingly near, and opened the doctrines of truth largely and livingly, to the comfort of many hearts. On fir&s;t-day, the 16th, I went to Meath-Street in the morning, where I had thorough &s;ervice, to mine own great com|fort and ea&s;e; though my &s;pirit was much grieved, to view the havock made among&s;t friends in that great city, by undue liber|ties; but mo&s;t of all under a mournful &s;en&s;e, that the dragon's tail had drawn &s;ome of the &s;tars down again into earthly pollu|tions, and cau&s;ed a bad &s;avour. This was offen&s;ive to my &s;oul, even as a nui&s;ance in that meeting. May others harm and mi&s;|carriages cau&s;e all the Lord's anointed to be very watchful. I went to Sycamore-Alley in the afternoon, where the meeting was very large. Silent waiting upon God was my &s;ervice therein, in which I had peace and comfort; and towards the conclu&s;ion, there was an awful &s;olemnity, in a remark|able
<PB N="274" REF="016793_0279_0F9E6902E2F3D870">
manner, over the meeting, wherein the excellency of &s;ilent wor&s;hip appeared. On &s;econd-day, the 17th, I went to Baltibois and had a meeting there next day. I had clo&s;e rou&s;ing &s;ervice therein; the te&s;timony of truth went forth very &s;harp again&s;t haughty libertine &s;pirits. There I met my good friend Abraham Shakleton, who tra|velled with me mo&s;t of the time I was in that nation. Of him, I think, it may be &s;aid, as was of Nathaniel,
<Q>Behold an I&s;raelite indeed, in whom there is no guile!</Q>
He was a great comfort and help to me, and though he did not appear public|ly as a mini&s;ter; yet he would drop tender advice at times, in families, in a very affect|ing manner. His whole conver&s;ation, looks, and deportment, was &s;o leavened and tem|pered with the good, that I looked upon him as a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s where|ever he came. I went with him, after the above&s;aid meeting, to his hou&s;e at Bally|tore, where next day I had a precious open meeting, and good thorough &s;ervice there|in; the ble&s;&s;ed unchangeable truth being in dominion over all. The 20th I had a good &s;erviceable meeting at Athy, and the next day another at Rathanyon, in which there was a wonderful manife&s;tation of the divine power, and much clearne&s;s in opening the doctrines of truth; &s;o that I believe there were few, if any, but were &s;en&s;ibly affected therewith. I hope &s;uch great extendings of
<PB N="275" REF="016793_0280_0F9E69040351BB40">
favour will not be ea&s;ily forgot. From thence I went to Edenderry, and was at their meeting on fir&s;t-day, the 23d, which was a very large meeting, and the power and wi&s;dom of truth was eminently mani|fe&s;ted, in furni&s;hing with ability, to divide the word aright to the &s;everal &s;tates in that great meeting. It was in much dread and weight, not &s;paring any rank or &s;tation in the &s;ociety. All there, I believe, through divine favour, had &s;ome &s;hare of that day's work: I hope not ea&s;ily to be forgotten. May the Lord alone have the prai&s;e! for he is the author of all the good that is, or can be done. The 25th I had a large meeting at Mount-Melick, in which I had thorough &s;ervice. The labour was &s;ome|what painful, in a &s;en&s;e of indifference, and the in&s;ipid formal &s;tate of too many, as well as the pride and undue liberties of others; both which have &s;orrowfully pre|vailed in that nation; yet I found great ea&s;e and peace of mind, in the di&s;charge of that weighty concern which was upon me for their help and recovery, and which I hope had a good effect on many. Next day I had a large meeting at Mount-Rath. I was en|abled to di&s;charge the &s;ervice required, in a &s;earching manner, that carele&s;s profe&s;&s;ors might be &s;tirred up to their re&s;pective duties, and ancient zeal, ardour, and beauty re&s;tored to the churches. From thence I went to James Huchin&s;on's, where I had
<PB N="276" REF="016793_0281_0F9E690539EBBE58">
an open &s;erviceable meeting; I hope to the comfort and help of many. The 28th I had a meeting at Ballinakill, where I had a good degree of openne&s;s, for the help and encouragement of friends in the way of well-doing; but things were very low there, as to the life of religion. I went after meeting to Carlow, in order to attend the province &s;ix weeks meeting. Many friends, from the &s;everal parts of the province, came to it. It was a large meeting, and con&s;idering the low declined &s;tate of things, we were favoured with wonderful extend|ings of heavenly power, wi&s;dom, and living virtue, in order to heal and re&s;tore back|&s;liding I&s;rael. Great and marvellous is, and hath been, the conde&s;cen&s;ion of the Almighty to his people, through all ages! The doctrine of the go&s;pel flowed forth freely to the &s;everal &s;tates of tho&s;e pre&s;ent, and many were much humbled, in an aw|ful &s;en&s;e of the divine pre&s;ence, which is the life and &s;trength of God's people. I had a large meeting at the &s;ame place on fir&s;t-day, the 30th, it was a ble&s;&s;ed oppor|tunity of favour and &s;aving help extended to tho&s;e pre&s;ent: &s;urely, if the&s;e high bene|fits are not duly improved, great will be the condemnation of tho&s;e upon whom they are be&s;towed. I went from thence home, with my kind friends Robert Lackey and wife, and had the next day a precious open meeting and good &s;ervice therein,
<PB N="277" REF="016793_0282_0F9E6905E269B140">
at the hou&s;e of our worthy ancient friend Samuel Wat&s;on, of Killconner. I went from thence to Ro&s;s, where, at the hou&s;e of Samuel Ely, I had a low afflicting meet|ing, but little to be felt of the life of re|ligion. I was quite &s;hut up as to mini&s;try. From thence I went to Waterford, where on the 3d of the 4th month, I had a large meeting; it proved a time of clo&s;e labour; yet I waded through to mine own ea&s;e, in a good degree. On the 4th, I had an open precious meeting at Clonmell. Oh, how the heavenly virtue did &s;tream forth! in doctrine and coun&s;el, for the help, encou|ragement, and &s;tirring up of friends and others, to their religious duty. The great name of our God was adored and mag|nified. The 5th I went to Cork, and at|tended their meetings on fir&s;t-day. They were large, and although the declen&s;ion from the life and &s;implicity of truth is very great and obvious among&s;t friends in that city, and many under our name are much defiled with the love of earthly gratifica|tions, preferring their outward intere&s;t to that of religion; yet great was the extend|ings of divine love and favour for their help and recovery. The doctrines of the go&s;pel were thereby largely and livingly opened, I hope to the comfort and help of many, cau&s;ing the hearts of a &s;incere, up|right-minded remnant among&s;t them great|ly to rejoice with thankfulne&s;s. On third-day,
<PB N="278" REF="016793_0283_0F9E69094465E678">
the 8th, I attended a very large meet|ing there, both of friends and people of other religious per&s;ua&s;ions; it being ap|pointed for the marriage of our friend Samuel Neal to a daughter of Jo&s;hua Beale, and grand-daughter of our worthy friend Jo&s;eph Pike, decea&s;ed. The fore part of this meeting was very cloudy and painful, but the &s;incere travail of the upright in heart prevailed with the Lord to ari&s;e; then his enemies were &s;cattered, and the glorious powerful truth &s;hone forth in its beauty, whereby the poor had the go&s;pel to preach, in the ble&s;&s;ed demon&s;tration thereof. It was a time not to be ea&s;ily forgotten; made &s;o by his refre&s;hing pre&s;ence, who turned our water of affliction into the re|viving wine of his kingdom; to whom, for the multitude of his mercies to his church and people, be humble thank&s;giv|ing, &s;incere obedience, and prai&s;es for ever|more, Amen! I went from Cork direct|ly to Limerick, where on the 11th I had a thorough open meeting, and the te&s;ti|mony of truth was greatly exalted, I hope to the comfort and help of many. I often much admired the divine conde&s;cen&s;ion, in the open vi&s;itations of his unmerited love and long-&s;uffering kindne&s;s, to a greatly revolted and back&s;liding people. But what we finite creatures cannot comprehend, of his unfathomable regard to the workman|&s;hip of his hands, we ought to adore and
<PB N="279" REF="016793_0284_0F9E690AA6FB9570">
wor&s;hip him for, with reverence and awful fear. So be it, &s;aith my &s;oul, both in time and eternity. I went from thence to Kill|connen-Moor, where on fir&s;t-day, the 13th, I attended their meeting, which was but &s;mall, and my &s;ervice therein was very la|borious. The te&s;timony given to bear went forth very &s;harp again&s;t wrong liberties, I was much afflicted, in a &s;en&s;e of the al|mo&s;t de&s;olate &s;tate of that meeting, which that worthy man John A&s;hton, being fir&s;t him&s;elf convinced in that remote place, was the in&s;trument, in the Lord's hand, by his &s;avoury circum&s;pect life and labour to gather. I had a meeting in the afternoon at Birr, where there are but few of our &s;o|ciety, but many of the people called me|thodi&s;ts, and &s;oldiers came in. The go&s;|pel of life and &s;alvation was largely preach|ed unto them. The nece&s;&s;ity of the new-birth was urged and pre&s;&s;ingly enforced. The nature whereof, from a degree of ex|perience, being &s;et forth, the meeting ap|peared to be generally affected, and, I hope, it was a &s;erviceable time. Some of the methodi&s;ts did in words expre&s;s their great &s;atisfaction, after meeting, beyond what I choo&s;e to mention. On the 15th I had a very painful exerci&s;ing meeting at the Moat. Great indeed was the di&s;tre&s;s of my mind, viewing the general hardne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibi|lity, as well as the vain frothy light &s;pirits of &s;ome. I had very little openne&s;s, and
<PB N="280" REF="016793_0285_0F9E690BE05E06A8">
&s;carcely any thing to deliver, but under a &s;en&s;e of the Lord's anger being kindled again&s;t them, by whom, if they do not re|pent, they will be rejected. Though, I hope, there were &s;ome few had a degree of tenderne&s;s and good de&s;ires; but, alas! it is a hard lot for &s;uch who have a &s;en&s;e of feeling, to be incorporated with a peo|ple generally &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of the life of re|ligion; but the Lord is all-&s;ufficient for tho&s;e who put their tru&s;t in him. From thence I went to the Freeman's, near Old-Ca&s;tle, where, on the 18th in the morn|ing, I had a meeting held at their hou&s;e, for our friends only, in which I had matter and utterance given &s;uitable to the &s;tates of the few pre&s;ent, who were pretty much affected with the te&s;timony of truth. In the afternoon I had a large meeting in friends meeting-hou&s;e at Old-Ca&s;tle. I under&s;tood after meeting, they were mo&s;tly papi&s;ts. I had a large opportunity to pub|li&s;h the truths of the go&s;pel, with con|&s;iderable clearne&s;s; &s;hewing the nece&s;&s;ity of obtaining victory over &s;in, through the power and efficacy of living faith in Chri&s;t; by whom only, full remi&s;&s;ion of &s;in is to be obtained, upon &s;incere repentance; &s;hew|ing, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the great danger of &s;uppo&s;ing the Almighty hath delegated the power of forgiving &s;ins to any man, or &s;et of men whatever; that all who were de&s;irous to be freed therefrom, mu&s;t know the work
<PB N="281" REF="016793_0286_0F9E690BE579EAF8">
of God's &s;pirit in their hearts, to work that change, or to bring forth that new-birth our Lord taught Nicodemus the nece&s;&s;ity of. The auditory were generally quiet and attentive, appearing to depart well &s;ati&s;|fied. One of the papi&s;ts after meeting did to me expre&s;s much &s;atisfaction with the doctrine delivered. But I under&s;tood one or two prie&s;ts were much offended there|with, yet they &s;aid nothing to me; &s;o all pa&s;&s;ed off quiet, as was my mind, having &s;weet comfort in the labour of that day. From thence I went to Coothill, and the 20th was at their fir&s;t-day meeting, where|in I was largely concerned in a clo&s;e rou|&s;ing te&s;timony. It was very &s;harp again&s;t the inordinate love of the world, which, and other undue liberty, &s;eemed to me to have almo&s;t laid that meeting wa&s;te. Their monthly-meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s was held that day, which to me was another token of their little regard to the great cau&s;e of re|ligion and virtue, that they could not find it in their hearts to be&s;tow another day for tran&s;acting the weighty affairs of the church, which I have always ob&s;erved to be the ca&s;e, where friends are really alive in religion, and not narrowed up by the love of the world. It hath often appeared wonderful to me, how the profe&s;&s;ors of truth dare offer &s;uch an indignity to the infinite being, and his awful work, as to put it off until it &s;uits them be&s;t, and when they are likely to &s;uf|fer
<PB N="282" REF="016793_0287_0F9E690CA72ECEB8">
the lead di&s;advantange in that re&s;pect to their outward affairs. What is pointed out by the offerings under the law, being of the fir&s;t year and without blemi&s;h? And what is meant by offering the fir&s;t-fruits to the Lord? Oh, how ungratefully do &s;ome act, as if any thing, or any time, was good enough to offer unto him! I have ob&s;erved in &s;ome places, though I can with com|fort &s;ay, it was but in very few, that they hold their monthly and quarterly-meetings in the afternoon, and having thus limit|ed them&s;elves for time, they &s;eem as if they could &s;pare but little of it in &s;ilent waiting, to &s;eek the Lord's ble&s;&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and in faith to look for the pour|ing forth of the holy &s;pirit promi&s;ed in this go&s;pel-day. But I have ob&s;erved them to enter on the bu&s;ine&s;s as they have come out of the world; moving in the&s;e weighty affairs in man's natural abilities, whereby darkne&s;s reigns, and the glorious light and life of truth is ob&s;cured, and they come to be &s;o benighted, as to &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity to wait for it. Thus all living zeal, and every qualification for carrying on the Lord's work is lo&s;t, and vain man thinks he can do without it. I am well a&s;&s;ured, by living experience, as well as the practice truth hath led friends into in all places (a few excepted) that it is the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of our &s;ociety, every where, to dedicate a week-day, viz. a day when they are not
<PB N="283" REF="016793_0288_0F9E690D65DA9510">
debarred by the laws of the land to fol|low their outward bu&s;ine&s;s, for tran&s;acting the weighty affairs of di&s;cipline and good order; and to meet in the fore-part there|of, men and women together, then and there to wait upon the Lord, for the virtue of his holy &s;pirit; and when they have thus waited a proper time, then the men and women in their &s;eparate apartments, with awful fear, and a weighty care upon all their minds as in the pre&s;ence of the Lord, to proceed in their re&s;pective parts of this great work; which is the Lord's, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly be profitably done but by his immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This I leave upon record, as my well-grounded te&s;timony for God and his church. I attended what they called their monthly-meeting, and by looking a little into the &s;tate of things, I found them much out of order, and did not wonder at it, as I found they had dropped their week-day meeting. At my reque&s;t the women were de&s;ired to be pre&s;ent, when much labour was be&s;towed for their help, particularly to revive their week-day meet|ing; they agreed to endeavour for it, and made a minute for that purpo&s;e in their monthly-meeting book. But, alas! the life of religion &s;eemed to be almo&s;t lo&s;t; their &s;tate being confu&s;ed and di&s;orderly, by mixed marriages, and the neglect of di&s;|cipline. They appeared part one thing and part another; which, if it was &s;o offen&s;ive
<PB N="284" REF="016793_0289_0F9E690E242F90A8">
to God, and &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to his people under the old covenant, how can it be le&s;s &s;o now? But when people's views are car|nal and &s;elfi&s;h, they regard none of the&s;e things, although the hazard is &s;o infinitely great. I had a &s;mall poor meeting at Ca&s;tle-&s;hane next day, where, to my great &s;orrow and pain, I could not perceive any alive in religion. Some labour in te&s;timony was be&s;towed, but to outward appearance it took very little effect. From thence I went to Thomas Greer's, at Dungannon, and on the 23d had a large meeting at Charle|mount, where I was concerned to declare truth, as utterance was given, in a very clo&s;e &s;earching manner; not without &s;harp rebukes to &s;uch, who, by defiling liberties, had brought an ill &s;avour and cau&s;ed the way of truth to be evil &s;poken of. My mind was comfortably relieved after the &s;ervice of this meeting was over, being di&s;|charged of a heavy load. The next day I had a very painful and exerci&s;ing meeting at Ballyhagan. The appearance of the pro|fe&s;&s;ors was in general plain; but, alas! with re&s;pect to the life of religion, they &s;eemed, in my view, for the mo&s;t part, like pictures or images. Surely the blindne&s;s and &s;tupi|dity mu&s;t be exceeding great, if it be po&s;|&s;ible for people in that &s;tate, to imagine or dream they are the people of God. I was, through divine favour, enabled to clear my&s;elf of them, by a &s;harp &s;earching and
<PB N="285" REF="016793_0290_0F9E690F21C7ACB0">
clo&s;e te&s;timony, in the di&s;charge whereof I had peace. The meeting was very large, as to number. The 25th I went to the province meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, held in Lurgan. My &s;pirit was deeply affected therein, with a &s;orrowful &s;en&s;e, that &s;ome of the leaders of the people had cau&s;ed them to err, and by their love for, and eager pur&s;uit after worldly enjoyments, had large|ly contributed to ob&s;cure the way of the Lord, &s;o that the &s;erious inquirers after the paths which lead to peace, could not, by ob&s;erving their &s;teps, find them out. Oh, what a deplorable &s;tate that is! I was fa|voured with living authority and clearne&s;s, to di&s;charge my mind towards &s;uch with great plainne&s;s, which &s;eemed to fa&s;ten clo&s;ely on &s;ome: may they profit thereby, and the end will be an&s;wered. The province meet|ing was held next day, in which I had weighty &s;ervice. But, alas I they are far gone (a few excepted) from the life and power of religion; yet I found much good-will ex|tended for their recovery and help, and the heavenly power wonderfully opened my mouth, and enlarged my heart, to deliver &s;uitable doctrine to their conditions, in which I had peace, and many were affected and reached therewith. Oh, how unwilling is the Lord to give up the offspring of his people! I attended Lurgan meeting on fir&s;t-day, the 26th, which, through the divine manife&s;tations of heavenly power, was in|deed
<PB N="286" REF="016793_0291_0F9E690FA251C058">
a very awakening time to the unfaith|ful, as well as of &s;weet refre&s;hment to the few mourners in and for Sion. I went after meeting to Li&s;burn, and had a very open &s;atisfactory meeting there next day. The te&s;timony of truth went forth in an affecting manner, to the tendering many hearts. It was a time of humbling en|couragement to the hone&s;t-hearted. The next day I had a very poor afflicting meet|ing at Hill&s;borough, things being very low there. The 30th I had a very large meet|ing at Ballenderry, in which I had tho|rough &s;ervice. The te&s;timony of truth went forth with much clearne&s;s and de|mon&s;tration, being, through divine favour, an eminent time, and many &s;tates &s;poke clo&s;ely to, I hope to their advantage. On fifth-day, the fir&s;t of the 5th month, I had a meeting at Moyallen, which was a painful cloudy time. The te&s;timony delivered was very &s;earching, in order to &s;tir up carele&s;s profe&s;&s;ors, &s;ome of whom &s;eemed, in a great mea&s;ure, to have de&s;erted the cau&s;e of religion, and to have too much embraced this pre&s;ent world. The 2d I &s;et out for Dublin, in order fir&s;t to attend the province meeting for Lein&s;ter, and then the half year's meeting, both to be held there in one week. I lodged that night at an inn in Dunlere, and next day got to Dublin. On fir&s;t-day, the 4th of the 5th month, I went to Meath-Street in the morning, where
<PB N="287" REF="016793_0292_0F9E69143216AD78">
truth greatly favoured, in opening doctrine and coun&s;el, to the edification and comfort of many, as well as in caution and warning to the di&s;obedient and lukewarm profe&s;&s;ors. In the afternoon at Sycamore-Alley, it pro|ved a laborious painful time of &s;ilence, to which, perhaps, the expectation and de&s;ire of the people after words might not a lit|tle contribute. On &s;econd-day, the 5th, was held their province meeting of mini|&s;ters and elders. It was a painful heavy time, but, through divine favour, &s;ome relief was admini&s;tered towards the con|clu&s;ion. Next day was held the quarterly-meeting for Lein&s;ter province, in which I had open thorough &s;ervice, both in mini&s;|try, and al&s;o in relation to good order and the di&s;cipline of the church. On fourth-day, the 8th of the 5th month, third hour in the afternoon, began their national meet|ing of mini&s;ters and elders, wherein the Lord was plea&s;ed to open profitable in|&s;truction, to the great comfort and edifica|tion of many. Next day we had a meeting for wor&s;hip in the morning, wherein di|vine favour was plentifully extended, and the doctrine of truth largely opened. The meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s for the whole nation was held in the afternoon, in which a de|gree of divine wi&s;dom and &s;trength were admini&s;tered for our help in the manage|ment thereof. On &s;ixth-day morning was held a large meeting for wor&s;hip at Syca|more-Alley,
<PB N="288" REF="016793_0293_0F9E6915A9D620F8">
which was wonderfully over|&s;hadowed with heavenly goodne&s;s, and the te&s;timony of truth went forth freely, being much exalted. In the afternoon the affairs of the church continued; and on &s;eventh-day, both fore and afternoon were employed in them. Divine goodne&s;s was com|fortably near, for the help and recovery of a declined people, &s;tirring up the hearts of &s;ome, as he did the heart of Nehemiah formerly, to &s;eek the pro&s;perity and welfare of the city of God. I found a con&s;iderable alteration for the better, by &s;ome reviving and growth in the life of religion, among&s;t friends in this nation. That painful flat|ne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility, which I former|ly mourned &s;orely under a &s;en&s;e of, did not appear &s;o generally to over&s;pread the churches now, as then; though in &s;ome places it was rather wor&s;e than better; yet I think, upon the whole, things were mended in a religious &s;en&s;e. The Lord, in merciful kindne&s;s to them, not only &s;ent divers &s;ub&s;tantial in&s;truments from di&s;tant parts, to vi&s;it them; but al&s;o, as before noted, moved upon the hearts of &s;ome a|mong&s;t them&s;elves, to labour for re&s;tor|ing ancient comeline&s;s, by vi&s;iting their monthly and quarterly, or province meet|ings, for the promotion of good order and di&s;cipline; the reviving whereof, in the wi&s;dom which is from above, proves an ef|fectual means to increa&s;e and exalt the vir|tue
<PB N="289" REF="016793_0294_0F9E691663C31720">
and power of true religion. A concern of this nature came weightily upon the na|tional meeting at this time, in the feeling whereof, under the holy influence of hea|venly light, friends nominated a certain number to vi&s;it the monthly meetings in Lein&s;ter province.</P>
<P>I cannot well omit making a remark upon appointments, as I apprehend &s;ome have, by the &s;ubtilty of Satan, been pre|vailed upon to reject them: I believe all &s;uch do not de&s;ign an injury to the &s;ociety; but he who deceives them, intends there|by the ob&s;tructing that great and nece&s;&s;ary engagement, of maintaining good order and di&s;cipline. I ardently de&s;ire, that all who undertake to move and act in the church of God, may be well informed what is the &s;pring of action to them, and moves them therein. If it be the &s;pirit of God, they dare do nothing again&s;t the truth, but all in their power in order to promote it, that being their greate&s;t delight. But if it be &s;elf, it will &s;eek its own honour, and be very fond of victory, and be di&s;gu&s;ted when it cannot rule and carry matters and things its own way.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t-day, the 11th, many country friends being yet in the city, we had, it was thought, the large&s;t meeting known at &s;uch a time, for many years, and, by the ble&s;&s;ed dominion of the everla&s;ting truth, it was a time of great favour. The &s;incere-hearted were &s;weetly comforted, the
<PB N="290" REF="016793_0295_0F9E691729AEDE30">
di&s;obedient warned, and in the free power|ful opening of go&s;pel life, much doctrine and coun&s;el were admini&s;tered, tending to beget faith in the eternal power of God. The afternoon meeting was, for the mo&s;t part, held in an awful &s;olemn &s;ilence. On &s;econd-day was held a meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, wherein divine goodne&s;s was plea&s;ed to open the free fountain of life and healing virtue; in whom we had to re|joice with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory. His name was greatly exalted, mag|nified, and adored among&s;t us. After this meeting, apprehending my&s;elf now quite clear of any farther &s;ervice, at this time, having, through infinite kindne&s;s, been much favoured and enlarged therein, through mo&s;t parts of the nation, but more e&s;pecially at the late great meetings in Dublin, I was very earne&s;t in my mind to embark for England, and &s;o to leave things whil&s;t fre&s;h and well; always having an aver&s;ion to loitering among&s;t friends until they flatten. But though there were &s;eve|ral &s;hips ready to &s;ail for Parkgate, yet I could not get away till after their week-day meeting, on third-day, in Meath-Street; to which meeting, I mu&s;t &s;ay, I went with con&s;iderable reluctance, for the rea&s;on above-mentioned. But we are very &s;hort-&s;ighted creatures; for this meeting, notwith&s;tand|ing my unwillingne&s;s to be at it, proved a memorable time: many country friends be|ing

&s;till in the city, it was a &s;olemn taking leave one of another, in the precious flowing of the holy unity by the one &s;pirit. Next day about noon, in company with &s;even friends intending for the yearly-meeting in London, I embarked on board the Kil|dare, captain M'Culloch, and landed at Parkgate about ten o'clock next morning, where we hired hor&s;es and proceeded to|wards London. But when we had travelled as far as Coventry, apprehending I might reach home, &s;o as to have three whole days with my family before the yearly-meeting; and it being but about twenty miles more riding, I concluded therefore to do &s;o; my kind friend Robert Lackey agreeing to bear me company. This being on &s;eventh-day, the 17th, we got to Northampton that night, and &s;taid their meeting next day, which was &s;mall, and the life of religion appeared to me very low there. The meeting was held in &s;ilence. I got home on third-day, the 20th of the 5th month, 1760, finding my dear wife and family in good health, to our mutual joy and thank|fulne&s;s to the Lord, who leads out, carries through, and brings home again in peace, tho&s;e who tru&s;t in him. Ble&s;&s;ed and prai&s;ed be his worthy name for ever! I was in|deed largely favoured in the before-men|tioned journey, of which, for mine en|couragement to give up in humble con|fidence in the Lord's power, I had a clear
<PB N="292" REF="016793_0297_0F9E6918C0038A40">
fore&s;ight before I entered upon it, which I e&s;teemed a high favour. I was from home about twelve weeks and three days, travel|led in that time upwards of 1300 miles, and was at about 58 meetings. Our friend Robert Lackey, my&s;elf and wife, went to the yearly-meeting in London, which began on &s;eventh-day the 24th of the 5th month, for mini&s;ters and elders. An e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, which I hope will be of great &s;ervice throughout the &s;ociety in the&s;e na|tions; as inquiries are made at this meet|ing, by calling for an&s;wers from the &s;eve|ral parts, to certain queries agreed on, re|lating to the conduct of friends in the &s;ta|tions above-mentioned; and advice admini|&s;tered as occa&s;ion may require. Common rea&s;on will inform us, that when the main pillars give way, the building mu&s;t inevita|bly fall. It is therefore prudent to take due care concerning them. An eminent &s;ervant of the Lord wi&s;ely ob&s;erved to this effect, viz. That there never was an apo|&s;tacy from the life and purity of religion, until the mini&s;ters and elders gave way. How important then are their &s;tations, and what great need have they them&s;elves, and likewi&s;e the church, carefully to ob&s;erve whether or no they &s;tand upright, &s;eeing &s;o much depends thereon. On &s;econd-day following was opened the yearly-meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s, which continued, by adjourn|ments, mo&s;t or all the week; being a &s;olemn
<PB N="293" REF="016793_0298_0F9E6919BA7D7708">
weighty meeting, of very great import|ance to the &s;ociety: careful inquiries are there made, into the &s;tate thereof, in order to communicate &s;uch help, as in the wi&s;|dom of truth may appear proper and nece&s;|&s;ary. I am free to give a &s;hort account here, of the beginning or ri&s;e of one very import|ant affair which came before this yearly-meeting, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion hereafter to make &s;ome mention of its progre&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s, viz. A nomination of friends, to vi&s;it all the monthly and quarterly-meet|ings of friends in this nation, for their help, in promoting good order and di&s;cipline in the &s;everal parts. Upon reading the an|&s;wers to the u&s;ual queries from the &s;e|veral quarterly-meetings, great &s;lackne&s;s and unfaithfulne&s;s in divers places in &s;ome weighty branches of our Chri&s;tian te&s;ti|mony appeared, notwith&s;tanding the great and earne&s;t endeavours made u&s;e of by the yearly-meeting from year to year, by way of advice, caution, and coun&s;el: the &s;en&s;e whereof deeply affected &s;ome minds, who, in humble pro&s;tration before the Lord, were ready to &s;ay, What wilt thou do for thy great name's &s;ake, and to heal the back|&s;lidings of thy people? A friend under this exerci&s;e, and an awful &s;en&s;e of the divine pre&s;ence which was near, &s;tood up, taking notice of the apparent defection above-hint|ed; and that as all the means hitherto u&s;ed by the truly Chri&s;tian labour of preceding
<PB N="294" REF="016793_0299_0F9E6AC8BA1A2540">
yearly-meetings, had not proved &s;ufficient to &s;top the declen&s;ion, which &s;eemed rather to increa&s;e; that now it behoved that meet|ing, deeply and weightily to con&s;ider what remained yet to be done for the help and recovery of the &s;ociety, to its ancient purity and comely order, or to that import. This &s;eemed to open the way for our worthy friend Jo&s;eph White of Penn&s;ylvania, who was then upon a religious vi&s;it in this na|tion, to lay before that meeting what he &s;aid had been much upon his mind mo&s;t of the time &s;ince he landed, and which &s;eemed to increa&s;e in clearne&s;s and weight as that yearly-meeting drew near; and that he now found it was the proper time to deliver the &s;ame, viz. That the yearly-meeting do appoint a &s;uitable num|ber of &s;olid, weighty, judicious friends, to vi&s;it all the quarterly and monthly-meet|ings in England, therein to u&s;e their Chri&s;|tian endeavours, in the love of God, for the promotion and revival of whole&s;ome di&s;cipline, and the comely order of the go&s;|pel in the churches. Great was the awful &s;olemnity which covered the meeting, dur|ing its deliberation on this very important affair. The weight of the heavenly power was &s;o exceeding great and awful, that it was very hard for any contrary &s;pirits to appear; yet objections again&s;t appointments for &s;uch &s;ervices were advanced by &s;ome. It was therefore propo&s;ed, that friends who
<PB N="295" REF="016793_0300_0F9E6A8C611F9D40">
found a concern on their minds to engage in the &s;aid undertaking, would give in their names. The Lord's heavenly power being at work, like leaven, in the meeting, a wonderful time of divine favour it was, wherein about fifty-eight offered them&s;elves accordingly.</P>
<P>Before I in&s;ert any account of the progre&s;s made in the above-mentioned &s;er|vice, I have to take notice of a journey into the We&s;t of England, which, in company with my friend Richard Brew&s;ter, I entered upon the 9th of the 9th month this year. We went to Plai&s;tow monthly-meeting, where, unexpectedly, I had &s;ome pretty clo&s;e &s;ervice. Next day, being joined at London by my e&s;teemed friend Thomas Corbyn, we proceeded on our way, in order to at|tend the circular yearly-meeting for the we&s;tern counties, to be held at Wotton-under-Edge, in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, which be|gan on fir&s;t-day, the 14th of the 9th month, and ended on the third-day fol|lowing. Many of our &s;ociety from divers parts, attended, and a va&s;t concour&s;e of other people, who generally behaved in a becoming manner, carrying them&s;elves very re&s;pectfully to friends, and I hope the meet|ing was in the main, &s;erviceable; yet the heavenly power was not exalted to &s;o high a degree, as tho&s;e who&s;e life and all is in it could have de&s;ired. It is that alone which is able to open people's way
<PB N="296" REF="016793_0301_0F9E6A8D76BD0408">
rightly to our Sion; not the fine&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent &s;et of principles, curiou&s;|ly &s;et forth and di&s;played without it. All mini&s;ters &s;hould therefore upon all oc|ca&s;ions, eye that divine power as the only thing we &s;tand in need of, otherwi&s;e the work will be marred. We went from Wotton to Ann Young's, at Earthcott, and had a clo&s;e &s;earching meeting at Thornbury on fourth-day. Things were very low there as to the life of religion. We had a meet|ing next day at Earthcott, wherein the te&s;ti|mony of truth went forth very &s;harp again&s;t dry, formal, and di&s;orderly profe&s;&s;ors. Our friend I&s;aac Sharple&s;s was at this meeting. We went from thence to Bri&s;tol, and at|tended their meeting on &s;ixth-day, where truth and its te&s;timony was excited over wrong things; and unfaithful, di&s;orderly walkers, were, in the dominion and autho|rity thereof, warned, and the humble, &s;in|cere traveller Sion-ward, comforted: it being, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing, a good, profita|ble time. In the afternoon was held their meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, wherein we had &s;ome very clo&s;e work with a trou|ble&s;ome impo&s;ter, who had given friends there much unea&s;ine&s;s, by his un&s;avoury and un&s;anctified public appearances. The judgment of truth was &s;et over him, though he was very unwilling to &s;ubmit thereunto. On fir&s;t-day, the 21&s;t, we attended three
<PB N="297" REF="016793_0302_0F9E6A8E24227148">
meetings there; and notwith&s;tanding the mournful declen&s;ion &s;o vi&s;ible among&s;t friends in that city, yet the Lord graciou&s;ly appeared for their help and recovery; open|ing the doctrine of truth in a clear and plentiful manner to their &s;everal &s;tates, with which many appeared pretty much af|fected. And although there is yet much cau&s;e to lament their degeneracy in too general a way, yet I hope and believe there hath been a con&s;iderable reviving in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e, among&s;t &s;ome of them, e&s;pecially the youth, &s;ince I was there be|fore. On &s;econd-day morning we had a thorough rou&s;ing meeting at Port&s;head in Somer&s;et&s;hire, and in the afternoon a large meeting at Clareham; the latter was exceeding cloudy and afflicting for a con|&s;iderable time; but at length, it plea&s;ed the Lord to ari&s;e and to give the word, with under&s;tanding to divide the &s;ame in a plain, powerful manner, and a very awakening time it was; it went forth very &s;harp a|gain&s;t indifferency and empty formality, which greatly depre&s;&s;ed the true &s;eed in that meeting: I hope it was a profitable time. On third-day we had a very open, &s;erviceable meeting at Sedcott; the te&s;ti|mony of truth flowed forth freely to the &s;everal &s;tates of tho&s;e pre&s;ent. After meet|ing we went to Bridgwater. On fourth-day was held the quarterly-meeting for Somer|&s;et.
<PB N="298" REF="016793_0303_0F9E6A8F5D84EA50">
In the forenoon we had a large meeting for wor&s;hip, both of friends and others; &s;ome previous endeavours, I under|&s;tood had been u&s;ed, to invite the neigh|bours, which, I think, was not well judg|ed, neither &s;hould I have encouraged it at &s;uch a time, had I been con&s;ulted. The leadings and pointings out of truth &s;hould be always minded, in calling or inviting people of other per&s;ua&s;ions to our meetings; for I have &s;ometimes thought them a bar in the way of dealing &s;uitably with profe&s;&s;ors of the truth, and therefore it is my judg|ment, they &s;hould not be called to our meet|ings, unle&s;s tho&s;e who travel in the &s;ervice of truth &s;ignify their de&s;ire to have it &s;o, to tho&s;e who have the care of appointing meetings. The power of the go&s;pel, open|ing and exalting the doctrine thereof, was livingly and comfortably extended in that meeting; yet I apprehended, other people were then rather in the way of our hand|ling the &s;tate of &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors there, in a manner truth would have led to, had friends been by them&s;elves. The meeting of bu|&s;ine&s;s followed, and was adjourned till the afternoon, wherein truth appeared to the help of tho&s;e who know their &s;ufficiency to be of God. We who were &s;trangers, had good &s;ervice therein. Next morning we parted with my friend Thomas Corbyn, who returned home, and my companion and I proceeded on our journey. We had a meet|ing
<PB N="299" REF="016793_0304_0F9E6A8FD326E4A0">
at Taunton, on fifth-day morning, and at Milverton in the evening. At both which I had clo&s;e &s;ervice, tending to &s;tir friends up to more lively zeal and religi|ous concern of mind. On &s;ixth-day we had a painful laborious meeting at Welling|ton. The te&s;timony of truth went forth very clo&s;e and &s;harp again&s;t tho&s;e, who, under the profe&s;&s;ion thereof, bow down to the world, and its peri&s;hing enjoyments. It appeared to me, the life of religion was much depre&s;&s;ed in that meeting. On &s;eventh-day we had a meeting at Cullumpton, which was a cloudy trying time mo&s;t of the meet|ing; yet towards the conclu&s;ion, truth ob|tained the victory, and con&s;iderable domini|on over things of a contrary nature to it&s;elf. We went after meeting to Exeter, and on fir&s;t-day, the 28th, were at two meetings there; and although their number appeared con&s;iderable, yet that holy living &s;en&s;e and weight of divine virtue which is the crown and diadem of all our religious a&s;&s;emblies, was very low, and little felt, through the too general &s;lackne&s;s and lukewarmne&s;s of profe&s;&s;ors, con&s;equently, not much could be done towards exalting truth's te&s;timony a|mong&s;t them. On &s;econd-day we went to Bo|vey, and had a poor, laborious meeting, there being very few, if any, that I could find, truly alive in religion. When that is felt to be the &s;tate of any meeting, oh! what
<PB N="300" REF="016793_0305_0F9E6A90A1214708">
pain and anxiety covers the hearts of poor travellers in the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel! The next day we went to King's-bridge, and on fourth and fifth-day attended the quarter|ly-meeting for Devon&s;hire held there; wherein the great ma&s;ter of our a&s;&s;emblies graciou&s;ly conde&s;cended to their very low, weak, and un&s;kilful &s;tate, opening doctrine and coun&s;el for their help; furni&s;hing with clo&s;e admonition to &s;uch in high &s;tations, who either indulged them&s;elves or families in undue liberties, tending to lay a people wa&s;te, whom the Lord, by an out-&s;tretched arm, gathered out of the fa&s;hions and changeable cu&s;toms of a vain world, to him&s;elf the unchangeable fountain of good. On &s;ixth and &s;eventh days we travelled through Plymouth and &s;undry other towns, to Penryn, in Cornwall, and had two open, precious meetings at Falmouth, on fir&s;t-day, the fifth of the 10th month. On &s;econd-day, accompanied by many friends, we went to Penzance, where, on third-day, was held the quarterly-meeting for Corn|wall. Truth wonderfully appeared in that meeting, con&s;idering their low, weak, and unfaithful &s;tate. The te&s;timony thereof was much exalted, and went forth with clearne&s;s and good demon&s;tration to their &s;tates, and the meeting appeared to be much affected therewith. There was al&s;o &s;ome|thing very encouraging to the hone&s;t-heart|ed; I hope it was a time of awakening
<PB N="301" REF="016793_0306_0F9E6A9120496568">
and profit to many. In the evening we had what was called a &s;elect meeting, for mini&s;ters and elders; but it was &s;o far from &s;elect, that the &s;ervice &s;eemed to be wholly ob&s;tructed, by the crouding in of many who were not fit to be admitted into &s;uch meetings; where mini&s;ters and elders may, and often are concerned to u&s;e &s;uch freedoms, in advice, caution, and coun&s;el, as would be altogether un&s;uitable for tho&s;e who are raw and inexperienced to be privy to, as they might be likely to make improper u&s;e thereof. I laid before friends the hurt and di&s;advantage of &s;uch a promi&s;cuous gather|ing, upon that occa&s;ion, and advi&s;ed them to be careful not to lay wa&s;te the &s;ervice of tho&s;e meetings for the future; for I found my&s;elf much &s;traitened, as I could not, with prudence, deliver what &s;eemed to ap|pear before the view of my mind at that time, for the rea&s;on above-mentioned. On fourth-day, the concluding meeting was held at Market-Jew, wherein truth and the te&s;timony thereof was comfortably ex|alted. But, alas! &s;orrowful is the declen|&s;ion of the &s;ociety in tho&s;e parts, both as to number, and a holy living zeal; yet mer|ciful goodne&s;s was largely and affectingly extended for their help and recovery. From thence we took the following meet|ings in our return to Plymouth, viz. Au&s;tel, Li<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">kard, and Germans, where I found the life of religion mournfully low

and depre&s;&s;ed; yet the Lord was plea&s;ed to open the way to &s;ome, I hope profitable endeavours for their reviving, in the exer|ci&s;e whereof I had peace. I attended Ply|mouth meetings on fir&s;t-day, the 12th. This was a very painful, laborious time, as but very little of the life and holy efficacy of true religion had place, mo&s;t under our profe&s;&s;ion having made large advances to|wards the world, and but few endued with Chri&s;tian courage to make a &s;tand again&s;t prevailing undue liberties. The &s;tate of a meeting being thus, oh, how doth death, darkne&s;s, and in&s;en&s;ibility gain the a&s;cen|dancy! My &s;pirit was deeply afflicted at that place, yet I was, through divine favour, enabled to clear my&s;elf of the &s;ervice re|quired; whereby I had &s;ome relief. We travelled from thence directly to Exeter, and on third-day attended a meeting there, appointed for the accompli&s;hment of a mar|riage. Truth mercifully opened the way to &s;ome &s;atisfaction, in the di&s;charge of the &s;ervice required, to the advantage of the meeting. From thence we went to Chard, and had a very &s;mall poor meeting there on fifth-day morning, and was deeply affected with their low weak &s;tate. I had a pretty thorough &s;erviceable meeting in the after|noon, at Ilmin&s;ter; though I felt much pain of mind there al&s;o, in a &s;en&s;e of that which hath almo&s;t laid our &s;ociety wa&s;te in &s;ome, and exceedingly hurt it in mo&s;t
<PB N="303" REF="016793_0308_0F9E6A9423ADD1D0">
places, viz. the inordinate love of earthly things; and re&s;ting &s;atisfied in a profe&s;&s;ion of religion only. We took the following meetings in our way to Bath, viz. Yeovil, Long-Sutton, Grinton, Shepton-Mallet, Froome, Hallawtrow, and Belton; where things, as to the life and true feeling &s;en&s;e of religion, appear but low in general; yet merciful kindne&s;s was extended, in a live|ly, open, large, and powerful manner, both immediately and in&s;trumentally, in order to quicken, re&s;tore, and turn a|gain back&s;liding I&s;rael. On fir&s;t-day, the 26th of the 10th month, we attended two meetings at Bath, which were indeed pain|ful and very afflicting, as the grandeur, friend&s;hip, and vain cu&s;toms of this world, &s;eem to have almo&s;t era&s;ed from mo&s;t of their minds, the de&s;ire of &s;eeking happine&s;s in another: yet merciful conde&s;cen&s;ion was remarkably extended, in &s;ome earne&s;t and awakening endeavours, to bring them to a right &s;en&s;e of things. On &s;econd-day morning we &s;et our faces homewards, where, to my great &s;atisfaction I arrived on fourth-day in the evening, and found my dear wife and family well; having been out this journey &s;even weeks and two days, in which time, by account, we travelled upwards of 800 miles, and were at about 51 meetings.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to the direction and appoint|ment of the yearly-meeting 1760, for vi&s;it|ing the monthly and quarterly meetings of
<PB N="304" REF="016793_0309_0F9E6A94EE0806F0">
friends in this nation; on the 11th day of the 1&s;t month, 1761, my e&s;teemed friends, John Emms, Matthew Mellor, Thomas Corbyn, and Jo&s;eph Taylor, joined me at Chelmsford, we having before agreed (by divine permi&s;&s;ion) to vi&s;it the monthly and quarterly-meetings of friends, in E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridge&s;hire, Hun|tington&s;hire, the I&s;le of Ely, Hertford|&s;hire, and Bedford&s;hire. The next day, be|ing the 12th, our monthly meeting was held, wherein the above-named friends had good &s;ervice, tending to promote di&s;cipline and good order among&s;t us. The ble&s;&s;ed efficacy of the living word accompanied their hone&s;t labours, which rendered the &s;ame very acceptable to &s;ome, and I hope of general advantage for the promotion of truth. The 14th we vi&s;ited Fel&s;ted month|ly-meeting, held at Stebbing; the &s;tate of which appeared very low and weak, through the defection and lukewarmne&s;s of many members, whereby the life of religion was greatly depre&s;&s;ed; yet the Lord was graci|ou&s;ly plea&s;ed to ari&s;e, for his great name and people's &s;ake, in who&s;e living power and wi&s;dom much labour was be&s;towed for their help and recovery; a few &s;incere-hearted members among&s;t them&s;elves, join|ing with us herein. The 16th we vi&s;ited Thax&s;ted monthly-meeting, and by inquiry made, it appeared, many of their members were very &s;lack and defective in divers
<PB N="305" REF="016793_0310_0F9E6A95AC38D4D0">
branches of our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony; and mo&s;t of the active members had but little experience in the e&s;&s;ential qualifica|tions for effectual &s;ervice in the church, which mu&s;t all proceed immediately from the great Father of lights and &s;pirits. It would be very ab&s;urd to imagine a le&s;s or inferior ability to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice and &s;ound judgment, were nece&s;&s;ary under this higher and more glorious di&s;pen&s;ation, than was received by tho&s;e who judged and ruled for God in the I&s;raeliti&s;h church; it being evident the Lord was plea&s;ed to put his &s;pirit upon tho&s;e who had the weight of the affairs of that church upon them, both in their wilderne&s;s &s;tate of pro|bation, and after they quietly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the promi&s;ed land. But the &s;upernatural en|dowment, &s;o e&s;&s;ential as above hinted, is not within our reach as men, neither is it given to us, until we are emptied of our own wi&s;dom, and dive&s;ted of all depend|ance upon human accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>Our holy head was plea&s;ed to furni&s;h us with wi&s;dom and &s;trength, &s;uitable to the &s;tate of that meeting, for their information and help; and the ble&s;&s;ed virtue of truth prevailed, to the tendering of their &s;pirits. The next monthly-meeting vi&s;ited was Cogge&s;hall, on &s;econd-day, the 19th, but as I did not attend that meeting, I cannot &s;ay further concerning it, than that I un|der&s;tood it was a &s;erviceable time; much

weighty advice and coun&s;el being admini|&s;tered, to mutual &s;atisfaction and comfort. The 21&s;t we vi&s;ited Colche&s;ter monthly-meeting, where, though the life of religion appeared low, and &s;everal di&s;orders had crept in, yet divine goodne&s;s was extended in a powerful manner for their help, en|lightening the &s;pirits of &s;ome to &s;earch the camp, and to point out how to proceed in re&s;toring that which had been turned out of the way. The 22d, Manningtree monthly-meeting was held at Colche&s;ter, in which, through the pure efficacy of heavenly love and wi&s;dom, much fervent labour was be|&s;towed, for the awakening and &s;tirring up the &s;everal members to a faithful di&s;charge of their re&s;pective duties. But, alas! through the great unfaithfulne&s;s of many, di&s;cipline was but little maintained, in a manner agreeable to its dignity and worth; con&s;equently the life of religion was very low. From Colche&s;ter we went to Edmund's-Bury, in Suffolk, and vi&s;ited their monthly-meeting the 24th. It was a time of re|markable favour extended, truth bowing the &s;pirits of friends into an humble, teachable &s;tate, and, at the &s;ame time, af|fording plenty of &s;uitable coun&s;el, which was kindly received by divers members of that meeting, with whom we had near union and great &s;atisfaction; &s;everal being willing to engage in the work of reforma|tion, which appeared nece&s;&s;ary. The 26th
<PB N="307" REF="016793_0312_0F9E6A9748EE4910">
we vi&s;ited Woodbridge monthly-meeting, in which the Lord, according to his wonted merciful kindne&s;s, appeared not only in &s;preading the awful canopy of his divine power over the meeting, but al&s;o, in graciou&s;ly conde&s;cending to be a &s;pirit of judgment and coun&s;el, for the help and re|covery of a declining people; under the en|joyment of which divine favour, much labour was be&s;towed, and (as far as appeared) was well received. The 28th we vi&s;ited Beccles monthly-meeting, where things ap|peared very low and much out of order; the &s;pirit and wi&s;dom of man appeared much to rule and act among&s;t them, which is fond of &s;moothing over, and daubing with untempered mortar, crying, Peace, when there is no peace. In this difficult mournful &s;tate of things, the divine helper, in whom our only dependance remained, was near, giving judgment to a&s;&s;ign the living child to the proper mother, and to judge down wrong things, in whatever &s;ta|tions they appeared. The 29th we vi&s;ited Tivet&s;hall monthly-meeting, in Norfolk, in which, though large, as being compo&s;ed of many members, yet very great &s;lackne&s;s and unfaithfulne&s;s appeared in divers important re&s;pects; notwith&s;tanding which, we had, with thankful acknowledgments, to expe|rience the awful pre&s;ence of the Lord, who is the only &s;trength and &s;ufficiency of his little ones; under the ble&s;&s;ed influence
<PB N="308" REF="016793_0313_0F9E6A97ED5C9838">
whereof, great and deep labours were be|&s;towed, for the reviving our Chri&s;tian di&s;|cipline, and promoting the good order of the go&s;pel; the te&s;timony of truth being maintained again&s;t wrong things in that meeting, with authority and clearne&s;s; the power thereof &s;ubjecting (for the pre|&s;ent at lea&s;t) all of a contrary nature to it|&s;elf. On the 2d of the 2d month, we vi&s;ited the monthly-meeting of Wymond|ham, wherein, on the u&s;ual inquiries, things appeared very afflicting, through the great defection of many; the few who were con|cerned for good order, were weak and much di&s;couraged, &s;o that very little was done to maintain our whole&s;ome di&s;cipline, by vi&s;iting and labouring with the un|faithful and di&s;orderly walkers: yet the Lord, in great conde&s;cen&s;ion, appeared wonderfully for their and our help, ex|tending much advice and coun&s;el, and giv|ing us wi&s;dom and &s;trength to contend earne&s;tly for the faith once delivered to the &s;aints; which faith is to be demon|&s;trated by works con&s;i&s;tent therewith. The te&s;timony of truth was greatly exalted over all &s;uch, as through a mean compliance with wrong things, had mournfully deviated therefrom. The 3d we vi&s;ited their meet|ing of mini&s;ters and elders at Norwich, where the &s;tate of the members was in|quired into, by means of queries proper to &s;uch meetings; &s;olid and weighty advice
<PB N="309" REF="016793_0314_0F9E6A98A0AC2A90">
was given, where any deficiency appeared. Although I have not before now di&s;tinctly mentioned our vi&s;its to &s;elect meetings, yet we had &s;uch opportunities in mo&s;t or all the monthly-meetings where &s;uch meetings were &s;ettled. On the 4th of the 2d month, we vi&s;ited the monthly-meeting of Nor|wich, which was very large, con&s;i&s;ting both of the men and women friends; it being our method, during our labours at the monthly-meetings, to have the company of both &s;exes. Through the over-&s;hadowing of divine power, it was a &s;olemn awful time, of which friends in general appeared to be &s;en&s;ible, as a remarkable &s;tillne&s;s and patience was abode in, for the &s;pace of about &s;ix hours and a half, being the time of the meeting's continuance; though a motion was made &s;ooner for our women friends to withdraw, le&s;t &s;ome weak con&s;titutions might be injured by long &s;itting, &amp;c. yet their &s;pirits being &s;o &s;tayed and bowed down under a &s;en&s;e of heavenly good, they did not accept the liberty given, but con|tinued to the breaking up of the meeting. We found a valuable body of friends in that city, and di&s;cipline, in the main, well &s;upported; yet there appeared great danger of the prevalence of earthly-mindedne&s;s, in &s;ome, and grandeur and wi&s;dom above the &s;implicity of the truth, in others; which, if not guarded again&s;t, might in|trude it&s;elf to act and govern in the church;
<PB N="310" REF="016793_0315_0F9E6A9BB934E5C0">
of which friends were warned, and through the effectual opening of the fountain of wi&s;dom and knowledge, much caution and coun&s;el were admini&s;tered, to mutual edi|fication and comfort. On the 6th of the 2d month we vi&s;ited the monthly-meet|ing of North-Wal&s;ham, where we found an hone&s;t &s;incere remnant concerned to main|tain the principles of truth, by a conduct con&s;i&s;tent therewith; yet a great defection appeared in &s;ome important branches of our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony; the monthly-meeting not having di&s;charged its incumbent duty, by way of admonition and dealing with &s;uch members. Truth opened our way in much plainne&s;s and clo&s;e labour, in order to bring the unfaithful to a right &s;en&s;e of their &s;tates, and to revive and promote our Chri&s;tian di&s;cipline, as a means to re&s;tore ancient beauty, and a good &s;avour among&s;t men. The path of the ju&s;t, in which our worthy predece&s;&s;ors carefully walked, was clearly opened before friends in that meet|ing; the judgment of truth being &s;et over tho&s;e who had erred and &s;trayed therefrom, in this day of outward ea&s;e and liberty. The 9th we vi&s;ited Wells monthly-meet|ing, in which humbling goodne&s;s prevailed, to the great comfort and &s;trength of the upright-hearted; in a living &s;en&s;e of the free extendings whereof, much labour was be&s;towed to re&s;tore good order and di&s;cipline in every part, by fir&s;t endeavouring to re|move
<PB N="311" REF="016793_0316_0F9E6A9C8CF99FF0">
tho&s;e impediments which appeared in the way. It was a time of &s;weet com|fort in a faithful di&s;charge of duty. The 11th we vi&s;ited Lynn monthly-meeting, wherein our &s;pirits were deeply afflicted under a cloud of darkne&s;s, which &s;eemed to over-&s;hadow that meeting, occa&s;ioned by the prevalence of wrong things in many of the members, and their great neglect of the due execution of whole&s;ome di&s;cipline. Much labour was be&s;towed in order for a regulation, but, alas! great weakne&s;s and un&s;kilfulne&s;s appeared; neither was there that openne&s;s to receive help, which we could have de&s;ired in the general; may al&s;o add, we had fre&s;h occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that nothing but an under&s;tanding renewed from above, is capable of labouring &s;ucce&s;sfully for the maintaining our Chri&s;tian di&s;cipline. Oh! that this important point was duly con&s;ider|ed by all active members. The 13th we vi&s;ited the monthly-meeting of Wi&s;beach, in the I&s;le of Ely; it was a &s;mall meeting, as but few members belong thereto. By inquiry, it appeared, &s;lackne&s;s and di&s;or|der had prevailed on &s;ome, and things in general were but low; yet an openne&s;s was felt to receive proper advice and coun&s;el, which, through the gracious extendings of heavenly help, was freely and largely communicated. We had cau&s;e to believe truth was at work in the hearts of a few, in order to prepare them for &s;ervice; hav|ing
<PB N="312" REF="016793_0317_0F9E6A9D9FE9D0A8">
ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction in our labours a|mong&s;t them, and hoping this vi&s;it would prove of con&s;iderable help to that meet|ing. The 17th we vi&s;ited the monthly-meeting at Ives, wherein we had painful labour, and found things much out of order, which had cau&s;ed darkne&s;s to be felt, and an ill-&s;avour; &s;ome of the active members did not appear to us rightly to know what &s;pirits they were of; however, we found they were not one with us in our &s;ervice, which was indeed very clo&s;e and &s;earching to all &s;tations in the church, as it appeared all had need of help, and to look more narrowly to their &s;tanding. Di|vine goodne&s;s was graciou&s;ly with us, and carried us through, to our ea&s;e and &s;atis|faction in a good degree. But, alas! we have &s;ometimes cau&s;e to &s;ee, that our di&s;|cipline does not pro&s;per when managed with un&s;anctified hands. The 18th we vi|&s;ited Hadingham monthly-meeting, and found things very low, as to the life of religion, con&s;equently as to good order and di&s;cipline; yet &s;ome appeared hopeful, tender, and de&s;irous of a proper regulation in the affairs of the church, with whom we had good &s;atisfaction in our labours for their improvement, which I hope was not in vain. The 20th of the 2d month, we, vi&s;ited the monthly-meeting of Roy&s;ton, in Hertford&s;hire; the &s;tate of which appeared much out of order; di&s;cipline was in the
<PB N="313" REF="016793_0318_0F9E6A9DE5379A68">
main neglected. Very deep and painful was our labour, under a mournful &s;en&s;e of that gro&s;s darkne&s;s which had prevailed, by rea&s;on of unfaithfulne&s;s; yet the Lord was graciou&s;ly with us, and the te&s;timony of truth was exalted over the heads of di&s;or|derly walkers, and all tho&s;e, who, by a mean temporizing &s;pirit, had violated &s;ome principal branches of our Chri&s;tian te&s;ti|mony. We were unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that the monthly-meeting of Roy&s;ton, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, was too weak to manage the weighty affairs proper to a monthly-meeting, and therefore propo&s;ed their being joined to Baldock and Hitchin; which, upon a &s;olid deliberation, was agreed to, and hath been &s;ince effected, to the great &s;atisfaction of friends who have the pro&s;|perity of truth at heart. The 23d we vi|&s;ited Hertford monthly-meeting, in which heavenly wi&s;dom and merciful help (as at other places) were largely extended, to the encouragement of a few &s;incere labourers among&s;t them, as well as to the warning and &s;tirring up of carele&s;s, unfaithful pro|fe&s;&s;ors: for indeed, there appeared much &s;lackne&s;s in too many, in not improving tho&s;e talents God had given them. The 24th, we vi&s;ited tho&s;e under our profe&s;&s;ion at Coterhill-head, called a monthly-meet|ing; but, alas! upon inquiry, we found but very little done of the bu&s;ine&s;s proper to a monthly-meeting; neither was it held
<PB N="314" REF="016793_0319_0F9E6A9EA3E9AA20">
in due cour&s;e, but rather occa&s;ionally, for &s;ome particular purpo&s;es; and when the &s;tate of the members appeared, we did not marvel thereat, &s;eeing mo&s;t of them were unfaithful in regard to that important te&s;ti|mony, again&s;t tithes and other anti-chri&s;|tian demands of that nature: other great di&s;orders al&s;o had crept in, nor can any other be rea&s;onably expected, where per|&s;ons are &s;o void of a right under&s;tanding, as to &s;acrifice that noble te&s;timony; they have not &s;trength to maintain other branches in a con&s;i&s;tent efficacious manner, &s;o that where this defection hath prevailed, we have ob&s;erved the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part in religion (among&s;t us as a people) has fallen with it: meetings for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline are neglected, and if &s;ometimes held by &s;uch, they are to little good purpo&s;e; plain|ne&s;s and &s;elf-denial are departed from: this hard, dark, tithe-paying &s;pirit is &s;o blind, as to &s;ee but little in any branch of our te&s;timony, wherein there is a cro&s;s to the carnal mind. Upon &s;olid con&s;ideration we did not think, that u&s;ing endeavours to regulate that meeting, in its &s;ituation at that time, would an&s;wer any good purpo&s;e; but the great thing pointed out to us in the light of truth, was its being di&s;|&s;olved, and that the members thereof might be joined to Hertford monthly-meeting; which had been endeavoured for &s;everal years, both by their quarterly-meeting,
<PB N="315" REF="016793_0320_0F9E6A9F86112D48">
and al&s;o &s;everal committees of the yearly-meeting, which had not, till now, proved &s;ucce&s;sful, as the con&s;ent of mo&s;t of the members could not be obtained&punc; but this meeting, through divine favour, was won|derfully over&s;hadowed with a &s;olemn weight of heavenly power, which awed and tender|ed their &s;pirits, and at the &s;ame time merci|fully enabled us clearly to demon&s;trate, that they contended only for the name of a monthly-meeting; &s;eeing the &s;ervice of &s;uch a meeting was not an&s;wered, &s;carcely in any in&s;tance. They at length generally yielded, and a minute was made to propo&s;e a junction with Hertford, which is &s;ince effected, to the great ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction of friends. I cannot well avoid remarking here, the very great hurt and ob&s;truction to the progre&s;s of truth, which I have divers times, with &s;orrow of heart, ob|&s;erved to ari&s;e by &s;ome active members from private views, &s;trenuou&s;ly with|&s;tanding the pointings of divine wi&s;dom, for the help and pre&s;ervation of the body, which doubtle&s;s is in the Lord's &s;ight, a crime of a very offen&s;ive nature; therefore all &s;hould greatly dread being in any degree guilty thereof. Let us therefore, at all times, carefully examine what ground we act upon in the church of God, whe|ther we always pre&s;erve the &s;ingle eye, being cloathed with that pure charity which &s;eeketh not her own, and filled with that
<PB N="316" REF="016793_0321_0F9E6AA022E38C90">
univer&s;al &s;pirit, that carefully promotes the good of the whole, without re&s;pect of per|&s;ons. The 25th we vi&s;ited Hitchin month|ly-meeting, where we found a valuable &s;olid body of friends, and di&s;cipline well maintained in mo&s;t of its branches. Hea|venly goodne&s;s over-&s;hadowed that meeting, whereby under&s;tanding was given to admi|ni&s;ter &s;uitable caution and coun&s;el; particu|larly to point out the great danger of &s;itting down at ea&s;e, in a becoming decent form, even after being eminently favoured, both with the dew of heaven and the fatne&s;s of the earth; notwith&s;tanding which, there mu&s;t be a per&s;evering in an earne&s;t labour for daily bread, &s;eeing nothing be|yond this can be attained by us, whil&s;t in a militant &s;tate. On the 27th we vi&s;ited the monthly-meeting of Ampthill, in Bed|ford&s;hire, the Lord's awful pre&s;ence being near, as, through infinite mercy, was gene|rally the ca&s;e; this opened the way for a clo&s;e and diligent inquiry into the &s;tate of that meeting. Things appeared low and pretty much out of order; the active mem|bers having here, as in many other places, too much neglected a deep and painful la|bour for a better regulation. Endeavours were u&s;ed, in order to &s;tir up and provoke to love and good works, by diligently ex|tending a care over the whole flock, that &s;o all might be brought into the comely order of the go&s;pel. On the 28th we vi&s;it|ed
<PB N="317" REF="016793_0322_0F9E6AA10A8C41A0">
Luton monthly-meeting; it was &s;mall, &s;lackne&s;s and the want of right zeal ap|peared; al&s;o &s;ome di&s;orders crept in, yet there &s;eemed openne&s;s in the minds of friends to receive advice and coun&s;el, which, through divine aid, were largely admini&s;tered; and I hope the labour of that day was beneficial to divers of the mem|bers, and may prove a la&s;ting advantage to that meeting. The 2d of the 3d month, we vi&s;ited Alban's monthly-meeting, held at Charley-wood, where, on the u&s;ual in|quiries, things appeared very low and much out of order; yet divine favour was largely and livingly extended for their help and re|covery; in an humble &s;en&s;e whereof, much endeavours were u&s;ed to promote a better regulation; fir&s;t, by the active members taking heed to them&s;elves, that they might be endued with ancient zeal and fervour of mind; then they would take the over-&s;ight of the flock, not by con&s;traint, but willing|ly: this willingne&s;s, through a neglect of &s;eeking that divine power which alone can bring it forth in the mind of man, hath been much lo&s;t or departed from, by many, and appears to be greatly wanting in mo&s;t places; this, without doubt, is one prin|cipal cau&s;e that &s;o general a defection hath prevailed. Had the foremo&s;t rank &s;tood faithful in the authority of truth, they would have been as a bulwark again&s;t undue liberties, and happy in&s;truments to have
<PB N="318" REF="016793_0323_0F9E6AA1A0833E00">
pre&s;erved the body healthy, and in beautiful order. But, oh! how &s;hall I &s;et forth, and &s;ufficiently admire, the marvellous con|de&s;cen&s;ion of infinite goodne&s;s, which &s;o eminently manife&s;ted it&s;elf in all the meet|ings we were concerned to vi&s;it, in order to bring back again the captivity of his people, to build up the wa&s;te places, and to beauti|fy the hou&s;e of his glory. May &s;uch evi|dent tokens of his merciful regard make deep and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions on all minds, le&s;t the Lord be ju&s;tly provoked to ca&s;t many off, and move &s;uch to jealou&s;y by tho&s;e who are now no people. One very &s;orrowful in&s;tance of much degeneracy, be|ing an inlet for many other wrong things to creep into our &s;ociety, was the great neglect of divine wor&s;hip, e&s;pecially on week days; &s;ome week-day meetings being wholly drop|ped, and in many places where they are kept up, attended by few; and by what ap|pears, many do not &s;eem to think it their duty to attend them at all, nor even fir&s;t-day meetings, when &s;mall difficulties pre&s;ent. This di&s;covers remarkable ignorance of the great importance of that indi&s;pen&s;able duty, as well as of the great need all have, of a daily &s;upply from the Lord's bountiful hand. As the&s;e opportunities of inward retirement and humble bowing before God, have, by experience, been found times of un&s;peak|able refre&s;hment, which flows from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, who has graciou&s;ly
<PB N="319" REF="016793_0324_0F9E6AA512FB0DF8">
promi&s;ed to be with tho&s;e who meet in his name, even where the numbers are but two or three, hereby &s;trength is admini&s;tered, which enables us to &s;tand our ground in the Chri&s;tian warfare. It is no marvel there|fore, that the neglect of &s;o important a duty, is a cau&s;e of much weakne&s;s, de|priving people of a nece&s;&s;ary defence again&s;t numerous and potent enemies which war again&s;t the &s;oul. Here he that goes about like a roaring lion, and al&s;o as a creeping &s;ubtil &s;erpent, prevails, in order to lay the &s;ociety wa&s;te; and whil&s;t many are a&s;leep in carnal &s;ecurity, he finds opportunity to &s;ow tares among&s;t the wheat. Very deep and &s;ervent were our labours in this vi&s;it, to promote diligence in this mo&s;t import|ant duty, as a great means, under the divine ble&s;&s;ing, for the re&s;toring ancient beauty and comeline&s;s throughout the &s;ociety. This opportunity at Charley-wood, fini&s;hed our pre&s;ent vi&s;it to monthly-meetings; we having reque&s;ted the quarterly-meeting to which they belonged, to adjourn, in &s;uch order, as to be vi&s;ited in cour&s;e by us at one journey, to begin in Luton, for Bed|ford&s;hire, which accordingly was held the 8th of the 4th month, 1761, John Emms, Thomas Corbyn, Samuel Scott, Jo&s;eph Row, and my&s;elf attended the &s;ame, and laid before the quarterly meeting, in writing, the &s;tate of their monthly-meetings, as the &s;ame ap|peared to us by their an&s;wers to the quar|terly-meeting
<PB N="320" REF="016793_0325_0F9E6AA62132F660">
queries, and other inquiries made in our late vi&s;it, with &s;undry remarks thereon; and through the over-&s;hadowing of heavenly power, we were fervently con|cerned to bring the weight of the declined &s;tate of the &s;ociety there, upon the meet|ing, wherein an engagement of mind was revived for a reformation: may the &s;ame continue and increa&s;e. On the 10th of the 4th month we vi&s;ited Hertford quarter|ly-meeting; where our friend Jo&s;eph Tay|lor, who had been indi&s;po&s;ed, joined us. Having previou&s;ly drawn up the &s;tate of their monthly-meetings, as the &s;ame ap|peared to us in our late vi&s;it, with re|marks thereon, we laid it before the meet|ing, which they took into their &s;olid con|&s;ideration, and a &s;olemn time it was: the Lord's power being livingly felt, it made a remnant willing to ari&s;e, that the breaches made in that excellent hedge of di&s;cipline, &s;et by divine wi&s;dom about us as a people, might be repaired; that the heritage be not laid wa&s;te. On the 14th of the 4th month, we vi&s;ited the quarterly-meeting at Ives, for Huntington&s;hire, Cambridge&s;hire, and the I&s;le of Ely; where, having drawn up the &s;tate of their monthly-meetings, as the &s;ame appeared to us in our late vi&s;it, with &s;ome remarks thereon, we laid the &s;ame before them, with earne&s;t labour to awaken the active members, to a lively &s;en&s;e of the &s;orrowful declen&s;ion found within
<PB N="321" REF="016793_0326_0F9E6AA6E46903B0">
their borders. It was a painful exerci&s;ing time, great in&s;en&s;ibility having prevailed over many; yet I believe it was a &s;ea&s;on of comfort and relief to a living remnant, who travail for the pro&s;perity of truth a|mong&s;t them; may their number increa&s;e! We had the returns of &s;weet peace in the di&s;charge of our duty, and departed with chearfulne&s;s of mind. On the 21&s;t of the 4th month, we vi&s;ited the quarterly-meet|ing for the county of Norfolk, held in the city of Norwich; where, as u&s;ual, having drawn up the &s;tate of their month|ly meetings, with remarks thereon, the &s;ame was &s;olidly laid before the meeting; wherein divine goodne&s;s was manife&s;ted; in the wi&s;dom and &s;trength whereof much earne&s;t labour was be&s;towed, in order that all, the active members e&s;pecially, might be &s;tirred up to an exertion of godly endea|vours, for re&s;toring comely order and di&s;|cipline, in divers very weak meetings with|in their county; not to be at ea&s;e in their ceiled hou&s;es, whil&s;t the ark of the te&s;ti|mony of God was expo&s;ed to reproach, by the defection of many under the &s;ame pro|fe&s;&s;ion. It was a good time, and I hope &s;erviceable to &s;ome; yet we could not help lamenting, that the memorable opportu|nity we lately had at Norwich monthly-meeting had not made greater impre&s;&s;ion than appeared by &s;ome not very agreeable in|&s;tances in this meeting, relating to their
<PB N="322" REF="016793_0327_0F9E6AA7A1BD92C0">
fully uniting for the county's help, as there was apparent nece&s;&s;ity for the &s;ame. The 24th of the 4th month, we vi&s;ited the quarterly-meeting of Suffolk held at Wood|bridge, and laid before them in writing the &s;tate of their monthly-meetings, as the &s;ame appeared to us in our late vi&s;it, with &s;ome remarks thereon. Much labour was be&s;towed in the free extendings of divine love, which was comfortably &s;hed abroad in that meeting, that friends might be thereby &s;tirred up to u&s;e endeavours for a general reformation, in which fervent la|bour was be&s;towed, and clo&s;e admonition extended to &s;uch as knew not their own &s;pirits &s;ubjected by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, but dared to pre&s;ume to move and act in the affairs of the church of God, by the &s;trength of their own under&s;tandings as men: the&s;e, not having true zeal, can wink at wrong things, great di&s;orders, and flagrant unfaithfulne&s;s, &s;moothing all over, and blending all together deceitfully, crying Peace, and all is well, when it is evidently otherwi&s;e. Oh, how doth the Lord abhor &s;uch un&s;oundne&s;s! &s;urely then his people &s;hould &s;ee the weight and authority of his power &s;tanding over &s;uch. A principal cau&s;e of de&s;olation and wa&s;te in the hou&s;e and heritage of God, is the want of more prepared &s;tones for the building, hewn and poli&s;hed in the moun|tain. But great inconveniency ari&s;es, when &s;ome are made u&s;e of as &s;tones for the
<PB N="323" REF="016793_0328_0F9E6AA8618DF740">
building, in their natural &s;tate, which ren|ders them unfit materials to erect a hou&s;e for the glory of God to abide in; &s;o that what &s;uch build, is nothing but a habita|tion for anti-chri&s;t to dwell in; for he will content him&s;elf in any form of religion, whil&s;t he can keep the power out of it. His fir&s;t &s;ubtile working in the my&s;tery of iniquity is, to per&s;uade the minds of men, there is no need of any more power and wi&s;|dom than they have as men; that if they will exert their endeavour, they may be u&s;eful members; thus withdrawing gra|dually from the fountain of living water, to hew out ci&s;terns to them&s;elves which will hold no water. Oh, how dry and in&s;ipid are all their religious performances! and what they do, is only to beget in their own image, carnal lifele&s;s profe&s;&s;ors like them|&s;elves; the&s;e are very apt to be doing, being always furni&s;hed; but the true la|bourers mu&s;t, in every meeting, and upon all occa&s;ions that offer for &s;ervice, receive &s;upernatural aid and the renewed under|&s;tanding, by the immediate de&s;cendings of heavenly wi&s;dom and power, or they dare not meddle. Where there are but two or three in each monthly-meeting, carefully abiding in an holy dependance upon God, to be fur|ni&s;hed for his work, great things may be done by his mighty power, in and through them. This is evident, by ob&s;erving the &s;tate of meetings where &s;uch dwell, though

all is not done they could ardently de&s;ire, as prai&s;ed be the Lord, there are many yet up and down, who know and experimentally feel their &s;ufficiency for every &s;ervice in the church to be of God. The 28th of the 4th month, we attended the quarterly-meeting I belong to, held at Cogge&s;hall, for the county of E&s;&s;ex. Having drawn up the &s;tate of the &s;everal monthly-meetings in writing, with remarks thereon, it was laid before this meeting; much &s;olid and weighty endeavours being u&s;ed for a gene|ral reformation, by the earne&s;t labour of our friends on the vi&s;it, which was very edifying and comfortable to the hone&s;t-hearted among&s;t us. We drew up a &s;um|mary account of the &s;tate of the &s;ociety in the counties before-mentioned, and our &s;a|tisfaction in that &s;olemn undertaking; with thankful acknowledgment of the Lord's gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tance through the whole, which was read in the yearly-meeting, 1761. Be|fore I clo&s;e this account, it may not be ami&s;s to &s;ay, that &s;uch was the effect of our labours in mo&s;t or all the monthly-meet|ings, that committees were appointed of their own members, to vi&s;it particular meetings, and al&s;o individual members, for their help, as occa&s;ion might require. The quarterly-meetings al&s;o appointed large committees to vi&s;it their monthly-meet|ings and others, as they found freedom, for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. A few days after the
<PB N="325" REF="016793_0330_0F9E6AA9E08B7F48">
yearly-meeting in London, 1761, Thomas Corbyn, Jo&s;eph Row, and my&s;elf, &s;et out, in company with divers other friends, on their return from the yearly-meeting, in order to vi&s;it the monthly and quarterly-meetings of friends in York&s;hire, Lincoln|&s;hire, Nottingham&s;hire, Derby&s;hire, and Leice&s;ter&s;hire; Matthew Mellor joined us at Oatby, near Leice&s;ter; Jo&s;eph Taylor having concluded to meet us in York&s;hire. On the 24th of the 5th month, we vi&s;ited Balby monthly-meeting, held at Sheffield, and found, to our comfort, a living body of friends therein; yet much &s;lackne&s;s and defection appeared in many members or mo&s;t ranks. Truth opened and largely furni&s;hed with wi&s;dom and &s;trength, to lay before them the dangerous con&s;equence of &s;ome prevailing and undue liberties. Tho&s;e advanced in age and profe&s;&s;ion, were intreated and laboured with in much ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, to be more zealous and diligent, in a godly care over them&s;elves and the flock; as tho&s;e that mu&s;t &s;hortly give an account to the great &s;hepherd. The 25th we vi&s;ited Pontefract monthly-meeting, held at Highflats. Here was a very numerous body of friends, who&s;e outward appearance was very becoming our &s;elf-denying pro|fe&s;&s;ion; and I really believe this plainne&s;s, in a con&s;iderable number among&s;t them, was the genuine product of a well regu|lated mind; yet I fear, in too many, it was
<PB N="326" REF="016793_0331_0F9E6AAD32AED2B0">
more the effect of education, which, however, I would not condemn, where people are not prevailed upon by the &s;ubtilty of Satan to take their re&s;t therein; &s;ince the form mu&s;t follow the power, and not the power fol|low the form. We had clo&s;e labour, in order to rou&s;e tho&s;e who had &s;ettled down in a fal&s;e re&s;t, and al&s;o to promote a better regulation in &s;ome re&s;pects; yet I think it might be &s;aid that di&s;cipline, in mo&s;t of its branches, was pretty well maintained in that meeting. It was a time of high favour; coun&s;el and admonition were plen|tifully extended. The 27th we vi&s;ited Brighou&s;e monthly-meeting, held at Brad|ford: here Jonathan Raine and William Hird joined us. This meeting was exceeding large; &s;ome &s;lackne&s;s and defection appeared, yet in the main, di&s;cipline and good order were well &s;upported, in divers branches. This was indeed a time of &s;ignal &s;avour, as the canopy of divine power and love over&s;ha|dowed this large a&s;&s;embly, wherein much fervent labour was extended, that all might be brought into, and pre&s;erved in, that humble &s;elf-denying way which leads to la&s;ting peace and happine&s;s; and that none might re&s;t &s;atisfied in a form of religion, without the daily quickenings of heavenly life, whereby only the daily &s;acrifice can be offered, and the abomination that makes de&s;olate kept out of the holy places, viz. the heart of man made and pre&s;erved holy
<PB N="327" REF="016793_0332_0F9E6AAE05F7F058">
by the powerful pre&s;ence of God; no lon|ger can it be &s;o, than his pre&s;ence is there. The 29th we vi&s;ited Knare&s;borough month|ly-meeting, held at Rawden. This was al&s;o very large, perhaps near five hundred of both &s;exes attended, and near as many at each of the before-mentioned meetings. Here we found a weighty, &s;olid body of friends, who were zealou&s;ly concerned to pre&s;erve di&s;cipline and good order on its ancient bottom; yet there was al&s;o a very heavy, clogging, lifele&s;s body, at re&s;t in a profe&s;&s;ion, in whom little or no living con|cern appeared, to keep undue liberties out of their families, and to &s;hew exemplary diligence in religious duties. Divine good|ne&s;s, as at other times, was eminently mani|fe&s;ted, in which, abundance of &s;ound ad|vice, caution, and coun&s;el, were freely ad|mini&s;tered, wherewith many hearts were deeply affected, being made willing to ari&s;e, in order to promote a reformation where things appeared out of order. The 1&s;t of the 6th month, we vi&s;ited Settle monthly-meeting; a laborious exerci&s;ing time it was, in a deep and painful &s;en&s;e of the numbne&s;s and formality of too many members, and the great decay of primitive zeal; yet, through the merciful ari&s;ing of heavenly power and wi&s;dom, ability was received to admini&s;ter &s;uitable advice, warning, and coun&s;el, in order to awaken the carele&s;s, lukewarm profe&s;&s;ors, as well as to extend
<PB N="328" REF="016793_0333_0F9E6AAF14A00F50">
comfort and relief for the encouragement of a &s;incerely concerned remnant among&s;t them; that &s;o, what appeared out of the holy order of the go&s;pel, might be regulated. The 3d of the 6th month, we vi&s;ited Richmond monthly-meeting, held at Ai&s;|garth; the number of members here was very con&s;iderable, yet the life of religion &s;eemed at a low ebb; that &s;orrowful mi&s;take, of imagining them&s;elves God's people with|out the real &s;en&s;e of the indwelling of his holy &s;pirit, and of being the children of A|braham without the faith and good works of Abraham, having, I fear, very much pre|vailed upon the po&s;terity of faithful wor|thies who are gone to their re&s;t. In tho&s;e parts, great &s;lackne&s;s and defection in &s;ome very important re&s;pects appeared in many, who, through the powerful efficacy of the everla&s;ting word, were clo&s;ely and very pre&s;&s;ingly admoni&s;hed to more care and diligence. Great endeavours were u&s;ed, that our Chri&s;tian di&s;cipline might be more duly put in practice; a living remnant a|mong&s;t them&s;elves, heartily joining with us in our deep labours for promoting that &s;alutary end. The 5th, Thir&s;k monthly-meeting was vi&s;ited by us; Jo&s;eph Taylor joining us here. We were now &s;even in number, which we did not find too many, the work we were engaged in being very weighty and laborious. In this meeting, a remnant were &s;incerely concerned to main|tain
<PB N="329" REF="016793_0334_0F9E6AAF20F2A970">
di&s;cipline and good order, in the &s;pirit and life thereof; yet great lukewarmne&s;s and many deficiencies appeared; an earthly carnal &s;pirit having much the a&s;cendency in parents; rawne&s;s, in&s;en&s;ibility, and a de|viation from plainne&s;s, in divers of the youth; which cau&s;ed us deep and painful labour; yet, through the de&s;cending of heavenly virtue, we were enabled to &s;peak clo&s;ely to their &s;tates, which, I hope, had a good effect on &s;ome of them. This op|portunity afforded much relief to our &s;pi|rits, and we went away with peace. The 8th we vi&s;ited Gi&s;borough monthly-meet|ing, held at Kirbymoor&s;ide; where a very large number of members attended, with an outward appearance becoming our holy profe&s;&s;ion, and we found a truly concerned remnant among&s;t them: but at this, as well as at other places, we had, with &s;orrow of heart, to view the great de&s;olation that an enemy had made in the time of outward ea&s;e and liberty, which could not prevail upon our worthy predece&s;&s;ors, by depriving them of their liberty, in jails and &s;tinking dungeons, &s;eparation by bani&s;hment and otherwi&s;e, of tho&s;e in the neare&s;t ties and con|nexion of life; nay, the lo&s;s of all their out|ward &s;ub&s;tance, and the lives of many, could not deter them from maintaining their te&s;ti|mony for God in public wor&s;hip, and other things; yet he hath mightily prevailed on many of their incon&s;iderate offspring, who
<PB N="330" REF="016793_0335_0F9E6AAFEBB76030">
&s;eem to have very little be&s;ides the hu&s;k left to feed upon. Divine goodne&s;s was wonderfully extended, in which much fer|vent labour was be&s;towed, and an awaken|ing time it was. The foundation of the builders upon the &s;and was &s;haken, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the everla&s;ting rock and &s;ure foundation, was exalted, as the only &s;afe re&s;t and defence of his people. The 11th we vi&s;ited Malton monthly-meeting; the &s;tate whereof appeared very low, and things relating to our di&s;cipline much out of order; divine goodne&s;s being near, our minds were &s;trengthened, and our mouths opened, in earne&s;t endeavours for their help and recovery; a &s;mall remnant among&s;t them&s;elves joining with us herein. I hope it was a profitable time to &s;ome. The 13th we vi&s;ited Scarborough monthly-meeting, held at Whitby, where, although we found a &s;incere remnant with whom we had unity in &s;pirit, and they had a &s;atisfactory &s;en&s;e of our clo&s;e and earne&s;t labours in that meeting; yet many under the &s;ame pro|fe&s;&s;ion were greatly back&s;lidden, and revolted from the primitive power and purity of that undefiled religion, which the faithful among&s;t us have been, and are led into: divine coun&s;el was eminently manife&s;ted, in order to heal their back&s;liding, and to bring them into a due &s;en&s;e of the weight and great importance of tho&s;e te&s;timonies to the ble&s;&s;ed truth, given to us as a people to
<PB N="331" REF="016793_0336_0F9E6AB0A9326300">
bear, which made good impre&s;&s;ion on &s;ome; but others &s;eemed at &s;o great a di&s;tance, that it was hard to make them rightly &s;en&s;ible of their true intere&s;t. We departed from thence with ea&s;e and peace of mind. The 14th, Bridlington monthly-meeting was held, which was very &s;mall, and the life of religion very low; but little ability and judgment to manage the affairs of the church appeared; it was therefore our opi|nion, they were too weak to &s;ub&s;i&s;t honour|ably as a monthly-meeting, and that it would promote the general good, to join them to &s;ome other monthly-meeting. The 17th, Ou&s;twick monthly-meeting was held at Hull. Upon the u&s;ual inquiries it appeared, that much lukewarmne&s;s and defection had crept in; and for want of a godly zeal in mo&s;t of the active members, di&s;cipline had not been &s;trictly and impar|tially maintained, &s;o that darkne&s;s and weak|ne&s;s had prevailed. In this mournful &s;tate of things, our labours were painful and exerci&s;ing; yet, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the te&s;timony of truth in its &s;everal branch|es was exalted, and judgment &s;et upon tho&s;e who had violated the &s;ame. The few &s;incere-hearted labourers among&s;t them were earne&s;tly advi&s;ed and encouraged to bear the ark of the te&s;timony of the Lord as upon their &s;houlders, in the people's &s;ight, which I hope had a good effect. The 19th, we vi&s;ited the monthly-meet|ing
<PB N="332" REF="016793_0337_0F9E6AB1A648FAC8">
of Cave. The appearance of the mem|bers was plain, yet we found great dead|ne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility among&s;t them, which mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, where people are content|ed in an empty form of religion, without the power of it. Much Chri&s;tian labour was be&s;towed in order to kindle a living zeal; but, alas! little impre&s;&s;ion was made on &s;ome, yet I hope this vi&s;it was of con|&s;iderable &s;ervice to others, and may tend to general benefit; but all the increa&s;e is of the Lord. The 21&s;t we vi&s;ited York monthly-meeting, wherein appeared much want of a lively &s;en&s;e of truth on the minds of active members, and divers deficiencies and &s;ome di&s;orders, had crept in, and re|mained, by a neglect of proper dealing, and an exerci&s;e of &s;ound judgment. Here we had cau&s;e to &s;ee, as well as at many other places, that a literal knowledge of our di&s;|cipline, without heavenly life influencing the minds of tho&s;e exerci&s;ed therein, bring|eth nothing effectually to pa&s;s, to God's glory, and the edification of his church and people. Great and deep was our labour, under a weighty &s;en&s;e of the divine power, and al&s;o of the low, languid &s;tate of the church in this city, de&s;iring &s;he might be favoured to ari&s;e and &s;hake her&s;elf from the du&s;t of the earth, &s;trengthening the things which remain. This fini&s;hed our vi&s;its to the monthly-meetings in this coun|ty; and though I have not particularly
<PB N="333" REF="016793_0338_0F9E6AB27B5A0010">
mentioned the opportunities taken by us in &s;elect meetings of mini&s;ters and elders, yet we had &s;uch opportunities in mo&s;t or all the monthly-meetings; where their queries were read and an&s;wered; advice, caution, coun&s;el, and reproof al&s;o, were admini&s;tered as we found our&s;elves led and influenced thereunto. The 24th of the 6th month, their quarterly-meeting was held in York. We had drawn up the &s;tate of their monthly-meetings, being fourteen in num|ber, as the &s;ame appeared to us from their an&s;wers to the u&s;ual queries, and other in|quiries made by us in our late vi&s;it to them, with &s;undry remarks thereon, particularly on the great and mournful &s;lackne&s;s in, and neglect of, divine wor&s;hip; e&s;pecially on week-days, which di&s;covers an indifference and lukewarmne&s;s much to be lamented. Earne&s;t labour was be&s;towed in that great meeting, to fa&s;ten the weight and great im|portance of qualified members, coming more earne&s;tly and feelingly under a deep &s;en&s;e of the care of the churches; that &s;o an increa&s;e of zeal and diligence may be exer|ci&s;ed throughout; in warning the unruly, comforting the feeble-minded, and in &s;up|porting the weak. It was a &s;olemn time, the members being &s;en&s;ibly affected with the great need of a better regulation in di|vers re&s;pects; a large committee was ap|pointed to vi&s;it and a&s;&s;i&s;t the monthly, al&s;o particular meetings, as they &s;aw cau&s;e, in
<PB N="334" REF="016793_0339_0F9E6AB32BDFEF00">
order to help forward the nece&s;&s;ary work of reformation. The monthly-meetings al&s;o, except one, in con&s;equence of our vi&s;it appointed committees to vi&s;it particular meetings and individuals, as their way might open, for the better putting in prac|tice our Chri&s;tian di&s;cipline. In this city, our friend John Hunt of London, joined us; and here we parted with Jonathan Raine, Matthew Mellor, and William Hird. We went next into Lincoln&s;hire, and on the 29th of the 6th month, vi&s;ited their monthly-meeting, held at Gain&s;borough: here John Oxley of Norwich met us. Things appeared very low and defective, as to the di&s;cipline and good order of the church in this place; the members, in too general a way, being by indifference and weakne&s;s, in&s;en&s;ible of its great worth and u&s;efulne&s;s. Our &s;pirits were deeply bap|tized into a &s;en&s;e of their &s;tates, and we re|ceived ability, with great plainne&s;s to lay before them the dangerous con&s;equence of &s;uch an un&s;avoury unfruitful condition, and the great duty which the members of &s;o|ciety owed to God, them&s;elves, and to one another, in a religious capacity, which for the pre&s;ent &s;eemed to affect their minds; may the impre&s;&s;ion be la&s;ting! We had al&s;o &s;ome things to offer by way of encourage|ment, to a few &s;incere, though weak ones among&s;t them. The 2d of the 7th month, we vi&s;ited Wainfleet monthly-meeting, find|ing
<PB N="335" REF="016793_0340_0F9E6AB40A383218">
things di&s;tre&s;&s;ingly low and much out of order; and but few who had the cau&s;e of truth at heart, &s;o as to mourn becau&s;e of the great de&s;olation and wa&s;te made in the &s;ociety there, by earthly-mindedne&s;s and other fle&s;hly liberties. Our minds were deeply engaged that truth might break through, and &s;often the minds of tho&s;e dry, carnal profe&s;&s;ors, who, in&s;tead of help|ing forward the nece&s;&s;ary work of di&s;ci|pline, were great clogs and hinderances thereunto, being as dead weights and bur|dens on the more lively part of the body. Through the holy efficacy of that pure life, which graciou&s;ly attended us from place to place, we were enabled to di&s;|charge our con&s;ciences at that meeting, in much plain-dealing, to our own peace and the comfort and relief of the few up|right-hearted there. The 4th we vi&s;ited Spalding monthly-meeting; much di&s;order and &s;lackne&s;s appeared al&s;o at this meeting, in &s;ome; others, who would &s;eem to be &s;omething in religion, were but too much like the unfruitful fig-tree, on which, when it came to be nearly examined, nothing was to be found but leaves; having, like Ephraim and Demas, for&s;aken the dew and tenderne&s;s of their youth, and embraced this pre&s;ent world. Such, though they re|tain &s;omething of the outward re&s;emblance, cannot pro&s;per in religion, as they are dry and in&s;ipid. in this low, mournful &s;tate
<PB N="336" REF="016793_0341_0F9E6AB460903268">
of things, truth aro&s;e, and furni&s;hed with &s;uitable matter and utterance, in plain deal|ing with formal profe&s;&s;ors, and proper en|couragement to &s;ome hopeful youth and others, to come up in a more lively zeal and concern for God's cau&s;e, than had been maintained of late at that meeting, which I hope was of good &s;ervice. The 6th we vi&s;ited Lincoln monthly-meeting, held at Broughton. This meeting appeared in a very low condition, as to a lively &s;en&s;e of truth; con&s;equently, the di&s;cipline thereof was not rightly managed, as being done too much in the will, wi&s;dom, and temper of man. Some appeared hopeful and tender, e&s;pecially of a younger rank, to whom, I hope, our deep and earne&s;t labour among&s;t them was profitable.</P>
<P>The 8th of the 7th month, the quarterly-meeting was held at Lincoln; before which we laid in writing, the languid and di&s;or|derly &s;tate of the &s;ociety in that county, with &s;undry clo&s;e remarks thereon, point|ing out, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the cau&s;e of the great declen&s;ion found among&s;t them. This was accompained with our joint and earne&s;t endeavours, to bring the weight of tho&s;e things upon the members, that they might feel a proper engagement of mind to ari&s;e, and repair the breaches made, which had a good effect on &s;ome minds, and a committee was appointed in order to promote the work of reformation; which was al&s;o done
<PB N="337" REF="016793_0342_0F9E6AB759868FA8">
at mo&s;t, or all their monthly-meetings. From Lincoln, John Hunt and Jo&s;eph Row returned home to London, and John Oxley to Norwich; Thomas Corbyn, Jo&s;eph Taylor, and my&s;elf, went into Not|tingham&s;hire. The 13th of the 7th month we vi&s;ited Retford monthly-meeting, as it was called, wherein we found a few tender and hopeful, and had &s;ome openne&s;s to ad|mini&s;ter coun&s;el and advice, tending to their help and improvement, which appear|ed to be well received, and &s;ome minds were affected therewith; yet very little was di&s;|covered by us of di&s;cipline being put in prac|tice, but almo&s;t every thing relating there|to was neglected. It therefore was our judgment they ought to be joined to &s;ome other monthly-meeting, yet their &s;ituation rendered that &s;omewhat difficult; however, we concluded to lay the ca&s;e before their en&s;uing quarterly-meeting. The 14th we vi&s;ited Mansfield monthly-meeting, which al&s;o appeared very low and weak; but very little of the bu&s;ine&s;s of a monthly-meeting properly done, as the number was very &s;mall that generally attended them, and in mo&s;t of them the e&s;&s;ential qualification for &s;ervice in the church of Chri&s;t much want|ing. It was therefore our judgment, that it would be for the general good, that Man&s;|field monthly-meeting &s;hould be joined to that of Che&s;terfield, except Oxon particular meet|ing; which from its &s;ituation might better
<PB N="338" REF="016793_0343_0F9E6AB87556E458">
be joined to Nottingham. The 15th we vi&s;it|ed Che&s;terfield monthly-meeting, wherein divine goodne&s;s was livingly manife&s;ted, in order to admini&s;ter proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by way of advice, coun&s;el, and encouragement, to this &s;mall, weak meeting, wherein di&s;ci|pline, in divers of its branches, was much neglected; yet there appeared an openne&s;s in the members to be in&s;tructed and help|ed forward in that weighty work, which, through the &s;trength and efficacy of divine love, was largely extended to them, in which we had &s;atisfaction of mind. The 16th we went to Breach, called a monthly-meeting, but we found it, in that re&s;pect, almo&s;t de&s;olate. The te&s;timony of truth, &s;o precious to their ance&s;tors in that place, was by them &s;uffered to fall, in mo&s;t of its branches; but few of tho&s;e who were active members, appeared clear in its &s;upport. Darkne&s;s had greatly prevailed over their minds, yet our deep labour, under the in|fluence of heavenly good, had a tendering effect upon &s;ome of them. One thing aimed at by us, was, that the members of that meeting might be joined to the monthly-meeting of Nottingham, they being unfit to remain in their pre&s;ent condition, which was con&s;ented to by them, a minute made, and &s;ome of their members appointed to propo&s;e the &s;ame to Nottingham meet|ing. The 17th we vi&s;ited Nottingham monthly-meeting; the number here was
<PB N="339" REF="016793_0344_0F9E6AB8E345FFB0">
pretty large, but the pure virtue of heaven|ly goodne&s;s, (without the &s;en&s;ible experi|ence whereof there can be no pro&s;perity in the truth,) &s;eemed to be much depre&s;&s;ed and ob&s;tructed by earthly-mindedne&s;s, cover|ed over with a form of religion in &s;ome heads of families, by whom undue liberties were winked at in their offspring: &s;uch not having zeal enough to &s;uppre&s;s wrong things in their own families, are not like to pro|mote good order and di&s;cipline in the church. We found &s;ome who united with us in a deep and earne&s;t labour for a better regulation, and much &s;ound admonition, caution, and coun&s;el, were admini&s;tered, which &s;eemed (at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent) to have an awakening effect on &s;ome. On the 20th of the 7th month the quarterly-meet|ing was held at Nottingham, and, as we un|der&s;tood, a junction of that, and the quar|terly-meeting of Derby&s;hire, was agreed on between them, and &s;hortly to be complet|ed. We drew up the &s;tate of the monthly-meetings in both the &s;aid counties, as the &s;ame appeared to us in our late vi&s;it, with &s;undry remarks on the mournful declen&s;ion found among&s;t them; pointing out to them, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, what we apprehended to have been the cau&s;e thereof, that tho&s;e con|cerned might both examine them&s;elves and be more watchful, in order to prevent &s;uch con&s;equences for the future: which was read in this meeting, and endeavours

u&s;ed verbally al&s;o, that the meeting might come under a &s;olid &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate of their monthly-meetings, that proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance might be extended for a general reforma|tion. But, alas! there were but few among&s;t them enough devoted, heartily to engage in &s;o good and nece&s;&s;ary a work; however, we were enabled to clear our&s;elves, by leaving the weight of things upon them, and to depart with ea&s;e and &s;weet peace of mind. All prai&s;es and humble thank&s;giv|ings to our holy head, for his gracious and comfortable &s;upport, in our deep exerci&s;es and labour from place to place. For, alas! we &s;hould &s;oon have fainted under the weight of that painful &s;ervice, had he been plea&s;ed to withdraw, even but for a little time; but we found him a never-failing fountain of all we &s;tood in need of, and when our &s;ervice for this time was over, we could not &s;ay we lacked any thing. The 21&s;t of the 7th month we vi&s;ited Ca&s;tle-Dunington monthly-meeting in Leice&s;ter|&s;hire, wherein divine favour was largely extended, in which we received &s;trength to labour earne&s;tly, for the reviving of a living concern in the members, that di&s;cipline and good order might be better maintained, which, through the indifference of &s;ome, and the backward, cowardly di&s;po&s;ition of others, was but poorly &s;upported in &s;un|dry re&s;pects; yet this opportunity &s;eemed to have a good effect, by a con&s;iderable

reach upon many of their minds, and I hope may prove of great advantage to that meet|ing, as the members thereof &s;eemed rather weak than wilful. The 24th we vi&s;ited Hinkley monthly-meeting, which, as to the &s;upport of di&s;cipline and go&s;pel order, appeared to us almo&s;t de&s;olate. Our earne&s;t labour for their help and recovery had little vi&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion on &s;ome of their members, the in&s;en&s;ibility was &s;o great; though others were awakened to a degree of feeling and tenderne&s;s, who, I hope, received &s;ome benefit thereby, The be&s;t expedient that appeared to us, was their being joined to Leice&s;ter monthly-meeting, which was accordingly recommended. The 25th we vi&s;ited Dalby monthly-meeting; and as it appeared in the &s;ame &s;tate as that of Hinkley la&s;t mentioned, I &s;hall refer to that account, and only &s;ay, we advi&s;ed it &s;hould be joined to the monthly-meeting of Ca&s;tle-Dunington, except a &s;mall branch thereof, which lay contiguous to Leice&s;ter. The 27th we vi&s;ited Oakham monthly-meeting, where much &s;lackne&s;s and indif|ference appeared, too many of the active members being at ea&s;e in a profe&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t wrong things prevailed, and death in&s;tead of life, over&s;hadowed their meetings. The Lord engaged us in a deep and fervent la|bour, to &s;tir them up, that they might ari&s;e and &s;hake them&s;elves from the du&s;t and clogging things of the earth, to receive
<PB N="342" REF="016793_0347_0F9E6ABEEA295D90">
the eye-&s;alve of God's kingdom, whereby they might come to &s;ee their own &s;tate as individual members, and al&s;o the general &s;tate of the church. Oh, how a&s;hamed would &s;ome then be, of their poverty and nakedne&s;s! We found a few among&s;t them in a humble, teachable frame of mind, with whom we had good &s;atisfaction, hope|ing this opportunity might tend to their help and improvement in the be&s;t things. The 28th we vi&s;ited Leice&s;ter monthly-meeting, in which we found &s;ome hone&s;t labourers for Sion's pro&s;perity, and truth opened our way, as at other places, to look carefully into the &s;tate of things, and to apply &s;uitable coun&s;el and advice, as the &s;ame immediately opened, for the re&s;toring good order and whole&s;ome di&s;cipline, which appeared too much neglected; and I hope that opportunity was of good &s;ervice to that meeting.</P>
<P>On the 29th of the 7th month the quar|terly-meeting for the county was held at Leice&s;ter, before which, we laid in writing the &s;tate of their monthly-meetings, as the &s;ame appeared to us in our late vi&s;it, with &s;uch remarks thereon, as &s;eemed to us pro|per and nece&s;&s;ary; and were deeply con|cerned, to bring the weighty &s;en&s;e of their great declen&s;ion upon the &s;pirits of the active members, and the great nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;peedy exertion of their Chri&s;|tian endeavours for a regulation, le&s;t a ge|neral
<PB N="343" REF="016793_0348_0F9E6ABFB3DDB1D8">
de&s;olation &s;hould en&s;ue. But, alas! the &s;tupefaction was &s;o great in this as well as other places, that it was hard laborious work; yet not without hope of a revival, as &s;ome concerned members were, by the over&s;hadowing of divine power, made wil|ling to give up their names, to contribute their endeavours for carrying on the nece&s;|&s;ary work of reformation, &s;o happily begun in the yearly-meeting. Here ended our vi&s;it to monthly and quarterly-meetings for the pre&s;ent; and I have, with deep reve|rence, humbly to acknowledge, that a re|markable evidence of divine approbation attended us throughout; making us of one heart, by the bapti&s;m of his unerring &s;pirit, &s;o that &s;carcely a difference of &s;entiment from one another appeared during the whole journey. Another thing which appeared to me a token of divine favour attending, was the open reception we met with, notwith|&s;tanding the plainne&s;s u&s;ed by us, in very clo&s;e &s;earching inquiries and remarks upon many di&s;orders. I hope my u&s;ual freedom, in laying open the &s;tates of the monthly-meetings, will give no ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence to any who wi&s;h well to Sion, &s;ince no|thing is more likely to &s;trike the minds of &s;ucceeding generations with fear and care, than to have the lukewarmne&s;s and defec|tion of many&punc; who have been &s;o wonder|fully favoured, &s;et in a true light before them, together with &s;uch a remarkable ac|count

of the Lord's compa&s;&s;ion and con|de&s;cending kindne&s;s, in &s;eeking their re|&s;toration, and offering his mercy to heal all their back&s;lidings. How can any, without being &s;omewhat affected with fear, read the &s;orrowful degeneracy of &s;ome Chri&s;tian churches, even in the apo&s;tles days; like the fir&s;t-fruits in the go&s;pel vineyard; par|ticularly that of the &s;even churches in A&s;ia Minor, di&s;covered to the beloved John, in his &s;tate of bani&s;hment for the word of God and the te&s;timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and by him with great plainne&s;s committed to writing, as a call and warning from God to them, and to remain, for the &s;ame end, to all &s;ucceeding generations? I have no other end in what I have written concern|ing the &s;tate of our &s;ociety; for who&s;e help and pre&s;ervation I have been freely given up in body, &s;oul, and &s;pirit, as well as in what outward &s;ub&s;tance the Lord hath bounti|fully favoured me with, to contribute my &s;mall endeavours, that her light may go forth as brightne&s;s, and her &s;alvation as a lamp that burns.</P>
<P>A &s;ummary account of this vi&s;it and &s;er|vice was drawn up by us, and read in the yearly-meeting 1762, as was done the year before, when engaged in a &s;ervice of the like nature. A like vi&s;it was al&s;o per|formed by other friends, who had, &s;ince the yearly-meeting 1761, engaged therein in different parts, whereby it appeared, all
<PB N="345" REF="016793_0350_0F9E6AC12C07CA20">
the monthly and quarterly-meetings, in that part of Great-Britain properly called Eng|land, had then been vi&s;ited; which, as far as appeared, had been performed to general &s;atisfaction. The yearly-meeting then re|commended to the friends appointed in 1760, the care of extending the &s;ame brotherly a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the meetings of our friends in Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, as their way might open in go&s;pel freedom. Neither did the yearly-meeting omit &s;ending a warm, lively epi&s;tle to tho&s;e already vi&s;it|ed, to corroborate, revive, and &s;trengthen the great labour be&s;towed, that the &s;ame might be made effectual. I &s;hall now clo&s;e this narrative with ju&s;t adding, that I have found by &s;olid experience, that it was a ble&s;&s;ed work, and greatly ble&s;&s;ed in the carrying on. May it be &s;o in the fruits ari&s;ing therefrom, is the &s;incere de&s;ire of my &s;oul!</P>
<P>The 21&s;t of the 8th month, 1762, I &s;et out, in order to vi&s;it London and &s;ome other parts, and on fir&s;t-day the 22d, I went to Ratcliff meeting in the morning, where I had clo&s;e, thorough &s;ervice; truth and its te&s;timony having con&s;iderable dominion; it was an awakening time to carele&s;s profe&s;|&s;ors, and of refre&s;hing con&s;olation to Sion's travellers, of whom I believe there was a con&s;iderable number there; I had with &s;atisfaction to believe that meeting was on the improving hand. I went in the after|noon
<PB N="346" REF="016793_0351_0F9E6AC1E4951108">
to Hor&s;lydown; this was a time of deep travail and painful labour, as the life of religion &s;eemed to be greatly depre&s;&s;ed, by much indifference of mind in many, and the prevalence of fle&s;hly liberties in others; yet through infinite conde&s;cen&s;ion, at length the power and virtue of truth aro&s;e, where|by the te&s;timony thereof was exalted over wrong things. On the &s;econd-day follow|ing I attended the morning meeting, and went on fourth-day to their monthly-meet|ing at the Peel, in which, through the ex|tending of heavenly good, I had open, edifying &s;ervice; friends being favoured with a degree of that holy leaven, which, as it is abode in, pre&s;erves the &s;everal mem|bers of one heart and one mind. Oh, then the work goes &s;weetly on, the body edifying it&s;elf in love, as well as with one voice giving forth &s;ound judgment again&s;t wrong things! On fir&s;t-day, the 29th, I went in the morning to We&s;tmin&s;ter, which was a very open good meeting, the te&s;ti|mony of truth went forth freely and largely, wi&s;dom being given to divide the word aright, &s;o that the di&s;obedient were warned, and the mourners in Sion com|forted. I went in the afternoon to the Peel meeting, which was large and very la|borious, in a &s;uffering &s;ilence throughout; which, in &s;ympathy with the depre&s;&s;ed &s;eed of God's kingdom, and for an example to the profe&s;&s;ors thereof, appeared to be my
<PB N="347" REF="016793_0352_0F9E6AC2F66C7EC0">
proper bu&s;ine&s;s at that time. I attended the morning meeting on &s;econd-day, and went on 3d day to Plai&s;tow week-day meet|ing, in which I had &s;ome clo&s;e &s;ervice; but things, as to the life of religion, ap|peared to me low there, where the profe&s;|&s;ors of truth neglect a con&s;tant labour for daily bread. I &s;pent that afternoon and the next day, chiefly on a vi&s;it to our wor|thy friend John Hayward, who appeared green in old age. On fifth-day, the 2d of the 9th month, I went to Tottenham; there being two con&s;iderable friends &s;chools, one for boys, and the other for girls. By the free opening of the living fountain, it was a very precious, comfortable meeting, doctrine and coun&s;el being plentifully hand|ed forth, &s;uitably adapted to the childrens weak capacities, as well as to tho&s;e of riper age: through the divine ble&s;&s;ing, it was a time of high favour and humble refre&s;h|ment to the upright in heart. That after|noon I had a very comfortable reviving time with our friend Jo&s;iah For&s;ter and family, he being in a very poor &s;tate of health, in appearance not likely to conti|nue long in this world; he, with much tenderne&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfaction in that opportunity. On &s;ixth-day, the 3d, I went <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Gracechurch-Street meeting, which was low and laborious; it appeared my proper bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;it in &s;ilence. On fir&s;t-day, the 5th&punc; I went to Gracechurch-Street
<PB N="348" REF="016793_0353_0F9E6AC3C95A8BE8">
in the morning, where the meeting was ex|ceeding large, and for a time, very trying and painful; yet in the latter part, it plea&s;ed the Lord to ari&s;e, and his enemies were &s;cattered; then was truth exalted, and its te&s;timony went forth freely, having great dominion. In the afternoon, I went to the Peel meeting, where I had large, open &s;er|vice, and truth was over all; it being a time of much comfort and relief to the &s;incere-hearted. Next day I was at the monthly morning-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, &s;o called becau&s;e the members more gene|rally attend, e&s;pecially the women. It was a ble&s;&s;ed time, wherein I had open good &s;ervice, &s;hewing the great difference be|tween the mini&s;ters of the letter and tho&s;e of the &s;pirit: that the letter without the &s;pirit, though of the holy &s;cripture it&s;elf, kills that which is begotten of God in the hearts of people; but that it is the holy power, efficacy, and demon&s;tration of the eternal &s;pirit, that renders the holy &s;crip|ture, outward mini&s;try, and all other means ordained of God, for the comfort, help, and pre&s;ervation of his people, effectual. I had to ob&s;erve, that the mini&s;ters of the letter were mo&s;t of all concerned for the external appearance of their mini&s;try, viz. that the words and doctrine may be curiou&s;ly adapted, not to di&s;gu&s;t, but rather to plea&s;e tho&s;e who have itching ears; on the con|trary, the mini&s;ters of the &s;pirit are lea&s;t
<PB N="349" REF="016793_0354_0F9E6AC47ACBBA30">
of all concerned about the outward appear|ance of their mini&s;try; having no doubt, if they are careful in the &s;pring, ground, and moving cau&s;e, which they know &s;hould be the con&s;training power of the holy &s;pirit, that will al&s;o be agreeable thereunto; &s;eeing that power is able to render the mo&s;t low and &s;imple expre&s;&s;ion, in man's account, exceedingly efficacious. On third-day, the 7th, I &s;et out, accompanied by &s;everal friends, in order to have a meeting that afternoon at Charleywood; it was a time of awakening labour, not ea&s;ily I hope to be forgot. On fourth-day, the 8th, I had a precious, open, &s;erviceable meeting, at Jordan's in the morning; it was a time of general awakening, at lea&s;t to a pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e of duty: that afternoon I had a painful laborious meeting at Uxbridge, and what made it more afflicting, was, that the go&s;|pel endeavours u&s;ed for the help and reco|very of lukewarm profe&s;&s;ors, &s;eemed to take very little effect upon their minds. On fourth-day, the 8th, I went to Staines meeting, which, in the fore-part, was a time of very heavy, painful, &s;ilent labour; in which, as at many other times on the like occa&s;ion, I fully expected the cloud and di&s;tre&s;s would remain, till we &s;eparated one from another; yet near the conclu&s;ion, through infinite conde&s;cen&s;ion, truth aro&s;e and obtained a complete victory over wrong things; their &s;tates being &s;poken to with
<PB N="350" REF="016793_0355_0F9E6AC9D76B0E60">
great plainne&s;s; but, alas! things, as to the life of religion, &s;eemed but low among&s;t mo&s;t of all ranks there. I went next day to a meeting at Godalmin, which proved a time of much favour, in the &s;weet and precious enjoyment of the con&s;olating &s;treams of that river, which maketh glad the whole city of God; in the ble&s;&s;ed efficacy whereof, the doctrines of truth were largely opened, &s;etting forth the na|ture of faith, hope, and charity; but the greate&s;t of all is charity, as faith will be &s;wallowed up in open vi&s;ion, and hope in the full enjoyment; but charity never fails nor changes its nature, being the &s;ame in time and in eternity. On fir&s;t-day, the 12th, I was at Alton meet|ing, in Hamp&s;hire, where we had a very large and precious baptizing meeting; in the morning, the te&s;timony of truth had great dominion, and the living members were &s;weetly comforted together. The af|ternoon meeting there was very heavy and laborious, and held in &s;ilence. I had a very open &s;atisfactory meeting at E&s;her, on third-day the 14th, and another at Wand&s;worth the next day; after which I went to Lon|don, and the next day, being the 16th of the 9th month, I returned home, finding my dear wife and family well: having, through infinite kindne&s;s, been much fa|voured in my &s;ervice this &s;mall journey, and found more openne&s;s in the city of London than heretofore. It was with great
<PB N="351" REF="016793_0356_0F9E6ACA2669C938">
comfort I had to &s;ee a growing hidden rem|nant in that city, who will be exalted in I&s;rael in the Lord's time; who hath, and will yet open a way more and more, for his pained travelling children to exalt his name and truth, by removing the &s;tumbling blocks and other impediments which yet remain in their way, and hinders them in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from taking the rule and go|vernment, which is their due and right in the kingdom of Chri&s;t; and u&s;urpers &s;hall &s;ee, none can &s;it with Chri&s;t upon thrones, but tho&s;e who faithfully follow him in the re|generation, agreeable to his gracious pro|mi&s;e, viz.

<P>To this period of time, being now in the fiftieth year of my age, I have continued an account of divers occurrences of my life, labours, and experience; with &s;undry ob|&s;ervations on the &s;tate of the Chri&s;tian &s;o|ciety of which I am a member; and though done in a way of plain dealing, yet in truth and &s;incerity, as my mind hath been im|mediately led and opened thereunto. Let none therefore take any undue advantages thereby to reproach the &s;ame: no &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians, that I have ever had any know|ledge of, hath any advantage of this peo|ple, either in principle or practice.

<P>From the year 1762, to the 7th month 1765, I have pre&s;erved no particular me|morandum of my travels and &s;ervice that I can at pre&s;ent find, and although I tra|velled no con&s;iderable journies, yet, as I always thought it my incumbent duty, from my fir&s;t acquaintance with God's everla&s;t|ing truth, I diligently attended meetings when at home and well, both fir&s;t and week days, al&s;o the quarterly and yearly-meet|ings, as they fell in cour&s;e; as well as &s;ome adjacent quarterly and other meetings. In the year 1764, I attended the yearly-meet|ings of Colche&s;ter, Woodbridge, and Nor|wich, to good &s;atisfaction and comfort, being favoured with free open &s;ervice there|in, especially the two la&s;t. In the &s;ame year, having an inclination to vi&s;it London and &s;ome parts adjacent, as my way might open; and likewi&s;e having a manu&s;cript by me, which I had written about two years be|fore, intitled, <HI>Some Brief Remarks upon &s;un|dry important Subjects, &amp;c.</HI> divers friends who&s;e judgment I valued, having peru&s;ed

it, expre&s;&s;ed their unity therewith, gene|rally apprehending there might be a &s;er|vice in making the &s;ame publick; being thus encouraged, I laid it before the &s;econd-day morning meeting of London, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es; I attended the revi&s;ing of it for the mo&s;t part: friends agreed it &s;hould be printed, which was accordingly done. It was afterwards reprinted here, in Ireland, and in America.</P>
<P>Having had a view, for &s;everal years, of vi&s;iting friends in the American Colonies, as I waited with earne&s;t de&s;ires to be rightly directed in &s;o &s;olemn and weighty an under|taking, both as to the thing it&s;elf and the proper time to enter thereupon, I was fa|voured with clear and full &s;atisfaction, in both re&s;pects; and had &s;een, for a con&s;ider|able time, that I &s;hould embark for that &s;ervice &s;oon after our yearly-meeting 1765: this I e&s;teemed a particular favour, as I had thereby the better opportunity to order my outward affairs timely, &s;o as I might, with more freedom and ea&s;e, leave them &s;o long a time; yet, except to my wife and two or three friends, who were enjoined &s;e|cre&s;y, I kept all to my&s;elf, till about the time it became nece&s;&s;ary to lay my concern before the monthly-meeting of which I was a member: which I did, and readily obtained their concurrence, and a certificate very fully expre&s;&s;ive of their unity; which certificate I carried to our quarterly-meet|ing,
<PB N="354" REF="016793_0359_0F9E6ACC61B4A980">
laying the &s;ame, with my &s;aid con|cern, before that meeting; I al&s;o obtained their ready concurrence, &s;ignified by an in|dor&s;ement on the monthly-meeting certifi|cate; which certificate and indor&s;ement, together with my concern, I laid before the yearly-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders in London, and after a time of weighty con|&s;ideration, friends drew up and &s;igned a cer|tificate of their full unity with me, and my intended undertaking. The ready and una|nimous concurrence of my much e&s;teemed friends, was a great &s;trength and comfort to me in my entering upon and throughout this &s;olemn engagement. I was very &s;en|&s;ible it was of &s;uch a nature, that the whole body of friends were deeply intere&s;ted in the right and proper performance thereof; and therefore found my mind much re&s;igned to the divine will, and to the determina|tion of his people. I returned home from the yearly-meeting, to complete the &s;et|tlement of my outward affairs, having part|ly concluded, with divine permi&s;&s;ion, to embark in a &s;hip likely to &s;ail in two or three weeks. I went to our quarterly and yearly-meeting at Colche&s;ter: where, being taken very ill of a fever, I returned home with my wife in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, being unable to ride on hor&s;e-back. I was confined to my chamber about ten days; this put an intire &s;top to all preparations for my intend|ed voyage; which, on account of my illne&s;s,
<PB N="355" REF="016793_0360_0F9E6ACD6796CFB8">
I had wholly given over the expectation of, as to the before-mentioned &s;hip; but when I recovered, &s;o as to be able to move a little about, my mind did not &s;eem ea&s;y to let that &s;hip go away without me. I there|upon wrote to the merchants or owners, who I knew were de&s;irous I &s;hould go in her, to know what time they could allow me to get ready; their an&s;wer was, about ten days: the time was &s;hort, and I was very weak in body, and had &s;ome affairs of con&s;equence to &s;ettle which would take &s;ome time; however, the will being good, I &s;et about them in earne&s;t, and beyond expectation &s;ucceeded therein, recovered &s;trength apace, and got through my affairs in time to &s;atisfaction. I could not help looking upon this a providential &s;ucce&s;s, as it was far beyond human probability: the Lord, in his dealing with us his poor dependant creatures, &s;ometimes brings us very low, baffling all our &s;kill and contri|vance, that he may clearly &s;hew us, that our &s;ucce&s;s in &s;piritual things, and even in temporals al&s;o, is by his providence.</P>
<P>On the 9th day of the 7th month, 1765, I took leave of my dear wife and family, and accompanied by &s;everal friends, went to meet the &s;hip at Grave&s;end, where we were met by about fifteen or &s;ixteen friends from Lon|don; we dined together, and lodged there that night. Next day, being the 10th of the 7th month, I took leave of friends in

much tender affection, and went on board the Carolina, James Friend ma&s;ter, bound for Philadelphia. We got under &s;ail about eleven o'clock, but it was near a week be|fore we took our departure from the Land's-End of England. We had, for a few days, a pretty fair wind, and a good &s;et-of from the land; yet on our pa&s;&s;age we had a great deal of contrary winds, and often a head &s;ea. About the 9th and 10th of the 8th month, and for &s;ome time before, things had but a very di&s;couraging a&s;pect, having got but a little on our way for about twenty days; mo&s;t of the company &s;eemed to be affected with &s;adne&s;s on that account: at the &s;ame time I had a &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion of mind, that the wind would turn in our fa|vour before night, and had almo&s;t an in|clination to have told them &s;o, in order to cheer their &s;pirits, but was fearful of pre|&s;uming too much upon the certainty of what had pre&s;ented to my view, le&s;t I &s;hould prove a fal&s;e prophet, and thereby bring di&s;honour to the good cau&s;e; how|ever, it proved true, and held favourable to us a con&s;iderable time, &s;o that we &s;ailed next day &s;even or eight miles an hour the right way. The 21&s;t of the 8th month we found our&s;elves upon one of the banks of Newfoundland, having about twenty-eight fathom water. It was &s;ome &s;ati&s;|faction to find our&s;elves &s;o far on our way; I was favoured with very good health, and a
<PB N="357" REF="016793_0362_0F9E6AD2AA5A58A0">
good appetite all the time, and, through di|vine favour, generally with a quiet re&s;igned mind, having full &s;atisfaction that I was in my place. The captain was very &s;teady, and well qualified for his &s;tation, and very kind to me; the pa&s;&s;engers al&s;o were gene|rally civil in their behaviour, though they often burdened and wearied my &s;pirit with their trifling, vain, empty di&s;cour&s;es, in which I could not join, but was rather a reprover and a weight again&s;t them, which I am per&s;uaded they frequently felt, and I am &s;en&s;ible I was a con&s;iderable awe upon them; yet I thought it was prudent, as we were confined in one another's company, to uphold a family re&s;pect. I often reproved their vanity and corrupt conver&s;ation, and was enabled, in a good degree, to bring judgment over them, &s;o that &s;ome would own I was right. Alas, I had &s;orrowfully to ob&s;erve, by their manner of conver&s;ation, how empty, vain, trifling, and even cor|rupt, the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e e&s;teemed the genteel and polite part of mankind, in our day, is become; little or nothing to be found therein, that conveys &s;olid, profita|ble in&s;truction, either in things relating to this life or the next, but in general it tends to deprave and corrupt: yet many thus void of &s;elf-denial and government of their tongues, pretend, with great a&s;&s;urance, to lay undeniable claim to the holy and undefiled religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; &s;urely, they do
<PB N="358" REF="016793_0363_0F9E6AD324ED81A8">
not give them&s;elves any time to think &s;eri|ou&s;ly about the nature of that religion, and mu&s;t conclude, the name and profe&s;&s;ion without the &s;pirit and life, is all they are to look for, except adhering to a few ex|terior ob&s;ervations: &s;uch gro&s;s darkne&s;s and &s;tupefaction is much to be lamented, but very hard to be helped when they are &s;o ignorant of their own &s;tates.</P>
<P>It was the 10th of the 9th month, early in the morning, that we fir&s;t &s;aw land, which proved to be Cape Henlopen; about &s;ix o'clock we got a pilot on board, who was a native Indian; about nine we entered the Capes of the Delaware, with the tide beginning to make in our favour; about eleven our &s;hip &s;truck the ground three times, but &s;oon got off. We had fine wind and weather, which made it exceeding plea|&s;ant &s;ailing up the bay and river; we got up with that tide, within about &s;ix leagues of the city. Next day, about eleven o'clock, we came to an anchor before the city of Philadelphia. I &s;oon landed and went directly to my old quarters, being very kindly received as formerly, by my much e&s;teemed friends I&s;aac and Sarah Zane. I was about nine weeks on board the &s;hip in all, and about eight from land to land. I attended their week-day meeting on fifth-day, and had &s;ome good open &s;ervice there|in. I went on fir&s;t-day to the great meet|ing, where perhaps was pre&s;ent, near, if

not quite, 1500 friends, or tho&s;e under our profe&s;&s;ion; my bu&s;ine&s;s among them at that time &s;eemed to be to &s;et them an example of &s;ilence. I had, with &s;ecret lamentation, to view their remarkable declen&s;ion from a true &s;piritual exerci&s;e, which appeared to me but too general, looking for words to feed upon; I found that craving was to be di&s;appointed and fami&s;hed, and therefore was often &s;hut up from public &s;ervice a|mong&s;t them, e&s;pecially at the great hou&s;e, though I had &s;ome very clear, open, power|ful times, in the ble&s;&s;ed light and life of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, there al&s;o. On &s;ixth-day, the 20th of the 9th month, I cro&s;&s;ed the river Delaware, and went to Haddon|field quarterly-meeting, which was very large, and I was largely opened to declare the truth among&s;t them with good authority. I returned next day to the city, and attended the yearly-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders; things &s;eemed but low: this yearly-meet|ing, which was very large, concluded on &s;ixth-day. It was in a good degree favour|ed with divine wi&s;dom and &s;trength, where|in friends were enabled to con&s;ider and con|clude &s;ome weighty affairs with unanimity and brotherly love. The Lord was graci|ou&s;ly with me, affording wi&s;dom and &s;trength to be &s;erviceable at this meeting, both in mini&s;try and di&s;cipline, wherein I had &s;weet peace and comfort. I went the fir&s;t-day following to Springfield-meeting,
<PB N="360" REF="016793_0365_0F9E6AD4A91AF6E8">
in Che&s;ter county, where I had very open weighty &s;ervice, and the ble&s;&s;ed truth pre|vailed. In the evening I had a comfortable meeting with a &s;ick friend at Derby, who &s;oon after departed this life. I then re|turned to Philadelphia, and attended both their week-day meetings, which were pain|fully laborious in a &s;ilent travail. On &s;ixth-day went to their monthly-meeting, and was livingly opened therein, to &s;hew the rea&s;on why the church of Chri&s;t is com|pared to a human body, con&s;i&s;ting of many and various members; I had good &s;ervice al&s;o in the meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s. Their num|ber is very large, but many appeared to me weak and un&s;kilful as to the proper qua|lifications of active members in the church, &s;ome of them did not appear to be re|deemed from fear, favour, and affection in judgment. I had great comfort in the la|bour of this day. On third-day, the 1&s;t of the 10th month, I had a very large meet|ing at Haddonfield, in We&s;t-Jer&s;ey; the word was given with clearne&s;s and go&s;pel authority, and I had to &s;hew the power and efficacy of true faith, and the weakne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency of an hi&s;torical or implicit faith: it was a good time, and the glori|ous truth was exalted. I then went to Che&s;ter; the meeting was very large, and I had clo&s;e, thorough &s;ervice therein, on the &s;ubject of &s;elf-denial and taking up the daily cro&s;s. On fifth-day, had a very large
<PB N="361" REF="016793_0366_0F9E6AD565DA4308">
meeting at Eve&s;ham, and had therein weighty &s;ervice, on the nature of that new-birth, without which no man can &s;ee the kingdom of God; mo&s;t of the auditory &s;eemed much &s;trangers thereto, which made the labour heavier, yet wi&s;dom was mer|cifully given to divide the word to this numerous a&s;&s;embly, about the &s;pace of two hours. Next day I had a very thronged meeting at Mount-Holly, in New-Jer&s;ey; my labour in the mini&s;try was very clo&s;e and &s;earching, to good &s;atisfaction. On fir&s;t-day, the 6th of the 10th month, was at Burlington meeting, and had an open time; al&s;o at their monthly-meeting on the &s;econd-day following, which was very large; I was livingly opened upon the&s;e words,
<Q>Pray without cea&s;ing, and in every thing give thanks;</Q>
al&s;o &s;hewing, that the power of the word of life ought to be the &s;pring of action in the church of Chri&s;t. On third-day, accompanied by divers friends, I cro&s;&s;ed the river Delaware, and had a meeting at Bri&s;tol, in Penn&s;ylvania; it was a &s;mall poor meeting, I laboured according to ability received, to &s;tir up the members to a more lively concern, but things ap|peared very low. On fourth-day I had a large meeting at the Falls; it was very la|borious, under a &s;en&s;e of a dry, lifele&s;s &s;tate in too many, and the incon&s;i&s;tent con|duct of others; e&s;pecially in that of exce&s;|&s;ive drinking, which I felt to cau&s;e a very
<PB N="362" REF="016793_0367_0F9E6AD63191F4E8">
ill &s;avour: I was informed after, it had great|ly prevailed upon many in that meeting, and that divers of them who were there that day, had been di&s;owned on that ac|count. Next day I had a large meeting at Wright's-town; I was opened therein, to &s;hew the &s;imilarity between the travels of the &s;oul towards &s;piritual Canaan, and tho&s;e of the I&s;raelites towards the outward Canaan. It was a clo&s;e awakening time to dry, formal profe&s;&s;ors. On &s;ixth-day, I had an exceeding large meeting at Buck|ingham; to this great gathering the ever|la&s;ting go&s;pel was powerfully preached, and the end and de&s;ign of true mini&s;try &s;et forth; this was a ble&s;&s;ed time of divine re|fre&s;hment, to the rejoicing of many hearts, and rou&s;ing, I hope, of the lukewarm, in a good degree. After this meeting, I felt it in my mind to &s;peak to Thomas Ro&s;s, a friend in the mini&s;try of that county, to bear me company to the &s;outhern provinces, which he, after due con&s;ideration and ob|taining his friends concurrence and certifi|cate, complied with; and not only that journey, but al&s;o to New-England, &amp;c. &s;o that I was favoured with the agreeable company of this valuable friend, through mo&s;t of my American travels, which was to my great comfort. On fir&s;t-day, the 13th of the 10th month, I was at North-Wales meeting, which was very large, and was favoured with a thorough open time,
<PB N="363" REF="016793_0368_0F9E6AD707D8E558">
to the tendering of many hearts. The day following had a large meeting at Plymouth; I was opened upon that pa&s;&s;age,
<Q>Believe not every &s;pirit,</Q>
&amp;c. had clo&s;e work with li|bertines, &s;uch as are commonly called free-thinkers, and was carried over them: truth and its te&s;timony was greatly exalted and triumphed over that &s;pirit, and other wrong things. On third-day, had a large meet|ing at Hor&s;ham, and was powerfully open|ed on the words of the prophet Joel, viz.
<Q>I will pour out my &s;pirit upon all fle&s;h,</Q>
&amp;c. with &s;ome clo&s;e remarks to tho&s;e who re&s;t &s;atisfied with a mere profe&s;|&s;ion. After meeting, came a &s;eventh-day Bapti&s;t to the friend's hou&s;e where I was; and if I had &s;uffered it, would have led me out into a wide field of argument, for which I had neither time nor inclination; he ad|vanced &s;everal points, but I kept him &s;o clo&s;e to &s;ome of them that he was &s;oon foiled, he found my method of arguing &s;o different from his; he being for a multitude of words and a great deal of ramble, and I was for but a few words clo&s;e to the point, backed with clear &s;cripture proof, &s;o we had quickly done; he &s;eemed willing to drop it, and &s;o was I, for &s;uch are &s;o full of notion and &s;o fixed therein, that the cleare&s;t rea&s;oning &s;eems thrown away upon them. On fourth-day had a very large meeting at Abington, the place which I belonged to in my youthful days, and where
<PB N="364" REF="016793_0369_0F9E6AD7A04B6908">
I was fir&s;t, through infinite mercy, brought to the knowledge of the ever-ble&s;&s;ed truth; and where my mouth was fir&s;t opened above thirty years before, in a public te&s;timony. A dark cloud &s;eemed painfully over the meeting in the fore part, yet at length truth prevailed, and utterance was largely given to declare the doctrine thereof, &s;hewing that the children of I&s;rael feared the Lord all the days of Jo&s;hua, and of the elders that out-lived him. It was a very awakening time, and many appeared to be pretty much affected. Next day I had a &s;mall meeting at Frankfort, things appeared very low and dark for a time, yet at length, wi&s;dom and utterance were given upon the&s;e words,
<Q>Man being in honour, and abiding not therein, is like the bea&s;t that peri&s;heth.</Q>
There &s;eemed a want of a living concern in the general. Next day had a large meet|ing at German-town, this was a dark pain|ful time in the fore part; truth mea&s;urably aro&s;e, and the word was given, viz.
<Q>Let God ari&s;e, that his enemies may be &s;cattered.</Q>
Went after meeting to Phi|ladelphia, and on 1&s;t day, the 20th of the 10th month, over Schuylkill, to Merion meeting; things appeared exceeding low, as to the life of religion; I was concerned to call them to work while it is day, and it was a clo&s;e &s;earching time. On &s;econd-day I went to the burial of a valuable friend at Derby, the &s;ame with whom I had a meet|ing
<PB N="365" REF="016793_0370_0F9E6ADA82B36800">
before-mentioned; the meeting was very large, and there was great openne&s;s to declare the truth with clearne&s;s and divine authority, even to the confounding liber|tines and gain&s;ayers, of whom I fear there is a con&s;iderable number in that place: this &s;eemed to me the mo&s;t favoured time I had had &s;ince I landed, and being al&s;o at the meeting I formerly belonged to for many years, it was a precious renewal of that &s;weet unity &s;ome of us had enjoyed toge|ther many times formerly in that place. Next day I went to Philadelphia; and the fir&s;t-day following to Newtown meeting, in Che&s;ter county, where I had very &s;earch|ing laborious &s;ervice; things appeared to me mournfully low, as to the life of reli|gion, many being at ea&s;e in a profe&s;&s;ion thereof. I went next day to the month|ly-meeting at Providence, and had &s;ome good edifying &s;ervice to the poor in &s;pirit; things appeared very low and heavy in the meeting for bu&s;ine&s;s. On third-day I had a large meeting at Radnor, and laboured to convince them that there is &s;omething in religion be&s;ides the form and outward pro|fe&s;&s;ion, but few &s;eemed to me alive there|in. On fourth-day went to Haverford meeting; I was opened upon the words of the apo&s;tle, viz.
<Q>Great is the my&s;tery of godline&s;s; God manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h.</Q>
It was a good time, though the profe&s;&s;ors are but few, and in a poor weak &s;tate. I
<PB N="366" REF="016793_0371_0F9E6ADB9932BAB8">
went on fifth-day to the monthly-meeting at Derby, the life of religion &s;eemed very much depre&s;&s;ed; I was &s;ilent as to mini&s;try, but had &s;ome &s;ervice in the meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s, and returned to the city that night. I had been indi&s;po&s;ed &s;ome days pa&s;t, and in much pain with a kind of flux; took &s;ome medicine on &s;ixth-day, and was &s;oon better. Next day I went to their quarterly-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, where I was living|ly opened on that pa&s;&s;age,
<Q>Him that over|cometh, I will make a pillar in the hou&s;e of my God,</Q>
&amp;c. Shewing, that the bea&s;t and the fal&s;e prophet mu&s;t be over|come, before we can &s;tand with &s;afety and approbation in the great work of the mi|ni&s;try. This quarterly-meeting ended on third-day, at the &s;everal &s;ittings of which I had good open &s;ervice, particularly at the Bank meeting on fir&s;t-day afternoon, &s;hewing that tho&s;e who are more willing to receive than to make &s;uitable returns, are neither &s;o hone&s;t nor grateful as they ought to be; and on third-day, at the great hou&s;e, being the youths meeting, which was very large, concerning the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t and fire; there was great flowing of love and enlargement of heart to the young people that way. On fourth-day I was at a meeting appointed for the poor negroes, and had open good &s;ervice among&s;t them, in the free flowing of univer&s;al love, wherein
<PB N="367" REF="016793_0372_0F9E6ADC2787B870">
I was enabled to open unto them the way of life and &s;alvation; divers of them ap|peared to be affected and tendered; it was a comfortable time. On fifth-day I was at a marriage in the city, and largely opened upon the&s;e words, viz.
<Q>The ble&s;&s;ing of God maketh truly rich,</Q>
&amp;c. Shewing, there is no real happine&s;s in any &s;tation of life without it. It was a good time, for truth prevailed.</P>
<P>I &s;et out on &s;ixth-day, the 8th of the 10th month, on my intended journey to|wards Maryland, Virginia, and Carolina; and went that night to my brother-in-law, Micajah Speakman's, at Concord. Next day began their quarterly-meeting: through divine favour, I had thorough &s;ervice at the three meetings held there: on &s;eventh-day, at the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, I was livingly opened upon the&s;e words of Chri&s;t,
<Q>The di&s;ciple is not above his ma&s;ter, nor the &s;ervant above his Lord;</Q>
al&s;o, concerning what was declared of Chri&s;t,
<Q>That in his humiliation, his judg|ment was taken away,</Q>
&amp;c<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts viii. 33.</NOTE>. That it is not to be wondered at, if our judgment in the truth is taken away at times, that we may &s;ee who is the giver of it; it was an effectual reaching time. On fir&s;t-day I was mournfully affected with a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;en&s;e of the apo&s;tacy of many in that meet|ing,
<PB N="368" REF="016793_0373_0F9E6ADCE1990360">
from the life and power of religion; I had a very clo&s;e awakening time, and truth mercifully prevailed. On &s;econd-day I was largely opened with good authority, on the&s;e and other words,
<Q>He that cometh after me, mu&s;t fir&s;t deny him&s;elf,</Q>
&amp;c. Great weakne&s;s and want of living concern was felt in that exceeding large meeting, and too much leaning to their own under|&s;tanding, yet a faithful remnant is pre|&s;erved; I was favoured to be &s;erviceable in the meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s. I took Birming|ham and Kennet meetings, in my way to the quarterly-meeting at London-Grove; the&s;e were very large, and I had deep &s;earch|ing &s;ervice at them; but, alas! the life and power of religion is mournfully departed from by great numbers in that highly fa|voured land. On &s;eventh-day, the 16th of the 11th month, I went to the quarter|ly-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders at Lon|don-Grove; it was a very painful di&s;tre&s;&s;ing time; great barrenne&s;s and carnality appear|ed to have prevailed in too many in tho&s;e &s;tations, which was cau&s;e of &s;ore lamenta|tion: my public &s;ervice among&s;t them was in much clo&s;e plain-dealing, &s;hewing,
<Q>that to be carnally-minded is death; and that the natural man under&s;tandeth not the things of the &s;pirit of God.</Q>
Here my intended companion, Thomas Ro&s;s, met me. On fir&s;t-day the meeting was very large; I had a clo&s;e &s;earching time, parti|cularly
<PB N="369" REF="016793_0374_0F9E6ADDD71DF030">
to &s;ome who &s;tood in the foremo&s;t rank; my &s;pirit was much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in viewing the great de&s;olation made by the prevalence of many evils. On &s;econd-day I had large thorough &s;ervice to the various &s;tates of the members, and al&s;o in the meet|ing of bu&s;ine&s;s, which appeared to be well conducted; &s;ome &s;kilful members being principally engaged therein. On third-day the meeting was very large, and through divine favour, I was rai&s;ed in much &s;trength and clearne&s;s to divide the word among&s;t them; &s;hewing,
<Q>That the children of I&s;rael feared the Lord all the days of Jo&s;hua, and of the elders that out-lived Jo&s;hua, who had &s;een the wonders of the Lord.</Q>
I was opened largely upon the degeneracy of our &s;ociety, and with great weight and dread, I had to &s;ignify, that the judgments of the Lord would be poured out upon them, and that what they had yet &s;een, was but like the beginning of &s;orrows, that the &s;troke would fall upon their idols, their worldly enjoyments. It came before me many times, that the fruits of the earth would be &s;mitten, whereby there would be a &s;ore famine in the land, and that judg|ments, much heavier than they had yet known, would fall upon them; it &s;eemed to me various ways, of which the &s;word would be one. It was an exceeding awful deep-&s;earching time as ever I knew; I hope not ea&s;ily to be forgotten. Next day I went
<PB N="370" REF="016793_0375_0F9E6ADECBDE0660">
to Sad&s;bury monthly-meeting, where I had &s;atisfactory &s;ervice, both in the mini&s;try and di&s;cipline. On &s;ixth-day we had a meeting at Lanca&s;ter; divers not under our name came to it; my concern therein was to en|deavour to open to the under&s;tanding of the people, what true religion is: we had a pretty &s;atisfactory meeting at I&s;aac White|lock's in the evening. On &s;eventh-day, we cro&s;&s;ed Su&s;quehanna, at Wright's-Ferry, and next day went to Newbury meet|ing; &s;econd-day to Warrington; third-day to Huntington; fourth-day to Monallen; at all which places, I had clo&s;e thorough &s;ervice; found things, as to the life of religion, very low among&s;t friends; yet a remnant was pre&s;erved &s;en&s;ible from whence good comes. We went from thence into Maryland, and had &s;mall meetings at Pipe-Creek, and Bu&s;h-Creek; friends were few in number, and &s;eemed low in religious expe|rience. From thence, fording over the great river Patowmack, we entered the province of Virginia, and on third-day, the 3d of the 12th month, we had a very large meeting at Fair-fax: truth opened doctrine and coun&s;el largely, &s;hewing, that two things are e&s;&s;en|tial to the very being of a true Chri&s;tian, viz. The &s;aving experimental knowledge of God, and the knowledge of our&s;elves; the la&s;t being the natural con&s;equence of the fir&s;t: it was a highly favoured time, and the living were &s;weetly comforted. Next day
<PB N="371" REF="016793_0376_0F9E6ADF4E858398">
I had a large meeting at Goo&s;e-Creek; it was an exceeding dark afflicting time: my mind was deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of a corrupt, bla&s;ting mini&s;try being among&s;t them; and the people having itching ears, loved to have it &s;o; this was &s;o &s;trong upon my mind, that I feared for &s;ome time I &s;hould have been under a nece&s;&s;ity of declaring it publicly in the meeting; I was an intire &s;tranger, and did not know by any out|ward information, that they had any who appeared in public. After meeting, I took &s;ome of the elderly friends a&s;ide, and told them how it had been with me, as above, for I was &s;ilent the whole meeting; I was informed afterwards, that there was a for|ward unruly man, who had given &s;en&s;ible friends much trouble in &s;everal places, and had been much laboured with by way of ad|vice, to refrain from his public appearance; that he had for &s;ome time &s;ettled within the compa&s;s of that remote meeting, and was encouraged by many of the members, to the great unea&s;ine&s;s of &s;ome others. That afternoon I put what was upon my mind in relation thereto, with a few remarks thereon, in writing, and &s;ent it to &s;ome friends of that meeting, but never heard what effect it had. In our way to Opeckan, we had a &s;mall meeting at a place called the Gap, where go&s;pel doctrine, &s;hewing the way and means of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, was freely and largely preached. On fir&s;t-day,
<PB N="372" REF="016793_0377_0F9E6AE382FBA048">
the 8th of the 12th month, we went to Hopewell meeting; it was an exceeding dark, afflicting time; great in&s;en&s;ibility and lukewarmne&s;s appeared in almo&s;t a general way; I was led in as clo&s;e, plain-dealing, and &s;earching a manner, as ever I remem|ber. The third-day following we had a large meeting at Crooked-Run, both friends and many others attended. My mind was exceedingly low the morning of that day, be|ing lately &s;et out on a great journey, and my hor&s;e was fallen very lame, and it &s;eemed un|likely that I could be &s;upplied with a &s;uitable one in tho&s;e back parts: what to do I could not tell; the more I thought about my di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed condition, the more I &s;unk and was perplexed. In this di&s;con&s;olate &s;tate, I went to the meeting: to &s;ee &s;uch a number of other &s;ocieties, and &s;ome of them of high rank by their appearance, &s;till added to my di&s;tre&s;s in this weak &s;tate, greatly fearing the ble&s;&s;ed truth &s;hould be di&s;honoured through me; yet as I endeavoured to look &s;ingly to the Lord, he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to be a pre&s;ent help in the needful time, and appeared to my &s;oul, as it were in an in&s;tant, as a clear morning without clouds. An heavenly time I had, upon the&s;e words.

being unexpectedly recovered of his lame|ne&s;s, we &s;et out on our long journey to|wards Carolina, and he continued well all the time. I write this for the encourage|ment of &s;ome poor travellers into who&s;e hands this may fall. After three days tra|velling, we had two poor &s;mall meetings, where the life of religion &s;eemed to be al|mo&s;t, if not wholly lo&s;t, viz. Camp-Creek and Fork-Creek; we had but little &s;atis|faction in our go&s;pel labours, and endea|vours to revive true religion in the&s;e poor places. From Fork-Creek, to the fir&s;t meeting we had in the back &s;ettlements of North-Carolina, was about 235 miles. In our way thither, we had four &s;mall poor meetings, viz. Jenito, Amelia, and Ban|ni&s;ter, and a meeting at Kirby's, on the banks of Dan-River: to &s;ome of them, many of other &s;ocieties came, and go&s;pel doctrine was opened largely for their help and information; in which labour there was good &s;atisfaction; but alas! few under our name in tho&s;e parts, let the true light &s;hine before men, but were mo&s;t of them as &s;tumbling blocks in the way of &s;erious inquirers: we were enabled to clear our minds to them, and proceeded on our jour|ney. On the 29th of the 12th month, we went to New-Garden meeting, in North-Carolina, which was very large, and mo&s;tly of profe&s;&s;ors with us: a thick, dark cloud over-&s;hadowed the fore-part of that meet|ing,
<PB N="374" REF="016793_0379_0F9E6AE52737F678">
and it was a painful, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing time; mo&s;t of them &s;eemed as a&s;leep, (1 The&s;. v. 6, 7.) in the night; yet at length, through merciful kindne&s;s, truth prevailed in a good degree, and a clo&s;e awakening time it was, and many &s;eemed to be reached and tendered by the virtue of truth, and I found great ea&s;e and liberty of &s;pirit after meeting. On &s;econd-day we had a large meeting at Deep-River, mo&s;tly of profe&s;&s;ors with us, but they appeared &s;o generally void of a &s;piritual con|cern, that there appeared to me no room for truth to ari&s;e into dominion. I found it my place to &s;it the whole time in &s;ilence, which, I believe, was no &s;mall di&s;appoint|ment. On fourth-day, there being a mar|riage, we went to New-Garden again; wi&s;dom and utterance were given to &s;peak largely and with good demon&s;tration, in a very &s;earching manner to their &s;tates. On fifth-day we had a meeting at Centre; it was extremely cold, and, as &s;ome ob&s;erv|ed, the like had not been known there in the memory of man; and being quite an open meeting-hou&s;e, and very little of any thing to be felt among&s;t them of religi|ous warmth, it was really a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing time inwardly and outwardly; yet, through di|vine favour, I was pre&s;erved in a good de|gree of re&s;ignation. Next day we had a &s;mall meeting at Rocky-River. I could find very little of the wre&s;tling &s;eed there|in; we &s;at the whole meeting &s;ilent, yet a
<PB N="375" REF="016793_0380_0F9E6AE5E7EC13D8">
friend had &s;omething to offer very &s;uitable to their &s;tates. On &s;eventh-day we went to their monthly-meeting at Cane-Creek; this was large, but mo&s;t of the members &s;eemed void of a &s;olid &s;en&s;e and &s;olem|nity; a &s;pirit of &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s and con|tention was painfully felt; the leaven of the Phari&s;ee &s;eemed to prevail, and the few living &s;en&s;ible members were borne down and di&s;couraged: mo&s;t of the meeting of wor&s;hip was held in &s;ilence; yet towards the conclu&s;ion, &s;ome very clo&s;e remarks were delivered to their &s;tates, and very plain dealing in the meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s. It &s;eems to me, that when affairs of importance come before &s;uch a meeting, they are very likely to be perplexed and made wor&s;e by ill ma|nagement, which I have rea&s;on to believe has been much the ca&s;e in that meeting. I am per&s;uaded many of tho&s;e under our name have removed out of Penn&s;ylvania and other places to tho&s;e parts, in their own wills, having taken coun&s;el of their own depraved hearts, and when they have got thither, have &s;et up for &s;omething in the church; but it &s;eemed to me mo&s;t of them were very unfit for the &s;piritual build|ing, not having been hewn in the mount. We went to their meeting on fir&s;t-day, but there was much darkne&s;s and death over them; I found it my duty to &s;it the whole meeting in &s;ilence. On &s;econd-day we went to the Spring-meeting; I was led therein
<PB N="376" REF="016793_0381_0F9E6AE6A386C1D0">
largely to &s;peak upon the &s;ubject of water-bapti&s;m, which I wondered much at, as not knowing of any being there who did not profe&s;s with us; for as people in gene|ral in tho&s;e parts, clothe in a mean way, the difference is not great in their dre&s;s and appearance. After meeting, I under|&s;tood that the Bapti&s;ts gained ground much that way, and even had prevailed on &s;ome of our &s;ociety to join with them, and that their teacher was there; and al&s;o a woman brought up among&s;t us, who thought it was her duty to be baptized, but her hu&s;band oppo&s;ed it; and that the Bapti&s;t preacher took her and her hu&s;band into the meeting-hou&s;e, when the people were gone, to undo (as it was &s;uppo&s;ed) that day's work, or to prevent its having effect upon the woman: it was a time of great favour, and the one &s;aving bapti&s;m was exalted above all types, &s;igns and &s;hadows. Next day we had a &s;mall, poor meeting at the Haw|field's; and on fourth-day we had a meet|ing at Eno, which was the la&s;t we had in the upper &s;ettlement: this was a labori|ous meeting, by clo&s;e, plain-dealing with wrong &s;pirits, for which, we under&s;tood afterwards, there was a cau&s;e. On the 9th of the 1&s;t month, 1766, we &s;et out, hav|ing two guides, for the lower &s;ettlements of North Carolina, being about 200 miles, and had but two &s;mall meetings in the way, viz. Rich&s;quare, and at one Stephen's; at
<PB N="377" REF="016793_0382_0F9E6AE7961BB2D0">
the fir&s;t, many of other &s;ocieties came in; the go&s;pel was freely declared with good au|thority and clearne&s;s, to the reaching of di|vers pre&s;ent: at the other place there &s;eemed to be very little, either form or &s;ub&s;tance; we were quite &s;hut up as to mini&s;try. We got to our friend Thomas Newby's, at Piney|woods, on third-day, the 14th, being pretty much fatigued, we re&s;ted a few days there. On &s;eventh-day we went to the funeral of a woman friend, and had a meet|ing; after a time of deep wading, the word was given in coun&s;el and &s;earching doc|trine, to their &s;tates, who &s;eemed mo&s;tly to be &s;ettled in a mere form and profe&s;&s;ion: after meeting we went to our friend Thomas Nichol&s;on's. The fir&s;t-day following we were at Little-River meeting, which was large, but very low and dark in the fore-part; the profe&s;&s;ors we felt were much at ea&s;e and in a &s;tate of indifferency; yet at length, in great mercy, the ble&s;&s;ed power of truth aro&s;e, and afforded coun&s;el and doctrine &s;uited to their &s;tate. It was a &s;earching time, I hope not ea&s;ily to be for|gotten. On third-day had a large meeting at Simon's-Creek; through divine favour go&s;|pel truths were opened there, with clearne&s;s and good demon&s;tration, to the affecting of many hearts. Next day had a meeting at Newbegun, which was pretty large and open. On fifth-day we had a very large meeting at Oldneck, near the centre of
<PB N="378" REF="016793_0383_0F9E6AE866513828">
friends in this &s;ettlement, and others came together in abundance. I was &s;hut up the whole time in &s;ilence, which I apprehended they had not been much u&s;ed to. Next day we had a large meeting at Wells, in which I had a clo&s;e &s;earching time; but, alas! it &s;eemed to me that the profe&s;&s;ors of truth here-about, are many of them far gone from a lively &s;en&s;e of true religion, and are become harder to reach than people of other &s;ocieties. On fir&s;t-day, the 26th of the 1&s;t month, we had a very large meeting at Ringwood's, it being the la&s;t we were to have in Carolina; &s;ome friends came to it, I believe, from all the other meetings, with many of other &s;ocieties: at fir&s;t it was a time of painful travail, but at length the great Ma&s;ter was plea&s;ed to give wi&s;dom and &s;trength, in go&s;pel authority to open the &s;tate of the &s;ociety in tho&s;e parts, and to divide to them &s;everally; al&s;o to &s;hew, that in every di&s;pen&s;ation of God to man, he was plea&s;ed to give to tho&s;e who are &s;incerely attentive, clear evidence of his will, and approbation of their obedience; it was a highly favoured time, which, I hope, will not &s;oon be forgotten. Next day we travelled into Virginia, and on third-day had a meeting at Somerton's; the doc|trine of truth was largely opened, and &s;ome very clo&s;e remarks on the &s;tate of our &s;o|ciety; many others al&s;o being pre&s;ent: the te&s;timony had a con&s;iderable reach. Next

day we had a large meeting at the We&s;tern Branch of Nancemund: tho&s;e under our profe&s;&s;ion appeared too generally unac|quainted with the work of religion upon their hearts; many weighty truths were clo&s;ely delivered, but did not &s;eem to take &s;o much effect upon the minds of many, as could have been de&s;ired.</P>
<P>On fifth-day we had a large meeting at Black-Water; the greate&s;t number of Ne|groes were at it that I ever &s;aw at a meet|ing not appointed on purpo&s;e for them: this was a highly favoured time; the ever|la&s;ting go&s;pel was preached with clearne&s;s and good demon&s;tration, &s;hewing, that the inward and &s;piritual knowledge of God, is the &s;ub&s;tance of true religion; and that, according to the prophet, this knowledge was to cover the earth as the waters cover the &s;ea. I had great &s;atisfaction and comfort in the labour of that day. We went from hence to the quarterly-meeting at Black-Creek; the number here was large, but, alas! great deadne&s;s, in&s;en&s;ibility, and dark|ne&s;s were felt to prevail among&s;t them; clo&s;e labour, in great plainne&s;s, was u&s;ed, &s;hewing the cau&s;e thereof: among&s;t other things, that which appeared none of the lea&s;t was their keeping the negroes in perpetual &s;lavery. I was often concerned to u&s;e plain|ne&s;s in families where I went, in re&s;pect to this matter, and am &s;atisfied truth will never pro&s;per among&s;t them, nor any others,

who are in the practice of keeping this race of mankind in bondage. It is too manife&s;t to be denied, that the life of reli|gion is almo&s;t lo&s;t where &s;laves are very numerous; and it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, the practice being as contrary to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity as light is to darkne&s;s. Through divine favour, the te&s;ti|mony of truth prevails again&s;t it in mo&s;t of the American colonies, e&s;pecially in Penn&s;ylvania and the Jer&s;eys. We took meetings from this place at Burleigh, Pe|ter&s;burg, at Curl's, over James's River, Wain-Oak, John Crew's, Black-Creek, and the Swamp; mo&s;t of which were very la|borious, in a &s;orrowful &s;en&s;e that the life of religion was too generally departed from; yet in all of them, except Wain-Oak, a degree of wi&s;dom and utterance was given, to labour in the love of the go&s;pel for their help and recovery; which I hope was not altogether in vain. The next meet|ings we went to were Cedar-Creek, and Caroline, being the la&s;t we had in Virginia, they were large; not only tho&s;e under our profe&s;&s;ion attended, but al&s;o many others, as was often the ca&s;e in the&s;e parts. I think it may be truly &s;aid, the&s;e were memorable meetings: the go&s;pel was preached in the demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit and with power, which appeared to reach and tender many if not mo&s;t pre&s;ent, and my mind was com|fortably relieved from that painful weight

of death and darkne&s;s which mo&s;tly attend|ed it in the&s;e greatly corrupted colonies. On fifth-day, the 13th of the 2d month, we &s;et out for Maryland, cro&s;&s;ing Rappaha|nock-River at Port-Royal, and Patowmack, about three miles over, at How's-Ferry. We got to We&s;t-River meeting on fir&s;t-day, the 16th of the 2d month. We found very little if any thing in that meeting, of that &s;implicity and &s;elf-denial &s;o con|&s;picuous in our ancients; but a conformity to the fa&s;hions and corrupt cu&s;toms of a vain world. The go&s;pel power aro&s;e, giv|ing ability to &s;et forth the nature of Chri&s;|tianity, and how far the profe&s;&s;ors had de|viated therefrom in life and practice. The judgment of truth was &s;et over libertines and unfaithful profe&s;&s;ors thereof. The next meetings we had, were at Indian-Spring, Sandy-Spring, Elkridge, Patap&s;co, Gun-Powder, Little-Falls, Bu&s;h-River, and Deer-Creek; we were al&s;o at Deer-Creek monthly-meeting next day: in all which meetings, ability was mercifully given, to divide the word &s;uitably to the various &s;tates, which &s;eemed, in a general way, much out of the order, and from under the government of truth; yet the labour tended to &s;olid &s;atisfaction and peace; I hope it may be remembered by &s;ome to ad|vantage.</P>
<P>Thus having vi&s;ited the we&s;tern &s;hore of Maryland, we cro&s;&s;ed the great river Su&s;|quehanna,
<PB N="382" REF="016793_0387_0F9E6AEE2ED184F8">
and went to the hou&s;e of our friend John Churchman, near Ea&s;t Nottingham. On fir&s;t-day, the 2d of the 3d month, we went to that meeting, which was very large, the profe&s;&s;ors of truth being numerous here|about; to this great a&s;&s;embly, the go&s;pel of life and &s;alvation was powerfully preach|ed, &s;hewing the force of truth, how it gained the general a&s;&s;ent of people, yet few were concerned to know the &s;ame in ex|perience or practice. It was a highly fa|voured time, and the meeting &s;eemed to be generally affected. From Nottingham we went to the following meetings, viz. New-Garden, Hocke&s;&s;on, Center, and Ken|net, which were mo&s;tly large, abundance flocking to them from adjacent meetings. The travail of &s;pirit in the&s;e meetings was very deep and painful; much di&s;tre&s;&s;ing flat|ne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility were felt; yet, through merciful help, truth prevailed and largely opened doctrine and coun&s;el &s;uitable to their &s;tates; &s;hewing, there is not the lea&s;t grounds to hope for happine&s;s in a future &s;tate, unle&s;s true religion becomes the prin|cipal concern of the mind; and abundance more, in the free extendings of go&s;pel life and power, to the reaching of many hearts: everla&s;tingly adored, reverenced, and wor|&s;hipped, be infinite conde&s;cending love.

there one night, and next day to Go&s;hen monthly-meeting, which was very large; there was a great body of friends, generally under a plain appearance; but, alas! it pro|ved a painful, gloomy time of &s;ilent travail to me, the whole time of wor&s;hip; and through the meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s, though in a good degree regularly and decently con|ducted, the cloud &s;till remained; this I am per&s;uaded was occa&s;ioned by the lukewarm carele&s;s &s;tate of many members; there is great want of that living concern and holy ardour of &s;oul, which the Lord is often plea&s;ed to own in our religious meetings. The members engaging in his work, with|out his pre&s;ence to animate and endow with heavenly wi&s;dom, cannot fail of cau&s;ing thick darkne&s;s, which may be felt by tho&s;e who are truly alive and have their &s;piritual &s;en&s;es exerci&s;ed. After meeting, my valu|able companion, Thomas Ro&s;s and I part|ed for the pre&s;ent, he returning home, and I &s;taid Go&s;hen meeting, on fir&s;t-day, the 9th of the 3d month. It was very large, and in the fore-part low and cloudy; yet at length I was favoured with a degree of faith, which enabled me to &s;tand up, and as I continued in patience, I found an in|crea&s;e, with con&s;iderable enlargement to &s;peak clo&s;ely to their &s;everal &s;tates, from the&s;e words,
<Q>Tru&s;t in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not to thine own un|der&s;tanding.</Q>
But, alas! very many of

them &s;eemed to be far gone into the &s;pirit of the world, and at ea&s;e in a profe&s;&s;ion; &s;o that in&s;tead of Go&s;hen being a land of light, darkne&s;s hath prevailed in a &s;orrow|ful degree, and many are not &s;en&s;ible of it to lament it. I went from thence to Phi|ladelphia, taking Derby meeting in my way; got thither on &s;ixth-day, the 14th of the 3d month, having been on this journey about four months. I was received with affectionate kindne&s;s by my friends in that city, and attended three meetings on the fir&s;t-day following; at two of which I was &s;ilent, as was often my lot there, I believe to di&s;appoint and fami&s;h the un|&s;anctified de&s;ires and cravings of many after words. I attended their week-day meet|ings, and had con&s;iderable &s;ervice therein. On &s;eventh-day began their general Spring-meeting, which ended on third-day follow|ing; &s;ome of tho&s;e large meetings were held mo&s;tly in &s;ilence. I had then, as has often been the ca&s;e, a deep travail upon my &s;pirit, that the people might be led by the exam|ple of mini&s;ters and elders, to find the comfort and advantage of true &s;ilent wor|&s;hip, every one coming to &s;it under their own vine and under their own fig-tree, where none could make them afraid. I had, notwith&s;tanding, at &s;ome of them, good, open, public &s;ervice. I &s;taid in the city till their monthly-meeting was

over on &s;ixth-day, where I had &s;ome clo&s;e &s;ervice, and then went to the yearly-meet|ing at Wilmington, and was at four meet|ings in two days. At three of them, the truths of the go&s;pel were largely and with clearne&s;s declared, to much &s;atisfaction and comfort, I returned towards the city, at|tending Derby monthly-meeting in my way, where things appeared mournfully low; &s;ome of the active members &s;eeming very un&s;kilful in the management of the di&s;cipline: earne&s;t labour was be&s;towed, but I thought it had very little effect. On &s;ixth-day I went to the children's meeting in the city; I &s;uppo&s;e there were about 200 in all, of both &s;exes. On fir&s;t-day, the 6th of the 4th month, in company with &s;everal friends, I cro&s;&s;ed Delaware, at Glou|ce&s;ter-Point: the wind blowing very hard, it appeared dangerous; yet the boatmen be|ing very careful, through mercy we got well over, and went to Woodbury meet|ing, which was very large, and the go&s;pel power livingly aro&s;e, wherein many weighty truths were delivered, &s;hewing the great u&s;e of that propen&s;ity in man of &s;eeking after happine&s;s, if rightly directed; al&s;o, wherein true happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, and how to attain the &s;ame. It was a good time, through the gracious extendings of merci|ful regard. I went home with my near friend I&s;aac Andrews, who bore me com|pany this journey, three or four weeks in

the Jer&s;eys; we had meetings that week at Upper Greenwich, Piles-Grove, at the head of Alloway's-Creek, Salem, and Alloway's-Creek; the&s;e meetings were mo&s;tly large; great lukewarmne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility were painfully felt, many &s;eeming to re&s;t in only profe&s;&s;ing the religion of their educa|tion; for the&s;e I had a deep concern and travail of mind, that they might come to know Chri&s;t formed in them. The Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, in great kindne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion, to furni&s;h with matter and utterance in an awakening manner, in order to make them &s;en&s;ible of the nature and importance of true religion and wor|&s;hip: may it not be in vain! On fir&s;t-day, the 13th of the 4th month, we went to Greenwich meeting; the glorious go&s;pel-power eminently manife&s;ted it&s;elf that day, by clearly opening divers weighty points of doctrine, &s;uitable to the various &s;tates of that large auditory; among other things, &s;hewing that the true and &s;aving know|ledge of God, whereby we obtain the right knowledge of our&s;elves, is e&s;&s;ential to the very being of a real Chri&s;tian; and by what means that knowledge is obtained. It was a highly favoured time, for the Lord's heavenly power was over all, and the peo|ple appeared to be generally affected. Next day we had a large meeting among the Pre&s;byterians, at a place called New-Eng|land Town; their mini&s;ter having conde|&s;cended

to give notice the day before from the pulpit, of a meeting for us; he attend|ed it him&s;elf, with, I &s;uppo&s;e, mo&s;t of his hearers, who behaved &s;olid and re&s;pect|ful. The univer&s;al love of God, through Chri&s;t, to mankind, was largely &s;et forth, and people directed from outward ob&s;er|vations, to the &s;ub&s;tance, whereby victory might be obtained over &s;in: it was a fa|voured time, and the people &s;eemed gene|rally well affected and very loving, though divers things were delivered which are u&s;ually controverted between us and tho&s;e people; there was no vi&s;ible oppo&s;ition, but all pa&s;&s;ed off quiet and peaceable. On fourth-day we travelled a day's journey through the Pine-barren wilderne&s;s, to Cape-May; we had one meeting there, and two at Great Egg-Harbour. We found the number of profe&s;&s;ors &s;mall, and things, as to the life of religion, low; yet we were enabled to admini&s;ter &s;uitably to their &s;tates for their help and recovery, and had a good degree of &s;atisfaction and peace therein. On third-day, the 22d of the 4th month, we had a large meeting at Lit|tle Egg-Harbour; after a time of trying poverty and deep travail, go&s;pel life and power mercifully aro&s;e, in which, doctrine and coun&s;el flowed forth freely to divers &s;tates, particularly to a libertine&punc; youth. Next day we had a meeting in a new Pre&s;byterian meeting-hou&s;e, near Barnagatt;

At length the word was given with authority and clearne&s;s, &s;hewing the nece&s;&s;ity and advantage of &s;ilence in wor&s;hip, and di&s;tingui&s;hing Chri&s;|tians of the letter from Chri&s;tians of the &s;pirit, as al&s;o mini&s;ters of the letter from mini&s;ters of the &s;pirit; and that tho&s;e who are always ready to preach, mu&s;t either have the &s;pirit at command, or act without it. It was a great and good time; the people appeared to be generally affected, and all pa&s;&s;ed off quietly, without any oppo&s;ition. We travelled on by the &s;ea-&s;ide, to a place called Good-Luck, where we found a large meeting-hou&s;e erected though not quite fini&s;hed, by one Thomas Potter, intended by him, it &s;eems, for all preachers to make u&s;e of who would preach freely, except Papi&s;ts, who would not be admitted even on tho&s;e terms; we had a meeting in it, but notice not coming timely, nor Thomas Potter being at home him&s;elf, it was &s;mall and to little &s;atisfaction. We met him that afternoon on his return, he &s;eemed &s;orry he happened to be out at that time; he &s;ees beyond hireling mini&s;try, and I under&s;tand, inclines mo&s;t to friends of any, but joins to none. On &s;ixth-day we had a poor, low meeting, at Mone&s;quan; I doubt, but very few therein were alive in religion; &s;ome go&s;pel-labours were be&s;towed for their

help. We went after meeting to Shrews|bury, intending to be at their quarterly-meeting, which begun on fir&s;t-day, the 27th of the 4th month. It was exceed|ing large; &s;ome &s;olid friends were pre&s;ent, al&s;o many loo&s;e, libertine people under our name, and of other &s;ocieties. In that &s;ad mixture, the life of religion was exceed|ingly depre&s;&s;ed, and my mind in &s;ympathy with it: I could not wade through to get ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction that day, though I la|boured very hard. Next day the meeting was very large, the power of truth in mar|vellous kindne&s;s aro&s;e, and the go&s;pel was preached with good authority and clearne&s;s, to the various &s;tates of that great auditory. The meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s followed; there &s;eemed but little judgment to maintain good order and di&s;cipline: unity appeared not &s;o general as could have been de&s;ired. On third-day abundance of people flocked to meeting, perhaps with much expectation; but my way was &s;hut up as to mini&s;try, and but very little from any other; I found peace and &s;atisfaction by abiding in my place. On fifth-day I went to Che&s;ter|field monthly-meeting; it was very large, and I had deep and painful wading therein, in my public &s;ervice, &s;hewing what man is by nature, whatever mode or form of reli|gion he decks and adorns Him&s;elf withal; for that which is born of the fle&s;h is but fle&s;h, and cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.
<PB N="390" REF="016793_0395_0F9E6AF3A3A9DA30">
I got through at la&s;t to a pretty good de|gree of &s;atisfaction, but found much clo&s;e labour in the meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;aw great deviation from the right thing, in &s;ome high ruling members, who had car|ried an affair through that meeting again&s;t the mo&s;t lively part of the body, which they them&s;elves had &s;ufficient cau&s;e to re|pent. On &s;ixth and &s;eventh-days, I had meetings at Upper-Freehold, and New-Springfield, and on fir&s;t-day, the 4th of the 5th month, had a very large meeting at Mansfield in the morning, and another at Borden-Town in the evening. The people &s;eemed full of expectation from one come &s;o far; but it plea&s;ed the great Ma&s;ter, without who&s;e gracious aid the poor &s;er|vant can do nothing to advantage, to &s;hut me wholly up as to mini&s;try, in both places, to the great di&s;appointment of many; but there was no remedy; I dur&s;t not con|trive or form any thing for them: how|ever, I have no doubt, but &s;ilence was the mo&s;t profitable le&s;&s;on for tho&s;e meetings. I went next day to Burlington monthly-meeting, it was large and divinely favour|ed; the doctrine of truth flowed forth freely, &s;hewing what it is to be a fellow-citizen with the &s;aints and of the hou&s;hold of faith. On third-day I had a laborious meeting at Ancocas, yet had &s;ome good, open &s;ervice towards the latter-end, which &s;eemed to fa&s;ten on divers minds. I got to

Philadelphia next day, and on fifth-day, the 8th of the 5th month, went to the mar|riage of John Pemberton, and Hannah, the daughter of my worthy friends I&s;aac and Sarah Zane. It was at the great meeting-hou&s;e, being large, and there appeared too much de&s;ire and expectation after words, which often hurts meetings and blocks up the way of mini&s;ters, which &s;eemed the ca&s;e now for a while; yet at length &s;ome, I hope profitable labour was be&s;towed, from the words of our Lord,
<Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</Q>
On fir&s;t-day, the 11th of the 5th month, I attended three large meet|ings in the city, in all which, I thought it my duty to &s;et an example of &s;ilence. Near the clo&s;e of the evening meeting, it was a &s;weet refre&s;hing time; the thir&s;ty &s;oul had to drink of that river that maketh glad the whole city of God; in the enjoyment whereof, there was comfortable &s;olacing re&s;t from the painful labour of that day, and full &s;atisfaction, with thankfulne&s;s that I had been pre&s;erved in my place. I &s;taid their week-day meeting on third-day, which was large; the power and wi&s;dom of truth opened deep coun&s;el and doctrine, pointing out the different &s;tates of profe&s;&s;ors in that city, that &s;ome of the true wre&s;tling &s;eed dare not choo&s;e or contrive for them&s;elves, which way to be fed; whether immediately by the great Shepherd's own hand, or in&s;tru|mentally
<PB N="392" REF="016793_0397_0F9E6AF7E0667AB8">
by his &s;ervants; and that there were many others anxiou&s;ly choo&s;ing to be fed with te&s;timonies and outward declarati|ons, which &s;tate ought to be fami&s;hed; al&s;o, that the time would come, when the word of the Lord, by way of mini&s;try, would be very precious, and he would command the clouds to rain no rain upon &s;uch; that it was already a time of parching drought, becau&s;e of idolatry; yet the Lord would open &s;prings to the &s;eed of Jacob, in the mid&s;t of the vallies, and in his own time bring them to Rehoboth. It was a great and good time, and the meeting was much affected. I &s;et out next day for New-Eng|land, and had meetings in my way to Long-I&s;land, at Byberry, Middletown, and Stony|brook, where my old companion Thomas Ro&s;s, met me: my &s;ervice was very clo&s;e and &s;earching at the&s;e meetings. Alas! how hath an indolent &s;pirit prevailed on the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of truth; a &s;mall remnant excepted, who are pre&s;erved in mo&s;t places, to rejoice in the deep painful labours, in great mercy yet continued to the churches. We, in company with &s;everal other friends pro|ceeded on our journey, in order to attend Flu&s;hing yearly-meeting, on Long-I&s;land for the government of New-York. On fifth-day, the 22d of the 5th month, we attended the monthly and quarterly-meet|ings of mini&s;ters and elders at Flu&s;hing; in the latter I had comfortable open &s;ervice,
<PB N="393" REF="016793_0398_0F9E6AF7E75F8F30">
upon the ble&s;&s;ing pronounced by our gra|cious Redeemer to the poor in &s;pirit, &s;hew|ing the nece&s;&s;ity and u&s;efulne&s;s of that &s;tate; and al&s;o &s;etting forth the e&s;&s;ential qualifica|tions of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter. It was a ble&s;|&s;ed time, and the upright-hearted were &s;weetly comforted. Next day was held the quarterly-meeting, which was &s;mall, and things, as to the life of religion, were felt to be very low; a painful gloomine&s;s hav|ing &s;pread it&s;elf, through a want of living concern in many of the members, and from &s;ome pre&s;uming to act in the church, too much in their own will and wi&s;dom; yet the Lord who waits to be gracious, afford|ed doctrine and coun&s;el &s;uitable to their &s;tates; &s;hewing, there is one body and one &s;pirit, and that all the members who act profitably, mu&s;t know a being baptized by that one &s;pirit into the one my&s;tical body. I found great numbne&s;s in the meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s; my &s;pirit was deeply baptized in|to &s;uffering therein, and con&s;trained to lay their condition before them by very clo&s;e &s;earching ob&s;ervations, which appeared to take &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion, and my mind was much relieved thereby. On &s;eventh-day morning the yearly-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders was held, which was &s;mall, and the vital part of religion &s;eemed to be much ob&s;tructed; &s;ome clo&s;e remarks were deli|vered, which afforded con&s;iderable relief: at eleven came on the fir&s;t public meeting
<PB N="394" REF="016793_0399_0F9E6D69E2332850">
for wor&s;hip, the time of which was taken up very unprofitably by an un&s;kilful ap|pearance; after which, the bu&s;ine&s;s was entered upon, and was a painful di&s;tre&s;&s;ing time; the forward, bu&s;y, active &s;pirit of man was let loo&s;e in a few elderly per&s;ons, who had placed them&s;elves at the helm of government there, and who &s;eemed to have got &s;uch an a&s;cendancy over the meeting, as to bear down whatever appeared in the right line of tenderne&s;s and truth's &s;impli|city, when they did not &s;ee fit to promote it. The attempt was to lay a&s;ide the ne|ce&s;&s;ary queries to be an&s;wered by inferior, to &s;uperior meetings; I was favoured with a degree of wi&s;dom and &s;trength to with|&s;tand that &s;pirit, and to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of proper queries, in order that the &s;tate of the &s;ociety might be better under&s;tood: how el&s;e could &s;uitable advice be admi|ni&s;tered? But through the cowardice of many pre&s;ent, I was left to engage much alone; yet have cau&s;e to believe, that the weapons given both in the meeting and afterwards in private conference, wounded that &s;pirit deeply, and gave hone&s;t friends a clearer &s;ight of it than they had before. Things in the &s;ucceeding meetings were managed with more harmony and peace, and the meetings for wor&s;hip were very large; wherein the everla&s;ting go&s;pel was preached with clearne&s;s and demon&s;tration: many were deeply affected, and the great

<P>We went from Flu&s;hing, and had a large meeting at Cow-Neck, in which truth open|ed go&s;pel-doctrine largely, to the tendering of many hearts. Next day we had an exceeding large meeting at We&s;tbury: as there was general notice, abundance of people came from &s;everal parts of the i&s;land, &s;o that there was near as large a concour&s;e, as at the yearly-meeting; their expectations were much after words, but they had none from me, being &s;hut up in &s;ilence the whole time: the monthly-meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s was held at the clo&s;e thereof. We had very large meetings afterwards, on this i&s;land at Mati|nicock, Oy&s;ter-Bay, Bethphage, and Seque|tague; and notwith&s;tanding the low, lan|guid &s;tate of the &s;ociety, go&s;pel truths were largely delivered, and livingly opened in them. We then travelled towards the ea&s;t end of the i&s;land, on our way to Rhode-I&s;land, and on third-day, the 3d of the 6th month, went on board a ve&s;&s;el about eight o'clock in the morning, taking our hor&s;es with us, and landed &s;afe at Gratten, oppo|&s;ite to New London in the colony of Con|necticut, about one o'clock the &s;ame day. We got that night to our friend Peter Davis's, in Rhode-I&s;land government, about twenty-two miles. We had a meeting next day at We&s;terley, the governor of the pro|vince was at it and behaved kindly, in|viting
<PB N="396" REF="016793_0401_0F9E6D6A48ED9178">
us to his hou&s;e; but it did not &s;uit us to go.</P>
<P>In order to fill up our time before the yearly-meeting, we had meetings at a new meeting-hou&s;e near James Perry's, South King&s;ton, Greenwich, Ne&s;hantecut, and Providence; and though we found &s;ome hone&s;t travellers for Sion's pro&s;perity, yet, for the mo&s;t part, things, as to the life of religion, appeared mournfully low, indif|ferency prevailing in many, and divers undue liberties in others. I was much af|flicted at &s;ome of the meetings with the dark principles of dei&s;m, and was favoured with ability to lay open the wickedne&s;s and gro&s;s ab&s;urdity of &s;uch principles, warning friends and others to &s;hun the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e tinctured therewith, as they would a poi&s;onous &s;erpent. On fifth day, the 12th of the 6th month, the yearly-meeting for New-England began at Port&s;mouth on Rhode-I&s;land: this meeting was very large as to number; but, alas! it was a dark gloomy time of deep &s;uffering: the glory and diadem of our religious a&s;&s;emblies &s;eems to be &s;orrowfully removed from the&s;e people, and in&s;tead of the meeting being covered therewith, it was over&s;pread with darkne&s;s. Here I met our friend Thomas Gawthrop, who was upon his third vi&s;it to friends in America; we both &s;at the whole meeting in &s;ilence.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="016793_0402_0F9E6D6B6BD1C9E8">The meetings following, both for wor|&s;hip and di&s;cipline, were held at Newport, and continued till &s;econd day was over. The public meetings were exceeding large, both friends, and abundance of other people attended mo&s;t of them; it was &s;uppo&s;ed there were 2000 people. To the&s;e great a&s;&s;emblies it plea&s;ed the gracious fountain of all good, to open much go&s;pel doctrine in the de|mon&s;tration of the &s;pirit and with power, which appeared to be generally well re|ceived, and was to the great comfort and relief of tho&s;e engaged therein; but the meetings of mini&s;ters and elders, and tho&s;e for di&s;cipline, were for the mo&s;t part very heavy and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; great weakne&s;s and want of living concern, were painfully felt therein; little of that divine wi&s;dom which alone can build the hou&s;e, was attended to, and formality prevailed. Ability was gra|ciou&s;ly afforded to u&s;e plainne&s;s of &s;peech, endeavouring to make them &s;en&s;ible of the lo&s;s they had &s;u&s;tained, by for&s;aking the fountain of living waters, and hewing to them&s;elves ci&s;terns, broken ci&s;terns, that would hold no water: yet we found a few &s;incere labourers among&s;t them, who&s;e hands I hope were in &s;ome degree &s;trengthened; but things in general were very low. On third day we had a large &s;atisfactory meeting on Connanicut I&s;land, to which many from Newport went; and next day we had a very large meeting at Newport, which
<PB N="398" REF="016793_0403_0F9E6D6BA267BD40">
was the la&s;t we had there. In this meeting wi&s;dom and utterance were given to declare the truth to their &s;everal &s;tates, in much plain-dealing, endeavouring to &s;hew them from whence they had fallen, and how vain it was for them to imagine they were God's people in the &s;tate mo&s;t of them were then in: there was al&s;o encouragement to the few &s;incere-hearted. On fifth day we had a very large meeting at Port&s;mouth, to which came great numbers from Newport. It was a time of great darkne&s;s and deep &s;uffering with the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;eed: the young people are mo&s;tly gone into the air, and undue liberties; and tho&s;e more advanced (a few excepted) are gone into the earth; having &s;o much to do in government affairs, many of them got into the offices, friend&s;hips, and parties, as well as into the profits of this world. Next day we went off the i&s;land, and had meetings in our way to Nantucket yearly-meeting, at Tiverton, Little-Compton, and Accoake&s;et. The two la&s;t were very large, e&s;pecially Accoake&s;et; the go&s;pel was largely and with good authority declared in them to much &s;atisfaction and comfort, there being con&s;iderable openne&s;s, many of other per&s;ua&s;ions attending. On &s;econd day, being their monthly-meeting at Aponigan&s;et, and notice having been given before of our intention of being at it, it was exceeding large, even like a great yearly-meeting; it was &s;uppo&s;ed there were 2000
<PB N="399" REF="016793_0404_0F9E6D6C6C832828">
people pre&s;ent. In this large a&s;&s;embly the everla&s;ting go&s;pel was preached in the de|mon&s;tration of the &s;pirit, and with power; wi&s;dom being mercifully given to divide the word &s;uitably to the various &s;tates: the meeting appeared to be generally affected, and the minds of tho&s;e engaged greatly re|lieved. Early next morning we embarked for Nantucket, in company with about twenty friends, and landed on the &s;aid i&s;land about five o'clock in the afternoon of the &s;ame day. On &s;ixth day the yearly-meeting began, and was very large: a becoming plainne&s;s appeared in the general; but, alas! the life of religion was very much departed from by numbers in that once truly amiable place, &s;o much noted for a family of love. I went on the i&s;land as a &s;tranger to their pre&s;ent &s;tate, though I had been there twice before, a witne&s;s of better times: much di&s;tre&s;&s;ing angui&s;h was felt in this meeting, and for &s;ome time I expected the current of life would have been wholly ob&s;tructed; but at length, through divine mercy, truth aro&s;e with go&s;pel authority, &s;etting forth what a great and wonderful manife&s;tation of evangelical light and truth &s;prung up in the la&s;t century after a dark night of apo&s;ta&s;y and error; when the heavenly power being embraced, brought forth the nature and &s;pirit of religion; but endea|vours now are too often u&s;ed to &s;upport the &s;ame principles in a formal way, by the

&s;trength and wi&s;dom of man; the Lord therefore will not own a people in that &s;tate. Many things were delivered upon this &s;ub|ject with great dread, and I felt the Lord's power go forth as a fire among&s;t the briars and thorns; many were &s;truck with &s;adne&s;s and fear, and the everla&s;ting name was exalted: Thomas Gawthrop was there al&s;o, and had good &s;ervice. The meeting ended on &s;econd-day, much go&s;pel labour having been be&s;towed in the &s;everal &s;ittings thereof. Notwith&s;tanding the general &s;tate of friends on that i&s;land appeared truly deplorable, yet I believe a remnant are and will be pre&s;erved fre&s;h and lively in religion. May their number increa&s;e!</P>
<P>We left the i&s;land on third-day, the 1&s;t of the 7th month, and landed that evening at Seconne&s;&s;et, on the continent, being about fifty in number. We had a &s;mall meeting on fifth-day, at a meeting-hou&s;e near the place of our landing, and went forward to be at Sandwich quarterly-meet|ing. On &s;ixth-day we went to their monthly-meeting, where was a burial of a friend that died &s;uddenly. There were many Pre&s;byterians pre&s;ent: the go&s;pel power aro&s;e with con&s;iderable &s;trength and clearne&s;s, with the words of the apo&s;tle:
<Q>Give diligence to make your calling and election &s;ure;</Q>
with remarks on the great importance of the work, how nece&s;|&s;ary to be a&s;&s;ured of its going forward, and
<PB N="401" REF="016793_0406_0F9E6D6DDDF7D830">
that a certainty thereof may be obtained, by the &s;pirit of God bearing witne&s;s with our &s;pirit, according to the apo&s;tolic te&s;ti|mony. This exhortation contradicts the dark opinion of ab&s;olute and unconditional election and reprobation; &s;eeing this pre&s;&s;ing advice to make it &s;ure, implies &s;omething to be done on man's part, which may be omitted, and he thereby may mi&s;s the elec|tion of God's grace; whereas, according to that, the election is made &s;o certain, even from the foundation of the world, by an immutable decree, that all man's endeavours will make no alteration, &s;eeing one cannot po&s;&s;ibly be added to the number of the elect, nor one dimini&s;hed: the great ab|&s;urdity of this doctrine was expo&s;ed, &s;hew|ing how it reflected much di&s;honour on in|finite mercy and goodne&s;s; and &s;ome of their &s;tronge&s;t arguments in favour of that doc|trine were an&s;wered.</P>
<P>I was al&s;o opened upon infant-bapti&s;m, &s;o called, &s;etting forth how unrea&s;onable it is to uphold types, &s;igns, and &s;hadows, un|le&s;s we expect another and higher di&s;|pen&s;ation: that types always pointed to the anti-type or &s;ub&s;tance, and &s;eeing mo&s;t ac|knowledge the &s;ub&s;tance is come, how weak to keep up the &s;ign. It was a good time, for truth was exalted and the meeting pretty generally affected; and although the&s;e di&s;|putable points were clo&s;ely handled, yet there was no oppo&s;ition, nor the lea&s;t di&s;|gu&s;t
<PB N="402" REF="016793_0407_0F9E6D6EB1ED7E80">
appeared. On &s;eventh-day the quar|terly-meeting was held, in which we had &s;ome, I hope profitable &s;ervice, in a clo&s;e, &s;earching way; things appeared very low, yet there were &s;ome &s;incere, hone&s;t labour|ers. We went after meeting about twenty miles to Plymouth, where it is &s;aid the fir&s;t colony of Engli&s;h landed and &s;ettled. The next day, being the fir&s;t of the week, we went to Pembroke meeting, which was but &s;mall of friends, but a pretty many of other &s;ocieties came in, con&s;idering the &s;hort notice; the truths of the go&s;pel were largely delivered among&s;t them, which &s;eemed to be well and kindly received. We &s;et out after meeting, intending to pa&s;s through Bo&s;ton, and as far to the ea&s;tward as we propo&s;ed to vi&s;it friends, leaving no|tice as we went, at the &s;everal meetings, to take them in our return. We had very large meetings at Cachechy, and Dover; and although we found but little living concern among&s;t friends, yet the ble&s;&s;ed truth favoured and opened the way for much go&s;pel labour &s;uited to their &s;tates, in order to revive ancient zeal and ardour. The wea|ther was extremely hot and the meetings crouded, &s;o that at times it &s;eemed as if I &s;hould have been overcome, and faint; but by divine favour, I was mercifully carried through, to a con&s;iderable degree of &s;atis|faction and peace. We returned to their quarterly-meeting at Hampton, which be|gan
<PB N="403" REF="016793_0408_0F9E6D71BA0D8E98">
for mini&s;ters and elders, on &s;eventh-day, third hour, the 12th of the 7th month: we were &s;orrowfully affected to find &s;o little of a living concern among&s;t the leaders of the people: Next day, being the fir&s;t of the week, we had two large meetings, com|po&s;ed of friends and others: a religious la|bour for heavenly bread &s;eemed almo&s;t lo&s;t, even among&s;t tho&s;e advanced in age and pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the truth; yet in marvellous con|de&s;cen&s;ion, the go&s;pel power and life &s;prung up and extended to their various &s;tates, with great &s;trength and clearne&s;s, even as a flame of fire again&s;t the wood, hay, and &s;tubble; &s;hewing, what a great and glorious thing Chri&s;tianity is; how complete victory and dominion may be obtained by it over &s;in; and the &s;oul of man be endued with &s;ublime virtues: but to view the notion of Chri&s;ti|anity people in general appear now to be contented with, it would &s;eem as if little real religion remained on the earth. In the afternoon I was led to &s;et forth, that there is one body, one &s;pirit, one Lord, one faith, and one bapti&s;m; that by this only people come to be truly initiated, being buried with Chri&s;t by his &s;aving bapti&s;m into his death, and thereby witne&s;&s;ing with the apo&s;tle, the mea&s;ure of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t which are yet behind, fulfilled in us; if &s;o be that we &s;uffer with him, that we al&s;o may be glorified together: the deep my&s;tery of man's redemption through Chri&s;t, was

largely opened, it being a time of great fa|vour, and the people were generally affected. Next day forenoon was held their meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s; but as the power of truth, the main &s;pring of action in the weighty affairs of the church, appeared to me &s;orrowfully wanting, little could be done to good pur|po&s;e; &s;ome clo&s;e remarks were made upon the declining &s;tate of that meeting, wherein we had very little comfort or &s;atisfaction. In the afternoon we had a very large con|cluding meeting, wherein Chri&s;t was freely &s;et forth as the true light, that enlightens every man that cometh into the world; that as the light of the outward &s;un is nece&s;|&s;ary for tran&s;acting the affairs of this life, &s;o the light of the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew us how to perform the great work of our &s;oul's &s;alvation: it was a good time. We then had meetings at Aim&s;bury, Newbury, Salem, Lynn, and Bo&s;ton. At Lynn in the afternoon, being fir&s;t-day, I found it my place to &s;et an ex|ample of &s;ilence; at the other meetings I was largely opened in the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel, to good &s;atisfaction and comfort. From Bo&s;ton we travelled to Dighton, and dined on the way at Taunton. Our guide being acquainted with a &s;hop-keeper in that town, we were invited to dine with him: after dinner we entered upon much rea&s;on|ing about religious principles, and a clo&s;e di&s;pute en&s;ued. I was, through divine a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="405" REF="016793_0410_0F9E6D747100E818">
enabled to &s;tand my ground there|in, and to maintain our principles, to the comfort and &s;atisfaction of my own mind, and I believe in a good degree to his; who I un&s;ter&s;tood had been accounted a very zea|lous Pre&s;byterian, and had entertained an unfavourable opinion of our principles: he confe&s;&s;ed they never had been cleared up &s;o much to his &s;atisfaction before, and &s;eemed to be a good deal affected; we parted in love and friend&s;hip. We then had meetings at Free-town, Long-plain, Roche&s;ter, and Aku&s;hnet; in the&s;e we found things very low and languid, as appeared generally the ca&s;e in New-England; our &s;ociety, like others, having too much dwindled into form and profe&s;&s;ion. The la&s;t meeting was very large, but my way was quite &s;hut up as to mini&s;try; had in the others clo&s;e &s;earching &s;ervice. On fir&s;t-day, the 27th of the 7th month, we had a very large meeting at Swanzey, to which came friends from many parts, &s;ome even from Newport; the power of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel aro&s;e in this large a&s;&s;embly; wi&s;dom and utterance were given to declare the truth very largely, from the&s;e words,
<Q>To know thee the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent, is life eternal.</Q>
The meeting was much affected; the Lord's heart-melting goodne&s;s was &s;weetly enjoyed by a remnant. Next day we had a large meeting at Smithfield; the nature of true religion, from the apo&s;|tle
<PB N="406" REF="016793_0411_0F9E6D74A7C96108">
James's definition of it, was copiou&s;ly treated of in this meeting: it was a favoured time, and the meeting was generally af|fected. On third-day we had a meeting at Wain&s;oket, great numbers of loo&s;e, liber|tine people came, who, I &s;uppo&s;e, rarely attended any place of wor&s;hip; &s;uch came rather out of curio&s;ity, expecting &s;ome|thing; and indeed tho&s;e, for the mo&s;t part, who profe&s;s with us there, &s;eem as if they knew little of the nature and importance of religious wor&s;hip; but it was my duty in this large meeting, to &s;it in &s;ilence. Next day we had a very large meeting at Mendam, to which came many of our pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and a great number of &s;uch as be|ing di&s;&s;atisfied with the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip, and an hireling mini&s;try, had &s;eparated and held meetings in one another's hou&s;es, hav|ing &s;uch as thought it their duty to preach freely among&s;t them: to this meeting the go&s;pel was largely preached, which &s;eemed to have a general reach. After meeting came a prede&s;tinarian, and a young man, a preach|er among tho&s;e &s;eparati&s;ts before-men|tioned, who are quite aver&s;e to that dark opinion: the&s;e two, it &s;eems, had been en|gaged in a di&s;pute in the meeting-hou&s;e when all were gone, upon &s;ome points of doctrine delivered that day concerning ori|ginal &s;in and the opinion before-mention|ed; and as they could not &s;ettle the points, at length they agreed to come to my quar|ters,
<PB N="407" REF="016793_0412_0F9E6D756A9ED3E0">
to a&s;k me a few &s;ober que&s;tions, by way of further explanation of &s;ome things delivered. When they informed me of the rea&s;on of their coming, I told them I was very willing to afford them all the &s;atisfac|tion in my power, but was not very fond of di&s;putes, which &s;eldom tended much to edification as they were generally managed. The old man &s;ignified he had no intention of entering into any di&s;putes; however, one thing brought on another, till we got very clo&s;ely engaged: the young man, the preach|er, was on my &s;ide, and, I think, had as remarkable a memory in the &s;criptures as I ever knew, and was favoured with a con&s;i|derable under&s;tanding in the my&s;tery of them. The poor old man, though I &s;up|po&s;e as well furni&s;hed as mo&s;t upon &s;uch a bad &s;ubject, was entirely vanqui&s;hed and confounded to that degree, that his &s;pirits appeared to be &s;unk with &s;orrow, becau&s;e he could not &s;upport his principles better. The young man and I, with other friends, withdrew into another room, and had a religious conference, particularly upon the nature of go&s;pel-mini&s;try and wor&s;hip; he appeared to be much enlightened and not far from the kingdom; but I fear he had entered into the mini&s;try too &s;oon. This opportunity afforded my mind a good deal of &s;atisfaction. I found many of tho&s;e high profe&s;&s;ors in New-England, in rather an un&s;ettled &s;tate&punc; fond of flocking to our
<PB N="408" REF="016793_0413_0F9E6D761F2B2BF8">
meetings, and they &s;eemed to hear the doc|trines of truth with &s;atisfaction, and there was great openne&s;s among&s;t them in many places. But what &s;orrowfully affected my mind was, that there is &s;o little of the life of religion held up as a &s;tandard to tho&s;e, by our &s;ociety in tho&s;e parts; yet I believe there will be a gathering to Shiloh, in the New-England colonies. The difference ap|pears very great in their e&s;teem and regard to our friends, to what it was formerly, though perhaps that in part may be owing to many in our &s;ociety being more like them, than our friends were in early times; yet I believe the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e with many, and that it ari&s;es from their good opinion of mo&s;t of our principles.</P>
<P>On fifth-day, the 31&s;t of the 7th month, we &s;et out, accompanied by two guides, through the back parts of Connecticut, to|wards the Oblong in the government of New-York, being about 140 miles through a Pre&s;byterian country; they generally carried them&s;elves civilly, and we had &s;ome religious conferences to good &s;atisfaction. The wea|ther was very hot, and the roads &s;tony, rough and mountainous, and the entertainment but mean in many places, &s;o that the jour|ney was attended with fatigue to our bodies and hor&s;es. We went to New-Milford meeting on fir&s;t-day, the 3d of the 8th month; I had nothing to offer by way of mini&s;try, yet in &s;till quiet waiting, I was
<PB N="409" REF="016793_0414_0F9E6D76F7EB3B38">
favoured therein with the fir&s;t clear &s;atis|factory glance of my being at liberty, to|wards the latter end of this year, to return home, which I fully believed, but kept it to my&s;elf. After meeting we a&s;cended to the Oblong, and a long a&s;cent it was, of near a mile to the &s;ummit of that cal|led Quaker-Hill; the weather being ex|tremely hot, I feared it would have killed my hor&s;e, and I was not able to relieve him by walking. On third-day we had a very large meeting at a commodious hou&s;e built by friends on that hill; they who attend|ed were generally profe&s;&s;ors of the truth as held by us, and mo&s;tly plain and becom|ing in their outward garb; yet, alas! when they came to be viewed in the true light, they appeared dry and formal; many, I fear, having clothed corrupted nature with a form of religion, and in a plain dre&s;s fit in their religious meetings like dead images. After a time of deep &s;uffering in &s;pirit with the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;eed, the word was given with good authority, and went forth like a flame of fire, again&s;t the wood, hay, and &s;tubble, to the rou&s;ing, I believe, and awa|kening of many for the pre&s;ent. The con|dition of man in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion as &s;et forth by the in&s;pired writers, that he is in a &s;tate of enmity to, and &s;eparation from God, con&s;equently, he mu&s;t experience a very great change, before he can be accept|able to his Maker: the way was opened,
<PB N="410" REF="016793_0415_0F9E6D779CD93548">
&s;hewing how this change was to be effected, and that the operation nece&s;&s;ary thereunto, makes indelible impre&s;&s;ions on the minds of all who are &s;o happy as to experience the &s;ame, that none can be true Chri&s;tians without it; truth had great dominion that day. We had a very large meeting next day at the Nine Partners, and had clo&s;e &s;ervice therein. Next day we had a very painful afflicting meeting at O&s;wego; I was quite a &s;tranger to them, and did not know by any outward information, that they had any one who u&s;ually appeared in public among them; yet my mind was &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e, that the meeting had been much hurt by a wrong mini&s;try, and for that rea&s;on chiefly, my mouth was &s;hut up there in that re&s;pect: it &s;eemed as if the very per&s;on was &s;hewn to me in the meet|ing, though I had never &s;een him before that I know of; but I found afterwards, it was a true &s;en&s;e, and I told friends in his hearing, how things appeared to me in that meeting, which &s;eemed to &s;trike him, and he &s;truggled a little, but I left it upon him: may the great and gracious helper of his people, have the prai&s;e of his own works, &s;aith my &s;oul, now and for evermore! On fir&s;t-day, the 10th of the 8th month, we were at the Oblong meeting again; my travail the whole meeting was in &s;uffering &s;ilence. From hence, in our way to New-York, we had the following meetings, viz.
<PB N="411" REF="016793_0416_0F9E6D7A39FF0008">
Peach-Pond, North-Ca&s;tle, the monthly-meeting at the Purcha&s;e, Momarineck, and We&s;t-Che&s;ter; at mo&s;t of which, the go&s;|pel power was largely manife&s;ted, by open|ing doctrine and coun&s;el, in a clo&s;e, &s;earch|ing manner, to the various &s;tates of the people. On fir&s;t-day, the 17th of the 8th month, we were at two meetings in the city of New-York; in the morning I was &s;ilent; in the afternoon, truth opened the way to public &s;ervice, &s;hewing the beau|tiful order and economy of human life; all &s;eeking for &s;ome man&s;ion, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or &s;ettlement, and agreeable to the laws of pru|dence and ju&s;tice, endeavouring to increa&s;e their &s;tore, that they may have &s;omething of their own again&s;t the time of need: if prudence requires to provide the nece&s;&s;aries for this &s;hort and uncertain life, how much more incumbent is it upon us, in regard to the immortal part: and that our eyes &s;hould be turned to view the order, har|mony, and beauty of the new creation, and to &s;eek an inheritance in the holy city? It was a ble&s;&s;ed time, and many hearts were tendered. I had a good deal of &s;atisfaction among friends in that city, and hope there is a growth in the be&s;t things experienced by divers. On &s;econd-day we cro&s;&s;ed the Bay, and Staten-I&s;land; ferried from thence at Elizabeth-town Point, and went to Rahway. On third and fourth-day we went to the quarterly and monthly-meetings at Woodbridge; was enabled to labour largely
<PB N="412" REF="016793_0417_0F9E6D7B070EF9F0">
in a &s;earching way, with much plainne&s;s and go&s;pel authority, for their help and recovery from a weak, languid, uncon|cerned &s;tate; yet we found &s;ome &s;olid, valu|able friends among&s;t them. From thence we proceeded on our way to my compani|on's hou&s;e in Penn&s;ylvania, and had large meetings at Plainfield and Kingwood, wherein the go&s;pel was preached with great openne&s;s, to good &s;atisfaction. On &s;eventh-day evening, the 23d of the 8th month, having cro&s;&s;ed Delaware at Howell's-Ferry, we got to my companion's hou&s;e, and at|tended two meetings at Wright's-Town, where he belongs; the next day there was a con&s;iderable number of profe&s;&s;ors, but &s;piritual idlene&s;s was felt &s;orrowfully to have prevailed over too many, craving to be fed with words; I found it my duty to be &s;ilent at both the meetings. Having taken a very great cold after &s;ome of the late large and hot meetings, I was much indi&s;|po&s;ed, and &s;taid at my companion's till fifth-day, and then went to the quarterly-meet|ing for the county of Bucks, held at the Falls, which was exceeding large: truth greatly favoured that meeting, in opening doctrine and coun&s;el, for the help, reproof, and encouragement of many, beginning with the&s;e words, <HI>It is e&s;pecially worthy to be noted, that the in&s;pired writers, both in relating their own experience, and in ad|mini&s;tering advice and coun&s;el to others, on a religious account, lay the whole &s;tre&s;s

of religion upon the inward, &s;aving, and &s;piritual knowledge of God:</HI> it was a great time, and many hearts were tendered. The youth's meeting was held next day at Bri&s;|tol; it was a low, poor time, and I had nothing to offer by way of mini&s;try. On fir&s;t-day, the 31&s;t of the 8th month, I went to Makefield meeting, it was an exer|ci&s;ing time; a carele&s;s, earthly &s;pirit was felt to be very prevalent; I had &s;ome &s;er|vice there, in a very clo&s;e, &s;earching man|ner. In the afternoon I had a very large meeting at John Beaumont's, wherein much go&s;pel doctrine flowed to the people, upon the nature of &s;elf-denial and bearing the yoke of Chri&s;t; many, not of our &s;ociety, were pre&s;ent and pretty much affected; it was a favoured time. Next day I went to Buckingham monthly-meeting, which was very large, a numerous body of friends living in tho&s;e parts; I had great openne&s;s for public &s;ervice therein, &s;hewing, that the promi&s;es of God in him, are yea and amen for ever; yet we are not entitled to them but upon certain conditions, that is, being in tho&s;e &s;tates to which they are ap|plied. It was a great and good time, truth being exalted. On third-day I had a large meeting at Plum&s;tead, many attending from Buckingham and other places. The word was given with authority and clearne&s;s, to declare to this numerous auditory, upon the nature of true religion and wor&s;hip, &s;hewing, that it principally con&s;i&s;ted in an
<PB N="414" REF="016793_0419_0F9E6D7CE12BAB30">
inward exerci&s;e of the &s;oul towards God, and e&s;pecially depended on a &s;piritual ac|quaintance with him; it was a highly fa|voured time, and many hearts were tender|ed. For &s;ome time pa&s;t I had been indi&s;|po&s;ed, being, through the extremity of the heat, much afflicted with a ra&s;h, called the prickly heat; and having taken a great cold, my a&s;thmatic di&s;order was much increa&s;ed; yet, through merciful help &s;upporting &s;oul and body in the great work to which I was called, I was enabled to proceed on my journey, having a &s;trong de&s;ire to vi&s;it &s;ome meetings in the back parts of Bucks, Phi|ladelphia, and Che&s;ter counties, before the approaching yearly-meeting for Penn&s;ylvania and the Jer&s;eys, to be held in Philadelphia towards the latter end of the 9th month: apprehending if I could accompli&s;h that, I &s;hould have little to do after, except on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of Maryland and in the lower counties upon Delaware. Here my valu|able friend Zebulon He&s;ton, joined me for a companion to the back parts. We tra|velled next day to Richland, and the day following had a large meeting there, mo&s;tly con&s;i&s;ting of tho&s;e under our name: great lukewarmne&s;s and want of a living con|cern was felt; yet it plea&s;ed divine good|ne&s;s to favour with ability to labour in the go&s;pel with plainne&s;s, in a very awakening manner, which &s;eemed to have &s;ome ten|dering effect in the general, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent. We travelled next day to Oley,
<PB N="415" REF="016793_0420_0F9E6D7DA9891A38">
alias Exeter, and went to their meeting on fir&s;t-day, the 7th of the 9th month; they appeared to me mo&s;tly ignorant of the im|portance of that wor&s;hip and &s;ervice which they pretended to meet about, and as if the chief waiting was to hear what the poor &s;ervants had to &s;ay: they were di&s;appointed in re&s;pect to me, finding it my place to &s;it the whole meeting in &s;ilence. We after|wards went to Maiden-Creek, and had a large meeting there the next day. I believe there were &s;ome valuable friends, but many ap|peared in a &s;tate of indolence as to reli|gion, looking for words; there was a con|&s;iderable &s;pace of &s;ilence; at length, truth aro&s;e and obtained dominion, and the go&s;|pel was freely preached; &s;hewing the na|ture of the work of man's &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, and the great danger of a neglect thereof. On third-day we had a meeting in Reading Court-Hou&s;e, to which many came, not of our &s;ociety, being mo&s;tly Ger|mans, who behaved in a &s;olid, becoming manner; the word of the go&s;pel was given, and ability to declare it with good autho|rity and clearne&s;s for a con&s;iderable time, to the tendering of many hearts. Next day we cro&s;&s;ed Schuylkill, and had meetings at the Fore&s;t, Nantmill, Providence, and Pikeland, in all which, ability was given to labour in the go&s;pel, for the &s;tirring up profe&s;&s;ors to a more lively &s;en&s;e of religion, which indeed was felt to be at a low ebb among&s;t them, as in many other places;
<PB N="416" REF="016793_0421_0F9E6D7E6371B330">
&s;uch cau&s;es there are of mournful com|plaints, where people go no deeper into reli|gion than what comes by education or out|ward conformity: many in the&s;e parts have entered into the outward po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and profe&s;&s;ion of their worthy ance&s;tors, at a very ea&s;y rate; yet the Lord, in great mercy, is cau&s;ing his trumpets to found very loud, to awaken &s;uch to a &s;en&s;e of their danger. On fir&s;t-day, the 14th of the 9th month, we went to Uwchlan, which was a very large meeting of it&s;elf, and friends came to it from mo&s;t of the adjacent meetings; the fore part was a time of deep travail and &s;ilent labour, in a painful &s;en&s;e that many pre&s;ent were at ea&s;e in a bare profe&s;&s;ion of the truth; at length the word was given with con&s;iderable weight and go&s;pel autho|rity, &s;hewing what a powerful efficacious thing Chri&s;tianity was, when it made its fir&s;t entrance into the world, and &s;o con|tinued for a con&s;iderable time, mightily prevailing by its own force and efficacy, again&s;t all oppo&s;ition and worldly intere&s;t, until the world &s;miled upon its profe&s;&s;ors: it then &s;pread as to the name, but gradual|ly lo&s;ing the power and life, many di&s;or|ders, great corruptions, and de&s;olating con|tentions about trifles, got in. Clo&s;e ap|plication was made to the &s;tates of the inhabitants of this highly favoured pro|vince, earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ing the auditory to &s;eek after the &s;ub&s;tance of religion. The afternoon meeting was &s;olid and comfort|able
<PB N="417" REF="016793_0422_0F9E6D7F1FFA0518">
in &s;ilence. On third-day we had a large meeting at Ea&s;t-Caln, in which I had tho|rough &s;ervice, to good &s;atisfaction; and next day we had a very large meeting at Brad|ford, in the Forks of Brandy-wine; things were felt to be much out of order, and re|ligion to be at a very low ebb among&s;t them, yet, through infinite conde&s;cen&s;ion, go&s;pel authority was given, with much clearne&s;s in doctrine, &s;hewing, that in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s a valuable religion, man &s;hould be feelingly and experimentally convinced, that in matters of religion, he mu&s;t wholly re&s;ign his will to God, and give him|&s;elf up to be guided by a &s;upernatural prin|ciple; until then, he cannot &s;ay, with ac|ceptance to his Maker,
<Q>Thy will be done in earth, as it is done in heaven.</Q>
It was, through divine mercy, a highly-fa|voured baptizing time, and the ble&s;&s;ed truth was in dominion over hard, unmortified &s;pirits. I went home from hence with my brother-in-law, Micajah Speakman, to Con|cord, where I re&s;ted quietly three days, after long fatigue of travelling and hard labour; yet all was made ea&s;y through the efficacy of that heavenly power which mer|cifully attended from place to place, filling my &s;oul, at times, with true contentment and perfect re&s;ignation to the Lord's will, either to do or &s;uffer; in which happy &s;tate, my peace flowed as a river, On fir&s;t-day, the 21&s;t of the 9th month, I went to Mid|dle-town meeting, but had no public &s;er|vice
<PB N="418" REF="016793_0423_0F9E6D8014D44E50">
therein. I went on &s;econd-day to Philadelphia, attended their week-day meet|ing next day, and on fifth-day I went to Haddonfield, in We&s;t-Jer&s;ey, to the burial of Thomas Redman, a public friend in good e&s;teem, who formerly told me he was fir&s;t reached or convinced through my mini&s;try, in the Bank-meeting at Philadel|phia, about thirty years ago: the meeting was very large, con&s;i&s;ting both of friends and tho&s;e of other &s;ocieties, a prie&s;t and his family being there; the truths of the go&s;pel were largely declared, with clearne&s;s and good demon&s;tration; the auditory being very &s;olid and attentive, truth had good dominion to the comfort of many. In the afternoon was held their quarterly-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders; it was a low time. Next day was held their quarterly-meeting, which was very large; there &s;eemed to be great expectations and looking out after words, as is &s;orrowfully the ca&s;e with many in the&s;e parts, e&s;pecially if the poor in&s;tru|ment had been favoured before, and it plea&s;ed them: this &s;ometimes tends to de|prive them of that which they &s;o anxiou&s;ly &s;eek after, which I believe was now the ca&s;e, for I was quite &s;hut up as to public &s;ervice, but had &s;ome good &s;ervice in the meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s. On &s;eventh-day, the 27th of the 9th month, I went to the year|ly-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders at Phi|ladelphia, for Penn&s;ylvania and the Jer&s;eys; it was large, I had &s;ome &s;ervice therein,
<PB N="419" REF="016793_0424_0F9E6D80DE97A270">
and informed friends that I expected liber|ty to return home that Fall, reque&s;ting a few lines by way of certificate, to my friends in England, according to the good order u&s;ed among&s;t us; this was the only one I reque&s;ted on the continent of Ame|rica, yet friends, of their own accord, &s;ent certificates from mo&s;t or all the parts I vi&s;ited. A certificate was readily granted, and &s;igned by a great number of mini&s;ters and elders, te&s;tifying their unity with my go&s;pel labours and conduct while among them. I diligently attended the &s;everal &s;ittings of this yearly-meeting, both for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, and had &s;ome weighty &s;ervice in them. On fir&s;t-day, the 5th of the 10th month, I went to Fair-hill meeting, and returned to the evening meeting in the city. On third-day, the 7th of the 10th month, I &s;et out in order to attend the yearly-meeting on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of Maryland, being accompanied by Samuel Ea&s;tburn; we had meetings in our way at George's-Creek, and the head of Sa&s;&s;afras; truth made way for clo&s;e, weigh|ty &s;ervice, to the &s;tates of tho&s;e pre&s;ent. We went, the 11th of the 10th month, to a &s;mall poor meeting for mini&s;ters and el|ders, at Cecil, in Maryland; and next day being the fir&s;t of the week, the yearly-meeting began there, to which came many people of divers &s;orts, mo&s;t of whom &s;eem|ed loo&s;e, and void of a &s;olid, religious con|cern.

in the general, yet the go&s;pel power, in great mercy, broke through, and opened &s;uitable doctrine to their &s;tates, &s;hewing the general con&s;ent of all ages and nations, to that of the immortality of the &s;oul and future rewards and puni&s;hments; and al|though the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity were favoured with more clear apprehen&s;ions thereof, than others, yet numbers of them live as if they had no &s;uch belief, or, as if they did not look upon them&s;elves to be ac|countable creatures. The &s;ucceeding meet|ings, both for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, were, I hope, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, profitable to many. The yearly-meeting at Chop-tank began on &s;eventh-day, the 18th of the 10th month, and ended on fourth-day afternoon; many of the meetings were very large, and the truths of the go&s;pel powerfully declared in them, and the ever|la&s;ting unchangeable truth was exalted over all of a contrary nature to it&s;elf: this year|ly-meeting afforded great relief and &s;ati&s;|faction to my mind. We &s;et out on fifth-day, in order to attend the yearly-meeting to be held at Little-Creek, in Kent-Coun|ty, on Delaware; the meeting began on fir&s;t-day, the 26th of 10th month, and held two days; I had very open &s;ervice therein. After this meeting I found my&s;elf at liberty to &s;eek a proper opportunity to return to my native land and outward habitation, and &s;o went from hence directly toward Philadelphia; I attended their monthly and
<PB N="421" REF="016793_0426_0F9E6D839B100638">
quarterly-meeting there, wherein I had good open &s;ervice. By inquiring, I found a ve&s;&s;el bound for London, the captain in|tending to &s;ail about the middle of the 11th month. I went on board, accompanied by divers friends; we &s;at a while in the cabin, in a &s;olemn &s;ilence; my mind was deeply engaged to be rightly directed; and finding, as I thought, rather a freedom to go in that &s;hip, I therefore &s;ignified to the cap|tain and the owners, that I intended to em|bark in her, which they appeared to be well plea&s;ed with. I then went to Che&s;ter-County, to take leave of my relations and friends, and to attend the quarterly-meet|ing at Concord; which I did, and had large open &s;ervice in the &s;everal meetings, to great &s;atisfaction and comfort. On third-day I went to a large meeting at Che&s;ter; death and darkne&s;s &s;eemed to reign the whole time, &s;o that I had no power to move, as to mini&s;try. I got to Philadelphia next morn|ing, the &s;hip being to &s;ail from thence the next day. On &s;ixth-day, about nine o'clock, I took a &s;olemn leave of &s;undry valuable friends in the city, and &s;et out for Che&s;ter to meet the &s;hip; many friends from thence and Derby, accompanying me thither; where, after dinner, in near affection we took leave, never expecting to &s;ee each other again. I then embarked on board the &s;hip Phebe, Capt. Mungo Davi&s;on; we got under &s;ail about two o'clock next morning, and on fir&s;t-day, the 16th of the 11th month,
<PB N="422" REF="016793_0427_0F9E6D8463B4A000">
about four o'clock in the afternoon, we got to &s;ea.</P>
<P>I find this remark among&s;t my memo|randums, written, I &s;uppo&s;e, after I had been &s;ome time at &s;ea, viz. "It is fit to be re|membered, in humble and awful acknow|ledgment, that the Lord has been with me ever &s;ince I came on board this &s;hip, in love and mercy un&s;peakable, cau&s;ing &s;weet peace to flow as a river in my &s;oul, &s;o as to make me forget all my former angui&s;h. For the former things are all pa&s;&s;ed away, &s;o that, through infinite conde&s;cending love, I have learned to &s;ing the &s;ong of Mo&s;es and the &s;ong of the Lamb, and even upon the mighty foaming un&s;table ocean, to &s;peak in my&s;elf in p&s;alms, and hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs, making melody in my heart to the Lord, who hath been plea&s;ed to pre&s;erve me through many, oh! very many heights and depths; heights in my &s;ervice and affections of my friends and others, I hope from being lifted up or exalted above mea|&s;ure, by the revelation I have been favoured with; and through the deep bapti&s;ms I have experienced, in &s;ympathy with the preci|ous depre&s;&s;ed &s;eed, borne down and pre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ins of mankind, as a cart is pre&s;&s;ed with &s;heaves; the Lord enabling me to be re|&s;ignedly contented in that &s;tate: whether in &s;uffering or rejoicing, &s;ilence or words, he mercifully gave me this &s;upport by the power of his own &s;pirit, and now is &s;o gracious, as to reward my mind with &s;weet
<PB N="423" REF="016793_0428_0F9E6D85893982E0">
peace for abiding in that &s;tation wherein he alone pre&s;erved me. I was, through un&s;peakable kindne&s;s, when I &s;at down in a meeting, mo&s;tly enabled to &s;ay, "Thy will be done, whether in making u&s;e of me as thy in&s;trument to &s;ound an alarm to the people, or to &s;et them an example of &s;ilent waiting upon thee." What &s;hall I &s;ay or return to the Lord of everla&s;ting loving-kindne&s;s for pre&s;ervation, by &s;ea and by land, in many perils; I am at a lo&s;s for expre&s;&s;ions to &s;et forth his bountiful good|ne&s;s, and the greatne&s;s of his love and mercy to tho&s;e who tru&s;t in him. I there|fore humbly de&s;ire with &s;ilent reverence, or otherwi&s;e as ability is afforded, to mag|nify, wor&s;hip, and adore him, who is glo|rious in holine&s;s, and fearful in prai&s;e, working wonders, who alone is worthy now and evermore! Amen."</P>
<P>We had a &s;trong new &s;hip which had been at &s;ea but one voyage before; &s;he was very tight in the river and bay, but we had not been a week at &s;ea before &s;he &s;prung a leak to that degree, as to require much labour to clear her of water. This &s;eemed to affect the captain and the pa&s;&s;engers pretty much, not knowing but the leak would increa&s;e, and we being but poorly manned, the cap|tain having been deceived in &s;ome whom he had taken in for good hands, proving of little u&s;e, nay, one of them rather a bur|den. In this gloomy time, through mer|ciful help, I found a ble&s;&s;ed &s;upport to my
<PB N="424" REF="016793_0429_0F9E6D85DE2DCCB0">
mind, in humble confidence, that he who is Lord of all (in who&s;e coun&s;el I appre|hended I was there) would conduct me &s;afe to my outward habitation; yet I was &s;orry for &s;uch an addition of work to the &s;ailors, as we were obliged to keep one hand at lea&s;t at the pump night and day all the pa&s;&s;age, which was &s;tormy and rough, and very un|plea&s;ant to the body. The captain and pa&s;|&s;engers were very civil and obliging to me. It was the 19th of the 12th month, before we found our&s;elves in &s;oundings on the Engli&s;h coa&s;t. After we had &s;ailed a con|&s;iderable way up the Channel, the wind came a-head of us, &s;o that we beat about therein for &s;everal days, and were once in great danger of being &s;hipwrecked upon the I&s;land of Alderney. On the 25th of the 12th month, in the evening, we put into the &s;afe port of Dartmouth. I then re|&s;olved to leave the &s;hip, being about 230 miles from home, where I arrived the la&s;t day of the year, 1766, having been upon this journey one year and a half, lacking a few days. I under&s;tood it was &s;ix or &s;even weeks before the &s;hip arrived at London, after I left her.</P>
<P>As I have already far exceeded in large|ne&s;s, what I intended to leave behind me in the way of Journal, &s;o I mu&s;t forbear adding much more; yet may ju&s;t hint, that in the year 1768, I went to the quarterly-meetings of York, Kendal, and Lanca&s;ter. I had divers other meetings in the North,
<PB N="425" REF="016793_0430_0F9E6D86A1542A60">
and, accompanied by my worthy friend Samuel Fothergill, had &s;everal meetings in North Wales, in town-halls, where none under our name re&s;ided. I pa&s;&s;ed afterwards through a part of England, into South Wales, and &s;o to Bri&s;tol; from thence I returned home; having pa&s;&s;ed through, in England and Wales, about twenty-five counties, and attended &s;ixty-three meet|ings, and travelled about 1016 miles.</P>
<P>In the 4th month, 1770, I &s;et out, ac|companied by my wife, intending to be at the circular yearly-meeting, to be held this year at Orm&s;kirk, in Lanca&s;hire. We were at Manche&s;ter meetings on fir&s;t-day, and attended a very large monthly-meeting on the &s;econd-day following, at Warrington. Truth and its te&s;timony was exalted, and had great dominion therein over libertine &s;pi|rits, to the joy of the upright in heart. The yearly-meeting before mentioned be|gan the 17th of the &s;ame month, and held three days: there was a very convenient booth erected for the purpo&s;e, which, it was thought, would accommodate 2000 people; yet it was not &s;ufficient to contain the numbers who came, &s;o that other meet|ings were held out in the open air at the &s;ame time. The people in general behaved with civility and re&s;pect; there was con|&s;iderable openne&s;s, and the meetings were well conducted. We returned from thence homewards, taking Warrington meeting on fir&s;t-day: the journey was very &s;atisfactory&punc; the whole being about 488 miles.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="016793_0431_0F9E6D8781930F98">In the year 1772, I went, in company with my friends Sarah and Deborah Morris of Philadelphia, to the yearly-meeting at Bri&s;tol; it was large and divinely favoured. I attended, this year, four other yearly-meet|ings, to very good &s;atisfaction and comfort, viz. London, Colche&s;ter, Woodbridge, and Norwich, accompanied by my wife to the la&s;t four, as well as by the two friends before-mentioned, who were in this na|tion upon a religious vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Being now in the &s;ixtieth year of my age, and having laboured twelve or four|teen years, at times, pretty much under an a&s;thmatic complaint, which has cau&s;ed riding to be frequently painful to the body, which difficulty age is likely to increa&s;e, I expect therefore, travelling of any con|&s;iderable journies will of cour&s;e cea&s;e: and having written &s;o much already, I here intend to lay down my pen, committing my&s;elf, and what is done, to the provi|dence and ble&s;&s;ing of God, in who&s;e power alone it is to grant patience, re&s;ignation, and per&s;everance, to his poor, helple&s;s &s;er|vants, and an increa&s;e of their go&s;pel la|bours: So be it!</P>
