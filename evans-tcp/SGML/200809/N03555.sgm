<P>&mdash;Compel them to come in.&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IT was a common Thing with our <HI>Saviour,</HI> to di&s;cour&s;e to his Hearers in <HI>parabolical</HI> Language: And his View herein (at lea&s;t in Part) might be to accommodate him&s;elf to their Capacities, and take greater Hold on their Hearts; For there is no Way of Speaking, that more ea&s;ily and familiarly conveys Truth into the Mind, or more &s;trongly impre&s;&s;es it there.</P>
<P>The Words I have &s;elected to employ our pre&s;ent Meditations, are Part of the <HI>Parable of the Supper:</HI> Concerning which, it may &s;uffice to ob&s;erve in general,
<PB N="2" REF="004349_0004_10044F8F80F82B40">
That the Ble&s;&s;ings of the <HI>Go&s;pel-State</HI> are here com|pared to a <HI>Supper</HI>: The Per&s;ons <HI>fir&s;tly</HI> invited to it were the <HI>Jews</HI>; but the&s;e making light of the In|vitation, and excu&s;ing them&s;elves from an Attendance at it, the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were then called in, the Gentiles of <HI>all Sorts and Kinds</HI>; and this, while the <HI>Jews</HI> were left under that Blindne&s;s of Mind and Hardne&s;s of Heart, in which they continue to this Day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Text</HI> falls in that Part of the Parable, which concerns the <HI>Gentiles</HI>; and is a Command to <HI>enforce</HI> their Acceptance of the <HI>Go&s;pel Offer of Mercy,</HI> with all the Methods of <HI>Per&s;wa&s;ion,</HI> with all the <HI>Motives</HI> and <HI>Arguments,</HI> &s;uited to work upon the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> of Men. Says our Lord to the Ser|vant, <HI>Compel them to come in</HI>: In di&s;cour&s;ing to which Words, I &s;hall do two Things.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Explain to you the Meaning of that Compul&s;ion, which our Saviour here recommends.</HI> And then,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Do the Duty enjoin'd the Servant in the Text, by endeavouring to compel you to come in, and partake of the Go&s;pel Supper.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>I am to explain to you the Meaning of that Compul&s;ion, which our Saviour here recommends.</HI> Says he to the Servant in my Text, <HI>Compel them to come in.</HI> But what are we to under&s;tand by this <HI>Compul|&s;ion?</HI> Of what <HI>Sort of Compul&s;ion</HI> does our Lord &s;peak?</P>
<P>Now, 'tis plain, he here &s;peaks, not of <HI>phy&s;ical,</HI> but <HI>moral</HI> Compul&s;ion; not of Compul&s;ion by <HI>outward Vio|lence,</HI> but <HI>internal Per&s;ua&s;ion</HI>; that which is effected, not by <HI>Fines, Impri&s;onments, Racks</HI> and <HI>Tortures,</HI> but by Application to the <HI>Under&s;tandings</HI> of Men. The
<PB N="3" REF="004349_0005_10044FC44CD552F8">
<HI>Compul&s;ion,</HI> our Saviour intends, is of that Kind, which the <HI>Mind of</HI> Man is capable of, and is &s;utable to it as <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>intelligent</HI>: And this is Compul&s;ion by <HI>&s;ound Rea&s;oning, good Argument.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Compel them to come in</HI>; 'Tis is if our Lord had &s;aid, Argue with them about coming in to the Go&s;pel Kingdom; apply to their Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience; inform their Under&s;tanding; convince their Judg|ment; make U&s;e of tho&s;e Per&s;ua&s;ions, lay before them tho&s;e Motives and Arguments, which will leave them inexcu&s;able, if they are not wro't upon; if they are not, in the <HI>moral</HI> Sen&s;e, <HI>compelled to come in.</HI></P>
<P>This is the plain Meaning of the Phra&s;e; nor is its Sen&s;e at all difficult or perplext: And yet, as if Men had a De&s;ign to mi&s;under&s;tand our Saviour, they have taken Occa&s;ion from this, and &s;uch like Texts, to in|troduce <HI>that Sort</HI> of Compul&s;ion into Religion, which can never be ju&s;tified, either by <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> or <HI>Revelation.</HI></P>
<P>This is particularly true of the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> who interpret my Text as a <HI>Divine Warrant</HI> to make U&s;e of <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Violence</HI> in the Affairs of <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> and <HI>Salvation.</HI> In&s;tead of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Argument</HI>; at lea&s;t, together with it, they &s;uppo&s;e our Saviour means <HI>Fire and Faggot</HI>: And if this is what he had in View, they have, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, mo&s;t punctually comply'd with his Command; as not having omitted any Kind of <HI>outward Violence,</HI> however barbarous and inhumane. But 'tis impo&s;&s;ible our Saviour &s;hould have had it in his Thoughts to recommend <HI>this Sort</HI> of Compul&s;ion: To be &s;ure, if we may judge, either from <HI>his Example,</HI> the <HI>Nature of his Go&s;pel,</HI> or indeed from the <HI>Rea&s;on of Things,</HI> this was one of the la&s;t Methods he would ever have recommended.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004349_0006_1004441DB3B46F58">As for the <HI>Example of Chri&s;t,</HI> this was ever again&s;t the <HI>U&s;e of Force</HI> in Matters of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Con&s;cience.</HI> He never compelled Men to embrace his Go&s;pel; never made U&s;e of the Art (which has &s;ince been found out&punc; and &s;o often put in Practice) of enlight|ning Men's Con&s;ciences, by <HI>fining their E&s;tates,</HI> or <HI>impri&s;oning their Per&s;ons,</HI> or <HI>abu&s;ing their Bodies</HI>; ty|ing them to the <HI>Whipping-Po&s;t, Gibbet</HI> or <HI>Gallows.</HI> He did not go about, in any of the&s;e Methods of Force, to propagate his Religion; but in the <HI>gentle Methods of Per&s;ua&s;ion.</HI> That was his Manner in making <HI>Pro|&s;elytes</HI> to his Religion, <HI>If any Man will, let him be my Di&s;ciple. If any Man will, let him follow me. Will ye al&s;o go away?</HI> He u&s;ed Violence with no Man; but applied to all, in a Way &s;uited to their <HI>Make as Men</HI>: Rea&s;oning the Ca&s;e with them, of|fering Light to their Under&s;tandings, and Conviction to their Con&s;ciences; but after all, leaving it to their own <HI>free Choice,</HI> whether they would reject or re|ceive Him and his Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>And 'tis remarkable, when his Di&s;ciples, in a Fit of <HI>religious Zeal,</HI> would have call'd for <HI>Fire from Hea|ven,</HI> to de&s;troy tho&s;e who would not receive him, he very &s;ea&s;onably gave a Check to it; informing them, how contrary <HI>&s;uch a Spirit and Conduct</HI> was, to the De&s;ign of his coming, which was <HI>to &s;ave, not to de|&s;troy Men's Lives.</HI> Says the <HI>Evangeli&s;t Luke,</HI> who gives the Account of this Matter, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> xix. 55, 56.</NOTE> <HI>He turned, and re|buked them, and &s;aid, Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of. For the Son of Man is not come to de&s;troy Men's Lives, but to &s;ave them.</HI> Our Lord, you &s;ee, with a greater Severity than ordinary, corrected
<PB N="5" REF="004349_0007_10044FC8D6329A18">
this <HI>burning Zeal</HI> of his Di&s;ciples; and this; though it was a <HI>religious Zeal</HI>; and the <HI>Object</HI> of it, tho&s;e who rejected and de&s;pi&s;ed, both Him and his Doctrine. And he ever di&s;countenanc'd <HI>religious Fu|ry and Rage,</HI> in all the Acts and In&s;tances of it: To be &s;ure, he did &s;o by his <HI>Example</HI>; for he ne|ver once, in his whole Life, did any Thing that lookt like <HI>per&s;ecuting</HI> Men for Religion. So far from it, that he was always calm and peaceable, and treated even his greate&s;t Oppo&s;ers with all Meekne&s;s and Mildne&s;s. His Concern was to &s;erve the Intere&s;t of Men's Souls; and if he could do this in the Methods proper to be u&s;ed with Men, i. e. by <HI>Per&s;ua&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Argument,</HI> he was not wanting in his Endeavours: but he would not make U&s;e of <HI>Force,</HI> nor in a <HI>com|pul&s;ive</HI> Way have any Thing to do with them.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t</HI> as little favours the U&s;e of <HI>Violence</HI> in Matters of <HI>Religion</HI> as his Example: Yea, the <HI>U&s;e of Force</HI> is ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Nature of that Kingdom,</HI> the Go&s;pel was intended to &s;et on Foot in the World. So &s;peaks our Saviour in tho&s;e expre&s;s Words, John xviii. 36. <HI>My Kingdom is not of this World.</HI> i. e. 'Tis not like <HI>earthly</HI> King|doms and Monarchies, which are e&s;tabli&s;h'd with a View to Men's <HI>worldly</HI> Happine&s;s, and are accordingly &s;upported and guarded with <HI>worldly</HI> Sanctions: But 'tis a Kingdom of a quite different Kind, a Kingdom that is <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> having to do with Men's <HI>Souls,</HI> not their <HI>Bodies</HI>; with their <HI>eternal,</HI> not their <HI>temporal</HI> Con|cerns: And being a Kingdom thus <HI>&s;piritual</HI> in its Nature and De&s;ign, its <HI>Sanctions</HI> are of the <HI>&s;ame Kind</HI>; its <HI>Weapons not carnal,</HI> but <HI>&s;piritual</HI>: It exerci&s;es no Dominion over Men's <HI>E&s;tates</HI> or <HI>Bodies</HI>; it makes no U&s;e of <HI>&s;ecular Force.</HI> For &s;o it follows in the next Words, <HI>If my Kingdom were of this World, then
<PB N="6" REF="004349_0008_10049D4E4B73CEF8">
would my Servants fight.</HI> i. e. they would, in a <HI>Way of Force,</HI> defend my Per&s;on and my Doctrine: But, as a &s;ure Evidence of the Truth of what I have &s;aid, that <HI>my Kingdom is not like the Kingdoms of this World,</HI> my Subjects and Servants make U&s;e of none of the Methods of <HI>Ho&s;tility</HI> and <HI>Violence</HI>: Or if they do, 'tis not with <HI>my Approbation,</HI> they act not by <HI>Com|mi&s;&s;ion</HI> from me. And indeed, &s;o far was our Savi|our from encouraging the Subjects of his Kingdom, to do any Thing in a Way of <HI>external Violence,</HI> tho' it were in <HI>Protection</HI> even of <HI>his very Per&s;on,</HI> that when one of them, upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, <HI>drew his Sword,</HI> he in&s;tantly gave forth his Command, <HI>Put up again thy Sword into his Place</HI>; and added upon it, in tho&s;e &s;olemn Words, <HI>All they that take the Sword, &s;hall peri&s;h with the Sword</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xxvi. 52.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nor is the <HI>U&s;e of Force</HI> in <HI>religious</HI> Matters le&s;s contrary to the <HI>Go&s;pel Precepts,</HI> than it is to the <HI>Na|ture of the Go&s;pel Kingdom</HI>: Nay, &s;uch a Method of dealing with Men is contrary to what runs thro' the whole Go&s;pel, as its peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing Spirit and Genius. That of <HI>loving one another,</HI> of loving even <HI>all Men, Enemies</HI> as well as <HI>Friends,</HI> tho&s;e who <HI>embrace Error</HI> as well as tho&s;e who <HI>believe the Truth</HI>; yea, <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Infidels,</HI> as well as <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> is the <HI>Commandment of the Go&s;pel,</HI> by Way of <HI>Emi|nence</HI> and <HI>Di&s;tinction.</HI> Says our Lord, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xv. 12.</NOTE> <HI>This is</HI> MY COMMANDMENT, <HI>that ye love one another.</HI> And again, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xiii. 34.</NOTE> <HI>A</HI> NEW COMMANDMENT <HI>I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye al&s;o love one another.</HI> And again, <NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>V</HI> 35.</NOTE> <HI>By this &s;hall all Men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye have Love one to another.</HI> Men of all Profe&s;&s;ions and Religions are

known by &s;ome <HI>peculiar Badge</HI> and <HI>Character,</HI> So the <HI>Jews</HI> were di&s;tingui&s;h'd by their Adherence to the <HI>Law of Mo&s;es</HI>; and the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> among the Jews, by their <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Separation</HI> from other Men: But our Saviour would have his Di&s;ciples known and di&s;tingui&s;h'd by their <HI>Benignity of Temper,</HI> their <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI>; expre&s;&s;ing it &s;elf in all the Acts of true Kindne&s;s and Beneficence. And he requires it of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> &s;o far to exceed all others in all the In|&s;tances of <HI>real Love</HI> and <HI>Benevolence,</HI> as that this may be a <HI>Characteri&s;tick,</HI> a <HI>Mark</HI> by which to di&s;tingui&s;h them from all other Men: So contrary is all <HI>Ha|tred</HI> and <HI>Strife,</HI> all <HI>uncharitable</HI> and <HI>ill treating</HI> one another, to the <HI>Precepts</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>It may perhaps be pretended, 'tis from <HI>true Charity</HI> to Men, a <HI>Love</HI> to their <HI>Souls,</HI> a <HI>real Concern</HI> for their <HI>eternal Intere&s;t,</HI> that the <HI>Methods of Violence</HI> are u&s;ed with them, that they are called to undergo Hard|&s;hips and Sufferings in their <HI>Bodies</HI> or <HI>E&s;tates.</HI> But the Go&s;pel knows of no &s;uch Methods of Love and Charity: Nor is it <HI>Love</HI> to Men's <HI>Souls</HI>; but the <HI>Love of this World,</HI> the <HI>Love of Power,</HI> the Love of <HI>Tyranny over Men's Con&s;ciences,</HI> that puts Men upon the <HI>Methods of Force,</HI> to bring others to be of the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion and Principles with them&s;elves.

if God peradventure will give them Repentance to the acknowledging of the Truth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii, 24, 25.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This is the Temper and Conduct, which the Go&s;|pel requires in Matters of Religion. Its Precepts are directly calculated to encourage and promote Peace and Good-will among Men: Nor can any Thing be more oppo&s;ite to the <HI>De&s;ign</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Religion, than for Men to bite and devour one another, injure and male-treat each other: Nor does it at all alter the Ca&s;e, tho' they &s;hould do this under the Pretext of <HI>Zeal for God,</HI> or the mo&s;t <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate Concern for the Salvation of Souls.</HI></P>
<P>We ought, 'tis true, to have near our Heart the <HI>Glory of God,</HI> and the <HI>&s;piritual and eternal Good</HI> of our friends and Neighbours; yea, of all Men: But we are much mi&s;taken, if we imagine, that we can either do <HI>Honour to God,</HI> or <HI>Service to the Souls of Men,</HI> in the Methods of <HI>Wrath</HI> and <HI>Anger</HI> and <HI>Cla|mour</HI>: No, our Concern for the <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Good of others ought principally to expre&s;s it &s;elf, in <HI>in&s;tructing tho&s;e who are out of the Way, and oppo&s;e the Truth,</HI> not, as <HI>Gideon</HI> did the Men of <HI>Succoth,</HI> with <HI>Briers and Thorns</HI>; but with <HI>Meekne&s;s of Wi&s;dom.</HI> For <HI>An|ger re&s;teth in the Bo&s;om of Fools,</HI> as the <HI>wi&s;e Man</HI> &s;peaks<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. <HI>vii. 9.</HI></NOTE>: And, as the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>The Wrath of Man worketh not the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">James <HI>i. 20.</HI></NOTE>. If we are fierce and furious, and of a Temper di&s;po&s;ing and engaging us, to <HI>convert Men's Souls</HI> by <HI>abu&s;ing their Bodies,</HI> we are in an <HI>exceeding bad</HI> Frame of Mind. For <HI>Zeal without Charity,</HI> a Zeal that would put us upon calling for <HI>Fire from Heaven,</HI> or the <HI>Sword from
<PB N="9" REF="004349_0011_10044FCEEC40DB80">
the Earth,</HI> to de&s;troy Men's <HI>Bodies,</HI> for the good of their <HI>Souls,</HI> is as oppo&s;ite to the Go&s;pel, as contradictory to its great and fundamental Precepts, as any Thing we would rectify, that we &s;uppo&s;e to be ami&s;s in others.</P>
<P>But the <HI>U&s;e of Force,</HI> in Matters of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> is not only contrary to the <HI>Example of Chri&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Precepts of his Go&s;pel</HI>; but to the <HI>Na|ture and Rea&s;on of Things.</HI> 'Tis in it &s;elf a Method altogether un&s;uted to Work upon the Minds of Men. For whatever Influence it may have upon their <HI>Bo|dies,</HI> it can have none on their <HI>Souls.</HI> It conveys no Light into the Mind; it brings no Conviction to the Judgment and Con&s;cience; it effects no Alteration in Men's Thoughts and Sentiments: But after all that can be done, in a <HI>Way of Compul&s;ion,</HI> Men's Minds will be the &s;ame; they will entertain the &s;ame Thot's; the &s;ame Notions and Principles; and will, in the <HI>moral</HI> Sen&s;e, remain ju&s;t the &s;ame Per&s;ons. Nor is there the lea&s;t Sutablene&s;s in <HI>external Force</HI> to move the <HI>Soul,</HI> in any of its rational Operations: Yea, it is as ab&s;urd and ridiculous to make U&s;e of <HI>Force</HI> to affect the <HI>Mind</HI> and <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> as it would be to make U&s;e of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Argument</HI> to affect the <HI>bodily Sen&s;es. Force</HI> is proper to the <HI>Body, Rea&s;on</HI> to the <HI>Mind:</HI> And 'tis plainly an inverting the Order of Nature, to make U&s;e of that with Reference to the <HI>Soul,</HI> which is adapted, in its U&s;e, only to the <HI>Body</HI>: Nor let Men u&s;e what <HI>Violence</HI> they plea&s;e, will it have the lea&s;t Influence upon Men, to make them <HI>truly religious.</HI> It may put them upon making an <HI>out&s;ide Appearance</HI> in Religion, i. e. It may make them <HI>Hy|pocrites,</HI> it may make them <HI>deal deceitfully</HI> both with <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> and often does &s;o; but it can never make them <HI>good Chri&s;tians.</HI> It may put them upon

<HI>profe&s;&s;ing with their Mouths,</HI> or <HI>wor&s;hipping with their Bodies,</HI> as tho&s;e, in who&s;e Power they are, would have them; but there is no Value, <HI>religiou&s;ly &s;peaking,</HI> in &s;uch <HI>Profe&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Wor&s;hip:</HI> Nor indeed is there the lea&s;t <HI>true Religion</HI> in any of tho&s;e Actions that are the Re&s;ult, not of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> but of <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Violence.</HI></P>
<P>Not but that Men may, con&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on, be <HI>re&s;trained</HI> from <HI>the&s;e</HI> or <HI>tho&s;e vicious Practices.</HI> The <HI>civil</HI> Good of Society may make <HI>&s;uch Re&s;traints</HI> ne|ce&s;&s;ary: And whenever it does &s;o, they are <HI>rea&s;onable</HI>; Men ought to be laid under them. Bat then it mu&s;t, at the &s;ame Time, be remembred, there is <HI>no Religi|on</HI> in their ab&s;taining from <HI>the&s;e</HI> or <HI>tho&s;e Vices,</HI> while their ab&s;taining from them is the Effect of <HI>external Force.</HI> As Men are <HI>rational, free Agents,</HI> they can't be <HI>religious</HI> but with the <HI>free Con&s;ent of their Wills</HI>; and this can be gain'd in no Way, but that of <HI>Rea|&s;on</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ua&s;ion. Compul&s;ion</HI> is of no Significancy here. It has no Influence to <HI>per&s;uade</HI> the <HI>Will</HI>; but rather the <HI>contrary</HI>: Nor was any Man ever <HI>forc'd</HI> to be <HI>religious.</HI></P>

Men ought not to come to the <HI>Ordinance of the Sup|per,</HI> if they have no other Rea&s;on for their coming, but that they may be <HI>qualified for &s;ome Place of Ho|nour or Profit.</HI> This would be a ba&s;e Motive indeed: And 'tis pity Men &s;hould ever be tempted with a Motive that is &s;o mean and low: Nor would it be to the Credit of any <HI>religious E&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> to make <HI>that</HI> which is a <HI>&s;olemn Te&s;t</HI> of Men's Subjection to <HI>Je|&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> a <HI>Qualification</HI> without which they can &s;u&s;tain <HI>no Office</HI> in the <HI>State,</HI> not &s;o much as that of a common <HI>Exci&s;e-Man.</HI> If any Thing can be, this certainly is, a wicked <HI>perverting the U&s;e</HI> of the <HI>mo&s;t &s;acred Rite</HI> of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion; turning it in|to an <HI>Engine of worldly Policy</HI>: At be&s;t, 'tis making U&s;e of a <HI>Motive,</HI> which tends to <HI>compel</HI> Men to re|gard <HI>this In&s;titution of Chri&s;tianity,</HI> more with a View to <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> than to <HI>God,</HI> or the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> Nor, where the Motive from <HI>this World</HI> is &s;o &s;trong, would it be any Thing &s;trange, if Men &s;hou'd fre|quently be wrought upon to go to the <HI>Sacrament,</HI> that they might make a <HI>Gain of Godline&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But 'tis Time that I proceed to the <HI>Work of com|pelling you</HI> to give your Attendance at the <HI>Lord's Supper.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let me <HI>compel you from the Authority of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> The <HI>Ordinance of the Supper</HI> is plainly an In|&s;titution
<PB N="22" REF="004349_0024_1004443BD8C90FF0">
of <HI>his. Do this in Remembrance of me,</HI> are the Words of <HI>Chri&s;t him&s;elf</HI>; and as expre&s;s a Com|mand from him, as any in the whole Go&s;pel And is he not our <HI>Law-giver,</HI> and <HI>King,</HI> and <HI>Judge,</HI> as well as <HI>Saviour?</HI> Has he not a rightful Authority to give out his Commands? And are we not bound to obey them? And if we are oblig'd to obey his Commands at all, why not in this In&s;tance as well as in any other? Has not this the &s;ame Stamp of his Authority on it? And if we may di&s;pen&s;e with his Authority in this Article, why not in any other? Why may we not neglect <HI>Prayer,</HI> and the <HI>publick Wor&s;hip,</HI> as well as the <HI>&s;acramental Supper?</HI> The Authority of Chri&s;t is ju&s;t the &s;ame in the&s;e &s;everal In&s;tances of Duty; and we may no more neglect to <HI>remember Chri&s;t at his Table,</HI> than to <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> him in <HI>his Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, there are &s;ome Circum&s;tances that do, in a peculiar Manner, recommend to our Ob&s;ervance the <HI>&s;acramental In&s;titution.</HI> 'Tis the In&s;titution of our <HI>dy|ing Saviour.</HI> To <HI>remember him,</HI> by <HI>eating Bread,</HI> and <HI>drinking Wine,</HI> in a <HI>religious</HI> Manner, was the Com|mand he gave us, ju&s;t as he was going to lay down his Life for us. Says the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Cor. xi. 23. <HI>The Lord Je&s;us, the &s;ame Night in which he was betrayed, took Bread; &mdash; and &s;aid, Take, eat; &mdash; this do in Remembrance of me.</HI> And &s;hall we not remember Chri&s;t, when he has de&s;ired we would; and expre&s;&s;ed this his De&s;ire, when he was about to do the greate&s;t Act of Kindne&s;s for us, even offer up him&s;elf a Sa|crifice to make Atonement for our Sins? O let us not put &s;o &s;mall a Value on the Love of our Re|deemer, as to neglect <HI>that In&s;titution</HI> he has &s;et up in his Church, on Purpo&s;e to perpetuate the Memory of it. Let us rather joyfully embrace every Oppor|tunity
<PB N="23" REF="004349_0025_10044FE657F5F110">
of remembring this Love of his, which was &s;tronger than Death. 'Tis infinitely rea&s;onable we &s;hould do &s;o: Nor otherwi&s;e &s;hall we be able to free our &s;elves from the Charge of the blacke&s;t Ingrati|tude, to our be&s;t Friend and greate&s;t Benefactor.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let me <HI>compel you</HI> by &s;hewing you, that you have no <HI>ju&s;t Ground of Excu&s;e,</HI> nothing <HI>&s;ufficient to plead,</HI> why you &s;hould not come to <HI>this Supper.</HI></P>
<P>Do any excu&s;e them&s;elves, became they have other Things to mind, which call off their Thoughts and Hearts from this Duty? This is the Excu&s;e in my Context. One had <HI>bought a Piece of Ground,</HI> and he <HI>mu&s;t needs go and &s;ee it.</HI> Another had <HI>bought five Yoke of Oxen,</HI> and he <HI>mu&s;t go and prove them.</HI> And a third had <HI>married a Wife,</HI> and &s;o <HI>could not come.</HI> And this is the Excu&s;e of Multitudes at pre&s;ent. They are &s;o <HI>encumbred with the World,</HI> that they han't Time to think of their Duty, or to engage in the Practice of it. But this is certainly an <HI>in&s;ufficient</HI> Excu&s;e. We ought not to regard this World, or &s;uffer any of the Affairs and Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of it, &s;o to engro&s;s our Hearts, as to take 'em off from minding the Con|cerns of our Souls, and an Attendance on our Duty; particularly, this of waiting upon Chri&s;t at his Table. And if this is all that we have to &s;ay, the <HI>Lord of the Fea&s;t</HI> will be <HI>angry</HI> with us: Nor can we ex|pect, but that he will <HI>bind us Hand and Foot, and ca&s;t us into outer Darkne&s;s: There will be weeping and wailing and gna&s;hing of Teeth.</HI></P>
<P>Do any excu&s;e them&s;elves for the <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> re&s;olving that they will attend this Duty <HI>&s;ometime hence?</HI> This, it may be fear'd, is the Ca&s;e of too many. They are for putting off the Duty, hoping they may, with <HI>more
<PB N="24" REF="004349_0026_10044FB8D5EDC118">
Convenience,</HI> engage in it <HI>hereafter.</HI> But this al&s;o is an <HI>in&s;ufficient</HI> Plea. The Command of Chri&s;t, <HI>This do in Remembrance of me,</HI> requires <HI>in&s;tant</HI> Obedience. 'Tis a <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Obligation that lies on us; and we may, by no Means, di&s;pen&s;e with it: 'Tis at our Peril, if we do. Be&s;ides, we have no Time in <HI>our own Power,</HI> but the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI>: And if we don't attend this Duty <HI>now,</HI> we may never have another Opportunity.</P>
<P>Do any excu&s;e them&s;elves, becau&s;e 'tis a <HI>&s;olemn</HI> Or|dinance? Some are too ready to make this Plea; putting too great Difference between <HI>this</HI> and the <HI>other</HI> Duties of Religion. <HI>This,</HI> 'tis true, is a <HI>&s;olemn</HI> Duty: But &s;o is the Duty of <HI>Prayer.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>&s;olemn</HI> Thing to addre&s;s the &s;upreme Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth. And perhaps the <HI>Prayers</HI> at the Sacrament, are the <HI>mo&s;t &s;olemn Part</HI> of the Duty. But let the <HI>Solemnity</HI> of the &s;acramental In&s;titution be what it will, this is no Rea&s;on why we &s;hould neglect it. The <HI>more &s;olemn</HI> the Ordinance, the <HI>greater</HI> is its <HI>Impor|tance</HI>; and the <HI>&s;tronger</HI> therefore the <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> why we &s;hould attend it.</P>
<P>Do any excu&s;e them&s;elves, becau&s;e they an't <HI>pre|par'd</HI> for &s;o <HI>holy an Ordinance?</HI> This is the mo&s;t common Plea; but a very in&s;ufficient one. If we an't prepar'd for the Sacrament, 'tis our <HI>Sin</HI>: And do we think, that <HI>that</HI> which is <HI>our Sin,</HI> will be a <HI>&s;ufficient Excu&s;e,</HI> for a plain Neglect in Point of Duty? It can never be. If we are really unfit for an Approach to the Table of the Lord; our Duty is plain: We &s;hould in&s;tantly &s;et about the Work of preparing our &s;elves herefor; and give no Sleep to our Eyes, nor Slumber to our Eye-lids, till we have accompli&s;ht it: And the rather, becau&s;e if we are unprepar'd, in our <HI>habitual Frame,</HI> for the
<PB N="25" REF="004349_0027_10044FE9D1C9AE30">
Sacrament, we are unprepar'd for Death and Judg|ment; we are unfit to go to Heaven. And this is certainly a State, we ought not to be quiet in.</P>
<P>Do any excu&s;e them&s;elves, imagining there is <HI>le&s;s Danger</HI> in a <HI>total Neglect</HI> of the Sacrament, than in coming to it, unle&s;s in the <HI>be&s;t prepared</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t worthy</HI> Manner? This &s;eems to be the Apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome. They would willingly come to the Sacra|ment; but are afraid, they &s;han't receive in &s;o worthy a Manner, as they would be glad, and &s;o think it <HI>&s;afe&s;t</HI> and <HI>be&s;t, totally</HI> to ab&s;tain. But this is intirely a wrong Way of thinking and arguing. For there is <HI>Danger</HI> in <HI>neglecting</HI> the Sacrament, as well as in <HI>coming to it in an unprepared Manner</HI>; and the Dan|ger of a <HI>total Neglect</HI> is certainly <HI>much greater,</HI> than a <HI>meer Defect</HI> in the <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI> of Preparation. 'Tis a Fault to come to the Sacrament, unle&s;s we are in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure prepared: 'Tis a Fault like|wi&s;e, and a greater Fault, <HI>totally</HI> to ab&s;tain. Our Wi&s;dom therefore in this Ca&s;e is, neither to ab&s;tain from the Sacrament, nor to come to it but in a well prepar'd Manner: And this is what we &s;hould take Pains about; nor &s;hould we allow our &s;elves to be ea&s;y, till we have effected it.</P>
<P>In fine, Do any excu&s;e them&s;elves, becau&s;e they imagine they &s;hall be under <HI>greater Ties of Duty,</HI> and <HI>more</HI> will be <HI>expected</HI> and <HI>required</HI> of them? Some are afraid of this. They imagine, if they come to the Sacrament, they mu&s;t lead more holy Lives; be more circum&s;pect, more careful of them&s;elves, and of their whole Walk. But neither is this an Objection of any Weight. 'Tis true indeed, the <HI>more</HI> Men <HI>profe&s;s,</HI> the <HI>more holy</HI> they ought to be; and the <HI>&s;tronger</HI> are their Bonds to be circum&s;pect of their
<PB N="26" REF="004349_0028_10044FECDD198DF0">
Ways. And is this what we are afraid of? We &s;hould be a&s;ham'd to make &s;uch an Excu&s;e. 'Tis certainly to our Di&s;honour; as arguing the Want of a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of that Holine&s;s, without which we can never &s;ee the Lord. We can't be <HI>too</HI> holy, nor <HI>too &s;trongly</HI> bound to endeavour to be &s;o, to the <HI>highe&s;t Degree.</HI></P>
<P>The Time will not permit me to mention any Thing further; nor have I, indeed, any more than hinted at the Things, which have been mention'd, O be per&s;uaded by the Arguments wherewith you have been compelled! And let it be your <HI>&s;peedy</HI> Care to come to the <HI>Sacrament.</HI> You are now &s;olemnly invited in the Name of Chri&s;t to give your Attendance at his Table. O excu&s;e not your &s;elves! Let it not be &s;aid, you were invited, but rejected the Invitation; lea&s;t the <HI>Lord</HI> &s;hould &s;wear concerning you, that you &s;hould not <HI>hereafter ta&s;te of his Supper, in his heavenly and eternal Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>And as for us, who have accepted the Invitation of Chri&s;t, and are about to <HI>eat Bread</HI> and <HI>drink Wine,</HI> according to his Appointment, let us take Heed to our &s;elves, that we do it in a <HI>religious</HI> Manner. Let us put a Difference between <HI>this</HI> and <HI>common</HI> Bread and Wine. Let us eat of <HI>this Bread</HI> and drink of <HI>this Cup</HI>; employing our Tho'ts on Chri&s;t, and re|membring his Love in giving him&s;elf to die for us.</P>
<P>And may the <HI>Love of Chri&s;t con&s;train us</HI> to live unto him! Since <HI>he died for all, that they which live, &s;hould not henceforth live unto them&s;elves, but un|to him who died for them, and ro&s;e again.</HI></P>
