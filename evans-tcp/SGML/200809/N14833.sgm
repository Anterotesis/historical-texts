<HEAD>AN INQUIRY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>FREQUENTLY ob&s;erving the doctrine of repentance treated of in &s;uch a manner as is difficult to under&s;tand, in con&s;i&s;tency with the go&s;pel of divine grace; it has often exerci&s;ed my mind to enquire from the &s;criptures, after a &s;atisfactory view of it; and finding that after our Lord's re|&s;urrection, when that event took place which explained the &s;criptures, he opened the under&s;tanding of the di&s;ciples that they might under&s;tand them, and &s;aid unto them,&mdash;<HI>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chri&s;t to &s;uffer and to ri&s;e again the third day;</HI> as in Luke xxiv. 40.46. It is added in Ver&s;e 47, <HI>and that repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name among all nations be|ginning at Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>In inquiring into the nature or meaning of repentance, it may a&s;&s;i&s;t me to view every part of this pa&s;&s;age. As,</P>
<P>What may I under&s;tand by repentance: What by re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins: What by its being preached in his name: How it concerns all nations; and, Why it was to begin at Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P N="1">I. What may be under&s;tood by repentance.</P>
<P>Repentance is here brought in as that which the death and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t prepared a way for the proclamation of:&mdash;He &s;aid, <HI>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chri&s;t to &s;uffer and to ri&s;e from the dead the third day</HI>; and that repentance &amp;c. here is a connexion between the
<PB N="4" REF="018809_0003_0FA8234B96827F38">
&s;ufferings and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, and the proclamation of repentance, as an act of grace founded thereupon, and i&s;&s;ued for the encouragement of the rebel to return; who other ways could look for nothing but de&s;truction. In this view it is the gracious call of the offended Sovereign to his revolted creatures, to return to him as their rightful owner and Lord.&mdash;I&s;aiah xxxi. 6. <HI>Turn ye unto him, from whom the children of I&s;rael have deeply revolted.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. What may be under&s;tood by remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</P>
<P>Sins or tre&s;pa&s;&s;es are called debts, <HI>Mat.</HI> vi. 12.15. When a per&s;on is in debt, it is plain that law and ju&s;tice demand remittance until full payment is made; the pay|ment of the debt is its remi&s;&s;ion, and this remi&s;&s;ion &s;atisfies the demands of law and ju&s;tice, which were again&s;t the debtor: Here then remi&s;&s;ion is full &s;atisfaction to that law, of which &s;in is a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and to that ju&s;tice which demands penalty of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or; for unle&s;s law and ju&s;tice be compleatly &s;atisfied, there is no remi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">III. What by its being preached in his name.</P>
<P>Why, &s;urely there is no other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved, either from the delu&s;ion, ignorance and darkne&s;s, whereby we have for&s;aken the right way, or whereby we may be returned to our rightful owner, or whereby law and ju&s;tice are &s;atisfied. So then he him&s;elf is eminently the way in all the&s;e re&s;pects. <HI>Gallations</HI> iv. 4, 5. <HI>God &s;ent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law</HI>: The law had a demand of perfect obe|dience upon them that were under it, which to them was impo&s;&s;ible in their own per&s;ons; he as their head, and in their &s;tead, is brought in; in the volume of the book, &s;ay|ing, <HI>Lo! I come to do thy will</HI>: So that whatever the law required, was perfectly obeyed by him who did always the thing that plea&s;ed the father, who delighted to do his will, and could not be convinced of &s;in, but could &s;ay, <HI>I was upright before him, I have glorified thee on earth, and fini&s;hed the work thou gave&s;t me to do</HI>; &s;o that he perfectly obeyed the law.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="018809_0004_0FA8234E5B9AF0B8">They that were under the law were under the cur&s;e, he as the Redeemer of them that were under the law, was made a cur&s;e for us, &s;o &s;atisfied the penalty of the law, which is manife&s;t in his re&s;urrection from the dead; for when law and ju&s;tice took hold of him as head of the human nature, (as if he were the only tran&s;gre&s;&s;or) all being con&s;idered in him; he became our &s;urety, and the Lord laid the iniquities of us all upon him. Now unle&s;s law and ju&s;tice have full &s;atisfaction, the &s;urety is not di&s;charg|ed; but law and ju&s;tice being fully &s;atisfied, he <HI>having made peace by the blood of his cro&s;s; it was not po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be holden of death.&mdash;Death hath no more domi|nion over him.</HI>&mdash;Therefore the &s;urety is legally di&s;charged.</P>
<P>Thus his re&s;urrection from the dead evidences his ac|compli&s;hment of what he was made under the law for, <HI>i. e.</HI> To redeem them that were under the law; &s;o then the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t proves him <HI>our Redeemer.</HI>&mdash; Who&s;e Redeemer?&mdash;Them that were under the law. Then we belong to him by right of redemption, and ought to re|turn to him as our rightful owner, repenting of our e&s;trange|ment and alienation from him: But is there any encou|ragement hereunto: May we be received into favour? Yes!&mdash;Repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins. Repentance with remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins is preached in his name, and becau&s;e there is full remi&s;&s;ion, there is the fulle&s;t en|couragement to repentance. There is no other name that repentance will do to be preached in; call a man to re|pentance in the name of law and ju&s;tice: Repent for the cur&s;es of the law, the wrath of God, the demands of ju&s;tice are again&s;t you, and will &s;urely and &s;uddenly overtake you, except you repent; and it may drive him to endeavour to hide him&s;elf as Adam among the trees of the garden, and when he finds he cannot, it may drive him to de&s;pair; for repentance cannot &s;atisfy law or ju&s;tice, or appea&s;e the divine anger: Neither is it in them to produce repentance, they may &s;tir up enmity, and drive to de&s;pair, while the go&s;pel is out of &s;ight.&mdash;It is the prerogative of our Redeemer that has fully remitted our &s;ins.&mdash; <HI>He is exalted to give re|pentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="018809_0005_0FA8234E89781280">Among all nations this is to be preached, Jews and Gen|tiles, <HI>for God hath &s;hewed me</HI> (&s;aith Peter) <HI>that I &s;hould call no man common or unclean; what God hath &s;anctified, that call thou not common.</HI> There is neither Jew nor Greek, Barbarian, Cythian, bond or free, male or female that is excluded. Repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins is to be preached among all nations: If there were not full re|mi&s;&s;ion, how could it be preached, or how could they be called to repentance? But there is. He that is truth has ordered it to be preached as a truth among all nations; but as he was rejected at Jeru&s;alem, are not they excluded? <HI>No, Verily: It is to be preached among all nations,</HI> BEGIN|NING AT JERUSALEM. What though they like fi&s;hes, do all they can to e&s;cape the go&s;pel net, will not he that made his Apo&s;tles fi&s;hers of men, &s;o direct that net, as finally to take them in, with the fullne&s;s of the Gentiles, &s;o that all I&s;rael may be &s;aved, as it written: It is written, therefore it &s;hall be accompli&s;hed: Compare <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 25, to 32, with the parallel pa&s;&s;ages in the prophet.</P>
<P>But we may enquire if this view of repentance be agree|able to the &s;criptures of the old and new te&s;tament.&mdash;</P>
<P>We find when <HI>Solomon,</HI> in 1&s;t of <HI>Kings,</HI> viii. 47, praying for the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> carried captive for their &s;ins, &s;ays, if they &s;hall bethink them&s;elves, and repent, and make &s;up|plication, and return with all their heart, &amp;c. then hear their prayer, &amp;c. Ver&s;e 51 &s;hews the ground of this prayer, <HI>for they are thy people, and thine inheritance.</HI>&mdash;The idea of their being his people, and his inheritance, appears nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;hew the aggravations of their folly in &s;inning again&s;t him and the nece&s;&s;ity of repenting and returning to their rightful owner.&mdash;<HI>They are thine inheritance which thou had redeemed,</HI> P&s;alm lxxiv 2. And when they are called to repentence in the prophet <HI>Joel,</HI> chap. ii. 13&punc; it is <HI>turn to the Lord</HI> YOUR GOD. In <HI>Jeremiah</HI> xxvi. 13. (though a time of the greate&s;t degeneracy) they are thus called upon <HI>now amend your ways and doings, and obey the voice of the Lord</HI> YOUR GOD: And in <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> lv. 7, <HI>Let the wicked for&s;ake his way&punc; and the unrighteous his own imaginations, and re|turn
<PB N="7" REF="018809_0006_0FA8234FB4BDFFB8">
unto the Lord, and he will have mercy, and to</HI> OUR GOD <HI>he will abundantly pardon:</HI> And in <HI>Ho&s;ea</HI> xiv. 1, <HI>O I&s;rael, return to the Lord</HI> THY GOD. When God by the prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> in his 3d chapter, calls <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI> to repentance, ver&s;e 1, 7, 12, <HI>Return again to me, &s;aith the Lord. Turn thou unto me&punc; Return thou back&s;liding I&s;rael &s;aith the Lord.</HI> In ver&s;es 14 and 22, their obligation thereto, and the ground of their encouragement is mentioned:&mdash;Ver&s;e 14, <HI>Return for I am married unto</HI> YOU:&mdash;Ver&s;e 22, <HI>Re|turn ye back&s;liding children, I will heal your back&s;lidings,</HI> not <HI>and</HI> I will, as a condition (the <HI>and</HI> is there &s;upplied by the tran&s;lators) but I will heal your back&s;lidings.&mdash;On this encouragement, which is the only all-&s;ufficient one, they are brought in &s;aying <HI>behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord</HI> OUR GOD. And in <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xliv, 22, it is fully expre&s;&s;ed in a &s;imilar manner to the pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Luke</HI> xxiv. now before us.</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>LUKE xxiv, 47,</HI></BIBL>
<P>And that re|pentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name.</P>
<BIBL><HI>ISAIAH xliv. 22,</HI></BIBL>
<P>I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and as a cloud thy &s;ins: Return for I have redeemed thee.</P></Q>
<P>But if it be &s;aid the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of the Old Te&s;tament re|&s;pect antient I&s;rael, as God's peculiar people, not &s;inners of the Gentiles,&mdash;in an&s;wer it may be &s;aid, it has been &s;hewn it was to be preached as a truth among all nations; and the Apo&s;tle's que&s;tion is ready, Is he a God of the Jews only? Is he not of the Gentiles al&s;o? Yes, of the Gentiles al&s;o:&mdash; Are they ble&s;&s;ed in <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;o are all the nations of the earth&mdash;<HI>in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed</HI>:&mdash;Are they his inheritance,&mdash;his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;o are the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth. It was the di&s;po&s;ition that would confine the divine favour to the Jews, and to the mo&s;t e&s;teemed among them, that the preaching of <HI>John</HI> and of <HI>Je&s;us&punc;</HI> under the law di&s;pen&s;ation, called them to repentance from, or called them to repent of, <HI>Matthew</HI> iii. 2.&mdash; <HI>Repent for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand</HI>: He preached thus in the wilderne&s;s of Judea, among tho&s;e that
<PB N="8" REF="018809_0007_0FA823501BE05A40">
&s;uppo&s;ed the Me&s;&s;iah would rai&s;e their nation to great world|ly glory, and &s;et them above other nations, and that the mo&s;t e&s;teemed among them &s;hould be mo&s;t promoted there|in: He calls them to repent of their worldly notions of Chri&s;t's kingdom: It was a kingdom of Heaven that was at hand, where every one was admitted and promoted ac|cording to the good plea&s;ure of the King in virtue of his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, not according to their own &s;uppo&s;ed per|&s;onal characters: So tho&s;e that were exalted in their own and others apprehen&s;ions as mountains and hills, were brought low; and tho&s;e depre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of their own vilene&s;s and unworthine&s;s, and who were ju&s;tly e&s;teemed &s;o by o|thers, low as vallies, without any encouragement in them|&s;elves, are exalted, agreeable to <HI>I&s;aiah</HI>'s prophe&s;y, chap. xl. 4, <HI>Every valley &s;hall be exalted, and every mountain and hill &s;hall be brought low, the crooked &s;hall be made &s;trait, and the rough places plain; and the glory of the Lord &s;hall be revealed, and all fle&s;h &s;hall &s;ee together, for the mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken.</HI></P>
<P>Here we have a view of a perfect plain, where one &s;hould not ob&s;truct or overtop another, in viewing the object to be revealed.&mdash;<HI>The glory of the Lord:</HI> And as they all expect|ed benefit in that kingdom from their own characters; &s;ome expected to be foremo&s;t on account of their own &s;uppo&s;ed good characters, and others depre&s;&s;ed and de&s;pairing for want of &s;uch worthine&s;s, they are called to repent of their error and mi&s;take,&mdash;it was a kingdom of Heaven that was at hand, where none were admitted or excluded on account of their own per&s;onal character, but every one admitted on account of the perfect character of the Me&s;&s;iah.&mdash;<HI>The glory of the Lord &s;hall be revealed</HI>&mdash;the glory of divine wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, grace and mercy&mdash;the glory of all the divine attributes and perfections, harmonizing in the method of &s;alvation, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, according to <HI>P&s;alm</HI> lxxxv. 10, 11, <HI>Mercy and truth are met together, righteou&s;|ne&s;s and peace have ki&s;&s;ed: Truth &s;hall &s;pring out of the earth, and righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall look down from Heaven.</HI> Thus the glory of the Lord is revealed in him who is the bright|ne&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="018809_0008_0FA82350D26A2068">
of his glory, the light of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord is in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in whom dwells the fullne&s;s of the God-head: In him, the glory of the Lord is revealed, and in his time and way all fle&s;h &s;hall &s;ee to|gether, for the mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken.</P>
<P>If what has been &s;aid of <HI>John's</HI> preaching <HI>"for the king|dom of Heaven is at hand,'</HI> be agreeable to the &s;crip|tures, then we are to under&s;tand the preaching of Je&s;us in <HI>Mathew</HI> iv. 17. <HI>"Repent for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand."</HI> And <HI>Mark</HI> i. 15, <HI>"The time is fulfilled: The kingdom of Heaven is at hand: Repent ye and believe the go&s;pel, (The glad tidings, the good news of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t"</HI>) and the preaching of the twelve that Je&s;us &s;ent out two by two, <HI>Mark</HI> vi. 12, who <HI>went out and preached that men &s;hould repent,</HI>&mdash;in the &s;ame view.</P>
<P>When Je&s;us aro&s;e from the dead, evidencing the per|fection of his character, obedience and &s;acrifice; evidencing that ju&s;tice was fully &s;atisfied; then repentance and re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins are preached in his name: There can be no encouragement to repentance without remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, if there be not full remi&s;&s;ion in the perfect work of Chri&s;t, all is terror, de&s;pair, alienation and enmity. <HI>I &s;aid there is no hope, no, for I have loved &s;trangers, and after them, will go, Jeremiah</HI> ii. 25. Let this truth, the doctrine of remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, be clear, and there are the highe&s;t motives, encou|ragmets and obligations to repentance; there is room for it to be preached in the name of Je&s;us among all nations, even beginning at Jeru&s;alem: If we need any further, &s;ee <HI>Acts</HI> xvii. 20. <HI>Though the times of ignorance God winked at, but now he hath commanded all men every where to repent.</HI> Now &s;ince his re&s;urrection hath he commanded. Con&s;ider the dignity of the commander, and the authority of his com|mands, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> xxxiii. 9. <HI>He &s;pake and it was: He command|ed and it &s;tood.</HI> The Apo&s;tle pur&s;ues the thought from his re&s;urrection to his exaltation, as we read, <HI>Acts</HI> v. 30, 31. <HI>The God of our fathers rai&s;ed up Je&s;us whom ye &s;lew and hang|ed on a tree, him hath God exalted with his right hand, a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to I&s;rael and

forgivene&s;s of &s;ins:</HI> And in <HI>Acts</HI> xi. 18. we have a &s;peci|men actually taking place: <HI>Then hath God al&s;o to the Gen|tiles granted repentance unto life.</HI> How is this evidenced? Why&punc; they received or believed the Apo&s;tles te&s;timony con|cerning the way of acceptance with God in every nation. It was according to <HI>the word which God &s;ent to the children of I&s;rael, preaching peace by Je&s;us Chri&s;t who is Lord of all,</HI> his being anointed with the Holy Gho&s;t&punc; going about doing good, his death and re&s;urrection, and the evidences of it, together with the te&s;timony of the Prophets concerning him, as we &s;ee in <HI>Acts</HI> x. 34 to 44. This preaching being accompanied with the Holy Gho&s;t, gained full credit on the minds of the Gentiles, which when the church heard, they held their peace, and glorified God, &s;aying, then hath God al&s;o to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life: So that as &s;oon as they believed the report of the Go&s;pel concerning the life, death and re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &mdash;by the fir&s;t of which the precepts of the law are perfectly oboyed; by the next the penalty of it is &s;uffered, or the debt to it remitted; and by the third, viz his re&s;urrection we have the full evidence thereof. As &s;oon as this is believed&punc; it is &s;aid, then hath God al&s;o granted repentance unto life, the immediate in&s;eparable effect of believing the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins in his name</P>
<P>This is illu&s;trated in the <HI>The&s;&s;elonians,</HI> when they believed the Apo&s;tles te&s;timony, in the 17th of <HI>Acts,</HI> he &s;ays, con|cerning them in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle, Chap. 1.9. <HI>What man|ner of entrance we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols, to &s;erve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from Heaven, whom he had rai&s;ed from the dead.</HI> To turn to God from idols is repentance. This was in con&s;equence of the entrance of the Apo&s;tles among them, or of the <HI>The&s;elonians</HI> believing their report. What was their report among them? See <HI>Acts</HI> xvii. 2.3. <HI>Rea&s;on|ing with them out of the Scriptures, opening and alledging that Chri&s;t mu&s;t needs have &s;uffered and ri&s;en again from the dead, and that Je&s;us whom I preach unto you, is Chri&s;t,</HI> ver&s;e 4. <HI>Some of them believed.</HI> Tho&s;e believers compo&s;ed

the church of the <HI>The&s;&s;elonians,</HI> of whom it is &s;hewn, how they turned to God from idols.</P>
<P>So in the 20th of <HI>Acts</HI> 21, the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of keep|ing back nothing that was profitable, but, <HI>te&s;tifing both to the Jews, and al&s;o to the Greeks repentance towards God, and (or</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am informed the &s;ame Greek word which is tran&s;lated <HI>and</HI> is al&s;o tran&s;lated <HI>even,</HI> as in the judgment of the tran&s;lators was mo&s;t &s;uita|ble to the pa&s;&s;age.</NOTE><HI>even) faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> His preaching the faith as has been above &s;hewn&punc; was virtually preaching repentance, as it immediately called and led therto.

<P>How can repentance be preached otherwi&s;e.

preaching of the death and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, in which there is remi&s;&s;ion, and the evidence of it. But if it be &s;till urged as a condition, it can be no other ways, than as it can|not otherwi&s;e take place in our minds, for though there is remi&s;&s;ion in the one &s;acrifice,&mdash;and &s;o no more offering for &s;in as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;ed it, <HI>Hebrews</HI> x. 18, yet it connot take place in the minds of any while they remain in unbelief and impenitence: Yet their unbelief cannot make the truth of God of none effect.

<HEAD>I. TO THE AUTHOR OF THE PAMPHLET.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS your pamphlet was probably the occa&s;ion of the fore|going reflections. I have taken the freedom to addre&s;s you on the &s;ubject. When I read your work, if I recollect the idea the doctrine there advanced gave me, it was this, That Chri&s;t died for all, to bring them into a &s;alvable &s;tate, yet all would not be &s;aved, though they might, if they repented, con&s;equently God's glory would finally illu&s;triou&s;ly appear in the everla&s;ting condemnation of the finally impenitent.</P>
<P>And as the ear trieth words, as the mouth ta&s;teth meats, I found it did not &s;ound like the report of the go&s;pel, and on enquiring into the doctrine of repentance, I have collect|ed the thoughts which are pre&s;ented to you, I hope in love and faithfulne&s;s. The idea I received from the &s;crip|tures of the old te&s;tament is, that he &s;hould fini&s;h the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion&mdash;make an end of &s;in&mdash;make reconciliation for ini|quity&mdash;and bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s. The new te&s;tament witne&s;&s;es that he did.&mdash;The te&s;tator appeals to the father&mdash;<HI>I have glorified thee on earth: I have fini&s;hed the work thou gave&s;t me to do,</HI> and cries out on the cro&s;s, <HI>It is fini&s;hed,</HI> and &s;eals it with his blood, and witne&s;&s;es it in his re|&s;urrection, when he &s;hews him&s;elf alive to his cho&s;en wit|ne&s;&s;es, who te&s;tified to the &s;ame truth.&mdash;One pa&s;&s;age may &s;uffice: In <HI>Hebrews</HI> x, 11th the apo&s;tle &s;peaking of the prie&s;thood under the law, &s;ays, and every prie&s;t &s;tandeth daily mini&s;tering, and offering oftentimes the &s;ame &s;acrifices, which can never take away &s;in, but this man after he had offered one &s;acrifice for &s;ins, forever &s;at down on the right hand of God. They &s;tood as tho&s;e that had not done&mdash;could not accompli&s;h: But the High Prie&s;t Je&s;us after he had offered one &s;acrifice <HI>&s;at down</HI> as having fini&s;hed his work, <HI>fini&s;hed tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion&mdash;made an end of &s;in&mdash;made reconciliation for iniquity&mdash;and brought in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Ver&s;e 18th &s;ays, <HI>Where remi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e is, there is no more &s;a|crifice for &s;in.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the &s;cripture leads to full remi&s;&s;ion, when he had by him&s;elf purged our &s;ins, to a fini&s;hed work.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="018809_0014_0FA823555B895100">But your doctrine appears to me to lead to an unfini&s;hed work, dependent on the exerci&s;es, the exertions, in &s;hort, the will of the creature, and becau&s;e they will not come, that they might have life, he mu&s;t glorify him&s;elf in the de&s;truction of multitudes for whom he died.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k you, Sir, How? Is his mercy glorified?&mdash;Is his ju&s;tice &s;atisfied? Is his power made manife&s;t? Is he mighty to &s;ave? He will have all men to be &s;aved, not he <HI>would,</HI> but he will. Who hath re&s;i&s;ted his will?

Said the latter to the former, I'm very much a&s;toni&s;hed at you, that you do not embrace that doctrine&mdash;For if I believed as you, I &s;hould, for nothing is more clear from &s;cripture, than that Chri&s;t died for all:&mdash;The for|mer an&s;wered, I as much wonder at you, that you do not embrace it. I am &s;ure I &s;hould, if I believed as you, for if he died for all there is no power on earth or hell can hinder their &s;alvation&punc;&mdash;He cannot be di&s;appointed.</NOTE> Cannot he make them willing in the day of his power? His people &s;hall be&mdash; And are not all his peo|ple for whom he died? But I forbear; wi&s;hing to &s;ay no more than is &s;ufficient to di&s;charge my con&s;cience in love and faithfulne&s;s to you. But I cannot pa&s;s over your e&s;&s;ay without taking notice of the title, to compare it with the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>Scripture text,
<Q><BIBL>Romans <HI>iv, 5.</HI></BIBL>
<P>He that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly. <HI>Rom. v 6,</HI> Chri&s;t died for the ungodly.</P></Q></P>
<P>Your Title.</P>
<Q>Divine Glory brought to view, in the condemnati|on of the ungodly.</Q>
<P>On enquiry, How can this be in con&s;i&s;tence with tho&s;e &s;criptures? I an&s;wer, it can be no other ways in a con&s;i&s;tence with them, than in the fulfilment of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI>'s prophecy, chap. liii. 4, 5.6, <HI>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and car|ried our &s;orrows: Yet we did e&s;teem him &s;tricken, &s;mitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, brui&s;ed for our iniquities: The cha&s;ti&s;e|ment of our peace was upon him, and with his &s;tripes we
<PB N="16" REF="018809_0015_0FA8235827848FD8">
are healed. All we like &s;heep have gone a&s;tray; we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all</HI>:&mdash;So dying for the ungodly, he ju&s;tifies the ungodly, and the divine glory is brought to view illu&s;triou&s;ly to eternity herein. For mercy is glorified&mdash; ju&s;tice is &s;atisfied&mdash;and he &s;peaks in righteou&s;ne&s;s, when he manife&s;ts him&s;elf mighty to &s;ave.</P>
<P>But view the title page as it appears intended, what con|&s;olation is their for a poor, de&s;titute, ungodly creature? Sup|po&s;e him on a death bed, agonizing with angui&s;h of &s;oul, nothing &s;hort of per&s;ua&s;ion that there was an all-&s;ufficient remedy for his deplorable condition, could afford him the lea&s;t comfort or relief. Were you con&s;trained in this &s;ad hour to admini&s;ter them from tho&s;e texts, in the belief of your title, would he not &s;ay, I am mocked? But perhaps you might not offer them on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. Why? Are they not &s;cripture truths? Did not Chri&s;t die for the un|godly, and in proof, his dying for our &s;ins was accepted; he ro&s;e again for our ju&s;tification, and is not the knowledge of this truth all-&s;ufficient to quiet the mo&s;t guilty con&s;cience, and give hope towards God? Would it be &s;afe to tell him the law of God &s;tands in full force again&s;t him, when Je&s;us came to redeem them that were under the law? Would it not amount to denying that Je&s;us is come in the fle&s;h? Would it be &s;afe to tell &s;uch a man to exert him&s;elf in any way, however de&s;cribed, as if this was the la&s;t opportunity, and his all depended on it? It would indeed be to mock him! when his all depends on what Je&s;us Chri&s;t fini&s;hed, and the relief of his mind on the knowledge of it.</P>
<P>Suffer me a little further, if in looking over this dreadful title, I expre&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e that to it &s;hould be added in the title page, <HI>Search the &s;criptures</HI>; when you attempt to il|lu&s;trate it by rea&s;oning, without producing one text to &s;hew that the Ever-ble&s;&s;ed &s;peaks of condemnation as his glory. When the &s;criptures &s;peak of the divine glory as manife&s;t in his grace, mercy and forgivene&s;s&mdash;when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;aid in <HI>Exodus</HI> xxxiii. 18, <HI>I be&s;eech thee &s;hew me thy glory,</HI> the an|&s;wer is, <HI>I will make all my goodne&s;s pa&s;s before thee, and
<PB N="17" REF="018809_0016_0FA8235855BEDD30">
will be gacious to whom I will be gracious, and will &s;hew mercy on whom I will &s;hew mercy</HI>: Here goodne&s;s, grace and mercy is his glory. In <HI>Proverbs</HI> xix. 11, we read, <HI>the di&s;cretion of a man deferreth his anger, and</HI> HIS GLORY <HI>to pa&s;s over a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI>&mdash;If we under&s;tand the proverb, and it, interpretation, it doubtle&s;s refers to the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in whom we have the light of the know|ledge of the glory of God.</P>
<P>In <HI>P&s;alm</HI> cii. 16, it is &s;aid, <HI>When the Lord &s;hall build up Zion, he &s;hall appear in</HI> HIS GLORY.&mdash;How is this made manife&s;t?&mdash;In regarding the prayer of the de&s;titute; in hearing the groaning of the pri&s;oner,&mdash;and &s;aving the &s;ons of death, <HI>To declare his name in Zion, and his prai&s;e in Je|ru&s;alem</HI>:&mdash;That is his name, <HI>Forgiving iniquity, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;ins,</HI> through the &s;urety whom he would <HI>by no means clear,</HI> for <HI>the Lord laid on him the iniquities of us all, and &s;pared not his own &s;on, but delivered him up for us all, in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgive|ne&s;s of &s;in, according to the riches of his grace</HI>: Riches of his grace; is not this his glory? Yes, verily; the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindne&s;s towards us through Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>The angel of the Lord came upon the &s;hepherds, in <HI>Luke</HI> ii. 9, <HI>And the glory of the Lord &s;hone round about them:</HI> How is this made manife&s;t? <HI>Behold,</HI> &s;ays the angel, <HI>I bring you good tidings of great joy which &s;hall be to all peo|ple, for unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Sa|viour, which is Chri&s;t the Lord: Glory to God in the high|e&s;t, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</HI></P>
<P>I have briefly pre&s;ented the&s;e few pa&s;&s;ages, wi&s;hing you to turn to the &s;criptures, to view the divine glory, and if the&s;e texts, with what has been brought to view (in page 8,) of the glory of the Lord being revealed, was rightly under|&s;tood by tho&s;e that &s;earch the &s;criptures, I doubt not it would lead into the under&s;tanding of many pa&s;&s;ages in the old te&s;tament, where the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud,&mdash;filled the tabernacle, filled the hou&s;e, and the appearance of the likene&s;s of the glory of the Lord, &s;poken of by Ezekiel, and many other pa&s;&s;ages, that &s;peak of the
<PB N="18" REF="018809_0017_0FA82359923AD308">
Divine Glory, as they centre in Je&s;us the antitype, the bright|ne&s;s of glory; in whom the riches of his glory is made ma|nife&s;t, who came not to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them; not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be &s;aved. Indeed, Sir, if you think a few minutes, you cannot depi&s;e an invitation to this contemplation, for it is the final happine&s;s of tho&s;e given to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to be with him&mdash;to behold his glory.</P>
<P>I would ju&s;t take notice of what you &s;ay in page 50. <HI>"I con|ceive therefore that every honch man that di&s;believes the &s;enti|ment, will be free to declare it, and this plainly. I take liberty to add, that &s;uch a declaration will come with peculiar propriety and weight from the pulpit Watchman, what of the night, it is the language of the Almighty to go&s;pel mini&s;ters."</HI></P>
<P><HI>"With particular weight from the pulpit."</HI> I conceive the weight of any doctrine con&s;i&s;ts in the evidence of its truth and divinity, not in the place where, or from whence it is delivered.

<P>And ble&s;&s;ed be God he ta&s;ted death for every man. For if there be any for whom he did not die, it would be mocking them to preach the go&s;pel to them, to tell them that the law is an&s;wered, that ju&s;tice is &s;atisfied, and mercy flows freely in a full con&s;i&s;tency therewith, that the only living and true God is the ju&s;t God, and the &s;aviour, and there is none el&s;e, to tell them of remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, or call them to repentence, for certainly there could be no hope, if their &s;ins were not remitted they never can be, for Chri&s;t dieth no more, there is no more &s;acrifice for &s;in; but &s;eeing the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, which is by faith, is unto all, as well as upon all that be|lieve all may be called to repentance.

<P>Fourthly, <HI>He is exalted, a prince and a &s;aviour, to give repentance to I&s;rael, and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> Prophe&s;ied of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xxx. 18, <HI>Therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy.</HI> But it was to give repentence <HI>to I&s;rael.</HI> It was not then fully manife&s;ted that they were to go to the Gen|tiles: But from the time of <HI>Peter</HI>&punc;s vi&s;ion, he was taught to call no man common, or unclean; and the Gentiles appeared to be fellow heirs, and of the &s;ame body; and that they were to preach among them the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> The long &s;uffering patience of God is extended for this end 2. of <HI>Peter,</HI> iii. 9, the Lord is long &s;uffering to us ward, not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h&punc; but that all &s;hould come to repentence, agreeable to <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xxx. 18. and therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious. Now put the&s;e things together, and &s;hall the &s;tout-heartedne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy of the unbelieving impenitent and prophane children of men, di&s;appoint him. What will they do? He is wi&s;e in heart and mighty in &s;trength: None ever hardened him&s;elf again&s;t him and pro&s;pered; there is no wi&s;dom, nor under&s;tanding, nor coun&s;el again&s;t the Lord, who would &s;et the briars and thorns again&s;t him in battle, he would go through them, and burn them together.</P>
<P>Perhaps they would fain flee out of his hand; but where will they flee from his pre&s;ence? What the Lord &s;aith by the prophet <HI>Amos,</HI> may be here brought to view, <HI>Amos</HI> ix. 2. <HI>He that fleeth of them hall not flee away, and he that e&s;|capeth of them &s;hall not be delivered; though they dig into hell, thence &s;hall mine hand take them; though they climb up in|to Heaven, thence will I being them <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">; and though they

hide them&s;elves in the top of Carmel, I will &s;earch and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my &s;ight in the bottom of the &s;ea, thence will I command the &s;erpent and he &s;hall bite them.</HI> From hence it appears weak, fruitle&s;s and contemptible to &s;et the ob&s;tinacy of man again&s;t the end of the coming, the call, the command, the de&s;ign of the ex|altation, and the long-&s;uffering patience of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; e&s;|pecially if we con&s;ider <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xlv. 22, 23, where we have the divine oath that every knee &s;hall bow; it may be added,</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> It is the de&s;ign of the &s;econd coming of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to convince all that are ungodly, of all their ungodly deeds, and of all their hard &s;peeches which ungodly &s;inners have &s;poken again&s;t him, <HI>Jude</HI> 14, 15. Then every eye &s;hall &s;ee him, and they that pierced him and all kindred of the earth &s;hall wail becau&s;e of him, as we read <HI>Rev.</HI> i. 7. Compare this with <HI>Zech.</HI> xii. 10, and they &s;hall look upon me, whom they have pierced, and they &s;hall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only &s;on, and be in bitterne&s;s for him as one is in bitterne&s;s for his fir&s;t born Here is wailing, mourn|ing and bitterne&s;s at the &s;ight of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive language we can imagine. See <HI>Jeremiah</HI> ix. 10, 18, 19, which perhaps none can form an adequate idea of, but &s;uch as have been called <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">nto the de&s;cribed circum&s;tances; which yet cannot be viewed as the language of de&s;pair, for how then can we under&s;tand the following words, <HI>even &s;o amen.</HI> But if we may under&s;tand <HI>John</HI> as &s;peaking of tho&s;e who pierced him being brought every knee of them to bow to him, with the wailing of repentence, then the <HI>even &s;o amen</HI> appears agreeable to the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel. Un|doubtedly then every mouth will be &s;topped, and all the world guilty before God, which when the apo&s;tle mentions, in <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 19, he adds, in ver&s;e 21, <HI>But now the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of God without the law is manife&s;t, being witne&s;&s;ed by the law, and the prophets, even the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, which is by faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto all, and upon all that believe; For there is no difference,</HI> re&s;pecting the purcha&s;e of Chri&s;t, who died for all; and re&s;pecting the divine will, <HI>who will have all men to be &s;aved, and come to the know|ledge of the truth,</HI> which agree<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> with <HI>Romans</HI> xi. 32. <HI>he hath
<PB N="22" REF="018809_0021_0FA8235CB8BEE6B8">
concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy on all.</HI> This doctrine mu&s;t be &s;hocking to tradition, and no wonder, for <HI>O! the depth of the riches both of the wi&s;dom and knowledge of God, how un&s;earchable his judgments, and his ways pa&s;t finding out.</HI> It appears to agree with the end and de&s;ign of Chri&s;t&punc;s prayer, for his own immediate di&s;ci|ples, and for them that &s;hall believe through their word, as expre&s;&s;ed <HI>John</HI> xvii. 21, 23. <HI>That they all may be one as thou father in me, and I in thee; that they al&s;o may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me. I in them and thou in me, that the world may know that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me.</HI> The very circum&s;tance that the di&s;ciples were in, (ver&s;e 8) and have known &s;urely, that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou did&s;t &s;end me. The manife&s;tation of this onene&s;s I conceive to be what is called the manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God, which the ear|ne&s;t expectation of the creature waiteth for. Every crea|ture, both believers and unbelievers, are in &s;ome way groan|ing and traveling together for this, as we &s;ee in <HI>Rom.</HI> viii 32. <HI>For we know that the whole creation</HI> (in the Bible margin it is every creature. I am informed it is the &s;ame word u&s;ed in <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> xvi. 15, <HI>Go preach the go&s;pel every creature)</HI> the whole cre|ation, or every creature, <HI>groaneth and traveleth in pain to|gether.</HI> I know not of one of the human race that is not in &s;ome way groaning under the bondage of corruption. Ver&s;e 23, <HI>And not only they&punc; but our&s;elves al&s;o, which have the fir&s;t fruits of the &s;pirit, even we our&s;elves groan within our|&s;elves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body</HI> &mdash;the whole body&punc; of which Chri&s;t is the head.&mdash;This agrees with the de&s;ign of Je&s;us being made under the law, that we might receive the adoption of &s;ons.</P>
<P N="2">II. Tho&s;e of oppo&s;ite character, that thank God they are not as other men&punc; but pride them&s;elves in their own religious characters, to the de&s;pi&s;ing tho&s;e above mentioned. To &s;uch repentence and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins are preached in the name of Je&s;us. Alas, if they look for remi&s;&s;ion in their own name, or on account of any di&s;tinction in them&punc; it will di&s;appoint them; for, &s;ays the prophet, all our righteou&s;ne&s;s is as filthy rags: And <HI>Paul,</HI> &s;peaking of his, &s;ays, what things I counted
<PB N="23" REF="018809_0022_0FA8235CE7090EA8">
gain tho&s;e I count lo&s;s for Chri&s;t. But what has been already &s;aid on <HI>John</HI>'s preaching may &s;uffice on this head.</P>
<P N="3">III. Such as are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and perplexed for want of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, wi&s;hing for &s;ome inherent qualifications or to perform many external duties, to recommend them to the divine fa|vour, or are ready to wi&s;h they were as &s;uch and &s;uch, who they apprehend to have high attainments, and great charact|ers for piety, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with the anxious inquiry, wherewith|all &s;hall I come before the Lord? Will he be plea&s;ed with co&s;tly &s;acrifices&mdash;thou&s;ands of rams, or ten thou&s;and rivers of oil, or my fir&s;t born for my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion;&mdash;the &s;uit of my body for the &s;in of my &s;oul?&mdash;He hath &s;hewed thee, O man, what good is the only all-&s;ufficient one, to recommend thee to to the divine favour, in the fini&s;hed work of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in which is full remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and a call to repent of &s;eek|ing it any other where. <HI>God is love, and in this was mani|fe&s;ted the love of God towards us, becau&s;e God &s;ent his only begotten &s;on, that we might live through him. God was in Chri&s;t reconciling the world unto him&s;elf, not imputing their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> I pa&s;&s;es unto them</HI> Only view the character of the true God as manife&s;ted in Chri&s;t. (El&s;ewhere we cannot &s;ee him, for no man hath &s;een God at any time; the only begotten &s;on, who was in the bo&s;om of the father, he hath declar<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> him). Agreeable to <HI>Zechariah</HI> ix. 9, <HI>He is ju&s;t and having &s;alvation.</HI> I&s;aiah xlv. 21, <HI>I the Lord, and none be&s;ide me, a ju&s;t God, and a Saviour, and none be&s;ide.</HI> If ju&s;tice and &s;alvation is united in the character of the only living and true God, and he calls to all the ends of the earth to look to him, and be &s;aved, if it be rightly under&s;tood, it is enough to chear the heart of the mo&s;t forlorn and dejected in any corner of the earth.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Tho&s;e that believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, that he hath fully obeyed the precepts of the law, in his life&punc; and &s;uffered the penalty in his death, to the &s;atisfaction of ju&s;tice, and thereby made full remi&s;&s;ion, as witne&s;&s;ed in his re&s;urrection, &s;o that their minds are at peace and re&s;t in his fini&s;hed work alone, as their only ground of hope&mdash;are hereby called to repentance, as tho&s;e that are under the highe&s;t obligation thereunto, a|greeable to <HI>Ezek.</HI> xvi. 63, <HI>That thou may&s;t remember, and be a&s;hamed, and confounded, and never open thy mouth any more
<PB N="24" REF="018809_0023_0FA8235D954C0AA8">
becau&s;e of thy &s;hame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou ha&s;t done &s;aith, the Lord God.</HI> Every view of every time, place and company, wherein they have &s;poken or done &s;e|cretly or openly&punc; tho&s;e things that were contrary to the law of God, or whereby they have been going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, in oppo&s;ition to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, is ever matter of &s;hame and abhorrance, and of admiration of the grace that appears in remi&s;&s;ion and reconciliation; and the law of love, that the go&s;pel binds on Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples to love one another, as he hath loved them, mu&s;t ever open a &s;ource of repentance when their conduct is counter thereto.</P>
<P>How un&s;uitable is it for Chri&s;ts di&s;ciples to practice up|on that old Phara&s;aick tradition, <HI>thou &s;halt love thy neigh|bour and hate thine enemy</HI>; when Je&s;us reconciled them when they were enemies, and taught them to love their enemies.</P>
<P>How un&s;uitable for tho&s;e of them that have this world's goods, and &s;ee their brethren in need, to &s;hut up their bowels of compa&s;&s;ion from them, when Je&s;us <HI>though he was rich for our &s;akes became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich</HI>; who has kindly told us, <HI>the poor ye have always with you, and when&s;oever ye will ye may do them good</HI>; E&s;|pecially when he has &s;aid, <HI>who&s;oever &s;hall give you a cup of water, to drink in my name, becau&s;e ye belong to Chri&s;t, ve|rily I &s;ay unto you, he &s;hall not lo&s;e his reward; ina&s;much as ye did it unto one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my brethren, ye did unto me.</HI></P>
<P>How un&s;uitable to the above-mentioned ground of &s;atisfac|tion in the fini&s;hed work of Chri&s;t, is every branch of conduct and conver&s;ation unbecoming the go&s;pel, when it lays the be|lievers of it under the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ible, eternal obligations to look upon them&s;elves, their time, talents, intere&s;t and op|portunities, as not their own, but belonging to their redeem|er, and to be ever employed to his glory. If the&s;e things be duly con&s;idered, with the various thoughts they lead to, they will open up rea&s;ons for daily repentance to the believers of the go&s;pel, with a full conviction they can have no confidence in the fle&s;h, but their rejoicing mu&s;t be in Chri&s;t Je&s;us alone, to whom be glory forever.</P>
