<P>But the Government hearing nothing of the <HI>Norridgawock</HI>'s Di&s;po&s;ition for or De|&s;ires of a Treaty, till the 16th of la&s;t Month, by a Letter (which if you de&s;ire &s;hall be n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w read to you) from a Number of that Tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to the Governour, de&s;iring him to come him&s;elf (if he could) or appoint &s;ome other Gentlemen for that Pur|po&s;e, readily agreed thereto; but as the Affairs of the Province would not permit the Governour to appear in Per&s;on, he hath again &s;ent us fully impowered to treat with you.

<P>The Engli&s;h are di&s;po&s;ed for the Continuance of Peace; and as a Proof thereof, the Government have directed us to a&s;&s;ure you, That upon the Renewal of your Friend&s;hip with them, and &s;o long as you (and the other Tribes of Ea&s;tern Indians) &s;hall continue in Amity with the Engli&s;h, and keep firm and inviolable the Peace made; they may depend upon receiving from the Government, in the Month of <HI>October</HI> annually, a &s;uitable Pre&s;ent in Token of the Friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them and this Government; which we, in the Name of the Government, accordingly now do.</P></Q>

<P>There has of late Mi&s;chief been done among us; but now we are all come to bury it: In order whereto, we are for proceeding upon Governour DUMMER's Treaty, by which it was concluded, That the Engli&s;h &s;hould inhabit the Lands as far as the Salt-Water flowed, and no further; and that the Indians &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the re&s;t.
