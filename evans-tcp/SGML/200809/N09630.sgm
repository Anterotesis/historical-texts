<HEAD>REASONS WHY The People called QUAKERS do not pay TYTHES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. BECAUSE Tythes were appointed by God, only under the <HI>Mo&s;aical</HI> Law, for the Portion of the <HI>Levites</HI> in lieu of their Inheritance in the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> as well as for their Service in the Temple, which being long aboli&s;hed and de&s;troyed, all Ob|ligation to pay Tythe, as of God's Appoint|ment, cea&s;ed therewith.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e being a Part of the ceremoni|al Law, which was abrogated by our Savi|our's offering him&s;elf once for all a propitia|tory Sacrifice for the Sins of the whole World, to pay or receive Tythes now, is to continue that in Part, which he came to aboli&s;h.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e we are of the Judgment, all compul&s;ory Maintenance of Mini&s;ters is con|trary to the Doctrine of Chri&s;t Je&s;us our great Lord and Law-giver, who fir&s;t and a|bove all others &s;hould be heard in this Mat|ter,
<PB N="4" REF="012257_0004_0F8A6BD5F710BDA0">
and who&s;e Injunction we are of Opinion virtually prohibits the Practice under the Go&s;pel, as the &s;ame is expre&s;&s;ed in his Charge to the fir&s;t Mini&s;ters thereof, <HI>Matth.</HI> x. 8. <HI>Freely ye have received, freely give.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Becau&s;e we find no Precept nor Pre|cedent in the New Te&s;tament for the receiv|ing or paying of Tythes: But on the con|trary we under&s;tand the Payment of Tythes, and all forced Maintenance of Mini&s;ters to be in direct Oppo&s;ition to the Apo&s;tolical Doctrine and Practice, as the &s;ame are re|corded in the &s;acred Writings of that Age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts xx. 33, 34, 35.</NOTE> and evidently appears from the following concurring Scriptures. <HI>I have, &s;aith</HI> Paul, <HI>coveted no Man's Silver or Gold, or Apparel; yea, you your&s;elves know, that the&s;e Hands have mini&s;tred unto my Nece&s;&s;ities, and to tho&s;e that are with me, I have &s;hewed you, that &s;o labouring you ought to &s;upport the Weak, For ye remember, Brethren,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The&s;. ii. 9.</NOTE> <HI>our Labour and Travail, for labouring Night and Day, becau&s;e we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached unto you the Go&s;pel of God. For we behaved not our&s;elves di&s;orderly among you,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 The&s;. iii. 7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>neither did we eat any Man's Bread for nought but wrought with Labour and Travail Night and Day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you;</HI> and again,
<PB N="5" REF="012257_0004_0F8A6BD5F710BDA0">
<HI>What is my Reward then?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. ix<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. 18, 19.</NOTE> <HI>verily that when I preach the Go&s;pel I may make the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t without Charge that abu&s;e not my Power in the Go&s;pel.</HI> And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> who well under&s;tood his great Ma&s;ter's Mind herein, writes thus to tho&s;e who had been called to the &s;piritual O|ver&s;ight of the Churches. <HI>Feed the Flock of God which is among you, taking the Over&s;ight thereof, not by Con&s;traint,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. v. 2.3.</NOTE> <HI>but willingly, not for filthy Lucre, but of a ready mind, neither as being Lords over God's Heritage, but being En&s;amples to the Flock.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Becau&s;e by Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, par|ticularly <HI>Selden</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of Tythes, it ap|peareth that Tythes were not claimed, or &s;aid in the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Church for the three fir&s;t Centuries.</P>
<P N="6">6. Becau&s;e Tythes were one of the many Innovations and Impo&s;itions introduced in the Church, in the Night of gro&s;s Darkne&s;s and Apo&s;tacy from the original Purity, and as &s;uch to be rejected, with&s;tood and te&s;tified again&s;t in the Reformation or Return from the Apo&s;tacy.</P>
<P N="7">7. Becau&s;e Tythes for the &s;ole U&s;e of the Pari&s;h-Prie&s;t obtained not till about the 13th Century, when they were appointed
<PB N="6" REF="012257_0005_0F8A6BD7F7CB0908">
to be &s;o paid by a decretal Epi&s;tle of Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> III.</P>
<P N="8">8. Becau&s;e the Ordinance of the Pope, directing the Payment thereof, appears a plain Contradiction to the Ordinance of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, who&s;e Ordinances in point of Con&s;cience, we are bound to obey.</P>
<P>"But we find it is urged again&s;t us, that the Clergy do not now claim Tythe by Di|vine Right, but as the Provi&s;ion for their Support appointed by the Laws of the Land; that although they were formerly granted by Princes or People bigotted to <HI>Popery,</HI> and blinded by mi&s;guided Zeal, or paid in Compli|ance with the Ordinances of <HI>Popes or Popi&s;h</HI> Councils: Yet being now the Grant of the Parliament, and the Payment thereof by the Legi&s;lature ordained and made a Part of the Laws of the Land; it is the Duty of all, as Subjects to comply therewith, and to pay or &s;et out their Tythe as the Law directs."</P>
<P>To this we an&s;wer, that we pay all due Re&s;pect to the Laws of the Land, and where for Con&s;cience-&s;ake, we cannot actively comply with the Law, we have patiently &s;ubmitted to the Penalties annexed to the Non-compliance therewith: And when the&s;e Penalties become greivous, we have, with proper Re&s;pect, not thought it unrea&s;onable
<PB N="7" REF="012257_0005_0F8A6BD7F7CB0908">
or unbecoming us, to lay our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Ca&s;e before Parliament, in order to &s;eek Redre&s;s.</P>
<P>But this Objection appears to us more &s;pe|cious than &s;olid: The National Laws in this Particular are grounded on Con&s;iderations inadmi&s;&s;ible by us, they enforce the Pay|ment of Tythes on the Suppo&s;ition of Divine Right, as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preamble to the Act 32 Hen. VII.</NOTE> <HI>due to God and holy Churh,</HI> who|ever therefore claims Tythe by the Laws, virtually claims them as due by Divine Right, for the Law, as far we under&s;tand, grants them on no other Con&s;iderations, and therefore our Rea&s;ons again&s;t paying them are not invalidated by the Rea&s;oning of &s;uch as urge the Law of the Land again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Yet further our Scruple is really con&s;cien|tious, we think our Saviour hath utterly a|boli&s;hed Tythes, with the ceremonial Law to which they belonged, and hath virtually prohibited all extorted Maintenance to Go&s;|pel Mini&s;ters; that his immediate Followers &s;o believed and &s;o acted is evident to us from the whole Tenor of their Writings: that his Authority in his Church is &s;uperior to every human Authority, we pre&s;ume will be uni|ver&s;ally allowed; that no Man or Body of Men as Men are infallible, is a <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Principle; and that neither the Magi&s;trate
<PB N="8" REF="012257_0006_0F8A6BD96CEF9DC8">
nor the Legi&s;lature, more than any other Men can an&s;wer for our doing or omitting, what in Con&s;cience we believe to be our Du|ty.</P>
<P>On the&s;e clear Principles we think our|&s;elves ju&s;tified in not paying Tythes, in with|holding our active Compliance with the Laws of the Land whieh enjoin us to pay them, and, declining voluntarily to contribute in any Way to the forced Support of Mini&s;ters: On the &s;ame Principles, we allow no Sti|pends for the Support of our own.</P>
<P>We admit the Power of the Civil Magi|&s;trate and the Obligation of human Laws their full Scope in Civil Society, as far as they regard meerly Civil Matters, and &s;o far we pay full Submi&s;&s;ion thereto, re&s;erving to God the Things which are God's, parti|cularly the &s;ole Dominion over the Con&s;ci|ence; whoever will carry his Rea&s;oning from the Force of human Laws farther than this, in our Apprehen&s;ion, will extend it be|yond the Limits of Scripture, of the Prin|ciples of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, and tho&s;e of the Reformation.</P>
<P>From Scripture, where human Laws con|tradicted the Divine Law in the Con&s;cience, we have &s;undry In&s;tances of Divine Appro|bation
<PB N="9" REF="012257_0006_0F8A6BD96CEF9DC8">
attending the preferring of the Divine Law.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Shadrach, Me&s;hach</HI> and <HI>Abednego,</HI> who refu&s;ed Compliance with the King's Decree in falling down to wor&s;hip the golden Image. 2dly, Of <HI>Daniel,</HI> who in Di&s;obedience to the Law of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> with his Windows open towards <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> prayed and gave Thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. 3dly, In that of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> who, when commanded by the Rulers of the <HI>Jews</HI> to &s;peak no more in the name of Je&s;us, dur&s;t not yield Obedi|ence to their Command, rea&s;oning thus: "Whether it be right in the Sight of God to hearken unto you more than to God, judge ye&middot;" <HI>Acts</HI> iv. 19. On this Principle the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Martyrs &s;ealed their Te&s;timony with their Blood; and on this Principle the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Reformers expired in the mid&s;t of the Flames.</P>
<P>We tru&s;t this Objection is now fully an|&s;wered on inconte&s;tible Principles, and that no injurious In&s;inuations can be fairly drawn from our Rea&s;oning, as if we meant any Parallel between the Rulers of tho&s;e Times, and our own: We are fully &s;en&s;ible of our Obligation to the pre&s;ent Government, for their Indulgences to us: Our Conduct be|&s;peaks our Di&s;po&s;ition: To Facts as the be&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="012257_0007_0F8A6BD9CD4F3618">
Witne&s;&s;es thereof we appeal for the Upright|ne&s;s of our Intentions: To tho&s;e intru&s;ted with the Sword of Magi&s;tracy, we dare re|fer our&s;elves for a Te&s;timony of our peacea|ble Demeanour and ready Obedience to the Legal Rule.</P>

<HEAD>BRIEF REMARKS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE modern Advocates for Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Impo&s;itions alledge,</P>
<P N="1">1. That Tithes are become in this Nati|on, a Demand of a <HI>civil Nature,</HI> becau&s;e they are given by the Laws of the Land.</P>
<P N="2">2. That they are <HI>a Debt ju&s;tly due</HI> to the legal Claimants, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="3">3. That they are <HI>equitable Demands,</HI> be|cau&s;e every Tenant in the Kingdom, of whom they are required, is allow'd the Va|lue of them by his Landlord, in the Rent of his Farm.</P>
<P N="4">4. From the&s;e Premi&s;es they infer, that &s;uch as refu&s;e <HI>actually</HI> to pay them when de|manded, whether they be of the &s;ame Com|munion with the Claimants, or con&s;cienti|uos Di&s;&s;enters from them, act contrary to
<PB N="4" REF="012257_0009_0F8A6BDB4C0C4638">
moral Hone&s;ty, and the Precepts of the Go&s;|pel which command Submi&s;&s;ion to the high|er Powers.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e Allegations appears to be founded upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that Laws made by a civil Power render the Subjects of tho&s;e Laws of a civil Nature. But certainly &s;pi|ritual Matters do not change their Nature, and become civil, through any Exertion of human Authority concerning them.</P>
<P>Tithes were exacted in this Nation for|merly upon Principles wholly &s;uper&s;titious, as particularly appears from the Grant of King <HI>Stephen;</HI> the Preamble to which runs in this manner:
<Q>Becau&s;e through the Pro|vidence of Divine Mercy, we know it to be &s;o ordered, and by the Church's publi&s;hing it far and near, every Body has heard, that by the Di&s;tribution of Alms, Per&s;ons may be ab&s;olved from the Bonds of Sin, and acquire the Rewards of heavenly Joys. I <HI>Stephen,</HI> by the Grace of God King of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> being willing to have a Part with them <HI>who by an happy kind of Trading,</HI> exchange heavenly Things for earthly, and &s;mitten with the Love of <HI>God,</HI> and for the Salvati|on of my own Soul, and the Souls of my Father and Mother, and all my Forefathers and Ance&s;tors,</Q>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> He then proceeds to
<PB N="5" REF="012257_0009_0F8A6BDB4C0C4638">
the Confirmation of Tithes and other Grants, for the peculiar Emolument of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks.</P>
<P>To claim Tithes as civil Dues becau&s;e they have obtained the Sanction of the civil Power, is not according to the Sen&s;e of tho&s;e Laws upon which that Demand is founded. See Stat. 27th and 37th of <HI>Hen.</HI> viii. which after &s;uppo&s;ing them, in the Phra&s;e of tho&s;e Times, <HI>due to God and holy Church,</HI> and that withholding the Payment of them, is acting <HI>again&s;t right and good Con&s;cience,</HI> do not make an A&s;&s;ignment of Tithes to the Clergy, <HI>de novo,</HI> as a new Grant, but <HI>taking it for grant|ed,</HI> that they are due to them <HI>by Divine Right, ex officio,</HI> or by virtue of their office, do therefore enforce the Payment of them. And accordingly, both the&s;e Statutes, and that of <HI>Edward</HI> vi. which is grounded upon the&s;e, re&s;train all Suits and Trials on account of Tithes to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts; which demon&s;trate they were <HI>not enacted as Dues of a civil Nature.</HI> Thus, the&s;e very Laws which are &s;aid to render this Demand of a civil Nature, evidently imply the contrary, by pre&s;uming it is of Divine Right; and as the Clergy claim Tithes upon the Authority of the&s;e Laws, they mu&s;t claim them upon that Pre&s;umption. If they have no Divine Right, they have therefore no Right at all. The Truth is, they have procured Power, by Laws grounded on erroneous Principles,
<PB N="6" REF="012257_0010_0F8A6BDC0CAF19D0">
to demand and force them out of the Hands of the Owners.</P>
<P>Tithes are not impo&s;ed in the manner of a civil Tax. They are not paid to civil Of|ficers. They are founded on religious Con|&s;iderations. The Intent of impo&s;ing them is, to &s;upport religious Mini&s;ters in the Pur|&s;uit of religious Duties. Being not requir|ed for a civil, but a religious Purpo&s;e, the Payment of them is to be treated as a Matter of religious Concern.</P>
<P>I with plea&s;ure acknowledge, that I am well a&s;&s;ured, divers of the Clergy appear tender of exacting upon Di&s;&s;enters from the legal E&s;tabli&s;hment, being neither willing to u&s;e Force upon Con&s;cience, nor to claim any Part of the Property of tho&s;e who receive no Obligation at their Hands. Yet the Con|duct of many &s;ufficiently evidence, they have not yet laid a&s;ide the Practice <HI>of reaping where they have not &s;own, and gathering where they have not &s;trawed.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding which, it is a certain Truth, that no other Mini&s;try upon Earth but that of the Tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> who were allow'd no landed Inheritances, appear to have been Divinely authorized to receive Tithes of the People. The&s;e there|fore having a Divine Command for them, had a Divine Right in them; yet were not impowered to take them by Force, but to
<PB N="7" REF="012257_0010_0F8A6BDC0CAF19D0">
receive them as an Offering from their Bre|thren.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. ii. 16, 17.</NOTE> The ju&s;t Condemnation of <HI>Hophni</HI> and <HI>Phinehas</HI> is a &s;tand|ing Sentence upon all who &s;ucceed them in <HI>forcible Practices.</HI> In the fulne&s;s of Time, CHRIST,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. x. 4.</NOTE> <HI>who is the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth,</HI> by the Introduction of <HI>Christianity,</HI> aboli&s;hed the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Law and its Prie&s;thood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. vii. 12, 13.</NOTE> with all the Services and Appropriations thereunto be|longing. Since that Time, no Sett of Mini&s;ters upon Earth can &s;hew a Divine Right to the Tenth of other Men's Produce, on account of their Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The Command of Our Lord to his Me&s;&s;engers is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. x. 8.</NOTE> <HI>freely ye have re|ceived, freely give.</HI> This clearly intimates, his Mini&s;try is not a &s;chola&s;tic, or human Acqui&s;ition, that a Man may be ex|pen&s;ively and externally bred to, or that he ought to be bred to <HI>for a Livelihood,</HI> but <HI>the free gift of</HI> GOD <HI>for the People,</HI> and that it ought to be <HI>as freely di&s;pen&s;ed to them</HI> by his Mini&s;ters. Yet &s;eeing it is ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;a|ry the&s;e &s;hould be provided for, when called from their proper Employments at Home, to attend the Service of the Go&s;|pel Abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 10.</NOTE> for <HI>the Workman is wor|thy of his Meat</HI>; therefore they have a Right to partake of what is &s;et before them,
<PB N="8" REF="012257_0011_0F8A6BDCDAC23840">
and to accept &s;uch Requi&s;ites as are freely communicated to them, by tho&s;e who re|ceive them and their Doctrine, who&s;e Duty it is to mini&s;ter to their Nece&s;&s;ities. Yet the Servants of CHRIST <HI>are not authoriz'd by him to demand, much le&s;s to force</HI> any Thing from <HI>tho&s;e who reject their Te&s;timony.</HI> They are not by the Scriptures allow'd, either Do|minion over their Faith, or over their Pur|&s;es. This hath been the U&s;urpation of after Times, under the grand Apo&s;tacy.</P>
<P N="2">II. As the Foundation upon which Tithes are exacted is not of a civil Nature, neither can they be a <HI>ju&s;t Debt</HI> upon tho&s;e who are of di&s;tinct Societies in point of Religion from that of the Demanders. The <HI>Quakers</HI> in par|ticular, have no Connection with the legally e&s;tabli&s;hed Clergy, but in a natural or in a civil Relation. They are not of the &s;ame religious Society with them, therefore the&s;e are <HI>no Mini&s;ters to them,</HI> and by con&s;equence, can have no equitable Demand upon them as &s;uch.</P>
<P>The freeborn People, or civil Body of this Nation, &s;ince <HI>Prote&s;tanti&s;m</HI> gain'd the A&s;|cendant, con&s;i&s;ts not of any one Sort of Pro|fe&s;&s;ors, whether more or le&s;s in Number, but of many different religiou&s;ly-connected Societies, each of whom has its own peculiar Mini&s;ters. The Mini&s;ters of any one of the&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="012257_0011_0F8A6BDCDAC23840">
Societies, are not Mini&s;ters to any other of the&s;e Societies; therefore no one particular Sett of the&s;e Mini&s;ters can, with Propriety, be called the Clergy, or Mini&s;try of the Na|tion, nor any Demand be ju&s;tly made upon the whole civil Body by them as &s;uch; for they are Mini&s;ters to no other Part of the Community, but that one religious Society they are joined to, and adopted by. And every Per&s;on freed from the Shackles of Pre|judice, and really di&s;po&s;ed to Uprightne&s;s and Impartiality, mu&s;t ea&s;ily di&s;cover the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of every &s;uch Society's &s;up|porting their own Mini&s;ters, who think they ought to be maintained, without &s;eeking to &s;ave their own Pockets, by <HI>forcibly obliging</HI> tho&s;e of other Societies to a&s;&s;i&s;t in defraying <HI>the Expences proper to them&s;elves only.</HI> And as it is rea&s;onable, it would not be le&s;s ho|nourable, in that large religious Body, out of whom the Legi&s;lature and Magi&s;tracy are &s;elected, to maintain their own Mini&s;ters, without putting them upon, or allowing them in the di&s;agreeable and di&s;reputable Practice of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing others for that Prupo&s;e. The Enjoyment of all the lucrative Advan|tages of Government among&s;t them&s;elves, added to their own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, would certain|ly well enable them to afford it. This would al&s;o contribute much to the Peace of the Com|munity, and the Security of private Familes, as it would prevent all future Occa&s;ion to gra|tify
<PB N="10" REF="012257_0012_0F8A6BDD8C07BA28">
a Spirit in the Clergy injurious to them|&s;elves as well as others, by entru&s;ting them with a Power of an oppre&s;&s;ive Nature, over the Liberty and Properties of tho&s;e who con|&s;cientiou&s;ly di&s;&s;ent from them.</P>
<P>The encroaching Part of the Clergy have always adopted, with peculiar Fondne&s;s, the Words <HI>Right, Dues,</HI> and <HI>Property</HI>; and con|&s;tantly &s;tile their Demands by the&s;e Names, in order to impre&s;s them upon others as &s;uch, and too many have been taken with the Snare. The&s;e Terms are ju&s;tly applicable to Inheritances fairly de&s;cended, to Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions hone&s;tly acquired, or uprightly purcha&s;ed. For in the&s;e the Proprietors have a ju&s;t and moral Right, was there no external Law in Being to confirm it. To them ju&s;t Law gives no Right, it only adds Security to Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. If by any Law this Property be render'd in&s;ecure, or any Part thereof alie|nated from the Proprietor again&s;t his Will, or without yielding him an Equivalent, &s;uch Law is a Violation of Equity, which is GOD'S &s;tanding Law, and mu&s;t therefore be in its Nature null and void; for no human Au|thority is divinely warranted to di&s;pen&s;e with the Law of Equity.

But this cannot be &s;aid of &s;uch Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions as are only given to any by Law, to which there is a prior or ju&s;ter Claim in others.</P>
<P>An erroneou&s;ly founded Law may autho|rize a Per&s;on to commit wrong with legal Impunity, but it cannot &s;anctify the Act of wrong, nor ju&s;tify the Actor in reality. If it could, there would be no Nece&s;&s;ity to render an Equivalent to private Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, for the Damage done to their E&s;tates in order to the publick Service. But certainly the Legi&s;la|ture judges Right, in impowering the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners and Tru&s;tees it appoints to erect publick Buildings, or to lay out Roads, to make Compen&s;ation to the Owners of private Property, for the Injury their E&s;tates may &s;uffer thereby. And why the Clergy &s;hould be indulged with a Prerogative to act as if Wrong was Right in their Hands, is what the re&s;t of Mankind want a Rea&s;on for. 'Tis natural from their Station and Pretences, rather to expect a better, than a wor&s;e Ex|ample from them than from others.

<P N="3">III. It is alledg'd, that Tithes are equitable Claims, becau&s;e every Tenant is allowed the Value of them by his Landlord, in the Rent of his Farm.</P>
<P>Were this a real Fact in the Ca&s;e of others, it has no relation to the <HI>Quaker,</HI> who makes no &s;uch Bargain with his Landlord, nor who could accept of no &s;uch Conditions, were they propo&s;ed to him.

But this will not always content the Par&s;on. If he cannot force the <HI>Quaker</HI> into the Sin of Hypocri&s;y, by an active and vo|luntary Delivery of Tithe again&s;t his Con|&s;cience, he'll &s;ometimes ab&s;urdly complain he is defrauded. Thus his Demand is not only for what he improperly &s;tiles <HI>his Due,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="012257_0014_0F8A6BDF46DAA768">
but al&s;o for what cannot po&s;&s;ibly be due to any Man: <HI>the Sovereignty of other Men's Con|&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>Our Compliance again&s;t Con&s;cience hath frequently been urged by Clerical Advocates, as a point of Gratitude nece&s;&s;arily due to the Government, and expected by it, in return for the Relief it hath in other Re&s;pects af|forded us. As to the Government, we have not been wanting affectionately to ac|knowledge our Obligations, and to render it any Service in our Power, con&s;i&s;tent with our religious Duty, and we cannot in rea&s;on imagine, that its View in ea&s;ing our Con|&s;ciences in &s;ome Particulars, is to lay us un|der Obligation to violate them in others.</P>
<P>The Pretence of Tithes being paid by the Land, and therefore allow'd by the Land|lord to his Tenant, that he may pay the De|mand for him, is fallacious. For though the Proprietor may be obliged to let his Land for le&s;s than he might do, was not the Burden of Tithe upon it, 'tis not becau&s;e of any voluntary Contract between Landlord and Tenant, that the latter &s;hall pay Tithe for the account of the former; nor is the Value left in the Tenant's Hands for that Purpo&s;e. Every con&s;iderate Per&s;on mu&s;t readily di&s;|cover, <HI>it is not the Land,</HI> but <HI>the Increa&s;e</HI> that Tithes are taken out of; and that their A|mount
<PB N="15" REF="012257_0014_0F8A6BDF46DAA768">
is more or le&s;s, according to the Va|riation of the Increa&s;e: And if the Landlord is a Lo&s;er by rea&s;on of this Exaction, the Tenant is more &s;o, the Tithe being taken out of his Increa&s;e, and in proportion there|to.</P>
<P><HI>Anthony Pear&s;on, in his great Ca&s;e of Tithes,</HI> hath long &s;ince &s;hewed, that it is not the Land which pays the Tithe, where there is Land in the Ca&s;e, but the Produce which is rai&s;ed by the Skill, Care, Expence, and Labour of the Occupier, in who&s;e Power it is to make it <HI>much, little,</HI> or <HI>nothing,</HI> at his plea&s;ure. If he &s;ows it with Corn, it may happen, as it hath frequently done, that the Tithe is worth <HI>three times the Rent of the Land it grows upon.</HI> If he pa&s;tures it with Sheep, the Tithe will be le&s;s; and le&s;s &s;till if he feeds it with Cows, or breeding Cattle. If he eats up his Gra&s;s by Hor&s;es, or barren Cattle, an incon|&s;iderable Rate is required. If he plants Wood, and lets it &s;tand for Timber, or &s;tocks it with Bea&s;ts which are <HI>ferae Naturae,</HI> of a wild Na|ture, or lets his Land lie wa&s;te, or eats his Meadow, or Corn &s;tanding, no Tithe can be required. The&s;e In&s;tances evince, that Tithes are paid by the <HI>Stock,</HI> or <HI>per&s;onal E&s;tate</HI> of the Occupier, and not by the Land, for which the Tenant has not an Equivalent al|lowed him.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="012257_0015_0F8A6BE32C825538">Though the <HI>Quaker</HI> pay le&s;s Rent for a Farm with the Burden of Tithes upon it; than he might was it free from that Di&s;ad|vantage, 'tis not by way of Agreement with his Landlord to pay Tithes for him, as will clearly appear by-and-by, but becau&s;e his Landlord cannot let it higher to any Tenant, as every one is &s;en&s;ible the Tenth of the Produce, rai&s;ed upon &s;uch Land, will be taken from him.</P>
<P>But was the Argument under Con&s;idera|tion a good one in any re&s;pect, it reaches not the Ca&s;e where <HI>Quakers</HI> are the Land-Owners, nor where Land is out of the que&s;|tion, as in Cities, corporate Towns, and other Places where no <HI>praedial</HI> Tithe ari&s;es, and therefore a <HI>Modus,</HI> or certain Value in &s;tead of Tithe, is demanded of the Hou&s;e|holders as &s;uch, for the Maintenance of the Clergy, as by Law e&s;tabli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een, where Tithes are taken, it is entirely from the Produce of every Hu&s;bandman's and Hou&s;holder's E&s;tate, whether real or per&s;onal, from whence this Portion of their Property is alienated meerly by Law. And if when private Property is thus alienated from the right Owner, how|ever unju&s;tly, it is then become the <HI>equitable Right</HI> of tho&s;e the Law hath a&s;&s;ign'd it to, the Law in &s;uch ca&s;e doth not confirm and

defend Right where it properly is, but <HI>changes Wrong into Right,</HI> and may upon the &s;ame Foundation, overturn all the private Property in the Kingdom, and cau&s;e it to change hands at plea&s;ure, to the Ruin of the Right Owners, and for the peculiar Emolu|ment of tho&s;e, in a &s;eparate Intere&s;t, who may have Addre&s;s and Influence &s;ufficient to procure the Enaction of &s;uch Laws in their favour. But &s;urely this would be contrary to Equity, and that which would be totally wrong if wholly done, mu&s;t be wrong in part &s;o far as it goes, and will remain to be wrong &s;o long as it is continued, If an Incum|brance impo&s;ed upon Land, or the Produce thereof, continue till it le&s;&s;ens the Value of the Land, &s;uch Incumbrance, can never <HI>by that Continuance, equitably</HI> become the Pro|perty of its Procurers, though it may be forcibly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them. If we put the Ca&s;e fairly, we may readily perceive in whom the Right centers.</P>
<P>A Per&s;on &s;tands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an E&s;tate in Land, either by ju&s;t Inheritance, or fair Purcha&s;e, clear of all Incumbrance: A mem|ber of artful Men, in combination for their own particular Intere&s;t, by untrue Preten|ces procure a Law to impower them to de|mand, and upon refu&s;al to &s;eize a part of the Increa&s;e ari&s;ing from the Occupation of this Land, without rendering the Occupier any
<PB N="18" REF="012257_0016_0F8A6BE39E840300">
thing adequate for it: In con&s;equence of this Impo&s;ition the Value of the Land be|comes le&s;&s;en'd; &s;o that during the Continu|ance of this Burden, if it happens to be &s;old, it mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed of for le&s;s than its real Worth. Who in this Ca&s;e is the Lo&s;er? Certainly the <HI>Seller,</HI> and <HI>his rightly &s;ucceeding Heirs.</HI> If therefore the Purcha&s;er &s;tands ju&s;t|ly indebted to any Per&s;on on account of the Abatement in Price, occa&s;ioned by the Incum|brance, it cannot be to the <HI>Tithe-Claimer, who has no equitable Right</HI> in the E&s;tate, but to the <HI>Seller who has.</HI> But if the Tithe-Claimant annually takes from the Purcha&s;er to the <HI>exact Amount,</HI> of the Seller's Lo&s;s, in point of Equity, he &s;tands indebted to the Seller for it. If he take <HI>more than that Amount</HI> from the Purcha&s;er, he &s;tands indebted both to the Buyer and Seller. And if the Land-Owner, is oblig'd to let his Land at a Rent below its real Value, by rea&s;on of &s;uch Impo&s;ition, the Tithe-taker &s;tands Debtor to him for the Amount of the Difference in his Rent; &s;o he al&s;o doth to the Tenant, or Occupier, for all that is taken out of his Produce above this Difference. It is theirs in Equity, and mu&s;t ever remain to be their Right, and the Right of their proper Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors, unle&s;s by Gift, Sale, or Demi&s;e, they alie|nate it by their own Act, or Con&s;ent, and can never equitably revert from one Impo&s;er to another, by virtue of human Law, which
<PB N="19" REF="012257_0016_0F8A6BE39E840300">
whenever it differs from, and enforces again&s;t Equity, is unequal, and what is unequal is immoral, and by con&s;equence antichri&s;tian.</P>
<P>It has been alledg'd, that Becau&s;e the Buyer paysle&s;s for the Purcha&s;e of an E&s;tate, the Produce of which is &s;ubjected to the De|mand of Tithes, than he might do if it were not &s;o, that he therefore <HI>con&s;ents</HI> to the Pay|ment of them by making the Purcha&s;e; wherein he al&s;o <HI>avails him&s;elf</HI> of the Law, by the <HI>Abatement</HI> he receives in the Price.</P>
<P>That he who purcha&s;eth an E&s;tate, the Produce of which is Titheable, pays le&s;s for it than if it had remained free from that De|mand, is true; but why? Becau&s;e he can|not make a Rent of it an&s;werable to the full Value: therefore it is worth no more to him than he gives for it. If a piece of Land is Tithe-free, the Buyer pays the full Value for it, and fixes a Rent accordingly. If it is liable to the Demand of Tithe, he pays le&s;s for the Purcha&s;e, and receives a Rent proportionably lower to the difference in Price: So that the Matter &s;quares with the Landlord without his being affected with the Tithe. How then does he avail him&s;elf of the Law, in the Purcha&s;e, and bring him|&s;elf under Obligation to pay Tithe, which in reality he does not pay? If any Per&s;on receives the Benefit of the <HI>Abatement,</HI> 'tis not
<PB N="20" REF="012257_0017_0F8A6BE749EBE2F0">
the Landlord, but the Tithe-Exactor, who takes it from the Occupier; and the Lo&s;s which accrues in the <HI>Abatement,</HI> falls upon the original Seller under the Incumbrance, and his Heirs. And where the Land-Own|er occupies his own E&s;tate, he is liable to that Demand, not as Land-Owner, but as Occupier; and if he &s;tands equitably indebt|ed to any Per&s;on, for the Abatement in the Purcha&s;e, it mu&s;t be to tho&s;e in whom the Right, according to Equity, remains; that is, to the original Seller abovementioned, or to his rightly &s;ucceeeding Heirs; and not to tho&s;e Demanders who&s;e Claim is founded on untrue Preten&s;ions, and exacted by Law again&s;t Equity.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who plead the <HI>Gift of Tithes</HI> from former Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the Land, or that alledge the <HI>Length of Time,</HI> the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Claimants have been in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Impo&s;itions; I an&s;wer,</P>

<P><PB N="27" REF="012257_0020_0F8A6BE8CC23E900">Seeing therefore, we cannot actively com|ply with the&s;e Demands, without &s;etting human Authority above Divine, without joining hands with things again&s;t our Con&s;ci|ences to practice, and without falling into the Ab&s;urdity of acting a Self-contradiction; notwith&s;tanding the Abu&s;es we receive from our Oppo&s;ers, we mu&s;t &s;till chu&s;e rather pa|tiently to &s;uffer, than meanly to comply, or hyprocritically to conform.</P>
