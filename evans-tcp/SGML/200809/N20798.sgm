<HEAD>TRANSLATOR's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>BIOGRAPHY u&s;ually pre&s;ents to view &s;ome|thing to copy, and &s;omething to &s;hun. In the lives of eminent per&s;ons we &s;ometimes find great virtues allied to great vices; but the latter gene|rally outweigh the former. The mo&s;t exemplary demon&s;trate the error of believing infallibility an attribute of human greatne&s;s. None have been uniformly good, and, for the honor of human nature, we wi&s;h it could be &s;aid, none have been uniformly bad. The Hi&s;tory of <HI>MARIA AN|TOINETTE</HI> can be little el&s;e than an enumera|tion of licentious exce&s;&s;es and unprecedented crimes. Such was the depraved morals of this extraordinary woman, that her warme&s;t pane|gyri&s;ts have &s;carce pointed out in her character, a &s;ingle virtue to &s;natch her memory from un|mingled
<PB N="vi" REF="027308_0009_0FD3FE2240D1A7E0">
dete&s;tation. From the pencil, therefore, of the impartial biographer, the reader mu&s;t not expect to find depicted in this work, the congre|gated virtues, &s;miling like de&s;cending cherubs; but a groupe of mon&s;trous intrigues and gigantic vices, which mu&s;t excite a&s;toni&s;hment and horror.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are of opinion that exalted rank &s;hould be a &s;acred protection from the profane language of truth, may affect to revolt from what they will &s;tyle the indecency of this pub|lication. But the man of independent &s;pirit, the philo&s;opher, and the true republican, &s;ees through the medium of rea&s;on, with eyes un|dazzled by the glare of royalty, and rejoices when vice, though allied to greatne&s;s, is detected and expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be alleged that when the guilty have expiated their crimes by death, it is cruel and unju&s;t to puni&s;h their memories with infa|my. This &s;entiment, however amiable it may appear, is not &s;trictly ju&s;t. It is the province of Biography to &s;hew mankind what others
<PB N="vii" REF="027308_0010_0FD3FE23F4074278">
have been, that they may learn what them&s;elves ought to be. It paints the beauty of cha&s;tity, and the deformity of lubricity. It holds up vir|tue to allure, and vice to deter; the good to be imitated, and the bad to be dete&s;ted. The buoy which warns the mariner to avoid the rock of danger, is not le&s;s u&s;eful than the beacon which conducts him to the channel of &s;afety.</P>
<P>The celebrated heroine of the following pages has lately expired on a &s;caffold, the victim of an injured nation's ju&s;t re&s;entment. That amiable propen&s;ity of the human brea&s;t, which, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, inclines mankind to feel before they rea|&s;on, has been attacked, in the critical moment, by every enemy of the French republic and the <HI>RIGHTS OF MAN,</HI> with a de&s;ign to throw an odium on the French nation and the cau&s;e of liber|ty. The judges of Marie Antoinette have been calumniated, as murderers and regicides; and &s;he has been pathetically repre&s;ented as innocence &s;uf|fering martyrdom by the &s;word of audacious in|ju&s;tice and unrelenting cruelty. The atrocity of her crimes has been cau&s;ed in&s;en&s;ibly to di&s;appear
<PB N="viii" REF="027308_0011_0FD3FE27E02CF428">
from the eye which contemplated the &s;everity of her puni&s;hment; and the voice of rea&s;on has been drowned in the &s;obbing of pity. It will, however, appear, from a peru&s;al of this work, that the death of Marie Antoinette was not in|flicted by the &s;anguinary hand of wanton bar|barity, but by the &s;entence of ju&s;tice, temperate, lenient ju&s;tice, which long protracted the exac|tion of a forfeited life.</P>
<P>To make the knowledge of this fact acce&s;&s;ible to all; to wipe away the du&s;t which has been thrown in the public eye; and to render ineffec|tual &s;ome of the vile artifices which are in&s;iduou&s;ly practi&s;ed among us; in order to alienate our af|fections from regenerated France, a nation equal|ly virtuous and brave; for the&s;e purpo&s;es this publication makes its appearance. We are aware of the malicious &s;trictures it will be compelled to undergo, and we can al&s;o divine from what quarter they will originate. But we have de|clared the motives by which we are influenced; and &s;hall re&s;t &s;atisfied in the con&s;cious rectitude of our intentions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>THAT warmth of temperament, which afterwards led Marie to an almo&s;t unequal|led extreme of libidinous exce&s;&s;es, began very early to di&s;play it&s;elf. At an age when mo&s;t children are &s;trangers to &s;exual &s;en&s;a|tions, and all are ignorant of their cau&s;e and tendency, Antoinette had become ac|quainted with the my&s;teries of love. Before ten years had revolved over her head, &s;he was often &s;urprized in giving practical le&s;|&s;ons to her &s;i&s;ters, and in many other acts of juvenile wantonne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="027308_0013_0FD3FE2AE1BA1820">We cannot pretend to &s;ay with certainty on whom &s;he deigned to be&s;tow the en|joyment of her virgin charms. Her fir&s;t amours were probably conducted with a circum&s;pection which may have eluded di&s;|covery. It is, however, well known, that, at the age of fourteen, beauty was not thought the only circum&s;tance in which &s;he bore a re&s;emblance to the godde&s;s of love. Variety, even then, was talked of in the German court, as plea&s;ing to Antoinette, and it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed not to have been wanting to her enjoyments.</P>
<P>What was &s;u&s;pected in Germany, was, afterwards, when &s;he re&s;ided in France, fully e&s;tabli&s;hed as a fact. Succe&s;&s;ively an|gered by what they con&s;idered an unmerited di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, or proud of having been encir|cled in the arms of royalty, the favourites of Antoinette, from time to time, gratified their re&s;entment or their vanity, by di&s;co|vering their connexion with her.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="027308_0014_0FD3FE2C30C61580">The cardinal de Rohan was at this time amba&s;&s;ador at the court of Vienna. He be|came enamoured with the charms of Antoi|nette. Unprincipled in his morals, her|culean and hand&s;ome in his per&s;on, he dared to love, and he dared to hope. He im|proved the fir&s;t opportunity of declaring his pa&s;&s;ion, and met with a reception, of which he had no great rea&s;on to complain. He was gently chidden for his pre&s;umption, and forbidden in the mo&s;t <HI>unforbidding</HI> man|ner to per&s;i&s;t; while the artful glances of her eyes contradicted every word that fell from her lips. This interview, as might be expected, added new heat to the ardent wi&s;hes of this illu&s;trious hypocrite. A flame was now kindled in his bo&s;om, which burnt till it produced his de&s;truction. He now u&s;ed every artifice of which he was ma&s;ter, to bring his de&s;ign on her to a con&s;ummation. But all his exertions proved ineffectual; and he returned to France in di&s;appointment, and almo&s;t in de&s;pair.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="027308_0015_0FD3FE2DAF196750">His want of &s;ucce&s;s, at this time, was chiefly owing to a previous engagement on the part of Antoinette. A young German officer, with whom &s;he accidentally became acquainted, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a per&s;on with which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> was delighted, read his good fortune in her eyes, and in&s;tantly made &s;ome tender advances, which were received in the kinde&s;t manner. From this moment, a voluptuous intercour&s;e commenced be|tween this happy couple, that exi&s;ted for a length of time, far exceeding the duration of her &s;ub&s;equent amours. It was, how|ever, at la&s;t broken off by her departure for France; but &s;he &s;eemed, through life, to entertain an increa&s;ing fondne&s;s for the de|lightful tactics, in which &s;he had been in&s;tructed by this military Adonis.</P>
<P>It was &s;oon after the connexion between Antoinette and this officer was formed, that the cardinal made his declaration to her. We need not be &s;urprized at the mildne&s;s of the an&s;wer he received: it was &s;uch as might
<PB N="13" REF="027308_0016_0FD3FE2F3855F388">
be expected from &s;uch a woman. She was &s;eldom di&s;plea&s;ed by &s;olicitations of this kind, and, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of too much humanity to exerci&s;e the cruelty of repul&s;ion, even when &s;he did not grant, &s;he hardly denied.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>IT is unnece&s;&s;ary here to detail the cir|cum&s;tances which led to an union of the hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Bourbon, by the marriage of Marie Antoinette with the dauphin, &s;ince Louis XVI. king of France. This pretended reconciliation was in&s;in|cere on the Au&s;trian &s;ide. When Antoinette was about to depart from Vienna for France, &s;he entered into a league with her brother, Jo&s;eph II. emperor of Germany, again&s;t the liberty, property, and even the exi&s;|tence of the people of France, &s;olemnly
<PB N="14" REF="027308_0017_0FD3FE30AE69E1B8">
&s;wearing to accompli&s;h, if po&s;&s;ible, the de|&s;truction of that nation, which &s;he &s;till viewed with the antipathy of a natural ene|my. And to this horrid engagement &s;he proved faithful, as the &s;equel of the&s;e me|moirs will evince.</P>
<P>On her leaving Vienna, her mother, the great Maria There&s;a, is &s;aid to have been tran&s;ported with joy at the idea of the evils impending over France, in being &s;ubjected to a queen like Antoinette. Anticipating that ruin, which &s;he doubted neither the in|clination nor the ability of her daughter to effect, &s;he exclaimed, <Q>Now am I re|venged on France!</Q></P>
<P>Marie Antoinette arrived in France in the year 1768. She was then in her &s;eventeenth year. Her beauty, at all times incompara|ble, was now at its acm&egrave;. By the plenitude of her health, and the vivacity of her de&s;ires, her cheeks were flu&s;hed into a bloom, that, to the whitene&s;s of a neck and bo&s;om, which
<PB N="15" REF="027308_0018_0FD3FE35ED390E90">
&s;eemed animated alaba&s;ter, formed a contra&s;t the mo&s;t captivating. With her eyes &s;he could do what &s;he plea&s;ed; yet when left to them&s;elves they beamed nothing but inno|cent frankne&s;s, angelic benevolence, and mild dignity. Her per&s;on, proportioned with the mo&s;t &s;triking &s;ymmetry, was tall and maje&s;tic. She might, in &s;hort, have been taken as a perfect model, for another Venus de Medicis. No one beheld her without admiration; and no one will read her hi&s;tory without dete&s;tation. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch charms, had &s;he not wandered into every &s;hameful exce&s;s, and committed every crime that could alienate affection, &s;he had been adored by the people of France, who had long di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by a blind attachment to their &s;overeigns.</P>
<P>Born for plea&s;ures, and availing her&s;elf of that licentiou&s;ne&s;s of manners which reigned at court, Marie Antoinette, on her arrival, &s;acrificed nothing to etiquette. She entered alone, and whenever &s;he judged
<PB N="16" REF="027308_0019_0FD3FE39B8630F00">
proper, into the apartment of Louis XV. And under the pretext of &s;hewing her&s;elf to a people, whom, &s;he <HI>&s;aid,</HI> &s;he loved, and who&s;e affections &s;he wi&s;hed to obtain, &s;he walked out ten times a day, without e&s;cort. Her fir&s;t lady of honor, Madame de Noailles, pre&s;umed to repre&s;ent to her the improprie|ty of &s;uch conduct. Her advice was, how|ever, turned to ridicule, and procured her the nick-name of <HI>Madame Etiquette.</HI></P>
<P>Even the dauphin grew unea&s;y at that licentious gaity, and contempt of decorum, which were now daily exhibited in the con|duct of Antoinette. Happy had it been for France, if her conduct had excited in his brea&s;t that aver&s;ion which &s;he merited. But po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every artifice of her &s;ex, as well as all its charms, &s;he knew how to captivate the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible; and &s;he duped the heart of Louis into the mo&s;t extravagant fondne&s;s, and in&s;pired his bo&s;om with the mo&s;t impli|cit confidence.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="027308_0020_0FD3FE39C0AB3BF0">Meanwhile, Madame, the cidevant coun|te&s;s of Provence, conceived the mo&s;t inve|terate hatred again&s;t Antoinette. She beheld her beauty with all the pangs and all the malevolence of envy; and equally hurt by the &s;uperiority of her charms and her pow|er, &s;he &s;ecretly determined on revenge.</P>
<P>The counte&s;s d'Artois became al&s;o di&s;&s;a|tisfied with Antoinette. The attentions which the hu&s;band of the former lavi&s;hed on the latter, were beheld with jealous ap|prehen&s;ion. The counte&s;s had indeed never been perfectly plea&s;ed with his behaviour. From their earlie&s;t connexion, &s;he had found her&s;elf under the humiliating nece&s;&s;ity of &s;haring his favors with the vile&s;t of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>Antoinette and the&s;e two women, who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions bore a near re&s;emblance to her own, were ever meditating mi&s;chiefs. Their hu&s;bands were all equally pu&s;illanimous. Mon&s;ieur, the vaine&s;t and mo&s;t pedantic
<PB N="18" REF="027308_0021_0FD3FE3B56794BC0">
man in the kingdom, devoted all his mo|ments to his favorite &s;tudies of literature. De&s;titute of &s;en&s;ibility, and a &s;tranger to every &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;eemed as incapable of feeling as the mouldy volumes, to pore over which was his only delight and em|ployment. Philanthropic &s;peculations, and the philo&s;ophy of humanity, had never gain|ed admittance to his thoughts. The count d'Artois was continually plunged in the mo&s;t &s;hameful debaucheries, and ran with un&s;lackening pace the round of exce&s;&s;es, in daily di&s;&s;ipation and nocturnal riot. The temper of the dauphin was mild and phleg|matic; and his heart was fortunately inca|pable of acute &s;en&s;ation. His genius early di&s;covered it&s;elf to be a mechanical one; and he always appeared to be happier in a forge than in a palace. While employed in the former, a lively fancy might have imagined him fabricating chains for the nation, which he was de&s;tined to govern. He, however, di&s;played le&s;s ingenuity in
<PB N="19" REF="027308_0022_0FD3FE3CC5A0EB00">
his attempts to fix them on his &s;ubjects, than in manufacturing them.</P>
<P>Maurepas was at this time pre&s;ident of the council. Equally indifferent to all po|litical events, he knew no &s;olicitude except for his &s;tomach. He was the mo&s;t confirm|ed of epicures. Too carele&s;s for the mini|&s;try, and, at the &s;ame time, too amiable to be excluded from &s;ociety; while he neglect|ed the former, he was the delight and the &s;oul of the latter.</P>
<P>The count d'Artois, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an hand&s;ome figure, and a countenance full of vivacity, now attracted the eyes of Marie Antoinette. The reputation which he had acquired among women, had excited, in her brea&s;t, a wi&s;h to know the validity of its foundation; and &s;he determined to en|courage the attentions which he paid her. She had al&s;o another motive for favoring the advances of the count. She had become &s;olicitous to experience maternal feelings,
<PB N="20" REF="027308_0023_0FD3FE3DF4ED3990">
which &s;he imagined mu&s;t be delightful. She had al&s;o, on her departure from Ger|many, received an injunction from Maria There&s;a, to become, if po&s;&s;ible, a mother. By her cohabitation with Louis, her ferti|lity had not been rendered apparent. Whe|ther this circum&s;tance was owing to impo|tence on his part, or to &s;ome phy&s;ical con|trariety of temperament, we are unable to determine. Be this as it may, &s;he con&s;ider|ed d'Artois as the man, in the world, be&s;t adapted to the gratification of all her wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;iduities of the count were now increa&s;ed, and they were received with the highe&s;t complacency. His attachment to the queen was now talked of as having be|come mutual, and gave origin to much &s;candal. Nor were the reports which were circulated on this occa&s;ion confined to the court of France; they even reached the ears of the empre&s;s; and it may be well imagined that they &s;uffered no diminution by tran&s;portation. She was not &s;urpri&s;ed at
<PB N="21" REF="027308_0024_0FD3FE4319B1FCD8">
the crime, but &s;he was alarmed by the im|prudence of her daughter. In order, how|ever, to obtain more accurate information on this &s;ubject than could be derived from common fame, &s;he wrote to the cardinal de Rohan, reque&s;ting him to give her an account of the conduct of Antoinette. The de&s;ires which the latter formerly excited in his bo&s;om, had yet &s;uffered no abatement. He viewed the count d'Artois as a danger|ous and &s;ucce&s;sful rival; and, anxious to ef|fect a di&s;&s;olution of his connexion with Antoinette, he wrote an an&s;wer to There&s;a, which rather magnified than palliated the fault of her daughter. Of this letter we in&s;ert a copy.</P>

<P>My zealous attachment to the illu&s;tri|ous hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; the veneration with which you have in&s;pired me; and the generous reception with which I was honoured at your court, when I was &s;ent thither by my king; all the&s;e induce me

to yield an obedience to your commands which deeply wounds my heart. Ah, why have you not charged &s;ome other with the execution of this too painful commi&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>It is, alas! but too true, madam, that Antoinette, &s;ince her arrival in France, has forgotten all tho&s;e le&s;&s;ons of wi&s;dom and virtue with which your parental ten|derne&s;s was plea&s;ed to enrich her at part|ing. My duty obliges me to tell you the afflicting truth, that &s;he has become a fini&s;hed coquette, and that &s;he yields her|&s;elf almo&s;t wholly up to exce&s;&s;es. A re|port is confidently circulated, that &s;he prefers her brother-in-law to her hu&s;band. May God avert an event &s;o dreadful! Yet appearances, in this unhappy affair, but ill agree with our virtuous wi&s;hes.</P>

<P>This letter, being afterwards found among the papers of the empre&s;s, was &s;ent to An|toinette by her brother. This gave additi|onal force to that re&s;entment which &s;he had already conceived again&s;t its author: and in order to render her vengeance complete, &s;he &s;olicited for him the mo&s;t eminent places, to make his fall the more humiliating</P>

<P>AS variety was ever the pa&s;&s;ion of Antoi|nette, her connexion with the count now &s;uffered an interval, which was occupied by a new and more plea&s;ing object. The count Dillon, (often called the hand&s;ome Dillon) now returned to court, where he had formerly been a page. He now attract|ed every eye, and the queen was not the la&s;t on whom he made an impre&s;&s;ion. He was not permitted long to remain ignorant of the havock he had made in the heart of his &s;overeign; nor was the con&s;ummation of her ardent de&s;ires long po&s;tponed.</P>
<P>De&s;titute of wit, and unamiable in his manners, count Dillon was recommended by nothing but beauty. Such is the portrait of the hero of the day. The in&s;inuating
<PB N="25" REF="027308_0028_0FD3FE4F6A7431D0">
queen had, however, the art to make her un&s;u&s;pecting hu&s;band the friend of this un|principled and ungrateful villain. When he played, the king conde&s;cended to be his banker, and heaped on him many di&s;tin|gui&s;hing favors. A glaring indi&s;cretion, however, between the lovers at length alarmed the king. The queen gave a ball, at which &s;he &s;carcely danced except with Dillon. At length, pretending fatigue, &s;he threw her&s;elf into a chair, and pre&s;ently af|ter complained of a mo&s;t intolerable palpi|tation of the heart. The count ran, in a fright, to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, uncon&s;cious of the pre&s;ence of the company, thru&s;t his hand into her bo&s;om, the &s;eat of the com|plaint. As inattentive as the count to the company which gathered round in mute a&s;|toni&s;hment at his temerity, the queen forgot to remove the welcome intruder. The king at la&s;t &s;aid &s;omething expre&s;&s;ive of &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;plea&s;ure, and Dillon retired. She, however, with an embrace, and a few ten|der words, appea&s;ed his indignation, and re|moved
<PB N="26" REF="027308_0029_0FD3FE50E8DF68D0">
his &s;u&s;picions. Even Dillon him&s;elf was by her artful management, &s;oon rein|&s;tated in the favor and confidence of Louis. For &s;ome time &s;ub&s;equent to this reconci|liation, the lovers lived in the happie&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ecure familiarity.</P>
<P>But the time when Dillon was to re|turn to his regiment at length arrived, and the lovers were forced to feel the pangs of &s;eparation. In vain did Antoinette &s;olicit a di&s;pen&s;ation for the colonel, repre&s;enting to M. Mayenne how nece&s;&s;ary this officer was in her balls and promenades. He was obliged to depart, but madame de Gu&eacute;me|n&eacute;e &s;oon dried the tears of Antoinette; and &s;ome <HI>ladies of the camp</HI> as quickly con&s;oled M. Dillon.</P>
<P>About this time happened the death of Louis XV. &s;irnamed the Well-Beloved; and the hu&s;band of Antoinette &s;ucceeded to the throne of France, by the title of Louis XVI. Our heroine now found her&s;elf in
<PB N="27" REF="027308_0030_0FD3FE52C0CE8330">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that &s;overeignty, for which &s;he had waited, from the fir&s;t moment of her arrival in France, with the mo&s;t im|patient expectation. Regardle&s;s of deco|rum, &s;he made no effort to conceal the joy which &s;he felt at this event. The grateful tear of filial affection could not indeed have been expected to flow from the eyes of &s;uch a woman; but the <HI>appearance,</HI> at lea&s;t, of grief would have been a&s;&s;umed on this occa&s;ion, had &s;he not lo&s;t all re&s;pect for decency. But far from that, her balls and entertainments now became more gay, &s;uperb and frequent. The circle of her plea&s;ures was enlarged, and &s;he daily plunged into new exce&s;&s;es. The unparal|leled licence of her conduct excited the in|dignation of the virtuous, and it &s;candalized even the lea&s;t &s;crupulous. The prince&s;s de Mar&s;an, and madame de Maurepas, pre|&s;umed to repre&s;ent to Antoinette the im|propriety of &s;uch proceedings, and remon|&s;trated again&s;t them in &s;trong, though re|&s;pectful

terms. This however produced only ridicule and re&s;entment on the part of the queen.</P>

<P>IN 1775 the court went to Rheims, where the ceremony of the con&s;ecration of Louis XVI. was performed. Notwith&s;tanding the low &s;ituation of the finances, and the remon&s;trances of her hu&s;band, who preach|ed nothing but economy, Antoinette cau&s;ed the preparations for this journey to be of the mo&s;t expen&s;ive kind. The mo&s;t mag|nificent equipages, with per&s;onal ornaments the mo&s;t &s;uperb and co&s;tly, were provided by her direction. And as the public trea&s;ury was already too much exhau&s;ted to an&s;wer the&s;e enormities of expence, &s;he had re|cour&s;e
<PB N="29" REF="027308_0032_0FD3FE54B208CEB0">
to a number of u&s;urers, from whom very large &s;ums were obtained, by promi&s;es of mo&s;t extravagant gratuities from the pub|lic coffers, as &s;oon as they &s;hould be filled by monies extorted from the nation.</P>
<P>The evening previous to their departure, Louis, with tears of tenderne&s;s, pathetically exhorted Antoinette to a conduct which &s;hould contradict all that &s;candal which had been circulated in con&s;equence of her le|vities and mi&s;conduct. Ever prompt to di&s;|&s;emble, &s;he embraced him with pretended af|fection, and &s;olemnly declared &s;he would be guided by his coun&s;el. Her language ap|peared to be that of truth and &s;weetne&s;s; but her perfidious heart was full of fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>Behold our heroine now at Rheims, plung|ed into a &s;ea of licentiou&s;ne&s;s. On her ar|rival at this place, &s;he wholly &s;eparated her court from that of the king's, and rendered it a pantheon of plea&s;ure. Here prudi&s;h mo|de&s;ty found no admi&s;&s;ion; decency and
<PB N="30" REF="027308_0033_0FD3FE57EAAC31C0">
&s;obriety were con&s;idered as impertinents, and the fir&s;t in merit was the fir&s;t in vice. Feats of gallantry were the &s;plendid achieve|ments of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t emulous of glory; and the bu&s;ine&s;s of all was intrigue. Here Antoinette, in&s;tead of appearing like the augu&s;t queen of an amiable nation, be|came a Venus, in real life, &s;urrounded with her nymphs and votaries. Neither did &s;he forget that her hu&s;band was a Vulcan, and as &s;uch he was treated. The young due de Coigny was cho&s;en as her favorite Mars; and, if we except the circum&s;tance of the net, the whole of this poetic fable, even to the nudity of the happy couple, was realized.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of Antoinette and her court, during her re&s;idence at Rheims. Even that tran&s;parent veil, which &s;he had earle&s;sly thrown over her adulterous amours at Ver&s;ailles, was now laid a&s;ide; and the con&s;traint of &s;ecrecy was no longer con&s;i|dered as compatible with the dignity of royal wantonne&s;s. All regard for reputa|tion,
<PB N="31" REF="027308_0034_0FD3FE5A83C25760">
all apprehen&s;ion of publicity was now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and even her loo&s;e&s;t moments were &s;carce guarded from the general eye by the umbrage of privacy.</P>
<P><HI>L' I&s;le d' Amour,</HI> a &s;mall but delightful i&s;land, &s;ituated in the river near Rheims, was the favorite &s;cene of her anti-conjugal gambols. She indeed rendered it the re&s;i|dence of the deity who&s;e name it bears, and fixed unequivocal propriety to its appella|tion. It became, in fact, another Cyprus; and, as the pre&s;iding power was pre&s;ent to regulate her &s;acrifices, it may be well pre|&s;umed they were neither few nor &s;mall.</P>
<P>On the evening of the ninth of June, 1775, Antoinette gave a mo&s;t brilliant &s;up|per at this favorite I&s;le. The king received a &s;light invitation to this nocturnal fea&s;t, but as &s;he wi&s;hed and expected, he refu&s;ed to go. This infamous night was de&s;tined to voluptuous exce&s;&s;es, to which &s;he was ap|prehen&s;ive his pre&s;ence might have given
<PB N="32" REF="027308_0035_0FD3FE5CC0BEDF48">
&s;ome con&s;traint. From this banquet all ce|remony and etiquette were bani&s;hed; and every gue&s;t, of either &s;ex, followed the ex|ample of the queen, and drank like true Germans. Immediately after &s;upper the at|tendants were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and on a &s;ignal given by Antoinette, the lights were extin|gui&s;hed. All now wandered at hazard in the adjacent grove, in order to give, as chance might happen to pair them, a pro|mi&s;cuous con&s;ummation to the&s;e baccha|nalian orgies. Antoinette, who undoubted|ly &s;hould be recorded by the faithful hi&s;to|rian as the original inventor of this refined &s;pecies of revelry, was not di&s;appointed of that plea&s;ure which &s;he expected to derive from the execution of this ingenious pro|ject. By an artful addre&s;s, &s;he now ta&s;ted all the raptures of that &s;udden variety, the enjoyment of which &s;he had anticipated. The inexpre&s;&s;ible tran&s;ports of this night are known to have afforded her a &s;ource of delightful recollection, and to have long been
<PB N="33" REF="027308_0036_0FD3FE5DC0566148">
the favorite topic of her confidential con|ver&s;ations.</P>
<P>The king, although he did not &s;u&s;pect the infidelity of Antoinette, di&s;approved the&s;e nocturnal riots. The next day he &s;poke of her conduct as light and improper; and ended his &s;ermon, &s;o di&s;agreeable to her, by an expre&s;s interdiction of her vi&s;its to the I&s;le d' Amour. She complained of this tyranny, as &s;he termed it, of her royal &s;pou&s;e; but the &s;urly monarch was peremp|tory, and &s;he was obliged to yield obedi|ence.</P>
<P>The pompous ceremony of con&s;ecration being over, the court returned to Ver&s;ailles. The celebrated Montan&s;ier, who was a ma|nager of theatrical exhibitions in this city, being overwhelmed with debt, had at this time formed the plan of a fraudulent bank|ruptcy. This circum&s;tance being commu|nicated to the queen, &s;he undertook to patronize this retailer of licentious plea&s;ure.
<PB N="34" REF="027308_0037_0FD3FE5F39172490">
She extricated her from the labyrinth in which &s;he was involved, by paying all her debts; and &s;he even extended her bounty &s;o far as to enable la Montan&s;ier to continue her bu&s;ine&s;s. The lewd and indecent plays which were introduced to the public by this manager, were happily calculated to plea&s;e the ta&s;te of Antoinette; &s;he became a con&s;tant attendant on them. She, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, was u&s;ually accompanied by her a&s;&s;iduous brother-in-law, the count d'Artois. The king beheld the&s;e irregularities with painful anxiety; and often be&s;ought the queen, with tears in his eyes, to de&s;i&s;t from cour&s;es of life &s;o de&s;tructive to dome&s;tic felicity, and &s;o productive of public infamy. Find|ing every remon&s;trance ineffectual, he at length determined to enforce a reformation by different and more &s;pirited means.</P>
<P>One night Antoinette and d'Artois, re|turning from Trianon, as u&s;ual, at a very late hour, on pre&s;enting them&s;elves at the gate of the ca&s;tle, were refu&s;ed admittance

by the centinel. Enraged at this unexpect|ed detention, the count had recour&s;e to exe|crations and menaces, both of which proved equally ineffectual. The guard remained inflexible, alledging, in ju&s;tification of his conduct, that he had received his orders from the king's own mouth, and it was his duty and determination to execute them. Antoinette then di&s;covered her&s;elf, and in a tran&s;port of rage, demanded, <Q>if he dared to oppo&s;e the pa&s;&s;age of the queen?</Q> The &s;oldier an&s;wered, that orders had been given him indefinitely, and without exception, to &s;uffer no per&s;on whatever to enter the palace by that gate after a certain hour; and tho&s;e who &s;hould oppo&s;e his obedience to the&s;e orders, would do it at the peril of their lives. In fine, the illu&s;trious couple were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of returning to the theatre of Montan&s;ier, in order to avail them|&s;elves of a private pa&s;&s;age leading from thence to the palace. They were obliged even to &s;olicit a light from the &s;oldiers in the &s;alle-des-gardes. The next morning,
<PB N="36" REF="027308_0040_0FD3FE6858EC0140">
Antoinette complained bitterly to the king, of the unprecedented rudene&s;s with which &s;he had been treated by the audacious cen|tinel. The &s;urly monarch, &s;hrugging up his &s;houlders, replied, that he him&s;elf had given the guard his orders, not wi&s;hing his hou&s;e to be di&s;turbed by profligate revellers after he was in bed.</P>
<P>Antoinette &s;ighed for revenge on the au|thor of this mortifying and ridiculous ad|venture, and determined to avail her&s;elf of the &s;ure&s;t means of procuring it, by per&s;e|vering in her licentious exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>About this time the queen was declared to be pregnant; and this event gave birth to an infinite variety of opinions. The <HI>wi&s;e ones</HI> them&s;elves knew not with certainty where the &s;u&s;picion ought to be fixed; but mo&s;t circum&s;tances &s;eem to have united to point out the duke de Coigny as a parental agent in this affair. Her pregnancy was dated from a time when &s;he was known to have had an appointment with this <HI>healthy</HI> and
<PB N="37" REF="027308_0041_0FD3CFE020B250C8">
<HI>hand&s;ome</HI> young nobleman. At a certain ball &s;he had been &s;uddenly mi&s;&s;ed, and, as after|wards appeared, was about the &s;ame time &s;een to enter a retired apartment with him. The king, however, was the greate&s;t dupe. He indeed flattered him&s;elf that he was the father of the child, and congratulated him|&s;elf with rapturous delu&s;ion, on the expecta|tion of the offspring which was ha&s;tening to the world. The courtiers favored the deception, and applauded the fond credulity of this father in imagination. The delivery of the queen, when it arrived, was &s;low, painful, and dangerous. Vermont her ac|coucheur, however, &s;aved her life by a blood-letting, which he performed in con|tradiction to the opinion of other gentle|men of the faculty, who had been con&s;ulted on this occa&s;ion. Meantime her lovers, ap|prehen&s;ive that in this &s;tate of agony &s;he might make unfortunate di&s;coveries, were filled with the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. The duke de Coigny particularly, &s;hewed marks of the greate&s;t anxiety, and made, in his di&s;|tre&s;s,
<PB N="38" REF="027308_0042_0FD3FE69B5FDB760">
a &s;pectacle at once diverting and piti|able. The labor, however, at length ended happily; on which the king leaped about in an ec&s;ta&s;y of joy, pre&s;&s;ing the hand of Ver|mont, and calling him his guardian angel. In imitation of the example of Henry IV. he exhibited the infant to the a&s;&s;embly, with an air of inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction, and ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to M. d'Algire, pre&s;ident of the parliament, exclaimed, <Q>Behold this child, my dear friend, and acknowledge in it the &s;emblance of its father!</Q></P>

<P>WHEN the queen recovered from her illne&s;s, a different round of amu&s;ements was introduced at Ver&s;ailles. This con&s;i&s;ted of balls and promenades, particularly nocturnal ones. Every fine evening the court a&s;|&s;embled
<PB N="39" REF="027308_0043_0FD3FDE9EA2156E0">
on the terrace before the palace. Here per&s;ons of all ranks were collected; even the vile&s;t and lowe&s;t women of Ver|&s;ailles were not excluded. In the&s;e &s;cenes of riot, the actors were generally in ma&s;|querade. This &s;pecies of di&s;gui&s;e, with the &s;ecurity of night, often veiled tran&s;actions which might well retire from the beams of day, and with which the hi&s;torian declines to &s;tain his page. The <HI>gardes-fran&ccedil;ai&s;es,</HI> were, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, in&s;tructed to play airs, which being la&s;civiou&s;ly tender, were happily calculated to influence the loo&s;er pa&s;&s;ions. Biron, an officer in the gardes-du-corps, took particular pains to acquaint him|&s;elf with what pa&s;&s;ed at the&s;e meetings, and he afterwards took equal pains to make it public. It would be tedious to relate the various adventures of Antoinette during this &s;ummer.</P>
<P>The next that we &s;hall notice is her fa|mous one with a clerk of the &s;ecretary at war. He was natural &s;on to a certain coun|te&s;s,
<PB N="40" REF="027308_0044_0FD3FE6B4BB091A8">
who, if any credit be due to fame, would have found it difficult to a&s;certain his father. By her patronage he had ob|tained the place, which he now occupied under the &s;ecretary. The de&s;ires of the queen were no &s;ooner excited, than &s;he re|&s;olved on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> immediate gratification. In order to effect this, one Campan, a valet de chambre, to whom the office of the queen's confidential amba&s;&s;ador was not a new one, was ordered to introduce the clerk into her clo&s;et. Accu&s;tomed to tran&s;actions of this nature, this adroit procurer executed the orders of Antoinette with expedition and &s;ucce&s;s. An interview &s;oon took place; the clerk could not &s;ufficiently congratulate him&s;elf on this unexpected felicity, and An|toinette was but too happy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a lover, whom nature &s;eemed to have en|dowed with abilities &s;uited to her de&s;ires. When the unthinking ec&s;ta&s;y of their fir&s;t interviews gave way to reflection, it occur|red to the queen, that by the frequent vi&s;its of this favorite &s;crivener to her apartment,
<PB N="41" REF="027308_0045_0FD3FE6CC33939D0">
&s;u&s;picions might be exolted, equally fatal to him and to her. On this occa&s;ion, &s;he had immediate recour&s;e to the advice of her pri|vy-coun&s;ellor Campan; and the following artifice was finally determined to be put in practice. The clerk was to be furni&s;hed from time to time with pieces of mu&s;ic, under a pretext of copying which for the queen, he made her frequent and un&s;u&s;pect|ed vi&s;its. By this ingenious contrivance, the happy couple continued their clande&s;|tine meetings, for &s;ome length of time, in &s;ecurity; but, by &s;ome accident, the count d'Artois was at length led to &s;u&s;pect their connection, and accu&s;ed the queen of it. It might be imagined, that on this occa|&s;ion &s;he would have had recour&s;e to tho&s;e acts of deception, in which &s;he had ac|quired an unrivalled proficiency. But far from that, &s;he frankly acknowledged her extravagant fondne&s;s for this hand&s;ome Hercules; believing her gallant brother-in-law too liberal in his &s;entiments to cen&s;ure her with &s;everity. She, at the &s;ame time,
<PB N="42" REF="027308_0046_0FD3FE6E489C8B48">
expre&s;&s;ed her apprehen&s;ions that the amour might be di&s;covered by the king, and reque&s;ted the advice of <HI>fraternal friend&s;hip,</HI> concerning its future management. D'Ar|tois wholly di&s;approved the connection, and in&s;i&s;ted on her never &s;eeing the clerk again. Such was her &s;ituation with the count at this time, that &s;he found her&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;enting to a &s;trict compliance with his wi&s;hes. She therefore declared &s;he would be entirely guided by his coun&s;el, and de&s;ired him to di&s;po&s;e of the young man at his own plea&s;ure. The count was plea&s;|ed with this commi&s;&s;ion, which he executed but too faithfully. In a few days afterwards the clerk was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated on the road which leads from Paris to Ver&s;ailles.</P>

<P>THE winter which followed this adven|ture was, like the preceding, &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of licentious di&s;&s;ipation. It was, however, if po&s;&s;ible, more luxurious and expen&s;ive. La Bertin and Guimard were now preferred to the honourable place of the queen's private mini&s;tre&s;&s;es. La Ber|tin was a <HI>milliner,</HI> and Guimard an <HI>opera girl.</HI> Of all the celebrated prie&s;te&s;&s;es of Ve|nus, never were any more deeply ver&s;ed in her arts and my&s;teries than the&s;e. Having practi&s;ed with unremitting a&s;&s;iduity from early life, they had now attained to almo&s;t unrivalled eminence. Antoinette, ever the patrone&s;s of this &s;pecies of merit, determin|ed to reward that abundance of it which &s;he di&s;covered in this <HI>virtuous couple.</HI> It appeared to her a kind of inju&s;tice, that ta|lents
<PB N="44" REF="027308_0048_0FD3FE74F7CA7C68">
worthy to be &s;ub&s;ervient only to royal luxury, &s;hould be pro&s;tituted to plebeian plea&s;ure. She therefore rai&s;ed them to the rank of her confidential friends. Happy had it been for France, had Louis XVI. di&s;covered as much &s;agacity as Antoinette in the choice of his mini&s;ters. Sully, Col|bert, and Richlieu, for management and fi|ne&s;&s;e, were &s;carce to be compared with La Bertin and Guimard. While the amours of the queen were under the direction of the&s;e machiavelian females, they were veiled from the public eye with the mo&s;t artful &s;ecrecy. It cannot therefore be expected, that we &s;hould give a particular account of them.</P>
<P>So capricious however was Antoinette, that even the mo&s;t important &s;ervices could not long &s;ecure her favour. She &s;oon grew tired of practi&s;ing what &s;he termed the ti|mid caution of La Bertin and Guimard. Impatient of the re&s;traints of that &s;ecrecy to which they advi&s;ed, &s;he gradually cooled

in her friend&s;hip towards them, and at length di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them from her &s;ervice.</P>
<P>About this time, Madame Jules de Polig|nac was brought to bed. The court, on this occa&s;ion, pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal days in revelry and rejoicings. The queen was &s;uppo&s;ed to pay the utmo&s;t attention to her friend la Polig|nac, to keep continually at her bed-&s;ide, and to become, in fact, her nur&s;e. She was lodged in an apartment of Vaudreuil, at Pa|ris. Tho&s;e who were unacquainted with the intrigues of court, thought it very &s;ingu|lar, that la Polignac had not been lodged in the palace of Ver&s;ailles, which would have appeared at once more natural and decent. Let &s;uch be informed, that it was infinitely more convenient that &s;he &s;hould be with Vaudreuil. The daily vi&s;its of the queen to Paris were owing to other motives than tho&s;e of female friend&s;hip. Madame la Polignac had been familiar with Van|dreuil, and &s;he had become the mother of a <HI>&s;on.</HI> La Polignac was however u&s;ed with
<PB N="46" REF="027308_0050_0FD3FE7A56DDFD18">
tenderne&s;s and genero&s;ity. The queen made her a pre&s;ent of a box of jewels, va|lued at 80,000 livres, and the king, influ|enced by her example, forgot his u&s;ual par|&s;imony, and gave her an equal &s;um in &s;ilver. She was al&s;o pre&s;ented with the duchy of Mayenne, worth the <HI>trifling &s;um</HI> of 1,400,000 livres. To this la&s;t piece of liberality Mr. Neckar pre&s;umed to make &s;ome oppo&s;ition. But he found this only gave di&s;plea&s;ure, and recollecting the fall of Mr. Turgot, he pru|dently determined to comply with the royal whim of the moment. He therefore only advi&s;ed that in&s;tead of the duchy in que&s;tion, the lady &s;hould be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of nearly its value in ready money. This propo&s;al, being &s;atisfactory to the parties concerned, was immediately put in execution.</P>
<P>Meantime the very frequent pa&s;&s;ings and repa&s;&s;ings of the queen from Ver&s;ailles to Paris which had taken place, gave much unea&s;ine&s;s to the Pari&s;ians. Accu&s;tomed to re&s;pect the decency of maje&s;ty, and to view

with awe the &s;plendor of &s;overeignty, they could not contemplate without indignation &s;uch &s;hameful degradations of royalty, and &s;uch a wa&s;te of favors on one &s;o unde&s;erving. La Polignac became more than ever the ob|ject of public hatred. The &s;candalous pro|fu&s;ion with which the national trea&s;ury had been poured into her lap, could not but ex|cite the anger of tho&s;e from whom it had been previou&s;ly extorted for very different purpo&s;es. The queen was &s;urrounded by the family of this favorite, and &s;he had loaded all its members with innumerable favors. The a&s;cendency which la Polig|nac now acquired is at once &s;urpri&s;ing and incredible. A few weeks after the birth of her child &s;he was attacked by a dangerous in|di&s;po&s;ition, on which occa&s;ion the queen di&s;|covered the utmo&s;t concern, and cau&s;ed &s;ome apartments near her own to be prepared in the mo&s;t elegant and expen&s;ive manner for the accommodation of la Polignac. She was immediately removed thither, and till &s;he recovered none could have acce&s;s to her ex|cept

<HI>Vaudreuil and the queen.</HI> On the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of her health, it was thought highly convenient, that &s;he &s;hould &s;till con|tinue to occupy tho&s;e apartments. Here was found as convenient a rendezvous as could be wi&s;hed, for the meetings of the queen and her privy council. Here they a&s;&s;embled to debate on the mo&s;t important points of policy.

<P>Vaudreuil and Be&s;enval, and &s;ome other men, were admitted to the&s;e conferences. Madame Jules de Polignac, Madame de Grammont, and Madame De&s;maine were three principal female members; the latter of whom acted the part of <HI>mini&s;ter of foreign affairs.</HI></P>

<P>WE begin with Vaudreuil. Vaudreuil inherited nothing from his father, who was a good man, but his name. He had been commandant of St. Domingo. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an ambitious and intriguing di&s;po&s;ition, but, at the &s;ame time, neither &s;agacious nor ac|tive, he courted fortune long in vain. He, at length, grew weary of the fruitle&s;s pur|&s;uit, entirely neglected bu&s;ine&s;s, and gave him&s;elf up to plea&s;ure. Fortune, as if &s;often|ed by neglect, now loaded him with favours, and placed him high in preferment. He
<PB N="51" REF="027308_0055_0FD3FE85B31679D8">
was introduced at court by a gentleman of the Helvetic cantons, not unknown in the catalogue of royal favors.</P>
<P>Be&s;enval was one of tho&s;e, who&s;e minds are always governed by the circum&s;tances of the moment. Incapable of permanent ideas, or exten&s;ive views, he varied with every va|riation of affairs, and traver&s;ed to every puff of air. Ambitious, in&s;en&s;ible, and vain, the meane&s;t of &s;ycophants, and the mo&s;t un|blu&s;hing of hypocrites, he de&s;erted entirely the urbanity of his fellow-citizens, to prac|tize knavery in courts. It is this Be&s;enval, who, with unparalleled effrontery, pre|&s;umed to put his merit in competition with that of the virtuous veteran d'Affry, who&s;e place had excited his envy. Although his ambition was in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;ap|pointed, yet he &s;ucceeded &s;o far as to pro|cure d'Affry, through the compte d'Artois, a multitude of mortifications, which the hone&s;t old &s;oldier felt the more &s;en&s;ibly, from his being con&s;cious that he did not me|rit

them; and, at the &s;ame time, being unable either to repul&s;e or revenge them. They were inflicted by the authority of the queen, and by the hand of d'Artois.</P>
<P>Dillon, Coigny, and Vermont, whom we have before mentioned, had a voice in their councils. The illu&s;trious Campan was al&s;o admitted; and he was indeed an important member, although &s;u&s;pected to be the &s;on of a footman, of the hou&s;e of Ventadour, of which even him&s;elf had once the honor of wearing the livery. This hero, &s;o worthy the favor of a great prince&s;s, was the <HI>per|petual &s;ecretary</HI> of this honorable committee. To this &s;econd <HI>Bonneau,</HI> who was indeed more artful than the fir&s;t, the queen owed the new invention of giving her orders, and managing her a&s;&s;ignations, by mu&s;ic. This contrivance was con&s;idered by its author, as a chef d'oeuvre. It was this chevalier of the order of St. Lazarus, who u&s;ed to carry mu&s;ic to be copied, to wait an an&s;wer at the
<PB N="53" REF="027308_0057_0FD3FE8878CAF4A8">
&s;tair-ca&s;e head, introduce the copyi&s;t, and guard the door.</P>
<P>At length, &s;ome matters which had been agitated in this cabinet, by chance, took air. This was wholly attributed to Madame de Chatillon, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have placed an improper confidence in the marquis d'En|tragues, with whom &s;he had been <HI>familiar|ly</HI> acquainted at Be&s;en&ccedil;on. This cunning courtier had determined never to di&s;cover this intrigue; but &s;ome things which had accidentally e&s;caped him, had excited &s;u&s;picions in the bo&s;om of his friend the prince de Montbarry. This mini&s;ter, who had long &s;hewed his di&s;plea&s;ure at the licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s of the queen, and the treacheries of the compte d'Artois, was now hated by the courtiers of both parties. He had taken the liberty of critici&s;ing with &s;everity the mini&s;|terial mea&s;ures of Maurepas, and his <HI>private</HI> life was examined with as little ceremony as his public.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE queen was now a &s;econd time declared pregnant. This event was di&s;clo&s;|ed in a manner &s;urpri&s;ingly &s;ingular. The queen cordially dete&s;ted M. de Maurepas; nor was &s;he fonder of the ancient counte&s;s, his wife, or their relations, the abb&eacute; de Verry, and madame Seguin. Not ignorant of this circum&s;tance, the antique couple conducted them&s;elves accordingly, aiming at that neutral tenor of conduct which neither &s;olicited the friend&s;hip of the queen, nor furni&s;hed her with a pretence for anger. At the moment when the breach was ima|gined to be wider than ever, Antoinette went to the hou&s;e of the count, and cau&s;ed her&s;elf to be announced. <Q>Good morning, papa, cried &s;he, on &s;eeing the count, you are undoubtedly a&s;toni&s;hed at this
<PB N="55" REF="027308_0059_0FD3FE8B722A9EF0">
vi&s;it, but I flatter my&s;elf that when we part you will not be di&s;&s;atisfied with it.</Q></P>
<P>Madame de Maurepas, who was in the apartment, now aro&s;e to withdraw, that &s;he might not incommode the bu&s;ine&s;s of that private interview with her hu&s;band, which appeared to be the object of this vi&s;it. The queen, perceiving her intention, prevented her departure. "My dear counte&s;s," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>you mu&s;t not leave me. I have need of your friend&s;hip as well as that of your worthy hu&s;band. The &s;ecret which I am about to confide to him, mu&s;t al&s;o be entru&s;ted to you. I mu&s;t on this occa&s;ion &s;olicit you both to become my parents, protectors and coun&s;ellors. But before we proceed to my affairs, let us begin by con&s;igning our pa&s;t animo&s;ities to eternal oblivion, and uniting our&s;elves in the firme&s;t bonds of amity. I mu&s;t frankly acknowlege, that I have &s;ometimes con|ducted my&s;elf unworthily towards you; but this was wholly owing to the di&s;ad|vantageous
<PB N="56" REF="027308_0060_0FD3FF3CB3DC2F20">
impre&s;&s;ions concerning you which were forced on my mind by your unprincipled enemies. Here you behold the only origin of that unmerited indif|ference, with which I have &s;ometimes treated you. Had, I known you better, I had e&s;teemed you more, I am now un|deceived, and I &s;hall confide to you, with|out re&s;erve, the mo&s;t important of &s;ecrets.</Q></P>
<P>"Know then," continued &s;he, <Q>I am pregnant! . . . . You appear to be rejoiced at this event, but it fills my bo&s;om with anxiety and alarm. I mu&s;t explain my|&s;elf; it is painful to be explicit; but your goodne&s;s encourages me, and I will pro|ceed without re&s;erve.&mdash;The king, mi&s;|tru&s;tful of his own impotence, has con|ceived unhappy &s;u&s;picions concerning this event. The&s;e &s;u&s;picions have been &s;trengthened and increa&s;ed by the cau&s;tic raillery of Mon&s;ieur and Madame, who have not &s;pared their royal brother on this occa&s;ion. My hu&s;band, my infant, and
<PB N="57" REF="027308_0061_0FD3FE91442416D0">
my&s;elf have been handled with equal &s;e|verity by their unmerciful wit. The counte&s;s d'Artois is al&s;o my enemy; and her &s;tupid clamours may do me much in|jury. But I may &s;et all their malice at defiance, if you are my friends; let me believe this, and my tortured bo&s;om will recover its former tranquillity. If you prove inflexible, and remain unmoved at my di&s;tre&s;s, I am lo&s;t forever!</Q></P>
<P>Ver&s;ed in all the arts of di&s;&s;imulation, and acquainted with every avenue to the heart, Antoinette, as &s;he uttered the&s;e la&s;t words, affected to faint, and &s;unk apparently in&s;en|&s;ible from her chair. This completed her victory. The count and his wife ran about the apartment like di&s;tracted per&s;ons, and recovered not the u&s;e of their rea&s;on till the queen was <HI>re&s;tored to life</HI> by the attendants, who had ru&s;hed in, on being alarmed by the cries of this pair of reverend dupes. The attendants were then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the count and counte&s;s, drowned in tears, threw
<PB N="58" REF="027308_0062_0FD3FE9329937A78">
them&s;elves at the feet of the queen, declar|ing that they were entirely at her devotion, and &s;wearing eternal fidelity.</P>
<P>After the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, and not till then, Antoinette came entirely to her&s;elf; and without quitting that melting modulation of voice, which &s;he had a&s;&s;umed in the former part of her narration, &s;he thus continued it with all the pathos of di&s;&s;embled grief.</P>
<P><Q>Believe me, my friends, I am the inno|cent victim of the fal&s;ehood of others, and my own credulity. I am betrayed by the perfidious coun&s;els of the artful Be&s;enval. He in&s;inuated that the people of France were &s;candalized at my levity, and di&s;&s;a|tisfied with my &s;terility. He then inti|mated that the only means of recovering their re&s;pect and conciliating their af|fection, was, to pre&s;ent the people with a prince, and the throne with a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. I at fir&s;t imagined the&s;e repre&s;entations de&s;|titute of foundation; but he cau&s;ed Vau|dreuil
<PB N="59" REF="027308_0063_0FD3FE9485341B88">
and Coigny, to whom he knew I &s;ometimes entru&s;ted my dome&s;tic chag|rins, to rea&s;on with me in the &s;ame man|ner. They never approached me without repre&s;enting my hu&s;band and my people di&s;plea&s;ed that I had you borne no &s;on. They painted to my view in colors the mo&s;t alarming, the humility of divorce, and the horrors of pro&s;cription. I was at length overcome. But, con&s;cious as I was of the inefficacy of conjugal endearments, I found my&s;elf compelled to have recour&s;e to infidelity. I was not led to the com|mi&s;&s;ion of this error by wantonne&s;s; but driven, as I imagined, by nece&s;&s;ity. It was therefore a mi&s;take of the judgment, not a crime of the heart. Your goodne&s;s will deem me not wholly inexcu&s;able, al|though I have been betrayed into a mo|mentary weakne&s;s. I have thus frankly told you the origin of my pre&s;ent &s;ituation You alone can repre&s;ent it in a proper light to the king; you alone can pre&s;erve me from ruin!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="027308_0064_0FD3FE9604A4A8E0"><Q>Ble&s;&s;ed be thy offspring, illu&s;trious prince&s;s! exclaimed the counte&s;s, all &s;hall be well.

<P>Marie Antoinette was too cunning not to &s;eize on this moment of enthu&s;ia&s;m. Fall|ing on the neck of the counte&s;s, &s;he embrac|ed her with tears of gratitude, and in&s;i&s;ted on her coming with the count her hu&s;band, to &s;up with her at court that evening, when the count might have an opportunity of ex|ecuting with the king tho&s;e friendly offices which he had promi&s;ed in her favor. They accepted the invitation, and appeared at
<PB N="61" REF="027308_0065_0FD3FE9776E49108">
court accordingly. During &s;upper they were treated with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing atten|tions, and the warme&s;t marks of reconcilia|tion and e&s;teem. To the courtiers this un|expected event was an a&s;toni&s;hing and in|&s;crutible paradox. All were ignorant of its cau&s;e, and the pre&s;umptions formed con|cerning it, were all wide from reality.</P>
<P>When the re&s;t of the court retired, the count remained with the king; and after a mo&s;t artful preface, for the fabrica|tion of which he was well qualified, an|nounced the pregnancy of the queen. At fir&s;t a frown appeared on the monarch's brow; but the per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence of Maurepas di&s;&s;ipated the gathering &s;torm, and at length prevailed on him to believe he had a &s;econd time become a parent. In or|der to account for the conduct of Marie An|toinette on this occa&s;ion, it is nece&s;&s;ary to inform the reader, that Louis had been led to entertain &s;u&s;picions concerning her former pregnancy, which &s;he had found
<PB N="62" REF="027308_0066_0FD3FE99040C8790">
it difficult to obviate. Langui&s;hing with her own un&s;atisfied de&s;ires, and enraged by the provoking temperance of her hu&s;band's pa&s;&s;ions, &s;he had often reproached him with want of &s;en&s;ibility, and intimated her con|viction of his impotence. He had been an eye witne&s;s to much of the levity of her con|duct: and the bu&s;y crowd by which he was &s;urrounded had often filled his ears with in|&s;inuations, that her career of licentiou&s;ne&s;s had not &s;topped &s;hort of the extreme of infi|delity. The &s;cruples cau&s;ed by the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances were, however, at length over|come by the artful Maurepas.</P>
<P>The day &s;ucceeding this farce, the court a&s;&s;umed a new appearance. The credulous monarch publicly declared the joyful news, nor did he attempt to conceal the tran&s;ports with which it in&s;pired him. He no longer &s;aluted the gallants of his wife, with the ma|lignant glances of &s;ilent jealou&s;y; but in the fulne&s;s of his heart embraced all he met,
<PB N="63" REF="027308_0067_0FD3FE9A7A2EDA08">
proclaiming, in a voice of ec&s;ta&s;y, the glad tidings.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trian heroine, being delivered from all her fears, pur&s;ued her ordinary round of licentiou&s;ne&s;s with increa&s;ed ardor. Wholly ab&s;orbed in his delightful dream of paternity, the monarch no longer viewed her conduct with &s;u&s;picious vigilance; he was, be&s;ides, too grateful to offer the authore&s;s of his felicity the unkindne&s;s of con&s;traint. He cea&s;ed to li&s;ten to the in&s;inuations of the enemies of Antoinette, and regarded their repre&s;entations again&s;t her as the offspring of fal&s;ehood and calumny. That &s;trong aver|&s;ion with which all men turn from the idea of a deficient virility, &s;trengthened his cre|dulity, and &s;hut his ears again&s;t conviction. On all tho&s;e glaring facts, which, armed in all the energy of demon&s;tration, from time to time, &s;tood forth to encounter his delu&s;ion, he ob&s;tinately clo&s;ed his eyes.</P>

<P>THE pregnancy of the queen meantime advanced, which was not, however, ac|cording to the etiquette of court, declared in the fifth month, on account of the &s;arca&s;ms which it was apprehended this event might produce.

<P>The wicked coun&s;els which had been given her by Jo&s;eph II. on her departure from the German court, &s;he kept con&s;tant|ly in mind. But, to render their execution practicable, it was nece&s;&s;ary to remove a mini&s;ter who had always been declared her enemy.</P>

<P>CHARLES Philip d'Artois had, for &s;ome time, behaved with unu&s;ual coolne&s;s to his &s;i&s;ter-in-law. His pa&s;&s;ion for her be|came weakened by her intrigues. It was not till fear removed her other lovers that

he re&s;umed his place. Impelled by the mo&s;t alarming apprehen&s;ions of di&s;covery, they had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively for&s;aken her; while &s;he in vain employed wanton looks, and expre&s;&s;ive touches, to prevent their departure. Their ardor having abated, they &s;hrunk away with horror, at the idea of being caught in the arms of the queen. She therefore clung to her brother-in-law, who, le&s;s fearful of the dangers of the connection, &s;upplied the place of Coigny, Dillon, Vaudreuil, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>wife</HI> pretended, that of this return of tenderne&s;s the Dauphin was the offspring. And this &s;u&s;picion was even circulated in the ballads of the day.</P>
<P>The voluptuous d'Artois, a man of little refinement in his plea&s;ures, was intimately connected with the duc de Chartres, then Philip Capet, or d'Orleans. They col|lected in their travels nothing except an ample &s;tock of vices and follies. Engli&s;h cu&s;toms, manners, and fa&s;hions made &s;uch

an impre&s;&s;ion on the frivolous minds of the&s;e <HI>opera-knights</HI> of <HI>&s;candalous adventures,</HI> that, when they returned to France, they made it their only bu&s;ine&s;s to ape the manners of the people of Great Britain. The courtiers, tho&s;e vile &s;ycophants, in their turn, copied d'Artois and de Chartres: and, in a &s;hort time, all became <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the court and in the city; the king, and the egoti&s;t, Stani&s;laus-Xavier, only excepted.</P>
<P>Every day, new races at Vincennes, on the plain of Sablons, added a new varni&s;h to the follies of the&s;e princes. The French people, who&s;e morality is plea&s;ure, flocked in multitudes to the&s;e diver&s;ions, as if they went there to be &s;pectators of &s;ome import|ant event: even mechanics univer&s;ally de|&s;erted their &s;hops, to behold the ridiculous &s;pectacle of princes dre&s;&s;ed like Engli&s;h grooms. On the vigor and intrepidity of the&s;e valiant <HI>Jockies</HI> hung the fate of for|tunes! The&s;e two unworthy branches of the blood of the Bourbons acquired as much

<P>Habited like an Amazon, and mounted on a &s;uperb palfry, Marie Antoinette &s;how|ed her&s;elf the friend of their plea&s;ures, be|cau&s;e they favored her own.

At fir&s;t, however, he refu&s;ed to bet; but &s;eeming at length to yield to the importunity of the queen, he an&s;wered her, with that &s;implicity which characteri&s;ed him, and an unmeaning &s;mile, <Q>Is it your wi&s;h?

<P>When the races were &s;carce fini&s;hed, An|toinette u&s;ed to depart, like a fla&s;h, for Trianon, where &s;he did not long wait to be joined by her voluptuous brother-in-law; and the&s;e clande&s;tine interviews u&s;ually ter|minated in the mo&s;t luxurious exce&s;&s;es.

<P>It will be imagined from the good under|&s;tanding which now reigned between the&s;e illu&s;trious and ince&s;tuous lovers, that Charles Philip occupied all the thoughts of his &s;i&s;ter-in-law. But con&s;tancy was not the favorite virtue of the queen of France.</P>

<P>THE hand&s;ome <HI>Fer&s;enne,</HI> a colonel in the regiment of Royal Swedes, was now the happy man. He had long been enamoured of the queen, and &s;he had rewarded his earlie&s;t advances with &s;uch tender and ex|pre&s;&s;ive glances, that he was convinced he was not to langui&s;h a long time for the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the object of his de&s;ires.</P>

<P>I HAVE for &s;ome time ob&s;erved that you frequent the parterres, of which I am mi&s;tre&s;s; and regard with attention the flowers which are under my dominion. What are your de&s;igns, and what are your wi&s;hes? You have excited my &s;u&s;|picions; and I am alarmed for the &s;afety of my flowers.

<P>The queen did not wait long for an an|&s;wer. The box was returned by the &s;ame po&s;t. On opening it, the queen found the following.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>ZEPHYR TO FLORA.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with indifference that Zephyr views the flowers of Flora; when he vi&s;its her parterres, it is in hopes of find|ing their queen, and it is her alone he wi&s;hes to behold. Yet, when he is in her pre&s;ence, his mouth is clo&s;ed with re&s;pect, and his eyes are the &s;ilent interpreters of his heart.</P>
<P>This evening at nine, love and gra|titude will carry Zephyr to <HI>Trianon.</HI> Then will he &s;trive to bani&s;h the inquietude

of Flora, and to convince her of the &s;in|cerity of his profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Punctual to the moment, <HI>Fer&s;enne</HI> was introduced to an apartment in which Antoi|nette already waited his arrival with the mo&s;t lively impatience. Her intimate con|fidant, Bazin, was the <HI>Mercury</HI> of this inter|view. This vile and cringing valet was accu&s;tomed to this office. Little did he think him&s;elf di&s;graced by the title of <HI>pimp,</HI> provided it were to an illu&s;trious per&s;onage.</P>
<P>From this period their interviews be|came frequent, and continued for a length of time, which exceeded the u&s;ual duration of the amours of Antoinette. Her ta&s;te for change, however, returned, and &s;he &s;ighed for a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the exhau&s;ted Fer&s;enne.</P>
<P>She was he&s;itating on whom to be&s;tow this place, when the counte&s;s <HI>Valois de la Motte</HI> was pre&s;ented to the queen by <HI>la Mi|&s;ery,</HI> her fir&s;t <HI>femme de chambre.</HI> This un|fortunate
<PB N="78" REF="027308_0083_0FD3FEBD09F75C70">
counte&s;s appeared at court, to &s;olicit the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the territory of Fon|t&eacute;t&eacute;, which had been enjoyed by her ance&s;|tors.</P>
<P>Antoinette affected to patroni&s;e her de|mand, guided, as &s;he pretended, by a prin|ciple of equity. It was, however, with a view of acquiring a claim to her gratitude, that Antoinette intere&s;ted her&s;elf in this affair. She therefore u&s;ed her influence with Colonne, to obtain a trifling augmen|tation of the pen&s;ion, which the counte&s;s already received from the court. By the addition of 700 livers to the 800, which had before been granted to enable her to &s;up|port with proper dignity the name of Valois, the queen hoped to accompli&s;h her de&s;igns.</P>
<P>The cardinal de Rohan had not yet re|nounced the projects which his pa&s;&s;ion for Antoinette had formerly in&s;pired. He &s;till watched all her movements, and intercept|ed all her looks. He early di&s;covered her
<PB N="79" REF="027308_0084_0FD3FEBEAE1EA018">
intentions re&s;pecting la Motte, before they were even &s;u&s;pected by the latter. This he immediately communicated to the coun|te&s;s, hoping, by this office of apparent friend|&s;hip, to render her &s;ub&s;ervient to his views.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of this affair, Antoinette was in&s;en&s;ibly conducted towards that ven|geance which &s;he had long &s;ecretly me|ditated again&s;t the cardinal. But his de|&s;truction did not prove &s;o complete as &s;he wi&s;hed it to have been. A &s;caffold was the fate which her humanity intended him.</P>
<P>The collar on which the queen had &s;o pertinaciou&s;ly fixed her affections, was at length obtained. <HI>Lexclaux,</HI> her &s;ecret me&s;|&s;enger, was charged with its delivery. She received it with tran&s;port; and, in that moment, &s;wore to make it the in&s;trument of the cardinal's ruin. It was not her in|tention to have involved the counte&s;s de la Motte in tho&s;e misfortunes which afterwards overwhelmed her. The&s;e were produced
<PB N="80" REF="027308_0085_0FD3FEC2D2A23F98">
by an unfor&s;een concurrence of circum|&s;tances. Concerning this event, there were, in Paris, almo&s;t as many opinions as per|&s;ons.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to repre&s;ent in their true colours, all the horrors which were produced by this wicked action of Antoinette. One of its effects, however, (dreadful as it is) mu&s;t not be omitted. In con&s;equence of this affair, the two &s;houlders of the counte&s;s de la Motte were marked and branded with four &s;candalous lines of ver&s;e, (with which we &s;hall not di&s;grace our page) on the 10th of July, 1786, by virtue of a decree of the parliament.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary, in order to complete the purpo&s;e of Marie Antoinette, that the&s;e diamonds &s;hould be entirely at her own di&s;|po&s;al; and this was, in a &s;hort time ef|fected. The benefactions which &s;he was now enabled to be&s;tow on her favorites appeared the more generous, becau&s;e they
<PB N="81" REF="027308_0086_0FD3FEC591E2A8B8">
were valuable; and they were conferred with a better grace, as they co&s;t her no|thing.</P>
<P>By the&s;e benefactions was the unfortu|nate counte&s;s de la Motte afterwards con|ducted to an infamous po&s;t, to &s;uffer that unde&s;erved mark of ignominy which &s;he received from the hand of a public execu|tioner.</P>
<P>The nice&s;t artifice, and the mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite hypocri&s;y, were now nece&s;&s;ary to ex|tricate our heroine from a &s;ituation &s;o cri|tical. Had the ba&s;ene&s;s of her conduct been di&s;covered, &s;he would have been covered with &s;hame and infamy. But on this oc|ca&s;ion, governed by her ordinary principles, &s;he made a &s;acrifice of innocence, to add a few moments to the exi&s;tence of her already expiring honor. She therefore availed her|&s;elf of every precaution, and folded her atrocity in the mo&s;t impenetrable veil that
<PB N="82" REF="027308_0087_0FD3FEC6D91DB000">
the mo&s;t unprincipled and artful of minds could form.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious that the &s;malle&s;t degree of con|fidence on this &s;ubject might prove de&s;truc|tive, the queen conducted her&s;elf with the &s;tricte&s;t re&s;erve. In vain did the crafty and &s;agacious baron de Breteuil endeavor to draw from her the &s;ecret, by confident demands, or by in&s;idious inquiries. With un&s;haken firmne&s;s &s;he per&s;evered in denying that this toy had ever been in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. She uniformly a&s;&s;erted that &s;he knew as little of the matter as la Motte. The&s;e declarations &s;he continued to repeat, till la Motte was lo&s;t!</P>
<P>The queen thus e&s;caped a proce&s;s, the whole infamy of which was due to her alone. Her name was no longer mentioned but as having been abu&s;ed; and an univer&s;al in|dignation was expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e &s;up|po&s;ed impo&s;tors, who had dared to defame

their &s;overeign, in hopes to &s;creen their guilty heads from ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>A &s;entence, which violated every prin|ciple of law and equity, was now pro|nounced, and innocence was its victim.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;ilence which was enjoined with regard to this affair by the mi|ni&s;terial inqui&s;ition, the queen was not the le&s;s defamed in the <HI>opinion</HI> of the public. She, however, lo&s;t nothing of her &s;ecurity. She &s;till kept in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion three hundred and fifty-&s;ix diamonds, of the collar which &s;he had &s;o hand&s;omely obtained; and from which &s;he &s;till hoped one day to di&s;play a &s;et of bracelets &s;imilar to tho&s;e worn by the queen of England. The tricks and in|trigues of the count de Vergennes, in the cour&s;e of this iniquitous affair, taught the queen how nece&s;&s;ary it was to beware of him. And, as crimes co&s;t her nothing, &s;he now meditated one again&s;t him, the exe|cution of which &s;oon followed.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="027308_0090_0FD3FECF47E68988">The ill &s;ucce&s;s of the emperor's own af|fairs, together with the turn which the affair of the collar had taken in France, had now rendered him incon&s;olable. All his projects were now di&s;appointed. Although he had before received a &s;ufficient number of proofs of the wickedne&s;s of his &s;i&s;ter, and of the imbecility of the cardinal de Ro|han; yet his fal&s;e policy had per&s;uaded him that his ambition might be &s;atisfied, and his views fulfilled by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this mini&s;ter, who would not have he&s;itated to &s;econd that confu&s;ion in the &s;tate which the emperor meditated, and of which he knew how to profit.</P>
<P>Mean time the mind of Antoinette was wholly occupied by the mo&s;t execrable of de&s;igns; and anticipated the glory to be acquired by its execution. One of her enemies was however yet alive. Plans were formed to bring about his expul&s;ion from court. Accu&s;ations, founded in truth, were in vain &s;ought for, to occa&s;ion his
<PB N="85" REF="027308_0091_0FD3FED15511A958">
bani&s;hment; and the efforts of calumny &s;erved only to brighten his triumph.</P>
<P>She had in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the famous re|ceipt of Catharine de Medicis. The aged Maurepas had fallen a victim to its fatal effects; even in the moment, when the queen profe&s;&s;ed a &s;incere reconciliation, and &s;wore to receive his advi&s;e ever after with the highe&s;t deference. But &s;he embraced only that &s;he might &s;trangle. She deter|mined to be&s;tow on Vergennes a &s;imilar do&s;e; and the execrable Polignac was fixed on as her a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the commi&s;&s;ion of this crime. For this purpo&s;e, a reconciliation with this infamous woman became nece&s;&s;ary. This the artful Antoinette effected without difficulty. The fatal poi&s;on was artfully prepared, and &s;peedily given. The count de Vergennes was &s;eized with a mortal languor, and &s;oon expired.</P>
<P>The reconciliation between the queen and Polignac furni&s;hed matter for much
<PB N="86" REF="027308_0092_0FD3FED3153C1C88">
&s;lander. The infamous attachment of An|toinette became the &s;ubject of public conver|&s;ation and univer&s;al cen&s;ure. But &s;he laugh|ed at &s;arca&s;m, and li&s;tened to her own infamy without blu&s;hing.</P>
<P>The emperor &s;till nouri&s;hed the hope of effecting an inte&s;tine divi&s;ion in France. He communicated his projects to his &s;i&s;ter; and &s;he &s;econded them with all her influence.</P>
<P>Jules de Polignac became the favorite of Antoinette, and the &s;oul of all her plea|&s;ures. They were now in&s;eparable com|panions, and all the moments which the queen could &s;natch from the company of Louis were devoted to this libidinous duch|e&s;s. She puni&s;hed the indolence of the king by the mo&s;t abominable commerce, which &s;he now &s;carce took pains to conceal from him.</P>
<P>Sometimes the count d'Artois joined in their leud orgies; but the queen feared
<PB N="87" REF="027308_0093_0FD3FED52A1C1B08">
his approach. She knew that able game&s;ters do not play for nothing. The royal family mu&s;t already have been con&s;iderably aug|mented; but for the abortive no&s;trums given to Antoinette by Polignac. And the queen determined that future recour&s;e to their aid &s;hould be unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Her conduct in the meantime continued to be a &s;ubject of popular animadver&s;ion; and from day to day epigrams, pa&s;qui<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ades, and ballads were publi&s;hed, which proved the infamous depth to which &s;he had &s;unk in the e&s;timation of France. Of this gene|ral cen&s;ure &s;he could not long remain ig|norant. When &s;he di&s;covered it, the ha|tred which &s;he had conceived again&s;t France was increa&s;ed; and from that moment &s;he &s;wore its de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The means were ea&s;y. The mini&s;ter had long foretold the ruin which &s;he had meditated. One circum&s;tance was now wanting, and this ha&s;tened to arrive.</P>

<P>The princes of the blood royal of the hou&s;e of Bourbon had given frequent proofs of decided patrioti&s;m, and were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the public e&s;teem. But &s;he con&s;idered them as &s;o many weathercocks which might be turned at plea&s;ure by the lighte&s;t wind. She thought nothing more ea&s;y than to di&s;cover their &s;entiments, and &s;ubject them to her own management.</P>
<P>During this time &s;he &s;uffered much from the jealous, fierce, and impetuous temper of the duche&s;s de Polignac, which had now ari&s;en to an in&s;upportable exce&s;s.</P>
<P>The time of Antoinette was at this period divided between the gratification of her loo&s;er wi&s;hes, her &s;ervices to the emperor, and her attentions to the princes of the blood. The fir&s;t of the&s;e occupations was always her highe&s;t concern. Her brother now

<P>D'Artois, without being envious of the crown, had lavi&s;hed upon it all his cares. But the birth of a duke of Normandy, which was indeed the effect of his own exertions, cau&s;ed him to &s;hed tears of rage. And now was formed the mo&s;t horrid and dete&s;table of triumvirates. The members mutually engaged their &s;everal dependents, and &s;wore the de&s;truction of the people, and the total ruin of France. The prince d'Artois en|tered fully and cordially into this plot. He had peculiar rea&s;ons for becoming an enemy to his countrymen. On his return from his glorious expedition to Gibraltar, they had unmercifully loaded him with the mo&s;t

in&s;upportable raillery. He &s;till felt the di&s;|graceful wounds which his honor had re|ceived, and he &s;ighed for revenge.</P>
<P>An unexpected re&s;i&s;tance from a parlia|ment, on who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance this league had placed much dependence, cau&s;ed the com|mencement of this enterprize to prove abor|tive. The intractability of the parliament was at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed to be a mere feint. The league per&s;uaded the royal <HI>lion</HI> to roar, in order to frighten this di&s;obedient and ri|diculous areopagus to its duty. But the par|liament &s;till continued refractory; the Pa|ri&s;ians al&s;o mutinied and inve&s;ted the <HI>Palais.</HI> The inregi&s;terment of the extravagant edict which had been dictated by Louis, was now entru&s;ted to d'Artois, who began the bu&s;ine&s;s by giving the mo&s;t inconte&s;tible proofs of his ferocious and &s;anguinary character, and ended it with the &s;ame paltroonery as at Gibraltar. He mounted the <HI>grand e&s;calier,</HI> &s;wearing like a demoniac, his mouth foam|ing and his eyes fla&s;hing with rage. But

this ebullition of his &s;pirits was &s;oon cooled, and the hero de&s;cended fearfully, precipi|tately, and &s;hamefully. He flew to his car|riage, but too happy to have e&s;caped the vengeance of an audacious hand which had been rai&s;ed again&s;t him.</P>
<P>On his return to Ver&s;ailles, he a&s;&s;ured the king that <HI>he</HI> in future might take on <HI>him&s;elf</HI> the trouble of cau&s;ing his will to be exe|cuted.</P>
<P>The capital remained in a &s;tate of agita|tion and alarm. The corps de garde were attacked and defeated; and &s;oon after fol|lowed the famous genuflexion before the &s;tatue of Henry IV. This &s;pectacle drew tears from all who reflected how much his reign differed from the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The league beheld with &s;ecret &s;atisfaction the&s;e troubles and di&s;&s;en&s;ions, which pre|&s;aged tho&s;e calamities to the production of which they a&s;pired. Sen&s;ible, however, of

the nece&s;&s;ity of circum&s;pection, they waited in &s;ilence for the arrival of the fir&s;t favor|able occa&s;ion, of which they determined to profit. During this interval Antoinette be|&s;towed her time on a new &s;pecies of amu&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>As hobby-hor&s;es were fa&s;hionable at court, Antoinette now made choice of one for her&s;elf, and hers was a <HI>buffoon.</HI> That illu&s;trious pun&s;ter, the Marquis de Bi&egrave;vre, was elevated to this honorable po&s;t. He had recommended him&s;elf to the queen by nu|merous in&s;ipid epigrams, which he had made at his lei&s;ure, and di&s;tributed among the courtiers; a &s;et of beings, who, as they were de&s;titute of learning and ta&s;te, were incapable of a ju&s;t appreciation of literary merit, and from whom it need not be &s;ur|pri&s;ing that his &s;en&s;ele&s;s performances re|ceived the tribute of admiration and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>After the queen had made choice of this &s;on of dullne&s;s for a pre&s;ident, &s;he &s;elected

from the herd of &s;ycophants which &s;ur|rounded her, a number of members, quali|fied, in different degrees, by talents of a &s;imilar nature, and formed what &s;he deno|minated a cabinet of wit, or <HI>bureau d'e&s;prit.</HI> The wit of this &s;ociety con&s;i&s;ted wholly of <HI>puns;</HI> and it was in fact re&s;olved at one of their meetings, that any member who &s;hould &s;peak a certain number of minutes without making a pun, &s;hould be con&s;idered as hav|ing committed a crime, for which the pe|nalty of being &s;tiled <HI>leze-fanta&s;ie</HI> &s;hould be incurred. By the force of royal example, the rage for punning became at length &s;o prevalent, that it was vi&s;ible in public writ|ings of the mo&s;t &s;erious and important kind. Puns might be found in edicts, proclama|tions of the king, bills of taxation, and even in arr&ecirc;ts of the council. But the wor&s;t pun of all was the royal maje&s;ty it&s;elf.</P>

<P>ABOUT this time the mini&s;ter, Ca|lonne, became obnoxious to the queen. Being either unable or unwilling to &s;upply her with the enormous &s;ums which &s;he from day to day demanded from the national trea|&s;ury, he had ventured on giving a denial to &s;ome reque&s;ts of this nature. This auda|cious
<PB N="95" REF="027308_0101_0FD3FEE582096490">
conduct excited her re&s;entment, and cau&s;ed her to meditate his ruin. Ver&s;ed in all the arts of intrigue, and indefatigable in the pur&s;uit of revenge, &s;he &s;con di&s;covered the means of effecting his di&s;grace. She cau&s;ed private information to be given him, by &s;ome of her creatures, that a certain rival, anxious to obtain the place in the mi|ni&s;try which Calonne occupied, had deter|mined on his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. This treache|rous fiction was communicated in a manner which gave it a face of probability, and carried with it a conviction that produced the de&s;ired effect. The mini&s;ter, prudently e&s;teeming it a le&s;s misfortune to re&s;ign his employment than to be deprived of his life, retired from office with fearful precipitation.</P>
<P>Archbi&s;hop Brienne, an impious and un|principled character, &s;ucceeded Calonne as financier. His admini&s;tration &s;oon proved how de&s;titute of di&s;cernment was that &s;ove|reign who elevated him to this illu&s;trious employment. He managed the national trea|&s;ury
<PB N="96" REF="027308_0102_0FD3FEE7111853D8">
like a patrimony in which him&s;elf po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;ole and individual propriety. All his actions were devoted to one purpo&s;e, that of increa&s;ing his own e&s;tate. Antoinette and d'Artois found him the mo&s;t inconvenient per&s;on in the world to have the management of the trea&s;ury; for the &s;ums which he em|bezzled from it were embezzled only for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Louis, who&s;e confidence in his mini|&s;ter was unbounded, &s;ubmitted to his wife and brother the whole management of the mo&s;t important affairs of his council. He, from time to time, without examina|tion or thought, put the royal &s;ignature to every decree which was pre&s;ented to him. When he demanded if his people were hap|py, he was always an&s;wered in the affirma|tive, and he gave him&s;elf no further concern about the matter. Every murmur of the nation was intercepted in its pa&s;&s;age to the ears of the monarch; and as he did not hear the groans of his &s;ubjects, he &s;u&s;pected not
<PB N="97" REF="027308_0103_0FD3FEEAB56E0250">
the pains they &s;uffered. He was indeed &s;ometimes arou&s;ed to a little unea&s;ine&s;s when he contemplated the wretched &s;ituation of his finances, of which he could not be kept wholly ignorant; but he was &s;oon lulled to &s;leep again by the artifices of tho&s;e by whom he was &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>As, during the admini&s;tration of Briennes, Antoinette and d'Artois were denied that acce&s;s to the national trea&s;ury, by which their enormous expenditures had before been &s;upported, they now found them&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to private frauds. There was in Paris at this time, one M. Pinet, who, by a variety of &s;canda|lous means, had acquired immen&s;e riches. To him repeated applications were made for large &s;ums, which were not obtained without great difficulty, and many promi&s;es, of which the queen was &s;ufficiently lavi&s;h, of mo&s;t extravagant gratuities, to be paid, together with the principal, at a &s;hort credit. The&s;e &s;ums were quickly expended in riot
<PB N="98" REF="027308_0104_0FD3FEF132AAB018">
and di&s;&s;ipation by Antoinette and her beloved brother-in-law; and when the time of pay|ment arrived they had nothing to remit. But the mind or the queen, ever fertile in expedients, &s;oon devi&s;ed the means of being extricated from this difficulty: &s;he gave the word, and Pinet &s;uddenly di&s;appeared, and was heard of no more. Several others are &s;aid to have &s;uffered a fate &s;imilar to that of Pinet; and this inhuman traffic was carried on for &s;ome years. This pair of royal rob|bers drained the pur&s;es of many citizens of Paris and Ver&s;ailles, who had been im|men&s;ely rich. They began the&s;e negocia|tions with &s;miles and promi&s;es of favor, and u&s;ually ended them with death or the Ba&s;tille. Mo&s;t of the&s;e deluded money-lenders, after di&s;covering how much they had been duped, complained, with an imprudent bitterne&s;s, of the injuries they had &s;uffered. Le Noir and his cabal were at this time wholly at the devotion of the queen and her brother-in-law. Le Noir was governor of the Ba&s;tille, and he he&s;itated not to grant lettres de ca|chet
<PB N="99" REF="027308_0105_0FD3FEF29DAD9C48">
whenever they were demanded for the purpo&s;e of &s;ilencing audacious murmurs. The papers of the per&s;on impri&s;oned fell of cour&s;e into the hands of le Noir, and he, from time to time, di&s;po&s;ed of them as di|rected by his royal mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>This torrent of iniquity &s;welled to a mo&s;t enormous height, and in its cour&s;e bore down compa&s;&s;ion, humanity and ju&s;tice; ru|ined many of the mo&s;t valuable citizens, and de&s;troyed many of the fir&s;t e&s;tates in France. This mode of ra&s;ing money became, how|ever, &s;o notorious at length, that it could no longer be practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>D'Artois, that illu&s;trious knave, fertile in expedients, &s;ugge&s;ted one to our heroine, which, in the event, proved very advanta|geous to this luxurious pair. He put her in mind of the a&s;cendency which &s;he had over her hu&s;band, and the advantages that might be derived from it. Infected by the inebriety of the tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e
<PB N="100" REF="027308_0106_0FD3FEF48646A4C8">
by whom he was &s;urrounded, the king had almo&s;t lo&s;t &s;ight of him&s;elf. He had become le&s;s &s;evere in his economy, which he now frequently relaxed in favor of good cheer. He had, in &s;hort, either to di&s;&s;ipate the gloom of anxiety, or gratify a depraved ap|petite, contracted an habit of drinking to con&s;iderable exce&s;s. In the moments of in|toxication, his fondne&s;s for his <HI>faithful</HI> An|toinette was redoubled, and in the ardor of affection, in&s;pired at once by love and wine, he could refu&s;e nothing to the idol of his &s;oul. By the advice of d'Artois, Antoinette prevailed on her royal &s;pou&s;e, in one of the&s;e paroxy&s;ms, to &s;ign a paper containing a &s;olemn abdication of his kingdom. This, however, was extorted from him with great difficulty, and the queen, in effecting it, brought into exerci&s;e every artifice of which &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s. Tears, care&s;&s;es and threats were alternately employed for &s;ome time in vain; but at length Louis was overcome, and &s;uffered the pen to be put into his hand, which, being guided by Antoinette, reluc|tantly
<PB N="101" REF="027308_0107_0FD3FEF6146A45C8">
made the important &s;ignature. When the king recovered from his intoxication, he recollected with &s;hame and di&s;tre&s;s the fatal folly of which he had been guilty the preceding evening, and flew to the queen with anxious ha&s;te, intending, if po&s;&s;ible, to per&s;uade her to re&s;ign the in&s;trument he had executed, almo&s;t in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibi|lity. This was what &s;he wi&s;hed and ex|pected; &s;he had now an opportunity of taking the advantage of his fears, which &s;he improved to its utmo&s;t bounds. She at fir&s;t peremptorily refu&s;ed to part with the writ|ing, and every argument of Louis proved ineffectual, till he offered her an enormous &s;um of money to be paid from his trea&s;ury in exchange for it. This propo&s;al prevailed on her, and a compromi&s;e took place. The &s;tipulated &s;um was actually paid, and di|vided between Antoinette and the contriver of this admirable plot. This event al&s;o operated in their favor with Brienne, who now no longer remained intractable. He began, like Calonne, to perceive that he
<PB N="102" REF="027308_0108_0FD3FEF791D87F28">
could not enjoy the fruits of his villainies in &s;afety without con&s;enting to a divi&s;ion of them. His ill-gotten trea&s;ure, while it &s;ecretly delighted his archiepi&s;copal bo&s;om, made him tremble with apprehen&s;ions of di&s;covery and puni&s;hment. He therefore cordially entered into the mea&s;ures of An|toinette and d'Artois, and paid from the trea&s;ury, without objection, the enormous &s;ums demanded, re&s;ting his hopes of impu|nity in ca&s;e of extremity, on the king's &s;ig|nature, which was given into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It mu&s;t have appeared &s;urpri&s;ing to Louis, that the fondne&s;s of his wife &s;hould have redoubled at the moment when he had lea&s;t rea&s;on to expect it. This was in fact the ca&s;e; and his &s;u&s;picions were from day to day increa&s;ed by her frequent &s;olicitations for orders on the trea&s;ury, which were al|ways enforced by a profu&s;ion of care&s;&s;es, and of the&s;e at other times &s;he had of late been &s;ufficiently par&s;imonious. Being thus arou&s;ed to &s;ome vigilance, the monarch at length di&s;covered the collu&s;ion between the
<PB N="103" REF="027308_0109_0FD3FEF917FA6D80">
queen, d'Artois and Brienne. He was now confirmed in his opinion, and immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Brienne from office: he al&s;o be|haved to Antoinette for a while with unu|&s;ual coldne&s;s; but he could never prevail on him&s;elf to treat her with that contempt &s;he de&s;erved.</P>
<P>Our pair of royal libertines being now once more reduced to extremity, entered upon the execution of a plot which they had often contemplated, and from which human nature revolts. This had been at|tempted once before, but un&s;ucce&s;sfully, at the time of the cata&s;trophe of the <HI>Palais de Ju&s;tice.</HI> D'Artois now made every po&s;&s;ible exertion to rally the male-contents. The moment that his &s;i&s;ter-in-law informed him that they could no longer have acce&s;s to the trea&s;ury, he employed him&s;elf, in com|pliance with her advice, in laying the foun|dation of the mo&s;t dete&s;table of ari&s;tocracies. All the Polignacs, as will readily be ima|gined, were imitated, and the favorite <HI>Jules</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="027308_0110_0FD3FEFA8115E0B8">
was particularly commi&s;&s;ioned to bring over the princes of the blood, over whom &s;he had much influence. The plea&s;ures of Ma|ria Antoinette now &s;uffered an interval. The management of her creatures, the de|&s;truction of the throne, and the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of that de&s;poti&s;m for which &s;he labor|ed, occupied all her thoughts. Be&s;enval, Broglie, d'Autichamp, and many others, entered with ardor into this infernal league. Madame Jules de Polignac neglected nothing that could expedite the completion of this mon&s;trous a&s;&s;ociation. She promi&s;ed pen|&s;ions, places, and dignities with unlimited profu&s;ion; nor did &s;he he&s;itate at pro&s;titu|tion where &s;he imagined it would prove the mo&s;t powerful bribe. By the&s;e various means &s;he added con&s;iderable numbers to the league. She per&s;uaded not only the princes of the blood royal, Conde, Conti, Bour|bon, &amp;c. but al&s;o a great many male-contents of the clergy, &s;everal di&s;graced courtiers and noblemen who had been di&s;placed by the king.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="027308_0111_0FD3FEFC088EDF48">Antoinette was unanimou&s;ly named chief of this horrible con&s;piracy.

To this end, &s;he made it a rendezvous for her a&s;&s;ociates, and ap|pointed a&s;&s;ignations there with her more immediate favorites. Her beloved brother-in-law, and the Duche&s;s de Polignac, were often joined in her a&s;&s;ignations, and this illu&s;trious trio, in the&s;e clande&s;tine meetings, gave a-loo&s;e to every wanton exce&s;s that their debauched minds could dictate.</P>

was at hand. The only thing which retarded its arrival was the great confidence placed by the king in his mini&s;ter Necker. It was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be deprived either of his office or his life; and, in ca&s;e the former could not be effected, it was de|termined to have recour&s;e to the latter.&mdash; Juigne, the archbi&s;hop, one of the confede|rates, was con&s;idered by Antoinette and her council as the propere&s;t per&s;on to be em|ployed in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;he undertook to commi&s;&s;ion and in&s;truct him for the pur|po&s;e. To this end &s;he &s;ent for the ambi|tious prelate, and addre&s;&s;ed him in the man|ner following:&mdash;<Q>Is it not, my dear friend, unfortunate for us, that Necker, a man oppo&s;ed to all our mea&s;ures, and inflexible to all per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;hould continue in an office which gives &s;uch influence in the &s;tate? we think he ought to be removed; this, however, we find difficult to be ef|fected.

<P>Being thus in&s;tructed, the hypocritical prelate &s;ought the king, and addre&s;&s;ed him in the following manner:&mdash;<Q>Sire, art thou a king, and &s;uffere&s;t irreligion to reign, as it were, conjointly with thee? It is an athei&s;t who gives laws to France, under the title of a mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King! What dreadful con&s;equences may we not expect from &s;uch iniquities!

<P>This in&s;olent &s;peech had the de&s;ired effect on Louis. Terrified with the me|naces of the prie&s;t, he &s;eemed already to behold the pillars of heaven de&s;cending to cru&s;h him. Unable to re&s;i&s;t the fears that overwhelmed him, he &s;ent for the papers of Necker, and ordered him to retire from Paris in four and twenty hours.</P>
<P>At length arrived the evening when the bloody tragedy was to be executed, the even|ing of the 14th of July, 1789. The con|federates were all prepared. The queen enjoyed the mo&s;t confident hopes of &s;ucce&s;s,

and anticipated the delights which &s;he ex|pected would re&s;ult from it. But, through &s;ome imprudence of Lambi&s;c, the plot took air, and the citizens of Paris were alarmed. The di&s;appointment, confu&s;ion and terror which took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the con&s;pirators when they learnt the Pari&s;ians had taken arms, cannot be de&s;cribed. La Polignac, d'Artois, and &s;everal other members of the a&s;&s;ociation, immediately betook them&s;elves to flight. The king repaired to the Hotel-de-ville, whither Antoinette was, in fact, plea&s;ed to &s;ee him go, although &s;he affected to be much grieved at parting with him.</P>

<P>A NEW con&s;titution was, &s;oon after, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the people, and Antoinette, although &s;he &s;ecretly cur&s;ed the mea&s;ure, had the policy to be apparently plea&s;ed, and to comply with the wi&s;hes of the people. Her engagements in political matters, how|ever, cau&s;ed no abatement in her fondne&s;s for riot, luxury and di&s;&s;ipation. She found means to &s;olace her&s;elf even under the mor|tification of her greate&s;t di&s;appointments. Mothier and La Fayette were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively the generals of the people.

<P>ALL the enormous dilapidations of An|toinette, her innumerable amorous intrigues, her vices, her haughtine&s;s, and barbarity, all the&s;e obtained the pardon of the French nation. In &s;pite of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation to which they had been reduced by the &s;hameful irregularities and inhuman plots of their queen, a queen who no longer de|&s;erved the title, &s;he was yet &s;uffered to live unpuni&s;hed. But the genero&s;ity of her peo|ple could make no impre&s;&s;ion on her unfeel|ing heart. A &s;tranger to every good, to every grateful &s;entiment, &s;he was unable to arre&s;t her&s;elf in that headlong career of vice with which &s;he had &s;et out in life, even when &s;he found her&s;elf ready to plunge into the gulph of ruin, which &s;he had prepared
<PB N="120" REF="027308_0127_0FD3FF1C58EAEFD0">
for her &s;ubjects. The commi&s;&s;ion of every &s;pecies of crimes was &s;o incorporated with her con&s;titution, that &s;he neither knew com|punction, nor was capable of repentance; and &s;he per&s;evered in guilt till the eyes of her people were forced open. Such became the publicity of her vices, and &s;o con&s;picu|ous was the bitterne&s;s of her enmity to the nation to which &s;he ought to have perform|ed the part of a parent and protectre&s;s, that longer &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;o vile a &s;overeign would have forever characteri&s;ed France as the mo&s;t abject and de&s;picable of nations.</P>
<P>After the revolution, the di&s;potic club, of which Maria Antoinette was chief, did not entirely neglect their operations: the mem|bers of which it was compo&s;ed continued to draw from her a contagion of &s;entiment, which was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread, and poi&s;oned many.</P>
<P>To what period, unhappy people, do you procra&s;tinate the day of your tranquillity?

How long will you &s;uffer men, or rather demons, who, while they &s;tyle them&s;elves the fathers of their country, aim the po|niard of death at its bo&s;om, to enter your councils and legi&s;latures?

<P>One of tho&s;e writers, who, through fear, or affected mode&s;ty, pretends to aim at the
<PB N="122" REF="027308_0129_0FD3FF1F407B69C0">
greate&s;t impartiality, &s;peaks of Antoinette in the following manner:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>I &s;hall &s;ay but little of Marie Antoinette. Once, perhaps, too much adored, and now too much calumniated, &s;he appears neither to merit the extravagant eulogi|ums which have been lavi&s;hed on the <HI>Dauphine,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She was dauphine before &s;he was queen.</NOTE> nor the atrocious imputations which have been heaped on the queen. This mu&s;t, however, be left for po&s;terity to determine. I &s;hall not examine parti|cularly into her attachment to a brother, to which, perhaps, may be owing &s;ome part of the pre&s;ent exhau&s;ted &s;tate of our finances, and the new &s;acrifices which have been made by France to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that it is extremely difficult, not to &s;ay impo&s;|&s;ible, entirely to dive&s;t our&s;elves of every &s;entiment of tenderne&s;s for the country where we are born; for the parents who have care&s;&s;ed, protected and nouri&s;hed us in our helple&s;s infancy; and for tho&s;e who
<PB N="123" REF="027308_0130_0FD3FF20B747CF48">
have earlie&s;t awakened in our bo&s;oms tho&s;e &s;oft affections which con&s;titute the happine&s;s of mankind. It is difficult to forget the tender connexions of daughter, of &s;i&s;ter, of parent, and even tho&s;e who only owe their birth to the &s;ame &s;oil; and it &s;eems, that, were it practicable, it would do no honor to the &s;oul capable of doing it. What then can be done to e&s;cape the dangers to which a &s;tate is expo&s;ed by the marriage of its monarch to a foreign queen? Let him chu&s;e a wife from his own nation. Such an alliance may at fir&s;t appear unworthy the blood royal, for there being but one &s;overeign, he mu&s;t marry a &s;ubject. But now that the king is no more than the fir&s;t citizen, he can|not di&s;honor him&s;elf by giving his hand and his heart to a free citizen, who by her virtues and accompli&s;hments merited the love of her nation. This would un|doubtedly excite the ambition of the fa|mily from which the queen might be cho|&s;en. This to be &s;ure is an evil, but far

from being equal to tho&s;e we have always &s;uffered from alliances with foreign fami|lies. In the former ca&s;e, it is ea&s;y to re|&s;i&s;t the machinations of a &s;ingle family; but in the latter, we mu&s;t combat with empires.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The one &s;ometimes gives occa&s;ions to dome&s;tic quarrels; the other frequently to wars, and almo&s;t always to very ruinous &s;acrifices. In the former ca&s;e, the nation|al a&s;&s;embly &s;hould confine the ambition of the family preferred: in the latter, the in|fluence of a queen, who&s;e heart is in|imical to the nation, mu&s;t always prove active and dangerous. I have thought it might be u&s;eful to render this idea public. It is at lea&s;t important enough to merit di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the time the&s;e ob&s;ervations were made, France was under the government of a limited monarchy.</NOTE></P>

I &s;hall &s;ay, that the &s;hocks given to our empire by its earlie&s;t &s;overeigns were le&s;s violent than tho&s;e it has received from its more cruel enemy, Marie Antoinette. I &s;hall &s;ay, that it was by her hand that M. de Vergennes died empoi&s;oned. It was &s;he who always aimed at the de&s;truction of France, that, on its ruins, &s;he might enjoy the barbarous &s;a|tisfaction of &s;eeing her brother's empire enlarged. It was &s;he who forced the count d'Artois to become the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of his brother, after having been the defiler of his bed. I &s;hall &s;ay, that thou&s;ands have been &s;ub&s;ervient to her plea&s;ures, and have almo&s;t all of them been afterwards &s;acri|ficed by her own hand. It was &s;he, who, during their nocturnal orgies, blew up in their hearts the flame of civil war. It was &s;he, who, laying a&s;ide her aver&s;ion to the national habit, did not blu&s;h to grant her favors to general Mothier, in order to con|cert with him her &s;chemes of vengeance.
<PB N="126" REF="027308_0133_0FD3FF28EB9AA0D0">
It was through her influence that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in Bouill&eacute; was named to the expedition of Nancy.

of the Republic, by agents devoted to her, whom &s;he &s;ub&s;idized and cau&s;ed to be paid out of the trea&s;ury of the <HI>cidevant</HI> civil li&s;t; that at various epochs &s;he has em|ployed every manoeuvre that &s;he thought con&s;i&s;tent with her perfidious views to bring out a counter-revolution; fir&s;t, hav|ing, under a pretext of a nece&s;&s;ary re|union between the <HI>cidevant</HI> Gardes-du-corps, and the officers and &s;oldiers of the regiment of Flanders, contrived a repa&s;t between the&s;e two corps on the 1&s;t of October, 1789, which degenerated into an ab&s;olute orgy as &s;he de&s;ired, and dur|ing the cour&s;e of which, the agents of the widow Capet perfectly &s;econded her coun|ter-revolutionary projects; brought the greater part of the gue&s;ts, in the moment of inebriety, to &s;ing &s;ongs expre&s;&s;ive of their mo&s;t entire devotion to the Throne, and the mo&s;t marked aver&s;ion for the peo|ple: of having excited them <HI>in&s;en&s;ibly</HI> to wear the white cockade, and to tread the national cockade under foot; and of hav|ing

authori&s;ed, by her pre&s;ence, all the counter-revolutionary exce&s;&s;es, particular|ly in encouraging the women who ac|companied her, to di&s;tribute the&s;e white cockades among the gue&s;ts; and having, on the 14th of the &s;ame month, te&s;tified the mo&s;t immoderate joy at what pa&s;&s;ed during the&s;e orgies.</P>
<P><Q>Secondly, having, in concert with Louis Capet, directed to be di&s;tributed very plentifully throughout the kingdom, publications of a counter-revolutionary nature, &s;ome of which were pretended to have been publi&s;hed by the con&s;pirators on the other &s;ide of the Rhine, (mean|ing, we &s;uppo&s;e, at Coblentz) &s;uch as&mdash; <HI>Petitions to the emigrants&mdash;reply of the emigrants&mdash;the emigrants to the people&mdash; the &s;horte&s;t follies are the be&s;t&mdash;the order of march&mdash;the return of the emigrants,</HI> and other &s;uch writings: of having even carried her perfidy and di&s;&s;imulation to &s;uch a height, as to have circulated writ|ings

<P>The different charges ran to a prodigious length. The following is a &s;hort ab&s;tract of the charges on which the trial turned:</P>
<P><HI>Marie Antoinette</HI> was further accu&s;ed, that being brought to Paris, &s;he immedi|ately began to intrigue with the members of the legi&s;lature&mdash;and held nightly meet|ings with them.</P>
<P><Q>That &s;he was acce&s;&s;ary in getting bad mini&s;ters appointed, in order that her views might be a&s;&s;i&s;ted;&mdash;that her creatures were placed in all the public offices; men who were known to be con&s;pirators to liberty;&mdash;that &s;he was acce&s;&s;ary in brib|ing the members of the Legi&s;ative A&s;&s;em|bly

to declare war again&s;t the Emperor, her brother;&mdash;that &s;he gave intelligence to the enemy of the plans of the campaign, as &s;oon as they were determined by the council; which was the cau&s;e of many failures which the French arms experi|enced;&mdash;that &s;he combined with her agents in plotting the overthrow of the con&s;titution on the 10th day of Augu&s;t, 1792;&mdash;that on the 9th of the &s;ame month, &s;he got a number of Swi&s;s guards into the Thuilleries, encouraged them to make cartouches, and annimated Louis Capet to order his &s;oldiers to fire;&mdash;that the next day, the 10th of Augu&s;t, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed and &s;olicited Louis Capet to go to the Thuilleries at five in the morning, to review the <HI>real</HI> Swi&s;s guards and tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;umed their uniform; and at his re|turn &s;he pre&s;ented him with a pi&s;tol, &s;ay|ing, <HI>'This is the moment</HI> TO SHOW YOUR|SELF;' and on his refu&s;ing &s;he called him a coward;&mdash;that, finally, the civil war

which now rages in France, has been produced by her intrigues.</Q></P>
<P>The queen confe&s;&s;ed in her interrogatory, that it was &s;he who opened and locked the door of the apartment through which the family made their e&s;cape in June, 1791; that independent of the confe&s;&s;ion of the widow Capet in this re&s;pect, it is confirm|ed, by the te&s;timony of <HI>Louis Charles Capet,</HI> and by his &s;i&s;ter, that <HI>de la Fayette</HI> favoured all the de&s;igns of the widow Capet, in the &s;ame manner as <HI>Bailly</HI> did while he was Mayor of Paris, and that both were pre&s;ent when the fugitives e&s;caped, and favored their flight as much as lay in their power.</P>
<P>This Prince&s;s &s;uffered under the axe of the guillotine, on Wedne&s;day, the 16th of October, 1793, old &s;tile, after having been condemned by the Revolutionary Tribunal, <HI>as guilty of having been acce&s;&s;ary to, and hav|ing co-operated in different manoeuvres again&s;t the liberty of France; of having entertained a

<P>The execution took place at a quarter pa&s;t twelve, P. M. The whole armed force in Paris was on foot, from the pri&s;on of the Conciergerie to the Place de la Re|volution, beyond the garden of the Thuil|leries. The &s;treets were lined by two very clo&s;e rows of armed citizens. Henriot, the commander in chief, attended the queen in a private coach, with a guard of cavalry to the place of execution. She was accompa|nied by the cidevant curate of St. Landry, a con&s;titutional prie&s;t; and on the &s;caffold pre&s;erved her natural dignity of mind.</P>

<P>A De&s;cription of the <HI>guillotine,</HI> or fatal machine, by which the late king and queen of France &s;uffered, and which takes its name from the per&s;on; who brought it into u&s;e, has been indu&s;triou&s;ly handed the pub|lic, both through Briti&s;h and American pa|pers, with an apparent intention of height|ening the horror of the act; but, <HI>note well,</HI> the origin of the con&s;truction of it, and the intention of the machine by the original projectors, have been as indu&s;triou&s;ly con|cealed. It is with plea&s;ure, by the help of a patriotic corre&s;pondent (and <HI>to vindicate the ways of God to man)</HI> that we undeceive the public with re&s;pect to this novel piece of mechani&s;m, by a&s;&s;erting, from good au|thority,

that the guillotine was con&s;tructed by the ari&s;tocrats at Paris; that the king and queen in&s;pected it with plea&s;ure; and that it was intended to be u&s;ed by the re|doubtable duke of Brun&s;wick, (the valiant brother of George the IIId.) in the behead|ing of all the convention of France, and others who &s;hould not have been murdered by the &s;word, and other means of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion, of the ho&s;t who &s;hould oppo&s;e his all-conquering manife&s;to.&mdash;What a change is here!
