<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>God</HI> and of the <HI>Souls</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> prevailed with me to write the following <HI>Treati&s;e,</HI> to pay the Debt I have long owed to my fellow Creatures; in intreating them to enter into their own Hearts, and learn <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> of <HI>God him&s;elf,</HI> who &s;peaks <HI>there</HI> by <HI>His Spirit</HI> as never <HI>Man</HI> &s;poke; who &s;peaks <HI>there</HI> to much better Purpo&s;e, with <HI>clearer Evidence</HI> and <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> than <HI>Men</HI> can <HI>&s;peak; that their Faith might not &s;tand in the Wi&s;dom of Men, but in the Power of God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Which is the <HI>only Remedy,</HI> as I apprehend, for <HI>re&s;toring Piety</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> to its <HI>primative</HI> Purity and Beauty, in an Age wherein the ex|ce&s;&s;ive Preten&s;ion to Power, in <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the <HI>Clergy</HI> (perhaps not of the be&s;t Lives) have made a great many Men of <HI>excellent</HI> Capacities

<HI>too loo&s;e,</HI> and <HI>indifferent</HI> unto <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Re|ligion.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis &s;ad to think, that becau&s;e &s;ome <HI>high Pretenders</HI> to <HI>Religion,</HI> who are of bad Lives and Principles, would exerci&s;e <HI>Dominion</HI> over the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI> of others, and turn <HI>Re|ligion</HI> into <HI>worldly</HI> Riches and Immunities, make <HI>Gain</HI> their <HI>Godline&s;s,</HI> and the <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> of <HI>Power</HI> their <HI>earne&s;t Pur&s;uit</HI>; (I &s;ay 'tis &s;ad to think) that therefore Religion, the mo&s;t <HI>noble</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> Thing in the World, &s;hould fall be|low the <HI>Regards</HI> of Men.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e Men of <HI>bright</HI> Parts and <HI>great</HI> Inge|nuity, have by the <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> baffled tho&s;e <HI>exorbitant</HI> Claims; to think therefore <HI>God</HI> doth not afford Men any <HI>&s;uperior Light</HI> and <HI>Aid</HI>; this is to run into the other Ex|tream.</P>
<P>For tho' none of the <HI>real</HI> Injunctions of <HI>Re|ligion</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> are, or ever can be contrary to <HI>right Rea&s;on,</HI> yet the <HI>common Rea&s;on</HI> of Man &s;tands in Need of <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Help</HI> from <HI>Heaven,</HI> for attaining the <HI>true</HI> Knowledge and Practice of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI>; as the great <HI>Lock</HI> acknow|ledgeth, in the Quotations I have made from him in my fifth Chapter. Which <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Help</HI> from <HI>Heaven, is</HI> &s;o far from being <HI>de&s;truc|tive</HI>

<P>For Men &s;ometimes finding clear Di&s;coveries of God in their Minds, and of their Duty to him on the one Hand; and of the Darkne&s;s, Impurity and Unpreparedne&s;s of their own Hearts for his Service, on the other Hand; are apt to impute tho&s;e Di&s;coveries to the Light and Activity of their own Rea&s;on; or not to acknowledge that they are beholden to the immediate Revelation of God's Spirit within them for &s;uch Di&s;coveries; when one would think nothing in it &s;elf can be clearer, than that Darkne&s;s cannot give Light for the Di&s;|covery

of it &s;elf: <HI>For what&s;oever doth make manife&s;t is Light</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Eph. v. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on corrupted and depraved by vicious Habits, cannot di&s;cover the Corruption and Depravity of it &s;elf, without Light from Hea|ven, gives it &s;uch Sight; much le&s;s can it with|out &s;uch Help know God and divine Things.
<Q>It was all purely the Work of Grace (&s;ays the great <HI>Lock</HI>) for they were all dead in Tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es, and Sins, and could do nothing, not make one Step or the lea&s;t Motion towards it&mdash; 'tis God here (&s;ays he) does all by Revelation, of what they could never di&s;|cover by their own natural Faculties &mdash; and being thus quickened by the Spirit (&s;ays he) may as Men alive, work if they will. <BIBL><HI>Vol.</HI> iii. <HI>Fol.</HI> 359.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>To deny Men the Influences of the divine Spirit, is to leave them without God in the World. To &s;ay the Light of humane Rea&s;on without Light from any Thing above it, is the Light of God's Spirit, or the only Light that is in Man, is to take one of the mo&s;t effectual Cour&s;es that can be, to overturn the Chri&s;tian Religion, which is founded on divine Revelation, and can only be &s;avingly under&s;tood
<PB N="vii" REF="003985_0006_10036B553B6CB138">
and practi&s;ed by the Influence of the &s;ame Spirit which gave it Being. It ca&s;ts a very ill A&s;pect on Devotion, and directly and unavoida|bly tends to render all Addre&s;&s;es to God, for Light and Help from him ridiculous and in|&s;ignificant: For if we our &s;elves without any immediate Influence and Aid from him, are able by the Exerci&s;e of our own natural Powers and Faculties, to know and practi&s;e our whole Duty, to what Purpo&s;e do we ask Light and Aid from him?</P>
<P>This Scheme tends to take off all Depen|dance upon God, and the Light and Tuition of his holy Spirit, for Under&s;tanding and Strength; and to bring Men to depend on them&s;elves and their own Sufficiency; the fatal Con&s;e|quence of which too much appears in the World already, in the loo&s;e and vicious Lives of Men; and is too likely to appear in a greater Degree, unle&s;s Men can be per&s;waded to for|&s;ake the evil Ways of their own Hearts, ad|dre&s;s them&s;elves to God, and depend upon, and become Subject to the Light and Power of his good Spirit in their own Souls.</P>
<P>It was therefore my principal De&s;ign in the following Undertaking, to &s;et before the Eyes of Men, and make it as plain to them as po&s;|&s;ibly I could, that the Light of their Spirit
<PB N="viii" REF="003985_0007_10036B582BA46CA0">
and of God's Spirit are of different and di&s;tinct Natures and Kinds. That their own natural Powers and Faculties alone are not adequate for attaining to the Knowledge and Practice of true Piety and Religion; and that therefore they mu&s;t apply them&s;elves to God for Light and Help from Heaven, who is ready to <HI>&s;hine into their Hearts</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv, 6.</NOTE>, and to <HI>work in them, to will and to do of his own good Plea&s;ure</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Phil. ii. 12.13.</NOTE>, if they will but withdraw their Hearts from this World and turn them to him, that he may purge them from evil, and di&s;po&s;e them to Virtue and the Love of Him&s;elf; and prepare them for &s;uch divine Sen&s;ations of his Goodne&s;s, as will fill them with inconceiveable Delights, <HI>with Joys un&s;peakable and full of Glory</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 8.</NOTE> In Compari&s;on of which all the Plea&s;ures of this World are Nullities and Vanity.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, that on the various Subjects treated of in the following Pages, I have en|deavoured, according to the be&s;t Light I had, to &s;peak of them, as clearly and di&s;tinctly as I could (which is all that can be expected from me) that the Reader might form, with as much Ea&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, right Idea's thereof; and from thence take Occa&s;ion, if he &s;hall be piou&s;ly and religiou&s;ly inclined, to make Tryal of the

<P>May it plea&s;e Almighty God to make this &s;mall Tract of &s;uch U&s;e to &s;ome Souls, and I &s;hall think it Satisfaction enough for all my Labour and Pains therein.

<HEAD>AN ESSAY Concerning the Re&s;toration of Primitive Chri&s;tianity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Rea&s;on and De&s;ign of Piety and Re|ligion.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing more becoming ra|tional Creatures, than an early and con|&s;tant Con&s;ideration of the Cau&s;e and De&s;ign of their Being; how they came to have Exi&s;t|ence in this World, and for what End.</P>
<P>It is prepo&s;terous to think that our Exi&s;tence was the Effect of meer Chance and Accident. The wonderful Order and Contrivance of the Parts, of which Man and the whole World of Beings are con&s;tituted; and the Support and Sub&s;i&s;tence of &s;uch an innumerable Company of Beings, in &s;uch Beauty and Har|mony, as is evidently maintained in the Uni|ver&s;e; prove nothing le&s;s, than, that the &s;ame
<PB N="2" REF="003985_0011_10036B60F8FFFAE0">
is the Effect and De&s;ign, of incomprehen&s;ible Wi&s;dom. So that it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible for any Man who gives him&s;elf the Liberty of think|ing, to doubt the Exi&s;tence of a Being who made, and &s;u&s;tains, &s;uch an infinite Number of Creatures: Which Being we ju&s;tly call Almighty God. So that hence the Cau&s;e of our Being is clearly manife&s;t.</P>
<P>The next thing to be con&s;idered, is, what we may rea&s;onably conclude, this infinitely wi&s;e, and Almighty Being, de&s;igned in the Production of Mankind.</P>
<P>Can it rea&s;onably be thought, that he in|tended any thing le&s;s than their Felicity ac|cording to their &s;everal Capacities, as well as his own Glory? That Man whom he hath made the noble&s;t of all his Creatures, here on Earth, endowed with rea&s;on and Under|&s;tanding, was not in an e&s;pecial Manner, de|&s;igned to be a Partaker of the Fruition, and Felicity of his Maker?</P>
<P>That, <HI>Man,</HI> as to his Body, is provided for in a Degree above the Bea&s;ts of the Field, the Fowls of the Air, the Fi&s;hes of the Sea, and all other animate Beings, who have the Life of Sen&s;ation, whom they all fear in Virtue of the natural Dominion God hath given him over them, will, I doubt not, be readily agreed; and that he con&s;i&s;ts of Body and Soul, an out|ward and an inward Man, endowed with pro|per
<PB N="3" REF="003985_0012_10036B66360091D8">
Sen&s;es adapted to the Knowledge of Things external and vi&s;ible; and a Mind, Soul, or intellectual Spirit, with inward Sen&s;es, &s;uited and adapted to the Preception and Enjoy|ment of internal and &s;piritual Objects, is evi|dent: For the Accommodation and Felicity whereof, 'tis mo&s;t rea&s;onable to believe, that God in his infinite Goodne&s;s hath made plen|tiful Provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>For can it be thought that the infinite and gracious God, &s;hould make le&s;s Provi&s;ion for our Souls, than for our Bodies; that he who hath &s;o richly provided, for our outward Man, &s;hould neglect the better and nobler Part of us, our Souls? that He who has provided a beautiful External World for the Plea&s;ure and Entertainment of the Sen&s;es of our outward Man, &s;hould not al&s;o have provided, a much more beautiful and glorious World, for the Plea&s;ure and Entertainment of the &s;uperiour Sen&s;es of our Inward Man?</P>
<P>For as the Sen&s;es of the inward Man, mu&s;t needs be as much more excellent than tho&s;e of the outward Man, as the inward Man is more excellent than the outward; &s;o con&s;e|quently, mu&s;t the Objects of Sen&s;ation of the former be much more excellent than the Objects of Sen&s;ation of the latter.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations afford a &s;olid Foun|dation, for a noble Pur&s;uit of true Religion,
<PB N="4" REF="003985_0013_10034F32B58074F8">
and the attaining the Knowledge, of the things of the heavenly Kingdom; for when Men are fully per&s;waded, that they have in|ward Sen&s;es &s;uited and adapted to the Know|ledge of God, and Enjoyment of him, they will not (if they con&s;ult their own Intere&s;t) &s;et their Hearts on the &s;hort lived Plea&s;ures, and Enjoyments of this World, which we every Day &s;ee to be exceeding tran&s;itory and uncertain; but being as it were loo&s;e and in|different, as to the Things of this Life, will ardently &s;eek a divine Sen&s;ation, of the Plea|&s;ures and Enioyments of the &s;piritual Kingdom, called in the &s;acred Writings, <HI>The Kingdom of God</HI>; which will afford them more &s;atisfaction and delight, than, the Encrea&s;e of the Corn, Wine, and Oyle, of the Earth can do.</P>
<P>We are to be here but a very little Time, and 'tis hard to think that, that noble and excel|lent Part of us our Souls or inward Man, en|dowed with &s;uch wonderful and exten&s;ive Capacities, which nothing le&s;s than the Knowledge and Enjoyment of God him&s;elf can truly and compleatly &s;atisfy, will be di&s;|&s;olved with our Bodies; tho' were it to be &s;o, which is entirely irrational to think, from the nature of Things; yet a Life in this World, in which, tho&s;e noble Powers and Faculties of the Soul, are enlightened and actuated by the Divine Spirit, and brought
<PB N="5" REF="003985_0014_10034F6CDFC6DF58">
into a real Sen&s;ation, of the Things of the <HI>heavenly Kingdom,</HI> whereby our evil Incli|nations and Pa&s;&s;ions, which give us &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s, while they are predominant, would be brought under and mortified; and the Love of God and our Neighbour, a quiet and &s;erene Mind and Con&s;cience, one of the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings on Earth, will naturally en&s;ue; &s;uch a Life cannot but be the mo&s;t de&s;ireable and delightful. And therefore it may very well be &s;aid, that, <HI>Godline&s;s has the Promi&s;e of the Life that now is,</HI> as well as, <HI>of that which is to come</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It hath been too much, more is the pity, the De&s;ign of a Generation of Men, who have called them&s;elves God's Prie&s;ts or Mini&s;ters, among Heathens, Mahometans, Jews, and Chri&s;tians, to render Religion very my&s;terious, and thereby them&s;elves more nece&s;&s;ary, than there is ju&s;t Occa&s;ion for; which they have improved to the accumulating the Power, and Riches of this World to them&s;elves; to the great &s;candal and Damage of true Religion; and to the exceeding Di&s;couragement of the Pur&s;uit of divine Knowledge, and a true Sen&s;e of God and Goodne&s;s, among Mankind. Erecting a Dominion over the Con&s;ciences of the Laity, and dealing out to them &s;uch
<PB N="6" REF="003985_0015_10036B6A756E0A20">
<HI>Creeds</HI> and <HI>Sy&s;tems</HI> of Religion as they thought fit, in the &s;everal Parts of the World where they had Power, which the unthinking Part of Mankind have been obliged to receive, on peril of the Lo&s;s of the Good Things of this Life, and as far as in them lay Damna|tion in the Life which is to come.</P>
<P>Tho' at the &s;ame Time nothing can well be plainer, than, that the Knowledge of the Chri&s;tian Religion, is adapted to Men of in|feriour, as well as &s;uperiour Capacities, the Souls of the former, being as precious in the Eyes of God, and as capable of enjoying him, as the latter. And therefore it is, that as God affords Mankind, an <HI>external Luminary,</HI> the Sun in the Firmament for their Bodies, by which Medium Men may &s;ee the Things of this World, without the Help of the Magi|&s;trate; So he al&s;o in his great Mercy affords, an <HI>internal</HI> Luminary, <HI>The Sun of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI> for their Minds; whereby Men may &s;ee the Things of God, and of the World to come, without the Help of Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>It is true that the Mini&s;ters of Religion, them&s;elves, being turned to God, have been, and &s;till are of great U&s;e, in turning People to this <HI>Light of God</HI> in their Souls; advi&s;ing them to open their inward Eyes to it, and to walk therein; that they may know and under&s;tand for them&s;elves; and feel in them|&s;elves

the ble&s;&s;ed and divine Sen&s;ations, of <HI>God in Chri&s;t reconciling them to him&s;elf</HI>; and ta&s;te of the Sweetne&s;s and Love of God, in turning from Darkne&s;s, from Ignorance, and evil Works; exhorting them to exerci&s;e tho&s;e noble Powers and Faculties of their Souls, under the Influence of the divine Spirit, in their own Hearts; whereby they may come to know the Will, Mind, and Law of God, to them&s;elves, and not p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n their Faith upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny Man, Councils or Synods of Men, but only upon the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Sacred Scripture,</HI> which proceeded from it.

<P>It was about 2400 Years after the Crea|tion of the World, before Mankind had any external written Law, for the Rule and Con|duct of their Lives, &s;o far as appears by either &s;acred or prophane Hi&s;tory; in all which Time Mankind, generally &s;peaking, had only for their Rule of Faith and Manners the <HI>exter|nal Creation</HI> as a Monitor to their outward Sen&s;es, for Evidence of the Reality and Cer|tainty
<PB N="8" REF="003985_0017_10036B6EC86959D0">
of the Exi&s;tence of the Supreme Being; and the <HI>internal Impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> God by his di|vine Spirit made upon the Capacities and Powers of their Souls, or inward Man; and perhaps &s;ome of them oral Traditions deliver|ed from Father to Son.</P>
<P>'The Love and Favour' (&s;ays the memo|rable <HI>John Hales</HI> in his Golden Remains pa. 1)
<Q>which it plea&s;ed God to bear our Fathers before the Law, &s;o far prevailed with him, as that without any Books and Writings, by familiar and friendly conver&s;|ing with them and communicating him&s;elf unto them, he made them receive and under|&s;tand his Laws: Their inward Conceits and intellectuals being after a wonderful Manner, as it were, <HI>figur'd</HI> and <HI>charecter'd</HI> (as St. <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> expre&s;&s;es it) by his Spirit, &s;o that they could not but &s;ee, and con&s;ent un|to, and confe&s;s the Truth of them. Which Way of Manife&s;ting his Will, unto many other gracious Priviledges which it had, above that which in after Ages came in Place of it, had this added, that it brought with it unto the Man, to whom it was made, a Pre&s;ervation again&s;t all Doubt and He&s;itancy, and a full A&s;&s;urance, both who the Author was, and how far his intent and Mean|ing reach'd.

And then, that the Light and Operation of each of the&s;e Spirits or Powers, mu&s;t needs al&s;o be of different Kinds and Natures, ac|cording to the Principles from which they flow, I think unavoidably follows.

<P>TO believe that God hath given us a Law to keep, which is either in its own Na|ture, or through Means of our Corruption, impo&s;&s;ible by &s;upernatural Aid to be kept; is to believe very prepo&s;terou&s;ly of God, and to ca&s;t a very high and di&s;honourable Reflection on his Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>To think that he hath given an impo&s;&s;ible Law to Mankind, is to think he hath given them no Law at all, becau&s;e &s;uch a Law can be no Law to rational Creatures. An impo&s;&s;ible Law is a Soleci&s;m, a Law that is impo&s;&s;ible to be kept, is no Law in it &s;elf, but mu&s;t be void from the Beginning; as being intirely con|trary to the Rea&s;on and Nature of Things.</P>
<P>To think that the Grace which is come unto us by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is not &s;ufficient to purifie, and rectifie our Natures, and enable us to keep his Laws, &s;ince 'twas for our <HI>Breach</HI> thereof

that he dyed, and made Atonement on the only and ab&s;olute Condition of our Repentance and Leading a new Life; is to think very unbecom|ingly of his great Undertaking, for us, and to render him no Saviour at all. For if he be not a Saviour from Sin, which is, and ever was the Cau&s;e of God's Wrath towards Men; his Di&s;plea&s;ure with them mu&s;t needs remain; &s;ince he is of more pure Eyes than to behold Ini|quity. The Holine&s;s of his Nature will not admit any unholy Creature to abide with him; And therefore as <HI>Adam</HI> when he broke the Law of God, and defiled his Heart, was driven from his holy Pre&s;ence; &s;o the Heart mu&s;t be clean|&s;ed and we mu&s;t return to Obedience to God's Law, before we can approach him, and enjoy his Delightful Pre&s;ence again.</P>
<P>For this End therefore, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, not from the Guilt of it only, but from the Act, from the Thing it &s;elf, and pu|rify to him&s;elf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 14.</NOTE>.

<P>For nothing can be more evident and plain, to a Soul entred into the paths of Virtue, than that God who hath begun this good Work in them, is able to carry it on effectually, and
