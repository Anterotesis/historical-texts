<P><HI>THIS excellent Book,</HI> The Fulfilling of the Scriptures, <HI>has long been a cele|brated Piece, and much read in a great Part of the Prote&s;tant World; as to &s;hould &s;eem by the numerous Editions of it, in various Countries. It found &s;uch Entertainment at its fir&s;t Publication, that quickly there was a new Impre&s;&s;ion</HI> [Anno 1671.] <HI>When the</HI> Author <HI>revis'd his Work, and made con&s;i|derable Enlargements in the Body of it (con&s;tantly di&s;tingui&s;hing tho&s;e</HI> Additions, <HI>with this Mark both before and after) and further added an</HI> Appen|dix, <HI>to lead us into &s;ome practical Reflections, and proper U&s;es of the whole.&mdash;It's from this Edition, with &s;uch Alterations and Improvements, that the pre&s;ent Impre&s;&s;ion is done.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Being de&s;ired to revi&s;e the Copy, before it went to the Pre&s;s, I found a Multitude of typographical</HI> Er|rata, <HI>which according to my be&s;t Skill I endeavour'd to amend; tho' upon a Review I ob&s;erve, &s;ome le&s;&s;er Mi&s;takes have e&s;caped the Printer's or my Correction, e&s;pecially in the Pointing, which &s;eems a little to cloud the Sen&s;e in &s;everal Places: but &s;uch Care has been us'd, that I hope no very great Errors have been committed in this Impre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>

<P>"Again&s;t his Will it came to be known, that his Book of the <HI>Fulfilling of the Scriptures</HI> was <HI>his.</HI> And by the divine Providence it was made ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that his latter Works &s;hould bear his Name. <HI>Ob&s;curity</HI> was his <HI>Ambition;</HI> though his Gifts and Graces prove too big and too bright to be covered.

It is truly a wonder how we can read and con&s;ider the Scripture, without wondring.&mdash;(2.) It is a great concernment, to know that the Scrip|ture

It much concerneth us, to know what an excellent <HI>key</HI> the Scripture is to unlock that &s;ealed book of <HI>providence;</HI> and that no other key can fit the &s;ame; many have tried a|nother way, but lo&s;t them&s;elves on the &s;earch, &amp; the more they attempt by human wi&s;dom, they became the more dark.

<HEAD>The Fulfilling OF THE SCRIPTURE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two Means by which the ble&s;&s;ed Maje&s;ty of GOD hath cho&s;en to reveal him&s;elf to the &s;ons of men, his WORD and his WORKS: which may be called the two great Lumi|naries, for giving Light to the Church, though the one be greater, I mean doth more clearly &s;hine forth, yea, doth communicate light to the other. The&s;e, men mu&s;t not divide, which by &s;o &s;trait a tye the Lord hath joined, and by a mar|vellous corre&s;pondence hath &s;et the one over again&s;t the other, that it may be ea&s;y to &s;ee his faithfulne&s;s, and the <HI>accompli&s;hment of the Scripture</HI> therein: and indeed this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a great concerning truth, that calleth for a &s;erious &s;tudy, the &s;olid per&s;wa&s;ion of which &s;hould afford a &s;weet ground of repo&s;e, and re&s;t for the &s;oul, though the earth were all in a combu&s;|tion round about, and give a &s;atisfying an&s;wer to our mo&s;t &s;ollicitous thoughts and fears. Now this this being the intended &s;ubject of the following di&s;|cour&s;e, I &s;hall fir&s;t touch it a little in the general, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> then hold forth &s;ome more particular grounds, whence it may be clearly demon&s;trated.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="005185_0037_1016B88092899EE8">
I. That the <HI>Scripture of God hath a certain Accom|pli&s;hment here in the World,</HI> and what is to be under|&s;tood by the &s;ame, I &s;hall endeavour to clear in the&s;e things, which would be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1. This is the very unfolding of the Lord's decree, and &s;ecret purpo&s;e, the bringing forth of his work, now within time, to the view of Angels and Men, which was before him in the deep of his thoughts, and Coun&s;el from eternity; it is an opening up of the &s;ealed Book, which we mu&s;t not under&s;tand to be that &s;ecret Roll of Election, and the Book of Life, wherein the Names of the Elect are writ; but <HI>Liber fatidicus,</HI> the &s;ealed Book of God's Di&s;pen&s;ations in the World, &s;hewing out his Coun&s;els, and De&s;igns, which &s;hould be brought forth in the After-ages of Time: for as the Lord did fully comprehend what he was to do, and all that was to befal his Church, and People from the Beginning to the End, long before there was a Be|ginning, before the Mountains were formed, &s;o hath he copied, and written out his Heart in the Word about the &s;ame, wherein he hath mo&s;t plainly &s;hewed forth, what were his ble&s;&s;ed Purpo&s;es, and Coun&s;el of old; and thus the Thoughts of his Heart, his Word and his Works do &s;weetly agree, and each one won|derfully an&s;wers to another. For his Work doth bring forth, and accompli&s;h his Word, that his Decree and Coun&s;el from all Eternity may take Place.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Scripture's Accompli&s;hment is the Tran&s;cript and Writing of it over in Providence: where we may &s;ee and admire how the Word doth &s;hine upon all the Paths and Foot&s;teps of the Lord toward his Church in every Age, and gives Light to the &s;ame, and what an evident Reflection his Work hath again upon the Word; &s;o that through the whole Series and Cour&s;e of Providence in the Earth, we have a mo&s;t exact Por|traiture, and Image of the Scripture, an&s;wering one to another as Face an&s;wers to Face in the gla&s;s, where
<PB N="3" REF="005185_0038_1016D96D1738B7A8">
it may be ea&s;y to di&s;cern the copy by the principal, and that Re&s;emblance which is betwixt the Building, and that excellent pattern, and Model, which is held forth thereof in the Word.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Accompli&s;hment of the Scripture is the very turning that, which was the Object of our Faith and Contemplation, to be the Object of our Sen&s;e and Feel|ing: it is the real Birth, and bringing forth the&s;e Truths unto the World in their appointed Time and &s;ea|&s;on concerning the Church, and particular Chri&s;ti|ans, which were hid in that Womb of the promi&s;e, and many dark Predictions of the Word; it is &s;uch a Thing as giveth the Promi&s;es and Prophecies, a vi|&s;ible Being, yea bringeth Truth &s;o near within the Reach of our Sen&s;es, that we may even touch, as it were, and handle the Words of Life. O what an excellent In|terpreter is Experience! <HI>Ta&s;te and &s;ee:</HI> for thus the &s;e|rious Chri&s;tian getteth a View of the Scripture, and &s;piritual Things, which the mo&s;t &s;ubtil, and piercing Eye of un&s;anctified Schoolmen cannot reach, yea, by the Practice of Truth, Nearne&s;s to God, and retiring of the Soul to him, hath oft got more Light in an Hour, than others by many Days putting their Judgement and Invention upon the Rack.</P>
<P N="4">4. This is God's own Seal, which he putteth to the Word to confirm and ratify the &s;ame; I do not only mean that &s;ecret Seal of the Spirit within, but &s;ome|thing more external, that &s;olemn Te&s;timony of his Works, whereby he doth every Day appeal to Men's Con&s;ciences about his Truth: for his Works are very manife&s;t, whereon there is &s;o clear an ingraving of his Truth and Faithfulne&s;s, that as the Impre&s;s and Image of the &s;eal is upon the wax, men may al&s;o &s;ee who&s;e &s;uper&s;cription and image that is, which doth appear on &s;uch, and &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages of providence.</P>
<P N="5">5. This is &s;omething we are not to &s;eek only in the extraordinary acts of providence, or in any &s;ingular
<PB N="4" REF="005185_0039_1016D9252893D910">
and eminent path of a Chri&s;tian's experience; nay, it doth &s;hine forth in the &s;malle&s;t and mo&s;t ca&s;ual things that fall out, yea in every Page of that great Volume of Providence may it be clearly read.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Scripture's accompli&s;hment is &s;uch a thing as concerns every Chri&s;tian in his per&s;onal ca&s;e; to which his ordinary experience doth relate; whereof &s;uch have a large regi&s;ter, what of the Word hath been certainly proved in the &s;everal &s;teps and changes of their life, who&s;e practice doth much lie betwixt im|provement of the Word, and ob&s;ervation how it is fulfilled: &s;uch can witne&s;s, how under a &s;piritual decay to be carnally minded is death, and when its well, what great peace they have who love God's Law: they have oft found, that in a &s;trait he is a very pre&s;ent help, and in the way of duty that it's &s;urely good to draw near to him; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the clo&s;e of their life, can from many remarkable and convincing providences de|clare the truth, and faithfulne&s;s of God. And truly whil&s;t I &s;peak here, of the Chri&s;tian's experience, I think it's &s;ad, and a great &s;hort-coming, that there is not a more &s;erious improvement of it for this end: which is a very concerning duty on &s;uch who have ta&s;ted that the Lord is gracious, and O what an excel|lent addition would this be to their will or te&s;tament, when they are to leave the World, to leave a te&s;timony behind them to the faithfulne&s;s of God in his Word and promi&s;e, and thus put their &s;eal to the &s;ame, from what they have oft proved by &s;ure experience! For this &s;hould prove a &s;ingular help to &s;trengthen others, and &s;pread abroad the fame and good report of reli|gion: yea, thus one generation &s;hould declare the works of the Lord to another, and tran&s;mit the memo|ry of his goodne&s;s to &s;ucceeding ages.</P>
<P N="7">7. This is &s;omething which not only the Chri&s;tian's experience doth witne&s;s, and in every time taketh place but hath al&s;o a peculiar reference to tho&s;e ages, and
<PB N="5" REF="005185_0040_1016D9700E779D00">
periods of times, wherein &s;uch particular truths &s;hould have their accompli&s;hment. For its true, that the Prophets of old did not only in their predictions hold forth in general, the truth and certainty of tho&s;e things, which &s;hould fall out: but they al&s;o in|quired and &s;earched diligently about the time; to what or what manner of time the Spirit by them did point. I <HI>Pet.</HI> I. II.&mdash;For 'tis truly clear, that a piece of the Word was under the Law to have its peculiar ac|compli&s;hment; that part of it al&s;o under the Me&s;&s;ia's Kingdom, in the days of the go&s;pel &s;hould be ful|filled, and we find a very concerning part thereof be|longs to the&s;e latter times. And there is betwixt &s;uch periods of time and revolution of the Church's ca&s;e, and the bringing forth of &s;uch a piece of the Scripture to a performance, a very certain and undoubted connec|tion. 'Tis true, we do not yet well under&s;tand (which will be one of the la&s;t manife&s;tations the Church &s;hall have, at the end of time, when the my&s;tery of God is fini&s;hed) how to &s;ort the event exactly to the Word: but it is &s;ure (and were worthy of our &s;tudy and ob|&s;ervation) how every age hath &s;omething of the Scrip|ture peculiar thereto, yea carrieth forward the Lord's work and de&s;ign a further &s;tep. May we not &s;ee how one age fulfilleth &s;uch a piece of the Church's &s;uffer|ings appointed for her, and puts &s;ome great trial and &s;ad per&s;ecution over her head, which &s;he was to meet with; whil&s;t another age carrieth he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> thorow an other change, and giveth her a time of re&s;t and breath|ing? How &s;uch a time bringeth Antichri&s;t forward to his height, and &s;uch a following age begins the turn of the Church's ca&s;e? Yea, every &s;everal period and revolution of time, &s;till addeth &s;omething, to that excel|lent hi&s;tory of the Word and Providence, which we have &s;ince the beginning, and bringeth forth &s;omething further into the world, of the Lord's coun&s;el and de&s;ign about his Church.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="6" REF="005185_0041_1016D92AECA5DAF8">
8. The accompli&s;hing of the Scripture is &s;uch a thing, we are to look after, in a &s;pecial way here, which concerns this militant and traveling condi|tion of the Church: for if the Scriptures were once fully accompli&s;hed, and the great my&s;tery of God therein fini&s;hed, there were then nothing more to do, his work of providence were at an end, and time &s;hould be no more. This is &s;omething, that is not here perfected at once, but is &s;till gradually car|rying on, and then &s;hall be compleat at the re&s;urrec|tion of the ju&s;t, and &s;econd coming of the Lord, which is the la&s;t part of Canonical Scripture to be made out, when both his work and his word, and time, &s;hall be all fini&s;hed together; but while the &s;aints are yet by the way, they have the written word and all tho&s;e precious promi&s;es therein, for pre&s;ent u&s;e and encouragement. For that is its proper work, to take them &s;afe thorow this labyrinth of the world, and when it hath brought them to land, it hath no more to do; there will be then no more need for a Chri&s;tian to go to a promi&s;e, and adventure upon it; we &s;hall then no more watch, with the watchmen in a dark and &s;tormy night, and hope for the breaking of the day: faith then &s;hall not be at a &s;tand, how &s;uch a word &s;hall be made out, becau&s;e of invincible diffi|culties in its way; no, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> it hath done its work, and that which is written &s;hall be &s;wallowed up, in that which is &s;een and enjoyed, all the &s;treams of our encouragement will then lo&s;e them&s;elves in a greater depth. O then its fini&s;hed and done, what all the pro|mi&s;es, prophe&s;ies, and threatnings of the Word were bringing forth: and then no more need of &s;omething as a pledge and earne&s;t in hand, to them who have the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the inheritance, &amp; under who&s;e feet the God of peace hath trod Satan and all their ene|mies.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="7" REF="005185_0042_1016D9739782F390">
9. I &s;hall add this, the accompli&s;hment of the Scripture is &s;omething, which is not only demon|&s;trated to a Chri&s;tian by &s;en&s;ible influences, and God's &s;ecret working with his Spirit, but is made out to the ob&s;ervation of men, in the way of providence; and not only witne&s;&s;ed by that internal evidence of the Spirit, but by an external te&s;timony, which both ra|tionally holdeth this out to the judgment, and &s;en|&s;ibly to the &s;ight and experience: and this is the &s;tron|ge&s;t and mo&s;t full of all outward evidences, &s;ince the world mu&s;t &s;hut their eyes if they do not &s;ee it, and a Chri&s;tian mu&s;t deny what he both &s;eeth and feeleth, if he deny a witne&s;s to this.</P>
<P>II. We would con&s;ider the <HI>accompli&s;hment of the Scripture,</HI> as that which <HI>is the Lord's peculiar work and de&s;ign in the World,</HI> and that great bu&s;ine&s;s which is upon the wheels of providence amid&s;t the various changes and revolutions, which are here within time, for bringing about whereof the ble&s;&s;ed thoughts of his heart are fixed and unalterable. This is indeed a grave and &s;erious truth, worthy to be more noticed and laid to heart by men, that the glorious providence of God, which goeth throughout the earth, and doth particularly reach all things which come to pa&s;s, the &s;malle&s;t as well as the greate&s;t intere&s;ts of men, in all the&s;e doth move certainly and infallibly for the ac|compli&s;hing of the Scripture, which is that great thing God hath before his eyes: for it is no per&s;onal intere&s;ts of men, how great &s;o ever they be, that can an&s;wer this end; it is &s;omething beyond the &s;etting up of Kings, or overturning Kingdoms and Nations, that he doth mind amid&s;t the&s;e various changes, which are in the World; 'tis &s;ome greater thing, than that which we mo&s;t notice, the Lord thereby de&s;igns, how &s;uch a party is advanced, and others brought low, for the&s;e things come within the reach of his care and
<PB N="8" REF="005185_0043_1016D92C812D6FF8">
providence, in &s;o far as the fulfilling of the Scripture is therein concerned,&mdash;the outmaking of the promi&s;es, and threatnings: one &s;yllable whereof he doth more va|lue than all the Crowns and Kingdoms of the earth, yea will not let it fall to the ground, tho' it &s;hould be at the rate of laying cities and countries de&s;olate. For it's in this the Lord taketh plea&s;ure, and exerci&s;eth his ble&s;&s;ed tho'ts, even the bringing about what he hath &s;poken in his Word.</P>
<P>Now to clear this further, I &s;hall hold forth the&s;e following grounds, whence it may appear.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The fulfilling of the Scripture, or written Word, is &s;o great a thing, and of &s;uch Concernment, that the ble&s;&s;ed Maje&s;ty of God thought it worthy of a place in his heart from all eternity. This was be|fore him in his thoughts and coun&s;els of old; even that marvellous work, which &s;hould be the after-product, and outmaking of his Word to his Church here within time, and &s;urely was &s;uch a plot and contrivance, that as no le&s;s than infinite love, wi&s;dom and power, were required to bring it about, &s;o it was well becoming the Maje&s;ty of God, and worthy to be the work of all the three ble&s;&s;ed per&s;ons of the Trinity. O if we could go down a little into this deep, and &s;ee the won|ders that are there, we &s;hould find, that knowledge which u&s;ually le&s;&s;eneth our admiration of other things, would heighten it here: it would be new to us every day to think how great and marvelous a thing that is which the Word is bringing forth.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is upon this, even the Performance of the Word, that the pre&s;ent encouragement, and future ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the &s;aints doth lie. For the great intere&s;t of the Church is adventured upon the Word, and em|barked with it, which would be lo&s;t; yea their &s;tock and trea&s;ure which is laid up in heaven, and all that a Chri&s;tian is worth, which is laid up in the promi&s;e, were then peri&s;hed,&mdash;if the Scripture &s;hould want an
<PB N="9" REF="005185_0044_1016D9782D301998">
accompli&s;hment: the godly man hath then run and la|boured in vain, and tho&s;e who are fallen a&s;leep in Chri&s;t, have died in a &s;ad delu&s;ion: providence would be like the work of the fooli&s;h builder, who begun and knew not how to fini&s;h. O how highly then is the Lord concerned in fulfilling of his Word? That he may perfect what concerns his people, and having &s;urely paid the price put them al&s;o in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is yet more than the intere&s;ts of Angels and men, yea than heaven and earth is worth, that de|pends upon the outmaking of the Scripture; the glory of God, and e&s;pecially the prai&s;e of that great attribute his <HI>faithfulne&s;s,</HI> which he will have no le&s;s &s;hine forth in the performance of his Word, than his power and wi&s;dom in this great fabrick of the univer&s;e, and the&s;e marvellous productions of nature. For he hath magnified his Word above all his works: therefore is his heart greatly &s;et upon this, even the bringing to pa&s;s what he hath &s;poken; which if in the lea&s;t &s;hould fail, this were no le&s;s than to make God a liar, and fal|&s;ify his Word, who is through all the Church known by this ble&s;&s;ed name, <HI>The God of truth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. We &s;hould con&s;ider this, as that great tru&s;t, which is put in his hand who only in heaven and earth was found worthy to open the Book of God's decrees and coun&s;els, and loo&s;e the &s;eals thereof: a tru&s;t, which the Lord did not adventure upon the Angels, the &s;malle&s;t promi&s;e being &s;uch as requires no le&s;s than an omnipotent power and the arm of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> to bring it about. For which end, he whom the Father hath anointed, is gone forth as a mighty man who rejoic|eth to run his race, that he may perform his Word, and execute this great de&s;ign in the admini&s;tration of providence, about his Church and People; which he will not cea&s;e or give over, until the my&s;tery of God in the Scripture, and all that was &s;poken by the Pro|phets, be put to a clo&s;e, when Heaven and Earth at the
<PB N="10" REF="005185_0045_1016D92F99D25DE8">
pouring out of the la&s;t vial, &s;hall give that &s;olemn &s;hout and exclamation, <HI>It is fini&s;hed, it is fini&s;hed.</HI> O if this were once fully perfect, there would be no more to do; then the Winter were pa&s;t, and the Summer come, the &s;ong of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Lamb &s;hould be heard, becau&s;e the bride hath made her &s;elf ready, then let all the trees of the wood rejoice, the hills break forth into &s;inging, and all that is therein be glad, becau&s;e the Scripture and the great de&s;ign thereof is fully fini&s;hed, and the day of the perfect liberty of the Sons of God is come.</P>
<P N="5">5. The accompli&s;hment of the Scripture is of &s;uch concernment, that nothing can be done until it be once fini&s;hed. For this, time mu&s;t wait, the Sun mu&s;t keep its cour&s;e, and the ordinances of the Heaven continue as they are: the World is but a &s;caffold until this build|ing be perfected; for this the grave doth &s;till retain her pri&s;oners, and the du&s;t of the Saints mu&s;t yet re&s;t in hope, the creation &s;till groaneth, and the marriage-&s;upper of the Lamb is deferred, the cry of the &s;ouls under the altar get not a full return, until all that is written in the Word be fullfilled.</P>
<P N="6">6. We would con&s;ider, this is the great thing which the Lord this day is carrying on, even the accompli&s;h|ment of his Word. For this is mo&s;t brought upon de|bate, of any thing be&s;ides; the World challengeth it, and the hearts of the godly do oft call it in que&s;tion; the Athei&s;t &s;coffs at it, and &s;ayeth, Where is the pro|mi&s;e of his coming? There are often to appearance in|&s;uperable difficulties in the way of its performance: therefore doth the Maje&s;ty of God &s;o much concern him&s;elf in this, for bringing about of which he is in a holy way re&s;tle&s;s, and providence in an unce&s;&s;ant mo|tion, until he hath done that which he hath &s;poken in his Word. It was for this cau&s;e (that the Scripture might be accompli&s;hed) that the Word was made fle&s;h, and he who counted it no robbery to be equal with
<PB N="11" REF="005185_0046_1016D979C2166898">
God, did take upon him&s;elf the form of a &s;ervant. This is of &s;uch account in his eyes, that what time he &s;peaks concerning a Nation or People, ere it come not to pa&s;s, he will rather put forth omnipotency, for the working of miracles, and change the very cour&s;e of nature: for this, he will make the deep dry, make a way through the red Sea, and cau&s;e <HI>Jordan</HI> to &s;tand as in heaps, that he may keep promi&s;e to his People; if there be no way for bringing about his Word, but through a Sea of blood, and over the bones and carca&s;&s;es of his enemies, he will do it, and bring it to pa&s;s, though Walled Cities, and the Sons of <HI>Anak</HI> mighty and &s;trong, &s;hould &s;tand in the way thereof. <HI>Abraham</HI>'s old age, and <HI>Sarah</HI>'s dead womb, mu&s;t not fru&s;trate this: if the promi&s;e of the Church's re&s;toration cannot be made out without a wonder &s;hewed upon dry bones &s;cattered at the graves mouth, this &s;hall not be wanting; when God &s;aith, he'll bring down the enemies of his Church, if the du&s;t of the ground &s;hould ari&s;e, down they mu&s;t come. How many great de&s;igns of men hath this ble&s;&s;ed de&s;ign (that the coun&s;el of the Lord may &s;tand) cru&s;hed and brok|en? &s;o that their work and coun&s;el hath been as the Spider's web, when it &s;tood cro&s;s to this end. The god|ly need not fear, that he be not a pre&s;ent help in time of trouble: for he will keep his word herein, though the Earth &s;hould be overturned, and the Mountains ca&s;t into the mid&s;t of the Sea. O who hath re&s;i&s;ted his coun&s;el! What are all the&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes and changes here in the World, but making way for the Scripture's accompli&s;hment? With what de&s;ire doth he move to|wards this end? So that as in <HI>Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">chary</HI> 6. 8. the in|&s;truments by him appointed for executing his judg|ment and the threatinings of the Word, it's &s;aid, they have quieted his Spirit, his decrees are mountains of bra&s;s, which are unchangeable; the thoughts of his heart take place in all generations: therefore the Word
<PB N="12" REF="005185_0047_1016D931BA3371D0">
which is gone forth out of his mouth, &s;hall not return empty, but the plea&s;ure of the Lord &s;hall pro&s;per in his hand.</P>
<P>III. <HI>The accompli&s;hment of the Scripture is a truth very clear and manife&s;t,</HI> whereof none can pretend igno|rance, if they do not &s;hut their eyes, and force their own light, from the fear of &s;uch a di&s;covery. For the ob&s;truction doth not lie in the darkne&s;s of the object, or that men cannot &s;ee this; &s;ince we have it &s;o clearly held forth in great and legible characters: nay, we mu&s;t &s;ay, the cau&s;e is culpable, there is much of the will in it, which renders &s;uch an ignorance without excu&s;e. O that this &s;hould be &s;o little lookt after, a matter of &s;uch near and weighty concernment, when there needs not an other demon&s;tration, but <HI>come and &s;ee</HI> the works of the Lord through the earth! For he hath here &s;o far conde&s;cended to his People, as to bring the truth near, that they even feel and handle the &s;ame: yea, he doth in a manner &s;ay to every one as to <HI>Thomas, put in your bands,</HI> touch the Word, and truth thereof, and be no longer faithle&s;s, but ta&s;te and &s;ee, that the Lord is good, and that he is true in what he hath &s;poken.</P>
<P>We are indeed to look for a more clear and full di&s;covery of this truth, the nearer the Church is to the end of time. There is a labyrinth, as it were, of turnings and windings, through which we may &s;ee the Word oft brought, &s;o as we lo&s;e &s;ight thereof, and are ready to &s;tagger about its performance: but it's as true, that the mo&s;t eminent confirmations, the &s;aints ever had of this truth, have been after greate&s;t &s;hakings there|about. Yea, the Lord hath in all ages, &s;o vi&s;ibly &s;ealed his Word by its performance, that we may &s;ay, can he be a Chri&s;tian and a &s;tranger to this in his experience! or a &s;erious on-looker on providence and the di&s;pen|&s;ations of the time, wherein he lives, and a &s;tranger to it, in his ob&s;ervation! yea, can any be &s;o wholly
<PB N="13" REF="005185_0048_1016D97D18A641C8">
bruti&s;h, as not to di&s;cern a thing &s;o clear that oft-times tho&s;e who run, may read?</P>
<P>But to &s;peak a little more to this, I &s;hall here point at &s;ome things, that may &s;hew how manife&s;t this truth is.</P>
<P N="1">1. Is it not very clear, which we &s;ee every day brings to light? A truth &s;o con&s;picuous, both in God's ordinary way with his Church, and in the &s;everal &s;teps and pa&s;&s;ages of a Chri&s;tian's life! For the&s;e mercies which bring the Word and promi&s;e to pa&s;s, are new every morning, and cry aloud, if we could hear, great is his faithfulne&s;s. This is indeed tried: and needs there more, to convince a blind man, that his &s;ight is re&s;tored to him, but that he certainly &s;eeth? &s;ure they never wanted confirmations here, who do but &s;eri|ou&s;ly &s;eek to be comfirmed.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is it not a clear truth, which not only is found upon the exacte&s;t tryal; but is witne&s;sed by &s;uch who ever tryed it in their mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing &s;traits, and extre|mity? for it's in the darke&s;t night this truth hath mo&s;t brightly &s;hined: and the&s;e more remarkable ventu|rous acts of faith, have they not &s;till brought forth mo&s;t convincing experiments of this truth? We may &s;ay, there is none can give a better account of the performance of the Word, then tho&s;e who again&s;t hope, have believed in hope, that this never made them a&s;hamed.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is it not al&s;o clear, whereof there are &s;uch &s;o|lemn extraordinary confirmations in all ages? For that his name is near, his wondrous works declare. I am &s;ure, no time could ever deny its witne&s;s, how by great convincing providences, both of judgment and mercy, it hath been &s;o &s;ealed, as hath forced Athei&s;ts to keep Silence: no time, wherein the Church had not cau&s;e to erect a pillar, and engrave thereon, <HI>We have &s;een with our eyes</HI> the great and wondrous works of the
<PB N="14" REF="005185_0049_1016D9808C0A4680">
Lord, by which he hath witne&s;sed the truth of his Word.</P>
<P N="4">4. Is it not a manife&s;t truth, which even in the mo&s;t &s;trange, and dark foot&s;teps of providence, &s;o clearly &s;hineth forth? The&s;e, which at the fir&s;t look are an a&s;toni&s;hment, and hard to be under&s;tood, yet after mo&s;t clearly verify the Scripture; that whil&s;t the Lord's way goeth out of our &s;ight, yea, out of the ordinary road of his working, through a labyrinth of turnings, and cro&s;s di&s;pen&s;ations, yet at length it doth evidently clear, and di&s;intangle it &s;elf, which men may oft &s;ee break forth as the &s;un out of a dark cloud, that &s;hineth the more brightly, the more at was ob&s;cured.</P>
<P N="5">5. Is it not very clear, which can be demon&s;trated by &s;uch vi&s;ible effects in the&s;e great changes of the World? For the fulfilling of the Scripture is not a thing hid in a corner, but oft publi&s;hed in the hou&s;e|tops, that men may &s;ee legibly written, upon King|doms and Nations, the de&s;olate ruins, and deva&s;ta|tion of cities and hou&s;es great and fair, which are made to be without inhabitants, &s;o as tho&s;e who go by may clearly read the cau&s;e, and bear that witne&s;s, <HI>Lo, there is fin vi&s;ibly puni&s;hed according to the Word.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. How clear is this, which we have &s;o evidently drawn out, and acted over in a Chri&s;tian walk? For what el&s;e is the &s;piritual conver&s;ation of &s;uch, tho&s;e vi&s;ible effects and evidences of the grace of God all along a Chri&s;tian's way, but a vi&s;ible convincing wit|ne&s;s to the performance of the word? Have not &s;uch a very audible Echo and re&s;ound to that which is the great drift and Scope of the Scripture? where men may &s;ee the Bible turned over into a practical hi&s;tory, written forth, and acted on the heart, and conver|&s;ation of the &s;aints, as on a &s;tage, or theatre: the Word living, &s;peaking, moving, and clearly diffu&s;ing it &s;elf through all the veins, as it were, and conduits
<PB N="15" REF="005185_0050_1016D9CF7A6DAC10">
of a Chri&s;tian's life; &s;o that if the truth, and reality of the grace of God be a thing manife&s;t, and unque&s;tio|nable, we mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ee therein the real performance of the Scripture.</P>
<P N="7">7. I &s;hall add, we may clearly &s;ee how one piece of the Scripture is nothing el&s;e but the punctual ful|filling, and accompli&s;hment of the other: how that which was &s;hadowed out by dark types, under the Law, and held in a Prophecy, through the Old Te&s;|tament, is written before our eyes in a plain, and real hi&s;tory in the New Te&s;tament, and that the go&s;|pel is only a fulfilling of the Law and the Prophets.</P>
<P>IV. Though it is very manife&s;t, and by undeniable proofs can be demon&s;trated, that the Scripture hath a real accompli&s;hment, and doth certainly take place, in the con&s;tant cour&s;e of providence here in the World, that I am &s;ure if men do not darken them|&s;elves they can be no &s;trangers to &s;uch a thing; yet we mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>This truth which mo&s;t nearly concerns us, is to the mo&s;t of men,</HI> (even &s;uch who &s;eem to give a large a&s;&s;ent to the Word) <HI>a my&s;tery and dark riddle.</HI> There are few who do but enquire if there be &s;uch a thing, if the promi&s;es and threatnings have indeed a certain outmaking: few do &s;eriou&s;ly ponder the providences of God, in which the truth and faithfulne&s;s of the Word &s;hineth forth, that they may thereby be fur|ther confirmed we &s;ee that to many (alas too many) the great concernments of the Law and ever|la&s;ting happine&s;s are a trivial and an impertinent bu&s;i|ne&s;s: this is a truth the World doth pa&s;s without regarding: &s;uch as &s;port at Religion, when they come to earne&s;t here, dare not &s;tand before this di&s;covery; it concerneth them much to reconcile their principles with their practice, their fear begetteth hatred, and both put their wit and invention on the rack, how to di&s;pute away any remainder of a con&s;cience, to im|pri&s;on
<PB N="16" REF="005185_0051_1016D984AA0074E8">
their light, and under the pretext of rea&s;on, run down godline&s;s, and the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity there|of: yea, be&s;ides, doth not &s;en&s;uality, wherein many wallow, and &s;teep them&s;elves, &s;o dull and drown the &s;oul, put &s;uch an interpo&s;ition of the Earth betwixt them, and this truth, as wholly darkens it? And, oh, how &s;ad, that many having a large profe&s;&s;ion to be Chri&s;tians, &s;carce ever knew what it is to put the Word to an e&s;&s;ay and trial, in the concernments of their life; to have their light followed with experi|ence, wherein the very truth and reality of Reli|gion lieth.</P>
<P>To clear this, I &s;hall hold forth &s;ome things, which may &s;hew how little this truth of the Scrip|ture's accompli&s;hment is known, or &s;tudied by the mo&s;t of men.</P>
<P N="1">1. The abounding of &s;o much Athei&s;m, that there are many who not only di&s;claim the practice of that Religion they &s;eem to profe&s;s, but do &s;tate them|&s;elves in mo&s;t direct oppo&s;ition to the rules and principles thereof; the&s;e to whom the Scripture is but as a Romance, yea, who do only conver&s;e there|with to prove their wit and parts in impugning the &s;ame; who avowedly mock at the judgments, and providences of God; I confe&s;s the&s;e may be reck|oned Mon&s;ters, a very prodigy in the time, wherein they live; though, alas, it is not the lea&s;t part of the World! and which is &s;trange! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the mo&s;t hor|rid Athie&s;ts do u&s;ually abound where the light of the Go&s;pel hath mo&s;t &s;hined: the &s;avage places of the Earth bring forth no &s;uch mon&s;trous births, as are hatcht within the vi&s;ible Church; for thus the judg|ment of God putteth a blacker dye on them than o|thers. O what a terrible &s;ound would the fulfilling of the Scripture have in men's ears, if they once came to have &s;erious thoughts thereof; &s;ince they cannot admit this, but they mu&s;t certainly read their
<PB N="17" REF="005185_0052_1016D9D10FE47B40">
own &s;entence of death, which a few days &s;hall put in execution; and if the Scripture be true, they are then un&s;peakably mi&s;erable!</P>
<P N="2">2. That indifferency which we &s;ee among&s;t men about Religion, and the mo&s;t concerning truths of &s;cripture, doth &s;hew how little this is known or laid to heart: whence, there is &s;uch a generation who do not profe&s;&s;edly deny the &s;cripture, yet can turn it over in a &s;chool-problem, and wonder that men &s;hould ingage &s;o far upon it. It is not that it is hid from them, but they truly chu&s;e to hide them&s;elves from it; as more &s;uiting that intere&s;t they drive, that the truth of God &s;hould be rather a matter of opinion than of faith, a thing which they would di&s;pute, but not believe. But, O, what other thoughts would a clear &s;ight of this, cau&s;e,&mdash;That within &s;o few days the truths and threatnings of the Word &s;hall be &s;ad ear|ne&s;t; the fulfilling whereof no &s;harpne&s;s of wit, nor &s;ubtil arguments, will be able to evade!</P>
<P N="3">3. That there is &s;o much barren theory of Divine truths in the world, with &s;o little &s;erious Chri&s;tian diligence, doth it not &s;adly witne&s;s how &s;mall ac|quaintance men have with this truth? Whence, we &s;ee &s;o great a part of tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;edly acknowledge the word, and are daily conver&s;ing with it, yet can give no other account thereof, but report; &s;o many that can &s;atisfyingly di&s;cour&s;e of the Scripture, could never put their &s;eal to it, that <HI>God is true therein.</HI> Whence are &s;o many great School-divines, and able Mini|&s;ters for parts, &s;uch vi&s;ible Athei&s;ts in their way, and practice? Is it not, they really judge Divinity and Religion, rather a &s;cience, and matter of &s;pecula|tion, than a matter of &s;en&s;e and feeling, which men &s;hould more live than &s;peak, and cannot be known without experience, the true end of knowledge? But, O this cannot be found in books, men will not meet with it in a throng of choice&s;t notions, it

confoundeth the wi&s;e, and the di&s;puter of this world, whil&s;t the meane&s;t and mo&s;t &s;imple Chri&s;tian of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> knoweth more than tho&s;e of greate&s;t parts.</P>
<P N="4">4. The great Hypocri&s;y which is in the world, I mean within the vi&s;ible Church, doth too clearly &s;hew, that this truth is little thought on, or laid to heart. For what is that fal&s;e &s;hew, and appearance (which we may &s;ay is not a &s;in, but the very &s;inful|ne&s;s of &s;in) Is it not the height of Athei&s;m? And a real contradiction in their practice, to this, that the Scripture of God is true, and will have an unque&s;ti|onable accompli&s;hment? O could any be &s;o mon|&s;trou&s;ly irrational, to drive this poor plot, how to appear that which they are not, to be at &s;uch pain to act the part hand&s;omely of a &s;erious Chri&s;tian, to per&s;onate his tears, and grief, his &s;piritual frame, his zeal for God, if he did think gravely on this truth, and did believe the threatnings of the Word; that they will &s;urely take place and be within a little while no complement, but &s;ad earne&s;t, &amp; that he is every hour &s;tanding under that Scripture-wo again&s;t Hypo|crites? I am &s;ure it would make his very hair &s;tand upright, his joynts loo&s;e, and his thighs &s;mite upon one another, could he but &s;eriou&s;ly think upon this.</P>
<P N="5">5. Tho&s;e unwarrantable ways which in a time of trial men take for their e&s;cape, may witne&s;s this, that the word they do not judge a &s;ure ground to venture on. Whence is there &s;uch he&s;itation in &s;uffering times? From that day many taking their leave of Chri&s;t, who have rather cho&s;en &s;in than affliction?

What meaneth the&s;e di&s;tru&s;t|ful fears, and perplexed complaints? If their eyes be but open to know they have &s;uch a well as the promi&s;e of God, at their hand, how is it that the &s;malle&s;t &s;traits are &s;o puzling, and ready to out|wit them, that they &s;o u&s;ually &s;tumble at the cro&s;s?

<P>Now from the&s;e things may it not appear, that this grave truth of the Scripture's accompli&s;hment is but little known, or &s;tudied? I confe&s;s, we may think on it with a&s;toni&s;hment, how a matter &s;o nearly concer|ning us is not more our work! there are indeed many things worthy to be known, but our &s;hort life can &s;carce allow time, or give lea&s;ure for the &s;tudy there|of. But O this, though we had only two days to live, I think might require the one, to be &s;ure and per|&s;waded about the truth of that whereon our hea|ven and eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s lieth, and on which we mu&s;t lay our la&s;t Hold, when we are in the pa&s;&s;age at

<P N="1">1. That there is &s;uch a thing as the very Word and Te&s;timony of God this day upon record, where|with we have &s;o much to do, which doth offer it&s;elf to men's trial, and exacte&s;t &s;earch; and yet we put it &s;o little to that touch&s;tone, that we may know it upon an other account, than report or hear|&s;ay.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. How can men render to others a rea&s;on of their hope, when it is enquired, who did never a&s;k a rea&s;on of this at them&s;elves? or will tho&s;e &s;eal the truth with their blood, who never had it &s;ealed upon their heart by experience?</P>
<P N="4">4. Whence is it that men can have comfort in Scripture, who are not well grounded in the faith there|of?

<P N="6">6. May it not &s;eem &s;trange, that men can believe a certain performance of the Word and promi&s;es, and not be more deeply affected therewith?

<P N="7">7. I would add, if this be indeed the Scripture of God, which &s;urely hath an accompli&s;hment, O how is it we are &s;o little Chri&s;tians?

is the greate&s;t; but it's &s;trange to think what a ge|neration there is, who can &s;port at the Scripture, and que&s;tion the truth thereof! who yet did never once &s;e|riou&s;ly enquire if &s;uch a thing be true, el&s;e &s;o clear a witne&s;s might &s;tare them in the face. Such a party we &s;hould look on with compa&s;&s;ion. It's al&s;o &s;ad to think at how poor a rate, far below their allowance, many of the Saints do here live, becau&s;e there is &s;o little of that excellent and more noble Spirit, to &s;earch the Scripture for their further comfort and e&s;tabli&s;hment thereby.</P>
<P>It is true, this ble&s;&s;ed record doth bear witne&s;s to it &s;elf, and is known by its own light: whereon there is &s;uch a vi&s;ible impre&s;s of the glorious God, &s;uch convincing marks of its true de&s;cent, as may throughly &s;hew who&s;e it is, and how far it exceeds all human invention; and thus by a clear manife&s;ta|tion of the truth, doth commend it &s;elf to men's con|&s;ciences, as a &s;afe ground whereon they may repo&s;e their &s;oul. It is al&s;o clear, how wonderfully the Scripture hath been pre&s;erved, and the original copies thereof kept through all ages, that what ever &s;mall variation there may appear as to &s;ome <HI>Apiculi,</HI> which in &s;ome places hath cau&s;ed diver&s;e readings, yet in any nece&s;&s;ary, or &s;aving truth, the greate&s;t Criticks will confe&s;s they do not in the lea&s;t vary: and it is known (wherein we are to adore that &s;pecial provi|dence of God) that the Jewi&s;h Church, to whom this &s;acred <HI>depo&s;itum</HI> was delivered, did with &s;uch exact and &s;ingular care look to the &s;ame, even in the lea&s;t tittle, or letter thereof; this being the great work and &s;tudy of the Mazorites, from one age to an|other, to &s;ee to the pre&s;erving of that great record, from being in the lea&s;t vitiated or corrupted; and the greate&s;t adver&s;aries of the truth cannot po&s;&s;ibly deny that agreement betwixt tho&s;e many original copies, in the whole &s;ub&s;tance, which may be very convin|cing
<PB N="23" REF="005185_0058_1016D9DCD0D36F20">
to the World. And do not men &s;ee, how marvel|ous the whole frame of the Scripture is? What a corre&s;pondency betwixt all the parts thereof, that no|thing in it doth in the lea&s;t vitiate the proportion and beauty of the work, but it has all along an evident ten|dency to advance holine&s;s &amp; conform the &s;oul to God. With a wonderful con&s;ent and harmony in an&s;wering to this great end, we &s;ee the &s;implicity, and plainne&s;s of its &s;tyle, yet backt with a convincing Maje&s;ty, and authority upon the con&s;cience; yea, be&s;ides, it hath been atte&s;ted by miracles, that were great in them|&s;elves, famous in their time, tran&s;mitted to the Church in after-ages, with unan&s;werable evidences of their truth; that not only the witne&s;s of the Word, but other pre&s;&s;ing and rational grounds may let us &s;ee there could be no deceit, or impo&s;ture therein.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a great te&s;timony to the truth: but I may &s;ay on very &s;ure ground, that, next to that great wit|ne&s;s of the Spirit, there is no argument more convin|cing to reach Athei&s;m a &s;troke, and throughly &s;atis|fy an exerci&s;ed &s;pirit, who may be plunged about this great thing, the authority of the Scripture, than a clear di&s;covery of its performance whil&s;t under the a&s;&s;ault of &s;uch a temptation: if this be the very word of God, they may but retire within, &amp; then turn their eyes abroad in the World, to &s;ee what a vi&s;ible im|pre&s;s of the Word is &s;tamped on every piece of the work, and providence of God. Now for further clea|ring I would offer the&s;e few things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The accompli&s;hment of the Scripture is a very publick te&s;timony from Heaven to its divinity, whil&s;t the Lord by his works through the earth, which are done in the view of Angels &amp; men, doth &s;olemnly avow that this is his Word. For we mu&s;t &s;ay, his work within on the hearts of his People, &amp; without about the Church, is &s;uch, whereat men, yea all the magi|cians of the earth, may &s;tand amazed, and confe&s;s that
<PB N="24" REF="005185_0059_1016D98FEC5215A8">
nothing le&s;s than a divine almighty power can ac|compli&s;h the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="2">2. This gives in the witne&s;s of all the generation of the righteous: who from the beginning have proved the truth thereof, yea, 'tis &s;ealed by the blood of many excellent Chri&s;tians, &s;ome of whom though they could not well di&s;pute for it, yet had &s;o &s;trong a demon|&s;tration of the power of the truth within, as made it an ea&s;y work to die for the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="3">3. This doth clearly &s;hew, the Scripture is an un|changeable rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s that alters not; but takes place in all ages, whence &s;uch as are wi&s;e to bring providence in to the Word, and compare the experience and remarks of one time with another, may have a great reach, &amp; be thus led in a &s;ure path, as to the fore&s;eeing of events.</P>
<P N="4">4. This al&s;o doth demon&s;trate, that it is his Word, who doth rule and guide the World, and hath a &s;ove|reign dominion over the &s;ame: whil&s;t we may here &s;ee &s;uch remarkable events, which both in the pre&s;ent and in former times have fallen out, as may &s;hew a power, that can reach the greate&s;t with a &s;troke, &s;hake the mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed Kingdoms, and even over the belly of in&s;uperable difficulties, accompli&s;h the Word; yea, that &s;urely the Spirit of the wheels which moves them, is from him who&s;e Word this is. For it is not more clear, that the&s;e curtains of the Heavens are &s;tretcht forth over the earth, than that the Scrip|ture is &s;tretcht out over the whole work and frame of providence: &s;o as that all the motions and &s;teps thereof, even of the mo&s;t ca&s;ual things that fall out, have a vi&s;i|ble tendency to accompli&s;h tho&s;e ends which the Scripture hath held forth.</P>
<P N="5">5. This clearly &s;heweth, it mu&s;t be his Word, who hath fore&s;een all things that were to befal the Church, and the various changes and adventures of every Chri|&s;tian's life through time: whil&s;t it is &s;o wonderfully
<PB N="25" REF="005185_0060_1016D9DE5D738148">
&s;haped and &s;uited to every new trial of the church, as if intended only for that time, and to every ca&s;e of a godly man, as though it had been alone writ for them.</P>
<P N="6">6. This al&s;o &s;heweth, that he who is the author of the Scripture, and hath framed that admirable piece, mu&s;t have &s;ome immediate corre&s;pondence with the Spirit of man, knoweth our &s;itting down, and ri&s;ing up, yea, doth &s;earch the heart and the reins. For experience can tell how the Word is directed to the heart, doth reach the mo&s;t inward contrivances there|of, doth &s;o clearly reveal and open up a Chri&s;tian to him&s;elf, that we may &s;ay, of a truth he is the God of the Spirits of all fle&s;h, and one greater than our heart, who&s;e it is.</P>
<P N="7">7. I &s;hall further add, the fulfilling of the Scrip|ture in the experience of the Saints doth &s;hew, it is nor a dead letter, but hath power, and life; and there mu&s;t be an enlightning quickning Spirit, that &s;urely goeth along with the &s;ame. This clearly demon|&s;trates &s;omething above words, yea, above nature, in the written Word, that can make &s;uch a change upon the &s;oul, give life to the dead, open the eyes of the blind, yea, can turn a lump of earth, that former|ly tended downward, now without any violence to move, from a principle of life towards God, as the &s;parks flee upward.</P>
<P>VI. <HI>The accompli&s;hment of the Scripture is a mo&s;t plea&s;ant, and truly delectable &s;ubject,</HI> worthy of our &s;erious thoughts, and &s;tudy. For here is held out the highe&s;t truth, for the judgment to contemplate the truth and faithfulne&s;s of God in the Word; and here is al&s;o the greate&s;t good for the affections to embrace, and delight in, as that wherein our whole happine&s;s is certainly wrapt up. It is undeniable, that it is the godly man, who knoweth be&s;t what true and &s;olid
<PB N="26" REF="005185_0061_1016D992FB87B730">
plea&s;ure is; which he doth not lo&s;e, by turning his heart from the creature to God, but maketh a ble&s;&s;ed exchange. O, how far do the joys and delights of the &s;oul exceed the&s;e of the &s;en&s;es! And the delight of a Chri&s;tian, how far doth it &s;urpa&s;s that of a natural man, even in his be&s;t e&s;tate! and &s;ure, this precious &s;tudy of the daily performance of the Word, is one of the&s;e paths of plea&s;ure, which would bring in more &s;olid joy to the &s;pirit in &s;ome few hours, than &s;ome years wallowing in the carnal delights of the fle&s;h, which is but as plea&s;ure in &s;port, but quickly turn|eth to grief in earne&s;t. It is one of the great mi&s;takes of the World, that religion tends &s;o much to &s;adden and di&s;quiet the Soul; nay, it is certainly the want of this, becau&s;e we are &s;o little truly religious. When we &s;huffle over our duty, and take but a pa&s;&s;ing look of the ways and work of God in the World, then it is indeed very affrighting, and unplea&s;ant; but when in a more Chri&s;tian way, we do &s;eriou&s;ly look thereupon, and get our heart near God, taking the Word along with us, O how delightful, and ravi&s;hing a &s;ight will this be! I truly think, though there were not a command, though it were no duty, nor &s;uch advantage in the &s;tudy of this grave truth, yet that joy and refre&s;hment, which the &s;oul would find in &s;uch a diligent &s;earch, in going down into this ble&s;|&s;ed deep, &s;hould invite us thereto.</P>
<P>But when I &s;peak of this, what a &s;weet, and de|lightful &s;ubject, the performance and outmaking of the Scripture is, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood, that it is &s;o only to the &s;aints: and it is no wonder; the World keep at &s;uch a di&s;tance from it; for this is a truth they can not bear, they hate it, which (as <HI>Micajah</HI>) doth pro|phe&s;y alway hard things, and carrieth a me&s;&s;age of death to them; a &s;erious View of this truth, to un|godly men, is as the handwriting upon the wall before them, which doth foretel their approaching ruin, and
<PB N="27" REF="005185_0062_1016D9E139B36490">
&s;hould cau&s;e them all to tremble; the knowledge whereof mu&s;t encrea&s;e their &s;orrow, and di&s;quietne&s;s, yea, cau&s;e them to cry out, O, do not torment us before the time. For they are &s;urely undone, and ruined, if the Scripture of God be true, and hath a performance. But, O what plea&s;ant and refre&s;hful tid|ings, doth this carry to a Chri&s;tian! What a &s;weet view doth he here get of the inheritance, and ble&s;&s;ed e&s;tate of the &s;aints, which may cau&s;e &s;uch an excla|mation, How great is that goodne&s;s, which is laid up for tho&s;e that fear thee!</P>
<P>To demon&s;trate this, I &s;hall hold out &s;ome things, from which we may &s;ee how delightful a &s;ubject the accompli&s;hment of the Scripture is, for a Chri&s;tian to &s;tudy.</P>
<P N="1">1. Serious conver&s;e with this grave truth leadeth forward to practice, and thus helpeth to bring down theory to experience: which is the mo&s;t &s;weet, and de&s;irable of all other demon&s;trations, that we can have of the truth of the Scripture, and maketh our light clear, and plea&s;ant to the eyes, turning the exerci&s;e of our judgment and rea&s;on thereabout, into &s;en&s;e and feeling; we are then made to &s;ee what a difference there is, betwixt that di&s;covery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;piritual man (who&s;e religion is his practice) hath of this, and the cold winter-light of natural under&s;tanding, that hath no heat or warmth therewith; which is as great a difference, as betwixt hearing of &s;uch a thing by re|port, and &s;eeing it with our eyes.</P>
<P N="2">2. This ble&s;&s;ed &s;tudy, how the Scripture hath cer|tain accompli&s;hment, would help us to read the Word with an other kind of plea&s;ure. O, what repre&s;en|tation &s;hould then the truths and promi&s;es thereof have to the godly man? It would be as one going in to look over his charters, and the great things therein contained, which he doth not in the lea&s;t debate, or que&s;|tion, &s;ince they are pa&s;t the &s;eals, and fully ratified,
<PB N="28" REF="005185_0063_1016D99492331690">
and now con&s;idereth all which is promi&s;ed, as his own, which he lookt in former times upon, but as a com|mon thing, whil&s;t he made not earne&s;t of the certainty thereof, and what an intere&s;t he had in the &s;ame. O, when he readeth that promi&s;e of a new heaven and earth, &amp; that glorious e&s;tate which abideth the Saints; He cannot turn his eyes &amp; thoughts &s;o ea&s;ily off it, but is made to &s;tand, and wonder, that &s;o great a thing, that will make &s;uch a marvellous change in his con|dition, is even &s;hortly to come to pa&s;s! How &s;weet and plea&s;ant is it, for &s;uch an one to turn over the promi&s;es, who can &s;et to his &s;eal, and bear this witne&s;s, that he hath as really prov'd the truth thereof by &s;ure ex|perience, as he knoweth he hath a real being! Surely the Bible is an other thing to the&s;e, than it is to the greater part of men, who only make it the &s;ubject of their contemplation.</P>
<P N="3">3. In this ble&s;&s;ed &s;tudy we &s;hould have much bro't to our hand to ob&s;erve, and our ob&s;ervation made &s;weet, and plea&s;ant to us. For there we might &s;ee how all the paths of the Lord towards his People are mercy and truth: this would give us a refre&s;hing diary of providence; how in &s;uch a plunging &s;trait we found the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;en&s;ibly &s;ealed; what ob&s;ervable confirmations we have had therewith, at &s;uch a time and in &s;uch a condition; the after-recounting of which in an hour of trial, or in the evening of our life, would exceed the greate&s;t plea&s;ures, the men of this World can have, in looking over their gold and greate&s;t trea&s;ures, which for many years they have been laying up.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the &s;erious &s;tudy of the daily accompli&s;hing of the Scripture, we &s;hould have a mo&s;t &s;atisfying view and pro&s;pect of what God is doing up and down the earth; what purpo&s;es and de&s;igns he hath on foot; and how things here beneath do work toge|ther for carrying on of the &s;ame. We &s;hould &s;ee what
<PB N="29" REF="005185_0064_1016D9E2DABC3D00">
in excellent and curious piece of work this frame of providence is, which the more it is con&s;idered, it will be the more a wonder; how perfect in all its various colours; what an ob&s;ervable concurrence there is here; how &s;everal di&s;cords, which we &s;ee here, do yet agree with one con&s;ent, for the com|pleating of God's de&s;ign, which is &s;till going on: and whil&s;t we think there mu&s;t be &s;ome di&s;order a|mong&s;t the wheels, we are made after to &s;ee that this confu&s;ion was an excellent &s;tep of providence, confounding the wi&s;dom of men; every piece of his way being &s;o knit to another, as di&s;covers to &s;uch who make this ble&s;&s;ed truth their &s;erious &s;tudy, a mo&s;t rare contexture, beyond the reach of the greate&s;t arti&s;ts that ever was.

upon its feet, and overclouded that it may &s;hine more brightly after: How the threatnings of the Word do vi&s;ibly overtake Kingdoms and Nations, bring down great hou&s;es, cau&s;e tho&s;e brought up in &s;carlet to em|brace the dung-hill, and oft let not the hoary head of <HI>cruel</HI> and wicked men go into the grave in peace: and again to con&s;ider how the Lord for&s;aketh not his People, but &s;heweth re&s;pect to their way; the good man walketh in his integrity, and his &s;eed after him is ble&s;&s;ed. O, how &s;weet an exerci&s;e were this for a Chri&s;tian, even to lo&s;e him&s;elf in!</P>
<P N="5">5. From thence we might in a great mea&s;ure di&s;|cern <HI>what of the night</HI> it is with the Church: if there be any evidences that it is near day; and what &s;uch a &s;inful ca&s;e doth threaten; we &s;hould be &s;kilful to feel the Churches pul&s;e, and thereby find what &s;ymptoms there are of life or death and perceive a dark cloud of judgment advancing, when it is but like an hand|breadth. Surely this &s;tudy would make us wi&s;e to know the times, and what we ought to do therein; for among&s;t tho&s;e various events which fall out in every age, the Lord's way is con&s;tant with it&s;elf, and with his truth, if we be right Ob&s;ervers.</P>
<P N="6">6. Here we &s;hould have a mo&s;t plea&s;ant and clear view, how the Scripture of God comprehendeth the whole &s;tate of the Church, from the beginning to the end of time: that it is a mo&s;t full, and perfect re|gi&s;ter of all the vici&s;&s;itudes and alterations, which are to go over her head, whil&s;t in a militant condition; and doth al&s;o mo&s;t exactly point out tho&s;e occurren|ces, and remarkable events, which fall out in the or|dinary way and cour&s;e of providence, that we may read them as evidently in the Word, as we &s;ee them with our eyes fall out in the World. For in follow|ing this &s;tudy, we &s;hould clearly &s;ee how the Scripture bringeth the Church to light, out of the womb of an eternal decree, and doth trace it from the fir&s;t promul|gation
<PB N="31" REF="005185_0066_1016D9E8F7FA9CB8">
of the Go&s;pel after the fall, through the&s;e dark times before the flood, whil&s;t it was but in families, and through that long trial in Egypt, and all its &s;et|led and flouri&s;hing condition in <HI>Canaan,</HI> and carrieth her for-ward through all the &s;everal changes of her ca&s;e, under her following decay, and in the time of the captivity, even to the manife&s;tation of Chri&s;t, and dawning of the go&s;pel: and as it thus taketh in within its reach the whole e&s;tate and the &s;pecial events, which did befal the Church under the Law, &s;o we may &s;ee how the Scripture al&s;o followeth the Church, through the whole time of the go&s;pel, and bringeth her as a grain of mu&s;tard-&s;eed from a day of &s;mall things, until it bring her to perfection, taketh her as it were by the hand from her infancy, and goeth with her through all the turnings of her condition; through that long and dark night of Antichri&s;t's reign, pointeth clearly out her condition, and various a&s;&s;aults that &s;he &s;hould endure in that time, and that ble&s;&s;ed victo|ry which &s;he &s;hould afterwards have, though not all at once, but gradually, over her enemies; and that the Word and the Church do never part, but one walketh &s;tep for &s;tep with the other, until it bring her &s;afe to land, and as it were put her off its hand and guard, at the coming of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. This would al&s;o help us to &s;weet thoughts, and give us matter of a &s;ong in the &s;adde&s;t night of the Church's condition. When we &s;ee how God's great de&s;ign in the World is the accompli&s;hing of the Scrip|ture, and know that his ends which he hath held forth therein, cannot be fru&s;trated, it would &s;erve to &s;ilence all our complaints, with wondering at God's way, and triumphing in the works of his hands: we &s;hould not then be afraid of evil tidings; a &s;tormy time would not outwit us; being per&s;waded that though the earth &s;hould be overturned, it &s;hall be &s;urely well with the righteous, the Church mu&s;t flouri&s;h,

and all her enemies be found liars, becau&s;e he is faith|ful that hath promi&s;ed, who&s;e Word will as &s;urely come to pa&s;s, as the &s;un doth return after a dark night.</P>
<P>VII. <HI>It doth now more &s;pecially concern the godly in the&s;e latter times, to &s;tudy this great truth of the accom|pli&s;hment of the Scripture,</HI> and &s;et about a &s;erious in|quiry and &s;earch therein, as a truth that &s;hall yet be in a further mea&s;ure di&s;covered, and opened up, the nearer the Church is to the end of time: which may thus appear.</P>
<P N="1">1. Herein is the Word expre&s;s, that one piece of the Scripture, which from former ages was &s;ealed up, &s;hould in the latter days be clear, and ea&s;y to under&s;tand. Dan. 12. 4&punc; 9. The &s;eal is there put on; <HI>but go thy way</HI> Daniel, <HI>for the&s;e Words are clo&s;ed up and &s;ealed till the time of the end.</HI> But, Rev. 22. 9. We have that bar taken of, <HI>Seal not the &s;ayings of the Prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand;</HI> becau&s;e then the time did draw near, to which a more full di&s;covery and opening of the Scrip|ture was re&s;erved, and a more large manife&s;tation of the &s;pirit beyond former ages. Now by the la&s;t days, we are not only to under&s;tand the whole time of the go&s;pel, though it is thus termed in the Scrip|ture, but the latter part of the&s;e la&s;t times, which is more e&s;pecially pointed at, even the clo&s;e and even|ing of time, that la&s;t <HI>Epocha,</HI> and period of prophe|tick chronology, to which a greater accompli&s;hment of Scripture-Prophecies is re&s;erved.</P>
<P N="2">2. This al&s;o is expre&s;ly promi&s;ed that in the latter days, the Church &s;hall have a more full di&s;covery of this truth, how the Scripture is verified, Dan. 12. 4. <HI>Many &s;hall run to fro, and knowledge &s;hall be increa&s;ed;</HI> which increa&s;e, as it clearly pointeth at the la&s;t times, and that bright day the Church &s;hall have, when I&s;rael &s;hall be brought in to
<PB N="33" REF="005185_0068_1016D9EC288F3590">
Chri&s;t, it doth al&s;o point at and promi&s;e &s;ome grea|ter light, and a more full opening up of the my&s;te|ries of the word, and fulfilling thereof: For the former part of the Chapter &s;heweth, that increa&s;e of know|ledge doth relate to tho&s;e things which were before &s;ealed. We wait and believe the further accompli&s;h|ment of this promi&s;e to the Church, beyond all we have yet &s;een; that many Scripture-truths, now dark and ab&s;tru&s;e, &s;hall be made &s;o clear, as &s;hall even cau&s;e us to wonder at the gro&s;s mi&s;takes we once had there|of, yea, that after-generations &s;hall have a di&s;covery and in&s;ight into &s;ome Prophecies now ob&s;cure, which &s;hall as far exceed us, as this time doth go beyond former ages, which comparatively we mu&s;t &s;ay were very dark. O! when that promi&s;e of the in-calling of the Jews &s;hall once take place, what a won|der will they be to them&s;elves, that their under&s;tand|ing &s;hould have been under &s;uch a vail, when the truth &s;hall be clear, and evident to them in that day! Will it not be a &s;weet and ea&s;y work, for the godly to &s;ort together the predictions of the Word, and the events? And truly there is much now wrapt up in Scripture-Prophecies, not yet fulfilled, which (we may &s;ay) in aftertimes, when the event &s;hall unvail their meaning, will exceed, yea, confound all tho&s;e comments, many have had upon them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is it not al&s;o clear, that tho&s;e Prophecies, which of all the Scripture were mo&s;t ob&s;cure, and overcloud|ed with dark figures and allegories, concerning which there had been &s;uch mi&s;take and he&s;itation by the Church, &s;o many perplexing queries, have a peculiar re&s;pect to the la&s;t times? And that then they &s;hall be made plain, and ea&s;y, when &s;o notable a key, as the event doth open them up; &s;uch as tho&s;e of the wit|ne&s;&s;es recovering life, and ri&s;ing again, Babylon's fall and ruin, Chri&s;t reigning with his Saints a thou&s;and Years, which now are in &s;ome mea&s;ure already cleared,
<PB N="34" REF="005185_0069_1016D99F2F6A5610">
from their begun accompli&s;hment, beyond former times; but we wait for a more full commentary, that time &s;hall give upon the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is in the latter times, that the glory of God in his truth and faithfulne&s;s, &s;hall mo&s;t eminently &s;hine forth. That is a part of the &s;olemn congratulation of the Church upon Babylon's fall, <HI>Rev.</HI> 15. 3. not only <HI>Great and marvellous are thy works,</HI> but, <HI>ju&s;t and true are thy ways.</HI> For truly in this &s;troke of the judg|ment of God, and tho&s;e remarkable providences con|curring therewith, the fulfilling of the Scripture will be &s;o plain and undeniable, that we may &s;ay, it will then dazel the eyes of men, even greate&s;t Athei&s;ts, alarm the World, yea very effectually contribute (we have ground &s;o to judge) to that promi&s;ed encrea&s;e of the Church, and incoming of the Jews, when in Antichri&s;t's fall and ruin they &s;hall &s;ee &s;o convincing a &s;eal put to one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Prophecies of the Word; in the accompli&s;hment whereof much of the Prophetick part of the New-Te&s;tament, relat|ing to the Church's &s;tate, and her long trial under Antichri&s;t's reign, may be &s;een clearly verified.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Lord hath re&s;erved his greate&s;t Works to the latter days, wherein his judgments &s;hall be mani|fe&s;t, and the Word confirmed by &s;uch &s;olemn con|vincing providences, that men will not get them pa&s;&s;ed without a remark: we are this day witne&s;&s;es to many &s;uch, and are looking what the&s;e times &s;hall yet bring forth, that the great and remarkable acts of the Lord mu&s;t force the World to &s;ee a divine power; and &s;ay, lo, there is an undoubted accompli&s;hment of the Scripture.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Church in the&s;e la&s;t Times hath peculiar advantages, for under&s;tanding this truth of the Scrip|ture's accompli&s;hment, which former ages had not. 1. A great part thereof is now fulfilled, that men may &s;ee with their eyes, if they but know how to lay the
<PB N="35" REF="005185_0070_1016D9EDE6A2EA38">
Word and Work of God together. The Chri&s;tian Church had in former times but dark glances at the&s;e great things, which we have this day vi&s;ibly tran&s;|cribed in providence; the promi&s;es were then tra|velling in birth of that which is now brought forth. 2. Are we not mounted, as it were, on the &s;houl|ders of that experience and ob&s;ervation of former times, which hath been tran&s;mitted to us? and we mu&s;t &s;ay upon that account, the Church hath now a greater &s;eal and confirmation of the truth, then what it had in the days of the Prophets, and the Apo&s;tles, even when Chri&s;t was in the fle&s;h. 3. The Temple of God and Ark of his Te&s;tament is now opened in Heaven, light more fully abounding, and the means of knowledge. And, O! &s;hould not this be much our &s;tudy, who have a greater talent than former ages! cer|tainly this will be a &s;in of a deeper dye, than in times of ignorance; &s;ince we can be no &s;trangers to this truth, without &s;hutting our eyes, blinding the con|&s;cience, doing violence to our light, when the Lord doth give his People &s;uch &s;olemn confirmations.</P>
<P N="7">7. I &s;hall add, is it not clearly foretold in that <HI>Dan.</HI> 12. 4. that in the la&s;t times this will be one of the &s;pecial exerci&s;es of the &s;aints to enquire, and make a diligent &s;earch concerning the Scriptures accom|pli&s;hment? For it's there &s;aid, <HI>many &s;hall run to and fro, and knowledge &s;hall be increa&s;ed;</HI> importing, that this &s;hall be much their &s;tudy, and cau&s;e a dili|gent &s;earch, whereunto the great works of God in the&s;e times &s;hall invite them: And what &s;hould be the po&s;ture of the Godly in the&s;e days, on whom the end of the world is come? &s;hould it not be like the watchman in the la&s;t-watch of the night, who looketh oft what appearance there is from the ea&s;t of the day breaking? a &s;erious enquiry what of the Scripture is fulfilled, whereby we may know on very clear grounds,
<PB N="36" REF="005185_0071_1016D9A25B327E70">
if the night be far &s;pent, the day at hand, &amp; that the coming of the Lord to judgment draweth near.</P>
<P>VIII. <HI>This is a great, and concerning duty for Chri&s;tians to &s;tudy this truth, that they may have &s;omething more than Report, how the Scripture hath a &s;ure accompli&s;h|ment,</HI> and doth take place in the providences of the time wherein we live. I mu&s;t think it &s;trange, that there is &s;uch a great help as this, &s;o near, and yet we &s;ee it not, nor do &s;eriou&s;ly ponder the &s;ame, when the command is &s;o expre&s;s to ob&s;erve the works of the Lord, which for that end are &s;hewed forth, that men may enquire, and read the faithfulne&s;s of God therein; yea, that &s;o great a truth, which would abide the &s;earch of all the criticks of the World, a truth wherein our ble&s;&s;edne&s;s through time and eternity li|eth, &s;hould offer it &s;elf to our trial, and yet, is &s;o little known! O, who can di&s;pen&s;e with the neglect of this duty? by which we an&s;wer that &s;olemn call and invitation of the works of God, do honour him, &s;erve our generation, are helpers to our own faith, and are thereby helped to &s;trengthen others, yea, are brought to &s;ee with our eyes, and from experience, what before was as a &s;trange thing unto us.</P>
<P>Now to clear how much this is a Chri&s;tian's duty, to &s;tudy a practical conver&s;e with the Word, and to be &s;erious ob&s;ervers of its accompli&s;hment, let us con&s;ider.</P>
<P N="1">1. We are thus helped to declare the Works of the Lord, and to give him the glory of his faithfulne&s;s. And is not that a weighty duty? Which at all times, in every &s;tation and condition of life, &s;hould engage men to this &s;tudy. Thus, every Chri&s;tian may become a witne&s;s to the truth, and put his &s;eal thereto; for which he &s;hould think his life truly de&s;ireable, and doth in no &s;mall mea&s;ure attain the true end thereof, though he had no other opportunity, for his ma&s;ter's
<PB N="37" REF="005185_0072_1016D9EF80382ED0">
&s;ervice. We may &s;ay, this truth of the Scripture's ac|compli&s;hment, like a great roll, hath been tran&s;mit|ted from hand to hand, from one age to another, atte&s;ted and as it were &s;ub&s;cribed by &s;o many witne&s;|&s;es, it doth thus come to our time, and to every man's door and require their per&s;onal witne&s;&s;ing and &s;ealing of the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="2">2. This &s;hould make it an ea&s;y work, to tru&s;t the Word, and to adventure thereon in the ordinary oc|currences of their life. They may well tru&s;t God in a &s;trait, who have &s;o &s;trong an argument to make u&s;e of, that oft they have tried him, and the truth of his Word, by many, many experiences. Will not <HI>tho&s;e that know his name, tru&s;t on him?</HI> Which was a notable te&s;timony from a &s;erious Chri&s;tian in a very &s;harp trial; "Oft have I tried God, and &s;hall I not learn to tru&s;t him once?</P>
<P N="3">3. This doth lay the Chri&s;tian in the way of that promi&s;e. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 107. <HI>la&s;t. ver.</HI> a promi&s;e truly large and comprehen&s;ive, but little con&s;idered, that <HI>&s;uch as are wi&s;e to ob&s;erve the works of God, they &s;hall &s;ee the loving kindne&s;s of the Lord,</HI> even in their own particu|lar ca&s;e made out to them, yea, whil&s;t they are &s;erious to ob&s;erve his works abroad in the World, and his way to others, they &s;hall be no lo&s;ers thereby at home; but find this promi&s;e meet them and turn their general ob&s;ervation, into per&s;onal experience of the loving kindne&s;s of the Lord.</P>
<P N="4">4. Thus the &s;aints by experiencing the truth of the Word, get a convincing &s;eal thereby to their intere&s;t in the promi&s;e. For begun po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is indeed a &s;trong witne&s;s to this right, when they can &s;ay, they have got as certain returns of the Word, which they have put to an e&s;&s;ay, in &s;ome particulars of their life, as they are &s;ure of any thing they did ever &s;ee; &s;o that from unque&s;tionable experience they may &s;et up a pillar, and write thereon, <HI>Hitherto hath the Lord helpt us.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="30" REF="005185_0073_1016D9A43AE8B428">
5. Thus &s;hould Chri&s;tians, with much advantage, be helped to convince gain&s;ayers. For it's &s;ure, A|thei&s;m could not make &s;o bold and publick an ap|pearance, if men did not &s;o much take their religion on tru&s;t. O, the &s;erious experienced man can with an other confidence own the truth; who&s;e experi|ence and ob&s;ervation of the works of God give him an argument that none can an&s;wer, while not only he can a&s;&s;ert, but conduct and lead men to the things them&s;elves, that they may &s;ee, if in &s;uch and &s;uch particulars the Scripture be not truly fulfilled.</P>
<P N="6">6. Thus the providence of God would have a more &s;weet refre&s;hing countenance: when from this great height, that watchtower of Chri&s;tian ob&s;ervation, we take a view thereof. And truly, otherways, men will &s;tumble at the mo&s;t ordinary di&s;pen&s;ations, and think God's Work is a ma&s;s of confu&s;ion: but here we are taught to &s;ee, how the written Word and his way are linked in a mo&s;t &s;weet agreement.</P>
<P N="7">7. We may thus trace Divine truth, even by our &s;en&s;e and feeling, and joyn the Word and experience in a regular corre&s;pondence: yea, thus we &s;hould have a clear tran&s;cript of the Lord's way with his Church, taken out of that great authentick original of the Scripture, and there &s;ee on what a &s;olid ba&s;is and foundation, that magnificent &s;tructure of providence is rai&s;ed up. What a notable key &s;hould we thus have for opening the Scripture, by a &s;erious hum|ble inquiry after the works of God? Where not only the impre&s;&s;ion and &s;ign of the power, but of the truth and faithfulne&s;s of the Lord, are &s;o very le|gible.</P>
<P N="8">8. This is a piece of our talent, wherewith we are entru&s;ted; of which every Chri&s;tian &s;hould &s;tudy a &s;erious improvement, knowing they mu&s;t render an account, what their ob&s;ervation of this great truth
<PB N="39" REF="005185_0074_1016D9F3D1209CF0">
hath gained, and what further e&s;tabli&s;hment and con|firmation they have thus attained.</P>
<P N="9">9. I would add, the concernment and weight of this &s;tudy may pre&s;s it much on us. For, if the Scrip|ture's accompli&s;hment be an undoubted truth, O! then this is &s;ure, the Saints have a great inheritance: they are Princes, though now under a di&s;gui&s;e; and though yet minors, they are heirs of more than the World can &s;hadow forth. The Chri&s;tian is then more happy on a dunghil, &s;craping his &s;ores, than &s;uch who are cloathed in purple, and fare delicately every day. If this be &s;ure, we &s;hould look with compa&s;&s;ion, rather then envy, on tho&s;e whom the World doth account happy: We need not que&s;tion the gain of Godline&s;s; then it is &s;ure, that &s;uch who &s;ow in tears, &s;hall reap in joy; and the righteous though now trampled upon, in the morning &s;hall have dominion. Yea, in a word, we may then on &s;ure ground &s;olace our &s;elves with the thoughts of that great change, which will be within a little time when the grave mu&s;t render back her pri&s;oners; and may with as much a&s;&s;urance of a ble&s;&s;ed re&s;urrection, lie down in the du&s;t, as we are &s;ure there will be a morning, when we lie down at night. O! then, there is a Heaven, and a Hell, that is certain; eternity is not a night-dream; and one moment &s;hall &s;hortly put an end to all our &s;ervices, yea, the &s;hutting of our eye|lids at death, &s;hall but open them in the Paradi&s;e of God.</P>
<P>Having touched this truth a little in the general, I &s;hall now hold forth &s;ome arguments, whence <HI>the ac|compli&s;hment of the Scripture</HI> may be demon&s;trated: they are the&s;e five, which I intend to pro&s;ecute in the following di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="005185_0075_1016D9A5EB118EF8">
<HI>FIRST Argument,</HI> To prove the Scripture is certainly fulfilled, and hath an accompli&s;hment, is this; That which hath been in all ages the te&s;timo|ny of the Saints; what every particular Chri&s;tian doth &s;eal, from their frequent and &s;ure experience; what is found and proved by them, in their daily walk, upon exacte&s;t trial; yea, what as many as ever were &s;erious in religion, do witne&s;s, mu&s;t be certain and true.</P>
<P>But the accompli&s;hment of the Scripture is &s;uch: Therefore, <HI>&amp;c,</HI></P>
<P><HI>II. Argument.</HI> That which is manife&s;t and le|gible in the whole cour&s;e and tenor of providence a|bout the Church, and by clear convincing in&s;tances both of judgment and mercy is made out to the ob&s;ervation of every age, mu&s;t be a certtin truth. But the Scripture's <HI>accompli&s;hment</HI> is &s;uch,&mdash;Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>III. Argument.</HI> That which hath not only the Chri&s;tian's te&s;timony from experience, and of the Church from con&s;tant ob&s;ervation, but is obvious even to the view of the World; that which, from the con&s;cience of the wor&s;t of men doth force a te&s;timony, that they can neither &s;hift nor deny; which al&s;o may be demon&s;trated to the conviction of ordinary ob|&s;ervers, and hath a publick acknowledgement from greate&s;t Athei&s;ts and mockers of religion in every age, mu&s;t &s;urely be a clear truth.</P>
<P>But, &amp;c. Therefore&mdash;.</P>
<P><HI>IV. Argument.</HI> That which was to take place in &s;uch and &s;uch periods of time, and hath accordingly come to pa&s;s, the event exactly an&s;wering to the pre|diction; yea, that whereof a great part is now ful|filled, and but a little at this day remaineth to be made out, mu&s;t be a certain truth.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="005185_0076_1016D9F87881DDB8">
But a great part of the Scripture is thus already fulfilled, and but a little thereof now remaineth.</P>
<P>Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>V.

<HEAD>The FIRST ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THat the Scripture of God, contained in the old and new Te&s;taments, wherein our great hope and comfort doth lie, is certainly true, and hath a real accompli&s;hment, may be thus demon&s;trated: <HI>That it is tried, and proved in the godly man's Experience, to which in all ages, yea, from innumerable Proofs, the &s;aints have put to their &s;eal, that this is a &s;ure and faithful te&s;|timony.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Experience</HI> is indeed a &s;trong demon&s;tration: and it is &s;uch a witne&s;s, as leaveth no room for debate. For here the truth is felt, proved, and acted on the heart; which the Chri&s;tian knoweth well, and is as &s;ure of, as he is per&s;waded that he liveth, or that the &s;un when it &s;hineth, hath light and warmth therewith. It is true, the World liveth at a great di&s;tance from this; they only conver&s;e with the &s;ound of &s;uch a thing: and we know, the naked theory of Scripture-truth hath but a &s;hort reach, and that it differeth as far from that which a &s;erious practical Chri&s;tian hath, as the &s;ight of a country in a map is from a real di&s;covery of the
<PB N="42" REF="005185_0077_1016D9AE9366B0A8">
&s;ame; where the difference is not in the degree, but in the kind. Yet, tho' this weighty te&s;timony of ex|perience is a thing whereto many (ala&s;s! too many) are &s;trangers, we mu&s;t &s;ay, &s;o much thereof is obvious, as may force its authority on men's con&s;ciences, and &s;hew there can be no fallacy or delu&s;ion in this wit|ne&s;s, if they but allow the u&s;e and exerci&s;e of rea&s;on: &s;eeing it is not the record of a few, at one time, or in one corner of the earth, but a &s;olemn witne&s;s from the &s;aints and followers of God, who&s;e judgment and integrity their adver&s;aries mu&s;t often confe&s;s; yea, of all the &s;aints in every age through the whole univer&s;al Church in parts of the earth mo&s;t remote from other; and this by mo&s;t frequent renewed proofs hath found and experienced the truth and real accompli&s;hment of the Word. And now, if this be not &s;ufficiently convincing, I would but add, O <HI>will you then come and &s;ee!</HI> be but Chri&s;tians indeed, and then ye will no more debate that te&s;timony. And truly it is a very poor &s;hift, for men, who have the Scripture before them, which of it&s;elf doth witne&s;s its authority, and this backed with &s;o &s;olemn a &s;eal from the Lord by his works and providence, to debate the Chri&s;tians witne&s;s, from their experience, becau&s;e they do not &s;ee this them&s;elves: For what is the cau&s;e thereof? is it not their choice, that they do not <HI>follow on to know</HI> the &s;ame? The truth of God &s;eeketh credit from no man upon tru&s;t; yea, craveth no more but that by a prac|tical conver&s;e they would put it to a trial: and then it &s;hall not decline their judgement.</P>
<P>Now to pro&s;ecute this argument a little, I &s;hall point at &s;ome &s;pecial <HI>Scripture-truths,</HI> with which Chri&s;tians have mo&s;t u&s;ual trade and conver&s;e in their own ca&s;e; and give in therewith their te&s;timony how the&s;e are clearly proved and verified by mo&s;t &s;ure <HI>experience.</HI> It is not to be here under&s;tood,

the giving a particular account, with re&s;pect to per|&s;ons, time, or other circum&s;tances, how the Word doth thus take place. I think, it may be &s;ufficiently convincing, to in&s;tance in the general &s;uch clear un|controverted experiences, which are well known to the godly, and have by them been oft proved amid&s;t the various changes of their life (though not by all in the &s;ame mea&s;ure, but in &s;ome &s;uitable proportion to their different &s;izes, trials, and wre&s;tlings) which can witne&s;s that real corre&s;pondence, which the Word hath with the experience of the &s;aints: and truly con|cerning the&s;e I may with &s;ome confidence a&s;&s;ert, they are not naked or airy notions, but &s;uch as can witne&s;s their truth to the &s;erious experienced Chri&s;tian, whom on this account I dare atte&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here in&s;tance in five &s;pecial truths of the Word, which are much tried and proved in Chri&s;tians experience. 1. That there is &s;uch a contrariety be|twixt the fle&s;h and the &s;pirit, as the Scripture holdeth forth. 2. The deceitfulne&s;s of man's heart. 3. That there is a &s;piritual and invi&s;ible adver&s;ary, with whom we have war. 4. That the promi&s;es of the Word have undoubted accompli&s;hment. 5. That truth al&s;o of the threatnings; I mean, &s;uch under who&s;e reach the godly may fall.</P>
<P>I. <HI>That there is a contrariety betwixt the fle&s;h and the &s;pirit,</HI> a Law in our members rebelling again&s;t the Law of our mind, is a truth very clearly proved to the Chri&s;tian; who&s;e experience, though &s;ad, doth un|deniably verify and confirm the Scripture, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 17. <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 19, 21, 23. This is a piece of the Word which holds forth man's nature in its true &s;hape and form, whither their bya&s;s and inclination mo&s;t ea&s;ily turneth: yea, &s;o marvellou&s;ly an&s;wereth their ex|perience, that to que&s;tion the &s;ame, were to put it far beyond que&s;tion, that they know nothing of a new na|ture
<PB N="44" REF="005185_0079_1016D9B085F7DCD0">
or principle of grace within. For whatever made earne&s;t of Religion, but their fir&s;t acquaintance with the peace of God was the beginning of this war? It is then that the hou&s;e divideth, and corruption &s;etteth up a &s;tandard; yea, no &s;ooner can any begin to be a Chri&s;tian, but he mu&s;t be a &s;ouldier al&s;o. And we may &s;ay, none ever attained &s;uch a mea&s;ure of mortifi|cation, or was &s;o old in the grace of God, as could priviledge them from the &s;tirrings of the old man, and nece&s;&s;ity of that complaint, <HI>Who &s;hall deliver us from the body of death!</HI> But what ever advantage &s;ome of the &s;aints have above others, yet in this their expe|rience can witne&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">1. They now know two different parties within them&s;elves, that until once grace came they could not under&s;tand; which at the &s;ame time, in the very &s;ame action, do act oppo&s;itly one to the other: yea, that there is no &s;piritual duty, wherein the fle&s;h (though not always in &s;uch a prevalent degree) doth not &s;hew &s;ome active re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P N="2">2. That all the &s;tirrings and motions of the fle&s;h have &s;till a tendency, congruous to their own nature, to turn the heart carnal, and to alienate it from God; &s;o as it is ea&s;y to di&s;cern, how in the&s;e the ri&s;e and the end do throughly corre&s;pond.</P>
<P N="3">3. That this is a cruel ta&s;kma&s;ter, if once it bear &s;way; imperious in its command, and violent in its pur&s;uit: &s;o that their experience may herein tell, it's a &s;ore and an intolerable thing, for a <HI>&s;ervant to bear rule.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That to things mo&s;t forbidden the fle&s;h moveth mo&s;t impetuou&s;ly; &s;o, as it will even break through the hedge, though &s;ure thereby to be &s;cratcht with thorns: yea, it is oft &s;o eager in its pur&s;uit, that it will follow the bait, while the hook is mo&s;t di&s;cer|nable.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="45" REF="005185_0080_1016D9FD36C08E48">
5. That when once this doth &s;well, and wax fat; they may upon another intere&s;t cry, <HI>Woe's us, our leanne&s;s!</HI> For, like the &s;cales of the ballance, they find a proportionable abatement and depre&s;&s;ing of their &s;piritual life, as the fle&s;h goeth up; yea, they have cau&s;e to know how every &s;tep of their heart going forth to the World, is a &s;tep that doth put them fur|ther off from God.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the more clo&s;ely the Law is pre&s;t in its &s;piritual extent, yea, the more &s;piritual a duty is, the more fully oppo&s;ite they find their carnal heart: and though the fle&s;h may bear up a little with the form of Religion, and hath more complacency with that way which lieth mo&s;t in externals, yet it cannot endure the power thereof; it can &s;uffer men to be Hypocrites, but not truly Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="7">7. To re&s;train and bring this under bondage, they find that it doth put the &s;pirit &s;o much at liberty, which getting loo&s;e reins for a little while will leave the &s;oul work for many days, and with &s;ad after-groans pay back an hour's plea&s;ure: yea, they al&s;o know, when the outward man is low, and under a &s;en&s;ible decay, it hath not then hindered, but rather effectually helped their inward joy and &s;trength.</P>
<P N="8">8. That indulgence to the fle&s;h cau&s;eth a &s;en&s;ible thick interpo&s;ition between Heaven and the &s;oul; whence they are &s;o clogged and hampered in their flight and motion toward God; yea, thus have of|ten their choice&s;t duties been made a &s;ore and grievous ta&s;k.</P>
<P N="9">9. That this is the true ri&s;e of their u&s;ual pertur|bations, and doth &s;till put &s;ome jar betwixt them and their lot and doth hinder a &s;atisfied enjoying of that which they have, through murmuring at that they want; yea, they know, that to plea&s;e the fle&s;h hath been oft the cau&s;e of their greate&s;t grief and di&s;|plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="46" REF="005185_0081_1016D9B21B6E9928">
10. They al&s;o find how the defilement of their &s;pirit doth help to darken it: which overgrown with the fle&s;h, can have no clear di&s;covery of &s;piritual things; but the more &s;eparate from the body, and purged from the&s;e gro&s;s dregs, they find them&s;elves at a further advantage to conver&s;e with divine truths, which thus they get di&s;covered, beyond all that nature can reach.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>That the heart of man is deceitful, and de&s;perately evil</HI> (Jer. 17. 9. Jer. 4. 14. Prov. 4. 23.) <HI>Is a Scripture truth, where to the Chri&s;tians experience</HI> doth an&s;wer, as the face an&s;wereth to its &s;elf in the gla&s;s: yea, we may &s;ay, it is &s;o clearly demon&s;trated to tho&s;e who were ever &s;erious about their inward ca&s;e, that while they thus read the Word in them&s;elves, and are made to read them&s;elves in the Word, they may with wonder acknowledge, that he which can &s;ound this great deep of the heart, and draw &s;o vive a portraicture thereof, is &s;urely one before whom all things are ma|nife&s;t; who doth &s;earch and try the reigns, and know what is our mould and fa&s;hion. This is one of the very fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons, which practical Religion doth teach: and the more nearne&s;s with God, and further mea&s;ure of grace, that is attain'd, the more clear di&s;covery there will be of this. O what &s;ad hours, what bitter complaints, hath it cau&s;ed? This oft doth marr the Chri&s;tian's fea&s;t, and mingle their Wine with Gall and wormwood. I am &s;ure, if that excellent company of the Saints, who have been from the beginning to this day, could be brought together, to give in their &s;uffrage, and witne&s;s concerning the deceitfulne&s;s of the heart, there would be one joynt te&s;timony to this truth. We &s;hould find that <HI>Enoch</HI> who walk'd with God, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> with whom he &s;pake face to face, that beloved Di&s;ciple who leaned on Chri&s;t's bo&s;om, and

he who was caught up to the third Heavens, were no &s;trangers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, but could witne&s;s thus.</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is within which aileth them mo&s;t, and their greate&s;t adver&s;aries are men of their own hou&s;e: yea, that in the wor&s;t of times, there is &s;till more cau&s;e to complain of an evil heatt, then of an evil and corrupt World; there being no wor&s;e company, than they are oft to them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">2. That no time of their life, but might give them &s;ome further proof, that they are fools, who tru&s;t their own heart, which oft will e&s;cape and over-reach their quicke&s;t reflexion, even when both their eyes are on it; yea, that there is no time that alloweth the putting off their armour, or to di&s;mi&s;s their guard; not the be&s;t ca&s;e, the greate&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment in grace, nor the evening of the day, though they were within &s;ome minutes of the crown and compleat victory, doth priviledge them from the experience of a deceitful heart.</P>
<P N="3">3. That under the be&s;t frame, they find, there will often lurk that which after-time doth di&s;cover, that for the pre&s;ent (though it had been told) they could not have believed, until frequent experience maketh them &s;ee, that the Word knew their heart better than them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4">4. That to bring home their heart, when once it goeth abroad, or recall the liberty they have given it, is not ea&s;y; which doth no &s;ooner parley with a temp|tation at a di&s;tance or adventure to &s;port therewith, but it quickly turneth to earne&s;t and is ready to yield.</P>
<P N="5">5. They know the con&s;tant need to have a watch upon their &s;en&s;es, and to make a Covenant with their eyes, which do quickly betray their heart; &s;o ea&s;y it is to be deceived, yea, to grow warm, and to take fire upon the &s;malle&s;t touch.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="48" REF="005185_0083_1016D9B4C9F8C3D0">
6. How quickly al&s;o their &s;pirit doth &s;lacken, and lo&s;e its bent, even in the greate&s;t advantage of their ca&s;e; their experience can tell, that when in &s;ome mea|&s;ure they have been rai&s;ed up in any &s;piritual enjoy|ment, they were then in hazard to be lift up to the wind, and to have their &s;ub&s;tance di&s;&s;olved in the more &s;olid part of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P N="7">7. What a &s;ight have they &s;ometime of them&s;elves? &s;uch as would be a terrour to them, if the heart and motions thereof could be writ out to the view of others, or that any were witne&s;&s;es to that which in one room will dwell be&s;ides the grace of God as its next door-neighbour.</P>
<P N="8">8. In a word their experience doth witne&s;s, how &s;oon the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;olutions will evani&s;h; that they are not oft in the evening, what they were in the morn|ing, nor for many hours do they keep the ground they had attained: but <HI>Reuben's</HI> Character, <HI>un&s;table as water,</HI> may be &s;till their complaint. Yea, I am &s;ure as many as ever obtain'd mercy to know them&s;elves, can tell that it's pa&s;t all reckoning, how oft their heart hath deceived them, when they tru&s;ted it mo&s;t. This every day may cau&s;e them to &s;it down, and admire the grace of God; which can mend what they &s;o oft marr; and is &s;tronger to &s;ave and pre&s;erve, than they are to de&s;troy.</P>

<P N="1">1. That there is &s;urely another party than the World, or them&s;elves, with which they have to do; an <HI>invi&s;ible adver&s;ary without,</HI> whom they perceive by that &s;en&s;ible corre&s;pondence he keepeth with their heart within, by tho&s;e violent inroads, importunate &s;olicitations, tho&s;e impetuous motions, wherewith they are &s;o &s;trangely hurried, and oft driven over light, and judgment, yea, over their &s;tronge&s;t re|&s;olutions, &s;o as he may be as di&s;cernable to them, and that there is &s;omething therein be&s;ide them&s;elves, as if they conver&s;ed with him in an outward vi&s;ible &s;hape.</P>

<P N="4">4. That his ordinary approaches to the heart are oft by a very <HI>&s;mall</HI> thing: he needs no more but an open door, or a &s;inful look for the di&s;patch of a temp|tation, and knoweth by a wound in the eye, how to carry death in unto the &s;oul.</P>

Yea, to a&s;k at &s;uch, if they know whe|ther there be a truth in Scripture-promi&s;es, that co|meth not to pa&s;s, I think were to enquire at a living man, whither he &s;eeth and feeleth, or if there he &s;uch a thing as motion, &s;ince they have as &s;ure and &s;en&s;ible a demon&s;tration of the one, as he hath of the other.</P>
<P>But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ere I &s;peak any thing particularly to this, I would fir&s;t premi&s;e &s;ome things, to clear what we un|der&s;tand

here, by the &s;aints <HI>experience</HI> of the <HI>truth</HI> of the promi&s;es, in the&s;e following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. We would con&s;ider, though the Scripture hath here it's accompli&s;hment, and is intended for the u&s;e of the Church, and every particular Chri&s;tian, while on the way in his militant condition, yet there are <HI>&s;ome promi&s;es</HI> of the Word (yea, the greate&s;t) which belong to the &s;aints, that will <HI>not</HI> be fulfilled, until they have <HI>ca&s;t off their armour,</HI> and are called to divide the &s;poil: their experience of which, will be the <HI>high prize of the calling of God in Chri&s;t,</HI> whereof, all which they now enjoy, is but an earne&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. We would con&s;ider that the great <HI>intent</HI> of the Scripture, and promi&s;es thereof, is not for contem|plation, but that we may know them by <HI>experience,</HI> and drive a ble&s;&s;ed trade and commerce therewith; <HI>the merchandize of which is better nor that of gold:</HI> for here lieth the Chri&s;tian's life in the World, yea, it is a great part of their <HI>talent,</HI> the promi&s;es, which are not to be laid up in their heart and memory, as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a napkin,</HI> but they mu&s;t give an account what ex|perience they have <HI>gained</HI> thereby, and thus the dili|gent hand &s;hould make rich.</P>
<P N="3">3. What ever be the different &s;izes, and degrees of experience among the &s;aints, according to their growth and age in Chri&s;t, yet it is certain that the meane&s;t who have intere&s;t in the promi&s;es, and did ever embrace them in earne&s;t, and put them to trial, mu&s;t know &s;omething of the performance of the &s;ame in <HI>their own</HI> ca&s;e; for the Lord doth not &s;uffer his work in his People to want a &s;eal.</P>
<P N="4">4. The godly's experience hereof, is then much made out, when they are much in <HI>ob&s;ervation;</HI> and we know little of the truth and performance of the promi&s;es, becau&s;e we are not more habitually in a frame to ob&s;erve. Thus he <HI>goeth by,</HI> and <HI>we per|ceive not;</HI> but they never wanted confirmations,
<PB N="54" REF="005185_0089_1016D9BE72A63790">
who were &s;eriou&s;ly &s;eeking to be confirmed in the truth of the Word.</P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;pecial mercies and providences of a Chri&s;tian life, are a certain <HI>return</HI> of the promi&s;e, and in that way do meet them, as the proper channel of their conveyance; for they are the <HI>&s;ure mercies of the Covenant:</HI> and how refre&s;hful is it, that all the &s;e|veral ca&s;es of the Saints, their meane&s;t as well as their greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ities, and their outgate or relief are comprehended in the Word, and under &s;ome pro|mi&s;e, and were all fore&s;een in his everla&s;ting view, who hath &s;o marvellou&s;ly &s;uited the &s;ame to all that his People &s;tand in need of, as if it had been directed to &s;uch and &s;uch a Chri&s;tian only!</P>
<P N="6">6. This helpeth to make the mercies of the godly man to have a <HI>peculiar</HI> and <HI>&s;weet reli&s;h,</HI> and to be &s;ome way twice his mercy, when he gets them in &s;o im|mediate a way reached to him as it were out of the promi&s;e, and as an ob&s;ervable return from Heaven; when thus the Lord <HI>&s;ealeth</HI> his Word to him by his work, and the way of the Word he findeth hath been the way of his comfortable Relief; that when he hath had no other e&s;cape, but to turn in to the pro|mi&s;e, and to ca&s;t him&s;elf upon it, he gained this ex|perience, <HI>he tru&s;ted in God, and was helped;</HI> and can give in this te&s;timony of him, that <HI>he hath both &s;poken it,</HI> and <HI>him&s;elf al&s;o hath done it,</HI> according to his Word.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is <HI>not</HI> any <HI>extraordinary</HI> thing, we here un|der&s;tand, by the Chri&s;tian man's experience of the truth of the promi&s;es; it is not a <HI>rapture</HI> or <HI>revelation,</HI> or &s;uch as &s;ome of the Saints have upon &s;ome <HI>&s;ingular</HI> and <HI>&s;pecial</HI> account had; for we have not any <HI>promi&s;e</HI> for the&s;e things: But it is &s;omething well groun|ded upon the <HI>Word,</HI> which con&s;tantly holdeth in the Lord's <HI>ordinary-way</HI> of procedure with his People, ac|cording to the tenor of the Covenant. For <HI>his Word,
<PB N="55" REF="005185_0090_1016DA0E649A1E00">
doth good to them that walk uprightly;</HI> and doth certainly take place in the experience of every &s;erious and diligent Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="8">8. This is not the te&s;timony of a few, but the re|cord of <HI>all</HI> the Saints &s;ince the beginning, who&s;e ex|perience doth all mo&s;t harmoniou&s;ly agree, and bear <HI>one witne&s;s,</HI> that <HI>he is faithful who hath promi&s;ed;</HI> &amp; it is not that which a Chri&s;tian hath found once or twice in his life, but the <HI>daily</HI> food of &s;uch as live by faith.</P>
<P N="9">9. This doth put a &s;trong obligation on the godly man to the Word, <HI>for the time to come;</HI> for the&s;e who have tryed it often, may with much confidence tru&s;t it in the day of their &s;trait.</P>
<P N="10">10. The experience which the godly hath of the real performance of the promi&s;es, is a mo&s;t convinicng <HI>evidence of his &s;tate in Chri&s;t.</HI> It is the earne&s;t and pledge of the inheritance, and full accompli&s;hment of that which remaineth; that <HI>the Lord will perfect what concerneth him,</HI> who <HI>hath been his help hitherto;</HI> and will be <HI>his exceeding great reward</HI> in the end, who hath made him find &s;o much of the <HI>gain of godline&s;s</HI> here by the way.</P>
<P>Now having premi&s;ed the&s;e things, I &s;hall here in&s;tance &s;ome <HI>particular promi&s;es,</HI> wherein the Chri&s;tian's mo&s;t u&s;ual trade and commerce doth lie, and to which they give in their &s;eal and witne&s;s. I confe&s;s, if all the&s;e proofs which the Saints have had, of the fulfilling of the promi&s;es, could be gathered to|gether, we might make u&s;e of that Divine hyper|bole, <HI>The World could not contain the books that &s;hould be written thereof.</HI> O what an admirable volume, what an excellent commentary, and copy &s;hould this be of the Scripture, to &s;ee it thus turned over into the experience of every Chri&s;tian! It would be &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ea&s;y to number the drops of rain and dew &s;ince the creation, as to reckon all the&s;e precious
<PB N="56" REF="005185_0091_1016D9C0380A4C58">
drops and emanations of love, the&s;e &s;en&s;ible returns and accompli&s;hments of the promi&s;e, which they have had in their experience. I truely think, it could hardly be believed, though it were told, what &s;ome of the god|ly here have found in the way of the Word: but it is &s;ufficient, to an&s;wer the de&s;ign of this work, to &s;hew that there is a &s;en&s;ible demon&s;tration and per|formance of Scripture-promi&s;es, concerning which the experience of the Saints in all ages doth agree; that by many confirmations the Lord hath oft &s;ealed the truth thereof to their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>There are 10 <HI>&s;pecial promi&s;es,</HI> held forth to the godly in the Word, which I &s;hall here in&s;tance, and therewith hold forth what a clear te&s;timony their experience can give, of the undoubted truth and accompli&s;hment of the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>FIRST In&s;tance, is that promi&s;e given to Belie|ving;</HI> to &s;uch who credit the <HI>naked word,</HI> when there is no probable appearance of its fulfilling, and thus give God the glory of his faithfulne&s;s; which we have expre&s;ly held out, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 20. 20. <HI>Ps.</HI> 112. 7. 8. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 50.</P>
<P>To clear the accompli&s;hment of this promi&s;e, I &s;hall but appeal to that te&s;timony the &s;aints in all ages have left thereof; yea, to the pre&s;ent experience of the godly at this day, if they have not certainly found it &s;o&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That when in a particular they have tru&s;ted God therewith, and got their &s;pirit quiet in a recumbency on him, he hath dealt with them according to his word; yea, if then from clear convincing returns of the promi&s;e, they have not been made to &s;ay, it did never re|pent them, that they gave more credit to the te&s;timony of God, than of their own hearts.</P>
<P N="2">2. That they have not found a more &s;weet and ob&s;ervable i&s;&s;ue, than when their help lay mo&s;t im|mediately
<PB N="57" REF="005185_0092_1016DA0FF2B27078">
on the word alone; never a more comfortable Relief than when lea&s;t of &s;en&s;e and mo&s;t of faith was in carrying them through, when little of the creature and much of God appeared in their mercy, and when they were at the lowe&s;t, having no way of e&s;|cape but to throw them&s;elves on the promi&s;e, they have then had the be&s;t retreat, yea, their &s;upply as &s;en&s;ibly felt, as their need and burden had former|ly been.</P>
<P N="3">3. That their greate&s;t difficulties and &s;hakings a|bout the promi&s;e, have helped to their further confirm|ing and e&s;tabli&s;hment: &s;o as they can &s;ay, the Lord's way, by perplexing them fir&s;t, yea, to their &s;en&s;e lo&s;ing their Hold, hath helped to fa&s;ten it better; and that which for the time did &s;peak their ca&s;e mo&s;t helple&s;s, hath made way for his more eminent ap|pearance and manife&s;ting of him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="4">4. That their greate&s;t venture, and giving mo&s;t out, hath u&s;ually had the riche&s;t income: the mo&s;t e|minent experiences of their life have followed the mo&s;t adventurous acts of their faith; yea, upon an after-reckoning they have oft found, that their adventuring of life, e&s;tate, and credit on the promi&s;e of God, even in the&s;e things, hath very ob&s;ervably been their Advantage.</P>
<P N="5">5. That where they have mo&s;t been a friend to their faith, there hath faith al&s;o been mo&s;t a friend to them: in their &s;tanding to the credit of the promi&s;e, nor di&s;|mayed by the greate&s;t objections and fal&s;e reports rai&s;ed thereof, they have found a very evident mark of God's re&s;pect to the &s;ame, cau&s;ing them to &s;ee, that he will honour &s;uch who thus honour him. And it is indeed worthy of a remark, what we have of <HI>Caleb</HI> upon record, that he took part with the promi&s;e of God a|gain&s;t that di&s;couraging report which then was rai&s;ed of the <HI>Anakims,</HI> and their walled cities; and there|fore the inheritance of the Children of <HI>Anak</HI> was
<PB N="58" REF="005185_0093_1016D9C524B66C18">
given to <HI>Caleb</HI> and his &s;ons, in their lot from the Lord.</P>
<P N="6">6. That believing doth always make way for &s;en&s;e, and in their clo&s;ing with the naked Word of promi&s;es, they have not wanted the &s;eal of the Spirit of promi&s;e; but have found a &s;weet-calm, their burden &s;en&s;ibly ca&s;ed, when once they got it &s;aid over on the word, which they can &s;ay hath been their fir&s;t re&s;ting place, like the very fixing of the motion of the needle to|wards its right point, when their &s;pirit had been re&s;t|le&s;s and in greate&s;t agitation.</P>
<P N="7">7. That the greate&s;t di&s;appointments, which their hope in the Word &s;eemed to have, they have found afterwards mo&s;t to their advantage; when their returns have not only been according to their faith, but have often exceeded their adventure, and been far beyond what they believed: yea that from fre|quent experience they may &s;ay, the i&s;&s;ue of tru&s;ting the Word, how long &s;o ever they thought it de&s;erted, yet came always in &s;ea&s;on, was never too late and out of time.</P>
<P N="8">8. That this did never occa&s;ion bitter reflexions, or was their reproach before the World, that they tru&s;ted God in a day of &s;trait and were not helped: but this te&s;timony have all &s;uch left, who have mo&s;t credited it in a di&s;mal hour, that none &s;hould fear after them to hazard upon &s;uch a hand and venture on the pro|mi&s;e; for their faith hath oft carry'd them well and comfortably through, where both &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on have been ready to &s;ink.</P>
<P><HI>SECOND In&s;tance,</HI> Whereby we may &s;ee the performance of the promi&s;e in Chri&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> experience, is this, <HI>That God truly heareth prayer;</HI> is near unto his People in what they call upon him for, agreeable to his Word, and will an&s;wer their de&s;ires; we have this
<PB N="59" REF="005185_0094_1016DA1345EC0D60">
promi&s;e mo&s;t expre&s;s. <HI>Phil.</HI> 4. 6. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 32. 6. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 65. 2. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 91. 15.</P>
<P>Now the accompli&s;hing of this part of Scripture is &s;o very clear, that I can atte&s;t the experience of all <HI>the generation of the righteous,</HI> &s;ince the beginning, what frequent and unan&s;werable confirmations they have got of this truth in their Chri&s;tian walk: &s;o that I am &s;ure, no man ever was in earne&s;t in the matter of Religion, and a &s;tranger to this; yea, that he was never more certainly per&s;waded of any thing, than of this, that God doth hear prayer. O if men's &s;ouls were but <HI>in their &s;ouls &s;tead,</HI> who&s;e evening-wre&s;|tlings and tears the Lord hath oft turned into a morning-&s;ong, they would know this is no delu&s;ion. I &s;hall here touch &s;omething of that experience, which by many proofs the &s;aints can give, as a witne&s;s to this promi&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. That when they have oft with <HI>Hannah</HI> gone in before the Lord in the bitterne&s;s of their &s;pirit, they have been made to return with a &s;en&s;ible and mar|vellous change in their ca&s;e; yea, when in going a|bout prayer, they have been put to wre&s;tle with much di&s;temper and deadne&s;s, they have oft &s;een the wind di&s;cernibly change, and therewith their &s;pirits light|ned from under that burden, an ob&s;ervable calm and &s;erenity following much inward perturbation; yea, they can &s;ay, that they have found their hearts thawed, and put in a flu&s;h of tenderne&s;s, upon the back of a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible re&s;traint.</P>
<P N="2">2. That acce&s;s and liberty to pour forth their &s;ouls to God, when he hath filled their mouth with ar|guments, and inabled them both to wre&s;tle and wait, they have found a favourable <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> and begun Relief, yea, the very turn of a &s;ad ca&s;e, which they have got from the Lord, as the pledge of a further an&s;wer, and that when he thus <HI>prepareth the heart,</HI> he doth <HI>cau&s;e his ear to hear.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="60" REF="005185_0095_1016D9C6B4E8C108">
3. That when they have been under a mo&s;t dark cloud, they have found their &s;ky clear, have got a very &s;en&s;ible ta&s;te of God's acceptation in prayer, and of his taking their &s;ute off their hand, even while the matter was &s;till in dependance before him; yea, that they have oft had &s;uch a &s;atisfying impre&s;&s;ion of God's mind, and per&s;wa&s;ion of his an&s;wering their de&s;ire, as hath helped them cheerfully to wait, yea, &s;ometimes to &s;ing the triumph before the victory.</P>
<P N="4">4. That when they had been much in prayer, they mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ay, it hath been the time wherein their &s;pirit hath flouri&s;hed, was mo&s;t lively; yea, then they had their be&s;t days; then <HI>the candle of the Lord &s;hined upon their pathes,</HI> and <HI>his dew lay all night upon their branches.</HI> But they have found there is an evident and proportionable abatement of their &s;piritual life and encouragement in God, according to their wearing out in the exerci&s;e of this duty.</P>
<P N="5">5. They have many times found, that when there was nothing left them, but to turn in to God, and they knew of no other way to come through, but to pray and look up, they never found a more &s;weet and &s;ea&s;onable relief: &s;o that mo&s;t ob&s;ervable times of prayer have been al&s;o the mo&s;t ob&s;ervable times of their experience; and they can &s;ay from many proofs, it is no hopele&s;s bu&s;ine&s;s, which is put over upon God by prayer, though there be &s;mall outward appear|ance.</P>
<P N="6">6. That it is not in vain to follow out a &s;ute before the throne, but acce&s;s and intere&s;t in Heaven is as &s;ure a way to come &s;peed (which they know well) as greate&s;t intere&s;t upon earth; having &s;o evidently found, while <HI>many &s;eek the ruler's favour,</HI> that the determination of every thing is <HI>from the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. That prayer, with quiet waiting in the u&s;e of means, getteth comfortably through, where over|caring

and carnal policy, in the u&s;e of all other &s;hifts, hath been forced to &s;tick.</P>
<P N="8">8. They know by experience, that as there are judi|cial times, wherein an inhibition as it were is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on them from the Lord, in their wre&s;tling, yea, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd a &s;ore re&s;traint on their &s;pirits, which hath been very &s;en&s;ible, &s;o al&s;o they have found times of more ea&s;y acce&s;s, and abundant liberty, a &s;pirit of prayer let forth, before &s;ome &s;pecial mercy and deliverance to the Church, whereby they could in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;cern its near approach.</P>
<P N="9">9. That on the back of &s;ome &s;olemn addre&s;s and application to God by prayer and fa&s;ting in a day of &s;trait, they have oft &s;een cau&s;e even from that day and upward to date a remarkable return, and deliver|ance, in which even common ob&s;ervers might di&s;|cern what an evident an&s;wer the Church's interce&s;|&s;ion with God in times of extremity hath had.</P>
<P N="10">10. I may add, the &s;aints know this &s;o well by experience that &s;urely God heareth prayer, even in &s;uch and &s;uch a particular, that they can with much confidence adventure, and make an errand of the meane&s;t, as well as their greate&s;t concernments to him; having &s;o oft tried, and found that &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s and &s;incerity in addre&s;s to God was never in vain, but what ever be the times, therein this promi&s;e taketh place, <HI>your heart &s;hall live, that &s;eek God.</HI></P>

<P>The accompli&s;hment of which is &s;o manife&s;t, &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible demon&s;tration thereof in the experience of the &s;aints, that I am &s;ure this can no more be deny|ed, than tho&s;e who are warmed with the heat of the &s;un, can deny their &s;en&s;e and feeling, that the &s;un

Now to demon&s;trate this a little, I would but touch &s;ome of the ordinary experi|ences of the &s;aints therein, which they do te&s;tify and by clear undeniable evidences know to be no de|lu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. That which cau&s;eth &s;o <HI>real a change</HI> upon them, which maketh them <HI>alive to God,</HI> who once were dead, creating them as it were of new, that which bringeth a clod of earth &s;o near Heaven, rai&s;eth &s;o far above them&s;elves to a delightful conver&s;e with things not &s;een, that while their place and abode is here, their company and fellow&s;hip is above; that which maketh all things new to them and doth &s;o far change their nature and inclination, as cau&s;eth them to find more &s;weetne&s;s in a &s;piritual life, than in the plea|&s;ures of &s;in, yea, reconcileth them with the Law, and exerci&s;es of a Chri&s;tian, where once there was &s;uch contrariety: Oh! is not this a real effect of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and no imaginary thing!</P>

<P N="3">3.

<P><HI>FOURTH In&s;tance, is that Promi&s;e for Direction,</HI> which God hath given his People in the Word; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e will <HI>guide them with his Coun&s;el,</HI> will <HI>order</HI> and <HI>direct their &s;teps,</HI> who do commit their way, to him, and <HI>teach them the way that they &s;hall choo&s;e, P&s;al.</HI> 37. 5. <HI>P&s;.</HI> 25. 9. 14. <HI>P&s;.</HI> 74. 24.</P>
<P>The fulfilling of which hath been &s;o manife&s;t to tho&s;e who ever made earne&s;t of acknowledging God in their ways, and committing the conduct thereof to him, that I &s;hall but atte&s;t their experience, if they have not this te&s;timony to give&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That to tru&s;t God with their ca&s;e, and give him the guiding of their way, hath carried them much more <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> through a plunging ca&s;e, than overcaring anx|iety; yea, the Lord's directing their &s;teps, and ma|king things &s;ucce&s;sful, when they have committed the &s;ame to him, hath been often as <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> to them, as their &s;trait and difficulty was.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the way of the <HI>word</HI> hath been the be&s;t expedient for carrying them &s;afe and comfortably through; and that they never repented, that they did more con&s;ult their <HI>duty,</HI> than inclination, when they were at a &s;tand about a particular, and did not debate the command, even while there &s;eemed <HI>a lion in the way.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That they were <HI>never left without</HI> coun&s;el and direction, when <HI>their eye was &s;ingle,</HI> and <HI>&s;erious</HI> a|bout it; and that it was not &s;o much want of light, as of an heart to clo&s;e therewith, that made their way oft &s;o dark: but when they &s;ubjected them&s;elves to God's

mind, they found, that &s;uch who follow him, &s;hall not walk in darkne&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. That light and coun&s;el doth meet men in fol|lowing the command, and the <HI>practice</HI> of known du|ty, hath helped them to <HI>know more</HI> their duty; and that light did mo&s;t abound, when it was mo&s;t their &s;erious &s;tudy to follow the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="5">5.

<P N="6">6.

<P N="7">7.

<P N="8">8. I &s;hall add, they have oft ob&s;ervably found, how ea&s;y their way was made to them when the Lord doth <HI>countenance</HI> and pro&s;per the &s;ame: what &s;weet concurrence of providences; how then difficul|ties have mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly been taken out of the way, yea, wind, and tide going along with them, in &s;uch a

<P><HI>FIFTH In&s;tance, is the promi&s;e of Pardon,</HI> and <HI>forgivene&s;s</HI> which God hath given his People in the Word: that for his names &s;ake he will <HI>blot out their iniquity,</HI> and <HI>remember their &s;in no more;</HI> yea, is <HI>ready to pardon;</HI> which is expre&s;ly held forth, to tho&s;e who are truly humbled. <HI>Mic.</HI> 7. 18. <HI>Jer.</HI> 31. 34 <HI>I&s;.</HI> 43. 25.</P>
<P>Now that there is a real accompli&s;hment of this, I am &s;ure, the experience of the &s;aints can in all ages clearly witne&s;s; what joy and peace this hath occa&s;i|oned, what a &s;en&s;ible demon&s;tration and &s;olemn confirmations they have had of this promi&s;e, &s;o as their very bones might &s;ing; <HI>Who is like unto thee, O Lord!</HI> It is true real pardon doth not always in|fer the <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> feeling thereof; and when Sin is re|mitted in Heaven, there is not always a declaration of it in the <HI>con&s;cience.</HI> But it is al&s;o &s;ure, that this is &s;en&s;ibly felt, and that it is tryed by all, even <HI>all the ge|neration of the righteous,</HI> to have had as powerful an operation on a di&s;quieted troubled &s;oul, as ever wine or the choice&s;t cordial could have on the &s;ick, or faint. O! if tho&s;e who que&s;tion this, were in their ca&s;e, to whom <HI>God &s;peaketh peace</HI> after a &s;torm, they would know how real and certain that is! I would offer the Chri&s;tians witne&s;s to this promi&s;e, from many, many experiments, by which the Lord hath &s;ealed it to their &s;oul, whereby they know a&s;&s;uredly it is no fancy or delu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1.

until once they made an addre&s;s, and got their &s;oul vented by confe&s;&s;ing to the Lord, which was then like a kindly turn and cool of a fever.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. It is no delu&s;ion, which they <HI>can not command;</HI> no more, than the &s;un to &s;hine when overclouded, or the wind to blow, but when it li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">teth: which the mo&s;t per&s;wading moral arguments can no ways ef|fectuate, nor all their former experience, nay, nor the let|ter of mo&s;t refre&s;hing promi&s;es, which &s;ometimes are to them but as the white of an egg, without ta&s;te, until once the &s;pirit breathe; which not only di&s;covereth the ground of their joy in the word, but doth al&s;o cau&s;e them to rejoyce therein, when it &s;hi|neth upon the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="4">4. It mu&s;t be no delu&s;ion, which cau&s;eth &s;o marvel|lous a <HI>change,</HI> that after greate&s;t di&s;quieting <HI>fears</HI> they have found mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible <HI>manife&s;tations</HI> of love; the greate&s;t flood on the back of the lowe&s;t ebb in their &s;piritual condition; which oft hath forced them to retract, what their fears and jealou&s;ies did utter; yea, hath made them enquire with wonder, whence they are &s;o chearful to day, who ye&s;ternight were &s;o broken and cru&s;ht? whence their &s;pirit &s;hould be in &s;o &s;weet a calm, that &s;o lately was like the raging and troubled &s;ea?</P>
<P N="5">5. That this hath oft met them, as a ble&s;t <HI>&s;urpri|zal</HI> and unexpected welcome, when they have in a <HI>back&s;liding</HI> ca&s;e come in to God, they certainly

know: that when they knew not how to adventure, and at what end of their raveled condition to begin, counts having run long over; yet on their very fir&s;t addre&s;s, have got a &s;weet di&s;appointment to their fears, been helped to their feet, yea, &s;ome times have had as it were the <HI>fatted calf</HI> killed, to make merry with their friends.</P>
<P N="6">6.

<P N="7">7.

<P><HI>SEVENTH In&s;tance, is that promi&s;e of the word which integrity, in an evil time hath;</HI> that it &s;hall <HI>pre&s;erve their &s;teps,</HI> and be the be&s;t means to help tho&s;e through, that keep God's way, yea, even in this life &s;hall not want &s;ome witne&s;s of God's re&s;pect. <HI>P&s;.</HI> 18. 25. <HI>P&s;.</HI> 112. 4. <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 10.</P>
<P>Now to hold forth the accompli&s;hment of this, I may with confidence appeal to the ob&s;ervation of the &s;aints in all ages, who ever made it their &s;erious &s;tudy to <HI>keep their garments</HI> clean in a time of try|al, if their experience hath not this te&s;timony to give.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that though at pre&s;ent, <HI>hone&s;ty</HI> in evil times hath brought them in hazard, and with <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> to a pri&s;on, yet it hath brought them out al&s;o, with ob&s;ervable <HI>advantage;</HI> yea, how ever the Lord did order their Deliverance, they have found this did land them well, and always bring them to a comfortable harbour.</P>
<P N="2">2. That hone&s;ty and faithfulne&s;s hath an <HI>autho|rity</HI> even on the con&s;cience of their <HI>enemies,</HI> and
<PB N="74" REF="005185_0109_1016DA2869518F78">
leaveth u&s;ually a conviction upon them: Yea, hath forced a te&s;timony and approbation from &s;uch men, and they have oft found better entertainment, than tho&s;e who in a &s;inful way have &s;ought to plea&s;e them.</P>
<P N="3">3. They have found this integrity always the <HI>choic|e&s;t expedient</HI> and be&s;t policy <HI>in</HI> a dangerous time, which hath ob&s;ervably met them, when they had mo&s;t to do; A thing whereof they have reaped the fruits <HI>in</HI> the day of their &s;trait, and times of judgment; yea, though it hath <HI>occa&s;ioned</HI> &s;ometime their &s;ufferings, yet it hath been al&s;o their &s;afety and protection from &s;adder &s;ufferings.</P>
<P N="4">4. That though integrity is oft under a dark cloud of reproach, yet it &s;till getteth well out from under the &s;ame, and hath &s;hined u&s;ually <HI>more bright</HI> after|ward: So as they have had cau&s;e to ob&s;erve, what unexpected means the Lord hath made u&s;e of, for their clearing.</P>
<P N="5">5. That while their <HI>enemies</HI> might have (were it not for the preventing goodne&s;s of God) quarrelled upon &s;ome <HI>other</HI> ground, they have been ob&s;ervably led to pur&s;ue, and make them the Butt of their ma|lice, for their hone&s;ty, and that wherein they have peace before God, and have been kept from hitting on the <HI>right</HI> cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. They find how un&s;peakably <HI>&s;weet</HI> this is upon an <HI>after-reckoning,</HI> and in the <HI>evening of their life,</HI> that then they reap a comfortable harve&s;t, of that they have &s;own with much &s;uffering and tears. O! then it doth not repent them, that <HI>integrity</HI> was their choice.</P>
<P N="7">7. They have &s;ometime found a <HI>hundred-fold</HI> even in <HI>this life;</HI> and an ob&s;ervable gain in that, which they have been willing to ri&s;k and hazard mo&s;t.</P>
<P N="8">8. They mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ay, integrity was <HI>never their ruin;</HI> but an e&s;cape was oft brought about in a way
<PB N="75" REF="005185_0110_1016DA7387940870">
they could not have expected; yea, the Lord's &s;hut|ting all other doors upon them hath been, that he might open one him&s;elf, like <HI>Hagar's</HI> well &s;pringing up in the wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P N="9">9. That in making their aim, when they had a large heart for God, they have not then wanted an <HI>opportunity</HI> for <HI>evidencing</HI> the &s;ame; their encour|agement hath abounded with their duty; and they have got much <HI>in,</HI> in giving much <HI>out</HI> for Chri&s;t; that there was no &s;uch <HI>fea&s;t</HI> in the world, as they have &s;en&s;ibly found in the te&s;timony of a <HI>good con|&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P><HI>EIGHTH In&s;tance is that promi&s;e,</HI> which is held forth to the Chri&s;tian in the word, <HI>of &s;trength and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to go about duties. I&s;.</HI> 40. 29. 30. 31. <HI>P&s;.</HI> 18. 6. 14. <HI>P&s;.</HI> 84. 5. <HI>P&s;</HI> 68. 28.</P>
<P>To clear this, that it hath an unque&s;tionable per|formance, I atte&s;t the experience of <HI>the generation of the righteous.</HI> Who ever knew what it was to <HI>&s;erve the Lord in the &s;pirit;</HI> and by many &s;en&s;ible confir|mations, have not prov'd the certainty of the&s;e things?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that when they have gone about duty under much <HI>deadne&s;s</HI> and &s;traitne&s;s of &s;pirit, they have found a very &s;en&s;ible <HI>enlargement,</HI> and got their bonds <HI>lea&s;ed:</HI> which &s;urely they could no more com|mand, without the concurrence of divine help, and &s;omething above nature, than the&s;e who &s;pread out the &s;ail, can command a fair wind, when it is cro&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. That God's help and concurrence was never more di&s;cernably carrying them through, and making them &s;trong, then in the day, that (to their own &s;en&s;e) they were mo&s;t <HI>weak,</HI> when they have gone about duty under greate&s;t fears, and fainting in &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="3">3. That when they had mo&s;t <HI>confidence in them|&s;elves,</HI> and judged they were at greate&s;t advantage in

their going about &s;ome duty, they have u&s;ually had the &s;adde&s;t retreat; and found that a &s;ure truth, <HI>the race is not to the &s;wift, nor the battel to the &s;trong.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. They know well what an influence divine con|currence hath, not only upon their inward frame, but al&s;o upon the exerci&s;e of their gifts, yea, upon the commone&s;t abilities of judgment, and memory; and that there is a mo&s;t remarkable difference, betwixt them&s;elves at one time, and another, according to the blowing of this wind.</P>
<P N="5">5. They mu&s;t al&s;o witne&s;s this as their experience, they found <HI>duty</HI> never more <HI>ea&s;y</HI> to them, than when they have had <HI>mo&s;t to do,</HI> and were kept mo&s;t throng|ed and pre&s;&s;ed therein; yea, when much work was laid to their hand, they then wanted not an <HI>enlarged</HI> allowance for the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="6">6.

<P N="7">7. They find God doth rai&s;e the &s;pirit of his follow|ers, with a &s;uitable elevation for their work, and can <HI>fit</HI> them for the &s;ervice of that time, and other tri|als thereof, even beyond their <HI>ordinary reach.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8.

<P N="10"><PB N="77" REF="005185_0112_1016DA75AB929638">
10. It hath oft been their experience, that in <HI>follow|ing</HI> the way of God, his candle did then <HI>&s;hine upon their paths,</HI> the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Lord was with them, and &s;en&s;ibly poured out: the <HI>withdrawing</HI> whereof hath been no le&s;s di&s;cernable, while they <HI>turned a&s;ide</HI> from him; that they have then been put to bear the burden alone, and found difficulty and de&s;pondency of &s;pirit at once growing upon their hand.</P>
<P N="11">11. I may add, what tho&s;e who are &s;erious in Re|ligion have oft tried, that there is no &s;uch <HI>help</HI> and <HI>furniture</HI> for going about duties, as a <HI>&s;piritual frame,</HI> and <HI>nearne&s;s</HI> with God: for then light, and coun&s;el, inward freedom, and &s;weet compo&s;ure of &s;pirit, have brought mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible advantage to them: in their greate&s;t, yea, and in their mo&s;t common undertakings, this hath been very evident.</P>
<P><HI>NINTH In&s;tance, is that great promi&s;e; we have,</HI> Rom. 8. 28. <HI>That all things &s;hall work together for good to them who love God.</HI> And P&s;al. 25. 10. <HI>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth, to &s;uch as keep his Covenant.</HI>&mdash;I confe&s;s, it is not ea&s;y &s;ome|times to reconcile God's way and this piece of his Word together: tho&s;e who take only an ordinary pa&s;|&s;ing view of providence, cannot well judge, how &s;uch things, wherewith oft the godly in their life are exerci&s;ed, &s;hould contribute to their good and ad|vantage; while nothing would &s;eem more directly cro&s;s to the &s;ame. But the Chri&s;tian and wi&s;e ob|&s;erver can give another account: they know what a &s;ure truth this is, that there is no real jarr betwixt the promi&s;e and providence of God in this matter; and what ever be the pre&s;ent thoughts, patient wait|ing hath had cau&s;e to &s;ay this,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. When <HI>his way</HI> and <HI>their thoughts</HI> have mo&s;t <HI>differed,</HI> in the accompli&s;hment of his Word and bringing about their mercy, they have found it was

to their <HI>advantage;</HI> that his choice was always better then theirs; yea, they have been oft made to confe&s;s, that their &s;adde&s;t di&s;appointments therein have tended to their further Benefit.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Lord's <HI>denying</HI> them &s;ome out|ward thing, which they have mo&s;t de&s;ired, they have found (as afterwards hath appeared) was to <HI>grant</HI> them more than their de&s;ire; he hath refu&s;ed them as it were in an <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> that he might give them an <HI>I&s;aac.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. They can oft &s;ay, they had been <HI>undone,</HI> if they had <HI>not</HI> been undone; that it was their mercy, the Lord took &s;uch a way to ca&s;t them in a <HI>fever,</HI> to pre|vent a <HI>lethargy;</HI> and by &s;ome &s;harp cro&s;s gave them a wound in the <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> to cure and let out &s;ome gro&s;s impo&s;tume in their <HI>&s;oul,</HI> which would have made their ca&s;e wor&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. How <HI>greate&s;t &s;hakings</HI> have helped their <HI>fur|ther e&s;tabli&s;hment;</HI> &s;o as they were never more con|firmed, than in that about which they have been mo&s;t perplexed. Yea, they have al&s;o found this the Lord's way, to cure their frowardne&s;s and mi&s;belief by &s;ome further <HI>addition</HI> to their cro&s;s: that when they would not believe, he hath cau&s;ed them to come in upon a greater di&s;advantage; while as a &s;mall affliction hath made them impatient, a more heavy and pre&s;&s;ing trouble hath been their cure, and helped them to keep &s;ilence under God's hand.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the <HI>growing</HI> of difficulties in their way, and &s;ome <HI>further</HI> pre&s;&s;ure in the trial, they have found was from the Lord in order to its <HI>removal,</HI> and to the bringing forth of &s;ome <HI>greater</HI> good: and that all vi&s;ible grounds of confidence have been oft broken, but with this advantage in the up&s;hot, that their mercy, they had it more <HI>immediately</HI> out of God's own hand; yea, that the le&s;s <HI>moderation</HI> there was whil&s;t their trial hath come to an extremity, they
<PB N="79" REF="005185_0114_1016DA79ED3CD750">
have found it then upon the turn, and their hope and encouragement oft made to &s;pring up therewith.</P>
<P N="6">6. How the Lord's <HI>deferring</HI> their mercy, which they had oft &s;ought, hath been <HI>indeed</HI> their mercy and advantage, which did always meet them in the &s;ea&s;on; yea, they mu&s;t &s;ay, his way is always neare&s;t, and waiting on God without making ha&s;te, doth truly make the quicke&s;t di&s;patch.</P>
<P N="7">7. Their experience can al&s;o witne&s;s, how <HI>men's re|proach,</HI> and venting their malice that way to ruin their reputation, hath oft been the occa&s;ion, ordered by the Lord, to bring forth their further <HI>clearing,</HI> and vin|dication even by that very mean.</P>
<P N="8">8. How by &s;ome &s;ad cro&s;s he doth oft <HI>prevent</HI> a <HI>&s;adder;</HI> which though &s;trange at fir&s;t, they have been forced upon after-di&s;covery to confe&s;s: The man, who riding in ha&s;te to the &s;ea-port, to have pa&s;&s;age over &s;eas with a &s;hip going then off, fell and broke his leg by the way, which was the &s;aving of his life; for the &s;hip, and all its pa&s;&s;engers, peri&s;hed in that voyage; yet this was a bitter a&s;toni&s;hing providence to him for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="9">9. How their <HI>lo&s;s,</HI> even by &s;ome &s;ad &s;lip and fail|ing, in their <HI>&s;piritual</HI> condition, hath really tended to their further humbling and advantage; yea, that which brought them under &s;ome vi&s;ible decay, as to the wonted lu&s;tre of their Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion hath helped them to grow more under ground, in the root and &s;ub&s;tantials of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P N="10">10. They can tell how tho&s;e <HI>&s;teps</HI> of the provi|dence of God, which &s;eemed mo&s;t <HI>cro&s;s</HI> to that de|&s;ign he was carrying on, yea, looked like the very cru&s;hing of their <HI>hope,</HI> have oft been the very mean which hath wrought mo&s;t <HI>effectually</HI> to bring about their mercy.</P>
<P N="11">11. I &s;hall add but this, as the Chri&s;tian's witne&s;s to the truth of this promi&s;e; That the &s;harpe&s;t <HI>reproo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="005185_0115_1016DA324A38D240">
have &s;eemed the <HI>wounds of a friend,</HI> and mo&s;t pre&s;|&s;ing <HI>&s;traits</HI> made the mean for their further <HI>enlarge|ment;</HI> how the Lord hath brought them into &s;ome dark and plunging trial, which then looked like a fearful pit, that he might bring them out with ad|vantage, <HI>&s;et their feet on a rock,</HI> and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h their goings;</HI> yea, that in the hotte&s;t furnace, they lo&s;t no|thing but what they might well &s;pare, even &s;ome of their dro&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>TENTH In&s;tance,</HI> is <HI>that general promi&s;e</HI> made to <HI>Godline&s;s,</HI> and tho&s;e who make it their &s;erious &s;tudy, that it &s;hall be great <HI>gain; that verily it &s;hall be will with the righteous, for they &s;hall eat the fruit of their labour, and in keeping of the command there is a great reward.</HI> 1 Tim. 6. 6. 1.

<P>This is indeed a great concerning truth; but a truth, which, I am &s;ure, none who did ever make ear|ne&s;t of religion, will call in que&s;tion. Many con|vincing experiments hath the Chri&s;tian had thereof through his Life: &s;uch want not &s;ome diary and record, wherein they can ca&s;t up the advantage, they have reaped in clo&s;e following of God and their duty; yea, from mo&s;t remarkable providences they may oft &s;ay, <HI>This I had, becau&s;e I kept thy precepts.</HI> Now, that this promi&s;e hath a large witne&s;s, I &s;hall here touch &s;ome things, which I may with &s;ome con|fidence &s;ay, both in the pre&s;ent and in former times have been proved, and &s;ealed by the &s;aints in their ex|perience.</P>
<P N="1">1. That they never more effectually con&s;ulted their <HI>good</HI> and advantage, than when they did with great|e&s;t &s;inglene&s;s con&s;ult their duty, and lea&s;t with <HI>fle&s;h and blood:</HI> they did never more truely <HI>&s;eek them&s;elves,</HI> than in the practice of &s;elf-denial; yea, in what they intended God mo&s;t, and lea&s;t their own private inte|re&s;t,
<PB N="81" REF="005185_0116_1016DA7E63998298">
they have therein found a very &s;en&s;ible advan|tage.</P>
<P N="2">2. That a &s;erious endeavour to <HI>walk before God</HI> acceptably, they have found &s;till the <HI>be&s;t policy,</HI> even in the <HI>wor&s;t of times;</HI> and have found his way then very &s;atisfying, while it was mo&s;t their &s;tudy how to plea&s;e him: yea, they have been obliged to confe&s;s, that when the Lord's way was their <HI>choice,</HI> they have found it al&s;o their <HI>reward.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. They have found more real joy &amp; peace in <HI>with|&s;tanding</HI> temptations, than in any thing the temptation <HI>offered;</HI> and in laying their intere&s;t <HI>at God's feet,</HI> and their will underneath <HI>his,</HI> more than in all their <HI>carnal</HI> enjoyments. O the ta&s;te, and te&s;timony of God's ap|probation! how &s;weet a &s;mile is his, in who&s;e coun|tenance Heaven lieth!</P>
<P N="4">4. That inward peace and tranquillity of mind, a &s;weet calm and compo&s;ure of &s;pirit, doth as really attend a <HI>&s;piritual frame</HI> and <HI>walk,</HI> as the &s;hadow the body; and their be&s;t and mo&s;t comfortable days, wherein they have truly walked at liberty, have been when their heart was mo&s;t <HI>&s;ubject to the Law,</HI> with a &s;ingle re&s;pect to the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="5">5. That Religion and a &s;piritual walk is the be&s;t friend, even as to a contented and comfortable life here in the World; and that they have then mo&s;t freedom to enjoy <HI>them&s;elves</HI> and their lot with &s;atisfac|tion, when they mo&s;t enjoy <HI>God:</HI> yea, that nearne&s;s and communion with him tendeth to the &s;ublimating and refining of their natural &s;pirit, and hath been an ob&s;ervable help to their very common abilities and parts.</P>
<P N="6">6. That there is truly a reality in the ble&s;&s;ing, which maketh a <HI>&s;mall</HI> thing &s;ignify <HI>much,</HI> and yield more than greater abundance.</P>
<P N="7">7. That when they give God their heart, it is then &s;weet and matter of &s;atisfaction, to ob&s;erve his
<PB N="82" REF="005185_0117_1016DA3566098898">
ways; and the ob&s;ervation is very refre&s;hing, how far the Lord conde&s;cends to their <HI>de&s;ires,</HI> when they &s;um them all up in him&s;elf, and make him their delight.</P>
<P N="8">8. That the <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> of Religion is in the <HI>practice</HI> thereof; and the way to have Religion ea&s;y, is to be throughly religious. Duty is then &s;weet, when men do it from an inward principle; and holine&s;s would be a more plea&s;ant work, yea, a reward to its &s;elf, if there were le&s;s mixture of hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P N="9">9. That real <HI>humility,</HI> and walking low in their own eyes, and before God, did never lo&s;e to them re|&s;pect and credit from men; but &s;elf-aba&s;ement doth ob&s;ervably go before lifting up, and true honour followeth &s;uch, who lea&s;t hunt after vain applau&s;e from the World.</P>
<P N="10">10. That when they were mo&s;t faithful to ob&s;erve and improve a <HI>little,</HI> then for their encouragement <HI>more</HI> hath been added; and they never wanted matter and motive to be thankful, when opportunities were im|proved and taken hold of for that end: yea, they have found there is a mercy within a mercy, and &s;ome pe|culiar mercy in every cro&s;s, which is only found and brought forth by the exerci&s;ed &s;erious <HI>improver</HI> of the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="11">11. That much &s;incerity hath al&s;o much &s;en&s;e fol|lowing the &s;ame; &s;ecret hone&s;ty before <HI>God</HI> hath met them openly before men, and faithfulne&s;s in Chri&s;tian freedom purcha&s;ed them more favour and re&s;pect, even from the wor&s;t, than when they &s;tudied mo&s;t to plea&s;e them in a &s;inful way.</P>
<P N="12">12. That they never &s;aw &s;o clearly the gain and real advantage of Godline&s;s, &amp; what a difference there is betwixt tho&s;e that &s;erve God, and tho&s;e that &s;erve him not, as in a time of <HI>trouble</HI> and &s;trait; how then tenderne&s;s in their former walk, and that which they entertained in the morning, doth now meet them at
<PB N="83" REF="005185_0118_1016DA7FF62488E0">
night, and pay them home with advantage in an hour of temptation.</P>
<P N="13">13. They have been forced to ob&s;erve, that there is an invi&s;ible <HI>guard</HI> about his People in their duty; that the Mini&s;try of the Angels towards &s;uch is no delu|&s;ion, and have oft been made to wonder how hazard within an hair breadth hath been prevented; relief, and help come as betwixt the bridge and the water; how they have been &s;en&s;ibly pre&s;erved amid&s;t greate&s;t dan|gers, while (as it were) an inhibition hath been &s;erved upon the&s;e, that they &s;hould come near, but not hurt, and only meet with them, that they might read their pre&s;ervation from them.</P>
<P N="14">14. That an enlarged heart doth meet with an en|larged <HI>allowance;</HI> and bearing burden with <HI>others</HI> of the People of God, hath helped to make their <HI>own</HI> pri|vate burden the lighter.</P>
<P N="15">15.

We are not here to under&s;tand the threatnings of <HI>vindictive wrath</HI> (from which believers are freed in in Chri&s;t) but of a <HI>fatherly</HI> di&s;plea&s;ure, which becau&s;e of &s;in may draw deep, yea, bring forth very dreadful effects, to witne&s;s that <HI>it is an evil and bitter thing to depart from God,</HI> and that <HI>their own doings &s;hall cha&s;|ti&s;e them;</HI> and the&s;e threatnings of the Covenant, <HI>If thy children for&s;ake my Law, I will puni&s;h their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion with rods, &amp;c.

<P N="4">4.

<P><HI>FIRST. Security and carnal confidence,</HI> which we find the word doth threaten, is one evil where|with Chri&s;tians are ready to be overtaken; but they
<PB N="86" REF="005185_0121_1016DA38B7F30750">
do al&s;o know by &s;ad experience, what <HI>bitter fruit</HI> this brings forth, and that therein the word falleth not to the ground, which is held forth in <HI>Ho&s;</HI> 2. 1, 9. <HI>Ho&s;</HI> 7. 9. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 30. 16, 17.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that a <HI>&s;ecure</HI> condition is the u&s;ual <HI>forerunner</HI> of &s;ome <HI>&s;ad change;</HI> that when they are mo&s;t <HI>at ea&s;e</HI> in a dull and dead temper of &s;pirit, &s;ome <HI>&s;harp</HI> rou&s;ing di&s;pen&s;ation is upon the back of it; either a <HI>gro&s;s &s;in,</HI> or a <HI>&s;earching cro&s;s,</HI> as a thorn in the bed of their &s;e|curity, to <HI>drive them to their feet.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That <HI>&s;eldom-reckoning</HI> with con&s;cience, the run|ning on of counts for &s;ome time upon their hand, doth <HI>ravel their ca&s;e,</HI> unto a &s;ad confu&s;ion, and maketh it a bitter and heartle&s;s work to retire alone, or within them&s;elves; yea, hath a mo&s;t direct tendency to a further <HI>hardening,</HI> and real de&s;ert of their duty.</P>
<P N="3">3. That when &s;ecurity and deadne&s;s groweth <HI>with|in,</HI> it quickly maketh them dry up and wither <HI>with|out,</HI> in the external performance of duty, and in that vigorous lively appearance, which did formerly brighten their walk and carriage before others, &s;o as very by|&s;tanders may read the langui&s;hing of <HI>grace,</HI> in the dead exerci&s;e of their <HI>gifts.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That going about duty with mo&s;t <HI>confidence in them&s;elves</HI> doth u&s;ually give them the mo&s;t clear di&s;|covery of their <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> yea, when they have <HI>lea&s;t lookt</HI> for any cro&s;s, they have then been &s;ure to meet with it, with that &s;ad addition, of being a <HI>&s;urprizal</HI> in a &s;ecure condition: whereas, on the other hand, they may tell what refre&s;hing di&s;appointments they have got, where &s;ome trials have been mo&s;t feared and lookt for.</P>
<P N="5">5. That &s;ecure <HI>&s;porting</HI> with a <HI>temptation</HI> may &s;oon turn to <HI>&s;ad earne&s;t;</HI> they have found it very hard to dance about the fire, and not be burnt: and the temp|tation, which at a <HI>di&s;tance</HI> &s;eemed &s;mall, upon a nearer <HI>approach</HI> they have found had more bands on their

heart, and was another thing than they could have be|lieved.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the <HI>means,</HI> whereon they have laid <HI>mo&s;t weight,</HI> they have al&s;o found to have given them the &s;adde&s;t <HI>di&s;appointment:</HI> the putting of them in God's room, and out of their own place, hath been the way to cau&s;e them to mi&s;carry; yea, to turn their cro&s;s. Whereas they have oft &s;een &s;ome thing <HI>unexpected,</HI> made the mean of their help, that they might know means are <HI>ordered of the Lord,</HI> and are u&s;eful, be|cau&s;e he maketh them &s;o.</P>
<P N="7">7. Their experience can al&s;o witne&s;s, that carnal <HI>confidence</HI> de&s;pi&s;ing the trial at a <HI>di&s;tance,</HI> is u&s;ually puni&s;hed with carnal <HI>diffidence</HI> and de&s;pondency of &s;pirit <HI>under</HI> the &s;ame; one extremity made the puni&s;h|ment of the other, like the hot and cold fits of an ague, which do mutually make one the other more inten&s;e: yea, that their immoderate confidence and expectation of a thing, hath after re&s;olved in as im|moderate di&s;couragement as their &s;troke.</P>
<P><HI>SECOND.</HI> The <HI>Chri&s;tians Unwatchfulne&s;s</HI> and intermitting in the exerci&s;e of that &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and commanded duty, we find the Word threateneth, and holdeth forth the hazard thereof, <HI>Le&s;t ye enter into Temptation,</HI> the verifying whereof their experience can al&s;o witne&s;s. Luk. 21. 34. 36. Matth. 26. 41.</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is not ea&s;y to guide their <HI>walk</HI> and con|ver&s;ation, when their guard over the <HI>heart</HI> doth &s;lac|ken; but the giving loo&s;e reins for a little may make &s;uch a &s;ad and large breach, that many (many) days will not ea&s;ily make up: yea, they do al&s;o know, how a &s;en&s;ible withdrawing of the Spirit, and drying up their life and liberty, is the u&s;ual fruit, which <HI>un|watchfulne&s;s</HI> brings forth.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="88" REF="005185_0123_1016DA41A02C1968">
2. That this helpeth to make their &s;un-&s;hines <HI>tran&s;ient,</HI> and cau&s;eth a low ebb after the greate&s;t en|largement, whil&s;t they <HI>do not guard</HI> again&s;t their pe|culiar evils; and that u&s;ually there doth haunt &s;uch a condition the &s;welling of the <HI>fle&s;h</HI> (when the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> is mo&s;t enlarged) which will &s;oon put them as far behind, as they formerly thought them&s;elves at an advantage.</P>
<P N="3">3. That when once the heart lieth <HI>open,</HI> it is quick|ly &s;ei&s;ed on and made a <HI>prey;</HI> with what a bitter <HI>&s;ting</HI> doth it return: after it hath taken liberty to <HI>wander?</HI> yea, doth find there is a <HI>&s;wift</HI> progre&s;s, that <HI>&s;in</HI> hath from the <HI>thoughts</HI> to the rolling of it to the <HI>imagination,</HI> and thence to the <HI>affection,</HI> wherewith it is more ea&s;y to engage, than to &s;hake this off.</P>
<P N="4">4. That <HI>unwatchfulne&s;s</HI> hath oft turned the mo&s;t &s;pecial times and opportunities for advantage, to the greate&s;t <HI>lo&s;s;</HI> which, through their neglect of the&s;e, hath put them further behind, then they were: it hath turned their <HI>retirement</HI> and &s;olitude, to be their &s;nare; made the de&s;ert wor&s;e and more dangerous, than the city; and made them find, that <HI>vain thoughts,</HI> the following whereof &s;eemeth plea&s;ant to the mouth, will prove gall and wormwood in the belly; there being no &s;adder company, than a man's <HI>&s;pirit</HI> let loo&s;e upon it &s;elf, whil&s;t they cannot &s;top that current, whereto they had given a vent.</P>
<P N="5">5. Their experience of this can witne&s;s that <HI>un|watchfulne&s;s</HI> hath an undoubted tendency to <HI>ca&s;t of prayer.</HI> How hard is it, in the evening to <HI>retire</HI> to God, whil&s;t the heart is <HI>abroad</HI> all the day? To be Religious in <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> when men are not &s;o in their <HI>walk;</HI> Yea, they do find, that this will bring their di&s;temper within, out of doors; to &s;ome di&s;order, im|pertinency or pa&s;&s;ion in their words, or outward com|munication: a thing, which experience may tell, doth

wound the &s;oul, make a &s;ad breach in their peace, and doth quickly overcloud the Spirit, and unfit them for communion with God, and going about of &s;piritual duties.</P>
<P><HI>THIRD. To re&s;train Prayer, and neglect calling on God, is an evil al&s;o which the Word doth threaten,</HI> and hold forth the &s;ame hazard thereof, as of unwatch|fulne&s;s, <HI>le&s;t ye enter into temptation;</HI> yea, that this is even a &s;tep to the <HI>ca&s;ting off fear,</HI> the Chri&s;tians ex|perience, from frequent trial can witne&s;s, that this Scripture threatning is true, Matth 26. 41. Job. 15. 4.</P>
<P N="1">1. That they have found this the ri&s;e, which giveth <HI>life</HI> and <HI>increa&s;e</HI> to their prevailing <HI>evils;</HI> and that corruption then is upon a &s;en&s;ible growth, as the lively exerci&s;e of <HI>prayer</HI> begins to be intermitted.</P>
<P N="2">2. That this <HI>weareth out</HI> their &s;piritual <HI>life,</HI> and bringeth a con&s;umption upon the vital &s;pirits of Chri|&s;tianity; &s;o that tho&s;e who &s;ometime <HI>flouri&s;hed,</HI> and kept green (as by the <HI>&s;cent of water</HI>) that corre&s;pondence, which they had with the fountain of their life, while his <HI>dew</HI> did <HI>lie all night on their branches,</HI> hath through neglect of <HI>prayer</HI> been brought to a poor <HI>&s;hadow;</HI> &s;o al|though &s;ometimes the greatne&s;s of their lo&s;s and di&s;|temper hath been hid from them&s;elves, yet might be ea&s;ily di&s;cerned by lookers on.</P>
<P N="3">3. That wearing out of <HI>prayer</HI> and of <HI>delight</HI> therein will quickly make them <HI>di&s;reli&s;h</HI> any <HI>other</HI> piece of Religion; put them out of frame to meditate, or to give thanks, or entertain fellow&s;hip with the Saints; yea, the more lively and &s;piritual the&s;e are, it maketh them the more a burden and torment to them.</P>
<P N="4">4. That wearing out of this is a &s;trong temptation to a <HI>further forbearance,</HI> and will &s;en&s;ibly wear them out of any &s;en&s;e of their <HI>need</HI> hereof, and make them &s;trangers to them&s;elves and to their own ca&s;e:
<PB N="90" REF="005185_0125_1016DA432E2CE858">
&s;o that they &s;hall find, the le&s;s they are in this exer|ci&s;e, the further they &s;hall be indi&s;po&s;ed; and the fewer errands they have, the le&s;s felt nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="5">5. Their experience can al&s;o witne&s;s, that <HI>little pray|er</HI> maketh a <HI>heavy burden;</HI> doth multiply their &s;traits; and cau&s;e their care to grow, as this is abated they mu&s;t then bear their burden alone, and with heavine&s;s take coun&s;el within them&s;elves, while they ply not this ble&s;t tried remedy, to make their reque&s;ts in all things known to God.</P>
<P><HI>FOURTH. We find the Word doth threaten D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ction from the Truth,</HI> and turning from the way of God in a time of trial, as an evil, into which tho&s;e that are kept by grace from final apo&s;ta&s;ie, may yet thro' the violence of a temptation fall. <HI>Jerem.</HI> 9. 13. 15. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 89. 30, 32. <HI>Jos.</HI> 8. 11. and their &s;ad ex|perience can witne&s;s the truth of the Scripture-threat|nings concerning this al&s;o, while they have found,</P>
<P N="1">1. That in <HI>one day</HI> they may adventure on that, which through mo&s;t of their life they have not got over, but it hath made them go with their back bo|wed down to the grave: that their giving the Lord's work a <HI>wrong touch,</HI> is one of tho&s;e things which doth &s;carcely leave them all their time; but, beyond other &s;ins, they have found this &s;till come up with a bitter and heavy reflexion: yea, in the evening of their life they have found this &s;o &s;ore on their &s;pirit, that it could not lie hid or &s;ilent, but they were forced to witne&s;s their &s;en&s;e of it before the World, ere they could obtain any ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. That this the Lord doth u&s;ually meet, with &s;ome <HI>&s;harp</HI> and <HI>publick reproof,</HI> even before men; that though he pardon his People, yea, give &s;ome &s;en|&s;ible intimation thereof to their &s;ouls, yet he hath no pa&s;t them, as to &s;ome vi&s;ible mark of his di&s;plea&s;ure becau&s;e of &s;uch a thing.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="91" REF="005185_0126_1016DA8BF50359A0">
3. They &s;ee, that a <HI>crooked</HI> and <HI>uncleanly way</HI> proves not the mean of <HI>extricating</HI> them out of trou|ble; but their &s;traits have been made to <HI>grow</HI> there|with: yea, they have found, that which they e&s;chew|ed in God's way, hath more &s;adly acco&s;ted them in another road; and that there is a thick dreg in the bottom of the cup, which maketh it wor&s;e to drink thereof at the clo&s;e, than at the beginning.</P>

<P>The 2d. te&s;timony I &s;hall here offer is from a grave an eminent mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t in our own Church within the&s;e few years, Mr. GEORGE GILLESPIE; who near his death did declare to tho&s;e who were by, what a large proof he had, and a&s;&s;ured per&s;wa&s;ion of the truth of the Scripture from <HI>experience;</HI> that he knew &s;o well what adventuring on the word was, and what it was to live on divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and be thus in all his concernments carried through, that he could not de&s;ire, were he to live in the world, a more de&s;irable and &s;atisfying life, than that of a continued reliance and depending on the Lord: and truly among&s;t many notable experiments that man of God had thereof, this was one very convincing, how in a &s;trange land, whither he was called on the &s;ervice of the Church, and in a grave a&s;&s;embly of ma|ny of the greate&s;t divines in that age, when one day he was &s;urpri&s;ed with an unexpected rencounter of a learn|ed Man Mr. <HI>Selden,</HI> who came on de&s;ign, with &s;ome others of that party upon the <HI>Era&s;tian</HI> intere&s;t, to debate for it, by the &s;tronge&s;t arguments which they had then praemeditated for its defence; whil&s;t none ap|peared in that great a&s;&s;embly to give a return, though there were many &s;ingularly learned and able, he did on an immediate reliance on God adventure (le&s;t the adver&s;ary &s;hould take advantage thereat) and gave

a &s;hort account of tho&s;e arguments adduced, wherein the &s;trength of his di&s;cour&s;e did mo&s;t lie, with &s;o clear and &s;atisfying an an&s;wer as a&s;toni&s;hed all; yea, did &s;i|lence the adver&s;ary, with a marvellous conviction.

<HEAD>The SECOND ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Our SECOND Argument, to demon&s;trate the accom|pli&s;hment of the Scripture, is this, that not only Chri&s;ti|an experience, but the ob&s;ervation of the Church and people of God, doth in all ages bear witne&s;s thereto, how the Lord's way in the&s;e providences both of mercy and judgment, about the Church, amid&s;t the various changes of her condition, yea, in the mo&s;t &s;trange things which fall out in the world, doth convincingly an&s;wer the word, and verify the &s;ame.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is indeed undeniable that the Scripture of God, as it is written to the per&s;onal ca&s;e of his people, and doth in their experience take place; &s;o is there a part of it in a peculiar way directed to the <HI>Church,</HI> the fulfilling whereof in the providences and events of the time &s;hould be the &s;ubject of our <HI>ob&s;ervation,</HI> and would &s;ingularly help to confirm our faith of the truth thereof.</P>
<P>For pro&s;ecuting this argument I would touch it a little in the&s;e three branches.</P>
<P N="1">1. How the&s;e <HI>general promi&s;es</HI> which belong to the <HI>Church</HI> univer&s;al, and concern her in all ages, have an accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P N="2">2. How the&s;e <HI>threatnings</HI> al&s;o of the word, which do not only concern the Church, but have a re&s;pect to her <HI>adver&s;aries,</HI> are certainly fulfilled, and take place in men's ob&s;ervation, who do ob&s;erve the judg|ments of their time.</P>
<P N="3">3. How the Scripture of God doth clearly &s;hine upon the <HI>darke&s;t foot&s;teps of Providence,</HI> even the&s;e which would &s;eem mo&s;t &s;trange and hard to under|&s;tand, &s;o that it may be demon&s;trate nothing falleth out in the world, or befalleth the &s;aints, but what is mo&s;t con&s;onant to the Scripture.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="branch">
<PB N="120" REF="005185_0155_1016DABF83AA85B8">
<P>FIRST BRANCH. As to the fir&s;t branch of this argument, I &s;hall but in&s;tance five <HI>general pro|mi&s;es</HI> which we find held forth in the word con|cerning the <HI>Church;</HI> and endeavour to &s;hew how very clear and obvious the accompli&s;hment of them is, if men do not willingly &s;hut their own eyes.</P>
<P>FIRST Promi&s;e, wherein we find the Scripture expre&s;s, is the <HI>pre&s;ervation of the Church:</HI> that he <HI>will be with her to the end of the World,</HI> and though he make an end of other nations, yet, will he <HI>not make an utter end of her,</HI> but while the ordinances of the &s;un, and the moon do la&s;t, and as the days of heaven, &s;o <HI>&s;hall her days be prolonged; again&s;t her the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail. Jer.</HI> 30. 11. <HI>Math.</HI> 16. 18. Now that God hath truly verified this his pomi&s;e, and is as good as his word, is a truth, though marvellous, yet, &s;o very clear, and manife&s;t, that I am &s;ure no athei&s;t can deny, it may be &s;o ea&s;ily demon&s;trated.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that the <HI>Church</HI> doth <HI>continue,</HI> and is kept alive to this day, it doth certainly prove the truth of his promi&s;e. For it can be &s;aid of her, and none can &s;ay it is a lye, &s;he hath outlived all her oppo&s;ers, the greate&s;t of whom have found their grave in the quar|rel, over who&s;e tomb that la&s;t confe&s;&s;ion of a great ad|ver&s;ary, <HI>Julian,</HI> may be written, <HI>vici&s;titandem, G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">liloe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Hath not this deadly and irreconcileable &s;eed been perpetuated from fathers to children! but who hath pro&s;pered in that enterpri&s;e! the archers have oft &s;hot, and wounded her &s;ore, but her bow doth abide in &s;trength, as at this day, this is her <HI>motto, Per&s;ecuted, but not for&s;aken? ca&s;t down, but not di&s;couraged.</HI> She who hath brought many children, yet cea&s;eth not to bear, who&s;e age hath not marred her beauty, her eyes are not dim, nor her &s;trength failed; a &s;ight which may cau&s;e us no le&s;s to <HI>&s;tand</HI> and <HI>con&s;ider this great
<PB N="121" REF="005185_0156_1016DB0EC0CAFCD8">
wonder,</HI> then <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did, at that which was but the &s;hadow and emblem thereof, <HI>a bu&s;h burning, and not con&s;umed.</HI> For, behold, a Church kept alive, yet, &s;till in the flames! and when to appearance con&s;umed, it doth ari&s;e more glorious out of her own a&s;hes! This is indeed the only <HI>Phoenix,</HI> and we know no other, of whom that can be &s;aid. Hath &s;he not born out tho&s;e univer&s;al deluges, which did like an inundation go over her head, of idolatry and pagani&s;m in the fir&s;t times, and Antichri&s;tiani&s;m with Ariani&s;m in the af|ter-ages; yet not &s;wallowed up! Which may be no le&s;s marvellous, than when &s;he was kept <HI>above the waters, in the ark:</HI> and though her enemies have oft &s;ung her funeral &s;ong, and rejoyced over the <HI>dead bo|dies of her witne&s;&s;es,</HI> yet, they have <HI>ri&s;en</HI> again; her <HI>dry bones have taken life, and come together;</HI> and behold &s;he is alive at this day.</P>
<P N="2">2. Not only the Churches pre&s;ervation, but the <HI>continued &s;eries</HI> and <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> thereof unto this time, doth witne&s;s the fulfilling of this promi&s;e: that in the darke&s;t times of her condition, &s;he hath not alto|gether di&s;appeared, even, when &s;he was &s;o long hid in the wilderne&s;s, but &s;till in every age had &s;ome <HI>witne&s;&s;es;</HI> and though the Church hath oft cried out for the want of <HI>Children,</HI> and been heard weeping, bemoaning her &s;elf becau&s;e they <HI>were not,</HI> yet, we may &s;ay &s;he never wanted an off-&s;pring to this day; &s;he did never die without an heir, and &s;eed of her own, to <HI>rai&s;e up her name,</HI> even &s;ince the Covenant was fir&s;t made with her in <HI>Adam's</HI> family. And though <HI>particular</HI> Churches have their &s;et times, which like the &s;un, have the u&s;ual periods, their height and flouri&s;hing, and afterwards a gradual decay, making way to the departure of light; yet, this made never void the promi&s;e of God to the Church <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> who&s;e lamp was never put out, nay, &s;hall not while the days of heaven do la&s;t.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="122" REF="005185_0157_1016DAC34BCA4B98">
2. We mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ay that the continuance and pre|&s;ervation of the Church is <HI>peculiar to her alone;</HI> and can be &s;aid of no other intere&s;t and party beneath the &s;un. For it is clear, that there was no Kingdom or Empire &s;o firmly rooted, no &s;ociety &s;o well governed by Laws, backed with power, which hath had the be&s;t title and claim, but Time at la&s;t did prevail over it, and made the &s;ame a trophe of her con|que&s;t; yea, the greate&s;t Monarchies, and flouri&s;hing Cities have at la&s;t yielded, &s;o as of them it may be &s;aid, <HI>Nunc &s;eges e&s;t ubi Troia fuit.</HI> But time cannot to this day boa&s;t of a triumph over the Church of God: though no nation, no family in the earth could ever plead antiquity with her.

<P N="4">4.

<P N="1">1. That <HI>va&s;t extent</HI> which the Kingdom of Chri&s;t hath had in the World.

For I mu&s;t think, even by-&s;tanders, &s;uch who never knew any &s;aving work of the Spirit, but live in the&s;e parts where the ordinances are di&s;pen&s;ed with

purity and power, if they &s;hut not their eyes, may oft clearly &s;ee <HI>&s;omething going forth</HI> with the word, that is beyond words, a <HI>divine Spirit</HI> and <HI>power,</HI> which &s;endeth forth its favour in the daily admini|&s;tration of the Go&s;pel; yea, by its <HI>effects,</HI> and &s;ome convincing di&s;covery thereof, doth force this truth in upon men's con&s;ciences, who are otherways &s;tran|gers thereto.</P>
<P>Now to hold forth the accompli&s;hment of &s;o great a promi&s;e, that God is faithful and true therein, I would give in the&s;e clear and convincing witne&s;&s;es to the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e excellent <HI>gifts</HI> and <HI>endowments</HI> given to the Church, are they not a vi&s;ible proof of this truth? For it is undeniable, where once the Go&s;pel cometh, that <HI>in&s;truments</HI> are rai&s;ed with <HI>another &s;pirit; rea|pers</HI> &s;ent forth, while there is a <HI>harve&s;t</HI> to be gathe|red, and &s;haped for their work; yea, tho&s;e who were of mean and ordinary parts, when called forth to the &s;ervice of the Church, will have another lu&s;tre; that it may be oft &s;een with a&s;toni&s;hment, how far not only they exceed them&s;elves, but tho&s;e who were of more eminent natural endowments. I would but &s;eri|ou&s;ly a&s;k men who never laid this truth to heart, Whence is that variety of Gifts, &s;o &s;utably di&s;pen&s;ed to the various employments, and different pieces of &s;ervice, the Church doth call for? How are they thus &s;uted to the &s;everal times; yea, to the very ge|nius and temper of &s;uch a time? Whence is it, that every gift and qualification is &s;o fitted and di&s;po&s;ed for its proper u&s;e; &s;ome mo&s;t peculiarly &s;haped out to awake and threaten (tho&s;e <HI>Boanerges</HI>) while others are &s;et forth with a &s;pirit eminently fitted to comfort; &s;ome mighty in per&s;wa&s;ion, yet not &s;o fit to expound; others mo&s;t dexterous to in&s;truct, yet not &s;o pow|erful to apply; &s;ome having the gifts of tongues, and others the tongue of the learned to &s;peak a word in &s;ea|&s;on
<PB N="132" REF="005185_0167_1016DAD05922A970">
to the weary; to &s;ome the face of a lion is given, when a heroick &s;pirit of courage and re&s;olution is called for, and to others the face of a calf, for patient en|during in &s;uffering time! Surely it were a choice me|ditation, to think how with as great wonder we may &s;ay of this excellent body of the Church, as of the natural body of man, how curiou&s;ly, yea, marvel|lou&s;ly is it framed; where every part doth an&s;wer an|other, and to the u&s;e of the whole, each hath its pe|culiar excellency, and &s;omething proper to every one's gift may be then &s;een, as well as in the face of man, by which in &s;ome things they differ from all o|ther.</P>
<P N="2">2. The&s;e more <HI>eminent extraordinary out pourings of the Spirit</HI> do al&s;o witne&s;s this truth; which at &s;ome &s;pecial times, when the Churches nece&s;&s;ity requireth it, have been mo&s;t di&s;cernable. When the Lord &s;endeth forth his &s;ervants about a more then ordinary piece of work, either to do, or &s;uffer; when he is to plant the Church in &s;ome place, where the Go&s;pel will meet with much oppo&s;ition; is it not then ma|nife&s;t, how &s;ome more than ordinary power and irre|&s;i&s;tible efficacy doth accompany the truth, before which there is no &s;tanding? The di&s;puter is then, in his rea&s;oning, confounded by &s;omething above rea&s;on; the untoward and rude are forced to &s;toop before the word, and to confe&s;s they have to do, with po|wer, and not with words; yea, tho&s;e whom the Lord maketh u&s;e of, who were feeble and weak as others, in that day are made as a brazen wall, and a fenced city.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is it not al&s;o undenyable, that now under the New Te&s;tament there are <HI>Mini&s;ters of the Spirit,</HI> and <HI>not of a dead letter,</HI> and empty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound?

even tho&s;e who know not what the Spirit is, are made to &s;ee &s;omething therein which doth dazle them with a&s;toni&s;hment.

And I would a&s;k, whence is it the word giveth law to men's con&s;ciences? that it &s;hould &s;peak with &s;uch an authority, as maketh them all to &s;hiver, that even the wor&s;t of men are &s;ome times made to &s;tand before the mini&s;try of the word, like men &s;tanding at the barr, upon life and death, before a judge who&s;e authority they dur&s;t not decline!</P>
<P N="4">4. It is very di&s;cernable, what a <HI>great difference</HI> and <HI>another appearance,</HI> there is both on Mini&s;ters, and Chri&s;tians <HI>at one time,</HI> from what they are at <HI>ano|ther,</HI> in the di&s;charge of duty, as if the&s;e were not the &s;ame per&s;ons; which appeareth not only in the enlargement, and &s;traitning of their gift, but al&s;o in power and life. Is it not &s;een, with what li|berty the&s;e do &s;ome times <HI>pray,</HI> and are as a Ship with a full gale before the wind? That it is then ea&s;y to <HI>preach;</HI> when at other times there is like a &s;hut door, that even hearers may perceive a &s;en&s;ible langui&s;hing, and them hampered in their very expre&s;&s;ions, yea, as men rowing again&s;t a contrary wind; the word wanting that favour and relli&s;h it hath had at other times; and this not through a natural indi&s;po&s;ition, or want of preparation, but that which all who ever &s;erved God in the &s;pirit mu&s;t confe&s;s, hath mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly attended them when they have thought them&s;elves at the greate&s;t advantage, for going about duty: O who can deny this evidence of the &s;pirit, a thing in
<PB N="134" REF="005185_0169_1016DAD557293300">
all ages &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt, yea, even obvious to the wor&s;t of men!</P>
<P N="5">5. It is al&s;o clear, that where ever the Lord hath had a Church, at &s;ome &s;pecial turns of her condition there have u&s;ually been &s;ome more <HI>&s;olemn times</HI> of the &s;pirit, and <HI>high &s;pring-tides</HI> of the go&s;pel. There was indeed a marvellous flowing forth of the &s;pirit of God after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion, which like a mighty current did carry all before it; at which time more &s;ucce&s;s did follow one &s;ermon, than hath been by the mi|ni&s;try of many others in an age; this made the world wonder, as if &s;ome univer&s;al enchantment had fallen on men; what that could be, which the more they &s;ought to bear down, the more it increa&s;ed, that made the rich choo&s;e poverty, and tho&s;e who dwelt in palaces betake them&s;elves with chearfulne&s;s to the dens and caves of the earth. But be&s;ides this, it is very manife&s;t, that in a large mea&s;ure the Spirit hath been let forth to the Church in after-ages; yea, there is no particular Church where the light hath &s;hined, but hath had it's &s;pecial times, &s;ome &s;olemn day of the pouring out of the &s;pirit, before the &s;un went down: which may be ob&s;erved either at the fir&s;t breaking out of the Go&s;pel, or at &s;ome other remarkable time and change of her condition; whence a great Flight of &s;ouls to Chri&s;t hath followed; be&s;ides the reaching of the con&s;cience and &s;tirring the affection of many o|thers under a common work of the &s;pirit, which u&s;ually goeth along with &s;olemn times.</P>
<P N="6">6. The going back of the tide, and <HI>vi&s;ible with|drawing of the Spirit from particular churches,</HI> where it hath &s;ometimes in a large mea&s;ure been let forth, is a very convincing witne&s;s to the truth of this pro|mi&s;e. For it is clearly &s;een, at what a &s;tand the Go&s;pel is in tho&s;e places were it mo&s;t eminently &s;hined; that the land which blo&s;&s;omed, and was like a wat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed gar|den,

hath been made as the heath in the wilderne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s; and then that the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, who&s;e lot hath fallen in &s;uch a time, are put to very &s;ore work, to work (as it were) with oars for want of wind, to ca&s;t out the net all night, and catch nothing; a &s;hut door is upon them in the exerci&s;e of their Mini&s;try; duty is made burden&s;ome, becau&s;e the Lord is again&s;t them, there is an evident re&s;traint upon the word, and its intercour&s;e is more with the ear, than with the con&s;ciences of men: yea, any liberty they find is to execute a commi&s;&s;ion of Judgment, and to denounce the wo of the Go&s;pel. O, doth not &s;o manife&s;t with|drawing of the Spirit witne&s;s the out-pouring thereof, and that it is a certain and real thing.</P>
<P N="7">7. Do not the <HI>&s;tirrings</HI> and &s;trong <HI>convictions,</HI> which even the <HI>wor&s;t of men</HI> have &s;ometimes under the word, witne&s;s a divine Spirit and power going along therewith; that which forceth an a&s;&s;ent from their con&s;cience to the truth, which otherways they hate; yea, maketh them for the time wonder they &s;hould not have been more &s;erious in the ways of God! Yea, it doth often put a thorn in the bed of their &s;ecurity! for indeed the word and the light thereof doth torment tho&s;e who dwell in the earth. And truly <HI>this is a marvellous thing,</HI> which get|teth in upon men's &s;ecret de&s;igns and coun&s;els, doth reveal to them the mo&s;t clo&s;e thoughts of their heart, which they are &s;ure men's eye could not reach, tak|eth them down through them&s;elves; and yet, that the world knoweth not whence it is! Yea, are they not forced to confe&s;s, what a great difference they find betwixt the word from the mouth of <HI>&s;ome</HI> who are holy and &s;erious, though held out in greate&s;t &s;implicity, than from <HI>others</HI> even of great|er gifts, and accompanied with more &s;hew of elo|quence, that &s;urely the one hath another &s;ound and reli&s;h, &s;peaketh more feelingly home to their

heart, than the mo&s;t poli&s;hed di&s;cour&s;e of greate&s;t orators!</P>
<P N="8">8. One witne&s;s more I &s;hall here give to the truth of this promi&s;e, even tho&s;e eminent <HI>examples of the great grace of God,</HI> which in every age have &s;hined in the firmament of the Church; &s;ome in love, and zeal, &s;ome in patience, and humility, &s;ome in the &s;trong acts of faith, and &s;elf-denial; which do certainly demon&s;trate a <HI>more excellent &s;pirit,</HI> than that which is in the world; whence they appear with another lu&s;tre in their walk and carriage, and have a &s;weet and fragrant favour of <HI>the Spirit,</HI> to the very di&s;cerning of by-&s;tanders; which truly &s;heweth that <HI>his wind doth blow on his garden,</HI> when the &s;pices &s;end forth &s;o plea|&s;ant a Scent.</P>
<P><HI>FOURTH. We find an expre&s;s Promi&s;e in the word of Deliverance to the Church in a low and oppre&s;&s;ed condition;</HI> that &s;urely the Lord will plead her cau&s;e, will deliver his People when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eeth their &s;trength is gone, and &s;ave them from the hands of their enemies. <HI>P&s;.</HI> 18. 47, 48, 50. <HI>P&s;.</HI> 22. 4, 5. <HI>I&s;.</HI> 54. 17. <HI>I&s;.</HI> 51. 23.</P>
<P>It is true, this promi&s;e hath its bounds, limits, and provi&s;o's, which &s;hould be taken along in the ap|plication thereof. We know, the Covenant of God with particular Churches is <HI>conditional</HI> only; he promi&s;eth, that <HI>he will be with them, while they are with him:</HI> yea, it is oft &s;een (and there is no jarr here with this promi&s;e) that a People profe&s;&s;ing the Go&s;pel, confederate with God following duty, have even <HI>turned their back before the enemy,</HI> and in the holy providence of God have for a time been given up to their fierce rage and violence. But it is al&s;o &s;ure, that this promi&s;e hath an accompli&s;hment, and in the day of the Church's &s;trait the Lord hath oft appeared, by a &s;trong out&s;tretched hand
<PB N="137" REF="005185_0172_1016DB27A25D2268">
for her help; his own arm brought &s;alvation to his People, when they &s;ought to him: for <HI>God is known in her palaces for a refuge;</HI> yea, &s;urely the Church might oft &s;ing that &s;ong on &s;uch clear grounds, as though with <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;he had been &s;tanding at the red &s;ea, <HI>Thy right hand, O Lord, is full of power, thy right hand hath da&s;hed in pieces thy enemies.</HI> For what nation, or People is like this, to whom he hath &s;hewed &s;uch marvellous things?</P>
<P>Now to &s;hew forth the faithfulne&s;s of God in this promi&s;e, I would offer &s;ome few things that are a mo&s;t clear and undeniable witne&s;s thereto.</P>
<P N="1">1. There are few ages, but we have &s;ome <HI>re|cord of the church's condition,</HI> which hold forth &s;uch <HI>&s;ignal convincing providences of God,</HI> in behalf of his oppre&s;&s;ed church and people, as may be a mani|fe&s;t &s;eal to this truth. It is true, &s;ome times have been more remarkable for &s;uffering, times of Judgment and of a growing trial, wherein this truth hath <HI>not</HI> &s;o clearly &s;hined forth; yea, that long night which the church had under <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> might &s;eem to call it in que&s;tion: but neverthele&s;s, if men take a &s;erious View of the Lord's way, and the &s;eries of providence in ages pa&s;t, comparing one time with another, what the &s;traits and mo&s;t extream ca&s;e of the church hath at la&s;t re&s;olved in, they will find cau&s;e to cry with a&s;to|ni&s;hment, <HI>Great deliverances giveth he to his people,</HI> yea, <HI>the Lord hath done great things for them!</HI> I am &s;ure, were there a full record, with that true account which might be given, of tho&s;e more remarkable deliveran|ces, that <HI>particular churches</HI> have met with, &s;ince the fir&s;t planting of the Go&s;pel among them, wherein God's very immediate hand for their help hath been di&s;cernable, it would <HI>nonplus</HI> the World, and greate&s;t Athei&s;ts, about the real fulfilling of this promi&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>confe&s;&s;ions</HI> even of the Church's <HI>enemies</HI> hath oft witne&s;&s;ed this truth, that in pur&s;uing their
<PB N="138" REF="005185_0173_1016DADD5E9B7AD0">
malice, to trouble and undo <HI>her,</HI> they have but un|done <HI>them&s;elves;</HI> how tormenting di&s;appointments have cau&s;ed their very fle&s;h to pine away, and the clo&s;e and i&s;&s;ue of their rage forced this conviction from them at la&s;t, that the Church is a <HI>burden&s;ome &s;tone,</HI> to be lifted up; a party, with whom it is full of hazard to meddle. Have not &s;uch been made to di&s;cern &s;omething of a divine hand, &s;o clearly again&s;t them, bla&s;ting their coun&s;els and mo&s;t promi&s;ing at|tempts, as if their eyes with <HI>Balaam</HI> hath been open|ed to &s;ee the <HI>Angel</HI> in their way! Yea, in all ages it is known, how the con&s;cience even of the wor&s;t hath oft bewrayed &s;omething of a pre&s;aging fear, they have had, of tho&s;e whom they pur&s;ued with greate&s;t malice, and a dreadful impre&s;&s;ion they had of a praying people, and their prayers.</P>
<P N="3">3. This truth hath had the cleare&s;t witne&s;s <HI>in times of the Church's greate&s;t &s;trait</HI> and <HI>extremity;</HI> when difficulties have appeared in&s;uperable, and relief in an ordinary way of providence mo&s;t hopele&s;s; when vi&s;ible means have been withdrawn, <HI>all refuge fail|ed, and none to help;</HI> that in &s;uch a day <HI>the Lord hath been &s;een upon the mount,</HI> and unexpectedly by very &s;trange means brought deliverance to a broken, and almo&s;t ruined Church, even as it were betwixt the bridge and the water: &s;o that who would have a clear view of the accompli&s;hment of this promi&s;e, may but turn back on the&s;e more remarkable ex|tream exigences of the Church's condition, and there have it; how oft a &s;weet &s;un&s;hine that followed the mo&s;t dark and cloudy times, a raging &s;torm hath re&s;olved into a refre&s;hing calm; yea, that with a fur|ther growth of the Church's trial, and doubling of her burden, her enlargement and deliverance hath bro|ken out with tho&s;e great &amp; obvious remarks therein, that it was a convincing return of prayer and wre&s;t|ling, with a further addition of &s;ome new and &s;ingu|lar
<PB N="139" REF="005185_0174_1016DB2ABADE5BB8">
mercy there with, yea, &s;ome eminent act of judg|ment upon her adver&s;aries.</P>
<P N="4">4. The greate&s;t <HI>advantages</HI> and <HI>victories,</HI> which men have got over the Churches and people of God, can al&s;o bear witne&s;s to this, that <HI>when the wicked have &s;prung up like the gra&s;s, and the workers of iniquity &s;eemed to flouri&s;h,</HI> this very way hath the Lord taken to bring about a more <HI>full deliverance:</HI> Yea, on the other hand, hath it not been very ob|vious how the Church's <HI>gain</HI> hath been brought forth out of greate&s;t <HI>lo&s;s;</HI> that tho&s;e wounds which &s;eemed mo&s;t deadly, by the infinitely wi&s;e providence of God, have turned to her mo&s;t effectual and thorough <HI>cure;</HI> and men's unrea&s;onable violence and rage again&s;t the Church hath oft had an evident tendency to bring about even that whereto it &s;eemed mo&s;t directly con|trary, &s;ome further mercy, and deliverance, than could have been expected; as the <HI>Amorites</HI> refu|&s;ing <HI>I&s;rael</HI> but pa&s;&s;age through their land, did prove the very mean to give them more than they &s;ought, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that land for an inheritance.</P>
<P N="5">5. This witne&s;s the ob&s;ervation of the Church in all ages can bear to this promi&s;e, that deliverance hath oft &s;prung up, and been brought to her hand, <HI>from a quarter, and by &s;uch means, as none would have expected;</HI> by &s;uch, as <HI>none but God could do;</HI> a &s;udden report and rumour (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23. 27.) Means that have been not only &s;mall and improbable, but that looked directly <HI>contrary,</HI> as in bringing the Church out of <HI>Egypt;</HI> yea, &s;ometime by the <HI>wicked's being en&s;nared in the work of their own hands.</HI> Is it not obvious, how the Lord hath employ'd men's <HI>private</HI> intere&s;ts, to put them on for befriending his <HI>Church?</HI> and hath cau&s;ed <HI>the earth</HI> to <HI>help the woman,</HI> and rai|&s;ed up one oppre&s;&s;or to puni&s;h another; yea, often hath prepared carpenters, whence it was lea&s;t thought, to cut the horns of tho&s;e who had &s;cattered his people!</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="140" REF="005185_0175_1016DADF96253468">
6. There is this convincing witne&s;s to the truth of &s;uch a promi&s;e, <HI>that &s;udden remarkable change,</HI> which may be oft di&s;cerned both on men's inward frame, and the outward face of the Church, when a time of mercy and enlargement is come; in&s;tru|ments rai&s;ed of the Lord, with a di&s;cernable elevation of their &s;pirits to act, and <HI>do exploits;</HI> the feeble then made <HI>&s;trong;</HI> and tho&s;e who &s;ometime would have fainted at an ordinary piece of &s;ervice, dare with &s;uch a gale of divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance <HI>run</HI> (as it were) <HI>through a troop,</HI> and <HI>overleap a wall.</HI> For indeed this may in all ages be obvious, how ea&s;y it is to move, in the day when the Lord moveth for his people, and &s;trengthneth the girdle of their loins; that it was not their bow, or &s;word, which got them the victory, but the very finger of God, &s;omething above the coun&s;els of men, or ordinary means; which hath &s;ometimes been made clear as the noon-day, &s;o that even, at &s;ome di&s;tance, tho&s;e who are <HI>wi&s;e to di&s;cern the times,</HI> did &s;ee when there was a breaking out of a day of a Church's <HI>hope;</HI> how there was a previous motion and &s;tir among&s;t the <HI>dry bones;</HI> the Lord, as <HI>in the top of the mulberry trees,</HI> hath been then di&s;cer|nable, &amp; &s;ome promi&s;ing appearance from the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition &amp; temper of the Godly in that time (tho' we mu&s;t grant, mercy and &s;overeign grace hath oft met the Church, when little of this hath appeared) which, like the breaking out of that <HI>cloud</HI> in the top of mount <HI>Carmel,</HI> to the Prophet, though at fir&s;t but as an <HI>handbreadth,</HI> hath &s;hewed that deliverance to the Church was not far off.</P>
<P N="7">7. I would add this witne&s;s al&s;o; tho&s;e <HI>convinc|ing providences, which in all ages have been &s;hewed again&s;t the enemies</HI> of the Church, &s;uch as men could not pa&s;s without &s;ome remark: what an <HI>i&s;&s;ue</HI> tho&s;e have had, who have &s;ometimes been a &s;ore <HI>rod</HI> on the People of God, yea, <HI>a terror in the land of the
<PB N="141" REF="005185_0176_1016DB2C671ACDA0">
living!</HI> How they have become a mo&s;t abject and contemptible party, like bees who have lo&s;t their &s;ting; their countenance hath been changed, and they cea&s;ed to be any more a fear, when once <HI>their work was done,</HI> and the date of their commi&s;&s;ion for the humbling and trying of the Church expired; yea a <HI>judicial Stroke</HI> from the Lord hath been often &s;een upon their very judgment, and re&s;olutions, which could not then &s;erve them to trouble and afflict the Church; the day being turned, and the time of her deliverance come.</P>
<P><HI>FIFTH.</HI> There is this <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> al&s;o which concern|eth the Church in general, as well as Chri&s;tians in their per&s;onal ca&s;e, <HI>That all things work together for the good of tho&s;e who love God, Rom.</HI> 8. 28. the ac|compli&s;hment whereof, as it is written out in providence to the ob&s;ervation of men, I would here touch.</P>
<P>This is indeed a great and comprehen&s;ive promi&s;e, which in the con&s;tant cour&s;e and tenor of provi|dence about the Church, we may &s;ee, it doth take place; how tho&s;e turnings and changes of the World, the mo&s;t &s;trange emergents of the time, the various mo|tions and intere&s;ts of men, do co-operate together, and have an undoubted tendency to bring forth the Church's good, as though they did intentionally act for the &s;ame. There will indeed, one day, be a more clear and marvellous di&s;covery of this, when <HI>the Lord hath perfected his work, and the my&s;tery of God it fini&s;hed,</HI> the Church brought &s;afe to the harbour: then &s;hall it be fully manife&s;t, to what end all tho&s;e &s;torms and cro&s;s winds in the coun&s;els and de&s;igns of men were; tho&s;e things, which in the time could not be under&s;tood, but &s;eemed perplexed and &s;trange, did really work for the Church's good. For then men will &s;ee with their eyes a full performance of the word: yet we mu&s;t &s;ay, even here, in every
<PB N="142" REF="005185_0177_1016DAE42ADED2B0">
age, amid&s;t the various changes of the Church's ca&s;e, this hath &s;o clear a Fulfilment, that there is no &s;erious ob&s;erver of providence, but may bear wit|ne&s;s to it.</P>
<P N="1">1. That not only the <HI>Church's good,</HI> but even her <HI>greate&s;t</HI> good, hath mo&s;t clearly had its ri&s;e, and been brought forth, out of the <HI>greate&s;t mi&s;chiefs</HI> and <HI>hurts</HI> intended again&s;t her. If we &s;earch the Scripture, and will turn over tho&s;e after-records of the Church's condition, we &s;hall there find, that the mo&s;t remarkable attempts and plots, &s;uch as <HI>Pharaoh's</HI> la&s;t e&s;&s;ay to de|&s;troy the <HI>I&s;raelites, Haman's</HI> great de&s;ign to root out the &s;eed of the Jews, that great Ma&s;ter-plot Satan once had on foot, to cru&s;h the Go&s;pel and the Chri&s;|tian Church by crucifying her head, yea, in the&s;e la&s;t times <HI>Antichri&s;t's</HI> killing the witne&s;&s;es, have all, as if really intended by the in&s;truments as well as the fir&s;t mover, brought forth the Church's greate&s;t good; &s;o as the after-mercy and relief hath carried &s;ome vi&s;ible proportion to her trial, and to the greatne&s;s of her adver&s;aries de&s;ign.</P>
<P N="2">2. It may be al&s;o clear, if we but trace back tho&s;e <HI>memorable changes,</HI> which have been up and down the earth, how <HI>direct a tendency</HI> they have had to <HI>this end,</HI> Did not the bringing down that <HI>great image of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> witne&s;s this? We find <HI>Nebu|chadnezar</HI> rai&s;ed up as a rod to the Church, and <HI>Cy|rus</HI> for a deliverer; we may &s;ee the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Gre|cian</HI> Monarchies brought down, to make way for the &s;etting up of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias</HI> his Kingdom. <HI>Anti|ochus</HI> mu&s;t &s;tand up a little for a &s;harp trial, and his downfal give the Church a new breathing, and hold forth to after-ages a remarkable monument of the judgement of God again&s;t his enemies. Peaceable <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> mu&s;t fall in with his time <HI>in who&s;e days &s;hall be abundance of peace.</HI> We find a <HI>Titus</HI> &s;et up to execute the judgement of God on the Jews, to

make way for a further enlagement to the gentile Church; a <HI>Nero</HI> and <HI>Domitian</HI> to help forward the Churches &s;uffering, and a <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> to give her &s;ome re&s;t, after &s;o long and &s;ore an a&s;&s;ault; and at la&s;t, the <HI>Roman</HI> empire mouldred down, for <HI>Anti|chri&s;t's</HI> up &s;etting, to accompli&s;h what did remain of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, in his Church, by that ad|ver&s;ary.</P>
<P N="3">3. We may oft &s;ee a very <HI>&s;trange concurrence</HI> of things! how in&s;truments act to bring about the Lord's end, and advance his Church's intere&s;t, even while each one doth mo&s;t vigorou&s;ly drive their own proper end and de&s;ign; which &s;heweth, there is &s;urely a <HI>living &s;pirit in the wheels,</HI> that ordereth the&s;e motions, a &s;upream and fir&s;t mover that can thus determine them, whether they will, or not, to &s;erve his end, and to promote the Church's good, when they mo&s;t directly intend the contrary.</P>
<P N="4">4. We have &s;een how in men's plotting the ruin of the Church, there is oft <HI>an un&s;een hand determining their judgment and inclination,</HI> to fall upon that very <HI>way,</HI> than which we would think nothing could have been more direct for <HI>her good</HI> and their own <HI>ruin;</HI> how an <HI>Hu&s;hai</HI> hath been &s;ent in, or &s;ome have been &s;tirred up among&s;t them&s;elves (upon their own inte|re&s;t) to break the pernicious coun&s;els and de&s;igns of others.</P>

<HEAD>THE SECOND BRANCH</HEAD>
<P>DOth concern tho&s;e <HI>Scripture-threatnings, which are held forth in the word, with a re&s;pect to the vi&s;ible Church,</HI> and again&s;t a people profe&s;&s;ing the Go&s;pel; that no priviledges they have above others, &s;hall ex|empt them from judgment, yea &amp; from very &s;ad &s;trokes; he hath <HI>known them above the re&s;t of the World,</HI> he therefore will <HI>contend with them mo&s;t &s;everely,</HI> becau&s;e of &s;in, and &s;uch particular evils as we find the Word threatneth.</P>
<P>I touched a little &s;ome Scripture-threatnings, in the preceeding argument, as concerned Chri&s;tians in their private experience: what I here intend, is to point at this truth, as it is written in the providences and judgments of every time, to men's ob&s;ervation; how judgments from the Lord, which point, as with the finger, at the abounding &s;ins of that time, do reach <HI>a land,</HI> and <HI>particular Churches,</HI> according to the threatnings of the word. This is indeed manife&s;t, that the greate&s;t promi&s;es made to a people, we find backed with &s;ade&s;t threatnings: and accordingly we find, the greate&s;t monuments of wrath have u&s;ually been &s;et up, where &s;ometimes the large&s;t offers of the Go&s;pel were; yea, that the anger of the Lord may draw &s;o deep, again&s;t a people profe&s;&s;ing his name as to make their land de&s;olate, and the high ways thereof mourn; for in this precinct of the Church doth both judgment and mercy mo&s;t eminently &s;hine forth, and the Lord's way there doth differ from that he hath with any other people.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="005185_0181_1016DAE8DB4A1580">
Now to clear this grave truth a little, how tho&s;e threatnings of the word, again&s;t a nation and people, becau&s;e of &s;in, are al&s;o verified in their judgments, I &s;hall touch a few in&s;tances, that are mo&s;t known and obvious, where we may lay the word and ob|&s;ervation of the Church together, and &s;ee how they an&s;wer one the other.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We find the <HI>Threatnings of the word do point at the time of a people's judgment.</HI> 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 2. 16. <HI>Rev.</HI> 14. 15, 18. That when they <HI>fill up the mea&s;ure of their &s;in,</HI> and <HI>their cup is full,</HI> the Lord will not then defer the execution; until the cup of the <HI>Amorites</HI> was full, he did let them alone: and we find an&s;wer deferred, to the cry of <HI>the &s;ouls under the altar,</HI> for avenging their blood on Antichri&s;t, becau&s;e that ac|cur&s;ed party hath yet more to do again&s;t the Church, and the Saints more to &s;uffer under their hand.</P>
<P>Now to witne&s;s the accompli&s;hment of this; let us but con&s;ider what in all times may be ob&s;erved. Fir&s;t, that there is an ordinary <HI>growth</HI> and <HI>height of &s;in,</HI> which a land cometh to, <HI>before de&s;truction;</HI> &s;ome national and univer&s;al &s;preading thereof, prodi|gious outbreakings, the utter rejecting of reproof, which &s;hew that a people's ca&s;e mu&s;t then be on &s;ome turn; yea, that &s;trange and unu&s;ual &s;inning u&s;eth to go before &s;ome &s;trange &s;troke.&mdash;2. Before judgment come, is it not &s;een, how the &s;in of a people hath become &s;o <HI>daring,</HI> that it hath had a loud cry? yea, their ca&s;e hath been &s;uch as did ju&s;tify the Lord's procedure again&s;t them, even in the con&s;cience of all Ob&s;ervers, that he did it not without much cau&s;e.&mdash;3. Is it not ea&s;y, for &s;uch as are wi&s;e to know the times, to &s;ee <HI>night</HI> coming on a land, when &s;in is at &s;ome dreadful height, by con&s;idering the <HI>word</HI> and the Lord's u&s;ual <HI>way</HI> with a people in &s;uch a ca&s;e? Yea, have there not then been &s;ome &s;pecial <HI>forewarnings,</HI> a
<PB N="147" REF="005185_0182_1016DB36874FE708">
more then ordinary <HI>impre&s;&s;ion</HI> of judgment upon the &s;pirits of the <HI>godly,</HI> and the hiding of many of them in the <HI>grave;</HI> which, as threatning pre&s;ages, have &s;hewed the near approach of a &s;troke.&mdash;4. There doth not u&s;ually want even &s;ome <HI>Noah,</HI> or <HI>Jonas,</HI> the Mini&s;ters of God &s;ent forth to threaten, who as watchmen upon the wall are <HI>di&s;cerning hazard</HI> at a di&s;tance; yea, with an ob&s;ervable <HI>pre&s;&s;ure</HI> then upon their &s;pirit, and a more than ordinary <HI>agreement</HI> among&s;t them&s;elves, to <HI>cry out,</HI> and give the people <HI>warning,</HI> when the time of judgment hath been drawing near.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is clear, <HI>there are &s;ome &s;pecial evils and &s;ins of a time, which we find the word mo&s;t dreadfully doth threaten:</HI> yea, in a peculiar way it doth put a mark upon them, that though the Lord &s;hould pa&s;s by many infirmities in a Church and people profe&s;&s;ing his name; yet, for &s;uch and &s;uch &s;ins (as we find in <HI>Amos</HI> 1. 3.) <HI>he will not turn away the puni&s;hment thereof;</HI> but hath &s;olemnly declared, by his truth and faithfulne&s;s, that the&s;e &s;hall not pa&s;s without &s;ome vi&s;ible mark, even before the world, of his anger. Now in this the Scripture is clear, and lets us &s;ee, there are &s;ome &s;ins more particularly threatned, &s;ome land-de&s;troying &s;ins, that have as it were the mark &s;et on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which do e&s;pecially provoke the holy indignation and jealou&s;ie of God; &s;uch as <HI>ido|latry,</HI> corrupting the Wor&s;hip of God; <HI>Perjury, and Covenant-breaking,</HI>&mdash;Shall they break my Covenant, and e&s;cape? &s;aith the Lord, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 17. 15.

Yea, <HI>blood guil|tine&s;s,</HI> which the earth &s;hall not cover, and for which the &s;word &s;hall not depart, even from the hou&s;e and family of <HI>David.</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12. 10.</P>
<P>Now to evidence the accompli&s;hment hereof, I &s;hall point at &s;ome things mo&s;t obvious to the ob&s;er|vation
<PB N="148" REF="005185_0183_1016DAEAAC2E8FE8">
of every time, how terribly the Lord u&s;eth to plead, for &s;uch things, and by &s;ome exemplary &s;troke and judgment point them out, as we find them par|ticularly &s;et by them&s;elves in the word, and threat|nings thereof.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that in the&s;e &s;ins, thus marked, men may &s;ee how their <HI>judgments</HI> u&s;e not wholly to be <HI>deferred to another world,</HI> but though much is oft pa&s;&s;ed here, and laid over to that la&s;t and great judgment, yet, upon &s;uch &s;ins the Lord hath put &s;ome mark of his di&s;plea&s;ure, even in <HI>this life.</HI>&mdash;2.

It is rarely found, that &s;ome great revolt of a people from God, and breaking Covenant with him, doth lie long unpuni&s;hed, nor doth the hoary head of the violent and bloody man go oft to the grave in peace.&mdash;4.

yea, mini&s;ters have found mo&s;t di&s;couragement, to labour in tho&s;e parts where the word hath been long preached with power.&mdash;3.

<P>The word doth al&s;o threaten <HI>carnal Security</HI> (a di&s;|ea&s;e whereof the Church is oft in great hazard) yea, we find it holds forth a certain connexion betwixt &s;piritual judgments upon a People, and &s;ome outward &s;trokes to follow thereon; that tho&s;e who are under that fir&s;t wo and plague upon their <HI>&s;pirits,</HI> are then near to &s;ome judgment upon their <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> and may expect a &s;harp wakening; <HI>in hearing they &s;hall not under&s;tand,</HI> &amp;c. but the clo&s;e is, <HI>until their cities be con&s;umed without inhabitants,</HI> and <HI>there be an utter de&s;olation:</HI> yea, we find, judgment doth begin as a <HI>moth,</HI> in that 5<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> but in the 14<HI>th</HI> ver. it doth turn at la&s;t to be <HI>a lion.</HI> We may truly &s;ay, the fulfill|ing of this hath in all ages of the Church been obvious. 1.

<P>HAving &s;poke &s;omething how the Scripture both as to the promi&s;es, and threatnings thereof, is evidently fulfilled in the Lord's ordinary way of pro|cedure with his Church, I would a little further follow this argument, <HI>How this al&s;o hath a manifold accompli&s;h|ment, even in the&s;e mo&s;t &s;trange and dark pa&s;&s;ages of providence, whereat men are ready to &s;tumble</HI> and chal|lenge the &s;potle&s;s righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, and his faithfulne&s;s therein; but if we lay them to that mea|&s;ure, and line of the word which is &s;tretched over the whole work of providence, we will &s;ee how well the&s;e do agree, and an&s;wer one to the other, yea, that all the paths wherein God walketh towards his Church, and people, are &s;urely mercy, and truth.</P>
<P>To clear this I &s;hall point at &s;ome foot&s;teps of the providence of God in the world, and about the Church which would &s;eem mo&s;t dark, yea a contradiction to his word, and promi&s;e, but are plain and manife&s;t,

How the Church is oft at the brink of the grave even when her ca&s;e is upon a turn, and how it is congruous to his way (who&s;e paths are in the deep waters, who cloatheth him&s;elf with darkne&s;s, that men &s;hould not find any thing after him, or lay down ab&s;olute conclu&s;ions concerning his dealing) that the motions of provi|dence &s;hould be oft &s;o perplexed, and various&mdash;2.

<P N="10">10.

<P>It is true, tho&s;e &s;weet and &s;en&s;ible enjoyments, which the Saints have of this truth, the World cannot reach; but it is al&s;o &s;ure, that in every age, the works of the Lord, and &s;ome more remarkable convincing providences, both of judgment and mercy, do &s;olemnly invite men to ob&s;erve the accompli&s;hment of the word therein; yea, no time hath wanted &s;omething

of a publick witne&s;s from <HI>ungodly</HI> men, even greate&s;t <HI>mockers</HI> of Religion, who under that con&s;training power of con&s;cience at death, or in &s;ome day of their &s;trait, have been forced to &s;eal the truth, by a very open confe&s;&s;ion of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God to|wards them. And this is indeed the Lord's ble&s;&s;ed de&s;ign, in making his works &s;ometime &s;o con&s;picuous, that they may not only confirm the faith of his people, but render <HI>Athei&s;m</HI> inexcu&s;able; that the glory of his faithfulne&s;s, as well as of his power, and wi&s;dom, may &s;hine forth before the &s;ons of men. I confe&s;s, we may wonder why the <HI>World</HI> looketh &s;o little upon this; and how the conviction of &s;o great a truth, which they cannot &s;hun, doth not more pre&s;s them: but the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> doth fully re&s;olve this, <HI>The bruti&s;h man knoweth not, neither do fools lay to heart,</HI> how the Scripture taketh place, <HI>that flouri&s;h|ing of wicked men is but in judgment</HI> for their further ruin.</P>

<HI>FIRST.

<P><HI>SEVENTH.

It is true, that the Chri&s;tians lot is oft followed with much trouble, and &s;ometimes with lo&s;s of his life, which may &s;eem to have a very di&s;mal a&s;pect. For that great goodne&s;s, which the man who feareth God, hath en&s;ured to him, is much laid up in another world: but it is al&s;o &s;ure, that there are &s;uch clear convincing proofs of this truth held forth

<P N="1">1.

This in|deed is no romance; but a mo&s;t true hi&s;tory, which through all times, and many examples, might be written of the Word and providence, which would &s;urpa&s;s the riche&s;t fancy, that any fiction or romance did ever contain.</P>
<P N="3">3.

<P><PB N="237" REF="005185_0272_1016DC5A8038B3A0">
I have a little touched this in the &s;econd Argument how the accompli&s;hing of Scripture threatnings is witne&s;&s;ed to the ob&s;ervation of the <HI>Church,</HI> and to tho&s;e who are <HI>wi&s;e to di&s;cern the times,</HI> wherein they live. I &s;hall here point at this truth, as it is in the providence of God, written in &s;uch great letters, as are obvious to the view of the <HI>World,</HI> &s;o as mo&s;t common ob&s;ervers cannot pa&s;s this without a re|mark. It is true, much may be laid over to that great general a&s;&s;ize of the la&s;t judgment, that day of retri|bution; yea, &s;ometimes we &s;ee the mo&s;t wicked and vile go in peace to the grave; the &s;overeignty of God doth al&s;o appear very ob&s;ervably in the dif|ferent mea&s;ure and kind of puni&s;hment; and it is too evident, how prone men are to look more to the in|tere&s;t that &s;econd cau&s;es have in &s;uch a thing, than to a divine hand: but this is al&s;o &s;ure, that <HI>the Lord is known on the earth by the judgments which he executeth,</HI> and in every age doth &s;et up &s;uch convincing examples before men, that the greate&s;t Athei&s;t may &s;ee, yea, oft their con&s;cience mu&s;t break the jay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, re&s;train it as they will, and force this acknowledgement, that &s;uch judgments can be no ca&s;ual thing; while &s;omething of a power higher than man, and a clear verifying of the word, are &s;o di&s;cernable therein.</P>
<P>Now to demon&s;trate this truth, I would offer &s;ome things which may &s;hew how very near this cometh to the ob&s;ervation of men, &s;o as none can be a &s;trang|er thereto, or want conviction of this piece of the truth of God, except they willingly &s;hut their eyes, while it is clear,</P>
<P N="1">1.

<HI>puni&s;hed by a divine hand.</HI> We may &s;ay, time could never yet wear out the ob&s;ervation of this truth, through the World: &amp; though many things may be received and credited, which not having a &s;ure ground do quickly evani&s;h (it being truth's priviledge &s;till to out live fal&s;hood) yet it is &s;ure, how in the dark|e&s;t parts of the earth, this hath been &s;till noticed with a &s;pecial remark, &amp; tran&s;mitted from one age to another; yea, the records of the nations, even by heathen writers, &s;hew what remarkable puni&s;h|ment hath followed cruel oppre&s;&s;ion, Covenant-break|ing, and &s;uch other gro&s;s &s;ins again&s;t the &s;econd ta|ble; yea, how the&s;e have been the u&s;ual forerun|ners of great &s;trokes on Kingdoms and families.</P>
<P N="2">2.

When judgment is coming on a land, it may appear how <HI>in&s;truments</HI> are rai&s;ed, and in a more then ordinary way acted with all advantages for &s;uch a piece of &s;ervice.&mdash;(4.)

<P N="4">4.

<HI>wickedne&s;s,</HI> &s;uch as blood&s;hed; their former pro&s;|perity from &s;uch a day vi&s;ibly declining.&mdash;(2.)

Such who do not much con&s;ider God's controver&s;y, yet are oft forced to remark, that &s;ince &s;ome have medled or matched with <HI>&s;uch an hou&s;e,</HI> they have &s;adly &s;marted thereby, &s;omething of a <HI>cur&s;e</HI> even following the <HI>race</HI> and po&s;terity of &s;ome.&mdash;(4.) How <HI>&s;acrilegi|ous</HI> medling with that which hath been for a pious and publick u&s;e, hath cau&s;ed a vi&s;ible wa&s;te and con|&s;umption in their own e&s;tate.&mdash;(5.) That men's a&s;king coun&s;el from the <HI>Devil,</HI> &amp; turning to that quarter for their help, doth u&s;ually re&s;olve in a &s;ad and <HI>tragick</HI> clo&s;e; and truly this, many in the &s;hutting up of their life have been forced to confe&s;s.&mdash;(6.)

<P><HI>NINTH.

<P>I confe&s;s, it may cau&s;e fear &amp; a&s;toni&s;hment, to think on this, that &s;pirits &s;o knowing and once originally excellent, have fallen thus into &s;uch an height of in|dignation again&s;t infinite goodne&s;s, that it is now their only aim and plea&s;ure, to <HI>di&s;honour God,</HI> and <HI>de&s;troy his image in man.</HI> It &s;hould indeed cau&s;e us to fear him, that <HI>&s;pared not the Angels who &s;inned.</HI> But the truth it &s;elf is &s;ure, that &s;uch a party is at this day encompa&s;&s;ing the earth, and trafficking up and down there: to prove which by arguments, were to light a candle to let men &s;ee that it is day, while it is known what ordinary familiar conver&s;e many have therewith, and alas too ea&s;y to di&s;cern that <HI>power,</HI> which the <HI>prince of this World</HI> hath upon the <HI>children of di&s;o|bedience.</HI> How obvious are the marks of his conque&s;t almo&s;t every where; Thou&s;ands lying in his chains!

But there being no need for &s;uch a de|mon&s;tration, I only here aim to hold forth what a concerning truth this is, and of great con&s;equence, if &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered; yea, how both the Scripture, and Chri&s;tian Religion, is hereby evidently con|firmed &s;ince the&s;e things mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That in this the Scripture is truly fulfilled, which doth witne&s;s <HI>what</HI> the&s;e Spirits are, <HI>adver&s;aries</HI> to man; in their nature and Inclination de&s;perately evil; who&s;e actings in the earth have a vi&s;ible ten|dency to men's hurt and ruin; yea, their pretended &s;avours always directed to that end; whence we &s;ee &s;uch a natural inbred horror, which is in man again&s;t them.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it is no <HI>common</HI> thing, which they &s;o much pur&s;ue; &s;omething more precious than the body, for which &s;o great and cruel an adver&s;ary is in conti|nual labour; for their actings have no &s;uch tendency to ruin men's e&s;tate in the World: no, it is mo&s;t evi|dent, this is the <HI>&s;oul,</HI> the immortal &s;oul, to undo them in that great intere&s;t, is the mark, whereat they level; that poor man might be &s;harer of that mi&s;ery, under which <HI>they</HI> are concluded.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is it not an undeniable con&s;equence of this truth, that there mu&s;t be an <HI>invi&s;ible World,</HI> that hath inha|bitants of <HI>another kind</HI> than &s;uch as are here; that &s;ure there is &s;ome being above man; yea, a real corre&s;pon|dence betwixt men and Spirits?

For, this may be certain, that the&s;e who have &s;o great enmity to man who are &s;o near, and have &s;uch advantages over us, could not keep at &s;uch a di&s;tance, but that they are kept in chains by a higher power.</P>
<P N="5">5. How is it that <HI>now</HI> by the Go&s;pel and within this precinct of the Church, <HI>Satan's</HI> power is &s;o much <HI>re&s;trained,</HI> in re&s;pect of <HI>former</HI> times; while it is known, what a familiar conver&s;e they had with men, did e|ven haunt their hou&s;es, and were &s;o publick in their appearance under &s;uch names of <HI>Faries</HI> and <HI>Brounies,</HI> which &s;ince the breaking out of the light of the Go&s;pel hath not been?

<P N="1">1.

But O &s;hould it not put us to other thoughts, if we could have a &s;erious view of this?

I &s;hould be loath to borrow &s;o much of your time, by any di&s;|cour&s;e on a &s;ubject, which by others hath been &s;o much handled; for which there are many, many arguments, unan&s;werably demon&s;trative of this truth, both Phy&s;ical and Moral; yet having mentioned it, I cannot altogether pa&s;s the &s;ame without a touch at &s;ome few, that may be mo&s;t convincing and obvi|ous. (1.) If you &s;hould que&s;tion the being and &s;ub&s;i|&s;tence of the &s;oul after death, you mu&s;t al&s;o deny its <HI>frame;</HI> that it is a &s;imple, immaterial and active &s;ub|&s;tance, which hath neither quantity nor parts, and is not compounded of any principles, and therefore can be re&s;olved to none.&mdash;(2.) Do but con&s;ider, if the &s;oul have <HI>no cau&s;e of corruption,</HI> and from to contra|ries can &s;uffer oppo&s;ition, at the body do's, through the prevalency of heat or cold, how &s;hould it then admit of a di&s;&s;olution with the body! For you know generation and corruption they are by contraries. And
<PB N="262" REF="005185_0297_1016DC362E0E19A0">
if you argue from any natural cau&s;e, it mu&s;t &s;urely be one of two, which makes the &s;oul partake with the body in its decay and mouldering down; either a <HI>dependance on matter,</HI> as the &s;oul of the bea&s;t hath, which is but a material form, or a <HI>conflict from con|trary qualities,</HI> which you know helps the bodies wa&s;ting and its fall: but I think, you would not &s;o far contradict rea&s;on, as to alledge any of the&s;e concerning the &s;oul of man.&mdash;(3.) Con&s;ider, if by tho&s;e <HI>di&s;ea&s;es</HI> to which the body is &s;ubject, the &s;oul is not reached, mu&s;t it not al&s;o have a di&s;tinct exi&s;tence from it? And I am &s;ure, you mu&s;t grant, the &s;oul doth not directly &s;uffer from any outward di&s;ea&s;es; but the body may be under expre&s;&s;ible pain and angui&s;h, when there is a &s;weet calm and &s;erenity within.&mdash;(4.) Does not this witne&s;s, that the &s;oul lies not a dying with the body, nor falls with it, &s;ince it &s;uffers no <HI>decrea&s;e,</HI> but is found &s;trong and vigorous in its actings, when the fle&s;h is brought low, &amp; on a vi&s;ible decay? Yea, is it not at the greate&s;t advantage in its exerci&s;e and di&s;cerning, the more &s;eparate from the body, and &s;en|&s;ible things? Now it is &s;ure, that cannot be de&s;truc|tive to the &s;oul in its being, which is &s;o &s;ub&s;ervient to it in its operation. I think, tho&s;e who ever ob&s;er|ved the joy and peace of a dying Chri&s;tian, &amp; the ex|cellent frame and compo&s;ure of his &s;oul, under a pain|ed and langui&s;hing body, through many di&s;ea&s;es, may clearly &s;ee this truth, and there read a lecture of the immortality of the &s;oul.&mdash;(5.) Will you con&s;ider, can the &s;oul of man have a dependence on the body in its <HI>being,</HI> when it does no way depend thereon in its <HI>acting</HI> &amp; <HI>exerci&s;e?</HI> For it is &s;ure, it does truly act, yea hath a clear ratiocination, even when the body &s;leeps: and O does it not prove, that this &s;oul that is found waking, when the other is a&s;leep, mu&s;t have a di&s;tinct &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and live when that dies. (6.) If you admit that there are <HI>Spirits</HI> and <HI>incorporeal</HI> beings, which
<PB N="263" REF="005185_0298_1016DC81AA7B07D0">
do act without a body, and yet have a true and real &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, can you doubt or que&s;tion the exi&s;ting of the &s;oul, or its exerci&s;ing the faculties thereof, with|out the body, though you do not reach how this &s;hould be? And if there be indeed a conver&s;e &amp; in|tercour&s;e betwixt us and Spiritual beings, yea, a truth in fellow&s;hip with God the Father of Spirits, O may not this &s;atisfyingly demon&s;trate that exi&s;tence and acting of the &s;oul; even when the body is at a di|&s;tance and in the grave!&mdash;(7.) Con&s;ider, that which you mu&s;t grant hath a <HI>dominon</HI> and praeminence over the <HI>body;</HI> by its making a rational choice of good when it is mo&s;t cro&s;s to the de&s;ire and delight of the fle&s;h; yea can not only determine it to endure mo&s;t grievous torments, but does oft witne&s;s a &s;pecial de|lectation therein, mu&s;t it not be &s;omething truly di|&s;tinct from the body, and what can have a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence without it? Now this, I am &s;ure, you will not deny, that there is &s;uch a dominion over the fle&s;h, and a captiva|ting of it to the law of the mind; which the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ual and bruti&s;h will not deny in many in&s;tances, how little acquaintance &s;oever they have with it them&s;elves.&mdash;(8.) Since there is a di&s;covery and know|ledge of things, not only <HI>above</HI> the reach and impre&s;|&s;ions of <HI>&s;en&s;e,</HI> but even <HI>contrary</HI> thereto, that men do rationally judge and a&s;&s;ent to truths, which truly contradicts their &s;en&s;es, as the rotundity of the earth, which &s;ems to us a plain, &amp;c. O does it not &s;hew, that this &s;oul in man, which can &s;o far &s;oar above the earth, and does &s;o far exceed the body, mu&s;t be of a more excellent mould, and &s;omething truly diffe|rent from it? I &s;hall but add, what means that <HI>war</HI> and <HI>&s;trugling</HI> which to every Chri&s;tian is known be|twixt the <HI>fle&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Spirit;</HI> yea, to every man is known betwixt <HI>him</HI> and his natural <HI>con&s;cience?</HI> what mean tho&s;e <HI>reflex</HI> acts of the &s;oul on its &s;elf, tho&s;e marvellous products of the under&s;tanding, and

I re|member a pa&s;&s;age of worthy <HI>Mr. Blair,</HI> our own country man, who the fir&s;t time he heard <HI>Mr. Bruce</HI> preach, &s;aid, The &s;ame of &s;o great a man cau&s;ed him to expect &s;omething very extraordinary from him; but his whole Sermon did pre&s;s this truth of the &s;oul's being immortal, and that it was a great thing to be|lieve it; he confe&s;&s;ed, it did at fir&s;t &s;ome way amu&s;e him, why he dwelt &s;o much upon &s;o known and com|mon a &s;ubject: but after, he found it was &s;ome other thing than appears at the fir&s;t look; for which men may di&s;pute, and to&s;s it as a notion in the &s;chools, who never knew what it was to believe the truth thereof; and that a &s;erious impre&s;&s;ion of it on the heart is &s;omething el&s;e than a &s;wiming of it in the head, by &s;ome ordinary &s;peculation of this. O what a truth would it appear, and what a&s;to|ni&s;hment would it cau&s;e, if men would but &s;ome times go alone, and con&s;ider,&mdash;(1.)

<P>Now to &s;hut up this argument, I &s;hall offer one in&s;tance more, wherein the world may &s;ee the truth of the Scripture, and therewith of a divine provi|dence, convincingly demon&s;trated, if prejudice did not draw a vail and ob&s;truct &s;o excellent a di&s;covery: it is this, <HI>That the way of God is perfect</HI> (P&s;al. 18. 30.) <HI>and that his works are perfect; and his ways, judg|ment,</HI> (Deut. 32. 4.) yea, <HI>that he do's all things well</HI> (Mark. 7. 37.) which te&s;timony then the <HI>multitude</HI> was forced to bear to this great truth: And O how great a truth is it! which can be &s;aid neither of An|gels nor men, but to Him hath a peculiar re&s;pect, even to him alone, in who&s;e way there is nothing crooked, no mi&s;take, no inequality, nothing too much or &s;uperfluous, nothing out of due time, that is either too &s;oon, or too late, nothing incongruous,

nothing mi&s;placed; yea, in all he do's nothing which is not be&s;t done, which any could rectify or make better, but in every piece of his work leaves matter of wonder behind, and thus declares him&s;elf to be God!

<P>I &s;hall here offer to prove the Scriptures accom|pli&s;hment, is this, <HI>That whereof the mo&s;t part, as to tho&s;e &s;pecial predictions and promi&s;es that concern the Church, is fulfilled, and hath new taken place in their appointed times, which we may at this day clearly read in the event, and but a little part thereof now remain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">h to be made out, mu&s;t be a &s;ure truth.</HI> But the Scripture is thus fulfilled, and the prophecies thereof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> made legible in the hi&s;tory of providence, and in the works of God about his Church. Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I would premi&s;e here &s;ome few things, ere I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> particularly to this argument.</P>
<P N="1">1. Though the Scripture is thus wonderfully &s;uited by the Lord, and taketh place in <HI>every</HI> generation, as if it were alone directed to <HI>that</HI> time; yet it is al&s;o clear, that a <HI>&s;pecial part</HI> thereof hath its <HI>proper accom|pli&s;hment</HI> in tho&s;e ages and periods of time, to which it doth in a <HI>peculiar</HI> way relate: &s;ome part of it, which did concern the times of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> &s;ome that doth al&s;o an&s;wer to the times of the <HI>Go&s;|pel,</HI> and a part of it which hath a peculiar re&s;pect to the&s;e latter days, which the Lord is now bringing forth, and we wait for a more full accompli&s;hment, that it is on a near approach.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is al&s;o &s;ure, that the <HI>whole work</HI> of God, and <HI>his</HI> providence about his Church here in the World, which was perfect from the beginning, and before him from eternity, is comprehended under the writ|ten <HI>word;</HI> where the Lord hath fully revealed his mind and coun&s;el about every event and concern|ment of the Church; though we oft be in the dark, in finding out the &s;ame, but the event will in due time &s;peak for it &s;elf, which &s;hould cau&s;e us until then
<PB N="288" REF="005185_0323_1016DCC89AEBFF90">
with much &s;obriety to pa&s;s our judgment on &s;ome of tho&s;e truths, that are not yet fulfilled.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is clear, that the Prophets of old did not only foretel &s;uch great changes and revolutions, as were to go over the Church's head, and declare the certainty thereof, but we find the&s;e prophecies oft point at the <HI>times</HI> and <HI>periods of time,</HI> whereto they did relate; and though &s;ometimes in dark terms, yet did clearly &s;hew that there was a certain prefixed time, and not at every time could they have their perfor|mance.</P>
<P N="4">4. We &s;hould con&s;ider how the full <HI>accompli&s;hing</HI> of the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and the <HI>perfecting</HI> the Lord's <HI>work</HI> about his Church, will be at once, and doth keep pace together, and then &s;hall a <HI>full</HI> and <HI>&s;atisfying di&s;|covery</HI> of God's way and providence and all that he hath been doing in the World, clearly break forth, when the <HI>great my&s;tery of God</HI> in his written <HI>word</HI> is <HI>fini&s;hed,</HI> and the Church &s;o near to land.</P>
<P>That I may &s;peak a little to &s;o grave a &s;ubject, I would lay down the&s;e two things to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>How much</HI> of the Scripture, and predictions thereof, may be <HI>now</HI> &s;een clearly <HI>verified</HI> in the event.</P>
<P N="2">2. What doth yet <HI>remain</HI> to have an accompli&s;h|ment in the&s;e la&s;t times; by which we may certainly judge, how near the Lord's work about his Church is to a <HI>clo&s;e.</HI> Under the fir&s;t I &s;hall point at &s;ome of tho&s;e mo&s;t concerning events and changes, which the Church hath met with, wherein we may &s;ee what of the Scripture may at this day be read in the hi&s;tory of providence, and is certainly fulfilled.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> thing to be con&s;idered, is,&mdash;WHAT IS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED.</P>
<P>I. Let us go back to tho&s;e fir&s;t times after the fall; and &s;ee <HI>that dreadful &s;troke, which came upon the old
<PB N="289" REF="005185_0324_1016DCCD30FCE8A8">
World by the flood, after an univer&s;al defection from God,</HI> and we &s;hall there find the fulfilling of that which <HI>Noah,</HI> that great <HI>Preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> had oft fore|told, and of tho&s;e threatnings which by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> were there recorded: Wherein it may be very manife&s;t, (1.) That this truth, be&s;ides Divine authority, no <HI>re|cords of ancient Times</HI> (no antiquity) could ever <HI>con|tradict;</HI> yea, &s;ome of the elde&s;t writers do clearly <HI>witne&s;s</HI> &s;omething of an univer&s;al <HI>deluge</HI> over the earth, with the &s;trange <HI>pre&s;ervation</HI> of &s;ome from it, how|ever they were in the dark as to many circum&s;tances of it. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> doth cite <HI>Bero&s;us</HI> the Caldears about this, who without doubt had then &s;ome of tho&s;e olde&s;t records true and uncorrupt. <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> al&s;o doth mention &s;ome fragments of <HI>Abidenus,</HI> and <HI>App<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">idorus,</HI> which in his time were extant, clearly pointing at the flood, and at <HI>Noah</HI> under the name of <HI>Ziuthrus,</HI> with his &s;ending out of birds to &s;ee if the waters were a&s;&s;waged.&mdash;(2.) There is nothing here doth contradict <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> how this might be brought about, even in the way of ordinary natural cau&s;es, which the Lord did make u&s;e of for that end. For we find, <HI>the windows of Heaven were opened,</HI> the air being conden&s;ed into clouds, and their retentive power loo&s;ed, the&s;e great floodgates were thus &s;et open; which falling not in drops, but all in a full bo|dy, like the &s;pouts and cataracts of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> might &s;oon overwhelm, the earth with abundance of water; while tho&s;e <HI>fountains al&s;o of the great deep</HI> be|neath were broken up, which was not only the O|cean let forth to go over its banks, but an univer&s;al vent to all the veins of the earth, and that great ma&s;s of waters which is in the bowels thereof, which from beneath meeting tho&s;e that were from above, may give men a clear and rational account how &s;uch a thing might be.&mdash;(3.) This piece of the Scripture is mo&s;t <HI>congruous</HI> and agreable to the <HI>whole,</HI> and the
<PB N="290" REF="005185_0325_1016DCD15B2DE6A8">
great <HI>&s;cope</HI> and <HI>drift</HI> of the &s;ame. For it points out an <HI>univer&s;al defection,</HI> and an <HI>univer&s;al &s;troke</HI> meeting together: it leads us forward to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> of whom the <HI>ark</HI> was an excellent &s;hadow, and of that &s;alva|tion which in and by him the Church hath from eternal wrath: and is a very manife&s;t pledge and &s;ign of that <HI>la&s;t de&s;truction</HI> of the World, which though not in that manner, yet &s;hall once &s;urely be, and find men in &s;uch a condition, as this flood found them into in the days of <HI>Noah.</HI></P>
<P>(&para;) II. What we find expre&s;ly threatned by the Lord (<HI>Gen.</HI> 11. 7.) as a &s;troke and judgment upon men for their ambition and pride, <HI>The confounding of their languages,</HI> is it not al&s;o mo&s;t clearly verified and writ forth to the view of the world in the event? that whil&s;t men cannot deny or debate a thing which is &s;o con&s;picuous and undeniable, they mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ee a fulfilling of the Scripture, and that there was a di|vine hand in this &s;trange &s;troke; which may be a con|vincing refutation of Athei&s;m, if &s;uch do not wil|lingly &s;hut their eyes at the&s;e clear evidences.&mdash;(1.) That it is &s;ure, there is &s;uch a <HI>confu&s;ion</HI> and variety of <HI>languages</HI> in the earth <HI>at this day;</HI> whence it is <HI>divided,</HI> one part thereof &s;o much rent from another, commerce and corre&s;pondence thus made difficult, and a bar drawn betwixt nations, by a different &s;peech. And do not the mo&s;t ancient re|cords of the world witne&s;s the &s;ame to have been in <HI>former</HI> ages?&mdash;(2.) It is al&s;o &s;ure, that <HI>no tradition</HI> or humane hi&s;tory, but the Scripture only, gives us an <HI>account</HI> of this &s;trange thing how it &s;hould be, or whence its true ri&s;e is; yea, tho&s;e who have writ mo&s;t of other things, yet can give no rea&s;on why they write in one language more than in another, but that it is proper to their country, where they had their e|ducation. But how the race of men, who have &s;uch
<PB N="291" REF="005185_0326_1016DCD2F135ABE8">
a community in other things, &s;hould be thus divided, is indeed a my&s;tery, which divine truth can only unvail and &s;hew its meaning.&mdash;(3.) It is &s;ure, there is no lan|guage one more than another, that is <HI>natural</HI> to men, but what <HI>ex in&s;titutio</HI> is acquired, whether by long continued <HI>u&s;e</HI> as children doth their mother tongue, or by &s;et rules. It is true, <HI>Adam</HI> who was the fir&s;t man, had his by &s;ome extraordinary infu&s;ion: but it is found a pi|tiful fancy alledged by &s;ome, that young children, who have never heard &s;peech, and have been thus kept at a di&s;tance, would &s;peak the fir&s;t language of the world, and con&s;equently <HI>Hebrew;</HI> for the contrary of this is certainly prov'd.&mdash;(4.) Is not this <HI>confu&s;ion</HI> and diver&s;ity of languages, which is in the world, a <HI>mo&s;t &s;trange</HI> and <HI>marvellous</HI> thing, which in no ordi|nary way, yea not without &s;omething of a miracle, could be brought about, and to no continuance of time or invention of men can be attributed, if we con&s;ider the&s;e things.&mdash;(1.) It is clear, that if man can be traced back to &s;ome <HI>original</HI> and beginning, there mu&s;t then have been &s;ome <HI>one</HI> language, whil&s;t the world was but in a family; &s;o that if you will ad|mit the truth of the creation, you may &s;ee it was not &s;o at the beginning.&mdash;(2.) Is it not undeniable, that men could not <HI>chu&s;e</HI> &s;o great a plague and judgment on them&s;elves, if they had any u&s;e of rea&s;on? which would divide betwixt them and the greater part of mankind, hinder trade and mutual inter|change with other countrys, either in exporting or importing mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary commodities; that which al&s;o would ob&s;truct humane knowledge, and the di&s;covery of tho&s;e excellent inventions and experi|ments of other places; yea, give man, who&s;e days are &s;o few, &s;uch a &s;ore toyl and labour to acquire but a few of tho&s;e many different languages, which are in the world.&mdash;(3.) Is it not al&s;o clear, that this is above human reach, which men cannot judge, <HI>how</HI> in an

the re&s;t of the World, as a <HI>peculiar people to the Lord</HI> is a Thing undeniable.</P>

<P>Now as to this particular prophecy we would but &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider,&mdash;</P>

hath not this been witne&s;&s;ed to after-ages by a vi|&s;ible monument, even the de&s;truction of the <HI>Temple,</HI> that great and excellent work, which tho' after rebuilt did never attain its former &s;plendor.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P>VI. What was foretold by <HI>Daniel</HI> concerning <HI>the ri&s;e and fall of the Monarchies,</HI> and change of tho&s;e great Empires, which had been &s;o &s;ore a rod upon the Church, hath it not many ages pa&s;t had a mo&s;t punc|tual performance? It is now long &s;ince that great <HI>I|mage</HI> &s;hewed to the Prophet in a vi&s;ion, hath been
<PB N="298" REF="005185_0333_1016DCE92099D728">
brought down and broken, &s;o that &s;carce the <HI>toes</HI> thereof do now remain: which, be&s;ides the Scrip|ture, may be clearly demon&s;trated upon other rational grounds.</P>
<P N="1">1. It's being granted, that the Prophecy of <HI>Daniel</HI> was tran&s;lated in <HI>Greek,</HI> and laid up in that great li|brary of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> long before much of it was ful|filled, before <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes,</HI> and the ri&s;ing of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, of which <HI>Porphyrius</HI> could not be ignorant, though all he could an&s;wer to that evident agreement betwixt his Prophe&s;ie and the e|vent was, that it mu&s;t have been writ after the&s;e things were accompli&s;hed; while&s;t it is clear, that a part of the Prophecy of <HI>Daniel,</HI> which concern|ed the <HI>fourth</HI> Monarchy, was not even in his times fully made out, yea we mu&s;t &s;ay, &s;omething thereof doth reach to the la&s;t end of time.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. It mu&s;t al&s;o be granted, that &s;ome things which in <HI>Daniel's</HI> Prophe&s;ie would &s;eem mo&s;t &s;trange and improbable, &s;uch as <HI>Bel&s;hazar's</HI> death in that very night the hand writing was &s;hewed to him, may be particularly under&s;tood in <HI>Xenophon's</HI> hi&s;tory; how <HI>Cyrus</HI> took the advantage of the <HI>Babylonian</HI> &s;ecurity, while&s;t they were in the mid&s;t of a &s;olemn Fea&s;t, and by diverting the channel of <HI>Euphrates</HI> did enter the city without oppo&s;ition; al&s;o how that <HI>great horn of the high goat</HI> was &s;o &s;uddenly broken, and the com|ming up of <HI>four in his room,</HI> which by <HI>Daniel</HI> are
<PB N="299" REF="005185_0334_1016DCEAAEC92470">
expounded of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Monarchy, and the <HI>di|viding</HI> of that Empire after <HI>Alexander's</HI> death, is it not punctually held forth by all the hi&s;tories of that time?</P>
<P N="4">4. Was there not a very convincing appearance of a divine hand, both in the <HI>ri&s;e</HI> and <HI>fall</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Monarchies,</HI> and an extraordinary providence which we cannot but &s;ee, when we read the&s;e hi&s;tories, that &s;urely &s;omething above ordinary means and &s;econd cau&s;es was both in <HI>Cyrus'</HI>s conque&s;t over the <HI>Baby|lonians,</HI> and the marvellous &s;wift progre&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>Alexander</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>VII. That which was the great &s;cope of all Pro|phe&s;ies under the Old Te&s;tament, <HI>The coming of the Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> is &s;urely verified, and now many ages pa&s;t hath had an accompli&s;hment. <HI>The Lord is come unto his Temple,</HI> even he who&s;e day <HI>Abraham</HI> and the Saints under the law did long after: this was the mo&s;t happy and notable cri&s;is, that ever the Church was under, the great Epocha and period of time, from which &s;he doth now reckon. We know, this is <HI>no fable,</HI> or cunning device of man, <HI>that God was manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h,</HI> did make his abode for &s;ome time in the earth, <HI>&s;uffered</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in the view of the World, before many witne&s;&s;es, did <HI>ari&s;e</HI> from death on the <HI>third day,</HI> was &s;een and known by his Di&s;ciples thereafter, and having <HI>fini&s;hed the work</HI> for which he came, was <HI>received up again into glory.</HI></P>
<P>This is indeed a great truth, which concerneth us no le&s;s to know, and be &s;ure of, than our &s;oul is worth, and our intere&s;t through eternity: the fulfilling whereof, be&s;ides the authority of &s;acred writ, the witne&s;s and records of the Evangeli&s;ts and Apo&s;tles of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who te&s;tify what they certainly knew, is a truth which from &s;uch convincing rational
<PB N="300" REF="005185_0335_1016DCEDD808D118">
grounds may be demon&s;trated, that the greate&s;t height of Athei&s;m knoweth not how to &s;tate it &s;elf in a direct oppo&s;ition to the &s;ame. And truly in this, we may &s;ay, the Lord hath &s;o tendered the &s;trengthning of his people's faith and their encouragement, that as it is the mo&s;t concerning <HI>promi&s;e</HI> of the Scripture, on which our whole hope and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s depends, &s;o is it al&s;o mo&s;t clear and con&s;picuous in the <HI>event.</HI> I &s;hall but only touch this, whereof &s;o much hath been &s;aid by others.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is undeniable, the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias</HI> was <HI>to come:</HI> to whom all the <HI>&s;acrifices</HI> under the Law, tho&s;e ancient types and &s;hadows, did clearly point; to whom the <HI>Prophets</HI> bear witne&s;s; and it was the faith of the ancient <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church, of which promi&s;e they were <HI>per&s;waded,</HI> even whil&s;t they &s;aw it but a far off, yea, did <HI>embrace</HI> it and repo&s;e them&s;elves thereon. And is there not a mo&s;t clear and exact portraicture drawn forth under the Old Te&s;tament, of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias;</HI> what an one he &s;hould be, and by what peculiar charac|ters he &s;hould be known, who was to be revealed to I&s;rael?</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>&s;pecial &s;ea&s;on,</HI> and period of time, wherein Chri&s;t &s;hould come, we find prefixed and &s;hewed to the ancient Church: which, though under &s;ome figurative expre&s;&s;ions &s;eemed then dark, yet was &s;o far revealed, that upon diligent a &s;earch and en|quiry, and particular collation of the times, it might be ea&s;y to di&s;cern the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah'</HI>s coming and near approach. <HI>Of which &s;alvation the Prophets did enquire,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 10. And truly the fall of the Mo|narchies, and right under&s;tanding of <HI>Daniel'</HI>s weeks, were &s;ure and &s;olid grounds for a clear compu|tation. Thence was it, that &s;o general an ex|pectation of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias</HI> was among the <HI>Jews,</HI> at that very time when he came; &s;o as divers impo&s;tors did ari&s;e, who in the People were ready to follow; and
<PB N="301" REF="005185_0336_1016DCEFF43E6B90">
we &s;ee with what amazement the Phari&s;ees did in|quire at <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, <HI>if he were the Chri&s;t, or not;</HI> yea, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;heweth how the per&s;wa&s;ion of this did mo&s;t excite that People to war with the <HI>Romans</HI> from the prophecies they had in holy writ, that from <HI>Judea</HI> &s;hould about that time come he who was to be Emperor of the World.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is al&s;o &s;ure, <HI>there was &s;uch an one,</HI> who in the days of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and under the reign of <HI>Herod,</HI> was <HI>made manife&s;t to I&s;rael:</HI> and came with no out|ward &s;hew and ob&s;ervation, but did great and marvellous things before all the People; was cruci|fied at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> under <HI>Pontius Pilate;</HI> and not|with&s;tanding the ignominy of his death, was after ado|red, and followed, both by many of the Jews and the Gentiles; who&s;e doctrine did al&s;o in &s;hort time &s;pread through the World: a truth, which the greate&s;t adver&s;aries of the Go&s;pel have ever confe&s;&s;ed, and do atte&s;t the hi&s;tory thereof, <HI>de facto,</HI> to be a faithful re|lation. Not only Jews, but the heathen writers, <HI>Sue|tonius, Tacitus,</HI> and <HI>Plinius</HI> the younger, that lived near, and &s;ome of them contemporary with the Times of the Apo&s;tles, do witne&s;s that this JESUS, whom the Chri&s;tians wor&s;hip, did truly &s;uffer in the time of <HI>Pilate's</HI> juri&s;diction over the Jews.</P>
<P N="4">4. Is it not clear, how this appearance of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to the World did exactly fall in with the very time, <HI>foretold by the Prophets</HI> therefor? Was not <HI>Jacob</HI>'s prophecy thus accompli&s;hed? For until that time it is clear, the royal line of <HI>David</HI>'s hou&s;e did not cea&s;e, until <HI>Herod</HI> a &s;tranger came to reign, by whom it was utterly cut off. And it is manife&s;t, tho&s;e 70 <HI>weeks</HI> mentioned by <HI>Daniel,</HI> mu&s;t be under&s;tood of <HI>years;</HI> el&s;e they could admit no other &s;en&s;e: which reckoning from the decree given out by <HI>Cyrus,</HI> to rebuild the temple, are 490 Years, and doth an&s;wer
<PB N="302" REF="005185_0337_1016DCF56F03C828">
to the very time of Chri&s;t being in the World, and his death, which nece&s;&s;arily falls in the la&s;t of the&s;e weeks, a thing &s;o manife&s;t, that <HI>Porphyrius</HI> an avowed enemy to the Chri&s;tian Religion, could have no an&s;wer, but that this prophecy had been devi&s;ed after the event: which I am &s;ure; the Jews, though as direct adver&s;aries, would be loath to admit.</P>

<P N="7">7. There is an innumerable company, who have <HI>embraced the Go&s;pel,</HI> and <HI>received the &s;pirit</HI> by the mi|ni&s;try thereof, &s;ince the times of the Apo&s;tles, who
<PB N="304" REF="005185_0339_1016DCFA2BEAD7F8">
have put this &s;eal thereto in all ages, that it is <HI>the pow|er and wi&s;dom of God.</HI> And truly without par|tial re&s;pect (which the con&s;ciences of the wor&s;t of men have been forced to ju&s;tify) it may be &s;aid, the&s;e were <HI>the excellent of the earth</HI> in their time: many of greate&s;t outward parts and abilities, who&s;e mo|ral integrity and candour was beyond que&s;tion even with their adver&s;aries; and the&s;e both of Jews and Gentiles, of all ranks of men, of all nations and lan|guages; who not only by a naked profe&s;&s;ion, but by their walk and &s;ufferings did &s;hew forth the pow|er and vertue of a <HI>crucified Chri&s;t;</HI> yea, <HI>&s;hine as lights</HI> whil&s;t they were in the World, to the convic|tion of &s;pectators.

<P N="8">8. That excellent <HI>doctrine,</HI> delivered to the Church in the New Te&s;tament, by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, doth it not clearly &s;hew whence it is, and witne&s;s its own authority?

Te&s;tament. Now in this I would &s;eriou&s;ly atte&s;t the adver&s;aries of the Go&s;pel, if <HI>pagani&s;m,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> Alcoran, or <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Talmud hold forth any &s;uch doc|trine or rule as that which the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion doth! &s;uch pure, and excellent precepts, to re&s;train the inordinacy of corrupt affection, backed with argu|ments becoming an immortal &s;oul; a doctrine &s;o &s;in|cere, &s;olid, and rational, &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with it &s;elf, and agreable to the true &s;cope and drift thereof, which holds forth the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite rule of perfection, for men to pre&s;s after; yea, where every page and line breatheth forth holine&s;s towards God, and righteou&s;ne&s;s and humanity towards man!</P>
<P N="9">9. I &s;hall add, tho&s;e clear convincing <HI>evidences</HI> of the truth of the Go&s;pel, which did attend the <HI>fir&s;t publi&s;hing</HI> thereof were &s;o manife&s;t and undeniable a <HI>&s;eal</HI> from the Lord, as may force the greate&s;t Athei&s;t to &s;ilence.

It is clear, they walked by <HI>no</HI> rule of <HI>human</HI> policy, nor tho&s;e ordinary ways of <HI>in&s;inu|ation</HI> which the World doth u&s;e, to engage men, and make a party <HI>to them&s;elves:</HI> but did deliver the <HI>truth,</HI> truth mo&s;t repugnant to the fle&s;h and its intere&s;ts, with greate&s;t <HI>candour</HI> and <HI>&s;implicity,</HI> though likewi&s;e with a convincing <HI>authority</HI> and <HI>confidence;</HI> yea, came with a me&s;&s;age to the World, which had no other convoy, or per&s;wading argu|ment, but the evidence of its own truth, yet withal &s;uch a <HI>power</HI> accompanying the &s;ame, before which men could not &s;tand.&mdash;(3.) <HI>What is publi&s;hed concern|ing Chri&s;t</HI> by the Evangeli&s;ts, the great works he

did, his dying at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> with all the &s;tupendous circum&s;tances thereof and &s;igns from Heaven, was <HI>not a thing done in a corner,</HI> but in the publick view of men, which in tho&s;e days was mo&s;t known and famous: but yet there cannot be produced one <HI>con|tradictory</HI> te&s;timony, to the truth of the&s;e relations, by any adver&s;ary of the Go&s;pel, either at that time, or &s;ince. Sure the World wanted no malice, and the&s;e great things were early publi&s;hed by the Evange|li&s;ts and Apo&s;tles, while&s;t much of that generation was alive; yet it is clear, though in a matter of that concernment, which made then &s;o great a noi&s;e, and was at that time putting the earth all in a flame, none was found either among Jews or gentiles, who could or dur&s;t put forth a manife&s;to, to di&s;cover the lea&s;t cheat or fal&s;hood in tho&s;e things atte&s;ted in the Hi&s;tory of the Go&s;pel.&mdash;(4.) Whatever different <HI>parties</HI> and <HI>&s;ects</HI> did break out with the fir&s;t time of the Church, to <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> the truth in <HI>other</HI> things, yet in this they had <HI>all one con&s;ent,</HI> that <HI>he who was crucified at Jeru&s;alem,</HI> was the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Which truly did witne&s;s the clear irre&s;i&s;tible manife&s;tation of this truth in tho&s;e times; &s;ince, if there could have been the lea&s;t ground to challenge any impo&s;ture or deceit in this great foundation of the Chri&s;tian faith, it is more than probable, tho&s;e bitter contentions, followed with &s;uch animo&s;ity and heat and irritation, of tho&s;e whom the Apo&s;tles and Church in that time did with much zeal and &s;harpe&s;t cen|&s;ures pur&s;ue, would have engaged them to put all the di&s;grace upon the truth, which they could, if they might have had where to fa&s;ten their teeth. I would further add, that even the <HI>arguments</HI> and <HI>objections,</HI> which the adver&s;aries of the Go&s;pel could ever bring, to oppo&s;e the &s;ame, are indeed a convincing witne&s;s and confirmation, and &s;hew how <HI>little</HI> they could any way &s;ay, in giving their malice a vent. We find
<PB N="307" REF="005185_0342_1016DD0329F7AAE8">
that ab&s;urd allegation of the Jews, that the great <HI>works</HI> Chri&s;t did in the days of his fle&s;h, were <HI>by &s;tealing the name</HI> JEHOVAH <HI>out of the templ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> which they alledge he &s;ewed up in his thigh: which truly needeth no further refutation but the reciting thereof.

<P>VIII.

Now to clear this let us but con&s;ider,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>for many ages</HI> this truth about the incal|ling of the gentiles was <HI>&s;ealed up in a prophecy;</HI> a thing &s;o great and a&s;toni&s;hing to the ancient Jewi&s;h Church, that they could not well comprehend the &s;ame, until once the event brought it forth. For this was indeed <HI>a my&s;tery hid from ages,</HI> how <HI>the Gen|tiles &s;hould be fellow-heirs, of the &s;ame body, and Partakers of the promi&s;e in Chri&s;t;</HI> when the bounds and extent of the Church did not exceed <HI>Judea,</HI> that &s;mall inclo&s;ure, while&s;t the whole World be&s;ide did lie buried, like an outfield, in dark Pagani&s;m. For it is well known, that the mo&s;t plea&s;ant places of <HI>Africa, A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> where afterwards many famous

<P N="2">2. It is clear, that this prophecy was not held forth only in general; but we find the <HI>time</HI> al&s;o prefixed (with other &s;pecial circum&s;tances) when it &s;hould have its accompli&s;hment, <HI>at the appearing of the Me&s;&s;ias.</HI> He &s;hould be <HI>revealed to I&s;rael;</HI> before which time a bar was drawn in the way of <HI>the Nations,</HI> and a <HI>wall of partition</HI> betwixt them and the Church, <HI>until he &s;tand up</HI> who &s;hould hold forth <HI>an en&s;ign to the People,</HI> and <HI>gather the Gentiles under his &s;tandard;</HI> which <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> doth clearly &s;hew, <HI>I&s;.</HI> 11. 10. <HI>and</HI> 34. 1, 2. <HI>and</HI> 60. 1. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And then mu&s;t the <HI>mountains flow down at his pre&s;ence, Nations be born at once;</HI> yea, the <HI>light break forth to the Ea&s;t and the We&s;t;</HI> then &s;hould <HI>the Children of the de&s;o|late be more then of the married wife,</HI> when this time even the &s;et time for the gentiles is once come. And it may be very convincing, which is mo&s;t ob&s;ervable, that notwith&s;tanding of a more flouri&s;hing condition of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church in former ages, when her grandeur and pro&s;perity was more tempting, and the neighbourhood and commerce which the Na|tions about had with that People, yea, though by the captivity they were &s;cattered among the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Babylonians;</HI> yet was there no &s;uch &s;tir or change of the World, until the <HI>appointed time</HI> once came.</P>
<P N="3">3. It may be ea&s;y to prove the <HI>event</HI> of this pro|phecy, and its manife&s;t <HI>accompli&s;hment,</HI> even <HI>at the time</HI> thereof. For this men cannot deny,

I profe&s;s, when I read the Scripture, and there &s;ee &s;o expre&s;s and clear a forewarning, which many ages before we have about the <HI>coming</HI> of this adver&s;ary, with &s;uch pecu|liar di&s;tingui&s;hing circum&s;tances and marks, as are at this day mo&s;t exactly verified in the event, I am con|&s;train'd to admire at &s;o convincing and unan&s;we|rable a witne&s;s to the Scripture's divinity; and mu&s;t think it &s;trange, how men at &s;uch a rate can wre&s;tle again&s;t the truth, except by getting a victory over their con&s;cience, and putting the light in fetters, whil&s;t they own the&s;e Prophe&s;ies of the New Te&s;ta|ment to be of divine verity; which yet they &s;o evident|ly di&s;tort, again&s;t the clear &s;en&s;e and meaning thereof; yea, do adventure &s;uch a commentary on the &s;ame, that manife&s;tly de&s;troys the text.</P>
<P N="2">2.

I mu&s;t a&s;k, if this adver&s;ary &s;hould this day begin to appear, could you judge this is he, or reconcile &s;uch a contradiction, how he is <HI>now</HI> breaking out, who was <HI>beginning</HI> to di&s;cover him&s;elf 1500 years ago? For it is &s;o long &s;ince the Apo&s;tle &s;hew'd, <HI>this my&s;tery of iniquity was wor|king</HI> (2 <HI>The&s;s.</HI> 2. 7.) which clearly points at <HI>Anti|chri&s;t,</HI> who then was hatching, though not on &s;uch a growth and a&s;cendant, as after; and could he be yet latent, yet in the bud? Hath there been no further advance, after &s;o many ages? Hath this my&s;tery yet not wrought it &s;elf above ground? O where hath he been? that &s;uch a <HI>working</HI> thing, &s;o dreadful a &s;park could keep &s;o many ages under a&s;hes, and no flame, no fire perceived? For it is &s;ure if he was then <HI>at work,</HI> he hath not yet cea&s;ed. Yea, if you admit the Scripture, is not the ri&s;ing of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>

<P N="3">3. Is not this unan&s;werably manife&s;t, that <HI>he who did withold,</HI> and as a bar re&s;trained <HI>Antichri&s;ts coming for a time,</HI> cannot now be &s;tanding in the way? You &s;ee, the Scripture &s;hews expre&s;ly there is a bar mu&s;t be <HI>removed,</HI> and then &s;hould this <HI>man of &s;in</HI> be <HI>revealed</HI> and this cannot be doubted, but that &s;ome temporal power was hereby meant, which did then <HI>forcibly with&s;tand</HI> (as the original word KATEX<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">N imports.)

<P N="8">8.

It is true, this &s;eems very dark and my&s;terious, and in &s;tead of a more clear di&s;covery, might rather be judged a drawing a vail over this adver&s;ary: but &s;ince we have the Scriptures expre&s;s call and warrant, to make a &s;erious inquiry and &s;earch about its meaning, yea, does not only hold it forth as duty, but &s;hews &s;uch a thing is attainable, and may be under&s;tood, I &s;hall de&s;ire in humble &s;obriety, without peremptory a&s;&s;erting, to offer &s;ome few thoughts on this Scripture, both as to its meaning, and how clearly <HI>the man of &s;in</HI> is thus pointed out and his <HI>name</HI> made known by the <HI>number</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> about which I humbly judge (and mu&s;t therein crave liberty to differ from others, and tho&s;e who&s;e judg|ment I mo&s;t highly re&s;pect) that this <HI>number</HI> (as it is here &s;et down) is explicatory, and given as the very key to the Church, for opening the my&s;tery of this <HI>name,</HI> and of that <HI>man</HI> of whom al&s;o it is the number; and thus &s;hew's, it is not to be reckoned as the name of a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> per&s;on, nor is it to be found by Arithmetical computation in the numeral letters of a man, but is the name of a <HI>politick body,</HI> a name which comprehends a plurality, &s;uch as tho&s;e nu|merous orders and degrees of the <HI>pontifical</HI> Hie|rarchy are; and by &s;uch a &s;cale, his number does remarkably a&s;cend in &s;o many degrees, until it termi|nate in <HI>a man,</HI> even in one ab&s;olute Monarch and uni|ver&s;al Head, as the very <HI>Summa totalis,</HI> in whom that whole number re&s;olves, and therefore it is <HI>the num|ber of a man.</HI> Yea, by this reckoning, we may thus
<PB N="329" REF="005185_0364_1016DD793B61C458">
clearly know <HI>what</HI> a man that is; that as he cannot be known, if we take him alone, without re&s;pect to a politick body and the whole complex <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> of which <HI>number</HI> he is made up, as the con&s;tituent parts, we mu&s;t al&s;o under&s;tand, by this computa|tion, the <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> with re&s;pect to a long conti|nued <HI>&s;eries</HI> and <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> which here the Scrip|ture &s;hews to the Church: that he is not a &s;ingle in|dividual per&s;on only, or &s;uch a politick body, of many numerous degrees, re&s;olving in one head, which &s;hould be but for an age, or of a &s;hort duration; but that he is an adver&s;ary who is to be continued, in a <HI>nu|merous &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> through a &s;eries of many ages.

Now in this, I humbly judge, the &s;cope of the Scrip|ture is clear, in &s;etting down &s;uch a rule to count An|tichri&s;t by <HI>his number,</HI> and thus does prophetically ob|viate that great mi&s;take, after-ages would fall into, and is to this day entertained, that this adver&s;ary is but one individual per&s;on, who &s;hould get up, and cau&s;e a remarkable Apo&s;tacy in the Church; therefore it is, that the World will not know this is he, when they &s;ee him before their eyes; not con&s;idering that &s;uch a <HI>numerous</HI> body and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is contained in his <HI>name,</HI> from which he cannot be &s;eparate.</P>
<P>But for further clearing, I &s;hall offer &s;ome few things to be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered in his reckoning.

Here is a <HI>number</HI> which is not to be &s;ought after by the &s;ub|tile computations of <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> or any curious in|quiry in the numeral letters of a man's name; &s;ince thus we cannot know the true u&s;e of Chri&s;tian wi&s;dom
<PB N="330" REF="005185_0365_1016DD32D7058A18">
and prudence, which the Scripture requires; yea, it is clear, this way might an&s;wer &s;everal other names, as well as <HI>Lateinos,</HI> which could not in an ordinary way be determined, without a pretending to &s;ome extra|ordinary revelation and di&s;covery. But here may be judged work for &s;piritual <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> to count this <HI>number</HI> of Antichri&s;t, and his <HI>name,</HI> with re&s;pect to his nature, frame, and compo&s;ition.&mdash;(3.) Here is &s;uch a <HI>number,</HI> which is all &s;ummed up in <HI>one man,</HI> and cannot otherways be counted or under&s;tood, but as it hath a re&s;pect to a &s;ingle per&s;on, in a continued <HI>&s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,</HI> wherein it re&s;olves. Now, is there not &s;uch a <HI>number,</HI> to which the <HI>Pope</HI> &s;tands as nearly related, as the total &s;um is to tho&s;e degrees, and le&s;&s;er num|bers, of which it is made up?

We find here a <HI>large number,</HI> wherein there is a plurality of many dif|ferent degrees, ri&s;ing one above other, and is there|fore definitely expre&s;&s;ed by &s;o great a number as 666.&mdash;(5.) This is al&s;o a <HI>number</HI> (and herein there &s;eems clear ground for &s;uch a remark) which is mo&s;t <HI>unite</HI> and <HI>compact,</HI> with a clo&s;e concatenation, a re|markable <HI>order,</HI> and ri&s;ing from a lower to a higher degree, with a &s;pecial &s;ubordination and dependance on other; yea, is thus knit, that one part compre|hends the other; &s;uch as is mo&s;t clear and obvi|ous, in that &s;ubtile politick con&s;titution of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> State, and that numerous <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> with which this definite number of 666 &s;eems marvellou&s;ly to quadrate: where by a &s;cale of &s;o many &s;teps and degrees, you may follow up this number, as it were from &s;ix to &s;ixty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by Deans, Provincials, Ge|nerals of Orders, to Bi&s;hops, thence Archbi&s;hops, Primates, Patriarchs, Cardinals, until you find all re&s;olve in one man; who is as &s;traitly related to it, as

Whil&s;t the Scripture &s;hews, this is <HI>the number of a man,</HI> and <HI>of his name,</HI> does it not al&s;o &s;hew, it is &s;uch a number that lies neare&s;t <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> and is mo&s;t &s;traitly related to him; and as the formal cau&s;e, does mo&s;t &s;pecially concur in his con&s;titu|tion, yea, gives as it were life to that image? Now let it be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered <HI>what</HI> this is, yea, whither that my&s;tery of Antichri&s;tiani&s;m does not in a peculiar way lie in his <HI>Supremacy,</HI> and being <HI>infallible</HI> and the ultimate <HI>judge</HI> of controver&s;ies, which he claims as ab&s;olute <HI>Head</HI> of the Church univer&s;al, and that foun|tain whence all tho&s;e degrees of power in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Hierarchy do flow, and in whom they fully termi|nate. For it is clear, thence are all tho&s;e gro&s;s tenets, and corruptions in doctrine. Thus he mo&s;t directly <HI>exalts him&s;elf again&s;t</HI> God, and puts the Mediator off his throne: thus he does exerci&s;e authority over men's con&s;cience; thus Antichri&s;tiani&s;m, and that avowed oppo&s;ition to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, takes life, is nouri&s;hed, and hath its &s;trength, even under tho&s;e wings of his ab&s;o|lute &s;upremacy. Now if it be clear that this is the <HI>number</HI> which lies neare&s;t to <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> from which he can no ways be &s;eparated, and does mo&s;t formally make up that <HI>man of &s;in,</HI> then by the exerci&s;e of Chri&s;|tian <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> may that number, and its true meaning be thence under&s;tood.&mdash;(7.)

<P>XI. What was prophe&s;ied about <HI>the killing of the witne&s;&s;es under Antichri&s;t, (Rev.</HI> 11. 3, 7, 8.) we may &s;ay, hath clearly come to pa&s;s, and at this day may read the &s;ame in the event. For it is manife&s;t,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That during <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI>'s reign, even in the dar|ke&s;t times, there <HI>wanted not &s;ome to &s;eal the truth,</HI> and bear witne&s;s thereto, both by open confe&s;&s;ion, and &s;uffering on that account, which the Church-Hi|&s;tories can abundantly make out.</P>
<P N="2">2. That during that dark night tho&s;e who did give a te&s;timony, and any way appeared again&s;t the grievous encroachments of <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> in behalf of down-born truth, were put to <HI>prophecy in &s;ackcloth,</HI> when there was nothing left, but to weep over the Church's ruins, and witne&s;s their dete&s;tation and grief for the growing Apo&s;tacy of &s;uch times.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is clear, that as the <HI>prophecy</HI> doth point at &s;ome more <HI>remarkable &s;uffering</HI> and <HI>per&s;ecution,</HI> which the Church was to meet with from <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> be|yond all it had endured from that adver&s;ary in former ages; yea, a &s;pecial permi&s;&s;ion from the Lord to that party, to vent their rage and cruelty again&s;t the Saints, which &s;hould fall out after the witne&s;&s;es <HI>fini&s;h|ing

their te&s;timony,</HI> who had &s;o long in an abject low condition, as in &s;ackcloth, prophecied; yea, when Antichri&s;t &s;hould be at his height, and his Kingdom upon the turn, that then mu&s;t this remarkable <HI>killing of the witne&s;&s;es</HI> be accompli&s;hed: &s;o likewi&s;e did the <HI>event</HI> convincingly verify the &s;ame. For it is known that upon the clo&s;e of <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI>'s reign, whil&s;t the truth began to break out, this &s;ore&s;t &s;torm of per|&s;ecution beyond all that had been before, did then break upon the Church, even in its budding forth, that we may &s;ay, that adver&s;ary did not only put forth the utmo&s;t of his power and rage again&s;t the Saints, but &s;eemed in &s;ome mea&s;ure to bring his cruel de|&s;igns to pa&s;s; which the dreadful ma&s;&s;acres in <HI>France, Provence,</HI> and the Valleys of <HI>Piemont,</HI> the &s;ore and violent per&s;ecution of the Church thro' the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> under the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> and in <HI>England</HI> by Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> after the de|feat of the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> can clearly witne&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. Is it not al&s;o clear, how this remarkable <HI>&s;torm,</HI> and cutting down of the Saints, over who&s;e dead bo|dies their adver&s;aries did rejoice, was according to this prophecy to be <HI>previous</HI> to &s;ome eminent <HI>enlarg|ment</HI> and <HI>reviving</HI> of the Church, which did ac|cordingly fall out in the event, like a <HI>re&s;urrection of the witne&s;&s;es</HI> from the dead, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the World, that immediately followed upon the back thereof? &s;o that when their enemies thought they had gained their end, as they did conclude by &s;uch per&s;e|cutions, particularly that <HI>French ma&s;&s;acre,</HI> that the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> intere&s;t &s;hould be quite ruined, they were yet forced to &s;ee their labour in vain, and the Church more eminently flouri&s;hing after the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I &s;hall further add, that <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> hath not only been <HI>revealed,</HI> and his Kingdom come to its height: but it is clear this day, that it is on the <HI>falling</HI> hand, and

his <HI>ruin</HI> is now begun. Upon which account we may &s;ay, yea, have cau&s;e to &s;ing, that <HI>the winter is pa&s;t, the fig-tree putteth forth her leaves,</HI> that &s;heweth the &s;ummer's approach; yea, the <HI>&s;inging of birds is heard in our land:</HI> let us go forth, and meet him, who is now gone out as a mighty man, for the &s;alvation of his Church, and takes the fields again&s;t this great adver|&s;ary of his truth and people, on who&s;e &s;ide victory doth &s;urely wait.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> thing propo&s;ed, was to con&s;ider,&mdash;WHAT IS YET TO BE ACCOMPLISHED.</P>
<P>Having touched a little &s;ome of the mo&s;t concerning prophecies of the Scripture, both under the New and Old Te&s;tament, which are <HI>already</HI> fulfilled, and the truth thereof &s;o clearly written forth in the hi&s;tory of providence; that we may &s;ay, the mo&s;t ordinary ob&s;ervers, if they will not &s;hut their eyes, cannot want a conviction thereof: I &s;hall now in the next place point at that which yet <HI>remaineth</HI> of the prophetical part of the Scripture, to be accom|pli&s;hed; tho&s;e prophecies which concern the Church in the&s;e <HI>la&s;t times.</HI> Whereby we may have a &s;ure de|mon&s;tration, how <HI>far the night is &s;pent,</HI> and of the near <HI>approach</HI> of that ble&s;&s;ed <HI>day</HI> of the <HI>liberty of the &s;ons of God:</HI> for this doth <HI>fini&s;h the my&s;tery of God,</HI> and fully prefecteth his work, if once that which remaineth of the prophecies of the word were fulfilled.</P>
<P>There are tho&s;e truths, the accompli&s;hment where|of we have a &s;ure warrant to expect <HI>before the end.</HI> As (1.) The full ruin, and downfal of <HI>Babylon.</HI> (2.)

fall and de&s;truction of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire, that cruel party who have been rai&s;ed up and e&s;tabli&s;hed for judgment, with whom the Lord &s;hall yet rec|kon, for all that Chri&s;tian blood by them &s;o unju&s;tly &s;hed, as &s;eemeth clearly held forth, <HI>Rev.</HI> 16. 12.

We are al&s;o to expect, after all the&s;e, that full and la&s;t &s;troke upon <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog:</HI> and then <HI>the Lord is at hand,</HI> and that great <HI>my&s;tery</HI> of the prophecies and promi&s;es of the Scripture &s;hall then be <HI>fini&s;hed,</HI> and at a ble&s;&s;ed clo&s;e.</P>
<P>I. We have <HI>the full ruin and de&s;truction of An|tichri&s;t and his Kingdom,</HI> clearly prophe&s;ied, and in very expre&s;s terms promi&s;ed to the Church (2 <HI>The&s;s.</HI> 2. 2, 8. <HI>Rev.</HI> 16. 10, <HI>and</HI> 17.) the accompli&s;hment whereof we do yet according to the Scripture wait for; which the God of truth, who can|not lie or repent, &s;hall in due time a&s;&s;uredly bring about, and which approacheth when that &s;olemn cry &s;hall be heard, <HI>Babylon is fallen!</HI> about which we would con&s;ider,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That this judgment is <HI>already begun,</HI> and the fir&s;t &s;tep thereof vi&s;ible is now clear; wherein men may &s;ee the event mo&s;t exactly an&s;wer the prophecy. For the Lord hath begun to <HI>con&s;ume Antichri&s;t by the breath of his mouth:</HI> and &s;ince the fir&s;t breaking out of the light, his Kingdom hath been moulder|ing down before the Word. Have not Nations fal|len off, at the voice of the preached Go&s;pel? It is true, the Church wanteth not &s;ore conflicts, even under the <HI>Vials:</HI> and it is the Lord's way, to try his People with &s;uch various uncertainties, that when things have been mo&s;t promi&s;ing, another providence cometh like a cro&s;s wave, which &s;eemeth to drive them as far back, as once they &s;eemed to be forward. Yet it is &s;ure, and &s;hould be beyond debate, that Anti|chri&s;t's overthrow is upon a pre&s;ent <HI>advance,</HI> and that
<PB N="336" REF="005185_0371_1016DD38F6F580F8">
work of the Lord for his Church's deliverance is going forward. For if we believe &s;alvation by Chri&s;t upon the warrant of the word, &s;hould we not al&s;o with much a&s;&s;urance believe that Antichri&s;t's wound is deadly and incurable, which he hath got by the preaching of the Go&s;pel, which all the Phy&s;icians of the earth &s;hall never help.</P>
<P N="2">2. This is one of the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>&s;ignal</HI> acts of the judgment of God on his Church's enemies; one of the mo&s;t eminent manife&s;tations of his glory, which he hath re&s;erved for <HI>the la&s;t times,</HI> wherein the ap|pearance of his hand and great power &s;hall be very ma|nife&s;t; and we are to expect by this remarkable &s;troke that way &s;hall be made for that <HI>glorious hou&s;e,</HI> which Chri&s;t is to have for him&s;elf in the latter days, which &s;hall be built upon Antichri&s;t's ruins, when that <HI>new bride,</HI> both of Jews and Gentiles, &s;hall be prepared for the <HI>marriage-&s;upper of the Lamb.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Though we are to expect, on clear ground from the word, <HI>the Lord's eminent appearing by his im|mediate hand in this great work,</HI> which &s;hall be &s;o con|vincing in that day, and witne&s;s an extraordinary pro|vidence, that all lookers-on mu&s;t with fear and a&s;to|ni&s;hment confe&s;s, that this is God's own work: yet it is al&s;o clear, that <HI>he will therein make u&s;e of in&s;tru|ments,</HI> fitted and cho&s;en for that end, who &s;hall be rai&s;ed and acted forth with a more than ordinary Spi|rit, to <HI>execute the vengeance of the Lord, even the judgment written:</HI> among&s;t whom <HI>the feeble</HI> &s;hall then be <HI>&s;trong.</HI> Yea, we have ground to expect, that of the <HI>Kings</HI> of the earth, and the race and &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors of tho&s;e who in former times had <HI>given their power to the Bea&s;t,</HI> &s;hall the Lord rai&s;e up, to <HI>hate the whore, and make her de&s;olate.</HI> O ble&s;&s;ed are they, who &s;hall have a hand in &s;o noble a work, to &s;ack and de&s;troy that accur&s;ed City, built up with the blood of the Saints and martyrs of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="337" REF="005185_0372_1016DD86531F0CD0">
4. We are not to <HI>bound the Lord,</HI> as to any par|ticular <HI>time</HI> for accompli&s;hing this piece of his word: yet, we have clear ground to believe, that <HI>Babylon's ruin maketh ha&s;te,</HI> and <HI>the day of the Lord upon her is near;</HI> who&s;e <HI>&s;word is bathed in Heaven,</HI> and that the in&s;truments of his vengeance are making ready. One &s;troke upon that party is already pa&s;t; Antichri&s;t hath begun to fall before the word, and mu&s;t fall fur|ther until that great &s;troke, which &s;hall de&s;troy his &s;eat and lay wa&s;te that land, be accompli&s;hed. Some promi&s;ing evidences of its near approach I would here point at. (1.) The many <HI>prayers</HI> of the &s;aints, which are now before the throne, and cannot &s;ail of a return. Many who wre&s;tled oft with the Lord on this account, though they are gone, yet are their prayers on the file, and wait for this &s;olemn mani|fe&s;tation of the judgment of God: and the <HI>blood</HI> of the Saints doth not cea&s;e to <HI>cry,</HI> yea, hath as loud a cry as ever.&mdash;(2.) It is clear, that the <HI>preached Go&s;pel</HI> now &s;ince the light began to break forth, doth ripen and help to make the <HI>harve&s;t</HI> more <HI>white,</HI> than many ages formerly. And truly, if we con&s;ider how long the word hath been &s;ounding a retreat to that party, to come out of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and that for the&s;e 150 years they have been &s;till acting in oppo&s;ition to &s;o clear a light, to &s;uch a &s;olemn call, &s;o many warnings, yea, to &s;uch convincing di&s;covery of the Lord's being a|gain&s;t them in very remarkable providences, doth it not &s;hew, at what an height their &s;in this day is, and an ob&s;tinate rejecting of cure?&mdash;(3.) We cannot but &s;ee how that judgment which &s;hould be poured forth on Antichri&s;t under the <HI>vials,</HI> is in a great mea&s;ure now verified in the event.&mdash;(4.) It is clear, and con&s;onant to the Scripture, that the Lord's <HI>work</HI> is now <HI>ha&s;ten|ing</HI> in the latter days, providence in a &s;wift motion and making great advance, more quick changes in the ca&s;e of the Church, both as to &s;torms and calms,
<PB N="338" REF="005185_0373_1016DD3D27BBFB58">
and her trials now mu&s;t not be &s;o long as in former time. <HI>Rom</HI> 9. 28. <HI>He will out &s;hort his work in righteou&s;ne&s;s; for a &s;hort work will the Lord make in the earth.</HI>&mdash;(5.) That <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> and his followers do this day &s;eem to be at &s;uch an <HI>advantage;</HI> the Lord's work as it were at a &s;tand, yea, rather going back. This late reviving of Antichri&s;tian Prelacy in <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> with &s;o vi&s;ible a growth of Popery there, and &s;o dark an hour upon the reformed Churches a|broad, I think, on very &s;olid grounds, is a promi|&s;ing evidence of the near approach of a further &s;troke on that party. For it is clear, both from the word and God's ordinary way of procedure, how a &s;harp <HI>&s;torm</HI> is u&s;ually <HI>previous</HI> to &s;ome remarkable <HI>enlarge|ment</HI> of the Church; a very low ebb, before the tur|ning of the tide; yea, that every &s;tep of her advance, whereby &s;he hath gained ground on Antichri&s;t, hath &s;till had &s;ome conflict and wre&s;tling going before: and thus the Lord, by &s;uffering, doth ripen his People for &s;uch times of mercy. For which times, O let us pray and wait, when the &s;moke of that accur&s;ed City &s;hall a&s;cend up to Heaven, and his People be made to triumph in his prai&s;e, and &s;ing that &s;ong, <HI>Hallelujah! Salvation, glory, and honour to the Lord God, who hath judged the great whore! Rejoyce over her, thou Heaven, and ye holy Apo&s;tles and Prophets: for God hath avenged you upon her.</HI></P>
<P>II. We have a clear prophecy about <HI>the incalling of the Jews,</HI> and their conver&s;ion to Chri&s;t in the latter days, held forth by the prophets, and in the New Te&s;tament very expre&s;ly mentioned; the fulfilling whereof the Church mu&s;t yet wait for, and long after, when God &s;hall <HI>bring again the captivity</HI> of his an|cient People, and &s;ay to that <HI>valley of dry bones.

<P N="1"><PB N="339" REF="005185_0374_1016DD87DEDCC5A8">
1. That this promi&s;e doth not only concern par|ticular per&s;ons, or a few, but the <HI>body</HI> and <HI>genera|lity</HI> of that people, is mo&s;t clear from the Scripture, if men would compare <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 11. 11. <HI>Zach.</HI> 12. 10. with <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 25. Where it is undeniable, that their <HI>gathering</HI> mu&s;t be as full and remark|able, as their <HI>&s;cattering:</HI> and as there is no nation &s;o <HI>remote</HI> whither &s;ome of them are this day driven, <HI>that</HI> &s;hall not hinder the fulfilling of the promi&s;e; but as <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;heweth, <HI>the Lord &s;hall then a&s;&s;emble the di&s;per|&s;ed and outca&s;ts, and bring them back from the four corners of the earth,</HI> and furthe&s;t places thereof. Yea, doth not the Apo&s;tle expre&s;ly &s;hew, that it is <HI>all I&s;rael,</HI> whereat this promi&s;e pointeth? For <HI>though they are enemies concerning the Go&s;pel, yet are they beloved for the fathers &s;akes,</HI> becau&s;e of the Covenant which was made with <HI>Abraham</HI> and his &s;eed. And truly we have in this, ground al&s;o to expect &s;omething further than their conver&s;ion; that in this day the Lord &s;hall <HI>rai&s;e up the tabernacle of David which is fallen,</HI> and plant them upon their own land, <HI>Amos</HI> 9. 11, 15. Not only bring them to a vi&s;ible Church-&s;tate, but even therewith &s;ome temporal re&s;titution and recollection of them as a <HI>Nation:</HI> yea, we may expect a return of the old ble&s;|&s;ing of that land's <HI>fruitfulne&s;s,</HI> which I think is clearly held forth in that of <HI>Amos.</HI> 9 14. that the very <HI>hills &s;hall drop down &s;weet wine,</HI> and melt as it were in out|ward ble&s;&s;ings on them.</P>
<P N="2">2. That this promi&s;e hath <HI>not yet</HI> had an accom|pli&s;hment, is al&s;o clear from the Word. For it mu&s;t follow the rejection of that People, and &s;hould not take place until <HI>the fulne&s;s of the gentiles be brought in:</HI> which harve&s;t for many ages after was not to be reaped. Yea, did not the Apo&s;tle hold this forth as a <HI>my&s;tery,</HI> a piece of the Scripture which the ancient <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church could not well comprehend, when it
<PB N="340" REF="005185_0375_1016DD400B202118">
was pointed at Prophets, and even at that time was not under&s;tood? Which &s;urely could have been no <HI>my&s;tery,</HI> if their conver&s;ion had reached no further then the Apo&s;tles time; and it is known, how &s;mall a number &s;ince of that People hath yet been brought into Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. We have much ground from the Scripture, that this day, this great day of <HI>Jezreel,</HI> &s;hall be a very <HI>remarkable</HI> and <HI>&s;olemn</HI> time: which will cau&s;e a&s;to|ni&s;hment to the <HI>Nations</HI> round about, &amp; make a won|derful change on the face of the earth; a time of God's eminent appearance for that People, when his &s;ingu|lar re&s;pect &s;hall be as manife&s;t, as formerly his great di&s;plea&s;ure and anger was; a time, on which many of the choice&s;t mercies of the Church do certainly wait, the return of many prayers, a large <HI>pouring forth of the Spirit,</HI> even on the body of that People and on all ranks, not only the families of <HI>David Nathan,</HI> and <HI>Levi,</HI> but al&s;o the families of <HI>Shimei,</HI> with a large Di&s;pen&s;ation of gifts; yea, &s;uch a time, wherein the converted of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;hall then &s;ee and un|der&s;tand how far <HI>the glory of the &s;econd Temple</HI> doth <HI>exceed that of the fir&s;t,</HI> and &s;hall be a very con|&s;picuous part of Chri&s;t's univer&s;al Kingdom, eminent for the power and purity of the ordinances, to which others &s;hall look as to a mo&s;t choice and excellent pattern of a purely reformed and glorious Church.</P>
<P N="4">4. Be&s;ide the promi&s;e of him, who is not like man to lie, or the &s;on of man, to repent, there want not &s;ome very convincing <HI>providences,</HI> to confirm our faith concerning this: if we con&s;ider how this People are &s;till <HI>kept by them&s;elves,</HI> amid&s;t all their &s;catterings not mixt or incorporated with other Nations, which is mo&s;t u&s;ual thro' long conver&s;e, that people of &s;everal parts of the earth will unite &amp; join in one. Is not their great <HI>increa&s;e</HI> al&s;o remarkable? What great multitudes of them are in the ea&s;tern parts, yea, through mo&s;t of
<PB N="341" REF="005185_0376_1016DD898AF38338">
<HI>A&s;ia, Africa,</HI> and in tho&s;e places of <HI>Europe</HI> where the Chri&s;tian Church is? &amp; all this time their land not po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, but by a rabble of the <HI>Turks,</HI> under who&s;e yoke they groan. And though the <HI>genealogies</HI> of particular families are at this day much lo&s;t, yet there is &s;till &s;o much &s;ure and evident, as to the &s;eries and ge|nealogy of the Nation, that doth <HI>difference</HI> them from any other People.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is true, the authority of the word &s;hould &s;i|lence all our thoughts <HI>how</HI> &s;o great a thing &s;hall be brought about: yet we may judge, that (as a mean) <HI>this</HI> &s;hall eminently contribute to the &s;ame, &s;uch a convincing <HI>&s;troke upon Antichri&s;t</HI> which mu&s;t go before their conver&s;ion, wherein &s;o manife&s;t an ap|pearance of God, and the fulfilling of one of the great|e&s;t promi&s;es of the New Te&s;tament, cannot but &s;tare them in the face; and with this the taking away of that &s;tumbling block of <HI>idolatry,</HI> which hath &s;o long helpt to harden them again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;hut up this with a &s;ad regret that whil&s;t we have &s;o clear a promi&s;e, there is no more tender re&s;pect, and further e&s;&s;ay to promote the good of that People. Who knoweth, what a ble&s;&s;ing might attend the u&s;e of ordinary means? &s;ince this is an unque&s;ti|onable duty, and men know not, when they <HI>&s;ow the &s;eed, whether this or that &s;hall pro&s;per,</HI> alas! that the u&s;ual deportment of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> with whom they conver&s;e, doth oft further help to highten their pre|judice again&s;t Chri&s;tianity; let us long and pray more for this day, a day which &s;hall bring &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing with it to the <HI>gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>III. There are many prophecies both in the Old and New Te&s;tament, that do clearly point at <HI>a great flouri&s;hing &amp; pro&s;perity in the days of the Go&s;pel:</HI> which I humbly conceive, are not yet fully made out, but
<PB N="342" REF="005185_0377_1016DD42D0EBA658">
&s;hall have a more remarkable accompli&s;hment before the clo&s;e of time. <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 65. 25. <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 66. 12. <HI>Mich.</HI> 4. 1, 2.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, the event will be the &s;ure&s;t commentary; and until this appear, men &s;hould be &s;ober and cauti|ous, that they <HI>darken not the coun&s;el of God,</HI> and his truth, with any wild fancy, and aim to be <HI>wi&s;e above that which is written:</HI> yet I mu&s;t think, that there are <HI>great things laid up</HI> in the&s;e promi&s;es for the <HI>Church,</HI> that we cannot now well reach; yea, would &s;carce get believed, until the appointed time unvail their meaning. I &s;hall here but only touch how it may appear the&s;e promi&s;es are <HI>not yet</HI> fully accom|pli&s;hed, and <HI>what</HI> with a &s;afe warrant we may expect in their accompli&s;hment. As to the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> we would con&s;ider the&s;e things,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That the&s;e great promi&s;es, which hold forth &s;o eminent an enlargement and flouri&s;hing of the Church, do al&s;o point at &s;ome <HI>particular limited time;</HI> &s;ome period and revolution of the Church's condition, which is not agreeable and common to other times; until which the&s;e promi&s;es do not take place.</P>
<P N="2">2. This promi&s;ed flouri&s;hing concerneth both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and the word doth clearly point at &s;ome further encrea&s;e of the <HI>gentile</HI> Church by the calling of the <HI>Jews:</HI> which mu&s;t have a peculiar re|&s;pect to that &s;olemn time of <HI>I&s;rael's</HI> re&s;toration, and <HI>Antichri&s;t's</HI> ruin; a time, on which the return of ma|ny prayers, and the fulfilling of many promi&s;es in the behalf of the Church, do &s;urely wait. So that as <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> and other of the Prophets do put over this great flouri&s;hing of the Church to the days of the Go&s;pel, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. doth point at a more preci&s;e time, wherein this in a larger mea&s;ure &s;hall be made out.</P>
<P N="3">3. We cannot find the <HI>Chri&s;tian Church did ever</HI>
<PB N="343" REF="005185_0378_1016DD8C1397A7D0">
<HI>enjoy &s;o great an enlargement</HI> and flouri&s;hing &s;tate as the&s;e <HI>promi&s;es</HI> &s;eem to import. For per&s;ecution and &s;uffering hath mo&s;t been her lot, fir&s;t from the <HI>Jews,</HI> next from her <HI>heathen</HI> adver&s;aries, and la&s;t from <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> who&s;e fall and ruin, we have ground to expect, &s;hall make room for &s;o great an increa&s;e of the Church: for, how much power Antichri&s;t hath, in &s;o far is the Church kept under; yea, it is clear how very &s;hort all her breathings have been.</P>
<P N="4">4. It would appear, &s;o &s;olemn a time of the Chur|ches flouri&s;hing, whereat the <HI>Prophets</HI> did &s;o oft point, as it hath an undoubted re&s;pect to the days of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> &s;o in its full accompli&s;hment mu&s;t <HI>an|&s;wer</HI> to that remarkable day of <HI>Satan's binding</HI> and the <HI>Saints Reign with Chri&s;t,</HI> when <HI>the Kingdoms of the Earth become the Lord'</HI>s; which we find doth immediately preceed <HI>Satan</HI>'s la&s;t <HI>loo&s;ing,</HI> and his going forth to gather his broken forces, for that <HI>great battel,</HI> which is to be very near <HI>the end.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall but add, we have ground to judge, the Lord will u&s;her in that glorious everla&s;ting &s;tate of the Church, even by &s;ome <HI>preparative degrees</HI> here: the <HI>latter</HI> times are there to be reckoned the more ble&s;&s;ed, the more near they approach to the dawn|ing of glory.</P>
<P>Now, in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, I &s;hall but point at <HI>&s;ome things,</HI> which with a &s;afe warrant we may under&s;tand and look after <HI>in the accompli&s;hment of the&s;e promi&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>It is very clear, they hold forth a great enlargement to the <HI>univer&s;al</HI> Church, both of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Particular Churches may be in a &s;ad withering condi|tion, whil&s;t other parts do flouri&s;h: but the&s;e pro|mi&s;es &s;eem to point at a day, which will concern the &s;aints in all corners of the earth, who &s;hall not want their &s;hare with the re&s;t of that ble&s;&s;ed time. It may

be al&s;o clear, &s;ome more <HI>bright</HI> and <HI>hot &s;un-&s;hine of the Go&s;pel</HI> is held forth; &s;ome &s;uch remarkable <HI>&s;pring-tide of the Spirit,</HI> that &s;hall be as di&s;cernable, as the Churches low ebb &s;ometimes was; a day of the <HI>great power of God,</HI> his pre&s;ence very manife&s;t among his people and with the ordinances, beyond former times; &s;o that <HI>Ezek.</HI> 48. 35. <HI>The name of that place &s;hall be called</HI> Jehovah Shammah, <HI>the Lord is there.</HI> Yea, that in this day Chri&s;t's <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> Kingdom, in a <HI>&s;etled Church-&s;tate,</HI> &s;hall more emi|nently <HI>flouri&s;h:</HI> and the flowing in of people and na|tions with much fervour, who &s;hall <HI>joyn them&s;elves to the Lord,</HI> pure ordinances, a more univer&s;al onene&s;s among&s;t the wor&s;hippers of God, the walk of Chri&s;ti|ans with a di&s;cernable lu&s;tre of holine&s;s, will be made to commend the Go&s;pel; <HI>Chri&s;t's goings</HI> full of Maje&s;ty, and <HI>the &s;hout of a King</HI> which then &s;hall be heard among his People; the noi&s;e of &s;uch &s;ad complaints and bitter exerci&s;es from the &s;pirit of bondage, not &s;o much among the &s;aints, as in former times.

(&para;) IV. There is a &s;pecial prediction of <HI>Satan's binding up,</HI> or re&s;traint, and of &s;ome remarkable <HI>reign of the Church with Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> held forth, <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 2. The full accompli&s;hment of which we on clear ground may judge, is not already come: yet is &s;o far now verified in the event, as may clearly witne&s;s its meaning, and let us &s;ee how at this day it is taking place. I confe&s;s, this &s;eems one of the mo&s;t dark and ab&s;tru&s;e prophe&s;ies, we have in the Scripture; on which there hath been many &s;trange thoughts and glo&s;&s;es held forth: but to &s;et down the&s;e various judg|ments of men on the truths of God, I humbly think, may tend to a further darkning of the &s;ame, more than to any &s;olid edification. I &s;hall only offer &s;ome things to be con&s;idered, which by undeniable con|&s;equence from the Scripture &s;eem mo&s;t clear and ob|vious, and may only help to the under&s;tanding this Prophe&s;ie, but that manife&s;t corre&s;pondence which is betwixt it and the event at this day.</P>
<P>(1.) There can be no debate, this &s;olemn time of the <HI>Saints reign with Chri&s;t</HI> concerns the <HI>militant</HI> condi|tion of the Church, and mu&s;t be expected here on the <HI>earth,</HI> not in heaven. And therefore we find imme|diately after, there is a very &s;ore a&s;&s;ault of the <HI>Devil</HI> held forth, who &s;hould occa&s;ion a new trial to the Church; and he for a time let <HI>loo&s;e,</HI> to <HI>deceive the na|tions.</HI>&mdash;(2.) Since the Scripture is the be&s;t interpreter of it &s;elf, we mu&s;t here under&s;tand (comparing one place with another) this rai&s;ing of the Saints and Mar|tyrs of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to reign with him, <HI>figuratively,</HI> and in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as that is <HI>Rev.</HI> 11. 11. mu&s;t be under&s;tood; to wit, a ri&s;ing of the witne&s;&s;es in the <HI>&s;ame &s;pirit and power,</HI> and of &s;uch a party who &s;hould bear the <HI>&s;ame te&s;timony.</HI> To which al&s;o that in <HI>Mal.</HI> 4. 5. and <HI>Mat.</HI> 11. 14. about <HI>John's</HI> coming in the &s;ame Spirit of <HI>Elijah,</HI> with which he did appear to the World, gives light. So that we &s;ee how con&s;onant and
<PB N="346" REF="005185_0381_1016DD4A1ABD94C0">
agreeable the Scripture is with it &s;elf. (3.) Is not the meaning of the Spirit in this prophe&s;y clear, that the <HI>greate&s;t enlargement</HI> of the Church, yea, &amp; of the long|e&s;t duration and continuance, that it &s;hould have un|der the New Te&s;tament unto the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t, is held forth in the <HI>reign of the &s;aints?</HI> So that it manife&s;tly points at a more &s;olemn time, a more &s;weet refre&s;hing interval, which &s;hall be remarkable both in mea&s;ure and duration beyond all &s;he formerly had: and &s;hews, that there is no &s;uch happy time el&s;e to go over the Church's head, till &s;he be <HI>trium|phant</HI> in heaven. Therefore it is called, by way of eminence, the Church's reign, con&s;idered <HI>compara|tively</HI> with any other &s;uch change. (4.) Is it not very clear, that this &s;o remarkable time cannot be judged <HI>previous</HI> to <HI>Antichri&s;t's</HI> coming, nor <HI>under</HI> his ad|vance and growth? Since, fir&s;t, this points expre&s;ly at tho&s;e who were <HI>beheaded for the witne&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> and had <HI>not wor&s;hiped the bea&s;t and his i|mage,</HI> nor <HI>received his mark,</HI> who &s;hould thus be rai&s;ed to reign with Chri&s;t.&mdash;(2.) We find that it doth very immediately preceed that <HI>la&s;t a&s;&s;ault</HI> the Church &s;hall have, upon <HI>Satan's loo&s;ing,</HI> to gather the nations to that <HI>great battel,</HI> and &s;o mu&s;t concern the&s;e <HI>la&s;t times,</HI> when the Lord is pouring out his <HI>vials</HI> upon the throne and Kingdom of the <HI>bea&s;t.</HI> It is &s;trange, when the Scripture is &s;o plain, that &s;ome choice and excellent men, writing on this pro|phe&s;y, will have it contemporary with the Church's condition <HI>before</HI> Antichri&s;t's appearance: for it is &s;ure if by <HI>the bea&s;t and his image and mark,</HI> Antichri&s;t mu&s;t be under&s;tood, and if there be but <HI>one</HI> great a&s;&s;ault mentioned <HI>after</HI> this, which the Church militant &s;hall have before the clo&s;e of time, this prophe&s;ie mu&s;t <HI>now</HI> be fulfilling, and with no other time before this could quadrate, according to the Scripture.&mdash;(5.) Is it not clear, that this great re&s;traint of <HI>Satan</HI> is no &s;uch
<PB N="347" REF="005185_0382_1016DD924CE87950">
<HI>ab&s;olute</HI> binding, that will put the Church wholly beyond trouble and reach of his a&s;&s;aults? No, this be|longs to <HI>heaven,</HI> and is there only to be expec|ted. But the Scripture very evidently &s;hew's, this &s;hall be &s;uch a <HI>binding up of Satan,</HI> that he &s;hould <HI>not deceive the nations,</HI> nor have that wonted power to darken the face of the Church by any great or uni|ver&s;al apo&s;tacy, during this time. And I am &s;ure, it is undeniable, that &s;ince the Church's rai&s;ing from un|der Antichri&s;t, Satan hath been thus re&s;trained: &amp; by all his violent a&s;&s;aults, he hath not reached the <HI>full</HI> with|drawing of any one <HI>nation,</HI> which was brought under the yoke of the Go&s;pel; whatever may be &s;aid of poor <HI>Bohemia,</HI> by a violent cour&s;e of per&s;ecution &s;o born down, that this once famous Church is now &s;catter|ed in other places where there are yet con&s;iderable numbers, yea, it is not altogether without hope, that the great avenger of blood will yet vi&s;it her cruel u&s;age on that bloody <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> family, and return yet her captivity again, when it &s;eems now furthe&s;t off and hopele&s;s.&mdash;(6.) Mu&s;t we not &s;ee, that this great &s;un&s;hine, as it takes in <HI>Antichri&s;t's</HI> fall, hath a &s;pecial re&s;pect al&s;o to <HI>I&s;rael's</HI> return and conver&s;ion? Which, according to the Scripture, is one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn and flouri&s;h|ing times that the Chri&s;tian Church &s;hall have, and therefore &s;hall be to the <HI>gentiles</HI> as <HI>life from the dead.</HI> Now, do but &s;eriou&s;ly judge what the Church's con|dition <HI>hath been</HI> through all the times of the New Te&s;tament, fir&s;t under <HI>Heathens,</HI> and after under the tyranny of <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> and now how far providence does unfold the meaning of this prophecy in the event, &s;ince the <HI>man of &s;in</HI> began to decline; and I humbly judge, it may be ea&s;y to &s;ee, that at <HI>this day</HI> it is clearly <HI>taking place,</HI> though this &s;olemn <HI>reign</HI> be not yet advanced to its greate&s;t pitch, but will have a more remarkable period ere this prophecy be fully made out.

in the prophecy, mu&s;t be in a <HI>&s;piritual</HI> &s;en&s;e un|der&s;tood, and can be no bodily rai&s;ing of the Saints; &s;ince it is &s;o expre&s;ly there called <HI>the fir&s;t re&s;urrection,</HI> to difference it from the &s;econd, and is held forth in an oppo&s;ition to the fir&s;t death.

<P>VI. We have a prophecy held forth, <HI>Rev.</HI> 16. 12. which compared with <HI>Rev.</HI> 9. 13. &s;eemeth clearly to point at <HI>the fall and de&s;truction of the</HI> Tur|ki&s;h <HI>Empire,</HI> who have been the&s;e many ages &s;o great a &s;courge to the Chri&s;tian World.

It is true, the e|vent will more clearly make this known: Yet the&s;e Things are undeniable,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>&s;uch a Party</HI> was foretold by <HI>John,</HI> in that 9th Ch. and a &s;olemn warning given to the Church, of &s;o dreadful a &s;torm; the <HI>time</HI> al&s;o there pointed forth, when <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> &s;hould be at a great height; yea, the <HI>portr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">icture</HI> of &s;uch an adver&s;ary mo&s;t evidently held forth, &s;uch as indeed they were found to be, a <HI>terrible cruel de&s;troying</HI> party, and therefore are &s;aid to have <HI>brea&s;t-plates of fire;</HI> their <HI>number</HI> al&s;o there held out to be a <HI>very great multitude,</HI> which tho&s;e huge armies u&s;ually brought by the <HI>Turk</HI> to the field, can witne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>cau&s;e</HI> why the Lord &s;hould rai&s;e up &s;o dread|ful an enemy, and thus let them loo&s;e, is al&s;o expre&s;ly declared in that 9th Chap. 20th ver. that it was in judgment, and for a plague on men, for <HI>Antichri&s;tian idolatry,</HI> which then had &s;o much over&s;pread the earth; and it was no wonder, when &s;o much of the vi&s;ible Church was turned almo&s;t bruti&s;h in their Religion, and from the pure wor&s;hip of God was carried after idols of gold and &s;ilver, the work of
<PB N="349" REF="005185_0384_1016DD954EF210A8">
men's hands, that &s;o bruti&s;h and barbarous an ad|ver&s;ary &s;hould be let out for a &s;courge. I truly think, that as <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> and the abominations of that par|ty, hath been hitherto the let of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the <HI>Turk;</HI> &s;o we are not to expect the pro&s;pering of any &s;uch de&s;ign, and his fall and ruin, until the cau&s;e be removed, for which the Lord did make u&s;e of this dreadful rod.</P>
<P N="3">3. That &s;uch a party was rai&s;ed up, according to the <HI>prophecy,</HI> yea, at the appointed time thereof, is very clear, who like a <HI>mighty deluge</HI> did overthrow a great part of the earth, and with &s;trange prodigi|ous &s;ucce&s;s did over-run much of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> &s;ome parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> and brake in on <HI>Europe,</HI> to give work to tho&s;e <HI>kings</HI> and <HI>great men,</HI> and be a &s;courge to them, who had <HI>given their power</HI> to uphold the throne of the <HI>Bea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. There is al&s;o clear ground from the Scripture, that the <HI>Lord</HI> &s;hall as eminently appear in the <HI>fall</HI> and <HI>de&s;truction</HI> of this adver&s;ary, as in the rai&s;ing of them up; and that by <HI>their fall,</HI> he is to make way for the accompli&s;hing of his promi&s;e, about the <HI>Church's</HI> further <HI>increa&s;e,</HI> his ancient people, where|to this prophecy &s;eems to have a particular re&s;pect. This we are to look for, as one of the great works of the Lord, that is re&s;erved for the <HI>latter days,</HI> which &s;hall no le&s;s &s;hew forth his power and glory, <HI>even the drying up of that great Euphrates,</HI> than in the day that he divided the &s;ea, and made <HI>Jordan</HI> a dry channel for his people to go through. We are not to be further po&s;itive about means and in&s;truments, how &s;uch a thing &s;hall be brought about: it is enough, what the Lord hath &s;poken; and the word that is gone out of his mouth, &s;hall <HI>not return empty.</HI></P>
<P>VII. Now to clo&s;e this, there is yet one <HI>great a&s;&s;ault,</HI> which we find the Church &s;hall have <HI>before
<PB N="350" REF="005185_0385_1016DD4EF886EE98">
the end,</HI> and then <HI>her warfare</HI> will be near <HI>fini&s;hed:</HI> about which the Scripture is clear, that <HI>Satan</HI> for a little time mu&s;t be <HI>let loo&s;e,</HI> and that &s;olemn and perfect <HI>victory,</HI> which the <HI>Church</HI> in the clo&s;e of time will get over all her adver&s;aries, &s;hall be u&s;hered in with a very &s;harp trial, &amp; once again this <HI>ungodly World</HI> will &s;hew its <HI>rage,</HI> rally its broken &s;cattered forces, in a general mu&s;ter (<HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 8.) with as much fury as ever: and then &s;hall the <HI>Lord</HI> eminently appear, that by one full &s;troke he may for ever decide that long continued war and feud betwixt the Church and her enemies.

<P>But for clearing of this truth, there are two things we &s;hould gravely con&s;ider. (1.) Something which mu&s;t be <HI>previou&s;ly</HI> known and believed, that tho&s;e vi&s;ible <HI>heavens</HI> and <HI>earth</HI> are the very work and pro|duct of <HI>this God,</HI> who&s;e word and promi&s;e we have in the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and have their being and origi|nal from him: for otherwi&s;e there could be no rea|&s;oning from the&s;e, about the truth of his word. (2.) We &s;hould al&s;o con&s;ider, what a convincing <HI>pledge</HI> is here, for confirming our faith of the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and of the &s;ure performance of all that is yet remaining thereof to be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> it might &s;eem unnece&s;&s;ary &s;o much as once to mention it, &s;ince it is &s;o little que&s;tioned, or under debate; but oh<HI>!</HI> it is too clear, that many truths are ea&s;ily admitted, which are not really be|lieved. I know the world would find it hard to &s;hift &s;o manife&s;t a demon&s;tration, that this <HI>univer&s;e</HI> is the work and product of the <HI>great God,</HI> when there is in it &s;o bright a di&s;covery of infinite <HI>power</HI> and <HI>wi&s;|dom.</HI> Truly it is &s;trange, how men could admit its being, who have denied its beginning, which not only <HI>by Faith we under&s;tand,</HI> but is mo&s;t evident from &s;olid grounds of <HI>rea&s;on:</HI> And though men are un|done with implicit faith and a common a&s;&s;ent to the greate&s;t fundamental truths, without any &s;olid per&s;wa&s;ion thereof, yet the greate&s;t Athei&s;ts cannot keep off the di&s;covery of this, but by keeping at a di&s;tance from it. Which truly <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and others of tho&s;e ancients did not &s;o much deny the &s;ame, but <HI>not knowing the Scripture</HI> they could not know how it &s;hould be.

of nature, and &s;hun unan&s;werable ab&s;urdities, if they admitted an <HI>eternity</HI> of the world, did fall on &s;uch an irrational fancy, to avoid this, of the <HI>for|tuitous concour&s;e of atoms;</HI> yea, &s;ome held an eter|nal praeexi&s;tence of the <HI>fir&s;t matter:</HI> which pitiful no|tions may &s;hew what &s;ad ca&s;e men are in, who grope after the truth by the twilight of nature, and are &s;tran|gers to the Scripture. But I leave this, and &s;hall only touch a little &s;ome mo&s;t clear and &s;atisfying evidences of this truth, that the beginning and original of the world is not more clear from the Scripture, then it is al&s;o demon&s;trable from &s;olid convincing grounds of rea&s;on. And truly a clear, di&s;covery of this hath a further reach, than may be apprehended, to give the Athei&s;m of men a deadly &s;troke, and &s;hake all its grounds. Now let the&s;e few things be &s;eriou&s;ly con|&s;idered, (1.) If you confe&s;s there <HI>is</HI> a Deity, that <HI>God ble&s;&s;ed for ever</HI> is, mu&s;t you not nece&s;&s;arily admit a <HI>creation</HI> and <HI>beginning?</HI> &s;ince eternity is a thing, that is only communicable to the fir&s;t cau&s;e: and you can|not conceive that the earth could produce it &s;elf; for to exi&s;t, &amp; not to exi&s;t at the &s;ame time, is a contradic|tion. And I am &s;ure, they mu&s;t &s;hut their eyes, who do not every where di&s;cern &s;ome witne&s;s of the glo|rious being of God. (2.) You cannot deny, that there is &s;uch a thing as <HI>time;</HI> &s;ince there is no judging days &amp; years &amp; ages to be infinite, or how one thing in a continued order &s;hould go before another, without coming to &s;ome fir&s;t &amp; beginning.&mdash;(3) Does not this gradual advance of human <HI>knowledge</HI> in the earth and that further di&s;covery which <HI>arts</HI> and <HI>&s;ciences</HI> have made, by a continued improvement of the &s;ame, wit|ne&s;s very clearly a beginning and original of the world?

Since it is &s;ure and undeniable, that this <HI>earth doth hang in the empty place,</HI> though men &s;ee not whereon it leans and re&s;ts, O what a &s;trange thing is it!

<P>III. Ground, whence the godly in the&s;e times &s;hould be confirmed about the full performance of that which is yet remaining of the Scripture, that it is &s;ure, yea, now nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> at hand, is this, That <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come to action again&s;t the Enemies of his Church and hath taken the fields; that &s;urely he is now gone forth in the greatne&s;s of his &s;trength, conquering, and to conquer.</HI></P>
<P>This is a grave truth, which might give us very &s;weet refre&s;hing thoughts in &s;o &s;haking a time, that whil&s;t we have &s;een the Lord's appearing by a great and out&s;tretched hand for his people, have &s;een tho&s;e terrible &s;tirs and concu&s;&s;ions of the nations, have &s;een him <HI>&s;trike through Kings in the day of his wrath,</HI> and <HI>fill the places with the dead bodies</HI> of his adver&s;aries, we may al&s;o on clear Scripture-grounds conclude, that the Lord is now <HI>awaked as a mighty man,</HI> and upon the fields; yea, that the war is &s;urely begun again&s;t <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> and all the adver&s;aries of his Church, which &s;hall not cea&s;e until the full vic|tory be obtained. For indeed tho&s;e providences which in the&s;e la&s;t times &s;hould be very affrightning and terrible, when we go into the <HI>word,</HI> we &s;hall find they have a <HI>comfortable</HI> a&s;pect on the <HI>Church,</HI> and do pre&s;age her greater enlargement; as the ten|der buds and leaves of the fig-tree are put forth to &s;hew the &s;ummer's approach. <HI>Luke</HI> 21. 28. It is true, the Church is now low, and the work of God meets with very &s;ad interruptions, which are needful, both for trial, and rebuke: But this al&s;o is &s;ure, which none can deny, that the Lord hath emi|nently appeared, and <HI>done great things</HI> for his Church;
<PB N="362" REF="005185_0397_1016DD617087C078">
yea, we mu&s;t &s;ay, he hath by a confluence of very remarkable providences thus conde&s;cended to &s;trengthen his people's hands, to confirm &s;uch who are ready to &s;tagger, even as it were by crutches, about the greatne&s;s of the&s;e things which are yet pro|mi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Now to clear this truth a little, we would con|&s;ider, (1.) How it is very con&s;onant to the Scrip|ture, and expre&s;ly held forth in the &s;ame, that in the <HI>la&s;t times,</HI> and turn of the Church's ca&s;e from <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Lord will thus appear,</HI> in his great &s;trength, and <HI>&s;et up his &s;tandard</HI> again&s;t his adver&s;a|ries, yea, will then in a &s;pecial way call forth his people, to glorify him by an active te&s;timony. (2) That <HI>the Lord hath thus begun to appear,</HI> according to his word, is a truth that is al&s;o undeniable; and &s;hould much help to confirm our faith, about the performance of that which further remains of the Scripture.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>That the Lord will thus appear in the la&s;t times,</HI> this is manife&s;t from the word. To clear which ob&s;erve, 1. Though the Church militant mu&s;t not want an adver&s;ary, and &s;ome per&s;ecution from the World, even in her be&s;t e&s;tate: Yet we have a &s;afe warrant to expect that the Lord will <HI>glorify him|&s;elf</HI> in a peculiar way in his people now in the&s;e <HI>latter days,</HI> by their <HI>doing</HI> and <HI>acting</HI> for the truth, as in for|mer ages his glory did mo&s;t appear, during <HI>Anti|chri&s;t's</HI> Reign, in his Church's <HI>&s;uffering;</HI> for then <HI>the faith and patience of his Saints</HI> was to be witne&s;|&s;ed in its &s;ea&s;on, <HI>Rev.</HI> 13. 10. And thus he would &s;erve him&s;elf of his people, and bring forth his glo|ry, until that time of retribution, when <HI>tho&s;e who had killed with the &s;word, &s;hould be killed by the &s;word,</HI> and tho&s;e who <HI>led unto captivity,</HI> be <HI>&s;o</HI> dealt with: which doth al&s;o clearly promi&s;e &s;ome &s;pecial <HI>out pouring of the Spirit,</HI> for acting with the&s;e gifts of courage and re&s;olution, &s;utable to the &s;ervice of the
<PB N="363" REF="005185_0398_1016DDA870C4D530">
Church in the latter days. And truly I think it is a great defect, we &s;tudy not more the accompli&s;hing of the promi&s;es, and how to improve the &s;ame, for gifts, as well as grace, in order to the &s;everal times and ne|ce&s;&s;ities of the Church.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is very clear from the Scripture, that in the <HI>la&s;t days,</HI> when Chri&s;t is to <HI>rai&s;e</HI> his Church from under the power and tyranny of <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> he &s;hall then appear in a <HI>warlike po&s;ture.</HI> Which <HI>John</HI> had &s;hewed to him, <HI>Rev.</HI> 19. 13, 14. as one at the head of his forces, <HI>with his ve&s;ture dipped in blood,</HI> to &s;hew when once the war is begun again&s;t his adver&s;ary, and this <HI>Lion of the tribe of Judah</HI> begins to rouze him&s;elf up, what a terrible appearance he will have in that undertaking. And it is clear, that the Lord hath declared in this his coun&s;el and will, that his Son <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould in the latter times <HI>take unto him&s;elf his great power, and reign</HI> (Rev. 11. 17.) yea, cau&s;e the World to know him to be <HI>Head of principalities and powers,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Church.</HI> For his glory in this truth as a <HI>King,</HI> which former ages &s;eemed in &s;o great a mea&s;ure to darken, mu&s;t then clearly &s;hine forth. I truly think, men's appearing with &s;uch violence and rage again&s;t &s;o concerning a truth now in the&s;e days, doth pro|mi&s;e &s;ome eminent appearance of the Lord therein, and that he &s;hall yet more &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ert the &s;ame before the World.</P>
<P N="3">3. Doth not the Scripture point at the <HI>la&s;t times,</HI> as that &s;pecial time of <HI>recompence for the contro|ver&s;y of Sion?</HI> to which the Lord hath re&s;erved a &s;o|emn triumph of his ju&s;tice, over all his Church's enemies; when he &s;hall <HI>inquire for the blood of his Saints,</HI> &s;hed upon the earth &s;ince the days of <HI>Abel,</HI> at <HI>Babylon's</HI> hand (<HI>Rev.</HI> 18. 24.) that great adver&s;ary, who &s;tands in law guilty, and hath &s;erved her&s;elf <HI>heir</HI> to all the violence and cruelty done in

former ages. For in <HI>her hand</HI> mu&s;t that <HI>cup</HI> be found <HI>full,</HI> which the enemies of the Church from the be|ginning have been filling up, and as &s;o many rivers and fountains hath run into this great &s;ea.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is al&s;o clear, that in the <HI>la&s;t times,</HI> when the Lord &s;hall <HI>bind up the breach of his people,</HI> and <HI>heal the &s;trol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of their wound,</HI> who for &s;o long a time had been trampled under by <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> he &s;hall by &s;ome &s;ignal providences <HI>roll away this reproach</HI> and &s;candal of <HI>meanne&s;s contempt,</HI> and <HI>per&s;ecution:</HI> &s;hall put &s;ome <HI>glory</HI> on his Church, proportionable to its former aba&s;ement; yea, thus <HI>comfort her, ac|cording to the days wherein he had afflicted her,</HI> and cau&s;e his people's upri&s;ing, in mea&s;ure and kind, to an&s;wer their low and &s;uffering &s;tate from <HI>Anti|chri&s;t,</HI> even in the <HI>la&s;t time</HI> when the Lord &s;hall make them appear with <HI>the face of a Lion,</HI> when <HI>the feeble &s;hall be as David,</HI> and as the <HI>Angel of the Lord, Zach.</HI> 12. 8. Which promi&s;e doth clearly point at the Church's rai&s;ing, and delivery from An|tichri&s;t; upon the back whereof we find the Prophet doth foretell the la&s;t conver&s;ion, &amp; incoming of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. I &s;hall only add what the Scripture doth mo&s;t expre&s;ly &s;hew, that the Lord &s;hall &s;o gloriou&s;ly ap|pear in <HI>bringing his Church out of</HI> Babylon, and <HI>executing his judgment</HI> on that adver&s;ary, as in the day when he brought his people out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and therefore &s;hall they &s;ing <HI>the &s;ong of Mo&s;es and the lamb, Rev.</HI> 15. 3. his <HI>great power</HI> and <HI>out &s;tretched hand</HI> being no le&s;s di&s;cernable therein, than if they had been &s;tanding with <HI>I&s;rael</HI> at the red Sea, when they &s;aw their enemies lying dead upon the &s;hore.

(2.) <HI>That the Lord</HI> hath <HI>thus begun to appear,</HI> and make him&s;elf known to the World in the&s;e <HI>la&s;t ages,</HI> according to his word, is a thing very ea&s;y to demon|&s;trate. For,</P>
<P N="1">1.

latter days. About which we would con&s;ider the&s;e things.&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That &s;omething <HI>more than nature,</HI> a &s;pirit and re&s;olution <HI>above</HI> the ordinary rate of <HI>men,</HI> yea, &s;ome thing much <HI>above them&s;elves,</HI> their own natural temper and di&s;po&s;ition, did in their mo&s;t extream &s;ufferings oft appear; and this without the lea&s;t &s;hadow of af|fectation, and deceit. I am &s;ure, the World in the&s;e la&s;t ages, yea, the con&s;cience of their per&s;ecutors, and of the greate&s;t Athei&s;ts, mu&s;t witne&s;s this.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. The World hath been al&s;o witne&s;s, how <HI>&s;erious</HI> and <HI>deliberate</HI> the Saints were in this, that they made <HI>&s;uffe|ring</HI> their <HI>choice;</HI> which they could ea&s;ily have &s;hun|ned, at the rate of yielding &s;omething in the truth: but ere they would do this, or give the adver&s;ary &s;uch a bribe, they cho&s;e to embrace death, and go to a &s;take for Chri&s;t, even when they wanted not mo&s;t per&s;wading offers to turn them a&s;ide. For in&s;tance, I would here mention that excellent man in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s time, <HI>Julius Palmer,</HI> who not only had life, but preferment offered, if he would recant; to which his an&s;wer was, that he had quitted his <HI>living</HI> in two places for Chri&s;t, and now was ready to yield his <HI>life</HI> al&s;o on that account.

The Prince of <HI>Condee</HI> at the ma&s;&s;acre of <HI>Paris,</HI> when the King expre&s;ly &s;hewed him he &s;hould within 3 days die, if he did not renounce his Religion, told him, his e&s;tate and life were in his hand, but ere he re|nounced the truth he would quit both. <HI>Charles de Zer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ton,</HI> a Moravian Barron, of great intere&s;t and au|thority

<P>The Second is one <HI>David Macbryar,</HI> who was a member of the late Parliament, being one of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the Burrowes, a man mo&s;t notorious in the country where he lived for a lewd and gro&s;s prac|tice, but mo&s;t remarkable and known beyond others for his violence and rage again&s;t the Godly, as he &s;hewed by his carriage, both in the Parliament, and afterwards where he could have acce&s;s, did &s;et him|&s;elf to trouble and per&s;ecute &s;uch under that reproach|ful name of <HI>Fanaticks;</HI> but within &s;ome time there|after, whil&s;t we was forced to retire by rea&s;on of debt, for fear of caption, he was found one day walking alone, by one who was then come out of the North to that country, and had ridden forth, to &s;ee if he could catch any of that party whom he judged was then lurking, and &s;uppo&s;ing upon his rencounter that he was &s;urely one of the&s;e, would needs appre|hend him, but he upon his re&s;i&s;tance and &s;trugling again&s;t him was by him run through with a &s;word, and immediately killed on the place, upon that very ac|count, and per&s;wa&s;ion, that he was a <HI>Fanatick,</HI> and <HI>Rebel,</HI> as he then termed him. Thus he who had declared him&s;elf an enemy to the people of God, whom he was wont in reproach to call <HI>Fanaticks,</HI> was him&s;elf under that very notion and upon that ground cut down by one of his own &s;tamp and princi|ples.

<P>FIFTH Witne&s;s, which holds forth the Lord's eminent appearing, and &s;omething of an extraordi|nary power, in the late rai&s;ing and reformation of the Church from Antichri&s;tiani&s;m, is this, <HI>that large mea&s;ure of the Spirit, and outpouring thereof, which did convincingly follow the Go&s;pel and mini&s;try of the word in the&s;e la&s;t times;</HI> a truth which, we mu&s;t &s;ay, hath been manife&s;t, and by many &s;olemn proofs thereof de|mon&s;trated, no le&s;s than in the fir&s;t planting of the chri&s;tian Church.</P>
<P>It is undeniable, how great a witne&s;s to the truth, the <HI>Spirit</HI> and down-pouring thereof is. For this is God's own <HI>&s;eal,</HI> which is not put to a lie, or fal&s;|hood. Thus he bears witne&s;s to his <HI>work</HI> in the hearts of his people, and by this al&s;o the Lord doth &s;eal and atte&s;t the <HI>doctrine</HI> of the Church, and the <HI>commi&s;&s;ion</HI> of his &s;ervants who publi&s;h the &s;ame; yea, at &s;ome <HI>&s;pecial &s;ea&s;ons,</HI> as when the truth hath lea&s;t countenance or encouragement from without, times of contradiction when men will not receive its te&s;timony, and a &s;trong current of oppo&s;ition is to the Go&s;pel, then hath this in a more full <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> mea|&s;ure been di&s;cernable.

<PB N="392" REF="005185_0427_1016DDCA25C48888">
the adver&s;aries, to their own con&s;cience, if without &s;hut|ting their eyes they could &s;hift the conviction of a convincing appearance of God, in the power and ef|ficacy of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> even in a more than ordinary way accompanying the <HI>word</HI> and <HI>ordinances;</HI> pow|er, which carried kingdoms and cities before it, yea, in a very &s;hort time again&s;t the greate&s;t violence and oppo&s;ition. To clear this a little, I &s;hall point at &s;ome few <HI>remarkable Evidences,</HI> which might &s;tare the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of men in the face, &amp; in &s;ome mea&s;ure convince them of this truth.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is evident, that marvellous conque&s;t which the Go&s;pel had <HI>in Germany,</HI> by the mini&s;try of <HI>Lu|ther, Melanchton, Bucer, Martyr, Mu&s;culus,</HI> and a few others of tho&s;e excellent in&s;truments, whom the Lord then &s;ent forth. O was not this a day of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and the pouring forth thereof in a large mea&s;ure, a day of the go&s;pel's triumph, <HI>not by might, or by power;</HI> yet &s;uch as before it the World could not &s;tand! cities and countrys might then be &s;aid to be <HI>born at once; the arm of the Lord revealed</HI> with the &s;ame, that men were either <HI>&s;corched,</HI> or truly <HI>war|med</HI> and <HI>gained</HI> thereby. Did not that marvellous power and efficacy of the <HI>Spirit</HI> al&s;o attend the mi|ni&s;try of <HI>Zuinglius,</HI> and <HI>Oecolampadius,</HI> in <HI>Zuri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k,</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> when &s;o through a reformation follow|ed, to the throwing down of Images, aboli&s;hing of the Ma&s;s by publick authority, notwith&s;tanding of its long continuance; and all this in a &s;hort time! The Spirit, and power of God did very eminently appear al&s;o, in tho&s;e famous plantations of the Go&s;pel by the Mini&s;try of <HI>Calvin, Farel,</HI> and <HI>Viret</HI> in <HI>Geneva, L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;anna,</HI> and other adjacent Provinces. It is writ|ten in the life of <HI>Viret,</HI> that at <HI>Lyons,</HI> which was a great populous city, he preached in an open place, where divers <HI>thou&s;ands</HI> were converted to the truth; yea, &s;ome who came by with no purpo&s;e to hear,

only out of <HI>curio&s;ity</HI> &s;tepped in, were &s;o wrought and overcome with the power of the word, as for that time made them even <HI>neglect their other bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That great &s;ucce&s;s, which did attend the mini&s;try of Mr. <HI>Wi&s;hart</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> can al&s;o witne&s;s this truth: whence &s;o marvellous a change did quickly follow, in tho&s;e places where he preached, through <HI>Angus, Lo|thian,</HI> and the we&s;tern parts; yea, how much the &s;pirits of the people were then rai&s;ed and affected with the word. But this, being a thing &s;o known from the hi&s;tories of that time, I only name.</P>

But be&s;ides the&s;e famous wit|ne&s;&s;es, of who&s;e life we have &s;omething this day on publick record, I mu&s;t here crave liberty to &s;et down a few more, more late in&s;tances of our own Church in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to confirm this truth; &s;uch as are but little known to the World, nor any thing of their lives publi&s;hed, which I think a great lo&s;s to after-generations; who, we may &s;ay (and this with a warrant and in &s;obriety) were men <HI>truly extra|ordinary,</HI> eminently &s;erviceable in the work of the Lord, yea, of a <HI>Prophetick</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tolick Spirit,</HI> and &s;uch who through grace did not even come &s;hort of the <HI>fir&s;t three;</HI> I mean not only tho&s;e before mentioned, but al&s;o &s;ome of tho&s;e great lights, who were in the <HI>fir&s;t age</HI> of the Church after the a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I.

I can al&s;o add this, from very &s;ure information (and truly about any of the&s;e parti|culars, I &s;eriou&s;ly &s;tudy to have &s;atisfying grounds of the certainty thereof) that it was his u&s;age even in the colde&s;t winter-nights, to ri&s;e for prayer; and of|times his wife, who was an excellent woman, hath ri&s;en to &s;eek after him, where he hath been found lying on the ground weeping and wre&s;tling with

the Lord; yea, &s;ometimes he would have been much of the night alone in the Church of <HI>Aire</HI> on that account. One time e&s;pecially his wi&s;e finding him overcharged with grief, he told her, <HI>he had that to pre&s;s him,</HI> which &s;he had not, <HI>the &s;ouls of</HI> 3000 <HI>to an&s;wer for, while&s;t he know not how it was with many of them.</HI> And an other time while&s;t &s;he found him alone, his &s;pirit almo&s;t overcharged with angui&s;h and grief, upon her &s;erious enquiry, &s;aid, that the times which were to come on <HI>Scotland,</HI> were heavy and &s;ad, though &s;he &s;hould not &s;ee them, and this for the contempt of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>While&s;t he was pri&s;oner in the <HI>Blackne&s;s,</HI> in a let|ter to a Chri&s;tian lady, he giveth this account, <HI>What large joy he had, to &s;uffer for &s;uch a truth, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was a King, and had a vi&s;ible Kingdom in the World, even his Church, which was as free to keep its Courts, and exerci&s;e di&s;cipline by vertue of an intrin&s;ick power from Chri&s;t, as any Kingdom on the earth, for which he was ready to lay down his life, yea, would re|joyce to be offered up a &s;acrifice on &s;o glorious a truth.</HI> In the clo&s;e of that letter, he doth al&s;o forewarn, that <HI>judgment was coming to</HI> Scotland, <HI>which &s;hould be</HI> blood, <HI>fir&s;t by an inte&s;tine &s;word, and then by the &s;word of a &s;tranger, and that a great &s;acrifice &s;hould be there, both of great men, and mean.</HI> The fulfilling whereof hath &s;ince been very &s;en&s;ible, and is known by many alive, who had that letter long before the late troubles begun.

<P>The fir&s;t was this, that one night while&s;t he did expound the Scripture after his &s;upper, in the pri&s;on (as his cu&s;tom was) while&s;t he with much

power and authority was pre&s;&s;ing home the truth, one of the company who had &s;ome charge in the Ca&s;tle, fell a jearing; which <HI>Mr. Wel&s;h</HI> ob&s;erving, and looking earne&s;tly to him, did pre&s;ently clo&s;e the Bible, and cea&s;e, and a little after having a drink in his hand, be &s;aith to a friend at the table before all that were pre&s;ent, <HI>There is one &s;o profane and gro&s;s, as to contemn and mock at the word of the Lord, but ere a little God &s;hall &s;mite him with a remark|able &s;troke of his judgment.</HI> Which accordingly fell out, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the company; for <HI>that man did pre&s;ently drop down to the ground, and died.</HI> A <HI>lady</HI> that was then Popi&s;h, being pre&s;ent by rea&s;on of a friend of her's that was pri&s;oner in the ca&s;|tle, was &s;o moved therewith that it proved an help to her after-conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The other pa&s;&s;age is this, one <HI>John Steward,</HI> an eminent Chri&s;tian, who lived at <HI>Aire,</HI> having come to vi&s;it Mr. <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> in pri&s;on, found him in a more than ordinary way troubled and &s;ad, and upon his en|quiry thereabout, he &s;aith," <HI>John,</HI> ye &s;hould not be here, go home to <HI>Aire,</HI> for the <HI>plague</HI> of God is broken out in that place, and cau&s;e <HI>Hugh Kennedy</HI> pro|ve&s;t of that town (who was al&s;o a very &s;ingular Chri&s;|tian) to convene the people to the &s;treets, and pray together; and the Lord &s;hall hear <HI>Hugh Kennedy,</HI> and remove that &s;troke. This at the fir&s;t did &s;omething a&s;toni&s;h the &s;aid <HI>John,</HI> and put him to que&s;tion its truth, having &s;o lately come out of that place: but at his return found it &s;o, and accordingly in every thing it fell out as the man of God had &s;hewed.</P>
<P>After his bani&s;hment, to which the King did change the &s;entence of death pa&s;t upon him at <HI>Linlith|go,</HI> he in a very &s;hort time acquired the <HI>French tongue,</HI> with &s;uch a facility therein, as was thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">range by tho&s;e who knew it. <HI>Trochrig</HI> in his com|mentary on the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> &s;ets down this pa&s;&s;age

how being called to preach at <HI>Salmur,</HI> a famous Uni|ver&s;ity, yea, one of the mo&s;t learned auditories in <HI>France,</HI> he did with &s;uch boldne&s;s and authority preach, as though he had been before the meane&s;t congregation: whereat <HI>Trochrig</HI> being a&s;toni&s;hed, could not but on his acquaintance with him que&s;tion him thereabout, whence he had &s;uch confidence, and was &s;o little moved, whil&s;t he preached before &s;tran|gers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and judicious an auditory, and in a &s;trange tongue?

<P>Whil&s;t he was Mini&s;ter at <HI>St. Jane de Angeli,</HI> a Prote&s;tant town in <HI>France,</HI> where his Mini&s;try was much ble&s;&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s, the civil wars did break out, where that city was twice be&s;ieged on the Prote|&s;tant intere&s;t; during which time the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages fell out mo&s;t remarkable: one was, the town being &s;ore &s;traited, and ready to be taken, the enemies having rai&s;ed a battery, and by a clo&s;e approach had made a great breach in the wall, Mr. <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> hearing thereof (who had much encouraged the people, that their adver&s;aries &s;hould nor then prevail) went him&s;elf with the Canonier up the walls, and de&s;ired he would charge &s;uch a piece of cannon, and &s;hoot, for <HI>God &s;hould direct that &s;hoe and cau&s;e to pro&s;per:</HI> which accordingly did, to a&s;toni&s;hment of lookers-on, di&s;|mount that battery, and the Lord &s;o ordered things after, that the King did parley on favourable terms with the city, and did only him&s;elf with his court come in without doing any violence. Another marvellous pa&s;&s;age was this; the following Sabbath &s;ome of the godly in that place, fearing Mr. <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> his hazard, did &s;eriou&s;ly deal with him, that he
<PB N="404" REF="005185_0439_1016DDD91DBC8C80">
would forbear to go forth, and preach, the Court being there; from which he by no intreaty would be hindred, but &s;hewed them he would adventure to preach the word to his People, and tru&s;t the Lord with what concerned him&s;elf, being more grieved at their fear and de&s;pondence: and that day had a very great auditory, both of friends, and others who came upon the fame of &s;uch a man; but in time of &s;ermon, a great man of the Court with &s;ome of the King's own guard was &s;ent to bring him forth|with before the King, and whil&s;t he was entring the Church, which had &s;ome difficulty by rea&s;on of the multitude, <HI>Mr. Wel&s;h</HI> did turn him&s;elf toward that entry, and de&s;ired the people to give way to one of the great <HI>Piers</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> that was coming in; but after whil&s;t he was coming near the pulpit, to execute his commi&s;&s;ion, by putting force on the Servant of Chri&s;t, for his de&s;i&s;ting, <HI>he did with great authority &s;peak to him before all the people, and in the name of his Ma&s;ter Je&s;us Chri&s;t charged him that he would not di&s;turb the Wor&s;hip of God;</HI> wherewith that man was &s;o affrighted, that he fell a &s;haking, yea was forced to crutch down, and make no further trouble.&mdash;A third pa&s;&s;age no le&s;s remarkable was upon the clo&s;e of Sermon, whil&s;t <HI>Mr. Wel&s;h</HI> with much &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion went to the <HI>King,</HI> who was then greatly incen&s;ed, and with a threat|ning countenance a&s;ked, What he was, and how he dur&s;t preach here&s;y &s;o near his per&s;on, and with &s;uch contumacy carry him&s;elf?

(2.) <HI>That there is no &s;al|vation</HI> or deliverance from wrath <HI>by our own merits,</HI> by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> and his merit alone. (3.) I did al&s;o preach this day the <HI>ju&s;t liberties of the Kingdom of France,</HI> that <HI>your Maje&s;ty oweth obedience to Chri&s;t</HI> only, who is <HI>Head</HI> of the Church; and that the <HI>Pope,</HI> as he is an <HI>enemy to Chri&s;t,</HI> and his truth, &s;o al&s;o to the Kings of the earth, whom he keepeth under &s;lavery to his u&s;urped power. Whereat the <HI>King</HI> for a time keeping &s;ilence, with great a&s;toni&s;hment, turned to &s;ome about him, and &s;aid, <HI>Surely this is a man of God!</HI> Yea, after did commune with him, and with great re&s;pect di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him. The year following, whil&s;t the differences betwixt the King and Prote&s;tant party did grow, that city was again be&s;ieged, taken, and in part &s;acked as Mr. <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> did publickly foretell: at which time, it is known, how the <HI>King</HI> pa&s;t a &s;olemn <HI>order,</HI> that none &s;hould in the lea&s;t wrong Mr. <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> or any thing that belonged to him, under high|e&s;t pains, and did after give a <HI>&s;afe conduct</HI> to him, for tran&s;porting him&s;elf to <HI>England,</HI> where he died; King <HI>James</HI> refu&s;ing his return to his own country, though earne&s;tly petitioned by his wife, for her hu&s;|band's health.</P>
<P>During his &s;ickne&s;s, he was &s;o filled and overcome with the &s;en&s;ible enjoyment of God, that he was &s;ometime overheard in prayer, to have the&s;e words, <HI>Lord, hold thy hand, it is enough! thy &s;ervant is a clay ve&s;&s;el, and can hold no more!</HI></P>
<P>II. I &s;hall al&s;o here in&s;tance Mr. <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> who in a very extraordinary way was called to the Mini&s;try, having for a long time followed the &s;tudy of the <HI>Law,</HI> both in this country and in <HI>France,</HI> yea, had &s;ome ground to expect a place among&s;t the Lord's of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his father being then a con&s;iderable Barron,
<PB N="406" REF="005185_0441_1016DDDDE8DF1E98">
who had many friends: but a more pre&s;&s;ing and ir|re&s;i&s;tible call from God did otherwi&s;e determine.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was in the Mini&s;try at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> he &s;hined as a great light through the whole land: the power and efficacy of the SPIRIT mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly accom|panying the word he preached, he was a terrour to evil doers: and the authority of God did &s;o appear up|on him and his carriage, with &s;uch a Maje&s;ty in his countenance, as forced fear and re&s;pect from the greate&s;t in the land, even tho&s;e who were mo&s;t avow|ed haters of Godline&s;s; yea, it was known, what an awful impre&s;&s;ion King <HI>James</HI> had of him, and did once give him that te&s;timony before many, that he judged Mr. <HI>Bruce</HI> was worthy of the <HI>half of his King|dom.</HI></P>
<P>He was a man that had much <HI>inward exerci&s;e</HI> about his own per&s;onal ca&s;e; had been oft a&s;&s;aulted about that great foundation of truth, if there was a God; which co&s;t him many days and nights wre&s;tling, and when he hath come up to the pulpit, after being &s;ometimes &s;ilent, which was his u&s;ual way, he would &s;ay, <HI>I think it is a great matter to believe there is a God;</HI> telling the People, it was an other thing to <HI>be|lieve that,</HI> than they judged. But it was al&s;o known, by his friends with whom he was familiar, what ex|traordinary <HI>confirmations</HI> he had from the Lord there|in, what near familiarity he did attain in his &s;ecret conver&s;e with God: yea, truly &s;ome things, I have had from per&s;ons worthy of credit thereabout, would &s;eem &s;o &s;trange and marvellous, that I forbear to &s;et them down.</P>
<P>The great &s;ucce&s;s of his Mini&s;try at <HI>Edinburgh, Inverne&s;s,</HI> and other places whither providence cal|led him, is abundantly known. Whil&s;t he was con|fined at <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> that poor dark country was mar|vellou&s;ly enlightned, many brought in to Chri&s;t by his Mini&s;try, and a &s;eed &s;own in the&s;e places, which
<PB N="407" REF="005185_0442_1016DE214D1C4ED8">
even to this day is not wholly worn out. I &s;hall here &s;et down one pa&s;&s;age of famous Mr. <HI>Hender&s;on,</HI> who at his fir&s;t entry to the Mini&s;try at <HI>Leuchars,</HI> was very prelatick, and by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> brought in again&s;t the pari&s;h's con&s;ent, &s;o that on the day of his admi&s;&s;ion, the Church doors being &s;hut by the People, they were forced to break in by a window to get him entrance. But a little after this, upon the report of a Communion, where Mr. <HI>Bruce</HI> was to help, he would needs from a longing he had to hear and &s;ee &s;uch a man, go <HI>&s;ecretly</HI> there; and placed him&s;elf in a <HI>dark</HI> part of the Church, where he might not be known: when Mr. <HI>Bruce</HI> was come to the pulpit, he did for a con&s;iderable time keep &s;ilence, as his maner was, which did &s;ome way a&s;toni&s;h Mr. <HI>Hender&s;on,</HI> but much more when he heard the fir&s;t words wherewith he begun, which were the&s;e, <HI>He that cometh not in by the door, but climbeth up ano|ther way, the &s;ame is a thief and a robber.</HI> Which did by the Lord's ble&s;&s;ing at the very pre&s;ent take him by the heart, and had &s;o great an impre&s;&s;ion on him, that it was the fir&s;t means of his conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>He was one that had <HI>the &s;pirit of di&s;cerning</HI> in a great mea&s;ure, did <HI>prophetically</HI> &s;peak of many things which afterwards came to pa&s;s; yea, which I had atte&s;ted by &s;ober and grave Chri&s;tians, who were familiar with him, that divers per&s;ons di&s;tracted, and of tho&s;e who were pa&s;&s;ed all hope of recovery in the falling &s;ickne&s;s, were brought to Mr. <HI>Bruce,</HI> and after prayer by him in their behalf were fully recovered. This indeed may &s;eem &s;trange, but it is al&s;o true; Mr. <HI>Bruce</HI> was a great wre&s;tler, who had more than ordinary familiarity with his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>A little before his death, when he was at <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> and through weakne&s;s kept his chamber, there was a meeting of divers godly Mini&s;ters at that time there, on &s;ome &s;pecial ground of the Church's con|cernment,
<PB N="408" REF="005185_0443_1016DDE0903AD4B8">
who hearing he was in the town came to|gether, and gave him an account of the actings of tho&s;e times, the Prelates then de&s;igning the &s;ervice book: after which Mr. <HI>Bruce</HI> prayed, and did therein tell over again to the Lord the very &s;ub&s;tance of their di&s;cour&s;e, which was a &s;ad repre&s;entation of the ca&s;e of the Church, at which time there was &s;uch an <HI>extraordinary</HI> MOTION <HI>on all pre&s;ent, &s;o &s;en&s;ible a downpouring of the</HI> SPIRIT, <HI>that they could hardly contain them&s;elves;</HI> yea, which was mo&s;t &s;trange, even &s;ome <HI>unu&s;ual motion</HI> on the&s;e who were in <HI>other parts of the hou&s;e,</HI> not knowing the cau&s;e at that very in&s;tant. One Mr. <HI>Weemes</HI> of <HI>Lothaker</HI> being then occa&s;ionally pre&s;ent, when he went away, &s;aid, <HI>O how &s;trange a man is this! for he knocked down the Spirit of God on us all.</HI> This he &s;aid becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Bruce</HI> did divers times <HI>knock with his fingers on the table.</HI> I had this from a worthy Chri&s;tian Gentleman, in who&s;e mother's hou&s;e this was.</P>
<P>He was deeply affected with the naughtine&s;s and prophanity of many <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> then in the Church, and the un&s;uitable carriage of others to &s;o great a calling; and did expre&s;s much his fear, that the mini&s;try of <HI>Scotland</HI> would prove the greate&s;t per&s;ecutors of the Go&s;pel that it had. If there were a full collection of tho&s;e remarkable pa&s;&s;ages, which have been known to others in his life, it would further witne&s;s what an extraordinary man that was. I &s;hall only &s;hut this up with learned <HI>Didoclavius's</HI> te&s;timony, in his Pre|face to his <HI>Altare Dama&s;cenum:</HI> Robertus Bru&s;ius, <HI>Vir|genere &amp; virtue nobilis, maje&s;tate vultus venerabilis, qui plura animarum millia Chri&s;to lucrifecit; cujus anima, &s;t ullius mortalium (ab&s;it verbo invidia) &s;edet in coel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ti|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">us: anima mea, cum anima tua, Bru&s;t, &s;i ex a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ena <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ide e&s;&s;et pendendum.</HI></P>

III. Mr. <HI>David&s;on,</HI> Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel at <HI>Salt-Pre&s;toun,</HI> may be truly here in&s;tanced as one of an <HI>extraordinary, prophetick Spirit,</HI> who was likewi&s;e eminently zealous and faithful for his Ma&s;ter in a time of the Church's defection; as <HI>Didoclavius</HI> in that forementioned preface terms him, <HI>Cato et con&s;tans Cato &s;ui temporis.</HI> He did then fore&s;ee Prelacies breaking in upon the Church, when King <HI>James</HI> were pre&s;&s;ing the &s;etting up of <HI>Superin|tendents</HI> under a very &s;pecious pretext, and was for that end him&s;elf pre&s;ent at the A&s;&s;embly in <HI>Dundee,</HI> hav|ing engaged many, ala&s;s too many! to con&s;ent thereto, but Mr. <HI>David&s;on</HI> with great boldne&s;s ro&s;e up, and warned the a&s;&s;embly of the hazard, and told them he &s;aw the <HI>knave Bi&s;hop,</HI> with his mitre, com|ing in under that ma&s;k, yea, did &s;olemnly in his own name, and name of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> en|ter a prote&s;tation again&s;t that &s;tep of defection, and their yielding up in &s;o far the liberties of the Church, to plea&s;e men.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was Mini&s;ter at <HI>Salt-Pre&s;toun,</HI> the build|ing of a Church was by him much endeavoured, which he did advance much out of his own private intere&s;t; my Lord <HI>Newbatle</HI> who then had a great intere&s;t in the Pari&s;h engaging to help it forward: from which he after re&s;iled, and thereby fru&s;trated the work.

At a certain a&s;&s;embly of the Church, Mr. <HI>John Spot&s;|wood</HI> &amp; Mr. <HI>James Law,</HI> who were then entered in|to the mini&s;try, were proce&s;&s;ed for &s;ome gro&s;s acts of prophanity: where Mr. <HI>David&s;on</HI> finding the a&s;&s;embly too ea&s;y to pa&s;s the &s;ame, in regard of their parts and gifts, only with a rebuke, he did with much vehemency pre&s;s their depo&s;ition; and after being cro&s;&s;ed therein, &s;aid, <HI>You will needs &s;pare the&s;e two men, whereat I am grieved, but the time is coming when they &s;hall trample upon your necks and upon the Church of</HI> Scotland.

<P>Being with Mr. <HI>Bruce</HI> one time at dinner, who was then in great favour with the King, he had the&s;e words in giving thanks after meat. <HI>Lord, thy &s;ervant here is now a great favourite of the Court, and in much re|&s;pect: but he &s;hall be within a little as much per&s;ecuted as he is now in favour, and go down the &s;treets, when many who have him this day in e&s;teem will not give him a &s;alu|tation.</HI> Which was very manife&s;t afterwards. And at another time, whil&s;t Mr. <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> and he were dining together in the hou&s;e of one of the Magi&s;trates of the town, who was then a cordial friend to godly Mini&s;ters, he did al&s;o in his plain and free way break forth with the&s;e words, whil&s;t he was giving thanks, <HI>Lord, this good man hath re&s;pect for thy &s;ake to thy &s;ervants, but he little knoweth that in a &s;hort time he mu&s;t carry us both, who are here to pri&s;on.</HI> Which words did much trouble that hone&s;t man, tho' afterwards it came mo&s;t exactly to pa&s;s.</P>

IV.

It is known, with what zeal he did oppo&s;e him&s;elf to the corruptions of that time.

<P>One is, that being on a certain night under an ex|traordinary pre&s;&s;ure of &s;pirit to go and pour forth his heart to God, he left his wi&s;e in bed, and going out to a garden, &s;pent mo&s;t of the night in that exerci&s;e (a thing &s;o ordinary to him that he u&s;ed to &s;ay, he wondered how a Chri&s;tian could lie a bed all night, without ri&s;ing to &s;pend &s;ome of the night in prayer and prai&s;e!) but his wife weary, at la&s;t went to &s;eek for him, but mi&s;&s;ing him in his ordinary place, went into other gardens, by &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as &s;he knew, at la&s;t &s;he heard a voice, and drawing near to it, could hear him &s;peak a few words, but with great force and fervency, mixed and accom|panied with floods of tears; which were the&s;e, <HI>O God, wilt thou not give me</HI> Scotland! <HI>O God, wilt thou not give me</HI> Scotland!&mdash;She being weary, and a|fraid to interrupt him, went home, and heard not the clo&s;e.

Well, &s;aid he, you had better have been in your bed, but &s;ince ye heard, I tell you, I have indured a great fight for <HI>Scotland</HI> this night, and hardly could I get a remnant re&s;erved, yet <HI>he will be gracious.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="424" REF="005185_0459_1016DE38ECED1940">
After this he aro&s;e another night, but went not out of doors, but in a chamber he travelled and groaned &s;o, as that his wife impatient did ri&s;e &s;everal times, calling him to bed; but he waited his time: and when he came, &s;he began a mode&s;t expo&s;tulation with him for tarrying. <HI>Hold thy peace,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>it will be well with us; but I &s;hall never preach another preach|ing in</HI> Aire.&mdash;And having fallen a&s;leep, before he a|waked, the me&s;&s;enger was come, who by command carried him pri&s;oner to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>

<P>III.

When &s;he drew near her di&s;&s;olution, &s;he be|came wor&s;e both in body and &s;pirit; and &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Scrimger,</HI> who at that time took two of his elders with him, and in their pre&s;ence fir&s;t endeavoured to comfort her by exhortation and conference, then he pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, and &s;eeing her the nearer her end &s;eemingly the wor&s;e, he made &s;ome of the elders to pray, and again he him&s;elf prayed.

<P>IV.

Upon his fir&s;t coming forth to preach, he by a remar|kable providence had Ma&s;ter <HI>Bruce,</HI> whom you have formerly mentioned, to be his hearer; and as I heard him&s;elf declare, it was his de&s;ire to have the judgment of &s;o great a man upon his di&s;cour&s;e; who&s;e cen&s;ure, he &s;aid, he would never forget, it had been &s;o much ble&s;&s;ed.

One pa&s;&s;age whil&s;t he was there, I did hear him relate: upon the re|port of &s;ome &s;inful oath to be pre&s;&s;ed upon the Ma&s;ters of the college, he inquired at a fellow-Regent of his, Mr. <HI>Gawin For&s;yth,</HI> what he would do in that matter? who&s;e an&s;wer was, <HI>By my faith, I mu&s;t live.</HI> To whom Mr. <HI>Blair</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Sir, I will not &s;wear by my faith, as you do; but truly I intend to live by my faith.

When he came to the place, he found, the <HI>Dean</HI> was indeed lying &s;ick, and though a mo&s;t naughty man, made him not only welcome upon his vi&s;it, but incouraged him to hold on in his way, and told him he was to &s;ucceed him in that change; yea, he &s;poke &s;o unlike him&s;elf, and in a &s;train &s;o different from what was u&s;ual unto him, that a Gentlewoman &s;tanding by &s;aid to &s;ome&punc; others, an <HI>Angel</HI> is &s;peaking out of the Dean's bed to Mr. <HI>Blair;</HI> thinking, it could not be &s;uch a man.</P>
<P>He had been once troubled with an appearing of the <HI>Devil,</HI> whil&s;t he was a Regent in the college; who, like a crooked boy that waited on him, &s;tood up and laughed him in the face, whil&s;t he was &s;erious in his chamber, and immediately di&s;appeared: but after,

<P>After &s;ome time in the Mini&s;try at <HI>Bangor,</HI> he with others of his worthy brethren was <HI>&s;ilenced</HI> by the bi&s;hop; and as he told him&s;elf, was in the Church when the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> (one <HI>Eckline</HI>) did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|&s;elf intimate the &s;entence. Upon which, Mr. <HI>Blair</HI> ro&s;e
<PB N="431" REF="005185_0466_1016DE88E724EB78">
up publickly in the congregation, and with great Au|thority did cite the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> to appear before the tribu|nal of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to an&s;wer for what he was doing, contrary to his own light and con&s;cience, again&s;t tho&s;e whom he knew to be faithful Mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel: whereupon the man was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed, that he imme|diately cried out, I appeal from the tribunal of the ju&s;tice of God to the throne of his mercy! To whom Mr. <HI>Blair</HI> replies; Sir, your appeal is rejected: for you know, what you are doing is directly again&s;t your con|&s;cience, which hath made you bear witne&s;s to us as the &s;ervants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>Whil&s;t under re&s;traint, he was by his brethren &s;ent to <HI>England,</HI> to deal with the <HI>King</HI> for their liberty. When he was on the road, he was taken with a mighty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it of the &s;tone, which made him lie upon his hor&s;e's neck, not being able to hold up his back; which much di&s;quieted him, as being a probable let upon &s;uch an important bu&s;ine&s;s. And in this po&s;ture he turned to the Lord in prayer; but immediately after, e&s;&s;aying if he could po&s;&s;ibly lift up his back, he found to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">o|ni&s;hment, his tormenting pain quite gone, and per|fect ea&s;e, nor did it recur to him for two years after. A few days after, in the &s;ame journey, his hor&s;e fell very lame; which did in &s;ome mea&s;ure trouble him, having no convenient acce&s;s to provide him&s;elf of an other: and even upon this, did addre&s;s to the Lord by prayer, that in &s;uch a &s;trait he might be helped, which he graciou&s;ly conde&s;cended to do, &s;o that the hor&s;e was to his amazement healed, and without the lea&s;t halt did carry him to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was there, he did e&s;&s;ay what he could to accompli&s;h his bu&s;ine&s;s, but could have no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> the <HI>King;</HI> yea, &s;ome who were his friends at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> a&s;&s;ured him, he had no ground to hope in that mat|ter:

yet he re&s;olved to continue, and roll the bu&s;ine&s;s over on the Lord, for who&s;e &s;ervice he was only im|portuning an open door. And one day having gone to <HI>Greenwitch,</HI> where the court then was, being wearied with waiting without acce&s;s, he retired into the park to pray, where after much wre&s;tling with the Lord, he was in a more than ordinary way brought near, and had &s;o clear a return, that he could not with&s;tand the a&s;&s;urance he got, that his way &s;hould be &s;ucce&s;sful: but the appearance thereof in an ordinary way being &s;o &s;mall, pre&s;&s;ed him to adventure humbly the a&s;king of a <HI>&s;ign</HI> from the Lord; and immediately, after there being a con&s;iderable <HI>wind</HI> that blew hard and made a noi&s;e among the bulru&s;hes that grew there, &s;o great a <HI>calm</HI> did pre&s;ently follow, that not the lea&s;t plant of the ground did any ways move or &s;tir. He went thence to <HI>London,</HI> and within a few days in a mo&s;t &s;trange way had his petition pre&s;ented to the <HI>King,</HI> and accep|ted; yea, in St. <HI>James</HI>'s park was particularly called for, where the <HI>King</HI> with his own hand did not only &s;ign it, but wrote the&s;e words in the margin, which he directed to the Deputy, <HI>Indulge the education of the&s;e Mini&s;ters, for they are Scots-men.</HI></P>
<P>When he was in <HI>England,</HI> he had a &s;trange di&s;covery of his wife (an excellent gentlewoman) her dying, and that &s;he was lying in &s;uch a bed, and a Chri&s;tian friend of his particular acquaintance be&s;ide her. When he come home, he found his wife in health; but a little after, &s;he fell &s;ick and died in that &s;ame bed, with that friend &s;itting by her, and with all tho&s;e particular circum&s;tances.

V. This &s;eems an eminent in&s;tance of the provi|dence of God, and worthy to be on record, that con|cerns the Laird of <HI>Raith,</HI> of a known and ancient family in this country, who in the beginning of the reformation was a profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Papi&s;t;</HI> but the Lord di|recting that great &s;ervant of his, Mr. <HI>Wi&s;hart,</HI> one night very late to his hou&s;e, who after &s;ome repul&s;e from a &s;ervant got acce&s;s to this Gentleman, and told him, He was come with the offer of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t to him, and his family, if he would receive it; which was in that manner backed with the autho|rity of God, and his power on that Gentleman's con|&s;cience, that he mo&s;t kindly received Mr. <HI>Wi&s;hart,</HI> and told him, His offer was welcome.

much delight: at dinner <HI>Faber</HI> became exceedingly &s;ad, and now and then fell out in bitter weeping; at which the Queen complained, and inquiring the cau&s;e, why he weeped whil&s;t &s;he had come to be merry with him, he in the end &s;aid, Mo&s;t &s;erene Queen, how can I be glad, or make others glad, who am as wicked a man as the earth bears<HI>!</HI> And what is that wicked|ne&s;s, &s;ays &s;he, you have committed, who are known from your youth to have lived &s;o holy?

This was not known until his death, that &s;ome of the&s;e found them&s;elves obliged to make it known. Some time after he had be&s;towed this money, the plague having been &s;ore in <HI>Air,</HI> and trade much decayed, he him&s;elf fell under &s;ome &s;traits, and &s;ome of the pro|phane in that place begun to make it their b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t that <HI>Religion</HI> had made him <HI>poor,</HI> and his giving much to others like a fool had made him now want him&s;elf: the profe&s;&s;ion and the credit of it was always this godly man's darling, which made him quit the country at that time; and borrowing a little money, he went over to <HI>France,</HI> that he might the better con|ceal his &s;trait.

<P>IX. There is a &s;trange pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Judgment,</HI> that among&s;t the memorable things of the providence of God I think worthy of in&s;erting; it concerns a <HI>Noble-man</HI> in our own country (who&s;e name, with re&s;pect to his hou&s;e, I forbear to mention) who for many years by blood and cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion made him&s;elf a <HI>terror</HI> in that place of the country where he lived. One day his &s;econd &s;on, who after &s;ucceeded to that hou&s;e, by the death of his brother, found a letter &s;ealed and directed to his father, bearing the &s;tile of his hou&s;e, and without any &s;u&s;picion whence it came, carried it up to his chamber: which that Lord breaking open, found it of a &s;trange &s;tile; for it had the&s;e words, <HI>I &s;ummon you&mdash;to appear before the tribunal of God, and there an&s;wer for your murders, oppre&s;&s;ions,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Sub&s;cribitur</HI> DIA|BOLUS, Upon which, he being inraged, drew his &s;word, to have run his &s;on thorow, &s;uppo&s;ing it a con|trived bu&s;ine&s;s by him; but he e&s;caped, and was forced for many months to withdraw from the hou&s;e. How|ever upon the interce&s;&s;ion of friends, his father did con|de&s;cend to admit him again; but that very day, whil&s;t they were met on this account, that Noble-man wa&s;h|ing his hands in his bed-chamber (and one of his &s;er|vants by) a letter from the roof of that chamber drops down upon his hands, &s;ealed and directed as before, which being opened, had the very &s;ame words of the former letter, with that dreadful &s;ub&s;cription, DIABO|LUS. After which, by immediate &s;troke of the Lord's
<PB N="446" REF="005185_0481_1016DE5638A432C8">
hand, he was &s;truck with a remarkable infatuation, and &s;uch an horror and fear upon his con&s;cience, that upon the appearance of the lea&s;t boy he would have fled, and with howling &s;ought to have &s;heltered him&s;elf under a bed, and in this ca&s;e &s;hortly died; having been made a <HI>terror to him&s;elf,</HI> and the mean|e&s;t per&s;on able to qua&s;h him, who made it his work to be terrible to <HI>others</HI> in his life. This (far from reflecting upon the hou&s;e or family) with re|&s;pect to the holding forth the holy and righteous Judg|ment of the Lord, I could not omit to in&s;ert the &s;ame, after &s;ome &s;afe warrant, as to the certainty thereof, from tho&s;e I had ground to believe.

<P>We do here under&s;tand by &s;uch providences, tho&s;e wherein man cannot but &s;ee &s;omething <HI>above nature</HI> and natural cau&s;es, yea, above the <HI>ordinary</HI> way of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Lord's working,</HI> which do evidently witne&s;s his great and immediate hand: &s;ome whereof have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> wonderful, which can be in&s;tanced in the&s;e late times, as might truly be called miracles.

Thus we find, the Lord did confirm the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> breaking out of the Go&s;pel, and make u&s;e of &s;uch a mean to &s;pread the Chri&s;tian Church through the World: and &s;hould this &s;eem &s;trange, that in &s;o great a change of the Church's ca&s;e now in the <HI>latter</HI> days, when he was to rai&s;e her up, after &s;o long a ruin and de&s;ola|tion, whil&s;t Antichri&s;tiani&s;m &s;o many ages had o|ver&s;pread the face of the World, that he &s;hould thus appear, and give &s;ome &s;ignal demon&s;tration of his power in behalf of his People, &s;uch as we have &s;een with our eyes, and our Fathers did tell us!</P>
<P>It is not miracles, or any extraordinary provi|dence, on which men &s;hould re&s;olve their <HI>faith:</HI> nor do we here mention the&s;e, for laying &s;tre&s;s, thereon in believing the truth.

This, even this is the <HI>rea&s;on of our hope,</HI> which we offer to all that a&s;k for the &s;ame&punc; and there let the God of truth, who hath revealed his will and an|&s;wers men by the written word, be judge; &amp; we &s;hall demand no greater advantage or ju&s;tice at the hand of our enemies.

And truly tho&s;e <HI>lying wonders,</HI> which have been &s;o frequent in the World, which the Apo&s;tle doth foretell, that &s;uch an engine the Devil will make u&s;e of, to turn men a&s;ide from the truth, be&s;ides other marks of their fal&s;hood, they have this one mo&s;t di&s;cernable, that they are the &s;upport and warrant of

<P>I would de&s;ire to be very tender and cautious up|on &s;uch a &s;ubject: for I judge it horrid divinity, to make a <HI>lye for God.</HI> It is not the truth, but a fal&s;e way which requireth &s;uch a help. And truly as to the&s;e following in&s;tances (which are but a few of ma|ny that might be brought, if there were more &s;eri|ous enquiry) I dare atte&s;t the Lord, the great witne&s;s, that I have not knowingly &s;et down here any thing fal&s;e; yea, not without &s;ome diligent &s;earch, and &s;atisfying grounds about the certainty thereof.

<P><HI>Charles</HI> the IX. of <HI>France,</HI> who was author of that horrid Ma&s;&s;acre, where the blood of many thou&s;and Prote&s;tants at <HI>Paris</HI> and other parts was &s;hed, did a very little after die in the &s;trength of his years, by an extraordinary effu&s;ion of blood from all pa&s;&s;ages of his body, that as <HI>Du Serres</HI> and other french writers of that time do &s;hew, he was made to wallow in his own blood before his death. O was not this the very <HI>finger of God,</HI> a mo&s;t convincing &s;tupendious piece of his judgment?</P>
<P>What an extraordinary providence was that, which is atte&s;ted by divers witne&s;&s;es thereto, in the late bloody Ma&s;&s;acre of <HI>Ireland;</HI> a young woman, who by the Iri&s;h was &s;tript almo&s;t naked, and after by one of them threatned, that except &s;he would give him her money, he would forthwith run her thro'; to which &s;he gravely an&s;wered, <HI>I know you cannot kill me, except God give you leave.</HI> Whereupon he did three times with his &s;word run at her naked body, but could not once pierce her &s;kin; which did &s;o confound this wretched man, that with a kind of horror he went away, and cea&s;ed to trouble her further.</P>
<P>Did not God wonderfully appear in the rai&s;ing of the late King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> with that a&s;toni&s;hing &s;uc|ce&s;s, which did ateend him in breaking the power of the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> whil&s;t they were at &s;o great an height, and had their hands hot reeking in the blood of the Prote&s;tants thro' <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and other places of <HI>Germany!</HI> O but the Lord's hand might be clearly &s;een in acting forth and fitting that party of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> for &s;uch a piece of his &s;ervice, even in a more than ordinary way; who like that <HI>He-Geat,</HI> mentioned in <HI>Daniel,</HI> did come &s;o &s;wiftly, that they tou|ched

<P>The breaking of that great <HI>Spani&s;h Armado</HI> in the Year 88. which had been 3 Years in contriving, did convincingly witne&s;s a divine hand oppo&s;ing the &s;ame. And how remarkable was that i&s;&s;ue of all the Coun&s;els, expence, and cruelty, which <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd had made u&s;e of to bear down the ri&s;ing of the Go&s;pel in the <HI>Netherlands!</HI> For it is notorious, that after many e&s;&s;ays the lo&s;s of an 100 Millions of gold, with near 400000 Lives, the reckoning of all his gain and purcha&s;e was only the lo&s;s of a con&s;iderable part of the&s;e countries, and helping forward the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the united Provinces. And truly we mu&s;t &s;ay the Lord did by his great and out&s;tretched hand won|derfully appear in rai&s;ing that Common-wealth, &s;o that they may date their flouri&s;hing in outward intere&s;t from their owning of the intere&s;t of God.

<P>The breaking of that formidable league of the Ca|tholicks in <HI>France,</HI> for rooting out the Prote&s;tant Re|ligion there, was very wonderful, how all their Coun|&s;els and de&s;igns &s;hould re&s;olve in their own ruin; &s;o that the mo&s;t ordinary lookers on could not but &s;ee a divine hand counteracting the &s;ame. <HI>Davila,</HI> tho' an adver&s;ary, in &s;etting down that hi&s;tory, giveth a large account of this.</P>
<P>What a great appearance of the Lord's hand, yea, of an extraordinary providence, was there in the throwing down of the <HI>Popi&s;h images</HI> and <HI>altars,</HI> almo&s;t in one night, thro' much of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> which for &s;o many 100 years had been made u&s;e of for Idolatry?

The authors did never appear, nor any noi&s;e of their boa&s;ting thereabout; and which was &s;trange, the Magi&s;trates of the cities having both power and will to hinder, yet were &s;o overruled and &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment, that they could not re&s;i&s;t. And as <HI>Famianus Strada,</HI> a great enemy to the truth, doth &s;hew what fell out in <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and other places, con&s;idering the greatne&s;s of the work, the multitude, and height of tho&s;e idolatrous monu|ments, it might have been enough for many days, what was done in one night; and yet not any in the lea&s;t prejudiced or hurt thereby, which made him cry out, that &s;ure this was the work of the Devil, and his help eminently therein. But I do not wonder, to hear the&s;e in &s;uch a manner bla&s;pheme, whil&s;t they are tormented with &s;o clear a di&s;covery of God's hand again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t we not here mention that great deliverance of the town of <HI>Leyden</HI> from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> with a &s;pecial remark, whil&s;t it was then manife&s;t, if the enemy had made u&s;e of Cannon in battering the walls, they could not have come &s;hort of their de&s;ign?

<P>What wonderful providences did attend the actings of that poor handful of prote&s;tants in the Valleys of <HI>Piemont,</HI> for their nece&s;&s;ary &s;elf-defence! Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> and other writers, give a clear account in &s;etting down that horrid per&s;ecution, which they endured in the year 1555. I &s;hall here only touch &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages men|tioned by Mr. <HI>Morland,</HI> in his Hi&s;tory; who upon the account of that bloody Ma&s;&s;acre, which was there within the&s;e few years, was then near that place, and from &s;ure knowledge and information doth very gravely hold forth the &s;ame. And truly they are providences &s;o marvellous and a&s;toni&s;hing, that men cannot but &s;ee the Lord in an extraor|dinary way helping that poor People, his acting forth a &s;ew to do &s;uch exploits, beyond any thing that can be mentioned of tho&s;e great Heroes, whom the World in former years did admire; &s;o that we mu&s;t &s;ay, as this was a convincing proof of the great power of God, put forth for his People, when help in an ordinary way failed, it was al&s;o a &s;olemn te&s;timo|ny to their cau&s;e, and of the Lord's approbation of his People &s;tanding for their own defence, again&s;t the cruelty and violence of a per&s;ecuting Magi&s;trate. We have there held forth, how after that bloody per&s;e|cution, by an order from the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> a &s;mall number was in a remarkable way rai&s;ed up, and upon their fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay 7 or 8 under the conduct of that wor|thy Gentleman <HI>Jo&s;ua Gianavel</HI> (whom God made u&s;e of as a choi&s;e in&s;trument, to help that poor &s;cattered rampant) was made to fight 300 &s;ouldiers, who were &s;ent to exerci&s;e further cruelty in that place, killing many of them, and pur&s;uing the re&s;t for a con&s;iderable time. After, a party of 500 being &s;ent by the Mar|qui&s;e of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> who then commanded the Duke of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, were oppo&s;ed by 11 of the Prote&s;|tants,

and other 6 with &s;lings: and after a &s;hort conflict, were forc'd to flee with a con&s;iderable &s;laughter; the terror of the Lord upon the one, and a &s;pirit of courage &amp; re&s;olution in the other being very manife&s;t. After the&s;e, there was an other party &s;ent forth of 700 &s;ouldiers, to &s;eize on all the pa&s;&s;ages: upon which a|bout 17 Ma&s;ters of families, who&s;e hearts God had in &s;ignal manner &s;trengthned to the battel, for their poor brethren's pre&s;ervation, re&s;olved to ca&s;t them|&s;elves upon the Lord for the &s;ucce&s;s of their undertak|ings, and with &s;uch marvellous boldne&s;s faced their adver&s;aries, as put them in amazement, and made them draw off, re&s;olving to take another way; but were &s;till pur&s;ued by this little handful, who killed many without the lo&s;s of one man. At an another time the Prote&s;tants there joyning in a greater number, being 300 under the conduct of the forementioned Captain <HI>Gianavel,</HI> were a&s;&s;aulted by 2500 of the adver&s;aries: but the Lord &s;o ordered, that this little party getting the advantage of the place, after &s;ome conflict did force then to retire, pur&s;uing them into the woods and &s;teep rocks with great &s;laughter; and thus with a marvellous courage in a continued fight for eight hours together, did drive the enemy before them. Divers other remarkable pa&s;&s;ages of this kind are more at length mentioned in that Hi&s;tory; which the Author, after mo&s;t exact &s;earch and enquiry, doth &s;olemnly atte&s;t. And truly it might be much cau&s;e for wonder (as it is there ob&s;erved) that through the Lord's eminent appearance, and his ble&s;|&s;ing on his poor people's endeavours, for the intere&s;t of Religion, and their own pre&s;ervation, they did in a &s;hort time di&s;pute the matter with &s;uch a pro&s;|perous &s;ucce&s;s, again&s;t all the forces, which the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> &s;ent, that their enemies at la&s;t began to fear what effect it might produce: and therefore having no better game to play, were glad by a

treaty of peace, to get the &s;word out of their hands; however they pretended it as a complement, put on neighbouring Princes, who did interceed for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Have we not al&s;o to reckon among the great works of the Lord in the&s;e la&s;t times, <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. of <HI>England,</HI> mo&s;t violent in oppo&s;ition to the truth, who by the Pope was &s;tiled <HI>Defender of the Faith,</HI> upon that account, and for his writing again&s;t <HI>Luther:</HI> and yet the &s;ame man &s;hall be the in&s;tru|ment made u&s;e of by the Lord, to throw down the Pope, and his power in his Dominions, and give &s;ome beginning to a great Reformation of the Church there.</P>
<P><HI>Vergerius,</HI> the Pope's Nuncio, for many years in <HI>Germany,</HI> whil&s;t he is writing again&s;t this truth, is even then converted, and forced to yield to the pow|er of the &s;ame, turns Prote&s;tant, and a zealous Preacher of the Go&s;pel to his death.</P>
<P><HI>Galeacaeus Carracciolus,</HI> an Italian Marqui&s;e, of great place and e&s;tate in the World, was &s;o taken by the heart with one word, hearing <HI>Peter Mar|tyr,</HI> as made him quit not only all his hopes of preferment, a mo&s;t plea&s;ant place as was in the earth, and a great inheritance; but to with|&s;tand the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing intreaties and in&s;inuations of his friends, the weeping cries of his Lady and Children, and go to a &s;trange place quitting all, that he might pre&s;erve his con&s;cience, and enjoy fellow&s;hip with the Church.

<P>And in a word, what a marvellous thing was it, that poor <HI>Luther,</HI> again&s;t whom &s;o much of the World was aloft with greate&s;t rage and violence, &s;hould yet live to an <HI>old age,</HI> and <HI>go to the grave in peace!</HI> And truly the &s;pirit and appearance of this great and

fir&s;t witne&s;s to the truth, might be a convincing evi|dence, that the Lord was then about to <HI>rai&s;e up a people to him&s;elf,</HI> in whom he would be glorified, by an ac|tive te&s;timony, as well as by &s;uffering.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e in&s;tances, I would here mention &s;ome remarkable providences, worthy indeed to be ob&s;erv|ed, tho' they are little known to the World: which, we may &s;ay, do not only witne&s;s the power of God, but are a convincing &s;eal to his truth, and the Church's Reformation in the&s;e la&s;t times.</P>
<P>It is a remarkable pa&s;&s;age, which worthy Mr. <HI>Forbes</HI> &s;ets down under his hand, whil&s;t he was bani&s;h|ed for the truth; who&s;e words are the&s;e. In the year 1607. being at <HI>Ruan</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and meeting with <HI>Mon&s;ieur Figureus,</HI> that ancient and famous di|vine, and then Pa&s;tor of the Reformed Church in that city, he had from him this following relation. After the clo&s;e of the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> in the time of <HI>Pius</HI> the V. there was a con&s;ultation in <HI>Italy,</HI> by the Pope and Cardinals, for an utter extirpation of the Refor|med Churches in <HI>Europe:</HI> and to this end every Prince, of the Romi&s;h Religion, had a certain part a&s;&s;igned where this great project &s;hould be put in practice: The death of <HI>Pius</HI> the V. hindred a pre&s;ent pro&s;ecuting of this de&s;ign. And his &s;ucce&s;&s;or <HI>Gregorins</HI> XIII. did &s;uffer it to lie dead, having no heart that way; and &s;o until that time of <HI>Clemens</HI> VIII. it was not revived; but then this bloody re&s;olution was of new ratified by him and his Cardinals, under their hands and &s;eals. The only difficulty was in this, to find a fit and tru&s;ty per&s;on, whom they &s;hould make u&s;e of to the Princes of the <HI>Romi&s;h&punc;</HI> Religion, for engaging them to &s;ub&s;cribe the &s;aid ordinance, and &s;et about the exe|cution thereof.

Religion. But this grief in his countenance and car|riage put his friends, who ob&s;erved the &s;ame, to &s;trange tho'ts; and &s;o much the more, that he did expre&s;ly declare to &s;ome of tho&s;e who a&s;ked thereabout, that what to them &s;eemed a cau&s;e of rejoicing, was to him a ju&s;t occa&s;ion of grief. Yet at la&s;t finding his haz|zard, upon a bitter challenge from the fore&s;aid Cardi|nal who had heard thereof, he judged it his wi&s;dom to di&s;&s;emble: &s;hewing him, his un&s;uitablene&s;s to &s;o great an employment could not but be ground of trouble and fear; and &s;o was &s;omeway forced to engage, getting his commi&s;&s;ions, the decree of the Conclave, with letters to the fore&s;aid Princes, &s;eal|ed and &s;ub&s;cribed. But lo! whil&s;t this poor Gen|tleman is on his journey, having found ways to free him&s;elf of his &s;ervants and other company, his &s;pirit was in great perplexity betwixt the&s;e two grievous temptations, either to be in&s;trument of utter ruin to the truth and Churches of Chri&s;t, or to for&s;ake his country, inheritance and all he had in the World. Upon which he re&s;olved to retire him&s;elf out of the high way to an ob&s;cure village, where for three days he gave him&s;elf to fa&s;ting and prayer for direction and re&s;olution from the Lord: and after this had his heart &s;o &s;trengthned again&s;t the care of his worldly e&s;tate, that he re&s;olved to for&s;ake all, and to reveal this bloody con&s;piracy to the Chur|ches of Chri&s;t, and ca&s;t him&s;elf on God's hand for his future &s;tate. So that he turned his face from <HI>Spain,</HI> and took journey to <HI>France,</HI> and to <HI>Paris,</HI> where at that time remained the &s;i&s;ter of <HI>Henry</HI> the IV. a Re|ligious Prince&s;s, afterwards Dutche&s;s of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> to whom the fore&s;aid Mon&s;ieur <HI>Figureus</HI> was her prea|cher: and unto him he made his addre&s;s (tho' after divers refu&s;als of admi&s;&s;ion upon &s;u&s;picion) &s;hewing him the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, and delivered the &s;ealed decree, with his letters of commi&s;&s;ion for that effect; and

very time, whil&s;t the <HI>King's Commi&s;&s;ioner</HI> did ri&s;e from the throne to ratify this woful act, by the touch of the Scepter, even in this moment of that rati|fication, the God of Heaven &s;ent extraordi|nary <HI>lightnings,</HI> with very unu&s;ual great claps of <HI>thunder,</HI> and the&s;e followed with a mo&s;t &s;trange and extraordinary <HI>darkne&s;s,</HI> which both for the &s;ud|denne&s;s and greatne&s;s of the &s;ame did a&s;toni&s;h and affright all who were pre&s;ent; and after all &s;o vio|lent a downpouring of <HI>rain,</HI> as made the &s;treets to run like a river, impri&s;oning the Lords within that hou&s;e for an hour and an half.

To come &s;o low, down, even his word and te&s;timony who &s;peaks from Heaven, that therewith it hath a &s;olemn appeal to men's <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> and <HI>feeling</HI> about its certainty. (2.)

great was this in their eyes. Now to this, I mu&s;t further point at two or three things, which &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, may &s;eem a &s;trange contradiction to rea|&s;on. (1.) how men can find a pillow to re&s;t on, who certainly know, <HI>their breath</HI> (for the&s;e few hours in in the night) <HI>is not made &s;ure;</HI> but if by a &s;udden arre&s;t of death it &s;hould be &s;topt, which is no &s;trange thing in the World, they know not what is next; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t every night, &s;leep at an adventure of being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the next day in an irrecoverably lo&s;t e&s;tate!

How &s;trange it is, that the <HI>&s;up|po&s;al</HI> of the <HI>truth</HI> and certainty of the Scripture, that &s;uch a thing <HI>may</HI> be, does not more alarm men, and mar their quiet; or that they can &s;o much as think of an <HI>eternal</HI> e&s;tate without trembling, whil&s;t they are at no &s;olid determination in &s;uch a matter: yea, when the Scripture of God does not only witne&s;s a <HI>Heaven</HI> and Immortality, but &s;hews the World, there is &s;uch a thing as the <HI>fir&s;t fruits</HI> and earne&s;t of it; whereof men here may be fully a&s;&s;ured.

<P><HI>Inference</HI> II. Which from the Scripture's accom|pli&s;hment is clear, is this, <HI>that there is a &s;pecial debt on each Chri&s;tian,</HI> on who&s;e &s;oul the truth and faithfulne&s;s of God is &s;ealed, <HI>to give in his &s;eal there|to, and bear witne&s;s, that God is true.</HI> Thus is there a mutual &s;ealing; which is undeniably clear you &s;ee (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 22.) the <HI>Lord's</HI> putting to his &s;eal, which by all his people is well known: and have you not al&s;o (<HI>John</HI> 3. 33.) the <HI>Chri&s;tian's</HI> &s;eal and witne&s;s mo&s;t expre&s;ly held out and call'd for? This is indeed a duty, in which (we may &s;ay) the mean|e&s;t of the Saints bears his part, who hath that <HI>witne&s;s within him&s;elf,</HI> whereby he knows the cer|tainty of the words of truth: which is a great thing, that &s;uch on &s;olid ground can &s;ay, He does not more clearly &s;ee the truth, written <HI>in the Bible</HI> before him, than he knows and can read but by an other charac|ter and engravening) this written <HI>within him;</HI> though none el&s;e can read the &s;ame, <HI>but he who hath it.</HI> I know, there is a debt to the lea&s;t <HI>Scripture-truth,</HI> which tho&s;e who profe&s;s the &s;ame, do owe, when a witne&s;s and confe&s;&s;ion is call'd for, and hath thus &s;pe|cial acce&s;s, in a &s;uffering time, to &s;et to his &s;eal by a clo&s;e adherence thereto. But we mu&s;t &s;ay, this is &s;omething el&s;e, that concerns the <HI>confirmed Chri|&s;tian,</HI> as a peculiar debt he ows to the truth and faith|fulne&s;s of his God (which <HI>his &s;oul knows right well,</HI> and hath had oft confirmed) to <HI>give unto him the glory of his faithfulne&s;s:</HI> We find <HI>David</HI> (<HI>P&s;alm</HI> 89. 1.) thus &s;peaking, as one pre&s;&s;ed upon &s;uch a duty. And though &s;ome have a more &s;pecial call and greater ad|vantage to this than others; yet we may &s;ay, the confirming and &s;ealing of the truth is like a great
<PB N="474" REF="005185_0509_1016DEBEB80D80A8">
and publick trea&s;ure, wherein the meane&s;t Chri&s;tian wants not acce&s;s to ca&s;t in his mite. Now for further clearing this, what the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>'s <HI>&s;eal</HI> and <HI>atte&s;ta|tion of the truth</HI> means, and what acce&s;s or advan|tage he hath for <HI>acquitting</HI> him&s;elf of &s;uch a <HI>debt,</HI> I would point a little at, in the&s;e few particulars.&mdash;(1.) It is clear, that he who <HI>believes,</HI> and <HI>receives the te&s;timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> does thus &s;et to his <HI>&s;eal,</HI> that he is <HI>true,</HI> and &s;ub&s;cribes (as it were) the truth and doctrine of the Go&s;pel. <HI>John</HI> 3. 33.&mdash;(2.) It is al&s;o clear, the &s;hewing forth of the <HI>power of godline&s;s,</HI> and the <HI>virtues of him who hath called him,</HI> is through the tract of a Chri&s;tian's life, a li|ving and vi&s;ible witne&s;s thereto.&mdash;(3.) We may judge, the converted man upon that new and marvellous di&s;covery, he hath got of the truth, upon his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> entering into a <HI>Chri&s;tian &s;tate,</HI> when he hath pa&s;t that great &s;tep, and is as one come into another World, hath <HI>then</HI> a &s;pecial call, and advantage for &s;uch a duty, that if it were a&s;ked, <HI>What is the</HI> fir&s;t <HI>&s;ervice &s;uch owes to the truth?</HI> Is it not even this, to <HI>commend</HI> by his &s;eal and te&s;timony to <HI>others,</HI> what <HI>God</HI> hath &s;o marvellou&s;ly <HI>commended to his &s;oul?</HI> And thus needs not want acce&s;s to let the World know, who may wonder at &s;uch a change, that <HI>though once he was blind, he does now &s;ee;</HI> and a&s;&s;uredly knows, the truth is the <HI>power of God to &s;alvation,</HI> which he no more believes upon the report and te&s;timony of others, &s;ince now he &s;ees it with his own eyes. He then is to an&s;wer that call, <HI>Luk.</HI> 22. <HI>When you are converted, &s;trengthen your brethren,</HI>&mdash;(4.) When a Chri|&s;tian is confirmed, upon &s;ome remarkable <HI>faint</HI> and <HI>&s;taggering,</HI> and hath got a <HI>new &s;eal</HI> of the faithfulne&s;s of God, is he not under &s;ome <HI>new debt,</HI> to re&s;tore with advantage what he had taken from the credit of the truth, and give that good report and witne&s;s thereto, which may obviate any reflection he might

have cau&s;ed by his faint? Sure it is, the Chri&s;tian's te&s;timony hath then this &s;pecial advantage, <HI>to confirm others in the way of the Lord,</HI> that his for|mer fears and &s;hakings have been &s;o di&s;cernable. Thus we &s;ee, <HI>Hezekiah</HI> after &s;uch a remarkable plunge and fainting, comes in with his witne&s;s, <HI>I&s;ai,</HI> 38. 15. <HI>What &s;hall I &s;ay?

How concerned was he in &s;uch a duty, <HI>I &s;aid I am ca&s;t out of thy &s;ight; Yet thou hear|de&s;t the voice of my &s;upplication.</HI>&mdash;(5.) When we &s;ee <HI>Athei&s;m</HI> much <HI>abound,</HI> and hath a <HI>publick</HI> appea|rance, when it is not a <HI>particular</HI> truth, but the truth and faithfulne&s;s of <HI>God</HI> is challedged, we may judge, it <HI>then</HI> calls and calls aloud to the godly man, for his appearance, even by &s;ome more obvious <HI>te&s;timony,</HI> than at other times, to &s;o great an inter|e&s;t. Sure it is, when the lot of a Chri&s;tian is in &s;uch a time ca&s;t, and among&s;t a generation of <HI>mockers,</HI> he will not want acce&s;s and a &s;pecial call, by a chri&s;tianly grave and prudent witne&s;s, to own the truth, as that which he is obliged to &s;eal, though there were none el&s;e; yea, we may think, this &s;hould be a call and incitement, where zeal for Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath got a command over his &s;oul, as might bur&s;t his tongue-&s;trings, which before were tyed, when the <HI>faithfulne&s;s of his God,</HI> which he &s;o oft hath pro|ved, is by men brought in que&s;tion: which to <HI>David</HI> was like a <HI>&s;word</HI> that thur&s;t him through, and he could not bear it when they &s;aid unto him, <HI>Where is your God?</HI>&mdash;(6.) Upon the <HI>clo&s;e</HI> of &s;ome &s;harp and remarkable <HI>trial,</HI> when the Chri&s;tian af|ter a &s;torm comes &s;afe to land, &s;uch a <HI>new di&s;co|very</HI> he hath of the truth and faithfulne&s;s of God, lays then a <HI>new debt</HI> on him, to bear witne&s;s there|to.

I hope, this debt in a large mea&s;ure &s;hall be yet found on many of <HI>this Genera|ration,</HI> when this &s;torm is over, to pre&s;s their &s;pirits for bearing &s;uch a <HI>te&s;timony,</HI> that they <HI>thir&s;ted not</HI> when he <HI>led them through the de&s;erts;</HI> But have oft there been <HI>&s;urpri&s;ed</HI> with his <HI>immediate help,</HI> to a&s;to|ni&s;hment. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 48. 21.&mdash;(7.) Is not the experience of a Chri&s;tian and tho&s;e grave remarks he hath of the faithfulne&s;s of God, a &s;pecial <HI>tru&s;t</HI> put into his hand, and a piece of <HI>his talent,</HI> that calls for his &s;eal, as a <HI>rent</HI> which &s;uch owe to the truth; and &s;hould have &s;ome further reach, than his own per&s;onal e&s;ta|bli&s;hment? I mu&s;t &s;ay as to this, none of the &s;aints want their peculiar engagements, which they may judge are upon them, even beyond others; yea, &s;uch &s;ingular confirmations they have had of the way of the Lord, and oft with tho&s;e a&s;to|ni&s;hing circum&s;tances, that to &s;mother the &s;ame, with|out &s;ome gain and advantage thence paid in to the truth, might be reckon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tealth from the genera|tion.

From the Scriptures accompli&s;h|ment, is this, that <HI>as there is a per&s;onal debt on the Chri&s;tian, there is a publick debt al&s;o on the Church, and a &s;pecial tru&s;t repo&s;ed on every age thereof, to</HI> &s;eal the truth, and deliver that great intere&s;t off its hand, to the ages to come, with a witne&s;s to the <HI>faithfulne&s;s of God.</HI> The Scripture herein is clear; yea, we have it in an expre&s;s prophe&s;ie held forth (<HI>P&s;alm</HI> 145. 4, 5, 6.) that <HI>one generation,</HI> in a continued &s;eries, &s;hould &s;eal the truth <HI>to another,</HI> and thus carry forward a witne&s;s to the &s;ame. For each time hath &s;ome peculiar rent, which it &s;hould pay to the po&s;terity, from a new addition of the great and remarkable works of the Lord: and it is &s;ure, the greater things he hath witne&s;&s;ed, by his more emi|nent appearance for the Church, in one age beyond another, do add to this debt, and put &s;ome fur|ther engagements upon it, to <HI>record</HI> and <HI>tran&s;mit the works of the Lord</HI> and <HI>the memory of his goodne&s;s</HI> to after-times. Now with re&s;pect to this weighty truth, I would offer a few particulars (which this day, we may &s;adly regret, are &s;o much wanting) wherein &s;ome
<PB N="480" REF="005185_0515_1016DEC5B25669E0">
thing of this debt, that one age of the Church owes to another, in behalf of the truth, may appear.</P>
<P N="1">1. It may be judged a <HI>debt</HI> on the Church to po&s;|terity, to pur&s;ue that great intere&s;t of the <HI>truth,</HI> by an <HI>adding</HI> further, for confirming of the faith of the &s;aints therein, from that di&s;covery and peculiar advantages the <HI>pre&s;ent time</HI> affords: &amp; thus effectually endeavour to advance the repute and credit of the truth, on &s;olid demon&s;trative grounds of its certainty. This hath the greater call, when it is &s;o much the work of the time and of not a few labouring therein, to <HI>&s;hake</HI> &amp; <HI>un&s;ettle</HI> men, as to this great foundation; yea, &s;o much <HI>writ|ten,</HI> that hath a vi&s;ible tendency to this end. One thing particularly &s;hould be wi&s;hed, that the <HI>publick records</HI> of every age, as they concern the <HI>Church,</HI> did carry therewith more clearly &s;ome hi&s;tory of the <HI>veri|fication of the truth,</HI> by tran&s;mitting tho&s;e great &amp; con|&s;picuous remarks of the <HI>way of God with the Church,</HI> to po&s;terity; by which the <HI>Scripture</HI> then hath been &s;ignally confirmed: thus &s;hould one age declare its faithfulne&s;s to the next, which were a choice piece of &s;ervice, being gravely and with caution ma|naged.</P>
<P N="2">2. This <HI>debt</HI> does the Church owe to po&s;teri|ty, with re&s;pect to the <HI>truth,</HI> to endeavour its tran&s;|mitting <HI>purely, and without hurt and prejudice.</HI> For it is to the Church, <HI>the Oracles of God</HI> are com|mitted; &amp; for that great tru&s;t, mu&s;t &s;he in every time be re&s;pon&s;ible. But as to this, I mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>that article</HI> of the truth of God, which is more <HI>&s;harply a&s;&s;aulted,</HI> and hath endured <HI>greate&s;t oppo&s;ition</HI> from the adver&s;e party, makes this debt the greater, to deliver <HI>that</HI> off her hand, with all <HI>care</HI> and circum&s;pection, yea, with &s;ome peculiar te&s;timony thereto. It is true, there want not in every age &s;ome to appear upon the truth's intere&s;t; yea, it is a duty lies at each Chri&s;tian's door, when called to give a confe&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame: but as
<PB N="481" REF="005185_0516_1016DF0ACFE1FE88">
no private appearance can an&s;wer to a publick re|cord and monument, it is thence clear, that in a time of great incroachment on the truth, when a remarka|ble breach is like to be made, and the a&s;&s;ault not from a private adver&s;ary, but a publick formidable <HI>com|bination</HI> of a party, &s;ome more &s;olemn authorita|tive and united <HI>concurrence</HI> is then called for, in the <HI>Church's te&s;timony,</HI> for her exoneration; that with &s;uch an advantage may witne&s;s to the ages to come, whereat their fathers left, how they held out, and wre&s;tled to keep their ground, in defence of the go&s;|pel. This, we may &s;ay, is like the ca&s;ting up of a <HI>Bank</HI> to guard again&s;t a further breach, <HI>when the enemy comes in like a flood:</HI> and it is known, the <HI>confe&s;&s;i|ons of the Church</HI> in every age, with &s;uch a publick te&s;timony to the truth, whil&s;t followed with vi&s;i|ble hazard and &s;uffering, have been more effectually &s;ub&s;ervient to the truth's con&s;ervation, than all the <HI>di&s;putes</HI> of men. Thus did they <HI>overcome</HI> (Rev. 12. 7.) <HI>by the blood of the lamb, and the word of their te&s;|timony.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. This &s;pecial <HI>debt</HI> al&s;o is upon the Church, with a re&s;pect to po&s;terity, <HI>to contend for the truth once delivered to the Saints,</HI> and but once, &s;ince it can admit no change or alteration to the &s;econd com|ing of the Lord. O how ble&s;&s;ed a debate and &s;trife this is, though in &s;uch an intere&s;t <HI>re&s;i&s;ting unto blood</HI> &s;hould be called for! But whil&s;t I mention this duty, it cannot be under&s;tood with re&s;pect to that great intere&s;t of Religion only, or <HI>the weightier mat|ters of the Law,</HI> that are more fundamental, whil&s;t under a profe&s;&s;ed <HI>zeal</HI> to the&s;e, a <HI>latitude</HI> and indiffe|rency in <HI>other</HI> concernments of the truth is &s;helter|ed. It is indeed &s;trange; though no &s;trange thing in this time. But let me a&s;k, can a piece of truth held forth in the <HI>Scripture,</HI> be of that low value, to warrant the quitting or yielding up of it if
<PB N="482" REF="005185_0517_1016DEC86B45C628">
brought in debate; when <HI>one line</HI> of this is of more ine&s;timable worth, than the crowns and &s;cepters of all the Monarchs of the earth? Sure it is, <HI>the God of truth</HI> hath prized it at another rate; who declares <HI>Heaven and earth &s;hould rather fall, ere one tittle of his word peri&s;h.</HI> And can tho&s;e, in <HI>greater</HI> things be faith|ful, who are not thus in a <HI>little?</HI> It is too clearly &s;een, how &s;mall a yielding makes a great breach. Truths comparatively &s;mall may be great in their <HI>&s;ea&s;on,</HI> when they are the <HI>word of his patience;</HI> yea, we may &s;ay, the le&s;&s;er it &s;eems, and of mean value with many, it makes the Chri&s;tian's adherence there|to a greater te&s;timony. It is clear, what a clo&s;e <HI>con|catenation</HI> there is among&s;t the truths of God, held forth in the Scripture; that <HI>one part</HI> thereof cannot be &s;truck at, without a &s;pecial prejudice to the <HI>whole:</HI> yea, it may be &s;aid, every corruption of the truth hath an aim at the very <HI>&s;oul</HI> of Religion, by a di|rect tendency thereto.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is a great duty the Church owes the po&s;te|rity, for which this day there &s;eems a more than or|dinary call, to &s;tudy the tran&s;mitting of truth and god|line&s;s, <HI>not in a naked form only,</HI> but <HI>in the life and power thereof.</HI> Sure it is now too obvious, which gives ground both for grief and a&s;toni&s;hment, that through a large part of the reformed Church, and in tho&s;e places where &s;ometime the truth hath brightly &s;hined, with much &s;tate and warmne&s;s; yea, where religion in its purity is yet profe&s;&s;edly counte|nanced, and the wor&s;hip of God owned, even there we may &s;ee the <HI>power</HI> and &s;pirituality of this is a <HI>&s;trange</HI> and unknown thing: that by many within the Church and of &s;ome repute therein, it might be que&s;tioned, <HI>Is there indeed a Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and an <HI>inward</HI> teaching of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which by its working and efficacious influences is known upon the &s;oul? Or, is there &s;uch a thing as real <HI>fellow&s;hip</HI> and con|ver&s;e
<PB N="483" REF="005185_0518_1016DF0D5C1FF768">
with <HI>God,</HI> in the &s;ecret and the more publick du|ties of a Chri&s;tian, that is a&s;&s;uredly found? Oh what cau&s;e is there to fear, the &s;hadow &amp; <HI>form</HI> will be quickly gone, when the <HI>power</HI> thereof is &s;o great a my&s;te|ry! I know, it is a &s;ore challenge, and may &s;eem &s;trange to &s;ome. I do here profe&s;s, it is not to reflect on any place, or particular Church, more than another. But we may &s;ay, this want and decay is too great and univer&s;al to be hid; and now the tide &s;eems &s;o far &s;pent and go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e back, yea to a &s;mall appearance of its return, and the Church of Chri&s;t at that pa&s;s, that if the <HI>faithful|ne&s;s of God</HI> were not &s;urety, which &s;tands good for all, we might upon ordinary appearance judge, nothing el&s;e is left, but now <HI>To your tents every man!</HI> that each one &s;hould &s;hift for him&s;elf, and give over the Church. But &s;ure I am (I ble&s;s the Lord, without debate in this matter) upon a better warrant than ap|pearance, our &s;afety is this day to keep by the ve&s;&s;el, and not part intere&s;ts with an afflicted and almo&s;t &s;inking Church; a <HI>publick Spirit</HI> may yet be found the choice&s;t way to &s;ecure a <HI>private intere&s;t.</HI> Oh what do we &s;ee! Is not almo&s;t every where <HI>men's hands upon their loins;</HI> and &s;o little inquiry in that ex|treme exigence, what point of duty can yet be e&s;&s;ay|ed, to get <HI>religion</HI> up again, which now is at &s;o &s;ore a back&s;et! We might hope, a great outcoming &s;hould be, where little is expected, even upon a &s;mall &s;tirring of duty. Some things, I am &s;ure, are to be <HI>wi&s;hed,</HI> that would be of &s;ingular u&s;e to promote this intere&s;t: which I &s;hall very briefly point at.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It &s;hould be wi&s;hed, this great mean of <HI>Prayer,</HI> yet left to the Church, were with more <HI>&s;inglene&s;s</HI> and <HI>fervency</HI> improved, both by the Chri&s;tian alone, and in conver&s;e with others. This is well known, in the mo&s;t dark and di&s;mal times of her condition, what marvellous help it hath brought at an
<PB N="484" REF="005185_0519_1016DECC115397B8">
extremity, when it hath &s;eem'd in &s;ome manner <HI>ultimus conatus eccle&s;iae,</HI> and all other things gone. O a <HI>&s;pirit of prayer,</HI> what advantage hath remarkably followed upon this, to fetch the wind, yea, to get the ve&s;&s;el as it were put on float, when it hath been a low ebb with the Church! To ha&s;ten her delivery, and in the mean time keep her wounds bleeding before the Lord! We may &s;ay, thus hath the meane&s;t of the Saints acce&s;s to do a great piece of &s;ervice, even to the Church univer&s;al, and the recovery again of the pow|er of Godline&s;s, that is now &s;o far gone.</P>
<P N="2">2. With re&s;pect to this, it is to be wi&s;hed, that a greater <HI>Corre&s;pondence</HI> through the <HI>reformed Church</HI> were more effectually pur&s;ued; to know others ca&s;e, what eminent hazzard appears to the truth, or &s;ore trial and a&s;&s;ault that &s;ome particular Church may have beyond others; for witne&s;&s;ing mutual &s;ympathy; for communication of coun&s;els; the obviating prejudices and mi&s;takes; a grave incitement and up&s;tirring of o|thers, to the duty of the time; and thus a further concurrence endeavoured, in promoting the great intere&s;t of the go&s;pel. Oh &s;ad, that &s;ince the refor|mation brake up, &s;o little of this hath been practi&s;|ed! but now much more gone, that except by ordi|nary <HI>travellers,</HI> or &s;ometime publick <HI>Gazzets,</HI> the great concernments of the neighbouring Churches, and the more remarkable occurrents of providence therein, are but little known. I &s;hould account it <HI>a token for good,</HI> if &s;omething of a publick Spirit, with re&s;pect to &s;uch a mean, did more appear. We know not what advantage might follow this e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P N="3">3. This &s;hould be wi&s;hed, and might be a nota|ble and u&s;eful help, yea, of no great difficulty (now while&s;t there is &s;uch plodding in Religion, by airy notions, as if that great intere&s;t were the e&s;&s;ay of men's wit and invention) to &s;tudy the tran&s;lating of &s;ome of our choi&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pieces, in <HI>other languages,</HI>
<PB N="485" REF="005185_0520_1016DF0F19EE59F8">
which do mo&s;t nervou&s;ly hold forth the <HI>truth of godline&s;s,</HI> both in its &s;implicity, and in the life and power thereof. Such as are mo&s;t fit to put men on an other &s;cent, for bringing the naked &s;peculation of truth down to that more near feeling, and ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;oul-conver&s;e therewith; yea, &s;uch as with greate&s;t clearne&s;s might &s;hew the world &s;omething of the ine&s;timable advantage of that excellent &s;tudy, how well godline&s;s &s;uits, and is a &s;ingular help in every calling and condition of men, to make their way ea&s;y and plea&s;ant, amid&s;t the plunges of their life: but e&s;pecially, that may hold forth the indi&s;pen&s;able ne|ce&s;&s;ity thereof. It is &s;ad to think in what a mea&s;ure excellent holine&s;s is wounded, and darkned by &s;o great a cloud of prejudice, almo&s;t through the reform|ed Church, which is much pretended, upon the extravagance and un&s;uitable practice of many profe&s;|&s;ing the &s;ame, and yet &s;o little care to obviate and pre|vent this.</P>
<P N="4">4. I mu&s;t further add what, I am &s;ure, is to be wi&s;hed, when &s;o &s;mall ground &s;eems of hope therein, and calls now for much prayer, to &s;ee a <HI>&s;piritual</HI> and <HI>faithful Mini&s;try,</HI> given to the Church; of whom it might be &s;aid; <HI>the&s;e are the Amba&s;&s;adours of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> with their Ma&s;ter's authority impre&s;&s;ed on them; who in earne&s;t do <HI>travel in birth, to have Chri&s;t formed</HI> in their hearers, and preach with a feeling of that they &s;peak, to them&s;elves, as well as others; &s;uch who truly <HI>watch for men's &s;ouls,</HI> with an awful impre&s;&s;ion of that, le&s;t <HI>their blood be required at their hands.</HI> How great a ble&s;&s;ing &s;hould this be to a decayed Church, and what a ground of hope were it of a recovery! For its &s;een and clearly witne&s;&s;ed, that connexion which is betwixt the Church's ca&s;e, and the mini&s;try thereof. Was it not &s;een at the breaking out of the Go&s;pel, and the marvellous &s;ucce&s;s it had in the beginning of the re|formation
<PB N="486" REF="005185_0521_1016DECED7FAFA20">
after that long darkne&s;s under Antichri&s;t's reign, how choice and excellent a mini&s;try was then &s;ent forth; yea, what a remarkable con&s;tellation of great lights did appear, who did both burn and &s;hine in their time. Oh! The&s;e are gone; and but a few (comparatively with that time) of &s;uch a &s;pirit now to be found: but this &s;ad remark we cannot &s;hun, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">at the <HI>greate&s;t plague</HI> the chri&s;tian world and much of the reformed Church this day is under, is from the <HI>watchman;</HI> by whom the truth, in its power, hath been more <HI>wounded,</HI> than its mo&s;t pro|fe&s;&s;ed adver&s;aries. I know, there wants not &s;uch a <HI>hor|rid party</HI> in this time, who take advantage to reflect on and decry that excellent office and appointment of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for his Church, becau&s;e of the <HI>abu&s;e</HI> thereof; whom I dare not, from the aw of God, an|&s;wer in their dialect, which is only <HI>railing,</HI> and is all their &s;trength: but <HI>the Lord rebuke that evil &s;pirit,</HI> now abroad in the world! Whil&s;t I &s;peak to that great advantage, the Church and the power of religion hath by a faithful min&s;try, I mu&s;t further add this, as a <HI>debt</HI> the pre&s;ent generation owes to the po&s;terity, to witne&s;s a particular <HI>care</HI> and <HI>re&s;pect</HI> to &s;uch who are looking forth with &s;ome aim to this <HI>great calling;</HI> that in &s;o &s;adning a day <HI>the&s;e</HI> might be <HI>incouraged</HI> and &s;tir|red up (I mean where there is &s;ome promi&s;ing appea|rance) to follow their aim, and not faint, when difficul|ties &s;eem to grow in their way, and the &s;ickle now taken out of the hand of many faithful labourers; but e&s;pecially for their taking along with other &s;tudies that more excellent &s;tudy, <HI>&s;anctification,</HI> which is &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to make <HI>able mini&s;ters of the New Te&s;tament.</HI> Sure tho&s;e have now a &s;pecial ad|vantage to witne&s;s their love and re&s;pect to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who keep their face that way forward, when there &s;eems no other incitement, but the &s;ervice of <HI>&s;uch a Ma&s;ter!</HI> They may have a mean appearance,

and at this day conflict with many difficulties, on whom great &s;ervice may yet wait for the Church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Inference</HI> IV. <HI>It is a duty of &s;pecial u&s;e,</HI> with re|&s;pect to a right under&s;tanding and di&s;tinct conception of the fulfilling of the Scripture, <HI>to di&s;cern the times and inquire &s;eriou&s;ly thereabout:</HI> &s;ince it is clear, that in particular ages and periods of time the Scrip|ture mu&s;t take place, and the Prophecies thereof, which relate to each period of time, have their parti|cular and exact accompli&s;hment therein. It is &s;ure, this can be no matter of debate, that &s;uch a duty is called for in &s;o dark an hour upon the Church; yea, the greater the darkne&s;s grows, it &s;eems to have a more pre&s;&s;ing call; when we &s;ee the clouds ga|thering, that they are like to cover the face of the &s;kie; the Church univer&s;al &s;o &s;ore benighted, that &s;he hath almo&s;t lo&s;t her way amid&s;t the&s;e mi&s;ts, and among the multitude of the&s;e by-paths: for then it is not only incumbent on the publick watchmen, but we may &s;ay, concerns the godly every where, to be on this account <HI>&s;eers,</HI> to <HI>know the times, and what I&s;rael ought to do.</HI> Sure it is, no Chri&s;tian wants his watch-tower, where he may get up, by a near conver&s;e with <HI>God</HI> in the Scripture, and thence as from a great height con&s;ider the pre&s;ent time; yea, have a clear view of the mo&s;t &s;trange perplexing oc|currents thereof, how amid&s;t the&s;e <HI>his work</HI> about the Church keeps its way, and moves &s;till forward, without lo&s;ing of ground, and <HI>his truth</HI> does convin|cingly take place.</P>
<P>Now with re&s;pect to this I &s;hall here offer &s;ome thoughts, what in &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a duty concerns <HI>the godly,</HI> and calls for their &s;erious enquiry, for a right di&s;covery and <HI>under&s;tanding of the time;</HI> and &s;hall &s;hortly touch it in a few particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="488" REF="005185_0523_1016DED29970C588">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is of great import to know from the Scripture, <HI>what of the night</HI> it is, how far it &s;eems to be &s;pent, and now <HI>in what watch</HI> thereof the Church is fallen, as to her pre&s;ent &s;tate. For thus we might know to what period of her condition the&s;e great and remarkable things, which fall out in the World, do relate. This, I confe&s;s, Would be a perplext bu&s;ine&s;s, if the appearance of things were our guide, and wanted that ble&s;&s;ed conduct of the written word, when the Church's way &s;eems involved in &s;o &s;trange a labyrinth. One thing is &s;ure <HI>that the Lord hath founded Zion.</HI> and is now <HI>building</HI> her up: which marvellous work cannot halt, but in all ages is in a continued progre&s;s, wherein the great builder, doth lo&s;e no time. And from the Scripture the&s;e things &s;eem clear and manife&s;t,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That as the whole <HI>election</HI> mu&s;t <HI>obtain,</HI> &s;o now are there a great many of that elect Church al|ready entered into a <HI>triumphant</HI> condition, and are now got &s;afe on &s;hoar. There is this day a great and innumerable company of all Nations, Tongues and Languages, that were of old committed to the Me|diator's tru&s;t, and to be brought forth under the times of the New-Te&s;tament, who are <HI>perfected</HI> and <HI>before the throne;</HI> after whom the Go&s;pel did follow, and made many a long &s;tep to bring them in from the furthe&s;t corners of the earth.</P>
<P N="2">2. This al&s;o is clear, that the Church <HI>militant</HI> hath now <HI>pa&s;&s;ed</HI> and is <HI>gone through</HI> that long continued and mo&s;t di&s;mal <HI>trial,</HI> which under the times of the Go&s;pel and until the clo&s;e of time was to go over her head, even that &s;ore bondage from <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> and under his reign. It is true, this adver&s;ary does not cea&s;e, nor give over the quarrel: for he wants not wrath, when his power is abated; and this day we &s;ee him in a great &s;tir, to rai&s;e up that accur&s;ed intere&s;t, and &s;et it in its own place, that hath &s;o remarkably
<PB N="489" REF="005185_0524_1016DF154E34DF10">
been brought down, and begun to fall before the Go&s;|pel. But a &s;tep further of that <HI>judgment</HI> (which a&s;|&s;uredly is <HI>not &s;leeping</HI>) will end the bu&s;ine&s;s. How|ever this is now manife&s;t, that <HI>the Winter is pa&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Church's &s;pring</HI> begun, yea, in a large mea&s;ure ad|vanced; who&s;e growth and tender blo&s;&s;om the cold nor &s;torm cannot bla&s;t, but mu&s;t be &s;ub&s;er|vient thereto, and ha&s;ten the <HI>&s;ummer</HI>'s approach.</P>
<P N="3">3. Upon this inquiry, <HI>where the Church now is?</HI> and <HI>in what, or what manner of time, her pre&s;ent &s;tate &s;eems to fall?</HI> I think there are clear and convincing &s;ymptoms, by which &s;ome notable <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> in her condition may be di&s;cerned: that after many conflicts, and &s;ore wre&s;tling, &s;ince her victory begun over <HI>An|tichri&s;t,</HI> this time of the Church &s;eems to fall un|der that more <HI>remarkable a&s;&s;ault,</HI> which may be look|ed for from this adver&s;ary before the pouring out of the <HI>fifth vial</HI> on his throne and &s;eat; which, as the preludium of &s;o great a victory, may in &s;ome propor|tion thereto be more dreadful and &s;harp, for a time, than any we have &s;een. I humbly judge, the Scrip|ture points clearly at this, which &s;hews the wre&s;tling condition of the Church, and a <HI>war</HI> continued be|twixt <HI>Antichri&s;t and the Lamb,</HI> even in his falling &s;tate, (<HI>Rev.</HI> 17. 14.) until that la&s;t deci&s;ion (which is made &s;ure in the Church's favour) put him off the field; <HI>For the Lamb &s;hall overcome, and they that are on his &s;ide, who are called, &amp; cho&s;en and faithful.</HI> And &s;ince it is thus, that the Church's intere&s;t is advanced, by the renewed a&s;&s;aults of that adver&s;ary, &s;hould it be &s;trange, that the &s;everal &s;teps of her ri&s;ing have &s;ome conflict and oppo&s;ition proportioned thereto? Mu&s;t &s;he not be <HI>in pain and labour, as a woman in travel, for her bringing forth?</HI> Yea, do not the &s;harpe&s;t &s;howers both pre&s;age and ha&s;ten the delivery?

And tho' the particular time falls not under our inquiry, which the Maje&s;ty of God hath concealed from the Angels: yet is this clear, there are <HI>&s;igns</HI> given of its near <HI>approach,</HI> which in their &s;ea&s;on will be di&s;cernable, though little noticed by <HI>the world;</HI> it being in &s;uch a lethargy, and men then &s;o thronged with the cares of this life, that the&s;e grave forewarnings will not rou&s;e them up.

O what a marvellous truth is this, the &s;erious thoughts of which might give men new &s;ubject for wonder each day, <HI>that the time is ha&s;tening,</HI> when the <HI>Redeemer</HI> of the Church &s;hall <HI>appear in the clouds of heaven, in flaming fire,</HI> with an innumerable company of the <HI>Angels;</HI> &amp; now <HI>the du&s;t of the Saints</HI> hath not long to &s;leep, before they be <HI>awaked,</HI> with that un&s;peakable &s;weet and ra|vi&s;hing &s;ound of the la&s;t trumpet!

<P><HI>Second particular,</HI> which in our di&s;cerning the time calls for a &s;erious enquiry is this, <HI>what the pre|&s;ent appearance and &s;igns of the time &s;eem to point at.</HI> For the&s;e, as the pul&s;e to the body, are of &s;pecial u&s;e to give a clear di&s;covery of its temper and di&s;po&s;ition but this is a progno&s;tication, that goeth above the &s;tars and all the rules of A&s;trology, which the Scripture only can make us know. I confe&s;s, this day they &s;eem &s;ad, and every where look with a threatning a&s;pect on the Church. <HI>We &s;ee not now our &s;igns,</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>to|kens for good,</HI> which &s;ometimes have appeared: but there are pre&s;ages, if we could gravely look there|on, that might cau&s;e us with a&s;toni&s;hment to enquire, What can &s;uch things portend, and when will be the end of the&s;e wonders? Some &s;ew I &s;hall briefly point at, which concern this time; that if we be not much a&s;leep, might be very rou&s;ing, and make us regard the &s;ame

this a <HI>threatning &s;ign,</HI> which hath a very dreadful a&s;|pect on the Church, even <HI>that di&s;cernable lo&s;s and di&s;|advantage the be&s;t now &s;eem to be at in their frame,</HI> and that under a <HI>growing trial</HI> of the Church; &amp; the <HI>great di&s;temper</HI> many of the&s;e appear to be in, whil&s;t we may &s;ee much of that holy fear and tenderne&s;s, that did formerly &s;hew it &s;elf among&s;t the godly, gone; corrup|tion aloft; prejudice ea&s;ily taken; a Spirit of jealou&s;y poured out; yea, very &s;trange and unu&s;ual out-break|ings in offence and &s;candal. And oh! is there not here cau&s;e of fear, that the righteous God be on a further departure from his people, and that his judgment &s;hall yet more hotly pur&s;ue &s;uch, until he have con|&s;umed this generation? On which account if he &s;hould make us <HI>a generation of his wrath,</HI> we are called to adore and ju&s;tify the un&s;potted way of the Lord. Yet even as to this, I mu&s;t adventure with re&s;pect to &s;overeignty of <HI>grace</HI> (which is only like it&s;elf, and infinitely above our thoughts) to offer &s;ome di&s;covery, from the Scripture, of what he hath done in like ca&s;es. How marvellou&s;ly hath the gra|cious and long &s;uffering God interpo&s;ed, and at &s;uch a &s;ore extremity helped his Church? For it is clear, (1) That when the Church hath had no argument to make u&s;e of, no confidence to plead, but broken and confounded under the &s;en&s;e of horrid guilt, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ds one in him&s;elf, I&s;ai. 48. 9. <HI>For my name's &s;ake will I defer my anger,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;(2.)

We may read how &s;overeign Grace

hath thus marvellou&s;ly &s;tepped in, when the rod did not humble, and &s;miting would not do the turn. <HI>I &s;mote them, and they went on frowardly in the way of their heart, I&s;ai.</HI> 57. 17. Yet, &s;ays the Lord, I will not thus quit them, there is one cure for all, <HI>I have &s;een their ways, and will heal them.</HI> Such a di&s;covery al&s;o have we thereof, when a people's ruin is of them&s;elves, and iniquity hath brought them low. <HI>Hos.</HI> 13. 9. <HI>O I&s;rael, thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed thy &s;elf; but in me is thy help.</HI> Yea, hath not grace re&s;cued tho&s;e on whom their mercy mu&s;t be forced, and while on a hot cha&s;e in departing from God! <HI>Hos.</HI> 2. 7, 9.&mdash;(5.)

I &s;hall add, thus hath the freedom of grace (O marvellous grace!) &s;hined forth in former ages of the Church. But they &s;adly mi&s;|take its meaning, who are thus made &s;ecure, and not thereby led unto repentance.</P>
<P N="5">5. This looks like one of the <HI>&s;igns</HI> of our time, that there is a great cea&s;ing <HI>of the godly,</HI> yea the choice thereof, even by a more than u&s;ual <HI>di&s;patch:</HI> &amp; is not this a &s;ad Scripture-pre&s;age of evil coming, when &s;uch are (as it were) ha&s;tned away, that they may be <HI>hid</HI> in the grave, from a further &s;torm? Yet the&s;e things &s;eem clear al&s;o, (1.) What a remarkable con&s;umption did almo&s;t wear out the Church in the wilderne&s;s, whil&s;t even then there was a ha&s;tening of her after-enlargement; and though a &s;ore judgment yet the Church's mercy, in a greater repair of that lo&s;s, was helped forward; yea, we find <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> with many of tho&s;e who had been mo&s;t emi|nent in&s;truments in <HI>I&s;rael'</HI>s coming forth out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> taken away on a near approach of their entrie into <HI>Canaan.</HI>&mdash;(2.) It is &s;ure, &s;ome of the greate&s;t pro|mi&s;es of the Scripture, waits on the Church, when

That the next tide can bring in as many, with a marvellous increa&s;e, as the&s;e former con&s;uming &s;trokes had taken away; yea is it not &s;een, with a wearing out of the godly, and a declining of religion, in one part of the World, or of a country, where many have been called, that it doth break out remarkably in an other? And thus the Go&s;|pel recovers that intere&s;t, which it &s;eemed to have lo&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">6. Does not the <HI>pre&s;ent appearance</HI> of the time, <HI>threaten,</HI> by very unu&s;ual &s;igns and pre&s;ages, &s;ome <HI>&s;harp &s;torm</HI> to come now upon the World? which in many in&s;tances we may di&s;cern, that there is &s;ome remarkable work of <HI>judgment</HI> to be brought forth, and a great break among&s;t the nations near. (Though <HI>the earth</HI> &s;eems this day in a &s;trange mea&s;ure <HI>quiet,</HI> yea &s;o extraordinary a <HI>calm</HI> as is now through the World, may it not be a pre&s;age of &s;ome great <HI>&s;torm,</HI> which as too clear and hot a &s;un&s;hine foretels a break of the weather.) Sure it is, there is a <HI>&s;ound of great wrath</HI> and judgment, in the ears of many, who know what is to <HI>di&s;cern the times.</HI> It is well, the <HI>Scripture</HI> is near; a progno&s;tication that can an&s;wer all the ages of the Church: and it is <HI>there</HI> we &s;hould enquire, what &s;uch a <HI>&s;ign</HI> does portend? We may not <HI>wi&s;h the evil day;</HI> but on &s;uch an appearance of the time, that awful impre&s;&s;ion (<HI>Hab.</HI> 3. 16.) is called for, to be in a <HI>trembling</HI> frame, when God threatens and does thus <HI>utter his voice:</HI> yet is it clear, that from the&s;e threatning &s;igns there is a comfortable &s;ound of <HI>much good to the Church.</HI> For, (1.) We find <HI>days of vengeance</HI> on the <HI>World,</HI> held forth as nece&s;&s;ary for the accom|pli&s;hing of the Scripture, <HI>Luk.</HI> 21. 22. and made &s;ub|&s;ervient to the bringing forth &s;ome &s;pecial truth

And O what a &s;trange connexion is there? That the put|ing the earth in a flame, and overturning the nations, when the Lord, as a lion does rou&s;e him&s;elf up to the prey, &s;hould be the very ri&s;e to an accompli&s;hing of &s;ome great promi&s;es for the Church's advantage, yea, and as a preludum to the &s;ame! Yet nothing more evident to &s;uch who under&s;tand the Scripture; and by &s;uch a <HI>&s;ign</HI> does the Lord &s;peak comfortably to his peo|ple. We find a dreadful <HI>Winter-&s;torm</HI> on the World, pointed out as a <HI>&s;pring-time</HI> to the Church, and the trees <HI>putting forth their blo&s;&s;om,</HI> as <HI>Luk.</HI> 21. 25. It is clear, her deliverance may be begun, and the &s;torm then breaking, which may for a time put the Church under greater difficulties than before; yea, cau&s;e the godly to mi&s;take, and tremble at the &s;ight of their mercy, becau&s;e of tho&s;e things by which it is u&s;hered in, even when it is before their eyes. I &s;hall add no more but this, It is our great concernment, to <HI>fear him</HI> who guides all things, to whom alone the deter|mination of events doth belong; and this is the wi&s;|dom of his people, <HI>not to faint</HI> at the &s;trange appear|ance of the time or the &s;igns thereof, but to <HI>know what is called for,</HI> and thence read per&s;onal duties, from the &s;ad pre&s;ages of publick judgments, and to pur&s;ue more nearne&s;s with God, and en&s;ure a retreat under his &s;hadow until the indignation pa&s;s over. <HI>For behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to vi&s;it the in|habitants of the earth, and the earth &s;hall di&s;clo&s;e her blood, and no more cover her &s;lain.

<HI>A third particular,</HI> which concerns the godly with much circum&s;pection to notice and under&s;tand, in their <HI>di&s;cerning the time,</HI> is <HI>the peculiar &s;nares and hazards thereof.</HI> This is the Scripture character of the <HI>wi&s;e</HI> man, to <HI>di&s;cern time and judgment,</HI> it being &s;o oft verified (<HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 9. 12.) that <HI>in an evil time the children of men are en&s;nared, when it falls &s;uddenly upon them.</HI> Sure it is, there are &s;earching times, when the Chri&s;tian's way is more difficult and narrow (though each day hath its &s;nares, which in a &s;pecial way waits thereon) and then is it <HI>the wi&s;dom of the prudent, to under&s;tand his way,</HI> and know his ground, which the adver&s;ary by &s;ubtil and indi&s;cernable ap|proaches will &s;eek to draw him off; then is a quick &s;agacious di&s;cerning in the fear of the Lord called for, to have their eyes in their head, and be in a watching po&s;ture, when the net is clo&s;ely &s;pread un|der their feet. It is a &s;ad remark, too clearly verified oft times on a people profe&s;&s;ing the truth, which is &s;aid of <HI>Ephraim, Strangers have devoured their &s;trength, and they knew it not;</HI> Yea, their not di&s;cern|ing of the &s;ame proves a &s;pecial cau&s;e of their fur|ther ruin. And is it not written for the ages to come, in what a &s;ecure and &s;leeping po&s;ture <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> had his hair cut! He fir&s;t lo&s;t his di&s;cerning of &s;uch a &s;nare, ere he lo&s;t his eyes. We find <HI>David</HI> (through many of the P&s;alms) in his wre&s;tlings with God, more &s;o|licitous for the preventing the <HI>&s;nares</HI> of wicked men, and a delivery thence, than from their <HI>rage</HI> and vio|lence. There is a feeling the pul&s;e of the times, by which the pre&s;ent di&s;temper and hazard of the Church may be known, as well as of the body of man: and I mu&s;t &s;ay, this day in a &s;pecial manner calls us to this grave &s;tudy. I intend no further application, but a very &s;hort touch at &s;ome things in general, which rightly pur&s;ued in the godly man's &s;erious &s;tudy, may help to di&s;cern &s;omething of the publick &s;nares of the
<PB N="504" REF="005185_0539_1016DEE612F20578">
time, and how they get advantage in their approach, for the&s;e clo&s;ely wait their &s;ea&s;on, <HI>for in vain is the net &s;pread in the &s;ight of the bird.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is clear, <HI>each time hath its peculiar di&s;|temper</HI> and <HI>evils,</HI> that have then a &s;pecial power and prevalency therewith, the <HI>ob&s;erving</HI> of which con|cerns the godly, for their more watchful adverting to the <HI>&s;nares of that time.</HI> For then the temptation of the time goes therewith, as the pre&s;ent di&s;temper di&s;co|vers it&s;elf, whither in a hot boiling feaver, or in a dead lethargy; and follows tho&s;e evils, which are in that time mo&s;t contagious, where the current of the multitude runs, which is giving the godly the greate&s;t a&s;&s;ault, and &s;eem to be warmed under the fa|vourable a&s;pect and countenance of great men: yea, tho&s;e evils, which promi&s;e &s;ome outward advantage and &s;ecurity from trouble, when the que&s;tion is &s;tated betwixt &s;in and &s;uffering, it is there the pre&s;ent &s;nare does haunt, and there lies a &s;pecial piece of the godly man's work, to hold off and keep a di&s;tance from the lea&s;t acce&s;&s;ion thereto; yea, I may &s;ay next to the &s;alvation of their &s;oul, to be &s;olicitous all along their way, to have their garments keeped from the &s;malle&s;t &s;tain and &s;pot thereof. A touch, a &s;mall de|filement from a <HI>publick</HI> prevailing evil, being found to draw more deep on the con&s;cience, and with more difficulty do men recover and e&s;cape thence, than from many other <HI>per&s;onal</HI> infirmities.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is al&s;o clear, there is &s;ome piece of the <HI>truth of God,</HI> in each time of the Church, that is more <HI>que&s;|tioned</HI> and brought in <HI>debate,</HI> by which with greater advantage and clearne&s;s we may know where a <HI>publick &s;nare</HI> doth lie. For here is its aim directed, to en|tangle and a&s;&s;ault the godly man, where in a &s;pecial way he is called to his po&s;t, to contend for &s;uch an intere&s;t: and thus it may be &s;aid, if one keep &s;ight
<PB N="505" REF="005185_0540_1016DF2B8A730898">
well of pre&s;ent duty, he will with more facility find out the &s;cent, on which the &s;nare of the time is, how it directs its motion to darken or ca&s;t an ob&s;truction in the way of that duty.</P>
<P N="3">3. We may thus di&s;cern a <HI>prevailing &s;nare,</HI> and its getting ground, by that tendency there is in a day of trial, to <HI>que&s;tion</HI> and make new inquiry about <HI>duties</HI> which were <HI>once clear</HI> and <HI>unque&s;tionable,</HI> when their <HI>judgment was not bya&s;&s;ed</HI> from any outward incite|ments. For this &s;peaks men's finding a &s;ad invention to be rid of their <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> by <HI>extenuating</HI> pre&s;ent controver&s;ies: a de&s;ign, which (in the righteous judg|ment of the Lord) is &s;eldom &s;et on foot by any, but they too vi&s;ibly thrive therein, for their further ruin, and get an an&s;wer according to the idol of their heart. Thus <HI>Balaam,</HI> we have in divine record as a dreadful in&s;tance, who tried that way, and therein was &s;ucce&s;sful. And is it not a known remark, that a he&s;itation and <HI>faint upon the heart,</HI> from want of re&s;olution to &s;uffer for the truth, will not long want a <HI>&s;cruple in the head,</HI> to cau&s;e a debate thereabout; and then is it ea&s;y for a &s;nare to enter. O with what fear and tenderne&s;s &s;hould light be guarded; which, as the apple of the eye, may by the lea&s;t thing be hurt, but is not ea&s;ily healed! Thus is it, men do in&s;en&s;ibly wear out from under tho&s;e former Impre&s;&s;ions they had upon them of duty; and ere they are aware have their judgment by a judicial &s;troke determined in that, which was before their de&s;ire. They know little that <HI>depth of a man's heart,</HI> who are not jealous over a change on their judgment in an hour of trial, when its tendency is, to <HI>&s;pare them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. We may di&s;cern a <HI>publick &s;nare</HI> in it's approach, by that <HI>advantage the adver&s;ary gets</HI> thereby to <HI>divide the godly,</HI> and tho&s;e who appear <HI>for</HI> the truth, <HI>among&s;t them&s;elves.</HI> For then it is ea&s;y to enter by &s;uch a breach, and throw in the bait in &s;o muddy a
<PB N="506" REF="005185_0541_1016DEE9C33E5280">
water: it being too obvious, what an advantage a &s;nare hath, where jealou&s;y, with the&s;e bitter effects of pri|vate &s;trife and quarreling, turns mens eyes off the pub|lick hazard, and blunts that edge of contending for the truth, in &s;miting one an other. I do not mean but there may be a nece&s;&s;ity oft on the godly, to <HI>with|&s;tand</HI> their friends <HI>to their face,</HI> yea, the eminente&s;t in the Church, were it a <HI>Peter,</HI> (Gal. 2. 11.) when the truth is concerned; but this &s;hould be with greate&s;t caution and tenderne&s;s, to obviate a breach, or quarrel which is <HI>like the breaking in of waters,</HI> whil&s;t the watch|ing <HI>adver&s;ary</HI> waits his advantage in &s;uch a day of their halting. And it is too &s;adly known, how &s;mall a wedg, that is driven with a tendency to that end, makes way for the entry of a further &s;nare; &s;ee 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 16. what a &s;ad connexion there is betwixt a dividing time of the Church, and a further departing from the truth.

when it is fit to lay a &s;nare, and with <HI>Joah</HI> embrace them in their arms, whom they intend to <HI>&s;mite under the fifth rib.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. May not thus a <HI>&s;nare</HI> be &s;een in its <HI>approach,</HI> by that prevalence the <HI>fear of man</HI> hath over the time, and that unu&s;ual command it &s;eems to have &s;ome times over the &s;pirits of men, even tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>former zeal</HI> and <HI>re&s;olution for the truth</HI> hath in other trials with much advantage appeared? Here is indeed cau&s;e to watch; for <HI>in the fear of man there is a &s;nare (Prov.</HI> 29. 25.) which then will take advantage to pur&s;ue, when it finds men in a flying po&s;ture, and &s;hrunk &s;o far below their former appearance. We find the god|ly man hath his <HI>bre&s;t-plate:</HI> but he hath no piece of ar|mour for his <HI>back,</HI> when he turns his fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> from re&s;i&s;|ting. It's &s;ad, when the adver&s;ary is taught to follow, by our fainting: and <HI>that &s;pirit which is in the World,</HI> &s;eems to be upon the a&s;cendent, with a prevalence even over the &s;pirits of the <HI>godly;</HI> yea, tho&s;e deba&s;ed and made contemptible in their eyes, in whom the appearance of God and his authority upon them at another time would have made the hearts of their ene|mies to tremble. This is too obvious, in a humbling and judicial time of the Church, until once that hour of her trial go over.</P>
<P N="7">7. A <HI>publick &s;nare</HI> is then to be <HI>feared,</HI> and calls for a watching eye, by that <HI>&s;ucce&s;s</HI> which waits on a <HI>&s;inful cour&s;e;</HI> e&s;pecially when &s;uch a &s;hine is of any <HI>continu|ance.</HI> For then <HI>new queries</HI> will be &s;tarted, <HI>&s;trange re|ports</HI> &s;pread, with much &s;ubtil reflexion on <HI>the way of the Lord,</HI> to make the godly que&s;tion the &s;ame. <HI>The P&s;al|mi&s;t</HI> found it not ea&s;y to &s;tand before this, which put him to bring under debate his principles, and the advan|tage of his cau&s;e <HI>P&s;.</HI> 73. 13. And in &s;uch a trial doth the <HI>adver&s;ary,</HI> by &s;ome continued ob&s;ervation, know how to a&s;&s;ault the followers of the truth, and attack them at their weake&s;t: then is it the <HI>&s;candal of the

<P N="8">8.

how clear and expre&s;s a confirmation of the word even this is, which &s;hould more fix and e&s;tabli&s;h tho&s;e who love the truth. (1.) It is manife&s;t, that no error or corrupt doctrine a&s;&s;aults the Church, but is in &s;uch a manner pointed forth, yea, by &s;o expre&s;s an op|po&s;ition thereto, in the Scripture, that we may &s;ee a <HI>prophetical forewarning</HI> thereof, and of men's endea|vour to corrupt &amp; darken &s;uch a piece of the truth. It is &s;ure, the word is written and in a &s;pecial way direc|ted to every time of the Church, and to all her after-trials and a&s;&s;aults is peculiarly &s;uited, by him who knew &amp; did fore&s;ee what oppo&s;ition his truth in after-ages &s;hould meet with: and in this marvellous record men may clearly &s;ee (if there were &s;uch a &s;e|rious inquiry) that there is no poi&s;on or corruption in doctrine, which infe&s;ts the Church, but hath its pro|per antidote there provided. I mu&s;t here as to one par|ticular in&s;tance &s;ay, if I were not per&s;waded of a <HI>de|termined &s;pecies of government for the Church</HI> under the new Te&s;tament (which is clear in the Scripture holding forth its con&s;titution to be <HI>Ari&s;tocratick,</HI> with a parity among&s;t the officers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the ad|mini&s;tration of their power, and a &s;ubordination of the le&s;&s;er parts to the greater) I could not &s;hun &s;o clear a remark, of that expre&s;s <HI>prohibition</HI> of any <HI>di&s;parity</HI> and <HI>Lordly prelacy</HI> in his hou&s;e; yea, how manife&s;tly the all&s;eeing God, when he was about to found the Chri&s;tian Church, doth point in &s;uch plain terms at this, that we may there read a very direct prediction of that ruin and prejudice, it would on this account &s;u&s;tain in after-times. I &s;peak this on no particular intere&s;t, or from bitterne&s;s and prejudice at the per&s;ons of any, but have confidence to &s;ay, it is from the awe and per&s;wa&s;ion of the truth.

But though it is marvellous, it is &s;ure al&s;o, that the innumerable millions of men, who are this day upon earth, in all their various motions, are at pre|&s;ent fulfilling the <HI>determined coun&s;el of God;</HI> and their actings (what ever they de&s;ign therein) mu&s;t be con|centrick with his great end, nor out of that bounds can they po&s;&s;ibly move.&mdash;(4.) I mu&s;t atte&s;t the world, if they do not &s;ee, <HI>this way of godline&s;s,</HI> which &s;eems to day to be <HI>every where &s;poken again&s;t,</HI> to be that <HI>good</HI> and <HI>old way,</HI> in which are <HI>the foot&s;teps of the Saints</HI> to be found &s;ince the beginning; and that it is no <HI>new light</HI> now broke out in the world: but it is clear, through all ages pa&s;t there hath not wanted a conti|nued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e, who in <HI>this reproached way did &s;erve the God of their fathers;</HI> and have &s;ealed the truth, which now, from one time to another, we find &s;till delivered off their hands, to the pre&s;ent generation. And I here challenge the greate&s;t Athei&s;ts, <HI>to which of the Saints can they turn,</HI> or whom can they in&s;tance of that ble&s;&s;ed company, &s;ince there was a Church in the earth, who could never contra|dict this, or bear an other witne&s;s!&mdash;(5.) Mu&s;t you not confe&s;s, there is <HI>no &s;uch deep in the heart of man,</HI> or &s;o clo&s;e and &s;ubtil a convoy of wickedne&s;s there, which is not found out in the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and there <HI>pointed at;</HI> and that none can get them&s;elves hid, or get beyond the reach of <HI>this,</HI> in tho&s;e things which they are &s;ure the ob&s;erving world could never know: but the mo&s;t &s;ecret haunts of their &s;oul are unvailed, which from their deare&s;t friend they have conceal|ed.&mdash;(6.)

Can this demon&s;tration of the Scripture, and &s;o manife&s;t a witne&s;s thereto be denied, that whil&s;t man is a <HI>free agent</HI> in his actions, and doth therein act &s;pontaneou&s;ly, he hath notwith&s;tanding of this in his own brea&s;t both a <HI>judge,</HI> and <HI>accu&s;er;</HI> which, though within him, doth without his con&s;ent ex|erci&s;e a power over him, and &s;uch an authority which he would, yet cannot decline?&mdash;(7.) I dare atte&s;t the con&s;cience of men, who are them&s;elves <HI>&s;trangers</HI> to the way of God, if they can &s;o far &s;hut their eyes, but they mu&s;t &s;ee that <HI>&s;erious godline&s;s</HI> is a <HI>marvellous</HI> thing, and that there is &s;omething here <HI>above nature,</HI> which by its effects on others, may &s;hew a <HI>divine</HI> Spirit and power; that, wherever it comes, makes &s;o great a <HI>change,</HI> and one to <HI>exceed</HI> an other mo&s;t di&s;cernably, though of the &s;ame parts; that <HI>&s;uits</HI> and does accom|modate it &s;elf to the <HI>various</HI> conditions and employ|ments of men; it puts a &s;pecial honour on the greate&s;t Prince, and does in&s;truct the wi&s;e and prudent, yet will it lodge with the poore&s;t artificer in his &s;hop, or labour|ing man in the field! And does it not al&s;o appear, that here mu&s;t be a native motion uncon&s;trained and from <HI>inward principles,</HI> when on outward grounds there is not the lea&s;t incitement; which &s;hews it is a <HI>living</HI> thing, that hath its di&s;cernable langui&s;hing and wearing out, and its more vigorous actings, as well as any living man! It is &s;trange, the <HI>report</HI> of this is not matter of <HI>a&s;toni&s;hment;</HI> to bring men once to que&s;tion, if &s;uch an account as others give of this marvellous thing (<HI>Religion</HI>) can be true; how it is here, the Chri&s;tian's <HI>joy</HI> is &s;own by <HI>weeping,</HI> and his tears the &s;eed whence gladne&s;s of heart breaks forth; how &s;weet that <HI>re&s;t</HI> is, which is found in his <HI>work</HI> and labour; and with his <HI>&s;owing to the &s;pirit,</HI> the harve&s;t then begins, in a pre&s;ent <HI>reaping;</HI> and his laying forth him&s;elf, with a giving of the heart unto God, does enrich the giver by &s;uch a gift: yea, that here men

&s;hould <HI>differ</HI> &s;o much when <HI>alone with God</HI> and brought <HI>near</HI> him, from what they are at other times; and in tho&s;e retirements of their &s;oul, have that di&s;|covery and conception of the truth, which is not to be found in turning over the voluminous tractates of the greate&s;t writers.&mdash;(8.) If men have any &s;erious reflection, and do not &s;hut up the bible, can they &s;hun this remark thereof? How well it <HI>an&s;wers</HI> the various <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ions of time,</HI> and &s;o marvellous a <HI>variety of things,</HI> that are &s;o many ages di&s;tant from other; yea, that all along there is a <HI>gradual</HI> di&s;covery, and breaking out of the go&s;pel, in the &s;everal times of the Church; where it is ea&s;y to di&s;cern the <HI>antiquity</HI> of this excellent record, and &s;o great a <HI>di&s;tance of time</HI> betwixt the <HI>penmen</HI> thereof, yet in its compo|&s;ure is <HI>one entire piece,</HI> &s;o connex and clo&s;ely knit to|gether, that men may &s;ee the <HI>&s;ame &s;pirit</HI> in the whole, and in each part thereof, moving and carrying for|ward one great de&s;ign!&mdash;(9.) I &s;hall but further add, if <HI>Religion</HI> hath a <HI>being</HI> and <HI>reality,</HI> which men can|not lo&s;e the &s;en&s;e of, and deny, without falling &s;o far below rea&s;on, into the condition of the bea&s;ts, mu&s;t there not be a <HI>rule</HI> al&s;o? For it is ea&s;y to judge, in what a &s;trange and mon&s;trous &s;hape this would ap|pear, were it left to the <HI>choice</HI> and <HI>arbitrement of men.</HI> Now let the mo&s;t profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Athei&s;ts</HI> turn their eyes through the whole earth, and in a calm and &s;ober compo&s;ure of &s;pirit but judge, if there be any thing more <HI>ab&s;urd,</HI> and to a&s;toni&s;hment irrational, than <HI>that face</HI> and <HI>appearance,</HI> which religion hath a|mong&s;t tho&s;e where this excellent rule of the <HI>Scripture</HI> is not owned.
