<P>THE be&s;t method, in my judgment, of determining with accuracy, how far the light of nature is &s;ufficient to lead man|kind to the knowledge of the true GOD and their duty to him, is, to attend to the condition of the Heathen world: Not of the mo&s;t barba|rous and ignorant, but of the inhabitants of Greece and Rome at the periods when they were mo&s;t celebrated for learning and refinement. Even then they were gro&s;s idolators; and many of their &s;entiments and practices were &s;hocking

clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God-head, the world knew him not; but became vain in their imaginations, and their fooli&s;h heart was darkened.

[Rom. i. 20&mdash;23.]</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="023801_0005_0FC14DA5F0119E48">IT has been the method of the infinite God, both before and &s;ince the fall, to leave mankind to act out their own characters, and not to inter|po&s;e until the nece&s;&s;ity of his interpo&s;ition be|came evident. Thus it was in the ca&s;e of our fir&s;t parents: he could have prevented their apo&s;tacy, but did not. After they had &s;inned, and were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with con&s;cious guilt, he revealed to them Je&s;us Chri&s;t under the idea of the &s;eed of the woman.

Rather he has re&s;pect to the common opinion of the Greeks, who are &s;aid to <HI>&s;eek after wi&s;dom</HI>; meaning the wi&s;dom of this world. "We preach Chri&s;t crucified, &s;ays this apo&s;tle, to the Jews a &s;tumbling-block, and to the Greeks fooli&s;hne&s;s; but unto them who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Chri&s;t the power of God, and the wi&s;dom of God." [Ver&s;es 23, 24.]&mdash;This &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age accounts for Paul's u&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion. The preaching of Chri&s;t crucified was fooli&s;hne&s;s to the learned and unregenerate Greeks.</P>
<P N="2">II. WE pa&s;s to con&s;ider what kind of preach|ing it was, the apo&s;tle had re&s;pect to.</P>
<P>THERE are certain &s;entiments that the world can hear with patience and approbation: there are others to which the hearts of natural men ri&s;e in oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="10" REF="023801_0007_0FC14DCB9B9D80F8">I. Few, if any, object to <HI>moral &s;ubjects,</HI> becau&s;e it is a ju&s;t and general opinion, That all men ought to do ju&s;tly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God. Neither Jews nor Greeks would take offence at this kind of preaching; nor even men of vicious characters; unle&s;s the preacher &s;hould happen to fix on the vices of &s;ome of his friends, and cen&s;ure them with &s;everity. In that ca&s;e re&s;entment would naturally be excited, and he might expect to be charged with being too <HI>pointed</HI> or <HI>per&s;onal</HI> in the pulpit: e&s;pecially if he had previou&s;ly known on whom the reproof would fall.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch circum&s;tances what &s;hall a preacher do? Shall he cea&s;e to expo&s;e vice, becau&s;e &s;ome of his friends are vicious? God forbid! Far better will it be for him to lo&s;e the attach|ment of the be&s;t pari&s;hioner he has; and to make a &s;acrifice of his whole temporal intere&s;t, than to be unfaithful to his GOD, to his con|&s;cience and to the people of his charge.&mdash;The way for mankind to &s;ecure their feelings from injury on &s;uch occa&s;ions, is for them to be vir|tuous. But if they will violate the laws of God,
<PB N="11" REF="023801_0008_0FC14DD5DED1F038">
and injure &s;ociety by their wicked examples, they mu&s;t bear the reproach.</P>
<P>No <HI>prudent</HI> man will introduce per&s;onal mat|ters into the pulpit; nor will an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> man be afraid of commending him&s;elf to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God.&mdash;However, as moral &s;ubjects are generally approved, becau&s;e agreeable to the rea&s;on and nature of things, he has but little to fear on this head; except he &s;hould be too evangelical in his manner of treat|ing them: for the law may be handled <HI>evangeli|cally,</HI> and the go&s;pel may be preached <HI>legally.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. WE may al&s;o in&s;i&s;t freely on the <HI>chri&s;tian tempers</HI> without giving offence; becau&s;e, like moral &s;ubjects, they command re&s;pect from mankind in general; who readily acknowledge, that all men ought to be meek, patient, charita|ble, ready to forgive, &amp;c.&mdash;And it is confe&s;&s;ed, that the&s;e are very important &s;ubjects, and &s;hould frequently be brought into public view, as evidences of the truth of per&s;onal religion: for, <HI>if any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t he is none of his.</HI> [Rom. viii. 9.]</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="023801_0009_0FC14DE5716F26C0">3.

<P N="4">4. IT &s;eems to be a very popular opinion, "That articles of faith are of no great im|portance, provided a man's life be good."&mdash;If &s;o, it follows, that it was not <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> that Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould come into the world to <HI>teach</HI> and <HI>&s;ave</HI> mankind; becau&s;e, according to the above propo&s;ition, their &s;alvation might have been accompli&s;hed without it. For whether we believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t or Confucius is of no con&s;equence provided the life be good.&mdash;It a|mounts therefore to a rejection of divine reve|lation, particularly of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="023801_0010_0FC14DF26D306F88">"SOME per&s;ons, upon pretence of the &s;uffi|ciency of the light of nature, avowedly reject all revelation, as, in its very notion, incredible, and what mu&s;t be fictitious. And indeed it is certain, no revelation would have been given, had the light of nature been &s;ufficient in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, as to render one not wanting and u&s;ele&s;s. But no man, in &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;implicity of mind, can po&s;&s;ibly think it &s;o, who con&s;iders the &s;tate of religion in the heathen world, be|fore revelation, and its pre&s;ent &s;tate in tho&s;e places which have borrowed no light from it.</P>
<P>"THERE are other per&s;ons, not to be ranked with the&s;e, who &s;eem to be getting in a way of neglecting, and, as it were, overlooking revela|tion, as of &s;mall importance, provided natural religion be kept to."

The belief and practice of the&s;e things were, perhaps, much

promoted by the fir&s;t publication of chri&s;tian|ity: But whether they are believed and prac|ti&s;ed, upon the evidence and motives of na|ture or of revelation, is no great matter."</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aug. in P&s;a. 31.</NOTE> This way of con&s;idering revelation, though it is not the &s;ame with the former, yet borders near|ly upon it, and very much runs up into it: <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop BUTLER's analogy. Edit. 5th, p. 171&mdash;173.</NOTE> &mdash;that is, into dei&s;m. This I apprehend will appear by comparing the principle we oppo&s;e, with our Lord's commi&s;&s;ion to his apo&s;tles, [Mark 16.15, 16.] "Go ye into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized &s;hall be &s;aved: but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned." To which may be added the following &s;olemn pa&s;&s;age of Peter concerning Chri&s;t, delivered by him when he was filled with the Holy Gho&s;t&mdash;[Acts 4.12.] "Neither is there &s;alvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved."</P>
<P>IF we deny the truth of the&s;e &s;criptures the charge of dei&s;m is fixed on us: if we admit it,
<PB N="15" REF="023801_0012_0FC14DF55D800080">
we can no longer treat chri&s;tianity with indiffer|ence, but mu&s;t confe&s;s that it is of infinite im|portance to mankind both in its <HI>principles</HI> and <HI>practi&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>To a&s;certain what chri&s;tianity is, as taught by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, we mu&s;t &s;earch the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s of preaching</HI> mentioned in the text, the apo&s;tle explains by &s;aying, <HI>We preach Chri&s;t crucified.</HI>&mdash;[Ver. 23.] This general expre&s;|&s;ion comprehends, I &s;uppo&s;e, the various &s;ubjects of the mini&s;try of the apo&s;tles; which I proceed to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>MORE cannot rea&s;onably be expected under this head, than that the preacher &s;hould give a <HI>&s;ketch</HI> of the plan of apo&s;tolic preaching. A full di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject would fill volumes; and will employ the whole time of the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, provided they are properly attentive to the duties of their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="16" REF="023801_0013_0FC14E06014C7948">1&s;t. THE apo&s;tles in&s;i&s;ted frequently on the great principles, called, <HI>natural religion:</HI> Such as the being and attributes of God,&mdash;his creation and government of the univer&s;e&mdash;his love of vir|tue and hatred of vice&mdash;and that he will finally render to every man according to his works. The&s;e principles are fundamental to all true re|ligion; and are blended with chri&s;tianity, which "is a republication of them: and which is very material, it teaches natural religion in its genuine &s;implicity; free from tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titions with which it was totally corrupted, and under which it was in a manner lo&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>IF &s;o, natural religion owes much to chri&s;tiani|ty. Be&s;ides, it comprehends all the great prin|ciples of natural religion, and makes us acquaint|ed with the method of our redemption by Chri&s;t; concerning which the light of nature leaves us in total darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>THUS viewed chri&s;tianity may be con&s;idered as a <HI>new edition</HI> of natural religion, with <HI>additions</HI> of
<PB N="17" REF="023801_0014_0FC14E0771F0FD08">
the greate&s;t importance to the world.&mdash;Let mankind determine then, which has the prefer|ence: natural religion detached from chri&s;tian|ity; or chri&s;tianity as comprehending all the great principles of natural religion in their mo&s;t pure &s;tate; and at the &s;ame time revealing to us God's eternal purpo&s;e of mercy to &s;inners thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. THE <HI>univer&s;al corruption of the world</HI> is another part of apo&s;tolic preaching. In Rom. iii. Paul con&s;iders this &s;ubject in a mo&s;t explicit and decided manner, where he takes a compara|tive view of Jews and Gentiles. "What then? are we better than they? No, in no wi&s;e: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under &s;in." And after he had quo|ted &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages from the Old Te&s;tament in &s;upport of the affecting truth, he adds, "Now we know that what things the law &s;aith, it &s;aith to them that are under the law: that every mouth may be &s;topped, and <HI>all the world</HI> may become guilty before God.&mdash;For <HI>all have &s;inned,</HI> and have come &s;hort of the glory of God." [ver. 19&mdash;23.] And &s;o far as our reading and ob&s;erva|tion
<PB N="18" REF="023801_0015_0FC14E08F8875BF8">
extend, we find the melancholy truth exem|plified.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. THE &s;acred writers a&s;&s;ure us that all men, con&s;idered in unbelief, are in a condition of <HI>total depravity.</HI> [Gen. vi. 5.] We read, "And God &s;aw that the wickedne&s;s of man was great on the earth, and that <HI>every imagination</HI> of the thoughts of his heart was <HI>only evil continually."</HI>&mdash; Je&s;us Chri&s;t declares, "For out of the heart of man proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, fal&s;e witne&s;s, bla&s;phemies." [Matt. xv. 19.] If &s;o, the heart of man is the fountain of iniquity.&mdash;In John iii. 6. after Chri&s;t had &s;poken of the new birth to Nicodemus, he adds, "That which is born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h;" &mdash;that is, altogether &s;inful. Thus Paul u&s;es the term <HI>fle&s;h</HI> repeatedly. [Rom. vii. 5, &amp;c.&mdash;] "For they that are after the <HI>fle&s;h,"</HI> that is, influ|enced by a &s;inful nature, "do mind the things of the <HI>fle&s;h"</HI>&mdash;"So then they that are in the <HI>fle&s;h</HI> cannot plea&s;e God;" becau&s;e the <HI>carnal mind is enmity again&s;t him.</HI> This &s;hort &s;entence is re|markably de&s;criptive of the total &s;infulne&s;s of the human heart.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="023801_0016_0FC14E0A60833A18">BY this depravity in&s;pired writers do not mean, that there is any lo&s;s of the natural facul|ties of the &s;oul; the&s;e remain entire amid&s;t the ruins of the fall: man has rea&s;on, under&s;tanding, will and affections; but that he is de&s;titute of a &s;piritual ta&s;te, and under the con&s;tant influence of aver&s;ion to God.&mdash;If the &s;inner's heart was right in a moral &s;en&s;e, I can conceive of no remaining inability to love God for his own &s;ake, and to live to his glory. The e&s;&s;ence of religion is love; and the e&s;&s;ence of depravity or wickedne&s;s is enmity of heart to God. And in this awful condition the &s;inner is, as long as he remains in unregeneracy.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. IN connection with this repre&s;entation of human nature, the apo&s;tles endeavoured to awaken the attention of their hearers to the <HI>infinite danger</HI> in which they were. Often did they thunder in their ears the terrors of the law; &s;aying, "Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them [Gal. 3.10.] "If any man love not the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, let him be anathema maranatha <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cor. 16.22.] &mdash; "When the

Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking venge|ance on them that know not God, and that obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power: when he &s;hall come to be glorified in his &s;aints, and to be admired in all them that believe&mdash;in that day." [2 The&s;&s;. 1. 7&mdash;11.]</P>
<P>WE &s;ee that they con&s;idered mankind as con|&s;i&s;ting of two cla&s;&s;es, the righteous and the wick|ed; and addre&s;&s;ed them in language adapted to their re&s;pective characters. They did not preach to a promi&s;cuous a&s;&s;embly as if they were all &s;aints; but a&s;&s;ured the ungodly that they were in the gall of bitterne&s;s and the bonds of iniqui|ty; and that &s;hould they die in that condition, the wrath of God would abide upon them for ever. But if any of the people were pricked in the heart, and cried out, "Men and brethren what &s;hall we do?"&mdash;</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="21" REF="023801_0018_0FC14E168F43C2B8">5thly. THEY preached Chri&s;t to them as the <HI>end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth.</HI> "For I determined, &s;ays Paul to the Corinthians, not to know any thing among you, &s;ave Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him crucified." [1 Cor. ii. 2.] This was their darling theme, and the only re|medy for &s;in-&s;ick &s;ouls.</P>
<P>HAD a &s;ermon been delivered in the apo&s;tolic age, to a chri&s;tian a&s;&s;embly, that had but little of Chri&s;t in it, they would at once have concluded, the preacher had forgot his errand; and with the di&s;appointed woman at the &s;epulchre, have cried out, "They have taken away my Lord out of his place, and I know not where they have laid him." Where &s;hould Je&s;us Chri&s;t be as the object of affection, if not in the hearts and con|ver&s;ation of his di&s;ciples?&mdash;Where indeed, if not in the preaching of his mini&s;ters?</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tles preached Chri&s;t in his TRUE and PROPER DEITY as e&s;&s;ential to the chri&s;tian &s;cheme. This great truth they had learned from his own mouth. [John x. 31&mdash;39.]&mdash;

<P>THE language and conduct of the di&s;ci|ples of Chri&s;t prove, that they received him as a divine per&s;on. John tells us [c.v. 23.] That it is the will of God, "That all men &s;hould honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father who hath &s;ent him." Compared with Heb. i. 6. "And again when he bringeth in the fir&s;t begotten into the world, he &s;aith, And let all the angels of God wor&s;hip him." The be&s;t comment on &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages will proba|bly be found, in the conduct of his immediate followers. If they, who were favored with di|vine in&s;piration, actually wor&s;hipped him, we may &s;afely believe that they received him as very and eternal God. This then really was the ca&s;e

<P>WHAT idea would a man of common &s;en&s;e form of the character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, upon read|ing Philip. ii. 6. "Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God?" Would he not naturally think, either that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is a divine per&s;on; or that he was guilty of the mo&s;t horrid impiety? It would have been a robbery of the mo&s;t bla&s;phemous kind, for a creature, however exalted, to claim equality with JEHOVAH: and in&s;tead of his be|ing celebrated for his humility, he ought to be con&s;idered as a mon&s;ter of pride and wickedne&s;s.

Nor do we find that they ever made a &s;ingle attempt to explain, how it is that the Father, the Son and the Holy Gho&s;t are three per&s;ons yet one God; nor how the divine and human na|tures were united in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P N="8">8th. I PASS to ob&s;erve; That the apo&s;tles plainly and repeatedly preached the doctrine of <HI>divine &s;overeignty:</HI> Or, that God has an ab&s;olute right to di&s;po&s;e of all things, ac|cording to his own plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IT has often been objected to this truth, That it repre&s;ents Almighty God partial to his creatures, by making a di&s;tinction among them. &mdash;But this ought not to be an objection, becau&s;e it is a fact, known and read of all men, that he hath placed &s;ome in a far more eligible &s;ituation than others. In creation we ob&s;erve the mo&s;t palpable di&s;tinction among the creatures of God.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="023801_0044_0FC14E856A9185A0">ANGELS are fir&s;t in the order of created in|telligences; are &s;aid to excel in &s;trength, conti|nually &s;urround the throne of God, and are em|ployed in the mo&s;t exalted and important &s;ervi|ces. They are dignified in nature and office.</P>
<P>MEN form the next link in the chain of in|telligent agents; whom Deity hath created with a nature le&s;s dignified, endued with inferior mental powers, and employed in a manner le&s;s noble and intere&s;ting. Among man|kind there is al&s;o a very obvious di&s;tinction. One man is extremely hand&s;ome; another, ex|tremely homely: One has all his part; another is deformed, maimed, blind, halt.</P>
<P>THEY differ in mind likewi&s;e no le&s;s than in body. One per&s;on has great &s;agacity and pene|tration; another is an idiot, or but a &s;mall re|move from him. All minds, though formed by the &s;ame Almighty hand, are not of the &s;ame di|men&s;ions. God him&s;elf hath made this differ|ence.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="023801_0045_0FC14E922C1EF3D0">THEY differ in place or &s;tation in life. They are notfitted for, nor employed with equal dig|nity. All are u&s;eful in their place, but not equally &s;o.</P>
<P>THIS being the ca&s;e, I a&s;k, Will any man dare to cen&s;ure JEHOVAH for making &s;uch di&s;tinctions among his creatures? "Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the &s;ame lump to make one ve&s;&s;el to honor, and another to di&s;honor?"&mdash; Shall the idiot, or the man of &s;mall powers of mind &s;ay to his Creator, Why was I not made equal to Sir I&s;aac Newton?&mdash;Or &s;hall that great philo&s;opher &s;ay to his Maker, Why was not I created an angel? We tremble at the idea of thus arraigning the divine conduct. God hath done what he had a right to do; and hath exerci&s;ed that right under the influence of infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>WE ob&s;erve that the like di&s;tinction runs thro' God's whole <HI>oeconomy of providence.</HI> Some per|&s;ons have all and abound; others are depre&s;&s;ed with poverty.&mdash;Two men &s;hall &s;ee out in life with equal pro&s;pects and advantages; one of

them &s;hall be &s;ucce&s;sful in almo&s;t every thing he undertakes; the other &s;hall meet with re|peated lo&s;&s;es, and become poor.</P>
<P>SOME per&s;ons enjoy a con&s;tant and confirmed &s;tate of health; others are always &s;ick, knowing &s;carce one day in which they are free from pain; though equally virtuous and temperate.&mdash;One pa&s;&s;es through the mo&s;t eminent dangers, and e&s;capes uninjured; another lo&s;es his life by the mo&s;t trifling occurrence.&mdash;One lives to a good old age; another is cut down from the birth.&mdash; One continues till he becomes a burden to him|&s;elf and friends; another in the bloom and vi|gor of his days, is arre&s;ted by the la&s;t enemy.</P>
<P>THE Deity hath made a difference among mankind with re&s;pect to the means of knowledge. Some people remain in the &s;avage &s;tate; while others, favored with every advantage of infor|mation, both divine and human, have arrived at a &s;urprizing height of knowledge and refine|ment. Yet they all belong to the &s;ame great family, and are under the government of the &s;ame infinite God, who for wi&s;e rea&s;ons, makes

the&s;e di&s;tinctions among them. He could ea&s;ily have placed all men in circum&s;tances equally agreeable, had it been his will: or have made an entire rever&s;e of condition. He might have ordered your &s;oul or mine to have animated the body of a Laplander, a Hottentot, or an American &s;avage; but he hath been plea&s;ed, as a &s;overeign God, to place us in more plea&s;ing condition.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the di&s;tinctions which God hath made in the cour&s;e of his moral govern|ment: And who &s;hall &s;ay unto him, What doe&s;t thou?</P>
<P>THE &s;overeignty of God is equally apparent in his conduct towards <HI>&s;inners.</HI> He hath pa&s;&s;ed by the fallen angels. "And the angels which kept not their fir&s;t e&s;tate, he hath re&s;erved in everla&s;ting chains under darkne&s;s, unto the judg|ment of the great day." [Jude vi.] Their nature the Son of God did not a&s;&s;ume, becau&s;e their &s;al|vation was not the end he de&s;igned to accompli&s;h: Accordingly we are told, that hell is "prepared for the devil and his angels."

<P><PB N="52" REF="023801_0048_0FC14E9CCD427C48">GOD hath made a very important difference among mankind by &s;ending the go&s;pel to &s;ome of there and withholding it from others.

<P>BBSIDES, it is evident that there is a &s;triking analogy in all his conduct in creation, providence and redemption.&mdash;He hath not in either ca&s;e di&s;tributed his ble&s;&s;ings on all men alike.

one of a city, and two of a family and brings them to Sion. "For he &s;aith to Mo&s;es, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compa&s;&s;ion on whom I will have compa&s;&s;ion. So then it is not of him that wil|leth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that &s;heweth mercy. Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth," [Rom. ix. 15, 16, 18.] not by po&s;i|tive influence, but by leaving the &s;inner to act out his own character, or follow the wickedne&s;s of his own heart.&mdash;And as mankind univer&s;ally have by &s;in &s;ubjected them&s;elves to everla&s;ting condemnation, they that are lo&s;t will have no ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint again&s;t God; but will be obliged to acknowledge his ju&s;tice; and they who are &s;aved, will a&s;cribe their &s;alvation wholly to his &s;overeign grace. God condemns none but the guilty; nor will he &s;ave any that had any claim on him; otherwi&s;e &s;alvation would not be by grace.</P>
<P>IN the chapter in which the text is, this di&s;|tinction is mo&s;t clearly declared. The &s;ame go&s;pel that was the wi&s;dom and power of God
<PB N="54" REF="023801_0050_0FC14EA1DDA274D0">
to &s;ome, was a &s;tumbling-block and fooli&s;hne&s;s to others: hence Paul thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Corinthians; "For ye &s;ee your calling bre|thren, how that not many wi&s;e men after the fle&s;h, not many mighty, not many noble are called. But God hath cho&s;en the fooli&s;h things of the world to confound the wi&s;e; and God hath cho&s;en the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty: and ba&s;e things of the world, and things which are de&s;pi&s;ed, hath God cho&s;en, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: that no fle&s;h might glory in his pre&s;ence." [1 Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. 26, 27, 28, 29.] Remark, my brethren, God is here &s;aid to choo&s;e &s;ome and to leave others. Some per&s;ons were brought to receive the go&s;|pel, while others were left in their unbelief.</P>
<P>PAUL always a&s;cribes his conver&s;ion to the <HI>grace</HI> of God. "When it plea&s;ed God who &s;e|parated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace"&mdash;In another place he &s;ays, "By the grace of God I am what I am."&mdash;If &s;o, it follows as an undeniable truth, That God made a difference between him, and many of his coun|trymen
<PB N="55" REF="023801_0051_0FC14EAA6C948D48">
the Jews. He was converted to chri&s;tian|ity by divine power, while crowds of other &s;in|ners were pa&s;&s;ed by. God could as ea&s;ily have converted the whole nation as one man, had it been his &s;overeign plea&s;ure: but you all know he did not; therefore he made a difference.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee in our own day when the Lord revives his work among us, that one is taken and ano|ther left. The &s;ame &s;ermon that is the means of awakening or comforting one per&s;on, leaves others in a &s;ecure condition. Under the &s;ame religious advantages &s;ome are hopely wrought upon, while others maintain their oppo&s;ition to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THAT the &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel, or the con|ver&s;ion of &s;inners is owing to divine influence, is proved by the current language of &s;cripture. They who believe in Chri&s;t, are &s;aid to be "born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but <HI>of God."</HI> [John i. 12, 13.] Paul &s;ays, "I have planted, Apollos watered, but <HI>God gave the increa&s;e."</HI> [1 Cor. iii. 6.]&mdash;We may &s;afely conclude then, that under the di&s;pen|&s;ation
<PB N="56" REF="023801_0052_0FC14EABA64D34D0">
of the go&s;pel, God confers a favor on &s;ome&punc; that he does not confer on all.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Lord teaches us this doctrine of divine &s;overeignty in the following pa&s;&s;age, as well as in others that might be mentioned. [Luke x. 21.] "In that hour Je&s;us rejoiced in &s;pirit, and &s;aid, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of hea|ven and earth, that thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them unto babes; even &s;o, Father, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight."</P>
<P N="9">9th. THE <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>re|pentance</HI> were important parts of the preaching of the apo&s;tles. They a&s;&s;ure us, that "faith is, the &s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for, and the evi|dence of things not &s;een."&mdash;"The belief of the truth," or, a giving credit to the record God gave of his Son. And that we may be capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing between living and dead faith, they inform us, that the faith of God's elect, works by love, purifies the heart, e&s;teems Chri&s;t precious, and produces good works: "Faith without works is dead being alone."</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="023801_0053_0FC14EB624D14B00">THE importance of faith appears from various circum&s;tances, &s;uch as, That without it we can|not plea&s;e God&mdash;enjoy the con&s;olations of the go&s;pel, nor enter into the kingdom of heaven. "If ye believe not that I am he, &s;aid Chri&s;t to the Jews, ye &s;hall die in your &s;ins;" [John viii. 24.] that is, under the cur&s;e of the law, and peri&s;h for ever. The language of the commi&s;&s;ion needs no comment; "He that believeth &s;hall be &s;av|ed; and he that believeth not &s;hall be damned." According to this commi&s;&s;ion, the apo&s;tles con|&s;tantly urged on &s;inners the nece&s;&s;ity of believing in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom God had &s;et forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.</P>
<P>THEY al&s;o in&s;i&s;ted, wherever they went, on the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of repentance, as implying a change in the di&s;po&s;ition of the mind, without which no man can &s;ee the Lord. Peter &s;aid to the anxious multitude, [Acts ii. 37, 38,] "Re|pent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins." And Paul a&s;&s;ured the Athenians, that "God commanded all men every where to repent, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="58" REF="023801_0054_0FC14EBB0E2A1558">
he had appointed a day in which he would judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s," &amp;c.&mdash;[Acts xvii. 31.]</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t likely method of bringing mankind to repentance, is to hold up to their view the nature, extent, and perpetuity of the divine law, as holy, ju&s;t and good;&mdash;&mdash;reaching to the thoughts and intents of the heart&mdash;requiring truth in the inward parts, and condemning the &s;inner for a &s;ingle inordinate de&s;ire, or wrong temper: which law is perpetually, and univer|&s;ally binding. Until heaven and earth pa&s;s a|way, Chri&s;t a&s;&s;ures us, one jot or tittle of the law &s;hall not fail.&mdash;Now by this law is the know|ledge of &s;in; and when it comes home in its true nature on the con&s;cience, &s;in revives and the &s;inner dies, i. e. he &s;tands ju&s;tly condemned by it as a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, but &s;ees no way of e&s;cape. In this condition he remains till Chri&s;t is revealed in him: For the law can do nothing but con|demn him. It will not accept repentance as a condition of his pardon; nor can it di&s;cover the atonement. Its language is, "Pay me what thou owe&s;t." At length the &s;inner is brought
<PB N="59" REF="023801_0055_0FC14EBCDF296EA8">
to look on him whom he hath pierced, and to mourn for him as one mourneth for his only &s;on, and to be in bitterne&s;s for him, as one that is in bitterne&s;s for his fir&s;t born. He adopts the language of the prophet, &s;aying, "Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was in&s;tructed, I &s;mote upon my thigh: I was a&s;hamed, yea, even confounded, becau&s;e I did bear the reproach of my youth." [Jer. xxxi. 19&punc;]</P>
<P N="10">10th. THE apo&s;tles dwelt much on the <HI>chri&s;tian tempers,</HI> and the whole circle of <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>evan|gelical obedience</HI>; &s;uch as, &s;upreme love to God&mdash; benevolence to men&mdash;meekne&s;s, patience&mdash;re&s;ig|nation to the divine will,&mdash;forgivene&s;s of inju|ries,&mdash;readine&s;s to relieve the poor, &amp;c. Je&s;us Chri&s;t had taught them the&s;e important le&s;&s;ons in his mo&s;t excellent &s;ermon on the mount, [Matt. 5, 6 and 7 chapters] which contains an immen&s;e trea&s;ure of mo&s;t precious truths and exhortations: after which they copied in their own preaching. Hence they thus addre&s;s us, "If any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his."&mdash;"They that are Chri&s;t's have crucified the fle&s;h with its affections and lu&s;ts."&mdash;

<P>AFTER this long night of error and per&s;ecu|tion, during which period, the witne&s;&s;es were &s;ew, and were obliged to prophecy in &s;ackcloth, the reformation took place.

<P>WHENCE we infer,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel have the greate&s;t encouragement, to preach the &s;ame doctrines in every age of the world.</P>
<P>THOSE per&s;ons are quite mi&s;taken who think, that the go&s;pel can be rendered agreable to na|tural men as &s;uch: they may be changed in|to the &s;pirit of it by the power of God, but the go&s;pel remains the &s;ame. Or the preachers of it may leave out, or explain away its mo&s;t exceptionable parts, and thereby obtain the cha|racter of <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>moderate</HI> men: but let it be remembered in that ca&s;e, it is no longer Paul's go&s;pel or chri&s;tianity as taught by Chri&s;t and

<P>THE nearer we come in preaching to the &s;en|timents and manner of the apo&s;tles, I humbly conceive, the greater rea&s;on we have to expect &s;ucce&s;s. The <HI>&s;entiments</HI> have been con&s;idered; of the <HI>manner</HI> I beg leave to &s;ay&mdash;They preached <HI>plainly,</HI> that all who heard them might under&s;tand them; and <HI>faithfully,</HI> that God, their own con|&s;ciences, or the people might not reproach them. They did not &s;hun to declare the whole coun&s;el of God; nor u&s;e ambiguous expre&s;&s;ions, to pre|vent its being known what their real &s;entiments were; but took a &s;ide like faithful men; nor feared any con&s;equences, while engaged in, what they believed to be, the cau&s;e of God and truth.</P>
<P>EVERY man has an undoubted right to think for him&s;elf, and to publi&s;h his principles to the world: and in this enlightened and liberal age he has nothing to fear as to his per&s;on. And though his &s;entiments may be oppo&s;ed, his fide|lity will entitle him to re&s;pect from mankind; who continue to revere an hone&s;t man.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="023801_0066_0FC14EF0CA1C45A8">THE apo&s;tles were al&s;o <HI>diligent</HI> in the work of the Lord: were in&s;tant in &s;ea&s;on, out of &s;ea&s;on. "I have taught you publicly, &s;ays Paul, and from hou&s;e to hou&s;e." Their hearts glowed with love to God, and to the &s;ouls of men; hence they were willing to &s;pend and to be &s;pent in the &s;acred &s;ervice. In public and private life they were examples to the flock.</P>
<P>THEY preached with a <HI>pathos</HI> that aro&s;e out of the infinite importance of the &s;ubjects of their mini&s;try; which had a natural tendency to fix the attention of their hearers, and to convince them that they were in earne&s;t.&mdash;They felt their &s;ubjects, and they made others feel. Felix, a Roman governor, trembled before Paul his pri|&s;oner, while he rea&s;oned of righteou&s;ne&s;s, tem|perance, and judgment to come.&mdash;King Agrippa was forced to acknowledge, that Paul had almo&s;t per&s;uaded him to be a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="2">2. WHAT has been &s;aid, &s;ugge&s;ts to them who have been long in the mini&s;try, and have had but little &s;ucce&s;s, the &s;erious enquiry, Whether they have plainly and faithfully preached the apo&s;tolic

<P>TRUE indeed, it &s;ometimes happens, that the <HI>faithful</HI> mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are for a &s;ea&s;on un&s;ucce&s;sful; yet they ought not to be di&s;cou|raged, for in due time they &s;hall reap if they faint not. They who go forth weeping bearing precious &s;eed, &s;hall finally return rejoicing, bring|ing their &s;heaves with them.&mdash;But &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hould not &s;ee the fruit of their labors in this life, they will have the te&s;timony of con&s;cience, that in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity, not with fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, but by the grace of God, they have had their conver&s;ation in the world.&mdash;Let them who &s;ow, &s;ow in hope:&mdash;The word &s;hall not return void, but it &s;hall accompli&s;h that which God plea&s;eth, and pro&s;per in the thing whereto he &s;ent it.</P>

becau&s;e it tends to advance the glory of God, and the &s;alvation of &s;inners.
