<P>_THEY are the Words of King <HI>Solomon,</HI> and his celebrated Wi&s;dom &s;hould give them the greater weight with us.</P>
<P>'Tis ob&s;ervable, that among all the Sins and Lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, the Royal Preacher takes the mo&s;t notice of <HI>Whore|dom</HI> and <HI>Drunkenne&s;s.</HI> He begins with the Whore in my Context, and de&s;cribes her by a deep ditch, and a narrow pit, that lyeth in wait, as for a prey, and increa&s;eth the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors among Men. To this, he &s;ubjoins the words of my Text.&mdash;<HI>Look not thou upon the wine, when it is red, when it giveth his
<PB N="2" REF="003357_0003_0FF819C2C6F90CA8">colour in the cup, when it moveth it &s;elf aright.</HI>&mdash;Why not? Hath God made any thing in vain? Is not Wine ordained to cheer the heart of Man? to help his Stomach, and his often Infirmities? yes: every Creature of God is good, &s;anctified by Prayer, and receiv'd with Thank&s;giving; but it may not be abu|&s;ed, to fea&s;t our Luxury, and to quench our Drunken and Exce&s;&s;ive thir&s;t. The abu&s;e is here forbidden, the Wine wherein is Exce&s;s; where Rea&s;on is de|thron'd, and Pa&s;&s;ion become ab&s;olute; where Men have lo&s;t the command of their Appetites, and drink at irregular hours, and to an exce&s;&s;ive degree.&mdash;Then they mu&s;t not look upon it, when it is red <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But guard again&s;t it, and keep their di&s;tance.&mdash;Becau&s;e, at the la&s;t, <HI>it biteth like a Serpent, and &s;tingeth like an Adder.</HI> (i. e.) 'Tis of pernicious con&s;equence to the Drunkard.</P>

<P N="1">1. 'Tis of pernicious Con&s;equence to the <HI>Pur&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Be not among&s;t Wine-bibbers, among&s;t riotous Eaters of Fle&s;h; for the Drunkard, and the Glutton &s;hall come to Poverty.</HI> What is &s;aid of the Whore, is applicable enough to the Cup, that by Means thereof, a Man is brought to a piece of Bread. How often has this Ob&s;erva|tion been verified in our Eyes? How u&s;ual a Thing is it for Per&s;ons addicted to Liquor, to &s;et out in the World, with a good, improveable Intere&s;t, and to be reduced, by exce&s;&s;ive Drinking, to Penury and Want; to &s;ee them naked and hungry, living on their Neighbours Charity, or &s;pending their Days in Goals and Pri&s;ons: Of this we have, not one or two, but many In&s;tances.
<PB N="3" REF="003357_0004_0FF819C496F3E678">Men that have brought them&s;elves, and (which is more affecting) their innocent Families, to &s;hameful Beggary:&mdash;Nor can it morally &s;peaking, be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) When the Liquor they &s;wallow is &s;o <HI>Expen&s;ive.</HI> When their Expences run up to <HI>Hundreds,</HI> if not <HI>Thou&s;ands</HI> in the year. Men need plentiful E&s;tates, a large Fund, and great Incomes, to Ballance the Expence of &s;uperfluous Liquors, ab&s;tract from the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) As their Liquor is Expen&s;ive, &s;o their <HI>Time</HI> is Con&s;umed. When they &s;hould be at Home, then they are abroad at a Tavern, and drinking, when they &s;hould attend their Bu&s;ine&s;s and Callings; and 'tis well, if their Cups have not the larger half of their Time: 'Tis notoriou&s;ly &s;o in too many In&s;tan|ces; who Work one day, and, perhaps, Drink out two.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) They not only con&s;ume their <HI>Time,</HI> but lo&s;e their <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> for Bu&s;ine&s;s.
<P>The Drunkard daily contracts &s;lothful Habits, and a growing Aver&s;ion to his Work and Calling. He is unfit for Labour, and in his &s;obere&s;t Hours, cannot &s;o well project his Schemes, or di&s;po&s;e his Affairs.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>(4.) I might add, under the Head of Penury, how expo&s;ed he &s;tands to the <HI>Impo&s;itions</HI> of Knaves &amp; Cheats.</ITEM>

<P>How often do they take the advantage of his Cups, and &s;leeping Rea&s;on? to entice him into Contracts and Bargains that are injurious to his Intere&s;t; and &s;ometimes to &s;ub&s;cribe Papers to his ruine &amp; de&s;truct|ion? I am per&s;waded, I need not help your Me|mories here, nor Recollect for you. The&s;e &s;everal ways, among others, does the Drunkard come to Poverty. An Argument, I have the longer in&s;i&s;ted upon, becau&s;e it draws its force, from the incon&s;i&s;t|ency of the Sin, with the Riches and Profits of <HI>this</HI> World, which is mo&s;t apt to affect the Minds of &s;uch, as look not at the Things, which are un&s;een and <HI>E|ternal.</HI> Nor is Poverty the only pernicious con&s;e|quence of the Cup.

2. It &s;trikes the <HI>Reputation</HI> and <HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P>Men act below their Honour, and expo&s;e them|&s;elves in their Wine, &s;ometimes by fooli&s;h, imperti|nent Que&s;tions and An&s;wers, incon&s;i&s;tent with their &s;ober tho'ts and di&s;cretion; and &s;ometimes, by unbe|coming, if not immode&s;t Actions; as <HI>Noah</HI> drank of the Wine, and was uncovered in his Tent. When <HI>Micah</HI> &s;aw <HI>David</HI> dance before the Ark, tho' out of a religi|ous re&s;pect and gladne&s;s, &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed him in her Heart, and &s;aid &s;coffing, <HI>How glorious did the King of I&s;rael look to day, in the Eyes of his Servants &amp; Maidens!</HI> &mdash;Methinks, the Irony may more naturally, and with a more vi&s;ible Ju&s;tice, be applied to the Drunkards. How glorious do they look in the Eyes of &s;ober Men! &s;taggering over the Plains; wandring out of their Way; their Mouths full of Bitterne&s;s and Cur&s;ing, and bea&s;tly Communication; their Eyes dim and drow&s;y; their Rea&s;on drowned, and the Man a Brute, in a different Shape. If this be an honourable Stroke in a Man's Character, the Drunkard may be &s;ure of Honour enough. And next to a Man's Life and Health, and before his Intere&s;t, is his Character. A good Name is as precious Ointment, but <HI>the Drunkard,</HI> is a dead Fly, which makes it &s;tink in the No&s;trils of Fame.</P>
<P N="3">3. Drunkenne&s;s is a <HI>leading</HI> Iniquity, a capital Crime, and draws a Complication of Sins after it.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) It's direct Tendency is to all <HI>Uncleanne&s;s.</HI>
<P>The wi&s;e Man therefore connects them, and a&s;&s;igns impure De&s;ires, as the effect of the Cup. Thine Eyes &s;hall behold &s;trange Women. Rea&s;on is then depo|&s;ed, and Pa&s;&s;ion, ab&s;olute enough before, receives an Incentive from Liquor, and burns up to an impure Fire: Witne&s;s <HI>Lot</HI>'s Ince&s;t with his two Daughters, after he had drank of the Wine. The&s;e two <HI>Adepts</HI> in Wickedne&s;s, knew of no other Method, to reach their cur&s;ed Ends, but to make their Father drink Wine. I will not offend
<PB N="5" REF="003357_0006_0FF819CB517FA128">a mode&s;t Audience, in de&s;cending too much into Par|ticulars; I will only &s;ay, that Men (and why &s;hould I leave out Women?) run to &s;uch extravagant lengths of Uncleanne&s;s, in their Cups, as would make them blu&s;h, at the very mention, when their &s;ober Tho'ts and Rea&s;on return.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) It directly leads to open <HI>Prophanene&s;s.</HI>
<P>It corrupts the Language, and debauches the Tongue, which is then a Fire, &s;et on Fire of Hell and Liquor, in union. What prophane Speeches, enough to make a &s;ober Ear tremble, drop from the <HI>Drunk|ards</HI> Mouth: Language, perhaps, he was never ac|cu&s;tomed to. How are all the Bonds of Profe&s;&s;ion, and the Power of the &s;tricte&s;t Education, forgot in a <HI>Tavern.</HI> Tho&s;e that pa&s;s for <HI>Saints,</HI> and Men of Re|ligion, if captivated by the Cup, when it giveth his Colour, are as loo&s;e and prophane, as the greate&s;t Practitioners.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) It often runs into <HI>Murder</HI> it &s;elf.
<P>A thou&s;and unhappy Proofs we have of this, and &s;ome very modern. Liquor inflames the Pa&s;&s;ions; then ari&s;es Contention, Heat and Blood; then Duelling, or private Attempts, and &s;ometimes the open Act of Murder. This is often the I&s;&s;ue with Men: And how often have we known the <HI>other Sex,</HI> fir&s;t in their Cups, then prompted to Uncleanne&s;s, then to &s;tifle their Conception, or to imbrew their Hands in the Blood of their Infants? The &s;ame Per&s;ons the In&s;tru|ments of their Being and Death. The&s;e <HI>three</HI> Sins, Drunkenne&s;s leads us to, by a natural and direct Ten|dency; and in a remoter Sen&s;e, it is the Occa&s;ion of <HI>all</HI> Sin. Our Saviour exhorts us, to watch and pray, le&s;t we enter into Temptation; but a Man in Drink, is unfit for both. Therefore, when the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> would commend <HI>Vigilance,</HI> he fir&s;t exhorts to <HI>Sobriety.</HI> Be <HI>Sober,</HI> be <HI>Vigilant,</HI> for your Adver&s;ary the Devil, as a roring Lyon, walketh about, &s;eeking whom he may devour. All our Vigilance and Strength, are lit|tle
<PB N="6" REF="003357_0007_0FF819CDA6FC3980">enough to guard us again&s;t him. What mu&s;t be|come of us then, when Wine has thrown us upon our Backs, and lull'd us into a &s;piritual Lethargy! There is no Sin &s;o unnatural, but a Drunkard may commit it; tho' it be to murder his <HI>Father,</HI> and to defile his <HI>Mother.</HI></P></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="4">4. The Sin of Drunkenne&s;s wounds the <HI>Con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>What bitter Reflections follow the Cup! At the la&s;t it <HI>biteth</HI> like a Serpent, and <HI>&s;tingeth</HI> like an Adder. Nothing remains but Remor&s;e of Con&s;cience, and like <HI>John</HI>'s prophetick Book, the Wine that was &s;weet in the Mouth, becomes bitter in the Belly. Or, if the Drun|kard be without this con&s;equent Remor&s;e, when his Rea|&s;on returns, his Ca&s;e is yet wor&s;e, and more to be pitied; 'tis an awful &s;ign his Con&s;cience is &s;eared, and in&s;tead of warning, &s;hall only awake to <HI>tear</HI> him in Hell, where the Worm dieth not.</P>
<P N="5">5. Drunkenne&s;s unfits us for all <HI>publick</HI> Services.</P>
<P>How may Per&s;ons, di&s;tingui&s;h'd by Nature, and otherwi&s;e qualified for Po&s;ts of Honour, and the highe&s;t Stations in the civil Government, render them&s;elves incapable of &s;uch important Tru&s;ts, only by indulging a bruti&s;h Appetite after the Cup. I &s;ay, incapable. For Men of <HI>Rule,</HI> and Ju&s;tice, mu&s;t be Men of Temperance, and <HI>Sobriety:</HI> 'Tis not for <HI>Kings</HI> to drink Wine, nor for <HI>Princes</HI> &s;trong Drink; le&s;t they drink and forget the Law, and pervert the Judgment of the afflicted. And the &s;ame holds good in <HI>&s;acred</HI> Government. The <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Prophet</HI> have erred thro' &s;trong Drink; they are &s;wallowed up of Wine, they are out of the Way, thro' &s;trong Drink; they err in Vi&s;ion, they &s;tumble in Judgment. When Per&s;ons at the Helm of any Government reel them&s;elves, how can we expect that Government &s;hould be &s;teady, or the Admini&s;trations of it Re|gular? So that the <HI>Sot,</HI> is at be&s;t, but an in&s;ignifi|cant <HI>Cypher</HI> in human Society, and of all Men, is the mo&s;t unfit, to &s;erve his Generation.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="7" REF="003357_0008_0FF819CFADE58EB8">
6. It incapacitates Men for <HI>Church-Communion,</HI> and the Enjoyment of Special Ordinances.</P>
<P>We cannot drink the Cup of the <HI>Lord,</HI> and the Cup of <HI>Devils.</HI> What fellow&s;hip hath <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> with <HI>Drunkards ?</HI> How dare we drink the Con&s;ecrated Wine, and be filled with that wherein is <HI>Exce&s;s !</HI> To admit &s;uch to the Table of the Lord, is to give that which is Holy unto Dogs; which we dare not do, at our utmo&s;t Perils: And, if there be any Drunk|ards of <HI>our</HI> Communion, I &s;olemnly Charge them, either to Repent or Ab&s;ent.</P>
<P N="7">7. Drunkenne&s;s is an Enemy to the <HI>Life</HI> of Men.</P>
<P>How frequently is it attended with Surfeits? And how does it impair the Con&s;titution, and often be|come the Original of Mortal Di&s;tempers? And who hath Wo? who hath Sorrow? who hath Conten|tion? who hath Wounds without cau&s;e? who hath redne&s;s of Eyes! They that tarry long at the Wine, they that go to &s;eek mixt Wine. Wo unto them that ri&s;e up early in the morning, that they may fol|low Strong Drink; that continue until night, until Wine inflame them: Wo unto them, that are migh|ty to drink Wine, and Men of &s;trength, to mingle Strong Drink. How many Accidents are they expo|&s;ed to! They &s;ometimes fall from their Hor&s;es, in returning from the <HI>Tavern,</HI> and &s;ometimes &s;tumble on the dark Mountains, and break and brui&s;e their Limbs, when they e&s;cape with their Lives. They are Objects of contempt and &s;corn, to their Compa|ny, and &s;ubject to the in&s;ults of their Enemies. <HI>E|lah</HI> was drinking him&s;elf Drunk, in the hou&s;e of <HI>Arka,</HI> when <HI>Zimri</HI> &s;mote and killed him. <HI>Benhadad</HI> al&s;o was drinking him&s;elf Drunk, in the Pavilion, when <HI>I&s;rael</HI> came and &s;lew the <HI>Syrians.</HI> So, when De&s;truction was determined again&s;t <HI>Nabal,</HI> his heart was merry within him, for he was very Drunken. And, &s;ays <HI>Solomon,</HI> de&s;cribing the Drunkards &s;ecuri|ty, in the mo&s;t imminent Dangers, Thou &s;halt be as
<PB N="8" REF="003357_0009_0FF819D1EAD6DF88">he that lyeth down in the mid&s;t of the Sea, or as he that lyeth upon the Top of a Ma&s;t; They have &s;tricken me, &s;halt thou &s;ay, and I was not &s;ick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not.</P>
<P N="8">8. Drunkenne&s;s de&s;troys the <HI>Soul.</HI></P>
<P>The Drunkard drinks at infinite Expence; he parts with his Soul, to plea&s;e his Palate; and will rather ca&s;t his whole Body into Hell, then pluck out his right Eye. 'Tis a Sin that drowns Men in Perdition: For be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor <HI>Drunkards,</HI> &s;hall inherit the Kingdom of God. The works of the Fle&s;h are manife&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> Drunkenne&s;s, &amp;c. and &s;uch like, of the which I tell you before, as I have al&s;o told you in times pa&s;t, that they which do &s;uch things, &s;hall not inherit the Kingdom of God. A|wake, therefore ye Drunkards, and weep and howl, all ye drinkers of Wine: Take heed to your &s;elves, le&s;t at any time your hearts be overcharged with Drun|kenne&s;s, and the Day of the Lord come upon you unawares, and you drink of the wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured forth without mixture, in|to the Cup of His Indignation: for in the Hand of the Lord, is a Cup, and the Wine is red, and the Dregs thereof all the Wicked of the Earth &s;hall drink.</P>
<P>From the Character and <HI>Effects</HI> of exce&s;&s;ive Drink|ing, I pa&s;s</P>
<P N="2">II. To ob&s;erve the <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> why we &s;hould ab&s;tain and keep at the utmo&s;t Di&s;tance from the Cup. Or in the Words of my Text, not look upon the Wine when it is red. And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> of it are to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>'Tis a good Rea&s;on, which is &s;ubjoined to the Pre|cept. Who would be fond of the Adder's Sting? Or would not avoid the Bite of the Serpent? <HI>Drun|kenne&s;s</HI> is the Serpent and the Adder; the Con&s;equences of it makes it &s;o: They are very Pernicious; Per|nicious
<PB N="9" REF="003357_0010_0FF819D48C114B60">as I have de&s;cribed it, to the <HI>Pur&s;e,</HI> reducing Men and their Families to Want and Poverty; Per|nicious to their <HI>Reputation</HI> and Character; 'tis a <HI>lead|ing</HI> iniquity, attended with the complicated Crimes of <HI>Lu&s;t, Prophanene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Murder,</HI> and giving the Ene|my every Advantage over us; a Sin, that wounds the <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> fills it with Remor&s;e, or makes it Stupid and U&s;ele&s;s; that unfits for <HI>publick</HI> Service, both in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State;</HI> and that incapacitates us for Com|munion with <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or a Right to his Ordinances; an Enemy to the Health and <HI>Life</HI> of Man, and in the I&s;&s;ue, de&s;tructive to his <HI>Soul.</HI> What greater Con&s;i|deration can we have, to keep our Di&s;tance &amp; Guard? The Argument is fetched from both Worlds; from Body and Soul; Self and Neighbour, and Family; Reputation, Life and Intere&s;t. If Men have no Re|gard to the&s;e, what can prevail with them !</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e Temptations to Drunkenne&s;s, will never <HI>excu&s;e</HI> the Sin.</P>
<P>When we are &s;urpriz'd by Temptation, the Sin is &s;o far extenuated, and of le&s;s Aggravation in the Cir|cum&s;tance, but not wholly excu&s;eable; the Authority of <HI>God</HI> prohibiting, being infinitely Superiour to the Power of the <HI>Creature,</HI> tempting. But when we <HI>run</HI> into Temptation, I cannot &s;ee how the Power of it will, either excu&s;e, or extenuate a Fault. It will be no Plea for the Drunkard in the Day of Judgment, that he was <HI>tempted</HI> by the Cup. God may then ask him, What was the Rule of your Practice? Your own Appetite, or my Precept? Which ought to have had the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Influence upon you? The Authority of my Law, or the Per&s;wa&s;ions of the Creature? Was I to be contemn'd? Was my Law to be undervalu'd? My Threatnings de&s;pi&s;ed? And my Grace &s;lighted? And my Son rejected? for a contemptible Cup, and a brui|ti&s;h Gratification? Or, if the Temptations of Liquor were &s;o powerful, and the Charms of the Cup &s;o irre|&s;i&s;table, why did you Venture upon it? When your
<PB N="10" REF="003357_0011_0FF819D8A2D04310">Experience told you, once and again, your own Weak|ne&s;s and In&s;ufficiency, why did you not take the Warning? Why would you run again, among &s;otti&s;h Companions to <HI>Taverns</HI> and Hou&s;es of Perdition? If you could not forbear, nor moderate your Draught, you &s;hould not have gone, nor have look'd upon the Wine when it was red, when it gave his Colour in the Cup. Such Que&s;tions as the&s;e will &s;trike the Drunkard <HI>Speechle&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. We &s;hould keep our Di&s;tance from the Cup, be|cau&s;e we are &s;o often <HI>conquer'd</HI> by it.</P>
<P>Simply con&s;idered, it can be no Crime, to look upon the Wine when it is red, nor to drink it in Moderation. This <HI>Timothy</HI> him&s;elf might do; but the Con&s;equences of it make it Dangerous and Cri|minal. The Line of Divi&s;ion between Vertue and Vice, Good and Evil, is very narrow, and &s;oon &s;tept over; and to venture, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, to the Extremity of what is Lawful, is almo&s;t venturing upon what is otherwi&s;e. A Man that would not fall, mu&s;t not go too near the Precipice. A Man that will run in|to a publick Hou&s;e, is in Danger of looking upon the Wine; and he that looks upon the Wine, is in dan|ger of Drinking, and he that Drinks in danger of drinking to Exce&s;s. I appeal to the Experience of &s;ome Drunkards, whether they have not flatter'd them&s;elves, at fir&s;t, with the Tho'ts of Moderation, and been &s;ufficiently guarded, in their own Conceit, again&s;t all Exce&s;&s;es, and yet been <HI>in&s;en&s;ibly</HI> tempted, and drank away their Rea&s;on and Sen&s;es: If we ex|pect to be delivered from Evil, we mu&s;t not be led into Temptation. This &s;tands fir&s;t in the <HI>Lord's Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have I &s;hewn the pernicious <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> of Drunkenne&s;s; and the <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> why we &s;hould avoid the mo&s;t di&s;tant Temptations to it? I will not deny, but both the <HI>Propo&s;itions</HI> are directly, and <HI>de&s;ignedly,</HI> levell'd again&s;t <HI>Taverns;</HI> not again&s;t Taverns in their
<PB N="11" REF="003357_0012_0FF819DA99858DD8"><HI>original</HI> De&s;ign, when fir&s;t &s;et up to accommodate Strangers, and to provide again&s;t their Intru&s;ion into private Families: But again&s;t Taverns <HI>degenerated</HI> from their fir&s;t De&s;ign, and debauch'd and fill'd with &s;otti&s;h <HI>Neighbours.</HI> To &s;uch Hou&s;es we owe all the foremention'd Effects of Drunkenne&s;s. <HI>Here</HI> 'tis, that the Wine looks red, and moveth it &s;elf aright; <HI>Here</HI> 'tis that <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Art</HI> unite, and tempt the Palate, with agreeable Mixtures: The&s;e are the Hou&s;es, that make Men <HI>Beggars,</HI> that de&s;troy the Funds of <HI>Cha|rity,</HI> and <HI>rob</HI> Families of their ju&s;t and proper Live|lihoods. The&s;e are the Hou&s;es, that wound our <HI>Cha|racter</HI> and Reputation; that lead into Acts of <HI>Un|cleanne&s;s, Ho&s;tility, Murder</HI> and <HI>Prophanene&s;s;</HI> that wa&s;te and &s;tupify our <HI>Con&s;ciences;</HI> make us unfit for <HI>publick Service</HI> and <HI>Church</HI> Privileges: The&s;e are the Hou&s;es, that &s;trike at Men's <HI>Lives,</HI> Health and Con|&s;titution; that make Merchandi&s;e of their <HI>Souls;</HI> and in a Word, de&s;troy us for <HI>both</HI> Worlds. What a hea|vy Charge is this upon tho&s;e that keep them! Thou|&s;ands may cur&s;e them in <HI>this</HI> World, and the Blood of Thou&s;ands will cry again&s;t them in the next. If we are come to Hell, &s;ay they, <HI>You, you</HI> we may thank, in a great mea&s;ure for it. Our Mini&s;ters faith|fully warn'd us again&s;t the Sin of Drunkenne&s;s, and plainly told us the Con&s;equences of it; but you have tempted us into it; you fir&s;t tempted us to your Hou&s;es, and when you &s;aw us drink to Exce&s;s, you never put the Knife to our Throat, nor deny'd us Liquor, nor confin'd us to proper Hours; the longer we &s;taid, and the more we drank, the greater was your Profit from us, and you valued your <HI>Pur&s;e</HI> more than our <HI>Souls.</HI> Now, we cur&s;e the Day, when we knew you; we cur&s;e the Time, when we &s;tepp'd o|ver your Thre&s;hold, and the unhappy Hours we con|&s;um'd in <HI>Drinking</HI> at your Hou&s;es. I know <HI>Tavern</HI>-keepers think little of this; and plead, <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> to the whole Charge. We never, &s;ay they, forced

If they never <HI>forced,</HI> it was becau&s;e they could not: To <HI>tempt</HI> was all they could do, and this they did with all imaginable Art; and the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf is excu&s;ed, by the &s;ame Argu|ment, for he can only tempt, and has Power to force no Man: But if tho&s;e who keep &s;uch Hou&s;es regard not what I &s;ay, yet I expect &s;ome Regard from <HI>you,</HI> that hear me, and now &s;olemnly warn you again&s;t Taverns.</P>
<P N="1">1. I be&s;eech and charge you this Day, to exerci&s;e your Parental Affection, Authority, and Endeavours, to keep your <HI>Children</HI> from &s;uch Hou&s;es of Hell and Perdition.</P>
<P>They are young, and pa&s;&s;ionate, and more ea&s;ily tempted, than Age and Experience. Remember what hopeful Youths, have been deceived, and ruin'd by <HI>Taverns;</HI> Ruin'd I &s;ay, for <HI>Body</HI> &amp; <HI>Soul,</HI> for <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Eternity:</HI> And <HI>your</HI> Children are but <HI>Children</HI> of the &s;ame common nature and weakne&s;s with others, and it mu&s;t be your Parental Care, and the Exerci&s;e of your Authority over them, under God, if <HI>they</HI> e&s;cape the Snare, and fall not into the &s;ame Ditch. Had not the Parents in this Place, been too Remi&s;s in this great Duty, &s;o many of our Youth, 'tis probable, had not been &s;o Vicious, as they are. &mdash;Let this negli|gence, be never again reprov'd in you. If you have any regard to the intere&s;t of your Children in <HI>this</HI> World; If you value their <HI>Repute</HI> and Charact|er; if you would pre&s;erve a good <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> in them: If you have any compa&s;&s;ion for their <HI>Souls</HI> or <HI>Bodies.</HI> If you would have them dedicated to <HI>God,</HI> and devoted to His Service <HI>here,</HI> or dwell with Him <HI>hereafter;</HI> And (I will &s;ay) if the intere&s;ts of <HI>this</HI> Church, or that Religion, in general, which is pure and undefiled, have any weight with you; Keep them; Keep them from <HI>Taverns;</HI> Keep them at re|mote&s;t di&s;tance; Let them not go by the <HI>door</HI> of &s;uch
<PB N="13" REF="003357_0014_0FF819DF3578C050">Hou&s;es, nor be found in &s;uch Company, however civil and obliging, as would lead them <HI>there.</HI> Keep them, therefore, as much as may be, at <HI>Home,</HI> under the in&s;pection of your own Eye; for better follow your Children to their <HI>Graves,</HI> than &s;ee them run into Taverns.</P>
<P N="2">2. With the &s;ame Solemnity, and Earne&s;tne&s;s, I be&s;eech and charge you to ab&s;ent <HI>your &s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>If you are not &s;o ea&s;ily tempted as your Children, <HI>yet</HI> the Con&s;equences of your going are great, and you have no ju&s;t <HI>Plea</HI> for it. Neither from the Command of your Pa&s;&s;ions; nor from the nece&s;&s;ity of your <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It is no ju&s;t plea for a Man to &s;ay, I am &s;o well fortifyed by the Grace of God, and have my Pa&s;&s;ions in &s;o ju&s;t a &s;ubjection to my Rea&s;on, that for the &s;ake of agreeable Company, I may innocently enough fre|quent a <HI>Tavern.</HI> This I &s;ay, is not a ju&s;t Plea. For,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. You &s;tand by the <HI>Grace</HI> of God, and not by your own natural power. This you confe&s;s, and therefore ought to take heed, le&s;t you fall: If God withdraw His Grace, you will as &s;oon lo&s;e the com|mand of your Pa&s;&s;ions, as another, and drink with the Drunken.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. You <HI>tempt</HI> God, by going to withdraw His Grace. God's Grace never &s;uper&s;edes Man's endeavours; they always act in concurrence; and when Grace is thus abu&s;ed to wantonne&s;s, and pleaded as an argu|ment for Publick Hou&s;es, 'tis a Sovereign wonder, if it be not withdrawn.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Suppo&s;ing, God &s;hould continue His Grace, and you &s;hould have the command of your own Pa&s;|&s;ions; yet your example may embolden <HI>others,</HI> who perhaps, have not your Grace. They think 'tis e|nough to ju&s;tify them for ever, when they can &s;ay, &s;uch and &s;uch a Man, an eminent <HI>Profe&s;&s;or,</HI> and a re|puted Chri&s;tian, frequents the Tavern as well as we; and they will prophanely improve your very
<PB N="14" REF="003357_0015_0FF819E2B81E0B08"><HI>Sobriety</HI> as a further Argument in favour of their Pract|ice. Why &s;ay they, do our Preachers thunder out their Anathema's, and pretend &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary Con|nection betwixt Taverns and Drunkenne&s;s, when we &s;ee &s;o many return from them <HI>&s;ober</HI> as they went? And &s;o you de&s;troy the Soul of your Brother for whom Chri&s;t dyed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. You <HI>Countenance</HI> the thing it &s;elf, and practi|cally plead in vindication of tho&s;e, who keep &s;uch Hou&s;es, more than a <HI>Score,</HI> of the Prophane Chara|cter. They will too naturally think, that Tavern|keeping (in the very &s;en&s;e which I intend) is not a Crime, when Men of <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> thus en|courage it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. You give needle&s;s occa&s;ion of offence to them that are <HI>without.</HI>
<P>If you frequent a Tavern, behave your &s;elves with the utmo&s;t Guard and Caution you can; malicious Tongues will make it a cover for their Slanders, and wound the Church of God thro' your &s;ides.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. 'Tis &s;trange and wonderful, how a <HI>Tavern</HI> &s;hould afford agreeable Company to a Chri&s;tian, un|le&s;s Cur&s;ing, Swearing, and vain Babbling can be a|greeable to Sobriety, Mode&s;ty, and Piety. And the Truth is, when a Man runs to a <HI>Tavern</HI> for Com|pany, 'tis a &s;ign, he has little of the <HI>Saint</HI> in him. So that an Argument from this Character, and the command of our Pa&s;&s;ions, will not bear the Te&s;t. Nor</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="2">2. Will it an&s;wer better, to plead our <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> For, tis hard to conceive, why <HI>Taverns</HI> &s;hould be made the Stage of Bu&s;ine&s;s. An improper place 'tis, I'm &s;ure for any Tran&s;actions of tho't, and con&s;equence; amid&s;t Clamour, Drinking, Gaming, and all imagi|nable confu&s;ions. So that <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> is a meer pretence. Thus have I endeavour'd to expo&s;e the vile and per|nicious Sin of <HI>Drunkenne&s;s,</HI> and warn'd you faithful|ly again&s;t the <HI>Taverns.</HI> I have deliver'd my own Soul, and if you will not take the Warning, your Blood, and your Childrens Blood be upon your own Head.</P>
