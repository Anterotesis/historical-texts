<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Report has been made to me of a di&s;turbance that hap|pened at the barracks on Wedne&s;day afternoon, for which I am much concerned; and though the provocations from your people which originally occa&s;ioned it, were of the mo&s;t atrocious nature, I was willing the offender on our part &s;hould be properly puni&s;hed.&mdash;But Col. Henley, not content with that, made pri&s;oners eighteen innocent men, and &s;ent them on board a guard-&s;hip, as alledged by your order. It is not only a duty to my &s;ituation to demand the immediate di&s;charge of the&s;e men, together with a &s;atisfactory apology; but I al&s;o mean it as an attention to you, Sir that I give you an immediate opportunity to di&s;avow &s;o unju&s;tifiable a pro|ceeding as committing men to the wor&s;t of pri&s;ons upon vague report, caprice and pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In&s;ults and provocations at which the mo&s;t placid di&s;po&s;i|tions would revolt, are daily given to the officers and &s;ol|diers of this army.&mdash;Regular, decent complaints are received by your officers, &s;ometimes with haughtine&s;s, &s;ometimes with deri&s;ion, but always without redre&s;s.&mdash;The&s;e evils flow, Sir, from the general tenor of language and conduct held by Col. Henley, which encourages his inferiors and &s;eems calculated to excite them to the mo&s;t bloody purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>For want of &s;ufficient information and not bringing my|&s;elf to believe it po&s;&s;ible, facts as related by common re|port could be true, I have hitherto declined taking public notice of this man; but upon po&s;itive ground, I now, and hereby, formally accu&s;e Col. Henley of behaviour heinou&s;|ly criminal as an officer, and unbecoming a man&mdash;of the mo&s;t indecent, violent, vindictive &s;everity, again&s;t unarmed men, and of intentional murder.&mdash;I demand prompt and &s;atisfactory ju&s;tice, and will not doubt your readine&s;s to give it. Whenever you will inform me that a proper tribunal is appointed, I will take care that undeniable evidence &s;hall be produced to &s;upport the&s;e charges.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016139_0005_0F9B77BD02D95AD8">Col. David Henley came pri&s;oner before the Court, and the following charge was exhibited again&s;t him, viz.</P>
<P>"LIEUTENANT-General Burgoyne accu&s;es Colonel Henley, of a general tenor of language and conduct heinou&s;ly criminal as an officer; and unbecoming a man; of the mo&s;t indecent, violent, vindictive &s;everity again&s;t unarmed men; and of intentional murder."</P>
<P>To which accu&s;ations Col. Henley an&s;wer'd he was not guilty.</P>
<P>Ob&s;ervations of Gen. Burgoyne upon his letter of com|plaint to Gen. Heath, and the order for the Court-Martial con&s;equent thereupon, being read by the Judge-Advocate:</P>
<P>Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne aro&s;e and took occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve a di&s;tinction between the charge as &s;tated in his letter, and in Gen. Heath's orders. In the letter, the general tenor of Col. Henley's language and conduct, "Encouraging his inferiors, and &s;eeming calculated to excite them to bloody purpo&s;es," was matter of &s;u&s;picion, belief and rea&s;oning, upon the plain principle that it was more candid to &s;uppo&s;e one in&s;tigator of &s;uch evils, than a general voluntary bad di&s;po&s;ition among the American troops&mdash;that the direct mat|ters of charge which Gen. Burgoyne pledged him&s;elf for|mally and officially to &s;upport, was contained in the words "Behaviour heinou&s;ly criminal as an officer, and unbecom|ing a man, of the mo&s;t indecent, violent, vindictive &s;everity again&s;t unarmed men, and of intentional murder."</P>
<P>Gen. Burgoyne having &s;tated this ob&s;ervation, as a &s;ecurity again&s;t cen&s;ure of incon&s;i&s;tency on his part, for not going at large, and in matters of inferior moment into the general tenor of language and conduct of Col. Henley; declared he &s;hould confine his evidence to the tran&s;actions of the nine|teenth of December, and eighth of January, except in ca&s;es where the behaviour of Col. Henley at other times, &s;erved to elucidate the principles and de&s;igns upon which he acted on tho&s;e particular days; and Gen. Burgoyne admitted the words &s;hould &s;tand in the order, without remon&s;trance or trouble to the Court, upon the per&s;ua&s;ion that even as he has now limitted the time, a &s;ufficiency of evidence would ap|pear to make good the whole.&mdash;And then addre&s;&s;ed the Court in &s;ub&s;tance as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="016139_0006_0F9B77BDC6FD94D0">
<HI>Mr. Pre&s;ident and Gentlemen of the Court,</HI></P>
<P>I Pre&s;ent my&s;elf as pro&s;ecutor before you in charges of a heinous nature again&s;t Col. Henley&mdash;and before I begin to adduce the evidence in &s;upport of them, I think it a duty to my &s;tation, and a part of propriety towards the Court, to declare the principles upon which I act.</P>
<P>If the reports in my hand, and which will pre&s;ently be brought to te&s;t upon oath, do not deceive me, public faith has been &s;haken, wanton barbarities have been committed, and a general ma&s;&s;acre of the troops under my command ap|parently threatened.</P>
<P>In objects of this magnitude, where not only the rights of a &s;ingle nation, but the intere&s;ts of human nature are con|cerned, the effort of vindication falls indi&s;pen&s;ably:&mdash;How|ever di&s;agreeable the office, and unequal the talent of the per&s;on, to him who has the &s;upreme tru&s;t of his country upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>A &s;econd inducement to appear here, is that of private ho|nor.&mdash;I have undertaken to accu&s;e Col. Henley in a de|gree that ought to effect the feelings of a &s;oldier nearer than life.&mdash;It is fit that I &s;tand forth in per&s;on to maintain my ac|cu&s;ation, and if it fails in point of proof, to make him the fulle&s;t attonement in my power.</P>
<P>I acknowledge a third impul&s;ion upon my mind equally irre&s;i&s;table&mdash;gratitude, e&s;teem, affection to that meritorious, re&s;pectable part of my country, the brave and hone&s;t Bri|ti&s;h &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>A private man defencele&s;s, becau&s;e unarmed; ignorant of your laws; unqualified to make good his cau&s;e in a court of ju&s;tice,&mdash; has no where to look for redre&s;s of injury, but to his own officers.&mdash;I confe&s;s I am too &s;elfi&s;h to re&s;ign to any brother officer the pride and gratification of &s;tanding in the front, for the defence of men&mdash;faithful comrades of honor and misfortune&mdash;who have fought under my orders, who have bled in my pre&s;ence, and who are &s;uffering oppre&s;|&s;ion &amp; per&s;ecution by the abu&s;e of a treaty &s;igned by my hand.</P>
<P>Thus much I thought proper to premi&s;e, lea&s;t any man &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e me actuated by &s;o mean and paltry a motive as vindictive per&s;onal re&s;entment, again&s;t a gentleman too of whom before the&s;e tran&s;actions, I could know no harm, and towards whom if I had any prejudice, I &s;eriou&s;ly declare it
<PB N="8" REF="016139_0007_0F9B77C1FA266DC8">
was from his general deportment a favourable one:&mdash;Per&s;o|nal re&s;entment!&mdash;no gentlemen&mdash;I &s;tand upon broader and upon firmer ground, the ground of natural right&mdash;per&s;onal protection&mdash;and public honor&mdash;and I appeal to the great principles and land-marks by which human &s;ocieties hold and are directed, and which, whether in times of amity or ho&s;tility, are held equally &s;acred by the univer&s;al concurrence of civi|lized man.</P>
<P>And this leads me to a momentary reflection upon the order under which you &s;it, originating from the report of the Court of Inquiry. It &s;tates, "After mature con&s;ideration, are of opinion, that from the evidence offered on the &s;ide of Gen. Burgoyne, again&s;t Col. Henley, it will be mo&s;t for the honor of Col. Henley, as well as for the &s;atisfaction of all intere&s;ted, that the judgment of a Court-Martial &s;hould be taken on his conduct during his command at Cambridge."</P>
<P>"The General approving of the opinion of the Court, orders," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I expected Gen. Heath would have joined i&s;&s;ue with the pro&s;ecutor in this in&s;tance, and placed the court-martial upon a more enlarged ba&s;is than the honor of an individual, however re&s;pectable he may be, or the &s;atisfac|tion of the mere complainant&mdash;but be it as it may, my pur|po&s;e is an&s;wered&mdash;a court-martial is obtained; the members are &s;worn, and you are bound to decide. I know you will feel with me the difference between this and common courts: Such a &s;tate of the minutes as would &s;uffice for your internal conviction after hearing the evidence, or as would be merely explanatory to the per&s;on who is to confirm the &s;entence, will not be thought &s;ufficient here.</P>
<P>You well know the whole of this matter will be publi&s;h|ed, tran&s;lated, con&s;idered, commented upon by every nation in the world; and not only reality but per&s;picuity of ju&s;tice mu&s;t appear upon the face of the&s;e proceedings.&mdash;You are tru&s;tees for the honor of an infant &s;tate, and therefore eva&s;ion, &s;ubterfuge and law-craft, was any man hardy enough to offer &s;uch to your tribunal, would be of no avail; nay, were it po&s;&s;ible any member could be warped unintentionally by per&s;onal favour, or the prejudices of civil conte&s;t: Good minds are &s;ometimes prone to &s;uch illu&s;ions&mdash;yet here a mo|ment's reflection upon the reputation of his country, would interfere, and what his prejudice inclined him to adopt, his policy would prompt him to reject.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="016139_0008_0F9B77C332CC2680">Upon the full confidence therefore of the nece&s;&s;ary as well as willing ju&s;tice of the Court, I &s;hall proceed to call the evidence. I have neither inclination nor powers to heighten the facts by a previous narrative: Let them &s;trike the view, as truth &s;hall &s;hew them in all the &s;implicity of their horrors&mdash;a mon&s;trous &s;pectacle! from which the eye and the mind will turn a&s;ide with dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>The following witne&s;&s;es were called in, and being parti|cularly cautioned, were &s;worn:</P>
<P>Corporal Buchannan, 9th regiment.</P>
<P>Q. Was you pre&s;ent at the barracks on pro&s;pect-hill on the 19th December la&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I was.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;ee Col, Henley there?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Col. Henley came down and ordered a number of the Briti&s;h &s;oldier's who were pri&s;oners, out of the guard-hou&s;e: Col. Henley addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Corporal Reeves, with the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners, inquiring what he was confined for? Reeves &s;aid that he had affronted one of the Provincial offi|cers, not knowing him to be an officer, and he was &s;orry for it. Col. Henley reply'd, Sir, if you had &s;erved me &s;o, I would have run you thro' the body, and I believe you to be a great ra&s;cal. Reeves made an&s;wer, Sir, I am no ra&s;cal, but a good &s;oldier, and my officers know it. Col. Henley then demanded &s;ilence. On this, Reeves repeated I am no ra&s;cal, but a good &s;oldier, and I hope &s;oon to be under the com|mand of Gen. Howe, to carry arms, and to fight for my king and country. Col. Henley &s;aid, damn your king and coun|try&mdash;when you had arms you were willing to lay them down. Reeves &s;aid he was not willing to lay them down. Col. Hen|ley then ordered &s;ilence; Reeves not obeying his orders, but re|peating the &s;ame words, Col. Henley ordered one of the guard to run him thro' the body: the man not obeying him, Col. Henley immediately di&s;mounted from his hor&s;e, and &s;eizing a firelock with a fixed bayonet from one of the guard, &s;tabb'd Reeves in the left brea&s;t; while the bayonet was at Reeves's brea&s;t, Col. Henley told him if he &s;aid another word, he would have it thro' his body. Reeves &s;aid he did not care, he would &s;tand for his king and country 'till he died. Col. Henley then made another pu&s;h at him, when I threw up my hand and turned the bayonet over Reeves's &s;houlder.
<PB N="10" REF="016139_0009_0F9B77C460A596F8">
I told Col. Henley the man was a pri&s;oner, and &s;aid don't take his life; as he is now in your cu&s;tody, you can take other means with him: Col. Henley then return'd the fire|lock to the man of the guard he took it from&punc; and then or|dered Reeves and my&s;elf into the guard-room, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Q By Gen. Burgoyne&mdash;When Col. Henley made the &s;econd pa&s;s at Reeves, where would it have &s;truck him had you not thrown the bayonet up with your hand?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Much about the &s;ame place in the left brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Q When Col. Henley demanded &s;ilence, did he direct him&s;elf particularly to Reeves?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I can't tell, as there was ten or a dozen pri&s;oners who were making their excu&s;es together.</P>
<P>Q. Was there not much noi&s;e made by the pri&s;oners?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> There was, as they were all &s;peaking together.</P>
<P>Q By the Pre&s;ident.&mdash;What kind of noi&s;e was it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It was excu&s;ing them&s;elves to one another, &s;o that Col Henley might hear them; that they had been confined there for &s;ome nights, and they &s;hould take care not to come there again.</P>
<P>Q. By the Pre&s;ident.&mdash;Was there any other &s;ort of noi&s;e or laughing?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
<P>Q By the Court&mdash;Was there any muttering or grumb|ling, or in&s;olent looks directed to Col. Henley?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, but quite the rever&s;e; the men &s;eemed plea&s;ed at being relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Alexander Thomp&s;on, 29th regiment.</P>
<P>Q. Was you pre&s;ent at or near the barracks on Pro&s;pect-Hill on the 19th of December?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I was, and &s;aw Col. Henley there&mdash;Col. Henley coming up, ordered the pri&s;oners out of the guard-hou&s;e, of whom I was one&mdash;the pri&s;oners were drawn up before the guard-room window, the guard in their front&mdash;Col. Henley pulling a paper out of his pocket&punc; began to read the crimes at the right of the line of the pri&s;oners&mdash;Col. Henley &s;aid, now &s;oldiers I am come to relea&s;e you, and hope you will behave better for the future&mdash;Col. Henley directing him|&s;elf to corporal Reeves, told him he was confined for abu|&s;ing an officer of the Continental &s;ervice; and a&s;ked him what was the rea&s;on of his abu&s;e? Reeves replied he did
<PB N="11" REF="016139_0010_0F9B77C49EB68898">
not know the rea&s;on of the abu&s;e as he was in liquor at the time, but &s;aid he was very &s;orry for it, not knowing him to be an officer: Col. Henley then &s;aid had it been me, I would have certainly run you thro' the body, and added, I believe you to be a ra&s;cal. Reeves &s;aid he was no ra&s;cal, but was a good &s;oldier, and his officers knew it: Col. Henley demand|ed &s;ilence and Reeves again &s;aid that he was a good &s;oldier, and hoped in a &s;hort time to fight under Gen. Howe for his king and country: Col. Henley then &s;aid, damn your king and country, when you had arms you were willing to lay them down. Corporal Reeves made an&s;wer that he was not willing to lay them down, and had he then arms, he would do his ut|mo&s;t to fight for his king and country; Col. Henley then order'd one of his guard to run the ra&s;cal thro'. The man not obeying, he immediately di&s;mounted his hor&s;e, &s;eized a firelock with a fix'd bayonet from one of the guard, ex|tended his arm above his head, with his hand on the butt of the fire-lock, and made a pa&s;s at corporal Reeves and prick'd him near the nipple of the leaft brea&s;t; he then drew back the fire-lock and made another pa&s;s at him; I then &s;eized hold of the &s;ocket of the bayonet and begg'd of Col. Henley not to take his life, that he might u&s;e other means of &s;atis|faction, and begg'd he would &s;end him into the guard-room again; Col. Henley then order'd Reeves into the guard-room, the guard committed him, and Col. Henley went on to &s;peak to the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners. Reeves put his head out of the guard-hou&s;e window and &s;aid &s;omething, but the deponent does not know what. Col. Henley then relea&s;ed the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners, except Buchannan, who was orde|red into the guard-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Q. By the Pre&s;ident.&mdash;Was there noting &s;aid by Reeves between the fir&s;t and &s;econd pa&s;s of Col. Henley?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To the be&s;t of my recollection there was not.</P>
<P>Q. Did not Col. Henley frequently command &s;ilence be|fore he &s;tabb'd Reeves?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I believe he did more than once or twice.</P>
<P>Q. Did not Col. Henley direct him&s;elf to Reeves when he demanded &s;ilence?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He look'd fir&s;t at Reeves, and then along the line of pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Q Was not Reeves more talkative than any of the other pri&s;oners?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He was.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="016139_0011_0F9B77C54DBD26A0">Q. Was there any thing &s;aid about King Hancock?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I heard nothing.</P>
<P>The &s;ame que&s;tion was put to Buchannan.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not 'till after Reeves was returned to the guard-room, and the other pri&s;oners di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; Reeves then &s;aid to me (Buchannan) this is a poor pa&s;s I am come to, to be taken out of the guard-hou&s;e and &s;tabb'd, and my king and country damn'd&mdash;damn King Hancock and the Congre&s;s. Whether Col. Henley heard it or not I can't &s;ay; he might have heard it: This di&s;cour&s;e was between Reeves and my|&s;elf as we &s;tood near the guard-hou&s;e window.</P>
<P>Q. To Thomp&s;on.&mdash;Did any one a&s;&s;i&s;t you in warding off the &s;econd pa&s;s made by Col. Henley at Reeves?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; Corporal Buchannan had hold of the firelock at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Q. Did not Col. Henley addre&s;s the pri&s;oners when they were fir&s;t paraded, in a mild and civil manner?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He did.</P>
<P>Dr. Bowen, acting &s;urgeon to the 9th regiment.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;ee corporal Reeves after he was wounded by Col. Henley?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I did a few hours after; the wound appeared to be made by a bayonet, it penetrated the brea&s;t a little above the left nipple; the wound was not &s;o bad as to require imme|diate dre&s;&s;ing; the wound was &s;light, it did not penetrate deep enough to be of any con&s;equence, it might have drawn a drop or two of blood.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> I was.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;ee Col. Henley there?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I did; Col. Henley came down to relea&s;e &s;ome Bri|ti&s;h &s;oldiers, pri&s;oners in the guard-hou&s;e there; the pri&s;o|ners were ordered out and paraded in the front of the guard-hou&s;e; Col. Henley a&s;ked the pri&s;oners their names, and what crimes they were confined for? corporal Reeves told him that he was confin'd for abu&s;ing a Provincial officer in Cambridge, and &s;aid he did not know him to be an officer, if he had he would not have abu&s;ed him, was very &s;orry for it, and ready to a&s;k his pardon; Col. Henley made an&s;wer that if it had been him he had abu&s;ed, he would certainly have run him thro', and told him he believed him to be a damn'd ra&s;cal. Reeves reply'd I am no ra&s;cal, Sir, but a good &s;oldier, and my officers know it; and I hope in a &s;hort time to join Gen. Howe, and fight for my king and coun|try. Col. Henley reply'd, damn your king and country, what do we care for your king and country; when you had arms you laid them down very willingly. No, Sir, Reeves reply'd, we did not, we were willing to fight. Upon this, Col. Hen|ley order'd one of the guard to run him thro', his order not being comply'd with, Col. Henley di&s;mounted from his hor&s;e, &s;eiz'd one of the guard's fire-lock and &s;tabb'd Reeves in the brea&s;t; Reeves demanded the rea&s;on of his &s;tabbing him? Col. Henley cry'd &s;ilence, Sir, and made another pa&s;s at him, two of the pri&s;oners who &s;tood neare&s;t Reeves, &s;eiz'd the fire-lock, and de&s;ired Col. Henley not to take his life, as he was a pri&s;oner, and his life was in his hands: Col. Henley then told him he would &s;end him on board a guard-&s;hip, and ordered him into the guard-room; he releas'd the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners, excepting Reeves and corporal Buchan|nan.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> I was di&s;tant about thirty yards, and neither &s;aw or heard any provocation on the part of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers to the Continental guard; I was attentively counting the files of the guard as they pa&s;&s;ed; when the rear of the guard came near the Briti&s;h guard-room, I ob&s;erv'd a &s;cuffle, the guard pa&s;&s;ed on; I went up and found Traggot, a Briti&s;h &s;oldier, had been wounded by one of the guard as I was told, and the blood was then running down the &s;ide of his face. I order'd the men to di&s;per&s;e and they went off immediately.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Both before and after.</P>

<P>Lieut. Col. An&s;truther.]</P>
<P>Q. DID you &s;ee Colonel Henley on the 8th of January?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> On the 8th of January, my orderly &s;erjeant came and inform'd me that on the night of 7th, twelve men of my re|giment had been taken out of the barracks; upon the report, I &s;et out for the barracks, and in my way heard they were brought down to Col. Henley's quarters, I went to Col. Henley to inquire into the cau&s;e of their confinement: at Col. Henley's gate, I was deny'd admittance by two cen|tries; after &s;ome time, upon application to an officer, I got admittance to Col. Henley, and upon enquiring into the cau&s;es of my men's confinement, was referr'd to a gentleman, who I afterwards under&s;tood was Col. Gerri&s;h of the militia, who told me the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers had behaved very odd the night before, and that he had a great mind to have fir'd into the door and windows of the barracks upon them, and &s;hould have done it, had he not been afraid of killing &s;ome of his own men; upon ob&s;erving this was very odd to Col. Hen|ley, Col Henley told me that the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers had behaved &s;o hadly that morning, that he was obliged to run one of them thro' the body, and that &s;ome others had been hurt by his men's bayonets: I then left Col. Henley and went down to the barracks, where on enquiry I found one of the men had been out of his barrack after nine o'clock; I order'd him confin'd; a regimental court-martial &s;et upon him, and &s;en|tenced the man to be puni&s;h'd for the offence; the proceed|ings were communicated to Col. Henley, and an officer &s;ent to know if Col. Henley would order out his men to &s;ee the puni&s;hment inflicted&mdash;Col. Henley &s;ent me word back I might do as I plea&s;ed with the man, but he &s;hould not inter|fere, or order his men out.&mdash;The man receiv'd his puni&s;hment the next day at 12 o'clock, in the pre&s;ence of the whole re|giment.</P>
<P>Q. Did the man who was puni&s;hed for being out of his barrack belong to the &s;ame room where the twelve men were taken?</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="016139_0026_0F9B77F8FAFF60D8"><HI>A.</HI> He did not, but to a room in a different part of the barrack.</P>
<P>Q. By Gen. Burgoyne.&mdash;When you went down to the barrack did you make a particular inquiry into the tran&s;acti|ons of the preceeding night?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> As far as I was able I did; and found on an examina|tion of the non-commi&s;&s;ion'd officers that the men had be|haved peaceably, except one man who being in liquor, had been out of his barrack after nine o'clock, and who I had puni&s;hed as before related.</P>

<P>Dr. Bowen acting &s;urgeon 9th regiment.]</P>
<P>Q. Did you attend corporal Hadley from the time of his being wounded?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I attended him except the fir&s;t dre&s;&s;ing. About one o'clock on the 8th in&s;t. I was called to dre&s;s corporal Had|ley's wounds, and &s;ound upon examination, the &s;word had pa&s;s'd thro' the left arm and entered his left &s;ide; I dre&s;s'd his wound, the in&s;trument had penetrated the membrane under the &s;kin that lies over the mu&s;cle.</P>
<P>Q. Was the wound, &s;o deep in the &s;ide as to require im|mediate dre&s;&s;ing?</P>
<P><HI>A</HI> It did.</P>
<P>Q. Was the wound of &s;uch a nature as to put the man's life in danger?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It was not.</P>
<P>Q. What part of the arm did the &s;word pa&s;s through?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It pa&s;s'd over the mu&s;cles on the back of the arm.</P>
<P>Q. What was the di&s;tance of the two orifices on the arm?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> About half an inch or a little more.</P>
<P>Q. How long did you dre&s;s the wound in the &s;ide?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Near a week, when it was well; I dre&s;s'd the wound daily 'till it was heal'd.</P>
<P>Q. What is the &s;tate of the wound in the arm now?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is well; I dre&s;s'd it 'till about &s;ix days ago, when it was &s;o far heal'd as to require no further dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Q. By General Burgoyne.&mdash;Suppo&s;ing the &s;word to have mi&s;s'd the arm, would it have penetrated &s;o far as to make the wound dangerous?</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="016139_0027_0F9B77FBD7FF5750"><HI>A.</HI> I imagine it would have penetrated the cavity had not a ribb interfered, and in that ca&s;e it mu&s;t have been dangerous.</P>
<P>Q Are you po&s;itive that the &s;word did not touch a ribb?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I am po&s;itive it did not.</P>
<P>Q. Do you think the re&s;i&s;tance of the cloaths and the fle&s;h of the arm &s;ufficient to have bent the &s;word?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I make no doubt but they were.</P>
<P>Q. Mu&s;t not the pa&s;s then have been made with con&s;i|derable violence?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Certainly.</P>
<P>Q. By the Court.&mdash;Did it appear from the nature and direction of the wound that Col. Henley de&s;ign'd to have taken the man's life.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> From its pa&s;&s;ing &s;o &s;lightly thro' the arm, I imagine the &s;word was aim'd at the body.</P>
<P>Q. By the Court.&mdash;Were the wounds &s;uch as to take him off his duty?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They were; and he has not been return'd well 'till within the&s;e three or four days.</P>

<P>Q. By General Burgoyne&mdash;Was you pre&s;ent at any time in December when a Provincial &s;entry fir'd at one or more Women?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I was; on or about the 22d December, being field-officer of the week, I was going upon Pro&s;pect-hill in the forenoon with Capt. Banks of the &s;ame regiment, I &s;aw three women coming down the hill, one of which run pa&s;t a Con|tinental &s;entry, who call'd upon her to &s;top, and immediately fir'd his piece before &s;he had time to turn round, the ball from the noi&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed between the woman and my&s;elf, and near me; I order'd the woman to go back, and went up to the centry and a&s;k'd him if he was not a&s;ham'd to fire upon a helple&s;s woman, he reply'd he had orders for &s;o doing; I then went to a &s;erjeant's guard which was ju&s;t by, told the &s;erjeant what had happen'd, and de&s;ired him to confine the &s;entry that the affair might be inquired into; he told me he would not confine him, that they had orders to fire upon all Briti&s;h &s;oldiers and women, who attempted to pa&s;s the &s;en|tries; I ob&s;erved a number of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers were collect|ing who were murmuring and clamouring at the time. I therefore, for fear of the con&s;equences, de&s;ir'd them imme|diately

The &s;erjeant told the man to take away his gun, tel|ling me he was a young &s;oldier and did not know better, the captain of the guard came up &s;oon after and I pulled my hat off, which he took no notice of. I then told him the acti|on of the &s;entry's firing on the woman, and begged the &s;en|try might be confin'd 'till the affair &s;hould be inquired into; he told me that he would not, and that the &s;entries had par|ticular orders to fire on all women who attempted to pa&s;s the &s;entries, as well as &s;oldiers. I ob&s;erved it mu&s;t be &s;ome mi&s;take, he reply'd it was none of his bu&s;ine&s;s, they were his orders, and I mu&s;t &s;eek redre&s;s &s;omewhere el&s;e, and we parted.</P>
<P>Q From the po&s;ition of the &s;entry at the time he fired, were not pa&s;&s;engers on the road expo&s;ed to the &s;hot?</P>

<P>Judge-Advocate.]</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Pre&s;ident and Gentlemen of the Court,</HI></P>
<P>GENERAL Burgoyne having claimed liberty of re|marking upon the evidence, and argumentatively &s;upporting the charge again&s;t Col. Henley, I ri&s;e to object to his claim. In Courts-Martial, there is no pro&s;ecutor but the Judge-Advocate; there have been in&s;tances of Council allowed the pri&s;oner, but not again&s;t him: And I call upon the Generals and Field-Officers of the Briti&s;h army, now
<PB N="31" REF="016139_0030_0F9B77FF06FACDE0">
in Court, to point out a &s;ingle exception to what I have ad|vanced; yet if Col. Henley has no objection, and the Court concedes to it as an indulgence, I &s;hall acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne expre&s;&s;ed &s;urpri&s;e at the Judge-Advo|cate's exception being made &s;o late in the cau&s;e; he thought it more particularly extraordinary, as the General had not only &s;tated his idea of the mode of proceeding at the fir&s;t, in which the Judge-Advocate had acquie&s;ced, but at the la&s;t meeting it had been fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in open Court between them, and the Judge-Advocate had agreed to the General's right both of applying the evidence upon the charge, and al&s;o of replying to the defence, provided he, the Judge-Ad|vocate, had the clo&s;ing of the whole. The General ob&s;er|ved that had the Court declared again&s;t this claim in the be|ginning, or cou'd he have expected &s;uch objection, he &s;hould have examined the witne&s;&s;es in a very different manner, in order to bring &s;everal matters more fully and pointedly be|fore the Court than he thought nece&s;&s;ary to do upon the &s;up|po&s;ition of a future occa&s;ion to explain the rea&s;ons of his que&s;tions, and by deduction and inference to make the application.</P>
<P>The General neverthele&s;s propo&s;ed that the principle upon which he &s;poke &s;hould lie dormant to avoid trouble to the Court, that he had his own opinion upon the right, the Judge Advocate might retain his upon the indulgence, pro|vided nothing concerning the matter was entred upon the proceedings, he &s;hould make u&s;e of the power without fur|ther que&s;tion.</P>

<P>The Court then told the General he might proceed, and he addre&s;&s;ed the Court as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Pre&s;ident and Gentlemen of the Court,</HI></P>
<P>IT being now admitted that in clo&s;ing the evidence, I may offer &s;uch arguments as to me &s;hall &s;eem proper, in &s;up|port of the charge, and re&s;erving to my&s;elf a claim of reply|ing to the defence, I &s;hall enter upon the fir&s;t part of the very painful, tho' by no means difficult undertaking:&mdash;
<PB N="32" REF="016139_0031_0F9B77FFC41CC7B8">
Painful, becau&s;e I cannot pur&s;ue the offence without &s;etting the offender in points of view at which every benignant mind mu&s;t &s;hudder&mdash;Ea&s;y in every other re&s;pect is the ta&s;k, becau&s;e I venture to pronounce the evidence when arranged and adju&s;ted, will amount to &s;uch a ma&s;s of proof as cannot be overthrown, and will authori&s;e and call for the &s;tronge&s;t terms I can u&s;e in my demand of public ju&s;tice. And Gen|tlemen, let me be permitted to a&s;&s;ume to my&s;elf applau&s;e rather than blame, that the evidence has not been laid be|fore you in a regular &s;eries; the rea&s;on was, that though a&s;&s;ured by the reports made to me that the evidence would produce conviction upon the whole, I was ignorant how the te&s;timony of the particular witne&s;&s;es would ap|ply and point to the progre&s;&s;ion of the charges, be|cau&s;e I had had no previous intorcour&s;e with them. I declare upon my &s;olemn word of honor, that I have had no concert or communication directly or indirectly with any non-commi&s;&s;ioned officer or &s;oldier who has appeared at your bar, one only excepted, viz. &s;erjeant Fleming of the 47th regiment, who has depo&s;ed to the &s;alutation Col. Henley, gave to him at the Adjutant-General's office; that whole matter appeared to me &s;o very improbable, that I not only &s;ent for the &s;erjeant to warn him of the &s;acredne&s;s of an oath, and of the &s;in of intemperate zeal, but al&s;o I thought it my duty to inquire minutely into his character; I found the man firm and uniform in averting his veracity, I found his officers unanimous in &s;upporting his credit.</P>
<P>In every other in&s;tance I adhered religiou&s;ly to the determination I had taken of &s;ecluding my&s;elf from the wit|ne&s;&s;es, not only to guard my character in this region of &s;u&s;|picion and a&s;per&s;ion, again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ition of unfair practi|ces; I be&s;ides had a &s;cruple of tru&s;ting my own mind with too ha&s;ty progre&s;&s;ions in a cau&s;e wherewith the mo&s;t &s;olemn matter of a public nature is involved the fate of a gentleman high in his military &s;tation, and to judge by the apparent &s;igns of good wi&s;hes on this day, al&s;o high in popular e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Thus unprejudiced I came into your court, I &s;corn to rake up the &s;lighter matters that might be comprehended in the general words of the charge, &s;uch as per&s;onal incivility to officers expre&s;&s;ions and actions of peevi&s;hne&s;s, haughti|ne&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t. I mean not to pre&s;s that they exi&s;ted, or if they did, I am de&s;irous they &s;hould pa&s;s as faults of temper

and deficiencies of manners incident to a man's nature, edu|cation and habitual cour&s;e of life; and I &s;hall confine my comment as it is my duty to do, to the te&s;timonies upon your minutes, and the circum&s;tances immediately relating to them.</P>
<P>Without departing from this principle, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a general review of the &s;tate of things previous to the date of the grievances complained of.</P>
<P>We arrived at Cambridge pa&s;&s;engers through your coun|try under the &s;anction of a truce. In whatever capacity we had been found in a foreign and independent &s;tate, we were intitled to per&s;onal protection by the general and mo&s;t &s;acred laws of truth and rea&s;on; but when to the promulgated law of civilization are added the written principles&mdash;or written only upon the hearts of generous people&mdash;honor, re&s;pect for the brave, the ho&s;pitable wi&s;hes that u&s;ually pre&s;s to the re|lief of the unfortunate, the &s;tranger, and the defencele&s;s man in your power, how will our claims multiply upon the mind? Sanguine imaginations conceived yet further motives for kindne&s;s. There were men among us &s;o vain as to believe that notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent &s;eparation between us, the different duties we now maintained, the prejudices of politi|cal zeal, and the animo&s;ity of civil war;&mdash;Yet &s;till the con|flict over, it might be remembered we once were brothers, and the more e&s;pecially as it was improbable by the Conven|tion of Saratoga, that the generality of us &s;hould ever oppo&s;e America in arms again.</P>
<P>We were led into the&s;e delu&s;ive hopes by the very honor|able treatment &s;hewn us by General Gates, by that we re|ceived from you Mr. Pre&s;ident when you conducted us upon the march, and from that we afterwards found from the worthy member of the Court near you, who had the imme|diate command in this di&s;trict upon our arrival and to whom mo&s;t happily for us the &s;ame command is now again de|volved.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ymptom we di&s;covered of any uncandid de&s;igns, was the mode e&s;tabli&s;hed for correcting errors and di&s;turban|ces in the troops of the Convention; men were taken up, impri&s;oned, and otherwi&s;e puni&s;hed by the American troops, without any prior reference to their own officers. I very well know with how much &s;light and even deri&s;ion my &s;enti|ments have been treated upon this &s;ubject; but I &s;till <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="34" REF="016139_0033_0F9B780332B29B70">
that after taking men up for faults, to have applied to the officers of the Convention troops in the fir&s;t in&s;tance for their puni&s;hment, would have been con&s;onant to every principle of decorum and good policy; not meaning to deny that upon any proof of partiality, or connivance, or undue lenity, it then became the proper and indi&s;pen&s;able duty of General Heath, to take the di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice into his own hands.</P>
<P>The contrary maxim having been e&s;tabli&s;hed, let us exa|mine how it was carried into execution.&mdash;And the fir&s;t circum|&s;tance in point of time, tho' the la&s;t in the proceedings, is that bur&s;t of indecency, &s;currility and impiety, from Col. Honley to the Quarter-Ma&s;ter-Serjeants at the Adjutant-General's office&mdash;it is not without difficulty I can frame my mouth to read the words as they were delivered upon oath, by that very re&s;pectable witne&s;s Serjeant Fleming, viz.&mdash; "You ra&s;cals, I'll make damnation fly out of ye, and I will my&s;elf one of the&s;e nights go the rounds, and if I hear me lea&s;t word or noi&s;e in your barracks, I'll pour &s;hot among&s;t ye, and make flames of hell jump out of ye, and turn your barracks in&s;ide-out."</P>
<P>The Court will remember that when this evidence was given, it rather excited laughter in &s;ome part of the audience, than any &s;erious condemnation.</P>
<P>This day it &s;eems to make a very different impre&s;&s;ion.&mdash; The minds of all around will follow me, while I contend that expre&s;&s;ions &s;o wild, &s;o unfit, &s;o unprecedented from the mouth of a gentleman, argue the mo&s;t diabolical pa&s;&s;ions boiling in the brea&s;t, the very enthu&s;ia&s;m of rancour and malice.</P>
<P>I defy any man to divert him&s;elf of that idea, it will at|tend the mind through the whole cour&s;e of the&s;e proceed|ings, and ca&s;t a &s;hocking glare over every &s;ub&s;equent tran&s;|action, of fore-thought, intention and bloody re&s;olution.</P>
<P>It is very material to ob&s;erve that this demon&s;tration of Col. Henley's mind, was on or about the 16th December, and it was no longer than 'till 19th, before he confirmed by overt act the principles he had profe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;tabbing of Corporal Reeves is proved by the evi|dence of Corporal Buchannan, Alexander Thomp&s;on and Robert Steel.</P>
<P>I &s;hall quote indi&s;crminately from the te&s;timony of one or other of the&s;e witne&s;&s;es, becau&s;e tho' &s;ome recollect a few

&s;hort pa&s;&s;ages or words more than others, there is not a &s;ha|dow of contradiction, and I am confident there never was an in&s;tance where truth was ever laid before a Court by united evidence more per&s;picuou&s;ly.</P>
<P>It has been &s;worn "That on the morning of the 19th of December, Col. Henley went to the barracks on Pro&s;pect-Hill, to relea&s;e &s;ome Briti&s;h &s;oldiers who were pri&s;oners; that having had them paraded, he read over their crimes, and coming to Reeves told him he was confin'd for in&s;ulting a Provincial officer; Reeves made an&s;wer be was very &s;orry for it, that he was in liquor, and would not have acted &s;o had he known him to have been an officer."&mdash;I pau&s;e here to apply to the feelings of the Court, whether a more decent, proper, &s;atisfactory excu&s;e could have been conceiv|ed; what did it draw from the Colonel?&mdash;"Had it been me you had &s;erved &s;o, I would have run you thro' the body you ra&s;cal"&mdash;Continue the compari&s;on between the language of the Colonel and the Corporal&mdash;Sir, I am no ra&s;cal, but a good &s;oldier, and my officers know it, and I hope &s;oon to be with Gen. Howe and fight for my king and country&mdash;what did this produce from the Colonel?&mdash;"Damn your king and country," and an order to the guard "to run him through the body,"&mdash;not a hand nor a heart could be found for the butchery; the Colonel enraged at the virtuous di&s;obedience of his men, leaps from his hor&s;e, &s;eizes a firelock with a fix'd bayonet, and &s;trikes at the man's heart. I call upon the gentleman of a learned profe&s;&s;ion near me to inform the Court when he &s;ums up the evidence at the clo&s;e of the trial, whether this act would not con&s;titute malice propen&s;e in law. I mean that admitting for the &s;ake of the argument, that there had been &s;uch provocation given as would have ju&s;tified a man having an offen&s;ive weapon to make u&s;e of it in&s;tantly, which would have been only man&s;laughter; the intermediate act of di&s;mounting his hor&s;e and taking a firelock from the other, implying time for recollection, would have made the act wil|ful murder, had the man died. Con&s;ider now gentlemen what followed.&mdash; The brave Corporal in the in&s;tant expec|tation his words would co&s;t him his life, per&s;evered&mdash;I don't care, I will &s;tand by my king and country 'till I die. The action would have charmed a brave man; it would have been a &s;pell upon his arm, and kept the &s;troke &s;u&s;pended beyond the power of witchcraft&mdash;What effect had it upon the Colonel
<PB N="36" REF="016139_0035_0F9B78072A838B80">
&mdash;to provoke a &s;econd &s;tab, which was only diverted by the intervention of the man next him, who caught hold of the bayonet and threw it up.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, when I &s;ay the per&s;everance of the corpo|ral ought rather to have plea&s;ed than provoked. I &s;peak not vaguely or romantically, I feel con&s;cious proof of the truth&mdash; and when I con&s;ider the actions of a Wa&s;hington&mdash;when I meet in the field a Gates, an Arnold, a General Glover&mdash; and &s;ee them bravely facing death in &s;upport of their princi|ples, though I would &s;hed my la&s;t blood upon a different conviction, I cannot withhold from the enemy the re&s;pect due to the &s;oldier, and the immediate conflict over, he robs me of my anger and &s;eizes my good will.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, in the different parts of the examination up|on this fact, many que&s;tions have been a&s;ked by the pri&s;oner, by the Judge-Advocate, and by the Court re&s;pecting the appearance of the pri&s;oner's temper&mdash;was he not in a mild mood?&mdash;Did he not &s;eem good humour'd? Mild murder! Good humour'd murder!&mdash;are phra&s;es I fancy will not convey any clear meaning, 'till men change their ideas of that crime.&mdash;We hear 'tis true &s;ometimes as a &s;ort of proverb to mark the utmo&s;t malignity and treachery of a man &s;miling in your face while he cuts your throat, but I believe it never was produced as an excu&s;e or extenuation of guilt.&mdash;The&s;e que&s;tions therefore, as I conceive can have no tendency but to in&s;inuate that Col. Henley's pa&s;&s;ion was entirely rai&s;ed by the immediate provocation he received; I am ready to join i&s;&s;ue upon this argument, and if the Gentleman will re&s;t his cau&s;e upon it, I will relinqui&s;h the proof e&s;ta|bli&s;hed of Reeve's decency and con&s;i&s;tency, and give him latitude for all the provocation he can &s;uppo&s;e, &s;hort of per|&s;onal a&s;&s;ault, and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-defence, which I am &s;ure will not be pretended.&mdash;I will tran&s;po&s;e if he plea&s;es the time when Reeves is proved to have talked about King Hancock, and bring it back to the in&s;tant where it was at|tempted to be introduced, as a &s;ub&s;tantial matter of provoca|tion&mdash;he &s;hall add in&s;olence of ge&s;ture to abu&s;ive terms, and under all the&s;e fictitious circum&s;tances I will take the judg|ment of the Court, whether Col. Henley with full power to impri&s;on and to puni&s;h by regular, decent, legal proceed|ing, has a &s;hadow of ju&s;tification <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> making him&s;elf in his own per&s;on, party, judge and executioner.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="016139_0036_0F9B780742618328">From the 19th December, the hands of Col. Henley were unembrued in blood 'till the 8th of January, but it evidently appears upon your proceedings that the influence of his ex|ample and the encouragement of his precepts failed not to operate, as the fir&s;t proof of it. I reque&s;t the attention of the Court to the te&s;timony of Col. Lind; the po&s;ition of the &s;entry which was &s;uch as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily effect every pa&s;&s;en|ger upon the public road whenever he fired, and at the &s;ame time a readine&s;s to do mi&s;chief &s;o marked that he took wo|men for his objects, and would not give them time to turn round; he had orders &s;o to do. Let the behavior of the next &s;entry to whom Col. Lind applied, the ungentleman-like behavior of the officer, with his confirmation of the whole proceeding, being according to order, be combined and compared, and it mu&s;t univer&s;ally &s;trike common &s;en&s;e, that the&s;e were &s;everal parts of one determined plan to dif|fu&s;e the &s;eeds of di&s;cord and fury, in order afterwards to countenance a general havock.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid the orders under which the Continen|tal troops acted were not tho&s;e of Col. Henley, but of a &s;uperior&mdash;will that be pleaded? was the po&s;ition of the &s;entries to kill or wound three or four pa&s;&s;engers at a &s;hot, the firing upon innocent women, the refu&s;al of redre&s;s to Col. Lind, with all the indecent manner and language attend|ing; will the&s;e circum&s;tances be alledged to have proceeded from &s;uperior orders? If &s;o, the excu&s;e becomes indeed more alarming to us.&mdash;It is my part at this time to drop a con&s;ideration that would lead &s;o far.&mdash;I &s;hall only remark how little the excu&s;e would benefit Col. Henley, who would &s;till remain a cruel agent of (I will u&s;e no improper term) I will only &s;ay a cruel agent of a too ha&s;ty principal.</P>
<P>Col. Henley has a&s;ked whether complaint was made to him of the tran&s;actions of the 22d&mdash;I believe they were not&mdash;but I dare &s;ay he will recollect the rea&s;ons&mdash;other grievances of the mo&s;t atrocious nature, abu&s;e of offi|cers, and a&s;&s;aults upon their lives, were preparing to lay before General Heath. They were in number and in time to have filled up much more of the interval between the 19th December and 8th January; but not brought before this Court becau&s;e I under&s;tood it to be the intention of Gen. Heath they &s;hould be &s;eperately enquired into. Enough has appeared to &s;hew how the &s;y&s;tem of per&s;ecution was pre|&s;erved, and I come now to the tran&s;actions of the 8th of January.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="016139_0037_0F9B780807C64BA0">Upon a general view of that black day, I am at a lo&s;s where fir&s;t to carry your ob&s;ervation.&mdash;The field was ex|ten&s;ive, the &s;cenes &s;eperate and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive, but evidently gui|ded by one uniform de&s;ign &mdash; In one place a party on the march are &s;tabbing and knocking out the brains of inoffen|&s;ive &s;pectators&mdash;at another men under pretence of a pri&s;oner's e&s;cape, are glutting the &s;ame bloody purpo&s;es upon men not pretended to be concerned&mdash;in athird Col. Henley in per&s;on (the Briti&s;h officers at the &s;ame time being deni|ed admittance, as appears by the evidence of Lieut. Bibby) is running men through the body with his &s;word.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e complicated horrors in point of time, was the attack upon Traggett, fir&s;t with the bayonet and af|terwards with the butt of the firelock.&mdash;I will read the evi|dence without a comment. (Vide the evidence in the pro|ceedings.) And I have only now to remark (it is not an unfa|vorable idea to the Continental troops) that &s;uch malicious treatment could not be upon a general &s;entiment&mdash;no body of people are &s;o barbarous unle&s;s in&s;tigated&mdash;and now is the time to call upon the learned Gentleman near me for ano|ther duty of his office, to expound to the Court the princi|ples of law re&s;pecting acce&s;&s;aries and accomplices, and to &s;ay whether a man by order, advice, example, or any other en|couragement, influencing another to do a mi&s;chievous act, is not <HI>particeps criminis</HI> at an hundred miles di&s;tance, as much as if pre&s;ent upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>The &s;tabbing of Wil&s;on follows in the cour&s;e of the evi|dence; (vide proceedings) and it appears as little comment is nece&s;&s;ary upon this as upon the former action, further than to remark that in this ca&s;e Col. Henley is found to be acce&s;|&s;ary not upon circum&s;tantial, pre&s;umptive and argumentative, but upon po&s;itive proof; for it is &s;worn the action was done within his &s;ight; that he made no attempt to prevent it; and though it &s;hould be alledged and admitted that he was at too great a di&s;tance, yet his giving no reprimand nor check to the &s;oldiers upon &s;eeing the act committed, carries as direct con|viction of approbation and encouragement, as if he had given open applau&s;e.</P>
<P>The la&s;t act to mark the thir&s;t of blood, was the &s;tabbing of Corporal Hadley, and following Winks with threats of the &s;ame fate.&mdash; It would be &s;uperfluous to expatiate upon the &s;trength of the proofs, the concurrence of witne&s;&s;es that
<PB N="39" REF="016139_0038_0F9B7808C4344758">
there was no provocation, the deliberation and the wanton|ne&s;s of the barbarity.&mdash;The intention is &s;o clear in my opini|on again&s;t the probability of doubt, that I &s;hould not touch a moment upon it, were it not that a very grave application was made to the Court, by the mo&s;t re&s;pectable authori|ty in it, to con&s;ider the nature of wounds as matters of the greate&s;t importance, and que&s;tion upon que&s;tion was put to the &s;urgeon in every ca&s;e, to find whether they were dange|rous or not. Is it po&s;&s;ible that any gentleman can mean to mea&s;ure the degree of the crime by the depth of the wound, and to argue that a man may thru&s;t a weapon into another's brea&s;t with impunity, provided he does not touch a mortal part? If this doctrine holds good, you ought to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;chools of anatomy for the education of young officers, this &s;cience of de&s;ection &s;hould be added to the &s;kill of the fen|cing ma&s;ter, to train the pupils in that nicety of touch that can feel to a hair's breadth between death and life&mdash;a &s;ort of fiddle&s;tick dexterity&mdash; that can run divi&s;ions upon veins and ar|teries, and &s;top &s;hort in tune and time to the thou&s;andth part of a &s;econd. Really Gentlemen, I am not willingly ludicrous upon this &s;ubject, but it is impo&s;&s;ible to treat &s;uch an argu|ment gravely.&mdash;I di&s;mi&s;s it to my learned neighbour with one more injunction, to &s;hew the Court in law that where a man pa&s;&s;es a &s;word with violence at another's brea&s;t, whether the wound is a mere puncture or goes to the hilt, the intentional guilt is the &s;ame. I have only one matter further to ob|&s;erve upon the cro&s;s que&s;tioning the witne&s;&s;es &mdash;It has per|haps been wi&s;hed to in&s;inuate, that at the time of the&s;e violent proceedings there was cau&s;e of apprehen&s;ion the armed troops might be &s;urrounded and overcome.&mdash;The troops them&s;elves will hardly thank their friends for this idea&mdash;what &s;hall it be alledged that the militia of America, who animated by their cau&s;e, have been &s;elf-taught the u&s;e of arms? that body where every man is &s;uppo&s;ed to be in him&s;elf an ho&s;t; &s;hall &s;uch &s;oldiers be apprehen&s;ive of dan|ger from half their number of unarmed, mercenary, mini&s;terial &s;laves&mdash;for &s;uch you know they think us&mdash;No Gentlemen I reject with you &s;o injurious a &s;uppo&s;ition&mdash;I give credit to the &s;pirit and the force of the militia&mdash;I do it &s;eriou&s;ly and upon experience&mdash;and it is upon that credit I found this propo&s;ition that it being impo&s;&s;ible the officers or &s;oldiers &s;hould be induced to acts of violence by any apprehen&s;ion

of re&s;i&s;tance;&mdash;it follows by the faire&s;t deduction, that ei|ther there was more prevalent malignity than ever appeared before in the human heart, or that the whole proceeded from direction, order, and &s;y&s;tematical plan.</P>
<P>Little more I imagine need be remarked to apply the evidence to the &s;everal di&s;tinct terms I have u&s;ed in the charge&mdash;That the whole tenor of Col Henley's conduct was heinou&s;ly criminal as an officer, will hardly be di&s;puted in a country where the principles of liberty have been &s;o deeply &s;tudied.&mdash;An army is not to be borne in a free &s;tate, but upon the principle of defence again&s;t an outward enemy, or the protection of the laws.&mdash;The officer who makes him|&s;elf the arbiter of the law is guilty of the mo&s;t &s;hameful perver&s;ion of moral duty, and his impunity would &s;carcely be thought a very comfortable pre&s;age of the growing li|berties of his country.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o &s;aid the Colonel's behaviour was unbecom|ing a man.&mdash;I will not trifle with the time or under&s;tand|ing of the Court to enter into difinitions upon this term; nor will I &s;hock the ears of officers nor even of the unfor|tunate per&s;on under trial, with &s;o gro&s;s a term as the world in general apply to the act of a&s;&s;aulting a woman, a prie&s;t, or an unarmed man, for they are all exactly in the &s;ame predicament.</P>
<P>The &s;word drawn for &s;uch a purpo&s;e is no longer the badge and di&s;tinction of a Gentleman; it is degraded with the implements of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in and hangman, and contracts a &s;tain that can never be wiped away.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have now gone through the material parts of the proceedings, whether the offences are re&s;olved into vindictive re&s;entment, or more deep de&s;igns, or both, it mu&s;t &s;till appear wonderful, that general ma&s;&s;acre did not en&s;ue&mdash;by the patience and di&s;cipline of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers tho&s;e horrors have been avoided&mdash;but whatever the e&s;cape may have been on our part, it is ten-fold more material on your's&mdash;we might <HI>perhaps</HI> for the &s;truggles of the de&s;|perate are hard&mdash;but <HI>perhaps</HI> we might have been &s;acrifi|ced to the la&s;t man, we &s;hould thus have paid a &s;oldiers debt, which we have often ri&s;ked, our fall would have been revenged, and our memories attended with pity and with honor&mdash;but for America, the tran&s;action would have re|mained a foul and indeliable blot in the fir&s;t page of her

<P>Now Gentlemen, con&s;ider the words of the order un|der which you &s;it; reform the opinion of the Court of In|quiry; and &s;ay whether it is the honor of Col.

<P>I SHALL not now trouble the Court with any ob&s;ervati|ons on the evidence, becau&s;e at this &s;tage of the trial they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be partial. After the examination of the witne&s;&s;es on the &s;ide of Col. Henley is fini&s;hed, I &s;hall endeavor to lay before the Court a true &s;tate of facts, from a general and aggregate view of the whole evidence; and at the &s;ame time &s;ubmit to your con&s;ideration tho&s;e remarks which may conduce to elucidate and confirm them.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent I only renew my objection to Gen. Burgoyne's ob&s;erving upon the evidence in defence. It is true I did not until this morning, directly oppo&s;e the General's claim, which is therefore called an agreement to it; if it was &s;uch, it mu&s;t have been an agreement &s;ubject to the opinion of the Court. It was not made a point of, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed off <HI>&s;ub &s;ilentio.</HI> The precedent, if it becomes one in this cau&s;e may hereafter be con&s;idered an important one; my duty there|fore requires me to take the judgment of the Court upon the right now &s;et up. I do not pre&s;s the General upon a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the que&s;tion to day. Any hour previous to clo&s;ing the evidence may do as well.</P>

<P>Q. Was you pre&s;ent with Col. Henley at the guard-hou&s;e on Pro&s;pect-Hill 19th December la&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I was pre&s;ent the day that the Colonel wounded Cor|poral Reeves at the guard-hou&s;e; the day of the month I do not remember. On the forenoon of the day I attended Col. Henley to the guard-hou&s;e, with a de&s;ign of enquiring into the offences of a number of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers confined there. Previous to this &s;tep I had acquainted Col. Henley with General Heath's orders, which were to relea&s;e tho&s;e pri&s;oners who&s;e crimes were trifling: tho&s;e who had in&s;ul|ted any inhabitant and refu&s;ed making any atonement for the affront were to be &s;ent on board a guard-&s;hip. When we came to the guard-hou&s;e the pri&s;oners were ordered out and paraded. I examined the charges of each, and finding Buchannan and Reeves, who &s;tood together, were confined (Buchannan for in&s;ulting and &s;triking an inhabitant, Reeves for in&s;ulting an officer;) we pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e two over as not &s;ubjects of relea&s;ement After learning the other pri&s;oners offences, Reeves was called upon to relate how he got into confinement. He mentioned the circum&s;tances, and clo&s;ed his narrative by repeating a low and very abu&s;ive expre&s;&s;ion, which he had made u&s;e of to the officer who confined him; on which I told him he was an impertinent ra&s;cal for treat|ing any per&s;on with &s;uch language: He reply'd he was no more a ra&s;cal than I was, that he was a good &s;oldier. On this I order'd &s;ilence, and threatened if he did not &s;top his impertinence I would lay him over the head with my whip.
<PB N="43" REF="016139_0042_0F9B780CA82436F0">
He kept on his talk and Col. Henley di&s;mounted his hor&s;e, after bidding the fellow be &s;ilent to no purpo&s;e, tock a fire|lock with a bayonet from one of the guard, and told Reeves if he &s;aid another word he would run him through; Reeves replied he might do it if he plea&s;ed; upon this Col. Henley made a lunge at him and prick'd him in the brea&s;t. Reeves continuing his in&s;olent language, Col. Henley &s;tep'd back and made a motion to cock the firelock, and told him if he was not &s;ilent he would blow his brains out. One of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers finding Reeves was not to be &s;ilenced, begged of the Colonel to return him to the guard-hou&s;e. Buchannan and the other Briti&s;h &s;oldiers begged the Colo|nel not to take notice of the affair for Reeves was drunk; on this Reeves damn'd them and &s;aid he was not drunk He was ordered into the guard-hou&s;e. I do not remember that much &s;wearing pa&s;&s;ed, nor can I recollect the words of in&s;o|lence u&s;ed by Reeves. After Col. Henley had prick'd him, Reeves &s;aid he was a good &s;oldier and he would fight for his king and country as long as he had breath and hoped that he &s;hould &s;oon be with Gen. Howe that he might &s;eek revenge.</P>
<P>Q. Did it appear to you that Col. Henley's intention in making the pa&s;s at Reeves was to injure or to frighten him into &s;ilence?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Only to &s;ilence him; for had the Colonel extended his arm he might have run him through with the bayonet.</P>
<P>Q. By Gen. Burgoyne.&mdash;Did you hear Col. Henley or|der any of the guard to run Reeves through the body before he di&s;mounted from his hor&s;e?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I did not; but he might have done it.</P>
<P>Q In what po&s;ition was Col. Henley when he made the pa&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He had his right hand on the butt of the firelock, and the left gra&s;ping the &s;tock.</P>
<P>Q. Did you hear Reeves apologize to Col. Henley for in&s;ulting the officer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He &s;aid he did not know him to be an officer.</P>

<P>Q. DID you &s;ee Colonel Henley at the guard-hou&s;e on pro&s;pect-hill 19th December la&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I did; I had the command of the guard that day. Col. Henley and Major Swa&s;ey came to the guard-hou&s;e and enquired what number of pri&s;oners I had in cu&s;tody, and ordered them paraded; they were accordingly drawn up in a &s;ingle line, Reeves was on the right and Buchannan next to him. The Colonel mildly asked the pri&s;oners why they would get into difficulties? I handed the charges again&s;t them to Major Swa&s;ey, and as he read over their names and offences, the Colonel &s;poke to each one upon the &s;ubject of his confinement. When he came to Reeves he ob&s;erved to him that he was the lad who abu&s;ed the officer down in town; Reeves &s;aid he did not know him to be an officer at the time. Major Swa&s;ey told him that if he had been the officer, he
<PB N="45" REF="016139_0044_0F9B78111D1FCF80">
&s;hould have taken his &s;atisfaction on the &s;pot. Col. Henley then told Reeves he was a ra&s;cal; Reeves replied I am no ra&s;cal but a tree Briton, and by God I will &s;tand up for my king and country 'till I die. The Colonel told him he was a good fellow to &s;tand up for his king and country, that he did not blame him, but he mu&s;t be &s;ilent. Reeves kept on talking; the Colonel ordered &s;ilence, and turned to Buchannan. The Major went on to read his crime, and Buchannan was making an excu&s;e for his conduct; Reeves continued talking and &s;wearing, and turned round to Buchannan and &s;aid damn you why don't you &s;tand up for your king and country; Buchannan de&s;ired him to be qui|et; Reeves an&s;wered God damn them all, I'll &s;tand up for my king and country while I have life; if I had my arms I would &s;oon be with Gen. Howe, and be revenged on them. Upon this Col. Henley got from his hor&s;e and took a gun from one of the guard with a fixed bayonet, and brought it up towards Reeves's brea&s;t, and made a pu&s;h at him, and &s;aid you ra&s;cal if you don't hold your tongue I will run the bayonet through you; Reeves &s;tepped one foot back, and &s;aid he would &s;tand up for his king and country, and if you have a mind to kill me you may. The Colonel brought up the piece again, and Reeves repeating the &s;ame words, the Colonel exclaim'd God damn your king and country, if you do not hold your tongue I will run you through the body: Buchannan then took hold of the mu&s;|quet, and Col. Henley bid him keep his di&s;tance. Finding Reeves was not to be quieted, I de&s;ired the Colonel to re|commit him, and he was remanded to the guard-hou&s;e. Af|ter he was in the guard-hou&s;e, he looked out of the window and kept talking and &s;wearing while Col. Henley was ad|dre&s;&s;ing the other pri&s;oners.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> He did.</P>

<P><PB N="46" REF="016139_0045_0F9B78125BD07FA8"><HI>A.</HI> Yes; he mildly cautioned them, and told Buchannan he would relea&s;e him after he had wrote to the inhabitant who bad been abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Q. If Reeves had not &s;tept back do you think the bayo|net would have gone into his body?</P>

<P>Q. By General Burgoyne.&mdash;Is it u&s;ual in the American &s;ervice to &s;ilence men by the &s;word and bayonet?</P>

<P>Q. Was you at the guard-hou&s;e on 19th of December la&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I was. The witne&s;s confirms the te&s;timony of Capt. Wild, as to the pri&s;oners being paraded, and &s;ays that when Col. Henley a&s;ked Reeves what he was confined for, Reeves replied he was confined for talking &s;aucy to a Lieutenant, but did not at the time know him to be an officer. Col. Henley inquired what the abu&s;e was; Reeves an&s;wered that if he mu&s;t tell, he mu&s;t&mdash;"That he was walking along with a comrade, who told him that King Hancock was come to town, upon which I &s;aid don't you think him an impudent fellow for coming &s;o near Gen. Burgoyne. A Continental officer a&s;ked me what it was I &s;aid, I replied if you want any thing of me here is my pa&s;s. The officer told me I had better not talk &s;o &s;aucy, and I bid him ki&s;s my ar&s;e." Upon hearing this account, Major Swa&s;ey told Reeves that if he had given him &s;uch a reply he would have &s;ettled it with him on the &s;pot, and not &s;ent for a file of men&mdash;Col. Henley added &s;o would I you ra&s;cal Reeves an&s;wered he was no ra&s;cal; the Colonel told him he was one; Reeves then &s;aid if I am a ra&s;cal, you are a damn'd ra&s;cal. Upon this Col. Henley got off his hor&s;e, took a firelock from one of the guard, and bid Reeves be &s;ilent, and came up to him with the fixed bayonet&mdash;Reeves bared his brea&s;t and told the Colonel that his life was at &s;take, and he might take it. Upon this the Colonel prick'd him with the bayo|net,

<P><PB N="51" REF="016139_0050_0F9B78166B953230"><HI>A.</HI> I was; as we marched along towards the fort on Pro&s;pect-hill, the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers crowded much upon us, &s;o as not to give us elbow-room; it was very muddy; our &s;erjeant &s;poke to the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers and de&s;ired them to give way for us to pa&s;s, but they crowded clo&s;e upon us; a Briti&s;h &s;oldier then de&s;ired them to move back, upon which one of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers &s;aid damn the yankies; upon that our &s;erjeant a&s;ked him what he &s;aid, and he repeated damn the yankies; with that the &s;erjeant made a pu&s;h at him, whether he wounded him or not I can't &s;ay, but the man cried out. The &s;erjeant then clubb'd his firelock, and the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers crowding in, he made a &s;troke at the &s;ame man, but did not &s;trike him I am certain, I was quite clo&s;e to him all the time; we marched on.</P>
<P>Q. Were you interrupted or impeded by the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We were; for they crowded &s;o upon us as to break our ranks &s;everal times.</P>
<P>Q. Were you in&s;ulted by the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They crowded &s;o upon us that they forced us into the mud and water, and would not give way?</P>
<P>Q. Did they laugh at or hoot at the guard?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They did laugh at us.</P>
<P>Q. How many Briti&s;h &s;oldiers were round you?</P>
<P><HI>A</HI> Four or five hundred.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;ee any Briti&s;h &s;oldier with a club or other weapon in his hand?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I did not.</P>
<P>John Ander&s;on of the militia.</P>
<P>Q. Was you one of the detachment &s;ent to Pro&s;pect hill on the 8th January?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I was. The witne&s;s confirms the evidence of Duck|ingfield, except that he did not hear the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers &s;ay damn the yankies. They made u&s;e of the words damn, but who they damn'd he can't tell; he was within three feet of the &s;erjeant when he made the pa&s;s at the Briti&s;h &s;oldier. The witne&s;s gives the &s;ame an&s;wer in &s;ub&s;tance to the que&s;tions put to the la&s;t witne&s;s, except that there were in his opinion between two and three hundred Briti&s;h &s;oldiers around the party.</P>

<P><PB N="52" REF="016139_0051_0F9B781A45951B90"><HI>A.</HI> On the 8th January an order came for Col. Gerri&s;h to furni&s;h a detachment of 100 men from his regiment, which was made, and the command given to me, with verbal orders to reinforce the main guard on Pro&s;pect-hill. We marched on, my&s;elf at the head of the party, and during the march I &s;aw no in&s;ult, I looked directly forward. When we came a-brea&s;t of the barracks, the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers turn|ed out generally. As we marched on they followed. In the front I &s;aw no in&s;ult offered by the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers; how it was in the rear I cannot &s;ay, but I had no report of any at the time of the march. Ju&s;t before I came up to the barracks, I halted the men, in order to clo&s;e and cover properly; and then gave orders that they gave no in&s;ult nor received any?</P>

<P>Q. WAS you one of the guard who had a Briti&s;h &s;oldier in cu&s;tody, carrying him to the guard-hou&s;e on the 8th January?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I was; in the forenoon orders came to the &s;erjeant of our guard to furni&s;h a file of men and a corporal to take charge of a Briti&s;h &s;oldier, of which I was one; we took him at the bridge ju&s;t below the provi&s;ion hou&s;e. Col. Henley when we took charge of the pri&s;oner was by, and gave us orders if any man attempted to re&s;cue him, to fire upon them. We marched on with him, (his name was Buchannan) he told us he had done nothing more than hav|ing a pa&s;s that was not his own, that he &s;hould not be pun|i&s;hed, and that one of us wou'd be &s;ufficient to guard him. Ju&s;t as we got within the works behind the barracks, where there was a con&s;iderable number of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers collect|ed; a Briti&s;h &s;oldier came up to us upon the run&punc; I told him to keep off, he muttered &s;omething and told me if I did not mind he would take my firelock from me. Our cor|poral told him if he did not mind how he talked he would
<PB N="53" REF="016139_0052_0F9B781B6DB6D1E0">
take care of him. On this he &s;tepped a&s;ide and walked along with us talking with Buchannan upon the &s;ubject of his con|finement; as we went along we came up to a crowd of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, I &s;hould think three or four hundred of them; our corporal ordered them to make way, which they refu&s;ed to do, and &s;tood &s;o thick together that we could hardly tell which the pri&s;oner was. The pri&s;oner &s;tep'd out and another Briti&s;h &s;oldier &s;tep'd in, took hold of Bu|channan's arm, and placed him&s;elf between me &amp; Buchannan who went off with the crowd; our corporal turning round and &s;eeing Buchannan gone &s;tep'd in among the Briti&s;h &s;ol|diers to recover Buchannan; the &s;ame Briti&s;h &s;oldier who had taken hold of Buchannan's arm, took hold of the cor|poral and &s;top'd him; upon this I brought my piece down and prick'd the &s;oldier who had hold of the corporal be|tween the hip and the ribbs. The &s;oldier then let go the Corporal's arm, and we marched on to the main-guard without our pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Q. Did the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers refu&s;e by words or actions to make way for the guard to pa&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By actions; I mean they did not move out of the way; they talked, but I don't recollect what they &s;aid.</P>
<P>Q. After Buchannan had e&s;caped from the guard did the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers &s;hew any marks of triumph?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; they laugh'd and huzza'd a good deal.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know the name of the per&s;on whom you pricked?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I do not</P>
<P>Q. Do you think you run the Briti&s;h &s;oldier into the body?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I imagine I did, for I pu&s;h'd with a good will, and he cried out God damn you.</P>
<P>Thomas Lewis of the militia.</P>
<P>Q. Was you one of the guard who had the cu&s;tody of a Briti&s;h &s;oldier on the 8th January?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I was. The witne&s;s confirms the &s;ub&s;tance of Peirce's te&s;timony, except that he did not &s;ee a Briti&s;h &s;ol|dier take hold of Buchannan nor the corporal</P>
<P>Q. Might a Briti&s;h &s;oldier have taken hold of Buchan|nan or the corporal, and you not &s;ee it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; for upon Buchannan's &s;tepping out I turned round to keep the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers off on the other &s;ide of us,
<PB N="54" REF="016139_0053_0F9B781CB7282DA0">
and hearing a Briti&s;h &s;oldier cry out I turned back and &s;aw Peirce pulling back his bayonet from the &s;ide of a Briti&s;h &s;oldier.</P>
<P>Q. Did it appear to you that the pri&s;oner (Buchannan) was forced away by the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, or that he run away him&s;elf?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I can't &s;ay, for it was done very quick; Buchannan &s;tarted before I turned round.</P>
<P>Q. After Buchannan had got away did the Briti&s;h &s;oldi|ers &s;hew marks of triumph?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They &s;houted and huzza'd.</P>

<P>It is conceded by Gen. Burgoyne that on the evening of the 7th of January, a provincial &s;entry was knock'd down on his po&s;t by a Briti&s;h &s;oldier; that he was much beat, and his gun taken from him.</P>
<P>Col. Gerri&s;h of the militia.]</P>
<P>Q. Do you know any thing of a Provincial &s;entry being knocked down on his po&s;t on the evening of 7th January, and what tran&s;actions en&s;ued?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the evening of 7th of January, a me&s;&s;enger came to me at Winter-hill, where my regiment is po&s;ted, and ac|quainted me that a &s;entry had been knocked down on his po&s;t, and his gun taken from him. In con&s;equence of this report, I ordered the regiment out and detached 200 men, with two Captains as a reinforcement to the guard at the French lines on Pro&s;pect-hill, with orders to march &s;ilently and &s;urround the fir&s;t row of barracks, where I &s;uppo&s;ed the gun was car|ried in. I accompanied the detachment. The party was in two divi&s;ions, one under Capt. Hu&s;e, the other under Capt. Kimbal. I left the party under Capt. Hu&s;e in front of the fir&s;t row of barracks, and then ordered Capt. Kimbal (who had mi&s;taken my fir&s;t orders and got to a wrong &s;ituation) to join Capt, Hu&s;e; while Capt Kimbal marched to make the junction, I was left a little behind in front of the &s;econd row of barracks, a Briti&s;h &s;oldier came out and &s;aid to me, damn you what do you come here for, we have done you no hurt in the&s;e barracks: We have got arms and we will
<PB N="55" REF="016139_0054_0F9B781D049A40D0">
&s;hoot you. I then thought the &s;entry's gun might be in that barrack, and called for a &s;erjeant and a dozen men; they came up, then the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers came to the door of the barrack and pre&s;ented a weapon out (I thought it had been a mu&s;ket, tho' I afterwards found it had only been a club) and &s;aid God damn you we'll &s;hoot ye. I then ordered my &s;mall party to fire upon them, but upon the party's cocking I re-called the order, as the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers in the room might not all be guilty, and &s;ome of my own men might be endangered who were in the rear of the barrack. We then approached clo&s;e to the door and found that they were not guns which the &s;oldiers in the room had in their hands. One of them as we approached made a &s;troke at us with a &s;tick, but did not hit either of us; as he was making another pa&s;s I &s;truck him down, and we entered the barrack and took five or &s;ix of tho&s;e in the room and &s;ent them off to the main-guard. I then got a candle and &s;earch'd the room, found no arms, but a number of hickery-&s;ticks, &s;horter and &s;touter than walking &s;ticks. When the &s;earch was over, one of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers catched at the candle and put it out and followed us to the other barrack, where he was in&s;olent and &s;aucy, and I thought proper to &s;end him to the guard-hou&s;e. I then gave orders to the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers that they &s;hould not leave the barracks 'till the barracks were &s;earched, telling them they &s;hould not be mole&s;ted by my men. I then &s;earch'd the barracks where I &s;uppo&s;ed the gun was carried in; they were loth the barracks &s;hould be &s;earched, and refu&s;ed giving me any direct an&s;wers; they were in&s;o|lent and kept damning of us, &s;everal of them called us damn'd rebels and yankies &s;everal times; this gave me &s;trong rea&s;ons of &s;u&s;picion that the gun was &s;ecreted among them, and I therefore thought proper to &s;end the greater part of tho&s;e in that room to the main-guard. I then went on and &s;earched &s;everal rooms in the &s;ame row of barracks, and met with no oppo&s;ition or in&s;ult. Finding the &s;earch fruitle&s;s, I returned with my detachment to Winter-hill, ex|cept a party I left to reinforce the guard at the French lines.</P>

<P>Q. Was you with Col. Gerri&s;h on the evening of 7th January, when the barracks on Pro&s;pect-hill were &s;earched by him?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> After the detachment had got down to the barracks as hath been related, Col. Gerri&s;h gave orders to a corpo|ral and four men to go in and &s;earch the rooms: I was one of the four. We &s;earched &s;everal rooms in the mo&s;t northerly row of the barracks, and met with no re&s;i&s;tance from the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers. We then went to the barracks in the row below. When we came to the door of the room intended to be &s;earched, &s;ome one in the room called out to the re&s;t to fire; a weapon was pre&s;ented out of the door, whether it was a gun or a &s;tick I can't &s;ay; the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers &s;aid they would defend their own room. On this Col. Gerri&s;h ordered Lieut. Searle to fire upon them, but pre&s;ently re|called the word: Four or five of us then ru&s;hed in among them, they were armed with clubs, we turned them out of the room, and one of them made a &s;troke at Lieut. Searle, which he parry'd with his gun, Lieut. Searle then knocked three or four of them down with his gun: We had then or|ders to take five of them to the guard-hou&s;e, one without
<PB N="57" REF="016139_0056_0F9B781E85A0A0C8">
his breeches. The Briti&s;h &s;oldiers were in&s;olent and &s;aid to us damn your bloods, you &s;hall not come in; and the fir&s;t that does we'll knock him down. I did not hear any ex|pre&s;&s;ions of yankies or rebels. In another room into which I went with a Lieutenant, as &s;oon as we entered the door a Briti&s;h &s;oldier blew out the light they had in the room; the Lieut. &s;eized the man by the collar who blew out the candle, and brought him out of the room with &s;ome difficulty, and a&s;ked him for the candle, which he denied to have &s;een or touched, an officer of ours put his hand into his pocket and took it out, and then the Captain &s;truck him, then the Ad|jutant, and then the Colonel, who call'd him ra&s;cal for de|nying his having the candle, and ordered him under guard. We went to &s;everal other rooms, where the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers held the light for us, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted us in &s;earching the room; the &s;earch was fruitle&s;s, for we could not find the gun.</P>
<P>Q. Was there any fire-arms in any of the rooms you &s;earched?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> There was not; in one room they had clubs, I mean hickery &s;ticks, three or four feet long, and near as thick as my wri&s;t.</P>
<P>Q. When you ru&s;h'd into the room did the Briti&s;h &s;ol|diers &s;trike at you with their clubs; and how many Briti&s;h &s;oldiers were in the room?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> There were about 16 or 18 &s;oldiers in the room, and they did not &s;trike at us when we went into the room.</P>
<P>Q. Was there time for the man who was without his breeches to have put them on if he cho&s;e it before he was carried off by the guard?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> There was; &s;everal of the others went in and put on their &s;tockings. This man was &s;ulkey, and I &s;uppo&s;e he meant to knock &s;ome of us down before he put his breeches on, as he came out of the room with his club.</P>

<P>Q. Did you make any report to Col. Henley on the morning of the 8th January?</P>

<P>Q. By Col. Henley.&mdash;Had you orders to get your regi|ment under arms?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The regiment were, I believe, got under arms imme|diately, and &s;oon after di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; but I was not with them.</P>
<P>Col. Gerri&s;h.&mdash;I was at Col. Henley's on the morning of the 8th January, and as I came along I &s;aw Col. Brooks's regiment upon the common under arms; I was told that a hundred men had been ordered from my regiment, I a&s;k'd the rea&s;on, 'twas an&s;wered&mdash;there were two of our men kil|led, I reply'd I believe it is a fal&s;e report, for I had been on the Hill that morning and had heard nothing of it; upon that Col. Brooks's regiment was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Col Henley immediately went to Pro&s;pect-hill&mdash;&s;oon after I went to the Hill my&s;elf, as I was officer of the day.&mdash;When I entered the fort on Pro&s;pect-hill I &s;aw Col. Henley with the rein|forcement from my regiment; Col. Henley told me the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers had re&s;cued a pri&s;oner from our guard; I then went in front of the detachment from my regiment with Col. Henley, I &s;aw about a hundred Briti&s;h &s;oldiers front of the detachment, between it and the barracks, the di&s;tance was &s;o &s;mall between the detachment and barracks, that 'twas difficult pa&s;&s;ing without interruption on account of their being in front; I apprehend about 200 more Briti&s;h &s;oldi|diers were di&s;per&s;ed about, particularly in the rear of the detachment. I think I told Col. Henley if I had the com|mand I &s;hould order them to di&s;per&s;e, as I did not look on the guard &s;afe; I thought they might di&s;arm his guard if they &s;hould ru&s;h upon them. I went immediately into the citadel, and &s;aw nothing further. When I came out of the citadel into the fort again, I &s;aw Col. Henley marching off the Hill with the detachment and the pri&s;oners; as they were marching off, a number of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers &s;tanding to|gether &s;aid, I wonder what the damn'd Yankies are going to do now.</P>
<P>Q. When Col. Henley conver&s;ed with you, did any of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers come clo&s;e up and li&s;ten to what was &s;aid?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They did; We moved a little farther and they fol|lowed us with a view, as I thought, of hearing the conver&s;a|tion. I don't recollect Col. Henley's &s;aying any thing to them about it.</P>

<P>Q. Did the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers crowd &s;o much upon the de|tachment as to prevent the execution of any orders which Col. Henley might give?</P>

<P>Q. Did you &s;ee Col. Henley on Pro&s;pect-hill on the forenoon of the 8th January?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I did; I was the Captain of the guard on the Hill that day, and had in cu&s;tody twenty-nine Briti&s;h &s;oldiers. About 11 o'clock Col. Henley and Major Swa&s;ey came up to the guard-hou&s;e, and after &s;ome inquiries, and my reporting that every thing was very quiet, Col Henley told me that a reinforcement was coming up, and he thought it would be be&s;t to take the pri&s;oners out of the guard-hou&s;e, and &s;end them to Cambridge, where an enquiry could be&s;t be made into their crimes. We went into the guard-hou&s;e to|gether, and pre&s;ently the detachment came into the citadel, and formed about four rods from the guard-hou&s;e. At this time I &s;aw a large number of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers collecting near a corner of the guard hou&s;e. I went with Col. Henley's orders to bid them di&s;per&s;e and retire to their barracks, he ordered them two or three times, finding they would not obey him, he called twelve men from the detachment. After &s;ome time the twelve men moved from the party, up|on which the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers gave a &s;hout and di&s;per&s;ed, going off towards their barracks. Immediately on this, a man came up and told Col. Henley that a pri&s;oner had been
<PB N="60" REF="016139_0059_0F9B775F5FF70B60">
re&s;cued from him by the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers. Col. Henley on this &s;aid he would take the command him&s;elf; and then marched the detachment out of the citadel and paraded them in the rear of the barracks in the fort. I know of no tran&s;|actions while the detachment were in the fort, for as Cap|tain of the main-guard I could not quit my po&s;t at &s;uch a time.</P>
<P>Q. What was the number of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers who were a&s;&s;embled near the corner of the guard-hou&s;e?</P>

<P>Q. Was there any in&s;ult offered to Col. Henley by the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not per&s;onally to Col. Henley; but they were laughing and jeering at the guard; &s;ome of them cried out Yankies, but I can't be particular in their expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Q. By Gen. Burgoyne.&mdash;Was there any appearance of an a&s;&s;ault on the part of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; they appeared to me rather with a view of in|&s;ulting than a&s;&s;aulting the guard; they pointed at and laugh|ed at the guard; they were talking but I did not hear their expre&s;&s;ions; there was a brea&s;t-work between the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers and the detachment, over which they were looking at the detachment</P>

<P>Q. DO you know any thing of corporal Buchannan a Briti&s;h &s;oldier, being taken into cu&s;tody on the 8th January, and his being re&s;cued from the guard who had charge of him?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> On the morning of the 8th January I was accompa|nying Col. Henley to Pro&s;pect-hill. At the bridge on the
<PB N="61" REF="016139_0060_0F9B775C59C75D80">
road to Pro&s;pect-hill the &s;entry was examining a pa&s;s &s;hewed hint by corporal Buchannan; Col. Henley &s;u&s;pecting the pa&s;s might be forged, ordered Buchannan to &s;hew it to him, with much reluctance be gave it to Col. Henley; the name of another man in&s;erted in it; in con&s;equence of this di&s;co|very Col. Henley ordered a file of men to take charge of him: As there had been frequent re&s;cues before, Col. Hen|ley ordered the guard in ca&s;e any Briti&s;h &s;oldiers &s;hould at|tempt to re&s;cue him out of their hands to fire upon them. I then went on with Col. Henley to the guard-hou&s;e on Pro&s;pect-hill Soon after we got upon the hill a detachment which had been ordered up to take charge of &s;ome pri&s;oners in the main-guard arrived; after the detachment had paraded near the guard-hou&s;e, a large body of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers appeared near the brea&s;t-work who were ordered to their barrack by an officer, and then by Col. Henley; they appeared to move &s;lowly off At this time I &s;tep'd up to the brea&s;t-work, and ob&s;erved Buchannan coming up with the guard; the guard had got into a crowd of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, and I ob&s;er|ved a Briti&s;h &s;oldier hold of the &s;kirts of the coat of one of the guard, and heard &s;ome among&s;t the crowd cry out, run damn you run, and &s;aw Buchannan running through the crowd of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers: one of the guard pur&s;uing him with a charg'd bayonet, was intercepted by the crowd, and I &s;aw no more of Buchannan. Immediately on this Col. Henley ordered the whole of the detachment to march out of the fort, and we went out of the fort together, and Col. Henley a&s;ked me what mea&s;ures he &s;hould take to recover Buchannan? I ob&s;erved to him the be&s;t way would be to ac|quaint the Briti&s;h commanding-officer of the day of it, and did not doubt he would give Buchannan up. Col. Henley then de&s;ired me to wait on the commanding-officer and ac|quaint him with the matter; I accordingly weired on Major Fo&s;ter of the 21&s;t regiment, and on acquainting him with the matter, the Major told me he would &s;end for the Ad|jutant of the regiment and order him confined, and report the matter to the Brigadier. In &s;ix or &s;even minutes I re|turned to Col. Henley and reported Major Fo&s;ter's an&s;wer, with which he &s;eemed perfectly &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Q What number of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers were a&s;&s;embled at the time Buchannan was re&s;cued?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I imagine one hundred and fifty, within a circle of one hundred yards.</P>

<P>Q. Did you &s;ee Col. Henley with a detachment of &s;ol|diers on Pro&s;pect-hill, on the 8th January la&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I was at the guard-hou&s;e on Pro&s;pect-hill, on the forenoon of the 8th January, when Col. Henley and Ma|jor Swa&s;ey rode up, and &s;oon after a detachment came up and were paraded near the guard hou&s;e; at this time a number of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers made their appearance out-&s;ide the brea&s;t-work, near the guard-hou&s;e; orders were repeatedly given to them by the Captain of the guard and by Col. Henley to di&s;per&s;e, which they paid little regard to. There were about one hundred at the bread-work,and more were coming up; at this time I &s;aw two or three of our men armed, coming through the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers; Col. Henley called out for a dozen men, upon which the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers gave a &s;hout and moved towards the barracks, and on their way ru&s;hed between the two or three armed men before-mentioned, and there was a &s;cuffle among them as they cleared away; I &s;up|po&s;e a Briti&s;h &s;oldier by his clapping his hand near his hip, was wounded. Col. Henley &s;oon marched out with the de|tachment, and paraded them in the rear of the barracks; I followed and &s;tood in the rear of the guard near the centre. As &s;oon as the detachment halted the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers ga|thered round in front and rear of the detachment, to the amount of upwards of two hundred. On this Col. Henley ordered twelve men on the right to prime and load, and then wheeled them to the left &s;o as to form an angle. Col. Hen|ley then turned towards the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers and &s;aid that he had had one pri&s;oner re&s;cued, and if they offered to re&s;cue any more he would order his guard to fire upon them. Col. Henley a&s;ked for Major Swa&s;ey, and &s;eeing Col. Gerri&s;h on hor&s;e-back, he &s;tepped up to him, two or three Briti&s;h &s;ol|diers followed him and &s;tood at two or three yards di&s;tance li&s;tening (to appearance) to what was &s;aid by Col. Henley and Col. Gerri&s;h. Col. Henley then ordered a divi&s;ion from the left of the detachment to go into the citadel and bring out &s;ome pri&s;oners; they marched off accordingly, and were about one fourth of the whole detachment. Col. Henley then di&s;po&s;ed his men to receive the pri&s;oners which might be brought; by this time the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers had collected in &s;uch numbers, that the Colonel had hardly room to pa&s;s in front of his guard; Col. Henley then addre&s;&s;ed the Briti&s;h
<PB N="63" REF="016139_0062_0F9B775E87D7D3E8">
&s;oldiers, and ordered them to di&s;per&s;e and go their barracks, &s;ome few turned round, Col. Henley repeated his orders and &s;aid begone to your barracks every one of you; &s;ome others then turned round and moved &s;lowly, Col. Henley on their moving &s;lowly, cry'd God damn you why don't you move, and made a lunge with his &s;word at a Briti&s;h &s;oldier, which I imagine &s;truck him, as I ob&s;erved the &s;word was bent, and &s;aw the Colonel endeavor to &s;traighten it. They then moved off, and the men returned from the guard-hou&s;e with the Briti&s;h pri&s;oners, and the whole detachment march|ed off the hill with them.</P>
<P>Q. Did you hear any Briti&s;h &s;oldier &s;ay any thing to Col. Henley during any of the time you have &s;poken of?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I did not; there was a buzzing among&s;t them, but I can't repeat any expre&s;&s;ion they u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Q. Had any of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers any weapons in their hands?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not that I &s;aw.</P>
<P>Q. Did you ob&s;erve any circum&s;tance to prevent Col. Henley from taking any of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers pri&s;oners had he thought proper?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He might have taken the man pri&s;oner whom he &s;truck at with the &s;word.</P>
<P>Q. Might he not have taken any other man pri&s;oner?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He might have taken a &s;ingle man; it might have been dangerous taking more.</P>
<P>Q. Was the man Col. Henley made the lunge at moving off at the time?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I think he was not; he &s;tood with his face towards the guard, at the di&s;tance of a yard or two.</P>
<P>Q. What did Col. Henley do after making the lunge you have mentioned?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He turned round and walked in the front of his guard towards the right, and &s;poke to a Briti&s;h &s;oldier who was walking very &s;lowly in front of the guard, and bid him go along immediately, he repeated the order, the &s;oldier did not in the lea&s;t quicken his pace; Col. Henley followed him a little way and then turned round; the Briti&s;h &s;oldi|er attempted to pa&s;s the &s;erjeant who &s;tood on the right of the guard, the &s;erjeant pu&s;h'd him off the bank.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;ee Col. Henley make a pa&s;s at this la&s;t &s;ol|dier you have mentioned?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I did not.</P>

<P>Serjeant Samuel Humphreys.]</P>
<P>Q. Was you on the detachment on Pro&s;pect-hill on the 8th January, when Col. Henley was pre&s;ent?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I was; after the detachment got into the citadel and were paraded I ob&s;erved a number of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers look|ing over the brea&s;t-work; Col. Henley ordered them to di&s;per&s;e, they did not &s;eem to move, he ordered them a &s;econd time, they did not move, Col. Henley turned round and ordered twelve men to advance, I was one of the twelve, we advanced out to the &s;ally-port, Col. Henley or|dered us to go on, the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers &s;eeing us advance &s;cattered &s;lowly; &s;oon after Col. Henley came up and ad|vanced with us to the rear of the barrack, we were there paraded with the re&s;t of the detachment; Col. Henley or|dered twelve men to load, he then &s;aid he had had one pri|&s;oner re&s;cu&s;ed, and determined not to have another, and ordered the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers to di&s;per&s;e, they moved very &s;lowly, he walked along the guard and back again, and &s;aid to two of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers damn you do you want to be run through, and bid them be gone, and turned round, one of the Briti&s;h &s;aid he'd be damn'd if he was in any hurry, I don't know that the Colonel heard him; the two &s;oldiers went on &s;lowly, and when they came to the right of the detachment, they attempted to crowd by the &s;erjeant who pu&s;h'd them both over the bank, they got up and damn'd the &s;erjeant, and look'd black and &s;our as the devil at him; I did not &s;ee Col. Henley &s;tab a Briti&s;h &s;oldier, I &s;tood &s;o far on the right that I could not &s;ee all that pa&s;&s;ed; the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers did not crowd on the right of the guard, they were pretty thick on the left; I imagine upon the whole parade there might be three or four hundred Bri|ti&s;h &s;oldiers.</P>

<P>Q. Was you a Captain of the detachment on the 8th January ordered to Pro&s;pect-hill, and what took place on the arrival of the detachment within the citadel?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> After we arrived in the citadel I paraded the de|tachment on the &s;outh ca&s;t &s;ide; I &s;aw Col. Henley and
<PB N="65" REF="016139_0064_0F9B7760C9B71B38">
Capt. Brooks going towards the North-we&s;t part, where a number of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers were a&s;&s;embled; Col. Henley had his &s;word in his hand and drawn, he repeatedly ordered them to di&s;per&s;e and immediately ordered a &s;erjeant and twelve men from my detachment; &s;oon after the twelve men had marched as I &s;uppo&s;e out of the citadel, Col. Henley came and took the command of the detachment and march|ed them out of the citadel, the &s;erjeant and twelve men mar|ched as a van-guard, &s;o far as to have room to parade; the twelve men formed a rank intire, and formed ah angle on the right; Col. Henley then walked up and down the front of the detachment, and immediately addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, &s;aid, you have re&s;cued one pri&s;oner, but you &s;hall not re&s;cue another, Col. Henley at this time had is &s;word drawn, but I am uncertain when he drew it, as he walked to the right where there was not &s;o many Bri|ti&s;h &s;oldiers as on the left, he a&s;ked one or two of them a que&s;tion, what it was I cannot tell, but think it imply'd do you want me to force you off; with that they went off &s;lowly, three of them than attempted to get <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;erjeant on the right, which one of them did, the &s;erjeant immedi|ately pu&s;hed the other two off the bank; about one half of the detachment there, were ordered off to bring the pri&s;on|ers from the guard-hou&s;e, the detachment was formed into an oblong &s;quare, with the pri&s;oners in the middle; during this time there were about eighty Briti&s;h &s;oldiers in the front, and about two hundred in the rear.</P>
<P>Henry Ham&s;on, &s;erjeant in the militia.]</P>
<P>Q. Was you on the detachment paraded by Col. Henley in the rear of the barracks on Pro&s;pect-hill on the 8th January la&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I was; after we were drawn up in the rear of the barracks, Col. Henley &s;ent off a party from the left of the detachment to bring out &s;ome pri&s;oners from the guard-hou&s;e in the citadel, and as Col. Henley was walking up and down the parade, the Briti&s;h troops came up thick in the front of us, Col. Henley ordered them to di&s;per&s;e and go to their barracks, they made no movement at this order; Col. Henley then moved to the left 80 or a 100 paces and looking round, found they had not moved, came back again and ordered them to go off; on this they turned and began moving very &s;lowly, Col. Henley pu&s;hed his &s;word at

them, but whether he wounded any one I can't &s;ay, one of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers turned to the left and came down in the rear of me and &s;aid, damn your eyes you buggers, you &s;hall pay for this one of the&s;e days, and went off.</P>
<P>Q. What number of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers were round the de|tachment at the time you mention?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Upwards of three hundred.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;ee any in&s;ult either in action, word or ge&s;ture, on the parts of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, before Col. Henley made a pa&s;s at the man?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They look'd &s;ulkey and malicious; they were in front and rear of the detachment.</P>

<P>Q. DO you know that a militia &s;entinel was in&s;ulted and knocked down on his po&s;t on the evening of 15th December?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The 15th December I was one of the provi&s;ion guard near Pro&s;pect-hill, and about eight o'clock in the evening hearing a gun fired &s;tep'd out of the guard-hou&s;e
<PB N="67" REF="016139_0066_0F9B7762594DEBA8">
to enquire of the &s;entinel where the gun was fired; finding the &s;entinel &s;urrounded by five or &s;ix Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, and hearing them demand of the &s;entinel if his gun was loaded, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to order them to di&s;per&s;e, on this or|der they &s;eized the &s;entinel's firelock; I took hold of the firelock to wre&s;t it from them, they knock'd the &s;entinel down with their fi&s;t, and then knock'd me down and kick'd me &s;everal times in the face, and one &s;aid God damn him, fire him through, one of them had the gun in his hand at this time, and &s;napped the gun within four feet of my brea&s;t; a file of our men coming up, they all went off except the one who had the gun, the corporal ordered him to lay down the firelock, which be refu&s;ed, they then &s;eized him, wre&s;ted the gun from him, and carried him pri&s;oner to the guard-hou&s;e; the &s;entinel was much brui&s;ed in the face; they clo&s;ed one of my eyes by a kick, &s;o that I could not &s;ee out of it for two or three days.</P>

<P>Q. Do you know of a Briti&s;h &s;oldier being re&s;cued from your guard on or about the tenth of December?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The tenth of December I was on duty on the main-guard on Pro&s;pect-hill; on hearing from one of our men that a &s;entry had fired on &s;ome Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, I went our to enquire into it; upon coming up to the &s;entry, I found fifteen or eighteen Briti&s;h &s;oldiers round the &s;entinel; the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers were reprimanding the &s;entinel in high terms for firing on one of their men, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the chief &s;poke&s;man and de&s;ired him to go off to his barracks, he turn|ed upon me and &s;aid, "What bu&s;ine&s;s have you here you God damn clown, with a &s;word under your arm. I'll have you to know we are not pri&s;oners, but I will do as I have a mind;" I again ordered him to go to his barrack peaceably, and I would take no notice of his abu&s;e to me; he on this turned about and cry'd out, God damn you, ki&s;s my ar&s;e, and repeated it three or four times; I then ordered the &s;entry to take him into cu&s;tody, he then &s;triking his fi&s;ts together, &s;wore he'd kill the man who &s;hould offer to take him; the other &s;oldier who &s;tood by &s;aid he &s;hould not be carried to the guard-hou&s;e, they would turn out the regiment upon me fir&s;t: On the&s;e threats I call'd for a &s;erjeant of the guard; he not coming immediately. I ordered two of our guard who were coming down the hill to take the man who
<PB N="68" REF="016139_0067_0F9B776753891940">
had &s;o gro&s;ly in&s;ulted me into cu&s;tody and carry him to the guard-hou&s;e; I went with the guard half way up the hill, and returning to the &s;entinel looking back, &s;aw a number of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers round the two men who had the cu&s;tody of the Briti&s;h &s;oldier above-mentioned, I &s;aw a Briti&s;h &s;oldier running up the hill, and heard the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers cry out we have got him, on which a loud huzza was rai&s;ed by the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers in front of the barracks where the man run into; &s;ome little time after this I &s;aw the man who I had taken into cu&s;tody as above related, walking before the barrack with a number of other Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, I ordered a &s;erjeant with a file of men to go and take him, the &s;er|jeant went, the &s;oldier &s;eeing him coming &s;et out and run, and the &s;erjeant after him, the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers &s;eiz'd their comrade, pull'd him into the barrack, and pu&s;h'd the &s;er|jeant back as he was entering the barrack and &s;et up a loud huzza. All the&s;e tran&s;actions I afterwards reported to Major Gage our officer of the day, who advi&s;ed me to make application to the Briti&s;h officers, I accordingly went down and finding &s;ome of them, Major Gage related the circum|&s;tances of in&s;ult and re&s;cue before-mentioned. The Briti&s;h officer told us the men were to be paraded pre&s;ently, and if I could point out the man he &s;hould be confined. After the men were paraded I pointed out the fellow and he was ordered off the parade under guard. The next day accor|ding to notice, I attended a Briti&s;h regimental court-marti|al, with the witne&s;&s;es to &s;upport the chare again&s;t him; the man was arraigned, and I gave the court the nece&s;&s;ary in|formation and withdrew. The next day I had a line from Lieut. Col. Lind informing me with the proceedings of the court-martial, the criminal was &s;entenced to receive fifty la&s;hes, the me&s;&s;enger told me that the puni&s;ment was to be inflicted the next day at ten o'clock, and de&s;ired me to attend; the next day according to the hour appointed I at|tended, and after waiting &s;ome time, was told that the pu|ni&s;hment was deferred 'till two o'clock afternoon. I &s;taid 'till two o'clock and then &s;aw the &s;erjeant-major of the regiment, who told me the puni&s;hment was remitted, and the men &s;et at liberty. Thus ended the matter, and I ne|ver received any &s;ort of &s;atisfaction. The whole of this tran&s;action was reported to Col. Henley.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> One day the beginning of December, I came up to Cambridge with a patrole party, and was returning to the main-guard with a Briti&s;h &s;oldier in cu&s;tody, (who I had taken up for being found without a pa&s;s) carrying him to the guard-hou&s;e, when my party, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix men, came oppo&s;ite the barracks of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, near a hundred of them ru&s;h'd upon us, &s;eized hold of the pri|&s;oner and carried him off, huzzaing.

<P>THE following witne&s;&s;es were produced by Gen. Bur|goyne in invalidation of Col. Henley's, with re&s;pect to corporal Reeves.</P>

<P>Q. Was you pre&s;ent on 19th day December at the guard-hou&s;e, when Col. Henly had the difference with corporal Reeves?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I was one of the pri&s;oners, and pre&s;ent all the time, during the conver&s;ation between Col. Henley and Reeves, at about the di&s;tance of three or four yards.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="016139_0070_0F9B776A8CC85AA8">Q. Did you during any part of the conver&s;ation, hear corporal Reeves call Col. Henley a ra&s;cal, or damn him?</P>

<P><HI>Mr. Pre&s;ident and Gentlemen of the Court,</HI></P>
<P>THE evidence in the cau&s;e being fini&s;hed, I will now produce &s;everal precedents from Courts-Mar|tial held in the Briti&s;h army to &s;hew that pro&s;ecutors have been admitted a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Judge-Advocate. This Coun|try once allowed Briti&s;h precedents great weight in all their Courts. Whether the change of Government hath nullified the u&s;ages, as well as &s;ubverted the written po&s;itive in&s;titu|tions of England is left to the Court to determine. You Gentlemen, can certainly regulate your own proceedings, and there cannot, I think be any impropriety in your mak|ing u&s;e of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance which may contribute to di&s;cover facts or enforce truth. Capt. England, Capt. Willoe, and Lieut. Bibby, will inform the Court of the in&s;tances to my purpo&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>Mr. Pre&s;ident and Gentlemen of the Court,</HI></P>
<P>THIS, in common with all Courts of Record, undoubted|ly has power to direct it's own proceedings, &s;ubject to the articles of war. I do not ground my objection on any thing in tho&s;e articles prohibitory of the claim I op|po&s;e, but on the cu&s;toms which prevail in the American ar|my and the &s;uppo&s;ed duty of the Judge-Advocate. Tho&s;e articles con&s;titute a Judge-Advocate, who, although enjoin|ed
<PB N="73" REF="016139_0072_0F9B77A5924C5768">
to pro&s;ecute In behalf of the government; hath always been con&s;idered in our armies bound to a&s;&s;i&s;t the pri&s;oner, not only in points of law, but by an impartial repre&s;entation of facts. The whole evidence in the trial is taken in writ|ing, &s;ubject to the in&s;pection of the Court. You cannot, therefore, Gentlemen, be deceived by &s;ophi&s;try, or mi&s;led by rhetorick. Pleadings for this rea&s;on are unnece&s;&s;ary, except on a point of law, for which the Judge-Advocate is pre&s;umed to be competent; and unbia&s;&s;ed by the tenure of his office.</P>
<P>I do not oppo&s;e the&s;e precedents becau&s;e they are Briti&s;h; had they been from Portugal or Turkey, and been perti|nent and rea&s;onable, they ought to influence your determi|nation. Although the in&s;tance mentioned by Lieut. Bibby, is rather again&s;t the General, con&s;idered in the latitude to which he aims to extend his claim. The articles of war which govern the Briti&s;h army are extracted from the Roman code of civil law; and ours are nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e adopted by the Briti&s;h mutiny act.</P>
<P>The trials by Courts-martial are de&s;igned to be &s;imple, &s;peedy and deci&s;ive. The &s;oldiers duty is clearly pre&s;cri|bed, and the puni&s;hment for neglect of it plainly a&s;certain|ed, by the articles which give juri&s;diction to the Court that are to inquire into, and puni&s;h delinquency. The Judge-Advocate acts in the double capacity of pro&s;ecutor and council to the pri&s;oner, which, tho&s;e who are acquainted with the proceedings of military courts, will allow not to be incon&s;i&s;tent duties. The office of Judge-Advocate has been con&s;idered by &s;ome in an army, the &s;ame as that of Attorney-General in the courts of criminal juri&s;diction at common law, but I can &s;afely appeal to your deci&s;ion Gentlemen, if I am wrong in the duty of that officer in our army as I have laid it down.</P>
<P>The altercations of the bar in the Courts of common law, ari&s;e from a combination of rights in free &s;ociety, which are unknown in an army. A man when he commen|ces a &s;oldier, makes a temporary relinqui&s;hment of the pri|vileges of a citizen. If a pro&s;ecutor, (and in this ca&s;e a very able one) is admitted in addition to the Judge-Advo|cate, &s;urely it would be unrea&s;onable to deny council in defence of the pri&s;oner&mdash;and then con&s;ider, Gentlemen, what would be the con&s;equence: Every man brought before
<PB N="74" REF="016139_0073_0F9B77A5CE893100">
a Court-martial would be intitled to the &s;ame indulgence. All the &s;ubtleties and delays which prevail at common law would be introduced, into Courts-martial, infinitely to the public di&s;&s;ervice, under the circum&s;tances which armies, <HI>Durante bello</HI> e&s;pecially ought to be maintained and gover|ned. I &s;ubmit my objection to the opinion of the Court.</P>
<P>The Court was ordered to be cleared.</P>
<P>The Court after debate, were of opinion, that General Burgoyne &s;hould have the liberty of remarking upon the evidence offered by Col. Henley, and the Judge-Advocate was directed to acquaint the General with this determination.</P>

<P>Col. Henley being called upon to clo&s;e his defence, reply'd as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Pre&s;ident and Gentlemen of the Court,</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE particular rea&s;ons, and in my own apprehen&s;ion very &s;ufficient, for declining to &s;ay a &s;ingle word in an|&s;wer to the illiberal abu&s;e thrown upon me, and the palpable di&s;honour done to my country, by Gen. Burgoyne, in this Court. It is Mr. Pre&s;ident, a new thing under the &s;un, and taken in all its circum&s;tances totally without example.&mdash;The Judge-Advocate will &s;um up the evidence wiih ability and impartiality&mdash;Such is my con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done no|thing thro' this whole affair, but what the honor and &s;afety of my Country ab&s;olutely required, that I &s;hall re&s;t entirely &s;atisfied with your deci&s;ion; being at the &s;ame time fully per&s;uaded, that the impartial public, at who&s;e bar I &s;tand, will join with you in acquitting me from all the injurious and illiberal charges of Gen. Burgoyne, and that they will vindicate me for that humanity, characteri&s;tic of an Ame|rican officer, and with which the officers and &s;oldiers of Gen. Burgoyne's late army have been treated, while I was honour'd with the command of the guards.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="016139_0074_0F9B77A6843F9DB0">Gen. Burgoyne then made a few remarks upon the evi|dence offered by Col. Henley; and fini&s;hed his addre&s;s to the Court by &s;ubmitting &s;ome rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify the part he had taken during the trial, and in exculpation of him&s;elf from the reflections of Col. Henley. (No notes were tak|en of this &s;peech.)</P>
<P><HI>The Court adjourned to Tue&s;day</HI> 24<HI>th in&s;tant, at ten o'clock.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="proceedings">
<HEAD>TUESDAY, <DATE>February 24, 1778</DATE>. The Court met pur&s;uant to adjournment.</HEAD>
<P>The Judge-Advocate addre&s;&s;ed the Court in &s;ub&s;tance as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Pre&s;ident and Gentlemen of the Court,</HI></P>
<P>IT remains with me to clo&s;e this cau&s;e which has employ|ed &s;o much time, and been the &s;ubject of &s;uch public expectation. The mode of inquiry e&s;tabli&s;hed in all tryals by Courts-martial, nece&s;&s;arily renders the proce&s;s tedious. This has been particularly &s;o, and was an apology wanting, the patience exhibited by the Court through the whole cour&s;e of it, would atone for the hours &s;pent in the inve&s;tigation of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>This cau&s;e, Gentlemen, has been rendered important rather from the di&s;tingui&s;hed rank and peculiar circum&s;tan|ces of the very able pro&s;ecutor, than from the real merits of it. For however it may have been in&s;inuated that Col. Henley was appointed commandant of the garri&s;on at Cam|bridge, for the purpo&s;e of executing the bloody de&s;igns of an irritated, vindictive, and &s;anguinary people; I believe the public, as well as the Court, will con&s;ider the pri&s;oner as alone intere&s;ted in it; and that this tryal mu&s;t forever &s;tand the cleared re&s;utation to any one hardy enough to <HI>repeat</HI> an a&s;&s;ertion as injurious as it is fal&s;e.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the charge handed to Gen. Heath, the guardian of the public military reputation in this depart|ment, than Col. Henley was &s;u&s;pended from his command and an immediate inquiry ordered into his conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="016139_0075_0F9B77A76DB23630">Yet notwith&s;tanding this prompt, this early endeavour to di&s;cover facts, and puni&s;h if criminality &s;hould be proved, a wound has been aimed at the reputation of this country.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, Gentlemen, before a re&s;pectable and crowded audience, that a general ma&s;&s;acre of the troops of the con|vention was in contemplation, and Col. Henley fix'd upon as the black in&s;trument of execution. There was not an American pre&s;ent at that time, I dare a&s;&s;ert, who did not feel indignation beat in every pul&s;e, while his heart reprobated the idea.</P>
<P>This charge, heightened with all the pomp of words which attic diction and tragic eloquence could furni&s;h; painted in tho&s;e vivid, animated colours which keen feel|ings and lively apprehen&s;ions would &s;upply; wanted nothing but <HI>truth</HI> to have an&s;wered the de&s;ign propo&s;ed. And that this was wanting, you Gentlemen, from the evidence now on your table, are, I pre&s;ume, convinced. The world here|after may be &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>If I thought General Burgoyne when making this a&s;&s;er|tion &s;incerely believed it to be true, tho' I &s;hould wonder at his deception, I &s;hould have a better opinion of his fairne&s;s: And while we &s;mil'd at his panic, we might pity his timidity.</P>
<P>Whatever particular, per&s;onal rea&s;ons for gaining popu|larity, or &s;ecuring the affections of his army; or great poli|tical motives may have actuated the pro&s;ecutor in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, you Gentlemen who are to judge upon oath as well as upon honour, the two &s;trange&s;t ties that can bind you as men and as &s;oldiers, will be &s;wayed by nothing but the &s;a|cred principles of truth and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It is my duty to exhibit facts as they ari&s;e from the evi|dence, &s;tripped of the meretricious coverings which ingenui|ty and rhetoric have attempted to conceal them in.</P>
<P>However excu&s;able it may be in Gen. Burgoyne to take a partial &s;urvey of the cau&s;e; by well turn'd periods to catch the attention and force the admiration of li&s;tning crowds; and by a brilliancy of expre&s;&s;ion or affected nobi|lity of &s;entiment attempt to dazzle, the more effectually to mi&s;lead the Court; the Judge-Advocate has a very different part to act. He ought to know no party, but undeviating|ly to follow the road marked out by truth alone.</P>
<P>The difficulty of keeping the mind unbiased in this cau&s;e will &s;trike the minds of die Court. This is the tryal
<PB N="77" REF="016139_0076_0F9B77A8000AC9B8">
a gallant and meretorious officer; of a man, who&s;e &s;ervices in camp and in the field mo&s;t of you Gentlemen have been witne&s;&s;es to, and who&s;e conduct as a citizen, previous to his commencing the &s;oldier, was ever irreproachable. I mu&s;t then depend on the candour of the Court, &s;hould I err in &s;umming up the evidence, to re&s;tore me to the path of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s. Much is due to the character of &s;uch an officer; but more to the &s;afety of thou&s;ands, who, di&s;armed and in our power, are intitled by the laws of nations, of war, of humanity and of ju&s;tice, to protection and &s;ecurity, provided no mal-conduct on their parts, works a forfeiture of the&s;e rights.

<P>Col. Henley &s;tands before you, Gentlemen, accu&s;ed by Gen. Burgoyne &amp;c. (The charge was here read)</P>
<P>The evidence in maintenance of this charge, may be re|duced to five different heads, or cla&s;&s;ed as di&s;tinct facts, in each of which the pri&s;oner has been repre&s;ented by the pro|&s;ecutor, either as principal agent, or a particeps criminis.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The wounding of corporal Reeves at the guard-hou&s;e on 19th December. The Colonel&mdash;a principal.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;tabbing Tragget by a &s;erjeant of the militia on the morning of 8th January. The Colonel an acce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;tabbing Will&s;on on the &s;ame morning. The Col. an accomplice.</P>
<P N="4">4. Col Henley wounding corporal Hadley on the parade at Pro&s;pect-hill the 8th January.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Head of evidence. To prove a general, inimical and murderous principle in the officers and &s;oldiers of the guards, towards the Briti&s;h troops. In which the Colonel is involved, becau&s;e he took no care to curb the malevolence and cruelty of his men,; and ought therefore to be con&s;i|dered as an accomplice is all the violences committed.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this arrangement. I will read the whole evi|dence adduced in &s;upport of each &s;eperate fact, and then contra&s;t it by the te&s;timony offered on the part of the defence.</P>
<P>The depo&s;itions of <HI>Buchannan, Thomp&s;on, Steele</HI> (and Mr. <HI>Brown</HI> as to the nature of the wound) read, and oppo|&s;ed by tho&s;e of Major <HI>Swa&s;ey,</HI> Capt. <HI>Wild, Dean, Elijah Horton, Mor&s;e, Brazier, Wad&s;worth Horton, and Barry.</HI> (Vide their te&s;timonies.)</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="016139_0077_0F9B77AB320E7400">From this collective view of the evidence it appears, that Col. Henley on the 19th December in con&s;equence of or|ders from General Heath, vi&s;ited the main-guard with Major Swa&s;ey with the de&s;ign of relea&s;ing a number of Briti&s;h &s;ol|diers who had got into cu&s;tody, for different mi&s;demeanors. That he was calm and good humour'd, and proceeded to execute his in&s;tructions in the mo&s;t &s;uitable way, that of enquiring into the re&s;pective offences of the culprits, previ|ous to their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and cautioning them again&s;t conduct which might &s;ubject them to another confinement. Reeves, in turn, being a&s;ked the cau&s;e of his commitment, with &s;ome he&s;itancy inform'd the Colonel. And from his own account it appeared he had &s;o gro&s;sly affronted an Ame|rican officer that even the nerves of the candid, the placid Major Swa&s;ey grew irritated, and he was provoked enough to give Reeves a very re&s;entful an&s;wer. Col. Henley's feelings being more keen, he called Reeves a ra&s;cal; Reeves retorted the epithet; and the Colonel after repeatedly ordering &s;ilence, in order effectually to &s;top a very har&s;h altercation, which had en&s;ued, di&s;mounted from his hor&s;e, &s;eized a gun and fix'd bayonet and pricked Reeves in the brea&s;t. It ap|pears from the concurrent te&s;timony of all the witne&s;&s;es on the &s;ide of Col. Henley, that his de&s;ign was rather to &s;ilence Reeves than to wound him; rather to convince him he would be obey'd than to injure him. The extreme &s;light|ne&s;s of the wound, which, from the &s;urgeon's account was little more than a &s;cratch, confirms this to have been the Colonel's intention. It would certainly have been better to have remanded him to the guard-hou&s;e. And if, Gentle|men, you think the witne&s;&s;es in &s;upport of the charge have told you all that really pa&s;&s;ed, you ought, at lea&s;t, to think, that Col. Henley is a ra&s;h, pa&s;&s;ionate, precipitate officer, a man who con&s;iders &s;tabbing his fellow-creatures as a very venial offence. But if full credence is given to the evidence of <HI>Dean, E. Horton, Mor&s;e, Brazier, Barry</HI> and particularly <HI>Wad&s;worth Horton,</HI> the Court will con&s;ider whether an offi|cer, acting in &s;uch a character as the Colonel then appeared in, &s;o &s;aucely and abu&s;ively reply'd to by a pri&s;oner in Reeve's circum&s;tances, is not pardonable, I do not &s;ay ju&s;tifiable, in adopting &s;uch a mode of &s;ilencing impudence and repre&s;&s;ing contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="016139_0078_0F9B77AC79CAF7B8">It has been &s;aid that Reeve's behaviour was only firm, not in&s;olent Briti&s;h firmne&s;s often &s;o nearly approaches in|&s;olence, that Europeans as well as Americans have been very apt to confound them. The Court will recollect the pains taken, in one or two in&s;tances during this tryal, to get from the Briti&s;h witne&s;&s;es their idea of in&s;olence. They all affected to think it impo&s;&s;ible a Briton could look in&s;o|lent. It was, they &s;aid, only looking up. But this <HI>os &s;ublime,</HI> this erect countenance which they boa&s;t of, leads them to looking down upon the re&s;t of the world, though not always with impunity. Britain is feared becau&s;e &s;he is powerful. What pity it is a nation cannot be ju&s;t as well as gallant. Le&s;s pride had prevented the di&s;memberment of her empire, had &s;aved the blood of thou&s;ands. And real magnanimity had e'er this arre&s;ted the hand of de&s;truction from the heads of men, who&s;e greate&s;t fault (once the glo|rious fault of Britons!) is the love of freedom.</P>
<P>Let us now inquire, whether in this action the pri&s;oner is guilty of the la&s;t part of the charge, viz. "Intentional mur|der."</P>
<P>Murder is thus defined by one of the fir&s;t &s;ages of common law.
<Q>When a per&s;on of found memory and de&s;cretion, unlawfully killeth any rea&s;onable creature in being, and under the King's (or State's) peace, with malice afore|thought, either expre&s;&s;ed by the party or implied by law, &s;o as the party wounded and hurt, die of the wound or hurt within a year and a day after the &s;ame</Q>
3 In&s;t. 47,</P>
<P>The grand criterion of this crime is malice prepen&s;e, the dictate of a wicked, depraved and malignant &s;pirit; and is either expre&s;s or implied. Fo&s;ter 256.</P>
<P>I will not trouble the Court with multiplied authorities. The above definition of Lord Coke's is &s;o well analy&s;ed and illu&s;trated by the able and accurate Judge Black&s;tone, that a few pages from his commentaries will furni&s;h the Court with all the law nece&s;&s;ary on this point. Vid. 4th Black&s;t. 195, 6, 7, 8 9, 200, 201.</P>
<P>From the doctrine here laid down you will con&s;ider, appying the evidence to the principles ju&s;t read, whether the pri&s;oner can be &s;aid to have acted from expre&s;s or implied malice. Did Col. Henley aim at taking Reeves's life? If he did, and the provocation did not ari&s;e to the degree, which the law makes nece&s;&s;ary to excu&s;e, although the &s;troke was not
<PB N="80" REF="016139_0079_0F9B77AC986C9428">
&s;ufficient to effect the murderous de&s;ign, you mu&s;t be of opinion that the la&s;t article of the charge is proved. If he did not attempt Reeves's life, you ought to acquit him of the intentional guilt he is in this in&s;tance charged with.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, that admitting Reeves's behaviour to have amounted to &s;uch a degree of provocation that if the Col. had killed him in the pa&s;&s;ionate in&s;tant and while &s;itting on his hor&s;e, it might not have been murder, yet the di&s;mount|ing gave him time for recollection; and had he then killed in&s;tead of wounded him, it would have been murder.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t deny this di&s;tinction to be ju&s;t. And to &s;hew that the General was erroneous in this po&s;ition, I &s;hall read a ca&s;e cited by Judge Fo&s;ter from Lord Coke and Hale. Vid. Fo&s;t. 294. From this and many &s;imilar adjudications which might be produced, it is clear, if Col. Henley would not have been guilty of murder had he &s;tabbed Reeves to the heart, while upon his hor&s;e, that his committing the ho|micide after the di&s;mounting and &s;eizing the bayonet, wou'd not have been evidence of that crime, becau&s;e there was not time for the blood to cool.</P>
<P>Intentional criminality is puni&s;hable at the bar of God alone. Yet, Gentlemen, &s;hould you be convinced, that Col. Henley de&s;igned to kill Reeves at the time he made the pa&s;s at him although he fail'd; you mu&s;t con&s;ider him as a very improper per&s;on to handle mu&s;kets and bayonets, for the man was &s;o intirely in his power, that he could ea&s;i|ly have adopted any other mode of puni&s;hment. And tho' he might de&s;erve a caning or a flagilation for his impudence and in&s;ult, he &s;urely did not merit death.</P>
<P>The next tran&s;action is the &s;tabbing Tragget by a &s;erjeant of the militia on the 8th January.</P>
<P>This is proved by <HI>Page, Lee</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> and the &s;ur|geons <HI>Walker</HI> and <HI>Clartey</HI> &s;wear to the nature and depth of the wound. Major <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> and Lieut. <HI>Smith</HI> to the pecea|ble behaviour of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers while the detachment was marching by. Their depo&s;itions are &s;trongly contra&s;ted by tho&s;e of <HI>Kettle, Duckinfield, Ander&s;on,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Dodge.</HI> (Vid. the evidence of each.)</P>
<P>It has not been alledged that Col. Henley was pre&s;ent at or knowing to this tran&s;action. I &s;hall not therefore here minutely enter into the circum&s;tances attending it, but only con&s;ider whether Col. Henley can be adjudged an acce&s;&s;ary to the &s;tabbing of Tragget.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="016139_0080_0F9B77AD4DEC4520">Acce&s;&s;ary <HI>(particeps criminis)</HI> is where a man is guilty of a felonious offence, not principally, but by participation, as by command, advice or concealment.</P>
<P>A man may be an acce&s;&s;ary either before or after the fact.</P>
<P>An acce&s;&s;ary before the fact is he that being ab&s;ent at the time of the felony committed doth yet procure, coun&s;el, command or abet another to commit a felony, 1 H. P. C. 615.</P>
<P>Acce&s;&s;ary after the fact is he that receives, a&s;&s;i&s;ts, or com|forts any man that hath committed felony or murder, 1 H. P. C. 618.</P>
<P>Is there the lea&s;t evidence to &s;hew, that in the ca&s;e of Tragget, the Colonel comes within the circum&s;tances nece&s;|&s;ary by the above de&s;cription, to involve him in the predica|ment contended for? There certainly is not.</P>
<P>It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that as there was no felony committed, there could be no acce&s;&s;ary. And that if the Colonel had any thing to do in this affair, he mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a principal; for in all crimes under the degree of felony there are no acce&s;&s;aries. 4 Black&s;t. 36.</P>
<P>So far from Col. Henley's coun&s;elling, abetting, a&s;&s;i&s;ting or comforting the per&s;ons concerned in this action, it does not appear that he ever heard of it, till the witne&s;&s;es rela|ted the fact upon oath before the Court.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays General Burgoyne, Col. Henley's conduct had a great effect on his guards: He was known to be no friend of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers; he had him&s;elf wounded one, and been violent in his menaces again&s;t them all: he thus influenced his &s;oldiers to &s;tab and murder whom they plea&s;ed, if they belonged to the Briti&s;h army; and ought therefore to be con&s;idered as an accomplice in every outrage which took place. If this rea&s;oning is conclu&s;ive, by the &s;ame logic the General him&s;elf is an acce&s;&s;ary to all the murders perpetrated by the ferocious Bipeds, the Savages who accompanied and di&s;graced his army la&s;t &s;ummer. Ought it to be &s;aid that becau&s;e the&s;e <HI>black</HI> attendants knew that Gen. Burgoyne did not love Americans, that therefore he would be plea&s;ed at the butchery of the nervele&s;s old man, defencele&s;s female, and infant prattler? Becau&s;e he hated rebels, he therefore influenced the Indians to ma&s;&s;acre that young unfortunate, the inoffending and wretched Mi&s;s McCrea!</P>

<P>The incidents whieh led to this affair, appears from the evidence to be the&s;e: On the morning of 8th January, Col. Henley and Major Swa&s;ey on their way down to Pro&s;pect-hill met Buchannan, who the Court have before heard of as an offender as well as a witne&s;s, &s;tealing up to town un|der the cover of another man's pa&s;s. Deceptions of this kind had been &s;o often played off upon the centries, that the Colonel thought proper to &s;end Buchannan to the guard-hou&s;e for this flagrant breach of general orders. And at the &s;ame time gave orders to the corporal and file of men who had the charge of him to fire on any men daring enough to attempt re&s;cuing him. Major Swa&s;ey (the town Major) &s;ays that re&s;cues had become frequent. This order then was right, and nece&s;&s;ary: Particularly as the guards, com|po&s;ed entirely of militia, had too often &s;uffered them&s;elves to be duped, ridiculed and in&s;ulted, and wanted &s;pirited or|ders and &s;upport to encourage them to di&s;charge their duty and trample on contempt. The guard proceeded with their pri&s;oner, but before they reached the guard-hou&s;e, were interrupted in their march by a large clu&s;ter of Briti&s;h &s;ol|diers who by pre&s;&s;ing upon them, and huzzaing and clamou|ring, gave Buchannan a very favourable opportunity to effect an e&s;cape, and he did not want much urging to make the mo&s;t of it. Will&s;on who was mo&s;t bu&s;y in this matter after Buchannan had got hu&s;led among his comrades, &s;eized the corporal of the guard who was endeavouring to recover his pri&s;oner from the crowd and &s;topped his pur&s;uit. This rou&s;ed Peirce, who could not tamely look on and &s;ee his corporal checked in an act of duty, and he made a pa&s;s at Will&s;on and wounded him; and very hone&s;tly tells you that he did it with a good will.</P>
<P>Though the witne&s;&s;es to this affair militate more than in any other part of the evidence, yet it is pa&s;t a doubt that a re&s;cue or &s;omething extremely like one took place. Kidley and Keith both &s;ay, that they did not &s;ee Buchannan e&s;cape, but they heard afterwards he had. Peirce &s;wears po&s;itively that he was forceably taken from the guard, and Lewis corroberates his evidence. Major Swa&s;ey who&s;e candour in
<PB N="83" REF="016139_0082_0F9B77AF70F8D998">
every narrative he has given the Court &s;tamps him as re&s;pect|able a witne&s;s as has been &s;worn, declares that he &s;aw a Briti&s;h &s;oldier take hold of one of the guard, at the &s;ame time Buchannan was pu&s;hing his way through the crowd of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers who were calling out and encouraging him to run off.</P>
<P>Should the Court think a re&s;cue was made and Will&s;on principally concerned in it, they mu&s;t think Peirce ju&s;tified in what he did. For I a&s;&s;ert that had he killed him upon the &s;pot, and wounded every man who was abetting the re&s;|cue, he would have been excu&s;able.</P>
<P>I will produce only one authority to ju&s;tify this opinion, Homicide (&s;aith Lord Hale) in <HI>civil</HI> cau&s;es may be ju&s;tified in &s;ome ca&s;es: As where a Sheriff attempting to make a lawful arre&s;t in a civil action or to retake one who has been arre&s;ted and made his e&s;cape, is re&s;i&s;ted by the party and unavoidably kills him in the affray. H. P. C. 71.</P>
<P>If this doctrine is true upon a civil proce&s;s, <HI>a fortiori,</HI> it is on a criminal one. In this ca&s;e Buchannan was an offender in cu&s;tody: Whoever ventured to re&s;cue him did it at their utmo&s;t peril. Briti&s;h &s;oldiers are too well acquainted with di&s;cipline and military &s;everity not to know they were acting egregiou&s;ly ill. But &s;uch attempts had before &s;ucceeded, and why not then? The offenders had before e&s;caped with impunity, and why not again? Will&s;on painfully learnt that &s;uch rea&s;oning was &s;ometimes wrong. I wi&s;h all his bro|ther-&s;oldiers may profit from his experience.</P>
<P>The Court will con&s;ider the principles before laid down under the head of acce&s;&s;ary, and as far as they are applica|ble, allow their operation. And then determine whether any part of the charge is &s;upported again&s;t Col. Henley in the ca&s;e of Will&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>WEDNESDAY, <DATE>February 25, 1778</DATE>. The Court met pur&s;uant to adjournment.</HEAD>
<P>Judge Advocate.]</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Pre&s;ident and Gentlemen of the Court,</HI></P>
<P>WE come now to the la&s;t and principal tran&s;action of of the 8th January&mdash;the wounding Hadley on the parade.</P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate the circum&s;tances anterior to this unfortunate action. You have the fulle&s;t proof, the confe&s;&s;ion of the pro&s;ecutor, that a centinel on the evening of the 7th was knock'd down on his po&s;t, that he was beat, di&s;armed and his gun carried off. Col. Gerri&s;h, like a true &s;pirited officer, upon hearing of this daring outrage, deter|mined immediately and in per&s;on to di&s;cover the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers who were concerned in it. He accordingly with a party of his regiment &s;urrounded one of the Briti&s;h barracks, and after &s;ome oppo&s;ition &s;earched &s;everal rooms which ap|peared &s;u&s;picious. The conduct of a number of very ob|&s;treperous fellows, which he found in one of the rooms, &s;trengthened his &s;u&s;picion, and he thought proper, after be|ing a&s;&s;aulted, menaced and in&s;ulted, to &s;end &s;everal of them to the main-guard. The tran&s;actions of this evening were reported to Col. Henley next morning with aggravation. The Colonel finding he had got &s;o large a number of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers as 29, pri&s;oners in the main-guard which was &s;ituated &s;o near the barracks of the Briti&s;h army that &s;ome difficulty might ari&s;e, adjudged it mo&s;t prudent to remove all the pri|&s;oners up to the town, where a proper inquiry could be made; the culpable puni&s;hed, and the innocent di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. A detachment of 100 men were ordered to the main-guard for this purpo&s;e. And the Colonel with the town major &s;et out for the Hill to &s;ee that the detachment did their du|ty. On his way down, he met Buchannan, playing off upon a &s;entinal the eva&s;ive trick which had now become common, with the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, that of e&s;caping from their bar|racks under counterfeit or borrowed pa&s;&s;es. The Colonel gave the orders (re&s;pecting Buchannan) we have before read; and proceeded on for the main-guard; not with the mo&s;t agreeable feelings, if we &s;uppo&s;e the irritation which a
<PB N="85" REF="016139_0084_0F9B77B05FA015A8">
variety of offen&s;ive reports and provoking con&s;iderations, mu&s;t have rai&s;ed in his mind, during the cour&s;e of the morn|ing. Soon after he got to the main-guard, the detachment marched into the citadel and formed near the guard-hou&s;e. By this time a very large body of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers had a&s;&s;em|bled near the guard-hou&s;e, Captain Brooks &s;ays, to the number of three hundred. The Colonel apprehen&s;ive that &s;ome di&s;orders might ari&s;e, when the Briti&s;h pri&s;oners &s;hould be &s;ent off with the detachment, ordered the Briti&s;h &s;oldi|ers to di&s;per&s;e&mdash;finding he was not likely to be obeyed&mdash;he called for a dozen men from the detachment, which pro|duced a movement among them, and they were going off; when ju&s;t at this time Buchannan was re&s;cued within &s;ight of Col. Henley. This act of in&s;olent triumph, determined Col. Henley to take the immediate per&s;onal command of the detachment, which he in&s;tantly marched out of the cita|del upon the parade in the rear of the barracks. He had hardly time to halt his men before he was &s;urrounded by the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, who amounted to near two hundred men, which was double his number. I rate the number on a medium between what they were &s;aid to be, by the wit|ne&s;&s;es for the pro&s;ecution, and tho&s;e in behalf of Col. Hen|ley. Con&s;ider now Gentlemen, what mu&s;t have been Col. Henley's &s;en&s;ations; at the head of a party of militia, who, from being daily affronted by the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, were be|come their je&s;t; that it had at length become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to convince the&s;e Britons, that there was energy enough in their guards to force obedience and curb licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s; that a tumult had ari&s;en the night before, and that an act had ju&s;t taken place which was a defiance to him|&s;elf: that he had not room to manoeuvre his men without great difficulty, owing to the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers pre&s;&s;ing in upon the party; and that the&s;e were mo&s;t of them the very men who had ju&s;t before been laughing at the party, while paraded in the citadel, and who, in contempt of his orders, were again collected to keep up the laugh at the expence of the detachment. I put it upon this footing, becau&s;e I think it was apparent they were a&s;&s;embled rather to in&s;ult than to a&s;&s;ail the party; though they were &s;o near, that it was only &s;tretching out their arms, and it would have been ea&s;y to have di&s;armed the detachment by a &s;udden movement; e&s;pecially after the Colonel had detached a quarter of his
<PB N="86" REF="016139_0085_0F9B77B101C75668">
whole party to bring out the pri&s;oners from the guard-hou&s;e. &mdash;Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, Gentlemen, and &s;till more &s;o if he was apprehen&s;ive of an attempt to di&s;arm his men, how extremely difficult mu&s;t it have been for the Colonel to have checked his re&s;entment, or &s;topped the hand which had been &s;o repeatedly and in&s;olently defy'd. The Colo|nel had told them he had lo&s;t a pri&s;oner, threatned to fire upon them, and given reiterated orders for them to di&s;per&s;e before he made the lunge at Hadley. It has been proved that the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers in general were &s;lowly moving off at the time, but not that Hadley was one of them. If you are convinced, Gentlemen, that he was going off, you will then con&s;ider how far the Colonel's impetuo&s;ity is reprehen|&s;ible, and puni&s;h him accordingly.</P>
<P>It appears clearly that the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers had no weapons of any kind in their hands, that they made no attempt on the guard nor &s;truck any of them, from which it may be a que&s;tion, whether had Hadley died of the wound he received from Col. Henley, the Colonel would not have been guilty of murder, becau&s;e upon the principles of municipal law, words alone, however impudent or provoking, will not re|duce murder to man-&s;laughter, though a very &s;light blow fir&s;t given by the per&s;on kill'd might have made the killing man-&s;laughter, or even a le&s;s &s;pecies of homicide.</P>
<P>If the nice di&s;tinctions of common law are to be made the rules of conduct in military di&s;cipline, and the regulation of a garri&s;on, Col. Henley mu&s;t &s;uffer. But I imagine Gentlemen, you will hardly admit this to be true. Becau&s;e &s;oldiers and citizens are intitled to very different privileges.</P>
<P>In an army, the di&s;obedience of an order is &s;ometimes puni&s;hed with in&s;tant death, and &s;uch an action ju&s;tified and applauded, which was it to take place among citizens might &s;ubject a man to a halter.</P>
<P>Col. Henley had &s;tood for &s;ome time, fir&s;t in the citadel, and afterwards on the parade at the head of a detachment armed, and heard the provoking epithets of yankey and rebel very liberally thrown out again&s;t his guards, by the Scotch and Briti&s;h loyali&s;ts who &s;urrounded him. The word <HI>yankey,</HI> when u&s;ed by the&s;e proficients in abu&s;e, is intended to con|vey the idea of clowni&s;hne&s;s and cowardice. And to call a man yankey rebel, is con&s;idered by them as the &s;tronge&s;t term of invective. Where is the officer in &s;uch circum&s;tances who could &s;uppre&s;s his indignation upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion?</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="016139_0086_0F9B77B1C1013F78">If Gentlemen you &s;hould be &s;atisfied, that Hadley at the time he was wounded, was moving off, you will con&s;ider whether Col. Henley is not very blame-worthy for making a violent lunge into a man's body, who was obeying his or|ders and getting out of his way&mdash;&s;hould you be convinced that Hadley was not removing, though &s;uch preremptory and repeated orders were given him with his comrades to re|tire to their barracks, your opinion will be different.</P>
<P>The witne&s;&s;es under the la&s;t head of evidence are Lieut. Bibby, Lieut. Col. Lind, &s;erjeants Fleming and Will&s;on.</P>
<P>Mr. Bibby &s;wears that on the morning of the 8th January, as he pa&s;&s;ed over the parade where the detachment was drawn up, he heard an officer who he took to be the Captain of the guard, "Damn his men for inattention and ordering them to run any man through who came near them." This &s;peech appears to have been made &s;oon after the wounding Hadley, while the pa&s;&s;ions were in a tumult, and the pul&s;e beating high from what had pa&s;&s;ed. The order was ra&s;h and unju&s;tifiable, and the Court will con&s;ider whether the ex|ample ju&s;t &s;et by Col. Henley, in &s;tabbing Hadley, did not occa&s;ion it, and how far he is accountable for encouraging &s;en|timents of &s;uch a nature.</P>
<P>The in&s;tance mentioned by Col. Lind, of the &s;entry's firing on three camp women, cannot by any means affect Col. Henley, becau&s;e it does not appear that he ever gave &s;uch orders, nor was any report made of it to him. For &s;urely it would be unrea&s;onable to make the commandant of &s;uch a garri&s;on as this is, where the guards are made up of a young and inexperienced militia, un&s;kill'd in military &s;cience or duty, accountable for all the mi&s;takes and violences of &s;uch &s;oldiers. Had a complaint been made to him of this action, and he had refu&s;ed taking notice of it, it would un|doubtedly have been &s;uch an avowal of it, as to have made him re&s;pon&s;ible for all the con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>The expre&s;&s;ions and violent menaces, which Fleming and Will&s;on &s;wear they heard Col. Henley throw out at the Adjutant-General's office on 16th December, carry with them, <HI>prima facie</HI> very &s;trong marks of malice, and a heart boiling with the mo&s;t vindictive and turbulent pa&s;&s;ions. But the Court will recollect that the Colonel had that morning a re|port of Ma&s;on and Crane being knock'd down and di&s;armed, while one of them was on his po&s;t. They were both much
<PB N="88" REF="016139_0087_0F9B77B61FC96F98">
beat. It does not appear what led to the conver&s;ation, but Col. Henley was relating the affair to &s;ome officer in the office when the &s;erjeant came up and met with the &s;alute, which has been laid before the Court. The greeting was rough to be &s;ure, but might not the meaning only be, that the Devil had got into their barracks and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the occu|piers of them, and that he &s;hould turn exorci&s;t &s;ome night or other, turn the barracks in&s;ide out, and expel him from their territory. But I mean not Gentlemen to palliate this mat|ter, the words are before you. You are the judges, and will determine how far the &s;entiments expre&s;&s;ed were mali|cious, and afterwards as &s;uch, acted from by the Colonel.</P>
<P>I will not take up any of the Court's time by remarks on the evidence of the different re&s;cues that took place from the beginning of December to 8th January, except of that &s;worn to by Lieutenant Stearns. This officer, after being in&s;ulted in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner by words and ge&s;ture; after having the fellow who gave it re&s;cued in his &s;ight; and after com|plaining, through tenderne&s;s, to the man's own officers; proving the complicated charge again&s;t him; to be then tri|fled with by a promi&s;e of a proper puni&s;hment being inflicted on the aggre&s;&s;or, and after all to have the fellow &s;et at liber|ty unpuni&s;hed; proves the nece&s;&s;ity of exerci&s;ing the right &s;et up by Gen. Heath of puni&s;hing the offenders of the con|vention troops, who could thus commit enormities with im|punity, and &s;hews in how contemptable a light the officers of the guards were held by the Briti&s;h army, and the expe|diency of convincing them that there was &s;pirit enough to re&s;ent, injuries and energy enough to cha&s;ti&s;e offenders.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now &s;ubmit the cau&s;e, Gentlemen, to your deci&s;ion. Many ob&s;ervations have been omitted, which might have been pertinent&mdash;but which have doubtle&s;s occurred to the minds of the Court, particularly with re&s;pect to the charac|ters and contradictions of the witne&s;&s;es. And I doubt not your judgment will vindicate the ju&s;tice of our country, and be approved by the hone&s;t and impartial wherever it &s;hall be known.</P>
<P>The Court was then ordered to be cleared.</P>
<P>THE Court after mature con&s;ideration are of opinion that the charge again&s;t Col. Henley is not &s;upported, and that he be di&s;charged from his arre&s;t.</P>
