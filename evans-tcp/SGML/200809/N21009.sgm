<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE importance of the following trial to the Public at large is too well known to need any comment on that head from the Editor; nor would he deem it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing in addition to &s;o va|luable a publication, by way of preface, were it not that the Public expectation has been &s;o greatly alive, and its impatience in no &s;mall degree excited by a &s;eeming delay in bringing it out. The Editor, in ju&s;tice to him&s;elf, cannot &s;uffer it to appear, without adding a few words in his own ju&s;tification, and reque&s;ting that the Public will be|lieve his a&s;&s;urance, that every expedition has been u&s;ed on his part to bring it forward earlier; but as it is the cu&s;tom of the &s;hort-hand writer to leave blanks for the &s;everal quotations, it became a matter o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> greater difficulty to get the&s;e filled up, with exactne&s;s and preci|&s;ion, than can well be conceived by tho&s;e who are not very conver|&s;ant in the&s;e matters; e&s;pecially as Mr. Gerrald was removed from Edinburgh &s;o &s;oon, that the editor could not avail him&s;elf of his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in this re&s;pect, except in a very &s;light degree, before his depart|ure; and having had occa&s;ion to make the application to him, from time to time, on that head &s;ince his arrival in London, the unavoid|able delays attending communications at &s;uch a di&s;tance, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to publi&s;h the Trial &s;ooner.</P>
<P>When it is con&s;idered that in a matter of &s;o much moment to the rights, liberties, and privileges of every Briton, as this celebrated tri|al involves, a trial which has been advocated in a &s;tile &s;o truly brilli|ant and di&s;tingui&s;hed, both by the learned and ingenious coun&s;el on the relevancy of the libel, and by Mr. Gerrald, the Pannel, who&s;e literary fame and &s;plendid talents are as much admired, as the &s;eve|rity of his &s;entence is lamented; from the&s;e circum&s;tances it is pre|&s;umed that no blame can be attached to the Publi&s;her, who&s;e aim has been to have the Trial impartially &s;tated and accurately laid before the Public.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRIAL OF JOSEPH GERRALD.</HEAD>
<P>THE Members of the Court of Ju&s;ticiary a&s;&s;embled preci&s;ely at ten o'clock, in the forenoon. Mr. Gerrald appeared, and placed him&s;elf at the bar.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's Advocate, for his Maje&s;ty's intere&s;t, having been, in the u&s;ual form, called again&s;t the pannel,</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald</HI> &s;aid, My lord, I under&s;tand I am authorized to de|mand that a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t of my exculpatory witne&s;&s;es be read out in Court be|fore the Trial proceeds.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> The criminal libel mu&s;t be read fir&s;t&mdash;that is the fir&s;t thing to be done.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Advocate.</HI> Before your lord&s;hips proceed to reading the li|bel, I feel i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my duty to tell the pannel, that if he means to per|&s;evere in an application which he &s;ignified to me ye&s;terday, by let|ter, the proper period for him to do it is at this moment, before the indictment is read.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> My lords, as I am totally ignorant of the law of this country, being a native of England, I applied to &s;everal gentle|men of the profe&s;&s;ion, to advocate my cau&s;e; they unanimou&s;ly re|lea&s;ed&mdash;in con&s;equence of which, I wrote a line to the Lord Advo|cate, as he has &s;tated, mentioning that I &s;hould certainly make an ap|plication to the court to appoint me coun&s;el. Your lord&s;hips very much lamented, that in former ca&s;es, coun&s;el had not been applied for; and, though the Court are bound to act as coun&s;el for the pri|&s;oner, yet the pannel, no doubt, wi&s;hes to avail him&s;elf of every ad|vantage that he can. I &s;tand peculiarly circum&s;tanced, becau&s;e, not being a native of this country, and being ignorant of its laws, with|out an advocate, I &s;hould he deprived of the benefit of their benig|nant interpretation, as the public pro&s;ecutor will no doubt &s;tate the charge as &s;trongly as he can on the part of the Crown; I therefore offer it as a &s;ugge&s;tion to your lord&s;hips con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> What do you &s;ay to this, my Lord Advo|cate?</P>
<P><HI>Lord Advocate.</HI> My lord, I don't &s;ee that there is any thing put
<PB N="4" REF="027591_0004_0FD7BEBC3A7F0D48">
to me by the pannel; it &s;eems to be an application to the Court: however, I will &s;tate, in a very few words, what occurs to me; and I wi&s;h that the pannel &s;hould hear what I &s;ay, and that the gentle|men of the jury, and of the country at large, &s;hould know what I have to &s;tate.</P>
<P>My lord, while this Briti&s;h convention, or what I never &s;hall cea&s;e to term it, a con&s;piracy again&s;t the con&s;titution of this country, a&s;|&s;embled for many days within this city, and when they had proceed|ed, by my information, to a length which called upon the officers of public ju&s;tice to interfere, I had occa&s;ion to direct tho&s;e &s;teps which appeared nece&s;&s;ary for an enquiry into the &s;ubject; and, upon the morning of the 5th of December, the ringleaders of this convention (and this pannel one of them) were apprehended. My lord, the ne|ce&s;&s;ary inve&s;tigations took &s;ome time ere they were completed; but it was my habit to bring tho&s;e who appeared to me the mo&s;t guilty, to a fair trial before their country, as early as po&s;&s;ible. The fir&s;t per&s;on that I brought forward in the li&s;t was the man who appeared to be mo&s;t guilty, I mean Skirving, who &s;tood trial, in this Court, upon the 6th of January; and the indictment that I felt it nece&s;&s;ary to bring next in order, was the charge again&s;t the pannel now at the bar, which was &s;erved upon him in the month of December, and the day fixed for the 8th of January. The day after the libel was executed upon him, at his re&s;idence in Edinburgh, I received from him a letter in which he appealed to my humanity as well as ju&s;tice, that I &s;hould con&s;ent to a delay of his trial for a fortnight, that he might return to England, and &s;ettle the affairs of a family depend|ent upon him. I in&s;tantly acceded to his reque&s;t, and gave him more than he a&s;ked; I gave him till the 27th of January; and it appears, that upon the evening of Friday the 24th of January, from his own account of the matter, he left London, which would have brought him into this city, a few hours, by the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible expedition, a very few hours before his trial was to commence. By the accidental circum&s;tance of a heavy fall of &s;now, he was prevented from reaching it that morning. Your lord&s;hips and the jury know what pa&s;&s;ed up|on that occa&s;ion. I then felt it my duty to bring before the Court for trial, the young man who &s;its at his right hand, [Mr. Charles Sinclair] and he did not &s;tate any refu&s;al of my brethren to plead; as I tru&s;t they will do, every cau&s;e which the highe&s;t or the mean|e&s;t criminal is entitled to &s;tate, at that bar. I cannot therefore per|fectly credit that what Mr. Sinclair received &s;hould be denied to Mr. Gerrald. But, if it is &s;o, con&s;idering that he &s;at this day fortnight, at the &s;ide of that per&s;on, and I indulged him again at his own re|que&s;t, telling him, that he need not attend La&s;t Monday, but that this preci&s;e day was the day on which I determined to go to trial with him. A fortnight afforded him &s;urely opportunity enough to have applied to your lord&s;hip's ju&s;tice; and every coun&s;el at the bar would, I am &s;ure, have appeared and &s;tated for him every thing that it was competent for him to &s;tate. But at four o'clock ye&s;terday, I receiv|ed
<PB N="5" REF="027591_0005_0FD54BCF623297C8">
from him a letter, the purport of which he has now &s;tated; and I &s;hould feel my&s;elf acting only in the proper and due execution of my duty, if I were to argue to your lord&s;hips to refu&s;e that ap|plication. But there are circum&s;tances which I know, and which I tru&s;t will enter into your lord&s;hips con&s;ideration in giving your opinion upon this application. I hope and tru&s;t that the admini|&s;tration of the criminal ju&s;tice of this country, however calumni|ated, however a&s;per&s;ed, is able to &s;tand the te&s;t in competition with the admini&s;tration of the criminal ju&s;tice of England, or of any country upon the face of this earth. And, late as he comes with his demand, although, perhaps in a few hours, I mu&s;t leave this country to attend my public duty in London, that can be no ob|jection; the conduct of the criminal ju&s;tice of this country remains in abler hands than mine. I tru&s;t your lord&s;hips (without afford|ing a precedent to other pannels to come with an expectation of being li&s;tened to upon &s;o late an application) will accede to his re|que&s;t, for the&s;e rea&s;ons; and to &s;atisfy Mr. Gerrald, that if he has come to this country, a &s;tranger to its laws, and if he has pre&s;um|ed to offend highly, as I charge that he has, that he has not re|ceived that &s;trict admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in this country, which he would in his own, but that he has received that indulgence which calumny it&s;elf cannot reach.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> The pannel is certainly very late in his ap|plication, at the &s;ame time in the circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e, I am not for cutting him &s;hort, however late he may be. I think he is right in making application for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of coun&s;el as a &s;tranger to this country; and I don't &s;ee that he can be &s;uppo&s;ed to know the laws of this country. I think he is right, and I am, for my own part, for giving him coun&s;el. What do your lord&s;hips &s;ay to it?</P>
<P><HI>Lord Henderland.</HI> I own it is my opinion that this pannel, and every pannel, whatever be the charge again&s;t him, &s;hould come to your lord&s;hips bar prepared and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by coun&s;el. It is very true, that the judges are coun&s;el for the pannel, to a certain degree; but their duty is limited; in the fir&s;t place upon the relevancy of the indictment, to &s;ee that no charge &s;hall be admitted again&s;t the pannel which does not nece&s;&s;arily and logically infer the crime; the next part of their duty is to take care that no evidence &s;hall be admitted but what is legal and unexceptionable; the third part of their duty generally falls upon the pre&s;iding judge to addre&s;s the jury upon the evidence, as by act of parliament, and to &s;tate it to them fairly. If any error is committed, I dare &s;ay the court would interfere: that has never been the ca&s;e, and I hope never will, while your lord&s;hip &s;its as judge; but there are ca&s;es in which a coun&s;el may be of great u&s;e to a man: arguments may be made u&s;e of which might otherwi&s;e have e&s;caped. I think he ought to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by coun&s;el; and there|fore I am extremely willing that he &s;hould, though I think this gen|tleman has come exceedingly late indeed. I am not ready perhaps to enquire, becau&s;e I cannot know what were his motives for being
<PB N="6" REF="027591_0006_0FD54BD154B6A490">
&s;o late in his application; but I cannot &s;uppo&s;e he could be ignorant of the right he had to apply for coun&s;el. And I mu&s;t regret too that my Lord Advocate is going to attend his duty in parliament who has &s;o well and ably conducted the other trials; and in who&s;e humanity, as well as abilities, I think this country may place great confi|dence. I mu&s;t regret that he is obliged to be ab&s;ent: yet notwith|&s;tanding that, I agree with your lord&s;hip in de&s;iring that this man &s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by coun&s;el, and that he &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t who are the gentlemen that he wi&s;hes to have. I think that is the proper way; the Li&s;t of Faculty is open to him, and I will venture to &s;ay, there is not a man in it but what is fit in proportion: &s;ome of them may be in experience more or le&s;s able, but there are none of them but what may be very well intru&s;ted with his defence. However, in or|der to give him every indulgence, he &s;hall have his choice; at the &s;ame time recommending to him not wantonly to interfere with the &s;uperior avocations of a gentleman at the bar, whom the Court are not induced to trouble with impo&s;itions upon this head, from a pan|nel.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Have you an agent?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> No, my Lord; I have applied to two or three, and they have refu&s;ed. I applied to a gentleman to whom I have not had the honour of being long known, but knows me and my connec|tions extremely well, and who would undertake my cau&s;e, but for rea&s;ons which I am not authorized to tell in Court. Mr. Laing is the only gentleman who&s;e refu&s;al I have authority to mention. The two gentlemen I would wi&s;h to employ, are the Dean of Faculty and Mr. Laing with your lord&s;hip's approbation.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> If the Dean of Faculty does not object; but if he &s;hould, he is a gentleman who&s;e attendance we cannot com|pel.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> If the Dean &s;hould refu&s;e, I &s;hall prefer Mr. Fletcher.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> We &s;hall ju&s;t now name Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Laing.</P>
<P><HI>Lord E&s;kgrove.</HI> I think you had better &s;ugge&s;t one or two more, in ca&s;e of any accident, that they cannot attend.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> I feel extremely the indelicacy, and would rather be deprived of the benefit of coun&s;el, than drag any gentleman into an office the duties of which he would reluctantly fulfil.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Even without the interference of the Court, I think no gentleman ought to refu&s;e to defend a pannel, whatever the nature of his crime might be. Now, name another.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> I have the honor of being known to Mr. Gillies.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Will you name a fourth?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> No, my lord; they will be quite &s;ufficient.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Now, name an agent.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> I will leave it to your lord&s;hips, if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="027591_0007_0FD54BD322315F48"><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> No, you mu&s;t name one your&s;elf. Name two, and you will be &s;ure of one or other.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> Mr. James Gib&s;on, and Mr. James Campbell.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Now I am &s;ure you mu&s;t be con&s;cious that you have had all kinds of indulgence; but you mu&s;t be ready next Mon|day.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> As to my&s;elf I am perfectly ready to go on now with the defence which I originally intended to have made.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="day's proceedings">
<HEAD>Monday, March <HI>10, 1794.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Court met agreeable to adjournment, when Mr. Gerrald a|gain placed him&s;elf at the bar. The A&s;&s;ize being called over, and the Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk having de&s;ired him to li&s;ten to his indict|ment,</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald</HI> &s;aid, my Lords, I feel my&s;elf under the painful ne|ce&s;&s;ity of objecting to the Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk &s;itting upon that bench, upon this plea, that his lord&s;hip has deviated from the &s;trict line of his duty, in prejudging that cau&s;e in which my fortune, and my fame, which is more precious to me than life, is actually concerned I beg, therefore, that that <HI>(holding a paper in his hand)</HI> may be made a mi|nute of this Court. My lords I am totally ignorant of the mode of conducting the evidence, and therefore &s;hall rely upon your lord&s;hips candor for &s;etting me right when I am wrong; and I under&s;tand your lord&s;hips are coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner, equally with tho&s;e appoint|ed by the Bench.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Henderland.</HI> You mu&s;t read it.</P>
<P><HI>(Mr. Gerrald then read as follows)</HI></P>
<P>"Jo&s;eph Gerrald &s;tated, that before proceeding to trial upon the criminal letters rai&s;ed again&s;t him, he mu&s;t take the liberty of declin|ing the Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk, as having di&s;qualified him&s;elf from judg|ing in the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, by having prejudged it. In order to &s;how that this objection was not made at random, Jo&s;eph Gerrald of|fered to prove that the Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk had prejudged the cau&s;e of every per&s;on who had been a member of that A&s;&s;embly calling it|&s;elf THE BRITISH CONVENTION; ina&s;much as he had a&s;&s;erted, in the hou&s;e of James Rochead, of Inverleith, that <Q>the Members of the Briti&s;h Convention de&s;erved tran&s;portation for fourteen years, and even public whipping;</Q> and, that when it was objected by a per&s;on pre&s;ent in company, that the people would not patiently endure the inflicting of that puni&s;hment upon the members of the Briti&s;h Convention, the &s;aid Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk replied, <Q>that the mob would be the better for the &s;pilling of a little blood.</Q> I pray that this may be made a minute of the Court.</P>
<P><HI>(The Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk then left the Chair, which was taken by Lord Henderland.)</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lord Henderland.</HI> Have you &s;ub&s;cribed it?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="027591_0008_0FD54BD326646268"><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> No, my lord; I did not know that that was ne|ce&s;&s;ary. <HI>(Sub&s;cribes it.)</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lord Henderland.</HI> Do you wi&s;h to be further heard upon it?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> I de&s;ire to have the matters alledged &s;ub&s;tantiated by evidence.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Henderland.</HI> Your lord&s;hips have heard the minute of the Court, concerning that re&s;pectable judge who has the honor to pre|&s;ide as Vice-Pre&s;ident, in this Court, in the ab&s;ence of the Lord Ju&s;tice General. My lord, it is a thing perfectly new in the an|nals of this Court; nor is there one in&s;tance to be found in our records upon the books of adjournal. My lords, you have heard the nature of the complaint, which is as extraordinary as it is un|precedented; and it will become you, my lords, well to weigh what is the import, and what ought to be the legal effect, of &s;uch an objection offered, in &s;uch extraordinary circum&s;tances, and at &s;o early a period as this. You had it in a different form indeed, in the ca&s;e of Margarot, but you will con&s;ider it in this new form, in this new gui&s;e which it has a&s;&s;umed; you will con&s;ider how far it is important in its nature, or how far it is the &s;ame that was offered in the ca&s;e of Margarot; you are not prohibited from form|ing a different judgment upon it now from what you might have done then; but I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to bring the&s;e matters un|der your lord&s;hips view, before you proceed to give your opinion upon this &s;o unprecedented and extraordinary a minute. It is now &s;ubmitted to your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><HI>Lord E&s;kgrove.</HI> My lords, this objection which comes before your lord&s;hips is a novelty in many re&s;pects; and I don't think this pannel at this bar is well advi&s;ed in making it: what could be his motive for it I cannot perceive. He has the happine&s;s of be|ing tried before one of the able&s;t judges that ever &s;at in this Court; but he is to do as he thinks fit. I am &s;ure he can obtain no be|nefit if he gains the end he has in view; and therefore I cannot perceive his motive, unle&s;s it is an inclination, as far as he can, to throw an indignity upon this Court.</P>
<P>As to the objection, I think there is no validity in it. In a former ca&s;e, an attempt was made to &s;tart the &s;ame objection, by the per&s;on then to be tried. I don't ob&s;erve that this gentle|man &s;ays his name was ever mentioned in that conver&s;ation, or that any thing was &s;aid of him individually; but he &s;ays it was an ex|pre&s;&s;ion, in common conver&s;ation, importing that honorable judge's opinion, that the members of the Briti&s;h Convention &s;hould be tran&s;ported for fourteen years, and even publicly whipped. I do not conceive what intere&s;t this gentleman has in it; he has not yet acknowledged him&s;elf a member of that convention. My lord, one man's conduct may be different from another's in that a&s;&s;em|bly. As to the expre&s;&s;ion, it could only import, hypothetically, that, if that convention was guilty of the crimes &s;tated again&s;t them, of that attempt to overthrow the con&s;titution of their coun|try,
<PB N="9" REF="027591_0009_0FD7BEC52E286FD0">
to create rebellion and in&s;urrection, in the country, then the puni&s;hment adapted to &s;uch an offence, was, in his opinion, tran&s;|portation and public whipping. What is there in that more than in the opinions given in this Court already, in cau&s;es of this kind? My lords, it has been &s;aid by all your lord&s;hips, in this Court, that if the per&s;ons who have been convicted had been brought to trial before the alteration of the trea&s;on law by the union, they would not have been tried as per&s;ons liable to arbitrary puni&s;hment, but recognizable as high trea&s;on; and the per&s;on at the bar under that accu&s;ation would have been tried for his life, and on conviction would have &s;uffered the pains of death and forfeiture. If therefore by an alteration of the criminal law of the land, this crime, which goes to de&s;troy the con&s;titution of the country, is made an arbitrary puni&s;hment, that puni&s;hment mu&s;t be the highe&s;t arbitrary puni&s;h|ment that can be inflicted; and therefore I &s;ee nothing in that opi|nion which imports more than your lord&s;hips have all &s;aid in this Court. I think it was nothing more than a general opinion, given upon the nature of the offence, as charged, that it was a convention of per&s;ons meeting to overturn the happy con&s;titution of this coun|try; and giving his opinion that &s;uch an offence merited that pu|ni&s;hment. I am &s;ure that can be no di&s;qualification from &s;itting in this Court, where the &s;ame opinion has been given by all your lord&s;hips. It is &s;tated here, that it was objected by a per&s;on pre|&s;ent in company, that the mob would not patiently endure the in|fliction of that puni&s;hment. I don't know what could be the mo|tive of any per&s;on to make &s;uch an ob&s;ervation, if they had any rea&s;on to believe &s;uch a thing: for my part, I think it is a mo&s;t erroneous ob&s;ervation; for I have a better opinion of the mob, as it is called, the people of this country, than to think that they are capable of a&s;&s;ociating for acts of violence in defiance of the laws. I think better of the people of this country, than that they would meet together for the purpo&s;e of &s;tirring up in&s;urrection and vio|lence. But, my lord, it is no more than &s;aying this, that a mob, if they &s;hould be &s;o ill-advi&s;ed as to break out into an in&s;urrection, with an intention to overthrow the con&s;titution, they would not merit compa&s;&s;ion, in ca&s;e the magi&s;trates &s;hould be reduced to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;i&s;ting force by force; and that is an ob&s;ervation, which, I dare &s;ay, has been made by a thou&s;and peo|ple be&s;ides his lord&s;hip; and it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that that was to prejudicate the trial of this gentleman, who will by his lord&s;hips and by the Court, be treated as an innocent man, till he is found guilty. My lord, to &s;ay that that is prejudicating him, becau&s;e he &s;poke of puni&s;hment with one exception (a corporal puni&s;hment) which had been inflicted upon per&s;ons who had before been con|victed, is carrying the objection beyond all degree of rea&s;on; and I can a&s;cribe it to nothing but malevolence and&mdash;de&s;peration.</P>

<P><HI>Lord E&s;kgrove.</HI> If I have &s;aid any thing wrong, I will very rea|dily retract what I have &s;aid; but I was making an apology for this objection, that I cannot a&s;cribe it to a &s;olid objection of coun|&s;el, none of whom have &s;tood up to &s;upport it. I meant nothing more by what I was &s;aying; I am very &s;orry for the expre&s;&s;ion I made u&s;e of, and a&s;k the gentleman's pardon; but, upon the whole, I think the objection an irrelevant one.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Swinton.</HI> My lord, an objection of this kind, coming from any other man, I &s;hould con&s;ider as a very high in&s;ult upon the dig|nity of this Court; but, coming from him, &s;tanding in the peculiar &s;ituation in which he now &s;tands at the bar, charged with a crime of little le&s;s than trea&s;on, the in&s;olence of his objection is &s;wallowed up in the atrocity of his crime. He has objected again&s;t a mo&s;t worthy and re&s;pectable judge, that being in a public company at Inverleigh, he &s;aid that the members of the Briti&s;h Convention &s;hould be whip|ped and tran&s;ported; and upon a lady &s;aying the mob would not &s;uf|fer it, his lord&s;hip is &s;aid to have an&s;wered that in that ca&s;e they would de&s;erve to lo&s;e a little blood. It appears to me, that there is not the &s;malle&s;t relevancy in this objection. There is no doubt but there are rea&s;ons why a judge may be declined according to an act of parliament: the law is, that if a judge has any intere&s;t in the cau&s;e, that he can either win or lo&s;e by it, if there is capital enmity between a judge and the party, that might be a good rea&s;on for his being de|clined.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> My lord &mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Lord Henderland.</HI> Once for all, &s;ir, I mu&s;t inform you that you are not entitled to interrupt the judges: if you have any thing to ob|&s;erve, after any one of them is done, you will be permitted to &s;peak; but I de&s;ire you will behave with that decency which becomes you.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> My lord, I re&s;pect the laws of my country, and I &s;hould not re&s;pect my&s;elf if I did not; which I flatter my&s;elf I &s;hall always do: for, I hope, I never &s;hall do any thing which can con&s;titute a ground for &s;elf-degradation in my own opinion: but I &s;poke to his lord&s;hip, becau&s;e I under&s;tood his lord&s;hip had addre&s;&s;ed me, and that was the only rea&s;on of my &s;peaking.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="027591_0011_0FD7BEF16DC4C818"><HI>Lord Swinton.</HI> My lord, I &s;ay there is no relevancy in this ob|jection. If any judge here &s;hall have enmity again&s;t any man whate|ver, &s;tanding at that bar, it might be a good rea&s;on for his being declined; but in this ca&s;e it would be ab&s;urd. I never heard of this man's name in my life, before he came into this country, and I dare &s;ay his lord&s;hip never did; and what intere&s;t he can have ex|cept that of compa&s;&s;ion for a man in that unfortunate &s;ituation. I cannot tell; and I appeal to the feelings of every man; I &s;ay it is impo&s;&s;ible. My lord, there is not the &s;malle&s;t ground to &s;uppo&s;e that this man was prejudicated by that conver&s;ation; and therefore I think the objection is irrelevant.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Dun&s;innan.</HI> My lords, this objection is new, and not a little extraordinary; it very much &s;urpri&s;ed me. I &s;hall enter into no ob|&s;ervations upon his conduct; and I think your lord&s;hips ought to pay no attention to it, either in one &s;hape or another.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Abercrombie.</HI> My lords, as to the objection made by this pannel&mdash;if a judge is guilty of a breach of the &s;acred tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, he is amenadable to the laws of his country, and may be impeach|ed for the offence; he may be puni&s;hed for it, and the law of this country has provided again&s;t it; but, my lord, that is not the &s;hape in which this objection comes before you; it comes in the &s;hape of a di&s;qualification. Now, my lords, I know of no circum&s;tance whate|ver which can di&s;qualify a judge from &s;itting to di&s;charge his duty, except tho&s;e in the act of parliament. But, my lord, this objection applies equally to every judge who &s;its here. Sure I am, that upon every occa&s;ion when I have had an opportunity of giving my opinion upon the &s;ubject, I have never he&s;itated to &s;ay that I con&s;idered the Briti&s;h Convention as a con&s;piracy of a mo&s;t dangerous and of a mo&s;t criminal nature.</P>
<P>My <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, with regard to the unhappy man at the bar, there is not a doubt that the pre&s;umption of law is in his favour; he is pre|&s;umed to be innocent of the charges laid again&s;t him, till he is found guilty by a verdict of his country. But I have no he&s;itation in &s;ay|ing now, in the pre&s;ence of that man, in the pre&s;ence of his coun&s;el, and in the pre&s;ence of this audience, and of your lord&s;hips, that if he &s;hould be convicted of the crime charged again&s;t him in this indict|ment, I &s;hall &s;ay that even fourteen years tran&s;portation is too &s;light a puni&s;hment for an offence of &s;uch magnitude. My lord, in the ca&s;e of Margarot I had a doubt, but that doubt was whether four|teen years tran&s;portation was not too &s;light a puni&s;hment for the of|fence, aggravated as it was by a variety of circum&s;tances, and in par|ticular, by the very improper and indecent conduct of that man to the Court in the cour&s;e of his trial; which, for his own &s;ake, I hope the pannel now at the bar will not do.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Henderland.</HI> Your lord&s;hips have delivered your opinions &s;o fully, and placed this que&s;tion in &s;o many different point of view, and expre&s;&s;ed your&s;elves in &s;o much better language than I can do, that it would be highly improper in me to go over the &s;ame grounds

again; I &s;hall only &s;ay that I perfectly agree in the opinion of the Court, that this objection is not well founded. My lords, it appears to have been a tran&s;ient conver&s;ation, with re&s;pect to the crime of &s;edition, and the puni&s;hment due to it: but is that to be the ground of declining a judge? I appeal to he feelings of any man who has conver&s;ed upon the &s;ubject; I appeal to every juryman who has tried the&s;e ca&s;es; I appeal to every juryman who will try the&s;e ca&s;es; would he think him&s;elf bound in the &s;malle&s;t degree by &s;uch a con|ver&s;ation? would he think the ca&s;e prejudged one iota? would he think him&s;elf hindered from examining the evidence, or from weigh|ing the arguments with the greate&s;t firmne&s;s, and with the utmo&s;t accuracy? I am &s;ure he would not. To &s;ay that the&s;e words &s;hall be held by this Court as a prejudication of any judge or juryman (for I know not how far the objection may go) might lead to the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences, for ought I know, I don't &s;ay it is &s;o, but it might go even to the exclu&s;ion of all trials. My lords, taking it in this point of view, the words &s;aid to be expre&s;&s;ed in the manner in which they were expre&s;&s;ed, and the occa&s;ion upon which they were expre&s;&s;ed, mu&s;t all go together; and it is admitted they are &s;o far fairly told you. It is not &s;aid that this was a judicial opinion given by this learned judge, and therefore was not any thing like a prejudication of what he might do in this Court; and we are to judge, whether by fair inference it ought to be held &s;o, whether by con&s;ulting the common &s;en&s;e of all mankind, for that is the te&s;t of all criminality. And here, my lord, a re&s;pectable judge, an honour to his profe&s;&s;ion and abilities, whom I know to be a man of the highe&s;t honor and &s;tricte&s;t integrity, is to be tried before us; for we are his jury, and we are called upon by our great oaths, as judges, and lying our hands upon our hearts, to &s;ay that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;pect|able judge, by what is here alledged, is no be rendered i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">pable of &s;itting in this chair&mdash;to be degraded from his office, and held unfit to judge in the mo&s;t important trials in this country; where his abi|lities, &s;teadine&s;s, and knowledge in law, are mo&s;t required&mdash;I cannot go &s;uch a length&mdash;I think it is contrary to law; and that therefore the objection is irrelevant.</P>

<P>Whatever difference of opinion may ari&s;e within the&s;e walls, I &s;uppo&s;e we have all one common object in view: we all live under the &s;ame form of government, have the &s;ame grievances to complain of, and &s;eek the &s;ame redre&s;s. It was ju&s;tly ob&s;erv|ed by Citizen Callander, That, &s;oon after the union of the crowns of England and Scotland, the people of both countries were de|prived of &s;ome of their mo&s;t valuable privileges. It was from that period that the greate&s;t encroachments began to be made on public liberty; but, if that union has operated to rob us of our rights, let it be the object of the pre&s;ent one to regain them. if the event exi&s;ts for our &s;hame, as it has exi&s;ted for our cha&s;|ti&s;ement, let it al&s;o exi&s;t for our in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Some doubts have been introduced re&s;pecting our right to u|niver&s;al &s;uffrage. I apprehend that we may ju&s;tly claim it as our inheritance from nature; but we can with confidence, be|cau&s;e we can with truth, appeal to antiquity for our title to this right; and it will be found to have been exerci&s;ed by our an|ce&s;tors in its fulle&s;t extent. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, however, that, in the early periods of our hi&s;tory, there exi&s;ted a body of men called Slaves: happily, this di&s;tinction does not exi&s;t in our days; and, if there are political &s;laves, it is time that they &s;hould ex|i&s;t no longer.</P>
<P>In e&s;tabli&s;hing the right of univer&s;al &s;uffrage, the Convention may perhaps give offence to the &s;attelites of de&s;poti&s;m; but, while we can e&s;tabli&s;h our demand on the immutable principles of ju&s;tice, we may at the &s;ame time prove, that it is perfectly a|greeable to the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Under the Saxon Government, the people met frequently in the different divi&s;ions of the country, in a&s;&s;emblies called Folk|motes. There they deliberated; there every man had a voice in choo&s;ing his repre&s;entatives; the concurrence of the people was nece&s;&s;ary to the admini&s;tration of government; and they o|beyed the laws which them&s;elves had made. The King of Eng|land u&s;ed to &s;it in the Folkmote; and, I believe, it would be more to his own advantage if he &s;at there now.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of time, however, great deviations have been made from the original purity of the con&s;titution, and the nati|onal
<PB N="15" REF="027591_0015_0FD7BEBDB1177588">
repre&s;entation has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ometimes influenc|ed by motives not altogether congenial to the happine&s;s of the people. Human nature is &s;o con&s;tituted, that every man is inclined to pur&s;ue his own individual intere&s;t in preference to that of others. If you appoint a man to act as your agent, and make his &s;ituation &s;uch that he has every temptation to betray you without incurring the danger of being called to an account, the probability is, that he will &s;acrifice your intere&s;ts to his own. It is therefore that a free &s;uffrage of the people is what every man ought to de&s;ire, as that alone can make the intere&s;t of the repre&s;entative and his con&s;tituent the &s;ame. The great art of government, I apprehend, is this, that all &s;hould be governed by all; but unhappy is the country where men are called upon by every intere&s;t to act in oppo&s;ition to their duty.</P>
<P>Much, of late has been &s;aid about meetings of mobs. I appre|hend that no meeting of the people can be called a mob, if their deliberations be directed towards the public good; but if men meet for an oppo&s;ite purpo&s;e, for promoting the mi&s;ery or the de|&s;truction of the human race, though they &s;hould &s;it with crowns on their heads and &s;ceptres in their hands, they are truly a mob.</P>
<P>Were all mankind to a&s;&s;emble in public meetings, one of two things mu&s;t follow; either they will behave properly or impro|perly; if properly, their meeting will tend to good; if impro|perly, it carries its own cure along with it. The people will be &s;oon brought into a better method by a &s;en&s;e of &s;elf-pre&s;er|vation, by which they will correct the errors into which they have fallen.</P>
<P><Q>It may occur, that the voice of the people may be wrong when their under&s;tandings are perverted by prie&s;tcraft, or darkened by political &s;uper&s;tition, like the voice once heard in Jeru&s;alem, of <HI>crucify him! crucify him!</HI> when that nefarious deed was perpe|trated, at which the &s;un hid his head in darkne&s;s and in blood. But, were the tyrants of the earth as &s;olicitous to enlighten as they are to puni&s;h their unfortunate &s;ubjects; were governments to in&s;truct the poor, in&s;tead of hanging up their bodies on gib|bets; the voice of the people would then be the voice of God.</Q></P>
<P>By the Norman Conque&s;t, or rather Robbery, (for that tran&s;ac|tion, like every other, is to be con&s;idered by its con&s;equences) the right of voting was greatly curtailed; but &s;urely we can, with great propriety, meet to petition Parliament for the re&s;toration of the right of univer&s;al &s;uffrage; a right which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the ju&s;t admini&s;tration of government; for, if any man comes and tells me that I mu&s;t pay a tax to which I have never con&s;ented, neither by my&s;elf nor my repre&s;entative, What am I think of the legality of his claim? Whenever money is taken from the people by a mi|litary power, or by any other authority not delegated by them&s;elves,
<PB N="16" REF="027591_0016_0FD7BEC3AFE7E2B0">
call that government what you will, it is a government of force&mdash;it is the &s;word which governs. The right then, of univer&s;al &s;uffrage, of which we have been &s;o unfortunately and unju&s;tly deprived, I repeat, is not only a natural right, but an inherent principle of the con&s;titution. In the early periods, every man had a vote for his repre&s;entative. With &s;ome little variation, the practice continued for ages; it underwent con&s;iderable alterations at the Conque&s;t; a period at which the goodly fabric of Anglo-Saxon government was undermined, and the &s;tructure of tyranny erected in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that the Revolution of 1688 does not pro|duce the advantages which might have been expected from &s;uch an event. It is true, that, at the Revolution, univer&s;al &s;uffrage was not di&s;pen&s;ed to the people with that liberality which it ought to have been; but &s;till the pre&s;ent form of government, in my opi|nion, no more re&s;embles the Revolution, than a dead putrid carca&s;e does a living body.</P>
<P>The principal advantage of the Revolution was, that it made the chief magi&s;trate re&s;pon&s;ible for his tru&s;t, by e&s;tabli&s;hing the right of the people to alter the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne. The Hou&s;e of Hanover, if they are wi&s;e, will not be aver&s;e to revolu|tion principles; for it is in con&s;equence of tho&s;e principles that the pre&s;ent monarch reigns in Britain. A worthy member, I believe with the be&s;t of intentions, called another to order, and &s;aid he was going to far:&mdash;no man, I apprehend, goes <HI>too far,</HI> unle&s;s he goes beyond the rule of right&mdash;unle&s;s he violates the truth. If the mem|bers who compo&s;e a government abu&s;e their tru&s;t, May they not be re&s;i&s;ted? And, if there exi&s;ted a right in any preceding gene|ration to amend the con&s;titution, Can it be &s;aid that that right does not equally belong to the pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>Let us then endeavour to in&s;truct the people in their rights, and to inform them of our views and our intentions; they will come and &s;ign our petitions, and we &s;hall be enabled to &s;end them up &s;ub&s;cribed by a majority of the people. The voice of the people will be heard, whenever it is &s;poken in the language of truth, and by a number &s;o re&s;pectable as to <HI>command</HI> attention; and it will &s;oon have that re&s;pectability, if we have rea&s;on on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>As to the manner in which the union is to be formed, we may find precedents for it in our early hi&s;tory; but the fir&s;t thing to be done, is to enlighten the people;&mdash;endeavour to diffu&s;e the principle on which you act.

what per&s;ons they chu&s;e for delegates to the next convention: let them be plain men, &s;uch as I &s;ee here;&mdash;none who have ever breathed the pe&s;tilential air of a court&mdash;or bowed the knee to ari|&s;tocracy. Let us renounce all attachment to parties, and be no more deceived by the pretended patrioti&s;m of the great. During the American war, reformers and patriots &s;prung up like mu&s;h|rooms, without any diminution of public burdens. Like mu&s;hrooms they were &s;hort-lived; for they &s;prung from a &s;oil of dung, a <HI>bot|bed</HI> of corruption. Pitt has &s;ucceeded to Fox, and Fox to Pitt, without any reform being obtained; but let us no longer put faith in &s;uch men, unle&s;s they bring forward a reform founded on annu|al parliaments and univer&s;al &s;uffrage:&mdash;that only is the kind of re|form which will &s;atisfy the people, and which they will never cea&s;e to claim as their due. Depend upon it, whenever the leaders of parties &s;ee that the people are determined upon having their rights, they will not only endeavour to &s;wim along the &s;tream, but will &s;trive to direct its cour&s;e. Tru&s;t them not&mdash;they did not come forward in the hour of public danger;&mdash;Why then &s;hould they be tru&s;ted, when they &s;eek your favour only for per&s;onal conveni|ence?</P>
<P><Q>The city of York has been propo&s;ed as a proper and centrical place for the meeting of next convention; but I can a&s;&s;ure you that city is the &s;eat of a proud ari&s;tocracy, the &s;eat of an archbi&s;hop; however, I would not object to going there; as the Saviour of the world was often found in the company of &s;inners, let us go there for the &s;ame gracious purpo&s;e, to convert to repentance. The bor|ders of this country and England were mentioned by another mem|ber, and I &s;hould rather prefer &s;ome place there; for we &s;hould have this plea&s;ing reflection, that we meet for promoting philan|thropy and peace, on the ground which had often been drenched with the blood of our ance&s;tors. Let us then, fellow citizens, u|nite heart and hand to bury the hatchet of natural antipathy, which the wicked policy of courts once in&s;tigated us to wield. Let us brighten the chain of national friend&s;hip. Let there be no other wi&s;h, either among Scots or Engli&s;h, than to obtain freedom, and no other rival&s;hip, than who &s;hall be&s;t de&s;erve it.</Q></P>
<P>FURTHER, at a meeting of the &s;aid a&s;&s;ociation, upon the 25th day of the &s;aid month of November 1793, or on &s;ome one or other of the days of that month, or of the months afore&s;aid, within the room or Ma&s;on-lodge afore&s;aid, Alexander Callender, one of the members, having made a motion of the following or &s;imilar tenor, "That in ca&s;e the mini&s;ter, or any other member of either Hou&s;e of Parliament, bring forward a motion for leave to bring in a Con|vention Bill, &s;uch as has pa&s;&s;ed in Ireland, to prevent the people from meeting according to their ju&s;t rights by the Revolution, the &s;ame motion &s;hall be notice to the delegates to meet in convention, to a&s;&s;ert their rights;" the &s;aid motion was made the &s;ubject of di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion in the &s;aid meeting, on the 27th day of the &s;aid month, or on
<PB N="18" REF="027591_0018_0FD7BEC22E124BD8">
one or other of the days of that month, or the months afore&s;aid, when &s;undry amendments, of a wicked and &s;editious tendency were propo&s;ed; and the &s;aid motion, with the amendments, hav|ing been, by the &s;aid meeting, referred to &s;ome of the members thereof as a committee, to draw up a motion from the whole, Charles Sinclair, one of the members of the &s;aid committee, did, upon the 28th day of the &s;aid month of November, or on one or other of the days of that month, or of the months afore&s;aid, read to the &s;aid a&s;&s;ociation or meeting, when a&s;&s;embled within the room or Ma&s;on-lodge afore&s;aid, the amendments upon the &s;aid motion, as agreed on by him and the committee afore&s;aid; when the &s;aid a&s;|&s;ociation or meeting did wickedly and feloniou&s;ly, then and there, all the members &s;tanding on their feet, &s;olemnly and unanimou&s;ly come to a re&s;olution of the following import or tenor:</P>
<P>"That this convention, con&s;idering the calamitous con&s;equences of any act of the legi&s;lature which may tend to deprive the whole, or any part of the people, of their undoubted right to meet, ei|ther by them&s;elves or by delegation, to di&s;cu&s;s any matter relative to their common intere&s;t, whether of a public or private nature, and holding the &s;ame to be totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the fir&s;t principles and &s;afety of &s;ociety, and al&s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of our own and acknow|ledged con&s;titutional liberties, do hereby declare, before God and the world, that we &s;hall follow the whole&s;ome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which &s;hall militate again&s;t the con&s;titution of our country; and &s;hall continue to a&s;&s;emble, and con&s;ider of the be&s;t means by which we can accompli&s;h a real repre&s;entation of the people, and annual election, until compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force.</P>
<P>And we do re&s;olve,</P>
<P>That the fir&s;t notice given for the introduction of a Convention Bill, or any bill of a &s;imilar tendency to that pa&s;&s;ed in Ireland, in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of their parliament;</P>
<P>Or any bill for the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the <HI>Habeas Corpus Act,</HI> or <HI>the act for preventing</HI> wrongous impri&s;onment, and again&s;t undue delays in trials in North Britain;</P>
<P>Or in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion;</P>
<P>Or the admi&s;&s;ion of any foreign troops what&s;oever into Great Britain or Ireland; all, or any one, of the&s;e calamitous circum|&s;tances, &s;hall be a &s;ignal to the different delegates to repair to &s;uch place as the Secret Committee of this convention &s;hall appoint; and the fir&s;t &s;even members &s;hall have power to declare the <HI>&s;ittings permanent;</HI> and twenty-one &s;hall con&s;titute a convention, and pro|ceed to bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The convention doth therefore re&s;olve, That each delegate, im|mediately on his return home, do convene his con&s;tituents, and ex|plain to them the nece&s;&s;ity of electing a delegate, or delegates, and of e&s;tabli&s;hing a fund without delay, again&s;t any of the&s;e emer|gencies, for his or their expence; and that they do in&s;truct the &s;aid
<PB N="19" REF="027591_0019_0FD7BEF5EDBBE6A8">
delegate or delegates, to hold them&s;elves ready to depart at one hour's warn-ing."</P>
<P>Which &s;editious re&s;olution the &s;aid Jo&s;eph Gerrald not only ap|proved of, but immediately, on its being &s;o agreed to and pa&s;&s;ed, did, on the day, and within the place afore&s;aid, wickedly and felo|niou&s;ly addre&s;s the &s;aid meeting or a&s;&s;ociation, in a &s;peech of the following or &s;imilar import.</P>
<P>"I ri&s;e to congratulate the convention on the adoption of this re&s;olution, not only on the propriety of the mea&s;ure it&s;elf, but on that unanimity and &s;olemnity with which it has pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have not been able to procure a copy of the iniquitous act which has excited &s;uch abhorence; but I have here the heads of the bill in the &s;peech of Mr. Grattan, the man who, while he &s;poke again&s;t the bill, at the &s;ame time betrayed the liberties of his coun|try. This bill, commonly called the Convention Bill, which pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the Parliament of Ireland, and which is the prototype of what may be attempted in Britain, breathes &s;uch a &s;pirit of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, that if tyranny were to be per&s;onified, it could not &s;peak in language more in&s;ulting to the feelings of mankind.</P>
<P>By the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> head the delegates of the people are not allowed to meet to petition Parliament. Surely de&s;poti&s;m could not be more &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed even in Turkey. There every Ba&s;haw li&s;tens to the petitions of his trembling &s;laves; yet that privilege is deni|ed to the people of Ireland. But it has been &s;aid, to u&s;e a com|mon expre&s;&s;ion, this bill was fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed in Ireland to feel the pul&s;e of the people of Britain, that our rulers might know if it beat high with indignation, or if the blood run coldly in our veins; and we are willing to bow our necks to the yoke, and &s;uffer in fear and in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> head, they are forbidden to meet for the purpo&s;e of a&s;king the redre&s;s of grievances. Good God! What is govern|ment in&s;tituted for, if it is not for the redre&s;s of grievances? I had thought that in the mo&s;t de&s;potic government the people were per|mitted to utter their complaints, and beg to be relieved of their &s;ufferings; but, at the clo&s;e of the 18th century, we find this la&s;t indulgence to &s;laves denied to a part of the Briti&s;h empire. Our government boa&s;ts that it is the be&s;t in the world; but it is not in Ireland that we are to look for its excellencies. When|ever a government tells the people that they mu&s;t not petition, that government is tyranny; and whatever you may be told of its acts of Parliament in favour of liberty, the&s;e acts of Parlia|ment are &s;et a&s;ide; they are mere pieces of parchment, and of no more value.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> head makes it a capital offence to con&s;ider of any pub|lic concern. Now, to make a road, or build a bridge, are public concerns; and of cour&s;e the people of Ireland cannot meet on bu&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="20" REF="027591_0020_0FD7BEF76EAD4F70">
of that nature, without making them&s;elves liable to the penal|ty of this law.</P>
<P>Though I could not get a copy of this bill, the heads, which I have read, are &s;ufficiently explanatory of its dete&s;table principles; and I hope the mea&s;ure which has pa&s;&s;ed this night will convince the mini&s;ter, that we are determined to guard again&s;t every at|tempt that may be made to deprive us of our rights; and though by &s;ome it may be <HI>thought a bold, by &s;ome a daring mea&s;ure,</HI> yet it will be found the be&s;t for &s;ecuring the peace of our country: for if &s;uch a law were &s;uffered to pa&s;s, if men were not allowed to ut|ter their complaints, a number of fierce and rancorous pa&s;&s;ions world ari&s;e, and we would &s;eek to appeal to that la&s;t terrible deci&s;ion, the event of which is uncertain, but which God and nature allows.</P>
<P>If the &s;ervility of the people had been le&s;s; if they had dared to meet, and, in place of murmuring, to have told their rulers that there was danger in &s;eeking to deprive them of their liberties, we would not have had to adopt this re&s;olution to night; but when I &s;aw the calm deliberate countenances of all pre&s;ent, and the &s;olemn manner in which it was pa&s;&s;ed, I was convinced that it would not only be a re&s;olution of words, but a rule of action."</P>
<P>AND FURTHER, upon the &s;aid 28th day of November, or one or other of the days of that month, or months afore&s;aid, and within the room or Ma&s;on's-lodge afore&s;aid, after the fore&s;aid re&s;o|lution had been &s;o pa&s;&s;ed, and the fore&s;aid &s;peech &s;o made by the &s;aid Jo&s;eph Gerrald, a motion having been made in the &s;aid meeting, in the following words, or in words of a &s;imilar import and ten|dency: <Q>That a Secret Committee of three and the Secretary be appointed to determine where &s;uch Convention of Emergency &s;hall meet: That &s;uch place &s;hall remain a &s;ecret with them and with the Secretary of this Convention: And that each delegate &s;hall, at the breaking up of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, be entru&s;ted with a &s;ealed letter, containing the name of the place of meeting: This letter &s;hall be delivered unopened to his con&s;tituents; the receipt of which &s;hall be acknowledged by a letter to the Secre|tary, pre&s;erved in the &s;ame &s;tate, until the period &s;hall arrive at which it &s;hall be deemed nece&s;&s;ary for the delegates to &s;et out;</Q> the &s;aid meeting did wickedly and &s;editiou&s;ly unanimou&s;ly approve of the &s;ame. AND at a &s;ub&s;equent meeting, upon the 4th day of December 1793, or one or other of the days of that month, or months afore&s;aid, and within the &s;aid room or ma&s;ons-lodge afore|&s;aid, it having been moved by Maurice Margarot one of the mem|bers of the &s;aid meeting, <Q>That the moment of any illegal di&s;per|&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Convention, &s;hall be con&s;idered as a &s;ummons to the delegates to repair to the place of meeting, appointed for the Convention of Emergency, by the &s;ecret committee; and that the Secret Committee be in&s;tructed to proceed without de|lay to fix the place of meeting&punc;</Q> the &s;aid meeting did wickedly and &s;editou&s;ly, <Q>unanimou&s;ly re&s;olve the &s;ame, and appointed the
<PB N="21" REF="027591_0021_0FD54C001D9136C0">
Secret Committee to proceed as de&s;ired.</Q> AND FURTHER, on Friday the 6th day of December 1793, or upon one or other of the days of that month, or of the months afore&s;aid, the &s;aid illegal a&s;&s;ociation or meeting having again a&s;&s;embled in a room or work|&s;hop belonging to, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by, John Laing, wright, &s;ituated in Lady Law&s;on's Yard, &s;outh &s;ide of Cro&s;scau&s;eway, in the pari&s;h of St. Cuthbert's and &s;hire of Edinburgh, Harry David&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> She|riff-&s;ub&s;titute of Edinburgh, having, in di&s;charge of his duty, re|paired to the &s;aid room or work-&s;hop, in order to di&s;per&s;e the &s;aid illegal meeting, the &s;aid Jo&s;eph Gerrald, with his a&s;&s;ociates, did then and there re&s;i&s;t the &s;aid Sheriff-&s;ub&s;titute, and refu&s;ed to di&s;|per&s;e without being compelled; and &s;o much &s;o, that after the &s;aid Sheriff-&s;ub&s;titute had entered the room, and de&s;ired them to di&s;|per&s;e, the &s;aid Jo&s;eph Gerrald wickedly and feloniou&s;ly exclaimed, <Q>The rights of Britons are violated by this illegal interruption of our peaceful meeting. It is force, not rea&s;on, with which our enemies a&s;&s;ail us. I defy them to a&s;&s;ign one rea&s;on again&s;t the lawfulne&s;s of our meetings; but if they thir&s;t after our blood, they may now gratify them&s;elves; mine I &s;hall &s;ee flow with plea&s;ure, if with it flows the freedom of my country.</Q> AT LEAST, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in language of the above import; and did afterwards take the chair as pre&s;es of the meeting, and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly did continue to &s;it and act, until he was, by the &s;aid Sheriff-&s;ub&s;titute pulled from the chair; which conduct of the &s;aid Jo&s;eph Gerrald was highly aggravated, from the circum|&s;tance that the &s;aid illegal a&s;&s;ociation had been, the preceding day, di&s;per&s;ed by the magi&s;trates of Edinburgh, as being illegal; and al&s;o, that the &s;aid Jo&s;eph Gerrald had, the preceding day, been ap|prehended on a warrant of the &s;aid Sheriff-&s;ub&s;titute, and ordered to be committed to jail, for being a member of the &s;aid illegal a&s;|&s;ociation, till liberate in due cour&s;e of law. And the &s;aid Jo&s;eph Gerrald, when apprehended and carried before Harry David&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Sheriff-&s;ub&s;titute of the county of Edinburgh, on the 5th of December 1793, did, in his pre&s;ence, emit and &s;ign a declaration. And &s;undry papers having been found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid Jo&s;eph Gerrald when fir&s;t apprehended and afterwards in&s;pected in his pre&s;ence, by authority of the Sheriff of Edinburgh, two li&s;ts or inventories of the&s;e papers were made up; one of which, con&s;i&s;ting of ten articles, &s;ub&s;cribed by the &s;aid Jo&s;eph Gerrald, and William Scott, Procurator-fi&s;cal of the county of Edinburgh; and the other, of nine articles, is &s;ub&s;cribed by the &s;aid William Scott and the Sheriff-&s;ub&s;titute. Which inventories, with the whole articles therein contained, (except No, 1. which had been returned to the &s;aid Jo&s;eph Gerrald;) as al&s;o, the fore&s;aid declaration emitted by him before the Sheriff-&s;ub&s;titute of Edinburgh; together with copies of Nos. 78, 79, and 80, of the new&s;paper called, <Q>The Edinburgh Gazetteer;</Q> as al&s;o, the &s;croll or draught of the Minutes of the &s;aid General Convention, from the 29th of Octo|ber

<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Jo&s;eph Gerrald, what do you &s;ay to this? Are you guilty, or not guilty?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> Not guilty, my lord.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gilles.</HI> My lords, in a ca&s;e like the pre&s;ent, which has been pleaded by coun&s;el of the very fir&s;t eminence, and which has alrea|dy received the &s;olemn con&s;ideration of this Court, it is a difficult ta&s;k for any coun&s;el, and e&s;pecially for a young coun&s;el, to go over the &s;ame grounds again, and that too with the view of directly and &s;trongly maintaining that other views ought to have guided your lord&s;hips judgment formerly, and that other views ought to guide it now. Added to this, is that firmly rooted and wide &s;pread notion of the guilt of all tho&s;e that &s;tand at this bar accu&s;ed of &s;edition. The temper of men's minds, from many obvious cau&s;es, is &s;uch, that they con&s;ider a per&s;on at this bar under this accu&s;ation, as already con|demned&mdash;that it is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to plead for <HI>him,</HI> except as going through the forms, while he, who&s;e fortune it is to undertake &s;uch a cau&s;e, is con&s;idered as an effect, a &s;harer of the crimes imputed to him whom he defends, and by <HI>doing</HI> his duty, may incur all the con&s;e|quences that ought only to follow his not doing it.&mdash;As to the pan|nel, thus brought before you, the public eye con&s;iders them as the per&s;onal enemies of us all.&mdash;They do not aim, as we are taught to
<PB N="25" REF="027591_0025_0FD54C045CD10F58">
think, at the ruin of this or that individual&mdash;we have not merely a remote intere&s;t in their de&s;truction, but it is ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to our own per&s;onal &s;afety. Our properties, our lives, our all, are re|pre&s;ented as the objects of their violence, and again&s;t danger &s;o near, and danger &s;o dreadful, we &s;hould not be &s;crupulous about our means of defence. The &s;tronge&s;t feelings of our nature, tho&s;e of &s;elf pre|&s;ervation it&s;elf, are thus called into in&s;tant energy among&s;t us all. It is difficult in &s;uch circum&s;tances to judge right; and the difficulties are altogether on another &s;ide from what takes place commonly. In the common ca&s;e the chief danger is of inju&s;tice ari&s;ing from compa&s;|&s;ion and mercy. <HI>Here</HI> the danger is of inju&s;tice being done, (unwil|lingly done yet done effectually) from motives of fear, and of anger again&s;t tho&s;e who have cau&s;ed that fear. In &s;uch a ca&s;e it behoves us to examine our&s;elves; to be &s;ure of the grounds upon which we proceed to bani&s;h the lea&s;t appearance of pa&s;&s;ion; and to renounce a judgment, however deliberately con&s;idered, if an after delibera|tion &s;how it to be even doubtful. It is impo&s;&s;ible to deliberate too much.</P>
<P>Knowing well that in the&s;e re&s;pects your lord&s;hips think exactly as I do, and encouraged by this con&s;ideration, I &s;hall go on to &s;tate, as well as I can, &s;uch arguments as have occurred to me in favour of the unfortunate gentleman who &s;tands at your lord&s;hips' bar. I hope to &s;hew your lord&s;hips that the indictment is <HI>altogether</HI> irrelevant, at a|ny rate that it is irrelevant to infer <HI>that puni&s;hment</HI> which has been in|flicted in the other ca&s;es of &s;edition.</P>
<P>The crime charged, in the major propo&s;ition of this indictment, <HI>is &s;edition,</HI> in vague and general terms&mdash;I know very well that by the laws of this country, explained as they are, and ought to be, by the practice of this Court, the crime in this part of the indictment may be charged in <HI>general</HI> terms. I know that many crimes are &s;o: in the ca&s;es of robbery and murder; for in&s;tance, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate the&s;e crimes particularly, or to refer to the &s;tatutes, which pro|hibit the commi&s;&s;ion and affix the puni&s;hment due to the&s;e offences. But where the law has annexed different degrees of puni&s;hment, to different &s;pecies or degrees of the &s;ame offence, then if the crime is charged in general in the major propo&s;ition of the indictment, the <HI>lea&s;t culpable &s;pecies</HI> of the offence mu&s;t be meant, and the <HI>le&s;&s;er pu|ni&s;hment</HI> only can be inflicted. Thus, in the ca&s;e of theft, &s;imple theft is not a capital crime, but if aggravated by hou&s;e-breaking it is puni&s;hed with death. Now, if theft is charged generally without tins aggravation, the arbitrary puni&s;hment due to the offence of &s;im|ple theft is all that your lord&s;hips can award. In the &s;ame manner with regard to &s;edition, I believe it is laid down by every writer of eminence, that there are <HI>two &s;pecies</HI> of &s;edition, <HI>verbal,</HI> and <HI>real</HI>&mdash; a <HI>&s;maller</HI> and <HI>greater</HI> offence, to which our laws have annexed two different degrees of puni&s;hment. The puni&s;hment of the fir&s;t offence, verbal &s;edition, is fixed by a &s;tatute which I &s;hall afterwards men|tion
<PB N="26" REF="027591_0026_0FD7BECCADCCCAE0">
particularly; and as &s;edition is charged generally in this indict|ment, the le&s;&s;er offence mu&s;t be under&s;tood. Upon this ground alone, I tru&s;t the puni&s;hment mu&s;t be re&s;tricted to the le&s;&s;er &s;pecies of the crime, for if it was intended to accu&s;e this gentleman of a greater of|fence, the greater offence ought to have been &s;tated; it cannot, therefore, be con&s;trued into any thing more than verbal &s;edition, or lea&s;ing-making, and the le&s;&s;er degree of puni&s;hment can only be inflicted.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t from this argument that it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as verbal &s;e|dition. It will at lea&s;t be admitted, that where a crime is charged in general, the <HI>degree</HI> and <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> mu&s;t be gathered from the <HI>particu|lars</HI> charged in the minor propo&s;ition. The que&s;tions, therefore, now to be &s;ubmitted to your lord&s;hips' con&s;ideration are the&s;e,</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place&mdash;Whether the facts &s;tated in the minor propo&s;i|tion, amount to any crime at all&mdash;whether they amount to <HI>&s;edition of any kind whatever?</HI></P>
<P>In the next place&mdash;Whether, if they are criminal, they amount to verbal or real &s;edition, and if they amount only to verbal &s;edition, what is the puni&s;hment affixed by our law to <HI>that</HI> crime?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t charge in the indictment is, that "the &s;aid Jo&s;eph Ger|rald, above complained upon, has pre&s;umed to commit, and is guilty actor, or art and part, of the afore&s;aid crime, in &s;o far as, a number of &s;editious and evil di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons having illegally a&s;&s;embled at E|dinburgh, during the months of October, November, and December, 1793, the &s;aid Jo&s;eph Gerrald, above complained upon did come into this country, for the purpo&s;e of joining and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the&s;e per&s;ons, and became a member of their illegal and &s;editious a&s;&s;ociation and meeting; which illegal and &s;editious a&s;&s;ociation and meeting, at fir&s;t a&s;&s;embled under the de&s;ignation of a General Convention of the Friends of the People, but thereafter, pre&s;umptuou&s;ly and &s;editiou&s;ly, a&s;&s;umed the name of the Briti&s;h Convention of the Delegates of the People, a&s;&s;ociated to obtain Univer&s;al Suffrage and Annual Parlia|ments."</P>
<P>My lord, the illegality and &s;edition laid to the charge of the Bri|ti&s;h Convention, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t either in the <HI>meeting it&s;elf</HI> being illegal, or it mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in the illegality of the <HI>object</HI> which they had in view&mdash;that is, the obtaining Univer&s;al Suffrage and Annual Parlia|ments, a Reform in the Repre&s;entation of the Commons Hou&s;e of Parliament.</P>
<P>Setting a&s;ide the object of the convention, the fir&s;t que&s;tion is, whether &s;uch a meeting is or is not legal? whether it is allowed, or, whether it is puni&s;hable by the laws of this country? Laying out of con&s;ideration the object which they had in view, the que&s;tion affects <HI>every one</HI> who hears me; for who is there among&s;t us who has not been pre&s;ent at &s;ome convocation without legal authority? If this is to be puni&s;hed as &s;edition, every one pre&s;ent is liable to that pu|ni&s;hment. The actions of the&s;e men &s;o a&s;&s;embled together, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall &s;peak afterwards of their &s;peeches and re&s;olutions, but I &s;ay their
<PB N="27" REF="027591_0027_0FD7BED36DCB6F38">
actions) were inoffen&s;ive and orderly; they are not accu&s;ed even of the <HI>&s;lighte&s;t bread of the peace.</HI> No doubt that by the ancient &s;ta|tutes of this country, convocations within boroughs were prohibited, but what was the nature of tho&s;e convocations will appear from the &s;tatutes them&s;elves. I &s;hall therefore read the Act 1563. chap. 83. "It is, &s;tatute and ordained that nane of our &s;overaine ladie's lieges pre&s;ume, pretende or take upon hand to make onie privie conventi|ones nor a&s;&s;emblies within burgh, put on armour, cleeith them&s;elves with weapons, or make &s;ound of trumpet, or talbrone or u&s;e culver|inges, di&s;played banners, hand &s;eingies, or uthers in&s;truments bellical quhat-&s;umever in onie time hereafter, without the &s;pecial licence of our &s;aid &s;overaine lady and her hienes' magi&s;trates within the burgh quhair the &s;aid tumult and uproar chauncis to be had and obtained thereto, under the paine of death." Sir Geo. Mackenzie, in his ob&s;ervation upon this act, &s;ays, "It &s;eems that mere convocations or a&s;&s;emblies are not <HI>per &s;e</HI> puni&s;hable by death, without putting on ar|mour or di&s;playing banners." Thus, in order to bring the Briti&s;h Convention within this enactment, its members mu&s;t have appeared in armour, and with banners, &s;urrounded with all the pride, pomp, and circum&s;tance of war. The appearance of their meeting was &s;urely very different. Their only armour was their tongues and their pens, and a few blotted and blurred &s;heets of paper the only banners which they di&s;played. It is not upon this act then that any proceeding again&s;t this convention can be founded. <HI>Unarmed</HI> con|vocations were not at this time prohibited by any law whatever, nor were they declared to be illegal until the acce&s;&s;ion of James VI. It was the wi&s;h of that monarch, as your lord&s;hips know, to aboli&s;h pre&s;bytery and to repre&s;s the powers of eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction ve&s;t|ed in the pre&s;byterian clergy. The di&s;putes which thus aro&s;e betwixt him and the clergy was the occa&s;ion of a &s;tatute upon this &s;ubject. By the act 1584, chap. 131, "It is &s;tatute and ordained be our &s;aid &s;overaine lord and his three e&s;taites that nane of his hienes &s;ubjects of quhat-&s;umever qualitie, a&s;taite or function they be of, &s;piritual or temporal, pre&s;ume or tak upon hand to convocate, conveene or a&s;|&s;emble them&s;elves togidder, for halding of councelles, conventions or a&s;&s;emblies, to treat, con&s;ult and terminat in ony matter of e&s;taite ci|vile or eccle&s;ia&s;tical (except in the ordinar judgment) without his maje&s;ties &s;pecial commandement or expre&s;&s;e licence, had and obteined to that effect, under the paines ordained be the lawes and actes of Parliament again&s;t &s;ik as unlawfully convocatis the kingis lieges."</P>
<P>After this an act was pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame reign, 1606, chap. 17 by which the act of 1584 was confirmed, with an addition that I &s;hall now read to your lord&s;hips. "That na per&s;on nor per&s;ons within burgh, what&s;omever rank, quality or condition they be of, pre&s;ume nor take upon hand from this forth, under what&s;omever cullour or pretext, to convocate or a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves together at any occa&s;ion, except they make due intimation of the lawful cau&s;es of their meet|ings to the prove&s;t and baillies of that burgh, and obtein their licence
<PB N="28" REF="027591_0028_0FD7BEFA6DB222A8">
thereto, and that na thing be done nor attempted by them in their &s;aids meetings, whilk may tend to the derogation or violation of the actes of parliament, lawes and con&s;titution made for the well and quyetne&s;s of the &s;aids burghs. Declaring by thir pre&s;ents, the &s;aids unlawful meetings and the per&s;ons pre&s;ent thereat to be factious and &s;editious, and all proceedings therein to be null and of nane availl. And the &s;aids per&s;ons to be puni&s;hed in their bodies, goods and geare, with all rigour, conforme to the lawes of this realme."</P>
<P>Your lord&s;hips &s;ee, that by this act, all per&s;ons are prohibited of any rank, quality, or condition, from convocating or a&s;&s;embling them|&s;elves together, upon <HI>any</HI> occa&s;ion, except they give due intimation to the provo&s;t and magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>My lords, it is no doubt true, that if the&s;e acts are &s;till in force, they apply directly to the Briti&s;h Convention; but if the&s;e acts are &s;till in force, they apply not merely to the Briti&s;h Convention, but to nine tenths of all the meetings that are held in Edinburgh. The&s;e &s;tatutes, if enforced, would be attended with effects at once the mo&s;t &s;erious and ludicrous. We might be conveyed from the rooms in George's Street, or George's Square, to the Tolbooth, from the Tolbooth to your lord&s;hip's bar, from your lord&s;hip's bar to the hulks at Woolwich, and, from the hulks, to Botany Bay, with a cate|&s;trophe very di&s;&s;imilar from the commencement.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e &s;tatutes Sir George Mackenzie &s;ays, "this crime of &s;imple convocation is ordinarily pur&s;ued before the Council, and is &s;eldom puni&s;hed, either by the Council or Ju&s;tice Court, <HI>tanquam crimen per &s;e</HI> but as the aggravating quality of a riot or other crime." My lords, this was the ca&s;e <HI>before</HI> the revolution; that it was never pro&s;ecuted but as the aggravating quality of another crime. <HI>Since</HI> the revolution, I believe there has been no trial whatever for this of|fence, I apprehend therefore that pro&s;ecutions upon the&s;e &s;tatutes are prohibited by a pa&s;&s;age in the claim of rights, which I &s;hall now read to your lord&s;hips. In the claim of rights is the following pa&s;&s;age: "That the cau&s;ing pur&s;ue and forfeit per&s;ons upon &s;tretches of old and ob&s;olete laws, upon frivolous and weak pretences, upon lame and defective probation, as particularly the late Earl of Arguyle, are contrary to law." My lords, if before the revolution the meeting in unarmed convocations was only puni&s;hed as an aggravating quality of another crime, and &s;ince has not been puni&s;hed at all, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily conclude that it falls within this enactment in the claim of rights, <HI>of ob&s;olete &s;tatutes.</HI> As an aggravating quality of a crime, it may operate to prevent the mitigation, or to increa&s;e the &s;everity of a puni&s;hment;&mdash;but though it may increa&s;e the <HI>degree</HI> of the crime, it cannot alter the <HI>nature</HI> of it; it cannot convert <HI>verbal</HI> &s;edition into <HI>real</HI> &s;edition.</P>
<P>But if any thing further is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew that no man can now be tried upon the&s;e old &s;tatutes, it will fully appear from two acts that I am now to mention. The act again&s;t conventicles, 1670, ch. 5. has the following preamble. "For&s;ameikle as the a&s;&s;embling
<PB N="29" REF="027591_0029_0FD7BEFBEDF6C110">
and convocating of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, without his maje&s;ty's warrand and authority, is a mo&s;t dangerous and unlawful practice, prohibited and di&s;charged by &s;everal laws and acts of Parliament, under high and great pains. And that notwith&s;tanding thereof divers di&s;affected and &s;editious per&s;ons, under the &s;pecious but fal&s;e pretences of religion, and religious exerci&s;es, pre&s;ume to make, and be pre&s;ent at, conventicles and unwarrantable meetings, and conven|tions of the &s;ubjects, which are the ordinary &s;eminaries of &s;eparation and rebellion, tending to the prejudice of the public wor&s;hip of God in the churches."</P>
<P>Your lord&s;hips will ob&s;erve, that in this preamble, it is po&s;itive|ly declared that conventicles fell within the&s;e old &s;tatutes made a|gain&s;t unarmed convocations, previous to <HI>this</HI> &s;tatute. Tho&s;e con|venticles were &s;ubject to puni&s;hment, as being unarmed convoca|tions of the people, and falling within the &s;tatute I <HI>formerly</HI> read to your lord&s;hip, enacted in the reign of James VI. In the reign of William and Mary, this act again&s;t religious conventicles, was expre&s;&s;ly repealed; but, I &s;ay the repeal of <HI>that</HI> act is of no avail, if <HI>the&s;e old &s;tatutes</HI> are &s;till in force. It is of no avail, becau&s;e men who &s;o meet in conventicles may be puni&s;hed under the old &s;tatutes pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of James VI. Unle&s;s therefore this &s;tatute, which was con&s;idered at the time as a great attainment to the liber|ties of the country, <HI>it</HI> is con&s;idered as nugatory, we mu&s;t under&s;tand that <HI>all</HI> the&s;e &s;tatutes again&s;t unarmed convocations are now ob&s;olete. In con&s;equence of the&s;e acts every clergyman, who is not a member of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of this country, might be puni&s;hed for hold|ing <HI>unarmed</HI> convocations. By the act pa&s;&s;ed under James VI. a|gain&s;t &s;uch convocations, the preacher might be carried from the pul|pit, and the audience from their &s;eats, to this bar, and puni&s;hed with DEATH! The act of William and Mary, therefore, is of no avail, if the&s;e old &s;tatutes again&s;t unarmed conventions are &s;till in exi&s;t|ence. Indeed, from the ab&s;urdity to which they would lead, it mu&s;t be demon&s;trable to your lord&s;hips that they can be no longer put in force.</P>
<P>Holding, therefore, that the &s;imple act of <HI>meeting in convention,</HI> as the&s;e per&s;ons are &s;aid to have done, in it&s;elf contains nothing cri|minal. The que&s;tion that next remains to be con&s;idered is, whether criminality is attached to them on account of the <HI>profe&s;&s;ed object</HI> which they had in view, the obtaining univer&s;al &s;uffrage, and annual parliaments, a reform in the repre&s;entation of the Commons Hou&s;e of Parliament.</P>
<P>My lords, this is a que&s;tion of politics on which I have no occa&s;ion to deliver my own opinion. All that I have now to enquire is, whe|ther the particular charges, preferred again&s;t the pannel in this in|dictment, amount to the generic crime of which he is accu&s;ed. The pannel is here &s;aid to have been guilty of &s;edition; becau&s;e he a&s;&s;o|ciated, with a number of others, in order to obtain univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual parliaments. This attempt may in one &s;en&s;e of the word
<PB N="30" REF="027591_0030_0FD54BE83746BDD8">
be termed illegal&mdash;ina&s;much as it certainly had for its object an altera|tion of the exi&s;ting laws of this country. But in this &s;en&s;e of the word, the propo&s;al of every new law may be equally termed illegal. It mu&s;t therefore be a different &s;pecies of illegality from this that the public pro&s;ecutor annexes to this convention, when he calls it an ille|gal and &s;editious meeting: and yet, my lords, if there is any new law or any alteration more than another upon our pre&s;ent laws, in the pro|priety of which a majority, and a great one too, of every de&s;cription of the people of this country has concurred, it is in this one thing&mdash;of a reform in the repre&s;entation of parliament.</P>
<P>Men of all ranks and de&s;criptions, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, from the mo&s;t learned, to the wor&s;t informed, have it one period or another declared their approbation of this mea&s;ure. As to the mode or degree in which it &s;hould be attempted, different opinions have been held by different men; and this difference as to the <HI>mode</HI> has hitherto pre|vented the <HI>object</HI> it&s;elf from being attained.</P>
<P>Upon this point, all the eminent men who at pre&s;ent &s;hine in the councils of our nation have declared their opinions, at one time or a|nother, and almo&s;t all of them have acknowledged the nece&s;&s;ity of a reform. Mr. Pitt, who enjoys, at pre&s;ent, the favour of the crown, and the confidence of parliament, has given his opinion, not merely in favour of reform, but decidedly in favour of that &s;pecies of reform which con&s;i&s;ts in introducing univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual parliaments. Mr. Fox has al&s;o declared him&s;elf a friend to reform, though not to the &s;ame length which Mr. Pitt has gone; and, on this account, the gentleman at the bar has &s;poken of this great &s;tate&s;man in terms of con&s;iderable di&s;approbation. In the cour&s;e of a long political life, which might be regarded as unfortunate, if the enjoyment of true glory were not to be preferred to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, Mr. Fox has all along declared him&s;elf an enemy to univer&s;al &s;uffrage, and if I am not mi&s;taken, to annual parliaments. Where &s;uch great men differ, it is not for us to decide; but &s;urely much blame cannot be im|puted to the man who&s;e opinions are &s;anctioned by either of &s;uch au|thorities. It would be hard, indeed, if this gentleman were to be pu|ni&s;hed, merely for having adopted the opinions of Mr. Pitt, in pre|ference to tho&s;e of Mr. Fox&mdash;that the &s;ame &s;entiments which have &s;erved to place one man at the head of the nation, &s;hould expo&s;e ano|ther to the vengeance of her laws&mdash;that they &s;hould rai&s;e the one per|&s;on to the height of preferment, to the pinnacle of his ambition, and plunge the other into the deepe&s;t aby&s;s of human wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>My lords, what I am going to read will &s;hew you, that the&s;e &s;en|timents have been held by men of the fir&s;t eminence, in point of rank, in point of (reputed, abilities) of fortune, and of power. The pam|phlet, from which I read, was publi&s;hed under the au&s;pices of a &s;oci|ety which owed its formation, in a great mea&s;ure, to the Duke of Richmond and Mr. Pitt; and of which they were long the leading members. The language does not di&s;grace its authors: "Every ap|plication, therefore, for the redre&s;s of the pre&s;ent grievances of the
<PB N="31" REF="027591_0031_0FD54C08627A4B40">
nation, that &s;hall be made to a body of men, no longer under the in|fluence of their con&s;tituents, but on the contrary, uniformly acting in &s;ub&s;erviency to the views and intere&s;ts of the crown, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;i|ty be un&s;ucce&s;sful; and from the natural effect of di&s;appointment up|on the human mind, will probably impair the vigour of every future exertion." In another pa&s;&s;age, "that the re&s;toration of the Com|mons Hou&s;e of Parliament to freedom and independency, by interpo|&s;ition of the great collective body of the nation, is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;a|ry to our exi&s;tence as a free people." I &s;hall only read one other pa&s;&s;age: "An Equal Repre&s;entation of the people in the great Coun|cil of the Nation, <HI>annual elections,</HI> and the <HI>univer&s;al right of &s;uffrage,</HI> appear &s;o rea&s;onable to the natural feelings of mankind, that no &s;o|phi&s;try can elude the force of the arguments which are urged in their favour; and they are rights of &s;o tran&s;cendent a nature, that in op|po&s;ition to the claim of the people to their enjoyment, the longe&s;t pe|riod of pro&s;cription is pleaded in vain. They were &s;ub&s;tantially en|joyed in the times of the immortal Alfred; they were cheri&s;hed by the wi&s;e&s;t princes of the Norman line; they form the grand palladi|um of our nation; they ought not to be e&s;teemed the grant of royal favor; nor were they at fir&s;t extorted by violence from the hand of power. They are the birth right of Engli&s;hmen, their be&s;t inherit|ance, which, without the complicated crimes of trea&s;on to their coun|try, and inju&s;tice to their po&s;terity, they cannot alienate or re&s;ign. They form that triple cord of &s;trength, which alone can be relied on, to hold, in times of tempe&s;t, the ve&s;&s;el of the &s;tate."</P>
<P>My lord, this charge, then, of having wi&s;hed for univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual parliaments, contains nothing criminal, nothing relevant to infer any puni&s;hment at all; and much le&s;s the puni&s;hment that has been inflicted on the crime of &s;edition. I am not now maintain|ing that a reform in parliament is expedient, and &s;till le&s;s that annu|al parliaments and univer&s;al &s;uffrage &s;hould be the mode of that re|form. That mode may be improper&mdash;&s;o Mr. Fox thinks it, in op|po&s;ition to what Mr. Pitt thinks, or at lea&s;t, mo&s;t certainly thought; and &s;o your Lord&s;hips, in oppo&s;ition to Mr. Pitt, may al&s;o think it. But, if the duration of parliaments has been different at different times, if the elective franchi&s;e has al&s;o been different at different times, and if our laws have oftentimes varied and altered both, and may in future vary and alter them again; then this is a &s;ubject upon which every inhabitant of the country is at liberty to form his own opinion, and take &s;uch mea&s;ures as he thinks proper for promoting tho&s;e changes of which he approves. In a matter of this kind, open to the delibe|ration of all, the only que&s;tion is, whether the mea&s;ures taken are le|gal. If illegal mea&s;ures are employed either to promote or oppo&s;e a reform, they are equally puni&s;hable in the one ca&s;e as in the other. My lords, it is here &s;tated, that it was criminal to propo&s;e this reform in the convention; and as actions, innocent in them&s;elves, may be made criminal by their relations and accompaniments&mdash;&s;o the public pro&s;ecutor maintains that this convention gives the tinge of criminali|ty
<PB N="32" REF="027591_0032_0FD54BE99A9BFB30">
to the propo&s;ed reform, in it&s;elf perfectly blamele&s;s. But your lord&s;hips will attend to where this argument leads. It has been &s;hewn, and I tru&s;t will &s;carcely be denied, that to meet in a conven|tion for innocent purpo&s;es is entirely innocent; on the other hand, it has been equally &s;hewn, that it is not criminal to wi&s;h for annual par|liaments, or univer&s;al &s;uffrage; but, &s;ays the public pro&s;ecutor, it is criminal to wi&s;h for univer&s;al &s;uffrage in a convention. This is &s;trange arguing&mdash;it is innocent to meet in a convention; it is innocent to wi&s;h for univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual parliaments; but it is criminal to meet in a convention, and <HI>there</HI> to wi&s;h for univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual parliaments. So that the&s;e two actions, perfectly innocent in them&s;elves, when joined together form a crime. It is a common &s;aying, that two blacks cannot make a white; but it &s;eems the con|ver&s;e holds good, that two whites may make a black. It appears that the&s;e men have wi&s;hed for univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual parlia|ments, and that they have wi&s;hed for it in a convention; but if it be lawful to meet in a convention, without expre&s;&s;ing &s;uch a with, and if the wi&s;h it&s;elf be innocent, it is totally impo&s;&s;ible that the&s;e two acts, in them&s;elves innocent, can form a crime. As in arithmetick, a thou&s;and cyphers will not make a &s;ingle unit, &s;o in morals, and in law, a thou&s;and innocent actions can never con&s;titute one crime. I ap|prehend, therefore, that I have &s;hewn that the great and general charge in this indictment, of having become a member of this a&s;&s;ocia|tion, for the purpo&s;e of obtaining univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual par|liaments, contains in it nothing illegal whatever.</P>
<P>It now remains to enquire, whether the re&s;olutions, &s;aid to have been adopted, and the &s;peeches, &s;aid to have been made by the gen|tleman at your lord&s;hips bar, contain in them&s;elves any thing crimi|nal; whether they &s;hew that he had any intention contrary to, or different from the profe&s;&s;ed objects of the convention, of which he was a member, that profe&s;&s;ed object being innocent.</P>
<P>The indictment goes on to &s;tate, that "in the whole form and manner of their procedure, as well as in the principles they avowed and propagated, clearly and unequivocally demon&s;trate, that their purpo&s;es were of the mo&s;t dangerous and de&s;tructive tendency, ho&s;tile to the peace and happine&s;s, and tending to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution of this realm; imitating, in the form and tenor of their proceedings, the Convention of France, the public and avowed enemies of this coun|try; and with whom Great Britain then was, and &s;till is, at war. The members calling each other, at their meetings, by the name of citizen, dividing them&s;elves into &s;ections, receiving reports from &s;aid &s;ections, &s;ome of which bear date, Liberty Court, Liberty Stairs, Li|berty Hall, fir&s;t year of the Briti&s;h Convention, one and indivi&s;ible; and &s;ome of which have <HI>Vive la Convention</HI> prefixed, and end with <HI>Ca ira;</HI> in&s;tituting primary &s;ocieties, provincial a&s;&s;emblies, and de|partments," and &s;o forth. My lord, as to the words Liberty Court, and Liberty Hall, they &s;urely contain nothing criminal. Liberty, both the word and the thing, has been long known, and I hope long
<PB N="33" REF="027591_0033_0FD7BEFD6DA43C10">
will be &s;o in this country; there is nothing French in it. As to the French phra&s;es, I admit that they are very fooli&s;h; I cannot conceive that a per&s;on of the abilities of this gentleman could have made u&s;e of them; and I believe it will be proved (if this cau&s;e goes to proof) that he had no concern in them. When the old de&s;poti&s;m &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in France, French phra&s;es were frequently u&s;ed; but nobody ever &s;uppo&s;ed that they who have adopted this fooli&s;h phra&s;eology had a|ny intention of introducing French de&s;poti&s;m into this country. Folly and guilt are very different things. The u&s;e of &s;uch phra&s;es may ex|po&s;e one to de&s;erve ridicule, but not to puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>But where would have been the crime, even if the re&s;olutions of this convention had been written in French altogether? However much we may abhor French principles, we are not now making war upon the French language; &s;uch conte&s;t would re&s;emble the wars of the Greeks and Trojans; not tho&s;e recorded by Homer, and which have immortali&s;ed the plains of Ilium; but tho&s;e battles of a later date, commemorated by our own countryman, the Spectator, and which were fought with le&s;s blood&s;hed in the gardens of Oxford. When it was fir&s;t attempted to introduce the &s;tudy of Greek into that univer&s;ity, the attempt, as your lord&s;hips know, was violently oppo&s;ed. <HI>Graecum e&s;t, non pote&s;t legi</HI> was then the &s;entence of con|demnation pronounced upon a book, and the &s;ignal of ho&s;tility again&s;t all who pre&s;umed to read it. The Trojans, however, were defeat|ed; the &s;tudy of Greek was introduced, and has flouri&s;hed at Oxford, and no SEDITION has followed it.</P>
<P>My lords, the indictment has been read, and therefore I will not go at length into it. Here is a long &s;peech, &s;aid to have been utter|ed by the gentleman at the bar, which contains a great deal of mat|ter, tending, no doubt, to make all the&s;e per&s;ons with for annual par|liaments and univer&s;al &s;uffrage. The conclu&s;ion of this &s;peech winds up the whole matter. "Let us then endeavour to in&s;truct the peo|ple in our rights, and to inform them of our views and our intentions; they will come and &s;ign our petitions, and we &s;hall be enabled to &s;end them up &s;ub&s;cribed by a majority of the people. The voice of the people will be heard wherever it is &s;poken in the language of truth, and by a number to re&s;pectable as to <HI>command</HI> attention; and it will &s;oon have that re&s;pectability, if we have rea&s;on on our &s;ide." I &s;ee that the word <HI>command</HI> is here put in italics, as if it implied or &s;ug|ge&s;ted the lea&s;t idea that violence or force was intended. The word mu&s;t be explained by its correlative, the &s;ub&s;tantive which it governs, attention. It cannot imply that he was to make u&s;e of <HI>force</HI> to gain attention, but to &s;eek for numbers, as convinced of the truth and utility of what he propo&s;ed; and if numbers and truth cannot pro|cure attention, what can? The tenor of this paragraph, as I have &s;aid, &s;ums up the import of his whole &s;peech, and &s;hews that no|thing like force was intended. It expre&s;sly &s;tates "let us then en|deavour to in&s;truct the people in their rights, and to inform them
<PB N="34" REF="027591_0034_0FD54BEB2BC7D320">
of <HI>our</HI> views and <HI>our</HI> intentions; they will come and &s;ign <HI>our</HI> PE|TITIONS." It is not in the form of <HI>petition</HI> that tho&s;e per&s;ons ap|pear who mean to u&s;e violence: it is impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, that a word u&s;ed figuratively can imply that violence was meant, or could po&s;&s;ibly be intended.</P>
<P>But if I am rightly informed, con&s;iderable &s;tre&s;s has been laid in former trials upon this re&s;olution, &s;aid to have been come to by the convention. The indictment &s;tates, that "the &s;aid a&s;&s;ociation, or meet|ing, did wickedly and feloniou&s;ly, then and there, all the members &s;tanding on their feet, &s;olemnly and unanimou&s;ly come to a re&s;olution of the following import or tenor, That this convention, con&s;idering the calamitous con&s;equences of any act of the legi&s;lature may tend to deprive the whole, or any part of the people, of their undoubted right to meet, either by them&s;elves, or by delegation, to di&s;cu&s;s any matter relative to their common intere&s;t, whether of a public or private nature, and holding the &s;ame to be totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the fir&s;t principles and &s;afety of &s;ociety, and al&s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of our known and acknowledged con&s;titutional liberties, do hereby declare, before God and the world, that we &s;hall follow the whole&s;ome example of former times by paying no regard to any act which &s;hall militate again&s;t the con&s;titution of our country; and &s;hall continue to a&s;&s;em|ble, and con&s;ider of the be&s;t means by which we can accompli&s;h a real repre&s;entation of the people, and annual election, until compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force." Now what is contained in this re&s;olution? It contains a declaration that they will not yield obedience to an act which has never yet even been <HI>propo&s;ed</HI> in our parliament; and which, I tru&s;t, the &s;ituation of this country will never be &s;uch as to render nece&s;&s;ary. What they &s;ay is this, they will not yield obedi|ence to an act if it &s;hould pa&s;s, not to an act of parliament in exi&s;t|ence, but an act which exi&s;ts in <HI>potentia</HI> only, which is no more law than the mo&s;t extravagant propo&s;ition that can be conceived. If this is criminal, it is a crime of a mo&s;t anomalous and extraordi|nary nature. They would not yield obedience to that which, per|haps, never might be a law; this, I &s;ay; is a crime of &s;uch an ano|malous and non-de&s;cript nature, that I know not under what term, or what degree of puni&s;hment it can fall. But at any rate, cer|tainly the crime of &s;aying that I will not yield obedience to an act, <HI>if it &s;hould pa&s;s,</HI> cannot be equivalent to di&s;obeying an act <HI>after it has pa&s;&s;ed.</HI> Now to what con&s;equences may this lead? I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e that an act had pa&s;&s;ed prohibiting conventions; that it had &s;aid that no convention was to a&s;&s;emble, to deliberate upon any public &s;ubject; and that any per&s;ons who might afterwards meet, &s;hould be liable to a fine of 20l. and impri&s;onment for a month. After this law a convention meets, in oppo&s;ition to the act, they are accordingly di&s;per&s;ed, and the per&s;ons guilty are puni&s;hed ac|cording to the penalty &s;tated in the act; but the&s;e men who have not di&s;obeyed any act, they having only re&s;olved to di&s;obey &s;uch an act if it &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed, are to be puni&s;hed with fourteen years tran&s;portation to Botany Bay! Such are the con&s;equences that
<PB N="35" REF="027591_0035_0FD54C0DA7495F80">
may follow; the members of this convention are to undergo a puni&s;hment beyond all ordinary bounds, for only having declar|ed their intention to di&s;obey an act, not in exi&s;tence; while tho&s;e, who in fact &s;hould di&s;obey it, might be liable only in a trifling pe|nalty.</P>
<P>My lords, I &s;ay again, that it is impo&s;&s;ible that any violence could have been here intended, becau&s;e if they were to di&s;obey <HI>this</HI> &s;uppo&s;|ed act, how were they to di&s;obey it? They mu&s;t have met in an <HI>unarmed</HI> and <HI>peaceable</HI> convention; for it is by <HI>&s;o meeting alone,</HI> that they could act in di&s;obedience of &s;uch a &s;tatute. If they had a&s;&s;em|bled, or if they or any other per&s;ons &s;hould be bold enough to a&s;&s;em|ble now, in an <HI>armed</HI> convention, they would not di&s;obey a &s;tatute &s;imilar to that pa&s;&s;ed in Ireland; they could only di&s;obey <HI>that</HI> by meet|ing in a peaceable, quiet, and orderly manner, to deliberate on pub|lic affairs. But if they had met violently and armed, it would have been in oppo&s;ition to &s;tatutes that have long exi&s;ted in this country; and of which the enactments are fully competent to repre&s;s all &s;uch il|legal violence.</P>
<P>My lords, this is taking the re&s;olution in its very <HI>wor&s;t</HI> &s;en&s;e; but take this, which may be con&s;idered as the preamble of the re&s;olutions, and let it be explained by the re&s;olutions which follow: the fir&s;t re&s;o|lution here is, "that the fir&s;t notice given for the introduction of a convention-bill, or any bill of a &s;imilar tendency to that pa&s;&s;ed in Ire|land, in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of their parliament, or any bill for the &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, or the act for preventing wrongous impri&s;onment, and again&s;t undue delays in trials in North Britain, or in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion, or the admi&s;&s;ion of any foreign troops what|ever into Great Britain or Ireland; all, or any one of the&s;e <HI>cala|mitous</HI> circum&s;tances &s;hall be a &s;ignal to the different delegates, to re|pair to &s;uch place as the &s;ecret committee of this convention &s;hall ap|point."</P>
<P>Now, your lord&s;hips will ob&s;erve, when, and on what ooca&s;ion they were to meet&mdash;they were to meet, not <HI>after</HI> the &s;tatute had pa&s;&s;ed, but <HI>when</HI> a bill was introduced for pa&s;&s;ing it&mdash;what could be the ob|ject of &s;uch meeting? It mu&s;t be to prevent it pa&s;&s;ing into a law, and to remon&s;trate, as they had a right to do, again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ing of it. They meant to petition parliament, &s;upported by &s;uch numbers, un|doubtedly, as they could procure, to prevent &s;uch a bill from becom|ing the law of the land. The object of their meeting, therefore, was to u&s;e their be&s;t endeavours, in a con&s;titutional manner, to pre|vent this bill from being pa&s;&s;ed into a law; and this re&s;olution clear|ly proves that they meant to meet when the bill was brought in, not for the purpo&s;e of di&s;obeying an act, but to prevent it, by all lawful means, from being made an act binding the &s;ubjects of this country to obedience. They were to meet upon the introduction of a con|vention-bill, or of a bill for the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, or of the act for preventing wrongous impri&s;onment; that is, they were to meet in order to remon&s;trate, in a con&s;titutional manner,
<PB N="36" REF="027591_0036_0FD7BED06EC8A770">
with parliament again&s;t the repeal of tho&s;e &s;alutary &s;tatutes which guard the rights and liberties of us all. Again, in ca&s;e of an inva&s;i|on, the folly of the re&s;olution is al&s;o &s;tated in the indictment as criminal, that "the fir&s;t <HI>&s;even</HI> members &s;hall have power to declare the &s;ittings permanent, and <HI>twenty-one</HI> &s;hall con&s;titute a convention, and proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s." In&s;tead of any thing criminal here, all is innocence. If twenty-one were to con&s;titute a convention, they could not &s;urely be an armed force to a&s;&s;i&s;t the invaders, they could with difficulty even have repelled them. There is al&s;o &s;tated in this indictment, a &s;econd &s;peech, &s;aid to be made by the gentleman at the bar, of which I &s;hall read the conclu&s;ion. It is printed in Italic, and therefore, I pre&s;ume the public pro&s;ecutor meant to lay particular &s;tre&s;s upon it. "If the &s;ervility of the people had been le&s;s, if they had dared to meet, and in place of murmuring, to have told their rulers that there was danger in &s;eeking to deprive them of their liberties, we would not have had to adopt this re&s;olution to-night, but when I &s;aw the calm deliberate countenances of all pre&s;ent, and the &s;olemn manner in which it was pa&s;&s;ed, I was con|vinced that it would not only be a re&s;olution of words but a rule of action." Now, what is a re&s;olution but a rule of action? My lord, <HI>every</HI> re&s;olution is, or ought to be, a rule of action, and is in|tended to be &s;uch when it is formed: this, therefore, is a very pro|per expre&s;&s;ion to enforce and explain more fully the deliberate na|ture of the re&s;olution entered into, to meet and endeavour to oppo&s;e &s;uch a bill from pa&s;&s;ing into a law, a bill to prevent peaceable and unarmed conventions from meeting in this country.</P>
<P>The indictment goes on to &s;tate, that the &s;aid meeting came to a re&s;olution, "That a &s;ecret committee of three and the &s;ecretary be appointed to determine the place where &s;uch convention of emer|gency &s;hall meet. That &s;uch place &s;hall remain a &s;ecret with them, and with the &s;ecretary of this convention, and that each delegate &s;hall, at the breaking up of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, be entru&s;ted with a &s;ealed letter, containing the name of the place of meeting. This let|ter &s;hall be delivered unopened to his con&s;tituents, the receipt of which &s;hall be acknowledged by a letter to the &s;ecretary, pre&s;erved in the &s;ame &s;tate, until the period &s;hall arrive at which it &s;hall be deemed nece&s;&s;ary for the delegate to &s;et out." Here is much &s;ecre|cy, but nothing el&s;e. And &s;ecrecy was nece&s;&s;ary if peaceable con|ventions were to be prohibited. But an armed force cannot meet in &s;ecrecy, unle&s;s we are to &s;uppo&s;e that the members of this con|vention were to a&s;&s;emble like the troops of Mr. Bayes in di&s;gui&s;e. The &s;ecrecy which they here ob&s;erve is the &s;ure&s;t proof of their in|nocence and peaceable intentions.</P>
<P>My lord, in going through the whole of this indictment, I can perceive nothing relevant in it to infer the crime of &s;edition, or any other crime. The meeting it&s;elf was innocent, the object they had in view was innocent, and the &s;peeches and re&s;olutions &s;aid to have been made are al&s;o innocent; in&s;omuch as they were merely
<PB N="37" REF="027591_0037_0FD7BED1F4423838">
calculated to promote the avowed object of the convention. They wi&s;hed for the &s;upport of numbers; but for what? To petition parliament. They were anxious that a bill &s;hould not be brought into parliament to prevent peaceable a&s;&s;emblies from meeting; and therefore they &s;ay they will prevent &s;uch bill, as far as they can, from pa&s;&s;ing into a law. This al&s;o was nece&s;&s;ary for the attain|ment of their object. All that can be &s;aid again&s;t them, therefore, amounts to this, that they took the be&s;t mea&s;ures they could for accompli&s;hing their purpo&s;e of obtaining a parliamentary reform; a purpo&s;e legal in it&s;elf, and which, on all hands, is admitted to be, in a certain degree, nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>At all events, I humbly apprehend, that the facts &s;tated in this indictment can only amount to verbal &s;edition&mdash;that there has been in this ca&s;e, no commotion, no ri&s;ing of the people, and that &s;peech|es uttered, or re&s;olutions formed, can only amount to verbal &s;edi|tion, or lea&s;ing-making.</P>
<P>In order to &s;hew this, I mu&s;t trouble your lord&s;hips with reading the definitions given of &s;edition by our law writers, comparing them with the charges &s;et forth in the indictment, and al&s;o with the &s;tatutes re&s;pecting verbal &s;edition.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is Sir George Mackenzie, book 1, title 7, who &s;ays, "Sedition is a commotion of the people, without authority; and if it be &s;uch as tends to the di&s;turbing of the government, <HI>ad ex|itium principis vel &s;enatorum ejus &amp; mutationem reipublicae,</HI> it is trea&s;on; but if it only be rai&s;ed upon any private account, it is not properly called trea&s;on, but it is, with us, called a convocation of the lieges."</P>
<P>Sedition, therefore, is a commotion of the people, or a ri&s;ing of the people, without authority, according to the definition given of it by this great lawyer.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar definition is given by Forbes, book 3, title 2, &s;ect. 1, "Sedition is a <HI>commotion</HI> or <HI>ri&s;ing</HI> of the people without authority, in order to do any thing tending to a di&s;turbance of the public peace, though the de&s;ign be not executed, which is rai&s;ed upon a public or private account."</P>
<P>According to Er&s;kine, the crime con&s;i&s;ts in rai&s;ing comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ns or di&s;turbances in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>I believe a definition more full and more accurate is given of this crime by Dr. Boyd, in his Ju&s;tice of Peace, in book 1, title 5, "Sedition is <HI>any commotion</HI> or <HI>ri&s;ing</HI> of the people, without lawful authority, and which tends to the di&s;turbance of the public peace of the kingdom."</P>
<P>My lord, every one of the&s;e definitions repre&s;ent &s;edition, not as con&s;i&s;ting in peaceable convocations, or in the &s;peeches and re|&s;olutions of &s;uch convocations, but as con&s;i&s;ting in commotions of ri&s;ings of the people.</P>
<P>Accordingly there is a mo&s;t material di&s;tinction to be made be|tween <HI>commotions and ri&s;ings</HI> and <HI>&s;peeches and re&s;olutions</HI> tending to
<PB N="38" REF="027591_0038_0FD54BEEDB250150">
excite commotions and ri&s;ings. The&s;e &s;peeches are <HI>termed</HI> &s;editi|ous, but the expre&s;&s;ion is figurative: they are &s;editious merely on account of their <HI>tendency</HI> to excite commotions and ri&s;ings of the people, which is really &s;edition; and this di&s;tinction is expre&s;&s;ly pointed out by &s;everal of our &s;tatutes.</P>
<P>A man who makes &s;peeches and re&s;olutions, the tendency of which is to excite commotions, is guilty of verbal &s;edition, but is not guilty of that crime which he has failed to commit; he is not guilty of tho&s;e commotions which his &s;editious &s;peeches tended in|effectually to produce. If a per&s;on excites another to murder, and the deed is not perpetrated, he is not an acce&s;&s;ary to the murder; he may be puni&s;hed undoubtedly by the laws of this country, but he is not guilty of that murder which he in&s;tigated, but which he in&s;tigated in vain. In the &s;ame manner, the&s;e people may be guil|ty of having endeavoured to excite di&s;turbances, but they cannot be puni&s;hed as guilty of tho&s;e commotions which have not exi&s;ted. This important di&s;tinction is fully recognized in &s;everal of our acts of parliament. In the acts 1555, chap. 60, in the reign of Queen Mary:</P>

<P>In con&s;equence of the union of the two crowns, in the reign of James VI. another act pa&s;&s;ed, to prevent national differences be|tween the Scotch and Engli&s;h, from being excited by &s;peeches and harangue, 1609, chap. 9.

<P>The&s;e are the &s;tatutes that point out, as I &s;aid before, and fully recognize the evident di&s;tinction that exi&s;ts between commotions and ri&s;ings of the people, and &s;peeches or writings, tending to ex|cite tho&s;e commotions. Your lord&s;hips will al&s;o ob&s;erve, that the crime &s;tated in the act 1606 con&s;i&s;ts in endeavouring to excite di&s;|turbances, by <HI>&s;ermons, declamations,</HI> or <HI>familiar conferences.</HI> Now, the declamations here mentioned, as di&s;tinct from &s;ermons, upon the one hand, or familiar conferences on the other, mu&s;t be preci&s;e|ly the &s;ame as the &s;peech &s;aid to have been made by this gentleman, or the re&s;olutions of the other members of the convention. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that per&s;ons would declaim in the fields where there were none to hear them. Their declamations mu&s;t have been addre&s;&s;ed to an a&s;&s;embly of the people, met together, like this con|vention, in a room; or which would have been &s;till more criminal, and of &s;till more dangerous tendency, they mu&s;t have been ad|dre&s;&s;ed to any accidental a&s;&s;emblage of people upon the public &s;treets.</P>
<P>But it is charged again&s;t this convention, that their object, though <HI>profe&s;&s;ed</HI> to be a reform in the repre&s;entation of the Com|mons Hou&s;e of Parliament, was <HI>really</HI> to overturn the government, and &s;ubvert the con&s;titution of this country; and, it has been &s;aid, that the <HI>tendency</HI> of the&s;e &s;peeches, joined to the <HI>intention</HI> with which they were uttered, converts this crime from verbal, into real &s;edition; that this circum&s;tance takes it out of the ca&s;e of lea&s;ing-making, where &s;peeches are uttered, not with the evil in|tention that is a&s;cribed to the&s;e per&s;ons, of &s;ubverting the con&s;titu|tion of the country, and changes it into real &s;edition, a crime of a different nature, and of a blacker dye.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="027591_0041_0FD7BF022E5DCBF8">My lords, if tho&s;e per&s;ons formed a plan, and entered into a re|&s;olution, of overturning this con&s;titution, and if that re&s;olution is indicated by their actions, they are not guilty of <HI>&s;edition,</HI> but of <HI>high trea&s;on;</HI> and for <HI>that</HI> crime let them be indicted. I &s;ay again, if they formed this intention to overturn the government of this country, and if this intention appears from their proceedings, they ought not to have been tried on an indictment &s;uch as this, but on a charge of high trea&s;on it&s;elf; a crime for which no puni&s;hment your lord&s;hips can here inflict is at all adequate. In the proceed|ings of the convention it&s;elf there is no proof of any &s;uch de&s;ign. If &s;uch an intention was proved from their proceedings, the crime would be trea&s;on. The con&s;equences are obvious. If the inten|tion is not proved, the public pro&s;ecutor is not intitled to <HI>pre&s;ume</HI> it, and arguing upon that pre&s;umption, to accu&s;e this gentleman of a greater crime than what ari&s;es from his &s;peeches, according to their plain and direct meaning. The intention of &s;ubverting the government is not here indicated in the way that the laws of trea|&s;on require; that is, there is no &s;ufficient proof of it, not even a ve&s;tige of evidence that could enable the public pro&s;ecutor to bring my client to trial for high trea&s;on. Did there exi&s;t any &s;uch proof, then the public pro&s;ecutor has neglected his duty, in not bringing an indictment for this crime. He cannot be permitted to &s;ay, that the proof of high trea&s;on being <HI>defective,</HI> he was obliged to charge for another offence, which very offence was to be aggravated by the trea&s;onable intention he could not prove: the <HI>want</HI> of proof of one crime is <HI>not</HI> the proof of another crime. This would be to overturn all judicial procedure, to &s;ubvert every notion of juri&s;|prudence. The members of this convention have formed that in|tention which is a&s;cribed to them, of overturning the government of this country, or they have not. Their having formed it, is proved, or it is not proved. If it is proved, they are guilty of high trea&s;on. If it is not proved, this criminal intention mu&s;t be laid out of con&s;ideration altogether, and cannot be permitted to aggra|vate the degree, much le&s;s to alter the nature of the offence charg|ed in the indictment. The deficiency of proof of one crime can never give ri&s;e to a new, or a different crime; if I am accu&s;ed of murder, and if evidence of the fact, that I committed the homicide is wanting, will that ever con&s;titute a charge of man&s;laughter? I &s;ay that the deficient proof of a greater crime can never con&s;titute a le&s;&s;er crime&mdash;let the le&s;&s;er crime be charged and puni&s;hed as &s;uch, or let the greater crime be charged and puni&s;hed as &s;uch. If it was the intention of the members of this convention to overturn the government of this country, they are guilty of trea&s;on.&mdash;If it was not their intention it ought not to be charged; and they are guilty of no crime at all.</P>
<P>Whether this gentleman at the bar has ever formed &s;uch inten|tion is known to his own brea&s;t. Whether he has ever formed
<PB N="42" REF="027591_0042_0FD54BF29C2B6918">
&s;uch intention is ever known to that Being, and to that Being alone, who can &s;earch the hearts of men, and without aid of external cir|cum&s;tances, pronounce upon the &s;ecret motives of their conduct. But no human judge can a&s;&s;ume this prerogative,&mdash;can pre&s;ume guilt from con&s;tructions put upon &s;peeches; con&s;tructions which may be different by different per&s;ons, and at different times; no man can lay his hand upon his heart, and upon con&s;tructions of this &s;ort &s;ay, that this gentleman has formed any &s;uch intention. Even, whatever may be his own opinion, he is not entitled to act, upon that opinion here; as no legal proof of any &s;ort has been brought, and no con&s;tructive proof of trea&s;on is known to our laws. I am &s;peaking here as if the &s;trange and illegal practices could be permitted, of bringing forward a higher crime, not to be puni&s;hed it&s;elf, but as the aggravation of an inferior offence. Even in &s;uch prepo&s;terous proceedings, could this practice be countenanced for a moment, there is, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, no evidence on which &s;uch aggravation could be placed.</P>
<P>My lords, the whole actions and proceedings of this convention may fairly, and with probability, and &s;o far as it &s;trikes my mind, can only be a&s;cribed to their wi&s;hes to attain the propo&s;ed object which they had in view, a reform in the Hou&s;e of Gommons, by the introduction of univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual parliaments. They <HI>may</HI> al&s;o have proceeded from the trea&s;onable intention a&s;cribed to them. But where the&s;e matters are doubtful, where the writ|ings and re&s;olutions of men may be a&s;cribed either to bad or good motives, humanity and ju&s;tice both require that they &s;hould be a&s;|cribed to motives that are good. When the&s;e re&s;olutions expre&s;s an avowed purpo&s;e, and when the&s;e men declare, in all their &s;peeches and motions, that they wi&s;hed not to &s;ubvert, but to reform the con&s;titution, will you &s;ay from tho&s;e very &s;peeches and re&s;olutions, that this was not their purpo&s;e? Are you, from &s;peeches contain|ing declarations that they wi&s;hed for reform, to conclude that they did not wi&s;h for reform? Are you from &s;peeches containing de|clarations that they wi&s;hed to &s;upport the con&s;titution, to conclude that they wi&s;hed to &s;ubvert it? This is &s;training con&s;tructive evi|dence to a great length indeed. Tho&s;e are que&s;tions upon which men, in their clo&s;ets, and in private life, may entertain different opinions; but your lord&s;hips know, much better than I do, what the &s;trictne&s;s of judicial evidence requires. We cannot receive in evidence tho&s;e things which in private life may convince us of the truth or probability of any fact. I &s;ay now, therefore, as I &s;aid before, that could the proof of &s;uch intention be adm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ted, as ag|gravating the le&s;&s;er offence charged, &s;till there is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roof of the aggravation.</P>
<P>My lord, it may be &s;tated that the circum&s;tances of the times in another country, may afford a proof of the intentions of the&s;e men. Upon this it does not become me to &s;peak in this place; but, with regard to the French Revolution, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that two views
<PB N="43" REF="027591_0043_0FD54C12F1EF8608">
may be taken of it in as far as it re&s;pects England&mdash;Tho&s;e &s;cenes of blood&s;hed that have been exhibited there, may &s;hew us the danger of innovation on the one hand; but the very &s;ame circum&s;tances may &s;hew us, on the other hand, the propriety of adopting a time|ly and moderate reform. A delay of reformation, may, as many think, have produced tho&s;e tran&s;actions which we all in common deplore. Some men may be impre&s;&s;ed with this event, &s;o as to &s;ti|fle all de&s;ire of reformation. To others, with equally virtuous views, it may appear that this very revolution is an additional ar|gument for obtaining a moderate and timely reform in the repre|&s;entation&mdash;Here again the ca&s;e comes to be the &s;ame as before. Who is entitled to &s;earch into this man's brea&s;t? He, perhaps, can lay his hand upon his bo&s;om and &s;ay, that he viewed the French Re|volution, as holding out to as a warning not to be too dilatory in obtaining a moderate reform, before the people are &s;tirred up to tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es which have been committed in France.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of the times then which are brought forward to aggravate the offences of the&s;e men, may in their own brea&s;ts form their ju&s;tification; becau&s;e they may con&s;ider the French Re|volution as evincing the nece&s;&s;ity and propriety of adopting a mo|derate and timely reform. Here then I apprehend that no &s;tre&s;s can be laid upon circum&s;tances which operate in two ways; which in one view, may operate to criminate this gentleman, and in ano|ther view, may be the very proofs of his innocence and virtue.</P>
<P>My lord, &s;etting a&s;ide this intention of overturning the con&s;titu|tion, no ve&s;tige of a crime remains. Even with this intention, &s;ince there has been no commotion, no ri&s;ing of the people, and &s;ince <HI>words</HI> &s;poken, whatever may be their purport, can never con&s;titute <HI>real</HI> &s;edition, &s;till the only offence is verbal &s;edition. This has not been a frequent crime; but it is a crime not altogether unknown to our laws. In the records of this Court there are <HI>two</HI> in&s;tances of trials for lea&s;ing-making or verbal &s;edition, upon a &s;tatute which I &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion to notice; the act 1703. The offences which were in tho&s;e ca&s;es charged again&s;t the pannels, I apprehend to have been at lea&s;t as criminal as tho&s;e which are laid to the charge of this gentleman.</P>
<P>On February 1&s;t, 1715, John Gratham and others were indict|ed for lea&s;ing-making and &s;landerous &s;peeches, tending to excite &s;e|dition, and alienate the affections of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects from his per&s;on and government, by &s;etting up the fal&s;e preten&s;ions of another. The <HI>corpus delicti</HI> was drinking the pretender's health at the Tron Church, by the name of James VIII. and his hap|py re&s;toration. This was a crime which was then thought to amount to lea&s;ing-making, and accordingly it was tried upon that &s;tatute.</P>
<P>Upon the 27th June, in the &s;ame year, John Oliphant, Alexan|der Wil&s;on, William Ram&s;ey, bailies of Dundee, William Lyon, of Ogle, trea&s;urer, and J. Wat&s;on, vintner, were indicted upon the
<PB N="44" REF="027591_0044_0FD7BED8AE692A20">
&s;ame &s;tatute, and the &s;ame offence of lea&s;ing-making, ina&s;much as for abetting the pretender's right, they did go upon the 10th of June, (the pretender's birth-day) to the cro&s;s of Dundee, and, in a &s;olemn manner, drank his health, by the title of King James, VIII. king of tho&s;e realms; and on the 20th, of June 1715, a thank&s;|giving appointed by parliament for the king's acce&s;&s;ion, when the bells were ringing, they went up and prevented their ringing, and cur&s;ed the king.</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave it to your lord&s;hip to decide, whether the crimes of which the&s;e men were convicted be not far more atrocious than the offences charged again&s;t this gentleman; and at a time too when re|bellion raged in this country:&mdash;at that very time they were thought to amount to lea&s;ing-making or verbal &s;edition only.</P>
<P>My lord, I now come to enquire as to the puni&s;hment to be in|flicted. Puni&s;hments upon the old acts are prohibited by a pa&s;&s;age in the Claim of Rights, which I formerly read, and &s;hall now read again to your lord&s;hips. Having particularly in their view this provi&s;ion in the Bill of Rights, the Legi&s;lature pa&s;&s;ed the act 1703 chap. 4. <HI>(Reads.)</HI> "Our &s;overaine ladie con&s;idering that by the acts of parliament following," reciting a number of acts, "the crimes therein mentioned are made capital, and puni&s;hable by death and confi&s;cation, and that the &s;aids laws have been liable to &s;treatches, and that in re&s;pect of their generality, and the various con&s;truction which the &s;ame may admit, they may be, as to the fore&s;aid capital puni&s;hment, of dangerous con&s;equence, <HI>Doth therefore,</HI> with advice and con&s;ent of the E&s;tates of Parliament, abrogate and di&s;charge, in all time coming, the fore&s;aid &s;anction and pain of death and con|fi&s;cation, contained in the &s;aid acts; and <HI>&s;tatutes and ordains,</HI> that the puni&s;hment of the crimes mentioned &s;hall, for hereafter, only be arbitrary, according to the demerit of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; that is, by &s;ining, impri&s;onment, or bani&s;hment; or if the party offender be poor, and not able to pay a fine, then to be puni&s;hed in his body (life and limb always pre&s;erved.")</P>
<P>My lord, one of the acts repealed by this &s;tatute is the act of 1584, chap. 134, where the offence was, as I formerly &s;tated, directly the &s;ame as that charged here, that is, declaiming in public again&s;t the go|vernment of the country. I need not again repeat that declamations cannot be uttered in a de&s;ert, where nobody can hear them, or in a private room, to a private company; they mu&s;t be addre&s;&s;ed either to &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly as this convention, or to the world at large, in the &s;treets, which would have been &s;till more dangerous; and there|fore, this act being one of tho&s;e repealed by the &s;tatute of 1703, the puni&s;hment of this la&s;t &s;tatute can only be inflicted upon the crime.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion comes then to be what is the puni&s;hment enact|ed by this &s;tatute, under the word bani&s;hment. With regard to <HI>tran&s;portation,</HI> your lord&s;hips know this was a puni&s;hment alto|gether unknown in this country till the reign of Charles II. It was
<PB N="45" REF="027591_0045_0FD54C1494A45CE0">
then introduced by the Privy Council, in imitation of what had been done in England, for the purpo&s;e of repre&s;&s;ing the religious &s;ecta|ries.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;ubject the authority of Sir George Mackenzie &s;eems to be deci&s;ive: "But with us no judge can confine a man whom ba|ni&s;heth to any place without his juri&s;diction; becau&s;e he hath no ju|ri&s;diction over other countries, and &s;o cannot make any acts, nor pro|nounce any &s;entences relative to them." Again, in another place he &s;ays, "As to the &s;ending away people to the plantations. It is an&s;wered, That none were &s;ent away but &s;uch as were taken at <HI>Bothwel Bridge,</HI> or in <HI>Argyle's Rebellion;</HI> and the turning capital puni&s;hment into exile, was an act of clemency, not of cruelry." If tran&s;portation had been a puni&s;hment at common law, I apprehend, Sir George Mackenzie mu&s;t have been too well acquainted with that law to think an apology for government nece&s;&s;ary. The apo|logy which he makes is, that the&s;e men had committed a capital offence, and therefore, &s;ays he, the turning capital puni&s;hment in|to exile, was an act of clemency and mercy, as otherwi&s;e they might have been puni&s;hed by death. I therefore apprehend, that the pu|ni&s;hment of tran&s;portation could only be inflicted in the ca&s;e, that Sir George Mackenzie &s;tates, or where it is expre&s;&s;ly pointed out by &s;ta|tutes, or in ca&s;es where the puni&s;hment is altogether di&s;cretionary, which it is not under the act 1703.</P>
<P>The Roman law has, as your lord&s;hips know, made a material di&s;|tinction between bani&s;hment and tran&s;portation. Under a law au|thorizing the puni&s;hment of <HI>regulatio</HI> merely, the more &s;evere pu|ni&s;hment of <HI>deportatio in in&s;ulam</HI> could not have been inflicted.</P>
<P>In judging of a matter of this kind, where a &s;tatute has expre&s;&s;ly declared, that the puni&s;hment of the&s;e offences is to be <HI>bani&s;hment,</HI> the fir&s;t thing to be done is to enquire into the common &s;ignification of the word 'bani&s;hment.' My lord, this is not a legal or a technical phra&s;e: the whole world are bound to under&s;tand it; and it ought not &s;o much to be referred to law-writers as to commnon-&s;en&s;e, and the etymology of the Engli&s;h language. It is a que&s;tion of philology, rather than of law; and holding it to be &s;uch, I refer to the autho|thority of Dr. John&s;on. He gives the following explanation: <HI>'To bani&s;h,</HI> to condemn to leave one's own country;' not a word of &s;end|ing to another country. The examples given are the words addre&s;&s;|ed by Macduff to Malcolm:
<Q><L>"O fare thee well!</L>
<L>Tho&s;e evils thou repeat'&s;t, upon thy&s;elf,</L>
<L>Have <HI>bani&s;hed</HI> me from Scotland."</L></Q>
Another &s;ignification of the word is 'to drive away:'
<Q><L>Bani&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s, bani&s;h &s;orrow,</L>
<L>To the gods belongs to-morrow.'</L></Q></P>
<P>If your lord&s;hips could bani&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s, and bani&s;h &s;orrow along with it to Botany Bay, we &s;hould all be much obliged to you.</P>
<P>My lord, with regard to the &s;tatute 1703, chap. 4, I apprehend,
<PB N="46" REF="027591_0046_0FD54BF6D17256D0">
that by the recital of the acts therein given, there is demon&s;trative evidence afforded of the meaning of the word bani&s;hment. The &s;ta|tute 1609, chap. 9, which is quoted and its penalty partly repealed by the act of Queen Anne, 1703, declares that the per&s;ons convicted under it '&s;hall be &s;everely puni&s;hed in their per&s;ons and goods, by impri&s;onment, <HI>bani&s;hment,</HI> fining, or more rigorous corporal pain.' At the time this &s;tatute was pa&s;&s;ed, in 1609, it cannot be maintained, and is not pretended, that tran&s;portation was known in this country, becau&s;e this country had then no juri&s;diction beyond it&s;elf. If bani&s;h|ment, therefore, in the act 1703, &s;ignifies tran&s;portation, it mu&s;t be made u&s;e of at once, in two different and contradictory &s;en&s;es. In the act: 609, bani&s;hment merely means, and can only mean, exile from Scotland. In the other acts recited in the repealing &s;tatute 1703, bani&s;hment, according to the public pro&s;ecutor, means tran&s;|portation, that is, impri&s;onment in &s;ome foreign country, attended with every thing that is ignominious and painful. The term <HI>bani&s;h|ment,</HI> thus, in the act 1703, means, by this con&s;truction <HI>both</HI> or <HI>either</HI> of the&s;e puni&s;hments, altogether different in them&s;elves, and of which we know certainly, that the <HI>one</HI> was <HI>not</HI> meant in one of the &s;tatutes repealed, and no evidence is brought that it <HI>was</HI> meant in any of the <HI>others.</HI> Such a con&s;truction is in&s;ufferable. The word bani&s;hment mu&s;t be under&s;tood in one &s;imple &s;en&s;e; and that is the &s;en&s;e in which it is employed in the act 1609.</P>
<P>Were it otherwi&s;e, the con&s;equences are as ab&s;urd as they are dreadful. If the word bani&s;hment cannot be employed in two &s;en&s;es in the accurate language of a repealing &s;tatute, and if its &s;imple &s;en&s;e be not <HI>exile from Scotland,</HI> but <HI>tran&s;portation,</HI> then the act, intend|ed, and bearing, to be a mitigation of puni&s;hment, would increa&s;e, and in an enormous degree, the &s;everity of puni&s;hment. The act 1609, repealed for its &s;everity, is rendered &s;till more &s;evere. Tran&s;|portation comes in place of bani&s;hment; and thus the Legi&s;lature, who in pa&s;&s;ing the &s;tatute of 1703, intended it as an act of mercy, have in reality committed an act of cruelty; in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening, they have increa&s;ed the &s;everity of the puni&s;hment which then exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>My lord, it has been &s;aid, that to &s;entence the&s;e men merely to ex|ile from Scotland, would be prepo&s;terous, as it would not be an ade|quate puni&s;hment, and becau&s;e it would leave them opportunities of committing the &s;ame offences in England. But if this is a prepo&s;te|rous penalty, I am &s;ure the &s;ame prepo&s;terous thing is committed twenty times every year by your lord&s;hips; for how often is it that you bani&s;h thieves and pickpockets forth of Scotland, leaving them at liberty to go to England, where, as people's pockets are <HI>generally</HI> better filled than they are here, per&s;ons of this de&s;cription will be enabled to exerci&s;e their profe&s;&s;ion with much greater advantage and &s;ucce&s;s? But, my lords, a puni&s;hment &s;o well known, in our own law, and in the laws of every country, as <HI>bani&s;hment,</HI> can never be called prepo&s;terous.</P>
<P>I &s;tated two trials in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century: John
<PB N="47" REF="027591_0047_0FD7BEDA3AD71088">
Graham was indicted for "lea&s;ing-making, and the utterance of &s;lan|derous &s;peeches, tending to excite &s;edition, and alienate the affections of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects from his per&s;on and government; &s;etting up the fal&s;e and &s;candalous preten&s;ions of another, by drinking the pre|tender's health, at the Tron Church, by the name of James VIII. and his happy re&s;toration." My lord, there were other per&s;ons con|cerned in this crime be&s;ides him; the verdict was, "the crime not proven again&s;t Graham and Hay, but found proven again&s;t Crawford, upon his own confe&s;&s;ion:" the &s;entence was, "that he be amerciat|ed in a fine of 50 l. &s;terling, and impri&s;oned till &s;ecurity found for payment."</P>
<P>My lords, in the other ca&s;e of "John Oliphant, Alexander Wil|&s;on, and William Ram&s;ay, bailies of Dundee, William Lyon, of Ogle, trea&s;urer, J.

<P>In the&s;e ca&s;es your lord&s;hips will ob&s;erve, that an enormous offence had been commmitted again&s;t the government; and you have heard th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">i&s;hment that was inflicted: whether it was, or was not equi|valent to the offence, I leave entirely to your impartial con&s;ideration. But my lord, certainly the circum&s;tances of the times then were at lea&s;t as dangerous as the pre&s;ent. Actual rebellion followed, and many unfortunate men fell in the conte&s;t. If any circum&s;tances could ju&s;tify the extreme &s;everity of a &s;entence they were tho&s;e which then exi&s;ted. But all that it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to do then was, to inflict the &s;mall puni&s;hment which your lord&s;hips have heard. I may al&s;o notice, that in the la&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;es, the pannels had been convicted of two offences, lea&s;ing-making, and a malver&s;ation in office as magi&s;trates. Being thus guilty of two crimes, the accumulated pu|ni&s;hments of fining, deprivation and impri&s;onment were inflicted up|on them.&mdash;</P>
<P>Having &s;aid &s;o much, I &s;hall now conclude. Before &s;itting down I mu&s;t yet mention one con&s;ideration per&s;onal to this unfortunate gentleman him&s;elf. His &s;tate of health is feeble, and in regard even to this there ought to be &s;ome mea&s;ure of the puni&s;hment. Should he reach his place of exile, his puni&s;hment will indeed be &s;evere. A man of high talents, of a cultivated under&s;tanding, is to be condemn|ed to the communion of thieves and villains, the refu&s;e and dregs of the human race! In &s;uch &s;ociety he is to be &s;ent to the de&s;olate &s;hores of the remote &s;outhern ocean. From tho&s;e haple&s;s regions it may, perhaps, be po&s;&s;ible to return; but from his &s;tate of health it is highly probable that this gentleman will never even arrive at his mi|&s;erable de&s;tination. His &s;entence of exile will have been to that 'un|di&s;covered country, from who&s;e bourn no traveller returns.'</P>
<P>I know that the <HI>humanity</HI> of your lord&s;hips will make you pau&s;e before you pronounce a judgment of which &s;uch mu&s;t be the con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Mr. Gillies, you have done ample ju&s;tice to your client, you have managed his defence in a very able manner.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Montgomery.</HI> My lord, after the very able and full di&s;cu&s;&s;i|on which this que&s;tion underwent a fortnight ago, not only by your lord&s;hips, but by the coun&s;el on both &s;ides, I &s;hould con&s;ider my&s;elf much to blame, were I to con&s;ume a great deal of your lord&s;hip's time, by entering at large again into the field of argument then &s;ta|ted, becau&s;e I feel my&s;elf incapable of giving any additional illu&s;tra|tion or adding weight to the argument then &s;o ably &s;tated by the Solicitor General.</P>
<P>My lords, the coun&s;el for the pannel has endeavoured to maintain before your lord&s;hips a variety of propo&s;itions, all of which it is in|cumbent
<PB N="49" REF="027591_0049_0FD7BF03A53B3448">
upon him to make out before his client can derive any bene|fit from them. The fir&s;t was, that this libel was too general, that it includes verbal &s;edition, and that therefore &s;uch a general indictment ought not to be found relevant to the knowledge of an a&s;&s;ize. It is very true, both verbal and real &s;edition are known to the laws of this country; but it is not from the major propo&s;ition alone that he is to learn which is meant to be charged; but he is to look to the minor propo&s;ition, and if there is &s;uch a thing exi&s;ting in the law of this country as real &s;edition he will there find it.</P>
<P>His next propo&s;ition is, that if this indictment is not on account of its generality to be laid a&s;ide entirely, it mu&s;t be pre&s;umed that &s;imple &s;edition, or lea&s;ing-making, only is the crime laid, and that your lord&s;hip in the interlocutor would &s;o find it; and he in&s;tanced the ca&s;e by an example which I &s;hould have taken to prove the contrary; for it is very well known, that, for the crime of theft, either a capi|tal or an arbitrary puni&s;hment may be inflicted. The u&s;ual mode of laying indictments is the &s;ame, that the crime is of a heinous nature, and &s;everely puni&s;hable; and from the minor propo&s;ition you are to learn whether it is &s;uch a crime as will infer an arbitrary or a capital puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>My lords, he has &s;tated three different propo&s;itions: In the fir&s;t place, that there is nothing criminal &s;et forth in the indictment, and that therefore it ought to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed entirely, becau&s;e it contains nothing upon which puni&s;hment can be inflicted. In the &s;econd place, that if there is any thing criminal, it can only amount to lea&s;ing-ma|king, which infers a &s;maller puni&s;hment, and not to real &s;edition, which infers a greater puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>And the object of both the&s;e propo&s;itions was to make way for the la&s;t and main object, namely, to &s;hew that under the term bani&s;hment in the act 1703, exile from Scotland, only, and not tran&s;portation was intended.</P>
<P>My lord, with regard to the fir&s;t that there is noting criminal charged in the libel, I &s;hould think it an indignity offered to your lord&s;hips and to the jurors who tried the former ca&s;es, and found tho&s;e per&s;ons guilty, to take up much time in proving that it contains matter highly criminal and de&s;erving of very great puni&s;hment. Mr. Gilles a&s;ked if there was any thing wicked, if there was any thing &s;editious, or if there was any thing criminal in u&s;ing the words <HI>&ccedil;a ira,</HI> or in u&s;ing French terms in this convention, unle&s;s the object of their meeting was criminal.</P>
<P>My lord, in order to judge of the criminality of this libel, I appre|hend we &s;hould lay the whole of the facts together, and I will ap|peal to the under&s;tanding of every man, whether he can figure to him&s;elf a more flagitious crime than that charged again&s;t the pannel, namely, joining a con&s;piracy again&s;t the government of this country, which they have endeavoured to promote to the utmo&s;t of their pow|er u&s;ing French terms <HI>vive la convention, &ccedil;a ira,</HI> Liberty Hall, Li|berty
<PB N="50" REF="027591_0050_0FD54C18F48BEF50">
Stairs, and &s;o on, as general circum&s;tances, go to prove that the pannel at the bar, with other per&s;ons, have met for the dete&s;table purpo&s;e of overturning the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>My lord, my brother has endeavoured to take off the effect of this mo&s;t extraordinary declaration, which tho&s;e gentlemen not &s;atis|fied with &s;imply re&s;olving, but thought nece&s;&s;ary to bind them&s;elves to the performance of by an oath. He &s;ays, in arguing the relevan|cy, they made this re&s;olution, no doubt but the act, the pa&s;&s;ing of which they meant to oppo&s;e, has not yet taken place, and therefore it is no crime; that is not the fact here &s;tated. The charge here &s;tated, is an attempt to intimidate the government of this country, that if a law pa&s;&s;ed, which they fore&s;aw mu&s;t pa&s;s, if their operations were not put an end to, they were declaring and binding them&s;elves, that if &s;uch an act pa&s;&s;ed, they would &s;till continue to meet to intro|duce annual parliaments and univer&s;al &s;uffrage, till &s;uch time as they were compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force. The gentlemen &s;ay, that their object was merely to bring it about by peaceable means.&mdash;Is it by peaceable means that they intend to do it, when they tell you that nothing will prevent them but &s;uperior force. Is that peaceable means? Is that the language of a man who means to remon&s;trate? No; it is held out as a threat again&s;t the government of the coun|try, daring them to do an act which they know mu&s;t cru&s;h their pro|ceedings.</P>
<P>My lords, my brother has gone on to &s;ub&s;equent re&s;olutions, and one in&s;tance he gives, that they had only peaceable objects in view; that they were not to meet after the act was pa&s;&s;ed, but that they were to act immediately upon the fir&s;t notice given of a convention-bill; that their object was to procure a number of &s;ub&s;criptions, in order that they might go up to parliament with &s;uch force as to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;carriage. That is his argument, and in|genious it may be, were it not contradicted by circum&s;tances. From the indictment your lord&s;hip &s;ees, that the members of this conven|tion are to be entru&s;ted with a &s;ealed letter, to be given to their con|&s;tituents, containing the name of the place in which they are to meet in &s;ecret, which them&s;elves are not to know, much le&s;s the va&s;t num|ber of per&s;ons who&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions they are to get; and that is the mode which is to have the effect of preventing, or rather of re&s;i&s;ting the execution of this act.</P>
<P>My lord, it is further &s;aid, that they had another object in view, the re&s;i&s;tance of an inva&s;ion; and that this letter mu&s;t be under&s;tood to have applied to a meeting of the convention for that purpo&s;e. A very likely &s;tory, that a meeting of &s;even, being all that was required to declare their meeting permanent, or at mo&s;t twenty-one, that &s;uch a meeting was to re&s;i&s;t, far le&s;s repel an inva&s;ion made upon this country. My lord, I apprehend nothing farther need be &s;aid with regard to the criminality of the charge as &s;tated in this indictment. My lord, the gentleman him&s;elf has given &s;ufficient evidence, that they were not to meet for the purpo&s;e of petitioning parliament,
<PB N="51" REF="027591_0051_0FD54C43A0D1EAA0">
which is legal and con&s;titutional, and there are meetings for that purpo&s;e which are attended by people of the greate&s;t re&s;pectability. But this &s;eems not to be their object; for the gentleman him&s;elf &s;ays, that this mea&s;ure of theirs may be thought by &s;ome a bold, by others a daring mea&s;ure. Did the gentleman mean, when he &s;aid this, that the people were to believe that the object they had in view was merely to petition parliament? No; and he could not have de&s;cri|bed it in more emphatical language, which, I am &s;ure, every per&s;on who hears it will feel highly applicable to the proceedings of the Bri|ti&s;h Convention.</P>
<P>My lord, with regard to the next propo&s;ition, namely, that this is lea&s;ing-making only, and that the act 1703 &s;hould have been &s;pe|cially libelled on. My an&s;wer is very &s;hort, that it is not lea&s;ing-making, but real &s;edition; a crime well known to our laws long before the exi&s;tence of any &s;tatute. Every lawyer who has treated upon the &s;ubject, has not only made a di&s;tinction between lea&s;ing-making and real &s;edition, but between real &s;edition and high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>My lord, much, no doubt, may be &s;aid with regard to the defi|nition of real &s;edition; for, from the great variety of &s;hapes which this crime may a&s;&s;ume, and the various degrees of guilt which the actors incur who commit the&s;e crimes, it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to give any ju&s;t definition of the crime, &s;o as to comprehend every po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e; but there are to be found treati&s;es in the criminal law which point out a clear di&s;tinction, and &s;hew that the charge here laid comes within the crime of real &s;edition.</P>
<P>My lord, I will beg leave to read the definition of Er&s;kine&mdash; the fir&s;t I &s;hall read is in his &s;mall compend. He &s;ays, <Q>It con|&s;i&s;ts in rai&s;ing commotions, or di&s;turbances in the &s;tate; it is ei|ther verbal or real. Verbal &s;edition, or lea&s;ing-making, is infer|red from the utterring of words tending to create di&s;cord between the king and his people. It was formerly puni&s;hed by death and the forfeiture of goods, but now, either by impri&s;onment, fine, or bani&s;hment, at the di&s;cretion of the judge. Real &s;edition is generally committed by convocating any con&s;iderable number of people, without lawful authority, under the pretence of re|dre&s;&s;ing &s;ome public grievance, to the di&s;turbing of the public peace.</Q></P>
<P>My lord, in his larger work, he &s;ays, <Q>The crime of &s;edition con&s;i&s;ts in rai&s;ing commotions and di&s;turbances in the &s;tate. It is either real or verbal. Real &s;edition is inferred from an irre|gular convocation of a number of people, without lawful autho|rity, tending to ob&s;truct or trouble the peace of the community. Such commotions as are aimed directly again&s;t the &s;overeign or &s;tate amount to high trea&s;on; but where they are rai&s;ed merely to redre&s;s &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed grievance, it is the crime which falls properly under the term Sedition.</Q> In like manner a &s;mall book
<PB N="52" REF="027591_0052_0FD54C1A92F76090">
noticed formerly by one of your lord&s;hips, Bayne &s;ays, <Q>Sedition is an irregular commotion of the people, or convocation of a number of citizens, a&s;&s;embled without lawful authority, tending to di&s;turb the peace and order of &s;ociety.</Q> Is not this the very crime here &s;tated? I apprehend, what has led my brother into an error has been the confounding of the different &s;en&s;es of the term commotion. Commotion, in an enlarged &s;en&s;e, may no doubt &s;ig|nify a ri&s;ing in arms again&s;t the government of the country; but, in another &s;en&s;e, it may &s;ignify an illegal convocation of people, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ut lawful authority, tending to di&s;turb the peace and order of &s;ociety. I &s;ay, if it was otherwi&s;e, there could be no &s;uch thing as real &s;edition; becau&s;e, the moment, according to them, that it becomes real &s;edition, it cea&s;es to be &s;edition, it is high trea&s;on, not only by the trea&s;on laws as they now &s;tand, but is clearly high trea&s;on in the old trea&s;on laws. Therefore, I apprehend, the di|&s;tinction between real &s;edition, and verbal &s;edition, is perfectly ob|vious. It is not nece&s;&s;ary, in order to con&s;titute real &s;edition, that there &s;hould be a ri&s;ing in arms; for the moment there is a ri&s;ing in arms, it cea&s;es to be &s;edition. Lea&s;ing-making, on the other hand, implies this, and no more, the uttering or &s;peaking, either in convocations or &s;preading by means of libels or hand-bills, any wicked, fal&s;e, &s;candalous &s;peeches, which tend to introduce jealou|&s;ies among the people, and to overturn the &s;tate. But &s;edition may exi&s;t without uttering any &s;candalous and fal&s;e &s;peeches; as, for in&s;tance, when this gentleman declared and bound him&s;elf by an oath, to re&s;i&s;t any act that might pa&s;s to prevent the meeting of this convention&mdash;this was not a fal&s;e &s;peech; it contained, in a melancholy truth, that the&s;e people &s;et them&s;elves up in defiance of the law of the country, and declared they would not de&s;i&s;t from their wicked proceedings till they were compelled by &s;uperior force.</P>
<P>My lord, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to look to our &s;tatute book, for the exact definition of &s;edition, or when it was fir&s;t introduced into the law of Scotland; for it has been well ob&s;erved, by all of your lord&s;hips, that it mu&s;t have exi&s;ted, not only in this, but in every country; that it is coeval with the exi&s;tence of &s;ociety it&s;elf, be|cau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible that any country can exi&s;t, if the crime of &s;e|dition be allowed to pa&s;s without any puni&s;hment at all. In the law of Scotland, it exi&s;ted for many generations, before it became the object of &s;tatute law, till the puni&s;hment applicable by the common law was not &s;ufficient to refrain the vices and wickedne&s;s of the people; and then acts were made only regarding the&s;e par|ticular &s;pecies of &s;edition which appeared to be mo&s;t criminal, and which appeared to be mo&s;t levelled again&s;t the government of the country. At that time it never occurred to the ju&s;tice of the le|gi&s;lature, and it would have been unju&s;t if it had, to have framed an act &s;o comprehen&s;ive as to include every &s;pecies of crime which could fall under the term of &s;edition, becau&s;e they mu&s;t have
<PB N="53" REF="027591_0053_0FD7BEBAEB573318">
known that it is a crime, not only infinite in its variety, but al&s;o infinite in its degrees and &s;hades of guilt. Particular acts of &s;edi|tion were declared to be capital, and with re&s;pect to &s;ome of them, I mu&s;t call your lord&s;hips attention, for they contain a particular &s;pecification of the crime here charged; and had this gentleman been tried, prior to 1709, when the old trea&s;on laws exi&s;ted in this country, he mu&s;t have been tried for high trea&s;on, and puni&s;hed with death.</P>
<P>My lord, the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;tatutes was &s;tated by the Solicitor General, when he fir&s;t argued the ca&s;e to your lord&s;hips, 1584&punc; chap. 130, <Q>Therefoir it is &s;tatute and ordained, be our &s;aid &s;overaine lord, and his &s;aidis three e&s;taites in this pre&s;ent parliament, that nane of his lieges and &s;ubjectes pre&s;ume or tak upon hand to im|pugne the dignitie and the authorite of the &s;aidis three e&s;taites, or to &s;eek or procure the innovation or diminution of the power and authoritie of the &s;ame three e&s;taites, or any of them, in time cumming, under the paine of trea&s;on.</Q> Does not this gentleman, I would a&s;k, impugn the dignity of the e&s;tates of parliament, when he &s;ays, that they would pay no regard to the wi&s;dom of parlia|ment, and that they would continue to meet till &s;uch time as they were compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force; and he does not con|tent him&s;elf with that, but ju&s;tifies their doing &s;o upon the laws of God, and right rea&s;on: he &s;ays, <Q>if &s;uch a law were &s;uffered to pa&s;s, if men were not allowed to utter their complaints, a number of fierce and rancorous pa&s;&s;ions would ari&s;e, and we would &s;eek to appeal to that la&s;t terrible deci&s;ion, the event of which is un|certain, but which God and nature allows.</Q> Here the gentleman is not only &s;aying, but binding him&s;elf by an oath, that if the le|gi&s;lature &s;hould enact a particular &s;tatute, they would re&s;i&s;t it, by continuing to meet, till they were compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force. Here they are telling the whole country, that their re&s;i&s;|tance is &s;anctioned by the laws of God, and the laws of rea&s;on. I apprehend it to be clear therefore, that if he had been tried prior to that act, he mu&s;t have been tried and puni&s;hed for high trea&s;on, according to the &s;tatute I have now read, which inflicts the puni&s;h|ment of death. But, my lord, there is another act applicable to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, it is the act 1662, chap. 2, <Q>An act for the pre|&s;ervation of his maje&s;ty's per&s;on, authority, and government. And &s;ince the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the late troubles, did in a great mea&s;ure, proceed from &s;ome trea&s;onable and &s;editious po&s;itions infu&s;ed into the people, <HI>that it was lawful to &s;ubjects for reforma|tion to enter into covenants and leagues, or to take up arms again&s;t the king, or tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioned by him, and &s;uch like;</HI></Q> and &s;o on till it comes to the following enactments. <Q>Like, as his ma|je&s;ty and e&s;tates of parliament, reflecting on the &s;aid con&s;equences of the&s;e rebellious cour&s;es, and being careful to prevent the like for the future, have therefore &s;tatute and ordained, and by the&s;e &s;tatutes and ordains, that if any per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;hall, hereafter
<PB N="54" REF="027591_0054_0FD7BEDD2E0236A8">
plot, contrive, or intend death, or de&s;truction, to the king's ma|je&s;ty, or any bodily harm tending to death or de&s;truction, or any re&s;traint upon his royal per&s;on, or to deprive, depo&s;e, or &s;u&s;pend him from the &s;tile, honour, and kingly name, of the imperial crown of this realm, or any others his maje&s;ty's dominions, or to &s;u&s;pend him from the exerci&s;e of his royal government, or to le|vy war, or take up arms, again&s;t his maje&s;ty, or any commi&s;&s;ion|ed by him, or &s;hall entice any &s;trangers or others to invade any of his maje&s;ty's dominions, and &s;hall, by writing, printing, preach|ing, or other malicious and devi&s;ed &s;peaking, expre&s;s or declare &s;uch their trea&s;onable intentions, that then the&s;e per&s;ons are to &s;uffer death, as in ca&s;es of trea&s;on.</Q> Have not the gentlemen expre&s;&s;ed, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, and bound them&s;elves by oath, that they would re&s;i&s;t the government, and that they would re&s;i&s;t it by force? And they ju&s;tify force by the laws of God and rea&s;on. Is not this then an intention of levying war again&s;t the king? Therefore, if the gentleman had been tried upon this &s;tatute, prior to the &s;tatute of 1709, he might have been puni&s;hed as a traitor; becau&s;e he has declared his intention to be to make war again&s;t the government, till &s;uperior force compelled them to de&s;i&s;t. If the gentleman had been tried, even after the pa&s;&s;ing of the act 1703, and before 1709, he mu&s;t have been tried and puni&s;hed as a traitor. And, my lord, what effect is the introduction of the trea&s;on laws into this country to have? Are the&s;e acts of &s;edition, of &s;uch an ag|gravated nature, as are declared trea&s;on by law, not to be liable to any puni&s;hment whatever? For, my lord, admitting that there is no &s;uch thing as real &s;edition, then I &s;ay the act 1703, give it the wide&s;t range po&s;&s;ible, never can reach tho&s;e acts of &s;edition, which were declared trea&s;on by former acts. But, my lord, the natural con&s;equence of the operation of the trea&s;on laws of England, com|ing into this country, is not to have the effect of leaving the&s;e crimes without puni&s;hment at all, but leaves them exactly in the &s;ame &s;itua|tion in which they were before this act of parliament was introduc|ed; and your lord&s;hip is intitled to puni&s;h, at common law, as your lord&s;hip would have done if the ca&s;e had been tried prior to the pa&s;|&s;ing of the&s;e acts.</P>
<P>My lord, if I am right in this po&s;ition, that this crime is real &s;edi|tion, and that falling under tho&s;e acts, it might have been puni&s;hed as trea&s;on, it is matter of very little con&s;equence what is meant by the word bani&s;hment; becau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the fir&s;t place I apprehend this ca&s;e is not lea&s;ing-making, as I have endeavoured to &s;hew your lord&s;hip; but &s;uppo&s;e the ca&s;e were lea&s;ing-making, I am not bound, in this ca&s;e, to lay the libel upon the lea&s;ing-making &s;tatutes; for, although it was well ob&s;erved by your lord&s;hips that where an act creates a crime, and &s;pecifies the puni&s;hment to be annexed upon the convic|tion of &s;uch a crime, we mu&s;t apply the &s;tatutory puni&s;hment. But, my lord, it often happens, that acts of parliament are introduced where the crime exi&s;ted at common law before; and, in the&s;e ca&s;es,
<PB N="55" REF="027591_0055_0FD54C469EBECDC8">
whether the acts introduced a le&s;&s;er or higher pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hment, unle&s;s the act &s;pecially takes away the crime at common law, &s;pecially deprives you of the juri&s;diction inherent in this court, of trying at common law, there is no occa&s;ion for that &s;tatute. Your lord&s;hips know when the crime is made greater, I may charge it either upon the &s;tatute or the common law; and it often happens that the object of the &s;tatute is to give juri&s;diction to a court that it had not before, or to introduce a more &s;ummary mode of puni&s;hment; and, in that ca&s;e, unle&s;s the act declares that you are not to try at common law, it is not to be pre&s;umed that the common law power is taken away. For, in the ca&s;e of bribing the exci&s;e officers, though it is puni&s;hable at common law, there are &s;tatutes impo&s;ing &s;evere fines; and your lord&s;hip will recollect, in the ca&s;e of Mr. Stein, for bribing Mr. Bonar, it was &s;trongly urged that, as the act introduces the puni&s;hment of &s;evere fine, you are not entitled to di&s;regard this act and go to a trial at common law, but you mu&s;t lay the libel upon this &s;tatute, and con|fine your&s;elf to the puni&s;hment inflicted by that &s;tatute; but your lord&s;hips common law powers are not taken away, and therefore you are entitled to try and puni&s;h that gentleman at common law.</P>
<P>My lord, I may exemplify this ca&s;e by an in&s;tance which has been introduced by my brother; in pleading this ca&s;e, he mentioned the ca&s;e of &s;everal people tried upon the lea&s;ing-making &s;tatutes. Tho&s;e per&s;ons were not tried upon the lea&s;ing-making &s;tatutes alone, for they were tried upon the laws of God, and upon the laws of this and every other well governed realm. I will al&s;o refer the gentleman to another ca&s;e, in 1712, when the party tried, and the able coun&s;el who defended him, knew perfectly well the meaning of the word ba|ni&s;hment. His indictment is laid upon the act 1703, and is al&s;o laid upon the laws of God, and of this and every other well governed realm. The coun&s;el for that gentleman pleaded a variety of objec|tions to the relevancy of that indictment, but it never occurred to the gentleman to &s;tate, that it was not competent for the court to try him both upon the common law of this land, and upon the &s;tatute law. My lord, it never occurred to him that the puni&s;hment was different by the common law; they never a&s;ked your lord&s;hips to di&s;mi&s;s the indictment, becau&s;e it was laid upon both laws, nor did they argue that your lord&s;hips ought to define and declare to the jury, that the term bani&s;hment, in this act, was exile and not tran&s;port<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ion:&mdash;No &s;uch thing, and it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that it was through ignorance, for they were men learned in the law, and living at the very time the acts were made.</P>
<P>My lord, this, in my mind, affords a &s;trong argument, not only to &s;hew that an indictment is relevant at common law, although an act of parliament has been introduced, making it a crime, and &s;tating a particular puni&s;hment, unle&s;s that act de&s;troys your lord&s;hip's power at common law: it goes to &s;hew that under the word bani&s;hment, tran&s;portation is likewi&s;e included, or the gentlemen would certainly have in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;o material a thing for the &s;afety of their client.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="027591_0056_0FD54C1D5FA24828">My lord, this leads me to take notice of the la&s;t propo&s;ition, which is the main object of the whole argument in this ca&s;e, namely, that exile, or bani&s;hment from Scotland, only ought to be the puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>My lord, I will not follow the gentleman into dictionaries to look for the term; and the one that he has found does not &s;eem to afford him any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But, if I can &s;hew that tran&s;portation was con&s;i|dered as included in the term by the lawyers of the times, and by hi|&s;torians of the times, there is an end of this que&s;tion; for, independ|ent of the various &s;entences which were read to your lord&s;hips upon the la&s;t occa&s;ion, and which I &s;hall not con&s;ume your lord&s;hips time by reading again, from the books of adjournal of this court, not only prior to the pa&s;&s;ing of the act 1703, but down to 1756, when the puni&s;hment of tran&s;portation was introduced, I &s;hall refer your lord|&s;hip to the &s;entences of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, which &s;hew that they under&s;tood bani&s;hment in the very &s;ame &s;en&s;e; and prior to 1756 there are a variety of ca&s;es which &s;hew, that from the incidental ju|ri&s;diction they had in the puni&s;hment of forgery, they are entitled at common law, without the aid of any &s;tatute, to &s;end people to the plan|tations; and the uniform form of the &s;entence is in the&s;e words, 'or|dain that he be carried back to pri&s;on, there to remain till an oppor|tunity offers of carrying him to &s;ome of the plantations in America, there to be bani&s;hed for ever.' In &s;ome ca&s;es, it is bani&s;hed for ever, in other ca&s;es, for a certain number of years.</P>
<P>My lord, I might al&s;o re&s;ort to the hi&s;torians of the times&mdash;I will read to your lord&s;hip one pa&s;&s;age from Guthrie's Hi&s;tory, which clearly &s;hews that he under&s;tood tran&s;portation to be included in the word bani&s;hment. Immediately after the execution of the Duke of Argyle, in 1685, Guthrie, &s;peaking of what acts of parliament had declared, &s;ays, 'they declared their abhorrence and dete&s;tation of all re&s;i&s;tance, upon whatever pretext, by deed, word, or writing; and, at la&s;t, they pa&s;&s;ed an act to approve whatever had been done by his maje&s;ty's Privy Cooncil, Ju&s;tice Court, and tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ionated by them in bani&s;hing, impri&s;oning, or fining &s;uch as refu&s;ed to take and &s;wear the oath of allegiance, and to a&s;&s;ert the royal prerogative in their utmo&s;t extent.'</P>
<P>Your lord&s;hip knows, that in this reign, and in the reign of his brother Charles II. a number of unfortunate people, becau&s;e they would not &s;ub&s;cribe bonds of peace and the oath of allegiance, were &s;ent by the Privy Council to the plantations, by &s;hip-loads; and al&s;o a number of conventiclers were remanded back to pri&s;on, till an opportunity &s;hould be afforded of tran&s;porting them to Barba|does, where no le&s;s than eighty of them were lying for tran&s;porta|tion. The king would never ratify a deed of the Privy Council, who bani&s;hed a man from his dominions in Scotland, to his domi|nions in England, becau&s;e he would not &s;wear the oath of allegi|ance. It is perfectly well known, that hundreds of our fellow-citizens were &s;eat in tho&s;e days to the plantations. My lord, I
<PB N="57" REF="027591_0057_0FD54C481B8257D8">
do not read this as an example for imitation; no man can ju&s;tify &s;uch arbitrary proceedings; but no man, I am &s;ure, was ever &s;ent from Scotland to England, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to take the oath of allegiance. I will &s;ay there is no in&s;tance of &s;uch a ca&s;e to be found; they were all &s;ent to the plantations; and, when your lord|&s;hip &s;ees this author, when &s;peaking of tho&s;e tran&s;portations, makes u&s;e of the word <HI>bani&s;hing</HI> only; and therefore, it is very clear that his idea of the word was the very &s;ame which I am now contend|ing for before your lord&s;hip, namely, that the word bani&s;hment is a general term; that tran&s;portation is only one mode of carrying it into effect, and that under the term bani&s;hment, tran&s;portation was intended by the act 1703.</P>
<P>My lord, independent of that, I might a&s;k your lord&s;hip, is it na|tural to &s;uppo&s;e, if it was their intention under this act, that no man &s;hould be tran&s;ported, that they would have made u&s;e of the very term which this Court have uniformly u&s;ed when they inflict|ed the puni&s;hment of tran&s;portation. No, my lord, the very re|ver&s;e is the natural &s;uppo&s;ition. Be&s;ides, I might &s;tate to your lord|&s;hips that the object of the legi&s;lature was merely to take away the capital part of the puni&s;hment; that is perfectly clear from the words of the act it&s;elf. It &s;ays, <Q>that in re&s;pect of their generali|ty, and the various con&s;truction which the &s;ame may admit, they may be as to the fore&s;aid capital puni&s;hment, of dangerous con&s;e|quence, doth, therefore, with advice and con&s;ent of the e&s;tates of Parliament, abrogate and di&s;charge, in all time coming, the fore|&s;aid &s;anction and pain of death and confi&s;cation contained in the &s;aids acts; and &s;tatutes and ordains, that the puni&s;hment of the crimes, therein mentioned, &s;hall for hereafter only be arbitrary,</Q> and then enumerates the puni&s;hment bani&s;hment, fining, and im|pri&s;onment, which were the common law puni&s;hments then in u&s;e. My lord, I beg leave to refer your lord&s;hips to the act 1701, where the power of tran&s;portation by this Court is expre&s;sly recognized. <Q>As al&s;o that no per&s;on be tran&s;ported furth of this kingdom, ex|cept with his own con&s;ent, given before a judge, or by legal &s;en|tence.</Q> I would a&s;k the gentleman where is the legal &s;tatute which authorizes tran&s;portation? I may, perhaps, be told, that the act 1670 authorizes tran&s;portation, becau&s;e they were to be bani&s;hed to the Indies; but I will remind them, that that act was re&s;cinded in 1690, the &s;econd act of the &s;econd parliament of Charles II. Here is the only act which mentions the bani&s;hing a man to the plantations, re&s;cinded in 1690; and yet, in 1701, we find an act expre&s;sly recognizing the power of tran&s;portation; becau&s;e it &s;ays, that no man is to be tran&s;ported but by his own con&s;ent, or by legal &s;entence. Where then is the &s;tatute that authorizes tran&s;|portation? I &s;ay there is no &s;uch thing; and therefore it is clear that it is included in the term bani&s;hment, otherwi&s;e there can be no legal &s;entence of tran&s;portation. The gentleman &s;ays that, by
<PB N="58" REF="027591_0058_0FD9B8419B7F90E8">
the act 1703, bani&s;hment is to be under&s;tood; and when an act enu|merates bani&s;hment, fining, and impri&s;onment, that you are not to enlarge tho&s;e, or introduce any other puni&s;hments which are not there &s;pecifically mentioned. I &s;hould be glad to know what ex|planation they are to give of the la&s;t clau&s;e of the act 1670, with re&s;pect to their refu&s;ing to depone as to conventicles. The object of that act was to di&s;cover meetings of conventiclers, and to declare the puni&s;hment to be inflicted upon tho&s;e who &s;hould refu&s;e, when called upon, to &s;ay what they knew re&s;pecting the&s;e conventicles; the puni&s;hment is to be fining, clo&s;e impri&s;onment, or bani&s;hment. The legi&s;lature fore&s;aw that when the man was called upon to de|clare what he knew, he might include and blame him&s;elf by &s;o do|ing, and therefore it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to enact a clau&s;e free|ing him from the puni&s;hment, and therefore it was provided, that no man's declaration again&s;t any other per&s;on &s;hould infer again&s;t him&s;elf the lo&s;s of life, or limb, or bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>My brother has told your lord&s;hip, upon the authority of Sir George Mackenzie, that bani&s;hment by tran&s;portation was illegal, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to confine a man to any place to which he is bani&s;hed, as though your lord&s;hip had a juri&s;diction over him while he is in that place undergoing the &s;entence of bani&s;hment; but that is not the ca&s;e, for from the moment he has once landed, your lord|&s;hip has no further authority; you are not confining him there; he may go where he likes, provided he does not return to this country. My lord, he has al&s;o appealed to another pa&s;&s;age in Mackenzie, to &s;hew that this was an illegal &s;entence in his ju&s;tification of the reign of Charles II. where it is &s;aid, that people were &s;ent abroad from a principle of mercy, becau&s;e the&s;e people might otherwi&s;e have been puni&s;hed by death; and, my lord, it is very true as applied to tho&s;e people who were taken at Bothwell Bridge in 1679; becau&s;e hi&s;tori|ans tell us, that about 1200 of them were taken with arms in their hands, and in open rebellion, it was therefore mercy to &s;end them a|broad and not try them for their lives; but it was only tho&s;e per&s;ons who refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe declarations that by the act 1670 were to be &s;ent abroad, and the privy council had an expre&s;s power of &s;ending them to the plantations.</P>
<P>My lord, it is a mi&s;take to &s;ay, that &s;ending people to the planta|tions, was for the fir&s;t time only introduced at the time of the rebel|lion at Bothwell Bridge; for all tho&s;e who were taken, a great ma|ny years before at the rebellion which was cru&s;hed at the Pentland Hills in 1667, I think, were &s;ent there likewi&s;e. And if your lord|&s;hip reads the hi&s;tory of this country prior to 1660, you will find a variety of in&s;tances where people were &s;ent to the plantations for re|fu&s;ing to &s;ub&s;cribe bonds of peace, and refu&s;ing to take the oath of allegiance. When was the fir&s;t time it was introduced into this country, I know not, however, I know from hi&s;tory, that it was not upon the pa&s;&s;ing of that act 1660; becau&s;e, my lord, I read of &s;hip loads of unfortunate people having been &s;ent away, who thought it
<PB N="59" REF="027591_0059_0FD9B83D7746B220">
incon&s;i&s;tent with their duty to &s;ub&s;cribe bonds of peace. My bro|ther has referred to the act of 1609, which mentions bani&s;hment; and his argument is that tran&s;portation could not have been intend|ed, becau&s;e tran&s;portation was unknown in tho&s;e days, and therefore it appears &s;ingular that the act 1609, when repealed by the act 1703, on account of the &s;everity of its &s;entence, &s;hould have enacted a pu|ni&s;hment much more &s;evere than the former. Upon what founda|tion or authority the gentleman &s;ays, a per&s;on could not have been tran&s;ported under the act 1609, I am at a lo&s;s to di&s;cover; for they had ju&s;t as much a power, and ju&s;t as much an opportunity of tran&s;|porting in 1609, as they had in 1660, when I know a great many tran&s;portations took place.</P>
<P>My lord, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why tran&s;portation could not have been indicted under in the year 1701, as well as 1660. But I will read to your lord&s;hip the la&s;t clau&s;e of the act 1609. "And neverthele&s;s, finding therin &s;ik malicious letts as the devile and his &s;uppo&s;ts do u|&s;ually &s;ugge&s;t to the hindrance of all ju&s;t and god<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie interpry&s;es, &s;pe|cially, by the fal&s;e and calumnious brutes; &s;peeches, and writs, crafte|lie uttered and di&s;per&s;ed by &s;ome laule&s;s ond &s;aulles people of this realme, a&s;well in privat conferences as in their meetings at taverns, all hou&s;es and playes, and by their pa&s;quills, lybels, rymes, cockalans, commedies, and &s;iklyke occa&s;ions, whereby they &s;lander, maligne, and revile the people, e&s;tate, and country of <HI>England,</HI> and divers his ma|je&s;ties honourable coun&s;ellers, magi&s;trates and worthie &s;ubjects, of that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s maje&s;ties kingdome.

Can your lord&s;hip believe, that as a puni&s;hment to men who had pro|duced &s;uch irreconcileable hatred between the two kingdoms, this act intended that they &s;hould be bani&s;hed into England, where they would have a much better opportunity of completing their purpo&s;e than they could have in Scotland. I am perfectly &s;ure a judge would have been laughed at who had &s;ent &s;uch a man into England. I am &s;atisfied that no &s;entence ever was pa&s;&s;ed upon this act. It was an act pa&s;&s;ed by Scotland, under the impre&s;&s;ion that England would pronounce a &s;imilar judgment. In evidence of this I &s;hall read to your lord&s;hip what Sir George Mackenzie &s;ays. <Q>But, in my opinion, this act reaches only &s;uch as &s;peak reproach|fully of their nation, country, and coun&s;ellors; but the whole act ought to be abrogated by our parliament, as being pa&s;t by us in expectation that England would make &s;uch an act in their par|liament, which they never did; and, upon which account, it was never in ob&s;ervance with us.</Q> I am perfectly &s;atisfied that if this act had ever been put in force, if any &s;entence had ever been im|po&s;ed, it mu&s;t have been tran&s;portation.</P>

further, neither of the po&s;itions laid down by my brother being applicable to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, becau&s;e it is not lea&s;ing-making, but &s;edition, &s;o near the crime of trea&s;on, that by the ancient trea&s;on laws of Scotland, it would amount to trea&s;on. The act at common law remains in full force, and I am perfectly clear whether you take the intention of the legi&s;lature, or whether you take the words them&s;elves as explained by hi&s;torians, by the le|gi&s;lature it&s;elf, and by the &s;entences of this Court and the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, your lord&s;hips cannot have a doubt, but that under the act of 1703, you have it in your power to &s;end this gentleman, or any other who may be found guilty of &s;edition, to tran&s;port him beyond &s;eas.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Mr. Montgomery, you have gone into it ve|ry ably and very fully.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> My lords, the points which you have now heard debated, are points upon which I have made up my mind mo&s;t fully, and which I &s;hould not be afraid to argue in any court, in a|ny place, or again&s;t any opponent. But, my lord, when I con&s;ider that this matter underwent a very full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion this day fortnight, and when I con&s;ider that your lord&s;hips, then heard the&s;e points &s;tat|ed with all the ability which the bar could furni&s;h (and I cannot &s;up|po&s;e that your lord&s;hips, have drank &s;o deeply of the waters of Lethe, as to have forgot what pa&s;&s;ed upon that occa&s;ion,) I think it unne|ce&s;&s;ary to trouble your lord&s;hip with many words, more e&s;pecially as &s;o much ju&s;tice has been done to it, by the gentleman who has already &s;poken.</P>
<P>My lord, as to the fir&s;t point, whether there is &s;uch a crime known in our law as that of &s;edition, I &s;hall not &s;ay a &s;ingle word, becau&s;e no per&s;on who knows any thing of our law, can entertain a &s;ingle doubt.</P>
<P>The next point is, whether the facts charged in this indictment do amount to the crime of &s;edition, yea or no? and after what we have heard &s;o fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and after what your lord&s;hips have de|termined upon the &s;ubject, I cannot &s;uppo&s;e that any argument is ne|ce&s;&s;ary upon this branch of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>My lord, you have been told that all the crime which this pannel has committed, is the entertaining ideas favourable to univer&s;al &s;uf|frage and annual parliaments, and in which ideas he was &s;anctioned by the mo&s;t re&s;pectable names. My lord, whatever opinion tho&s;e per&s;ons may privately entertain, I have not an opportunity to know, but I beg leave to a&s;k of the coun&s;el on the other &s;ide. who, I dare &s;ay, are better informed than I am. Have Mr. Pitt and the Duke of Richmond ever formed a convention in England? Have they ever called them&s;elves the Briti&s;h Convention? Have they ever called them&s;elves the repre&s;entatives of the body of the people? Have they ever told the parliament of Great Britain, that they &s;hall not pre&s;ume to di&s;per&s;e them? Have they ever told them that if they dared to bring into parliament a certain bill, they will re&s;i&s;t it by force? Or
<PB N="61" REF="027591_0061_0FDC052E8AADAC50">
have they told the public, that in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion, they will meet in a &s;ecret place? if they have done &s;o, it has been unknown to me &mdash;and if they have, it &s;ays very little for tho&s;e to whom the criminal laws of England are entru&s;ted. But as far as I know, no &s;uch thing has ever happened.</P>
<P>My brother, Gillies, who pleaded the cau&s;e with very great abili|ty, told your lord&s;hip, that even if the facts &s;tated were proved, as well as the criminal intention, (which I admit is ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential) that in that ca&s;e the libel ought not to be &s;u&s;tained as relevant, in &s;o far as the charges amount to high trea&s;on. Now, my lord, I will &s;o far agree with my brother, that in making out this charge before the jury, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;atisfy them that he had a crimi|nal intention, and if my brother can &s;hew me, that the facts charged in this indictment do come within the trea&s;on act, of Edward III. we &s;hall very &s;oon make a &s;hort argument of this ca&s;e, becau&s;e I &s;hall immediately de&s;ert the diet. We &s;hall have no more trial up|on this indictment, but I &s;hall immediately apply to your lord&s;hips, that that gentleman be committed for high trea&s;on. It is a thing I have fully con&s;idered, and I am perfectly &s;atisfied. I have no doubt of proving the intention, of which the jury will judge, and that they amount to &s;omething which is very near trea&s;on, the mo&s;t aggravated &s;pecies of &s;edition that can be imagined.</P>
<P>My lord, the only other point for con&s;ideration, relates to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he de|gree of puni&s;hment which your lord&s;hips have power to inflict, &s;up|po&s;ing the crime to be proved. Now, my lord, I apprehend it is per|fectly well e&s;tabli&s;hed, that bani&s;hment by tran&s;portation, which I &s;ay is a particular mode of bani&s;hment, is known to the common law of Scotland; it was a power exerci&s;ed by the Court of Se&s;&s;ion without a &s;tatute, and exerci&s;ed by all the criminal courts in Scotland. When this practice was fir&s;t introduced, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ay; but, I believe, much earlier than is generally &s;uppo&s;ed. It is &s;ufficient for me to &s;tate, that tran&s;portation is known to the law of Scotland, and is acknowledged and recognized in the fulle&s;t manner, by the act of 1701.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion therefore is, whether your lord&s;hips in judging of the crime of &s;edition, are re&s;trained from inflicting that puni&s;hment, &s;up|po&s;ing it to be a legal one. I mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;hew it to be a legal one, and then, whether there is any &s;tatute which re&s;trains the power of the court; and this leads me to con&s;ider the act 1703, which is the &s;ingle act that the gentleman found upon, as limiting the power of the court; and upon this &s;tatute it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay very lit|tle. Upon looking at the enacting clau&s;e, it appears to me, that the only purpo&s;e of the &s;tatute was to take away the capital part of it. It is very true, the act &s;ays that the court &s;hall inflict the puni&s;hment by fine, impri&s;onment, or bani&s;hment; and my brother tells your lord&s;hip, that there is a very material difference between bani&s;hment and tran&s;portation, and he &s;hows your lord&s;hip from John&s;on's Dic|tionary, Shake&s;peare, and other re&s;pectable authorities, that bani&s;h+ment
<PB N="62" REF="027591_0062_0FD54C21EBFB3378">
and tran&s;portation are different things: but I take it to be a very clear point, that in judging of the &s;tatute law of Scotland, we are not to go to an Engli&s;h dictionary, or to poetical writings&mdash;there can be but one authority, which is neither more nor le&s;s than the lan|guage of the common law of Scotland, and where are we to find it? We are to find it in the records of this &s;upreme court&mdash;&s;earch has been made in tho&s;e records, and by that &s;earch it is made clear, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of contradiction, that according to the law language of Scotland, before the &s;tatute, at the time of the &s;tatute, aad after the &s;tatute, that bani&s;hment did include tran&s;|portation.</P>
<P>My lord, in&s;tances were pointed out to your lord&s;hip, which it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to repeat, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible that they can be forgotten, in all of which your lord&s;hips inflicted the puni&s;hment of bani&s;hment; and, in order to carry that into execution, you or|dain and appoint the per&s;ons to be bani&s;hed beyond &s;eas.</P>
<P>My lord, I beg leave to mention one ca&s;e which has not occurred before, and that is a ca&s;e which happened in the month of February 1704, which your lord&s;hips will ob&s;erve was ju&s;t five months after pa&s;&s;ing the act upon which the gentleman found, the act of 1703, having been pa&s;&s;ed in the month of September, and this ca&s;e was de|termined in the February following. It was a ca&s;e which occurred before the Privy Council of Scotland, which your lord&s;hips know was at that time a court inve&s;ted with a juri&s;diction of a very con&s;idera|ble extent. It was a trial upon lea&s;ing-making, (the very crime up|on which the gentlemen found their argument) upon the 4th of Fe|bruary 1704, a libel again&s;t Mr. David Bailie, brother to Captain Robert Bailie, of Manor Hall, for lea&s;ing-making, and the conclu&s;ion of it, after &s;etting forth the fact is, that the afore&s;aid David Bailie, ought to be &s;everely puni&s;hed for the &s;ame, with the pains of law, at lea&s;t conform to the 4th act of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the current parlia|ment, entitled, "act anent lea&s;ing-makers and &s;landerers." Here your lord&s;hip &s;ees this libel &s;pecially refers to the &s;tatute 1703, and prays, upon the party being convicted, that he &s;hould be &s;everely puni&s;hed for the &s;ame, with the pains of law, at lea&s;t conform to the 4th act of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the current parlia|ment. My lords, this was tried before a court who did not &s;it at the di&s;tance of ninety years, but who &s;at within five months after the act pa&s;&s;ed; and therefore, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that they under&s;tood its meaning; and, my lord, I ob&s;erve by the &s;ederunt, that the pre|&s;ident of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion was there, the Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk was there, and many other of the judges, and therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible they could mi&s;take its meaning. In the fir&s;t place the party acknow|ledges the offence; and therefore there was no need of any trial as to his guilt; and in the next place he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by no le&s;s than &s;ix able coun&s;el, and a great deal of argument there was upon it&mdash;but when you come to the &s;entence, "the libel having been found rele|vant to infer arbitrary puni&s;hment, that the two letters libelled on
<PB N="63" REF="027591_0063_0FD54C4D5E929578">
were all his hand-writing, the court hereby ordain and adjudge, that the &s;aid David Bailie be tran&s;ported to the We&s;t Indies, that he be &s;et in the pillory from eleven to twelve in the forenoon, and in ca&s;e the per&s;on cannot pay the fine, to be tran&s;ported, and to be kept in the pri&s;on of Ayr until he be &s;o tran&s;ported."</P>
<P>My lord, I know very well that it is not the fa&s;hion of the times to think a great deal of our ance&s;tors, but I &s;hall admit, that in point of wi&s;dom, in point of philology, in point of philo&s;ophy, and many other fine &s;peculative ideas, I will admit that our forefathers were by no means comparable to us in tho&s;e fine theories which modern philo&s;ophy has found out with regard to religion and government; witne&s;s the glorious &s;tate of France at this moment. But, my lords, can we under&s;tand that act better than they did? Did not they know their own meaning better than we do? And yet your lord|&s;hip &s;ees the judges who &s;at in that very parliament, within five months after &s;itting in a court of ju&s;tice, upon a ca&s;e in point, they under&s;tood the meaning of bani&s;hment, and they tran&s;ported him to the We&s;t-Indies; and, my lord, this is not all, I &s;ee, at this time, the gentleman was not undefended, he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ix able coun|&s;el, and not one of them pretends to &s;ay he had the &s;malle&s;t doubt a|bout it; they argued many points of law, but this was not &s;o much as mentioned, it was clear beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of doubt that it in|cluded tran&s;portation. I cannot have a doubt, but that your lord|&s;hips, upon the fair con&s;truction of this act, have the power, in ca&s;e this pannel &s;hould be convicted by the verdict of a jury; but it will be with your lord&s;hips to judge whether you think he merits it or not. This is a complete an&s;wer to the two ca&s;es the gentleman has cited. The act does not bind you to tran&s;port, but it is an arbitrary puni&s;hment in the di&s;cretion of the court; and, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, it will be with your lord&s;hips to judge whether you think the extent of the crime merits &s;uch puni&s;hment. Your lord&s;hips can have very little doubt about the matter, and, I think the proper time for that determination, would be after the verdict of the jury.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Laing.</HI> My Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk. By your lord&s;hips appoint|ment I have undertaken a cau&s;e which I at fir&s;t declined, not only from per&s;onal con&s;iderations, which I forbear to mention, but becau&s;e my recent avocations have been very different from the pur&s;uits of this bar. The cau&s;e of my client, though undertaken by your order, in now my own; and I will plead for him, as I would for my&s;elf, were I placed in his &s;ituation at the bar. No con&s;iderations &s;hall now deter me, nor &s;hall the fear of obloquy relax my efforts to e&s;ta|bli&s;h his innocence, and overturn the prepo&s;terous charges of this in|dictment.</P>
<P>The arguments maintained on the relevancy may be reduced to three propo&s;itions, to which, whatever illu&s;trations or additional ar|guments my recollection and my &s;trength may enable me to contri|bute, &s;hall be &s;pecifically directed.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="64" REF="027591_0064_0FD54C2483F90F30">1. That the facts charged in the indictment are not of a crimi|nal nature; or if criminal, that they con&s;titute merely a &s;tatutory offence.</P>
<P N="2">2. That where the crime is provided for by &s;tatute, a &s;everer, or a different puni&s;hment cannot legally be inflicted at common law.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the puni&s;hment of the facts charged in the indictment, if indeed criminal, are, as regulated by 1703, chap. 4, fine, impri&s;on|ment, or bani&s;hment; meaning thereby bani&s;hment forth of the realm alone.</P>
<P>My lord, on the fir&s;t propo&s;ition, that the facts charged in the in|dictment, if criminal con&s;titute a &s;tatutory offence, the argument of the pro&s;ecutor amounts to this, that &s;edition is a technical or gene|rick term, comprehending a variety of different crimes; yet un&s;u&s;|ceptible, at the &s;ame time, of a definition applicable to every crime. That there is no definition of &s;edition &s;trictly applicable to each ca&s;e, I &s;hall readily admit, for the definitions given by our lawyers are founded on a previous di&s;tinction between real, and verbal &s;edition. The former is uniformly de&s;cribed as an actual commotion, or ri&s;ing of the people; the latter, the utterance of fal&s;e reports, or the pub|lication of writings <HI>tending</HI> to excite &s;uch commotions, or to overturn the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution or government. My lord, this is not an ideal di&s;tinction; it originates from the very nature of crimes, from the difference between the attempt and the deed, from the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;tingui&s;hing between what is actually committed, and that which is perhaps an abortive attempt to effect the deed. In murder, a con&s;piracy again&s;t our neighbour's life, when carried into execution, mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from an attempt to in&s;tigate another to the commi&s;&s;ion of murder. So in perjury, &s;ubordination of evidence is a crime of a very different complexion from perjury it&s;elf. Here then is a di&s;tinction never to be removed from the na|ture of crimes; the intention alone does not con&s;titute the crime; unle&s;s it is carried into execution it cannot amount to the crime which it failed to accompli&s;h. This di&s;tinction is al&s;o founded in the nature of crimes again&s;t the &s;tate, which, I ob&s;erve, are all re|ducible to &s;edition, to trea&s;on, and to verbal &s;edition. Whatever tends to the de&s;truction of the &s;tate may be termed &s;edition; but there are acts of &s;edition exalted to trea&s;on, ennobled on account of their dangerous con&s;equences, and puni&s;hed as trea&s;on, by attain|der, forfeiture, and a rigorous death. Sedition it&s;elf, is a popular commotion to the ob&s;truction of law, or the interruption of public tranquility, not directed, however, again&s;t the con&s;titution, nor a|mounting to trea&s;on. (Thus an in&s;urrection though in arms, to de&s;troy an inclo&s;ure, is in England a riot, in Scotland &s;edition; but an in&s;urrection to de&s;troy all inclo&s;ures con&s;titutes trea&s;on.) But there is a crime different from this; there is an attempt to excite, or to commit &s;edition; an attempt which, in trea&s;on, and in trea|&s;on alone, is converted into an overt act, and, on account of its dan|gerous con&s;equences, puni&s;hed by &s;tatute, as trea&s;on it&s;elf. State
<PB N="65" REF="027591_0065_0FD54C4EDEEB5438">
crimes, therefore, are either &s;edition or the attempt to excite it, or certain actions converted, for the pre&s;ervation of the &s;tate, into trea&s;on. I conclude, therefore, both from the nature of crimes in general, and from the di&s;tinctions e&s;&s;ential to crimes again&s;t the &s;tate, that an attempt to commit &s;edition never can con&s;titute actu|al &s;edition.</P>
<P>This di&s;tinction, and the&s;e definitions may be variou&s;ly illu&s;tra|ted. Nor in a que&s;tion concerning the &s;ignification of terms, will your lord&s;hips reject the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of philology, or of any &s;cience that a&s;certains their common acceptation, or their proper import. If we re&s;ort then to the acceptation of the word in our own lan|guage, &s;edition is defined by John&s;on, our greate&s;t philologi&s;t <Q>a tumult, an in&s;urrection, a popular commotion, an uproar.</Q> Here an actual commotion is &s;pecified, not that &s;editious attempt, the tendency, or the de&s;ign of which is to excite commotion. If we examine its etymology, &s;edition, <HI>&s;eor&s;um itio,</HI> is a &s;eparation or &s;e|ce&s;&s;ion from the body of the people; and in this &s;en&s;e, the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of the Roman people to the Aventine mount, would have been a &s;edition, had not the cau&s;e of the people ultimately triumphed. But the &s;peeches of Sicinius, which produced that &s;ece&s;&s;ion, what|ever was their tendency, could never with propriety be denomina|ted &s;edition. The &s;edition de&s;cribed by Virgil.
<Q><L>Ac veluti magno in populo cum &s;aepe coorta e&s;t</L>
<L>Seditio, faevitque animis ignobile vulgus,</L>
<L>Jamque faces et &s;axa volant, furor arma mini&s;trat;</L></Q>
the actual commotion de&s;cribed in this &s;imile is very different from that attempt to create &s;edition, of which the brutal Appius accu&s;es the fa|ther and the lover of Virginia&mdash;<HI>"Certis indiciis compertum &s;e habere, nocte tota coetus in urbe factos ad movendam &s;editionem.</HI> Li|vy." Convocations were formed in the city, and during the night, but Virginius and Icilius were only accu&s;ed of attempting, by the&s;e nocturnal convocations, to &s;tir up the people to actual &s;edition.</P>
<P>My lord, the application of this di&s;tinction is &s;ufficient to determine the nature of the crime. If the <HI>corpus delicti</HI> con&s;i&s;ts opinions and &s;peeches, or in re&s;olutions the concurrence of opinions and re&s;ult of &s;peeches, the&s;e are criminal on account of their tendency to excite &s;e|dition, or di&s;turbance in the &s;tate. The tendency of the offence con|&s;titutes the guilt; for I maintain, that in them&s;elves the &s;peeches are not criminal. The re&s;olutions, if locked up in the brea&s;t, the &s;peech|es, if uttered to the winds of the de&s;ert, the writings, if concealed in our repo&s;itories from human ob&s;ervation, are neither criminal nor obnoxious to puni&s;hment. In the celebrated ca&s;e of Algernon Syd|ney, the papers di&s;covered in his cabinet, and never promulgated, af|forded no legal evidence of trea&s;on, and would have con&s;tituted no &s;pecies whatever of &s;edition. I repeat it therefore, that the &s;peeches are not in them&s;elves criminal. The man who writes, without at|tempting to di&s;&s;eminate or to publi&s;h, a &s;editious compo&s;ition, may
<PB N="66" REF="027591_0066_0FD54C259D585C10">
remain in the country as an innocent citizen; and, however di&s;af|fected in &s;ecret to government, will &s;till enjoy the protection of its laws. Your lord&s;hips will therefore ob&s;erve, that it is not the <HI>malus animus</HI> which is puni&s;hable, not that mind which is ho&s;tile to the &s;tate, but the declaration of that ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition <HI>malo animo,</HI> to the effect of exciting di&s;turbance, or with a de&s;ign to generate &s;imilar ho&s;tili|ty in the minds of others. The fact it&s;elf may be inoffen&s;ive; the attempt may be impotent; but the attempt, though fru&s;trated, then becomes criminal when dangerous to &s;ociety; and its tendency is the circum&s;tance which con&s;titutes the crime.</P>
<P>My lord, the principle which I have thus endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h, is fully recognized in the law of England, in which contempts or mi&s;pri&s;ions again&s;t the king or government, offences equivalent to verbal &s;edition, are puni&s;hed on account of their tendency alone. "Contempts and mi&s;pri&s;ions (&s;ays Black&s;tone) again&s;t the king's <HI>per&s;on</HI> and <HI>government,</HI> may be by &s;peaking or writing again&s;t them, cur&s;ing or wi&s;hing him ill, giving out &s;candalous &s;tories concerning him, or doing any thing that may <HI>tend</HI> to le&s;&s;en him in the e&s;teem of his &s;ubjects, <HI>may</HI> weaken his government, or <HI>may</HI> rai&s;e jea|lou&s;ies between him and his people." Though denied in argument, the principle is acknowledged in the indictment it&s;elf. The <HI>corpus delicti</HI> is there &s;tated, as "of the mo&s;t dangerous and de&s;tructive <HI>ten|dency,</HI> ho&s;tile to the peace and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, and <HI>tending</HI> to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution of the realm." In every other indictment for verbal &s;edition, the &s;ame tendency has been uniformly charged.</P>
<P>But, in oppo&s;ition to the concurrent authority of lawyers, in contradiction to that e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinction between a crime attempt|ed, and actually committed, &s;edition, it is &s;aid, is a technical epi|thet, expre&s;&s;ive of a variety of di&s;tinct crimes, but incapable of a definition to which every &s;editious offence may be reduced. Se|dition is repre&s;ented as a hydra united below in a common trunk, but di&s;parted above into a thou&s;and heads. Of the &s;editious it is &s;aid,
<Q><L>Their aims are various, as the paths they take</L>
<L>In journeying through life.</L></Q>
Nor are their crimes, though obnoxious to legal penalties, reduci|ble to any legal definition or &s;tandard.</P>
<P>My an&s;wer is this, that the &s;uppo&s;ed variety, &s;o un&s;u&s;ceptible of de|finition, proceeds from the creation of various &s;tatuory acts of &s;edition, ju&s;t as le&s;&s;er offences are &s;ometimes converted into &s;tatutory trea&s;ons. Simple convocation, unarmed conventions not tumultuous, bonds and leagues among &s;ubjects, are acts of &s;edition created by &s;tatute, and certainly not included in the legal definition affixed to &s;edition: an actual commotion or in&s;urrection of the people. But at common law, the definition is not the le&s;s true, that certain acts not comprehended under it, have been declared by &s;tatute tantamount to &s;edition, and &s;anctioned by the penalties attached to that crime. In trea&s;on, of
<PB N="67" REF="027591_0067_0FD54C5061252738">
which the definition, contrary to what has been formerly a&s;&s;erted, is preci&s;e and explicit, in trea&s;on, which con&s;i&s;ts in counteracting, or be|traying that allegiance due from the &s;ubject by birth or re&s;idence, 'the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">zeal of the legi&s;lature,' according to Black&s;tone, 'has &s;ometimes de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">arted from this its primitive idea.' To a&s;&s;ert that the legi&s;lature cannot limit or alter the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is a &s;tatutory trea&s;on, not com|pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nded under its legal definition. But the legal definition is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>My lord, the authority of Er&s;kine and of Bayne has been al&s;o quoted, to prove, that real &s;edition is a convocation without autho|rity, tending to di&s;turb the tranquility of the public. Had the gen|tleman quoted the preceeding &s;entence from Er&s;kine, that <Q>&s;edition, con&s;i&s;ts in rai&s;ing commotions or di&s;turbances in the &s;tate;</Q> your lord&s;hip would have perceived from the context <Q>Such commo|tions as are directly again&s;t the &s;overeign or the &s;tate, amount to high trea&s;on, but where rai&s;ed to redre&s;s &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed grievance, are properly &s;edition,</Q> that the intermediate pa&s;&s;age, related, not to peaceful and unarmed conventions; but to tho&s;e irregular and tumultuous convocations, that are always riotous. Bayne, who&s;e in&s;titutions are a brief and imperfect ab&s;tract from M'Kenzies, has obviou&s;ly confounded &s;edition at common law with a &s;tatutory of|fence. Popular commotions to the ob&s;truction of law, or the di&s;|turbance of public peace, were puni&s;hed at common law; unarmed conventions whatever was their tendency, prohibited by &s;tatute. Happily the laws again&s;t peaceful, unarmed conventions are con&s;ign|ed to oblivion; but to the definition of real &s;edition at common law, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ayne has added a convocation of citizens without authority, and to render it illegal, &s;pecifies its <HI>tendency</HI> to di&s;turb &s;ociety. If tu|multuous, the convocation was illegal at common law, but the &s;ta|tutory crime of convention, to which the definition of &s;edition is thus arbitrarily extended, was illegal whatever was its tendency, whe|ther directed to the wor&s;hip of God, or to the ob&s;truction of public tranquility and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Such then, my lord, is the law. I &s;hall now proceed to examine, the facts &s;pecified in the indictment, whether, and how far they a|mount to the crime of which my client is accu&s;ed. The fir&s;t is, his acce&s;&s;ion to an illegal and &s;editious convention; for I will not pre&s;ume that a peaceable convention of an innocent tendency, con|&s;titutes a criminal charge to-day. The illegality of &s;uch a conven|tion mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in the objects to which it was directed, its &s;editi|ous nature in the mea&s;ures adopted to attain the&s;e objects. I &s;hall therefore examine, fir&s;t the objects propo&s;ed by the convention, and then the mode in which the&s;e were pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>And here, my lord, I affirm, that annual parliaments and univer|&s;al &s;uffrage, the &s;ole objects propo&s;ed by the convention, are legiti|mate and con&s;titutional objects of pur&s;uit. The&s;e are principles re|cognized in the theory of our con&s;titution, nor que&s;tionable unle&s;s as expedient in practice. Annual parliaments are confe&s;&s;edly a
<PB N="68" REF="027591_0068_0FD7BF04EDB6ED38">
que&s;tion of mere expediency, like tho&s;e of a triennial or &s;eptennial duration. They were appointed, and their legitimacy recognized by different &s;tatutes, the 3 and 34 of Edward III. and continued, till Richard II. in who&s;e unfortunate reign the u&s;e of long parlia|ments was fir&s;t introduced. Your lord&s;hips cannot be ignorant that motions for annual parliaments have been annually renewed in the Hou&s;e of Commons; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary for me to a&s;&s;ert the con&s;titu|tional nature of a que&s;tion, which, in 1745, when agitated in the Hou&s;e of Commons, on the motion of Mr. Carew, was negatived only by a majority of thirty two.</P>
<P>But your lord&s;hips hitherto have uniformly reprobated univer&s;al &s;uffrage, as an illegal object, repugnant to the principles of our hap|py con&s;titution; productive of anarchy, the &s;ources of mi&s;ery; and, as no people have a right to will their own mi&s;ery, it is inferred, that none are entitled to univer&s;al &s;uffrage. Without controverting this logical education, I &s;hall argue, not to a political, but to a legal effect, that univer&s;al &s;uffrage is a principle conformable to the &s;pirit, and recognized in the theory of our con&s;titution, though from motives of expediency, not adopted in practice to its utmo&s;t extent. What is the object propo&s;ed by univer&s;al &s;uffrage? That freemen, who po&s;|&s;e&s;s an independent will, not &s;ubjugated to the power of another, &s;hall enjoy, each his &s;uffrage, in the election of tho&s;e repre&s;entatives by who&s;e acts they are bound, by whom their property is di&s;po&s;ed of, and their conduct regulated. Who are excluded in this &s;cheme of repre&s;entation? Idiots, minors, paupers, and criminals, all tho&s;e who have no will of their own, or what is equivalent, no hone&s;t or inde|pendent will. What then is the theory of repre&s;entation in the Bri|ti&s;h con&s;titution? That tho&s;e only &s;hall be excluded from voting, who&s;e &s;ituation is &s;uch that they cannot be pre&s;umed to have a will of their own. Each proceeds on this common principle that the per&s;ons of freemen, are repre&s;ented, not their property, and each a&s;pires to this &s;ublime idea, that the &s;y&s;tem of repre&s;entation &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed on a ba&s;is as broad as its &s;uper&s;tructure. The practice of our con&s;titu|tion has degenerated, it is true, from its theoretical perfection, whe|ther, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, from the imperfection natural to the human race, or, as others imagine, from the decay and decriptitude of eve|ry human in&s;titution. But the principles, my lord, are the &s;ame. Idi|ots and criminals are excluded in the &s;cheme of univer&s;al &s;uffrage, on the principle that they have no will of their own, and on the &s;ame pre&s;umption, poverty, in the practice of our con&s;titution, is a cau&s;e of exclu&s;ion. Qualifications of property are therefore no principle in our con&s;titution, but a te&s;t of that principle which our con&s;titution re|quires. In&s;tead of con&s;tituting, as has been erroneou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted, the right of &s;uffrage, they are merely a te&s;t of that independent &s;uffrage, which, by the principles of our con&s;titution, is con&s;idered as the inhe|rent birth-right of every Briti&s;h freeman.</P>
<P>My lord, this is no new doctrine which I now maintain. It is &s;upported by the mo&s;t popular, and let me add, the mo&s;t orthodox
<PB N="69" REF="027591_0069_0FD7BEE049F09228">
writers on the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. Monte&s;quieu, in a pa&s;&s;age, (which as the French may implicate &s;edition, I &s;hall tran&s;late to your lord&s;hip) maintains: <Q>That in England, all the citizens, in their different di&s;tricts, ought to have a right of &s;uffrage in the choice of their repre&s;entatives; tho&s;e only excepted, who&s;e &s;itua|tion is &s;o vile, that they mu&s;t be reputed to have no will of their own." To the &s;ame purport Black&s;tone informs us, 'As to the qualifications of the electors. The true rea&s;on of requiring any qualification, with regard to property in votes, is to exclude &s;uch per&s;ons as are in &s;o mean a &s;ituation that they are e&s;teemed to have no will of their own. If the&s;e per&s;ons had votes, they would be tempted to di&s;po&s;e of them under &s;ome undue influence or other. This would give a great, an artful, or a wealthy man, a larger &s;hare in elections than is con&s;i&s;tent with general liberty. If it were probable, that every man would give his vote freely, and without influence of any kind, then, upon the true theory and genuine principles of liberty, every member of the commu|nity, however poor, &s;hould have a vote in electing tho&s;e dele|gates, to who&s;e charge is committed the di&s;po&s;al of his property, his liberty, and his life. But, &s;ince that can hardly be expected, in per&s;ons of indigent fortunes, or &s;uch as are under the immedi|ate dominion of others, all popular &s;tates have been obliged to e|&s;tabli&s;h certain qualifications; whereby &s;ome, who are &s;u&s;pected to have no will of their own, are excluded from voting, in or|der to &s;et other individuals, who&s;e wills may be &s;uppo&s;ed inde|pendent, more thoroughly upon a level with each other. This," he continues, "is the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution: not that I a&s;&s;ert it is in fact quite &s;o perfect as I have endeavoured to de&s;cribe it; for, if any alteration might be wi&s;hed or &s;ugge&s;ted in the pre&s;ent frame of parliaments, it &s;hould be in favour of a more complete repre&s;entation of the people.</Q></P>
<P>Here, my lord, univer&s;al &s;uffrage is repre&s;ented by Black&s;tone as congenial to freedom, and the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution, qualifica|tions, as the te&s;t of an independent &s;uffrage. But why this te&s;t? Not that an univer&s;al equality of &s;uffrage is productive of anarchy, anarchy of mi&s;ery; but without &s;uch te&s;t, that the opulent would arrogate an undue influence incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty. The te&s;t is ju&s;tified, not as preclu&s;ive of a dangerous equality, but becau&s;e it re&s;tores, to tho&s;e that are independent, their equality of &s;uffrage. The que&s;tion which Black&s;tone has thus determined, is decided differently by a judge in India. Sir William Jones has a&s;&s;erted the expediency, as well as the right of univer&s;al &s;uffrage, nor is that accompli&s;hed, and celebrated &s;cholar &s;ingular in a que&s;tion agitated &s;o variou&s;ly by the able&s;t politicians. While the princi|ple has ever been acknowledged in theory, the expediency of uni|ver&s;al &s;uffrage has been determined, in the negative by Mr. Fox, in the affirmative publickly, in re&s;olutions i&s;&s;ued from &s;uch a con|vention as the pre&s;ent, by his oponent Mr. Pitt.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="027591_0070_0FD54C2960CE4CD8">But to what purpo&s;e do I quote the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, or appeal to the authority of the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed names? To demon&s;trate to your lord&s;hips, that univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual parliaments, the pro|fe&s;&s;ed object of the Briti&s;h Convention, are legitimate and con&s;ti|tutional objects of pur&s;uit. It is to convince your lord&s;hips that the&s;e objects are &s;trictly con&s;titutional, and acknowledged in theo|ry; and that their expediency in practice is the only que&s;tion. But, my lord, this is a que&s;tion to be debated between man and man, a que&s;tion fit for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of Commons, not for the cognizance of a court of law. It is a que&s;tion on which the wi&s;e&s;t and the greate&s;t have differed, but let it not be told in England, that univer&s;al &s;uffrage, a principle e&s;&s;ential in the theory of its con&s;titution, has been arraigned as &s;editious, and pro&s;cribed as uncon&s;titutional, in a Scotti&s;h Court.</P>
<P>Such then, my lord, were the profe&s;&s;ed principles, and &s;uch the o&s;ten&s;ible objects of the Briti&s;h Convention. It remains to exa|mine the mode propo&s;ed, or the mea&s;ures adopted, to accompli&s;h the&s;e legal con&s;titutional objects; but in the &s;peeches and re&s;olu|tions, charged as &s;editious in this indictment, what is there to in|dicate that the &s;ecret motives of the convention were different, that its de&s;igns were criminal, or as the public pro&s;ecutor has hardly a&s;&s;erted, that <HI>a plan was deliberately formed 'o &s;ubvert the con&s;titution?</HI> I &s;hall examine, my lord, as conci&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible, the re&s;olutions and &s;peeches contained in the indictment.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is a &s;peech extracted from the Gazetteer, and a&s;cribed to Mr. Gerrald, in the Briti&s;h Convention. My lord, I affirm that this &s;peech is legal and con&s;titutional throughout, and perfectly conform|able to the profe&s;&s;ed object of that a&s;&s;ociation. It begins by &s;tating, that after the union of the crowns, on the acce&s;&s;ion of James to the throne of England, <Q>the people of both countries, were dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed of &s;ome of their mo&s;t valuable privileges.</Q> And who will deny, that during the &s;anguinary reign of the Stuarts, the mo&s;t dangerous en|croachments were made on our liberties? Who will maintain that the privileges of the people were not then invaded; privileges which, in &s;ome in&s;tances, the revolution has not entirely re&s;tored? But the &s;peech proceeds to e&s;tabli&s;h univer&s;al &s;uffrage, not only as our birth-right by nature, but as a right actually enjoyed under the Saxon go|vernment, and exerci&s;ed from the Norman Conque&s;t or Robbery, (a rob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery, my lord, it undoubtedly was) abridged the inheritance of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">xon ance&s;tors. To re&s;tore this natural right, to recover this inherent principle, as it is termed, of our con&s;titution, it propo&s;es the mo&s;t peaceable and legal means, that the people &s;hould be in&s;tructed in its importance, and per&s;uaded to &s;olicit its re&s;titution by petitions to parliament. My lord, this is not the language of &s;edition, but an a&s;&s;ertion of our unalienable right to petition either branch of the le|gi&s;lature. But there are pa&s;&s;ages &s;uppo&s;ed to indicate a different in|tention. The petitions were to be &s;ub&s;cribed by a majority of the people, <Q>by a number &s;o re&s;pectable as to <HI>command</HI> attention; and
<PB N="71" REF="027591_0071_0FD5236540B4A618">
it will &s;oon have that re&s;pectability, if we have rea&s;on on our &s;ide.</Q> On this invidious con&s;truction, my brother and my friend has &s;uffici|ently commented. Were <HI>command</HI> (than which I know not a hap|pier phra&s;e) expre&s;&s;ive of a compul&s;ive force to overawe the legi&s;la|ture, its correlative would be <HI>obey;</HI> but here the attention which truth and numbers may be figuratively &s;aid to command or enforce, and which certainly they &s;trongly &s;olicit, is <HI>yielded</HI> by parliament, who&s;e atten|tion cannot be &s;aid to <HI>obey.</HI></P>
<P>The next article of the indictment di&s;clo&s;es the grand arcana of &s;edition; the re&s;olution a&s;cribed to the convention of re&s;i&s;ting the authority of the legi&s;lature, concerning which I &s;hall fir&s;t examine its import, and then its criminal amount and complexion. I mu&s;t pre|mi&s;e, however, that in a ca&s;e like the pre&s;ent, wherever a declaration is equally &s;u&s;ceptible of two con&s;truction, that which is innocent is to be received as its genuine interpretation and &s;en&s;e. Your lord|&s;hips may remember the trial of Lord Strafford. An accu&s;atian a|gain&s;t him was, that he &s;aid in the public ball at York <Q>that the lit|tle finger of prerogative &s;hould lie heavier upon them than the loins of the law.' By inverting the expre&s;&s;ion thus, that 'the little fin|ger of the law was heavier than the loins of prerogative,</Q> he fairly explained it away. The Commons per&s;i&s;ted in this accu&s;ation; but their illiberal con&s;truction of a &s;entence &s;u&s;ceptible of a different mean|ing, has been reprobated by every hi&s;torian as oppre&s;&s;ive and illegal. If words, therefore can abmit of two con&s;tructions, that which is mo&s;t favourable to innocence mu&s;t always be adopted.</P>
<P>My lord, to proceed to the re&s;olution, the fir&s;t part of it &s;tates, in general, That <Q>if any uncon&s;titutional act be propo&s;ed in parliament, incon&s;i&s;tent with, or &s;ubver&s;ive of, our known con&s;titutional liber|ties, we declare, before God and the world, that we &s;hall follow the whole&s;ome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which &s;hall militate again&s;t the con&s;titution of the country; and &s;hall continue to a&s;&s;emble, and con&s;ider of the be&s;t means by which we can accompli&s;h a real repre&s;entation of the people, and annual election, until compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force.</Q> What is the import, then, of following 'the whole&s;ome example of former times?' They meant, it is &s;aid, to fly in the face of all con&s;tituted authority, and to re&s;i&s;t the government. But is this the whole&s;ome example of former times? No, this is not the ca&s;e; for the expre&s;&s;ion is immedi|ately explained by the context, <Q>by paying no regard to any act which'&mdash;&s;hall do what? 'Which &s;hall militate again&s;t the con&s;titu|tion of this country;</Q> and how di&s;regard it? Not by active and forcible re&s;i&s;tance; but with all the re&s;ignation of a quaker; by that pa&s;&s;ive re&s;i&s;tance which a quaker would &s;hew, were he to enter the Court, and remain with his head covered, till your lord&s;hips macer &s;hould take off his hat. He &s;ubmits pa&s;&s;ively to the laws of his coun|try, when exerted, to which, at the &s;ame time, he pays no previous regard. But the re&s;olution amounts to this, that the members a&s;&s;oci|ated, or delegated, to obtain univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual parlia|ments,
<PB N="72" REF="027591_0072_0FD54C2BA085C670">
on the fir&s;t notice of a bill to &s;uppre&s;s their convention and to fru&s;trate the&s;e their con&s;titutional objects, &s;hall a&s;&s;emble immediately, nor depart till the law, in the event of its being enacted, &s;hall receive its full operation on them. They a&s;&s;emble on the fir&s;t notice of the bill, for this obvious rea&s;on, that no meeting could take place when it pa&s;&s;ed into a law. They a&s;&s;emble to depreciate, and, by every legal endeavour, to prevent its pa&s;&s;ing. But they will continue to a&s;&s;emble till compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force. To di&s;cover the criminal nature of this pa&s;&s;ive re&s;i&s;tance, of this re&s;olution to obey upon com|pul&s;ion only, let us &s;uppo&s;e, for a moment, that an act obviou&s;ly un|con&s;titutional were adopted by legi&s;lature; that monarchy, no mat|ter how improbable, were abrogated forever, what would be the conduct of every peaceable citizen intere&s;ted in its &s;upport? I would appeal to your lord&s;hips, &s;worn as you are to abide by monarchy, that you would re&s;i&s;t, pa&s;&s;ively at lea&s;t, though not perhaps forcibly, that act which you thought uncon&s;titutional, and continue to meet in Court, by regal authority, 'till compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force.' Such would undoubtedly be your lord&s;hip's conduct, and &s;uch is the preci&s;e conduct which the convention ob&s;erved. Their ideas of re|&s;i&s;tance, their re&s;olution not to de&s;i&s;t till compelled by &s;uperior force, are explained, and the extent of both a&s;certained, by the compul&s;ion in con&s;equence of which they de&s;i&s;ted, and the force by which they were actually di&s;per&s;ed. Their re&s;olution was not <HI>to re&s;i&s;t;</HI> it was <HI>to de&s;i&s;t</HI> till compelled by force; and when my friend Mr. David&s;on, the &s;heriff, laid hold of the pre&s;ident's arm, to remove him from the chair, 'No, Sir,' &s;ays the pre&s;ident, <Q>this is not force enough; a lit|tle more if you plea&s;e;</Q> accordingly the &s;heriff, by a very gentle exertion, removed him from the chair. The whole was a &s;cenic exhibition; and truly, my lord, where the force was &s;o ludicrous, a re&s;olution not to de&s;i&s;t till &s;uch force was exerted, can never be cri|minal.</P>
<P>My lord, the re&s;olution proceeds, <Q>and in ea&s;e of an inva&s;ion to rea&s;&s;emble in convention.</Q> The con&s;truction impo&s;ed upon this is, that the convention meant to join, or a&s;&s;i&s;t the invaders. My explanation is very different, that it was the intention of the mem|bers, by every effort in their power, to re&s;i&s;t an inva&s;ion. The re|&s;olution concludes thus, <Q>that all, or any one of the&s;e calamitous circum&s;tances,</Q> (and an inva&s;ion is one of the preceding circum+&s;tances,) '&s;hall be a &s;ignal for the members to meet in convention.' But why calamitus, if they did not confider it really as &s;uch? If they did not mean to avert that calamity, why repre&s;ent it to the people or to them&s;elves, as a mo&s;t calamitous circum&s;tance? Can a|ny thing more explicitly point out their intention? Or when the whole re&s;olution is con&s;idered, can your lord&s;hips impo&s;e any other con&s;truction than this upon it, that the intention of the members was, by every exertion, to avert that which they ju&s;tly repre&s;ented as a national calamity.</P>
<P>Now, my lord, having determined the &s;en&s;e and import, let us

examine the criminal amount of a re&s;olution con&s;idered as &s;o alarm|ing and dangerous, that the con&s;titution, in the opinion of &s;ome wi&s;e men, totters already to its very foundation. A refu&s;al to yield an implicit, uncompelled obedience, to an act who&s;e exi&s;tence is on|ly potential, on the &s;uppo&s;ition too of its proving an uncon&s;tituti|onal act, is charged to-day as a direct attack on the authority of the legi&s;lature, con&s;tituting a &s;pecies of real and atrocious &s;edition. To impugn the authority of the three e&s;tates, or to attempt a diminu|tion of their power or dignity, was, by 1584, chap. 130, declared to be trea&s;on; and the pro&s;ecutor maintains an argument &s;u&s;tain|ed by your lord&s;hips on a former trial, that although the act is &s;u|per&s;eded by the introduction of the Engli&s;h &s;tatutes re&s;pecting trea|&s;on, the offence that cea&s;es to be trea&s;onable, mu&s;t &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t as &s;e|dition at common law. My lord, let me explain the origin of this act, who&s;e very abrogation, it &s;eems, is productive of a new &s;pe|cies of &s;edition. It was obtained by James VI. to pre&s;erve the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tate, or rather the epi&s;copal power, in parliament, then in danger of being &s;ubverted by the efforts of our pre&s;byterian an|ce&s;tors. The dignity of the e&s;tates might be variou&s;ly impugned, by violence, by publications and &s;peeches, or by re&s;olutions in par|liament. A variety of inferior offences, or of actions in them&s;elves indifferent, were therefore converted by this act into trea&s;on. But the&s;e offences, when the act was aboli&s;hed, were again re&s;tored to their primitive &s;tate. Popular commotions directed again&s;t an e|&s;tate of parliament, would return as formerly to real &s;edition; &s;peeches, or publications, derogatory to either of the three e&s;tates, to their original &s;ituation as verbal &s;edition. By the act immediately preceeding this &s;tatute, to decline the authority of the coun&s;el was trea&s;on, but how ab&s;urd to maintain, that becau&s;e the act is aboli&s;h|ed, the offence, originally a contempt of court, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts at common law as a &s;pecies of real, and atrocious &s;edition? I conclude, there|fore, that the various offences comprehended i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this act, mu&s;t re|vert to their original &s;ituation at common law, like him who&s;e pa|tent of nobility is forfeited, and who&s;e de&s;cendants return to the common herd of mankind.</P>
<P>But, my lord, I do not like this act, nor its introduction in this trial. And I will tell you why. The Earl of Arguyle was ar|raigned on this &s;tatute, and convicted of trea&s;on becau&s;e he be&s;tow|ed an explanation of his own on a religious te&s;t, pre&s;cribed by par|liament, who&s;e authority he thus invaded, and who&s;e power he impugned. But this conviction di&s;honoured the ju&s;tice of the na|tion, and the act it&s;elf, in&s;tead of being &s;uper&s;eded by the Engli&s;h law, was abrogated previou&s;ly by our Claim of Right, or rather declared to have been an ob&s;olete and dead &s;tatute at the very time he wa tried. The Claim of Rights declare, that James VII. had forfeited his right to the crown, among other things, <Q>by cau&s;ing pur&s;ue, and for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ault &s;everal per&s;ons upon &s;tretches of old and ob|&s;olete
<PB N="74" REF="027591_0074_0FD54C2BA4AE2300">
laws, upon frivolous and weak pretences, upon lame and defective probation, as particularly the late Earl of Arguyle, to the &s;candal and reproach of the ju&s;tice of the nation.</Q> Thus the Earl of Arguyle, to the reproach of ju&s;tice, was condemned on the &s;tretch of an ob&s;olete law. But in this enlightened period, the gen|tleman at the bar, more unfortunate even than the Earl of Arguyle, is to be convicted of a crime that has &s;urvived this old and ob&s;olete act; an unknown &s;edition that &s;prings like a phenix from the em|bers of trea&s;on. Arguyle was convicted, becau&s;e he impugned an exi&s;ting law, but my client is arraigned, becau&s;e be impugns an act who&s;e exi&s;tence as yet is entirely potential. But, my lord, the offences accumulated on the Briti&s;h Convention, mu&s;t return to that &s;ituation which they held before this ob&s;olete &s;tatute was en|acted; commotions to real, publications and &s;peeches to verbal &s;e|dition.</P>
<P>Not to exhau&s;t your lord&s;hips patience, I &s;hall ob&s;erve of the &s;peech that &s;ucceeds this re&s;olution, and of the convention of e|mergency, that the fir&s;t, by enumerating the re&s;traints impo&s;ed by a Convention Bill on the right of petitioning, coincides exactly with the interpretation be&s;towed on the preceding re&s;olution; that the convention, by con&s;titutional means, would endeavour to pre|vent the introduction of a law to intercept their petitions, and to fru&s;trate the ultimate attainment of their objects. As to the other, it was natural for the convention, in the event of their di&s;per&s;ion in one country, (which, as their objects were con&s;titutional they mu&s;t have con&s;idered as illegal,) to provide &s;ecretly and beforehand, for re-a&s;&s;embling in another, beyond the juri&s;diction of the &s;heriff by whom they were di&s;per&s;ed. School boys, when di&s;per&s;ed in one pari&s;h, will repair privately to the adjoining, where they may renew their bickerings without mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>But what is the amount of this, and of every other article con|tained in the indictment. Their French epithets, u&s;ed perhaps fooli&s;hly, their re&s;olutions, and their &s;peeches indicate, it is &s;aid a de&s;ign to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution or government. The Solicitor General undertakes to prove that a plan was formed to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution. Let me tell him, that his evidence will not, and cannot exceed the indictment, that <Q>the whole form and manner of their procedure, as well as the principles they avowed and propagated, clearly, and unequivocally demon&s;trate that their purpo&s;es were of the mo&s;t dangerous and de&s;tructive tendency, ho&s;tile to the peace and happine&s;s, and tending to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution of this realm.</Q> Their principles, and the tenor of their procedure is the only evidence from which a plan to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution is inferred. But if &s;uch a con&s;piracy were formed, if &s;uch a de&s;ign was entertained, it amounts to trea&s;on, and &s;hould be tried as &s;uch. But a charge of trea&s;on, let me tell your lord&s;hip, cannot, and dare not be maintained; not that a concerted de&s;ign to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution, is not an overt act tantamount to trea&s;on,
<PB N="75" REF="027591_0075_0FD54C589ECD19F0">
but becau&s;e there is no legal proof, nor any evidence whatever, to e&s;tabli&s;h that de&s;ign. The te&s;timony of two concurrent witne&s;&s;es, whether in trea&s;on or mi&s;pri&s;on of trea&s;on, is e&s;&s;ential to conviction; but here, I repeat it again, there is no witne&s;s&punc; and under the pre&s;ent indictment none can be adduced, to prove a con&s;piracy to &s;ubvert the &s;tate. Sedition therefore is charged to-day, and the crime is to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, not by legal evidence, not by the te&s;timony requi&s;ite in trea&s;on, but by inferences from re&s;olutions, by inuendos capriciou&s;ly attached to &s;peeches, either innocent in them&s;elves, or, if criminal, con&s;tituting a very different offence. A de&s;ign to &s;ubvert the con&s;ti|tution, if &s;u&s;ceptible of proof, would amount to trea&s;on. Speeches and re&s;olutions are puni&s;hable only as verbal &s;edition, But an inter|mediate crime, a con&s;tructive &s;pecies of &s;edition is created; and from &s;peeches amounting only in them&s;elves to lea&s;ing-making, a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w crime, incapable of proof, and unknown in law, is extorted by infer|ence. The tendency, which alone is criminal in the&s;e &s;peeches, is not &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of the jury; but the &s;uppo&s;ed mo|tive from which they originated, are to be converted by an arbitra|ry and capricious inference, an inference nece&s;&s;arily influenced by fear, prejudice, and pa&s;&s;ion, into con&s;tructive &s;edition. My lord, I affirm that this is &s;ubver&s;ive of all judicial procedure. Con&s;tructive trea&s;ons are now no more; but a crime again&s;t the &s;tate may &s;till, it &s;eems, be e&s;tabli&s;hed by con&s;truction, and that which con&s;titutes in it&s;elf an inferior offence, be rendered the evidence of this con&s;tructive crime. In the unju&s;t, and ever memorable trial of Algernon Sidney, inuendos from his writings compo&s;ed the chief evidence, but Sir John Hawles ju&s;tly remarks, that, <Q>as this indictment was an original in the particulars before mentioned, &s;o it was a &s;econd of an <HI>inuendo</HI> indictment of trea&s;on; <HI>Fitzbarris</HI> was the fir&s;t. The pro&s;ecutor again&s;t <HI>Car,</HI> as I remember, was an information, and judgment ar|re&s;ted after a verdict, becau&s;e it was by <HI>inuendo,</HI> of which no pre|cedent could be produced, and although in actions, for words it was not permitted, yet in criminal matters, being penal, it was re&s;ol|ved it ought not to be permitted, and certainly much le&s;s in trea|&s;on.</Q> In criminal matters, no inuendo is therefore admi&s;&s;ible, much le&s;s in trea&s;on. My lord, our own practice corre&s;ponds with this. Oliphant and others accu&s;ed of drinking the pretender's health in public, 'with an intention of abetting his claim to the crown,' were tried and convicted of verbal &s;edition. The tendency of their &s;peech|es to excite di&s;turbance con&s;tituted their &s;ole offence; but the trea|&s;onable intention inferred from their &s;peeches, of abetting the pre|tender's claim to the crown, was not then charged, as a con&s;tructive &s;pecies of real &s;edition.</P>
<P>My lord, an authority occurs on this &s;ubject, not u&s;ual in a Court of Ju&s;tice, yet &s;o oppo&s;ite, that I &s;hall quote it without he&s;itation. It is the Monthly Review for February, wherein a pamphlet is re|viewed, the compo&s;ition of a Mr. Playfair, a man whom I know not, but who exhorts the nation to wage an eternal war. Mr. Playfair
<PB N="76" REF="027591_0076_0FD7BEE44C70FB78">
a&s;&s;erts that <Q>it is only a matter of regret, that tho&s;e who undermine our government cannot be treated <HI>a la Francoi&s;e,</HI> &s;ince it is the French &s;y&s;tem that they have taken for their model.</Q> What &s;ay the reviewers to this humane propo&s;al? Their hone&s;t indignation breaks forth in a &s;tream of argument and eloquence: <Q>A powerful &s;tream of the milk of human kindne&s;s flows through this &s;entiment of regret that the guilotine cannot be &s;et to work in this country, on tho&s;e who do&mdash;what? Betray their country? No; for they are already liable to the penalties of trea&s;on, and to a death infi|nitely more painful than that which is produced by the guilotine. Who adhere to the king's enemies? No; for they are in the &s;ame predicament. Who by overt acts attempt to overturn our govern|ment? No; for that al&s;o is trea&s;on. <HI>Who&s;e</HI> heads then are tho&s;e which the national razor &s;hould &s;have in England, if the <HI>pious</HI> wi&s;h of Mr. Playfair could have effect? The heads of tho&s;e who <HI>undermine</HI> our government: an expre&s;&s;ion not known in our law, and of cour&s;e not to be found in the index of the criminal code.</Q></P>
<P>Had the&s;e reviewers directed their eyes to Scotland, they would have &s;een, that, <HI>to undermine the government,</HI> though, under that denomination, unknown in law, nor to be found in the index of our criminal code, is created by implication a crime again&s;t the &s;tate. They would &s;ee that the mo&s;t iniquitous attainders of former times, might have been converted into a capital, though inferior crime. Sidney and Strafford were both convicted, though at different periods, of con&s;tructive trea&s;on. But Sidney, though unju&s;tly attained, might have been condemned for &s;edition, on tho&s;e inuendos derived from his writings, which in trea&s;on were not admi&s;&s;ible as legal evidence. Strafford too, if his &s;entence was iniquitous, might have been legally convicted of con&s;tructive &s;edition; and if this crime has a legal exi&s;t|ence, the&s;e men might have peri&s;hed unlamented on the &s;caffold. Strafford was accu&s;ed, and on con&s;tructive evidence, of <HI>an endeavour to &s;ubvert the fundamental laws;</HI> a crime on which the &s;tatute of trea&s;ons was totally &s;ilent. Arbitrarily to introduce it into the fatal catalogue was, in it&s;elf, according to hi&s;torians, a &s;ubver&s;ion of all law. But wherein does this differ from the charge again&s;t my client of a de&s;ign to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution and government? Where has this law lain &s;o long concealed, that it now bur&s;ts forth to the de&s;truction of this innocent man? Where is the precedent for this unknown law, or the landmark by which he could di&s;cover its exi&s;t|ence? It is &s;ufficient for his protection, or for our &s;ecurity, that this new crime of &s;ubverting government is pro&s;ecuted, not as trea&s;on, but &s;edition? Or is this new law le&s;s a &s;nare to the unwary, be|cau&s;e the capital puni&s;hment attached to &s;edition, may be re&s;tricted by the humanity of Court, to whatever arbitrary puni&s;hment the Court may impo&s;e? Mu&s;t he &s;uffer for a crime that had no ex|i&s;tence before, by a law created for the occa&s;ion, that may bur&s;t at la&s;t on our own heads, and involve us in its ruins? My lord, let the &s;peeches, if criminal, be puni&s;hed as &s;uch; but let not a con&s;truct|ive
<PB N="77" REF="027591_0077_0FD7BF066D9C9320">
&s;pecies of guilt be deduced by inference from the&s;e &s;peeches, nor a crime e&s;tabli&s;hed that is unknown in law.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;peeches, if criminal, are comprehended, as my brother has already demon&s;trated, under the acts 1584, chap. 134, and 1585, chap. 10, on which I maintain, as my &s;econd propo&s;ition, that where the offence is provided for by &s;tatute, a &s;everer or a different pu|ni&s;hment cannot be inflicted at common law. To e&s;tabli&s;h this propo&s;ition will not require any long deduction. Nor would I conde&s;cend to an argument on a propo&s;ition almo&s;t intuitive, but for an opinion delivered on a former trial, that where the indict|ment is founded, and &s;edition charged, on the common law, the Court are precluded from re&s;orting to &s;tatutes. My lord, the com|mon law is a collection of u&s;ages, the origin of which is uncertain, but of which the exi&s;tence is pre&s;erved by tradition. The &s;tatute, is a &s;uperaddition to the common law; <HI>declaratory</HI> either of its meaning, or <HI>remedial</HI> of its imperfections. If declaratory, it a&s;cer|tains preci&s;ely what the common law is; nor can your lord&s;hip, in your interpretations of the common law, travel beyond the li|mits pre&s;cribed by &s;tatute. Again, if remedial, it either <HI>enlarges</HI> and &s;upplies the deficiencies, or corrects the luxuriance, by retrench|ing the &s;uperfluous exce&s;s of the common law. Remedial &s;tatutes are therefore again divided into the law of England, into &s;tatutes enlarging and re&s;training the common law. As an <HI>enlarging</HI> &s;tatute inflicts a greater penalty than was otherwi&s;e competent, the crime, as in &s;tealing from bleachfields, and other &s;tatutory thefts, may, from motives of humanity, be charged at common law, to the effect of inflicting the inferior puni&s;hment. Thus, in England, as a mi&s;|pri&s;ion is contained in every felony, it is held that the indictment may proceed on the le&s;&s;er offence. But a <HI>re&s;training</HI> &s;tatute limits the penalty formerly competent; nor can a &s;everer puni&s;hment be inflicted at common law, than that to which the re&s;training act has already reduced it. A different puni&s;hment cannot even be inflict|ed; for the judge, who&s;e hands are thus tied up, has no power to deviate from the &s;tatute. Otherwi&s;e the con&s;equences would be mo&s;t dangerous; the effect of the &s;tatute would be entirely fru&s;trated; the law would depend on the pa&s;&s;ions, the caprice, or the intere&s;t of the man who pro&s;ecutes, the puni&s;hment on the di&s;cretion of the judge who pronounces the &s;entence.</P>
<P>But the puni&s;hment, as regulated by 1703, chap. 4, is fining, impri&s;onment, or bani&s;hment, meaning thereby bani&s;hment forth of the realm alone. This is the third propo&s;ition, which I pro|po&s;ed to illu&s;trate. The argument maintained for the crown is this, that bani&s;hment by the mode of tran&s;portation is prohibited neither by the &s;pirit nor the letter of the act; that the &s;pirit, as expre&s;&s;ed in the preamble, meant only to abrogate confi&s;cation and capital pu|ni&s;hments, the letter to &s;pecify the mo&s;t u&s;ual arbitrary puni&s;h|ments as then under&s;tood; and it is a&s;ked with an air of tri|umph, who will &s;ay that, by bani&s;hment the Court was limited to
<PB N="78" REF="027591_0078_0FD7BF07EE71ADD0">
the inferior of two modes of puni&s;hment comprehended under that generic term?</P>
<P>My lord, the &s;tatute it&s;elf &s;hall refutes this argument. The preamble recites, that from their generality, and the various con|&s;tructions of which they are &s;u&s;ceptible, the laws again&s;t lea&s;ing-making, (which are previou&s;ly enumerated) as inferring death and confi&s;cation, may be of dangerous con&s;equences, and the enacting clau&s;e proceeds accordingly to abrogate the puni&s;hments of confi&s;|cation and death. So far the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pirit, and the letter are con&s;i&s;tent. But the enacting clau&s;e goes farther, not merely to &s;pe|cify the arbitrary puni&s;hments u&s;ually employed, but as a re&s;train|ing &s;tatute, to limit the&s;e to an alternative penalty, to bani&s;hment, or impri&s;onment, or a fine, or on the inability of the party to di&s;|charge a fine, to a corporal puni&s;hment mitigated, and expre&s;sly limited to the pre&s;ervation of life and limb. Your lord&s;hips will therefore ob&s;erve, that the &s;tatute extends farther than the &s;uppo&s;|ed &s;pirit a&s;cribed to the preamble. A fine may be inflicted, bani&s;h|ment may be inflicted, or impri&s;onment inflicted; but the&s;e penal|ties cannot be accumulated, nor corporal puni&s;hment &s;uperadded to bani&s;hment, or indeed inflicted, unle&s;s on the alternative of the par|ty being poor and unable to pay a fine. The &s;pirit therefore, a&s;|cribed to the preamble is contradicted by the letter of this re|&s;training &s;tatute, re&s;trictive even as to that alternative puni&s;h|ment with which it entru&s;ts your lord&s;hips. The que&s;tion there|fore is, what is the meaning of the term bani&s;hment in the act of Queen Anne?</P>
<P>And on this que&s;tion, the argument from the act 1609, &s;o fully illu&s;trated by my brother, is to me deci&s;ive. I hold, that the ba|ni&s;hment pre&s;cribed by that &s;tatute is from Scotland alone; as tran&s;|portation, a puni&s;hment unknown when it pa&s;&s;ed, was not then in the contemplation of the legi&s;lature. This &s;tatute is the la&s;t enu|merated in the act of Queen Anne, wherein the epithet bani&s;hment occurs but once. Were tran&s;portation therefore, as implied in that generic epithet, to be inflicted under the other acts again&s;t lea&s;ing-making, then, this ab&s;urdity would take place, that bani&s;hment, though employed but once, has a double &s;ignification in the act of Queen Anne. If applied to 1609, it imports no more than ex|clu&s;ion from Scotland; but when applied to the other &s;tatutes which the &s;ame acts enumerates, it implies not only a &s;eclu&s;ion from Scot|land, but bani&s;hment beyond &s;eas, tran&s;portation to the plantations, lo&s;s of liberty, and per&s;onal &s;ervitude. Corporal puni&s;hments are limited to the alternative of the party being unable to pay a fine: yet this greate&s;t and mo&s;t ignominious of corporal puni&s;hments is en|tru&s;ted to your lord&s;hips as a mode of bani&s;hment. But, my lord, were bani&s;hment, as employed in the act of Queen Anne, an expre&s;|&s;ion either di&s;putable or doubtful, its preci&s;e import is thus a&s;cer|tained. When the act 1609 was in the &s;pecial contemplation, and underwent the revi&s;ion of parliament, that &s;ignification which was
<PB N="79" REF="027591_0079_0FD54C5B9BAEEA00">
implied, or that puni&s;hment which was pre&s;cribed, in bani&s;hment, mu&s;t <HI>in dubio</HI> be pre&s;umed to have been affixed to the &s;ame word, when employed by parliament in the act of Queen Anne. If bani&s;h|ment, by the act 1609, be &s;imple exile, or exclu&s;ion from the realm, there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that it acquired the additional &s;en&s;e of tran&s;portation beyond &s;eas, when that &s;tatute was revi&s;ed by the act of Queen Anne.</P>
<P>To this argument, my lord, I have heard no an&s;wer, and I hold it deci&s;ive. But the act again&s;t wrongous impri&s;onment, and ano|ther of Charles II. inflicting bani&s;hment to the plantations on tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to depone again&s;t delinquents, have been prepo&s;terou&s;|ly quoted. The fir&s;t, by bani&s;hing to the plantations, demon&s;trates, the &s;olicitude of parliament to di&s;tingui&s;h tran&s;portation, a puni&s;h|ment recently introduced, from &s;imple bani&s;hment as under&s;tood at common law; in the other, an act again&s;t wrongous tran&s;portation, as well as wrongous impri&s;onment, the expre&s;&s;ion bani&s;hment is not once introduced.</P>
<P>But, my lord, if tran&s;portation, which I hold to be a puni&s;h|ment &s;uperadded to bani&s;hment, be a mode of bani&s;hment compre|hended under that generic term, if under a &s;tatute, &s;anctioned mere|ly by bani&s;hment, your lord&s;hips are intitled to inflict tran&s;porta|tion; then, under a &s;entence of your lord&s;hips inflicting bani&s;hment, tho&s;e to whom the execution of the laws is entru&s;ted, would be en|titled, equally with your lord&s;hips, to tran&s;port to the plantations the man whom your &s;entence has merely bani&s;hed. My lord, the con&s;equence follows inevitably from the argument, and my client, bani&s;hed to-day by your lord&s;hips, may be tran&s;ported to-morrow by the executive power.</P>
<P>But a ca&s;e from the records of the Privy Council has been quoted as deci&s;ive. Baillie, a few months after the act of Queen Anne, was convicted of lea&s;ing-making, and condemned by the Privy Council, to be bani&s;hed and tran&s;ported, placed in the pillory, and adjudged infamous. I mean not to impugn the authority of a court of law, when I a&s;&s;ert that this &s;entence was mo&s;t unju&s;t and illegal. The Privy Council was nece&s;&s;arily arbitrary, uniting the execu|tive power to its judicial authority. The trials in that court were without jury, and the &s;entence was pronounced when the party was withdrawn. But a more illegal &s;entence than the one propo&s;|ed to your lord&s;hips as a precedent, cannot be conceived. In eve|ry article it violates the act of Queen Anne. Bani&s;hment, or im|pri&s;onment, could only be inflicted alternatively, and corporal pu|ni&s;hment, in the particular alternative of the party being poor and unable to pay a fine! But a gentleman certainly not too poor to di&s;|charge his fine, is declared infamous, a puni&s;hment which the &s;ta|tute has not authorized, and condemned to the pillory, a corporal puni&s;hment replete with infamy. Tran&s;portation, infamy, and the pillory are all accumulated on his unhappy head; and as if to refute the plea that tran&s;portation was an alternative mode of bani&s;hment, he is fir&s;t bani&s;hed from the kingdom, and then ordained to be tran&s;|ported
<PB N="80" REF="027591_0080_0FD7BEE23AB9FB38">
to the plantations. But in&s;tead of the illegal &s;entence of a court aboli&s;hed as oppre&s;&s;ive and tyrannical, if your lord&s;hips re|gards the ju&s;t and lenient deci&s;ions of your predece&s;&s;ors, what is the conclu&s;ion? That the &s;pirit of the &s;tatute, as interpreted twelve years after its enactment, is mild and equitable, when offences not le&s;s heni|ous than tho&s;e in the indictment, committed too on the eve of rebel|lion, were &s;o mercifully puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>My lord, a reference has al&s;o been made to deci&s;ions recited on a former trial, to the effect of proving that in the&s;e ca&s;es, tran&s;porta|tion was the mode in which bani&s;hment, the generic puni&s;hment, re|ceived execution. I ob&s;erved that the &s;entences, as in the ca&s;e of Rankin&punc; were preci&s;ely to this effect: <Q>The court adjudge the pannel to <HI>be bani&s;hed forth</HI> of the realm, and ordain him to return to pri&s;on, and to be confined therein till occa&s;ion be had for his <HI>tran&s;|portation</HI> to the plantations.</Q> We are told that the la&s;t part of this &s;entence is an explanation, declaratory of the fir&s;t, and confine|ment, till an opportunity offer for tran&s;portation, as well as tran&s;|portation it&s;elf, is interpreted as the <HI>mode</HI> in which bani&s;hment forth of the realm mu&s;t receive execution. Now my lord, it appears to me that this inference is not logical; for bani&s;hment forth of one country, never can imply tran&s;portation to another. My explanation is this; tran&s;portation to the plantations, as inflicted in the latter part of the &s;entence, is &s;upplemental, not declaratory; an additional part of the &s;entence of bani&s;hment forth of the realm; not explanatory of its meaning, or of the mode in which it was to be carried into ex|ecution. The crimes thus puni&s;hed by tran&s;portation are immaterial: they were either capital, and mitigated to le&s;s than death, or offen|ces of which the puni&s;hment is arbitrary and without controul; for thus without the intervention of &s;tatute, tran&s;portation was fir&s;t in|troduced into our law.</P>
<P>With your lord&s;hips permi&s;&s;ion, there are yet two circum&s;tances to which I &s;hall advert; the motive or the expediency of the puni&s;h|ment which I deprecate, and its di&s;proportion to the offence. The motive hitherto uniformly a&s;&s;igned for tran&s;portation is, that there is no &s;ecurity, nor advantage to be obtained, by bani&s;hing acro&s;s the Tweed, tho&s;e who will &s;till di&s;&s;eminate their &s;edition in England. My lord, has England no laws for her own pre&s;ervation, that &s;he mu&s;t be indebted for protection to the &s;evere vigilence of a &s;i&s;ter kingdom? Is it requi&s;ite that the laws of Scotland &s;hould interpo&s;e to prevent the future repetition of crimes in England? Sedition in Scotland is &s;ufficiently repre&s;&s;ed by expul&s;ion from Scotland: but mu&s;t England be &s;ecured by your &s;entence, even from the apprehen|&s;ions of &s;imilar &s;edition? To prevent the future commi&s;&s;ion of crimes in England, you impo&s;e a puni&s;hment which, if the crimes were ac|tually committed, the laws of that country would not authorize, and could not inflict. It is the &s;pirit of true puni&s;hment to prevent the future, by exhibiting a corrective example of the pa&s;t; not by in|flicting the penalty previous to the apprehended crime. With us the offence as bailable does not amount to felony: in England it
<PB N="81" REF="027591_0081_0FD7BF09B20BB4E0">
could not be puni&s;hed with bani&s;hment. Why then inflict a puni&s;h|ment appropriated to felony, as preventive of a crime apprehended in England, a puni&s;hment which could not be inflicted in England, were the crime committed?</P>
<P>My lord, on this immen&s;e di&s;proportion between the puni&s;hment and the offence, let me &s;ugge&s;t a di&s;tinction which I am too much ex|hau&s;ted to illu&s;trate.&mdash;Clarendon was bani&s;hed, Barrington tran&s;|ported. Clarendon, when exiled by a vicious court and a venal monarch, lived abroad, to him&s;elf and to his country, to illu&s;trate the annals of Briti&s;h &s;tory. Bollinbroke, though expelled for trea|&s;on, lived to return, and in a corrupt age, to revive the flame of pa|trioti&s;m in every Engli&s;h brea&s;t. Atterbury, though in exile, and under di&s;countenance, clo&s;ed the honoured remainder of his life with dignity and in peace. But a man who&s;e offence is inferior, who&s;e abilities are equal, and his integrity, I am bold to &s;ay, &s;uperior to Bollinbroke's, who&s;e genius may di&s;tingui&s;h his name, and enrich the literature of his country, depends on your &s;entence&mdash;whether his future life &s;hall be lo&s;t to &s;ociety, him&s;elf doomed to a receptacle of vice and mi&s;ery, and tran&s;ported to a &s;hore from which apparently there is no return. From the &s;tate of his health I mu&s;t add, that a &s;entence of tran&s;portation is to him, in all human probability, a &s;en|tence of death.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Henderland.</HI> My lord, the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent con&s;ider|ation is not as to the guilt or the innocence of the pannel at the bar, but as to the relevancy of the libel; and, my lord, I &s;hall be very &s;hort in what I have to &s;ay. It is certainly nece&s;&s;ary to exa|mine every criminal libel that comes before us, for crimes may be charged in a different way; a charge may be relevantly laid in one indictment and not in another; and, my lord, in a crime of this kind, which relates to a &s;ociety, or convention, the views of which &s;ociety may change very much, and the views of the members may be very different, men mi&s;led by folly, or mi&s;guided by faction, may have gone into meetings, into conventions of this kind, not aware of the views which they might have; not aware of the con&s;equences which they might draw from it, may, at la&s;t, come to feel the hollow ground upon which they &s;tood, the dangerous footing that they were upon, and the con&s;equence of their guilt might be very various indeed; therefore it becomes me to examine this libel clo&s;ely.</P>
<P>My lord, the que&s;tion is, is it relevant or not? that is, do the facts charged in the minor propo&s;ition come up to the crime charg|ed in the major propo&s;ition; that is all my province, I have nothing more to do with it.</P>
<P>My lord, this libel charges the crime of &s;edition, and the gene|ral import of the minor propo&s;ition is, that this per&s;on has been guilty, in &s;o far, as he has been an active member in a &s;editious &s;ociety; a &s;ociety, or convention, that is charged in the libel to be &s;editious. With re&s;pect to the logical conclu&s;ion, there can|not
<PB N="82" REF="027591_0082_0FD54C33E838EFA0">
be a doubt; for, I think, this propo&s;ition may be fairly a&s;|&s;umed, that whoever is an active member of a &s;editious &s;ociety is guilty of &s;edition: by active, I mean concurring in tho&s;e mea|&s;ures which render and characterize that &s;ociety to be a &s;editious one; but I &s;hould not be &s;atisfied with an indictment laid in that way.</P>
<P>My lord, if an indictment was to charge murder in the major propo&s;ition, and in the minor propo&s;ition it was &s;aid to be, in&s;omuch as he murdered &s;uch a man upon &s;uch a day, no doubt the conclu|&s;ion would be logical; but I do not think it would be a fair one; becau&s;e it is the duty of the public pro&s;ecutor to &s;pecify the particu|lar circum&s;tances. If it &s;aid he was guilty of murder, in &s;o far as he murdered &s;uch a man, upon &s;uch a day, by running him through the body with a &s;word, of which he died in a few days after, that is a proper and a relevant libel. Suppo&s;e it were to &s;ay, in &s;o far as he thru&s;t &s;uch a per&s;on through the body with a &s;word upon &s;uch a day, of which wound he died, that would be a relevant libel; becau&s;e, although the term murder, or the felonious intent is not repeated, it is, and mu&s;t be the con&s;truction of law and common &s;en&s;e, unle&s;s he be able to &s;et up a defence again&s;t it, and e&s;tabli&s;h that it was done by accident, which, to be &s;ure, would be a relevant defence.</P>
<P>Now, my lord, the capital object in every indictment, is to con&s;ider the facts &s;pecified in the minor propo&s;ition, and how far they come up to the general charge in the major propo&s;ition. We have heard a great deal about &s;edition, real and verbal; di&s;tinctions which are ta|ken by &s;y&s;tematic writers for per&s;picuity and clearne&s;s, but the true way to judge of &s;edition is to take it from the object before you, that is the fair way; for I can conceive verbal &s;edition as criminal, as dan|gerous as any that can be committed by actions. Suppo&s;e a man to run into the &s;treets and call out <Q>To arms! to arms! kingly power is u&s;ele&s;s; it is cumber&s;ome, it ought to be laid a&s;ide. Parliament is venal and corrupt. Let us name a body of our own to a&s;&s;ume the power which they have improperly taken. Rou&s;e and a&s;&s;ert your rights.</Q> Why, my lord, it may be &s;aid this is but words; but &s;uppo&s;e he gets people to follow him, then, to be &s;ure, if they proceed to overt acts, it would be rebellion, it would be trea&s;on; but &s;uppo&s;e nobody follows him, is there no criminality? Is there no danger to &s;ociety? Is there no injury to government if &s;uch pro|ceedings are tolerated? Can any man doubt that this would be a &s;e|dition totally different from any thing that I can conceive with re&s;|pect to lea&s;ing-making?</P>
<P>My lord, I hold it perfectly clear, taking that &s;y&s;tematic di&s;tinction that authors a&s;&s;ume for their con&s;cience, that there is a &s;edition by words totally different and di&s;tinct in common &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on from lea&s;ing-making. My lord, in the &s;ame way the impugning the authority of parliament, or of any of the &s;tates, that is a crime that cannot be &s;uf|fered; as long as parliaments exi&s;t they mu&s;t be defended again&s;t it by
<PB N="83" REF="027591_0083_0FD54C5E9B5CD260">
the common principles of that government which they have a&s;&s;umed: it requires no &s;tatute, it requires no u&s;age, it follows from the nature of the thing, that the impugning of that authority is a crime, and is the crime of &s;edition; and I care not whether it be merely in words, or whether it be followed by actions.</P>
<P>My lord, I lay out of the que&s;tion the act 1584, which declared it to be puni&s;hed as trea&s;on; but I &s;ay it is part of the common law, and, as was well expre&s;&s;ed by the young gentleman who &s;poke on the part of the crown, mu&s;t be part of the common law of every &s;tate, of every &s;ociety, of every government that can exi&s;t in the world.</P>
<P>My lord, having &s;aid &s;o much the que&s;tion then is, whether there is any charge made again&s;t this &s;ociety (for I &s;hall fir&s;t &s;peak of the &s;ociety) that amounts to this crime, &s;etting at nought or impugning the authority of parliament? If there is, I am &s;orry to draw the con|clu&s;ion, but I mu&s;t draw it logically that this convention was a &s;edi|tious meeting; and if this pannel which is the &s;econd que&s;tion, &s;hall appear to have been active in bringing about any &s;uch re&s;olution, then I mu&s;t hold him to be guilty of &s;edition. Now, my lord, I will not run through the whole of the argument, which has been long, and which has been ably and well de&s;canted upon on both &s;ides; I will &s;ay particularly &s;o upon the part of the pannel; and, if it had not been on &s;o &s;erious an occa&s;ion, I &s;hould have had great plea&s;ure in hearing the&s;e gentlemen di&s;play that ingenuity, that ability, and that force of rea&s;oning which they have di&s;covered in this cau&s;e; but, my lords, it is one thing to admire, and another to approve. My lord, I &s;hould be glad it were in my power to give a fair con|&s;truction to that part of the indictment which I am now coming to. I think, if in the common &s;en&s;e of mankind it admitted of that con|&s;truction, I am bound to give it; but I mu&s;t explain according to the context, according to the nature and the plain &s;en&s;e of the object of the re&s;olution. Now, gentlemen, the re&s;olution that I allude to has been under our con&s;ideration before; you will take it in connection with the motion made by Mr. Callander, which is al&s;o recited in the indictment; and then comes this re&s;olution: <Q>That this convention con&s;idering the calamitous con&s;equences of any act of the legi&s;lature,</Q> plainly referring to the Convention Bill which pa&s;&s;ed in Ireland, <Q>which may tend to deprive the whole or any part of the people of their undoubted right to meet, either by them&s;elves or by delegation, to di&s;cu&s;s any matter relative to their common intere&s;t, whether of a public or a private nature, and holding the &s;ame to be totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the fir&s;t principles and &s;afety of &s;ociety, and al&s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of our known and acknowledged con&s;titutional liberties, do hereby declare before God and the world, that we &s;hall follow the whole&s;ome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which &s;hall militate again&s;t the con&s;titution of our country.</Q> My lord, with re&s;pect to the opinion which they may form of this Convention Bill, that is one thing, or that any body may form of it;
<PB N="84" REF="027591_0084_0FD7BF0AEDBB69A8">
but to declare, by a &s;olemn and deliberate re&s;olution, that they have determined to pay no regard to an act of the legi&s;lature, but holding in contempt the authority of that legi&s;lature, I can put no other con|&s;truction upon it; if the gentlemen of the jury can, they are at li|berty to do it. I am &s;orry I am obliged to anticipate what may be the effect of their deliberation, but there is no help for it; I mu&s;t give my own opinion in this ca&s;e upon the charges before me, and I cannot after all the attention that I have given it put any other con|&s;truction upon it, than that it was a &s;editious act, a &s;editious, deli|berate declaration, to be held up by them to all their adherents, that an act of the legi&s;lature of this kingdom was to be &s;et at nought.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, as to the particular activity of this pannel at the bar, you have his &s;peeches. It may be &s;aid that a &s;peech again&s;t the Con|vention Bill in Ireland is not &s;edition in this country, becau&s;e Ireland is a foreign country; but you are to take what he &s;ays, with re&s;pect to that bill, in connection with the re&s;olution which he means to &s;upport; and you are to take into your con&s;ideration what he &s;ays in another part of his &s;peech: <Q>When I &s;aw the calm, deliberate coun|tenances of all pre&s;ent, and the &s;olemn manner in which it was pa&s;&s;ed, I was convinced that it would not only be a re&s;olution of words, but a rule of action.</Q> This, at lea&s;t, to pu&s;h it no further, &s;hews his conduct and his activity in this re&s;olution, which I mu&s;t, in &s;ound con&s;truction of common &s;en&s;e, con&s;ider as &s;edition.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I will not run over the different proceedings of this convention;&mdash;they divided them&s;elves into &s;ections, departments, and &s;o on.&mdash;They al&s;o had &s;ittings, committees of organization, in&s;tructi|on, and finance; and, taking tho&s;e into con&s;ideration, I am at a lo&s;s to find out the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a form of governnment, if they only intended to petition parliament.</P>
<P>My lords, that re&s;olution is again&s;t the common law of the country, and it is expre&s;&s;ly again&s;t the &s;tatute 1584; and what &s;hews the differ|ence between that and lea&s;ing-making is this, that in the very &s;ame parliament, or the next, there is an act about lea&s;ing-making; and what occa&s;ion could there be for that act if they were not different the one from the other? I have heard it &s;aid by an honourable and inge|nious gentleman who has argued this ca&s;e, that this act was aboli&s;hed at the Revolution, becau&s;e the Earl of Arguyle's trial, which per|haps in part proceeded upon the&s;e acts, was &s;aid to proceed upon old and ob&s;olete laws. It does not proceed upon old and ob&s;olete laws. Now, gentlemen, you all &s;ee how far this was aboli&s;hed; one of the fir&s;t acts of the Convention Parliament is to make it high trea&s;on to impugn the authority of the Convention of E&s;tates; but do they &s;ay that this nece&s;&s;ary defence of the con&s;titution, which renders the im|pugning the authority of parliament a crime at common law was to be left out? No; they knew better. They knew that government mu&s;t be &s;upported; and had a convention met at that time, and told this convention of the e&s;tates, <Q>You have no power to make &s;uch a
<PB N="85" REF="027591_0085_0FD54C6022CDA330">
law, we will re&s;i&s;t your authority,</Q> they might have been tried, under that &s;tatute, for endeavouring to re&s;i&s;t their authority. And in Queen Anne's fir&s;t parliament, within four acts of the act 1703, of which we have heard &s;o much, is ju&s;t the &s;ame thing as was done in the convention parliament: <Q>Our &s;overaine lady, the queen's maje|&s;tie, with advice and con&s;ent of the e&s;tates of the kingdom pre&s;ent|ly a&s;&s;embled in parliament, enacts, &s;tatutes, and declares, that the meeting of parliament now convened," &amp;c. 'is a lawful and free meeting of parliament, for the ends therein mentioned. And far|der, in pur&s;uance of the fir&s;t act of the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of this parlia|ment, and without any derogation thereto, it is declared, that it &s;hall be high trea&s;on for any per&s;on to di&s;own, quarrel, or impugn the dignity of this pre&s;ent meeting of parliament, upon any pre|tence what&s;oever.' And in 1703, it is &s;till &s;tronger in the 'act ra|tifying the turning the meeting of the e&s;tates in the year 1689 in|to a parliament. Our &s;overaine lady, with advice and con&s;ent of the e&s;tates of parliament, ratifies, approves, and perpetually con|firms, the fir&s;t act of King William and Queen Marie's parliament, dated the 5th June 1689, entitled an act declaring the meeting of the e&s;tates to be a parliament, and of new enacts and declares, that the three e&s;tates then met together, the &s;aid 5th of June, 1689, con&s;i&s;ting of noblemen, barrons, and burrows, were a law|ful and free parliament: And it declared, that it &s;hall be high trea&s;on for any per&s;on to di&s;own, quarrel, or impugn the dignity and authority of the &s;aid parliament. And farder, the queen's ma|je&s;tie, with con&s;ent fore&s;aid, &s;tatutes and declares, that it &s;hall be high trea&s;on in any of the &s;ubjects of this kingdom to quarrel, im|pugn, or endeavour, by writing malicious and advi&s;ed &s;peaking, or other open act or deed, to alter or innovate the Claim of Right, or any article thereof.</Q> This is the very act immediately prece|ding that again&s;t lea&s;ing-makers; and when I &s;ee the&s;e principles of ju&s;t government prevail among our ance&s;tors, &s;hall I believe that the impugning the authority of parliament, the dignity of parliament, and its authority, &s;hould be puni&s;hed as &s;imple &s;edition? Why, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to believe it when I read this act.&mdash;It cannot fall under the lea&s;ing-making &s;tatutes; it is quite a different thing.&mdash;It is arranged in the law books under the head of trea&s;on, but &s;till it was &s;edition before, puni&s;hable from the nature of the thing at common law; and if it is not high trea&s;on in England, it remains &s;edition in Scotland, and puni&s;hable at common law as &s;uch.</P>
<P>I do not mean to enter into any argument upon the &s;ubject of tran&s;portation; but I have a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion in my own mind, from various parts of Sir George Mackenzie, that he does not &s;o much as mention the word tran&s;portation in all his book, though long after the practice of tran&s;portation had come in; and I do not &s;ay any thing upon this occa&s;ion that is not found. The crime here charged is not lea&s;ing-making, it is &s;edition, in the proper &s;en&s;e of the word, &s;edition at common law. I will not compare the con&s;ti|tution
<PB N="86" REF="027591_0086_0FD54C3726159688">
of this country to that of England, becau&s;e I am unacquainted with it. I am not &s;ufficiently acquainted with their manners, their genius, their temper; but if we are not entitled to puni&s;h, at com|mon law, the crime of &s;edition, I know not what we are entitled to puni&s;h. The crime may not apply to the pannel; he may be able to &s;tate a defence to take it off, or prove circum&s;tances that may &s;atisfy a jury. It is the province of the jury to judge of the intent, and every circum&s;tance relating to it; and it is my duty to declare, that it is my opinion, that this man ought to be committed to the know|ledge of an a&s;&s;ize.&mdash;I have examined this matter with great care, and with anxious care, that I might not do inju&s;tice to him on the one hand, and, on the other, that I might do my duty. Upon the whole, I think it was &s;uch an intention to re&s;i&s;t the legi&s;lature of the coun|try, and to bring its power in que&s;tion, that, in my opinion, I cannot but commit this libel to the knowledge of an a&s;&s;ize, in order for them to judge of its criminality; and I am &s;ure they will act with the &s;ame candor, and take the &s;ame pains that I have done.</P>
<P><HI>Lord E&s;kgrove.</HI> My lord, the &s;ubject of our con&s;ideration is not whether this pannel is guilty or not, but as no man, by the laws of this country, is put upon his trial before a jury, till the Court have given their opinion that the facts charged will make out the crime laid, it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to con&s;ider whether the facts charged in the minor propo&s;ition do, if proved, amount to the length of &s;hewing that this per&s;on, accu&s;ed, has committed the crime of &s;edition. My lord, I have no difficulty in giving my opinion, that the major propo&s;ition is relevantly laid.&mdash;It is u&s;ual and proper for the pro&s;ecutor to &s;et forth particularly the different facts, from which he infers the actual commi&s;&s;ion of a crime, or the intention with which the&s;e facts have been committed. It is here &s;tated, that there was a felonious &s;editious intention, and that &s;uch and &s;uch circum&s;tances occurred, from which that intention is infer|red. It is &s;tated, that there was an illegal a&s;&s;ociation and meeting, which a&s;&s;umed the name of <Q>The Briti&s;h Convention of the Dele|gates of the People, a&s;&s;ociated to obtain Univer&s;al Suffrage and An|nual Parliaments.'&mdash;And my lord, it &s;ays, that they 'did, in the whole form and manner of their procedure, as well as in the prin|ciples they avowed and propagated, clearly and unequivocally de|mon&s;trate, that their purpo&s;es were of the mo&s;t dangerous and de|&s;tructive tendency, ho&s;tile to the peace and happine&s;s, and tending to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution.</Q> That is undoubtedly a relevant charge, if the pro&s;ecutor can prove it. Then it goes on to &s;tate, that they imitated <Q>the Convention of France, the public avowed enemies of this country, with whom Great Britain then was, and &s;till is at war.</Q> My lord, I agree with what one gentleman &s;aid, that the u&s;e of French words and French terms in this manner, might at one time appear merely as &s;igns of folly, and at another it might appear to ad|mit of another con&s;truction; but if you attend to it you will ob&s;erve it is imitating a body of men with whom we are at war, and who
<PB N="87" REF="027591_0087_0FD7BEE9EDEA70B8">
have rendered them&s;elves objects of horror throughout all Europe. I would be glad to know what could be the meaning of having pri|mary a&s;&s;emblies, departments, and &s;o on, unle&s;s they meant to form a &s;ort of legi&s;lative body among them&s;elves; and to what end their deliberations were to be applied, we are to judge upon the &s;ub&s;equent facts in this indictment, and upon them alone; namely, the re&s;olu|tion which they took, and the plan which they were pur&s;uing, they were endeavouring to obtain univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual parlia|ments. My lord, as to univer&s;al &s;uffrage, &s;o far as I know, I never heard that it had obtained in the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, or that it can obtain without overthrowing the con&s;titution; and therefore, though it may be lawful to obtain a change, yet if it is a change of that &s;ort, it goes to &s;hew that it was not their intention to improve the con&s;ti|tution, but to &s;ubvert and overthrow it; for it is that which I never heard obtained in the con&s;titution at the happy aera of the Revolu|tion. My lord, they thought it nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould have a convention;&mdash;a pretty thing in this country&mdash;a convention; not a convention of men coming together merely, but they were the re|pre&s;entatives elected by others; and, my lord, this is thought &s;o im|portant a matter, that they are afraid of any thing happening to pre|vent their meetings, and therefore here follows, in this libel, a re|&s;olution, that if an act &s;hould pa&s;s to prevent meetings of conven|tions they were determined to re&s;i&s;t it. My lord, the libel &s;ets forth this re&s;olution:</P>
<P><Q>That this convention, con&s;idering the calamitous con&s;equences of any act of the legi&s;lature which may tend to deprive the whole, or any part of the people, of their undoubted right to meet, either by them&s;elves or by delegation, to di&s;cu&s;s any matter, relative to their common intere&s;t, whether of a public or private nature, and hold|ing the &s;ame to be totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the fir&s;t principles and &s;afety of &s;ociety, and al&s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of our known and acknowledg|ed con&s;titutional liberties, do hereby declare, before God and the world, that we &s;hall follow the whole&s;ome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which &s;hall militate again&s;t the con|&s;titution of our country; and &s;hall continue to a&s;&s;emble, and con&s;i|der of the be&s;t means by which we can accompli&s;h a real repre&s;en|tation of the people, and annual election, until compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force.</Q></P>
<P>Now, my lord, this determination, if words are plain, is a re&s;olu|tion not to di&s;obey a law already made, but to di&s;obey a law which they expected to pa&s;s when it &s;hould pa&s;s; and when there is any notice given of it, then there is to be a &s;ecret convention a&s;&s;embled; that &s;ecret convention to declare their &s;ittings permanent, after the manner of the French Convention, and they are to continue to &s;it till they are compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force. And, in the twelfth page of the libel, it is &s;tated that this pannel, at the end of a long &s;peech, immediately after this re&s;olution, told them, <Q>and though by &s;ome it may be thought a bold, by &s;ome a daring mea&s;ure, yet
<PB N="88" REF="027591_0088_0FD54C38625AB938">
it will be found the be&s;t for &s;ecuring the peace of our country; for, if &s;uch a law were &s;uffered to pa&s;s, if men were not allowed to utter their complaints, a number of fierce and rancorous pa&s;&s;ions would ari&s;e, and we would &s;eek to appeal to that la&s;t terrible de|ci&s;ion, the event of which is uncertain, but which God and nature allows.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If the &s;ervility of the people had been le&s;s; if they had dared to meet, and, in place of murmuring, to have told their rulers that there was danger in &s;eeking to deprive them of their liber|ties, we would not have to adopt this re&s;olution to-night; but, when I &s;aw the calm deliberate countenances of all pre&s;ent, and the &s;olemn manner in which it was pa&s;&s;ed. I was convinc|ed that it would not only be a re&s;olution of words, but a rule of action.</Q></P>
<P>My lord, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I can put but one con&s;truction up|on the&s;e words; that they meant to appeal to the terrible deci&s;ion of the &s;word. My lord, I &s;hall add no more upon the general rele|vancy of this charge; I am clearly of opinion that this is &s;edition, and &s;edition of the mo&s;t aggravated nature. My lord, much has been &s;aid of real &s;edition and verbal &s;edition; &s;ome gentlemen &s;eem to think that there can be no &s;uch thing as real &s;edition, for that it would amount to trea&s;on. But, my lord, &s;uppo&s;ing a man to have wrote a paper &s;aying, I propo&s;e you &s;hall meet in convention, and you &s;hall have primary a&s;&s;emblies, and &s;hall re&s;olve to re&s;i&s;t any law that may pa&s;s to di&s;per&s;e them, why, that would be exciting &s;edition; but here is a body of men actually met together, a combination and con&s;piracy of a hundred, or a hundred and fifty people, in the form of a convention of delegates, re&s;olving to re&s;i&s;t the government e|&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</P>
<P>My lord, I am clearly of opinion, that that &s;pecies of offence, call it &s;edition or what you will, I call it the greate&s;t of all &s;edition, would have been puni&s;hable by the acts of parliament already &s;po|ken to by my brother; and I have no doubt that this re&s;olution to oppo&s;e the authority of the legi&s;lature, to prevent them from making laws, or di&s;obeying tho&s;e laws when made, is a re&s;olution and a conduct that would have been puni&s;hable capitally in former times, and is puni&s;hable independent of all the acts regarding lea&s;|ing-making, or what I call calumny of the king and his mini&s;ters. But, my lord, it is not only this re&s;olution that I call &s;edition, but there is another thing, your lord&s;hip will ob&s;erve what is &s;aid in one of the &s;peeches of this gentleman, &s;et forth in this libel. <Q>Let us then endeavour to in&s;truct the people in their rights, and to in|form them of our views and our intentions.</Q> Your lord&s;hip &s;ees they were to in&s;truct the people, and teach them their principles, to inform the country of what their principles and doctrines were, &s;o that, if their principles were had, lea&s;ing making is a much inferior &s;pecies of offence than this.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="027591_0089_0FD7BEEB6E724DF8">In the la&s;t place, as to what your lord&s;hip may propo&s;e (if the li|bel be proven) as a puni&s;hment, your lord&s;hips have given your o|pinions on a former occa&s;ion, that there is no law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">ining o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from inflicting bani&s;hment by the mode of tran&s;portation. If I had had any difficulty before, I own, an authority quoted this day by Mr. Solicitor General would at once have done away every he&s;ita|tion upon the &s;ubject. Your lord&s;hip heard the authority of a judg|ment of the privy council, which was read upon a libel, laid upon this very act of parliament, and pronounced by judges who were &s;itting (no doubt mo&s;t of them) in parliament at the time that act was pa&s;&s;ed; and therefore, I think there can be no doubt that your lord&s;hips are authorized to &s;entence to bani&s;hment by tran&s;portation. One of the gentlemen &s;aid, that the act of 1703 made it an alter|native puni&s;hment, either bani&s;hment, fine, or impri&s;onment; but, my lord, the men who drank the pretender's health were condemn|ed to fine, to impri&s;onment, and al&s;o the di&s;qualifications of office, and therefore it was by no means confined to any one of them. I am of opinion, in this ca&s;e, that your lord&s;hip &s;hould find the libel relevant to infer the pains of law which is re&s;tricted to an arbitrary puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Swinton.</HI> My lord, the que&s;tion now under the con&s;ideration of this court is as to the relevancy of this libel. My lords, in the &s;hort time that I have &s;at here as judge, three of the&s;e ca&s;es have occurred; Muir, Skirving, and Margarot. In each of them I gave my opinion upon the relevancy, as al&s;o upon the puni&s;hment, and it is very di&s;agreeable to go over the &s;ame ground again, e&s;pe|cially when gentlemen of more abilities than my&s;elf have already done it; for that rea&s;on I &s;hall be exceedingly &s;hort, and only go to where I think the e&s;&s;ence of the crime lies.</P>
<P>My lord, the crime charged in the major propo&s;ition is, in ge|neral, &s;edition. The facts charged in the minor propo&s;ition a|mount, in my opinion, to this, to a charge of a &s;editious con&s;pi|racy to overturn the e&s;tabli&s;hed government, the happy govern|ment of this country, by force and outrage, if it cannot be done otherwi&s;e. I &s;ay it amounts to a &s;editious con&s;piracy to over|turn the con&s;titution by force and outrage, if it cannot be done o|therwi&s;e.</P>
<P>My lord, whether the&s;e facts are relevant to infer the pains of law, needs very little con&s;ideration. My lord, that it is a &s;edit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous con&s;piracy to overturn the con&s;titution, one need only read the aim and intention of this Briti&s;h Convention, as it is called, <Q>the Bri|ti&s;h Convention of Delegates of the People, a&s;&s;ociated to obtain Univer&s;al Suffrage and Annual Parliaments.</Q> The gentlemen who have appeared, and di&s;played &s;o much ability for the pannel, have taken a great deal of pains to fritter down what is meant by univer&s;al &s;uffrage. My lords, I maintain that it is not only incon|&s;i&s;tent with the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, but incon&s;i&s;tent with every
<PB N="90" REF="027591_0090_0FD7BF0CEA0E4BE0">
con&s;titution or government that ever did exi&s;t, or ever can exi&s;t, that every mortal who has arms, and legs, and head, (and we are all equal,&mdash;all of like pa&s;&s;ions and like judgments with one ano|ther, that every one of them &s;hall have equal &s;uffrage. In what? Not only in the election of legi&s;lators, but of magi&s;trates, of mini|&s;ters, and of judges too. Univer&s;al &s;uffrage, according to their meaning, is a &s;uffrage to rejudge what judges may do; al&s;o to judge whether they will obey an act of parliament or not, and whether the acts of the&s;e annual parliaments are agreeable to their mind or not. I will tell you what,&mdash;annual parliaments are incon&s;i&s;tent with any government at all; becau&s;e, if the&s;e parliaments &s;hould pa&s;s an act which the&s;e univer&s;al &s;uffragants di&s;liked, they have a right, from nature, to meet and &s;ay this is a wrong act&mdash;we did chu&s;e the&s;e people, but they have gone contrary to our univer&s;al &s;uffrage; and we have a right to rejudge them, and overturn what they have done. And I will give it you in the pri&s;oner's own words, if it be true as charged in the libel, in his &s;uppo&s;ed &s;peech. <Q>If you appoint a man to act as your agent, and make his &s;itua|tion &s;uch that he has every temptation to betray you, without in|curring the danger of being called to an account, the probability is, that he will &s;acrifice your intere&s;ts to his own. It is therefore that a free &s;uffrage of the people is what every man ought to de|&s;ire, as that alone can make the intere&s;t of the repre&s;entative and his con&s;tituents the &s;ame.'&mdash;Now, mark this, 'The great art of government, I apprehend, is this, that all &s;hould be governed by all.</Q> That is to &s;ay, that the whole of the &s;uffragants, the whole voters, &s;hall be governed by the whole voters.&mdash;What is this but &s;aying, that the mob &s;hall be governed by the mob, the multitude &s;hall be governed by the multitude?&mdash;Who would be cho&s;e a judge by &s;uch governors? Becau&s;e they would rejudge him.&mdash;There has been one in&s;tance in France, where the revolutionary tribunal and the jury, having found that the people were innocent, the&s;e &s;uffragants, the&s;e general voters thought the judges did wrong, and they judged them over again; and, if the account we have be true, every one of them were carried to the lamp-po&s;t. So the plan is, that there &s;hould be an appeal from the guillotine to the lamp-po&s;t; that is the plan of this univer&s;al government. He &s;ays, <Q>Were all mankind to a&s;&s;emble in public meetings, one of two things mu&s;t follow, either they will behave properly or improperly; if properly, their meetings will tend to do good, if improperly, it carries its own cure along with it. The people will &s;oon be brought into a better method by a &s;en&s;e of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, by which they will correct the errors into which they have fallen.</Q> That is to &s;ay, they would cut one another's throats, and the few that remained would &s;ee their folly. But, my lords, further, this motion of rejudging of every thing, and of the conduct of parliamant, is carried through the re&s;olution which they came to, before God and the world, that if there &s;hould be any propo&s;ition
<PB N="91" REF="027591_0091_0FD54C649E052A58">
for bringing into parliament a Convention Bill they would re&s;i&s;t it. But, my lords, you need only to read the&s;e things; they do not need argument. I am therefore clearly of opinion that it is &s;edi|tion; not only tending to overturn the Briti&s;h government, but e|very government; and that it is mo&s;t &s;urely relevant to infer the pains of law.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Dun&s;innan.</HI> My lords, the con&s;ideration of this very point was &s;o lately before us, and the Court gave the &s;ame opinion which your lord&s;hips have now given, that I think it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay more, than that I think, in this ca&s;e, as I did in that, that this indictment contains matter relevant to infer the crime of &s;edition.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Abercrombie.</HI> My lords, the que&s;tion which has has been &s;o ably argued to-day is preci&s;ely the &s;ame that has been argued before your lord&s;hips in the former ca&s;es. And, my lord, in the fir&s;t place, I am now, as I was then, decidedly of opinion, that no good objec|tion, has been &s;tated to the relevancy of this indictment. In the &s;e|cond place, I am of opinion, that the objection to the puni&s;hment of tran&s;portation, founded upon the act 1703, has no good foundation; and I think &s;o for two rea&s;ons. In the fir&s;t place, that it does not apply to the crime charged again&s;t the pannel. The crime charged again&s;t him is &s;edition, and &s;edition of the mo&s;t aggravated nature. A man may be guilty of lea&s;ing-making without being guilty of &s;edi|tion; and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> he may be guilty of &s;edition without being guilty of lea&s;ing-making. In the next place, &s;uppo&s;ing that act to apply to this preci&s;e ca&s;e, I am of opinion that the &s;ole and whole purpo&s;e of that &s;tatute was to take away the puni&s;hment of death, leaving the power to inflict, according to the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, either &s;imple bani&s;hment forth of the realm, or bani&s;hment by tran&s;portation.</P>
<P>My lord, it was &s;aid that upon looking into dictionaries, it appeared that bani&s;hment did not extend to tran&s;portation. But, my lord, e|very body knows that the &s;ame word may mean one thing in com|mon language, and have a very different interpretation in a &s;tatute; for, to give an example, my lord, <HI>heir apparent,</HI> I believe, in the Engli&s;h language, &s;ignifies a per&s;on the olde&s;t &s;on of another during his father's life, as the Prince of Wales is heir apparent to the crown; but your lord&s;hip knows, that heir apparent in the &s;tatute law of Scotland has a very different interpretation; for by the law of Scot|land, a man is not heir apparent to his father till his father be in the grave, and he may po&s;&s;e&s;s his e&s;tate for half a century in the charac|ter of heir apparent; and many other in&s;tances might be given. E|ven if we look into John&s;on's Dictionary for the word tran&s;porta|tion, he &s;ays it is bani&s;hment for felony. Your lord&s;hip &s;ees, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> even if we were at liberty &s;trictly to adhere to the common forms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;peech, the argument would not hold good, I have not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> le&s;t doubt that your lord&s;hips have a power to bani&s;h by tran&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|tation.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="027591_0092_0FD7BF0DEDD52B68">My lords, the learned coun&s;el for the pannel, both of them con|cluded a very long and able argument, with a circum&s;tance which I own I heard with regret, becau&s;e I always regret any circum&s;tance which in my mind tends to aggravate the guilt of a per&s;on &s;tanding in the unfortunate &s;ituation of the pannel. Both the one and the other of his learned coun&s;el, in &s;peaking of the puni&s;hment of tran&s;|portation, &s;tated that his ca&s;e would be extremely hard, becau&s;e he was a gentleman, a man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed talents, qualities, and virtues which would be u&s;eful and ornamental to &s;ociety. My lord, I am very &s;orry that &s;uch a man &s;hould be in his &s;ituation, becau&s;e if he &s;hould be convicted it aggravates his crime highly. Had he been a man ignorant and uninformed, it might have been &s;ome apology for his offence; and though &s;uch a man when he tran&s;gre&s;&s;es again&s;t the laws of his country mu&s;t be puni&s;hed, yet it would have been a good rea&s;on for inflicting the milde&s;t puni&s;hment that we could con&s;i&s;tent|ly with our duty inflict; but, my lord, if &s;uch are the qualifications of the pannel now at your bar, &s;o much the deeper and more aggra|vated is his guilt; for, my lord, we all know from the highe&s;t autho|rity, that <HI>to whom much is given, of him much be required.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> My lords&punc; when the que&s;tion was before us this day week, the pannel applied for coun&s;el, and I was very happy to hear that it coincided entirely with the opinion of all your lord|&s;hips. My lords, I have attended with the greate&s;t attention to all the&s;e que&s;tions of &s;edition, from the fir&s;t of them down to the pre&s;ent day, and we heard &s;imilar que&s;tions upon the relevancy of Charles Sinclair's indictment di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with great abilities at the bar, and al&s;o fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the court; and I do own, although I hope I am al|ways open to conviction, in every que&s;tion that comes before me, whether civil or criminal; yet I &s;ay I do own, that from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t of the&s;e que&s;tions, I never, at any period, entertained two different &s;entiments. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t point, I am &s;ure that much le&s;s than what is laid in the minor propo&s;ition would &s;upport the crime charged in the major propo&s;ition; and with re&s;pect to the judgment your lord&s;hips have given, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that I am very clear we have full power to pronounce that &s;entence, and that we &s;hould not have done ju&s;tice to the country if we had pronounced a &s;maller puni&s;hment upon any of tho&s;e ca&s;es. I &s;hall therefore not add any more, but that I concur with your lord&s;hips in the opi|nion that the libel is relevant to infer the pains of law.</P>

<P><HI>Lord Henderland.</HI> My lord, the objection is, that he has prejudg|ed the principles upon which Mr. Gerrald is to be tried; that he &s;aid he would condemn every member of the Briti&s;h Convention; it is &s;tated in a loo&s;e way, it is not &s;tated that he &s;aid he would do &s;o whe|ther they were guilty or not; I cannot &s;ee that it is a relevant ob|jection; if he had &s;aid, he would condemn them whether they were guilty or not, it would have been a good objection, but at pre&s;ent it is too generally laid.</P>
<P><HI>Lord E&s;kgrove.</HI> If the allegation had been, that Mr. Creech had &s;aid he would convict Mr. Gerrald, right or wrong, the objection would be good; but if it was only in common conver&s;ation that he had &s;uch an opinion of the intentions of the Briti&s;h Convention, it is not a good objection.</P>

<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> Then my trial would be a matter of form merely, becau&s;e a juryman, by &s;aying out of doors that he would condemn e|very member of the Briti&s;h Convention, takes for granted that very principle which remains to be proved. If a juryman had aver&s;ed only that he would condemn all the di&s;turbers of the public peace, no doubt he would be well warranted in making that a&s;&s;ertion; but, he &s;ays he will condemn them, not becau&s;e they were di&s;turbers of the public peace, but becau&s;e they were members of a convention, the illegality of which yet remains to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. So that your lord&s;hip mu&s;t &s;ee that &s;uch a general declaration operates to the &s;ame conclu&s;ion, that he would condemn a man for that which may turn out to have been legal and con&s;titutional.</P>

<P>Q. Was he &s;ober and in his &s;en&s;es at the time?&mdash;A. He was.</P>
<P>Q. Look and &s;ee if that is it?</P>
<P>A. It is; it was emitted upon the 5th of December, and he found bail the &s;ame evening.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;ee him next day?</P>
<P>A. I did; on the evening of the next day I went to the meet|ing
<PB N="95" REF="027591_0095_0FD7BEED73A709A8">
of the Briti&s;h Convention, accompanied by the lord provo&s;t, &s;heriff-&s;ub&s;titute, and magi&s;trates, in Lady Law&s;on's yard; when we went in we found that whoever had been in the chair had left it. Mr. Gerrald was &s;tanding near the chair &s;peaking to the meet|ing. Mr. Margarot &s;aid, they were met upon a con&s;titutional bu&s;ine&s;s, to addre&s;s the king, or &s;omething to that purpo&s;e; and &s;omebody called out, that nothing could be done till the chair was full. Mr. Margarot was called to the chair, and took it. Mr. David&s;on then a&s;ked if that was the meeting calling them&s;elves the Briti&s;h Convention; they replied that they were; upon that he &s;aid, "if that is the ca&s;e, you mu&s;t di&s;mi&s;s; we are come here for that purpo&s;e." Then there was a call for Mr. Gerrald to go on, but Mr. David&s;on oppo&s;ed it, and took Mr. Margarot, who was in the chair, by the hand, and pulled him out, and then there was a call for Mr. Gerrald to take the chair, which he did, and Mr. David&s;on made u&s;e of the &s;ame means to induce him to leave the chair as he had done to Mr. Margarot, and he &s;ubmitted to the compul&s;ion; they con&s;idered it as &s;ufficient that he was de&s;ired to leave the chair and was taken by the hand. It was then &s;aid that it was u&s;ual, before di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the convention, that they &s;hould pray, which Mr. Gerrald did,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, No. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> and then left the chair; but before he left the chair, as well as at the beginning of the meeting, it was called out that they would remember that the meeting had voted them&s;elves permanent the night before.</P>
<P>Q. Does it con&s;i&s;t with your knowledge that on the evening prior to this, the convention were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the magi&s;trates?</P>
<P>A. I was informed &s;o.</P>
<P>Q. When Mr. Gerrald was brought for examination to the &s;he|riff-clerk's office, were there any papers brought?</P>
<P>A. Yes; when Lyon the me&s;&s;enger and other officers executed the warrant upon Mr. Margarot and Mr. Gerrald, they brought them to the office, with their papers.</P>
<P>Q. What became of tho&s;e papers?</P>
<P>A. After Mr. Gerrald and Mr. Margarot were examined, it was propo&s;ed that the trunk &s;hould be opened, but Mr. Margarot re|fu&s;ed to deliver up the key; the trunk was kept till next day, when a warrant was i&s;&s;ued to &s;end him to jail till he did deliver it up; he refu&s;ed &s;till to give it up, but finding there was a warrant i&s;&s;ued, he held it in his hand and &s;aid, if you chu&s;e to take it you may; he &s;tepped a&s;ide a little till it was opened, and when he re|turned he &s;aw the papers looked over, and tho&s;e that did not apply to the bu&s;ine&s;s in hand were given up to them again.</P>
<P>Q. Was it opened in your pre&s;ence?</P>
<P>A. Yes, and in the pre&s;ence of Mr. David&s;on, the &s;heriff-&s;ub|&s;titute.</P>
<P>Q. Look at that paper.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="027591_0096_0FD7BEEE714A7C08">A. It is the inventory of the papers found in the trunk.</P>
<P>Q. Were all the papers that were inventoried marked?&mdash;A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Would you know them again?&mdash;A. Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> Look them over carefully by the inven|tory, and &s;ee if the&s;e are the papers &s;o inventoried&mdash;are they mark|ed with your initials?&mdash;Yes.</P>
<P><HI>(The witne&s;s then examined the papers, and compared them with the inventory of the papers found in Mr. Margarot's trunk.)</HI></P>
<P><HI>Witne&s;s.</HI> The fir&s;t &s;even articles were claimed by Mr. Gerrald, and the others by Mr. Margarot.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Montgomery.</HI> Were any other papers brought to the &s;heriff-clerk's office?</P>
<P>A. Yes; when the warrant was executed again&s;t this gentle|man, one was executed again&s;t Mr. Sinclair al&s;o, at the Black Bull, who was very much indi&s;po&s;ed at the time, and his papers remain|ed at the office, till he was in a &s;ituation to come to be examined.</P>
<P>Q. Were you pre&s;ent when his papers were inventoried?</P>
<P>A. I was.</P>

<P>Q Had he an opportunity of peru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng it?</P>
<P>A. It was read over to him.</P>
<P>Q. Did he object to any of the articles being put into it?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. Look at that.</P>
<P>A. That is the inventory of Mr. Sinclair's papers,</P>
<P><HI>(The Witne&s;s examined the papers, and compared them with the in|ventory.)</HI></P>
<P>Q. Do you know that there was a warrant i&s;&s;ued to apprehend Mr. Skirving?&mdash;A. Yes, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Q. Were any papers of his found?</P>
<P>A. Yes, the warrant was executed by Lyon the me&s;&s;enger, ac|companied by Fra&s;er, Mack, and Dingwall.</P>
<P>Q. Were you pre&s;ent when the inventory of tho&s;e papers was made up?&mdash; A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Who brought them to the &s;heriff-clerk's office?</P>
<P>A. The officers brought Mr. Skirving, with the papers in a bag, Mr. Dingwall put his &s;eal upon them, and Mr. Skirving al&s;o, and they remained &s;ealed up in that bag till they were taken out before the &s;heriff.</P>
<P>Q. Were they taken out in his pre&s;ence?&mdash;A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Are they marked with your initials?</P>
<P>A. Yes, they are; this is the inventory of them.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Clerk.</HI> My lord, I under&s;tand that the convention was not e&s;tabli&s;hed under the denomination of the <HI>Briti&s;h Convention,</HI> till 19th November, 1793. Now, one and all of the&s;e papers, as I un|der&s;tand then, that Mr. Scott is going to prove, are of dates ante|rior to the exi&s;tence of the Briti&s;h Convention, private papers of Mr. Skirving's, which cannot affect this cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="027591_0097_0FD54C691D41EDE0"><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> If the&s;e papers were produced for the pur|po&s;e of rearing up a charge of guilt, founded upon the&s;e papers, the objection would be good, becau&s;e he is only charged with &s;edition in the convention; but that is not the purpo&s;e for which they are pro|duced; they are produced as papers not con&s;tituting guilt of them|&s;elves, but as circum&s;tances of evidence, which, though I think they are not deci&s;ive ones, ought to be laid before the jury.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Are they libelled upon?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> They are all libelled upon.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> You know you are entitled to prove every fact and circum&s;tance that may e&s;tabli&s;h the pannel's guilt, as being art and part in the crime.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> It is very po&s;&s;ible that the pannel may find &s;omething among them that may be u&s;eful to him&s;elf; I don't know whether he will or not; there are nine tenths of them that I &s;hall not &s;ay a word about.</P>

<P><HI>William Scott</HI> cro&s;s examined by <HI>Mr. Clerk.</HI></P>
<P>Q. When did you fir&s;t &s;ee Mr. Sinclair's papers?</P>
<P>A. On the morning of the 5th of December they were brought to the office, with Mr. Margarot's, and Mr. Gerrald's, but as Mr. Sinclair could not be brought to the office at that time, his papers were not opened till about the 7th or 8th, when he was able to come.</P>
<P>Q. How were the papers &s;ecured when you fir&s;t &s;aw them?</P>
<P>A. Wrapped loo&s;ely in a towel.</P>
<P>Q. Were they &s;ealed?&mdash;A. No.</P>
<P>Q. In who&s;e hands did they remain from the 5th to 7th.</P>
<P>A. They remained in the &s;heriff clerk's chamber, in a locked room.</P>
<P>Q. You &s;aid they were inventoried in the pre&s;ence of Mr. Sinclair&punc;</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Did he offer any prote&s;t upon that occa&s;ion?</P>
<P>A. I cannot recollect.</P>
<P>Q. Try and recollect.</P>
<P>A. I know he declined an&s;wering que&s;tions.</P>
<P>Q. Did he offer to take a prote&s;t that the&s;e were not his papers?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect it.</P>
<P>Q. You don't recollect the circum&s;tance of a prote&s;t at all?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. Who were pre&s;ent be&s;ides you?</P>
<P>A. Mr. David&s;on, Mack, and Lyon.</P>
<P>Q. I wi&s;h to a&s;k whether, when you went to this meeting, you &s;aw any &s;ign of violence, riot, or di&s;order?</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="027591_0098_0FD7BF0F6E0CE508">A. No. I &s;aw no confu&s;ion till the magi&s;trates came there, there was no appearance of a riot.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Sinclair's papers were opened by any per&s;on whatever, before he &s;aw them.</P>
<P>A. No, not that I know of&mdash; they were locked up and &s;ealed.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gillies.</HI> Does it con&s;i&s;t with your knowledge that a paper was given to Mr. Gerrald out of the bundle, previous to taking the inventory?</P>
<P>A. No, not previous to taking the inventory; among&s;t the papers there was one which he &s;aid was very material to him, and we thought in was of no con&s;equence, and therefore gave it up to him upon the 6th, and a receipt was given for it.</P>
<P><HI>Harry David&s;on</HI> &s;worn. Examined by <HI>Mr. Montgomery.</HI></P>
<P>Q. You are &s;heriff-&s;ub&s;titute of the county of Edinburgh.</P>
<P>A. I am.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know that a warrant was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t Mr. Gerrald.</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Was he brought before you in con&s;equence of that warrant?</P>
<P>A. He was.</P>
<P>Q. Look at that, is that the declaration that he emitted when he was brought before you?&mdash;A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Was it emitted freely and voluntarily?&mdash;A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Did he appear to be &s;ober and in his &s;en&s;es at the time?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Did you ob&s;erve upon what day that declaration was taken?</P>
<P>A. I think it was upon the 5th of December.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;ee Mr. Gerrald next day?</P>
<P>A. I did, in the evening, at a meeting of the Briti&s;h Convention, in a wright's &s;hop, in Lady law&s;on's yard, at the &s;outh &s;ide of the town. I went there with the lord provo&s;t and &s;ome of the magi&s;|trates, with a number of peace-officers; there was a very great crowd, the &s;hop &s;has quite filled when I went in; Mr. Gerrald was &s;peaking; I &s;aw a number of people whom I had &s;een the night be|fore, particularly Mr. Margarot, and Mr. Gerrald. I a&s;ked if that was the Briti&s;h convention? I was told that it was. I told them I was the &s;heriff-&s;ub&s;titute of the county; upon that Mr. Gerrald went on &s;peaking. I begged that I might be heard; that I was the &s;he|riff-&s;ub&s;titute of the county, and was come to di&s;per&s;e the meeting. I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf principally to Mr. Margarot, as he &s;eemed to be the chief per&s;on there; I told him I con&s;idered the meeting as an illegal meeting, and I ordered the people to di&s;per&s;e; &s;ome conver|&s;ation en&s;ued upon that, and he told me they were a peaceable and con&s;titutional meeting; that if I would hear what was then going on, I &s;hould be &s;atisfied that they were what he &s;aid they were, and that they were then meeting upon a petition to parliament; and he &s;hewed me a paper, laying upon the table, with the words <Q>petition to parliament</Q> written upon it. I told them that I came for
<PB N="99" REF="027591_0099_0FD54C6B5D21C380">
the purpo&s;e of di&s;per&s;ing them, and that I was determined to remain there till they were di&s;per&s;ed; finding that I was determined to di&s;|per&s;e them, Mr. Margarot, with the approbation of the meeting, took the chair, and &s;aid they &s;hould not di&s;&s;olve till force was u&s;ed. I told them I hope force would not be nece&s;&s;ary; that I had force with me, but &s;hould be &s;orry to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing it. He &s;aid &s;ome mark of force was nece&s;&s;ary to be u&s;ed; upon which I took him by the hand, and de&s;ired him to come out of the chair: it was a friendly &s;hake of the hand, but he thought that was too &s;light; I then put my hand to his &s;houlder, and he came out; they &s;eemed to think that I had committed an a&s;&s;ault upon them, and threatened to pro&s;e|cute me; I laughed at them. Mr. Gerrald was then called to the chair, and I made u&s;e of the &s;ame kind of force with him; after that he made a prayer, which they &s;aid was the u&s;ual way of breaking up the a&s;&s;embly, and I certainly allow that &s;taid till I &s;aw them all out of the room; I then looked the door and took the key. Mr. Margarot &s;aid it was unnece&s;&s;ary to di&s;per&s;e them, for they had de|clared them&s;elves permanent. In an&s;wer to that I &s;aid it might be &s;o, but they certainly &s;hould not meet any where in the county; that if they did, they &s;hould be di&s;per&s;ed in the &s;ame way that they were that night.</P>
<P>Q. When Mr. Gerrald was brought before you, were there any papers brought with him?</P>
<P>A. Yes, Lyon, the me&s;&s;enger, who apprehended Mr. Margarot, Mr. Gerrald, and Mr. Sinclair, brought a number of papers in a locked trunk; which, he &s;aid, contained the papers of Mr. Marga|rot and Mr. Gerrald; they were not opened till the next day.</P>
<P>Q. Who had the key?</P>
<P>A. Mr. Margarot; he refu&s;ed to give it up till a warrant was i&s;|&s;ued to open it by force.</P>
<P>Q. Was is opened next day in your pre&s;ence?&mdash;A. It was.</P>
<P>Q. Was there an inventory made of them?&mdash;A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Was Mr. Margarot and Mr. Gerrald pre&s;ent;</P>
<P>A. They were both pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Q. Look at that paper?&mdash;A. This is the inventory.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;ign it?</P>
<P>A. Yes. Mr. Scott &s;elected tho&s;e which he thought any way nece&s;&s;ary or connected with the charge again&s;t him, and gave the re&s;t back; an inventory was made of tho&s;e that were retained, which is this in my hand. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ee the papers that belonged to Mr. Gerrald have not my initials.</P>
<P>Q. Were they marked by Mr. Scott?</P>
<P>A. Yes, they are marked both with Mr. Scott's and Lyon's initials; tho&s;e claimed by Mr. Margarot are marked with my ini|tials.</P>
<P>Q. Were there any papers &s;aid to have belonged to Mr. Sin|clair?</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="027591_0100_0FD54D05EFA697D8">A. Yes, &s;ome of them were given back to him, and &s;ome of them were retained.</P>

<P>A. Yes, it is marked with my initials.</P>
<P>Q. Was Mr. Sinclair pre&s;ent when they were &s;o marked?</P>
<P>A. Yes, he was</P>
<P>Q. Do you know of any papers of Mr. Skirving's being brought to the office?&mdash;A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Were they inventoried before you? A. Yes, they were.</P>
<P>Q. Look at that?</P>
<P>A. This is the inventory of them, and this is the &s;crall of the minutes of the convention which was found at Mr. Skirving's.</P>
<P>Q. Was Mr. Skirving pre&s;ent when that inventory was made up&punc;</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Clerk.</HI> My lords, &s;ome of the papers libelled upon are not here. In the inventory of papers there is one mentioned <Q>The rules, orders, and regulations of the meeting called the Briti&s;h Convention,</Q> which is wanting; for any thing I know that may be a very material piece of evidence to &s;hew what was the particu|lar nature of the convention, and with what particular views and for what particular purpo&s;es they met; and it is a very great de|fect in the evidence indeed, that the public pro&s;ecutor, after li|belling upon the&s;e writings and inventorying them, has not pro|duced &s;o material a paper as this. I was entitled to come here, tru&s;ting that this paper would be produced by the public pro&s;ecu|tor. I &s;ay that paper containing the rules, orders, and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulations of the Briti&s;h Convention, is a material paper, and he does not pro|duce it.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> The libel bears, that certain inventories are to be produced, and the papers mentioned in tho&s;e inventories, the gentleman might have known two or three days ago, what were to be produced, and what not; and it was incumbent upon him to have in&s;pected them; and, if any were wanting, to apply for a di|ligence to enforce their production.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> The public pro&s;ecutor libels upon &s;uch and &s;uch papers; it was your duty to &s;ee if tho&s;e papers were in the clerk's hands, and if they were not, you could have applied to the Court and got a diligence for the recovery of it.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> And this happens to be a printed paper of which they mu&s;t have one hundred copies in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Mr Laing.</HI> I don't know how we are to get a diligence when we did not know in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion it was.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Montgomery.</HI> Here it is, my lord, I have found it among the papers; here are eleven copies of it; in going over the papers Mr. Scott happened to mi&s;s it.</P>
<P><HI>Harry David&s;on</HI> cro&s;s examined by <HI>Mr. Clerk.</HI></P>
<P>Q. It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k whether you ob&s;erved any thing like &s;cenes of riot or tumult in the convention?</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="027591_0101_0FD7BF65AF6CF9D8">A. None at all.</P>
<P>Q. When did you fir&s;t &s;ee Mr. Sinclair's papers?</P>
<P>A. The me&s;&s;enger, Lyon, brought them along with the other pa|pers at the time Mr. Gerrald and Mr. Margarot were apprehend|ed, but Mr. Sinclair being unwell, and confined to his room, he was not, on that account, brought to the &s;heriff-clerk's office at that time.</P>
<P>Q. In what way were they brought to the office?</P>
<P>A. Tied up in a handkerchief. Lyon told me they were papers of Mr. Sinclair's, but I did not touch them. They were wrapped up and tied, but I did not ob&s;erve any &s;eal.</P>
<P>Q. I think you &s;aid they were inventoried in Mr. Sinclair's pre|&s;ence? A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Was you pre&s;ent? A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Did he &s;ign it? A. No.</P>
<P>Q. What did Mr. Sinclair &s;ay; did he deny tho&s;e papers to be his?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect that. I think he acknowledged that they were his? becau&s;e, when the papers were &s;elected, and part of them given back to him, he received them as his.</P>
<P>Q. Was any mention made by Mr. Sinclair of a prote&s;t?</P>
<P>A. I really do not know; one of the gentlemen did, but there were &s;o many of them that I cannot &s;ay whether it was Mr. Sin|clair or not.</P>
<P>Q. You are uncertain whether he took a prote&s;t or offered one?</P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;ay. I don't think Mr. Gerrald made u&s;e of the word prote&s;t; either Mr. Sinclair, Mr. Skirving, or Mr. Margarot did, but I cannot &s;ay which.</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect that he gave any rea&s;on for not &s;igning the inventory?</P>
<P>A. He refu&s;ed to &s;ign it, becau&s;e he thought it was a wrong &s;tep, contrary to law.</P>
<P>Q. Did he &s;ay any thing more as a rea&s;on for not &s;igning it?</P>
<P>A. Upon my word I do not recollect. The &s;um of what he &s;aid was put down in his declaration.</P>
<P>Q. Can you &s;ay, from your own knowledge, that all proper and nece&s;&s;ary means were u&s;ed in order to prevent any other papers be|ing introduced into the bundle; or, on the other hand, to prevent any papers from being taken away from that bundle?</P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;ay that I had any particular acce&s;s to know the fact, for I did not &s;ee them till they were afterwards opened in my pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>Q. Were they &s;ealed up before they were opened?</P>
<P>A. I don't think his papers were &s;ealed.</P>
<P>Q. Is it not u&s;ual, in the&s;e ca&s;es, to &s;eal up the papers to prevent any from being taken away, and to prevent others from being put in? A. Yes.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="027591_0102_0FD5236B3286AD58">Q. How was it that it was omitted upon this occa&s;ion?</P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;ay; there was a great deal to do in the office; I was there from before nine in the morning, till between nine and ten at night; the papers were lodged by the me&s;&s;enger in the &s;he|riff-clerk's hands.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> You &s;ay they were opened in the pre&s;ence of Mr. Sinclair? A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Did he &s;ay there were any of the papers that were not his?</P>
<P>A. Mr. Gerrald, Mr. Margarot, and Mr. Sinclair, &s;taid in the &s;ame hou&s;e together; and I remember one or other of them &s;aying there was a paper that was not his, that it belonged to one of the other gentlemen.</P>
<P>Q. Did Mr. Sinclair acknowledge tho&s;e papers to be his?</P>
<P>A. When Mr. Scott &s;elected them, Mr. Sinclair &s;at by him, and what papers Mr. Scott did not think nece&s;&s;ary to retain, he gave back to Mr. Sinclair.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Dun&s;innan.</HI> Did Mr. Sinclair &s;ee and know that they were marked as his papers, and made no objection to them?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P><HI>One of the jury.</HI> What length of time might elap&s;e between the time that the papers were brought to the office, and the time when they were opened?</P>
<P>A. They were taken upon the Thur&s;day, and they were not o|pened till he was able to come for examination, which was on the Saturday forenoon.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, who brought tho&s;e papers; was it Lyon?</P>
<P>A. Lyon brought them into the office him&s;elf, in my pre&s;ence, and &s;aid they were Mr. Sinclair's papers.</P>
<P>Q. Did Mr. Sinclair take any concern in what was pa&s;&s;ing, as to the inventory?</P>
<P>A. Not any thing further than putting into his pocket tho&s;e that Mr. Scott returned to him.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Henderland.</HI> Do you know where they were kept from Thur&s;day to Saturday?</P>
<P>A. I do not of my own knowledge; but I think, when I a&s;ked Mr. Mack, he &s;aid they had been under h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s own lock and key.</P>

<P>A. I think he did not. In the fir&s;t place he declined to &s;ign his de|claration, becau&s;e he con&s;idered him&s;elf improperly brought before me, and I think he mentioned that as he had declined to &s;ign his declara|tion he &s;hould decline to &s;ign the inventory of cour&s;e.</P>

<P>Q. Did you execute a warrant again&s;t Mr. Gerrald and Mr. Margarot?</P>
<P>A. Yes; I went to the Black Bull to enquire for the&s;e gentlemen; the waiter acknowledged they were in the hou&s;e, but declined going with me to their rooms; he told me the number of their rooms, and the fir&s;t room I went to was Mr. Gerrald and Mr. Margarot's. I knocked at the door, and they de&s;ired me to come in, which I did. I told them I had a warrant to carry them before the &s;heriff; they were in bed; they got up immediately; I collected together the pa|pers that were in the room. Mr. Margarot propo&s;ed putting them in a trunk, and a&s;ked Mr. Gerrald if he would put his into it, he con&s;ented; they were all put in, and Mr. Margarot took the key into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. When he was coming away, &s;ays he, <Q>I don't give you the trunk, you may take it at your peril.</Q> I told him I was not &s;crupulous about that, and immediately gave the trunk to a chairman, to put it into a coach. I looked out Mr. Sinclair's papers likewi&s;e, and took them at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Q. Speak to Mr. Gerrald's and Mr. Margarot's papers fir&s;t.</P>
<P>A.

I went to Mr. Sinclair and told him; and then there came a me&s;&s;age that they wondered I was &s;o long, and then there came another me&s;|&s;age to let him remain at his lodging, which I did till between 9 and 10 o'clock at night.</P>
<P>Q. When was the trunk opened?</P>
<P>A. I think it was two days after.</P>
<P>Q. Was you pre&s;ent when it was opened? A. I was.</P>
<P>Q. Who had the key? A. Mr. Margarot.</P>
<P>Q. All the time? A. I know nothing to the contrary.</P>
<P>Q. Was there any inventory made up of the papers?</P>
<P>A. Yes, at the &s;heriff clerk's office; there was none made at their lodgings. When the trunk was to be opened, Mr. Margarot would not give up the key, and it was propo&s;ed to get a Smith to break it open, but it was delayed that day. The next day Mr. Margarot was brought before the &s;heriff-&s;ub&s;titute and Mr. Scott; he &s;aid he would not give it up, but held it in his hand, &s;o, <HI>(de&s;cribing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">)</HI>

<P>Q. Do you remember that &s;peech?</P>
<P>A. I think there was a conver&s;ation one evening with re&s;pect to
<PB N="111" REF="027591_0111_0FD7BF2BEDDF39A0">
the union, and to the be&s;t of my recollection he did &s;peak upon that occa&s;ion; I was there part of the time.</P>
<P>Q. Was you at that time in the practice of reading the Gazet|teer when publi&s;hed?&mdash;A. I u&s;ed to read part of them.</P>
<P>Q. Did you read that in which Mr. Gerrald's &s;peech appeared, of which you &s;ay you heard a part?</P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;ay but I might have &s;een it, but at this di&s;tance of time I can &s;ay very little about it. I make no doubt but I read it.</P>
<P>Q. Did you think that the account you &s;aw in the paper agreed with what you heard in the meeting?</P>
<P>A. My memory is not &s;o tenacious as to recollect a long &s;peech; I cannot be very po&s;itive.</P>
<P>Q. But in &s;ub&s;tance did it appear to you to be the &s;ame that was delivered by Mr. Gerrald.</P>
<P>A. All I can &s;ay is, that I am ready to give a candid an&s;wer to any thing that I know, but as to what may be read from a new&s;pa|per I cannot &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> The que&s;tion is, whether the account given in the Gazetteer agreed with what you heard in the conven|tion.</P>
<P>A. So far as I recollect I did not ob&s;erve any thing remarkably deficient in it.</P>
<P>Q. Look at that paper and read it?</P>
<P>A. With re&s;pect to new&s;papers, I hope the Court will allow me this, which I think is fair, that any que&s;tion that is put to me, or read to me, I &s;hall endeavour to give a fair an&s;wer, but as for read|ing it, I will not be concerned with it.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. An&s;truther.</HI> Was you pre&s;ent when a motion was made by Mr. Callander, to this purpo&s;e, <Q>that in ca&s;e the mini&s;ter, or any other member, bring into the Hou&s;e of Commons a motion for a Convention Bill, as pa&s;&s;ed in Ireland, for preventing the people from meeting according to their ju&s;t rights by the Revolution, the &s;ame motion &s;hall be noticed to the delegates of the re&s;pec|tive &s;ocieties, immediately to meet in convention to a&s;&s;ert their rights?</Q></P>
<P>A. To the be&s;t of my recollection, I heard a motion of Mr. Cal|lander's read one night to that purport.</P>
<P>Q. Was that motion made the &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion at a future meeting?</P>
<P>A. I don't recollect being pre&s;ent upon that bu&s;ine&s;s till it was taken up as a report returned from a committee.</P>
<P>Q. Who was it that read that report?</P>
<P>A. I think it was Mr. Sinclair.</P>
<P>Q. Did you read tho&s;e parts in which the minutes of this conven|tion were given an account of?&mdash;A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Was any re&s;olution adopted in the convention in con&s;equence of this report?</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="027591_0112_0FD54C73AA471AD8">A. So far as I recollect, the convention conver&s;ed upon the re|port a long time; and, if I remember right, they agreed, that in ca&s;e of a Convention Bill, &s;imilar to that which had pa&s;&s;ed in the parliament of Ireland being brought into the parliament of Eng|land, that that &s;hould be con&s;idered as a rea&s;on why they &s;hould hold a meeting, which was mentioned as a Meeting of Emergen|cy.</P>
<P>Q. Did you hear of any other ca&s;es in which they were to meet?</P>
<P>A. I think there were others in the report; but I am not able to &s;ay po&s;itively whether they were taken into the con&s;ideration of the convention.</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect any other ca&s;es?</P>
<P>A. I think one of them was a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the <HI>Habeas Corpus Act;</HI> and I think there was mention made of the landing of foreign troops, or a foreign inva&s;ion, I am not certain which.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Did you think they might not be both u&s;ed?</P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. An&s;truther.</HI> What troops did you &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e foreign troops were?</P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;ay; it might be the troops of any country, it was in a general &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;uppo&s;e they were to meet upon the landing of troops who were our allies though not Briti&s;h troops, for in&s;tance He&s;&s;ians and Hanoverians?</P>
<P>A. As to the intention of that, it is what I cannot enter into.</P>
<P>Q. Upon the oath you have now taken, did you hear that the convention were to meet upon the landing of He&s;&s;ians or Hanove|rians in this country?&mdash;A. I cannot recollect.</P>
<P>Q. You have mentioned three ca&s;es of emergency; was any mention made of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the act for preventing wrongous impri&s;onment?&mdash;A. I do not recollect.</P>
<P>Q. Where were they to meet?&mdash;A. I know not.</P>
<P>Q. Who was to fix the place of meeting?</P>
<P>A. To the be&s;t of my recollection there was a committee appoint|ed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Q. Were they to keep it in &s;ecret till it happened?</P>
<P>A. They were not to tell it; there was a confidential tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in a few that they were to fix the place and find ways and means.</P>
<P>Q. Was there any mention of &s;ealed letters being delivered to them fixing the place of meeting, which were not to be opened till delivered by the delegates to their con&s;tituents?</P>
<P>A. I think I heard a mention made of &s;ealed letters, but then I don't lay that that was the mode that was determined.</P>
<P>Q. What number was to proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s in ca&s;e of the&s;e e|vents happening?&mdash;A. I cannot be po&s;itive upon that &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="027591_0113_0FD7BF58EF7BF9B0">Q. Was this re&s;olution come to in a more &s;olemn manner than any other re&s;olutions in the convention?</P>
<P>A. So far as I recollect the convention deliberated upon it in a very decent, &s;erious manner; and at la&s;t, they re&s;olved it &s;tand|ing</P>
<P>Q. They all &s;tood up, to declare their purpo&s;e of carrying it in|to execution more &s;olemnly than u&s;ual?</P>
<P>A. We all &s;tood up; and I think we did &s;o upon another occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect what that other occa&s;ion was?</P>
<P>A. I rather have heard of it than was pre&s;ent at it.</P>
<P>Q. Was it at the propo&s;al for a union?</P>
<P>A. I was not pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Q. Or upon their changing the de&s;ignation of their meeting to that of the Briti&s;h Convention?&mdash;A. I was not pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Q. Did they, in pa&s;&s;ing this re&s;olution, declare before God and the world, that they would do &s;o and &s;o?</P>
<P>A. I recollect the expre&s;&s;ions before God and the world were made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>Q. Did you ever hear &s;uch &s;olemn expre&s;&s;ions made u&s;e of upon a|ny other occa&s;ions?&mdash;A. I do not recollect.</P>
<P>Q. Did the pannel make a &s;peech upon that occa&s;ion, after this re|&s;olution was &s;o &s;olemnly pa&s;&s;ed?</P>
<P>A. So far as I recollect, Mr. Gerrald did &s;peak, after the re&s;olu|tion.</P>
<P>Q. Did you pay attention to this &s;peech?&mdash;A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Did you afterwards read that &s;peech in the Gazetteer?</P>
<P>A. I do not doubt but I might in reading the Gazetteer.</P>
<P>Q. And did the account in the Gazetteer much differ from what you had heard?</P>
<P>A. I can &s;ay no more than I have already &s;aid, that I did not ob|&s;erve any thing remarkably erroneous in it.</P>
<P>Q. Was it a cool deliberate kind of &s;peech, or was it warm and a|nimated?</P>
<P>A. I don't recollect, but Mr. Gerrald &s;poke in his u&s;ual tone.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Cockburn</HI> cro&s;s examined by <HI>Mr. Clerk.</HI></P>
<P>Q. You &s;aid you was a member of the convention; what did you under&s;tand to be the purpo&s;es for which they met?</P>
<P>A. The purpo&s;es in general, for which the convention met, was a reform in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>Q. By what means did the convention intend to accompli&s;h this re|form?</P>
<P>A. The means, &s;o far as I under&s;tood, that they intended to u&s;e, was to endeavour to collect the minds of the people who were of the &s;ame opinion, and, by legal methods to obtain their object, in a peaceable manner, &s;o far as I under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Q. Were they to petition parliament?</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="027591_0114_0FD7BF5A6F3EBDE8">A. It was agreed upon in the convention as I under&s;tood in Oc|tober; but I was not pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Q. What did you under&s;tand to be the object of the Briti&s;h Con|vention which met in November?</P>
<P>A. I under&s;tood nothing e&s;&s;entially different from the convention that met before; the only difference was the acce&s;&s;ion of a num|ber of delegates from England; their de&s;ign I undert&s;tood to be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Q. You have been a&s;ked whether Mr. Gerrald made a &s;peech upon the 21&s;t of November; now I beg leave to read it over to you, and then tell me if you recollect Mr. Gerrald making &s;uch a &s;peech?</P>
<P>A. If there are any words that I recollect I &s;hall tell you.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Burnet.</HI> He has already &s;aid, that when he read the Gazet|teer there was nothing e&s;&s;entially different.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Clerk.</HI> He &s;aid, that he generally read the Gazetteer, and he perceived nothing remarkably deficient; he &s;poke generally. I have not yet heard the witne&s;s &s;ay that he heard Mr. Gerrald make this &s;peech which &s;eems to be principally founded on in the indictment; and therefore I conceive it nece&s;&s;ary that the fact &s;hould be a&s;certained, whether the witne&s;s heard that &s;peech, yea or not.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> I can certainly have no objection, except this, that the witne&s;s has been examined on the part of the pro&s;e|cutor, and has given all the an&s;wers that he can give.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> There is one ob&s;ervation, I &s;hall make to the gentlemen of the jury, that this witne&s;s has attended &s;everal meet|ings of the convention, and when he was there, Mr. Gerrald made &s;ome &s;peeches, although not &s;o many as &s;ome other people did; and he tells you he was induced to read the Gazetteer, at lea&s;t, &s;o far as related to the proceedings of the convention. The &s;peeches made to-night are publi&s;hed in the Gazetteer to-morrow, and I would a&s;k whether that witne&s;s's comparative view of the &s;peeches at that time, or &s;o long after, is mo&s;t likely to be right.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Fletcher.</HI> He &s;ays there was nothing <HI>remarkably erroneous:</HI> now that appears to me clearly to imply that there was <HI>&s;omething</HI> erroneous.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> It does no &s;uch thing.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Henderland.</HI> The way that I have taken it down is this, that he did not ob&s;erve any thing remarkably deficient or errone|ous in the &s;peeches in the Gazetteer; that he don't doubt but he may have read it in the Gazetteer, and did not recollect any ma|terial difference.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Fletcher.</HI> Your lord&s;hip will allow me to explain my mean|ing: the words are, that he ob&s;erved nothing remarkably erroneous; I &s;ubmit to your lord&s;hip, and to every man who hears me, if that does not imply that there was &s;omething erroneous; it may there|fore
<PB N="115" REF="027591_0115_0FD7BF5BEDD2C620">
happen that upon reading it over to the witne&s;s, he may &s;ay that tho&s;e parts charged as mo&s;t criminal are erroneous.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> I deny the conclu&s;ion Mr. Fletcher has drawn from his premi&s;es; the plain meaning is, that there was no remarka|ble difference.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gillies.</HI> It is certainly true, that his recollection mu&s;t have been more accurate then than at pre&s;ent; but this is equally true, that the witne&s;s, having ju&s;t heard the&s;e &s;peeches, would not read them with that attention that he might if he now read them: for my own &s;hare, in &s;uch circum&s;tances I &s;hould not have read it at all.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> I think the witne&s;s' own idea of the matter is very different: he &s;ays he read over the Gazetteer, and ob&s;erved no|thing remarkably deficient. What do your lord&s;hips &s;ay; &s;hall it be read, yea or nay?</P>
<P><HI>Lord Henderland.</HI> I don't &s;ee any particular rea&s;on why it &s;hould not be read.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> Let the witne&s;s read it him&s;elf?</P>
<P>A. No, I beg to be excu&s;ed; I think I &s;hould rememember it bet|ter by hearing it read than by reading it.</P>
<P><HI>(The Clerk of the Court then read the &s;peech from the Gazetteer.)</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Clerk.</HI> Do you recollect reading the &s;peech you have now heard in the Gazetteer?</P>
<P>A. I think, &s;o far as I recollect that it is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Q. Do you think it has mi&s;tated any thing that was delivered in the &s;peech?</P>
<P>A. I think in the cour&s;e of reading, I recollect <HI>a great many words inter&s;per&s;ed through this &s;peech</HI> that I recollect Mr. Gerrald &s;poke in the cour&s;e of a &s;peech one evening; but I <HI>do not mean to identify the whole &s;peech.</HI></P>
<P>Q. You mentioned a motion of Mr. Callender's when you was pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>A. I heard a motion made which I under&s;tood to be a motion of Mr. Callender's.</P>
<P>Q. It was read to you from the indictment, but I &s;hall read it to you again&mdash;"That in ca&s;e the mini&s;ter, &amp;c <HI>(reads the motion from the indictment)</HI> I think you &s;aid, to the be&s;t of your remembrance, this was the &s;ub&s;tance of the motion you heard?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> Now, is this nearly the &s;ub&s;tance, or do you recollect any great difference?</P>
<P>A. I recollect con&s;iderably le&s;s of that than I do of the other; the beginning of it I don't recollect at all.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Did you read the Gazetteer when it was fir&s;t publi&s;hed?</P>
<P>A. I was in the habit of reading the Gazetteer.</P>

<P><HI>Mr. Clerk.</HI> I ob&s;erve a great many &s;entences in this indictment, printed in italics; and I take notice of this, that the jury may be up|on their guard, and not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be mi&s;led by that means.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> It is very wrong, that there was any part of it printed in italics, and how it happened I don't know; but all I can &s;ay is, to de&s;ire the gentlemen of the jury to pay no regard to them.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander Aitche&s;on</HI> &s;worn.</P>

<P>Q. Was you a delegate?&mdash;A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Did not you give in a re&s;ignation?</P>
<P>A. Yes, I gave in my re&s;ignation, as I had not time to tend re|gularly, but it was not accepted, and I did therefore attend occa&s;ion|ally.</P>
<P>Q. What was the occa&s;ion of their meeting the &s;econd time?</P>
<P>A. Becau&s;e the delegates from England did not arrive in time enough, and therefore we were called together again upon their ar|rival.</P>
<P>Q. Who were tho&s;e delegates?</P>
<P>A. There were four or five of them: there was Citizen Margarot, Citizen Yorke, who I believe has &s;ince died abroad, Citizen Browne, Citizen Sinclair, and the pannel at the bar.</P>
<P>Q. When you fir&s;t met in October, and afterwards in November, by what de&s;ignation did you pa&s;s?</P>
<P>A. The Convention of Delegates.</P>

<P>Q. Was it not the practice of the Briti&s;h Convention, always on the &s;ub&s;equent day, to read over the minutes what pa&s;&s;ed the day before?</P>
<P>A. It was the general practice, but was &s;ometimes neglected.</P>
<P>Q. Were there ever any ob&s;ervations or remarks made?</P>
<P>A. Corrections were frequently &s;ugge&s;ted at the time, and other corrections were delayed till the committee &s;hould meet to correct the whole.</P>
<P>Q. From what you know of tho&s;e minutes, that you had occa|&s;ion to take down your&s;elf, do you think the account they gave was a fair and accurate account?</P>

<P>A. I do not recollect his being called to the chair, I rather think he was not.</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect, on any of the nights that you attended the Briti&s;h Convention, any propo&s;al having been made for a uni|on between the delegates of the two countries, England and Scot|land?</P>
<P>A. Some &s;uch propo&s;al I believe was made when I was ab&s;ent, but I think I heard of it.</P>

<P>A. Yes, I did.</P>
<P>Q. Did you hear any thing of a Committee of Union to be ap|pointed?</P>
<P>A. I heard that there was &s;uch a thing propo&s;ed.</P>

<P>A. I am not certain, but I rather think not.</P>
<P>Q. Was you pre&s;ent when the pannel made any &s;peech?</P>
<P>A. I was pre&s;ent when he made &s;everal; and I was told he had made many when I was ab&s;ent, which I regretted that I had not heard.</P>

<P>A. I do not recollect whether I was pre&s;ent at that time or not; I know that &s;uch a motion was made by Mr. Callander.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know if it was referred to a committee to make any amendments or alterations?&mdash;A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Was there any report?</P>
<P>A. Mr. Callander was very much enraged that his motion was not adopted preci&s;ely in his own words.</P>
<P>Q. By whom was the report given in? A. I cannot &s;ay.</P>
<P>Q. Look at that <HI>(Callender's motion in the minutes)?</HI></P>
<P>A. That is my hand-writing.</P>
<P>Q. That regards the motion we are now talking of?</P>
<P>A. Yes, it does.</P>
<P>Q. Look at that <HI>(Mr Sinclair's amendments),</HI> it &s;eems to have been in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and marked in your handwriting?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> That is one of the papers that was found in Sinclair's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Witne&s;s.</HI> It was handed to me as a&s;&s;i&s;tant &s;ecretary.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. An&s;truther.</HI> Was you pre&s;ent when this amended re&s;olu|tion was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and did you continue there during the even|ing?</P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;ay, I rather think not; for almo&s;t every evening I was obliged to go away upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of a re&s;pectable gen|tleman.</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect having been pre&s;ent at that convention, when there was any propo&s;al to burn a motion?</P>
<P>A. I think I recollect it.</P>
<P>Q. Whom was that motion made by?</P>
<P>A. Mr. Sinclair, I oppo&s;ed it, becau&s;e we had hitherto done every thing with openne&s;s and candor.</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect the nature of that motion that was propo&s;|ed to be burnt?</P>
<P>A. I think it related to the calling a convention of emergency.</P>
<P>Q. Had you any idea of the rea&s;on why he made &s;uch a propo|&s;al?</P>
<P>A. Owing to &s;ome arbitrary &s;tretches of power that had been threatened.</P>
<P>Q. Do you remember a motion made by Citizen Margarot of the followtng import, <Q>That a Secret Committee of Three and the Secretary be appointed,</Q> &amp;c. <HI>(Reads it from the indictment.)</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="027591_0120_0FD54C7A2C0633E0">
Was any re&s;olution adopted for carrying that into execution? Was there a committee appointed?</P>
<P>A. I believe there was a committee of three or four.</P>
<P>Q. By what name was it called?</P>
<P>A. A Committee of Emergency.</P>
<P>Q. In what ca&s;es was this committee to a&s;&s;emble the convention?</P>
<P>A. I believe one was in ca&s;e any illegal attempt &s;hould be made to di&s;per&s;e the convention. Another occa&s;ion was in ca&s;e of a fo|reign inva&s;ion; and I heard next day that another was, in ca&s;e the <HI>habeas corpus act</HI> happens to be &s;u&s;pended, or the act for preventing wrongous impri&s;onment. In any of the&s;e ca&s;es the convention of emergency were to meet.</P>
<P>Q. How was this convention of emergency to be a&s;&s;embled?</P>
<P>A. I know of no particular mode in which they were to be a&s;|&s;embled.</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect what number they were to con&s;i&s;t of?</P>
<P>A. There were ju&s;t three and the &s;ecretary appointed on this bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Q. You had no idea of the place where the convention were to meet?&mdash;A. No.</P>
<P>Q. That was kept &s;ecret?&mdash;A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. And this, to the be&s;t of your recollection, was the motion propo&s;ed to be burnt? A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. You &s;aid the rea&s;on of propo&s;ing that mea&s;ure was, that &s;ome arbitrary &s;tretches of power had been made?</P>
<P>A. No, they had not been made; they were only threatened.</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect how you generally de&s;ignated each other in the convention?</P>
<P>A. We addre&s;&s;ed each other in different modes, very often <HI>Sir,</HI> very often Mr. &s;uch a thing, frequently <HI>Citizen;</HI> and I recollect farther, that the per&s;on who introduced the word fellow-citizens among&s;t us, was a very re&s;pectable young nobleman, Lord Daer; and he u&s;ed it &s;ingly for a long time, like the man who walked near thirty years with an umbrella over his head, and nobody followed his example.</P>
<P>Q. When you were divided into &s;maller parties, what were they called?</P>
<P>A. They were fir&s;t called <HI>divi&s;ions,</HI> and then <HI>cla&s;&s;es,</HI> afterwards the word <HI>&s;ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ons,</HI> was adopted as preferable.</P>
<P>Q. Did you ever u&s;e the word <HI>&s;ittings?</HI></P>
<P>A. Yes; and I &s;uppo&s;e you call this a Sitting of the Court of Ju&s;ti|ciary.</P>
<P>Q. You had in your official capacity an opportunity of &s;eeing pa|pers given in; how were they dated?</P>
<P>A. Variou&s;ly, according to the fancy of the writer.</P>
<P>Q. Here is one dated from <HI>Liberty Court?</HI></P>
<P>A. Very good&punc; but, my lord, what objection have you to the word <HI>Liberty Court?</HI> Is the very <HI>name of liberty</HI> become unpopular?
<PB N="121" REF="027591_0121_0FD54CA302FE0978">
And here is another dated <HI>Liberty Stairs.</HI> Now, my lord, we have a number of new titles, and new &s;treets, both in Edinburgh and Leith. I have been in <HI>Merchant</HI> &s;treet, where I believe no merchant ever lived, and where I am &s;ure there is not a &s;ingle merchant's &s;hop; I have been in <HI>Quality</HI>-&s;treet, where not a per&s;on of quality re&s;ides; I have been in <HI>Princes</HI>-&s;treet, where a Prince never walked; I have been in <HI>Queen</HI>-&s;treet, where her mo&s;t gracious maje&s;ty never &s;et her foot. Be&s;ides the&s;e, we have <HI>St. George's</HI>-&s;treet, <HI>St. An|drew's</HI>-&s;treet, <HI>St. James's</HI>-&s;quare, <HI>St. Patrick</HI>-&s;treet,&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> What is all this idle harangue to the pur|po&s;e?</P>
<P>A. My lord, I mu&s;t &s;ay, it is exceedingly improper, (I beg pardon for &s;aying it,) to interrupt a man upon oath. It is &s;urpri&s;ing that the words <HI>liberty court</HI> &s;hould be found fault with, when we have &s;o many new &s;treets named after <HI>&s;aints,</HI> although the majority of their inhabitants, &s;o far from being &s;aints, are in reality of the fa&s;hionable religion, that is the <HI>French religion,</HI> as your lord&s;hip perhaps would call it, or in plain Engli&s;h, of no religion at all. It is certainly pro|per to give a court that had no name, the name of liberty; nothing &s;editious can be inferred from it, any more than any thing &s;uper|&s;titious can be drawn from the &s;treets named after the Roman Ca|tholic &s;aints.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> You are not come here to give di&s;&s;ertations either on one &s;ide or the other; you are to an&s;wer to facts, accord|ing to the be&s;t of your recollection, and according to the great oath you have taken, an&s;wer the facts that are a&s;ked of you?</P>
<P>A. My lord, I wi&s;h to pay all due re&s;pect to your lord&s;hip and this Court, but I con&s;ider my&s;elf as in the pre&s;ence not only of your lord|&s;hip, but al&s;o as in the pre&s;ence of the KING of KINGS and LORD of LORDS; and therefore, as bound by my oath, to &s;ay every thing that I can con&s;i&s;tently with truth, to exculpate this pannel, who I am &s;ure is an innocent man.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> Many things you have now &s;aid, will, in my opinion, tend to do more hurt than good to the pannel.</P>
<P><HI>Witne&s;s.</HI> Of that, the gentlemen of the jury will judge.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Mr Solicitor General, it is needle&s;s to put any more que&s;tions to this man.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> I &s;hall put no more, my lord.</P>

<P>A. I have read them, but I have very little time to read.</P>
<P>Q. Did there appear to you to be any thing &s;tated in the Gazet|teer that you did not hear in the convention?</P>
<P>A. If I had read them particularly over, I perhaps could have an|&s;wered to that.</P>

<P>A. No, they never did. I believe Mr. Gerrald never belonged to any of the &s;ections.</P>
<P>Q. How came you to put the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions?</P>
<P>A. There was no harm in that.</P>
<P>Q. Was it a fancy of your own?</P>
<P>A. It was, without any orders, ju&s;t a fancy of my own.</P>
<P>Q. Was any thing of that kind &s;tated in the minutes of the con|vention?</P>
<P>A. They were written by me before either the convention or the pannel could know any thing of them.</P>
<P>Q. Were they afterwards read over and approved of by the con|vention?</P>
<P>A. There were &s;everal members thought them very fooli&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> But they were read over and lodged with the &s;ecretary as official papers? A. Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gillies.</HI> Were the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>Vive la Convention</HI> and <HI>Ca Ira,</HI> read over to the convention, or only the report from the &s;ection?</P>

<P>Gentlemen of the jury, you are now about to exerci&s;e the mo&s;t important function that private per&s;ons can be called upon to ex|erci&s;e;&mdash;to determine with regard to the guilt or innocence of the unhappy per&s;on who &s;tands at this bar; and were the ca&s;e at all difficult, in proportion to its importance, I &s;hould con&s;ider your &s;ituation, gentlemen, to be at this moment of a very hazardous and a very delicate nature. But you are not, upon this occa&s;ion, o|bliged as jurymen &s;ometimes are, to wade through a difficult proof, through a variety of contradictory evidence, to balance depo&s;ition again&s;t depo&s;ition, and from a long train of circum&s;tances, with a trembling &s;tep, to inve&s;tigate where the truth lies. This, gentle|men, is a province which often falls to the lot of jurymen; and, to be &s;ure, calls for the utmo&s;t attention with which the human mind can be ve&s;ted. This is a ca&s;e which commonly happens, where tho&s;e who break the laws of their country tru&s;t to being able to con|ceal the offence of which they have been guilty for impunity, and of cour&s;e it mu&s;t require a difficult, a laborious inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the pre&s;ent ca&s;e is of a different kind; the offences charged again&s;t this pannel were of too public a nature; they tru&s;ted not to concealing the truth for impunity, but to circum&s;tances of fu|turity, by which they hoped to &s;et criminal ju&s;tice at defiance; but their hopes have been defeated, and I have this day to lay before you a proof &s;o complete as that which I &s;hall have the honour of &s;tating to you.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ke up more of your time than at fir&s;t might be imagined, becau&s;e the mo&s;t material part of the proof you have not yet heard; it lies not &s;o much in the pa|role evidence that has been given, as in the written evidence lying upon the table; and, before I enter upon the particular parts of the evence, I believe it will be proper to lay under your view a gene|ral
<PB N="129" REF="027591_0129_0FD54CA9DDCFAB08">
&s;tatement of the written evidence which has been adduced, and the manner in which it has been authenticated; doing it in this man|ner in the beginning of what I have to &s;ay, will &s;ave repetitions, and will &s;ave you the trouble of again and again recurring to the &s;ame matter.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the written evidence, upon which I chiefly rely, con|&s;i&s;ts, in the fir&s;t place, of the minutes of the convention, (call it &s;croll or what you plea&s;e) made up by the &s;ecretary of the convention, and by his a&s;&s;i&s;tants. I &s;ay, gentlemen, this important document, fortu|nately for the &s;ake of public ju&s;tice, has been recovered out of the hands of the &s;ecretary, and is now lying upon the table. Gentlemen, when it was &s;een that the audacity of the Briti&s;h Convention had come to &s;uch a height that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the magi&s;trates and officers of the law not to take mea&s;ures again&s;t them, one of the fir&s;t &s;teps re&s;olved upon was, to take proper mea&s;ures for getting hold of the written documents in Skirving's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and by tho&s;e proper mea|&s;ures, &s;o taken by the officers of the law, has this evidence been &s;e|cured, and now lies before you, completely authenticated. The au|thentication of it is perfectly complete; you have the evidence of the per&s;ons who &s;eized it in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Skirving; you have them traced to the &s;heriff-clerk's office, and there you have them invento|ried and &s;igned in the pre&s;ence of the parties; and therefore I &s;hall hold the&s;e minutes as completely authenticated, and &s;hall have occa|&s;ion to refer to them again and again in &s;upport of the charge I am to maintain.</P>
<P>You have, in the &s;econd place, the evidence of the papers recover|ed out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, partly of the pannel, and partly of his compa|nion Margarot, which were got by Lyon, and opened by the key out of Margarot's pocket, in the &s;heriff clerk's office, all which now lie upon the table completely authenticated.</P>
<P>In the third place, you have the writings found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sinclair, by Lyon the me&s;&s;enger, at the time he attended the execu|tion of the warrant, put into a napkin, and by him carried to the &s;he|riff-clerk's office, not inventoried that day, becau&s;e Sinclair was in|di&s;po&s;ed, but inventoried two days after; they are al&s;o completely authenticated. I am &s;ure, from the nature of the ca&s;e, it is impo&s;&s;i|ble any alteration could have been made, and among tho&s;e papers you will find &s;ome very important and very deci&s;ive documents of evi|dence indeed. And,</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place, if it may be called written evidence, there is the evidence ari&s;ing from tho&s;e numbers of the Gazetteer which are al&s;o produced. It is very true, that in general, accounts given in a new&s;|paper cannot be received before a jury; but you will ob&s;erve, this is a new&s;paper in a very particular &s;ituation, publi&s;hed by a member of the convention who is now under &s;entence of fugitation on that ac|count, and recognized by the convention it&s;elf. Gentlemen, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to point out to you in what way this was recognized by
<PB N="130" REF="027591_0130_0FD54C811C8E4D80">
the convention, as giving a fair account of their proceedings. I &s;ee there appears in the minutes many re&s;olutions about &s;upporting the Gazetteer, as a paper of their party; and, in one of the minutes, a per&s;on of the name of Colin Nory having applied for a copy of the minutes, the an&s;wer returned to him is this, that it will be unnece&s;|&s;ary, becau&s;e they will find them in the Gazetteer. I &s;ay then, you cannot have a doubt but that it contains as fair and accurate account as you can expect; at lea&s;t accurate enough for all the purpo&s;es for which I &s;hall read them.</P>
<P>Now, gentlemen having thus &s;tated and given you &s;ome account of the evidence which I have to rely upon, I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider the charge brought again&s;t this pannel, and the evidence by which I &s;ay every part of it is mo&s;t completely and without con|tradiction &s;ub&s;tantiated. The general amount of the charge comes to this, that in the months of November and December la&s;t, a &s;et of &s;editious per&s;ons a&s;&s;embled in this city, and a&s;&s;umed to them|&s;elves the name of <Q>the Briti&s;h Convention of the Delegates of the People, a&s;&s;ociated to obtain Univer&s;al Suffrage and Annual Parliaments.</Q> That &s;uch a meeting was held in this city is a fact too notorious and too well remembered by every one of us to admit of contradiction; that this pannel was a con&s;tituent member of this meeting is equally clear and indi&s;putable, having come here by delegation from one of the &s;ocieties in London, I believe the corre&s;ponding &s;ociety; but it matters not which, and that he attend|ed and took an active part in the re&s;olutions of tho&s;e meetings will not be di&s;puted by him&s;elf. I believe that he took an active part, and I mu&s;t &s;ay, that from the talents which this gentleman has &s;hewn, and from the character given him by his coun&s;el, I have no doubt that his abilities and education qualified him to take a ve|ry di&s;tingui&s;hed part in the convention, as one of the leaders and prime movers among them.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;ay, if nothing more had been proved again&s;t this pannel than his taking an active part in the proceedings of a meeting of this kind, upon that I would maintain that he is guilty of &s;e|dition; becau&s;e I &s;ay the meeting it&s;elf, from the very nature of it, and the part he took in it, is &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a charge of &s;e|dition again&s;t him. For what was this meeting? What is the name that they a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves? They call them&s;elves <Q>the Briti&s;h Convention of the Delegates of the People;</Q> plainly con|veying an idea that they were the repre&s;entatives of the great bo|dy of the people at large, and endeavouring to ve&s;t them&s;elves with legal authority. I &s;ay this alone is &s;editious and contrary to law: the people of Great Britain are repre&s;ented by their delegates in parliament; there their repre&s;entation lies, and an attempt of any other body of men to call them&s;elves the repre&s;entatives of the people is &s;editious&mdash;is illegal. A convention, it is very true, is not a name &s;o entirely new in Scotland as might have been imagined; a convention was a legal name in Scotland, given to a legal body,
<PB N="131" REF="027591_0131_0FD54CAB28031678">
inve&s;ted by the &s;overeign with parliamentary powers, in &s;ome de|gree, at lea&s;t with powers very little &s;hort of tho&s;e ve&s;ted in the parliament. We know it was a convention of the delegates of the people in Scotland which accompli&s;hed the Revolution: at that period, the people of Scotland alarmed at an indignant inva&s;ion of their rights, &s;eeing their privileges in church and &s;tate invaded and threatened with the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a de&s;potic power; at that pe|riod, that memorable period to which we all look back, at lea&s;t in name, with reverence, at that period, the people of Scotland, all that was great and good and wi&s;e in this country, a&s;&s;embled; at that time we needed not delegates from corre&s;ponding &s;ocieties in London, there was then no occa&s;ion for inflammatory hand-bills and two-penny pamphlets; the people of Scotland know when their rights are invaded; at that time their con&s;titution was attacked, and a de&s;potic power threatened them; at that time a convention met of every thing great, re&s;pectable, and good; and they e&s;tabli&s;h|ed the principles of the <HI>Claim of Rights,</HI> and provided again&s;t any encroachment upon that con&s;titution, by &s;uch guards as appear|ed to them to be perfectly &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>But, gentlemen, what is the object of this Briti&s;h Convention of the delegates of the people? We are told it is to obtain univer&s;al &s;uffrage. I &s;ay, gentlemen, that univer&s;al &s;uffrage is not only con|trary to, not only not authorized by the con&s;titution of Great Bri|tain, but a complete &s;ubver&s;ion of that form of government under which we live, and which was e&s;tabli&s;hed at the time of the Re|volution. At that period our forefathers publi&s;hed to the world their ideas of government in the <HI>Claim of Rights;</HI> they declared o|penly and manfully what they thought &s;ufficient to make them a free and a happy people, and to &s;upport the con&s;titution. And, give me leave to &s;ay, and tell many of tho&s;e people who talk &s;o loudly of the <HI>Claim of Rights</HI> which they never read, that every right then &s;tipulated for by our forefathers, every title of them is at this moment enjoyed by the poore&s;t wretch that breathes in Scotland. If the gentleman can &s;hew me one &s;ingle in&s;tance in which the <HI>Claim of Rights</HI> is invaded. I will this moment &s;it down and give up the argument. But we are told that univer&s;al &s;uf|frage is a &s;peculative opinion with re&s;pect to government; that wi&s;e men differ upon it, and that it is a part of the freedom which we enjoy to have the liberty of fairly di&s;cu&s;&s;ing every political &s;ubject, and this among the re&s;t. Gentlemen, this is a propo&s;ition which I will take the liberty to deny. I will take the liberty to &s;ay, that the maintaining the freedom of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of political que&s;tions to that length which is &s;ubver&s;ive of the con&s;titution is mo&s;t illegal and mo&s;t uncon&s;titutional; for, what is the &s;ituation in which we all &s;tand? We are not here in a &s;tate of nature, we are not &s;avages, and now for the fir&s;t time to chu&s;e a con&s;titution for our&s;elves; not like a man &s;hipwrecked upon a de&s;ert i&s;land, free to chu&s;e any mode of government we plea&s;e. No; we are all o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

us born &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h empire, &s;ubjects of Great Britain, which is the mo&s;t ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing, and the mo&s;t ine&s;timable birth-right that can be be&s;towed upon us. From our birth we owe allegiance to the con&s;titution e&s;tabli&s;hed at the Revolution; we are not to venture to &s;ay that another con&s;titution would do bet|ter in its place. I &s;ay, by law we owe allegiance to it from our birth, and by law we are bound to prevent it being encroached up|on, and that no body of men have a liberty to &s;ay we will indulge in &s;peculation, and there is no harm in &s;peculation, I &s;ay, that &s;ub|jects of Great Britain, born under allegiance to the con&s;titution, have no &s;uch liberty. Now, gentlemen, I a&s;k was univer&s;al &s;uf|frage any part of the con&s;titution e&s;tabli&s;hed at the Revolution? Was it ever &s;o much as thought of? Was it ever &s;o much as men|tioned among tho&s;e rights which our ance&s;tors have e&s;tabli&s;hed? Not a word. The patriots of tho&s;e days to whom we are &s;o much indebted, had too much good &s;en&s;e not to &s;ee that any &s;cheme of that kind was incon&s;i&s;tent with that &s;pecies of government, compo&s;|ed of monarchy, ari&s;tocracy, and democracy, which was then e&s;tab|li&s;hed; they &s;aw that any &s;cheme of that kind would be incon&s;i&s;|tent with it, and that it would be dangerous and chimerical: but what their good &s;en&s;e led them to &s;ee and to &s;hun we are able to judge of upon much &s;urer grounds. This topic is no longer a mat|ter of theory, in which men will indulge, as they plea&s;e, their dif|ferent opinions; it is a matter which has been brought to the te&s;t of experience, in the only ca&s;e in which it has been tried &s;ince the world began (for the Anglo Saxon government knew of no &s;uch thing): one experiment has been tried, in the government of France, and the re&s;ult of that experiment I &s;hall not mention; it is a &s;ub|ject from which I turn a&s;ide with horror and dete&s;tation, and yet this is the time after this experiment has been tried, after it has produced tho&s;e horrible mi&s;chiefs in a neighbouring country, which we cannot think of without &s;huddering, this is the very time when this Briti&s;h Convention will lift up their own mad opinions again&s;t the experience of ages, when they &s;ay in &s;pite of the Re|volution, in &s;pite of the principles then e&s;tabli&s;hed, and in &s;pite of what has happened in France, we will obtain this univer&s;al &s;uf|frage, which, if obtained in any country in the world, would ju&s;t produce the &s;ame con&s;equences, or nearly the &s;ame that it has done in that unhappy ill-&s;ated country which I ju&s;t now alluded to.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;hall only &s;uppo&s;e, that in place of a&s;&s;ociating them&s;elves for the purpo&s;e of obtaining univer&s;al &s;uffrage, as they tell us, &s;uppo&s;e they had entitled them&s;elves an a&s;&s;ociation, in order to obtain a demolition of kingly power and nobility; to be &s;ure they might have told us it was mere matter of &s;peculation, that many good men had thought we were much better without kings and without nobles; but I am &s;ure, living in this country and un|der the con&s;titution of Great-Britain, any propo&s;ition of that kind maintained by any body of men, would be illegal and &s;editious.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="027591_0133_0FD54CACE172AEE0">Gentlemen, having &s;hewn you that the object of this a&s;&s;ociation was illegal, let us now con&s;ider the means which they took to ac|compli&s;h their object, which include the different acts of &s;edition charged again&s;t this pannel, becau&s;e every one and all of tho&s;e &s;teps which they took, toward obtaining this favourable object, are gro&s;s and aggravated in&s;tances of &s;edition.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the title which this meeeting a&s;&s;umed to it&s;elf I have already &s;poke of; and which was, I apprehend, in it&s;elf illegal, as calling them&s;elves the delegates of the people, that is to &s;ay, the delegates of the people at large.</P>
<P>But the libel further &s;tates, <Q>and did in the whole form and man|ner of their procedure, as well as in the principles they avowed and propagated, clearly and unequivocally demon&s;trate, that their purpo&s;es were of the mo&s;t dangerous and de&s;tructive tendency, ho|&s;tile to the peace and happine&s;s, and tending to &s;ubvert the con&s;ti|tution of this realm, imitating in the form and tenor of their pro|ceedings the convention of France, the public and avowed enemies of this country, and with whom Great-Britain then was and &s;till is at war, the members calling each other at their meetings by the name of Citizen, dividing them&s;elves into &s;ections, receiving re|ports from &s;aid &s;ections,</Q> and &s;o on. Gentlemen, for evidence of this, be&s;ides the te&s;timony of the witne&s;&s;es that was delivered in your pre&s;ence, I only refer you to the minutes of the convention which will be lying before you when you deliberate upon this &s;ubject. Turn to every page, and you will &s;ee there is no part of it the language of Great Britain, but all of it this new fangled jargon which has been accompanied with &s;o much confu&s;ion. We find Committees of Fi|nance, of Organization, Primary A&s;&s;emblies, and &s;o on. You will find, by looking at the minutes, or the&s;e reports of &s;ections found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Skirving, the mo&s;t complete evidence of this; and I believe there is not a &s;ingle phra&s;e of mi&s;chief, con&s;ecrated to every thing that is bad in France, but has been adopted by the members of the Briti&s;h convention.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is very true, that this mode of imitation is not, by the law of Scotland, a crime in it&s;elf, nor do I charge it as &s;uch; it is only mentioned in the libel as a circum&s;tance of evidence, in or|der to &s;hew to the jury the general views and intentions of the par|ties. There is nothing wrong in the word convention, there is no|thing wrong in organization, or in liberty and equality; there is no|thing wrong in the&s;e words nor any other in the whole Engli&s;h Dic|tionary; it is the improper a&s;&s;ociation of them which I apprehend here, go to mark the dark and dangerous de&s;igns which the&s;e peo|ple have not been able to conceal. Prudence might have told them, that whatever alterations they meant to make in this country, they &s;hould not have borrowed the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of France; but the fury of reformation was &s;o mad, and &s;o rapidly did the torrent run, that they were always &s;peaking out the beloved object they had in view;
<PB N="134" REF="027591_0134_0FD54C84E3BC25C8">
and thus we have Committees of Finance, of In&s;truction, of Organ|ization, and all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you were told the other day, by a very ingenious coun&s;el on the part of Mr. Gerrald, that this imitation of French manners was by no means new in this country; that &s;omething of the &s;ame kind had taken place before, and nobody ever found fault with it. It is true, we may all remember when all the fopperies of the fa&s;hions of France were our objects of imitation; but did they endanger the con&s;titution of this country? Wa&s; it ever pretended that they were to give laws to Britain, and alter her con&s;titution? Did the taylors, the milliners, or the frizeurs ever pretend to legi&s;late for this country? Did they ever pretend any thing but to make our coats or powder our heads? That &s;pecies of imitation may be ridi|culous, as it certainly was; but it was perfectly innocent; it had not the &s;malle&s;t re&s;emblance to that of which the&s;e gentlemen have been guilty; it no more re&s;embles it than if a man &s;hould chu&s;e to plea&s;e him&s;elf with the diverting tricks of a monkey; this might be inno|cent, but it does not follow that in &s;ociety he would be allowed to imitate the &s;avage ferocity of a tyger; the one may be ridiculous, but the other is dete&s;table and dangerous: it is on that account, and not becau&s;e it was an imitation of French manners, that it is charged as pointing out the mi&s;chievous views and intentions which actuated the minds of the&s;e people.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the libel next proceeds to &s;tate &s;everal &s;peeches made by this pannel, who, by all accounts, appeared to have a talent for public &s;peaking, of which you in all probability will &s;oon have a &s;pe|cimen; and he certainly has a talent for compo&s;ition; of that we can all judge. It is &s;tated, that on the 21&s;t of November, he made the &s;peech which is engro&s;&s;ed at length in the libel, and which has been read before you this day. Gentlemen, the evidence that he made the &s;peech does not re&s;t &s;olely on the te&s;timony of the Gazetteer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">hough even that I &s;hould have thought &s;ufficient evidence to e&s;tab|li&s;h the general import and &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;peech; becau&s;e, I will read to you an abridgment of that &s;peech, taken from an authority which the gentleman will not pretend to que&s;tion, I mean the mi|nutes of the convention, which is ju&s;t as bad, or rather wor&s;e if any thing, than that publi&s;hed in the Gazetteer: <HI>(reads from the minutes)</HI> <Q>Mr. Gerrald ob&s;erved, that whatever difference of opinion might exi&s;t within tho&s;e walls, we can never forget that our friends and our enemies are in common, and that our object is equally the &s;ame; &mdash;he took a view of the means we &s;hould take to gain our object&mdash;, entered fully into our right to Annual Parliaments&mdash;minutely in|ve&s;tigated the Principles of Government&mdash;a&s;&s;erted that the end of all government is the good of the governed,' which is certainly very true&mdash;' that if money is taken out of our pockets, it &s;ignifies not whether it is by the robber on the heath, or the monarch on the throne&mdash;made many remarks on the Revolution-&s;ettlement, and the benefits derived from the Revolution, but clearly demon|&s;trated

that they are now totally taken away,</Q> which agrees with the words in the Gazetteer, <Q>that the pre&s;ent form of government no more re&s;embles the Revolution than a dead putrid carca&s;e does a living body.</Q> Now, if you compare the&s;e together, you will find, that this &s;hort account is a mo&s;t faithful and accurate abridg|ment of Mr. Gerrald's &s;peech, as &s;tated in the Gazetteer, which I &s;hall not trouble you with reading again&mdash;there are ju&s;t two &s;ingle pa&s;&s;ages I beg leave to call your attention to: <Q>It was ju&s;tly ob|&s;erved by Citizen Callander, that, &s;oon after the union of the crowns of England and Scotland, the people of both countries were deprived of &s;ome of their mo&s;t valuable privileges. It was from that period that the greate&s;t encroachments began to be made on public liberty, but, if that union has operated to rob us of our rights, let it be the object of the pre&s;ent one to regain them. If the event exi&s;ts for our &s;hame, as it has exi&s;ted for our cha&s;ti&s;e|ment, let it al&s;o exi&s;t for our in&s;truction.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, I here &s;ay, that that is a mo&s;t abominable li|bel upon the union of the two kingdoms, one of the mo&s;t au&s;pici|ous events that ever happened, to &s;ay, that 'from that period, the greate&s;t encroachments began to be made upon public liberty, is an a&s;&s;ertion that is mo&s;t fal&s;e and &s;editious; for &s;ince that pe|riod there have been no encroachments upon public liberty, and no individual citizen has been deprived of any of his mo&s;t valua|ble privileges.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the only other pa&s;&s;ages that I &s;hall take notice of in this &s;peech is this: <Q>It has been ob&s;erved, that the Revolution of 1688 did not produce the advantages which might have been ex|pected from &s;uch an event. It is true that, at the Revolution, univer&s;al &s;uffrage was not di&s;pen&s;ed to the people with that libe|rality which it ought to have been; but &s;till, the pre&s;ent form of government, in my opinion, no more re&s;embles the Revolu|tion, than a dead putrid carca&s;e does a living body:</Q> which is ju&s;t &s;aying in other and more florid words what is &s;tated in the minutes, that the ble&s;&s;ings obtained by the Revolution-&s;ettlement were now totally done away.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the next branch of the indictment which we &s;hall proceed to, which is the mo&s;t material and the mo&s;t inexcu&s;able of the whole, which carries the deepe&s;t guilt again&s;t this pannel, is what relates to Citizen Callander's motion, the proceedings of the convention which followed upon it, and the &s;hare which this pannel took in its proceedings.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, in order that you may have a complete view of this important branch of the cau&s;e you have to try, I &s;hall &s;tate from the minutes, progre&s;&s;ively, the hi&s;tory of the proceedings which took place with regard to this motion of Citizen Callander's. The bu&s;ine&s;s originated in a motion made by Citizen Callander, a gen|tleman now under &s;entence of fugitation, for the part he took in this bu&s;ine&s;s; he did not dare to &s;tand his trial. Citizen A. Cal|lander
<PB N="136" REF="027591_0136_0FD7BF57E2FA0E48">
moved, <Q>That in ca&s;e the mini&s;ter bring into the Commons Hou&s;e of Parliament a motion for a Convention Bill, it &s;hall be noticed immediately to the delegates.</Q> This is the general &s;ub|&s;tance of Mr. Callander's motion, as taken down in the minutes of the convention, upon the 25th of November; and upon the 27th it is debated in the convention. <Q>Mr. Callander's motion being then taken under con&s;ideration, amendments were propo&s;ed by Citizens Downie, Sinclair, Margarot, and Gartley. Citizen Mar|garot was for adopting the &s;pirit of the motion, but thought it more expedient to po&s;tpone it till the conclu&s;ion of the convention bu&s;ine&s;s, and moved that a committee, con&s;i&s;ting of the mover, &s;econder, and tho&s;e who had moved for amendments, be appoint|ed to draw up a motion that may probably meet the ideas of all. After &s;ome con&s;ideration it was agreed, upon the motion of Mr. Callander, that the &s;en&s;e of the hou&s;e &s;hould be taken, fir&s;t upon the &s;pirit of the motion, &s;econdly, upon the words of the motion, and thirdly upon Mr. Margarot's motion. Upon the fir&s;t motion it was carried unanimou&s;ly to adopt the motion as to its &s;pirit; &s;econdly, by a great majority not to adopt the words of it; and thirdly, that the amendments referred to a committee as above.</Q> So that you &s;ee, gentlemen, the re&s;ult of this debate upon Callan|der's motion is to adopt the &s;pirit of it, but with re&s;pect to amend|ments to refer it to a committee.</P>
<P>Then, gentlemen, let us &s;ee what the minutes &s;ay further upon this &s;ubject: "Upon the 28th of November the motion is again taken in|to con&s;ideration, and the report of the committee, to whom it was referred to make the amendments upon Callander's motion, is brought up: <Q>Citizen Sinclair read the amendments upon Citizen Callander's motion, as agreed upon by the committee, and it was agreed upon the motion of Citizen Blank, that the hou&s;e &s;hould re&s;olve it&s;elf into a committee for its mature con&s;ideration. In the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation, Citizen Brown gave a hi&s;tory of the <HI>Habeas Cor|pus Act.</HI> After an excellent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the que&s;tion, pertinent re|marks, and amendments the convention wa&s; re&s;umed, and the whole as amended, being read over, the members &s;tood upon their feet, and &s;olemnly and unanimou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;olution as follows.</Q>&mdash; After this there is a blank of a page and upwards, which I &s;hall af|terwards fill up to your &s;atisfaction: in the mean time I &s;hall go on with the minutes.</P>
<P><Q>Citizen Gerrald in a very energetic and animated addre&s;s, ex|pre&s;&s;ed his happine&s;s at the motion pa&s;&s;ed; Citizen Brown followed him in a manly &s;peech, and proved the influence of the executive government over the parliament; Citizen Margarot then read, and propo&s;ed the following motion: That a Committee of three and the &s;ecretary, be appointed to determine the place where &s;uch conven|tion of emergency &s;hall meet, that &s;uch place &s;hall remain a &s;ecret with them, and with the &s;ecretary of the convention, and that each delegate &s;hall, at the breaking up of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, be en|tru&s;ted

This motion was &s;econded by Citizen Moffat and pa&s;&s;ed unanimou&s;ly.</Q> Now, gentlemen, let us go back to the blank, which I &s;hall now be able to fill up, as I believe, to the full &s;atisfaction of every man who hears me; the blank is to be filled up by the amended re&s;olution pro|po&s;ed by Sinclair, which amended re&s;olution is one of the papers, two copies of which were found in Sinclair's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion when he was apprehended by Lyon, and carried to the &s;heriff-clerk's office, there inventoried, and now lie upon the table: one of them appears to be a good deal blotted and interlined, which is entitled at the back, in the hand writing of Mr. Aitche&s;on, <Q>Mr. Sinclair's amendment of Mr. Callender's motion</Q> and that important paper I mu&s;t now beg to read to you, fully authenticated as it is: <Q>Re&s;olved that the following declaration and re&s;olutions be in&s;erted at the end of your minutes.</Q> And you will now attend to a paragraph in the Ga|zetteer, which Ro&s;s took down, and which he &s;ays he does not re|collect, but which you have in the minutes, in the Gazetteer, and in the indictment. <Q>Re&s;olved, that this convention, con&s;idering the calamitous con&s;equences of any act of the legi&s;lature which may tend to deprive the whole, or any part of the people, of their undoubted right to meet, either by them&s;elves or by delegation, to di&s;cu&s;s any matter relative to their common intere&s;t, whether of a public or private nature, and holding the &s;ame to be totally incon|&s;i&s;tent with the fir&s;t principles and &s;afety of &s;ociety, and al&s;o &s;ub|ver&s;ive of our own and acknowledged con&s;titutional liberties, do hereby declare, before God and the world, that we &s;hall follow the whole&s;ome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which &s;hall militate again&s;t the con&s;titution of our country; and &s;hall continue to a&s;&s;emble, and con&s;ider of the be&s;t means by which we can accompli&s;h a real Repre&s;entation of the People, and Annual Election, until compelled de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force.</Q></P>

<P><Q>The convention doth therefore re&s;olve, That each delegate, immediately on his return home, do convene his con&s;tituents, and explain to them the nece&s;&s;ity of electing a delegate, or dele|gates, and of e&s;tabli&s;hing a fund without delay, again&s;t any of the&s;e emergencies, for his or their expence; and that they do in|&s;truct the &s;aid delegate, or delegates, to hold them&s;elves ready to depart at one hour's warning</Q> This is the re&s;olution which, even the audacity of the convention dare not in&s;ert in the minutes, and I am not &s;urpri&s;ed at it&mdash;a more daring in&s;ult to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed government of the country never exi&s;ted. Gentlemen, upon the fir&s;t part of it, an attempt, or &s;omething like one, was made by the coun&s;el to quibble away the import of it, that they would pay no re|gard to any act of the legi&s;lature; that is, that as &s;oon as &s;uch a bill was brought in, they would meet, and endeavour to prevent it from pa&s;&s;ing; but if you attend, you will &s;ee this could not be the mean|ing of it, it is, as plain as words can make it, a re&s;olution upon the part of the&s;e gentlemen, to bid defiance to the legi&s;lature of Great Britain. That we who know better than you, will oppo&s;e force to force, and in&s;tead of paying regard to it, will make it a &s;ignal for us to hold a Convention of Emergency, to be held at a place unknown to the parties them&s;elves to be fixed by a &s;ecret committee, and that each of the delegates &s;hall be entru&s;ted with a &s;ealed letter contain|ing the name of the place of meeting. This is one occa&s;ion of the meeting of the convention of emergency, but it is not the only one; there is another which well de&s;erves your &s;erious con&s;ideration; one of the ca&s;es &s;pecified in which this convention were to meet, in a place unknown to any but a cho&s;en few of their own number, is in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion. Gentlemen, this is not entirely a fancied ca&s;e; we all know that an inva&s;ion of this country has been projected, was then, and is yet in agitation, (when it will be attempted God only knows) by its mo&s;t inveterate foes, not as in former times proceeding from a rival&s;hip in arms&mdash;a conte&s;t of ambition&mdash;no, the object of the in|va&s;ion as declared by them&s;elves, is no le&s;s than to annihilate the Go|vernment of Great Britain; to cut it up as a mon&s;trous piece of ty|ranny, to de&s;troy that favorite of liberty and of wi&s;dom that was rear|ed by our ance&s;tors, and which has &s;o long been the glory and pride of every Briton and the admiration of mankind; and which, for that rea&s;on, has been &s;o long the envy of our foes. This con&s;titution, in the pre&s;ervation of which is involved every privilege, every public right, and I will add to it every dome&s;tic comfort, is by this inva&s;ion to be &s;wept away at once; a calamity which, if it &s;hould happen, (which I tru&s;t it never will, but no thanks to tho&s;e gentlemen) than compared with which, what is there in the hi&s;tory of man to equal it? Of all the calamities, of all the puni&s;hments that ever were in|flicted upon a nation, if the whole vials of divine vengeance were to
<PB N="139" REF="027591_0139_0FD54CB227060938">
be exhau&s;ted upon any people, or all the calamities that can proceed from the convul&s;ions of nature, or pe&s;tilence, or &s;till more de&s;olating famine; I &s;ay the whole of the&s;e calamities compared with a &s;ucce&s;s|ful French inva&s;ion, I might for my own part, con&s;ider as vi&s;itations of kindne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion; and yet this is one of the ca&s;es which their re&s;olution provides for. This is the cri&s;is, this is the moment which, if ever it &s;hould occur, and it may, God knows how &s;oon, when the power of Britain mu&s;t be exerted. Let me &s;uppo&s;e the e|vent, that the French a&s;&s;embled near our coa&s;ts; &s;uppo&s;e them (which God forbid) either to vanqui&s;h Britain or defeat her vigilane and ar|rive, and prepare to land&mdash;in that awful moment, when the armies of Britain, I tru&s;t, under their &s;overeign &s;hall mu&s;ter upon the coa&s;t to repel the foe, &s;hall carry with, them the wi&s;hes of every good citi|zen, every thing that is wi&s;e and good in the country giving every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power; in that dreadful hour where are we to find the Briti&s;h Convention? Do we find them a&s;&s;embling under the ban|ners of our con&s;titution? No, they tell us, that it is their re&s;olution, that they have declared before God and the word, that in that hour they will, con&s;pirator-like, &s;link into a corner, &s;hun their fellow-citi|zens, form a body of their own, and meet in a place where they them|&s;elves know not, and is only to be unfolded by the opening of a &s;eal|ed letter when the hour arrives.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, though the mind of man can only be viewed by that All-&s;eeing Eye which can pierce into it, yet a human tribunal can judge of intentions from actions; and taking the actions of tho&s;e men, a proved by the mo&s;t authentic documents, they were dark, they were dangerous.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it has been &s;aid that it might be their intention to unite them&s;elves to repel a foreign&mdash;to repel an inva&s;ion. Had that been their intention, would they have cho&s;en to &s;ecret them|&s;elves from the re&s;t of their countrymen? Were they &s;o mad (and mad I admit they were in many things) as to think that a hun|dred men, or whatever their number was, were &s;ufficient to repel an inva&s;ion? No; to a foreign foe, &s;uch a force as theirs mu&s;t appear contemptible. It is true, they were formidable, not by their numbers, nor by their arms, but they were formidable by being an enemy in our own bo&s;oms. This, this alone made them formidable. As to its being their intention to repel the inva&s;ion, it is too eccentric, I am &s;ure, to gain credit from any man.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, what mighty motives had this convention to &s;tand forth to repel this ho&s;t coming again&s;t us? Suppo&s;e the period arrived, they behold the power of Britain a&s;&s;embled under its law|ful &s;overeign; there they &s;ee a king, a government which they con&s;ider as no better than a dead carca&s;e; there they &s;ee an ari&s;to|cracy which is hateful to them. Do they &s;ee univer&s;al &s;uffrage? No; it is that which can never, be allowed by the con&s;titution of Britain. But what is the ca&s;e? They meet in a dark place. What do they meet for? To obtain univer&s;al &s;uffrage. What do
<PB N="140" REF="027591_0140_0FD7BF60C7DD0FC0">
the invaders offer them? Univer&s;al &s;uffrage&mdash;you &s;hall have it from the pure fountain head, from the &s;ource of every thing that is wi&s;e of political in&s;tructions, from the fountain head, the Con|vention of Paris. You &s;hall have no ari&s;tocracy&mdash;you &s;hall have no religion, if you plea&s;e; but of that I &s;ay nothing&mdash;you &s;hall have primary a&s;&s;emblies&mdash;you &s;hall have every one of the&s;e things which you appear to be &s;o remarkably fond of. Gentlemen, it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to carry the matter &s;o far as to &s;uppo&s;e that this pannel or the other members came to the dark, the de&s;perate, the wicked re&s;olution of joining the foes of Britain, in ca&s;e of an inva|&s;ion, it is by no means nece&s;&s;ary. But &s;uppo&s;ing they meant to go no further than what they declared, to meet in a &s;ecret place, un|known to the government of this country, perhaps to negociate with a foreign enemy; but in either way their intention was dark, it was wicked, it was criminal. Gentlemen, with regard to many of the members, I do in charity believe, that they concurred in this re&s;olution, not &s;eeing the precipice on which they &s;tood, uncon&s;ci|ous of the end to which it tended. But I am &s;orry to &s;ay that is an apology that will not do for Mr. Gerrald; he is a man who &s;upports this re&s;olution, and follows it up by an inflammatory &s;peech; it is impo&s;&s;ible that he could be ignorant of the point to which it led; it is impo&s;&s;ible he could be innocent, he mu&s;t be more or le&s;s criminal, and the &s;malle&s;t criminality that can be a&s;cribed is very great indeed, far more than &s;ufficient to &s;upport the charge of &s;edition which I have made again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, the next thing is the &s;peech of which the mi|nutes very &s;hortly &s;ay, <Q>Citizen Gerrald, in a very energetic and animated addre&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed his happine&s;s at the motion pa&s;&s;ed.</Q> Gentlemen, I &s;hall only read one or two expre&s;&s;ions in it, and you will attend to the occa&s;ion upon which it was made; it was made ju&s;t after the convention had pa&s;&s;ed this &s;olemn re&s;olution and de|claration before God and the world; in this &s;tate, when their minds were in this &s;ituation, in a &s;tate of avowed ho&s;tility, Mr Gerrald ro&s;e up and made a &s;peech, adding fuel to the flame, he &s;ays, <Q>Though I could not get a copy of this bill, the heads of which I have read are &s;ufficiently explanatory of its dete&s;table principles; and I hope the mea&s;ures which have been adopted this night will convince the mi|ni&s;ter, that we are determined to guard again&s;t every attempt that may be made to deprive us of our rights. And though by &s;ome it may be thought a bold, by &s;ome a daring mea&s;ure, yet it will be found the be&s;t for &s;ecuring the peace of our country. For if &s;uch a law were &s;uffered to pa&s;s, if men were not allowed to utter their complaints, a number of fierce and rancorous pa&s;&s;ions would ari&s;e, and we would &s;eek to appeal to that la&s;t terrible deci&s;ion, the event of which is uncertain, but which God and nature allows.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If the &s;ervility of the people had been le&s;s; if they had dared to meet, and, in place of murmuring, to have told their rulers that there was danger in &s;eeking to deprive them of their liber|ties,
<PB N="141" REF="027591_0141_0FD54CB3637CEE30">
we would not have had to adopt this re&s;olution to-night; but when I &s;aw the calm deliberate countenances of all pre&s;ent, and the &s;olemn manner in which it was pa&s;&s;ed, I was convinced that it would not only be a re&s;olution of words, but a rule of ac|tion.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, upon the reading of this &s;peech, you will con&s;ider that it was addre&s;&s;ed to a number of per&s;ons who had, a few minutes be|fore, come to the re&s;olution of flying in the face of the legi&s;lature, which is &s;o plain that I &s;hall &s;ay no more about it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have now gone through the charges in the indict|ment, and I think I have e&s;tabli&s;hed every one of them in &s;uch a way as mu&s;t have given you &s;atisfaction. The only part of the charge that remains is, that at the time the magi&s;trates came to di&s;|per&s;e them, even after that Mr. Gerrald again takes the chair, and would not leave it till he was turned out; they declaring that the di&s;per|&s;ion was of no con&s;equence, for they had declared them&s;elves perma|nent. Upon that it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing, becau&s;e you heard the evidence was given upon it; and you will give it &s;uch attention as you think proper.</P>
<P>Thus I have endeavoured to lay before you what appeared to me to be the mo&s;t material parts of the charge again&s;t this gentleman, &s;ub&s;tantiated by that evidence which appears to me &s;o &s;atisfactory; and as the pannel has produced no evidence, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ee what defence he may make. I &s;hall only &s;ay, in general, that if he di&s;putes the fact, I refer you to the evidence now lying upon the table. If he &s;ays that the facts, &s;uppo&s;ing they are true, are not criminal, I appeal to your own common &s;en&s;e, I appeal to your own judgments, to the judgments of every court of law who have ever decided in criminal ca&s;es. If he &s;hould &s;ay, notwith&s;tanding all (for his coun&s;el in&s;inuated &s;omething of the kind,) that he acted from the pure&s;t intentions, and that his intentions were innocent, I mu&s;t tell you, that with regard to the ab&s;olute purity of his intention, it is impo&s;&s;ible for human penetration to &s;ee; that mu&s;t be re&s;erved in every ca&s;e to the la&s;t day, when every truth mu&s;t come out; but you, as well as every other tribunal, mu&s;t judge according to the evidence and according to the facts as they lie before you; and from tho&s;e facts I think I have &s;atisfied you, that their intentions were &s;editious, wicked, and criminal. I &s;hall trouble you no further upon this ca&s;e, but leave it to your deci&s;ion. I have &s;tated the grounds upon which I think my&s;elf entitled to demand a verdict of guilty.</P>
<P>MR. GERRALD.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the jury, Mr. Solicitor General has told you with great truth and &s;olemnity, that the cau&s;e of which you are at pre&s;ent the judges, is one of the mo&s;t important which ever came before man for the purpo&s;e of determination.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="027591_0142_0FD54C8AE1B77840">Gentlemen, if at an early period of my life it had been announced to me, that the ta&s;k of defending the rights and privileges of nine millions of people would have devolved upon me, a &s;imple individual, I &s;hould certainly, from my youth up, have devoted my whole time, with unremitting application, that I might be enabled to execute &s;o &s;acred and important a tru&s;t.

But what|ever be the re&s;ult of this day's deliberation, I &s;hall always look back to the part, which I have taken, with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a man who has endeavoured well; for, however weak the fle&s;h may be, the &s;pi|rit is &s;trongly inclined to the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the &s;tate pro&s;ecutions which agitated and di&s;graced the middle of the la&s;t century, were by no means of the &s;ame importance with tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>The conte&s;t between John Hampden and the crown re&s;ted &s;olely upon this que&s;tion; whether the crown or the parliament &s;hould have the power of rai&s;ing the &s;upplies; but it was always allowed that the object of the&s;e &s;upplies was the advancement of the general hap|pine&s;s. The cau&s;e which you are called to decide upon, is not mere|ly a matter of pecuniary con&s;ideration; you are called upon decide whether man, who is by his nature &s;ocial and rational, &s;hall meet in &s;ociety for the purpo&s;e of improving his faculties, and exerci&s;ing tho&s;e powers of rea&s;on which the common Father of us all has given us, to enlighten our under&s;tanding and enoble our hearts; or whether by relinqui&s;hing every thing that is virtuous, every thing that is prai&s;e|worthy, every thing that is valuable in the condition of our humani|ty, we &s;hall be reduced to a &s;ituation beneath the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, as an Engli&s;hman, I will not &s;ay a &s;tranger in this country, for, from being members of the &s;ame community we have the &s;ame friends and the &s;ame foes; and the articles of the Union, I believe, &s;ay, that the natives of both countries are entitled to the &s;ame privileges&mdash;yet as an Engli&s;hman, I cannot but con&s;ider my &s;ituation as varying in &s;ome mea&s;ure from that of a native of this country. In England, had I committed the &s;uppo&s;ed crime charged again&s;t me, the proce&s;s would have been very different. The pre|&s;ent legal proce&s;s too much re&s;embles tho&s;e in&s;tituted in the la&s;t century, when pro&s;ecutions upon pro&s;ecutions were in&s;tituted for the purpo&s;e of de&s;troying the freedom of our country: I &s;ay, the pro|ceedings of the High Court of Ju&s;ticiary too much re&s;emble the pro|ceedings of the Star Chamber before it was aboli&s;hed. We have not in this country the advantage which we have in England of the bills

being originally found by a grand jury. We have not afterwards the privilege of a petty jury &s;elected entirely by the &s;heriff; but I under&s;tand that the a&s;&s;ize is fir&s;t appointed by the public pro&s;ecutor, from which fifteen are afterwards &s;elected by the court.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance did not however deter me, (though it was fre|quently argued among&s;t other arguments) from coming down here to take my trial. No; when the &s;courges of the late pro&s;ecutions, and the melancholy fate of the pro&s;ecuted were held over my head, I was not to be deterred from doing my duty; though by many I was con&s;idered as devoted a victim as Regulus departing into voluntary exile, or like Curtius plunging into the gulf for the &s;alvation of his country.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, informations began in England, during the reign of one of our wor&s;t princes, Henry VII. who filled his private coffers by the plunder of his &s;ubjects. In conformity to this proce&s;s, I am &s;or|ry to acquaint you, that I was brought before the &s;heriff of this coun|ty by the operation, not by the regular &s;ervice, of a warrant. When I was taken up I a&s;ked for the warrant, but it was refu&s;ed. My temper, I tru&s;t, is mild and peaceful; though, in England had a &s;imilar proce&s;s taken place, the officer might have paid for his irre|gular conduct with the forfeiture of his life. But that was not my purpo&s;e; for as truth is my only object, &s;o rea&s;on is my only wea|pon. My papers were taken out of my bureau and carried before the &s;heriff. Knowing that tho&s;e papers could contain nothing to criminate me, I claimed them as my property, and &s;igned the claim without any he&s;itation. I am &s;hocked, however, to think that &s;o gro&s;s a proceeding &s;hould take place in any country as a di&s;clo&s;ure of &s;ecrets by taking private papers. Since the original &s;eizure of my papers, a private letter has been arre&s;ted in its pa&s;&s;age to me from London, and in an attempt to &s;ee the contents, has been de|&s;troyed without it's ever reaching me. I demanded what could be the object of this procedure. I was informed that it was for the purpo&s;e of collecting evidence again&s;t me. This oollection of evi|dence then, it &s;eems, may be made with impunity in Scotland, by as gro&s;s a violation of the laws of the land, as certain other collec|tions are made, of which the collectors when taken are afterwards hanged.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the Solicitor General acknowledged with much candor, that if he could not prove the criminal intention, he could prove no|thing. It is upon this grand principle that I re&s;t my defence; it is neither upon legal chicanery nor legal quibbles, the&s;e would be un|worthy of the cau&s;e in which I am engaged. If the criminality of the intention alone can con&s;titute the offence, either in a legal or moral point of view, I tru&s;t I &s;hall be able to make out &s;o clear a ca&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the calumnies which the lying breath of ru|mour may have ca&s;t upon me, that you your&s;elves, di&s;carding pre|judices which it is po&s;&s;ible you may have imbibed, will retire from this Court as fully &s;atisfied of my innocence as I am my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="027591_0144_0FD7BF366E177FE0">Gentlemen, if fugitation is in the eye of law deemed a pre&s;umption of guilt, appearance by parity of rea&s;on mu&s;t be deemed a pre&s;ump|tion of innocence. Notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations and &s;trong inducements held out to me by the &s;ociety who delegated me, and who would have paid my bail, I determined to come down and appear before you. Can there then exi&s;t a &s;tronger proof of the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the puriry of my own intentions, than my having volun|tarily appeared before that tribunal which I might have &s;hunned, and from which innocence it&s;elf has fled?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, though it does not come immediately before you, I do conceive that by being brought to trial at this particular time is a har&s;h and rigorous mea&s;ure; and it is rather remarkable that on the la&s;t Monday, a period which was marked for the fir&s;t day of my trial, and when I appeared here before the Court, our Repre&s;entatives in Parliament were in fact &s;itting in judgment upon the&s;e very judges; nor do I think it would have degraded the dignity of their functions, if they had acted with le&s;s heat and more deliberation, and had pati|ently waited till the re&s;ult of the proceedings of the High Court of Parliament had been known upon their conduct.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the hi&s;tory of Briton furni&s;hes us with abunda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t in|&s;tances of the interference of the legi&s;lature to correct judicial errors. In the ca&s;e of Hampden, which was a period which mu&s;t be dear and valuable to every Engli&s;hman, the parliament, by their interference, prevented the robbery of the &s;ubject, by the arbitrary fiat of the crown. It is not fit, I own, that they &s;hould interfere where the pub|lic is not deeply intere&s;ted; but where it is, they are bound to do &s;o in ju&s;tice to their repre&s;entatives, and they always have done &s;o. Nay, they have gone further, and where the nece&s;&s;ity was great, they have even come to a re&s;olution in point of law, contrary to the judgment of a court of law, and to the opinion of ten out of twelve judges. In ca&s;e the judges violated the law (a circum&s;tance which in the late ca&s;es is yet to be determined,) or where they &s;u&s;pected any undue in|fluence, either in the exertion or the &s;upport of the prerogative, by officers, of the crown, or by <HI>judges,</HI> they have always interpo&s;ed. Is it po&s;&s;ible to forget or to controvert either their conduct, or the propriety of it, in the great ca&s;e of &s;hip-money, which was fir&s;t brought into que&s;tion by Mr. Hampden, a private gentleman, who, &s;o far from regarding the trumpery, petty-fogging con&s;ideration of damages, declared, that he would not pay it were it but one far|thing, if pretended to be demanded of right, and by colour of law; and yet proceeded, according to my lord Clarendon's own account, with great temper and moderation in that &s;uit. His lord&s;hip adds, <Q>and all the world knows, that never any cau&s;e had been debated and argued more &s;olemnly before the judges, who, after long deli|beration among them&s;elves, and being attended with the records which had been cited on both &s;ides, delivered each man his opinion and judgment publicly in court, and &s;o largely, that but two judg|es argued in a day.</Q> Ten of them &s;olemnly pronounced their opi|nion
<PB N="145" REF="027591_0145_0FD54CB721E3A0F0">
for the right claimed by the crown, and which if had regularly exerci&s;ed for four years immediately preceding: but, as Lord Cla|rendon ob&s;erves, (Lord Clarendon was a monarchical man, much at|tached to Charles I.) <Q><HI>the judgment, proved of more credit and ad|vantage to the gentleman condemned than to the king's &s;ervice,</HI> how|ever, (adds he) the&s;e errors in government were pot to be imputed to the court at that time, but to the &s;pirit and over activity of the lawyers of the privy council, who &s;hould more carefully have pre&s;erved their profe&s;&s;ion and its profe&s;&s;ors from being profaned by tho&s;e &s;ervices which have rendered both &s;o obnoxious to re|proach.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, this circum&s;tance, I apprehend, is an object very im|portant for your con&s;ideration, and which, I tru&s;t, will have &s;ome influence in the guidance and direction of your verdict; ina&s;much as you find that in England, in a ca&s;e where ten out of twelve of the judges gave their opinions again&s;t the defendant, yet, &s;till their &s;en|tence was rever&s;ed at a higher tribunal, that of Parliament. The &s;entence was rever&s;ed, and even Clarendon, a monarchical man, who comes down to us under great purity of character, tells you, <Q>that the&s;e pro&s;ecutions were in&s;tituted and carried on by the crown lawyers, who were over active in the execution of their duty, and had &s;ubjected them and the profe&s;&s;ion as obnoxious to reproach.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, the indictment contains again&s;t me four charges I &s;hall endeavour briefly (in order that I may take up as little of your time as po&s;&s;ible) to &s;tate the&s;e charges &s;pecifically, and to give as &s;peci|fic an&s;wers to tho&s;e charges, as the combined operation of my un|der&s;tanding and my con&s;cience directs me to give.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t charge is of &s;o extraordinary a nature, that it was &s;ome time before I could bring my&s;elf to &s;it down to a &s;erious refutation of it; and upon any occa&s;ion not &s;o important as the pre&s;ent, I &s;hould either have combatted it with the weapon of ridicule, (of which, e|ven it is hardly de&s;erving) or have thrown it behind me with &s;ilent contempt. I have been charged with making u&s;e of French terms, though it has been proved, as I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew, that this charge, ridiculous as it is, is al&s;o fallacious.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is a mo&s;t extraordinary thing, that &s;uch a charge &s;hould be made in a country, again&s;t a native of that part of the king|dom, I &s;peak not of Scotland, but of England, where all our old law proceedings are in that very language. The writings of the venera|ble Littleton, who&s;e tenures contain the whole doctrine of our law of landed property, upon which my Lord Coke, the great Oracle of Engli&s;h Law, has written his Commentaries, are in the French language.</P>
<P>Britton, and other writers of as great authority, though of more remote antiquity, and who are deemed the legal patriarchs (as it were) in the hi&s;tory of juri&s;prudence, wrote in French; and the king him&s;elf, even at this period, never gives his a&s;&s;ent or refu&s;al to
<PB N="146" REF="027591_0146_0FD54C8EA2AE2898">
any act of parliament which binds the &s;ubject, without expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in the language of that country.</P>
<P>Gentleman, I &s;ay not this for the purpo&s;e of vindicating my&s;elf from the&s;e charges, for it has been proved to you clearly, from the evidence of Ro&s;s, that the&s;e French terms were of his own in&s;ertion. But I cannot help thinking that a &s;pirit of malevolence dictated that part of the charge, and that the&s;e invidious in&s;ertions were made for the purpo&s;e of in&s;u&s;ing into your minds an idea that I wi&s;hed to co-operate with F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance, with whom we are now at war: and I am the more authori&s;ed to &s;tate this as the fir&s;t indictment, with which I was &s;erved, was totally devoid of the&s;e charges, and they have only been introduced in the &s;econd. But the&s;e terms were the pepper and &s;alt to &s;ea&s;on the di&s;h for the gratification of the palate of the crown lawyers, and I, it &s;eems, was to be offered up, like another Theye&s;tes, as a victim for the banquet.</P>
<P>Gentleman, the next charge again&s;t me in that of having u&s;ed the word <HI>citizen.</HI> It was &s;aid upon a former occa&s;ion by the Solicitor General, that the u&s;e of the term was in it&s;elf innocent, and in many circum&s;tances might undoubtedly be proper; but here, a|gain he made a di&s;tinction. If a man, in the year 1745, (&s;aid he,) had walked the &s;treets with a white cockade, it would have been highly criminal; but now the action would be perfectly harmle&s;s, becau&s;e there is no party exi&s;ting among&s;t us of an attachment to whom it might be interpreted as an emblem.</P>
<P>But, gentlemen, I hope your under&s;tandings will not be pervert|ed by language of this kind, as you mu&s;t &s;ee a mo&s;t material and e&s;&s;ential difference between marching up the &s;treets with a white cockade, and u&s;ing the term <HI>citizen.</HI> The u&s;ing of this term, though it may by &s;ome be deemed ridiculous, can, by none, be judged criminal. The word <HI>citizen</HI> is a term of peace, and denotes that relation&s;hip in which we &s;tand to each other, as members, of the &s;ame community, for the performance of our <HI>civil duties;</HI> whereas the wearing of a cockade is the emblem of a military oc|cupation, and in the year 1745 was a particular and avowed em|blem of ho&s;tility to the government of the country.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the next part of the charge is, that the&s;e meetings were illegal and &s;editious. Now their illegality, I apprehend, mu&s;t depend either upon one or other of the&s;e three principles; either on the name <HI>Convention</HI> which we took, the principles which that convention intended to e&s;tabli&s;h, or the manner in which they conducted them&s;elves after they met. Take away the&s;e three things and no charge remains, con&s;equently no ground of criminal|ity. With regard to the fir&s;t, our a&s;&s;umption of the name of Con|vention, I am &s;ure your own under&s;tandings will inform you, and it is a po&s;ition to which the crown lawyers have a&s;&s;ented, that to take a particular name does not con&s;titute a crime. Many re&s;pect|able gentlemen, in point of fortune and talents, met in a Conven|tion,
<PB N="147" REF="027591_0147_0FD54CB8A4FE5A28">
expre&s;sly &s;o called, for a Reform in the Scotti&s;h Boroughs, in Edinburgh, and though their views were different from our, &s;till it &s;hews, that the bare a&s;&s;umption of that <HI>name</HI> does not con&s;ti|tute an offence in the eye of the law. Our crime mu&s;t then de|pend either upon the principles which the Briti&s;h Convention in|tended to e&s;tabli&s;h, or the manner in which they conducted them|&s;elves when met.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, in a cau&s;e &s;o &s;acred as the pre&s;ent, I would &s;corn to tell a lie to &s;ave my life. I boldly avow, and I hope the rea&s;ons on which I &s;hall defend the principles will be equal to the confidence with which I make the a&s;&s;ertion, that our object was to procure, by <HI>peace|ful</HI> means, Annual Parliaments and Univer&s;al Suffrage; and, in &s;o doing, notwith&s;tanding all the declamation that has been urged a|gain&s;t it, I &s;hall endeavour to convince you that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e principles is not only conformable to every maxim of &s;ound go|vernment, but congenial to the &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution it|&s;elf. In order, gentleman, to a&s;certain the fir&s;t point, that Univer|&s;al Suffrage (per&s;ons incapacitated by crimes and in&s;anity excepted) is in fact con&s;onant to the fir&s;t principles of all good government, it will be nece&s;&s;ary that we take &s;ome &s;hort view of the fundamental prin|ciples of &s;ociety it&s;elf. The great object of the &s;ocial in&s;titution, the great object for which men form them&s;elves into &s;ociety is, I appre|hend, the &s;afe enjoyment of their lives and property. If then, in the earlie&s;t &s;tages of &s;ociety, every man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a right to the pre|&s;ervation of his life, and al&s;o to the peaceable enjoyment of his pro|perty, it follows of cour&s;e, that the mode of government, which is be&s;t calculated for the attainment of tho&s;e ends for which government it&s;elf was in&s;tituted, mu&s;t be preci&s;ely that very mode of government which all rea&s;onable beings would wi&s;h to &s;ee univer&s;ally adopted a|mong&s;t men. Now, as every man claims from nature, a right of judging for him&s;elf on the be&s;t manner of promoting his own intere&s;t, and as no individual is born with any di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of pre-eminence over his fellow-men, or with any character of exemption from the ordinary frailties of human nature, &s;o every act of authority exerci&s;ed by one man over another, or by a legi&s;lature over, the <HI>collective body of the people,</HI> unle&s;s it be exerci&s;ed by the con&s;ent of the individual or of the collective body of the people governed, mu&s;t be an <HI>act of ty|ranny.</HI> The right of the exerci&s;e of the under&s;tanding is the no|ble&s;t privilege of our nature, and indeed is in&s;eparable from our con|dition as moral agents; moral agency, in fact, being nothing el&s;e, but the being guided by the dictates of our own under&s;tandings and con&s;ciences in preference to tho&s;e of another. And if, after the enact|ment of po&s;itive law, we &s;ubmit to its authority, from which our pri|vate judgment may have revolted, it is only becau&s;e a greater num|ber of rea&s;onable per&s;ons con&s;enting to the law, than of tho&s;e di&s;&s;ent|ing from it, carries with it the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umption that the pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch law has been the re&s;ult of a greater portion of rea&s;on, than its rejection would have been&mdash;that it is founded in ju&s;tice and truth,
<PB N="148" REF="027591_0148_0FD54C8FD36777E0">
and therefore more conducive to the great ends of &s;ociety, ina&s;much as it has received the authoritative &s;tamp of the approbation of the greater number of its members, who, in all well regulated communi|ties, being equally entitled to a participation of its benefits, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be equally intere&s;ted in promoting its welfare.</P>
<P>It is not true, that when men agree to erect a government they give up any portion of their rights. No; they only adopt a different mode of enjoying them. They give up nothing; but by combining their own <HI>particular</HI> force with the force of others, they adopt a plan, by which they are enabled to po&s;&s;e&s;s their rights in greater &s;ecurity. All ju&s;t government, therefore, being only a delegation, it cannot be armed with more power than it derives from the con&s;ent of them o|ver whom it is exerci&s;ed. Now, as prior to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of go|vernment, no man had a right to take from another any property without his con&s;ent, and as all ju&s;t authority exerci&s;ed by any govern|ment mu&s;t be derived from the people, &s;o the government (which is, in other words, a national a&s;&s;ociation for general good) cannot of right exerci&s;e any power, which one individual, before government was e&s;tabli&s;hed, was not authori&s;ed to exerci&s;e over another. Hooker, to whom Queen Elizabeth, always applied the ju&s;t epithets of learned and judicious, a&s;&s;erts, that the principle which I have ju&s;t &s;tated is the only &s;olid foundation of all legi&s;lative authority. Laws they are not, &s;ays he, which <HI>public approbation</HI> hath not made &s;o. <HI>Hooker's Eccles. Pol. lib.</HI> i. <HI>&s;ect.</HI> 10. And Mr. Locke expre&s;sly &s;ays, that, <Q>as government cannot be &s;upported without great charge (a truth which we, God knows! feel every day to our co&s;t,) &s;o it is fit that every one who enjoys his &s;hare of the pro|tection, &s;hould pay out of his e&s;tate his proportion for the main|tainance of it. But <HI>&s;till it mu&s;t be with his own con&s;ent,</HI> i. e. the con&s;ent of the majority, giving it either by them&s;elves, or their repre&s;entatives cho&s;en by them. For if any one &s;hall claim a power to law and levy taxes on the people, by his own autho|rity, and without &s;uch con&s;ent of the people, he thereby invades the fundamental law of property, <HI>and &s;ubverts the end of govern|ment.</HI> FOR, WHAT PROPERTY HAVE I IN THAT WHICH ANO|THER MAY, BY RIGHT, TAKE WHEN HE PLEASES TO HIMSELF?</Q> Here then, Gentlemen, is the doctrine or Univer&s;al Suffrage ex|pre&s;&s;ly laid down. For as no man, in a &s;tate of &s;ociety, can be al|together without property, either inherited or acquired by his daily labour, and as every man in the country pays a tax to government, either directly to the tax-gatherer, or indirectly through the com|modities which he con&s;umes, which all taxes ultimately affect, &s;o it appears to me clear as the light of Heaven, that every man of adult years, not incapacitated by crimes or in&s;anity, has a RIGHT TO A VOTE; otherwi&s;e he may exclaim, in the language of Mr. Locke, <Q>what properly have I in that which another may, by right take when he plea&s;es to him&s;elf?</Q> That government, then, gentle|men, which is not a government of <HI>con&s;ent,</HI> mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity, be
<PB N="149" REF="027591_0149_0FD7BF629AC1C310">
a government of <HI>u&s;urpation.</HI>&mdash;After all, there are but three modes, (except a man allows him&s;elf to be a public mendicant) in which money pa&s;&s;es from man to man; by force, by fraud, or con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, it will not be contended, except by conquerors or high|waymen, can ever e&s;tabli&s;h a ju&s;t ground of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. By the ope|ration of the &s;econd principle, I am afraid, it does pa&s;s, whenever a man pays a tax in a government in which he is not repre&s;ented.&mdash; During the American war, Lord Camden, the fir&s;t law authority in England, and now pre&s;ident of the council, repeatedly a&s;&s;erted, that "taxation and repre&s;entation were in&s;eparable." Now, if his lord|&s;hip meant any thing by the word repre&s;entation, he certainly mu&s;t have meant adequate repre&s;entation, for no other de&s;erves the name, or an&s;wers the end; which adequate repre&s;entation is well explained by Sir Thomas Smith, a writer of great note and authority, in his Commonwealth of England, p. 37. "Every Enli&s;hman," &s;ays he, <Q>is intended to be pre&s;ent in parliament, either in per&s;on, or by pro|curation and attorney, of whatever pre-eminence, &s;tate, dignity, or quality &s;oever he be, from the prince to the lowe&s;t per&s;on in Eng|land. And the con&s;ent of the parliament is taken to be EVERY MAN's con&s;ent.</Q> Here is the doctrine of Univer&s;al Suffrage, laid down in words as &s;trong as the Engli&s;h language can afford. It was then to repair the&s;e ravages, which time, whom my lord Bacon terms the greate&s;t INNOVATOR, had occa&s;ioned, that the Briti&s;h Conventi|on &s;at; it was not to deform our con&s;titution, but to re&s;tore it; it was not to promote, but to prevent its de&s;truction, that we a&s;&s;embled. Be&s;ides, gentlemen, if the principle which Mr. Locke again &s;tates (&s;ee book on Government, p. 236.) be ju&s;t, <Q>that the pre&s;ervation of property being the great end for which man enters &s;ociety,</Q> it nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es and requires, that the people &s;hould have pro|perty, without which they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to lo&s;e that by entering into &s;ociety, which was the end for which they entered into it; too gro&s;s an ab&s;urdity for any man to own. Men, therefore, in &s;ociety, having property, they have &s;uch a right to the goods, which by the law of the community are theirs, nobody hath a right to take their &s;ub&s;tance, or any part of it from them, without their own con&s;ent. If &s;uch then, gentlemen, is the principle which ought to regulate the intercour&s;e between man and man, in the common affairs of life, by how much more ought that principle to be ob|&s;erved by the legi&s;lature it&s;elf, to whom the mo&s;t &s;acred of all tru&s;ts has been committed, and who&s;e breach of any &s;ound and &s;alutary principle will be the more criminal, in proportion as &s;uch breach will be more exten&s;ively mi&s;chievous?</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principles of a man, who has a long time de&s;ervedly pa&s;&s;ed for one of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of rea&s;oning which England ever produced; who wrote in expre&s;s vindication of the Revolu|tion, and who, afterwards, held a place under King William (and would to God places had been always as worthily be&s;towed!) until he went to receive the final reward of his labours, from that Being
<PB N="150" REF="027591_0150_0FD54CBC0B8065A0">
who will always con&s;er it upon tho&s;e who de&s;erve it well. Gen|tlemen, it is worthy of remark, that, not only &s;peculative writers upon government, but writers upon municipal law, Sir William Black&s;tone him&s;elf, a judge, &s;hould lay down the &s;ame principle, not in expre&s;s terms indeed, but, as you will &s;ee, very &s;trongly by implication. He &s;ays, <Q>In a free &s;tate, every man who is &s;up|po&s;ed a free agent</Q> (and unle&s;s a man is incapacitated by crimes or in&s;anity, every rational being may be &s;o denominated) <Q>ought to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure <HI>his own governor.</HI></Q> <HI>See Black-Comment-octavo edition, page</HI> 158. Now, if words have any meaning, what does this e&s;tabli&s;h, but the doctrine of UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE? For I know of no other definition of liberty, than that tho&s;e who are bound by the law &s;hould have a &s;hare in the making of it, ei|ther per&s;onally, or by deputy; and no other idea of &s;lavery, than that &s;tate in which men are governed without this con&s;ent. Men who make laws for me, may indeed impudently tell me that I am free, for men may lie; but unle&s;s I have &s;ome &s;hare in the ap|pointment of tho&s;e who are to govern me, I can, in no &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid to be my own governor; but, on the contrary, have no more concern with the government of my country, than I have with tho&s;e of Turkey or Morocco. Now, if the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of this principle be nece&s;&s;ary to give government a <HI>moral right,</HI> to take a|way the <HI>property</HI> of the &s;ubject, in how far greater degree, &s;hould the &s;ame principle be ob&s;erved, as alone con&s;tituting a &s;olid ground of authority, which can empower the legi&s;lation to frame laws, for a breach of which men are to be deprived of their lives?&mdash;It has been &s;aid al&s;o that the plan of univer&s;al &s;uffrage is vi&s;ionary and impracticable. But this ob&s;ervation, if true, though it may mark the plan it&s;elf as ab&s;urd, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily di&s;charge from blame all tho&s;e who have propo&s;ed it. For a nonentity, like a phantom, is not to be dreaded, and a plan that is attended with no danger, is certainly no object of legal pro&s;ecution. No, gentlemen, our Cre|ator, I am confident, has placed every thing that is valuable, eve|ry thing that is nece&s;&s;ary for our happine&s;s, within the gra&s;p of hu|man attainment. If then we &s;hould wantonly indulge wi&s;hes, and pur&s;ue objects, which are neither proper for us, nor attainable, the true and only puni&s;hment &s;hould be (as it mu&s;t be) the fru&s;tration of our hopes, and the angui&s;h of our di&s;appointment. If like children we cry for the moon, like children we &s;hould cry on.</P>
<P>But, fortunately for me, gentlemen, my experience enables me to give a flat contradiction to the po&s;ition advanced. I my&s;elf, re&s;ided, during four years, in a country where every man, who paid taxes, had a right to vote; I mean the commonwealth of Penn&s;ylvannia. I was an eye witne&s;s of many elections which took place in Philadel|phia, the capital of the &s;tate, an indu&s;trious and populous city, and can &s;afely a&s;&s;ert, that no one riot ever en&s;ued. For, in truth, gentlemen, the repre&s;entative had no intere&s;t di&s;tinct from his con&s;tituents; the office which he undertook was rather a burthen than a benefit, and
<PB N="151" REF="027591_0151_0FD7BF3AEE01C560">
as the government was too poor to purcha&s;e, and the people too vir|tuous to barter away their liberties, (even if the ca&s;e had been other|wi&s;e) &s;o the deputy, though he had every opportunity to &s;erve, had no temptations to &s;ell his con&s;tituents. What then has been found by experience to be whole&s;ome food for Americans, can never prove hurtful or poi&s;onous to Britons, the parent &s;tock from whom Ameri|cans are de&s;cended.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am aware, that every practice and in&s;titution is a|lone defen&s;ible upon its own intrin&s;ic merits, and the rea&s;on of the thing; yet the adoption of any principle, by men eminent for virtue and learning, is certainly no &s;mall pre&s;umption of the &s;oundne&s;s of the principle it&s;elf. Gentlemen, Sir William Jones, a name too di&s;|tingui&s;hed in literature to derive &s;plendour from any encomiums I can be&s;tow upon it, and who has acted as a judge for more than twelve years in India, previou&s;ly to his departure publi&s;hed a tract in which he vindicated the doctrine of <HI>Univer&s;al Suffrage.</HI> At a very early period of my life, I was honoured with the friend&s;hip and pa|tronage of this gentleman, and I am &s;ure he would deeply feel, even after this long &s;eparation, any calamity which might befal me; a ca|lamity (if it be one), certainly, not altogether, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure, perhaps, produced by conver&s;ation with tho&s;e who&s;e practices were pure, and who&s;e principles I conceived to be ju&s;t, and who were therefore objects of reverence among men. Yet this very gentleman, at this very period, holds an office of great tru&s;t and great emolu|ment in his maje&s;ty's important &s;ettlement of Bengal, and un&s;eals tho&s;e &s;acred fountains of ju&s;tice which gladden and refre&s;h fifteen millions of men.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, having now proved to you that the principles of which I am accu&s;ed mu&s;t be, in fact, the principles of all good go|vernment, and that they have been &s;upported by the greate&s;t of all human authorities; I &s;hall now prove, I tru&s;t, equally to your &s;a|tisfaction, from incontrovertible hi&s;torical documents, that they are al&s;o congenial to the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, Monte&s;quieu has told us, that the rudiments of our excellent con&s;titution are to be &s;ought and found in the woods of Germany; where, as Tacitus informs us, <HI>all</HI> were <HI>free,</HI> and where all were entitled to deliberate upon matters of national importance. No propo&s;al could pa&s;s into a law, binding upon the people, which had not been approved by the people.</P>

<P>Gentlemen, in the earlie&s;t &s;tages of &s;ociety, when commerce was &s;carce buding, almo&s;t every inhabitant held a certain portion of land: and as land, alone in tho&s;e days, was the fund from which
<PB N="152" REF="027591_0152_0FD7BF642F287AB0">
taxes were rai&s;ed to &s;upport the expences of government, &s;o every land holder (of which de&s;cription was almo&s;t every member of the community) had a right to vote. Squire, in his view of the An|glo Saxon Government, a book of very profound re&s;earch. (Gentle|men, Squire was Archdeacon of Bath, and afterwards Bi&s;hop of St. Davids, and it is certainly no part of the Epi&s;copal function to di&s;&s;eminate &s;editious doctrines among the people) Squire tells us, the affairs of the country were, at that time, conducted by the king, the witenagemot, and the myclegemot. The witenagemot, or kings court, was an a&s;&s;embly of the be&s;t and the wi&s;e&s;t men in the nation, corre&s;ponding to what our privy council is, or (I beg pardon of our ance&s;tors) corre&s;ponding to what a privy council <HI>ought</HI> to be. The myclegemot, on the other hand, were a body cho&s;en by the <HI>people at large,</HI> corre&s;ponding to what the principles of our con&s;titution &s;uppo&s;e the parliament &s;hould be, a real repre&s;entation of the people <Q>The Witenagemot (&s;ays Squire, &s;ee p. 190) were per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed to be be&s;t acquainted with the exigencies of the public. It was their duty to <HI>propo&s;e</HI> what they thought mo&s;t expedient for the good of the <HI>whole:</HI> the new laws, e&s;pecially, &s;eem all to have been drawn up and prepared by them, though nothing which they did of this kind was obligatory to the community, until it had received the gene|ral confirmation.</Q> How was this general confirmation brought about, but by the vote of every <HI>freeman?</HI> a term applicable to all, except &s;uch as were in a &s;tate of per&s;onal &s;lavery, who upon the Norman conque&s;t were denominated villians; a &s;et of men, cor|re&s;ponding to what, your lord&s;hips well know, the civil law calls <HI>ad&s;cupti gleba;</HI> but who have cea&s;ed to exi&s;t in this country for near a century and a half, villainage being formerly aboli&s;hed by an act of parliament, pa&s;&s;ed in the early part of the reign of Charles II. As it is &s;trictly conformable to the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution, to continue all laws and cu&s;toms in <HI>favorem libertatis,</HI> &s;o per&s;onal &s;la|very being now done away, and all Briti&s;h citizens being <HI>freemen,</HI> they are of cour&s;e entitled to all tho&s;e privileges which even the ex|pre&s;s letter of our early con&s;titution conferred upon them, as de|&s;cribed, exerci&s;ed, and enjoyed, in their fulle&s;t extent.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, this was the form of government, which in a very early period prevailed; the&s;e were the principles which flouri&s;hed during the reign of the Great Alfred, than whom never lived a purer legi&s;lator; and who, Hume, in expre&s;s terms, tells us, ap|proached as nearly to human perfection as the infirmities of human nature would admit. If then, gentlemen, the&s;e doctrines are con|formable not only to the univer&s;al principles of ju&s;tice and of rea|&s;on; if they are &s;o expre&s;sly maintained by &s;o re&s;pectable an au|thority as that of Mr. Locke; if they are implicitly a&s;&s;ented to by &s;o re&s;pectable a judge as Sir William Black&s;tone, (for the words 'every man is his own governor,' mean that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they mean no|thing) if they have been publicly avowed by Sir William Jones, who, in point of learning, yields to no man to whom this kindom
<PB N="153" REF="027591_0153_0FD54CC053928B38">
has given birth, &s;ince the days of Lord Bacon; I cannot, &s;urely, be charged with innovation and a de&s;ign to di&s;turb the public peace, for having circulated principles that have long been current, and which men of &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed reputation have acquired fame in &s;upporting.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I know much non&s;en&s;e has been talked about virtual repre&s;entation: but if repre&s;entation be not real, it is no repre&s;en|tation at all. I wi&s;h to God that the &s;upporters of virtual repre|&s;entation would impo&s;e on us only virtual taxes, and inflict virtual puni&s;hments; but this they will not do: therefore, till that event, I do not think they have any right to more than virtual taxation. Gentlemen, I lay down the&s;e principles as &s;ubjects for your con&s;i|deration merely; for I hold that every inconvenience is to be borne for the pre&s;ervation of the general peace. But whenever govern|ments act directly contrary to the end for which they were in&s;ti|tuted; when, in&s;tead of being the guardians, they become the op|pre&s;&s;ors of our liberties, common &s;en&s;e, common ju&s;tice, and ex|pre&s;s law authorities, will tell us they are no longer objects of obe|dience: and this our ance&s;tors confirmed, when they e&s;tabli&s;hed the Revolution.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am not &s;o well &s;killed in the hi&s;torical antiquities of Scotland as I could wi&s;h, or, perhaps, as it was my duty to have been; but I beg you will carry this principle continually in your minds, that if &s;uch have been the privileges of England, and if this country is entitled, by the articles of union, to the &s;ame privileges, I &s;ee no offence in wi&s;hing, and attempting to effect, that Scot&s;men &s;hould be admitted to a participation of the &s;ame rights. I have, in my hand, a book of the late Dr. Stuart, who has written upon the public law and con&s;titution of Scotland, in which are &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages that favour, very much, the doctrines I have laid down, and which, at the &s;ame time, prove a &s;trong &s;imi|litude between the ancient Scotti&s;h and Engli&s;h con&s;titutions. <Q>In the body of the laws of William the Lyon, who began to reign in the year 1165, are the&s;e notices: <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;a regis Willielmi, facta apud Perth, quam epi&s;copi, abbates, comites, borones, thani, et</HI> TOTA COM|MUNITAS REGNI, <HI>tenere firmiter juraverunt.'</HI> 'An a&s;&s;ize of King William, made at Perth, which the bi&s;hops, abbots, knights, ba|rons, thanes, and <HI>the whole community of the kingdom,</HI> firmly &s;wore to maintain.' Cap. 7. And again, '&s;tatuit rex per conci|lium et a&s;&s;en&s;um <HI>TOTIUS COMMUNITATIS SUAE.'</HI> 'The king hath enacted by the advice and con&s;ent of <HI>his whole community.</HI></Q> Cap. 4. The preamble to the laws of Robert I. is al&s;o in the&s;e words <Q>habitoque &s;olemni tractatu, cum epi&s;copis, abbatibus, prioribus, comitibus baronibus, et aliis magnatibus, <HI>DE COMMUNITATE TOTI|US REGNI</HI> ibidem congregatis, &s;uper variis et arduis negotiis,' &amp;c. The con&s;titution was greatly treated of, with the bi&s;hops, priors, knights, barons, and other great per&s;onages, of <HI>the whole commu|nity
<PB N="154" REF="027591_0154_0FD7BF22EDA1FDD8">
of the kingdom,</HI> at the &s;ame time gathered together, upon va|rious and arduous affairs.' So when John Baliol told Edward I. that he '<HI>could not</HI> and <HI>dared not</HI> expre&s;s any &s;entiment which con|cerned his kingdom without con&s;ulting his people,</Q> he meant &s;ome|thing more than the &s;anction of the prelates, the nobles, and the ten|ants in capite. <HI>Ryley Placet. parl. p.</HI> 159. <HI>an.</HI> 1293. And Dr. Stuart, that profound and laborious antiquarian, po&s;itively &s;ays, that <Q>the expre&s;&s;ion of Baliol is ea&s;ily comprehended, and had a refer|ence to the whole kingdom.</Q> <HI>(See Ob&s;ervations concerning the Public Law and Con&s;titutional Hi&s;tory of Scotland, p.</HI> 334.) The expre&s;&s;ion Magnates, or <HI>great men,</HI> which is found in the &s;tatute of Robert I. that I have ju&s;t quoted, may, I am aware, be &s;uppo&s;ed to apply only to per&s;ons of higher rank, yet, upon examination, it will, I am confident, be found &s;trictly applicable to the repre&s;entation of the <HI>people,</HI> the <HI>tota communitas.</HI> For in England it appears exactly in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e; and we know, both from Rymer and Pitt, that in that kingdom, <HI>noble, mo&s;t noble mo&s;t illu&s;trious, mo&s;t precious &s;eig|nors, mon&s;eignors</HI> and <HI>&s;irs,</HI> were appellations of the <HI>Commons.</HI> Here, then, is a proof, that in the early period of the hi&s;tory of Scotland, the <HI>whole community of the kingdom, (i. e.</HI> every free man) not col|lectively, no doubt, but <HI>repre&s;entatively,</HI> were concerned in pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e laws, which they al&s;o &s;wore they would firmly maintain.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I cannot account for this coincidence between the con&s;titutional forms and principles of England and Scotland, at &s;o early a period of our hi&s;tories, without &s;uppo&s;ing that they mu&s;t be congenial to the natural order of all government it&s;elf; and that the&s;e deviations which have &s;ince been made by the ravages of time, have been the abu&s;es of the con&s;titution, and not the princi|ples of it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the third charge again&s;t me is that of having urged arguments in &s;upport of annual parliaments though I have heard from very re&s;pectable authority, no le&s;s, I believe, than one of the learned lords upon the bench, he did not conceive there was any ma|terial objection to &s;uch a mea&s;ure. He gave indeed no deci&s;ive opi|nion upon it; but he &s;eemed to think, that a mere peaceful di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject of annual parliaments would not render a man an ob|ject of criminal pro&s;ecution by the laws of this country. But I go further; I apprehend that annual parliaments may be &s;upported as well by the rea&s;on of the thing, as by ancient u&s;age; and upon this plain principle, that power long continued is too apt to corrupt the di&s;po&s;ition of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and that a people, when they intru&s;t &s;o &s;acred a charge as that of making laws, (the abu&s;e of which may work a de&s;truction of their lives, and the ruin of their property) can|not be too vigilant in ob&s;erving the conduct of tho&s;e to whom they delegate this tru&s;t, nor too quick in recalling them whenever they abu&s;e it. By long parliaments we lo&s;e the great advantage which our con|&s;titution has provided, of curing the evil, before it grows confirmed and de&s;perate, by the gentle method of choo&s;ing a new repre&s;entative;
<PB N="155" REF="027591_0155_0FD7BF672D7CAB28">
and the <HI>people</HI> are by con&s;equence reduced to have no other alternative, than that of &s;ubmitting or re&s;i&s;ting; though &s;ubmitting will be as grievous, and re&s;i&s;tance much more difficult, when the <HI>legi&s;lature</HI> be|trays its tru&s;t, than when the <HI>king</HI> alone abu&s;es his power, Be|&s;ides, &s;hort parliaments, &s;hould they become &s;uddenly corrupt, carry with them their own corrective; for, <Q>leeches, and other blood-&s;ucking worms, as Davenant well ob&s;erves, are engendered in &s;tanding pools; flowing waters do not corrupt nor breed &s;o many in&s;ects.</Q></P>
<P>It is a melancholy fact, but it is a very certain one, that parlia|ments have generally been dangerous in proportion as they have been long.</P>
<P>The long parliament (peculiarly &s;o denominated on account of the length of time which they &s;at) that &s;at in the reign of Charles I. I believe were pretty in&s;trumental in bringing the head of that unfortunate monarch to the block. I cannot therefore believe, that long parliaments can be &s;upported by gentlemen, who avow, that their intention is to defend monarchical principles; when a parliament was that which overturned the monarchy, and behead|ed the &s;overeign. The Hou&s;e of Commons which &s;at for &s;o long a time in the reign of Charles II. were &s;o notorious for their pro|fligacy, that Rapin a&s;&s;ures us, one half of them were bribed by the court of France, probably, the other half by our own.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am well aware that it may be &s;aid, that if elections were more frequent, greater tumults would en&s;ue. I apprehend the rever&s;e of this po&s;ition is exactly the truth; for, it might be worth the while of a member of parliament to get elected under the corrupt influence of the Mini&s;ter, when he is in for &s;even years though not when he is in only for one; for, knowing that he mu&s;t, at the end of a year give an account to his con&s;tituents, he would take greater care how he executed the important tru&s;ts committed to him, than if he was delegated for a large time. If then, gentlemen, the object of getting into parliament would not be &s;uch as to make it a &s;tronger inducement for per&s;on's, in gene|ral, to become members, of cour&s;e tumults would not &s;o frequently en&s;ue at general elections as, to our misfortune and di&s;grace, they do under the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;In &s;upport of this doctrine of annu|al parliaments, I am fortified by the authority of a gentleman, who is and who has long been, a member of the Hou&s;e of Commons, I mean Mr. Alderman Sawbridge, who, wearied out, at la&s;t, by continual di&s;appointments, has abandoned his project, not from conviction, but de&s;pair. The trea&s;ury bench, indeed, <HI>&s;olito more,</HI> "according to cu&s;tom," never made Alderman Sawbridge's propo|&s;al the &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; but, as often as the motion was made, coolly negatived it, by the <HI>dead eloquence</HI> of numbers.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, parliaments you mu&s;t recollect, were annual, till the time of Henry VIII. He was the fir&s;t who broke in upon the cu&s;tom of annual parliaments; and he, I tru&s;t, will never
<PB N="156" REF="027591_0156_0FD54CC3E8C1BB28">
brought forward as an authority as he was a <HI>mon&s;ter</HI> of whom it was, emphatically &s;aid, <Q>that he &s;pared no man in his wrath, nor woman in his lu&s;t;</Q> and, who di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf during a long and a bloody reign, by oppre&s;&s;ing his &s;ubjects, and beheading his wives. Be&s;ides, gentlemen, as the great object of the SOCIAL INSTITUTION is to call forth, to their fulle&s;t excition, the aggre|gate faculties of all tho&s;e who are members of it, for the purpo&s;e of producing the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;um of happine&s;s; &s;o, if this cu&s;tom of annual parliaments were revived (for they are not inno|vations) it would introduce many more into public bu&s;ine&s;s, who are now excluded from it, and who&s;e minds being inflamed and in|vigorated with a love of glory, and a pa&s;&s;ion for promoting the public weal, would rou&s;e them&s;elves from that &s;upinene&s;s which invites oppre&s;&s;ion, and which is too often the bane and de&s;truction of nations. For, under the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, many per&s;ons having &s;carcely any concern with the government, except as they are call|ed to &s;upport it by the payment of taxes, they either grow carele&s;s and indifferent about the mea&s;ure which it adopts, or &s;eek to better their condition by recour&s;e to violence.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it appears that &s;uch al&s;o was the law of Scotland; for I find by a &s;tatute pa&s;&s;ed in the 1&s;t parliament of James VI. in the year 1587, <Q>it is ordained, that the commi&s;&s;ioners of all the &s;chir|reffdomes of this realme be elected be the freehalders fore&s;aids, at the fir&s;t head court after Michaelmas <HI>zeirly.</HI></Q> It is, therefore, no new doctrine in Scotland any more than it is England. And I find by an article of the <HI>Claim of Rights</HI> that the Old Scotti&s;h Con|&s;titution was to be re&s;tored; which claim of rights certainly took place after the pa&s;&s;ing of that act, and which act con&s;titutes an e&s;&s;en|tial branch of the &s;cotti&s;h Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>A very eminent writer, gentlemen, upon annual parliaments, be|gins his book with this very remarkable ob&s;ervation, <Q>where annual election ends, &s;lavery begins.</Q> And he &s;tates preci&s;ely the rea&s;ons that I have &s;tated to you, that if power, continues long in the &s;ame hands, it has a tendency to corrupt, and that it &s;hould not only be de|legated for the benefit of tho&s;e over whom it is exerci&s;ed, but, that it &s;hould al&s;o be delegated in &s;uch a manner as to prevent any <HI>perma|ment,</HI> if not <HI>immediate</HI> abu&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I now come to the period of the Revolution, an e|vent which e&s;tabli&s;hed our con&s;titution, (it is &s;aid) a con&s;titution, however, which weak men, I fear, prai&s;e without under&s;tanding, and which wicked men violate while they prai&s;e. The Engli&s;h de|legates have been charged with an intention of having come to this country, for the purpo&s;e of de&s;troying tho&s;e advantages and benefits which the &s;ubjects of the two united kingdoms derived from that glorious event. If the charge could be brought home to us, it would not be merely a tran&s;portation to Botany Bay, which ought to be our &s;ate, but an execution at the gallows. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> charge is totally unfounded, and I am &s;urpri&s;ed that it has been

brought forward by per&s;ons in particular &s;ituations; &s;ince that charge, like many others, will, upon examination, recoil on the heads of tho&s;e who made it. I will &s;hew you, gentlemen, that the benefits of the Revolution have been done away, but not by us; for it was our purpo&s;e to revive them. Has it not been prov|ed, by Mr. Wharton, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, in a &s;peech to which no an&s;wer was given, that not one &s;ingle ve&s;tige remains of the whole&s;ome regulations which the Revolution produced. I know that it is treading over beaten ground; but, I tru&s;t, you will not think your time u&s;ele&s;sly con&s;umed, when it goes to e&s;tabli&s;h a point, upon which my guilt or innocence materially depends. I &s;hall now read to you extracts from a pamphlet, of which I am not a&s;hamed to avow my&s;elf the author, entitled "addre&s;s of the Bri|ti&s;h Convention to the people of Great Britain," and which was drawn up by me at their expre&s;s direction: "The &s;pirit of Al|fred again ro&s;e to animate the councils of his regenerated country. Scotland, which had long groaned under the domination of an au&s;tere and in&s;olent ari&s;tocracy, was called in to &s;hare with her brethren of England, the ble&s;&s;ings of freedom, which &s;he had con|tributed to produce. Placemen and pen&s;ioners were excluded <HI>by law</HI> from the Hou&s;e of Commons, le&s;t a &s;en&s;e of their dependance on the crown &s;hould, as it mu&s;t, make them forgetful of their duty to the people. Parliaments were not to &s;it for more than three years, &s;ince power long continued is commonly abu&s;ed, as tho&s;e entru&s;ted with it, are too prone to forget the hand which gave, and the pur|po&s;e for which it was given. Mini&s;ters were made an&s;werable for the coun&s;els which they afforded, and the throne, now guarded by the vigilance, and &s;u&s;tained by the love of all its &s;ubjects, was no longer a &s;anctuary for the treachery of its &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Friends and countrymen, the&s;e wi&s;e and whole&s;ome provi&s;ions, which were once the boa&s;t and &s;ecurity of Britons, now form o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y an object of melancholy remembrance. They are buried in the &s;ame &s;epulchre with the bodies of our ance&s;tors. In many parliaments, which have &s;itten &s;ince the Revolution, placemen and pen&s;ioners have been &s;o numerous, as to controul the will, while they violat|ed the rights of the people. Since that time, parliaments have more than doubled the term of their duration, not by an appeal to the voice of their electors, but by the arbitrary effort of a &s;elf con|&s;tituted authority. Judging from this &s;pecimen, and drawing the natural inference, that what <HI>has</HI> been done <HI>may</HI> be done again, we know of no barrier or &s;ecurity, at pre&s;ent exi&s;ting, to prevent a future parliament from enlarging the term of their duration to twenty years, or, if it &s;uits their intere&s;t or ambition, from declaring them&s;elves perpetual. The re&s;pon&s;ibility of mini&s;ters has become an empty name. Crimes, which during former pe|riods, would have called down upon the heads of their guilty au|thors the ju&s;t vengeance of an injured nation, have been only a pa&s;&s;|port to opulence and power. The people of Britain have &s;een
<PB N="158" REF="027591_0158_0FD54CC6E23E53B0">
the very mini&s;ters who di&s;membered the empire, &s;quandered a hundred millions of money, and poured out the bloud of more than a hundred thou&s;and of their fellow-&s;ubjects in a cruel and de&s;perate conte&s;t, again recalled into the confidence of their &s;overeign, and loaded with the honors and emoluments of the em|pire.</P>
<P>Thus you behold, that the &s;pirit of tho&s;e regulations, which the Revolution produced, is fled, and what remains is only the dead carca&s;e which encumbeas the &s;tatute book. We now a&s;k, who are tho&s;e, that are guilty of innovation? Is it that band of hirelings, to whom coruption is food, or is it we, who wi&s;h only to re&s;tore the principles of our Saxon ance&s;tors, which gave us freedom, and that &s;acred compact which confirmed it at the Revolution? If the foun|dations of the throne are &s;haken, are they &s;haken by us, who &s;eek only to replace it on tho&s;e &s;olid grounds, on which it was originally erected; or, are not they rather &s;haken by tho&s;e who, with hollow profe&s;&s;ions of loyalty in their mouths, have &s;ought to e&s;tabli&s;h the authority of the crown, by the renovation of tho&s;e practices which bani&s;hed the Stuarts, and by the violation of tho&s;e principles which elevated the Brun&s;wicks? We cheri&s;h the con&s;titution of our ance&s;|tors, not as a &s;peculative bauble, but as a practical good, and we contra&s;t, with an hone&s;t pride, our own &s;incere admiration of that &s;y&s;tem, with the fawning treachery of its real foes&mdash;of men, who&s;e prai&s;e is profanation, and who&s;e external homage is concealed bla&s;|phemy."</P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding, the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of government is a libel upon our real con&s;titution; the word <HI>con&s;titution, con&s;titution!</HI> is rung in our ears with uncea&s;ing per&s;everance. This is the <HI>tali&s;|man</HI> which the enemies of reform wield over the heads of the cre|dulous and the &s;imple; and, like old and wicked enchanters, hav|ing fir&s;t bound them in the &s;pell, take advantage of the drow&s;ine&s;s which their arts have created. But to hear placemen and pen|&s;ioners talking of a con&s;titution, when their whole lives are one uniform violation of its principles is, like a monk preaching po|pulation, or a farmer general commi&s;erating the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, there is one particular error, into which all tho&s;e who have enumerated the regulations which took place at the Revo|lution have fallen, and of which, until a few days pa&s;t, I my&s;elf was not con&s;cious. Having no other object but truth, I beg leave to &s;tate it to you. The bill for excluding placemen and pen&s;ioners, though it pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of King William, was not to take effect until the acce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Hanover. In the intermediate period, in|deed, that act was repealed; but does not the pa&s;&s;ing of the act, at the period of the revolution, clearly prove that we are entitled to its revival, now, when the hou&s;e of Hanover is &s;itting on the throne, in con&s;equence of that very revolution; and when it may be &s;afely in|ferred,
<PB N="159" REF="027591_0159_0FD54CC8A624A9E8">
that the act alluded to, and their compliance with its principles, was made a condition of their &s;ub&s;equent elevation?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the public pro&s;ecutor has, in vague and general terms, charged me with an intention of overturning the con&s;titution; but I now call upon him in terms particular and preci&s;e, to declare whether the &s;y&s;tem under which he acts has not rooted out every valuable principle, every whole&s;ome regulation, which the revolution produc|ed; whether tho&s;e regulations are a living &s;pirit, or a dead letter; whether placemen and pen&s;ioners do not now &s;warm around the trea|&s;ury bench, like vermin on the banks of the Nile. And even when, by a mockery of our under&s;tandings, they vacate their &s;eats, for a &s;hort time, for what is called the Chiltern Hundreds, are they not again re-elected?&mdash;elected did I &s;ay? No! again nominated by the peer who originally &s;ent them, in a manner as peremptory as the king, by his Conge d'Elire, nominates a bi&s;hop! This, gentlemen, is not idle declamation; it is &s;olid fact, and incontrovertible proof. I therefore call upon you, my countrymen, in your turn, and a&s;k you, how you can con&s;cientiou&s;ly lay your hands upon your hearts, and &s;olemnly declare, before God and the world, that I have attempted to overturn a &s;y&s;tem, of which it has been proved to you not a ve&s;tige remains? Do you not know, that tho&s;e who in&s;tigated this pro&s;ecu|tion, when called upon to revi&s;e the&s;e principles of the con&s;titution, as they could not an&s;wer the arguments of the patriot Wharton, pre|&s;erved a &s;ullen and criminal &s;ilence? What then mu&s;t you think of a &s;tate pro&s;ecution, which re&s;ts for &s;upport on &s;o &s;andy a foundation; or what rather mu&s;t you not think of the conduct of tho&s;e men, who, while they are heaping upon my devoted head the charges of trea|&s;ons, con&s;piracies, and &s;edition, can give the real &s;candal of &s;o noto|rious and wilful an in&s;incerity?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the triennial bill has long been repealed: but why not now revive it;&mdash;&s;ince the rea&s;on on which it was repealed has long &s;ince cea&s;ed? For, if you will take the trouble, gentlemen, of looking at the parliamentary debates of that period, not even the ranke&s;t mini&s;terial hireling attempted to defend the mea&s;ure, upon any other principle than that of temporary expediency; as it was thought un&s;afe to expo&s;e the country to the tumult of a gene|neral election, when a rebellion was raging in the heart of the kingdom. But now it &s;eems, the &s;eptennial bill has become as much a part of our government, as the malt-tax, the mutiny-bill, and a &s;tanding army; which when fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, it was declared, were only to be temporary, and, like the &s;eptennial bill, were only &s;ub|mitted to on the fatal plea of a &s;tate nece&s;&s;ity. "The re&s;pon&s;ibi|lity of mini&s;ters, it is &s;tated, has become an empty name." Would to God it were fal&s;e; but is not the fact as melancholy as it is true? Do not tho&s;e mini&s;ters who conducted the American war (an event which &s;hook the&s;e kingdoms to their deepe&s;t foundation) conduct the pre&s;ent war? Did not Lord North, who was prime mini&s;ter during the whole of the war, enjoy, for many years after the war was end|ed,
<PB N="160" REF="027591_0160_0FD7BF3F6D8A0138">
a &s;inecure place of 5000l. a year (now indeed devolved upon Mr. Pitt?) And do not his family, at this very hour, receive from the country a con&s;iderable income, granted during their father's mini&s;try, by way of rever&s;ion, though I could never learn that they have earned it by their &s;ervices?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the right of our meeting in convention by <HI>delegation</HI> has been expre&s;sly, denied by the Solicitor General, and he, (I am &s;ure if I mi&s;take his meaning, it is not purpo&s;ely, and I beg he will interrupt me) I think he denied our right to meet by delegation.&mdash; Had we met as the united delegates of all Britain, we &s;hould have arrogated a title to which we had no right. But we did no &s;uch thing: we met, only, as the repre&s;entatives of &s;ome thou&s;ands, who delegated us for a purpo&s;e which we knew to be con&s;titutional; and we conducted our&s;elves in a manner firm, but peaceable.</P>
<P>If, in the common concerns of life, a man can receive a power of attorney to manage, the pecuniary concerns of another; &s;o, I tru&s;t, he is authori&s;ed to carry into execution, for the benefit of his fellow-creatures, affairs of a much greater concernment; otherwi&s;e you de|ny him, in fact, that privilege, without which all others are nugato|ry, I mean the e&s;&s;ential privilege of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. I am happy, however, that the charge is brought forward, as a ground of crimi|nality; ina&s;much as the meeting, which delegated us, was publicly held in an open field, in the face of day, in the pre&s;ence of many thou&s;ands of our fellow citizens, who were calm and attentive &s;pec|tators of what was pa&s;&s;ing, and in the pre&s;ence, even, of five hundred peace-officers, &s;ome of whom were members of our a&s;&s;ociation, and others &s;ent, by the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, to watch over our proceedings and to make their report. Of the latter, I can a&s;&s;ert from my own per&s;onal knowledge, many became converts to our doctrines; which, as they were founded in rea&s;on, and have no other object than the general welfare of mankind, mu&s;t make converts of all who have not an intere&s;t in oppo&s;ing what it is their duty to practi&s;e. All the&s;e things, gentlemen, were &s;uffered to pa&s;s, under the eye of the police, under the very beard, if I may &s;ay &s;o, of the &s;ecretary of &s;tate him|&s;elf, who is, <HI>ex officio,</HI> the great con&s;ervator of the public peace; and in the very heart of the capital of our country, which is, or which ought to be, the great &s;anctuary of the law.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the publicity of our conduct was certainly a proof that <HI>we</HI> deemed it to be innocent. And if the officers of &s;tate deemed it to be otherwi&s;e, upon what principle can you excu&s;e their &s;upinene&s;s and inactivity in not di&s;per&s;ing the meeting, and taking up the dele|gates, &s;ince to <HI>prevent</HI> crimes is far better than to <HI>puni&s;h</HI> them, and far more the duty of the civil magi&s;tracy, unle&s;s, in the pride and haughtine&s;s of their hearts, they &s;ought to cheri&s;h the &s;eeds of a &s;tate pro&s;ecution again&s;t men whom they had marked out as the victims of their re&s;entment? Their conduct, then, we can only look on as TRAPS TO ENSNARE US. Gentlemen, if what I have &s;tated be well founded, we are entitled to draw the&s;e melancholy inferences; that
<PB N="161" REF="027591_0161_0FD54CCC25F721A8">
the articles of the Union are violated in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and that there is not, as the fourth article avers there &s;hall be, <Q>a communication of all rights and privileges between the &s;ubjects of both kingdoms;</Q> &s;ince a man may commit, with impunity, on the other &s;ide of the Tweed, what, if he cro&s;&s;es it, he &s;hall be tran&s;ported for; that an unity of the principles of action, an equal and undi&s;tingui&s;hing law, operating, either to the puni&s;hment or &s;ecurity of all citizens alike (and which is the great badge of freemen) does not prevail among us; but that the code of the two countries is an heterogeneous ma&s;s, like Nebuchadnezzar's image, made up, partly of clay, and partly of bra&s;s. The&s;e facts, it would be like burning day light to prove, and he that runs may read them.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the great and di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of men is rea&s;on. If we are debarred from the privilege of exerci&s;ing this invaluable fa|culty, we are reduced to a &s;ituation (I will not &s;ay on a level with the bea&s;ts of the field, for many of them, like our&s;elves, are &s;ocial and gregarious, and have the power) from the exerci&s;e of which the laws of this country has not as yet debarred them (of communicating their ideas, though not indeed by articulate &s;ounds) if we are debar|red from this privilege, then, I &s;ay, we are reduced even lower than the brutes, and put upon a level with oy&s;ters and other &s;hell-fi&s;h, who&s;e powers of motion are limited to gape and receive, what the bounty of nature, unlike that of the governments of the earth, which rather take than give, confers for their &s;upport. The con&s;tant theme of the &s;upporters of government is the excellence of the Bri|ti&s;h Con&s;titution. Willing as we are to admit the po&s;ition, it is cer|tainly not unrea&s;onable to a&s;k how is this excellence to be a&s;certain|ed. It is &s;urely not a matter of in&s;tinct; con&s;equently, can only be a&s;certained by the exerci&s;e of our rea&s;on. If you deny us this privi|lege, or, what is nearly the &s;ame, puni&s;h us for the u&s;e of it, your government, I aver, &s;tands preci&s;ely upon the &s;ame foundation as the governments of Turkey and Algiers; for the Viziers, the Ba&s;haws, and other &s;tate officers of tho&s;e arbitrary governments, &s;o long as they are enjoying their &s;alaries, and fleecing the people, will a&s;&s;ert, no doubt, with equal confidence, that tho&s;e governments are the be&s;t, and that all attempts to examine, or controvert by rea&s;on, the principles on which they are founded, are highly &s;editious, have a tendency to di&s;turb the public peace, and are, therefore de&s;erving of the puni&s;hment of the law. If you interdict the free u&s;e of our rea|&s;oning faculties on matters of government (and they do no more) you and they are exactly on a par; and if you do not, the di&s;pute between us is at an end, as you concede the very point for which we are contending.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is a very melancholy con&s;ideration in the pre&s;ent times, and it is with a mixture of grief and a&s;toni&s;hment I &s;peak it, that the very &s;ame kind of arguments, which at the dawn of the Reformation were made u&s;e of by the Catholic clergy, who were
<PB N="162" REF="027591_0162_0FD7BF426D8F5098">
endeavouring to hold the people in the fetters of &s;uper&s;tition, are now made u&s;e of by tho&s;e very per&s;ons, who, for purpo&s;es equally &s;elfi&s;h, are repre&s;&s;ing the progre&s;s of political information. Cardinal Bellarmine, a man eminent for learning, but vehement in his oppo|&s;ition of religious reformation, declaims, particularly again&s;t the im|pious attempts to diffu&s;e knowledge among the lower cla&s;&s;es; and to lay open the <HI>Holy Scriptures to vulgar eyes.</HI> Religion in tho&s;e days, it &s;eems, like government in the pre&s;ent, was to be believed and confided in without being examined. Oh! Prepo&s;terous in&s;ult to the dignity of human rea&s;on! Oh, Bla&s;phemy again&s;t the author of all goodne&s;s! As if the parent of knowledge were capable of giving a revelation to his creatures, to be adopted for ages by milli|ons of rea&s;onable beings, that would not &s;tand the te&s;t of human en|quiry! The true religion, like all free governments, appeals to the under&s;tanding for its &s;upport and not to the &s;word. All &s;y&s;tems, whether civil or moral, can only be durable in proportion as they are founded on truth, and calculated to promote the GOOD OF MAN|KIND. This will account to us, why governments &s;uited to the great energies of man, have always outlived the peri&s;hable things which de&s;poti&s;m has erected. Yes! this will account to us, why the foul &s;tream of prejudice and calumny, which is continually wa&s;hing the di&s;&s;oluble fabrics of all &s;uper&s;titious impo&s;tures, pa&s;&s;es without in|jury, by the adamant of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, gentlemen, that in our days, the great champion of de&s;poti&s;m has not &s;crupled to borrow his favourite phra&s;e from a monki&s;h writer, who was an enemy to the Reforma|tion: Knighton, an abbot of Leice&s;ter, who wrote at the beginning of the Reformation, when he is deploring the publication of the Scriptures to the common people, has this remarkable expre&s;&s;ion, <Q>Pity it is, that this evangelical pearl &s;hould be trodden down under the foot of <HI>&s;wine.</HI></Q> Mr. Burke laments, that <Q>learning &s;hould be trodden down under the hoof of the &s;wini&s;h multitude.</Q> In ju&s;tice to the mouldering monk, I mu&s;t however ob&s;erve, that the expre&s;&s;ion con&s;idered merely as an expre&s;&s;ion is truly beautiful; whereas, Mr. Burke's phra&s;eology is as de&s;titute of ta&s;te and congruity as it is de|void of benevolence.</P>
<P>But, gentlemen, if you take the principle of the thing, you will find that every nation has a right, not only to pre&s;erve the form of go|vernment which is actually e&s;tabli&s;hed; but, al&s;o, by the peaceful and calm operation of rea&s;on, to improve that form of government, what|ever it may be. If you deny this po&s;ition, you mu&s;t &s;ay, that our ance&s;tors had a privilege which we have not a right to exerci&s;e: an ab&s;urdity too gro&s;s to de&s;erve a &s;erious refutation; &s;ince all men be|ing born equally with the &s;ame rights, through every &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, no generation can annihilate or curtail the rights of a &s;ub&s;e|quent one. The <HI>moral</HI> right, indeed, of altering any goverement mu&s;t always depend upon the particular circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, but the ab&s;tract right is always ve&s;ted in the PEOPLE; of the moral
<PB N="163" REF="027591_0163_0FD7BF68AD7CBAC8">
exerci&s;e of which (however they may occa&s;ionally abu&s;e it) they mu&s;t be, and they are, the proper and ultimate judges. What, therefore, the Solicitor General has &s;aid, that we have, now, <HI>no right</HI> to frame or alter the con&s;titution, but that it is our duty im|plicitly to obey it, &s;ince it was e&s;tabli&s;hed at the Revolution, and tran&s;mitted to us by our ance&s;tors, I deny to be &s;ound rea&s;on, or &s;alu|tary political doctrine. In adopting this po&s;ition, I am fortified by the authority of Algernon Sydney, than whom a purer &s;pirit never appeared before the tribunal of his maker; <Q>Laws and con&s;titutions (&s;ays he) ought to be weighed, and whil&s;t all due reverence is paid to &s;uch as are good, every nation may not only retain in it. &s;elf a power of changing or aboli&s;hing all &s;uch as are not &s;o, but ought to exerci&s;e that power according to the be&s;t of their under|&s;tanding, and in the place of what was either at fir&s;t mi&s;taken, or afterwards corrupted to con&s;titute that which is mo&s;t conducive to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Ju&s;tice and Liberty. But &s;uch is the condition of mankind, that nothing can be &s;o perfectly framed as not to &s;hew &s;ome te&s;timony of human imbecillity, and frequently to &s;tand in need of reparation and amendments. Many things are un|known to the wi&s;e&s;t, and the be&s;t men can never wholly dive&s;t them&s;elves of pa&s;&s;ions and affections. By the&s;e means, the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t are &s;ometimes led into error, and &s;tand in need of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion like to them&s;elves, who may find remedies for the faults they have committed; <HI>and nothing can or ought to be permanent but that which is perfect.</HI> No natural body was ever &s;o well tempered and organized, as not to be &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;es, wounds, or other acci|dents, and to need medicines, and other occa&s;ional helps, as well as nouri&s;hment and exerci&s;e; and he who, under the name of <HI>inno|vation,</HI> would deprive nations of the like, does as much as lies in him, condemn them all to peri&s;h by the defects of their own foun|dations. Some men ob&s;erving this, have propo&s;ed a nece&s;&s;ity of reducing every &s;tate, once in an age or two, to the integrity of its fir&s;t principles: but they ought to have examined, whether that principle be good or evil, or &s;o good that nothing can be ever add|ed to it, which none ever was; and this being &s;o, tho&s;e who will admit of no change would render errors perpetual, and depriving mankind of the benefits of wi&s;dom, indu&s;try, experience, and the right u&s;e of rea&s;on, oblige all to continue in the mi&s;erable barba|rity of their ance&s;tors, WATCH SUITS BETTER WITH THE NATURE OF A WOLF THAN THAT OF A MAN.</Q> Sydney on Government, quarto edit. p. 405.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, we all know that the human mind is &s;uffered to be ac|tive in the improvement of tho&s;e civil arts, which conduce to the comfort and happine&s;s of human life, I mean the mechanical arts; and &s;hall the grand art of all, that of making men &s;ecure in the en|joyment of their acqui&s;itions. I mean the art of government, be alone neglected, alone compelled to be &s;tationary? But abandoning the principle and rea&s;on of the ca&s;es, the facts them&s;elves contradict the
<PB N="164" REF="027591_0164_0FD7BF40EDA33270">
a&s;&s;ertions of our adver&s;aries. Our con&s;titution has never been &s;tati|onary. It has been in a gradual &s;tate of improvement; and a wri|ter to whom this country had the honour of giving birth, I mean Hume, expre&s;sly tells us, that the hi&s;tory of England is little el&s;e "than a hi&s;tory of rever&s;als." Do we not know that the acts of parliament are frequently &s;et a&s;ide, and others directly contrary pa&s;&s;|ed in their &s;tead? By the treaty of Troyes, after the battle of Agin|court, which was regularly ratified and confirmed, and no oppo&s;ition made to it, either by France or England, the two kingdoms were for ever unrepealably united under Henry V. Where is now the un|repealable union between England and France? Oaths were heaped upon oaths to bind the nobility of England never to violate any of the con&s;titutions of Richard II. as Rapin a&s;&s;ures us (vol. 1. p. 245.) where are his con&s;titutions now? During three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive reigns, the national religion was three times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively changed by act of parli|ament. A more compleat tyranny cannot be conceived than Willi|am the Conqueror e&s;tabli&s;hed over the people of England. Yet but a few reigns pa&s;s away, and the barons e&s;tabli&s;h a legal right to re|dre&s;s their grievances by FORCE. Magna Charta &s;ays, <Q>De&s;tring-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> et gravabunt nos,</Q> &amp;c. The barons complaining and failing of redre&s;s, &s;hall lawfully di&s;tre&s;s and aggrieve the king all manner of ways, as by taking his ca&s;tles, land po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &amp;c. till redre&s;s is granted. After the re&s;toration comes the corporation act, and de|clares all re&s;i&s;tance unlawful. The &s;ame doctrine is preached in the act of attainder, and militia acts. Nor thirty years after this comes the Revolution, and aboli&s;hes the whole &s;y&s;tem of pa&s;&s;ive-obedience, and non-re&s;i&s;tance; &s;ends the whole royal family a packing, and brings in the hou&s;e of Na&s;&s;au. The liberty of the pre&s;s was taken away by the 13th Charles II. The liberty of petitioning was abo|li&s;hed the &s;ame year; and then the corporation charters were taken away. All the&s;e were re&s;tored by the Bill of Rights. Do not then, gentlemen, the&s;e facts prove Mr. Hume's words, <Q>That the hi&s;tory of England is little better than a hi&s;tory of rever&s;als.</Q> There are &s;ome men, I know, who &s;ee a &s;pectre in every bu&s;h. Lord Not|tingham, when the Union was in agitation, declared that the chang|ing of the term England to that of Great Britain would &s;ubvert all the laws of England. And in our own days there are of the &s;ame de&s;cription of men of whom we may &s;ay, that the word innovation, to u&s;e Mortimer's expre&s;&s;ion, <Q>has frozen up their &s;ouls, like fi&s;h in a pond.</Q> After all, the mo&s;t u&s;eful di&s;coveries in philo&s;ophy, the mo&s;t important changes in the moral hi&s;tory of Man, have been inno|vations. The Revolution was an innovation; the Reformation was an innovation; Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf was an innovation.</P>

at the Revolution, when the forms of civil government and the liber|ties of the &s;ubject were done away by the infringement of all law; or with that period, in which the &s;overeign is &s;aid to have forfeited his life! I cannot &s;it here without ob&s;erving as was done in England, in the year 1745, when the rebels were tried; I cannot &s;it here, as a judge and as a man, without &s;aying that it is a mo&s;t indecent defence. It is my duty to ob&s;erve this; but I am for the pannel going on in his own way.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> I conceive my&s;elf as vindicating the rights of Bri|tons at large; and I &s;olemnly di&s;claim all intention of attacking Chri|&s;tianity. I was merely &s;tating the fact.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Go on in your own way.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> I think I may be allowed that at lea&s;t.</P>

<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> I &s;hould have been going on if your lord&s;hip had not interrupted me.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the great charge again&s;t me is, that I came down here for the purpo&s;e of carrying on reform; and if I am not allowed to go into a vindication of the&s;e general principles, and an enumeration of particular abu&s;es, I may be condemned indeed, but I certainly am not heard. I was only arguing that the &s;uppo&s;ed principles charged upon me were &s;uch as have been adopted by the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of men; and if they can &s;hew me, from higher authority, that they are uncon&s;titutional, I would in&s;tantly become a convert to their doc|trines; but rea&s;on alone, and not a&s;&s;ertion, can convert me. I &s;hall now endeavour to prove to you that our object was perfectly con|&s;titutional.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, by a return of the repre&s;entation in parliament, an object which we feel equally intere&s;ted in with all other Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects, given us by a &s;ociety called the Friends of the People, many of whom are members of Parliament, and, among others, the illu&s;trious Sheridan, (the brilliancy of who&s;e talents can only be equalled by his di&s;intere&s;ted attachment to the liberties of his country) it appears that in England 2611 per&s;ons&mdash;return to parliament 327 members, and in Scotland 98 per&s;ons elect 15, and the remaining 30 are elected by about 1400.</P>
<P>This is not an adequate repre&s;entation; but a mockery of repre|&s;entation; and therefore not &s;uch a repre&s;entation as the original principles of our con&s;titution intended, or as the Revolution was meant to promote. Surely, gentlemen, it is not the &s;emblance of a parlia|ment that we want, not the more <HI>name</HI> of a parliament, the <HI>magi&s;|tratuum vocabula,</HI> as Tacitus well expre&s;&s;es it; but &s;uch a parliament as &s;hall pre&s;erve our intere&s;ts, and expre&s;s our wills. If the court's governing without a parliament was formerly the object of our ter|ror; if its governing <HI>with</HI> a parliament is as ju&s;tly the object of our wi&s;hes; its governing <HI>by</HI> a parliament is an infallible method, not only to compa&s;s, but give &s;anction to our ruin. With regard to the fir&s;t of the&s;e governments, our terrors have long &s;lumbered; for,
<PB N="166" REF="027591_0166_0FD54CD3DE20C8A8">
while we &s;o fully give, why &s;hould the &s;overeign take? But if ever the period &s;hould arrive, when the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;hould inva|riably an&s;wer to the calls of the crown, though they &s;hould be deaf to the cries of the people; that they &s;hould purcha&s;e on the one hand, only to &s;ell on the other; that in&s;tead of redre&s;&s;ing grievances they &s;hould authori&s;e them; in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting malefactors, they &s;hould &s;creen them; in&s;tead of protecting and defending the rights of their con&s;tituents, they &s;hould perfidiou&s;ly betray them; if ever &s;uch a period &s;hould arrive, I &s;ay, we might &s;till amu&s;e our&s;elves with the word con&s;titution; but hope it&s;elf would &s;icken, as the con&s;titution, in fact, mu&s;t be every where undermined, and at the fir&s;t &s;ound of the trum|pet of de&s;poti&s;m, like the walls of Jericho, would &s;ink into a heap of ruins.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I was not drawing any parallel, when the bench in|terrupted me, between the &s;tate of this country at this time, and the &s;tate of it at the Revolution; but, I was laying down a principle, that if per&s;ons in any given period had a right to meet for the pur|po&s;e of bettering their government, they had the &s;ame right at e|very &s;ub&s;equent period. The Revolution was carried into effect by open <HI>force,</HI> but here there was no idea of force, which I tru&s;t, I &s;hall be able to prove. In our meetings there was no idea of any force at all, and therefore, in&s;tead of drawing a parallel be|tween the &s;ituation of the country at that time, and at this, or of inculcating the propriety of having recour&s;e to force, we were doing directly the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;hall now briefly examine the principles, which the report of my &s;peeches in the convention attributes to me. It is there &s;tated, that I &s;aid <Q>no meeting of the people can be called a mob, if their deliberations be directed towards the public good; but if men meet for an oppo&s;ite purpo&s;e, for promoting the mi|&s;ery or the de&s;truction of the human race, though they &s;it down with crowns on their heads and &s;ceptres in their hands, they are truly a mob.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e, gentlemen, I hold to be moral and &s;elf-evident propo&s;itions; that it is not the <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> but the <HI>ju&s;t exerci&s;e</HI> of power, which &s;hould render it an object of reverence among men; and that the e&s;&s;ential principles of vice and virtue are not altered by the practices of per&s;ons in high &s;tations&mdash;<Q><HI>Promota ju&s;titia</HI> (&s;ays, St. Au&s;tin) <HI>quid &s;unt regna ni&s;i magna latrocinia?</HI></Q> 'If ju&s;tice were laid a&s;ide,' as this venerable father has well &s;aid, <Q>the governments of the world would re&s;emble dens of robbers; and men would follow only tho&s;e who can inflict the greate&s;t puni&s;hments, or give the greate&s;t rewards;</Q> but &s;ince the reception of &s;uch opinions would be the extirpation of all that can be called good, we mu&s;t look for another rule of our obedience; and we &s;hall find that only to be the law, (I mean that Tully calls the <HI>&s;anctio rectua)</HI> which being founded upon what eternal principle of rea&s;on and truh, whence the rule of ju&s;tice, which is &s;acred and pure, ought to be reduced,
<PB N="167" REF="027591_0167_0FD7BF6A2E88F6C0">
and not from the depraved will of man, which fluctuating, accord+ing to the different intere&s;ts, humours, and pa&s;&s;ions, that at &s;everal times reign in &s;everal nations, one day abrogates what had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> acted the other. This &s;entiment, then, ju&s;t and rea&s;onable in it&s;elf can never be con&s;trued into a reflection upon the pre&s;ent govern+ment; unle&s;s you &s;uppo&s;e that which I never a&s;&s;erted, namely that it <HI>is applicable</HI> to the pre&s;ent government; in which ca&s;e you mu&s;t commit the very offence which you are called upon to con|demn, and attribute tho&s;e motives to the particular magi&s;trates of our own country, which I only &s;uppo&s;ed might occa&s;ionally influ|ence the conduct of many.</P>
<P>I am next charged with &s;aying <Q>were all mankind to a&s;&s;emble in public meetings, one of two things mu&s;t follow; either they will behave properly or improperly; if properly, their meeting will tend to good; if improperly, it carries its own cure along with it. The people will be &s;oon brought into a better method by a &s;en&s;e of &s;elf pre&s;ervation, by which they will correct the er|rors into which they have fallen.</Q> Than this &s;entiment, gentle|men, I conceive nothing can be more innocent, and more &s;trictly and logically true. By the "a&s;&s;embly of the whole community" I cer|tainly did not mean what a learned lord, in his argument on the re|levancy, erroneou&s;ly. I hope not intentionally, &s;tated to be my mean|ing, the meeting of all the people in their collective capacity, which would impede bu&s;ine&s;s, and give ri&s;e to tumults. No.&mdash;I meant the meeting of the people in their repre&s;entative capacity&mdash; but, &s;uch a repre&s;entation as &s;hould collect and expre&s;s their wills, as really and truly as if they had been a&s;&s;embled in their <HI>collective</HI> capacity. A fair, full, and complete repre&s;entation&mdash;not a delu&s;ive vi&s;ion, an emp|ty phantom, an unreal mockery. This I can al&s;o inform his lord&s;hip was the only &s;en&s;e conveyed by my words, <HI>'the great art of govern|ment is that all &s;hould be governed by all',</HI>&mdash;words, (which his lord|&s;hip thought proper to ridicule becau&s;e he did not under&s;tand them,) and which, be&s;ides their own intrin&s;ic weight have been adopted by wi&s;e and virtuous men, both in ancient and in modern times. "This therefore, (&s;ays, Sir William Temple, when &s;peaking of the con&s;ti|tution of the ancient Germans, from which our own is, as we have &s;een, derived) is that con&s;titution, which has been celebrated as the true&s;t and the ju&s;te&s;t temper that has ever been found out between dominion and liberty; and it &s;eems to be a &s;train of what Heraclitus &s;aid was the only &s;kill, or knowledge of any value in politics, which was <HI>the &s;ecret of governing all by all" (Sir William Temple, Mi&s;cellanies part</HI> ii. <HI>p.</HI> 255.) Surely, if ever there was a principle of plain &s;en&s;e, this is one; for who &s;o likely to promote their own inter|e&s;ts as the per&s;ons mo&s;t concerned in it? Who &s;o eager to ap|ply the cure, as tho&s;e who feel mo&s;t acutely the &s;mart of the di&s;or|der?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am further charged with having &s;aid, that "if go|vernments were to in&s;truct the poor in&s;tead of hanging up their
<PB N="168" REF="027591_0168_0FD54CDA64476A20">
bodies on gibbets, the voice of the people would then be the voice of God." Now, what do the&s;e words amount to? Why, that &s;ince every government claims a <HI>right</HI> to puni&s;h, it is previou&s;ly boned to in&s;truct the &s;ubject in what he &s;hould do to avoid it. For, as the ju&s;t powers of government, as we have before had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, are derived from the people; &s;o no people either will delegate, or can have a right to delegate, to any &s;et of men, the power of wantonly inflicting pain upon them; which, undoubtedly, would be the ca&s;e, if the &s;ubject could, without inju&s;tice, &s;uffer the penalty of a law, even though he had not been previou&s;ly told of its exi&s;tence. I &s;peak not, now, of tho&s;e moral laws which pure native intellect enables us to di&s;cover, and which may be read, as Dryden &s;ays, without the <HI>&s;pectacles of books,</HI> but merely of tho&s;e po&s;itive regulations of &s;ociety which mere human intellect alone cannot know to be breaches of duty, unle&s;s previou&s;ly in&s;tructed. In the&s;e ca&s;es, then, to withhold in&s;truction is, on the part of go|vernment, not merely the omi&s;&s;ion of duty, but the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime; and &s;ociety &s;ins again&s;t the man before the man can &s;in a|gain&s;t &s;ociety. I therefore infer, that in&s;truction alone can con&s;ti|tute a duty, and that laws can enforce no obedience but where they are explained. This, my lords, is not factious doctrine, nor cal|culated to weaken the principle of obedience to the laws: they are preci&s;ely the &s;entiments of Sir William Black&s;tone, a judge who&s;e principles were mo&s;t unque&s;tionably loyal, and who makes exactly the &s;ame di&s;tinction, as I have done, between the <HI>mala pro|hibita,</HI> and the <HI>mala in &s;e;</HI> Black&s;tone's Commentaries, Vol. iv. p. 8. between offences again&s;t the law of nature, and offences again&s;t the &s;tate. The lawfulne&s;s of puni&s;hing criminals, &s;ays he, is found|ed upon this principle, that <HI>"the law, by which they &s;uffer, was made by their own con&s;ent;</HI> it is a part of the original contract into which they have entered, when fir&s;t they engaged in &s;ociety; it was calculated for, and has long contributed to their own &s;ecurity." Now, if the con&s;ent of the puni&s;hed be the only lawful principle of authority on the part of the puni&s;her, that con&s;ent mu&s;t be ei|ther expre&s;s or implied. That it is an <HI>expre&s;s</HI> con&s;ent, it can never be contended, and as to an <HI>implied</HI> con&s;ent, we are &s;till authori&s;ed to a&s;k, what is the ground of the implication?</P>
<P>The publication of an act of parliament (the only mode of publica|tion which government conde&s;cends to make u&s;e of) by the king's printer, only&mdash;in the old German character, which few men can read&mdash;and which is &s;old at a price which as few can afford to pay, rather re&s;embles the behaviour of Caligula, the Roman tyrant, who (according to Dion Ca&s;ius) wrote his laws in a very &s;mall character, and hung them up on high pillows, the more effectually to en&s;nare the people, than the conduct of a legi&s;lature, who&s;e authority, be|ing founded on the <HI>con&s;ent of the people,</HI> mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, <HI>break their tru&s;t,</HI> whenever they violate the principle which created them.&mdash; To read to the pri&s;oner, for <HI>the fir&s;t time,</HI> when he &s;tands at the
<PB N="169" REF="027591_0169_0FD7BF43ED77A9E8">
tribunal, any act, for the breach of which he is arraigned, is to him preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing as it would be to originate it at the time by the &s;ame tribunal, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of condemna|tion. In &s;uch ca&s;e, indeed, he may peri&s;h by the forms, but cer|tainly not by the principles of ju&s;tice. Sir William Black&s;tone al&s;o regrets the frequency of capital puni&s;hments to be found in our code; and feelingly &s;ays, <Q>that it is a melancholy truth that among the variety of actions which men are daily liable to com|mit, no le&s;s than <HI>one hundred and &s;ixty have been declared by act of parliament to be worthy of in&s;tant death;'</HI> and adds, 'that &s;o dreadful a li&s;t in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, increa&s;es the number of offenders.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, it was upon a painful review of this &s;ubject, that I a&s;&s;erted that <Q>government&punc; had far better in&s;truct the people than hang up their bodies on gibbets;</Q> for as there is &s;omething in the nature of man, that &s;o &s;evere puni&s;hments have never been found effectual to prevent any &s;ort of crime. The mo&s;t effectual way to prevent crimes is, to prevent the temptation; to take care that the people be educated in virtuous principles, and every man brought up and enured to labour and indu&s;try, that has no e&s;tate to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on. If this be not done laws may be avenged but can|not be obeyed; they may in&s;pire terror, but can never command re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, and I think it lies within the com|pa&s;s of my defence to &s;tate to you, that we can only be innocent in coming down for the purpo&s;e of procuring reform, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition that reform was nece&s;&s;ary, and if I had not been al|lowed to go into the proof of that fact, I &s;hould &s;tand in this me|lancholy &s;ituation&mdash;that a charge would be brought again&s;t me, and the only proper means of repelling that charge would be de|nied me.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I now come to the di&s;&s;ection of the evidence, which I tru&s;t, you will find to be &s;o &s;canty, and in&s;ufficient, as that it is impo&s;&s;ible to fix upon me any well-grounded and colourable charge of &s;edition.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the phantom conjured up to terrify the timid, the Medu&s;a's head which is to petrify you all with horror and a&s;to|ni&s;hment, is the motion attributed to Mr. Sinclair, (but which I &s;hall, &s;hortly, prove to you never pa&s;&s;ed) which not only inculcated the principle of re&s;i&s;tance, but with the Briti&s;h Convention it is a&s;|&s;erted meant to carry into execution.</P>
<P>I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to day, to hear this legal and con|&s;titutional principle denied in round and unqualified terms; when it &s;hould be recollected, that it is to this principle we owe our liberties. The right of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, is a right of which no human in&s;titution can dive&s;t us, &s;ince human in&s;titutions them|&s;elves, were formed only the more completely to accompli&s;h that
<PB N="170" REF="027591_0170_0FD7BF50ADE874E8">
end. To &s;upport any political in&s;titution, therefore by the de|&s;truction of that principle would be ab&s;urdly to &s;acrifice the end to the means. <Q>If the laws of God and men (&s;ays Sydney) when the magi&s;tracy is left at liberty to break them, and if the lu&s;ts of tho&s;e, who are too &s;trong for the tribunals of ju&s;tice cannot be otherwi&s;e re&s;trained than by &s;edition, tumults, and wars,&mdash; tho&s;e &s;editions, tumults and wars, are ju&s;tified by the laws of God and man.</Q> Sydney on government, p. 188. For as all magi&s;trates were &s;et up for the good of the people; &s;o whenever they act contrary to the end of their in&s;titution, they may be law|fully oppo&s;ed; <HI>Quia eatenus</HI> (as Grotius well ob&s;erves) <HI>non habent imperium.</HI> De Jure Belli, l. 1. c. 4. Here then, gentlemen, you &s;ee the principles of re&s;i&s;tance laid down by a writer on the civil law (with who&s;e works, their lord&s;hips are, po&s;&s;ibly far better ac|quainted than I,) and recognized al&s;o by that &s;age and hero the immortal Sydney, who, after a life &s;pent in a continual &s;truggle again&s;t vice, tyranny and faction, fell a martyr at la&s;t to the liber|ties of his country. The &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon him, however, by the infamous Jeffries, has met with the unanimous execration of po&s;terity, and his attainder was accordingly repealed among the fir&s;t acts which took place at the Revolution.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, were I called upon to give a definition of &s;edition or of rebellion, I would frankly avow, that I know of no other than this; the <HI>con&s;piracy of the law again&s;t the intere&s;ts of the many.</HI> And this rebellion may be equally carried on by tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the power of the &s;tate, as by tho&s;e who originally conferred it, and who are the objects of its exerci&s;e. <Q>If tho&s;e who by force take away the legi&s;lature,' &s;ays Locke, 'are <HI>rebels,</HI> the <HI>legi&s;lators them&s;elves,</HI> as has been &s;hewn, can be no le&s;s e&s;teem|ed &s;o, when they who were &s;et up for the protection and pre|&s;ervation of the people, their liberties and properties, &s;hall invade and endeavour to take them away: And &s;o they, putting them|&s;elves in a &s;tate of war with tho&s;e, who made them the protectors and guardians of their peace, ARE PROPERLY, AND WITH THE GREATEST AGGRAVATION REBELS.</Q> Treati&s;e on Government, octavo edition, p. 294, 5.</P>
<P>This principle of re&s;i&s;tance, gentlemen, is deeply interwoven in our con&s;titution, and is as &s;trongly laid down, even by writers on our municipal law, as it is by tho&s;e, who are philo&s;ophical and &s;pe|culative. <Q>The liberties of Engli&s;hmen (&s;ays Black&s;tone, Vol. I. p. 144.) &s;hould be perfectly known and con&s;idered by every man of rank and property le&s;t his ignorance of the points whereon they are founded &s;hould hurry him into faction and licentiou&s;ne&s;s on the one hand, or a pu&s;illanimous indifference and <HI>criminal &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion on the other.</HI></Q> Nor do I apprehend that this knowledge of the rights of Britons, is to be limited merely to men of rank and proper|ty &s;ince <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he poor man is, and by the &s;ame means too, equally entitled to the pre&s;ervation of his <HI>mite,</HI> as the rich man to the enjoyment

of his millions. And of this opinion al&s;o &s;eems to be the learned judge, when, &s;hortly after, he &s;ays <Q>to vindicate the&s;e rights, when actually violated or attacked, the <HI>&s;ubjects of England</HI> are enti|tled, in the fir&s;t place,</Q> (the word &s;ubjects is certainly equally appli|cable to all de&s;criptions, high and low, rich and poor) <Q>to the regular admini&s;tration and free cour&s;e of ju&s;tice in the courts of law; next, to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for re|dre&s;s of grievances; and la&s;tly, to THE RIGHT OF HAVING AND USING ARMS FOR SELF-PRESERVATION AND DEFENCE.</Q> Vol. 1. p. 144. Thus you &s;ee, gentlemen, that the&s;e principles are neither new nor dangerous; not new&punc; becau&s;e co-eval with the Re|volution; not dangerous, becau&s;e avowed by a calm philo&s;ophical writer who enjoyed the favour and patronage of his &s;overeign, and &s;ince &s;upported by the authority of an eminent writer who&s;e office it was to lay down the principles of law, and admini&s;ter ju&s;tice to the &s;ubjects of the&s;e realms.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I defy our bittere&s;t enemies to prove that it was e|ver our intention to make any practical application of the&s;e doctrines; for, as the &s;ame learned judge well ob&s;erves, "all oppre&s;&s;ions, as they may happen to &s;pring from any branch of the &s;overeign power, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be out of the reach of any <HI>&s;tated rule,</HI> or <HI>expre&s;s legal</HI> provi&s;ion;" &s;o I &s;ay with him al&s;o that "if e|ver they unfortunately happen, the <HI>prudence of the times mu&s;t provide new remedies upon new emergencies."</HI> Black&s;tone, Vol. 1. p. 245.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;hall now &s;tate to you, as &s;hortly as I can, what was &s;aid by the witne&s;&s;es. Mr. Scott &s;ays, I think, among o|ther things, that when he came into the convention, on the 6th of December, he a&s;ked the chairman the object of our meeting. The reply was, that we were met for the purpo&s;e of addre&s;&s;ing the king.</P>
<P>Mr. David&s;on tells you, indeed, that he came for the purpo&s;e of di&s;per&s;ing the meeting. He was a&s;ked, al&s;o, if there was any ap|pearance oi tumult. He an&s;wers in the negative; that there was no appearance of tumult and di&s;order, though the pre&s;ident was for|cibly taken out of the chair; to whom he, at fir&s;t gave a friendly &s;hake, though he was afterwards obliged to convert it into a Cor|ni&s;h hug. WE, then, gentlemen, were the per&s;ons who were for|cibly a&s;&s;aulted; but we did not make u&s;e of force for the purpo&s;e of repelling force.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the external proofs that have been alledged, particu|larly of this re&s;olution which was &s;aid to have pa&s;&s;ed, amount to what? They amount, in fact, merely, to this, that a number of pa|pers were taken from a public Inn by the officer, and put into a loo&s;e bundle; then taken by him to the &s;heriff's office, where they were left for &s;ome time, without any particular attention being paid to them; certainly in &s;o loo&s;e a &s;tate that it was very po&s;&s;ible for any other papers to have been put in; con&s;equently all degree
<PB N="172" REF="027591_0172_0FD54CE2AE39A610">
of credibility due to the evidence is done away, ina&s;much as they were not &s;ealed, though I under&s;tand it is always the cu&s;tom to &s;eal up papers, as it appeared from the evidence delivered to-day at the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. For, I conceive that, after they have been in that loo&s;e &s;tate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t is impo&s;&s;ible ever to identify the&s;e papers, unle&s;s the man has the faculty of looking through a pocket handkerchief. How is it po&s;&s;ible, if the papers had been taken and put into a loo&s;e bun|dle, and &s;uffered to lie a con&s;iderable time without any actual in|&s;pection, and &s;everal per&s;ons being in the room; how is it po&s;&s;ible, I &s;ay, that the&s;e papers can be proved to be the &s;ame that were taken out of the room of Mr. Sinclair?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you will find one material circum&s;tance, however, to which, I tru&s;t, you will give your mo&s;t mature con&s;ideration, to which is, that an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> attempt to identify tho&s;e papers &s;hould, by all regular and due cour&s;e of evidence, have been made, before they are produced to the jury, as the ground of criminating any pannel at this bar; for, if they are not indentified, I do not &s;ee with what colour or ju&s;tice they can be brought forward for the purpo&s;e of criminating any per&s;on. This paper is not proved ever to have been adopted as a re&s;olution by the convention. It no where ap|pears, even in what is called the minutes of the convention, but which I deny to be the minutes of the convention; nor is there a|ny proof that ever they were adopted by the convention <HI>as</HI> their minutes. It ought to have been proved in the hand writing of Mr. Sinclair who is the reputed author of this motion; and even if an attempt to identify his hand-writing had been made, even then I &s;ay the evidence would &s;till have re&s;ted upon a very pre|carious foundation. In the ca&s;e of Algernon Sydney, it was a &s;i|milarity of hand-writing that was the principal ground of his con|viction. That very circum&s;tance, al&s;o, gentlemen, is recited in the act of parliament as one of the principal grounds of rever&s;ing his attainder; though the paper alluded to, was found in the clo|&s;et of Colonel Sydney, as this paper is &s;aid to have been found in the room of Mr. Sinclair. Sydney him&s;elf well ob&s;erves, upon his trial, "that &s;imilitude of hands is nothing; as hands may be &s;o counterfeited, that no man &s;hall know even his own hand. A gen|tleman that is now dead," &s;ays he, "told me that my Lord Ar|lington, about five years ago, de&s;ired him to write a letter and &s;eal it as well as he could. He wrote it with care, and &s;ealed it with a wafer and wax upon it; and within a few days my Lord Arling|ton brought him five letters, and he did not know which was his own." Trial of A. Syd. p. 31. If, then, gentlemen, even if there had been actual proof that this was in the hand-writing of Mr. Sinclair (a circum&s;tance which never could be proved, and which has not this day been attempted to be proved), if &s;uch actual proof, I &s;ay, would not have been admitted as &s;ufficient evidence to cri|minate Mr. Sinclair, ina&s;much as the motion in que&s;tion never be|came part of the minutes of the convention&mdash;far le&s;s &s;hould this &s;croll of paper condemn me, who am only accu&s;ed of verbally &s;up|porting
<PB N="173" REF="027591_0173_0FD7BF46EDAC6200">
the <HI>written</HI> motion which Mr. Sinclair is &s;aid to have made. If upon the trial of this excellent young man, who, at a period of life, which the greater part of mankind con&s;ume in frivolous or vi|cious di&s;&s;ipation, is dedicating his whole time to promote the hap|pine&s;s of his fellow-creatures; if upon a &s;ub&s;equent trial an hone&s;t and impartial jury &s;hall, as they mu&s;t, acquit him of the charge, both upon a general conviction of his innocence, and particularly, upon the in&s;ufficiency of the evidence brought again&s;t him, what mu&s;t be the remor&s;e, what the angui&s;h of that jury, who &s;hall have condemned the acce&s;&s;ary upon that very evidence, which, on the fulle&s;t inve&s;tigation, &s;hall have been found incompetent to the con|viction of the principal? This event, were it po&s;&s;ible to happen, I &s;hould mo&s;t deeply deplore, not merely on account of my own per|&s;onal &s;ufferings, but for the &s;candal it would affix to the admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice, for the di&s;grace it would bring upon our com|mon country; and, above all, for the deep and la&s;ting infamy that it would entail upon you, my countrymen, gentlemen of the jury. In &s;uch ca&s;e, the principle of my condemnation would even be wor&s;e than that of Sydney; po&s;terity would review it with equal abhorrence, and therefore let me conjure you, as you tender not only <HI>my &s;afety,</HI> but your own <HI>per&s;onal reputation,</HI> &s;uffer not the iniquities of <HI>tho&s;e</HI> times to be revived and imputed to the&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Mack tells you, that he did not get the papers from Lyon, that they were lying in the room in the &s;heriff-clerk's office care|le&s;sly. Mr. Skirving's papers were &s;ealed it &s;eems; but this mo|tion upon which the great ground of criminality is laid, is &s;uf|fered to lye loo&s;e. If that precaution was not taken equally in all ca&s;es, I certainly ought not to &s;uffer for the negligence of the of|ficer.</P>
<P>There is one certain and infallible proof, gentlemen, that this mo|tion, upon which &s;o much &s;tre&s;s is laid, never did, in reali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, pa&s;s in the convention. It has come out in the evidence, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e motion was marked by Mr. Aitche&s;on&mdash;if then, it was marked by him, it clearly could not have been adopted by the convention; for if it had, it would have gone into the hands of the Secretary, who would have marked it with his own &s;ignature, and it would have con&s;tituted part of the minutes. On the contrary, you have &s;trong circum&s;tan|tial proof (the be&s;t that the nature of the ca&s;e will admit) that &s;o far from pa&s;&s;ing in the convention it was even laid a&s;ide; ina&s;much as it was only marked by Aitche&s;on, and not by the &s;ecretary who&s;e practice it was invariably to mark them as an e&s;&s;ential preparative to their in&s;ertion in the minutes. Be&s;ides gentlemen, where was this paper found? Was it found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Skirving, when <HI>all</HI> his papers were &s;eized, and to who&s;e cu&s;tody all re&s;olutions that pa&s;&s;ed in the convention was regularly committed? No; it was not even pretended to have been &s;o found; it is &s;tated to have been found in the cu&s;tody of Mr. Sinclair alone who was a &s;imple member of the convention, and who was never entru&s;ted with the guardian|&s;hip
<PB N="174" REF="027591_0174_0FD7BF6DC3F4CD58">
of its minutes. This &s;ingle fact renders all rea&s;oning upon the &s;ubject unnece&s;&s;ary. It amounts to a moral demon&s;tration of what I advance; and he who would not be convinced by proof &s;o glaring, and facts &s;o undeniable, would not receive <HI>conviction though one &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead.</HI></P>
<P>Gentlemen, you no doubt, are well aware, that it is the duty of jurymen to find the verdict <HI>&s;ecundum alegata et probata, according to facts alledged and proved.</HI> Many principles contained in tho&s;e &s;peeches attributed to me I glory in having uttered, as they are per|fectly reconcileable with the &s;ounde&s;t principles of government and good order. But there are parts of tho&s;e &s;peeches which are fal&s;e and &s;purious. Animated as I am, with a love of truth, and determin|ed to tell it at whatever hazard, I will neither a&s;&s;ume what I <HI>have not</HI> &s;aid, nor deny what I <HI>have &s;aid.</HI> If then, you give me credit, which, I am &s;ure, as hone&s;t men you cannot withhold from me, for my veracity and openne&s;s in one in&s;tance, you have no right to mi&s;|tru&s;t me in another.</P>
<P>I have already told you, that as jurymen you are bound to find a verdict according to facts alledged and proved. I, now, gentlemen, will &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;k what evidence have you, that the &s;peeches charged in the indictment, and which are copied from the Gazetteer, are the real &s;peeches which I made in the convention? What is the mode of proof? Thomas Cockburn tells you that he had a <HI>general</HI> collec|tion, when he was in the habit of reading the Gazetteer, that they bore a re&s;emblance to the &s;peeches which he has heard me make in the convention. Gentlemen, I tru&s;t you are well aware of the &s;a|cred duty which you are now to execute, and that you will be of o|pinion, that in a ca&s;e &s;o &s;olemn as the pre&s;ent, a bare general collec|tion of what is &s;aid, or &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;aid, in the heat of debate, will never con&s;titute a &s;ufficient ground of criminal conviction. I allow, that in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ordinary intercour&s;es of life, a general collection is cer|tainly &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">nt ground whereon to form a judgment, otherwi&s;e hu|man affairs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;t &s;tand &s;till. But you are not now met for the ordi|nary purpo&s;es of life; you are met to determine the guilt or inno|cence of a man, accu&s;ed, on the one hand, of having di&s;turbed the peace, and e&s;teemed on the other, for having attempted to promote the good of his country; and upon your determination will re&s;t, not only his fortune and his fame, but, in all probability, his life it&s;elf. What then is the evidence upon which this great &s;take depends? Mr. Cockburn, when pre&s;&s;ed by my coun&s;el, who, through the whole cour&s;e of the cau&s;e have conducted them&s;elves, not only like able coun&s;el, but like firm and inflexible patriots, &s;ays, that he cannot identify one &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age. What does this confe&s;&s;ion amount to? That he cannot &s;wear they are the &s;peeches I made; for, if the terms general recollection have any meaning at all, I apprehend they have this meaning, that all general recollections are compo&s;ed of the recol|lection, of &s;ome <HI>particular</HI> pa&s;&s;ages. Now, he does not identify one &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age. Some of them you may deem criminal, and others innocent; nay, even meritorious; and therefor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="175" REF="027591_0175_0FD7BF6EFA10EDE0">
I pre&s;ume you cannot convict any pannel upon &s;uch loo&s;e indeter|minate evidence; which is, at lea&s;t, as likely to fix upon him what is prai&s;e-worthy, as it is to charge him with what is criminal. But he recollects, 'a great many words inter&s;per&s;ed in that &s;peech.' Why, doubtle&s;s, gentlemen, when Mr. Cockburn had heard any per&s;on &s;peak for a con&s;iderable length of time, he mu&s;t have &s;ome re|collection upon his mind of what had pa&s;&s;ed; but I tru&s;t that words inter&s;per&s;ed through a &s;peech are certainly too loo&s;e to found a ver|dict of conviction of a far le&s;s crime than that of which I am accu|&s;ed, and to authori&s;e a puni&s;hment of far le&s;s &s;everity than &s;uch as if convicted I &s;hall inevitably &s;uffer.</P>
<P>This gentlemen is, &s;o far as concerns the fir&s;t &s;peeches. But of the &s;econd &s;peech he &s;ays he recollects le&s;s than of any other; though this is the &s;peech upon which Mr. Solicitor General chiefly founds his charge, and again&s;t which he has planted the whole ar|tillery of the law. After all, gentlemen, the witne&s;s, though clo&s;e|ly pre&s;&s;ed in his examination by the crown lawyers, clo&s;es his evi|dence with the&s;e remarkable words <HI>'that he does not mean to identify any of the &s;peeches.</HI></P>
<P>Gentlemen, if the freedom and lives of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects are depen|dant upon the loo&s;e and general recollection of words &s;poken too at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance of time, we may, indeed <HI>boa&s;t</HI> our liberties and the benignity of our laws, but they are merely an <HI>empty boa&s;t,</HI> and not a &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial good.</P>
<P>But, gentlemen, there is one circum&s;tance &s;till &s;tronger than any I have &s;tated to you. If any per&s;om might be &s;uppo&s;ed to retain an accurate recollection of the &s;peeches, it mu&s;t be William Ro&s;s, who being able to write &s;hort-hand, would in all probability carry away with him, with more accuracy than any other per&s;on, the &s;peeches which are attributed to me. Ro&s;s tells you, he never took notes by the expre&s;s direction of the convention, nor ever publi&s;hed them by their order. Now, if charges of criminality are to be brought forward again&s;t men upon &s;uch loo&s;e evidence as this&mdash;the unautho|ri&s;ed tran&s;cript of a &s;hort-hand writer, and which tran&s;cript, or e|ven verbal evidence, is to be taken as proof&mdash;we mu&s;t deem the ju|dicial proce&s;s of our country not a &s;hield of protection, but a rod of cha&s;ti&s;ement. Per&s;ons actuated by malicious motives, the retain|ers of a profligate admini&s;tration, may enter the meetings by a &s;hort-hand writer, and, for a &s;mall gratification, may induce him to take down, as the &s;peeches of any member, words highly criminal, but which at the &s;ame time have never been &s;poken; and afterwards, by procuring them to be in&s;erted in a new&s;paper, may &s;ubject the party to a &s;tate pro&s;ecution. Again&s;t this engine of per&s;ecution what remedy has innocence? Why, the party aggrieved, may pro&s;ecute the printer for a libel, I mean if he has money, for that is a nece&s;&s;ary ingredient to the attainment of ju&s;tice: and if he has none, however deep the injury, and calamitous its con&s;equence, he mu&s;t &s;it down &s;ilent under the charge, until he has an opportunity of
<PB N="176" REF="027591_0176_0FD54CE9E2C0F900">
vindicating his innocence in court when the Lord Advocate, who is, <HI>ex officio,</HI> the guardian of our liberties, &s;hall be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to drag him, as the ill-fated victim of a &s;tate pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the rules of evidence, being all founded upon the plain principles of common &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t in all countries be nearly the &s;ame. In an Engli&s;h Court of Judicature the evidence produced again&s;t me would, I am certain, be deemed incompetent to a conviction on the &s;lighte&s;t charge. Why then in Scotland &s;hould not an equal mea&s;ure of ju&s;tice be meted out to me, an Engli&s;hman, which you, though Scot&s;men, would in England readily obtain?</P>
<P>Furthermore, Ro&s;s the &s;hort-hand writer &s;wears that he is not ve|ry well &s;killed in his art&mdash;which, even in the mo&s;t &s;kilful, is a falla|cious mode of identifying a &s;peech&mdash;nay, that he was afflicted with deafne&s;s when he attended the convention, and, having frequently lo&s;t the thread of my di&s;cour&s;e, in&s;erted of his <HI>own invention,</HI> a great part of that which appeared in his paper. Gentlemen, is not this &s;ingle confe&s;&s;ion &s;ufficient totally to de&s;troy the identity of the &s;peech|es, and con&s;equently the &s;olidity of the evidence again&s;t me? A que|&s;tion was a&s;ked by one of the jurymen which carried with it an ap|parent weight&mdash;whether any of the convention had complained that their &s;peeches were in&s;erted or mi&s;repre&s;ented? To which Ro&s;s an|&s;wered, No. I am &s;ure you cannot but be aware, that if the mem|bers of the convention had been in the con&s;tant habit of complaining of all the mi&s;repre&s;entations which the lying breath of rumour had circulated again&s;t them&mdash;if they had thought it nece&s;&s;ary formally to contradict whatever malice propagated and credulity received&mdash;the object of their mi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t have been entirely abandoned; and in&s;tead of a&s;&s;erting tho&s;e principles which we felt to be ju&s;t, our time would have been con&s;umed in refuting a&s;per&s;ions which we knew to be fal&s;e. No! gentlemen, we re&s;ted upon the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our innocence, and upon the broad ba&s;is of public confidence, to which our hone&s;t and di&s;intere&s;ted exertions had given us a claim.</P>
<P>George Ro&s;s depones, that I had no knowledge of the in&s;ertion of the words, <HI>Ca ira, Vive la Convention, Liberty Hall, &amp;c.</HI> but that he him&s;elf was the per&s;on who in&s;erted the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. I &s;hould not have re|peated this in&s;ignificant circum&s;tance, but that I ob&s;erve unfair infer|ences have been drawn from them, in order to load us with addition|al guilt.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I hold this to be a &s;ound principle both of rea&s;on and of law, that if you once can prove that any meeting was in it&s;elf legal, though after the meeting any illegal re&s;olutions were adopted, provided it cannot be proved that you were pre&s;ent at tho&s;e meet|ings aiding and abetting tho&s;e illegal re&s;olutions &s;o pa&s;&s;ed, no degree of criminality can po&s;&s;ibly attach to you.</P>
<P>You are then to advert to the general principle which proves the illegality of the meeting, and not to the particular re&s;olution which if you did not &s;upport can never be brought in evidence again&s;t you. Much &s;tre&s;s has been laid upon this committee of &s;ecrecy, upon which
<PB N="177" REF="027591_0177_0FD54CEAEE1F76F0">
very &s;trange and contradictory language has been held by the public pro&s;ecutor. Sometimes we are repre&s;ented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s a &s;et of de&s;peradoes, who met in open day for the purpo&s;e of violating the laws and the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting con&s;titution of the country: at other times that we met in holes and corners, as our projects were &s;o nefarious that they could not bear the light. To round the circle of contradictions, a learned judge upon the bench has declared, <Q>that however criminal our in|tentions, our conduct was open, and in this re&s;pect our imprudence was equal to our guilt.</Q> By the&s;e various and even oppo&s;ite charges, the puni&s;hment inflicted by the Sicilian tyrant is realized up|on the unfortunate members of the convention&mdash;&s;tretched upon the iron bed of legal torture, if too long we are lopt, if too &s;hort we are &s;tretched. If we act with openne&s;s, there our candor is audacious guilt; if &s;ecretly, we only refrain from in&s;ulting our country by the publicity of our mea&s;ures, that we may in greater &s;ecurity accom|pli&s;h her ruin. Seven men, it &s;eems, were deemed &s;ufficient by this re&s;olution, to con&s;titute a convention, which was to overturn the government! Ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible &s;uppo&s;ition! Were our rebelli|ous troops, like tho&s;e of Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ayes, at Brentford, to &s;tart up when called for? Or, is it &s;uppo&s;ed that we were to realize the fable of Pyrrha and Deucalion, and generate men by ca&s;ting &s;tones behind us? The very &s;uppo&s;ition of your giving the &s;malle&s;t degree of cre|dit to this ab&s;urd allegation, would reflect &s;uch di&s;grace upon <HI>your</HI> un|der&s;tandings, and is &s;o highly derogatory to the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, the principles of which are the objects of univer&s;al reverence, that I can|not entertain it for a moment. For feeble, indeed, mu&s;t the founda|tion of that con&s;titution be, which can be even endangered, much more overturned, by a meeting of no more than &s;even individuals.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, from a particular expre&s;&s;ion &s;tated in this indictment, <HI>calamitous circum&s;tances,</HI> you mu&s;t &s;ee that we looked upon every inva&s;ion to be calamitous, from whatever quarter it proceeded;&mdash; but, if we had intended to make an open oppo&s;ition to the laws of our country, or were plotting its de&s;truction &s;ecretly and in the dark, we &s;hould, certainly, never, have u&s;ed an epithet of that de&s;cription. The very in&s;ertion of the term calamitous proves to a moral demon&s;tration that all inva&s;ions, from whatever quar|ter, would have been deemed objects not of approbation, but of re|gret.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it has been &s;aid, that the admi&s;&s;ion of foreign troops into Great Britain was al&s;o one of the calamitous circum&s;tances which would induce the convention to meet again. To this charge, if it will avail any thing to the public pro&s;ecutor, I freely plead guil|ty. As a Briton I &s;hall ever think my&s;elf bound to watch with anxious attention the introduction of any foreign troops, and upon this plain principle, that I conceive the native valour of Britons is always adequate to their own protection. If it be otherwi&s;e, we hold our freedom by the mo&s;t brittle tenure&mdash;for as foreigners can
<PB N="178" REF="027591_0178_0FD54CEC62B29568">
have no common intere&s;t with Britons, the &s;ame mercenary arm which protects us for pay may en&s;lave us for plunder. But what does this re&s;olution &s;tate? That we will do any thing <HI>uncon&s;titu|tional?</HI> Far from it. It &s;tates that "we &s;hall follow the whole|&s;ome example of our ance&s;tors, by paying no regard to any act which &s;hall militate <HI>again&s;t</HI> the con&s;titution of our country." Now, before government can properly make this re&s;olution a ground of criminal accu&s;ation again&s;t us, they mu&s;t confe&s;s that they either had pa&s;&s;ed, or meaned to pa&s;s an act, <HI>militating again&s;t the con&s;titu|tion.</HI> For under no other circum&s;tance was any oppo&s;ition men|tioned, or intended. Is it not rather &s;ingular then, that before they can infer <HI>our</HI> guilt, they mu&s;t confe&s;s <HI>their own?</HI> Acts of parlia|ment are in general &s;acred things, but they may be, in <HI>particular ca&s;es,</HI> &s;o grievous and oppre&s;&s;ive, that human nature will revolt from them. The con&s;titution, as Trea&s;urer Burleigh long &s;ince ob&s;erved, can never be undone but by a parliament; which proves however, that a parliament <HI>may</HI> undo it. In the reign of Henry VIII. an act of parliament was pa&s;&s;ed, giving to the proclamations of the crown the validity of a law. It was al&s;o made a capital offence for any per&s;on to foretel the death of the king&mdash;in con&s;equence of which, Sir Anthony Denny, his phy&s;ician, when he lay at the point of death, was af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid to mention to him the danger of his &s;i|tuation. To judge or <HI>believe</HI> that Anne Cleves was not a virgin when &s;he married him was declared high trea&s;on. Until very late|ly for a gip&s;ey to remain twelve months within the kingdom was declared felony without benefit of clergy. In Scotland, Evenus the third king of that name, cau&s;ed a law to pa&s;s, by which the wives and daughters of noblemen were expo&s;ed to his lu&s;t, and tho&s;e of the commons to the lu&s;t of his nobility. <HI>Tulit legem Eve|nus ut c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ivis liceret, pro opibus quot alere po&s;&s;et, uxores ducere; ut rex nuptias &s;pon&s;arum nobilium, nobilis plebeiarum proelibarent pudi|citiam, ut plebeiorum uxores cum nobilitates communes e&s;&s;ent.</HI> BUCH. L. 4. c. 14. Many other acts might be mentioned which have long blotted and di&s;graced the &s;tatute book; are the&s;e acts, then, in the eye of rea&s;on, proper objects of obedience? Nay, are they not rather honoured in the breach, than the ob&s;ervance? "Laws," &s;ays Hooker, "mu&s;t be obeyed, <HI>unle&s;s there be rea&s;on &s;howed that the law of rea&s;on, or of God, doth enjoin the contrary,"</HI> ECCLES. POL. B. 1. &s;ec. 16. Which plainly implies that there are bounds to the civil obedience of the &s;ubject. Acts, then, which are &s;ub|ver&s;ive of our happine&s;s, are contrary to every right of civil &s;ociety and comfort, utterly incompatible with all laws either moral or re|vealed, and therefore mere acts of power, having neither the force not validity of a law. But I deny that it was ever the intention of the Convention to re&s;i&s;t any acts by <HI>force.</HI> The words of the re&s;olution are, "unle&s;s compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force." What was this force to be &s;uperior to? Why, for&s;ooth, to twenty-one members peaceably met, and peaceably di&s;cu&s;&s;ing political &s;ub|jects.
<PB N="179" REF="027591_0179_0FD54CEDE1A12D38">
Nay, do not the very words them&s;elves plainly import, that though the mere <HI>mandate</HI> of the magi&s;trate (as &s;uch a mandate would be a gro&s;s violation of the law which he was bound to ob&s;erve) would be di&s;regarded by the Convention, yet the appearance of <HI>force</HI> would be the &s;ignal of di&s;per&s;ion? For upon what principle of common &s;en&s;e, or probabilities, can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that we &s;hould have wantonly expo&s;ed our lives to certain de&s;truction by an appeal to arms; we, few in number, peaceful in intention, with|out ability to act, without hope to &s;ucceed, without power, with|out influence, without motive, without means?</P>
<P>But the &s;incerity of this declaration has been already evinced by a fact of recent date and public notoriety. When Mr. Sheriff Da|vid&s;on, on the la&s;t evening on which the Convention &s;at, entered the hall, attended by con&s;tables and other officers, belonging to the <HI>civil</HI> power only, did the &s;lighte&s;t &s;ymptom appear of an inclination to re&s;i&s;t? No; Mr. Margarot and my&s;elf, who &s;ucce&s;&s;ively acted as pre&s;idents that evening, were indeed forcibly pulled out of the chair; becau&s;e, as we were con&s;cious, that we could not be <HI>legally</HI> ordered to quit it, a voluntary abdication would have been ju&s;tly interpreted as a dereliction of our right. But did we re&s;i&s;t, I again repeat? No; Mr. David&s;on's te&s;timony this day, has confirmed my a&s;&s;ertion. We di&s;per&s;ed, he tells you, without tumult or di&s;order. It was we, then, again&s;t whom force was employed, but who em|ployed none. We <HI>&s;uffered</HI> injury but <HI>offered</HI> none.</P>
<P>The introduction of foreign troops into the kingdom, <HI>without the &s;anction of parliament,</HI> is an infringement of the Bill of Rights, and a violation of the con&s;titution of our country. Doctrines, I know, have been openly avowed by the mini&s;ter, ju&s;tifying the mea&s;ure as legal and con&s;titutional; but this avowal, I believe, &s;truck every one who heard him, his own creatures excepted, with horror and a&s;toni&s;hment; nor do I apprehend, that at a future though not di&s;tant period, he will be fond of repeating what in the plenitude and in&s;olence of power he has lately advanced.</P>
<P>Lord Stanhope, who is a member of that legi&s;lature which ought to be the peculiar guardians of our rights and privileges, and who, I believe, is as incorrupt a &s;enator as ever this country gave birth to, &s;ince, like another Socrates at Athens, he pre&s;erves him&s;elf free from the contagion which is every where raging around him; Lord Stanhope, I &s;ay, with his accu&s;tomed hone&s;t daring thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf upon the &s;ubject of which I am now &s;peaking "Armies (&s;aid he) have in all ages been the engines of tyranny, and by them the civil rights and liberties of all nations have been de&s;troyed.

<P>Gentlemen, I cannot but ob&s;erve one very unfair &s;u&s;picion which the crown lawyers have endeavoured to infu&s;e into your minds du|ring the cour&s;e of the&s;e trials&punc; In order to inflame your pa&s;&s;ions, at the &s;ame time that they may a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves an <HI>appearance</HI> of lenity, they tell you that the crimes with which we &s;tand charged approach very nearly to high trea&s;on; and an appeal, not very ho|nourable I think to the appellants, is continually made to old and ob&s;olete &s;tatutes, on which &s;tate pro&s;ecutions were grounded when tyranny was at its height, to prove, that had we fallen, like the apo|&s;tles of freedom, in the la&s;t century, on tho&s;e 'evil days,' like them too we &s;hould have been the victims of a legal tyranny. This pro|cedure I mu&s;t con&s;ider as abhorrent, from the cool and &s;ober rules of ju&s;tice. Suffer not, therefore, I conjure you, your tempers to be inflamed, to the de&s;truction of an innocent man, becau&s;e the public pro&s;ecutor, in the rage and phrenzy of loyalty, has though proper to dig into the du&s;ty rubbi&s;h of antiquity, under which the embres of de&s;poti&s;m have long been &s;mothered, and to <Q>awaken tho&s;e &s;leeping lions by rattling up a company of old records which have lain for &s;o many ages by the wall neglected and forgotten<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lord Stafford's Speech in the State Trials.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, another circum&s;tance, upon which much &s;tre&s;s has been laid, is that of a blank appearing among the minutes; and as this blank followed after the re&s;olution which we have ju&s;t now been di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing, it has been unfairly inferred, that it was our intention to fill it up with matter, at a proper and convenient &s;ea&s;on, the publication of which would have amounted to high trea&s;on. But, gentlemen, if you will turn to the minutes, you will find that there is not one blank alone, but many. And this circum&s;tance, when coupled with the ob&s;ervation of the Solicitor General, mu&s;t convince you how ex|tremely dangerous it is to condemn any man upon the evidence of the&s;e minutes, which have been &s;o long in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who are the officers and dependents of government. For, as &s;tate pro&s;ecutions are frequently the in&s;truments, by which a profligate ad|mini&s;tration &s;acrifice the bold and incorruptible expo&s;ers of their mea|&s;ures, &s;o it is always in the power, as, no doubt, it mu&s;t be frequently in the inclination of the public pro&s;ecutor, to fill up the blanks with more heavy and additional matter, which being confounded with the original minutes, may be offered in evidence to a jury, as a &s;ufficient ground of conviction for high trea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="027591_0181_0FD7BF7030A71BD0">The difference of proce&s;s and of the criminal codes of Scotland and England mu&s;t, to every thinking mind, be a &s;ubject of mo&s;t &s;e|rious alarm.

<P>Gentlemen, during my trial a principle has been laid down by the Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk, which I deem to be in the highe&s;t degree, re|prehen&s;ible, as it &s;trikes at the root of that confidence which all men &s;hould repo&s;e in law, and of that &s;ecurity which all men have a right to expect from it. The Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk declared that the judges had a <HI>di&s;cretionary</HI> power in annexing the puni&s;hment to the particu|lar
<PB N="182" REF="027591_0182_0FD54CF4B7468728">
crime of &s;edition. Had a judge in England held a &s;imilar doc|trine, the judgment &s;eat would have tottered under him. If law be a certain rule of action, defining the offence and annexing the puni&s;h|ment, the degree and nature of the puni&s;hment &s;hould be &s;pecified, with equal preci&s;ion as the degree and nature of the offence; other|wi&s;e we hold our freedom as mere <HI>tenants at the will</HI> of a judge, and not as we ought, by the known and explicit declaration of the laws. Lord Camden, the fir&s;t law authority in England, has &s;aid, that, <Q>DISCRETION IS THE LAW of tyrants; in the be&s;t men it is caprice, in the wor&s;t it is every folly, vice, and infirmity to which human nature is liable.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, let not the word <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> mi&s;lead you. <HI>Legal di&s;cre|tion</HI> is not the <HI>arbitrary</HI> di&s;cretion of the judge. No; it is, as well defined by Lord Coke, <HI>di&s;cernere per legem quid &s;it ju&s;tum,</HI> "to di&s;cover through the medium of the law that which is ju&s;t and proper." <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">udges mu&s;t determine," (&s;ays the preamble to an old &s;tatute o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">enty VII.)

<P>Gentlemen, I tru&s;t that I have now proved to your conviction the general purity of my intention, of which the object was to car|ry into execution, a con&s;titutional reform in a peaceful manner; that however we may differ as men and citizens upon &s;peculative principles of government, yet the doctrines which I have advanc|ed are founded upon the great and immutable principles of rea&s;on and of truth; that they are the &s;entiments of the mo&s;t revered writers, Locke, Sydney, Jones&mdash;that even Mr. Pitt and the Duke of Richmond formerly <HI>profe&s;&s;ed</HI> to act upon them; that they are perfectly congenial to the &s;pirit of the Anglo-Saxon government, and not in a great degree differing from the principles of the old con&s;titution of Scotland, as Dr. Stewart has proved to you; that our peaceful re&s;olution of obtaining a reform was never violated by our practice, as the te&s;timony of Sheriff David&s;on evinces; for when a&s;&s;ailed by the civil power we repelled not force <HI>by</HI> force&mdash; that the officers of the law violated the law in their illegal a&s;&s;ault upon our per&s;ons; and that even <HI>then</HI> &s;uch was our de&s;ire to pre|&s;erve
<PB N="183" REF="027591_0183_0FD7BF71DAE8C758">
the public peace, that we cho&s;e rather to <HI>&s;uffer</HI> than to <HI>act;</HI>&mdash; though we could have acted under the &s;helter of tho&s;e laws which we are fal&s;ely charged with having a de&s;ign to &s;ubver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P>As men who&s;e rights and &s;ecurity are interwoven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th our own, advert, I be&s;eech you, to the circum&s;tances of our di&s;per&s;ion. The fir&s;t magi&s;trate in this city, attended by a po&s;&s;e of con&s;tables, enters the convention hall, when the members who compo&s;ed that con|vention were a&s;&s;embled upon a legal principle, for a con&s;titutional purpo&s;e, and conducting them&s;elves in a calm and peaceful man|ner. Without reading the riot act, for which indeed, he could have no pretext from the object and conduct of the meeting, he forcibly drags the pre&s;ident from the chair and di&s;per&s;es the convention. At a future day, when a meeting is adverti&s;ed to take place, not as the BRITISH CONVENTION, but of THE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE, the magi&s;trates of Edinburgh, attended by the town guard block up the pa&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e which we had hired as a place for our calm and peaceful di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and, though not the &s;lighte&s;t appearance of tumult exi&s;ted, <HI>forcibly</HI> prevent the members from a&s;&s;embling.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, if the principle upon which the&s;e magi&s;trates acted be a principle authori&s;ed by any human code, I &s;ay that its opera|tion and effect mu&s;t be the ba&s;ement of the human &s;pecies and the extinction of civilized &s;ociety. It dive&s;ts us of the right of exer|ci&s;ing our power of rea&s;on, and places us in a &s;ituation beneath, the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. If the magi&s;trate of any country makes <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed principles</HI> and not <HI>actions</HI> the object of coercion; if upon his own loo&s;e con&s;tructions and &s;peculations of danger he commits out|rage, under pretence of preventing it; if in&s;tead of arguing from the con&s;equence to the principle, he inverts every rule of right rea|&s;on, and infers the con&s;equence from what he thinks proper to <HI>ad|judge</HI> the principles the &s;afety and freedom of human action is at an end. In &s;uch ca&s;e the magi&s;trate takes upon him&s;elf to determine that which is undeterminable; to mark as an object of puni&s;hment not a pre&s;ent and actual, but a future, po&s;&s;ible, and contingent con|&s;equence; and, by puni&s;hing motives, which have not di&s;played their qualities by their effects, to arrogate to his own limited and &s;hort-&s;ighted capacity a privilege which belongs only to Eternal Om|ni&s;cience.</P>
<P>Feeble, indeed, mu&s;t be that civil government which depends for &s;upport, upon every trivial occa&s;ion, upon the aid of the military arm. But, in the ca&s;e alluded to, we had at lea&s;t one con&s;olation; the &s;ol|diery who interpo&s;ed were not a foreign but a Briti&s;h &s;oldiery; and I tru&s;t, that however the latter may be, for a time, deluded, they will recollect, upon all great and trying occa&s;ions, that though ne|ce&s;&s;ity may have made them &s;oldiers, yet &s;ociety has made them citizens, and nature has made them men. But not only are the principles, which I defended, pure; but even had they been other|wi&s;e, the evidence, I affirm, which has been produced in order to
<PB N="184" REF="027591_0184_0FD7BF732D527290">
fix them upon me, has been incompetent to its avowed purpo&s;e. Not the &s;lighte&s;t evidence has been afforded, that the convention either publi&s;hed, or cau&s;ed to be publi&s;hed by their authority, the&s;e &s;erolls of paper attributed to them as their minutes. They never authori&s;ed the publication of any &s;peeches which were made in the Convention; nor does it appear, by any te&s;timony, that the &s;peehes printed in the Gazetteer were identically the &s;peeches delivered in the convention. On the contrary Ro&s;s, the &s;hort-hand writer, &s;wears that he frequently in&s;erted, from his own mind, words and &s;entiments which never fell from the &s;peaker. There is no proof that the motion attributed to Mr. Sinclair, which is the great ground for criminating me, ever pa&s;&s;ed the Convention; and even if it had, an attempt to identify that motion with the paper pro|duced, &s;hould certainly have preceded it being produced in evi|dence. Why was this attempt not made? The rea&s;on is obvious, it mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, have failed. For was it not proved to you, that all Sinclair's papers which were &s;eized, were thrown into a loo&s;e bundle, un&s;ealed, to&s;&s;ed for a con&s;iderable time about the &s;heriff's office, in a &s;tate in which it was very ea&s;y for any per&s;on to have in&s;erted other papers not belonging to Mr. Sinclair, con&s;e|quently all po&s;&s;ibility of proving the identity of the papers ab&s;o|lutely de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;peeches attributed to me, not one witne&s;s would identify upon oath any one &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age which they contain. And even Cockburn, who&s;e te&s;timony upon that point is the &s;trong|e&s;t, declares, that he has only a general loo&s;e recollection of what pa&s;&s;ed; a ground certainly too &s;canty and in&s;ufficient for the convic|tion of a man whom the laws of his country <HI>pre&s;ume to be innocent;</HI> and which pre&s;umption can never be de&s;troyed but by the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of &s;tronger proof. <Q>Stabitur prae&s;umpioni donec probitur in contrarium: <HI>The pre&s;umption &s;tands till the contrary is proved.</HI></Q> <HI>Co. Litt.</HI></P>
<P>But the particular circum&s;tance to which I beg to chain down your attention, is the a&s;&s;ertion of the public pro&s;ecutor, that if you were convinced that my intentions were pure, you were bound in duty to pronounce my acquittal. Yes, gentlemen, this is the &s;olid rock of my defence; the purity of the intention by which I was actuated. Could any thing but an ardent love of truth, and a de&s;ire of pro|moting the happine&s;s of my fellow-creatures, have induced me to brave the pre&s;ent pro&s;ecution, and by di&s;pelling the mi&s;t of preju|dices which darkens their under&s;tandings, promote the happine&s;s even of my pro&s;ecutors them&s;elves? In this glorious, though ardu|ous undertaking, by what po&s;&s;ible motives of gain or ambition could I have been actuated? Examples have not been wanting of <HI>men of whom the world was not worthy,</HI> who have fallen victims to an active and zealous virtue; but their fate will never deter firm and well regulated minds from the performance of that which they will con&s;ider as the mo&s;t &s;acred of duties, the fulfilment of their
<PB N="185" REF="027591_0185_0FD7BF74AD67FE30">
engagements to their oppre&s;&s;ed and in&s;ulted country. The&s;e were the &s;entiments which actuated the conduct of our common ma&s;ter when he wept over the city. <Q>O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem! thou that &s;tone&s;t the prophets, and &s;laye&s;t them that are &s;ent unto thee; how often would I have gathered ye even as the hen ga|thereth the chickens under her wing, but ye would not!</Q></P>
<P>In every relative &s;ituation of life, we &s;hould do our duty, how|ever hazardous, and leave the con&s;equences, which mu&s;t be ulti|mately beneficial, to the &s;upreme di&s;po&s;er of all human events.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, when you con&s;ider that one great object of the Con|vention was to promote a more clo&s;e and &s;incere union between England and Scotland, you cannot rea&s;onably convict, as a di&s;turb|er of the public peace, any man engaged in &s;o laudable an underta|king. Yes, it is our pride and our boa&s;t that the extinction of tho&s;e national prejudices which have too long di&s;turbed and di&s;|graced both parts of the kingdom, was one great motive of our ho|ne&s;t exertions. And, &s;urely, our time is far better con&s;umed in &s;trengthening the cement of affection which, as inhabitants of the &s;ame i&s;land, it is &s;o natural for us to feel, than in wa&s;ting and ex|hau&s;ting our&s;elves in the wrangles and contentions of the continent, by which we abandon our local advantages as in Flanders, and ul|timately expo&s;e our&s;elves to become the prey of &s;ome foreign or dome&s;tic invader. To atchieve mighty conque&s;ts, is the lot of few; becau&s;e few there are, who have either ability or opportunity to obtain them. But to cheri&s;h and de&s;&s;eminate the principles of peace and good will towards all men, is certainly the duty of all, becau&s;e it lies within the power of all, and mu&s;t contribute to the happine&s;s of all. Mo|derate talents, &s;teady exertion, and good intentions are fully adequate to this end. This was all to which the members of the Convention made pretence; and they repo&s;e them&s;elves with confidence upon the judg|ment which their country may pa&s;s upon their conduct, whether the powers which they di&s;played, and the means which they adopted, were not well calculated for its attainment.</P>
<P>The Solicitor General, indeed, during the cour&s;e of this trial, has di&s;tingui&s;hed me by a marked and particular compliment; but it was coupled with a charge, that, if I am guilty, mu&s;t render me doubly &s;o; that my efforts were exerted to di&s;turb the peace of my country: No, gentlemen, whatever portion of talents God has thought pro|per to confer upon me has never yet been pro&s;tituted to &s;o imfamous a purpo&s;e, and I turn with horror from a compliment to my under|&s;tanding, which can only be purcha&s;ed by the extinction of every ge|nerous &s;entiment of the heart, and the &s;acrifice of all things that are &s;acred among men.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, when I look forward to the political horizon, the pro&s;pect &s;eems awful and gloomy to a degree, at which the be&s;t men mu&s;t &s;hudder, and the able&s;t men mu&s;t feel them&s;elves incompetent to de&s;cribe. Every thing is turbid and portentous. Indeed a black|er

cloud never hung over this i&s;land. Tho&s;e who are ver&s;ed in the hi&s;tory of their country, in the hi&s;tory of the human race, mu&s;t know that rigorous &s;tate pro&s;ecutions have always preceded the aera of con|vul&s;ion: and this aera, I fear, will be accelerated by the folly and madne&s;s of our rulers. If the people are di&s;contented, the proper mode of quieting their di&s;contents is, not by in&s;tituting rigorous and &s;anguinary pro&s;ecutions, but by redre&s;&s;ing their wrongs, and concilia|ting their affections. Courts of ju&s;tice, indeed, may be called in to the aid of mini&s;terial vengeance; but if once the purity of their pro|ceedings is &s;u&s;pected, they will cea&s;e to be objects of reverence to the nation; they will degenerate into empty and expen&s;ive pagean|try, and become the partial in&s;truments of vexatious oppre&s;&s;ion.&mdash; Whatever may become of me; my principles will la&s;t for ever. In|dividuals may peri&s;h; but truth is eternal. The rude bla&s;ts of ty|ranny may blow from every quarter; but freedom is that hardy plant which will &s;urvive the tempe&s;t, and &s;trike an everla&s;ting root into the mo&s;t unfavourable &s;oil.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with the ju&s;tice of the&s;e &s;entiments, dungeons, fetters, exile, carry no horror to me; for I &s;ay, with the immortal Sydney, <Q>though I have a particular love to my country, of which, I hope, that I have given &s;ome te&s;timony; though I think that being ex|iled from it is a great evil, from which I would redeem my&s;elf with the lo&s;s of a great deal of my blood; yet, when that country of mine, which u&s;ed to be e&s;teemed a paradi&s;e, is now like to be made a &s;tage of injury; the liberty which we hoped to e&s;tabli&s;h oppre&s;&s;ed; the be&s;t of our nation made a prey to the wor&s;t; the parliament, court, and army corrupted; the people en&s;laved; all things vendible, and no man &s;afe, but by &s;uch evil and infamous means as flattery and bribery; what joy can I have in my own country in this condition? Is it a plea&s;ure to &s;ee all that I love in the world &s;old and de&s;troyed? Shall I renounce all my old princi|ples, learn the vile court arts, and make my peace by bribing &s;ome of the crew? Shall their corruptions and vice be my &s;afety? Ah! no; better is a life among &s;trangers than in my own country upon &s;uch conditions. Whil&s;t I live I will endeavour to pre&s;erve my liberty; or, at lea&s;t, not con&s;ent to the de&s;troying of it. I hope I &s;hall die in the &s;ame principles in which I have lived, and will live no longer than they can pre&s;erve me. I have in my life been guilty of many follies, but as I think of no meanne&s;s. I will not blot and defile that which is pa&s;t, by endeavouring to provide for the future. I have ever heard in my mind, that &s;hould God ca&s;t me into &s;uch a condition as that I cannot &s;ave my life, but by doing an indecent thing, he &s;hows me the time is come when I &s;hould re&s;ign it; and when I cannot live in my own country, but by &s;uch means as are wor&s;e than dying in it; I think he &s;hows me that I ought to keep my&s;elf out of it.</Q> <HI>See Sydneys Letters.</HI></P>

<P>Moral light is as irre&s;i&s;tible by the mind, as phy&s;ical by the eye. All attempts to impede its progre&s;s are vain.

<P>Surely the experience of all ages &s;hould have taught our rulers, that pro&s;ecutions can never efface principles; and that the thunders of the &s;tate will prove impotent when weighed again&s;t patrioti&s;m, innocence, and firmne&s;s.

<P>To be torn a bleeding member from that country which we love, is indeed, upon the fir&s;t view painful in the extreme; but all things cea&s;e to be painful, when we are &s;upported by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that we have done our duty to our fellow creatures? and a wi&s;e man ri|&s;ing &s;uperior to all local prejudices, if a&s;ked for his country will turn his eyes from <Q>this dim &s;pot which men call earth, and will point, like Anaxagoras, to the Heavens.</Q> MILTON.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, my cau&s;e is in your hand.&mdash;You are Britons&mdash;You are freemen.&mdash;Nothing more therefore is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid.

<P>Gentlemen of the jury, you have heard a great deal, and I will
<PB N="188" REF="027591_0188_0FD54CFDC1DE6C90">
not keep you much longer, becau&s;e I con&s;ider it as very unnece&s;&s;ary, in &s;peaking to gentlemen of your found &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding; you have given very particular attention, and are as able to judge of it as I am. The libel has been found relevant, after the mo&s;t delibe|rate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, by coun&s;el at great length; and it was al&s;o con&s;idered very fully from the bench: it was found relevant to infer the pains of law, and is now &s;ubmitted to you, to try whether the pannel is guilty of the crime libelled, yea or no.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the crime charged is &s;edition, and a very heinous crime it is; and nothing can &s;trike more at the peace and quiet of &s;ociety, and indeed it tends to &s;ubvert &s;ociety altogether. The pub|lic pro&s;ecutor, in ju&s;tice to the pannel, that he might be prepared for his defence, has charged different facts and circum&s;tances, from which he infers the crime of &s;edition, and the libel concludes, <Q>all which, or part thereof, being found proven, he ought to be puni&s;hed with the pains of law,</Q> which in this ca&s;e is an arbitrary puni&s;hment: the meaning of this is, that although the public pro&s;ecutor libels a variety of facts and circum&s;tances, yet, if he brings a proof of &s;uch facts and circum&s;tances as you &s;hall be of opinion &s;ufficiently &s;upports the charge of &s;edition, you will find the pannel guilty, or the libel proven; and, if you think there is nothing to &s;ub&s;tantiate the charge, you will find the libel not proven, or find the pannel not guilty.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the fir&s;t thing you have to enquire into is, whether you think that meeting that denominated it&s;elf <Q>The Briti&s;h Con|vention of the Delegates of the People a&s;&s;ociated to obtain Uni|ver&s;al Suffrage and Annual Parliaments</Q> was a &s;editious meeting; and if you think it is not a &s;editious meeting, then, to be &s;ure, you will acquit the pannel, becau&s;e what is charged again&s;t him is, the part he took in that &s;editious meeting; but if you think it is a &s;edi|tious meeting, then you will enquire whether the pannel is acce&s;&s;ary art and part or not.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, as to the fir&s;t que&s;tion, how far there is evidence to e|&s;tabli&s;h this convention of delegates to be a &s;editious meeting it will occur to your&s;elves. Gentlemen, that there has been already, no le&s;s than two of your fellow-&s;ubjects convicted of the crime of &s;edition, as members of that convention, and accordingly condemned to tran&s;|portation, and that there are other two indicted for the &s;ame crime, but did not think proper to &s;tand their trial, and they accordingly &s;tand fugitated by a judgment of this Court, Mr. Callander and Mr. Scott; you have, therefore, gentlemen, the verdicts of two very re&s;pectable juries &s;tamping upon this meeting the character of &s;edi|tious.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it has been &s;aid, and much in&s;i&s;ted upon, that it is contrary to the rights of mankind, in general, not to be allowed to apply to parliament. I don't &s;ay that is a criminal act, if it re&s;ted there alone; but, Gentlemen, I would &s;ubmit to your own feelings, it is not a matter that re&s;ts upon evidence, but upon your own feel|ings,
<PB N="189" REF="027591_0189_0FD54CFF2284B738">
as men, as members of &s;ociety, and as &s;ubjects of this kingdom, whether you feel any grievances that this country labours under, that &s;hould entitle them to make &s;uch a cry again&s;t the government of the country: for my own part (and I appeal to your own feel|ings if it is not a ju&s;t ob&s;ervation,) I have always con&s;idered this coun|try as the envy of the world at large, as the happie&s;t kingdom upon face of the earth; and I &s;ubmit to you, whether or not as much hap|pine&s;s does not exi&s;t in this kingdom as ever did? Every man is &s;ure of enjoying every thing he has in perfect &s;ecurity: his life is &s;ecure, and his liberty is &s;ecure, by the laws of the country, and his proper|ty is al&s;o &s;ecure; he is ab&s;olutely certain that nothing will be taken from him that he has any right to enjoy.</P>
<P>And I &s;ubmit it to you, whether or not even if there had been ground for complaints, it was a proper time to bring forward tho&s;e complaints; at a time when we were involved in a war with a fero|cious and cruel nation, at pre&s;ent &s;etting the re&s;t of Europe at defi|ance, and when the greate&s;t unanimity, among the &s;ubjects of this kingdom, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to put an end to that war; I &s;ubmit to you, whether any good member of &s;ociety, would prefer his com|plaint again&s;t the government of the country at &s;uch a time. But if you feel as I feel, that the complaints are groundle&s;s, and that the country is living in a &s;tate of tranquility, &s;ecure of their lives and properties again&s;t every attack whatever; I &s;ubmit to you, whether is that man innocent who calls the people together, and impre&s;&s;es their minds with ideas ho&s;tile to the government of the country, with ideas of mal-admini&s;tration on the part of the king, the parliament, and the admini&s;trators of public affairs, to impre&s;s their minds with an idea that all is corrupt, and that a reform is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, by annual parliaments and univer&s;al &s;uffrage, a thing that never can be obtained by the con&s;ent of Parliament; and if you con&s;ider a moment, I am very &s;ure that if the people were to obtain it, they would them&s;elves feel the bad effects of it before a twelve month was over, and they would be glad to have the old con&s;titu|tion re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; and therefore, if per&s;ons call &s;uch meetings of the people together, I &s;ubmit to you, whether that is innocent, when the con&s;equence is alienating their affections from the king and con&s;titution, and from the government of the country, exciting them to ri&s;e up, and overturn the government by &s;uperior force?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is &s;aid, that the de&s;cription of their meetings call|ing them&s;elves citizens, dividing them&s;elves into &s;ections, making conventions of emergency, &s;ecret committees, and all the re&s;t of it, are innocent things in them&s;elves; and I don't think his maje&s;ty's Advocate has laid them as a crime unconnected with any other cir|cum&s;tance; but, gentlemen, the text is always be&s;t under&s;tood by the context; you are not to take this paragraph in the indictment by it&s;elf, but from the whole as laid and as proved you are to judge of the meaning and intention of the parties here; and when you find meetings e&s;tabli&s;hed in this country under denominations never
<PB N="190" REF="027591_0190_0FD7BF762D5BD100">
before known, as committees of emergency, of organization, of finance, and all the re&s;t of it; when you &s;ee that a&s;&s;umed at a pe|riod when we are in an open declared war with France, when we ken that is borrowed from the convention of France, and when you compare it with the whole of their conduct, particularly the re&s;o|lutions of that meeting and the &s;peeches, I &s;ay you will con&s;ider, whether upon a fair con&s;truction of the whole, they were not imi|tating France in the form of their government, and that the object of their meeting was, like France, to overturn the e&s;tabli&s;hed con|&s;titution, and put every thing upon the &s;ame footing with France, where ari&s;tocracy is reviled, the king reviled, and indeed where there is no con&s;titution at all. That, gentlemen, is the great ob|ject of your enquiry; and when you attend to the whole of the re|&s;olutions and motions, as they appear upon the face of the minutes which were recovered out of the hands of their own &s;ecretary, and compare them with the papers found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Margarot, Sinclair, and Gerrald, and al&s;o, with the parole evidence that has been given in this ca&s;e, you will judge whether upon the whole it does not appear to you, that the&s;e people were imitating the French Convention, and that they meant to follow the &s;pirit of the French, in e&s;tabli&s;hing their form of government.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, there are a number of &s;editious re&s;olutions and &s;peeches in this indictment, and one of them a very capital one, which I think borders as near upon high trea&s;on as any thing I ever &s;aw: "That this convention, con&s;idering the calamitous con|&s;equences of any act of the legi&s;lature which may tend to deprive the whole, or any part of the people, of their undoubted right to meet, either by them&s;elves or by delegation, to di&s;cu&s;s any matter relative to their common intere&s;t, whether of a public or a pri|vate nature, and holding the &s;ame to be totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the fir&s;t principles and &s;afety of &s;ociety, and al&s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of our known and acknowledged con&s;titutional liberties, do hereby de|clare, before God and the world, that we &s;hall follow the whole|&s;ome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which &s;hall militate again&s;t the con&s;titution of our country; and &s;hall continue to a&s;&s;emble, and con&s;ider of the be&s;t means by which we can accompli&s;h a real Repre&s;entation of the People and Annu|al Election, until compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force." The language of this re&s;olution is too plain to need any illu&s;tration&mdash;it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that they meant to carry any thing by &s;trength of arms; for what could &s;uch a &s;mall number do again&s;t the mili|tary force of this country&mdash;twenty one is the number to precede the action; but that is not the number of people to be engaged in this action, for they were only the delegates of the people; and it appears that the&s;e delegates, when they opened their &s;ecret let|ters, were to convene their con&s;tituents and repair to the place of meeting. I hope there were not many of them; but if they had been allowed to go on, I dare &s;ay, they would have been found
<PB N="191" REF="027591_0191_0FD54D02E97A0EA8">
to be the repre&s;entatives of a great many more than I could wi&s;h for.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, when you con&s;ider the whole of this re&s;olu|tion, and the &s;peeches, and the &s;ealed letter to be given to each de|legate, the contents of which is not to be known, and when the very emergency has happened upon which they were to meet (for the landing of foreign troops is one of them), is it po&s;&s;ible for you to believe that it was merely a reform in parliament that they in|tended? If it was, there was no occa&s;ion for any &s;ecrecy at all: but on the other hand, if a ri&s;ing of the people was intended, then I con|ceive that a committee of &s;ecrecy, and a convention of emergency is nece&s;&s;ary and prudent, and the idea of a reform in parliament is all non&s;en&s;e; for if that was their intention, they would have made their application openly to parliament, and parliament would have granted or withheld their petition.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is very obervable that there is a blank in the mi|nutes; now in order to &s;upply that, there is a paper recovered from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Charles Sinclair, "That in ca&s;e the mi|ni&s;ter, or any other member of either Hou&s;e of Parliament, bring forward a motion for leave to bring in a Convention Bill, &s;uch as was pa&s;&s;ed in Ireland, to prevent the people from meeting ac|cording to their ju&s;t rights by the Revolution, the &s;ame motion &s;hall be notice to the delegates to meet in convention to a&s;&s;ert their rights."</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is &s;aid, that this paper is not authenticated, and to be &s;ure, if you think it is not you will lay it out of your con&s;i|deration: but in the fir&s;t place, it was found in Mr. Sinclair's chamber, tied up in a handkerchief, and brought in a chai&s;e along with Mr Gerrald and Mr. Margarot to the &s;heriff-clerk's office Mr. Mack generally had the keeping of the papers there; &s;ays he, I don't think I was there when the papers were brought in, but I came in very &s;oon after; the examinations were going on, and it was put into my hand, the handkerchief was laid upon the &s;heriff-clerk's table, the &s;heriff was &s;itting there, and the clerks, the pro|curator-fi&s;cal and &s;o on. It it po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e per&s;ons all men of character, would do that, in order to convict an inno|cent man, for which they ought to be hanged, by extracting evi|dence and putting fal&s;e evidence in its place? Mack &s;ays, that he locked it up, and it was under his lock and key till it was opened and inventoried in pre&s;ence of Sinclair him&s;elf, and other per&s;ons. This paper is marked at the back by Aitche&s;on, and Aitche&s;on told you, that he acted as a&s;&s;i&s;tant &s;ecretary, &s;o that this paper is endor&s;ed by Aitche&s;on in character of &s;ecretary to the convention, and afterwards found in Sinclair's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as he was the mover I think of the amendments upon Callander's motion. But, Gen|tlemen, that is not all, for here are two or three witne&s;&s;es tell you preci&s;ely that it was debated in the convention, and re&s;olved on, that in certain ca&s;es this convention of emergency were to meet,
<PB N="192" REF="027591_0192_0FD54D0473AD6A78">
and one of tho&s;e ca&s;es is, if any bill &s;hould be brought into parlia|ment &s;imilar to that which pa&s;&s;ed in the parliament of Ireland, and this is confirmed by the evidence of more than one or two witne&s;&s;es. Why, Gentlemen, this paper &s;o well authenticated, found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Charles Sinclair, brought to the &s;heriff-clerk's office, committed to the care of the gentleman who is the u&s;ual keeper of the papers in that office, and kept under his lock and key till they were opened before Mr. Sinclair him&s;elf, I &s;ubmit to you whe|ther that is not very good evidence, that this paper (which is of the highe&s;t importance, and which borders upon high trea&s;on) is &s;ufficiently authenticated to your &s;atisfaction; and indeed gentle|men, there is a great deal more than that, becau&s;e there is even Mr. Gerrald's fir&s;t &s;peech, which is at &s;uch great length in the in|dictment, of which Cockburn &s;wears that he recollects that a num|ber of paragraphs in it were delivered in the meeting, and he does not pretend to &s;ay that there is any thing materially different in the paper from what he heard in the meeting; though he will not iden|tify the whole of it, he did not &s;ee any thing remarkably erroneous in it; that is, he could not &s;ay it was verbatim the &s;ame, but in point of &s;ub&s;tance he could not di&s;cover any difference. Then, Gentlemen, there is William Ro&s;s, a member of the convention, who writes the &s;hort hand, he &s;wears he took this &s;peech down in &s;hort-hand, and from that publi&s;hed it in the Gazetteer, and the public pro&s;ecutor copied it from the Gazetteer: this is pretty good evidence to &s;hew that that &s;peech was delivered in that meeting. This is the &s;peech, "I ri&s;e to congratulate the convention," <HI>&amp;c. (reads from the in|dictment.)</HI></P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, in the fir&s;t place, this is publi&s;hed in the Ga|zetteer, and taken by the public pro&s;ecutor <HI>verbatim</HI> from the Gazet|teer, and is confirmed by the parole evidence, as al&s;o by the minutes of the convention, where you will find the &s;ub&s;tance of it; and I &s;ubmit to you whether there is not &s;ufficient matter to e&s;tabli&s;h this meeting to be a &s;editious meeting; and if you are &s;atisfied that it is a &s;editious meeting, the next que&s;tion is, whether this pannel is guilty, actor, or art and part in the proceedings of &s;uch meeting.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the concluding of the libel is, that if he is found guil|ty, actor, or art and part of the crimes charged, that is &s;ufficient to in&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the pains of law; and the law is, that if any unlawful act is committed where a number are concerned, one per&s;on may be more active in the commi&s;&s;ion of the fact than others, but in the eye of the law they are all con&s;idered as guilty, art and part in the crime charg|ed, and all liable to &s;uffer the pains of law.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have anticipated a good deal of the evidence upon this head already. When you &s;ee Mr. Gerrald taking a very active, part and making &s;peeches, &s;uch as you have heard to day, I look upon him as a very dangerous member of &s;ociety, for I dare &s;ay he has elo|quence enough to per&s;uade the people to ri&s;e in arms.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> Oh my lord!&mdash;My lord, this is a very improper

way of addre&s;&s;ing a jury, it is de&s;cending to per&s;onal abu&s;e. God forbid that my eloquence &s;hould be ever made u&s;e of for &s;uch a pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Mr. Gerrald, I don't &s;ay that you did &s;o, but that you had abilities to do it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, he has no relation, nor the lea&s;t property in the coun|try, but he comes here to di&s;turb the peace of the country, as a dele|gate from a &s;ociety in England to rai&s;e &s;edition in this country: I &s;ay, he appears to me, to be much more criminal than Muir, or Pal|mer, or Skirving, becau&s;e they were all natives of this country.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, if you are &s;atisfied that this meeting is a &s;editious meet|ing, I don't &s;ee how it is po&s;&s;ible to avoid the con&s;equence of finding this pannel, guilty art and part of the crime charged: but, Gentle|men, it is not my verdict that is to be returned, you will return &s;uch a verdict as your own con&s;ciences will direct.</P>

<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Gentlemen, I am perfectly &s;atisfied that you have given that attention to this ca&s;e which it de&s;erved; and now you are at liberty to go about your bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Gerrald, now is your time to &s;peak, if you have any thing to &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gillies.</HI> My lords, I have an objection to &s;tate to this verdict. I need &s;carcely &s;ay that I mean no reflection upon the gentlemen of the jury who have delivered in the verdict, and who, I have no doubt meant to di&s;charge their duty con&s;cientiou&s;ly, to the be&s;t of their knowledge. I &s;tate this objection with the more confidence, that it is not &s;o much an objection to the words or to the form, as to the &s;ub&s;tance of the verdict. It is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary by the laws of this, and every other country, that the jury &s;hould con&s;ider the whole
<PB N="194" REF="027591_0194_0FD7BF4F5D025C70">
evidence before them; and &s;o much is this the ca&s;e, that even if they do con&s;ider it, yet if the verdict does not expre&s;sly bear that they did &s;o, your lord&s;hip knows better than I do that &s;uch a verdict is void. This verdict bears that the jury have <Q>con&s;idered the cri|minal libel rai&s;ed and pur&s;ued by his maje&s;ty's Advocate, for his maje&s;ty's intere&s;t, again&s;t Jo&s;eph Gerrald, pannel, the interlocutor of relevancy pronounced thereupon by the Court, and the evidence adduced in proof of the libel.</Q></P>
<P>My lord, they ought al&s;o to have con&s;idered the defence which was &s;tated, and the evidence adduced or referred to, on the part of the pannel; and they not only ought to have con&s;idered the&s;e in fact, but their verdict ought to have &s;tated, that they did con&s;ider this evi|dence, and that they did take into con&s;ideration this defence.</P>
<P>But, my lords, this is not all. In a common ca&s;e I know well, that, if a verdict is returned to your lord&s;hips, &s;tating that the jury have con&s;idered the evidence before them, no proof can be received that they have not con&s;idered that evidence. It mu&s;t be taken for granted that the jury have con&s;idered it, as the verdict &s;tates that they have done &s;o. The evidence of the verdict it&s;elf cannot in the common ca&s;e be re-argued, becau&s;e I cannot be permitted to lead a proof of what pa&s;&s;ed among the jury after they were inclo&s;ed. No &s;uch proof can be received, in oppo&s;ition to what the verdict it&s;elf bears. But what is the ca&s;e here? There was here a mo&s;t volumi|nous body of written evidence laid upon this table: the&s;e writings, it was admitted by the candour of the public pro&s;ecutor, might, and I will be bold to &s;ay, did contain much evidence in favour of the unfor|tunate gentleman at your lord&s;hips bar. This written evidence con|&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal hundred pages, which could not have been read in le&s;s than &s;ix or &s;even hours. I mu&s;t &s;ay therefore, in point of fact, that the jury neither did, nor could con&s;ider the great body of writ|ten evidence that was laid before them. If I &s;aw man in this room la&s;t night, and if I &s;ee him here again this morning, I cannot believe that he has been at Botany Bay in the interim; in the &s;ame manner, if a jury inclo&s;e for twenty minutes, and afterwards return and &s;ay they have con&s;idered the body of written evidence, which it mu&s;t have taken &s;everal hours to con&s;ider, I cannot believe them: we know that the fact mu&s;t be otherwi&s;e; and the proof which I of|fer is complete, that the jury were only inclo&s;ed for twenty minutes, a &s;pace of time in which it was not po&s;&s;ible for them to have read the evidence which was laid before them, and which it was their duty to con&s;ider. It was the more nece&s;&s;ary for the jury to have con&s;idered this body of written evidence, becau&s;e the pannel did not take the advantage of a coun&s;el to &s;tate his defence; and, however great his talents may be, he is not, he cannot be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that legal know|ledge and of tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ional habits nece&s;&s;ary to enable any man to comment upon evidence. It was &s;till the more nece&s;&s;ary for them to con&s;ider this written evidence, as the public pro&s;ecutor admitted before them, that it might contain a great deal of exculpatory proof,
<PB N="195" REF="027591_0195_0FD54D08E394FE58">
upon con&s;idering which, I am entitled to conclude, that the jury would either have found this gentleman not guilty, or have returned a &s;pecial verdict, finding part of the crime libelled on proved, and part not proved. I need not enlarge upon what I have now &s;tated. The jury were bound by every principle of ju&s;tice, by every rule of law to con&s;ider this evidence; and I offer to prove, that they did not con&s;ider it, that they were inclo&s;ed only twenty minutes, a &s;pace of time in which it was impo&s;&s;ible for any human being to con&s;ider it.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> My lords, I &s;hall trouble you with a very few words in an&s;wer to the objections &s;tated by my brother. The fir&s;t is, that the verdict does not &s;pecially bear that the jury had con|&s;idered the evidence on the part of the pannel. It is a pretty good an&s;wer to that, that there was no evidence adduced on the part of the pannel; the only evidence that was adduced, was on the part of the pro&s;ecutor, upon which evidence the pannel was willing his de|fence &s;hould re&s;t. The next objection is, that the verdict bears that they have con&s;idered the evidence adduced in proof of the libel, when it was impo&s;&s;ible they could have done &s;o, from the time that they were inclo&s;ed. My lord, it was perfectly unnece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould con&s;ider every word of this voluminous body of evidence. The evidence which I founded upon on the part of the pro&s;ecution could be con&s;idered in five minutes, as well as in five years. And as to the pannel, I do not remember that he founded upon any one part of it; and if he did, I am &s;ure the jury had a perfect opportunity of con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Clerk.</HI> My lords, I &s;hall trouble your lord&s;hips with but few words, and before I begin, I mu&s;t take the liberty of making the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion that Mr. Gillies did, that I have no doubt but this jury meant to di&s;charge their duty mo&s;t con&s;cientiou&s;ly and mo&s;t faithfully; but a jury of the mo&s;t hone&s;t as well as faithful men may be mi&s;taken in the di&s;charge of that duty.</P>
<P>My lords, I mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place &s;peak with re&s;pect to what Mr. Solicitor General &s;aid, that there was no evidence adduced on the part of the pannel. It is true there was not; but he made a de|fence, and a very long and able defence it was, and there is nothing in that verdict which &s;hews that the jury have taken that evidence into con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>With regard to the next point, it is very true that the mo&s;t mate|rial parts of that evidence might have been comprehended in a very &s;mall compa&s;s; but how was this matter to be determined? It could only be determined by reading over the whole of the evidence; and the more &s;o, becau&s;e the greater part of that evidence was in|competent to be produced, and ought not to have been produced, in|a&s;much as they referred to a period long before the pannel had any connection with the convention. My lords, the public pro&s;ecutor him&s;elf &s;aid it might comprehend a great deal of exculpatory matter &mdash;after that conce&s;&s;ion was it not their duty to read through that evidence in order to di&s;cover that exculpatory matter? My lords
<PB N="196" REF="027591_0196_0FD7BF77ADC9F450">
it is &s;aid that he did not found upon the&s;e papers: it is true he did not; but he made a defence of three hours and a half, in which he exhau&s;ted him&s;elf upon other &s;ubjects, leaving it to the jury, tru&s;ting that they would &s;upply the defects of his evidence, and that they would con&s;ider the written evidence lying before them.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> What do your lord&s;hips &s;ay to this?</P>
<P><HI>Lord Henderland.</HI> My lord, the jury in returning their verdict were not bound to &s;ay any thing farther than that upon con&s;idering the evidence they found &s;o and &s;o. With re&s;pect to the pannel's defence, he was fully heard, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e it was not con&s;idered. With re&s;pect to the evidence that was lying upon the table, they have formed an opinion, a con&s;titutional opinion, which they were entitled to form, and we are bound to pre&s;ume that it was partly formed upon that evidence.</P>
<P><HI>Lord E&s;kgrove.</HI> My lord, I think, that with re&s;pect to this ver|dict, the jury have returned a very proper verdict; for my lord, it is neither nece&s;&s;ary nor cu&s;tomary to &s;ay, that they con&s;idered the ar|guments u&s;ed, either on one &s;ide or the other&mdash;if they had &s;aid that they had con&s;idered what the pannel had &s;aid at the bar they mu&s;t al&s;o have &s;tated that they had con&s;idered what his maje&s;ty's Solicitor General had &s;tated in &s;upport of the charge. They are &s;uppo&s;ed to have con&s;idered both, but it is not cu&s;tomary to &s;tate more than they have here &s;tated; you mu&s;t believe that the jury con&s;idered every thing proved and every thing &s;tated on both &s;ides. As to what time they took I know not, nor is it my duty to enquire; they would take as much time as they thought proper; they have decla|red that they did &s;o; and I am of opinion that there is no relevancy in the objection.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Swinton.</HI> My lord, the jury have &s;tated in this verdict, that they con&s;idered all that was laid before them, the libel, the interlo|cutor of relevancy, and the evidence. It is not u&s;ual for them to &s;ay that they have con&s;idered the arguments. As to the time that they took to con&s;ider we have no right to enquire: they could look at the material parts of the evidence in a very few minutes; and whether they looked at it or not we have no bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire, if it was on their memory it was &s;ufficient. I am convinced that they have acted hone&s;tly and faithfully, as they were bound by their religion and their oath to do.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Dun&s;innan.</HI> My lord, an intelligent and re&s;pectable jury have, upon their great oath, returned a verdict bearing to proceed upon the evidence, and the only evidence that was laid before them, which was the evidence in &s;upport of the pro&s;ecution: every body pre&s;ent knows that there was none offered on the part of the pan|nel, and they could not con&s;ider evidence which was not laid before them. As to what fell from the pannel, they have no doubt con&s;i|dered it; and they have returned a verdict which appears to me a very proper one.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Abercrombie.</HI> I am of the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="027591_0197_0FD7BF533B484CD0"><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> My lords, I &s;hould have been very much &s;ur|pri&s;ed if this pannel &s;hould be acquitted upon a blunder in a verdict; but the verdict appears to me to be mo&s;t unexceptionable, and the objection is founded in a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of the ca&s;e altogether: the pannel and his coun&s;el declared they had not any proof; if they had any proof by parole evidence, it was their duty to have brought it forward, and if they had meant to have founded upon the written e|vidence on the table, they ought to have pointed out what parts of that evidence they meant to found upon; and therefore you mu&s;t con&s;ider that he had no evidence to bring in exculpation, and all that the jury had to con&s;ider, was the evidence on the part of the pro&s;e|cution. The public pro&s;ecutor libels upon a bundle of papers, and becau&s;e two or three hundred pages of writing are produced and all, ten lines of that is nece&s;&s;ary to found upon in &s;upport of the charge, can it be nece&s;&s;ary that the jury &s;hould go through it all? In ca&s;es of forgery it may be nece&s;&s;ary to produce very long writings, and per|haps only two or three lines of it may be founded upon for the &s;up|port of the charge; but can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that it is nece&s;&s;ary for the jury to read over the whole of it? The thing is too gro&s;s to be li&s;|tened to by any court whatever. The jury con&s;idered all that it was nece&s;&s;ary for them to con&s;ider; they con&s;idered the libel, the inter|locutor of relevancy, and the proof on the part of the pro&s;ecutor. Then they &s;ay there was a long defence, and they &s;hould have &s;tat|ed that they had con&s;idered that,&mdash;My lords, the jury did their duty in not con&s;idering that defence: it was a defence again&s;t the rele|vancy of the indictment, and the fir&s;t two hours of this &s;peech went to &s;hew that all that he had done was innocent. But, my lords, was it not offered to the Court in a very long pleading and found rele|vant? I apprehend the jury have done their duty properly: they have a power to be &s;ure, if they think proper, even after the libel is found relevant, they may acquit, but the duty of a jury and of a judge are di&s;tinct; it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Court to determine the law as to the relevancy of the libel, and of the jury to judge of the fact; and as it was found relevant by the Court, the jury had no more to do but to con&s;ider the evidence, and in my opinion, they have returned a ve|ry proper verdict, finding the pannel guilty.</P>
<P>Mr. Gerrald, if you have any thing to &s;ay, now is the time.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gerrald.</HI> My lord, I have very little to &s;ay. I am as little hurt, as I am &s;urpri&s;ed at the verdict returned, ina&s;much as I find that the public pro&s;ecutor him&s;elf, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, antici|pated the fate which I was to meet; but my lord, I tru&s;t that a moral and enlightened world, collectively, will do ju&s;tice to the purity of the motives which have actuated my conduct; and I glory in being the advocate of a cau&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which is complicated truth, ju&s;tice and freedom, which I know <HI>mu&s;t</HI> and <HI>will</HI> ultimately triumph.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> Your lord&s;hips will now proceed to give your
<PB N="198" REF="027591_0198_0FD7BF546DB18A50">
opinions upon the puni&s;hment which you think in this ca&s;e ought to be inflicted.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Henderland.</HI> My lord, the pannel at the bar is found guilty of the crime libelled, which is &s;edition. And my lord, after the very able argument and &s;ound con&s;titutional law which you heard from the Solicitor General, it would be highly improper in me, as it would be irk&s;ome to your lord&s;hips that I &s;hould enlarge upon the nature of this charge.</P>
<P>My lord, we are to con&s;ider of the puni&s;hment due to that crime, of which we have had &s;o many mi&s;erable examples before us, that I can propo&s;e nothing el&s;e but this, that the pri&s;oner &s;hall be recom|mitted to pri&s;on, and there to remain till an opportunity &s;hall offer for carrying the &s;entence that I propo&s;e &s;hall be pronounced again&s;t him of bani&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nt by tran&s;portation, for the &s;pace of fourteen years, into execution.</P>
<P>My lord, it appears to me, that by no means an adequate puni&s;h|ment can be inflicted for this offence; and even if this has the ap|pearance of &s;everity, which I cannot think it has, it is the only judgment that could be pronounced in &s;uch a ca&s;e, to &s;ecure the &s;afety of this country from the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch crimes. I am convinced that the people of this country, who are an intelli|gent, an acute, and a &s;en&s;ible people, however much they may be led away by &s;editions per&s;ons, when they come to re&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t cool|ly, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately, and fairly, upon the nature of this crime, up|on the danger that ari&s;es from the commi&s;&s;ion of it, and up|on the &s;ecurity and the &s;afety they enjoy, by the exerci&s;e of that di&s;cretionary power, which is ve&s;ted in this Court by law, will be of opinion that the judgment we pronounce this day is a ju&s;t and a pro|per one.</P>
<P><HI>Lord E&s;kgrove.</HI> My lord, I am extremely happy, that this gen|tleman has had a full and a fair trial, and that he has acted with the propriety of calling in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of able coun&s;el, who have done hohour to them&s;elves, and ju&s;tice to their client; and my lord, I un|der&s;tand (for my &s;tate of health did not permit me to remain in Court the whole of the time) that the gentleman him&s;elf is a man of great abilities, and that he was indulged by the Court, in &s;tating every thing that he wi&s;hed to &s;tate. My lord, I apprehend, that after the arguments we have heard, there can be no doubt that this Court, by the law of this country, whatever it may be in other countries, are au|thori&s;ed to inflict the puni&s;hment of bani&s;hment by tran&s;portation, and that this is the only proper puni&s;hment that can be inflicted for the crime here charged, to prevent others from committing the &s;ame crime, and to keep peace and tranquility within this part of the kingdom. And, my lord, in con&s;equence of what your lord&s;hips have uniformly pronounced upon ca&s;es of this kind (which I am heartily &s;orry there has been occa&s;ion for). I cannot &s;ee any thing in this ca&s;e that could authori&s;e me to deviate from the &s;ame
<PB N="199" REF="027591_0199_0FD54D10C19B54C8">
mode of puni&s;hment that your lord&s;hips have inflicted in the other ca&s;es.</P>
<P>My lord, as to this verdict of the jury, by which he is found guilty, taking under con&s;ideration all the circum&s;tances, I am of the &s;ame opinion that has been given by my honourable bre|thren.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Swinton.</HI> My lord, in con&s;idering this crime about which your lord&s;hips have heard &s;o much, the more I con&s;ider, and the more I turn my mind to it, the more I am convinced that this Court did right originally in impo&s;ing the &s;entence that they did impo&s;e. My lord, in con&s;idering this ca&s;e, and comparing the pu|ni&s;hment with the crime, I hardly know what puni&s;hment is ade|quate to it. It was well &s;aid by one of the able&s;t and greate&s;t men that ever lived, that &s;edition was like Pandora's box, it contains e|very evil, it contains, every vice. My lord, it is &s;aid, that he is to be &s;ent among pickpockets, thieves and robbers, but my lord, this crime is not to be compared with theirs, it comprehends every &s;ort of crime, murder, robbery, rape, every thing that is criminal. I think, my lord, the puni&s;hment has been propo&s;ed is the milde&s;t that can be inflicted, and I hope will be &s;ufficient to deter others from committing the &s;ame crime.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Dun&s;innan.</HI> My lord, the crime of which this unhappy man now &s;tands convicted, is a crime for which, within a few months, two per&s;ons have been tried at that bar. who have been convicted, and upon tho&s;e convictions, the court have pronounc|ed the judgment of the law. My lord it would give me great plea&s;ure if there were any circum&s;tances in the ca&s;e of this pan|nel that could di&s;tingui&s;h it favourably from tho&s;e upon which we have had occa&s;ion to pronounce judgment before; but the cir|cum&s;tances of this ca&s;e tend rather to aggravate it. My lord, he is one of tho&s;e per&s;ons who came into this country, for the purpo&s;e of exciting civil di&s;cord, by inflaming the minds of the people. We have had an opportunity of &s;eeing that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es talents, which render him exceedingly capable of mi&s;chief; the ha|rangue which we heard la&s;t night though addre&s;&s;ed to the jury, was I believe rather intended for another part of this court; we &s;aw that his political principles are extremely dangerous, and my lord, if there is any other country, which does not inflict &s;uch a puni&s;h|ment for &s;uch a crime, I am happy that I live in &s;uch a country as this; and if I were to propo&s;e any difference of puni&s;hment, it would be rather to increa&s;e than dimini&s;h it. I am of opinion, doubt|le&s;s, that the &s;ame puni&s;hment &s;hould be inflicted in this ca&s;e as in the former.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Abercrombie.</HI> My lord, a legal objection was &s;tated to the puni&s;hment now propo&s;ed; that objection was argued with uncom|mon ability, by the learned coun&s;el for the pannel, and your lord|&s;hips gave your judgment upon it. But, my lords, that legal ob|jecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> was grounded upon this, that the puni&s;hment was too &s;evere
<PB N="200" REF="027591_0200_0FD54D98E8A80520">
for the offence of which he &s;tands convicted by the unanimous voice of his country.</P>
<P>My lords, it has been &s;aid, within the&s;e walls, that his intentions all along were innocent, that they were perfectly pure and honourable; and that had the &s;ame crime been committed in England, it would either have pa&s;&s;ed with impurity, or with a very &s;mall puni&s;h|ment as impri&s;onment of pillory. My lord, upon that I &s;hall &s;ay a very few words. With re&s;pect to the pannel's motives, I &s;hall for a ment &s;uppo&s;e that his intentions were pure and perfectly innocent; but even con&s;idering the ca&s;e in that view, I mu&s;t give it as my opi|nion, &s;itting here as a judge&punc; that it would afford no motive for a mitigation of puni&s;hment. My lord, we all know it is a fact, un|doubtedly undeniable that a mi&s;taken principle, either in religion or in politics, has often led the way with the be&s;t of intentions, to com|mit crimes of the deepe&s;t atrocity. My lord, the hi&s;tory of this country affords many in&s;tances and many examples of this kind; for example, in the ca&s;e of the powder plot many of the con&s;pirators were men of character, Sir Everard Digby was one of the mo&s;t ac|compli&s;hed, one of the mo&s;t virtuous men in England, and my lord he was &s;entenced to die as a traitor for the part he took in that plot; and on the eve of his execution he wrote a letter to his wife, in which he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in tho&s;e preci&s;e terms: <Q>Now for my intention, let me tell you that if I had thought there had been the lea&s;t in the plot, I would not have been of it for all the world; and no other cau&s;e drew me to hazard my fortune and life bat zeal to God's religion.</Q></P>
<P>My lord, this letter, written at that fatal period, by a man who was beloved by every per&s;on in Europe, leaves no room to doubt of the &s;incerity of this confe&s;&s;ion. Then my lords, as to this man, who lives at the di&s;tance of two centuries from the commi&s;&s;ion of that crime, will any per&s;on who now hears me &s;ay that the inno|cency of his intention or the purity of his motives ought to be urg|ed as a rea&s;on again&s;t executing that &s;entence?</P>
<P>My lord, I &s;hall ju&s;t take the liberty of &s;tating, though I am &s;orry to give any opinion upon &s;uch a point, upon the mo&s;t cool and deliberate ob&s;ervations, were I called to give my opinion up|on the point, I would &s;ay, that if this con&s;piracy, in which the un|happy man at the bar was an active leader, had been carried into effect; if that con&s;piracy had been followed with entire &s;ucce&s;s, there is not a corner of this kingdom in which a degree of mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s mu&s;t not have followed.</P>
<P>My lord, we have the example of our own times al&s;o; I need not remind your lord&s;hips of 1745 and 1715. when many men, who had acted with the be&s;t intention, died the death of traitors.</P>
<P>My lord, I &s;ay although the pannel could have e&s;tabli&s;hed by the cleare&s;t and the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory evidence, that his intentions were, all along perfectly innocent, and his motives perfectly pure, it would have afforded no ground whatever for mitigation of puni&s;h|ment;
<PB N="201" REF="027591_0201_0FD5237BBB7C2E10">
but I am &s;orry to &s;ay that I can di&s;cover no proof of &s;uch innocence of intention. My lord, we in this world can only judge of the intentions of men from their actions; and viewing the actions of this pannel, no man of the lea&s;t ob&s;ervation can lay his hand up|on his heart and &s;ay, that the evidence affords the &s;malle&s;t proof of &s;uch purity of motive.</P>
<P>My lord, with regard to the other point, it is our province and our duty to judge of this and every other ca&s;e by the law of our country; we have nothing to do with the law of any other coun|try, and I cannot think that the law of England would &s;uffer an offence of this magnitude either to pa&s;s with impunity, or be pu|ni&s;hed with a &s;lighter puni&s;hment; and I heartily concur with the re&s;t of your lord&s;hips in the puni&s;hment that your lord&s;hips have propo&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</HI> My lords, in comparing this ca&s;e with the others I cannot find any thing that can po&s;&s;ibly make it le&s;s criminal. My lord, tran&s;portation is, no doubt, a very &s;evere puni&s;hment; we con&s;ider it as the highe&s;t arbitrary puni&s;hment that the laws of this country can inflict; but I think it is no more than adequate to the offence which has been proved again&s;t this pannel, and of which he has been convicted by the verdict of a very re&s;pectable jury. My lords, I feel for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of convicts as much as any man who hears me: but, my lords, the happine&s;s of the innocent part of mankind requires of us to puni&s;h the guilty and protect the innocent; and we cannot give that protection to the innocent part of &s;ociety unle&s;s we inflict adequate puni&s;hments upon crimes com|mitted again&s;t &s;ociety.</P>
<P>My lords, in all the&s;e ca&s;es, I was very &s;en&s;ible that tran&s;porta|tion was a great puni&s;hment; but, after con&s;idering all the differ|ent puni&s;hments that the laws of this country can inflict, I did not &s;ee any one puni&s;hment we could inflict which could an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of checking this evil, unle&s;s it was by inflicting the pu|ni&s;hment of tran&s;portation alone; any other puni&s;hment would have been a very imperfect one. Simple bani&s;hment from this country is not at all proper; long impri&s;onment is a thing not known in this country, and very hurtful to the country as well, becau&s;e we know a &s;editious per&s;on in pri&s;on may do a great deal of harm. I cannot have the lea&s;t he&s;itation in thinking that the puni&s;hment of tran&s;portation for fourteen years is the lea&s;t that we can inflict in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>My lords, we have heard a great deal of the innocence of his in|tentions; but it was ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by my brother who &s;poke im|mediately before me, that taking his own account of the matter to be ju&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing that he has acted from principle, and that his motives are pure, I do &s;ay that he becomes a more dangerous member of &s;ociety than if his conduct was really criminal, and act|ing from criminal motives. A man acting from criminal motives
<PB N="202" REF="027591_0202_0FD54D12A1CBC778">
is not &s;o dangerous a member of &s;ociety as a man who thinks he is acting from principle; for when a man is &s;o mi&s;guided in his principles he overturn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ociety and government it&s;elf. I &s;ay <HI>&s;olus populi &s;uprema lex,</HI> and it becomes us, let his intention be as pure as they po&s;&s;ibly can be, to remove that man from &s;ociety, and put it out of his power to di&s;&s;eminate the&s;e dangerous principles. I don't know whether his principles are &s;o pure as he profe&s;&s;ed or not, but if they are, I think it ju&s;tifies this puni&s;hment ju&s;t as much as if he had acted from the wor&s;t of motives, and therefore any other pu|ni&s;hment would be in&s;ufficient.</P>

<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>THE ca&s;e of Bailie was quoted on the &s;ame day, by the Lord Ad|vocate in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the Solicitor General, in the Court of Ju&s;ticiary. The &s;entence of the privy-council was appeal|ed to as deci&s;ive, but the ca&s;e it&s;elf was brought forward by &s;urpri&s;e, and has never been fairly &s;tated to the public. Bailie had informed the Duke of Hamilton by letter, that the Duke of Queen&s;berry and the Marquis of Annandale (the former Secretary of State, and the latter Pre&s;ident of the Council) had tampered with him privately, to induce him, by promi&s;es of preferment, to accu&s;e the Duke of Hamil|ton and other noblemen, of a corre&s;pondence with the French Court, and of a con&s;piracy to e&s;tabli&s;h the Pretender on the Throne. The Duke of Hamilton communicated the letter to the Ju&s;tice Clerk, by whom it was divulged to the privy-council, and on the complaint of the Duke of Queen&s;berry and Marquis of Annandale, Bailie was convicted for defamation and lea&s;ing-making. The &s;entence of the privy-council, as extracted from its records, is in the following terms:</P>
<P><Q>Parties and their advocates being heard at the bar and removed, the lords of his maje&s;ty's privy-council have repelled, and hereby repel the dilators proponed by the defenders procurators as &s;aid is, and have found and hereby find the within libel relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment, and proven by the defender's judicial ac|knowledgment at the bar, that the two letters libelled on were all his hand-writt and &s;ub&s;eryved by him, and therefore have de|clared and hereby declare the &s;aid David Bailie to he infamous; and have bani&s;hed and and hereby bani&s;h him furth of the kingdom for-ever; and have al&s;o appointed and hereby appoint and ordain the &s;aid David Bailie to be tran&s;ported to the We&s;t-Indies, and to be in pri&s;on ay and while he be tran&s;ported, and have appointed and ordained and hereby appoint and ordain the &s;aid David Bailie, before he be tran&s;ported, to be &s;et on the pillory at the Trone, and there to &s;tand from eleven to twelve o'clock of the forenoon, and that upon &s;uch a day and in &s;uch a manner as the &s;aid lords of her maje&s;ty's privy-council &s;hall think fit; and the &s;aid David Bai|lie being called in did hear the &s;entence publicly intimated to him accordingly.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="027591_0205_0FD54D1726174050">To tho&s;e acquainted with the hi&s;tory of the period, it will appear extremely probable, that Bailie was &s;acrificed to the political friend|&s;hip of two powerful families. Queen&s;berry had been baffled and defeated in the preceding parliament, where he pre&s;ided as Commi&s;|&s;ioner, and in which the act of &s;ettlement was ignominiou&s;ly rejected. To remove and di&s;credit the heads of the country party, he had ac|tually recour&s;e to a fictitious plot, and employed Fra&s;er of Beaufort, afterwards Lord Lovat, to accu&s;e them of a corre&s;pondence with the Court of St. Germains. (Macpher&s;on's Hi&s;t. Vol, ii. p. 284.) Whe|ther we &s;uppo&s;e that Bailie had been tampered with for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, or with Lockhart (Memoirs p. 76.) that he was employed by his kin&s;man Bailie of Jervi&s;wood to counteract and di&s;credit the Duke of Queen&s;berry's plots, this at lea&s;t is certain, that his &s;entence was carried in council by Queen&s;berry's party, in oppo&s;ition to the Marquis of Tweedale's, and that the whole was a political conte&s;t and deci&s;ion too infamous to con&s;titute a precedent in a court of ju|&s;tice. See Lockhart.</P>
<P>But their &s;entence was never carried into complete execution. Lord Fountainhall, who reports the ca&s;e, ob&s;erves, <Q>David con|ceiving him&s;elf injured; for if he had concealed it, then he might have been overtaken for mi&s;pri&s;ion and not revealing; and now, having di&s;covered it, he is condemned as a defamer and calum|niator, which makes his ca&s;e hard; he re&s;olved to apply to the parliament for reviewing and recon&s;idering the council's &s;entence as iniquitous. And, finding, that by the &s;econd act of parlia|ment, 2795, citations during the rece&s;s and intervals of parliament are to be i&s;&s;ued out by a warrant from the lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion, he had prepared a bill to be given in to the lords, for ordering a re|duction to be rai&s;ed, under their &s;ignet, of the council's &s;entence, for citing the Duke of Queen&s;berry, &amp;c. to appear before the parliament, when it &s;hall meet; but when his lawyers came to con&s;ider the clau&s;e, they thought it imported a previous cognition and trial before the &s;ummons could be granted, by which the lords were &s;ummarily to hear and cogno&s;ce if there was ground for i&s;&s;uing out the &s;ummons demanded; and in regard the &s;e&s;&s;ion was now ri&s;ing, and there was no time for taking &s;uch a previ|ous cognition, therefore the giving in of the bill was forborn.</Q> Fountainhall, Vol. ii. p. 228.</P>
<P>The appeal, as Fountainhall afterwards ob&s;erves, was then relin|qui&s;hed, as it would not &s;top the execution of the &s;entence. Whe|ther it was afterwards lodged is uncertain; but in the &s;ucceeding par|liament Queen&s;berry, when di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from office, joined his &s;trength with the country party, on the expre&s;s condition that no enquiry &s;hould be made into the pretended Scotch plot. (Macpher&s;on, 304.) To liberate Baillie, who, according to Lockhart, had undergone the pillory, an act was pa&s;&s;ed on his petition to parliament, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing any notice of his offence, or his &s;entence, but ordaining him to be relea&s;ed from pri&s;on on procuring bail for 1000 merks Scotts, to ap|pear,
<PB N="206" REF="027591_0206_0FD7BFFC6CEC32C8">
when called, in the High Court of Parliament. Unprinted Acts of Parl. 1704. The execution of the &s;entence was therefore &s;u&s;pended, and he was relea&s;ed in con&s;equence of a compromi&s;e with tho&s;e who pronounced or obtained the &s;entence, and who were con|&s;cious that its exce&s;&s;ive &s;everity, not to &s;ay its illegality, would not bear the te&s;t of a parliamentary examination. He for who&s;e libera|tion parliament thus interpo&s;ed by &s;tatute, mu&s;t have either been re|puted innocent, or the victim of a &s;entence that exceeded the legal mea&s;ure of puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The act it&s;elf is as follows:</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="act">
<HEAD>21 <HI>July,</HI> 1704.</HEAD>
<P>Her maje&s;ty's High Court and the E&s;tates of Parliament having heard the petition of David Bailie, pri&s;oner in the Ca&s;tle of Stirling, humbly &s;heweth unto them, That whereas the petitioner has been a long time in pri&s;on in the Ca&s;tle of Stirling and other places, and that it is extremely prejudicial to his health to continue any longer in pri&s;on, he being reduced to that weakne&s;s and ill &s;tate of health, that he is &s;carce able to walk: and therefore humbly praying, that his grace and the e&s;tates of parliament would ordain him to be &s;et at li|berty, he always enacting him&s;elf to appear when called, as the &s;aid petition bears; which being con&s;idered by her maje&s;ty's court and the e&s;tates fore&s;aid, they, by their interlocutor thereon ordained the pe|titioner to be &s;et at liberty, he finding caution, when called to ap|pear before the parliament. In the terms of which interlocutor, and conform to the 6th act of the 9th &s;e&s;&s;ion of King William's parliament, William Lord Forre&s;ter did before extracting hereof become bound as cautioner and &s;urety for the &s;aid David Bailie, petitioner that he &s;hould, when called, appear before the &s;aid High Court of Parliament, and that under the penalty of 1000 merks Scots money. In re&s;pect whereof her maje&s;ty's High Commi&s;&s;ioner and the &s;aid E&s;tates do or|dain him, the &s;aid David Bailie, to be &s;et at liberty in manner fore&s;aid.</P>

<P>O THOU Governor of the univer&s;e! we rejoice that all times, and in all circum&s;tances, we have liberty to approach THY throne; and that we are a&s;&s;ured that no &s;acrifice is more acceptable to Thee, than that which is made for the relief of the oppre&s;&s;ed.
