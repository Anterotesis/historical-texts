<HEAD>A NARRATIVE Of Part of the LIFE and ADVENTURERS of JOSEPH ANDREWS, Particularly of his PIRACY and the MURDER of Capt. DURYEE and his Com|pany, for which he was tried on the 17th In&s;tant, and condemn'd to be hang'd this Day, the 23d of May, 1769, on the Shore between the Air Furnace and the Town, and his Body afterwards hung in Chains on Bedlow's I&s;land.</HEAD>
<P>JOSEPH ANDREWS, the unhapy Cri|minal who is this Day to &s;uffer Death, was, we hear born in the I&s;land of Madeira, and is now about 40 Years of Age. The Parti|culars of his Life, we have not been able to obtain as he was much upon the Re&s;erve, and as we hear has not made any Confe&s;&s;ion, except of the Crime for which he is this Day to &s;uffer; but as a dying Man, &s;olemnly denies having been guilty of or concerned in any other Murder.</P>
<P>A Neglect of Religion, and all Chri&s;tian Duties, and a free Indulgence of every vicious, Inclination, particu|larly in keeping bad Company, led him from one De|gree of Wickedne&s;s to another, till his Heart was har|dened again&s;t Remor&s;e, and became capable of har|bouring and devi&s;ing the mo&s;t horrid Thoughts and De&s;igns.</P>
<P>In the Month of Augu&s;t 1766, he enter'd him&s;elf on board the Sloop Polly, Roluff Duryee Ma&s;ter, bound from New-York to the We&s;t-Indies. The other Per&s;ons on board were, Peter Demelt, jun. Mate, Nicholas John&s;on and William Harris, Mari|ners &mdash; Cobbs, a Cabbin Boy, and two Gentle|men, Wells Caverley and his Son, Pa&s;&s;engers. Soon after leaving New-York, ob&s;erving the Captain and Pa&s;&s;engers had a good deal of Money, He and John|&s;on formed the De&s;ign of gaining Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it by murdering the People. This De&s;ign they concluded to put in Execution as &s;oon as they &s;hould make the Land, accordingly about 8 Days after, the Night before they expected to get to St. Chri&s;topers, about Midnight, William Harris being at Helm, and the Captain a &s;leep on a Hencoop on Deck, John&s;on with one Blow of an Ax killed him, and he expired with|out a Groan or Struggle. They then in like Man|ner between them murdered the two Pa&s;&s;engers, and Mate with the Ax, and threw the Boy overboard alive. One of them made a Stroke with the Ax at Harris, who ran to the End of the Bow&s;prit with a Knife and declared he would kill the fir&s;t Man that approached him. They then told him if he would join them and &s;wear to be &s;ecret and faithful, he &s;hould be &s;afe, and &s;hare the Plunder with them, for John&s;on having formerly &s;ail'd with him, pretended to have a Regard for him; but it was previou&s;ly agreed between John&s;on and Andrews to kill him be|fore they got a&s;hore. Harris then came into the Ve&s;&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in throwing the Bodies overboard; after which they broke open the Captain's and Pa&s;|&s;engers Che&s;ts and Lockers, got a Bottle of Wine, and drank Damnation to them&s;elves and each other if they di&s;covered the Secret. They then got a Bible and made Harris &s;wear upon it that he would not betray them; 3 or 4 Days after this, being in Sight of Land, and &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els appearing, they got out the Boat, put into it two Che&s;ts, with what|ever they thought proper to take, &s;cuttled the Ve&s;&s;el, left her, and &s;ail'd towards the Land, telling Harris to &s;teer clear of the Shore. But he telling them if they did not get pretty near the Land the Current would drive them to the Leeward of all the I&s;lands, they left him to &s;teer as he thought be&s;t,&mdash;but intended to throw him overboard before he got to Land. After &s;ome Time John&s;on and Andrews both fell a&s;leep, when Harris &s;tripping him&s;elf, took the Opportunity to throw overboard, without Noi&s;e, both the Oars and his Clothes, when unhanging and dropping the Rudder overboard, he gently let him&s;elf down into the Sea and &s;wam on Shore at St. Kitts, where he gave a blind &s;u&s;picious Account of him&s;elf, being afraid to &s;ay any Thing that might break his Oath of Secrecy; but at la&s;t he applied to a Mini&s;ter for Advice how a Man ought to act in a Ca&s;e &s;imilar to his own. The Mini&s;ter convinced him that &s;uch Kinds of Oaths were to far from being binding, that it would be highly criminal to keep them. He then went before the Judge Surrogate of the Admiralty and gave his Depo&s;ition of all the Circum&s;tances he knew of the bloody Affair. Soon after he quitted the Boat, the irregular tumbling of it waked the two Criminals, who &s;aw their de&s;pe|rate Situation, and were enraged they had not an Opportunity to &s;atiate their Revenge upon Harris. They at fir&s;t endeavour'd to &s;teer with their Hate, but aftewards did it more effectually with their Sprit, and by that Means got to Eu&s;tatia, where they &s;old the Boat.</P>
<P><PB REF="011151_0002_0F857DBFF0B1D200">Some Days after their Arrival, the St. Chri&s;to|pher's Gazette with Harris's Depo&s;ition, made its Appearance in Eu&s;tatia, Andrews happening to &s;ee it, immediately left the I&s;land, in a Ve&s;&s;el bound to Ca&s;co Bay. The Governor of St. Eu&s;tatia, on &s;eeing the Depo&s;ition, publi&s;h'd by Proclamation an Order for a deligent Search, and that no Per&s;on &s;hould car|ry the Criminals off, under the Penalty of 50,000 Pieces of Eight: He al&s;o di&s;patched a Ve&s;&s;el after Andrews, with a proper Notification of the Charge again&s;t him, and De&s;cription of his Per&s;on. John|&s;on was &s;oon taken up at Eu&s;tatia, confe&s;&s;ed the Facts, and was executed on the 15th of November, 1766, by being broke a live on the Rack, he was &s;tretched naked on a Cro&s;s, where the Bones of his Arms, Legs and Thighs were broken with an Iron Bar, and he afterwards received upwards of 20 Strokes on his Brea&s;t, before he expired. Andrews, the pre&s;ent Criminal was &s;oon after his Arrival ta|ken up, and impri&s;oned &s;ome Time at Bo&s;ton, when he attempted to cut his own Throat, but was pre|vented by the Care of his Attendants. From Bo&s;ton he was &s;ent here, where he arrived the Twenty-&s;ixth Day of May, 1766, and has remained a Pri&s;oner ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day la&s;t, the 17th In&s;tant, by Virtue of a &s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ion, he was tried by a Court of Admiralty held for that Purpo&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of his Excellency the Governor pre&s;ident, the Gentlemen of his Maje&s;ty's Council, the Judge of the Admiralty, the Commander of his Maje&s;ty's Ship Deal Ca&s;tle, the Deputy's Secretary, and the Receiver General and Collector of the Province.</P>
<P>Richard Nicholls, E&s;quire, Regi&s;ter of the Court of Vice-Admiralty, at New-York, and John M'Ke&s;|&s;on, E&s;q, Deputy Regi&s;ter of the &s;aid Court, and a Notary Public, in the &s;aid Province, exhibited five &s;everal Charges in the &s;aid Court, again&s;t him&mdash; During the Cour&s;e of the Trial, fourteen Witne&s;|&s;es were examined on the Part of the Crown, and two on the Part of the Pri&s;oner&mdash;The greate&s;t Part of the Clothing found with the Pri&s;oner in his Che&s;t, and by him claimed as his own, in the Pre&s;ence of the Court, were very fully and circum&s;tantially proved to have belonged to Captain Duryee, and his Mate, or &s;ome of the Per&s;ons who were murdered on board the &s;aid Sloop, and al&s;o many other Things found in the Che&s;t and owned by the Pri&s;oner, &mdash; Many of them were marked with the initial Letters of the Names of their former Owners, and many others of them with the plain Marks of tho&s;e initial Letters remaining, tho' the Silk of the marking was taken out, and they were marked J. A, the initial Letters of the Name of the Pri&s;oner.&mdash;Several Things &s;aid by the Pri&s;|oner, during the Cour&s;e of the Trial, and in his Defence, militated much again&s;t him.&mdash;&mdash; The Trial la&s;ted from Ten of the Clock on Wedne&s;|day, until One of the Clock on Thur&s;day Morning, during all which Time, his Excellency never left the Bench.&mdash;&mdash;The Evidence was full, clear and particular, and the Pri&s;oner found <HI>guilty,</HI></P>
<P>He is to be executed this Day, between the Hours of Ten in the Morning, and Two in the Af|ternoon, on the Strand, at the Ea&s;t Side of Hud&s;on's River, near Domini's Hook, between the ebbing and flowing of the Tide: And his Body to be afterwards hung in Chains, on the mo&s;t con&s;picuous Part of the Pe&s;t-I&s;land in New-York Bay, as a Spectacle to de|ter all Per&s;ons from the like Felonies for the fu|ture.</P>
<P>On Friday the &s;ame Court of Admiralty met for the Trial of Stephen Porter, Mariner, for the Murder of Capt. John We&s;tcot, and &s;undry others, on board a Bri&s;tol Ship on the High Seas on the Coa&s;t of Guinea, in the Year 1766,&mdash;But on the Officers going to bring him up from the Pri&s;on, they found him hanging to one of the Window Bars, quite dead, he having made U&s;e of a String he u&s;ually kept up his Irons with:&mdash;The Coroner's Inque&s;t brought it in Self-Murder, and he was &s;en|tenced to be buried in the High-Way, at the fur|ther End of the Bowry-Lane, and have a Stake drove through his Body.</P>
