<L>TOM TACLE was noble, was true to his word;</L>
<L>If merit brought titles, TOM might be my lord,</L>
<L>How gailey his bark through life's ocean would &s;ail,</L>
<L>Truth furni&s;h'd the rigging and honor the gale;</L>

<L>That as good as he was, made him all that was bad;</L>
<L>He was paltry, and pitiful, &s;curvy and mean,</L>

<L>For &s;o &s;aid the girls and the landlords long &s;hore,</L>

<L>'Twas once on a time when we took a gal|leon,</L>
<L>And the crew touched the agent for ca&s;h to &s;ome tune,</L>
<L>TOM took a trip to jail an old me&s;&s;mate to free,</L>
<L>And four thankful prattlers &s;oon &s;at on his knee;</L>
<L>Then TOM was an Angel from Heav'n down &s;ent,</L>
<L>While they had hands he his goodne&s;s &s;hould never repent:</L>
