<HEAD>EXPLANATORY PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the peru&s;al of &s;everal works on the prevention and cure of di&s;ea&s;e, I have &s;eldom met with any that, according to my conceptions, have been formed with &s;ufficient per&s;picuity; for though &s;implicity of &s;tile may be e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, con&s;ider|ing the cla&s;s of people to whom &s;uch labours are addre&s;&s;ed; &s;till I &s;ee no cau&s;e, why the very principles and rea&s;oning by which they ought to be directed in their pur&s;uit &s;hould either be totally omitted, or treated in &s;o &s;light a manner, as not to afford any material advantages&mdash;the principles I mean are, the NATURE OF CONSTITUTIONS, and THE IMMEDIATE CAUSES OF DIS|EASE; for whether we wi&s;h to prevent or cure, the&s;e two points mu&s;t ever be kept in view. To prove this, let us inquire, by what are we directed in our attempts to avoid di&s;ea&s;e?</P>
<P>From the knowledge of the remote cau&s;es, being well ac|quainted with the effect which they are calculated to produce in the machine, and preventing their acce&s;&s;ion; but in all ca&s;es this cannot be done; in many, prevention of that circum&s;tance is impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;how then mu&s;t we act? By &s;o regulating the pow|ers of the con&s;titution, that it may be placed in &s;uch a &s;tate as to be rendered incapable of feeling the effect of the remote cau&s;e.</P>
<P>And how can this be accompli&s;hed without being thoroughly acquainted with the nature of the con&s;titution it&s;elf; Indeed, it &s;eems not only nece&s;&s;ary in this re&s;pect, but al&s;o to render the di&s;ea&s;e, when the cau&s;e has produced its con&s;equence, as mild as po&s;&s;ible. Various proofs of the validity of this doctrine will ari&s;e upon &s;light con&s;ideration. In inoculating for the &s;mall-pox, we find very often great variability in the di&s;ea&s;e; and this can|not, it is clear, be owing to the matter by which the complaint is occa&s;ioned, having any variability of action; for the &s;ame matter taken from the very &s;ame pock will produce in different habits a di&s;ea&s;e of very different natures, with re&s;pect to mild|ne&s;s or malignancy&mdash;it is therefore obvious the variation mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;ome deviations in the &s;eparate habits, which require
<PB N="vi" REF="028021_0003_0FD627D0F4063108">
different modes of preparation;&mdash;and, probably, it is owing to want of accuracy in this point that &s;ome children after being in|oculated die, and &s;everal fall into other maladies.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the other principle to which we mu&s;t advert with regard to the cure; we &s;hould confine our&s;elves to the IM|MEDIATE CAUSE OR CAUSES, which, acting in the habit, produce tho&s;e &s;ymptoms, an enumeration of which is called di&s;ea&s;e; for all other cau&s;es in this point of view are of no avail. Matters it by what means the di&s;ea&s;e has been occa&s;ioned, &s;ince the ac|tion of that cau&s;e is pa&s;t? the effect at this time acting as a cau&s;e, claims only attention, for that conquered, the di&s;ea&s;e va|ni&s;hes. To explain, let us take the Drop&s;y,&mdash;its cau&s;es have been &s;aid to be, <Q>an hereditary di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;drinking &s;trong li|quors, want of exerci&s;e, exce&s;&s;ive evacuations&mdash;&s;udden &s;top|page of tho&s;e which are cu&s;tomary and nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;large quan|tities of cold, weak, watery liquors drank when the body has been over-heated by violent exerci&s;e&mdash;a low damp mar&s;hy &s;i|tuation&mdash;long u&s;e of poor watery diet, or vi&s;cous aliment that is hard of dige&s;tion. It is often the effect of other di&s;ea&s;es, as jaundice, &s;cirrhus of the liver, violent ague of long continu|ance, loo&s;ene&s;s, dy&s;entery, an empyema, or con&s;umption of the lungs&mdash;in &s;hort, whatever ob&s;tructs per&s;piration, or pre|vents the blood from being duly prepared, may occa&s;ion a drop&s;y.</Q> The&s;e <HI>may</HI> produce this malady, I do not deny, but that not one of them is the immediate cau&s;e again&s;t which our remedies are &s;olely to be levelled to perfom a cure, nor any number of them, except &s;uch of which drop&s;y is only a &s;ymp|tom. It is to the effect brought on by the&s;e cau&s;es that we are to attend, which I take to be <HI>general relaxation of the &s;olids&mdash;a thin watery blood&mdash;and a weakened action of the ab&s;orbents,</HI> (23.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Where the figures are put without the No, the&s;e refer to the Page<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> where with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> No, or &s;ucceeding it, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> throughout the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>) by which more water is thrown into the cellular &s;y&s;tem and differ|ent cavities by the exhalent, than can be taken up by the ab|&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>From the enumeration of the former, not any thing can be collected re&s;pecting the cure&mdash;but from the immediate cau&s;es every thing, as they plainly point out the indications, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to invigorate the &s;olids, and increa&s;e the action of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, that the water may be taken from the places wherein it is depo&s;ited, and thrown out of the machine.</P>
<P>It was the defect in the&s;e particulars that furni&s;hed one prin|cipal rea&s;on for pre&s;enting this work to the public, in order to &s;upply other information ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and more e&s;&s;en|tially beneficial. I have therefore been obliged to divide the
<PB N="vii" REF="028021_0004_0FD6700CB2693E30">
work into di&s;tinct heads&mdash;the fir&s;t of which comprehends the ANATOMY of tho&s;e parts in which re&s;ide the active powers of the con&s;titution chiefly, with intent to make my reader ac|quainted with the nature of them, their u&s;es, connections, and dependencies; that he might have &s;ome idea of the materials upon which he was to act; as well as be taught what he might expect from them: for to attempt to teach a man the mode of proceeding in any art, without informing him of the nature of the &s;ubject to which he is to direct his attention, would be like throwing a rough diamond to a gla&s;s-grinder, he might de&s;troy, but never poli&s;h. Suppo&s;e a man &s;eized with a pain in his bowels, attended with trifling evacuations, he &s;ees cordials are good in &s;ome of the&s;e ca&s;es, and &s;light opiates&mdash;he takes them, they give him relief for &s;ome time&mdash;they return more violent|ly, he has recour&s;e to the &s;ame remedies, 'till an inflammation comes on&mdash;con&s;idering the intervals of ea&s;e he has obtained, he has no conception how this can ari&s;e&mdash;let him be informed of the &s;tructure and nature of the bowels, he will &s;oon under&s;tand that they are &s;ubject to irritating cau&s;es, liable to inflammatory affections; and readily conceive why tho&s;e irritating cau&s;es mu&s;t be removed before cordials and opiates &s;hould be taken; which he could never do without &s;uch knowledge of the parts. Indeed, I believe for want of this many have fallen &s;acri|fices.</P>
<P>The parts being &s;hewn in their &s;imple &s;tate, I have next &s;poken of them collectively, &s;hewing the nature of different CONSTITUTIONS, which are formed by the combinations of the&s;e. I conceive this knowledge e&s;&s;ential nece&s;&s;ary towards the preventing of di&s;ea&s;e, palliating &s;uch as are incurable, and conquering tho&s;e which lie within the reach of our powers; for there are a variety which require particular att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ntion, in order that full effects may be given to our regimen, and medi|cal treatment; for, without the one is properly adapted to the other, we &s;hall not only be foiled in our attempts to cure; but the very means u&s;ed for pre&s;ervation from, will be in&s;trumental in bringing on di&s;ea&s;e, which too frequently proves mortal. This we need not here farther elucidate, as what we have &s;aid in the former part of the preface, and in the introduction, ren|der it unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Thus for the parts of the machine to be acted upon have been con&s;idered. It remains now to &s;peak of tho&s;e which are the agents, the NON-NATURALS, &s;o term'd, and MEDICINAL SUBSTANCES&mdash;the fir&s;t of which have called forth my atten|tion, in order to &s;hew the great influence they have on, and how by being properly managed, they contribute to keep the
<PB N="viii" REF="028021_0005_0FD627D26E2A7F28">
body in a &s;tate of health; for it is almo&s;t &s;olely on them that we mu&s;t depend for this purpo&s;e&mdash;for good air&mdash;proper ali|ment, moderate in quantity&mdash;&s;uitable exerci&s;e and re&s;t&mdash;with due &s;ubordination of mental affections, form the be&s;t plan for our bodily &s;ecurity&mdash;we have therefore endeavoured to &s;hew how they act under different circum&s;tances, and how nece&s;&s;ary it is to lay down rules with re&s;pect to them; which, by ob&s;er|ving, &s;upply the mo&s;t plea&s;ing con&s;equences&mdash;freedom from pain, vigour of mind, and a placid old age; and, by neglecting, the contrary extremes&mdash;be&s;ides, we have con&s;idered &s;ome of them with re&s;pect to their powers as medical &s;ub&s;tances, and &s;hewn how they act, as by the&s;e means we might afford an op|portunity of properly combining the two, that they might a&s;|&s;i&s;t in &s;trengthening, and not, by producing contrary effects, counteract each other.</P>
<P>As for medicines, there, perhaps, my reader may con&s;ider me too &s;y&s;tematical, as I have pre&s;erved the terms of the &s;chools, and rea&s;oned too ab&s;tractly, perhaps, according to his comprehen&s;ion. However, when it is known that I have given the derivation of every term, and explained the powers of each cla&s;s, as commonly conceived, in a manner to render them in this place ea&s;ily intelligible; for the terms them&s;elves, once un|der&s;tood, are infinitely more expre&s;&s;ive, and involve more ideas than any other which might be thought more familiar, I &s;hall, I hope, &s;tand excu&s;ed, as well as for dwelling upon the powers which medicines exert; for it appeared not only nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak of the good that was likely to accrue from this action, but al&s;o of the mi&s;chief which they might create, injudiciou&s;ly applied; therefore I was to exhibit them in different views, that it might be known where their exhibition was &s;afe, where uncertain, or perhaps detrimental&mdash;becau&s;e a medicine may be proper re&s;pecting a complaint to be relieved, but its mode of action injurious to the con&s;titution&mdash;for in&s;tance, co&s;tivene&s;s is to be removed, if it &s;hould be attended with heat and pain in the bowels, &s;hewing that in them there is a great irritation, and that the blood mu&s;t circulate too freely, the &s;timulant pur|gatives, are improper, (173.)&mdash;if there &s;hould be coldne&s;s in them, and the blood circulates uncommonly &s;low and languid the cooling, (171.) &s;hould not be u&s;ed&mdash;and if habitual co&s;tive|ne&s;s be an error of the habit, the a&s;tringent kind, (172.) &s;hould be avoided.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be taxed by &s;ome of my female readers with inhu|manity, if the ri&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of infants were forgotten, with whom many have &s;aid little is to be done. Take them from the indul|gence of fond parents; the vanity, ignorance, neglect, and &s;el|fi&s;hne&s;s

of conceited nur&s;es, I believe very little would be nece&s;|&s;ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; &s;ave where they, like adults, were liable to be affected with accidental complaints, and then properly nur&s;ed, they would be more readily cured. To the form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r I can only reply; my animadver&s;ion mu&s;t yield to "who can help it" I lament the misfortune of the infant, and pity the feelings of the parent, who&s;e partiality lays the foundation for ten thou&s;and heart-aches&mdash;and to the cu&s;toms of the latter, with all their train of poi&s;ons, I oppo&s;e the plain directions given under the article Nur&s;ing&mdash;to the peru&s;al of which I recommend all mothers, and ra|tional &s;uperintendants, and leave it to &s;peak for it&s;elf; it is un|complicated, founded upon facts deduced from ob&s;ervation and experience, and &s;upported by the voice of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The parts of which we have here &s;poken form what is nece&s;|&s;ary to be under&s;tood before any one &s;hould enter on the prac|tice of phy&s;ic, as without the&s;e the adventurers &s;ail upon the bo&s;om of a dangerous &s;ea, dive&s;ted of rudder and compa&s;s. It mu&s;t be &s;o clear to common ob&s;ervation, that I &s;hall con&s;ider it admitted; and proceed to clo&s;e with the account of the practi|cal part&mdash;and here I have laboured to be as &s;imple, and u&s;ual|ly conci&s;e, as the nature of &s;uch a work would admit.</P>
<P>After &s;hewing the tendency of the di&s;ea&s;e in general, I have particulari&s;ed the de&s;cription of each, that is, collected the &s;ymp|toms which have happened, forming its hi&s;tory; but as the whole of the&s;e do not always occur, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ill would burthen, from their number, the memory of tho&s;e who have &s;light knowledge, or are totally uninformed&mdash;out of tho&s;e I have &s;elected the charac|teri&s;tic &s;igns, by pointing out &s;uch &s;ymptoms as are agreed al|ways to attend, laying down before the remote or immediate cau&s;es: becau&s;e if it appears that the patient has been in the way of the former, it increa&s;es the probability of his being attacked by the latter, which give origin to the di&s;ea&s;e. In this there &s;eems to be a peculiar advantage, becau&s;e the immediate cau&s;e or cau&s;es being remembered, leads us fairly to account for a num|ber of the &s;ymptoms by which the patient may be oppre&s;&s;ed. This needs no exemplification, on comparing one with the other, it will appear obvious.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the medicinal &s;ub&s;tances, a catalogue is gi|ven of them cla&s;&s;ed under different heads, with the common do&s;es annexed, and al&s;o a variety of formulae&mdash;<HI>in the fir&s;t place,</HI> for the purpo&s;e of &s;upplying a number of materials po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;imilar powers, though in different degrees, under one head; that the pre&s;criber might have an opportunity of making his own elec|tion, and varying them as particular circum&s;tances might require; be&s;ides empowering him to pre&s;cribe in the mo&s;t &s;imple manner&mdash;<HI>in</HI>

<P>There are al&s;o, other advantages in this work, which will be to young &s;tudents of no little con&s;equence; for here they will be relieved in their inve&s;tigation of the real meaning of techni|cal terms, as they are either explained in the body of the work where they occur, and references made in the Index, or in the Index it&s;elf; and the various articles referred to different places will &s;hew them the different powers they po&s;&s;e&s;s, as well as the be&s;t modes of compo&s;ition&mdash;for in&s;tance&mdash;myrrh is referred to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. 164. 18<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.&mdash;by the&s;e it will be &s;hewn, that it is a &s;ti|mulant&mdash;expectorant&mdash;emenagogue&mdash;and anti&s;eptic, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the numbers following the letter F. will refer the reader to the different form, in which it is pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Such, then, my plan, &s;uch my rea&s;ons on which I ri&s;que its &s;upport. It is not for me to determine whether it is hap|pily conceived, or well executed.

<P>To give rational information to tho&s;e, who not being pro|perly educated, are obliged to practi&s;e from nece&s;&s;ity; de|claring, at the &s;ame time, my wi&s;h to &s;top the daring hand of incon&s;iderate ra&s;hne&s;s, bold from ignorance, and carele&s;s from contempt of &s;ocial duty.</P>
<P>To convince tho&s;e who are led by humanity, or whom in|&s;tinctive whim, too oft mi&s;taken for that virtue, prompts to vi|&s;it the mi&s;erable roofs of &s;ickly indigence, that &s;omething more is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute the medical pilot&mdash;to convince them, that in family recipes, and borrowed no&s;trums, there is little &s;ucce&s;s, and le&s;s &s;ecurity&mdash;that if &s;timulated by the de&s;ire of doing good, the materials to which they &s;hould be limited, lie within a narrow compa&s;s&mdash;warmth&mdash;decent cloathing, moderate living, indu&s;try, and cleanline&s;s.

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION. SECTION I.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<P>WHEN we reflect on the precariou&s;ne&s;s of man's exi&s;tence in this life, the multiplicity of dangers with which he is &s;urrounded, even from the fir&s;t moment of his being to his ultimate &s;tage; and al&s;o that the fabric of his machine is &s;o formed, that the means nece&s;&s;ary for its pre&s;ervation are &s;o ma|ny in&s;truments wearing out its powers and conducing to di&s;&s;olu|tion; and, at the &s;ame time, con&s;ider, that he is &s;ubject to an immen&s;e variety of di&s;ea&s;es, which often occa&s;ion him to drag out a life of pain and mi&s;ery; nay, frequently cut him off even in the bloom and vigour of his age: it will not appear extraor|dinary that many men of the fir&s;t, and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed abili|ties, have devoted them&s;elves, not only to the &s;tudy of Medi|cine, in order to cure tho&s;e maladies, by which man is con&s;tant|ly attacked; but al&s;o prevent their origin, or the mi&s;chiefs which are apt to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>From the time of GALEN, who has, upon this la&s;t &s;ubject, written mo&s;t elaborately, to the pre&s;ent day, we have had vari|ous publications, calculated to in&s;truct mankind in the Art of pre&s;erving Health, preventing Di&s;ea&s;es, or &s;hortening their Du|ration by the u&s;e of judicious applications: indeed, of late years, their particular documents have been &s;tudiou&s;ly conveyed in &s;uch a &s;tyle, as to be readily intelligible to common under&s;tand|ings; &s;o that each man might become, in &s;ome degree, his own Phy&s;ician. Such laudable undertakings merit the highe&s;t prai&s;e, and, if well conducted, promi&s;e the mo&s;t &s;alutary con&s;equences; for there can be no doubt but the modes of preventing Di&s;ea&s;es, &s;hortening their Duration, and warding off their evil tendencies by early a&s;&s;i&s;tance, are not only the ea&s;ie&s;t, but &s;afe&s;t, and mo&s;t plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>What has been written on this &s;ubject may to many, perhaps, appear &s;ufficient: and &s;o it probably might be, were all men's con|&s;titutions &s;imilar; for the methods advi&s;ed by many of tho&s;e authors, are &s;elected with great judgment, and extremely well calculated to an&s;wer the ends propo&s;ed, under the circum&s;tance above &s;pecified; but there &s;eems to be a very great defect in all
<PB N="18" REF="028021_0014_0FD66FE1F1D3D818">
the publications which have treated on the&s;e &s;ubjects&mdash;they give no information to their readers how the variations of con&s;titu|tions are to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, or in what ca&s;es the methods are properly to be altered; and without this the pre&s;cribing of re|medies can be con&s;idered little le&s;s than a &s;pecies of quackery, by whatever authority it may be &s;anctioned.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ality or generality of any medicine furni&s;hes the idea of the mo&s;t flagrant ab&s;urdity, &s;uitable only to the arrogance of every ignorant impo&s;tor; and certainly appropriating reme|dies of the &s;ame &s;pecific nature to one complaint in all con&s;ti|tutions, however di&s;&s;imilar, is, at lea&s;t, a branch of the &s;ame tree; for it is a fact uncontrovertible, &s;upported by the &s;ounde&s;t experience&mdash;that what may be of great &s;ervice to one con&s;titu|tion, may to another be highly detrimental, though labouring under the &s;ame affection.</P>
<P>To elucidate this, I &s;hall adduce a very familiar example&mdash;to many of my readers, perhaps, experimentally comprehen&s;ible; I mean the mode of obviating the effects of INEBRIATION.</P>
<P>Under this circum&s;tance we will &s;uppo&s;e a man of &s;trong &s;ta|mina&mdash;full habit of body&mdash;with good dige&s;tive powers, and a nervous &s;y&s;tem acting with firmne&s;s and regularity; and one, of a relaxed con&s;titution&mdash;not abounding with blood&mdash;a weak, delicate &s;tomach&mdash;and the nerves ea&s;ily irritated&mdash;</P>
<P>The advice to alleviate the con&s;titutional di&s;turbances occa&s;i|oned by this indi&s;cretion&mdash;is lying in bed, and promoting per|&s;piration by plentiful dilution, that is, drinking copiou&s;ly of weak tea&mdash;&s;mall broth&mdash;thin gruel&mdash;weak white wine or vinegar whey&mdash;or &s;ome &s;uch liquors warm, that the &s;uperabundance may be evacuated with which the patient has been loaded, and the body &s;oaked, <HI>us it is termed,</HI> into its &s;ober &s;tandard. For the robu&s;t man the advice might be proper&mdash;for by the &s;urcharge of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, and the &s;timulus of the intoxicating liquids, his habit becomes nearly to a&s;&s;ume an inflammatory di&s;|po&s;ition, di&s;covered by pain and a &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s of the head; redne&s;s of his eyes; quick &s;trong pul&s;e; much heat, and great thir&s;t&mdash;which are the general concomitants of &s;uch a debauch; and thus he requires ab&s;tinence, evacuation, re&s;t, and dilution for his alleviation. But the &s;ame mode, applied to the other, renders all his con&s;titutional defects wor&s;e, he experiences the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations of languor, &s;ickne&s;s, oppre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits, and un|de&s;cribable &s;inkings&mdash;all increa&s;ed by &s;uch a regimen; who&s;e good con&s;equences are derived in the former cure from relaxa|tion and debilitating the &s;y&s;tem. The delicate con&s;titutioned man requires fre&s;h air, riding on hor&s;eback, a gla&s;s or two of generous wine, or &s;ome cordial, &s;uch as will invigorate the pow|ers
<PB N="19" REF="028021_0015_0FD6701812A894B0">
of his habit, promote va&s;cular action, &s;trengthen his &s;tomach, increa&s;e in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, and thus conquer tho&s;e unhappy feelings he labours under from increa&s;ed weakne&s;s and debility. Simple as is this fact, and of little con&s;equence as it may be thought, the &s;ame peculiarities occur in di&s;ea&s;es of the mo&s;t alarming nature; and I am per&s;uaded that it is from ignorance or inattention in this point, that people are apt to increa&s;e their maladies, nay often make that, which would, left to it&s;elf, have been mild, become dangerous by applications not adapted to the particular nature of the con&s;titution. For as curing di&s;|ea&s;es depends on the knowledge of this particular, by which we can more certainly appropriate our remedies to the benefit of the afflicted, &s;o doubtle&s;s mu&s;t it be a more e&s;&s;ential point in pre&s;erving from, preventing, and &s;hortening their duration, as in all our endeavours we mu&s;t attempt to keep the con&s;titution in, or bring it to a &s;tate of health, con&s;i&s;tent with the principle of its formation, and the nature of the particular parts of which it is formed&mdash;and how can this be accompli&s;hed without the pecu|liarities of the con&s;titution are known to the per&s;on applying remedies, or fixing on any regimen?</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to attain this point, as the&s;e &s;heets are addre&s;&s;ed to the un-informed, it appears unavoidable to give &s;ome account of the human machine, with regard to the &s;truc|ture, dependencies and action of its parts, before we enter on the means to be u&s;ed in particular ca&s;es, that every man may be informed of the materials upon which his remedies and regimen are to operate; be able to di&s;cover their particular &s;tate, and hence proceed with &s;ome degree of regularity and certainty.</P>
<P>Now the human machine con&s;i&s;ts of SOLIDS and FLUIDS, differently di&s;po&s;ed, for the purpo&s;e of &s;upporting each other; &s;o that as the parts are worn away or de&s;troyed by the nece&s;&s;ary actions of life, they may be again &s;upplied; and this diminu|tion and acce&s;&s;ion pre&s;erves a con&s;tant routine, until the animal agreeable to the laws of nature, is de&s;troyed by its own exer|tions, the machine being rendered incapable of continuing its vital actions: thus, without any preternatural cau&s;e, gradually de&s;cends to the grave.</P>
<P>But in order to promote the different purpo&s;es allotted to the &s;olids and fluids for the well-being of the human body, they are variou&s;ly divided.</P>
<P>The SOLIDS into bones, cartilages or gri&s;tles, ligaments, mu&s;cles with their tendons, nerves, ve&s;&s;els, glands, and mem|branes.</P>
<P>The FLUIDS, into blood, nervous fluid; per&s;pirable matter flowing through the &s;kin in&s;en&s;ibly, or in form of &s;weat; &s;aliva
<PB N="20" REF="028021_0016_0FD66FE3A0DEEAC0">
&s;eparated by the glands of the mouth and throat; ear-wax; mu|cus; ga&s;tric and inte&s;tinal juices, liquids &s;ecreted into the &s;to|mach and bowels; cy&s;tic and hepatic biles, &s;eparated by the li|ver, lodged in part in the gall bladder, in part emptied into the fir&s;t bowel called duodenum; pancreatic juice, or that of the &s;weet bread: urine, &s;emen, liquor of the pro&s;trate gland, and that fluid which moi&s;tens the internal &s;urface of all cavities; the glary mucilaginous liquid of the joints called &s;ynovia; tears; mucus of the no&s;trils; a white nutritious fluid &s;eparated from the food in the inte&s;tines, called chyle, lymph, fat, and mar|row.</P>
<P>It will not be nece&s;&s;ary to give prolix accounts of the differ|ent component parts of the human machine; but only &s;uch as may enable our readers &s;o far to under&s;tand the anatomy, as to furni&s;h ideas &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in pur&s;uing the future &s;ub|ject with &s;ome requi&s;ite degree of accuracy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the BONES, CARTILAGES, and other component Parts of the Body.</HEAD>
<P>THE BONES are the harde&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;olid parts of the human machine, calculated to &s;upport tho&s;e which are &s;oft and le&s;s firm, in all their motions and pre&s;&s;ures; they are cover|ed with a membrane, or thin bladdery &s;ub&s;tance, called perio&s;te|um, on account of its covering the bone, which is exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible, being plentifully &s;upplied with nerves and blood ve&s;&s;els. The out&s;ides of bones are commonly more compact than the in|ner parts; and are formed of plates, joined together by tran&s;ver&s;e fibres; their in&s;ides are &s;pongy and cellular, in which is con|tained marrow, within membranous bags, filling up the cells; this marrow, being more or le&s;s di&s;tributed over all the bones, and tran&s;uding through their plates and fibres, makes them tougher, and le&s;s brittle; the bones are &s;upplied both within and without, with blood ve&s;&s;els and nerves.</P>
<P>CARTILAGES or GRISTLES, are &s;olid, &s;mooth, white, ela&s;tic &s;ub&s;tances, between the hardne&s;s of a bone and that of a ligament, (<HI>&s;ee ligament below</HI>) covered with a membrane called perichondrium, becau&s;e it covers a cartilage, which is akin to the perio&s;teum of the bones; they &s;erve to make the bones, who&s;e extremities or ends they cover, move freely in the joints: they limit the growth of bones, as to their length, by hindering the bony fibres from &s;prouting out; and, therefore, when the cartilages in the joints are eroded, an immobility is there form|ed, called anchylo&s;is, or &s;tiff joint, by the elongation and coali|tion of the fibres of the bones that are articulated together; &s;ometimes they &s;erve as ligaments to join the bones together, and &s;ometimes they do the office of bones to greater advantage than the&s;e would do; as the cartilages of the ribs, which, by their ela&s;ticity chiefly contribute towards expiration; the carti|lages that make out brims of cavities, &amp;c.</P>
<P>LIGAMENTS are white, tough, flexible bodies, thicker and firmer than membranes, and not &s;o hard or &s;olid as cartilages, without cavity; difficulty &s;tretched and with little ela&s;ticity; they &s;erve to connect parts together, and keep the part to which they are fixed in a proper &s;ituation, as appears remarkably in the joints or articulations; they are made up of fibrous layers or &s;trata; the large&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t of which run lengthwi&s;e.</P>
<P>MUSCLE.&mdash;This is the name of the immediate organical in|&s;trument of motion in the animal body, whether voluntary or
<PB N="22" REF="028021_0018_0FD66FECAB8772A8">
involuntary; it is called organical, becau&s;e mere ela&s;ticity is the immediate cau&s;e of &s;ome motions, as in expiration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The arteries have been &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to contract them&s;elves after di&s;ten&s;ion by this ela&s;tic power; though they may in &s;ome degree, yet not totally, for they certainly, and I believe it is generally allowed, act by the contractile power of their mu&s;cular coat, as may be in&s;tanced in blu&s;hing&mdash;and their &s;udden increa&s;e of action from other local irritat.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The general characteri&s;tic of a mu&s;cle is, to con&s;i&s;t of fle&s;hy fibres which, when acting, contract them&s;elves, and become &s;horter; this contraction, according to different circum&s;tances of the mu&s;cle, and the parts to which it is fa&s;tened, produces differ|ent effects, and different motions.</P>
<P>If one end of a mu&s;cle is tied to a fixed part, and the other to a moveable one, when it acts, its fibres contracting will pull the moveable part to that which is fixed.</P>
<P>If both the parts, to which the extremities of a mu&s;cle are at|tached, be moveable, by its action, they will be both drawn to|wards each other.</P>
<P>If the mu&s;cle be hollow, and contain a fluid, when it contracts, it will pre&s;s upon, and endeavour to expel its contents; &s;uch a mu&s;cle as the heart, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure the &s;tomach, and uri|nary bladder.</P>
<P>If the fibres of a mu&s;cle return upon them&s;elves, in the form of a ring, when they contract, they will dimini&s;h the area within that circumference, making the circle narrower. Such mu&s;cles are employed to &s;hut cavities, and are called &s;phincters, becau&s;e they have the power of clo&s;ing cavities and re&s;training the exit of any thing they contain.</P>
<P>TENDONS.&mdash;The&s;e are continuations of fle&s;hy, mu&s;cular fibres; each tendon being divi&s;ible into as many fibres, or rather bundles of fibres, as the mu&s;cle it&s;elf is to which it belongs; but the tendinous fibres are more compacted and &s;maller, drier and harder, than the fle&s;hy fibres; they are not capable of contraction, but &s;erve like ropes to pull, when the fle&s;hy fibres act, for the commodiou&s;ne&s;s and firmne&s;s of in&s;ertion, and for the direction of motion.</P>
<P>NERVES.&mdash;The&s;e are &s;oft white cords, proceeding either from the brain or &s;pinal marrow, and running to every minute part of the body, and are the immediate in&s;truments of &s;en&s;ation, and indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for the continuance of mu&s;cular mo|tion. They are &s;uppo&s;ed by many to contain a very &s;ubtile fluid, but appear without any cavity di&s;cernible even by the fine&s;t micro&s;cope.</P>
<P>VESSELS in the machine mean the animal tubes or canals
<PB N="23" REF="028021_0019_0FD6701E1D2C6DF8">
through which fluids or juices move; the lea&s;t imaginable ve&s;&s;el is made of the lea&s;t membrane, rolled up in the form of a hol|low cylinder, or part of a cone. The ve&s;&s;els, as their coats mu&s;t be thicker, are compo&s;ed of thicker membranes, upon which &s;maller ve&s;&s;els run.</P>
<P>The&s;e are divided into ARTERIES, VEINS, ABSORBENTS, SE|CRETORY ve&s;&s;els, and EXCRETORY ducts.</P>
<P>ARTERY.&mdash;This is the name of that kind of ve&s;&s;el which, ari&s;ing originally from the heart, contains a fluid who&s;e motion is directed from thence towards the extremities and &s;urface of the body. The larger and ea&s;ily vi&s;ible arteries contain red blood, are of a conical figure&mdash;flew, tapering from the heart for|wards, and ramifying variou&s;ly; in living animals they be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> or have what is called a pul&s;e, an&s;wering to the motion of the heart; their coats look whiti&s;h, and are pretty thick and &s;trong.</P>
<P>VEINS.&mdash;The&s;e contain a fluid who&s;e motion is from the extremities or &s;urface of the body towards the heart; their coats are thinner and more tran&s;parent than tho&s;e of the arteries, and, therefore, they appear of a blui&s;h, livid colour, the blood &s;hining through them. In many places they have valves within them, which open towards the heart, and &s;hut the contrary way.</P>
<P>ABSORBENT VESSELS.&mdash;So called, becau&s;e they ab&s;orb or take up fluids, and are divided into LYMPHATICS and LACTEALS, from the particular liquids they convey to other parts&mdash;they are &s;imilar, only have different origins, and calculated for different purpo&s;es, from whence they take their names, the former convey the lymph or aqueous fluids, the latter the milky juice, formed from the aliment in the inte&s;tines called chyle; the lymphatics are the general ab&s;orbents, and carry the juices to what is called the receptaculum chyli, thoracic duct, and left &s;ubclavian vein; the lacteals to the receptaculum chyli, or receptacle of the chyle.</P>
<P>The <HI>lymphatics</HI> and <HI>lacteals</HI> are very fine ve&s;&s;els; the former of which ari&s;e from the &s;urface of the body, and all cavities or cells of the cellular membrane; the &s;urface of the inte&s;tines, of the urine and gall bladders, of the ventricles of the brain, and of all other parts, and carry a pelucid liquor towards the recepta|culum chyli, and the thoracic duct, in which, like the lacteals, do they all terminate.</P>
<P>SECRETORY VESSELS.&mdash;The&s;e are all tho&s;e tubuli or mi|nute tubes, in the different organs, which are adapted for the purpo&s;es of &s;ecretion, pre&s;umed to &s;eparate and &s;train off the dif|ferent humours from the general ma&s;s of fluids.</P>
<P>EXCRETORY VESSELS are tho&s;e tubes or ducts which al&s;o belong to the different organs of &s;en&s;ation; who&s;e office is to
<PB N="24" REF="028021_0020_0FD66FEEB90D3980">
carry off the humours that are &s;eparated, and either convey them to their appropriated receptacles, where &s;ome of them are depo|&s;ited, or di&s;charge them out of the body.</P>
<P>GLAND denotes in general an organical texture, of a circum|&s;cribed figure, framed &s;o as to &s;eparate from the blood, a liquid, different from, and unlike the blood; of the&s;e are various kinds, &s;ome more &s;imple, others more complex or compounded and are called by the common people, kernel.</P>
<P>MEMBRANE.&mdash;This is a web or rather a lamina, or &s;lough formed of a very thin &s;ub&s;tance, appearing like a bladder, who&s;e thickne&s;s bears a very &s;mall proportion to its breadth and length. Mo&s;t, if not all the membranes, we &s;ee in the animal body, are compo&s;ed of; and re&s;olvable into thinner ones.</P>
<P>FIBRE is a &s;mall thread or filament, without a cavity, at lea&s;t without one vi&s;ible; who&s;e breadth and thickne&s;s bears a very &s;mall proportion to its length; the lea&s;t fibre of all is too minute to be perceived by our &s;en&s;es, however a&s;&s;i&s;ted. The fibres we can perceive, are no other than &s;o many bundles of &s;maller ones tied together.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e are the different &s;olids of the human machine &s;im|ply con&s;idered, and being differently di&s;po&s;ed and united, by means of the cellular membrane, of which we &s;hall &s;oon &s;peak, form the human body. This is divided into the LIVING SOLIDS, called <HI>&s;olida viva,</HI> and into the INERT SOLIDS, called <HI>&s;olida in|ertia,</HI> which con&s;titute the hard parts, and help to complete the cellular &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The&s;e are again divided by phy&s;iologi&s;ts, or tho&s;e who treat of the human body and teach the u&s;es of its various parts, into three &s;y&s;tems. The VASCULAR SYSTEM&mdash;the NERVOUS SYS|TEM&mdash;and the CELLULAR SYSTEM.</P>
<P>The FIRST of the&s;e has the heart for its center; that is to &s;ay, all the tubes or canals which are comprehended in this divi|&s;ion, either carry fluids out from the heart, or return and convey them to it, and comprehend every &s;pecies of <HI>artery, vein, &s;inus, duct,</HI> and <HI>ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;el,</HI> and may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into <HI>circula|tory ve&s;&s;els, excretory ve&s;&s;els</HI> and <HI>ab&s;orbents;</HI> ve&s;&s;els, through which the blood circulates, by which particular fluids are &s;epa|rated from it, by which the&s;e la&s;t are carried from the place where &s;eparated, and by which fluids are taken up, and carried into the machine.</P>
<P>The CIRCULATORY VESSELS include all the arteries, which &s;pringing from the <HI>aorta</HI> or large artery of the heart, and that called pulmonary, &s;upplying the lungs, carry out the gene|ral ma&s;s of blood, and all the veins, which being reflected back,
<PB N="25" REF="028021_0021_0FD6701B1EDC6018">
and uniting at the two great &s;inu&s;es of the heart, return it, and thus maintain perpetual circulation.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;ecretory, excretory ve&s;&s;els,</HI> and <HI>ab&s;orbents,</HI> we have before explained.</P>
<P>The SECOND or NERVOUS SYSTEM, has the brain as its ba&s;is, from whence i&s;&s;ue different portions called medulla oblon|gata, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pinalis, and nerves. Some affirm that there are two &s;ets of nerves&mdash;the one adapted principally for the purpo&s;e of per|ception and &s;en&s;ation, be&s;towed on the &s;everal organs of &s;en&s;e, internal and external; while the other is blended with the mu&s;|cular fibres, becau&s;e it is ob&s;ervable in certain di&s;ea&s;es, that the mu&s;cular &s;trength &s;hall be totally exhau&s;ted, and yet the powers of perception and &s;en&s;ation remain entire; and on the other hand that the mu&s;cles &s;hall &s;ometimes exert prodigious &s;trength, while the &s;en&s;es are all locked up, hence the authority on which is founded the di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that though all animal motion &s;eems to be derived from the nervous &s;y&s;tem, and although the heart, like every other mu&s;cle, can act no longer than the communica|tion through the nerves which are be&s;towed on it, remains free; yet there is a nece&s;&s;ity for di&s;tingui&s;hing between the va&s;cular and nervous &s;y&s;tems; becau&s;e it will appear, when we come to inquire into the nature of di&s;ea&s;es, that there may be evident di&s;order in the one, while little or none &s;hall appear in the other; and this con&s;ideration will greatly influence us in the directions nece&s;&s;ary to be given for procuring relief. THESE <HI>form the liv|ing &s;olids.</HI></P>
<P>The INERT SOLIDS, not only con&s;titute &s;uch parts of the body as have neither nerves nor ve&s;&s;els; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the cuticle and its continuations; the nails; the hair; great &s;hare of the &s;ub|&s;tance of bones; cartilages; ligaments; tendons and their membranes: but the&s;e inert &s;olids form the connecting medium every where between the living &s;olids, binding together every minute ve&s;&s;el and nervous filament; and there are innumerable nerves and ve&s;&s;els in all parts of the body, except tho&s;e above mentioned, which no eye can trace; yet, if we rea&s;on from ana|logy, and &s;ay, that the &s;malle&s;t branches and filaments are like the vi&s;ible trunks and cords, then the tran&s;ver&s;e &s;ection of the&s;e mu&s;t be circular; and con&s;equently when they come to be in|terwoven or laid together, they mu&s;t univer&s;ally leave interme|diate pores, and minute cavities; hence we may under&s;tand, that though there may be &s;ome parts of the body, which have nei|ther nerves nor ve&s;&s;els, i. e. <HI>no living &s;olids,</HI> yet there is no place in the whole fabric to which the cellular &s;y&s;tem does not extend, and where there is not &s;ome picture of inert &s;olids; be&s;ides u|niting

and binding together the different &s;pecies of ve&s;&s;els, which either ri&s;e from or terminate at the heart; and all the nervous cords or filaments, which &s;pring from the brain or &s;pinal marrow, however variou&s;ly they may be combined, di&s;po&s;ed, or interwo|ven; and this fibrous and laminated connecting &s;ub&s;tance is not endowed, like the living &s;olids, with either &s;en&s;e of feeling or power of motion.</P>
<P>That the CELLULAR SYSTEM extends it&s;elf univer&s;ally throughout the whole frame, and has a general and free commu|nication, &s;eems fully proved by &s;ome particular di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uch as univer&s;al drop&s;y, called ana&s;arca; where water diffu&s;es it&s;elf through the whole body; or emphy&s;ema, where air occupies the &s;ame &s;pace, pa&s;&s;ing from pore to pore, and cell to cell; for this membrane con&s;i&s;ts of a number of little cells, hence its name, which in many parts communicate with each other.</P>
<P>In the natural and healthy &s;tate, the cavities of the cellular &s;y&s;tem, are either filled with a thin fine fluid called lymph, or with oil&mdash;hence it is di&s;tingui&s;hed into two parts, the lymphatic and adipo&s;e, according to the &s;ub&s;tances it contains.</P>
<P>The pores, or minute cavities of the lymphatic part, are al|ways to be under&s;tood as interpo&s;ed between every nervous fibril; whereas the adipo&s;e cells are not &s;o univer&s;ally extended, the fat or animal oil being always lodged in di&s;tinct bags or ve&s;icles, el&s;e, was it &s;uffered to diffu&s;e it&s;elf as freely through the cellular &s;y|&s;tem at large, it would be equally di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and fatal with the &s;preading of water in an univer&s;al drop&s;y, or of ela&s;tic air in an emphy&s;ema.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the BRAIN, and the other more complex Parts of the Machine.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now &s;hewn the &s;olid principles, and the &s;y&s;tems of which the human body, aggregately con&s;idered, con|&s;i&s;ts, we &s;hall take a view of &s;ome parts which are formed out of the&s;e, with their fluids and u&s;es, and give &s;uch accounts as may be requi&s;ite for the proper information of our readers, to enable them to di&s;cover what parts are affected in particular di&s;ea&s;es, and di&s;tingui&s;h their nature. We therefore begin with the BRAIN, which is a &s;oft pulpy &s;ub&s;tance, &s;urrounded by two membranes, one called <HI>dura,</HI> the other the <HI>pia mater</HI>&mdash;and has al&s;o a third called <HI>arachnoid,</HI> from its finene&s;s, &s;imilar to a &s;pider's web&mdash;the chief

peculiarities to be taken notice of for our purpo&s;es are the SI|NUSES, which are nothing more than large veins or receptacles for blood, and the VENTRICLES. Like other parts of the bo|dy it has a variety of arterial branches coming from the heart, which are diffu&s;ed through its &s;ub&s;tance, and on the membranes&mdash;from this is derived the whole nerves of the human machine, as the &s;pinal marrow is no more than a continuation of the brain through the vertebrae of the back&mdash;and this is con&s;idered the &s;ource of all perception, &s;en&s;ation, and &s;upport of mu&s;cular mo|tion.&mdash;It is not con&s;idered in it&s;elf very &s;en&s;ible, but can tran&s;|mit mo&s;t acute &s;en&s;ations to every part of the body by means of the nerves, when in a &s;tate of health&mdash;and mo&s;t violent ones when di&s;ea&s;ed; there is not the &s;malle&s;t portion of the living &s;olids but is materially connected with it&mdash;&s;o that it not only gives &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions to, but feels &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion from the &s;malle&s;t por|tions when affected; and it may be con&s;idered the fountain of all nervous incitability, by which all the parts dependent upon the nerves are put into motion, or continued capable of per&s;evering in their action.</P>
<P>And here, as we &s;hall often have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of NER|VOUS INCITABILITY, and MUSCULAR IRRITABILI|TY, two powers to which we allow the exi&s;tence of the machine, in a living &s;tate, and the action of all its moving &s;olids with re|&s;pect to their continuance, are entirely owing, it will be proper to de&s;cribe what we mean by the&s;e two terms; becau&s;e they cer|tainly do in &s;ome degree exi&s;t independent of each other, not|with&s;tanding their intimate union, and in general conjunct action&mdash;and al&s;o, as by this knowledge, we &s;hall in &s;ome ca&s;es be able to di&s;cover, how from particular defect in the&s;e two powers, &s;e|parately attended to, di&s;ea&s;es put on different appearances&mdash;and are to be prevented, alleviated, or cured by our applications made to them di&s;tinctively as well as unitedly.</P>
<P>By INCITABILITY we mean that power in the brain and nervous &s;y&s;tem, which may be put into action by mental affec|tion, as well as local irritation, and which produces tho&s;e appear|ances we call &s;ympathetic.</P>
<P>By IRRITABILITY we mean that power which may be put into action by material &s;timulus locally exerted&mdash;yet is obe|dient to the influence of the nerves in general&mdash;and cannot, in the living machine, exi&s;t for any con&s;iderable time without this union.</P>
<P>To elucidate this, we &s;hall ob&s;erve that many will be thrown into convul&s;ions by unea&s;ine&s;s of mind&mdash;we al&s;o know that the &s;ame complaint will be occa&s;ioned by &s;evere irritation on &s;ome part or parts of the machine; or that parts them&s;elves only will,
<PB N="28" REF="028021_0024_0FD66FF22E30FF38">
from this &s;ource, experience &s;uch effects&mdash;as in cramps. Now as we are totally ignorant how the mind acts upon the brain, and nervous &s;y&s;tem&mdash;how the&s;e act upon the mu&s;cular fibres&mdash;nor can we conceive how immateriality, which we take the thinking faculty to be, can act upon materiality, we can by no means make u&s;e of a term which points out &s;pecifically the action of the&s;e cau&s;es productive of morbid effects.</P>
<P>In order then either to prevent, alleviate, or cure the complaint from thence ari&s;ing, we pre&s;cribe &s;uch things as may amu&s;e the mind, and keep it free from tho&s;e painful reflections&mdash;and put the body into &s;uch a &s;tate as to render it le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of im|pre&s;&s;ions from this &s;ource.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we advert to the part or parts affected, and by our applications locally directed endeavour to remove the irritative cau&s;e in order to promote a cure&mdash;and with intent to prevent a return, do &s;uch things as to render the part or parts incapable of being affected by the cau&s;e, or put under &s;uch circum&s;tances as to render the acce&s;&s;ion of that cau&s;e impracticable&mdash;hence we think the di&s;crimination between the two terms ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary&mdash;as we &s;hall in advi&s;ing remedies always pay the &s;tricte&s;t attention to con&s;titutional peculiarities.</P>
<P>The LUNGS are &s;ituated in the che&s;t, and there divided into two large portions called LOBES, the one on the right, and the other on the left &s;ide, which are &s;eparated from one another by a tran&s;ver&s;e membrane called media&s;tinum&mdash;dividing the che&s;t into two equal &s;eparate cavities, that have no communication with one another: but the left lobe of the lungs is con&s;iderably le&s;s than the right, becau&s;e the heart with its membrane, called pe|ricardium, from its &s;urrounding the heart, with the great ve&s;&s;els that open into it, are contained in the left divi&s;ion.&mdash;The lungs, be&s;ides their external membrane, and cellular texture of which they are compo&s;ed, are a congeries of air ve&s;&s;els from the wind|pipe, which is a firm tube, made up of cartilaginous or gri&s;tly rings, joined together by mu&s;cular fibres&mdash;the&s;e rings backwards are incomplete; this de&s;cends into the brea&s;t almo&s;t to the ba&s;is of the heart, and there divides into two great branches, the one right, and the other left; which again are divided and &s;ubdivid|ed into le&s;&s;er and le&s;&s;er ramifications&mdash;and &s;o di&s;tributed through all the &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs, terminating at length in &s;mall mem|branous, dilatable cells, or ve&s;icles&mdash;as well as the&s;e, there are ve&s;&s;els which carry blood, and juices derived from the blood; and the&s;e two kind of canals are &s;o uniformly di&s;per&s;ed through the lungs, that in every phy&s;ical point there are branches all over, be&s;ides the&s;e they are &s;upplied with nerves and ab&s;orbents. Various are the u&s;es of this organ.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="028021_0025_0FD6701F8669B558">
The mo&s;t important is that of <HI>re&s;piration,</HI> by which a trajec|tion of blood is effected through their &s;ub&s;tance, and circulation completed, in which life con&s;i&s;ts; by comminuting, conden&s;ing, and rounding its particles, and thereby adapting them to flow through the canals of different &s;izes in the body; creating red|ne&s;s in its globules&mdash;be&s;ides it has &s;everal u&s;es which are of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to the animal, for by this means the abdo|minal vi&s;cera are with a continuance alternately pre&s;&s;ed upon, and freed from that compre&s;&s;ion; by which means concoction in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines is promoted; and the circulation through the &s;y&s;tem of the vena portarum, or large vein of the liver, which otherwi&s;e would be too &s;luggi&s;h, is urged on. The faeces and urine are expelled by its efforts; &s;melling is perform|ed by in&s;piring, or &s;nuffing up air; the foetus is excluded by its a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and &s;uction, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the new-born animal, is performed, and without it there could be no &s;uch thing as voice or &s;peech brought about. Be&s;ides, the lungs are con&s;idered as the recipient of animal heat, that is, the quantity of atmo&s;pheric air which ru&s;hes into the lungs at every in&s;piration being loaded with tho&s;e particles creating heat, they are &s;eparated from the air and pa&s;s into the blood, and by their evolution through the cour&s;e of circulation form an univer&s;al &s;ti|mulus to the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem&mdash;and at the &s;ame time they perform the office of excretion, throwing out &s;uch matters which have become u&s;ele&s;s, and would be hurtful if continued in the habit.</P>
<P>In the middle of the che&s;t between the two lobes of the lungs, rather inclining in its po&s;ition to the left &s;ide, lies the HEART. It is a &s;trong hollow mu&s;cle, having two cavities, &s;eparated by a &s;eptum or divi&s;ion, which are called ventricles, out of which i&s;&s;ue the two large arteries of the human machine&mdash;one called pulmonary artery, becau&s;e it &s;erves the lungs; the other aorta, or large artery of the body; near the mouths of the&s;e two ven|tricles are two other hollow mu&s;cular &s;ub&s;tances, from their &s;imi|litude to dogs ears, called auriculae, into which the ve&s;&s;els call|ed vena cava de&s;cendens, and a&s;cendens, and pulmonary veins open&mdash;the two former into the right, the latter into the left. It is al&s;o enveloped with a membrane from its &s;ituation, &s;urround|ing the heart, called pericardium, by which, and the large ve&s;|&s;els, it is kept in a fixed po&s;ition, within this membrane there is a &s;mall portion of a &s;erous fluid.</P>
<P>As we have con&s;idered the brain to be the &s;ource of all <HI>incita|bility,</HI> &s;o do we the heart one at lea&s;t, and that the principal &s;ource of <HI>irritability,</HI> who&s;e chief office is to promote the circu|lation of the blood, an account of which may not in this place be improper.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="028021_0026_0FD66FF35CC78DC0">
But before we enter on that &s;ubject, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that all the arteries of the machine ramify from the aorta, as branches of a tree from its trunk, dividing them&s;elves into minute ramifica|tions, in which there are no valves, except at the origin; whil&s;t the veins mu&s;t be looked upon as branches forming a large trunk, in which there are valves in&s;erted, which open to the heart. Now in the former of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els there is required no &s;uch contrivance, becau&s;e the blood, having a quick progre&s;&s;ive motion from the contractile power of the heart and arteries, has a &s;ufficient force impelling it from behind, which prevents its re|troce&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t, on the other hand the &s;low motion of the blood in the veins and their weaker contractile power, una&s;&s;i&s;ted with a force adequate to that of the heart, have great need of &s;uch an invention to prevent its regurgitation, and &s;ecure its re|turn to the heart.</P>
<P>Now for a moment let us &s;uppo&s;e the heart full of blood, that is, the ventricles have cea&s;ed to beat, and that it is put into mo|tion by &s;ome cau&s;e, what will be the re&s;ult with regard to the cir|culation? The le&s;&s;er circulation through the lungs will be per|formed in the following manner; the blood will be propelled into the pulmonary artery from the right ventricle, pa&s;s through the lungs, and return to the left auricle by the pulmonary vein; in the &s;ame manner in the greater circulation it will al&s;o be forced into the aorta, diffu&s;ed through the re&s;t of the machine, and re|turn to the right auricle by the vena cava, pa&s;&s;ing through the different glands, in order for them to &s;ecrete &s;uch fluids as they are de&s;tined for; whil&s;t, at the &s;ame time, the capillary or hair like tubes, where there is no &s;uch glandular contrivance, will pa&s;s off the matter of per&s;piration, the auricles then being filled with blood will contract; eject their contents into each ven|tricle, and the &s;ame routine be performed again as above de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The particular organs which we have now mentioned mu&s;t be looked upon as the three mo&s;t material ones for the &s;upport, and pre&s;ervation of life, and the &s;ources and in&s;truments of <HI>incitabi|lity,</HI> and <HI>irritability,</HI> by which they perform their actions, and on which all the moving powers of the machine depend; but into the account we mu&s;t al&s;o take the blood, which, with the lungs, we con&s;ider as the recipient and diffu&s;er of that fluid, or tho&s;e particles which animate nature, and &s;upply an univer&s;al &s;timulus, which occa&s;ions the action of the&s;e &s;ources and in&s;tru|ments of vital motion.</P>

when out of the body, and left to it&s;elf, divi&s;ible into three di&s;|tinct &s;ub&s;tances&mdash;<HI>&s;erum, gluten,</HI> and <HI>red globules,</HI> by a very &s;im|ple proce&s;s; though untouched, appearing only as two, called <HI>&s;erum</HI> and <HI>cra&s;&s;amentum,</HI> the latter floating in the former; but the cra&s;&s;amentum is of different degrees of firmne&s;s in different &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The SERUM in an healthy &s;tate is almo&s;t colourle&s;s; at other times, it is yellowi&s;h, or perhaps of a greeni&s;h hue, while the top of the cra&s;&s;amentum has different degrees of firmne&s;s, and puts on different appearances with re&s;pect to colour, according to the age, &s;ex, and &s;tate of health of the &s;ubject from whence it is taken. The &s;erum of the blood, like the white <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> egg, coagulates when highly rectified &s;pirit of wine, called alchohol, or any of the mineral acids, are mixed with it, or wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eated to about 160th degree of Farenheit's thermometer; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> other|wi&s;e it continues in a liquid &s;tate.</P>
<P>The CRASSAMENTUM is compo&s;ed of a peculiar &s;ub|&s;tance, which gives redne&s;s to the blood, and of, what phy&s;iolo|gi&s;ts term, coagulable lymph, from its coagulating &s;pontaneou&s;ly: This coagulable lymph may be &s;eparated from the red part in two ways; either by &s;tirring the blood which is fre&s;h drawn, with a whi&s;k, when the lymph coagulating in a &s;hort time, will adhere to the twigs, and appear like a firm membrane of a whit|i&s;h colour, compo&s;ed of fibres interwoven with each other; or by placing a piece of cra&s;&s;amentum on a &s;trainer, and pouring on water repeatedly, until the red particles being wa&s;hed away &s;hall leave only the whiti&s;h &s;ub&s;tance behind.</P>
<P>With regard to the red globules, it is not perfectly agreed of what nature they are; but it is a&s;&s;erted that the red colour is owing to a mixture of &s;ome portion of ferruginous or iron mat|ter; in confirmation of which it may be ob&s;erved, that the blood always becomes florid after a cour&s;e of medicines of that nature; but whether it ari&s;es chiefly from the addition of ferruginous matter, or owing to the increa&s;ed motion which the&s;e medicines always produce, will admit of &s;ome di&s;pute, for it is always found that the blood grows more red, in proportion to the action and the &s;trength of the ve&s;&s;els, and the&s;e medicines are allowed to produce &s;uch effects.</P>
<P>The proportion of the red part is &s;mall in re&s;pect to the o|ther con&s;tituent parts, for one grain weight of this colouring matter, will tinge, in a perceptible degree, a thou&s;and of pure water.</P>
<P>Now as the blood in its healthful &s;tate is a tenacious fluid, capable of receiving a greater portion of heating particles in proportion to its tenacity, as it pa&s;&s;es through the lungs, &s;o ac|cording
<PB N="32" REF="028021_0028_0FD627CF6836A1C8">
to its &s;tronger or weaker tenacity, will it be capable of retaining more or le&s;s of the&s;e &s;timulating particles, thus from this cau&s;e, will it be more or le&s;s &s;timulant, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in produc|ing different deviations in the con&s;titution, be&s;ides it is from dif|ferent cau&s;es liable to undergo many alterations; hence al&s;o will other differences be formed, of which we &s;hall take notice in the &s;ucceeding pages.</P>
<P>Indeed we might give &s;ome general practical ideas re&s;pecting this point; but as many peculiarities ari&s;e from the &s;tate of other organs in the machine, that are worthy of ob&s;ervation, and nece&s;&s;arily combined with tho&s;e already pointed out; we mu&s;t now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> leave to de&s;cribe them al&s;o with their u&s;es, but fir&s;t we &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;omething on&mdash;</P>
<P>THE THORAX or BREAST. This is a large cavity, &s;ome|what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;hape of a cone, reaching from the lower part of the neck to the abdomen or lower belly, from which it is divided by the diaphragm, or midriff. The bones which form this cavity are twelve vertebrae of the back behind, twelve ribs on each &s;ide, and the &s;ternum or brea&s;t bone before. This cavity is con|&s;iderably &s;horter before than behind, from the diaphragm &s;lanting downwards, and backwards. The ribs which guard the greate&s;t part of the cavity of the thorax, are all articulated with their re&s;pective vertebrae, in &s;uch a manner as to admit of a motion upwards and downwards; they are all, except the lowermo&s;t or twelfth rib, connected and articulated with the &s;ternum, or brea&s;t bone; by the intervention of cartilages, or gri&s;tles, &s;o as to ad|mit of the &s;ame motion upwards and downwards.</P>
<P>From the &s;tructure of the ribs which are more or le&s;s arched, being convex outwardly, and concave inwardly towards the ca|vity of the thorax, it follows, that if the ribs are all moved up|wards, round their articulation with the vertebrae, their arched middle parts mu&s;t be pu&s;hed outwards and laterally, and the &s;ternum, to which they are joined, outwards and forwards; and con&s;equently, the cavity of the thorax will be widened and en|larged.</P>
<P>But there is a &s;et of mu&s;cles which perform this office, which are called interco&s;tals, from their being &s;ituated between the ribs, and are both internal and external; they run obliquely from the edges of one rib to tho&s;e of the ribs neare&s;t each other, for the whole length of the ribs, and from the highe&s;t rib to the lowe&s;t: the fibres of the external have a direction contrary to that of the internal, by which contrivance their joint action be|comes the more &s;teady, and the ribs being pulled in the diagon|al of tho&s;e two directions, endeavour to pull the ribs nearer one another; drawing the inferior ribs nearer the &s;uperior, and thus
<PB N="33" REF="028021_0029_0FD6702722A28BF0">
the cavity of the thorax is widened, that the lungs may expand them&s;elves in in&s;piration.</P>
<P>But there is another contrivance to promote this purpo&s;e; the DIAPHRAGM or MIDRIFF. This mu&s;cle, which divides the brea&s;t from the lower belly, ari&s;es from the brea&s;t bone be|fore, from all the ribs on each &s;ide, from the &s;eventh to the twelfth; and behind from the la&s;t vertebrae of the thorax, and the fir&s;t one of the two loins. Its fibres run fle&s;hy from the cir|cumference to the center &s;ome way, and then become tendinous; the whole diaphragm &s;lants, its anterior origins being remarka|bly higher than its po&s;terior ones; it is not plain, but remarka|bly convex towards the thorax, and concave towards the abdo|men; in&s;omuch that its middle or center ri&s;es always higher in the thorax than its highe&s;t origin at the &s;ternum; when it acts, the fle&s;hy fibres &s;hortening, pulls the tendinous center towards their origin, that is, downwards, thereby rendering it plainer, and le&s;s convex, and &s;o lengthening the cavity of the thorax down; hence the enlargement of the brea&s;t is promoted two ways, by the interco&s;tal mu&s;cles rai&s;ing the ribs, and making it wider; and the action of the diaphragm rendering it longer or deeper&mdash;and by the&s;e means the &s;everal u&s;es above &s;pecified from the action of re&s;piration, is promoted. See page 28.</P>
<P>Immediately under the diaphragm lies the LIVER. It is of an irregular &s;hape&mdash;its right part fills almo&s;t all, what is called the right hypochondre, or &s;ide under the ribs below the dia|phragm, in an adult body, when &s;ound, reaching commonly no lower than the &s;hort ribs. In the foetus it is bigger, in propor|tion to the re&s;t of the body, in all its dimen&s;ions&mdash;its middle part lies in the region over the &s;tomach, called epiga&s;trium; and its left in the upper part of the left hypochondre, not reach|ing &s;o far down as the right; &s;ome of its exterior parts are &s;mooth and convex, humouring the concavity of the diaphragm; its under part is concave on the right &s;ide an&s;wering to the gut called the colon before, and the right kidney behind; its middle part, in which the gall bladder, called the ve&s;ica fellis is placed, lies over the gut, called duodenum, which touches the gall blad|der; its left part covers the &s;tomach&mdash;it is thick in the middle, and upper &s;ub&s;tance, towards its &s;ides it grows &s;lenderer, at length terminating in a thin edge; by a furrow in the interior and concave part which receives the umbilical vein, or that of the navel in the foetus, on its anterior part; and by another an|&s;wering to that backwards reaching to the po&s;terior limits of the liver, which receives the venous duct, both which canals are per|vious ve&s;&s;els in the foetus, but in the grown animal degenerate into ligaments, the liver is divided into two unequal parts call|ed

lobes; the right being much larger than the left; there is be|&s;ides, a &s;mall lobe in its po&s;terior concave part, commonly called the lobule of Spigelius; there is likewi&s;e a tran&s;ver&s;e fo&s;&s;a, or furrow, running along the middle of its concave, and under part, in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;eparating its anterior and larger from its po&s;te|rior and &s;maller part; it is attached to the diaphragm, and its weight is in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upported by ligaments from that mu&s;cle, which are productions from the membrane which lines the in&s;ide of the lower belly called peritonaeum, where it lines its concave &s;urface, and is united by other &s;uch productions, with the neighbouring parts: it is furni&s;hed with arteries from ramifications of the aorta, called coeliac, mammary, phrenic, re|nal, and cap&s;ular&mdash;but it is furni&s;hed with veins of two kinds&mdash;totally differing from each other, which cannot truly be &s;aid of any other part of the body: to wit, the vena portarum, and its branches di&s;tributed through the &s;ub&s;tance of the liver, which perform the office of arteries, carrying blood into it; and the other veins, which carry blood out of it, emptying them&s;elves into the vena cava, like the re&s;t, all over the body.</P>
<P>As the re&s;t of the arteries and veins may be compared to the trunk of a tree with its branches, &s;o may the vena portae and its different ramification, be compared to the root, trunk, and branch|es&mdash;for it is formed by a conflux of all the veins, which return the blood from the &s;tomach, omentum, &s;pleen, pancreas, inte&s;tines, and me&s;entery; and an&s;wer to the coeliac, and me&s;enteric, both &s;uperior and inferior, arteries.&mdash;It is worthy to be ob&s;erved, that all this venous &s;y&s;tem, which by its union con&s;titutes the vena portarum is unfurni&s;hed, unlike the other veins of the body, with valves; &s;o that from its trunk it may be injected backwards to the minute&s;t origins of &s;mall veins, in all the parts ju&s;t now men|tioned. The trunk of the vena portarum, thus formed, enters the liver between two eminences in the little lobe, called by the ancients, portae&mdash;that is, ridges forming a little channel or &s;treight between them: as &s;oon as it is formed into a trunk it is found to have got &s;tronger membranes or walls than other veins, and even tougher than the aorta or large artery of the bo|dy it&s;elf. This new and extraordinary &s;trength of the coats of the branches of the vena portarum, they carry with them through|out all the &s;ub&s;tance of the liver; and they are di&s;tributed from trunks to branches, &s;maller and &s;maller, in the &s;ame manner as arteries are in the other vi&s;cera.</P>
<P>Thus is blood brought into the liver by arteries, called hepatic, of the common &s;ort; and be&s;ides by the vena portarum, furni&s;h|ed with &s;trong coats, and performing the office of an artery, the only in&s;tance of that kind in the whole body. The ultimate
<PB N="35" REF="028021_0031_0FD67028778DCD40">
&s;mall capillary branches, both of the hepatic arteries, and vena portarum, terminate in minute venous twigs, which ari&s;ing all over the &s;ub&s;tance of the liver, and forming larger and larger branches by uniting together, at length open by &s;everal large mouths into the vena cava about the po&s;terior, or gibbous part of the liver.</P>
<P>The liver is &s;upplied with nerves from the interco&s;tal, and par vagum &s;o called;&mdash;they are but &s;mall in proportion to its bulk, and therefore it is not liable to violent pains.</P>
<P>The great u&s;e of the liver is to &s;eparate bile, for many good purpo&s;es in the animal oeconomy; and as it is now and then wanted more at &s;ome times, than at others, there is in the liver a receptacle for part of this fluid, called the GALL-BLADDER, which is a pretty large hollow ve&s;&s;el, nearly the &s;hape of an ob|long pear&mdash;&s;ituated in a fovea or furrow, in the anterior concave part of the right lobe of the liver, reaching from before back|wards; attached to the liver in different places by a cellular tex|ture, covered over in its under part, by a portion of the mem|brane of the liver, which reaching beyond it keeps it fa&s;t in its &s;ituation. Under this, all over its &s;urface, is a cellular texture&mdash;next to that, a thin mu&s;cular coat, con&s;i&s;ting of pretty con&s;pi|cuous, longitudinal, oblique, and circular fibres; under that a &s;econd cellular&mdash;then a nervous; and innermo&s;t of all a villous coat, &s;imilar to what is found in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines. There are likewi&s;e, e&s;pecially in its &s;maller part or neck, pores, which yield a mucous juice, to defend it again&s;t the acrimony of the bile: from the &s;ame part is produced its duct, which &s;tretch|ing towards the left is in&s;erted into one called the <HI>hepatic duct,</HI> which ari&s;es from the repeated union, and conflux of the biliary ducts all over the liver; the union of the&s;e two ducts together forms the duct, called the <HI>ductus communis cholidochus,</HI> which penetrates into the duodenum, or fir&s;t of the &s;mall guts, ju&s;t be|low the &s;tomach. Thus we find the bile &s;eparated by the pori biliarii of the liver, pa&s;&s;es into the hepatic duct, part of which is con&s;tantly pouring into the duodenum, and part into the gall-bladder, who&s;e u&s;e is to receive the bile, there to retain it, until it be &s;queezed back again by pre&s;&s;ure of the di&s;tended &s;tomach, and action of the diaphragm, through the ductus communis into the duodenum;&mdash;by &s;taying there, the bile is tendered thicker, &s;ome of its aqueous parts being re&s;orbed by the inhaling ve&s;&s;els of its villous coat, and therefore &s;tronger, and of a more &s;aturat|ed yellow; it likewi&s;e becomes more &s;harp, bitter, and rancid, by the heat of the contiguous and circumjacent parts; while the &s;tomach is empty the gall-bladder is at liberty to be di&s;tended and filled, and therefore becomes fuller after long fa&s;ting; and
<PB N="36" REF="028021_0032_0FD66FF7AF91EEC8">
the fuller it is, the le&s;s compre&s;&s;ion of the &s;tomach is required to &s;queeze the bile out of it&mdash;&s;o that the more we are prompted to eat, and &s;tuff the &s;tomach by violent hunger, the greater quanti|ty of bile will be poured into the duodenum, by the &s;welling of the &s;tomach during dige&s;tion, to promote &s;o much more effectu|ally the coction of the aliments; and the cy&s;tic bile will be the &s;harper, and &s;tronger, by having remained &s;o much the longer in the gall-bladder.</P>
<P>So that we find the duodenum receives two &s;orts of bile flow|ing into it from the &s;ame canal, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the hepatic fre&s;h &s;ecreted from the liver, which never has been in the gall-bladder, but goes &s;traight on into the inte&s;tines, and the cy&s;tic al&s;o.</P>
<P>Both biles are of the &s;ame natures and properties, differing only in degree, in&s;omuch as many &s;pecies of animals have no gall-bladder, and therefore are only furni&s;hed with hepatic bile, as among&s;t quadrupeds, the <HI>elephant, hor&s;e, a&s;s,</HI> and <HI>deer;</HI> among&s;t birds, the <HI>o&s;trich,</HI> who&s;e dige&s;tion is &s;o &s;trong, the <HI>&s;tork,</HI> and the <HI>pigeon</HI>&mdash;not to mention &s;ome fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The BILE is &s;omewhat vi&s;cid; coagulable by heat and alcho|hol; of a &s;aturated yellow colour, inclining to green, extremely bitter; the &s;harpe&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;timulating of all the circulating humours of the body, neither acid nor alkali when fre&s;h, but &s;trongly inclining to, and quickly &s;u&s;ceptible of, putrefaction; and promoting that di&s;po&s;ition in any &s;ub&s;tances with which it is mixed, if they are capable of it; it mixes readily with water, it flames not in the fire, unle&s;s it be dried, and then it burns almo&s;t all away; it is a powerful penetrating &s;oap in every re&s;pect; it di&s;&s;olves all gums and re&s;ins, being rubbed with them.</P>
<P>By the&s;e properties, when poured upon the alimentary ma&s;h in the duodenum, it mu&s;t effect, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> a more intimate di&s;&s;olution, and mixture of the heterogeneous parts together, as it is readily mi&s;cible with water, and renders oil and oily &s;ub&s;tances &s;o; <HI>&s;e|condly,</HI> though it is not actually an alkali, yet it nearly approach|es towards it; and mu&s;t dimini&s;h the ace&s;cent di&s;po&s;ition of the chyle, of which we &s;hall &s;peak hereafter, and render it more &s;i|milar to animal nature, which is alcale&s;cent: and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> by its &s;timulating power, as it is the mo&s;t acrimonious of all the ani|mal fluids, it, no doubt, helps to excite the peri&s;taltic motion of the inte&s;tines, and thereby promote concoction; and, as like a|loes, it is a purgative, which it re&s;embles not a little, it a&s;&s;i&s;ts in the expul&s;ion of the faeces; &s;o true is it what Lord Bacon &s;ays, "<HI>that the bile is the incentive and &s;timulus of many functions of the body.</HI>"</P>
<P>The PANCREAS, or SWEET-BREAD, &s;o called, is a long, whiti&s;h, tender, and friable glandular ma&s;s, &s;ituated behind the
<PB N="37" REF="028021_0033_0FD67029EFE5D740">
&s;tomach and &s;pleen, under the liver. Beginning at the &s;pleen on the left &s;ide, it &s;tretches tran&s;ver&s;ely acro&s;s the vertebrae, and with its other extremity, is connected with the duodenum. In the human adult, it is about &s;even or eight inches long, and one or more thick; its end at the &s;pleen is &s;malle&s;t, and it grows gradually broader, at it approaches to the duodenum, where it terminates: it hath arteries from the coeliac; its veins run into the &s;plenic vein, which opens into the vena portarum; its nerves come from the par vagnum, and as they are but &s;mall, it hath, like the liver, but &s;mall &s;en&s;ation: its &s;tructure con&s;i&s;ts of &s;mall round acini or glandular &s;hoots, connected together with much cellular texture; from each of the&s;e, there is a &s;mall duct &s;ent out towards the middle; all the&s;e ducts open into the principal duct, which runs along its axis all its length, and opens into the duodenum, five or &s;ix inches from the pylorus, or lower orifice of the &s;tomach, at the &s;ame place with the biliary duct.</P>
<P>As the &s;tructure of the pancreas is the &s;ame with the &s;alivary glands, &s;o its juice perfectly re&s;embles the &s;aliva in every proper|ty&mdash;and therefore may be pre&s;umed to have the &s;ame u&s;e&mdash;to di|late, open, and di&s;&s;olve the alimentary ma&s;h, and render the chyle, to be made out of it, more &s;imilar to animal nature; as it is con|&s;iderably larger than all the &s;alivary glands put together, and &s;i|tuated in a warmer place, its juice mu&s;t far exceed the &s;aliva in quantity. It is propelled into the inte&s;tine by the common im|petus and cour&s;e of circulation, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the pre&s;&s;ure of the adjacent parts upon it in breathing: It is poured into the gut at the &s;ame place with the biliary duct, that it may be immediate|ly mixed with, in order to temper and dilute, the bile, which is both thicker and &s;harper than it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The OMENTUM, or CAWL, is a broad membrane, thin and tran&s;parent, tender, and ea&s;ily torn, ari&s;ing from the anterior and inferior border of the &s;tomach, and falling down commonly as low as the navel, &s;ometimes much lower; then doubling backwards and upwards, is connected with the inte&s;tine called the colon, un|der the &s;tomach, thus forming an empty bag. Be&s;ides, its prin|cipal connection with the &s;tomach and colon, it is likewi&s;e at|tached to the duodenum, to the &s;pleen, pancreas, and me&s;entery; it lies immediately under the peritoneum forwards. being a pro|duction of its cellular part, and covers part of the &s;tomach, and the greate&s;t part of the anterior &s;urface of the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>It is every where a double membrane&mdash;but every portion of the thin membrane, by it&s;elf, may be divided into two thinner membranes or &s;loughs, which are joined together by a thin cel|lular texture, in the cells of which fat is depo&s;ited: the &s;ecretion here is performed in the mo&s;t &s;imple manner, their being no o|ther

apparatus be&s;ides arteries, veins, and pinguidinous ducts, leading to the cells, or ve&s;icles. The fat is di&s;tributed in the o|mentum very unequally, being in &s;ome places thin and tran&s;pa|rent, in others an inch thick in fat; in corpulent per&s;ons it con|tains a va&s;t quantity of fat; it hath its arteries from the coeliac; its veins terminate chiefly in the &s;plenic branch, and all of them ultimately in the vena portarum.</P>
<P>The u&s;es of the omentum are, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> to interpo&s;e between the peritoneum and the inte&s;tines, and part of the &s;tomach&mdash;that all three parts may be pre&s;erved warm, moi&s;t, and &s;lippery, and hin|dered from growing together: and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> to furni&s;h oily mat|ter for the bile.</P>
<P>The SPLEEN is &s;ituated in the left hypochondre, that is, under the cartilages of the left &s;hort ribs; it is connected with the colon, &s;tomach, left kidney, and by its upper part with the diaphragm; its &s;ituation is changed by the fulne&s;s or emptine&s;s of the &s;tomach; it follows the motion of the diaphragm, and is affected by the inflation or &s;ub&s;idence of the colon. In general it is placed up|wards, and backwards from about the middle of the &s;hort ribs on the left &s;ide; in its natural and &s;ound &s;tate, it is about &s;ix or &s;e|ven inches long, about three in breadth, and one in thickne&s;s, of an irregular and &s;omewhat oval figure, and of a dark livid colour; it receives arteries from the coeliac, the&s;e entering its &s;ub&s;tance, are divided into innumerable branches, and by their evane&s;cent extremities terminate in minute veins, forming, by their union, the &s;plenic vein, which flows into the vena portarum. The ve&s;|&s;els of the &s;pleen are very large in proportion to its bulk, and yet it hath no excretory canal but its vein; its nerves are &s;mall and few.</P>
<P>As the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;pleen is entirely va&s;cular, with a ten|der cellular texture to &s;upport the ve&s;&s;els and keep them toge|ther; its chief u&s;e has been con&s;idered to con&s;i&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dividing and attenuating the blood that runs into and flows through it; and from its &s;ituation, as it is much agitated, this al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ts in the circulation and comminution of the blood through it, and thereby rendering it fit to temper the &s;luggi&s;h ma&s;s &s;ent from the omentum and me&s;entery into the vena portarum, and expe|dite the &s;ecretion of bile in the liver.</P>

When the former act, they &s;horten and widen the tube&mdash;thus fitting it to receive aliment; when the latter exert them&s;elves, they render it narrower and longer, and propel the aliment onwards: this alternate action, begun at the origin of the canal, and continued downwards &s;ucce&s;&s;ively through its different portions, one after another, determines the rout of the aliment into the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>Its innermo&s;t coat, called nervous, is tough and &s;trong, fit to re&s;i&s;t the hardne&s;s and roughne&s;s of what may be &s;wallowed; it is lined with &s;hort villi, &s;tanding up like velvet, &s;omewhat in the manner of tho&s;e of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, of which we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;peak. There are likewi&s;e numerous &s;ecretory ducts opening into it, which yield a mucous liquid, by which it is moi&s;tened and lubricated, in order to facilitate the pa&s;&s;age of the aliment through its cavity.</P>
<P>The STOMACH, or VENTRICLE, is &s;ituated in the abdo|men, or lower belly, immediately under the liver, which covers a great part of it above, and laterally; it is placed tran&s;ver&s;ely, in the main, from right to left, but &s;omewhat obliquely, &s;o that its left or upper orifice, called cardia, which is continued to the oe&s;opha|gus, lies more towards the vetebrae; and the right or lower, called pylorus, which opens into the inte&s;tine duodenum, more anterior. In figure it re&s;embles a bag-pipe; its thicke&s;t part be|ing its left extremity, at the implantation of the oe&s;ophagus, from which it tapers to the pylorus. The CARTILAGO ENSIFOR|MIS, or lower part of the brea&s;t bone, an&s;wers nearly to its mid|dle: the &s;pleen lies contiguous to its lower part, on the left, and the pancreas behind its bottom.</P>
<P>The &s;tructure of the &s;tomach is in general the &s;ame as the oe&s;ophagus, of which it may be con&s;idered a dilatation. Its mo&s;t external membrane is a continuation of the peritoneum; its next is cellular, in which its great branches of blood ve&s;&s;els and nerves run; in it there are likewi&s;e conglobate glands and lymphatic ve&s;&s;els. Under this lies the mu&s;cular coat&mdash;the exte|rior layer is a continuation of the longitudinal fibres of the oe&s;o|phagus, which open and di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves over the &s;tomach&mdash;and as the &s;tomach is by much the larger of the two, and of an irregular figure, they mu&s;t of cour&s;e be thinner, and le&s;s nu|merous in &s;ome places than others. They run mo&s;tly along the length of the &s;tomach, and terminate at the pylorus; they &s;eem to &s;horten the &s;tomach, though but in a feeble manner, and

widen its middle. The other &s;tratum or layer, an&s;wering to the circular fibres of the oe&s;ophagus, is by much the &s;tronger of the two; its fibres run in a general way round the &s;tomach, at right angles with its axis, though with con&s;iderable and intricate deviations: they &s;eem like the analogous &s;tratum in the oe&s;o|phagus, to lengthen the tube they encircle, and contract its ca|vity, a remarkable plain of this &s;ame &s;tratum runs from the left orifice to the right by the &s;horte&s;t way, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> along the up|per and le&s;&s;er curvature of the &s;tomach; and appears to coun|teract its other fibres, by drawing the two orifices towards each other. And it is ob&s;erved, that at the entry of the oe&s;ophagus into the &s;tomach, the circular fibres are remarkably thick and &s;trong, which therefore may &s;erve, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as a &s;phincter to it, to &s;huts its cavity there; but, upon the whole, the exact cour&s;e of the mu&s;cular fibres of the &s;tomach is &s;o ex|tremely difficult to be traced and de&s;cribed, that hardly any two anatomi&s;ts, unle&s;s they copy from one another, agree in their account of them. It is &s;ufficient to conceive them to be &s;o fra|med and di&s;tributed, as to enable the &s;tomach to pre&s;s upon its contents every way, and gradually to expel them.&mdash;Next to, and immediately under the mu&s;cular coat, is another cellular texture, more con&s;picuous than the exterior one, in which pretty large trunks of blood ve&s;&s;els and nerves run, after having penetrated through the mu&s;cular coat. Under it lies that called nervous which is a firm, tough, white, and pretty thick membrane, con&s;tituting the principal and mo&s;t peculiar coat of the &s;tomach. The &s;ixth in number is another cellular web, much thinner and more &s;ubtile than the two former&mdash;made up of &s;horter threads and laminoe&mdash;The innermo&s;t of all is the villous coat, &s;o called, becau&s;e it hath villi, or pile like that of velvet, &s;tanding out from it; the&s;e villi are &s;mall membranous productions, or &s;heaths containing minute tubuli, both of the arterial and venous kind, opening into the cavity of the &s;tomach. The arterial tu|buli pour into the &s;tomach a liquor much more &s;ubtile than blood, to be mixed with the aliments for the purpo&s;e of dige&s;ti|on&mdash;and when the &s;tomach is empty, this liquor growing &s;harper concurs with the &s;aliva in exciting the &s;en&s;e of hunger, as has been &s;aid; the venous tubuli are ab&s;orbent, and re&s;orb liquids from the &s;tomach; the innermo&s;t or villous coat being larger than the re&s;t, forms wrinkles here and there, more or le&s;s con|&s;picuous, but at the pylorus there is a remarkable one; where a duplicature of the coat formed by this wrinkle all round the pylorus, and projecting into the entry of the duodenum, &s;erves, together with the circular fibres of the mu&s;cular coat, to con|tract,
<PB N="41" REF="028021_0037_0FD6702DBA53BF58">
and almo&s;t &s;hut that orifice, and let only the thinner parts of the alimentary ma&s;h be expelled out of the &s;tomach into the inte&s;tine very gradually, and in &s;mall quantities at once; over all the in&s;ide of the villous coat, there open excretory ducts of mucous glands, &s;eated in the &s;econd cellular membrane, which furni&s;h a lubricating liquor, as in the oe&s;ophagus, &s;erving to de|fend the acutely &s;entient in&s;ide of the &s;tomach from the acrimo|ny or otherwi&s;e hurtful qualities of what we may eat or drink.</P>
<P>The &s;tomach is plentifully furni&s;hed with blood ve&s;&s;els; its arteries all come from the coeliac, and its veins all empty them|&s;elves into the vena portarum: it is no le&s;s largely &s;upplied with nerves, every branch of which ari&s;e from the par vagnum.</P>
<P>Now the u&s;e of this organ is for the dige&s;tion of our food, in order to promote the nouri&s;hment of the other parts of the body, as well as it&s;elf&mdash;and this it is &s;uppo&s;ed to promote by heat, moi&s;ture, agitation, and fermentation&mdash;all which, that it is capable of producing, it will be ea&s;y to conceive, when we con&s;ider its &s;tructure and &s;ituation&mdash;for we find it is almo&s;t covered with the liver, lies contiguous to the &s;pleen and pancreas&mdash;is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mu&s;cular coat&mdash;has large trunks of blood ve&s;&s;els running thro' its &s;ub&s;tances&mdash;lies clo&s;e under the diaphragm&mdash;and fluids pro|fu&s;ely excreted into its cavity, and perpetually pre&s;&s;ing down the oe&s;ophagus&mdash;be&s;ides its lying over the aorta, or great artery of the machine&mdash;and thus the texture of the aliment is broken, the juices they afford &s;et at liberty, mixed with the ga&s;tric juices, or tho&s;e of the &s;tomach, thrown into a &s;tate of fermentation, and changed into materials proper for forming nutritious fluids, as far as the fir&s;t proce&s;s extends&mdash;which are farther perfected when they pa&s;s into the inte&s;tines, who&s;e &s;tructure is &s;imilar to that of the &s;to|mach&mdash;by being mixed with bile, pancreatic, and inte&s;tinal fluids; converting them into a white liquor called chyle, which is ab&s;orbed by the lacteal ve&s;&s;els, and there in their pa&s;&s;age through the lym|phatic glands to the receptaculum chyli further mixed and di|luted with lymph; from this receptaculum the chyle is carried into the vena cava, thrown with the blood into the right auricle of the heart, thence into the right ventricle, which ejects it into the lungs, by the pulmonary artery, in which organ it is further elaborated, thrown from thence into the left auricle and vetricle, and then into the round of the greater circulation, where it meets with fre&s;h attrition; and thus, in a little time, converted into a perfectly nutritive fluid, which is applied to the particular parts for their &s;upport as wanted. But the &s;tomach, be&s;ides being the in&s;trument for performing the fir&s;t proce&s;s of dige&s;tion, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of another material power, that of promoting sympathic af|fections in the con&s;titution.

<P>The DUODENUM is wider than the others&mdash;as it received all the ma&s;h expelled out of the &s;tomach; which cannot be &s;aid of the other guts, &s;ome part thereof being re&s;orbed by the way, but chiefly on account of its having, for a great part of its length, from its origin progre&s;&s;ively, no external tough covering from the me&s;entery to limit its &s;ize; it is likewi&s;e redder and more fle&s;hy than the jejunum and ileum, its mu&s;cular fibres being thick|er and &s;tronger. About its middle it receives the duct from the pancreas and liver, called pancreatic and biliary, which pa&s;&s;ing through its coat, obliquely open into it through one orifice; it makes &s;everal curvatures&mdash;the mo&s;t con&s;iderable is that by which it a&s;cends almo&s;t perpendicularly &s;ome way, &s;oon after the two ducts open into its cavity, whereby the alimentary ma&s;h mu&s;t needs be &s;omewhat retarded in its pa&s;&s;age through it; and the bile and pancreatic juice the more thoroughly mixed therewith, and with one another; in its beginning, its innermo&s;t coat is even, with|out wrinkles or furrows, &s;uch as are called valvulae conniventes; but in its progre&s;s, and towards its terminations, it gets many &s;uch; which mu&s;t further retard the progre&s;s of its contents; it is &s;upplied with arteries chiefly from the &s;ame trunk that &s;upplies the &s;tomach, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the coeliac; &s;ome lacteals, though but few ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P>The JEJUNUM.&mdash;It is not ea&s;y to fix exactly the limits be|tween the duodenum, nor ileum, and this gut: one way of di&s;|tingui&s;hing the jejunum from the ileum, and perhaps the be&s;t, is to call all that jejunum, who&s;e circumvolutions are above the umbilicus, or navel; and who&s;e cavities are remarkably furni&s;h|ed with rugae or valvulae conniventes; this will make it about a third &s;horter than the ileum; it is narrower than the duode|num; its mu&s;cular fibres are thinner and weaker; it has &s;ome clu&s;ters of glands, called Peyer's, from their di&s;coverer, and &s;ends forth numerous lacteals.</P>
<P>The ILEUM makes its windings chiefly below the umbilicus;
<PB N="43" REF="028021_0039_0FD6702F2D1D8B98">
the lateral foldings are &s;upported by the o&s;&s;a ilia, above the thigh bones; its &s;tructure is much the &s;ame with that of the jejunum, except that in it the valvulae conniventes decrea&s;e gradually, both in number and &s;ize, till at length they di&s;appear. It hath more of Peyer's glands than the two former, e&s;pecially about its ter|mination, and &s;ends forth extremely numerous lacteal ve&s;&s;els, the jejunum and it furni&s;hing almo&s;t the whole of the&s;e canals: it is con&s;iderably longer than the jejunum, and is continued to the fir&s;t of the thick guts called colon. Both the jejunum and ileum are furni&s;hed with blood ve&s;&s;els from the me&s;enterica &s;uperior. The&s;e &s;mall guts are the in&s;truments immediately employed in making the chyle: who&s;e coats are pretty much the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>The thick or large guts are al&s;o three in number&mdash;the CAE|CUM, COLON, and RECTUM.</P>
<P>The ileum, the la&s;t of the &s;mall guts, terminating near the right kidney, opens into the colon; at its junction with the CAE|CUM: this is a &s;hort wide &s;ac about three inches long; its diame|ter about thrice as large as that of the &s;mall inte&s;tines: it is &s;itu|ated under the right kidney, and hid by the la&s;t convolution of the ileum, and has an appendix ari&s;ing laterally from its bottom, called appendicula vermiformis, and is about the &s;ame length, but very &s;lender, its diameter commonly not exceeding a quarter of an inch; its termination is &s;hut, and it fluctuates loo&s;e.</P>
<P>The COLON from its origin makes a large turn upwards as far as the liver; then proceeds tran&s;ver&s;ely to the left under the gall-bladder, which it touches under the bottom of the &s;tomach, towards the &s;pleen and le&s;t kidney, to which it is fa&s;tened; from thence pa&s;&s;ing, it makes &s;everal turns, the whole of them pretty much in the figure of a capital S inverted, then terminates in the rectum; &s;o that it &s;urrounds, in a manner, the whole abdomen, &s;ometimes a&s;cending, &s;ometimes de&s;cending; hence it happens that one &s;tool is often &s;ucceeded by a &s;econd: by this contrivance likewi&s;e the faeces are longer kept, and hindered from being eve|ry now and then indecently voided.</P>
<P>The RECTUM or STRAIGHT GUT, &s;o called becau&s;e its cour&s;e, if the length of the body is regarded, is &s;traight, though it is bent backwards and forwards, humouring the direction of the os &s;acrum and os coccygis, bones &s;ituated at the lower part of the back, begins where the la&s;t curvatures of the colon end, and is terminated at the anus.</P>
<P>It is worthy to be ob&s;erved, that there is a remarkable con|trivance at the junction of the ileum with the colon and caecum, by which the contents of the &s;mall inte&s;tines are allowed a free pa&s;&s;age into the thick ones, but &s;mall regre&s;s or retropul&s;ion from
<PB N="44" REF="028021_0040_0FD66FFE6F552448">
the latter into the former is effectually hindered and &s;topped, this is called, valvuli Bauhini&mdash;Tulpii, or&mdash;Coli. Its effect in the animal oeconomy is very &s;alutary; for as the contents of the inte&s;tines begin to putrify, and become foetid in the caecum, by their being retarded there, both upon account of its capaciou&s;ne&s;s, and the almo&s;t perpendicular a&s;cent of the colon, which is conti|nued from it, if their repul&s;ion into the ileum was not effectually hindered, the chyle in the &s;mall guts would be tainted with pu|tridity, and even excrementitious matter thrown up at the mouth in ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s; whereas not &s;o much as a faecal halitus, or the &s;ubtile&s;t effluvia, can get that way in a &s;tate of health, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould be wanting ten or twelve days together, as happens in a common way to many.</P>
<P>The caecum being much wider than the &s;mall inte&s;tines, and at the &s;ame time lower than the implantation of the ileum, the contents mu&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nate there, e&s;pecially as the colon from its origin mounts in a manner perpendicularly as far as the liver in the right hypochondre. By &s;tagnating in &s;o warm a place, their putridity increa&s;es there, and they acquire a faecal odour, which is not ob&s;erved in the contents of the &s;mall guts; they likewi&s;e become le&s;s fluid, and more con&s;i&s;tent, by the re|&s;orption of the more liquid parts through the lacteals and other bibulous veins, &s;till continuing.</P>
<P>The vermicular appendix of the caecum, by the numerous glandular outlets in its cavity, &s;erves, as well as a receptacle for the meconium in the foetus, to lubricate the contents and mem|branes of the caecum, into which it opens, as well as its own, in order to facilitate the propu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ion of the faecal matter, and prevent its adhe&s;ion to the coats of the caecum and its own, and where it mu&s;t &s;tagnate longer than it had &s;tagnated hitherto any where in the inte&s;tinal tract. This u&s;e likewi&s;e takes place in the born animal; and be&s;ides in ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s, by affording more room or &s;towage for the conge&s;ted faeces it renders that com|plaint more ea&s;y to be borne, and le&s;s detrimental than it other|wi&s;e might be.</P>
<P>The caecum and colon, be&s;ides having a &s;tronger mu&s;cular coat than the &s;mall inte&s;tines, are furni&s;hed with three ligament-like bands, running length-ways on their out&s;ide, dividing their &s;ur|face into three portions, nearly equal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. Though they appear like ligaments externally, they are made up in their inner &s;tructure of true mu&s;cular fibres, and &s;trengthen the longitudinal fibres of the mu&s;cular coat; as they are longer than the proper coats, they keep them drawn up into folds or wrinkles.</P>
<P>Through the&s;e inte&s;tines is propelled and urged on the remain|der of the alimentary ma&s;h, after having undergone the action of
<PB N="45" REF="028021_0041_0FD67034A468F7F8">
the &s;mall guts; it con&s;i&s;ts of the earthy part of the materials tak|en in for food&mdash;of the membranous, fibrous, cartilaginous, and bony parts, that could not be &s;ufficiently broken, and comminut|ed by the &s;tomach or inte&s;tines &s;o as to be taken up by the lacte|al, and other ab&s;orbing ve&s;&s;els; the recrements of the bile, and mucus furni&s;hed by Peyer's glands, all mixed together.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es of its propul&s;ion are the &s;ame as in the &s;mall guts, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the action of re&s;piration, and the peri&s;taltic motion of the inte&s;tines them&s;elves; but its cour&s;e is &s;lower than in the &s;mall guts, upon the account of its thicker con&s;i&s;tence, the a&s;cent and windings of the colon, the delay it meets with from furrows within the tube, and the great &s;top from hard faeces, pent up in the rectum by the &s;phincter ani. The putridity is increa&s;ed as it goes on; and as putrefaction generates air, the colon is com|monly found di&s;tended with flatulency. The whole is more and more gradually exhau&s;ted and robbed of its mo&s;t fluid parts; and as what putrid mia&s;mata are ab&s;orbed by the me&s;ocolic veins, are determined finally into the vena portarum, to contribute towards the rancidity and putre&s;cent di&s;po&s;ition of the bile, &s;o that even here the faeces, which are upon the point of being expelled out of the body altogether, are rendered u&s;eful and made &s;ub&s;ervient to the perfection of what is left behind.</P>
<P>The RECTUM begins in the pelvis where the la&s;t curvatures of the colon end; its mu&s;cular coat is much &s;tronger than in the other inte&s;tines; the ligament-like bands, which in the caecum and colon are collected into three portions, are &s;pread equally over its &s;urface, that no part of it may be weaker than another, le&s;t it &s;hould give way in the effort of throwing out its contents. Into this inte&s;tine the faecal matter, now con&s;i&s;tent and &s;haped by the cylindrical cavity of the colon, e&s;pecially in its la&s;t curva|tures, where it is more uniform, and not &s;o much di&s;tended by flatulency, is received and accumulated therein, until, by its in|crea&s;ed bulk, weight, and acrimony, it becomes trouble&s;ome, and would prove hurtful if long retained. Then it is expelled by the mu&s;cular powers furni&s;hed for that purpo&s;e&mdash;and &s;trong powers there are and admirably fitted to an&s;wer their end.</P>
<P>The INTESTINES are not left to move at random in the ca|vity of the abdomen, but artfully tied down by a membranous web, which prevents their circumvolutions from being entangled in each other&mdash;at the &s;ame time allowing them a gentle but limit|ed motion. That part of it, which is connected with the &s;mall inte&s;tines, is called me&s;entery; the other part fa&s;tened to the colon, me&s;o-colon. The rectum has a particular membrane al|lotted to it&s;elf for fixing it.</P>
<P>This membranous web, for the me&s;entery, and me&s;o-colon

are one continued membrane, is a double production of the peri|toneum, ari&s;ing from the vertebrae of the loins; its two laminae are joined together by a cellular texture, in which the lacteals, blood ve&s;&s;els, &amp;c. run, and the me&s;enteric glands are placed: when this double membrane hath arrived at the inte&s;tines, its laminae &s;eparate and quite &s;urround them, thus furni&s;hing their external covering.</P>
<P>Upon a &s;light &s;urvey of the u&s;es produced by the mechani&s;m of this part of the human machine, we cannot avoid being &s;truck with wonder at its apparent &s;implicity, an&s;wering &s;o many &s;alu|tary purpo&s;es. If we trace the materials thrown into the &s;to|mach for our &s;upport through the inte&s;tinal tube, we mu&s;t more and more admire the excellency of the divine workman&s;hip; for as &s;oon as we take our food it is received into a place, in all points calculated to render it fit for yielding its nutritious con|tents, by mixing with the &s;alivary and ga&s;tric juices&mdash;having its texture broken by mu&s;cular action, not only of its own coats but the organs of re&s;piration, and the quickly repeated &s;hocks of the large&s;t artery in the human machine, and from heat, increa&s;|ed from its &s;ituation, &s;oon thrown into the proce&s;s of fermenta|tion&mdash;by all which it is rendered fluxile, and pa&s;&s;es, from the contrivance at the lower orifice of the &s;tomach, &s;lowly into the head of the fir&s;t of the inte&s;tines&mdash;more capacious than its infe|rior part; it is there mixed with the bile, increa&s;ed in its quan|tity in proportion only as it is wanted, by the very means of tho&s;e things which require it, and pancreatic juice, calculated to convert the various portions into a nutritious fluid, by mixing the parts uniformly together, at the &s;ame time affording a &s;timu|lus to promote the propul&s;ive force of the inte&s;tines, and con&s;e|quently increa&s;e the action of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els implanted in the &s;ides of them to convey it through the me&s;enteric glands, where it re|ceives more liquid, thinner than it&s;elf, to increa&s;e its fluxility into the receptacle appropriated for this purpo&s;e, and from thence into the blood&mdash;the faeculent, or thicker part, being at the &s;ame time pu&s;hed forwards into the larger bowels, from whence there can happen no regurgitation of any, even of its finer parts, tho' delayed for &s;ome time, in order that a portion of its alkale&s;cent or &s;timulating materials may be carried through the vena porta|rum, into the liver, to increa&s;e the acrimony of the bile; and as here the faeces acquire a greater hardne&s;s, con&s;equently &s;tand in need of a greater force to propel them forwards for their exit, the bowels in this place are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of greater &s;trength, and require a &s;tronger &s;timulus to excite them to more powerful ac|tion, which the putre&s;cent &s;tate of the faeces, acquired by delay, affords.</P>

the cour&s;e of the &s;ub&s;equent &s;heets.&mdash;We mu&s;t now avert to the kidneys.</P>
<P>The KIDNEYS are two pretty &s;olid glandular bodies, &s;ituat|ed in the po&s;terior part of the cavity of the abdomen, on each &s;ide of the vertebrae of the loins, between the la&s;t fal&s;e rib, and the o&s;&s;a iliaca or hip bones. The right kidney lies under the great lobe of the liver, the left under the &s;pleen, and therefore is high|er; they are commonly about five inches long, about three broad, and one and a half thick; they are connected with the colon, duodenum, liver, and &s;pleen, by the productions of the peritone|um. They are in &s;hape not unlike a large bean, their circum|ference being convex on one &s;ide, and concave on the other&mdash;the concave &s;ide is turned towards the vertebrae, or back bone.</P>
<P>The Kidneys are &s;urrounded with a loo&s;e cellular texture, in which there is much fat; this likewi&s;e inve&s;ts the arteries and veins of the kidneys. The proper coat or membrane of the kid|neys is double, being compo&s;ed of two laminae, or layers&mdash;be|twixt which there is a very fine cellular texture; the external laminae is very thin, and only &s;urrounds the body of the kidney; the internal one penetrates every where by numerous elongations into the &s;ub&s;tance of the kidney, from which it cannot be &s;epa|rated without tearing. The &s;ub&s;tance of the Kidneys is &s;mooth, even, and uniform in adults&mdash;in young children divided in a man|ner into &s;everal lobes and tubercles, or portions.</P>
<P>They are &s;upplied with very large blood ve&s;&s;els&mdash;commonly called emulgents. The arteries ari&s;e from the great de&s;cending artery of the heart, nearly at right angles, one large trunk for each kidney; they run horizontally to the kidneys, and common|ly without divi&s;ion&mdash;and having &s;ent off branches to the external &s;urface of the kidney, the chief trunk enters into its body at its concave part, and is di&s;tributed by an infinite number of &s;mall branches over all its &s;ub&s;tance. The veins running along with the arteries open in a large trunk from each kidney into the ca|va de&s;cendens, or large de&s;cending vein, near that part of the aor|ta where the arteries ari&s;e.</P>
<P>If the kidney is cut through its convex, towards its concave part, into two equal portions, there appears a three-fold &s;ub&s;tance compo&s;ing its body&mdash;the exterior part called cortical, round the whole circumference of the kidney, of a bright, whiti&s;h, grey colour;&mdash;a middle &s;ub&s;tance, called medullary, &s;triated, or &s;treak|ed, which terminates in the third, called papillary, as it ends in eleven or twelve papillae, or nipples, from the ends of which the urine drops through &s;everal &s;mall holes in the cavity of the kidney.</P>
<P>The intimate &s;tructure of the kidney is entirely va&s;cular&mdash;the
<PB N="49" REF="028021_0045_0FD67035F5FA8EC8">
&s;mall arterial branches proceeding towards the papillae are reflect|ed back with &s;erpentine circumvolutions towards the &s;urface of the kidney, then are bent again towards the papillae and, at length, &s;end off &s;traight urinary ducts perforating the papillae, and tending to the cavity of the kidney called pelvis, which is continued to the ureter, a ve&s;&s;el which runs into the bladder.</P>
<P>The pelvis, which is truly the head of the ureter, is the re&s;er|voir into which the urine drops from all the urinary ducts or tu|buli. It is formed by the confluence of three large urinary ca|nals, into which the &s;mall urinary ducts open by holes laterally. This cavity, or pelvis, is &s;traitened at length into the ureter, one to each kidney; &s;o that the kidney may be imagined to be a va&s;|cular congeries, con&s;i&s;ting of arteries, uriniferous ducts, or tho&s;e which convey urine, and veins, all running together over the &s;ub&s;tance of the kidney; the urinary ducts opening at length in|to the great urinary re&s;ervoir, or pelvis, which terminates in the ureter. In the kidney there are no follicles between the la&s;t ar|terial branches, and the fir&s;t urinary ducts.</P>
<P>By this apparatus is the urine &s;eparated in the &s;ub&s;tance of the kidney and &s;ent into the ureter: the va&s;t largene&s;s of the emul|gent arteries, and their proximity or nearne&s;s to the heart &s;hew, that a great quantity of blood comes, in a &s;mall &s;pace of time, to the kidneys. Now the blood, which is newly come from the heart, mu&s;t contain a great quantity of water, as, be&s;ides our drink, and the &s;tomachic and inte&s;tinal juices, almo&s;t all the lymph of the body is poured upon the chyle, in its receptacle in the lower belly, and the duct in the thorax, immediately before it is mixed with the blood.</P>
<P>This water is impregnated with the &s;alts of the blood, and &s;ome animal oil, attenuated by the proce&s;s of concoction, or dige&s;tion, and circulation, and rendered mi&s;cible with water, and united with the&s;e &s;alts, together with &s;ubtle terre&s;trious or earthy parts, abraded from the in&s;ide of the animal tubes, con&s;titute the mat|ter of urine. The diameters of the urinary ducts are adapted to admit the&s;e, and exclude, in a &s;ound &s;tate, every thing gro&s;&s;er, as globules of blood, mere oil unattenuated, milk or chyle, and &s;erum or lymph, that is concre&s;cible by fire, urine being not &s;o; at the &s;ame time they tran&s;mit every thing that is thinner, if it arrives at the kidneys; &s;o that urine is the lixivium or ley, as it were, of the blood; by the &s;eparation of which it is edulco|rated. Its &s;alts and oils, which begin by repeated circulations to be more acrid than the tender ve&s;&s;els of the nerves and brain could bear, being wa&s;hed off, and thrown out by the urinary pa&s;|&s;ages.</P>
<P>The URETERS, ari&s;ing from the pelvis of the kidneys, run

down obliquely, and with a very &s;mall inflexion from the kid|neys to the lateral parts of the inner and anterior &s;ide of the os &s;acrum, or lower part of the back, and pa&s;&s;ing between the rec|tum and bladder, are inverted in the latter. Their &s;tructure is much a kin to that of the inte&s;tines, though the innermo&s;t coat is &s;mooth and membranous, furni&s;hed with glands &s;eparating a mucilaginous liquor to defend it again&s;t the &s;harpne&s;s of the urine; they open into the neck of the bladder on each &s;ide, pene|trating obliquely through its coats.</P>
<P>The BLADDER is a membranous and fle&s;hy &s;ac or bag, ca|pable of contraction and dilatation &s;ituated in the lower part of the abdomen or belly, immediately behind the joining of tho&s;e bones, called o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">a pubis&mdash;and oppo&s;ite to the beginning of the rectum. The figure of it is nearly a &s;hort oval&mdash;it is broader on the fore and back, than on the lateral parts, rounder above than below, when contracted; and broader above than below when di&s;tended. It is conceived, as divided into the body, neck, and bottom, into anterior and po&s;terior, and into two lateral parts, right and left.</P>
<P>The upper part is termed its bottom&mdash;its neck is part of its lower portion, with re&s;pect to its &s;ituation in the body. The bladder is not within the cavity of the peritoneum, that mem|brane only covering a part of its bottom or upper part, and com|ing down no farther anteriorly, but being reflected over the blad|der, de&s;cends, covering it, as far down as the in&s;ertion of the ureters.</P>
<P>The &s;tructure of this organ is nearly the &s;ame with that of the ureters, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> be&s;ides the peritoneum, which covers but part of it, there is fir&s;t an external cellular, under that a mu&s;cular coat; then a &s;econd cellular, then a nervous coat, and the innermo&s;t of all, a coat, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, villous, furni&s;hed with glands which &s;eparate a mucilaginous liquor, nece&s;&s;ary to defend it again&s;t the &s;harpne&s;s of the urine, which &s;tagnates within it often, for a ve|ry con&s;iderable time together.</P>
<P>The fibres in the mu&s;cular coat run in all manner of directions, the outermo&s;t, and mo&s;t remarkable &s;eries is longitudinal, run|ning from the neck upwards, and hath been thought to de&s;erve a particular name&mdash;detru&s;or urinae, expeller of urine&mdash;the others run obliquely, by different degrees of obliquity, and &s;ome alto|gether tran&s;ver&s;e: the neck, or under part of the bladder, is &s;hut by a mu&s;cular &s;phincter, like that of the anus.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of the bladder is to receive the urine which keeps con&s;tantly &s;lowing from the urinary ducts and kidneys into the pelvis and ureter&mdash;and to retain it; that it may not indecently dribble, and di&s;turb the functions of life. It &s;eems to change
<PB N="51" REF="028021_0047_0FD67037908F6910">
its nature no otherwi&s;e than by its being kept at re&s;t in a warm place, thereby becoming more acrid and &s;timulating. The urine is detained in the bladder by its &s;phincter, till by its di&s;ten&s;ion, and the acrimony of the urine, either or both, we are made, unea&s;y and endeavour to expel it through the urethra&mdash;&s;ee page 53, 54, &amp;c.&mdash;out of the body, which is done in the &s;ame manner as the faeces are thru&s;t out&mdash;by the joint action of the diaphragm, and the mu&s;cles of the abdomen, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the proper mu&s;cular coat of the bladder&mdash;and the pyramidial mu&s;cles, in a particular man|ner, favour the evacuation of the bladder, as they lie nearly over it.</P>
<P>The UTERUS, or WOMB, the habitation of the foetus, is &s;i|tuated between the urinary bladder, which is placed before it, and the inte&s;tinum rectum placed behind it. In a grown woman, not with child, it is about three finger breadths long, two in breadth, where it is broade&s;t, and one in thickne&s;s; it is of the figure of a flat fla&s;k, convex before and behind, with edges inclin|ing to &s;harp; its broade&s;t extremity, which is called its bottom, is uppermo&s;t; and its &s;mall part, called its cervix or neck, is downwards&mdash;it is covered over with a production of the perito|neum, two portions of which, one on each &s;ide, fa&s;ten it to the &s;ides of the pelvis, and are called the ligamenta lata, or broad li|gaments.</P>
<P>The womb, when impregnated, hath but a very &s;mall cavity, its walls being very thick; the cavity is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, of a tri|angular &s;hape, and it is lined with a very thin &s;mall membrane.</P>
<P>The womb is made up of a compacted cellular &s;ub&s;tance, with a copious intermixture of blood ve&s;&s;els&mdash;there appears &s;omething like mu&s;cular fibres amid&s;t the cellular &s;ub&s;tance, e&s;pecially in women newly delivered, variou&s;ly di&s;tributed in little circles.</P>
<P>The &s;maller and lower part of the womb, called its neck or cer|vix, abounds with callous rugae, or folds; in the inter&s;tices or &s;paces of which there are mucous &s;inu&s;es, and here and there round ve&s;icles full of a pellucid lymph, where it opens into the vagina, de&s;cribed below; it forms a round protuberance, not un|like the glans penis, called the os uteri, mouth of the womb, or os tincae, becau&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed, like a tench's mouth, divided by a rimae or chink; on which protuberance there is plenty of a mu|cous, glutinous liquor, furni&s;hed by numerous &s;inu&s;es there: this glutinous liquor &s;erves to &s;hut the os uteri in pregnancy.</P>
<P>The VAGINA, or canal of the uterus, is about &s;ix or &s;even inches long; it is &s;tretched from the mouth of the uterus to the pudendum, or external parts; it is of the &s;ame texture with the uterus; cellular, with numerous blood ve&s;&s;els interwoven: its inner &s;urface hath &s;everal rugae, or wrinkles; there are likewi&s;e
<PB N="52" REF="028021_0048_0FD6708190DFBB90">
nervous papillae &s;pread over it, which render it more &s;en&s;ible; its external orifice is &s;urrounded with mu&s;cular fibres, which con&s;trict it.</P>
<P>The uterus, as had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">id, is plentifully &s;tored with blood ve&s;&s;els; they are furni&s;hed from the hypoga&s;trics, by which, like|wi&s;e, the inner and greater part of the vagina is &s;upplied; its outer extremity is furni&s;hed from the external haemorrhoidal.</P>
<P>The womb is adapted for the retention of the embryo, and its nouri&s;hnent, till the time of birth; and with the ve&s;&s;els of the vagina, for affording the monthly evacuation called men&s;es, or catamenia.</P>
<P>But to the womb, for the purpo&s;e of promoting the generation of the human &s;pecies, there are united two other contrivances on each &s;ide, the one called tubae Fallopianae, Fallopian tubes, from the di&s;coverer, Fallopius; the other, ovaria, from their re|taining &s;mall round &s;ub&s;tances of the nature of eggs.</P>
<P>On each &s;ide of the fundus uteri the former open by two &s;mall orifices, which in a dead &s;ubject, with difficulty admit a hog's bri&s;tle; from this &s;mall opening each tube proceeds &s;omewhat tran&s;ver&s;ely from the fundus towards the lateral parts of the pel|vis, running between the duplicatures of the broad ligaments&mdash;their diameters gradually augmenting to their extremities, where they are about a quarter of an inch wide; they run not &s;traight from the womb, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut wind in &s;uch a manner as to turn their wide, open extremities towards the ovaria; the&s;e extremities are jagged or &s;collopped; their external membrane, or covering, is from the peritoneum; their proper coat is plentifully furni&s;hed with ve&s;&s;els; there are &s;ome ob&s;cure, &s;eemingly mu&s;cular, fibres inter&s;per&s;ed, &s;upported by a &s;pongy cellular texture.</P>
<P>The OVARIA are two whiti&s;h, oval, flat bodies, &s;ituated on the &s;ides of the fundus uteri, to which they are joined by a kind of &s;hort ligament, and inclo&s;ed, together with the tubae Fallo|pianae, in the duplicature of the broad ligament&mdash;their &s;ub&s;tance is cellular and clo&s;e, without fat&mdash;in it there are found, even in the ovaria of virgins, little round ve&s;icles, called ova, or eggs&mdash;of an uncertain number, commonly ten or twelve, full of a tran&s;|parent coagulable fluid. The&s;e ova adhere clo&s;ely to the texture of the ovaria.</P>
<P>The OVARIA and TUBAE Fallopianae, are &s;upplied with blood-ve&s;&s;els from the &s;permatics, which have nearly the &s;ame origin in females as in males&mdash;<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the arteries of the aorta, near the ri&s;e of the emulgents, and the veins from the vena cava, and emulgent vein; the&s;e ino&s;culate with the ve&s;&s;els that go to the uterus.</P>

<P>We might now, according to what we fir&s;t propo&s;ed re&s;pect|ing the nature of our &s;ubject, fini&s;h our anatomical account, as &s;ufficient has been de&s;cribed to give a tolerable idea of con&s;titu|tions in general; but as we al&s;o intend to &s;hew the methods of preventing, or &s;topping the progre&s;s of particular complaints, lo|cal as well as general&mdash;we mu&s;t, before we conclude, &s;peak of the te&s;tes, urethra, and penis, the male parts of generation&mdash;as they are &s;ubject to &s;ome complaints which require early atten|tion, by which &s;everal di&s;agreeable con&s;equences may be prevent|ed.</P>
<P>The TESTES, or TESTICLES, with regard to their &s;itu|ation, are &s;ufficiently known; they are defended from cold, and other injuries, by &s;everal membranes or coats.</P>
<P>The outer one is called the &s;crotum&mdash;which is made up of the epidermis, or &s;carf-&s;kin;&mdash;the &s;kin, and immediately under the latter, a thick cellular texture, clo&s;ely adhering to it, but with|out mu&s;cular fibres: next under this is what they call <HI>dartos,</HI> from its drawing up the &s;kin. This coat envelopes each te&s;tis &s;ingly; and by the junction of both together, where their &s;ides are contiguous, make a partition or &s;eptum between the two te&s;tes: it is likewi&s;e wholly cellular, without mu&s;cular fibres, and without fat. Under the dartos is the crema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er mu&s;cle, &s;o called from &s;u&s;pending the te&s;ticles; there is one to each, and ari&s;e from the tendon of the obliquus de&s;cendens, oblique de&s;cend|ing mu&s;cle of the lower belly; yet &s;ome fibres from the obliqu|us a&s;cendens, oblique a&s;cending mu&s;cle, the embracing the body of te&s;tes all around, &s;erve to rai&s;e it, and &s;queeze it in the act of generation. It is probable, that by the action of this mu&s;cle, that the &s;crotum is gathered up into rugae by cold, as neither it, nor the dartos, are furni&s;hed with mu&s;cular fibres. Under this mu&s;cle is another coat of a loo&s;e cellular texture, called vagina|lis, from forming, as it were, a kind of &s;heath to the te&s;tes, be|tween which and the innermo&s;t coat of all is a loo&s;e &s;pace, in &s;ome mea&s;ure like that between the heart and pericardium, where a watery humour is contained&mdash;the la&s;t and innermo&s;t coat is called, from its whitene&s;s, the albuginea; it is a thick, clo&s;e, &s;trong membrane, immediately contiguous to the kernel of the te&s;tes&punc;
<PB N="54" REF="028021_0050_0FD67084B07C52B0">
the &s;ub&s;tance of which kernelly part is of a white colour, and from rea&s;on and analogy, it is concluded to be a continuation of the evane&s;cent branches of the artery called &s;permatic, from its &s;upplying blood to the te&s;tes, from whence the &s;emen is &s;ecreted, rolled up together. It is divided into more than twenty portions or clu&s;ters, &s;eparated from one another by as many partitions, which are productions of the albuginea. Each clu&s;ter, contain|ed between two partitions, terminates in one duct; which ducts, above twenty in number, meeting together, form a kind of net|work adhering to the albuginea; every duct ana&s;tomo&s;ing with tho&s;e contiguous with it: from this duct ari&s;e ten or twelve o|ther di&s;tinct ducts, which being &s;eparated, bent, or folded in a wonderful manner, make as many va&s;cular cones, and by their uniting con&s;titute the head or beginning of the epididymis, or &s;mall te&s;ticle. This &s;ingle duct, variou&s;ly bent and folded into &s;erpentine windings, &s;uch as there is no in&s;tance of in any other part of the body, its windings being fa&s;tened together by cellu|lar texture, makes a roundi&s;h body on the upper and po&s;terior part of the te&s;ticle, called epididymis, which, at length, termi|nates in a firm and tough cylindrical tube, called vas deferens.</P>
<P>The PENIS con&s;i&s;ts of two bodies called corpora &s;pongio&s;a, or caverno&s;a, &s;pongy or cavernous bodies&mdash;part of the urethra, the glans or nut at its extremity, and its integuments. The integu|ments are, fir&s;t the &s;carf-&s;kin, and true &s;kin&mdash;which being folded back, and adhering round the root of the glans, forms what is called the praepuce, in the in&s;ide of which there are &s;mall glandu|lar folliculi, which &s;eparate an oily &s;ub&s;tance, &s;erving to make the praepuce &s;lip over the glans, and hinder them from growing together: this &s;ub&s;tance forms white flakes, and grows rancid and foetid by long &s;tagnation. In hot countries, it is more apt to corrupt and create inconveniences, than in temperate climates. This &s;eems to have introduced circumci&s;ion, which was early practi&s;ed all over the Ea&s;t, and made a part of the Jewi&s;h reli|gion. It is performed by cutting off the praepuce quite round, clo&s;e by the root of the glans.</P>
<P>Under this common integument, the penis hath a proper coat covering all its body, from the glans exclu&s;ive backwards and is of a tough tendinous texture.</P>
<P>The TWO CORPORA SPONGIOSA ari&s;e from the os pu|bis on each &s;ide, and are continued to the root of the glans: they are &s;o called, becau&s;e they are porous like &s;ponge, and capable of being enlarged by a fluid penetrating their &s;ub&s;tance, chiefly in the living, by blood&mdash;or in the dead &s;ubject, by mercury or inflation of air.</P>

<P>But we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that with re&s;pect to the term, irritability&mdash;it is by all authors equally applied to the nervous and va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, as well as mu&s;cular fibres, which we have &s;hewn it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to alter, and confine it to the two la&s;t alone&mdash;becau&s;e, in|dependent of the nerves, they cannot be put into motion without &s;ome material &s;timulus locally applied to them&mdash;whil&s;t the nerves may be brought into action by affections purely mental&mdash;the preci&s;e nature of who&s;e action we cannot de&s;cribe, and know them not but by effects.

<P>It was, therefore, unavoidable to &s;eparate the two&mdash;that con|&s;titutions might be preci&s;ely and di&s;tinctively marked, where the action of one or the other were mo&s;t prevalent, and hence great confu&s;ion prevented; add to this, it empowers us to account more rationally for &s;ympathetic affections, that is, where parts di&s;tant from others, &s;hew manife&s;t &s;igns of affection, though the cau&s;e producing them lies in &s;ome more di&s;tant part; or where affections are &s;uddenly produced in the habit, from &s;ome exter|nal appearances out of the habit, no matter being at that time inherent that occa&s;ions the&s;e affections from the locality of irrita|tion.

And the&s;e have been deduced from the different appearances of the con&s;titution&mdash;the various effects to which they were prone; the humours con&s;idered as inherent; and to the affections of particular parts, which they con&s;tantly, or on &s;light occa&s;ions, experience. But before any benefit can accrue in the application of remedies, or the manner pointed out by which mi&s;chief may be avoided from the &s;ame &s;ource, we &s;hould be acquainted with the corporeal con&s;truction and nature of their powers, which con&s;titutes mo&s;t of the&s;e deviations; and it is for want of this knowledge that &s;elf created phy&s;icians, <HI>doctors of imagination,</HI> oc|ca&s;ion very often a multiplicity of evils to their credulous patients, and to them&s;elves, under many morbid circum&s;tances&mdash;pre&s;crib|ing boldly the &s;ame applications to con&s;titutions diametrically oppo&s;ite to each other, and which require very different materials to conquer the &s;ame complaint.

<P>THE celebrated HOFFMAN, to who&s;e labours the art of phy&s;ic is much indebted for its improvement, &s;ays, <Q>A

By diaetetic is to be under&s;tood, tho&s;e materials which are taken from &s;uch things, as every body requires for the pre&s;ervation of health and life, and which are received in the &s;chools, under the denomination of non-naturals; for, ina&s;|much, as from a wrong or inordinate u&s;e of the&s;e, the fir&s;t foundations and proximate origin of di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;e, and al&s;o have their violence increa&s;ed; &s;o nothing is better adapted to expel or &s;ubdue morbid affections of various kinds, than a proper u&s;e of them, with a regular mode of living, for without that, nature can do no good in healing, nor medicine produce its de&s;ired effect. Whence the truth of GALEN's a&s;&s;ertion, That medicine has no efficacious remedy which can bring any permanent a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if the mode of living &s;hould re&s;i&s;t it, or &s;hould not act in conformity, and become an u&s;eful auxili|ary.</Q> And he &s;olemnly a&s;&s;erts, <Q>That by diaetetic remedies, (in which change of air and climate, proper exerci&s;e, well adapted meat and drink, al&s;o a prudent u&s;e of whey and mi|neral waters, with ab&s;tinence and ea&s;e are to be included,) he has performed &s;uch things in conquering ob&s;tinate chronic di&s;ea&s;es, which chiefly had their long and fixed &s;eat in the weakened &s;y&s;tem of the nerves, as &s;pa&s;modic, convul&s;ive, hypochondraic, and hy&s;teric affections, which others had in vain tried to accompli&s;h by medicines elegantly compounded, and judiciou&s;ly admini&s;tered, and he him&s;elf had expected from medicines of great fame.</Q></P>
<P>And certainly the doctrine is perfectly true&mdash;medicine can do very little in a variety of ca&s;es, without a &s;trict adherence to a well-adapted regimen&mdash;and in preventing the machine from be|ing afflicted with a diver&s;ity of maladies, nothing. The failure of all the arcana, &s;poken &s;o highly of by a number of the anci|ents, as to be called panaceas&mdash;nay, the hands of Gods&mdash;indeed, tho&s;e &s;upported by names of no le&s;s con&s;equence than FRIAR BACON, and LORD VERULAM, have proved how little de|pendence can be placed on the mo&s;t extolled no&s;trums&mdash;whil&s;t Carnaro, and &s;everal others of more modern date, have experi|mentally and inconte&s;tably proved what may be done in the&s;e points by a proper regimen, &s;elected with judgment, and per|&s;evered in with re&s;olution&mdash;not only curing different ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;es, which had re&s;i&s;ted the force of the art of medicine, in the hands of the mo&s;t well-informed and &s;agacious practitioners, but in&s;uring a continuance of health in a green old age.

However, as our bu&s;ine&s;s in this place is to give information on material things, we &s;hall refrain from verbal inve&s;tigation, as of little moment&mdash;and con&s;ider them in the following order&mdash;&s;hewing their mani|fe&s;t qualities, and explaining their perceptible effects.

2.

<P>If <HI>too cold</HI>&mdash;local inflammations&mdash;as quin&s;eys, pleuri&s;ies, perip|neumonies, are brought on by over di&s;tending the lungs from its gravity&mdash;increa&s;ing the tone of the ve&s;&s;els by con&s;tringing their fibres&mdash;conden&s;ing or thickening the humors&mdash;and le&s;&s;ening per|&s;piration.

<P>From the combination of &s;ome of the&s;e different qualities of the air, different affections found their origins.&mdash;Coldne&s;s and moi&s;ture are offen&s;ive, we find, to the con&s;titution&mdash;but heat, moi&s;|ture, and levity, are more pernicious, becau&s;e the&s;e, acting toge|ther, &s;upply the habit with a putre&s;cent tendency, from whence many of our mo&s;t dangerous complaints ari&s;e, as vomiting and purging of acrid bile, called cholera, bilious loo&s;ene&s;s, malignant fore-throats, and putrid fevers.</P>
<P N="5">5.

whatever; but the &s;ure&s;t mark of good air in any place, is from the longevity of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>The evident marks of a bad, or in&s;alubrious air in any hou&s;e, are dampne&s;&s;es, or di&s;colouring of plai&s;ter or wain&s;coat;&mdash;moul|dine&s;s of bread, wetne&s;s of &s;ponge, melting of &s;ugar, ru&s;ting of bra&s;s or iron, and rotting of furniture:&mdash;and nothing is more con|ducive to render air noxious, load it with putrid &s;teams, and breed bad di&s;tempers, than permitting common and crowded bu|rial places to be within the precinct, of populous cities; or num|bers of poor people living in uncleanline&s;s, collected together in &s;mall hou&s;es, or narrow &s;treets.</P>
<P>Valetudinarians experience the mo&s;t agreeable &s;en&s;ations when the wind is we&s;terly, though when at north, or north ea&s;t, it is accounted bracing and healthful. Indeed &s;o powerful an effect has the influence of the winds, agreeable to the quarters in which they were fixed, been &s;uppo&s;ed to have, that it has been a&s;&s;erted, our di&s;po&s;itions and tempers are greatly affected by them;&mdash;long continued ea&s;terly winds make people, who are naturally cheer|ful, very irritable and moro&s;e. Nor does our tempers being affected by the different &s;tates of air, &s;eem at all improbable, ina&s;much as the body and mind are linked together in &s;uch clo&s;e and intimate bonds of union, that they reciprocally affect each other: for as corporeal affections will, we know, alter the natu|ral di&s;po&s;itions of people&mdash;making the placid and &s;weet tempered, often petulant and peevi&s;h&mdash;the courageous, timid, fearful, and irre&s;olute&mdash;the mo&s;t patient, re&s;tle&s;s and unquiet&mdash;the lively and volatile, languid and de&s;ponding&mdash;and the mo&s;t active, indolent,&mdash;&s;o may the air, as it conduces to throw the con&s;titution into &s;tates nearly morbid, produce, in &s;ome degree, &s;imilar effects&mdash;as has been repeatedly experienced by men, not dive&s;ted of ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>A we&s;t wind, in general, is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t &s;alutary&mdash;then a north-we&s;t&mdash;after which &s;ucceeded, in degrees of &s;alubrity, in the following order&mdash;ea&s;t, north-ea&s;t, and la&s;t, &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t&mdash;and the&s;e may be accounted for, from the different qualities of the air, in proportion to the exce&s;s or deficiency of heat, cold|ne&s;s, moi&s;ture, dryne&s;s, weight, or levity&mdash;or the different noxi|ous or contrary combinations they bring along with them.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced, the &s;ituation of our habitations will be a very material con&s;ideration, in conducing to the pre&s;er|vation of our health.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t healthy expo&s;ure, we have been told, in any place fixed for re&s;idence, is to be found by cutting one of the trees near the place where the hou&s;e is to be built, tran&s;ver&s;ely with a &s;aw, then clo&s;ely to ob&s;erve the rings which appear on the &s;ur|face

of the &s;ection; the &s;ide of the tree on which the di&s;tance of the rings from each other is greate&s;t, is the mo&s;t healthful expo&s;ure. And this is obvious, becau&s;e there has been the greate&s;t accre|tion of matter by the healthful di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e parts &s;o made, from always being blown upon by air from the mo&s;t &s;alubrious quarter, which it faces, and being hid from that which comes from the oppo&s;ite, which &s;eems to produce a different effect&mdash;and it is an admitted fact, that in all places, or parts of country, where vegetation is mo&s;t vigorous, manife&s;ted by the &s;trength and richne&s;s of the vegetable cla&s;s; there will al&s;o animals enjoy the &s;ame con&s;equences&mdash;hence &s;hould the windows of the hou&s;e, all other circum&s;tances being the &s;ame have a &s;imilar a&s;pect.</P>

<P>The country is more healthy than cities, or large towns, which are populous, from the greater purity of the air, if they are in &s;imilar &s;ituations; but &s;ome countries are extremely unwhole|&s;ome, from the noxious vapours with which the air is impreg|nated&mdash;as tho&s;e near the mar&s;hes of E&s;&s;ex, fens of Cambridge-&s;hire, or contiguous to lead mines, and &s;melting hou&s;es; for in grounds clo&s;e to the&s;e two latter, animals which graze there are often de&s;troyed, and vegetation greatly impeded: indeed the miners, &s;melters, and people in the vicinity, are &s;ubject to the dry or convul&s;ive colic, and paralytic affections.</P>

<P>It is mo&s;t probable that our fir&s;t food was of the vegetable cla&s;s, in the &s;election of which, man was directed by experience, led to it from the &s;mell and ta&s;te; and the &s;upport and increa&s;e of &s;trength from thence con&s;equent, would confirm their u&s;e.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding food is required to repair tho&s;e particles which have been worn away, and di&s;&s;ipated by per&s;piration, &s;till a con&s;tant and quick repetition is al&s;o requi&s;ite; for the blood, from its own di&s;po&s;ition apt to run into the nature of lixivial &s;alts, continually approaches near to putri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nous acrimony, from

the circulatory motion and heat it perpetually &s;uffers, by which the animal humors are greatly di&s;po&s;ed to putrefaction.</P>
<P>But the blood al&s;o from per&s;pirable matter pa&s;&s;ing off, acquires a di&s;po&s;ition to coagulate, and the re&s;titution of the watery fluid; that its globules may be &s;eparated, and pre&s;erved in a &s;tate of &s;tu|pidity; and con&s;equently the re&s;t of the humors in a proper di&s;po&s;i|tion for &s;ecretion.</P>
<P>The&s;e truths are demon&s;trable, not only by their cau&s;es, but the appearance of men and animals, who die of hunger&mdash;for it is common for them to have an acrid, fetid, offen&s;ive breath; their teeth loo&s;ened by corro&s;ive &s;altne&s;s&mdash;violent pain in the &s;tomach&mdash;acute fevers, and delirium.</P>
<P>The nutritious part of the food, from animals, con&s;i&s;ts of a gelatinous lymph;&mdash;from vegetables of a farinaceous &s;ub&s;tance&mdash;in which is a portion of vegetable acid, oil, and &s;accharine or &s;ugary matter; con&s;equently, where the dige&s;tive powers are perfect, tho&s;e which abound mo&s;t with &s;uch matter in their re&s;|pective cla&s;&s;es, are the mo&s;t nutritious.</P>
<P>But animal lymph, or the fine&s;t or mo&s;t &s;ubtile part of the fluids, affords the quicke&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t nouri&s;hment, as it is nearly elaborated into juices &s;imilar to our own; vegetables <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o, as mo&s;t of the e&s;culent roots, plants, and fruits, are of an ace|&s;cent nature, few are alcale&s;cent, or replete with &s;timulant or aromatic particles; few are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of gelatinous lymph, and only are nutritious from their farina; not many changing into tho&s;e humors called indigenous, or natural, after having pa&s;&s;ed often through the cour&s;e of circulation.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding which, it would be extremely improper for men to live alone on animal food; le&s;t a habit &s;hould be induced too full of blood, and too replete with putre&s;cent juices; creat|ing ferocity, &s;curvy, faetor, lepro&s;y, and all kinds of lixivial cor|ruption; as in the ca&s;e among the anthropophagi, or tho&s;e who feed on human fle&s;h; all which mi&s;chiefs, by change of diet, and living &s;olely on vegetable food, are conquered.</P>
<P>Hence, in warm con&s;titutions, hot climates and &s;ea&s;ons of the year, men who are indi&s;po&s;ed, as well as tho&s;e in health, have a greater propen&s;ity to ace&s;cent vegetables, in proportion as the heat is more or le&s;s exce&s;&s;ive; and hence men in very hot coun|tries, commonly live on vegetables, &s;eldom or not without dan|ger, on animal diet; but in cold countries, the practice is &s;afer, and more free from inconveniences: for this rea&s;on, bread, or farinous &s;ub&s;tances analogous to bread, is univer&s;ally made u&s;e of; but we &s;hould ob&s;erve, that vegetable food, be&s;ides its ace&s;cent property, is replete with fixed air.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid of the nature of aliment, the utility of mixed diet, vegetable, and animal, will be obvious; as they

<HEAD>3. EXERCISE and REST.</HEAD>
<P>And when we &s;peak of exerci&s;e, we include that of the mind, with the body; for the&s;e two are &s;o intimately connected, that they produce a variety of effects one on the other.</P>
<P>To exerci&s;e, the ancients have, as well as the moderns, indeed ever attributed great utility, particularly in pur&s;uing it with pro|priety, and have allowed, that great con&s;titutional mi&s;chief may be derived from its abu&s;e or neglect.</P>
<P>It has with great ju&s;tice been con&s;idered the &s;ole in&s;trument of the cure of many di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the glandular &s;y&s;|tem; and SYDENHAM had &s;o high an opinion of it, particu|larly riding on hor&s;eback, that he affirms, <Q>Mercury for the lues venerea, nor the bark for intermittents, are not more certain &s;pecifics, than riding on hor&s;eback for a con&s;umption;</Q> though here he &s;eems to be &s;anguine in his opinion, and has given too great latitude to the &s;alutary effects of this remedy; for, certain|ly there are ca&s;es of con&s;umption where riding becomes injurious&mdash;but the con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject belongs not to this place&mdash;we &s;hall &s;peak more minutely of it, when we come to give particular directions on that complaint.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in local motion of the body, and that motion more powerful of the limbs.

<P>REST is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to relieve both the mind and body &s;uch as is &s;ufficient to free the ve&s;&s;els from the &s;tronger exertions of their ela&s;tic force, recruit their &s;trength, and &s;et thinking facul|ties at re&s;t from their labour.

<P>There are innumerable in&s;tances of fear creating a &s;udden and powerful action of the bowels and urinary pa&s;&s;ages. <HI>Fright</HI> has put off a fit of an intermittent, when all remedies had failed; a pi&s;tol fired in the chamber of James the Fir&s;t had this effect, oc|ca&s;ioning al&s;o a &s;udden action of the inte&s;tinal canal downwards; it has al&s;o given ri&s;e to an indi&s;&s;oluble tumor in a woman's brea&s;t; <HI>exce&s;s of joy</HI> has cau&s;ed fainting and &s;tupor; <HI>anger,</HI> induc|ed apoplexy and phrenzy.</P>

<P>But as di&s;qui&s;itions of this &s;ort would lead us more into the field of &s;peculative curio&s;ity, than practical utility, I &s;hall con|tent my&s;elf with taking a quotation or two from a judicious wri|ter on this &s;ubject&mdash;and from thence make the application to a&s;|certain the propriety of the divi&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q>Fear, grief, and tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which partake of them&mdash;as envy, hatred, malice, revenge, and de&s;pair, are known by ex|perience to weaken the nerves; retard the circular motion of the fluids; hinder per&s;piration; impair dige&s;tion; and often to produce &s;pa&s;ms, ob&s;tructions, and hypochondriacal di&s;or|ders; and extreme terror has &s;ometimes brought on death.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e I term&mdash;<HI>&s;aturnine</HI> or <HI>&s;edative</HI>&mdash;becau&s;e they affect the nervous &s;y&s;tem in &s;uch a manner, as to impede its influence in general&mdash;con&s;equently, the action of all tho&s;e parts that are de|pendent upon it, and where any of them &s;eem to act &s;upernatu|rally, that action is occa&s;ioned more by irritability, or pre-di&s;|po&s;ition of the part, than from any other cau&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>Moderate joy or anger, on the other hand, and tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and affections of the mind, which partake of their nature&mdash;as cheerfulne&s;s, contentment, hope, virtuous and mutual love, and courage in doing good, invigorate the nerves, accelerate the circulating fluids, promote per&s;piration, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts dige&s;|tion:&mdash;but violent anger, which differs from madne&s;s only in duration, creates bilious, inflammatory, convul&s;ive, and &s;ome|times apoplectic di&s;orders, e&s;pecially in hot temperaments&mdash;and exce&s;s of joy de&s;troys &s;leep, and often has fatal and &s;ud|den effects.</Q></P>

<P>Hence, though we cannot influence the mind in the particular manner we wi&s;h always, we &s;hould endeavour to rai&s;e &s;uch &s;en&s;a|tions,

<P>It is indeed a melancholy con&s;ideration to reflect, that, though health is the only foundation of all plea&s;ure, and may, by ea&s;y methods, be pre&s;erved, men &s;hould neglect the&s;e means, which would enable them to pur&s;ue their darling Godde&s;s through all her varied &s;cenes of rational delight; but &s;o it is, for notwith|&s;tanding innumerable authors have written profe&s;&s;edly on the dioetetic regimen, from the unwillingne&s;s valetudinarians have in complying with rules, which lay a re&s;traint upon the gratifi|cation of their appetites, though calculated to pre&s;erve health, it has been too much neglected.</P>
<P><HI>Election treats, Pari&s;h dinners, Se&s;&s;ion and City Fea&s;ts, and free luxurious indulgence,</HI> have numbered many with the dead, which proper ab&s;tinence might have pre&s;erved.

<P>In WINE, the effects are almo&s;t never &s;o rapid, on account of their dilute &s;tate, and &s;mall do&s;es in which the alchohol is throws in; on which account it proves only more &s;timulant and exhili|rating&mdash;it may produce &s;tupor, but as it is apt to be rejected by the &s;tomach, and by other matters with which it is mixed, the powers of alchohol is moderated.</P>

<P>But combined with wine, the&s;e qualities are more innocent; as the action of mu&s;t, alchohol, and vinegar, &s;eparately may pre|vent each other's &s;imple and deleterious effects; and al&s;o the wa|ter may, in the proportion in which it is mixed, have its efficacy in weakening the properties of the other component parts.</P>
<P>CYDER and PERRY may be con&s;idered as having the &s;ame properties, though in much le&s;s degree than wine, with regard to their &s;timulant and &s;edative effects; but are more replete with ace&s;cency&mdash;generate too great degrees of flatulency, run quicker into the acetous fermentation, and produce unea&s;y gripings, and more painful &s;en&s;ations of the bowels, be&s;ides being more pro|ductive of calculous complaints, and the convul&s;ive colic; or dry belly-ach, terminating often in pal&s;y.</P>
<P>From this review we can ea&s;ily judge of the effects, whether advantageous or otherwi&s;e, which are likely to en&s;ue from wine, and al&s;o from the different compo&s;itions &s;old by our retail ven|ders and wine merchants, under that title; which produce di&s;|agreeable con&s;equences to tho&s;e who drink freely of it&mdash;laying the foundation for a variety of dangerous, lingering, and fatal complaints.

Now compounds like the&s;e mu&s;t be replete with tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs which we have enumerated under <HI>mu&s;t</HI> and <HI>vinegar</HI>&mdash;and others brought on by the &s;edative a&s;tringent powers, occa&s;i|oned by preparations of lead&mdash;rendering the action of the &s;to|mach and inte&s;tines torpid, relaxing the&s;e organs, ob&s;tructing the exit of materials which ought to be thrown out of the body&mdash;filling the machine full of crude and acid humors&mdash;contaminat|ing the whole ma&s;s of fluid&mdash;and preventing dige&s;tion, that pa|rent of almo&s;t all chronic di&s;ea&s;es. When we, therefore, &s;peak of wine, we would not be under&s;tood to mean the&s;e baneful com|pounds; but that which is pure, as can be imported, which MACKENZIE &s;ays, <Q>is an admirable liquor, and, u&s;ed in mo|derate quantity, an&s;wers many purpo&s;es of health; and beer, well brewed, light, of a proper &s;trength and age, if we except water and wine, is, perhaps, the mo&s;t ancient and be&s;t &s;ort of drink in common u&s;e among mankind.</Q></P>
<P>But with re&s;pect to wine we may carry the matter further, for it is generally allowed to be the mo&s;t agreeable and powerful cordial we can have recour&s;e to in the la&s;t &s;tage of &s;ome fevers, completing of it&s;elf the cure. In low nervous, and putrid fevers, it is beneficial throughout&mdash;when there appear &s;ymptoms of great debility&mdash;and it may be very often taken in large quantity, where the moving powers of the &s;y&s;tem abate much of their &s;alutary action, and the fluids &s;eem to be running rapidly into a &s;tate of putre&s;cency.</P>
<P>How much, therefore, is it to be lamented, that we &s;hould be deprived of &s;o valuable a liquor&mdash;replete with &s;o many u&s;eful properties by the avarice of a &s;et of beings, who are &s;uffered to impo&s;e upon, and injure the public with impunity, and ama&s;s fortunes, by &s;elling poi&s;ons for our de&s;truction, in&s;tead of wine for our pre&s;ervation and recovery of our health.

<P>They are &s;ubject to many inconveniences, chiefly from the ra|pidity of the blood's motion; hence are liable to fall into violent continued fevers, and inflammatory di&s;orders.

They &s;hould have recour&s;e to occa&s;ional bleeding, when the head feels loaded, giddy, or when they are drow&s;y, and prone to &s;leep, or &s;ymptoms of general fullne&s;s are prevalent, but not u&s;e in un|nece&s;&s;arily, or too frequently, and empty the habit now and then by purgatives; they &s;hould drink diluting liquors, as water, or &s;uch where that is &s;uperabundant; in general be &s;paring of ani|mal food, and rather eat freely of vegetable diet, for the&s;e are apt to be plethoric, or loaded with too great a proportion of &s;an|guinary ma&s;s: for &s;uch, a moderate, warm, and moi&s;t atmo&s;|phere is the mo&s;t eligible &s;ituation; in fine, nothing &s;hould be allowed them that will increa&s;e too powerfully the action of the living &s;olids, or occa&s;ion too great an increa&s;e of the fluids.

<HEAD>2. The &s;trong, robu&s;t, and torpid.</HEAD>
<P>Where, though the &s;tamina are firm in too great a proportion there is a defect of irritability the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem being in too torpid a &s;tate. The&s;e require not any particular attention, as from the want of proper &s;en&s;ibility they will not be expo&s;ed to feel particular changes ari&s;ing from common cau&s;es, or &s;uch as would effect tho&s;e which are more irritable. The&s;e con&s;titutions bear all evacuations well, as they are not apt ea&s;ily to have their &s;olids too much relaxed, but are rather prone to become ple|thoric, from indulgence, which they are apt to run into, from not feeling tho&s;e effects, which people of different habits &s;o fre|quently experience. They &s;hould endeavour to prevent an over|fulne&s;s either by ab&s;tinence, or proper evacuations, which they bear in general without inconvenience, though bleeding in the&s;e is le&s;s advi&s;eable than purging, owing to the torpid &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem; and, which, being neglected, &s;hould a plethora be the con&s;equence, &s;ome of the internal parts of the habit, as the brains, lungs, &amp;c. might be affected by dangerous, or at lea&s;t trouble|&s;ome oppre&s;&s;ions, and we very often find men of this Con&s;tituti|on for want of timely care, and from indi&s;cretions, afflicted with &s;udden vertigos or giddine&s;s of the head, coughing, or &s;pitting of blood, apoplexy, &amp;c. and the&s;e are &s;ometimes of a cold habit, though plethoric, and apt to fall into hypochondriac affections from vi&s;ceral accumulations, and languid circulation.</P>

<HEAD>3. The &s;trong, robu&s;t, and incitable.</HEAD>
<P>This Con&s;titution &s;ometimes, though more rarely occurs, and when it does, it generally is united with va&s;cular torpidity. In this there is too great incitability of the nervous &s;y&s;tem; and men of this habit are &s;ubject to a mixture of hy&s;teric, and hypo|chondriac di&s;ea&s;es; ira&s;cible at trifles, de&s;ponding nearly approach|ing to melancholy, they are apt to be afflicted with various &s;pa&s;|modic affections, particularly of the throat, inte&s;tines, and &s;to|mach; &s;ometimes make profu&s;e quantities of pale, limpid water; at others, &s;mall, but turbid and high coloured; they are fre|quently tormented with flatulence, and perplexed with whim&s;i|cal and incon&s;i&s;tent ideas; the extremities are generally cold, and moving from place to place, or any motion almo&s;t is performed with languor&mdash;mo&s;t of the evacuations are le&s;&s;ened, or irregular|ly performed; &s;leep is imperfect, they are troubled with fright|ful dreams, and are &s;ubject to the incubus, or what is called the night-mare, and all the&s;e are derived from the &s;ame con&s;titutional &s;ources, when torpor attends; for from the want of due power of the mu&s;cular fibres, the circulation of the blood is not carried on with full freedom to the extremities, the internal parts con|&s;equently
<PB N="92" REF="028021_0088_0FD670ABC1DF37B0">
are loaded, hence in tho&s;e parts there is an additional fullne&s;s and &s;timulus, for the &s;timulus is always in proportion to the quantity of blood flowing to a part or collected in it, from the evolution of the heat, and the &s;uperabundance of acrimony, for the fluids of the&s;e con&s;titutions generally abound with acri|mony, particularly &s;uch as is productive of the nettle-ra&s;h; hence, then, the internal parts become more &s;en&s;ible to the nervous in|fluence, con&s;equently &s;olicits it the more freely; and hence ari&s;es the appearances above enumerated.</P>
<P>In the&s;e habits&mdash;frictions on the extremities, warm cloathing, warm bath, riding on hor&s;eback, are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary; gene|rous diet, wine, &s;timulating vegetables &s;hould be adhered to, food of ea&s;y dige&s;tion, the mind &s;hould be kept perfectly at ea&s;e, cheerful company, change of &s;cene, and &s;uch amu&s;ements as di|vert the attention, produce a moderate degree of mental hilarity, &s;hould be procured; and as for medicines, they &s;hould be &s;uch, as at the &s;ame time, that they allay the incitable power of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, diffu&s;e a general warmth through the habit, and the&s;e given occa&s;ionally, as a&s;afoetida, mu&s;k, vitriolic, aether, cam|phor, but all opiates mu&s;t be avoided, becau&s;e they are apt to render the mu&s;cular fibres too torpid&mdash;in general chalybeates may be per&s;i&s;ted in, and Bath waters &s;hould be recommended.</P>
<P>But where in&s;tead of torpor, va&s;cular irritability is a conco|mitant, be&s;ides being &s;ubject to inflammatory complaints, and continued febrile affections from &s;light cau&s;es, they are &s;ubject to permanent &s;pa&s;modic affections, &s;uch as tho&s;e which are denomi|nated by medical men, tetanic complaints, where, when &s;pa&s;ms ari&s;e, the mu&s;cular fibres remain in a fixed &s;tate, not contracting and relaxing alternately, nor fugitive as in common convul&s;ions: the&s;e are liable to be &s;eized with a locked jaw, and continued mu&s;cular rigidity. In the&s;e con&s;titutions, warm baths are pecu|liarly u&s;eful, gentle and con&s;tant exerci&s;e, cooling diet, and co|pious dilution with aqueous liquids, thin ace&s;cent wines, milk and vegetable diet, evacuations of all kinds &s;hould be con&s;tantly and moderately produced, particularly per&s;piration, and the body &s;hould never be co&s;tive; I have &s;aid moderately, becau&s;e in en|deavouring to abate the irritability of the &s;y&s;tem, we mu&s;t be careful not to increa&s;e the incitability, which is apt to be the ca&s;e, from evacuations too copious. Opiates are in the&s;e habits extremely u&s;eful, and may be freely given under particular cir|cum&s;tances. With regard to regimen, what we have &s;aid before in the beginning of this &s;ection may be adhered to, taking e&s;pecial care to avoid all mental unea&s;ine&s;s. The&s;e con&s;titutions are apt to be plethoric and attended with heat.</P>
<P>What we have delivered appertains to tho&s;e who are con&s;idered
<PB N="93" REF="028021_0089_0FD67075592560C0">
to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;trong degrees of mu&s;cular firmne&s;s, differently com|bined. We mu&s;t now proceed to &s;uch as have a WEAK, RE|LAXED, DELICATE HABIT, JOINED WITH TOO GREAT INCITABILITY. And this circum&s;tance generally occurs in the&s;e habits, that they have al&s;o too great a &s;hare of ir|ritability. The&s;e are &s;ubject to painful and &s;pa&s;modic di&s;ea&s;es; and the more delicate &s;ex of this con&s;titution are prone to hy&s;te|ric affections from the relaxation and irritability of their habits. They al&s;o are con&s;tantly a tacked on every &s;light cold, with &s;low fevers, and have their dige&s;tive powers loaded with faburra, or different kinds of ill dige&s;ted matters in the &s;tomach and bowels, making their way into the habit in this noxious form.</P>
<P>To the&s;e, a dry, clear air is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, moderate ex|erci&s;e, particularly riding, cold bathing, and chalybeate waters; animal food ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, and free from fat, and a temperate u&s;e of a&s;tringent wines. Vegetables &s;hould be admini&s;tered &s;par|ingly, and tho&s;e of the le&s;s flatulent kinds; food and liquids, vi&s;cid and tenacious, &s;uch as flour puddings, potatoes, oy&s;ters, &s;trong &s;oups, and malt liquors, ought to be prohibited. Every thing calculated to &s;trengthen the tone of the &s;y&s;tem, and pre&s;erve it in an equable &s;tate ought to be had recour&s;e to, and all things likely to weaken it mu&s;t be de&s;i&s;ted from. Cheerful company and moderate amu&s;ements are &s;erviceable, but pur&s;ued too freely, the rever&s;e; for all fatigues, both of body and mind, are pre|judical&mdash;the cu&s;tom of taking vegetable acids too copiou&s;ly is al&s;o pernicious&mdash;hot tea, or any thing drank too warm&mdash;for the&s;e all contribute to relax and load the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, with foul, vi&s;cid materials, which produce therein internal &s;timulus, create flatulence, and communicate general irritability through the &s;y&s;tem. Blood &s;hould never be taken from people of this ha|bit, but upon the mo&s;t urgent occa&s;ions, and then only &s;paringly, in which cupping is preferable to the lancet; and it is &s;afer to take it away at two operations, than at one, &s;ome little di&s;tance of time from each other, if more than &s;ix ounces &s;hould be re|quired. All &s;udden changes &s;hould be avoided with the utmo&s;t caution, either with re&s;pect to cloathing or diet, the mind kept free from anxious cares&mdash;hence watering places are u&s;eful, where tho&s;e impregnated with chalybeate particles, or iron, may be drank; in fine, every thing ought to be advi&s;ed, which, in a mo|derate degree, can exhilirate the &s;pirits, and contribute to give &s;trength to the &s;olids. The&s;e con&s;titutions are generally warm, &s;ubject to irregular flu&s;hing heats, and have for the mo&s;t part no &s;mall degree of acrimony in the habit. But there are &s;ome who po&s;&s;e&s;s too great a &s;hare of torpidity, and then they form that kind.</P>

and other incentives, that &s;timulate the appetite, and occa&s;ion men to overload, and weaken the tone of the &s;tomach, and dige&s;|tive powers, have rendered this malady infinitely more mild in its paroxy&s;ms.

<P>Various modes have been recommended for preventing the acce&s;&s;ions of the gout&mdash;but what &s;eems to have gained credit from the experience of &s;everal intelligent men, is the u&s;e of &s;ul|phur; of which a drink is made by impregnating water with a proper proportion of it, and this has proved &s;alutary, in not on|ly mitigating fits of the gout, but &s;ome &s;ay of totally preventing their return.

<P>The SECOND&mdash;the <HI>poi&s;on of the viper.</HI>&mdash;The ill con&s;equences generally attending the bite of vipers, by which means they pour their virus into the wound, and &s;o communicate it to the habit, have been prevented, it has been a&s;&s;erted, by the immediate ap|plication of the fat of that reptile to the wounded part.&mdash;It was, in the more early periods, con&s;idered as a &s;pecific in that ca&s;e&mdash;but olive oil has been known to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e full as effect|ually.&mdash;The&s;e means may al&s;o be u&s;eful in abating the pain origi|nating from the &s;tings of <HI>wa&s;ps&mdash;bees&mdash;bugs&mdash;gnats</HI>&mdash;or prevent|ing the effects from burns, or &s;calds, before the &s;kin is rai&s;ed into bli&s;ters; but the more effectual modes are the immediate appli|cation of &s;pirits of hart&s;horn, or of &s;al ammoniac, or &s;pirit of wine, and continued &s;ome time.</P>

But unfor|tunately, men under the&s;e circum&s;tances often plunge them&s;elves into the oppo&s;ite extremes, by imprudencies and indulgencies; for it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of health is not far di&s;tant from di&s;ea&s;e, and very often trifling indi&s;cretions lay the foundation for great mi&s;chief, if the con&s;equences occur|ing from thence are not &s;oon put a &s;top to; which, indeed, by a little care and attention, might frequently be prevented;&mdash;cer|tain rules for which we &s;hall endeavour to point out, which one would &s;carce think nece&s;&s;ary, if we con&s;ider the latitude given by CELSUS, to tho&s;e in health, did not experience every day con|vince us, that the documents he lays down require &s;ome re&s;tric|tions.&mdash;He &s;ays, <Q>A man, who is healthful, and at his own di&s;|po&s;al, ought not to be confined to any particular regimen; as he wants not the advice of a phy&s;ician, his mode of life &s;hould be varied;&mdash;he &s;hould &s;ometimes re&s;ide in the country &s;ome|times in cities, but oftener in the former;&mdash;he &s;hould now and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ail, hunt, or live at ea&s;e, in perfect re&s;t;&mdash;he &s;hould u&s;e &s;ometimes the warm bath, &s;ometimes the cold;&mdash;eat, in common, all kinds of food;&mdash;&s;ometimes be in company, and fea&s;t him&s;elf; &s;ometimes live retired, and ab&s;temiou&s;ly; <HI>now and then take more or le&s;s nutriment than might be exactly pro|per;</HI> but refre&s;h him&s;elf rather twice with diet, than once a day, and <HI>that in a plentiful portion, if it can be concocted;</HI>&mdash;but though exerci&s;e and food in this mode are nece&s;&s;ary, in inordi|nate

degrees they are not &s;erviceable; for bu&s;ine&s;s, preventing the exerci&s;e, which may happen on account of attendance in various avocations, the body will be injured, as tho&s;e which receive nouri&s;hment in their u&s;ual way, will quickly decay and become di&s;ordered.</Q></P>
<P>Though this latitude is given, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve it is only to a man in full vigour of health; but even here, during the &s;tate of allowed indulgence, &s;ome caution becomes nece&s;&s;ary, e&s;pecially again&s;t every &s;pecies of exce&s;s; for it is a known and allowed truth, that exce&s;s of every kind, whether corporeal or mental, di&s;orders he human frame, and lays the foundation for a variety of complaints, even in tho&s;e things, a moderate &s;hare of which is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of our machines&mdash;conduces to invi|gorate our mental powers, and promote our plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In <HI>eating</HI> and <HI>drinking,</HI> this is an obvious truth, though in the latter it is much &s;afer to exceed than the former; in proof of which, let us examine them.</P>
<P>We find that by drinking a quantity of vinous and &s;pirituous liquor, in which all tho&s;e which cau&s;e inebriation are included; the vital principles, or that which &s;upports life, and renders the machine active, is rendered extremely powerful by the &s;timulus applied partially to the &s;tomach, or more diffu&s;ively; the &s;pirits are elevated, &s;ometimes even to madne&s;s; a more than common &s;tre&s;s is laid upon the con&s;titution; the habit becomes fuller &s;o long as this &s;timulus continues, and liquor is poured into the &s;to|mach; which &s;timulus cea&s;ing from con&s;titutional fatigue, the &s;y&s;tem feels too much loaded and enervated; the &s;tomach relax|ed, and all the vital powers incapacitated to perform their func|tions properly; hence pain, &s;ickne&s;s, head-ach, languor, or a tem|porary fever, perhaps after a debauch, the whole, or mo&s;t part of the&s;e inconveniencies are experienced.</P>
<P>To remedy which, lying in bed and plentiful dilution with watery liquors&mdash;as weak tea&mdash;&s;mall broth&mdash;thin gruel, &amp;c. &s;hould be per&s;i&s;ted in, to promote per&s;piration; or recour&s;e &s;hould be had to riding on hor&s;eback, by which means the &s;uperabundant load will be carried off, and the body re&s;tored to its proper tone. Either of the&s;e methods may be pur&s;ued, as is mo&s;t agreeable to the con&s;titution: the former I &s;hould recommend to plethoric habits, and tho&s;e of a &s;trong &s;tamina; the latter to the more re|laxed who&s;e &s;tomach is generally in a weaker &s;tate. Sometimes taking plentifully of the following:&mdash;One dram and a half of &s;alt of tartar, called now prepared kali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> four table &s;poonfuls or five of lemon juice water which has been boiled, half a pint&mdash;brandy three or four table &s;poonfuls, and this &s;weetened with &s;ugar; or if the &s;tomach is very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, a dram and a half of aro|matic
<PB N="106" REF="028021_0102_0FD627DDAD70A8F0">
confection, or two table &s;poonfuls of tincture of bark may be added;&mdash;a tea cup or more of which may be taken often in the day;&mdash;or what is better, the &s;alt of tartar may be di&s;&s;olved in the liquid, without the lemon juice; and after every &s;ix &s;poonfuls drank, let a table &s;poonful of lemon juice be taken, and this repeated in the &s;ame manner;&mdash;or &s;ome warm and grateful cordial, as ratifia&mdash;u&s;quebaugh&mdash;brandy, mixed with peppermint water, may be admini&s;tered, which will give immediate relief to tho&s;e who&s;e &s;tomach is affected with nau&s;ea, &s;ickne&s;s, or oppre&s;|&s;ion, a common practice with men devoted to liquor; but this &s;hould be had recour&s;e to only on very particular occa&s;ions, for it is a cu&s;tom may be attended with di&s;agreeable con&s;equences, if too frequently u&s;ed, becau&s;e the &s;tomach, once accu&s;tomed to any particular &s;timulus, requires the con&s;tant repetition of that &s;ti|mulus, which, in time, de&s;troys its tone, and lays the foundation for tho&s;e maladies which ari&s;e from inebriation; and it is this which often induce men to turn drunkards; low &s;pirited women, frequently from taking things of this fort to exhilirate their &s;pi|rits, are converted into &s;hamele&s;s &s;ots, and become the di&s;grace of their own &s;ex, and contempt of ours. However, this furni&s;h|es one proof of the power which the &s;tomach contains over the &s;y&s;tem in general; as by the &s;tomach being &s;timulated, all that la&s;&s;itude&mdash;languor&mdash;nau&s;ea&mdash;&s;ickne&s;s&mdash;and every unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation attendant on its relaxation, are removed, except heat.</P>
<P><HI>By exce&s;s in eating,</HI> the &s;tomach is apt to be over-di&s;tended&mdash;the dige&s;tive powers weakened&mdash;the ve&s;&s;els filled with crude chyle&mdash;re&s;piration retarded; hence a &s;en&s;e of weight at the &s;to|mach&mdash;pain and flatulence&mdash;propen&s;ity to &s;leep&mdash;inactivity, and fullne&s;s of the head&mdash;ob&s;tructed vi&s;cera&mdash;jaundice&mdash;drop&s;y&mdash;a&s;thma&mdash;apoplexy&mdash;and a number of chronic complaints, if the practice is continued.</P>
<P>But if an error has been committed, and e&s;pecially if that has been with high-&s;ea&s;oned di&s;hes, a draught of cold water, acidu|lated with elixir of vitriol, taken &s;oon after eating, will relieve the &s;tomach from that weight with which it is often oppre&s;&s;ed, a&s;&s;i&s;t dige&s;tion, re&s;train fermentation, and prevent flatulency; from hence, perhaps, the u&s;e of ices may be approved.</P>
<P>I remember an account given me of a dignified clergyman, who was &s;o great a &s;lave to his appetite, that he was obliged con|&s;tantly to have recour&s;e to &s;ome application to prevent indige&s;|tion, he gormandized &s;o abominably; as a proof of his gluttony, I cannot give it a gentler term, the following is recited of him: He was invited to dinner, where every rarity the place afforded, was provided, of which he eat in his u&s;ual manner; but the gen|tleman, with whom he dined, knowing he was extremely fond

of veni&s;on, and being well acquainted with his di&s;po&s;ition, re|&s;erved the haunch in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, of which he had adverti&s;ed he re&s;t of the company; on its appearance, the already &s;atiated di|vine, after expre&s;&s;ing his &s;urpri&s;e a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> not being informed of this luxury before, retreated into the yard, di&s;gorged the load he had before &s;wallowed, and returned to the attack of the veni&s;on, with his accu&s;tomed vigor and prowe&s;s, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of his companions. Hence we may infer, vomits in many ca&s;es are al|&s;o &s;erviceable; however, at an early period, he became the victim of di&s;ea&s;e, and died of a drop&s;y, &s;ucceeding an irremediable jaun|dice, brought on from this cour&s;e of living.</P>
<P>With regard to our food, however, in quantity and quality, it &s;hould be properly proportioned to our exerci&s;e. The farmer, who follows his plow, and is perpetually toiling from morning till night, could not exi&s;t on food appropriated to tho&s;e who pur|&s;ue not the &s;everer exerci&s;e of the body; his diet mu&s;t be of the coar&s;er kind, &s;uch as old milk chee&s;e, &s;alted meats, bread made of rye, potatoes, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the&s;e in pretty large quantities. This food an&s;wers to him the purpo&s;es of nature, keeps his body in a &s;tate of health, becau&s;e his dige&s;tive powers are very active, and form from the&s;e materials good chyle, on account of the occupation in which he is engaged; which in the more delicate and le&s;s laborious, or indolent, would occa&s;ion great indi&s;po&s;ition. In Hereford&s;hire, and &s;ome other counties, men are not allowed fit for &s;ervice, nor get hired, without, as it is termed, they can bolt bacon; that is, &s;wallow it unma&s;ticated, cut into pieces, a|bout an inch and an half, or two inches long, and half an inch &s;quare, or thereabouts, and this in tolerable quantities; and this is done in order that they may attend clo&s;ely to their labour, without &s;pending any time in taking in nouri&s;hment for their nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport; for bacon being fat, and of a firm texture, from being hardened by &s;alt in its curing, will lie a long time in an undige&s;ted &s;tate, by which means the cravings of the appetite are kept off, and the &s;trength &s;upported.</P>
<P>But &s;hould ab&s;tinence he unavoidable, a man, during that pe|riod, &s;hould not undertake any laborious employment: as in that ca&s;e, the con&s;umption of the thinner fluids would be too great, the &s;olids would be rendered weak for want of proper &s;upport, and the liquids di&s;po&s;ed either to form concretions, that is, dege|nerate into too thick ma&s;&s;es, or run into a &s;tate of putre&s;cent a|crimony.</P>
<P>There is one cu&s;tom to which the generality of mankind are apt to be addicted; when they have &s;uffered fatigue, and that perhaps &s;evere, from hunting, &s;hooting, cricket playing, walking, &amp;c. they commonly indulge their appetites by eating copiou&s;ly
<PB N="108" REF="028021_0104_0FD670B2ECEFB538">
of &s;olid food; and think it one of the benefits from thence ari&s;|ing, that they are enabled to throw down &s;uch a load of gro&s;s materials; nay, not content with this, they make them float in porter, ale, or &s;ome other vi&s;cid liquor, and afterwards indulge them&s;elves with a jolly bottle; and this they think &s;upported by rea&s;on, for where the machine is weakened, it &s;eems natural to &s;uppo&s;e it requires much refre&s;hment. If we examine the effects of &s;uch indi&s;creet conduct, we cannot he&s;itate to pronounce it erroneous, and condemn the practice: for after eating and drink|ing, in this manner, they grow dull and heavy; and general la&s;|&s;itude comes on; the pul&s;e grows quick; the face flu&s;hes; a tem|porary fever &s;ucceeds; &s;leep is di&s;turbed; profu&s;e &s;weats break out or a too great general heat, with dryne&s;s of the &s;kin, is per|ceptible; the mouth is clammy; thir&s;t is an attendant; and they ri&s;e in the morning weary, and afflicted with pain, or &s;tiffne&s;s in the joints, wanting that alacrity and activity they ought to po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> on the night's indulgence.

<P>Therefore, if a man has laboured under &s;evere hunger, his &s;to|mach will be in a &s;tate of contractility, le&s;&s;ened in its capacity more than u&s;ual; loading it con&s;equently too heavily, will either occa&s;ion vomiting, or unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation of weight: heart-burn, perhaps inflammation, or a &s;pa&s;m of both the orifices, or either of them&mdash;or mi&s;chief might be created in other parts of the machine, from filling the ve&s;&s;els, which mu&s;t al&s;o be in too contractile a &s;tate, too full of crude ill formed chyle; for in this &s;ituation, nei|ther the peculiar juices of the liver&mdash;&s;weet-bread&mdash;nor tho&s;e of the &s;tomach it&s;elf, can be &s;eparated in their proper quantity, nor will be endowed with their natural qualities, &s;ufficiently perfect|ed for the bu&s;ine&s;s of dige&s;tion&mdash;all which are ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for forming the nutritious fluid in a &s;alutary &s;tate.</P>
<P>And what on the contrary will happen, if a man, after full feeding, filling the habit copiou&s;ly and con&s;tantly with liquids, &s;hould &s;ubmit to ab&s;olute fa&s;ting?</P>
<P>As it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep up a plenitiude in the ve&s;&s;els, that the fluids may pre&s;erve their power of reaction, as a &s;timulus a&s;&s;i&s;ting powerfully the promotion of va&s;cular contraction, and thus maintaining an ea&s;y and equable circulation, we from time to time throw in food to &s;upply the defect of the fluids, which ari&s;es from the con&s;tant and natural action of the ve&s;&s;els; and this not only con&s;titues a requi&s;ite equilibrium, or nece&s;&s;ary e|quality in the powers of the circulatory &s;y&s;tem, but al&s;o &s;upports a continuance of pre&s;&s;ure upon the brain, which is very mate|rial for the performance of its duty in the body; &s;ince we find in proportion as that organ is deprived of that pre&s;&s;ure, it per|forms not its functions regularly&mdash;hence convul&s;ions&mdash;faintings&mdash;death; and we al&s;o find the more plethoric a man is in a &s;tate of health, generally the more warmth he has in his ha|bit.</P>

Sudden and total ab&s;tinence therefore would prevent the regu|larity of the brain's action, and render the &s;y&s;tem languid from withdrawing the &s;timulus, by which it had been actuated&mdash;the ve&s;&s;els would collap&s;e&mdash;circulation would be carried on with difficulty&mdash;the heart oppre&s;&s;ed&mdash;and in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, &s;angui|nary concretions might be formed.

<P>Having examined the effects produced by &s;evere hunger, and gratification of the appetite copiou&s;ly and con&s;tantly, and &s;udden|ly changing from one to the other; let us now examine the con|&s;equences of the extremes of re&s;t and labour, &s;ucceeding each o|ther in the &s;ame manner.</P>

health, by promoting the circulation of the blood, and motion of the fluids, through the minute ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>But <HI>&s;leep</HI> is e&s;teemed the grand pre&s;erver and re&s;torer of health, &s;uch as is well-timed, and properly proportioned; for &s;ome con|&s;titutions require much more than others.&mdash;It is one thing the mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to life, as this is the time when the &s;y&s;|tem is freed from all incumbrances, undi&s;turbed by mental re|flections, which often di&s;order the animal economy, and prevent the human frame from acting, through all her departments, with equality, and full force, in which the nutritious particles, pro|perly perfected by the operation of the con&s;titution, or chiefly applied to repair the wa&s;te, and replace tho&s;e which have been abraded, and wa&s;hed off by the labor and exerci&s;e of the day.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated, the moving and a&s;&s;imilating powers of the bo|dy have only that bu&s;ine&s;s by which the parts are renewed to per|form, and the ve&s;&s;els are properly di&s;po&s;ed to receive &s;uch addi|tions as are required, and co-operate to that end; but if the ma|chine is too much indulged in this particular, it becomes much di&s;po&s;ed to be corpulent, languid, and weak, and feel a number of inconveniencies from thence ari&s;ing.</P>
<P>With regard to the time nece&s;&s;ary for the producing the good effects it is various in different con&s;titutions: &s;ix or &s;even hours re&s;t is &s;ufficient for many adult con&s;titutions, though &s;ome re|quire nine or twelve.&mdash;A lady whom I attended, of a relaxed and delicate habit, &s;ubject to hy&s;teric affections, and an acrimonious &s;tate of humors, though by no means indolently di&s;po&s;ed, was advi&s;ed to ri&s;e early, and gradually le&s;&s;en the time &s;he u&s;ed to de|vote to her bed, which was con&s;tantly twelve hours, and which was &s;uppo&s;ed to contribute much to the relaxation of her habit&mdash;&s;he made the attempt for &s;ome time, but could never enjoy &s;o comfortable a &s;tate of health, as when &s;he indulged her&s;elf in her u&s;ual cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>Still in many this indulgence enervates the &s;y&s;tem&mdash;renders them hypochondriacal and hy&s;terical&mdash;relaxes the &s;olids&mdash;di&s;|po&s;es the humors to be vi&s;cid, or acrimonious&mdash;blunts the vital powers&mdash;and brings on a di&s;ea&s;ed, and early old age.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding, we will allow that nature her&s;elf re|quires, in different con&s;titutions, &s;uch variability;&mdash;the cu&s;tom of &s;leeping long, and indulging in bed, is very frequently the re|&s;ult of indolence, early induced, and long encouraged:&mdash;&s;uch a di&s;graceful wa&s;te of time &s;hould be di&s;countenanced, and the ha|bit conquered, which may always be accompli&s;hed, in the ear|ly and middle part of life, where it ari&s;es not from con&s;titutional nece&s;&s;ity, naturally implanted; but it mu&s;t be done by &s;low de|grees, for all extremes of change are detrimental.</P>

It is the practice of numbers to indulge them&s;elves in &s;leep|ing in the day-time; &s;ome immediately after dinner&mdash;&s;till, not|with&s;tanding what has been advanced by &s;ome authors, that &s;leep is u&s;eful even at tho&s;e times, as it promotes dige&s;tion, I think the rule, very often, more &s;alutary in the breach than the con|formity; for it creates giddine&s;s and languor, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e addicted to &s;tudy&mdash;deadens their thinking faculties, de&s;troys per|&s;picuity, and clouds the imagination; but if no &s;uch effects are perceived, and people find them&s;elves recruited, alert, and active, it may be allowed.</P>
<P>In proportion as the powers of dige&s;tion are more or le&s;s &s;trong in different ages, with re&s;pect to DIET, they have claimed dif|ferent kinds.</P>

<P>IF we look into and examine the bills of mortality, to be in|formed at what ages the greate&s;t number of people die, we &s;hall find that half of them go off under the age of five years:&mdash;to what are we to attribute this? That nature is defective in her operations, and that half of mankind are born in &s;o imper|fect a &s;tate, formed of materials &s;o bad, or &s;o defectively united, that they cannot &s;upport the operations nece&s;&s;ary for the conti|nuance of their exi&s;tence any longer? Or are we to conclude that in that period they are &s;ubject to more fatal maladies, and die the victims of di&s;ea&s;e in greater proportion than at any o|ther time? Were &s;uch conclu&s;ions to be formed, we &s;hould be accu&s;ing the Omnipotence of Providence, or arraigning the prin|cipal Agent of Heaven, NATURE, of executing her office wan|tonly, or improvidently. This, then, cannot be the ca&s;e; for if we look through the vegetable or mineral kingdom, we &s;hall never find that any of their productions are &s;ubject to be de&s;troy|ed, merely becau&s;e they are in a &s;tate of primary exi&s;tence&mdash;or in the brute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, becau&s;e they are young. When de&s;truc|tion happens to them, it is from being placed in &s;uch &s;ituations, and under &s;uch circum&s;tances, as are not congenial with their peculiar nature:&mdash;&s;o happens it, I have no doubt, with the hu|man &s;pecies that this mortality in the infantile &s;tate is owing to bad nur&s;ing, where, by the&s;e means, the operations of the con|&s;titution are impeded, or perverted from the indolence, igno|rance, or &s;uper&s;tition of tho&s;e allotted to rear the infant in its tenderer years&mdash;and it is a&s;toni&s;hing, that, in a bu&s;ine&s;s requir|ing the utmo&s;t &s;implicity for its &s;ucce&s;s, &s;o many, and &s;uch great errors &s;hould be committed, as to become too certainly, and too commonly fatal, particularly in children born of delicate and weakly parents; who, partaking of their con&s;titutions, are liable to be &s;everely afflicted from indi&s;creet management, and want &s;trength to &s;truggle through calamities originating from that &s;ource.</P>
<P>Let us ca&s;t our eye among&s;t the hardy &s;ons of the ru&s;tic race&mdash;compare tho&s;e with the offspring of the more refined and po|li&s;hed&mdash;what a difference in appearance! Among&s;t the former, we find the children firm, robu&s;t, lively, healthful, active, and &s;trong; among&s;t the latter, weak, puny, relaxed, and &s;ickly. Among&s;t
<PB N="115" REF="028021_0111_0FD670EF465A09A0">
the former few die, but from the acce&s;&s;ion of unavoidable illne&s;s, as mea&s;les, &s;mall-pox, chin-cough, dentition, &amp;c. Among the latter numberle&s;s expire from gripes, loo&s;ene&s;&s;es, hectic fevers, worms and convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>But there are greater evils than di&s;&s;olution in this &s;tate from this cau&s;e; for from hence di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf is generated, and &s;o fix|ed in the habit, that the life of many is oftentimes one conti|nued &s;cene of mi&s;ery;&mdash;nay, I have no doubt but, from this &s;ource, the temper and di&s;po&s;ition acquire &s;o fretful a ca&s;t, and oftentimes is &s;o &s;oured, and rendered &s;o petulent and peevi&s;h, that, whil&s;t they do exi&s;t, they continue unhappy and mi&s;erable in them&s;elves, as well as trouble&s;ome and offen&s;ive to their at|tendants and their a&s;&s;ociates; for it has been allowed, that the faculties of the mind, very often depend upon the organs of the body; for when the&s;e are in a tolerable perfect &s;tate, &s;o as to perform their &s;eparate functions properly, the thinking part is more alert, active, and cheerful; and good-hu|mour the con&s;equence of &s;uch freedom&mdash;whil&s;t the contrary ef|fects are produced, when the organs are di&s;turbed, or di&s;ea&s;ed. To avoid, then, which di&s;agreeable effects, it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to lay down &s;uch regulations as are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounded on rational principles, &s;upported by experience, and which con&s;i&s;t in bringing up chil|dren in a plain and &s;imple manner, the mode mo&s;t con&s;onant with nature; and if we ob&s;erve the method &s;he invariably pur|&s;ues, we &s;hall find that &s;he delights in &s;implicity alone.

<P>It is the cu&s;tom next for nur&s;es to rub the child's head ex|tremely well with their hand after wa&s;hing, and apply brandy or &s;ome ardent &s;pirits at the &s;ame time, and then forcibly pre&s;s the head in different directions, under the notion of aiding in joining the bones, where the &s;utures are open, a contrivance of nature, apparently that in labour the dimen&s;ions of the head may
<PB N="117" REF="028021_0113_0FD670F0B4DD7280">
be le&s;&s;ened by the different bones riding one over the other, and delivery, by the&s;e means, be facilitated; after which the child's head is tight bound up with with a forehead cloth.</P>
<P>This over officiou&s;ne&s;s is highly detrimental and derogatory to the intent of nature; for by pre&s;&s;ing the head too forcibly, and keeping it in a confined &s;tate, prevents the proper circulation of the blood through the ve&s;&s;els of the brain, and brings on convul|&s;ions and other complaints from conge&s;tion; and all this without in the lea&s;t an&s;wering the intent for which this ab&s;urd cu&s;tom is practi&s;ed. For the bones join not by the edges of them coming in contact with each other, but from bony matter depo&s;ited in the cartilaginous and membranous &s;ub&s;tance of the cranium, and forming a junction in this way, and therefore the head &s;hould be le&s;t entirely to it&s;elf, after being well cleaned, without the labour has been very &s;evere; then &s;ometimes the vertex will be great|ly &s;welled by the long continuance of labour, occa&s;ioning great pre&s;&s;ure upon the larger part of the head, and impeding the re|turn of the fluids, by which the &s;kin on the vertex of the crani|um will be &s;o loaded with fluids, as &s;ometimes to produce a tu|mor, not inferior in &s;ize to a large egg, which may in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame and &s;uppurate, as I have ob&s;erved, particularly where imprudently managed.</P>
<P>In&s;tead, therefore, of &s;ubmitting the head to &s;o &s;evere friction, let it be bathed, where &s;welled, with brandy&mdash;arquabu&s;ade water&mdash;or &s;ome other ardent &s;pirits; or rags, three or four doubles, may be dipped in Goulard's &s;aturnine water, mixed with about a fourth or fifth part brandy, and applied to the part affected; and then the head &s;hould be covered with a loo&s;e flannel cap, over which may be placed a linen one, tied under the chin only ju&s;t &s;o tight as to keep it upon the head: and this operation may be repeated once a day till the &s;welling &s;ub&s;ides, which will com|monly be in the &s;pace of two or three days.</P>
<P>Under the idea of giving &s;trength to the child's back, and en|able it to &s;upport it&s;elf, it u&s;ed to be the practice, and &s;till con|tinues in &s;ome country villages, to &s;wathe or roll the child very tight round the abdomen, with a very broad roller; by which means the circulation of the blood was impeded, the &s;uperior parts loaded, the peri&s;taltic motion of the inte&s;tines, and the ac|tion of the abdominal mu&s;cles, hindered from properly perform|ing their offices; hence gripes&mdash;convul&s;ions&mdash;coughs&mdash;and gene|ral unea&s;ine&s;s. In&s;tead, therefore, of this roller, a &s;hort flannel petticoat, with a broad head &s;hould be tied round on the wai&s;t, only &s;o tight, as that a finger will ea&s;ily pa&s;s under it; &s;o that if the child's belly &s;wells, as it &s;ometimes will from flatulence, it may experience no unea&s;ine&s;s: and if after this a long linen

gown is put on, the child will be &s;ufficiently dre&s;&s;ed, be perfect|ly ea&s;y, and no ob&s;truction occur to prevent nature performing her proper operations. But there is another error frequently committed with re&s;pect to what they think nece&s;&s;ary to give the infant internally; therefore, as &s;oon as it is dre&s;&s;ed, they cram down its throat a large lump of butter and coar&s;e &s;ugar; or give it oil of &s;weet almonds and &s;yrup of violets: or &s;hould the infant lick its lips, it mu&s;t be fed with pig, that is, it mu&s;t be permit|ted to &s;uck the fat of that animal, in order to appea&s;e, it is &s;up|po&s;ed, a &s;en&s;ation which ari&s;es from its mother's having longed for &s;omething or another during her pregnancy.</P>
<P>Were there nothing but the mere folly and ab&s;urdity to be con&s;idered as the re&s;ult of this practice, it would not be nece&s;&s;a|ry to &s;ay any thing to induce its forbearance; but the&s;e things are pernicious, ina&s;much as they mix with the meconium, or hu|mor with which a child's bowels is naturally loaded, prevents its growing &s;ufficiently acrid to produce its purgative effect, or &s;heath the bowels from feeling the effect, and thus produce ma|ny complaints which load, oppre&s;&s;ion, and di&s;ten&s;ion of the in|te&s;tinal canal are apt to bring on: for nature &s;eems to intend this meconium to clear, at an early &s;tage, the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ordes which have accumulated there. If, therefore, it is deter|mined to give &s;omething to the infant, a little ca&s;tor oil, and &s;im|ple &s;yrup, will be the be&s;t, becau&s;e it an&s;wers the purpo&s;e intend|ed by the meconium. For if we con&s;ider the &s;tate of the infant during labour&mdash;the effects of the meconium left to it&s;elf&mdash;the time before the mother acquires her milk, and that its property is at fir&s;t aperient, we &s;hall obviou&s;ly &s;ee the rea&s;on, why nature pre&s;erves this regularity in &s;oliciting a di&s;charge of fluids through the primae viae; and &s;hew that if any thing is to be attempted, her plan ought to direct all our operations. For be&s;ides clear|ing the &s;tomach and bowels of its contents, which, by continu|ance there, might produce di&s;agreeable and dangerous effects, it &s;eems intended to prevent the too free determination of blood to|wards the ve&s;&s;els of the brain, which might be in a weakened &s;tate from the &s;everity of labour: for the brain very often &s;uffers great compre&s;&s;ion from the bones of the head pa&s;&s;ing through the pelvis; indeed it is often &s;o great, that the bones will wrap con|&s;iderably one over the other, and con&s;equently the capacity of the cranium be much dimini&s;hed; by which means the blood will be prevented from pa&s;&s;ing into the exterior part of the brain, which is thrown into the head by the arteries appropriated for that purpo&s;e, con&s;equently the internal ve&s;&s;els will receive a more than proper quantity, and by being too much di&s;tended, of cour&s;e be weakened, and that in proportion to the continuance and vi|olence
<PB N="119" REF="028021_0115_0FD670F47B31DAB8">
of &s;uch pre&s;&s;ure; in order, therefore, to prevent the mi&s;|chiefs which would ari&s;e from &s;uch debility, if continued, and the &s;ucceeding accumulation, I conceive nature very wi&s;ely con|&s;tituted purging, that the ve&s;&s;els may recover their due tone; and that this is one principal rea&s;on, I am induced to believe, from the fir&s;t of the mother's milk always having a purgative property.</P>
<P>But however, I think that the le&s;s any &s;ort of the&s;e things are given the better. As &s;oon, therefore, as the child is dre&s;&s;ed, and the mother laid in a clean and comfortable &s;ituation, the child &s;hould be placed in bed by her, and both left to go to re&s;t, which they will &s;oon do, and &s;leep perhaps for &s;ix or &s;even hours, by which means they will be refre&s;hed, and recover in a great de|gree the fatigue they have both undergone: then the mother &s;hould be fed with &s;ome thin broth, or weak wine gruel, and a little bread, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;imple materials; and the child, if the mother intends to nur&s;e it, &s;et to the brea&s;t; notwith&s;tanding what &s;ome authors have &s;aid to the contrary, under the idea, that as nature does not furni&s;h any quantity of milk in the brea&s;t, till the expiration of three days or thereabouts, it is u&s;ele&s;s, and only teazing to the mother and child, to have it &s;et to before. This I am perfectly per&s;uaded though is erroneous, and often attended with di&s;agreeable con&s;equences, both to the mother and infant, di&s;po&s;ing the former to febrile affections, and bringing on a milk fever, from pain created by di&s;tention of the ve&s;&s;els of the brea&s;t, and keeping the infant too long from that &s;alutary food which nature has provided for it, and acts at fir&s;t in a double ca|pacity, as we have before &s;pecified; be&s;ides it &s;upplies an oppor|tunity for ignorant and over officious nur&s;es to cram the chil|dren with a variety of dabs, and too vi&s;cid food; by which means a foundation is laid for a number of complaints, from loading and oppre&s;&s;ing the alimentary canal, by &s;uch things as are unconquerable by the dige&s;tive powers of the infantile &s;tate; hence ari&s;e crudities, acidity, flatulence, and convul&s;ions, which by a different management would be prevented. For by &s;etting the child at an early period to the mother's brea&s;t, by the gentle &s;timulus on the nipple from &s;ucking, the milk is &s;olicited in a gradual manner into the brea&s;t&mdash;the ve&s;&s;els are made by degrees permeable&mdash;the infant receives it at fir&s;t in &s;mall quantities, ad|equate to its wants and dige&s;tive powers&mdash;no &s;uperabundance of milk is collected, nor a &s;udden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low of it into the lactiferous tubes, by which di&s;ten&s;ion, pain, and febrile affections to the mother are prevented; the child's &s;tomach is not overloaded, nor too great a quantity of fluid thrown into the habit, which would be injurious to &s;everal parts of the machine, particularly

the head&mdash;lungs&mdash;and liver&mdash;as the circulation of the blood is now altered from what it was before the birth, and con&s;equently the ve&s;&s;els in tho&s;e organs incapable to bear &s;udden and too free di&s;ten&s;ion; for the parts of the human machine are always bet|ter enabled to &s;uffer changes brought on in a gradual and tem|perate mode, than by &s;uch as operate in the contrary extreme; and this &s;eems, in the ca&s;e of which we are &s;peaking, to be the intent of unerring nature; it is &s;o perfectly rational, that the de|&s;cription alone carries along with it conviction. Indeed, I am &s;o clearly convinced of the great utility and good con&s;equences ari&s;|ing from the adoption of this method, both from rea&s;on and ex|perience, that I univer&s;ally recommend it to tho&s;e who are capa|ble and willing to &s;uckle their own children; and in all health|ful &s;ubjects, it is a practice which &s;hould on no account be di&s;|pen&s;ed with; for to me, there is little doubt but that the milk of the mother is better adapted to the con&s;titution of her own offspring than of any other; be&s;ides the advantages attending the fir&s;t, as much &s;o, I think, as the natural &s;oil is to any indige|nous vegetable: nor do I &s;tand &s;ingle in this opinion; for many authors, who have written be&s;t on this &s;ubject, not only &s;upport the &s;ame doctrine, but think that the mother's milk is &s;ufficient for the nouri&s;hment of the infant for the fir&s;t twelve months, and recommend that, to that alone they &s;hould adhere.</P>
<P>Could we in&s;ure the health of the mother and child, I &s;hould not he&s;itate to enforce the cu&s;tom; but as both are liable to fall into di&s;po&s;itions, which may either, on the one hand, render the milk improper, from its nutritious qualities being altered; or, on the other, from its increa&s;ing &s;ome complaint in the primae viae. I think, during the child's being nouri&s;hed from the brea&s;t, it &s;hould be fed once or twice a day with the boat; that if any accident &s;hould render it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to wean the child, or take it for a time from the brea&s;t, no inconvenience may ari&s;e from &s;uch an alteration; for many children feed &s;olely by the brea&s;t&mdash;take very ill to the boat: nay, &s;ome indeed are obliged to be &s;upplied by the brea&s;t of a &s;tranger, a circum&s;tance often painful, and almo&s;t always di&s;agreeable to the parents&mdash;and as a &s;uccedaneum for the mother's milk that of a&s;&s;es is the be&s;t, or artificial a&s;&s;es milk with a little bread, called tops and bottoms; or roll, or bi&s;cuit&mdash;not the common bread, for that has in its compo&s;ition too much of alum, and may, in habits where there is a propen&s;ity to co&s;tivene&s;s, be particularly hurtful.</P>
<P>But as children are apt to have mo&s;t of their complaints ori|ginate from acidities in the &s;tomach and bowels, or to have &s;uch acidities very often as a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing con&s;equence, it would be right to u&s;e them to the ta&s;te of other viands; particularly weak veal

broth, or that of mutton; or beef &s;ea, if they &s;hould have no di&s;po&s;ition to febrile affections:&mdash;but, whatever the food, care &s;hould be taken never to overload the &s;tomach, as is too com|monly the cu&s;tom; &s;o much &s;o, that often, in the day, they may be ob&s;erved re&s;tle&s;s, unea&s;y, and &s;ick, and relieved alone by frequently puking&mdash;a happy remedy again&s;t the mi&s;taken huma|nity of over-fond mothers; for it is a common practice with them, and other nur&s;es, as &s;oon, or as often as a child cries, or appears fretful, to appea&s;e it by giving the brea&s;t, though it &s;hould, a few minutes before, have &s;ucked to &s;atiety. In&s;tead of this, the child &s;hould be amu&s;ed by dandling gently, or by &s;ome other means diverted: exerci&s;e however is the be&s;t, in propor|tion to its age. In the fir&s;t months, &s;uch as is moderate, and of the gentler kind; afterwards, as its &s;trength increa&s;es, &s;o may the exerci&s;e; for this quickens circulation, augments per&s;pira|tion, a&s;&s;i&s;ts dige&s;tion, and helps to clear away vi&s;ceral ob&s;tructi|ons, and prevent co&s;tivene&s;s. Indeed, in the early &s;tage, it is u&s;eful, twice a day, when dre&s;&s;ing and undre&s;&s;ing the child, for the nur&s;e to rub it well with her hands, particularly on the ex|tremities, down the back and abdomen, before the fire, for a quarter of an hour each morning and evening.&mdash;The infant will &s;hew its approbation, and the utility, by kicking and throwing about i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> legs, &s;miling, crowing, and by a perceptible brightne&s;s in its eyes, and cheerfulne&s;s in its countenance. In &s;ome coun|tries, particularly in &s;ome parts of Scotland, mothers very early adopt the cu&s;tom of dipping their children every morning into cold water; on which cu&s;tom Dr. Cullen makes the following ob&s;ervation: That he had &s;eldom, or never &s;een the offspring of their women, &s;o treated, &s;ubject to the rickets. It has long been recommended, and I think with &s;ome advantage, to wa&s;h the legs, thighs, back, and head, with cold water. In this cu&s;tom there appear two very material advantages&mdash;cleanline&s;s, and gently increa&s;ing the tone of the &s;y&s;tem: by which the &s;y&s;tem is unloaded, and &s;trength given to the mu&s;cular fibres. And upon the&s;e two principles, regularly promoted, is it, perhaps, that we may attribute, in a great degree, the prevention of that complaint we have ju&s;t alluded to&mdash;a complaint, the con&s;tant concomitant of na&s;tine&s;s, inordinate feeding, with improper food, and indolence.</P>
<P>Though this practice is very &s;erviceable to healthful children, &s;till, in &s;uch as are delicate, and di&s;po&s;ed to inte&s;tinal complaints, &s;ome attention ought to be paid to the degree of cold u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion; and therefore, in the&s;e, it may be prudent to mix a portion of warm water with that which is cold, &s;o that it may &s;till remain a proportionate degree of cold, compared with the
<PB N="122" REF="028021_0118_0FD670C171553DF0">
natural warmth of the con&s;titution, but of warmth compared with other common water; for we know that &s;ome will bear cold bathing, or wa&s;hing, and receive abundant benefit, if the degree of cold only be &s;uch, that the internal part of the &s;y&s;tem &s;hall be capable of producing re-action adequate to the impul&s;e of the fluids occa&s;ioned by the external application; if not, many di&s;agreeable con&s;equences occur, ari&s;ing from a load being thrown upon the internal parts too &s;uddenly, and too copiou&s;ly, &s;o as to overpower their action, &s;uch as conge&s;tions in, ob&s;tructions, and inflammations of the brain, lungs, vi&s;cera, and &s;ome of the glan|dular parts, wherever they appear, from their debility, to be mo&s;t predi&s;po&s;ed to &s;uch affections.</P>
<P>In this method it may be nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;i&s;t for three, four, or five months; but as children grow &s;tronger, they then gene|rally require thicker and &s;tronger food, given them once or twice a day; cow's milk with roll, bi&s;cuit. Tops and bottoms may be made u&s;e of, moderately &s;weetened, or panada, mixed with new milk, warm; and this food &s;hould be made fre&s;h twice a day in winter, and three times in &s;ummer: the new milk &s;hould not be boiled, but mixed with hot panada, or pap; nor &s;hould the viands be made &s;weeter than that of mother's milk, nor gi|ven hotter than milk from the cow; for victuals too hot, or too &s;weet, are apt to occa&s;ion relaxation of the &s;tomach and bowels, and create morbid a&s;cidity; and &s;hould the child be of a co&s;tive habit, &s;oft Li&s;bon &s;ugar, if laxative, &s;uperfine &s;ugar &s;hould be made u&s;e of: broths al&s;o &s;hould make part of their food, minc|ed chicken, or rabbit, with panada, and bread puddings, parti|cularly after they are weaned; con&s;equently, a little before, it would be right to accu&s;tom them to &s;uch &s;ort of food. Potatoes is a food which numbers of children are fond of, and are very early accu&s;tomed to; however, to tho&s;e of delicate habit, I think them by no means proper, nor any other that are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much vi&s;cidity, ina&s;much as the accumulation of &s;uch tenacious food in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines is apt to form a nidus for worms; but to tho&s;e of &s;trong dige&s;tive powers, born of health|ful, athletic parents, &s;uch as common ru&s;tics, this prohibition is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary; as it has been ob&s;erved, in countries where this vegetable root frequently and commonly makes part, and a great &s;hare of their diet, no &s;uch inconvenience has been ob&s;erved; but this depends not upon the &s;alubrity of &s;uch &s;ort of diet, but upon the firm &s;tamina, and great &s;trength of the dige&s;tive pow|ers of tho&s;e who feed on it&mdash;to the more delicate it is certainly injurious; and it is upon the &s;trength or debility of the con|&s;titutional powers by which we mu&s;t in general regulate our con|duct in our directions.&mdash;If children are born healthful, and &s;trong,
<PB N="123" REF="028021_0119_0FD670F8436D51C0">
&s;uch regulations as are above laid down, will be &s;ufficient to conduct them forwards, with ea&s;e and &s;afety, for the fir&s;t twelve months, or longer; but &s;hould they be born &s;ickly, as is &s;ome|times the ca&s;e, it may be a&s;ked, are the &s;ame rules to be ob&s;erv|ed? Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, cleanline&s;s, proper cloathing, gentle exerci&s;e, and the mother's milk, certainly form the be&s;t preventive and curative plan; for, by their proper adoption, I have no doubt but con&s;titutions, weakly in their origin, may be &s;trengthened, and a number of complaints, the natural re&s;ult of de|bility not only cured, but often prevented. Though &s;ome caution may be nece&s;&s;ary in feeding children naturally weak, great care &s;hould be taken never to overload the &s;tomach, notwith&s;tanding the food &s;hould be confined to that afforded by the mother; it, there|fore, &s;hould be advi&s;eable to give the brea&s;t to the child much oftner, &s;o that a little milk only may be taken at a time, which will be ea&s;ily and readily dige&s;ted. This may be con&s;idered trouble&s;ome to the mother, yet will &s;he be amply repaid, by &s;ee|ing her offspring improve daily under &s;uch judicious manage|ment, and meliorating a con&s;titution, which otherwi&s;e would be made wor&s;e, and fall a &s;acrifice to painful di&s;ea&s;e; for, by over|loading the &s;tomach, that organ would be weakened, crudities and acidities be generated, green &s;tools, loo&s;ene&s;s, gripes, and convul&s;ions be the unvoidable con&s;equences; for almo&s;t all com|plaints with which infants are at a very early period afflicted, except tho&s;e which ari&s;e hereditarily, from mal-conformation of &s;ome particular parts, infection, or contagion, deduce their ori|gin from defect in the alimentary tube, and that generally aci|dity, occa&s;ioned too often by indi&s;creet and too copious feeding. But when &s;uch acidities are too prevalent, they con&s;titute di&s;|ea&s;es, and will be taken notice of when we treat of &s;uch as are incident to children; we &s;hall only ob&s;erve, if there appears a pronene&s;s in the habit to produce them, be&s;ides the mode here directed for invigorating the con&s;titution, it might be proper, now and then, to put a little magne&s;ia into the victuals, if co&s;|tive: if otherwi&s;e, &s;ome of the other prepared ab&s;orbent earths, &s;uch as chalk, crabs eyes, or prepared hart&s;horn; feed the infant once or twice a day upon broth, and u&s;e rice in&s;tead of bread, for it is le&s;s apt to turn four than any other of the lighter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ari|naceous &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>But many authors have, re&s;pecting mothers &s;uckling their children, laid it down as an indi&s;pen&s;able duty, and advanced, that almo&s;t all, of whatever nature their con&s;titution may be, are capable of performing that office with the greate&s;t advan|tage to their own con&s;titutions, as well as to their children; for, &s;ays Dr. Cadogan, <Q>When a child &s;ucks its own mother, which,

<P><Q>This is a very mi&s;taken notion: for the fir&s;t general cau&s;e of mo&s;t people's di&s;ea&s;es is, not want of nouri&s;hment, as is here imagined, but too great a fulne&s;s and redundancy of humors;&mdash;good at fir&s;t, but being more than the body can employ, or con&s;ume, they &s;tag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">te, degenerate, and the whole ma&s;s be|comes corrupt, and produces many di&s;ea&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>However, notwith&s;tanding this authority, I am certain that there are many mothers totally incapable of giving &s;uck, parti|cularly &s;uch as are of very delicate nervous con&s;titutions, weak appetites, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of bad dige&s;tive powers&mdash;who&s;e fluids are acrimonious and habits &s;ubject to hy&s;teric affections; for the&s;e, in general, neither afford milk &s;ufficient in quantity, not proper|ly elaborated for nutrition: hence, when they attempt to &s;uc|kle their children, they do infinite mi&s;chief to their own con&s;ti|tutions, by having it debilitated by the con&s;tant drain of what &s;hould &s;upport them&s;elves, and lay the foundation for a variety of complaints in their offspring, by pouring into it &s;uch crude unwhole&s;ome fluid. The children of &s;uch women &s;hould either be &s;et to another woman's brea&s;t, or brought up by the boat. IF <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, there are &s;ome precautions requi&s;ite to be ob|&s;erved, &s;uch as we are directed to by the imitation of nature&mdash;as the infant is deprived of the mother's fir&s;t milk, which is pur|gative, and clears the primae viae of their &s;ordes, art mu&s;t &s;upply the deficiency by gentle means: the infant, then, &s;hould have &s;ome aperient ingredient mixed with its food, as will prove pur|gative&mdash;the be&s;t of which is manna, and pulp of ca&s;&s;ia. The&s;e may be given in &s;uch quantities as will procure the child four &s;tools every day for about eight or nine days; or a little ca&s;tor

oil, mixed with &s;yrup, may be given at proper intervals. Once a day, perhaps, may be &s;ufficient; or the nur&s;e may take &s;ome aperient electuary for the fir&s;t week of &s;uckling, which will &s;ome|times an&s;wer the purpo&s;e equally, in &s;uch do&s;es only as may im|pregnate the milk with &s;ome of its aperient properties; after which, the &s;ame directions &s;hould be pur&s;ued as have been before &s;et down.</P>
<P>But with regard to the &s;election of a nur&s;e much is nece&s;&s;ary. She &s;hould be young, cleanly, active, healthful, free from any complaint, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a good appetite, and quick, ea&s;y, dige&s;tive powers; and, above all things, her milk &s;hould not be too old&mdash;the nearer the time to her having laid in the better, for the milk will then partake more of the nature of the mother's milk. I have &s;aid &s;he &s;hould be young&mdash;by that I mean between twenty and thirty, for, at this time of life, they are generally in the mo&s;t healthy &s;tate, mo&s;t active, and more capable of contending with fatigue, and other unavoidable ca&s;ualties, without prejudic|ing their milk&mdash;which fluid it will be nece&s;&s;ary to examine, for &s;ome women's milk is apt to be too thick, &s;weet, and rich, whil&s;t others appear thin and watery&mdash;that is be&s;t which partakes nei|ther too much of the one or the other of the&s;e extremes.</P>
<P>Sometimes I have known parents very &s;olicitous of dieting nur&s;es, in order to keep the milk in proper order, and this I have &s;een productive of bad effects. I would by no means take any nur&s;e from that mode of living by which &s;he enjoyed a good and perfect &s;tate of health; for though we may tell what appears likely to produce general effects in the habit, if we form our judgment from experiments made on different materials out of the con&s;titution, &s;till the peculiarities there exi&s;ting, which can only be di&s;covered by effects, make &s;uch alterations, the cau&s;e of which we are unable to inve&s;tigate, and &s;hould therefore be con|tent with ob&s;erving the con&s;equences. I &s;hould, therefore, re|commend that nur&s;es &s;hould live in the common plain mode, of viands &s;imple and nutritious, compo&s;ed of animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, avoiding all high-&s;ea&s;oned di&s;hes, or &s;alted provi&s;ions; for the&s;e become difficult of dige&s;tion, create thir&s;t, induce fe|brile affections, and promote an acrimonious &s;tate of fluids. I &s;pecify this, becau&s;e nur&s;es, often taken into great families, are very de&s;irous of quitting their homely fare, and indulging in the luxuries of high life.</P>
<P>If the BOAT is MADE CHOICE OF, a &s;imilar mode &s;hould be pur&s;ued with regard to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the primae viae, and the viands with which the child &s;hould be fed, mu&s;t be &s;uch as mo&s;t re&s;em|ble the mother's milk, fluid, not too &s;weet, nor given too hot, and partaking, in &s;ome degree, of animal and vegetable nature&mdash;a&s;&s;|es,

or artificial a&s;s's milk, mixed with thin panada, made as above directed, or milk, warm from the cow: perhaps, in both ca&s;es, feeding children at &s;tated periods, about four times a day will be &s;ufficient, if that cu&s;tom is begun very early.</P>
<P>So e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary has exerci&s;e been con&s;idered towards the &s;upport of health, that it has been advi&s;ed by every author; but it &s;hould be &s;uch as is adapted to the age and con&s;titution of the patient: in the fir&s;t periods very gentle, afterwards in|crea&s;ed, as the &s;trength of the infant increa&s;es, and that will be always the be&s;t, which, at the &s;ame time it gives motion to the body, appears to divert and entertain, for the &s;pirits by the&s;e means are exhilirated, and the mind, from being amu&s;ed, gives al&s;o quickne&s;s and &s;trength to nervous and va&s;cular action&mdash;rub|bing the child well before the fire twice a day we have &s;pecified, gently &s;winging, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oi&s;ting for &s;ome time together, before &s;ome objects which engage its attention, cau&s;ing the little infant to laugh, kick its legs, and exert its whole body by little &s;prings, in the nur&s;e's arms, will be proper; for no child can continue long well that is &s;uffered to &s;it like a log in an indolent nur&s;e's arms; for &s;uch a &s;edentary po&s;ition breeds crudities, occa&s;ions the habit to be overloaded, blunts the activity of the ve&s;&s;els, re|tards circulation, and breeds a variety of complaints from inter|nal conge&s;tion;&mdash;nor &s;hould nur&s;es be permitted to carry children always in one arm, a cu&s;tom too many acquire, but more parti|cularly if the infant is inactive and weakly; for, from always reclining to one &s;ide, di&s;tortion is apt to take place: therefore, they &s;hould con&s;tantly be removed from one to the other. It is highly u&s;eful to &s;uffer little ones to roll upon carpets, and be a|mu&s;ed with &s;ome little toy or other, that may entice their exer|tions, to creep from place to place after it. This is a plea&s;ant exerci&s;e, and early teaches an active u&s;e of their little limbs&mdash;and I have ob&s;erved children, &s;o brought up, more early get upon their legs, and run about, than others who have been u&s;ed to leading-&s;trings, go-carts, and contrivances of the&s;e kinds; it is mo&s;t advi&s;eable fir&s;t to lead them off gently by the finger, and that may be attempted at a more early period than &s;ome advi&s;e&mdash;for the idea of &s;etting children upon their legs very &s;oon, occa|&s;ions them to be crooked, is not in fact true&mdash;&s;o far from that, it gives them additional &s;trength; and it has been ob&s;erved, that the legs of children which have at fir&s;t appeared crooked, have, by early exertions to walk, become &s;tronger, and perfectly &s;traight.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e things, children &s;hould often be taken into the fre&s;h air, and remain therein for &s;ome time, at lea&s;t twice a day, and always be kept perfectly clean, changing their cloths imme|diately

<P>BEFORE we enter on that part of our plan, wherein we in|tend to de&s;cribe di&s;ea&s;es, and lay down their mo&s;t approved modes of cure, it will be proper to &s;ay &s;omething on the differ|ent nature of the remedies which will be recommended, in or|der to render the knowledge in their application more &s;afe, ea|&s;y, and certain;&mdash;as well as to explain the different general terms under which they are cla&s;&s;ed&mdash;as to the&s;e general terms we &s;hall be unavoidably led very often to have recour&s;e.</P>
<P>But previous to the forming our arrangement, we think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;pecify the different modes of action of various medi|cines taken from their known effects, as we find from experience they act in various ways&mdash;and we &s;hall fir&s;t ob&s;erve&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>That&mdash;active medicines</HI> produce their effects, by confining their action to the moving powers of the con&s;titution, page 56, locally, or &s;ympathetically;&mdash;if we except water, con&s;idered as a diluent, or &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances, where water abounds in a &s;uperabundant quantity.</P>
<P><HI>That no medicine</HI> acts upon the femina morbi, or particles, which form the origin of &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es;&mdash;except they lodge in the &s;tomach, inte&s;tines, or &s;ome other cavities, where they come in contact in an unaltered &s;tate with the cau&s;e of the affections:&mdash;con&s;equently that there are very few, which can in any ca&s;e be con&s;idered as &s;pecific;&mdash;and then only in this way.</P>

<P><HI>That&mdash;medicines</HI> do not always in &s;imilar do&s;es produce the &s;ame effects, on di&s;&s;imilar con&s;titutions&mdash;nor, before the trial, can the active do&s;e be di&s;covered;&mdash;therefore in the exhibition of all powerful medicines, this general rule &s;hould be ob&s;erved&mdash;<HI>to begin with &s;mall do&s;es, and gradually increa&s;e them, till the pro|per con&s;titutional do&s;e is manife&s;ted;</HI>&mdash;that is, till nau&s;ea, &s;ick|ne&s;s, or &s;ome unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation in the &s;tomach is created, then by le&s;&s;ening the do&s;e in a &s;light degree, the full one may be a&s;|certained&mdash;and this holds good in all active medicines&mdash;except &s;uch where benefit is &s;uppo&s;ed to be derived from occa&s;ioning nau&s;ea, or &s;ickne&s;s&mdash;as occurs often in the admini&s;tration of quills&mdash;ipecacuanha&mdash;and &s;ome antimonial preparations.</P>

<P>But though they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch various properties, they are all of them reducible to one &s;tate, in order to promote &s;up|port to the animal; and the changes they undergo for this end are brought about by three different ways in the <HI>fir&s;t in&s;tance</HI>&mdash;for <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the &s;olid food is minutely divided, and has its texture in a great degree broken down by chewing, and farther reduced by the action of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines&mdash;this is called COM|MINUTION.&mdash;It al&s;o forms an union with the &s;aliva, air, juices of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines&mdash;tho&s;e of the liver and &s;weetbread&mdash;this is termed COMMIXTURE&mdash;and add to the&s;e the heat it re|ceives, by which it is thrown into the third mode, or FERMENT|ATION&mdash;and all this it undergoes in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages.&mdash;<HI>In the &s;e|cond,</HI> it experiences great divi&s;ibility, union, and mixture, in pa&s;&s;ing through the lacteal ve&s;&s;els, and by the force of the lungs;&mdash;and, <HI>lo&s;tly,</HI> it is brought into its mo&s;t perfect nutritive &s;tate by the impre&s;&s;ive influence of the circulatory &s;y&s;tem upon their contained fluids. Hence we may conci&s;ely &s;ay, that the a&s;&s;imi|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> or our food, for the purpo&s;e of nutrition, is performed by COMMINUTION&mdash;COMMIXTURE&mdash;and FERMENTATION.</P>
<P>And from this we may under&s;tand why all nutritious &s;ub|&s;tances &s;hould be adapted, both with regard to their quantity and quality, to the &s;trength and vigour of the&s;e powers collectively
<PB N="133" REF="028021_0129_0FD6710510FC7708">
con&s;idered&mdash;and al&s;o are we taught what mi&s;chiefs often ari&s;e from the indi&s;creet indulgence of fond mothers, and ridiculous nur&s;es, who load tho&s;e, who are weak in &s;ome or all the&s;e parti|culars, too freely with food, con&s;idered in it&s;elf &s;o be nutritious, in order that they may acquire &s;trength,&mdash;and by the&s;e means, de&s;troy the effect, by large quantities being poured into the ha|bit, which &s;maller proportions of the &s;ame food would have in|di&s;putably &s;upplied;&mdash;for if the dige&s;tive powers are loaded with a &s;uperabundant quantity more than they can conquer, they be|come, as it were, di&s;ea&s;ed; and even the &s;mall portion of food, to which their powers were adequate, left in a &s;tate too imperfect for affording any nutrition. And this rule is extremely worthy of attention&mdash;for valetudinarians, however proper their food, &s;hould never take more than they can bear with the greate&s;t ea&s;e. Indeed, in people recovering from very &s;evere illne&s;s, where the active powers of the habit have been greatly enfeebled, though it is always right to throw in food of the mo&s;t nutritious nature, the mo&s;t ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, and &s;uch as &s;its the mo&s;t light on the &s;tomach, &s;till &s;hould we begin with &s;mall quantities, increa&s;ing them, and altering the food in proportion as the patient recovers &s;trength; and this for very obvious rea&s;ons, which will &s;oon ap|pear, as we examine the nature of our food more minutely than we have done in &s;peaking of the non-naturals.</P>
<P>Though we have before &s;aid, that perhaps our fir&s;t food par|took mo&s;t of a vegetable nature, yet as all &s;ub&s;tances are the more nutritious, the more they approach to that of animal, a di|vi&s;ion &s;eems here requi&s;ite, in order to &s;hew the different de|grees they maintain with re&s;pect to the nutriment they afford, and the proper modes of be&s;t acquiring and applying them to the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>NUTRIENTS, therefore, may not improperly be arranged un|der three heads:</P>
<P>1. ANIMAL 2. VECETABLE 3. MIXED.</P>
<P>Of the FIRST&mdash;All tho&s;e are the mo&s;t powerfully, and mo&s;t quickly nutritious, which have the lea&s;t acidity, and are mo&s;t elaborated, or brought neare&s;t to the nature of animal fluids&mdash;hence the finer juices of the older animals become the mo&s;t eli|gible, and the&s;e are be&s;t procured by &s;light boiling, or infu&s;ing, in &s;uch a diluted &s;tate as the circum&s;tances may require; that is, in proportion to the &s;trength of the dige&s;tive powers;&mdash;for, as we con&s;ider the very fine juices of animal &s;ub&s;tances the mo&s;t nutri|tious, becau&s;e more readily a&s;&s;imilated to our own nature, for very weak debilitated habits, infu&s;ion is the mo&s;t advantageous proce&s;s, as by the&s;e means the &s;ubtler parts are pre&s;erved, which by long or quick boiling would be di&s;&s;ipated&mdash;but for tho&s;e po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="134" REF="028021_0130_0FD670D06ED78420">
of &s;tronger dige&s;tive powers, there is not &s;o much nece&s;&s;ity for this nicety.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e materials the mo&s;t nutritious are, beef&mdash;and mutton|tea&mdash;as they are called&mdash;made in the following manner.</P>
<P>Take of the lean part of beef, or mutton, one pound, cut it in|to thin &s;lices, and let the texture be well broken, by brui&s;ing it, then add to this one quart of boiling water, in an earthen or tin ve&s;&s;el, keep i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> clo&s;e covered till it is quite cold&mdash;or boil them o|ver a quick fire, for five minutes; &s;eparate the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">um, and decant the clear liquor for u&s;e;&mdash;but &s;hould we require more of the &s;tronger parts of them, the liquor may boil ten, fifteen, or twen|ty minutes, and then proceed as before directed.</P>
<P>The juices of the older animals are preferable to tho&s;e of the younger, becau&s;e tho&s;e of the latter are more tenacious, and par|take not &s;o much of the nature of our own fluids, con&s;equently yield, in that re&s;pect, to the former.</P>
<P>But when it is requi&s;ite that the fle&s;h of animals &s;hould be giv|en in its &s;olid form&mdash;that of young ones is con&s;idered the mo&s;t proper, as their fibres are much more tender, mo&s;t ea&s;ily broken down by chewing, and yield their nutritious part more readily to the acting powers of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>MILK, of which we have before &s;poken, pages 82, 83, though of a mixed nature, between animal and vegetable, we con&s;ider next; for it is a fluid only half perfected, and partakes, in &s;ome degree, of each of the other cla&s;&s;es. We have, in another place, delivered our &s;entiments on the allowed degrees of preference one &s;pecies of milk has to another, and have &s;hewn that of a&s;&s;es to be the be&s;t of any which could be procured in proper quantity&mdash;we &s;hall here, therefore, only ob&s;erve, where that cannot be ac|quired, either from the greatne&s;s of the expence, or the &s;carcity, of the animal, the following, called <HI>artificial a&s;&s;es milk,</HI> is not an inefficacious &s;uccedaneum:</P>
<P>Take of candied eryngo root, one ounce; pearl barley, half an ounce; liquori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e root, three drams; boil them in two pints of water till they are reduced to one, then add one pint of milk fre&s;h from the cow, boil them gently together, and &s;train for u&s;e. Half a pint of this &s;hould be drank, in general, two or three times a day; but &s;hould that quantity be too large, it may be reduced, and repeated oftener.</P>
<P>The VEGETABLE CLASS has been con&s;idered as more difficult of a&s;&s;imilation than either of the other, becau&s;e it is more di&s;tant in its nature from our fluids; and perhaps tho&s;e may be found the mo&s;t nutritious that approach nearer to milk, that is, more impregnated with oil, not e&s;&s;ential&mdash;&s;accharine &s;ub&s;tance&mdash;and a &s;mall portion of vegetable acid; for it is from the&s;e qua|lities

that all nutrition, in food of this &s;ort, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be de|rived.</P>
<P>We have &s;poken here, and in another place, of the&s;e things, merely as appropriated to afford nouri&s;hment only to the animal; but they mu&s;t be allowed to have other properties, which it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pecify, as by the&s;e means different changes are pro|duced in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>ANIMAL FOOD, particularly fi&s;h, is more &s;timulant and al|cale&s;cent, becau&s;e more prone to run into that &s;tate, which gene|rates pungent acrimonious &s;alts, con&s;equently becomes more heating.</P>
<P>VEGETABLE, more diluent and ace&s;cent, from its being more replete with aqueous particles, and having &s;trong propen&s;i|ties, from their very nature, to become acid&mdash;hence more cool|ing.</P>
<P>Milk, in this in&s;tance, partakes more of the latter, as it is &s;ub|ject, left to it&s;elf, to become acid; be&s;ides, vegetables are more emollient and &s;heathing, as mo&s;t of them abound not only with watery particles in great proportion, but al&s;o with tho&s;e which are mucilaginous; and &s;eem to have in&s;pi&s;&s;ating, or thickening powers, from their mixture with the fluids: hence, if we take in the account the quantity of fixed air with which they are re|plete, we may be convinced of their utility in ca&s;es of the &s;ea or true &s;curvy, and in all tho&s;e morbid habits, where the fluids have acquired too great degrees of thinne&s;s, from inherent or accident|al acrimony. Milk al&s;o retains the &s;ame properties.</P>
<P>Roa&s;ted&mdash;broiled&mdash;or fried animal food, is more &s;timulant than boiled, and runs quicker into a &s;tate of putre&s;cency&mdash;from the different culinary proce&s;&s;es they undergo: the fir&s;t being prepar|ed only by the action of &s;trong heat, by which means the fluids are rendered more pungent, and more highly alcale&s;cent&mdash;the la&s;t receiving a le&s;s degree of heat, and through an aqueous medium, with which part of the animal juices are mixed, rendered more dilute, and le&s;s highly &s;ubtilized;&mdash;but when &s;tewed down, to a great degree, and eat with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">luids with which it is prepared, it approaches nearer to the former, than when only infu&s;ed, or gently &s;immered; nay, indeed, often exceeds them; and hence becomes al&s;o more difficult to be concocted or conquered by the dige&s;tive organs.</P>
<P>Of the vegetable cla&s;s, we have &s;aid farinaceous &s;ub&s;tances are the mo&s;t nutritious, and tho&s;e which have undergone &s;ome culi|nary proce&s;s, becau&s;e their fibrous parts are rendered more ten|der: and tho&s;e which are mo&s;t ea&s;ily a&s;&s;imilated, which contain the mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;accharine &s;ub&s;tance, and a &s;mall portion of vegeta|table acid; con&s;equently tho&s;e which have &s;uffered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

and fermentation, as they become &s;weeter, and have their vi&s;cid parts rendered thinner, and more flexile, by tho&s;e means are more ea&s;ily dige&s;tible;&mdash;But we mu&s;t in this place make one ob&s;erva|tion, which affords an objection to what is advanced.&mdash;There are another cla&s;s of vegetables, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be more nutri|tious&mdash;and the&s;e are the FUNGI, or tho&s;e fungous extuberances, called <HI>Mu&s;hrooms,</HI> or <HI>Champignons&mdash;Truffles&mdash;Mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">es,</HI> named by NERO, <HI>the Victuals of the Gods</HI>&mdash;they are con&s;idered to afford more nutriment, from yielding, on their chemical decompo&s;ition, materials &s;imilar to animal food. DR. CULLEN &s;ays, <Q>if they are truly vegetable matters, of which &s;ome have doubted, they are very different from every other vegetable with which we are acquainted&mdash;for in the fir&s;t part of their di&s;tillation, without addition, they give out no acid, but a large proportion of vo|latile &s;alt;&mdash;and expo&s;ed to undergo a &s;pontaneous fermenta|tion, they manife&s;t no ace&s;cency, but become immediately pu|trid&mdash;hence &s;hew they a very near re&s;emblance to animal &s;ub|&s;tances; and it may be pre&s;umed, that they are more con&s;i|derably nutritious than almo&s;t any truly vegetable &s;ub&s;tanc|es.</Q></P>
<P>I have in&s;erted thus much relative to the&s;e fungi, in order that we may be acquainted with their particular u&s;es, not as cor|rectors of animal food, like other vegetables, but rather as ani|mal food it&s;elf, and correctors of acidity in the &s;tomach&mdash;and on this account become a plea&s;ing delicacy to &s;uch, who are forbid the u&s;e of all vegetables, on account of a prevalent redundancy of acid in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>All the acrid&mdash;bitter&mdash;or highly flavoured vegetables, as they con&s;i&s;t of parts which are not readily &s;ubdued by the dige&s;tive powers, but pa&s;s in an unaltered &s;tate in the cour&s;e of circula|tion, come more properly under the cla&s;s of medicinal &s;ub|&s;tances.</P>
<P>Under this head of Nutrients we &s;hall have no occa&s;ion to &s;up|ply a general catalogue, for all tho&s;e things fall under this cla&s;s which we employ as food, and include whatever we eat and drink for the purpo&s;e of &s;upporting the animal machine, and re|pairing its wa&s;te.&mdash;And if we revert to what has been &s;aid in treating on aliment, p. 70, and on tho&s;e liquids we in common drink, p. 80, with what we have here advanced, we &s;hall be &s;upplied with knowledge &s;ufficient properly to direct us in our &s;election; for I am fully per&s;uaded, that we oftener err by the quantity of food that we take, than the quality; as it is certain, &s;uch is the power inherent in our habits, that though our food may be in its own nature in any particulars di&s;&s;imilar, &s;till if we only &s;upply &s;uch quantities as are judiciou&s;ly approportioned to

our dige&s;tive powers, whatever the aliments on which we feed, they will all be reduced to the &s;ame &s;tate, adapted to the pre&s;er|vation and nouri&s;hing of the machine; we &s;hall therefore advert to our next &s;ubject.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. ASTRINGENTS, from the Latin word <HI>a&s;tringo,</HI> to bind, or conden&s;e, which are all &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as by their action render the &s;ofter parts more compact, give a greater firmne&s;s to the &s;olids, and a cohe&s;ive tenacity to the fluids. Their parti|cular power in conden&s;ing the &s;olids is obvious from the effects which they produce in tanning, or making of leather.</P>
<P>BOERHAAVE was of opinion, that, when applied, they bring two di&s;tant parts of a moving fibre into clo&s;er contact, and into a more firm cohe&s;ion, and this by in&s;inuating between each particle of the fibre another of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>Dr. CULLEN thinks, that as a fibre is compo&s;ed of &s;olid and fluid, the cohe&s;ion of the whole is increa&s;ed by dimini&s;hing the watery, or by addition of the &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance: but is rather a fa|vourer of the fir&s;t opinion.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the addition of any &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance, it may be the ca&s;e when acting on the inert &s;olids, free from the influence of the vital, or nervous power; but in the living machine, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e medicines of this cla&s;s derive from this &s;ource their operation; for under tho&s;e circum&s;tances the medicine mu&s;t be univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed, and come in contact immediately with the parts upon which it acts.</P>
<P>This, therefore, cannot be true&mdash;if we con&s;ider the very &s;mall portion of tho&s;e which &s;hew their general a&s;tringent power, when taken upon the &s;tomach, and the very quick mode in which they produce their effects; be&s;ides, the variety of &s;ub|&s;tances which manife&s;t a con&s;tringent efficacy, when the machine is variou&s;ly affected from different cau&s;es.</P>
<P>In proof of this we &s;hall mention &s;ome few particulars:</P>
<P>ALUM, when given in do&s;es of a few grains, has been known to &s;top profu&s;e bleedings, ari&s;ing from a relaxation of the &s;olids, in a &s;hort &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>WHITE VITRIOL&mdash;BARK&mdash;STEEL&mdash;and &s;ome other of the &s;trongly acting medicines, have cau&s;ed the ce&s;&s;ation of other di&s;charges, by invigorating the &s;y&s;tem, and not from the locality of their application.</P>
<P>PUNGENT STIMULANTS have produced in&s;tantaneous effects, though not durable, in ca&s;es of laxity.</P>
<P>SEDATIVES, or tho&s;e medicines which manife&s;t their ef|fects by alleviating pain, and abating the quickne&s;s of va&s;cular
<PB N="138" REF="028021_0134_0FD670D504131358">
action, have early &s;hewn their power in the abatement of acrid defluxions.</P>
<P>Now it appears evidently that all the&s;e produce their influence by their action on the &s;tomach &s;ympathetically conveyed to the machine in general, and to the parts particularly affected, which, as being in a more morbid &s;tate, they experience more power|fully.</P>
<P>With regard to the fluids, tho&s;e medicines which have the power of &s;heathing acrimonious particles, from whence di&s;charges have proceeded, may be con&s;idered as a&s;tringents. In fine, what|ever will promote a contraction of the &s;olids, or coagulation of the fluids, come under this cla&s;s.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that many of the&s;e excite their action in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, but do not give the &s;y&s;tem the power of conti|nuing the effect;&mdash;whil&s;t others act more &s;lowly, &s;till occa&s;ion, as it were, a permanency to that action in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>VOLATILE &s;ub&s;tances&mdash;e&s;&s;ential oils, and others of this cla&s;s promote very quickly the influence of the vital powers, by which means the con&s;titution very early is made &s;en&s;ible of their pow|er, but as &s;oon as they cea&s;e to act, which they do in a &s;hort &s;pace, the morbid effects, they &s;eem to have conquered, are re|produced.&mdash;Alum al&s;o labours under the &s;ame di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>But the more &s;lowly acting a&s;tringents continue their force longer, and appear to give a &s;tronger and more la&s;ting cohe&s;ive power to the particles of the &s;olid fibres, as if they increa&s;ed their attractive influence <HI>inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>From this knowledge we &s;hall be able to deduce a mode of pre&s;cribing, of infinite u&s;e in practice, which would at an earlier period have been con&s;idered as contradictory, and ridiculous, becau&s;e deviating from the commonly received opinion&mdash;for, from what has been advanced, we &s;ee that volatiles and a&s;trin|gents may be judiciou&s;ly united, and will be the means of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing the effects of each other, by producing them &s;ooner, and making them more la&s;ting&mdash;as I have often found in the cour&s;e of practice, particularly where the con&s;titution has been defec|tive in va&s;cular irritability, and nervous incitability; for, by ad|ding volatiles and pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ent &s;timulants to bark, in many ca&s;es, the wi&s;hed-for effects have been produced, which could not be attained by bark alone.</P>
<P>To the&s;e, where the humors are acrimonious, &s;heathing medi|cines, called demulcents, may be joined;&mdash;and &s;edatives occa&s;ion|ally had recour&s;e to, where &s;pa&s;ms attend relaxation of the &s;olids.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that where the a&s;tringent &s;aline minerals, &s;uch as tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;white, and blue vitriol&mdash;the preparations of lead&mdash;alum, &amp;c. may be thought proper, vola|tiles

mu&s;t not be joined with them, as they will occa&s;ion a de|compo&s;ition, and render the a&s;tringent power of the compound mineral le&s;s active, nay, perhaps, de&s;troy it altogether.</P>
<P>The catalogue, pre&s;ented to us by various authors, is extreme|ly copious, but we &s;hall content our&s;elves with a few, which are in general allowed to be the mo&s;t efficacious.</P>

<P>&sect; 3. EMOLLIENTS&mdash;&s;o denominated from the latin word emolle&s;co, to grow &s;oft or &s;upple.</P>
<P>The&s;e act in a mode oppo&s;ite to the preceding cla&s;s, ina&s;much as a&s;tringents give firmne&s;s to, the&s;e induce a relaxation in the &s;olids.</P>
<P>They have been called RELAXANTS, and may be con&s;idered as &s;uch, if we include their mode of action in a double &s;en&s;e;
<PB N="141" REF="028021_0137_0FD6710F755394B0">
for though they have been thought to produce &s;uch a change in the &s;olids as occa&s;ioned them to be extended, more than they were before, without rupture; &s;till they have been acknowledged to reduce a part of the body, indurated and compacted in one uni|form bulk, into its &s;tate of contained liquid, and containing &s;o|lid.</P>
<P>It has been conjectured, that emollients act chiefly upon the &s;olids, by introducing their particles, which con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of the watery, mucilaginous, and oleaginous kind, between tho&s;e which compo&s;e the &s;olid fibre, thus forcing them farther from their &s;phere of attraction, and bringing them nearer to a &s;tate of fluid|ity; for &s;olids and fluids differ but in proportion to the &s;tronger or weaker attractive power of their component parts.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this may be the ca&s;e in many, nay, per|perhaps mo&s;t in&s;tances, &s;till they may produce their effects ge|nerally over the &s;y&s;tem by their action on the &s;tomach; for if that organ is relaxed, &s;o will all the other parts, dependent upon it, without having any watery particles introduced to weaken their texture.</P>
<P>FEAR and GRIEF are powerful relaxants, but the&s;e may be &s;aid to affect the mind and vital power, and hence produce their effects.</P>
<P>INEBRIATION has with numbers the &s;ame con&s;equence, but this ari&s;es from the relaxed &s;tate of the &s;tomach, which is &s;oon taken off by &s;timulating that organ, as has before been &s;pecified in the beginning of this work.</P>
<P>Women in general experience &s;imilar mi&s;chiefs, from repeat|edly drinking <HI>hot tea,</HI> and other liquids under the &s;ame circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>EMETICS given only in &s;mall nau&s;eating do&s;es, enervate, and relax the &s;y&s;tem from the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>SEDATIVES (chap. 2. &sect; 3.) may al&s;o be con&s;idered in &s;ome de|gree under this head.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, however, which produce their effect upon the machine in general by &s;ympathetic power, will be con&s;idered under differ|ent heads. Under emollients we mean to rank only &s;uch &s;ub|&s;tances as act from their watery, mucilaginous, and oily particles, of which they con&s;i&s;t; and the&s;e prove mo&s;t effectual on the parts to which they are more immediately applied, which DR. CUL|LEN conceives to act in one of the&s;e two ways; <Q>the one by being in&s;inuated into the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;olid, and thereby dimini&s;hing the den&s;ity of the whole of the mixt, they dimi|ni&s;h its force of cohe&s;ion. The other is, when, by being in&s;i|nuated into the inter&s;tices of, or &s;paces between dry particles, they dimini&s;h the friction which might otherwi&s;e occur, and
<PB N="142" REF="028021_0138_0FD670D37018F530">
thereby render the whole more flexible. The former &s;eems to be the operation of water, the latter of mucilage and oil.</Q></P>
<P>And the&s;e three &s;eem to include all the emollients, if we were to examine the articles, multifarious as they are, which con&s;ti|tute this cla&s;s. Indeed, for internal u&s;e, the writer above &s;pecifi|ed rejects the whole, and gives the preference to the infu&s;ion or decoction of lintfeed; which is fully as efficacious as any other.</P>
<P>And here, though we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that as in many febrile complaints the u&s;e of emollients &s;eem ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, where the degree of febrile affection runs very high, we are rather to adhere to tho&s;e of the watery, mucilaginous and farinaceous kind of the vegetable cla&s;s, than to tho&s;e abounding with oil, or ani|mal &s;ub&s;tances; becau&s;e, from heat, they are apt to grow rancid, acquire acrimony, and hence become too &s;timulant, and much increa&s;e the febrile effects we wi&s;h to re&s;train.</P>
<P>The catalogue of EMOLLIENTS furni&s;hes us with a great vari|ety of &s;ub&s;tances, out of which we form the following &s;election&mdash;which, as they are &s;o very &s;imple in their own nature, and produce no powerful action in the habit when taken internally, require not to have any particular do&s;es annexed to them.</P>

<P>The&s;e form the cla&s;s, it has been &s;aid, of medicines which act upon the inert &s;olids by means of the vital principle. That a&s;|tringents and emollients may act upon the inert &s;olids al&s;o, per|haps, without the aid of that principle, in many ca&s;es, when brought into contact with them, may be allowed&mdash;but that in the living machine they do, is much to be di&s;puted&mdash;and that the nutrients cannot, is evidently clear; for if that principle is defective by which the nutritious matter is applied to particular parts for their &s;upport and reparation, the matter it&s;elf will a|vail but little. This &s;eems clear from our ob&s;ervations on pa|ralytic limbs, receiving &s;uch &s;light degrees of &s;upport, and of be|ing &s;carce at all benefited by the application of a&s;tringents or emollients, where &s;uch deficiency takes place. However, in a work of this nature it &s;eems not nece&s;&s;ary to go too minutely in|to a &s;ubject of &s;o much intricacy; it is enough for our purpo&s;e to point out effects produced by the particular materials &s;pecified, without being very &s;olicitous of inve&s;tigating the preci&s;e mode by which they are accompli&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. On MEDICINES which act upon the LIVING SOLIDS by Means of the SAME PRINCIPLES.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t of which are,</P>
<P N="1"> &sect; 1. STIMULANTS, &s;o called from the Latin word <HI>&s;timulo,</HI> to prick or goad:&mdash;and the&s;e are all &s;uch medicines as increa&s;e the o&s;cillatory or vibrating motion of a fibre, or excite the action of the moving fibres in the living animals.</P>
<P>How &s;timulus increa&s;es action we cannot point out the pre|ci&s;e mode; but this we know, that all tho&s;e things which can increa&s;e the influence of the vital powers, either diffu&s;ively or partially, are real &s;timulants, and as &s;uch mu&s;t be con&s;ider|ed.</P>
<P>They have been concluded to be of two kinds&mdash;DIRECT and INDIRECT. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> are imagined to act directly on the mov|ing fibres;&mdash;the <HI>&s;econd</HI> on the organs of &s;en&s;e, by which means a perception is excited on the common &s;en&s;orium, which acting there, determines the nervous power to flow more copiou&s;ly in|to
<PB N="144" REF="028021_0140_0FD670DB12EA29C0">
the whole, or particular parts of the &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e are the mo&s;t common and univer&s;al. But &s;timulants do excite motion in the moving fibres them&s;elves independent of any connection with the common &s;en&s;orium; for if the heart, or &s;ome other of the mu&s;cular parts, are &s;eparated from the body, they may have their action excited by the application of particular &s;timuli: this then is a certain proof of an irritable power inherent in them&s;elves independent of connection with any nervous power. <HI>And again,</HI> it is as clear; that a &s;timulus applied to the &s;tomach will diffu&s;e its power to the whole habit; or if to a part, other parts far di&s;tant will experience its influence, as in ca&s;es of ge|neral heat being occa&s;ioned by the u&s;e of cordials or volatile &s;ub|&s;tances&mdash;vomiting from irritation of the kidneys, &amp;c. Hence then we may fairly conclude, that action is produced by &s;ympa|thy, as well as local &s;timulus.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, in many of the&s;e actions, mental power is the fir&s;t cau&s;e, as we may di&s;cover in longings, de&s;ire for that food of which we &s;ee others eating with uncommon reli&s;h; by which means the &s;tomach is &s;timulated, and a &s;trong &s;en&s;ation of hun|ger is induced, which did not before exi&s;t&mdash;weeping al&s;o from &s;orrow,&mdash;vomiting and &s;ickne&s;s from recollection and reflection, &amp;c. The&s;e are inconte&s;table proofs of the truth of our a&s;&s;er|tions.</P>
<P>Hence, then, &s;timulants may be properly divided into three cla&s;&s;es:</P>
<P>GENERAL&mdash;and the&s;e are &s;uch materials as are taken into the &s;tomach, and communicate general affection through the &s;y&s;tem, owing to the connection of that organ with every other part of the machine.</P>
<P>LOCAL&mdash;where irritation is produced on the part affected.</P>
<P>MENTAL&mdash;where, without the application of any material &s;ub|&s;tances, applied to the &s;tomach, or any other part, &s;imilar affec|tions will be produced by the powers of the mind.</P>
<P>Indeed, almo&s;t all active medicines might be ranked under the head of &s;timulants, were we to cla&s;s them according to their known operations; &s;ubmitted to different divi&s;ions under this general term, agreeable to the effects they produce&mdash;but we &s;hall confine our&s;elves to &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as invigorate the &s;y&s;tem, increa&s;e the action of the nervous and va&s;cular power locally or univer&s;ally,</P>
<P>And from hence &s;hall we &s;ee their u&s;e, by facilitating the pa&s;|&s;age of the blood through the parts in which it moved too &s;low, or was morbidly ob&s;tructed by augmenting the force and celeri|ty of the circulation&mdash;they quicken the &s;en&s;es where morbidly affected, rou&s;e the mental faculties when in a lethargic &s;tate, and exhilirate a de&s;ponding condition.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="028021_0141_0FD6711546991640">
They re&s;tore the powers of motion where morbidly defective, and al&s;o the &s;trength of motion where morbidly weak.</P>
<P>From their u&s;es have they been divided by &s;ome authors into &s;uch as are diffu&s;able&mdash;cordial&mdash;and topical by their action&mdash;that is, &s;uch as have their action conveyed over the &s;y&s;tem&mdash;&s;uch as exhilirate the &s;pirits&mdash;and &s;uch as are applied to &s;ome particu|lar parts morbidly affected.

<P>All the NUTRIENTS and ASTRINGENTS are of this cla&s;s; and many others of the &s;ucceeding cla&s;&s;es, though &s;timulant, are more particularly appropriated to other purpo&s;es, under which heads they will be arranged. The catalogue here given will be &s;uffi|cient to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es to which &s;timulants, merely con&s;i|dered as &s;uch, are calculated to be of any u&s;e.</P>
<P>But as &s;ome of them have been thought, by very re&s;pectable authority, to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome peculiar powers, and are ea&s;ily attaina|ble, we &s;hall beg leave to &s;pecify them.</P>
<P>HYSSOP has been reputed to be attenuant, re&s;olvent, pecto|ral, in coughs and a&s;thmas occa&s;ioned by vi&s;cid phlegm; thought to produce expectoration, drank in form of tea, and &s;weetened with honey; and to have the power of promoting the men&s;es attributed to it.</P>
<P>GROUND-IVY, drank in the &s;ame form, or in decoction, has been e&s;teemed corroborant, aperient, and detergent, u&s;ed al&s;o in coughs and a&s;thmas, to attenuate vi&s;cid phlegm and mucus, and to brace and &s;trengthen the ve&s;&s;els of the lungs; formerly much ordered in con&s;umptive ca&s;es, and ulcers of the kidneys, as an efficacious remedy.</P>
<P>PENNYROYAL. This has been con&s;idered cordial&mdash;of great u&s;e in hy&s;teric ca&s;es&mdash;to increa&s;e the tone of the &s;y&s;tem&mdash;and the chief vehicle for other medicines, to which were attributed the power of promoting the monthly di&s;charges of the female &s;ex. Indeed, in this la&s;t ca&s;e, by &s;ome practitioners, it is held in no little e&s;timation.</P>
<P>SPEAR-MINT. To this has been a&s;&s;igned cordial virtues, and a powerful re&s;trainer of vomiting&mdash;tea made of this herb often an&s;wering this purpo&s;e, where every other effort has failed. It is recommended in flatulent ca&s;es, fluxes, worm ca&s;es, and ma|ny other di&s;orders; and, though con&s;idered as a &s;timulant, it is not heating, a peculiar advantage it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es over many other of the cordial cla&s;s. Pepper-mint &s;eems al&s;o to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame power.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="028021_0143_0FD67118CD1C4ED8">
HEDGE-HYSSOP. This is named a hydragogue, or an e|vacuator of watery humours from the body&mdash;hence u&s;eful in drop&s;ical ca&s;es, and al&s;o worms, from its purgative power. In &s;ub&s;tance it is &s;aid to promote vomiting, &s;weat, and urine, to be of &s;ervice in maniacal and venereal ca&s;es, after mercury had been given freely without effect&mdash;the do&s;e, in powder, from 10 to 30 grains.</P>
<P>DANDELION. This has been con&s;idered as peculiarly u&s;e|ful in vi&s;ceral ob&s;tructions, particularly tho&s;e of the liver, as it &s;eems calculated from its &s;timulant deob&s;truent powers, to pro|mote bilious di&s;charges&mdash;and, from experience, has been conclud|ed highly efficacious in all biliary infarctions of the liver.</P>
<P>WAKE ROBIN. Much has been &s;aid by men of the fir&s;t medical authority in favour of this medicine, and u&s;ed to be re|commended as promoting watery excretions, quickening circu|lation in cold phlegmatic habits, and in di&s;ea&s;es from vi&s;cid phlegm.</P>
<P>In deep &s;eated, fixed rheumatic pains, it has been given with &s;ucce&s;s, in do&s;es of from ten grains to a &s;cruple of the fre&s;h root two or three times a day.</P>
<P>GEOFFROY and BERGIUS &s;peak highly of its powers, as re|&s;toring lo&s;t appetite, curing intermittents. In the jaundice, green|&s;ickne&s;s, hy&s;terical, hypochondriacal, and other di&s;ea&s;es, it has been found u&s;eful. In ca&s;es al&s;o of ob&s;tinate head-achs, which return at intervals, without fever, mixed with alkaline aromatics and ab&s;orbents. It is given in the following manner:</P>
<P>Take powder of wake robin, vitriolated tartar, of each ten grains powdered rhubarb, five grains. If the&s;e purge too vio|lently, the quantity of the arum may be le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>GEOFFROY u&s;ed to give it in do&s;es of from half a dram to a dram; and by being boiled in vinegar, he &s;ays it becomes pow|erfully diuretic.</P>
<P>LEWIS gives from ten grains to a &s;cruple of the fre&s;h root twice or thrice a day, made into a bolus, or emul&s;ion with oily, or mucilaginous &s;ub&s;tances&mdash;it generally produced, whil&s;t the pa|tient was warm in bed, a copious &s;weat. It is now kept in the &s;hops made into a con&s;erve, half a dram of which may be given as a do&s;e, and gradually increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus much has it been thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay of &s;timulants, in order to furni&s;h a general idea of their exten&s;ive utility, under proper management; but as their u&s;es are &s;o multifarious, and almo&s;t the whole catalogue become repeatedly under our con&s;i|deration in the &s;ucceeding part of this work, wherein we &s;hall-be more particular in the &s;pecification of their do&s;es, and the pecu|liar

<P>Though there certainly appears a difference between &s;pa&s;m and convul&s;ion, as they never run one into the other; yet there have been many di&s;putes relative to the definition, &s;o that their di&s;|tinctions may be properly marked.</P>
<P>Some have &s;aid, if the &s;olids are drawn into involuntary con|tractions, and they do not continue long, but go off, and frequent|ly return again, the&s;e affections are termed <HI>convul&s;ions</HI>&mdash;but if they remain a con&s;iderable time, <HI>&s;pa&s;ms.</HI></P>
<P>GAUBIUS defines a &s;pa&s;m, a violent, involutary, inordinate ac|tion of the moving fibres; and &s;ays, they who di&s;tingui&s;h a &s;pa&s;m from convul&s;ion, call the fir&s;t a continued, the latter an alternate contraction of the mu&s;cles.</P>

<P>Though this di&s;tinction is nece&s;&s;ary to be known, for the bet|ter under&s;tanding the authors who have written &s;y&s;tematically on the &s;ubject; yet &s;till it will be of little u&s;e in a practical view; as we &s;hall find, according to the cau&s;e, what will be u&s;eful in one &s;pecies, will al&s;o in the other. Indeed, there are &s;uch a variety of cau&s;es, &s;o very different in their own nature, which may produce &s;pa&s;modic or convul&s;ive affections, that there will nece&s;&s;arily appear to be a great diver&s;ity of medicines which ought to be ranked un|der this head.</P>
<P>SPASMS ari&s;ing from laxity, are removed by <HI>a&s;tringents;</HI> from an over di&s;ten&s;ion, by <HI>emollients,</HI> from acrimony, by <HI>demulcents,</HI> or &s;uch medicines as &s;heath the offending particles; from acidity in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, by <HI>ab&s;orbent,</HI> or <HI>alcale&s;cent &s;ub&s;tances,</HI> which, by uniting with the acid, form a third &s;ub&s;tance, inoffen&s;ive in its action, and thus remove the cau&s;e; from wind, by tho&s;e ma|terials which di&s;per&s;e wind by their &s;timulating powers, and are called <HI>curminatives;</HI> from worms, by tho&s;e &s;tiled <HI>anthelmintics,</HI> or de&s;troyers or evacuators of them, &amp;c.&mdash;but the&s;e are con&s;i|dered, in regard to their known action, under their re&s;pective heads, calculated to operate again&s;t, and remove the acting cau&s;e.

<P>RUE has been recommended in ca&s;es where vi&s;cid phlegm has abounded, and the circulation of the blood been languid. As an attenuant, re&s;olvent, and deob&s;truent it has been much extoll|ed; al&s;o in hy&s;terical ca&s;es; and as a promoter of the men&s;trual di&s;charge. BOERHAAVE had the highe&s;t opinion of it. CUL|LEN &s;ays, it is certainly an u&s;eful medicine. It is be&s;t given in con&s;erve, from half a dram to half an ounce, two or three times a day.</P>
<P>SABINE. This is con&s;idered as a warm aperient medicine, increa&s;ing glandular &s;ecretions, and a powerful promoter of the men&s;es. It is a very heating and acrid &s;ub&s;tance, and therefore requires much caution in the admini&s;tration. Dr. CULLEN thinks it more powerfully determines to the uterus than any o|ther medicine&mdash;of which truth experience has often convinced
<PB N="151" REF="028021_0147_0FD6711B85FD7E38">
me. Dr. HOME, out of five patients labouring under ob&s;truc|tions of the men&s;trual di&s;charge, cured three, or rather four, by giving half a dram of the powder twice a day, though a dram is the do&s;e commonly recommended. Of the extract, from &s;ix to twenty grains is a do&s;e. Externally applied, it has been e|&s;teemed a powerful de&s;troyer of fungous excre&s;cences, in taking of venereal warts, where other applications have failed.</P>
<P N="3"> &sect; 3. SEDATIVES. This is derived from the Latin word <HI>&s;edo,</HI> to a&s;&s;uage, re&s;t, calm; and they properly belong to &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as dimini&s;h motion in the &s;y&s;tem, and the force of the moving powers&mdash;and al&s;o alleviate pain.</P>
<P>Hence, whatever dimini&s;hes motion in a part, or in the whole of the &s;y&s;tem, whether by rendering it in&s;en&s;ible to any painful &s;timulus, or by arre&s;ting, by any means, the impul&s;e of the vi|tal powers, may be called &s;edative. All medicines, therefore, which cool the habit, or take off inflammation&mdash;&s;ome of the acids&mdash;neutral &s;alts&mdash;emollients&mdash;a&s;tringents&mdash;and anti&s;pa&s;modics, may properly come under this head, as they dimini&s;h motion in the &s;y&s;tem&mdash;but in this place our objects are limited to the con|&s;ideration of &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances only as are thought particularly to act on the nervous power.</P>
<P>With regard to the preci&s;e mode of action of tho&s;e &s;elected to form this cla&s;s, we can &s;ay very little, as our knowledge of the nervous &s;y&s;tem is &s;o incomplete. However, thus far we may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that they act either by having a peculiar power of re&s;training the violence, or rendering more equal the irregular motions of the nervous power, by their influence on the common &s;en&s;orium, and its appendages primarily, (56) or by blunting the irritability of the living &s;olids, and thus preventing the &s;ame power from exerci&s;ing too forcibly its influence. And this they do either &s;ympathetically, by having their action more diffu&s;ively communicated from the part they fir&s;t affect; or by the locality of their action, when they are applied to the parts them&s;elves; for it has been proved, that the heart taken out of the body, has been made to act by the application of &s;ome &s;ti|mulus, and con&s;equently, that this power of contraction was de|pendent on &s;omething foreign to the influence of the common &s;en&s;orium, or nerves, which was certainly inherent in the mu&s;|cular fibres them&s;elves; and if opium is di&s;&s;olved and thrown upon the heart &s;o &s;eparated from the machine, no action from &s;ti|mulus will take place&mdash;which proves, that, by means of this &s;e|dative &s;olution, irritability is de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>And it is commonly known, that if a &s;mall do&s;e of opium be taken on the &s;tomach, it will alleviate pains of the extremities,
<PB N="152" REF="028021_0148_0FD67159E2536638">
and other parts di&s;tant from that organ, very expeditiou&s;ly, as well as procure &s;leep.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> then we take the influence &s;edatives have on the common &s;en&s;orium, and the irritable power, inherent in the mu&s;cular fi|bres of the &s;y&s;tem, we &s;hall be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t certain known idea of the operation of medicines of this cla&s;s; and be furni&s;hed with the knowledge <HI>where, how far,</HI> and <HI>in what mode,</HI> the ap|plication of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances may be &s;erviceable, or hurtful, in &s;o far as they act as &s;edatives; but it mu&s;t al&s;o be remembered, that &s;ome of them are &s;timulants.</P>
<P>Hence then, in all ca&s;es where there is too great a rapidity in the circulating fluids, or pain, or &s;pa&s;m from an inflammatory cau&s;e, they would be hurtful, otherwi&s;e they are in general &s;er|viceable. In ca&s;es al&s;o of infarction, or &s;trong ob&s;truction, which &s;ometimes happens in the lungs, though attended with &s;pa&s;ms, they mu&s;t be cautiou&s;ly u&s;ed. But where neither of the&s;e ob|jections occur, they may be allowable, and attended with u&s;e in dimini&s;hing the force and celerity of the blood's motion, where morbidly augmented, or the impetus of the blood again&s;t parts &s;imilarly affected, in abating violent pain, and procuring &s;leep ill ca&s;es of preternatural watchfulne&s;s, in re&s;training inor|dinate motions, and moderating exce&s;&s;ive evacuations.</P>
<P>But where the circulation is preternaturally languid, or there is a lethargic or drow&s;y di&s;po&s;ition, or a high degree of torpor in the &s;y&s;tem, to them in the&s;e ca&s;es we &s;hould not have re|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>According to the purpo&s;es they have been given to effect, they have received different appellations&mdash;if to alleviate pain, <HI>anodyne;</HI> if to abate it by their demulcent power, <HI>paregoric;</HI> if by bring|ing on &s;tupor, <HI>narcotic;</HI> if by inducing &s;leep, <HI>hypnotic;</HI> howe|ver, their action is &s;imilar, and requires no &s;uch di&s;tinction. They are more properly divided into &s;uch as produce &s;leep, as opium, henbane, poppy; and &s;uch as alleviate from their cool|ing property, as neutral &s;alts, acids.</P>

Of all the&s;e medicines, however, we think it nece&s;&s;ary to give a more particular account&mdash;and, fir&s;t,</P>
<P>The POPPY HEAD is in u&s;e for making a &s;yrup, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of virtues to relieve pain, and procure &s;leep&mdash;for the&s;e purpo&s;es, it is chiefly given to children, in do&s;es of from half a &s;cruple to half a dram or more; and it will be efficacious &s;ometimes, where opium and its preparations are apt to di&s;agree with the con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o u&s;ed for making fomentations for alleviating pain, particularly after proper evacuations in inflammations of the eyes and brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>OPIUM is <HI>anodyne,</HI> from its relieving mo&s;t painful affections&mdash;<HI>hypnotic,</HI> from procuring &s;leep&mdash;<HI>incra&s;&s;ant,</HI> from thickening the humours&mdash;<HI>diaphoretic,</HI> from increa&s;ing per&s;piration; and, joined with ipecacuanha, antimonials, camphor, volatile &s;alts, and &s;uch like, the mo&s;t powerfully &s;o of any medicine with which we are acquainted&mdash;<HI>&s;edative,</HI> from allaying the too great irritability of the nervous &s;y&s;tem&mdash;and the mo&s;t efficacious <HI>anti|&s;pa&s;modic</HI> in the materia medica;&mdash;taken in too large quantity, it renders the nervous &s;y&s;tem &s;o totally in&s;en&s;ible, produces &s;uch general relaxations, that lethargy, convul&s;ions, and death, are the con&s;equences; but, in a variety of ca&s;es, given judiciou&s;ly, it is one of our mo&s;t noble remedies, particularly where ner|vous incitability, or thinne&s;s or acrimony of the humours are too prevalent in the con&s;titution, admit too great degree of fe|ver, or heat, or fixed ob&s;tructions, do not contra-indicate its u&s;e.</P>
<P>Hence the benefit ari&s;ing from its admini&s;tration in hy&s;teric and hypochondriac di&s;ea&s;es; in convul&s;ions from violent pain; in too great watchfulne&s;s, at the latter end of fevers, &s;mall-pox, and mea&s;les; in coughs, from acrid, &s;timulating defluxions; in loo&s;ene&s;s, and dy&s;enteric complaints, called bloody fluxes, very often. It has been &s;aid to cure the venereal di&s;ea&s;e. That in ir|ritable habits it a&s;&s;i&s;ts the operation of mercury, by preventing the too powerful exertions of mercurial &s;timulus, alleviating pain, and promoting in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, will not be denied, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it
<PB N="154" REF="028021_0150_0FD671600ED83F48">
being of it&s;elf curative, I cannot believe&mdash;though, after the hu|mours have been rendered too thin and acrimonious by the u&s;e of mercury, I will not di&s;pute its power; for I have &s;een its good effects in totally removing what have been called rheu|matic pains from that &s;ource.</P>
<P>A&s;a-foetida joined with opium is &s;aid to weaken its narcotic effects, and prevent that &s;tupor, heavine&s;s, and vertiginous affec|tions, which opium is apt to occa&s;ion after its operation.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this medicine not only alleviates pain, and takes off &s;pa&s;modic affections, when admini&s;tered internally&mdash;but when applied externally, as in fomentations, catapla&s;ms, lotions, lini|ments, or injections, it produces the &s;ame con&s;equences.</P>
<P>HEMLOCK has been u&s;ed much in &s;crophulous, &s;chirrous, and cancerous ca&s;es;&mdash;in the la&s;t highly recommended by Dr. Storck, as a &s;ucce&s;sful medicine, though not an&s;wering the expectations of the phy&s;icians of this country; notwith&s;tanding which, I he|&s;itate not to declare, I have found it in &s;ome degree &s;erviceable in &s;chirro&s;ity&mdash;in &s;crophulous tumours, joined with bark, it has been u&s;eful; as al&s;o in ulcers, and foulne&s;s of the bones from that cau&s;e; in &s;ome ob&s;tinate rheumatic ca&s;es it has been effica|cious, and I have evidently &s;een it produce good effects in the chin|cough. Joined with mercury, it has been u&s;eful in venereal complaints, and has been &s;ucce&s;sfully given in &s;ome cutaneous di&s;orders.</P>
<P>It is commonly given in do&s;es from four or five grains to a &s;cruple, and pu&s;hed on to one or two drams in twenty-four hours half an ounce has been given in that time; and, in one or two ca&s;es, Dr. MONRO &s;ays, he has known an ounce. However, Dr. CULLEN remarks, and that with great propriety, that if &s;ome &s;en&s;ible effect is not perceived, when the do&s;e is about twenty grains, he &s;hould di&s;pute the goodne&s;s of the medicine, and have recour&s;e to different parcels of it.</P>
<P>HENBANE. This has been con&s;idered as a narcotic, not pro|ducing heat like opium; and, be&s;ides, it is, in large do&s;es, laxa|tive&mdash;evident advantages over opium. In palpitations of the heart, it has been &s;aid to be u&s;eful&mdash;in ca&s;es of mania and con|vul&s;ions, in do&s;es of the extract from one grain to five. Though STORCK extols the remedy in &s;pa&s;modic affections, and profu&s;e bleedings; yet, from Dr. HOME's experience, it appears in the&s;e affections not to produce any good effects. It &s;eldom produces &s;leep, or alleviates pain, except till the do&s;e is arrived at eight or ten grains, nay, often it has been obliged to be increa&s;ed to fifteen or twenty; though, in full do&s;es, it is more apt to occa|&s;ion delirium than opium. Sometimes it will agree where opi|um
<PB N="155" REF="028021_0151_0FD6711EE97CE920">
will not; and it is not, except in large do&s;es, that its aperi|ent effects are very remarkable.</P>
<P>From a ca&s;e related by Sauvages of its curing a cataract. I once, under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, tried it with evident utility; but during the trial, my patient left town, nor have I heard what was the ultimate re&s;ult However, &s;uch were its effects under my in&s;pection, that I &s;hould, in all ca&s;es of recent cataractous ap|pearances, recommend the trial.</P>
<P>TOBACCO, though in common u&s;e, and certainly con&s;idered as a luxury, from being chewed, taken in &s;nuff, and &s;moked for plea&s;ure, is a deleterious and noxious herb, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;trongly of tho&s;e powers producing &s;tupor; hence con&s;idered as a narcotic. It is highly &s;timulant, a powerful emetic, purgative, and promot|er of the &s;alivary di&s;charge;&mdash;applied by way of poultice to the &s;tomach, we are told it excites vomiting, and produces the &s;ame effects applied to wounds. In the iliac pa&s;&s;ion, incarcerated rup|tures, and ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s, thrown up into the bowels, by way of &s;moke, or in &s;trong infu&s;ion, it has proved efficacious&mdash;and al&s;o in ca&s;es of worms, particularly tho&s;e very &s;mall white worms, called <HI>a&s;carides,</HI> which affect the lower part of the large bowel, called rectum, occa&s;ioning itching in the anus:&mdash;Indeed, it is &s;aid that no remedy is more powerful in opening the bowels, procuring &s;tools, and in de&s;troying and bringing away the&s;e worms than this&mdash;though it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that given in this me|thod, it will often produce great &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting, e&s;peci|ally if pu&s;hed far into the inte&s;tinal canal.</P>
<P>In Sweden it is a dome&s;tic medicine, and often given to vomit and purge, in the beginning of putrid fevers. An extract made of it, which renders it more mild in its operation, has long been u&s;ed in Germany as a pectoral in coughs&mdash;and, of late, in this country, recommended as a powerful diuretic, and of great u&s;e in drop&s;ies;&mdash;but its inefficacy in &s;mall do&s;es, and from its pro|ducing &s;evere &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting, in large ones, &s;uch as were &s;ufficient to make its diuretic effect apparent&mdash;from the nau&s;e|ou&s;ne&s;s of its preparations, and the roughne&s;s of its action; it has not yet been brought into general u&s;e internally. External|ly applied, BERGIUS con&s;iders it as efficacious in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing that tumefaction of the prepuce (55) called phymo&s;is.</P>
<P N="4"> &sect; 4. ERRHINES. This cla&s;s of medicines, &s;o called from the Greek <HI>en</HI> in, and <HI>rin</HI> na&s;um, the no&s;e, or STERNUTATO|RIES, from producing &s;neezing, are all &s;uch as &s;timulate the in|ternal membrane of the no&s;e, occa&s;ioning a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low of mucus from thence, or cau&s;ing that action from whence they derive their name.</P>
<P>They act altogether by their &s;timulus; and though they have
<PB N="156" REF="028021_0152_0FD6716248809AF0">
been &s;aid to have effect upon the fluids, they do it in other way, than by increa&s;ing the action of the &s;olids on their continued li|quids. Indeed all evacuants are general &s;timulants. Even the&s;e medicines carried into the &s;tomach, or thrown upon other parts of the machine, would produce &s;uch effects as were con&s;i&s;tent with their irritating power, and might vomit, produce gentle &s;weat, or urine, or become expectorant, according to their elec|tive properties.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of the&s;e medicines, though much in&s;i&s;ted on by the ancients, have, by the moderns, fallen into neglect, though they may in &s;ome ca&s;es certainly be of no &s;mall &s;ervice, either in un|loading the parts contiguous to the no&s;e, or removing ob&s;truc|tions by the &s;hocks given to the &s;y&s;tem in &s;neezing.</P>

<P>From con&s;idering the operation of the&s;e medicines, and the effects likely to be produc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d by the application, we may learn how they become u&s;eful in rheumatic affections of the head; for temporary relief has not only been acquired by them, but the rheumatic di&s;po&s;ition conquered&mdash;the tooth-ach al&s;o, and other rheumatic affections.

<P N="5"> &sect; 5. SIALAGOGUES&mdash;derived from the Greek words, <HI>&s;ialon,</HI> &s;aliva, and <HI>ago duco,</HI> to draw forth, comprehend all &s;uch medicines as produce a &s;low of &s;aliva into the mouth, from the glands named &s;alivary, there &s;ituated.</P>
<P>They have been divided by &s;ome authors into three cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The FIRST&mdash;&s;uch as immediately act upon the&s;e glands, as fomentation, friction, and &s;uction, either internal or external of the&s;e parts;&mdash;hence, moreover, catapla&s;ms applied to tho&s;e glands, called parotid, from their &s;ituation under the ear, and chewing tobacco moi&s;ten the mouth;&mdash;all pungent &s;timulants al&s;o.</P>
<P>The SECOND, are all &s;uch as occa&s;ion a flow of &s;aliva into the mouth, by intercepting a flux of moi&s;ture into other parts; for it is ob&s;ervable, that if any of the vi&s;cera &s;hould be ob&s;tructed, as the liver, &s;pleen, pancreas, at the &s;ame time the kidneys, or inte&s;tinal ducts, then is the mouth always moi&s;t&mdash;whence hypo|chondriac people are called SPUTATORES, from their &s;pitting &s;o much; and, therefore, whatever prevents a &s;ecretion of lymph in tho&s;e places, &s;hould be e&s;teemed &s;ialagogue.</P>
<P>The THIRD CLASS takes in all tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances which <HI>are &s;uppo&s;|ed to break down the &s;anguinary ma&s;s,</HI> and by that means &s;upply the mouth with too great a proportion of fluids, thus di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>Of this tribe quick&s;ilver is the principal, and may be applied in various modes.</P>
<P>From its external application a &s;alivation may be rai&s;ed, though in its crude &s;tate&mdash;but it may be applied in form of liniment or fumigation; for if twelve grains of quick&s;ilver are placed upon a fire, or a heated iron, they will emit a &s;moke, which, received by the no&s;trils, in two or three days will occa&s;ion a &s;pitting. It may be taken internally with the &s;ame intent, and &s;ucceed, if given in a &s;mall quantity; but if in too large, it is apt to pa&s;s off by the bowels; if handled much, and for a long continuance, &s;imilar effects will be produced, as we learn from gold-beaters, who make great u&s;e of quick&s;ilver, falling into &s;alivations.</P>
<P>Quick&s;ilver formed into a &s;alt by &s;ublimation, if taken in &s;mall do&s;es, if applied externally to wounds or ulcers, or if attracted by the no&s;e, has &s;imilar con&s;equences, from its reception into the habit.</P>
<P>It was the opinion of BOERHAAVE and others, that all the&s;e effects were produced by di&s;&s;olving the fluids, either by its me|chanical action, or by its di&s;&s;olving or putre&s;cent power.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="028021_0155_0FD67126F88AF5D8">
Had not the&s;e doctrines been previou&s;ly refuted by &s;uch argu|ments as are uncontrovertible, from the con&s;iderations, that me|chanical force never divides mixts, but aggregates only; that, from the minutene&s;s of the divi&s;ion of gold, even it may be made to become incapable of overcoming the cohe&s;ion of water or &s;pi|rit of wine, and be &s;u&s;pended in them&mdash;and al&s;o that the &s;mall|ne&s;s of the quantity introduced would be inadequate to produce the effect. And, <HI>with</HI> regard <HI>to its di&s;&s;olvent or putre&s;cent power,</HI> that, during the operation of quick&s;ilver on the habit, no &s;ymp|toms of putre&s;cency appear in any part of the &s;y&s;tem&mdash;that there is no alteration of the blood in that re&s;pect during a &s;alivation, but its texture appears as &s;trong then as at any other time;&mdash;that &s;alivation is attended with an inflammation, and the blood &s;hews an inflammatory cru&s;t; and, <HI>finally,</HI> that after the opera|tion of the &s;alivation is over, no taint appears in the blood, but, on the contrary, the per&s;on is in better health than before, and gives marks of a firmer &s;tate of it;&mdash;one &s;ingle in&s;tance would be &s;ufficient to overturn them, if we con&s;ider that a few grains of calomel has in many con&s;titutions rai&s;ed a &s;alivation very &s;ud|denly, which has continued for &s;ome days, nay weeks. In&s;tanc|es of which have fallen within the cour&s;e of my own ob&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>I cannot my&s;elf doubt of its producing its action in the &s;aliva|ry glands by the means of its elective &s;timulus, though it is ca|pable of exerting its &s;timulus in other parts of the machine, as on the &s;tomach, inte&s;tines, kidneys, and per&s;piratory ve&s;&s;els, pro|ducing, according to the parts affected, vomiting, purging, di&s;|charge of urine, and gentle per&s;piration.</P>
<P>Indeed, upon the whole, it &s;hould be con&s;idered as a &s;timulant in general, in particular, a &s;alivary one, and an evacuant, more peculiarly of the &s;erous or lymphatic fluid, or both; and one of the mo&s;t univer&s;al aperients and deob&s;truents we have in the whole catalogue of the materia medica.</P>
<P>In its combined &s;tate, forming metallic &s;alts, quick&s;ilver &s;ooner exerts its activity on the &s;y&s;tem, but le&s;s certain, I think, in its effects;&mdash;it appears more efficacious, having its parts only divided by &s;ome unctuous or oleagmous &s;ub&s;tances; and, per|haps, its virtue depends upon its being &s;o entirely unconquerable by the a&s;&s;imilating powers of the con&s;titution, and capable of &s;uch minute divi&s;ibility, for it will pa&s;s through any body except gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Quick&s;ilver, though here ranked as an internal &s;ialagogue, or a promoter of the excretion of &s;aliva, becau&s;e its elective power &s;eems to be more determined to the &s;alivary &s;y&s;tem, than any o|ther part of the machine, may fairly be con&s;idered as an univer|&s;al

&s;timulant, deob&s;truent, purgative, and general evacuant, in|crea&s;ing the whole of the excretions of the human body.</P>
<P>It was thought that, from the great di&s;charge it produced from the &s;alival glands, and the foetor accompanying it, that it di&s;&s;olv|ed the texture of the blood, and di&s;po&s;ed it into putrid acrimo|ny; but experience proves the ca&s;e to be far otherwi&s;e, as we have proved above.</P>
<P>The great effects produced by quick&s;ilver &s;eem to proceed from its increa&s;ing the whole of the animal excretions, and thus carrying off the virus of the pox, for the cure of which it is the mo&s;t remarkable and certain;&mdash;and, indeed, it has been, and &s;till continues to be, by many, con&s;idered for this di&s;ea&s;e a SPECIFIC;&mdash;but as it will not, by it&s;elf, in all ca&s;es, cure that complaint, nor prevent the venereal poi&s;on from taking effect, even in con|&s;titutions loaded with it, that idea mu&s;t fall to the ground.</P>
<P>Though quick&s;ilver, in its original &s;tate, is inactive re&s;pecting the human machine, and only has been given in this &s;tate to con|quer ob&s;tinate ob&s;tructions of the inte&s;tines, though inefficaciou&s;|ly, &s;till from mechanical divi&s;ion, as united with vi&s;cid, oleagi|nous, or unctuous &s;ub&s;tances, rubbed down with dry powder calcined, or united with different acids, forming mercurial &s;alts, it has been rendered extremely active; and though preparations of this abound, the chief u&s;e are confined to a few.</P>

<P>Indeed calomel, and &s;ome other of the active preparations, have proved efficacious in the early &s;tages of inflammatory com|plaints of the brea&s;t, brain, pleura, &amp;c. when g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">n freely, in repeated do&s;es, &s;ometimes with, &s;ometimes without opi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> which has been, in the&s;e ca&s;es, rendered more effectual by joining &s;mall do&s;es of the antimonial powder along with it.

<P>But when there appears to be an uncommon determination to the &s;alivary glands&mdash;any praeternatural &s;en&s;ibility in the glands&mdash;when the &s;erous part in the circulatory fluids is defective&mdash;or there is a high degree of inanition, or general debility of the &s;y&s;|tem, we mu&s;t avoid u&s;ing them.</P>

<P>To promote which purpo&s;e, &s;everal particulars are nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved. It is required, FIRST, <HI>that</HI> the matter contained within them &s;hould be rendered moveable, and capable of being expectorated, taking care that the mo&s;t fluid part &s;hould not be di&s;&s;ipated, le&s;t the remainder &s;hould be le&s;t too vi&s;cid, and not ea&s;ily pumped up from the lungs;&mdash;hence medicines to heating and &s;timulating are hurtful;&mdash;SECOND, <HI>that</HI> the pa&s;&s;ages of the lungs &s;hould be open, clean&s;ed, and lubricated;&mdash;THIRD, <HI>that</HI> the excretion of the offending matter &s;hould be promoted, which is be&s;t performed by coughing, to which end proper &s;timulus, and proportionate &s;trength are required;&mdash;FOURTHLY, <HI>that</HI> the ob&s;tructed ve&s;&s;els &s;hould have re&s;t, by which means they may be relaxed&mdash;for &s;hould they be continually irritated, the humour from the glands of the windpipe would be ejected with a &s;ort of pain.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h the FIRST intent, all aromatic bitters, and, at the &s;ame time, mild oleaginous &s;ub&s;tances are nece&s;&s;ary, &s;uch as hore-hound, hy&s;&s;op, elecampane, pennyroyal, valerian, &amp;c. and &s;ulphureous medicines mixed with alkalies&mdash;all fixed &s;aponace|ous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> or mixed with milk;&mdash;all

<P>For the THIRD are u&s;eful all tho&s;e which excite a cough, as wine, vinegar, acrid &s;pirits, &s;ternutatories, &s;quills, gum ammo|niac, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And, for the LAST, demulcents, anodynes, and narcotics, are proper, of which the principal is opium; for when the windpipe is once excoriated, it is ea&s;ily thrown into violent &s;pa&s;ms, and cough, which cannot be re&s;trained by that powerful &s;edative.</P>
<P>However, we may in general ob&s;erve, where there is no in|flammatory tendency, and the moving powers are torpid, &s;ome of the &s;tronger &s;timulants are extremely u&s;eful, and are the things which chiefly contribute to promote expectoration; but they &s;hould be very cautiou&s;ly u&s;ed in di&s;ea&s;es of the brea&s;t, and particular care taken, that the habit be free from any inflamma|tory di&s;po&s;ition, or, at lea&s;t that no inflammation is fixed there&mdash;for where the&s;e take place, relaxing the ve&s;&s;els, and taking off the &s;pa&s;ms is all that is wanted, for in &s;uch con&s;titutions the mucus it&s;elf &s;upplies &s;ufficient irritation, either from its acrimony or weight, or di&s;ten&s;ion of the cells of the lungs.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, the utility of expectorants appears&mdash;when the &s;ecretion of mucus in the lungs is obviou&s;ly dimi|ni&s;hed, by promoting that &s;ecretion, and rendering the mucus thinner, when too thick or vi&s;cid&mdash;where the excretion is in&s;uf|ficient, by evacuating morbid accumulations of mucus in the lungs, and &s;upplying irritation to that organ when defective.</P>
<P>When the lungs labour under a &s;tate of morbid in&s;en&s;ibility, by removing that, and promoting a free circulation through them, when it is there morbidly impeded.</P>
<P>But when there is a high degree of increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility in the lungs, and an uncommon quick excretion of mucus from them, the &s;timulant expectorants ought to be prohibited; and when there is too great a &s;tate of torpor, of the relaxing ones we &s;hould by no means make u&s;e.</P>

<P N="7">&sect; 7. EMETICS. This is a Greek word, from <HI>emeo,</HI> vomo, to vomit; by the Latins they are called <HI>vomitoria,</HI> and are all &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances which, by their action, cau&s;e the &s;tomach to re|ject its contents upwards.</P>
<P>The effects produced by this action have been divided into eight heads; in con&s;idering which we &s;hall be enabled to per|ceive the utility to be derived from the application of the&s;e re|medies; on which, as we go along, we &s;hall furni&s;h &s;ome remarks nece&s;&s;ary for the more clear elucidation of different parts of the &s;ubject;</P>
<P>FIRST. "Vomiting evacuates the contents of the &s;tomach it&s;elf; though it is not ea&s;y to know when that is fully perform|ed. Many have got into a method of promoting few repetitions in vomiting, and giving &s;mall ablutions; but it has by others been thought that frequent ablutions are required to clear the folds of various matters, or mucus, which may be detained with|in them."</P>
<P>If we wi&s;h to evacuate the contents of the &s;tomach complete|ly, frequent and copious ablutions are certainly right; but it is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to give gentle &s;hocks only to promote &s;ome particular purpo&s;es, and the&s;e mu&s;t be often repeated, &s;o that it would be hurtful to pu&s;h vomiting to its extent, as, from violent &s;training of that organ, it would become too relaxed, and our in|tent fru&s;trated; for it is from the repetition of the operation gent|ly, not from unloading the &s;tomach, &s;ucce&s;s is expected.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. "Vomiting cau&s;es a flow of liquids to the &s;to|mach, clears it, and emulges its mucus glands." And,</P>
<P>THIRDLY. "It not only emulges the mucus follicles of the &s;tomach, and promotes a flow of ga&s;tric liquor, but has the &s;ame effect on the neighbouring glands, e&s;pecially the &s;weetbread and the liver."</P>
<P>FOURTHLY. "Whil&s;t the vomiting continues, it not only in|verts the regular motion of the &s;tomach, called <HI>peri&s;taltic</HI> but al&s;o of the inte&s;tines, which pour out their mucus to be carried to the &s;tomach, and evacuated with its contents.</P>
<P>"Hence do we find vomits u&s;eful in loo&s;ene&s;&s;es and dy&s;ente|ries; but, independent of that, they are beneficial, more proba|bly, as purging the inte&s;tines, occa&s;ioning a greater flow of liquors into the inte&s;tinal canal. If the vomiting cea&s;es, the increa&s;ed &s;ecretion is carried off by &s;tool, &s;o that at any rate the adherent
<PB N="166" REF="028021_0162_0FD67169A103DBC8">
foulne&s;s is wa&s;hed away, by &s;queezing the tract of the inte&s;tines."</P>
<P>FIFTHLY. "Vomiting &s;queezes, and occa&s;ions a con&s;triction of the whole abdominal vi&s;cera, e&s;pecially the me&s;enteric glands, (46) and in con&s;equence pumps the whole Lymphatic &s;y&s;tem;&mdash;on this account increa&s;es ab&s;orption, as well as from its evacuat|ing property; hence for the&s;e purpo&s;es emetics an&s;wer equally well with purgatives, and may be u&s;eful in drop&s;ical ca&s;es."</P>
<P>But here we &s;hould be careful no &s;trong vi&s;ceral ob&s;tructions hath taken place, or any great acrimony in the humours, and ten|derne&s;s of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, for in the&s;e ca&s;es they may be productive of the mo&s;t fatal effects.</P>
<P>SIXTHLY. Dr. Cullen thinks, "vomiting has the power of affecting the kidneys, for as irritation of the kidney will produce vomiting, &s;o, on the other hand, it is rea&s;onable to think, that vomiting may al&s;o act upon the kidney&mdash;hence it would &s;eem u&s;eful in propelling &s;tones in the kidneys."</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding &s;ome have recour&s;e to &s;uch a practice, and it appears imitative of nature, &s;till I &s;hould conceive it <HI>almo&s;t always</HI> a dangerous experiment, <HI>always</HI> doubtful, and <HI>often</HI> not nece&s;&s;ary; for if the &s;tone &s;hould be &s;o impacted with the kidney that it cannot pa&s;s, irritation on the part would be &s;trongly increa&s;ed, of cour&s;e pain and inflammation in &s;imilar proportion, mo&s;t like|ly ab&s;ce&s;s, and their con&s;equences. Be&s;ides, we can never be certain whether the &s;tone is of &s;uch a &s;ize as to pa&s;s through the ureters (50) by any propul&s;ive force; and if it &s;hould, by relax|ing the ureters as much as we can, by proper remedies, we are more likely to produce the effect, and certain to avoid all danger from too ra&s;h a practice;&mdash;however, if the attempt at propul&s;ion was to be made, every means &s;hould be previou&s;ly u&s;ed to render the pa&s;&s;ages as di&s;ten&s;ible as po&s;&s;ible before the trial;&mdash;but of this we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to treat more fully in future.</P>
<P>SEVENTHLY. "But the effects are extended, perhaps, to the vi&s;cera of the che&s;t, as expectoration has been promoted by vo|miting."</P>
<P>EIGHTHLY. "It al&s;o increa&s;es the con&s;triction of the fauces, and forcibly emulges the whole of the &s;alivary glands. It has had the effect of tho&s;e medicines called ma&s;ticatories, which, by chewing and increa&s;ing a di&s;charge of &s;aliva, relieve rheumatic affections of the head, tooth-ach, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"By preventing in&s;piration, vomiting occa&s;ions a regurgita|tion of the blood at the end of expiration. The accumulating blood, which u&s;ually happens, produced by vomiting, is only mo|mentary, and may be &s;oon counterpoi&s;ed, as will be &s;een by con|&s;idering its advantageous effects on the &s;y&s;tem in general.</P>
<P>"During the time of vomiting, the pul&s;e is &s;mall, weak, and
<PB N="167" REF="028021_0163_0FD6712DD37A4078">
intermitting; but when it is over, if the &s;timulus continues, the circulation is increa&s;ed, a fullne&s;s and &s;oftne&s;s of the pul&s;e, a de|termination of the fluids to the &s;urface of the body, and &s;weat;&mdash;this la&s;t may be &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from an increa&s;ed circu|lation, but Dr. Cullen thinks it may al&s;o from the con&s;ent of the &s;tomach and &s;urface, and that anti&s;pa&s;modic virtue takes place with regard to the extreme ve&s;&s;els, which is illu&s;trated from this; that emetics combined with other anti&s;pa&s;modics, (148) as opium, increa&s;e the power, &s;o that combined they become more efficacious diaphoretics," or <HI>promoters of in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration or &s;weat,</HI> "than each when alone."</P>
<P>The&s;e are their primary effects, which, if we con&s;ider clo&s;ely, will be productive of a variety of others, infinitely a greater num|ber, than by any cla&s;s of medicines with which we are acquaint|ed; and indeed from them I have &s;een the mo&s;t &s;erviceable con|&s;equences accrue. Not but I think their u&s;e, in many ca&s;es, &s;hould be con&s;idered with the nice&s;t caution; for advantageous as they are, when properly applied&mdash;in the hands of ignorance, or incon&s;iderate ra&s;hne&s;s, they become too often fatal.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the general &s;hock which emetics give to the &s;y|&s;tem, the evacuations they produce from the &s;tomach, and the effects they have upon the nervous power, we &s;hall be convinc|ed of their utility; by re&s;toring equality to the circulation, pro|ducing lymphatic ab&s;orption, and removing ob&s;tructions in the &s;y&s;tem of blood ve&s;&s;els&mdash;and in the&s;e &s;en&s;es they may be con&s;ider|ed as <HI>irritators of the habit;</HI>&mdash;as <HI>evacuants,</HI> from clearing the &s;to|mach of its contents, and morbid accumulations of &s;ecreted matters lodged there, and di&s;charging al&s;o &s;erous accumulations in different parts of the machine:&mdash;as <HI>anti&s;pa&s;modics,</HI> from &s;ti|mulating the nervous &s;y&s;tem, and the moving powers through the machine in general, and al&s;o obviating violent affections of the nervous power.</P>
<P>But in all ca&s;es of ruptures, or relaxations of containing mem|branes&mdash;in local inflammations of the internal vi&s;cera&mdash;a high degree of morbid debility in the&s;e&mdash;and in fixed ob&s;tructions, unconquerable by the force of the circulation, it has been advi&s;|ed that their u&s;e &s;hould be avoided.</P>
<P>Still, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e prohibitions, &s;o apparently well founded, from the con&s;ideration of the action of emetics, yet they have been admini&s;tered in ca&s;es of &s;chirrhous vi&s;cera, in lo|cal inflammations, and &s;upernatural effu&s;ions of blood; though in the two latter they &s;hould never be attempted without fir&s;t bleeding; though perhaps haemorrhages may <HI>now and then</HI> re|quire this operation; but of the&s;e there are very rare in&s;tances,
<PB N="168" REF="028021_0164_0FD67169E69C1C08">
as they are almo&s;t con&s;tantly attended by an inflammatory di&s;po|&s;ition of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>In all conge&s;tions of the head, they are &s;aid to be dangerous, in apoplexy, pal&s;y, and in &s;maller collections in the veins of the brain. They would, doubtle&s;s, be extremely dangerous where the&s;e maladies ari&s;e from too great &s;anguinary plenitude; but where from mere weakne&s;s of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, or inability of the moving powers, I &s;hould prefer their u&s;e to other reme|dies, at lea&s;t on their fir&s;t appearance; nor &s;hould I he&s;itate in pre&s;cribing them in &s;erous collections, where I was not afraid of any great relaxation of the ve&s;&s;els, or &s;y&s;tem of the &s;olids.</P>
<P>The cla&s;s of EMETICS in u&s;e are not numerous&mdash;indeed, three or four, where we con&s;ider their action only in this point of view, are &s;ufficient, arranging them according to their mode of opera|tion, or peculiar appropriation.</P>

<P N="8">&sect; 8. The next &s;et of medicines in our catalogue are CATHAR|TICS, &s;o named from the Greek word <HI>cathairo,</HI> purgo, to purge, and comprize all &s;uch medicines as evacuate by &s;tool.</P>
<P>Purging, &s;ays BOERHAAVE, is an evacuation of all tho&s;e things which can be thrown out of the body by &s;tool from any part of the machine. And mo&s;t authors have been very prolix on this &s;ubject, as the operation &s;eems to be, and really is, of &s;uch ma|terial con&s;equence to the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>However, we &s;hall content our&s;elves with a more conci&s;e view of their effects, and from thence be &s;ufficiently empowered to deduce their utility.</P>
<P>By their operation they unload the inte&s;tines, and increa&s;e the motion of the bowels downwards; by which means they clear the inte&s;tinal glands, and derive a greater quantity of li|quids, into them; they al&s;o empty the &s;tomach downwards; they evacuate the pancreas and liver, and affect the &s;pleen, and all the vi&s;cera of the lower belly; they promote the ab&s;orption of watery and other thin fluids, &s;tagnating in any cavity; and, by continuance, purge the whole body; but in this la&s;t ca&s;e in|duce debility, if too long per&s;evered in; hence are preferable to other evacuants.</P>
<P>They are apt to produce inflammation in the parts on which they immediately act. They cau&s;e revul&s;ion from the head, by determining the blood into the large artery of the body, called the <HI>de&s;cending aorta,</HI> (29; 30) and hence may be u&s;eful as pro|moters of the men&s;trual di&s;charge, wa&s;hing of virulence in go|norrhoea, in ulcers, by evacuating the &s;y&s;tem in general; and in tho&s;e of the inferior parts, by cau&s;ing a greater flow of liquids to the part. They excite, or, at lea&s;t, increa&s;e inflammation in the inte&s;tines, nay &s;ome propagate the &s;ame over the &s;y&s;tem; and, when thrown into the blood, are mo&s;t of them expectorant and diuretic, cau&s;ing evacuation of phlegm from the che&s;t; and urine through the kidneys.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e purgative effects are produced chiefly by &s;uch things as irritate the fibres and mu&s;cular parts of the inte&s;tines; but <HI>pa&s;&s;ions of the mind</HI> will al&s;o promote inte&s;tinal di&s;charge; and &s;ome will have that occa&s;ioned from <HI>&s;mell alone,</HI> others from <HI>ex|ternal application,</HI> &s;ome <HI>from the diminution of in&s;en&s;ible per&s;pira|tion,</HI> but this happens in a moi&s;t thick atmo&s;phere, and others
<PB N="170" REF="028021_0166_0FD6716EC0C065E8">
<HI>from eternal motion,</HI> as that of a &s;hip or carriage;&mdash;upon the whole, it is tolerably conclu&s;ive, that purging ari&s;es from inte&s;|tinal &s;timulus, either mental or corporeal.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the u&s;e of purgatives are &s;o very &s;aluta|ry in their different degrees, according to the cau&s;es requiring them, yet, by being too frequently renewed, they are apt to wea|ken the tone of the inte&s;tines, and indeed their &s;en&s;ibility. Hence are produced, if we add the con&s;equences of evacuation, often irregular &s;pa&s;modic affections.</P>
<P>Dr. CULLEN &s;ays, that all purgatives are endowed with an inflammatory acrimony, not only exciting it in the part to which they are applied, but acting in the &s;ame manner, as poi&s;ons; their &s;timulus, extended to the &s;y&s;tem, produces and aggravates fever, and an inflammatory di&s;po&s;ition; and as it is chiefly di|rected to the rectum, they increa&s;e the piles, and extend their irritation to the pa&s;&s;age from the neck of the bladder, called <HI>ure|thra.</HI></P>
<P>We are led to di&s;cover, from the conci&s;e view we have ta|ken of the &s;ubject, from whence their utility ari&s;es;&mdash;FIRST, as <HI>evacuants</HI> from removing any morbid retention of the contents of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines&mdash;dimini&s;hing the quantity of cir|culating fluids, when too abundant for the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem at that time&mdash;and carrying off morbid accumulations of &s;erum. SECONDLY, as <HI>&s;timulants,</HI> by promoting the free circulation through the inte&s;tines in tho&s;e ca&s;es where it is morbidly imped|ed&mdash;dimini&s;hing the force of the blood again&s;t parts morbidly affected&mdash;removing torpor in the mu&s;cular fibres of the inte&s;tines&mdash;and re&s;training inordinate motion in the&s;e mu&s;cular fibres, by &s;timulating them to regular and more con&s;tant action.</P>
<P>But we find that &s;ome of the&s;e have, be&s;ides the powers enumerated, tho&s;e which are <HI>cooling, a&s;tringent,</HI> and <HI>emollient.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, &s;hould there be in the bowels any high degree of irri|tability, and the circulation &s;hould there be morbidly accelerat|ed, of the <HI>&s;timulating cla&s;s</HI> we &s;hould make no u&s;e&mdash;if the circu|lation &s;hould be uncommonly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low and languid, tho&s;e which are &s;tiled <HI>cooling</HI> will be improper&mdash;if habitual co&s;tivene&s;s be an er|ror of the habit, the <HI>a&s;tringents</HI> mu&s;t be wrong&mdash;and where un|common relaxation of the inte&s;tines is prevalent, the <HI>emollient</HI> ought not to be applied.</P>

However, here we only mention the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a &s;pecification, which we &s;hall point out, on treating of particular defects of con&s;titution, which require the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;crimination.</P>

&s;ecreted by the kidneys, and excreted by the bladder, which la&s;t in the repo&s;itory for that fluid.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the great labour different authors have be|&s;towed in properly &s;electing this cla&s;s of medicines, and the con|fidence with which many have &s;poken re&s;pecting their operati|ons, &s;till their effects are indi&s;putably uncertain.</P>
<P>How &s;ome things pa&s;s off by urine &s;o immediately after be|ing taken into the &s;tomach, is &s;till a matter of di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Some a&s;tringents have been con&s;idered of the diuretic cla&s;s, from their action; and doubtle&s;s have produced this way very good effects, as the leaves of the bear's wortle berry, and bitters; nay &s;ome have publicly declared the power of a&s;tringents in expelling a calculus. As diuretics act not by di&s;&s;olving the blood, but by their local or &s;ympathetic &s;timulus under &s;ome circum&s;tances, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why a&s;tringents may not become diuretics in relaxed and torpid habits&mdash;many of the operations of the animal oeconomy may be produced by relieving the parts from any defect they may labour under, which defect may re|tard, or prohibit their action.</P>
<P>Pal&s;y of the kidneys will hinder a &s;ecretion of urine; torpid|ity in tho&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem, or relaxation, will proporti|onally weaken their power, which being removed, they will be enabled to act; and certainly a&s;tringents bid fair to produce the de&s;ired effect. However, in order to be acquainted with their utility, we mu&s;t now inquire what are the general effects pro|duced on the &s;y&s;tem by their application;&mdash;where there is a &s;uperabundant quantity of &s;erous fluids in the blood, and the ab|&s;orbents appear to be in too inactive a &s;tate, they become bene|ficial, by removing the former, and increa&s;ing the ab&s;orbent pow|er of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem&mdash;hence drawing off water accumu|lated and &s;tagnating in any of the cavities of the body. In &s;cor|butic habits, they remove morbid acrimony from the blood, by carrying off the &s;aline and putre&s;cent particles of the ma&s;s of blood, which are generally di&s;&s;olved in the &s;erous part of that fluid&mdash;and when there is a &s;uperabundance of circulating liquids too great for the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, by dimini&s;hing them they become &s;erviceable&mdash;hence we find, their chief action is to pro|mote evacuation.</P>
<P>When the natural &s;ecretion of urine is morbidly defective, they re&s;tore that &s;ecretion, by &s;oliciting a flow of fluids to the kidneys, and hence dimini&s;h other &s;ecretions when morbidly augmented: and hence remove ob&s;tructions in the canals of the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, and from them wa&s;h out all acrimony.</P>
<P>But, in order to promote their operation, they &s;hould be given

in the mo&s;t dilute &s;tate; we might &s;ay, it is always proper to throw in with them much aqueous fluid, except in ca&s;es of drop|&s;y; and, even in this ca&s;e, there have been cures performed by drinking large quantities of mineral and common water. But where the intention of any medicine is to pa&s;s off by urine, the patient &s;hould walk gently in a cool air, and avoid all &s;ituations calculated to produce a determination of fluids to the &s;kin; for there is &s;o intimate a connection between the kidneys and the &s;kin, that diuretic medicines, when thrown into the habit, will often prove &s;trong promoters of in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration.</P>
<P>According to the particular nature of the &s;eparate action of diuretics, we &s;hall be enabled to judge where they are impro|per.</P>
<P>Should there be too high a degree of &s;en&s;ibility in the kidneys, a con&s;iderable increa&s;e of urine, or any fixed ob&s;tructions in the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, the admini&s;tration of tho&s;e which are <HI>&s;timulant</HI> mu&s;t be di&s;advantageous.</P>
<P>If there &s;hould be a deficiency of &s;erous fluids in the &s;y&s;tem, the above al&s;o are improper, and tho&s;e of the <HI>cooling cla&s;s</HI>&mdash;but where there is a redundancy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ero&s;ity, the prohibition of <HI>dilu|ent diuretics</HI> are fairly pointed out.</P>
<P>Though we know not of any of this cla&s;s that will always in|fallibly exert its diuretic power, &s;till the catalogue given us by a variety of authors is exten&s;ively prolix;&mdash;we &s;hall &s;elect &s;uch as are con&s;idered the mo&s;t efficacious according to the particular &s;tates of the con&s;titutions which may require them;&mdash;and the&s;e we &s;hall compri&s;e under three heads&mdash;of <HI>&s;timulant, cooling</HI>&mdash;and <HI>diluent.</HI></P>

<P>&sect; 10. DIAPHORETICS, derived from the Greek <HI>diaphoreo,</HI> transfero, to carry through, include all &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as increa&s;e per&s;piration, or &s;weat. This cla&s;s u&s;ed to be divided from &s;u|dori&s;ics, or &s;uch medicines as promoted &s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, but unnece&s;&s;arily; for they &s;eem only to differ in their degrees of ac|tion, promoting the &s;ame effect, more or le&s;s copiou&s;ly or per|ceptibly. But as different purpo&s;es may be an&s;wered by the dif|ferent degrees of action of tho&s;e parts which produce the&s;e effects, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome &s;pecification re&s;pecting the two.</P>
<P>In&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration is promoted by all &s;uch materials as produce an a&s;tringent effect upon, or contract the &s;olids in a mo|derate degree, by occa&s;ioning an increa&s;e of ela&s;ticity or &s;pringi|ne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els, and thus promote the circulation&mdash;hence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> bark&mdash;all the a&s;tringent roots&mdash;au&s;tere wines&mdash;come un|der this divi&s;ion, as do exerci&s;e which is moderate, either walk|ing, riding on hor&s;eback, or in a carriage&mdash;mild &s;timulants, or tho&s;e of the &s;tronger cla&s;s weakened.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="028021_0174_0FD6717503F5C758">
Or, by &s;uch things as determine the matter of per&s;piration to the &s;kin, &s;uch as moderately warm air, temperate exerci&s;e, an e|qual circulation of the fluids when the body is at re&s;t, as well as in motion.</P>
<P>Or, occa&s;ion &s;uch a temperature of the &s;kin, that it &s;hall nei|ther be too relaxed nor more rigid than requi&s;ite&mdash;hence fric|tions, lotions, and deter&s;ion are recommended; and it is from producing this effect that the&s;e things are found &s;o beneficial to the &s;tudious, inactive, and tho&s;e who are advanced in life&mdash;un|loading the &s;y&s;tem by tho&s;e means, without weakening it in the &s;malle&s;t degree, but, on the contrary, increa&s;ing its power.</P>
<P>Now SWEATING is promoted by nearly the &s;ame means, for all &s;uch things as relax the ve&s;&s;els, and determine powerfully to the &s;kin, will produce this effect, whether internally or external|ly applied.</P>
<P>Hence come under this cla&s;s all tho&s;e diuretics which act not upon the kidneys electively&mdash;warm water, or barley-water &s;weet|ened with honey, excite a copious &s;weat&mdash;a gla&s;s of cold water drank going to bed&mdash;al&s;o tho&s;e things which take off &s;pa&s;m, whe|ther they are demulcent, or moderate or correct acrimony, as o|pium&mdash;te&s;taceous powders. All &s;trong frictions, warm vapor, particularly of water, warm bathing, or whatever will render the &s;kin relaxed or &s;oft.</P>

<P>Mace, a &s;mall portion, to give it an agreeable flavour.</P>
<P>Water, twelve or fourteen ounces; let this be drank in bed after the manner of tea or coffee; and the patient there wait the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>Care though &s;hould be taken, that honey does not di&s;agree with the con&s;titution; for, where there is any natural antipathy, it is apt to produce violent affections on the &s;tomach and bowels; &s;u|gar &s;hould therefore, in the&s;e ca&s;es, &s;upply its place, or treacle will have a better effect. Whatever is taken hot, as well as heat|ing aromatics, opiates, as al&s;o violent motion, are highly &s;udo|rific.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;uch things as dimini&s;h the external pre&s;&s;ure of the air, and tho&s;e which increa&s;e the &s;trength of the heart, with re|&s;pect to its number and force of pul&s;ations, come under the head

of &s;udorifics&mdash;&s;uch as Rheni&s;h wine, fre&s;h juice of citron, pene|trating aromatics, volatile &s;alts, &amp;c.&mdash;tho&s;e things which &s;timu|late externally, as all acrid matters applied to the &s;kin, as vine|gar and ginger, which is the mo&s;t &s;ubtile and penetrating, and much recommended by HELMONT&mdash;and la&s;tly, whatever, re&s;tores impeded motion in the internal parts, as pa&s;&s;ions and affections of the mind reproduce retarded per&s;piration.</P>
<P>Though a number of the medicines mentioned above are &s;tiled diaphoretics; &s;till, &s;trictly &s;peaking, and con&s;idering them as &s;uch, independent of their connection with &s;udorifics we have no one of which we can &s;peak with any certainty that has been tri|ed by &s;tatical experiment, the only mode we have of di&s;covering them, except AS A FOETIDA, as handed down to us by SANCTO|RIUS&mdash;yet I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that the power of all &s;udorifics weakened might be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as diaphoretics; for we find all tho&s;e things which can increa&s;e the circulation, determine the fluids externally to the &s;kin, and take off the &s;pa&s;m from the minute ve&s;&s;els, are certainly entitled to the character of diapho|retics and &s;udorifics; and the&s;e three particular circum&s;tances &s;hould be adverted to, when we want to promote a di&s;charge of this &s;ort for any good purpo&s;e; for though &s;timulants and &s;eda|tives, or medicines po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing both the&s;e powers, may in many ca&s;es be very proper, they may in &s;ome, conjunctively or &s;eparate|ly con&s;idered, be detrimental&mdash;and indeed there may be com|plaints where &s;weating would be improper, though the promo|tion of gentle per&s;piration might be u&s;eful, as in the &s;curvy&mdash;but in the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, if the effect could be produced with ea&s;e, &s;weating is the be&s;t method of cure, and preferable to ei|ther evacuation by &s;tool, or &s;alivation.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced, we &s;hall find that all general &s;timulants of the &s;y&s;tem, as motion and heat, are powerful &s;u|dorifics;&mdash;particular ones are either applied to the excretories, tho&s;e pores from whence the &s;weat i&s;&s;ues, or to the parts con&s;ent|ing with them, as the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines; hence their action is either general, local, or &s;ympathetic.</P>

<P>A great deal has been written, and much time wa&s;ted, by au|thors, in endeavouring to account for the preci&s;e manner in which nature performs this operation in the female machine: the only pre&s;ent &s;atisfactory conclu&s;ion we have on this head is, that a fullne&s;s of the uterine &s;y&s;tem, from a peculiar determination of the blood to that organ, a permeability in the uterine and va|ginal ve&s;&s;els, and an increa&s;ed impul&s;ive power, all periodically exerted, are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;alutary promotion of that di&s;charge&mdash;and when there ari&s;es a deficiency in all or any of the&s;e parti|culars, ob&s;tructions will take place, which require the aid of that cla&s;s of medicines of which we are now to treat;&mdash;but as there are various purpo&s;es often to be an&s;wered, e'er we can promote the de&s;ired end, different medicines have been pointed out, and formed into divi&s;ions according to their action.</P>

<P>If now we call to our recollection what has been delivered&mdash;the means by which the&s;e appropriate remedies are rendered &s;erviceable, will be&mdash;from promoting freely the circulation of the blood in the neighbourhood of the uterus, when too much ob&s;tructed there&mdash;from increa&s;ing the accumulation in the ute|rine ve&s;&s;els them&s;elves, which is nece&s;&s;ary to the men&s;trual di&s;|charge&mdash;and removing morbid ob&s;tructions to the pa&s;&s;age of blood

<P>WE are arrived at the third part of our arrangement, and mu&s;t proceed now to treat on MEDICINES WHICH ACT UP|ON THE FLUIDS THROUGH THE SYSTEM, in the &s;ame manner as we have before &s;poken on tho&s;e which acted upon the &s;olids; and the&s;e include ATTENUANTS INSPISSANTS&mdash;and DEMUL|CENTS&mdash;And, fir&s;t, of</P>

perfectly expre&s;&s;es the nature of all the medicines of this cla&s;s, and comprehends whatever can be under&s;tood by <HI>diluting, incid|ing,</HI> and <HI>re&s;olving</HI> medicaments; three terms into which this cla&s;s have been, by many, divided, becau&s;e they all contribute to render the fluids more thin and fluxile.</P>
<P>Butas this point may be accompli&s;hed in two ways, either by &s;ub&s;tances mixing with a fluid, and rendering it more thin, but not changing or altering the particles of which it was com|po&s;ed; or having the power of dimini&s;hing the cohe&s;ion of the blood, and thus rendering its texture le&s;s firm and tenacious; they may be certainly, and ought to be divided, according to their action, into <HI>diluent</HI> and <HI>re&s;olvent.</HI></P>
<P>Among the fir&s;t we cannot be properly &s;aid to have any other than water, which is productive of a variety of good effects up|on the habit&mdash;but not merely by its diluting property, it acts more particularly, immediately, and univer&s;ally, by its coldne&s;s. Now, as a diluent, it not only thins the fluids in the way we have above &s;pecified, but it a&s;&s;i&s;ts dige&s;tion, (106) quenches thir&s;t&mdash;is an univer&s;al vehicle for &s;olid food, corrects acrimony&mdash;pro|motes fluid &s;ecretions&mdash;and is by many e&s;teemed, much more than any other medicine, an univer&s;al remedy.</P>
<P>Now, as it is clear that all diluents &s;hould be more fluid than the humours which are by their intervention to be rendered thin|ner; and have at the &s;ame time, when mixed, the property of making them retain their acquired fluidity&mdash;we &s;hall find, there is not any thing except water that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this power.</P>
<P>Though wine&mdash;oil&mdash;&s;aline &s;ub&s;tances&mdash;fermented &s;pirits&mdash;and &s;ome earthy &s;ub&s;tances have been &s;aid to enjoy the&s;e vir|tues, &s;till it is obvious, that they are defective, and have not them in that degree &s;o as to become really diluent&mdash;for wine, as a diluter, depends upon its watery particles joined with its &s;timulating power&mdash;oil renders the ma&s;s of fluids rather more vi&s;cid&mdash;&s;aline &s;ub&s;tances re&s;olve by their &s;timulus&mdash;fermented &s;pirits are more apt to coagulate&mdash;earths are of them&s;elves &s;olid and inert, and can never be taken in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ew, but as they may mix with &s;ome acidities in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, and thus change their form, and become active from their a&s;&s;uming that of neutral &s;alts, and with them may they be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; therefore it is to water we mu&s;t re&s;ort, when we wi&s;h to call in aid alone a purely diluting power&mdash;to which, it has been &s;aid, if we add gentle heat, or &s;aline particles, as &s;ea &s;alt, Polychre&s;t &s;alt, &s;al ammoniac, or borax, we &s;hall improve its power, by the addi|tion of their &s;timulating effects, but this is adding a re&s;olvent property&mdash;Moderate motion is al&s;o &s;aid to improve its powers.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="028021_0181_0FD6714832B1EBA8">
But as for re&s;olvents, they act by increa&s;ing the force of the moving powers by the &s;timulus they po&s;&s;e&s;s in a limited degree; for &s;hould they act violently, they would, by di&s;&s;ipating the thin|ner part of the fluids, render them thicker, and become incra&s;&s;ants; but by gently &s;timulating, though they produce evacuation, they permit the ve&s;&s;els to act more freely upon their contained fluids, and hence become re&s;olvent.</P>
<P>On con&s;idering the action of this cla&s;s, we &s;hall be empowered to di&s;cover, that their beneficial effects ari&s;e, from removing any morbid vi&s;cidity in the blood, and re&s;toring a free circulation, when in the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els it is morbidly ob&s;tructed&mdash;from increa&s;ing the quantity of &s;erous evacuations, when too greatly dimini&s;hed&mdash;and rendering them, when too thick and vi&s;cid, more fluid.</P>
<P>But their u&s;e mu&s;t be prohibited in con&s;titutions labouring under too great thinne&s;s of the general ma&s;s of fluids&mdash;having a propen&s;ity to morbid &s;erous accumulations&mdash;or a remarkable increa&s;e of &s;imilar &s;ecretions.</P>

<P N="2">&sect; 2. INSPISSANTS&mdash;the&s;e are al&s;o called INCRASSANTS&mdash;from the Latin words <HI>in&s;pi&s;&s;o</HI> and <HI>incra&s;&s;o,</HI> to thicken. The&s;e terms, like the former, give us a perfect idea of their import&mdash;from whence we under&s;tand all &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as give a degree of vi&s;cidity, to the circulating fluids.</P>
<P>From experience we know that our fluids do &s;ometimes run into a &s;tate of morbid thinne&s;s; but by what means, is very doubtful.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="028021_0182_0FD6717DB4F53C58">
Some have &s;uppo&s;ed it to ari&s;e from too great a proportion of fluid aliment; whil&s;t others have been led to believe, it origi|nated from a retention of &s;ome of the &s;erous &s;ecretions. But if we reflect, that children and many adults live upon food totally liquid almo&s;t, yet no &s;uch appearance is the re&s;ult; and that nature always &s;upplies the defect of one &s;ecretion by the increa&s;e of &s;ome other, and the retention mu&s;t be partial, it cannot be univer&s;al; both the&s;e opinions &s;eem by no means &s;atisfac|tory.</P>
<P>I rather think that it is occa&s;ioned by a relaxation of the &s;y&s;|tem, particularly of &s;ome, or the whole of the dige&s;tive organs; for &s;trong, mu&s;cular, laborious ru&s;tics, who&s;e dige&s;tive powers are good, have generally, nay, I believe always, the blood &s;end|ing to the oppo&s;ite extreme&mdash;whil&s;t the more delicate and relax|ed, who&s;e dige&s;tive powers are weak, have the &s;anguinary ma&s;s too fluid: indeed people who&s;e blood has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a proper tex|ture, have, from illne&s;s, had it reduced to a &s;tate manife&s;ting a too weak cohe&s;ion, and that apparently by the &s;y&s;tem being de|bilitated.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the cau&s;e, it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to remedy the effects; and the&s;e we attempt by reproducing a proper proportion of vi&s;cid fluids, and by increa&s;ing their attractive power one with another; and their con&s;equences may, we think, be acquired by the following catalogue of INSPISSANTS:

<P>It has been remarked by &s;ome authors, that acids&mdash;wine&mdash;al|chohol&mdash;and in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the a&s;tringents u&s;ed internally, have been &s;aid not to produce their in&s;pi&s;&s;ating effect; and &s;hould therefore only be employed externally, in ca&s;es of profu&s;e bleedings; and that the nutritious and demulcent cla&s;s, of which
<PB N="187" REF="028021_0183_0FD6714956C865C0">
we &s;hall next treat, mu&s;t, for re&s;toring the vi&s;cid fluids, be de|pended upon.</P>
<P>However, I cannot avoid thinking the whole, alchohol except|ed, may be u&s;ed with much advantage; and greatly a&s;&s;i&s;tant in rendering tho&s;e, which act merely on the blood, more quickly efficacious, by invigorating the &s;y&s;tem, increa&s;ing the &s;trength of its va&s;cular power, and con&s;equently the action of the ve&s;&s;els upon the contained fluids.</P>
<P>On this head authors have confined them&s;elves to &s;uch &s;ub|&s;tances as were either <HI>farinaceous,</HI> as barley, wheat, rye, and &s;uch&mdash;or <HI>mucilaginous,</HI> as mar&s;h-mallows, gum arabic, i&s;ingla&s;s, &amp;c. and conceived their utility to be derived from removing morbid tenuity in the blood&mdash;preventing the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of red blood through ve&s;&s;els not naturally fitted to receive it&mdash;dimini&s;hing the quantity of tho&s;e &s;ecretions which were &s;erous, and too copious, and rendering them more vi&s;cid where morbidly thin and fluid&mdash;and have prohibited their u&s;e in morbid vi&s;cidity of the blood&mdash;preternatural diminution of the &s;ecretions in general&mdash;and a high degree of debility of the dige&s;tive organs.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded that in many ca&s;es, particularly in tho&s;e where a weak dige&s;tion is prevalent, the u&s;e of &s;ome of the &s;timulant aromatics, mixed with the invigorating a&s;tringents, &s;uch as bit|ters, bark, iron, would greatly conduce to conquer many of tho&s;e defects for which incra&s;&s;ants are pre&s;cribed, and I have repeated|ly &s;een their good effects; indeed I very often unite them, and find, that, conjoined, they prove more efficacious than when ad|mini&s;tered &s;eparately.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. DEMULCENTS, from <HI>demulceo,</HI> to appea&s;e or mollify. The&s;e by &s;ome have been con&s;idered to act in a double capacity, by blunting or &s;heathing the acrid particles of our morbid hu|mours, or promoting an entire change in &s;uch as were offen&s;ive from their acrimony, and forming a third &s;ub&s;tance, perfectly different in its nature with re&s;pect to its action. Hence have they been ranked as general and particular demulcents. In the latter cla&s;s are enumerated all the acids and alkalines, as well as &s;ome metals, with regard to their influence on each other; as if one was creative of any di&s;turbance in the habit, by exerting a morbid &s;timulus from its acrimony, the other on being given proved corrective, and cured the affection; hence was &s;tiled de|mulcent; but the&s;e are more properly arranged under other heads, as the antalkaline and antacids, of which we &s;hall &s;oon treat in their &s;eparate places.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent we &s;hall con&s;ider them only as obtunders of, or blunting acrimony, by mixing with and preventing the acrid
<PB N="188" REF="028021_0184_0FD6717F4D03CD68">
part of the fluids from exerting them&s;elves on the &s;olids, &s;o as to create pain, or other unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>And it will appear then, that of all this cla&s;s, in this view of the &s;ubject, are either mucilaginous, oily, or a compo&s;ition of both; and the&s;e manife&s;t their action immediately in the &s;tomach or inte&s;tines; or, after having pa&s;&s;ed through the circulation, in the &s;ecretory organs.</P>
<P>For it is imagined, that acrimony takes not place in the blood ve&s;&s;els, but in the &s;ecretions, as the &s;erum is thought to be the vehicle of acrid &s;ub&s;tances. The&s;e demulcents, therefore, mix|ed with the blood are &s;eparated with the &s;erous, or thinner parts of the fluids, in tho&s;e places of the &s;y&s;tem where &s;ecretions hap|pen; and thus, by enveloping the irritating particles, prevent them from &s;timulating.</P>
<P>Thus they defend the kidneys, the lungs, the ve&s;&s;els of the vagina and uterus, in nephritic or gravelly complaints; in de|fluxions on the lungs; and ca&s;es of the whites; and are highly u&s;eful in haemorrhages, which are often maintained by acrimo|ny; for increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of mucus is always acrid, till its thinner parts are di&s;&s;ipated, by lying &s;ome time&mdash;hence their u&s;e in coughs, defluxions on the brea&s;t, the whites, and tho&s;e di&s;|charges after child-birth, called lochial.</P>
<P>Whatever good we may perceive can be derived from medi|cines of this nature, may be acquired from &s;ome of the following &s;election of DEMULCENTS:
<LIST>

though the&s;e la&s;t can &s;carce be &s;aid to act in the mode we have de&s;cribed of common demulcents; but rather take off the acri|mony by dimini&s;hing the &s;en&s;ibility of parts; and produce a vi&s;co&s;ity of the &s;ecreted fluids, it is obvious from the appearance of the matter, in tho&s;e who have taken opiates, after their nar|cotic effects have cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>And this I take to be owing to the ve&s;&s;els being by their pow|er thrown into a &s;tate of torpor, and thus &s;uffering the &s;ecreted fluid to become more den&s;e by its continuance, and con&s;equently le&s;s acrimonious from the di&s;&s;ipation of its more &s;erous parts.</P>
<P>They have been divided into LENIENT DEMULCENTS, &s;uch as

<P>The u&s;e to be acquired from the admini&s;tration of the&s;e mate|rials are, a diminution of the action of the ordinary &s;timuli upon parts affected with too great &s;en&s;ibility, and a &s;upply of the na|tural coverings of the parts where too defective&mdash;dimini&s;hing morbid acrimony in the &s;y&s;tem in general&mdash;and rendering more mild tho&s;e &s;ecretions which are praeternaturally, or too violent|ly acrid.</P>
<P>But their admini&s;tration would be pernicious, if there was any defect of a natural pungency in the &s;ecreted fluids&mdash;a great degree of vi&s;cidity in the coverings of the &s;en&s;ible parts&mdash;or an uncommon want of &s;en&s;ibility in the excretory organs.</P>

<P>WE are now come to our fourth divi&s;ion, wherein we pur|po&s;e to con&s;ider</P>
<P>MEDICINES WHICH MANIFEST THEIR SENSIBLE ACTION CHIEFLY, IF NOT SOLELY, IN THE FIRST PASSAGES RESPECT|ING THE FLUIDS.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of which pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our view are,</P>
<P N="1"> &sect; 1. ANTALKALINES, from the Greek words <HI>anti,</HI> again&s;t, and <HI>alkali,</HI> alkalies, con&s;equently all acids and ace&s;cent materials come under this de&s;cription; as do all &s;uch medicines as conquer alkalies, and de&s;troy their power of action as &s;uch. But in this place the acids and ace&s;cents are only to be con&s;idered as correc|tors of alkale&s;cent &s;ub&s;tances; for we have before &s;een the di|ver&s;ified power they appear to maintain as <HI>a&s;tringents, &s;timulants, &s;edatives, in&s;pi&s;&s;ants, cathartics, diuretics,</HI> and they will al&s;o rank with <HI>antiputre&s;cents;</HI> at lea&s;t &s;uch of them as have been &s;elected agreeable to the effects they have been thought to produce on the human machine: and here their chief action appears to me to be in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages only, where, coming in contact with alkale&s;cent &s;ub&s;tances, there they neutralize them.</P>
<P>I am of opinion, that where there happens to be, from any di&s;ea&s;e, an alkale&s;cent &s;tate of the fluids, they are not of much &s;ervice by acting in them merely again&s;t, and correcting &s;uch al|kale&s;cency; for when our fluids are affected to any con&s;iderable degree with this, little is in our power; but in ca&s;es of this kind,
<PB N="190" REF="028021_0186_0FD67181159471D0">
&s;hould they be of any &s;ervice. I am per&s;uaded it is more from their action communicated to the &s;olids, particularly the mineral acids, than from any other cau&s;e. Perhaps the utility derived from the native acids depends more upon the fixed air, with which they are replete; for we have not a more powerful cor|rector of putre&s;cent acrimony than this &s;pecies of air.</P>
<P>They have been divided into vegetable and &s;aline antalkalines&mdash;but the better divi&s;ion is, into native, of which &s;orrel, barber|ry, and tamarinds, form examples&mdash;and into artificial, as the a|cid of vitriol, &s;ea &s;alt, nitre, and vegetable.</P>

And likewi&s;e the whole cla&s;s of DEMULCENTS; but the&s;e act by mechanical, not chemical mixture&mdash;that is, from merely mix|ing with and &s;heathing the offending particles, not from altering them, by forming a new combination, &s;o that each body lo&s;es totally its natural properties, and becomes a third, differing from

</LIST>
<P>Though mo&s;t of the&s;e act by coming in contact with the prevail|ing acid immediately, without con&s;idering the &s;olids&mdash;yet tho&s;e under the general titles, except the demulcents, which become &s;erviceable by their &s;heathing property, produce their effects by the influence they have on the moving powers, which we have in their proper places before &s;pecified.</P>
<P>As the action of the&s;e, like the former, is &s;o very limited, on|ly to be con&s;idered in this place as counteracting acidity in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ay little more than will be &s;ufficient to &s;hew where they will be beneficial, or in what ca&s;es their exhibition would be improper.</P>
<P>When there is a morbid prevalence and &s;en&s;ation of &s;ourne&s;s in the alimentary canal; when, from the &s;ame cau&s;e in the &s;to|mach, the natural appetite is vitiated, and the action of that or|gan and inte&s;tines is di&s;ordered, they are of &s;ervice in remov|ing the former, and re&s;toring the two latter to their healthful &s;tandard.</P>
<P>But when there is a prevalence of alcale&s;cency in the &s;tomach and bowels, or a tendency to putridity in the general ma&s;s of blood, they mu&s;t be highly detrimental. And, perhaps, in this la&s;t ca&s;e, the mi&s;chief which would ari&s;e from their u&s;e may be more owing to the de&s;truction of the acid in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, than from joining in their alcale&s;cent &s;tate with the fluids, as a|cids have been con&s;idered antiputre&s;cent.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. ANTISEPTICS, from <HI>anti,</HI> again&s;t, <HI>&s;eptica,</HI> putrefaci|entia, &s;ub&s;tances occa&s;ioning putrefaction. The&s;e include all &s;uch materials as obviate the too great putre&s;cency of our fluids.</P>
<P>Now as the putre&s;cency of our humours may be brought on by exce&s;s of heat and motion, as well as receiving any putrid ferment into the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem&mdash;as it, when once fixed, and begun to exerci&s;e its deleterious action, induces languor and great debility in the moving powers, we may &s;ee the rea&s;on of our anti&s;eptic cla&s;s of medicines, exhibiting, according to the conception we have of their action, &s;uch apparently contradictory views&mdash;for in the &s;ame arrangement we &s;hall find, that we have the <HI>volatile &s;alt,</HI> and tho&s;e of the <HI>neutral kind</HI>&mdash;the former con|&s;idered as highly heating, and a &s;trong &s;timulant of the moving powers&mdash;the other as cooling the &s;y&s;tem, and mitigating va&s;cu|lar motion.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="028021_0189_0FD67151C3B50538">
From thence I pre&s;ume, that they are only applicable in dif|ferent &s;tages of putre&s;cent action; or in different con&s;titutions affected with putrefaction;&mdash;and not unlikely the &s;ame may hold good with acids and alkalies, for they are both enumerated under anti&s;pa&s;modics. Of the&s;e different &s;ub&s;tances it therefore behoves us to be careful in the application.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;tages, <HI>where a putrid tendency</HI> may be accompained <HI>with high degrees of circulatory motion and heat,</HI> or in con&s;titu|tions where the&s;e are prevalent, neutral &s;alines and ace&s;cents may be the mo&s;t proper; but&punc; <HI>in languid habits,</HI> or tho&s;e made &s;uch by the continuance of the enervating power of putrid particles, vo|latiles and cordials challenge the preference.</P>
<P>Nitre has been &s;aid to be &s;trongly anti&s;eptic, when applied to inanimate animal matter, but not &s;o in the living &s;ubject, as it le&s;&s;ens the powers of the vital actions&mdash;but this is only applica|ble in the advanced &s;tage of putre&s;cency; and it is to that &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e alone they mu&s;t mean to advert, who advance, that cordials, and whatever invigorates the &s;olids, by increa&s;ing the vital heat, are properly antiputre&s;cent, and by what alone relief can be obtained in putrid complaints.</P>
<P>However, our chief intent in the&s;e ca&s;es is to keep up a due action of the moving powers, and a proper tone of the &s;olids, that is, an active firmne&s;s&mdash;which effects, we conclude, may be produced by the &s;ub&s;equent &s;election of ANTISEPTICS:</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>IN our fifth and la&s;t divi&s;ion we include MEDICINES WHICH PRODUCE THEIR CONSEQUENCES BY EXTERNAL APPLICA|TION;&mdash;OR ON SUBSTANCES FORMED WITHIN THE MACHINE, THOUGH LODGED WITHOUT THE VERGE OF CIRCULATION. The fir&s;t of which we &s;hall con&s;ider are,</P>
<P>&sect; 1. EPISPASTICS, or VESICATORIES, from <HI>epi&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> to draw, and <HI>ve&s;icatorium,</HI> as rai&s;ing a bli&s;ter. They are therefore &s;timulants, in the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e, locally &s;uch; and, if continued, be|come evacuants.</P>
<P>But their action is not confined to tho&s;e places where they im|mediately act; they communicate that action to the &s;y&s;tem in general, and often in particular to the urinary pa&s;&s;ages; but this effect is chiefly produced by cantharides, or Spani&s;h flies.</P>
<P>They have been formed into three divi&s;ions, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. Such as only occa&s;ion heat in the part&mdash;of which cla&s;s may be con&s;idered the &s;lighter &s;timulants.</P>
<P N="2">2. Such which create heat, with &s;ome degree of inflammation, as Hor&s;e-radi&s;h&mdash;Mu&s;tard&mdash;Volatile alkali.</P>
<P N="3">3. Tho&s;e which rai&s;e bli&s;ters, as cantharides, Euphorbium;&mdash;to which may be added a fourth.</P>
<P N="4">4. Tho&s;e which produce a di&s;charge of pus, as Setons and I&s;&s;ues.</P>
<P>They are often applied with different intents, either as they act on the nervous power, alter the balance of circulation, or produce evacuation; hence are their particular u&s;es di&s;coverable;&mdash;in removing torpidity, or languor in the &s;y&s;tem&mdash;conquering the effects of more than u&s;ual &s;en&s;ibility&mdash;decrea&s;ing violent pain&mdash;weakening the circulatory force of the blood again&s;t any part morbidly affected&mdash;and al&s;o of action in ve&s;&s;els of the neigh|bourhood of tho&s;e to which they are applied. They al&s;o decrea&s;e the volume of the circulating fluids when too great in the habit, and evacuate morbid accumulation of &s;erum.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the &s;y&s;tem be in general highly irritable, the blood praeternaturally thick, or the fluids in general too defective in quantity, the&s;e circum&s;tances demand the prohibition of their u&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. PHLEBOTOMIA, bleeding, from <HI>phleps,</HI> vena, a vein or artery, and <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">o,</HI> &s;eco, to cut.</P>
<P>Under this term are arranged all tho&s;e modes by which blood is evacuated from the machine by the medical art; and the&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> operations are con&s;idered as either producing general or partial
<PB N="196" REF="028021_0192_0FD6718C90DA83A0">
effects, by relieving the &s;y&s;tem in general, or only in &s;ome of its parts.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion of this cla&s;s has commonly been general, and to|pical, or local; and in&s;tanced, in opening a vein, or an artery, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> belong to the fir&s;t; as to the &s;econd, &s;carifications, or cupping-gla&s;&s;es, which are called <HI>cruentae,</HI> from the drawing blood&mdash;and the application of leeches; but the terms, it has been thought, would be more judiciou&s;ly confined to the quantity taken, as veins or arteries mu&s;t in all ca&s;es of blood-letting be opened. <HI>In ge|neral bleeding</HI> we commonly take away &s;uch a quantity as will in &s;ome degree decrea&s;e the power of the &s;y&s;tem&mdash;<HI>in local,</HI> &s;uch a proportion only as may contribute to relieve a part of the &s;y&s;tem near which the operation is performed&mdash;or, we ought to make &s;uch di&s;tinctions, for the &s;ake of propriety, by which we &s;hould under&s;tand, that in general bleeding, the larger branches of the veins or arteries are opened&mdash;in local, only the capillary, or ve|ry &s;mall branches.</P>
<P>From whence the u&s;e accruing from this operation is derived may be ea&s;ily conceived&mdash;as it proceeds either from le&s;&s;ening the quantity of blood, altering the &s;tate of its motion, or changing its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Hence it relieves in all ca&s;es where the ma&s;s of blood abounds too much in quantity; or, when there is a too great ten&s;ion or di&s;ten&s;ion of ve&s;&s;els in the &s;y&s;tem, when the force of circulation is highly increa&s;ed, or the heat immoderate, or when in particu|lar blood-ve&s;&s;els there is a morbid increa&s;e of action, or the force of the blood is too great again&s;t parts morbidly affected.</P>
<P>But where there is too great a &s;carcity of blood, the circula|tion remarkably weak or languid, or too great a debility in the voluntary motions&mdash;the&s;e are powerful objections to its u&s;e.</P>
<P>Though from this operation it is apparent that the highe&s;t ad|vantages may accrue; and indeed, in many ca&s;es which are in|flammatory, or ari&s;e from &s;anguinary conge&s;tion, nothing can be done efficaciou&s;ly without it; &s;till I think it is made infinitely too free u&s;e of, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e places and climates where people are liable to fall into putrid, and &s;ome malignant com|plaints.</P>
<P>Where the patient is &s;trong and athletic the pul&s;e full and ten&s;e, and there appear evident &s;igns of too great plenitude, it is <HI>univer|&s;ally</HI> right to bleed, otherwi&s;e there is &s;ome caution required; for it very often hurries the habit into &s;uch a &s;tate of extreme debility, in &s;ome fevers, that nothing can compen&s;ate the mi&s;chief it occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>In all doubtful ca&s;es, therefore, where it may be thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary for blood to be taken away, I would advi&s;e the operator
<PB N="197" REF="028021_0193_0FD6715482462B28">
to lay his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inger on the pul&s;e of the oppo&s;ite wri&s;t to that where|in the operation is performed; if, during the &s;lowing of the blood, the pul&s;e ri&s;es, it is an indication to per&s;i&s;t; if it &s;hould flag, we &s;hould immediately de&s;i&s;t.</P>

But it is the general opinion of the candid and rational prac|titioners; that tho&s;e who write now on the power of medicine, though they retain the term, only mean &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as po&s;|&s;e&s;s a power of removing the di&s;po&s;ition in the body to the form|ation of calculi, or &s;tony concretions.</P>
<P>Indeed, we have had much &s;aid on the di&s;&s;olving power of al|kalies and quick-lime&mdash;&s;oap ley taken in broth freed from its &s;at&mdash;Mrs. Stevens's &s;olvent, and lime water&mdash;for a long &s;eries of time; &s;till few have found the wi&s;hed for &s;ucce&s;s; but how far they may act as preventive remedies, as well as &s;ome others, cannot be po&s;&s;ibly determined. From the u&s;e of bitters and the uva ur&s;i, or leaves of bear's wortle berry, in this view, I have known &s;ome benefit to ari&s;e in patients &s;ubject to gravelly com|plaints, from a collection of &s;tony or gouty matter.

<P>But it has been alledged, that all alkalies in general po&s;&s;e&s;s this &s;tone-di&s;&s;olving power, therefore in their cau&s;tic &s;tate they are by &s;ome rejected; becau&s;e they are apt to di&s;agree with the &s;tomach, and from thence are they obliged to be employed in too &s;mall do&s;es.</P>
<P>As &s;olvents, I am of opinion, little can be &s;aid of the u&s;e of the cla&s;s here enumerated; but as preventives, having a power to obviate the generation of &s;tony concretions in the machine, they may be con&s;idered to be beneficial in two ways&mdash;in alter|ing the &s;tate of the &s;olids, by preventing a particular &s;tate of laxity of the &s;tomach, and in the kidney&mdash;and in producing &s;uch an effect upon the circulating fluids, that they become le&s;s liable to furni&s;h &s;tony materials to be &s;ecreted by the kidneys.</P>
<P>But certain objections will ari&s;e to the u&s;e of the <HI>antacids,</HI> if in the &s;tomach there &s;hould be a di&s;po&s;ition prevalent to generate alcale&s;cency&mdash;to the <HI>a&s;tringents,</HI> if there &s;hould be a rigidity, or contraction in the coats of that organ.</P>
<P>On <HI>vermifuges</HI> and <HI>lithontriptics</HI> we have been more conci&s;e than on other parts of our &s;ubject; becau&s;e they each are appro|priated here only to the alleviation of &s;ingle complaints &s;pecifi|ed under their re&s;pective heads; of which, when we come to treat hereafter, we &s;hall be obliged to &s;peak more fully; and enlarge more on the particular nature of the remedies in each ca&s;e admini&s;tered: at pre&s;ent it has therefore been thought &s;uf|ficient to furni&s;h a general idea, in order to prepare our readers properly for more ea&s;ily under&s;tanding what we have to deliver on the&s;e heads.</P>

<P>Before I quit this &s;ubject, I would beg leave farther to ob&s;erve, that though I have placed the do&s;es of medicines as u&s;ually ad|mini&s;tered to adults; in all active medicines, I &s;hould recom|mend them to be given in &s;mall do&s;es at fir&s;t, and gradually in|crea&s;ed, till we have arrived at the fulle&s;t that the con&s;titution can bear with ea&s;e, as the only mode of trying what good effect may be produced by their powers: and here we &s;hall often find a &s;urpri&s;ing difference in the quantity nece&s;&s;ary to promote the end de&s;ired&mdash;for I have known two grains of a very active me|dicine produce as powerful an effect on the con&s;titution, as eight or ten would on another; and this knowledge can only be obtain|ed by particular experience. Indeed, I have known complaints cured by the very &s;ame medicine under the management of one practitioner, that had failed in the hands of another; which on|ly

<P>With regard to the forms in which medicines ought to be exhibited, the intent to be an&s;wered &s;hould be particularly con|&s;idered; whether the <HI>expeditious</HI> or <HI>permanent action</HI> is mo&s;t eli|gible&mdash;if the former, they &s;hould be given in liquid&mdash;if the lat|ter, in &s;olid forms&mdash;becau&s;e in their diffu&s;ed &s;tate they act mo&s;t quickly.</P>

<P>By DISEASE is meant a general or local affection, by which the &s;y&s;tem is di&s;turbed, or the action of a part impeded, pervert|ed, or de&s;troyed&mdash;or, an appearance deviating from health, from &s;ome general, partial, or local affection, by which the &s;y&s;tem in general, or in a part, is oppre&s;&s;ed or disfigured&mdash;and this is <HI>di&s;|covered</HI> and <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hed</HI> by an enumeration of certain &s;ymptoms or appearances with which it is always a&s;&s;ociated.&mdash;But di&s;ea&s;es differ; hence it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h them from each other, with which they may &s;eem to have a near affinity&mdash;this is done by the cau&s;es and peculiarities that are connected to them; and from whence the deviation ari&s;es.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="type of fever">
<HEAD>&sect; 1. SIMPLE CONTINUED, OR VASCULO-PLETHO|RIC, FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>Such I would name it, becau&s;e an increa&s;ed action of the va&s;cu|lar &s;y&s;tem, and fullne&s;s of blood, are the immediate cau&s;es.</P>
<P>This fever is &s;ometimes of very &s;light duration, terminating in one, at mo&s;t, in three or four days, and &s;eldom requiring any medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. It makes its attack very often &s;uddenly.</P>
<P>There is a &s;light coldne&s;s&mdash;the whole body grows red, parti|cularly the face, attended with &s;ome turge&s;cence, and a vapour|ous warmth. The head-ach comes on &s;uddenly, the temples throb, the breathing is frequent, the pul&s;e free, uninterrupted, quick, and full. <HI>In the decline</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e, there appears a breathing &s;weat, with no remarkable change in the urine.</P>
<P>CAUSES. Whatever will &s;upernaturally increa&s;e the action of the ve&s;&s;els, and induce too great fullne&s;s of blood in the habit, as errors in diet, too violent exerci&s;e, cold, &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome natural di&s;charge, retention of &s;ome acrid matters offen&s;ive in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, from &s;ome external injury, happening in an health|ful con&s;titution.</P>
<P>CURE. Medical aid is &s;eldom in the&s;e ca&s;es nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;na|ture mo&s;t commonly is the phy&s;ician. Drinking copiou&s;ly of watery liquids warm, &s;uch as tea, weak broths, lemonade, &s;mall negus; ab&s;taining from all &s;olid food; and lying in bed to encou|rage per&s;piration, will be all that is requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>Or, if medicine mu&s;t be employed, &s;aline mixtures, or nitrous powders, may be had recour&s;e to. (No. 1, 2.)</P>
<P>But &s;hould the fever put on more violent appearances&mdash;&s;hould the pul&s;e not only be full, but rather hard, with any con&s;idera|ble degree of oppre&s;&s;ion and heat, and the &s;kin dry; bleeding, according to the patient's &s;trength, to the quantity of eight, ten,
<PB N="206" REF="028021_0202_0FD671A585DF9DC8">
or twelve ounces, may be advi&s;ed&mdash;and, in ca&s;e of co&s;tivene&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cooling &s;aline purgative (No. 3.) may be admini&s;tered, to produce three or four evacuations; and in order to appea&s;e any hurry which perhaps it may occa&s;ion, a quieting draught in the even|ing. (No. 4, 5.)</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the&s;e &s;hould not &s;ucceed to our wi&s;h, and the &s;ymp|toms before recited increa&s;e, the pul&s;e excepted with re&s;pect to its fullne&s;s and hardne&s;s, the&s;e being in &s;ome degree abated; and the patient has pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;tle&s;s night; we mu&s;t then fly to anti|monials, as the mo&s;t effectual in checking the violence of the fe|ver. The mo&s;t eligible of which are, tartarized antimony, for|merly called tartar emetic, or the antimonial powder of the la&s;t London Di&s;pen&s;atory, a medicine an&s;wering every purpo&s;e of Dr. James's Powder. (No. 6 to 9.)</P>
<P>The fir&s;t do&s;e of the mixture, (No. 8.) or the &s;econd, if it meets with any foulne&s;s of the &s;tomach, generally excites vomiting, which &s;hould be encouraged by copious draughts of chamomile, or weak green tea, or thin gruel&mdash;and afterwards the mixture continued.</P>
<P>It produces al&s;o in general a gentle &s;weat. One or two eva|cuations by &s;tool, quiets the pul&s;e, takes off the oppre&s;&s;ion and nau&s;ea; this, by its continuance, and ordering balm tea, barley|water, or &s;ome &s;uch diluting liquor, to be drank plentifully, ba|ni&s;h, in common ca&s;es, every complaint.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e efforts, &s;hould things wear a more unpromi&s;ing a&s;pect&mdash;&s;hould the &s;ickne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion con|tinue; the thir&s;t, heat, and dryne&s;s of the &s;kin increa&s;e; head-ach become intolerable; the patient very re&s;tle&s;s; the pul&s;e keep up, or increa&s;e in fullne&s;s and hardne&s;s particularly, more blood mu&s;t be taken away&mdash;though, &s;hould there be indications of great debility, and the pul&s;e flag and grow low, it mu&s;t be avoid|ed&mdash;the feet may be put in warm water&mdash;and, in continuing the antimonials, great care mu&s;t be taken that they do not operate too violently upwards or downwards, for the&s;e would aggravate the &s;ymptoms, or bring on a train of others of more &s;erious con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, in&s;tead of the &s;aline mixture be|fore pre&s;cribed, the neutral volatile &s;aline (No. 10.) is more eli|gible, becau&s;e this, I think, determines more freely to the &s;kin&mdash;and, trifling as the alteration may appear, I have &s;een changes obviou&s;ly for the better on its being admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the above caution, if emetics have been e|mitted in the beginning, particularly if there has been any &s;ick|ne&s;s or nau&s;ea, they may be given at any period of the di&s;ea&s;e, if the &s;trength of the patient will admit. (No, 11, 12.)</P>

SYDENHAM &s;ays, <Q>If any one &s;hould inquire at what time of the fever I would have a vomit admini&s;tered. I &s;ay po&s;itively, at the beginning; but &s;hould we be called in &s;o late, which is often the ca&s;e, that we could not at the beginning give a vo|mit to the patient for their relief, yet certainly I thought it expedient that it might be done at any time of the fever, if the di&s;ea&s;e has not &s;o reduced the &s;trength, that its violence cannot be borne&mdash;I have, continues he, ordered a vomit without he&s;itation on the twelfth day of a fever, when all the retchings had cea&s;ed; nor was it unattended with advan|tage.</Q></P>
<P>But, to return to our &s;ubject. If, by the u&s;e of antimonials, the body &s;hould not be kept properly open, gly&s;ters, (No. 25, 26.) &s;hould &s;upply the defect, admini&s;tered in the evening.</P>
<P>From this treatment, a continued fever of this kind &s;eldom remains longer than the fifth day; but &s;hould it pur&s;ue its cour&s;e to any later period, it is difficult to determine at what time it will cea&s;e.</P>
<P>Here we mu&s;t be extremely cautious in our progno&s;tic, both with re&s;pect to its duration and danger; for there are often in the con&s;titution many latent mi&s;chiefs which do not &s;hew them|&s;elves; or &s;ome, which manife&s;t them&s;elves not immediately, may be brought upon the internal and vital parts by the febrile exertions, that when we have a right to expect every favour|able conclu&s;ion, the&s;e &s;uddenly prevent the operations of nature, and in an in&s;tant overturn all our flattering pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>However, if this fever goes not off on the fifth day, it &s;eldom continues longer than the fourteenth&mdash;during that &s;pace, we are then to endeavour &s;o to regulate the moving powers of the &s;o|lids, that they may neither act too powerfully nor too weakly&mdash;hence are they to be &s;upported in a &s;tate of moderation&mdash;and this we do by thin diet, &s;ubacid drinks, &s;uch as the &s;tomach can bear and reli&s;h; as thin gruels, roa&s;ted apples, oranges, boiled tur|nips, and &s;uch like, continuing, under various forms, the u&s;e of the antimonial &s;aline mixture.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the attention we have to pay to the &s;y&s;tem in general, &s;ometimes the head, &s;tomach, and bowels require our notice, in order to alleviate the particular affections under which they la|bour&mdash;for the head now and then is greatly di&s;ordered&mdash;bli&s;ters applied between the &s;houlders, bathing and fomenting the &s;ect with warm water, bring in the&s;e ca&s;es relief, and di&s;po&s;e the pa|tient to re&s;t.</P>
<P>If &s;ourne&s;s &s;hould affect the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, creating pain and flatulence, we &s;hould unite with our medicines &s;ome of the ab&s;orbent earths, as magne&s;ia, chalk, hart&s;horn, crabs eyes

or claws prepared, according as the habit is di&s;po&s;ed to co&s;tive|ne&s;s, or otherwi&s;e&mdash;under the fir&s;t circum&s;tance, magne&s;ia&mdash;un|der the la&s;t, prepared hart&s;horn claims the preference.</P>
<P>In the manner above recited &s;hould we go on as occa&s;ion may require, till nature throws off her oppre&s;&s;ive load at &s;ome of her accu&s;tomed periods, which will be either on the &s;eventh, ninth, eleventh, or fourteenth day commonly&mdash;or, if the fever is of lon|ger duration, &s;eventeenth or twentieth. After this period they are &s;eldom ob&s;erved with any accuracy.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e towards the clo&s;e the &s;trength of the con&s;titution appears to be in a debilitated &s;tate, the pul&s;e begins to &s;ink, and the machine requires &s;ome &s;timulus, in order to rou&s;e it to, and pre&s;erve its action&mdash;here we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to &s;uch appli|cations as will invigorate the &s;y&s;tem; our former drinks and medicines mu&s;t be altered; we mu&s;t now give wine and water, white wine whey, or pure wine&mdash;or, if medicines are prefer|ed, cordial, camphorated and &s;timulant medicines (No. 13 to 18.)</P>
<P>But wine will be&s;t an&s;wer the purpo&s;es we require, as it is con&s;idered to be the mo&s;t grateful cordial with which we are acquainted.</P>
<P>However, if any others are thought more eligible than what we have &s;elected, the cla&s;s of &s;timulants will &s;upply a &s;atisfactory variety.</P>
<P>Before we clo&s;e it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that much cau|tion is nece&s;&s;ary in pronouncing the approach of a cri&s;is, or ter|mination, or its perfect completion&mdash;for it &s;ometimes begins and recedes.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion we &s;hould take the &s;ymptoms collectively; and, if they all appear favourable, wait for their continuance; for they will begin on one critical day, and not be complete till the next. If, therefore, the pul&s;e becomes &s;oft and full, and &s;ub&s;ides daily, &s;omething below a healthful &s;tandard&mdash;the urine depo&s;its a &s;ediment to the bottom of the gla&s;s, or, on &s;haking, it &s;ub&s;ides&mdash;the &s;kin becomes &s;oft, and a general &s;weat &s;ucceeds&mdash;if the patient's &s;en&s;es return after having &s;lept, we may ven|ture to pronounce boldly.</P>
<P>After matters are brought to this plea&s;ing conclu&s;ion a do&s;e or two or phy&s;ic may be exhibited. (No. 19, 20, 21.)</P>
<P>The patient &s;hould return gradually to his accu&s;tomed cour&s;e of life, le&s;t he &s;hould, by throwing food into the habit in too large quantities, oppre&s;s the dige&s;tive powers, which, with the re&s;t of the body, mu&s;t be in a &s;tate of too great debility to per|form their functions vigorou&s;ly. His, diet, therefore, &s;hould not only be &s;mall in quantity, but of the lighte&s;t &s;ort; becau&s;e, from vi&s;cid food, the machine would labour under the &s;ame in|conveniences

as above &s;pecified&mdash;he &s;hould eat often, but &s;par|ingly, take fre&s;h air, and u&s;e moderate exerci&s;e, &s;uch as his &s;trength will admit, but never pur&s;ue it to fatigue him&s;elf.

<HEAD>&sect; 2. INFLAMMATORY, or VASCULO-SANGUINEOUS INFLAMMATORY FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>Becau&s;e not only the &s;ame circum&s;tances occur as in the former fever, with regard to the increa&s;ed action of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, and fullne&s;s of blood&mdash;but the ve&s;&s;els have acquired a &s;uperna|tural firmne&s;s, and the blood too great tenacity, by which I un|der&s;tand an in inflammatory di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. The patients at fir&s;t feel as if they were wearied and had been beaten; are apparently weak, and have cold and hot &s;its alternating with each other; they tremble, and feel pains all over them, particularly in the &s;houlders, back, knees, and head: to the&s;e &s;ucceed an inten&s;e and burning heat, unextingui&s;hable thir&s;t; their eyes appear inflamed, with a red|ne&s;s and fullne&s;s of the face; they are &s;ick and vomit; are al&s;o re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y; the pul&s;e is full and &s;trong; the &s;kin dry; the urine for the mo&s;t part high coloured, but &s;ometimes like water; the tongue rough, dry, brown or black, and furred; blood drawn is very tenacious, and, on &s;tanding, covered with a coriaceous &s;ub&s;tance like buff-leather; they breathe with diffi|culty; the body is co&s;tive; they &s;ometimes cough; are very watchful and delirious; a &s;tupor and drow&s;ine&s;s come on; at la&s;t tremblings, twitching of the tendons, hiccough, and an invo|luntary emi&s;&s;ion of faeces and urine clo&s;e the fatal &s;cene. With regard to the heat, it is of a particular kind, which, though it affects the touch very &s;en&s;ibly at fir&s;t, yet &s;eems to grow le&s;s violent the longer we hold the hand upon the &s;kin of the pati|ent.</P>
<P>As to the pul&s;e, its hardne&s;s, &s;trength, and fullne&s;s, are in greater degrees than are to be met with in any other &s;pecies of fever.</P>
<P>And the urine is not only high coloured, but &s;harp, and in &s;mall quantities.</P>
<P>CAUSES. Tho&s;e which are called <HI>the remote or inducing,</HI> are &s;aid to be, per&s;piration ob&s;tructed; &s;udden cold; too much expo&s;ure to the &s;trong heat of the &s;un; fatigue; anger; hard drinking; too long watching; cold water drank whil&s;t the ma|chine is hot; or, in &s;ine, whatever can put the ve&s;&s;el into too &s;trong and quick action, and for &s;ome time continue it.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="028021_0206_0FD671A5D2A0A958">
The <HI>proximate or immediate,</HI> acrid and tenacious blood ob|&s;tructing the very minute, &s;erous, and &s;anguinary ve&s;&s;els in dif|ferent places and increa&s;ed &s;trength and activity of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, which the remote cau&s;es are concluded to confirm, as well as the appearances of blood taken away&mdash;the &s;ymptoms&mdash;mode of cure&mdash;and the in&s;pection of dead bodies on di&s;&s;ection&mdash;for in them the vi&s;cera are found in a &s;tate of inflammation and mortification.</P>
<P>Young people in the vigour of life, ru&s;tles, &s;anguineous habits, free luxurious livers, and all tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;trong &s;tamina and tenacity of the circulating fluids, are mo&s;t prone to fall into this fever.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. This fever generally at|tacks tho&s;e who are formed with &s;trong vigorous &s;tamina and den&s;e blood:&mdash;it is conci&s;ely defined, a great increa&s;e of natural heat, a frequent, &s;trong, hard pul&s;e, high-coloured urine, &s;ome|times watery, and the functions of the &s;en&s;orium a little di&s;turb|ed.</P>
<P>CURE. This is performed by weakening the &s;trength and activity of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, le&s;&s;ening the violence of their action, and thinning the blood.</P>
<P>If we were to remove the irritating cau&s;e &s;oon after it had ex|erted its action, there is no doubt but every good con&s;equence would accrue; but that we cannot do in all ca&s;es, particularly when morbid particles have got &s;o blended with the juices, that &s;ome time is required before they can be properly prepared for being thrown out of the body;&mdash;or, after the increa&s;ed action had continued &s;o long, that it had by its effects contaminated the fluids; we therefore endeavour to put the frame in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion, that no violent mi&s;chief &s;hall be created by the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e; and thus give nature an opportunity of exerting her &s;alutary efforts with effect, and enable her to throw out the of|fen&s;ive materials from the ma&s;s of fluids.</P>
<P>For which purpo&s;e, if called in in the early &s;tage, we depend upon bleeding copiou&s;ly, and repeat it agreeable to the patient's &s;trength, until the pul&s;e is reduced to its proper &s;tandard&mdash;nor mu&s;t we be deceived by the apparent oppre&s;&s;ion of the pul&s;e, for by bleeding it becomes &s;tronger&mdash;indeed <HI>apparent</HI> weakne&s;s and lo&s;s of &s;trength proceed &s;ometimes from too great fullne&s;s; &s;o that the volume of fluids &s;eems too powerful for va&s;cular action; and unle&s;s this oppre&s;&s;ion is taken off, which bleeding mo&s;t rea|dily accompli&s;hes, we &s;hould run the ri&s;que of their total ce&s;&s;a|tion. Indeed, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary is this operation at the on&s;et of the&s;e fevers, that if it is omitted, the neglect can &s;eldom be recovered during the whole cour&s;e.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t proper before the fourth or fifth day, but, under

&s;ome circum&s;tances, it may be performed at a later period&mdash;in difficult and oppre&s;&s;ed breathing&mdash;violent pain of the head, with high delirium, &s;ucceeded by drow&s;ine&s;s, in full and &s;trong habits&mdash;for the&s;e &s;ymptoms indicate an inflammation of the lungs, or a &s;uperabundant load of blood in the brain.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding it <HI>may be right</HI> in any &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, it is only to be advi&s;ed with extreme caution; for if this operation is carried to exce&s;s, &s;o as greatly to weaken the patient, nature may be di&s;qualified for throwing off the morbid matter at the time when the cri&s;is &s;hould come on; which matter is mo&s;t na|turally carried out of the body, either by di&s;charges from the inte&s;tines, kidneys, or the pores of the &s;kin.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the nece&s;&s;ity of repeating the bleeding, we are to be directed by the urgency and continuance of the &s;ymptoms: therefore after the fir&s;t bleeding in &s;ix or eight hours, if the pul&s;e &s;hould be nearly or equally as hard and quick as before, and the other febrile &s;ymptoms &s;imilar, it may be repeated, though in &s;maller quantity, and even a third or fourth time, or more, un|der &s;imilar circum&s;tances, may be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>We are next to advert to the &s;tate of the &s;tomach and bowels:&mdash;if there &s;hould be any oppre&s;&s;ion, nau&s;ea, &s;ickne&s;s, flatulence, or weight at the pit of the &s;tomach, or fullne&s;s there&mdash;&s;hould the body be co&s;tive, we &s;hould attempt immediately to clear them of their contents by emetics, (No. 11.) and gentle purgatives. (No. 3. 22 to 24.)</P>
<P>But &s;hould there be any inflammation of the &s;tomach or inte&s;|tines, vomits mu&s;t be by all means avoided, as they might be &s;uc|ceeded by the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>But &s;hould not any of the above &s;ymptoms occur, we mu&s;t then endeavour only to take off the &s;pa&s;modic affections of the &s;kin, and promote per&s;piration, by creating gentle vomiting or nau&s;ea, by admini&s;tering &s;light do&s;es of antimonials alone, or mixed with &s;aline mixture. (No. 6, 7, 8, 9) Warm watery li|quids &s;hould be drank copiou&s;ly, the legs and thighs fomented with flannels wrung out of warm water, or the &s;ame liquid thrown in by way of gly&s;ter; for the&s;e are highly beneficial in thinning the blood, and relaxing the too ten&s;e fibres. And here we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that bleeding, where nece&s;&s;ary, &s;hould always be performed before we exhibit a vomit, in order to take off the general fullne&s;s of the habit, and prevent any conge&s;tion or ob|&s;tructions taking place by its operation in the brain.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e of co&s;tivene&s;s, we &s;hould add &s;mall do&s;es of tartarized or vitriolated kali, tartarized natron to the antimonials, (No. 6, 7, 8, 9.) ca&s;&s;ia draught, cry&s;tals of tartar whey, or infu&s;ion of ta|marinds may be admini&s;tered. (No. 22, 23, 24.)</P>

<P>Ab&s;tinence, as long as the &s;trength will permit, &s;hould be ad|vi&s;ed; but if that becomes defective, it &s;hould be &s;upported on|ly by the mo&s;t light liquid food.

<P>The room in which the patient lies &s;hould be &s;pacious, and well ventilated with cool fre&s;h air, impregnated with vinegar, the effluvia of fre&s;h flowers, and a free circulation con&s;tantly per|mitted; taking care &s;o to di&s;po&s;e the patient, that &s;trong cur|rents may be avoided.</P>
<P>The bed-cloaths &s;hould only, as in health, be moderate, the curtains not clo&s;e drawn; and, in fine, every thing heating, and which can increa&s;e the force and quickne&s;s of the pul&s;e, mu&s;t be prohibited.</P>
<P>The patient &s;hould now and then be got up, he will be render|ed le&s;s re&s;tle&s;s, pre&s;erve his &s;trength more, and not &s;o &s;ubject to

increa&s;e of head-ach and delirium; for, by &s;itting up in an erect po&s;ture, the blood will circulate with le&s;s force towards the brain, than in an horizontal &s;ituation; and ob&s;tructions will not be &s;o liable to be formed there, nor will the brain be &s;o likely to &s;uffer depre&s;&s;ion from a load of fluids.</P>

<P>Others are of opinion, that they never can be right <HI>though a delirium &s;hould come on,</HI> if the pul&s;e keeps full, hard, and quick; but think the head is better relieved by bathing the feet in warm water, or applying cloths &s;queezed out of it to them, and the in|&s;ide of the thigh ju&s;t above the knee&mdash;for the nervous &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t be di&s;turbed and agitated too freely where the heat conti|nues great, the &s;kin dry, with the pul&s;e as repre&s;ented&mdash;hence bli&s;|ters, while &s;uch &s;ymptoms appear, and the fibres are too ten&s;e, will increa&s;e the mi&s;chief, from the additional &s;timulus they oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>In delicate con&s;titutions, where there is great pronene&s;s to nervous incitability, and mu&s;cular irritability rather de|fective, bli&s;ters may be u&s;eful, by regulating the motion of the nervous power, and not being capable of producing any great effect on the mu&s;cular fibres&mdash;but, in &s;trong athletic habits, I &s;hould think the practice dangerous; but yet, where the pul&s;e in any con&s;titution grows &s;oft, and begins to flag, either from e|vacuations, or weakne&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem, brought on in the cour&s;e of the fever, <HI>particularly if attended with drow&s;ine&s;s, or di&s;po&s;ition to con&s;tant &s;lumbering,</HI> towards the height or turn of the lever, at that time they will be found extremely beneficial&mdash;by rou&s;ing the nervous &s;y&s;tem, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting nature in producing a &s;eparation and ejection of the morbid cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Should what we have before advi&s;ed prove ineffectual in pre|venting co&s;tivene&s;s, as more powerful purgatives would be apt to rai&s;e too great a commotion, and impede nature in her &s;aluta|tary efforts, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to gly&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rs. (No. 25, 26.)</P>
<P>Towards the evening, in almo&s;t all acute complaints, every &s;ymptom increa&s;es much with re&s;pect to violence, and towards the morning abates; but when the turn of the fever is at hand, the violence continues more uniform throughout, nature appear|ing to exert her utmo&s;t efforts to conquer the di&s;ea&s;e, by throw|ing off the offending matter&mdash;hence the agitation of the whole machine is extremely &s;evere.</P>
<P>If now the &s;kin grows &s;oft and moi&s;t, the tongue lo&s;es its dry|ne&s;s, the urine begins to depo&s;it a whiti&s;h &s;ediment, and becomes le&s;s high coloured, and &s;oon after a more profu&s;e &s;weat breaks

out, the other &s;ymptoms abating of their violence, we may ex|pect a happy termination, &s;hould the&s;e occur upon a critical day, particularly if a &s;ound &s;leep comes on, followed by refre&s;hment, lo&s;s of thir&s;t, the tongue clearing away its foulne&s;s, and the head alleviated from its pain and unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>From the&s;e appearances we may conclude a cri&s;is is begun; and in its progre&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the pul&s;e grow gradually &s;lower, falling &s;ome &s;trokes in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nute below its healthful &s;tandard, we may be a&s;&s;ured that things have taken a favourable turn, and that the patient is &s;ecure from danger.</P>
<P>But during this conte&s;t in the critical period, which will be for &s;ome days from the beginning to its termination, cordials may be thought nece&s;&s;ary, the be&s;t of which is wine, given alone or in whey. If medicines to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e are thought more agreeable, to what we have delivered from No. 13 to 18, may be added other cordials.</P>
<P>But if I find nature in her critical intention points more to the kidneys than to the &s;kin I prefer joining the cordials to the &s;o|lution of prepared kali and lemon juice, (No. 1.) if to the &s;kin, to that of prepared ammonia. (No. 27.)</P>
<P>But &s;ometimes, from all our efforts, we are not even flattered with a favourable i&s;&s;ue&mdash;however we mu&s;t not de&s;pair&mdash;nature often relieves her&s;elf at the moment we lea&s;t expect it.</P>
<P>Therefore, when the con&s;titution &s;eems drooping, and nature appears almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, when general tremors come on, twitch|ing of the tendons, delirium, and the patient parts with both faeces and urine involuntarily&mdash;which appearances are always con&s;idered to be the re&s;ult of &s;trong nervous affections, giving the di&s;ea&s;e the mo&s;t unhappy a&s;pect&mdash;in the deplorable &s;tate we depend upon the repetition of bli&s;ters, applied in the following &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: 1&s;t, to the back&mdash;2d, under the arms&mdash;3d, above the wri&s;ts&mdash;4th, above the knees on the in&s;ide of the thighs&mdash;and, 5th, upon the head, if violent pain and much di&s;turbance there, points out the rectitude of &s;uch an application&mdash;and likewi&s;e mu&s;tard poultices, called finapi&s;ms, to the feet, (No. 30.) and give vola|tile &s;alts&mdash;camphor&mdash;mu&s;k, (No. 31 to 35.) in order to allay &s;ome of tho&s;e convul&s;ive affections which pre&s;ent them&s;elves at this period&mdash;for which mu&s;k mixed with valerian is e&s;teemed highly u&s;eful.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es of extreme languor, &s;nake-root is a very valuable medicine, which may be given in infu&s;ion or powder. (No. 36, 37.)</P>

<P>Sometimes in this di&s;ea&s;e, at an early period, people will be much afflicted with the head-ach, delirium, watching, or drow|&s;ine&s;s, bleeding at the temples with leeches&mdash;applying bli&s;ters there&mdash;having the head &s;haved and rubbed with vinegar&mdash;or portions of the lungs of a lamb applied warm to the head&mdash;bli&s;tering and fomenting the legs, and applying mu&s;tard poul|tices to the &s;oles of the feet, are u&s;eful auxliaries to the general mode of cure above &s;pecified&mdash;as is al&s;o bli&s;tering the head:&mdash;or &s;hould they have any pains &s;imilar to tho&s;e of pleuritic people, applying a bli&s;ter over the part affected is beneficial.</P>
<P>Sometimes rheumatic affections will be a concomitant&mdash;in this ca&s;e, large do&s;es of nitre will be u&s;eful&mdash;and &s;hould any dy&s;en|teric appearances, &s;uch as unea&s;y pains in the bowels, propen|&s;ity to go to &s;tool, without producing any evacuation; a grain or two or ipecacuanha, given now and then, may act as gentle aperient, &s;olicit the di&s;charge of the irritating matter, and carry it out of the bowels. To me it obviou&s;ly appears, that the&s;e applications are only to alleviate the &s;ymptoms ari&s;ing from the local affection of a part, from a more general cau&s;e; whil&s;t, at the &s;ame time, we mu&s;t per&s;i&s;t in the general mode of cure;&mdash;why we endeavour at their particular alleviation, is to prevent nature from being di&s;turbed in her operations by the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing or anamalous &s;ymptoms; as by inattention to them the dan|ger might be increa&s;ed, and the malady prolonged; for the&s;e &s;ymptoms, for the mo&s;t part, are &s;ubdued by time alone, and the fever being kept within proper limits.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; 3. NERVOUS FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>This is &s;o named becau&s;e the <HI>nervous &s;y&s;tem</HI> appears to be the part mo&s;t affected. It differs from the inflammatory fever in the part of the con&s;titution attacked, and occurs in &s;uch as are di&s;&s;imilar. Here the nervous &s;y&s;tem is defective, attended with little or no inten&s;ene&s;s of va&s;cular motion; blood al&s;o poor and thin, and the nerves extremely incitable. This is al&s;o called the &s;low fever, becau&s;e it is &s;low in its progre&s;s compared with other fevers, paticularly the foregoing.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. This fever makes its attack with dejec|tion of &s;pirits&mdash;lo&s;s of appetite&mdash;oppre&s;&s;ion&mdash;di&s;turbed &s;leep, or re&s;t|le&s;&s;ne&s;s&mdash;the patient often &s;ighs and groans involuntarily&mdash;is fre|quently terrified, and affected with uncommon la&s;&s;itude after ex|erci&s;e, tho' that &s;hould be &s;light, and at the &s;ame time has cold and hot &s;its &s;ucceed, and alternate with each other&mdash;he is troubled
<PB N="216" REF="028021_0212_0FD671B11EBDBC58">
with nau&s;ea, and a vomiting of in&s;ipid phlegm, which come on in a few days after the attack, with giddine&s;s and pain of the head&mdash;extreme pro&s;tration of &s;trength&mdash;no remarkable heat&mdash;no thir&s;t&mdash;the pul&s;e is frequent, weak, and &s;ometimes intermits&mdash;the tongue continues moi&s;t, white and is covered over with a vi&s;cid mucus&mdash;there is an oppre&s;&s;ion at the pit of the &s;tomach, and the breathing difficult&mdash;the urine is pale, watery, and &s;ometimes like milk whey&mdash;the face red, and flu&s;hes, at the &s;ame time that the feet are cold&mdash;the mind is &s;lightly di&s;turbed by ridiculous imagina|tions, which continues, but without any violent delirium &s;ome|times immoderate &s;weats break out, or colliquative, di&s;&s;olving loo&s;ene&s;s comes on&mdash;the &s;en&s;es lo&s;e their quickne&s;s, and become dull and heavy&mdash;with anxiety and fainting attending.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e, when nature appears almo&s;t worn out by the continuance of the di&s;ea&s;e; the tongue trembles&mdash;the extre|mities grow cold&mdash;the nails livid&mdash;they lo&s;e the power of &s;ight and hearing&mdash;the delirium is converted into &s;tupor, and a lethargic di&s;|po&s;ition&mdash;the faeces and urine pa&s;s away involuntarily&mdash;twitching of the tendons comes on&mdash;and generally convul&s;ions clo&s;e the &s;cene, in death.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing cau&s;es</HI> are &s;aid to be re|laxed fibres, and a weak nervous &s;y&s;tem&mdash;too powerful evacua|tions&mdash;&s;alivations from taking mercury too frequently repeated&mdash;immoderate venery&mdash;mental affliction&mdash;watching, and noctur|nal &s;tudy&mdash;moi&s;t and &s;tagnant air of &s;ubterraneous jails and con|fined places; a crude and too thin diet, particularly of cold and watery fruit&mdash;watery and vi&s;cid drinks&mdash;rainy &s;ea&s;ons&mdash;a moi&s;t and loft winter&mdash;and, in fine, all tho&s;e things which by &s;low de|grees debilitate the nervous &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The <HI>proximate</HI> or <HI>immediate,</HI> great apparent incitability in the nervous &s;y&s;tem&mdash;a lentor, and vi&s;cidity of the &s;erum, lymph&mdash;and thin humours with acrimony from contagion or ob&s;truction&mdash;and a torpor, or defect of inten&s;ene&s;s of motion in the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem; which are obvious from the blood taken away&mdash;phlegm thrown up from the &s;tomach&mdash;and appearances agreeing with di&s;ea&s;es a|ri&s;ing from corrupted and contaminated &s;erum. Hence it is &s;up|po&s;ed to exert its influence upon the mo&s;t minute, &s;erous, lym|phatic, and nervous ve&s;&s;els; but rather upon the whole brain, as the pale wan colour, palene&s;s and dryne&s;s of ulcers, a deprivation of the &s;en&s;es, extreme debility, and &s;uppurations in the brain up|on di&s;&s;ection, point out.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. In defining this di&s;ea&s;e, I &s;hould &s;ay, it was an affection of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, in which there was apparent incitability, with a thickne&s;s of the &s;erum, lymph, and thin humours&mdash;a torpor, or defect of inten&s;ene&s;s of
<PB N="217" REF="028021_0213_0FD671F376F67328">
motion in the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, independent of nervous incitabi|lity, di&s;coverable by &s;light chills&mdash;&s;hivering&mdash;and uncertain flu&s;h|ings of heat&mdash;&s;inking and dejection of &s;pirits&mdash;frequent involun|tary &s;ighing&mdash;general weakne&s;s&mdash;quick irregular pul&s;e&mdash;pale co|loured urine&mdash;remarkable propen&s;ity to &s;pa&s;modic affections&mdash;no di&s;tre&s;&s;ing thir&s;t&mdash;&s;ometimes retching, though nothing but &s;imple phlegm evacuated.</P>
<P>CURE. As affections of this kind will ari&s;e from different kinds of foulne&s;s in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, if we are called in early, its progre&s;s is ea&s;ily prevented, by gentle emetic, (No. 11, 12.) and &s;mall do&s;es of rhubarb, manna, ca&s;tor oil, and &s;ome &s;uch gen|tle aperients, (&s;ee Emollient, and a&s;tringent Aperients, under Cathartics, page, 172.)&mdash;but if in too advanced a &s;tate, when the fever is completely formed, which is almo&s;t always the ca&s;e, it will pur&s;ue its cour&s;e in &s;pite of all our endeavours.</P>
<P>The indications of cure, are to guard the habit &s;o far, that the wor&s;t effects may be prevented; and, as in inflammatory fevers, we endeavour to weaken the &s;y&s;tem, we mu&s;t in this attempt to invigorate the con&s;titution, and &s;upport it by mild and proper cordial &s;timulants, not given at fir&s;t of too powerful a na|ture.</P>
<P>Bleeding, apt to be applied on &s;light occa&s;ions, is here almo&s;t always injurious, no di&s;ea&s;e bearing that operation &s;o badly. At the attack, we &s;hould wait for nature pointing out the preci&s;e di&s;po&s;ition of the malady. Sometimes, indeed, in &s;ome epide|mic con&s;titutions of the air, when at the commencement it attacks habits which are full of blood, putting on the appearance of in|flammatory affection, a few ounces may be taken away, but not repeated.</P>
<P>Where there &s;eems to be a determination of blood to the head, di&s;covered by pain, heavine&s;s, and giddine&s;s there, as &s;ometimes happens, leeches may be applied to the temples; or cupping at the back part of the head may be had recour&s;e to; but not on trivial occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome &s;ymptoms which &s;hew them&s;elves, &s;uch as dif|ficult and oppre&s;&s;ed breathing, and are called perip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eumonic; but the&s;e ari&s;e not from an inflammatory cau&s;e; as the breath is nor hot, nor is there any cough, nor different degrees of pain; but the pul&s;e is &s;mall and contracted, and the extremities cold&mdash;the&s;e &s;hew the affections to be nervous, not va&s;cular;&mdash;bleeding would therefore be highly injurious. From their local, as well as general effects, mild emetics are certainly u&s;eful, from unloading the &s;tomach of any vi&s;cid materials, and giving an opportunity for medicines to communicate their effects to the habit and nervous &s;y&s;tem more freely, by having the internal coat of that organ
<PB N="218" REF="028021_0214_0FD671B303997A70">
more openly expo&s;ed to their action&mdash;and here ipecacuanha is pre|ferable to tartarized antimony, as it weakens le&s;s the influence of the nervous &s;y&s;tem. (No. 38.)</P>
<P>The body &s;hould be kept open by gentle aperients (172) <HI>only,</HI> as common purges at the on&s;et have produced &s;inking of the &s;pi|rits, faintings, and other di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms&mdash;or dome&s;tic gly&s;|&s;ters, (No. 25.) may be admini&s;tered, in ca&s;e of co&s;tivene&s;s, eve|ry &s;econd or third day.</P>
<P>Bli&s;ters applied through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;uc|ceeding one another, with moderately cordial and diaphoretic medicines, (No. 27 to 29.) and a well-regulated diet, are what mu&s;t be chiefly depended upon; for the&s;e di&s;&s;olve the vi&s;cidity of the &s;erum, invigorate the &s;y&s;tem, and render the nerves more uniform and powerful in their action&mdash;hence promote in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, or a gentle moi&s;ture on the &s;urface of the body; but they &s;hould not be pu&s;hed &s;o far as to induce profu&s;e &s;weat|ing, for a continued &s;weat exa&s;perates the fever.</P>
<P>To the diet we &s;hould be particularly attentive, in order to &s;upport the &s;trength of the patient; for the&s;e fevers are apt to be of long duration; and this &s;hould be of the &s;timulant, cordial, and nutritious kind&mdash;of which the &s;ick &s;hould be &s;olicited, to take frequently in moderate quantity.</P>
<P>White wine whey, thin gruel with wine in it, may be u&s;ed freely, or wine and water&mdash;and particularly towards the termi|nation, chicken broth, beef-tea, thin jellies of hart&s;horn, &s;ago, and panada with wine. Indeed wine alone may be liberally ad|mini&s;tered, e&s;pecially if the pul&s;e grows &s;oft upon its u&s;e, if there &s;hould be lowne&s;s, with a &s;oftne&s;s of the pul&s;e, and a low drow&s;y delirium; for under the&s;e circum&s;tances it produces &s;leep. I have known patients, particularly one lady, take three pints in 24 hours with advantage; but it has been affirmed, &s;ome quarts have been given in the &s;ame &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>All the liquids, if de&s;ired, may be drank cold, as they are only nece&s;&s;ary to be prohibited in ca&s;es of local inflamma|tion.</P>
<P>There is little doubt but a judicious and well-regulated diet, with the u&s;e of bli&s;ters, well-timed and well-applied, will per|form a cure&mdash;taking care to keep the patient as quiet as po&s;&s;ible both in body and mind&mdash;He &s;hould be kept only of a moderate warmth, neither expo&s;ed to too great heat or cold; and his &s;pi|rits exhilirated as much as po&s;&s;ible, by con&s;olatory conver&s;ation of his medical attendants, and certain promi&s;es of recovery, di&s;&s;i|pating all gloomy or unplea&s;ant ideas.</P>
<P>With regard to the application of bli&s;ters, &s;o great appears to be their u&s;e, that &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary rules &s;hould be pointed out.&mdash;They 
<PB N="219" REF="028021_0215_0FD671F4F47BDA20">
&s;hould certainly, in order to reap the greate&s;t benefit, be applied at fir&s;t, as &s;oon as we know the preci&s;e nature of the ma|lady; but if neglected till the &s;y&s;tem manife&s;ts high degrees of incitability, di&s;coverable from acutene&s;s of &s;ight, touch, and hear|ing; they mu&s;t be omitted till &s;ome degree of in&s;en&s;ibility makes its approach&mdash;for, <HI>in the fir&s;t in&s;tance,</HI> they may prevent the ac|ce&s;&s;ion, or alleviate the violence of the &s;ymptoms&mdash;<HI>in the &s;econd,</HI> they would increa&s;e them before the period &s;tated.</P>
<P>As the bli&s;ters are only applied to promote &s;timulus, not any evacuation, becau&s;e that would tend to debilitate the &s;y&s;tem, and be of di&s;&s;ervice; therefore, as &s;oon as the bli&s;ter is fully rai&s;ed, it &s;hould be cut, the aqueous fluid let out, and nothing applied to the part to increa&s;e the di&s;charge. In the fir&s;t in&s;tance, &s;ome have advi&s;ed them to be put upon the legs; but, in ca&s;e of drow|&s;ine&s;s and &s;tupor, upon the head, and &s;inapi&s;ms to the feet; to which &s;hould the la&s;t give too great pain, they may be chang|ed for poultices of milk and bread.</P>
<P>In order to relieve the peripneumonic &s;ymptoms, (217) bli&s;|ters to the arms, thighs, or legs are proper, with gentle cordial medicines, (No. 13 to 15.) with the addition of acetated ammo|nia, or the cordial &s;aline draught, (No. 27.) may be admini&s;tered, cordial mixtures, or julep occa&s;ionally, (No. 13, to 15. 28, 29) or &s;al volatile, from 20 to 40 drops in mu&s;tard whey.</P>
<P>After the continuation of this fever for ten or twelve days, or longer, &s;hould a remi&s;&s;ion come on; that is, &s;hould it at times appear to abate much of its violence, and then come on again&mdash;or &s;hould &s;weats too much exhau&s;t the patient, Peruvian bark, admini&s;tered with cordials, is highly proper, in &s;uch forms as the &s;tomach will be&s;t bear, either infu&s;ed in wine, in decoction, or infu&s;ed only in hot or cold water, (No. 39 to 49.)&mdash;though the fir&s;t form is e&s;teemed the be&s;t, &s;ometimes it is more agreeable to the &s;tomach in &s;ome other mode.</P>
<P>In the declen&s;ion of this fever, where the remi&s;&s;ion or in|termi&s;&s;ion was very di&s;tinct, Huxham gave the bark con|junctively with the &s;aline draught, and found it more efficaci|ous.</P>
<P>Bark al&s;o tends to prevent or check mortifications, which &s;ometimes come on from pre&s;&s;ure by long lying, bli&s;ters, or &s;i|napi&s;ms.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es of tremblings, twitching of the tendons, and convul|&s;ions, mu&s;k, in do&s;es, according to the violence of the &s;ymptoms, and mixing it with valerian, as adding to its efficacy, (No. 31 to 35.) are beneficial.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es of loo&s;ene&s;s during the cour&s;e of the complaint, if moderate, they may not be dangerous; &s;till if profu&s;e, they

<HEAD>&sect;. 4. PUTRID, OR SANGUINEO-PUTRESCENT FE|VER.</HEAD>
<P>Which term I think applicable, becau&s;e the ma&s;s of blood appears to be materially and principally concerned in this fever&mdash;for in tho&s;e of which we have before treated, the chief di&s;|turbance has been created primarily in the va&s;cular and nervous &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked, how comes it that this fever &s;ometimes begins its attack with &s;trong &s;ymptoms of an inflammatory, at others of a nervous, fever? This variation happens mo&s;t likely in its different degrees, adequate to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">mer or loo&s;er cohe&s;ion of the particles of blood.</P>
<P>For if putrid matter was to be generated in, or ab&s;orbed into the habit, who&s;e blood was of a firm texture, and va&s;cular &s;y&s;|tem had proper ten&s;ion, it would be longer before indications of ab&s;olute putridity having taken place in that con&s;titution would pre&s;ent them&s;elves, than if the nervous &s;y&s;tem had been in a &s;tate of relaxation, and the blood thin and poor. There can be little doubt of this fact&mdash;and that this deviation is owing entire|ly to the nature of one con&s;titution being able to re&s;i&s;t the ef|fects of the putrid cau&s;e longer than the other. And, indeed, if we con&s;ider that tho&s;e whom experience has pointed out to us mo&s;t &s;ubject to this di&s;ea&s;e are, the infirm; &s;uch as labour &s;evere|ly, and live in a &s;tate of poverty; the luxurious and indolent; the pen&s;ive and melancholic; tho&s;e who &s;it up late; tho&s;e of cold phlegmatic con&s;titutions; we &s;hall need little other confirmation of our a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. Here we &s;hall enumerate the general cata|logue of &s;ymptoms, and then &s;pecify &s;uch as be&s;peak its com|mencement; in order, as early as we can, to be enabled to di&s;|tingui&s;h this fever from the two foregoing, as &s;ucce&s;s greatly de|pends upon this knowledge; they requiring e&s;&s;ential deviations in &s;ome re&s;pects in our modes of cure&mdash;for the accompli&s;hing of which much depends on the method of treatment at the on|&s;et.</P>

<P>CAUSES. Tho&s;e which are <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing</HI> are &s;aid to be, feeding too much on animal food, particularly fi&s;h&mdash;eating con|&s;tantly, as the &s;ailors do, &s;alted, and half corrupted fle&s;h, and drinking putrid water&mdash;being in habits of taking alkaline, fixed, and volatile &s;alts, and aloes&mdash;corrupted fruit&mdash;moi&s;t &s;outherly winds, attended, or rather preceded by great heat&mdash;vapor of &s;tinking waters&mdash;or from fens nearly dried&mdash;or from putrid ani|mal or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances&mdash;the &s;tagnant and foul air of ho&s;pi|tals, &s;hips, pri&s;ons, and workhou&s;es&mdash;feeding on corrupted grain&mdash;contagion&mdash;or any kind of putrid effluvia&mdash;for the&s;e di&s;po&s;e the fluids to become putre&s;cent.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e which are fixed to be the <HI>proximate or immediate cau&s;es</HI> are, a putrid di&s;&s;olution of the humours, particularly of the red particles, as we have a right to conclude from the effect of pu|trid ferments di&s;&s;olving and breaking down the texture and tenacity of &s;olid and fluid &s;ub&s;tances wherein it takes place.</P>
<P>Not only from the &s;ymptomatic appearances of this di&s;ea&s;e have we rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive of the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences in general, but we &s;hall be further confirmed, on the di&s;&s;ection of tho&s;e who die of it, which &s;hew the brain and vi&s;cera, parti|cularly,

<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. In order to di&s;tingui&s;h the putrid fever in its earlie&s;t attack, or very &s;oon after, we mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, that the degrees of <HI>debility, oppre&s;&s;ion, and nau&s;ea are more con&s;iderable</HI> than in any other fever: the <HI>po&s;tration of &s;trength &s;udden and violent</HI> has for its a&s;&s;ociates <HI>extreme de&s;pondency,</HI> or <HI>in|&s;en&s;ibility,</HI> and <HI>want of apprehen&s;ion</HI> to an uncommon degree, which be&s;peaks great danger.</P>
<P>The <HI>lo&s;s of appetite,</HI> or <HI>loathing of food, &s;ickne&s;s, languor,</HI> and <HI>dull pain, of the head,</HI> &s;imilar to what happens in the two former fevers before de&s;cribed, which attend, when it comes on, as it &s;ometimes does gradually, <HI>are in the beginning always more &s;e|vere and &s;udden than in the inflammatory, though &s;eldom &s;o much &s;o as in the nervous fever.</HI> Be&s;ides, the &s;mallne&s;s of the pul&s;e, the dejection of &s;pirits, the broken texture of the blood, the pur|ple &s;pots, and putrid &s;tate of the excrements, di&s;tingui&s;h it <HI>from the inflammatory fever.</HI> The degree of heat, the very high-co|loured urine, the thir&s;t, the &s;pots, and putre&s;cency, <HI>from the ner|vous fever:</HI> And its formation is rendered perceptible by cold|ne&s;s and &s;hivering, which has for its a&s;&s;ociates nau&s;ea, vomiting, giddine&s;s, confu&s;ion of the head, extreme and &s;udden pro&s;tration of &s;trength.</P>
<P>CURE; The indications of which are, to endeavour to &s;up|port the &s;trength, counteract the putre&s;cent acrimony, and regu|late the action of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, by giving &s;trength and ac|tivity to the debilitated fibres, correcting the putrid &s;tate of the fluids, and promoting the di&s;charge of morbid matter.</P>
<P>And under &s;ome circum&s;tances, bleeding in this fever at the beginning has been advi&s;ed, where it has attacked robu&s;t con|&s;titutions full of blood, and here, perhaps, once it may be right; but not without the &s;ymptoms run to an alarming height, would I advi&s;e the operation; and then only in order to prevent the fa|tal effects which might be induced by the violence of &s;ome of them: for, though the pul&s;e &s;hould be at fir&s;t full and &s;trong, on taking away blood it &s;oon &s;inks, and &s;ometimes &s;o much, that we labour in vain afterwards to get it rai&s;ed. Without, there|fore, we have evident &s;igns of an inflammatory &s;tate of the blood, and that the brain, lungs, or &s;ome other of the vital parts are threatened with inflammation, we &s;hould never bleed&mdash;and, un|der the above circum&s;tances, then <HI>only in the beginning</HI> &s;hould a few ounces be taken away, merely as an alleviator of a danger|ous &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>Afterwards the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages are to be cleared from their con|tents by gentle emetics, (No. 11.) giving &s;mall do&s;es of antimo|nials,
<PB N="224" REF="028021_0220_0FD671BD9F9017E8">
and the&s;e repeated every &s;econd hour, (No. 6 to 9.) For wherever the &s;ymptoms, which &s;eem to indicate the u&s;e of the lancet, are violently urgent, <HI>they alone</HI> are the &s;afe&s;t applications. But we &s;hould be careful not to occa&s;ion profu&s;e di&s;charges, which may produce too great lowne&s;s. If the antimonials cau&s;e not too or three &s;tools, a gentle aperient may be given, (No. 22 to 24&mdash;49 to 51.) or gly&s;ters, (No. 25, 26.) which may be re|peated every third day.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being premi&s;ed, our chief d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pedence is on &s;uch medicines as give &s;trength and power to the &s;y&s;tem, and &s;ome of tho&s;e called anti&s;eptics, or correctors of putre&s;cent acrimony, (Page 193, 194, 195) (No. 39 to 41, and 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to 54.) particularly tho&s;e fruits which have &s;weetne&s;s coupled with acidity. (Page 193.)&mdash;the anti&s;eptic whey, (No. 48.)&mdash;fermented, or mineral acids, (Page 194.)&mdash;camphor, (Page 149.) (No. 15. 54.)&mdash;and bark, (No. 39 to 41. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. Page 194.) particularly, which has been known to produce a &s;toni&s;hing effects in a highly-di&s;&s;olving &s;tate of the blood, where haemorrhages have from that cau&s;e been pro|duced. With the&s;e medicines we &s;hould begin, as &s;oon as ever we perceive the di&s;&s;olution of the blood has taken place, from the appearance of purple &s;pots or haemorrhages; not waiting as in other malignant fevers, for any remi&s;&s;ion; for it is on bark, camphor, and wine we mu&s;t chiefly depend for &s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e ca&s;es, coupled in &s;ome of haemorrhages with a&s;tringents; to which we &s;hall &s;oon advert.</P>
<P>I would not advi&s;e, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the ca&s;es of nervous fever, the u&s;e of &s;timulants in conjunction with bark, (No. 40, 41.) but where the nervous &s;y&s;tem appears to be extremely torpid; then, I think they give great power to that, and render it more active; for I am fully per&s;uaded, that it produces its good effects, by giving firmne&s;s to the &s;olids, equability of action to the moving pow|ers, preventing the effects of putrid di&s;&s;olution, and enabling them to &s;eparate and throw off the morbid materials, rather than correcting the acrimony, or pre&s;erving the texture of the blood by any other means. And this &s;eems in a great degree to be corroborated by the opinion of HUXHAM, when &s;peaking of the&s;e fevers, who&s;e practice in the&s;e complaints was very con&s;iderable, &s;ays, <Q>Though nature very frequently affects to di&s;charge the morbific matter in putrid malignant fevers by vomits and &s;tools, yet her more con&s;tant efforts are through the pores of the &s;kin;&mdash;and I &s;olemly a&s;&s;ert, I never &s;aw the&s;e fevers com|pletely carried off till more or le&s;s of a &s;weat en&s;ued; if it proves moderately warm, and equally diffu&s;ed over the whole body; if it comes on about the &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, and the pul&s;e grows open, &s;oft and calm a little before, and during its

continuance; but if very profu&s;e, cold, clammy, or partial about the head or brea&s;t only, we have much more rea&s;on to fear than to hope from it. If profu&s;e &s;weats break out in the beginning, they are generally pernicious, &s;hould a fever &s;uper|vene.</Q></P>
<P>Under the circum&s;tances recited above, though bli&s;ters are &s;aid not to be u&s;eful in the beginning, becau&s;e the nervous &s;y&s;|tem &s;hews no &s;igns of torpor; yet are they often &s;ucceeded with happy effects, when people become &s;tupid, drow&s;y, and in&s;en&s;i|ble; and, indeed, at any time, if the pul&s;e is very low, the u|rine and excrement pa&s;s off involuntarily, which I have ob&s;erved in an early &s;tage.</P>
<P>Wine, as it is an univer&s;al cordial, &s;o it is the be&s;t, which may be given liberally; among&s;t the mo&s;t eligible of which are cla|ret, red port, and old rh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ni&s;h; or, where they cannot be had, from their dearne&s;s, ale or porter may be u&s;ed. As for <HI>food,</HI> gruel, panada, &s;harpened with orange or lemon juice, roa&s;ted ap|ples, fruit of all kinds&mdash;for <HI>drink,</HI> the wines above mentioned mixed with water, lemonade, orangeade, wine wheys of differ|ent &s;orts, apple water mixed with wine, vinegar whey, old &s;ound cyder, and all tho&s;e liquids of an ace&s;cent nature, or which cor|rect putre&s;cency, &s;hould be indulged in.</P>
<P>The room in which the &s;ick is confined &s;hould be well ven|tilated, vinegar &s;prinkled on the beds, and round the room, fre&s;h flowers and aromatic herbs &s;trewed about; the patient &s;hould have clean linen often renewed, and the &s;tools be removed as early as po&s;&s;ible, whether they pa&s;s voluntarily or otherwi&s;e; for nothing refre&s;hes the &s;ick more than cool air and cleanli|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>By the means here generally de&s;cribed we &s;hall commonly &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t and invigorate the con&s;titution, as to enable it to throw off the more morbid matter, which is done by various ways, but mo&s;t frequently by &s;weat, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in which operation, CAMPHO|RATED VINEGAR is &s;trongly recommended, (No. 55.) but, if joined with an opiate, HUXHAM &s;ays, it is the mo&s;t certain &s;udo|rific in nature&mdash;the &s;olution though, by it&s;elf, promotes per&s;pira|tion and gentle &s;weat more certainly than any other medicine; be&s;ides where mild &s;timulants are nece&s;&s;ary, it heats le&s;s than volatiles, or ardent &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Nature &s;ometimes contrives the mode of expul&s;ion for the mor|bid matter by the bowels, hence a diarrhoea, which, if attended with breathing &s;weats, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> warm moi&s;ture upon the &s;kin, is al|ways &s;erviceable, and we may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">atter our&s;elves that this is a &s;uc|ce&s;sful effort.</P>
<P>At others, &s;he relieves the habit by ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, formation of

matter in different glands, (Page 25.) &s;uch as tho&s;e under the ear, the arm-pits, or groin; or, by throwing down highly acrimoni|ous and corro&s;ive humours into the legs, about the hips, or mo&s;t|ly the lower part of the back, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this effort by continu|ally lying&mdash;hence is mortification of the integuments induced, forming thick &s;loughs, which have deep, &s;preading ulcers, from a &s;upply of a corro&s;ive fluid called ichor. Here we mu&s;t rely chiefly on Peruvian bark, to produce, by its invigorating power, a &s;eparation of the parts mortified.</P>
<P>But &s;ometimes, whil&s;t we are exerting our&s;elves to promote every good purpo&s;e, by a plan judiciou&s;ly conceived, and well &s;elected applications, &s;ome accidental occurrences will ari&s;e in different parts, which, if neglected, or judiciou&s;ly managed, will fru&s;trate our intent, and every effort of nature. Whatever, therefore, threatens to fink the patient, or di&s;turb nature's general operations, mu&s;t be, if po&s;&s;ible, checked, or totally &s;ub|dued.</P>
<P>Should a <HI>haemorrhage,</HI> as &s;ometimes happens, come on, vitri|olic acid may be added to the bark decoction. (No. 53.) or it may be given with any other vehicle, or the common drink may be acidulated with it, and given pretty freely. Should not the&s;e &s;ucceed, alum, or alum-whey may be added, (Page 189.) or given in powder. (No. 56.)</P>
<P>Should a <HI>profu&s;e diarrhoea</HI> make its appearance, and give us leave to &s;uppo&s;e that the con&s;titution by this means would be enfeebled, it mu&s;t be re&s;trained only gradually; for if we look up the matter &s;uddenly, without &s;upplying &s;ome other more gen|tle mode of pa&s;&s;age out of the machine for the corruped fluid, internal mi&s;chief might be occa&s;ioned in the inte&s;tines, by the irritation it would there produce.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t therefore endeavour to determine the fluids to the &s;kin, by &s;ome well-adapted diaphoretics, (No. 57, 58.) and, at the &s;ame time, &s;hould the &s;tools continue copious, and extremely foe|tid, gly&s;ters of fixable air, with which &s;ome mild watery antipu|tre&s;cent liquid is impregnated, or fixable air may be thrown up alone, for this is a powerful corrector of putre&s;cent acrimony, and would take off the &s;timulus of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els which pour out their contents into the bowels, called exhalent, and render the medicines given more effectual in pu&s;hing forwards, or &s;olicit|ing the humours to the &s;kin.</P>
<P>Sometimes there will occur <HI>violent vomiting,</HI> which in this fe|ver is not unu&s;ual.</P>
<P>This ought to be re&s;trained, and generally our &s;ucce&s;s in the attempt will be pretty certain, by giving the &s;aline draught in a &s;tate of fermentation. (No. 59.)</P>

By the means of this the offen&s;ive and foul matters in the &s;to|mach, and flexure of the duodenum, (42.) are &s;uppo&s;ed to be cor|rected, and thus, by removing part of the fomes, (that is, mat|ter which created the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations of the &s;tomach, and was a means of &s;upporting the febrile affections) of con&s;equence le&s;&s;en the nau&s;ea, and other &s;ymptoms indicative of its pre&s;ence, as well as, in all probability, &s;horten the duration of the fever.</P>

<P><HI>Eruptions of different colours,</HI> red, purple, black, dun, or green|in&s;h, called petechiae, &s;trike out &s;ometimes toward the clo&s;e, or earlier, of different &s;izes; but the&s;e &s;eldom bring any relief from oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;ickne&s;s, or other di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms&mdash;the redder they are the better&mdash;and it is a favourable &s;ign where tho&s;e which are of a black or violet colour become of a brighter co|lour; for the&s;e coloured &s;pots be&s;peak a high degree of putre|&s;cent acrimony, and activity, bringing on a dangerous &s;tate of &s;anguinary di&s;&s;olution&mdash;&s;o the change of colour to that which is mo&s;t favourable, &s;hews the degree of mi&s;chief le&s;&s;ening, and their cau&s;es growing weaker.</P>
<P>About the eleventh or fourteenth day, <HI>miliary eruptions</HI> with a white appearance break forth; &s;ometimes &s;ucceeding profu&s;e &s;weats, which not unfreque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tly happen at this time. The&s;e &s;eldom relieve; but if there appears a red, &s;marting, itching ra&s;h, or large, fretting watery bladders, they are &s;erviceable. But we may have hopes of recovery from the breaking out of a &s;cabby eruption about the no&s;e, lips, and corners of the mouth&mdash;the more angry and hot it is, the more favourable the omen. To the&s;e we may add, if the &s;ymptoms are mild&mdash;if a loo&s;ene&s;s or foetid &s;weat &s;hould break out at the decline of the di&s;ea&s;e, there is con&s;iderably le&s;s danger, than where there is no thir&s;t&mdash;the &s;auces inflamed&mdash;a large crop of black eruptions, which &s;udden|ly recede&mdash;a laborious re&s;piration after their eruption&mdash;a &s;well|ing of the belly with loo&s;ene&s;s&mdash;foetid and ichorous &s;tools&mdash;cold|ne&s;s

of the extremities&mdash;and convul&s;ions&mdash;for the&s;e afford mo&s;t calamitous portents.</P>
<P>Indeed, with regard to the aphthae or thru&s;h, of whatever co|lour, they carry along with them no plea&s;ing omen, when they break out on the in&s;ide of the mouth&mdash;for they are &s;oon &s;ucceed|ed by putrid ulcerations of the throat, &amp;c. bringing along with them difficulty of &s;wallowing, and hiccough, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance&mdash;afterwards, foetid, bloody, and dy&s;enteric evacuations, proba|bly from ulceration and mortification of the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>But when patients have fortunately pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tage of fatality, they often become drop&s;ical, or have watery &s;wellings in their legs, we mu&s;t not, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, depend on purga|tives to evacuate the watery-fluid, as in other drop&s;ies&mdash;but bark, (Page 194.) &s;teel, and the natural chalybeate waters. (Page 139.) to &s;trengthen and invigorate the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, and promote ab&s;orption. (No. 61, 62.)</P>
<P>But, in order to prevent a relap&s;e when the cri&s;is is perfected, from putre&s;cent or offen&s;ive matters accumulating in the fir&s;t pa&s;|&s;ages, a gentle purgative of two, (No; 3. 19, 20, 21.) is ab&s;olute|ly requi&s;ite&mdash;and a cour&s;e of aromatic bitters, joined with chaly|beates. (No. 63, 64, 65.) or &s;ome of the chalybeate waters, (Page 139.) with light, nutritious, ea&s;ily dige&s;tible food. (Page 209.)</P>
<P>And here we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that where we find any prevailing acid upon the &s;tomach, we would advi&s;e &s;teel to be given in &s;ub|&s;tance&mdash;where not, &s;ome of the chalybeate &s;alts, of which the tartarized iron, (Page 139.) is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to be the be&s;t, and may be given in&s;tead of vitriolated iron&mdash;and it is &s;aid to have proved efficacious where all the others have failed; and it more &s;oluble in the animal fluids.</P>
<P>The medicines above pre&s;cribed, or &s;ome others of the &s;ame kind, are thought nece&s;&s;ary, in order to recover the tone of the vi&s;cera, and enable the dige&s;tive powers to a&s;&s;ume their wonted power&mdash;which being neglected, a foundation may be laid for chro|nic complaints, by the con&s;titution's being loaded with acrimo|nious and ill-conditioned humours, and &s;ubjecting the patient to jaundice, drop&s;ies, con&s;umptions, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;imilar mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>We have now fini&s;hed our account of &s;imple fevers: and as we con&s;ider all the others, whatever their appellation, to belong to one of the foregoing, &s;imply, or conjointly, we &s;hall be under the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to &s;ome of the modes of cure, here &s;pecified, in all; and have therefore cho&s;en here to add the forms of medicines made u&s;e of in the&s;e fevers, referring in the body of the work occa&s;ionally to the more general catalogue, that

<HEAD>&sect; 5. MIXED FEVERS.</HEAD>
<P>On treating on the different kinds of &s;imple fevers, in the four former &s;ections, we found, that according to their differences, we could di&s;cover which part of the &s;y&s;tem was in them particu|larly affected, and con&s;tituted the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="028021_0237_0FD6721419DB6E38">
In the <HI>&s;imple continued,</HI> the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, with re&s;pect only to its motions being quickened.</P>
<P>In <HI>the inflammatory,</HI> be&s;ides the increa&s;e of motion, we per|ceive tenacity in the blood, and the &s;trength and activity of the ve&s;&s;els augmented beyond what is natural.</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;low nervous,</HI> the nerves &s;eem to be primarily and chief|ly affected, without any increa&s;e of va&s;cular action, but rather a degree of torpor, and defect in their natural motion, with a lentor, or vi&s;cidity of the &s;erum, lymph, and thin humours.</P>
<P>In the <HI>putrid,</HI> this nervous affection was accompanied at fir&s;t, or &s;oon after, with a putre&s;cency of the fluids.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e peculiarities produce particular &s;ymptoms, which enable us to di&s;cover their nature. But the cla&s;s of fevers rank|ed under this head have &s;ome of the immediate cau&s;es of the&s;e &s;imple fevers &s;o blended together, as the <HI>inflammatory and malig|nant,</HI> the <HI>malignant and nervous,</HI> the <HI>nervous and inflammatory</HI>&mdash;or &s;o in&s;tantaneou&s;ly and imperceptibly follow each other, ac|cording to the indications to be deduced from the &s;ymptoms, that we are at a lo&s;s where to refer them&mdash;as the di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;igns of the two different kinds will pre&s;ent them&s;elves at the &s;ame time; for in &s;ome we find great nau&s;ea and extreme debi|lity&mdash;great heat, with a quick, &s;trong, and hard pul&s;e&mdash;here are the characteri&s;tic &s;ymptoms of the inflammatory and putrid unit|ed, and form truly the MIXED FEVER. We will, however, now endeavour to explain how the&s;e ari&s;e.</P>
<P>When &s;peaking of the brain, (Page 26, 27.) it was there &s;aid, that va&s;cular irritability might be independent of nervous influ|ence, though, for the continuance of that irritability, nervous influence is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. We mu&s;t now farther ob&s;erve, that va&s;cular irritation always requires local &s;timulus for its &s;up|port, and that the ve&s;&s;els may be affected without any &s;trong in|di&s;po&s;ition of the nerves&mdash;and &s;o on the contrary&mdash;and al&s;o that they may be conjointly affected from the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e farther affirm, that morbid particles creating di&s;|ea&s;e produce different effects, from their elective power upon the &s;olids as well as fluids&mdash;hence from this &s;ource ari&s;es the dif|ferent natures of &s;pecific fevers&mdash;and hence it is from the differ|ent combinations of the cau&s;es that the mixed fevers deduce their origin.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be an extremely difficult ta&s;k to draw our ideas of the&s;e fevers into a &s;mall compa&s;s; or &s;o to &s;implify them, that all which occur can be brought within the bounds of a conci&s;e defi|nition; for every cau&s;e which can produce any of the forego|ing febrile complaints; every part which can al&s;o be affected in them, may conjunctively appear &s;o in the&s;e; and in &s;uch very
<PB N="242" REF="028021_0238_0FD671D128CD5000">
different degrees, that we are puzzled to di&s;criminate to which they can properly belong.</P>
<P>I can by no means agree with the idea of Dr. CULLEN, that the account he has given of the fever he terms SYNOCHUS, which obviou&s;ly is his mixed fever, is at all adequate to comprehend the whole of tho&s;e fevers, which come certainly under this term&mdash;for he &s;ays, <Q>it is a contagious fever for the mo&s;t part, com|po&s;ed of the inflammatory fever at the beginning, in its pro|gre&s;s, and towards its termination, running into a nervous or putrid fever,</Q>&mdash;which he names typhus&mdash;In all which there is no practical utility; for it may be only an inflammatory fe|ver &s;imply, thus terminating; which often happens to be the ca&s;e&mdash;induced frequently by the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ome ac|cidental circum&s;tances, or mi&s;management. The continued, or va&s;culo-plethoric fever, which is &s;imple, may, from the &s;ame cau&s;es, have the &s;ame termination.</P>
<P>Though we will not &s;ay that fevers of the above de&s;cription may not &s;ometimes occur &s;till we think that the complicated affections may always be in a great degree ob&s;erved, and &s;hould be particularly pointed out.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced on this &s;ubject, the great diffi|culty of forming a definition to comprehend the whole of the&s;e fevers which may often meet our ob&s;ervation, is &s;ufficiently ob|vious.</P>
<P>However, in defining the&s;e fevers in general, I &s;hould &s;ay, that the ANOMALOUS, OR MIXED FEVERS, were an affection of the nervous and va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, and &s;ome|times conjoined with that of the ma&s;s of circulating fluids, pro|ducing febrile appearances; but, from the beginning, very often &s;o indi&s;tinctly marked, having the inflammatory, nervous, and putrid &s;ymptoms &s;o blended, that it is difficult to &s;ay to what kind they mo&s;t peculiarly belong; and if we add to this Dr. CULLEN'S opinion, (Page 241.) the idea of mixed fevers will be tolerably complete;&mdash;and as we have given the whole of the &s;ymptoms &s;eparately under each of our former divi&s;ions, by con|&s;idering &s;ome of them here in a conjunctive &s;tate; and marking tho&s;e which are mo&s;t prevalent; we &s;hall be enabled to point out what is nece&s;&s;ary to be done&mdash;to alleviate that &s;pecies which is the mo&s;t powerful in its action, con&s;equently the mo&s;t danger|ous, and not altogether neglect the other&mdash;but this to execute pro|perly requires profound medical knowledge, quick perception, nice di&s;crimination, and experienced &s;agacity.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="028021_0239_0FD672160EE3C098">
SYDENHAM, to whom I &s;hall refer my reader, has given us &s;ome hi&s;tories of the&s;e kinds of fevers, under different names, either according to SOME PREVALENT SYMPTOM&mdash;as <HI>the &s;udato|ry, or &s;weating, the comatous or drow&s;y</HI>&mdash;or to THE INTENT OF NATURE, as the <HI>depuratory, or clean&s;ing</HI>&mdash;the IMITATIVE, as the <HI>variolous fever,</HI> or <HI>that &s;imilar to the &s;mall pox fever</HI>&mdash;or to THE SEASON, as <HI>the hyemal, or wintery.</HI> We &s;hall content our&s;elves with pre&s;enting, as a &s;pecimen, The PUERPERAL, or CHILD-BED FEVER, one of the mo&s;t dangerous and fatal with which medicine is at pre&s;ent acquainted.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. This fever generally begins on the fir&s;t, &s;econd, or third day, &s;ometimes later, after delivery, with cold|ne&s;s or &s;hivering preceding any <HI>pains of the belly,</HI> which are <HI>vio|lent,</HI> and <HI>has a &s;orene&s;s attending over the whole region below the &s;tomach, &s;carce capable of hearing the gentle&s;t touch</HI>&mdash;the belly is &s;ometimes &s;oft&mdash;&s;ometimes greatly &s;welled. The pains, though general, will affect &s;ome one part more particularly than ano|ther, and &s;hoot from the loins to the groins and thighs, and &s;ome|times affect the anus and neck of the bladder.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e is quick and weak, though now and then, e&s;pecially a little after the attack, &s;trong and full&mdash;the &s;kin is, for the mo&s;t part, hot and dry, though &s;ometimes cool and temperate; and, not unfrequently, intermediate &s;weats come on all over the bo|dy, and u&s;ually afford &s;ome alleviation&mdash;there is a con&s;tant pain of the head, chiefly the forehead, and above the eyebrows, attended often with a giddine&s;s and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The tongue has very different appearances, commonly white, &s;oft, and moi&s;t, and will thus continue till near death&mdash;then it becomes dry, rough, and of a yellowi&s;h brown colour&mdash;a red line will &s;ometimes run up its middle, with a whitene&s;s on each &s;ide; the fir&s;t is dry, the la&s;t moi&s;t&mdash;along with the&s;e there is al&s;o a great thir&s;t.</P>
<P>The face is often flu&s;hed, &s;ometimes of a deep red, or livid co|lour fixed in the cheeks. There appears in the countenance and eyes &s;trong marks of anxiety and dejection of &s;pirits. <HI>From the very beginning of this di&s;temper, the patients &s;eem afraid of taking a ful in&s;piration, hence is the breathing quick and &s;hort, appear|ing not to proceed from any affection of the lungs very often; and as the di&s;ea&s;e increa&s;es, &s;o doe, the &s;hortne&s;s of breathing.</HI></P>
<P>There is mo&s;t commonly a cough as a concomitant;&mdash;load of the &s;tomach&mdash;nau&s;ea&mdash;and vomiting of yellow, greeni&s;h, or black materials, frequently attend; but not invariably, though they
<PB N="244" REF="028021_0240_0FD671D4C4DD77D8">
&s;ometimes come on from the time of delivery, nay, now and then indeed precede it;&mdash;and, at the approach of death, what is vomited up is either green or black.</P>
<P>If blood &s;hould be taken away, it is in general &s;izy, with a quantity of yellow &s;erum. The pain of the head, though very trouble&s;ome, is &s;eldom attended, till a few hours before death, with delirium.</P>
<P>The urine at fir&s;t is made with difficulty, and &s;mall in quan|tity, though removed by two or three &s;tools; and, as the di&s;ea&s;e abates, it is declared by a depo&s;ition of the colour of brick du&s;t, or whiti&s;h &s;ediment.</P>
<P>At the commencement the habit is, for the mo&s;t part, co&s;tive&mdash;&s;ometimes regular&mdash;at others loo&s;e, di&s;charging very foetid and brown coloured faeces&mdash;and in both &s;tates <HI>flatulence attends</HI>&mdash;and the general omens of approaching di&s;&s;olution are, involun|tarily evacuations from the bowels.</P>
<P>In high degrees of this di&s;ea&s;e, the patient, for the mo&s;t part, lies on her back, &s;eldom turns on either &s;ide, and never on her belly.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the general &s;ymptoms, by which the fever may be di&s;covered, and which appear when the uterus is not affected&mdash;but if we perceive any of the &s;ymptoms which are declaratory of uterine inflammation, we may &s;u&s;pect the affection of that or|gan a participating cau&s;e.</P>
<P>CAUSES. Tho&s;e which are con&s;idered <HI>as the remote or in|ducing,</HI> are,</P>
<P>Intemperance <HI>during pregnancy</HI>&mdash;too great fatigue, or total want of exerci&s;e&mdash;too high or too low living&mdash;co&s;tivene&s;s, or the rever&s;e&mdash;exce&s;s of joy or grief&mdash;moi&s;t and warm atmo&s;phere, impregnated with putrid effluvia. <HI>In lying in,</HI> an overheated air&mdash;too warm a regimen&mdash;&s;udden frights&mdash;co&s;tivene&s;s after deli|very&mdash;and every accident which can ob&s;truct per&s;piration&mdash;vio|lence, and too great ha&s;te in &s;eparating the placenta&mdash;and bind|ing up the trunk of the body with too tight bandages.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e which are &s;aid to be the <HI>proximate</HI> or <HI>immediate,</HI> are,</P>
<P>Impeded circulation, or &s;tagnation of the blood, generally in the ve&s;&s;els of the omentum, (37.) and inte&s;tines, chiefly the ex|ternal coat of the &s;mall ones, (42.) &s;ometimes of the womb, (51.) inducing in tho&s;e parts inflammation, from the debilitated &s;tate of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem there &s;ituated, brought on by the pre&s;&s;ure of the pregnant womb; if cau&s;es (243.) occur which are capa|ble of producing febrile affections in the habit&mdash;which affections are fir&s;t mo&s;t commonly of the inflammatory; afterwards, if the fever in this &s;tate is not cured, of the putre&s;cent kind.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Common febrile &s;ymptoms,
<PB N="245" REF="028021_0241_0FD67217E15785C0">
attended with violent acute pains of the belly below the &s;tomach, with &s;orene&s;s of the parts &s;o great as &s;carce to bear the gentle&s;t touch&mdash;dread in taking a full in&s;piration&mdash;breathing quick and &s;hort, nor appearing to proceed from affections of the lungs&mdash;and increa&s;ing with the di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;and in co&s;tivene&s;s, or the rever&s;e, flatulence.</P>
<P>CURE. The indications are to take off in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the inflammation, and prevent the humours from running into a &s;tate of putre&s;cent acrimony&mdash;both which are effected by bleed|ing, if nece&s;&s;ary, at the on&s;et&mdash;purging&mdash;promoting the urinary di&s;charge&mdash;or &s;weating&mdash;for in &s;ome of the&s;e ways this fever ge|nerally goes off, or is conquered, particularly by purging. If the termination is favourable, it occurs in three, four, or five days; if otherwi&s;e, from the fifth to the twelfth.</P>
<P>Hence, therefore, from what has been above delivered, our medical conduct is plainly pointed out.</P>
<P>If, at an early period of the di&s;ea&s;e, the habit is found abound|ing with blood, the febrile heat great, and the pul&s;e full and &s;trong, blood mu&s;t be immediately drawn from the arm; and, &s;hould the body be co&s;tive, an emollient aperient gly&s;ter, (No. 25, 26.) &s;hould be, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, admini&s;tered; but &s;hould not this relieve by producing evacuation, &s;ome mild or emollient aperient medicine (Page 171, 172.) mu&s;t be given, till a free di&s;|charge from the bowels is procured&mdash;for &s;tools mu&s;t at all events be had; on the&s;e, at fir&s;t, are founded our greate&s;t hopes of &s;uc|ce&s;s; as by emptying the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, all di&s;ten&s;ion from the contained faeces is taken off&mdash;flatulence le&s;&s;ened&mdash;irritation from the faeces avoided&mdash;and &s;ome degree of freedom given to the cir|culating powers of the parts affected.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IX. CHAP. I. REMITTENT FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>FEVERS of this kind receive their name from the mode which they pre&s;erve through their progre&s;s, &s;teering betwixt tho&s;e of the continued and the intermittent cla&s;s; for though the fe|ver does not pre&s;erve throughout an equal degree of violence as in the former, there is never a total ce&s;&s;ation of febrile affection before its termination, as in the latter. The&s;e fevers, therefore move betwixt the two extremes; having, in&s;tead of fre&s;h acce&s;|&s;ions, as they are called in intermittents, only repeated increa&s;e of action, denominated exacerbations; between which a degree of va&s;cular contraction and pro&s;tration of &s;trength are continued, indicative of the pre&s;ence of the febrile cau&s;e &s;till in action; and from hence they take their name.</P>
<P>But, indeed, the remi&s;&s;ions are &s;ometimes &s;o &s;light, that they are with difficulty di&s;tingui&s;hed by the clo&s;e&s;t attention from con|tinued fevers&mdash;though this di&s;crimination is highly nece&s;&s;ary, as they yield more in their mode of cure to that we &s;hall find em|ployed in intermittents, being &s;ubdued with more certainty by the bark, <HI>judiciou&s;ly admini&s;tered,</HI> than by any other application. Indeed, they &s;eem to have &s;o great affinity with the continued and intermittent fever, that they &s;ometimes run into one, &s;ome|times into the other&mdash;and the continued, before it becomes in|termittent perfectly, will a&s;&s;ume the remittent type, &s;o will the intermittent before it changes into a continued.</P>
<P>From &s;ome appearances occurring in the cour&s;e of the&s;e fe|vers, they have been divided into <HI>quotidian&mdash;tertian</HI>&mdash;or <HI>quarta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>&mdash;according as the remi&s;&s;ion has happened on the &s;econd, third, or fourth day; but in this divi&s;ion there appears to be no prac|tical utility&mdash;as it leads not to any particular mode of cure, nor a&s;&s;i&s;ts in di&s;tingui&s;hing the nature of them, whether they verge mo&s;t to the inflammatory cla&s;s, which knowledge alone mu&s;t de|termine our operations.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. They, like other fevers, generally begin with alternate chills and heat, &s;tretching and yawning; and the&s;e are &s;ucceeded by nau&s;ea, vomiting of bile, giddine&s;s, and op|pre&s;&s;ion&mdash;then commences the fever, and the heat continues; af|ter the&s;e follow pain of the head, back, and limbs&mdash;heart-burn&mdash;and 
<PB N="251" REF="028021_0247_0FD6721CCA4B25A8">
thir&s;t&mdash;difficult breathing&mdash;anxiety&mdash;inquietude&mdash;and, &s;ome|times from the fir&s;t attack, delirium&mdash;the &s;tomach &s;wells now and then&mdash;the eyes are generally tinged with a yellow colour, and that diffu&s;ed over the whole body not unfrequently&mdash;the tongue is white and moi&s;t&mdash;the pul&s;e &s;ometimes hard, &s;eldom full&mdash;the bowels are at one time ob&s;tructed, at another the re|ver&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated are &s;ome periods betwixt the &s;econd and eighth day; which time a remi&s;&s;ion very rarely exceeds; for the mo&s;t part a gentle &s;weat will come on, and brings an alleviation of all the febrile &s;ymptoms; and this continues for &s;ome hours; after which, generally in the evening, the violence of the fever is re|newed, &s;ometimes preceded by chillne&s;s, &s;ometimes not.</P>
<P>This repetition hath no fixed time for its continuance, in &s;ome remaining a longer, in others a &s;horter &s;pace; but at la&s;t gives way in its degree of violence, and remits a &s;econd time; and thus continues fluctuating till either totally &s;ubdued by nature or art&mdash;or death clo&s;es the &s;cene.</P>
<P>When this la&s;t is the ca&s;e, the patient often dies in the parox|y&s;m, or renewal of the attack&mdash;the brain is immediately affected&mdash;he lo&s;es his &s;en&s;es, and the power of &s;peech&mdash;his breathing be|comes quick&mdash;deglutition is impeded&mdash;a loo&s;ene&s;s comes on&mdash;the pul&s;e in the beginning &s;oft, not to be called weak, nor indi|cative of danger, in a few hours is &s;mall and depre&s;&s;ed, then cold &s;weats break out, and the unhappy victim expires.</P>
<P>The&s;e fevers have, by &s;ome, been &s;tiled <HI>bilious,</HI> from the vo|miting of bile, &s;o common in their commencement, and the yel|low &s;uffu&s;ion on the &s;kin and whites of the eyes; &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e &s;ymptoms to ari&s;e from the &s;uperabundance of bilious excretion, and the activity of the bile re&s;orbed into the habit, occa&s;ioning &s;uch febrile commotions&mdash;But it is obvious this change of co|lour is owing to another cau&s;e, and <HI>that,</HI> the breaking down of the texture of the blood from the putre&s;cent tendency of the fluids; and thus may the colour more properly be accounted for; be|cau&s;e the bile may be returned into the blood, as in the jaun|dice, without producing the&s;e febrile attacks.</P>
<P>In hot countries that are mar&s;hy, where the atmo&s;phere is filled from thence with putrid exhalations, they are <HI>endemial,</HI> that is, nalive and re&s;ident&mdash;with us, and other parts of Europe, they have been ob&s;erved to become <HI>epidemical,</HI> that is, occa&s;ionally ge|neral, towards the latter end of autumn.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing</HI> are &s;aid by &s;ome, as well as the <HI>proximate,</HI> to be &s;uch as bring on a continued, or inflam|matory, or a putrid fever, (209, 221.) whil&s;t others attribute <HI>the fir&s;t</HI> to too great moi&s;ture in the air, <HI>the la&s;t</HI> to in&s;en&s;ible per&s;pi|ration

impeded, and a relaxed &s;tate of fibres. However, from the hi&s;tory of the&s;e fevers, it is obvious, that they, at different pe|riods, and in different con&s;titutions, put on appearances which are very different, and according to which we are to regulate our conduct. Hence we &s;ay, the</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS are, a remi&s;&s;ion or abatement, not a total ce&s;&s;ation of febrile affections, &s;ucceeded by percepti|ble exacerbation, or increa&s;e of febrile violence; which increa&s;e is <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> u&s;hered in with chillne&s;s;&mdash;and if there are &s;trong &s;ymptoms of va&s;cular contraction, and great increa&s;e of circula|tory motion, which are declared by <HI>extreme heat&mdash;thir&s;t</HI>&mdash;and <HI>pain</HI>&mdash;having a <HI>dry &s;kin, &s;trong, hard, and full pul&s;e,</HI> for their a&s;|&s;ociates, we &s;hall not he&s;itate to pronounce it INFLAMMATORY;&mdash;but if attended with <HI>great debility&mdash;lowne&s;s of &s;pirits&mdash;nau&s;ea&mdash;oppre&s;&s;ion&mdash;vomiting</HI>&mdash;coupled with <HI>di&s;colouration of the &s;kin, and languid pul&s;e,</HI> its belonging to the putrid cla&s;s is indi&s;puta|ble.</P>
<P>This fever is never free from danger; though the nearer it ap|proaches to an intermittent, or the le&s;s degree of fever continues during the remi&s;&s;ion, &s;o much more favourable the omen; but, on the contrary, the more it puts on the appearance of a conti|nued fever, the &s;horter the remi&s;&s;ion, and more violent the fever fit, &s;o much the more dangerous. If the urine, which was be|fore of a deep colour, becomes pale, we have great rea&s;on for fear&mdash;If it changes its remittent for a continued type, the event is doubtful&mdash;and when the brain is affected, and the re&s;t of the &s;ymptoms, as de&s;cribed (Page 251. line 19, &amp;c.) death is near at hand.</P>
<P>CURE. The indications are &s;imilar to what we have deliver|ed on the inflammatory (209) and putrid (221) fevers, adapted to peculiar &s;tates agreeing with them, by which this fever may be changed into an intermittent, or totally taken off&mdash;con&s;equently, where the inflammatory &s;ymptoms are prevalent, bleeding, cool|ing purges and gly&s;ters&mdash;vomits&mdash;and &s;mall do&s;es of antimonials&mdash;watery diluting liquids drank plentifully&mdash;cooling ace&s;cent ve|getables&mdash;will be the mo&s;t eligible at the commencement, and will &s;o far an&s;wer the purpo&s;e in &s;ome ca&s;es, that nature after|wards may be almo&s;t left to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Still, in others, &s;he requires the mo&s;t immediate and powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;hence it is nece&s;&s;ary to point out the different pro|gre&s;&s;ive appearances, by which may be di&s;covered the &s;ituation of &s;afety, or danger, and the mode of proper management under each, as, from imprudent conduct, this fever, from its milde&s;t &s;tate may be converted into that of extreme peril, and from this la&s;t into certain death.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="028021_0249_0FD6721E41DA9C00">
If, therefore, the increa&s;e of the febrile affections, a third time, &s;hould not be more violent, nor of longer continuance than that which preceded, but nearly &s;imilar. If the urine &s;hould let fall a laudable &s;ediment, without any vi&s;ible decrea&s;e of &s;trength, or increa&s;ed dejection of &s;pirits, matters will wear a favourable a&s;|pect: and about the fourth or fifth return of the fever, the pow|ers of the con&s;titution will commonly relieve them&s;elves by &s;ome critical evacuation, either by the KIDNEYS, SKIN, INTESTINES, SALIVARY SYSTEM, or LUNGS, manife&s;ted in <HI>turpid urine, pro|fu&s;e &s;weat, bilious &s;tools, copious &s;pitting,</HI> or <HI>expectoration of matter of a yellow ca&s;t</HI>&mdash;for the fever generally re&s;olves it&s;elf in one or more of the&s;e ways.</P>
<P>But, on the fifth return, &s;hould there appear to be an increa&s;e in degrees of &s;everity, in the &s;ymptoms becoming more acute and dangerous&mdash;if the &s;it continues longer, and is more violent than before, and there are obviou&s;ly a &s;inking and lowne&s;s of &s;pi|rits, with great debility of the powers of the &s;y&s;tem, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to bli&s;ters, which &s;ome indeed advi&s;e at an earlier period, as calculated in a remarkable manner to bring on the in|termittent type&mdash;and bark as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible in the remi&s;&s;ion; forty or &s;ixty grains of the powder may be admini&s;tered every &s;econd or third hour&mdash;or, if the &s;tomach will not bear this quan|tity, a &s;maller do&s;e be given at &s;horter periods, or the decoction, (193.) hot or cold infu&s;ion, (No. 41.) with or without the vola|tiles or aromatics, as &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary; to which al&s;o may be oc|ca&s;ionally added, the other preparations of this medicine, (193, 194.) by the&s;e means many endeavour to &s;top, or at lea&s;t retard the progre&s;s of the next febrile fit, by throwing into the habit a &s;ufficient quantity&mdash;and thus mu&s;t we proceed till we &s;hall be em|powered within twelve or fourteen hours to admini&s;ter &s;ix or eight drams.</P>
<P>If we are not active at this period, and attempt not with all our power to mitigate or conquer the febrile affections, we run the ri&s;que of protracting the di&s;ea&s;e, and rendering it more re|plete with danger; for now the fits become &s;o quick, and fol|lowing each other &s;o rapidly, that we are deprived of the oppor|tunity of throwing in the bark in proper quantity, and permit|ting a continued fever to be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>But though bark in &s;ome &s;tates of this fever is &s;o extremely u&s;eful, &s;till, in every &s;tage it is not nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;nay, indeed, in the inflammatory remittents (251.) it is dangerous to admini&s;ter it, whil&s;t the action of the ve&s;&s;els are too powerful; for from this we might produce the inflammatory continued fever; therefore we mu&s;t endeavour to lower the &s;y&s;tem, by tho&s;e means advi&s;ed,
<PB N="254" REF="028021_0250_0FD67261EA13B2B0">
(252, line 33.)&mdash;that done, the bark may then be advantageou&s;ly thrown in.</P>
<P>Before we clo&s;e the account of this fever, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that though bleeding, and that repeatedly, has been advi&s;ed in &s;ome of the&s;e fevers, and with con&s;iderable advantage; yet un|der &s;ome circum&s;tances there requires the nice&s;t caution, with re&s;pect to the quantity to be taken away, notwith&s;tanding the commencement being u&s;hered in with &s;uch &s;ymptoms, as might authori&s;e the operation; for bleeding has been allowed to do mi&s;chief, e&s;pecially in hot countries, for there the&s;e fevers are generally of the putrid kind&mdash;therefore in our fir&s;t bleedings the quantity &s;hould be moderate, &s;eldom exceeding eight ounces&mdash;which may be repeated in ca&s;e the inflammatory &s;ymptoms con|tinue violent&mdash;but &s;hould the&s;e only be &s;light at fir&s;t, and evacu|ations are nece&s;&s;ary to be promoted, we can only depend upon the gentle&s;t cathartics, &s;uch as oil of ca&s;tor, manna, tartarized kali, Polychre&s;t &s;alt, and tartarized antimony&mdash;(See Cathartics, Simple continued, and Inflammatory fevers, where different for|mulae will be found) and al&s;o the &s;aline mixture&mdash;which la&s;t of|ten repeated, is &s;aid to be the mo&s;t certain alleviator of the vio|lent nau&s;ea and vomiting, which generally attend the&s;e ca&s;es&mdash;or it may be given in its &s;tate of fermentation, (No. 59.) and is greatly a&s;&s;i&s;tant in correcting the putrid di&s;po&s;ition, and tho&s;e foulne&s;&s;es which are collected in the &s;tomach and flexure of the duodenum&mdash;(42.) afterwards the bark mu&s;t be freely applied. By the&s;e means thou&s;ands have been &s;aved; and if they are be|gun with before the &s;trength of the patient is exhau&s;ted, and will properly pur&s;ue the advice given, &s;eldom any die of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>However in the We&s;t Indies in this fever there is &s;omething very &s;ingular, for it has been ob&s;erved, that if the bark was not given on the fir&s;t remi&s;&s;ion, it was apt to run into the continued &s;pecies.</P>
<P>There are innumerable varieties of the&s;e fevers mentioned by authors, who have given them different names, according to &s;ome peculiar circum&s;tances which attended&mdash;but all yield to the mode of treatment here pointed out&mdash;only in &s;ome paying particular attention to any uncommon &s;ymptom which occurred&mdash;two of which we &s;hall point out.</P>

<HEAD>BILIOUS REMITTENT FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>This attacks generally in the middle of Augu&s;t, and is attend|ed, be&s;ides the common &s;ymptoms, with violent pain of the head, and often with delirium, which &s;ymptoms continue in the night, vani&s;h in the day-time, after &s;weating, a haemorrhage or loo&s;e|ne&s;s.

In the beginning there is frequent nau&s;ea, bilious putrid vomiting, and in the end oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In extreme cold weather, and at the approach of winter, a cough, rheumatic affections, and tenacity of the blood, accom|panies the&s;e fevers&mdash;but it is from the bilious purging and vo|miting that it derives its name. If evacuations are not directed, a continued fever with yellowne&s;s comes on. The cure is per|formed by vomits cathartics, acids, and bark; but we mu&s;t fir&s;t per&s;i&s;t in the u&s;e of evacuants before we give the bark, and then it is admirably conducive to promote the cure.

<P>This fever not only happens in moi&s;t, but al&s;o in warm coun|tries, according to the &s;ea&s;on, as they come on in the months of July and Augu&s;t, from putrid vapours ari&s;ing from corrupted plants or fi&s;h.</P>
<P>This bears bleeding very indifferently, and &s;hould rather be treated in the evacuating and &s;trengthening method; at the be|ginning clearing the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages with gentle emetics and cathar|tics, and continuing &s;mall do&s;es of antimonials&mdash;which not &s;uc|ceeding to our wi&s;h; bark mu&s;t be called in to our aid to per|form the cure.</P>
<P>In order to prevent the attacks of the remittent fevers, as they are chiefly the children of moi&s;t &s;ea&s;ons, and low mar&s;hy coun|tries, we &s;hould keep good fires, with intent to correct the atmo&s;|pheric humidity&mdash;make u&s;e of aromatics&mdash;avoid the evening and morning air&mdash;drink red wine&mdash;u&s;e exerci&s;e and the cold bath&mdash;take bark once or twice a day, mixed with bitters&mdash;and &s;moak tobacco&mdash;for people who have ob&s;erved the&s;e rules have, many of them, e&s;caped in countries where this fever has raged epide|mically, and afflicted numbers who have de&s;pi&s;ed the&s;e cautions.</P>

<P>THESE fevers receive their name from the nature of their pro|gre&s;s, having a perfect ce&s;&s;ation of febrile affections from

the termination of one fit to the beginning of another, and may be con&s;idered as continued fevers of &s;hort duration, con&s;i&s;t|ing of many febrile fits, the fever returning at &s;tated periods; for in every fit the cour&s;e of a continued fever is run through&mdash;the coldne&s;s and &s;hivering is the beginning&mdash;the hot &s;it the height&mdash;and the &s;weating generally attendant, or at lea&s;t a gentle per|&s;piration the cri&s;is or termination. What happens in the&s;e dif|ferent &s;tages is thus properly de&s;cribed:</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. IN THE FIRST STAGE it begins with yawning and &s;tretching, and a certain inde&s;cribable &s;en&s;ation in the back and the ends of the fingers; after the&s;e &s;ucceed exce&s;|&s;ive coldne&s;s, in&s;omuch, that it occa&s;ions violent &s;haking of the whole body, and chattering of the teeth; &s;till, in fact, the blood is in a &s;tate of increa&s;ed, rather than dimini&s;hed heat&mdash;there are al&s;o nau&s;ea, and &s;ometimes vomiting attendant, with pains of the back, head, and limbs&mdash;the ends of the no&s;e, ears, lips, and cheeks grow pale&mdash;the nails livid&mdash;the breathing is difficult&mdash;the urine pale and limpid&mdash;the pul&s;e weak, and extremely quick&mdash;and this cold fit continues for one, two, three, four, or five hours &s;ome|times, at others only half an hour before the hot fit commences&mdash;which forms the</P>
<P>SECOND STAGE, in which there is extreme degree of heat im|mediately &s;ucceeding the cold, which goes off gradually: in this the pul&s;e becomes full, quick, and &s;trong&mdash;the head is painful&mdash;and &s;ometimes the patients are delirious&mdash;their breathing is for|cible and free&mdash;the tongue white, attended with great thir&s;t&mdash;at the pit of the &s;tomach they complain of much heat, have pain there, and &s;ometimes &s;welling&mdash;the urine is high coloured&mdash;and when blood is taken from the arm it is more den&s;e than u&s;ual, particularly in &s;pring&mdash;&s;ometimes in unwhole&s;ome &s;ituations and &s;ea&s;ons the &s;uperior part is red, the inferior black, with a &s;mall portion of &s;erum, and that le&s;s cohe&s;ive than when in health. At the commencement of the</P>
<P>THIRD STAGE there breaks out a general and copious &s;weat, which alleviates the extreme heat, and mitigates all the &s;ymp|toms, which, on the &s;weat continuing for &s;ome hours, totally va|ni&s;hes&mdash;the urine depo&s;its a &s;ediment like brick-du&s;t&mdash;the patient falls into a &s;ound &s;leep&mdash;and thus the fit clo&s;es with a ce&s;&s;ation of all the febrile &s;ymptoms; and this, called the intermi&s;&s;ion, in which the patient feels &s;ome degree of debility, has much pro|pen&s;ity to &s;weat, and little or no appetite.</P>
<P>It has been thought that we could progno&s;ticate the violence of the hot, by the degrees of the duration of the cold fit, for the longer the latter continued, the more &s;evere would be the for|mer&mdash;
<PB N="257" REF="028021_0253_0FD67225CB283F38">
&mdash;but this is erroneous, for the &s;en&s;ation of cold grows weak|er in long continued intermittents.</P>
<P>In &s;ome countries the&s;e fevers are peculiar, as the fens of Cam|bridge&s;hire, Lincoln&s;hire, the low parts of Kent, the mar&s;hes of E&s;&s;ex, and in places where there is much moi&s;ture, and the &s;itu|ation low; and here they generally appear in &s;pring or autumn. They &s;eldom vi&s;it other places, except in &s;ea&s;ons adapted to their propagation, and then they become epidemic.</P>
<P>They have been divided into vernal and autumnal, endemical and epidemical, and into <HI>quotidian,</HI> where from the termination of one fit to the beginning of another the &s;pace of 24 hours is con&s;umed&mdash;<HI>tertian,</HI> where that of 48&mdash;<HI>quartan,</HI> where of 72&mdash;and when longer, erratic. They have al&s;o been divided far|ther; but they &s;eem to be of no practical u&s;e, as the modes of cure in all are very &s;imilar.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing</HI> are, immoderate evacua|tions&mdash;cold moi&s;t atmo&s;phere&mdash;irregular or improper diet of crude watery vegetables&mdash;lowne&s;s of &s;pirits&mdash;crudities in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages&mdash;and, in fine, every thing which contributes to produce a relaxed &s;tate of the &s;olids, and poverty of the blood.</P>
<P>The <HI>proximate</HI> or <HI>immediate,</HI> effluvia from moi&s;t, mar&s;hy places called mar&s;h mia&s;ma&mdash;impeded per&s;piration, and relaxation of the &s;olids.</P>
<P>Hence are the poor more &s;ubject to this di&s;ea&s;e than the rich and affluent, tho&s;e who inhabit the country more than tho&s;e who live in large towns and populous cities; for generous diet and warmth are pre&s;ervatives again&s;t the di&s;ea&s;e as well by purify|ing the air, as invigorating the habit.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Affections of both the ner|vous and va&s;cular &s;y&s;tems, from mar&s;h effluvia running through the cour&s;e of a continued fever, of &s;hort duration, beginning with cold and &s;hivering, &s;ucceeded by great heat, and terminating, for the mo&s;t part, in profu&s;e &s;weats, in one fit, which leaves the ha|bit perfectly free from fever for &s;ome time, and returns at &s;tated periods.</P>
<P>CURE. The indications are, to prevent the return of the fe|brile affections, by taking off the too great incitability of the nervous, and irritability of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, by giving tone or &s;trength to the nerves and ve&s;&s;els, and rendering them inca|pable of feeling the effect of morbid particles in the habits, called mar&s;h mia&s;mata, and ejecting them out of the con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>But at the commencement of fevers we cannot immediately di&s;cover of what particular nature they are, and one the lea&s;t
<PB N="258" REF="028021_0254_0FD67265C204F7C0">
dangerous may be converted into others which are more hazard|ous, by injudicious treatment, as an intermittent into a remit|tent, and this into a continued; we &s;hould at the fir&s;t on&s;et be careful, till we are convinced of its &s;pecific nature; therefore to general means we &s;hould only have recour&s;e, which may in all fevers be proper, be they of what &s;ort they may, and this will depend on placing the con&s;titution under &s;uch circum&s;tances as approach nearer to a &s;tate of health.</P>
<P>Therefore, in the beginning, if the pul&s;e give evident &s;igns of fullne&s;s, with other concomitant &s;ymptoms, which indicate eva|cuations to be proper, as we have before &s;pecified in the remit|tent and other fevers, blood may be taken from the arm. Should there be nau&s;ea or &s;ickne&s;s, indicative of foulne&s;s of the &s;tomach, an emetic, (No. 11, 12. 38.) &s;hould be admini&s;tered, and the bow|els cleared by &s;ome gentle aperient medicine. (No. 3. 22 to 24.)</P>
<P>Where the&s;e are thought nece&s;&s;ary, bleeding and cathartics &s;hould precede the admini&s;tration of the emetic, that no mi&s;chief may ari&s;e from its operation, which might be the ca&s;e, &s;hould there be any local conge&s;tion, or too great general fullne&s;s, by rupturing, or di&s;tending the ve&s;&s;els too much, or pu&s;hing the blood too powerfully into the &s;mall capillary tubes, particularly of the head.</P>
<P>If the&s;e prove in&s;ufficient, we mu&s;t proceed to the u&s;e of an|timonials in &s;mall do&s;es, united with the &s;aline mixture, or alone, (No. 6 to 9.) as has been before directed&mdash;and, as &s;oon as the fe|ver &s;hews what it is, take &s;uch &s;teps as its nature demands&mdash;if an intermittent, the mo&s;t powerful medicine, with which ob&s;er|vation and experience has furni&s;hed us, is the Peruvian bark, (193, 194.)&mdash;the quantity given &s;hould be generally &s;o much in the interval between the fits as will prevent their return, that is, in adults, from fix to eight drams.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t efficacious mode of admini&s;tration that has been re|commended, is in powder mixed with red wine.</P>
<P>Where the intermi&s;&s;ion is &s;hort, it is given at &s;horter intervals and vice ver&s;a. I always con&s;ider what is mo&s;t agreeable to the patient re&s;pecting the form, and give a do&s;e every one, two, three, or four hours, as occa&s;ion requires&mdash;the nearer the approach of the u&s;ual time of acce&s;&s;ion, the quicker it &s;hould be repeated, in order that it may at that time exert its fulle&s;t action with its greate&s;t power.</P>
<P>Should the febrile fits be by the&s;e means conquered, we mu&s;t not totally de&s;i&s;t from its u&s;e, but for a few days repeat it at pro|per intervals, every fifth or &s;ixth hour; then for a week, twice
<PB N="259" REF="028021_0255_0FD6722746727B70">
in the twenty-four hours; afterwards, once for the &s;ame, &s;pace.</P>
<P>In winter, after de&s;i&s;ting for a week, or ten days, it will be prudent to return to it again occa&s;ionally for two or three days, and &s;o per&s;i&s;t for a few times, which will effectually &s;ecure the patient from a relap&s;e. Add to this, the patient &s;hould avoid expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the remote or inducing cau&s;es, (257.) u&s;e gen|tle exerci&s;e, particularly riding&mdash;light nutritious diet&mdash;animal food&mdash;red port, claret, or any generous wine, in proper quanti|ties&mdash;&s;uch as are ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, will &s;erve to &s;trengthen the &s;o|lids, and promote a free and regular circulation.</P>
<P>Large draughts of any kind of liquids, however thir&s;ty the patient may be, &s;hould not be allowed in the cold fit, as they will load the &s;tomach too much, and increa&s;e internal oppre&s;&s;ion and unea&s;ine&s;s; but in the hot fit, watery fluids, &s;uch as &s;age, ro&s;emary, balm-tea, &s;mall white-wine whey, and &s;uch like, may be liberally admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>The forms in which the bark is admini&s;tered, are either in bo|lus, pills, electuary, decoction, infu&s;ion with cold or hot water, &s;imple powder, tincture, or extract. (See the do&s;es, 193, 194.)</P>
<P>When we want to throw in as much as po&s;&s;ible in a given time, (&s;ee No. 70.) and let it be admini&s;tered every &s;econd, third, or fourth hour, according to the times of the febrile acce&s;&s;ions. (258.)</P>
<P>Where bark has di&s;agreed, equal portions of qua&s;&s;ia wood and &s;nake-root, infu&s;ed in boiling water, or oak bark in powder, or extract alone, joined with alum, or chamomile flowers, have been efficacious, given during the intermi&s;&s;ions every three or four hours, (No. 71, 72.)&mdash;the virtues al&s;o of cupulae, or &s;caly cup, which embraces the bottom of the acorn, are &s;imilar, in a con&s;i|derable degree, to the oak bark.</P>
<P>The method above laid down will generally be &s;ucce&s;sful in the quotidian and tertian intermittents, (257.) particularly if we couple &s;uch medicines along with the bark as the nature of the con&s;titution of the patient, and the apparent febrile &s;ymptoms in|dicate, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> if the habit appears robu&s;t, the pul&s;e, in the febrile fit, full, hard, and quick, with other inflammatory &s;ymptoms, bleeding has been greatly beneficial; and in the&s;e ca&s;es, joining the bark with &s;aline &s;ub&s;tances, as tartarized kali neutralized with lemon juice, (No. 1.) and the decoction of bark, or fixed &s;al am|moniac, (176.)&mdash;if contrary appearances, cordials and volatiles have &s;upplied their places, as volatile &s;alt of hart&s;horn, (150.) tincture of &s;nake-root. (179.)</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="028021_0256_0FD67267612B8BF0">
Notwith&s;tanding which, they will &s;ometimes prove very ob|&s;tinate&mdash;in the&s;e ca&s;es vomits (No. 11, 12. 38.) given a &s;mall &s;pace of time before the return of the fit, and antimonials in &s;mall do&s;es, (230.) pur&s;ued through the cour&s;e of the hot fit, have been found beneficial&mdash;or, where the habit has been in a highly irri|table &s;tate, opium, (152.) admini&s;tered before the fit, or in the hot &s;tage, &s;eemed of u&s;e.</P>
<P>It is only though in the quartan (257.) intermittent that they are often required, &s;eldom in the others preceding, notwith&s;tand|ing the hot and cold fits continue a &s;horter time than the two for|mer, the whole fit &s;eldom la&s;ting above five hours.</P>
<P>Bark &s;eldom fails of completing a cure, if judiciou&s;ly admini|&s;tered, and the concomitant circum&s;tances which &s;ometimes ap|pear, are properly attended to&mdash;when it does, the failure is ow|ing to &s;ome of the following particulars&mdash;either it has been gi|ven in too &s;mall do&s;es&mdash;not per&s;i&s;ted in long enough&mdash;given in an improper form&mdash;or &s;uch medicines may not have been added to it, nor &s;uch a regimen ob&s;erved, as the peculiar nature of the ca&s;e required.</P>
<P>Sometimes the bark has a tendency to pa&s;s off through the bowels, then it is nece&s;&s;ary to add a few drops of tincture of opium to each do&s;e, which will prevent that effect&mdash;at others the habit will be too co&s;tive, eight or ten grains of rhubarb may be given &s;oon after the ce&s;&s;ation of the fit, to obviate that incon|venience&mdash;&s;ometimes the &s;tomach will not bear it, it may then be admini&s;tered in form of gly&s;ter, (No. 73.)</P>
<P>It is &s;ometimes extremely difficult, and very often impo&s;&s;ible, to get children to take a &s;ufficient quantity of this medicine to an&s;wer the de&s;ired purpo&s;e&mdash;for the be&s;t form to which they will adhere the longe&s;t, (See No. 74.)</P>
<P>But they have been cured by baths, in which half their body has been immer&s;ed, of bark decoction, rubbing the &s;pine with e|qual parts of &s;oap liniment and tincture of opium&mdash;or wearing a wai&s;tcoat made of callico doubled, within which bark has been quilted.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to our progno&s;tics in this di&s;ea&s;e, when eruptions appear upon the lips, they afford a good omen; and the more regularly the fever pa&s;&s;es through its &s;tages, &s;o much the better. Epidemic fevers of this kind are wor&s;e than tho&s;e which occur accidentally to a few&mdash;quartans than quotidians or tertians&mdash;autumnal, than vernal&mdash;Inflammation of the ton&s;ils is con&s;idered as mortal&mdash;&s;ometimes it carries off tho&s;e who are very infirm in the fir&s;t &s;tage&mdash;they frequently leave the con&s;titution extremely weak, &s;o that it requires a long time for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of perfect health; which mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by proper regimen, and

exerci&s;e, as has before been &s;pecified, after the termination of other &s;evere fevers&mdash;&s;ometimes they terminate in jaundice, con|&s;umptions, and drop&s;ies, which, if they ari&s;e from &s;cirrho&s;ities, or hard irre&s;oluble tumours of the vi&s;cera, are fatal.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding what may be thought, with re&s;pect to the nece&s;&s;ity of an early cure, it is not always proper to take off this fever immediately&mdash;for by their continuance, they have been known to cure epilep&s;y, &s;evere coughs from affections of the li|ver; al&s;o hypochondriac and gouty affections have di&s;appeared, by this fever bringing about, from its continuance, &s;ome &s;aluta|ry con&s;titutional changes&mdash;the bleeding piles, &s;mall-pox, and other acute fevers, as well as &s;trong mental affections, have been known, on the other hand, to &s;ubdue the ague.</P>

<P>THUS would I wi&s;h to denominate this fever, becau&s;e the word HECTIC, except from long continued cu&s;tom alone, gives us no determinate idea re&s;pecting it; and where any complaint is peculiarly marked by any known cau&s;e or &s;ymptoms, by which it deviates from all others of the &s;ame cla&s;s, and by which from them it may be di&s;tingui&s;hed, can be confined in a very &s;hort compa&s;s, by terms expre&s;&s;ive of that peculiarity would I have it marked down. As, therefore, hectic fever is of longer duration than any other remittent fever, goes off, when curable, by no known cri&s;is, and, during the whole cour&s;e, has various exa|cerbations and remi&s;&s;ions, I have ventured to alter its appella|tion.</P>
<P>Authors have been much divided with re&s;pect to this fever, <HI>&s;ome</HI> con&s;idering it <HI>always</HI> &s;ymptomatic, deriving its &s;ource from &s;ome local complaint, and depending entirely on that&mdash;others, that it may al&s;o be a primary di&s;ea&s;e, neither ari&s;ing from, nor dependent on any other&mdash;for the latter opinion I confe&s;s my&s;elf an advocate; for, though hectic &s;ymptoms certainly do derive their &s;ource from &s;cirrhous ob&s;tructions and ulcerations of all the vi&s;cera, more particularly of the lungs (28.) and me&s;entery, (46.) becau&s;e it is &s;aid the former are expo&s;ed to injuries from the external air, and the force of the blood circulating through

their &s;ub&s;tance; the latter is &s;ubject to the &s;ame from compre&s;|&s;ion of the aliments in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, from vi&s;cid chyle, (43.) and the &s;lower circulation of the blood through the inte&s;tines; &s;till may they ari&s;e immediately from &s;ome acrimony of the blood, becau&s;e they have occurred certainly where no one vi&s;cus, through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, was affected more than the re&s;t; nor do the vi&s;ceral ob&s;tructions, which are always found on di&s;&s;ection, de&s;troy the validity of this opinion; for they are the effects, as well as cau&s;es, of hectic fevers&mdash;of which we &s;hall be convinced, if we will only examine the remote or inducing cau&s;es, which we &s;hall &s;hortly &s;pecify.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. The &s;ymptoms are very &s;imilar to what appear in con&s;umption of the lungs&mdash;the patients labouring un|der this complaint have a continued, dry, unnatural heat; they lo&s;e their appetite, and their pul&s;e is &s;mall, weak, and frequent, though fuller and &s;tronger after eating; they have no &s;en&s;ation of &s;ickne&s;s; after meals a flu&s;hing of the cheeks comes on; and their urine is in general red, and covered with an oily pellicle; their &s;leep by no means refre&s;hes them; they become hollow-ey|ed; their &s;kin grows har&s;h, the belly &s;inks inwards; a colliqua|tive loo&s;ene&s;s comes on, the body grows t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bid, and death makes its approach by &s;low degrees.</P>
<P>On this fever the &s;agacious Dr. Heberden has made &s;everal u&s;eful remarks in the London Medical Tran&s;actions, Vol. II. page 1, &amp;c. among&s;t which he &s;ays, <Q>the mo&s;t certain mark of this fever is, when the &s;weat, which u&s;ually attends this fever, is over; the fever will &s;ometimes continue, and in the middle the chillne&s;s will return.</Q></P>
<P>This is very readily di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other fevers by the &s;lowne&s;s of its progre&s;s&mdash;but from the fir&s;t &s;tage of the watery head, with great difficulty, and not without the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous attention to the &s;ymptoms peculiar to each.</P>
<P>CAUSES. <HI>Remote</HI> or <HI>inducing</HI> are, immoderate and long continued mental affections&mdash;long watchings&mdash;too great evacua|tions, whether of blood, milk, &s;emen, &s;aliva, pus, &s;weat, or the alvine fluids&mdash;too acrid medicines, as mercurial preparations, &s;trong purges, too often repeated&mdash;debility of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, by which the chyle, either crude or corrupted, is conveyed into the circulating ma&s;s of fluids&mdash;preceding di&s;ea&s;es, as intermit|tents, &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, drop&s;y, &s;curvy, king's evil &s;o called&mdash;&s;uppre&s;&s;ed evacuations&mdash;frequent intoxication&mdash;old people and infants are al&s;o &s;ubject to it, from their age alone, dependent up|on con&s;titutional debility.</P>
<P>The <HI>proximate</HI> or <HI>immediate,</HI> both from the preceding cau&s;es, and the modes of cure, are &s;aid to be, a &s;aline and alcale&s;cent
<PB N="263" REF="028021_0259_0FD6722F902A2730">
&s;tate of the fluids&mdash;whether this may be the preci&s;e ca&s;e, per|haps it may be difficult to determine&mdash;though mucilaginous ma|terials and acids are &s;aid to be beneficial, yet it is highly proba|ble &s;ome &s;pecies of acrimony takes place in the habit, as the fun|damental principle of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Febrile affections long con|tinued, having frequent increa&s;e of violence, no perceptible in|termi&s;&s;ion, and not terminating in cri&s;is, attended with irregular va&s;cular action increa&s;ing often in the day, more &s;o in the even|ing; and generally at the beginning with tenacity, towards the termination, with putre&s;cency of the blood.</P>
<P>CURE. The indications are, to mitigate febrile affections, and correct the acrimony of the fluids.</P>
<P>If care is taken of this complaint at an early period, and pro|per advice admini&s;tered, a cure may be effected&mdash;but, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, patients often delay too long, and confide either in their own imaginary knowledge, or the family receipts of &s;ome humane old woman, till little chance remains for the &s;kill of the more judicious; for when the powers of the con&s;titution become to be greatly debilitated&mdash;the hair falls off&mdash;a colliqua|tive di&s;&s;olving loo&s;ene&s;s, night &s;weats, and &s;wellings of the legs come on&mdash;the urine begins to have an oily appearance, and the countenance a&s;&s;umes a cadaverous a&s;pect, becoming thin and gha&s;t|ly, all pro&s;pect of warding off the fatal blow is irrecoverably gone, the patient is got beyond the reach of our art, and death quick|ly clo&s;es the fatal &s;cene.</P>
<P>In the beginning, where we can be of &s;ervice, we mu&s;t fir&s;t of all clear <HI>the &s;tomach and bowels</HI> by gentle emetics, (No. 11, 12.) and mild aperients, chiefly rhubarb&mdash;<HI>abate the febrile heat</HI> by &s;mall do&s;es of Polychre&s;t &s;alt, (171.) and nitre, (177.) and giving &s;uch do&s;es of oil of ca&s;tor, manna, or &s;ome &s;uch like cooling and gent|ly opening medicines, as will keep the body free from co&s;tive|ne&s;s, (171, 172.)&mdash;<HI>in order to &s;heath the acrimony of the fluids,</HI> we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to demulcents, (187.) emollients, (137.) and particularly, which will be more effectual, to a well-regulat|ed diet and regimen.</P>
<P>The food &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of chicken broth, jellies, and if the &s;to|mach will bear them, oy&s;ters&mdash;milk, particularly women's or a&s;s'&mdash;goat's whey&mdash;buttermilk, with Bri&s;tol or Seltzer water. The patient &s;hould live in a clear country air, on a dry &s;oil; keep cheerful company; ride con&s;tantly on hor&s;eback, or travel from place to place&mdash;or he &s;hould take a voyage to &s;ea, or &s;ail every day, for that has been known to &s;ave numbers in the beginning of this di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;ome who were rather advanced; but to all it affords great relief. And at the &s;ame time, with intent to keep
<PB N="264" REF="028021_0260_0FD6726871E9FFF8">
up the tone of the &s;y&s;tem, mild a&s;tringents, &s;light infu&s;ions of bark, one ounce and an half, with ten drops of dilute vitriolic acid may be given twice a day, or two or three ounces of tinc|ture of ro&s;es al&s;o; three or four drams of the con&s;erve may be mixed with &s;ix or eight ounces of milk, and taken two or three times, or oftener, in the day;&mdash;as for common drink, they &s;hould u&s;e barley-water, decoction of mar&s;h-mallows, lin&s;eed-tea, or that of colts-foot. Bri&s;tol water has been e&s;teemed highly &s;ervicea|ble; but it is often deferred too late. In the earlie&s;t &s;tages of this di&s;ea&s;e it &s;hould be applied to, for in them it promi&s;es to be of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, little, as we have before remarked, being capable of being done in the more advanced or latter pe|riods.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XII. ERUPTIVE FEVERS.</HEAD>
<P>SO called from the Latin word <HI>erumpo,</HI> to break out, and al&s;o in medical language EXANTHEMATOUS, from the Greek word <HI>exanthema,</HI> pu&s;tula, a pu&s;tule, becau&s;e the&s;e eruptions make their appearance on the &s;urface of the &s;kin&mdash;and this is done by the effort of nature to throw out &s;ome matter offen&s;ive to the con&s;titution, which was creative of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Now though the&s;e partake of the nature of &s;ome of tho&s;e we have mentioned in Section 8th, &s;till they derive their names from the eruptions with which they are con&s;tantly accompanied, and of the&s;e there are &s;everal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and varieties&mdash;of which we &s;hall treat &s;eparately, becau&s;e they require different modes of manage|ment, according to the different effects they produce upon the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>And the&s;e effects will be a&s;&s;i&s;ted or alleviated, by attending more to the habit of the patient than to the &s;pecific nature of the morbid particles which produce them; for we know nothing of the materials, or the parts of which they are formed, con&s;equent|ly cannot be able to find out any &s;pecific remedy which can cor|rect them, &s;o that the di&s;ea&s;e, of which they are the &s;ource, may be &s;ubdued, by weakening or de&s;troying the power inherent in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Therefore, in all our medical exertions, we attempt only to prevent the ill con&s;equences they are likely to produce, by &s;o guarding the con&s;titution, that nature may be empowered to &s;e|parate
<PB N="265" REF="028021_0261_0FD67230E38458A0">
and throw out what would, if &s;uffered to remain, prove fatal to the human machine, either producing immediate death, or bringing on other maladies which would in time have a &s;imi|lar termination.</P>
<P>Now all the&s;e fevers of which we are going to treat are e&s;teem|ed infectious, con&s;equently contagious; for the&s;e two terms are u&s;ed &s;ynonymou&s;ly by the mo&s;t learned authorities. Notwith|&s;tanding which, I would endeavour to make &s;ome di&s;crimination between them, and am warranted in the attempt, if any the lea&s;t benefit can be derived to &s;ociety by the ob&s;ervance of &s;uch a di&s;|tinction; to prove which, I a&s;&s;ert, that there are &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es which are acquired by the particles of morbid matter floating in the circumambient atmo&s;phere, either from that matter being in|haled by the lungs, impregnating what we eat or drink; or ab|&s;orbed by the inhaling ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin, no&s;e, or fauces, whil&s;t others are communicated from contact alone&mdash;hence the former of the&s;e I would term <HI>infectious,</HI> the latter <HI>contagious;</HI> and for this rea&s;on the modes of prevention would be different&mdash;for in a country or town where the fir&s;t was rife, quitting tho&s;e places is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; but where the la&s;t, cautious re&s;idence in the &s;ame is &s;ufficient, avoiding commerce with per&s;ons &s;o contami|nated; or touching any materials, which are capable of retaining the contagious matter, that have by them been u&s;ed or handled. Be&s;ides, in this county, it &s;hews, in ca&s;es of the plague, the &s;e|curity in drawing lines of circumvallation to prevent its pro|gre&s;s; indeed other modes, from this idea, might be found out of great utility under the&s;e unhappy circum&s;tances. Support|ed by the&s;e rea&s;ons, I &s;hall beg leave to pre&s;erve the difference between the two terms, and proceed to treat on eruptive fevers from infection; and, fir&s;t, on the</P>

<HEAD>&sect; 1. SMALL-POX, or POCKS.</HEAD>
<P>Becau&s;e we call a &s;ingle pu&s;tule <HI>pock</HI>&mdash;this &s;eems to be derived from the Saxon word <HI>pocca,</HI> pocket, or the French <HI>poche,</HI> a &s;mall bag. The Latins gave the di&s;ea&s;e the term <HI>variolae,</HI> becau&s;e from the eruptions it altered the appearance of the &s;kin.</P>
<P>This complaint is occa&s;ioned by morbid matter of a peculiar nature ab&s;orbed into the habit from the external air, from con|tact of a per&s;on infected, or from inoculation, either by the in|haling ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin, lungs, membranes of the no&s;e and mouth, or fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages&mdash;and has been divided agreeable to the cuticular appearances, into di&s;tinct, confluent, coherent&mdash;or into common, <HI>cry&s;talline</HI> eruptions full of thin &s;erous matter&mdash;<HI>verru|cous,</HI>

re&s;embling warts&mdash;or <HI>bloody,</HI> filled with red fluid, or blood in a broken &s;tate.</P>
<P>However generally now we adhere to the terms <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> and <HI>confluent;</HI> but this &s;eems of little u&s;e in practice; for they may be di&s;tinct, yet of a very bad kind; and confluent, yet very good; therefore the more eligible divi&s;ion appears to be into <HI>&s;im|ple</HI> and <HI>malignant</HI>&mdash;the fir&s;t comprehending tho&s;e which are the lea&s;t, the la&s;t, tho&s;e which are the mo&s;t dangerous.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e has four &s;tages: the fir&s;t, the <HI>febrile,</HI> which con|tinues three days&mdash;2d, the <HI>eruptive,</HI> two days&mdash;3d, the <HI>&s;uppura|tive,</HI> five or &s;even&mdash;4th, the <HI>ex&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ccative,</HI> or &s;tage in which the pu&s;tules dry, two or four days&mdash;or &s;ometimes another fever comes on, called the <HI>&s;econdary.</HI></P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. It generally commences with &s;ymptoms of an inflammatory fever, from whence the particles of the mor|bid virus are con&s;idered not only highly &s;ubtilized, but inflam|matory and &s;timulant, attended with nau&s;ea or vomiting&mdash;pain in the head and back&mdash;tightne&s;s about the pit of the &s;tomach&mdash;the patients are very drow&s;y, &s;ometimes delirious&mdash;in grown people often &s;weats break out on the fir&s;t days, and infants are apt to be &s;eized with convul&s;ions&mdash;the &s;kin though, in general, is rather moi&s;t and &s;oft&mdash;the upper orifice of the &s;tomach &s;ometimes acutely painful, and al&s;o the &s;ides.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ymptoms continue three or four days, on which appear &s;mall red &s;pecks like flea-bites; which, when pre&s;&s;ed with the finger, may be felt hard in the &s;kin, and thus may be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from other eruptions, particularly the mea&s;les, which, on their fir&s;t appearance, are very &s;eldom &s;o hard, or can be felt in this manner, as not elevating the cuticle &s;o much; fir&s;t on the face, and &s;cattered on the hands, neck, and brea&s;t; and with the&s;e commences <HI>the &s;econd &s;tage;</HI> from which period the pu&s;tules keep continually increa&s;ing, and diffu&s;ing them&s;elves over every part of the body; at which time the fever goes off when the erup|tion is completed; after this they inflame, begin to be prominent above the &s;kin, are painful, hot, and fill about the fifth day; and have round their ba&s;is a circular florid redne&s;s&mdash;the throat al&s;o is painful, and inflamed commonly&mdash;the face begins to &s;well and puff up, for the mo&s;t part, on the &s;eventh day, &s;o much, that they generally clo&s;e the eyes, and occa&s;ion blindne&s;s.</P>
<P>At this period, the commencement of <HI>the third &s;tage,</HI> as if from external irritation, &s;oliciting the perfect and complete di&s;charge of morbid matter, fre&s;h febrile &s;ymptoms ari&s;e, which continue to the ninth, tenth, or eleventh day, according to the &s;everity of the di&s;ea&s;e, or quantity of the eruption. The pu&s;tules having acquired their full &s;ize, mo&s;t of them as big as pea&s;e, are filled
<PB N="267" REF="028021_0263_0FD67231EA2C2868">
with a whiti&s;h or yellowi&s;h matter; this concludes the third &s;tage; and then the matter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">zes out at the top of the eruptions, dries, turns of a dark colour, and forms hard &s;cabs, and this is in the &s;ame order in which they made their appearance&mdash;and, as the face &s;ub&s;ides, the feet and hands &s;well, and &s;ub&s;ide not totally till the fourteenth day, at which period the di&s;ea&s;e is con&s;idered to have completely fini&s;hed its cour&s;e, which forms the conclu&s;ion of <HI>the fourth &s;tage.</HI></P>
<P>This is in general the progre&s;s of the &s;imple or mild &s;pecies&mdash;though &s;ometimes another fever, called SECONDARY, will come on, when the eruptions have run &s;o together, that they form one uniform cru&s;t, and by that means ob&s;truct per&s;piration; &s;o that, in&s;tead of the quantity of variolous matter pa&s;&s;ing out of the ha|bit, it is again re-ab&s;orbed, and the inte&s;tines are loaded with an offen&s;ive collection of acrid materials, which create a fever of the remittent cla&s;s that often proves fatal.</P>
<P>But in the confluent &s;ort there are &s;ome peculiarities which ought to be &s;pecified; and, therefore, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that in the&s;e the pu&s;tules break out &s;ooner, on the &s;econd or third day; the febrile &s;ymptoms run on with a greater degree of violence&mdash;and on the appearance of the eruptions, or a day or two after, which happens now and then in the di&s;tinct &s;ort a <HI>&s;pitting</HI> will come on, gradually increa&s;ing to a &s;alivation in grown people&mdash;in infants a <HI>loo&s;ene&s;s</HI> &s;upplies the place&mdash;though in common the attendant fever of the &s;mall-pox is of the inflammatory kind, yet, in the more complicated &s;ort, the fever a&s;&s;umes a different type, and puts on the appearance either of&mdash;1&s;t, an <HI>inflammatory remittent</HI>&mdash;2dly, <HI>nervous</HI>&mdash;3dly, <HI>putrid fever</HI>&mdash;or is a&s;&s;ociated, 4thly, <HI>with &s;ymptoms of ay&s;entery.</HI></P>
<P>IN THE FIRST, the febrile affections run very high, with ex|ce&s;&s;ive heat, and great pro&s;tration of &s;trength&mdash;the &s;kin is dry and hot&mdash;the arteries, called carotids, running through the neck into the &s;uperior parts, throb&mdash;the tendons, (22.) grow &s;tiff&mdash;the eyes are bright, vivid, and full of blood&mdash;the head and loins are painful, often without any delirium or drow&s;y di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;when the eruption is fini&s;hed, if the patient dies not before the com|pletion, which, from the violence of the fever, is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, the head-ach, pain in the loins, vomiting, and other &s;ymp|toms, are relieved; but the fever revives its former force, or continues, and has increa&s;e of febrile affections every thirty-&s;ix hours&mdash;hence termed <HI>tertian;</HI>&mdash;at this period there ari&s;e want of &s;leep, delirium, anxiety&mdash;there al&s;o come on bleeding of the no&s;e, copious &s;weats&mdash;then heat, and dryne&s;s of the &s;kin&mdash;very often miliary eruptions break out in &s;paces between the pu&s;tules, or &s;mall purple &s;pots like flea-bit&mdash;&s;ometimes an ery&s;ipclatous in|flam|mation
<PB N="268" REF="028021_0264_0FD6726DE65FAF48">
will occupy the head and face, and occa&s;ion a large inflammatory &s;welling&mdash;the febrile and other &s;ymptoms increa&s;e in the &s;uppurating &s;tate, with to&s;&s;ing and delirium&mdash;the pu&s;tules &s;ubdue not, nor &s;eem to be of a very bad &s;ort&mdash;&s;ometimes though they grow black and mortify&mdash;then the patients lie in a &s;tate of aparent &s;leep, and convul&s;ions clo&s;e the &s;cene.</P>
<P>IN THE SECOND, at the commencment, there is great pro&s;tra|tion of &s;trength, lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, ob&s;cure febrile &s;ymptoms, ex|treme nau&s;ea, &s;ickne&s;s, and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The pu&s;tules never pu&s;h forth perfectly, nor maturate kindly, but many lurk in the &s;kin; and tho&s;e which elevate them&s;elves a little above it, are flat and depre&s;&s;ed, containing a thin aqueous fluid, and have a &s;mall black &s;pot in the middle&mdash;the face, when the eruption is copious and runs together, never &s;wells, but looks as if covered with a yellowi&s;h &s;kin, &s;omething like a macerated, bladder of that colour.</P>
<P>A thin &s;erous loo&s;ene&s;s generally comes on&mdash;if not, convul&s;i|ons put a period to the unfortunate patient's exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>IN THE THIRD, the &s;ymptoms preceding the eruptions are nearly &s;imilar to the former; but the pu&s;tules are black; the bottoms of which are in a mortified &s;tate; indeed, the texture of the blood is &s;o broken by the putre&s;cent acrimony, that it runs off by urine, and various other haemorrhages; the &s;paces between the pu&s;tules are black, and large broad &s;pots, called vi|bices, or &s;mall ones, like flea-bites, are formed on the &s;kin; be|&s;ides, the red portion of the blood not only mixes with the &s;erum, and fills the eruption, but it rai&s;es large bli&s;ters el&s;e|where.</P>
<P>The&s;e pu&s;tules, which are only a little elevated, beginning to appear upon the &s;econd day, are black; the urine, for the mo&s;t part, is bloody; as are al&s;o the &s;tools, &s;pittings, vomitings, and in &s;ome even the tears; the fever is violent, and the febrile fits almo&s;t in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>IN THE FOURTH, which was called DYSENTERIC, becau&s;e it happened in the year 1670, at the time of the epidemic dy&s;ente|ry, and partook, in &s;ome degree, of its nature; or, becau&s;e the matter of the &s;mall-pox was often thrown out of the con&s;titution by inte&s;tinal evacuation, when treated by the warm regimen, not un|common in tho&s;e days.</P>
<P>In this the eruption does not occur, as in the mild &s;ort, on the fourth, but on the third day; the pu&s;tules are of a le&s;s &s;ize al|ways, and are &s;harper, or more pointed at the top, and grow blacki&s;h towards the conclu&s;ion&mdash;be&s;ides, a copious di&s;charge of &s;aliva, as in the confluent kind, is often a concomitant. Should the acrimony of the putrid, which produces the alvine flux, that

forms the characteri&s;tic &s;ign of this &s;pecies of &s;mall-pox, be ve|ry copious and active, occa&s;ioning the di&s;charge to be violent, it almo&s;t always proves mortal.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing</HI> of this, as well as of eve|ry other &s;pecies of infectious or contagious fever, is a predi&s;po|&s;ition, or peculiarity of the con&s;titution to feel the impre&s;&s;ions made by the morbid matter, productive of di&s;tre&s;s in the mov|ing &s;olids, and alteration of the fluids of the machine.</P>

The only certain ones are the eruptions them&s;elves, with their progre&s;&s;ive concomitant &s;ymptoms, the appearance of which may be &s;u&s;pected in the fir&s;t &s;tage, it the attack &s;hould be &s;udden&mdash;if the &s;mall-pox &s;hould be the reigning epidemic, or the patient &s;o &s;ituated, that he has been thrown in the way of this &s;pecific infection&mdash;if pain &s;hould affect the back part of the head, &s;auces, loins, particularly the pit of the &s;tomach, attended with vomiting, and that pain increa&s;ed on pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P>CURE. The indications are, to dimini&s;h the a&s;&s;imilating or contaminating power of the morbid matter, and keep the fever within &s;uch bounds, that nature &s;hall be enabled to &s;eparate from and throw out of the habit the offen&s;ive materials that cau&s;e the di&s;tre&s;s, which is done by &s;o regulating the motions of the ner|vous and va&s;cular &s;y&s;tems, that the con&s;titution may be put into a &s;tate to mitigate and &s;upport the &s;ucceeding conte&s;t with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, and freedom from danger.</P>
<P>And this knowledge we &s;hall acquire, by con&s;idering the &s;itua|tion of the habit, the mode of living, and &s;ea&s;on of the year, with re&s;pect to the weather or con&s;titution of the air, as the&s;e will di&s;po&s;e more or le&s;s to the production of inflammatory, ner|vous, or putre&s;cent febrile affections; for I am certain, that, ac|cording to the nature of the fever, &s;o are we to regulate our con|duct, and hence ob&s;erve tho&s;e rules which have been previou&s;ly laid down in the management of tho&s;e different fevers &s;pecified in our eighth and ninth &s;ections.</P>
<P>Sometimes the di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o extremely mild, that there is no need of medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, though at the clo&s;e, in order to clear the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages from any foulne&s;s or offen&s;ive matter which may have been collected there during the progre&s;s of the complaint, it would be right to give two or three purges. (No. 3. 19 to 24.)</P>
<P>At others, it is of a very dangerous nature, and requires the
<PB N="270" REF="028021_0266_0FD67273F39F0AC8">
a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;agacity of no &s;mall &s;hare of medical knowledge, as it is accompanied with &s;uch a variety of threatening &s;ymp|toms.</P>
<P>Should the &s;mall-pox attack &s;trong, hale, robu&s;t habits, where inflammatory &s;ymptoms run high, which they &s;ometimes do to &s;uch a degree, as to affect the brain, throat, or lungs, &s;o as to pro|duce delirium, &s;uffocation, and extreme difficulty of breathing; according to the violence of the &s;ymptoms we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to bleeding, and that repeated, if they give not way to the fir&s;t operation&mdash;indeed, if the pul&s;e is hard and full; the heat con&s;i|derably above the natural &s;tandard; the urine high-coloured; the pain in the head, back, and loins acute; the bleeding at the beginning &s;hould be copious&mdash;and, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, blood may be taken even at the height, or any intermediate &s;tage&mdash;we may al&s;o give antimonials, nitrous and cooling medicines, and &s;uch other things as have been advi&s;ed in cure of inflamma|tory fevers, (210, &amp;c.) for the &s;ame rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>If the head &s;hould be violently affected, the feet may be bath|ed in warm water, and warm fomentations, or poultices, appli|ed to them; for the&s;e will &s;olicit a freer circulation downwards, a more copious eruption into the extremities, and dimini&s;h the quantity of variolous matter, which otherwi&s;e would appear in the more &s;uperior parts.</P>
<P>After once or twice bleeding, a gentle emetic, (No. 11, 12. 38.) would be u&s;eful, and clearing the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages with &s;ome mild aperient, (No. 3. 22 to 24.) or at lea&s;t repeated gly&s;ters every, or every other day, (No. 25, 26.)</P>
<P>By the means above directed, we reduce the active power of the &s;y&s;tem, that it may not be hindered from throwing off the matter of the &s;mall-pox, by the too great di&s;turbance and di&s;tre&s;s occa&s;ioned by the rapidity and violence of febrile ac|tion.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the train of &s;ymptoms be &s;uch as indicate the pre|&s;ence of a <HI>nervous fever,</HI> (325.) we mu&s;t endeavour to rou&s;e the va&s;cular motions, and increa&s;e the activity of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, in the manner we have directed in nervous fever, (216.) for, without this, there will only be a partial &s;eparation of the vari|olous matter thrown out upon the &s;urface of the body; and the internal parts, &s;uch as the brain, &s;tomach, lungs, and bowels, be more loaded, and the fluids not perfectly free from morbid par|ticles. To obviate the&s;e inconveniencies, we mu&s;t <HI>not</HI> do any thing that is likely to turn the humours upon the bowels, nor take away any blood; for the&s;e would weaken the &s;y&s;tem, alrea|dy in too debilitated a &s;tate, and render the fluids too acrimoni|ous; we mu&s;t try to invigorate the con&s;titution, in order that
<PB N="271" REF="028021_0267_0FD67235AD5043F8">
the blood may circulate with proper freedom externally, by wine, wine-whey, volatiles, and cordials, (218.)</P>
<P>The load, nau&s;ea, anxiety, and oppre&s;&s;ion, which are almo&s;t always con&s;tant concomitants in this &s;pecies of febrile affection, might be relieved by an emetic. (247.) for the &s;hock would tend in &s;ome degree to rou&s;e the &s;y&s;tem, and promote the eruption by that means.</P>
<P>Should the fever attendant be of the <HI>putrid kind,</HI> and betray &s;ymptoms of prevalent putre&s;cency in the humours, we mu&s;t not have recour&s;e to the lancet; for bleeding would hurry the con|&s;titution rapidly into all tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs which ari&s;e from ex|treme debilitated nervous action, and broken texture of the blood, as before explained when treating on putrid fever, (223.)&mdash;here we mu&s;t depend upon bark, and &s;uch things as were &s;pecified when treating on that malady.</P>
<P>In order to promote &s;ucce&s;s in treating this complaint, in the be&s;t manner we can, by procuring a &s;eparation and expul&s;ion of the morbid matter, we mu&s;t, indi&s;putably, pay attention to the preci&s;e nature of the fever; for it is by properly regulating that from whence we can hope for perfect and la&s;ting relief.</P>
<P>Particular occurrences pre&s;ent them&s;elves frequently, which call for our attention in an e&s;pecial manner, added to the general plans we have &s;pecifically pointed out, in which we mu&s;t at|tempt to imitate nature in her operations.</P>
<P>When in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration is too much impeded by the pu&s;|tules crowding &s;o clo&s;e together, and ob&s;tructing the pores of the &s;kin, &s;he produces either a copious &s;pitting, free di&s;charge of u|rine, or loo&s;ene&s;s, to make up that defect, or lodges the aqueous fluid in &s;ome part of the cellular membrane (26.) of the hands and feet, which at that time put on drop&s;ical appearances&mdash;hence is pointed out to us the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;erous evacuations.</P>
<P>It is therefore incumbent upon us to endeavour to promote the &s;low of urine from the completion of the eruption to the turn, by the u&s;e of diuretics; the &s;afe&s;t of which is aethereal &s;pirits of nitre, (176.) and taking the patients now and then out of bed, and expo&s;ing them to the cool air.</P>
<P>Small do&s;es of calomel, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, have been attended with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, as they often promote a &s;pitting, or increa&s;e the di&s;charge of urine; or, &s;hould we be afraid of deter|mining the humours too much to the bowels, it may be thrown into the habit in form of ointment, rubbed in above the knee, or on the in&s;ide of the thighs.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e di&s;charges are defective, or cea&s;e altogether, and there is no &s;welling in the extremities &s;ufficient to counterbalance the decrea&s;ed or ob&s;tructed evacuations, the ankles or wri&s;ts mu&s;t
<PB N="272" REF="028021_0268_0FD67277DB33A750">
be bli&s;tered, by in&s;inuating &s;ome bli&s;tering ointment into the &s;paces between the pu&s;tules&mdash;and if this &s;ucceeds, by creating a free di&s;charge, the danger which before threatened may be hap|pily prevented&mdash;if not, we &s;hall have rea&s;on to fear a fatal con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sometimes re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s will be occa&s;ioned, and the febrile &s;ymp|toms increa&s;ed, by irritation on the &s;urface of the body, creating pain, as the pu&s;tules proceed to perfect maturation and dryne&s;s&mdash;here opiates (151.) (No. 4, 5.) procure ea&s;e and &s;leep, forward &s;uppuration, expedite &s;eparation and expul&s;ion, by preventing internal di&s;turbance in the &s;y&s;tem from the cau&s;es above &s;pecifi|ed. But, perhaps, by their u&s;e the body may be rendered co&s;|tive; or if &s;o, at this period, from any other cau&s;e, gentle aperi|ent medicines have been recommended; but gly&s;ters, (No. 25, 26.) every day till the dryne&s;s of the pocks takes place, are more eligible, as from them there can be no danger of creating the &s;malle&s;t di&s;turbance in the habit, nor of determining the fluids too much to the inte&s;tines, &s;o as to run the lea&s;t ri&s;que of induc|ing a loo&s;ene&s;s; and they will al&s;o effectually a&s;&s;i&s;t in preventing an increa&s;e of febrile di&s;tre&s;s, which might ari&s;e from collections of acrimonious matters in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>Sometimes after the incru&s;tation is perfectly formed, from the re&s;orption of pus, offen&s;ive acrid matters in the fir&s;t pa&s;|&s;ages, or the ab&s;orption of acrimonious or foetid particles from foul linen, the &s;econdary fever is apt to ari&s;e. In or|der to prevent which, the patient &s;hould have his linen changed, be put into fre&s;h &s;heets well aired, every thing be removed from him which can be &s;uppo&s;ed to harbour offen&s;ive matter, and a purge, (169, &amp;c.) (No. 19 to 22.) given as &s;oon as the cru&s;t is actually formed.</P>
<P>Though &s;ome conjectured, with equal if not with more pro|bability, that this fever ari&s;es from the imperfect &s;eparation or expul&s;ion of the variolous matter, and that it becomes the in&s;tru|ment of nature to free the habit from what remains.</P>
<P>However, be the ca&s;e which it may, if it runs high, and is at|tended with violent head-ach, great oppre&s;&s;ion, and difficulty of breathing, bleeding may be nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;o long as the pul&s;e can &s;upport the operation well, it may be repeated&mdash;bli&s;ters &s;hould afterwards be applied&mdash;and purgatives admini&s;tered, if the pul&s;e does not flag&mdash;and vegetable acids &s;hould be mixed with common drinks&mdash;but &s;hould the &s;trength fail, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to cordials.</P>
<P>If it goes not off by the&s;e means, it will, in all probability, put on the appearance of a remittent fever, and as &s;uch mu&s;t be con&s;idered&mdash;for the &s;ubduction of which, we mu&s;t, as in ca&s;es of
<PB N="273" REF="028021_0269_0FD67236F40FFCD8">
tho&s;e fevers before &s;pecified, (252.) apply to the bark, (253) and with re&s;pect to the quantity to be applied, the age of the patient, and violence of the di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t regulate our judgment.</P>
<P>Some, in order to mitigate or prevent this fever, have advi&s;ed the pu&s;tules, as &s;oon as they are fully matured, where they are of the confluent kind, to be opened as they ripen, in the order they make their appearance. I am, however, far at pre&s;ent from recommending the adoption of &s;uch a plan, as I &s;hould be fearful of the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences en&s;uing from &s;uch a practice, particularly where the fever, after the eruption, &s;till continued with any degree of force; for it is very probable that, from thence, there is not a due &s;eparation of the morbid materials, and that the <HI>&s;econdary fever</HI> is very often, at lea&s;t, <HI>an effort of nature</HI> to throw what remains out of the habit&mdash;and that by the irrita|tion on the &s;kin this purpo&s;e might better be effected, than by its being taken off; for from &s;uch attempts, there has been rea&s;on to believe death the con&s;equence. Much mi&s;chief has accrued from applications made to gouty limbs, from the impetuo&s;ity of the &s;ufferers to take off the pain ari&s;ing from that cau&s;e, before the whole of the gouty matter had been depo&s;ited; and in the&s;e two ca&s;es the rea&s;oning is nearly &s;imilar, as well as &s;ome others; and it is well known, that nature frequently makes pain ari&s;ing from &s;ome irritating power the &s;ole cau&s;e of con&s;titutional relief. I would therefore advi&s;e great circum&s;pection on the pre&s;ent point, which only can be warranted by practical certainty, not whim&s;i|cal, though ingenious, conjecture.</P>
<P>Sometimes the &s;mall-pox will be attended with a remittent fe|ver, (250, &amp;c.) verging to the inflammatory cla&s;s; then the di&s;|ea&s;e mu&s;t be treated in the &s;ame manner as we have delivered when treating on that fever. (210.) (See 252.)</P>
<P>Sometimes the eruptions will put on different appearances, (265.) which from thence are called CRYSTALLINE, and be attended with a nervous fever; in this ca&s;e therefore, we chiefly depend on bli&s;ters and vinous cordials, with &s;uch other aids as we have &s;pecified in the treatment of the &s;low nervous fever. (216.) Or SANGUINE|OUS or BLOODY, and have for their concomitant a putrid fever; in which ca&s;e, without &s;ome &s;ervice can be done in the begin|ning, not one ray of hope remains for our &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;for which pur|po&s;e we mu&s;t depend upon bark, and &s;uch other anti&s;eptics, (192.) as are &s;uppo&s;ed to have the mo&s;t powerful and immediate action, the principal of which is alum, (137, &amp;c.) (No. 56.) and pur&s;ue the mode of management throughout, as recommended in the putrid fever. (223.)</P>
<P>Or, they are attended with extreme pain, and violent flux from the bowels, putting on the appearance of dy&s;entery, (268.)
<PB N="274" REF="028021_0270_0FD67278F0D603A0">
&mdash;in this ca&s;e we mu&s;t endeavour to retard the flux, by &s;ome gen|tle cordial antacids, of the &s;hell or earthy kind, (19<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.) called ab|&s;orbents, (No. 42, 43.) or the white decoction, with red port or claret, or a&s;tringent draughts. (No. 75, 76.)</P>
<P>But in this complaint much nicety is required&mdash;for alvine fluxes are not always to be con&s;idered morbid, they are &s;ometimes critical, and the means of which nature makes u&s;e to carry mor|bid virus out of the habit&mdash;if, therefore, the pul&s;e does not &s;ink, but continues to move with &s;trength and greater freedom, and the oppre&s;&s;ive &s;ymptoms are all alleviated, the u&s;e of a&s;tringents &s;hould be cautiou&s;ly admini&s;tered. It would be more advi&s;able, to &s;upport the patient by mild cordials, and exhibit &s;uch medi|cines as would &s;heath the bowels, and &s;uffer the matter to pa&s;s through them with the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;&s;mall do&s;es of ipecacu|anha (No. 57.) will be beneficial, and preparations from the cla&s;s of the demulcents, as mixtures of gum tragaoanth, Arabic, &s;tarch, and &s;uch like; and, towards the conclu&s;ion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, joined with &s;ome of the mild a&s;tringents, might be u&s;ed. (No. 77, 78.)</P>
<P>With regard to the diet, it is always to be adapted to the na|ture of the fever, during its continuance, which may be collect|ed from what has been &s;aid on this head, when treating of the inflammatory, nervous, and putrid fevers. The apartments mu&s;t be kept cool, and the patients fit up &s;ome hours every day, if the circum&s;tances of their ca&s;e will permit&mdash;and after the com|plaint has fini&s;hed its cour&s;e, purgatives &s;hould, at proper inter|vals, be repeated, to clear the habit of any remains of morbid particles; and the &s;ame cour&s;e pur&s;ued for the recovery of the &s;trength, as after the conclu&s;ion of other fevers, where the con|&s;titution has been much harra&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>It is al&s;o a bad omen <HI>if the &s;econdary fever appears before the retroce&s;&s;ion of the pu&s;tules&mdash;if the face &s;ub&s;ides, and the &s;alivation or &s;pitting cea&s;es, and the hands and arms &s;well not in the &s;ame propor|tion,</HI> in the confluent &s;ort, it is a &s;ign of death.</P>

<P>Before we clo&s;e this part of our &s;ubject, we mu&s;t beg leave to make one general ob&s;ervation re&s;pecting all eruptive fevers, as well as the &s;mall-pox&mdash;that as many, though their eruptions a|ri&s;e from the con&s;equence of their peculiar action on the con&s;ti|tution, and produce &s;pecific cuticular appearances, are u&s;hered in by &s;ome fever, either of the inflammatory, nervous, or putrid kind, in general; yet, &s;hould they he attended, as &s;ometimes they are, with tho&s;e of the mixed cla&s;s, where we cannot perfect|ly di&s;tingui&s;h to which of the more &s;imple &s;ort they belong, we mu&s;t treat them according to the ideas given in the mixed fe|vers.

to the nature of the con&s;titution&mdash;it occa&s;ions a &s;maller quantity of eruptions, and the pu&s;tules to be more &s;uperficial&mdash;hence not leaving tho&s;e deep pit., and often un&s;eemly &s;cars as in the natu|ral &s;mall-pox&mdash;it &s;upplies us with a knowledge of the di&s;ea&s;e at the fir&s;t on&s;et, and enables us to provide again&s;t its con&s;equences&mdash;it empowers us to throw in the matter into the con&s;titution from places far di&s;tant from the vital parts, and prevents the lungs being primarily affected&mdash;and, what is of great con&s;equence, it enables patients to e&s;cape the &s;econdary fever, &s;o fatal to num|bers; for in this artificial &s;ort it rarely attends&mdash;add to this, the operation is &s;o extremely trifling, that it is performed almo&s;t without the &s;lighte&s;t pain, in the following manner:</P>
<P>The &s;carf-&s;kin, of one or both arms, is elevated by a lancet, upon which &s;ome of the infectious matter, taken from a patient labouring under the &s;mall-pox, remains, then pre&s;&s;ing the &s;carf-&s;kin upon the lancet, and with drawing it from under that pre&s;|&s;ure, the variolous matter is left upon the true &s;kin, and taken into the habit by the ab&s;orbent inhaling ve&s;&s;els, which open up|on its &s;urface.</P>
<P>Subjects of every age may be inoculated, even &s;uch as are at the brea&s;t; by &s;ome e&s;teemed the be&s;t time of life; but it &s;hould be before they begin to cut their teeth&mdash;certainly their con&s;titu|tions are at that time in the mo&s;t proper &s;tate&mdash;and, could we be a&s;&s;ured that no accident would occur that might need the aid of medicine, there could not be a moment's he&s;itation re&s;pecting the preference; but, on this account, I &s;hall rather recommend ino|culating at two years old, when complaints could not ari&s;e from teething when the con&s;titution was not in &s;o irritable a &s;tate as to be inconvenienced by &s;light cau&s;es&mdash;and, in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, &s;hould they ari&s;e, the application of medicines would be le&s;s re|&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;ea&s;on, practitioners have differed in that point&mdash;the hot months in &s;ummer I con&s;ider as the mo&s;t excep|tionable, and give the preference to tho&s;e which are the mo&s;t temperate&mdash;the &s;pring, or latter part of autumn, taking care, dur|ing the&s;e periods, to avoid performing the operation when in|flammatory or putrid fevers or other acute complaints were epi|demic, for very obvious rea&s;ons.</P>

<P>In fine, pre&s;erving the con&s;titution in a moderate degree of &s;trength, clearing the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, removing glandular ob&s;truc|tions, making that &s;y&s;tem act with freedom, and loading the ma|chine, as much as may be, with ace&s;cent fluids, &s;eems the mo&s;t rational mode of putting the body into the be&s;t &s;tate.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means, the nervous and va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem will be ena|bled to perform their functions properly, and the humours not become prone to run into an acrimonious or putre&s;cent &s;tate&mdash;hence nature will not meet with any impediment to prevent her from &s;eparating and throwing out the offen&s;ive matter, after it has produced its effects on the ma&s;s of circulating fluids.</P>
<P>It has been thought, and I am of opinion, rightly, that it is immaterial from what &s;ort of &s;mall-pox the inoculating matter is taken, as the different kinds produced depend not upon the nature of the morbid particles, but the con&s;titution into which it is thrown&mdash;for there will be a bad &s;ort ari&s;e from matter that has every mark of mildne&s;s, and a good &s;ort from &s;uch as ap|pears more of a malignant nature; nay, indeed, different people inoculated with the &s;ame matter taken from the &s;ame pu&s;tule, have been known, and that commonly, to have different &s;orts of the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>However, I would always advi&s;e it to be taken from &s;uch &s;ub|jects as labour under the di&s;ea&s;e in its milde&s;t &s;tate, and have the mo&s;t favourable appearing pus&mdash;for it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to take mat|ter from tho&s;e con&s;titutions which, by the appearance of the pocks, be&s;peak the greate&s;t purity, and freedom from any mor|bid taint&mdash;for all people are not agreed upon what the maligni|ty of this complaint depends; and many conclude that other di&s;|orders may be inoculated with the &s;mall-pox&mdash;the&s;e, there|fore, furni&s;h arguments &s;ufficient for great cautions in our elec|tion.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. After the punctures are made in the arms, on the &s;econd day, if the parts are examined by a good magnify|ing gla&s;s, there appears commonly about the puncture an orange-coloured &s;tain, whil&s;t the &s;kin around it &s;eems to contract; but &s;ometimes an inflammation takes place on the &s;econd day, then di&s;appears totally&mdash;this, though, may ari&s;e from irritation from the puncture, trifling as it is; we remain, therefore, doubtful whether or not infection has taken place&mdash;but if it has &s;ucceed|ed, on the fourth or fifth day from the operation, a hardne&s;s and itching, with an apparent inflammation of the part, is percepti|ble; and a kind of bli&s;ter, filled with a tran&s;parent liquid, is ob|&s;ervable.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="028021_0274_0FD6727FB0940130">
On the &s;ixth day, a pain and &s;tiffne&s;s affects the arm-pits.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventh, but <HI>more frequently</HI> upon the eighth, &s;ymp|toms which precede the eruption make their appearance; and the&s;e are commonly &s;uch as &s;hew them&s;elves in general at the commencement of fevers&mdash;cold chills and heat alternate with each other, a &s;light degree of languor, heavine&s;s of the eyes, and &s;light pains in the head and back, are, now and then, perceptible; and the&s;e remain pretty con&s;tant till the &s;mall-pox manife&s;t them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>The inflammation now begins to &s;pread very fa&s;t, and, round the punctured part, a great number of &s;mall eruptions may be &s;een crowding together, which increa&s;e during the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Surrounding the inci&s;ion, and extending it&s;elf half way round the arm, but more commonly de&s;cribing the breadth of a &s;hilling, a circular, or oval, efflore&s;cence is ob&s;ervable. The larger this inflammatory appearance is, which is &s;mooth to the touch, and not painful, the fewer are the general pu&s;tular eruptions&mdash;and, indeed, I have ob&s;erved, when the thread was made u&s;e of, this was the ca&s;e, if the di&s;charge from the inci&s;ion was very copious&mdash;now all the &s;ymptoms cea&s;e, and the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eems to be per|fectly fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>UNFAVOURABLE SYMPTOMS. Though this is the pro|gre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e in general, yet it &s;ometimes happens that there are deviations, and that we have not inflammatory appearances on the wounded arm till the eighth day, then it will &s;uddenly &s;hew it&s;elf, with the other concomitant &s;ymptoms&mdash;this is not recorded as a favourable omen&mdash;&s;till it &s;ometimes is in this point deceptive.</P>
<P>But if the colour around the puncture continues pale, though it is barely perceptible that inoculation has &s;ucceeded, in&s;tead of becoming red or inflamed&mdash;if the edges of the wound &s;pread but little, and remain flat, unattended with itching, or any kind of unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;if, in&s;tead of a red inflammation about the inci&s;ion, it &s;hould have a purpli&s;h ca&s;t; if red, and the circle round the puncture &s;hould be narrow and deep, and the incru&s;tation around it &s;hould be depre&s;&s;ed and concave in the center, they are con&s;i|dered us unfavourable &s;igns.</P>
<P>FAVOURABLE SIGNS. On the other hand, if on the &s;e|cond day there &s;hould be an orange-coloured &s;tain round the in|ci&s;ion&mdash;an itching there in two or three days&mdash;a kind of eleva|tion of the &s;carf-&s;kin, re&s;embling a bli&s;ter, without much inflam|mation, on the third or fourth day&mdash;a pain or &s;tiffne&s;s in the pit of the arm, a large efflore&s;cence round the puncture, on the tenth or eleventh day, or &s;ooner&mdash;a hardne&s;s &s;preading circularly from

the puncture, the inflamed part of the arm elevating it&s;elf, and forming a point, terminating in a dry &s;eal; the&s;e are &s;aid to form very plea&s;ing progno&s;tics, and flatter us with the mo&s;t agreeable expectations of a happy conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The&s;e are &s;imilar to what we have before recited in the &s;mall-pox&mdash;for if the con&s;titution is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e, no effect will be produced, though the vario|lous matter &s;hould be thrown into the habit.</P>
<P>CURE. In the evening after the puncture is made, it hath been thought advi&s;eable to give a few grains of the calomel pow|der, as much as will procure two or three evacuations, purg|ing it off in the morning with &s;ome gentle cathartic. (No. 79, 80.)</P>
<P>Or, in&s;tead of the la&s;t, a do&s;e of Glauber's or Polychre&s;t &s;alt, proportioned to the age and con&s;tiution of the patient&mdash;the&s;e are advi&s;ed to be given every &s;econd morning and evening, till the appearance of the eruption. This is &s;uperfluous, two do&s;es will be in all common ca&s;es &s;ufficient, immediately after the operation, and a day or two before the attack. If the inflammation is &s;light at the puncture, the do&s;e of calomel mu&s;t be increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Afterwards we have nothing to do but to guard again&s;t the febrile &s;ymptoms, which are in general &s;o mild, that there is lit|tle occa&s;ion for medicine.</P>
<P>At the commencement, if nece&s;&s;ary, what has been ju&s;t above pre&s;cribed are advi&s;ed; and repeated two or three times, if the di&s;ea&s;e appears to be of a late or unfavourable &s;ort.</P>
<P>In the intermediate days, &s;hould the fever run high, Clut|ton's febrifuge &s;pirit, or the aethereal &s;pirit of vitriol dropt into any aqueous fluid, &s;o as to make it agreeable, may be taken of|ten in the day.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;ymptoms of the eruptive fever come on, the patients &s;hould continue to be expo&s;ed to the cool air as much as po&s;&s;ible; for it is the be&s;t cordial and corrector of febrile af|fection in this ca&s;e, as I have repeatedly experienced. Indeed, when the febrile &s;ymptoms appear to be violent at the on&s;et, great good has occured from the admini&s;tration of an an|timonial emetic and purgative.</P>
<P>Where the fever appears to be languid, and the patients are of weak and delicate con&s;titutions, &s;ome caution is here nece&s;&s;ary; for the&s;e, perhaps, it will be &s;ufficient to be kept in a large well ventilated room, e&s;pecially if the weather &s;hould be very cold; and they &s;hould be &s;upported on &s;omething of a more cordial and &s;timulating, nature, than if things were otherwi&s;e, and the pati|ents more robu&s;t, who &s;hould be kept, during the eruption, on a mere ace&s;cent diet.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="028021_0276_0FD672846C4C39A8">
After the eruptive &s;tate is over, and the pu&s;tules begin to ma|turate, &s;mall broths, jellies, white wine whey, or &s;uch like ma|terials, may be allowed.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, the weakly and more delicate may require to be kept in bed, and &s;upplied with more cordial appli|cations, in order to perfect the &s;uppuration of the pu&s;tules, and to|tally free the con&s;titution from any remains of the variolous mat|ter.</P>
<P>If we proceed in this prudent manner, adapting our mode to the particular con&s;titution of our patient, we &s;hall very &s;eldom have much trouble; but &s;hould there ari&s;e uncommon complaints now and then in the inoculated &s;mall-pox, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for us to proceed as directed in the natural di&s;ea&s;e, (265, &amp;c.) ob&s;erving whether it verges to the nature of inflammatory ner|vous, putrid, or mixed fever, and conduct our&s;elves con&s;i&s;tent with what the &s;ymptoms point out to our judgement.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; 3. MEAZLES.</HEAD>
<P>Called by the Latins <HI>morbilli,</HI> as being a di&s;ea&s;e of le&s;s con&s;e|quence than the &s;mall-pox; as by <HI>morbillus,</HI> we under&s;tand <HI>mor|bus parvus,</HI> a trifling di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;they have al&s;o been named <HI>rubeo|lae</HI> and <HI>ro&s;eolae,</HI> from the redne&s;s attending the eruption, or put|ting on a colour &s;imilar to ro&s;es&mdash;like the &s;mall-pox, this di&s;ea&s;e appears to be a native of the Ea&s;t, and has certainly a great affi|nity with that complaint, as they are both generally of an in|flammatory nature, equally infectious, and never affect the con|&s;titution twice&mdash;&s;ome authors &s;ay, <HI>except very rarely indeed</HI>&mdash;be|cau&s;e the habit cannot be brought a &s;econd time into &s;uch a &s;tate, as to feel the effects of either of the&s;e infectious particles, &s;o as to reproduce the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;hould they circulate ever &s;o plentifully in the fluids a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>They generally make their appearance in the month of Janu|ary, rage mo&s;t violently about the vernal equinox, and di&s;appear in July.</P>
<P>They commonly attack children; but all con&s;titutions, which have never before felt their influence, are the objects of this in|fection&mdash;hence, in the more advanced &s;tages of life, many with them are afflicted&mdash;they are propagated by the particular con&s;ti|tution of the air, and become highly epidemic.</P>
<P>Some have con&s;idered the attendant fever of the &s;imple inflam|matory &s;ort; others as a catarrhal, or inflammatory remittent; &s;ome &s;ay it is of the peripneumonic kind, and conceive the erup|tion, not as critical, but &s;ymptomatic, as the cough and affections of the lungs will remain after that is over.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="028021_0277_0FD672428CAF2D58">
According to my conception, it is in general a febrile di&s;ea&s;e of the inflammatory kind, always infectious, electively affecting that membrane, called &s;cheiderian, which lines the in&s;ide of the no&s;e, throat, and lungs, and, in its progre&s;&s;ion, the &s;kin&mdash;though I have &s;een the affection of the lungs &s;o extremely &s;light, as not to call forth the lea&s;t attention, where there was a diarrhoea at|tended through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. Its progre&s;s is divided into three &s;tages&mdash;the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> precedes, the <HI>&s;econd</HI> attends, and <HI>the la&s;t</HI> &s;ucceeds the completion of the eruption.</P>
<P>At the commencement there are chillne&s;s and heat alternately &s;ucceeding each other&mdash;&s;oon after, on the &s;econd day, the fever increa&s;es, attended with con&s;iderable &s;ickne&s;s, great heat, thir&s;t, languor, and lo&s;s of appetite&mdash;the tongue is white&mdash;there is a heavine&s;s of the head, and drow&s;ine&s;s&mdash;&s;neezing&mdash;brightne&s;s of the eyes, from whence flow a thin humour&mdash;the eye-lids &s;well, and, <HI>mo&s;t commonly,</HI> there is a dry and very trouble&s;ome cough&mdash;&s;ometimes vomiting and loo&s;ene&s;s are a&s;&s;ociates with the&s;e, the la&s;t of a green colour, when children are getting their teeth&mdash;and all the&s;e &s;ymptoms gradually increa&s;e till the ERUPTIVE, or SECONDARY STAGE begins, which occurs generally on the fourth day; about which time &s;mall red &s;pots, like flea-bites, make their appearance in the face, which run into clu&s;ters, form|ing larger &s;pots, ri&s;ing above the &s;kin, perceptible only to the touch, not the &s;ight; afterwards broad &s;pots &s;pread over the body downwards; not quite &s;o prominent, though of a higher colour than tho&s;e of the face&mdash;when the eruption is fini&s;hed, the vomit|ing cea&s;es, but the fever increa&s;es; and the cough, with the dif|ficulty of breathing, become more violent&mdash;a &s;weat and diar|rhoea now and then &s;upervene.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth day, or thereabout, the THIRD STAGE commenc|es, on which the &s;pots on the face grow dry, and give it a rough appearance; and in three days more they totally di&s;appear from the whole body; for on the ninth day nothing is to be &s;een, ex|cept a dark coloured fine farina, or appearance like bran all over the &s;urface of the &s;kin&mdash;at this period, the fever and cough are &s;ometimes alleviated; &s;ometimes increa&s;ed, and terminate in a dangerous peripneumony&mdash;and not unfrequently a loo&s;ene&s;s &s;uc|ceeds the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>After this we are not to conclude the patient free from dan|ger, unle&s;s, during its cour&s;e, &s;ome con&s;iderable evacuation has taken place, either by &s;weating, vomiting, urine, or loo&s;ene&s;s; for without &s;omething of this kind occurs, the cough will conti|nue, the fever will return with additional violence, and the
<PB N="282" REF="028021_0278_0FD67285C6DAD648">
&s;trength not be recovered except with great commotion in the &s;y&s;tem, and, con&s;equently, extreme danger.</P>
<P>Though what we have de&s;cribed is the mo&s;t frequent mode of the meazles appearance and progre&s;s to their termination, yet &s;ometimes they differ &s;o much, that authors have denominated them ANOMALOUS, or IRREGULAR, as deviating from the com|mon cour&s;e, or as in the eruption putting on the appearance of the &s;mall-pox&mdash;both which we &s;hall de&s;cribe before we proceed to the cure.</P>
<P>The <HI>anomalous</HI> differ from the mild &s;ort, becau&s;e the eruption happens not on the fourth day, but &s;ometimes before, and &s;ome|times after&mdash;the &s;ymptoms preceding, as well as accompanying the eruption, are more &s;evere&mdash;the eruption does not begin &s;o much on the face as on the &s;houlders and trunk of the body&mdash;and becau&s;e it is attended by more dangerous con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;ymptoms which are common in &s;evere fevers, there are &s;ome which are more peculiar to eruptive ones of this &s;ort; for here the pul&s;e is &s;mall and frequent&mdash;re&s;piration is &s;hort and quick&mdash;there is an oppre&s;&s;ion of the hypochondres&mdash;(33. 38.)&mdash;the urine pale&mdash;a great drow&s;ine&s;s&mdash;twitching of the tendons&mdash;&s;pa&s;ms&mdash;delirium, with redne&s;s and watery appearance of the eyes&mdash;load on the eye-lids&mdash;and pricking pain in the &s;kin&mdash;&s;orene&s;s of the throat comes on, with a &s;hrill hoar&s;ene&s;s, and vi|olent cough, in which children appear almo&s;t &s;uffocated, vomit up their food, and grow black in the face&mdash;when, after &s;o &s;evere a &s;truggle, the eruption appears, the fever in part depo&s;its its ma|lignity, the di&s;ea&s;e is at its height; and the fever per&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ame manner to the drying of the &s;pots, which yet, according to SYDENHAM, did not &s;eem to put on that branny appearance as before de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The event of this fever is often dreadful and deadly; for, on the eruption receding, the fever and difficulty of breathing are augmented&mdash;a peripneumony and diarrhoea, occa&s;ioned by the &s;triking in of meazly particles, comes on; which la&s;t is not with|out danger, as happens often in the milder &s;ort, becau&s;e <HI>here</HI> it is acrid, dy&s;enteric, and excruciating&mdash;&s;ometimes a cough, diffi|culty of breathing, and hectic fever &s;ucceed&mdash;at other times, a general drop&s;y, but oftener ob&s;tinate inflammatory affections of the eyes.</P>
<P>The OTHER is &s;aid to be common at PARIS, wherein the erup|tion is different from that of the common regular meazles; for they are more prominent, &s;uppurate perceptibly like the &s;mall-pox, and occa&s;ion the face to &s;well con&s;iderably; but then they are attended with the cough, watery eye, and other affections,

ari&s;ing from defluxions, which chiefly di&s;tingui&s;h them from the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>CAUSES, whether inducing or proximate, are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the &s;mall-pox, (269.) the peculiar particles only creative of the di&s;ea&s;e being altered.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. An infections inflammatory fever for the mo&s;t part, with which are a&s;&s;ociated, a defluxion of a thin watery humour from the eyes, tickling in the no&s;e, &s;neez|ing, dry cough, more or le&s;s violent&mdash;on the fourth day, &s;ome|times &s;ooner, &s;ometimes later though rarely, &s;mall &s;pots running together, perceptible to the touch on the face, but broader on the body not perceptibly elevated above the &s;kin, break forth, which in three days after are converted into branny &s;cales in part, and totally di&s;appear upon the ninth day.</P>
<P>CURE. In &s;o mild a manner will the mea&s;les &s;ometimes af|fect patients, that little is nece&s;&s;ary to be done, except ab&s;tinence from all animal food, or heating applications; and drinking free|ly of thin watery ace&s;cent liquids, &s;uch as common fig drink, made agreeably acid with lemon-juice, apple water, or &s;ome &s;uch like fluids.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the febrile &s;ymptoms run high, we mu&s;t proceed as directed in the &s;mall-pox, (26.)&mdash;but great attention mu&s;t be paid to the affection of the lungs&mdash;oily emul&s;ions and linctures, (No. 81 to 83.) may therefore be pre&s;cribed occa&s;ionally, in con|junction with the other remedies, calculated to keep the febrile affections within proper limits.</P>
<P>Should oily medicines di&s;agree with the &s;tomach, as is &s;ome|times the ca&s;e, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the cla&s;s of demulcents, (187.) (No. 84) u&s;ing the pectoral decoction, or that of lin&s;eed as common drink.</P>
<P>After the eruption is completed, &s;light opiates are &s;erviceable&mdash;but as nature generally performs her cri&s;is either by &s;weats, loo&s;ene&s;s, or urine, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve what way &s;he directs her ef|forts, and proceed as we have before directed in cures of this kind, where they occur in fevers not eruptive.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the redne&s;s of the &s;kin goes off, and the &s;pots begin to die away, gentle purgatives mu&s;t be admini&s;tered, at proper intervals, and the patient return to his u&s;ual mode of life gra|dually, (209.)&mdash;care al&s;o &s;hould be taken, that patients expo&s;e not them&s;elves too early to the cold air, for the&s;e are apt to bring on a very di&s;agreeable cough, a&s;thma, and con&s;umption, from affec|tions of the lungs, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of &s;ome other parts.</P>

This is a di&s;ea&s;e which attacks children about two or three years old, without any remarkable febrile &s;ymptom or indi&s;po&s;ition; it chiefly appears on the face, in &s;mall red pu&s;tules full of a clear or whiti&s;h watery fluid, about the &s;ize of a lentile; &s;ome of which dry off in two days, whil&s;t others increa&s;e; and all fall off in a dry &s;tate within the &s;pace of four, generally leaving no pits in the &s;kin, as they are commonly at|tended with no inconvenience.</P>
<P>There is another variety which frequently affects infants a week old, and pu&s;h forth &s;imilar watery pu&s;tules, about the na|vel, arm-pits, and &s;ingers, which grow dry within three or four days, and fall off in a &s;cab.</P>
<P>The cure left totally to nature is always &s;ufficient; and no|thing more nece&s;&s;ary, than, if it is cold weather, keeping in bed, living upon gruels, weak broths, and warm liquids.</P>

<P>Having had in the cour&s;e of practice &s;o little opportunity of attending the complaint throughout, and when called, there be|ing &s;o little to be done, I confe&s;s it &s;carce ever awakened my ob|&s;ervation, as nature, after the &s;tomach and bowels were cleared, if &s;uch attempts appeared nece&s;&s;ary, always performed the cure. I am happy to have it in my power to &s;upply my readers with an account drawn by the pen of &s;o accurate an ob&s;erver as Dr. HEBERDEN, who &s;ays, in enumerating the</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS, that the pocks in many break out without any previous &s;igns or illne&s;s; in others they are preceded by a &s;light degree of chillne&s;s, la&s;&s;itude, cough, broken &s;leep, wander|ing pains, lo&s;s of appetite, and feveri&s;h for three days&mdash;the pu&s;|tules in mo&s;t of them are the common &s;ize of &s;mall-pox; but &s;ome are le&s;s&mdash;they are never confluent or numerous.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t day of the eruption they are reddi&s;h&mdash;on the &s;e|cond there is at the top of mo&s;t of the pu&s;tules a very &s;mall bladder, about the &s;ize of a millet-&s;eed; this is &s;ometimes full

of a watery and colourle&s;s liquor, &s;ometimes it is yellowi&s;h, con|tained between the cuticle and &s;kin&mdash;on the &s;econd, or at the far|the&s;t, on the third day from the beginning of the eruption, is many of the&s;e pocks as are not ruptured &s;eem arrived at their full maturity, and tho&s;e which are fulle&s;t of that yellow li|quor very much re&s;emble what the genuine &s;mall-pox are on the fifth day.</P>
<P>A thin &s;cab is formed at the top of the pu&s;tule from the cuti|cle being bur&s;t, on the fir&s;t or &s;econd day, which contains this thin fluid, by accident, or, perhaps, from rubbing to allay the itching; the &s;welling of the other parts abates without its being ever turned into pus&mdash;tho&s;e which e&s;cape being bur&s;t, have the little liquor turn yellow and thick, and dries into a &s;cab&mdash;on the fifth day of the eruption they are almo&s;t all dried and covered with a cru&s;t.</P>
<P>The patients &s;uffer little, except &s;ome languor of &s;pirits, &s;trength, and appetite.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e wants no remedies.</P>
<P>It is di&s;tingui&s;hable from the &s;mall-pox by the appearance on the &s;econd or third day, from the eruption full of &s;erum upon the top of the pock.</P>
<P>From the cru&s;t al&s;o, which covers the pock upon the fifth day, at which time the &s;mall-pox is not at the height of its &s;uppuration.</P>
<P>But of this di&s;order there appears a more malignant &s;ort.</P>
<P>For three or four days all the &s;ymptoms which precede the eruption run much higher&mdash;on the fourth or fifth day the erup|tion appears, with very little abatement of the fever&mdash;the pains, likewi&s;e, of the limbs and back continue&mdash;to which are joined pains of the gums&mdash;the pocks are redder than the common chick|enpox, &s;pread wider, and hardly ri&s;e &s;o high, at lea&s;t not in pro|portion to their &s;ize&mdash;in&s;tead of one little head, or vec&s;ile of a &s;erous matter, there have been from four to twelve&mdash;they go off ju&s;t like the chicken-pox, and are di&s;tingui&s;hable from the &s;mall-pox by the &s;ame marks.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the continuance of the pains and fever after the erup|tion, and the degree of both the&s;e, though there be not above twenty pocks, are not ob&s;ervable in the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>From the &s;imilarity of the chicken, or &s;wine, and &s;mall-pox, we may be able to account for the tales we have had of people being affected with the &s;mall-pox twice, or having them after being inoculated, and &s;ucceeding&mdash;for &s;ome may have been ino|culated from the chicken, in&s;tead of the &s;mall-pox&mdash;and this is one of the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons that has induced me to in&s;ert this ac|count, that the error may be avoided&mdash;as very little is nece&s;&s;ary in this ca&s;e to be done by medicine more than what has been be|fore

<HEAD>&sect; 5. SCARLET FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>This takes its name from the &s;carlet coloured efflore&s;cence up|on the &s;kin.</P>
<P>This fever is inflammatory, and attended with different kinds of eruptions; whence it has been divided into two &s;pecies&mdash;one called SIMPLE SCARLET FEVER&mdash;the other, SCARLET NETTLE RASH FEVER, from its eruptions being &s;imilar in appearance to tho&s;e marks left by the &s;tinging of nettles.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. At the commencement the &s;ymp|toms attend which we find in continued fevers, among which there is no great degree of &s;ickne&s;s; but on the fourth day the face &s;wells, the eruption manife&s;ts it&s;elf externally, which are red, more copious, broader, and of a much more florid colour, but not at the &s;ame time &s;o uniform as tho&s;e which at|tend the meazles; but they ari&s;e without any cough or watery eye, which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the meazles; they appear and recede two or three times during the di&s;ea&s;e; be&s;ides, the redne&s;s &s;hews it&s;elf to be uniform, as if the &s;kin was &s;uffu&s;ed with red wine, not breaking in clu&s;ters of pu&s;tules upon the brea&s;t as the meazles do&mdash;in three or four days it entirely cea&s;es&mdash;the &s;carf-&s;kin &s;oon after peels off, and there continues on the &s;urface of the body fine bran-like &s;cales, which are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;upplied for two or three times.</P>
<P>Sometimes eruptions break out on the face and re&s;t of the bo|dy like the &s;tinging of nettles, with much itching, which are ele|vated above the &s;kin, &s;oon increa&s;e, of a pale ro&s;e colour; &s;ome|times with protuberances almo&s;t ery&s;ipelatous, and roughne&s;s like te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ters&mdash;&s;ometimes, on the fever remitting, they di&s;appear; but about the evening &s;hew them&s;elves, with fever, and a trouble|&s;ome hot itching&mdash;and, in three or four days, like the former, entirely cea&s;e, when extremely &s;mall &s;cales &s;eparate from the &s;kin.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The &s;ame may be advanced here as in the mea|zles. (283.)</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. This is an infectious inflam|matory or remittent fever, of &s;hort duration, with a &s;welling of the face on the fourth day, attended with a florid redne&s;s all over

the &s;kin, with broad &s;pots, running at la&s;t together, not elevated above the &s;kin; or with &s;pots like the &s;tinging of nettles, which in three, four, or five days di&s;appear, occa&s;ioning the &s;carf-&s;kin to peel off, and covering the &s;urface of the body with fine bran|ny &s;cales.</P>
<P>CURE. This is of the mo&s;t &s;imple nature&mdash;ab&s;tinence from animal food, keeping out of the cold air, free u&s;e of watery li|quids, thin gruels, and moderate warmth whil&s;t in bed; but &s;hould the &s;ymptoms run very high, and the pul&s;e be very quick, full, and &s;trong, bleeding may be nece&s;&s;ary, once, perhaps, and the u&s;e of &s;aline mixture, (No. 1.) or &s;mall do&s;es of antimo|nials, (180.) or nitrous powders, (No. 2.) keeping the body gent|ly open, by the u&s;e of the milde&s;t aperients, if co&s;tive, (171, 172.) (No. 3. 22 to 24.) and, after the whole is over, and the &s;carf-&s;kin begins to peel off, two or three do&s;es of gentle phy&s;ic &s;hould be given. (172.) (No. 19 to 22.)</P>
<P>But &s;ometimes convul&s;ions, or great drow&s;ine&s;s may come on in the beginning, particularly with infants, a large bli&s;ter may be applied between the &s;houlders, and a quieting draught, &s;imi|lar to No. 4, given every night, agreeable to the age and con&s;ti|tution of the patient&mdash;u&s;ing, for common drink, milk and water, balm tea, in which may be di&s;&s;olved &s;ome gum arabic, and &s;mall portions of nitre.</P>
<P>Doubts have ari&s;en about the exi&s;tence of this fever, Dr. CUL|LEN having never &s;een it in its &s;imple &s;tate&mdash;however, it certain|ly does exi&s;t, and as de&s;cribed by SYDENHAM, of which repeated experience has convinced me; nay, indeed, I have known it &s;eize &s;everal children in the &s;ame family, and mo&s;t generally at the end of &s;ummer.</P>
<P>There is another &s;pecies arranged here by &s;ome authors, &s;tiled the MALIGNANT SCARLET FEVER&mdash;but of that we &s;hall take the opportunity of &s;peaking under the head of Sore Throat, as that is one of its peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;ymptoms, and may probably be derived from that &s;ource.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; 6. MILIARY FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>This receives its name from being attended with eruptions in &s;ize and appearance like <HI>millet &s;eed,</HI> which are &s;ometimes red, at others white&mdash;the fir&s;t filled with a coloured &s;erum; the la&s;t with a tran&s;parent fluid, called lymph, accompanied with &s;carce any redne&s;s at all.</P>
<P>Though the exi&s;tence of this fever has been doubted by many, &s;till, it is generally now allowed, that there is a fever of this pe|culiar kind, originating from &s;pecific infectious particles getting
<PB N="289" REF="028021_0285_0FD6724848084258">
into the blood, and producing its effects upon the machine&mdash;yet it may, and often does ari&s;e from the injudicious management of other fevers, by treating them with too heating a regimen&mdash;hence it is con&s;idered al&s;o &s;ymptomatic, and often joined with the &s;mall-pox, meazles, and other fevers.</P>
<P>Like &s;ome other of the eruptive cla&s;s, this is &s;imple and com|plicated.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. At the commencement there is a chillne&s;s &s;ucceeded by no extraordinary heat&mdash;the fever is mild, attended by an unea&s;y and copious &s;weating&mdash;there is no general pain, but the head appears &s;lightly affected&mdash;no thir&s;t&mdash;the appetite conti|nues&mdash;the pul&s;e depre&s;&s;ed, and rather hard&mdash;and the urine appears healthful.</P>
<P>The patient &s;oon after, on the &s;econd day, begins to be fearful and apprehen&s;ive, <HI>con&s;tantly &s;ighing, from a &s;en&s;e of weight and tightne&s;s at the pit of the &s;tomach</HI>&mdash;has unea&s;y dreams&mdash;<HI>dejection of &s;pirits&mdash;the head confu&s;ed</HI>&mdash;his &s;weats perpetually &s;mell &s;our&mdash;there are a variety of &s;udden and involuntary motions, and <HI>con|&s;tant re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s</HI>&mdash;the pul&s;e is <HI>&s;maller,</HI> and increa&s;ed in <HI>quickne&s;s</HI>&mdash;and there is a certain &s;en&s;ation of tingling numbne&s;s in the fingers&mdash;and the urine pale and limpid.</P>
<P>On the third or fourth day, &s;eldom later, red or white erup|tions break out on the neck, brea&s;t, and back, &s;eldom on the face, preceded by pricking pains, &s;ometimes itching&mdash;at this period chillne&s;s and heat &s;ucceed each other repeatedly, and the &s;weat|ing becomes profu&s;e&mdash;from thence, for about the &s;pace of thirty hours, eruptions continue to come out, which are filled with a thin &s;erous fluid, having round their ba&s;e an inflammatory ap|pearance. The &s;ymptoms now begin to be alleviated&mdash;the &s;weat|ing continues, though not &s;o profu&s;ely&mdash;the mind begins to be le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed&mdash;the urine puts on a higher colour&mdash;the pul&s;e be|comes more &s;oft and regular&mdash;and about the &s;eventh day the pu&s;|tules for the mo&s;t part grow dry, the &s;carf-&s;kin peeling off in &s;cales.</P>
<P>This is a pretty accurate de&s;cription of the mild &s;pecies of this fever, in which we may expect the eruptions will very &s;oon make their appearance, when there are an uncommon dejection of &s;pirits, watchings, confu&s;ion of the head, much oppre&s;&s;ion on the brea&s;t, with a weak quick pul&s;e; for the&s;e are con&s;idered as the certain &s;ymptoms of their near approach.</P>
<P>CAUSES. Both the inducing and immediate are &s;imilar to what we have delivered when &s;peaking of the meazles. (283.)</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. A mixed fever, attended with anxiety&mdash;dejection of &s;pirits&mdash;frequent involuntary &s;ighing&mdash;&s;trong &s;melling &s;weats&mdash;and pricking of the &s;kin&mdash;&s;mall di&s;tinct
<PB N="290" REF="028021_0286_0FD67193BB767150">
&s;pots, for the mo&s;t part of a red colour, breaking out mo&s;t fre|quently on the third or fourth day on the neck, brea&s;t, and back, &s;eldom on the face, who&s;e tops re&s;emble, after one or two days, very minute pu&s;tules, which continue only for a &s;hort &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>CURE. The indications of cure are the &s;ame as in other erup|tive fevers.</P>
<P>Now this fever mu&s;t in this place be con&s;idered of a mixed nature, (240.) verging rather more to the nervous than inflam|matory cla&s;s&mdash;however, if they attack tho&s;e of &s;trong, robu&s;t, full habits, and there &s;hould be a great degree of va&s;cular action, bleeding may, perhaps, be nece&s;&s;ary, but that rarely&mdash;we &s;hould rather proceed as we have directed when &s;peaking of the &s;imple continued fever, to the u&s;e of &s;aline mixtures, with &s;mall do&s;es of antimonials, (181.) (No. 6 to 9.) from whence, if the &s;tomach &s;hould be &s;oul, a vomiting will en&s;ue; this will abate the &s;ick|ne&s;s, take off the oppre&s;&s;ion, produce a gentle per&s;piration, deter|mine the morbid matter to the &s;kin, moderate the febrile &s;ymp|toms, and occa&s;ion, though not a le&s;s copious, a more expediti|ous eruption&mdash;and before <HI>that,</HI> cooling purgatives are beneficial, though not afterwards. (171, 172.) (No. 3. 22 to 24.)</P>
<P>Bleeding, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, is only admi&s;&s;ible in <HI>the fir&s;t &s;tage</HI> of this di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;afterwards it is &s;o far from being of any u&s;e, that convul&s;ions and death it&s;elf are often the fatal con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>Cooling acids may be al&s;o allowed in the beginning; but when the eruption has appeared they are prejudicial&mdash;diluting, emol|lient, and ace&s;cent liquids may be u&s;ed&mdash;and from fomenting the feet and legs with tepid fomentations, great advantages have been derived.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the con&s;titution be different from what we have &s;pecified, that is, rather debilitated than languid, and the ner|vous &s;y&s;tem appear to be in too inactive a &s;tate, we mu&s;t apply to &s;uch things as are of more cordial nature, to &s;upport and in|vigorate the con&s;titution; but out of them we mu&s;t &s;elect tho&s;e of the milder &s;pecies; for, by &s;timulating the habit too violent|ly, we &s;hould prevent the &s;eparation and expul&s;ion of the morbid matter, and be in&s;trumental in occa&s;ioning it to fall upon &s;ome of the nobler parts internally.</P>
<P>Hence, then, &s;uch cordial volatile medicines as we have de&s;|cribed in the nervous fever, or &s;ome things &s;imilar, &s;hould be admini&s;tered&mdash;and wine and water, or white wine whey may be allowed to be drank occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P>Bli&s;ters &s;hould al&s;o be applied; and as &s;oon as one has cea&s;ed to di&s;charge, another mu&s;t be laid on, becau&s;e it is ob&s;ervable
<PB N="291" REF="028021_0287_0FD6724E110ADE88">
that the evacuation produced by them, as well as keeping up the &s;timulus, affords great relief; for, on the evacuation cea&s;|ing, all things wear a more favourable a&s;pect, which are al|ways altered for the better, on the reproduction of the di&s;|charge.</P>
<P>But &s;ometimes, in&s;tead of the convul&s;ive &s;ymptoms being mitigated after the eruption, they increa&s;e, attended with &s;uch a train of &s;ymptoms as are indicative of greater degree of dan|ger.</P>
<P>For the febrile affections grow more violent, increa&s;ing about mid-day and at night&mdash;the &s;leep is di&s;turbed with dreadful dreams&mdash;the &s;weating decrea&s;es&mdash;the &s;kin is hot and inflamed&mdash;the head is affected with pain, producing the &s;en&s;ation of inward di&s;ten&s;ion&mdash;the face appears fuller&mdash;the tongue is dry and white&mdash;the pul&s;e &s;mall and quick&mdash;and the urine copious, thin, and wate|ry.</P>
<P>On the third day of the eruption there appears a great aug|mentation of violence throughout&mdash;the heat is burning&mdash;the pu&s;|tules &s;ub&s;ide&mdash;the &s;weat cea&s;es&mdash;the &s;kin becomes rough&mdash;the tendons &s;tart&mdash;the patients are extremely re&s;tle&s;s, forward, and loquacious&mdash;they grow delirious, and are convul&s;ed&mdash;they be|come thir&s;ty&mdash;the pul&s;e is hard and quick&mdash;and the urine copi|ous, and like water.</P>
<P>The belly, which before was co&s;tive, is now the rever&s;e, eva|cuating foetid bilious &s;tools&mdash;&s;hould any &s;weat return, this vio|lence on the pu&s;tules breaking out again is mitigated&mdash;and on the &s;ucceeding day the eruptions become more copious and lar|ger, the former beginning now to dry&mdash;notwith&s;tanding which, about the third day the &s;econd crop creates new and &s;imilar di&s;|tre&s;s, though in a milder degree than the former&mdash;a third and fourth crop will &s;ucceed, until the la&s;t &s;tage of declen&s;ion, &s;imi|lar to what occurs in the milder &s;pecies.&mdash;Still in this &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e there is a bilious foetid loo&s;ene&s;s, with rolling of wind in the bowels, which continues&mdash;the urine &s;ometimes feels hot, and appears like milk whey without any &s;ediment.</P>
<P>Patients afflicted with this fever &s;eldom recover before the fif|teenth or twenty-fir&s;t day.</P>
<P>This fever has been by &s;ome con&s;idered of the inflammatory cla&s;s; by others it has been called the acute malignant&mdash;but it appears to be truly of the mixed kind, and might properly be looked upon as a <HI>malignant miliary mixed</HI> fever.</P>
<P>Sometimes the progre&s;s of this fever is &s;lower, and longer con|tinued, the pu&s;tules not &s;triking out with a proper redne&s;s, but &s;inking down in the &s;kin or retroceding inwardly, liable to return at &s;ome other time, and occa&s;ioning a &s;low recovery; and &s;ome|times
<PB N="292" REF="028021_0288_0FD6719589506E10">
death; but its progre&s;s is different in &s;ome degree.</P>
<P>This fever is apt to &s;eize the delicate and relaxed, who have a thin and acrimonious &s;tate of fluids.</P>
<P>In addition to the pu&s;tular appearance above &s;pecified, the ten|dons &s;tart continually&mdash;a delirium and convul&s;ions come on&mdash;the head-ach, though con&s;iderable, is not very acute&mdash;the tongue trembles&mdash;the velocity of the pul&s;e is not &s;o great in the erup|tive &s;tage; but the freedom and quickne&s;s are irregular; &s;ome|times it almo&s;t intermits&mdash;the urine is various, &s;ometimes thin or higher coloured, but oftener turbid and &s;mall in quantity&mdash;but a vi&s;cid &s;weat breaking out which is foetid, having for its a&s;&s;ociate &s;ome larger ve&s;icular eruptions, and pu&s;tules of &s;ize more con&s;iderable, putting on an appearance almo&s;t &s;imilar to the &s;mall-pox, alleviate the&s;e &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>After this &s;tage, now and then the patients become extreme|ly drow&s;y, and have continual twitchings of the tendons, and convul&s;ive eructations, then become &s;tupid, forgetful, and fall into a &s;tate of lethargy; to which &s;ucceed convul&s;ions, which are followed &s;lowly by &s;noring and death.</P>
<P>This fever, &s;hould the patient recover, is apt to return about the &s;ame time in the &s;ucceeding year, and often &s;eizes women during their lying-in&mdash;whence there is a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion both of their milk and tho&s;e di&s;charges after child-birth, called lo|chia.</P>
<P>The milde&s;t &s;ort of the miliary fever generally terminates in &s;even, the malignant mixed in fourteen, and this in about twen|ty-one days.</P>
<P>There can be little doubt of the nature of this fever, if we pay attention to the &s;ymptoms, for they be&s;peak it truly nervous&mdash;hence, for the cure, we mu&s;t refer to what we have &s;aid on the nervous fever, (216.) making, perhaps, a freer u&s;e of bli&s;ters, and ob&s;erving a quicker &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, for the rea&s;ons advanced; (290.)</P>
<P>Sometimes, added to the miliary eruptions, &s;uch a train of &s;ymptoms will attend, as clearly to &s;hew its di&s;po&s;ition to be of the putrid kind; little deviating from what we have recited when &s;peaking of putrid fever, (221, &amp;c.) and con&s;equently will require &s;imilar applications&mdash;but &s;till, though much cannot be expected from bli&s;ters in &s;ymptoms &s;imply putre&s;cent; yet &s;uch is the alleviation they bring in miliary eruption, that to neglect them would be an error of no trifling con&s;equence&mdash;and, if to the&s;e we add the u&s;e of bark, mineral acids, and wine, little more can be expected to be done in this fever, as the&s;e are the prin|cipal materials from whence we can expect any con&s;iderable &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>

<P><HI>Drops of blood from the no&s;e</HI> at any time be&s;peak great danger; and, when drawn, if it &s;hould be of a &s;carlet colour continually without &s;erum, it is a bad &s;ign.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; 7. ERYSIPELAS, or SEROUS INFLAMMATORY FEVER, com|monly called SAINT ANTHONY'S FIRE.</HEAD>
<P>This is con&s;idered as an inflammation of the &s;kin, and &s;ubja|cent fat, attended with an inflammatory fever, originating from an acrimonious humour and inflamed &s;tate of the thinner part of the blood, from which nature endeavours to free her&s;elf by ex|pelling the morbid portion from the habit, and depo&s;iting it on &s;ome external part, chiefly the &s;kin, in broad red &s;pots, which creep from place to place&mdash;hence its name, from the Greek words <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ruo,</HI> to draw, and <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">las,</HI> into the vicinity.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. It generally commences with chillne&s;s and &s;hivering, which in a day or two are &s;ucceeded by a violent &s;ud|den redne&s;s, and pain, attacking &s;ome part or other, chiefly the face; and has for its a&s;&s;ociates an acrid heat, ro&s;y-coloured efflo|re&s;cences, with great tightne&s;s of the &s;kin, &s;lightly &s;welled, which is broad and diffu&s;ed, not circum&s;cribed&mdash;the febrile affections increa&s;e, with heat, anxiety, thir&s;t, often al&s;o a white tongue and &s;trong breath.</P>
<P>But it is often attended with greater degrees of violence&mdash;<HI>then</HI> it begins with great &s;hiverings, &s;ucceeded by a burning heat, a|cute head-ach, retching and vomiting, till the ery&s;ipelas appears, which is &s;ometimes deferred to the &s;econd or third day; when the febrile &s;ymptoms are alleviated, and the &s;ickne&s;s cea&s;es, tho', not unfrequently, they continue in a &s;lighter degree to the height&mdash;&s;ometimes, when the di&s;ea&s;e runs high, the fever continues,
<PB N="295" REF="028021_0291_0FD67252B2388D58">
the brain is oppre&s;&s;ed, delirium comes on, and matters wear an unpromi&s;ing a&s;pect.</P>
<P>Upon the tumid part ve&s;icles ari&s;e, and run along the forehead hairy &s;calp, eye-lids, neck, forming a circle round them, which, if injudiciou&s;ly treated, become gangrenous, and creates delirium&mdash;&s;ometimes the humour filling the pu&s;tules, and i&s;&s;uing from thence, in&s;tead of being thin and &s;erous, is thick and gluey, and forms a thick &s;curf or cru&s;t, continuing fixed before they fall off, for many days.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e frequently terminates in &s;even days; but &s;ome|times it will proceed in a &s;imilar manner for eight, ten, or twelve days, and at la&s;t go off by a copious &s;weat, of which re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, with concomitant &s;hivering, and &s;ome anxiety, though not much, for a &s;mall &s;pace of time, will be &s;ometimes the forerunners; and from thence may the critical effort be progno&s;ticated. During the progre&s;s of this complaint, the whole &s;kin and in&s;ide of the mouth is very dry.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing</HI> are &s;aid to be, violent men|tal affection, particularly anger and fear&mdash;a &s;udden cooling of the body, heated before by the &s;trong power of the &s;un&mdash;drinking of, or bathing in, too cold water&mdash;a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the natural or artificial evacuations&mdash;moi&s;t and rainy &s;ea&s;ons&mdash;and, in fine, whatever occa&s;ions the ob&s;truction of per&s;piration.</P>
<P>The <HI>proximate</HI> or <HI>immediate,</HI> acrimonious and heating particles derived from humours that are contaminated and retained, which ought to be thrown out of the habit.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. An inflammatory fever, for the mo&s;t part, of a few days continuance, with a &s;uperficial, &s;oli|tary, diffu&s;ive &s;welling, of a red ro&s;e colour, going off upon pre&s;|&s;ure, and returning; of an uniform &s;moothne&s;s, unle&s;s made rough by eruptions; and is attended with an acrid burning, or itching heat.</P>
<P>CURE. As this di&s;ea&s;e, though neither infections nor conta|gious, evidently ari&s;es from &s;ome acrid humours ejected out of the ma&s;s of fluids, and collected in the cuticular ve&s;&s;els, through which it ought to e&s;cape out of the habit, we mu&s;t be very cau|tious not to lower the fever too much by exce&s;&s;ive evacuations; nor hinder the exit, or cau&s;e the retroce&s;&s;ion when di&s;charged up|on the &s;kin by the injudicious admini&s;tration of cold or a&s;tringent applications; for the indications of cure are, &s;o to regulate the moving powers, as to enable them to throw the offen&s;ive matter out of the con&s;titution, and prevent any retroce&s;&s;ion on the inter|nal and vital parts.</P>
<P>Hence, therefore, mu&s;t we proceed, as in other ca&s;es, con&s;i&s;t|ently with the &s;trength of the habit. If it attacks tho&s;e of &s;trong
<PB N="296" REF="028021_0292_0FD671A04CA84BA0">
full con&s;titutions, we bleed in proportion to the &s;trength, and give the cooling cathartics, &s;uch as purge off the &s;erous humours in the mo&s;t certain and ea&s;ie&s;t mode, as vitriolated natron, ace|tated tartar, Polychre&s;t &s;alt, Ep&s;om &s;alt, manna, tamarinds, cry|&s;tals of tartar, jalap, &amp;c. (171, 172.) (No. 1. 22 to 24.) and, on the intermediate days, we &s;hould give at intervals antimonials joined with nitre, acetated tartar, or the &s;aline mixture; to which gentle aperients may be added, if nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Emetics in this ca&s;e have been found efficacious&mdash;mu&s;tard poultices applied to the feet, and bathing the legs and feet in warm water are very beneficial, where the head and face are af|fected&mdash;and, under this circum&s;tance, bleeding and purging may be repeated, till an alleviation of the &s;ymptoms are produced.</P>
<P>In all our endeavous we &s;hould attempt to promote gentle e|vacuation by the &s;kin with cooling diaphoretics.</P>
<P>There have been different opinions with re&s;pect to local appli|cations to the part affected; &s;ome advi&s;e mild and &s;oftening ap|plications to the part affected, as fre&s;h cream, the ointment of elder leaves, tepid watery fomentations, or the u&s;e of the water of acetated litharge&mdash;however, the fine powder of fenugreek, or wheat flour, &s;prinkled upon the part, and lying in bed&mdash;or, if a fluid begins to ooze out of the ve&s;icles, chalk or &s;tarch may be &s;prinkled on a &s;oft cloth, and thus applied; for all repellents, whether of an aqueous or oily nature, are hurtful.</P>
<P>Should the &s;welling be &s;uddenly depre&s;&s;ed, from a retroce&s;&s;ion of the offen&s;ive matter, attended with internal oppre&s;&s;ion and anx|iety, and at the &s;ame time the pul&s;e becomes weak and &s;inks, we mu&s;t immediately apply bli&s;ters, and have recour&s;e to vinous and other cordials; wine may be exhibited freely, volatile and other &s;timulants, which have more permanent action, &s;uch as the nature of the circum&s;tances require.</P>
<P>Sometimes this di&s;ea&s;e attacks the trunk, che&s;t, &s;houlder-blades, or &s;ides, and frequently makes its appearance lower, encircling the middle of the body, like a belt&mdash;hence called by the Greeks ZOSTER and ZONA, a belt; and by the Engli&s;h SHINGLES, from the Latin word <HI>cingulum,</HI> a girdle.</P>
<P>In this complaint little yellowi&s;h pimples, but more frequent|ly of a livid hue, ari&s;e which are went to corrode, like a tetter, which &s;pecies they re&s;emble.</P>
<P>The fever which is the a&s;&s;ociate of this eruption is only &s;light; but, &s;hould the pimples be pu&s;hed back, &s;ymptoms of greater con|&s;equence pre&s;ent them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There have been in&s;tances where the ery&s;ipelas has begun with &s;hivering, heat, delirium, violent pain of the back, head, and o|ther parts of the body, where there was no inflammation; but
<PB N="297" REF="028021_0293_0FD6725685718A18">
upon the third or fourth day, the hot burning humour was de|po&s;ited in the glands under the arms, or in the groin, and there formed ab&s;ce&s;&s;es; or de&s;cended into the feet, and brought on mor|tification; and from a retroce&s;&s;ion of the morbid matter, life was in the mo&s;t extreme danger.</P>
<P>For if this matter cannot be made to re-appear, the peccant humour is depo&s;ited upon the brain or brea&s;t, and death is &s;hort|ly the con&s;equence&mdash;if the depo&s;ition happens upon the brain, delirium immediately &s;ucceeds, the vi&s;age is flu&s;hed, the eyes &s;parkle very quick, then follows madne&s;s, terminating fatally in lethargy; but &s;hould it be upon the lungs, the heat and anxiety is intolerable, of which no words are adequate to convey a per|fect idea.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e appearances, our modes of cure vary not from that which we have before de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Though, in general, the ery&s;ipelas very &s;eldom comes to &s;uppuration, &s;till, when that is the ca&s;e, it does not maturate kindly, and frequently forms di&s;agreeable and ill-conditioned ul|cers.</P>
<P>Sometimes a mortification will threaten, then mu&s;t we apply &s;uch things as are calculated to &s;top its progre&s;s, as decoction of bark, lime-water mixed with camphor and &s;pirits of wine, or camphorated &s;pirits of wine, with tincture of myrrh.</P>
<P>In the &s;lighter kinds of ery&s;ipelas there is no great danger; but if a violent inflammation, attended with &s;tupor, drow&s;ine&s;s, or delirium, &s;hould &s;eize patients with an acrimonious &s;tate of fluids, much are the con&s;equences to be dreaded.</P>
<P>Should the inflammation recede or be repelled, it brings on delirium, internal inflammations, a&s;thma, convul&s;ions and morti|fication; or &s;hould the tumid part grow livid, we may conclude the latter of the&s;e affections at hand. With re&s;pect to the pu&s;|tules, the thicker and whiter the matter, the le&s;s will be the de|gree of danger; but &s;hould it be thin and pale, &s;o much more in proportion will it be increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>The PLAGUE, and that fever called PEMPHIGUS, from the Greek word <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mphix,</HI> bulla, a bubble or ve&s;icle, or BULLOUS OR VESICULARY FEVER, &s;hould be next treated on; but as I have had no experience in the former, I &s;hall proceed to &s;peak on the latter only as far as it has fallen under my ob&s;ervation, as the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf &s;eems not to be perfectly &s;ettled by authors.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. ON INFLAMMATION.</HEAD>
<P>IN a former &s;ection we have &s;poken of inflammatory fever, (201.) which we have &s;aid depended upon a peculiar &s;tate of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem and blood, the moving powers, or part of them, put into too &s;trong motion, and &s;upported in the violence of their action by the peculiarity of that &s;tate: here the affections were general, produced not by, or dependent upon, any other di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>But in this place we are to treat of local affections, having a fever for their a&s;&s;ociate; hence it is to be con&s;idered, not as a primary, but as a &s;econdary di&s;ea&s;e, produced by, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> dependent on, &s;ome other; con&s;equently only a &s;ign that &s;ome other mala|dy reigns in the habit&mdash;the fir&s;t of the&s;e fevers is called IDIOPA|THIC, the &s;econd SYMPTOMATIC.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="028021_0295_0FD67257F8015378">
Now, in inflammation there are &s;ome particulars ob&s;ervable, which, on examination, will lead us to the cau&s;e, and enable us to lay down certain rules for the cure.</P>
<P>In a part under a &s;tate of inflammation there are <HI>more than na|tural heat, redne&s;s, ten&s;ion, pain,</HI> and <HI>&s;welling.</HI></P>
<P>The FIRST is produced by the blood circulating to the part with more than u&s;ual force, and being there collected in too great quantity; and wherever that is the ca&s;e, there is a proportionate increa&s;e of warmth&mdash;the SECOND is owing to the blood being pu&s;hed into tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, which, in an healthful &s;tate, are only permitted to carry the &s;erous or thinner fluids &s;trained from the &s;anguinary ma&s;s&mdash;the THIRD ari&s;es from a too great quantity of fluids crowding into the containing ve&s;&s;els, by which they are di&s;tended, and their fibres di&s;tracted, which produces the FOURTH, or PAIN&mdash;and the FIFTH deduces its origin from the di&s;ten&s;ion, and the fluids being too freely pu&s;hed into the cellular membrane; or exuding through the coats of the ve&s;&s;el, by their natural parts being too permeable, from the &s;uperabundant quantity of liquids they contain.</P>
<P>Now all the&s;e effects may be produced by <HI>&s;timulus</HI> of &s;ome nature applied to the parts affected, increa&s;ing the action of the ve&s;&s;els, which &s;olicits the fluids to the&s;e parts too rapidly, and produces <HI>di&s;ten&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it appears obvious, that the&s;e two cau&s;es are adequate to create the&s;e effects&mdash;one of which acting will occa&s;ion only a &s;light degree of inflammation, of no long continuance&mdash;but if they both are conjoined, then ari&s;es an inflammatory di&s;ea&s;e of greater violence and duration; ina&s;much as, from the&s;e two cau&s;es co-operating, the effects produced will be more vehement.</P>
<P>But in the parts which are mo&s;t &s;olid, or in which the ve&s;&s;els continue their cour&s;e in a &s;traight direction, &s;hould any inflam|mation ari&s;e, <HI>there</HI> will con&s;equently be greater degree of pain, than if it happens in the &s;ofter vi&s;cera, or glandular parts; be|cau&s;e there is always a higher degree of ten&s;ion in the ve&s;&s;els&mdash;hence in firm membranous parts, the &s;kin, ligaments, tendons, cartilages, and bones, (21, 22. 24.) inflammations are found more acutely painful, whil&s;t in the &s;ofter parts before-mentioned, the pain is &s;ometimes &s;light, and always inferior to that of the other.</P>
<P>But external accidents will, by producing the two cau&s;es a&s;|&s;igned, (298.) create local inflammatory &s;ymptoms, whil&s;t the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem in general &s;hall perceive no di&s;turbance, which will not at all be indicated by the pul&s;e, or other febrile affecti|ons; &s;o that if a fever &s;hould ari&s;e, as it generally does in all con&s;iderable inflammations, it is to be con&s;idered as owing its ori|gin
<PB N="300" REF="028021_0296_0FD671A05710D0D0">
to this cau&s;e, and is a con&s;equence, therefore only e&s;teemed a &s;ymptoms; for exce&s;&s;ive heat, thir&s;t, and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, are conco|mitants of va&s;cular affection, and generally attend inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, independent of any fever, except what they them&s;elves create; whil&s;t weakne&s;s and lo&s;s of appetite, e&s;&s;ential &s;ymptoms attendant on primary or idiopathic (298.) fevers of any continu|ance, are wanting, and &s;eem to belong to affections of the ner|vous &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>But &s;ome inflammations owe their origin to fever, and may be occa&s;ioned by peculiar cau&s;es; either from the elective power of morbid matter thrown into the habit, that is, a predeliction for fixing on &s;ome peculiar part or parts in preference to others, as in the &s;mall-pox, meazles, gout, rheumati&s;m, &amp;c. or from lo|cal con&s;titutional imperfection&mdash;hence we find, different parts may become the &s;eat of inflammation from general cau&s;es al&s;o; for if the re&s;i&s;tance of any part is &s;upernaturally increa&s;ed, and a &s;timulus &s;hould be applied to them from acrid humours circu|lating in the ma&s;s of fluids, and fixing there, an inflammation will be the unavoidable con&s;equence&mdash;and the&s;e very often terminate fatally, &s;hould it in fevers fix in &s;ome of the nobler parts; and to the&s;e is often to be attributed in many fevers the death of the patient.</P>
<P>If we reflect on the cau&s;e of inflammation, we &s;hall find, that every part of the human machine, which is plentifully &s;upplied with blood ve&s;&s;els interwoven in their texture, is &s;ubject to this affection&mdash;and <HI>mo&s;tly &s;o</HI> are tho&s;e parts which are liable to be ex|po&s;ed to external injuries; or to &s;timulating materials, which circulate and are buoyed up in the atmo&s;phere; though &s;ome of the very thin membranes, the &s;carf-&s;kin, hair, and nails, may be con&s;idered as exceptions.</P>
<P>Hence, according to the con&s;equence of the part affected, will be the di&s;turbance of the con&s;titution, and the degree of danger; and the&s;e will manife&s;t them&s;elves according as the u&s;e of tho&s;e parts is mo&s;t immediately connected with tho&s;e actions of the con&s;titution on which life is immediately dependent, by which the machine is nouri&s;hed, and its parts kept in proper order, and from whence it has its power of motion, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the terms <HI>vital, natural,</HI> and <HI>animal</HI>&mdash;upon all which, acting in uni|&s;on, is con&s;tituted the welfare of that machine.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the termination of inflammation, there are five modes, RESOLUTION, EXUDATION, SUPPURATION, MORTIFICA|TION, and SCIRRHUS.</P>
<P>Inflammation is con&s;idered to terminate in RESOLUTION when, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the flow of blood is diverted from the part affected, the violence of va&s;cular action allayed, and &s;trength giv|en

to the coats of the ve&s;&s;els, &s;o that they may be properly &s;up|ported, and the di&s;&s;ipation of the load of fluids which have been collected be procured; or they may be re&s;orbed into the habit&mdash;by EXUDATION, which occurs only in &s;uperficial inflammations on the &s;kin, and membranes lining internal cavities or pa&s;&s;ages, or covering the different vi&s;cera, when di&s;ten&s;ion of the arteries, and an enlargement of the pores of their &s;ides takes place, by the rapidity of motion producing more than u&s;ual force on the ve&s;&s;els in an inflammatory &s;tate, occa&s;ioning great increa&s;e of heat, and expan&s;ion of the contained fluids.</P>
<P>In this manner frequently ends ery&s;ipelas, by pu&s;hing forth little pu&s;tules or bli&s;ters, and freeing the ve&s;&s;els which are in|flamed&mdash;&s;o al&s;o in burns and wounds matter exudes, which is termed dige&s;tion; and as this comes on and continues, &s;o are the parts affected alleviated, and totally cured. Nature al&s;o makes u&s;e of this expedient in catarrhal and other &s;lightly inflammatory complaints of the lungs, as well as in the gonorrhoea virulenta, or clap; for all the&s;e are &s;uperficial inflammations&mdash;by ABSCESS, or SUPPURATION, when neither of the&s;e proce&s;&s;es takes place, but the violence of motion continues or increa&s;es, and the weakne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els &s;till remains; then the fluids which have been col|lected in the cellular membrane are either too copious, or become &s;o thick and vi&s;cid, that they cannot be ab&s;orbed and received back into the circulating fluids, nor pu&s;hed out, and thus evacu|ated through the pores of the &s;kin&mdash;among&s;t the&s;e another pro|ce&s;s takes place, termed FERMENTATION, wherein the ve&s;&s;els, cellular membrane, and mu&s;cular fibres are melted down, and a white thick matter is formed, called pus; but this happens chiefly in more deep &s;eated inflammations in &s;ome vi&s;cous, fle&s;hy, or glandular parts&mdash;by MORTIFICATION, when the force of cir|culation is &s;o violent again&s;t the &s;ides of the inflamed ve&s;&s;els, that the coats are ruptured; or when the arterial coats are &s;o very weak, that the blood bur&s;ting into the cavities of the cellular membrane there &s;tagnates, and quickly corrupts, forming what is called in medical language GANGRENE, or SPHACELUS; the fir&s;t con&s;idered by &s;ome as mortification in its incipient &s;tate, the la&s;t when it is perfectly formed; but others, when the &s;kin and cellular membranes are the parts affected, give it the former name; when the mu&s;cular, the latter; when the bones, it is called CA|RIES; &s;o, in fact, they are all truly mortifications, though only of different parts.</P>
<P>When mortification takes place, there is a ce&s;&s;ation in the part of all pain, from the de&s;truction of the living &s;olids; hence the protru&s;ion of blood, which becomes of a darker colour than be|fore, or has a livid appearance, hence its &s;tagnation and corrup|tion
<PB N="302" REF="028021_0298_0FD672BB01038968">
and deprivation of its natural colour&mdash;after this, a &s;ponta|neous &s;eparation of the parts which compo&s;e it takes place, the thinner part is driven forwards towards the &s;urface, and elevates the cuticle into bli&s;ters.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, we may form a judgment why mor|tifications are mo&s;t likely to occur in tho&s;e who&s;e fluids are in an acrid &s;tate, old people, and tho&s;e of drop&s;ical habit; becau&s;e the &s;olids are &s;oon broken down, and many &s;light accidents are &s;uffi|cient to produce the&s;e dangerous, and often fatal effects, which we at fir&s;t ob&s;erve with an un&s;u&s;picious eye, when they are at|tacked by inflammations of &s;ome force; for, indeed, in con&s;titu|tions not labouring under the&s;e defects they rarely happen.</P>
<P>The la&s;t termination we &s;hall mention is, SCIRRHUS, here con|&s;idered as a hard indolent tumour only, and chiefly pre&s;ents it&s;elf in the &s;pongy vi&s;cera, as the lungs, me&s;entery, womb, and par|ticularly the glands in various parts of the machine.</P>
<P>And this generally ari&s;es from the circulation in the glands, generally being too languid&mdash;hence are ob&s;tructions formed from the fluids in&s;pi&s;&s;ating within the &s;mall capillary, or hair like tubes, and only producing va&s;cular di&s;ten&s;ion &s;o gradually, that there is no great exce&s;s of pain, nor any violent increa&s;e of heat, &s;o that proper power is wanting to create that proce&s;s which in|duces &s;uppuration, and al&s;o force &s;ufficient to break down the ve&s;&s;els, and produce mortification, which in the&s;e parts are &s;aid &s;eldom to take place, except from acrimony of the &s;harpe&s;t na|ture pouring down on the ve&s;&s;els of any particular gland, and being there depo&s;ited.</P>
<P>Inflammation then may be con&s;idered only as one cau&s;e of &s;cirrhus, which induce the&s;e tumours by imperceptible degrees, and very &s;low beginnings, which are attributed to &s;ome peculiar inde&s;cribable defect of the humours, terminating frequently in cancerous affections.</P>
<P>They are, be&s;ides, productive of great mi&s;chief from the com|pre&s;&s;ion of the neighbouring parts, as pal&s;y, impeded deglutition, barrenne&s;s, and many other complaints.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject of inflammation, we &s;hall be readily and forcibly &s;truck with the mo&s;t eligible modes of termination.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is by <HI>re&s;olution,</HI> the &s;econd by <HI>exudation,</HI> if the mat|ter exuded can have a free exit out of the habit; but in tho&s;e inflammatory affections which make the membrane that lines the cavity of the brea&s;t, and abdomen, or belly; or which cover the different vi&s;cera contained in them&mdash;the objects of their attack; and if the matter which from that cau&s;e exudes from their &s;ur|face &s;hould remain there, a hectic fever will be the con&s;equence,
<PB N="303" REF="028021_0299_0FD672B5ECAAFF60">
though the original pain cea&s;es, and a fre&s;h concour&s;e of &s;ymp|toms will then &s;ucceed. But &s;uppo&s;e neither of the&s;e termina|tions can be brought about, we then wi&s;h for ABSCESS, becau&s;e only the inert &s;olids &s;uffer chiefly, and &s;eldom have any perma|nent bad effects, if they can only be permitted to clear them&s;elves; for then the parts heal up; nor have the nerves or blood-ve&s;&s;els &s;uffered any material de&s;truction, though the la&s;t may have been di&s;tended, and &s;uffered greatly from &s;uch di&s;ten&s;ion; yet, once freed from the impelling cau&s;e, &s;oon recover their tone, &s;uffici|ently to perform properly their con&s;titutional action; and as for the inert &s;olids, they are again &s;oon &s;upplied, by the dige&s;tive powers of the machine forming fre&s;h materials from nutriment, in order to renew the &s;ub&s;tance lo&s;t, by the application of homo|geneous particles poured into the inter&s;tices of the celullar mem|brane.</P>
<P>In all our attempts to cure inflammatory complaints, our fir&s;t aim is <HI>re&s;olution,</HI> whether the part affected be exter|nal or internal; the former of which is obvious to ocular demon|&s;tration; the latter, by heat and pain affecting &s;ome inward part, accompanied with general febrile affections; of which we &s;hall &s;peak more particularly when we come to treat on parts labouring under this complaint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> at pre&s;ent we &s;hall &s;hew how we attempt to bring about re&s;olution, when any con&s;iderable in|flammation calls for our a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>If it occurs in habits which are plethoric and &s;trong, the pul&s;e full and quick, and much increa&s;e of heat, we pur&s;ue the &s;ame cour&s;e as was delivered when treating on inflammatory fever, &sect; 2. Section VIII. attempting to allay the inten&s;ene&s;s of motion in the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, and abating the exce&s;s of heat, which is the natural concomitant.</P>
<P>But here &s;ometimes the complaint yields not to general bleed|ing, we then &s;hould have recour&s;e to local, by the application of leeches or cupping-gla&s;&s;es near the part affected, which will ve|ry often &s;ucceed; and as there is too great a flow of fluids to the part, we endeavour to le&s;&s;en that by &s;mart cooling purges, (No. 3. 22 to 24.) giving freely in the intermediate times be|tween the purges, nitrous powder, (No. 2.) mixed with &s;mall do&s;es of antimonials, (180.) gentle aperients, (171, 172.) and o|ther cooling &s;aline diuretics, (176.) applying to the parts them|&s;elves fomentations, (No. 85.) with which let the part affected be fomented three or four times a day, and continued at each time for half an hour, or longer, taking care not to apply it too hot, but only moderately warm.</P>
<P>Afterwards the inflamed part &s;hould be covered with a white bread poultice, in which a &s;ufficient quantity of ointment of mar&s;h|mallows
<PB N="304" REF="028021_0300_0FD672BD5093A318">
has been u&s;ed&mdash;&s;ome advi&s;e a poultice of bread boiled in litharge water, called vegeto-mineral water; others of wine|lees thickened with bran; and &s;everal prefer that of bean-meal and &s;imple oxymel, &s;oftened with oil of ro&s;es&mdash;and &s;hould the tu|mor and inflammation be by the&s;e means di&s;&s;ipated, the poultices &s;hould be changed for &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pes moi&s;tened with the camphorated lo|tion, (No. 86.) and occa&s;ionally applied to the parts.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means commonly re&s;olution will take place, the hu|mours collected in the part being di&s;&s;ipated, and the remainder ab&s;orbed back into the habit, by the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem being freed &s;ufficiently, and &s;timulated to a reproduction of its action in the part affected.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding our efforts, if the common &s;ymptoms &s;hould gradually increa&s;e, &s;uch as great heat, throbbing in the part affected, &s;uppuration will take place, and an ab&s;ce&s;s be form|ed&mdash;here, then, our mode of cure mu&s;t be altered, and we mu&s;t aim at &s;oliciting the matter externally, and freeing the habit in a proper time, by the application of tho&s;e things which promote &s;uppuration, thin the external &s;kin, and determine the contained matter towards the &s;urface.</P>
<P>Hence poultices made of mallow leaves, boiled in milk with lin&s;eed, or lin&s;eed it&s;elf&mdash;boiled lily roots, or onions&mdash;the matu|rating catapla&s;m&mdash;or the gum plai&s;ter, will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e; for the&s;e, by clogging the pores of the &s;kin, prevent the di&s;&s;ipa|tion of the humours, increa&s;e the heat of the contained fluids, promote the proce&s;s of fermentation, and render the humours more active in di&s;&s;olving, or melting down the &s;olid parts, as well as &s;often the integuments, and, by their &s;timulus, &s;olicit the fluids to pu&s;h outwards.</P>
<P>From the&s;e applications, then, the ab&s;ce&s;s will &s;oon he in a pro|per &s;tate for opening; which mu&s;t be performed in the mo&s;t de|pendent part, if the &s;welling is equally &s;oft throughout, and the &s;kin of a &s;imilar thinne&s;s; if not, where the part is &s;ofte&s;t, and the fluctuation of the matter mo&s;t perceptible; and the aper|ture &s;hould be made of &s;ufficient width, in proportion to the &s;ize of the tumor, that a free egre&s;s may be allowed for the mat|ter.</P>
<P>After this, the healing of the wound in good con&s;titutions is &s;eldom attended with any difficulty&mdash;dry lint placed gently in the part, and that covered with the ointment of yellow re&s;in, &s;pread thin upon lint or tow, are the general dre&s;&s;ings at fir&s;t; and from the&s;e fre&s;h granulations will appear; and in time fill up the ca|vity occa&s;ioned by the lo&s;s of &s;ub&s;tance; but &s;hould the &s;ore ap|pear &s;oul, covered at the bottom with a white or brown appear|ance, in&s;tead of red granulated fle&s;h, we mu&s;t apply &s;ome of tho&s;e
<PB N="305" REF="028021_0301_0FD627EB46063898">
things con&s;idered detergent, or clean&s;ing; as the ointment of gum elemi, of yellow re&s;in, mixed with a proper proportion of red precipitate, or green ba&s;ilicon; the&s;e will clean&s;e the ulcer; and then dry lint as before, and proper bandages, will in common perform a perfect cure.</P>
<P>But &s;ometimes, in&s;tead of a thick well-coloured laudable mat|ter, there will be a thin ichorous di&s;charge, occa&s;ioned by an acri|monious &s;tate of humours, while, at the &s;ame time, there will be febrile hectic &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, in order to produce a laudable &s;up|puration, and take off the hectic affections, in relaxed habits, joined with an acrid &s;tate of the fluids, bark is the mo&s;t effica|cious remedy; but where the di&s;charge depends more upon the &s;tate of the fluids, in order to correct or evacuate the acrimony, a cour&s;e of mercurial medicines, as the alternative mercurial pills, two of which may be taken twice a day, with one or two pints of the decoction of the woods, (No. 87, 88.) bid faire&s;t for &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>There is a &s;pecies of complaint very common belonging to this place, which here calls for our attention, and that is, a</P>
<P>BOIL, or BILE, though this &s;eldom terminates by re&s;olution, but commonly maturates&mdash;it is a hard circum&s;cribed tumour, ri&s;ing to a point, hot, red, and very painful, which, maturating, may be let out, or left to bur&s;t, from whence a &s;mall portion of matter only will i&s;&s;ue forth, in proportion to the &s;welling, leav|ing a &s;lough behind, which is called a CORE, and mu&s;t be ca&s;t off before the wound can be healed.</P>
<P>In its hard and painful &s;tate, we can have no expectations of di&s;cu&s;&s;ions; our endeavours, therefore, are to be confined to ha&s;|tening the &s;uppuration, as we have before directed, (304.) or ap|ply bean-meal and honey, which is a favourite remedy with &s;ome&mdash;when it is opened or bur&s;t, we mu&s;t proceed as before under the &s;ame circum&s;tances in ab&s;ce&s;s (304.)</P>
<P>But the&s;e eruptions very often originate from a depraved &s;tate of the fluids, which occa&s;ion their frequent returns, and are ex|tremely trouble &s;ome&mdash;here we mu&s;t have reference to the altera|tive cour&s;e before recommended, (305.) which mu&s;t be per&s;i&s;ted in for &s;ome time, now and then interpo&s;ing gentle cooling purgatives.</P>
<P>Thus far we have &s;poken of tho&s;e inflammations which lie &s;u|perficially, and are alleviated by <HI>appea&s;ing</HI> applications; but &s;ometimes the &s;eat of the complaint will be too internal for them to become effectual, we then apply over the part &s;timulants, which have been found highly efficacious in producing re&s;olu|tion&mdash;indeed, where complaints have been &s;light, applications of hot &s;and or &s;alt, &s;timulating catapla&s;ms, as of mu&s;tard, pelli|tory, hor&s;e-radi&s;h, Burgundy pitch, volatile liniments rubbed well upon the part, have been found &s;erviceable auxiliaries; but
<PB N="306" REF="028021_0302_0FD672BEC69CF288">
when the &s;ymptoms have been more &s;evere, bli&s;ters applied over the part contribute the mo&s;t readily to promote re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The&s;e remedies, and the &s;edatives and emollients we have be|fore &s;poken of, where the cau&s;e has been exce&s;s of the vibratory motion of the ve&s;&s;els dependent on &s;ome &s;timulus, and external remedies can be applied, have been thought nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;or when inflammation proceeds from fractures, wounds, contu&s;ions, or &s;uch like cau&s;es, di&s;cutient fomentations, (No. 85.) are mo&s;t of all to be relied on&mdash;when it depends on <HI>local relaxation,</HI> or <HI>a decrea&s;e of va&s;cular re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> as it &s;ometimes does, particularly in inflam|mations of long &s;tanding&mdash;bleeding and purging &s;hould be cau|tiou&s;ly advi&s;ed, and all emollient poultices and fomentations omit|ted; for the&s;e, by their relaxing properties, will add to the cau&s;e a contrary plan mu&s;t be adopted, calculated to give &s;trength and acti|vity to the ve&s;&s;els, that the offending cau&s;e may be repelled.</P>
<P>For local applications, alum, white vitriol, acetated litharge, lapis calaminaris, and turty prepared, mixed with ro&s;e-water, are occa&s;ionally u&s;ed; as are al&s;o tincture of ro&s;es, and &s;light decoctions of bark, and eye-waters; gargles made of the&s;e well adapted to relieve inflammatory complaints ari&s;ing from a debi|litated and relaxed &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;els&mdash;and where the general &s;tate of the habit is &s;o relaxed, as to demand the u&s;e of tonics, or &s;uch things as invigorate the &s;y&s;tem, bark and cold bathing are highly u&s;eful.</P>
<P>By the modes we have laid down, we &s;hall almo&s;t always be able to conquer any common inflammation; or conduct our patient through with the greate&s;t ea&s;e and &s;afety, if ab&s;ce&s;s &s;hould take place&mdash;but there are &s;ome niceties to be ob&s;erved, which we &s;hall particularize.</P>
<P>Fomentations &s;hould never be pu&s;hed too far; for, after tak|ing off the violence of va&s;cular motion, if continued, they induce a &s;tate of relaxation in the fibres, from which &s;ucceed debility, and ob&s;tinate tumours&mdash;in&s;tead, therefore, in per&s;evering in their u&s;e, when exce&s;s of vibratory motion is &s;ubdued totally, and it many ca&s;es when it is allayed, corroborants then become nece&s;&s;a|ry, (No. 86.) or &s;omething of a &s;imilar nature.</P>
<P>With regard to ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that they all point, and the contained matter endeavours to make its way to the parts where it finds the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance&mdash;hence tho&s;e formed in the lungs rupture internally; tho&s;e in the vi&s;cera of the belly move externally&mdash;tho&s;e which are deep &s;eated, and formed under &s;trong tendinous expan&s;ions, run along the &s;paces between the mu&s;cles, and appear at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from whence they fir&s;t originated.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, they do not all originate from inflammation pre&s;erv|ing its regular cour&s;e; they are &s;ometimes critical, the effect of
<PB N="307" REF="028021_0303_0FD627EFB94C9FF8">
nature freeing the con&s;titution from &s;ome morbid matter, by throwing it out of the circulation, and depo&s;iting it in &s;ome lo|cal &s;ituation, which is attended with the mo&s;t happy con&s;equenc|es, admit the vital organs, or the parts of high importance in the habit e&s;cape, from its being depo&s;ited in them. Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es of this kind are generally preceded by &s;ome fever; and this depo|tion of matter is called meta&s;ta&s;is, or tran&s;lation, which occurs chiefly in parts where the ve&s;&s;els labour under &s;ome uncommon weakne&s;s, from &s;ome cau&s;e which has left them in that &s;tate.</P>
<P>Under this circum&s;tance, as &s;oon as ever the &s;kin is in a proper &s;tate of thinne&s;s, the matter mu&s;t be let out by inci&s;ion, if it can be come at, el&s;e would it, by too long continuance, di&s;&s;olve too much of the &s;olid parts, de&s;troy the texture of the nerves and blood-ve&s;&s;els, produce a caries, or mortification of the bones, by penetrating through the membrane which covers them, and lay the foundation for a hectic fever, from the matter being taken up by the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, and carried into the habit.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es of EXUDATION, (300.) where the &s;urface appears on|ly excoriated, not ulcerated, we can give the happie&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when it &s;hews it&s;elf externally by <HI>internally</HI> exhibiting &s;uch things as tend to promote re&s;olution; and having recour&s;e <HI>externally</HI> to &s;uch as are calculated to clean&s;e, heal up, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> then.</P>
<P>And when &s;uch is the circum&s;tance on the membranes of the brea&s;t, of the belly, or the external &s;urface of the vi&s;cera, as it &s;ometimes is, we are a&s;&s;ured, from the appearances on di&s;&s;ection, where there has been no perceptible ulcerations or de&s;truction of the &s;olids, though matter has been found in the&s;e cavities; by early advice judiciou&s;ly given, many might be &s;aved from &s;ome of our mo&s;t fatal complaints, pulmonary, and &s;ome other con|&s;umptions; for many of the&s;e ari&s;e not, <HI>in the fir&s;t in&s;tance,</HI> from ulcerations or little glandular tumors in the lungs, called tuber|cles, but from matter exuded from membranous &s;urfaces, which acquire a degree of acrimony, and then, by melting down the &s;o|lids, cau&s;e ulcerations: and I have no doubt but by a very early application to&s;uch modes as we have &s;pecified for re&s;olution, the&s;e mi&s;chiefs might be often prevented&mdash;but here the great misfor|tune is delay; patients, in the infancy of this complaint, by dabs, no&s;trums, and old family pre&s;criptions, lo&s;ing the favourable op|portunity which ought to be given to the well-informed phy&s;i|cian, applying for &s;uch aid only when &s;ome of the internal parts have &s;uffered irrecoverable injury.</P>
<P>Though we have before &s;poken of the ery&s;ipelas, or Saint An|thony's fire, which ari&s;es from a febrile cau&s;e, there is another &s;ort which &s;ometimes &s;ucceeds external injury; and in this, if the inflammation runs high, bleeding and purging are highly ef|ficacious; and in the intermediate times, betwixt the admini&s;tra|ting
<PB N="308" REF="028021_0304_0FD672C0332EAD28">
of purgatives, I depend upon &s;aline diuretics, (176.) and even tho&s;e purgatives which I prefer, are &s;uch as mo&s;t powerfully eva|cuate the &s;erous humours, &s;uch as vitriolated natron, Rochelle &s;alt, regenerated tartar, jalap, &s;yrup of buck thorn, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The external applications in the&s;e ca&s;es &s;hould be &s;uch as will expel the ob&s;tructed fluids through the pores of the &s;kin; hence diluent fomentations are recommended, decoction of lin&s;eed, and white poppy heads, with elder and chamomile flowers, and a pro|per proportion of &s;oap liniment, one ounce and a half to two ounces to a quart, whil&s;t there is no break upon the &s;kin&mdash;chalk, or fine flour, &s;pread upon the part, and confined with a fine rag&mdash;and lotions of the vegeto-mineral water are thought by &s;ome highly &s;erviceable, where re&s;olution is the aim.</P>
<P>But when pimples or painful bli&s;ters make their appearance, equal parts of lime-water, oil, vinegar, and comphorated &s;pirit of wine, form an efficacious compo&s;ition to lay on the inflamed part, by means of a rag dipped into, and well loaded with it&mdash;or the ointment called unguentum tripharmacum, or that of a|cetated ceru&s;s, have been con&s;idered as proper applications.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now proceed to &s;peak on MORTIFICATION, another termination of inflammation, (301.) which generally proceeds in the following manner. At fir&s;t the &s;welled part begins at the point to grow yellow, the pain is mitigated, and a dingy colour comes on; the &s;kin is flabby and &s;oft, retaining the impre&s;&s;ion made by a finger upon it, it lo&s;es almo&s;t all &s;en&s;ation, and grows livid&mdash;a tumid elevation of the part is perceived, which diffu&s;es it&s;elf around&mdash;there appears pu&s;tules of a thin yellowi&s;h acri|monious liquid, which are black at their ba&s;is&mdash;then the &s;kin and parts underneath corrupt, become dead, black, lo&s;ing all &s;en|&s;ation, and di&s;&s;olve into a foetid &s;tinking &s;anies&mdash;the mortification creeps onwards, and &s;eizes the neighbouring parts&mdash;at length &s;hivering, fever, cold &s;weats, &s;mall and weak pul&s;e, and faint|ing, be&s;peak the approach of death.</P>
<P>In the beginning, when the &s;ource of this mi&s;chief has been external injury, and there is much &s;trength of con&s;titution, in|dicated by a full, hard, quick pul&s;e, high degrees of heat, pain, and dryne&s;s, the cooling method is to be pur&s;ued, as if re&s;olu|tion was to be brought about; and though in this we cannot hope to &s;ucceed, we are warranted in this mode of procedure, by the extreme violence of the &s;ymptoms, with intent to bring on a &s;tate of &s;uppuration, by checking the vehemence of the circula|tion, and preventing the ve&s;&s;els from being ruptured&mdash;be&s;ides, exudation would be favoured from the continuance of relaxing and emollient fomentations.</P>

<P>We &s;hould be particularly careful in di&s;tingui&s;hing this di&s;|ea&s;e from the delirium, that common attendant in many fevers: and this knowledge may be acquired by ob&s;erving, <HI>that in this &s;pecies the delirium comes on fir&s;t, and is perceptible and violent be|fore there is any great degree of fever</HI>&mdash;in other ca&s;es it is con&s;e|quent to fever which has continued for &s;ome days before the de|lirium is manife&s;t; and the degree of phrenzy is corre&s;pondent to the degree of fever; but in the true inflammation of the brain the degree of fever is nearly adequate to the delirium, which is equal to what we meet with in real madne&s;s, from which the inflammation of the brain is &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, but by the &s;hortne&s;s of the continuance; as in the &s;pace of a few days it mu&s;t either inevitably terminate in recovery or death.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is either idiopathic, (299.) or &s;ymptomatic, (299.)&mdash;the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> wherein the head is primarily affected, rarely appears in temperate climates&mdash;but the <HI>&s;econd</HI> very often occurs, and mo&s;t frequently about the cri&s;is of fevers; and is generally at|tended with chillne&s;s, tremor of the joints, di&s;ten&s;ion about the pit of the &s;tomach, coldne&s;s of the extremities, thin urine di&s;|charged too copiou&s;ly, or too &s;paringly; and mo&s;t commonly, if violent, proves mortal, from the con&s;titution being reduced to a &s;tate of great weakne&s;s from the preceding di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>From the great con&s;equence of which the brain is to the life of man, this becomes a mo&s;t dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, from that part being affected&mdash;men experience greater degrees of violence in this di&s;ea&s;e, and recover with more difficulty than women&mdash;the more the patients are, and the more they recede, from their natural &s;tate and di&s;po&s;ition, the greater is the danger&mdash;bleeding at the no&s;e is a good omen; but if the phrenzy changes into a lethargy, it is bad; and total lo&s;s of, or a trembling voice, convul&s;ions, hiccough, may be looked on as extremely unfavourable &s;ymptoms.</P>

<HEAD>INFLAMMATION OF THE EYE.</HEAD>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o very obvious to every common ob&s;erver, that there &s;eems <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a nece&s;&s;ity for putting down the appearances, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h it; however, to pre&s;erve the regularity we have adop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> in other complaints, we &s;hall give of it a con|ci&s;e view.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. This complaint at the beginning is attend|ed with heat, redne&s;s, and &s;welling, or fulne&s;s of the eye&mdash;and often feels as if a particle of &s;and, or a &s;mall fly, had got into it, and there fixed&mdash;the eye is painful, tears flow, which appear hot and &s;calding&mdash;the angles of the eye are often filled with a vi&s;cid, yellowi&s;h matter, particularly after &s;leeping&mdash;the &s;ight is weak, and all light is offen&s;ive&mdash;<HI>in the more &s;evere &s;pecies,</HI> the pain is very acute&mdash;the pul&s;e quick and rather hard&mdash;the light intolera|ble&mdash;there is a perceptible pul&s;ation of the arteries&mdash;and the eye|lids, with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> parts, &s;well; but <HI>when it is &s;till more &s;evere,</HI> the membrane covering the white of the eye elevates it|&s;elf above the darker coloured part, called cornea, from its horny appearance&mdash;and the patients complain of flies flying before them, and feel other unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ations of this kind, the effect of ima|gination.&mdash;Afterwards &s;ucceed &s;uppurations, &s;pi&s;&s;itude, of the hu|mours&mdash;&s;pots upon, and thickne&s;s of the cornea it&s;elf.</P>
<P>From this account there appears to ari&s;e three material con|&s;iderations: FIRST, whether it is &s;light, affecting only the ve&s;&s;els of the outward membrane of the eye;&mdash;SECOND, whether it is very &s;evere, extending it&s;elf to the eyelids, and their edges, call|ed tar&s;i;&mdash;THIRD, whether it is extremely violent, fixing its feat in the internal ve&s;&s;els of the eye it&s;elf, and in tho&s;e of the mem|brane called <HI>retina,</HI> at the bottom of the eye, which is con&s;ider|ed the &s;eat of vi&s;ion; in which ca&s;e it is attended with high de|gree of fever, intolerable pain, and often delirium. For the&s;e di&s;tinctions will make &s;ome alterations in our modes of cure.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote,</HI> or <HI>inducing,</HI> are&mdash;external injuries occa&s;ioned by blows&mdash;du&s;t getting into the eye, or other &s;timu|lating bodies&mdash;a free admi&s;&s;ion of cold wind&mdash;&s;weats &s;uddenly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed&mdash;looking frequently or long at the fire, the &s;un, or other &s;trong glaring colours&mdash;expo&s;ure to the cold air of the morning and evening, which &s;ucceeds hot and &s;un-&s;hiny weather&mdash;acrid and metalline fumes&mdash;couching, or extracting a cataract. It al&s;o may proceed from internal cau&s;es&mdash;&s;uch as the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;alutary evacuations&mdash;humors repelled&mdash;drying up of i&s;&s;ues&mdash;

<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Redne&s;s, and pain in the eye&mdash;with incapability of bearing the light.</P>
<P>CURE. With regard to this we are to take into our account the immediate cau&s;e&mdash;whether it is an increa&s;ed irritability in the ve&s;&s;els; or a want of proper re&s;i&s;tance in their coats; or they both co-operate together&mdash;for, according to the acting cau&s;e, &s;o &s;hould our applications differ; as what would in one ca&s;e produce a good effect, would in the other be attended with dan|gerous, or at lea&s;t di&s;agreeable effects.</P>
<P>In the &s;lighter degrees of this complaint, the cure is perfectly ea&s;y, as little more is requi&s;ite than external applications&mdash;wa&s;h|ing the eyes with warm milk and water, mixed with a little brandy&mdash;con&s;erve of ro&s;es&mdash;roa&s;ted apples, and &s;ome &s;uch reme|dies.</P>
<P>But in more &s;evere affections, if the habit is full, general bleeding and purgatives are nece&s;&s;ary, with a cooling regimen&mdash;to which, if the di&s;order does not &s;oon give way, not le&s;s than three leeches &s;hould be applied, as near each other as po&s;&s;ible, in the hollow of the temple neare&s;t the eye affected&mdash;opening the jugular vein is often &s;erviceable;&mdash;bleeding in the eye it&s;elf has by &s;ome been &s;trongly recommended; but the operation is apt to irritate, and is only nece&s;&s;ary when the inflammation is kept up by a &s;peck in the eye, which is fed by one or more blood ve&s;&s;els, then they may be divided.</P>
<P>In ob&s;tinate ca&s;es, keeping the head &s;haved is highly proper, and applying bli&s;ters about the &s;ize of half a crown over the orifices made by the leeches, is u&s;eful;&mdash;bathing the feet in warm water &s;hould not be neglected.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the local applications, the chief, and mo&s;t u&s;e|ful, is the tinctura Thebaica of the London Pharmacopaeia as an opiate, joined with &s;ome &s;timulant, for without, it will not an|&s;wer;&mdash;at fir&s;t the anodyne eye-water (No. 91.) may be applied to the eye two or three times a day.

<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es, though, where the inflammation has been long continued, its duration will be apparently owing to want of pro|per re&s;i&s;tance in the ve&s;&s;els&mdash;hence mu&s;t recour&s;e be had to &s;uch medicines as give &s;trength and activity to them; &s;till &s;ome cau|tion

is here nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;they &s;hould only be applied when the eye is in the weake&s;t &s;tate of inflammation, which generally happens in the morning, after the eye has been kept &s;ome time free from any irritating cau&s;e.&mdash;In the&s;e ca&s;es the coagulum alumino&s;um of the old London Di&s;pen&s;atory may be mixed with a common poultice, and applied to the eye affected for three or four hours in a morning&mdash;and in the remainder of the day, tincture of opium&mdash;afterwards as the eye gets &s;trength the vitriolic &s;olution, No. 92, may be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>By this method I have &s;een inflammations of the eyes of long &s;tanding, cured, which had re&s;i&s;ted every other mode&mdash;the quantity of the vitriol may be gradually increa&s;ed to 10 or 12 grains.</P>
<P>In all inflammations of the eyes ari&s;ing from common cau&s;es, one of the modes above &s;pecified will generally &s;ucceed&mdash;only we &s;hould be careful not to u&s;e any of the more &s;timulant ap|plications, till the inflammation begins to relax of its violence, for if they are u&s;ed too &s;oon, they will rather increa&s;e, than &s;ub|due the malady.</P>
<P>But &s;ometimes this di&s;ea&s;e will be occa&s;ioned, and &s;upported by &s;ome morbid humour in the habit&mdash;as that called &s;crophu|lous&mdash;venereal&mdash;or &s;ome other which we are incapable of di&s;|covering.&mdash;In the two former ca&s;es, we mu&s;t make u&s;e of tho&s;e remedies pointed out in the treatment of tho&s;e complaints&mdash;in the latter, a cour&s;e of alteratives in which mercury has the greate&s;t &s;hare, will be mo&s;t efficacious.

<HEAD>THE TONSILLARY INFLAMMATORY QUINSY, OR COMMON SORE THROAT.</HEAD>
<P>DESCRIPTION. In this the ton&s;ils and &s;uperior part of the fauces are affected&mdash;in general the inflammation begins in one ton&s;il, then &s;preads acro&s;s the palate, &s;eizes the uvula, and other ton&s;il.</P>
<P>Though con&s;iderable pain attends the action of &s;wallowing if only one &s;ide of the fauces is affected, yet can that action be per|formed tolerably well; but the pain becomes intolerably &s;evere when both &s;ides are affected, and &s;wallowing is performed with extreme difficulty; indeed, the pain is &s;ometimes &s;o great as, in delicate and irritable habits, to occa&s;ion convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>It may, however, appear &s;ingular, that more pain &s;hould be felt in &s;wallowing liquids than &s;olids; but this is the fact, be|cau&s;e a greater portion of mu&s;cular fibres are employed in the deglutition of the former than the latter.</P>
<P>So long as the inflammation confines it&s;elf to the parts above de&s;cribed there is little danger, more particularly if the neck appears puffed up, for this &s;eems to indicate le&s;s danger of &s;uf|focation, and is therefore con&s;idered a favourable omen.</P>
<P>But if the inflammation extends it&s;elf to the mu&s;cles of the larynx, in that degree as to impede the opening of the glottis, or &s;uperior part of the windpipe, the complaint becomes extremely precarious, becau&s;e then there will be great apprehen&s;ion of &s;uf|focation.</P>
<P>Or &s;hould the brain or lungs be affected by a tran&s;lation of the morbid matter, from the one occa&s;ioning violent head-ach and &s;trong delirium; and from the other oppre&s;&s;ion of the che&s;t and difficulty of breathing. If to what we have here &s;aid we add the febrile &s;ymptoms which commonly attend inflammation, and the
<PB N="319" REF="028021_0315_0FD6729371F0D5F8">
apppearances in the throat, (315.) we cannot avoid di&s;tingui&s;hing the complaints.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing</HI> are, per&s;piration ob&s;truct|ed, particularly in the neck&mdash;the admi&s;&s;ion of cold air into the fauces, e&s;pecially if it ru&s;hes rapidly into the mouth, and &s;trikes them forcibly&mdash;violent and long continued &s;inging&mdash;&s;houting, or too &s;evere exerci&s;e of the part&mdash;any acrid &s;timulating particles, or hard pungent bodies adhering to the parts&mdash;drinking too cold water&mdash;&s;uppre&s;&s;ed or impeded evacuations&mdash;or a peculiar &s;tate of the air rendering this complaint epidemical.</P>
<P>The <HI>proximate</HI> or <HI>immediate,</HI> &s;imilar to tho&s;e of other inflamma|tory complaints.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Redne&s;s, tumor, heat, of the ton&s;ils, rendering deglutition painful, attended with febrile inflammatory &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>CURE. The &s;ame rules are to be ob&s;erved as in other inflam|mations, re&s;pecting the general treatment, &s;uch as bleeding, purg|ing, cooling, diluting medicines, and regimen. With regard to local application, it is of u&s;e to apply &s;tupes of flannel dipped in &s;pirits of &s;al ammoniac, or hart&s;horn, mixed with a little oil, and applied to the throat in the &s;lighter ca&s;es&mdash;in the more &s;evere, bli&s;ters; for the&s;e &s;olicit the matter from the internal to the ex|ternal parts.</P>
<P>Gargles al&s;o of &s;age tea and vinegar, or infu&s;ions of elder and chamomile flowers, in equal parts of water and vinegar, apply|ing the &s;teams of this to the throat; they are of infinite u&s;e, and give great relief, favouring the exudation and di&s;&s;ipation of the ob&s;tructing fluids.</P>
<P>After the imflammation is abated, gargles more a&s;tringent &s;hould be u&s;ed, made of tincture of ro&s;es, or red port, with the vitriolic or muriatic acid, &s;weetened with honey&mdash;al&s;o to them may be added a &s;mall portion of alum, or weak decoctions of bark, with the acids above-mentioned, or alum; for the&s;e will give &s;trength to the fibres, which, from over di&s;ten&s;ion, have been weakened and relaxed&mdash;and, for gargling the throat, per|haps, &s;yringes had better be made u&s;e of, both on account of ea&s;e and certainty in reaching the part affected.</P>
<P>By this mode the cure in common will be completed within the cour&s;e of four or five days; but if within this time the in|flammatory &s;ymptoms &s;hould not become <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and the inflam|mation it&s;elf &s;ub&s;ide, then will little doubt remain of &s;uppuration taking place; di&s;coverable by the following SYMPTOMS OF AB|SCESS forming; <HI>the febrile &s;ymptoms continue though in a &s;lighter degree, the pul&s;e grows &s;ofter, the florid colour of the inflamed part

abates, the pain becomes more bearable, and &s;light &s;hiverings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on frequently.</HI></P>
<P>Here we mu&s;t endeavour to promote &s;uppuration as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, by applying maturating poultice to the throat exter|nally; and internally, decoction of figs; or infu&s;ion of li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;hould be drank very warm, and &s;wallowed gradually; careful|ly, at the &s;ame time, watching for the appearance of ab&s;ce&s;s, which generally di&s;covers it&s;elf in a few days, by a whiti&s;h tu|mor, and fluctuation of a fluid to the touch&mdash;&s;hould not this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of it&s;elf in a few days, which, though, is generally the ca&s;e, it &s;hould be opened as early as may be, and detergent gargles of barley-water, honey of ro&s;es, vinegar, and tincture of myrrh, may be had recour&s;e to. (No. 93.)</P>
<P>When the ab&s;ce&s;s is perceptible to the &s;ight, and within the reach of external remedies, this method mu&s;t be pur&s;ued; but &s;ometimes it forms it&s;elf &s;o low down as not to be within the reach of in&s;truments; we mu&s;t therefore wait for its bur&s;ting; and &s;hould, before this happens, the tumor be &s;o large as to pre|vent &s;wallowing, the patient mu&s;t be &s;upported by broth or milk gly&s;ters; and bli&s;ters and &s;timulant poultices &s;hould be applied to the throat externally, in order to &s;olicit the morbid matter outwardly.</P>
<P>The con&s;equences in the&s;e ca&s;es is very rarely fatal, when there is a &s;uppuration; however alarming may be the appear|ances, or tedious the proce&s;s.</P>
<P>But, now and then, this complaint ari&s;es from the want of proper re&s;i&s;tance in the ve&s;&s;els of tho&s;e parts, di&s;coverable by the relaxed &s;tate of the &s;olids, manife&s;ted <HI>by weaker degrees of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and pain, and more &s;light inflammatory appearances re&s;pecting the colour of the parts</HI> as they are le&s;s red, than in the former.</P>
<P>In the&s;e ca&s;es copious bleeding is rarely nece&s;&s;ary; purgatives are more to be depended upon, and the application of &s;timulants and bli&s;ters locally and externally&mdash;gargles &s;hould be of the pun|gent kind, made of the infu&s;ion of hor&s;e radi&s;h, or mu&s;tard &s;eed, or &s;ome other of the pungent &s;timulants, (145, 146.) for the&s;e at|tenuate the vi&s;cid mucus which clogs the follicles or cells of the ton&s;ils, and other contiguous glandular parts, that crowd the fau|ces, by &s;timulating the ve&s;&s;els to an increa&s;e of proper action on their &s;tagnating mucus; for the&s;e &s;ore throats are con&s;idered as pituitous.</P>
<P>In habits like the&s;e of the phlegmatic kind, (60.) ab&s;ce&s;&s;es &s;el|dom ari&s;e; but &s;hould that be the ca&s;e, they require the &s;ame mode of treatment as above &s;pecified; to which mu&s;t be added tonic and corroborant medicines internally, as well as externally, in order to give tone and firmne&s;s to the ve&s;&s;els after proper de|tergents,
<PB N="321" REF="028021_0317_0FD67294B47AB528">
and add &s;trength to the con&s;titution, as bark, &s;teel, with it generous and nutritious diet.</P>
<P>The &s;ame mode mu&s;t be pur&s;ued in the SECOND and THIRD SPECIES, in their inflammatory &s;tate; to which if the di&s;ea&s;e does not yield, and there is rea&s;on to be afraid of &s;uffocation, from the high degree of inflammation of the mu&s;cles of the larynx, pre|venting proper re&s;piration, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to bronchotomy, or opening the windpipe, though not without extreme nece&s;&s;ity, and then it mu&s;t be performed by the hands of the mo&s;t &s;kilful &s;urgeon, for it is attended with the utmo&s;t danger.</P>
<P>But &s;ometimes the inflammation not only attacks the membrane lining the upper part of the trachea, but extends it&s;elf down on the interior &s;urface into the lungs, which &s;urface is found, on di&s;&s;ection, to be covered over, and the pa&s;&s;age for the air almo&s;t filled up with a thick &s;lough, having a fibrous membrane-like appearance, which is concluded to be the vi&s;cid remains of mu|cus thrown off by exudation from the inflamed &s;urfaces&mdash;and is di&s;coverable by a <HI>peculiar &s;hrillne&s;s of the voice, like the crowing of the cock, with a cough,</HI> but no &s;ickne&s;s, nor at fir&s;t much diffi|culty of breathing.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is at certain times epidemic, and &s;eizes chiefly children, and runs to its fatal termination &s;o extremely rapid, that little chance is given to any medical applications, from the want of time&mdash;immediate vomiting, and bli&s;tering the throat, are the whole we can, perhaps, depend upon for any the lea&s;t pro&s;|pect of &s;ucce&s;s. This variety of the trachel quin&s;y is called the CROUP, and is more frequent in Scotland than el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The FOURTH SPECIES, or the PAROTIDEAL QUINSY, or M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">MPS, called al&s;o MAXILLARY, from its affecting the maxillary as well as the parotid glands, and al&s;o the mu&s;cles and ligaments which rai&s;e up and connect the upper with the lower jaw, from which is nece&s;&s;arily felt &s;evere pain in opening the mouth.</P>
<P>In this the &s;welling is generally external, increa&s;ing &s;o much in a few days, particularly in the lower part of the face, and un|der the chin, as almo&s;t to obliterate the features, though the at|tendant fever is but &s;light.</P>
<P>Saline purgatives, with nitrous medicines, moderate bleeding, and external &s;timulants, chiefly volatile liniments, are all that are required, keeping at the &s;ame time the head and face warm, and free from external cold.</P>
<P>But there is a &s;ingular peculiarity now and then attending this complaint; for &s;ometimes on the &s;welling of the glands &s;ub&s;iding, a &s;imilar affection of the te&s;ticles of men takes place, and of the brea&s;ts in women&mdash;however, no alteration in the cure is required;
<PB N="322" REF="028021_0318_0FD672D1E8060478">
for it has been ob&s;erved, that to the &s;ame it yielded, nor were the parts, particularly the te&s;tes, ever known to &s;uppurate.</P>
<P>Sometimes a hardne&s;s will remain in the parotid and maxilla|ry glands; the&s;e yield to &s;mall do&s;es of calomel, and gentle purg|ing; &s;ometimes the application of the quick&s;ilver ointment hath been nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD>5. TONSILLARY MALIGNANT ULCEROUS SORE THROAT, (318.) OR MALIGNANT SCARLET FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>This has often raged in England, and appears to be a quin&s;y, or &s;ore throat, of a more malignant nature, attended with a re|mittent fever, verging more to the putre&s;cent than inflammatory &s;ort; or running very rapidly from the former into the latter.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e oftener attacks, and with a greater degree of vio|lence, infants and young children than adults; girls than boys; the infirm than tho&s;e in the vigour of health; tho&s;e of a pale, wan complexion, and relaxed habit, with an acrimonious &s;tate of fluids, than the robu&s;t and &s;anguineous; and appears particu|larly in autumn, preceded by a hot &s;ummer.</P>

&s;ymptoms; indeed, they frequently increa&s;e, and, added to them there is often a <HI>purging</HI>&mdash;at this time the patient begins to <HI>throw about his arms and legs,</HI> lying in a &s;tate of great inquietude; or he becomes <HI>drow&s;y</HI>&mdash;there now comes on <HI>great pro&s;tration of &s;trength&mdash;the con&s;titutional powers fail&mdash;&s;wallowing</HI> grows more difficult&mdash;the <HI>breathing</HI> more laborious&mdash;and before the &s;ixth day the patient expires in a &s;tate of &s;uffocation.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote</HI> and <HI>inducing,</HI> as in all di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from any &s;pecific infection, or contagion, is a predi&s;po&s;ition in the habit to receive and feel the effects of the morbid matter, which we conceive to be of a peculiar nature capable of creating the di&s;ea&s;e, communicated from the air, or bodies before affect|ed, which con&s;titutes the <HI>proximate</HI> or <HI>immediate</HI> cau&s;e; for fre|quently the di&s;ea&s;e, either from the breath, or contaminated mat|ter &s;pit up, will attack the attendants, and a whole family&mdash;a &s;trong proof that the di&s;ea&s;e is infectious and contagious.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. (See page 319.) And here it is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to di&s;tingui&s;h this from the &s;imp|ly inflammatory &s;ore throat, which may be done by the loo&s;ene&s;s and vomiting&mdash;the puffy and dark-coloured redne&s;s attending the &s;welling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the foetid ulcers of the throat, covered with a white &s;lough&mdash;from the hoar&s;ene&s;s of the voice&mdash;the &s;light de|lirium coming on &s;o &s;oon&mdash;and from the &s;udden and great pro&s;|tration of &s;trength&mdash;becau&s;e much depends upon the mode of cure fir&s;t adopted&mdash;for what will be the means of laying a foun|dation of a cure in the &s;imple inflammatory, would be the cau&s;e of death in the malignant quin&s;y.</P>
<P>The redne&s;s of the tumefied parts, brightne&s;s of the eyes, no great degrees of debility and fainting, the &s;lough being white, and the florid appearance of the eruption on the &s;kin, are favourable omens.</P>
<P>But if the debility &s;hould be violent; if the ulcers are a&s;h-co|loured, black, or livid; if there &s;hould be a diarrhoea, rigor, weak and &s;mall pul&s;e; the body put on a cadaverous appear|ance; the eyes lo&s;e their &s;plendour; the eruptions di&s;appear, or become livid; and particularly if the no&s;e bleeds&mdash;the wor&s;t mu&s;t be expected.</P>
<P>CURE. The indications of cure are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of pu|trid fever, (223, &amp;c.) to which we mu&s;t add, the healing of the ulcers.</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t malignant kind, little can be expected from our endeavours, the progre&s;s to di&s;&s;olution is &s;o rapid.</P>

<P>If, then, at the on&s;et, there appears to be &s;trong va&s;cular ac|tion, &s;aline mixtures, with &s;light antimonials, and acid gargles, &s;lightly a&s;tringent, with occa&s;ional gentle aperients, or emollient gly&s;ters, if nece&s;&s;ary, after the admini&s;tration of a vomit, may be per&s;i&s;ted in, till &s;ymptoms of putre&s;cency make their appear|ance, which will &s;oon be the ca&s;e&mdash;then we mu&s;t rely on bli&s;|tering under the throat, and anti&s;eptics, as bark, mineral acids, ace&s;cent drinks, and vinous cordials, for relief.

<P>It is divided into the TRUE PLEURISY, when the membrane it&s;elf is affected&mdash;into the SPURIOUS, when the interco&s;tal mu&s;|cles; and al&s;o into MOIST, when expectoration is an a&s;&s;ociate; and DRY, when there is no &s;uch appearance&mdash;indeed, at the on&s;et it puts on generally the appearance of the latter, and of the form|er in its progre&s;s, if not conquered by re&s;olution; for then mo&s;t commonly expectoration takes place.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. At the commencement, the patient is ge|nerally attacked with chillne&s;s and &s;hivering, which are &s;uc|ceeded by heat, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, pain in the head and &s;ide, the la&s;t

very acute and pungent, running to the back and collar-bone&mdash;difficulty of lying on the &s;ide affected, with a dry cough, in|crea&s;ing the pain, which, after the third day, is attended with an expectoration of a thin, &s;anious, and &s;ometimes bloody mat|ter&mdash;the breathing is al&s;o very difficult and painful&mdash;the pul&s;e hard and ten&s;e&mdash;the blood, when drawn, firm in its texture, and covered with a coriaceous, or &s;ub&s;tance like buff-leather&mdash;the urine very high coloured&mdash;and all the &s;ymptoms of a peripneu|mony, which we &s;hall hereafter de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing</HI> are, ob&s;tructed or imped|ed per&s;piration&mdash;&s;trong exerci&s;e, cold, thick, heavy air admitted into the lungs, cold northerly winds&mdash;drinking of ardent &s;pirits&mdash;cold water drank when the body is over-heated. Sometimes it &s;ucceeds a quin&s;y, colic, and &s;pa&s;modic pains&mdash;&s;uppre&s;&s;ed eva|cuations&mdash;eruptions repelled, as the meazles and &s;mall-pox, &amp;c.&mdash;external injuries of the che&s;t&mdash;and, in fine, whatever will cre|ate a &s;timulus on the lungs po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an inflammatory di&s;po|&s;ition.</P>
<P>The <HI>proximate</HI> or <HI>immediate,</HI> an inflammation of the pleura run|ning along the exterior &s;urface of the lungs, or that part cover|ing the ribs; but mo&s;t frequently of <HI>both</HI> affected at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. A pungent pain of the &s;ide, attended with febrile affections, pain al&s;o in in&s;piration particularly increa&s;ed; a difficulty of lying down, for the mo&s;t part on the &s;ide affected; and very painful cough&mdash;in the begin|ning dry, afterwards moi&s;t, and often bloody.</P>
<P>CURE. The indications are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of inflammation of other parts&mdash;at the on&s;et, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to copious bleeding, and that repeated, if the &s;ymptoms continue urgent, according to the &s;trength of the patient&mdash;the blood &s;hould be taken from a large orifice; and in &s;trong full habits, and young up-grown &s;ubjects, not le&s;s than fourteen or &s;ixteen ounces&mdash;above the part in pain cupping-gla&s;&s;es may be applied, and blood taken away by tho&s;e means&mdash;if the pain &s;hould be relieved by the fir&s;t bleeding for &s;ome hours; and, notwith&s;tanding <HI>that,</HI> the pain and oppre&s;&s;ion return, the operation mu&s;t be repeated, and about twelve ounces more blood taken away; and, indeed, &s;hould the &s;ymptoms prove ob&s;tinate; and return in the cour&s;e of ten or twelve hours, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the operation again, and apply a bli&s;ter over the part affected, e&s;pecially if the inflammation appears to extend it&s;elf outwardly, or the pain has any great degree of &s;everity; for, indeed, our chief dependence re&s;ts on bleeding and local bli&s;tering, to weaken the tone of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, and &s;ubdue the violence of the action of the
<PB N="326" REF="028021_0322_0FD672CF3B7FE730">
ve&s;&s;els&mdash;after the fir&s;t bleeding, and in the intermediate times, &s;uch things &s;hould be admini&s;tered as will co-operate to promote the&s;e intentions&mdash;we mu&s;t, therefore, have recour&s;e to &s;uch things as are diluting, relaxing, and emollient, with cooling and aperient diuretics&mdash;hence may the patient drink copiou&s;ly of <HI>pectoral decoction, bran or lin&s;eed tea, almond milk, apple-water, lemonade;</HI> in all which portions of nitre may be di&s;&s;olved; and the body &s;hould be kept open with <HI>cooling and relaxing gly&s;ters,</HI> (No. 25, 26.)&mdash;<HI>a large &s;punge dipped in warm vinegar</HI> applied to the mouth and no&s;trils is u&s;eful, as well as diluting drinks, that the vapors may be received with the air into the lungs, relax the pores of the pulmonary ve&s;icles, promote exudation, and bring on expectoration, by unloading the di&s;tended blood-ve&s;&s;els, and making them permeable&mdash;or, for this purpo&s;e, the <HI>&s;teams of warm water, or &s;ome emollient decoction,</HI> might be received into the lungs by inhaling them from the &s;pout of a large tea-pot; or by MUDGE's inhaler, contrived for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Emollient fomentations,</HI> or <HI>hags filled with boiled herbs,</HI> might be applied over the parts&mdash;<HI>oily medicines,</HI> forming emul&s;ions or linctus's, (No. 81 to 84.) might be taken internally occa&s;ionally&mdash;and <HI>nitre,</HI> mixed <HI>with a little camphor,</HI> or <HI>antimonials</HI>&mdash;and <HI>&s;a|line mixtures</HI> given every two, three, or four hours.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this di&s;ea&s;e, there is little doubt but this, like other inflammations, may be carried off by re&s;olution; but if the power and &s;trength of the ve&s;&s;els have been &s;o weakened, or there has been a plentiful depo&s;ition of morbid matter upon the lungs, which has changed the nature of the pulmonary fluids, we mu&s;t then endeavour to promote, by all means, expectoration, as the only remaining means of &s;aving the patient from extreme di&s;tre&s;s, or death.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, added to what we have above delivered, as an attenuant, &s;eneka, or-rattle&s;nake-root, (159.) is e&s;teemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> powerful one, and has in the&s;e ca&s;es been attended with &s;ucce&s;s given three or four times a day; it promotes per&s;piration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> expectoration; but when we find the latter is remi&s;s, expecto|rants mu&s;t be had recour&s;e to, (No. 95.) four &s;poonfuls of which mu&s;t be taken every third or fourth hour.</P>
<P>When people begin to expectorate, &s;ome authors forbid any farther u&s;e of the lancet; <HI>but &s;o long as the violence of the &s;ymp|toms go on to increa&s;e,</HI> we may pur&s;ue it to a fourth or fifth time; nay, indeed, farther, according to the &s;trength, till we find the&s;e alleviated, and the patient perceives him&s;elf con&s;iderably re|lieved.</P>
<P>This alleviation will be perceptible on the fourth or fifth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by the head being freer from unea&s;ine&s;s, the tongue more moi&s;t
<PB N="327" REF="028021_0323_0FD6729FD2A05750">
the cough will be le&s;s trouble&s;ome; the breathing not &s;o difficult; the expectoration more ea&s;y; the matter le&s;s tinged with blood; and by &s;ome alleviation and freedom in the pul&s;e, which will beat more regularly, and with more quietude.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, we &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in the u&s;e of di|luents and expectorants, keeping the body open with gentle ca|thartics, &s;uch as the electarium e ca&s;&s;ia, oil of ca&s;tor, manna, Rochelle &s;alt, &amp;c. (169 to 171.) or by the u&s;e of emollient gly|&s;ters&mdash;de&s;i&s;ting now from farther bleeding.</P>
<P>Though the di&s;ea&s;e in a few days generally terminates favour|ably, if the expectoration continues free and copious, yet &s;ome|times it &s;tops &s;uddenly, and no other di&s;charge &s;ucceeding, the breathing becomes difficult and laborious; we mu&s;t then endea|vour to renew the di&s;charge, le&s;t the patient &s;hould die &s;uffocated, by <HI>bleeding, inhaling warm &s;teams into the lungs, the application of bli&s;ters, and antimonials,</HI> &s;ufficient to promote gentle vomiting.</P>
<P>As the mode of treatment mu&s;t be &s;imilar in the &s;imple inflam|mation of the lungs, heart, media&s;tinum, pericardium, and dia|phragm, (28, 29. 33.) we &s;hall now only de&s;cribe them, to &s;hew how they may be di&s;covered&mdash;and, fir&s;t,</P>

<HEAD>INFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS.</HEAD>
<P>DESCRIPTION. This begins with &s;hivering or chillne&s;s, &s;ucceeded by heat&mdash;after which there comes on anxiety, debili|ty, and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, watchings, and delirium&mdash;the blood drawn is &s;imilar to that in a pleuri&s;y&mdash;be&s;ides, there is a redne&s;s of the countenance and in the eyes&mdash;the tongue is white and dry&mdash;the re&s;piration laborious, quick, and hot, attended with a <HI>dull, not an acute</HI> pain&mdash;the patient cannot lie on the &s;ide affected&mdash;there is a pain in the &s;houlder&mdash;dry cough at fir&s;t, afterwards moi&s;t, and vomiting&mdash;the pul&s;e is full and &s;oft&mdash;the urine high coloured, which, after &s;tanding, &s;ometimes becomes turbid&mdash;at length the mind is di&s;ordered&mdash;the &s;ight fails&mdash;a kind of hi&s;&s;ing noi&s;e attends the breathing&mdash;the pul&s;e rather creeps than beats&mdash;the extremities grow cold&mdash;partial &s;weats breaks out in the &s;u|perior parts&mdash;and death clo&s;es the &s;cene.</P>
<P>Now this complaint is obviou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed from a pleuri&s;y, by the <HI>breath being hot, the pain dull, not acute, and the pul&s;e al&s;o full and &s;oft.</HI></P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing,</HI> (&s;ee page 325.) <HI>Proxi|mate</HI> or <HI>immediate,</HI> inflammatory ob&s;tructions of the terminations of tho&s;e arteries of lungs, (30.) called pulmonary and bronchial, either &s;eparately or conjointly.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="028021_0324_0FD672D381A30970">
CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Febrile affections, attended with an obtu&s;e pain under the brea&s;tbone, or betwixt the &s;houl|ders&mdash;anxiety, and difficulty of breathing&mdash;a cough, generally, though not always, moi&s;t&mdash;the face &s;welled, and of a purpli&s;h colour.</P>
<P>CURE. (See Pleuri&s;y, page 326.) But here it may not be u&s;ele&s;s to ob&s;erve, that there &s;eems to be a material alteration be|tween the termination of an inflammation of the pleura and that of the lungs&mdash;the &s;olution <HI>of the fir&s;t</HI> often happens by a plenti|ful &s;weat, or a copious di&s;charge of loaded urine&mdash;<HI>of the la&s;t,</HI> more frequently by expectoration&mdash;and in both ca&s;es, when the&s;e evacuations of &s;weat, urine, or expectoration have been perfect, a full and &s;alutary cri&s;is is formed, all the oppre&s;&s;ive &s;ymptoms vani&s;h gradually, and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of health happily &s;ucceeds.</P>
<P>The inflammation of the media&s;tinum, which is only a dupli|cature of the pleura, manife&s;ts it&s;elf by an acute pain in the middle of the brea&s;t, between the brea&s;t-bone and the &s;pine, or clavicles or collar-bones, attended with frequent and quick breathing, and the re&s;t of the pleuritic &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>The <HI>inflammation of the heart, and the membrane &s;urrounding the heart,</HI> is accompanied with a deep-&s;eated pain&mdash;weight, anx|iety&mdash;very quick, and frequent re&s;piration&mdash;great thir&s;t&mdash;a heat in the che&s;t&mdash;palpitation of the heart&mdash;with a hard and unequal pul&s;e, and frequent fainting.</P>
<P><HI>The &s;ame affection making the diaphragm, or that part of the pleura which covers it,</HI> (27.) <HI>the &s;eat,</HI> has for its attendant &s;ymp|toms, an acute fever&mdash;re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s&mdash;anxiety&mdash;and delirium&mdash;an acute pain between the &s;purious or &s;hort ribs, and the vertebrae of the back places oppo&s;ite to them, agreeable to its &s;ituation&mdash;the breathing is quick and &s;hort, accompanied with convul&s;ive catchings in in&s;piration&mdash;a dry cough and hiccough&mdash;the hy|pochondrium, or part below the &s;hort ribs is drawn in towards the back, and the abdomen, or lower belly, has little or no mo|tion during the action of breathing.</P>
<P>The three complaints we have now mentioned are called by &s;y&s;tematic writers, CARDITIS, from <HI>cardia,</HI> cor, the heart&mdash;PE|RICARDITIS, from <HI>peri,</HI> circum, about, and <HI>cardia,</HI>&mdash;and PARA|PHRENITIS, in contradi&s;tinction to <HI>phrenitis,</HI> or the inflamma|tion of the brain, becau&s;e, though a delirium always attends it, the brain is only &s;ympathetically affected in this ca&s;e, whil&s;t in the PHRENITIS it is the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the cure, we mu&s;t pur&s;ue the &s;ame plan as ad|vi&s;ed in pleuri&s;y, exerting our &s;tronge&s;t efforts to produce re&s;o|lution, the only &s;alutary termination; for all the other either

bring on immediate death, or lay the foundation for &s;ome irre|mediable complaint, of which we &s;hall treat, as &s;oon as we have taken notice of another &s;pecies of the peripneumony; for in this place we have confined our&s;elves to &s;uch as were purely in|flammatory.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="type of inflammation">
<HEAD>MALIGNANT PERIPNEUMONY.</HEAD>
<P>This complaint is by far more dangerous than that we have before de&s;cribed&mdash;as it generally attacks tho&s;e where humors are in an highly acrimonious &s;tate, &s;corbutic habits, and &s;ailors after long voyages.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. In this complaint, the blood is in a di&s;|&s;olved &s;tate, livid, and when drawn has no coriaceous, or leather-like appearance upon its &s;urface, as in the inflammatory &s;pecies&mdash;there is al&s;o great re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s with extreme debility;&mdash;pains all over the body;&mdash;profu&s;e &s;weats, and red, or livid eruptions, like flea-bites;&mdash;the patients are apt to faint on the lea&s;t mo|tion, have a difficulty of breathing, and cough or &s;pit up a thin, &s;anious, bloody matter, which &s;mells offen&s;ively&mdash;the pul&s;e is &s;oft, and depre&s;&s;ed, and the urine very high coloured.</P>
<P>CURE. The fever attendant on this &s;eems clearly to be of the putrid kind, and as &s;uch mu&s;t be treated&mdash;Bleeding, there|fore, mu&s;t be avoided, without at the beginning the pul&s;e &s;hould be &s;trong, for otherwi&s;e it does great injury, particularly if it &s;hould be repeated. Bli&s;ters al&s;o are mi&s;chievous.&mdash;Our chief dependence re&s;ts upon <HI>vegetable or mineral acids&mdash;camphorated vinegar,</HI> (No. 55.) with a <HI>nouri&s;hing and ace&s;cent diet&mdash;vinous li|quids,</HI> particularly &s;uch as are a&s;tringent, the be&s;t of which are rheni&s;h, claret, and red port&mdash;<HI>Opiates</HI> al&s;o have been found &s;er|viceable in thickening and rendering more mild the thin, acri|monious humours depo&s;ited upon the lungs; but then they &s;hould be given with great caution, taking care not to increa&s;e the difficulty of breathing by their u&s;e.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>&s;purious peripneumony</HI> we &s;hall take notice, when we come to treat on a&s;thma; and now proceed to treat on &s;ome of the con&s;equences of pleuritie and other inflammatory affections of the brea&s;t, forming different di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>For when the pleuri&s;y, or peripneumony is not cured by re|&s;olution, or expectoration, matter is generally formed within the che&s;t, which, according to its &s;ituation, has received differ|ent appellations; when in the body of the lungs, though no more than an ab&s;ce&s;s, it is called VOMICA&mdash;from <HI>vomo,</HI> to vo|mit, becau&s;e they vomit forth, as it were, matter&mdash;when be|tween the pleura, EMPYEMA, from <HI>en</HI> and <HI>puon,</HI> pus, matter.</P>

<P>DESCRIPTION. Upon the formation of matter, which, occurs, if the inflammation goes not off within fourteen days, there is an abatement of the &s;everity of the &s;ymptoms&mdash;the pain cea&s;es&mdash;and the pul&s;e, &s;till quick, is weaker and &s;ofter; yet the cough, difficulty of breathing, and oppre&s;&s;ion &s;till conti|nue&mdash;and if in this &s;ituation the patient feels a &s;light &s;hivering, &s;ucceeded by heat, little doubt remains of an ab&s;ce&s;s taking place;&mdash;add to this, if the cough increa&s;es upon the lea&s;t mo|tion, the patient cannot lie but on the &s;ide affected, and the &s;ymptoms grow daily more &s;evere, accompanied with debility, and emaciation, the&s;e appearances make it more certain&mdash;And &s;hould the vomica bur&s;t &s;uddenly, a &s;uffocation may be dreaded&mdash;or &s;hould the matter not find its way into the branches of the windpipe, &s;o that it may be coughed up, and make its exit out of the habit, all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s are at an end.</P>

<P>CURE. In both the&s;e ca&s;es every pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s de|pends upon freeing the habit from the offen&s;ive matter, which, &s;hould we not be able to accompli&s;h, either the patient will die &s;uffocated&mdash;or con&s;umptive. In an EMPYEMA there are no hopes, except making an aperture between the ribs into the che&s;t, as low as po&s;&s;ible, to avoid wounding the diaphragm.</P>
<P>In a VOMICA, if from the expectoration of matter we have rea&s;on to believe that it has bur&s;t into the branches of the wind|pipe, and the matter be white, &s;mooth, and free from any offen|&s;ive &s;mell, and continue to be freely di&s;charged; if all the op|pre&s;&s;ive &s;ymptoms from day to day abate, particularly the cough and laborious breathing, we mu&s;t not de&s;pair of a recovery, which we mu&s;t endeavour to promote by the u&s;e of expectorant bal&s;amics conveying the &s;teams of the aetherial &s;pirit of vitriol&mdash;or STERNE's aether dropt into hot water, and inhaled into the lungs, in order to clean&s;e and heal the ulcer.</P>

<P>Sometimes an adhe&s;ion will be formed between the mem|brane covering the outer &s;urface of the lungs and the pleura which covers the in&s;ide of the ribs, forming a cavity, and points it&s;elf outwardly; or manife&s;ts it&s;elf by a con&s;tant fixed pain in &s;ome particular part&mdash;under the&s;e circum&s;tances, when all hopes of a cure by expectoration are pa&s;t the vomicae and ulcers have been conquered effectually by an aperture being made into the cy&s;t in which the matter was lodged.

<P>The <HI>proximate</HI> or <HI>immediate</HI> is, <HI>in the fir&s;t &s;tage,</HI> an inflamma|tory &s;tate of &s;ome portions of the lungs, particularly the glandu|lar; <HI>in the &s;econd,</HI> almo&s;t always ulcerations, which the opening of dead bodies who have died of this complaint verify; though &s;ometimes the cau&s;e has been found to be, an induration and &s;welling of the bronchial glands, which are di&s;per&s;ed through the lungs, hard and black, not &s;uppurated in the center, but running together, and firm, of the &s;ize of hazle-nuts or nutmegs, and ooz|ing out a purulent mucus into the terminations and branches of the windpipe, not ob&s;ervable in the &s;pits&mdash;&s;ome of them form

<P>IN THE SECOND STAGE, the indications are, to di&s;charge the offen|&s;ive matter from the con&s;titution by expectoration, or any other mode agreeable to nature, permitting her always to point the way; heal the ulcerations, &s;trengthen the lungs, and give tone and firm|ne&s;s to the habit in general; for which purpo&s;es chalybeate waters, mineral acids, particularly elixir of vitriol, have been recommend|ed; gentle exerci&s;e, e&s;pecially riding on hor&s;eback; a clear, dry, warm air, and &s;uch amu&s;ements and company as will moderate|ly exhilirate, not fatigue the &s;pirits&mdash;venery, all painful mental affections, or too great &s;olicitude about bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hould be a|voided.</P>

<P>DESCRIPTION. In this complaint the GENERAL SYMP|TOMS are, extreme anxiety&mdash;watchings&mdash;re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s&mdash;to&s;&s;ing about of the body&mdash;fainting&mdash;with a <HI>mo&s;t acute fever,</HI> &s;oon ac|companied with nervous and putrid febrile affections&mdash;the LO|CAL; great thir&s;t&mdash;difficulty of breathing&mdash;<HI>pain in the region of the &s;tomach&mdash;exce&s;&s;ive heat, and a &s;en&s;e of burning&mdash;continued painful vomiting&mdash;hiccough, and extreme pain from throwing up of wind, and particularly after taking any &s;harp acrid medicines&mdash;fullne&s;s and ten&s;ion of the &s;tomach</HI>&mdash;the pul&s;e rather hard, con|tracted, and frequent&mdash;with coldne&s;s of the extremities.</P>
<P>CAUSES.

<P>CURE.

can be expected from internal remedies, from the propen&s;ity the &s;tomach has to reject whatever is taken down&mdash;hence all we dare venture upon are demulcents, only moderately warm, &s;uch as &s;olutions of gum arabic, tragacanth, or &s;permaceti, with ni|tre; to which may be added, a very &s;mall portion of camphor, and three or four drops, now and then, of the tincture of opium&mdash;nitre may al&s;o be added to the gly&s;ters, and thrown up freely into the bowels&mdash;flannels al&s;o, &s;oaked in warm &s;olution of nitre, may be applied as a fomentation.</P>
<P>But what we mu&s;t mo&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon mu&s;t be bleeding&mdash;nor mu&s;t we be directed by the pul&s;e, as in this ca&s;e it is apt to de|ceive us, for it is generally &s;mall, quick, and irregular; &s;ome|times intermittent; the operation &s;hould therefore be repeated till the pul&s;e ri&s;es, and beats with &s;ome degree of freedom.</P>
<P>Indeed, if re&s;olution is not accompli&s;hed in the very begin|ning, mortification will very rapidly &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e POISON <HI>&s;hould be the cau&s;e,</HI> at a very early period a quickly acting emetic &s;hould be given, &s;uch as white or blue vitriol, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and afterwards large draughts of new milk, or fre&s;h butter melted, and oil; the&s;e are extremely &s;alu|tary; or any other &s;heathing liquids, drank in &s;uch quantity as to fill the whole alimentary canal, in order to guard the coats of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines from receiving any injury from the acrimony of the poi&s;onous &s;timulus&mdash;when even ar&s;enic has been taken, the&s;e have been found efficacious.</P>

<P>This has not unfrequently been mi&s;taken for in inflammatory lumbago, or pain of the loins; but from which it is di&s;tingui&s;h|able; fir&s;t, from the patient's being able to rai&s;e him&s;elf into an erect po&s;ture; from being bent forwards without any remarka|able pain, which in the lumbago is very &s;evere; from the pain following the cour&s;e of the ureters (50.); from the difficulty of making water, and the urine being more changed, which is not the ca&s;e in the lumbago.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing</HI> are, whatever cau&s;es an irritation in the kidneys, &s;o that the blood is determined too freely and ob&s;tructed there, &s;uch as wounds and brui&s;es&mdash;calcu|lous concretions&mdash;food which generate flatulencies in the bowel, called colon, (43.)&mdash;heating diuretics&mdash;&s;haking in a carriage, or on hor&s;eback&mdash;&s;uppre&s;&s;ed evacuations&mdash;fullne&s;s of blood, or any &s;trong &s;pa&s;modic contractions of the kidneys them&s;elves.</P>

<P>CAUSES. 1&s;t, A too great fullne&s;s of blood&mdash;2d, &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion or retroce&s;&s;ion of the men&s;es or piles&mdash;3d, morbid particles occa&s;ioning intermittents&mdash;4th, from a load on the &s;tomach, and indige&s;tion&mdash;5th, different &s;pecies of acrimony; as that of the pox, gout, rheumati&s;m&mdash;6th, hy&s;teric &s;pa&s;ms&mdash;and, 7th, from latent cau&s;es undi&s;coverable, or irremediable when known&mdash;to each of which in our mode of cure we mu&s;t particularly advert.</P>

<P>We have before &s;poken of the inflammation of the ear, &sect; 2. <HI>in inflammatory complaints;</HI> but there are other cau&s;es which induce this complaint; as, 1&s;t, <HI>worms,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from the eggs of the fle&s;h-fly depo&s;ited in the wax, which form for them a ne&s;t&mdash;2d, <HI>a defluxion of humours</HI>&mdash;3d, <HI>from hard bodies pu&s;hed into the ear.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in&s;tance, &s;moke of tobacco poured into the ear, and afterwards warm oil, prove efficacious.</P>

<P>This complaint is known by a throbbing, gnawing, darting, or &s;ome other &s;pecies of pain in the teeth, attended with watch|ings; &s;ometimes with a &s;welling of the cheek, great di&s;charges of &s;aliva from the mouth, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Its &s;eat is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the nerve creeping over the inter|nal, &s;ometimes the external, membranous covering of the tooth.</P>
<P>CAUSES. 1&s;t, Caries, or decay of the tooth or teeth affect|ed&mdash;2d, an acrid defluxion, or flux of acrimonious humours, as of the &s;curvy, rheumati&s;m, gout, from the ob&s;tructed per&s;pira|tion&mdash;3d. nervous or hy&s;teric affections&mdash;and, 4th, pregnancy.</P>
<P>If it ari&s;es from the FIRST cau&s;e, it is generally perceptible to the &s;ight&mdash;the caries though &s;ometimes lurks between the teeth&mdash;&s;ometimes begins internally, &s;ometimes externally&mdash;however, when it is not perceptible to the eye, it may be di&s;covered by the tooth being almo&s;t pellucid like pearl&mdash;or by the &s;hock of &s;ome metallic in&s;trument, which increa&s;es, or renews the pain&mdash;by a foetid breath&mdash;a &s;harp darting pain from cold water, or cold air received into the mouth&mdash;from a gnawing pain&mdash;from the ob&s;ti|nacy of the di&s;ea&s;e, without any con&s;iderable tumor of the gums&mdash;from &s;i&s;tulous ulcerous gums, having a &s;mall circular tumour round the orifice, and a purulent di&s;charge&mdash;from rotten teeth, ulcerations have been formed, and &s;welling on the chin, and a|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> the cheeks, which are never cured without drawing the tooth.</P>

<P><PB N="350" REF="028021_0346_0FD672EE0B2CD318">
If from the SECOND, it may be di&s;covered by the teeth being in a &s;ound &s;tate&mdash;by the pain not confined to one or two teeth, but the whole jaw of that &s;ide being affected; and by the &s;well|ing of the gums, attended mo&s;t commonly with a copious di&s;|charge of &s;aliva.</P>
<P>CURE. The gums in the beginning &s;hould be &s;carified, or leeches applied; al&s;o mu&s;tard plai&s;ters behind the ears, long e|nough to occa&s;ion a redne&s;s&mdash;or, in more ob&s;tinate ca&s;es, bli&s;ters&mdash;the mouth &s;hould be wa&s;hed with warm milk and water&mdash;and internally, diaphoretics, coupled with &s;edatives, (No. 4 to 10.) &s;hould be given; &s;moaking tobacco, chewing pellitory of Spain, ginger, &s;weet reed, pepper, &amp;c. to cau&s;e a flux of &s;aliva; appli|cations of warm re&s;inous plai&s;ters, (No. 112.) with opium to the temples &s;hould be admini&s;tered; flannels impregnated with the fumes of frankincen&s;e, amber, &s;ugar, &amp;c. applied warm to the cheek, and the mouth wa&s;hed with &s;pirits of wine and camphor.</P>
<P>If by the&s;e means the di&s;ea&s;e is not conquered, which general|ly happens to be the ca&s;e, but the pains per&s;i&s;t, and the gums in|crea&s;e to &s;well, an ab&s;ce&s;s will be mo&s;t likely the con&s;equence; under the&s;e circum&s;tances a roa&s;ted fig &s;hould be kept upon the part to promote &s;uppuration, which once accompli&s;hed, mu&s;t at a proper time be opened, clean&s;ed, and healed, by the applications of pledgets, dipped in a mixture of honey of ro&s;es and tincture of myrrh.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; 4. PAINS IN THE SIDE, OR PLEURODYNES,</HEAD>
<P>from the Greek words <HI>pleuron,</HI> pleura, and <HI>odune,</HI> dolor, pain.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. This di&s;ea&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of pungent pain af|fecting the che&s;t on one &s;ide, attended with difficulty of breath|ing, but without any acute fever, by which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from pleuri&s;y.</P>

<P>If it ari&s;es from the FIRST, it may be di&s;covered by the pain not being deeply &s;eated, but affecting only the interco&s;tal mu&s;|cles,
<PB N="351" REF="028021_0347_0FD672B70B317E68">
(P. 33.) the difficulty of breathing unattended with oppre&s;&s;ion; though accompanied with a cough, &s;till the pul&s;e is unaltered, nor is there any febrile heat; it generally originates from catch|ing cold, or an ob&s;truction of the men&s;es.</P>
<P>CURE. This Nature often performs by a return of the men&s;es, and indeed it will in healthful habits precede their ap|pearance.</P>
<P>If from the FIRST, thin &s;pare diet, gentle diaphoretics, (No. 1. 6 to 10.) and bleeding, are highly &s;erviceable; volatile lini|ments, (No. 107.) mu&s;tard plai&s;ters; warm flannels impregnated with aromatics, or warm water; bags of hot &s;alt, or bladders, applied to the &s;ide, will expedite the cure&mdash;but &s;hould they fail, local bleeding, by cupping, and bli&s;ters to the part affected, we mu&s;t call in aid.</P>
<P>If from the SECOND, there generally attends an erratic fever, but not of the inflammatory cla&s;s&mdash;with a dry cough, pleuritic pain of the &s;ide; and worms are &s;ometimes evacuated&mdash;in the breath there is a particular offen&s;ive &s;mell&mdash;but the&s;e happen chiefly in infants.</P>
<P>CURE. Though one bleeding may be &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary, if the fever runs high, to abate its violence, yet the chief de|pendence is on cathartics, (P. 171, 172, 173.) emetics, (No. 11, 12, 38.) and vermifuges, (197.)&mdash;the purgatives though &s;hould be of the milder cla&s;s.</P>

<P>CURE. Bleeding&mdash;with emollient fomentations, (No. 111.) oily liniments, (No. 107.) and gentle purging, (No. 3. 19 to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">4.)</P>

<P>CURE. The cau&s;e is irremediable, alleviation of the oppre&s;|&s;ive &s;ymptoms is all for which we can hope,&mdash;and this mu&s;t be attended by bleeding, diluent drinks, oily emul&s;ions, or linct u&s;|es, (No. 81 to 84.) emollient decoctions, (142.) gentle &s;edatives and diaphoretics, (No. 4 to 10.) nitrous medicines, (No. 2.) and a thin, &s;pare diet&mdash;and all &s;uch remedies as take off fulne&s;s from the ve&s;&s;els, and render the circulating fluids thin.</P>

<P>CURE. Warm flannels, bladders filled with warm water, or bags of hot &s;alt generally remove the complaint; and it will now and then be nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome nervous tincture, (149, 150.)</P>
<P>But the&s;e pains, or &s;titches, have generally indige&s;tion for their cau&s;e; therefore, to prevent their return, we mu&s;t proceed in the &s;ame manner as we advi&s;e for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the dige&s;tive or|gans in pre&s;erving their functions, &s;ee Dy&s;pep&s;y, and increa&s;ing their power; in order to prevent an accumulation of offen&s;ive matter in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages; or crude chyle from being thrown into the ma&s;s of circulating fluids.</P>

<P>CURE. From con&s;idering the cau&s;es in the fir&s;t five, the in|dications are very nearly &s;imilar, except in the flatulent, to eva|cuate the contents, and &s;o to invigorate the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, that dige&s;tion not only may be properly promoted, but the re|mains, or what is indige&s;tible, may be carried out of the machine regularly by the increa&s;ed power of the inte&s;tines.</P>

<P>Which ever of the&s;e cau&s;es are prevalent, if the habit is co&s;|tive, I clear the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages with &s;ome opening medicine, (No. 108, 109.)</P>
<P>Afterwards wa&s;h the &s;tomach well with warm water and oil&mdash;chamomile flower tea drank plentifully&mdash;or &s;timulate the top of the gullet with a feather, or pre&s;cribe an emetic, (No. 11, 12. 38.)&mdash;if great expedition is requi&s;ite, a few grains of white or blue vitriol, (No. 259.) &s;hould the cau&s;e be mere load from indige&s;tion; the&s;e will be &s;ufficient, giving for a little time a few drops of e|lixir of vitriol in cinnamon tea twice a day; but &s;hould this cir|cum&s;tance often occur, from the debility of the coats of the &s;to|mach, I have recour&s;e to bitter &s;timulants and chalybeates, (No.

<P>If it is of an <HI>acid nature,</HI> magne&s;ia, ab&s;orbent earths, alkalines, or tho&s;e medicines termed antacids, may be applied to (191)&mdash;if <HI>acrid,</HI> the &s;tomach &s;hould be well wa&s;hed with weak chicken broth, or warm water alone; then gentle aperients &s;hould be giv|en, (No. 3. 22 to 24.) and occa&s;ionally per&s;i&s;ted in.</P>
<P>If merely <HI>vi&s;cid,</HI> &s;aponaceous medicines, (No. 109.) are u&s;e|ful.</P>
<P>If rancid, or putrid, the antalkalines; particularly the mineral acids, (190.)</P>
<P>And in all the&s;e ca&s;es the &s;tomach &s;hould be invigorated with &s;timulant bitters, &amp;c. advi&s;ed (353.) and &s;uch mode of living pre&s;cribed as will prevent the generation of the&s;e offen&s;ive ma|terials; avoiding &s;uch viands as are apt to turn acid, alkaline, vi&s;cid, or rancid; and perhaps the only thing we can depend upon for completing the cure, is a cour&s;e of &s;uch mineral wa|ters as upon trial be&s;t &s;uit the con&s;titution, which can only from experiment be a&s;certained.</P>

<P>CURE.

In order to prevent its return, the patient &s;hould ab&s;tain from all food difficult of dige&s;tion; all crude, flatulent, or legu|minous vegetables;&mdash;the body &s;hould be kept open, and a cour&s;e of bitters and chalybeates be per&s;i&s;ted in for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>If <HI>from acrid bile</HI> the pain is extremely acute, accompanied with vomiting of green materials like a leak, or verdigrea&s;e&mdash;&s;ometimes

<P>&s;o called from the colon, (43.) one of the inte&s;tines, being con&s;i|dered as the &s;eat of this complaint.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION IN GENERAL. This is a painful com|plaint of the inte&s;tines, originating from a con&s;triction, or ob|&s;truction in &s;ome part, or parts of them, brought on by &s;ome in|ternal &s;timulus, attended with an acute burning pain of the ab|domen, particularly running round the navel, difficulty of breath|ing, heart-burn, nau&s;ea, or vomiting of a bilious or vi&s;cid mat|ter, co&s;tivene&s;s, the appetite and dige&s;tion weakened&mdash;a di&s;ten|&s;ion and inflation of the lower belly&mdash;thir&s;t&mdash;high-coloured, or yellow urine, often an ob&s;truction in making water&mdash;hiccough&mdash;fainting&mdash;delirium&mdash;convul&s;ions, a rupture of the inte&s;tines, or mortification.</P>

<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Pain of the abdomen, or lower belly, running round the navel, attended with vomiting and co&s;tivene&s;s:</P>
<P>CURE. The indications are, a removal of the con&s;tricting or ob&s;tructing cau&s;e, by taking off the &s;pa&s;ms, and evacuating the irritating matter, from whence they deduce their origin.</P>
<P>We have before treated of the inflammation of the bowels, be|tween which, and the colic attended with local inflammatory &s;ymptoms, &s;ome make a di&s;tinction; this may be &s;y&s;tematically right, but cannot be of any practical utility; for the mode of cure mu&s;t obviou&s;ly be the &s;ame&mdash;though we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the colic with any acute fever, or quick pul&s;e, heat of the whole body, &s;weat, &amp;c. appears only to be a &s;light inflammation of the inte&s;tines from &s;ome local cau&s;e, not producing general inflammatory &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>But the colic pain will &s;ometimes be attended with great de|gree of flatulence, from the air in the bowels being rarefied, and expanding it&s;elf&mdash;hence pain, di&s;ten&s;ion, co&s;tivene&s;s, and rolling of wind in the lower belly&mdash;if the con&s;triction of the bowels continue long, their motion downwards, called peri&s;taltic, will be inverted, and vomiting the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>That it is from wind which occa&s;ions the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ymptom, is very obvious, by the alleviation from pain by the di&s;charge of it downwards; from the pain pur&s;uing the whole tract of the colon, (43.) or running round the lower belly, appearing al&s;o to affect the &s;tomach; but that affection &s;ub&s;iding by the pa&s;&s;ing down of wind, or its change of &s;ituation; on pre&s;&s;ure by being mitigated rather than increa&s;ed; and by not being attended by any remarkable thir&s;t, or alteration of the pul&s;e.</P>
<P>At other times, it will have for its a&s;&s;ociate bilious vomiting, which is difficult to re&s;train; the patient will al&s;o have &s;ome|times a number of bilious &s;tools&mdash;<HI>when vomiting of green-colour|ed matter</HI> is the leading &s;ymptom, the&s;e attend heart-burn, loathing of food, hoar&s;ene&s;s, hiccough, heat, thir&s;t, and bitter|ne&s;s of the mouth&mdash;the urine is high-coloured, and made in &s;mall quantity.</P>
<P>When <HI>bilious &s;tools,</HI> the pain attendant generally affects the whole inte&s;tines, particularly the duodenum, (42.)&mdash;the lower belly is neither ten&s;e nor hot, as in inflammation of the bowels&mdash;the patient is affected with giddine&s;s&mdash;the pul&s;e is quick,

though neither hard nor ten&s;e&mdash;and this di&s;ea&s;e is often &s;ucceed|ed by the jaundice.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e complaints, where the pain is very acute, bleed|ing &s;hould be had recour&s;e to, though no inflammation &s;hould actually exi&s;t, in full habits particularly, very early to prevent that &s;ymptom &s;upervening.&mdash;Emollient oily gly&s;ters, (No. 25, 26.) warm fomentations, friction, and chamomile tea, in &s;light and common ca&s;es, will &s;ubdue the complaint&mdash;but when more ob&s;tinate, chicken water &s;hould be drank plentifully; then gly&s;|ters thrown up occa&s;ionally, and repeated&mdash;if the fir&s;t does not an&s;wer, a &s;econd &s;tronger, (No. 114.)&mdash;&s;hould the&s;e be ineffica|cious, oily purgatives may be tried alone, (No. 66, 99.) or mix|ed with Rochelle &s;alt, and continued till a free evacuation is produced&mdash;ca&s;tor oil is the mo&s;t efficacious, as it often alleviates pain before it procures any evacuation, which it al&s;o does very quickly.</P>
<P>Sometimes liquids will be rejected, purgatives then in a &s;olid form mu&s;t be tried, (No. 115.) and continued every hour till the wi&s;hed-for effect occurs&mdash;but &s;hould the attendant pain be ex|tremely &s;evere, with cathartics we may couple opiates; or &s;eda|tive medicines may be given fir&s;t, and a &s;mall time afterwards, purgatives&mdash;by the&s;e means &s;ometimes the gentler purgatives will an&s;wer every purpo&s;e&mdash;bags filled with &s;alt, oats, boiled bran, or water made hot, may be applied to the belly.</P>
<P>But &s;hould there be any &s;u&s;picion of inflammation, the &s;trong|er &s;timulant cathartics mu&s;t be avoided&mdash;the Ep&s;om &s;alt &s;olu|tion, (No. 97.) is preferable to other purgatives; for, diffused in that way, it is always plea&s;ant, and gentle in its operation.</P>
<P>We &s;hould always inquire in the&s;e ca&s;es, whether there be any rupture; for, from the &s;trangulation of the inte&s;tines pu&s;hed out into the &s;ac externally, this complaint &s;ometimes ari&s;es.</P>
<P>In order to &s;top the vomiting, the &s;aline draught in a &s;tate of fermentation (No. 59.) &s;hould be tried&mdash;&s;edative gly&s;ters, (No. 116.) and plai&s;ters of mithridate, may be applied to the &s;tomach&mdash;leaves of common garden mint, boiled in port, and laid on the pit of the &s;tomach and wri&s;ts, have been found &s;ometimes &s;upe|rior to every other application.</P>
<P>Should there be any appearance of bile copiou&s;ly di&s;charged, &s;oftening gly&s;ters, &s;uch as decoction of lin&s;eed and mar&s;h-mal|lows, with oil, &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> recour&s;e to&mdash;acidulated drinks al&s;o, with lemon or orange juice, vinegar, apple-water, &amp;c. chicken-water, &s;edative emul&s;ions, (No. 81. 83.) to which may be added thirty or forty drops of the tincture of opium, if the pain is vio|lent&mdash;and the patient &s;hould be put into a warm bath, and re|main in it &s;o long as he can bear it without di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<P>CAUSES.

<P>CURE. Before the complaint is confirmed, in the beginning, &s;ucce&s;s may be expected from the application of &s;uch gly&s;ters as were before pre&s;cribed, (No. 25. 26.) adding to them ca&s;tor oil, and keeping the body open with emul&s;ions of the &s;ame oil, (No. 66.) with which two or three ounces of tincture of &s;enna may be mixed.</P>
<P>Cold mu&s;t be avoided, and a very light ea&s;ily dige&s;tible diet &s;trictly adhered to.</P>
<P>But in the more advanced &s;tage, where there is generally a vomiting of green bile, <HI>the di&s;charge is to be encouraged</HI> by drink|ing freely of thin weak broth&mdash;<HI>the hardened excrements evacuated by repeated gly&s;ters&mdash;an alleviation of pain procured</HI> by more than common do&s;es of opium, (152.) and the&s;e repeated&mdash;the belly mu&s;t be fomented with warm fomentations, (No. 85. 111.)&mdash;warm bathing partially u&s;ed&mdash;and the umbilical region bli&s;ter|ed.</P>

<P>In Charle&s;town they adopt the following &s;cheme:</P>

<P>Bath water, and chalybeate &s;prings in general, are beneficial and proper to prevent a relap&s;e.</P>

<P>In habits full of blood, in any of the&s;e complaints, bleeding may be had recour&s;e to, le&s;t inflammation &s;hould be the con&s;e|quence of the violence or long continuance of the pain.</P>

<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. A fixed pain in the region of the kidneys and ureters, unattended with any acute fever, &s;uch as accompanies the inflammation of the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>CURE. The indications are, to abate the unea&s;y &s;ymptoms, by taking off the &s;pa&s;modic affection of, &s;heathing and relaxing the parts, and facilitating the progre&s;s of the offending cau&s;e, that it may be evacuated&mdash;which purpo&s;es will be promoted by bleeding, emollient and demulcent decoctions drank plentifully, &s;edatives, chiefly opiates, oily emul&s;ions, and mild aperients, &amp;c.

<HEAD>STONE IN THE BLADDER, or LITHIASIS,</HEAD>

<P>DESCRIPTION. In this di&s;ea&s;e, there is generally a pain in the bladder, e&s;pecially about its neck, and oftentimes bloody u|rine after riding on hor&s;eback, on being jolted much in a carri|age, a &s;en&s;e of weight in the perineum, or part immediately be|fore the anus, with an itching of the glans penis, (55.) a &s;limy &s;ediment in the urine, and frequent &s;toppages in making wa|ter.</P>
<P>But if the &s;tone &s;hould be &s;mooth, of a round form, it may lie a con&s;iderable time before it is perceptible to the patient, till by its increa&s;e of weight, acquired by acce&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h matter, it creates unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations&mdash;but &s;hould it be angular, or have a rugged &s;urface, yet &s;mall in &s;ize, it generally occa&s;ions pain and bloody urine, or a di&s;charge of &s;limy fluid, with a fruitle&s;s effort to go to &s;tool, called <HI>tene&s;mus,</HI> and difficulty of making water.</P>

<P>The FIRST may ari&s;e from inflammation of the kidneys, or a &s;tone, and becomes a &s;ymptom, and then mu&s;t be cured as ad|vi&s;ed in ca&s;es of nephritis, (342.) and nephralgia, (364.) but &s;ome|times it derives its origin from mucus thrown into the ve&s;&s;els of the kidneys, (48.) in &s;uch a degree as to hinder almo&s;t the to|tal &s;ecretion of urine.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. In this ca&s;e there is generally a &s;mall quantity of turbid urine made, without any pain of the region below the navel, or &s;welling over the bone at the lower part of the belly, called os pubis, or any &s;igns of the &s;tone or gravel but a dull, heavy pain over the loins; and this happens in con|&s;titutions which are generally phlegmatic, (60.) mucous di&s;|ea&s;es having preceded, and urine before made loaded with mu|cus.</P>

Stimulating diuretics, (175, 176.) &s;uch as mu&s;tard, hor&s;e-radi&s;h, with &s;quills; al&s;o &s;oap, (177.) in order to clear a|way the mucus, free the urinary ve&s;&s;els, leave at liberty and &s;o|licit the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els of the kidneys to perform their office; for in the&s;e ca&s;es we find little or no urine comes into the blad|der.

<P>When the urine is retained in the bladder, we ob&s;erve a &s;well|ing of the lowe&s;t part of the belly above the bone &s;ituated at the bottom, attended with pain, and often a &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s, and pre&s;&s;ure at the neck of the bladder.</P>

<P>CAUSES.

<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is by no means dangerous, and terminates in the &s;ame manner as do other local inflammations, <HI>though extremely rarely in mortification.</HI></P>

<P>CAUSES. <HI>The remote,</HI> or <HI>inducing,</HI> are, an expo&s;ure to cold &s;uddenly whil&s;t hot, too great lo&s;s of blood, or &s;evere purging, hard drinking, immoderate venery, indige&s;tion, a vitiated &s;tate of the fluids from other di&s;ea&s;es, a too great fullne&s;s from evacu|ations &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and often from quick changes of the weather. The lumbago will al&s;o be brought on by lifting too heavy weights, in habits di&s;po&s;ed to rheumatic affections.</P>
<P>The <HI>proximate,</HI> or <HI>immediate,</HI> have been &s;uppo&s;ed to be a vi&s;|cid acrimonious &s;erum ob&s;tructing the &s;erous and lymphatic ve&s;|&s;els of the mu&s;cles, but particularly of the membranes, or li|gaments; or rather a peculiar acrimony, electively affecting the larger joints, membranes, and tendons of the mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. This di&s;ea&s;e ari&s;es from an external, and, for the mo&s;t part, from an evident cau&s;e, attended with pain about the joints, following the cour&s;e of the mu&s;cles, affecting the knees and the larger joints rather than tho&s;e of the hands and feet; &s;ometimes the hip mu&s;cles, and vertebrae of the loins: frequently having febrile affections for its a&s;&s;ociate, &s;ome|times not.</P>
<P>CURE. When it is attended with febrile &s;ymptoms, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to bleeding, and that repeated according to the &s;trength of the patient, and violence of the inflammatory affec|tion; and two drams of nitre di&s;&s;olved in a quart of water gru|el &s;weetened with honey, and acidulated with lemon juice, forms not an inefficacious remedy, giving a tea-cupful every &s;econd hour, throwing up occa&s;ionally gly&s;ters, or giving occa&s;ionally cooling purges, to keep the body open, (P. 171, 172. or No. 3. 22, 23, 24.)&mdash;to the nitre may be added one-eighth of a grain of tartari&s;ed antimony in each do&s;e, or to the purgatives.</P>
<P>Or the antimonial nitrated powder, (No. 125.) with the vola|tile &s;aline mixture, may be given every five or &s;ix hours, (No. 126) adding two or three grains of the powder to the night do&s;e.</P>
<P>Should the&s;e not keep the body open, gly&s;ters may be given, or aperients added to the powder or mixture.</P>
<P>The&s;e generally abate the febrile &s;ymptoms, mitigate the pain,
<PB N="371" REF="028021_0367_0FD6730019C002B0">
and evacuate the acrimony, by keeping up a continued, gentle per&s;piration.</P>
<P>When the di&s;ea&s;e is on the decline, the rapidity of the fever and the violence of the pain are abated, <HI>not before</HI>&mdash;&s;teams of warm water may be conveyed to the parts affected, or friction if the parts can bear it, or liniment of water of acetated ammonia, and oil may be rubbed warm into, and a flannel worn over the part.</P>
<P>After &s;ufficient bleeding, and emptying the inte&s;tines, partial or general warm baths have been found to give great relief; and our patients &s;hould u&s;e the &s;ame &s;ort of diet as recommended in inflammatory fever, (212. to 214.) but when all the febrile &s;ymp|toms begin to abate, mu&s;tard whey, (No. 127.) will be an u&s;eful drink.</P>
<P>Now from experience we find, though the cri&s;is of this com|plaint happens either <HI>by &s;weat,</HI> or <HI>urine</HI> dropping a yellow &s;edi|ment, <HI>loo&s;ene&s;s,</HI> or depo&s;iting an humor upon the exterior &s;urface, particularly the legs&mdash;&s;till it is be&s;t conveyed out of the ma|chine by the pores of the &s;kin&mdash;hence a cour&s;e of diaphoretics are advi&s;ed, and the patient ordered to lie in blankets in prefer|ence to linen, in order to add to their efficacy.</P>
<P>When the pain goes off, and the fever &s;ub&s;ides, the diet &s;hould be more &s;ub&s;tantial; and with intent to clear the con&s;titution as perfectly as po&s;&s;ible from the remains of the offending cau&s;e, a decoction &s;hould be taken of diaphoretic woods, (No. 88.) or the compound decoction of &s;ar&s;aparilla&mdash;&s;hould ulcers happen upon the legs; they &s;hould not be dried up too &s;oon, for fear of imprudently repelling the humour to &s;ome internal part, which might prove more dangerous.</P>
<P>But &s;ometimes, after the febrile affections are totally gone off, the pain &s;till continues, and here we mu&s;t labour to attenuate and throw out the acrimony which creates the painful affections, by a cour&s;e of gentle diaphoretics&mdash;&s;uch as compound powder of ipecacuanha&mdash;or antimonials (230.) joined with opiates, in order that re&s;t may be procured, and the patient's &s;trength &s;up|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>Stimulants are here al&s;o required, as tincture of guaiac, 30 or 40 drops upon &s;ugar, and mixed with peppermint water, three or four times a day, or gum guaiac, made into a draught, with 30 or 40 drops of &s;ome volatile &s;pirit, (No. 128.) or gum guaiac, and quick lime, equal quantities, well rubbed together&mdash;then lime water poured on, and when it has &s;tood &s;ome time, decant the limpid part&mdash;to this add a few drops of any volatile &s;pirit and it will mix with water without &s;eparation&mdash;&s;ometimes there will appear an intermi&s;&s;ion in the pains; and where, at the on|&s;et
<PB N="372" REF="028021_0368_0FD67339178D57B8">
of the di&s;ea&s;e, there have been profu&s;e di&s;charges by the &s;kin, with a copious depo&s;ition in the urine;&mdash;bark 193, (194.) is highly &s;erviceable, united with volatile tincture of guaiacum, (180) and has been known to relieve very ob&s;tinate ca&s;es, par|ticularly in debilitated habits.</P>
<P>The CHRONIC RHEUMATISM chiefly affects old men, or tho&s;e who by indi&s;cretions have &s;o weakened their con&s;titutions, that they are reduced to that &s;tandard. The attack of this is not &s;o general, &s;eldom affecting &s;o many places at once; nor do the parts appear &s;o red or &s;welled&mdash;it returns at intervals, without any fe|brile affections almo&s;t, or &s;weat&mdash;and there are &s;ometimes tu|mors of the colour of the &s;kin, or very &s;lightly red, ri&s;ing in dif|ferent parts, rather round, of the &s;ize of a nut, affecting chief|ly tho&s;e of full habits, and women who have nor their men|&s;es.</P>
<P>In full habits bleeding may be had recour&s;e to <HI>once</HI>&mdash;bli&s;ters and &s;udorifics are more u&s;eful&mdash;repeated purging expedites the cure.</P>
<P>Mercurials, joined with diophorets (No. 87.) are extremely efficacious&mdash;and al&s;o the addition of gum guaiacum to purga|tives, (No. 19, 20.)&mdash;guaiacum given from day to day, &s;o as to procure two or three &s;tools every day, has been often attended with &s;ucce&s;s; or on the nights previous to giving a purge (No. 19, 20 21.) in the morning, calomel joined with guaiacum has been of great u&s;e, (No. 129.)&mdash;when the pain is excruciating, opiates (151.) may be given at night.</P>
<P>Volatiles, and opiates externally applied, are often attended with &s;alutary effects, (No. 107.) or &s;timulating plai&s;ter, (No. 130.) &s;ufficient to create proper irritation over the part affect|ed.</P>
<P>Oil of turpentine has been &s;poken of as an internal as well as external remedy, (No. 122.)</P>
<P>Electricity has been recommended for 15 days, a quarter of an hour each day, drawing the &s;parks through the parts affected, and giving a few general &s;hocks.</P>
<P>In order to prevent relap&s;es, a flannel &s;hirt &s;hould be worn next to the &s;kin; compound decoction of &s;ar&s;aparilla with milk taken for a month; now and then the warm bath &s;hould be had recour&s;e to, and at the proper &s;ea&s;on &s;ea-bathing.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e modes will be &s;ufficient in common ca&s;es; but in &s;uch as are more ob&s;tinate, change of climate is very often requi&s;ite, and al&s;o the natural hot baths&mdash;or in per&s;ons who&s;e va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem acts with freedom, nothing is more conducive to prevent it return than cold bathing.</P>

<P>&s;o called from the French word <HI>goutte,</HI> an acrid defluxion&mdash;in medical language it is called ARTHRITIS by many, from <HI>an|thron,</HI> articulus, a joint, becau&s;e it affects the joints&mdash;by &s;ome PODAGRA, from <HI>pous,</HI> pes, the feet, and <HI>agra,</HI> captura, &s;eizure, becau&s;e they con&s;ider the feet as its natural &s;eat&mdash;and though it is thought, that there is truly only one &s;pecies, yet, according to the different appearances it puts on, it has been di&s;tingui&s;hed&mdash;all which may very properly come under two heads&mdash;the REGU|LAR, or FIXED&mdash;the IRREGULAR, or UNCERTAIN, GOUT, re&s;|pecting the &s;eat it occupies&mdash;both tho&s;e &s;pecies, which we &s;hall proceed to de&s;cribe, appear to depend upon the &s;trength or weakne&s;s of the whole, or &s;ome part or parts of the con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. Before the fit comes on, the patients mo&s;t commonly experience a general la&s;&s;itude and wearine&s;s&mdash;are low-&s;pirited&mdash;complain of a load and fullne&s;s of the &s;tomach after eating&mdash;are &s;queami&s;h very often, and throw up wind&mdash;the belly is di&s;tended with flatulence&mdash;the habit co&s;tive, the &s;weating or moi&s;ture of the feet goes off, and the veins there appear full.</P>
<P>After the&s;e an acute pain for the mo&s;t part &s;eizes the joint of the great toe, accompanied with a &s;en&s;e of coldne&s;s, as if cold water was poured down&mdash;&s;light &s;hiverings, and other febrile af|fections&mdash;a &s;hooting, gnawing, pungent, or burning pain, &s;eizes the &s;mall bones of the foot, or they feel as if &s;queezed &s;trongly with the hand&mdash;in about twenty four hours, the part begins to look red, and &s;well&mdash;a gentle breathing &s;weat comes on, and then the pain begins to decrea&s;e, and the fever di&s;appears.</P>
<P>In the morning patients find them&s;elves better, in the evening wor&s;e, becau&s;e at that time the fit comes on&mdash;during the fit men become ira&s;cible, and are ea&s;ily irritated&mdash;they have little or no appetite&mdash;the body is co&s;tive; and a painful &s;en&s;ation of the part accompanies the whole fit&mdash;on the fir&s;t days the urine is high-coloured, and di&s;covers a brick-coloured or red &s;andy &s;edi|ment.</P>
<P>In proportion as the con&s;titution is &s;tronger or weaker, &s;o does the fit go off quicker or &s;lower; at which time an intoler|able

itching is perceived between the toes, and the &s;carf &s;kin falls off in &s;cales like bran,&mdash;the joints feel &s;tiff as if they were covered with plai&s;ters and dry, and a period is put to the di&s;ea&s;e for &s;ome time&mdash;which again returns.</P>
<P>This is the ca&s;e of the gout in its fir&s;t attacks, &s;o long as the con&s;titution pre&s;erves a proper degree of power; but in proce&s;s of time, as the habit becomes weaker, the complaint takes deep|er root, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;eizes the hands, wri&s;ts, elbows, knees, and other parts&mdash;hard chalky tumours are formed, and the di&s;torted limbs lo&s;e all motion. At this period the fits continue almo&s;t the whole year, and the afflicted make large quantities of pale u|rine; they are al&s;o tormented with piles, putrid eructations, &s;pa&s;modic affections, &s;tony concretions in the kidneys, gravelly complaints, and lo&s;e all appetite.</P>
<P>The &s;trength of the con&s;titution &s;till failing more and more, till it becomes almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, the gouty matter, incapable of being thrown out upon the extremities, affects the internal parts of the &s;y&s;tem, and produces complaints peculiar to tho&s;e parts from the &s;timulus it there occa&s;ions&mdash;<HI>&s;ometimes upon the head,</HI> producing apoplexy, lethargy, pal&s;y, delirium, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and u|niver&s;al convul&s;ions&mdash;<HI>&s;ometimes upon the membranes of the che&s;t</HI> occa&s;ioning pleuri&s;y&mdash;<HI>or on the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines,</HI> whence in|ternal unea&s;ine&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;ickne&s;s, vomiting, loo&s;ene&s;s&mdash;during the continuance of the&s;e affections, there is no pain in a|ny part, otherwi&s;e it generally exerts it&s;elf&mdash;at length, the con|&s;titution being worn out, and having lo&s;t all its power, the vital parts, as the brain, lungs, and heart, begin to be depre&s;&s;ed, and the machine falls a &s;acrifice to its own weakne&s;s, and the vio|lence of the morbid affection.</P>
<P>This de&s;cription comprehends the gout in both its forms of regularity or irregularity&mdash;it being con&s;idered THE REGULAR GOUT, when it fixes upon <HI>the feet,</HI> and is attended with a &s;uffici|ent &s;trong inflammation, continuing for &s;ome days, and gradual|ly going off, with &s;welling, itching, and peeling of the &s;carf-&s;kin, in form of &s;cales, like bran.</P>
<P>THE IRREGULAR, when it attacks other places, and is attend|ed with internal debility of the &s;tomach, or other parts; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> has &s;lightly affected the joints, and receded, or has not at|tacked them, but produces inflammation on &s;ome internal part.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing</HI> are, full, free, luxurious living&mdash;hard drinking, particularly acid and rough wines&mdash;in|dolence, or the omi&s;&s;ion of accu&s;tomary exerci&s;e&mdash;relaxed, &s;oft, and full habit&mdash;immoderate venery in youth&mdash;too &s;udden chang|ing from di&s;tilled liquors o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;pirits, to tho&s;e which are thin
<PB N="375" REF="028021_0371_0FD67302EF36FD88">
and watery&mdash;&s;uppre&s;&s;ed evacuations&mdash;and an hereditary taint.</P>
<P>It &s;eldom attacks boys, ca&s;tratas, or women, except viragos, or &s;uch as have pa&s;&s;ed the time of having the men&s;es; but mo&s;t commonly men in the decline of life, tho&s;e of lively imagina|tions, the &s;tudious living a &s;edentary life, and &s;itting up late at night.</P>
<P>The <HI>proximate</HI> or <HI>immediate</HI> CAUSE is, a peculiar humour elec|tively fixing in common upon the &s;mall joints, or rather thin ligaments; or, perhaps, upon the membranous coverings of the nerves, there &s;ituated; or &s;ometimes in other parts of the ma|chine, particularly tho&s;e which are the mo&s;t irritable.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. A di&s;ea&s;e accruing without any evident external cau&s;e; but having, for the mo&s;t part, an unaccu&s;tomary affection of the &s;tomach preceding the attack, and al&s;o febrile &s;ymptoms&mdash;a pain in the joints, and that mo&s;t fre|quently of the great toe, but <HI>certainly</HI> attacking chiefly the joints of the hands and feet&mdash;this pain returns at intervals, and of|ten alternates with affections of the &s;tomach and other internal parts.</P>
<P>Though we allow of two &s;pecies of the gout, yet it is pretty obvious, that they depend only upon the different proportions of &s;trength in the con&s;titution;&mdash;and this will regulate our con|duct in the mode of</P>
<P>CURE; and here are indicated a &s;eparation and expul&s;ion of the morbid matter, and a prevention of its return, or capability of reproducing its morbid effects&mdash;in all which we mu&s;t be go|verned by the con&s;titution. When the gout proceeds regularly, and fixes in the feet, patience and warm flannels are recommend|ed&mdash;and the free u&s;e of wine allowed, under the idea of making the depo&s;ition of the gouty matter more complete, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the local expul&s;ion.</P>
<P>However, in the mo&s;t &s;imple and regular ca&s;es, I do not re|commend a total prohibition of all medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance; nor can I think that large draughts of wine, and loads of flannel, can com|pen&s;ate for the lo&s;s of <HI>judicious</HI> advice; for to me, who frequent|ly have experienced the gout, it is clear, that &s;ome things may be done without any ri&s;que of pre&s;ent danger, or future mi&s;|chief, which render the fit oftentimes le&s;s violent, &s;horten its continuance, and obviate the con&s;equent debility; for I am per|&s;uaded, we &s;uffer more from con&s;titutional defects,&mdash;the effects of &s;ymptoms,&mdash;and mi&s;management, than from the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf, particularly in tho&s;e who labour under recent at|tacks&mdash;&s;imilar in&s;tances we have &s;een in the treatment of other di&s;ea&s;es; as in the &s;mall-pox, where warmth and cordials were in&s;tituted for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, of throwing off the morbid mat|ter
<PB N="376" REF="028021_0372_0FD6733C1DEA10D8">
by which the fever was too highly increa&s;ed, and de&s;truction too often, and danger always the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee who are the men mo&s;t &s;ubject to this malady&mdash;hard drinkers, particularly wine-bibbers&mdash;men of voracious appetites, who feed on high-&s;ea&s;oned di&s;hes&mdash;venereal devotees&mdash;men of lively imaginations, and tho&s;e addicted to &s;evere &s;tudy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hours, and good living; and, in &s;hort, mo&s;t of tho&s;e who, by va|rious means, weaken their dige&s;tive powers&mdash;if the&s;e have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gout in their habit, they &s;eldom e&s;cape; if not, commonly ac|quire it from their own indi&s;cretion.</P>

<P>Diluent cordials, wine and water, &s;age, balm or mint tea, may be freely drank, and anti&s;pa&s;modics, diaphoretics, and antimo|nials, joined with camphor and volatiles, (No. 131.) may be ta|ken&mdash;if the pain &s;hould be exce&s;&s;ive, not otherwi&s;e, gentle opiates may be added&mdash;aethereal &s;pirit of vitriol, water of acetated am|monia, with aromatic confection, and aethereal &s;pirit of nitre; the&s;e will promote per&s;piration, and increa&s;e the urinary di&s;|charge.</P>
<P>The body &s;hould al&s;o be kept open with &s;mall do&s;es of rhu|barb, ca&s;tor oil, manna, lenitive electuary, and gly&s;ters occa&s;i|onally, if nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

may be, I would advi&s;e u&s;ing the joint affected during the fit repeatedly; for that prevents the too great relaxation of the li|gaments from the flux and &s;tagnation of fluids in the&s;e ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means may this painful di&s;ea&s;e be mitigated, or the painful con&s;equences often &s;ubdued, and always made le&s;s &s;e|vere; but if we would attempt the cure, we mu&s;t try that in the periods where there is &s;ome long intermi&s;&s;ions; and this by the preventive plan, (62. 97.) to which regimen there point|ed out, &s;tomachic and aromatic bitters &s;hould be occa&s;ionally taken, &s;uch as qua&s;&s;ia wood, (175.) or bark mixed with &s;teel, (No. 61 to 65.) chalybeate waters, particularly tho&s;e of Bath&mdash;the &s;kin &s;hould be kept clean, and a flannel &s;hirt worn next to it&mdash;a do&s;e of tincture of rhubarb, (173.) &s;hould be taken twice a day;&mdash;and, in fine, &s;uch things occa&s;ionally applied to; as will contribute to &s;trengthen the &s;tomach and dige&s;tive powers, keep up a free &s;tate of per&s;piration, and prevent the body from being co&s;tive.</P>
<P>Should the&s;e things fail, our la&s;t re&s;ort mu&s;t be a milk diet, and that con&s;tantly per&s;i&s;ted in; though this will only &s;uit &s;uch as have a pretty &s;trong &s;tamina: the weak and very debilitated would probably fall a &s;acrifice to the change.</P>
<P>When the GOUT a&s;&s;umes its IRREGULAR FORM, we conclude it is owing to the weakened &s;tate of the moving powers, not being able to throw the offending matter to the extremities, or, when there depo&s;ited, of not keeping it in that &s;ituation&mdash;and hence the head, lungs, &s;tomach, kidneys, bladder, come to be affected, becau&s;e they po&s;&s;e&s;s more &s;en&s;ibility, and are more ir|ritable than other of the internal parts&mdash;however, when it fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> on the&s;e parts, it is extremely hazardous, in proportion to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> degree of violence&mdash;we, therefore, as expeditiou&s;ly as we can &s;hould labour to throw it out of the habit into the extremities, particularly into the feet.</P>
<P>Now, if the HEAD and LUNGS are affected, and the habit full of blood, we mu&s;t bleed in proportion to the &s;trength and full|ne&s;s&mdash;afterwards apply bli&s;ters to the in&s;ide of the thighs and legs&mdash;bathe the feet in decoctions of hor&s;e-raddi&s;h and brui&s;ed mu&s;tard-&s;eed&mdash;&s;ome advi&s;e wine, or &s;ome other &s;pirituous men|&s;truum&mdash;&s;inapi&s;ms (No. 30.) may al&s;o be applied to the feet&mdash;and we &s;hould give volatile camphorated medicines, (No. 33. 35 to 37) and with cordials, (No. 13 to 18. 28 to 30.) to in|crea&s;e the motion of the blood, at the &s;ame time that it is &s;oli|cited to the extreme parts.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the STOMACH be the &s;eat, vomiting will often be &s;o violent, as to reject almo&s;t every thing which is taken; in or|der to allay this, we mu&s;t depend upon cordials, as above, uni|ted

<HEAD>SECTION XV. MORBID EVACUATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>WE mu&s;t now proceed to treat of tho&s;e di&s;orders who&s;e mo&s;t &s;triking &s;ymptom is &s;ome evacuation, which is ei|ther not natural, exceeds the limits, or returns at more frequent periods, than what is u&s;ual in a &s;4tate of health.</P>
<P>The&s;e may be properly divided into &s;uch evacuations as flow from the bowels, called ALVINE, from <HI>alvus,</HI> the belly&mdash;SAN|GUINARY, from &s;anguis, the blood&mdash;called HAEMORRHAGES, from <HI>aima,</HI> &s;anguis, and <HI>reo,</HI> fluo, to flow&mdash;and SEROUS, from &s;e|rum, or the thinner fluids, as lymph, urine, mucus, &s;weat, and &s;imilar fluids.</P>
<P>Now all the&s;e evacuations are either ACTIVE or PASSIVE, &s;imilar to what we have &s;aid on inflammation. (298. 305.)&mdash;when they are ACTIVE, they are &s;olicited by &s;ome morbid &s;ti|mulus, or medicines by which the excretory ve&s;&s;els of the parts affected are put into &s;tronger action, and throw out their con|tents too copiou&s;ly, or the ve&s;&s;els bur&s;t, and from thence is the evacuation produced&mdash;when PASSIVE, the proper powers of the living machine do not excite, but become defective in re&s;i&s;tance, as in ca&s;es, of a con&s;tant flux of urine from the relaxation of the &s;phincter of the bladder. (51.)</P>
<P>Of the&s;e truths we &s;hall be convinced, if we con&s;ider, that all the fluids of the human machine are contained in different re|ceptacles, as bile, urine, &amp;c. and al&s;o that part of them are kept in perpetual motion, as the blood, &amp;c. part of them &s;ecre|ted and excreted; &s;ome of which &s;ecretions flow out of the body in regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as the matter of per&s;piration; &s;ome are re|tained for a time, till nature calls them into motion for particu|lar purpo&s;es, as milk, &s;emen, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It will therefore appear obvious, that whenever the force of the impelled fluid, or the weight of it, when collected, is too powerful for the natural &s;trength of the ve&s;&s;els or cavities, the ve&s;&s;els which bur&s;t, or the &s;phincters by which they are guarded, and prevented from pouring out their contents, be opened; hence, when either the expul&s;ive force of the contained liquid is too great, and the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;els too much weakened; or when the fluids are in too great quantity, and the &s;phincters in too relaxed a &s;tate, the rupture of the one, the want of contract|ile power of the other, will nece&s;&s;arily lay the foundation for the di&s;ea&s;e; &s;o that it may ari&s;e either from an increa&s;e of the expul&s;ive and decrea&s;e of two re&s;i&s;ting power, or from them both

happening conjointly in the &s;ame habit, and at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The indications of cure will then be, in ACTIVE EVACUATI|ONS, to attempt to remove the morbid &s;timulus, and weaken the powers of the ve&s;&s;els or cavities&mdash;in the PASSIVE, to &s;trengthen the ve&s;&s;els or cavities, and give power to the &s;phincters, that they may act with proper force.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="disease">
<HEAD>&sect; 1. CHOLERA MORBUS, OR BILIOUS, VOMITING AND INTES|TINAL FLUX.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;eat of this complaint &s;eems to be the whole inte&s;tinal canal, particularly the &s;tomach, head of the duodenum, (42.) and doctus communis choledochus, the common duct of the gall bladder. (36.)</P>
<P>And it is apt chiefly to attack &s;uch as are of bilious, dry, choleric habits, or who&s;e con&s;titutions are loaded with &s;corbutic acrimony, or the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages with acid humours, or are of ira&s;cible di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. Though this di&s;ea&s;e will &s;ometimes come on very &s;uddenly, it is often preceded by heart-burn, a gnawing painful &s;en&s;ation of the &s;tomach and bowels, and rancid eructa|tions&mdash;after which &s;ucceed enormous vomitings, and inte&s;tinal di&s;charges of vitiated humours, bilious, green, yellow, and &s;ometimes black, with great difficulty and pain&mdash;there is al&s;o a violent pain and di&s;tention of the belly and inte&s;tines, accom|panied with thir&s;t&mdash;a pul&s;e at fir&s;t full, &s;trong, and frequent, afterwards weak and irregular&mdash;heat, and anxiety&mdash;moreover there attends a nau&s;ea extremely trouble&s;ome&mdash;&s;ometimes a contraction of the legs and arms&mdash;an acute pain above the navel&mdash;retention of the urine&mdash;fainting&mdash;coldne&s;s of the extremities&mdash;the body becomes weak, and the &s;pirits low&mdash;with other &s;ymptoms of a &s;imilar nature, which greatly terrify the atten|dants, and will de&s;troy the patient in forty-eight hours.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e generally makes its appearance in autumn, more e&s;pecially after a hot and dry &s;ummer.</P>
<P>If the di&s;ea&s;e is more than commonly violent, the evacuations downwards are very numerous, amounting in the &s;pace of a few hours to ninety or a hundred&mdash;the patients &s;oon become e|maciated and reduced&mdash;and the &s;ymptoms above &s;pecified are quickly followed by hiccough&mdash;univer&s;al convul&s;ions&mdash;cold

&s;weats&mdash;frequent &s;woonings&mdash;and either in one of the&s;e fits, or in a convul&s;ed &s;tate, when the di&s;ea&s;e proves fatal, they expire.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing</HI> are, eating of pork, ba|con, fat meat fried in oil or butter&mdash;or &s;weets, grapes, cherries, cucumbers, melons, or all &s;uch viands as become readily rancid or acid&mdash;poi&s;ons&mdash;&s;trong purgatives&mdash;violent rage&mdash;and acrimo|nious bile.</P>
<P>The <HI>proximate</HI> or <HI>immediate,</HI> con&s;trictions of the &s;tomach and &s;mall inte&s;tines, particularly the duodenum, by bilious or acri|monious humours irritating and vellicating the &s;en&s;ible nervous coats, which cau&s;e an increa&s;e of action in the&s;e organs, produc|ing different &s;ymptoms, according to the parts locally or &s;ym|pathetically affected.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. An acute di&s;ea&s;e, attended with the vomiting of &s;ome humour, mo&s;tly bilious or acrid mat|ter, at the &s;ame time a frequent inte&s;tinal evacuation, or at lea&s;t a nau&s;ea and tene&s;mus, or frequent de&s;ire to go to &s;tool, accom|panied with anxiety, abdominal pains or gripings, and very of|ten &s;pa&s;modic contractions of the legs.</P>
<P>CURE. The indications are, to &s;heath, dilute, and expel the acrimonious humours, take off the convul&s;ive affection; after|wards to re&s;tore &s;trength and activity to the &s;tomach and inte&s;|tines; and the&s;e are done, fir&s;t, by drinking freely of weak chick|en water, made by boiling a chicken in three gallons of water, to that the decoction ju&s;t ta&s;tes of the fle&s;h&mdash;large draughts of which &s;hould be taken, and given in gly&s;ters till the whole is con&s;umed&mdash;about three or four hours after which an opiate, (No. 4.) may be given; and this mode, if at fir&s;t made u&s;e of, will gene|rally complete the cure.</P>
<P>Or, very weak beef or mutton broth, dive&s;ted of fat&mdash;or milk and water&mdash;fre&s;h butter&mdash;milk&mdash;decoctions of rice or barley&mdash;or infu&s;ions of oaten bread, toa&s;ted and made brown like coffee&mdash;or wheat-bread, or oat-meal toa&s;ted may do, where chicken-broth cannot be had&mdash;indeed the infu&s;ion of the eaten bread has been preferred by &s;ome, as it has been ob&s;erved to fit ea&s;ie&s;t on the &s;tomach, and never vomited up.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the patient have been purged for ten or twelve hours before a&s;&s;i&s;tance has been given, an opiate &s;hould be admi|ni&s;tered during the urgency of the &s;ymptoms, and the do&s;es large and repeated, approportioned to the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;SYDENHAM gave twenty-five drops in an ounce of cinnamon-water, and that proving inefficacious, in half an hour the do&s;e was increa&s;ed, and repeated at &s;uch intervals as gave room to &s;uppo&s;e the effect of the former do&s;e had cea&s;ed, before the &s;uc|ceeding one was admini&s;tered&mdash;and after the &s;everity of the di&s;|ea&s;e

<P>This di&s;ea&s;e, notwith&s;tanding it is often fatal to adults, but mo&s;t of all to &s;uch as are much advanced in life, &s;till in in|fants it is very mild; for they will be affected with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e for &s;ome months without any inconvenience, if it is left to the direction of nature.</P>
<P>Though the general progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e is here de&s;cribed, practice demands as to make &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>If the dy&s;entery is of the INFLAMMATORY KIND, there will be a high degree of fever&mdash;hard full pul&s;e&mdash;extreme pain of the belly, which, on handling, increa&s;es, and, after vomiting is &s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing&mdash;the head aches&mdash;the countenance is flu&s;hed&mdash;&s;ometimes the belly is di&s;tended&mdash;in quantity the evacuations are &s;mall.</P>

<P>CAUSES. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from acrimonious matter of a putrid nature; becau&s;e it makes its appearance in moi&s;t warm &s;ea&s;ons, adapted to generate putre&s;cency, chiefly attacks tho&s;e of &s;corbutic habits, (61.) and originates from vapours of
<PB N="387" REF="028021_0383_0FD6730CB63E5E28">
putre&s;cent blood; particularly becau&s;e it &s;oftens and corrupts the parts affected, generates air very copiou&s;ly, and renders the faeces highly putrid; and al&s;o becau&s;e, on the di&s;&s;ection of bo|dies dying of this complaint, the inte&s;tines, e&s;pecially the colon and rectum, (43, 45.) are preternaturally thick, di&s;tended with air, inflamed, ulcerated, and in a mortified &s;tate&mdash;the inner or villous coat abraded&mdash;the bile greeni&s;h like a leek, vi&s;cid, and often of a black colour&mdash;and the blood very dark in appear|ance.</P>
<P>CURE. Of whatever nature this di&s;ea&s;e may be, the indi|cations are &s;imilar, and depend upon evacuating the acrimony, or determining it to other places&mdash;weakening its action&mdash;allevi|ating the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms, by rendering the inte&s;tines le&s;s &s;en&s;ible to its irritating effects, in its FIRST STAGES&mdash;in the LAST, recovering the tone, and giving &s;trength to the relaxed and wea|kened ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>To promote the&s;e purpo&s;es, in full habits, where there are apparent &s;ymptoms of inflammation, the patient &s;hould be bled once or twice, according to their urgency, and the &s;trength of the patient.</P>
<P>In the next place, the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines &s;hould be unload|ed by emetics and cathartics&mdash;twelve grains of powdered ipeca|cuanha, and one of tartarized antimony, &s;hould be well mixed to|gether, and divided into three parts, and one given every &s;econd hear&mdash;no liquid &s;hould be taken after the fir&s;t do&s;e; but after the third, weak beef tea, or chicken broth, &s;hould be drank liberally to encourage the vomiting&mdash;after which a &s;light opiate will be requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>Should the emetic produce &s;mart evacuations upwards and downwards, the &s;ucceeding day it is not nece&s;&s;ary to order any thing except a grain of opium, mixed with three or four grains of ipecacuanha into pills, with &s;yrup of white poppy heads, and given at bed-time.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the emetic not have produced any purgative ef|fects, a purging powder, made of thirty grains of rhubarb, and three of calomel, mu&s;t be admini&s;tered the morning following.&mdash;As for my own part, in the beginning of this complaint, I pre|fer the oil of ca&s;tor emul&s;ion, (No. 66) as it relaxes the coats of the &s;tomach, &s;heaths the acrimony, produces evacuations, and mitigates the pains of the bowels.</P>
<P>But as is the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o &s;hould be the election of our purgatives&mdash;if of the <HI>inflammatory kind,</HI> the &s;alines are pre|ferable, (172,)&mdash;if the <HI>putre&s;cent,</HI> the anti&s;eptic, as tamarinds, cream of tartar, &amp;c; (No. 23, 24. 50, 51.) but in every ca&s;e,
<PB N="388" REF="028021_0384_0FD6734981A67858">
after the effects is produced, an opiate &s;hould be admini&s;tered at night.</P>
<P>In the intermediate &s;paces of time, &s;mall do&s;es of nitre, accom|panied with antimonials and &s;aline mixtures, may be exhibited, joined with &s;heathing medicines, &s;uch as gum tragacanth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tarch, if the fever keeps up&mdash;or &s;hould it be of the <HI>low malig|nant,</HI> gentle cordials are proper.</P>
<P>However, &s;hould not the di&s;ea&s;e &s;oon yield to this mode, but the &s;ymptoms &s;till continue, particularly griping and purging, &s;mall do&s;es of ipecacuanha may be given, &s;ufficient only to cre|ate a nau&s;ea, (No. 133.) increa&s;ing or decrea&s;ing the do&s;e agreea|ble to the effects, and joining it with anti&s;eptics, cooling, or cordial medicines, as the particular nature of the ca&s;e may re|quire.</P>
<P>Should the &s;tools continue remarkably vi&s;cid and offen&s;ive, e|very &s;econd or third day a purgative &s;hould be given, and at night an opiate.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t proceed in this manner, till, from the regularity of the pul&s;e, the ce&s;&s;ation of pain, and propen&s;ity to &s;tools, as well as from the want of them, we may conclude the di&s;ea&s;e termi|nated&mdash;but &s;hould not the&s;e appearances occur in the cour&s;e of a few days, we have rea&s;on to apprehend the greate&s;t danger&mdash;we mu&s;t then, if the &s;ymptoms continue as violent as at fir&s;t, have recour&s;e to fomentations, (No. 111.) and gly&s;ters of the &s;heath|ing and anodyne &s;ort, made of milk, broth, mar&s;h-mallow or lin&s;eed decoction, with &s;tarch and tincture of opium.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the ipecacuanha, other medicines are recommended, and, if we believe the recommendation, falling little &s;hort of <HI>infalibility,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> form two to ten grains of created gla&s;s of anti|mony, from ten to fifteen grains of powdered columbo every three or four hours&mdash;the decoction of &s;emirauba bark is con&s;i|dered as a <HI>&s;pecific,</HI> and &s;aid to remove the di&s;ea&s;e without the danger or inconveniencies attendant on a&s;tringents, (No. 134.)</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the complaints a&s;tringents are u&s;eful, parti|cularly tonics; and, indeed, al&s;o when the mo&s;t violent &s;ymp|toms of fever, pain, and tene&s;mus have cea&s;ed, to relieve the re|laxed &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uing the modes here laid down, we &s;hall &s;eldom fail of curing this complaint; but &s;hould it be accompanied with a pu|trid malignant fever, there will be little hope of a recovery&mdash;however, we &s;hould try the effects of ANTISEPTICS, (192 to 194.) particularly wine, infu&s;ions of bark and &s;nake-root, with a few drops of tincture of opium in each do&s;e, and the free u&s;e of &s;u|bacid fruits, (192.) taken by them&s;elves, or &s;queezed plentiful|ly into other liquids&mdash;indeed, fruit, and things of a &s;imilar na|ture

will form, in the&s;e ca&s;es, the proper plan of diet&mdash;but when dy&s;enteries are unattended with any high degree of putrefaction, demotions, and jellies of rice, &s;ago, tapioca, &s;alep, the white de|coction, chalk mixture, weak chicken-broth or beef tea, are mo&s;t proper&mdash;though all &s;olid animal food mu&s;t be avoided.</P>
<P>When flatulencies become di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, which will &s;ometimes be the ca&s;e, chamomile flower tea, infu&s;ion of cinnamon or cloves, or liquids impregnated &s;lightly with other aromatics, may be occa&s;ionally admini&s;tered with great advantage.</P>
<P>However, we have had in&s;tances of &s;ome of the&s;e complaints which were epidemical, and from their nature &s;o extremely de|&s;tructive, as exceeded the powers of medicine, &s;uppo&s;ed to be owing to their deducing their origin from acrimonious humours, highly cau&s;tic&mdash;in which a total lo&s;s of &s;trength, &s;welling of the belly, &s;inking of the pul&s;e, a di&s;charge of blacki&s;h &s;tools, and clammy &s;weats, were certain &s;igns of the irremediable &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the COMMON DIARRHOEA, if it is unattended with any weakne&s;s, lo&s;s of appetite, or febrile affections, and is moderate in quantity, it very often is of &s;ervice to the con&s;titu|tion, and is rather conducive to health than otherwi&s;e; but &s;hould it can on to too great exce&s;s, it will require the &s;ame means for its care, and will be conquered much more ea&s;ily than the dy|&s;entery&mdash;and, indeed, all the other &s;pecies we have &s;pecified re|quire the &s;ame treatment&mdash;at the beginning clearing the fir&s;t pa&s;|&s;ages of any irritating contents, by proper emetics and cathar|tics, next &s;oliciting the flow of fluids to the &s;urface by diapho|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">, and &s;trengthening the &s;tomach and bowels by tonic a&s;trin|gent, bitters &s;trengthening medicines, and <HI>particularly</HI> riding on hor&s;eback, at the clo&s;e of the complaint.</P>

<P>The mind of the patient &s;hould be kept perfectly at ea&s;e&mdash;and the fir&s;t and &s;econd bleeding &s;hould be copious, from large ori|fices, and quickly repeated, if the violence of the ca&s;e requires it&mdash;for one free bleeding in this &s;tage is of infinitely more &s;er|vice than a number of &s;paring ones.</P>
<P>Nitre &s;hould be given freely in any eligible form, as it is much to be depended upon; for it le&s;&s;ens the motion of the blood, and allays its heat, con&s;equently prevents &s;trong va&s;cular action, and the expan&s;ive power of the blood.</P>
<P>Keeping the body open with cooling aperients, (171, 172.) particularly Glauber's &s;alts largely diluted, (No. 135.) is ex|tremely u&s;eful, taken now and then, till the effect is produced twice, or oftener.</P>

<P>This method in common and recent ca&s;es will almo&s;t always &s;ucceed; but when it proceeds from previous injury in the tex|ture of the blood, and weakne&s;s of the lungs, con&s;tituting that kind which is habitual or con&s;umptive, little can be expected from bleeding; for this, by weakening the &s;y&s;tem, and contri|buting more to di&s;&s;olve the texture of the blood, &s;eems rather calculated to increa&s;e the mi&s;chief, ina&s;much as it adds power to its cau&s;es; &s;mall do&s;es of antimonials, (180.) or ipecacuanha, (180.) are mo&s;t likely to produce good effects, by determining the flow of blood to the &s;urface, and demulcents, (188.) by ad|ding to the vi&s;cidity of the fluids.</P>
<P>And &s;hould the pain, difficulty of breathing, and cough, cea&s;e with the efflux of blood, we may give tonic medicines, as de|coction of bark, (193.) to which may be added the bal&s;am of ca|pivi, (165.) or &s;ome of the mild bal&s;amic cla&s;s; for we may rea|&s;onably infer, that there is no more extrava&s;ated fluids in the pul|monary ve&s;icles.</P>
<P>But it &s;ometimes happens unfortunately, notwith&s;tanding all our efforts, that though the efflux of blood may be &s;topped for a few hours, or days, it will return with a quick hard pul&s;e, trou|ble&s;ome cough, oppre&s;&s;ion, and difficulty of breathing, then we may have rea&s;on to be alarmed, and fear a &s;upervening con&s;ump|tion&mdash;in this ca&s;e we have little to depend upon but general re|medies, &s;uch as goats whey, a&s;s' milk mixed with Seltzer water&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the waters of Bri&s;tol &s;hould be had recour&s;e to&mdash;riding, &s;winging, &s;ailing, and a milk diet; for &s;ome have, by the&s;e means being rigidly pur&s;ued, happily recovered.</P>

<P>In this complaint, the matter pa&s;&s;ed through the urethra is either pure blood, or bloody urine, that is, urine having acquired inten&s;e redne&s;s from being mixed with &s;ome particles of blood. The mo&s;t common cau&s;es of which are &s;tones, or gravel lacera|ting the different parts of the urinary pa&s;&s;ages; but it may be occa&s;ioned by venereal exce&s;&s;es, as blood may i&s;&s;ue from the &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els (two membranaceous cellular tubes, lying on each &s;ide, between the bladder, (50.) and rectum, (45.) on the out&s;ide of the va&s;a deferentia, (53.) and al&s;o from the pro&s;tate glands; (54.) hence are they con&s;idered among&s;t the cau&s;es, as are al&s;o di&s;&s;olution of the blood, or violent exertions of the

<P>Whatever may be the cau&s;e, two points are to be con&s;idered, whether there is an <HI>inflammatory,</HI> or, <HI>putrefactive</HI> di&s;po&s;ition in the blood.</P>
<P>If the former is prevalent, and the habit full, we mu&s;t bleed, and that repeatedly, till we have taken off the general plenitude, and allayed the inten&s;ene&s;s of the action of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, the bowels &s;hould be kept open with &s;aline purges and manna, (172.) and emul&s;ions with gum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and cooling decoctions of lin&s;eed tea mixed with nitre, &s;hould be freely admini&s;tered, and the uva ur&s;i (139.) may be admini&s;tered, which in this ca&s;e I have &s;een extremely efficacious, other a&s;tringents are not advi&s;eable.</P>

<P>But without either of the con&s;titutional tendencies above re|cited, &s;hould the cau&s;e be a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of men&s;es, or piles, and the&s;e cannot be re&s;tored or &s;olicited to their natural pa&s;&s;ages&mdash;occa&s;ional bleeding will be a &s;alutary &s;ub&s;titute.</P>
<P>Or &s;hould it deduce its origin only from calculi, during the fits of pain we mu&s;t guard the parts again&s;t the effects of their &s;timulus, by emollient and demulcent remedies, (140&mdash;187.)&mdash;aetherial &s;pirits of nitre, and &s;uch like&mdash;afterwards we mu&s;t endeavour to &s;trike at the cau&s;e, as recommended in pain of the kidneys.

<P>Here we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that in all ca&s;es of great pain, opiates &s;hould not be forgot, e&s;pecially if &s;tone or gravel is the cau&s;e&mdash;and, indeed, in di&s;charges from the ureters, and kidneys, the infu&s;ion of carrot-&s;eed (No. 123) has not been &s;lightly recom|mended.</P>

The <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing,</HI> pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eding febrile di&s;ea&s;es, particularly if they are &s;ubdued by immoderate evacuations&mdash;too long continued u&s;e of acidulated waters, particularly in a cold climate, or diuretic medicines&mdash;al&s;o the bite of a &s;erpent called DIPSAS, from the Greek word <HI>dip&s;a,</HI> &s;itis, thir&s;t, becau&s;e it occa&s;ions &s;o great thir&s;t as often proves mortal.</P>
<P>The <HI>proximate</HI> or <HI>immediate,</HI> an increa&s;e of action of the &s;e|cretory ve&s;&s;els of the kidneys, ari&s;ing from a &s;tate of relaxation, and a thin acrid &s;ero&s;ity of the circulating fluids, and a too pow|erful determination of them to the kidneys.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. A preternatural di&s;charge of urine, immoderate in quantity, and of long continuance, at|tended commonly with lo&s;s of appetite, emaciation, and hectic &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>CURE. The indications are, to le&s;&s;en the action of the &s;e|cretory ve&s;&s;els, by altering their relaxed &s;tate, and correcting the too great &s;ero&s;ity and acrimony of the fluids&mdash;hence we mu&s;t apply to the u&s;e of in&s;pi&s;&s;ants, diaphoretics, &s;timulants, and tonics&mdash;and as &s;oliciting a flow of liquids to the &s;kin will pre|vent too great a determination to the kidneys, in order to keep a free and con&s;tant &s;tate of per&s;piration, the patient &s;hould wear a flannel &s;hirt next the &s;kin, u&s;e moderate exerci&s;e, and dry friction.</P>
<P>Alum whey is &s;trongly recommended, (No. 138.) four oun|ces to be taken at lea&s;t three times a day&mdash;lime-water drank al&s;o, whil&s;t the warmth in quenching continues, taken as freely as the thir&s;t requires, has been &s;aid to exceed the u&s;e of Bri&s;tol water, which by &s;ome has been con&s;idered as a &s;pecific in this di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;half an ounce, or &s;ix drams of oak bark infu&s;ed in two pints of lime-water, and the chalybeate waters, have had their powerful advocates.</P>
<P>White vitriol is a u&s;eful a&s;tringent, (139.) but &s;ome depend on half a grain of blue vitriol given twice a day in any proper liquid.</P>
<P>Preparations of iron, (139.) or elixir of vitriol joined with bark, (193, 194.) are no inferior tonics; and, by &s;trengthening the habit, contribute much in the promotion of per&s;piration.</P>

Rhubarb, (173.) has been recommended as efficacious in lay|ing the foundation for the &s;ucce&s;s of anti&s;pa&s;modics.</P>
<P>As a &s;timulant, tincture of cantharides, (175.) is by &s;ome in this ca&s;e looked upon as a &s;pecific.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the thir&s;t is a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptom, a|queous liquids &s;hould be avoided&mdash;they &s;hould be impregnated with &s;ome in&s;pi&s;&s;ating ingredient, as comfrey-root, or made with lime; and the&s;e &s;hould be u&s;ed as common drink&mdash;boiled meat is le&s;s u&s;eful than roa&s;ted&mdash;broth made of beef may be al|lowed&mdash;&s;hell-fi&s;h&mdash;wild fowl&mdash;jellies in &s;mall quantities, and of|ten repeated&mdash;tapioca, milk, rice gruels, and &s;uch &s;imilar viands, may be permitted.</P>

<P>This di&s;ea&s;e &s;ometimes affects hy&s;teric patients, who pa&s;s large quantities of limpid urine; hence it is called <HI>hy&s;tericus</HI>&mdash;&s;ometimes it &s;upervenes intermittents; hence denominated <HI>inter|mittens</HI>&mdash;&s;ometimes it attacks people worn out by the gout, in whom, during the painful fits, the urine is &s;mall in quantity, and turbid; but in the intervals of the di&s;charge, from per&s;pi|ration being defective, becomes clear, watery, and copious.</P>
<P>To the general plan, which we have before laid down, we mu&s;t therefore &s;ubjoin anti&s;pa&s;modics, under the fir&s;t circum|&s;tance&mdash;under the &s;econd, tonics, particularly bark&mdash;and under the third, invigorating cordials, agreeable to the &s;pecific nature of the ca&s;e. See HYSTERIA, INTERMITTENT FEVER, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>Sometimes people will be affected with a morbid evacuation of &s;weat, where that di&s;charge is remarkable for its quantity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and un&s;ea&s;onablene&s;s&mdash;this is called</P>

<HEAD>&sect; 2. EPHIDROSIS, OR MORBID EVACUATION OF SWEAT</HEAD>
<P>from <HI>ephidroo,</HI> &s;uderam movere, to occa&s;ion &s;weating, which is proportionable to the quantity of per&s;pirable matter contained in the blood, to the velocity with which it is &s;eparated, and to the heat or laxity of the pores of the &s;kin&mdash;when it ari&s;es from an increa&s;ed circulation of the blood, it is active&mdash;when it de|pends upon the laxity of the &s;kin, and &s;uperabundance of &s;erum, it is pa&s;&s;ive.</P>

<P>But when the&s;e profu&s;e &s;weatings are connected with miliary, hectic, or other fevers, we are not to con&s;ider the di&s;charge as a di&s;ea&s;e which requires management particularly adapted to it|&s;elf, we mu&s;t endeavour to de&s;troy or evacuate the &s;eeds of the

febrile affection, as by that means only can we conquer its con|&s;equences; for in tho&s;e ca&s;es the &s;weating is purely &s;ymptom|atic.</P>
<P>But when profu&s;e di&s;charges of the &s;kin come on without any evident cau&s;e or fever, flowing chiefly in the nights, and oc|ca&s;ions falling away of the fle&s;h, lo&s;s of &s;trength and appetite, with lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, it then requires medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>CURE. Here are indicated a diver&s;ion of the flow of fluids, a decrea&s;e of their ferocity, and our endeavours to give general force and tone to the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Hence purgatives, at proper intervals, will an&s;wer the fir&s;t and &s;econd indications&mdash;tonics and &s;trengthening medicines the la&s;t, &s;uch as preparations of iron, bark, bitters; &s;teel waters, mo|derate exerci&s;e, and the u&s;e of the cold bath&mdash;to which we would add, the frequent admini&s;tration of milk.</P>
<P>Properly &s;upporting, and judiciou&s;ly increa&s;ing the alvine di&s;|charges, are in this ca&s;e extremely beneficial; for the&s;e divert the flow of fluids from the &s;kin, as in the former ca&s;e increa&s;ing per&s;piration &s;olicited the humours from their determination to the kidneys.</P>
<P>When this complaint ari&s;es, as it &s;ometimes does, from a &s;corbutic acrimony, and the blood being in a loo&s;e di&s;&s;olved &s;tate, which is very often &s;ucceeded by that &s;pecies of con&s;ump|tion called ATROPHY&mdash;the &s;weat pours forth in the middle of winter under the &s;lighte&s;t covering, and at the &s;ame time affects the patients with re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and anxiety; nor do they cea&s;e till the vitiated humours are in a great mea&s;ure di&s;charged by this cuticular flux.</P>
<P>Here, as well as where the &s;weats are of different colours, the remedies recommended are, the juices of fre&s;h vegetables, &s;ubacid fruits, and the u&s;e of tonics, particularly bark.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="disease">
<HEAD>&sect; 1. TETANUS;</HEAD>
<P>SO called from the Greek word <HI>teino,</HI> firmo&mdash;and its varieties&mdash;EMPROSTHOTONOS&mdash;from <HI>empro&s;thon,</HI> ante, before&mdash;<HI>epi&s;t|hon,</HI> pone, behind&mdash;and TRISMUS, from <HI>trizo,</HI> &s;tridor. The&s;e are marked by different appearances ari&s;ing from &s;imilar cau&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="028021_0411_0FD67396B2F32AC8">
The TETANUS&mdash;is a &s;pa&s;tic rigidity of the whole body&mdash;commonly continued&mdash;and involuntary; if it is bent forwards it is called EMPROSTHOTONOS&mdash;if backwards, OPISTHOTONOS&mdash;when the jaws are fixed clo&s;e, TRISMUS, or locked jaw.</P>
<P>This complaint is mo&s;t commonly met with in hot countries, where it is con&s;idered as endemial, particularly in rainy &s;ea&s;ons &s;ucceeding tho&s;e which are hot, or in &s;uch where there are &s;ud|den changes from extreme heat to extreme cold, as in South Carolina&mdash;among tho&s;e who imprudently expo&s;e them&s;elves to the night air.&mdash;In the more temperate countries it is very rare|ly met with as an original di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. In tetanus the body grows &s;tiff, and ap|pears like a &s;pecies of wood, from the equable contractility of the mu&s;cles before and behind&mdash;a &s;pa&s;modic affection is felt be|low the brea&s;t bone, verging to the &s;pine&mdash;when the &s;pa&s;ms are violent, mo&s;t acute pains come on&mdash;the face is red and di&s;tort|ed&mdash;the cheeks are drawn backwards&mdash;the eyes fixed&mdash;the jaw &s;ometimes locked&mdash;the pul&s;e mo&s;t frequently is &s;lower than what is natural&mdash;and &s;hould blood be taken, its texture appears to be le&s;s firm&mdash;there is much difficulty in re&s;piration&mdash;the body is co&s;tive&mdash;the natural actions only are not &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the &s;en&s;es both external and internal, remain perfect&mdash;the ribs curve inwards&mdash;and if the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould be conquered, the patient continues a long time in a &s;tate of great debility.</P>
<P>In the two &s;ucceeding varieties, the neck at fir&s;t becomes immoveable&mdash;afterwards, by &s;trong &s;pa&s;ms, it is drawn either backwards or forwards&mdash;the motion of the jaw and the act of &s;wallowing are impeded&mdash;the &s;pa&s;m under the brea&s;t-bone brings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> others which are more violent&mdash;the pul&s;e is &s;ometimes &s;low and hard&mdash;at others &s;mall, fluctuating, and irregular&mdash;the tongue grows rigid&mdash;a bloody kind of froth i&s;&s;ues from the mouth&mdash;the mu&s;cles of the &s;pine and inferior extremities are drawn into &s;imilar action&mdash;at length, either by the &s;pa&s;ms be|coming more violent, or from an epileptic attack, the unhappy patient expires.&mdash;In the third variety, the di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;ymp|tom is, a &s;trong contraction of the mu&s;cles which elevate the lower jaw.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are of the mo&s;t dangerous nature, as very few &s;urvive the third day, without they come on gradually; and in that ca&s;e, if the patient can get over nine or ten days, there is a greater chance of a recovery&mdash;hence, from the manner of the attack, it is that we are to e&s;timate the degrees of danger.</P>
<P>CURE. The indications here, are to take off as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible the &s;pa&s;modic affections, and afterwards to give tone
<PB N="416" REF="028021_0412_0FD67364BB2B3B68">
to the &s;y&s;tem&mdash;and the&s;e are done chiefly by the bold admini|&s;tration of opium, and the warm bath; for opium given in this way has been known to cure when every other remedy has been tried in vain.</P>
<P>The quantity of opium to be given at a do&s;e, and its repeti|tions, depend upon the violence of the &s;pa&s;ms&mdash;therefore, from one or two to five grains may be given every hour in any con|venient vehicle, and the do&s;e may, according to the urgency of the &s;ymptoms, be occa&s;ionally increa&s;ed; for in the&s;e ca&s;es it never &s;tupifies&mdash;it may be advantageou&s;ly u&s;ed with other &s;pa&s;|modics, particularly a&s;afoetida or mu&s;k; and the&s;e likewi&s;e mu&s;t be freely exhibited: gly&s;ters al&s;o of opium di&s;&s;olved may be thrown into the inte&s;tines, joined with oil or turpentine, di&s;|&s;olved in the yolk of an egg; and the&s;e mu&s;t be often repeated, particularly if there is any difficulty of &s;wallowing, or the jaws are clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The body mu&s;t, if po&s;&s;ible, be kept open by do&s;es of manna, Polychre&s;t, Glauber's, or Rochelle &s;alt, or that of Ep&s;om, form|ed into emul&s;ions, with oil of almonds and tincture of &s;enna&mdash;or ca&s;tor oil will, perhaps, better an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. (See No. 97, 98, 99, 118.)</P>
<P>With regard to warm bathing, tho&s;e who recommend it or|der the patient to lie along the bath, and, whil&s;t they are in it, frictions u&s;ed&mdash;when taken out, to be wrapped up wet as they are in warm blankets, and put to bed, having, whil&s;t there, the abdomen fomented, and a bladder full of warm water laid upon the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>The copious exhibition of bark and wine, two or three oun|ces of the former, and from two to three pints of the latter, in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, have, from their &s;ucce&s;s, been recommended; along with which a bli&s;ter was applied to the back, and two or three ounces of mercurial ointment rubbed in|to the throat, in the &s;pace of ten days.</P>
<P>Cold bathing has al&s;o been u&s;ed with &s;ome efficacy, and &s;eem|ed to an&s;wer, though the patients were plunged into the water during the violence of the fits of pain and &s;pa&s;m.&mdash;Oil of amber and flowers of zinc have been recommended among&s;t the pow|erful anti&s;pa&s;modics in the&s;e ca&s;es</P>
<P>From the very different methods u&s;ed by practitioners i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e complaints, which &s;eem, according to our conceptions, to produce &s;uch oppo&s;ite actions on the habit, and both proving &s;ucce&s;sful, I &s;hould conclude, that the nature of the habit con&s;ti|tutes the nece&s;&s;ity for this deviation.</P>
<P>In con&s;titutions, therefore, which were athletic and robu&s;t,
<PB N="417" REF="028021_0413_0FD6739A22CECFF8">
with a hard full pul&s;e, I &s;hould not he&s;itate to bleed, and have recour&s;e to the &s;edative mode of opium, joined with anti&s;pa&s;mo|dics, and warm bathing.</P>
<P>In &s;uch as were relaxed, and &s;hewed evident &s;igns of debility, to the &s;timulant and &s;trengthening: of bark and wine, joined with anti&s;pa&s;modics&mdash;bli&s;tering&mdash;and the cold bath&mdash;and in both, to the local application of mercurial inunction.</P>
<P>And when it proceeded from any local affections, out off all communication between the part affected and the common &s;en|&s;orium, by dividing the nerve, or amputating the part; for this has proved &s;ucce&s;sful, by removing the irritable cau&s;e, which &s;ympathetically induces &s;uch dangerous &s;pa&s;modic affections&mdash;and in ca&s;es of locked jaw, a bli&s;ter &s;hould be applied to the throat.</P>
<P>After the di&s;ea&s;e is conquered, in order to prevent a relap&s;e, and recruit the &s;trength of the patient, we &s;hould have recour&s;e to bark and chalybeates, cold, or &s;ea bathing, and &s;uch other modes as we have formerly recommended to people recovering from other &s;evere di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

<P>&s;o called from the Greek word <HI>epilambane&s;thai,</HI> di&s;uper depre|hendi, to be &s;eized from above.

<P>It is a &s;udden deprivation of the internal and external &s;en&s;es, with violent alternate contractions and relaxations of almo&s;t the whole of the mu&s;cles of the human machine, termed convul|&s;ive;&mdash;of which there are &s;aid to be three &s;pecies&mdash;<HI>cerebralis,</HI> from affection of the brain, when it owes its origin to &s;ome im|perceptible cau&s;e, preceded by no unea&s;ine&s;s, except giddine&s;s or lo&s;s of &s;ight&mdash;when it ari&s;es from any manife&s;t cau&s;e, and is preceded by &s;ome &s;ingular &s;en&s;ation, mounting upwards from different parts of the body to the head it is termed <HI>&s;ympathica,</HI> as deriving its origin from &s;ympathetic affections&mdash;when from perceptible irritation the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it is brought on, and vani&s;hes on the ce&s;&s;ation of that morbid effect, <HI>occa&s;ionalis.</HI></P>
<P>It differs from convul&s;ion, from being accompanied by total in&s;en&s;ibility&mdash;in its returning at different periods, though not al|ways regular&mdash;in its being a chronic di&s;ea&s;e, that often, with|out de&s;troying life, continues for a &s;eries of years.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. The attack of an epilep&s;y is &s;omething like that of an apoplexy, the patient falls down &s;uddenly, de|prived of all &s;en&s;e&punc; but then they do not, as in an apoplexy, lie quiet, as if in a profound &s;leep&mdash;in this it is quite the rever&s;e, for the whole mu&s;cular &s;y&s;tem is agitated by &s;uch violent con|vul&s;ive motions, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for the attendants to prevent the unfortunate afflicted from hurting them&s;elves&mdash;and &s;hould, during the violence of the paroxy&s;m, the tongue be caught betwixt the teeth, it will be much wounded, bit through, or, perhaps, a portion bit off.</P>

<P>Some people have been &s;o expert, as to counterfeit the&s;e fits &s;o well, that inattentive ob&s;ervers, though medical practitioners, have been deceived&mdash;but we mu&s;t remark, <HI>that a total depriva|tion of &s;en&s;e and feeling</HI> di&s;tingui&s;h the true epilep&s;y&mdash;if, then, by the application of &s;trong volatile &s;ub&s;tances to the no&s;e, or &s;uddenly pricking &s;ome &s;en&s;ible part, without mentioning the in|tent, they &s;hew evident &s;igns of feeling, the deception may be made obvious.</P>
<P>Sometimes, before the fit comes on, it will be preceded by wearine&s;s, &s;tupor, head-ach, or giddine&s;s affecting the &s;ight&mdash;ringing in the ears&mdash;frightful dreams, palpitation of the heart, difficulty of breathing&mdash;a fullne&s;s of, and rumbling noi&s;e in, the belly&mdash;the patients al&s;o will make larger quantities of limpid urine than u&s;ual&mdash;&s;tammer in their &s;peech, their countenance will be pale, their extremities cold, and complain of a &s;en&s;ation of cold air a&s;cending to the head.</P>
<P>CAUSES.

<P>CURE. As &s;everal of the preci&s;e cau&s;es cannot before death be di&s;covered; or were they, <HI>they</HI> would be irremediable&mdash;we mu&s;t content our&s;elves with general modes of cure, and depend upon tho&s;e applications which have, in a variety of ca&s;es from

experience, proved &s;ucce&s;sful&mdash;but where the cau&s;es are per|ceptible, and within the reach of our art, they mu&s;t be particu|larly adverted to, and removed.</P>
<P>In this complaint, from undi&s;coverable cau&s;es, a variety of me|dicines, chiefly empirical, have been recommended&mdash;<HI>animal oil, oil of amber,</HI> (150.)&mdash;<HI>flowers of lady's &s;mock,</HI> twenty grains, increa&s;|ed to thirty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in powder twice a day&mdash;<HI>leaves of the orange tree,</HI> a handful boiled in a pint of water for two do&s;es, or in pow|der, half a dram twice a day&mdash;<HI>blue vitriol.</HI> (139.) twice a day&mdash;<HI>ammoniacal copper,</HI> a quarter of a grain&mdash;<HI>bark</HI> and <HI>valerian,</HI> join|ed with <HI>cinnabar,</HI> (No. 140.)&mdash;flowers of zinc, (139.) have been highly &s;poken of, and &s;aid to have performed permanent cures.</P>
<P>According to different con&s;titutional circum&s;tances various methods have been recommended.</P>
<P>1&s;t, Where the fluids have been acrimonious&mdash;or, 2d, in a &s;tate of fullne&s;s&mdash;3d, &s;ubject to affections of the &s;tomach, from indige&s;tion or foulne&s;s&mdash;or, 4th, irritation of the inte&s;tines, from worms or other acrid materials.</P>
<P>In the FIRST ca&s;e, cour&s;es of <HI>mineral waters,</HI> which be&s;t agree with the con&s;titution&mdash;<HI>goat's whey&mdash;&s;ea-water&mdash;with cold bathing.</HI></P>
<P>In the SECOND. <HI>i&s;&s;ues</HI> between the &s;houlders, or on the in&s;ide of the thighs&mdash;<HI>&s;etons</HI> in the neck&mdash;<HI>occa&s;ional bleeding</HI>&mdash;and the body &s;hould always be kept open.</P>
<P>In the THIRD, <HI>emetics</HI> given now and then; for they are of &s;ervice, not only by unloading the &s;tomach, but giving a gene|ral &s;hock to the habit; and &s;eem calculated to remove irritation from acrid materials on the origin of the nerves and &s;pinal mar|row, or from the dura mater, (26.) which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the immediate &s;eat of this complaint.</P>
<P>In the FOURTH, purgatives, joined with calomel, &s;hould be admini&s;tered occa&s;ionally, intermediately giving anthelmintics. (196.)</P>
<P>The mind, at the &s;ame time, mu&s;t be kept free from any un|ea&s;y &s;en&s;ation or unruly pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;the diet &s;hould be light, and ea&s;ily dige&s;tible&mdash;gentle exerci&s;e&mdash;free, clear air, and whatever will conduce to pre&s;erve an equable circulation of the blood, and keep up per&s;piration, ought not by any means to be avoid|ed; for where there is a predi&s;po&s;ition to convul&s;ive attacks, any irregularity is greatly conducive to occa&s;ion a renewal.</P>
<P>If the fits &s;hould be of long duration, mu&s;tard poultices and bli&s;ters are advi&s;ed&mdash;thru&s;ting a wedge between the teeth to keep the mouth open&mdash;this la&s;t is &s;aid to prevent even the fit, if applied on any warning being given before the fit comes on.</P>
<P>When unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations are felt in the toes, feet, or legs, creep|ing
<PB N="421" REF="028021_0417_0FD6739CB5DE7B48">
upwards, ligatures below the knee in the&s;e ca&s;es have been knowe to prevent the fit&mdash;or, in whatever part the&s;e affections may be perceived, applying ligatures above the part &s;o affect|ed.</P>
<P>Some, however, advi&s;e, during the fit, not any thing to be at|tempted, except preventing the patients from hurting them&s;elves, by getting the tongue between the teeth; and they are of opinion, little can be done to &s;horten the paroxy&s;m.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the mo&s;t effectual remedies, I have generally thought mu&s;k, and have u&s;ed it with &s;ucce&s;s, joined with diaphoretics and tonics&mdash;and, in order to prevent the acce&s;&s;ion or return, oc|ca&s;ional emetics and aperients.</P>
<P>Inveterate and habitual epilep&s;ies are irremediable, as is that al&s;o which is hereditary, if it continues longer than the age of twenty-five.</P>
<P>That &s;pecies callee the HYSTERIC, or UTERINE EPILEPSY, is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;ex of the patient, from its being inter|mixed with, or preceded by, hy&s;teric affection&mdash;by its following the time of the men&s;es, at its periods&mdash;or being brought on by fear, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;imilar cau&s;e&mdash;and by &s;en&s;ation during the fit, being extremely ob&s;cure, though not altogether &s;uppre&s;&s;|ed.</P>
<P>SYDENHAM &s;ays, in this complaint the patients exert unu&s;ual &s;trength, bawl out incoherently and inarticulately, and &s;mite their brea&s;t; and that women mo&s;t &s;ubject to this di&s;ea&s;e, are tho&s;e who have an uncommonly &s;anguineous habit, and are high &s;pi|rited.</P>
<P>Ob&s;tructed men&s;es are generally accounted a cau&s;e of this di&s;|ea&s;e, which makes its appearance agreeable with the periods of this di&s;charge.</P>
<P><HI>Should it happen during the flux,</HI> be&s;ides tho&s;e things indicat|ed from their di&s;charge and painful excretion, volatile and an|tihy&s;teric remedies are required, &s;uch as oil of amber, &s;pirits of vitriolic aether, ca&s;tor or animal oil liquor of hart&s;horn, camphor, mu&s;k, &amp;c. (150.)</P>
<P><HI>If from the men&s;es being ob&s;tructed,</HI> &s;uch things &s;hould be ad|mini&s;tered as are calculated to promote the di&s;charge, as mad|der-root, (139.) tincture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Spani&s;h flies, (175.) ammoniacal iron, (139.) &s;abine, (149.) bathing the feet in warm water.</P>
<P>Extract of hemlock, (152.) taken for two months, cured a girl &s;eized with an epilep&s;y, who for five years had experienced many fits.</P>
<P>Dividing the cartilaginous, or gri&s;tly &s;ub&s;tance of the ear with a knife, not extremely &s;harp, and thick at the back, &s;o that the divi&s;ion may be large, has been &s;ucce&s;sful, procuring and pro|moting,

<HEAD>CHAP. II. PASSIVE NERVOUS AFFECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE nervous di&s;ea&s;es of which we have before treated are ob|viou&s;ly of the active &s;ort; but there are others which are a&s;&s;ociated with inactivity, with re&s;pect to mu&s;cular motion, and con&s;titute a cla&s;s of di&s;ea&s;es oppo&s;ite to the former. The&s;e are ranked by authors under the terms DEBILITIES and PRIVA|TIONS; becau&s;e of the lo&s;s of, or weakened action of particu|lar powers in the con&s;titution, which are the di&s;tingui&s;hing cha|racteri&s;tics of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Dr. CULLEN arranges the&s;e under nervous di&s;ea&s;es; and are known by that propen&s;ity to &s;leep, mu&s;cular relaxation, and in|&s;en&s;ibility, which are their con&s;tant concomitants.</P>
<P>But, in order to give a proper idea of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, we &s;hould con&s;ider the cau&s;e of the three predominant &s;ymptoms. If we revert back to what has been &s;aid, page 27, on nervous in|citability, and mu&s;cular irritability, and to the introductory part of nervous affections, we &s;hall not be at a lo&s;s to account for two of the &s;ymptoms.&mdash;As for the unnatural propen&s;ity to &s;leep, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from the nerves not being &s;uffici|ently &s;upplied with their proper fluid, either from a defect of the general ma&s;s of this enlivening liquid, or from &s;ome com|pre&s;&s;ion on the nerves, by which its free di&s;tribution is imped|ed.</P>
<P>Hence extreme cold, exce&s;&s;ive di&s;charges of blood&mdash;conge&s;tion, and over di&s;ten&s;ions of the ve&s;&s;els of the head, of &s;anguinary or &s;erous fluid in the ventricles, (27.) and cellular inter&s;tices of the brain&mdash;extrava&s;ated blood within the cranium&mdash;depre&s;&s;ion, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> fracture of the &s;kull, forcing it upon the brain, &s;o as to compre&s;s the medullary part, and prohibit the circulation of the nervous fluid from thence to the &s;everal organs of &s;en&s;ation, and in&s;tru|ments of voluntary motion, may give ri&s;e to this &s;ymptom of &s;omnolency, or unnatural propen&s;ity to &s;leep.</P>

<P>&s;o termed from the Greek <HI>apople&s;&s;o,</HI> de&s;uper percutio, to be &s;truck down, is a deprivation of all the internal and external &s;en&s;es and animal motion, except of the heart and che&s;t, attended with oppre&s;&s;ed re&s;piration, and &s;leep more or le&s;s profound.

<P>CURE. Nature has &s;ometimes, by her own efforts, relieved and remedied this complaint, <HI>but &s;eldom,</HI> by producing &s;ome co|pious evacuation, as bleeding from the no&s;e, loo&s;ene&s;s, or a large flow of &s;aliva, though the cure is generally dependent upon art.</P>

<P>DESCRIPTION.

<P>CURE. Whatever may be the cau&s;e, our indications are, to endeavour to remove that which proximately, as well as more remotely, contributes to impede the due influence of the ner|vous power, by intercepting the influx of the fluid in the nerves, by which it is &s;aid that influence is promoted; and attempt &s;o to &s;trengthen the affected part, and the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem, by which their &s;trength and activity may be recovered.</P>
<P>Now, as the hemiplegia and paraplegia &s;eem to be &s;o nearly allied to apoplexy, as they are occa&s;ioned by the &s;ame cau&s;es, only differently &s;ituated, that they require &s;imilar remedies, we &s;hall therefore only mention them in general, and refer for fur|ther particulars to what we have &s;aid when &s;peaking on that &s;ubject&mdash;at lea&s;t for the recent attacks of the pal&s;y&mdash;and the&s;e mu&s;t be regulated by the nature of the con&s;titution.</P>

<P>But the mo&s;t capital and efficacious are the Bath waters&mdash;or, where they cannot be afforded, warm baths, &s;prinkling, whil&s;t in the bath, upon the part affected, a &s;olution of vitriolated iron. (139.)</P>
<P>Stimulating the parts with nettles has produced good effects, as well as electricity, particularly in local pal&s;ies.</P>
<P>The diet of the patients thus affected &s;hould be of the warm aromatic kind, taking with their viands freely of mu&s;tard, which al&s;o may be applied externally, and hor&s;e-radi&s;h&mdash;drink|ing a gla&s;s of mu&s;tard wine twice a day&mdash;or a table-&s;poonful of whole mu&s;tard-&s;eed may be admini&s;tered in a gla&s;s of wine&mdash;they &s;hould u&s;e bri&s;k exerci&s;e&mdash;&s;leep moderately&mdash;and live in a warm dry air&mdash;cold mu&s;t be avoided&mdash;and connubial indul|gencies very rarely gratified.</P>

<P>Though the&s;e complaints frequently terminate fatally in a &s;hort time, yet they &s;ometimes continue for a &s;eries of years. When the &s;en&s;e of feeling remains, there is much more proba|bility of a certain recovery than in ca&s;es where both motion and &s;en&s;ation are lo&s;t. A pal&s;y of the lower extremities and abdo|men is for the mo&s;t part fatal, and often attended with a morti|fication of the di&s;ea&s;ed parts.</P>
<P>Should the part, however, be painful, have perception, retain a degree of warmth, and does not wa&s;te away or a tremor comes on, there may be &s;ome expectations of a recovery; but more particularly if a &s;en&s;ation of creeping or pricking be perceived&mdash;&s;ometimes febrile affections coming on have been the means of curing the complaint&mdash;and a loo&s;ene&s;s has been of evident advantage tending to the &s;ame end.</P>

<P>THIS is divided into two &s;pecies&mdash;MANIA, <HI>furious madne&s;s</HI> and MELANCHOLIA, <HI>glooomy madne&s;s.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding which divi&s;ion, authors have con&s;idered them only as different degrees of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e; which is defined an alienation, of the mind, or deviation from the rules of &s;ound rea&s;on&mdash;or a con&s;tant delirium without fever.</P>
<P>This doctrine has been long given us by ARETAEUS <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> TRALLIAN.

And HOFFMAN, imbibing the opinion, advances, that from attentive practice and ob&s;ervation we learn, that both di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;e from the &s;ame origin and con|taining cau&s;e, and vary only in degree and time of inva&s;ion, that melancholy may be ju&s;tly received as the primary di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> but mania as its exacerbation and accidental effect&mdash;which con|nection daily and every clo&s;e ob&s;ervation confirms; for melan|cholic people, particularly if the di&s;ea&s;e has been of long &s;tand|ing very readily fall into mania; which ea&s;ing, melancholy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> turns again; although afterwards, at certain periods, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> again be revi&s;ited by mania.</P>

<P>The <HI>proximate</HI> or <HI>immediate</HI> of <HI>melancholic affections</HI> may be placed to the too great applau&s;e of thick blood, to the weaken|ed and flaccid brain, and its &s;tagnation and difficult progre&s;s&mdash;<HI>but the origin of mania,</HI> and <HI>foundation</HI> to the more violent and impetuous motion of the thick and melancholic blood through the ve&s;&s;els and fibrellae of the brain, or parts of the brain; whence ari&s;es, on the one hand, too weak influence, on the o|ther, too &s;trong, of the nervous energy.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. MELANCHOLY, or GLOO|MY MADNESS, is &s;aid to be a partial in&s;anity without indige&s;ti|on; or a difficulty of dige&s;tion being a concominant &s;ymptom; for we &s;ay people are in&s;ane, when the relations of things alto|gether fal&s;e are conceived in the mind, &s;o that either the pa&s;&s;ions or actions of mankind may be exerted irrationally, or not with|in the limits of rea&s;on&mdash;and it is called partial, becau&s;e melan|cholic people will do many things, and think on many points, not with proper or well-regulated judgment; yet in &s;ome they act and think with &s;ome degree of &s;ound rea&s;on.</P>
<P>MANIA, or FURIOUS MADNESS, is univer&s;al in&s;anity, where the whole ideas are &s;o generally deranged, that no act, or thought, is conducted within the bounds of cool and deliberate rea&s;on.</P>
<P>CURE. All &s;pecies and degrees of madne&s;s which are he|reditary, or which grow up with people from their early youth, are incurable; and &s;o, <HI>for the mo&s;t part,</HI> are all mania|cal ca&s;es that are above a year's &s;tanding, originate they from whatever &s;ource they may.</P>
<P>Very often the remains, or dregs of &s;ome particular di&s;ea&s;e, as intermittents, &s;mall-pox, nervous fever, give ri&s;e to different degrees of fooli&s;hne&s;s, or madne&s;s, termed <HI>amentia</HI>&mdash;the cure in this ca&s;e mu&s;t be attempted by nouri&s;hing diet, clear air, mode|rate exerci&s;e, and the u&s;e of wine; not by evacuations, which in almo&s;t all other ca&s;es of in&s;anity are generally thought nece&s;|&s;ary, unle&s;s the con&s;titution of the patient be &s;uch as ab&s;olutely to forbid them.</P>
<P>And here we mu&s;t enquire what kinds the patient can be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> be&s;t; and the&s;e &s;hould be proportioned to his &s;trength; el&s;e from being violent, though they may, perhaps, cure furious madne&s;s, they will be apt to bring on incurable dejection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mind, and melancholy.</P>
<P>If patients, therefore, are of a &s;trong habit of body, full, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ymptoms of mania from melancholy make their appearance or, in the earlier &s;tages of melancholy, the ve&s;&s;els &s;hew &s;igns

plenitude, bleeding may be had recour&s;e to, either in the arm, jugular vein, and &s;ometimes by cupping, if any affection of the head requires it; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;hould the patient's weakne&s;s for|bid the taking away much blood, leeches may be applied to the temples.</P>
<P>In recent ca&s;es though this is generally attended with mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; but if of &s;ome continuance, &s;imilar advantages have not been derived from it.</P>
<P>In melancholy, however, bleeding mu&s;t be &s;paringly u&s;ed&mdash;in mania more freely&mdash;and &s;ome con&s;ider opening a vein in the arm &s;ufficient&mdash;bleeding the patient in an erect po&s;ture till near fainting&mdash;which proves &s;ome diminution of the fullne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els of the brain taking place.</P>
<P>Vomiting, in weakly people, with ipecacuanha, (168.)&mdash;in the more robu&s;t, with antimonial wine, or tartarized antimony has been thought preferable, (168.)&mdash;in mania it may be a doubtful remedy, by determining too freely to the head, in melancholy it may be more freely u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Purging is extremely u&s;eful&mdash;the mo&s;t efficacious cathartics have by &s;ome been thought infu&s;ion of &s;enna, (No. 106.) quick|ened with one or two drams of the tincture of jalap, in&s;tead of tincture of aloes, and &s;enna&mdash;but the frequent u&s;e of cooling purges have, from experience been recommended. (No. 147, 148.)</P>
<P>But &s;hould there be an ob&s;truction of the men&s;es in women, or the piles in men, a reproduction of the&s;e evacuations are thought nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;the aloetic purges, (173.) (No. 106. 108.) then will be the mo&s;t proper&mdash;and the&s;e evacuations by vomit and &s;tool require to be alternately repeated.</P>
<P>Diuretics have been con&s;idered by &s;ome of the greate&s;t mo|ment, e&s;pecially if any degree of fever &s;hould accompany in&s;a|nity&mdash;but this will happen more in maniacal ca&s;es; for melan|cholic &s;ubjects, for the mo&s;t part, make too much water&mdash;the mo&s;t proper diuretics are, the vegetable alkali prepared, (191.) and the diuretic &s;alt, (176.) and the&s;e may be given in large do&s;es alternately, two or three times a day.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, di&s;charges by the pores of the &s;kin are to be promoted.</P>
<P>HOFFMAN particularly recommends the warm bath, who has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> numerous in&s;tances of melancholic and maniacal ca&s;es cured by this means. Dr. CULLEN is of a contrary opinion, and has found it rather hurtful to maniacs&mdash;though to rigid melancho|lic habits it may be u&s;eful, or exhibited in form of a partial half bath, pouring at the &s;ame time cold water upon the head and &s;uperior parts of the body.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="028021_0432_0FD6737B761EDFA8">
From camphor having been &s;aid to prove &s;ucce&s;sful in form|ing radical cures, Dr LOCKER gave it in large do&s;es, but with|out &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;though he found camphor di&s;&s;olved in vinegar had good effects&mdash;he thought then the efficacy might depend upon the vinegar&mdash;he gave one ounce and a half of di&s;tilled vinegar every day, after having fir&s;t prepared the patient by bleeding and purging, which he &s;ometimes occa&s;ionally repeated&mdash;eight by this method, and none of them took more than from &s;ix weeks to three months, had the cure completed. He recites the fol|lowing effects, &s;oon after they began the u&s;e of vinegar&mdash;<HI>their eyes lo&s;t their wild &s;taring look, and pre&s;ently after became calm and quiet, it acted chiefly by &s;weating; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore they &s;weat, the &s;ooner they were cured&mdash;the men&s;trual di&s;charge</HI> in &s;uch as were ob&s;tructed, or had too little of this &s;alutary evacuation, <HI>was promoted or increa&s;ed.</HI> From this account, and from the &s;implicity of the medicine, it ought certainly to undergo farther trial.</P>
<P>Bli&s;tering the head has been thought u&s;eful&mdash;and, perhaps, it may, &s;ays Dr. MEAD, in ca&s;es of long &s;tanding; but, in pre|ference, he recommends &s;having the head after the manner of the ancients, and rubbing it often with warm vinegar; and al|&s;o pa&s;&s;ing a &s;eton in the nape of the neck. Dr. CULLEN is of a contrary opinion, for he &s;ays, <Q>in recent ca&s;es, bli&s;tering th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> head has been found u&s;eful in inducing s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">leep; and when it has this effect, the repetition is proper&mdash;but in maniacal ca|&s;es that have la&s;ted for &s;ome time, bli&s;tering has not appeared to be of any &s;ervice</Q>&mdash;and in &s;uch ca&s;es he has not found per|petual bli&s;ters, or any other form of i&s;&s;ue, prove &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>However, &s;etons and i&s;&s;ues I con&s;ider in all ca&s;es of mania extremely &s;erviceable, by preventing a fullne&s;s coming on the habit, from the con&s;tant drain, and this in an ea&s;y and gradual manner.</P>
<P>A frequent u&s;e of the cold bath in ca&s;es of mania is very &s;er|viceable; for CELSUS &s;ays, nothing is &s;o beneficial to the head as cold water. In order, though, to render this remedy the mo&s;t effectual, the maniac &s;hould be plunged into the cold bath by &s;urpri&s;e, and detained in it for &s;ome length of time, frequent|ly pouring cold water upon the head; &s;o, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fear, a cooling effect may be brought on&mdash;this has often been u&s;eful; as has al&s;o the application of ice, &s;now, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the clay-cup to the naked head.</P>
<P>To procure re&s;t, Dr. MONRO u&s;ed to give two drams of bo|rax, camphor, mu&s;k, and other medicines of that cla&s;s, have been preferred to opium, in order to procure &s;leep; for in maniacal ca&s;es opium is u&s;ually forbidden&mdash;but there are in&s;tances, where,
<PB N="437" REF="028021_0433_0FD673AD425E8D58">
in large do&s;es, it has proved a cure&mdash;and, perhaps, if it were tried oftener, more powerful effects may be derived from it&mdash;and after large evacuations and proper bleeding, and where there was no appearance of inflammatory affections of the brain attend|ing mania, and the patients were re&s;tle&s;s, I &s;hould not he&s;itate in having recour&s;e to it, for two or three times; which, &s;hould it be found to exa&s;perate the di&s;ea&s;e, might be ea&s;ily left off&mdash;if otherwi&s;e, the effect would authorize the pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Con&s;tant and hard labour has been recommended; becau&s;e it is &s;aid, forced attention is a very certain means of diverting the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from pur&s;uing any train of thought; and from hence its utility&mdash;al&s;o a journey carried on for any length of time; during <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, complete cures of mania have been known to be effected&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> diverting the attention from di&s;agreeable and painful af|fections.</P>

<P>That the HOOPING-COUGH is a reiterated and violent concu&s;|&s;ion of the pulmonary organs, induced by the convul&s;ive action of the mu&s;cles of ribs, diaphragm, and belly, brought on by the &s;timulus of peculiar infection acting upon the lungs or windpipe, attended with a &s;en&s;e of &s;trangulation, repeated &s;ono|rous in&s;piration, and often with vomiting and expectoration.</P>
<P>CURE. The indications of which are, to correct or evacuate the peculiar infectious matter&mdash;to alleviate and le&s;&s;en the vio|lence and duration of the cough&mdash;and prevent tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs which are likely to ari&s;e in the habit, or parts of it, from its exce&s;s.</P>
<P>But as we know of no means either to correct or clear the con&s;titution of the morbid matter creating the di&s;ea&s;e, on the&s;e we can make no attempt&mdash;we mu&s;t therefore imitate nature in her efforts, by &s;uch means as experience, founded on the know|ledge of the laws of the animal oeconomy, will point out to us, in accompli&s;hing the two &s;ucceeding indications.</P>
<P>In full habits, therefore, if the face &s;wells much in cough|ing, looks red, and al&s;o the eyes, and other appearances of local plenitude &s;hew them&s;elves, bleeding is e&s;&s;entially u&s;eful; and this mu&s;t be repeated &s;o long as &s;uch appearances render it ne|ce&s;&s;ary&mdash;but this mu&s;t not be pu&s;hed too far; for then we &s;hould increa&s;e the convul&s;ive affection&mdash;hence, in the &s;lighter kinds of the di&s;ea&s;e it may be omitted&mdash;the body &s;hould be kept mo|derately open, not le&s;s than two or three &s;tools procured every day&mdash;violent purging, for the rea&s;on above recited, might be hurtful.</P>
<P>Gentle vomiting every day is beneficial in the forenoon, by &s;mall do&s;es of antimonials, one or two &s;poonfuls of the emetic mixture, (No. 11.) for a do&s;e, or as much as will produce the effect&mdash;and &s;hould any feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms attend, a quarter or half a grain of tartarized antimony may be given at night with the powder, (No. 2.) le&s;&s;ening or increa&s;ing the do&s;e according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o the con&s;titution; for this mode not only does good by the &s;hock it gives to the habit, a&s;&s;i&s;ting expectoration, and clearing the &s;tomach, but by determining the fluids to the &s;urface, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, and keeping the body open; which la&s;t if

<P>But, notwith&s;tanding, &s;hould &s;ymptoms appear indicative of an inflammatory tendency on the lungs, which will be &s;hewn by difficulty of breathing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ever, and quick pul&s;e, where no cough|ing for &s;ome time has preceded, bli&s;ters then &s;hould be applied, particularly on the che&s;t.</P>
<P>Rubbing the pit of the &s;tomach, and down the &s;pine, with equal parts of rectified oil of amber and &s;pirits of wine, where there has been no inflammatory &s;ymptoms, or febrile tendency; or after the&s;e had gone off, has been con&s;idered of great u&s;e; but bleeding and purgatives, when nece&s;&s;ary, have preceded their u&s;e.</P>
<P>Small do&s;es of hemlock, (152.) have been given with appa|rent &s;ucce&s;s; and is by much the be&s;t among&s;t that cla&s;s &s;tiled &s;pecifics.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e, where mucus appears vi&s;cid and difficult to expectorate, the ammoniacal mixture, (No. 141. 143.) is not an unprofitable medicine.</P>
<P>The &s;timulating tonic mixture, (No. 144.) has been &s;poken of with exaggerated prai&s;e, but I think too indi&s;criminately&mdash;early in the di&s;ea&s;e I would never recommend it, particular|ly in full habits with an inflammatory tendency&mdash;though in the latter &s;tages, where evacuants have preceded, I have given it with apparent advantage&mdash;and, perhaps, in weak, delicate con|&s;titutions, it may be exhibited at an earlier period, in &s;mall do&s;es two or three times a day, till a &s;light &s;trangury is excited&mdash;the do&s;e may either be dimini&s;hed, or given at longer inter|vals.</P>
<P>However, in the general mode of management, I &s;hould, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> beginning, recommend vomiting and aperients, with bleed|ing, bli&s;tering, and u&s;e of antimonials, if nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;&s;mall do|&s;es of cicuta&mdash;and where no febrile &s;ymptoms declared them|&s;elves, external anti&s;pa&s;modics.</P>
<P>When the &s;ymptoms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad con&s;iderably abated, tonics, particu|larly bark, &s;hould &s;upply their place.</P>
<P>And, in the fir&s;t period, the diet &s;hould be ab&s;temious and &s;paring, as in inflammatory fever, if the &s;ymptoms ran high.&mdash;In the &s;econd, the mode of living &s;hould be more generous&mdash;and &s;hould the lungs be weakened by the violence of the di&s;|ea&s;e, a cour&s;e of a&s;s' milk, riding exerci&s;e, pure, clear air, and the u&s;e of bark, would be proper.&mdash;Indeed, in &s;ome ca&s;es,

change of air is highly nece&s;&s;ary, and very often alone produces the mo&s;t &s;alutary con&s;equences.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t ob&s;erve here, that often, when the coughing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it is over, the patients are almo&s;t always perfectly relieved; but &s;hould they not, and the difficulty of breathing &s;hould continue, and there be any con&s;iderable febrile affections, there is danger, which mu&s;t ever be &s;u&s;pected; for few die but under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances&mdash;now and then bringing on immediate &s;uffocation, and &s;ometimes con&s;umption&mdash;and often attended with extreme|ly trouble&s;ome and painful affections; but it will &s;ometimes occur in &s;o mild a &s;tate, that all fear is unnece&s;&s;ary&mdash;and this will manife&s;t it&s;elf by the gentlene&s;s of the &s;ymptoms; for though the complaint &s;hould be completely exi&s;ting, accom|panied with its certain &s;ymptoms of convul&s;ive cough and hooping, if the&s;e &s;hould be moderate, and their returns ob&s;erve di&s;tant periods&mdash;if the ejection of mucus from the lungs &s;hould be in no great degree&mdash;the difficulty of breathing and febrile affections do not manife&s;t them&s;elves&mdash;and between the fits the patient pre&s;erves his common habits of health, and the &s;ymp|toms gradually decrea&s;e, nature will be her own phy&s;ician&mdash;in the&s;e ca&s;es little is nece&s;&s;ary to be done.</P>

<P>from the Greek word <HI>nothos,</HI> &s;purius.</P>

<P>I confe&s;s my&s;elf of the latter opinion; for, though expectora|tion has been carried on freely in this complaint, the patients notwith&s;tanding have died, which is not the ca&s;e in humoral a&s;th|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, or the inflammatory peripneumony, where the air ve&s;&s;els, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;mall branches of the pulmonary artery, have been affect|ed; for, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the lungs have an opportu|nity of freeing them&s;elves from the oppre&s;&s;ive load, by the free <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">munication tho&s;e parts have with the windpipe&mdash;whil&s;t, on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hand, in order to form a cure, the offending matter mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ufficiently to be re-ab&s;orbed by the lymphatics, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> back into the cour&s;e of circulation.

<P>CURE.

<P>In phlegmatic and relaxed habits, i&s;&s;ues on the in&s;ide of the thigh above the knee may act as a preventive, by hindering a &s;erous accumulation taking place in the cellular &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs, by affording a continual drain to the con&s;titution; but in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it of the di&s;ea&s;e, though advi&s;ed by &s;ome, can afford no re|lief,

<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> THE SECOND, pains attack the legs, which al&s;o &s;well, as do the knees, which impede the motion of the&s;e parts&mdash;be&s;ides, pains al&s;o affect the belly, brea&s;t, vertebrae, and all the mu&s;cles of the machine&mdash;the face begins to look gha&s;tly&mdash;and &s;o great is the languor, when the patients have re&s;trained a long time from motion, that, on being &s;lightly moved, they are apt to faint; and &s;ometimes, if expo&s;ed to the open air, they die; now they have often febrile affections of the erratic, continued, or intermittent kind&mdash;palpitations of the heart, and difficulty of &s;wallowing&mdash;their under&s;tanding and appetite, notwith&s;tanding their great debility, keep up in a tolerable degree&mdash;and they have no pain, except on motion.</P>
<P>THE THIRD STAGE, the tendons and joints grow &s;tiff, they have frequent fainting fits, great dejection of &s;pirits&mdash;and are ex|tremely fearful, from no apparent cau&s;e&mdash;the cicatrices of old ulcers, if there &s;hould be any, again break open&mdash;and on the legs, &s;oft, livid, and painful &s;welling takes place, and &s;pongy ulcers, which bleed&mdash;ob&s;tructions, &s;cirrho&s;ities, ulcers, and mortification effect the vi&s;cera&mdash;the urine is &s;mall in quantity, foetid, high-coloured&mdash;difficulty of breathing, &s;uddenly de&s;tructive, &s;ome|times clo&s;es the &s;cene, or they expire in &s;ome fainting fit.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing</HI> are, living in a moi&s;t, cold atmo&s;phere, particularly if in mar&s;hy &s;ituations&mdash;&s;uppre&s;&s;ed or immoderate evacuations&mdash;mental affections of the gloomy kind, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and fear, preceding di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;an indolent li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, with luxu|rious

indulgences of the appetite&mdash;gro&s;s vi&s;cid food without any, or with too great a &s;carcity of, fre&s;h vegetables&mdash;living upon the coar&s;e &s;alted, &s;moaked, or dried fle&s;h of quadrupeds or fi&s;h&mdash;few of the&s;e cau&s;es &s;ingly are &s;ufficient to bring on this di&s;ea&s;e; there mu&s;t be a combination&mdash;&s;ailors, from other &s;ources be&s;ides the&s;e, are &s;ubject to the &s;curvy, becau&s;e they feed on mu&s;ty bread, wa|ter, fi&s;h, and fle&s;h, which are corrupted.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e cau&s;es, either by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the matter of per&s;pi|ration, which ought to pa&s;s out of the habit, or from their own corrupt nature, induce an alcale&s;cent acrimony in the blood, which particular acrimony is the <HI>immediate cau&s;e</HI> of the &s;cur|vy.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that it not only affects people who live in cold, damp &s;ituations&mdash;have little or no vegetable food, wine, or other cordial drink, and are not &s;ufficiently cloathed&mdash;but it &s;ometimes ri&s;es in dry &s;oils and plea&s;ant &s;ituations, and attacks people who live in affluence&mdash;and hence becomes epide|mical, as was the ca&s;e in the &s;pring of the year 1760, in Hamp|&s;hire; for there it extended its influence in a mo&s;t amazing man|ner among&s;t all cla&s;&s;es of people.</P>
<P>From the con&s;ideration of the&s;e cau&s;es, it appears probable, and is generally allowed, that the &s;curvy ari&s;es in the body &s;pon|taneou&s;ly, in con&s;equence of &s;ome unknown changes in the at|mo&s;phere, which are more capable of generating &s;corbutic acri|mony, in proportion as there is a defect of &s;ound vegetable di|et, fermented liquors, and clean or &s;ufficient cloathing.</P>
<P>But though the combination &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to produce this di&s;ea&s;e in the &s;ounde&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t con&s;titutions, &s;till, in &s;uch habits as are weak, and naturally relaxed, dull, and &s;lothful, or which have been debilitated by any preceding malady, notwith|&s;tanding they live po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of generous and proper diet, with warm cloathing, experience convinces us, that from changes of the atmo&s;phere alone, in them this complaint will make its ap|pearance.</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Lo&s;s of &s;trength, bleeding of the gums, and different coloured &s;pots in the &s;kin, for the mo&s;t part livid, particularly at the roots of the hair&mdash;occurring in cold climates, mo&s;t frequently, after feeding on putrid or &s;alted ani|mal food, that of the vegetable cla&s;s being at the &s;ame time de|fective, particularly fre&s;h vegetables.</P>
<P>CURE. Dreadful as are the &s;ymptoms of this complaint, if the texture of the whole &s;y&s;tem of the &s;olids is not de&s;troyed they all give way to proper treatment. The indications of cure are, to attempt to promote the free excretion of the putrid humours by the inte&s;tines, kidneys, and &s;kin, le&s;t, by a &s;tagna|tion

<P>Every other day, in the beginning, a &s;weat &s;hould be rai&s;ed, by taking two or three times in twelve hours twelve grains of the &s;quill pill of the London or Edinburgh Di&s;pen&s;atories, or the camphorated bolus, (No. 158.)&mdash;the&s;e &s;hould be continued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome time, though the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould be much alleviated, to prevent a relap&s;e.</P>

It has been called CARSINOMA, from the Greek word <HI>karkinos,</HI> cancer, a crab, from its appearance, the turgid veins running round the margin of the tumors being &s;omething &s;imilar to crabs claws&mdash;and when a hard &s;cirrhous tumor begins to be unequal&mdash;puts on a livid colour&mdash;has acute darting pains &s;hooting through it&mdash;and at the &s;ame time veins &s;urrounding it being di&s;tended, and having a &s;erpentine appearance, called varico&s;e&mdash;the&s;e are &s;ymptoms con|&s;idered as declaratory of a cancer&mdash;but, indeed, &s;ometimes it will ari&s;e in the lips, gums, tongue, and &s;ome other parts of the body, without the appearance of &s;cirrhus preceding it.</P>

<P>Like &s;crophulous tumors cancerous ones are lumpy, unequal; but exceed the&s;e and every other &s;pecies of tumor in hardne&s;s, though, whil&s;t they remain in an indolent &s;tate, and without a|ny di&s;colouration in the &s;kin, they are termed SCIRRHI&mdash;when an itching is perceptible, &s;ucceeded by the darting pain we have before de&s;cribed, the &s;kin turns darki&s;h or livid, and the veins under the &s;kin put on a varico&s;e appearance (475.) in the part affected, they then are con&s;idered as CANCERS.</P>

<P>DESCRIPTION. To this complaint both &s;exes are equally liable&mdash;and it is generally allowed to manife&s;t it&s;elf in each in the following manner:</P>
<P>IN THE MEN&mdash;&s;ome days, from four to &s;ix, &s;eldom longer, af|ter the reception of the contagious matter, there ari&s;es not an unplea&s;ant titillation in the glands of the penis, (55.) in the ori|fice of the urethra, (54.) there appears a little thin liquid&mdash;&s;oon after which the orifice &s;wells, grows red, with a degree of heat, and is more than commonly open&mdash;in a &s;mall &s;pace of time there is a &s;en&s;ation in making water, hot and &s;calding, and &s;omething like the pricking of needles&mdash;a kind of matter, more vi&s;cid than the former, and in larger quantity, makes its appearance, i&s;&s;uing from the urethra&mdash;that when the di&s;ea&s;e is more violent in its attack, through the cour&s;e of the urethra, as far as the neck of the bladder, there is perceived a &s;ort of tightne&s;s or fullne&s;s, attended mo&s;t commonly with erections, more frequent and pain|ful than u&s;ual&mdash;the inflammation now begins to increa&s;e, if left to it&s;elf, every day, con&s;equently the heat and pain, and the di&s;|charge puts on a yellow or greeni&s;h appearance, &s;ometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with bloody &s;treaks&mdash;if the inflammation runs high, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> will not unfrequently be pains in the groins, te&s;ticles, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;&s;ometimes a &s;trangury, (367.) will come on, and the patient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> night will be tormented with erections, and a bending down wards of the penis, called CHORDEE.</P>
<P>At length all the&s;e &s;ymptoms grow milder as the inflamma|tion abates&mdash;the di&s;charge becomes white, and more uniform, and at la&s;t i&s;&s;ues from the urethra white and vi&s;cid like a find thread, gradually dimini&s;hing, 'till appearing, now and then on|ly, in drops, it totally cea&s;es.</P>
<P>This is the de&s;cription when it pur&s;ues its natural cour&s;e, ac|counted for by the inflammation receding by degrees.</P>
<P>IN THE WOMEN, it di&s;covers it&s;elf by a &s;en&s;e of itching at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the external orifice of the vagina, (51.) and a more than com|mon moi&s;ture&mdash;in a few days the parts begin to inflame, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hot, &s;well, and become very painful, occa&s;ioning a &s;calding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> making water, but not &s;o painful as in men&mdash;add to the&s;e, a di&s;|charge of virulent di&s;coloured muco-puriform matter makes its appearance; and, as the inflammation goes off, becomes white and more vi&s;cid, and by degrees entirely cea&s;es.</P>
<P>With the&s;e appearances, we &s;hould naturally conclude that a patient had received the virus; but this is not always the ca&s;e; for the very &s;ame may ri&s;e from other cau&s;es not a&s;&s;ociated with
<PB N="481" REF="028021_0477_0FD673DA6D561828">
the venereal taint, as very &s;evere exerci&s;e&mdash;hard riding, and immoderate drinking&mdash;the too copious u&s;e of very heating &s;ti|mulants, u&s;ing too cau&s;tic injection by way of prevention&mdash;or, in fine, whatever will bring on an inflammation of tho&s;e parts. I mention this, becau&s;e &s;ometimes, particularly when the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances ari&s;e in married people, it is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to make the proper di&s;tinction, to &s;ave the peace of a family&mdash;as I have &s;een that peace nearly de&s;troyed by the indi&s;cretion and ra&s;hne&s;s of a practitioner, pronouncing in a hu&s;band that di&s;|charge venereal, where the ties of connubial honour had never been infringed, and where the character of the wi&s;e was, with great ju&s;tice, un&s;ullied. In our opinions, therefore, we &s;hould be extremely cautious, and wait for the appearance of &s;ome un|equivocal &s;ymptom before we pronounce po&s;itively, particularly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e may be cured in the &s;ame manner as &s;hould be advi&s;ed in ca&s;es of &s;imple inflammation without any venereal taint.</P>
<P>This complaint we con&s;ider as a virulent muco-puriform gleet, ari&s;ing from irritation, produced by venereal virus, after impure concubinage, attended with inflammation of the urethra, a flux from thence of puriform mucus, and a heat or &s;calding in mak|ing water.</P>
<P>The common term CLAP ari&s;es from the old French word <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">pieres,</HI> which were &s;ingle &s;hops, kept and inhabited by &s;ingle pro&s;titutes, and generally confined to particular parts of the town.</P>
<P>CURE. The indications are, to take off the inflammation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> give &s;trength afterwards to the ve&s;&s;els, which have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">kened by too &s;trong action and di&s;ten&s;ion.</P>
<P>If, therefore, at the on&s;et of the di&s;ea&s;e, the patient is of a plethoric habit, &s;trong &s;tamina, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great va&s;cular irri|tability, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to bleeding and gentle aperients for two or three days, and plentiful dilution with watery fluids, &s;uch as barley-water, lin&s;eed-tea, mar&s;h-mallow-tea, or &s;olution of gum arabic in warm water&mdash;bathing the penis once or twice a day in warm milk and water, or poppy head decoction&mdash;keeping the glans clean, and &s;upporting the te&s;tes by a &s;u&s;pen|&s;or.</P>
<P>The opening medicines may be given occa&s;ionally, &s;o that two or three &s;tools may be procured every day, (No. 23, 24. 66. 97. 99, 135.) any of which, as be&s;t &s;uits the pati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nt, may be admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>After three or four days, when the di&s;charge begin to flow copiou&s;ly, we mu&s;t alleviate the inflammation by the &s;edative injection, (No. 164.) which &s;hould be thrown gently up the
<PB N="482" REF="028021_0478_0FD6741AE0480DA8">
urethra two or three times a day, and retained for &s;ome time after each operation&mdash;when this has been u&s;ed for four or five days, or &s;ometimes longer, 'till the painful &s;ymptoms appear to be yielding, and the di&s;charge alters its colour, and grows more vi&s;cid, to this may be added &s;ix or eight grains of acetated ce|ru&s;s, and applied in the &s;ame manner, and in a few days more the cure will be often completed&mdash;but the di&s;charge in &s;ome ca&s;es will be of longer duration, from the relaxed &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;els, brought on by the preceding inflammation&mdash;when this is the ca&s;e, the di&s;charge is much whiter, or clear&mdash;the con&s;i&s;t|ence vi&s;cid and ropy, under which circum&s;tances, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the re&s;tringent injection, (No. 165.) or that made with calomel, (No. 166.) for this acts as a local &s;timulant, and may therefore be &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>But though this method will generally &s;ucceed, there is &s;ometimes one &s;ymptom extremely trouble&s;ome, and calls for particular attention, &s;hould it be violent, which belongs to the fir&s;t &s;tage of this complaint, that is, the CHORDEE, &s;o called from the Greek word <HI>korde</HI>&mdash;this is a contraction of the un|der part of the penis, which, when it is erected, and only then, is painful, and feels as if pulled down with a chord&mdash;this pain is chiefly under the froenum, (a membranous ligament under the penis, which ties the praepuce to the glans,) and along the duct of the urethra, for the alleviation of this &s;ymptom, low living is particularly nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;gentle exerci&s;e&mdash;avoiding all inebriating liquids&mdash;la&s;civious conver&s;ation, and the company of lewd women&mdash;the penis may be bathed often in a day with warm milk and water, or the &s;edative fomentation, (No. 11<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.) may be u&s;ed, keeping the glans covered with the praepuce du|ring the operation&mdash;and poultices of bread and milk may be ap|plied to the parts.</P>
<P>Bleeding with leeches upon the part has been highly u&s;eful&mdash;wearing tight drawers, by which means the penis may be confined downwards to the thigh, and erections prevented, which greatly aggravate the painful affection.</P>
<P>Sometimes it will happen, that, from the violence of the ir|ritation, the &s;ecretion of the mucus &s;eems to be totally &s;u&s;pend|ed, or, at lea&s;t, con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, &s;o that no di&s;charge, or only a very trifling one, takes place, though the other &s;ymp|toms rage with great violence, under the&s;e circum&s;tances we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to bleeding, emollient applications, fomen|tations, (No. 85 or 111.) and poultices, the&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary to abate the irritation, and bring on the di&s;charge&mdash;and here al&s;o opiates are nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;afterwards we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the &s;ame remedies as we have before &s;pecified.</P>

<P>But when the virus is ab&s;orbed into the habit, it gives ri&s;e to to variety of complaints, which have received various appel|lations from the parts affected, but are all owing to one and the &s;ame cau&s;e. The di&s;ea&s;e then is con&s;idered as the POX, or LUES VENEREA, which may be communicated to the habit, wherever the venereal virus gets in&s;inuated into any part which is wounded or ulcerated, or from ulcers formed by its own a|crimony, or from parts being touched by it where the &s;kin is abraded&mdash;and the places where the acrimony fir&s;t makes its entrance, are tho&s;e where the di&s;ea&s;e in general fir&s;t makes it appearance&mdash;and as coition is the mo&s;t common way of con|tracting it, &s;o the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms mo&s;t frequently appear &s;ome|where upon the genitals.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. We may ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pect that the virus is diffu&s;ed through the general ma&s;s of lymph, if the local &s;ymptoms, &s;uch as &s;hankers, buboes, &amp;c. do not give way to the u&s;ual methods of cure, or, when cured, if they break out again without fre&s;h contagion&mdash;but if, at the &s;ame time, we find ulcers breaking out in the throat, dry &s;cabby eruptions on the &s;kin, or hard callous tubercles, or pu&s;tules covered with a yellow &s;cab, and appearing chiefly on the hairy parts, we may be certain that the ca&s;e is confirmed.</P>
<P>But &s;ometimes the&s;e &s;ymptoms appear without any di&s;ea&s;e of the genitals, and may be produced by other &s;pecies of acri|mony&mdash;it may be nece&s;&s;ary to give what we con&s;idered their characteri&s;tic appearance.</P>
<P><HI>Venereal eruptions</HI> have a branny appearance, and are &s;uperfi|cial, unattended with itching, and the &s;cales being picked off, the &s;kin appears of a reddi&s;h brown, or rather copper colour underneath.</P>
<P>The <HI>tubercles</HI> or <HI>pu&s;tules,</HI> &s;eldom occupy the cheeks or the no&s;e, nor have a purulent apex, but are covered at top, either with a dry branny &s;curf, like the eruptions ju&s;t mentioned, or el&s;e with a hard dry &s;cab of a tawny yellow colour; they par|ticularly break out among&s;t the hair, or near it, on the fore|head or temples.</P>

<P><HI>With re&s;pect to pains,</HI> tho&s;e which are deep &s;eated, particular|ly of the arms, head, and &s;hins, always fixed in the &s;ame place, and which affect the middle and more &s;olid part of the bones of the arms and legs, and tho&s;e of the head, raging chiefly and with great violence in the fore part of the night, may be held as &s;ure &s;igns of this di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;but other wandering pains of the membranes of the mu&s;cles, and the ligaments of the joints, though they may ari&s;e from a venereal taint, they cannot be con&s;idered as certain &s;igns without other &s;ymptoms of the lues are apparent at the &s;ame time.</P>

<P>The remote &s;ymptoms ari&s;e, and the more they affect the bones, &s;o much the more difficult the cure; becau&s;e the venereal virus appears to occupy the minute parts of the habit, and be very univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed through the humours&mdash;but the malady becomes incurable if the virus affects the brain, the lungs, the liver, or any of the nobler internal parts, the patients will either &s;ink under that con&s;umption called tabes, or die apoplec|tic.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>inducing</HI> are, all tho&s;e applications which inflame or dry up local venereal ulcerations, whether a&s;tringent given internally, or exhibited externally, or the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of buboes without the exhibition of mercury.</P>
<P>CURE. The indication is, to free the habit from the vene|real contagion, which may always be done by mercury in &s;ome &s;hape or other, either alone, or combined with &s;ome other me|dicines, which the peculiarity of the con&s;titution may demand, as in every &s;pecies of this complaint, or every complaint ari&s;ing from this &s;ource, where we are called in before the virus has got firmly rooted in &s;ome of the more noble organs of vitality.</P>
<P>Different practitioners have been fond of different prepara|tions of mercury, and different modes of throwing it into the ha|bit.</P>
<P>Some advi&s;e calomel to be rubbed on the in&s;ide of the lips, or cheek, to the quantity of four grains every day, and let it be ta|ken into the habit by the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Others prefer the mercurial ointme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, (No. 167.) from half a dram to two drams to be rubbed on the in&s;ide of the thighs a|bove the knee once or twice a day for &s;ome &s;pace of time, 'till all the venereal &s;ymptoms vani&s;h.</P>
<P>Some have been fond of calcined mercury, (160.) and opium, half a grain of each formed into a pill, and taken night and morning, with a decoction of the woods, (No. 88.) increa&s;ing the do&s;e to a grain each or more.</P>
<P>Others have given the preference to the corro&s;ive &s;ublimate &s;olution, (No. 168.) mixed with half a pint of barley water, or decoction of the woods, (No. 88.) to be taken night and morn|ing.</P>
<P>The patients &s;hould lie in bed to &s;weat after taking the medi|cine, and they ought to drink plentifully of whey, barley-wa|ter,
<PB N="486" REF="028021_0482_0FD6741DF8FEC260">
o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome &s;uch liquid, throughout the day&mdash;and if the medi|cine acts not as a gentle aperient, a mild purge may be given occa&s;ionally. It has been ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e whom it purges two or three times a day get well &s;ooner than tho&s;e whom it does not purge&mdash;it very &s;eldom affects the mouth, but promotes di&s;charge by urine and the &s;kin. This cour&s;e is to be continu|ed &s;ome weeks after all the &s;ymptoms di&s;appear&mdash;and the de|coction of the woods &s;hould be taken for &s;ome time after the &s;o|lution is left off.</P>
<P>Some prefer the &s;ublimate pills, (No. 169.) under the idea of their being more ea&s;ily and &s;afely taken in greater quantity, and from the &s;tomach bearing it better in this way; for the pills, gradually di&s;&s;olving, are &s;aid not to affect the &s;tomach &s;ud|denly as the &s;olution drank.</P>
<P>However, I think quick&s;ilver mechanically divided into its mo&s;t minute parts, which art is capable of completing, the be&s;t mode of admini&s;tration, as in the mercurial gummous &s;olution, (No. 170.) or the mercurial gummous pill, (No. 171.) as the form be&s;t plea&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;eldom produce &s;alivation, if &s;ome purgative is exhi|bited every tenth day, and are &s;aid quickly, &s;afely, and plea|&s;antly to take off all the effects of venereal virus, where no chirurgical operation is nece&s;&s;ary, and then to be highly u&s;eful in expediting the cure; for by this mode of admini&s;tration, a &s;ufficient quantity of this powerful medicine may be thrown into the habit with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, without producing tho&s;e violent effects the &s;aline mercurials are very apt to occa&s;ion&mdash;and, perhaps, it is from this power of filling the habit by the&s;e mild means upon which its &s;uperior efficacy depends.</P>
<P>For children, where mercury is nece&s;&s;ary to be given, the mercurial &s;yrup, (No. 172.) for obvious rea&s;ons, claims the preference.</P>
<P>Where mercury given in the&s;e modes &s;ail, which, under pro|per management, it rarely does, corro&s;ive &s;ublimate has been recommended&mdash;e&s;teemed by many the mo&s;t preferable prepa|ration in venereal di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;kin, and tho&s;e of the bones.</P>
<P>Some ca&s;es there are, however, which will not yield to mer|cury alone, and &s;ome where &s;ucce&s;s has been derived by vary|ing from time to time the mercurial preparations admini&s;tered, and conjoining them frequently with cicuta&mdash;admini&s;tering &s;ar|&s;aparilla decoction, that of mezereon, (No. 173.) or bark with chalybeates, or cooling medicines, opiates, anti&s;pa&s;modics, or cordials, &s;uch as the con&s;titutional circum&s;tances required. But here the &s;agacity of the practitioner mu&s;t be left to make the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinction, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to point out up upon
<PB N="487" REF="028021_0483_0FD673E647B3C188">
paper preci&s;ely the deviations which may occur. We &s;hall on|ly ob&s;erve, that where the di&s;ea&s;e re&s;i&s;ts the modes we have laid down, the practitioner mu&s;t labour to find the con&s;titutional defect, and combine with mercury other remedies appropriated to its relief.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there are now and then &s;ome venereal &s;ymptoms which will remain, notwith&s;tanding the mercurial cour&s;e being properly per&s;i&s;ted in, &s;uch as nodes, and &s;wellings of the perio|&s;teum&mdash;the&s;e are &s;ometimes cured by the mezereon decoction, (No. 173.) or the compound one of &s;ar&s;aparilla per&s;i&s;ted in for a long continuance of time, which will be aided much by the warmth of a &s;outhern clime. As for other local affections, &s;ur|gical a&s;&s;i&s;tance is not immediately nece&s;&s;ary; for healing up of &s;hankers, and di&s;cu&s;&s;ing buboes by too ha&s;ty external applica|tions, has often created mi&s;chief&mdash;cleanline&s;s and dry lint, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and depending on internal remedies for the cure of both, is by much the &s;ounde&s;t practice, and will almo&s;t always an&s;wer, if the complaints are &s;imply venereal&mdash;if other|wi&s;e, and they ob&s;tinately re&s;i&s;t this mode, the &s;kill of a &s;urge|on may become a nece&s;&s;ary auxiliary.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to a &s;alivation, it is &s;eldom, if ever at all, nece&s;&s;a|ry&mdash;however, if it is determined on, before the cour&s;e is be|gun, &s;hould the patient be of a full habit, it is advi&s;eable to take away &s;ome blood&mdash;have recour&s;e to the warm or vapour lath, two or three times, and clear the &s;tomach and bowels with a do&s;e of gentle phy&s;ic&mdash;then let the patient put on a flannel &s;hirt&mdash;and half a dram of mercurial ointment, (No. 167.) mu&s;t be rubbed in on the in&s;ide of the thighs every evening, gradually increa&s;ing the quantity to two drams, or more, if the con&s;titution requires it, 'till a &s;pitting is brought on&mdash;and this mu&s;t be kept up for a fortnight after every venereal &s;ymptom has di&s;appeared&mdash;the patient &s;hould drink plentifully of &s;ome diluting liquid, as barley water with gum arabic, mar&s;h-mal|low tea, or &s;uch like&mdash;and per&s;i&s;t in a light, ea&s;ily dige&s;tible diet&mdash;avoid the cool air&mdash;and &s;pit from a pint to a quart e|very day&mdash;the more gradually the &s;alivation is brought on the better.</P>
<P>If we want to prevent the mercury from laying too &s;trong hold of the mouth, it mu&s;t be diverted to the &s;kin, by keeping the patient in a con&s;tant &s;tate of per&s;piration, from the warmth of the room, by drinking plentifully of warm, diluting watery liquids&mdash;or, &s;hould he wi&s;h to avoid a &s;pitting, the patient &s;hould take from time to time &s;ome gentle phy&s;ic, or get into a vapour bath&mdash;and this mode is thought by &s;ome the mo&s;t ad|vi&s;eable, as by the&s;e means we &s;hall be enabled to throw in a

large quantity of mercury&mdash;if inflammatory &s;ymptoms occur, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to bleeding, and confine the patient to a low diet, and copious dilution with watery mucilaginous flu|ids&mdash;but &s;hould the &s;trength be much reduced, a nouri&s;hing diet, with wine, infu&s;ion of bark, and &s;ome chalybeate prepara|tion, and a free country air, are peoper.</P>
<P>After the cour&s;e is completed, and the cure performed, the patients &s;hould return to their u&s;ual modes of living, as has been repeatedly recommended, when recovering from any a|cute di&s;ea&s;e that has much harra&s;&s;ed the con&s;titution.</P>

<P>WE now are to treat of di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;kin&mdash;&s;ome of which are con&s;idered merely as local complaints of the &s;kin it|&s;elf, beginning in, and not extending them&s;elves farther than that part of the machine; whil&s;t others depend on acrid &s;tates of the humours, and are more generally diffu&s;ive through the habit, putting on different appearances, according to the parts they affect, and very often alternating with tho&s;e on the &s;kin; &s;o that, on the expul&s;ion of the acrimonious humours, they manife&s;t them&s;elves on the exterior &s;urface of the machine; and on being expelled, occa&s;ion internal affections.</P>
<P>We &s;hall, therefore, form this cla&s;s of complaints into two divi&s;ions, after particularizing &s;ome, and from thence deduce our general modes of cure.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, of the</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="disease">
<HEAD>&sect; 1. ITCH;</HEAD>
<P>&s;o called from the effect it produces. Different are the cau&s;es from which this complaint may ari&s;e, as the &s;curvy, &s;o called, lues venerea, &amp;c.&mdash;but as the&s;e eruptions are only &s;ymptomatic, when thus derived, we &s;hall confine our&s;elves to the common itch.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. This is di&s;coverable by &s;mall &s;pots about the &s;ize of a millet &s;eed, or &s;omewhat larger, which, broken by &s;cratching, form a &s;cab, itch violently&mdash;it is contagious, and chief|ly affects the hands.</P>
<P>This di&s;order chiefly begins between the fingers&mdash;red, hot ve|&s;icles, full of acrid &s;erum, make their appearance, to which,
<PB N="489" REF="028021_0485_0FD673E652AA3E78">
by &s;cratching, dry, rough &s;cabs, attended with great itching, &s;uc|ceed.</P>
<P>But this, according to the &s;tate of humours being more or le&s;s in a bland or acrimonious &s;tate, puts on different appearances&mdash;hence the &s;pots, in&s;tead of being merely ve&s;icular, will have here and there appearances of matter contained in them, e&s;peci|ally if the di&s;ea&s;e has been of any continuance, and the patients very dirty&mdash;however, we may in general di&s;cover &s;ome &s;pots manife&s;ting the true itch, particularly in the places where there is the mo&s;t warmth, as between the fingers, in the bend of the arm, under the arm-pit, in the interior part below the knee.</P>
<P>Children are more &s;ubject to it than adults&mdash;delicate habits with &s;oft &s;mooth &s;kins, and adults more than old people&mdash;all which is owing to the &s;oftne&s;s and moi&s;ture of the &s;kin, and quick|er &s;en&s;ibility of that part in one than another.</P>
<P>The CAUSE is univer&s;ally believed to be, animalculae in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">kin&mdash;and, from the idea of this complaint &s;o founded, a number of the appearances is readily and &s;atisfactorily accounted for, as why it is attended with itching, why caught by contagion&mdash;and why it returns after &s;ometimes being cured.</P>
<P>The itching is occa&s;ioned by the&s;e animalculae irritating the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">res in the places where they are lodged&mdash;hence rai&s;ing a very minute bli&s;ter, which, provoking us to &s;cratch, is bur&s;t, and &s;e|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> then oozes out and forms a &s;cab&mdash;and the&s;e animalculae run|ning under the cuticle, or &s;carf &s;kin, (25.) depo&s;it their eggs in va|rious parts; which, by the heat of the machine, are hatched, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s the di&s;ea&s;e &s;preads it&s;elf&mdash;by contagion, it is communicated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by the animalculae them&s;elves getting from the affected to the &s;ound per&s;on&mdash;or from touching any &s;oft &s;ub&s;tance where they may be lodged&mdash;or from the per&s;on receiving &s;ome of the eggs upon the cuticle, which are rubbed into the furrows, and there lay a proper time for producing their young&mdash;and probably its return may be owing to the eggs not being totally de&s;troyed in &s;uch as were affected, and apparently cured.</P>
<P>Sometimes little prominent &s;pots, itching and crowding toge|ther, neither excoriated nor &s;cabby, will affect the &s;kin, from a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ntion of acrid per&s;pirable matter, made more acrimonious by &s;tagnating in the &s;mall cryptae, hollow places like cavities, con|taining &s;ome fluid, and &s;mall glands, called &s;ebaceous glands, of the &s;kin and face&mdash;the&s;e are called TETTERS or HERPES, from <HI>erpo,</HI> repo, to creep, becau&s;e they creep from place to place, and, like the former, are only inherent in the part affected, and do not contaminate the ma&s;s of fluids.</P>

Now, the tinea and lepro&s;y we take to depend upon &s;ome acri|monious humour diffu&s;ed through the habit, and, by the efforts of nature, depo&s;ited upon the &s;kin.</P>
<P>According, then, to the cau&s;es and con&s;titutional circum&s;tances do we form our indications of cure; for having not, in the ITCH and TETTER here recited, occa&s;ion to fear any ill con&s;equences to be derived from repelling any humour into the habit, and the cau&s;es creating them being merely external, external applications will be &s;ufficient to form a radical cure, at lea&s;t very trifling a&s;|&s;i&s;tance will be requi&s;ite from internal remedies&mdash;whil&s;t in the SCALD HEAD and LEPROSY, &s;uch internal remedies are nece&s;&s;ary as will clear the habit of tho&s;e acrimonious humours, by pro|moting regularly and con&s;tantly &s;ome of the natural evacuations, particularly that of per&s;piration and urine, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;o &s;upporting the &s;trength of the &s;y&s;tem, and e&s;pecially that of the dige&s;tive powers, that &s;oft, mild, nutritious fluids may &s;up|ply the place of tho&s;e which are evacuated, and the di&s;po&s;ition which the con&s;titution has to generate acrimony &s;o offen&s;ive may be altered as much as in the power of medical aid to accom|pli&s;h&mdash;and indeed the &s;ame modes will hold good in all the va|riety of eruptive complaints, unattended with any fever of mo|ment, which are of long continuance, and come under the de|nomination of land &s;curvy, &amp;c. and which we have not before &s;pecified.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to exemplify the different modes, we &s;hall proceed to &s;peak of the cure of the four ju&s;t now mention|ed&mdash;and, fir&s;t, of the itch, who&s;e</P>
<P>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS are, pu&s;tules, or itching &s;mall ulcers, contagious, and chiefly affecting the hands, from &s;mall animalculae irritating the &s;kin below the cuticle.</P>
<P>CURE. In &s;trong robu&s;t con&s;titutions, it may be advi&s;eable to take away &s;ome blood, and give a do&s;e or two of gentle phy&s;ic&mdash;then let the &s;kin be well cleaned, by going into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> warm bath, and afterwards have recour&s;e to &s;ome of the appli|cations, (from No. 174 to 177.)&mdash;With regard to &s;ulphur, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that what is called &s;ulphur vivum is preferable in the&s;e ca&s;es as an external application, becau&s;e, in forming flowers, it lo&s;es much of its efficacy&mdash;the flowers are al&s;o order|ed to be taken internally, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;ome of the animalculae might be too deep-&s;eated for the ointment to af|fect them, hence might they be reached by the &s;treams pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;kin&mdash;indeed, coupled with a little cream of tartar it makes an agreeable opening and diaphoretic medicine.</P>
<P>With the mercurial wa&s;h and ointment it will be &s;ufficient to wa&s;h or anoint the parts affected, or to rub &s;ome of the latte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="493" REF="028021_0489_0FD673E7C7F87378">
into the palms of the hands or wri&s;ts&mdash;and it would be right now and then to take &s;ome gentle phy&s;ic, and drink copiou&s;ly of &s;ome aqueous liquid, to prevent the mercury from affecting the mouth.</P>
<P>If the complaint proves ob&s;tinate, as it will &s;ometimes do if it is of the dry &s;pecies, warm baths may be u&s;ed during the external applications, and &s;mall do&s;es of antimonials, (180) and mercurials, (160.) exhibited with a decoction of the woods, (No. 88, 89.)&mdash;but the&s;e are &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary, though they are u&s;eful as auxiliaries, where the acrid &s;tate of the humours is a concomitant. Notwith&s;tanding mercurials have been advi&s;ed, and almo&s;t always &s;ucceed in the cure of this complaint, there have been in&s;tances where it has continued, even after the pati|ent has gone through a &s;alivation&mdash;under the&s;e circum&s;tances, where mercury has not been efficacious, &s;ulphur is our dernier re&s;ort.</P>
<P>With regard to the herpes or tetter, it is cured by topical ap|plications, and of &s;uch kinds as by their &s;timulus and a&s;tringency give &s;trength and firmne&s;s to the part affected, &s;o that the mat|ter of per&s;piration is made to pa&s;s off freely, and prevented from accumulating on account of the weakne&s;s and relaxed &s;tate of the places wherein the complaint manife&s;ts it&s;elf&mdash;of reme|dies of this &s;ort there are a great variety, &s;uch as ink, water of kali, oil from burnt paper, rags or wood which is acrid; this is to be diluted with fa&s;ting &s;aliva, and the part affected anoint|ed with it&mdash;but the mo&s;t preferable is a wa&s;h formed of ten grains of muriated quick&s;ilver di&s;&s;olved in a pint of water; &s;o|lutions of the preparations of lead, (139.) have been in the milder kind of this di&s;ea&s;e u&s;eful and efficacious.</P>
<P>The TIENA, or SCALD HEAD, that &s;pecies to which we con|fine our&s;elves, has for its CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS, &s;mall ulcers in the &s;kin of the hairy &s;calp, at the roots of the hair, oozing out a humour running into a white, dryi&s;h &s;cab&mdash;when this happens to children otherwi&s;e apparently healthy, the bo|dy &s;hould be kept open with mild aperients, &s;uch as magne&s;ia and rhubarb, or Polychre&s;t &s;alt, in properly proportioned do&s;es; the hair kept clo&s;e cut and &s;hort&mdash;the parts clean, by wa&s;hing them with &s;oap and water&mdash;and a moderate diet pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Indeed, it is u&s;ually cured by weaning the child, or changing the nur&s;e, who&s;e milk is younger, thinner, and le&s;s loaded with oily matter.</P>
<P>The&s;e children get the teeth later, and with more difficulty&mdash;their bowels are co&s;tive&mdash;and often there appears a propen&s;ity to rickets&mdash;without the eruption &s;hould be imprudently repel|led, nothing el&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary to be done&mdash;but if it &s;hould be

attended with an acrimony of the humours, and &s;preads it&s;elf to different parts of the body, a young nur&s;e &s;hould be cho&s;en who&s;e milk is bland and well diluted, not rich and thick; &s;he therefore &s;hould live on liquid or moi&s;tening food; at the &s;ame time, if re&s;tle&s;s, gentle opiates may be now and then given to procure &s;leep.</P>
<P>Should this complaint prove ob&s;tinate, and be attended with great itching, a palene&s;s of the countenance, and the fle&s;hy parts appear relaxed and flabby, here we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to &s;mall do&s;es of calomel, as an alterative, and antimonial wine, with the &s;ame intent, proportioning the do&s;es to the &s;tate of the &s;to|mach and bowels, that the one may not purge, nor the other occa&s;ion too con&s;tant &s;ickne&s;s or nau&s;ea.</P>
<P>To allay the itching, the head mu&s;t be rubbed with oil of &s;weet almonds&mdash;&s;everal recommend the pitch ointment of the Edinburgh Di&s;pen&s;atory, which I have found effectual&mdash;cream mixed with chalk in fine powder&mdash;&s;olutions of the preparations of lead, and that of muriated quick&s;ilver, as in ca&s;e of tetter, may be had recour&s;e to.</P>
<P>In every eruption of tettery kind to which children are lia|ble, of which the &s;cald head we con&s;ider one, Mr. Bell a&s;&s;erts, the &s;ulphur, in &s;ome form or other, commonly proves the mo&s;t effectual application, therefore, in failure of other remedies, &s;ul|phur &s;hould be employed.</P>
<P>However, of the&s;e remedies I &s;hould recommend a very cau|tious u&s;e, becau&s;e I have &s;een great mi&s;chiefs occur from the injudicious application of &s;timulants and repellents in &s;ome ca|&s;es, from the idea of the complaint being merely cuticular, bor|rowing nothing from the habit in general&mdash;indeed, &s;o obvious has it been, that &s;oon after the repul&s;ion of the humour, coughs, and febrile &s;ymptoms have come on&mdash;unea&s;ine&s;s in the bowels&mdash;perceptible emaciation, which, upon the reappearance of the complaint, have all gone off&mdash;in a country town, where it was the practice of the old women to cure the &s;cald head with pep|per and butter, it very often proved fatal.</P>
<P>I &s;hould therefore advi&s;e that cleanline&s;s, change of nur&s;es, or weaning, with the u&s;e of gentle purgatives, &s;hould be fir&s;t tried&mdash;if the&s;e &s;ucceed not, the u&s;e of alteratives and antimonials, or the ponderous muriated earth, &s;hould be tried for &s;ome time, and i&s;&s;ues, before recour&s;e &s;hould be had to any of the preparations of lead, mercury, or &s;ulphur, then they might be tried with &s;afe|ty, as I have from experience been convinced&mdash;and the&s;e i&s;&s;ues &s;hould be continued 'till the complaint be totally cured, and the con&s;titution has recovered its u&s;ual &s;trength and firmne&s;s&mdash;when this has been repelled, it has been thought advi&s;eable to endea|vour

to &s;olicit the complaint back again, if any internal &s;ymp|toms manife&s;ted them&s;elves, which, it is &s;aid, may be done by the application of the leaves of bete to the part originally affected; but of this I have had no experience&mdash;it might, however, be tri|ed, whil&s;t the other internal remedies above recommended to car|ry off the humour were per&s;i&s;ted in.</P>
<P>In the CURE of the LEPROSY, who&s;e CHARACTERISTIC SYMPTOMS are, the &s;kin rough, with white e&s;chars, which have a branny appearance, and are chapped&mdash;&s;ometimes moi&s;t underneath and itching&mdash;warm baths, a clear pure air, with a thin laxative diet, are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;and al&s;o the u&s;e of antimonials and mercurials&mdash;though a &s;alivation exa&s;perates this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ix grains of calomel, with one of camphor, may be ex|hibited once a week, and purged off with a common purging draught in the morning.</P>
<P>Dr. RUSSEL a&s;&s;erts, he cured the dry lepro&s;y in the cour&s;e of a month, by giving a bolus made of the fle&s;h of vipers, twen|ty grains, and one of camphor, with a little con&s;erve of ro&s;es, every night, and the morning following half a pint of &s;ea-water&mdash;viper broth, or chicken broth with vipers, has been con&s;idered as beneficial&mdash;but the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s has been attributed to the decoction of the interior part of the elm-tree, (No. 178.) which &s;hould be continued &s;everal weeks&mdash;and &s;hould, by its u&s;e, the efflore&s;cences be augmented, it is a plea&s;ing &s;ymptom, as it pro|mi&s;es a &s;alutary termination.</P>
<P>We have had in&s;tances of this complaint, where the &s;ymptoms have put on a high degree of violence, being cured by bark and &s;a&s;&s;afras, (No. 179.) and the application of a &s;timulant lotion, (No. 180.) night and morning, a perpetual bli&s;ter being at the &s;ame time kept open between the &s;houlders.</P>
<P>In complaints of this cla&s;s I have found great benefit from the judicious u&s;e of mercurials and antimonials, intermediately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the ponderous muriated earth, with the compound de|coction of &s;ar&s;aparilla of the London Di&s;pen&s;atory&mdash;to a quart of which I have occa&s;ionally added &s;ix drams of Peruvian bark.</P>
<P>Indeed, in all eruptive complaints which are united with, and proceed from an acrimony of the fluids internally diffu&s;ed, and manife&s;t them&s;elves by &s;ymptoms which be&s;peak general affec|tions of the habit, or internal local ones, I &s;hould recommend the gentle evacuating and tonic plain, on the principles we have &s;pecified in the former part of this &s;ection; and &s;hall now pro|ceed to &s;peak of &s;ome complaints which have been detached from the general arrangement intentionally, and one accidentally o|mitted.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; 1. INFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB.</HEAD>
<P>DESCRIPTION. This complaint is attended with heat, ten|&s;ion, &s;welling, and pain in the lower part of the belly&mdash;vo|miting, the mouth of the womb is &s;o painful, that it cannot bear touch, and is drawn inwards&mdash;there is a continued fever, &s;ome|times of the remittent kind, accompanied with chillne&s;s, deliri|um, to&s;&s;ing about of the body&mdash;the head, though chiefly the fore part, is painful, and al&s;o the eyes&mdash;convul&s;ions of the neck, hands, and feet come on&mdash;the pain extends it&s;elf to the groins, thighs, midriff, and collar bones, a&s;&s;ociated with difficulty of breathing and pleuritic &s;ymptoms;&mdash;nau&s;ea, vomiting, hiccough, co&s;tive|ne&s;s&mdash;and pain in making water al&s;o manife&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the beginning the pul&s;e is full and quick, afterwards weak and frequent&mdash;to which are joined faintings, coldne&s;s of the ex|tremities, drow&s;ine&s;s, with a number of other dangerous and vio|lent &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The womb may be affected with this complaint from all tho&s;e cau&s;es which are apt to induce inflammatory af|fections in other parts. (See Inflammation, p. 298, &amp;c.)&mdash;ob|&s;tructed men&s;es&mdash;or any thing which will determine the blood too freely to the womb, and create an accumulation more than naturally large in that organ. But authors have very judici|ou&s;ly divided it into three &s;pecies&mdash;1&s;t, Into that which affects lying-in women&mdash;2d, That which is attended with a malig|nant fever&mdash;and, 3d, That which deduces its origin from the milk.</P>
<P>IN THE FIRST OF THESE, a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of lochia often pre|cedes the complaint, or it is brought on by violent efforts of the accoucheur in difficult labours, blows, compre&s;&s;ion, laceration from the fingers, or the u&s;e of in&s;truments, retention of coagu|lated blood, and great force exerted in replacing a prolap&s;us, or falling down of the womb.</P>
<P>CURE. Now, where only the &s;ymptoms of common inflam|mation are the concomitants, &s;uch as local pain, heat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and the pul&s;e full, quick, and hard, bleeding mu&s;t be had re|cour&s;e to&mdash;fomentations and poultices&mdash;the patient &s;hould drink copiou&s;ly of watery fluids&mdash;and take of nitrous, &s;aline, and anti|monial
<PB N="497" REF="028021_0493_0FD673EAB3C92808">
medicines&mdash;and, in fine, the method pur&s;ued as in other inflammatory ca&s;es. (See Inflammation, &amp;c.) Be&s;ides, here, all external pre&s;&s;ure is to be avoided&mdash;if nece&s;&s;ary, the urine mu&s;t be drawn off by the catheter, and the rectum, (45.) emptied by gly&s;ters occa&s;ionally;&mdash;but if the complaint ari&s;es from a &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of the lochia, and, notwith&s;tanding all our efforts, the pain &s;hould continue opiates may &s;ometimes be given with &s;uc|ce&s;s; for this may proceed from &s;ome &s;pa&s;modic affections, oc|ca&s;ioned by irritation.</P>
<P>THE SECOND mo&s;t commonly proceeds from internal cau&s;es, as putrid acrid matter, or a tran&s;lation of that which creates ery|&s;ipelas to the uterus, di&s;coverable by a burning heat internally&mdash;delirium, black dry tongue, and at the &s;ame time coldne&s;s of the extremities, with a frequent and irregular pul&s;e.</P>
<P>CURE. Here are required a freer u&s;e of opiates and diapho|retics, to determine the fluids to the &s;kin, and evacuate the of|fending matter, becau&s;e the&s;e ca&s;es &s;eem more to depend upon irritating cau&s;es than mere inflammations&mdash;the patients, there|fore, &s;hould be kept much in bed, moderately warm&mdash;drink free|ly of barley water, thin gruel, and the&s;e frequently repeated&mdash;go occa&s;ionally into the warm baths&mdash;and gentle diaphore|tics, (180.) &s;hould be in&s;i&s;ted upon, as antimonials in &s;mall do&s;es, acetated ammonia, (180, 181.) nitre, (176.) and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>THE THIRD, is an acute febrile di&s;ea&s;e, attended with a &s;well|ing of the belly&mdash;ten&s;ion, pain of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, thir&s;t, head-ach, delirium, dryne&s;s of the tongue&mdash;di&s;turbed &s;leep, although the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">chia flow freely&mdash;and this inflammation &s;ometimes precedes, &s;ometimes &s;ucceeds delivery.</P>
<P>CURE. Here we &s;hould pur&s;ue the mode &s;imilar to what we have laid down its inte&s;tinal inflammation&mdash;large evacuations, by bleeding, purging, with diuretics, and a thin &s;pare regimen&mdash;the milk al&s;o &s;hould be &s;olicited into the brea&s;ts by every po&s;|&s;ible means, &s;etting the child early to the brea&s;ts, applying cup|ping gla&s;&s;es, &s;aline mixtures, and antimonial preparations, given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> proper intervals, and the brea&s;ts kept warm.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to bleeding, &s;ome have thought it unnece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e of the di&s;charge of the lochia; but in this ca&s;e a larger quantity by much than what flows in that ca&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary to be taken, that death may be avoided, and the depo&s;ition of milk in the abdomen, or a milk ab&s;ce&s;s, may be prevented;&mdash;for this di&s;|ea&s;e has been &s;aid to be fatal to many women&mdash;and in opening <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> bodies of tho&s;e who have died of this di&s;ea&s;e, a milky, thin, or grumous matter, to the quantity of a pint, has been effu&s;ed in the abdomen.</P>
<P><PB N="498" REF="028021_0494_0FD67429CED8A4D8">
But if the fever &s;hould be moderate, the lochia, &s;weats, and flow of milk into the brea&s;ts proper and natural&mdash;there &s;hould be no &s;welling of the abdomen&mdash;no head-ach, particularly if there &s;hould be a loo&s;ene&s;s and bilious &s;tools, it will be &s;ufficient to &s;upport the&s;e evacuations by drinking copiou&s;ly mild thin gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&mdash;taking oily medicines, and the u&s;e of &s;heathing gly&s;ters. See PUERPERAL FEVER. (243.)</P>
<P>Now, from the accounts given of the&s;e three &s;pecies, the in|dications of cure are plainly pointed out to us. IN THE FIRST, we endeavour to take off the inflammation by the common mode directed for &s;ubduing inflammatory complaints of other parts. IN THE SECOND, we attempt to evacuate the acrimony. And IN THE LAST, to prevent the coagulation of the milk, or its effu|&s;ion into parts for which it is not de&s;tined by nature, by &s;olicit|ing into and keeping it in its natural re&s;ervoirs.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; 3. LEUCORRHOEA;</HEAD>
<P>&s;o called from the Greek <HI>leukos,</HI> albos, white, and <HI>reo,</HI> fluo, to flow, becau&s;e of the di&s;charge being generally of a white co|lour&mdash;al&s;o FLUOR ALBUS, white flux&mdash;it is vulgarly called the WHITES, for the &s;ame rea&s;on&mdash;this is a di&s;charge of &s;erous or mucous matter, &s;ometimes white, or others yellowi&s;h, brown|i&s;h, or rather greeni&s;h, from the womb and vagina.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION. At fir&s;t this di&s;charge is mild and &s;erous, which afterwards, by not pa&s;&s;ing freely off, or &s;tagnating, becomes more thick and acrimonious, and will be different with regard to its colour and &s;mell&mdash;indeed, tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which we have enumerated as concomitants to a morbid flux of the men&s;es from a pa&s;&s;ive cau&s;e, generally here attend&mdash;and when the di&s;charge is exce&s;&s;ive, or of any long continuance, pains and weakne&s;s of the loins&mdash;indige&s;tion&mdash;and other &s;ymptoms of debility&mdash;&s;wel|ling of the eye-lids&mdash;thick urine&mdash;palpitation of the heart&mdash;frequent faintings, are almo&s;t always con&s;tant concomitants;&mdash;but in the early &s;tages they do not frequently make their ap|pearance to any great degree.</P>
<P>Indeed, the colour and con&s;i&s;tence of the di&s;charge alter, from a variety of circum&s;tances, according to the nature and dura|tion of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ea&s;on, climate, and con&s;titution&mdash;in warm weather, gro&s;s habits neglecting to keep the parts clean, from quantity or acrimony painful excoriations are occa&s;ioned, in&s;o|much, that &s;ometimes it has been difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the effect of &s;ome venereal taint&mdash;and here it will be nece&s;&s;ary to advert to &s;ome concomitant circum&s;tances&mdash;if a di&s;charge comes on &s;uddenly, with &s;ymptoms of heat and pain&mdash;if it is not attended with weakne&s;s or pain in the back&mdash;if the patient appears to be of a healthful &s;trong &s;tamina&mdash;has had no chil|dren&mdash;no mi&s;carriages&mdash;nor &s;evere or copious flow of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|&s;es&mdash;if the di&s;charge &s;hould be thin and much di&s;coloured at fir&s;t, we may then &s;u&s;pect &s;omething of venereal affection in the ca&s;e&mdash;indeed, I have known many cured of what they called the whites by means to which a virulent gleet, or clap, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> readily yield.</P>
<P>However, the WHITES often occur in women who are &s;ubject to too copious a flow of the men&s;es, or have them too frequent|ly return, and are liable to this from cau&s;es which weaken the ve&s;&s;els of the womb and vagina&mdash;or are of a relaxed or debili|tated con&s;titution&mdash;hence it generally affects women advanced in life, particularly tho&s;e who have had children, have often mi&s;carried, men&s;truated irregularly&mdash;al&s;o tho&s;e who lead an in|active life; tho&s;e who are full and jolly, and whole &s;olids are
<PB N="501" REF="028021_0497_0FD673F2390DCA08">
loo&s;e and flabby&mdash;the more recent and whiter the di&s;charge, the more ea&s;y to cure the di&s;ea&s;e; the longer the continuance, and the more green or brown the colour, the more difficult.</P>
<P>CAUSES. Are all &s;uch as occa&s;ion a collection of &s;erum, and weaken the ve&s;&s;els of the parts affected, or the habit in ge|neral&mdash;hence living in moi&s;t air&mdash;feeding on vi&s;cid too food, lead|ing a life of indolence&mdash;u&s;ing too frequently warm baths; an immoderate flow, or an ob&s;truction of the men&s;es; or it may be occa&s;ioned by a tran&s;lation of humours to the womb and vagina.</P>
<P>CURE. Now it will appear obvious, as we con&s;ider the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, whether <HI>local</HI> or <HI>general,</HI> &s;o mu&s;t we adapt our remedies, whether it depends upon the relaxed &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;els of the womb primarily and principally, or we attribute it to the debilitated &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem; in the former, we may place much dependance upon external applications of the a&s;trin|gent cla&s;s; in the latter, &s;ome medicines internally &s;hould be exhibited, which will not only give &s;trength to the con&s;titution, but contribute to maintain it in that &s;tate&mdash;hence, then, accor|ding to the different circum&s;tances of the con&s;titution, we mu&s;t regulate our modes of cure.</P>
<P>When it occurs in tho&s;e who live &s;edentary and indolent lives, indulging in luxuries, and &s;upporting them&s;elves by a full rich diet, by which the habit will be loaded with gro&s;s humours, their mode &s;hould be altered to a diet which is more &s;paring, and a cooling regimen, having frequent recour&s;e to purgatives, and a more active &s;tate of life; but to tho&s;e of a more weak, relaxed &s;tate of &s;olids, we mu&s;t invigorate the con&s;titution in the &s;ame manner as directed in too copious flow of the men&s;es from a pa&s;&s;ive cau&s;e, (500.)&mdash;here it is of great u&s;e to keep the parts clean by frequent partial baths of cold water; and after gentle evacuations, in tho&s;e who have lived indolently and luxuriou&s;ly, an a&s;tringent wa&s;h of the gentle kind may be made u&s;e of, &s;uch as the re&s;tringent injection, (No. 165.) with the addition of eleven ounces of infu&s;ion of ro&s;es; in tho&s;e of relax|ed habits, injections of bark with alum, alum water, infu&s;ion of tormentil roots, with litharge water, or &s;ome &s;uch a&s;trin|gent preparations; for they are &s;aid to dimini&s;h the di&s;charge, and, in recent ca&s;es, entirely remove it.</P>
<P>Sometimes from a long continuance of this di&s;ea&s;e, the hu|mours are apt to be acrimonious and irritating, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;upporting the di&s;charge; then hart&s;horn jellies, or tho&s;e of i&s;in|gla&s;s, are agreeable and u&s;eful auxiliaries.</P>
<P>Sometimes tho&s;e &s;timulants which act upon the urinary pa&s;|&s;ages, and communicate their effects to the womb and vagina.

<P>But, in ca&s;es of long &s;tanding, I have &s;een much benefit de|rived, during the u&s;e of a&s;tringent medicines, from a &s;timulat|ing plai&s;ter or bli&s;ter applied to the region of the &s;acrum, or lower vertebrae of the back.</P>
