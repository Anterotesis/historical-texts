<P>When the unclean Spirit is gone out of the man, he walketh through dry places &s;eeking re&s;t, and findeth none.&mdash;Then he &s;aith, I will re|turn into my hou&s;e from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, &s;wept, and garni&s;hed.&mdash;Then goeth he, and taketh with him&s;elf &s;even other Spirits more wicked than him&s;elf, and they enter in, and dwell there: and the la&s;t &s;tate of that man is wor&s;e than the fir&s;t.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this chapter, we have an account of a blind and deaf Devil being ca&s;t out of a man, by our Saviour: upon which, the people were greatly amazed, and cried &mdash;is not this the &s;on of David?&mdash;The Scribes and Phari&s;ees, &s;eeing their wealth and reputation at &s;take, &s;uffered their ma|lice to ca&s;t Rea&s;on out of its &s;eat; and bold|ly
<PB N="6" REF="024115_0004_0FC3A4FF1DF34C20">
accu&s;ed Chri&s;t of ca&s;ting out Devils by Beelzebub, the Prince of the Devils. This a&s;&s;ertion, was &s;uch a palpable contradic|tion in its nature, that it needed no refut|ation. He only ob&s;erved, by way of re|proof, that as the hou&s;e, or kingdom, di|vided again&s;t it&s;elf could not &s;tand; &s;o Sa|tan, if divided, could not &s;tand.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;hort of the Spirit of God, can ca&s;t out Satan; as they acknowledged in the exorci&s;es of their &s;ons: hence &s;ays Chri&s;t, they &s;hall be your judges. But if I ca&s;t out Devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.</P>
<P>The ca&s;ting out of Devils, argued &s;upe|rior power, and divine authority. Con&s;e|quently, the imputation of that power to Beelzebub, involved them in the predica|ment of bla&s;phemy; which occa&s;ioned Chri&s;t to clo&s;e his reproof, by ob&s;erving, that who&s;oever &s;peaketh a word again&s;t the &s;on of man it &s;hall be forgiven him: but who&s;oever &s;peaketh again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, it &s;hall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of accepting this reproof, and returning to right rea&s;on, they violently ca&s;t off conviction, and demanded a &s;ign. They denied credit to the miracles he had
<PB N="7" REF="024115_0005_0FC3A50699472D18">
wrought; unle&s;s he would &s;ubmit to prove them divine, by another miracle, according to their pre&s;cription: and his refu&s;al, they made the ground, or pretence, of final re|jection.</P>
<P>This was &s;uch a flagrant act of &s;pite and malice again&s;t Chri&s;t, and his works, that he called them a generation of vipers; re|minded them of a day of judgment, and certain condemnation. And finally, in the words of our text, characteri&s;ed their vile temper of mind; their re&s;tle&s;s and fruitle&s;s &s;earch of re&s;t again&s;t light; and their mi&s;e|rable end.</P>
<P><HI>When the unclean Spirit is gone out of the man, he walketh through dry places &s;eeking re&s;t, and findeth none. Then he &s;aith, I will return into my hou&s;e from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, &s;wept, and garni&s;hed. Then goeth he, and taketh with him&s;elf &s;even other Spirits more wicked than him&s;elf, and they enter in, and dwell there: and the la&s;t &s;tate of that man is wor&s;e than the fir&s;t. Even &s;o &s;hall it be al&s;o unto this wicked generation.</HI></P>
<P>Whether we con&s;ider the&s;e words as plain and direct matter of fact, in the cavilling Scribes and Phari&s;ees; or as a mere para|ble, directly applied to them, will be of
<PB N="8" REF="024115_0006_0FC3A50815AE52D0">
no material con&s;equence. They are doubt|le&s;s a de&s;cription of the unpardonable &s;in, with the &s;everal &s;teps leading thereto, and deplorable con&s;equence: and as &s;uch, de|mand our mo&s;t &s;olemn attention.</P>
<P>My de&s;ign is, to con&s;ider the&s;e words in an explanitory manner, and then apply them:&mdash;Therefore,</P>
<P>Fir&s;tly, Let us enquire what this un|clean Spirit is, and how it goes out of the man.&mdash;Whether we con&s;ider the&s;e words as a parable, or otherwi&s;e; they mu&s;t refer to that wicked di&s;po&s;ition, with which the&s;e Scribes and Phari&s;ees went out again&s;t Chri&s;t. It is not the Devil, but the tem|per and conduct of the man, which is here condemned. That <HI>unclean Spirit,</HI> is u&s;ed here in oppo&s;ition to moral purity; to a pure and upright heart. It implies a heart wickedly and perver&s;ely &s;et again&s;t the truth.</P>
<P>In this &s;en&s;e, the Jews had accu&s;ed Chri&s;t of having an <HI>unclean Spirit</HI>; becau&s;e he ca&s;t out Devils, and condemned their tra|ditions. So again, Paul calls that &s;pirit of &s;trife and di&s;&s;ention, with which many went out again&s;t Chri&s;t, a witchcraft&mdash; Galat. 3.4. In like manner, Chri&s;t com|pares the&s;e very Scribes and Phari&s;ees,
<PB N="9" REF="024115_0007_0FC3A50997C61AF8">
to <HI>whited &s;epulchres, full of all uncleanne&s;s:</HI> becau&s;e they appeared outwardly righteous unto men; but inwardly, <HI>were full of hy|pocri&s;y and iniquity</HI>&mdash;Math. 23: 27. Thus, the <HI>unclean Spirit,</HI> is a temper of wilful re|&s;i&s;tance, and &s;tubborn perver&s;ene&s;s, again&s;t the light of evidence and good con&s;cience. And &s;uch, in fact, was the ca&s;e of the Jews: to whom the&s;e words were applied, as I &s;hall &s;hew further on.</P>
<P>Now, this unclean Spirit goes out of the man, whenever he, in words or actions, oppo&s;es Chri&s;t, the doctrines of the go&s;pel, or the influences of the Spirit of God: he then <HI>&s;cattereth abroad.</HI> Hence Chri&s;t, when he reproves the Phari&s;ees for rejecting him, and perver&s;ely adhereing to the doctrines and traditions of men, &s;ays, <HI>hear and un|der&s;tand: not that which goeth into the mouth, defileth a man: but that which cometh out of the mouth defileth a man, &s;uch as evil thoughts, adulteries, murders, thefts, covetou&s;ne&s;s, wick|edne&s;s, deceit, debate, bla&s;phemy, pride, fool|i&s;hne&s;s.</HI> And to per&s;ons of the&s;e characters, he &s;ays, <HI>ye are of your father the Devil, and his works ye will do.</HI> The&s;e are not the work of the Spirit of God, but of the fle&s;h: they proceed from an impure heart, and defiled con&s;cience: they de&s;pi&s;e Chri&s;t, and re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="024115_0008_0FC3A50B1BE03EE8">Thus, the unclean Spirit goes out of the man, when he purpo&s;ely oppo&s;es the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t: e&s;pecially &s;o, when, a|gain&s;t light, he denies the divinity of Chri&s;t, the go&s;pel revelation, and method of &s;al|vation: or, when he broaches doctrines, which render the death of Chri&s;t of non ef|fect, and the influences of the Spirit, a mere delu&s;ion; imputing the works of the Spirit of God, unto Beelzebub, the Prince of the Devils.&mdash;This leads me,</P>
<P>Secondly, To con&s;ider the effects of this going out of the Spirit, viz:&mdash;<HI>He walketh through dry places &s;eeking re&s;t, and findeth none.</HI></P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that the man, having &s;et out again&s;t Chri&s;t, and his way of &s;alva|tion, can have no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Spi|rit of God, or a revelation: but he tru&s;ts to his own beclouded rea&s;on, again&s;t infi|nite wi&s;dom. Therefore, like a man &s;eek|ing &s;u&s;tenance, in a dry and thir&s;ty de&s;ert, he will be con&s;tantly di&s;appointed. Hu|man rea&s;on, cannot obtain peace again&s;t God: there is no re&s;t, in an oppo&s;ition to the author and giver of re&s;t.</P>
<P>The conduct of the Scribes and Phari|&s;ees, to whom the&s;e words were applied, will be our be&s;t example. They, as Rulers
<PB N="11" REF="024115_0009_0FC3A50C93561A90">
and Teachers in I&s;rael, had, for a long time, acquired great e&s;teem and re&s;pect. And, by their adherence to the ceremonial law, and traditions of the fathers, which they &s;trenuou&s;ly inculcated on the people, they &s;upported their pride and enriched their pockets. Therefore, &s;o &s;oon as Chri&s;t de|clared his mi&s;&s;ion, and reproved them of &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s and neglect of the moral law, they cried out again&s;t him;&mdash;that he was a babler, a wine-bibber, impo&s;tor and friend of publicans and &s;inners. They did every thing in their power, to irritate the minds of the people, and ca&s;t contempt on Chri&s;t; well knowing, that his increa&s;e, would be their decrea&s;e: for he con&s;tantly oppo&s;ed, and openly rebuked them out of the law of God. Therefore, &s;o far as the peo|ple received Chri&s;t, &s;o far their &s;elf righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and traditional religion would fall.</P>
<P>This excited them to make a further at|tempt for re&s;t. They now denied that Chri&s;t had fulfiled the prophe&s;ies concern|ing the Me&s;&s;iah. But this deceived their hope, as defamation had done before. The people were divided. Some cried that a great Prophet had ari&s;en among them: others, that he deceived the people. In|&s;tead of re&s;t, they found confu&s;ion and di&s;appointment. And in addition to their
<PB N="12" REF="024115_0010_0FC3A50E848326C0">
anxiety, Chri&s;t produced infallible evi|dence of his divine mi&s;&s;ion. He wrought miracles publicly, tending to the glory of God, and good of man: and <HI>the&s;e,</HI> unat|tended with art and juggling. By a word, he re&s;tored a withered hand: by a voice, he rai&s;ed the dead: and by authoritive command, he ca&s;t out a blind and dumb Devil. At this the people were amazed, and &s;aid&mdash;<HI>is not this the &s;on of David?</HI> They acknowledged him the Me&s;&s;iah, the &s;eed of David, prophe&s;ied of.</P>
<P>The Scribes and Phari&s;ees were now more offended than ever: ye &s;ee, &s;aid they, how we gain nothing, the world has gone out after him. Their religion, riches and honor, were at &s;take; and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily give place to the reception given to Chri&s;t. Therefore, although they acknowledged the power of God, in ca&s;ting out Devils, by their &s;ons; yet they di&s;allowed it in Chri&s;t; and aro&s;e as one man, and came forward among the people, crying&mdash;<HI>This fellow doth not ca&s;t out Devils, but by Beel|zebub the Prince of the Devils.</HI></P>
<P>Here they &s;eek re&s;t, but find none. This is &s;uch a bare-faced piece of &s;pite and ma|lice, that Chri&s;t calls them a generation of vipers. Rea&s;on, was ca&s;t off her &s;eat: and they were conedmned out of their own
<PB N="13" REF="024115_0011_0FC3A514CA55CC38">
mouths. <HI>If an hou&s;e or kingdom be divided again&s;t it&s;elf, how can it &s;tand? If Satan be divided, how &s;hall his kingdom &s;tand?</HI>&mdash;They fir&s;t, denied the operations of the Spirit of God; and then a&s;&s;erted impo&s;&s;ibilities to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>This drove them into another barren place for re&s;t; they next, carved out for God: <HI>Ma&s;ter, we would &s;ee a &s;ign from thee.</HI> They required him to work another mira|cle, by their pre&s;cription, to prove tho&s;e divine. He po&s;itively denied them. For, if they would not believe in miracles, wrought in God's way, neither would they, if wrought in their own way. And the dignity of the divine perfections, forbid the working of miracles at human direction; or, for the gratification of caviling and ma|licious &s;pirits. This left them, &s;eeking re&s;t and finding none. Thus, our text ap|pears to be direct matter of fact; as ap|plied to the &s;piteful temper, and malicious conduct of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees.</P>
<P>And indeed, this is the ca&s;e with all men, who go out again&s;t Chri&s;t, and his go&s;pel: they are like a troubled &s;ea, never at re&s;t. The light of rea&s;on and con&s;cience, conti|nually di&s;turb their re&s;ting places: they fear their own rea&s;oning; but are too wil|ful to attend to the checks of con&s;cience,
<PB N="14" REF="024115_0012_0FC3A51984ACB760">
and the evidence of revelation. Hence, they are always bu&s;y after re&s;t; but to no good purpo&s;e; except, to greater conviction and more di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;tate of tho&s;e, who deny the being of a God: <HI>for the invi&s;ible things of God are clearly under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead</HI>; &s;o that the very heathen are without ex|cu&s;e, for not glorifying him as God. Here the athei&s;t &s;eeks re&s;t again&s;t the works of creation and Providence, and con&s;equent|ly, in dry places.</P>
<P>The dei&s;t al&s;o, who denies the divinity of Chri&s;t, and of his go&s;pel, mu&s;t oppo&s;e &s;ound rea&s;on and con&s;cience; mu&s;t run again&s;t the fulfilment of the prophe&s;ies, and miracles, wrought evidently by the power of God; and the&s;e, atte&s;ted by the enemies of Chri&s;t, and &s;ealed by the blood of his friends.</P>
<P>This cla&s;s of re&s;t-&s;eekers, ari&s;e out of loo&s;e and profane characters; who, to ob|tain re&s;t again&s;t con&s;cience, make partial interpretation of &s;cripture; and con&s;e|quently partial denial of God's word. But certainly they may as well deny the whole, as a part. The ab&s;urdity of a partial de|nial, is &s;o obvious, that they &s;oon ca&s;t off
<PB N="15" REF="024115_0013_0FC3A51ADA0B3898">
fear, deny, the whole, and commence dei&s;ts in full.</P>
<P>Human rea&s;on, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by revelation or the influences of the Spirit of God, is now their only guide. <HI>That rea&s;on,</HI> which at be&s;t, can only convince us that we have lo&s;t the rectitude of our nature, are under the di&s;plea&s;ure of God, and unable of our|&s;elves to return to our duty: <HI>that rea&s;on,</HI> which is but an imperfect guide in any of our worldly concerns: I &s;ay, <HI>that rea&s;on</HI> is all they can bring again&s;t infinite wi&s;dom, and tho&s;e evidences, which have obliged them to retreat &s;tep by &s;tep into the barren fields of carnal wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>They can now, only carve out for God. Carnal rea&s;on &s;ays, the &s;cripture, with all the fulfilment of prophe&s;ies, miracles wrought, and atte&s;ted by credible hi&s;tory, is no &s;ufficient evidence of the divinity of Chri&s;t. Therefore (like the Jews in the &s;ame ca&s;e of incon&s;i&s;tency) they &s;ay, <HI>Ma&s;ter, we would &s;ee a &s;ign from thee.</HI> They deny credit to the go&s;pel; unle&s;s God will con|de&s;cend to prove tho&s;e prophe&s;ies and mi|racles, true; and tho&s;e witne&s;&s;es, who &s;eal-the truth with their blood, true witne&s;&s;es, according to their pre&s;cribing. But it is ob&s;ervable, that &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ion is be|low the dignity of God. <HI>No &s;ign &s;hall be
<PB N="16" REF="024115_0014_0FC3A51C5A610188">
given,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t. Tho&s;e given were &s;uf|ficient: if they receive not tho&s;e given in God's way, neither would they though gi|ven in their own way. <HI>If they believe not Mo&s;es and the prophets, neither would they be|lieve, though one aro&s;e from the dead.</HI></P>
<P>Such per&s;ons are in the mo&s;t alarming &s;ituation: they &s;tand upon the brink of hell: one &s;tep further in this way after re&s;t, will be irrecoverable. If they (like the Jews) make God's refu&s;al to gratify their cavilling, the ground of re&s;olute and continued rejection, of the go&s;pel evidence; they may probably remain here, until the great day of account. Such grounded re|jection, effectually bars the door again&s;t any further conviction; and con&s;equently, damnation mu&s;t follow.</P>
<P>To this, doubtle&s;s, Chri&s;t had a parti|cular reference in the words before us. It was the preci&s;e ca&s;e of the Scribes and Pha|ri&s;ees, to whom they were &s;poken. And we have rea&s;on to fear, it is the ca&s;e of ma|ny of this day; who are going out again&s;t Chri&s;t, in the boa&s;t of their own rea&s;on: they walk through dry places, &s;eeking re&s;t and finding none.</P>
<P>And indeed, it is ob&s;ervable, that &s;uch is the ca&s;e of every per&s;on in &s;ome degree,
<PB N="17" REF="024115_0015_0FC3A51DCEAFF6C8">
while under &s;piritual illumination and conviction. The carnal mind and Satan, will ca&s;t every po&s;&s;ible objection, in the way of believing: hence, various turnings after a quiet con&s;cience; but no &s;eeking re&s;t, again&s;t light of evidence and con&s;ci|ence, can give peace in the way or &s;alva|tion in the end.</P>
<P>Hence we &s;ee, that a man may go far again&s;t Chri&s;t, with an unclean &s;pirit: and yet find no re&s;t to his &s;oul.&mdash;This leads us to con&s;ider the effect of this fruitle&s;s &s;earch, or the nature of the man's re&s;olve, viz:</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>I will return into my hou&s;e from whence I came out.</HI></P>
<P>Here we note, that all who walk through dry places &s;eeking re&s;t, do not come to this la&s;t re&s;olve. Many, who have been under great &s;piritual alarms, and re&s;i&s;ted for a long time, have finally &s;een their error, repented, and received the truth in the love of it.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t is here &s;hewing the &s;tate of the infidel Jews, who rejected him wilfully, again&s;t clear light and &s;trong evidence. We mu&s;t therefore con&s;ider the man as coming to this la&s;t de&s;perate re&s;olve; <HI>I will return to my hou&s;e, from whence I came out.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="024115_0016_0FC3A51F6CD6E5A8">Two things are here worthy of con&s;ider|ation, viz. The nature of this re&s;olve, and the matter or end re&s;olved upon.</P>
<P>With regard to the nature of this re|&s;olve, it is ob&s;ervable, that it is a fixed and &s;ettled determination, without any provi&s;o, limitation or condition. He does not pro|po&s;e to wait longer, or &s;eek further; he does not de&s;ire more light; but is &s;atisfied: and his re&s;olve is emphatically deci&s;ive&mdash;<HI>I will return.</HI> I will &s;eek no further: I will weary my&s;elf no more in this perplexing &s;earch after re&s;t: it is all a delu&s;ion, the work of an unclean &s;pirit&mdash;<HI>By Beelzebub he ca&s;teth out devils.</HI> The re&s;olve is wilful and ob&s;tinate: he acts not the part of a wi&s;e man, who embraces the truth, becau&s;e the evidence is too &s;trong for him: but finding light and evidence too &s;trong, he re&s;olves to fly from it: his works are works of darkne&s;s, and will not bear the light. He knowingly and wilfully flies from his con|viction; rejects the fulfilment of prophe|&s;ies; denies miracles wrought by the Spirit of God: and <HI>the&s;e,</HI> acknowledged fact, by the enemies of the go&s;pel; and &s;ealed by the blood of its friends. Thus the Jews, tho' they could not deny fact; yet wilfully ca&s;t off their convictions, and demanded a &s;ign, hoping to pacify their own con&s;cien|ces,
<PB N="19" REF="024115_0017_0FC3A520F7BA8678">
and blind the eyes of the people. Hence Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>ye &s;erpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye e&s;cape the damnation of Hell.</HI></P>
<P>This wilful re&s;olve effectually bars the door again&s;t any further operations of the Spirit of God. The man dies in ob&s;tinacy: not for want of mercy in God, or merit in Chri&s;t: but by denying the Spirit of God, he &s;huts the door again&s;t any reception of a &s;pirit of conviction. And God has &s;aid, that &s;uch de&s;pite towards the Spirit of his grace; <HI>&s;hall not be forgiven, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</HI></P>
<P>This re&s;olve is no ra&s;h, incon&s;iderate act, without time to reflect; but it is after go|ing thro' dry places, &s;eeking re&s;t and find|ing none: after repeated warnings and in|vitations; and after &s;ufficient and rea&s;on|able evidence of the truth. Therefore, the re&s;olve is wilful and deliberate, mature and deci&s;ive, again&s;t the light of con&s;cience, re|velation, and the influences of the Spirit.</P>
<P>The matter re&s;olved on is, that he will go back, <HI>into his hou&s;e from whence he came out.</HI></P>
<P>In order to know what this hou&s;e is, we mu&s;t enquire from whence the man &s;et out, viz. from a &s;tate of a carnal re&s;t and &s;ecu|rity.

A man before conviction, feels very ea&s;y and &s;ecure: this is the &s;tate, or hou&s;e, of every unawakened &s;inner; for Satan takes care to keep it unmole&s;ted, until drove out by the power of God. Hence our Saviour &s;ays, <HI>when a &s;trong man, armed, keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace. But when a &s;tronger than he &s;hall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he tru&s;ted, and divideth his &s;poils.</HI> The man is at re&s;t, while under the darkne&s;s of the carnal heart, and Sa|tan's influences: but when Chri&s;t comes upon him, being the &s;tronger man, his peace is de&s;troyed. And he goes out again&s;t Chri&s;t, with a carnal mind, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Sa|tan; which makes it an unclean &s;pirit, walking through dry places, &s;eeking re&s;t and finding none. And at length, rather than &s;ubmit to the light of evidence, and conviction of con&s;cience, he violently and wilfully ca&s;ts off all re&s;traint, and returns like the dog to his vomit: He goes back to his hou&s;e, or &s;tate of carnal re&s;t, from whence he came out.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, all this alarm and fear is con|trary to rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e: a piece of prie&s;t-craft to blind mankind: a mere enthu&s;ia&s;m, and delu&s;ion of the Devil. All the influences of the &s;pirit of God, he
<PB N="21" REF="024115_0019_0FC3A52911BCF848">
imputes to Beelzebub, the Prince of De|vils: and embraces his influences and dic|tates, as congenial to his own perver&s;e rea|&s;on and carnal heart. He is determined, no longer to be a &s;lave to this unea&s;y mind: therefore, violently &s;huts his eyes, again&s;t the evidence of the go&s;pel, and influences of the &s;pirit of God. Thus, the man falls a&s;leep in &s;piritual death: the way is no longer open to conviction: he can have nothing of a &s;piritual nature to di&s;turb his con&s;cience; and God forbids us even to pray for him. The Devil &s;miles; his palace and his goods are again in peace: and for his own &s;ake, he will take care that all things are agreeable to the man's &s;tate of carnal &s;ecurity, for the better deluding others into this &s;tate of final and irrecover|able ruin.&mdash;This leads,</P>
<P>Fourthly, To con&s;ider the preparations made in this hou&s;e, for the return of this unclean &s;pirit:&mdash;<HI>And when he is come, he findeth it empty, &s;wept, and garni&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>This heart, or hou&s;e of carnal re&s;t, he finds <HI>empty:</HI> it has been left for a &s;ea&s;on, while he has been wandering through dry places, &s;eeking re&s;t and finding none. Chri&s;t, by his Spirit, had di&s;turbed the &s;trong man's palace: his goods had been greatly di&s;comforted; the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="024115_0020_0FC3A52AA19B0700">
always makes the carnal heart, the devil's kingdom, fear and tremble. Hence he went out again&s;t Chri&s;t with pride and ma|lice; and &s;pitefully re&s;olved again&s;t him.</P>
<P>But this &s;tate or hou&s;e is now emphati|cally <HI>empty</HI> of the Spirit of God. The man imputes all the influences and &s;trivings of the holy Spirit, unto Beelzebub; and thus &s;huts the door again&s;t him&s;elf: there is no room left for further conviction. That this hou&s;e becomes empty of the means of grace, as &s;uch: they operate on him direct|ly the rever&s;e; they drive him further from God. Thus the hou&s;e is empty of all good; ju&s;t fit for him&s;elf, or a bla&s;phemer of the Holy Gho&s;t, and determined &s;ervant of Satan.</P>
<P>This hou&s;e is al&s;o <HI>&s;wept.</HI> This implies, a total ab&s;ence of all &s;piritual things; they are as &s;wept out; there are no remains of the Spirit's operations; but his con&s;cience is as &s;cared with an hot iron. It cannot feel the power of &s;piritual things; he ac|counts them as dro&s;s and dung; as delu|&s;ion, and enthu&s;ia&s;m of the Devil. He has no feelings or conceptions of &s;piritual things: but God has &s;aid of him, he is joined unto idols, let him alone. Thus he not only denies the Holy Gho&s;t; but God leaves him to the delu&s;ion of his own heart, and his gods.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="024115_0021_0FC3A52CE9AC51D8">Again, This hou&s;e is not only <HI>empty</HI> and <HI>&s;wept</HI>; but <HI>garni&s;hed.</HI> It is made a place of delight: not merely empty of di&s;agree|able objects; but adorned with many things, which give plea&s;urable entertain|ment. Altho' it is mo&s;t certain, that Sa|tan can give no &s;piritual joy, or any appro|bation of <HI>con&s;cience:</HI> yet he can do much to &s;tupify it. He blinds the mind; paints &s;in in gay colours; and adds delight to &s;en&s;ual gratifications. Hence, the man feels no pain, from bitter reflexions on the turpitude of his heart and life. The Devil &s;miles; the man is plea&s;ed; and carnal plea&s;ures circulate in one continued round of painted vice and diabolical rage; until he awakes to new &s;en&s;ations before the throne of God.&mdash;Or, in the &s;tyle of our text; as men, when they &s;et out on family life, take care to have a dwelling fitted to their circum&s;tances; that it is clean, paint|ed and adorned, for an agreeable reception: &s;o this man, by his own act, finds this hou&s;e empty and &s;wept of all good; and Satan, his &s;piritual hu&s;band, has garni&s;hed it with diabolic plea&s;ure, for his reception. &mdash;This leads us,</P>
<P>Fifthly, To con&s;ider the man's conduct, in taking a renewed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>He taketh with him&s;elf, &s;even other &s;pirits

more wicked than him&s;elf, and they enter in, and dwell there.</HI></P>
<P>This man does not return alone: he is not content to live in &s;olitary mood; but &s;eeks company. He has long been re&s;train|ed, by notions of prie&s;t-craft, and religious whims (as he terms them) but now, hav|ing come to his rea&s;on again, is determined to make up for lo&s;t time.</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t univer&s;ally true, that per|&s;ons, who have had great illumination and &s;trong convictions; when they lo&s;e the&s;e convictions, prove much more loo&s;e and profane, than before. But the man who maliciou&s;ly denies the Spirit of God, and wilfully returns to his former &s;tate of &s;in and &s;ecurity; has no re&s;traint of con&s;ci|ence left: but &s;purred on by Satan, he gives full loo&s;e to all his carnal appetites. Natural fear and ambition are all that con|troul his con&s;cience, from acting out the &s;pite and malice of devils, according to his ability.</P>
<P>Hence, he is &s;aid to take &s;even other &s;pi|rits more wicked than him&s;elf. It is ob|&s;ervable, that &s;even is u&s;ed in &s;cripture often, as a certain number for an uncer|tain; thus &s;even devils are &s;aid to be ca&s;t out of Mary Magdalene. It is al&s;o u&s;ed,

as a number of perfection: thus, we read of &s;even candle&s;ticks, &s;even viols&mdash;trum|pets&mdash;&s;eals, plagues, &amp;c. Thus his taking &s;even other &s;pirits, implies, that he is to|tally left of God's Spirit; given up to the dominion of devils; and the lu&s;ts of his own hard heart. He is now a fit object for the Devil to vent his malice upon, a|gain&s;t Chri&s;t: and certainly, he will &s;pare no pains, to rai&s;e his triumph again&s;t the Redeemer's kingdom. The man is plea&s;ed with the &s;ervice, and never more delighted than when railing and &s;coffing at religion. Thus we find tho&s;e, who have apo&s;tati&s;ed from the Cri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, always harp|ing on the incon&s;i&s;tency and unrea&s;onable|ne&s;s of the Chri&s;tian religion: &s;coffing at the convictions of the Spirit, and terrors of con&s;cience, as mere enthu&s;ia&s;m and de|lu&s;ion: boa&s;ting of their own knowledge, and high attainments of living according to rea&s;on: con&s;equently endeavouring to lead others into the like cour&s;es; and thus running merrily down the broad way of perdition.</P>
<P>The man, being thus given up to his own lu&s;ts, and the influences of Satan, is &s;aid to <HI>take other &s;pirits more wicked than him&s;elf.</HI> They are exceedingly different from his feelings and endeavors before, and

while under the awakenings of the Spirit of God. He has now no &s;piritual re&s;traint; but every evil pa&s;&s;ion reigns uncontrouled. Like a bow doubly &s;trained, he &s;prings back with double force. Having been re&s;train|ed by conviction, and obliged to &s;eek re&s;t in dry places, he returns, determined to make up lo&s;t time. His &s;oul is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with devils and lu&s;ts: his heart is hell in the beginning; pre&s;&s;ing fa&s;t on to perfec|tion of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;pirits are &s;aid to <HI>enter in, and dwell there.</HI>&mdash;Before his wilful apo&s;tacy, they were not &s;ettled and immovable, but were often di&s;turbed by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t: but now they are &s;ettled and fixed in the heart: not for a month, or year; but for <HI>eternity.</HI> The man is left a prey to his lu&s;ts. He has done de&s;pite to the Spirit of all grace: and God &s;ays (concerning him) <HI>there remaineth no more &s;acrifice for &s;ins.</HI></P>
<P>I now pa&s;s to the la&s;t divi&s;ion of the words, viz.</P>
<P>Sixthly, <HI>And the la&s;t &s;tate of that man is wor&s;e than the fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>This is evident at fir&s;t blu&s;h: he is now unalterably fixed in a &s;tate of &s;in and &s;ecu|rity. At fir&s;t, he was not ab&s;olutely de|termined again&s;t Chri&s;t, and his &s;alvation;

That he has had his day of grace, even as others, and might have accepted: but his proud heart would not bow to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t. He valued his blind rea&s;on, more than a divine re|velation, and conviction of con&s;cience. He violently &s;hut his eyes again&s;t the light: and with &s;pite, rejected the Holy Gho&s;t; imputing his influences to Beelzebub, the Prince of Devils. He hated God, and the works of his Spirit: and therefore rejected them and went back to his hou&s;e from whence he came out: and finally, with other Spirits, has joined again&s;t God, and his method of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Thus, he has &s;inned with his eyes open, and has no cloak for his &s;in. Pride, infi|delity and malice, are deep rooted in his heart, and prevent any further convictions: the heart is bared by a wilful ob&s;tinacy. The Spirit, by which alone God works effi|caciou&s;ly on the heart, he contemptuou&s;ly calls Beelzebub: con&s;equently, the Holy Gho&s;t can operate on him in no character but of the Devil: and as &s;uch, mu&s;t drive him further off from God; and plunge him deeper into the gulph of hell.

Hence the man cannot be brought home to God on the go&s;pel plan; con&s;equently, in no way at all: there is no way open for &s;aving conviction.</P>
<P>Moreover, this &s;in of wilful and mali|cious rejection of the Spirit, is of &s;uch heinous nature, that God has declared, <HI>it &s;hall not be forgiven neither in this world, nei|ther in the world to come.</HI> Thus, in whatever point of light we view this la&s;t &s;tate of the man, we find it wor&s;e than the fir&s;t.</P>

awakenings and convictions of the Spi|rit, they are in continual &s;earch of re&s;t. At &s;uch time, there is no peace in the &s;oul: the &s;trong man is di&s;turbed by the man who is &s;tronger than he. Awakened &s;in|ners labour under a deep &s;en&s;e of guilt, and direful apprehen&s;ions of puni&s;hment: to which we add, that the Devil will by no means be idle on &s;uch occa&s;ions: his king|dom is invaded.

<P>This fruitle&s;s &s;earch for happine&s;s out of Chri&s;t, has very different effects on the human heart.</P>

as diabolic; wilfully return to their hou&s;e, like the dog to his vomet; and run &s;even fold fa&s;ter, in the way of perdition, than heretofore. The&s;e are eter|nally lo&s;t, as we have ju&s;t &s;hewn.</P>
<P>Others, &s;eeking re&s;t and finding none, grow melancholy, and fall into a kind of mopi&s;h de&s;pondency: they tea&s;e them&s;elves and di&s;honor God. They expected to have found peace long ago; but are con|&s;tantly deceived: their &s;tate grows darker and darker: God will not regard them: He is a hard ma&s;ter: and they cannot &s;ee, that it an&s;wers any purpo&s;e to &s;erve him.

<P>The&s;e are proud beggars, who &s;erve God merely for hire; and not receiving wages, they leave off work; accu&s;e God of par|tiality, and backwardne&s;s to pardon.

or el&s;e, through a too confident di&s;|po&s;ition, think they have obtained pardon, when they have not.

<P>This dethrones con&s;cience, and denies Chri&s;t. It is a fearful &s;tep towards, and near approach to, that &s;in which cannot be for|given; yet much indulged in the pre&s;ent degenerate age. Some openly deny a di|vine revelation; and many others do it implicitly: &s;etting up human rea&s;on a|gain&s;t infinite wi&s;dom. They will not ad|mit a revelation from God; becau&s;e they cannot comprehend it: which, if they could, would be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to di&s;|believe it. But &s;uch is the pride and cor|ruption of the human heart, that all reli|gion mu&s;t be brought up to their &s;tandard. Not feeling them&s;elves totally depraved, they infer, that man may &s;ave him&s;elf: or at lea&s;t, do that good which will obligate God to &s;ave him.</P>

<P>However unnoticed, this conduct is cer|tainly highly criminal: and, though gilded with the name of <HI>rational,</HI> that rea&s;on mu&s;t be exceedingly perver&s;e, which is &s;ubject to the human will, and repugnant to the God of rea&s;on.

Let them but decidedly re&s;olve to follow this rea&s;on, in oppo&s;ition to the light of revelation, and an awakened con|&s;cience; then, the nature of things, and a divine revelation determine them eternally lo&s;t So that it appears exceedingly danger|ous to &s;et up our wills, in oppo&s;ition to the light of con&s;cience and revelation, and force our rea&s;on again&s;t infinite wi&s;dom.</P>
<P N="3">3. We learn the peculiar nature of that &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, which cannot be forgiven.</P>

&s;inning and &s;uch apo&s;tati&s;ing are exceed|ingly heinous in the &s;ight of God; and if per&s;i&s;ted in, without repentance, will bring final death. Yet, in their nature, they may be pardonable.</P>
<P>But this &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, which is unto death, is of a peculiar colour: it is of the blacke&s;t die: It is a &s;in of know|ledge, again&s;t great light, repeated warn|ings, and &s;trong evidence. It is a wilful, deliberate contempt of the holy Spirit: a perver&s;e denial of his operations, and ma|licious imputation of them unto infernal &s;pirits. <HI>By Beelzebub the Prince of the De|vils, he ca&s;teth out Devils,</HI> &s;aid the Scribes.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t effectually bars the door a|gain&s;t any further conviction; for the &s;pi|rit can operate on the man, in no charac|ter but of the Devil; con&s;equently, he lives at ea&s;e and &s;ecurity in &s;in. Yet, though he finds his hou&s;e empty, &s;wept and garni&s;h|ed, his la&s;t end is wor&s;e than the fir&s;t.

<P>The miracles of Chri&s;t, together with his la&s;t &s;ign to the Jews, the &s;ign of the prophet Jonas, are atte&s;ted by the enemies of the cro&s;s, and &s;ealed by the blood of its friends. It is ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e the enemies &s;hould acknowledge, or the friends lay down their lives in proof of what they knew to be a fal&s;ehood. That, allowing men common &s;en&s;e and common hone&s;ty, the facts are true beyond rea&s;onable doubt.</P>
<P>In addition to this, every one of us, who have arrived to years of di&s;cretion, have felt the Spirit of God, witne&s;&s;ing on our hearts the truth of the go&s;pel revelation. But how have we conducted under this light and knowledge? have we not &s;hut our eyes, &s;topped our ears, and hardened our hearts, le&s;t we &s;hould &s;ee, under&s;tand, and be con|verted? have we not con&s;idered the &s;ervice
<PB N="37" REF="024115_0035_0FC3A55AB1CD5420">
of God as burden&s;ome; of but little or no importance; a mere piece of policy and prie&s;t-craft? Have we not con&s;idered &s;ea|&s;ons of &s;piritual awakenings, as enthu&s;ia&s;m and delu&s;ion, detrimental to the honor, plea&s;ures, and intere&s;t of mankind? And have we not gone out again&s;t tho&s;e con|victions, with an unclean &s;pirit, de&s;igning to make them appear ab&s;urd and redicu|lous; and &s;trove, by fal&s;e argumentation, to &s;et a&s;ide the go&s;pel method of &s;alvation? And though we have walked through dry places, &s;eeking re&s;t and finding none; yet, have we not perver&s;ely followed our &s;earch, again&s;t light and rea&s;on, rather than em|brace the truth?&mdash;But admitting that we have received the &s;pirit of conviction; how often have we grieved him to depart: how often &s;trove to ca&s;t off convictions, and lull con&s;cience a&s;leep, by going to our cups, our beds, our work or diver&s;ion?&mdash;And while we have pretended to cheri&s;h our convictions, did not our dulne&s;s and inattention, give rea|&s;on for &s;elf-condemnation? When God has continued us under long awakenings, and delayed to an&s;wer our reque&s;ts; have we not felt heart-ri&s;ings again&s;t him; been fretful, and &s;et down in the &s;piritual de&s;ert, neglect|ing the means of knowing God, our&s;elves and our duty?&mdash;And at other times, have we not been proud of our &s;piritual attainments, and imagined that we have obtained the
<PB N="38" REF="024115_0036_0FC3A55C25E56E68">
peace of God; when we had not &s;o &s;een our own hearts, as to mourn for the deceitful|ne&s;s and wickedne&s;s thereof?</P>
<P>The&s;e things call for &s;peedy and &s;erious attention. All oppo&s;ition to, or neglect of the Spirit, is an high provocation to God; and very dangerous to our &s;ouls. They who refu&s;e to be brought home to God, in his way, will never come in any; but mu&s;t die without mercy.</P>
<P>Let us then carefully examine our hearts, reform our lives, and bring forth fruit un|to God. Let us receive the &s;pirit of con|viction, with humbling and &s;elf-aba&s;ing thoughts; and high and admiring thoughts of the divine love and goodne&s;s. Let us be patient under the hand of God; wait his time, and in his way, for a ble&s;&s;ing: knowing, that if ever we receive, or what|ever good we may receive, it is of grace; and ought to be received with thank&s;giving.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let all who are &s;eeking re&s;t, and find|ing none, under their convictions imme|diately embrace offered mercy.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to find an approving con|&s;cience out of Chri&s;t: it is &s;eeking in dry and barren places. The evidences of the &s;pirit, and go&s;pel truth, cannot be de&s;troy|ed by carnal argumentation: the awaken|ed con&s;cience will never find re&s;t from car|nal rea&s;oning. How full of madne&s;s, then, to procra&s;tinate, while Chri&s;t is knocking
<PB N="39" REF="024115_0037_0FC3A55D900D3120">
at the door of our hearts? It de&s;troys peace in this life, and ri&s;ks eternal happine&s;s in the next. Now is the accepted time, now is the day of &s;alvation, while the &s;pirit is &s;triving: but the morrow may be too late. Death may intervene; &s;in may &s;hut the door of grace; or God may &s;ay, <HI>He is join|ed unto idols let him alone.</HI></P>
<P>The longer we put off, &s;o much more is God offended, &s;o much more is Chri&s;t &s;light|ed, and &s;o much more the Holy Gho&s;t is grieved. We al&s;o grow more wilful, more &s;tubborn, and more perver&s;e; con&s;equent|ly, more likely to fall away irrecoverably. Let us then awake to a &s;en&s;e of our danger, and of our duty: cea&s;e to oppo&s;e God and his &s;alvation. Let us no more walk thro' the barren fields of beclouded rea&s;on after re&s;t: but let us con&s;ider our convictions as the work of God; and humbly accept of offered mercy; fervently praying God, that our convictions may be effectual to &s;aving conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>But if any of you are re&s;olved to go on in the way of your own hearts, and in the &s;ight of your own eyes, adding &s;in to &s;in; to make your brows as bra&s;s, and your hearts as adamant; to &s;tifle all conviction, and go back to your hou&s;e of carnal re&s;t; then, go on&mdash;take your own way. But be a&s;&s;ured, <HI>that the day of the Lord is at hand, and as a de&s;truction from the Almighty &s;hall
<PB N="40" REF="024115_0038_0FC3A55F6819DA98">
it come: He will whet his glittering &s;word, and his hand &s;hall take hold on judgment: He will render vengeance to his enemies, and re|ward them that hate him: He will make his arrows drunk with blood; with the blood of the &s;lain, from the beginning of revenge upon the enemy</HI> Then &s;hall the brazen brow be broke; and the adamantine heart will bur&s;t into ten thou&s;and pieces: &s;tifled convictions will have a fearful re&s;urrection, as &s;o ma|ny arrows of death, to torment the &s;oul throughout the endle&s;s ages of eternity.</P>
<P>Awake then, oh procra&s;tinating &s;inner, awake! Be wi&s;e, and con&s;ider your latter end. Improve the pre&s;ent moments, and accept of offered mercy. Drop all your &s;ins, your &s;orrows, your fears and doubts at the foot-&s;tool of the cro&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Ari&s;e with him to newne&s;s of life, and bring forth fruit unto God. Then the riches of God's grace will be glorified in your par|don and &s;alvation: you will be accepted in Chri&s;t the beloved, and admitted into the &s;ociety of the church of the fir&s;t born of God in Heaven, to rai&s;e the trophies, and &s;ing the triumphs of redeeming love.&mdash; Which, may God grant for the &s;ake of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, our a&s;cended Lord, and Re|deemer.&mdash;AMEN.</P>
