<P>IT gives me great Plea&s;ure to &s;ee &s;o many of you, and of &s;o many different Nations, at this Council Fire. I bid you heartily Welcome.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this String I wipe the Sweat and Du&s;t out of your Eyes, that you may &s;ee your Bre|threns Faces, and look chearful. With this String I take all Bitterne&s;s out of your Brea&s;t, as well as every Thing di&s;agreeable that may have gathered there, in order that you may &s;peak perfectly free and open to us. With this String I gather the Blood, and take it away from the Council Seats, that your Clothes may not be &s;tained, nor your Minds any Ways di&s;turbed.</P>
<P><HI>Three Strings.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> interpreted the Sub&s;tance of this Speech, and &s;aying his Memory did not &s;erve him to remember the &s;everal Ceremonies in U&s;e on this Occa&s;ion, he de&s;ired <HI>Nichas,</HI> a <HI>Mo|hawk</HI> Chief, to do it for him, which he did, and it was afterwards interpreted by Captain <HI>Henry Montour,</HI> in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and the <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>
<P>After a &s;hort Pau&s;e, <HI>Taga&s;hata,</HI> the <HI>Seneca</HI> Chief, ro&s;e up, and repeating, as u&s;ual, each Paragraph di&s;tincty as &s;poke by the Governor, he returned Thanks, and went through the &s;ame Ceremonies to the Governor, Council, and People of the Province, adding on the la&s;t String, that their Great Grandfathers had told them, that they had made a Road for them to travel to their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and that whenever it &s;hould be &s;topped, they would be|come a poor People.

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Here is another Belt, by which we were invited lately to come to a Council Fire, that was kindled in an I&s;land near the Sea: This &s;urprized us, as we never heard of a Council Fire in an I&s;land.

<P>The Governor replied, that he would enquire for the Belts &s;ent by them, and they &s;hould be returned.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am glad to &s;ee &s;o many of you met together, to cultivate Peace with your Brethren and old Friends the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I heartily bid you welcome; and wi&s;h that the good Work for which you are now a&s;&s;embled, may pro&s;per in your Hands, and have that Succe&s;s, which your wi&s;e Men, and all that wi&s;h you well, mu&s;t de&s;ire, as a Thing much to your Advantage.</P>
<P>The Situation of the Province over which I pre&s;ide, and the Di&s;po&s;ition of its People, have hitherto afforded very little Occa&s;ion for Treaties with the neighbouring <HI>Indians</HI>; but having, &s;ome Months ago, &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> I received a Me&s;&s;age from our Brethren the <HI>Senecas,</HI> and <HI>Cayugas,</HI> wherein they take upon them to an&s;wer my Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> and de&s;ire that I would meet them at the Council Fire burning at this Place.</P>
<P>It is not u&s;ual for the King's Governors to go out of their Provinces to attend Treaties; but I am glad to have an Opportunity of &s;hewing my good Di&s;po&s;ition to e&s;tabli&s;h Peace and Friend&s;hip with my Neighbours; and therefore I have waved all Forms, and am come here, according to the Invitation I received at <HI>Burlington.</HI></P>
<P>To you therefore, our Brethren the <HI>Senecas</HI> and <HI>Cayugas,</HI> and your Nephews the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> I now &s;peak, and de&s;ire that you would take into your mo&s;t &s;erions Con&s;ideration, my Me&s;;|&s;age to the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> your Me&s;&s;age to me, and my An&s;wer thereto, and let me know what we are to expect from you.</P>
<P>What is pa&s;t, we are willing to forget; but I mu&s;t remind you, that if you are di&s;po&s;ed to be our Friends for the future, you &s;hould give us that Proof of your Sincerity which I have de&s;ired in my An&s;wer to your Me&s;&s;age, and return us the Captives that have been tak|en out of our Province, and are now within your Power; this &s;hould be one of the fir&s;t Steps, and will be the be&s;t that can be taken, towards re&s;toring and confirming that Brotherly Love and Friend&s;hip between us, which I am convinced will be for the mutual Benefit of all Parties.</P>
<P>This was interpreted in the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Language by Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er,</HI> and in the <HI>Delaware</HI> by Mr. <HI>Stephen Calvin,</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> Schoolma&s;ter in <HI>We&s;t-Jer&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Teedyu&s;cung <HI>&s;poke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I de&s;ire all of you who are pre&s;ent, will give Ear to me. As you, my Brethren, de|&s;ired me to call all the Nations who live back, I have done &s;o; I have given the Halloo, and &s;uch as have heard me are pre&s;ent. Now, if you have any Thing to &s;ay to them, or they to you, you mu&s;t &s;it and talk together.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I &s;it by, only to hear and &s;ee what you &s;ay to one another; for I have &s;aid what I have to &s;ay to the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> who &s;its here; he knows what has pa&s;&s;ed between us. I have made known to him the Rea&s;on why I &s;truck him. Now I and the Governor have made up the&s;e Differences between him and me, and I think we have done it, as far as we can, for our future Peace.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>The above Speech was interpreted in the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Language.</P>
<P>Taga&s;hata <HI>then ro&s;e up and &s;poke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren the Governors, and your Councils,</HI></P>
<P>It has plea&s;ed the mo&s;t High that we meet together here with chearful Countenances, and a good deal of Satisfaction; and as publick Bu&s;ine&s;s requires grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Con&s;ideration, and the Day is almo&s;t &s;pent, I chu&s;e to &s;peak early To-morrow Morning.</P>

<P>We now remove the Hatchet out of your Heads that was &s;truck into them by our Confine the <HI>Delawares,</HI> it was a <HI>French</HI> Hatchet that they unfortunately made u&s;e of, by the In&s;tiga|tion of the <HI>French</HI> we take it out of your Heads, and bury it under Ground, where it &s;hall always, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and never be taken up again. Our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares</HI> have a&s;&s;ured us they will never think of War again&s;t their Brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> any more, but employ their Thought about Peace, and cultivating Friend&s;hip with them, and never &s;uffer Enmity again&s;t them to enter into their Minds again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Delawares</HI> de&s;ired us to &s;ay this for them by this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Our Nephews, the <HI>Mini&s;ink Indians,</HI> and three other different Tribe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of that Nation, have, at la&s;t, li&s;tened to us, and taken our Advice, and laid down the Hatchet they had taken up again&s;t their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> They told us they had received it from the <HI>French,</HI> but had already laid it down, and would return it to them again.</P>
<P>They a&s;&s;ured us, they would never u&s;e it any more again&s;t you, but would follow our Advice, and entreated us to u&s;e our utmo&s;t Endeavours to reconcile them to you their Bre|thren, declaring they were &s;orry for what they had done, and de&s;ired it might be forgotten, and they would for ever cultivate a good Friend&s;hip with you. The&s;e Declarations were made by the principal Warriors of Four Tribes of the <HI>Mini&s;ink Indians</HI> at giving us this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Then, taking eight Strings of Black Wampum, he proceeded.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We let you know that we have not only brought about this Union with our Nephews on the Waters of the River <HI>Sa&s;quebannab,</HI> but al&s;o have &s;ent Me&s;&s;ages to our Nephews the <HI>Dela|wares</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> and to tho&s;e likewi&s;e of our own Nations, who are on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> under the Influence of the <HI>French.</HI> We have told all the&s;e that they mu&s;t lay down the <HI>French</HI> Hatchet, and be reconciled to their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and never more employ it again&s;t them, and we hope they will take our Advice. We the <HI>Mohawks, Senecas,</HI> and <HI>Onondagas,</HI> deliver this String of Wampum to remove the Hatchet out of your Heads, that has been &s;truck into them by the <HI>Ohio Indians,</HI> in order to lay a Foundation for Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Eight Strings of Black Wampum.</HI></P>

<P>We did not know it when it happened, but we di&s;covered it &s;ince.

<P><HI>Brethren, Chiefs and Warriors of the</HI> United Nations, <HI>and others your Brethren and Nephews, now met here,</HI> Agreeable to your Reque&s;t, at our fir&s;t Meeting, I now return you the Belt, which the young <HI>Seneca Indian</HI> brought me, with your An&s;wer to the Invitation I gave you to come down to this Council Fire.</P>
<P><HI>Here his Honour returned the Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I invited you to come down to the Council Fire kindled at this Place by me and your Nephew <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> with a De&s;ign to lay before you Matters of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence to you and us; I am now about to communicate them to you, and to an&s;wer all that has been &s;aid by you to me, &s;ince our meeting together; I therefore, by this String, open your Ears, that you may hear clearly, and carefully attend to what I &s;hall &s;ay to you.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t fir&s;t put you in Mind, that perfect Peace and Friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between you and your Brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in this Province, from our fir&s;t Settlement among you, and that whatever little Di&s;putes happened between your People and ours, they were amicably &s;ettled and adju&s;ted by our wi&s;e Men at our Council Fires, according to an Agreement made by our fir&s;t Proprietary WILLIAM PENN, and your Fathers. Had this wi&s;e Agreement been care|fully ob&s;erved, as it always ought to have been, our late unhappy Differences had never aro&s;e.

<P>We accept the Belt in their Behalf, and give you this Belt in Token of our Friend&s;hip and Reconciliation.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember, that the Day before Ye&s;terday, your Nephew <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> told me by this String, <Q>that he had already &s;aid to me, at our former Meetings, every Thing he had to &s;ay, and had made me acquainted with the Cau&s;e why he had &s;truck us, and that I knew what had pa&s;&s;ed between us.&mdash;That we had made up all Differences, and had done it, as far as we could, for our future Peace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That at my Reque&s;t he had given the Halloo, and brought down to this Place you who heard him, and are now pre&s;ent; and that he would &s;it by, and hear what we &s;aid to|gether.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As there are a great many of you here, who were not pre&s;ent at our former Meetings, I think it proper, for your Information, to give you a &s;hort Account of what has pa&s;&s;ed be|tween your Nephews the <HI>Delawares</HI> and us.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="008156_0010_102E3E5C4CCD30F0">About three Years ago your Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> living on the Borders of this Province, were &s;truck on a &s;udden, at a Time when they were in profound Peace with you, and fol|lowing their Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;u&s;pecting no Danger. Many were killed, and others carried away Captives.</P>
<P>We were &s;urprized, and did not know who &s;truck us, but &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers up the <HI>Sa&s;|quehannah,</HI> as far as the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Country, to enquire whence the Blow came, and for what Rea&s;on</P>
<P>On the Return of the&s;e Me&s;&s;engers, we were informed that the Hatchet had been &s;truck into our Heads by our Countrymen the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Some Time after this Di&s;covery was made, a Ce&s;&s;ation of Ho&s;tilities was brought about by the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> at our Reque&s;t, made to them for that Purpo&s;e by Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI>; and, upon our Invitation, our Brother <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> came down, with a Number of <HI>Dela|wares</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> to a Council Fire, kindled at this Place, where we have &s;ince had &s;everal Meetings.</P>
<P>At one of the&s;e Meetings <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> told us, that the Cau&s;e of the War was, their fooli&s;h young Men had been per&s;uaded by the fal&s;e-hearted <HI>French</HI> King to &s;trike their Bre|thren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; and one Rea&s;on why the Blow came harder was, that the Proprietaries of this Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> had taken from them by Fraud the Ground we now &s;tand on, and all the Lands lying between <HI>Tohiccon-Creek</HI> and <HI>Wyomink,</HI> on the River <HI>Sa&s;quehannah.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t all Blood was wiped away, and buried under Ground, and Peace Belts were ex|changed between us and our Brother <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> who then told us he acted in Behalf of Ten Nations, and promi&s;ed to bring in and re&s;tore to us all our Fellow-Subjects that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> been carried off Pri&s;oners by them.</P>
<P>For the Truth of this &s;hort Relation I refer you to our Brother <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> who will confirm it to you more particularly.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>To continue our Friend&s;hip, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve Faith, and keep the Pro|mi&s;es we make with each other.</P>
<P>I will &s;peak plainly to you, and from the Bottom of my Heart, as one Friend ought to another, that nothing may lie heavy on my Mind to di&s;turb me hereafter; and I expect the &s;ame Openne&s;s and Freedom on your Parts.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire therefore to know the true Rea&s;on, why our Fle&s;h and Blood, who are in Capti|vity, and in your Power, have not been delivered to us, according to the Promi&s;e made us by our Brother <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> in Behalf of all the <HI>Indians</HI> he repre&s;ented; and what is be|come of tho&s;e Belts we gave him to confirm the Peace, and that Promi&s;e; for till that Pro|mi&s;e is complied with, we can never &s;leep in Quiet, or re&s;t &s;atisfied in the Friend&s;hip of tho&s;e who detain our Children and Relations from us.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>After the Governor had done &s;peaking, the <HI>United Nations</HI> gave the u&s;ual Shouts of Ap|probation, with great Solemnity, each according to Rank.</P>
<P>Then Governor <HI>Bernard</HI> delivered the Belts reque&s;ted by the <HI>Senecas, Cayugas,</HI> and <HI>Mini|&s;inks,</HI> and &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> has given a particular An&s;wer to what has been &s;aid to us both. So far as his An&s;wer relates to the Province over which I pre&s;ide, I confirm what has been &s;aid by this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Previous to what follows, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that <HI>Pi&s;quitomen,</HI> and another <HI>Ohio In|dian,</HI> having come to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> la&s;t Summer, acquainted the Governor, that the <HI>Indians</HI> in tho&s;e Parts had not received any Account of the late Tran&s;actions with this Government, not any Me&s;&s;age from it; and that they might be per&s;uaded to lay down the Hatchet, the Go|vernor therefore took that Opportunity to &s;end a friendly Me&s;&s;age to tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> by <HI>Pi&s;|quitomen,</HI> and appointed Mr. <HI>Frederick Po&s;t,</HI> a <HI>German,</HI> who under&s;tood the <HI>Delaware</HI> Lan|guage, to attend him, and acquaint the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Ohio</HI> of the Peace made by the <HI>Sa&s;que|hannah</HI>

<HI>Delawares&punc;</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> and the Di&s;po&s;ition of this Government to forgive what was pa&s;t, if they would return to their antient Alliance.

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>When I was at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> the chief Men &s;at together as we do here now. I was em|ployed by the Governor, <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael Pemberton,</HI> the&s;e three Men, pointing to them and the chief Men told me, that when I &s;hould come among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Inhabitants, I mu&s;t &s;hake Hands for them with the Governor, <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael Pemberton</HI> (here he &s;hook Hands with them) and that what they had to &s;ay, was written down in a Paper, which he then produced, and &s;aid they de&s;ired it might be read in Publick. Now you, Gen|tlemen, who are Head Men, &s;ent <HI>Frederick Po&s;t</HI> with me, de&s;iring me to take and carry him in my Bo&s;om there, and when I came there, to introduce him to the publick Council; I did this, and have brought him back &s;afe again.</P>
<P>Then taking a Belt, and three Strings of Wampum, which were delivered with the Paper, he &s;aid he would interpret them; but as all that was &s;aid was truly &s;et down in the Writing, it was not nece&s;&s;ary. Let it be read.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Pi&s;quitomen</HI> delivered the Paper, with the Belt and three Strings of Wampum, who, on being a&s;ked alterwards to whom they were &s;ent, an&s;wered, one was &s;ent to the Governor, another to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and another to <HI>I&s;rael Pemberton.</HI> The Me&s;&s;age was read in the&s;e Words.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Indians <HI>&s;peak now. Brethren, hear what I have to &s;ay.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t tell you we will not let that Friend&s;hip quite drop, which was formerly be|tween us.

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>If you will be &s;trong, it is in your Power to fini&s;h that Peace and Friend&s;hip well.</P>

<P>When you have &s;ettled the Peace and Friend&s;hip, and fini&s;hed it well, and you &s;end it to me, I will &s;end it to all the Nations of my Colour; when I receive of you the An&s;wer, and I have looked that every Thing is well done, &s;o that I can &s;end it to the Nations of my Colour, they all will join to it, and we all will hold it fa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>When all the Nations join to this Friend&s;hip, then the Day will begin to &s;hine clear over us. When we once hear more of you, and we join together, then the Day will be &s;till, and no Wind or Storm will come over us to di&s;turb us.</P>
<P>Now, Brethren, you know our Hearts, and what we have to &s;ay, be &s;trong; if you do &s;o, every Thing will be well; and what we have told you in this, all the Nations agree to join.</P>
<P>Now, Brethren, let the King of <HI>England</HI> know what our Minds are, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible you can.</P>

<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>WE thought proper to meet you here, to have &s;ome private Di&s;cour&s;e about our Ne|phew <HI>Teedyu&s;cung.</HI></P>
<P>You all know that he gives out, he is the great Man, and Chief of Ten Nations, this is his con&s;tant Di&s;cour&s;e. Now I, on Behalf of the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> &s;ay, we do not know he is &s;uch a great Man. If he is &s;uch a great Man, we de&s;ire to know who has made him &s;o. Perhaps you have, and if this be the Ca&s;e, tell us &s;o. It may be the <HI>French</HI> have made him &s;o. We want to enquire and know whence his Greatne&s;s aro&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I, for my Nation, &s;ay the &s;ame that <HI>Nichas</HI> has &s;aid; I need not repeat it. I &s;ay we do not know who has made <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> this great Man over Ten Nations; and I want to know who made him &s;o.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am here to repre&s;ent the <HI>Onondagoes,</HI> and I &s;ay, for them, that I never heard, before now, that <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> was &s;uch a great Man, and much le&s;s can I tell who made him &s;o. No &s;uch Thing was ever &s;aid in our Towns, as that <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> was &s;uch a great Man.</P>
<P>Thomas King <HI>&s;poke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren the Governors, and all pre&s;ent,</HI></P>
<P>Take Notice that I &s;peak in Behalf of Five Nations, who have their Deputies here pre|&s;ent, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Oneidoes, Cayugas, Tu&s;caroras, Nanticokes,</HI> and <HI>Conoys,</HI> who have joined to|gether, and now make one Nation, and <HI>Tuteloes.</HI> We Five are all connected together, and if any Thing is &s;aid to one of us, it is communicated to all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>On their Behalf I now tell you, we none of us know who has made <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;uch a great Man; perhaps the <HI>French</HI> have, or perhaps you have, or &s;ome among you, as you have different Governments, and are different People. We, for our Parts, entirely di&s;own that he has any Authority over us, and de&s;ire to know from whence he derives his Au|thority.</P>

<P>We &s;peak from the Bottom of our Hearts; we will look carefully into all our Towns for them. You &s;hall have them all. We will keep none.

You told us, a tender Father, Hu&s;band, Wife, Brother, or Si&s;ter could not &s;leep &s;ound, when they reflected that their Re|lations were Pri&s;oners.

<P>You told us, that you could not &s;leep &s;ound whil&s;t your Pri&s;oners were detained from you, nor could you have any Con&s;idence in the Friend&s;hip of tho&s;e who did detain them.</P>
<P>We of the&s;e three Nations promi&s;e, that we will u&s;e our be&s;t Endeavours to make you ea|&s;y. When we return, we will enquire of every Town for the Pri&s;oners.

<HEAD><HI>At a</HI> CONFERENCE <HI>with the</HI> Indians, <HI>on the</HI> 16<HI>th of</HI> October, 1758.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, <HI>The</HI> GOVERNORS, <HI>and the Gentlemen of their Councils,</HI> &amp;cc.</P>
<P>THE Minutes of the preceding Conferences were read, and approved.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of Ye&s;terday's private Conference were read at the particular De&s;ire of the Chiefs of the <HI>Eight Nations,</HI> and interpreted to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and the <HI>Delawares,</HI> in the <HI>Delawares</HI> Language, by Mr. <HI>Stephen Calvin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="008156_0014_102E3E66489DF690">The Governors then &s;poke &s;eparately; Governor <HI>Denny</HI> beginning as follow.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the</HI> Mohawks, Onondagoes, Senecas, Oneidoes, Cayugas, Tu&s;caroras, Nanticokes <HI>and</HI> Tuteloes,</P>
<P>In a Conference held with you Ye&s;terday, you told me, that we know your Nephew <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> gives out, that he is the great Man, and Chief of ten Nations, and that this was his con&s;tant Di&s;cour&s;e; by this Belt therefore you denied him to be &s;o great a Man, and de|&s;ired to know of me who made him &s;o, or gave him any Authority over you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I will an&s;wer you truly, and tell you, in a few Words, all that I know of the Matter; I have already informed you, that after the <HI>Delawares</HI> had &s;truck us, you, our good Friends the <HI>United Nations,</HI> advi&s;ed them to &s;it &s;till, and do us no more Mi&s;chief; and that &s;oon after this, we invited the <HI>Delawares</HI> to meet us at a Council Fire kindled at this Place.</P>
<P>We received an An&s;wer to our Me&s;&s;age from <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> as a Chief among the <HI>Delawares.</HI> At the Time appointed he came, and told us, that he repre&s;ented ten Nations, among&s;t which the <HI>United Nations</HI> were included, that he acted as a chief Man for the <HI>Delawares,</HI> but only as a Me&s;&s;enger for the <HI>United Nations,</HI> who were his Uncles and Superiors; to whom he would faithfully carry every Thing that &s;hould be tran&s;acted between us, that they might do as they &s;aw Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>We believed what your Nephew told us, and therefore made him a Coun&s;ellor and Agent for us, and de&s;ired him to publi&s;h to all Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> what we did at our Council Fires, and to let them know we were &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to be at Peace with them.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I can only &s;peak for my&s;elf, and do a&s;&s;ure you, that I never made <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> this great Man, nor ever presented to give him any Authority over you; and I mu&s;t do him the Ju&s;tice to declare to you, that, at our former publick Treaties, <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> never a&s;&s;umed any &s;uch Power, but, on many Occa&s;ions, when he &s;poke of you, called you his Uncles and Su|periors.</P>
<P>I never &s;hall attempt to nominate or impo&s;e a Chief on any <HI>Indian</HI> Tribe or Nation, but, on all Occa&s;ions, will pay due Regard to tho&s;e who are cho&s;en by their Countrymen.</P>
<P>If any others have made <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;o great a Man, as to &s;et him&s;elf above you, I am &s;or|ry for it. It is more than I know, and they who have done it mu&s;t an&s;wer for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be greatly concerned, that any Unea&s;ine&s;s &s;hould ari&s;e among you; and hope you will guard again&s;t it, and pre&s;erve that Harmony which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between Friends and Relations.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt and String, you premi&s;ed me to make diligent Search in your Towns for our Fle&s;h and Blood, who are Pri&s;oners among you, and return them to us.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We have always found you hone&s;t, and punctual in the Performance of your Promi&s;es; your Words therefore give me great Comfort, and fill all our Hearts with Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>We rely upon you that no Time may be lo&s;t in fulfilling an Engagement, on which our Peace and Quiet &s;o greatly depend.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt and String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then Governor</HI> Bernard <HI>&s;poke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren of all the Confederated Nations,</HI></P>
<P>As you propo&s;ed your Que&s;tion, concerning <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> &s;eparately, I think it proper to give you a &s;eparate An&s;wer thereto.</P>
<P>I know not who made <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;o great a Man, nor do I know that he is any greater than a Chief of the <HI>Delaware Indians,</HI> &s;ettled at <HI>Wyomink.</HI> The Title of King could not be given him by any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Governor; for we know very well, that there is no &s;uch Per&s;on among <HI>Indians,</HI> as what we call a King. And if we call him &s;o, we mean no more than a Sachem or Chief. I ob&s;erve, in his Treaties, which he has held with the Governors of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> (which I have peru&s;ed &s;ince our la&s;t Meeting) he &s;ays he was a Woman till you made him a Man, by putting a Tomahawk in his Hand; and through all of tho&s;e 
<PB N="15" REF="008156_0015_102E3E68C7FCE430">
Treaties, e&s;pecially in the la&s;t, held at this Town, he calls you his Uncles, and profe&s;&s;es that he is dependent on you; and I know not that any Thing has &s;ince happened to alter his Relation to you. I therefore con&s;ider him to be &s;till your Nephew.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I heartily thank you for your kind Promi&s;es to return the Captives which have been taken from us. I hope you will not only do &s;o, but will al&s;o engage &s;uch of your Allies and Ne|phews, who have taken Captives from us, to do the &s;ame. That you may be mindful of this, I give you this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>After the Governors had done &s;peaking, and their An&s;wers were interpreted in the <HI>Six Nation</HI> and <HI>Delaware</HI> Languages, the <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs were a&s;ked if they had any Thing more to &s;ay; on which <HI>Taga&s;kata</HI> aro&s;e, and made a Speech to his Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ink Indians,</HI> directing his Di&s;cour&s;e to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nephews,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember all that pa&s;&s;ed at this Council-Fire. The Governors who &s;it there have put you in Mind of what was agreed upon la&s;t Year. You both promi&s;ed to return the Pri&s;oners. We, your Uncles, put you in Mind of this Promi&s;e, and de&s;ire you will perform it. You have promi&s;ed it, and you mu&s;t perform it. We, your Uncles, have promi&s;ed to return all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners among us, and therefore we expect that you, our Cou&s;ins and Nephews, will do the &s;ame. As &s;oon as you come home, we de&s;ire that you will &s;earch carefully into your Towns for all the Pri&s;oners among you, that have been taken out of eve|ry Province, and cau&s;e them to be delivered up to your Brethren. You know that this is an Article of the Peace that was made between you and your Brethren, in Confirmation of which you received a large Peace Belt; of which Belt we de&s;ire you will give an Account, and let us know what is become of it, and how far you have proceeded in it.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>After this was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, it was ob&s;erved, that there were no <HI>Mini&s;ink Indians</HI> pre&s;ent; the Governors therefore de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Read</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> would procure a Meeting of the Chiefs of the <HI>United Nations,</HI> with the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> and cau&s;e the Speech of <HI>Taga&s;hata</HI> to be interpreted to the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of their Uncles.</P>
<P><HI>Robert White,</HI> the <HI>Nanticoke</HI> Chief, aro&s;e, and &s;aid he was going to &s;peak in the Behalf of &s;even Nations, and, directing his Di&s;cour&s;e to the Governors, he delivered him&s;elf in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language, as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It is now more than two Years pa&s;t, &s;ince we heard of our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares</HI> taking up the Hatchet again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> At the fir&s;t, Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Head Nations, and when they received it, they &s;ent one to us at <HI>Ot&s;aningo,</HI> telling us, that, as we lived clo&s;e by our Cou&s;ins, they de&s;ired we would invite them to meet at our Town, and accordingly we invited them, and they came to a great Meeting at our Town of <HI>Ot&s;aningo.</HI> We then gave our Cou&s;ins a Belt of a Fathom long, and Twenty-five Rows in Breadth, and de&s;ired them to lay down the Hatchet that they had taken up again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and to be ea&s;y with them; and if they would follow this Advice, we told them, that they would live in Peace, until their Heads were white with Age, otherwi&s;e it might not be &s;o with them.</P>
<P>Not hearing from our Cou&s;ins of &s;ome Time, what they did in Con&s;equence of this Belt, we &s;ent to them two other Belts, one of Sixteen, and the other of Twelve Rows, de&s;iring them once more to be ea&s;y with their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and not to &s;trike them any more; but &s;till we heard nothing from them: Indeed, &s;ome Time afterwards we under&s;tood the <HI>Dela|wares</HI> &s;hould &s;ay, that the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Ot&s;aningo</HI> had grey Eyes, and were like the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and &s;hould be &s;erved as <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI>; and we thought we &s;hould have had the Hatchet &s;truck into our Heads. We now want to know what is became of the&s;e Belts; may be they may be under Ground, or they have &s;wallowed them down their Throats.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As our Cou&s;ins have been loath to give any An&s;wer to the&s;e Belts, we now de&s;ire they may let us know, in a publick Conference, what they have done with them.</P>

<P>PRESENT, <HI>The</HI> GOVERNORS, <HI>Council, Gentlemen, and</HI> Indiana, <HI>with the Interpreters as before.</HI></P>
<P>MR. <HI>Read,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peters,</HI> acquainted the Governors, that, at a Meeting of the Chiefs of the Older and Younger Nations, with the &s;everal Tribes of the <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Mi|ni&s;ink Indians</HI> on <HI>Monday</HI> Night, the Speech of <HI>Taga&s;hata,</HI> delivered that Morning in the Publick Conference, re&s;pecting the giving up the Pri&s;oners, was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language by <HI>Stephen Calvin</HI>; and another Belt, on the Part of the Governors, being joined to <HI>Taga&s;hata</HI>'s Belt, they were both delivered to the <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> Chiefs, to en|force the Matter. When this was done <HI>Taga&s;hata</HI> &s;poke to the <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> Chief, <HI>Egohohowen,</HI> &s;aying, we were told by you that you had delivered up the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners, and we be|lieved you: But our Brethren have told us that they were not delivered up; and therefore we earne&s;tly de&s;ire that they may be made ea&s;y on this Article. You know, Cou&s;ins, that their Hearts will always be in Grief till they &s;ee again their Fle&s;h and Blood. It is natural that they &s;hould be &s;o. It would be &s;o with us, if it was our Ca&s;e. We de&s;ire you will be extremely careful to perform this Matter fully, and &s;oon. Let there be perfect Peace, over all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Country. And let it now be publi&s;hed, that we may all live in Peace, and with Satisfaction, now, and for ever. I told you, <HI>Egohohowen,</HI> when you was in my Town, to bring with you the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners, and that our Brethren would expect it. I wi&s;h you had done it. But however do it now with all Speed, and it will be well.</P>
<P><HI>Egohohowen</HI> an&s;wered, it is true, I was at my Uncle's Fire, and I believe he de&s;ired me to bring the Pri&s;oners down; but I &s;uppo&s;e it was not interpreted to me, for I did not under|&s;tand it clearly, but I now under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> and <HI>Delaware Indians</HI> were de&s;ired to collect all their Warriors together, and give them the&s;e Belts, and receive from them their An&s;wer, it being nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould concur heartily in whatever &s;hould be concluded.</P>
<P><HI>Nichas,</HI> the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Chief, acquainted the Governors, that, as Coun&s;ellors, they had fi|ni&s;hed, having nothing to propo&s;e at this pre&s;ent Meeting. The Warriors were to &s;peak now, and <HI>Thomas King</HI> was appointed to deliver their Words, who thereupon aro&s;e, and began with an Exhortation, as well to all concerned in publick Affairs, Governors and their Coun|cils, and <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs and their Councils, as to Warriors of all Nations, White People and <HI>Indians,</HI> de&s;iring all pre&s;ent to attend carefully to what was going to be related, as Matters of great Con&s;equence, which would &s;erve to regulate the Conduct of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> to each other. He added, that the Relation going to be made, had taken a great deal of Trou|ble to put it into Order, and it was made on Information given by the &s;everal <HI>Indians</HI> now pre&s;ent, who were acquainted with the Facts. Brethren, we the Warriors have waited &s;ome Time, in Hopes our Coun&s;ellors would have taken this Matter in hand, but as they have not done it, we have, at their De&s;ire, undertaken it, and they have approved of every Thing. I &s;ay, the Coun&s;ellors of the Five Younger Nations, as well as the Three Older Nations, have approved of what the Warriors are going to relate; and take Notice, that the Speech is not only the Speech of all the Warriors of the Elder and Younger Nations, but of our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;inks.</HI></P>
<P>This was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language; and <HI>Thomas King</HI> then proceeded, direct|ing his Speech to the Governors, and all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> upon the Continent.</P>

<P>You have been inqui&s;itive to know the Cau&s;e of this War; you have often enquired among us, but perhaps you did not find out the true Cau&s;e of the Bitterne&s;s of our Hearts, and may charge us wrong, and think that you were &s;truck without a Cau&s;e by &s;ome of our own War|riors, and by our Cou&s;ins. But if you look a little about you, you will find that you gave the fir&s;t Offence. For in Time of profound Peace, &s;ome of the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> to go to War with their Enemies, were taken up, and put in Pri&s;on. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> knew they were going to War, and that they u&s;ed to do it every Year; and yet, after they had per&s;uaded them in a friendly Way into their Hou&s;es, they were taken up, and put into Pri&s;on, and one, who was an Head Man of that Nation, lo&s;t his Life, and the others were &s;everely u&s;ed. This fir&s;t rai&s;ed Ill-will in the Minds of the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> and as the <HI>French</HI> came a little after this happened to &s;ettle on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> the <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> complained of it to them, and they made an artful U&s;e of it, &s;et them again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and gave them the 
<PB N="17" REF="008156_0017_102E3E6DD7590530">
Hatchet. Being re&s;olved on Revenge, they accepted it, and likewi&s;e &s;poke to their Grand|fathers the <HI>Delawares,</HI> &s;aying, Grandfathers, Are not your Hearts fore at our being u&s;ed &s;o ill, and at the Lo&s;s of one of our Chiefs? Will not you join us in revenging his Death? So by Degrees our young Men were brought over to act again&s;t you. On &s;earching Matters to the Bottom, you will find that you, in this Manner, gave the fir&s;t Offence. This we thought proper to let you know. It may be of Service for the future. You may be induced by this to take better Care in conducting your Council Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o as to guard again&s;t the&s;e Breaches of Friend&s;hip; or, as &s;oon as they happen, in corre&s;ponding immediately with one another, and with the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, who are in any wi&s;e concerned, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Eight Strings of black Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>This was the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> that I have ju&s;t now related. Another of the like Nature has &s;ince happened to the <HI>Senecas,</HI> who have &s;uffered in the &s;ame Manner.</P>
<P>About three Years ago, eight <HI>Seneca</HI> Warriors were returning from War, through <HI>Virgi|nia,</HI> having &s;even Pri&s;oners and Scalps with them; at a Place called <HI>Green Briar,</HI> they met with a Party of Soldiers, not le&s;s than One Hundred and Fifty, who kindly invited them to come to a certain Store, and &s;aid, they would &s;upply them with Provi&s;ions; and accordingly they travelled two Days with them in a friendly Manner, and when they came to the Hou&s;e, they took their Arms from the <HI>Senecas</HI>: The head Men cried out, here is Death; defend your&s;elves as well as you can, which they did, and two of them were killed on the Spot, and one, a young Boy, was taken Pri&s;oner. This gave great Offence, and the more &s;o, as it was upon the Warriors Road, and we were in perfect Peace with our Brethren. It provo|ked us to &s;uch a Degree, that we could not get over it.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have ju&s;tly demanded your Pri&s;oners; it is right, and we have given you an An&s;wer. And therefore, as we think this young Boy is alive, and &s;omewhere among you, we de&s;ire you will enquire for him. If he be alive, return him; if you have &s;wallowed him down your Throats, which perhaps may be the Cafe, let us know it, and we will be content. His Name is <HI>Squi&s;&s;atego.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Six Strings of white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Prethren,</HI></P>
<P>We have one Word more to mention of the &s;ame Nature, and which was the very Cau&s;e why the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Ohio</HI> left you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>When we fir&s;t beard of the <HI>French</HI> coming to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> we immediately &s;ent Word to the Governors of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI>; we de&s;ired them to come, and likewi&s;e to &s;upply us with &s;uch Things as were proper for War, intending to defend our Lands, and hinder the <HI>French</HI> from taking the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. But the&s;e Governors did not attend to our Me&s;|&s;age; perhaps they thought there was no Foundation for our Intelligence. The <HI>French,</HI> how|ever, came, and became our Neighbours, and you neither coming your&s;elves, nor a&s;&s;i&s;ting us with warlike Stores, our People, of Nece&s;&s;ity, were obliged to trade with them for what we wanted, as your Traders had left the Country. The Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> took Care to &s;ettle on our Lands for his own Benefit; but when we wanted his A&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> he di&s;regarded us.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>At this Treaty you ju&s;tly demanded to &s;ee your Fle&s;h and Blood. We have pre&s;&s;ed this on our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> and they, by this String, de&s;ired us to a&s;&s;ure you, the Gover|nors, that they would make &s;trict Search in their Towns, and &s;incerely comply with your Reque&s;t, and return all the Pri&s;oners in their Power.</P>
<P><HI>Two Strings of black and white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P>Then directing his Di&s;cour&s;e to the Governor of the <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> he proceeded.</P>
<P><HI>Brother, the Governor of</HI> Jer&s;ey,</P>
<P>Our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Mini&s;inks</HI> tell us, they were wronged out of a great deal of Land, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettling &s;o fa&s;t, they were pu&s;hed back, and could not tell what Lands belonged to them. If we have been drunk, tell us &s;o. We may have forgot what we &s;old, but we tru&s;t to you the Governor of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> to take our Cau&s;e in Hand, and &s;ee that we have Ju&s;tice done us. We &s;ay that we have here and there Tracts of Land, that have never been &s;old. You deal hardly with us; you claim all the wild Creatures, and will not let us come on your Land to hunt after them. You will not &s;o much as let us peel a &s;ingle Tree; this is hard, and has given us great Offence. The Cattle you rai&s;e are your own; but tho&s;e which are wild, are 
<PB N="18" REF="008156_0018_102E3E706285B138">
&s;till ours, and &s;hould be common to both; for our Nephews, when they &s;old the Land, did not propo&s;e to deprive them&s;elves of hunting the wild Deer, or u&s;ing a Stick of Wood, when they &s;hould have Occa&s;ion. We de&s;ire the Governor to take this Matter into his Care, and &s;ee Ju&s;tice done in it.</P>
<P><HI>Two Strings of white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>All that has been &s;aid has been of one Nature, that is, of Matters that are Subjects of Di&s;pute; this that I am now going to &s;peak upon is of another Nature.</P>
<P>Then, directing him&s;elf to the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> he &s;aid,</P>
<P>We mu&s;t put you in Mind, that four Years ago, you bought at <HI>Albany</HI> a large Tract of Land over <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> extending from the Mouth of <HI>John Penn's</HI> Creek to the <HI>Ohio.</HI> The Proprietaries Agents then paid <HI>One Thou&s;and Pieces of Eight</HI> for the Part which was &s;ettled by your People, that have been &s;ince driven off and killed. We acknowledge to have received Pay|ment for tho&s;e Parts that were &s;ettled, but for the other Part that we have not received Pay|ment for, that we reclaim. Our Warriors, or Hunters, when they heard that we had &s;old &s;uch a large Tract, di&s;approved our Conduct in Council; &s;o now we acquaint you, that we are determined not to confirm any more, than &s;uch of the Lands as the Con&s;ideration was paid for, and were &s;ettled; tho' included in the Deed, they are our hunting Grounds, and we de&s;ire the Reque&s;t may be granted, and Notice taken, that it was made in open Confer|ence.</P>
<P><HI>Three white Strings.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Thomas King</HI> &s;at down.</P>
<P>The <HI>Six Nation</HI> Chiefs being a&s;ked if they had any Thing to &s;ay, an&s;wered, that they had done; and having ea&s;ed their Minds of all that lay heavy upon them, they would re|turn home.</P>
<P>The Governors promi&s;ed attentively to con&s;ider what was &s;aid, and give them an An&s;wer.</P>
<P>Teedyu&s;cung <HI>then aro&s;e, and &s;poke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould have &s;aid &s;omething at the Time our Uncles laid before you their Grievances, or Cau&s;es of Complaint, in Behalf of my Countrymen who lived near <HI>Go&s;hen.</HI> About three Years ago nine of their People were killed at <HI>Go&s;hen,</HI> when they were in Peace. I will not take upon me to &s;ay that the Land had never been &s;old, but there was no Di&s;pute about this at that Time. I verily believe that they killed tho&s;e nine <HI>Indians,</HI> for no other Rea&s;on than becau&s;e they were hunting on that Land. I &s;peak to all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> when I mention this, as what was very wrong.</P>
<P><HI>Three white Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>One of the <HI>Waping</HI> Tribes, or <HI>Ge&s;hen Indians,</HI> tells me, that, as &s;oon as tho&s;e nine Men were killed, he went with three Belts, and Tears in his Eyes, to <HI>George Freeland</HI>'s, in order to have the Matter made up; but he never received an An&s;wer to this Day, tho' he told him that he would &s;end the Belts to the Governor, and as &s;oon as he &s;hould receive his An&s;wer, he would &s;end for him, and let him know it; but he has never yet received any An&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I give you this String, to enquire what became of the three Belts, and what An&s;wer was made to them.</P>
<P><HI>Three Strings of white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember we made Peace la&s;t Year, and a Peace Belt was made, a Fathom long, and of Fifteen Rows. Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> was pre&s;ent, &s;o were &s;ome of my Uncles, and the <HI>Mini&s;inks.</HI> They all &s;aw it. You have a&s;ked me what is become of that Belt, and how far it went. I will tell you; I &s;ent it up the <HI>Sa&s;quehannah</HI> to <HI>Diahoga</HI>; from thence it went to <HI>A&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in</HI>; thence to <HI>Secaughkung.</HI> The chief Men there got together to con&s;ider what was be&s;t to be done with it. They all concluded that it &s;hould be &s;ent to our Uncle. He is a Man, and often told us he ought to &s;ee Things fir&s;t, and con&s;ider what is to be done. The <HI>Senecas</HI> had the Belt the fir&s;t, and then all the <HI>United Nations</HI> afterwards; they had it almo&s;t a Year. Now it is come back, and in <HI>Lapachpeton</HI>'s Hands, who is one of the <HI>De|lawares,</HI> and lives at <HI>Secaughkung.</HI> How far the Peace Belt went, I don't know; but I &s;uppo&s;e it went thro' all my Uncles, and I a&s;&s;ure you I will do as my Uncle does. He has promi&s;ed you he will deliver up all your Captives, and I a&s;&s;ure you I will do &s;o, where&s;o|ever I find them, in all my Towns. Four Tribes, now pre&s;ent, have agreed to this, <HI>viz.</HI> <PB N="19" REF="008156_0019_102E3E74569791C0"><HI>Delawares, Unamies, Mohiccons,</HI> and <HI>Wapings,</HI> who are &s;ettled as far as <HI>Secaughkung.</HI> This Belt confirms my Words.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I did let you know formerly what my Grievance was. I told you, that from <HI>Tohiccon</HI> as far as the <HI>Delawares</HI> owned, the Proprietaries had wronged me. Then you and I agreed that it &s;hould be laid before the King of <HI>England</HI>; and likewi&s;e you told me you would let me know, as &s;oon as ever he &s;aw it. You would lay the Matter before the King, for you &s;aid he was our Father, that he might &s;ee what were our Differences; for as you and I could not decide it, let him do it. Now let us not alter what you and I have agreed. Now let me know if King GEORGE has decided the Matter between you and me. I don't pretend to mention any of my Uncles Lands, I only mention what we the <HI>Delawares</HI> own, as far as the Heads of <HI>Delaware.</HI> All the Lands lying on the Waters that fall into the <HI>Sa&s;quehan|nah,</HI> belong to our Uncles.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> then took up another Belt, de&s;igning to &s;peak to his Uncles the <HI>United Na|tions</HI>; but whil&s;t he was delivering the above, their Chiefs had one after another left the Council, &s;eemingly much di&s;plea&s;ed, he therefore declined &s;peaking it.</P>

<P>He could not tell who was in the right; but would &s;uppo&s;e there were &s;ome Lands un|fold, and upon that Suppo&s;ition would give them &s;ome Money, by Way of Con&s;ideration, for them, if they would propo&s;e a rea&s;onable Sum; and de&s;ired they would advi&s;e about it, and give an An&s;wer.</P>

<P>GOVERNOR <HI>Denny</HI> de&s;ired to know of <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> if he propo&s;ed to &s;peak, as the abrupt Departure of the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Chiefs from the Conference Ye&s;terday, had prevented him from fini&s;hing what he had to &s;ay.</P>

<P><HI>Uncles,</HI></P>
<P>According to our old Cu&s;tom, we u&s;ed to &s;peak to one another at home; but we are now met here on Bu&s;ine&s;s, I mu&s;t &s;peak to you in the Pre&s;ence of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Governors; and what I &s;hall &s;ay, I de&s;ire both you the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and my Uncles, who are here, will attend to.</P>

<P>I take this Opportunity of &s;peaking to you in the Pre&s;ence of our Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and two of their Governors; plea&s;e to take Notice what I am going to &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>Uncles,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember that you have placed us at <HI>Wyomink,</HI> and <HI>Shamokin,</HI> Places where <HI>Indians</HI> have lived before.

<P>I &s;it there as a Bird on a Bow; I look about, and do not know where to go; let me therefore come down upon the Ground, and make that my own by a good Deed, and I &s;hall then have a Home for ever; for if you, my Uncles, or I die, our Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will &s;ay, they have bought it from you, and &s;o wrong my Po&s;terity out of it.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren, Chiefs and Warriors of the</HI> Six United Nations, <HI>and your Nephews, here a&s;&s;embled,</HI></P>
<P>I am much obliged to you for the Account you gave me the Day before Ye&s;terday, <HI>of</HI> the true Cau&s;e of the Bitterne&s;s of your Hearts towards us, and the Rea&s;ons which induced &s;ome of your young Men fir&s;t to &s;trike us, and others to &s;ide with the <HI>French</HI> on the <HI>Ohio.</HI></P>
<P>The Advice you gave us, to take better Care and guard again&s;t any Breach of Friend&s;hip between us for the future, is very kind and whol&s;ome; we will join with you, and endea|vour to prevent the like Evils for the Time to come.</P>
<P>I promi&s;e you, that I will immediately &s;end to the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> to enquire after the <HI>Seneca</HI> Boy, <HI>Squi&s;&s;atego,</HI> who you &s;ay was left a Pri&s;oner in his Country, and if he is alive, you may depend on his being returned to you.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By the&s;e Strings you put me in Mind, that the Proprietaries, four years ago, bought of you at <HI>Albany,</HI> a large Tract of Land over <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> from the Mouth of a Creek called <HI>Kayarondinhagh,</HI> or <HI>John Penn's Creek,</HI> to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> and were paid by the Proprietaries Agents <HI>One Thou&s;and Pieces of Eight,</HI> as the Con&s;ideration Money for &s;uch Parts as were &s;ettled by our People; but that, as your Warriors di&s;approved of your Conduct in Council for making that Sale, you now reclaimed &s;uch of the Lands contained in that Grant, as you have not received a Con&s;ideration for.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Proprietaries of this Province have, on all Occa&s;ions, manife&s;ted their particular Regard for you; they prefer your Friend&s;hip and the publick Good to their own private Intere&s;t. Their former Conduct gives you no Room to doubt the Truth of this; what I am about to tell you is a further Confirmation of it; therefore give me your Attention, and li&s;ten to what I &s;hall &s;ay. You may remember, that, at a Treaty you held with your good Friend Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> three Years ago, &s;ome of your wi&s;e men told him, that there were &s;ome among them who were di&s;&s;atisfied with the Sale of the above Lands, made by them at <HI>Albany,</HI> and were de&s;irous 
<PB N="21" REF="008156_0021_102E3E77635E3EB8">
that Part of it &s;hould be re&s;erved for them, though the Proprietaries had purcha&s;ed it fairly of them, and paid <HI>One Thou&s;and Pieces of Eight,</HI> which was all they were to receive, till our People &s;ettled to the We&s;tward of the <HI>Allegheny,</HI> or <HI>Appalaccian Hills.</HI> Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> repre&s;ented this Matter to the Proprietaries, in your Behalf, whereupon they chearfully agreed to relea&s;e to you all that Part of the Purcha&s;e you have reclaimed, and, by a Letter of Attorney, em|powered <HI>Richard Peters,</HI> and <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er,</HI> to execute a Deed to you for tho&s;e Lands, on your confirming to them the Re&s;idue of that Purcha&s;e. On this Subject therefore you will plea&s;e to confer with them, and &s;ettle the Boundaries between you, that they may relea&s;e the Lands to you accordingly, before you leave this Place, and &s;et your Minds at Ea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I thank you for the Pains you have taken with your Nephews, to prevail with them to re|turn us &s;uch of our Brethren as are Pri&s;oners among them, and we depend on the &s;peedy Per|formance of their Promi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;omething to &s;ay to you which is of the utmo&s;t Importance to us all; it requires your particular Attention and Con&s;ideration. Providence has brought you and your Nephews to|gether at this Meeting, Face to Face with us, that every Thing may be &s;ettled, and nothing remain, not &s;o much as a Doubt, to create any Unea&s;ine&s;s in our Hearts hereafter. You know, Brethren, that there is an old Agreement between the Proprietaries and you, that you will not &s;ell any of the Lands lying within this Province to any one but them, and they ne|ver take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lands t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> they have bought them of the <HI>Indians.</HI> You know al&s;o, that the <HI>United Nations</HI> have &s;old Lands to the Proprietaries, which your Nephews the <HI>Delawares</HI> now claim as their Right. This is the Ca&s;e with Regard to &s;ome Part of the Lands lying between <HI>Toiccon</HI> Creek and the Head of <HI>Delaware</HI> River, which <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> in your Hear|ing, the Day before Ye&s;terday, &s;aid, the Proprietaries had defrauded him of. The Proprie|taries are de&s;irous to do &s;trict Ju&s;tice to all the <HI>Indians,</HI> but it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed they can know in which of you the Right was ve&s;ted. It is a Matter that mu&s;t be &s;ettled among your|&s;elves; till this is done, there will probably remain &s;ome Jealou&s;y and Di&s;content among you, that may interrupt both your and our future Quiet, which we &s;hould guard again&s;t by all Means in our Power.</P>

<P>I now acquaint you, that a Store of all Sorts of Goods for your U&s;e is opened at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> where the <HI>Indians</HI> may be &s;upplied, at the mo&s;t rea&s;onable Rates, with any Goods they want, and the be&s;t Prices will be given to you for &s;uch Skins, Furs and Peltry, as you &s;hall bring them. Another Store is intended to be opened at <HI>Fort Allen,</HI> and you may depend upon it that &s;uch Per&s;ons will be placed there, who &s;hall u&s;e you with the &s;tricte&s;t Ju&s;tice in all their Dealings.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyu&s;cung,</P>
<P>As I under&s;tood at our la&s;t Meeting, that you were prevented at that Time, by the Ab&s;ence of &s;ome of the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Chiefs, from fini&s;hing what you then had to &s;ay, I defer an|&s;wering, for the pre&s;ent, &s;uch Parts of your Speech as relate to me. But I &s;hall &s;oon take an Opportunity of doing it.</P>
<P>This was interpreted to the <HI>Delawares</HI> by <HI>I&s;aac Stille.</HI></P>
<P>After the Governor had done &s;peaking, <HI>Taga&s;hata</HI> and <HI>Nichas</HI> aro&s;e, and &s;aid, they did not rightly under&s;tand that Paragraph relating to the Lands, and requiring them to &s;ettle Matters among them&s;elves; they &s;aid the Governor had left Matters in the Dark; they did not know what Lands he meant. If he meant the Lands on the other Side of the Mountain, he knew the Proprietaries had their Deeds for them, which ought to be produced and &s;hewn to them. Their Deeds had their Marks, and when they &s;hould &s;ee them, they would know their Marks again.</P>
<P>And then <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er</HI> being de&s;ired to bring the Deed, Governor <HI>Bernard</HI> informed the <HI>Indians</HI> he was going to &s;peak to them; on which they acquainted him, that they cho&s;e to be &s;poke to by one Governor only at a Conference; for that when they both &s;poke, their Belts were mixed, and they were thereby confu&s;ed in their Councils. Whereupon he deferred his Speech to another Time.</P>
<P>The Deed was then produced to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and <HI>Nichas</HI> &s;aid, this Deed we well remem|ber; we know our Chiefs who &s;igned it; &s;ome of them are pre&s;ent now; we &s;old the Land, and were hone&s;tly paid for it; the Land was ours, and we will ju&s;tify it. They were de&s;ired 
<PB N="22" REF="008156_0022_102E3E79E8F6E870">
to take it with them into their Council Room, and confer on it, and &s;ettle the Matter among them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>The Conference then broke up.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> having Ye&s;terday reque&s;ted of the Governor, that two Belts, which he then pre&s;ented to him, might be &s;ent as their joint Belts to the <HI>Ohio Indians:</HI></P>
<P>This Day the Chiefs of the <HI>United Nations,</HI> and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> had a Meeting with two Members of Governor <HI>Denny</HI>'s Council, at which the following intended An&s;wer from Go|vernor <HI>Denny</HI> to the <HI>Ohio Indians,</HI> being fir&s;t interpreted to the <HI>Indians,</HI> was con&s;idered, &s;et|tled, and approved by all pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Governor</HI> DENNY'<HI>s An&s;wer to the Me&s;&s;age of the</HI> Ohio Indians, <HI>brought by</HI> Frederick Po&s;t, Pi&s;quitomen, <HI>and</HI> Thomas Hickman.</P>
<P>BY this String, my <HI>Indian</HI> Brethren of the <HI>United Nations</HI> and <HI>Delawares,</HI> join with me in requiring of the <HI>Indian</HI> Councils, to which the&s;e following Me&s;&s;ages &s;hall be pre|&s;ented, to keep every Thing private from the Eyes and Ears of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We received your Me&s;&s;age by <HI>Pi&s;quitomen</HI> and <HI>Frederick Po&s;t,</HI> and thank you for the Care you have taken of our Me&s;&s;enger of Peace, and that you have put him in your Bo&s;om, and protected him again&s;t our Enemy <HI>Onontio</HI> and his Children, and &s;ent him &s;afe back to our Council Fire, by the &s;ame Man that received him from us.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I only &s;ent <HI>Po&s;t</HI> to peep into your Cabbins, and to know the Sentiments of your old Men, and to look at your Faces, to &s;ee how you look. And I am glad to hear from him that you look friendly, and that there &s;till remains &s;ome Sparks of Love towards us. It is what we believed before-hand, and therefore we never let &s;lip the Chain of Friend&s;hip, but held it fa&s;t on our Side, and it has never dropped our of our Hands. By this Belt we de&s;ire you will dig up your End of the Chain of Friend&s;hip, that you &s;uffered, by the Subtilty of the <HI>French,</HI> to be buried.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It happened that the Governor of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> was with me, and a great many <HI>Indian</HI> Brethren, &s;itting in Council at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> when your Me&s;&s;engers arrived, and it gave Plea&s;ure to every one that heard it; and it will afford the &s;ame Satisfaction to our neighbouring Governors, and their People, when they come to hear it. I &s;hall &s;end Me&s;&s;engers to them, and acquaint them with what you have &s;aid.</P>
<P>Your reque&s;ting us to let the King of <HI>England</HI> know your good Di&s;po&s;itions, we took to Heart, and &s;hall let him know it, and we will &s;peak in your Favour to His Maje&s;ty, who has, for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, looked upon you as his lo&s;t Children. And we can a&s;&s;ure you, that, as a tender Father over all his Children, he will forgive what is pa&s;t, and receive you a|gain into his Arms.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>If you are in Earne&s;t to be reconciled to us, you will keep your young Men from attack|ing our Country, and killing and carrying Captive, our Back Inhabitants. And will likewi&s;e give Orders that your People may be kept at a Di&s;tance from <HI>Fort Duque&s;ne,</HI> that they may not be hurt by our Warriors, who are &s;ent by our King to cha&s;ti&s;e the <HI>French,</HI> and not to hurt you. Con&s;ider the commanding Officer of that Army treads heavy, and would be very &s;orry to hurt any of his <HI>Indian</HI> Brethren.</P>

<P><HI>And Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Chiefs of the <HI>United Nations,</HI> with their Cou&s;ins, our Brethren the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and others now here, jointly with me &s;end this Belt, which has upon it two Figures that repre&s;ent all the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and all the <HI>Indians</HI> now pre&s;ent, taking Hands, and delivering it to <HI>Pi&s;quito|men,</HI> and we de&s;ire it may be likewi&s;e &s;ent to the <HI>Indians,</HI> who are named at the End of the&s;e Me&s;&s;ages

<P><HI>Brethren on the</HI> Ohio,</P>
<P>If you take the Belts we ju&s;t now gave you, in which all here join, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> as we don't doubt you will; then, by this Belt, I make a Road for you, and invite you to <PB N="23" REF="008156_0023_102E3E7B70679618">come to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to your fir&s;t old Council Fire, which was kindled when we fir&s;t &s;aw one another; which Fire we will kindle up again, and remove all Di&s;putes, and renew the old and fir&s;t Treaties of Friend&s;hip. This is a clear and open Road for you; fear therefore nothing, and come to us with as many as can be, of the <HI>Delawares, Shawane&s;e,</HI> or of the <HI>Six Nation Indians.</HI> We will be glad to &s;ee you; we de&s;ire all Tribes and Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> who are in Alliance with you, may come. As &s;oon as we hear of your coming, of which you will give us timely Notice, we will lay up Provi&s;ions for you along the Road.</P>
<P><HI>A large white Belt, with the Figure of a Man at each End, and Streaks of black, repre&s;enting the Road from the</HI> Ohio <HI>to</HI> Philadelphia.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Six Nation</HI> and <HI>Delaware</HI> Chiefs join with me in tho&s;e Belts, which are tied to|gether, to &s;ignify our Union and Friend&s;hip for each other; with them we jointly take the Tomahawks out of your Heads, and bury them under Ground.</P>
<P>We &s;peak loud, &s;o as you may hear us; you &s;ee we all &s;tand together, joined Hand in Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Two Belts tied together.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs being a&s;ked, if it would not be proper to in&s;ert in the Me&s;&s;age an Ac|count of the Situation of our Army to the We&s;tward, and to de&s;ire them to join General <HI>Forbes,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>French</HI>; they replied, that they would by no Means advi&s;e this Govern|ment &s;o &s;oon to pre&s;s them to take up the Hatchet, becau&s;e their Wounds were not yet heal|ed, nor Peace made, which mu&s;t fir&s;t be done. They &s;aid further, that as the <HI>French</HI> had many <HI>Indians</HI> fighting for them, and they by Intermarriages were related to the <HI>Indians</HI> who &s;ent the Me&s;&s;ages, it could not be expected they would ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded to join the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t they &s;hould kill their own Fle&s;h and Blood, adding, that the only proper Mea&s;ure that could now be taken, was to advi&s;e them to &s;it &s;till, and keep out of the Way, and this Advice they believed would be hearkened to.</P>
<P>They then de&s;ired, that at lea&s;t two of our Inhabitants might accompany <HI>Pi&s;quitomen</HI> and <HI>Thomas Hickman,</HI> the two Me&s;&s;engers, to the <HI>Ohio.</HI> The <HI>Six Nation</HI> Chiefs promi&s;ed to &s;end two of their own People with them; and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;aid he would &s;end one, it not two <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>

<P>HIS Excellency informed them, that he met them to agree about the Price of the un|certain Claims of the <HI>Mini&s;inks, Wapings,</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> Claimants of Land in the Northern Parts of the Province of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> and de&s;ired that it might be con&s;idered, that they knew not what they &s;old, and he knew not what he bought; therefore the Price ought not to be large.</P>
<P>That they might propo&s;e a Sum to him, or he would make an Offer to them; or it &s;hould be left to their Uncles to confider of a Price, as would plea&s;e them be&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mingoes,</HI> or <HI>Six United Nations,</HI> by <HI>Thomas King,</HI> &s;aid, that the <HI>United Nations</HI> had no Claim to the Lands of the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> or others their Nephews, on the Ea&s;t Side of <HI>De|laware,</HI> and &s;hould therefore leave the fixing a Price to them.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Mini&s;inks</HI> and <HI>Wapings</HI> withdrew to con&s;ult upon it; and being returned, <HI>Ego|hohowen,</HI> the <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> Chief, &s;aid, they would chu&s;e the Governor &s;hould make an Offer, as they might perhaps demand too much.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="008156_0024_102E3E804698D7C0">His Excellency, having con&s;ulted the Commi&s;&s;ioners, offered them <HI>Eight Hundred</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>Dollars</HI> for their Claim in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> as an extraordinary Price.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mini&s;inks</HI> &s;aid, they &s;hould be glad of the Opinion of their Uncles in the Matter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mingoes,</HI> or <HI>United Nations,</HI> by <HI>Thomas King,</HI> &s;aid, that it was a fair and honourable Offer, and that if it were their own Ca&s;e, they would chearfully accept of it; but as there were a great many Per&s;ons to &s;hare in the Purcha&s;e-money, they recommended it to his Ex|cellency to add <HI>Two Hundred Dollars</HI> more; and if that was complied with, the Report of it would be carried to all the Nations, and would be a great Proof of the Affection and Ge|nero&s;ity of their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> on this Occa&s;ion, and would be very agreeable to them.</P>
<P>His Excellency de&s;ired to know of the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> and other Claimants, if they approved of the Propo&s;al of their Uncles, and they informed him that they did.</P>
<P>The Governor, after con&s;ulting the Commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;aid, it was more than he had intended to give; but as the <HI>United Nations</HI> had given them&s;elves the Trouble of being Med<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tors be|tween them, he could not refu&s;e their Recommendations, and was glad of the Opportunity he had of &s;hewing his Regard to the <HI>United Nations,</HI> and his Benevolence to the <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> who had re&s;ided in the Province where he pre&s;ided, and therefore complied with their Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>His Excellency then de&s;ired them to remember, that this Con&s;ideration Money was to be in full for the Claims of all the <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> and <HI>Waping Indians,</HI> and all others who claim any Lands in a Map, which was laid before them at the &s;ame Time, which included all the Lands from the Line between the Provinces of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> and down <HI>Hud|&s;on</HI>'s River, to the Mouth of <HI>Rariton,</HI> up the &s;ame to <HI>Laometang</HI> Falls, on the North Branch of <HI>Rariton</HI> River; thence on a &s;trait Line to <HI>Paeoqualin</HI> Mountain, where it joins on <HI>Dela|ware</HI> River; and thence up the <HI>Delaware</HI> to <HI>Cu&s;hyhink</HI>; and recommended it to them to have re&s;pect to this in the Divi&s;ion of the Con&s;ideration Money.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Taga&s;hata,</HI> the <HI>Seneca</HI> Chief, aro&s;e, and, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> and other <HI>Indian</HI> Claimants, &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>My Nephews,</HI></P>
<P>I de&s;ire you will now give over all Thoughts of your Land, and that we may hear no more Complaints about it.</P>
<P>Now you mu&s;t remember the Friend&s;hip between you and your Brother, and tran&s;mit it to your Children; and make them acquainted with the Tran&s;actions of this Day. I recom|mend this to you, not from my Lips only, but from the Bottom of my Heart. I hope it will al&s;o make a deep Impre&s;&s;ion in your Hearts.</P>
<P>It &s;eems as if your Grandfathers had not told you of the Treaties they u&s;ed to have with their Brethren, but carried them with them to the Grave. But we hope you will not do &s;o, but carefully inform your Children of your Agreements. We have given you this Advice, and hope you will follow it. We al&s;o expect you will take Care of your young Men, that they do no more Violence to their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Egohohowen</HI> then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Governor, and de&s;ired to be heard.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We are now thoroughly &s;atisfied, and we &s;till retain a Friend&s;hip for our Brethren the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> and we de&s;ire, that if we &s;hould come into your Province to &s;ee our old Friends, and &s;hould have Occa&s;ion for the Bark of a Tree to over a Cabbin, or a little Refre&s;hment, that we &s;hould not be denied, but be treated as Brethren; and that your People may not look on the wild Bea&s;ts of the Fore&s;t, or Fi&s;h of the Waters, as their &s;ole Property, but that we may be admitted to an equal U&s;e of them.</P>
<P>The Governor an&s;wered, that, as &s;oon as he got home, he &s;hould i&s;&s;ue a Proclamation to notify to the People of his Province, that he had made a Peace with them; and to order, that, for the future, they &s;hould be treated as Brethren, which he hoped would be done; but de&s;ired that they would not go into tho&s;e Parts where they had lately committed Ho&s;tili|ties, till the Peoples Pa&s;&s;ions were cooled; for he could not be an&s;werable for his Peoples Behaviour, whil&s;t their Lo&s;&s;es were fre&s;h upon their Minds.</P>

<P>Teedyu&s;cung, <HI>on Behalf of the</HI> Delawares, <HI>aro&s;e, and &s;poke as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Uncles,</HI></P>
<P>I DESIRE you will hear me. We have gone &s;o far at this Treaty as to talk of Lands; I therefore thought proper to meet you here, to let you know that I have con&s;ulted with all my Brethren, your Cou&s;ins, here pre&s;ent, about the Deed you, our Uncles, &s;igned to the Proprietaries of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> &s;hewn to us Ye&s;terday, for the Lands beyond the <HI>Kittochtinny</HI> Hills.</P>
<P>We have &s;een the Deed, and know it well. <HI>Nutimus,</HI> one of our Chief Men, has &s;ign|ed it, and here &s;its one of our Men, named <HI>Philip Compa&s;s,</HI> who was pre&s;ent when the Sale was made; and remembers that <HI>Nutimus,</HI> our Chief, received <HI>Forty-four Dollars,</HI> as his Part or Share of the Con&s;ideration Money. We agree to it, and acknowledge that the Land was fairly &s;old. We give it up, and now confirm it. Let there be no Difference, nor any Thing more &s;aid about it. This is not the Land I have di&s;puted with my Brethren the <HI>Eng|li&s;h.</HI> That Land lies between <HI>Tohiccon</HI> Creek and the <HI>Kittochtinny</HI> Hills.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tokaaion,</HI> the <HI>Cayuga</HI> Chief, &s;tood up and &s;poke as follows, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Teedyu&s;|cung.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cou&s;in,</HI></P>
<P>I thank you for your Openne&s;s and Hone&s;ty on this Occa&s;ion, freely to declare the Truth. We wi&s;h our Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> naming the Governors of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania, Virginia, Caro|lina</HI> and <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> were &s;o hone&s;t and preci&s;e.</P>
<P>They have called us down to this Council Fire, which was kindled for Council Affairs, to renew Treaties of Friend&s;hip, and brighten the Chain of Friend&s;hip. But here we mu&s;t hear a Di&s;pute about Land, and our Time is taken up, but they don't come to the chief Point.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fir&s;t began to do Mi&s;chief; we told them &s;o. They only thanked us for our Openne&s;s and Advice, and &s;aid they would take Care for the future, but healed no Wounds. In &s;hort, when they &s;peak to us, they do it with a &s;horter Be&s;t or String than that which we &s;poke to them with; tho' they can make Wampum, and we cannot.</P>
<P>They ought not thus to treat with <HI>Indians</HI> on Council Affairs. Several of our &s;trong Belts are lo&s;t in their Hands entirely. I fear they only &s;peak from their Mouth, and not from their Heart.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame Day, <HI>P. M. Pi&s;quitomen</HI> and <HI>Thomas Hickman</HI> came to take their Leave of the Governor, accompanied with Captain <HI>Bull, William Hayes,</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac Stille,</HI> the Per&s;ons appointed to attend them to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> who were particularly recommended to their Care and Protection by a String of Wampum.</P>
<P>The Belts and Strings were numbered, as well in the written Paper containing the Me&s;|&s;ages, as on Labels tied to each of them, and delivered to <HI>Pi&s;quitomen,</HI> and the written Me&s;&s;age was delivered, with the Pa&s;&s;ports, to Captain <HI>Bull.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="008156_0026_102DD04980338380">The 22d of <HI>October,</HI> the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Chiefs held a private Council, and named two of their People to &s;end to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> viz. <HI>Tojenontawoby,</HI> a <HI>Cayuga</HI> Chief, and the younge&s;t <HI>Shick Calamy,</HI> who joined <HI>Pi&s;quitemen,</HI> and &s;et off this Afternoon.

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt, we heal your Wounds, we remove your Grief; we take the Hatchet out of your Heads; we make a deep Hole in the Earth, and bury the Hatchet &s;o low, that no Body &s;hall be able to dig it up again.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Now we have healed your Wounds, we, by this Belt, renew all our Treaties; we bright|en the Chain of Friend&s;hip; we return to our fir&s;t Affection; we confirm our ancient Union; we put fre&s;h Earth to the Roots of the Tree of Peace, that it may bear up again&s;t every Storm that can blow, and live and flouri&s;h to the End of Time, whil&s;t the Sun &s;hines, and the Rivers run.

<P><HI>A large Peace Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We now open a Road to the old Council Fire, which was kindled by your and our Fa|thers in the City of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>

<P>We thank you for the Care and Diligence with which you have attended to the &s;everal Matters recommended to you in the&s;e Conferences, which has yielded us Abundance of Satisfaction.</P>
<P>This Treaty will convince all our Enemies, that we are now united in the firme&s;t Band of Amity; and whil&s;t we join our Strength together, it will not be in their Power to hurt either you or us.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyu&s;cung,</P>
<P>By this Belt you put me in Mind, that we formerly referred our Di&s;pute about Lands to our Father King GEORGE, and you de&s;ired to know if he has decided it.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You &s;hould con&s;ider the Circum&s;tances of the Affairs of your Father King GEORGE; His Maje&s;ty lives at a very great Di&s;tance from us, is now engaged in a War with the <HI>French,</HI> and the Bu&s;ine&s;s of War takes up a great deal of Time and Attention; be&s;ides, in Time of War, we have but few Opportunities of hearing from him.</P>
<P>As yet I have had no An&s;wer relative to your Affairs. You may depend upon it, as &s;oon as I receive one, it &s;hall be communicated to you. And I can a&s;&s;ure you, the Proprietaries have pre&s;&s;ed Di&s;patch, and will do every Thing they can to bring it to a &s;peedy Determination.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Then Governor <HI>Bernard,</HI> reque&s;ting the Attention of the <HI>Indians,</HI> addre&s;&s;ed them as fol|lows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> United Nations,</P>
<P>By this String you &s;poke on Behalf of our Brethren the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> and &s;aid that they were wronged in their Lands; that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettled &s;o fa&s;t, that they were continually pu&s;hing them back; and when they a&s;ked for their Lands, they were told that they had &s;old their Lands, and had got drunk, and forgot it. If they had &s;wallowed their Lands, they mu&s;t be content, but they did not believe that they had &s;wallowed all, but that &s;ome was left. They de&s;ired that I would enquire after their Lands that were left, and do them Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am glad I have an Opportunity, in the Pre&s;ence of &s;o many Nations, to expre&s;s the De|&s;ire I have of doing Ju&s;tice to every one. The Throne of the Great King it founded on Ju&s;tice, and I &s;hould not be a faithful Servant to him, if I neglected to give Redre&s;s to all Per&s;ons that have received Injuries from the People over whom the Great King has placed me.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="008156_0028_102E3E8AAABF86F8">I have therefore had a Conference with the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of &s;ome of their Uncles, and have come to a full Agreement with them; the Proceedings of which are now ready to be read to you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have another Proof to give you of the Uprightne&s;s and Ju&s;tice of our Province. We have come to an Agreement with the <HI>Delaware Indians,</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> for the uncertain Claims they had on the Southern Parts of our Province; I hereby produce the Deeds that have been executed on this Occa&s;ion, that the Subject of them may be explained to you, and be had in perpetual Remembrance by all the Nations pre&s;ent; and I de&s;ire that you may all remember, that, by the&s;e two Agreements, the Province of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> is entirely freed and di&s;charged from all <HI>Indian</HI> Claims. In Confirmation of which I give you this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyu&s;cung,</P>
<P>By this String you tell me, that, after the killing the nine <HI>Indians</HI> near <HI>E&s;opus,</HI> you carried three Belts to <HI>George Freeland,</HI> who undertook to give them to the Governor, and you a&s;k what is become of tho&s;e Belts.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I can only &s;ay, that I never heard of tho&s;e Belts before; nor do I know what Governor <HI>George Freeland</HI> undertook to carry tho&s;e Belts to. The proper Governor was the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI>; for in his Province was this Mi&s;chief committed. And probably the Gover|nor of <HI>New-York</HI> had the&s;e Belts; for I have heard that he i&s;&s;ued a Proclamation for appre|hending the Perpretrators of this Fact. This Fact has been blamed by all good and wife Men; and I am glad it was not done by the People of my Province. I will acquaint the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> with what you have &s;aid upon this Occa&s;ion, and I will enquire after tho&s;e Belts, and give you an An&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>Governor <HI>Denny,</HI> being obliged to return to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> on urgent Bu&s;ine&s;s, took his Leave of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It gives me great Plea&s;ure that the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Treaty has been carried on with &s;o much Satisfaction.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry I am now to inform you, that I am obliged to leave you, having received la&s;t Night an Expre&s;s from General <HI>Forbes,</HI> who is now near the <HI>Ohio.</HI> My Bu&s;ine&s;s calls me to Town, I &s;hall therefore leave Mr. <HI>Logan</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> to tran&s;act the Remainder of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and doubt not but they will act to your Satisfaction.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you of my Affection for you, and wi&s;h you all Manner of Happine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> aro&s;e, and de&s;ired to be heard on Behalf of the <HI>Wapings,</HI> or <HI>Wapinger Indians,</HI> called the <HI>River Indians,</HI> living near <HI>E&s;opus,</HI> and produced a &s;hort broad Belt of white Wam|pum, having in the Center two Hearts, of a reddi&s;h Colour, and in Figures 1745, wrote after the following Manner, 17&hearts;&hearts;45. The Belt had a round Circle Pendant, repre&s;enting the Sun; he then produced two Certificates, one from Governor <HI>Clinton,</HI> and the other from Governor <HI>Hardy,</HI> both which were much in Favour of the <HI>Wapinger</HI> Tribe of <HI>Indians.</HI> He &s;aid the Belt was given them by the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and repre&s;ented their Union, which was to la&s;t as long as the Sun &s;hould continue in the Firmament.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> addre&s;&s;ed Governor <HI>Bernard,</HI> de&s;iring, by a String of Wampum, that he would extend his Protection to the Tribe of the <HI>Wapings</HI>; and as their Chief was old and infirm, he reque&s;ted the Favour of a Hor&s;e to carry him home, which was readily granted.</P>
<P><HI>Takeagh&s;ado,</HI> or <HI>Taga&s;hata,</HI> made the &s;ame Reque&s;t to Governor <HI>Denny,</HI> which was like|wi&s;e granted.</P>

<P>The <HI>Five Nation</HI> Chiefs having laid all the Belts and Strings on the Table, that were de|livered at this and the la&s;t Conference, the <HI>Cayuga</HI> Chief, <HI>Tokaaio,</HI> de&s;ired the Governors, and all pre&s;ent, would hearken to what <HI>Thomas King</HI> was going to &s;ay on Behalf of the <HI>United Nations</HI> (now Eight in Number) on which <HI>Thomas King</HI> aro&s;e, and taking up the fir&s;t Belt, which was given by <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> when he reque&s;ted a Deed for the <HI>Wyomink</HI> Lands, he ad|dre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Delawares, Teedyu&s;cung</HI> not being pre&s;ent, as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="008156_0031_102E3E913B02F2E8"><HI>Cou&s;ins,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> de&s;ired us to make you the Owners of the Lands at <HI>Wyomink, Shamokin,</HI> and other Places on the <HI>Sq&s;quehannah</HI> River; in An&s;wer to which, we who are pre&s;ent &s;ay, that we have no Power to convey Lands to any one; but we will take your Re|que&s;t to the great Council Fire, for their Sentiments, as we never convey or &s;ell any Lands, before it be agreed in the great Council of the <HI>United Nations.</HI> In the mean Time you may make u&s;e of tho&s;e Lands, in Conjunction with our People, and all the re&s;t of our Relations, the <HI>Indians</HI> of the different Nations in our Alliance, which being interpreted in <HI>Delaware,</HI> the String of Wampum was given to <HI>Mo&s;es Tittamy,</HI> and <HI>James Davis,</HI> to be delivered to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> as he was not pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Then taking up each Belt and String, in the Order it was delivered in this and the la&s;t Conference, he proceeded to repeat di&s;tinctly what had been &s;aid under each Article, return|ing Thanks for all tho&s;e good Speeches, which he &s;aid were extremely agreeable: He made particular Mention of the large Peace Belt, &s;aying, the Nations were va&s;tly plea&s;ed, that all the antient Treaties made here, at <HI>Albany,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, were renewed, as well as that the old Council Fire at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> was kindled again, and a good Road made to it, that might be travelled without any Danger; the&s;e in particular, as well as every other Matter tran&s;acted at the&s;e Conferences, we will make known to our own Nations, and to every other in Friend|&s;hip and Alliance with us; and we are &s;ure they will be very well received.</P>
<P>Then, addre&s;&s;ing Governor <HI>Bernard,</HI> they thanked him for his Farewel Speech, &s;aying, it was a very kind one, and that they were very glad at his having been pre&s;ent and given his A&s;&s;i&s;tance at this Treaty, which had given them an Opportunity of gaining an Acquaint|ance with him, which they would ever remember with Plea&s;ure. After a Pau&s;e, he de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed in mentioning &s;omething that had been omitted by the Governors and their Councils. You have forgot to bring with you Ammunition, of which we always u&s;ed to re|ceive a &s;ufficient Quantity, not only to &s;erve us in our Journey, but &s;upport us in our hunting Sea&s;on, that we might be enabled to make Provi&s;ion for our Families. You have given us Gun-Locks without Guns, which are of no Manner of U&s;e to us; and therefore this mu&s;t &s;urely have been forgot, as it is impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Guns, Powder and Lead, of which we have received none.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As many of us are old and infirm, we de&s;ire our Brethren will be &s;o good as to furni&s;h us with a Number of Waggons to carry &s;uch of us as are not able to walk with the Goods you have been plea&s;ed to give us, as far as <HI>Wyomink,</HI> where we have left our Canoes, and then we will di&s;charge the Waggons. We further de&s;ire a Supply of Provi&s;ions may be put into the Waggons, enough to &s;erve us till we get to our re&s;pective Habitations.</P>
<P>He then took up the Proprietary Relea&s;e, and returned Thanks for it. He &s;aid that, when the <HI>United Nations</HI> fir&s;t made the Reque&s;t to Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> to be tran&s;mitted to <HI>Onas,</HI> they had no Doubt but <HI>Onas</HI> would comply with it, having always found him ready to grant all their Reque&s;ts; with him we have never had any Difference, he has always &s;ettled our Affairs without giving us any Trouble, and to our Satisfaction. We heartily thank <HI>Onas.</HI> This Act confirms us in the good Opinion we have always had of him.</P>
<P>Then, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> with a String of Wampum, he &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P>This &s;erves to put <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> in Mind of his Promi&s;es to return the Pri&s;oners. Remem|ber Cou&s;in, you have made this Promi&s;e in our Pre&s;ence; you did it indeed before, and you ought to have performed it; it is a Shame for one who calls him&s;elf a great Man to tell Lies; let us, as Coun&s;ellors, perform our Engagements and Promi&s;es; Cou&s;in, you mu&s;t not now fail to perform your Word; we are all one People, and we mu&s;t all of us be punctual in the Performance of our Engagements. This was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, and the String was given to <HI>Mo&s;es Tittamy</HI> for <HI>Teedyu&s;cung.</HI> He then &s;aid the <HI>United Nations</HI> had fini&s;hed what they had to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Looking round the Room, he e&s;pied Mr. <HI>Vernon,</HI> the Per&s;on who had the Care of furni&s;h|ing the <HI>Indians</HI> with Provi&s;ions, and he de&s;ired, that, now Council Bu&s;ine&s;s was over, he might be ordered to take the Lock off the Rum, and let it run freely; that, as they were going away, their Hearts might me made glad, and we could very well &s;pare it, as it was of no U&s;e to us.</P>
<P>Some Wine and Punch was then ordered in, and the Conferences were concluded with great Joy and mutual Satisfaction.</P>
