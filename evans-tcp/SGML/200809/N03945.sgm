<HEAD>A &s;hort Word of Advice to all Chri&s;tians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Word of Advice to my own Heart and thine; thou profe&s;&s;eth Bapti&s;m, Church-fellow&s;hip; thou do&s;t well, they are glorious Ordinances: But if thou ha&s;t not the Blood of Chri&s;t at the Root of thy Profe&s;&s;ion, it will wither and prove but painted Pegeantry to go to Hell in.</P>
<P>If thou retain Guilt, Self-righteou&s;ne&s;s under it, tho&s;e Vipers will eat out all the Vitals of it at length. Try and examine with greate&s;t &s;trictne&s;s every day, what bottom thy Profe&s;&s;ion and Hope of Glory is build upon, whether it was laid by the Hand of Chri&s;t; if not, it will never be able to endure the &s;torm that mu&s;t come again&s;t it. Satan will throw it all down, &amp; great &s;hall be the Fall thereof, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.27.</P>
<P>Glorious Profe&s;&s;or, thou &s;halt be winnowed: Every Vein of thy Profe&s;&s;ion will be tried to pur|po&s;e: Terrible to have it all come tumbling down, and to find nothing but it to bottom upon.</P>
<P>Soaring Profe&s;&s;or, &s;ee to thy waxen Wings be|times, which will melt with the heat of Tempta|tions. What a Mi&s;ery to trade much and break at length, and have no Stock, no Foundation laid for Eternity, in thy Soul?</P>
<P>Gifted Profe&s;&s;or, look there be not a Worm at the Root that will &s;poil all thy fine Goard, &amp; make it die about thee in a day of &s;corchings. Look over thy &s;oul daily, and a&s;k, where is the Blood of Chri&s;t to be &s;een upon my &s;oul? What righteou&s;ne&s;s is it
<PB N="4" REF="004864_0003_100E06A0238BDA80">
that I &s;tand upon to be &s;aved by? Have I got off all my &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s? Many eminent Profe&s;&s;ors have come at length to cry out, in the &s;ights of the ru|in of all their duties, Undone, undone to all Eternity.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t &s;ins may be hid under the greate&s;t duties, and the greate&s;t terrors: &s;ee the Wound that &s;in hath made in thy &s;oul, be perfectly cured by the Blood of Chri&s;t, not &s;kinned over with duties, hum|blings, enlargements, &amp;c. Apply what thou wilt be&s;ides the Blood of Chri&s;t it will poi&s;on the &s;ore. Thou wilt find that &s;in was never mortified truly; that thou ha&s;t not &s;een Chri&s;t bearing it for thee upon the cro&s;s: nothing can kill it but the be|holdings of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Nature can afford no bal&s;am fit for &s;oul-cure. Healing from duty, and not from Chri&s;t, is the mo&s;t de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;e. Poor ragged nature, with all its highe&s;t improvements, can never &s;pin a garment fine enough (without &s;pot) large enough (without patches) to cover the &s;oul's nakedne&s;s. Nothing can fit the &s;oul for that u&s;e but Chri&s;t's perfect righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. Whatever is of nature's &s;pinning mu&s;t be all unravelled before the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t can be put on. What&s;oever is of nature's putting on, Satan will come and plunder every rag away and leave the &s;oul naked and open to the Wrath of God. All that nature can do will never make up the lea&s;t dram of grace that can mortify &s;in, or look Chri&s;t in the face one day.</P>
<P>Thou art a profe&s;&s;or, art baptized, goes on hear|ing, &amp; praying, and receiving, yet mi&s;erable may&s;t thou be. Look about thee, did&s;t thou ever yet &s;ee Chri&s;t to this day in di&s;tinction from all other excel|lencies

&amp; righteou&s;ne&s;s in the World, &amp; all of them falling before his Maje&s;ty and Grace, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 2.17.</P>
<P>If thou ha&s;t &s;een Chri&s;t truly, thou ha&s;t &s;een pure grace, pure righteou&s;ne&s;s in him, every way infinite, far exceeding all &s;in and mi&s;ery. If thou ha&s;t &s;een Chri&s;t thou can&s;t trample upon all the righteou&s;ne&s;s of men &amp; angels, &s;o as to bring thee into acceptati|on with God. If thou ha&s;t &s;een Chri&s;t, thou would&s;t not do a duty without him for ten thou&s;and Worlds, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.2. If ever thou did&s;t &s;ee Chri&s;t, thou did&s;t &s;ee him a Rock higher than &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;atan, &s;in, <HI>P&s;.</HI> 61.2. &amp; that Rock doth follow thee, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.4. And there will be continual drops of honey and grace out of that Rock to &s;atisfy thee, <HI>P&s;.</HI> 81.16. Examine if ever thou beheld Chri&s;t as the only be|gotten of the Father, full of grace &amp; truth, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.14, 16, 17. Be &s;ure thou art come to Chri&s;t, that thou &s;tand upon the Rock of Ages, ha&s;t an&s;wered his call to thy &s;oul, ha&s;t clo&s;ed with him for Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>Men talk bravely of believing (whil&s;t whole and &s;ound) few know it. Chri&s;t is the my&s;tery of the &s;cripture; grace the my&s;tery of Chri&s;t. Believing is the mo&s;t wonderful thing in the world. Put any thing of thine own to it, &amp; thou &s;poile&s;t it; Chri&s;t will not &s;o much as look at it for believing. When thou believe&s;t, and comes to Chri&s;t, thou mu&s;t leave behind thee thy own righteou&s;ne&s;s, bring nothing but thy &s;in. O that is hard, leave behind all thy ho|line&s;s, &s;anctifications, duties, humblings, &amp;c. &amp; bring nothing but thy wants and mi&s;eries, el&s;e Chri&s;t is not for thee, nor thou for Chri&s;t. Chri&s;t will be a pure Redeemer &amp; Mediator, and thou mu&s;t be a pure &s;in|ner, or Chri&s;t &amp; thou wilt never agree: It's the har|de&s;t

thing in the world to take Chri&s;t alone for righte|ou&s;ne&s;s; that is, to acknowlege him Chri&s;t: Join a|ny thing to him of thy own &amp; thou Un-chri&s;t's him.</P>
<P>Whatever comes in when thou goe&s;t to God for acceptation, (be&s;ides Chri&s;t) call it Antichri&s;t, bid it be gone; make only Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s trium|phant; all be&s;ides that is <HI>Babylon,</HI> which mu&s;t fall, if Chri&s;t &s;tand, and thou &s;halt rejoice in the fall thereof, <HI>I&s;.</HI> 1.10&mdash;12. Chri&s;t alone did tread the wine-pre&s;s, and there was none with him, <HI>I&s;.</HI> 63.3. If thou join to any thing but Chri&s;t, Chri&s;t will trample upon it in fury and anger, &amp; &s;tain his raiment with the blood thereof. Thou think'&s;t it ea&s;y to believe; was ever thy faith tried with an hour of Temptations, and a thorow &s;ight of &s;in? was it ever put to grap|ple with &s;atan, and the wrath of God lying upon the Con&s;cience: When thou wa&s;t in the mouth of hell and the grave, then did God &s;hew thee Chri&s;t a ran&s;om, a righteou&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c. Then could&s;t thou &s;ay, O I &s;ee grace enough in Chri&s;t; thou may'&s;t &s;ay that which is the bigge&s;t word in the world: Thou believe&s;t. Untried faith is uncertain faith.</P>
<P>To believing there mu&s;t be a clear conviction of &s;in, and of the merits of the blood of Chri&s;t, and of Chri&s;t's willingne&s;s to &s;ave upon this con&s;ideration meerly, that thou art a &s;inner; things all harder than to make a world. All the power in nature cannot get up &s;o high in a &s;torm of &s;in and guilt as really to believe there is any grace, any willingne&s;s in Chri&s;t to &s;ave. When &s;atan chargeth &s;in upon the con&s;cience, then the &s;oul to charge it upon Chri&s;t, that is go&s;pel-like, that is to make him Chri&s;t, he &s;erves for that u&s;e. To accept Chri&s;t's
<PB N="7" REF="004864_0004_100E06A253D37850">
righteou&s;ne&s;s alone, his blood alone for &s;alvation. That is the &s;um of the go&s;pel, when the &s;oul in all duties can &s;ay, nothing but Chri&s;t, Chri&s;t alone for righteou&s;ne&s;s, ju&s;tification, &s;anctification, re|demption, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. Not humblings, not du|ties, not graces, &amp;c. That &s;oul hath got above the reach of the billows.</P>
<P>For all temptations, &s;atan's advantages, our com|plainings are laid in &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s, &amp; &s;elf-excel|lency, God pur&s;ueth the&s;e, by &s;etting &s;atan upon thee, as <HI>Laban</HI> did <HI>Jacob</HI> for his Images which <HI>Rachel</HI> hid, <HI>Gen.</HI> 31. The&s;e mu&s;t be torn from thee, be as willing as thou wilt, the&s;e hinder Chri&s;t from coming in, and till Chri&s;t come in, guilt will not go out, and where guilt is, there is hardne&s;s of heart, and there|fore much guilt argues little, if any thing of Chri&s;t's blood, that will tend to hardening. Make Chri&s;t thy Peace, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.14. not thy duties, thy tears, &amp;c. Chri&s;t thy righteou&s;ne&s;s, not thy graces, &amp;c. Thou may&s;t de&s;troy Chri&s;t by duties, as well as by &s;ins. Look at Chri&s;t, and do as much as thou wilt. Stand with all thy weight upon Chri&s;t's righ|teou&s;ne&s;s; take heed of having one foot on thy own righteou&s;ne&s;s, another on Chri&s;t's. 'Till Chri&s;t come and &s;it on high upon a throne of grace, in the con&s;cience, there is nothing but guilt, terrors, &s;ecret &s;u&s;picions, the &s;oul hanging between hope and fear, which is an un-go&s;pel like &s;tate.</P>
<P>He that fears to &s;ee &s;in's utmo&s;t vilene&s;s, the ut|mo&s;t hell of his own heart, he &s;u&s;pects the merits of Chri&s;t. Be thou never &s;o great a &s;inner, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.1. try Chri&s;t to make him thy advocate, and thou &s;halt find him Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous. In all doubt|ings,
<PB N="8" REF="004864_0005_100E06A3D8750838">
fears, &s;torms of con&s;cience, look at Chri&s;t con|tinually. Do not argue it with &s;atan, (he de&s;ires no better) bid him go to Chri&s;t, and he will an&s;wer him, it is his office as he is our advocate, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.1. His office to an&s;wer the law as our &s;urety, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.22. His office to an&s;wer ju&s;tice, as our mediator, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.20. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.5. and he is &s;worn to that office, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.20. Put Chri&s;t upon it; if thou wilt do any thing thy &s;elf, as to &s;atisfaction for &s;in, thou renounceth Chri&s;t the righteous, who was made &s;in for thee, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.21.</P>
<P>Satan may alledge and corrupt &s;cripture, but he cannot an&s;wer &s;cripture. It's Chri&s;t's word of migh|ty authority, Chri&s;t foyled &s;atan with it, <HI>Mat.</HI> 4. In all the &s;cripture there is not an ill word again&s;t a poor &s;inner &s;tript of &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s; nay, it plentifully points out this man to be the &s;ubject of the grace of the go&s;pel, and none el&s;e. Believe but Chri&s;t's wil|lingne&s;s, and that will make thee willing. If thou finde&s;t thou can&s;t not believe, remember it's Chri&s;t's work to make thee believe; put him upon it, he works to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.13. Mourn for thy unbelief, which is a &s;etting up guilt in the con&s;cience above Chri&s;t, and underva|luing the merits of Chri&s;t, accounting his blood an unholy, a common, and un&s;atisfying thing.</P>
<P>Thou complaine&s;t much of thy &s;elf; doth thy &s;in make thee look more at Chri&s;t, le&s;s at &s;elf? That's right, el&s;e complaining is but hypocri&s;y. To be looking at duties, graces, enlargements, when thou &s;hould&s;t be looking at Chri&s;t; that's pitiful: Looking at them will but make thee proud, looking at Chri&s;t's grace will make thee humble. By grace you are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">d, <HI>Eph. v.</HI> 5. In all thy temptations be not di&s;|couraged,

<HI>Jam.</HI> 1.2. tho&s;e <HI>&s;urges</HI> may not be to break thee, but to heave thee off thy &s;elf on the Rock Chri&s;t</P>
<P>Thou may&s;t be bro't low, even to the brink of hell, ready to tumble in; thou can'&s;t not he bro't lower than to the belly of hell, many &s;aints have been there, even dowced in hell, yet there may'&s;t thou cry, there may'&s;t thou look toward the holy temple, <HI>Jonah</HI> 2.4. Into that temple none might enter but purified ones, and with an offering too, <HI>Acts</HI> 21.26. But now Chri&s;t is our temple &amp; &s;acri|fice, altar, high-prie&s;t, to whom none mu&s;t come but &s;inners, and that without any offering, but his own blood once offered, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.27. Remember all the patterns of grace that are in heaven. Thou thinke&s;t, O what a monument of grace would&s;t thou be: there are many thou&s;ands as rich monu|ments as thou be. The greate&s;t &s;inner did never oppo&s;e the grace of Chri&s;t, do not de&s;pair: Hope &s;till, when the cloud's at blacke&s;t, even then look towards Chri&s;t, the &s;tanding pillar or the Father's love and grace, &s;et up in heaven, for all &s;inners to gaze upon continually. What&s;oever &s;atan or con|&s;cience &s;ays, do not conclude again&s;t thy &s;elf. Chri&s;t &s;hall have the la&s;t word, he is the judge of quick and dead, and mu&s;t pronounce the final &s;entence, his blood &s;peaks reconciliation. <HI>Col.</HI> 1.20. clean&s;|ing, 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.7. purcha&s;e, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.28. redemp|tion, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.19. purging, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.13, 14. remi&s;|&s;ion, <HI>v.</HI> 20. liberty, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.10. ju&s;tification, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.9. highne&s;s to God. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.13.

He &s;peaks grace, mercy and peace, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.2. That's the language of the Father and of Chri&s;t. Wait for Chri&s;t's appearing, as the morning-&s;tar, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.19. He &s;hall come as certainly as the morning, as refre&s;hingly as the rain, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 6.3.</P>
<P>The &s;un may as well be hindered from ri&s;ing as Chri&s;t the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Mal.</HI> 4.2. Look not a moment off Chri&s;t. Look not upon &s;in; but look upon Chri&s;t fir&s;t: When thou mourne&s;t for &s;in, if thou do&s;t not &s;ee Chri&s;t, away with it, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. In every duty, look at Chri&s;t before duty, to pardon. In duty, to a&s;&s;i&s;t. After duty, to ac|cept; without this, it is but carnal carele&s;s duty. Do not legalize the Go&s;pel, as if part did remain to thee to do, and &s;uffer, and Chri&s;t were but an half Mediator; and thou mu&s;t bear part of thy own &s;in; make part &s;atisfaction. Let &s;in break thy heart, but not hope in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Look more at ju&s;tification than &s;anctification. In the highe&s;t commands con&s;ider Chri&s;t, not as an exacter to require, but a debter, an undertaker, to work. If thou ha&s;t looked at workings, duties, qualifications, and &s;uch like, more than at the me|rits of Chri&s;t, it will co&s;t thee dear; no wonder thou goe&s;t complaining. Graces may be evidences, the merits of Chri&s;t (only without them) mu&s;t be the foundation of thy hope to bottom on. Chri&s;t only can be the hope of glory, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.27.</P>
<P>When we come to God, we mu&s;t bring nothing but Chri&s;t with us. Any ingredients of our own qua|lifications, will poi&s;on and corrupt faith; he that builds upon duties, graces, and the like, knows not the merits of Chri&s;t. This makes believing &s;o hard,
<PB N="11" REF="004864_0006_100E06A5A881E368">
&s;o far above nature; if thou believe&s;t thou mu&s;t re|nounce (as dung and dro&s;s, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.7.8.) thy Privi|leges, thy obedience, thy bapti&s;m, thy &s;anctificati|on, thy duties, thy graces, thy tears, meltings, thy humblings, and nothing but Chri&s;t mu&s;t be held up: Every day thy workings, thy &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, mu&s;t be de&s;troyed. Thou mu&s;t take all out of God's hand, Chri&s;t he is the gift of God, <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.10. Faith the gift of God, <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> 3.8. Pardon a free gift, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.16. Ah how nature &s;torms, frets, rageth at this, that all is of gift and it can purcha&s;e nothing with its actings and tears, and duties, that all its workings are excluded, and of no value in heaven.</P>
<P>If nature had been to contrive the way of &s;alvati|on, it would rather have put it into the hands of &s;aints or angels to &s;ell it, than of Chri&s;t (who gives freely) whom therefore it &s;u&s;pects; it would have &s;et up a way to purcha&s;e by doing; therefore it obminates the merits of Chri&s;t as the mo&s;t de&s;truc|tive thing to it, would do any thing to be &s;aved, rather than go to Chri&s;t, or clo&s;e with Chri&s;t. Chri&s;t will have nothing, the &s;oul will force &s;ome|what of his own upon Chri&s;t. Here is the great controver&s;y. Con&s;ider, did&s;t thou ever &s;ee the merits of Chri&s;t, and the infinite &s;atisfaction made by his death? did thou &s;ee this in a time when the burthen of &s;in, and the wrath of God lay heavy upon thy con&s;cience. That is grace. The greatne&s;s of Chri&s;t's merits is not known, but to a poor &s;oul at the grea|te&s;t lo&s;s. Slight convictions, will but have &s;light low prizings of Chri&s;t's blood and merits.

The lea&s;t &s;ight of him will be &s;aving, the lea&s;t touch healing to thee, and God intends thou &s;hould&s;t look on him for he hath &s;et him upon a high throne of glory, in the open view of all poor &s;inners. Thou ha&s;t infinite rea&s;on to look on him, no rea&s;on at all to look off him. For he is meek and lowly of heart, <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.29.

It is not &s;o as thou imagin&s;t, that his &s;tate in glory, makes him neglectful, &s;cornful to poor &s;inners; no he hath the &s;ame heart now in heaven, he is God, and changeth not; He <HI>is the Lamb of God that taketh away the &s;ins of the world,</HI> John 1.29.

of nature, which &s;he pre&s;erves as her life; that makes Chri&s;t &s;uch an ugly thing to nature, nature cannot de&s;ire him; he is ju&s;t directly oppo&s;ite to all nature's glorious intere&s;ts. Let nature but make a go&s;pel, and it would make it contrary to Chri&s;t. It would be to the ju&s;t, the innocent, the holy, the righteous, &amp;c. Chri&s;t hath made a go&s;pel for thee, that is, to needy &s;inners, the ungodly, the unrighte|ous, the unju&s;t, the accur&s;ed. Nature cannot endure to think the go&s;pel is only for &s;inners, it will rather chu&s;e to de&s;pair, than to go to Chri&s;t upon &s;uch terms. When nature is but put to it by guilt or wrath, it will to its old haunts of &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;elf-goodne&s;s, &amp;c. And infinite power mu&s;t ca&s;t down tho&s;e &s;trong holds.

To &s;ay in complement, I am a &s;inner, is ea&s;y; but to pray with the publican indeed, Lord be merciful to me a &s;inner, is the har|de&s;t prayer in the world. It is ea&s;y to &s;ay, I believe in Chri&s;t; but to &s;ee Chri&s;t full of grace and truth, of who&s;e fulne&s;s thou maye&s;t receive grace for grace. That is &s;aving. It's ea&s;y to profe&s;s Chri&s;t with the mouth; but to confe&s;s him with the heart, as <HI>Peter (to be the Chri&s;t, the Son of the living God, the alone Mediator</HI>) that's above fle&s;h and blood. Many call Chri&s;t Saviour, few know him &s;o. To &s;ee grace and &s;alvation in Chri&s;t, is the greate&s;t &s;ight in the world; none can do that, but at the &s;ame time they &s;hall &s;ee that grace to be theirs.

A Chri&s;tle&s;s, formal profe&s;&s;ion will be the blacke&s;t &s;ight next to hell that can be. Thou may|e&s;t have many good things, and yet one thing be wanting, that may make thee go away &s;orrowful from Chri&s;t. Thou ha&s;t never &s;old all thou ha&s;t, never parted with all thine own righteou&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c. Thou maye&s;t be high in duty, yet a perfect enemy and advar&s;ary to Chri&s;t in every prayer, in every ordinance. Labour after &s;anctification to thy ut|mo&s;t, but make not a Chri&s;t of it to &s;ave thee; if &s;o, it mu&s;t come down one way or other.

<P>This will be &s;ound religion only, to bottom all upon the everla&s;ting mountains of God's love and grace in Chri&s;t, to live continually in the &s;ight of Chri&s;t's infinite righteou&s;ne&s;s and merits (they are &s;anctifying, without them the heart is carnal) and in tho&s;e &s;ights to &s;ee the full vilene&s;s, yet littlene&s;s of &s;in, and to &s;ee all pardoned; in tho&s;e &s;ights, to pray, hear, be baptized, &amp;c. Seeing thy polluted &s;elf, and all thy weak performances continually; in tho&s;e &s;ights to trample upon all thy &s;elf-glories, righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es, privileges as abominable, and be found continually in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t only, rejoycing in the ruins of all thy own righteou&s;ne&s;s, the &s;poiling of all thy own excellencies, that Chri&s;t alone, as mediator, may be exalted in his throne, mourning over all thy duties (how glorious &s;oever) that thou ha&s;t not

performed in the &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of Chri&s;t's love. Without the blood of Chri&s;t on the Con&s;ciences all are dead &s;ervices, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.14.</P>
<P>That opinion of Free-will &s;o cry'd up will be ea&s;i|ly confuted, as it is by the &s;cripture in thy heart who hath had any &s;piritual dealings with Chri&s;t, as to the application of his merits, and &s;ubjection to his righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. Chri&s;t is every way too magnificent a per&s;on for poor nature to clo&s;e withal or apprehend. Chri&s;t is &s;o infinitely holy, nature dur&s;t never look at him; &s;o infinitely good, nature can never believe him to be &s;uch, when it lies under full &s;ights of &s;in. Chri&s;t is too high and glorious for nature &s;o much as to touch. There mu&s;t be a divine love fir&s;t put into the &s;oul to make it lay hold on him, he lays &s;o in|finitely beyond the &s;ight or reach of nature.</P>
<P>That Chri&s;t that natural free-will can apprehend, is but a natural Chri&s;t of man's own making, not the Father's Chri&s;t, not Je&s;us the Son of the living God, to whom none can come without the Father's drawing, <HI>John</HI> 6.44, 46. Finally, Search the &s;crip|tures daily, as mines of Gold, wherein the heart of Chri&s;t is laid. Watch again&s;t con&s;titution &s;ins, &s;ee them in their vilene&s;s, and they will never break out into act. Keep always an humble, empty, bro|ken frame of heart; &s;en&s;ible of any &s;piritual mi&s;|carriage, ob&s;ervant of all inward workings, fit for the highe&s;t communications. Keep not guilt in the con&s;cience, but apply the blood of Chri&s;t imme|diately. God chargeth &s;in and guilt upon thee to make thee look to Chri&s;t the bra&s;en &s;erpent.</P>
<P>Judge not Chri&s;t's love by evidences, but by pro|mi&s;es. Ble&s;s God for &s;haking off fal&s;e foundations,
<PB N="17" REF="004864_0009_100E06AC91CAA060">
for any way whereby he keeps the &s;oul awakened, and looking after Chri&s;t: better &s;ickne&s;s, tempta|tions, than &s;ecurity and &s;lightne&s;s.</P>
<P>A &s;lighty &s;pirit will turn a prophane &s;pirit, and will &s;in and pray too. Slightine&s;s is the bane of pro|fe&s;&s;ion, if it be not rooted out of the heart, by con|&s;tant and &s;erious dealings with and beholding of Chri&s;t in duties, it will grow more &s;trong and more deadly, by being under Church Ordinances. Mea|&s;ure not thy graces by others attainments, but by Scripture-trials. Be &s;erious, exact in duty, having the weight of it upon the Heart; but be as much afraid of taking comfort from duties, as from &s;ins, comfort from any hand but Chri&s;t is deadly. Be much in prayer, or you will never keep up much communion with God. As you are in clo&s;et-prayer, &s;o you will be in all other Ordinances.</P>
<P>Reckon not duties by high Expre&s;&s;ion, but by low frames, and the beholdings of Chri&s;t. Tremble at duties and gifts. In was the &s;aying of a Saint, he was more afraid of his duties, than his &s;ins; the one often made him proud, the other always made him humble. Trea&s;ure up manife&s;tations, they make the heart low for Chri&s;t, too high for &s;in. Slight not the lowe&s;t, meane&s;t evidences of Grace. God may put thee to make u&s;e of the lowe&s;t, as thou thinke&s;t; even that, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.14. That may be worth a thou&s;and worlds to thee. Be true to truth, but not turbulent and &s;cornful. Re&s;tore &s;uch as are fallen. Help them up again with all the bowels of Chri&s;t. Set the broken dis-jointed bones with the grace of the Go&s;pel. High Profe&s;&s;ors, di&s;pi&s;e not weak Saints.

Abide in your call|ing, be dutiful to all relations, as to the Lord, be content with little of the world: little will &s;erve. Think every little of earth much, becau&s;e unwor|thy of the lea&s;t. Think much of heaven too little, becau&s;e Chri&s;t is &s;o rich and free. Think every one better than thy &s;elf, and carry ever &s;elf-loath|ing about thee, as one fit to be trampled upon by all the &s;aints. See the vanity of the world, and the con&s;umption that is upon all things, and love no|thing but Chri&s;t. Mourn to &s;ee &s;o little of Chri&s;t in the world, &s;o few needing him. Trifles plea&s;eth them better. To a &s;ecure &s;oul, Chri&s;t is but a fable, the Scriptures but a &s;tory. Mourn to think, how many under bapti&s;m, church-order, that are not under grace, looking much after duty, obedi|ence, little after Chri&s;t, little ver&s;ed in Grace. Pre|pare for the cro&s;s, welcome it, bear it triump|hantly like Chri&s;t's cro&s;s, whether &s;coffs, mockings, jeers, contempts, impri&s;onments, &amp;c.

Omitting little truths again&s;t light may breed hell in the con&s;cience, as well as omitting the greate&s;t Sin again&s;t light. If thou ha&s;t been taken out of the belly of hell, into Chri&s;t's bo&s;om, and made to &s;it among Princes in the hou&s;hold of God: O how &s;hould&s;t thou live as a pattern of Mercy; redeemed, re&s;tored &s;oul, what infinite &s;ums do&s;t thou owe Chri&s;t? with what &s;ingular frames mu&s;t thou walk
