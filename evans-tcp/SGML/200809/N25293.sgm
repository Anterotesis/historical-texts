<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>JUDGE M'KEAN, the Chief Ju&s;tice of Penn|&s;ylvania, in his charge to the Grand Jury (of which the reader will &s;ee enough by-and-by), ob&s;erved, that
<Q><HI>the liberty of the press</HI> was a phra&s;e much u&s;ed, but little under&s;tood.</Q>
This, in a <HI>public servant,</HI> as all the democratic officers call them&s;elves, is making pretty free with the un|der&s;tanding of the &s;overeign people, and of a people too whom the Congre&s;s have declared <HI>free</HI> and <HI>enlightened,</HI> and would have declared the "<HI>free-est</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>enlightened in the world,</HI>" had it not been for their de&s;ire
<Q>to avoid all <HI>cause of offence</HI></Q>
towards the <HI>free</HI> and <HI>enlightened</HI> French.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Cen&s;or</HI> for December, 1796, for a full account of this humiliating bu&s;ine&s;s.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Judge was certainly wrong. No people under&s;tand what the liberty of the pre&s;s means better than the Americans do. No one knows &s;o well how to appreciate the value of a thing, as he who has long enjoyed, and then lo&s;t it.
<PB N="6" REF="033523_0004_0FF771CE843A6D90">
Had the Judge called the liberty of the pre&s;s a thing much talked about, much boa&s;ted of, and <HI>very little enjoyed,</HI> I would mo&s;t readily have &s;ub|&s;cribed to his a&s;&s;ertion; for, of all the countries under the Sun, where <HI>unlicensed</HI> pre&s;&s;es are tol|erated, I am bold to declare, and the contents of this pamphlet will e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of my de|claration, that none ever enjoyed le&s;s <HI>real</HI> liber|ty of the pre&s;s than America has for &s;ome years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay, that this liberty has been abridg|ed by any po&s;itive law; on the contrary, I know well, that &s;everal of the State Con&s;titutions hold out a &s;omething (not very intelligible to be &s;ure) that would &s;eem to extend the liberty of printing beyond the limits pre&s;cribed by the Engli&s;h law. Nor do I pretend, that this dangerous abridgment of American freedom is to be attributed to tho change, which the revolution has produced in the name and nature of the government. I will not, for a moment, be &s;aid to in&s;inuate, that the pre&s;s is become not free, merely becau&s;e the go|vernment is become <HI>republican.</HI> No; I think, the people, when they adopted this form of go|vernment, expected, as they certainly <HI>were led to expect,</HI> an extention of this, and every other important branch of their liberties. What I contend for, is, that, &s;ome how or other, this liberty has been abridged; the exerci&s;e of it, ei|ther by popular prejudice, by the influence of party, the fear of mobi&s;h violence, or of govern|mental tyranny, has been, and yet is, mo&s;t &s;hame|fully and di&s;gracefully <HI>restrained.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="033523_0005_0FF771D2A69814C8">To enter into the cau&s;es, which have produc|ed this fatal effect, would be to revive the re|membrance of what I wi&s;h may ever remain buried in oblivion. I will therefore content my&s;elf with <HI>proving the fact;</HI> and to do this to the &s;atisfaction of every candid mind, I need go no farther back than my own times.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t came to Philadelphia, I was charmed with the literary liberty, which its inha|bitants &s;eemed to enjoy. I &s;aw pamphlets in every window, and news-papers in every hand. I was, indeed rather &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that tho&s;e pamphlets, and the&s;e news-papers were, &s;ome|thing like <HI>a certain Judge</HI> that I had heard of, <HI>all on one side:</HI> but, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, this mu&s;t be the fault of the authors and editors; and it leaves, the more room for &s;uch as have a mind to write on the other &s;ide. With this agreeable but delu&s;ive notion in my brain, I &s;at down con|tented under the calamity of reading daily, in common with my poor fellow citizens, about eighteen or twenty long columns of the vile&s;t and mo&s;t in&s;ipid tra&s;h that ever was &s;tamped up|on paper.</P>
<P>Long did I hope, and expect, to &s;ee &s;ome|thing like a manly and effectual oppo&s;ition to this flood of falshood and partiality; but I ho|ped and expected in vain. At la&s;t, it was <HI>my</HI> fate to enter the field. I had long felt a be|coming indignation at the atrocious &s;lander that was continually vomitted forth again&s;t Great Bri|tain; and the malignancy of Prie&s;tley and his addre&s;&s;ers at New-York brought it into action.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="033523_0006_0FF771D57AC067C0">The OBSERVATIONS on the emigration of this re&s;tle&s;s and ambitious demagogue contain, as I have el&s;ewhere remarked,
<Q>not one untruth, one anarchical, indecent, immoral, or irreligi|ous expre&s;&s;ion</Q>;
yet, when I came to offer it for the pre&s;s, the book&s;eller was afraid it was not <HI>popular enough.</HI> He was far, as he &s;aid, from di&s;approving of the work; but it was <HI>too much in favour of Great Britain,</HI> and on this account he thought it would endanger his <HI>windows,</HI> if not his <HI>person.</HI></P>
<P>This mans fears &s;eemed to me perfectly ab|&s;urd. The pamphlet &s;aid not a word in prai&s;e of Great Britain, generally. Indeed, policy had led me to &s;peak rather har&s;hly of that nation in one pa&s;&s;age or two; and &s;o evident was this, that the <HI>Briti&s;h Critics,</HI> though they pay the author compliments far beyond his merit, cannot for|bear to lament, they &s;ay, that &s;o enlightened a mind &s;hould &s;till harbour <HI>a rancour so implacable.</HI> The&s;e people, though certainly not le&s;s pene|trating than GOOSY TOM in the common affairs of literature, would have laughed at the idea of broken windows and ba&s;ted carca&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>However, notwith&s;tanding the ridicule, which this remark of the BRITISH CRITICS is calcu|lated to throw on the apprehen&s;ions of my book|&s;eller, now the <HI>worthy partner</HI> of LLOYD, &s;ub|&s;equent events have proved, that tho&s;e appre|hen&s;ions were not entirely groundle&s;s: for, al|though he did publi&s;h &s;everal &s;ucceeding pam|phlets from the &s;ame pen, without incurring a penalty of any kind, yet no &s;ooner was the <HI>real author</HI> known, than he began to &s;ee, and to feel
<PB N="9" REF="033523_0007_0FF771D824A18870">
too, that BRADFORD under&s;tood the <HI>American liberty of the press</HI> far better than he did.</P>
<P>During the publication of the re&s;t of the pam|phlets that i&s;&s;ued from BRADFORD's, I had of|ten to contend with his &s;cruples and his fears. In particular, I remember, that my calling the French mini&s;ter ADET, no <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> was very hard to be &s;urmounted. The French had open|ly and mo&s;t bla&s;phemously <HI>aboli&s;hed the Chri&s;tian religion</HI>; and the Convention, who had &s;ent out this emba&s;&s;ador, had even formally <HI>denied the being of a God</HI>; yet, &s;o high was this book&s;eller's notions of the <HI>liberty of the press,</HI> that he was afraid to publi&s;h a &s;entence, in which the French mini&s;ter was &s;aid <HI>not to be a Chri&s;tian</HI>! If as much had been &s;aid of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter, though fal&s;e, he would, I am pretty confident have had no &s;cruples at all.</P>
<P>It was no &s;ooner di&s;covered that I was PETER PORCUPINE, and that I had taken the excel|lent hou&s;e and &s;hop, that I now occupy, in or|der to carry on the printing and book&s;elling bu&s;ine&s;s, than the French faction began to mu&s;|ter their forces and put them&s;elves in battle array. Several infamous publications appeared in BACHE's paper, declaring me to be a <HI>deserter,</HI> a <HI>felon,</HI> a <HI>thief</HI> who had fled from the <HI>gallows,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Strong in my innocence I &s;teadily pur&s;ued my cour&s;e, and, thank God, my &s;teadine&s;s was at|tended with &s;ucce&s;s. Stung at the contempt with which I treated the&s;e abominable attempts on my character, another mode of injuring me

was fallen upon. A <HI>threatning letter</HI> was con|veyed under the door of my landlord, the ba&s;e object of which the letter it&s;elf will be&s;t explain. It is a performance that &s;hould ever find a place in a work that treats of the
<Q>unre&s;trained liberty of the pre&s;s.</Q>

<P>A certain William Cobbett, alias Peter Porcupine, I am informed is your te|nant. This daring &s;coundrel, not &s;atisfied with having repeatedly traduced the people of this country, vilified the mo&s;t eminent and patriotic characters among us <HI>and grossly abus|ed our allies the French,</HI> in his dete&s;table pro|ductions, has now the <HI>a&s;toni&s;hing effrontry</HI> to expo&s;e tho&s;e very publications at his win|dow for &s;ale, as well as certain prints indica|tive of the <HI>prowess of our enemies the British and the disgrace of the French.</HI> Calculating largely upon the moderation or rather pu&s;illa|nimity of our citizens, this puppy &s;uppo&s;es he may even in&s;ult us with impunity. But he will e'er long find him&s;elf dreadfully mi&s;taken. 'Tho' his mi&s;erable publications have not been hitherto con&s;idered worthy of notice, the late manife&s;tation of his impudence and enmity to this country will not be pa&s;&s;ed over. With a view therefore of preventing your feeling <HI>the blow</HI> de&s;igned for him, I now addre&s;s you. When the time of retribution arrives, it may not be convenient to di&s;criminate between the innocent and the guilty. Your property there|fore

may &s;uffer. For depend upon it brick walls will not &s;kreen the ra&s;cal from puni&s;h|ment <HI>when once the business is undertaken.</HI> As a friend therefore I advi&s;e you to &s;ave your property by either compelling Mr. Porcupine to <HI>leave your house</HI> or at all events oblige him <HI>to cease exposing his obominable productions</HI> or any of his <HI>courtly prints</HI> at his window for &s;ale. In this way only you may avoid danger to your hou&s;e and perhaps &s;ave the rotten car|ca&s;s of your tenant for the pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>It will be remembered, that I in&s;tantly pub|li&s;hed this letter, accompanied with comments, in which I &s;et the authors (for they were many) at defiance; but I did not mention then a cir|cum&s;tance that it is proper I &s;hould mention now. There was, on the morning in which I received the letter, one of the <HI>judges</HI> in my &s;hop. I &s;how|ed it him, and apprized him of my intention of publi&s;hing it in the manner I afterwards did; but he advi&s;ed me again&s;t it, for <HI>fear</HI> of <HI>the con|sequences.</HI> This proves his opinion with re&s;pect to the <HI>protection</HI> the liberty of the pre&s;s would receive in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>No violence, however, did &s;ucceed. But the election for members of Congre&s;s was approach|ing; and, as the <HI>free</HI> men would then be a&s;&s;em|bled, it was feared by my friends; indeed, it was generally under&s;tood, and publickly talked of, that, on the election night, <HI>my house was to be gutted.</HI> And, le&s;t the <HI>sons of liberty</HI> &s;hould

be uninformed of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and con&s;equent|ly unprepared for it, the &s;ame wretch BACHE (the Grand&s;on and pupil of Old Franklin) re|minded them of it by an inflammatory publica|tion &s;igned AN AMERICAN, which, after a &s;eries of the mo&s;t atrocious fal&s;hoods, concludes thus:
<LETTER>
<P>&mdash;while I am a friend to the <HI>unlimited</HI> free|dom of the pre&s;s, when exerci&s;ed by <HI>an Ame|rican,</HI> I am an implacable foe to its pro&s;tituti|on to a <HI>foreig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er,</HI> and would at any time a&s;&s;i&s;t in hunting out of &s;ociety, any meddling fo|reigner, who &s;hould dare to interfere in our politics.

<CLOSER><SIGNED>An American.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The American who can read this without blu&s;hing is an object of contempt, of &s;corn; a neutralized animal that has no idea of national honour, and that would &s;ell his country, were it in his power, for a &s;ingle Louis d'or. Yet &s;uch there are, and in abundance too.</P>
<P>A publication like this, the direct and avowed object of which was, to in&s;tigate the <HI>free</HI> men to deva&s;tation and <HI>murder,</HI> &s;hould, one would think, have been noticed by the magi&s;trates, par|ticularly under the eye of a <HI>Chief Ju&s;tice,</HI> whom we &s;hall by-and-by &s;ee &s;o zealous and &s;o watchful. But, no. It attracted the attention of no one, or at lea&s;t no one took any mea&s;ures
<PB N="13" REF="033523_0011_0FF771E336F81CF0">
to prevent the intended a&s;&s;ault. My hou&s;e and my family might have been burnt to a&s;hes; we might all have been dragged into the &s;treet and murdered, and, I &s;incerely believe, not &s;o much as a con&s;table would have held up his &s;taff to ar|re&s;t the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins We were, however, prepared for their reception. We &s;hould not have fallen unrevenged. Some of their &s;ouls would have taken their departure from my door-way on their journey to hell.</P>
<P>It is here that I ought, and that I do with plea&s;ure, acknowledge the genero&s;ity of &s;everal gentlemen of the city (many of whom I never &s;aw), who I was afterwards a&s;&s;ured, had formed the re&s;olution to &s;ummon the magi&s;trates, and to come to my aid in per&s;on. One gentleman in particular, whom I did not then know even by name, went in di&s;gui&s;e among the groups of <HI>free</HI> men to endeavour to find out their intention. I wi&s;h I <HI>durst</HI> name him now; but my <HI>gratitude</HI> to him forbids me to do it. When <HI>liberty</HI> comes to this pitch, I think it ought to a&s;&s;ume &s;ome other name.</P>
<P>But, what was the mo&s;t &s;hameful, and what is mo&s;t directly to the point before us, was, this au|dacious, this cut-throat attack on the liberty of the pre&s;s, was &s;uffered to pa&s;s unnoticed, not on|ly by all the other pre&s;&s;es in this city, but by all the pre&s;&s;es in the continent. There are, perhaps, two or three hundred news-papers publi&s;hed in the United States, and not one of them have ever whi&s;pered a word in condemnation of it, from that day to this.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="033523_0012_0FF771E65926A4F8">If, however, it was proper to de&s;troy me; if "<HI>Justice, honour,</HI> and <HI>national gratitude</HI>" de|manded my blood for exerci&s;ing the liberty of the pre&s;s, that &s;ame "<HI>Justice, honour</HI> and <HI>nation|al gratitude</HI>" did, it &s;eems, require my enemies to exerci&s;e that liberty in <HI>perfect safety.</HI> No le&s;s than &s;even pamphlets were, in this city, publi&s;h|ed again&s;t me in the &s;pace of ten days. It is a pity they cannot now be found above ground. Had they lived, they would have been a la&s;ting honour to the country that gave them birth, and particularly to the <HI>equal</HI> laws and <HI>impartial judi|ciary</HI> that tolerated them. They were, all toge|ther, a compo&s;ition of brutality, &s;lander, and vil|lainy of every &s;ort and de&s;cription, that would have di&s;graced hell it&s;elf. The anonymous &s;coundrels who wrote them vied with each other in ba&s;ene&s;s and atrocity; and one of them, who &s;eemed re&s;olved to have the pre-eminence in in|famy, and for whom everla&s;ting damnation is too mild a puni&s;hment, in&s;inuated <HI>that my wife was a whore!</HI>&mdash;And all this, only becau&s;e I had written with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t a nefarious French faction.

I could fill fifty volumes like this. The written threats, which I have now by me, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate or poi&s;on me, or fire my hou&s;e, amount to &s;ome hundreds.

<P>I &s;hould now enter into a recital of the per&s;e|cutions, of various &s;orts, which other printers, not devoted to the French, have experienced; but this would lead me too far.

<HEAD><HI>AMERICAN LIBERTY</HI> of the <HI>PRESS,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I undertook the publi&s;hing of a daily paper, it was with the intention of annihilating, if po&s;&s;ible, the intriguing, wicked, and indefati|gable faction, which the French had formed in this country. I was fully aware of the arduou&s;ne&s;s of the ta&s;k, and of the inconvenience and dan|ger to which it would expo&s;e both me and mine. I was prepared to meet the rancorous vengence of enemies in the hour of their triumph, and the coolne&s;s of friends in the hour of my peril: in &s;hort, to acquire riches &s;eemed to me quite uncertain, and to be &s;tripped of every farthing of my property &s;eemed extremely probable; but let what would happen, I was re&s;olved to pur|&s;ue the contemplated object, as long as there remained the mo&s;t di&s;tant probability of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="033523_0019_0FF771FF5DFD5E40">Among the dangers, which pre&s;ented them|&s;elves to me, tho&s;e to be apprehended from the &s;everity of the law appeared the mo&s;t formidable; more e&s;pecially as I happened to be &s;ituated <HI>in the State of Pennsylvania,</HI> where the government, generally &s;peaking, was in the hands of tho&s;e, who had (and &s;ometimes with great indecency) manife&s;ted an uniform partial|lity for the &s;ans-culotte French, and as unifom an oppo&s;ition to the mini&s;ters and mea&s;ures of the Federal Government. The&s;e per&s;ons I knew I had offended by the promulgation of di&s;agreeable truths; and, therefore, it was na|tural, that I &s;hould &s;eek for &s;ome &s;tandard as a &s;afe rule for my conduct with re&s;pect to <HI>the liber|ty of my press.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;et about the &s;tudy of the law of <HI>libels,</HI> to wade through fifty volumes of my&s;terious tauto|logy, was what I had neither time nor patience to do. The Engli&s;h pre&s;s was &s;aid to be <HI>ensla|ved</HI>; but, when I came to con&s;ult the practice of this en&s;laved pre&s;s, I found it &s;till to be far <HI>too free</HI> for me to attempt to follow its example. Finally, it appeared to me to be the &s;afe&s;t way, to form to my&s;elf &s;ome rule founded on the liber|ty exerci&s;ed by the <HI>American press.</HI> I conclud|ed, that I might, without danger, go as great lengths in attacking the enemies of the country as others went in attacking its friends: that as much zeal might be &s;hown in defending the Ge|neral Government and admini&s;tration as in ac|cu&s;ing and traducing them: and that as great warmth would be admi&s;&s;ible in the cau&s;e of virtue, order, and religion, as had long been tolerated in the wicked cau&s;e of villainy,

in&s;urrection, and bla&s;phemy. What ever ran|cour might be harboured again&s;t me in the brea&s;ts of particular per&s;ons, I depended on <HI>shame</HI> to re&s;train the arm of power: I thought no officer or officers of &s;tate, would, in this country, dare to deal towards an hone&s;t man with a rigour which had never been experienc|ed by the vile&s;t of mi&s;creants. Alas!
<Q>all this I thought, and all I thought was wrong;</Q>
as the following &s;heets will mo&s;t clearly evince.</P>
<P>Before I enter on the account of the ground|le&s;s pro&s;ecution which this Penn&s;ylvania &s;tate government has compelled me to &s;u&s;tain, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to notice &s;ome &s;teps that were taken by my enemies previou&s;ly thereto.</P>
<P>Some time in the month of Augu&s;t la&s;t, the Spani&s;h Mini&s;ter Don Carlos Martinez de'Yru|jo, applied to the Federal Government to pro|&s;ecute me for certain matters publi&s;hed in my Gazette, again&s;t him&s;elf and that poor unfortu|nate and humbled mortal, Charles the fourth, King of Spain. The government con&s;ented, and I was accordingly bound over, before the Honourble Judge Peters, to appear in the Fe|deral di&s;trict court, which will meet next April.</P>
<P>Of this preparatory &s;tep to <HI>a fair and imparti|al</HI> trial the Don was informed. But, it would &s;eem, the information was far from being &s;atis|factory to him; for, he delivered in a memori|al to the Federal Government, reque&s;ting (for what rea&s;on I leave the reader to determine) that the trial might come on before the Supreme Court of Penn&s;ylvania, of which court <HI>M'Kean is Chief Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="033523_0021_0FF7D494A531E190">Thus foiled in the grand object, a new &s;cru|tiny was, without much regard to decency, &s;et on foot; new pretended libels were hunted out; and, an application to pro&s;ecute me was made to the government of Penn&s;ylvania. It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that con&s;ent was &s;peedi|ly obtained.

<P>If I did not well know, that all in&s;truments of this kind, coming from under the hand and &s;eal of a <HI>Judge,</HI> are, by privilege immemorial, exempted from the la&s;h of critici&s;m, I &s;hould mo&s;t certainly be tempted to try my hand on the warrant.&mdash;For in&s;tance: the Commonwealth is called US, and this may be proper enough, as the Commonwealth, in the modern &s;tile, means the <HI>citizens thereof.</HI> But, what &s;hall we make of the pa&s;&s;age, where it is &s;aid, that I endeavoured to alienate the affections of the Spaniards from the citizens of the United States <HI>and of</HI> US; that is, from the citizens of the United States, <HI>and from the citizens of</HI> US; and this la&s;t &s;entence means, <HI>from the citizens of the citizens of the Commonwealth</HI>!

<P>But, let <HI>us</HI> return to more &s;olid matter.</P>
<P>The trifling circum&s;tances attending an arre&s;t and giving bail are &s;carcely worth relating; but, &s;ometimes, trifling circum&s;tances &s;erve to convey a more correct idea of the character of the par|ties concerned in a tran&s;action, and to guide the reader to a more ju&s;t appreciation of their mo|tives, than the longe&s;t and mo&s;t laboured gene|ral account of their conduct.</P>
<P>The Sheriff (who&s;e civility and candour I have every rea&s;on to applaud) came to my hou&s;e, for <HI>the first time,</HI> at twelve o'clock; and he was ordered to have me before the Judge <HI>at half past one.</HI> Thank God, I am not ver&s;ed in arre&s;ts; but, I believe, this is the fir&s;t time, that ever a man, pro&s;ecuted for a libel, was pinned down to the &s;hort &s;pace of <HI>an hour and a half</HI> to prepare for going out and to procure him&s;elf bail.

<P>I was not &s;o de&s;titute of friends as, perhaps, the Judge expected I was. Bail was pro|cured, and we were before him at the appointed time.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="033523_0024_0FF7D498A2CE7238">He a&s;ked us to &s;it down. I &s;eated my&s;elf on one &s;ide of the fire, and he on the other.

<P>THIS Bill of Indictment, however in&s;ignifi|cant it may be in it&s;elf, has already made con|&s;iderable noi&s;e in the world, and it will yet make a great deal more. Papers of this &s;ort generally travel from the court to the clerk's office; and there they lodge in eternal &s;leep. But this Bill is certainly de&s;tined to another fate. Neptune will lend his waves and Aeolus his winds to con|duct it over the deep. It will &s;ee climes that the inventors of it never &s;aw, nor ever will &s;ee. Little did they imagine, that they were becom|ing <HI>authors,</HI> and authors of &s;uch celebrity too, as, if it plea&s;e God, I will render them.</P>
<P>The identical copy of this precious document of liberty, which I received from the clerk's office, &s;tamped with the arms of poor Penn&s;yl|vania, I &s;hall &s;end to London by the next pack|et, addre&s;&s;ed to MR. REEVES'S loyal &s;ociety of the Crown and Anchor. When they are infe&s;t|ed with the <HI>reformists,</HI> or any other noi&s;y gang
<PB N="32" REF="033523_0029_0FF77217D33680B8">
of <HI>liberty men,</HI> they will have nothing to do but &s;how them this Bill, and &s;ay:
<Q>Here, you di&s;|contented dogs, is this what you are barking after? If it be, go to that <HI>free</HI> country, Ameri|ca.</Q>
I am much mi&s;taken if the bare &s;ight of it would not make more converts to their cau&s;e than all the means, that their talents and their laudable zeal have hitherto invented or employ|ed. It is a &s;ample of the liberty which the di&s;|affected in Britain are &s;ighing after; and they would exclaim with the old miller in the fable, "if &s;uch is the <HI>sample,</HI> what mu&s;t be the <HI>sack</HI>!"</P>
<P>The charges contained in the Bill of Indict|ment, lie buried in &s;uch a multitude of words which mean nothing, or at lea&s;t nothing to the purpo&s;e, that they are very difficult to be under|&s;tood. Some one &s;ays of a man extremely ver|bo&s;e in his conver&s;ation, that "his wit is like three grains of wheat in a bu&s;hel of chaff;" and exactly the &s;ame may with truth be &s;aid of the meaning of this Bill. The <HI>three libels,</HI> as they are called, may all be contained in a quarter of a page, whereas the Bill is &s;welled out to three or four pages. Let us, then, &s;ift out the <HI>three grains of wheat,</HI> leaving the chaff behind.</P>
<P>The be&s;t way of doing this, and of enabling the reader to form a correct judgment both as to their import and their tendency, will be to lay before him the three publications (in which they are to be found) entire and undi&s;torted, marking the pretended libellous parts in <HI>it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">licks.</HI></P>

Events are pointing, with the clearne&s;s of a &s;un-beam, to the ab&s;olute, irre&s;i&s;ta|ble nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a coalition. The ba&s;e &s;ub&s;idi&s;ed agents of France cannot long check the ju&s;t re&s;entment, or re&s;i&s;t the mea&s;ures of a high &s;pirited and free people, who &s;corned to receive the law from freemen, and will never &s;ub|mit to receive it from &s;laves.

France, which you now hug as an ally and equal, will corrupt your citizens, and &s;oment divi&s;ions among them; by which your go|vernment will be &s;o weakened that it will not dare to oppo&s;e her ambitions de&s;igns. She can never forget her being expelled from this country with di&s;|grace, nor will &s;he fail to improve the fir&s;t opportunity to recover &s;ome part of it.</Q>
&mdash;This is almo&s;t fulfilled in the pre&s;ent unfortunate &s;tate of things, but the ca&s;e is not without a remedy, if prompt deci&s;&s;ion and firmne&s;s is adopt|ed, on the part of government and its influential friends. To the&s;e the great body of the well-affected citizens look for an example. They feel the wounds of their country, they re&s;ent them, and if properly led would &s;peedily avenge them. They fear neither the foreign enemy, nor the da&s;tardly traitors among them&s;elves, but would rejoice in an opportunity of &s;acrificing to both their much injured and in&s;ulted country.&mdash;In what con&s;i&s;ts the principal &s;trength of France. It is in the poi&s;on of her principles among the mob, and corruption of her money among rebels and parricides. The&s;e have been the ba&s;e diabolical arts, by which &s;he has done as much as by her arms; and mi&s;erable has been the fate of all tho&s;e countries, where they have been not &s;ea&s;onably and vigor|ou&s;ly oppo&s;ed. If after &s;o many examples to teach us, we continue to fold our arms, and wrap our&s;elves up in an imagined &s;ecurity, our turn will come next: and we &s;hall add one more to the gloomy catalogue of the tributatries of France.&mdash; Therefore let the friends of their country and its government a&s;&s;o|ciate at this critical juncture, to &s;upport the con&s;tituted authorities, and to op|po&s;e their enemies by &s;pirited and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed efforts While traitors and foreign emi&s;&s;aries are daily in&s;ulting the chief magi&s;trate by virulent and inflamatory publications; when the mini&s;ters of France and Spain, forgetting common de|cency, obt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ude their appeals on the people, in order to mi&s;lead the ignorant; it is the duty of all tho&s;e who condemn &s;uch criminal conduct to declare their re&s;o|lution to oppo&s;e it.</P>

<P>The&s;e, reader, are the three publications, for which, under the <HI>free</HI> and <HI>equal</HI> government of Penn&s;ylvania.

<P>I would not in&s;ult the re&s;pectable gentlemen, who compo&s;ed the majority of the Grand Jury,

or the good &s;en&s;e of the reader, by any attempt of mine to prove that nothing contained in the&s;e publications is of a libellous nature. If the&s;e are libels, there is no book &s;acred or profane, which might not be con&s;trued into a libel. Every hi&s;tory contains libel upon libel again&s;t kings, queens and mini&s;ters. If the&s;e are libels, who is &s;afe? In &s;uch a &s;tate of things a man may draw down <HI>the punishment of a murderer</HI> on him&s;elf while he is &s;aying his prayers or &s;inging of p&s;alms.</P>
<P>Of the three publications, the two fir&s;t only <HI>originated</HI> in my Gazette: the other was taken from the <HI>Gazette of the United States,</HI> publi&s;hed by Mr. Fenno. Of this latter circum&s;tance I &s;hall &s;peak more fully, when I come to the Chief Judge's charge.</P>
<P>The two publications, which made their fir&s;t appearance through my means, I have not the honour to be the writer of. They were both written by gentlemen of this city; <HI>native</HI> Ame|ricans, men who were determined <HI>whigs</HI> during the war for independence, republicans in prin|ciple, and firmly attached to the pre&s;ent go|vernment.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t of the&s;e two publications, though there is certainly nothing libellous, I am ready to confe&s;s there is a great deal of <HI>warmth;</HI> and if the admi&s;&s;ion of an e&s;&s;ay extraordinarily warm, abounding in &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;entment and indignation, were ever ju&s;tifiable, they mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly were on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. The commu|nication
<PB N="38" REF="033523_0035_0FF772278553D0B8">
of the OLD SOLDIER was &s;ent me at a mo|ment, when the city of Philadelphia, ju&s;t quiet|ed after the <HI>appeal</HI> of the French Mini&s;ter Adet,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Cen&s;or for November, 1796</NOTE> rang with the daring, the degrading, the con|temptuous in&s;ult, which the Spaniard Yrujo had offered to the government of America and to every individual living under it.</P>
<P>He had publi&s;hed a mo&s;t audacious letter to Mr. Pickering, the Secretary of State, contain|ing a &s;ummary of all that is in&s;olent. This let|ter had been handed and hawked about the city; and had, by his &s;ecretary, been &s;ent to every public print for in&s;ertion. It was gone forth to the univer&s;e; and, that it tended to de|grade and defame America, we need no other proof than the following paragraph from the London Gazette of the 14th of September.&mdash;
<Q>The Americans are, according to our la&s;t ad|vices from New-York, paying dear for their <HI>independence.</HI> The French take all their ve&s;|&s;els, block up their very rivers, puni&s;h their &s;eamen like malefactors, and actually make them pay for the &s;hot they fire at them; while the Spani&s;h Mini&s;ter, with impunity, in&s;ults and braves their poor enfeebled government. He has written to Timothy Pickering, E&s;q. their fir&s;t Secretary of State (&s;ee our Gazette of ye&s;terday) in a language that Buonaparte would not venture to a&s;&s;ume to his Ci&s;alpinc convention, or citizen Noel to the fallen and degraded Dutch: and what very much aggra|vates the in&s;ult, he has, without, permi&s;&s;ion from the Pre&s;ident of the general Congre&s;s,
<PB N="39" REF="033523_0036_0FF77229074FBFF8">
communicated this letter to the people, as a &s;ort of manife&s;to, or appeal, to them from their government. Nothing of this kind, we believe, ever before pa&s;&s;ed <HI>unresented,</HI> except in a conquered or invaded country; and we cannot help lamenting, that &s;o very little &s;pi|rit &s;hould be found in any people, but particu|larly in a people, who boa&s;t their origin from Britons.</Q></P>
<P>This paragraph, or at lea&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance of it, I have &s;een in three London papers and in one Dublin paper; &s;o that, it may be fairly con|cluded, its currency is by this time general, not only in the Briti&s;h dominions, but all over Eu|rope.&mdash;And, I pray, was no one to attempt to wipe away the &s;tigma? Though the public pa|pers had been made &s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;preading of this deep &s;hame and di&s;grace abroad, was no printer to admit any thing that &s;erved to mark the &s;trong indignation it in&s;pired at home? Was the pre&s;s to be free for the Spaniard alone? Was he to be allowed to taunt and threaten and de&s;pi&s;e; and were the poor Americans to &s;ew up their lips, or only mutter their impotent an|ger in &s;ecret? If this be &s;o; if no man, by a&s;|&s;uming a bold, an indignant, and retaliating tone, was to make an effort to re&s;cue his coun|try and him&s;elf from di&s;honour, without being harra&s;&s;ed with a pro&s;ecution, without hazarding <HI>the punishment of a murderer,</HI> ours is a fallen &s;tate indeed! If this be liberty and independence, or whatever el&s;e it may be called, God grant me the enjoyment of its oppo&s;ite.

<P>I &s;hall now come to Judge M'Kean's Charge to the Grand Jury; and &s;hall, without going out of court, take upon me to decide on its merits.</P>
<P>It was a charming thing this, for me to get hold of. I had long wi&s;hed to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome &s;uch proof, &s;ome &s;uch convincing proof, of the <HI>superiority</HI> of the American liberty of the pre&s;s over that enjoyed in the "<HI>Insular Bastile,</HI>" Great Britain; and it is to the de&s;ire that I have of giving it a portable and durable &s;ituation, and to that alone, that this pamphlet is to be attribu|ted: for which kind intention I humbly hope his <HI>Honour</HI> will feel inclined to pardon my pa&s;t mi&s;doings. His pretty <HI>works</HI> will now be read with admiration, in countries where, I am &s;ure, had it not been for me, his name would never have once been articulated.</P>
<P>When this Charge, garni&s;hed with my &s;im|ple and good-natured comments, comes to be &s;erved up in Britain, it will be a di&s;h for a king. The royali&s;ts will lick their lips, and the republi|cans will cry, God ble&s;s us! The emigration for <HI>li|berty's sake</HI> will cea&s;e, and we &s;hall have nothing but the pure unadulterated dregs of Newgate and the Fleet; the candidates for Tyburn and Bo|tany Bay. Ble&s;&s;ed cargo! All <HI>patriots</HI> to the back-bone: true philanthropi&s;ts and univer&s;al citizens; fit for any place but England in this world, and for heaven in the next.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="033523_0038_0FF77236317F3FD8">The famous charge, which is to produce the&s;e excellent effects, was delivered to the Grand Ju|ry at the Court of Oyer and Terminer, above|mentioned in the Bill of Indictment. I &s;hall not fill up my pages in copying the former part of it, which the reader will, I am per&s;uaded, readily excu&s;e when he has read the latter. Like two uncouth boori&s;h vi&s;itants, the pre&s;ence of the one renders all apology unnece&s;&s;ary for the ab&s;ence of the other.</P>
<P>The Judge began, as, I believe, is u&s;ual, with a definition of the &s;everal crimes, which general|ly fall under the cognizance of &s;uch a court: as, trea&s;on, &s;odomy, rape, forgery, murder, &amp;c. &amp;c. But the&s;e his <HI>Honour</HI> touched &s;lightly upon. He bru&s;hed them over as light and trifling of|fences; or rather he blew them a&s;ide as the chaff of the criminal code, in order to come at the more &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial &s;in of LIBELLING.</P>
<P>The weight, or rather the mea&s;ure, that his Honour gave to this crime above all others, on this particular occa&s;ion, I &s;hall prove&mdash;not by ratiocination, but by arithmetic; by mea&s;ure|ment with the aid of a Carpenter's two-foot rule; as thus:</P>
<P>The Charge contains &s;eparate definitions of 32 crimes, the whole of which, in the columns of the Gazette, occupy 5 F. 8 Inches, running mea&s;ure; of which that of LIBELLING alone oc|cupies 3 F. 1 In. 6 P. On the&s;e dimen&s;ions I &s;tate the following</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="033523_0039_0FF77237B316FEA8">
<LABEL>PROBLEM.</LABEL>
If 32 Crimes occupy 5 F. 8 In. and 1 crime occupies 3 F. 1 In. 6 P. of how much greater magnitude ought this 1 crime to be than any 1 of the remaining 31.</P>
<P><LABEL>SOLUTION&mdash;18 <HI>Times.</HI></LABEL>
Thus, then, if we are to judge from the di|men&s;ions of the Chief Ju&s;tice of Penn&s;ylvania's charge, <HI>Libelling</HI> is eighteen times wor&s;e, more dangerous and more heinous, than robbery, forgery, trea&s;on, &s;odomy, or murder!</P>
<P>The fact is, the Charge &s;eemed &s;tudied to ex|cite a horror of no crime but that of libelling; the court &s;eemed met for the puni&s;hment of no|thing el&s;e, and I &s;eemed to be the &s;ole object of that puni&s;hment. Of this the reader will be con|vinced by a peru&s;al of the Charge it&s;elf; and <HI>the cause</HI> he will find explained in the &s;ub&s;equent remarks.</P>
<P><LABEL>CHARGE.</LABEL> 
The Chief Judge (M'KEAN), after having, as was before ob&s;erved, ju&s;t touched on the nature and puni&s;hment of other crimes, proceeds, with re&s;pect to LIBELS, thus:</P>
<Q><P>Before I conclude, <HI>I am &s;orry</HI> to have occa&s;ion to mention, that there is ano|ther crime, that peculiarly concerns the judges of the &s;upreme come to endea|vour to correct, it is that of LIBELLING. I will de&s;cribe it at large.</P>
<P>Libels or libelli famo&s;i, taken in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, &s;ignify any writings, pictures, or the like, of an <HI>immoral</HI> or illegal tendency; but in the &s;en&s;e we are now to con&s;ider them, are malicious defamations of any per&s;on, and e&s;pecially of a magi&s;trate, made public either by writing, printing, &s;igns or pictures, in order to provoke him to wrath, or to expo&s;e him to public hatred, contempt or ridicule.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="033523_0040_0FF7723ACB2EE270">The direct tendency of the&s;e libels is the breach of the public peace, by &s;tirring up the objects of them, their families and friends to acts of revenge, and perhaps of blood&s;hed; which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train by the &s;e|vere&s;t laws, were there no redre&s;s from public ju&s;tice for injuries of this kind, which, of all others, are mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt; and which, being entered upon with coolne&s;s and deliberation receive a greater aggravation than any other &s;candal or defamation, continue longer, and are propagated wider and farther. <HI>And where libels are printed again&s;t per&s;ons employed in a public capacity, they receive an aggravation, as they tend to &s;candalize the government,</HI> by reflecting on tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of public affairs, and thereby not only endanger the public peace, as all others do, by &s;tirring up the parties immediately concerned to acts of revenge, but have al&s;o a direct tendency to breed in the people a di&s;like of their governors, and incline them to faction and &s;edition.</P>
<P>Not only charges of a heinous nature, and which reflect a moral turpitude on the party, are libellous, but al&s;o &s;uch as &s;et him in <HI>a &s;currilous ignominious light:</HI> For every per&s;on <HI>de&s;ires to appear agreeable in life,</HI> and mu&s;t be highly provoked by &s;uch ridiculous repre&s;entations of him, as tend to le&s;&s;en him in the e&s;teem of the world, and take away his reputation, which to &s;ome men is more dear than life it&s;elf, for the&s;e equally create ill-blood, and provoke the parties to acts of revenge, and breaches of the peace.</P>
<P>A defamatory writing expre&s;&s;ing <HI>only one or two letters of a name,</HI> or u&s;ing <HI>&s;uch de&s;criptions and circum&s;tances, feigned names</HI> or <HI>circum&s;tances,</HI> in &s;uch a manner, that <HI>from what goes before,</HI> and <HI>follows after,</HI> it mu&s;t needs be <HI>under|&s;tood</HI> to &s;ignify &s;uch a per&s;on in the plain, obvious and natural <HI>con&s;truction</HI> of the whole, is as properly a libel, as if it had expre&s;&s;ed the whole name at large: for it brings the utmo&s;t contempt upon the law, to &s;uffer it's ju&s;tice to be eluded by &s;uch trifling eva&s;ions; and it is a ridiculous ab&s;urdity to &s;ay, that a writing, which is under&s;tood by every the meane&s;t capacity, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be under|&s;tood by the courts and juries.</P>
<P>It is equally ridiculous and ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that if a man &s;peaks &s;landerous or defamatory words of another, he may be &s;uch, and ample damages recovered for the injury, but if the &s;ame words are put in writing or printed, no puni&s;hment can be inflicted. Such a doctrine may gratify the wi&s;hes of envious and <HI>mali|cious cowards and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins,</HI> but mu&s;t be dete&s;ted by all &s;en&s;ible and good men.</P>
<P>The&s;e offences are puni&s;hable either by indictment, information or civil ac|tion: But there are &s;ome in&s;tances where they can be puni&s;hed by a criminal pro&s;ecution only; as where the United States in congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, the legi&s;la|ture, judges of the &s;upreme court, or civil magi&s;trates in general are charged with corruption, moral turpitude, ba&s;e partiality, and the like, when no one in particular is named.</P>

<P>So pointed, &s;o per&s;onal a charge, I am bold to &s;ay, was never before delivered from the Bench in any country, that has the lea&s;t pre|ten&s;ions to civil liberty. If it be fore&s;een, that a particular ca&s;e, rather novel, is to come before a Grand Jury, it is the cu&s;tom for Judges, as it certainly is their duty, to explain its nature, its tendency, and the law re&s;pecting it fully and minutely; but never, till the 27th day of la&s;t No|vember, did a Judge, pre&s;iding to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice according to the mild and impartial pre|cepts of the Common Law of England, &s;o far forget the genuine &s;pirit of that law as to point directly at a &s;ingle offender, and to employ all the per&s;ua&s;ion in his power to bring down cha&s;|ti&s;ement on his head.</P>
<P>The Charge contains every thing calculated to awaken the apprehen&s;ions of the Grand Jury as to the effects of my conduct, and to prepo&s;|&s;e&s;s their minds again&s;t my per&s;on. In every thing but elegance and animation, it was more like the zealous and impa&s;&s;ioned pleadings of an advocate, than the calm, dignified, and im|partial
<PB N="47" REF="033523_0044_0FF7724426801058">
accents that ever &s;hould breathe in the language from the Bench.</P>
<P>And, what was there, I pray, either in my character, in the particular ca&s;e before the Grand Jury, or in the general tenor of my pub|lications, to warrant this odious departure from the excellent rules, which had their origin in de|cency and candour, and which have been ren|dered &s;acred by the practice of our fore-fathers? A &s;tranger, had there been one in court, would naturally have concluded me to be a notorious defamer of innocence, a &s;editious and turbulent troubler of the government, a &s;worn enemy of morality and religion; in three words, a profli|gate, a rebel, and a bla&s;phemer.</P>
<P>It hardly ever becomes a man to &s;ay much of his private character and concerns; but, on this occa&s;ion, I tru&s;t I &s;hall be indulged for a mo|ment. I will &s;ay, and I will make that &s;aying good again&s;t whoever &s;hall oppo&s;e it, that I have never attacked any one, who&s;e private charac|ter is not, in every light which it can po&s;&s;ibly be viewed, as far beneath mine as infamy is be|neath honour.&mdash;Nay; I defy the city of Phila|delphia, populous as it is, and re&s;pectable as are its inhabitants in general, to produce me a &s;in|gle man, who is more &s;ober, indu&s;trious or ho|ne&s;t; who is a kinder hu&s;band, a tenderer father, a better ma&s;ter, a &s;ounder friend, or (though la&s;t not lea&s;t) a more zealous and faithful &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t certainly it is un&s;eemly in any one to &s;ay thus much of him&s;elf, unle&s;s compelledt it by &s;ome public outrage on his character; but,

when the accu&s;ation is thus made notorious, &s;o ought the defence.

<P>As to my writings; I never did &s;lander any one, if the promulgation of u&s;eful truths be not &s;lander. Innocence and virtue I have often en|deavoured to defend, but I never defamed ei|ther.

But, the&s;e are not the days for gen|tlene&s;s and mercy. Such as is the temper of the foe, &s;uch mu&s;t be that of his opponent.

would puzzel the devil him&s;elf to produce, from my writings, a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age, which could, by all the powers of perver&s;ion, be twi&s;ted into an attack on it.

<P>In the Summer of 1796, a work was publi&s;h|ed by one STEPHENS (an Iri&s;h Patriot, who has &s;ince &s;punged his creditors), entitled: "<HI>Chris|tianity contrasted with Deism</HI>:" And, by a ma&s;|ter-piece of ba&s;ene&s;s, before unheard of among the mo&s;t infamous of &s;cribblers, my a&s;&s;umed name, PETER PORCUPINE, was in&s;erted in the title page, in order to give currency to the per|nicious production.</P>
<P>This pamphlet abounded with the mo&s;t daring impiety; and, though I will not take upon me to &s;ay that the Chief Ju&s;tice ever <HI>saw</HI> it, he mu&s;t have heard of its exi&s;tence; for it was not only adverti&s;ed for &s;ale but there were al&s;o a con&s;ider|able number of paragraphs re&s;pecting it, both in BACHE's and MR.

<P>All the&s;e publications, and many more that might be mentioned, have been, and yet are, pub|li&s;hed in Penn&s;ylvania.

<P>I have the &s;ame opinion of the Judge's law knowledge that mo&s;t people have; but he mu&s;t certainly know, that <HI>Christianity</HI> is part of <HI>the law of the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd</HI>; that to deride and bla&s;pheme it is puni&s;hable by the common law; and that it is the duty of all magi&s;trates, more particularly Judges, to make the law, in this re&s;pect known, and to &s;ee it executed.</P>

people have forgotten, that, in 1795, a Sermon on National Gratitude was preached in this city, by a leraned Divine, then at the head of Princeton College. In the cour&s;e of this much admired &s;ermon, the preacher took occa&s;i|on to cen&s;ure the <HI>Age of Reason</HI>; and this it was that brought on him, from our <HI>decent</HI> writer, the following attack:

How came it not to attract the attention of the Supreme Court of Penn&s;ylvania, who&s;e
<Q>peculiar duty it is to repre&s;s and correct &s;uch exce&s;&s;es?</Q>
&mdash;The book was publi&s;hed in all the news-papers; it was &s;old by all the book&s;el|lers <HI>except me</HI>; it was even hawked about the &s;treets, and was the &s;ubject of univer&s;al cen&s;ure and abhorrence; and yet the Supreme Court never did cen&s;ure it; nor did the Chief Ju&s;tice ever feel him&s;elf
<Q>impre&s;&s;ed with the duties of his &s;tation</Q>
to <HI>bind the author or publi&s;her over</HI>!</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="033523_0054_0FF7717A6ED17D28">The author was known to a <HI>certain Secretary</HI>; was even his intimate acquaintance and compa|nion; and his pamphlet abounds with invec|tives <HI>against Great Britain,</HI> and high &s;ounding <HI>compliments to France.</HI> His politics, I &s;uppo&s;e, he had the prudence to intend as a &s;ort of atone|ment for his offences.</P>
<P>From the <HI>staining of families</HI> let us turn to the attacks of men in their public capacities.</P>
<P>The Chief Ju&s;tice tells us, that, when defa|matory writings are publi&s;hed
<Q>again&s;t per&s;ons in a <HI>public capacity,</HI> they receive an <HI>aggrava|tion,</HI> as they tend to &s;candalzie the govern|ment, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>This doctrine, by-the-bye, I believe few men, except tho&s;e in a public capacity will reli&s;h. It is exactly contrary to the &s;pirit, as well as the letter, of the little pamphlet, entitled, "The Con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania."&mdash;In that ine&s;ti|mable performance, there is one Chapter con|taining a li&s;t of what are there called "the e&s;|&s;ential principles of liberty," which are po&s;itive|ly declared to be excepted out of the general powers of government, and fixed on for ever to remain inviolate.&mdash;Among the precious things thus carefully pre&s;erved, is, <HI>the liberty of the press</HI>; and it is &s;aid, that no law &s;hall be made to re&s;train any per&s;on,
<Q>who undertakes to ex|amine the proceedings of the legi&s;lature <HI>or any branch of government.</HI></Q>
And again it &s;ays, that,
<Q>in pro&s;ecutions for the publication
<PB N="58" REF="033523_0055_0FF771804D34F758">
of any papers, inve&s;tigating the official con|duct of officers, or <HI>men in a public capacity,</HI> the truth thereof may be given in evidence.</Q></P>
<P>Thus, you &s;ee, this pamphlet of Penn&s;ylvania holds out to the world, that men in a public ca|pacity are more open to the cen&s;ure of the pre&s;s than the &s;overeign citizens are, which is, indeed, no more than rea&s;onable; but this Judge, this <HI>learned</HI> expo&s;itor of the law and con&s;titution, tells us, that cen&s;orious writings receive an <HI>ag|gravation,</HI> when written again&s;t per&s;ons in a <HI>public capacity</HI>!</P>
<P>However, be it &s;o. Let us prefer the Judge's a&s;&s;ertion to the declaration of the &s;overeign people of Penn&s;ylvania. Let us, for a moment, look upon their con&s;titution as merely intended to amu&s;e them and the world; and then let us &s;ee what this State Government, and this &s;ame Judge, have permitted to pa&s;s unreproved and unnoticed, in writers inimical to the Federal Government, and notoriou&s;ly in the pay of France.</P>
<P>I could here produce volumes of the mo&s;t attrocious calumny again&s;t the Federal Govern|ment and its officers individually; but, be&s;ides my want of room, I am prevented by the noto|riety of the fact. Every one in America knows what I have here generally &s;tated, to be true; and it is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to introduce only a few in&s;tances for the information of foreigners.</P>
<P>BACHE, in his paper, No. 1037, after load|ing the Executive of the United States with va|rious

fal&s;e and infamous charges, &s;ays:

<P>This is pretty well for the Executive. Now let us hear what CALLENDER (in his

&s;ays of the Congre&s;s in a lump&mdash;"If a man," &s;ays he,
<Q>was to be kept a twelve month in irons, and then to be hanged for &s;tealing <HI>one</HI> hor&s;e, what ought to be done with the Congre&s;s and their agents, who <HI>forcibly pilfered</HI> &s;o many that are yet un|paid for?</Q>
&mdash;I mu&s;t leave JUDGE M'KEAN to an&s;wer this que&s;tion; for he was, I believe, one of the Congre&s;s that Callender alludes to. However, le&s;t any offender &s;hould &s;lip him, the <HI>Historian</HI> takes care to include in his cen&s;ure, the &s;econd, the third, and the fourth Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>From the Government in general we will now come to particular members of it.&mdash;The Judge tells us, if publications,
<Q>containing per|&s;onal invectives, low &s;currillity, and &s;lande|rous charges, were to e&s;cape with impunity, the <HI>fairest</HI> and <HI>best characters,</HI> that this or any other country ever produced, would be vilifi|ed and bla&s;ted, if not ruined.</Q></P>
<P>Now then, let us hear BACHE again; the mouth-piece of the French faction, and fre|quently the companion of the Chief Ju&s;tice at Civic Fe&s;tivals.&mdash;This atrocious wretch, in his paper of the 9th of July, 1795, has the follow|ing paragraph:&mdash;"The day" [the 4th of July]
<Q><PB N="60" REF="033523_0057_0FF77185CF6519E0">was clo&s;ed by the exhibition of a tran&s;parent painting, with the figure of <HI>John Jay</HI> upon it. The figure was in full &s;tature, holding in his right hand a pair of &s;cales, containing in one &s;cale, <HI>American liberty and Independence,</HI> kick|ing the beam; in the other, <HI>British Gold,</HI> in extreme preponderance. In his left hand a Treaty, which he extended to a group of Se|nators, who were grinning with plea&s;ure and gra&s;ping at the Treaty. From the mouth of the figure i&s;&s;ued the&s;e words: <HI>come up to my price, and I will sell you my country.</HI> The fi|gure was burned at Ken&s;ington amid&s;t the ac|clamations of hundreds of citizens. Thus terminated the anniver&s;ary of American In|dependence.</Q></P>
<P>This recalls to our minds two valuable facts: 1&s;t, that this infamous libel did
<Q>e&s;cape with impunity!</Q>
and 2d, that the exhibition and actions which it records, did al&s;o
<Q>e&s;cape with impunity;</Q>
and that too in this city, under the eye of this very Judge M'Kean And, what is more, a gentleman, who, like a good citizen, turned out of his bed to endeavour to put a &s;top to the &s;candalous and di&s;graceful proce&s;&s;ion, was a&s;&s;aulted in a mo&s;t cowardly and cruel man|ner, and never obtained the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction. Not one of the rabble, nor of the ring-leaders, nor of the printers, who &s;timulated them to acti|on, and who recorded their atrocities as honour|able deeds, was ever puni&s;hed, or "<HI>bound over,</HI>" or even reprimanded!&mdash;But this was a riot and a libel again&s;t a <HI>worthy man,</HI> an officer of the <HI>Federal Government,</HI> and <HI>no tool of France</HI>; and

the&s;e circum&s;tances mu&s;t account for what can|not otherwi&s;e be accounted for.</P>
<P>BACHE, in his paper, No. 1460, calls the Honourable John Jay, then Chief Ju&s;tice of the United States of America, and now Governor of the State of New-York: he calls this gentle|man, "that <HI>damned arch traitor</HI> JOHN JAY."&mdash; And yet he was never "<HI>bound over</HI>;" and yet he never was <HI>personally attacked from the Bench;</HI> but, on the contrary, has often, &s;ince that time as well as before, &s;at at the &s;ame board with the Chief Ju&s;tice!</P>
<P>I could here name at lea&s;t one hundred of the greate&s;t and be&s;t men, that this country ever produced, who have been vilified by this repro|bate de&s;cendant of Old Franklin; but, for the rea&s;ons before mentioned, I &s;hall forbear the enumeration, and content my&s;elf with an in|&s;tance or two of his attacks on the character of GENERAL WASHINGTON, for which every good man, in every part of the world, mu&s;t and will execrate the libeller and his &s;upporters.</P>
<P>He publi&s;hed PAINE's letter to the GENERAL; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f which he claimed an exclu&s;ive copy-right, and which he boa&s;ted of having received from Paris for the purpo&s;e of publication.

<Q>the <HI>patron</HI> of <HI>fraud,</HI></Q>

&mdash;Yet the vile printer was never
<Q>bound over.</Q></P>
<P>Thus was the city of Philadelphia di&s;graced. Thus did the Chief Ju&s;tice of Penn&s;ylvania qui|etly look on, and ob&s;erve the propagation of a libel, that has excited univer&s;al indignation in the brea&s;ts of unconcerned foreigners, and for which both the writer and the printer are cen|&s;ured by their very partizans.</P>
<P>But, this was not the la&s;t &s;tab that the literary a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in had in re&s;erve for the character of this great and good man, and for the honour of America.</P>
<P>The day that the GENERAL clo&s;ed his pub|lic labours (the 4th of March, 1797,) BACHE, after announcing his retirement from the Office of Pre&s;ident, &s;ays:
<Q>If there ever was a period for rejoicing this is the moment&mdash;every heart, in unifon with the freedom and happine&s;s of the people, ought to beat high with exultation, that the name of WASHINGTON from <HI>this day ceases to give currency to political iniquity,</HI> and to <HI>legalize corruption.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Yet, we are not at the wor&s;t: for, on the 13th of March, 1797, this viperous Grand Son of Old Franklin, accu&s;ed the &s;ame eminent per&s;on of <HI>murder</HI>! brought forward a long, formal, and circum&s;tantial charge of cool, deliberate <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation,</HI>
<Q>committed by <HI>GEORGE WASHINGTON,</HI> late President of the United States.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="033523_0060_0FF7719037594BD8">The Chief Ju&s;tice has <HI>not forgotten,</HI> I dare &s;ay, that I was the only printer in the United States (with &s;hame be it &s;poken) who had the zeal and the indu&s;try to &s;earch for the documents relative to the affair alluded to (which took place in 1753); to expo&s;e the falacy of the charge, and to hold the vile in&s;trument of France up to univer&s;al abhorrence.</P>
<P>One would have thought, whatever might be the &s;ecret di&s;po&s;itions of the Chief Ju&s;tice of Penn&s;ylvania, that outward appearances, common decency, would have led them to take &s;ome little notice of the&s;e outrages or a public and private character, re&s;pected, e&s;|teemed, and revered by the wi&s;e and the virtu|ous of all nations. More e&s;pecially one would have expected this from a Judge, who now &s;eems to be &s;o anxious to pre&s;erve the reputa|tion of "<HI>youth</HI> in its <HI>innocence,</HI>" and of "<HI>old age</HI> in its <HI>gravity</HI> and <HI>wisdom;</HI>" who now, in order to excite a horror again&s;t libelling, goes back to that cruel code, the <HI>Twelve Tables of Rome,</HI> and the no le&s;s &s;anguinary laws of <HI>Valentinian</HI>; who, in his zeal to make an example, does not think it derogatory to his honourable &s;tation to point at a particular man, and call on the Jury, in ex|pre&s;s terms, for their "<HI>aid</HI>" in his puni&s;hment; and finally, who expre&s;&s;es his determination to pur&s;ue the vice of libelling with "zeal and in|dignation." From &s;uch a Judge, who would not have expected an interference; who does not be|lieve, who does not know, and does not &s;ay, that he &s;hould have been "<HI>impressed with the duties of his station,</HI>" when the reputation of the Fede|ral government was daily and hourly attacked in
<PB N="64" REF="033523_0061_0FF77191C7E604B8">
his pre&s;ence; when the fame and character of GENERAL WASHINGTON were bleeding at every pore, and when the French printer BACHE and his coadjutors were pur&s;uing the Aged Ve|teran to his dome&s;tic retreat with all the helli&s;h malignity of Pari&s;ian cannibals?&mdash;Yes, this was the time for him to be "<HI>impressed with the du|ties of his station.</HI>" This was the time for him to exert his authority of <HI>binding over;</HI> to unfold and enforce <HI>the severity of the law,</HI> and e&s;tab|li&s;h his character for <HI>impartiality</HI>:&mdash;but, this time is pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus have we &s;een the Chief Ju&s;tice of Penn|&s;ylvania wink at the mo&s;t daring and wicked libels, again&s;t God and again&s;t man, that a wri|ter can conceive or a printer can print. But, we are not yet come to what may be pro|perly called <HI>a case in point.</HI></P>
<P>I was pro&s;ecuted for publications levelled again&s;t a foreign prince, government, and mini|&s;ter; to form therefore a ju&s;t e&s;timation of the conduct and motives of tho&s;e who urged the pro&s;ecution, we mu&s;t take a &s;ketch (and a very &s;light one will &s;erve) of what other printers have publi&s;hed, <HI>with impunity,</HI> again&s;t other govern|ments, nations, and princes.</P>
<P>But, before I enter on this &s;ubject, I think my&s;elf called on to make a few remarks on that part of the Judge's Charge, which dwells, with &s;uch empha&s;is and &s;eeming dread, on the danger of offending foreign nations and potentates, par|ticularly the <HI>tender-hearted</HI> rulers of France and the king of the country of the <HI>Inquisition.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="033523_0062_0FF77194A59A6B48">After telling the Grand Jury, that I had
<Q>ran&s;acked our language for terms of reproach and in&s;ult again&s;t every <HI>disti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gui&s;hed</HI> character in <HI>France and Spain,</HI></Q>
he tells them, that, "without their aid," my conduct cannot be cor|rected, and concludes by ob&s;erving, that
<Q>the government that will not di&s;countenance, may be thought to adopt it, and be deemed <HI>justly chargeable with all the con&s;equences.</HI></Q>
&mdash;Then follow an in&s;tance of the great danger of offend|ing foreign nations in this way: the Judge re|fers to hi&s;tory above a hundred years back, and very gravely tells the Grand Jury, that
<Q>Some medals and dull je&s;ts are mentioned and repre|&s;ented as a ground of quarrel between the En|gli&s;h and Dutch in 1672, and likewi&s;e cau&s;ed Lewis the 14th to make an expedition into the United Provinces of the Netherlands in the &s;ame year, and nearly ruined that Common|wealth.</Q></P>
<P>This was an example <HI>in terrorem,</HI> and was evidently cited for the purpo&s;e of impre&s;&s;ing on the minds of the Jury, the peril that their coun|try might be placed in from &s;uffering me to "e&s;cape with impunity." But, granting for a moment, that laying a re&s;traint on the pre&s;s, <HI>for fear the effects of its freedom should offend foreign powers</HI>; allowing that &s;uch an act is not to the la&s;t degree &s;hameful and deba&s;ing, and only &s;uited to a country in the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage; allowing this, let us &s;ee if the Judge's quotation was quite correct and candid.</P>
<P>Now, I &s;ay, and every one of the mo&s;t &s;uper|ficial reading knows, that the <HI>medals</HI> and <HI>dull
<PB N="66" REF="033523_0063_0FF7719958B04060">
jests</HI> alluded to, never were, nor are they any where (except in this learned Charge)
<Q><HI>mention|ed</HI> and <HI>represented</HI> as a ground of quarrel be+tween the Engli&s;h and Dutch in 1672,</Q>
nor at any other period. HUME, who, it will hardly be|denied, is at lea&s;t as good an authority as Penn|&s;ylvania's Chief Judge, does indeed &s;ay, that
<Q>certain medals and pictures were made the <HI>miserable pretext</HI> of a mo&s;t &s;candalous breach of faith,</Q>
on the part of the profligate Charles II; but he tells us that the <HI>real grounds</HI> of the war, were, the inordinate ambition of Lewis XIV, and the thir&s;t for riches and arbitrary power of the corrupted mini&s;try of England, well known by the name of the CABAL.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides had medals and dull je&s;ts really been, as they were not, the grounds of the war, can|dour &s;hould have led the Judge to continue his reference to hi&s;tory a little further, and to tell the Grand Jury <HI>how that war terminated,</HI> and how the <HI>nearly ruined Commonwealth behaved</HI> with re&s;pect to the medals and dull je&s;ts.</P>
<P>Lewis XIV did, indeed, make a deva&s;tating and cruel expedition into the Netherlands, and reduced the Dutch to the la&s;t extremity by land, while the combined fleets of England and France nearly blocked up their ports and ruined their commerce. In this awful &s;tate of their affairs, the two unprincipled Monarchs made known to them their preten&s;ions, which, among many other humiliating terms, &s;pecified, that
<Q>all per&s;ons guilty of writing <HI>seditious libels</HI> again&s;t them, &s;hould, on complaint, be bani&s;hed for ever from the States.</Q>
&mdash;The Commonwealth, though,
<PB N="67" REF="033523_0064_0FF771F8E5C547F0">
as the Judge &s;ays, <HI>nearly ruined,</HI> &s;corned the in|&s;olent preten&s;ions; and, following the example of the PRINCE OF ORANGE (afterwards our WILLIAM III, of glorious memory) nobly re|&s;olved
<Q>to re&s;i&s;t the haughty victors, and to de|fend tho&s;e la&s;t remains of their native &s;oil, of which neither the irruptions of Lewis, nor the inundation of waters, had as yet bereaved them. Should even the ground fail them on which they might combat, they were &s;till re|&s;olved not to yield the generous &s;trife; but, flying to their &s;ettlements in the Indies, erect a new empire in tho&s;e remote regions, and pre&s;erve alive, even in the climates of &s;lavery, that liberty of which Europe was become un|worthy.</Q></P>
<P>This is what Mr. M'Kean &s;hould have told the Grand Jury; and, he &s;hould have told them be&s;ides, that this brave re&s;olution of the Dutch met with a glorious reward; that a few months &s;aw their gallant fleet a match for tho&s;e of the two monarchs united, and that the haughty king of France, driven by the PRINCE OF ORANGE from fortre&s;s to fortre&s;s and from Province to Province, at la&s;t entered his vain and frivolous capital covered with defeat and di&s;grace, before the triumphal arch of St. Dennis, erected for the celebration of his conque&s;ts, was completely out of the hands of the architect!</P>
<P>This is the pa&s;&s;age of hi&s;tory, which, above all others, the republican car dwells on with plea&s;ure; this is what the Chief Judge &s;hould have related to the jury; but, this would not have an&s;wered his purpo&s;e. Such an example
<PB N="68" REF="033523_0065_0FF771FA68E9D0E0">
of republican fortitude and heroi&s;m would have &s;ounded well from the lips of his Honour; but, the Grand Jury of Philadelphia &s;howed by their righteous deci&s;ion, that they &s;tood not in need of examples from hi&s;tory to &s;timulate them to act agreeably to the dictates of their con&s;cience, and to reject with di&s;dain every idea of fear, that their acquitting an innocent man might bring down on them&s;elves and their country the cha&s;|ti&s;ement of foreign nations.</P>
<P>Before I conclude my remarks on this part of the Charge, I cannot refrain from noticing the very odious impre&s;&s;ion it is calculated to give the world with re&s;pect to the government, and the character of the American nation.</P>
<P>It is well known, that, at the time when the paragraphs again&s;t Spain and France were pub|li&s;hed, and when the charge was delivered, the former nation was in the open violation of their treaty with this country, which had ju&s;t then been gro&s;sly in&s;ulted by their mini&s;ter; and that the latter were plundering its commerce in every part of the world, blocking up its rivers, la&s;hing its &s;ea-faring citizens like convicts, and driving its humble negociators from their capital with &s;corn and reproach. The&s;e circum&s;tances ta|ken into con&s;ideration, what mu&s;t foreigners in|fer from the Charge? Will they not &s;ay, and very ju&s;tly too:
<Q>&s;uch is your <HI>liberty of the press,</HI> &s;uch your <HI>boa&s;ted independence,</HI> that, let a nation trample on your rights, deride, in&s;ult, rob, and torture you, and your government ever &s;tands ready to inflict <HI>the punishment of a murderer</HI> on the fir&s;t man, who, in re&s;enting
<PB N="69" REF="033523_0066_0FF77258880F6290">
your injuries, &s;hall &s;tep one inch be&s;ide the line of the labyrinthian law of <HI>con&s;tructive libels</HI>; and this cruelty it conde&s;cends to, le&s;t its lenity to its friends and &s;upporters &s;hould give umbrage to an in&s;olent and perfidious foe!</Q>
&mdash;Yes; this will they &s;ay; and if there be an American, who can patiently bear the di&s;graceful imputation; I admire his Chri&s;tian humility; but I envy him not his <HI>liberty,</HI> his <HI>independence,</HI> or his <HI>republicanism.</HI></P>
<P>After all, allowing that America is &s;o beggar|ed in means and &s;o humbled in &s;pirit; allowing the&s;e <HI>independent</HI> &s;tates to be already reduced to a pitch of general va&s;&s;alage, that renders &s;uch a &s;acrifice to the pride and in&s;olence of foreign nations prudent and nece&s;&s;ary; allowing that the Judge made all this appear to be true, let us return, and &s;ee what the printers <HI>of the French faction</HI> have publi&s;hed again&s;t other govern|ments, nations, and princes, without his feeling him&s;elf
<Q>impre&s;&s;ed with the duties of his &s;ta|tion,</Q>

<P>Now, reader, prepare your&s;elf for a catalogue of the mo&s;t indecent, blacke&s;t, and mo&s;t infa|mou&s;ly libellous expre&s;&s;ions, that ever dropped from the lips or pen of mortal man. The French language is very weak and &s;teril com|pared to ours, particularly in terms of reproach and abu&s;e. Their ra&s;cals &s;pend their breath for half an hour in noi&s;y volubility, to produce a faint idea of what ours can expre&s;s in one &s;hort grind of the teeth. But, all this bitterne&s;s, all the force and fury, of this our dear mother tongue, the crafty Gaul has, we are now about to

&s;ee, had the addre&s;s to bring over into his own &s;ervice.</P>
<P>To begin with CALIENDER: this little rep|tile, who, from outward appearances &s;eems to have been born for a Chimney &s;weep, and to be now following the &s;ooty trade, made his e&s;cape from the hands of Ju&s;tice in Scotland, in the year 1793, after being apprehended as the author of a libellous pamphlet, entitled
<Q>The Political Pro|gress of Britain.</Q></P>
<P>This work, which is of con&s;iderable bulk, is nothing but a &s;tring of fal&s;hoods, inter&s;per&s;ed with the mo&s;t audacious libels on the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, and every branch of the Royal Fami|ly, which latter the author calls, the
<Q>ruffian race of British Kings.</Q>
&mdash;In one place he calls the Right Honourable William Pitt, a <HI>hardened Swindler,</HI> and in an other, he calls His Royal Highne&s;s the Prince of Wales <HI>a murderer.</HI> He, in one &s;hort &s;entence, con&s;igns to infamy both the Royal Family and the people at large. "Since the Norman Conque&s;t," &s;ays he,
<Q>Eng|land has been governed by thirty-three &s;o|vereigns; and, of the&s;e, two thirds were, each of them by an hundred different actions, <HI>deserving of the gibbet;</HI> and <HI>the people</HI> &s;eem to have been as perfectly dive&s;ted of every ho|nourable feeling, <HI>as Majesty itself.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Well, this pamphlet, though abounding in &s;uch atrocious libels as the&s;e, and though the author in his preface, boa&s;ts of having been obliged to fly from his country for publi&s;hing it, was re|publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, and was never <HI>dis|countenanced</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="033523_0068_0FF7716BE35643C0">
by the government or the Chief Ju&s;tice. Nay CALLENDER &s;ays, in his preface, that <HI>certain gentlemen,</HI> and particularly <HI>Mr. Jef|ferson,</HI> the Vice Pre&s;ident of the United States, had <HI>encouraged him</HI> to give an American edition of this infamous performance!</P>
<P>I have a dozen &s;ources to which I could ap|ply for libels again&s;t foreign princes and &s;tates. BROWN has been guilty of crimes of this kind without number, and &s;o have DUNLAP and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. The CLAYPOOLES, no longer ago than September la&s;t, calls Her Maje&s;ty the Queen of Portugal a <HI>Crazy Lady</HI> and a <HI>Lunatic.</HI> OS|WALD, to the day of his death, publi&s;hed at lea&s;t forty libels regularly, two days in a week; but he is dead; I &s;hall therefore leave him, and come to BACHE, the Chief Judge's companion at Civic Fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>There is not a prince or power of Europe, who has di&s;covered the lea&s;t inclination to op|po&s;e the French, or di&s;credit their infamous prin|ciples, whom this caitiff printer and his &s;upport|ers have not libelled in the mo&s;t outrageous man|ner.&mdash;The Emperor of Germany and his gene|rals have been called <HI>thieves</HI> and <HI>scoundrels</HI> a thou&s;and times; the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, <HI>before his defection,</HI> was called a <HI>Sharper;</HI> the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, in No. 1361, is called a <HI>She-Bear.</HI> But, the Briti&s;h nation, government, and king, have been the con&s;tant objects of their mo&s;t wicked calumnies. Mr. SMITH of Baltimore, in open Congre&s;s, called the King of Great Britain,
<Q>a mon&s;ter; <HI>a</HI> king of sea-robbers.</Q>

<Q>a mix|ture of <HI>tyranny, profligacy, brutallity,</HI> and <HI>cor|ruption.</HI></Q>
&mdash;In the letters of Franklin, publi&s;h|ed in his paper, he calls Admiral Murry
<Q>free-booter <HI>Murray.</HI></Q>
&mdash;In 1033, he calls His Britan|nic Maje&s;ty, "a <HI>prince of robbers.</HI>" In 1048, he calls him,
<Q>that prince of <HI>land and sea rob|bers,</HI> GEORGE III.</Q>
In 1031, he &s;ays, &s;peak|ing of Great Britain,

<P>Was there ever &s;uch abominable outrage as this offered to mortal man any where but in A|merica? No; &s;ince the art of writing was di&s;|covered, there never were &s;uch libels tolera|ted again&s;t any human being, whether friend or enemy. Yet, neither the government of Penn|&s;ylvania, nor the Chief Ju&s;tice, nor any other per&s;on in authority, ever interfered. No one, among&s;t all the&s;e libellers, was ever pro&s;ecuted or <HI>bound over.</HI> Their <HI>politics were perfectly French,</HI> and all went &s;moothly on.</P>
<P>Let us for a moment &s;uppo&s;e (which, howe|ver, we have no right to do), that the &s;tupid and
<PB N="74" REF="033523_0071_0FF7725ED4A88360">
ungenerous prejudice prevailing again&s;t Great Britain, formed &s;ome tri&s;ling excu&s;e for the re|mi&s;sne&s;s (to give it the milde&s;t term) of the ex|ecutive and judiciary of the &s;tate. Still, this could not apply to the libels publi&s;hed again&s;t other nations and princes; &s;ome of which had, and now have, <HI>treaties af amity</HI> with this country, and others were not, nor ever had been, its foes.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the&s;e nations there is one, the libels again&s;t which I have re&s;erved for this place: I mean <HI>Spain.</HI> For three long years the King of Spain, his government and mini&s;try, were the &s;ubject of con&s;tant abu&s;e and defamation. BACHE, in No. 1028 of his vile paper, &s;ays,
<Q>the <HI>&s;laves of Madrid</HI> will &s;oon &s;hrink from the con|querers of Toulon.</Q>
And in No. 1044, he has, &s;peaking of Spain, the&s;e words:
<Q><HI>The</HI> most cowardly of the human race;</Q>
&mdash;
<Q><HI>the</HI> Spa|ni&s;h slaves;</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>the ignorant &s;oldiery of the <HI>infamous tyrant of Castille.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now, this is the very &s;ame Prince, and the &s;ame people, that I have been pro&s;ecuted for libelling. Compare what I have &s;aid, or rather what I have publi&s;hed, concerning them; com|pare the pa&s;&s;ages in the Bill of Indictment with tho&s;e here quoted, and then prai&s;e the impartia|lity and ju&s;tice <HI>of the free and equal government of Pennsylvania&punc; Don Yrujo</HI> never thought the honour of his Ma&s;ter, when called an <HI>infa|mous tyrant,</HI> merited his zeal to defend it; nay, the very printer, who thus defamed him, the DON has employed as the printer of his <HI>insolent letter to Mr.</HI> PICKERING! This man's conduct
<PB N="75" REF="033523_0072_0FF7716922ECCFA8">
is hardly worth notice; but how &s;hall we ac|count for the conduct of the Chief Judge of Penn&s;ylvania? Surely the king of Spain's cha|racter ought to have been an object of his atten|tion <HI>then</HI> as well as <HI>now;</HI> unle&s;s we are willing to allow, that no character is under the protec|tion of the laws of Penn&s;ylvania, unle&s;s it be of <HI>persons devoted to the will of France.</HI></P>
<P>But, before I conclude this compari&s;on be|tween what I have been mo&s;t rigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecu|ted for doing, and what others have done with impunity, I &s;hall give the reader a &s;pecimen or two of the conduct of the officers of this Penn|&s;ylvania Government <HI>(not excluding the Chief Judge himself),</HI> towards foreign nations and princes.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor</HI> (Mifflin), a&s;&s;i&s;ted at a civic fe&s;ti|val, when the following toa&s;ts were drunk; which were publi&s;hed in mo&s;t of the news-papers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See BACHE of 11 Feb. 1795.</NOTE></P>

has been, by others, pro|claimed as "an infamous tyrant." But, there was yet one fact wanting to render this &s;canda|lous pro&s;ecution complete; and that fact is at hand.</P>
<P>The reader, by turning back to page 36, will perceive, that one of my
<Q>fal&s;e, &s;candalous, and malicious libels,</Q>
as they are mo&s;t fal&s;ly and &s;candalou&s;ly called, did not originate with me, nor in my paper. It was copied from Mr. FEN|NO's paper <HI>of an anterior date.</HI> This material circum&s;tance was, very cautiou&s;ly and <HI>candidly,</HI> kept <HI>out of the Bill of Indictment,</HI> though the heads and titles of the other two publications were mentioned; and there is every rea&s;on to believe, that it e&s;caped the attention of the Grand Jury.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="033523_0078_0FF7726F028D7528">The Indictment, as is u&s;ual, concludes with &s;tating the tendency of the crime, part of which is,
<Q>the <HI>evil example</HI> of all others in the like ca&s;e offending.</Q>
This is mo&s;t certainly very proper: for, to prevent the effects of <HI>evil exam|ple,</HI> is, or ought to be, the principle object of all puni&s;hments. But, how could I be &s;aid to &s;et the <HI>evil example,</HI> when it was notorious that I had been far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by others, who had never been called to account, and when the very pub|lication, for which I was pro&s;ecuted, I had co|pied, word for word, from another printer, a na|tive of the country, and living in the &s;ame city with my&s;elf? Mr. FENNO has never been <HI>bound over.</HI> He has never been arre&s;ted: nor has he been even &s;poken to on the &s;ubject. He has heard of my being pro&s;ecuted; but he little imagines it was for his crimes.</P>
<P>Thus, in the capital of America, amid&s;t all its <HI>vaunted liberty of the pre&s;s,</HI> and under the "<HI>equal</HI>" and "<HI>humane</HI>" laws of Penn&s;ylvania, another man has been allowed to print and publi&s;h, not only with impunity, but without reproof, a para|graph, for the re-publi&s;hing of which, I have been &s;eized as a criminal, expo&s;ed to the danger of a heavy fine, of impri&s;onment at hard labour, of being crammed in a dungeon, and <HI>of suffering the punishment of a murderer</HI>!</P>

I fear not, that, with the indulgence of the reader, I &s;hall make good my promi&s;e. For the motives from which I do this I am re&s;pon&s;ible to no one: if, however, an apology is thought nece&s;&s;ary, let it be &s;ought for in the abominable treatment I have experienced.</P>
<P>Since the revolution, which terminated in the independence of the&s;e States, almo&s;t every pub|lication

here, and every democratic one in Great Britain, has held the liberty of the American pre&s;s up in triumphant exaltation over that of the pre&s;s of Great Britain. How many vo|lumes might be filled up with in&s;tances of this fort! How many thou&s;and times is the vain boa&s;t repeated in the cour&s;e of each revolving &s;un! To refer to particular publications is like &s;eek|ing for proofs of daylight or of darkne&s;s: but, there is one that I mu&s;t refer to, becau&s;e it &s;o aptly an&s;wers my purpo&s;e. It is a letter of the arch &s;ectarian PRIESTLEY, who, not content without companions in his fallen &s;tate, has &s;par|ed no pains to inveigle his countrymen hither. He tells the people of England, in this letter, &s;ent there to be publi&s;hed, that "<HI>Here</HI> (in <HI>italicks</HI> to mark the contra&s;t)
<Q><HI>Here</HI> the pre&s;s is free. <HI>Here</HI> truth is not a libel.</Q>
This &s;atanic letter contains many other a&s;&s;ertions equally <HI>false,</HI> which I may one day or other expo&s;e; but, at pre&s;ent, I notice only what appertains to my &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>The poor Doctor was always a bold a&s;&s;erter; but, in the ca&s;e before us, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, a more &s;crupulous man might have been led into the adoption of a fal&s;hood. The peal has been &s;o ince&s;&s;antly rung in our ears. We have been &s;o bored with it in all &s;ea&s;ons, at all hours, eating, drinking and &s;leeping time not excepted, that it required a degree of incredulity rarely to be met with to re&s;i&s;t the temptation to belief. The a&s;&s;er|tion is, neverthele&s;s fal&s;e; and it is a fal&s;hood too, which the &s;afety of every one (particularly <HI>a foreigner</HI>), who touches pen or types, requires to be clearly and fully expo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="033523_0081_0FF77279BA42CF68"><HI>That</HI> TRUTH <HI>may be a libel in Great Britain, and that it cannot be a libel here,</HI> is generally be|lieved; and is thought to con&s;titute the differ|ence in the laws of the two countries, on this head. But this is no more than a vulgar notion, taken up from ignorance, and propagated from vanity and envy. I defy any man to produce me a &s;ingle law, or a &s;ingle con&s;titution (for, "thank God," as the Judge &s;ays, we have ma|ny); I defy him to cite me a clau&s;e or &s;entence, that &s;ays, or that leaves room to &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>truth</HI> may not be deemed a libel, here as well as in England. The United States, and the individual States of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, New Hamp&s;hire, Ver|mont, Maryland, North Carolina, and Kentuc|key, each of them &s;ay, that
<Q><HI>the</HI> press ought to be free,</Q>
in a &s;hort vague &s;entence, of which any lawyer of a common capacity would give as many different interpretations as there can be rung changes upon twelve bells, which are &s;aid to amount to &s;ome millions. Penn&s;ylvania and Tenne&s;ee &s;ay the &s;ame, and more. They &s;ay, with the other States, and with the laws of Eng|land, that <HI>the press shall be free;</HI> and they add, that
<Q>in pro&s;ecutions for the publication of pa|pers, inve&s;tigating the <HI>official</HI> conduct of <HI>officers,</HI> or where the matter publi&s;hed is <HI>proper for public information,</HI> the <HI>truth</HI> thereof may be given in evidence.</Q>
Connecticut, New York, New Jer&s;ey, Delaware, Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia, have had the prudence to &s;ay no|thing at all about the matter; and, as to Rhode I&s;land, its con&s;titution is neither more nor le&s;s than a new edition of the Charter granted them by
<Q>the abundant grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion</Q>
of King Charles II. Thus it

&s;tands, bound up with the other &s;ixteen con&s;titu|tions, without the addition or exclu&s;ion of a &s;in|gle word. And, all the other States, without one exception, have taken &s;pecial care to bind down their rulers <HI>never to deprive them of the common law of England,</HI> but to pre&s;erve it inviolate to them and their children. Amid&s;t all their va|ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, when they were &s;tark &s;taring drunk with revolutionary triumph, they had the good &s;en&s;e, the &s;aving grace, to cling fa&s;t round this old trunk of &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial liberty. Long may they hold by it, and never &s;uffer it to be chipped away by quibbling &s;tatutes and partial Judges!</P>
<P>Hence then, it happens, very luckily for me, that, if there be any State, in which the common law of England, re&s;pecting libels, is departed from, it is poor Penn&s;ylvania. And, what is the mighty "ble&s;&s;ing" &s;he has had
<Q>vouch&s;afed unto her?</Q>
Why,
<Q>in pro&s;ecutions for the publication of papers inve&s;tigating the <HI>official</HI> conduct of <HI>officers,</HI> or where the matter pub|li&s;hed is <HI>proper for public information,</HI> the <HI>truth</HI> may be <HI>given in evidence.</HI></Q>
So that, you will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, Me&s;&s;ieurs authors and prin|ters, that, fir&s;t, the per&s;on about whom you pub|li&s;h mu&s;t be <HI>an officer;</HI> and next, you mu&s;t touch upon nothing but his <HI>official</HI> conduct. Precious privilege! It is a mere net to catch the unwary: it leaves not the lea&s;t &s;cope for cen&s;uring any public man what&s;oever, but &s;eems, on the con|trary, intended to &s;helter his faults and his crimes from the la&s;h of the pre&s;s. By declaring that the <HI>truth</HI> &s;hall be admitted as evidence as to &s;uch publications only as touch his <HI>official</HI> conduct, his private character and conduct are held up as &s;acred and inviolable.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="033523_0083_0FF77280191F32B8">But, the Judge, the expo&s;itor of the con&s;titu|tion, goes &s;till further. He tells us, that the pub|lications, re&s;pecting the <HI>official</HI> conduct of offi|cers, mu&s;t not only be <HI>true,</HI> but "<HI>candid</HI>" and "<HI>decent</HI>" al&s;o. This is a maxim laid down in his charge, and every one will agree, that he was ready to put it in practice. Comfortable writing and publi&s;hing it mu&s;t be, thus penned up with vague and indefinite epithets! <HI>Truth</HI> may be de|fined and a&s;certained, but what publication is there, which, by &s;ome quirk or other, might not be repre&s;ented as <HI>uncandid</HI> or <HI>indecent</HI>?&mdash;Yet, as if this left the pre&s;s &s;till <HI>too free.</HI> The Judge tells us, that &s;uch publications, mu&s;t not only be <HI>decent, candid,</HI> and <HI>true,</HI> but, be&s;ides all this, they mu&s;t "have an eye <HI>&s;olely</HI> to the <HI>public good.</HI>&mdash; Here is a pretty latitude for quibble and conte&s;|tation!

<P>One would now think that the officers of Penn|&s;ylvania were &s;afely enough fortified again&s;t the attacks of the pre&s;s; but the Chief Ju&s;tice was re&s;olved to guard them at every point; and there|fore, after throwing up ba&s;tions in abundance and out-works upon out-works, he &s;urrounds the whole with a line of contravalation, thus:
<Q>Where libels are printed again&s;t <HI>per&s;ons employ|ed in a public capacity,</HI> they receive an <HI>aggrava|tion,</HI> as they tend to <HI>scandali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the government.</HI></Q>
Charming liberty of the pre&s;s! Again&s;t men thus defended, what devil of a printer is there, who will ever dare to fire a &s;ingle &s;hot? Suppo&s;e, for
<PB N="87" REF="033523_0084_0FF7728336F74618">
in&s;tance, that a Judge were to be guilty of &s;ome mo&s;t vile and infamous offence: &s;uppo&s;e he were <HI>to thieve;</HI> one would think that a free pre&s;s &s;hould take &s;ome little notice of it; but you mu&s;t not do it, becau&s;e thieving is not (or, at lea&s;t, I am &s;ure, it ought not to be) the <HI>official</HI> conduct of a Judge, and therefore the truth cannot be given in evidence; and becau&s;e the libel would "receive an aggravation," as it would mo&s;t cer|tainly "tend to <HI>scandalize the government.</HI>"&mdash; Thus is the pre&s;s of Penn&s;ylvania nailed down; but if &s;uch a thing had happened in England, or in France previous to the revolution, the prin|ters would have blazoned it from one end of the empire, nay, from one end of the world to the other; and if they could have found a convey|ance to the Moon, thither it would have went. It is right to curb &s;uch "licentious" fellows. Their blabbing ought to be prevented; and for doing this give me not a mighty kingdom with &s;tanding armies and letters de cachet, but give me a little &s;ang "Repre&s;entative Democracy," armed with the power of <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nding them over at disc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etion,</HI> and inflicting on them <HI>the punishment of a murderer.</HI></P>
<P>As to the latter provi&s;ion of the clau&s;e above quoted, that the <HI>truths</HI> publi&s;hed mu&s;t be <HI>proper for public information,</HI> it is far wor&s;e than nothing; for, what is <HI>proper for public information</HI> is no libel according to the common law, and there|fore no <HI>truth,</HI> nor any evidence what&s;oever, is nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify its publication, in the eye of that law; but, according to the new maxim, what is very proper for public information may be a libel, if the truth of every word of it cannot be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="033523_0085_0FF77284C462FC60">I think I have now &s;atisfied the reader, that, in point of law, the American pre&s;s has gained nothing over that of Great Britain. But, the Chief Ju&s;tice, as if he really intended to aid my undertaking, and to do away every doubt on the &s;ubject, took good care to tell the Grand Jury, that, <HI>with respect to libels, the common law was confirmed and established by the Constitution itself.</HI> Where then is the advantage derived from the new order of things? If the con&s;titution of Penn|&s;ylvania, which is, according to the modern ap|plication of the word, the free-e&s;t in America; if this con&s;titution has done <HI>no more</HI> than confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h the common law of England, with re&s;pect to the liberty of the pre&s;s, how can any man have the impudence to boa&s;t of that liberty being greater here than it is in England, where that &s;ame common law &s;till exi&s;ts in all its pleni|tude and purity, and is admini&s;tered by men the mo&s;t learned, independent and righteous in the world?</P>
<P>Thus far then, the liberty of the pre&s;s, is, in the eye <HI>the law,</HI> the &s;ame in both countries; but this does not prove, that there exi&s;t no circum&s;tances in America, peculiar to it, which render the exer|ci&s;e of this liberty un&s;afe, and of cour&s;e re&s;trains its operations. It is not only the principles pro|fe&s;&s;ed in a country, that we are to look to, but al&s;o the <HI>practice</HI> of that country. The thing cal|led the con&s;titution of France, for example, &s;ays that the <HI>free use</HI> of the pre&s;s is a right <HI>sacred</HI> and <HI>inviolable;</HI> but this does not prevent the tyrants from &s;eizing the printers by &s;cores, and tran&s;|porting them without a trial and without a hear|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="033523_0086_0FF7728646C5F2A0">The pre&s;s has been, and &s;till is, re&s;trained in this country, 1&s;t, by the notion, which has been, for evident motives, inculcated by artful men, that no <HI>private character</HI> ought to be publickly cen&s;ured. 2nd, by the very dangerous privilege, which <HI>foreign agents</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s, in having <HI>a choice of governments,</HI> under which to bring their pro|&s;ecutions. And, 3rd, by the terror, nece&s;&s;arily excited in every printer, by the <HI>disgraceful and cruel punishment,</HI> to which he is liable.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e re&s;traints, nothing can give us a better idea of the extent to which it is carried, than the bold a&s;&s;ertions contained in the Chief Judge's Charge. He tells us, that though a publication may not reflect any moral turpi|tude on the party, it may yet be libelious, if it <HI>thwarts the said party's desire of appearing agree|able in life.</HI> This is a very comfortable doctrine to every <HI>scoundrel,</HI> and particularly to every <HI>whore,</HI> for you will not find one of either de&s;cription, who does not de&s;ire <HI>to appear agreeable in life.</HI> The rea&s;onablene&s;s of this doctrine his Honour &s;upports by telling us, that if any man does wrong, recour&s;e may be had to the courts of ju&s;tice, and that there can be no nece&s;&s;ity, <HI>nor reason,</HI> for ap|peals to the people in <HI>news-papers</HI> or <HI>pamphlets.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, you &s;ee, if his Honour &s;huts up the pre&s;s, he has the goodne&s;s to open his court to us.

If a Judge, or any other awful character, were to be detected in &s;hop-lifting, or in the commi&s;|&s;ion of any &s;uch ba&s;e and infamous crime; or if a lady were to choo&s;e, now and then, to relieve her hu&s;band by retiring a few months to the arms of a friend, mu&s;t I &s;ew up my lips, and mu&s;t my pre&s;s be as tame and contented as the cuckold him&s;elf?</P>
<P>Such may, indeed, be the practice of the Ame|rican pre&s;s; but is it that of the pre&s;s of Great Britain. Only compare one of the London papers with an American paper, and you will &s;oon &s;ee which comes from the free-e&s;t pre&s;s. Is there a crime, is there a fault or a folly, which the edi|tors and print-&s;ellers in London do not la&s;h? They dive into every a&s;&s;embly and every hou&s;e; they &s;pare characters neither public nor private; neither the people, the gentry, the clergy, the nobility nor the royal family it&s;elf, is &s;heltered from their ridicule or their cen&s;ure. Let any American but open PETER PINDAR's works and the LONDON MORNING CHRONICLE; then let him read Judge M'Kean's Charge, and blu&s;h at the boa&s;t that has been &s;o often made about the liberty of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>I am far from approving of all, or of hardly any thing, contained in the works of Pindar and the Morning Chronicle: the Chronicle is the devoted tool of an infamous Jacobin faction, and the far greater part of Pindar's monotonous

This &s;ituation of things, however, has been produced by a combi|nation of &s;ingular circum&s;tances, and it may pro|bably wear away as tho&s;e circum&s;tances change. But, the evil, of which I have now to complain, is of a nature not to be worn away by the hand of time alone. It is built on law and con&s;titution, or, at lea&s;t, it operates as if it were, and admits of no remedy, except by &s;ome po&s;itive act of a convention or the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>It was hoped (though, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, with very little rea&s;on), that America, when &s;e|parated from Great Britain, would never more be affected by the quarrels of European nations. PAINE told the people, that they would have no|thing to do but grow rich, while other nations &s;hould be at war. "Our commerce," &s;ays he,
<Q>will always &s;ecure us the <HI>peace and friend&s;hip</HI> of all Europe.</Q>
This, by woeful experience, we find to have been like all the re&s;t of &s;hallow|headed Paine's predictions. But this is not the wor&s;t. Not only does America feel the pre&s;&s;ure of European wars, in a degree equal to that felt by the people of Great Britain at this moment;

but &s;he is cur&s;ed with a foreign faction in her bo&s;om, by which &s;he is continually curbed, har|ra&s;&s;ed, injured, in&s;ulted, and betrayed.</P>
<P>The politics of the country are become &s;o connected, &s;o interwoven, with the politics of other nations, France in particular, that they are never &s;poken of in any other than a relative light. I verily believe, and indeed I am cer|tain, that, as to numbers, men are more equally divided, at this time, between the Federal govern|ment and the French, than they were in the year 1778, between the Congre&s;s and the King of England.</P>
<P>Nor does this pernicious divi&s;ion &s;top here. The State governments have their &s;ides. One State is called a <HI>Federal State</HI> and another an <HI>Antifederal State:</HI> and it is notorious, that the politics of the per&s;ons, who admini&s;ter the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|altern governments, are generally fixed and uniform on one &s;ide or the other.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;tate of things, only think of the danger of allowing foreign mini&s;ters and agents <HI>to choose the government, under which to bring their prosecutions!</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this dreadful pri|vilege, will not every foreign agent take good care to in&s;titute his pro&s;ecutions under that go|vernment, to which the party pro&s;ecuted has, by his politics, rendered him&s;elf obnoxious? And, where this can be done, what &s;ort of chance, I pray, is there for a man who meddles with the pre&s;s, and who happens to be &s;ituated in a State, where he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be obnoxious to one of the two governments, under which he lives?</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="033523_0092_0FF77430F21CB088">My own ca&s;e is a &s;triking exemplification of the danger of this privilege. Yrujo the Spaniard applied fir&s;t to the Federal Government to pro|&s;ecute me, and was informed that it would be done in the Federal courts. But, this he remon|&s;trated again&s;t, and reque&s;ted that it might be done in the courts of Penn&s;ylvania; in which courts M'Kean is Chief Judge.&mdash;Now, why this reque&s;t? Why prefer one juri&s;diction to another? The courts are held at the &s;ame place, and near|ly at the &s;ame time. The Judges of the Federal court are men famous for their learning and their integrity; and, I am &s;ure, ordering the trial in this court ought to have been looked upon as a mark of re&s;pect to the Spani&s;h King. How, then, are we to account for this extraordinary reque&s;t?</P>
<P>Leaving the reader to account for it in his own way, I &s;hall tell him that the reque&s;t was refu&s;ed; and that, then, a new pro&s;ecution was &s;et on foot under the government of Penn&s;ylva|nia. The matter contained in the above bill of Indictment was hunted out; and, let it be well remembered, that every pretended libel con|tained in this bill, was publi&s;hed <HI>before I was bound over on the first complaint.</HI> In po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this fact, the reader will be able to gue&s;s what the hopes of the pro&s;ecutor were founded on.</P>
<P>The matter in the bill of indictment, if libel|lous, was &s;urely &s;o before I was bound over the fir&s;t time. How comes it then, that it was not included in the fir&s;t complaint? This puzzled the Grand Jury. The thing appeared &s;o unna|tural to them, that they &s;ent for the two Attorneys
<PB N="96" REF="033523_0093_0FF774336A9A6710">
General to explain the my&s;tery; when it was found, that they had taken care, in drawing their indictments, to &s;teer clear of each other; in do|ing which I, by-the-bye, do not mean to hint, that either of the&s;e gentlemen did any more than his duty.</P>
<P>Thus was &s;een the &s;ingular phenomenon of a printer pro&s;ecuted by <HI>two governments,</HI> at one and the &s;ame time, for different parts of one and the &s;ame offence! And this is <HI>American liberty of the press!</HI></P>
<P>Did Engli&s;hmen ever hear of any thing of this kind before? No; they have <HI>one</HI> Government, <HI>one</HI> law, and <HI>one</HI> con&s;titution for all. In their country, neither foreigner nor native, plaintiff nor defendant, has a choice of juri&s;dictions, tri|bunals, or judges. Where the offence is com|mitted, there mu&s;t it be tried. They have no cla&s;hing of governments of oppo&s;ite politics, un|der which every printer is in hourly danger, from the intrigues of foreign agents, and is obliged to tack and &s;hift, like a polacre with contending winds between Sylla and Charibdis. No; in England, all is fair and free. The path is &s;im|ple: the law is one and the &s;ame, and is equal in its operations in every place and towards all parties. It is founded in wi&s;dom and in ju&s;tice, and is admini&s;tered with candour, impartiality, and mercy.</P>
<P>The third re&s;traint on the liberty of the Ame|rican pre&s;s, and the la&s;t which I &s;hall notice, <HI>at this time</HI> is, <HI>the fear which mu&s;t be naturally ex|cited in every writer and printer, by the disgrace|ful and cruel puni&s;hment, to which he is continu|ally exposed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="033523_0094_0FF7716537E280D8">After all that we have heard and &s;een about the <HI>mildness</HI> and <HI>humanity</HI> of the American laws; after all the cant of the <HI>tender-hearted</HI> Bri&s;&s;ot; after all the &s;illy enlogiums on the pri&s;ons of Philadelphia, &s;pread abroad in pamphlets, &s;peech|es, and paragraphs; and after all the &s;arca&s;tic and acrimonious invective which the American pre&s;s is continually pouring out again&s;t the <HI>san|guinary</HI> code of Great Britain: bored with all this, I &s;ay, even to &s;urfeiting, my pre&s;ent com|plaint mu&s;t appear very extraordinary. Let it. All that I have to do, is to prove it well founded.</P>
<P>The liberty of doing any thing, is greater or le&s;s, in proportion to the puni&s;hment that the law awards for it. I am, therefore, far from pre|tending that the Americans do not, in &s;ome re|&s;pects, po&s;&s;e&s;s more liberty than the Engli&s;h. They are in le&s;s danger, when they &s;teal, rob, forge, coin, and murder; for, the&s;e crimes are here puni&s;hed with <HI>fine, jail imprisonment, im|prisonment at hard labour,</HI> or <HI>solitary confinement</HI>; whereas, in England, they are puni&s;hed with <HI>death.</HI> But, let tho&s;e, who have rea&s;on, boa&s;t of this &s;ort of liberty. It is not what I want. I only contend for liberty to write and to print.</P>
<P>This liberty is a right, &s;anctioned by law, as far as a certain line, all beyond which is called libelling. This line reaches, as I have clearly proved, ju&s;t as far in America as it does in Eng|land, and no farther. All that we have to do then is to &s;ee, which country inflicts puni&s;hments the <HI>least severe</HI> on tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; for, in that country the pre&s;s mu&s;t be <HI>most free.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="033523_0095_0FF774381726F0E0">By only ca&s;ting our eyes on the Chief Judge's Charge, we &s;hall perceive, that the puni&s;hments are ten fold more &s;evere in America than in England. In England, a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the laws of the pre&s;s, or, in other words, a libeller, is pu|ni&s;hable by <HI>fine,</HI> by <HI>imprisonment in jail,</HI> by <HI>standing in the pillory</HI>; or by any two, or all three, of them. But, what is his puni&s;hment in America? Why, in the fir&s;t place, <HI>fine</HI> and <HI>jail imprisonment,</HI> as in England, and to the&s;e may be added, impri&s;onment <HI>at hard labour,</HI> and even <HI>solitary confinement in a dungeon,</HI> at the <HI>discretion of the court;</HI> and all this too in a country, where the pro&s;ecutor may have <HI>a choice of courts</HI>!</P>
<P>As far as relates to <HI>fines</HI> and <HI>jail imprisonment,</HI> the code of the two countries is the &s;ame; but, in&s;tead of the momentary &s;hame of the pillory, the American libeller, whether writer or printer, is liable to the la&s;ting pain and di&s;grace of hard labour, and to the more horrid puni&s;hment of the dungeon. Standing in the pillory, which is the wor&s;t an Engli&s;h libeller can undergo, is over in a few hours. The &s;ufferer is then placed in jail, where he is as free as a detention of his per|&s;on will admit of. He can &s;ee, hear, read and conver&s;e. He is at ca&s;e; can be vi&s;ited by his friends; nay, <HI>Callender</HI> (the run-away Scotch|man) boa&s;ts, that his a&s;&s;ociates even &s;old their libels in Newgate. What is this puni&s;hment compared to continual <HI>hard labour</HI>? And what is hard labour, or any thing el&s;e, compared to being thrown into a cell, and cut off, not only from friends and family, but from every human being?</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="033523_0096_0FF7743AC063ABA0">But, we mu&s;t not drop the &s;ubject here. Pu|ni&s;hments, as to their influence in &s;ociety, and con&s;equently as to their re&s;traint on the pre&s;s, mu&s;t be con&s;idered <HI>relatively;</HI> for, what may be a very light puni&s;hment in one country, may be a very heavy, and even a very cruel one, in another. In England, for in&s;tance, robbery, forgery, mur|der, &amp;c. are puni&s;hed with <HI>death:</HI> in America the&s;e crimes are puni&s;hed with <HI>har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> labour,</HI> or <HI>solitary confinement.</HI> So that, to inflict the&s;e lat|ter puni&s;hments on a libeller <HI>here,</HI> is exactly as cruel as it would be to inflict death on him in England.</P>
<P>What were the motives of the rulers, who le&s;&s;ened the puni&s;hment for <HI>murder,</HI> and other hor|rid crimes, while they augmented the puni&s;hment for <HI>libelling,</HI> I mu&s;t leave tho&s;e to determine, who boa&s;t &s;o much about the liberty of their pre&s;s; but, this I will undertake to &s;ay, that it is mo&s;t excellently well calculated to re&s;train, intimi|date, and over awe, every one who has any thing to do with writing and printing. What man will ever dare to communicate his thoughts to the public, while it is probable, or even <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> that his writing will procure him a place in that "<HI>temple</HI> of <HI>humanity,</HI>" as it has been called, the Philadelphia pri&s;on; where, dre&s;&s;ed in a jail uniform, penned up among&s;t run-away thieving negro &s;laves; among&s;t robbers, forgers, &s;odom|ites, and murderers; where, in &s;hort, among&s;t convicts of every colour and of every crime, he is employed in the polite art of pounding hemp, with the infinite &s;atisfaction of being exhibited to travelling <HI>philanthropists</HI> as a
<Q>living monu|ment of American <HI>mildness</HI> and <HI>humanity</HI>?</Q>&mdash;
<PB N="100" REF="033523_0097_0FF7743DF5B73880">
And, if this be too much for a man of reputation and talents to bear, how &s;hall he dare to brave the horrors of a cell; to be &s;ecluded from friends, parents, wife, children, and all that ren|ders life worth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing; to be barred up for months, or for years, like a condemned malefac|tor; and this too at the di&s;cretion of a court, cho&s;en, perhaps, by his pro&s;ecutor?</P>
<P>Did Engli&s;hmen . . . . . . . . . . . but, why do I pur&s;ue in the odious compari&s;on?&mdash;Did even Frenchmen ever feel a re&s;traint like this?&mdash;The Ba&s;tile!&mdash;it was bad enough, to be &s;ure; but, a writer confined there, had, at lea&s;t, the con&s;ola|tion of knowing, that he was di&s;tingui&s;hed from felons and murderers. Though far too &s;everely puni&s;hed, he was not covered with everla&s;ting di&s;grace and infamy. Literature, though the abu&s;e of it was cruelly cha&s;ti&s;ed, was not degra|ded, was not rendered at once hateful and de&s;|picable, as it is by the indi&s;criminating code of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding all we have &s;een, the Chief Judge has the mode&s;ty to tell the Grand Jury, from the bench, that <Q>the criminal law of <HI>this State</HI> is &s;o pregnant with <HI>justice,</HI> &s;o agree|able to <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> &s;o full of <HI>equity</HI> and <HI>clemency,</HI> that even tho&s;e who &s;uffer by it, <HI>cannot charge it with rigour</HI></Q>!!!&mdash;This was too much. He might, at any rate, have &s;pared us the mortifica|tion of li&s;tening to this. But, it is the fa&s;hion. Almo&s;t every public harrangue has &s;ome &s;uch vaunting conclu&s;ion. It may be good policy, to be &s;ure, as it tends, to keep the people here in excellent humour, while it excites envy in tho&s;e

of ther nations, makes them di&s;contented whit their lot, and invites them to cultivate the de&s;erts of America; but then, the greate&s;t care imagin|able &s;hould be taken, not to lay the iron finger on &s;uch men as are not formed for pa&s;&s;ive &s;uf|france, and particularly if they are Britons; for they, above all others, will not whi&s;per their cur&s;es to the winds: they will turn their eyes towards their native land: they will compare what they have lo&s;t with what they have gained; nor will all the terrors of hard labour and a Phi|ladelphia dungeon, ever, I tru&s;t, deter them from proclaiming the account to the world.</P>
<P>I have now accompli&s;hed my object. I have expo&s;ed the conduct of my enemies, and I have amply proved, that the pre&s;s is more free in Great Britain than it is in America. As to the motives by which I have been actuated, though I frankly confe&s;s, that had I not been injured, had I not been &s;ingled out as an object of legal vengeance, no part of this pamphlet would ever have been written or thought of; yet, I am far from wi&s;hing to throw an odium on the people of the&s;e States in general, and to repre&s;ent them as a tame degenerate race of mortals. On the contrary, I know that a very great majority of them have felt, and expre&s;&s;ed, the utmo&s;t indig|nation at the treatment I have received. The deci&s;ion of the Grand Jury alone, con&s;idering the charge that was made to them, is &s;ufficient to prove, that the &s;pirit of true liberty is yet alive on this &s;ide the Atlantic. That deci&s;ion, and the joy which it excited among&s;t all the re&s;pectable inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia, are fre&s;h in every one's memory, and will, I am &s;ure, be

I &s;tand in need of none. My good hone&s;t parents taught me the labours of the field, and, with the&s;e, they taught me independ|ence of mind. It has plea&s;ed God to ble&s;s me with health, and with limbs to gain my bread; and, while I am able to do this by the &s;pade or the plough, I will never &s;eek for wealth nor for ea&s;e, by fawning for popular favour, or by bu|rying my injuries in &s;ilent &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
