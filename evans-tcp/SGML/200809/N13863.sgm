<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><Q>THAT mankind univer&s;ally &s;hall, in the final i&s;&s;ue of the Go&s;pel plan of mercy, be deli|vered from the bondage of corruption, and be ad|mitted to the felicity of the &s;ons of God,</Q>
we are told by the compiler of the pamphlet now under con|&s;ideration, "is no novel doctrine." This is the <HI>truth,</HI> but not the <HI>whole truth.</HI> Had this gentleman been di&s;po&s;ed to have made his information compleat, he would have &s;ubjoined, it is a doctrine, which has mo&s;t generally been reprobated in the Prote&s;tant Churches, as mo&s;t erroneous, and de&s;tructive to the &s;ouls of men.</P>
<P>In the following &s;heets, the author has endeavoured to explain the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, which have been offered in defence of Univer&s;al Salvation. To this he has added a &s;hort view re&s;pecting the nece&s;&s;ity of fu|ture puni&s;hment, and the ends it an&s;wers in the moral government of God. Brevity was the object for the pre|&s;ent; &s;ince it is very probable this important &s;ubject will employ other pens, and, in proper time, be di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed more at large.</P>
<P>The author is no friend to controver&s;y, for its own &s;ake. He cannot, however, be of opinion with tho&s;e per&s;ons, who believe that controver&s;ial writings, on the fundamentals of religion, and when carried on with decency, are almo&s;t always unprofitable, and the en|couragement of them imprudent, and unwi&s;e: For certainly, whenever any doctrines, &s;uppo&s;edly erroneous, are not only exhibited, but very much attended to, and by numbers, even favourably thought of, there is no better method of counteracting the con&s;equences which are likely to follow, than by publicly bring|ing them to the &s;tandard of all &s;acred truth, and giv|ing them, by this rule, a fair and candid trial. And it is much to be doubted, whether a di&s;po&s;ition to check every thing of this kind, can be attributed to any thing &s;hort of the want of proper zeal in the cau&s;e
<PB N="iv" REF="017524_0003_0FA12B646F0B51D8">
of truth, or what may be called &s;inful la&s;&s;itude, and &s;piritual &s;leep.</P>
<P>The compiler of the pamphlet on Univer&s;al Salva|tion, &s;eems to promi&s;e that it will act as an antidote again&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of
<Q>a &s;tranger, who has of him|&s;elf a&s;&s;umed the character of a preacher,</Q>
and di&s;|cour&s;ed on this &s;ubject,
<Q>in direct contradiction to the whole tenor of the New Te&s;tament books, from their beginning to their end.</Q>
It is true, that learning and human judgment mu&s;t be at a very low &s;tate indeed, when it &s;hall become nece&s;&s;ary to rea&s;on in a formal manner again&s;t opinions of this kind, or in oppo&s;ition to the writer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Relly on Union.</NOTE> from whom they are &s;elected or deduced. But, &s;ince the compiler, ju&s;t mentioned, while he promi&s;es unconditional, and eternal &s;alvation to all men, attempts not to a&s;certain any preci&s;e period to the duration of the puni&s;hment which is to proceed,&mdash;and it may be judged, that the mo&s;t of men, from a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;elf-flattery, and an uncon&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the evil of &s;in, will be ready to believe it will be very &s;hort, it ought to have occurred to his mind, that the oppo&s;ition he is profe&s;&s;ed|ly making again&s;t tho&s;e, who pre&s;ume there will be no degree of puni&s;hment after the judgment day, is very trifling;&mdash;that they will be ready enough to e&s;teem him as one of their own party, and imagine that a coale&s;cence in opinion is not far remote.&mdash;
<Q>If this kind of preaching</Q>
and writing
<Q>be encouraged, it may prove as hurtful to civil &s;ociety, as to religion.</Q></P>
<P>"Would to God it might be realized," not only
<Q>that there is the &s;ame rea&s;on from Scripture, to be|lieve there is a <HI>Hell,</HI> as a <HI>Heaven,</HI></Q>
but, that as all impenitent per&s;ons and workers of iniquity, &s;hall have their portion in the <HI>one,</HI> &s;o they &s;hall, for ever, be ex|cluded from the <HI>other.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>FUTURE PUNISHMENT</HI> ILLUSTRATED AND PROVED.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t text produced in favour of univer&s;al Salvation, is 1 Tim. ii. 3.
<Q>God our Saviour, who will have all men to be &s;aved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth.</Q></P>
<P>The more general opinion of commentators, who have written on this pa&s;&s;age, and the mo&s;t obvious of all is, that it was de&s;igned to militate again&s;t the prejudices of the Jews, who had imbibed very contracted ideas concerning the benefits which were to re&s;ult from the mi&s;&s;ion, and death of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It is well known&punc; that at fir&s;t they &s;uppo&s;ed, he was to become a temporal Prince, and redeem them from the Roman yoke; and although, by his &s;ufferings and crucifixion, they were undeceived in this, they &s;till re|tained the opinion, that &s;alvation was to be confined to their own nation.</P>
<P>When the Apo&s;tle Peter was &s;ent to the hou&s;e of Cornelius, to preach to a number of Gentiles, and
<Q>the Holy Gho&s;t fell on them which heard the word, then they of the circumci&s;ion were a&s;toni&s;hed, as many as came with Peter, becau&s;e that on the Gentiles
<PB N="6" REF="017524_0005_0FA12B65EF592F70">
al&s;o, was poured out the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q>
Acts x. 44, 45. And &s;o powerfully did this mi&s;con|ception prevail, that even afterwards, there aro&s;e very great debates on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Saint Paul, therefore, in giving advice to Timothy, whom he calls his own &s;on in the faith, takes pains to caution him again&s;t this error, by a&s;&s;uring him, that "God the Saviour, would have all men to be &s;aved;" that is, all people, nations, or cla&s;&s;es of men; intimat|ing, that as by the death of Chri&s;t, the <HI>Jews</HI> were put into a &s;alvable &s;tate, &s;o were the nations of the <HI>Gentiles</HI>; and that what&s;oever &s;piritual benefits, it was proper for them to preach to the <HI>one,</HI> is was proper for them to preach to the <HI>others</HI> al&s;o. "Whereunto," &s;ays he, the more effectually to confirm him in the faith,
<Q>I am ordained a Preacher, and an Apo&s;tle; I &s;peak the truth in Chri&s;t, and lie not; a teacher of the Gen|tiles in faith and verity.</Q>
&mdash;In conformity with which opinion, "I exhort," adds he,
<Q>that &s;upplica|tions, prayers, interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men, even for Kings, and for all that are in authority <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whenever any per&s;ons are put into a &s;alvable &s;tate, or may obtain mercy, if they repent and believe, as was the ca&s;e with tho&s;e men|tioned by the Apo&s;tle, they are the proper &s;ubjects of the prayers of their fellow men. But in all the prayers of meer men, who cannot look into the particular coun&s;els of God, as they relate to individuals, I conceive that the matter petitioned for, is to be re&s;igned to the deter|mination of the Divine Will; and therefore, although Saint Paul in|forms us, that all nations and cla&s;&s;es of men, being put into a &s;alvable &s;tate, are to be prayed for, yet it in no &s;ort follows from hence, that e|very individual per&s;on, will finally be &s;aved, any more than it does, that when worn with &s;ickne&s;s, we pray for health, we &s;hall mo&s;t cer|tainly be re&s;tored. And yet &s;uch a prayer may be very &s;criptural and proper. In evidence of which, only read the words of Chri&s;t, John xvii. 9. "I pray not for the world, but for them which thou ha&s;t given me." Our Saviour, in various parts of this chapter, utters expre&s;&s;ions in a manner, which would be very unbecoming <HI>us.</HI> He &s;peaks with autho|rity. He &s;eems in the text quoted, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a certain know|ledge of the future, and particular &s;tate of things. By this knowledge, he directs his petition; and well a&s;&s;ured, it was not a fact, that every individual per&s;on on earth would be &s;aved, he here mo&s;t fully expre&s;&s;es his a&s;&s;ent unto it, including in his interce&s;&s;ions, tho&s;e only who were given him out of the world, or did <HI>already,</HI> or might in <HI>future,</HI> believe in him, and keep his word; that is, all believers, and friends of God.&mdash;This alone is a &s;ufficient argument again&s;t the doctrine of Univer&s;al Salva|tion, for if there are any per&s;ons, who are not intere&s;ted in the inter|ce&s;&s;ions of the Saviour, but for whom he even refu&s;es to plead, what po&s;&s;ibility is there, that they will be &s;aved?</NOTE>:</Q>
which he thus enforces,
<Q>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who gave him&s;elf
<PB N="7" REF="017524_0006_0FA12B66B2F7E9A0">
a ran&s;om for all,</Q>
even for Gentiles as well as Jews, "to be te&s;tified," or proved, "in due time;" which was in part <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church, by the power of God, among the Gentile nations, and will be fully done, when, with the pre&s;ent unbelieving Jews, the fulne&s;s of the Gentiles will be brought in.&mdash; The argument in the words, "For there is one God," &amp;c. appears to be this, That the univer&s;ality of God's government and dominion over all people, made it ra|tional to &s;uppo&s;e, that his beneficence and mercy was equally exten&s;ive; and therefore that his Son was not &s;ent to be a Mediator for the Jews only, but al&s;o for the Gentiles, or all nations what&s;oever:&mdash;Which argu|ment, as it was intended to refute the contracted ideas of the Jews, who con&s;idered Chri&s;t as a Saviour to them alone, &s;o al&s;o it was equally oppo&s;ed to the opinion of the idolatrous nations, who con&s;idered the God of the Jews, as having no dominion over, or concern about <HI>them</HI>; which opinion it was very needful to remove, as being utterly again&s;t the doctrine the Apo&s;tle de&s;ired to inculcate, re&s;pecting the extent of the benefits re&s;ulting from the mediator&s;hip of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>A particular attention is paid by Mr. White, the fir&s;t and principal author introduced by the compiler, to 1 Tim. iv. 10.
<Q>The living God, who is the Saviour of all men, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that believe.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017524_0007_0FA12B689F7F6A60">It is ob&s;erved by &s;everal writers, that the original word here tran&s;lated <HI>Saviour,</HI> equally &s;ignifies, and is very often u&s;ed for <HI>Pre&s;erver</HI>;&mdash;that the Apo&s;tle Paul, in order to encourage Timothy while encountering the labours and reproaches he met with in his mini&s;terial office, puts him in mind of that &s;ub&s;tantial &s;upport which always aro&s;e from tru&s;ting in God, who was the Saviour, or Pre&s;erver of all men, but who&s;e pre&s;erving care was more e&s;pecially extended into true believers.</P>
<P>But not to in&s;i&s;t on this; it is readily admitted, that although Chri&s;t be more emphatically the Saviour of believers than others, yet there is a &s;en&s;e, in which he may be &s;aid to be the Saviour of all men, implying every individual per&s;on, but this very different from the one, which tho&s;e who hold to the doctrine of Uni|ver&s;al Salvation, exhibit to us.
<Q>If any man &s;in we have an advocate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous, who is the propitiation for our &s;ins, and not for ours only, but for the &s;ins of the whole world.</Q>
Or, Titus ii. 11. according to the offered tran&s;lation,
<Q>the grace of God, which bringeth Sal|vation to all men, hath appeared.</Q></P>
<P>The language of the Go&s;pel is,
<Q>Who&s;oever be|lieveth, may be &s;aved;&mdash;Who&s;oever will, may drink of the waters of life freely: For he that com|eth unto Chri&s;t &s;hall in no wi&s;e be ca&s;t out, but in every nation, he that feareth God, and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted with him.</Q>
In con&s;e|quence of the obedience and death of Chri&s;t, there is a general proclamation made&mdash;pardon is offered unto all men&mdash;"the &s;in of the world is taken away;" that is, this great ob&s;tacle, which de&s;erves the wrath of God, is declared to be &s;o &s;et a&s;ide, as that he who repents of ini|quity, or, in a &s;criptural &s;en&s;e, is an accepter of mer|cy, may enter Heaven, and enjoy his Maker, as though he had never &s;inned. The choice is left with man.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="017524_0008_0FA12B68F0F5BCB8">I pre&s;ume this truth will not be doubted. Now ac|cording to the expre&s;s word of God, it is plain, that mercy cannot be granted without an atonement; and where it cannot be granted, it &s;urely cannot be offered; and therefore an offer of mercy &s;o compleat and uni|ver&s;al as has been mentioned, mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e an atone|ment equally compleat, and &s;ufficient for the &s;alvation of the whole world.</P>
<P>Should any doubts ari&s;e re&s;pecting this point, let it be con&s;idered, that the per&s;on who made atonement, is the Son of God, and repre&s;ented in the &s;cripture, as be|ing the greate&s;t price, or gift, which the Father had to be&s;tow on mankind: From whence it follows, that if this atonement be not equal to what has ju&s;t been &s;up|po&s;ed, it is impo&s;&s;ible with God, out of all his trea|&s;ures, to offer any that &s;hould.</P>
<P>A certain per&s;on comes to me at a time, when by &s;ome misfortune, I have ruined my affairs, and lo&s;t my <HI>all.</HI> He tells me, he is &s;en&s;ible of my nece&s;&s;ity, and has brought me relief. Only con&s;ent, &s;ays he, to ac|cept of it&mdash;acknowledge the gift, and it is yours. Now while it is at my own option, and in my power, to pro|cure happine&s;s to my&s;elf, by this per&s;on, may I not con&s;ider him as my deliverer, and friend? Ju&s;t in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, is Chri&s;t the friend and deliverer of all man|kind.&mdash;But are we to conclude, becau&s;e the atonement of our Saviour has opened the way for the offer of mercy unto all men, that it will be <HI>accepted</HI> by all? Or becau&s;e Chri&s;t Je&s;us has brought pardon, life, and im|mortality to every man, that for a certainty, every man will <HI>receive</HI> it? When it is &s;aid therefore, that
<Q>Je&s;us gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for <HI>all,</HI> and was a propitiation for the &s;ins of the whole world, or ta&s;ted death for every man,</Q>
the prepo&s;ition <HI>for,</HI> and the <HI>univer&s;ality</HI> contained in the whole words taken together, have in view the univer&s;al offer of mercy which is made to
<PB N="10" REF="017524_0009_0FA12B69B04C5D58">
mankind, or the &s;alvable &s;tate which men are put into, in con&s;equence of Chri&s;t's death, without any reference to the effects or con&s;equences which this offer will have; for this is a wholly di&s;tinct thing.</P>
<P>Further, it is not only true that Chri&s;t is a ran&s;om and propitiatory &s;acrifice for all men, including every individual, becau&s;e through him they are the &s;ubjects of offered mercy, but in addition to this, there are &s;ome ble&s;&s;ings, which every per&s;on on earth, does in a po&s;i|tive manner enjoy, and which are to be attributed &s;olely to what he has &s;uffered and done. This appears thus:&mdash; The de&s;ert of <HI>&s;in</HI> is <HI>death,</HI> in its comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e. When our fir&s;t parents &s;inned, by eating the forbidden fruit, they in a &s;en&s;e died immediately; for with re&s;pect to &s;piritual death, they lo&s;t the image of God; added to this, their bodies were brought into a <HI>corruptible, mortal</HI> condition from that moment. The ground of their enjoyment of any earthly comfort in this &s;tate of exi&s;tence afterwards, was the introduction of the &s;cheme of redemption, which had already been devi&s;ed,&mdash;the effects of which, began now to operate. And this is the rea&s;on of each per&s;on's continuance in the pre&s;ent world, and his participation of any ble&s;&s;ing what&s;oever, but the &s;malle&s;t portion of time, after he has been the &s;ubject of one &s;inful volition.&mdash;Immediately on the fall of Adam, the whole world was put under the me|diatorial government;&mdash;agreeably to the de&s;igns of this government, we enter life&mdash;enjoy the comforts which the world affords&mdash;our food and raiment&mdash;our friends, and all our ble&s;&s;ings. Every &s;ingle gift is the fruit, or con&s;equence of Chri&s;t's obedience and death; the whole which happens to us, being intended as the means to accompli&s;h the va&s;t purpo&s;es of the mediato|rial work.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="017524_0010_0FA12B6A6EE29FE0">We &s;ee then in what &s;en&s;e it may be &s;aid that Chri&s;t is the Saviour of the whole world, and yet this afford|ing no manner of proof, that all men will finally be happy.</P>
<P>I proceed to the con&s;ideration of two other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, introduced by the &s;ame author in behalf of his favourite &s;cheme.
<Q>That in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times, he might gather together in one, all things in Chri&s;t, both which are in Heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</Q>
Eph. i. 10.&mdash;
<Q>And having made peace, through the blood of his cro&s;s, by him to reconcile all things to him&s;elf, by him, I &s;ay, whether they be things on earth, or things in Heaven.</Q>
Col. i. 20.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of the Apo&s;tle in the&s;e chapters, &s;eems to be, to communicate to the Colo&s;&s;ian and Ephe&s;ian churches, tho&s;e honourable ideas, which it was their duty, and would be their intere&s;t to form, concerning the greatne&s;s of that Saviour, who&s;e name they had &s;o lately profe&s;&s;ed. In doing this, he repre&s;ents him un|der the&s;e principal characters&mdash;as the creator of all things which were created in Heaven and earth&mdash;the upholder of all things upheld, and the reconciler of all things reconciled; that is, in &s;um, the great agent in the <HI>whole,</HI> unto whom all the work, included in each of the&s;e articles belonged, and by whom it was all performed.</P>
<P>The argument contained in Mr. White's ob&s;ervati|ons, is, that the words <HI>all things</HI> are <HI>univer&s;al</HI> in their &s;ignification, and therefore that <HI>all men,</HI> and every indi|vidual, mu&s;t naturally be included in them. In an&s;wer to which, it may be ob&s;erved, that if we con&s;ider the expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>gathering together in one,</HI> and <HI>reconciling,</HI> to imply, the reducing from a &s;tate of moral <HI>di&s;order</HI> to <HI>or|der,</HI> or <HI>enmity</HI> to <HI>love,</HI> it is certain, that the words <HI>all
<PB N="12" REF="017524_0011_0FA12B6B2FECB510">
things,</HI> cannot imply an <HI>entire univer&s;ality,</HI> becau&s;e with re&s;pect to the things in <HI>Heaven,</HI> the holy Angels, who have never &s;inned, are in no propriety of &s;peech, the &s;ubjects of &s;uch change and reconciliation; and thus the idea of <HI>univer&s;ality</HI> is infringed on. The que&s;tion then is, if in <HI>one</HI> ca&s;e the idea of univer&s;ality mu&s;t be given up, why not al&s;o in the <HI>other?</HI> If the words are &s;o re&s;tricted in their &s;ignification, as that with re&s;pect to the things in <HI>Heaven,</HI> they do not contain univer&s;ality, why &s;hould they be &s;uppo&s;ed to contain univer&s;ality, with re&s;pect to the things on <HI>earth?</HI></P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle Paul is here di&s;cour&s;ing of Chri&s;t and the Church. By the things brought into a &s;tate of <HI>union</HI> and <HI>reconciliation,</HI> it is therefore in no degree un|natural to &s;uppo&s;e he intended <HI>the whole redeemed Church,</HI> not only compo&s;ed of the &s;aints on earth, but al&s;o of the &s;aints in Heaven, who had lived before the crucifixion of Chri&s;t, and &s;hould be &s;aved equally with the others; the words <HI>all things,</HI> plainly referring to the <HI>whole</HI> which was included under the denomination of what he was then &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>And there are various pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture in which the like general expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed, when at the &s;ame time, it is well known that a certain limitation is &s;up|po&s;ed. In the 9th ch. Exodus and 6th ver&s;e, we are informed, that "all the cattle of Egypt died:" Yet in the 20th ver&s;e of the &s;ame chapter, it is &s;aid, that
<Q>he that feared the Lord, among&s;t the &s;ervants of Pha|raoh, made his cattle flee into the hou&s;es;</Q>
which cattle did not die. In Job xx. 12. we read,
<Q>Man lieth down, and ri&s;eth not again 'till the Heavens be no more: They &s;hall not awake, nor be rai&s;ed out of their &s;leep.</Q>
It is however expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid in Matth. xxvii. 52, 53 that at the crucifixion of our Saviour,
<Q>the graves were opened, and many bodies of &s;aints
<PB N="13" REF="017524_0012_0FA12B6BEFEFBA80">
which &s;lept aro&s;e, and came out of the graves after his re&s;urrection, and went into the Holy city, and appeared unto many.</Q>
In the epi&s;tle to the Ro|mans it is written,
<Q>By one man &s;in came into the world, and death by &s;in, and &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inned.</Q>
But <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elijah,</HI> were tran&s;lated to Heaven, without &s;eeing death.</P>
<P>Nor is it con&s;idered improper, but on the other hand, it is a licence always taken in language, to make u&s;e of expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>general import,</HI> which admit of &s;ome <HI>ex|ceptions</HI>; &s;ince, if the <HI>exceptions</HI> are fully known, or by any manner, particularly &s;pecified, the meaning of &s;uch general expre&s;&s;ions, is well a&s;certained, and the true de&s;ign of language, which is to communicate ideas, is adhered to, without the trouble, which a minute expla|nation would put us to, every time we write or &s;peak.</P>
<P>It is the opinion, however, of &s;everal writers, that the terms <HI>gather together in one, and reconcile,</HI> amount to more than the meerly bringing the &s;ubject &s;poken of into a &s;tate of <HI>friend&s;hip,</HI> from a &s;tate of <HI>enmity</HI>; and really refer to that condition of <HI>reconcileablene&s;s,</HI> which mankind in general, may be &s;aid to be in, &s;ince the blood of Chri&s;t is &s;ufficient for the &s;alvation of the whole world, and who&s;oever <HI>will</HI> may be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Others there are, who con&s;ider the meaning to be, that <HI>all things</HI> are actually &s;o <HI>gathered together into one, and reconciled,</HI> as that they are wre&s;ted from that di&s;|orderly &s;tate, into which they had been reduced by &s;in, and are now put under a fixed plan of mediatorial go|vernment; according to which, all events and things, even the different &s;tates of men, with re&s;pect to happi|ne&s;s, and mi&s;ery, in the pre&s;ent, and future world, will promote the purpo&s;es of God's glory, and be to his prai&s;e; agreeably to tho&s;e words in &s;acred writ,

In both of the&s;e interpretations, the univer&s;ality of the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>all things,</HI> is as fully admitted, as is contended for: So that on the whole, in what&s;oever &s;en&s;e we con|&s;ider the words <HI>gather together in one, and reconcile</HI>; and whether we allow the idea of <HI>univer&s;ality</HI> to belong to the term <HI>all things,</HI> or not, it appears that the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation, is by no means, nece&s;&s;arily im|plied, in either the <HI>one</HI> ca&s;e, or the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall make but one remark more on this point. That after the re&s;urrection of the dead, and appearance of the world before the judge, every true believer will be received into Heaven, and every unbeliever be ca&s;t into Hell, this Mr. White him&s;elf allows, although he &s;uppo&s;es the puni&s;hment to be but <HI>tempora|ry.</HI> It &s;eems his ideas are, that this puni&s;hment is <HI>di&s;|ciplinary,</HI> or the mean to be u&s;ed in accompli&s;hing the <HI>gathering together all things, or per&s;ons, into one,</HI> and ef|fecting their final &s;alvation;&mdash;moreover, that <HI>Hell</HI> is the place, in which this work is to be done, and that the period between the <HI>day of judgment,</HI> and what he calls the <HI>end,</HI> is the time allotted for the performance of it.</P>
<P>Now the Apo&s;tle Paul a&s;&s;ures us, that the <HI>gathering together in one, all things in Chri&s;t,</HI> is to be done
<Q>in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times,</Q>
which, without a critical con&s;ideration of the words, mu&s;t &s;urely be al|lowed to refer to <HI>the time particularly appointed by God, for the work of grace, and the go&s;pel to operate.</HI> This being the ca&s;e, it follows, from what our author him|&s;elf allows, that the &s;ea&s;on allotted for the puni&s;hment of &s;inners, is, at lea&s;t, a <HI>portion</HI> of <HI>the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times</HI>; and that the work of grace, is in <HI>part</HI> to be performed in <HI>Hell.</HI> But does it not appear a lit|tle

According to &s;uch a repre&s;entation, the &s;inner is &s;ent to Hell for his <HI>advantage,</HI> and Tophet was ordained of old, as the place in which the Almighty might exerci&s;e <HI>mercy</HI> on offenders, and not <HI>justice and judgment only.</HI> Let any one &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;k him&s;elf, whe|ther he can reconcile this, with the plain language of &s;acred writ?</P>
<P>The next pa&s;&s;age I &s;hall remark on, introduced by Mr. White, is Romans, v. from the 15th to the 19th ver&s;e.&mdash;
<Q>But not as the offence, &s;o al&s;o is the free gift: For if through the offence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one that &s;inned, &s;o is the gift: For the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto ju&s;tification. For if by one man's offence, death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall reign in life by one, Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even &s;o, by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men, unto ju&s;tification of life. For as by one man's di&s;obedience, many were made &s;inners, &s;o by the obedience of one, &s;hall many be made righteous.</Q></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t part of the&s;e words, by &s;everal ob&s;erva|tions therein contained, the evident de&s;ign is to prove the &s;tronger degree of willingne&s;s in God, that <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> &s;hould abound by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> than that <HI>&s;in</HI> and
<PB N="16" REF="017524_0015_0FA12B6E31537CB8">
<HI>evil,</HI> &s;hould abound through <HI>Adam.</HI> The principal part of them, &s;uppo&s;ed to favour the doctrine of Uni|ver&s;al Salvation, is,
<Q>as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even &s;o, by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men unto ju&s;tification of life.</Q></P>
<P>By the offence of <HI>one,</HI> &s;in was introduced into the world;&mdash;all the de&s;cendants of Adam have partook of his wicked nature, and judgment has come upon all men to condemnation. The point in&s;i&s;ted on by our author is, that the <HI>free gift</HI> is as univer&s;al as the <HI>judg|ment.</HI> This I think may readily be granted, and yet in no degree countenance his favourite &s;entiment. Adam, our fir&s;t parent, before he tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, was in a &s;tate of <HI>probation.</HI> He might have &s;ecured the divine fa|vour, if he had remained perfect. As by his eating the forbidden fruit, he fell, and this introduced &s;in among his de&s;cendants, who have fallen with him, a compleat lo&s;s of the right to <HI>life</HI> has followed;&mdash;the whole world has forfeited the privilege of being in a probationary condition, for judgment, which is the de&s;ert of &s;in, is come upon all men to condemnation. This is the con&s;equence of <HI>Adam</HI>'s offence. What then is the con&s;equence of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>?
<Q>The free gift is come upon all men unto ju&s;tification of life;</Q>
the natural explanation of which is, the free gift, or the grace of the go&s;pel, is come, or propo&s;ed unto all men, bringing with it <HI>ju&s;tification,</HI> which ju&s;tifi|cation produces, or ends in life: That is, as by the &s;in of <HI>Adam,</HI> which introduced &s;in among his de&s;cendants, <HI>all men</HI> have fallen from a &s;tate of probation, and are under condemnation, &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, the propo&s;al of grace and pardon, or the <HI>free gift,</HI> has come upon, or unto all;&mdash;who&s;oever <HI>will,</HI> may be &s;aved, being in fact put into an <HI>equal</HI> &s;tate of probation, and
<PB N="17" REF="017524_0016_0FA12B705C003298">
entitled to an <HI>equal</HI> privilege with <HI>that,</HI> which exi&s;ted before the fall, and any &s;tate of trial what&s;oever; or which would have exi&s;ted, if Adam had never &s;inned, and his po&s;terity had not joined in rebellion.</P>
<P>Thus is the free gift as <HI>univer&s;al</HI> as the judgment; for certainly the offer of mercy, may be called a <HI>free gift.</HI> It was e&s;&s;ential to our author's point, that he &s;hould di&s;prove it, and &s;how that by the free gift's com|ing upon, or unto all, was intended, not only that it was offered unto all men, but that it &s;hould finally, be univer&s;ally accepted. This would be difficult; for comparing &s;cripture with &s;cripture, the very contrary, is plainly intimated, in a very &s;triking pa&s;&s;age, among others, on this &s;ubject, by the &s;ame <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> to the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> who &s;peaking concerning his being &s;ent to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> &s;ays, that he
<Q>magnifies his office, if by any means, he may provoke to emulation them which are his fle&s;h, and might &s;ave SOME of them.</Q>
Al&s;o, from Gal. iii. 22.
<Q>But the &s;cripture hath included all under &s;in, that the promi&s;e,</Q>
viz. of <HI>pardon, life,</HI> and <HI>&s;alvation,</HI>
<Q>by faith of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, might be to them that BELIEVE.</Q></P>
<P>The next text which I &s;hall con&s;ider, is, Rev. v. 13.
<Q>And every creature which is in Heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ea, and all that are in them, heard I &s;aying, ble&s;&s;ing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever.</Q></P>
<P>The book of <HI>Revelation</HI> is a di&s;covery of the va&s;t works, and government of God, exhibited to us, not exactly according to the manner of their exi&s;tence, but in a figurative &s;tile, and by means of <HI>Hieroglyphics.</HI></P>
<P>In this chapter, the Lamb is repre&s;ented as coming, and taking the book, with the &s;even &s;eals, out of the right hand of him, that &s;at upon the throne. At &s;o
<PB N="18" REF="017524_0017_0FA12B70AC8B4260">
&s;olemn an event, a doxology, or hymn of prai&s;e, is rai&s;ed, fir&s;t of all by the church, or redeemed, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation. The angels are next repre&s;ented, as bearing their joy|ful part in the anthem, and ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and, &s;aying with a loud voice,
<Q>Worthy is the Lamb which was &s;lain, to receive power,</Q>
&amp;c. To heighten this <HI>a&s;cription,</HI>
<Q>every creature which is in Heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ea, and all that are in them,</Q>
are heard to &s;ay,
<Q>ble&s;&s;ing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever.</Q></P>
<P>We may con&s;ider the whole repre&s;entation thus: The fir&s;t and &s;econd doxology, is the real expre&s;&s;ion of the joy and rapture of the redeemed church, and angels in Heaven, when the Lamb comes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the book. But, as if this were not a &s;ufficient cele|bration of his prai&s;e at &s;uch an event, by a grand <HI>per|&s;onification,</HI> the third is exhibited as the echo of univer|&s;al nature, in which, for the period, every being in the univer&s;e, and the whole inanimate creation, is repre|&s;ented as al&s;o becoming <HI>vocal,</HI> and at once breaking out into <HI>that prai&s;e,</HI> which prai&s;e, as the P&s;almi&s;t tells us, is ever expre&s;&s;ed, though in &s;ilent language, by all the works of God.</P>
<P>There is a beautiful &s;imilitude between this part of the vi&s;ion of Saint John, and tho&s;e words of David, in which he calls upon all things to prai&s;e their Maker.
<Q>Prai&s;e him ye &s;un and moon: Prai&s;e him all ye &s;tars of light. Prai&s;e him ye dragons, and all deeps. Fire and hail, &s;now and vapour, &s;tormy wind; mountains and all hills, fruitful trees, and all cedars. Bea&s;ts and all cattle, creeping things, and flying fowl. Kings of the earth, and all people; prai&s;e ye the Lord.</Q>
And whereas in this <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> the whole crea|tion
<PB N="19" REF="017524_0018_0FA12B712CF913A8">
is invited to join in the hymn of prai&s;e,&mdash;in what the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> was witne&s;s to, the anthem is repre&s;ented as if really &s;ung, and the whole &s;y&s;tem of univer&s;al nature engaged in loud re&s;pon&s;es to the doxology of the re|deemed church, and the cele&s;tial angels.</P>
<P>I &s;hall proceed now to the con&s;ideration of the re|marks made on the quotation from the Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, taking al&s;o in view, the ob&s;ervations on Gen. iii. 15. concerning our Saviour's brui&s;ing the head of the &s;erpent.&mdash;
<Q>Then cometh the end, when he &s;hall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he &s;hall have put down all rule, and all authority and power. For he mu&s;t reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The la&s;t enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he &s;aith, all things are put under him, it is manife&s;t that he is excepted which did put all things under him. And when all things &s;hall be &s;ubdued unto him, then &s;hall the &s;on al&s;o him&s;elf be &s;ubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all,</Q>
1 Cor. xv. 24th. to 28th ver&s;e.</P>
<P>In the u&s;e which is made of the&s;e words, in defence of the doctrine of Univer&s;al Salvation, it might in the fir&s;t place, have been expected of the expo&s;itor, that, as being &s;o e&s;&s;ential to his point, he would have entered more particularly into the argument, to &s;how, that by our Saviour's vanqui&s;hing, or putting all enemies under his feet, and brui&s;ing the head of the &s;erpent, is not intended what is u&s;ually believed.</P>
<P>He might have been told, that the enemies of Chri&s;t are vanqui&s;hed, and the head of the &s;erpent brui&s;ed, when at the judgment day they are &s;ent into puni&s;hment, and all the plots devi&s;ed again&s;t the kingdom and in|tere&s;t of Chri&s;t, are wholly di&s;appointed, and even made the means of illu&s;trating his glory.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="017524_0019_0FA12B71F03E8660">But the vanqui&s;hment of God's enemies, according to his idea of it, is very different: It implies in it <HI>fa|vour</HI>: It is not a <HI>cur&s;e,</HI> but a <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI>: It con&s;i&s;ts in the be&s;towment of <HI>everla&s;ting happine&s;s.</HI> And if I under|&s;tand the argument rightly, it involves in it the idea of the &s;alvation of the <HI>devils,</HI> as well as <HI>wicked men.</HI></P>
<P>The que&s;tion now is, whether we mo&s;t accommodate our&s;elves to the common u&s;e and acceptation of lan|guage, in &s;aying, that when it was written, that our Saviour would &s;ubdue, or vanqui&s;h his enemies, it was hereby &s;ignified that he would be&s;tow on them <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>everla&s;ting gain,</HI> or in &s;aying, that this vanqui&s;h|ment implies, that they &s;hall be overtaken with <HI>di&s;ap|pointment di&s;grace</HI> and <HI>lo&s;s?</HI></P>
<P>Another particular which might have been expected from this writer, is, that he &s;hould have offered &s;ome kind of argument to &s;how, that the <HI>end,</HI> and <HI>delivery of the kingdom</HI> here &s;poken of, is not to be at the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t, and day of judgment, but at a future period.</P>
<P>On the truth of this &s;ingle article, I conceive that the rea&s;onings on this text, and indeed this whole &s;cheme of univer&s;al &s;alvation entirely depend; for as it is granted, that after the day of judgment, the wicked will be turned into <HI>Hell,</HI> to be puni&s;hed for a <HI>&s;ea&s;on,</HI> that is, 'till the <HI>end</HI> comes; if therefore, according to the &s;cripture account, the period of time emphatically &s;tiled the <HI>end,</HI> is to commence at the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t, or judgment day, I infer, that the doctrine of Univer&s;al Salvation, as thus exhibited to us, cannot be true, and that all the arguments brought in favour of it, are un&s;upported, and nothing to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle had, in the beginning of this chapter, been di&s;cour&s;ing of the general re&s;urrection of the dead, immediately preceding the judgment.
<Q>Then cometh the end, when he &s;hall have delivered up the king|dom
<PB N="21" REF="017524_0020_0FA12B72AE24FD00">
to God even the Father,</Q>
&amp;c. But when is this to be? After
<Q>he hath put all enemies under his feet.</Q>
And
<Q>the la&s;t enemy which &s;hall be de&s;troy|ed is death,</Q>
or ce&s;&s;ation of exi&s;tence, in a compleat &s;en&s;e: And therefore Saint Paul adds, in evident con|nection with the whole,
<Q>El&s;e what &s;hall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead ri&s;e not at all?</Q>
And in full a&s;&s;urance of his having proved his point, he &s;ubjoins,
<Q>Oh death! where is thy &s;ting? Oh grave! where is thy victory?</Q></P>
<P>Before our author could &s;uppo&s;e that he had gained any &s;trength from this whole quotation, it was nece&s;&s;a|ry it &s;hould appear, and it belonged to him to prove, that the de&s;truction of death here mentioned, has no reference at all to natural death, and the re&s;urrection. This he does not attempt, but allows in general, that according to his own interpretation of the words at large, the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>&s;econd death,</HI>
<Q>will be totally and ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed;</Q>
meaning by the <HI>fir&s;t death,</HI> the mortality of the body, or the ce&s;&s;ation of life and exi&s;tence; and by the <HI>&s;econd death,</HI> the exi&s;tence of &s;in, and the puni&s;hment of it. Indeed, the connection ob&s;ervable through the whole chapter, will not admit the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the Apo&s;tle's words have <HI>no relation</HI> to the <HI>fir&s;t death.</HI></P>
<P>It appears then, that the de&s;truction of death men|tioned in this quotation, is joined with the &s;ubjection of all things; each article, &s;pecified in the ver&s;es, be|ing repre&s;ented, as if belonging to <HI>one</HI> work and to take place at the <HI>&s;ame time</HI>;&mdash;the de&s;truction of death, ap|parently making a capital part in the victory which our Saviour is to obtain at the &s;ea&s;on de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>If then, by the&s;e words, <HI>the la&s;t enemy which &s;hall be de&s;troyed is death,</HI> the Apo&s;tle refers, though it be but in part, to <HI>natural death,</HI> and the <HI>re&s;urrection,</HI> does it not plainly follow, if we would pre&s;erve any <HI>beauty,</HI> and
<PB N="22" REF="017524_0021_0FA12B736D0C5558">
union, among the parts of the de&s;cription, in the whole ver&s;es quoted, that the <HI>end,</HI> and <HI>&s;ubjection of all things, and delivery of the kingdom,</HI> will exi&s;t at the <HI>re&s;urrection of the dead,</HI> or <HI>general judgment</HI> immediately following. For &s;uppo&s;ing, as this writer does, that the de&s;truction of death, the la&s;t enemy to be de&s;troyed, includes in it, both <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral death,</HI> and that the former will be entirely de&s;troyed at the re&s;urrection, but the latter, not until a <HI>long</HI> or <HI>unknown period</HI> afterwards, in this ca&s;e there is evidently a <HI>di&s;member&s;hip</HI> in the parts of the de&s;cription&mdash;<HI>two</HI> periods of time are introduced toge|ther, where there is only the appearance of <HI>one,</HI> and the harmony of the <HI>whole</HI> is broken.&mdash;I cannot therefore conceive, that there is any other method to do ju&s;tice to the Apo&s;tle's words, and the arrangement of his ideas throughout this chapter, than by believing that the <HI>whole de&s;truction</HI> he refers to, is in fact to be performed at the re&s;urrection of the dead, and appearance of Chri&s;t to judge the world.</P>
<P>In further confirmation of this truth, and as an evi|dence that the end and re&s;ignation of the mediatorial kingdom, will commence at the appearance of Chri&s;t, on the re&s;urrection day, we may con&s;ider tho&s;e words in Acts iii. 21.
<Q>Whom the Heaven mu&s;t receive, until the times of re&s;titution of all things.</Q>
&mdash;It will readily be granted, I imagine, that the <HI>times,</HI> or <HI>time</HI> of <HI>re&s;titu|tion of all things,</HI> and the <HI>end,</HI> and <HI>re&s;ignation of the medi|atorial kingdom,</HI> are one and the &s;ame: And therefore, if the re&s;titution of all things, will be at the re&s;urrection, that the <HI>end,</HI> and <HI>delivery of the kingdom</HI> will al&s;o. What then is the idea contained in the declaration, that the Heaven will receive our Saviour until the re&s;tituti|on of all things? I an&s;wer, it is this&mdash;that he will never be again &s;een by the world, or make his appearance to men&punc; until that important &s;ea&s;on.
<Q>Whom the Heaven mu&s;t receive until the times of re&s;titution of all
<PB N="23" REF="017524_0022_0FA12B7433BFE8D8">
things.</Q>
But the Heaven will mo&s;t certainly receive him <HI>after</HI> the re&s;titution of all things, as well as <HI>before.</HI> There &s;eems therefore, to be no circum&s;tance to &s;et in oppo&s;ition to the idea already mentioned, viz. that our Saviour will remain in the Heaven, until the time of re&s;titution referred to. And while this interpretation of the words appears rational and ea&s;y, it has al&s;o the very great advantage, of being the mo&s;t conformable to the general language of &s;cripture, which often expre&s;&s;ly makes mention of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> appearance of our Saviour, which is to be at the re&s;urrection and judgment day, but makes no mention of <HI>any,</HI> which is called a <HI>third</HI> ap|pearance.</P>
<P>On the whole then, it appears, that all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, are <HI>again&s;t</HI> the doctrine of Univer&s;al Sal|vation: For if the <HI>re&s;titution of all things,</HI> and the <HI>end,</HI> and <HI>re&s;ignation of the mediatorial kingdom,</HI> will be at the appearance of Chri&s;t at the re&s;urrection, at which ap|pearance, even our author allows, he will con&s;ign the wicked, though but for a &s;ea&s;on, to <HI>Hell,</HI> it follows, that all the hopes of re&s;toration to future favour and happine&s;s, will be entirely cut off, becau&s;e, when the mediatorial kingdom is ended, there can no longer, be any mercy be&s;towed on &s;inners, &s;ince all mercy is be|&s;towed for Chri&s;t's &s;ake: And by the mediatorial king|dom's being ended, is obviou&s;ly meant, that there is an ab&s;olute clo&s;e put to the period, wherein there is the la&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of a &s;ingle addition being made to the number of the redeemed, then exi&s;ting.</P>
<P>But I wi&s;h to rea&s;on a little further on this &s;ubject, and a&s;k, in what &s;en&s;e it is that <HI>Hell</HI> is to be a &s;tate of <HI>purification?</HI> for this is the idea which is offered to us concerning it, by the&s;e writers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In proof of this, I might refer the reader, to a number of pa&s;&s;a|ges in the &s;aid pamphlet. If the puni&s;hment of <HI>hell</HI> is to be,
<Q>in order that</Q>
the &s;ubjects of it, "may be made the willing people of God;" if they will not be
<Q>delivered from their &s;uffering, till this is effect|ed,</Q> or till their puni&s;hment &s;hall have produced a proper effect, or "burnt out &s;in and lu&s;t," certainly, if there be any meaning in words, the puni&s;hment of &s;inners in the other world, is to be <HI>purgative,</HI> and their dwelling-place, may be &s;trictly termed PURGATORY.</NOTE> Is the <HI>purification</HI> to
<PB N="24" REF="017524_0023_0FA12B74F0C79450">
be produced <HI>gradually?</HI> Then it &s;eems there is a holy and virtuous principle in &s;inners, which is capable of being wrought upon by <HI>puni&s;hment</HI>&mdash;which <HI>puni&s;hment,</HI> by the &s;uppo&s;ition, is to have very different effects than that which was once inflicted upon Pharaoh and his &s;er|vants, who&s;e hearts were thereby hardened. And may it not plainly be inferred from hence, that <HI>&s;inners</HI> and <HI>&s;aints</HI> on earth, are per&s;ons of the very &s;ame character; for there is no <HI>&s;aint,</HI> of whom more can be &s;aid, than that he is virtuous in <HI>part,</HI> or in <HI>a degree,</HI> and accord|ing to the po&s;ition, the &s;ame mu&s;t be allowed with re|&s;pect to <HI>&s;inners.</HI></P>
<P>Again, is this <HI>purification</HI> to be performed <HI>all at once,</HI> and when the <HI>end</HI> is come? If &s;o, it is evident that <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> will not be the means of it <HI>at all,</HI> for if this will have no influence of the kind at <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> neither can it have influence at <HI>la&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But pa&s;&s;ing by the con&s;ideration of the&s;e things, it is probable it will be allowed, that when any of mankind continue to be impenitent, and unbelievers, to the end of life, the puni&s;hment to be inflicted on them in <HI>Hell,</HI> will be done, in order to &s;atisfy, or manife&s;t the divine ju&s;tice; and, that in <HI>kind</HI> and <HI>degree,</HI> it will be &s;o pro|portioned, as to be the <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>full</HI> reward of &s;in. This indeed &s;eems to be the &s;entiment of Mr. White him&s;elf, in the pamphlet under con&s;ideration, who, notwith|&s;tanding he may, at the &s;ame time, con&s;ider future pu|ni&s;hment as <HI>purgative,</HI> or <HI>di&s;ciplinary,</HI> yet &s;ays, that the de&s;ign of God in this puni&s;hment of &s;in, is
<Q>to glorify his wrath again&s;t it, and his ju&s;tice al&s;o.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="017524_0024_0FA12B75AD718B80">Be this as it may, the &s;cripture is plainly deci&s;ive in the repre&s;entation of this fact. When the Lord &s;hall be revealed from Heaven in flaming fire, to take ven|geance on &s;inners, and con&s;ign them to future pu|ni&s;hment, his bu&s;ine&s;s, as we are informed, will be to <HI>reward their &s;in, and evil works</HI>: Whether therefore this puni&s;hment be con&s;idered as <HI>greater,</HI> or <HI>le&s;s</HI>&mdash;as <HI>eternal,</HI> or <HI>not eternal,</HI> it is certain, that it will be according to the full mea&s;ure of the demerit of &s;in; for the <HI>reward</HI> of &s;in, mu&s;t in the nature of things, have re&s;pect to the <HI>degree</HI> of it. It will be the execution of the threatning of God's word; or as it is called, the
<Q>recompence of the Lord</Q>
again&s;t the &s;inner, and the di&s;play of his <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> from which, as the &s;cripture a&s;&s;ures us, there can be no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping, until it be compleatly &s;a|tisfied, and the debt which is due to it be paid, to
<Q>the uttermo&s;t farthing.</Q></P>
<P>Let us now enquire what will be the con&s;equence, if it &s;hould even be allowed, that there will be &s;ome pe|riod of time hereafter, when it may be &s;aid, that &s;inners have &s;uffered a puni&s;hment wholly adequate to their crimes. It is this&mdash;that &s;uppo&s;ing they &s;hould after|wards be admitted into Heaven, it cannot be &s;aid, if we would give the word its <HI>comprehen&s;ive</HI> and <HI>entire</HI> meaning, that this is the work of <HI>&s;alvation.</HI> Are the <HI>holy Angels</HI> the &s;ubjects of <HI>&s;alvation.</HI> No. But why? They have never &s;inned, or merited <HI>evil. Salvation and redemption,</HI> in a <HI>full &s;criptural</HI> &s;en&s;e, imply deliverance from &s;ome <HI>de&s;erved evil.</HI> But if it be true, that the &s;in|ner has &s;uffered all the evil he has de&s;erved, the idea of <HI>deliverance</HI> and <HI>pardon,</HI> is at an end, for there remains nothing as the <HI>object</HI> of the&s;e things. He is in the &s;ame &s;ituation, as if he had ju&s;t begun to exi&s;t, and had not been the &s;ubject, either of a <HI>good,</HI> or <HI>bad</HI> volition. It may be &s;aid indeed, that it is by the <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> of God, he is admitted into Heaven, but it is not by <HI>grace:</HI> Nor
<PB N="26" REF="017524_0025_0FA12B769CD66688">
is there any &s;ort of nece&s;&s;ary connection implied between him and a <HI>Saviour,</HI> or any <HI>propitiatory &s;acrifice,</HI> or <HI>atone|ment.</HI></P>
<P>If then it be a <HI>revealed truth,</HI> that whenever &s;inners are puni&s;hed in the other world, it is in a <HI>degree,</HI> equal to the <HI>evil</HI> or <HI>demerit</HI> of &s;in, it is plainly to be inferred, that notwith&s;tanding the&s;e &s;everal writes on Univer&s;al Salvation, may profe&s;s to offer &s;alvation to all men, yet to tho&s;e who will thus be puni&s;hed in the other world, it is really not <HI>&s;alvation</HI> or <HI>redemption,</HI> in the <HI>full &s;crip|tural</HI> &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words, but meerly <HI>happine&s;s</HI> which they offer;&mdash;the idea of <HI>&s;alvation,</HI> to the &s;ubjects now made mention of, being wholly without <HI>foundation,</HI> and in truth, a manife&s;t <HI>incon&s;i&s;tency.</HI></P>
<P>Reflecting on the&s;e things, &s;hould it not occur to the compiler of the pamphlet pre&s;ented to us, and all tho&s;e who abet and encourage the &s;entiments it contains, that they are engaged in pre&s;enting to mankind, what is not to be found in the &s;acred volume&mdash;for which there appears to be no manner of <HI>permi&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>warrant</HI> from God:&mdash;If &s;o&mdash;then what Angel from on high, &s;hall at|tempt the work? Or what mortal on earth &s;hall pre|&s;ume to do it?&mdash;The obvious remark from the pre|ceding, is therefore by way of enquiry&mdash;Can that doc|trine be true, which offers to any <HI>cla&s;s,</HI> or <HI>number</HI> of men, <HI>eternal happine&s;s,</HI> but which is not to come to them through the channel of <HI>free grace,</HI> and <HI>pardoning love,</HI> exhibited in the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> nor for the <HI>Redeemer's &s;ake</HI>?</P>
<P>I beg the reader's patience to but one thing more in reply to the rea&s;oning of Mr. White, from the la&s;t quo|ted ver&s;es. It is this, When our Saviour was ari&s;en from the dead, and was about to leave the <HI>world,</HI> and a&s;cend to <HI>Heaven,</HI> he gives this &s;olemn commi&s;&s;ion to his di&s;ciples,
<Q>Go ye into the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature.</Q>
He immediately adds,
<Q>He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believ|eth
<PB N="27" REF="017524_0026_0FA12B787551F2B8">
not &s;hall be damned.</Q>
There follows not a &s;in|gle remark on this head. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of the whole.
<Q>He is taken up, and a cloud receives him from their &s;ight.</Q>
&mdash;If now the doctrine of Uni|ver&s;al Salvation be true&mdash;much more, if it be the glo|rious doctrine, which is intimated to us by Mr. White, is it probable, when our Saviour was ju&s;t parting with his friends and di&s;ciples&mdash;when he was no more to &s;peak to them in the body re&s;pecting it, and when it was of e&s;&s;ential importance that, through his words, they &s;hould form no incon&s;i&s;tent or di&s;honorary ideas,&mdash; is it probable, I a&s;k, that he would have made no men|tion of it? Is it probable, moreover, that he would have u&s;ed a mode of &s;peech which, allowing the doctrine to be true, may be con&s;trued like a &s;eeming intention to conceal it? And la&s;tly, is it probable, that he would have &s;o aranged his ideas and words, as to leave it, at lea&s;t very plau&s;ible, that he intended ab&s;olutely to deny it?</P>
<P>"He that believeth not, &s;hall be damned;" that is, as the&s;e gentlemen mu&s;t explain it, <HI>He that believeth not, &s;hall be puni&s;hed by a temporary damnation, but this &s;ucceeded by never ending &s;alvation.</HI> Although, therefore, there was &s;ome rea&s;on for the ob&s;ervation of our Sa|viour, "He that believeth not &s;hall be damned," yet, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, it would have been as true, and for any thing which appears to the contrary, there would have been as great, and greater rea&s;on for it, if the ob|&s;ervation had been exactly the rever&s;e, <HI>He that believeth not, &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> But if in the communication of hu|man ideas, and the common concerns of life, it would be thought <HI>intolerable,</HI> in &s;uch a manner, to confound the u&s;e of language, does it &s;eem rational to think, that the great light of the world, and teacher of men, would have thus &s;et us the example?</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="017524_0027_0FA12B78AE1D5FC8">It only remains now to an&s;wer Mr. Scott, another writer introduced by the compiler; and to con|&s;ider the ob&s;ervations he has made on the words <HI>eternal, everla&s;ting, for ever and ever.</HI> He remarks,
<Q>That he has not been able to find one &s;ingle text, in which this article of an eternal and endle&s;s mi&s;ery, is either ex|pre&s;sly affirmed, or nece&s;&s;arily implied:</Q>
and that,
<Q>the original words, both in the Hebrew and Greek, &s;ignify nothing more than an <HI>age,</HI> and in the plu|ral, <HI>ages,</HI> either longer or &s;horter, definite or inde|finite.</Q></P>
<P>In reply to which, I beg to ob&s;erve, that wherever the&s;e words are u&s;ed in the Old Te&s;tament, they denote the duration of the thing &s;poken of, as long as po&s;&s;ible, compared with the <HI>matter,</HI> or <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> unto which it &s;tands related or applies. The <HI>hills</HI> and <HI>mountains</HI> are called <HI>everla&s;ting</HI>; the meaning of which is, they are to continue as long as mountains can continue, compared with the &s;ubject unto which they apply, namely the <HI>earth</HI>; that is, they are to continue as long as the <HI>earth it&s;elf.</HI> In like manner, the <HI>Pa&s;&s;over</HI> is &s;aid to have been in&s;titut|ed among the I&s;raelites, as an ordinance <HI>for ever</HI>; that is, to exi&s;t as long as the oeconomy of that people con|tinued, which was e&s;&s;ential to the exi&s;tence of the Pa&s;&s;over. It is very obvious, therefore, that the words <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> and <HI>for ever,</HI> imply much more than what is expre&s;&s;ed, when we &s;ay of any thing, that it will con|tinue for <HI>ages,</HI> or <HI>ages of ages</HI>; for with re&s;pect to the mountains, this would be true, if they &s;hould abide even &s;ome thou&s;and years, but cea&s;e to exi&s;t, before the world was at an end: or if the Pa&s;&s;over &s;hould continue through a long number of generations, but become unob&s;erved before the oeconomy of the Jews was di&s;|&s;olved: Whereas, the particular idea pointed out, is in direct: <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> to this, or any other con&s;truction of the words, which excludes the certainty of the exi&s;tence
<PB N="29" REF="017524_0028_0FA12B796D9D1BD8">
of the thing &s;poken of, as long as the nature and cir|cum&s;tances of the &s;ubject, to which it &s;tands related, will po&s;&s;ibly admit.</P>
<P>Having now di&s;covered in what &s;en&s;e we are to con|&s;ider the words, <HI>everla&s;ting, eternal, for ever and ever,</HI> when applied to things belonging to the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> world, let it be enquired, how we are to con&s;ider them, when applied to things belonging to the <HI>next</HI>: I an&s;wer, in a &s;en&s;e admitting of perfect <HI>analogy</HI> in both ca&s;es. The hills, and mountains, are things belonging to <HI>this</HI> &s;tate of exi&s;tence. The happine&s;s of the &s;aints in Heaven, and the mi&s;ery of &s;inners in Hell, are things belonging to the <HI>future.</HI> As the mountains therefore are to en|dure <HI>for ever,</HI> that is, throughout the <HI>whole</HI> of <HI>this</HI> &s;tate of exi&s;tence, &s;o, the happine&s;s of the &s;aints in Heaven, and the puni&s;hment of &s;inners in Hell, are to endure, throughout the <HI>whole</HI> of the <HI>next</HI> &s;tate of exi&s;tence. In other words, as the duration of <HI>being,</HI> is to be <HI>compleat,</HI> and <HI>as long as po&s;&s;ible,</HI> in the <HI>one</HI> in&s;tance, in like man|ner, it is to be <HI>compleat,</HI> or <HI>as long as po&s;&s;ible,</HI> in the <HI>other.</HI> For if this be not the ca&s;e, the analogy, ju&s;t mentioned, and mo&s;t clearly ob&s;ervable, is broken through, and the expre&s;&s;ions, both in the Old and New Te&s;tament, which refer to future duration, are improperly u&s;ed, and in a manner, evidently calculated to mi&s;guide the mind of the reader.</P>
<P>Thus much has been ob&s;erved on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the original words, tran&s;lated, <HI>eternal, everla&s;ting, for ever and ever,</HI> imply no more than <HI>ages,</HI> and <HI>ages of ages,</HI> or excited no other ideas in the minds of tho&s;e who &s;poke the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> languages, than what <HI>we</HI> have annexed to the <HI>la&s;t</HI> of the&s;e words. But how does this appear to be the ca&s;e? If the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> language be &s;o much more copious, than either the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> or the <HI>Greek,</HI> as to admit the expre&s;&s;ions <HI>ever and ever,</HI> and al|&s;o <HI>ages of ages,</HI> yet what proof is this, that the original
<PB N="30" REF="017524_0029_0FA12B7A34822B50">
words did not excite the very &s;ame ideas in the minds of tho&s;e who &s;poke them, as <HI>we</HI> have when we u&s;e the <HI>former</HI> of the&s;e? more e&s;pecially when we add, that the&s;e words, both in the Hebrew and the Greek, as is univer&s;ally allowed, are the very fulle&s;t, which either of the&s;e languages contain, to expre&s;s what we intend, when we &s;ay, <HI>ever and ever.</HI> When we con&s;ider al&s;o, that they are the only original words made choice of to &s;ignify the proper eternity of God, and that the word in the New Te&s;tament, is oftner u&s;ed, when his own eternity is the &s;ubject treated of, than any other, is it in any degree probable, that out of all the languages he <HI>then had,</HI> or <HI>could have made,</HI> he would have cho&s;en, <HI>two,</HI> which did <HI>not</HI> do it? We may conclude, therefore, they really did, and that the declaration of God, re|&s;pecting his own eternity, is not, as the&s;e writers tell us, left wholly out of &s;acred writ; which opinion, more|over, is confirmed by this circum&s;tance, viz. that the tran&s;lators of both the original languages have rendered the words as mo&s;t fully expre&s;&s;ive of what is intended by <HI>eternal,</HI> or <HI>ever and ever.</HI> This was done fir&s;t in the <HI>Latin,</HI> and afterwards in the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and other living languages; and according to all probability, would not have been attempted, except from a knowledge, that the&s;e were the true ideas always annexed to them in the <HI>original</HI>; &s;ince e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t tran&s;|lations, the mi&s;take, or fraud, if there had been any, would have been &s;o liable to <HI>detection,</HI> as &s;carcely to have left a <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of &s;ecurity from it.</P>
<P>Surely al&s;o, it is a very melancholy idea, if there be no word in the Old and New Te&s;tament, or in the Hebrew or Greek, which a&s;&s;ures us of the <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> happine&s;s of the &s;aints in Heaven. We are told by the&s;e writers, that this would in fact be the ca&s;e, were it not that the words, <HI>incorruptible, indi&s;&s;oluble, immortal,</HI> not to <HI>die any more,</HI> are expre&s;s to this purpo&s;e. It may be remark|ed,
<PB N="31" REF="017524_0030_0FA12B7AF2568150">
however, that the following expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>their worm</HI> which <HI>dieth not;&mdash;the fire</HI> which <HI>is not quenched,</HI> are, by the&s;e &s;ame writers plainly <HI>denied</HI> to be &s;ignificant of eternal duration. And what is the meaning of the words, <HI>incorruptible, indi&s;&s;oluble, immortal?</HI> Certainly the whole which can be meant is, that the &s;ubjects &s;poken of <HI>&s;hall not die.</HI> It &s;eems then, that the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>&s;hall not die,</HI> may in <HI>one ca&s;e</HI> be con&s;idered as clearly &s;ignify|ing <HI>eternal duration,</HI> and in <HI>another,</HI> as con&s;i&s;tent with the ab&s;olute <HI>denial</HI> of it. Notwith&s;tanding then, that the words, <HI>incorruptible, indi&s;&s;oluble, immortal, not to die any more,</HI> do indeed evidently expre&s;s the eternal exi&s;tence of the righteous, yet it may be inferred, that all the&s;e writers, mu&s;t, by their own method of rea&s;oning, entire|ly renounce the idea. The &s;tate of facts therefore, ac|cording to the account given us, is ju&s;t this, that there is no <HI>one,</HI> or <HI>more</HI> words throughout the &s;acred volume of in&s;piration, which a&s;certain the certainty of any <HI>eter|nal duration</HI> what&s;oever; but every po&s;itive declara|tion re&s;pecting <HI>eternity,</HI> is entirely left out of this book.</P>
<P>But in what manner can the&s;e words,
<Q>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched,</Q>
and thrice &s;olemnly repeated, be con&s;idered as con&s;i&s;tent with the doctrine of Univer&s;al Salvation? The com|piler ob&s;erves, it is intimated by one and another of the beforementioned writers, that if they prove any thing, it is <HI>this</HI>&mdash;
<Q>That the torments of the wicked &s;hall la&s;t as long as their next &s;tate of exi&s;tence la&s;ts, without determining how long that &s;hall be;</Q>
that is to &s;ay, if they prove any thing, it is, that the wicked &s;hall en|dure puni&s;hment, 'till their next &s;tate of exi&s;tence be at an end. The con&s;equence of this is, that they mu&s;t be <HI>deprived</HI> of all &s;alvation; for there can be no <HI>&s;alvation,</HI> where there is no <HI>exi&s;tence.</HI> And thus the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation, in&s;tead of being <HI>proved,</HI> is by the
<PB N="32" REF="017524_0031_0FA12B7BAEEA96F0">
very e&s;pou&s;ers of it, ab&s;olutely <HI>denied.</HI>&mdash;This is plain rea&s;oning, as even the compiler mu&s;t allow;&mdash;unle&s;s, by the words, "their next &s;tate of exi&s;tence," he would refer merely to the &s;inner's &s;tate of pain and puni&s;h|ment;&mdash;which if he does, the interpretation of the text quoted, is exactly this&mdash;<HI>The wicked &s;hall be puni&s;hed, as long as they &s;hall be puni&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing more in the ob&s;ervation re&s;pecting the <HI>valley of Hinnom,</HI> than what is contained in the fore|going.&mdash;But as it has been judged proper to introduce the ver&s;e already con&s;idered, and thrice &s;olemnly repeat|ed by our Saviour, would it not have been as well, if the preceding ver&s;e, had been added al&s;o? And then the whole together would have read thus&mdash;
<Q>And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: It is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that NEVER SHALL BE QUENCHED: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off; it is better for thee to en|ter half into life, than having two feet, to be ca&s;t into Hell, into the fire that NEVER SHALL BE QUENCHED: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</Q>
Let any one calmly peru&s;e the whole together, and mu&s;t he not think that the idea of eternal, and never cea&s;ing puni&s;h|ment, is fully comprized, and that if the&s;e words do not comprize it, there is an impo&s;&s;ibility that any others ever &s;hould?</P>

<P>It is well known, that a beautiful object never appears with &s;uch con&s;picuous lu&s;tre, as when contra&s;ted with its <HI>oppo&s;ite.</HI> In even a piece of painting, &s;ome &s;hades are requi&s;ite to &s;et off the more &s;triking parts, which &s;hades alone, would be di&s;agreeable to the eye, but by a happy di&s;po&s;ition, they a&s;&s;i&s;t in forming a mo&s;t ad|mirable piece. May we not conclude, that when the great Ruler of Heaven and earth, permitted &s;in to come into exi&s;tence, the rea&s;on was, that it might &s;erve as a mean to give <HI>di&s;tinction</HI> to <HI>holine&s;s,</HI> and by the force of <HI>contra&s;t,</HI> illu&s;trate its beauty in a more &s;triking light.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the advantage which the exi&s;tence of &s;in has in rai&s;ing the lu&s;tre of its oppo&s;ite, there is <HI>one</HI> &s;pe|cies of love, which could not have been known at all without it; and this is, love to the <HI>unworthy,</HI> and to <HI>enemies,</HI> or what&s;oever is included under the head of <HI>pardoning love, free grace,</HI> and <HI>redemption,</HI> exhibited in the go&s;pel; which exhibition of the Deity is evidently repre&s;ented, as the greate&s;t and mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing that
<PB N="34" REF="017524_0033_0FA12B7D30AAE878">
ever exi&s;ted; in the making of which, the trea&s;ures of his <HI>wi&s;dom, power,</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> are &s;aid to be opened to our view, to the great wonder of the holy Angels.</P>
<P>What has been now ob&s;erved re&s;pects the <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> of &s;in: Next then; as to the <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> of it; it may in the fir&s;t place be noted, that as to the <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>&s;en&s;ative</HI> pain, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, which will hereafter be the portion of &s;inners, it is beyond the reach of man, to form any adequate, or particular ideas. We mu&s;t leave the di&s;covery of this, as al&s;o of the natural or &s;en&s;itive plea&s;ures, which the &s;aints will enjoy in Heaven, till we have done with the body. Where the &s;cripture mentions the&s;e things, it is in <HI>figurative,</HI> or <HI>metaphorical</HI> language. <HI>Heaven,</HI> is de&s;cri|bed as a <HI>city,</HI> the &s;treets and gates of which, are made of <HI>gold,</HI> and exqui&s;ite <HI>pearl</HI>: And <HI>Hell,</HI> as a place of fire and burning. If the <HI>one</HI> de&s;cription be <HI>figurative,</HI> the <HI>other</HI> may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>The principal idea conveyed to us in the&s;e repre&s;en|tations is, that the happine&s;s of the &s;aints, and mi&s;ery of &s;inners, and the means of promoting it, will be very great: But there is not the lea&s;t degree of probability, that like the operation of fire on the human body, the &s;en&s;itive pain of the wicked will be &s;uch, as to de&s;troy <HI>thought</HI> and <HI>reflection,</HI> any more than <HI>exi&s;tence</HI>: On the other hand, it is far more rational, and &s;criptural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the <HI>intellectual powers</HI> will be left in <HI>full force,</HI> and the <HI>moral affections</HI> be in <HI>con&s;tant action</HI>; and that, at lea&s;t <HI>one</HI> part of the unhappine&s;s of &s;inners, will con&s;i&s;t in <HI>the&s;e affections them&s;elves</HI>; &s;o that the pain and evil experienced by them, may truly be &s;aid to be the effect of a <HI>voluntary choice,</HI> and &s;uch as the exi&s;tence of <HI>contrary</HI> affections would de&s;troy. And indeed it may be judged, that this is the very <HI>chief</HI> part of the puni&s;h|ment of &s;in. The little we know of the unhappine&s;s attending the evil and di&s;cordant pa&s;&s;ions of men on
<PB N="35" REF="017524_0034_0FA12B7DEF72E578">
earth, may &s;erve, in &s;ome degree, to convince us, how va&s;tly more intolerable the angui&s;h will be, when the like pa&s;&s;ions &s;hall come into action, in the other world, without <HI>re&s;traint,</HI> and grow <HI>big,</HI> as we cannot now con|ceive of, and at the &s;ame time, be accompanied with that mortification and di&s;appointment, which, where there is no mean of gratification, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ac|company &s;in, and which the Diety will now &s;uffer to exi&s;t in full force, as its proper and de&s;erved recom|pence.</P>
<P>The &s;cripture warrants us to believe, that the future &s;tate and condition of &s;inners, will be open to the know|ledge or view of the inhabitants of Heaven. With re&s;pect therefore to the <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> of &s;in, I conceive the end, and advantage of it to be this, viz. as the <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> of &s;in, in any &s;tate, or degree of it, is adapted, by means of <HI>contra&s;t,</HI> to make a more exalted exhibition of the nature of holine&s;s, &s;o the exi&s;tence of it, while pro|ductive of the painful con&s;equences now de&s;cribed, and while it nature and tendency, and the manife&s;t anger of the Almighty again&s;t it, are thus di&s;played, will be par|ticularly adapted to, and by the wi&s;e direction of God, will in fact produce this effect in the &s;tronge&s;t manner: Moreover, as the permi&s;&s;ion, or exi&s;tence of &s;in, was e&s;&s;ential to the di&s;play of the <HI>pardoning</HI> love of God, or any knowledge, or idea of it, among created beings, in like manner the perception of its real tendency and con&s;equences, will greatly help to enlarge, and bright|en up the view thereof, to the great benefit, not of tho&s;e who are the &s;ubjects of future &s;in and puni&s;hment, but of the holy beings in Heaven: For by &s;uch a di&s;covery of the evil nature, and de&s;tructive tendency of &s;in, the &s;aints will di&s;cover more fully, what they are delivered from&mdash;they will di&s;cover the &s;en&s;e the Almighty has e&s;pecting the malignity of &s;in&mdash;they will di&s;cover what mu&s;t have been the &s;trength in that love in God, which
<PB N="36" REF="017524_0035_0FA12B7EB4963C08">
inclined him to pardon it in <HI>them</HI>: By &s;uch thoughts, the greatne&s;s of free grace will be enhanced&mdash;the atone|ment put on new glory&mdash;the crucified Saviour appear in charms more exqui&s;itely bright, and ravi&s;h his peo|ple's hearts:&mdash;The angels who are witne&s;&s;es to the&s;e things, will be lo&s;t in wonder&mdash;redeeming love be the object of all their thoughts, and "God be all in all."</P>
<P>From this view then, it &s;hould &s;eem that we are to con&s;ider the &s;tate of &s;inners, and their puni&s;hment in the other world, as a real <HI>good</HI> in the created &s;y&s;tem. And is not this the true light, in which it is con&s;idered in &s;acred writ? wherein we learn, that nothing is done by God, but for a valuable end.&mdash;He
<Q>overthrew Pharoah and his ho&s;t in the Red Sea; for his mercy endureth for ever.</Q>
And
<Q>&s;mote great Kings; for his mercy endureth for ever. And &s;lew famous Kings; for his mercy endureth for ever.</Q>
In the book of I&s;aiah, the &s;eraphims are repre&s;ented in a view of the judgments of God, to be executed on a &s;inful people, as crying unto one another&mdash;
<Q>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of ho&s;ts, the whole earth is full of his glory.</Q>
And in the Revelation made to John the Divine, after Babylon is de&s;cribed as being de&s;troy|ed, he
<Q>heard a voice of much people in Heaven, &s;aying, Halleluia. And her &s;moke ro&s;e up for ever and ever.</Q></P>
<P>In what manner now &s;hall we account for it, that the&s;e <HI>perfect,</HI> and <HI>benevolent</HI> beings, &s;hould be thus en|gaged in rendering prai&s;e to God, in the view of his judgments? for the <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> or <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> of created be|ings, cannot, in it&s;elf, that is, &s;eparate from the idea of its ends and effects, be an <HI>agreeable object</HI> to any <HI>be|nevolent, created</HI> mind, any more than to the mind of God, who, as we are told,
<Q>delighteth not in the death of the &s;inner;</Q>

virtuous manner, in which the&s;e heavenly and benevo|lent &s;pirits are employed. The only rational conclu&s;ion we can draw is, that in their e&s;timation, the judg|ments executed on &s;inners, are a <HI>good,</HI> becau&s;e they are among the means, by which, they became more fully acquainted with the character of that perfect Being&mdash;. the knowledge of which, is at the foundation of all their happine&s;s. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be ob&s;erved by the reader, that but little is &s;aid, re&s;pecting the di&s;play of God's <HI>power, truth,</HI> and <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> in the puni&s;hment of &s;inners; or of his <HI>a&s;&s;ertion of the rights of his government,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>Having thus con&s;idered the advantages re&s;ulting from puni&s;hment in a general view of it, let us next enquire in particular, how the matter &s;tands, with re&s;pect to <HI>eternal</HI> puni&s;hment.&mdash;It may be argued thus&mdash;The puni&s;hment of &s;inners, as appears from the foregoing, is <HI>one mean</HI> u&s;ed by the Deity, of more fully illu&s;trating the nature of holine&s;s, and his divine perfections,&mdash;the di&s;covery of which, is a &s;ource of joy to the church in Heaven, and in this re&s;pect, a <HI>good.</HI> Now if the puni&s;h|ment of &s;inners &s;hould ever <HI>cea&s;e,</HI> this <HI>mean</HI> of becom|ing acquainted with the perfections of God, would <HI>cea&s;e</HI> at the &s;ame time, and of cour&s;e the <HI>good</HI> re&s;ulting from it. But as it is not con&s;i&s;tent with the character of an infinitely good being, to &s;uffer <HI>any mean</HI> of <HI>good</HI> to <HI>cea&s;e,</HI> he will therefore never &s;uffer this to be the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the puni&s;hment of &s;inners, and con&s;e|quently this puni&s;hment will never <HI>cea&s;e,</HI> but be <HI>eternal.</HI> This may be called rational evidence, drawn from the argument of <HI>benevolence it&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="017524_0037_0FA12B802F21FE88">If it &s;hould be objected, that a long cour&s;e of puni&s;h|ment admitting <HI>end,</HI> will be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es mentioned, ina&s;much as it is in the power of God, to impre&s;s for ever on the <HI>memory</HI> of created be|ings, the ideas they have once received; I an&s;wer, that with re&s;pect to <HI>memory,</HI> or the impre&s;&s;ion made by any particular event, which is not to occur again, it is known by <HI>univer&s;al experience,</HI> that it gradually, decrea&s;es by <HI>time.</HI> The argument from <HI>experience</HI> therefore, is again&s;t this &s;uppo&s;ition. Added to this, it is very ob|&s;ervable, that in the communication of ideas to created beings, the Deity always has made u&s;e of means a|dapted to their nature. When he pardoned &s;in, he had a right to have done it, if it had plea&s;ed him, without an atonement, or the death of his beloved Son. But this important event was tran&s;acted as a mean, by which his &s;en&s;e of the great evil of &s;in might be com|municated; to the intent, that the greatne&s;s of his love in the pardon of it, might the more fully be di&s;played. If then in the communication of pardon and grace, &s;o important an <HI>event,</HI> and it&s;elf con&s;idered, &s;o great an <HI>evil</HI> as the <HI>death of Chri&s;t,</HI> mu&s;t be u&s;ed as the <HI>mean,</HI> &s;urely we cannot argue again&s;t either the <HI>propriety</HI> or <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of <HI>means,</HI> in <HI>other,</HI> or the <HI>like</HI> ca&s;es.&mdash;It is very ea&s;y to comprehend, that the puni&s;hment of &s;in|ners is admirably calculated to continue the exhibition which our Saviour's death made re&s;pecting the evil of &s;in, and the oppo&s;ition of the mind of God again&s;t it, by which exhibition the wonders of the atonement, and the work, of redemption and free grace, are &s;et off, to the greate&s;t advantage: And thus not only all the things in <HI>Heaven,</HI> but all the things in <HI>Hell,</HI> will in this &s;en&s;e, be tending towards the &s;ame point, and for ever adding &s;trength, though in a totally different manner, to the great work, which Je&s;us died to promote.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="017524_0038_0FA12B80EFD77790">The reader will here perhaps anticipate another &s;entiment of great importance. In every rational con|ception concerning future puni&s;hment, it is not only needful to contemplate it as a mean of <HI>good,</HI> but al&s;o to con&s;ider this <HI>good,</HI> or <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> as far greater, than the evil, or pain, contained in the puni&s;hment it&s;elf, and as con&s;piring, among other things, to produce the greate&s;t advantage of the created &s;y&s;tem at large, or all things taken together.&mdash;If in the &s;y&s;tem of intelligent, created being, and extending the idea throughout eternity, there will exi&s;t more <HI>evil</HI> or <HI>pain,</HI> than <HI>good</HI> or <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> it is mo&s;t certainly a melancholy &s;y&s;tem indeed. If there will exi&s;t <HI>more good</HI> than <HI>evil,</HI> but yet <HI>le&s;s good</HI> than <HI>might</HI> exi&s;t, in this ca&s;e, it is an <HI>imperfect</HI> &s;y&s;tem.

In &s;uch a view we may well join the cele&s;tial choir in the triumphant &s;ong,
<Q>Hallelujah, the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.</Q></P>
<P>The que&s;tion then is, in what manner &s;hall we, on the principles already mentioned, and by mean of <HI>&s;acred writ,</HI> be able to vindicate the &s;entiment, that the great|e&s;t good of the &s;y&s;tem will, on the whole exi&s;t, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e that by far the greate&s;t number of mankind will be &s;aved: For it is to <HI>&s;acred writ</HI> we mu&s;t have recour&s;e, in all our rea&s;onings and proofs, &s;ince it will be wholly in&s;ufficient to depend on human, conjecture.

&s;ame purpo&s;e. A di&s;cu&s;ion of each of the&s;e particulars, would be too lengthy for my pre&s;ent de&s;ign. Who|ever examines them thoroughly, and in all their con|nections, will, I pre&s;ume, find no rea&s;on to doubt, that they referred to the times in which they were &s;poken, or the &s;tate of things <HI>then</HI> exi&s;ting, or <HI>&s;imilar</HI> in kind, and of cour&s;e, that they are <HI>limited</HI> in their &s;ignification.</P>
<P>In the 13th chapter of Luke, our Saviour compares the kingdom of God, to a <HI>grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed,</HI> and al|&s;o to a portion of <HI>leaven.</HI> Immediately one &s;ays,
<Q>unto him, Lord, are there, few that be &s;aved?</Q>
Who the per&s;on was, or whether the que&s;tion was put with a friendly or unfriendly de&s;ign, we are not informed of. Our Saviour in reply bids him,
<Q>&s;trive to enter into the &s;trait gate,</Q>
which certainly <HI>many</HI> &s;hould fail of doing; but does not think proper to an&s;wer his enqui|ry. And why? The parable was &s;ufficient. As the grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed, which, when &s;owed, was the <HI>&s;malle&s;t</HI> of all &s;eeds, &s;hould in time grow to be the <HI>great|e&s;t tree</HI> of the kind, &s;o that the fowls of the air &s;hould find &s;helter in its branches:&mdash;And as the leaven, which at fir&s;t was <HI>hid,</HI> &s;hould in the end, leaven the <HI>whole meal</HI>; in like manner, the kingdom of God, or the mediatorial kingdom, which at the beginning, and when it was fir&s;t preached, was received by a very &s;mall number, compo&s;ing the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> &s;ectary in the world, &s;hall in the proper &s;ea&s;on, diffu&s;e its power and reli&s;h over the <HI>whole</HI> world, and triumph in every place, and be like the <HI>&s;tone,</HI> out without hands, de&s;cribed by the prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> and repre&s;enting this &s;ame kingdom, which at length became a <HI>great mountain,</HI> and filled the <HI>whole</HI> earth.</P>
<P>I humbly conceive there is abundant rea&s;on to ex|pect a glorious time before the end of the world, and general judgment, commonly called the <HI>Millennium,</HI> becau&s;e it is to la&s;t a thou&s;and years; at which time

the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, and holine&s;s univer&s;ally prevail.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, on which the proof of this depends, are &s;uch as the&s;e&mdash;
<Q>All the ends of the world &s;hall remember and turn unto the Lord: And all the kindreds of the nations &s;hall wor&s;hip before thee. P&s;al. xxii. 27. He &s;hall have dominion from &s;ea to &s;ea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. Yea all Kings &s;hall fall down before him: All nations &s;hall &s;erve him. They &s;hall fear thee, as long as the &s;un and moon endure, throughout all generations. His name &s;hall endure for ever: His name &s;hall be continued as long as the &s;un: And men &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in him; all nations &s;hall call him ble&s;&s;ed. P&s;al. lxxii. 5, 8, 11, 17. Every val|ley &s;hall be exalted, and every mountain and hill &s;hall be made low: And the crooked &s;hall be made &s;traight, and the rough places plain. And the glo|ry of the Lord &s;hall be revealed, and all fle&s;h &s;hall &s;ee it together: For the mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it. I&s;a. xl. 4, 5. Thy people al&s;o &s;hall be all righteous. I&s;a. lx. 21. They &s;hall all know the Lord from the lea&s;t of them to the greate&s;t. Jer. xxxi. 34. And they &s;hall beat their &s;words into plough|&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning-hooks. I&s;a. ii. 4.

They &s;hall not hurt, nor de&s;troy in all my holy mountain: For the earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the &s;ea. I&s;a. xi. 6, 9.

<P>It cannot be pre&s;umed that the&s;e things have already been accompli&s;hed. The &s;acred &s;criptures inform us of a certain time, when the kingdom of <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> which has exalted it&s;elf again&s;t the kingdom of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> will be de&s;troyed, and
<Q>Satan be bound a thou&s;and years, and be ca&s;t into the bottomle&s;s pit, and &s;hut up, that he deceive the nations no more, till the thou&s;and years be fulfilled.</Q>
This is the &s;ame period of time refer|red to in the beforementioned texts. That it will take place before the end of the world, is evident from the com|plexion of the whole account, and among others, from this circum&s;tance in particular, viz. that the nations of the earth, will then beat their <HI>&s;words</HI> into <HI>plough-&s;hares,</HI> and their <HI>&s;pears</HI> into <HI>pruning-hooks.</HI> It cannot con&s;i&s;tently be &s;uppo&s;ed that this will be done, after the earth is burned up with fire. And as a further proof that this &s;ea&s;on will be before the end of the world, or general judg|ment, we are informed that when Satan has been bound a thou&s;and years, during which time it is, that all this promi&s;ed peace and holine&s;s is to exi&s;t, he is immedi|ately afterwards to be
<Q>loo&s;ed a little &s;ea&s;on and go out to deceive the nations,</Q>
or people,
<Q>which are in the four quarters of the earth;</Q>
that is, the &s;ame nations with tho&s;e beforementioned, or their natural de&s;cendents; for what other can they be? The con&s;e|quence of the&s;e efforts of the deceiver, we are told, will be the prevalence of &s;in in &s;o great a degree, as that <HI>a part</HI> of the inhabitants of the earth, will ri&s;e up again&s;t the <HI>other part,</HI> and there will be the mo&s;t violent di&s;or|der and contention among them;&mdash;an event which cer|tainly cannot happen to the righteous after the day of judgment, &s;ince it is expre&s;&s;ly declared in &s;acred writ, that the appearance of Chri&s;t at that time, will bring to them everla&s;ting peace, and deliverance from all

In addition to this, according to the order of the &s;acred narration, the day of judgment is introduced as an event, which is to <HI>follow</HI> the convul&s;ion and di&s;|order now de&s;cribed; for after mention is made of the &s;ignal interpo&s;ition of Heaven in behalf of the &s;aints in this conte&s;t with the wicked, the very next ver&s;es in|form us of the appearance of the Judge&mdash;of the books being opened&mdash;the dead &s;tanding before him, and be|ing judged out of tho&s;e things written in the books, ac|cording to their works.</P>
<P>The &s;um of the whole &s;eems to be this&mdash;that prior to the &s;econd advent of our Saviour, the kingdom which he hath e&s;tabli&s;hed on earth, will become ex|ceeding great, and overturn the kingdoms of the world, and of Antichri&s;t, which are oppo&s;ed unto it;&mdash;that the glory of it will la&s;t a thou&s;and years, in which time holine&s;s, peace and joy, will prevail, over the whole earth, and continue to the end of the world; or as it is written in the 72d P&s;alm,
<Q>as long as the &s;un, and moon endure, throughout all generations,</Q>
except, that after the thou&s;and years are compleated, it will be partially interrupted for a little &s;ea&s;on, by numbers of per&s;ons becoming &s;o corrupt, as to ri&s;e up, and contend again&s;t the &s;aints&mdash;which conte&s;t will be decided by the interpo&s;ition of Heaven, and immediately followed by the re&s;urrection of the dead, and judgment of the whole world.</P>
<P>As to the commencement of the happy time we have been con&s;idering, it has already been hinted, and the &s;cripture makes it very evident, that it will be at the <HI>clo&s;e</HI> of the <HI>reign,</HI> or at the <HI>downfal</HI> of <HI>Antichri&s;t.</HI> There would be no difficulty in a&s;certaining this period with accuracy, if we knew when to date the <HI>beginning</HI> of his reign, for the whole of it together is to be <HI>a time, and times, and half a time,</HI> or twelve hundred years. As the <HI>ri&s;e</HI> of this kingdom was <HI>gradual,</HI> it is probable its <HI>fall</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="017524_0043_0FA12B84B64E9A68">
will be <HI>gradual</HI> al&s;o. The writers on prophecy are well agreed, that it will be &s;ome time about the <HI>two</HI> thou&s;andth year of the Chri&s;tian aera, and the <HI>&s;ix</HI> thou|&s;andth year, from the creation of the world.</P>
<P>In the beginning, the earth was peopled by two per|&s;ons only. Two thou&s;and years elap&s;ed before the flood; but a little part of the world was inhabited; the waters came, and de&s;troyed the whole, except Noah, and tho&s;e who were with him in the ark. By this &s;ingle family, the earth began to be peopled again; but even in our Saviour's time, only an inferior part of it was im|proved, and &s;ickne&s;s, pe&s;tilence, and war, had in the mean while, &s;wept off a va&s;t number of its inhabitants, and retarded the increa&s;e. It is but of late years that America, which is called the NEW WORLD, has been explored, before which time, it was occupied only by the Indians, thinly di&s;per&s;ed on the &s;ea &s;hore.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering now the va&s;t increa&s;e of inhabitants, which probably will take place in <HI>future,</HI> and the great number the whole earth will be capable of &s;upporting, when, as it may be expected in the Millenium,
<Q>the de|&s;ert will blo&s;om like a ro&s;e,</Q>
which number then ex|i&s;ting, is &s;aid, in the book of Revelation, to be,
<Q>as the &s;ands of the &s;ea,</Q>
there is no manner of difficulty in admitting the belief, that many more, it may be, as &s;ome writers have &s;uppo&s;ed, in even the proportion of many thou&s;ands to one, will live in this <HI>one la&s;t thou&s;and years,</HI> called the Millenium, than will live in the <HI>&s;ix thou&s;and</HI> preceeding: And as this will be a &s;tate of univer&s;al holine&s;s, and the falling away afterwards, will be but for a <HI>&s;hort &s;ea&s;on,</HI> and this only <HI>partial,</HI> even &s;up|po&s;ing almo&s;t the whole of tho&s;e to be lo&s;t who exi&s;ted prior to this time, it may notwith&s;tanding be the ca&s;e, that many more, and perhaps &s;ome thou&s;ands to one, will be <HI>&s;aved,</HI> than <HI>lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="017524_0044_0FA12B8571152F80">This &s;ubject is copious and grand. Can it be thought, when on account of the atonement made by Chri&s;t, the whole world has been put under his government, and given to his di&s;po&s;al, that in the clo&s;e of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, he will &s;uffer Satan, who has exalted him&s;elf again&s;t him, to collect into his own party, the <HI>majority</HI> of mankind? Can it be thought, that the number of the redeemed will be <HI>le&s;s</HI> than Chri&s;t him&s;elf, may be pre&s;umed to judge, to be the mo&s;t for his own honour? Is it not fit al&s;o, that the great work of man's &s;alvation, and the kingdom of our Saviour, &s;hould be done, and glorified, in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> world, in which it has been &s;et up, and oppo&s;ed, and thus Satan be conquered on his own a&s;&s;umed ground? And once more, may it not be ex|pected, that all this will be &s;o performed, and brought into readine&s;s, as that at the <HI>very fir&s;t general a&s;&s;embly</HI> of men and angels, and appearance of Chri&s;t, the whole work done by him, may be &s;een in perfect glory&mdash; every doubt be &s;atisfied, and every mind be &s;truck with awe?</P>
<P>To return now to the point with which I began:&mdash; as a &s;ummary view of the whole that has been ob&s;erv|ed re&s;pecting the doctrine of future puni&s;hment, and the permi&s;&s;ion of &s;in in the moral &s;y&s;tem, I beg the reader to take the following&mdash;that it is a mean of bring|ing the lu&s;tre of holine&s;s or virtue more fully into view, of explaining the nature of redeeming love, and more gloriou&s;ly illu&s;trating the character of the Deity:&mdash; That being in it&s;elf an <HI>evil,</HI> no greater degree of it will be &s;uffered to exi&s;t, than is nece&s;&s;ary to promote the&s;e purpo&s;es, or operate in &s;uch a manner, as that the bal|lance of <HI>good</HI> may be greater than without it, yea the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible: And further, that as in its nature it is a mean of this good, it will never be &s;uffered by God to cea&s;e, becau&s;e, if it did, the good thereby effected, would cea&s;e together with it.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="017524_0045_0FA12B862DF6F3D8">As explanatory of this, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be very conceivable, that the view of any moral object, is greatly heightened by a view of its oppo&s;ite. By the exi&s;tence of both <HI>&s;in</HI> and <HI>holine&s;s,</HI> in the other world, the total difference of their nature will be perceived: In proportion to the degree in which each of the&s;e will di&s;play its &s;trength, and act out in new force, the con|tra&s;t will become brighter and brighter&mdash;holine&s;s will appear in increa&s;ing beauty, and the character of the Mo&s;t High in glory, and in maje&s;ty, more divine. By &s;uch knowledge communicated, the Deity, as it were, will approach nearer and nearer to all the holy, and heavenly beings:&mdash;By &s;uch knowledge received, they will approach nearer and nearer unto <HI>him,</HI> and he be|come <HI>one</HI> with <HI>them,</HI> and they become <HI>one</HI> with <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>Thus will all things be rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to the great purpo&s;es of the Son of God, who&s;e atonement and bu&s;ine&s;s on earth, which in it&s;elf was &s;ufficient for the &s;alvation of the whole world, will be better reward|ed, than if every individual among men were &s;aved; and who&s;e victory and triumph over Satan; will be far more compleat, than if the &s;erpent had not &s;ucceeded in any of his temptations on earth, becau&s;e his very &s;ucce&s;s will be to his di&s;appointment, confu&s;ion, and &s;hame.</P>
<P>What unknown worlds of intelligent beings, will be brought into exi&s;tence, to behold the&s;e wonders, we cannot tell. But &s;urely if the end, and de&s;ign of all things, and among them, of the exi&s;tence of &s;in, and the puni&s;hment of it, <HI>be</HI> that the glory of the divine na|ture may be unfolded to the view of creatures, it be|comes us to rejoice. Does both the <HI>order</HI> and <HI>variety</HI> di&s;coverable in the <HI>natural world</HI> affect us with delight? Are we not only plea&s;ed with the cheering rays of each returning &s;un&mdash;the opening of the &s;pring, and the gentle fanning of the zephyrs, but do we &s;ometimes

<P>Such admiration then, be your employment, ye friends of Heaven and virtue,&mdash;ye people of the Mo&s;t High. Well did the Angels, at only the birth of Chri&s;t, fill the air with melody, while the wondering &s;hepherds heard,
<Q>Glory to God in the highe&s;t; and on earth peace; good-will towards men.</Q>
And could the laws of nature be di&s;pen&s;ed with in our favour, as they were in favour to the &s;hepherds, we &s;hould hear the&s;e cele&s;tial beings &s;till engaged in prai&s;e, and the hymn go round.

<P><PB N="48" REF="017524_0047_0FA12B87B1AA10C8">BEFORE I put a clo&s;e to this writing, I a&s;k the reader to indulge me in a few remarks, concerning the tendency of the pamphlet, lately publi&s;hed in favour of Univer&s;al Salvation.&mdash;As it con&s;i&s;ts of extracts from authors, who can give no account to men, being gone to render their account to an impartial Judge, the com|piler mu&s;t an&s;wer for them, who, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed would &s;end nothing to the <HI>pre&s;s,</HI> but what accorded with his own &s;entiments, and he would be willing to defend.</P>
<P>And without any exaggeration, the doctrine exhibited and recommended, is <HI>this</HI>&mdash;There is no crime whatever, which &s;hall exclude a man from Heaven;&mdash;let him live as he li&s;ts&mdash;let him be an enemy to the world&mdash;his coun|try&mdash;his friends&mdash;yea, and his own life;&mdash;let him de&s;pi&s;e the offered mercy of his Saviour, till death has taken him hence,&mdash;by the blood of this Saviour, he &s;hall be <HI>&s;aved</HI>: For although he be informed, that he mu&s;t endure the dreadful weight of a <HI>temporary</HI> puni&s;hment&mdash;yet as <HI>no temporary</HI> puni&s;hment, can bear any compari&s;on with <HI>everla&s;ting happine&s;s,</HI> which according to the &s;cheme propo&s;ed, is to follow, it &s;till remains, that all things taken into con&s;ideration, he &s;hall be a partaker of <HI>infinite bli&s;s,</HI> which the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree of ini|quity, or the mo&s;t horrid crimes, and un&s;ucceeded by a &s;ingle penitential thought through life, &s;hall not be able to deprive him of.</P>
<P>I have never yet heard, what amounts to but a to|lerable an&s;wer to an objection, which has often been made again&s;t this doctrine, viz. that its natural tenden|cy, in this degenerate world, is to encourage libertini&s;m &mdash;give the reins to corruption among all orders of men, both in public and private life, and
<Q>undermine religi|on at the very root.</Q>
&mdash;Whenever I perceive it to be greatly applauded and e&s;teemed, it brings to my mind, the following de&s;cription of I&s;aiah, concerning the chil|dren

<Q>Which &s;ay unto the Seers, See not; and to the Prophets, Prophe&s;y not unto us right things; &s;peak unto us &s;mooth things; prophe&s;y deceits: Get you out of the way; turn a&s;ide out of the path; cau&s;e the holy One of I&s;rael to cea&s;e from be|fore us.</Q></P>
<P>Indeed it &s;eems &s;trange, but according to this doc|trine it is equally true, that the language of God's word, and the addre&s;s of the Almighty to the very &s;ame cla&s;s and character of per&s;ons, &s;hould <HI>on the one &s;ide,</HI> be&mdash;If ye &s;in again&s;t me, ye &s;hall die:&mdash;If ye believe not, ye &s;hall not &s;ee life;&mdash;ye &s;hall drink of the wine of my wrath, and have your portion, where is the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s for ever.&mdash;<HI>And on the other &s;ide</HI>&mdash;If ye &s;in again&s;t me, and repent not in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, I will be your friend notwith&s;tanding;&mdash;I will never leave you, nor for&s;ake you&mdash;my mercy &s;hall reach you, even in hell, and cau&s;e you to rejoice in my &s;alvation: For if ye believe not in this world, ye &s;hall participate of everla&s;ting life, in the world to come.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the parts of this addre&s;s collectively,&mdash; where is the <HI>threatening?</HI> It is lo&s;t in the promi&s;e of <HI>good,</HI> which is far greater than the <HI>evil</HI> threatened; and in a complex view of the &s;ubject, there is in fact no &s;uch thing as a <HI>threatening</HI> again&s;t &s;inners, in the whole word of God.</P>
<P>It may be remarked further&mdash;on &s;uppo&s;ition the doctrine of Univer&s;al Salvation &s;hould not prove true, it is evident at fir&s;t thought, that the encouragement of it, may in the end, prove a mean of the lo&s;s of many &s;ouls, the blood of which mu&s;t be accounted for at the bar of God. For judging of human nature by its pre|&s;ent &s;tate, it will be in vain to deny, that while per&s;ons can comfort them&s;elves with the hopes of &s;o great a degree of bli&s;s, as is hereby promi&s;ed to them, and comparatively &s;o &s;mall an evil to precede, they will be

much more likely to indulge mental &s;ecurity, in re&s;pect to the important article of preparation for another world.&mdash;Admitting therefore, that there is only a <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> that the doctrine is an <HI>error,</HI>&mdash;and that the op|po&s;ite doctrine, which has been held by far the greate&s;t part of Prote&s;tant divines is the <HI>true one,</HI> ought not this very circum&s;tance to be con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient argu|ment for the exerci&s;e of the utmo&s;t caution, in the exhi|bition, and encouragement of it?

"Watchman! what of the night?" Every good &s;piritual guide of the flock of Chri&s;t, when he perceives danger near, immediately gives the alarm. "Watchman! what of the night?" It is as the language of the Almighty&mdash;as the voice of God, unto Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters. May it not be &s;u&s;pected, that he, who in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, does not di&s;charge this be|nevolent office, and lift up his voice again&s;t the doc|trine, is either in doubt whether it be <HI>true,</HI> or <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> or if not <HI>publicly,</HI> is <HI>&s;ecretly,</HI> its abettor, and friend?</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with a belief of its de&s;tructive tendency, I cannot help a&s;king, if it be not time for the friends of truth, in whatever &s;tation in life, &s;eriou&s;ly to realize the evil which has already appeared, and is &s;till like to flow

<HEAD>APPENDIX, In An&s;wer to a late Letter, entitled, DIVINE GLORY BROUGHT TO VIEW, In the FINAL SALVATION of all MEN. Addre&s;&s;ed to the Writer of this Pamphlet.</HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;uppo&s;ed by the author of this letter, that the writer of the foregoing &s;heets, believes that God earne&s;tly de&s;ires the &s;alvation of every indi|vidual of the human race, meaning by this de&s;ire, as he apparently explains it, not barely a plea&s;ure in the &s;alvation of his creatures, as an object in it&s;elf agree|able, which is readily allowed, but an ab&s;olute choice re&s;pecting the accompli&s;hment of the event, all things taken into con&s;ideration. To this it is re|plied, that the &s;uppo&s;ition is a mi&s;take. There is no &s;uch &s;entiment contained in the explanation given to 1 Tim. ii. 3. or in any page of the pamphlet; but the very contrary is mo&s;t clearly expre&s;&s;ed, e&s;pecially in the la&s;t part, wherein the de&s;ign of future puni&s;h|ment is con&s;idered. In evidence of which, the judg|ment of the reader is chearfully appealed to. The inference which this author draws from the &s;uppo&s;i|tion, and the con&s;equential incoherence he endeavours to point out, is therefore without foundation, and is &s;et a&s;ide. The ground of the mi&s;conception of this Gentleman &s;eems to be, that he has blended together in his own mind the interpretations of 1 Tim. ii. 3. and 1 Tim. iv. 10. as if they had been treated of as implying one and the &s;ame thing; whereas the for|mer is con&s;idered in a limited &s;en&s;e, and as de|&s;igned
<PB N="2" REF="017524_0052_0FA12B8B6D69FA00">
by the apo&s;tle to be an an&s;wer to the Jews, who were di&s;po&s;ed to believe that &s;alvation was to be confined to their own nation, excluding all other na|tions, people, or cla&s;&s;es of men.</P>
<P>As to the other particular objected again&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> that the atonement of Chri&s;t, is &s;ufficient for the &s;al|vation of all men, including every individual per&s;on, as the offer of &s;alvation to all men is a proof of, and yet that every individual per&s;on will not be &s;aved, an an&s;wer may already be found to it in this book. The de&s;ign of the atonement was, that the &s;alvation of &s;in|ful men, might appear to be a work of grace. In order to illu&s;trate this, Chri&s;t Je&s;us magnified the law, and made it honourable. This being done, the mercy of God, became as open to the whole world, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of it. The whole world was put under the Mediatorial government, in con&s;equence of which and as the means of furthering the de&s;igns of this go|vernment, it has come to pa&s;s, that every per&s;on on earth enjoys even his temporal benefits. Now, if the puni&s;hment of a certain number of men, who actual|ly will, and God foreknew would remain impeni|tent, will be for the be&s;t on the whole;&mdash;or, if in the way of vindictive ju&s;tice, the future manife&s;tation of the mind of the Deity, re&s;pecting the va&s;t evil of ne|glecting and trampling on divine grace, will be one mean, by which the greatne&s;s of this grace, and God's &s;en&s;e of its greatne&s;s, will be illu&s;trated, as the &s;crip|ture evidently affirms, how can it po&s;&s;ibly appear, as the writer of the letter intimates, that the doctrine of a compleat mediation or atonement, implies in it, that the de&s;ign of God, in &s;ending his Son into the world, is in a mea&s;ure di&s;appointed, and the &s;ucce&s;s of Chri&s;t in the Mediatorial undertaking, is fru&s;trated or di|mini&s;hed?&mdash;There is therefore no manner of rea|&s;on for the &s;uppo&s;ition, that "<HI>univer&s;al redemption,</HI>"
<PB N="3" REF="017524_0053_0FA12B8C312D4778">
or as it might perhaps be better expre&s;&s;ed, that <HI>uni|ver&s;al atonement</HI> "nece&s;&s;arily infers <HI>univer&s;al &s;alva|tion</HI>;" but the idea, that the atonement is &s;ufficiently full and compleat to an&s;wer a general offer of mercy, in con&s;equence of which atonement, the mercy of God is as readily opened to all men as to a number only, and which is the chief or &s;pecial &s;en&s;e in which, as allowed in the foregoing pamphlet, Chri&s;t died for every man,&mdash;this idea, it is in&s;i&s;ted on, is mo&s;t per|fectly reconcileable with the doctrine, that there will be &s;ome individuals, even all impenitent per&s;ons, and de&s;pi&s;ers of the go&s;pel grace, who will finally peri&s;h, and never enter heaven.</P>
<P>Were it needful to rea&s;on with this Gentleman on his own principle, which is, that <HI>univer&s;al atone|ment,</HI> in the exi&s;tence of which <HI>he</HI> believes, mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily infer <HI>univer&s;al &s;alvation</HI> or <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> or other|wi&s;e God is di&s;appointed in his benevolent wi&s;hes in &s;ending his Son into the world, it might be a&s;ked him how he accounts for the future, and va&s;t puni&s;hment, which he him&s;elf allows?

On the principles advanced in this pamphlet, no &s;uch di&s;ap|pointment is conceived of, and an an&s;wer is offered to every &s;uch objection again&s;t the doctrine of puni&s;h|ment.

with the very incoherence, which he imagines to be in the way of his opponent.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations of our author, in the beginning of his letter, re&s;pecting the wor&s;hip of the Deity, are rather too loo&s;e and exceptionable. Surely it is not peculiar to the Univer&s;ali&s;ts to
<Q>bow the knee to a being <HI>intrin&s;ically</HI> excellent, and who would be the admiration of all his creatures, even were guilt and &s;uffering bani&s;hed the creation.</Q>
It is enquired of him, how this <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> excellence of the Deity is to be <HI>known</HI> by creatures, except from the illu&s;trations of it by &s;ome <HI>means,</HI> or what may be called his <HI>works?</HI> The <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> excellence of God, is the very object to which the writer of this pamphlet would de&s;ire to lead the mind of the reader, the doctrine contained in it being this&mdash;that by all the works of the Deity, and by what already has, and will in future exi&s;t, the divine perfections, which con&s;titute this <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> ex|cellence, will be illu&s;trated in the be&s;t manner, and the God of glory, love and beauty, be mo&s;t perfectly di&s;covered to the intelligent, created &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The author of the letter under con&s;ideration, de|clares, that he is not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the reception which the foregoing &s;heets met with, "even from per|&s;ons who call them&s;elves CALVINISTS." The writer does not profe&s;s to have any claim upon the good opinion of others. If the pamphlet has met with their approbation in any degree, he would impute it to the ea&s;y evidence of the main doctrine, which by &s;acred writ, it profe&s;&s;es to maintain; and he &s;incerely wi&s;hes he had been much better able to do it ju&s;tice. Our author, however, would choo&s;e at le&s;t to put the per&s;ons referred to in mind, that in the article now mentioned, they are incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, for in the fir&s;t place, it is &s;ugge&s;ted, that the pamphlet is not <HI>Calvini&s;tick</HI>: and &s;econdly, it favours of <HI>Fatali&s;m.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="017524_0055_0FA12B8DAFD0D840">If it be not Calvini&s;tick, why &s;hould this gentle|man object to it on <HI>&s;uch</HI> an account? For according to <HI>his</HI> declared opinion, neither the Calvi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">s or Ar|minians, but the Univer&s;alli&s;ts only are con&s;i&s;tent. The book contains in it the doctrine of <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> or <HI>com|plete atonement.</HI> The Calvini&s;tick Divines, he a&s;&s;erts, deny the doctrine. The gentleman him&s;elf declared|ly believes it. Therefore <HI>beware of it, and avoid &s;o dangerous a book,</HI> is the inference and le&s;&s;on, which he draws and urges.</P>
<P>But after all this propo&s;ed cau<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">, it happens that the book, is much nearer to that by many Divines is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Calvini&s;m, than is &s;ugge&s;ted. Among the au|thors of this cla&s;s, which the writer of it has at pre|&s;ent by him, he can produce Poole, Burkitt, Henry, and Edwards, the la&s;t of whom is a well known Ame|rican, and New England defender of the Calvini&s;tick doctrines, who in the very article in which this pamph|let is declared by the letter writer to have departed from Calvini&s;m, are each of the &s;ame opinion, and profe&s;&s;edly believed that the atonement of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, was compleatly an&s;werable to the univer&s;al of|fer of mercy which has been made from Heaven, and yet that &s;ome men would peri&s;h for ever.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting the fear &s;ugge&s;ted, that the writer of this pamphlet is a <HI>Fatali&s;t,</HI> this al&s;o is foreign from the &s;ubject, and is liable to the &s;ame imputation of fault with the la&s;t particular adverted to, being a re|&s;emblance of that mode of conte&s;t often u&s;ed by Po|lemick writers, when they have been pre&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by various ob&s;tacles, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> found it difficult to de|fend a favourite &s;cheme. It is impo&s;&s;ible, that a per&s;on &s;hould believe in divine revelation, and be a <HI>Fatali&s;t.</HI> That men have "no will of their own," in the &s;en&s;e affixed to the expre&s;&s;ion, is not to be con|ceived of. Each per&s;on chu&s;es and refu&s;es, loves and

hates, and is con&s;cious of it. Should any one a&s;&s;ert, that men are not moral agents, it would be like a&s;|&s;erting that they have no &s;ouls. And by the way, e|qually ab&s;urd would it be, to rejoice in the prevalen|cy of wickedne&s;s, and commit &s;in on the pretext, that by the wi&s;e direction of God, it is made a mean, as the Apo&s;tle Paul a&s;&s;ures us, of the enhancing or a|bounding of grace. That &s;in &s;hould be over-ruled for this <HI>good,</HI> is indeed a proper matter of joy. But it is the <HI>good</HI> only, which is the &s;uppo&s;ed object of the joy, and this is a virtuous feeling. Sin is an evil in its own nature. To rejoice in it as &s;uch, is ab&s;olute|ly to reject and oppo&s;e the <HI>good</HI> or <HI>grace,</HI> which, not by men or angels, but by the power and wi&s;dom of God, to whom alone the work belongs, it is rendered a mean of illu&s;trating. The 6th chap. of Romans, is a complete an&s;wer to all that is contained in our author's letter on this matter.</P>
<P>On the whole, the &s;um of the doctrine contained in the foregoing &s;heets, as relating to the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed dif|ficulties, is as follows:&mdash;That in the government of God, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive view of it, there is a grand and glorious &s;cheme devi&s;ed, the object of which is on the whole the greate&s;t good&mdash;That all events will take place in corre&s;pondency with it, each one having an influence in its place, and becoming a mean of advancing its de&s;ired end&mdash;That for this rea&s;on, even the exi&s;tence of &s;in, among other things, was permit|ed, and the puni&s;hment of the ungodly will be exe|cuted&mdash;That man is a moral agent, and being &s;uch, is a proper &s;ubject of blame worthine&s;s when he &s;ins&mdash; And that the object of the Deity's mind, as to all e|vents which he permits, being to illu&s;trate his own glorious character, the contemplation of which is the &s;ource of the mo&s;t refined and exalted happine&s;s that can exi&s;t in the intelligent &s;y&s;tem, and which will ex|i&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="017524_0057_0FA12B9011EB43D8">
in the greate&s;t degree, therefore he is infinitely worthy the love and adoration of all intelligent crea|tures.</P>
<P>Now, is there any article here mentioned, which does not &s;et the character of the Almighty in an ho|nourable point of light? It is further a&s;ked, is there any one of the&s;e particulars which being denied, in|cludes not al&s;o an implicit denial of &s;ome perfection or other e&s;&s;ential to Jehovah?</P>
<P>As to the manner in which things come into ex|i&s;tence, or the &s;ubject of <HI>cau&s;e</HI> and <HI>effect,</HI> it was not the writer's de&s;ign to enter into the debate. The object of the Deity's mind, concerning the exi&s;tence of all events being declared in this pamphlet to be, in a univer&s;al &s;en&s;e, the greate&s;t good and glory, his moral character, is of cour&s;e, profe&s;&s;edly vindicated, for this is the point which a&s;certains it, and proves its excel|lency. With re&s;pect to the other particular, the wri|ter's firm belief is&mdash;That is the true &s;y&s;tem, be it which it will, that without impeaching what are called the <HI>moral</HI> attributes of God, maintain his <HI>natural</HI> attri|butes al&s;o, and not confounding the idea of his <HI>power</HI> and <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> honours and exalts his <HI>holine&s;s,</HI> and re|pre&s;ents him as all grand&mdash;all glorious&mdash;and all lovely.</P>
<P>Be this the object of our adoration! Be this the God we love! In regard to the author of the letter now replied to, although this Appendix bears the form of controver&s;y, the writer wi&s;hes him to accept his undi&s;&s;embling and fervent de&s;ire, that the &s;pirit of all truth may &s;o influence both their hearts, as that when the de&s;igns of the Mediatorial government &s;hall be di&s;played in inconceivable glory at the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t and the la&s;t great day, they may mutual|ly unite in wor&s;hipping the <HI>one true God,</HI> and join with the Prophets and Apo&s;tles&mdash;the &s;aints and angels, in &s;ublimely chanting his eternal prai&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017524_0058_0FA12B90AE03F010">And if, as Pope &s;ays, "Whatever is, is right&mdash;" much more, if, as the in&s;pired writers declare, all events will finally terminate in the mo&s;t exalted illu&s;|tration of the glory of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> then let it be the im|mediate language of every reader's mind, "Hallelu|jah! the Lord &s;itteth King for ever."</P>
