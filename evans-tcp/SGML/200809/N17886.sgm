<P>THE repeated events which have &s;hewn death to us in various forms, require a &s;olemn recollection of death from the pulpit. When we mourn the dome&s;tic bereavement, tho the grief be more pungent, yet &s;entiment will &s;upply our con&s;olations, and time renew our happy relations. When we lo&s;e the u&s;e|ful citizen&mdash;the friend of his neighbors, and of mankind&mdash;we may not &s;o readily
<PB N="4" REF="023177_0004_0FBDDC236B6F3B70">find our public lo&s;s compen&s;ated; tho we may not indulge our tears, or our out|ward expre&s;&s;ions of grief. Envy, or an ignorance of life, may repre&s;ent, that the place of the be&s;t may &s;oon be &s;upplied&mdash; that in&s;tead of the fathers are the child|ren &mdash;and that as &s;oon as one man is gone, another will ri&s;e up and take his place: but devotion has taught, in every age, to regret the ab&s;ence of the eminent men, who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the public &s;ervice of mankind; and political virtue has celebrated the charac|ters, who have conducted the important intere&s;ts of the world. To whatever cau&s;es we owe human greatne&s;s, we are not better in&s;tructed in the magnitudes of bodies, and their relative powers, than we are in the hi&s;tory of mankind, that the greate&s;t intere&s;ts have depended on the virtue, and generous exertions, of &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed names among men. Whether the character of an age, fal&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="023177_0005_0FBDDC24EE6D3930">attachments, or any ignoble cau&s;e, have increa&s;ed this influence, or not, it has been &s;acredly real, and truly happy. And we cannot forget the late worthy CAP|TAIN GARDNER. His character is the mo&s;t intere&s;ting to us, tho we were not honored by his pre&s;ence with us in our public wor&s;hip. His re&s;idence in our neighborhood, his exemplary virtues, and his u&s;efulne&s;s in the town&mdash;particu|larly his &s;tation, as a MASTER to one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting in&s;titutions for MA|RINERS &mdash;call upon &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly as this, in which the greater number are employed in navigation, to &s;ee a refuta|tion of all the charges which can be brought again&s;t the man of bu&s;ine&s;s and the &s;ea. His integrity was unimpeached; his aver&s;ion from profanity, &s;erious-; his private virtues, con&s;picuous; his zeal for his brethren of the &s;ea, unabated, amid&s;t all the neglects which in this town have remarkably attended their common in|tere&s;ts.
<PB N="6" REF="023177_0006_0FBDDC266BC46C08">Indeed, he was an example, in his whole character, worthy of the imit|ation of our mariners&mdash;not only in re|gard to civil and &s;ocial, but religious, in|&s;titutions. And to &s;uffer &s;uch a man to drop into the grave forgotten, would be|tray a criminal inattention to the means of virtue.</P>
<P>THE words read to us are the words of Job; and they accommodate them&s;elves very ea&s;ily to the con&s;ideration of that character, which our departed friend &s;u&s;|tained, as a benefactor and patron of an in&s;titution de&s;igned for the relief of di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed mariners and their families.</P>
<P>TO THE &s;uper&s;icial ob&s;erver, as well as the contemplative, of ancient times, the power and &s;overeignty of nature were vi&s;ible. The pre&s;ent life did not corre&s;|pond to a de&s;ign of immediate good to the individual, nor of an adequate ben|efit to the whole animal creation. The
<PB N="7" REF="023177_0007_0FBDDC27ECA5EE80">laws were not &s;uch as a limited &s;en&s;e of goodne&s;s might adopt. To exhibit this &s;entiment, was the de&s;ign of the book of Job. Its images di&s;cover it to be of ea&s;t|ern original: it has not the prejudices nor language of an Hebrew, and is not mentioned in their antient books: the pre&s;umption is, that it was unknown in antiquity, and was written by an ea&s;tern pen. The book &s;hews us approved in|tegrity, and happy &s;ucce&s;s, accompanied with the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing di&s;appointments. The raging winds, the treacherous Arab, and cruel di&s;ea&s;e, &s;eize together upon the man of virtue. His a&s;toni&s;hed friends, too apt to combine &s;ucce&s;s and virtue, cannot reconcile this &s;uffering to his in|nocence. They &s;u&s;pect the virtue they once applauded, and charge guilt upon the &s;ufferer. Con&s;cious of integrity, he ri&s;es in his defence. He carries them over nature, to &s;hew them the &s;overeignty of God. He wi&s;hes to expo&s;tulate with
<PB N="8" REF="023177_0008_0FBDDC296D801628">Heaven, and, as in our text, to awaken the &s;ame &s;ympathy in God, which he could provoke in man. But he recollects him|&s;elf: &mdash;The book of my years will &s;oon be fini&s;hed; and the Sovereignty which af|flicts me, will terminate my exi&s;tence.&mdash; But we pity the error of his friends. So &s;trongly had they a&s;&s;ociated &s;ucce&s;s with innocence, that they in&s;ulted innocence in its &s;uffering. The plea&s;ing e&s;teem they had entertained was lo&s;t, and the vigor of their affection abated. Often do we &s;ee the &s;ame effects &s;till more ungenerous, in an enlightened world.</P>
<P>BUT we &s;hould remember, that a too &s;trong &s;ympathy with mi&s;ery may lead into an oppo&s;ite extreme. Tho virtue may &s;uffer, yet virtue may &s;ecure &s;ucce&s;s. And if we con&s;ider the world as governed only by tho&s;e who are the lea&s;t de&s;erving, the contempt of &s;ucce&s;s may place us at variance with all the &s;cenery of human
<PB N="9" REF="023177_0009_0FBDDC2AE7F2BAF8">affairs, by de&s;pi&s;ing the rewards which a wi&s;e conduct may be&s;tow. The part a&s;|&s;igned to a benevolent mind, is, to fore|&s;ee the dangers of life, and to extend the means of relief; that no unhappy cir|cum&s;tances of action, or unfore&s;een e|vents, may depre&s;s the virtue which re|mains, or deprive of the mo&s;t &s;alutary con&s;olations, the men who have nobly dared to di&s;charge their duty. While we de&s;pi&s;e the in&s;olence of &s;ucce&s;sful villainy, let us encourage virtue in its riche&s;t gains: and while we ju&s;tify the mi&s;ery of vice, let us remember the mo&s;t humble condition of virtue.</P>
<P>LET us then, in the following di&s;|cour&s;e, con&s;ider the cau&s;es of human di&s;|tre&s;s, independent of per&s;onal merit; the di&s;po&s;ition to relieve, in human nature; and the ju&s;t improvement of the &s;hortne&s;s of life, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;ocial principle. The fir&s;t will &s;hew us the &s;overeignty of God:
<PB N="10" REF="023177_0010_0FBDDC2C6C142A18">the &s;econd, our happy relief; and the la&s;t, point out the happy u&s;e of riches, and a particular application.</P>
<P>UNDER the fir&s;t con&s;ideration, we may illu&s;trate the means of &s;ucce&s;s, and the cau&s;es of di&s;appointment. What we cannot rever&s;e in the decrees of Heaven, we may &s;hun by our knowledge of them. And the u&s;ual &s;ources of our pro&s;perity are in education, abilities, and &s;ecular in|tere&s;t. Whatever we a&s;&s;ign to abilities, or impute to intere&s;t, we mu&s;t allow that education produces the greate&s;t u&s;efalne&s;s and happine&s;s of character. By this, all u&s;eful habits are fixed, and the relations of life known. By it is not intended any particular opinions which we obtain in any &s;ociety, or the form in which we are in&s;tructed in the duties of life: the exer|ci&s;e of the bow is as real an education, as the learning of the &s;chool; and the mo&s;t humble &s;ociety is formed by it, as well as
<PB N="11" REF="023177_0011_0FBDDC2DEADCA030">the be&s;t. Abilities may, like a &s;oil, be rich, and yet without u&s;e. It is educa|tion cultivates them. It is upon this cul|tivation we depend for &s;ecular intere&s;t; and tho all forms of education may not be nece&s;&s;ary, yet &s;ome exi&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity. The difference of abilities, their capacity for various improvement and various &s;uc|ce&s;s, cannot be di&s;puted. We may grant all we plea&s;e to education in employing the materials, and yet con&s;ent that the mate|rials are of different value. We may di|ver&s;ify &s;ucce&s;s, and yet own but one way to it. And tho we &s;ee it attend &s;ome who are de&s;titute of the higher means of edu|cation, yet we may pronounce it educa|tion &s;till. To be capable of acquiring may be a gift of nature; the means may be taught; and he may be mo&s;t wi&s;e and happy, in whom the&s;e qualifications unite; tho a greater &s;hare of either may in &s;ome mea&s;ure compen&s;ate for a rela|tive deficiency.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="023177_0012_0FBDDC2F6CC1E6A8">
LET us now inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es of ill &s;ucce&s;s. And they may be reduced to two&mdash;nature, and &s;ociety; but more fa|miliarly divide them&s;elves into three&mdash; from nature, &s;ociety in it&s;elf; and the vices from per&s;onal character. Nature includes all ob&s;tructions from the forma|tion of our bodies, or unfore&s;een contin|gencies; &s;ociety, all the evils ari&s;ing from the nature of the &s;ociety in which we live; and the vices, all the mi&s;ery ari&s;ing from the neglect to cultivate our natural abilities, or abu&s;e of them when exer|ci&s;ed.</P>
<P>SOME are &s;o formed, that the animal functions cannot be di&s;charged. They have not the u&s;ual &s;trength of body, or energy of mind. They have not all the &s;en&s;es perfect, or all the faculties of the &s;oul. Others have ability and di&s;po&s;ition for active life, but by &s;ome animal injury are prevented in the moment of pur&s;uit, or by the de&s;tructive elements lo&s;e all
<PB N="13" REF="023177_0013_0FBDDC30ED65F2C0">the means of enjoying the fruits of their labors. The&s;e evils, however, vary greatly in their con&s;equences. In the fir&s;t and rude &s;ocieties, the enjoyment upon com|pari&s;on is ea&s;ily recovered; and in &s;ome refined &s;ocieties, reputation will &s;urvive lo&s;&s;es, and urge the mo&s;t generous pro|tection. In regard to the&s;e events, we &s;ee the &s;overeignty of God; and however we may &s;urmount the evils they bring upon us, we experience our dependence, in the be&s;t projected plan of our &s;ucce&s;s. We cannot bring the will which appoints them, to our immediate ideas of right, or to our wi&s;hes and hopes. Con&s;idered then only as the &s;ubjects of Heaven, re|&s;ignation is our happine&s;s; which implies a full di&s;po&s;ition for the action required, in the natural circum&s;tances of life, through all their changes.</P>
<P>BUT as in all animal wants man re|quires a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he finds his refuge in
<PB N="14" REF="023177_0014_0FBDDC326AB43488">&s;ociety; which he enlarges at his di&s;|cretion and forms by habit into a mo&s;t u&s;eful rule of his life. In &s;ociety, he can obtain relief under all the evils he &s;uf|fers, which admit of his exi&s;tence; and to furni&s;h this relief, and to increa&s;e his &s;ecurity, he enters into it. In whatever form the contract, or the &s;tate, fir&s;t ex|i&s;ts, his expectation is nearly the &s;ame, tho various in degree. But &s;ociety does not always remedy the evils, again&s;t which it is provided; and this &s;tate forms an|other cla&s;s of ob&s;tructions to the &s;ucce&s;s of life in individuals. All &s;ocieties do not regard, as the object of their laws, the general welfare: hence, the many are &s;acrificed to the few. In all &s;ocieties, the pa&s;&s;ions of men di&s;play them&s;elves, and oppo&s;ed intere&s;ts create endle&s;s &s;ufferings to the weaker. The employments, al&s;o, being a&s;&s;igned to different cla&s;&s;es, and de|pending on the progre&s;s of commerce, and population, have their ob&s;tructions.
<PB N="15" REF="023177_0015_0FBDDC33ECA5C770">The revolutions in political bodies, which are perpetual, expo&s;e the members of &s;ociety to involuntary &s;ufferings; and in the&s;e the ambition of rulers has a great influence. The vices, too, are more &s;ure evils. By indolence they prevent all our ju&s;t exertions, and we become le&s;s in&s;tructed and qualified to enjoy &s;ocial life: or they ari&s;e from a too pa&s;&s;ionate pur&s;uit of the good to be obtained in &s;o|ciety &mdash;&s;uch as an inordinate pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure&mdash;an eager de&s;ire of gain, at the expence of equity and truth&mdash;and a fond|ne&s;s for di&s;tinctions, which involve us in de&s;tructive mea&s;ures.&mdash;Under this fate of humanity, our only relief is &s;till in &s;ociety: our virtues mu&s;t entitle our claims, and the &s;ocial affections be pre|pared to pronounce them ju&s;t.</P>
<P>WE pa&s;s now to con&s;ider the di&s;po&s;ition to relieve, upon which Job pronounces his claim.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="023177_0016_0FBDDC356D3BC5E0">
SO FAR as the evils of life are within human power, we can re&s;train the cau&s;es from their mo&s;t painful operation. We can &s;uccor the infirm, relieve the unfor|tunate: we can a&s;&s;i&s;t the indu&s;trious, and correct the vicious. But this a&s;&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t have its e&s;tabli&s;hed rules, and not depend upon the re&s;olution of the hour. It is an evil in&s;eparable from &s;ociety, which it is to le&s;&s;en, and therefore &s;hould have its in&s;titutions as permanent as &s;o|ciety it&s;elf. And while experience de|cides, that the laws and government of a people have a more determined influence upon them, than either climate or &s;oil&mdash; while, in oppo&s;ite governments, we &s;ee the &s;ame race zealous for freedom, or abject in &s;lavery&mdash;we cannot he&s;itate in ju&s;tifying all the mea&s;ures which give &s;trength to the &s;ocial principle in man. All expedients, then, which give men a particular intere&s;t in one another, are entitled to the encouragement of every
<PB N="17" REF="023177_0017_0FBDDC36ED9B6270">friend of mankind. The hand of charity may be extended to the &s;ufferer, in the hour of his di&s;tre&s;s: but this is not &s;ub|&s;tantial relief. The good &s;hould be permanent; and as the object is great, the hands &s;hould be united. The helple&s;s children are not relieved, merely by the bread they eat; or fit to live, by being pre&s;erved in exi&s;tence till they can labor with their own hands for a mercenary employer. A generous relief is &s;uch as a father would be&s;tow&mdash;the familiar means of education, for the valuable ends of the &s;ociety in which they live&mdash;a fair inquiry into their abilities, and u&s;eful &s;uccor in their fir&s;t attempts. And this a&s;&s;i&s;tance can be had only from happy combinations in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BUT all men are not di&s;po&s;ed to this generous &s;ervice. The excu&s;es are many, from their own wants, or their immediate
<PB N="18" REF="023177_0018_0FBDDC386BF39E10">dependents. It is the benevolent exer|tions of more &s;ocial tempers, which mu&s;t force into action &s;uch in&s;en&s;ible minds, and involve every man's happine&s;s in the &s;ucce&s;s of his neighbor. The &s;ocial in&s;ti|tutions mu&s;t exi&s;t, to obtain this a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. When they exi&s;t, they have the following &s;alutary con&s;equences. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ome men to fore&s;ee the evils of life, and provide remedies. The evils fore&s;een provide caution, and the remedies render relief &s;ea&s;onable. There are many added to &s;ociety, who might have been lo&s;t forever. Families, al&s;o, are not abandoned to de&s;pair. Being un|der the kind in&s;pection of benefactors, they are encouraged to maintain their rank, educate their children, and conti|nue their exertions. In &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, it becomes honorable, as well as u&s;eful, to relieve di&s;tre&s;s. It is impo&s;&s;ible by argu|ment to influence &s;ome men to make the
<PB N="19" REF="023177_0019_0FBDDC39ECDE86C8">lea&s;t voluntary &s;acrifice of their intere&s;t. The work mu&s;t be begun by &s;entiment; and, upon the lea&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, it will be a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by pride; and this will become hon|or, and of &s;teady influence.</P>
<P>WHEN examples are before our eyes, of families redeemed from de&s;truction, every man's danger will urge his care.&mdash; If he be not in danger, his children may need a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and if they e&s;cape, it is &s;urely for his own &s;ecurity that no per|&s;ons be for&s;aken, and, under the depre&s;|&s;ion of adver&s;ity, plunge into the low vi|ces. Indeed, wealth, in large &s;ocieties, will have few po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, who will not find it for their ea&s;e and intere&s;t to move in this &s;ocial vortex. In con&s;equence, &s;en|timent will prevail over a mercenary in|tere&s;t. Men, being accu&s;tomed to act, not as will merely promote their &s;ecular intere&s;t, but the good of &s;ociety upon the
<PB N="20" REF="023177_0020_0FBDDC3B6B9E13A0">whole, will in&s;en&s;ibly, tho &s;urely, gain &s;ocial habits. To act from &s;entiment, is to act from a tender con&s;cience; and &s;en|timent is the be&s;t &s;ecurity both of virtue and religion. A man, who accu&s;toms him&s;elf to act in this manner, will ac|quire a mind &s;uperior to all di&s;honorable gains, to the rigor of ju&s;tice, or a con|tempt of other men; and then &s;ociety will have a friend and benefactor in him.</P>
<P>THE &s;ocial relations will al&s;o be objects of more &s;ober de&s;ire, and more &s;ure pro|tection. Men will not fear to engage in relations, which appear to be the honor|able charge of all good men; and they will be a&s;hamed to neglect that attention, which &s;trangers would be bound to be|&s;tow in their ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>A FREQUENT intercour&s;e with the mi|&s;erable would have an happy influence upon &s;ociety. Men would bear upon
<PB N="21" REF="023177_0021_0FBDDC3CEAA816F8">their minds, not only the gains they pro|cure, but the mi&s;ery they occa&s;ion. And their apprehen&s;ions of the la&s;t, would check their inordinate pur&s;uit of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>SUCH knowledge of human life would facilitate the progre&s;s of &s;ociety. They, who from their wealth have the greate&s;t influence on human affairs, would have the mo&s;t exten&s;ive knowledge of the wants of men, and be di&s;po&s;ed to relieve them. This happy communication improves the confidence of &s;ociety, and brings every expedient for the public good into fami|liar view. Such &s;ocial in&s;titutions would remove numerous prejudices which em|bitter life. Travelling into foreign coun|tries has been often recommended, to wear off tho&s;e partialities, which action in confined life, and very narrow circles, occa&s;ions: and the re&s;ult commonly is, with di&s;creet minds, a di&s;covery of the
<PB N="22" REF="023177_0022_0FBDDC3E6D5295B8">deep impre&s;&s;ions made by early a&s;&s;ocia|tions, prevalent cu&s;toms and opinions, and from the nature of the employment, and of the government. All men have not opportunities for ob&s;ervation, who go abroad; but as we &s;ee men abating their prejudices again&s;t men of any reli|gion, by an acquaintance with them, &s;o, by a careful in&s;pection of our own neigh|borhood, we di&s;cover all the &s;ufficient cau|&s;es for the variety of opinion which ex|i&s;ts. The aver&s;ion decrea&s;es, as men are more known; and the happine&s;s of life improves, in ju&s;t proportion.</P>
<P>ANOTHER effect is upon religion. Su|per&s;tition has its cau&s;e from an ignorance of natural law; bigotry from an igno|rance of mankind. The power of reli|gion is confe&s;&s;ed, upon the &s;ame princi|ples as the &s;ocial character&mdash;upon &s;enti|ment. When they blend them&s;elves to|gether,
<PB N="23" REF="023177_0023_0FBDDC3FED33EE10">religion is the &s;tronge&s;t obligation to the duties of &s;ociety. Its rites have the&s;e duties as their object, and their re|ward; and its in&s;tructions are formed to make life happy. A conviction of the&s;e con&s;equences has made &s;uper&s;titious bigots &s;o timorous of &s;ocial in&s;titutions, &s;o fond of retirement, and &s;o ready to exclude any thing as their object but de|votion. It is hence they have an aver|&s;ion to moral di&s;cour&s;es, as lifele&s;s; and a fondne&s;s for terror, as in&s;truction.</P>
<P>WE are now prepared for the la&s;t part of our di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;to con&s;ider how the &s;en&s;e of our common mortality may be improved to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;ocial principle.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee, that generous ambition finds its object in &s;ociety&mdash;that wealth derives its value from the &s;ame &s;ource&mdash;and that vice, in all its plea&s;ures, is but an abu&s;e
<PB N="24" REF="023177_0024_0FBDDC416E297D58">of this favorite enjoyment. Religion brightens, only as it adds its motives to our happine&s;s, and promotes happy &s;o|ciety, by forming from it all its emblems of heaven. Let us now &s;earch out ano|ther object for wealth. It is beyond our own nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e&mdash;at lea&s;t we have not appropriated it for our&s;elves&mdash;Where &s;hall we find its objects? We think not of friends, or neighbors&mdash;of &s;ocial in&s;ti|tutions, or public benefit. Are we to live here forever, to contemplate it, to make favorite compari&s;ons, and to &s;ee the world below us? In a few days, we mu&s;t go hence, and return no more. We have not the hope left, of ca&s;ting an eye again upon the tran&s;ient &s;cene; and our prop|erty is alienated forever. No ble&s;&s;ed friend announces our bounty; no heart is warm with gratitude; and death di&s;|charges us of the load, without our con|&s;ent, Not a particle of earth lays lighter
<PB N="25" REF="023177_0025_0FBDDC42EC2A3A88">upon us. Not a &s;ingle hair of our heads e&s;capes di&s;&s;olution&mdash;and we are gone for|ever. Our pains in di&s;&s;olution are not le&s;s &s;evere. The &s;overeign hand of Heaven trembles not at our wealth, or our power. Our activity and di&s;cern|ment defend us not from the &s;troke&mdash; Death demands us; and we &s;ee our own fate in the meane&s;t of mankind. It is death, tho under a canopy of &s;tate; and the &s;ame death that overtakes the bewil|dered and unburied traveller in the de|&s;ert. In all political concerns, wealth is a dangerous po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to a man, who&s;e heart dwells upon it; for every revolu|tion has it as its object. Commerce &s;hares its bounty with the rich and poor; excepting that the la&s;t are nearer to the nece&s;&s;ary wants of life, and not liable to the &s;ame changes. But for all its toils there is no compen&s;ation. There is no true happine&s;s in dying rich, unle&s;s u&s;e|ful to our&s;elves and other men.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="023177_0026_0FBDDC446D1411D0">
AND do we not &s;ee the be&s;t turned out every day? Is it not an admonition, that we mu&s;t &s;oon remove? Shall not our wealth &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ing of po&s;terity up|on our own de&s;cendants; and, as we have a&s;&s;i&s;ted others, urge men to a&s;&s;i&s;t our own in turn?</P>
<P>AND can a better example be pre&s;ent|ed, than in our decea&s;ed friend, who was the head of a charitable &s;ociety?&mdash;His virtues were not o&s;tentatious. He pro|voked no man's envy, but &s;ought every man's happine&s;s. He pur&s;ued no man's prai&s;e, but en&s;ured every man's affection. The confidence of mankind he valued, &s;o as to endeavor to de&s;erve it; and he has now left the world&mdash;and memory, and the virtues, are his mourners.</P>
<P>HE has left the mo&s;t u&s;eful in&s;titution, of which he was MASTER, in a very un|happy
<PB N="27" REF="023177_0027_0FBDDC45EEE0DAC0">&s;ituation. And as it is a lauda|ble object, e&s;pecially to the principal gentlemen of this a&s;&s;embly, it may not be improper to comply with a de&s;ire to have it con&s;idered.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t charitable in&s;titutions, in common with every other good thing, are liable to abu&s;e; and it has been a que&s;tion, whether &s;ome foundations have not increa&s;ed the evils they were intended to remedy. But as this in&s;titution com|prehends only friends in the &s;ame pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and its dangers are &s;o well de|fined, it e&s;capes all the principal objections which have been advanced, and has the mo&s;t full claim to the regard of all men employed in commerce.</P>
<P>THE favorable influence of &s;ocial in|&s;titutions has been already di&s;played. The MARINE SOCIETY has its full &s;hare of
<PB N="28" REF="023177_0028_0FBDDC476F1F6E48">this influence. It is confe&s;&s;ed, that to commerce we owe our enlightened age: by it, the genius of modern nations is formed, and their laws and religion. The political virtue of our mariners is more &s;ecure, as they are maintained in the &s;ocial virtues, and love of their coun|try; and their &s;ecurity adds to their po|litical u&s;efulne&s;s. We are all &s;en&s;ible that they are particularly expo&s;ed to danger, e&s;pecially on our coa&s;t, in this &s;ea&s;on of the year. A &s;hipwreck, a nece&s;&s;ity of returning after an arrival on the coa&s;t, and the frequent de&s;truction on the ocean, not only involve property, but lives; and the be&s;t pro&s;pects are lo&s;t in a &s;ingle voyage. Into what &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s are their families plunged! And is there no relief? What is the la&s;t wi&s;h of the dying mariner, when he quits the &s;hat|tered plank? What angui&s;h for his fa|mily at home! What are the emotions of his companion, who receives the tid|ings!
<PB N="29" REF="023177_0029_0FBDDC48F2355908">Is there a heart on earth &s;o truly &s;ocial as the mariner's? Is there a life more formed for &s;ociety?&mdash;Let us do &s;omething for his family. Yes, &s;ays ev|ery generous friend. Do &s;omething&mdash;is not &s;omething done already? Can it be po&s;&s;ible that our friend &s;hould peri&s;h in the common danger, with a &s;ocial heart, and an hatred of every unmanly vice, and no way be devi&s;ed to &s;ecure on remain|ing comfort to his wretched family?&mdash; And &s;hould he e&s;cape the &s;torm, and leave all his property to the ocean, are there no united friends to &s;uccor &s;o worthy a companion, and feed his hopes? Is he to wander in the &s;treets, and tell his tale to the thoughtle&s;s pa&s;&s;enger? Is he to renounce his rank, and, forgetful of what he once was, de&s;cend to the meane&s;t &s;er|vices, when he lo&s;t his intere&s;t without guilt? Is his amiable wife and lovely children to have no claims; or has the unhappy man, in his gains, never depo|&s;ited
<PB N="30" REF="023177_0030_0FBDDC4A6E54F640">for others, what he may claim for his own nece&s;&s;ities? Is thus the gener|ous mariner to abandon him&s;elf to the winds and the waves? Forbid it, Hea|ven, that the men, be&s;t fitted to live in &s;ociety, &s;hould prepare the lea&s;t! That they &s;hould have no band of union&mdash;no protection for &s;uffering merit&mdash;no honor in the welfare of each other, who live and die for &s;ociety! That they &s;hould be ex|po&s;ed to oppre&s;&s;ion, without u&s;eful com|binations, who de&s;pi&s;e inju&s;tice mo&s;t!&mdash; Or, that they, who purcha&s;e wealth with their lives, &s;hould renounce their politi|cal importance! Will not the in&s;urance of their property, and the communication of u&s;eful ob&s;ervations, be more &s;ure, if they are repre&s;ented by their friends, and forget not that it is their honor, their &s;e|curity, and their character, to be bre|thren?</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="023177_0031_0FBDDC4BF16B9C80">
AND yet with how much &s;upinene&s;s has this &s;ubject been con&s;idered! An in|&s;titution, begun twenty-five years ago, with an hundred members, now reduced to a few, who have been obliged, by humble expedients, to pre&s;erve the form of their in&s;titution&mdash;printing and re|printing their articles, without effect.&mdash; And now their mo&s;t active friend is gone forever! How can I give thee up!&mdash; Strengthen the things which remain, and are ready to die. See the generous exer|tions of a town in this county, to facili|tate its navigation by the &s;ame in&s;titution, and with a &s;mall portion of our wealth. See the many humane &s;ocieties of our ca|pital; and let it be &s;aid, while it is acknowledged the town of SALEM has the be&s;t mariners, mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing, and at home mo&s;t reputable in &s;ociety, that they have vigor to keep an in&s;titution to re|lieve the di&s;tre&s;s of a &s;hipwrecked mari|ner, and give con&s;olation to his amiable
