<P>IT is obvious to me, when Men propo&s;e a Scheme to effect any Matter of Moment, they &s;hould not only con&s;ider that Thing in its fir&s;t Appearance, but ought judiciou&s;ly to con&s;ider what may be the Con&s;equence thereof, and That not only in &s;ome Particulars, but in the large&s;t Extention the Ca&s;e will admit of; and if, after &s;ufficient In&s;pection, they have Rea&s;on to believe the pre&s;ent Pur|&s;uit may be attended with a Load of In|conveniences to either private or publick Affairs, and tho&s;e Inconveniences to over-ballance the Ju&s;tne&s;s that in Spe|culation might be annexed to the pre&s;ent Pur&s;uit; that then it &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, and not carried into Execution.</P>

<P>Render unto Cae&s;ar the Things that are Cae&s;ar's, and unto God the Things that are God's.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN order to fix the Reader's Mind the more intent upon the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> con&s;ider who de&s;erves that Appella|tion <HI>(Cae&s;ar.)</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> What are the Things that belong to <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> And</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Shall make it appear an Act of in|di&s;putable Ju&s;tice, to render tho&s;e Things un|to <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Men have found it nece&s;&s;ary, in mo&s;t Ages of the World, to appoint one Head or Ruler over them, according to the &s;ettled Bounds of Nations; this being done by the Con&s;ent of the Whole, it lays them under an actual Acknowledgment to his Sovereignty, under which, Methods have been formed, not only to e&s;tabli&s;h him in that Dignity, but to protect his &s;acred Per&s;on to all Intents and Pur|po&s;es. Under which Sanction, the Superior and Inferior are in&s;eparably bound to each other, the one to command, the other to obey, except in religious Matters, we are to <HI>render unto God the Things that are God's.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007635_0004_102D96F7C6A5E780">Men of that Cla&s;s have been e&s;tabli&s;hed un|der divers Appellations, according to the Cir|cum&s;tance of Affairs, or the Judgments of People, in their different Nations.</P>
<P><HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was a <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor, unto whom <HI>I&s;rael</HI> at that Time was tributary. The Word <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> ju&s;tly applied at that Time, &s;ignified Chief Ruler, or King, and hath a ju&s;t Repre|&s;entation to our pre&s;ent Sovereign GEORGE, King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall con&s;ider what are the Things that belong to <HI>Cae&s;ar:</HI> In the fir&s;t Place I &s;hall &s;hew, that when a King a&s;cends the Throne, he, by Con&s;ent, is bound in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner, by Oath, to defend the Rights and Pri|vileges belonging to the Crown, both civil and religious; and not only at Home, but it ex|tends unto the furthermo&s;t Parts of his Terri|tories. And the whole lieth under an equal Claim to his Protection.</P>
<P>The Parliament, who act in Conjunction with the King, repre&s;ent the Nation, and are cho&s;e by tho&s;e that have a Right to chu&s;e them; they are cho&s;e by the Majority, which may, in that Ca&s;e, be deemed the Whole.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o bound, by &s;olemn Oath, to be faithful Subjects, to di&s;charge their Tru&s;t as by Law appointed, or as Nece&s;&s;ity may require; therefore what they do, his Maje&s;ty agreeing therewith, may ju&s;tly be termed an Act of the whole Nation, and layeth an ab&s;olute Con|&s;traint on every Subject to act con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, agreeable to the mo&s;t &s;olemn Ties he is under; this formeth a good Government;
<PB N="7" REF="007635_0005_102D96FA9BABA228">
and it is impo&s;&s;ible for any Government, either civil or religious, to be &s;upported without a ge|neral Contribution of Money to defray the Ex|pence that will nece&s;&s;arily accrue in the Admi|ni&s;tration thereof.</P>
<P>Under which Con&s;ideration, the King and Parliament have made Laws, which are bind|ing to the whole Realm; Laws that are not grievous, but ea&s;y to be borne; Laws that lay an equitable Taxation on the Whole, and o|bligeth every One to bear his proportionable Share.</P>
<P>It is an actual Agreement between a King and his Subjects; they are bound in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner that Mankind are capable of, to <HI>render unto Cae&s;ar the Things that are Cae&s;ar's,</HI> whenever they are lawfully called thereunto.</P>
<P>It is an undeniable Debt, contracted at our Birth, and but ju&s;t and hone&s;t in us to hold our&s;elves in Readine&s;s to di&s;charge it as the Payments become due, which will be to <HI>render Cu&s;tom to whom Cu&s;tom is due, Tribute to whom Tribute is due.</HI> I &s;hall conclude the &s;econd Part with &s;aying, that he who is thus found in the Di&s;charge of his real Duty, not only <HI>ren|ders unto Cae&s;ar the Things that are Cae&s;ar's,</HI> but <HI>unto God the Things that are God's, viz.</HI> a good Con&s;cience.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I conclude by this time we &s;hall agree, that our pre&s;ent Sovereign is the Per&s;on to whom Tribute is due, and that we his pre|&s;ent Subjects are the Per&s;ons, under the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn Ties, obliged to pay it, and can by no Means (under a Cloak of Ju&s;tice) &s;kreen our|&s;elves
<PB N="8" REF="007635_0006_102D96FF352BD4E8">
from <HI>rendering unto Cae&s;ar the Things that are Cae&s;ar's.</HI></P>
<P>However, in order to put the Thing in an obvious Light, I &s;hall begin, as I think, at the Foundation, and con&s;ider the pre&s;ent Situation of Affairs in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> re&s;pecting his pre|&s;ent Maje&s;ty King GEORGE, who rules the&s;e Nations, under the indi&s;putable Title of Heir to the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> and who, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner, by Oath, hath bound him&s;elf, both to God and Man, to protect the Prote&s;tant Religion, and to defend the King|dom from the Encroachments of perfidious Enemies.</P>
<P>This being the real Situation of our pre&s;ent King, I am nece&s;&s;arily led to enquire, how or in what Manner he may be rendered capable of di&s;charging that &s;o weighty an Affair, with|out the hearty A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Subjects; and at this critical Juncture, when a potent Enemy threatens an Inva&s;ion, and gladly would de|throne the be&s;t of Kings, and involve the Na|tion in a general Ma&s;&s;acre. But to return, As the King is bound by Oath, he con&s;cientiou&s;ly believes, with Thou&s;ands more, that it is his ab&s;olute Duty (both in the Sight of God and Man) to defend him&s;elf by Force of Arms; and as the Situation of Things appear at this Time, it &s;eems as tho' it were morally impo&s;|&s;ible to &s;ucceed in other Terms, for by Ac|counts from Home it appeareth, that our Su|periors in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> have (&s;ince they di&s;|covered the ill Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>French,</HI> their re&s;tle&s;s Enemies) rai&s;ed large Sums of Money
<PB N="9" REF="007635_0007_102D970151B829D0">
for the King's U&s;e, which Monies being ap|propriated to Military Purpo&s;es, the &s;everal Sums being rai&s;ed by Tax, Men of every Cla&s;s pay it with Chearfulne&s;s; they <HI>render unto Cae&s;ar the Things that are Cae&s;ar's,</HI> well knowing it to be their Duty to obey God, and honour their King; this very Money, which is rai&s;ed by Tax, is now, and hath been for twelve Months pa&s;t, applied in building Ships of War, in rai&s;ing Forces both for Sea and Land, in purcha&s;ing Artillery, Ammunition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> on purpo&s;e for Defence, the Con&s;equence of which will be &s;hedding of Blood, unle&s;s the Enemy keep their Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>And altho' this be the very Ca&s;e, I find not one Scrutineer among them; the King com|mands, the Subjects obey; under which Oe|conomy there is a plea&s;ant Harmony. In which Situation I &s;hall leave them unto the Protection of Him who never fails to reward tho&s;e who con&s;cientiou&s;ly obey his Commands, which are, <HI>Render unto Cae&s;ar the Things that are Cae&s;ar's, and unto God the Things that are God's.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now take a View of my native Land, where I expect to find Things of a dif|ferent Character, that may occa&s;ion me to make particular Remarks thereon, which, if accord|ing to the Nature of the Ca&s;e, I hope to be excu&s;ed; my De&s;ign is genuine; it is with a View to prevail upon all Men to <HI>pay Cu&s;tom to whom Cu&s;tom is due, Tribute to whom Tri|bute is due.</HI> In the fir&s;t Place, I &s;hall undeniably make it appear, that our Governor and A&s;|&s;embly
<PB N="10" REF="007635_0008_102D9703D3809D60">
in this Province, repre&s;ent the King and Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> becau&s;e they are fixed Mini&s;ters here, with the &s;ame Powers of Legi&s;lature to manage the King's Affairs in this di&s;tant Colony; their Authority is firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by Act of Parliament; and if what they do appears to be &s;ubordinate to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> it is as firm and binding to us, and ought with as equal Ju&s;tice to be obeyed, as though the King him&s;elf commanded.</P>
<P>And altho' the Laws here are not verbatim with the Laws of <HI>England</HI> in every Ca&s;e, yet that re&s;pecting the Legi&s;lative Power, is con|firmed by Act of Parliament; under which Act, there is a Method pre&s;cribed for us to chu&s;e a lawful Number of Men, which repre|&s;ent the Whole; and they being of our own chu&s;ing, what they do re&s;pecting the Legi&s;la|tion, is our own Act; for, in the fir&s;t Step, we come under the Sanction of Law, becau&s;e all are prohibited, and have no Vote, who are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an E&s;tate to the Value of <HI>Fifty Pounds,</HI> this being a particular Paragraph of Law which every Voter appealeth to for Safe|ty, under which he acknowledgeth that he par|ticularly and directly engageth him&s;elf, under Sanction of Oath, to be a faithful Subject to his King, becau&s;e we are a Body Corporate, and every Per&s;on, thus &s;ituated, a real Member of that Body, and will inevitably remain as &s;uch, unle&s;s he refu&s;e to pay Tribute unto <HI>Cae|&s;ar.</HI> I al&s;o con&s;ider, that our Governor and A&s;&s;embly are bound, by &s;olemn Oath or Af|firmation, to be faithful Subjects to their King
<PB N="11" REF="007635_0009_102D970702600458">
and are placed as Guardians to the Province; for which Rea&s;on, I hope we may allow that it is their particular Bu&s;ine&s;s to make all nece&s;|&s;ary In&s;pection into the State of the Province, by which Means they may probably be capable of guarding again&s;t impending Danger.</P>
<P>I query, Whether this be not their real Du|ty? And if &s;o, I query, How they may be able to effect it, without our A&s;&s;i&s;tance? And in what Manner do we a&s;&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s it be in paying Tax? And how incon&s;i&s;tent do tho&s;e appear with them&s;elves, in refu&s;ing to pay Tax; do they con&s;ider what a Train of Contradictions they are heaping on their own Heads? In the fir&s;t Place, they have entered into a Contract with their King, and in that have laid an Obli|gation upon them&s;elves to be faithful Subjects, and at the &s;ame time refu&s;e to pay him his ju&s;t Dues; this is no other (in the Body Corporate) but that they are doing a Thing, and at the &s;ame time are not doing that Thing.&mdash;They are willing to pay the King his Dues, but at the &s;ame time are not willing to pay the King his Dues. The&s;e are plain Contradictions, and as plain Truths.</P>
<P>Are any &s;o weak as to imagine this Province can remain under a good Con&s;titution, and no Taxes levied? I think not, by Men of com|mon Sen&s;e: Well, if that be the Ca&s;e, I &s;hall a&s;k one Que&s;tion, which is, Under what Ap|pellation could the pre&s;ent Act have been &s;et forth in, more agreeable to the &s;everal Deno|minations of People in this Province, under which Appellation divers Taxes have been le|vied,
<PB N="12" REF="007635_0010_102D97091DE726C0">
and the Money paid (I believe) without one Prick of Con&s;cience, until this critical Juncture; in which (perhaps) there never was more Need of Money to be rai&s;ed, nor was there ever more Need of &s;hewing Loyalty to a King, or of maintaining Amity among our|&s;elves; when we are threatened by a potent Enemy Abroad; while we have &s;uffered &s;o many irreparable Damages from a barbarous and &s;avage Enemy at Home?</P>
<P>I &s;hall now recite an infallible Text of Scrip|ture, in order to encourage the well-di&s;po&s;ed Part, the Sub&s;tance of which, I think, may well &s;erve for a Touch&s;tone, by Virtue of which every Scrutineer may try his uncommon Con&s;cience; <HI>Matt.</HI> xvii. 24. <HI>And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received Tri|bute Money, came to Peter and &s;aid, Doth your Ma&s;ter pay Tribute? He &s;aith, Yes. And when he was come into the Hou&s;e, Je&s;us prevented him, &s;aying, What thinke&s;t thou, Simon? Of whom do the Kings of the Earth take Cu&s;tom or Tri|bute? of their own Children, or of Strangers? Peter &s;aith unto him, of Strangers. Je&s;us &s;aith unto him, then are the Children free. Notwith|&s;tanding, le&s;t we &s;hould offend them, go thou to the Sea, and ca&s;t an Hook, and take up the Fi&s;h that fir&s;t cometh up; and when thou ha&s;t opened his Mouth, thou &s;halt find a Piece of Money&punc; that take, and give unto them for me and thee.</HI></P>
<P>I look upon this as an infallible Precedent to every true Believer in CHRIST&punc; it is not only his a&s;&s;enting to a Thing, but it is doing that
<PB N="13" REF="007635_0011_102D970AC09B0B68">
Thing; it is not only his Advice to <HI>Peter</HI> to give, but &s;aith, <HI>Go, give this for me and thee.</HI></P>
<P>This Tribute or Tax, was paid under the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor, who was at that Time car|rying on a War, the Con&s;equence of which is always &s;hedding of Blood.</P>
<P>But might not JESUS have &s;hewed a &s;uffi|cient Rea&s;on wherein he was not taxable? Ob|&s;erve the Text, when he a&s;keth <HI>Simon, Of whom do the Kings of the Earth take Cu&s;tom or Tribute, of their own Children, or of Strangers? Peter &s;aith, of Strangers; Je&s;us &s;aith unto him, then are the Children free.</HI> This meaneth, that as he him&s;elf was the Son of God, who was and is the King and Ruler of the whole Uni|ver&s;e, and unto whom every Part belongs, was in Reality, and ab&s;olutely exempt from paying Tax; and altho' this was the very Ca&s;e, there was no He&s;itation on it; no, he &s;aith to <HI>Peter, Notwith&s;tanding, le&s;t we &s;hould offend them, go and give unto them for me and thee.</HI> Ob&s;erve, this was all acted under an Heathen Emperor, which is far from being the Ca&s;e with us; for we have not only a Chri&s;tian King, but perhaps the be&s;t of Kings that ever &s;way'd the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Scepter.&mdash;A King, who&s;e &s;uperior Virtues, and tender Indulgence towards his Subjects, is too little regarded by that Cla&s;s of Men.&mdash;But no Wonder, when Men refu&s;e to make CHRIST their Example, and will not do what he hath po&s;itively commanded them to do; I &s;ay I do not wonder that tho&s;e Men refu&s;e to obey a Chri&s;tian King. I &s;hall in&s;pect into the Nature of the Ca&s;e, by Query, and examine whether
<PB N="14" REF="007635_0012_102D9710283DAE78">
there be any real Cau&s;e, or good Foundation, for this unlook'd for Scruple of Con&s;cience.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether CHRIST, meaning the God|head, who is from all Eternity to all Eternity, did not know as well what would be Man's Duty to the End of the World, as at that Juncture?</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether he would in Reality do any Thing which might be made a Precedent, and whether Men receiving it as &s;uch, did not act the Chri&s;tian Part?</P>
<P N="3">3. Whether CHRIST rendering unto <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> the Things that were <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s, will not ju&s;tify us, if we do the like?</P>
<P N="4">4. Whether it hath not in it&s;elf the great|e&s;t Incon&s;i&s;tency, for CHRIST, when per&s;onal|ly on Earth, to do a Thing, and in the &s;ame Di&s;pen&s;ation (by his Spirit) forbid his Follow|ers to do that Thing?</P>
<P N="5">5. Whether Mens Con&s;ciences ought to be a Director to us, when it is evident that they are not dictated by the Spirit of CHRIST?</P>
<P N="6">6. And whether we ought to abandon hu|man Rea&s;on, and &s;acrifice our brighte&s;t Facul|ties, to confide in the particular Humour of two or three Self-conceited Men?</P>
<P>I &s;hall a&s;k this Que&s;tion, Did you ever read the Hi&s;tory of the Per&s;ecutions under the &s;eve|ral Emperors? If you have, I would have you to read them the &s;econd Time, where perhaps you may find a near Emblem; you may &s;ee the very Ri&s;e of Apo&s;tacy, and what was the fir&s;t Step to the &s;o much lamented De|clen&s;ion; you may &s;ee, that Men, in&s;tead of
<PB N="15" REF="007635_0013_102D9711C30909E0">
Religion, practi&s;ed Super&s;tition; you may &s;ee, that Men, who &s;hould have honoured God, rather honoured them&s;elves; you may &s;ee, that Men, who ought to have allowed the &s;ole In|fallibility to God, proclaimed them&s;elves infal|lible.</P>
<P>I &s;hall offer the Rea&s;ons for the la&s;t Para|graph, re&s;pecting the Declen&s;ion of the Church; the fir&s;t Motion was Super&s;tition; Men valuing them&s;elves upon their own Judgments, by which Means they under-valued their Neigh|bours, and &s;till believed that they them&s;elves grew better and wi&s;er.</P>
<P>Under which grand Opinion of Self, they were repeatedly laying Injunctions upon the Church (and that at fir&s;t) in trivial Matters chiefly; by which Means they lo&s;t the Power of true Religion, and &s;et up Forms in the Room thereof; and tho&s;e Forms &s;o prevail|ed, that, I am of Opinion, there is but lit|tle el&s;e; a Word to the Wi&s;e may be enough. Therefore, it is Wi&s;dom for all Cla&s;&s;es of Men to particularly guard again&s;t this impending Danger.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, I advi&s;e the Clergy to en|tertain a better Opinion of the Laity than of them&s;elves; and the Laity to think of the Clergy ju&s;t as they are.</P>
<P>Self-righteou&s;ne&s;s and Bigotry hath been the greate&s;t Enemies that ever a militant Church have had, and have ever been u&s;ele&s;s in Affairs of State.</P>
<P>But when they creep into the Church, they are much of the Nature of a Pe&s;tilence, they
<PB N="16" REF="007635_0014_102D9713FB413080">
infect almo&s;t the Whole, and the chief Rea|&s;on is, becau&s;e the Clergy pretend to more than other Men; more Knowledge and more Experience; and to confirm it, in &s;teps the Bigot, and &s;aith, Amen. And when thus met, there is a Conference, in which there may be a narrow In&s;pection, perhaps, not only in Church but State Affairs.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e Con&s;ultations (I think) it was, that the Bill, for granting Money for the King's U&s;e, was con&s;idered.</P>
<P>But ob&s;erve, the Council at that Time was but very &s;mall; however, after a Deliberation upon it, up &s;tands a Clergyman, and giveth his Opinion concerning the Bill then lying before them, which was to this Purport, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>I have con&s;idered the Tenor of this Bill, which is for granting <HI>Sixty Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> for the King's U&s;e, and do not find my|&s;elf free to pay the Tax, but &s;hall &s;uffer a Di|&s;traint on my Goods.</P>

<P>I'll tell thee; the Act &s;pecifies it in &s;uch a promi&s;cuous Manner, that I cannot be free to pay. I own, they have pointed out two particular Articles, unto which I can freely pay my Tax, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e that are for the Sup|port of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Inhabitants, and for con|tinuing our Alliance with the friendly <HI>Indians.</HI></P>

<P>I'll inform thee; it is that Part which is mentioned for the King's U&s;e; becau&s;e, thou knows, we are principled again&s;t War, both offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bigot.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, by no Means; I would not have any Hand in carrying on a War: But can we refu&s;e to pay Tax? It &s;eems to me as if the King's Dues were the mo&s;t rea&s;onable of all Taxes.</P>

<P>Alack-a-day! true enough; that ne|ver once entered my Mind; poor weak Crea|tures we are; was it not for your con&s;tant Care over us, I doubt we &s;hould not be able to with|&s;tand the many Temptations we are daily be|&s;et with; but I rejoice that there are a few faith|ful Ones that &s;tand for this &s;o ju&s;t a Cau&s;e. Pay it! no, I'll never pay it, without thee pays it fir&s;t.&mdash;Yet I find &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, which creates a Doubting, whether we may not af|front the A&s;&s;embly, in thus refu&s;ing to pay, when they have made a Law, and by that Law commanded us to pay; I want to be re&s;olved in this Ca&s;e.</P>

<P>I believe I can readily re&s;olve that Query: In the fir&s;t Place, as I ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, they are Men of our own chu&s;ing, and the Majority of the Hou&s;e of the &s;ame Religion that we are; and as they thought fit to lay this
<PB N="18" REF="007635_0016_102D971A77D810F8">
Burden upon us, I think we may with much more Freedom refu&s;e to comply.&mdash;Before we break up, I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that we who are pre&s;ent (tho' but few in Number) have heard, verbatim, the &s;tronge&s;t Objections we are able to make, with the Rea&s;ons why we make them; I &s;ay, I would be well plea&s;ed that we &s;hould u&s;e &s;ome Endeavours to in&s;inuate our Opinions into the Minds of others, for I am per&s;waded it would take with the Minds of many good hone&s;t People.</P>

<P>I &s;hall u&s;e my utmo&s;t Endeavour to per&s;wade all I can; there is &s;uch, and &s;uch, and many more, that I know would be of our Way of thinking, if they did but know your Minds.&mdash;And as to the Rea&s;ons that have been offered, I am fully per&s;waded they are &s;o &s;trong, and well-grounded, that we may always refu&s;e to pay Tax upon the like Footing.</P>
</SP>
<P>It was not long after the Adjournment of this Council, that their Minutes came under the Notice of a Freethinker, who, on a &s;erious Per|u&s;al, thought proper to make a Reply, which he hath done unto every Paragraph &s;eparately, and are as followeth:</P>
<P>Paragraph 1. <HI>I have con&s;idered the Tenor of this Bill, which is for granting</HI> Sixty Thou&s;and Pounds <HI>for the King's U&s;e; and do not find my|&s;elf free to pay the Tax; but &s;hall &s;uffer a Di|&s;traint on my Goods.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> For my Part, I am not able to fix a Meaning to that Paragraph; for if he had con|&s;idered it as the King's Dues, he mu&s;t al&s;o have con&s;idered, that it was his Duty to pay it;
<PB N="19" REF="007635_0017_102D971C712D0510">
and if he did not think it the King's Dues, he ought to have rendered his Rea&s;ons why.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that Taxes, Duties, and A&s;&s;izes&punc; are the &s;ole Revenues of the Kingdom, that I know of, and by which the whole Realm is &s;upported, re&s;pecting the Affairs of State; the&s;e are the King's Dues, fixed on him by Law; and every Voter hath a Hand in making the&s;e Laws, therefore, I &s;ay, it is as rea&s;onable to withhold the one, as the other, and the Whole, as any Part.</P>
<P>Yet, in my Opinion, there may be a more formidable Argument found (at times) again&s;t paying of Duty, than again&s;t paying Tax, for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e Goods on which the Du|ty is laid, by rea&s;on of dull Markets, are &s;old for little, if any, Advance more than the Du|ty, and we cannot be &s;upported in any Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, without a rea&s;onable Profit; this may af|ford &s;ome Colour of Rea&s;on; but in refu&s;ing to pay Tax, I find none.</P>
<P>Taxations are an unequal Injunction, I mean re&s;pecting Times; and when they are levied, as there is a fixed Law that Taxes may be levied, according to the pre&s;ent Emergency, which Power, in this Province, is &s;olely com|mitted unto the Governor and A&s;&s;embly, and if they command a Tax to be either for Sup|port or Defence of the Province, this Money, when rai&s;ed, is properly the King's Money; and as he hath appointed Mini&s;ters, under law|ful Qualifications, they are the Per&s;ons that mu&s;t appropriate this Money, in the be&s;t Man|ner they are able, to their Ma&s;ter's Service;
<PB N="20" REF="007635_0018_102D971F471971A0">
therefore I look upon the Tax to be the fun|damental Part of the King's Revenues; be|cau&s;e it may either be augmented or dimi|ni&s;hed, as the pre&s;ent State of Affairs requires.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now take &s;ome Notice of the la&s;t Sentence in that Paragraph; which is, <HI>But &s;hall &s;uffer a Di&s;traint on my Goods.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> No Wonder, if a Man do a Thing, at a Time when he hath no Power to refrain from doing that Thing. But what is the Con|&s;equence of refu&s;ing? Is it not an Attempt to defraud the King of his Dues? Becau&s;e, if a Man refu&s;e to pay, it is evident to me, that that Man is not willing to pay; and if that Unwillingne&s;s could find Protection, the King would never have his Dues. But if you are in Reality willing your Goods may be di&s;train|ed from you, you are certainly willing the King &s;hall have his Dues, becau&s;e that is the only Means by which he can obtain it. If you ingenuou&s;ly believe the above Tax to be the King's Dues, and refu&s;e to pay it, you not on|ly appear as di&s;loyal Subjects to your King, but entirely reject the po&s;itive Command of CHRIST, which is, <HI>Render unto Cae&s;ar the Things that are Cae&s;ar's, and unto God the Things that are God's.</HI></P>
<P>I would have you to con&s;ider it in this Light, whether you that refu&s;e to pay the Tax, do not the utmo&s;t in your Power to dethrone the be&s;t of Kings; who can be no more King, without his Subjects, than we can be Subjects, without a King. Although it is but little that
<PB N="21" REF="007635_0019_102D972315B66920">
one Man can do, yet that little is all he can do, and no Thanks to him for not doing more.</P>
<P><HI>Paragraph</HI> 2. I &s;hall now con&s;ider the Sub|&s;tance of the &s;econd Paragraph; where I find, he complains of the A&s;&s;embly's mixing or blending Things together, in &s;uch a Manner, that he cannot be free to pay the Tax; and in the &s;ame Paragraph &s;aith, that he is willing to pay the Tax in two Articles, which are, to &s;upport the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Inhabitants, and maintain our Alliance with the friendly <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, in my Opinion, this is a &s;trange Way of Rea&s;oning: What, mu&s;t the A&s;&s;embly make three &s;everal and di&s;tinct Acts, for rai&s;ing one and the &s;ame Sum of Money, and the Whole of that Money to be appropri|ated to the &s;ame Intents and Purpo&s;es?</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, I &s;ay, unle&s;s this Province is protected under the Title of King GEORGE, it may be morally impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall be able to help our&s;elves. Under this De|nomination the whole Money is di&s;tributed.&mdash; It is true, the Act &s;aith, to relieve the di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed Inhabitants; but that Money is con|verted to the King's U&s;e, as well as the re&s;t; unle&s;s they believe the Relieving the Back In|habitants is of no U&s;e to the King. If &s;o, by the &s;ame Parity of Rea&s;on, we may &s;uppo&s;e, the whole Province lieth under the &s;ame Cir|cum&s;tance.</P>
<P>And that Money which hath been given to the <HI>Indians,</HI> was with the &s;ame View (though to little Purpo&s;e) in order to &s;ecure their Friend|&s;hip, by which Means there might be Cor|re&s;pondence
<PB N="22" REF="007635_0020_102D9724C714AEE0">
held with them in Trade; which Trade mu&s;t certainly augment the Incomes of the Crown; and to prevent their killing the Inhabitants, and weaken the King, in his di|&s;tant Dominions.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, I &s;hall ob&s;erve the Clergyman's Wil|lingne&s;s to pay his Part of the pre&s;ent Tax: He &s;aith, he is willing to pay a Part, and at the &s;ame time he refu&s;es to pay the Whole; <HI>No, we will not pay one Penny.</HI> Here is &s;ome|thing new, as well as &s;trange; that he &s;hould be willing to comply with a Part of the Act, and at the &s;ame Moment cannot comply with any Part of that Act.</P>
<P><HI>Paragraph</HI> 3. In this Paragraph, he &s;hew|eth, that he is principled again&s;t Wars, both offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive; and for that Rea&s;on cannot pay the Tax.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> This being a Matter which toucheth Con&s;cience, I &s;hall not di&s;pute it with him, well remembering the Apo&s;tle's Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Let every Man be fully</HI> convinced <HI>in his own Mind.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Paragraph</HI> 4. I ob&s;erve, in this Paragraph, he hath produced a Suppo&s;ition, as the Funda|mental of his Argument, when he &s;aith, we &s;uppo&s;e there <HI>may be</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> War; and if &s;o, &s;ome of the Monies will doubtle&s;s be con|verted to that U&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> If this be a &s;ufficient Argument in this Province, to refu&s;e paying Tax, certain|ly in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> it is much more &s;o; where a War may be daily expected. But Suppo&s;ition can be no Argument to deter any Per&s;on in
<PB N="23" REF="007635_0021_102D9726FA933570">
paying his ju&s;t Debts. Neither doth it appear, with any Colour of Rea&s;on, that we &s;hould refu&s;e paying Tax, under a Suppo&s;ition that it will be appropriated to this, or the other U&s;e. It is certainly none of our Bu&s;ine&s;s which Way the King, or his Mini&s;ters, lay out his Money.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the Majority of the Hou&s;e, as he &s;aith, were of his Religion, he can, with more Confidence, refu&s;e to pay the Tax.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> This mu&s;t certainly be a wrong Re|pre&s;entation; for if they were of his Religion, they would act for his Safety, as much as the Nature of the Ca&s;e would admit of; becau&s;e they are &s;ubject to the &s;ame Act them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Our A&s;&s;embly is compo&s;ed of &s;uch Mem|bers, who were deemed the &s;uitable&s;t Men (in their &s;everal Counties, where they are be&s;t known) to repre&s;ent the People, doubtle&s;s for &s;ome apparent Virtues; and as this is the Ca&s;e, I look upon it as a Slight to their Cha|racters, to thus refu&s;e to comply with their con&s;ciencious Performances, and in this &s;o ju&s;t a Cau&s;e, where we are commanded by CHRIST, to obey, <HI>viz. Render unto Cae&s;ar the Things that are Cae&s;ar's.</HI></P>
<P>I am of Opinion, that a Sett of Men could hardly be found, who would have acted more judiciou&s;ly than they have done, in forming that Act, both for Ea&s;e of Church and State. For as they repre&s;ent the whole Province, they repre&s;ent the Members of every religious So|ciety in it; and as no one Denomination can be exempted from refunding this Tax, the
<PB N="24" REF="007635_0022_102D9729419F5C08">
Whole have an equal Right in the Appropri|ating of it.</P>
<P>And as a Part of the Hou&s;e was of Opinion, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to defend the Province again&s;t the Encroachments of a barbarous and &s;avage Heathen, who have committed Depre|dations and Murders in Time of Peace, I &s;ay, as a Part of the Hou&s;e thus thought it their Duty, would it not have appeared di&s;ingenuous in the re&s;t to have with&s;tood it, and under this Con&s;ideration, as a Part of the Money was their own? But, as the Clergyman owns them to be of his Religion, they mu&s;t certainly be acquainted with the Rules of that Religion as well as he; and if &s;o, he mu&s;t think they have fail'd a little, or we mu&s;t think he hath pick'd up &s;ome new Matter, that per|haps was never thought on before.</P>
<P>Towards the latter End of the Paragraph he &s;aith, "As they thought fit to lay this Burden upon us, I think we may with much more Freedom refu&s;e to pay it."</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it hath not appeared to me, by the Minutes of that Council, that there was any Burden at all; it is true, there is a Di&s;|cour&s;e, which, to me, appeareth only an A|mu&s;ement, and may po&s;&s;ibly lull &s;ome igno|rant People into a Kind of Lethargy. But, I think I may &s;afely conclude, that there is neither Divinity, Scripture, Law, nor Rea&s;on, to &s;up|port it.</P>
<P>But how could he with more Freedom re|fu&s;e to pay it, becau&s;e they were of his Reli|gion? For it plainly appeareth to me, that it
<PB N="25" REF="007635_0023_102D972BC929BFB8">
is an E&s;&s;ay towards a Divi&s;ion; for I pre&s;ume, we mu&s;t all allow the Legi&s;lators to be Head of the State; and it has been the Ca&s;e, for many Ages pa&s;t, that the Clergy have claimed the Title, of being Head of the Church; and whenever the&s;e two Powers cla&s;h, it has al|ways been attended with ill Con&s;equence to the Commonalty: But, in this pre&s;ent Affair, it may be in that Society of which he him&s;elf is a Member, and doubtle&s;s will occa&s;ion &s;ome Debate; notwith&s;tanding, I have Rea&s;on to believe the Majority will pay their Tax, well knowing, by this Time, they have for their Example the Saviour of the World.</P>
<P>But what Bu&s;ine&s;s have Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters with the Affairs of the King? Will they not take CHRIST for an Example in the one Thing nor the other? You may read, that when the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;ought to make CHRIST a King over them, he withdrew him&s;elf, and &s;aith, <HI>My Kingdom is not of this World; the Princes of the Earth u&s;urp Authority over one another, but it &s;hall not be &s;o with you.</HI> I think it is an indi&s;|putable Maxim, that every Mini&s;ter of CHRIST mu&s;t make CHRIST his Example; and if &s;o, I al&s;o believe they are quite exempt from State Affairs; their particular Bu&s;ine&s;s is, "to mind them&s;elves, and their Gifts; to exerci&s;e their pa&s;toral Function, according to their &s;everal Denominations of Religion;" and while thus &s;ituated, they may be of Service in the Church.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in&s;ert one more Text of Scripture, which hath a full Connection with the above, which was wrote by no le&s;s than the great A|po&s;tle
<PB N="26" REF="007635_0024_102D972F4F24D0D8">
to the <HI>Gentiles, Rom.</HI> xiii. 1. <HI>Let every Soul be &s;ubject unto the higher Powers. For there is no Power but of God; the Powers that be, are ordained of God. Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the Power, re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of God;</HI> and they that re&s;i&s;t, &s;hall receive to them&s;elves Dam|nation. Ver&s;e 5. <HI>Wherefore ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for Wrath, but al&s;o for Con|&s;cience Sake. For, for this Cau&s;e pay you Tribute al&s;o; for they are God's Mini&s;ters, attending con|tinually upon this very Thing. Render therefore to all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Cu&s;tom to whom Cu&s;tom, Fear to whom Fear, Ho|nour to whom Honour.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this &s;mall Tract, with mak|ing &s;ome Remarks on our pre&s;ent King's In|dulgence towards his Subjects, under their &s;e|veral Denominations of Religion: I believe, the good Qualities of a Monarch were never di&s;played under a more agreeable Appellation than that of <HI>Charity;</HI> I think the Apo&s;tle &s;heweth us, that it is the Height of Virtue, and that without it all our Performances are invalid. With this Virtue our King hath &s;hewed him&s;elf familiar in divers Re&s;pects; for he hath ever appeared an affectionate King to his Subjects, particularly in that of granting free Liberty to every religious Society to act in the Manner they think be&s;t; this is a Privi|lege that for many Ages of the World could never be enjoyed, neither can it be, at this Time, in &s;everal other Nations: Ought we not to look on this as the greate&s;t Favour that can be granted by any Monarch? I think it
<PB N="27" REF="007635_0025_102D973392E26190">
lays the greate&s;t Con&s;traint upon Mankind to u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours to &s;erve God, and honour the King.</P>
<P>I look upon it as our ab&s;olute Duty to join heartily together in every Affair, re&s;pecting the Pre&s;ervation of his &s;acred Per&s;on, or the Pro|tection of his Realm, in that great Duty of paying Tax; becau&s;e, by a diligent In&s;pection, I cannot find, that either the King or his Mi|ni&s;ters have laid any Injunction upon us, ei|ther directly or indirectly, that interferes with revealed Religion; and re&s;pecting tender Con|&s;ciences, I believe the King has been as care|ful in hurting of them, as we have been in maintaining of them as we ought to do. For In&s;tance, even at the Time when the Pretend|er landed his infernal Crew, and marched into <HI>England,</HI> with a View to &s;ubject the Inhabi|tants to the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Power, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate his Royal Per&s;on; yet at this critical Juncture I never under&s;tood that he &s;ummoned one Per|&s;on to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that made a Scruple of Con&s;cience in bearing Arms. Are not tho&s;e valuable Privileges too lightly look'd upon at this Time, by tho&s;e who refu&s;e to pay Tribute to whom Tribute is due? And at a Time when a War between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> is expect|ed; at a Time when our Fellow-Subjects in <HI>Britain,</HI> of every Denomination, payeth a Tax of <HI>Four Shillings</HI> in the Pound? I wi&s;h this un|precedented and unhappy Circum&s;tance, when laid before his Maje&s;ty, may not occa&s;ion him to think there is &s;ome Rea&s;on to enquire into the Circum&s;tance of Affairs in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
