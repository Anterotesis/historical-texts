<P>"THE Church of England is, in its Con&s;titution, Epi&s;copal. It is, in &s;ome Plantations, con|fe&s;&s;edly the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church; in the re&s;t are many Congregations adhering to it; and through the late Extention of the Briti&s;h Dominions, and the Influence of other cau&s;es, it is likely that there will be more. All Members of every Church are, according to the Principles of Liberty, intitled to every Part of what they conceive to be the Benefits of it, entire and com|pleat, &s;o far as con&s;i&s;ts with the Welfare of civil Government; yet the Members of our Church in America do not thus enjoy its Benefits, having no Prote&s;tant Bi&s;hop within 3000 Miles of them; a Ca&s;e, which never had its Parallel before in the Chri&s;tian World."</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following <HI>Defence</HI> begs Leave to inform his Readers, that it was his De&s;ign not to reply to the Writers again&s;t the <HI>Appeal,</HI> until they &s;hould have offered all they had to &s;ay upon the Subject, as he intended his Defence &s;hould be general. With this View he continued long &s;ilent, waiting patiently for his Turn to be heard, and expecting that a Year's Oppo&s;ition and A|bu&s;e would &s;atisfy his mo&s;t zealous Adver&s;aries. But before the Year was compleated, he was called upon by &s;ome of his Friends, and told, that many were impatient to &s;ee the <HI>general Defence</HI> that had been promi&s;ed, and that to wait any longer upon the <HI>Ame|rican Whig,</HI> who di&s;covered no Signs of coming to|wards a Conclu&s;ion, would be con&s;idered as a Piece of very needle&s;s Complai&s;ance&mdash;e&s;pecially as it was pretty well known what he could &s;ay, from what he had &s;aid in near <HI>50</HI> Papers, and as an <HI>An&s;werer</HI> was ready to reply to every Thing worthy of Notice that he &s;hould &s;ay. Upon this Repre&s;entation the Author proceeded to prepare the following Sheets. He &s;oon found that his chief Difficulty would con&s;i&s;t, in confining a Reply to &s;o many Particulars within a moderate Number of Pages. This Difficulty he counteracted as much as he could, con&s;i&s;tently with his Intention of doing Ju&s;tice to him&s;elf and his Cau&s;e; but &s;till he is much di&s;&s;a|tisfied with the <HI>Length</HI> of his Performance, which he hopes may be forgiven him.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="011203_0004_0F94F93954484A90">THE Author con&s;iders it as his Misfortune that he is brought into &s;uch a Di&s;pute, in this turbulent Sea&s;on. While the Minds of Men are agitated with Conte&s;ts and Jealou&s;ies about political Rights and Pri|vileges, it is not a Time to enter into Controver&s;ies relating to Matters of Religion. It may be &s;aid, who but the Author of the <HI>Appeal</HI> has introduced the Controver&s;y about American Bi&s;hops? He confe&s;&s;es he has occa&s;ioned it; but he is not convinced that he has given any ju&s;t Cau&s;e for the Out-Cry that has been made. He meant no Injury to any human Creature, and fore&s;aw no Oppo&s;ition to what he knew was, in its Nature and Intention, altogether harmle&s;s and in|offen&s;ive. Moreover, when the <HI>Appeal</HI> was drawn up, the Coloni&s;ts were in high good Humor; and when it was publi&s;hed, he was not apprehen&s;ive of the ge|neral Di&s;content that &s;oon followed. Con&s;cious there|fore of his Innocence in this Re&s;pect, he doubts not but the &s;ober and candid will acquit him; and as to the Cen&s;ure or Condemnation of others, although he could wi&s;h to avoid it, it will not greatly di&s;tre&s;s him.</P>
<P>THE Writers again&s;t the <HI>Appeal</HI> have endea|voured to avail them&s;elves of the pre&s;ent Troubles; re|pre&s;enting that the Taxation of the Colonies, and the Propo&s;al of &s;ending Bi&s;hops to America, are Parts of one general Sy&s;tem; and that the latter is as unfriend|ly to our religious, as the former is to our political, Privileges. But their Succe&s;s appears to have been in|adequate to their Wi&s;hes. Very few, it is thought, have been &s;o far blinded as not to &s;ee, that, although the&s;e Things, in the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y, have been art|fully blended together, <HI>they have in Reality no Man|ner of Connection.</HI> And it is well known, that the Di&s;&s;enters in general would not an&s;wer to this Spur, when it was clo&s;ely applied to them, in &s;everal Counties, in the late Elections.</P>

<HEAD>Introductory Ob&s;ervations.</HEAD>
<P>IT is common for tho&s;e who are engaged in public Di&s;putes, to profe&s;s their Aver&s;ion to Controver&s;y. If this Profe&s;&s;ion were needful, I could make it with great Truth and Sincerity. For my natural Di&s;po&s;ition inclines me to comply with, and conform to, the Sentiments of others, as far as I can con&s;i&s;tently, and with a good Con&s;ci|ence, rather than to oppo&s;e them. To this Di&s;po|&s;ition, however, I find that my pre&s;ent Situation is very unfavourable; &s;ince it obliges me to enter into a publick Debate;&mdash;a Debate which will pro|bably be of long Continuance,&mdash;and with a Num|ber of Opponents at the &s;ame Time,&mdash;e&s;pecially with <HI>&s;uch</HI> Opponents as have hitherto exhibited, in Oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Appeal to the Publick in Behalf of the Church of</HI> England <HI>in</HI> America.</P>
<P>WHEN this well-meant <HI>Appeal</HI> was made, the Propo&s;al for an AMERICAN EPISCOPATE as therein explained, appeared to me to be &s;o rea&s;onable, and intirely unexceptionable, that I could <HI>then</HI> as ea&s;ily believe that the Di&s;&s;enters in this Country, who of late Years had di&s;claimed the Principles of Into|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">nce, would generou&s;ly and publickly declare their Approbation of our Plan, as that they would oppo&s;e it with Violence. But knowing that I might po&s;&s;ibly be bia&s;&s;ed in my Judgment, and that Things might not appear to others in the &s;ame Light wherein I viewed them my&s;elf; I intimated (<HI>Page</HI> 2) my Readine&s;s to attend any Objectors,
<PB N="2" REF="011203_0012_0F94F940812428F8">
that might ari&s;e, in a <HI>fair and candid</HI> Debate; and reque&s;ted (<HI>Page</HI> 118) that they would propo&s;e their Objections,
<Q>in &s;uch a charitable and Chri&s;tian Way, that <HI>I</HI> might be the better for them, and <HI>They</HI> not the wor&s;e.</Q>
A Debate has been brought on; how 'fair and candid' on the Part of my Op|ponents, the impartial Reader can judge:&mdash;Ob|jections have been offered; but whether
<Q>in &s;uch a charitable and Chri&s;tian Way</Q>,
that the Objec|tors 'are not the wor&s;e for them', a &s;mall Degree of Self-Examination will enable them be&s;t to judge for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>BEFORE I reply to the <HI>Particulars</HI> objected, it may be proper to make a few general <HI>Introductory</HI> Ob&s;ervations, relating chiefly to the <HI>Manner</HI> where|in I have been oppo&s;ed; which has been different from what, in my humble Conception, I had a Right to expect, in the&s;e &s;everal Re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">1. As the <HI>Appeal</HI> was a <HI>&s;erious</HI> Performance, and its general Subject confe&s;&s;edly of Importance, &s;e|rious An&s;wers, if any, ought to have been given it. But it may be &s;aid of &s;ome of my Opponents, that in&s;tead of giving &s;erious An&s;wers, they have endea|voured to place the whole Matter in Di&s;pute in a ludicrous Light, and have conde&s;cended to act the Part of <HI>Buffoons,</HI> for the Amu&s;ement, rather than of <HI>&s;ober Rea&s;oners,</HI> for the In&s;truction, of the good-natured Reader:&mdash;That, in&s;tead of applying them|&s;elves fairly to convince the Judgment, they have u&s;ed all their Addre&s;s to engage the Prejudices, and inflame the Pa&s;&s;ions, of the Populace, again&s;t the Re&s;idence of Bi&s;hops in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="3" REF="011203_0013_0F94F9412B0C8DB8">2. In Order thereto, the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate has been gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented, the <HI>Appeal</HI> has been perverted, and the Author and his Friends abu&s;ed, with an un&s;paring Hand. If the Plan for the Settlement of Bi&s;hops in <HI>America,</HI> as publi&s;hed in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> was incon&s;i&s;tent with the Rights or Liberties of any Denomination of Chri&s;tians, its Incon&s;i&s;tency &s;hould have been fairly pointed out; and if this had been done with Temper and Decency, it would have had &s;o much the greater Effect, with all rea&s;onable and con&s;iderate Per&s;ons. But every one can &s;ee that this has not been done; and it is one of the fir&s;t Ob&s;ervations that mu&s;t occur to the Reader, that the Epi&s;copate of my Opponents, is not the Epi&s;copate of the <HI>Appeal.</HI> The Character a&s;&s;umed by them requires them to oppo&s;e the <HI>latter</HI>; whereas they have impo&s;ed upon their Readers, in|&s;tead of it, an Epi&s;copate of their own, contrived for the Purpo&s;e of &s;upporting a Clamour. They have loudly and vehemently declaimed, again&s;t the E|&s;tabli&s;hment of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Tyranny in this Land of Liberty again&s;t depriving Men of their reli|gious Freedom and worldly Property, and even of their <HI>natural Rights</HI>; as if the&s;e Evils were con&s;ti|tuent Parts of the Epi&s;copate in Que&s;tion, or at lea&s;t mu&s;t re&s;ult from it by nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence. And yet I &s;ee not how it is po&s;&s;ible, that they &s;hould not know in their own Con&s;ciences, that nothing they have &s;aid in this Strain, militates either again&s;t me, or the Bi&s;hops propo&s;ed. Indeed Pa&s;&s;ages from the <HI>Appeal</HI> have been quoted, to enable them to carry on the Illu&s;ion; but before &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages could an&s;wer the Purpo&s;e, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to put them to the Torture, and to wre&s;t them from their plain and obvious Meaning. As to any per&s;onal Abu&s;es I have received from the&s;e Writers,
<PB N="4" REF="011203_0014_0F94F945290BF710">
I truly de&s;pi&s;e them, and &s;hall &s;ilently pa&s;s them over with the Contempt they de&s;erve. They affect not the Merits of the Cau&s;e in Debate, and are of no Con&s;equence to any but them&s;elves. I never ex|pected much Fame as an Author; and as to my pri|vate or moral Character, I do not conceive, that in the E&s;timation of a &s;ingle Per&s;on who&s;e Opinion is worthy of Regard, it has really received any In|jury, from the malevolent Impeachments of my literary Adver&s;aries.</P>
<P N="3">3.

But, not contented with a &s;ingle Impre&s;|&s;ion of their Publications, they have cau&s;ed them to be <HI>reprinted</HI> in &s;everal of the Colonies.

By this Management, all the bitter Things, and all the unfair Things, as well as all the ludicrous Expre&s;|&s;ions, which they have uttered again&s;t the Church, have been widely circulated among&s;t the People; many of whom are ignorant, &s;ome of them great|ly prejudiced again&s;t us, and perhaps not one in a Hundred of them has ever had an Opportunity, of hearing what is &s;aid on the other Side. Such Con|duct is artful, and has a Tendency to rai&s;e and in|flame a Party; but it can never promote the In|tere&s;ts of Truth and Condour. I may appeal to

Dr. CHAUNCY whether this is generous and fair; who (<HI>Page</HI> 6) pronounces it to be Matter of Com|plaint, when Men are prevented from making a Judgment <HI>upon an impartial hearing of the Ca&s;e,</HI> and are led to give Sentence, upon <HI>hearing one Side only.</HI> Had indeed the Nature of the propo&s;ed E|pi&s;copate been hone&s;tly explained, and the Argu|ments in Favour of it fairly repre&s;ented; in that Ca&s;e, the&s;e periodical Gentlemen might have ob|jected and declaimed, and have publi&s;hed their Ob|jections and Declamations in every Paper upon the Continent, and &s;till their Readers might have been capable of judging of the Matter in Di&s;pute.

<P N="4">4. I HAVE another mo&s;t material Ob&s;ervation to make, of a different Kind, and I reque&s;t of every Reader that he will attend to it; namely, that notwith&s;tanding all the clamorous Oppo&s;ition that has been made to the <HI>Appeal,</HI> the grand Point which was therein &s;ubmitted to the Con&s;ideration of the Public, has been fairly given up by my Opponents. The true State of the Ca&s;e is as follows. After a Plan, for the Introduction of an American Epi&s;copate, for the &s;ole Purpo&s;e of re|lieving the &s;piritual Wants of the Church, had been agreed upon by many of the Bi&s;hops at Home&mdash;after it had been made known to, and had received the Approbation of, &s;everal Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Rank in the Kingdom,&mdash;and had been cor|dially con&s;ented to, by the American Clergy in the northern Colonies; as the utmo&s;t Care had been taken to render it unexceptionable to all Manner
<PB N="6" REF="011203_0016_0F94F947268B9590">
of Per&s;ons, it was thought, that, in Return for the vi&s;ible Abatement of Prejudices again&s;t the Church in the Minds of Di&s;&s;enters, and with a View of removing all po&s;&s;ible Su&s;picions of Evil, it would be received by them as a Mark of Friend|&s;hip, and as a Proof of our candid and generous Di&s;po&s;ition towards them, if we &s;hould unre&s;er|vedly explain this Plan to them before it &s;hould be carried into Execution; declaring at the &s;ame Time our Willingne&s;s to attend to their Objections, &s;hould there be any, again&s;t it. With this De&s;ign the <HI>Appeal to the Public</HI> was undertaken; and therein the PROPOSED EPISCOPATE was fairly and fully explained, and frankly &s;ubmitted to a public Examination and Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Whoever will be at the Trouble of reading the <HI>Appeal</HI> may &s;ee that this was the De&s;ign of it, and that the only Point offered to be debated was, whether it is rea&s;onable that the American Church &s;hould have SUCH AN EPISCOPATE AS IS THEREIN EXPLAINED AND PRO|POSED; and not, whether any Form of an Epi&s;|copate that was not explained nor propo&s;ed, might be liable to Exceptions. For &s;ome Months after this Explanation and Propo&s;al were offered to the Public, there was a dead Silence. Not the lea&s;t Intimation was given in the public Papers, or, &s;o far as I could learn, even in Conver&s;ation, that any were di&s;&s;atisfied. But at length it was di&s;covered, that a Number of Per&s;ons had entered into a Combination to run down the <HI>Appeal,</HI> and vigo|rou&s;ly to oppo&s;e, at any Rate, the Re&s;idence of Bi&s;hops in America; and agreeably to the general Plan of Operations that had been &s;ettled, within the Compa&s;s of a few Weeks, Dr. <HI>Chauncey,</HI> the <HI>American Whig,</HI> and the <HI>Centinel,</HI> made their Ap|pearance. Dr. <HI>Chauncey,</HI> from whom the chief

Execution &s;eems to have been expected, brought on what may be called, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, a regular Attack upon the <HI>Appeal,</HI> openly appearing in his proper Per&s;on. The <HI>American Whig</HI> and the <HI>Centinel</HI> undertook to make as great a Diver&s;ion as they could, in weekly Skirmi&s;hes&mdash;a Number of Volunteers being invited in the mean Time to a&s;&s;i&s;t them by occa&s;ional Sallies. The Operations were carried on with as much Spirit and Warmth as the Friends of the&s;e Adventurers could wi&s;h; but notwith&s;tanding all their Re&s;olution, Alertne&s;s and Caution, they have been obliged to give up the grand Object of the Conte&s;t, as above explained.</P>
<P>DR. CHAUNCEY declares for him&s;elf and his Bre|thren (<HI>Page</HI> 180) in the following Words: <HI>We de&s;ire no other Liberty, than to be left unre&s;trained in the Exerci&s;e of our religious Principles, in &s;o far as we are good Members of Society. And we are perfectly willing Epi&s;copalians &s;hould enjoy this Li|berty to the full. If they think Bi&s;hops, in their appropriated Sen&s;e, were con&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, or his Apo&s;tles, we object not a Word again&s;t their having as many of them as they plea&s;e, if they will be con|tent to have them with Authority altogether de|rived from Chri&s;t.</HI> The good Doctor here &s;peaks immediately to the Point in Que&s;tion, and grants us all that we de&s;ire; in Return for which Ge|nero&s;ity, I heartily wi&s;h that he and his Brethren may always continue <HI>to be left unre&s;trained in the Exerci&s;e of their religious Principles, in &s;o far as they are good Members of Society</HI>; and I have never heard that the Doctor is a bad one. The &s;ame liberal Sentiment he again expre&s;&s;es, but more <HI>la|conically,</HI> in Page 200; <HI>Whoever objected,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>again&s;t this compleat Enjoyment, upon the Footing of a

perfect Equality?</HI> So again in Page 189, <HI>It is not</HI> SIMPLY <HI>the Exerci&s;e of any of their religious Princi|ples that would give the lea&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s, nor yet the Exerci&s;e of them under as many</HI> PURELY SPIRITUAL <HI>Bi&s;hops as they could wi&s;h to have; but their having Bi&s;hops under a</HI> STATE ESTABLISHMENT. And he introduces (<HI>Page</HI> 177) the late Dr. <HI>Mayhew,</HI> as approaching very far towards the &s;ame Conce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>WE are under the like Obligations to the <HI>Ame|rican Whig,</HI> who &s;ays (Numb. 1.) in his own pe|culiar Phra&s;eology, wherein every Man &s;hould be allowed to expre&s;s him&s;elf:
<Q>Tis true, the Pam|phlet (meaning the <HI>Appeal</HI>) is &s;pecious, and appears to a&s;k nothing but what is highly rea|&s;onable; and could any Man, above the Capa|city of an Idiot really per&s;uade him&s;elf, that the Dr. and the Convention would content them&s;elves with a Bi&s;hop, &s;o limited and cur|tailed as he is plea&s;ed to repre&s;ent his future Lord&s;hip; it were manife&s;t Inju&s;tice to deny them what in their Opinion their eternal Sal|vation &s;o greatly depends upon.</Q>
He repeats the &s;ame Conce&s;&s;ion (Numb. XXI.)
<Q>Did they (the Clergy) really de&s;ire, or was there the lea&s;t Probability of obtaining &s;uch an ideal Bi&s;hop as they hold up to public View, in Order to lull us into Security, while them&s;elves are pro&s;ecu|ting their Scheme, for procuring a true modern Prelate, no other Denomination ought in Ju&s;tice to give them any Oppo&s;ition.</Q>
And again (Numb. XXII.)
<Q>The Coloni&s;ts have not as yet that I know of, made any Objections again&s;t the Epi&s;copalians having primitive Bi&s;hops. Such I believe would give no Umbrage to Per|&s;ons of other Denominations.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="011203_0019_0F94F9494C016CE0">THE <HI>Centinel</HI> indeed has not declared him&s;elf &s;o openly and generou&s;ly in our Favour; but yet from &s;undry broken Hints and Intimations inter|&s;per&s;ed up and down his Papers, as well as from the whole Tenor of his Writings, it may be con|cluded, that he differs not from his Fellow-La|bourers above quoted, in &s;o e&s;&s;ential a Point.</P>
<P>NOW from the&s;e Declarations it is evident, that &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as is propo&s;ed in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> will give <HI>no Umbrage</HI> to the Di&s;&s;enters in this Coun|try, and that all the Oppo&s;ition that has been made again&s;t the Settlement of American Bi&s;hops, has been made on the Suppo&s;ition of their being <HI>different</HI> from what we have <HI>held up to public View.</HI> So far as they &s;hall be <HI>the &s;ame,</HI> we cannot now doubt but the Di&s;&s;enters will be &s;atisfied. The Subject has been taken into the clo&s;e&s;t Examination by the Champions of their Party, without the lea&s;t Di&s;|po&s;ition to make us unrea&s;onable Conce&s;&s;ions; and they have declared that <HI>they object not a Word</HI> again&s;t our having Bi&s;hops, if they are not to be inve&s;ted with temporal Authority,&mdash;that <HI>it were manife&s;t Inju&s;tice to oppo&s;e them</HI>&mdash;that <HI>no other Denomination ought in Ju&s;tice to give us Oppo&s;ition,</HI> and the like. So full and authentic a Determination of the Di&s;|&s;enters in Favour of the Epi&s;copate propo&s;ed, it is hoped, will not fail of having its proper Effect on all Sides, both here and at home.</P>
<P>THE Matter being brought to this I&s;&s;ue, I might give up all farther Controver&s;y; were it not that I am thought bound, in <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> to my own Character, to make a more particular Defence of the <HI>Appeal</HI>&mdash; and in <HI>Duty</HI> to the Church of England, to vindi|cate

her from tho&s;e injurious A&s;per&s;ions and Re|proaches, which I have, although very innocently, occa&s;ioned. In Compliance therefore with the&s;e Obligations, I &s;hall go on to con&s;ider the mo&s;t ma|terial Things that have been objected to both, by the Writers with whom I am concerned; and, not|with&s;tanding that <HI>Recrimination is generally allowed to be ju&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall carefully avoid returning <HI>Railing</HI> for <HI>Railing,</HI> as it is but a poor Expedient at be&s;t, and as I am not apprehen&s;ive that I &s;hall have any Manner of Occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>American Whig</HI> made his fir&s;t Exhibi|tion, I promi&s;ed in <HI>an Adverti&s;ement to the Public,</HI> that, although Dr. <HI>Chauncey</HI> would propably be intitled to my principal Attention, yet any other Writers who &s;hould think fit to animadvert on the <HI>Appeal,</HI> &s;hould have &s;uch Notice taken of them, as they &s;hould be found to de&s;erve. From this Pro|mi&s;e, it is very po&s;&s;ible that the <HI>American Whig</HI> and the <HI>Centinel</HI> may be di&s;appointed, in finding they make no greater Figure in the following Defence. But as they have offered very little which has not been as well &s;aid by Dr. <HI>Chauncey,</HI> and as they have both received particular An&s;wers&mdash;the former, in a weekly Paper, intitled, A WHIP <HI>for the American Whig</HI>; and the latter, in another weekly Paper, in|titled, <HI>The Anatomi&s;t</HI>&mdash;I believe I &s;hall not be charg|ed by others with any criminal Neglect. However, Notice will probably be taken of them on &s;ome par|ticular Occa&s;ions. As to the Authors of two ano|nymous Pamphlets aimed at the <HI>Appeal</HI>; one, in the Form of a <HI>Letter,</HI> addre&s;&s;ed to <HI>the Ruler of St. John's Church,</HI> and &s;igned <HI>an Antiepi&s;copalian</HI>; and the other, in the Name of <HI>a Pre&s;byter in Old En|gland</HI>;
<PB N="11" REF="011203_0021_0F94F94ACDD3F678">
I know of no Laws of Ju&s;tice, or Honour, or Decency, that require me to take particular No|tice of them. The <HI>Antiepi&s;copalian</HI> appears to me to be &s;uch a rambling, ignorant, petulant, pedan|tic Writer, and his Piece, through the Blunders of the Printer and tho&s;e of the Author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following cannot be called a <HI>Blunder.</HI> In Page 10, he &s;ays: <HI>When, where, or by whom, has Jones</HI> on the Heart <HI>been refuted, or an&s;wer'd, when he has proved at large</HI>
<Q>That the <HI>Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops</HI> cannot be traced up to the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> as their Original</Q>?
Here the Marks of Quotation are dropped, and he goes on: <HI>Does he not prove that the Succe&s;|&s;ors of</HI> Au&s;tin <HI>the Monk, being almo&s;t entirely extinct,</HI> A.

Now this Pa&s;&s;age is tran&s;cribed from Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI>'s LECTURES (<HI>Page</HI> 501) without giving him the lea&s;t Credit for &s;o important Information. But the Cream of the Je&s;t is yet to come. In this very Pa&s;&s;age, which he has privately tran&s;cribed, Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI> refers to a Note in the Margin, in which Note he &s;ays, that <HI>Jones on the Heart</HI> has been an&s;wered by the <HI>Bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph.</HI></NOTE>, is in &s;ome Parts &s;o unintelligible, that I never can con&s;ent to enter into any public Debate with him. And as to <HI>the Pre&s;byter in Old England,</HI> he &s;eems to know too little of the Matters in Debate, to intitle him to a Hearing. By this Time the Reader &s;ees that my chief Bu&s;ine&s;s is with Dr. <HI>Chauncey</HI>; and this Bu&s;i|ne&s;s I &s;hall now proceed to &s;ettle.</P>
<P>BY Way of Contra&s;t to that <HI>Diffidence</HI> of him|&s;elf, wherewith the Author of the <HI>Appeal</HI> intro|duced him&s;elf to the Public; the Doctor comes for|ward, in <HI>an Adverti&s;ement,</HI> with gigantic <HI>Confidence</HI>; telling his Readers, that the Performance which followed was intirely his own,&mdash;that he had not undertaken it <HI>in Virtue of any voted Appointment by
<PB N="12" REF="011203_0022_0F94F94B877783A8">
a Convention of the Clergy,</HI>&mdash;and, that he was not <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;ted in it as to Method or Management, by Direc|tions from &s;o learned and able a Body of Men.</HI> And, to increa&s;e the Reputation of his Abilities, his Friends have given out<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>American Whig,</HI> Numb.

If any Thing farther was inten|ded by them, than that we &s;hould con&s;ider him as an <HI>able</HI> Writer, and a <HI>ready</HI> Writer, it ought to have been explained. His being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e Two literary Accompli&s;hments, I have no Inclination to di&s;pute. But I am &s;orry, that, at the Age of <HI>Seven|ty,</HI> he could find no better Way of di&s;playing them, than in abu&s;ing the Church of England, and in en|deavouring to di&s;grace the <HI>Appeal.</HI></P>
<P>IN his INTRODUCTION the Doctor complains, that the Arguments made U&s;e of in Support <HI>of our Pe|titions</HI> for American Bi&s;hops, had been <HI>kept &s;ecret,</HI> and &s;ays, <HI>although an authentic Knowledge of them was de&s;ired, it could not be obtained at fir&s;t, and I know not that it ever has been &s;ince.</HI> He &s;eems here to refer to &s;ome formal Application that had been made to our Clergy for this Intelligence, which had been unkindly rejected; but I know nothing either of &s;uch an Application or Rejection. On the contrary, we have generally been de&s;irous of explaining the Rea&s;ons for our reque&s;ting Bi&s;hops, to every one, as we have had Opportunity; and have frequently mentioned the Subject to Di&s;&s;enters, long before any Petitions for that Purpo&s;e were tran&s;mitted or prepared. But the Doctor &s;eems
<PB N="13" REF="011203_0023_0F94F94C963E88C8">
to think that we ought to have <HI>publi&s;hed</HI> our Rea|&s;ons before we &s;ent our Addre&s;&s;es. Others may think it &s;ufficient that they were made known in Con|ver&s;ation, and that all the curious and inqui&s;itive might &s;atisfy them&s;elves by having Recour&s;e to the proper Per&s;ons. But the Complaint is altogether groundle&s;s. For the Plan upon which it was pro|po&s;ed that Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;ent to America, and the <HI>Arguments</HI> afterwards <HI>made U&s;e of in Support of our Petitions,</HI> actually were publi&s;hed, a con&s;idera|ble Time before the Petitions were &s;ent, in <HI>an An|&s;wer to Dr. Mayhew's Ob&s;ervations,</HI> &amp;c. And as many Copies of the <HI>An&s;wer</HI> were &s;ent to Bo&s;ton, and Dr. Mayhew <HI>rejoined</HI> to it, and e&s;pecially as that Controver&s;y engaged the public Attention, it is very &s;urpri&s;ing that Dr. <HI>Chauncey</HI> &s;hould have been &s;o great a Stranger in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as not to have &s;ome Knowledge of it. Afterwards, upon ob&s;erving that many Per&s;ons in the Colonies were &s;till unacquaint|ed with the Nature and De&s;ign of our Application for Bi&s;hops, in which State they were liable to un|favourable Su&s;picions and Jealou&s;ies, it was voted by our <HI>Convention,</HI> that more particular Information &s;hould be publi&s;hed, and the whole Matter ex|plained, for the Satisfaction of all Parties; in Con&s;equence of which, the <HI>Appeal</HI> was drawn up and publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE Doctor's Method of an&s;wering the <HI>Appeal,</HI> by <HI>taking into Con&s;ideration the &s;everal Sections one by one</HI> in their Order, I have no Objections to; and therefore will pur&s;ue the &s;ame Method in defend|ing it. But before I proceed, I think it but fair to adverti&s;e the Reader, that I &s;hall be obliged to con|trovert &s;ome Things which have no more Relation to the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate, than the Di&s;pute be|tween

<P>AT my Entrance upon the Subject, I made the following Ob&s;ervation,
<Q>That the Church of Eng|land is epi&s;copal, and con&s;equently holds the Nece&s;&s;ity of Bi&s;hops to govern the Church, and to confer eccle&s;ia&s;tical Powers;</Q>
and for Proof of it, refered to 'her public Offices,' and to
<Q>the whole Sy&s;tem of her Conduct with Regard to her Clergy.</Q>
The Truth of the Ob&s;ervation Dr. <HI>Chauncey</HI> is plea&s;ed in one Sen&s;e to allow, and in another to deny. But if it be true in any Sen&s;e, it is &s;ufficient for my Purpo&s;e. If it be, according to the Doctor's Notion, by Virtue only of the <HI>Jus humanum</HI> of Epi&s;copacy, that Bi&s;hops are nece&s;&s;ary; &s;till the Ends for which they are nece&s;&s;ary cannot be obtained without them, &s;o long as we are &s;ubject to the Authority that requires them. We com|plain of the Hard&s;hip of being obliged to go 3000 Miles for Ordination, with great Hazard and Expence: Will &s;aying that the Obligation of Epi&s;|copacy in the Church of England, is founded only on the national Authority, relieve us, while we look upon our&s;elves to be bound in Duty and Con|&s;cience to obey that Authority? Or, will it prove that we ought not to be relieved? If it will do neither, we are &s;till in the &s;ame Condition, and have the &s;ame Rea&s;ons for Complaint.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="011203_0027_0F94F951DDBABF90">BUT I humbly conceive the Doctor is greatly mi&s;taken in his Opinion of the Matter, and that, in the long Account he has undertaken to give of the Principles of our Reformers, if he will be &s;o good as for <HI>once</HI> to lend me his favourite Expre&s;|&s;ion, <HI>he does not &s;peak the Truth of Fact.</HI> As the Sub&s;tance of this Account has been copied from the <HI>Irenicum</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following ju&s;t Account of the <HI>Irenicum</HI> has been given by one of our periodical Writers.

<P>THE Doctor excepts again&s;t the <HI>Preface</HI> to the Book of <HI>Ordination,</HI> as a Proof that the Church of England is <HI>epi&s;copal,</HI> in the common Sen&s;e of the Word; becau&s;e, as Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Wiggle&s;worth</HI> had ob&s;erved, there is Rea&s;on to conclude the Compilers of it were of Opinion, that <HI>Prie&s;ts and Bi&s;hops are by God's Law one and the &s;ame. This was certainly,</HI> &s;ays Dr. <HI>Chauncey, the Doctrine of the Church of England in the Beginning of the Reformation, and of the Generality of its pious and learned Divines for a very con&s;iderable Time afterwards.</HI> (Page 8.) He refers to a Book publi&s;hed in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, entitled, "The INSTRUCTION of a Chri&s;tian Man", afterwards altered and reprinted with a &s;omewhat different Title.</P>
<P>LET us fir&s;t &s;ee what the <HI>Preface</HI> to the Ordina|tion Offices, &s;ays. The Words are the&s;e:
<Q>It is evident to all Men diligently reading Holy Scripture, and ancient Authors, that from the Apo&s;tles Time, there have been the&s;e Orders of Mini&s;ters in Chri&s;t's Church; Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Deacons. Which Offices were evermore had in &s;uch reverend E&s;timation, that no Man might pre&s;ume to execute any of them, except he were fir&s;t called, tried, examined, and known to have &s;uch Qualities as are requi&s;ite for the &s;ame; and al&s;o by publick Prayer, with Impo|&s;ition of Hands, were approved and admitted thereunto by lawful Authority. And therefore, to the Intent that the&s;e Orders may be continued, and reverently u&s;ed and e&s;teemed, in the Church of England; no Man &s;hall be accounted or
<PB N="19" REF="011203_0029_0F94F95516466098">
taken to be a lawful Bi&s;hop, Prie&s;t or Deacon, in the Church of England, or &s;uffered to execute any of the &s;aid Functions, except he be called, tried, examined, and admitted thereunto, accor|ding to the Form hereafter following, or hath had formerly epi&s;copal Con&s;ecration, or Ordina|tion.</Q></P>
<P>IF the Reader now will carefully con&s;ider this Pa&s;&s;age, let him &s;ay, whether it is ea&s;y to <HI>conceive</HI> a more direct, po&s;itive and compleat Te&s;timony in Favour of Epi&s;copacy, than is here given by the Compilers of the <HI>Ordinal.</HI> The <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> of the three Orders, of Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Deacons, is in this <HI>Preface</HI> fully a&s;&s;erted;&mdash;the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of this Di&s;tinction is deduced
<Q>from the Apo&s;tles Time;</Q>
&mdash;the <HI>Evidence</HI> in Favour of it is &s;aid to be contained in "holy Scripture and ancient Authors," &mdash;and the <HI>Clearne&s;s</HI> of this Evidence is &s;uch, that it mu&s;t appear
<Q>to <HI>all Men</HI> diligently reading holy Scripture, &amp;c.</Q>
In Con&s;equence of this Doctrine,
<Q>no Man is to be accounted a lawful Bi&s;hop, Prie&s;t, or Deacon, in the Church of England, or &s;uf|fered to execute any of the &s;aid Functions, ex|cept he be admitted thereunto, according to the Form</Q>
then e&s;tabli&s;hed; with a farther Excepti|on in Favour of tho&s;e only, who had received "formerly epi&s;copal Con&s;ecration, or Ordination." If the Doctor can di&s;cover no more in the&s;e De|clarations concerning Epi&s;copacy, than that they <HI>may &s;eem to have an A&s;pect this Way</HI>; &s;uch Pre|judice will go far towards accounting for the many Mi&s;repre&s;entations he has made, in his <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to the <HI>Appeal.</HI> But to enable him to make a more im|partial Judgment of the Matter, I beg of him to try an ea&s;y Experiment, which is no other than
<PB N="20" REF="011203_0030_0F94F9556154A378">
this; whether, with all the Explanations and &s;often|ing Interpretations that the Words will admit of, he is able him&s;elf, hone&s;tly and con&s;i&s;tently, to &s;ub&s;cribe to this Declaration of our fir&s;t Reformers. If he cannot, he mu&s;t allow them to have enter|tained other Sentiments of Epi&s;copacy, than he has repre&s;ented them to have had&mdash;unle&s;s he can &s;up|po&s;e them to be guilty of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Deceit and Prevarication.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;ays the Doctor,
<Q>that Prie&s;ts and Bi&s;hops were the &s;ame,</Q>
CERTAINLY <HI>was the Doctrine of the Church of England in the Beginning of the Re|formation</HI>; (Ibid.) meaning when the Ordination Offices were compo&s;ed; or it is impertinent to his Argument. But the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England</HI> concerning Epi&s;copacy, is <HI>certainly</HI> to be learnt from her public Offices and Acts, rather than from the &s;uppo&s;ed Sentiments of Individuals. For how incredible is it, that different Offices &s;hould have been compo&s;ed for the Ordination of Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts, if they were both con&s;idered as being in Reality but one Order? If every Prie&s;t was believed to be already a Bi&s;hop, would Men, who had any Con&s;ciences, con&s;ent to act the &s;olemn Farce of ordaining &s;uch an one to the epi&s;copal Office, with Prayer and the Impo&s;ition of Hands? Would they &s;olemnly invoke the Almighty for his Ble&s;&s;ing upon them in communicating tho&s;e &s;piri|tual Powers, which they had no Intention to com|municate, as the Per&s;on was believed to be fully inve&s;ted with them already? How injurious to the Characters of our excellent Reformers, is the mo&s;t di&s;tant In&s;inuation of &s;uch Duplicity of Conduct!</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="011203_0031_0F94F95626FADDD8">BUT &s;till the Doctor, it &s;eems, is clear in the Matter; The fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reformers <HI>certainly</HI> were not Epi&s;copalians. If po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertions are to be admitted as Evidence in this Di&s;pute, I can pro|duce, from the mo&s;t re&s;pectable Authors, innu|merable Witne&s;&s;es on the other Side. Bi&s;hop <HI>Ken|net,</HI> as moderate a Man, as candid a Writer, and as well acquainted with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, as Doctor <HI>Chauncey,</HI> &s;ays, that

<P>BUT let us proceed to Evidence of another Na|ture. The Book intitled
<Q>The godly and pious INSTITUTION of a Chri&s;tian Man,</Q>
was publi&s;hed 1537, in the early <HI>Infancy,</HI> or rather &s;oon after the fir&s;t <HI>Conception,</HI> of the Reformation. It was drawn up by <HI>Cranmer</HI> and others, agreed to by both Hou&s;es of Convocation, publi&s;hed with the King's Appro|bation, and intended as a Standard of Doctrine for the Bi&s;hops and Clergy. The Book it&s;elf I have never &s;een; but <HI>Collier</HI> has given an <HI>Ab&s;tract</HI> of the
<PB N="22" REF="011203_0032_0F94F956CFF455D8">
mo&s;t material Parts of it. In this Ab&s;tract there is nothing like what the Doctor would prove from it; but there is &s;omething extremely <HI>unlike</HI> it in the following Pa&s;&s;age: "They proceed (&s;ays <HI>Collier,</HI> &s;peaking of the Authors of that Book)
<Q>to a more particular Explanation of the Authority of the Clergy, and divide it into two Branches, <HI>Po|te&s;tas Ordinis, et Pote&s;tas Juri&s;dictionis.</HI> Concerning the Fir&s;t, <HI>not being conte&s;ted,</HI> they &s;ay nothing; the Latter, touching Juri&s;diction committed by God to the Hierarchy, they throw it into three Subdivi&s;ions. By the Fir&s;t, they are impowered to reprove Immorality and Mi&s;belief, and to ex|communicate the Ob&s;tinate and incorrigible.&mdash;By the &s;econd Branch of Juri&s;diction, BISHOPS <HI>are authori&s;ed by our Saviour to</HI> CONTINUE the SUC|CESSION <HI>and</HI> PERPETUATE <HI>the Hierarchy.</HI> They are the Judges of the Qualifications for Prie&s;t|hood, and may admit or refu&s;e as they think fit.&mdash; A third Branch of Juri&s;diction belonging to Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts, comprehends the Power of making Canons for the Di&s;cipline and Service of the Church.</Q>
The Hi&s;torian, at the Conclu&s;ion of his Ab&s;tract, gives the Li&s;t of Sub&s;cribers, and takes Leave, with the following Remark:
<Q>This Book, in the Sacrament of <HI>Orders,</HI> declares the Clergy have their Commi&s;&s;ion from God Almigh|ty, and by Con&s;equence, that their Authority is no Grant of the <HI>Crown.</HI></Q></P>
<P>A FEW Years afterwards was publi&s;hed,
<Q>a ne|ce&s;&s;ary Doctrine and ERUDITION of a Chri&s;tian Man,</Q>
to which the King him&s;elf wrote a Pre|face. It was for Sub&s;tance much the &s;ame with the INSTITUTION, but enlarged and altered in &s;everal Particulars: From whence it is evident that at this
<PB N="23" REF="011203_0033_0F94F9578B36B270">
Period, the religious Principles of the Nation were in an un&s;ettled, fluctuating State. In the Account given of the ERUDITION by the &s;ame Hi&s;torian, there is &s;omething indeed to the Doctor's Purpo&s;e; for therein we are told, that
<Q>after mention made of the Appointment of Deacons</Q>
in this Book,
<Q>it is &s;ubjoined, that the Scripture &s;peaks expre&s;sly of no more than the two Orders of Prie&s;ts and Deacons.</Q>
Were we to &s;top here, we &s;hould infer that the Reformers at this Time, were not proper|ly Epi&s;copalians, but Pre&s;byterians. But in another Pa&s;&s;age under the &s;ame Head, they have the Ap|pearance, not of Pre&s;byterians, but of Epi&s;copa|lians. Take the Words of my Author:
<Q>The ERUDITION makes <HI>Orders</HI> one of the &s;even Sa|craments, and defines it a Gift of Grace for Ad|mini&s;tration in the Church; that it is conveyed by Con&s;ecration and Impo&s;ition of the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI>'s Hands; that in the Beginning of Chri&s;tianity, this Character was given by the Apo&s;tles. The Proof is drawn from the Epi&s;tles of St. <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus.</HI></Q>
How to reconcile the&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ages, may be difficult; and until this be done, they can prove but little on either Side. <HI>Collier</HI> &s;ays, that
<Q>under tho&s;e called Prie&s;ts or Pre&s;byters, this Book &s;uppo&s;es the epi&s;copal Character was meant; for, that the&s;e two Orders were di&s;tinct and &s;ubordinate, <HI>is plain from this</HI> ERUDITION.</Q>
He concludes with ob&s;erving, that
<Q>this la&s;t Book does not &s;tand upon &s;o &s;trong an Authority as the former. The INSTITUTION was the Act of the whole Clergy, and &s;ub&s;cribed by both Hou&s;es of Convocation.</Q>
But the "nece&s;&s;ary ERUDITION," was drawn up only by a Committee of
<Q>the King's Nomination.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="011203_0034_0F94F958A738BDB0">BUT the true State of the Ca&s;e appears to me to have been this: At the Time of the ERUDI|TION, <HI>Cranmer</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociates were generally agreed in the&s;e two main Points; that the national Religion was gro&s;sly corrupted, and that a public Reformation was nece&s;&s;ary. But how <HI>far</HI> either was the Ca&s;e, was the Work of Time to determine. <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin</HI> had made great Progre&s;s in <HI>Ger|many</HI> and &s;ome Places adjacent; but they differed con&s;iderably in their Sy&s;tems; neither of which could &s;afely be adopted, without a careful Exami|nation. Be&s;ides, in the Heat of their Conte&s;t, they were &s;uppo&s;ed to have run into &s;ome Extremes, which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Divines judged it prudent to a|void. Our Reformers therefore were re&s;olved to proceed with the utmo&s;t Caution. And the Me|thod they appear to have pur&s;ued was, to con&s;ider one Doctrine after another with the clo&s;e&s;t Attenti|on, until the whole Sy&s;tem &s;hould be examined, and placed on the &s;ure Ba&s;is of Scripture Authori|ty. While this &s;low and important Work was going on, the INSTITUTION and ERUDITION were pub|li&s;hed for <HI>temporary</HI> U&s;e. Some of the Doctrines in Di&s;pute between the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> and the <HI>German</HI> Reformers, had been fully canva&s;&s;ed and determined by <HI>Cranmer</HI> and his Friends. Others were not yet thoroughly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; among which mu&s;t be reckoned that of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government. This may fairly be concluded from the <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> propo&s;ed to <HI>an A&s;&s;embly of</HI> SELECT <HI>Divines,</HI> as the Doctor properly calls them p. 9; <HI>to which Que&s;ti|ons they gave in &s;everally their Re&s;olutions in Papers, all who&s;e Judgments were accurately &s;ummed up, and &s;et down by the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury him&s;elf.</HI> For it was at this Time, and not ten Years after|wards, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> VI, as Doctor
<PB N="25" REF="011203_0035_0F94F95917C07990">
<HI>Chauncey,</HI> following his blind Guide the <HI>Irenicum,</HI> a&s;&s;erts, that tho&s;e <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> were given out for Di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, as is plain from Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet.</HI></P>
<P>AT this Stage of the Reformation therefore it is no Wonder, that we meet with &s;ome crude Expe&s;&s;ions, relating to Epi&s;copacy; as well as to many other Matters of the highe&s;t Importance. The Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Education &s;till ope|rated in the Minds of the&s;e hone&s;t Searchers for Truth; and it was owing perhaps more to the Force of the&s;e Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, than to any other Cau&s;e, that &s;ome of them have u&s;ed Expre&s;&s;ions, which have &s;ince been con&s;trued to imply their having &s;ome Doubts concerning the Superiority of Bi&s;hops over Pre&s;byters. The <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Schoolmen and Ca|noni&s;ts had been for &s;ome Ages endeavouring to de|&s;troy the Di&s;tinction between the two Orders; of which Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI> gives a particular Account<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Ref. Vol. I. p. 366.</NOTE>, concluding it in the&s;e Words:
<Q>On this I have in&s;i&s;ted the more, that it may appear how little they have con&s;idered Things, who are &s;o far car|ried with their Zeal again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed Go|vernment of the Church, as to make U&s;e of &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages of the Schoolmen and Canoni&s;ts that deny them to be di&s;tinct Orders; for the&s;e are <HI>the very Dregs of Popery,</HI> the one rai&s;ing the Prie&s;ts higher for the Sake of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, the other pulling the Bi&s;hops lower for the Sake of the Pope's Supremacy, and by &s;uch Means bringing them almo&s;t to an Equality.</Q>
The like Ob&s;ervation was before made by an eminent Archbi|&s;hop, who &s;ays:
<Q>We may ju&s;tly a&s;cribe the reviving of the <HI>A&euml;rian</HI> Here&s;y in the&s;e latter Days, to the Di&s;pen&s;ations of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> who licen&s;ed
<PB N="26" REF="011203_0036_0F94F959C68FA060">
ordinary Prie&s;ts to <HI>ordain,</HI> and <HI>confirm,</HI> and do the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Offices of Bi&s;hops. So their Schools do teach us, <HI>a Prie&s;t may be the extraor|dinary Mini&s;ter of Prie&s;thood, and inferior Orders by the Delegation of the Pope.</HI> Again, <HI>The Pope may confer the Power of Confirmation upon a &s;imple Prie&s;t.</HI> By &s;uch exhorbitant Practices as the&s;e, they chalked out a Way to Innovators. And yet they are not able to produce a Precedent of &s;uch Di&s;pen&s;ation throughout the primitive Times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bramhall's Works, p. 431.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>BUT to come to the <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> and <HI>Re&s;olutions,</HI> Extracts from which make &s;o great a Figure in the <HI>Irenicum:</HI> The Manu&s;cript is publi&s;hed at large by <HI>Burnet</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Re<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. Vol. I. Collection, p. 201.</NOTE>, excepting an Omi&s;&s;ion to be mentioned pre&s;ently. Therein we find <HI>Cranmer</HI>'s An&s;wer to the 10th Que&s;tion, in the Words quoted by the Doctor; but the Reader will not forget the <HI>Time</HI> of his giv|ing this An&s;wer, which was about <HI>ten</HI> Years before our pre&s;ent Offices for Ordination were compo&s;ed. However &s;trange <HI>Cranmer</HI>'s Opinion may appear to have been at this Time, there is &s;trong Proof that he altered it immediately. For in the &s;ame Copy of Que&s;tions and Re&s;olutions, Dr. <HI>Leighton</HI>'s An|&s;wer to the 11th Que&s;ton is:
<Q>I &s;uppo&s;e that a Bi&s;hop hath Authority of God, as his Mini&s;ter, by Scripture to make a Prie&s;t; but he ought not to admit any Man to be a Prie&s;t, and con&s;e|crate him, or to appoint him to any Mini&s;try in the Church, without the Prince's Licence and Con&s;ent. And that any other Man hath Au|thority to make a Prie&s;t by Scripture, I have not read, nor any Example therof.</Q>
To the 12th Que&s;tion <HI>Leighton</HI> an&s;wers:
<Q>I &s;uppo&s;e that there
<PB N="27" REF="011203_0037_0F94F95CF39BCAC0">
is a Con&s;ecration required, as by Impo&s;ition of Hands; for &s;o we be taught in the En&s;ample of the Apo&s;tles.</Q>
Now <HI>Durell</HI> in his <HI>Vindiciae</HI> &s;ays, that having had an Opportunity of examining the ori|ginal Manu&s;cript, he found that <HI>Cranmer gave his Con&s;ent to the&s;e two Opinions of Leighton,</HI> &s;ub&s;crib|ing to each <HI>Th: Cantuarien&s;is</HI>; which very material Information is omited by Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lowth, on the Subject of Church-Power, p. 484.</NOTE>. Why <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> left out this Pa&s;&s;age is plain; it inter|fered with the De&s;ign of his <HI>Irenicum:</HI> But why <HI>Burnet</HI> omited it is doubtful. For that he had no Intention to tran&s;mit <HI>Cranmer</HI>'s Character to Po&s;te|rity as <HI>Era&s;tian,</HI> is evident from his Remark in the Body of his Hi&s;tory.
<Q>In <HI>Cranmer</HI>'s Paper, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> &s;ome &s;ingular Opinions of his about the Na|ture of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Offices will be found; but as they are delivered by him with all po&s;&s;ible Mode&s;ty, &s;o they are not e&s;tabli&s;hed as the Doc|trine of the Church, but laid a&s;ide as particular Conceits of his own, and it &s;eems that <HI>after|wards he changed his Opinion.</HI> For he &s;ub&s;cribed the Book that was &s;oon after &s;et out, which is <HI>directly contrary</HI> to tho&s;e Opinions &s;et down in the&s;e Papers.</Q>
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 289.</NOTE></P>
<P>DR. <HI>Chauncey</HI> proceeds: <HI>The Bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, Dr. Thirleby, Dr. Redmayn and Cox, were all of the &s;ame Opinion with the Archbi&s;hop, viz. that</HI>
<Q>Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts were at one Time, and were not two Things, but one Office in the Beginning of Chri&s;t's Reli|gion.</Q>
I &s;ee no great Heterodoxy in this Opinion, if properly explained. It is now generally agreed by the Advocates for Epi&s;copacy, that <HI>in the Beginning of Chri&s;t's Religion,</HI> Bi&s;hops, and Prie&s;ts or Pre&s;by|ters, were &s;ynonymous Terms: Con&s;equently, they
<PB N="28" REF="011203_0038_0F94F95EDCD8FAB0">
<HI>were at one Time,</HI> and <HI>not two Things.</HI> But the Word <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> in the 11th Que&s;tion, &s;eems to have been under&s;tood in its <HI>appropriated</HI> Sen&s;e. The Que&s;tion is, <HI>Whether a Bi&s;hop hath Authority to make a Prie&s;t by the Scripture, or no? And whether any other but only a Bi&s;hop may make a Prie&s;t?</HI> To this Dr. <HI>Cox</HI> an&s;wers:
<Q>Bi&s;hops have Authority, as is afore&s;aid, of the Apo&s;tles, in the 10th Que&s;|tion, to make Prie&s;ts, except in Ca&s;es of great Nece&s;&s;ity.</Q>
In his An&s;wer to the 10th Que&s;tion, to which he refers, he had made this Di&s;tinction, <HI>Bi&s;hops as they be</HI> NOW, <HI>i. e.</HI> as &s;uperior to Pre&s;by|ters; in which Sen&s;e therefore he a&s;&s;erts in this Place, that they <HI>have Authority to make Prie&s;ts.</HI> Dr. <HI>Redmayn</HI> an&s;wers the Que&s;tion thus:
<Q>To the fir&s;t Part, I an&s;wer, YEA; for &s;o it appear|eth, <HI>Tit.</HI> i. and 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> v. with other Places of Scripture. But whether any other but only a Bi|&s;hop may make a Prie&s;t, I have not read, but by &s;ingular Privilege of God.&mdash;As for <HI>making,</HI> that is to &s;ay, ordaining and con&s;ecrating of Prie&s;ts, I think it &s;pecially belongeth to the Of|fice of a Bi&s;hop, as far as can be &s;hewn by Scrip|ture, or any Example, as I &s;uppo&s;e from the Beginning;</Q>
and with him agree <HI>Thirleby, Sym|mons, Robert&s;on, Leighton</HI> and others. In &s;hort, they generally agree in an&s;wering <HI>affirmatively</HI> to the fir&s;t Part, and <HI>negatively</HI> to the &s;econd Part, of the Que&s;tion; an Exception being made by &s;ome of them for Ca&s;es of great Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>BUT let us return to Dr. <HI>Chauncey: In this &s;ame Reign</HI> (of <HI>Edward</HI> VI.) <HI>in a public Declaration, &s;ub&s;cribed by the Archbi&s;hops of Canterbury and York, eleven Bi&s;hops, and many other Doctors and Civilians, it is expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted, that</HI>
<Q>in the New-Te&s;tament
<PB N="29" REF="011203_0039_0F94F9603840D930">
no mention is made of any Degrees, or Di&s;tinc|tion of Orders, but only of Deacons or Mini&s;ters, and of Prie&s;ts or Bi&s;hops;</Q>
for which we are re|fered to <HI>Burnet</HI> and <HI>Neal.</HI> I &s;hall not trouble my|&s;elf or my Reader with <HI>Neal,</HI> who generally follows the <HI>Irenicum</HI> in the&s;e Matters. As to <HI>Burnet,</HI> upon con&s;ulting him I find the <HI>Declaration</HI> here menti|oned, copied-from a Manu&s;cript in the <HI>Cotton</HI> Li|brary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. Addenda, p. 321.</NOTE>. It is entitled, <HI>A Declaration made of the Functions and divine In&s;titution of Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts.</HI> But how the Doctor could a&s;cribe it to the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> VI, after examining Bi&s;hop <HI>Bur|net</HI> on the Subject, is inconceivable. It has evi|dent internal Marks of its being of a more ancient Date; and the Bi&s;hop puts it as far back in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, as 1538 at lea&s;t, and <HI>proves</HI> that it could not have been made later than the <HI>Be|ginning</HI> of the Year he a&s;&s;igns. For it was &s;ub|&s;cribed by <HI>Edward Fox,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hereford,</HI> who died in <HI>May</HI> 1538. This Declaration therefore will not be admitted as an Evidence, that the Refor|mers <HI>in the Reign of Edward</HI> VI, believed diffe|rently from what they expre&s;&s;ed in the public Offices.</P>
<P>Our Adver&s;aries have often boa&s;ted of late, that our great Reformer <HI>Cranmer</HI> was altogether in their Sentiments, concerning the Origin and Nature of Epi&s;copacy. But I tru&s;t &s;ufficient has been &s;aid to prove, that they have no ju&s;t Rea&s;ons for Triumph, on this Account. Time was when <HI>Cranmer</HI> was a Papi&s;t, and believed the Doctrine of Tran&s;ub&s;tanti|ation. This, with the other di&s;tingui&s;hing Doctrines of Popery, he renounced by Degrees; in Con&s;e|quence of an hone&s;t and faithful Examination of
<PB N="30" REF="011203_0040_0F94F9615570E440">
them in Succe&s;&s;ion, one after another. Is it then fair, or can it be reconciled with that common Ju&s;|tice which is due to him as a Man, to &s;ay nothing of his eminent Character, to alledge again&s;t him in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> VI, after he had firmly &s;et|led him&s;elf upon prote&s;tant Principles, any Opi|nions he entertained <HI>before</HI> he was a Prote&s;tant? At the Time indeed when he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, in the Manner that has been mentioned, on the Sub|ject of Epi&s;copacy, he was not a Papi&s;t; but it may be &s;aid with equal Truth and Propriety, that he was not <HI>yet</HI> a compleat Prote&s;tant. In Regard to &s;ome Points, he was &s;till under the Influence of old Prejudices, and of the Impre&s;&s;ions he had re|ceived from the Schoolmen and Canoni&s;ts; from which however it was not long before he perfectly di&s;engaged him&s;elf. After the Time of his &s;ub|&s;cribing to Dr. <HI>Leighton</HI>'s Opinions concerning E|pi&s;copacy, I find in him no Fluctuation of Princi|ples; but many Proofs appear of his &s;ettled and &s;teady Belief that Bi&s;hops are &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters, by apo&s;tolical In&s;titution. In 1548, he compiled a <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI> or
<Q>large In&s;truction of young Per&s;ons in the Grounds of the Chri&s;tian Religion;</Q>
in which, if we may believe Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet,</HI>
<Q>he <HI>fully</HI> owns the <HI>divine</HI> In&s;titution of Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts.</Q>
In this Book the Archbi&s;hop al&s;o pub|li&s;hed his Sermon, <HI>of the Authority of the Keys,</HI> upon <HI>Rom.</HI> x.13, 14, 15. in which Sermon his Notions of Epi&s;copacy and Church-Government are &s;o high, that even the <HI>high-flying</HI> Dr. <HI>Hicks,</HI> as &s;ome have called him, reprinted it at large, in his Pre|face to <HI>The divine Right of Epi&s;copacy a&s;&s;erted.</HI> Now let it be remembred, that this Sermon was publi&s;hed in 1548&mdash;that the <HI>Ordinal</HI> was compiled in 1550&mdash;and that <HI>Cranmer</HI> was the principal Per&s;on
<PB N="31" REF="011203_0041_0F94F96357B4F458">
concerned in that Work; and then let it be judged, whether, according to my <HI>An&s;werer,</HI> the Con&s;idera|tion <HI>who were the Compilers of that Work,</HI> will in the lea&s;t contribute to overthrow my Po&s;ition,
<Q>that the Church of <HI>England</HI> is epi&s;copal, and con&s;equently holds the Nece&s;&s;ity of Bi&s;hops to govern the Church, and to confer eccle&s;ia&s;tical Powers.</Q></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Cranmer,</HI> I might go on to vindicate the <HI>Sincerity</HI> of the other Compilers of the <HI>Ordinal,</HI> from the &s;ame injurious Impeachment; but I have already exceeded the Limits I propo&s;ed for this Subject, and I imagine what has been offered is &s;uf|ficient to &s;atisfy all <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> Per&s;ons&mdash;and it is vain to attempt the Conviction of others.</P>
<P>FROM the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> VI, the Doctor carries us to <HI>the Days of Queen Elizabeth,</HI> p. 11; when according to him, <HI>it was only determined, in</HI>
<Q><HI>the Articles of Religion agreed upon,</HI> to be agree|able to God's Word;</Q>
which &s;eems to be all that he can di&s;cover in Favour of Epi&s;copacy. But does <HI>he</HI> not &s;peak, in this very Pa&s;&s;age, of Queen <HI>Elizabeth's Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Church Government?</HI> Now what Form of Church-Government did She <HI>re-e&s;tabli&s;h,</HI> but that Form which had been before e&s;tabli&s;hed by <HI>Edward</HI> VI? And has not this been &s;hewn to be truly epi&s;copal? Is not then the <HI>Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> of Epi&s;copacy &s;omewhat more than a bare <HI>Determination,</HI> mentioned in <HI>the Articles of Religion agreed upon</HI>; altho' it is there only &s;aid to be "agreeable to God's Word?" Neither is this, as the Author of the <HI>Irenicum</HI> thought it, <HI>a low and diminutive Expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> when advanced in Oppo&s;i|tion to tho&s;e who denied it to be
<Q>agreeable to God's
<PB N="32" REF="011203_0042_0F94F963929E0590">
Word.</Q>
For if Epi&s;copacy be <HI>agreeable</HI> to Scrip|ture, &s;o far as any Form of Church-Government is directly <HI>oppo&s;ite</HI> to Epi&s;copacy, it is <HI>contrary</HI> to Scripture. If this were &s;aid of that particular Form for which the Doctor is an Advocate, how|ever <HI>diminutive</HI> he might e&s;teem it, I fancy he would not con&s;ider it as a <HI>low</HI> Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT we need not have been detained with the foregoing Particulars; for we are more roundly told, p. 12, that <HI>this Notion of the Right of Bi&s;hops to govern and ordain, as being Officers in the Church, &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters by divine Appointment, was, as the excellent Mr.</HI> J. Owen <HI>&s;ays,</HI>
<Q>FIRST promoted in the Church of England, by Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud.</HI></Q>
This, Dr. <HI>Chauncey</HI> calls <HI>the plain Truth,</HI> and would doubtle&s;s have us receive it as the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth. But of all <HI>plain</HI> Truths, this is the mo&s;t <HI>my&s;terious.</HI> There may indeed be &s;ome &s;ecret Meaning in the Word <HI>promoted,</HI> which I do not comprehend; but until it be unfolded, I mu&s;t take the Liberty to believe that the national E&s;ta|bli&s;hment of this Doctrine, again and again, and making it a fundamental Principle of our Reforma|tion, was doing &s;omething to <HI>promote</HI> it. If the Meaning be, that none before Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud,</HI> contended for the Superiority of Bi&s;hops over Pre&s;byters by <HI>divine Appointment,</HI> in their Writings or publick Di&s;putations; &s;till I mu&s;t deny it, as I am able to produce abundant Evidence to the con|trary. Among the fir&s;t Set of Engli&s;h Reformers, the Doctrine of Epi&s;copacy was not di&s;puted, other|wi&s;e than in the Way of friendly Enquiry, which &s;oon ended in a general Con&s;ent to the Doctrine. Soon after the Acce&s;&s;ion of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it was received and e&s;tabli&s;hed as a Doctrine fairly
<PB N="33" REF="011203_0043_0F94F9645DE2C1C0">
&s;ettled by the venerable Reformers of King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Reign, without a particular Re-examination. When the Engli&s;h Exiles returned, among&s;t the foreign Prejudices imported from <HI>Frankfort</HI> and <HI>Geneva,</HI> we find no fixed Di&s;affection towards epi&s;copal Govern|ment. For even <HI>Calvin</HI> him&s;elf had no Objections to a moderate Epi&s;copacy, &s;uch as that of the Church of England. Some of the&s;e Per&s;ons &s;crup|led wearing the Habits, objected to the Terms of Conformity, and caviled about &s;ome Parts of the Liturgy. For &s;everal Years the&s;e were the only Subjects of Debate between the Church and the <HI>Puritans,</HI> as they were now called; and it is not to be expected that, during this Period, we &s;hould find any elaborate Defences of epi&s;copal Govern|ment. But afterwards, when the Hierarchy came to be formally attacked by <HI>Cartwright, Udal, Penry,</HI> and the other <HI>Whigs</HI> and <HI>Centinels</HI> of that Reign, it was vigorou&s;ly defended upon the Footing of a <HI>divine Appointment.</HI> Even Mr. <HI>Neal</HI> allows, that the Validity of Ordination by Pre&s;byters began to be di&s;puted and denied, towards the Middle of this Reign.
<Q><HI>Whitgift,</HI> &s;ays he, was the fir&s;t that de|fended the Hierarchy, from the Practice of the third, fourth, and fifth Centuries, when the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Empire became Chri&s;tian; but <HI>Bancroft</HI> divided off the Bi&s;hops from the Prie&s;thood, and advanced them into a &s;uperior Order by <HI>divine Right,</HI> with the &s;ole Power of Ordination, and the Keys of Di&s;cipline; &s;o that from his Time there were reckoned Three Orders of Clergy in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hierarchy, viz. Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Deacons.</Q>
He al&s;o &s;ays,
<Q>the Queen and the later Bi&s;hops would not part with a Pin out of the Hierarchy <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Puritans, Vol. I. p. 467, <HI>Dublin</HI> Edit.</NOTE>.</Q>
From whence it is evident,
<PB N="34" REF="011203_0044_0F94F96506062510">
that whatever <HI>the excellent Mr.</HI> J. Owen may have thought, or Dr. <HI>Chauncey</HI> may now think, it was not the Opinion of their great puritanical Hi&s;to|rian, that the Doctrine of Epi&s;copacy by <HI>divine Appointment,</HI> was FIRST <HI>promoted in the Church of England by Archbi&s;hop Laud.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t regular Attack upon the Hierarchy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> was made by the Puritans in 1572, in their <HI>Admonition to the Parliament</HI>; the De&s;ign of which, among other Things, was to &s;ubvert the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government by Bi&s;hops. Dr. <HI>Whitgift,</HI> then Vice-Chancellor of the Uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> was thought to be a proper Per&s;on to give "an An&s;wer" to it. Upon this Service he was put by Archbi&s;hop <HI>Parker,</HI> and he performed it with great Approbation and Applau&s;e. <HI>Strype</HI> &s;ays of his An&s;wer, that it was an
<Q>excel|lent Book, containing a very learned and &s;atis|factory Vindication of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the U&s;ages thereof, and e&s;pecially of the Government of it by Bi&s;hops<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Life of <HI>Whitgift,</HI> p. 33.</NOTE>.</Q>
We al&s;o learn from the &s;ame Hi&s;torian, that
<Q>as Archbi&s;hop <HI>Parker</HI> was the chief Per&s;on that &s;et <HI>Whitgift</HI> about this Work, &s;o he gave him con&s;iderable A&s;&s;i&s;tance therein, and the &s;everal Parts of the Copy, as it was fini&s;hed, were &s;ent to him from Time to Time, to review: And <HI>Cooper,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> another of our learnede&s;t Bi&s;hops, together with other Bi&s;hops and learned Men, were con&s;ulted withal.&mdash;So that this Book may be ju&s;tly e&s;teemed and applied to, as one of the public Books of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> con|cerning her Profe&s;&s;ion and Principles; being of the like Authority, in Re&s;pect to its Wor&s;hip

Upon what Principle he defended the Government of the Church by Bi&s;hops, we may learn from Sir <HI>F. Knoliys,</HI> a great Patron of the Puritans; who &s;ome Years afterwards, &s;peaking of Dr. <HI>Whitgift</HI>'s Writings in this Controver&s;y, complains that he
<Q>had claimed, in the Right of all Bi&s;hops, a Su|periority belonging to them, over all the inferior Clergy from God's own Ordinance<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 342.</NOTE>.</Q>
In 1583 Dr. <HI>Whitgift</HI> was promoted from the See of <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter</HI> to that of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in which he continued for many Years, giving frequent Proofs of his &s;teady Adherence to the &s;ame Principles with Re|gard to Epi&s;copacy. I will content my&s;elf with laying before the Reader, the following remarkable In&s;tance. In 1593, he wrote a long Letter to <HI>Beza,</HI> expo&s;tulating with him for intermedling, in the Manner he had done, in the Di&s;putes between the Church of <HI>England</HI> and the Puritans; in which Letter is a Pa&s;&s;age, which I will take the Freedom to recommend to the &s;erious Attention of Dr. <HI>Chauncey,</HI> as it will tend to rectify &s;ome of his No|tions concerning Epi&s;copacy.
<Q>We make no Doubt,</Q>
&s;ays the Archbi&s;hop to that eminent Prote&s;tant,
<Q>but that the epi&s;copal Degree, which we bear, is an In&s;titution apo&s;tolical and divine; and &s;o always hath been held by a continual Cour&s;e of Times from the Apo&s;tles to this very Age of ours. For as for what you &s;eem to hint out of <HI>Hierom</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI>; as though Cu&s;tom only, and that but latter, prefered Bi&s;hops to Pre&s;byters; it is a Wonder to me, that you &s;hould
<PB N="36" REF="011203_0046_0F94F966875F7F38">
wre&s;t their Sayings to that Purpo&s;e; and that you &s;hould not &s;ee by other of their Books, what they, as well as other Fathers, thought of this. And why you bring in the mention of <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> I do not &s;ufficiently apprehend. For neither what <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> &s;aith of the fir&s;t Pre&s;byter &s;ucceeding the Bi&s;hop decea&s;ing, nor what of the Elders that were wont before tho&s;e Times to be admitted unto the Councils, can by any Pretence look this Way. You may remember, learned Sir, the Be|ginnings of that Epi&s;copacy, which you make to be only of human In&s;titution, are refered by the Fathers, with one Mouth, to the Apo&s;tles, as the Authors thereof; and that the Bi&s;hops were appointed as Succe&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles; e&s;pecially in certain Points of their Functions. And what <HI>Aaron</HI> was to his Sons and to the <HI>Le|vites,</HI> this the Bi&s;hops were to the Prie&s;ts and Deacons; and &s;o e&s;teemed of the Fathers to be by divine In&s;titution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of <HI>Whitgift,</HI> p. 460.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>AMONGST tho&s;e who &s;ignalized them&s;elves in de|fending the Cau&s;e of Epi&s;copacy, was Dr. <HI>Ban|croft,</HI> who &s;ucceeded <HI>Whitgift</HI> in the See of <HI>Can|terbury.</HI> But I need no more than to mention this In&s;tance, &s;ince it is &s;o plain that even the <HI>Centinel</HI> found him&s;elf obliged to contradict the general A&s;|&s;ertion of Mr. <HI>J. Owen</HI> and Dr. <HI>Chauncey,</HI> and to confe&s;s that <HI>Dr. Bancroft in</HI> 1588 <HI>preached up</HI> (by a &s;mall Mi&s;take he &s;ays, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> preached up) <HI>in the Church of England, after the Reformation, that Bi|&s;hops were of divine Right, an Order &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Centinel,</HI> Numb.

after, that <HI>Archbi&s;hop Whitgift &s;aid, he rather wi&s;h|ed, than believed it to be true</HI>; this is incredible in it&s;elf, and &s;eems to re&s;t altogether on <HI>Neal</HI>'s Au|thority. This Hi&s;torian, in his Account of <HI>Ban|croft</HI>'s Sermon, refers to no other Evidence than <HI>Strype</HI>'s Life of <HI>Whitgift</HI>; and in that Book the Ancedote is not to be met with. But near this very Time, <HI>viz.</HI> in 1589, the Archbi&s;hop in An&s;|wer to the Calumnies of <HI>Martin Mar-Prelate,</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>that he was per&s;uaded, that there ought to be by the Word of God, a Superiority, among the Mini&s;ters of the Church; and that it was &s;uffi|ciently proved in his Book again&s;t <HI>Cartwright:</HI> And that he was at all Times ready to ju&s;tify it by the holy Scriptures, and by the Te&s;timony of all Antiquity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of <HI>Whitgift,</HI> p. 304.</NOTE>.</Q>
This clearly &s;hews, in Oppo&s;i|tion to <HI>Neal</HI> and the <HI>Centinel,</HI> that the Archbi&s;hop did not <HI>wi&s;h,</HI> but <HI>believe</HI> Dr. <HI>Bancroft</HI>'s Doctrine to be true.</P>
<P>THE Controver&s;y concerning Epi&s;copacy having been excited and vigorou&s;ly urged again&s;t the Church, by <HI>Cartwright</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociates, it be|came the Object of public Attention. On this Occa&s;ion, the Queen's two great Coun&s;ellors, the Lord Trea&s;urer <HI>Burleigh</HI> and Secretary <HI>Wal&s;ing|ham,</HI> thought fit, in the Year la&s;t mentioned, to have a Conference on the Subject with Dr. <HI>Hutton,</HI> at that Time Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham.</HI> The Bi&s;hop wrote a particular Account of the Conference to the Archbi&s;hop, in a Letter, dated <HI>October</HI> 10th, 1589, which is pre&s;erved in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to <HI>the Life of Whitgift</HI>; and therein it appears that he very earne&s;tly endeavoured to <HI>promote,</HI> with all his Abilities, <HI>the Notion of the Right of Bi&s;hops to govern,</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="011203_0048_0F94F96C19FE3490">

<P>ABOUT this Time Dr. <HI>Bil&s;on,</HI> afterwards Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> wrote his Book, entitled,

<Q>In the A|po&s;tles, I ob&s;erve, &s;ays he, four things needful for the fir&s;t founding and erecting of the Church, tho' not &s;o for the pre&s;erving and maintaining thereof; and four other Points that mu&s;t be per|petual in the Church of Chri&s;t. The four extra|ordinary Privileges of the apo&s;tolic Function were, their <HI>Vocation</HI> immediate from Chri&s;t, not from Men, nor by Men; their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> ex|tending over all the Earth, not limitted to any Place; their <HI>Direction</HI> infallible, the Holy Gho&s;t guiding them, whether they wrote or &s;pake; and their <HI>Operation</HI> wonderful, as well to con|vert and confirm Believers, as to cha&s;ti&s;e and re|venge Di&s;obeyers. Without the&s;e Things the Church could not begin, as is ea&s;ily perceived; but it may well continue without them.&mdash;The other four Points of the apo&s;tolic Delegation, which mu&s;t have their Permanence and Perpetu|ity in the Church of Chri&s;t, are the di&s;pen&s;ing of the Word; admini&s;tring the Sacraments; im|po&s;ing
<PB N="39" REF="011203_0049_0F94F96FCD7FAC58">
of Hands; and guiding the Keys to open or &s;hut the Kingdom of Heaven. The fir&s;t Two, by Rea&s;on they be ordinary Means and In&s;truments by which the Spirit of God worketh each Man's Salvation, mu&s;t be general to all Pa&s;tors and Pre&s;byters of Chri&s;t's Church; the other Two, by which meet Men are called to the Mini&s;try of the word, &amp;c. there is no Cau&s;e they &s;hould be committed to every Pre&s;byter, as the Word and Sacraments are. For as there can be no Order, but Confu&s;ion in a Common-Wealth where every Man ruleth, &s;o would there be no Peace, but a pe&s;tilent Perturbation of all Things in the Church of Chri&s;t, if every Pre&s;byter might impo&s;e Hands, and u&s;e the Keys at his Plea&s;ure.</Q>
Again:
<Q>Who &s;ucceeded the Apo&s;tles, whether all Pre&s;byters equally, or certain chief and cho&s;en Men, one in every Church and City, tru&s;ted with the Government both of the People and Pre&s;byters, I have large|ly debated, and made it plain, as well by the Scriptures as by other ancient Writers pa&s;t all Exception, that from the Apo&s;tles to the fir&s;t <HI>Nicene</HI> Council, and &s;o all along to this our Age, there have always been &s;elected &s;ome of greater Gifts than the Re&s;idue, to &s;ucceed in the Apo&s;|tles Places, to whom it belonged, both to mo|derate the Pre&s;byters of each Church, and to take the &s;pecial Charge of Impo&s;ition of Hands; and this their Singularity in &s;ucceeding, and Su|periority in ordaining, have been ob&s;erved from the Apo&s;tles Times, as the peculiar and &s;ub&s;tan|tial Marks of epi&s;copal Power and Calling.</Q>
I have been the larger in the&s;e Extracts, becau&s;e of the judicious Di&s;tinctions contained in them, as well as on Account of the Scarcene&s;s of that va|luable

Book of which the Authors of the <HI>Biogra|phical Dictionary</HI> gives this Character, that
<Q>it is e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t Books in Favour of Epi&s;copacy.</Q></P>
<P>IN the next Year, viz. 1594, <HI>Hooker</HI> began to publi&s;h his immortal Work, the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Po|lity,</HI> wherein the whole Sy&s;tem of Church-Govern|ment is examined from its fir&s;t Principles, and the Church of <HI>England,</HI> particularly its Hierarchy, is defended with &s;uch Force of Argument and Per|&s;picuity of Method, as are an Honour even to the Age in which he wrote. But this Book is &s;o well known, that I need not be particular. All that I &s;hall &s;ay is, that the Author was &s;o perfectly &s;atisfied of the Goodne&s;s of his Cau&s;e, and the Strength of his Defence, that after he had fini&s;hed it he called upon his Adver&s;aries in the&s;e memo|rable Words:
<Q>We require you to find out but <HI>one</HI> Church upon the Face of the whole Earth, that hath been ordered by your Di&s;cipline, or hath not been ordered by ours, that is to &s;ay, by epi&s;copal Regiment, &s;ince the Time that the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tles were here conver&s;ant.</Q></P>
<P>BY this Time a Number of the able&s;t Pens in the Kingdom were employed in defending the Church, again&s;t the Arguments, and Cavils, and Calum|nies, with which it was fiercely a&s;&s;aulted by its Adver&s;aries. Among&s;t others that engaged in its Defence, was the learned Dr. <HI>Saravia,</HI> formerly a Mini&s;ter of the Dutch reformed Church, and then a Prebendary of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who al&s;o in the &s;ame Year publi&s;hed his Book in an&s;wer to <HI>Beza, de di|ver&s;is Mini&s;trorum in Eccle&s;ia Gradibus</HI>; wherein he more particularly pleads the Cau&s;e of the Engli&s;h

Hierarchy. He dedicates his Book to the Arch|bi&s;hop, and &s;ays in his Dedication,
<Q>that in this Di&s;pute he had defended the epi&s;copal Authority to be of divine In&s;titution, and apo&s;tolical Tra|dition, and that it was taught as well by the Word of God, as by the univer&s;al Con&s;ent of all the Churches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of <HI>Whitgift,</HI> p. 422.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>I MIGHT ea&s;ily proceed to other In&s;tances of the like Nature; but tho&s;e which I have produced are abundantly &s;ufficient for my Purpo&s;e, as every &s;ingle one in this Collection is of it&s;elf, and &s;epa|rately, a full and clear Confutation of Dr. <HI>Chaun|cy</HI>'s po&s;itive and unlimited A&s;&s;ertion, that the Doctrine of Epi&s;copacy, upon the Footing of a <HI>divine Appointment,</HI> was FIRST <HI>promoted in the Church of England by Archbi&s;hop Laud.</HI> For none of the&s;e In&s;tances are later than 1594; and it was not until Ten Years afterwards, in 1604, that <HI>Laud</HI> made his fir&s;t Efforts to <HI>promote</HI> this Doctrine, in his Di&s;putation at the Time of taking his Degree of Bachelor of Divinity<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cyprianus Anglicus, p. 54.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BEFORE I take my Leave of this Subject, it may be proper to remark, that what I have proved to have been the Doctrine of the Bi&s;hops and Clergy in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> mu&s;t have been agreeable to the Queen, and to the principal Per|&s;ons about her Court. <HI>Whitgift,</HI> the Leader in this Controver&s;y, on the Side of the Church, was made Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury&mdash;Bancroft</HI> was &s;oon promoted to the See of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI>&mdash;and <HI>Bil&s;on,</HI> in a &s;hort Time, was advanced to the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI> The&s;e Promotions were doubtle&s;s in|tended,
<PB N="42" REF="011203_0052_0F94F97293703A10">
in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, by the Queen, to re|ward them for their Services in the Defence of the Church, and are manife&s;t Indications that She ap|proved of the Principles for which tho&s;e Writers contended.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;hewn that the Church of <HI>England</HI> was properly <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> from the Beginning of the Re|formation; it is Time to con&s;ider another general A&s;&s;ertion, which is advanced with a View of &s;trengthening the former. <HI>The Point of Re-Ordi|nation,</HI> the Doctor tells us, p. 13, <HI>did not begin to be urged, until the Days of Archbi&s;hop of Laud.</HI> I do not undetrake to contradict him in this Point, but I will endeavour to place it in a proper Light.</P>
<P><HI>UNTIL the Days of Archbi&s;hop Laud,</HI> there were but very few Ca&s;es, if any, wherein it was needful to con&s;ider <HI>the Point of Re-Ordination.</HI> It was not until 1572, that the Puritans ventured to withdraw from the Church, and to &s;et up &s;eparate A&s;&s;emblies; and then, for many Years, their Congregations were &s;upplied with Mini&s;ters who had received Or|dination from the Bi&s;hops in <HI>England.</HI> Afterwards, when this Re&s;ource was in&s;ufficient to an&s;wer their Occa&s;ions, they were at the Trouble and Expence of &s;ending over for Ordination, &s;uch Per&s;ons as were wanted, to <HI>Antwerp</HI> and other Places upon the Continent; &s;till <HI>&s;crupling</HI> to &s;et up an Ordina|tion of their own, in Oppo&s;ition to the Bi&s;hops. As this was the Ca&s;e, there were but few Mini&s;ters in the Kingdom, before the Days of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud,</HI> that had not received epi&s;copal Ordination; and of tho&s;e few, I do not recollect a &s;ingle Per&s;on, that regularly conformed to the Church, and ap|plied for Preferment.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="011203_0053_0F94F97366DA0B80">THE foreign Divines mentioned by the Doctor, <HI>viz. P. Martyr, M. Bucer,</HI> and <HI>P. Fagius,</HI> who were admitted, without Re-Ordination, not to <HI>ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Preferments in the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church,</HI> (ex|cepting <HI>P. Martyr,</HI> who had been <HI>epi&s;copally</HI> or|dained, and was made at la&s;t Canon of Chri&s;t's-Church) but to academical Preferments in the Uni|ver&s;ities; came over upon the Invitation of <HI>Cran|mer,</HI> and were &s;ettled in their re&s;pective Places, be|fore the <HI>Ordinal</HI> was compiled and e&s;tabli&s;hed. As to <HI>Whittingham</HI> and <HI>Travers,</HI> the two other In|&s;tances pointed out by the Doctor; the former was prefered in the early Part of <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, by the Intere&s;t of the Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> the great Pa|tron of the Puritans. Upon the Acce&s;&s;ion of that Prince&s;s, &s;he found the Affairs of Religion in a confu&s;ed, precarious State; and the great Object of her Attention was, fir&s;t, to bring about <HI>quietly,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, the Re-E&s;tabli&s;hment of the prote&s;tant Religion, as it had been reformed in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI>; and then, to &s;ecure it again&s;t the Attempts of the Papi&s;ts. All her political Addre&s;s was requi&s;ite for conducting this important Work, as it was fore&s;een that innumerable Dangers would attend it. In this Condition of Things, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to encourage and employ all Per&s;ons in|di&s;criminately,who were known to be di&s;affected to Popery, and were thought able by writing or preaching to combat &s;ucce&s;sfully its di&s;tingui&s;hing Principles. <HI>Wittingham</HI> was a Per&s;on of this Cha|racter, and although not lawfully ordained, yet by the Connivance of &s;ome, and the Intere&s;t of others, he obtained the Deanry of <HI>Durham. Travers,</HI> a noted Puritan, and a popular Preacher, one of tho&s;e who went over to <HI>Antwerp</HI> for Ordination, finding the Ma&s;ter&s;hip of the Temple vacant, made
<PB N="44" REF="011203_0054_0F94F977478B4E10">
U&s;e of all his Intere&s;t to obtain it; and he &s;uc|ceeded &s;o far, that he engaged even the Lord Trea|&s;urer <HI>Burleigh</HI> to recommend him for the Appoint|ment. But the Archbi&s;hop oppo&s;ed it, alledging his irregular Behaviour, and the In&s;ufficiency of his Ordination. The Event was, that <HI>Travers</HI> was &s;et a&s;ide, and the Place given to his Competitor, the celebrated <HI>Hooker.</HI> His Friends however made a Shift to keep him in as the Preacher of the Af|ternoon Lecture.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;hewn in what Manner <HI>Whittingham</HI> and <HI>Travers</HI> got their Preferments, I &s;hall go on to ob&s;erve, that there were in the former Part of this Reign many In&s;tances of <HI>meer Laymen,</HI> without any <HI>Kind</HI> of Ordination, who had the Addre&s;s to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of Livings in the Church.
<Q><HI>Ni|cholas,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bangor,</HI></Q>
&s;ays one who was mo&s;t circum&s;tantially acquainted with the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Times,
<Q>having this Year (1567) made &s;ome In&s;pection into the Condition of his Dioce&s;s, &s;ent the Archbi&s;hop, according to his Order, the Names of all the Dean and Chapter, and of all the Mini&s;ters in his Dioce&s;s, with Account of their Re&s;idency and their Ho&s;pitality; &s;uch al&s;o as were not Deacons, nor Prie&s;ts; and yet held ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Preferments. To the End, as he wrote, that his Grace might perceive, how Men that were no Mini&s;ters had &s;uch Livings, to the utter Decay of learned Men to be Mini&s;ters, where others had that Liberty to hold Benefices, and not to be in Orders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of <HI>Parker,</HI> p. 256.</NOTE>.</Q>
If then the Prefer|ments of &s;uch Men as <HI>Whittingham</HI> and <HI>Travers</HI> are a Proof, that in this Reign the Ordination of Pre&s;byters was allowed to be valid; tho&s;e Prefer|ments
<PB N="45" REF="011203_0055_0F94F9777054AE40">
which were held by the Laity are al&s;o a Proof, that no Ordination at all was thought to be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>BUT neither of the&s;e Conclu&s;ions ought to be admitted; &s;ince we know upon the &s;tronge&s;t Evi|dence, that it was the Doctrine of the Church throughout the whole of the Reign we are con&s;i|dering, that Ordination was of divine Appoint|ment, and that epi&s;copal Ordination was of apo&s;to|lical In&s;titution; and that it was an e&s;tabli&s;hed Law from the very Beginning of it, that
<Q>no Man &s;hould be accounted or taken to be a lawful Bi|&s;hop, Prie&s;t or Deacon in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or &s;uffered to execute any of the &s;aid Functions,</Q>
without epi&s;copal Ordination. Yet notwith&s;tanding, it was impo&s;&s;ible to prevent Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of it in &s;ome In&s;tances; and &s;uch In&s;tances &s;hew, not what was approved of, but what was overlooked or per|mitted, through the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Times. The&s;e Irregularities however were corrected by Degrees, and in a Cour&s;e of Years they were entirely remov|ed. In 1586, the Archbi&s;hop took Cognizance of the Ca&s;e of <HI>Travers,</HI> objecting to
<Q>his Ordination at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and his denying to receive the Or|ders of the Mini&s;try according to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Book of Ordination.</Q>
<HI>Travers</HI> drew up the Rea|&s;ons for his Conduct, and pre&s;ented them to the Lord Trea&s;urer, who &s;ent them to the Archbi&s;hop. The Archbi&s;hop returned them with &s;hort margi|nal Animadver&s;ions, &s;ome of which I will tran|&s;cribe, for the U&s;e of Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> and his Friends.
<Q>As to that A&s;&s;ertion, that Mini&s;ters lawfully made in any Church of &s;ound Profe&s;&s;ion in the Faith, were acknowledged &s;uch in any other; and this to be the univer&s;al and perpetual Prac|tice;
<PB N="46" REF="011203_0056_0F94F977D640E640">
the Archbi&s;hop made this only Exception; <HI>always excepting &s;uch Churches as allowed of Pre&s;|bytery and executed it.</HI> Then as to his Examples, this was the Archbi&s;hop's Animadver&s;ion&mdash;that he knew no &s;uch foreign Mini&s;ters executing their Mini&s;try here; but if there were, their Cau&s;e was far differing from his&mdash;That Mr. <HI>Whitting|ham,</HI> had he lived, had been deprived, without &s;pecial Grace and Di&s;pen&s;ation; although his Cau&s;e and Mr. <HI>Travers</HI>'s were nothing like.&mdash; That the Laws of this Realm required, that &s;uch as were to be allowed as Mini&s;ters in this Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould be ordained by a Bi&s;hop, and &s;ub&s;cribe to the Articles before him. La&s;tly, whereas <HI>Travers</HI> had &s;aid, that the la&s;t Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> was acquainted with his Manner of calling to the Mini&s;try; and &s;o was the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and were contented he &s;hould preach at the Temple (as he had done now almo&s;t &s;ix Years) and that the pre&s;ent Arch|bi&s;hop him&s;elf had not taken any Exceptions a|gain&s;t it; our Archbi&s;hop &s;aid, that this was to abu&s;e their Patience, and that he never allowed of his Kind of calling, neither could he allow of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of <HI>Whitgift,</HI> p. 252.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>AS to <HI>the three Pre&s;byters that were con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hops for Scotland</HI> in the following Reign; they were not con&s;ecrated immediately, without previ|ous Ordinations, on the Principle that Ordination by Pre&s;byters was valid, but upon the Belief that the epi&s;copal Character, as it included tho&s;e of a Pre&s;byter and a Deacon, might be conveyed by a &s;ingle Con&s;ecration, as in the In&s;tances of St.

<P>BY this Time, I tru&s;t, it may fairly be judged, whether the Want of In&s;tances of Re-Ordination before the Days of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud,</HI> can in the lea&s;t affect the Evidence I have produced,
<Q>that the Church of <HI>England</HI> is epi&s;copal.</Q></P>
<P>I MUST now return back to p. 10, to examine the Doctor's other <HI>capital</HI> A&s;&s;ertion. <HI>It is in Fact true,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that both in King Henry the Eighth's Time, and in Edward the Sixth's, the Bi&s;hops took out Commi&s;&s;ions from the Crown like other</HI> STATE-OFFICERS, <HI>for the exerci&s;ing their &s;piritual Juri&s;|diction; in which they acknowledge, that</HI> ALL SORTS <HI>of Juri&s;diction, eccle&s;ia&s;tical as well as civil, flow</HI> ORIGINALLY <HI>from the regal Power, as from a</HI> SU|PREME HEAD.&mdash;<HI>Among the Particulars of eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Power given them by this Commi&s;&s;ion, is that of</HI> ORDAINING <HI>Pre&s;byters.</HI> Now what the Doctor means by this and more to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, may be gathered from p. 57, where he affirms, without Ambiguity, that <HI>as to Authority purely Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, there is no &s;uch Thing in the Church of England.</HI> And he intimates p. 11, that &s;uch Authority was never claimed by the Church, <HI>until the</HI> afore&s;aid
<PB N="48" REF="011203_0058_0F94F979EF598560">
<HI>Days of Archbi&s;hop Laud</HI>; telling us, again from the <HI>Irenicum,</HI> that <HI>if we come lower to the Time of King James, his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf declared</HI> IN PRINT <HI>as his Judgment,</HI>
<Q>that the civil Power, in any Nation, hath the Right of pre&s;cribing what ex|ternal Form of Church-Government it plea&s;es, which doth mo&s;t agree to the civil Form of Go|vernment in the State.</Q>
And thus the Religion of the Church of <HI>England</HI> is made to be altogether a PARLIAMENTARY RELIGION.</P>
<P>THIS Gentleman mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed not to be ignorant to whom he is indebted for the Weapons of his literary Warfare; but it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve to others, that this general Charge again&s;t our Reformers was fir&s;t drawn up by <HI>Bellarmine, Saunders, Doleman, Harding,</HI> and other Papi&s;ts, in Revenge for their rejecting the Pope's Supremacy; and that the Enemies of <HI>revealed Religion</HI> have all along endeavoured to &s;upport them in the Charge.</P>
<P>THE Point has been &s;trenuou&s;ly laboured by <HI>Tin|dal,</HI> the mo&s;t inveterate of the <HI>dei&s;tical</HI> Tribe; and &s;ome of our late Adver&s;aries have not been a&s;hamed to follow him as their Leader. Even the good Doctor him&s;elf has honoured his Book of <HI>the Rights,</HI> with a &s;econd-hand Quotation. Now, that the&s;e two Bands, the Papi&s;ts and Dei&s;ts, &s;hould be re-inforced by &s;ome of the hot-headed extrava|gant Writers on the Side of the Di&s;&s;enters, is not to be wondered at; but that a Man of the Doctor's Coolne&s;s and Prudence &s;hould be &s;een to
<Q>go down</Q>
to the&s;e
<Q>Phili&s;tines to &s;harpen <HI>his</HI> Mat|tock,</Q>
is a little &s;urprizing. But without pur|&s;uing &s;o obvious a Reflection, I will proceed im|mediately to the Doctrine of the King's Supremacy, as maintained in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and in|quire

whether it is fairly repre&s;ented in the above-quoted Pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>I HAVE already proved that the Church of <HI>En|gland</HI> has con&s;tantly a&s;&s;erted an <HI>Authority purely Eccle&s;ia&s;tical,</HI> derived from Chri&s;t as its proper Source and Author; and con&s;equently not from the Crown, or the civil Con&s;titution. Thus, for In&s;tance, the Power of Ordination, and Authority to admini&s;ter the Word and Sacraments, have al|ways been exerci&s;ed upon the Footing of a <HI>divine Appointment.</HI> The Church al&s;o claims a farther
<Q>Power to decree Rites and Ceremonies, and Au|thority in Controver&s;ies of Faith,</Q>
as belonging to her by Virtue of this Appointment; which Claim has been acknowledged and &s;upported, by all our Kings and Queens &s;ince the Reformation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Authority and Authenticity of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Clau&s;e of <HI>Art.</HI> XX, clearly proved and defended in <HI>A Vindication of the Church of England,</HI> &amp;c. in An&s;wer to <HI>Prie&s;tcraft in Per|fection.</HI> See al&s;o <HI>Bennet's Hi&s;tory of the Articles,</HI> and <HI>Collier's Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory.</HI></NOTE>. Unle&s;s therefore the Church is incon&s;i&s;tent with her&s;elf, and believes an Authority to be derived from Chri&s;t, which She believes <HI>not</HI> to be derived from him, but from another Fountain; She can|not hold that the regal Power and Supremacy ex|tend to Matters of this Nature, any farther than to controul and regulate the external Exerci&s;e of &s;uch &s;piritual Authority.</P>
<P>IN what Sen&s;e &s;he maintains the Doctrine of the King's Supremacy, is expre&s;&s;ed with great Clear|ne&s;s and Preci&s;ion in her 37th Article.
<Q>The Queen's Maje&s;ty hath the chief Power in this Realm of <HI>England,</HI> and other her Dominions,
<PB N="50" REF="011203_0060_0F94F97B102AAFE8">
unto whom the chief Government of all E&s;tates of this Realm, whether they be eccle&s;ia&s;tical or civil, in all Cau&s;es doth appertain, and is not, nor ought to be &s;ubject to any foreign Juri&s;dicti|on. Whereas we attribute to the Queen's Ma|je&s;ty the chief Government, by which Titles we under&s;tand the Minds of &s;ome <HI>&s;landerous</HI> Folks to be offended; we give not to our Princes the mi|ni&s;tring of God's Word, or of the Sacraments, the which Thing the Injunctions al&s;o lately &s;et forth by <HI>Elizabeth</HI> our Queen do mo&s;t plainly te&s;tify: But that only Prerogative which we &s;ee to have been given always to all godly Princes in holy Scripture by God him&s;elf, that is, that they &s;hould rule all E&s;tates and Degrees committed to their Charge by God, whether they be Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical or Temporal, and re&s;train with the civil Sword the &s;tubborn and evil Doers.</Q>
More Power than this, we give not to our Princes; and le&s;s, I believe, is not claimed by the &s;upreme civil Governors of any Kingdom or Republic upon Earth. In the INJUNCTIONS to which the Article refers, the Queen &s;ays:
<Q>Her Maje&s;ty neither doth, nor ever will challenge any Autho|rity, other than that was challenged and lately u&s;ed by the &s;aid noble Kings of famous Memo|ry, King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, and King <HI>Edward</HI> VI, which is and was of ancient Time due to the imperial Crown of this Realm: That is, under God to have the Sovereignty and Rule over all Manner of Per&s;ons born within the&s;e her Realms, Dominions and Countries, of what E&s;tate, either Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or Temporal, &s;oever they be; &s;o as no other foreign Power &s;hall or ought to have any Superiority over them.</Q></P>

<P><PB N="52" REF="011203_0062_0F94F98097E64D28">IF we examine our 37th Article, it is evident that the main De&s;ign of it is to guard again&s;t the Juri&s;diction of the Pope, and to &s;ecure to our Princes that Supremacy in eccle&s;ia&s;tical Matters, which the reformed <HI>German</HI> Princes and States had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully exerted, and which, by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, is one of the mo&s;t ancient and un|doubted Rights of the Crown. At the &s;ame Time it is farther evident, both from the <HI>Article</HI> and the Queen's <HI>Injunctions,</HI> that the Church was believed to have certain Powers of a &s;piritual Nature, which this Supremacy does not include, and which our Princes are &s;o far from pretending to convey, that all Manner of Right to exerci&s;e them in their own Per&s;ons is therein formally and expre&s;sly di&s;|claimed. If Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had believed that all eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority flow'd from the Crown, contrary to her own &s;olemn Declarations; there was a Time wherein She could have hardly avoided to betray the&s;e Sentiments: I mean, after the Depriva|tion of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops, when &s;he undertook to &s;upply the vacant Sees with Men of other Prin|ciples. It was with great Difficulty that She was able to procure proper Per&s;ons to perform the fir&s;t Con&s;ecration; and had She been of Opinion that She had the Power in her&s;elf, it is more than pro|bable, that, in tho&s;e Circum&s;tances&punc; She would have immediately and directly inve&s;ted Dr. <HI>Parker</HI> with the archiepi&s;copal Office.

<Q>That &s;ince all Juri&s;diction both eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil flowed from the King as &s;upreme Head, and he was the Foundation of all Power; it be|came tho&s;e who exerci&s;ed it only at the King's Courte&s;y, gratefully to acknowledge, that they had it only of his Bounty; and to declare that they would deliver it up again, when it &s;hould plea&s;e him to call for it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

This, I believe, mu&s;t be the Commi&s;&s;ion which the Doctor alludes to. He is plea&s;ed to &s;ay that the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> (in the Plural) took out &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion, and affirms that <HI>it is in Fact true</HI>; but Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet,</HI> after all his Exa|mination, &s;ays,
<Q>whether the other Bi&s;hops took out &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion from this King, I find not.</Q>
The Language of this Commi&s;&s;ion, as has been acknowledged, appears to be exceptiona|ble; but its Meaning may notwith&s;tanding be harm|le&s;s. What was intended by it mu&s;t be learnt from the public Declarations of tho&s;e Times relating to the Subject.

It is therefore evident, that what was meant to be given by the King, in his Com|mi&s;&s;ion to the Bi&s;hops, was no more than a Liberty, a <HI>legal</HI> Authority, to exerci&s;e their &s;piritual Functi|ons; and a Juri&s;diction, relating to Matters te&s;ta|mentary, matrimonial, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is called &s;piri|tual, becau&s;e it is committed to &s;piritual Per&s;ons. And &s;uch Juri&s;diction as this, undoubtedly flows from the Crown, and it becomes tho&s;e who are in|tru&s;ted with it, to acknowledge that they hold it of the King's Bounty, and to deliver it up when he calls for it, if they have received it on that Condi|tion. For an Illu&s;tration of this Matter, let it be con&s;idered, that every Man is, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, a King in his own Hou&s;e and Family; and no Cler|gyman has a Right to come into it to perform any eccle&s;ia&s;tical Offices, to admini&s;ter Bapti&s;m for In|&s;tance, without his Leave and Con&s;ent. Upon him it altogether depends, whether the Clergyman &s;hall have a proper and <HI>lawful</HI> Authority to perform this Office in his Family. But is it not evident, that the giving him that Authority, is a very different Thing from inve&s;ting him with the general Power to admini&s;ter the Sacraments? In like Manner, as a Kingdom may be con&s;idered as a large Family, the King is the political Father of this Family, and as &s;uch is &s;upreme over all Per&s;ons belonging to it, whether &s;piritual or temporal. And without his Con&s;ent or Authority, no Bi&s;hop or eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;on can lawfully officiate within his Dominions. But the giving this Authority by Commi&s;&s;ion, or in any other Way, does not convey to any Man his &s;acred Character, but always &s;uppo&s;es him to have
<PB N="56" REF="011203_0066_0F94F986EDBA2958">
been previou&s;ly inve&s;ted with it, by Virtue of a Commi&s;&s;ion from CHRIST.</P>
<P>THE above Explanation of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power claimed by <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, as belonging to the regal Supremacy, the Words will fairly admit of; and in this Sen&s;e they are ea&s;ily reconciled with other Declarations that were made, about the &s;ame Time, in Acts of Parliament, and in public In&s;tru|ments of different Kinds. Nay, the above Expla|nation is nece&s;&s;ary, in Order to make this very Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Bonner</HI> con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf. For be&s;ides the Juri&s;diction conveyed by it, from the Crown, it acknowledges another Sort of Power to have been committed to him by <HI>divine Authority,</HI> and that this was evident from <HI>Holy Scripture.</HI> The Words are: <HI>Praeter et ultra ea quae tibi ex &s;acris Literis</HI> DIVINITUS <HI>commi&s;&s;a e&s;&s;e digno&s;cuntur.</HI> In the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> VI, from 1548 to 1553, Bi&s;hops were commonly con&s;tituted by the King's <HI>Letters Patent.</HI>

<P><PB N="57" REF="011203_0067_0F94F987940E3760">BUT notwith&s;tanding, Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> has thought fit to &s;ay, that <HI>among the Particulars of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power given them by this Commi&s;&s;ion, is that of or|daining Pre&s;byters.</HI> Now this A&s;&s;ertion he borrows from the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Gentleman,</HI> and the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Gentleman</HI> borrows it from <HI>Tindal,</HI> Author of <HI>the Rights</HI>; and <HI>Tindal,</HI> producing no explicit Form of Words whereby this Power was ever conveyed from the Crown, only <HI>infers</HI> it from the Language of the King's Commi&s;&s;ion, which has been con&s;i|dered already. The Words of <HI>Tindal</HI> are the&s;e:
<Q>The Juri&s;diction any Bi&s;hop has, and his Right to have a Share in the making of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Canons, and the Power of <HI>con&s;tituting inferior Mini&s;ters,</HI> mu&s;t be derived mediately from the Parliament, but immediately from the King, as having the &s;upreme executive Power</Q>.
The Reader here &s;ees, that what <HI>Tindal,</HI> by way of In|ference, had made to be <HI>a Power of con&s;tituting inferior Mini&s;ters,</HI> the Doctor by a farther Infer|ence from his Inference, makes to be <HI>a Power of ordaining Pre&s;byters</HI>; and thus his Propo&s;ition is e&s;tabli&s;hed. It would have been much more to the Purpo&s;e, if he, or the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Gentleman,</HI> or the Author of <HI>the Rights,</HI> had pointed out to us a &s;ingle In&s;tance of a Pre&s;byter ordained by Virtue of the King's Commi&s;&s;ion <HI>only,</HI> by Per&s;ons who had no other Kind of Authority. For if the Commi&s;&s;ion was given for that Purpo&s;e, it is &s;trange that it &s;hould not have produced the intended Effect in one In&s;tance; and if there were any In&s;tances of it, it is &s;trange that the Saga|city of &s;uch Writers &s;hould not be able to di&s;cover them.</P>
<P>I HAVE now &s;hewn from our Articles, and the public Declarations of &s;uch of our Princes as were more immediately concerned in bringing about the Reformation, that the Supremacy claimed by our

Kings, and given to them by the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> does by no Means exclude a purely &s;piritual Authority&mdash;an Authority which is derived only from Chri&s;t&mdash;which has di&s;tinct Acts and Offices of its own&mdash;and which is incommunicable by the civil Magi&s;trate. This Account might be confirmed by Te&s;timonies from a continued Succe&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t and be&s;t Writers, which our Nation has ever afforded. I might al&s;o produce the Declara|tions of our &s;ucceeding Princes, down to our own Times; but a full Treati&s;e upon the Subject is not my Intention, and I fear the Reader has already been too long detained with it. And yet I mu&s;t beg Leave to exhibit the Te&s;timony of James I&s;t, &s;ince the Doctor, from the <HI>Irenicum,</HI> has introdu|ced him as &s;peaking the Language, which &s;eems to favour his Side of the Que&s;tion now in Debate.

<P>SHOULD it now be a&s;ked, what is all this to the Purpo&s;e of an American Epi&s;copate? My An&s;wer is, I know not, but&mdash;perhaps Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> does. Should it be a&s;ked again, is it any Defence of the <HI>Appeal?</HI> To this I mu&s;t an&s;wer, I can hardly con|ceive that it is. I &s;aid nothing obout the Opinion of our Reformers, upon the Points of Epi&s;copacy and the King's Supremacy; and therefore my Vindication of them, can properly be no Vindication
<PB N="59" REF="011203_0069_0F94F98912BEF340">
of any Thing I had advanced. It is however in|tended to vindicate the Engli&s;h Reformation, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> from the Charge of <HI>Era&s;tia|ni&s;m</HI>; which the late Attacks, occa&s;ioned by the <HI>Appeal,</HI> have made nece&s;&s;ary in it&s;elf, and a Duty peculiarly incumbent upon me. But although what has been &s;aid, is not properly a Defence of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> yet it is in &s;ome Degree nece&s;&s;ary in Order to prepare the Way for defending it, again&s;t &s;uch a Kind of Oppo&s;ition as has been made to it.</P>
<P>THE Way being thus prepared, I &s;hall now pro|ceed to an immediate Defence of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> &s;o far as I find it ought to be defended; but with a Mind open to Conviction, and with a Re&s;olution to re|tract, if, upon this Re-examination of the Subject, I &s;hall find, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of my Opponents, or by any other Means, that I had fallen into any Mi&s;takes of Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>I BEGAN with ob&s;erving, that
<Q>it is an e&s;&s;ential Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that none have Authority in the Chri&s;tian Church, but tho&s;e who derive it from Chri&s;t, either <HI>mediately</HI> or <HI>immediately.</HI></Q>
To which the Doctor replies: <HI>This is not a Doctrine peculiar to the Engli&s;h Church. Every other Chri&s;tian Church, of whatever Denomi|nation, holds the &s;ame. The Churches in the Colonies, are certainly of this Opinion.</HI> So far then, it &s;eems, we agree; but then he cannot think that an <HI>uninter|rupted Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to a <HI>mediate</HI> Conveyance of this Authority; &s;o that while he owns the Prin|ciple, he rejects its unavoidable and in&s;eparable Con&s;equence. For when a Thing is to be conveyed from one Per&s;on to another, not immediately, but by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Communication through a Number of intermediate Hands; if any one in the Succe&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="60" REF="011203_0070_0F94F989DC55BD08">
fails of making the Conveyance, the Thing evidently &s;tops, and pa&s;&s;es not on to the Per&s;on for whom it is intended. Thus for Example; &s;hould any Thing be &s;ent from <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> and yet be carried no farther than to <HI>Canterbury</HI> or <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and peri&s;h there, it could never arrive at the Place of its De&s;tination. Again: Should I claim a Ti|tle to any ancient E&s;tate, and it &s;hould appear, upon Inquiry, that the Chain of Conveyances has been broken before it reached me; my Title will be pronounced to be invalid. Nothing but this uninterrupted Chain of Conveyances is wanting, to intitle me to the be&s;t E&s;tate in the Kingdom. Once more: If a Man is to receive a Commi&s;&s;ion medi|ately from the King; unle&s;s the Per&s;on who confers it has been authorized to do &s;o, it is evidently not the King's Commi&s;&s;ion that he receives, but one that is &s;purious. The&s;e Ca&s;es are plain, and will hardly be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>LET us &s;ee then, whether an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion is not as nece&s;&s;ary to a mediate Con|veyance of Authority from Chri&s;t, as from the King or any other Per&s;on. If Authority can be conveyed from Chri&s;t mediately, by a Succe&s;&s;ion that is interrupted, there mu&s;t be &s;omewhere in the Succe&s;&s;ion a Per&s;on who can give that which he has not. If the Authority fir&s;t given to A, is to pa&s;s on &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to B, to C, to D, and to E; &s;hould the Conveyance &s;top or be interrupted at C, &s;o that it pa&s;&s;es not on to D; in that Ca&s;e D does not re|ceive it, and therefore cannot convey it to E, un|le&s;s D is able to give what it has not. Suppo&s;ing the Authority, when it comes down to C, to be anni|hilated or to cea&s;e; unle&s;s it be renewed, E can never be inve&s;ted with it. The Que&s;tion then is,
<PB N="61" REF="011203_0071_0F94F98A8C55D258">
who &s;hall renew it? Now all Authority from Chri&s;t, mu&s;t flow from Chri&s;t; if it begins, and has its Source &s;hort of him, it is not HIS Authority. If he plea&s;es to renew it, he may give it immediately to E, or he may give it to D, by him to be commu|nicated to E; and in either Way E may be inve&s;ted with Chri&s;t's Authority. But now let us &s;uppo&s;e that any Number of 'Men upon Earth,' or that
<Q>all the Angels in Heaven</Q>
&s;hould attempt to renew the Authority of Chri&s;t, once interrupted and lo&s;t; unle&s;s a Stream can have a higher Derivation than its Source&mdash;unle&s;s the&s;e Men or the&s;e Angels can give what they have not, the Thing is impo&s;&s;ible. They may give what they have&mdash;they may give their own Authority; but Chri&s;t's Authority they cannot give, unle&s;s they have received it. And if they have received it, it is not they that renew the Authority, but Chri&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE Doctor cries out, <HI>is this the Doctrine of the Church of England?</HI> Whether it be &s;o or not, he in Effect tells us that <HI>every other Chri&s;tian Church, of whatever Denomination, holds</HI> it &mdash; that <HI>the Churches in the Colonies, are certainly of this Opi|nion; i. e.</HI> they believe a <HI>mediate</HI> Conveyance of Authority from Chri&s;t, which nece&s;&s;arily implies an unbroken Succe&s;&s;ion of Conveyers. He appears therefore to have acted incon&s;i&s;tently, in treating the general Doctrine of a mediate Conveyance, or, in other Words, an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion, as if it were &s;ingular, un&s;criptural, ab&s;urd and con|temptible. He may &s;ay that he meant to explode &s;uch a Succe&s;&s;ion <HI>in the Line of Bi&s;hops</HI> only; but this is not clearly expre&s;&s;ed. His Words, in &s;ome Places lead us to believe, and the Arguments of &s;ome of our Adver&s;aries force us to conclude, that the
<PB N="62" REF="011203_0072_0F94F98B4E95DF18">
Doctrine of an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion in general, without any Limitation, is con&s;idered by them as ab&s;urd and ridiculous. Whether in particular the Conveyance of Chri&s;t's Authority, from the Apo|&s;tles down to the pre&s;ent Day, has been made only in the Line of Bi&s;hops, is a different Que&s;tion; and which Way &s;oever it may be decided, it affects not the common Principle of an uninterrupted Suc|ce&s;&s;ion. And whether it has been made in the Line of Bi&s;hops, depends upon the Deci&s;ion of another Que&s;tion, which is, whether the Power of Ordi|nation was originally given to Bi&s;hops only, as an Order &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters. That the Affirmative of this Que&s;tion is maintained by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> I have abundantly proved.</P>
<P>THE Doctor in p. 15, &s;ays of the Succe&s;&s;ion for which we contend, that <HI>it is not capable of any good Proof, nor is there any Probability, that &s;o long a Chain, runing through &s;o many Ages of Ignorance, Violence, and all Kinds of Impo&s;ture, has never once been broke.</HI> But this A&s;&s;ertion militates as forcibly again&s;t the Succe&s;&s;ion which <HI>the Churches in the Co|lonies certainly</HI> believe, as again&s;t the Epi&s;copal. As to the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Line of Bi&s;hops, I am &s;till of Opinion, that
<Q>it is incumbent on the Ob|jectors to prove that it has been interrupted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of our weekly Adver&s;aries &s;ays, that
<Q>in the De|bate between Dr. <HI>Hoadly,</HI> then Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bangor,</HI> and the <HI>Nonjurors,</HI> the Dr. with great Succe&s;s, refuted this Whim, <HI>viz.</HI> of the uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops.</Q>
(<HI>Cent.</HI> Numb. XII.) I am &s;o far from being of this Writer's Opini|on, that it appears to me, that Bi&s;hop <HI>Hoadly</HI>'s Notions relat|ing to this Subject were confuted, by &s;ome of his Antagoni&s;ts, even to a Demon&s;tration. Tho&s;e who attacked the Bi&s;hop, in what is called the <HI>Bangorian</HI> Controver&s;y, are here indefinite|ly &s;poken of as <HI>Nonjurers</HI>; whereas they were, in general, as well affected to the Government, and gave as good Proofs of it, as any Men in the Kingdom; and I can recollect no more than one Nonjuror that appeared in the Controver&s;y. What does the <HI>Centinel</HI> think of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Potter,</HI> of the Bi&s;hops <HI>Hare</HI> and <HI>Sherlock,</HI> and of the Doctors <HI>Snape, Rogers</HI> and <HI>Stebbing,</HI> who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves on the Occa&s;ion; to &s;ay nothing of the Body of the national Clergy repre&s;ented in Convoca|tion, who, by their very learned Committee, complained of Bi&s;hop <HI>Hoadly,</HI> among other Things, for
<Q>the Contempt thrown <HI>by him</HI> upon a regular Succe&s;&s;ion of the Mini&s;try, and of the epi&s;copal Order in particular?</Q>
Were the&s;e all Nonjurors and Jacobites? Such Nonjurors and Jacobites are the American Clergy; among whom I know not one, who is not firmly attached to his Maje&s;ty King GEORGE'S Per&s;on, Family and Government, or who, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome &s;ly Hints to the contrary, looks upon him&s;elf to have any more Concern with the De&s;cendants of <HI>James</HI> II, if there be any, than with the De&s;cendants of <HI>Harold</HI> or <HI>Edgar Atheling.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>

For we know, by the be&s;t hi&s;torical Evidence, that it has been the univer&s;al Practice of the Church, from the Time of the Apo&s;tles to the pre&s;ent Hour, to acknowledge none for Bi&s;hops, who were not ordained by other Bi&s;hops. We know, from the very Nature of the Office, as well as from Hi&s;tory, that the Con&s;ecration of Bi&s;hops was always a pub|lic &s;olemn Act, of which there were many Wit|ne&s;&s;es&mdash;that every &s;uch Con&s;ecration was e&s;teemed to be a Matter of &s;uch Importance, that the Re|port of it was immediately propagated and carried even to di&s;tant Places&mdash;and that, in di&s;puted Ca&s;es, it was ea&s;y to di&s;cover, whether the Per&s;on was, in Reality, a Bi&s;hop or not; or, &s;uppo&s;ing the con|trary, that no one would receive epi&s;copal Con&s;e|cration from &s;uch Hands. We know al&s;o from Scripture, that if &s;uch a Succe&s;&s;ion is as nece&s;&s;ary, as, upon a &s;peculative Examination, it appears to be, Chri&s;t has promi&s;ed to pre&s;erve and continue it "to the End of the World." With the&s;e vari|ous

Kinds of Evidence we are abundantly &s;atisfied; and until the Objectors are able to bring <HI>po&s;itive Proofs</HI> that the Succe&s;&s;ion has been interrupted, we &s;hall not recede from the Claim.</P>
<P>THE only Proof of this Nature attempted by the Doctor is in a Note, where he gives this In|formation: <HI>Mr. Petoy the Hi&s;torian, &s;ays, that the Church of England, as well as the Scotch Church, was at fir&s;t planted and governed, without Bi&s;hops until Bi&s;hops were &s;ent from Rome.

<Q>The ancient <HI>Britons</HI> are believed to have had at lea&s;t one <HI>Archiepi&s;copal</HI> See before the Times of <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> the <HI>Monk, viz.</HI> at <HI>Caerleon,</HI> or (as &s;ome will have it) at <HI>Landaff</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Law, Tit. BISHOPS.</NOTE>.</Q>
And Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> to whom more Attention may be paid by &s;ome People for the Sake of his <HI>Irenicum,</HI> having carefully &s;tudied <HI>the Antiquities of the Bri|ti&s;h Churches,</HI> in his large Work on that Subject, &s;ays in p. 77.
<Q>I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to que&s;tion a Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops here from the fir&s;t founding of a Chri&s;tian Church.&mdash;Although, by the Lo&s;s of Records of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Churches, we cannot draw down the Succe&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops from the Apo&s;tles Time, yet we have great Rea&s;on to pre&s;ume &s;uch a Succe&s;&s;ion, when upon the fir&s;t &s;ummoning a Council by <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> three <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops appeared; one out of every Pro|vince; as they did in other Parts.</Q>
Again, to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e in p. 83.
<Q>Although we cannot deduce a lineal Succe&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops, as they could in other Churches, where Writings were
<PB N="65" REF="011203_0075_0F94F9A9841808E0">
pre&s;erved, yet as &s;oon as through the Church's Peace they came to have Intercour&s;e with foreign Churches (as in the Council of <HI>Arles</HI>) they ap|peared with a proportionable Number of Bi&s;hops with tho&s;e of other Provinces; and their Suc|ce&s;&s;ion was not in the lea&s;t di&s;puted among them, they &s;ub&s;cribing to the Sentence and Canons as others did.</Q>
But after all, &s;uppo&s;ing the Ca&s;e to have been as is repre&s;ented by Mr. <HI>Petoy</HI>; it affects not the Authority of our pre&s;ent Bi&s;hops. If they derive their Succe&s;&s;ion from the Bi&s;hops that were &s;ent over in the &s;ixth Century, their not having received it from Bi&s;hops of the old <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Churches is no better Proof of its Invalidity, than their not having received it from the ancient <HI>Druids.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER Objection is made to the uninterrupt|ed Succe&s;&s;ion claimed for our Bi&s;hops, on Account of its <HI>expo&s;ing the Church and Religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to open Ridicule,</HI> p. 16. Now I am unable to con|ceive that the general Doctrine can appear ridicu|lous to any that under&s;tand it; but &s;hould it be o|therwi&s;e, I cannot help it. To &s;ome Per&s;ons, many other Doctrines of the Chri&s;tian Religion appear to be ridiculous; but will this be thought a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for Chri&s;tians to explode them? Will the Doctor be willing to regulate the Sy&s;tem of his own Belief, by this Standard? Do <HI>the Churches in the Colonies</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h Ridicule for the Te&s;t of Truth? That the Church of <HI>England</HI> does not, I am very certain. But &s;till, that the Doctrine of an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion in the Line of Bi&s;hops &s;hould be more ridiculous, than of &s;uch a Succe&s;|&s;ion in the Line of Pre&s;byters, is to me utterly in|comprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="011203_0076_0F94F9AD22C3A880">I COME now to con&s;ider the great popular Ob|jection, that this Doctrine unchurches all the fo|reign Prote&s;tants who are without epi&s;copal Govern|ment, as well as the Pre&s;byterians in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and our own Di&s;&s;enters; on which Account the Doctor &s;ays of it, that <HI>in&s;tead of de&s;erving a &s;erious Con|futation, it may rea&s;onably excite the Contempt of all.</HI> I &s;u&s;pect he found it much ea&s;ier to treat it with Contempt, than to give it a &s;erious Confutation; and yet as it &s;tood &s;o much in his Way, it might have been well worth his while to have removed it, if he could, although at the Expence of a <HI>&s;erious Confutation.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I an&s;wer directly to the Objection, I beg Leave to remind him of Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI>'s Po&s;ition, that
<Q>the ill Con&s;equences drawn from Opinions are not to be charged on all that hold them, unle&s;s they do likewi&s;e own tho&s;e Con&s;equences.</Q>
Now, if it be a Con&s;equence of the Doctrine of an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion in the Line of Bi&s;hops, that many of the foreign Prote&s;tants are unchurch|ed; yet it is a Con&s;equence that has &s;eldom been owned by the Advocates for the Doctrine. Is it then candid in the Doctor to charge us with this Con&s;equence? Would he be willing to be treated in this Manner him&s;elf? He is generally <HI>thought</HI> to be calvini&s;tic in his Principles, and to hold the Doctrines of Election and Reprobation in the Sen&s;e of the <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI>'s Catechi&s;m. Now he need not be informed, that there are many Per&s;ons who believe, the unavoidable Con&s;equences of tho&s;e Doctrines to be, that <HI>Man is no moral Agent,</HI> and of Cour&s;e <HI>no accountable Creature</HI>&mdash;that <HI>the Supreme Being is the Author of all Sin,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e Con&s;equences, I dare &s;ay, he di&s;owns, and looks upon the Imputation of
<PB N="67" REF="011203_0077_0F94F9AF1A0919A0">
them as injurious. Why then will he impute to us a Con&s;equence, which we neither acknowledge nor believe to be included in our Principle, in the Sen&s;e of our Opponents?</P>
<P>BUT to proceed immediately to the Objection: If there is &s;uch a Thing in the Church as Autho|rity from Chri&s;t, not immediately confered, but mediately derived down to the pre&s;ent Age; the Nece&s;&s;ity of an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion of Con|veyers is as clear, as that the whole is greater than its Parts. That the Power of Ordination was ori|ginally given to Bi&s;hops only, as an Order of Men &s;uperior to that of Pre&s;byters, is a Doctrine which we believe upon the Evidence of Scripture. And that for many Ages this Power was exerci&s;ed by Bi|&s;hops, and was not exerci&s;ed or claimed by any other Per&s;ons, and con&s;equently had no Exi&s;tence but in the Line of Bi&s;hops, is as certain, as the Concurrence of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory can make it. Whatever therefore may be the Con&s;e|quences of the Doctrine, with Regard to our&s;elves or others, our Belief of it appears to us to be founded upon invincible Evidence. And whenever any Doctrine appears to us to be evidently <HI>true,</HI> we think we ought to believe it, whether it be <HI>chari|table</HI> (if Charity may be predicated of Doctrines) or not.</P>
<P>AS to tho&s;e prote&s;tant Churches which are with|out Bi&s;hops; while this continues to be their Ca&s;e, they mu&s;t be manife&s;tly without that Authority which Chri&s;t has appropriated to Bi&s;hops. But then &s;uch is our <HI>Charity</HI> towards them, that we <HI>believe,</HI> upon the Evidence of their frequent and &s;olemn Declarations, that this is rather their Misfortune
<PB N="68" REF="011203_0078_0F94F9AF52EF59E0">
than their Fault; and therefore we <HI>hope</HI> (to u&s;e the Words of <HI>Bogerman,</HI> Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Synod of Dort,</HI> upon the &s;ame Subject) <HI>that God will be merciful to them.</HI> The Church of <HI>England</HI> has always treated all the foreign prote&s;tant Churches with a kind and &s;i&s;terly Affection. She indeed
<Q>holds the Nece&s;&s;ity of Bi&s;hops,</Q>
but not that Bi&s;hops are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch Churches as are unable to obtain them. In like Manner, She holds the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Sacra|ments, but not that they are nece&s;&s;ary to every In|dividual. She e&s;teems the Sacraments to be no more than "<HI>generally</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation," and not <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> &s;o; or, as She expre&s;&s;es it in &s;peaking of Bapti&s;m, She maintains
<Q>the great Nece&s;&s;ity of that Sacrament <HI>where it may be had.</HI></Q>
Thus, the Nece&s;&s;ity of Bi&s;hops is no more than a <HI>general</HI> Ne|ce&s;&s;ity; or, in other Words, Bi&s;hops, according to the Belief of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> are nece&s;|&s;ary only <HI>where they may be had.</HI> And if they are an In&s;titution of Chri&s;t, intended for the &s;tanding U&s;e of the Church, le&s;s than this cannot be believed, unle&s;s in a &s;ingle Ca&s;e hereafter to be excepted. The In&s;titutions of Chri&s;t we are bound to ob&s;erve, in Proportion to our Abilities and Opportunities, and he has promi&s;ed his Ble&s;&s;ing to us in the U&s;e of them; but where the&s;e are wanting, our De&s;ire of obeying him will undoubtedly be accepted, in&s;tead of Obedience. Where Chri&s;t has directed us in what Manner to act, his Direction is the Rule of our Duty; but it is no Rule to him&s;elf, and, whenever he plea&s;es, he may accompli&s;h to us the Ends, with|out our having made U&s;e of the Means or In&s;tru|ments.</P>
<P>WHETHER any of the foreign Churches, al|though de&s;irous of Bi&s;hops, are in Reality unable
<PB N="69" REF="011203_0079_0F94F9B00FC3E380">
to obtain them, is be&s;t known to them&s;elves. It might appear otherwi&s;e to us, but they have affirm|ed it to be true; and certainly it is more <HI>charita|ble</HI> to believe, than to di&s;believe, them. To prove the Sincerity of their Declarations, it is hoped, that whenever the Providence of God &s;hall give them an Opportunity of obtaining a prote&s;tant Epi&s;co|pate, they will readily and thankfully embrace it, as one of tho&s;e Churches has already done, &s;etting before them an Example worthy of all Imitation.
<Q>The Prote&s;tants of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> who were appre|hen&s;ive that Ordinations in which Pre&s;byters, and not a Bi&s;hop, &s;hould create another Pre&s;byter, would not be lawful; and were in Doubt how they &s;hould be able to maintain &s;uch an Ordina|tion, either to others when they oppo&s;ed, or to their own People, when they que&s;tioned it;&mdash; &s;ent Deputies to the Remains of the ancient <HI>Walden&s;es,</HI> upon the Confines of <HI>Moravia</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> by who&s;e Bi&s;hops the&s;e Deputies were con&s;ecrated to the epi&s;pocal office, which they have ever &s;ince tran&s;mitted to their Succe&s;&s;ors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Commenius</HI> in Frat. Bohem. Hi&s;toria, as quoted by Bi&s;hop <HI>Ellys.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>BUT if any of the foreign Churches have at length formed an Opinion that Bi&s;hops are need|le&s;s, and are in a Di&s;po&s;ition to refu&s;e an Epi&s;co|pate if they had it in their Power, which is the Ca&s;e of the Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Di&s;&s;en|ters; although we cannot but condemn &s;uch irre|gular and un&s;criptural Conduct, yet we mean not to exclude them from our Charity, nor do we de&s;ire to degrade them from the Rank of Chri&s;tians. For be&s;ides the Ca&s;es of Inability already mentioned, we believe that the Goodne&s;s of God may be al&s;o
<PB N="70" REF="011203_0080_0F94F9B0CD9372D8">
extended to Ca&s;es of hone&s;t and involuntary Igno|rance. Where Men, through the Force of Prejudice or of any imperceptible Bias, mi&s;take the Matter of their Duty, while they are earne&s;tly de&s;irous of knowing and performing it, we hope that the In|tegrity of their Hearts will be allowed, in a great Mea&s;ure, to atone for the Errors of their Under|&s;tandings. If a Per&s;on, duly qualified for &s;ome par|ticular Office, &s;hould endeavour to obtain the King's Commi&s;&s;ion, but through a Mi&s;take &s;hould receive a fictitious one in its Stead; although &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion is not the King's, and all his public Acts in Con&s;equence of it are &s;trictly <HI>illegal,</HI> yet a good King would be di&s;po&s;ed to overlook it, and to ratify tho&s;e Proceedings which were invalid in them&s;elves. In the &s;ame Manner, although we be|lieve that Pre&s;byterian Ordination does not convey Chri&s;t's Commi&s;&s;ion, which he was plea&s;ed to lodge in other Hands; yet as &s;ome Per&s;ons hone&s;tly mi&s;|take &s;uch Authority as is conveyed by it for his Commi&s;&s;ion, and by Virtue thereof endeavour to execute his Laws and Purpo&s;es relating to his Church, we hope the Irregularity of the Conduct will be forgiven them.</P>
<P>INDEED Per&s;ons of the &s;ame Spirit with that which governs &s;ome of our <HI>American</HI> Writers a|gain&s;t the Church, would probably &s;ay of it, in the Doctor's Language, that <HI>it is a vile Affront and Abomination to Chri&s;t,</HI> as it undoubtedly is when wilful and pre&s;umptous; but I cannot believe that, in any In&s;tance, Chri&s;t will receive what is &s;incerely intended to be an Act of Obedience, as an Affront and an Abomination. It concerns us to inquire ho|ne&s;tly, and with the greate&s;t Care, after the Will of our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, and if po&s;&s;ible not to mi&s;|take
<PB N="71" REF="011203_0081_0F94F9B260A5E518">
it; but after all, if we &s;hould unfortunately &s;till mi&s;take it, we have the Happine&s;s to know, that he is not extreme to mark what has been done ami&s;s, e&s;|pecially through Ignorance. We believe the Sacra|ments to have been in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, as Means "generally nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation;" but becau&s;e the People called Quakers, through a mi&s;taken Judg|ment, are without the Sacraments, are we to con|clude, that all the worthy and pious Per&s;ons of that religious Denomination, &s;hall fail of Salvation? And yet if our Opponents believe in the Manner that they argue, they mu&s;t look upon the mo&s;t vir|tuous Quakers upon Earth, as incapable of Hap|pine&s;s. The Truth is, whoever believes in Chri&s;t, and endeavours to obey him, however mi&s;taken he may have been in &s;ome In&s;tances of his Obedience, we tru&s;t will be accepted. Whoever makes it the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Life to fulfil the Conditions of the Go&s;pel-Covenant, notwith&s;tanding any apparent or unknown Defects in the Performance of his Duty, may expect the Ble&s;&s;ings of that Covenant, through the Merits and Mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. There are undoubtedly many &s;uch Per&s;ons, among Chri&s;|tians of every Denomination.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding, Mens Sincerity in the Be|lief of erroneous Principles and in Practices formed thereupon, can never be equal to Sincerity in right Practices e&s;tabli&s;hed upon ju&s;t Principles. A &s;in|cere Heathen or Mahometan is by no Means to be con&s;idered as upon a Level with a &s;incere Chri&s;ti|an; and among Chri&s;tians, we mu&s;t give the Pre|ference to tho&s;e that come neare&s;t to what we believe to be the true Standard of Faith and Practice, on Suppo&s;ition that their Sincerity is equal. A Man who imagines he has the King's Commi&s;&s;ion, but
<PB N="72" REF="011203_0082_0F94F9BE81C95DF0">
has it not in Reality, may endeavour to execute the King's Plea&s;ure, and otherwi&s;e act the Part of a good Subject, and as &s;uch he may be treated by his Sovereign; but &s;till, an authentic Commi&s;&s;ion is a better Thing than one that is &s;purious. And it greatly concerns every Man bearing a Commi&s;&s;i|on, to the Authenticity and Legality of which Ob|jections are made, to examine carefully in what Manner, and from what Authority, he has receiv|ed it.</P>
<P>THUS I have ventured, perhaps more freely than prudently, to expre&s;s my own Sentiments on this delicate Subject, and the Sub&s;tance of them may be reduced to the following Propo&s;itions: The Commi&s;&s;ion to ordain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Chri&s;tian Church, can be derived only from Chri&s;t&mdash;this Commi&s;&s;ion was originally given exclu&s;ively to Bi&s;hops&mdash;it has been brought down to the pre&s;ent Age by a regular uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops&mdash;tho&s;e who are without Bi&s;hops are con&s;equently without this Com|mi&s;&s;ion&mdash;notwith&s;tanding, where the Want of this Commi&s;&s;ion has been fairly owing to the Impracti|cability of obtaining it, it will not be imputed as criminal&mdash;and farther, where there is an Opportuni|ty of obtaining it, and Men neglect it, through a mi&s;taken, but hone&s;t, Belief, that they are already in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, it is hoped that the Goodne&s;s of God will overlook the Defect.</P>
<P>SHOULD I now be charged with wanting Chari|ty, I mu&s;t try to bear it as well as I can. I am con&s;cious that what I have &s;aid, has been offered with a Di&s;po&s;ition that is friendly to the whole human Race, by no Means exclu&s;ively of tho&s;e, upon whom it bears harde&s;t; and I hope it is not incon&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="73" REF="011203_0083_0F94F9BEA7CA5720">
with the Charity of a Chri&s;tian, which does not require us to believe contrary to Evidence, but only to put the mo&s;t favourable Con&s;truction upon Men's Actions, which they will fairly admit of. It would be well for the World, if we all cul|tivated this divine Temper more than we do. We &s;hould then take a Plea&s;ure in thinking, and &s;peak|ing, and writing of each other, as well as we can; and we &s;hould be careful not to carry on our Con|trover&s;ies, when they &s;hould happen to ari&s;e, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e wherein Religion is concerned, with the Malignity and Ferocity of Barbarians. If we were all under the Influence of that genuine Charity, which the Go&s;pel &s;o clearly explains, and injoins, and in&s;pires, we &s;hould not admire a Writer for &s;aying the bittere&s;t and &s;evere&s;t Things of tho&s;e that differ from us, however materially; and I much que&s;tion, whether a large, ill-natured, abu&s;ive Pam|phlet, written profe&s;&s;edly with the De&s;ign of lead|ing Men to believe, that
<Q>the Church of <HI>England</HI> and Church of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are Con&s;titutions of a <HI>quite</HI> different Nature,</Q>
would have run through &s;o many Re-Impre&s;&s;ions in this Country, and the Author have been &s;o frequently mentioned with &s;ingular Marks of Re&s;pect and Approbation.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed: The Doctor objects, that, ac|cording to the Doctrine of an uninterrupted Suc|ce&s;&s;ion in the Line of Bi&s;hops, <HI>if the popi&s;h Bi&s;hops, at the Reformation, had &s;tuck to their own Principles, and di&s;continued the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Mini&s;try by re|fu&s;ing to con&s;ecrate, or ordain any but tho&s;e of their own Communion,</HI> it would have been the Duty of Prote&s;tants to have contented them&s;elves, without public Wor&s;hip and the Ordinances of Religion. I believe the popi&s;h Bi&s;hops always &s;tuck to their

own Principles &s;o far, as not to con&s;ecrate or or|dain any but tho&s;e of their own Communion. The Doctor's Suppo&s;ition therefore will not an&s;wer the Purpo&s;e without another to &s;econd it, namely, that none of the popi&s;h Bi&s;hops, ordained at the Time of the Reformation, had turned Prote&s;tants after their Ordination; for if they had, the Succe&s;&s;ion might have been continued to us by &s;uch reformed Bi&s;hops, notwith&s;tanding the Refu&s;al of the popi&s;h Bi&s;hops to ordain any but tho&s;e of their own Com|munion: And while we are &s;uppo&s;ing, we may put the Ca&s;e, upon other Principles, that all the popi&s;h <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> had refu&s;ed to ordain any but Per&s;ons of their own Communion; and it will equally prove, that it would have been the Duty of Prote&s;tants, not to have formed them&s;elves into religious A&s;|&s;emblies. There is no guarding any Cau&s;e or any Argument, again&s;t &s;uch Suppo&s;itions as the&s;e. But why mu&s;t we have been without a Succe&s;&s;ion, if we had not received it from that Quarter? Might we not have applied to the <HI>Creek Church,</HI> or to the <HI>Walden&s;es,</HI> and have received it from them, as the <HI>Bohemians</HI> afterwards did?</P>
<P><HI>BUT the wor&s;t of the Doctrine of an uninterrup|ted Succe&s;&s;ion is &s;till behind; for it is derived through the Bi&s;hops of Rome, who for a hundred Years to|gether, were, as Baronius confe&s;&s;es,</HI>
<Q>Mon&s;ters for Ignorance, Lu&s;t, Pride and Luxury.</Q>
Now I cannot conceive that Chri&s;t's Authority is more contaminated by a Derivation through the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> than it would have been, had it been de|rived through the <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> who&s;e moral Characters were as infamous as tho&s;e of the Bi&s;hops.

<Q>Though we have &s;eparated from many Errors and Corruptions of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and in particular have thrown out many &s;uper&s;titious Rites out of the Forms of Ordination, that we might reduce the&s;e to a primitive Simplicity; yet as we acknowledge the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> holds &s;till the Fundamentals of the Chri&s;tian Religion; &s;o we confe&s;s She retains the E&s;&s;entials of Ordi|nation.&mdash;Therefore we do not annul their Orders, but receive &s;uch as come from that Church, and look upon them as true Prie&s;ts by the Ordination they got among them, and &s;uch were our fir&s;t Reformers, from whom we have derived our Ordination <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vindication of the Ordinations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 61.</NOTE></Q>.</P>

<P>WE now come to the Doctor's Objections to the Arguments in Favour of Epi&s;copacy, which were &s;ketched out in the <HI>Appeal</HI>; but I have alrea|dy
<PB N="77" REF="011203_0087_0F94F9C20A963868">
been detained &s;o long in &s;ettling Preliminaries, that I pre&s;ume the Reader will freely con&s;ent to my pa&s;&s;ing over, for the pre&s;ent, this Part of his Per|formance. At the Time of writing the <HI>Appeal,</HI> it was imagined that giving a Summary of the Evi|dence in Support of the Doctrine of Epi&s;copacy, and an Explanation of the &s;everal Branches of the epi&s;copal Office, would contribute to place the Plea for an <HI>American</HI> Epi&s;copate in a fuller and fairer View, than could otherwi&s;e be had; but I am now convinced, that what was &s;aid on the general Subject, however ju&s;t in it&s;elf, or proper in Theory, had been better omited. Our Adver&s;aries have eagerly laid hold of a Subject, which has been already de|bated for almo&s;t 200 Years, and will probably be debated for 200 Years to come; and by this Means have kept the principal Object of this Controver&s;y, which is an <HI>American</HI> Epi&s;copate, at a Di&s;tance, and as much as po&s;&s;ible out of Sight. The Doctor &s;eems to have acted upon this Plan, exerting him|&s;elf upon the Subject of Epi&s;copacy, as if it was his chief Bu&s;ine&s;s in an&s;wering the <HI>Appeal</HI>; where|as the Curio&s;ity of the Public called him to pur&s;ue another Object&mdash;an Object, from which therefore I propo&s;e to be no longer diverted, by an endle&s;s Di&s;pute concerning Epi&s;copacy. Whether we are right or wrong in our Notions of Epi&s;copacy, yet that we <HI>believe</HI> Bi&s;hops to have been of apo&s;tolical In&s;titution, and that they are an e&s;&s;ential Part in the Con&s;titution of our Church, is &s;ufficient to intitle us to an Epi&s;copate; unle&s;s Rea&s;on can be &s;hewn, which it is the grand Bu&s;ine&s;s of our Opponents to &s;hew, why the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in the Colo|nies, &s;hould not be &s;uffered to enjoy its own religi|ous In&s;titutions, while every other Denomination of Chri&s;tians is compleatly tolerated. I propo&s;e
<PB N="78" REF="011203_0088_0F94F9C32F42E468">
therefore, as has been intimated, to pa&s;s over all that has been &s;aid on the general Subject of Epi&s;|copacy, &s;o far as it relates to the Evidence of Scrip|ture and the primitive Church. Nor let the Doctor complain that I decline this Debate; for I mean only to defer it to a more convenient Time. When we &s;hall have &s;ettled the Point of an <HI>American</HI> E|pi&s;copate, I will endeavour to hold my&s;elf in Rea|dine&s;s to an&s;wer his farther Demands.</P>
<P>AN Extract from <HI>Chillingworth's Demon&s;tration of Epi&s;copacy</HI> concluded the fir&s;t Section of the <HI>Appeal.</HI> This the Doctor does not attempt to con|fute; but he di&s;covers half a Mind to get rid of it another Way, by &s;erving it as he before had &s;erved St. <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s Epi&s;tles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix to the <HI>Dudleian Lecture.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>It is,</HI> &s;ays he, p. 30, <HI>&s;trange &mdash;that be &s;hould write in the Manner he is here</HI> REPRESENTED <HI>to have done in Relation to Epi&s;copacy.</HI> Does he then demur to the Authenticity of the <HI>Demon&s;tration,</HI> and &s;u&s;pect that <HI>Chillingworth</HI> was not the Author of it! If he can make this appear, he will not be obliged to encounter with the Au|thority of &s;o great a Name, which is the only Ad|vantage to be expected from it; but the <HI>Demon&s;tra|tion</HI> will &s;till remain, and the Argument in Favour of Epi&s;copacy will be as conclu&s;ive, whoever may have been the Author of it. He confronts the Extract I had given with a Pa&s;&s;age from the great Work, <HI>The Religion of Prote&s;tants a &s;afe Way to Salvation</HI>; in which Pa&s;&s;age the &s;ame Au|thor declares, that
<Q>the BIBLE only is the Religion of Prote&s;tants;</Q>
but this is not incon&s;i&s;tent with any Thing advanced in the <HI>Demon&s;tration.</HI> Where he allows us to appeal to "the Bible ONLY," he is &s;peaking of the Rule of Faith in its &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e;
<PB N="79" REF="011203_0089_0F94F9C3921C2778">
and he u&s;es no more than the common Language of Prote&s;tants, of Epi&s;copalians, as well as others. But with Regard to Matters of a different Nature, we find him allowing proper Weight to the Te&s;timony of Antiquity. Thus in Chap. v.82. &s;peaking of the various Sects of Prote&s;tants, he &s;ays,
<Q>They did <HI>be&s;t</HI> that followed Scripture <HI>interpreted by catholic written Tradition</HI>; which Rule the Re|formers of the Church of <HI>England</HI> propo&s;ed to them&s;elves to follow.</Q>
I might produce from him many other Expre&s;&s;ions to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. And although he mentions
<Q>Popes again&s;t Popes, Coun|cils again&s;t Councils, &s;ome Fathers again&s;t o|thers,</Q>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet he is not there &s;peaking of the pure and primitive Ages of the Church, but of tho&s;e &s;ucceeding ones which had gro&s;sly departed from the original Standard.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the Pretence that <HI>Chil|lingworth</HI> is on his Side, the Doctor, upon the whole, not liking his Sentiments, appeals from him to <HI>much greater Men in the Knowledge of Antiquity,</HI> and particularly to <HI>that great Antiquary, the learned Arch|bi&s;hop U&s;her,</HI> who, it &s;eems, <HI>in a Letter to Dr. Ber|nard,</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>I have ever declared my Opinion to be, that Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter differ only in De|gree, not in Order.</Q>
The Letter goes on in the&s;e Words, omited by Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>&mdash;
<Q>and con|&s;equently that in Places where Bi&s;hops cannot be had, the Ordination by Pre&s;byters &s;tandeth va|lid; yet on the other Side holding as I do, that a Bi&s;hop hath Superiority in Degree above a Pre&s;byter, you may ea&s;ily judge that the Ordi|nation made by &s;uch Pre&s;byters, as have &s;evered them&s;elves from tho&s;e Bi&s;hops, unto whom they had &s;worn canonical Obedience, cannot po&s;&s;ibly

<HI>by me</HI> be excu&s;ed from being <HI>&s;chi&s;matical</HI>; And how&s;oever, I mu&s;t needs think that the Churches, which have no Bi&s;hops, are thereby become <HI>very much defective in their Government,</HI> and that the Churches in <HI>France,</HI> who living under a popi&s;h Power, cannot do what they would, are more excu&s;able in this Defect, than the Low-Coun|tries that live under a free State</Q>
&mdash;and then come the other Words cited by the Doctor, with which the Archbi&s;hop concludes his Letter.</P>
<P>THE Reader can hardly avoid remarking here, that, in the Opinion of <HI>that learned Antiquary,</HI> al|though Ordination by Pre&s;byters in Ca&s;es of Nece&s;|&s;ity may be valid, yet Ordination by Pre&s;byters in other Circum&s;tances is not to be
<Q>excu&s;ed from being &s;chi&s;matical</Q>
&mdash;that all Churches without Bi&s;hops are "very much defective in their Government"&mdash;
<Q>and that the Churches in <HI>France</HI> are in this Re&s;|pect <HI>more excu&s;able</HI> than tho&s;e in the Low-Coun|tries,</Q>
becau&s;e they are le&s;s able to remedy this Defect. As &s;o full an Explanation immediately fol|lows the Declaration of his Opinion,
<Q>that Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters differ only in Degree,</Q>
we may &s;afely conclude that the Primate was rather &s;ingu|lar in his Mode of Expre&s;&s;ion, than in his real Senti|ments, with Regard to Epi&s;copacy. There is a Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>the Hi&s;tory of the Council of</HI> CONSTANCE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By L'Enfant, Vol. II. p. 27.</NOTE>, which will, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, account for this Peculiarity of Expre&s;&s;ion. The Hi&s;torian, giving an Ab&s;tract of <HI>Ger&s;on</HI>'s Book <HI>concerning eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power,</HI> informs us, that
<Q>Ger&s;on <HI>ob&s;erves there is &s;ome Difference between the Sentiments of the Lawyers and Divines concerning Epi&s;copacy.</HI> The Lawyers, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> call Epi&s;copacy an Order,
<PB N="81" REF="011203_0091_0F94F9C605B4A5C8">
becau&s;e 'tis above the Prie&s;thood. Though the Di|vines agree, that Epi&s;copacy is a hierarchical Power above the Prie&s;thood, yet they do not &s;ay that it is an Order, becau&s;e it adds nothing to the Power of the Prie&s;t over the true Body of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, therefore it is not a new Order, but a new Power.</Q>
From this Account it appears that be|fore the Reformation although it was the general O|pinion that
<Q>Epi&s;copacy is a hierarchical Power above the Prie&s;thood,</Q>
or "a new Power" added to that of Pre&s;byters, which Power was known al|ways to have been communicated by a new Ordina|tion; yet in the Language of the Divines, in Con|tradi&s;tinction to that of the Lawyers, it was not called a di&s;tinct <HI>Order.</HI> Now it is natural enough to &s;uppo&s;e that an <HI>Antiquary,</HI> one that is conver&s;ant in the Writings of tho&s;e Divines that lived Ages before him in the Times of Popery, although a &s;ound Prote&s;tant as the Primate was, may have fallen into &s;ome Part of their Phra&s;eology, and con&s;equently that he may have u&s;ed the particular Words, <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Degree</HI> in a Sen&s;e &s;omewhat dif|ferent from that wherein they were u&s;ed by his Co|temporaries. A <HI>real Difference</HI> between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters he certainly admitted, and perhaps al|lowed the Difference to be as great as is contended for; and in that Ca&s;e it matters not whether it be expre&s;&s;ed by the Word <HI>Order,</HI> or <HI>Degree.</HI> It may a&s;&s;i&s;t us in forming a Judgment of the Archbi|&s;hop's Opinion concerning this Point, to bear in our Minds that he fully believed the Epi&s;tles of St. <HI>Ignatius</HI> to be genuine; for it is impo&s;&s;ible for any Man, with this Belief, to doubt, whether in the Beginning of the <HI>&s;econd Century,</HI> the Church was governed by Bi&s;hops, as di&s;tinct from, and &s;u|perior to, Pre&s;byters.</P>

<Q>which originally and e&s;&s;en|tially belong</Q>
to it.

be added; nor is it his Bu&s;ine&s;s as an An&s;werer to me, to &s;ay any Thing of its being <HI>unrea&s;onable.</HI> Much le&s;s was it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to object Appendages of this Kind to an Epi&s;copate, which it certainly is, and ever was, intended, &s;hall exi&s;t without them. And yet both the Doctor and our weekly Adver&s;aries, have expended a great deal of Time and Paper in very impertinent Declamation upon this Subject.</P>
<P>I HAD Occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that
<Q>he who has a &s;mall Dioce&s;s, has the &s;ame epi&s;copal Powers, as he that has a large one; and it Matters not, as to the Validity of the Act, whether it be per|formed</Q>
by one or the other. The Doctor an&s;|wers, that <HI>it certainly does as to his Capacity to &s;erve the great Ends of his Office</HI>&mdash;and that there <HI>is, in Proportion, the &s;ame Incongruity</HI> in placing Bi&s;hops <HI>at the Head of large Dioce&s;&s;es,</HI> as in having <HI>an uni|ver&s;al One.</HI> This, con&s;idered likewi&s;e as an An&s;|wer to me, and in no other Light are we authoriz|ed to con&s;ider it, amounts to no more than this; that although what I &s;aid is allowed to be true, yet Something that I did <HI>not</HI> &s;ay is certainly fal&s;e. The Thing which I did <HI>not</HI> &s;ay is, that a Bi&s;hop is as able <HI>to &s;erve the great Ends of his Office</HI> in a large Dioce&s;s, as in a &s;mall one. And yet if I had &s;aid this, unle&s;s the large Dioce&s;s is &s;uppo&s;ed to be lar|ger than the large&s;t in any prote&s;tant Country, or in the primitive Church, to which only I had Refe|rence; and the &s;mall one, &s;maller than the &s;malle&s;t, it would not have been &s;o very exceptionable. The larger Dioce&s;&s;es in <HI>England</HI> have commonly been as well taken Care of, as the &s;maller ones; and &s;hould any of them hereafter, by an Increa&s;e of the Inha|bitants, be found to be too large for the Dioce&s;ans,

Provi&s;ion is made that they may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Suf|fragans, in Proportion as they are wanted. The Doctor &s;eems to judge of the epi&s;copal Charge, upon congregational Principles, confounding the Office of a Bi&s;hop with that of a Pari&s;h Mini&s;ter; which is like confounding the Duty of a Lord Lieutenant of a County, with that of a Mayor of a Corporation.</P>
<P>I SHALL now pa&s;s on to his Exceptions in p. 42, to what I had &s;aid of <HI>A&euml;rius</HI> and <HI>Colluthus</HI>; name|ly, that they were
<Q>the fir&s;t Contrivers of Ordi|nation</Q>
by Pre&s;byters. Concerning the former, the Doctor endeavours to con&s;ole him&s;elf with the&s;e Reflections, that <HI>Epiphanius was the fir&s;t that found Fault with A&euml;rius,</HI> and that <HI>A&euml;rius</HI> was <HI>condemned not only and meerly for his Opinion concerning the Parity of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters.</HI> But as to <HI>Epi|phanius</HI>'s being the fir&s;t Per&s;on that <HI>found Fault</HI> with <HI>A&euml;rius,</HI> why might not he have been the fir&s;t, as well as any other Per&s;on? The Doctor, I hope, knows, that <HI>A&euml;rius</HI> and <HI>Epiphanius</HI> were Cotempo|raries; the former broached his Here&s;y under <HI>Va|lentinian,</HI> who was inve&s;ted with the Empire, in 364, and <HI>Epiphanius</HI> was made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salamis,</HI> in 366, according to <HI>Du Pin.</HI> If an Intimation is in|tended that <HI>Epiphanius</HI> was the <HI>only</HI> Per&s;on that, at fir&s;t, con&s;idered the Doctrine of <HI>A&euml;rius</HI> as excep|tionable, or, in other Words, that <HI>the Parity of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters</HI> was generally admitted in the <HI>fourth Century,</HI> the Sugge&s;tion is groundle&s;s. The united Voice of Antiquity, and even the Conce&s;&s;i|ons of our mo&s;t con&s;iderable Adver&s;aries, prove the contrary with invincible Evidence. If the Mean|ing be, that <HI>Epiphanius</HI> was the fir&s;t that <HI>wrote</HI> again&s;t <HI>A&euml;rias</HI>; the Chronology of the Facts ought
<PB N="87" REF="011203_0097_0F94F9CD48A6C478">
to be more exactly a&s;certained, before any Thing material can be collected from this Circum&s;tance. <HI>Epiphanius</HI> began to write his Book <HI>of Here&s;ies,</HI> according to <HI>Du Pin</HI>'s Account, in 374, but when <HI>A&euml;rius</HI> fir&s;t made him&s;elf obnoxious, except in ge|neral that it was in the Reign of the Emperor <HI>Va|lentinian,</HI> extending from 364 to 375, I do not find. Perhaps it may have been but a &s;hort Time before <HI>Epiphanius</HI> wrote again&s;t him:&mdash;Or, &s;uppo&s;ing it otherwi&s;e, perhaps <HI>A&euml;rius</HI> him&s;elf, and the Progre&s;s of his Doctrine, were at fir&s;t too incon&s;iderable to de&s;erve Notice:&mdash;and perhaps there may be Some|thing in the Ca&s;e, which, at this Di&s;tance, we can|not account for. If the Doctor thinks this la&s;t Sup|po&s;ition can be of any Service to him, he is hear|tily welcome to it.</P>
<P>IF <HI>A&euml;rius</HI> was not condemned <HI>only and merely,</HI> it is &s;ufficient for my Purpo&s;e that he was condemned <HI>chiefly, for his Opinion concerning the Parity of Bi|&s;hops and Pre&s;byters.</HI> And that this was the prin|cipal Cau&s;e of his Condemnation, appears from all the Accounts I have met with. The learned <HI>Mo&s;heim</HI> gives this brief Account of the Matter:
<Q>About this Time, <HI>A&euml;rius,</HI> a Pre&s;byter, Monk and Semi-Arian, erected a <HI>new</HI> Sect, and exci|ted Divi&s;ions throughout <HI>Armenia, Pontus,</HI> and <HI>Cappadocia,</HI> by propagating Opinions different from tho&s;e that were <HI>commonly received.</HI> One of his <HI>principal</HI> Tenets was, that Bi&s;hops were not di&s;tingui&s;hed from Pre&s;byters by any divine Right; but that, according to the In&s;titution of the New-Te&s;tament, their Offices and Authority were ab&s;olutely the &s;ame. How far <HI>A&euml;rius</HI> pur|&s;ued this Opinion, through its natural Con&s;e|quences, is not certainly known<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, Vol. I. p. 202.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="011203_0098_0F94F9CE776A89E8">THE Doctor thinks I had <HI>no Need, nor any Rea|&s;on to join Colluthus with A&euml;rius; for he did not act in the Capacity of, what Epi&s;copalians would call, a meer Pre&s;byter, in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of ordaining; but as a Bi&s;hop.</HI> But I thought it a very &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for joining him with <HI>A&euml;rius,</HI> that he acted in that <HI>Capacity,</HI> when he was, in Reality, no more than <HI>what Epi&s;copalians would call,</HI> and the Orthodox of that Age did call, <HI>a meer Pre&s;byter.</HI> The true State of the Ca&s;e of <HI>Colluthus</HI> may be gathered, from the &s;ynodical Epi&s;tle of the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Egypt, Thebais, Lybia</HI> and <HI>Pentapolis</HI>&mdash;and from a joint Letter of the Clergy of the Province of <HI>Mareotis,</HI> both pre&s;erved in the Works of <HI>Athana&s;ius.</HI> The &s;ynodical Epi&s;tle of tho&s;e <HI>African</HI> Bi&s;hops, &s;peak|ing of the Ca&s;e of one <HI>I&s;chyras,</HI> whom <HI>Colluthus</HI> ordained, ob&s;erves:

But <HI>Colluthus</HI> died a Pre&s;byter, &s;o that all the Im|po&s;itions of his Hands were invalid and null; and all tho&s;e, whom he ordained in his Schi&s;m, are well known to have been reduced to the Laity.</Q>
The Clergy of <HI>Mareotis</HI> give the like Repre&s;entation of the Matter.
<Q><HI>I&s;chyras</HI> who calls him&s;elf a Pre&s;byter, is not a Pre&s;byter, &s;ince he was ordained by <HI>Colluthus,</HI> who a&s;&s;umed an ima|ginary Epi&s;copacy, and was afterwards com|manded by <HI>Ho&s;ius,</HI> and other Bi&s;hops &s;ynodically a&s;&s;embled, to return to the Order of Pre&s;byters, whereto he was ordained.

I leave it now with the Reader to judge whether <HI>Colluthus acted in the Capacity of a meer Pre&s;byter, in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of ordaining,</HI> or <HI>as a Bi&s;hop</HI>; and whether it was improper to join him with <HI>A&euml;rius,</HI> or not. If after all, the Doctor choo&s;es to give up the Example of <HI>Colluthus,</HI> as not fa|vouring the Cau&s;e of Ordination by Pre&s;byters, I certainly can have no Objection.</P>
<P>IT was &s;aid in the <HI>Appeal,</HI>
<Q>that there is not an In&s;tance of Ordination by Pre&s;byters to be found in the Church for &s;everal Ages.</Q>
Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> in his Reply, after remarking that the&s;e Words imply that there are <HI>numerous</HI> Examples of epi&s;copal Or|dination within the &s;ame Period, calls upon me in p. 44, very emphatically to produe ONE <HI>In&s;tance, within the long Period of</HI> 150 <HI>Years from Chri&s;t, of an Ordination by any Bi&s;hop, in any Part of the Chri&s;tian World; meaning by a Bi&s;hop an Of|ficer in the Church of a &s;uperior Order to that of Pre&s;byters.</HI> So far all is very fair. But behold, Reader, a Curio&s;ity. This very &s;ame Challenge he made in his <HI>Dudleian Lecture,</HI> p. 70; to which a formal and direct An&s;wer has been given by Mr. <HI>Leaming.</HI> His Words are as follow:
<Q>I will com|ply with his (Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s) Demand; and I hope he will allow the Authority of my Author. I might produce many, but for Brevity's Sake, &s;hall mention but one In&s;tance: And that is the Ordination of <HI>Titus</HI> by St. <HI>Paul.</HI> That <HI>Titus</HI> had an epi&s;copal Ordination, appears from the Charge St. <HI>Paul</HI> gave him, Tit. i.5. <HI>For this Cau&s;e left I thee in Crete, that thou &s;houlde&s;t &s;et in Order the Things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in

This Authority is clearly expre&s;&s;ed, and the Bounds, in which he was to exerci&s;e it, di&s;tinctly marked out. Thus it ap|pears, that this was an <HI>epi&s;copal Ordination</HI> in our Sen&s;e of the Matter. Our Bi&s;hops claim nothing but the very &s;ame Power, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> gave to <HI>Titus</HI> over the I&s;land of <HI>Crete</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Defence of the Epi&s;copal Government, p. 61.</NOTE>.</Q>
Is not this a fair and full An&s;wer to the Doctor's Demand? Ought he then to be un&s;atisfied, when all that he a&s;ks has been given him? Is it not very extraordi|nary that he &s;hould &s;o roundly repeat the Demand, without the lea&s;t Notice of Mr. <HI>Leaming</HI>'s An&s;wer? I have &s;ometimes met with Per&s;ons who would al|ledge the Arguments of <HI>others</HI> that had been an&s;|wered, and the Objections of <HI>others</HI> that had been confuted, without taking Notice of the &s;aid An&s;|wers and Confutations; but Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> is the fir&s;t Man I have found in any of the Regions of Con|trover&s;y, that could, without any Symptoms of Perturbation, deal thus with <HI>his own</HI> Arguments and Objections, after they had been formally an&s;|wered and confuted. As this and &s;ome other Things are again&s;t him, it is a Pity he "undertook" the "Work" of an&s;wering the <HI>Appeal,</HI> without con&s;ulting his Brethren; and "that he was" not "a&s;&s;i&s;ted in it, as&mdash;to the Management" of &s;ome particular Parts of it,
<Q>by Direction from &s;o learned and able a Body of Men.</Q>
Had he
<Q>been favoured with &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing Advan|tages,</Q>
<PB N="91" REF="011203_0101_0F94F9D64B8328A8">
the few Blemi&s;hes upon the Face of his Compo&s;ition might have been avoided.</P>
<P>THE Doctor, in p. 45, pronounces me to have been <HI>egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken, in &s;aying, that from the fourth Centu|ry, until the Beginning of the Reformation in the &s;ixteenth,</HI>
<Q>no In&s;tances worthy of Notice occur, to favour Ordination by Pre&s;byters:</Q>
And to convince me of my egregious Mi&s;take, he points out, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. <HI>Daniel Williams</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thomas Walter,</HI> the Example of the <HI>Walden&s;es.</HI> But upon Examination it will be found, that tho&s;e two Gen|tlemen happened to be <HI>egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken</HI> them|&s;elves. We have already &s;een, that the <HI>Bohemians</HI> had Bi&s;hops con&s;ecrated by the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI>; which &s;hews that the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> then really were, and by o|thers were known to be, Epi&s;copalians. They were moreover &s;uch <HI>High-Flyers,</HI> that they claimed an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion in the Line of Bi&s;hops, as &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters.

<Q>And whereas the &s;aid <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> did affirm that they had lawful Bi&s;hops, and a lawful UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESSION FROM THE APOSTLES unto this Day; they created Three of our Mini&s;ters &s;olemnly Bi&s;hops, and confered upon them Power to ordain Mini&s;ters.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For this Account I am obliged to the Author of <HI>the In|validity of the di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;try,</HI> in An&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Owen</HI>; and he farther informs us, that by a <HI>Brief</HI> read in the Churches throughout <HI>England,</HI> for obtaining for the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> charita|ble A&s;&s;i&s;tance, not long before his writing, which was in 1717, it clearly appeared, that they were epi&s;copal Churches, like the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for which they always pray in their Liturgy.</NOTE></Q>
One of the mo&s;t celebrated modern eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;to|rians,
<PB N="92" REF="011203_0102_0F94F9D708961EC0">
who is far from being partial to the Cau&s;e of Epi&s;copacy, giving an Account of the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> in the <HI>twelfth</HI> Century, &s;ays of them: "The Go|vernment of the Church was committed by the <HI>Walden&s;es,</HI> to Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters and Deacons;

But of all Authors, Dr. <HI>Allix</HI> appears to have made the mo&s;t effectual Examination into the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Walden&s;es,</HI> and to have under&s;tood it the mo&s;t perfectly. This very eminent Writer in his <HI>Re|marks upon the ancient Churches of Piedmont,</HI> has abundantly proved, that the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> always pre|&s;erved, under all their Per&s;ecutions and Di&s;per&s;ions, the &s;ame Form of Church-Government, from the Time of their Separation from the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in the <HI>eleventh</HI> Century; and that they di&s;tingui&s;hed their Clergy into three Orders, <HI>viz.</HI> Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Deacons. He proves this even from the Te&s;ti|monies of tho&s;e Enemies, who endeavoured to fix upon them the Reproach of allowing the Laity to preach and admini&s;ter the Sacraments. He proves it more fully from their own Writers, and even from the Example of that very <HI>Leger,</HI> whom Dr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> following Mr. <HI>Walter,</HI> has introduced to give Evidence to the contrary. For <HI>Leger</HI> him&s;elf was a <HI>Walden&s;ian</HI> Bi&s;hop for twelve Years before his Death, exerci&s;ing all the Powers that belong to the epi&s;copal Office. Thus having examined all that has been offered on the other Side, I find my|&s;elf more firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, by the Doctor's Op|po&s;ition, in my Belief of the Propo&s;ition advanced in the <HI>Appeal,</HI>
<Q>that the uniform Practice of the Church for 1500 Years, may be added to the
<PB N="93" REF="011203_0103_0F94F9D811D235C8">
Evidence of Scripture, in Support of the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of epi&s;copal Ordination.</Q></P>
<P>WE now come to the Subject of Confirmation. The Doctor pa&s;&s;es over what I had &s;aid of its Na|ture and U&s;efulne&s;s; the Rea&s;on for which, is left to the Reader's Sagacity to di&s;cover. But he favours me, in p. 47, with &s;ome critical Remarks upon the Paragraph, wherein I had made an Ob&s;ervation, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> declares of Confirmation,
<Q>that it hath been a &s;olemn, ancient and laudable Cu&s;tom, continued <HI>from the Apo&s;tles Time</HI>;</Q>
and wherein I endeavoured to &s;hew the Meaning of that Expre&s;&s;ion. My rea&s;oning upon this Head he &s;tyles <HI>eminently curious,</HI> and cries out, <HI>demon&s;trably argued! Is Infallibility the</HI> PECULIAR <HI>Privilege of the Church?</HI> But had he attended to the Paragraph, he might have &s;een that my De&s;ign therein was, to prove what the Church of <HI>England</HI> believes concerning the Antiquity and Origin of Confirmation; and not to <HI>a&s;certain the Truth of a di&s;puted Fact,</HI> by the Au|thority of the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s A&s;&s;ertion. However the Doctor has gained this Advantage by his Mi&s;take; he has &s;hewn that he is able occa|&s;ionlly to enliven and embelli&s;h his Style with rhe|torical Decorations. By his interrogating whether Infallibity is the <HI>peculiar</HI> Privilege of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> one would be apt to imagine, that he claimed the Privilege of Infallibility for other Churches, and particularly for tho&s;e <HI>of the Colo|nies</HI>; but I hope this was not intended, and that there is in Reality nothing more in it than a &s;mall Slip of his Pen.</P>
<P>IN p. 49, I am accu&s;ed of unfairly quoting a Text of Scripture; a Crime which I hold in Abhorrence.
<PB N="94" REF="011203_0104_0F94F9DC080B3FF8">
De&s;ignedly to mi&s;repre&s;ent any common Author, is a Species of Inju&s;tice which no hone&s;t Man will ever con&s;ent to practice; but to treat the in&s;pired Wri|ters of holy Scripture in this Manner, is impious and abominable. I am &s;orry Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> could think me capable of committing &s;uch a flagrant Act of Impiety, knowingly and wilfully; and yet from &s;ome of his Expre&s;&s;ions, I conclude that he thought me, or, at lea&s;t, that he intended his Rea|ders &s;hould think me, capable of doing &s;o. The Text which I am charged with mi&s;quoting, is <HI>Acts</HI> xix. 6, which he has heedle&s;sly marked <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 7. The whole Ver&s;e is thus:
<Q>And when <HI>Paul</HI> had laid his Hands upon them, the Holy Gho&s;t came on them; and they &s;pake with Tongues and prophe&s;ied.</Q>
I am charged with &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the latter Part of the Text, becau&s;e if I had given the whole Ver&s;e, <HI>it would have been, at once, vi&s;ible to the Reader, that it would have been nothing to</HI> my <HI>Purpo&s;e.</HI> Would not any one from hence conclude, that I looked upon the latter Part of the Ver&s;e, as overthrowing the Doctrine which I was aiming to e&s;tabli&s;h by the former Part of it? Would he not infer, that I had carefully concealed from the Rea|der tho&s;e Words which made again&s;t my De&s;ign? Whereas, in Truth, I neither looked upon the Words at fir&s;t omited, as <HI>really</HI> unfavourable to my Argument; nor did I mean to conceal them, for that or any other Rea&s;on; nor did I, in Fact, conceal them, but &s;oon after produced them in the Form of an Objection, and gave them all the Con|&s;ideration I thought nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>TO &s;et this Matter in a proper Light, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the former Part of the Ver&s;e in Que&s;|tion, in p. 21, of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> is introduced as be|ing
<PB N="95" REF="011203_0105_0F94F9DDD088A2B0">
exactly parallel with another Text quoted in the preceding Page. Without going on to the End of the Ver&s;e, but only to the End of the Parallel, I made a Stop (the Doctor &s;ays I <HI>&s;hamefully</HI> &s;topped &s;hort) to point out, how exactly the one De&s;crip|tion an&s;wered to the other, and to &s;hew that they both manife&s;tly related to the &s;ame Office of Con|firmation. I then went on to an&s;wer the Objections that might be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e, again&s;t my Inter|pretation; and among&s;t the&s;e Objections, I placed before the Reader tho&s;e very Words, which I am accu&s;ed of having <HI>kept out of Sight.</HI> Whoever will be kind enough to turn to p. 23, of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> will find that I acted fairly with the Objection, and endeavoured to do it Ju&s;tice. From whence it is evident, that I could have had no De&s;ign to &s;up|pre&s;s or conceal the Words in Di&s;pute; or el&s;e that I failed of my De&s;ign, &s;ince I actually did not &s;up|pre&s;s or conceal them. I might indeed have quoted them in clo&s;e Connection with the preceding Part of the Ver&s;e; but I thought it &s;ufficient to quote them, when I &s;hould come to con&s;ider them. When I con&s;idered them, I &s;uppo&s;ed no Per&s;on would ob|ject them, who did not know their Connection as u&s;ed by the &s;acred Hi&s;torian; the Knowledge of which I had no De&s;ire to conceal from any one. By this Time I hope the Reader is &s;atisfied, that I am free from the Guilt imputed to me; and that the Doctor has, I will not &s;ay, <HI>&s;hamefully,</HI> but however not much to his Honor, mi&s;repre&s;ented the whole Matter.</P>
<P>HE concludes what he has to &s;ay on the Subject of Confirmation, with a long Extract from the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Gentleman</HI>'s An&s;wer to Mr. <HI>White</HI>; the De&s;ign of which is to &s;hew, that the Bi&s;hop has no <HI>Warrant to pronounce,</HI> in the Admini&s;tration of that
<PB N="96" REF="011203_0106_0F94F9DF26FB2040">
Office, <HI>a Man's Sins all forgiven, and him&s;elf re|generated by the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> In An&s;wer to this Harangue, it will be &s;ufficient to give the Words of Mr. <HI>White.</HI>
<Q>I have now, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> only to clear up one or two Pa&s;&s;ages in the Office for Con|firmation, and to re&s;cue them from the perver&s;e Interpretation of this Writer. The fir&s;t is that, wherein the Bi&s;hop declares, concerning tho&s;e that come to Confirmation, that <HI>God has vouch|&s;afed to regenerate tho&s;e his Servants by Water and the Holy Gho&s;t, and given them the Forgivene&s;s of all their Sins.</HI> This he is plea&s;ed to under&s;tand as a Declaration concerning their pre&s;ent State, and an A&s;&s;urance that they are, <HI>all,</HI> though &s;ome of them may be ab&s;olute <HI>Strangers to the renewing Influences of God's Spirit, and fa&s;t bound in their Sins,</HI> in a State of Grace and Acceptance, and need not doubt of their Salvation. Whereas, it is very plain, from the mention of Water, and their being regenerated thereby, that it is only declarative of the State they were put into by Bapti&s;m, they having received therein, or being thereby intitled to the Holy Spirit, and the Forgivene&s;s of all Sin.&mdash;But though the State which they were put into when they received their Bapti&s;m, was, doubtle&s;s, the State which is here meant, yet, for Argument's Sake, I will admit what this Gentleman <HI>begs</HI> me to admit (for he offers no Proof of it) that the Bi&s;hop means the State they are &s;uppo&s;ed, <HI>at pre&s;ent,</HI> to be in. And now we will &s;ee, if this Decla|ration from the Bi&s;hop, even in <HI>this</HI> View, be really &s;uch an unwarrantable and pre&s;umptuous one as our Author repre&s;ents it to be, and is not fairly defen&s;ible.</Q></P>

And as the far greater Part of the&s;e are very young Per&s;ons, whom the Bi&s;hop may rea|&s;onably, or in the Judgment of Charity, believe not to be yet defiled with <HI>the Pollutions that are in the World through Lu&s;t,</HI> and mo&s;t of the Re&s;t, who are of advanced Years, Men &s;eemingly &s;erious, and having a Di&s;po&s;ition to real Holine&s;s, and he does not know for certain, there are <HI>any</HI> among&s;t them, but can only pre&s;ume, that, in &s;o great a Number, there may probably be &s;ome of another Character, I do not &s;ee but the Bi&s;hop is &s;ufficiently warranted to make &s;uch a Declara|tion concerning them, as he does here.

<P>MR. <HI>White</HI> then goes on to &s;hew, in the Words of Dr. <HI>Doddridge,</HI> that the &s;ame Form of Expre&s;|&s;ion which is blamed in our Office for Confirmation, was commonly u&s;ed by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles.
<Q>Our Lord, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Doddridge,</HI> tho' he knew the Wickedne&s;s of <HI>Judas,</HI> often addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the whole Body of his Apo&s;tles, as if they were <HI>all</HI> his faithful Servants, and makes gracious Declarations and Promi&s;es to <HI>the whole Society,</HI>

which could by no Means be applicable to this corrupt and wretched Member of it.</Q>
Other Quotations to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, from the &s;ame Author, are given us by Mr. <HI>White.</HI> He then remarks:
<Q>If this be admitted (as I fancy it will) by my An&s;werer; if he grants that Gentleman (Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI>) that our Lord, on divers Occa&s;ions did &s;peak to the <HI>Twelve</HI> in &s;uch Terms as were, and, which is more, he <HI>knew,</HI> were no Way ap|plicable to the Traitor&mdash;how can he think it wrong, and &s;uch an unwarrantable Thing, as he pretends to do, in the Bi&s;hops, at Con|firmation, to declare, before the whole A&s;&s;em|bly offering them&s;elves to be confirmed, that <HI>God had vouch&s;afed to regenerate tho&s;e his Ser|vants by Water and the Holy Gho&s;t, and to give them the Forgivene&s;s of all their Sins,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>IT might have been not ami&s;s, if the Doctor, who &s;o often flouri&s;hes away with Extracts from the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Gentleman</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peirce,</HI> had care|fully attended to Mr. <HI>White's Defences</HI> again&s;t the Objections of the former, and to Dr. <HI>Grey's</HI> An&s;wer to the latter; in which Ca&s;e, I cannot but think that &s;ome of his Quotations from tho&s;e Authors would have been &s;pared.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<P>THE De&s;ign of the next Section of the <HI>Appeal</HI> was to &s;hew,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. III.</NOTE> by a particular Application of the general Doctrine of Epi&s;copacy,
<Q>that the Church in <HI>America,</HI> without an Epi&s;copate, is nece&s;&s;arily de&s;titute of a regular Government, and cannot enjoy the Benefits of Ordination and Con|firmation.</Q>
This is a natural Con&s;equence of our Principles; and one would think that no Per&s;on would venture to di&s;pute it. But yet Dr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> who &s;eems to have proceeded upon the Plan of di&s;puting every Thing that is advanced in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> has &s;hewn that he is able to offer Objections even to this.</P>
<P>I <HI>pa&s;&s;ed over</HI> the &s;ubject of Confirmation <HI>without Enlargement,</HI> de&s;ignedly; becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;ed, that, with &s;ome of my Readers, the Importance of that &s;acred Rite would not be acknowledged&mdash;or, in the Doctor's Phra&s;cology, that the Subject was <HI>not &s;uited to the Colony-Ta&s;te.</HI> It is not a Matter of Wonder to me, that an In&s;tance of &s;uch Com|plai&s;ance to the Reader, &s;hould be di&s;agreeable to &s;uch an <HI>An&s;werer</HI> as the Doctor; who hints his Di&s;like that the more important Points of Govern|ment and Ordination are, as he &s;ays,
<Q>immediately <HI>proceeded</HI> to,</Q>
making a Participle pa&s;&s;ive from "a Verb neuter&mdash;Liberties of which Kind, I find him frequently taking without Ceremony.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="011203_0110_0F94F9E2C4160D10">BEFORE he enters upon the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Section, he thinks fit to make Two Remarks. The fir&s;t, in p. 56, and running on to p. 59, was occa&s;ioned by my &s;aying, that
<Q>none but Bi&s;hops have a Right to govern the Church:</Q>
Whereupon he repre&s;ents the Church of England as having no Authority that is <HI>purely &s;piritual,</HI> every Thing of that Kind being con&s;idered by him as ab&s;orbed in the King's Supremacy. But this Matter has al|ready been placed in &s;o full and clear a Light, that to enlarge upon it here would be paying but an ill Compliment to the Reader's Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>HIS other Remark in p. 59, which he confe&s;&s;es to be not <HI>e&s;&s;entially important,</HI> relates to the <HI>Dif|ference betwixt the Complaint as made at the Head of this Section,</HI> and its Appearance in the Explanation that follows. <HI>The Ground of the Complaint,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>as there &s;pecified, is this, the Church of England in America, being without Bi&s;hops, mu&s;t for that Rea&s;on</HI> 'be without Government and Ordination:' <HI>Whereas the Ju&s;tification of this Complaint does not proceed upon the &s;uppo&s;ition either that they have</HI> 'no Govern|ment,' <HI>or can have</HI> 'no Ordination;' <HI>but that their Government without Bi&s;hops is incomplete and in&s;uffi|cient, and that Ordination cannot be had without Difficulty, Danger and Expence,</HI> p. 60. By <HI>the Head if the Section,</HI> I &s;hould under&s;tand the <HI>Title</HI> of the Section, or at lea&s;t its fir&s;t Paragraph. But <HI>the Complaint as &s;pecified</HI> in the Title of the Section is, that without an Epi&s;copate the Church in Ame|rica 'is de&s;titute of a <HI>regular</HI> Government;' implying that it might be under a Government that is im|perfect and irregular. If therefore, as the Doctor &s;ays, <HI>the Ju&s;tification of the Complaint proceeds upon the Suppo&s;ition, that without Bi&s;hops the Government
<PB N="101" REF="011203_0111_0F94F9E3585A1D98">
of the Church is incomplete and in&s;ufficient,</HI> it exactly an&s;wers to the Title of the Section. Indeed in p. 27, I had &s;aid that
<Q>the American Church, while without Bi&s;hops, mu&s;t be without Government.</Q>
If he had this general Expre&s;&s;ion in his View, he did wrong in &s;aying it was at the <HI>Head</HI> of the Section; for few of his Readers, I believe, would ever think of looking for the Head of a Thing, in the <HI>Middle</HI> of it.</P>
<P>I TOOK Notice that this general Propo&s;ition,
<Q>that without Bi&s;hops the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>America</HI> is without Government,</Q>
is to be under|&s;tood in a qualified Sen&s;e: But &s;urely there can be no Incon&s;i&s;tency in this. It is very common, and agreeable to &s;trict Method, fir&s;t to lay down a general Propo&s;ition, and then to mark out the Exceptions and Limitations with which it is to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>Ordination,</HI> the general Propo&s;ition is true without any Exception. For without Bi&s;hops, upon the Principles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> 2there cannot be Ordination in a &s;ingle In&s;tance. The Doctor here di&s;tingui&s;hes; <HI>no Ordination, and Ordination with Inconvenience and Charge, are quite different Things.</HI> But he &s;eems to labour under a great Confu&s;ion of Ideas, whenever he talks upon the Subject of Ordination. The Po&s;ition which he controverts is this, that there can be no Ordinati|ons in <HI>America</HI> without Bi&s;hops in <HI>America</HI>; in Oppo&s;ition to which he argues, that we may have Ordinations in <HI>America, with Inconvenience and Charge.</HI> But how can we, without Bi&s;hops, have Ordinations in <HI>America?</HI> Why, &s;ays my very logi|cal Opponent, by having them <HI>in England.</HI> Yet
<PB N="102" REF="011203_0112_0F94F9E413A77E80">
he unluckily acknowledges in p. 56, <HI>as to Confir|mation,</HI> that we <HI>mu&s;t be in Want of it without Bi|&s;hops, becau&s;e they only can perform this Piece of Service.</HI> If &s;o, one would be apt to think, in like Manner, as to <HI>Ordination,</HI> that we mu&s;t be in Want of it without Bi&s;hops, becau&s;e they only can perform this Piece of Service. But no: Or|dination, it &s;eems, may be had &s;till, <HI>with Inconve|nience and Charge</HI>; and &s;o &s;ay I, may Confirma|tion. But the Truth is, neither of them can be had in <HI>America,</HI> otherwi&s;e than by having them in <HI>Europe.</HI> Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for an Illu&s;tration, that the civil Authority &s;hould put a Stop to every Printing-Pre&s;s in <HI>England</HI>; and that &s;ome Per&s;on &s;hould complain of the Hard&s;hip of this, that &s;o con&s;titutional a Right as the Liberty of the Pre&s;s &s;hould be refu&s;ed to Engli&s;hmen: Would not an Objector appear in a ridiculous Light, that &s;hould affirm the Liberty of the Pre&s;s was not refu&s;ed, but only attended <HI>with Inconvenience and Charge</HI>; and explain him&s;elf by &s;aying that a Man might go to <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and there find a Pre&s;s that would &s;erve him? And yet I cannot conceive that it makes any material Difference, whether the Subject of &s;uch rea&s;oning be Ordination, or the Liberty of the Pre&s;s.</P>
<P>UNDER the Head of <HI>Government,</HI> I attempted to &s;hew, that although Pre&s;byters may have a &s;ubor|dinate Authority, yet unalienable epi&s;copal Au|thority was moreover nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer the Ends of Government in an epi&s;copal Church &mdash;and that the Church of <HI>England</HI> in the Co|lonies greatly &s;uffers for Want of this Authority. The Doctor's Remark is, that if Pre&s;byters may have a &s;ubordinate Authority, <HI>the Church is &s;till in
<PB N="103" REF="011203_0113_0F94F9E4A317CB90">
a le&s;s deplorable State than was repre&s;ented by the Complaint, as at fir&s;t worded.</HI> How the Complaint was <HI>at fir&s;t worded,</HI> has been &s;hewn; but if the State of the Church here is not &s;o deplorably bad, with Re&s;pect to its Government, as if Pre&s;byters could have no &s;ubordinate Authority at all; yet that is no Rea&s;on why we &s;hould not endeavour to make it better than it is, nor is it any Rea&s;on why others &s;hould oppo&s;e the Attempt.</P>
<P>THE Doctor affects to think the Matter would not be much mended, by the Re&s;idence of Bi&s;hops. <HI>The Church at Home,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is in this Re&s;pect, in as lamentable a State as the Church in</HI> America. <HI>The Liturgy it&s;elf &s;uppo&s;es their Di&s;cipline to be in a wretched Condition,</HI> p. 62&mdash;alluding, I imagine, to the Commination-Office. That the Di&s;cipline of the Church of <HI>England</HI> is defective in &s;ome Re&s;|pects, and below the primitive Standard, She has the Candor to confe&s;s: If others, who&s;e Di&s;cipline is by no Means more perfect, would confe&s;s the &s;ame, it would be much for their Credit. But the Want of primitive Di&s;cipline in the Church at Home, is no Proof that the Want of it is not &s;till greater in the Colonies, nor that the Want cannot in &s;ome Degree be remedied by the propo&s;ed Epi&s;|copate. We think that a &s;trict Di&s;cipline, with Regard to the American Clergy, might be exer|ci&s;ed under an Epi&s;copate. This is certainly ex|pected; it is an important Part of our Plan; and that American Bi&s;hops would di&s;appoint us in this Re&s;pect, none have a Right to declare, until the Experiment &s;hall have been made.</P>
<P>TO &s;hew that the&s;e Expectations are vain, <HI>the learned Dr. Whitby</HI> is quoted for the&s;e Words: "the Church of <HI>England</HI> ob&s;erves no Di&s;cipline."
<PB N="104" REF="011203_0114_0F94F9E9AF3CD988">
But if it be true, that the Church ob&s;erves no Di&s;cipline at Home, it will not follow, that, in very different Circum&s;tances, She will not exerci&s;e the Di&s;cipline here which is propo&s;ed and expected, when Bi&s;hops &s;hall be appointed to re&s;ide in <HI>Ame|rica.</HI> But is the Doctor certain, that the learned Commentator &s;ays what he a&s;cribes to him? I a&s;k the Que&s;tion, not only becau&s;e <HI>Whitby</HI> mentions not "the Church of <HI>England</HI>" in the Pa&s;&s;age refered to, but becau&s;e it appears to me, that what is there &s;aid of a Church without Di&s;cipline, the Commentator &s;ays not in his own Per&s;on, but in the Character of a Di&s;&s;enter, who is introduced as a&s;&s;igning it for a Rea&s;on of his Separation from the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Whether I am right in this Opinion, let the Reader judge. After men|tioning the Ca&s;e of a Jew, who was governed by an erroneous Con&s;cience, Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> ob&s;erves:
<Q>this is &s;o far from being an unparallel Ca&s;e, that it is the very Ca&s;e of the <HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> u&s;ing &s;till the anointing of the &s;ick&mdash;of the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts,</HI> dipping them that are baptized&mdash;of the <HI>Greek Church,</HI> refu&s;ing to eat Things &s;trangled and Blood, out of a Reverence to the apo&s;tolical In|junction&mdash;of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> u&s;ing Prayer by the Spirit, or conceived Prayer, out of Reverence to the Command, <HI>to pray in the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and ab&s;taining from Communion with <HI>that Church which ob&s;erves no Church Di&s;cipline,</HI> out of Re&s;|pect to the Command, to purge the evil from among us; for all this is done by them out of a <HI>mi&s;taken</HI> Reverence to a divine Authority, which they conceive obliging to them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Note on <HI>Rom.</HI> XIV.6.</NOTE>.</Q>
Now what is here probably, at lea&s;t very po&s;&s;ibly, in|tended
<PB N="105" REF="011203_0115_0F94F9F25764CCD0">
only to expre&s;s a Conceit of the Di&s;&s;en|ters, the Doctor, by a Stretch of his Preroga|tive, after making the nece&s;&s;ary Corrections and Amendments, forms into a po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertion, and puts it into the Mouth of Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> giving it all the Marks of a literal Quotation. Yet after all, &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Whitby</HI> had taken it into his Head to a&s;&s;ert, what the Doctor, or rather Mr. <HI>Peirce,</HI> from whom the Quotation appears to have been taken, makes him to a&s;&s;ert; it will only follow, that he a&s;&s;erted of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> what is not true of that, or any other Church in the Univer&s;e. For there is no Church but has &s;ome Canons and Laws to regulate the Behaviour of its Members, and &s;ometimes, at lea&s;t, puts them in Execution; and in &s;o doing, ob&s;erves and exerci&s;es Di&s;cipline. Un|le&s;s therefore it can be proved, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> has no Laws, or that none of her Laws are ever inforced, it cannot ju&s;tly be a&s;&s;erted that She ob&s;erves <HI>no</HI> Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>IN explaining the Nature of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Au|thority, I had advanced this Propo&s;ition,
<Q>the Power of the Church is of a &s;piritual Nature.</Q>
The Truth of this is admited by Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>; but then he immediately rou&s;es him&s;elf and his Readers with the following Exclamation. <HI>It is really a&s;to|ni&s;hing, that he</HI> (the Author of the <HI>Appeal) &s;hould make &s;piritual Cen&s;ures the utmo&s;t Effect of the Power of the Church of England!</HI> And it is equal|ly <HI>a&s;toni&s;hing</HI> to me, that he &s;hould not &s;ee, that, in the Place refered to, I was con&s;idering the Church in its original State, before it was taken under the Protection of the civil Power. I was not &s;peaking of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in its pre&s;ent Situation, &s;upported and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Laws of the King|dom;
<PB N="106" REF="011203_0116_0F94F9F28C2004E8">
nor of any other Church, in &s;imilar Cir|cum&s;tances. All Churches, whether Epi&s;copalian or Pre&s;byterian, which enjoy the Benefit of a civil E&s;tabli&s;hment, have their Decrees &s;econded and inforced, in &s;ome In&s;tances, by the &s;ecular Arm. And if the Church of <HI>England</HI> rejects not the friendly A&s;&s;i&s;tance of temporal Authority; neither does the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor that of <HI>Geneva,</HI> nor any other, to whom it is offered. This Ob&s;er|vation I beg Leave to illu&s;trate and confirm by an Example from <HI>Geneva,</HI> which was produced in the Conference at <HI>Hampton-Court.</HI>
<Q>One <HI>Baltha&s;ar,</HI> a rich Widow in <HI>Geneva,</HI> had a <HI>Ball</HI> in her Hou&s;e. This Diver&s;ion is a great Crime by <HI>Calvin</HI>'s Di&s;cipline. It happened that a <HI>Syndick,</HI> one of the Four chief Magi&s;trates, and one <HI>Henrick</HI> an <HI>Elder,</HI> were Two of tho&s;e that danced. When <HI>Calvin</HI> under&s;tood what was done, he convented them before a Con&s;i&s;tory; and tho' they were delated by no Body, the Oath <HI>ex Offi|cio</HI> was put to them to extort Matter of Fact.&mdash; In &s;hort, <HI>Henrick</HI> the Elder&mdash;was turned out of his Office, and <HI>impri&s;oned</HI> for three Days. The <HI>Syndick</HI> was likewi&s;e &s;u&s;pended from the Execu|tion of his Office, 'till he had given &s;ome Proofs of his Repentance for being at the Ball. This Man re&s;igned to the Con&s;i&s;tory, did Penance upon their Admonition, and &s;o prevented his Commitment. There were &s;everal others, who being examined by <HI>Calvin</HI> upon their Oath, con|fe&s;&s;ed they were at this dancing Entertainment, upon which they were all &s;ent to Pri&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Collier</HI>'s Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, Vol. II. p. 602.</NOTE>.</Q>
We &s;ee here that <HI>Calvin</HI> &s;crupled not to make U&s;e of that temporal Power granted him by the Repub|lic, but would <HI>depo&s;e</HI> and <HI>impri&s;on</HI> Men, as he

thought it would be&s;t an&s;wer the Purpo&s;es of his Di&s;cipline. And now, before I return from <HI>Gene|va,</HI> I will only ob&s;erve, that the temporal Effects of Excommunication there, are as dreadful, as the Doctor, in the Words of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Gentleman,</HI> has repre&s;ented them to be in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>IN &s;peaking of Excommunication and eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Cen&s;ures, I had ob&s;erved, that in this Age they have lo&s;t much of their Weight; which is owing to certain Cau&s;es that were briefly intimated. The Doctor bri&s;kly replies, <HI>it is readily acknow|ledged the Di&s;cipline of the Church is held in Con|tempt by Multitudes.</HI> But &s;urely he mu&s;t know, that Men may de&s;pi&s;e Things that are not in them|&s;elves contemptible, and that they may <HI>affect</HI> to de&s;|pi&s;e Things, at the &s;ame Time that they really look upon them to be venerable. I have met with Per|&s;ons who appeared to hold the Di&s;cipline exerci&s;ed by <HI>the Churches in the Colonies</HI> in as great Contempt, as the Doctor, or any of his Party, can hold that of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> If <HI>Infidels and Liber|tines laugh to &s;ee how it is exerci&s;ed</HI>; we may, in a great Mea&s;ure, thank tho&s;e, who have taken &s;o much ungenerous Pains to repre&s;ent it in a ridicu|lous Light.</P>
<P><HI>IT would be a Shame,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>for a Man to &s;peak in its Defence.</HI> We acknowledge the Di&s;cipline of the Church to be defective, and &s;o far we undertake not to defend it:&mdash;I wi&s;h &s;ome others had the &s;ame Ingenuity. But although we pretend not to <HI>defend</HI> it in every Re&s;pect, yet much may be &s;aid, and has been often &s;aid, to <HI>excu&s;e</HI> it. The Doctor takes for granted that no <HI>Attempt for Redre&s;s</HI> has been ever made. But in this he a&s;&s;umes
<PB N="108" REF="011203_0118_0F94F9F50937A650">
more, than we choo&s;e to allow him. He mu&s;t be a Stranger to our Hi&s;tory, who knows not that &s;ome Attempts have been made with this View; and there may have been &s;ome &s;ecret ones, of which Hi&s;tory does not inform us. Does he think that nothing can be attempted, without public Noi&s;e and Clamour? Or, is it rea&s;onable to be noi&s;y and clamorous, when it is known that it can an&s;wer no valuable Purpo&s;e? May not an indi&s;creet Zeal, in this, as well as in other Ca&s;es, do more Mi&s;chief than Service? We are not a&s;hamed to confe&s;s, that we wi&s;h for the farther Improvement of every Thing belonging to the Church; of our Di&s;ci|pline, of our common Tran&s;lation of the Bible, of our Liturgy and public Offices; which we hope in due Time to obtain, in a regular and peaceable Way; until which Time we &s;hall continue to U&s;e them in their pre&s;ent State:&mdash;Looking upon the Di&s;cipline of the Church, defective as it is, to be equal with that of our Neighbours&mdash;con&s;idering our Tran&s;lation of the Bible, however erroneous in in &s;ome particular Pa&s;&s;ages, as tolerable upon the whole&mdash;and e&s;teeming our Liturgy, although ca|pable of &s;till farther Improvement, to be the be&s;t upon Earth.</P>

run away with his Rea&s;on; and that his whole Repre&s;entation is manife&s;tly &s;o uncandid, &s;o par|tial, &s;o hyperbolical, &s;o ranting, and, I may add, &s;o impertinent to his proper Bu&s;ine&s;s, that it merits a Rebuke, rather than a Refutation. If he &s;hould ever again undertake to give the Character of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or of her Clergy; I recom|mend it to him &s;eriou&s;ly to attend to the Apo&s;tle's Direction:
<Q>Let all Bitterne&s;s, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, and Evil-&s;peaking, be put away from you, with all Malice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eph.</HI> iv.31.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>IN p. 69, I am charged with Incon&s;i&s;tency, and the Charge is thus &s;upported. I had &s;aid;
<Q>In this State of Things, the Re&s;toration of the pri|mitive Di&s;cipline &s;eems to be a Matter rather to be wi&s;hed for and de&s;ired, than to be <HI>rationally attempted</HI> by tho&s;e in Authority.</Q>
<HI>And yet,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>it is propo&s;ed, that this very Thing which cannot</HI> RATIONALLY BE ATTEMPTED, <HI>&s;hould not only be attempted, but carried into Effect.</HI> The Thing that in our Opinion, cannot rationally be attempted, is the Re&s;toration of the <HI>primitive</HI> Di&s;ci|pline; the Thing therefore <HI>propo&s;ed,</HI> according to this Repre&s;entation, is not only to <HI>attempt,</HI> but to <HI>carry into Effect</HI> (as indeed mo&s;t Attempts are propo&s;ed with a View of carrying Something into Effect) the Re&s;toration of the <HI>primitive</HI> Di&s;cipline. And yet, notwith&s;tanding that we are allowed to have propo&s;ed this, we are in the very &s;ame Page blamed for <HI>not</HI> propo&s;ing it&mdash;for forming a Plan not adapt|ed to <HI>the Go&s;pel-In&s;titution of Di&s;cipline,</HI> which we all know was the <HI>primitive</HI> Standard. The Ta&s;k, I own, is &s;omewhat difficult, to ju&s;tify our&s;elves for propo&s;ing and not propo&s;ing, for attempting
<PB N="110" REF="011203_0120_0F94F9F6901D4E20">
and not attempting, the &s;ame Thing; and it is rather unkindly impo&s;ed upon us. But if we might be allowed to proceed in our own Way, we believe we could &s;atisfy all rea&s;onable Per&s;ons. Our Opi|nion is, that in the pre&s;ent State of Things, the Re&s;toration of the primitive Di&s;cipline cannot be attempted, with any Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s. If the Doctor thinks otherwi&s;e, let him try the Expe|riment with his own Congregation, which I &s;up|po&s;e to be not more than commonly intractable; and when the <HI>Attempt</HI> is fairly <HI>carried into Effect,</HI> if he will publi&s;h a Narrative of his Proce&s;s, &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful an Example may animate and direct o|thers; and then, if they refu&s;e to follow it, he may blame them with a better Grace. We are farther of Opinion, that although it is proper and advi&s;eable, for many Rea&s;ons, to leave the Di&s;ci|pline of the <HI>American</HI> Church, &s;o far as it relates to the Laity, in its pre&s;ent State; yet, that it is nece&s;&s;ary, and at the &s;ame Time very practicable, with the Advantage of an Epi&s;copate, to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;trict Di&s;cipline over the Clergy; and therefore it is intended that
<Q>the Bi&s;hop's Power over them &s;hall be as full and compleat, as the Laws and Canons of the Church direct.</Q></P>
<P>BUT, <HI>is not godly Di&s;cipline as needful for the Laity as the Clergy?</HI> Some godly Di&s;cipline for the Laity we already have; we can repel from the Communion tho&s;e whom we di&s;cover to come with an unworthy Di&s;po&s;ition; and, in this Country in particular, we DARE to repel, any <HI>Bla&s;phemer the three Kingdoms afford,</HI> even <HI>when he comes to demand it as a Qualification for an Office in the Ar|my or Fleet.</HI> Other Acts of Di&s;cipline we are able to exerci&s;e over the Laity; and, con&s;idering the
<PB N="111" REF="011203_0121_0F94F9F7677F57E8">
Provi&s;ion made by our Laws for the Puni&s;hment of many of tho&s;e Crimes, which in the primitive Ages had no other Re&s;traint than the Di&s;cipline of the Church, any farther Exertion of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority over the Laity, is perhaps rendered le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary. The&s;e Sentiments are not contradicted in the <HI>Appeal</HI>; for therein I did not <HI>make it one main Article of my Complaint, that</HI>
<Q>the People, being &s;en&s;ible of the Clergy's Want of Power, find them&s;elves free from all Re&s;traints of eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Authority;</Q>
I only repre&s;ented this as being in Reality the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>BISHOPS</HI> undoubtedly, <HI>as Succe&s;&s;ors to the A|po&s;tles, are as much ve&s;ted with Authority to govern the Laity as the Clergy</HI>; but, after the Example of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> they may think them&s;elves not obliged to exerci&s;e it with Severity, &s;ince it is given them "to Edification, and not to De&s;truction<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii.10.</NOTE>." If therefore they &s;hould judge any Plan, for a greater Exten&s;ion, or a more vigorous Exertion, of eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Power over the <HI>American</HI> Laity, would tend more to <HI>De&s;truction</HI> than to <HI>Edification,</HI> they are warranted to reject it; and if they have a Right to reject it, they may give A&s;&s;urances of &s;uch a Rejection. But does not this Di&s;tinction imply that <HI>the Church-Clergy are much wor&s;e than the Laity?</HI> All that I can conceive to be implied in it is, that greater Advantages are expected from increa&s;ing the Re&s;traints of the Clergy, than of the Laity; or, at lea&s;t, that in the Ca&s;e of the Clergy, it is more practicable.</P>
<P>The long Extract from Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet,</HI> begin|ning p. 70, &s;hews that the Bi&s;hop, at the Time

of writing it, thought there were many Things in the Church that wanted Amendment; and if he had undertaken, with the &s;ame Freedom, to give his Opinion of the Di&s;&s;enters, he would probably have pre&s;ented us with a no le&s;s dark and gloomy De|&s;cription. The Quotation from Mr. <HI>Peirce,</HI> about the Right of Patronage, is as foreign from the Doctor's Bu&s;ine&s;s, as an Argument would be about the Colour of <HI>Aaron's Linen Ephod.</HI> Therefore pa&s;&s;ing over this, and, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on the Quotation from Dr. <HI>Croft</HI>'s <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Crofts</HI> was an&s;wered by Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet,</HI> in

<P>WHETHER we are right or wrong in that Part of our Plan which relates to the <HI>Laity,</HI> it might be expected that a Propo&s;al for bringing the <HI>Clergy</HI> under a &s;trict Di&s;cipline, would meet with no Ob|jections from tho&s;e, who frequently reproach us with the Want of it. For certainly it is better that &s;ome Part of any Society &s;hould be duly governed, than that no Part &s;hould. But we are &s;o unlucky as to be oppo&s;ed, as well in our Scheme for exer|ci&s;ing Di&s;cipline over the Clergy, as for not exer|ci&s;ing it with more Severity over the Laity.</P>
<P>IN p. 75 and 77, the Doctor thinks to incum|ber us with this Objection, that our Plan for the Government of the Clergy cannot be executed in the Manner we propo&s;e, <HI>unle&s;s the e&s;tabli&s;hed Mode
<PB N="113" REF="011203_0123_0F94F9FD90A43930">
of Di&s;cipline &s;hould be &s;o changed, as to be quite dif|ferent from what it is in England.</HI> I am glad to &s;ee it granted that the Church of <HI>England</HI> has an e&s;tabli&s;hed Mode of Di&s;cipline, &s;o &s;oon after a De|nial that She has any Di&s;cipline at all. It &s;hews that the Doctor is not incapable of &s;eeing and re|tracting his Errors. But as to the <HI>Mode</HI> of our Di&s;cipline, he need not give him&s;elf any Concern on that Account. It has always been intended, that the Mode of it here, under an Epi&s;copate, &s;hall be different from what it is in <HI>England.</HI> The E&s;&s;en|tials will be the &s;ame, but the Manner of Admi|ni&s;tration will differ, in many Re&s;pects. The Bi|&s;hop's Authority here, will be purely Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal; but at Home, temporal Power, a Non-E&s;|&s;ential, is joined with it. <HI>There,</HI> many tedious Forms mu&s;t be attended to and ob&s;erved; but <HI>here,</HI> every Thing may be done in a more &s;ummary Way, and no farther Delay will be nece&s;&s;ary, than what will be required for a due Information, con|cerning the Facts upon which Camplaints &s;hall be founded.</P>
<P><HI>BUT,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, p. 77, <HI>if an Alteration is to be made,</HI> in the <HI>Mode</HI> of exerci&s;ing Di&s;cipline, <HI>it is infinitely rea&s;onable, it &s;hould fir&s;t take Place at Home, where it is mo&s;t needed. When it is effected there, it will be Time enough to de&s;ire it here.</HI> All Changes of ancient and e&s;tabli&s;hed U&s;ages in any Country, are found to be extremely difficult; and the Doctor &s;eems not to be aware, how many Laws mu&s;t be repealed before &s;uch a Plan of Di&s;cipline, as may be ea&s;ily <HI>carried into Effect</HI> here, can be executed in <HI>England</HI>&mdash;nor how nearly, &s;uch an Al|teration may be thought to affect the State. The whole Sy&s;tem of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Laws mu&s;t be new-modeled,
<PB N="114" REF="011203_0124_0F94F9FED5058BC8">
and one half of the national Con&s;tituti|on mu&s;t undergo a very con&s;iderable Change, in Order to which, not only the Bi&s;hops and Clergy, but all the Branches of the Legi&s;lature, mu&s;t be convinced of the Utility and SAFETY of the Mea|&s;ure&mdash;before this Propo&s;al can take Place in <HI>En|gland.</HI> But at the fir&s;t Settlement of an Epi&s;co|pate in the Colonies, the propo&s;ed Alteration of the e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>Mode</HI> may be introduced, without any &s;uch Difficulties, and even with as much Ea&s;e as the Mode that is practi&s;ed at Home can be intro|duced. There is therefore no Rea&s;on at all for waiting to &s;ee it effected <HI>there,</HI> before we <HI>de&s;ire it here</HI>; much le&s;s is it <HI>infinitely rea&s;onable</HI> to do &s;o. If the propo&s;ed Mode is eligible in it&s;elf, and may ea&s;ily be obtained by us, why &s;hould we wait for tho&s;e who cannot ea&s;ily obtain it, to &s;et us the Ex|ample?</P>
<P>IN &s;peaking of the Clergy under the Di&s;tinction of the Virtuous and the Vicious, it was ob&s;erved in the <HI>Appeal</HI> p. 32, that
<Q>the Want of Bi&s;hops to &s;uperintend and govern them, is obvious at fir&s;t View. If one Sort have no need of a Bi&s;hop to keep them to their Duty, yet &s;ome Ca&s;es will ari&s;e in the Di&s;charge of it, in which his Directi|on will be u&s;eful&mdash;and many Ca&s;es, wherein his Support and Encouragement will be needful&mdash; and in all Ca&s;es, his Friend&s;hip and Patronage will give Life and Spirit to them in undergoing the Difficulties, and performing the Duties of their Stations.</Q>
Upon this Pa&s;&s;age Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> makes the following Animadver&s;ion. <HI>But what is all this to the Affair of Di&s;cipline, the grand Point in View? The Doctor's Bu&s;ine&s;s here was, to &s;hew it to be nece&s;&s;ary that &s;trict Di&s;cipline &s;hould be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB N="115" REF="011203_0125_0F94F9FF866B2870">
with Re&s;pect to the Clergy; and he begins his Argument with a Ca&s;e, wherein it is not needed at all,</HI> p. 76. I have no Objections to being re|minded of my proper <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> when I happen to forget, or mi&s;take it; nor to being called to Order, when I wander from <HI>the grand Point in View.</HI> I can take &s;uch Interpo&s;itions kindly, even from Dr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> although he has forfeited all Right to interpo&s;e in this Manner, by his own frequent Aberrations from the <HI>Point in View.</HI> I would only re&s;erve to my&s;elf the Privilege of being con|vinced of my Error, before I retract it; which in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e I am not. If a Per&s;on were &s;peak|ing of the Nece&s;&s;ity and Advantages of <HI>civil</HI> Go|vernment; it would be natural for him, and not <HI>impertinent,</HI> to make &s;uch Ob&s;ervations as the&s;e: That Subjects may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into the Virtu|ous, and the Vicious&mdash;that, although Government is more immediately nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train the Lat|ter, it will al&s;o have a good Effect upon the For|mer&mdash;not indeed in the &s;ame Way, but by the Ap|probation, Encouragement and Direction they will, in general, receive from their Superiors; and by this means Benefit will redound to all with whom they are connected. Now as Di&s;cipline in the Church an&s;wers to Government in the State, I &s;ee not why the &s;ame Method of Illu&s;tration may not be equally proper in both Ca&s;es; nor why the Sen|tence here quoted from the <HI>Appeal,</HI> may not be <HI>pertinent to the propo&s;ed Subject in Debate.</HI> If the Word <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> indeed included only the Idea of Puni&s;hment, the Animadver&s;ion would be ju&s;t; but &s;ince, upon the Authority of the be&s;t Wri|ters, it may be extended to Government in gene|ral, in which large Sen&s;e I manife&s;tly u&s;ed it, it is hyper-critical.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="011203_0126_0F94FA0048F44450">BUT, it &s;eems, the Advantages expected from an Epi&s;copate are chiefly <HI>imaginary.</HI> For <HI>was there now a Bi&s;hop in whatever Part of America he would choo&s;e, the Clergy would notwith&s;tanding be variou&s;ly di&s;tant from him &s;ome Hundreds of Miles; in&s;omuch that but few of them could reap much Benefit either by his Direction, Encouragement or Patronage.</HI> I am glad to find it allowed that &s;ome <HI>few of them</HI> may be near him, and <HI>reap</HI> the Advantages propo&s;ed. I hope al&s;o that <HI>&s;ome Hundreds of Miles</HI> will be found, upon the Trial, not to be equal to &s;ome <HI>Thou&s;ands.</HI> If <HI>all</HI> the Clergy were to be kept at the Di&s;tance of &s;ome Hundreds of Miles, and were to have no Intercour&s;e or Corre&s;pendence with the Bi&s;hop, the Advantages expected would be truly chimerical; but according to our Plan, there will not be a Clergyman within his Juri&s;diction, but mu&s;t be per&s;onally acquainted and maintain an In|tercour&s;e, with him, in a greater or le&s;s Degree.</P>
<P>AS to the Effects of the propo&s;ed Di&s;cipline upon vicious Clergymen, it is argued in p. 77, that they are not to be expected here, becau&s;e it is ob|&s;erved that <HI>Multitudes</HI> of Clergymen e&s;cape Pu|ni&s;hment at Home. The Doctor's <HI>Multitudes</HI> may perhaps, with more Propriety, be called <HI>&s;ome</HI>; and that &s;ome &s;hould e&s;cape, that de&s;erve, Puni&s;h|ment, where the Number of Clergymen amounts to twelve Thou&s;and, is not to be wondered at. Are there not &s;ome In&s;tances of this Kind, under the Pre&s;byterian Di&s;cipline? Have there not been &s;ome, even in <HI>New-England?</HI> But &s;uppo&s;ing the Number to be greater in Proportion in <HI>England,</HI> than in <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>New-England</HI>; it may be owing to o|ther Cau&s;es, than the comparative In&s;ufficiency of epi&s;copal Government, or the Inattention of the
<PB N="117" REF="011203_0127_0F94FA015F0807E0">
Bi&s;hops. There are in <HI>England</HI> &s;ome Places that are exempted from the Bi&s;hop's Juri&s;diction; and it is greatly owing to the Refuge and Protection which tho&s;e Places afford, that &s;ome vicious Cler|gymen e&s;cape Puni&s;hment. But the Ca&s;e of the Clergy here, will always be different from what it is in <HI>England</HI> in &s;o many Re&s;pects, that it can never be ju&s;tly argued that the Bi&s;hop's Power over them will be ineffectual here, from any Failure of it there. It is po&s;&s;ible that we may be too &s;anguine in our Expectations; but if an Epi&s;copate will produce one half of the good Effects which we ex|pect from it, it mu&s;t be very de&s;irable; and we cannot but look upon every Attempt to defeat the Mea&s;ures taken to obtain it, as ungenerous and unchri&s;tian.</P>
<P>AS to all the Purpo&s;es of Government, the Doc|tor thinks they might be as well an&s;wered by <HI>Com|mi&s;&s;aries</HI>; but both Rea&s;on and Experience teach the contrary. Some Branches of the epi&s;copal Au|thority cannot be communicated to Commi&s;&s;aries; and where it is otherwi&s;e, Power in the Hands of a Delegate of an inferior Rank, has never that Weight and good Effect, as when exerci&s;ed by the Principal. For the&s;e and other Rea&s;ons, when Trial was formerly made of <HI>American</HI> Commi&s;&s;ari|es, they were found by no Means to an&s;wer the Purpo&s;es of their Appointment.</P>
<P>THE Public has been a&s;&s;ured, from Time to Time, that none of tho&s;e <HI>Spiritual Courts,</HI> again&s;t which there is &s;o general a Prejudice, will be con|nected with an <HI>American</HI> Epi&s;copate. Some have pretended to &s;u&s;pect, that our real Intentions are different from our Profe&s;&s;ions; and Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="011203_0128_0F94FA07F526A0E0">
thinks he has at la&s;t detected us. For he has &s;a|gaciou&s;ly di&s;covered, that if an immoral Clergy|man is to be <HI>tried</HI> and condemned, there mu&s;t be <HI>Courts</HI> for his Trial and Condemnation. <HI>Where,</HI> &s;ays he p. 78, <HI>is the Ca&s;e to be tried? Can it be tried any where, conformably to the Mode of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Church, but in a</HI> SPIRITUAL COURT? We are under no peculiar Attachment to the <HI>Mode</HI> of Practice in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts at Home, nor will <HI>American</HI> Bi&s;hops be obliged to follow it. And as to &s;uch Courts as may be erected in this Coun|try, for the Trial of the epi&s;copal Clergy ONLY, the Doctor, I again &s;ay, need give him&s;elf no Concern about them, unle&s;s he expects to become an epi&s;copal Clergyman him&s;elf. For none have Rea&s;on to object again&s;t Things, but upon the Suppo&s;ition that they are to be, in &s;ome Manner, affected by them. The <HI>popular</HI> Objection again&s;t <HI>&s;piritual Courts,</HI> is altogether founded on the Opi|nion of their being injurious, not to the Clergy, but to the <HI>Laity</HI>; but where &s;piritual Courts take no Cognizance at all of the Actions of the Laity, as it is intended that they never &s;hall in <HI>America,</HI> this Objection vani&s;hes.</P>
<P><HI>IT is ob&s;erved,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>that</HI>
<Q>the Cler|gy's being under the Eye of their Bi&s;hop will naturally tend to make them, in general, more regular and diligent in the Di&s;charge of the Du|ties of their office.</Q>
And what Objection can he make to this? Why, <HI>if their being under the Eye of the omnipre&s;ent, omni&s;cient God, will not make them regular and diligent, it is a vain Thing to expect that their being under</HI> 'the Eye of the Bi&s;hop' <HI>&s;hould do it.</HI> And with equal Truth and Propri|ety he might have &s;aid, of all but Athei&s;ts, that
<PB N="119" REF="011203_0129_0F94FA082329C908">
<HI>if their being under the Eye of the omnipre&s;ent, om|ni&s;cient God,</HI> will not re&s;train Men from the Crimes of Fraud and Inju&s;tice, <HI>it is a vain Thing to expect that their being under the Eye</HI> of the civil Magi&s;|trate <HI>&s;hould do it.</HI> That the perpetual Pre&s;ence and In&s;pection of the Supreme Being <HI>ought</HI> to have a greater Effect upon Men, than the Pre&s;ence of any earthly Superior, I freely allow; but that it does not actually produce this Effect, in innumer|able In&s;tances, is a melancholy Truth, and upon one Moment's Recollection, the Doctor mu&s;t con|fe&s;s it. What then is to be done? Mu&s;t Men be left to do "what is right in their own Eyes," becau&s;e they will not con&s;ider them&s;elves as <HI>under the Eye of the omnipre&s;ent, omni&s;cient God?</HI> Ought Criminals to go unpuni&s;hed, becau&s;e they will not govern them&s;elves by the great Motives of Religion? Or where the&s;e are ineffectual, is it impo&s;&s;ible that Men &s;hould be governed by Motives of a temporal Nature; or can it con&s;i&s;t with public Wi&s;dom and the Safety of Society, that &s;uch Per&s;ons &s;hould not be re&s;trained by human Laws? According to this Scheme of Politicks, it is unrea&s;onable to expect any Benefit, either from Di&s;cipline in the Church, or from Government in the State.</P>
<P>FARTHER Exception is taken at the Expre&s;&s;ion, that the <HI>American</HI> Clergy will be <HI>under the Eye</HI> of their future Bi&s;hop, as highly figurative. But fi|gurative as it is, it may be ju&s;tified by common U&s;age. To &s;ay of a Clergyman who is even in the immediate Pre&s;ence of his Bi&s;hop, that he is under his Eye, is a figurative Expre&s;&s;ion; and is never, I believe, under&s;tood in a &s;trict literal Sen&s;e. To be under the Eye of a Superior, in common Language &s;ignifies, to be within the Compa&s;s of
<PB N="120" REF="011203_0130_0F94FA09567995F8">
his Ob&s;ervation and Notice. And this will, in &s;ome Degree, be the Ca&s;e of every <HI>American</HI> Clergyman, under the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate. Allowing that a Number of them will be <HI>fixed in Cures, &s;ome Fifty, &s;ome a Hundred, and &s;ome two or three Hundred Miles</HI> from the Place of the Bi&s;hop's Re&s;idence; yet by Means of Vi&s;itations, and a free Corre&s;pondence, nothing very material can ari&s;e in a Clergyman's Situation or Conduct, without the Bi&s;hop's having early Notice of it:&mdash;Very early, in Compari&s;on with what it would be, if he were at the Di&s;tance of a Thou&s;and Leagues.</P>
<P>WHAT follows upon the Subject of Di&s;cipline, is either of no Con&s;equence, or has been an&s;wered already: I &s;hall therefore now attend upon the Doctor, in his Objections to what was advanced, under the Head of <HI>Ordination.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG the Di&s;advantages, to which the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>America</HI> is &s;ubject, for Want of Ordination, the Danger of cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> for the Purpo&s;e of obtaining Holy Orders, was re|pre&s;ented as worthy of Attention. For an Illu&s;tra|tion of this Point, the following Fact was related.
<Q>The exact Number of tho&s;e that have gone Home for Ordination, from the&s;e northern Colonies, is Fifty-two. Of the&s;e Forty-two have returned &s;afely, and Ten have mi&s;carried; the Voyage or Sickne&s;s <HI>occa&s;ioned by it,</HI> having proved fatal to near a fifth Part of them.</Q>
The Doctor replies; <HI>I have never heard of more than Two to whom the Sea proved fatal. If Eight more lo&s;t their Lives by Sickne&s;s, it is no more than they might have done if they had tarried at Home,</HI> p. 81. If he knows but of Two, to whom the Sea proved fatal, I can tell
<PB N="121" REF="011203_0131_0F94FA0A0AEC2480">
him of &s;everal. Within a Year of the Time of writing the <HI>Appeal,</HI> Two peri&s;hed in one Ship upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> almo&s;t in Sight of their Port; one of whom left a Wife and Family of &s;mall Children in <HI>New-York,</HI> without any other Means of Support, than the charitable A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Chri&s;tian Neighbours. As to tho&s;e that lo&s;t their Lives by Sickne&s;s, it is true, <HI>they might have</HI> died <HI>if they had tarried at Home</HI>; as tho&s;e who pe|ri&s;hed at Sea might have been <HI>drowned</HI> at Home in fre&s;h Water. But the A&s;&s;ertion is, not that they died abroad; but that they died of
<Q>Sickne&s;s oc|ca&s;ioned by the Voyage,</Q>
&mdash;<HI>i. e.</HI> of Sickne&s;s, to which, in all Probability, they would not have been expo&s;ed, were it not for the Voyage. And this is &s;trictly true of them in every In&s;tance. Per|haps the Doctor may not think much of our Can|didates dying of contagious Di&s;orders, &s;ince &s;uch are no more than what are called natural Deaths, and all mu&s;t die &s;ooner or later. If he can be of this Opinion after recollecting, that &s;uch Per&s;ons have been taken off in the <HI>Prime</HI> of Life&mdash;ju&s;t as they were entring into public Stations, in which they flattered them&s;elves that they &s;hould be u&s;eful to the World&mdash;that they died in a foreign Land, at a Di&s;tance from their deare&s;t Friends and Connec|tions&mdash;I will not di&s;pute it with him. But what does he think, of our Candidates being carried into Captivity&mdash;thrown into noi&s;ome Pri&s;ons in an Ene|my's Country&mdash;and there langui&s;hing, for many Months, under the mo&s;t hideous Forms of Di&s;tre&s;s and Wretchedne&s;s? Even this has happened in &s;e|veral In&s;tances, and may happen again.</P>
<P><HI>BUT be the Danger great or &s;mall, &s;ays he, there is good Rea&s;on to believe, the going to England for
<PB N="122" REF="011203_0132_0F94FA0AC9B64848">
Ordination is rather an Advantage, than Di&s;advan|tage to the Church in Regard to its being &s;upplied with Mini&s;ters.</HI> If going to <HI>England</HI> for Ordinati|on, notwith&s;tanding the Danger and Expence that attend it, <HI>is an Advantage</HI> to the Church of <HI>En|gland</HI> in <HI>America</HI>; why would not going thither for Ordination, be al&s;o an Advantage to all <HI>the Churches of the Colonies?</HI> And why is not this Ad|vantage generally pur&s;ued? For although their Candidates may be ordained here, there is no Doubt but, if they &s;hould be found qualified, they might be ordained in <HI>England,</HI> as well as ours. The Doctor declares that HE <HI>&s;hould e&s;teem it a happy Cir|cum&s;tance in this Ca&s;e, was he inclined to take Orders,</HI> that he mu&s;t go to <HI>England</HI> for that Purpo&s;e. If he was always of this Way of thinking, why did he not go to <HI>England</HI> to receive &s;uch Ordination as he has? It is no &s;ufficient An&s;wer to &s;ay that he could be ordained here; for if he was at Liberty to go to <HI>England,</HI> and if his going was con&s;idered by him as a Thing de&s;irable on the whole, it was ab|&s;urd in him not to go. Nay, if he is of &s;uch a cu|rious or adventurous Turn, why does he not gra|tify it by a Voyage now, although he is not <HI>inclined to take Orders?</HI> For, as I under&s;tand him, he &s;peaks in the pre&s;ent Ten&s;e. If a Man de&s;ires to go to <HI>England</HI> for a Thing which he might as well ob|tain without going; he mu&s;t be equally de&s;irous of going thither, if that Thing were intirely out of the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>BUT all Men have not the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition with the Doctor; and if <HI>many,</HI> to whom he has menti|oned the Matter, <HI>have declared them&s;elves to be of the &s;ame Mind,</HI> there are certainly many others, I imagine a great Majority, who have different Sen|timents.
<PB N="123" REF="011203_0133_0F94FA0B8C7F2478">
When Dr. <HI>Cutler,</HI> Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> and Mr. <HI>Browne,</HI> declared their Conformity to the Church, and went Home from <HI>Connecticut</HI> for Ordination; it is well known, that an Apprehen&s;ion of the Dangers of the Voyage, was what prevented &s;e|veral other Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters of that Colony, who&s;e Names I could mention, all Men of the like excellent Character with tho&s;e Gentlemen, from declaring al&s;o their Conformity, and going with them. This is a Fact which Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have heard of, and he can hardly have forgoten it. There have been frequent In&s;tances of the like Nature, of which probably he has not heard. Now with Regard to all &s;uch Per&s;ons, it is a great Hard&s;hip upon them, that they cannot obtain what they are de&s;irous of having; as it is a Hard&s;hip upon the Church, to be precluded from the Benefit of their Services, while they are &s;o greatly wanted.</P>
<P>AGAINST the Complaint of the <HI>Expen&s;ivene&s;s</HI> of a Voyage to <HI>England</HI> for Ordination, the Doctor advances an Objection, which carries with it the mo&s;t tremendous <HI>Appearance.</HI> As this Matter be|tween him and me has afforded &s;ome Speculation to the Curious, I will &s;tate and explain it with par|ticular Care.</P>
<P>IT was &s;aid in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> p. 34, that
<Q>the Ex|pence of this Voyage cannot be reckoned at le&s;s, upon an Average, than a hundred Pounds Sterling, to each Per&s;on</Q>
&mdash;and that it
<Q>mu&s;t generally fall upon &s;uch, as having already expended the greate&s;t Part of their Pittance in their Education, will find it extremely hard to rai&s;e a Sum &s;uffici|ent for the Purpo&s;e.</Q>
In An&s;wer to this, the
<PB N="124" REF="011203_0134_0F94FA0FB6395130">
Doctor very <HI>candidly &s;uppo&s;es I had never &s;een, or, if I had, did not remember at the Time of writing, the Account of the Society publi&s;hed in</HI> 1706, <HI>in which they &s;ay,</HI>
<Q>all young Students in tho&s;e Parts (<HI>the Colonies</HI>) who de&s;ire epi&s;copal Ordination, are invited into <HI>England</HI>; and their EXPENCES in coming and returning are to be defrayed by the Society,</Q>
p. 82. Again, he repeats this Ob|jection in p. 90; <HI>the Society,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>has publickly invited into England all young Students in the&s;e Parts, who de&s;ire holy Orders; declaring</HI> THAT THEIR EX|PENCE IN COMING AND RETURNING IS TO BE DE|FRAYED BY THE SOCIETY. <HI>This is the Fact truly &s;tated.</HI> The Complaint made in the <HI>Appeal</HI> is, that the Voyage is expen&s;ive; the An&s;wer by Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> is manife&s;tly contrived to excite the Idea, that it is not expen&s;ive. The Complaint &s;ays, the Expence upon an Average, is a hundred Pounds Sterling, to each Per&s;on; the An&s;wer leads the Reader to believe, that it is not a Farthing. But this is not the wor&s;t of it; the An&s;wer appears to me to be <HI>artfully</HI> calculated to lead the Reader al&s;o to believe Something farther&mdash;namely, that con|cerning a plain Matter of Fact, with Regard to which it is impo&s;&s;ible that any Mi&s;&s;ionary can be mi&s;taken, I have publi&s;hed to the World an ab&s;o|lute, wilful Fal&s;hood; a Fal&s;hood, which I knew might be ea&s;ily detected by any of our Adver&s;aries; a Fal&s;hood, which was known to be &s;uch, not only by every Mi&s;&s;ionary on the Continent, but by every Member of the Society both here and at Home, and by every Bi&s;hop in the Kingdom. So that I fear the Doctor really intended to lead his Readers to believe me to have been in this Matter, both a notorious Liar, and abominably &s;tupid. I have freely mentioned what I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect, and what
<PB N="125" REF="011203_0135_0F94FA100604F460">
I know to be &s;u&s;pected by many others. If he can exculpate him&s;elf, I think it greatly concerns him to do it: Or if any of his Friends can clear him, it is in their Power to do him a mo&s;t material Ser|vice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author of a <HI>fictitions</HI> Letter from <HI>a Member of the Society,</HI> which has been publi&s;hed in one of the <HI>New-York</HI> Papers, has endeavoured to vindicate Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> from the Charges of Fal&s;hood and In&s;incerity, which had been brought again&s;t him on Account of his Conduct in this Affair. But unle&s;s he &s;hould have the good Luck to meet with an abler and fairer Advocate, his Reputation mu&s;t &s;uffer, wherever the Ca&s;e &s;hall be known. The Doctor has received and pub|li&s;hed the formal <HI>Thanks</HI> of his Brethren, for his <HI>An&s;wer to the Appeal</HI>; it is hoped that they had no particular Reference to this Part of his Performance, when they paid him the Compliment.</NOTE>. Nothing le&s;s, in my Opinion, can excu&s;e him to the World and to his own Con&s;cience, than proper Evidence that he him&s;elf believes, and has Rea&s;on for believing, that I have actually been guilty of &s;uch ba&s;e and ab&s;urd Conduct, as his In&s;inuations manife&s;ly imply. But that he believes any &s;uch Thing him&s;elf, he does not &s;ay: He only &s;ays, that <HI>the Society</HI> HAS, meaning upwards of 60 Years ago, <HI>publickly invited</HI> over young Students, promi&s;ing to defray their Expences. This, not|with&s;tanding its Appearance, is not in Reality any Contradiction to my A&s;&s;ertion, which evidently related to the pre&s;ent State of the Church, and not to the State of it in the Beginning of this Century.</P>
<P>THAT the Society publi&s;hed &s;uch an Invitation in 1706, I believe to be true; but it appears that the Invitation was only occa&s;ional, and that none complied with it. It was not until &s;everal Years af|terwards, that the fir&s;t Candidates from this Coun|try went Home for holy Orders, before which
<PB N="126" REF="011203_0136_0F94FA10E3F4A2B8">
Time the Invitation was recalled, or rather had ex|pired; and neither they, nor any of their Succe&s;|&s;ors, &s;o far as I can learn, received Benefit from it. If the Doctor knew this, he mu&s;t have known that this antiquated Invitation of the Society, which never took Effect, was no more an An&s;wer to the Complaint again&s;t which he alledged it, than if he had quoted one of the ancient Engli&s;h Statutes a|gain&s;t the <HI>Lollards.</HI> If he knew it not, he ought to have &s;u&s;pected his own Ignorance, and to have inquired into the Matter, when he found that it was &s;o publickly and boldly a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>IN a Word; <HI>the Truth of Fact</HI> is, that the So|ciety are under no Engagements to defray the Ex|pences of Candidates in going home for Ordina|tion, and do not defray them, and, I believe, ne|ver have, &s;o much as in one In&s;tance, defrayed them, either wholly or in Part. In a few Ca&s;es they have made Donations to Candidates, in Con&s;idera|tion of &s;ome extraordinary Lo&s;&s;es or Di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;uffer|ed in their Voyage, but never more that I know of, than a Compen&s;ation for &s;uch extraordinary Lo&s;&s;es; and they make it a Rule to advance half a Year's Salary to their Mi&s;&s;ionaries, before their Embark|ation for <HI>America,</HI> to enable them the better to de|fray their own Expences. As this Matter is far|ther explained in a late well-received Pamphlet, written in <HI>Vindication</HI> of a Sermon of the Lord Bi&s;hop of LANDAFF, I need not enlarge upon it.</P>
<P>THE next Thing the Doctor controverts with me, is the following Ob&s;ervation.
<Q>Other Rea|&s;ons may have contributed to this general Want of Clergymen in <HI>America,</HI> but it has always been <HI>principally</HI> owing to the great Difficulty of ob|taining
<PB N="127" REF="011203_0137_0F94FA1704BE4390">
Ordination.</Q>
This Opinion might be a|bundantly &s;upported both by Authorities and Ar|guments; but it is &s;ufficient to con&s;ider what is objected again&s;t it. The Doctor, after telling us that the <HI>New-England</HI> Mi&s;&s;ions are generally filled, a&s;ks, upon my View of the Ca&s;e, <HI>why &s;hould the Diffi|culty be &s;o great in other Provinces, and none at all in the New-England ones, or &s;o incon&s;iderable, as to be ea&s;ily got over? If it was in it&s;elf a real and great Difficulty, its Operation would be as powerful in the&s;e Colonies as the other,</HI> p. 83. I never before heard, that the Difficulty of &s;upplying the <HI>New-England</HI> Mi&s;&s;ions with Clergymen, <HI>is none at all, or &s;o incon&s;iderable as to be</HI> EASILY <HI>got over.</HI> I be|lieve the Mi&s;&s;ionaries them&s;elves, and the People of their re&s;pective Mi&s;&s;ions, will agree in telling a very different Story. I will point out to the Doc|tor one Ca&s;e, which of it&s;elf is more than &s;uffici|ent to confute all that he has &s;aid, or can &s;ay, a|bout the <HI>Ea&s;ine&s;s</HI> of &s;upplying the <HI>New-England</HI> Mi&s;&s;ions. The Members of the Church of <HI>En|gland</HI> at <HI>Hebron,</HI> in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> exerted them&s;elves for near twenty Years, and were at great Expence in &s;ending home four Candidates &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, be|fore they had the Satisfaction of enjoying a re&s;ident Mi&s;&s;ionary. They fir&s;t &s;ent home Mr. <HI>Dean,</HI> in 1745, who was admitted to Holy Orders, and ap|pointed by the Society their Mi&s;&s;ionary for <HI>Hebron</HI>; but in returning to his Mi&s;&s;ion, and to a Wife and &s;everal &s;mall Children who depended upon him for their daily Support, he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have pe|ri&s;hed at Sea, neither the Ship nor any Per&s;on on board having been ever heard of. The next, was Mr. <HI>Colton</HI>; who in 1752, died on his Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>New-England,</HI> and was buried in the Ocean. The third Candidate &s;ent Home by
<PB N="128" REF="011203_0138_0F94FA18D4B08628">
this unfortunate People, was Mr. <HI>U&s;her</HI>; who, in his Way to <HI>England,</HI> in 1757, was taken by the <HI>French,</HI> thrown into Pri&s;on, and at la&s;t died in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Bayonne.</HI> The fourth was Mr. <HI>Peters</HI>; who in 1759, not long after his Arrival in <HI>En|gland,</HI> was taken with the Small-Pox, from which he had the good Fortune to recover&mdash;and at length, to the great Joy of the People, he arrived at <HI>He|bron,</HI> where he is at pre&s;ent the Society's worthy Mi&s;&s;ionary <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Ab&s;tract</HI> for 1759.</NOTE>. If any Pre&s;byterian or congregati|onal Society in the Colonies had &s;uffered in this Manner; much more, if all of them were ren|dered liable to &s;uffer in this Manner, through the Want of &s;uch a full Toleration as was allowed to all other religious Denominations; I am much mi&s;|taken, if the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions would not re&s;ound with, at lea&s;t, Lamentations and Com|plaints. And if the Legi&s;lature &s;hould not &s;peedi|ly interpo&s;e for the Relief of &s;uch Sufferers, the&s;e very Writers, who can con&s;ider the Matter as a meer Trifle in the Ca&s;e of the Church, would, if I know any Thing of their Genius and Di&s;po&s;ition, be found to make endle&s;s Outcries of Inju&s;tice and Cruelty. But &s;uch is the Blindne&s;s of &s;ome con|trover&s;ial Bigots, that on one Side they mi&s;take Mountains for Mole-Hills, and on the other Side, Mole-Hills for Mountains!</P>
<P>AFTER all, &s;hould I allow that, according to the Doctor's Repre&s;entation, there is no Difficulty, or rather that notwith&s;tanding the Difficulty, the <HI>New-England</HI> Mi&s;&s;ions are commonly &s;upplied; it will by no Means follow, that Difficulties which are &s;urmounted by the People of <HI>New-England,</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="011203_0139_0F94FA1A47B4ABE8">
would not intimidate and deter others, in the &s;outhern Colonies.</P>
<P>THE Doctor, not liking the Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> for the great Want of American Cler|gymen, proceeds to a&s;&s;ign Rea&s;ons of his own. One is, that the Society neglect the &s;outhern Colonies, that they may be more able to <HI>epi&s;copize</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>New-England.</HI> But this is &s;tale common-place Abu&s;e, and the Charge has been confuted over and over. It has been mo&s;t thoroughly confuted in a very full and compleat <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI>'s
<Q>Ob&s;ervations on the Charter and Conduct of the Society.</Q>
A Sentence indeed is quoted from the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Landaff's Sermon,</HI> to prove that this is the grand Object of <HI>the Society</HI>; but the Applica|tion of it to that Purpo&s;e is a manife&s;t Perver&s;ion. The Bi&s;hop &s;ays:
<Q>This Point (the propo&s;ed E|pi&s;copate) obtained, the <HI>American</HI> Church will go out of its infant State; be able to &s;tand upon its own Legs; and without foreign Help to &s;upport and &s;pread it&s;elf. THEN the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Society will have been brought to the happy I&s;&s;ue intended.</Q>
This la&s;t Sentence is what the Doctor alledges, as a Proof of the Society's Intentions. But let any impartial Per&s;on view its Connection with what preceded, and he will find it impo&s;&s;ible not to &s;ee, that the Bi&s;hop &s;ays no &s;uch Thing as he is made to &s;ay. His Lord&s;hip men|tions a Time, wherein
<Q>the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Soci|ety will be brought to the happy I&s;&s;ue intended;</Q>
but <HI>when</HI> does he &s;ay this Time will be? No other An&s;wer can fairly be given to the Que&s;tion than this: He &s;ays
<Q>the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Society will have been brought to the happy I&s;&s;ue intended,</Q>
when "the <HI>American</HI> Church" &s;hall
<Q>be able to
<PB N="130" REF="011203_0140_0F94FA1A8438D368">
&s;tand upon its own Legs, and without foreign Help to &s;upport and &s;pread it&s;elf.</Q>
But how does Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> an&s;wer the above Que&s;tion? Let us take it in his own Words: <HI>The View indeed of the Society,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>has been to epi&s;copize the&s;e Colo|nies, and this they have made their great Bu&s;ine&s;s: In&s;omuch that &s;hould it be accompli&s;hed,</HI>
<Q>it will THEN have been brought to the happy I&s;&s;ue in|tended, <HI>as we are told, in plain Words, by the Bi&s;hop of Landaff.</HI></Q>
Does then the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lan|daff</HI> tell us in <HI>plain Words,</HI> that
<Q>the happy I&s;&s;ue intended</Q>
by the Society is, according to the quaint Phra&s;eology lately introduced, the <HI>Epi&s;copization</HI> of the <HI>New-England</HI> Colonies? Does he &s;ay any Thing that implies it? Cannot the Church of <HI>En|gland</HI> in <HI>America</HI> &s;tand upon its own Legs and &s;up|port it&s;elf, until the Pre&s;byterians and Congregati|onali&s;ts of <HI>New-England</HI> &s;hall be made Pro&s;elytes to it? Do not the congregational Churches at this Day &s;tand upon their own Legs and &s;upport them|&s;elves in the Colonies without <HI>unepi&s;copizing</HI> the Members of the Church? In Order therefore to maintain his Charge again&s;t the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Landaff,</HI> even after an Abatement of what is &s;aid about <HI>plain Words,</HI> will not the Doctor be obliged to have Recour&s;e to <HI>Lord Peter</HI>'s Invention, of mak|ing it out <HI>totidem Literis,</HI> &s;ince he mu&s;t fail in the Method of attempting it <HI>totidem Verbis,</HI> and even <HI>totidem Syllabis?</HI> But enough of this.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Rea&s;on given by the Doctor for the Want of <HI>American</HI> Clergymen, is the Backward|ne&s;s of the Church People to educate their Sons for this Service. But if their Backwardne&s;s is much owing to the great Difficulty of obtaining Ordinati|on, as I am per&s;uaded it is, although the Doctor
<PB N="131" REF="011203_0141_0F94FA1B4B338208">
&s;uppo&s;es otherwi&s;e, it contradicts not, but coin|cides with, the general Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned in the <HI>Appeal.</HI></P>
<P>HIS la&s;t Rea&s;on is, <HI>the In&s;ufficiency of the Temp|tation, in mo&s;t Ca&s;es, to influence Candidates</HI> of other Denominations to conform to the Church. <HI>They have,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>a better Pro&s;pect in continu|ing with us, than they would have &s;hould they change Sides, and become Epi&s;copalians.</HI> This, I believe, is, and hitherto has been, the Ca&s;e; and now that it is confe&s;&s;ed on the Part of our Adver&s;aries, I hope we &s;hall no longer be reproached with con|forming to the Church from mercenary Motives. Tho&s;e Candidates who have given up the <HI>better Pro&s;pect in continuing with them,</HI> certainly ought not to be con&s;idered as Men of no Con&s;ciences, however mi&s;taken they may be thought to have been with Regard to their Principles. Many &s;uch we have already had; others are coming over to us daily; and had we Bi&s;hops in this Country, I &s;hould not doubt of a full Supply for all the Churches in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>IT was ob&s;erved in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> p. 36, that a very
<Q>glaring Di&s;advantage, to which the Church in <HI>America</HI> is manife&s;tly &s;ubject, ari&s;es from the Impo&s;&s;ibility that a Bi&s;hop re&s;iding in <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould be &s;ufficiently acquainted with the Cha|racters of tho&s;e who go home from this Country for Holy Orders. To this it is owing, that Or|dination has been &s;ometimes fraudulently and &s;ur|reptitiou&s;ly obtained by &s;uch Wretches, as are not only a Scandal to the Church, but a Di&s;|grace to human Nature.</Q>
Upon this, and more to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e &s;aid of &s;uch Per&s;ons, the Doc|tor,
<PB N="132" REF="011203_0142_0F94FA1C0BC79448">
with his u&s;ual Sagacity, ob&s;erves, in p. 85: <HI>Had &s;uch a Charge been publickly exhibited again&s;t the Society's Mi&s;&s;ionaries, by tho&s;e of the Pre&s;byteri|an or Congregational Per&s;ua&s;ion, it would have been di&s;regarded at home, and e&s;teemed by Epi&s;copalians here a &s;ure Argument of inveterate Enmity again&s;t the Church.</HI> The Doctor is right here; it would undoubtedly, and very ju&s;tly, be &s;o di&s;regarded and &s;o e&s;teemed. But will he venture to affirm, or does he mean to in&s;inuate, that I had <HI>exhibited &s;uch a Charge again&s;t the Society's Mi&s;&s;ionaries,</HI> or again&s;t the Body of the <HI>American</HI> Clergy? Did I &s;o much as mention the Mi&s;&s;ionaries? In &s;hort, did I utter a &s;in|gle Word that implies, or carries the lea&s;t Intimation, that I entertained an unfavourable Opinion of the <HI>American</HI> Clergy? On the other Hand, did I not declare my Belief to be, that their
<Q>general Cha|racter is truly re&s;pectable</Q>
&mdash;that
<Q>they are &s;ound and &s;teady in their Principles, and regular in their Behaviour?</Q>
But what I &s;aid was, that Ordinati|on had been SOMETIMES, or, as it was expre&s;&s;ed in another Place, IN SOME INSTANCES, fraudulently obtained by Wretches, who, in my Opinion, an&s;|wered the De&s;cription there given of them. When this was &s;aid, it was with Reference chiefly to Per|&s;ons that never were admitted into the Society's Service. Indeed there was one In&s;tance among the Mi&s;&s;ionaries that could not be overlooked; an In|&s;tance, which was the Subject of common Con|ver&s;ation at the Time of my writing, of a Per&s;on then lately ordained and appointed to a Mi&s;&s;ion in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI>&mdash;&s;aid to have been ordained upon Te&s;|timonials from this Country, which Te&s;timonials it was commonly thought mu&s;t have been <HI>forged,</HI> as his Character here was &s;o notoriou&s;ly infamous. But before this Per&s;on embarked for his Mi&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="133" REF="011203_0143_0F94FA1CC949A3C8">
his true Character was di&s;covered, and the Society immediately di&s;carded him. Now of &s;uch Clergy|men as the&s;e, who <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> creep into the Church, <HI>tho&s;e of the Pre&s;byterian or Congregational Per&s;ua&s;ion,</HI> may &s;peak as reproachfully as they plea&s;e, and no <HI>Epi&s;copalians,</HI> either <HI>here</HI> or <HI>at home,</HI> will <HI>e&s;teem</HI> it <HI>an Argument of inveterate Enmity to the Church.</HI> We think no De&s;cription too bad for &s;uch Wretch|es; we never &s;pare them our&s;elves; we blame not the Di&s;&s;enters for any Severity of Language to|wards them. But what we blame them for, is, their indi&s;criminate Invectives again&s;t the Epi&s;co|pal Clergy in general&mdash;again&s;t the whole Body of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries&mdash;and, which has been very frequent of late, again&s;t all tho&s;e that have met together in <HI>voluntary Convention.</HI> The Doctor has not run the Length of &s;ome others; but I could mention cer|tain periodical Writers, who have &s;ignalized them|&s;elves by the mo&s;t undi&s;tingui&s;hing and illiberal Abu&s;e of the Clergy, of the Bi&s;hops, and indeed of every Thing that relates to the Church; and if &s;ome of their Accounts might be taken, the Con|clu&s;ion would naturally be made, that there is not a Clergyman in the Colonies who is of a tolerable Character, any more than a Bi&s;hop in the Kingdom who is not a &s;piritual Tyrant, a lordly Oppre&s;&s;or, a Friend of Per&s;ecution, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>AS to the Matter of Te&s;timonials, the Doctor &s;uppo&s;es <HI>the Ca&s;e would be the &s;ame was there</HI> A <HI>Bi|&s;hop in America,</HI> as it is at pre&s;ent; &s;ince he could not be particularly acquainted with the Characters of the Candidates. <HI>One</HI> Bi&s;hop only is not thought &s;ufficient for all the Colonies in America; but had we Bi&s;hops, they might be per&s;onally acquainted, if not with all the Candidates, yet with all tho&s;e
<PB N="134" REF="011203_0144_0F94FA1DC9CC29D8">
from whom Te&s;timonials mu&s;t come; and &s;uch an Acquaintance would enable them to make ne|ce&s;&s;ary Di&s;tinctions, and to give to each Recom|mendation the Weight re&s;pectively due to it. One Clergyman's Recommendation is equal to another's, if they are both con&s;idered only as Clergymen; but if they are con&s;idered under their di&s;tingui&s;hing Characters, the one being perhaps a Per&s;on of un|common Penetration and inflexible Integrity, the other but of an ordinary Capacity, and ea&s;ily bi|a&s;&s;ed and deceived, their different Te&s;timonies will have a very unequal Force, with the Bi&s;hop who knows them. But as what might properly be &s;aid here, has been anticipated already; I beg Leave to refer the Reader to it, rather than to repeat it. Upon the Whole, had we Bi&s;hops in this Country, I am firmly per&s;uaded, that with proper Care, and due Regulations, it would be next to impo&s;&s;ible for a Man of an exceptionable Character to obtain Ordination. One general Regulation, if I might take the Liberty, I would humbly propo&s;e, viz. That, when the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate &s;hall be &s;ettled, the Plan marked out in the Directions of Archbi|&s;hop Wake to the Bi&s;hops of his Province in 1716, &s;o far as it relates to the Subject of Te&s;timonials, with a few Alterations, &s;hould be an e&s;tabli&s;hed Rule for the American Bi&s;hops <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Directions at large in Burn's <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Law,</HI> Title ORDINATION.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>IT is certain,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, in p. 87, <HI>many notoriou&s;ly wicked Per&s;ons in England, va&s;tly more in Proportion than in America, have found Ways&mdash;to get into Orders</HI>; and he endeavours in many Places to e&s;tabli&s;h a Belief, that the Clergy at home, under the immediate Government of Bi&s;hops, are wor&s;e,
<PB N="135" REF="011203_0145_0F94FA220543AFD0">
than they are here without an Epi&s;copate. And he leaves his Readers to draw for them&s;elves this natural Inference, that American Bi&s;hops will be more likely to corrupt, than to reform the Cler|gy. But what he calls <HI>certain,</HI> is a Matter concern|ing which others may po&s;&s;ibly think that he cannot obtain <HI>Certainty.</HI> But allowing it to be true, that there are in Proportion more immoral Clergymen there than in America; unle&s;s he can make it ap|pear, that more Per&s;ons, in Proportion, of bad Characters <HI>at the Time of their Ordination,</HI> are ad|mited from a common Dioce&s;s in England, than from America, the Ob&s;ervation will not an&s;wer his Purpo&s;e. The Point under Con&s;ideration, is the Ca&s;e of bad Men's obtaining Te&s;timonials, and impo&s;ing upon the Bi&s;hop; but if a Man, of a fair Reputation, at the Time of his being ordained, afterwards relap&s;es and becomes Profligate, he is not within the Compa&s;s of the pre&s;ent Argument. But &s;hould we grant all that the Doctor contends for; it has been already &s;hewn, that the Ca&s;e of the Church here, under an Epi&s;copate, will be &s;o very different from what it is in England, with Re|&s;pect to the Bi&s;hop's Superintendency, that the In|ference intended will not follow.</P>
<P>DR. <HI>Chauncy</HI> clo&s;es his third Section with this Ob&s;ervation: <HI>Should the whole of what the Dr. has offered be allowed its full Force,</HI> (which, by the Way, is an Acknowledgment that hitherto he had not allowed its full Force to what I had offered) <HI>without the lea&s;t Abatement,</HI> (and why &s;hould there be any Abatement of the <HI>real</HI> Force of my Argu|ment or Ob&s;ervation?) <HI>There is no other Hard&s;hip, or Difficulty, in the Ca&s;e, than what naturally re|&s;ults from profe&s;&s;ed Principles, and mu&s;t unavoidably
<PB N="136" REF="011203_0146_0F94FA23E4AD1578">
follow upon them, unle&s;s an E&s;tabli&s;hment is pur|po&s;ely made in their Favor,</HI> p. 88. I am not clear that I under&s;tand the Meaning of this Sentence. What an E&s;tabli&s;hment has to do with the Subject in Debate, I know not. This has never been re|que&s;ted&mdash;It is no Part of our Plan&mdash;nor is it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the Execution of it; Ordination by a Bi&s;hop no more &s;uppo&s;ing, or implying, or depen|ding upon, or being connected with, a civil E&s;ta|bli&s;hment, than the Admini&s;tration of Bapti&s;m by a Pre&s;byter. As to the other Part of the Sentence, there is &s;omething in it that looks extremely ill-favoured. <HI>There is no other Hard&s;hip, or Difficulty, in the Ca&s;e, than what naturally ari&s;es from profe&s;&s;ed Principles!</HI> This looks as if, in the Doctor's Opi|nion, Men were not to be pitied, when their Suf|ferings re&s;ult from their Principles. The mo&s;t dreadful Per&s;ecutions are no more than Sufferings inflicted upon Men for, and con&s;equently, in &s;ome Sen&s;e re&s;ulting from, <HI>their profe&s;&s;ed Principles.</HI> But does the Doctor mean that we &s;hould be left to &s;uffer, becau&s;e it is on Account of our Principles? Or that Men, of who&s;e Principles HE does not ap|prove, ought to be per&s;ecuted? From arguing upon the Matter <HI>a priori,</HI> I cannot believe that he means this; from arguing <HI>a po&s;teriori,</HI> I know not what to believe.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE De&s;ign of the fourth Section of the <HI>Ap|peal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. IV.</NOTE> was to &s;hew the unparalleled Hard&s;hip of the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e of the Church of England in the American Colonies. That for Want of an Epi&s;|copate, the American Church of England is really in a &s;uffering State, the Members of it feel, in in|numerable In&s;tances; and by this Time it mu&s;t be &s;o evident to others, that a formal Proof of it is needle&s;s. That the particular Species or Mode of this Suffering is <HI>unparalleled,</HI> is as evident as that we &s;uffer at all. It is in this Re&s;pect, and not on Ac|count of the <HI>Degree</HI> of Suffering, that the Word <HI>unparalleled</HI> was u&s;ed. This was &s;ufficiently ex|plained in the <HI>Appeal</HI> by the Word <HI>unprecedented,</HI> and it is inconceivable that any can mi&s;take it, un|le&s;s they mi&s;take wilfully.</P>
<P>AGAINST what was &s;aid of the Church of Eng|land's being in a mo&s;t wretched and deplorable Condition in the Colonies, Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> objects: <HI>It may, on the contrary, be affirmed, as a mo&s;t unque&s;|tionable Truth, that the Epi&s;copal Churches in mo&s;t of the Colonies, are favored and di&s;tingui&s;hed far beyond any other Churches of whatever Denomination on the Continent,</HI> p. 92. The Rea&s;on which &s;upports this A&s;&s;ertion immediately follows: They <HI>are pre&s;erved in being by a va&s;tly exten&s;ive Charity.</HI> By the Way, it is no Evidence that a Church is not in a deplorable Con|dition, that it owes the Pre&s;ervation of its very Be|ing,
<PB N="138" REF="011203_0148_0F94FA25E075E7F0">
to Charity. The Charity here meant, is that of the Venerable <HI>Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel,</HI> of the Greatne&s;s of which, we are as &s;en|&s;ible as the Doctor. The Charity of this Society is as unprecedented in Degree, as the Sufferings of the American Church are in Kind; and when|ever we con&s;ider it, it prevents, in a great Mea|&s;ure our <HI>&s;ighing out Groans</HI> (or groaning out Sighs) as it pre&s;ents to us <HI>abundant Rea&s;on for the mo&s;t grateful Acknowledgments.</HI> But notwith&s;tanding the Care the Society has taken to provide proper Cler|gymen for de&s;titute Congregations, and the Expen|ces it has been at in &s;upporting them; without an Epi&s;copate, the Church wants an e&s;&s;ential Part of her Con&s;titution, &s;ome of her mo&s;t important Of|fices cannot be performed at all, and her common ones are frequently not performed &s;o well, as might be expected under the Superintendency of re&s;ident Bi&s;hops. This, I will venture to &s;ay again, is a deplorable Condition for any Church to be in, whether &s;he has Revenues of her own, or &s;ub&s;i&s;ts upon Charity; and none can be more &s;en&s;ible of it, than the Society it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS State, which is deplorable in it&s;elf, is al&s;o unprecedented and unparalleled. That other Chur|ches have not been as <HI>great</HI> Sufferers as the Church of England in the Colonies, was never pretended. Perhaps all <HI>really</HI> per&s;ecuted Churches have, upon the whole, &s;uffered as much, and many certainly have &s;uffered infinitely more; while the Members of &s;ome, have made loud Complaints of Per&s;ecu|tion, who have not had &s;o ju&s;t Rea&s;on to complain, as we have. But if the Suffering of the American Church of England is not uncommon as to the De|gree of it, yet all mu&s;t allow that it is of a very
<PB N="139" REF="011203_0149_0F94FA2688FAF728">
extraordinary Nature. In what Age, in what Part of the World, can a like In&s;tance be found, either among Chri&s;tians or Pagans? Where, and when, did any Nation &s;uffer its own Religion, the Reli|gion which it had freely cho&s;en and e&s;tabli&s;hed at Home, to be upon a wor&s;e Footing, than all other Religions, in its Colonies? In Colonies con&s;i&s;ting, not of conquered Enemies, but of Children that had i&s;&s;ued from its own Loins? If an Example can be found, let it be pointed out. We will then confe&s;s that our Ca&s;e is not <HI>unprecedented</HI>; but &s;till, that it is not <HI>very hard,</HI> we will never confe&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>it is unaccountably &s;trange that he</HI> (the Author of the <HI>Appeal) &s;hould mention it as</HI> 'an unprecedented Ca&s;e,' <HI>and de&s;cribe the Church as</HI> '&s;ingled out for the fir&s;t Example of it'. We &s;ay, and believe, it is the fir&s;t; if he knows of another, let him produce it. Why, &s;ays the Doc|tor, <HI>did he never hear of the infinitely more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Condition of the great Numbers that were deprived, fined, impri&s;oned, and, in other Ways, mo&s;t cruelly dealt with, in the Days of tho&s;e hard-hearted Arch|bi&s;hops, Parker, Bancroft, Whitgift, and Laud?</HI> Yes, I have heard of the&s;e Things; and I a&s;&s;ure him, that whatever I think of Deprivations in &s;ome Ca&s;es, I am no Friend to Fines and Impri&s;onments on a religious Account. But I never heard before, that the Ca&s;e here mentioned, was parallel with the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e of the Church of England in Ame|rica, or that it was a Precedent of the like Nature; which it is here his only Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;hew. I have heard al&s;o of the Babyloni&s;h Captivity; and I be|lieve it to be a Precedent as much to the Purpo&s;e, as the In&s;tance he has mentioned. But whether the In&s;tance was pertinent or not, &s;eems to have
<PB N="140" REF="011203_0150_0F95324516F814C8">
been thought no Matter of Con&s;equence; it was &s;ufficient for his Purpo&s;e, that it afforded an Op|portunity of introducing a Number of Archbi&s;hops, in order to blacken their Characters.</P>
<P>AS to the Archbi&s;hops Parker and Whitgift, they &s;uperintended and conducted the Affairs of the Church, during the greate&s;t Part of Queen Elizabeth's Reign. As they were Men of Firmne&s;s and Re&s;olution, &s;o they appear to have been not wanting in Temper and Moderation at the &s;ame Time. The Doctor repre&s;ents them under the Idea of Per&s;ecutors: But we meet but with few Acts of undue Severity, and many of exemplary Mildne&s;s and Gentlene&s;s, in the Cour&s;e of their Proceedings, In the <HI>Appendix</HI> to the Life of the former <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book II. Numb. XXIV.</NOTE>, Strype has given us a Letter from the Queen to him, in which &s;he blames <HI>him</HI> and the other Bi&s;hops, for their Backwardne&s;s in urging Conformity.</P>
<P>AS to Whitgift, even Wil&s;on, who was more than half a Puritan him&s;elf, &s;ays of him, that
<Q>he &s;trove to prevail on the Puritans with <HI>Sweet|ne&s;s and Gentlene&s;s</HI>; and died&mdash;leaving a Name, like a &s;weet Perfume behind him</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Three Letters</HI> to the Author of the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ional; Let.</HI> I. p. 31.</NOTE>. We learn from Strype, that his natural Temper was mild, and that he treated even his great Antagoni&s;t, Cart|wright, when he had him in his Power, &s;o courteou&s;|ly and kindly, that the Earl of Leice&s;ter, the Pa|tron of the latter, thanked the Archbi&s;hop for his remarkable Civility to him. One of his wor&s;t and mo&s;t implacable Enemies was the fiery Udal, a Leader of the Puritans: When this Per&s;on was

under Sentence of Death for Felony, the Archbi&s;hop made Intere&s;t in his Favor, and actually obtained his Pardon, according to the &s;ame Hi&s;torian. But I need not be particular, as the general Conduct to|wards the Puritans under the Reign of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and therein the Behaviour of the Archbi&s;hops was fully vindicated by Secretary <HI>Wal&s;ingham,</HI> who was as good a Judge of it as any Man in the Kingdom, and being always inclined to favor the Puritans, he cannot be &s;u&s;pected of Partiality again&s;t them <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In his Letter to Mon&s;ieur Critoy, in Burnet's Hi&s;t. Ref. Vol. II.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>BANCROFT</HI> was more rigorous in his Mea&s;ures than his immediate Predece&s;&s;or, and the Times required it. Laud was &s;till more &s;evere than Ban|croft, and his Provocations were greater. I un|dertake not to ju&s;tify all their Proceedings; for I abhor every Appearance of Intolerance and Cruelty, even in an Archbi&s;hop. The&s;e Appearances are the greate&s;t Blemi&s;hes of their Characters; and they are the general Reproach of the Age in which they acted. There was not a Puritan in the Kingdom at that Time, nor had there been from the Begin|ning, who did not give inconte&s;tible Evidence, that if he had been armed with the like Power, he would have pre&s;&s;ed Conformity to his own Sy&s;tem, with as unrelenting Zeal, as either of tho&s;e Prelates. Not long afterwards, the Puritans became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Power; Conformity then was urged with a Venge|ance. In the Collection of Sermons preached before the <HI>long Parliament,</HI> Toleration is profe&s;&s;edly con|demned by Burge&s;s, Ca&s;e, Calamy, Baxter, Newco|men, and many others, as one of the greate&s;t Evils.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Two Archbi&s;hops: If we conceive of them under the Idea only of rigorous
<PB N="142" REF="011203_0152_0F9532442F3338B0">
Exacters of Conformity, we do them Inju&s;tice. It ought to be remembered that they were Men of eminent Abilities, of invincible Integrity, of undi&s;|&s;embled Piety, and zealous Advocates for the Pro|te&s;tant Religion.
<Q>Bancroft, &s;ays Fuller, was a mo&s;t &s;tout Champion to a&s;&s;ert Church Di&s;cipline.</Q>
But to &s;hew that there was &s;omething amiable in his Di&s;po&s;ition, and that he could mingle Kindne&s;s with his Severity towards &s;uch as appeared to be truly con&s;cientious, he gives the following In&s;tan|ce:
<Q>An hone&s;t and able Mini&s;ter privately pro|te&s;ted to him, that it went again&s;t his Con&s;cience to conform, being then ready to be deprived: <HI>Which Way,</HI> &s;aith the Archbi&s;hop, <HI>will you live, if put out of your Benefice?</HI> The other an&s;wered, <HI>he had no Way but to go a begging, and put him&s;elf on Divine Providence. That,</HI> &s;aith the Archbi|&s;hop, <HI>you &s;hall not need to do, but come to me, and I will take Order for your</HI> Maintenance.</Q>

<P>WHAT I conceive to be the true Character of Laud, I will give in the Words of a ma&s;terly and candid Writer, in An&s;wer to the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ional.</HI>
<Q>Here, Sir, give me Leave to pay a Debt due to Truth, and to the Memory of Archbi&s;hop Laud, whom <HI>You</HI> treat in a Manner very unbecoming his Character and your own. He was undoubted|ly much too vehement in his natural Temper; and the general Di&s;po&s;ition of the Times on both Sides increa&s;ed his Heat. He was al&s;o too fond of Externals in Religion. But &s;ome Regard ought to be paid to his Learning, his Liberality, his excellent Book again&s;t Popery, and the &s;uc|ce&s;sful Pains which he &s;o kindly took to recover Chillingworth back from it.

Treatment likewi&s;e of the famous John Hales, and the E&s;teem of that great Man for him, who mourned for his Death in a mo&s;t remarkable Manner, and wi&s;hed he had died in his &s;tead, prove him to have had, together with his very blameable Rigors, no &s;mall Merit of the good-natured Kind; to which, Per&s;ons in after Times, who could not know him &s;o well, have by no Means done &s;ufficient Ju&s;tice</Q>

<P>THE Doctor goes on: <HI>Did he never hear of any barbarous Acts pa&s;&s;ed in the Reign of King Charles</HI> II. <HI>&s;ubjecting Multitudes of Clergymen and others to Hard&s;hips and Sufferings, not to be thought of with|out Horror?</HI> This Que&s;tion I mu&s;t al&s;o an&s;wer in the affirmative. I have <HI>heard</HI> of all tho&s;e Acts which are here called barbarous; and I have <HI>&s;een</HI> the Rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for framing and pa&s;&s;ing them&mdash; which Rea&s;ons, if not altogether &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify, will go very far towards excu&s;ing, them.</P>
<P>WE are told in a Note, that <HI>by one of tho&s;e Acts</HI> (meaning the Act of Uniformity) <HI>no le&s;s than</HI> Two THOUSAND <HI>Mini&s;ters, many of them Men of &s;hining Accompli&s;hments, and</HI> ALL <HI>of them well &s;poken of for their Piety, were turned out of their Livings in one black Day, whereby both they and their Families, became liable to &s;tarve for Want of the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life.</HI> The Character of the ejected Mini&s;ters as given by Walker, who made the mo&s;t indefatigable Examination into the per&s;onal Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Times, is very different from what the Doctor here publi&s;hes, after Calamy and others. His Account is too long to be in&s;erted; but the Sub&s;tance of it, as extracted by Grey, and given in his An&s;wer to
<PB N="144" REF="011203_0154_0F953247501CF448">
Peirce, is in the&s;e Words:
<Q>But to con&s;ider the Number and Characters of the Per&s;ons a little far|ther, we learn from an Hi&s;torian of good Credit, that tho&s;e who gave up their Livings to the <HI>right Owners,</HI> which had been <HI>u&s;urped</HI> from them, and which in Right and Ju&s;tice were to be re&s;tored, and the Curates who were <HI>prevented</HI> having any Preferments, without Conformity, made up above half of the Number; and among&s;t them there were <HI>not a few Mechanicks,</HI> and Fellows bred to the meane&s;t Occupations; many more who had &s;een neither of the Univer&s;ities; &s;everal <HI>Troopers</HI> and others who had &s;erved in the Re|bels Armies; be&s;ides, &s;ome had run in with, and vented many of the di&s;tingui&s;hed Enthu&s;i|a&s;ms, Errors, Here&s;ies, and other mon&s;trous Opinions, not to &s;ay Bla&s;phemies of the Times; many had no Orders at all, nor were there want|ing among&s;t the&s;e, &s;uch as had been &s;o far from pretending to any, that they utterly exclaimed again&s;t them; &s;ome had a Thou&s;and Times <HI>for|feited their Lives</HI> to the Law, by having their Tongues and Hands &s;tained in Trea&s;on and Blood, as well of their Prince him&s;elf, as Fel|low-Subjects. Nay, the &s;ame Author informs us, that to the be&s;t of his Remembrance, he had not met with an In&s;tance of more than one &s;ingle Per&s;on, who had any other Title antece|dent to the urgent Nece&s;&s;ity of the Act of 1660, to the Places from which they were removed, than what Seque&s;tration, Plunder, U&s;urpation and Rebellion had given them. So that the Ca&s;e is not &s;o lamentable, as this Gentleman and his Brother Calamy would have it; and when they pretend that the Sufferings of the&s;e Men will &s;carce admit of a Parallel in any Age or Nati|on,

So as his Party which he glorieth &s;o much in, will &s;carely de|&s;erve to be named the &s;ame Day. And if he compare their Per&s;ecutions; the Sufferings of his &s;uppo&s;ed Confe&s;&s;ors will appear to be but Flea-Bitings in Compari&s;on of theirs. But after all this, the greate&s;t Di&s;parity remaineth yet un|touched,

The&s;e Things, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, have but little Connection with the Subject. They ought al&s;o, if po&s;&s;ible, for the Honour of the national Character, and the prote&s;tant Religi|on, to be buried in eternal Oblivion. But I have been forced to mention them; and tho&s;e who have obliged me to it ought not to blame me; while others who &s;ee the Provocation, I tru&s;t, will at lea&s;t think me excu&s;eable.</P>
<P>AS to the <HI>Te&s;t-Act,</HI> the Doctor need not be told the only De&s;ign of it, was to prevent the Enemies of the Church from geting Power to de&s;troy Her. This Security it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to provide; and <HI>Rapin,</HI> who was a Pre&s;byterian him&s;elf, has in Effect ju&s;tified the general Policy of that Act. For he makes no Scruple to declare, in his <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation on the Whigs and Tories,</HI> not that there is a Proba|bility, for he knew it to be more than probable&mdash; but, that
<Q><HI>'tis certain,</HI> if the Pre&s;byterians can ever act without Controul, they will not be &s;a|tisfied till the Hierarchy of the Church of <HI>En|gland</HI> be <HI>intirely demoli&s;hed.</HI></Q>
That &s;uch Per&s;ons therefore &s;hould be &s;o far controuled, as they are by this Act, will not, I believe, be pronounced to be unju&s;t or improper by any, but tho&s;e who find them&s;elves di&s;appointed by its Operation. But I will not inlarge upon this Subject, &s;ince writing in Favour of the Te&s;t-Act, or &s;ome other <HI>equivalent</HI> Security, is as needle&s;s, as writing again&s;t it will be u&s;ele&s;s, after what has been &s;aid in <HI>Vindication</HI> of it by the late Bi&s;hops <HI>Sherlock</HI> and <HI>Ellys.</HI></P>

<P>THE Doctor concludes this Affair of <HI>Precedents</HI> in a Strain truly con&s;i&s;tent with his whole Repre|&s;entation.

p. 95. That what <HI>the Di&s;&s;enters have paid,</HI> in the Way of TITHES, <HI>towards the Support of the epi&s;co|cal Clergy,</HI> ought not to be included in this Ac|count, has been proved in the <HI>Tenth Section</HI> of the Appeal, which the Doctor, for a certain Rea&s;on, has thought fit not to controvert. After this De|duction, he will find it difficult to make all his <HI>Items</HI> amount to the Sum of <HI>a Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling, many Times told,</HI> within <HI>the Cour&s;e of Sixty Years,</HI> unle&s;s he takes into his Computation the Po&s;ts of <HI>Profit in the Kingdom</HI> of SOUTH-BRI|TAIN, from which Di&s;&s;enters may have been ex|cluded. As he &s;eems to look upon the&s;e as their <HI>natural Rights,</HI> it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that, in this View of the Matter, there is no Impropriety in con&s;idering all that might have been gained by &s;uch Po&s;ts, under the Notion of Lo&s;s, and pa&s;&s;ing it to the <HI>Credit</HI> of the Di&s;&s;enters Account. But this will not be admitted as <HI>fair,</HI> by the World in general, which has a different Idea of <HI>natural Rights.</HI></P>
<P>NATURAL Rights, when the Expre&s;&s;ion is u&s;ed properly, can &s;ignify nothing le&s;s than &s;uch Rights as Men are born to&mdash;&s;uch as they are intitled to upon the common Footing of Humanity, without any Di&s;tinction of Chri&s;tian or Pagan, Prote&s;tant or Papi&s;t. Whatever therefore is the natural Right of one Man, is the natural Right of another; and if Di&s;&s;enters may ju&s;tly complain of being deprived of a natural Right, in the Ca&s;e before us, &s;o may Pa|pi&s;ts, Jews and Mahometans; their natural Rights being the very &s;ame with tho&s;e of the Di&s;&s;enters, and, I may add, of the Members of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Church. This is &s;o evident, that all Au|thors have either a&s;&s;erted or admitted it, a few

In&s;tances only excepted. The <HI>American Whig</HI> is obliged to confe&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb.

<P>I AM next led to review a Pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> which uncommon Pains has been taken to pervert, with a De&s;ign of making me appear to have been an Impeacher of the LOYALTY of the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>America.</HI> The obnoxious Pa&s;&s;age is this:
<Q>We <HI>i. e.</HI> the Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> are con&s;cious of no Crimes, with Regard to the State. On the other Hand, we claim a Right to be con&s;idered as equal with the Foremo&s;t</Q>
(the <HI>American Whig,</HI> to an&s;wer a Purpo&s;e of his own, quotes it, the MOST Foremo&s;t)
<Q>in every due Ex|pre&s;&s;ion of Fidelity and Loyalty. We e&s;teem our|&s;elves bound, not only by pre&s;ent Intere&s;t and Inclination, but by the more &s;acred Ties of our religious Principles and Chri&s;tian Duty, to &s;up|port, to the utmo&s;t, the national civil E&s;ta|bli&s;hment. Accordingly no Trumpet of Sedi|tion was ever heard to &s;ound from our Pulpits&mdash; no Seeds of Di&s;affection have been &s;uffered more privately to be &s;own in our Hou&s;es. As our Re|ligion teaches us, in the fir&s;t Place, and above all Things, to <HI>fear God</HI>; &s;o, while we can pre&s;erve it, it will be a full Security to the Government

p. 41. In this Pa&s;&s;age it is evident, that the Loyalty of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in the Colonies, is &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted; which Loyalty our Enemies have never pretended to di&s;pute. The <HI>American Whig</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. II.</NOTE> is &s;o ju&s;t as to take Notice of the Author of the <HI>Ap|peal</HI>'s "profe&s;&s;ed Loyalty," and of
<Q>that Zeal for the Con&s;titution and Government at Home, to which he and his Brethren avow a warm At|tachment.</Q>
Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> allows the Loyalty of Epi&s;copalians to be <HI>equal</HI> with that of <HI>other Deno|minations of Men in this Country.</HI> Now no more than this is directly a&s;&s;erted in the <HI>Appeal.</HI> But the former in&s;i&s;ts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Numb. IX.</NOTE> that the Author, in the above Pa&s;|&s;age,
<Q><HI>plainly</HI> intended to in&s;inuate, that &s;ome other Denominations among us are <HI>con&s;cious of Crimes with Re&s;pect to the State.</HI></Q>
The Doctor is not <HI>po&s;itive</HI> as to this Matter, but cautiou&s;ly &s;ays, <HI>&s;ome are</HI> DISPOSED <HI>to think he</HI> (the Author of the <HI>Appeal) would not have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in this Manner, unle&s;s he had intended an In&s;inuation, that &s;omething of this Nature had been done by others.</HI> p. 96. The Reader can examine the Pa&s;&s;age for him&s;elf, and judge, whether the Interpretation of it, concerning which the <HI>American Whig</HI> is po&s;itive, and the Doctor doubtful, is not forced and unna|tural. For &s;urely, to &s;ay that our Loyalty is equal with that of others, implies not that it is &s;uperior, or that the Loyalty of others is defective, unle&s;s Words are perverted from their natural Meaning: It rather implies, on the contrary, that the Loyal|ty of others is not inferior to ours.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="011203_0161_0F95324C71569998">THIS &s;eems to be admitted by the periodical Writer la&s;t mentioned. But then he interrogates, <HI>why</HI> I was not <HI>&s;atisfied with &s;imply avering that</HI> my <HI>Brethren were as loyal Subjects as others?</HI> I doubt not but the candid and impartial have been able to &s;ee the following Rea&s;on for it, and that it &s;uffici|ently Accounts for the Mode of Expre&s;&s;ion. The Paragraph is introduced with this Ob&s;ervation, that notwith&s;tanding the &s;uffering Condition of the <HI>A|merican</HI> Church, we, who are Members of it,
<Q>are not apprehen&s;ive that it can be owing to the Di&s;|plea&s;ure of our Superiors.</Q>
Why not apprehen|&s;ive of their Di&s;plea&s;ure? Becau&s;e we are con&s;cious of no Crimes that have de&s;erved it.
<Q>No Trumpet of Sedition was ever heard to &s;ound from our Pulpits&mdash;no Seeds of Di&s;affection have been &s;uf|fered more privately to be &s;own in our Hou&s;es.</Q>
The&s;e Crimes, or the Su&s;picions of them, are the common Cau&s;es of the Di&s;plea&s;ure of Government, again&s;t particular Cla&s;&s;es or Denominations of Men, in all Countries. But we are intirely innocent, and &s;uch Crimes have never been &s;o much as imputed to us. On the other Hand, our Intere&s;t and Incli|nation con&s;pire with our religious Principles, to &s;e|cure our Loyalty. We con&s;ider it as a Matter of &s;trict Duty and of religious Obligation to
<Q>honor the King,</Q>
and
<Q>not to meddle with them that are given to Change,</Q>
as really and e&s;&s;entially as to "fear God." This appears to me to be the natural Con&s;truction of the Paragraph; and it cor|re&s;ponds exactly with my View in writing it, which was only to maintain, by a &s;hort Induction of Par|ticulars, that we are free from tho&s;e Crimes and Imputations, which are commonly a&s;&s;igned as Rea|&s;ons for the Frowns of Government; and con&s;e|quently
<PB N="152" REF="011203_0162_0F95324D2F751410">
that we have no Cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect the Go|vernment at Home is di&s;plea&s;ed with us.</P>
<P>IN tran&s;cribing for the Pre&s;s, I &s;aw what U&s;e might be made of the Pa&s;&s;age by ill-di&s;po&s;ed Per|&s;ons; and therefore, not thinking it nece&s;&s;ary to alter the Structure of the Paragraph, added this <HI>Note,</HI> to &s;ecure it again&s;t Mi&s;interpretation and A|bu&s;e.
<Q>This Declaration is not intended to imply any Accu&s;ation of others; who are able, it is hoped, to make their own Defence, whenever the Occa&s;ion &s;hall require it. His Maje&s;ty's <HI>A|merican</HI> Subjects, of all Denominations, belong|ing to the old Colonies, have always profe&s;&s;ed Sentiments of Loyalty; and the Author believes they have generally been <HI>&s;incere</HI> in tho&s;e Profe&s;|&s;ions.</Q>
I then proceeded to account for &s;ome late undutiful Appearances, in a Manner con&s;i&s;tent with the Loyalty profe&s;&s;ed. Now, does this look like an Impeachment of <HI>American</HI> Loyalty? Is it not in Reality, a Defence of it? How unfair and unrighteous then is it, to endeavour to rai&s;e a po|pular Clamour again&s;t me, on the &s;ole Evidence of this very Pa&s;&s;age; a Pa&s;&s;age, which proves that I have acted the Part of a true Friend, where I am abu&s;ed for having acted as an Enemy! Upon the whole: If the Words in the Text naturally carried an In&s;inuation again&s;t the Loyalty of &s;ome <HI>Ameri|cans,</HI> which In&s;inuation was not intended; the Ex|planation in the Note intirely removes it, and places the Matter in the mo&s;t favourable Light. Nothing wor&s;e is &s;aid of Americans, including the various religious Denominations, than that they have always profe&s;&s;ed Sentiments of Loyalty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Had <HI>Numb.</HI> V. of the <HI>American Whig</HI> been publi&s;h|ed, I &s;hould perhaps have excepted the Author, and the A|bettors, of that Performance, as Per&s;ons who&s;e Loyalty is, at lea&s;t, very que&s;tionable.</NOTE>, and that the
<PB N="153" REF="011203_0163_0F95324DED5DDC70">
Author believed them to have been generally &s;in|cere in tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE Doctor will not allow, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> in the Colonies is
<Q>di&s;tingui&s;hed and &s;tig|matized by a Want of tho&s;e religious Privileges which are granted to all other Denominations.</Q>
His Objection is this: <HI>The Truth is,</HI> Epi&s;copalians <HI>are allowed the &s;ame Liberty with all other Per&s;ua&s;i|ons, and do, with as much Freedom from Mole&s;tati|on, wor&s;hip God in the preci&s;e Way they them&s;elves are plea&s;ed to chu&s;e,</HI> p. 97. But can he be &s;erious when he &s;ays this? Or does he mean to in&s;ult us? Is it <HI>the Truth,</HI> that we <HI>have the &s;ame Liberty with all other Per&s;u&s;ions</HI>? Do they not all enjoy their own religious Sy&s;tems compleatly, and in every Part? But can this be predicated of the Church of <HI>England?</HI> We complain that we are de&s;titute of the Power of Ordination, and are not allowed to enjoy &s;everal of the In&s;titutions of our Church, which we hold in great E&s;teem and Veneration: The Doctor an&s;wers that we wor&s;hip God in our own Way without Mole&s;tation. But does this An&s;|wer come up to the Complaint? Did we ever pre|tend that the Privilege of wor&s;hiping God, ac|cording to the Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> was refu&s;ed us? Does our Enjoyment of this Pri|vilege prove, that we are not under tho&s;e peculiar Di&s;advantages which the Complaint &s;pecifies? And if we are under Di&s;advantages which are peculiar to our&s;elves, and from which all other Denomina|tions are free, having all of them the full U&s;e of their re&s;pective Forms of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline
<PB N="154" REF="011203_0164_0F95324EAEF08678">
and Government, have we not Rea&s;on to complain that we ONLY are not permitted the U&s;e of ours? Why &s;hould there be this glaring Di&s;tinction? Where our Claims are, at lea&s;t, equal with tho&s;e of our Neighbours, why &s;hould a Difference be made in their Favour?</P>
<P><HI>ALL the Difference,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>is, our Principles do not hamper us with tho&s;e objected Diffi|culties, their's expo&s;e them to.</HI> With equal Candour and Propriety it might have been &s;aid, by the Mem|bers of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, <HI>in the Days of tho&s;e hard-hearted Archbi&s;hops Parker, Bancroft, Whit|gift and Laud:</HI> Why do the&s;e Puritants complain? Are they not treated upon the &s;ame Footing with our&s;elves? <HI>We know of nothing that has been grant|ed to</HI> us or <HI>others, but what is equally granted to them: All the Difference is, our Principles do not hamper us with tho&s;e objected Difficulties, their's ex|po&s;e them to.</HI> And this the greate&s;t Per&s;ecutors that ever exi&s;ted may have as pertinently &s;aid, of tho&s;e whom they harra&s;&s;ed and put to the Torture&mdash; they are only <HI>hampered</HI> by their own Principles, and they may thank them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I MEET with nothing farther that is worthy of Notice, untill we come to the concluding Para|graph of this <HI>Section,</HI> in p. 100, where I am charg|ed with having been ungrateful and undutiful. My <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> it &s;eems, con&s;i&s;ts in uttering Com|plaints,
<Q>in Behalf of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>America,</HI></Q>
after <HI>Thirty Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling,</HI> have been expended in <HI>England to promote its Growth.</HI> But by whom has this Sum been ex|pended? Not by the Nation, but by a particular Society. I know not that the Nation has ever been at any con&s;iderable Expence, to promote
<PB N="155" REF="011203_0165_0F9532508FF0EAD8">
the Growth of the Church in the Colonies; and as this was not expected, &s;o their not doing it has never been mentioned as Matter of Complaint. But what we complain of is, that the national Re|ligion in the Colonies has not been made the Object of greater national Attention, in &s;ome other Re&s;|pects; and particularly, that &s;uch Relief has not been given it, as it was known greatly to &s;uffer for the Want of and as might have ea&s;ily been granted, without any public Expence. So much, we think, we had Rea&s;on to expect; and I can &s;ee nothing unbecoming or improper in the Complaint. If I had complained of <HI>the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel,</HI> the Doctor then might ju&s;tly have branded me with Ingratitude. Our great Bene|factors are the worthy Members of that Society; it is they who have expended the large Sums for the Support and Promotion of the Church here, which the Doctor has &s;een fit to transfer from their, to the national Account. But we &s;hall always remember that it is to them, that our Gratitude is immediately due; and if the lea&s;t Symptom of Ingratitude to that venerable Body can be di&s;covered in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> I hereby promi&s;e, that I will never attempt any far|ther <HI>Defence</HI> of it.</P>
<P>AS to the other Charge of <HI>Undutifulne&s;s,</HI> it is made out in this Manner. <HI>It lies with the King,</HI> whether we &s;hall have Bi&s;hops or not; therefore to complain of the Want of Bi&s;hops, is to reflect upon the King; and to reflect upon the King is un|dutiful. The Author of the <HI>Appeal</HI> has com|plained of the Want of Bi&s;hops: <HI>Ergo,</HI> the Au|thor of the <HI>Appeal</HI> has been undutiful to the King. <HI>I could wi&s;h,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>he had expre&s;&s;ed more dutiful Reverence towards his Sovereign, than
<PB N="156" REF="011203_0166_0F953250F0850158">
to charge him as he does</HI> VIRTUALLY <HI>and in Reality of Con&s;truction, with treating the Church here with unparalleled Hard&s;hip,</HI> &amp;c. I a&s;&s;ure the Doctor, it gives me the utmo&s;t Plea&s;ure to find him &s;o zea|lous for maintaining a <HI>dutiful Reverence towards</HI> our mo&s;t gracious <HI>Sovereign,</HI> and &s;o ready to bear Te&s;timony again&s;t every Thing that appears, <HI>vir|tually and in Reality of Con&s;truction,</HI> to reflect upon his &s;acred Per&s;on. Let me tell him however, that he is probably &s;omewhat mi&s;taken, with Regard to the Matter before us. It has been all along &s;up|po&s;ed and believed, that the Want of an <HI>American</HI> Epi&s;copate has not been owing to any Backward|ne&s;s in our Kings to grant it, but to the Neglect of others, who&s;e Duty it was to prepare the Way for &s;uch an Appointment. The Complaint can be a Reflection on tho&s;e only, who have neglected their Duty; but as our Kings appear not to have been negligent of theirs, it is no Reflection upon them: &mdash;Much le&s;s, upon our pre&s;ent mo&s;t excellent Sove|reign, who has conde&s;cended to expre&s;s him&s;elf on the Subject, in the mo&s;t obliging Terms, and in who&s;e favourable Di&s;po&s;ition we have an intire Confidence.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the King <HI>can,</HI> as the Doctor ob|&s;erves, by Virtue of that Supremacy which the Con&s;titution allows him, grant an <HI>American</HI> Epi&s;|copate at any Time; yet a wi&s;e King will not choo&s;e, and his real Friends will not de&s;ire him, to exert this Prerogative, until the Way is duly prepared, and there is a rational Pro&s;pect of its an&s;wering the Purpo&s;e. In Order to this, it has been thought requi&s;ite, even by our CONVENTION, as zealous as it has been, &s;till is, and I tru&s;t will be, in the Pro|&s;ecution of this Plan, that the Nature of the pro|jected Epi&s;copate &s;hould be fully under&s;tood, and
<PB N="157" REF="011203_0167_0F953251AE472718">
<HI>generally</HI> approved of, by the various Denomina|tions of People in <HI>America.</HI> And it is one good Effect of the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y, for which I now return Thanks to my Opponents, that our Plan has been more attentively con&s;idered, and more fully under&s;tood: Another is, that it has produced &s;uch Te&s;timonies of Approbation as were wanted. It was indeed always believed the Di&s;&s;enters would not object to our having &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are propo&s;ed for <HI>America</HI>; but we had no public Declarations that tho&s;e of the Pre&s;byterian or Congregational Per&s;ua&s;ion approved of our Plan, until Dr. <HI>Chaun|cy</HI> and the <HI>American Whig,</HI> who have appeared in their Behalf on the Occa&s;ion, were plea&s;ed to make them. The&s;e Writers, it is true, &s;till object, in their Names, again&s;t an <HI>American</HI> Epi&s;copate, &s;uppo&s;ing it may be different from what has been pretended and explained to the Public. But as to the Epi&s;copate really intended, concerning which alone their Opinion was de&s;ired, they have clearly expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, and &s;aid as much in Favour of it as could be rea&s;onably expected. So that now, whatever may be the Fate of particular Parts or Pa&s;&s;ages of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> the great and immediate De&s;ign of it has &s;ucceeded, and the Author has no Rea&s;on to repent of his having undertaken it.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. V.</NOTE>THE Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>fifth</HI> Section of the <HI>Ap|peal,</HI> is to a&s;&s;ign Rea&s;ons why the Church in <HI>America</HI> has been &s;o long neglected. The Doctor confe&s;&s;es he has <HI>no Concern with the immediate Con|tents of it:</HI> However, there are &s;ome <HI>Matters of Intelligence,</HI> it &s;eems, intermixed with the Rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned, which he thinks worthy of his Animad|ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;age that di&s;turbs him is the fol|lowing:
<Q>The Colonies were generally &s;ettled by private Adventurers; and &s;ome of them by tho&s;e who had an Aver&s;ion to epi&s;copal Government. The Propriety of not &s;ending a Bi&s;hop to Co|lonies of the latter Sort, will be di&s;puted by none</Q>
(<HI>Appeal</HI> p. 47.) He does not attempt to &s;hew that this Ob&s;ervation is unju&s;t, or improper, or imper|tinent; but yet he &s;peaks of it as no more than <HI>a Rattle to plea&s;e Children with,</HI> and then a&s;ks a Number of Que&s;tions relating to <HI>New-England,</HI> which are not at all to the Purpo&s;e, but upon the Suppo&s;ition that there are, at this Day, no Epi&s;|copalians in tho&s;e Colonies. For what I had ad|vanced was this, that the Propriety of not &s;ending Bi&s;hops to tho&s;e who had an Aver&s;ion to epi&s;copal Government, is indi&s;putable. Let us try notwith|&s;tanding, whether any Thing can be made of his Que&s;tions and Remarks, however foreign or out of Place. <HI>Que&s;t. If a Bi&s;hop is &s;ent, will he have

nothing to do in the&s;e</HI> the <HI>New-England Colonies? An&s;.</HI> Nothing at all, but with &s;uch Per&s;ons as &s;hall be de&s;irous of his Admini&s;trations. <HI>Que&s;t. Will they not be Part of his Dioce&s;s? An&s;.</HI> Not in &s;uch a Sen&s;e, as to bring the Di&s;&s;enters under his Juri&s;diction. <HI>Que&s;t.

An&s;.</HI> They mo&s;t certainly will; but this can do no Harm to him, or any others of the <HI>Congregational or Pre&s;byterian Per&s;ua&s;ion. He will then,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>be as compleatly &s;ettled at the Head of the epi&s;copal Clergy, within the&s;e Bounds, as in the other Colonies, and will have the &s;ame Right of &s;u|perintending and governing them.</HI> Very true; but why &s;hould not the epi&s;copal Clergy of <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> be &s;uperintended and governed, as well as tho&s;e of the other Colonies? They do not de&s;ire to be exempted them&s;elves, and it never has been propo&s;ed by others. But attend then to the Con|&s;equence: <HI>If his</HI> (the Bi&s;hop's) <HI>Place of Re&s;idence &s;hould not be here,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>his Power will: And it will be the &s;ame in all its Exerci&s;es, as in any other of the Provinces.</HI> But if the <HI>Exerci&s;es</HI> of <HI>his Power</HI> are to be confined to the epi&s;copal Clergy, other People, as has been ob&s;erved, need not be anxious, whether even <HI>the Place of his Re&s;idence</HI> &s;hould be in <HI>New-England,</HI> or not. It is really &s;urprizing to find a Man of Sen&s;e and Reputation caviling at this Rate&mdash;re&s;olved to be &s;atisfied with nothing&mdash;at one Time blaming us, becau&s;e, under the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate, no peculiar Power is to be exerci&s;ed over the Laity&mdash;at another, finding Fault that it is to be exerci&s;ed over the epi&s;copal Clergy&mdash;and then peevi&s;hly declaring that a Bi&s;hop, as odious and dete&s;table as he is, may as well re&s;ide in <HI>New-England</HI> altogether, as &s;uperintend and govern the

Clergy belonging to the Church. Such invincible Prejudice is hardly to be met with in the pre&s;ent Age. It reminds me of an In&s;tance in ancient Hi&s;tory:

<P>THE next Piece of <HI>Intelligence</HI> the Doctor takes in Hand, relates to the Endeavours of <HI>the Society</HI> to obtain an Epi&s;copate for the Church in <HI>America.</HI> But I find not that he is able to &s;ay much again&s;t it, or to infer much from it. I &s;at down to write this <HI>Defence,</HI> with a determined Re&s;olution to treat Doctor <HI>Chauncy</HI> with all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;pect. Hitherto I have adhered to it with great Firmne&s;s and Punc|tuality, and have taken Notice of many Things, which I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed over as unworthy of Ob&s;ervation, in many other Writers. But as I think it high Time to &s;hew &s;ome Re&s;pect al&s;o to the Reader, the good Doctor will excu&s;e me, if here|after he &s;hould not find me &s;o minutely attentive to him, as I have been. Every Thing however in the &s;ucceeding Parts of his Performance, that ap|pears to me to have either of the two Qualities, Weight or Plau&s;ibility, &s;hall be duly noticed.</P>
<P><HI>THE la&s;t Article of Intelligence,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>relates to the external Circum&s;tances of the Bi&s;hop that is de&s;ired to be &s;ent to</HI> America. <HI>A Seat has been purcha&s;ed for his Re&s;idence, at</HI> Six Hundred Pounds, <HI>Sterling, Ex|pence, in a convenient Man&s;ion-Hou&s;e and Lands, &s;itu|ate at</HI> Burlington, <HI>in the</HI> Jer&s;ies; and large Legacies have been left for the Support of an <HI>American</HI>

Epi&s;copate, p. 104. This is the Sub&s;tance of the Intelligence. Let us now attend to the U&s;e that is made of it. <HI>It is,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>unque&s;tionable, if a Bi&s;hop is &s;ent to</HI> America, <HI>that &s;uch Provi&s;ion mu&s;t be made for his Support, as will enable him to appear in all the Grandeur of a Bi&s;hop in</HI> England. <HI>The Place of his Re&s;idence</HI> (does he mean the City of <HI>Burlington?) and Manner of living, mu&s;t exceed a common Clergyman's in Proportion to his more exalted Station in the Church,</HI> p. 105. If &pound;. 600 Sterling laid out in the Purcha&s;e of a <HI>Man&s;ion-Hou&s;e and Lands,</HI> for an <HI>American</HI> Bi&s;hop, excites in the Doctor the Idea of Grandeur and Magnificence, it will probably have a contrary Effect in the Minds of other Per&s;ons. There are &s;everal In&s;tances in <HI>America</HI> of <HI>Man&s;ion-Hou&s;es and Lands,</HI> or, in other Words, of Par&s;onage Hou&s;es and Glebes, which could not be purcha&s;ed for twice the Sum; and I believe that there are but few <HI>epi&s;copal Palaces</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> even exclu&s;ive of their <HI>Regalia</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>American Whig,</HI> Numb.

So that it does not follow from the above <HI>Intel|ligence,</HI> that with Re&s;pect to the Article of his <HI>Man&s;ion-Hou&s;e,</HI> the <HI>American</HI> Bi&s;hop is likely <HI>to ap|pear in all the Grandeur of a Bi&s;hop in England,</HI> or va&s;tly to exceed in Appearance &s;ome <HI>common Cler|gymen.</HI> Perhaps the intended Grandeur of the <HI>Ame|rican</HI> Bi&s;hops is infered, from the large Sums that have been given for their Support. But until it be known how many Bi&s;hops are to be thereby &s;up|ported, and how much each is to receive, the Infe|rence is not conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>AFTER all, why &s;hould not a Bi&s;hop be &s;up|ported, <HI>in Proportion to his more exalted Station in the Church?</HI> Is it not agreeable to the common
<PB N="162" REF="011203_0172_0F9532556E416A58">
Sen&s;e of Mankind, and to the Fitne&s;s of Things, that Men in eminent Stations &s;hould be enabled to make a greater external Appearance, than others of an inferior Degree? Ought not every Office to be re&s;pected, according to its Dignity and Impor|tance? And is not the general Temper and Di&s;po|&s;ition of Mankind &s;uch, that Re&s;pect will be paid to an Office, in &s;ome Degree of Proportion to its out|ward Figure and Appendages? And is not this in Reality the Ca&s;e, with Re&s;pect to eccle&s;ia&s;tical Offices, as well as to any other? It ought farther to be con|&s;idered, that the nece&s;&s;ary Expences of a Bi&s;hop greatly exceed tho&s;e of a common Clergyman. A Bi&s;hop ought, in a peculiar Manner, to be
<Q>given to Ho&s;pitality.</Q>
He ought eminently to di&s;tin|gui&s;h him&s;elf by Works of Charity. The&s;e Things will certainly be expected from him; and how can &s;uch Expectations be an&s;wered, unle&s;s a more am|ple Provi&s;ion be made for him, than is requi&s;ite for common Clergymen?</P>
<P>BUT <HI>&s;uch Bi&s;hops were unknown in the Chri&s;tian World, in its fir&s;t Days of Purity.</HI> This is not di&s;puted, with Regard to their external Circum|&s;tances; and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of the Clergy in general. In tho&s;e Days there was perhaps not an In&s;tance, of a Clergyman &s;o comfortably &s;ituated and &s;o well accommodated, as I &s;uppo&s;e Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> to be in <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> Now what are we to infer from this? That the Doctor's Pari&s;hioners have done wrong, in providing for him &s;uch <HI>un-primitive</HI> Accommo|dations? Or, that he does wrong in accepting, and making U&s;e of them? Can it be thought the Duty of Bi&s;hops and Clergymen, at this Day, to court "Stripes and Impri&s;onments," becau&s;e they were inflicted on the Apo&s;tles and fir&s;t Mini&s;ters of the
<PB N="163" REF="011203_0173_0F9532562E4039A8">
Chri&s;tian Religion? Or is it the Duty only of Bi|&s;hops, and not of the common Clergy and private Chri&s;tians, to be in the&s;e <HI>primitive</HI> Circum&s;tances? One would be apt to infer this, from &s;ome Men's Rea&s;onings; &s;o glaring is their Partiality again&s;t the epi&s;copal Order. <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo&s;tate, as was ob&s;erved to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e by Archbi&s;hop <HI>Whit|gift,</HI> in Excu&s;e for &s;ome of the Arts he had u&s;ed to undermine and de&s;troy Chri&s;tianity,
<Q>&s;aid in De|ri&s;ion, he did that which was mo&s;t meet and pro|fitable for Chri&s;tians, viz. That they being made poor, might &s;ooner come to the Kingdom of Heaven: Seeing the Go&s;pel promi&s;eth the King|dom of Heaven to tho&s;e that be poor, and that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;aith, that none can be his Di&s;cples, un|le&s;s they for&s;ake all, and follow him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strype</HI>'s Life of <HI>Whitgift,</HI> p. 215.</NOTE>.</Q>
I do not accu&s;e the Doctor, of having the &s;ame inveterate Enmity again&s;t our Bi&s;hops, that <HI>Julian</HI> had again&s;t Chri&s;tians in general; but in &s;ome Appearances there is a &s;triking Re&s;emblance. And in Con&s;ide|ration of that Example, it may not be ami&s;s in him to examine, whether what he has offered in the like Strain, be not the Dictate of Prejudice or &s;ome evil Pa&s;&s;ion, rather than of real and impartial Judgment.</P>
<P>I KNOW very well that the Go&s;pel requires of Bi&s;hops, and it as indi&s;pen&s;ably requires of all o|thers, not to hold Hou&s;es, or Lands, or any world|ly Enjoyments when they come into Competition with a good Con&s;cience: And every Bi&s;hop who does not choo&s;e to part with them, rather than to deny, or for&s;ake, or di&s;obey Chri&s;t, is utterly un|worthy of the venerable Character. But the Go&s;pel requires not of its Di&s;ciples, not even of Bi&s;hops, to renounce the temperate Enjoyment of the&s;e
<PB N="164" REF="011203_0174_0F953256ED1DF128">
Things, excepting when particular Rea&s;ons make it nece&s;&s;ary. It allows us to po&s;&s;e&s;s
<Q>this World's Goods,</Q>
when they can be obtained hone&s;tly; it teaches us to con&s;ider them as the Gifts of Hea|ven, and to be thankful for them on that Account, cautioning us only &s;o to <HI>u&s;e,</HI> as not to <HI>abu&s;e,</HI> them. And what it makes a Rule for any, it injoins upon all Men, without any Di&s;tinction of Per&s;ons or Characters.</P>
<P><HI>NOR do we read of &s;uch Bi&s;hops,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>until Chri&s;tians had gro&s;sly departed from that Simpli|city of living, which was their primitive Glory.</HI> In a State of Per&s;ecution, nothing more than what is here called <HI>Simplicity of living,</HI> can be expected; and where it is &s;ubmitted to for the Sake of a good Con&s;cience, as it was by the primitive Chri&s;tians, it is undoubtedly Men's <HI>Glory.</HI> That Chri&s;tians, in general, in this Age, have too far departed from a decent Simplicity of Manners, and are too apt to indulge them&s;elves in exce&s;&s;ive Luxury, is not to be denied, and ought to be lamented. All Orders of Men &s;eem to be infected with this epidemical Evil, and it is to be feared, even that the Bi&s;hops and Clergy have not altogether e&s;caped the Infec|tion; and they, in particular, ought to make it their Study to recover them&s;elves, and all whom they can per&s;uade. But that Nations now ought &s;trictly to regulate their Manners and Mode of living, by the Cu&s;toms of any former Age, I do not believe; and if Individuals &s;hould attempt it, it would an&s;wer no good End, and they would appear ridiculous. The primitive Chri&s;tians, for In&s;tance, had no Gla&s;s-Windows in their Hou&s;es; and we are under as &s;trong Obligations to adopt their <HI>Simplicity of Living</HI> in this Re&s;pect, as in many
<PB N="165" REF="011203_0175_0F953258E3E00D30">
others. The Bi&s;hops in the primitive Church were very differently &s;ituated, from what Bi&s;hops now are in the Church of <HI>England</HI>; but it does not ap|pear, that, in Ca&s;e the civil Powers had been di&s;|po&s;ed to be&s;tow upon them the like Favours, with tho&s;e which are enjoyed by <HI>our</HI> Bi&s;hops, that they would have been unwilling to accept them. On the other Hand, it does appear, from repeated Trials, that many of our Bi&s;hops have been as ready to give up, and &s;acrifice, all their worldly Advantages, when their Duty required it, as any Bi&s;hops in the primitive Church.</P>
<P><HI>AT &s;o great a Di&s;tance from apo&s;tolic Times,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>as the third Century, tho' Corruption had then crept into the Church,</HI> Paul <HI>of</HI> Samo&s;ata, <HI>Bi&s;hop of</HI> Antioch, <HI>was depo&s;ed, among other Things for this,</HI>
<Q>that having been poor before he was a Bi&s;hop, he had after that grown very rich, born &s;ecular Dignities, pa&s;&s;ed the Streets with a Train of Attendants, and erected to him&s;elf a magnificent Seat in the Church.</Q>
&mdash;For which <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> is quoted, p. 105. The Epi&s;tle of the Council of <HI>Antioch,</HI> partly given by <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> in the Place refered to, does not &s;ay that <HI>Paul</HI> was depo&s;ed, among other Things, for having been <HI>very rich</HI>; but it charges him with having ama&s;&s;ed incredible Wealth <HI>unju&s;tly,</HI> by Oppre&s;&s;ion and Sacrilege. For want of Greek Types, I mu&s;t produce to the Rea|der the Latin Tran&s;lation by <HI>Vale&s;ius,</HI>
<Q><HI>Nunc ad incredibilem Opulentiam pervenit, per Scelera ac Sacrilegia, Fratrumque Concu&s;&s;iones: dum Injurid affectos decipit, promittens quidem &s;e&s;e illis accepta mercede Opem laturum: fallens autem ip&s;os, et ex Facilitate litigantium, qui ut negotio liberentur, quidvis dare parati &s;unt, Lucrum inaniter captans,

The Com|plaint goes on &s;pecifying, not barely that he had <HI>born &s;ecular Dignities,</HI> but that he had born them with unbounded Pride and In&s;olence:
<Q>Neque quod Fa&s;tu et Arrogantia &s;upra Modum elatus &s;aeculares gerit Dignitates</Q>
&mdash;not &s;imply that he had <HI>pa&s;&s;ed the Streets with a Train of Attendants,</HI> but that in thus pa&s;&s;ing the Streets, he had di&s;co|vered un&s;ufferable Arrogance and Di&s;dain, to the Di&s;grace of the Chri&s;tian Religion:&mdash;
<Q>Stipatu&s;que maxima Hominum Multitudine, partim praeeun|tium, partim &s;ub&s;equentium; adeo ut illius Fa&s;tu et Arrogantia incredibilis Invidia odiumque multo|rum adver&s;us Fidem no&s;tram conflatum &s;it.</Q>
In &s;hort, he is here repre&s;ented by the Council, to have been the greate&s;t Mon&s;ter for Wickedne&s;s, that ever di&s;graced the Chri&s;tian Church; and I am very cer|tain, that a Bi&s;hop of his Character in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> at this Day, would not be puni&s;hed with le&s;s Severity, than this Bi&s;hop was in the <HI>Third</HI> Century. Nor do I believe that the Council of <HI>Antioch</HI> condemn|ed any Thing in his Character or Conduct, but what would be as loudly condemned in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Convoca|tion. It is evident therefore, upon the whole, that this In&s;tance will not an&s;wer the Purpo&s;e for which it is quoted.</P>
<P>The Doctor proceeds: <HI>A good while after this, though the Church had grown &s;till more corrupt, the Fourth Council of</HI> Carthage <HI>decreed,</HI>
<Q>That the Bi&s;hop &s;hall have a little Dwelling-Hou&s;e near the Church; that he &s;hall have coar&s;e hou&s;e-hold Stuff and Diet, and &s;eek his Reputation only by &s;ound Doctrine, and a good Life; that he &s;hall not &s;pend his Time in caring for his Family, but be employed wholly in reading, praying and
<PB N="167" REF="011203_0177_0F953259EE56A008">
preaching the Word of God,</Q>
p. 106. Some Part of what is here decreed, is very commendable. A Bi&s;hop ought undoubtedly to apply him&s;elf <HI>chiefly</HI> to the proper Duties of his Function. He ought to avoid every Appearance of a vain Extra|vagance, and of an undue Attachment to the Plea|&s;ures, the Honours, and Intere&s;ts of the World. But that he &s;hould literally be confined to mean Diet, coar&s;e Furniture, and a &s;mall Hou&s;e, if Piety or Genero&s;ity have provided for him better, no unbia&s;&s;ed Per&s;on can think nece&s;&s;ary. And &s;o again, if he is to have no Regard at all to the Welfare and Intere&s;ts of his Family, he mu&s;t act an unnatural Part, and become, according to the Apo&s;tle's E&s;timation, "wor&s;e than an Infidel." Nor is it nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould never concern him&s;elf in publick Affairs, as, of late, we have &s;een it frequently a&s;&s;erted.
<Q>Mu&s;t a Per&s;on who knows well the Intere&s;t of his Country, and is capable of &s;erving it, be &s;ilent only becau&s;e he is a Mini&s;ter (<HI>or a Bi&s;hop?</HI>) Is he nothing el&s;e? Is he not a Subject of his Prince, and a Member of the Common-wealth?&mdash;Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> was full of the Sentiments of the Rev. Doctors <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> and <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> his Pa&s;tors and Predece&s;&s;ors, on this Head&mdash;viz.

It is evident from hence, that this Council had run far into an Extreme with Regard to the Clergy in gene|ral, as well as to Bi&s;hops; &s;o that no Example or In&s;truction taken from thence, can be of much Weight in any modern Controver&s;y. If the Canons of this Council relating to Bi&s;hops ought to be re|garded, why not as well tho&s;e that relate to the inferior Clergy?

<P>THE Extracts from <HI>Cranmer</HI> and <HI>Hooper,</HI> with which we are next pre&s;ented, if properly under|&s;tood, are not incon&s;i&s;tent with any Thing for which we contend.

This general Propo&s;ition is unque&s;tionably true, but what Inference are we to make from it? Not, that all Men &s;hould be re|duced to the &s;ame Level, but that tho&s;e Per&s;ons who are thus &s;ituated &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible of this Danger, and guard again&s;t it.

<P>WHEN the <HI>Appeal to the Public</HI> was drawn up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. VI.</NOTE> it was apprehended that the Time was peculiarly favourable to an Application for an <HI>Ame|rican</HI> Epi&s;copate; the Rea&s;ons for which Appre|hen&s;ion were a&s;&s;igned and explained in SECT. VI, and are as follow:
<Q>The Tumults of War have cea&s;ed, and the public Tranquility is re&s;tored, without any rea&s;onable &s;u&s;picions of a &s;peedy In|terruption&mdash;the greate&s;t Harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ts be|tween our Mother-Country and mo&s;t of the Co|lonies&mdash;the Plan of an <HI>American</HI> Epi&s;copate has been previou&s;ly &s;ettled and adju&s;ted in &s;uch a Manner, that the religious Privileges of none can be violated or endangered&mdash;and, which we &s;hould ever acknowledge with all Thankfulne&s;s, we are, at this Time, &s;o happy as to have a Prince on the Throne, from who&s;e mo&s;t unque&s;|tionable Di&s;po&s;ition to promote the general In|tere&s;ts of Virtue and Religion, from who&s;e &s;incere Affection for the Church, and from who&s;e mo&s;t gracious Declarations on the Subject before us, we cannot po&s;&s;ibly doubt of the Royal Appro|bation and Concurrence.</Q></P>
<P>IT is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of an <HI>An&s;werer</HI> to &s;hew, that the&s;e Circum&s;tances of the Public were not <HI>then</HI> real, but imaginary; or that they were not, in Rea&s;on, to be looked upon as favorable to &s;uch an Application, or el&s;e candidly to confe&s;s the Force and Propriety of the Repre&s;entation. Dr.
<PB N="172" REF="011203_0182_0F95325DADD8B990">
<HI>Chauncy</HI> thinks fit to di&s;pute the <HI>Reality</HI> of tho&s;e favourable Appearances, in the Sen&s;e wherein it is maintained in the APPEAL. He does not indeed deny that the Tumults of War were then cea&s;ed, but &s;hrewdly a&s;ks, <HI>was this never the Ca&s;e before?</HI> This Que&s;tion alludes to the introductory Ob&s;er|vation,
<Q>that the favourable Opportunity&mdash;was &s;uch, in <HI>&s;everal</HI> Re&s;pects, as the Circum&s;tances of the Nation had never, until then, afforded.</Q>
But it was not pretended that the Temple of the <HI>Briti&s;h Janus</HI> had never been before &s;hut, nor that the favourable Opportunity was, in every Re&s;pect, without a Precedent. He goes on: <HI>Are there no rea|&s;onable Su&s;picions of a &s;peedy Interruption of the pre&s;ent Tranquility?</HI> The Que&s;tion, ought not to have been put in the <HI>pre&s;ent Ten&s;e.</HI> The <HI>Appeal</HI> was drawn up in <HI>February</HI> 1767, and the Doctor wrote in the Beginning of 1768, it being about a Year afterwards; within which Time the Appearance of public Affairs was greatly changed. And I can a&s;|&s;ure him, that, whatever Alarms of a <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> War had reached him and impre&s;&s;ed his Imagination at the Time of <HI>an&s;wering,</HI> I neither &s;aw nor heard of any Appearances of &s;uch a Thing at the Time of <HI>writing.</HI> With Regard to the
<Q>Harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between our Mother-Coun|try and mo&s;t of the Colonies,</Q>
the Doctor &s;ays: <HI>It is true the Di&s;pute relative to the</HI> STAMP-ACT, <HI>has been happily terminated. But has nothing inter|vened &s;ince, that has di&s;turbed the Harmony?</HI> If he will be plea&s;ed to review the Chronology of <HI>the doings at Home</HI> which relate to the Colonies, he will find that in the Beginning of 1767, we knew here of nothing that had intervened, after the happy Ter|mination of the great Di&s;pute about the STAMP-ACT, which had the lea&s;t Tendency to di&s;turb our Har|mony.
<PB N="173" REF="011203_0183_0F95325E6CC63FF0">
Indeed before the <HI>Appeal</HI> was printed, it was found that the Mother-Country had expre&s;&s;ed her Re&s;entment of the Proceedings of one of our provincial A&s;&s;emblies; and this occa&s;ioned a &s;mall Alteration to be made in the Copy, <HI>mo&s;t of the Co|lonies</HI> being in&s;erted, in&s;tead of, <HI>the Colonies.</HI> The Doctor has &s;ome Declamation under this Que&s;tion, which as it is founded on a Mi&s;take, I can readily excu&s;e.</P>
<P>AS to the Plan for <HI>American</HI> Bi&s;hops, according to which the religious Privileges of all Denominati|ons are to be left untouched, the Doctor has the Curio&s;ity to inquire: <HI>By whom has this Plan been &s;ettled and adju&s;ted?</HI> And then adds, <HI>we have no good Rea&s;on to think that it has been done by tho&s;e who have any con&s;titutional Right to meddle, of their own meer Motion, with Matters of this Nature.</HI> This Subject will come more properly under Con|&s;ideration afterwards; in the mean while, I will give him this general Information, that the Plan for &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as is explained in the <HI>Ap|peal,</HI> was &s;ettled by tho&s;e who were warranted by a Royal Commi&s;&s;ion con&s;titutionally i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>AS to the King's favorable Di&s;po&s;ition, from which we have &s;uch Expectations of Relief, the Doctor thinks it will do us no Service. <HI>We can,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>chearfully rely on the impartial Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s of the Briti&s;h Sovereign, not in the lea&s;t doubting his equal paternal Regard to all his loyal Coloni&s;ts of whatever Cla&s;s.</HI> And may not the Mem|bers of the Church of <HI>England</HI> rely upon him, as well as others? Will <HI>impartial Ju&s;tice and Good|ne&s;s</HI> be partial again&s;t the Church? Will not the <HI>equal Regard</HI> of our Sovereign, at length rai&s;e us
<PB N="174" REF="011203_0184_0F95326120295A48">
to that Equality with our Fellow-Coloni&s;ts, which alone we reque&s;t? Will not a <HI>paternal Regard to loyal Coloni&s;ts</HI> rai&s;e tho&s;e Coloni&s;ts, who&s;e Loyalty has been unimpeached, and which it is hoped will be able to &s;tand every Trial, from the Condition of Aliens into that of Sons? How unkind and un|generous is it to tell us of our <HI>Equality,</HI> when the World &s;ees that our Condition is cruelly <HI>unequal!</HI></P>
<P>AS the Concurrence of many peculiar Circum|&s;tances was apprehended to be favorable to the Scheme of an Epi&s;copate in the Colonies, &s;o it was ob&s;erved in the <HI>Appeal,</HI>
<Q>that the Arguments for &s;ending Bi&s;hops to <HI>America,</HI> were never &s;o &s;trong and forcible as they are at pre&s;ent.</Q>
Under this Head, the Number of tho&s;e who belong to the <HI>A|merican</HI> Church of <HI>England,</HI> and who will receive Benefit from this Appointment, was particularly in&s;i&s;ted on. This Number was intimated to be NEAR A MILLION. The Writers again&s;t the <HI>Ap|peal,</HI> particularly Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> and the <HI>Centinel,</HI> have exerted them&s;elves to prove, that the Account is aggravated beyond the Bounds of Truth and Pro|bability; and, in my private Opinion, the mo&s;t plau&s;ible Things that have been written again&s;t any Part of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> have been offered on this Subject. It may therefore be proper to lay before the Reader the Evidence upon which the Expre&s;&s;ion was grounded.</P>
<P>IF any one will take the Trouble to turn to the <HI>Appeal,</HI> p. 55, he will find, that any exact Cer|tainty as to the Number of Church-Men in <HI>America</HI> was not pretended to; &s;o far from it, that it was expre&s;sly acknowledged,
<Q>that in a Country &s;o widely extended and unequally peopled,</Q>
it was not to be expected. However, as it had been frequent|ly
<PB N="175" REF="011203_0185_0F9532617403FAA0">
&s;aid by our mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Writers, and was report|ed to have been a&s;&s;umed as Fact in the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that the King's proper Subjects in <HI>America</HI> amounted to THREE MILLIONS; it was thought that the A&s;&s;ertion,
<Q>that the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>America</HI> contains now <HI>near a Million</HI> of Members,</Q>
might be ju&s;tified on the Ground of that general A&s;&s;umption. At the Time of writing, I had Rea&s;on to believe, and am &s;till of Opinion, that tho&s;e who profe&s;s them&s;elves to belong to the Church of <HI>England</HI> in the <HI>American</HI> Colonies and I&s;lands, are not le&s;s than a <HI>third</HI> Part of the Inha|bitants, <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> of the <HI>Blacks</HI>; and I had Arith|metic enough to know, that a third Part of what was a&s;&s;igned as the whole Number, was <HI>one Million.</HI> But as I &s;u&s;pected that the general Number was exaggerated, an Abatement was made on the Side of the Church, and it was intimated that the Mem|bers of it amounted, not to a full Million, but to <HI>near a Million.</HI> Now this, I imagine, might be &s;aid, not improperly, after a Deduction of 500,000, from the Sum total as currently received, a third Part of which would be upwards of 833,000: And this was actually the very Number that I had in View. And wherever the Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>near a Million</HI> has been applied to the Number of <HI>American</HI> Church-Men, by the Clergy of our Con|vention, it has been upon the &s;ame View and Principle.</P>
<P>MY continuing to u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion, after hav|ing &s;een the Account of an actual Survey &s;aid to have been made in 1762, which was mentioned in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> p. 56, remains to be accounted for. The Number of Inhabitants expre&s;&s;ed in that Ac|count, of which I knew no more than that a Gen|tleman
<PB N="176" REF="011203_0186_0F9532622E4B7C78">
of Credit told me it had been carefully taken, fell &s;hort of my Expectations, it making the Members of the Church, not including the Blacks, to be no more at the Time of the Survey, than between Four and Five Hundred Thou&s;and. But then it was con&s;idered, that the <HI>Americans</HI> are found to double their Numbers in 25 Years in the Cour&s;e of natural Generation&mdash;that five Years had elap&s;ed &s;ince the Survey was &s;aid to have been made, and con&s;equently that a fifth Part of the whole was to be added to the Number, that the Account included not the Colonies lately ceded, in which there are probably &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Church-Men&mdash;that a farther yearly Addition had been made by the coming over of <HI>Europeans,</HI> and, as &s;ome think, by Pro&s;elytes from the Di&s;&s;enters &mdash;and that of the Blacks, not le&s;s than 600,000 mu&s;t be the Property of Epi&s;copalians, of which Number it was conjectured that about a fourth Part might be &s;aid properly to belong to the Church: I &s;ay, the above Particulars being con&s;i|dered, I was of Opinion that the Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>near a Million,</HI> might &s;till be retained, con&s;i&s;tently with the Account of the actual Survey.</P>
<P>SOME of my Opponents have affected to be witty upon what was &s;aid of the Blacks, ridiculing the Notion of their being Members of the Church. But, with Regard to the Admi&s;&s;ion of Members, the Church of <HI>England,</HI> like the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, makes no Di&s;tinction of <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Greek,</HI> Bond or Free, Black or White; and we are not a&s;hamed to confe&s;s, that many of tho&s;e who are doomed to Slavery, and upon who&s;e Necks we have fa&s;tened the Yoke of Bondage, are Members of the &s;ame religious Society with our&s;elves. Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> &s;ays
<PB N="177" REF="011203_0187_0F953262F2AA0050">
of me, in a <HI>Note,</HI> p. 112, <HI>the Dr. for Rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf, did not chu&s;e to &s;ay, in plain Words, that</HI> NEGROES, <HI>knowing nothing of Religion, make a very large Part of his Million of the Mem|bers of the Church of England. But it is evident he has the&s;e in Re&s;erve to &s;ave the Truth of his Affir|mation.</HI> As I did not &s;ay <HI>in plain Words,</HI> neither did I give the lea&s;t Intimation, <HI>that Negroes, know|ing nothing of Religion,</HI> con&s;tituted any Part of the &s;uppo&s;ed Number of <HI>American</HI> Church-Men. If I had intended to include &s;uch, I &s;hould not have &s;poken of <HI>near a Million,</HI> but of <HI>many more than a Million,</HI> belonging to the Church. Al|though I had ob&s;erved, in p. 57, of the Slaves in general, that
<Q>they may be &s;aid in an <HI>imperfect</HI> Sen&s;e, to belong to the re&s;pective religious Cla&s;&s;es of their Owners;</Q>
yet I meant not to in|clude in the Account of <HI>near a Million,</HI> more of them than were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been actually ad|mitted, or were de&s;irous of being admitted, to be Members of the Church by Bapti&s;m: And &s;uch, it was hoped, might amount to the fourth Part of the whole Number.</P>
<P>THUS I have accounted for our having &s;aid, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>America</HI> contains near a Million of Members. After all, I am not po&s;itive but we may have &s;poken improperly; for which Rea&s;on, for my own Part, I &s;hall be contented hereafter to change the Mode of Expre&s;&s;ion, and in&s;tead of &s;aying, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>America</HI> contains <HI>near a Million</HI> of Members, to &s;ay it contains <HI>a third Part of all the Inhabitants of the Briti&s;h I&s;lands and Colonies in America,</HI> without including the Blacks; which Expre&s;&s;ion, I believe, can be fairly defended.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="011203_0188_0F953263AF044CF8">THE Doctor, in Order to confute the Account given in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> is plea&s;ed to &s;pend four or five Pages in Exhibitions of his own <HI>political Arithme|tic</HI>; but he appears not to be, any more than the Author of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> a BREREWOOD or a PETTY. I could ea&s;ily point out many Mi&s;takes in his Cal|culations; but I find it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pare the Rea|der's Patience wherever I can. The Effect of his Operations is, in his own Opinion of the Matter, that <HI>it is que&s;tionable, whether the Amount of epi&s;co|pal Profe&s;&s;ors, in all the&s;e Colonies will be more than</HI> about 270,000, p. 115. This Computation, I am per&s;uaded, would be found greatly defective upon a &s;trict Examination; but even allowing it to be ju&s;t, the Number is not contemptibly &s;mall. For 270,000 Members of the national Church in the <HI>American</HI> Colonies, are too many to be neglected. If any other Denomination of Prote&s;tants in this Country, con&s;i&s;ting of but a tenth Part of that Number, were to be refu&s;ed the Enjoyment of its own Form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government and Di&s;ci|pline, I doubt not but it would occa&s;ion a general Clamor throughout the Colonies, and perhaps throughout the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>THE deplorable State of the <HI>American</HI> Slaves was mentioned in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> and it was repre|&s;ented, that probably the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate would have a good Effect upon that wretched Cla&s;s of our Fellow-Creatures, for who&s;e &s;piritual Intere&s;ts we are under peculiar Obligations to be &s;ollicitous. The Doctor replies: <HI>Could he have hit upon nothing but an Epi&s;copate for their Relief? This, at be&s;t, is a far-fetched, round-about Expedient,</HI> p. 116. I could undoubtedly <HI>have hit</HI> upon &s;ome other Ex|pedients; but as the Ca&s;e of an Epi&s;copate was
<PB N="179" REF="011203_0189_0F9532647070E8D0">
under Con&s;ideration when the&s;e Blacks were intro|duced, it was then mo&s;t natural to <HI>hit</HI> upon that. And although he &s;eems to think the Expedient <HI>far-fetched</HI> and <HI>round-about,</HI> yet any one may &s;ee that I did not go far, nor much out of my Way, to meet with it. What he proceeds to &s;ay upon the Subject of Slavery, as it is not offered in Oppo&s;i|tion to any Thing advanced in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> how|ever it may de&s;erve the Con&s;ideration of the Pub|lic, is no particular Concern of mine, and therefore I &s;hall pa&s;s it over.</P>
<P>IT was repre&s;ented in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> p. 58, that
<Q>another Argument for granting an <HI>American</HI> E|pi&s;copate, ari&s;es from the Obligations of Grati|tude; a national Sen&s;e of which, ought, at this Time, to have a peculiar Efficacy in Favor of Religion in the <HI>American</HI> Plantations.</Q>
It is no <HI>round-about,</HI> but a direct Cour&s;e, that leads to this Inference. 'For the divine Goodne&s;s having been mo&s;t eminently di&s;played in <HI>America,</HI> where can it be &s;o proper to erect &s;ome &s;uitable Monument of religious Gratitude for this Goodne&s;s, as in <HI>Ameri|ca?</HI> What Method of doing this is &s;o natural, as farther to &s;ecure and extend that Religion, whereby the Honor of God is believed to be be&s;t promo|ted? This mu&s;t be the Religion, which in the O|pinion of the Nation, is the be&s;t and mo&s;t perfect; or, in other Words, the Religion of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> But what does he State of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>America</HI> require to be done, for its Welfare and Happine&s;s? Why, this Church is, in a Manner peri&s;hing for Want of common Nece&s;&s;aries. She has long been imploring Relief, under &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es as mu&s;t prove fatal to her, if much longer neglected. She therefore earne&s;tly re|que&s;ts,
<PB N="180" REF="011203_0190_0F9532652F9C85B8">
and She only reque&s;ts, that proper Reme|dies may be provided for her pre&s;ent Sufferings. This Reque&s;t is made with full Confidence of &s;uc|ceeding, as She wi&s;hes for nothing that &s;hall be thought incon&s;i&s;tent with the Rights and Safety of others. She a&s;ks for nothing but what has been granted to others, without any ill Con&s;equences; and She cannot but rely on the common Affection and Ju&s;|tice of the Nation to rai&s;e her to this Equality.' This is the Sub&s;tance of the Argument as it &s;tands in the <HI>Appeal.</HI></P>
<P>THE Doctor pretends that he cannot ea&s;ily di&s;|cern any <HI>&s;pecial Connection the victorious Succe&s;s of the Briti&s;h Arms in America has, with the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of an Epi&s;copate here.</HI> But this Connection has been clearly pointed out; and it is &s;ufficient for my Purpo&s;e, if it is vi&s;ible to others. <HI>Is the Reli|gion of the Church of England,</HI> &s;ays he, p. 119, <HI>the only true Religion on the American Continent?</HI> I &s;hall not now enter into a Di&s;qui&s;ition about the <HI>Number</HI> of true Religions, nor how far any Thing that contra|dicts the Truth may be true it&s;elf, but an&s;wer di|rectly to the Que&s;tion: The Religion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> is evidently the pure&s;t and be&s;t <HI>in the national Opinion,</HI> or it would never have been re|ceived as &s;uch, and e&s;tabli&s;hed at Home. But <HI>is Religion, in none of the other Forms, to be regarded?</HI> In my Judgment of the Matter, Religion under e|very Form ought to be regarded, in a greater or le&s;s Degree, as perhaps the wor&s;t Form of it is better than none at all; and under all Forms it ought to be tolerated, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the public Safety. But as no Man, nor Society of Men, can be under Obligations to promote or pro|pagate any Religion, which is believed by him or
<PB N="181" REF="011203_0191_0F953265F11AB590">
them to be fal&s;e; &s;o all Men are obliged to promote the Intere&s;ts of what they believe to be the true Religion, and more e&s;pecially after any &s;ignal In|terpo&s;itions of divine Providence in their Favor.</P>
<P><HI>WE do not e&s;teem it a Duty,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>much le&s;s an indi&s;pen&s;ible one, in Con&s;equence of the&s;e Conque&s;ts, to provide for the Security or Support of the Religion of Epi&s;copalians, any more than the Re|ligion of other Denominations of Chri&s;tians in the Colonies.</HI> But he, and tho&s;e of his Per&s;ua&s;ion, ought to e&s;teem it a Duty to provide for the Security of their own Religion, MORE than for that of the E|pi&s;copalians, or of any other Denominations of Chri&s;tians in the Colonies. The Ca&s;e is the &s;ame, with Regard to the Members of the Church of <HI>England</HI>; it is their Duty, in the fir&s;t Place, and more e&s;pecially, to provide for the Welfare and Se|curity of their own Religion. A proper Sen&s;e of this general Obligation in the Members of the Church, is all that we require; we claim no Rights for our&s;elves, but what we allow to all others. Both they and we ought undoubtedly to endeavor to &s;e|cure and promote our re&s;pective Religions; but we &s;hould all remember, what we are generally too apt to forget, that it is our Duty to attempt this, only in a fair and honorable Way, on either Side, and &s;o as not to interfere with the religious Privileges of tho&s;e who differ from us. This is putting the Mat|ter upon a fair and equitable Footing, and is do|ing to others, as we would have them do to us. And upon no wor&s;e a Footing than this, did the Argument of the <HI>Appeal</HI> proceed. It was not pre|tended that the late Di&s;play of the divine Goodne&s;s in <HI>America,</HI> was any Rea&s;on why the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould &s;upport and propagate the Religion of the

Church of <HI>England,</HI> in <HI>America</HI>; but it was, and &s;till is, in&s;i&s;ted, that it is a good Rea&s;on why the Members of the Church &s;hould: And as tho&s;e who have the Direction of our public Affairs, are chiefly Per&s;ons belonging to the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> it is a good Rea&s;on for <HI>them</HI> to engage im|mediately in Behalf of this Church in <HI>America,</HI> and even to provide for it an Epi&s;copate, &s;ince it is a Provi&s;ion &s;o manife&s;tly nece&s;&s;ary for its Welfare and Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>THE Doctor goes on for &s;ome Pages, endea|voring to de&s;troy the Force of the preceding Ar|gument; but what he has &s;aid with this View, ap|pears to me to be the weake&s;t of all the weak Things he has offered in his Performance. In p. 121, he conceits that I was <HI>under the Influence of an undue Warmth of Spirit,</HI> when I urged the Con&s;ideration which is now in Que&s;tion. I confe&s;s, I can hardly write upon, or con&s;ider, the "maimed State" in which the <HI>American</HI> Church of <HI>England</HI> is &s;till &s;uf|fered to continue, without &s;ome <HI>Warmth of Spirit</HI>; but that I have been influenced by <HI>an undue Warmth,</HI> I am not con&s;cious, nor do I believe. A Zeal for its Intere&s;ts, &s;o far as they interfere not with the ju&s;t Right of others, I profe&s;s; but no farther. But until it can be proved that my Zeal has led me to propo&s;e unwarrantable Mea&s;ures for the Re|lief of the Church, or that I have not &s;hewn a pro|per Regard for the Principles of religious Liberty; I &s;hall not be convinced that I have di&s;covered any <HI>undue Warmth of Spirit.</HI> But if there can be &s;uch a Thing in Nature, it mo&s;t glaringly and notori|ou&s;ly &s;hews it&s;elf in the Writers <HI>again&s;t</HI> the <HI>Appeal</HI>; and if it appears, in any Degree, in the Author of it, <HI>they</HI> certainly, of all Per&s;ons, have the lea&s;t

<Q>Fir&s;t ca&s;t out the Beam out of thine own Eye; and then &s;halt thou &s;ee clearly to ca&s;t out the Mote out of thy Brother's Eye.</Q></P>
<P>THE Doctor proceeds: <HI>I &s;carce know how to &s;peak upon the Matter &s;eriou&s;ly, it is placed in &s;o ludicrous a Light.</HI> He &s;hould rather have hone&s;tly confe&s;&s;ed, that he &s;carce knew how to <HI>rea&s;on</HI> upon the Matter <HI>ju&s;tly,</HI> or to make any plau&s;ible Oppo|&s;ition to the Argument, it was placed in &s;o <HI>convinc|ing</HI> a Light. Whether there was any Thing <HI>ludi|crous</HI> in my Repre&s;entation, is freely &s;ubmitted to the Reader's Judgment. In what Manner it ope|rated on the Doctor's <HI>Seriou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and how far he could have been in a <HI>gay</HI> or <HI>comic</HI> Humor when op|pre&s;&s;ed with the Weight of the Argument, may be ea&s;ily conjectured. That in this Situation he knew not how to <HI>rea&s;on</HI> upon the Matter <HI>ju&s;tly,</HI> appears from the very next Sentence.</P>
<P><HI>NOTWITHSTANDING the</HI>
<Q>di&s;ea&s;ed peri&s;h|ing</Q>
<HI>State of the American Church, have not Prai&s;es and Adorations, according to the</HI>
<Q>pure&s;t and be&s;t</Q>
<HI>Forms of Devotion, been offered up to Al|mighty God, in all the epi&s;copal A&s;&s;emblies on the Con|tinent, for the marvellous Interpo&s;itions of his Pro|vidence, in our Behalf, in the late War?</HI> The na|tural Import of which Sentence I take to be this: <HI>The epi&s;copal A&s;&s;emblies on the Continent have offered up Prai&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and therefore the American Church is not in a di&s;ea&s;ed peri&s;hing State, as is pretended.</HI> But whether this was really meant, I am not cer|tain. Perhaps the leading Sentiment was, that the public Thank&s;givings at the Conclu&s;ion of the War, were a &s;uitable Monument of Gratitude for
<PB N="184" REF="011203_0194_0F95326831805530">
the Succe&s;&s;es that attended it; and therefore that there is no Need of an Epi&s;copate, con&s;idered as a Monument of Gratitude. If this was the Mean|ing, it was improperly expre&s;&s;ed; and the Me|thod of rea&s;oning is as obnoxious as the Manner of expre&s;&s;ing it. A Monument is always under|&s;tood to be Something that is permanent, and vi&s;i|ble to the World; it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a WORK, and not an ENERGY, or tran&s;ient Act. The ge|neral public Thank&s;giving was a &s;uitable <HI>Tribute</HI> of Gratitude, but it could be no <HI>Monument.</HI> But even if it was, it might have been our Duty to rai&s;e other Monuments of Gratitude, and that of an Epi&s;copate among the re&s;t. The Doctor mentions <HI>grateful Hearts and well-ordered Conver&s;ations</HI> as be|ing <HI>&s;uitable Monuments</HI> on that Occa&s;ion. I intirely agree with him in this; and I believe the Obliga|tion to erect them, was not in the lea&s;t &s;uper&s;eded by the Monument, if we are &s;o to call it, of a public Thank&s;giving. The Truth is, as I conceive, all po&s;&s;ible Honor ought to be paid to the &s;upreme Ruler of Events, and EVERY proper Monument of religious Gratitude ought to be rai&s;ed, whenever his Providence calls us to proclaim, and perpetuate, to the World, our Sen&s;e of his great and di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Goodne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE next Section of the <HI>Appeal</HI> treats of the Obligations we are under as Chri&s;tians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. VII.</NOTE> to propagate the Go&s;pel among&s;t the <HI>American</HI> Hea|thens, and of the Advantages that might be ex|pected from an Epi&s;copate, in the Conduct and Execution of that good Work, whenever it &s;hall be undertaken upon that exten&s;ive Plan, which many worthy Members of the Society propo&s;e. As to what was &s;aid concerning our Obligations to this Duty, I am &s;o happy as to find Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> mo&s;tly agreeing with me in Sentiments; but with Regard to the proper Methods of performing it, and the U&s;efulne&s;s of an Epi&s;copate to that End, we differ, as is u&s;ual.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Thing he controverts in this Section, is the Propriety of <HI>civilizing</HI> Savages in Order to their Conver&s;ion. I had a&s;&s;igned &s;ome Rea&s;ons, and produced &s;ome Authorities, to &s;upport what appears to have become the general Opinion; namely, that Humanity, or Civility of Manners, is, in &s;ome Degree, previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary, that Chri&s;tianity may have its proper Effect upon the <HI>American</HI> Heathens. Again&s;t what was offered to this Purpo&s;e, the Doctor oppo&s;es the Experience of <HI>New-England,</HI> telling us, p. 125, that <HI>many Tribes of them</HI> (the Indians) <HI>in the</HI> Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett'<HI>s Province, have, by this Means,</HI> viz. <HI>The Engli&s;h Way of Living, been &s;o depopulated, that there are now
<PB N="186" REF="011203_0196_0F95326AF731D648">
&s;carce any Remains of them to be &s;een.</HI> From whence he &s;eems to be po&s;itive in this Conclu&s;ion, that there is not <HI>any Need of what is called civilizing them, in Order to their embracing Chri&s;tianity. Their being Savages,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and living in a Way different from what we do, is no Rea&s;on why their Conver&s;ion may not be expected, if &s;uitable Means were u&s;ed with them,</HI> p. 126.</P>
<P>AS to the Depopulation of &s;ome Tribes of In|dians within the Bounds, or on the Borders of <HI>New-England,</HI> it may have been greatly owing to &s;ome Vices, which their Intercour&s;e with the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> furni&s;hed them with an Opportunity to indulge. But there is no natural Connection, I hope, between Civility of Manners, and the Practice of &s;uch de|&s;tructive Vices. I cannot learn that the Indians thus de&s;troyed were greatly civilized. Barely com|ing once in a while among&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Inhabitants, di&s;po&s;ing of their Peltry, and purcha&s;ing &s;uch Ar|ticles as they commonly received in Exchange, could not much improve the Manners of Savages. They mu&s;t know &s;omething of Letters, re&s;ide in fixed Habitations, practice Hu&s;bandry and the nece&s;&s;ary mechanic Arts, before they can be &s;aid to have come out of their &s;avage State. Now it is incon|ceiveable that either of the&s;e Particulars, or all of them, can have a Tendency to de&s;troy any Part of the human Species. If any of the <HI>Tribes in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Province,</HI> which were &s;o far civilized, <HI>have been depopulated</HI>; it cannot have been owing to their <HI>Engli&s;h Way of living,</HI> but to other Cau&s;es, perhaps to &s;uch as were accidental or local. I have met with &s;everal <HI>New-England</HI> Writers who differ widely from the Doctor; a&s;cribing the Depopula|tion of &s;o many Indian Tribes, not to the Cau&s;e
<PB N="187" REF="011203_0197_0F95326B2EE31CE0">
a&s;&s;igned by him, but to the immediate Hand of God, who thought fit to cut off tho&s;e idolatrous Nations, to make Room for the Settlement of his cho&s;en People. Be this as it may, the Nature and Di&s;po&s;ition of Savages, of all Ages, of all Countries and Complexions, are &s;o nearly the &s;ame; that all the Trials which have been made with any of them, as well as what has happened in <HI>New-England,</HI> will afford Light to the pre&s;ent general Subject.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY, as was ob&s;erved from Dr. <HI>Bray,</HI> flouri&s;hed or declined in the early Ages of the Church, in almo&s;t an exact Proportion to Men's Improvement in Letters and civilized Manners. In modern Ages, the mo&s;t judicious and experi|enced Mi&s;&s;ionaries, have judged that the Go&s;pel can have but little Effect with Barbarians and Sava|ges. It was a Maxim with Father <HI>Labat,</HI> who had been a celebrated Mi&s;&s;ionary in the American I|&s;lands,
<Q>that in Order to make the Americans CHRISTIANS, it was previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to make them MEN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mo&s;heim</HI>'s Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, Vol II. p. 307.</NOTE>.</Q>
<HI>Hans Egede,</HI> a <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionary, who had re&s;ided 25 Years in <HI>Greenland,</HI> was of the &s;ame Opinion.
<Q>It is a Matter that cannot be que&s;tioned, &s;ays he, that if you will make a Man a Chri&s;tian out of a mere Savage and wild Man, you mu&s;t fir&s;t make him a rea&s;onable Man.&mdash;It would contribute a great Deal to forward their Conver&s;ion, if they could, by Degrees, be brought into a &s;ettled Way of Life<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>the Divine Legation,</HI> &amp;c. Vol. II. p. 71.</NOTE>.</Q>
Father <HI>Hennepin,</HI> for many Years a Mi&s;&s;ionary in <HI>Canada</HI> and the interior Parts of America, among the Ob|&s;tacles in the Way of converting the American In|dians,
<PB N="188" REF="011203_0198_0F95326BEE172DD8">
mentions their &s;avage Manner of Life.
<Q>They are not fixed in a Place, tarrying no longer in their Villages, than till Harve&s;t is over, which is but a &s;mall Time; all the re&s;t of the Year they pa&s;s in Wars and hunting: Then they carry all their Families with them, and are ab&s;ent eight or nine Months; their Children then for|get all, and return to their former Manner of Living<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Miller</HI>'s Propagation of Chri&s;tianity, Vol. II. p. 262.</NOTE>.</Q>
The&s;e are the Sentiments of &s;ome of the mo&s;t famous Mi&s;&s;ionaries of the&s;e latter Ages, in different Parts of the World. The mo&s;t celebrated Writers, both at home and abroad, have joined in the &s;ame Opinion. The very learned <HI>Mo&s;heim</HI> &s;ays:
<Q>As to tho&s;e Indians, who live more remote from the <HI>European</HI> Settlements, and wander about in the Woods without any fixed Habitation, they are ab&s;olutely incapable either of receiving or retaining any adequate Notions of the Chri&s;tian Doctrine, unle&s;s they be previ|ou&s;ly reclaimed from that vagarant Manner of Life, and civilized by an Intercour&s;e with Per&s;ons, who&s;e humane and in&s;inuating Manners are adapted to attract their Love and excite their Imitation<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, Vol. II. p. 306.</NOTE>.</Q>
The more learned Author of the DIVINE LEGATION <HI>of Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;ays:
<Q>Chri&s;tianity, plain and &s;imple as it is, and fitted in its Na|ture for what it was de&s;igned by its Author, re|quires an Intellect above that of a mere Savage to under&s;tand. Something then mu&s;t be previ|ous to it. And what is that Something but CIVIL SOCIETY<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Divine Legation of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> Vol. II. p. 70.</NOTE>.</Q>
Again, he complains that &s;ome Men, "having taken it into their Heads" (like Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>)
<Q>that the Vices of improved
<PB N="189" REF="011203_0199_0F95326CAD9A29F0">
Life would more <HI>indi&s;po&s;e</HI> the Indians to the <HI>Precepts</HI> of the Go&s;pel, than their pre&s;ent Bru|tality <HI>incapacitates</HI> them from comprehending the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of it, have concluded it be&s;t, upon the whole, to keep their Eyes &s;hut to the Ad|vantages of civil Life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Divine Legation of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> Vol. II. p. 70.</NOTE>.</Q>
I might ea&s;ily produce the Authority of many other great Names, to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; but the above, I apprehend, are &s;uf|ficient to counter-ballance the Weight of Dr. <HI>Chaun|cy</HI>'s, who barely gives his Opinion, without offer|ing his Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE next Thing he controverts, is my Account of the Society's Plan for a more general and vigo|rous Attempt to convert the <HI>American</HI> Heathens. Not that the Fact is denied, or the Propriety of the Re&s;olution di&s;puted; but it is pretended, that this Account contradicts what had been before a&s;|&s;erted, namely,
<Q>that the Support and Propagation of the Go&s;pel among our own People in <HI>America,</HI> was the immediate and princpial De&s;ign of their Incorporation.</Q>
Whether the Conver&s;ion of the Heathens was, or was not, the Object primarily and more immediately in View, when the Society was incorporated, may be ea&s;ily &s;een. The Charter of Incorporation, and an authentic Hi&s;tory of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of that charitable In&s;titution for near thirty Years, are extant, and Copies of them are in many Hands. It would be very extraordinary indeed, if the Charter &s;hould have mi&s;taken its own immediate and primary Object; and equally extraordinary, if the original Members, who ap|plied for it, &s;hould not have known their own In|tentions. The Charter mentions the great End in View to be no other, than
<Q>to promote the Glory
<PB N="190" REF="011203_0200_0F95326D6FAC5C68">
of God, by the In&s;truction of OUR PEOPLE in the Chri&s;tian Religion.</Q>
In the Preamble it &s;peaks no le&s;s than <HI>thrice</HI> of the King's LOVING SUBJECTS, as the great and immediate Object of the intended Charity; and &s;ays not a Word of the <HI>American</HI> Heathens. And it appears from the Hi&s;|tory of the Society, from their yearly Ab&s;tracts, and anniver&s;ary Sermons, that the Members of that venerable Body, never under&s;tood, or imagined, that the Conver&s;ion of Heathens was to be their principal and more immediate Work. The Ca&s;e is &s;o uncommonly plain, that even Dr. <HI>May|hew,</HI> was compelled by the Force of Evidence, contrary to his own Inclination and the Scope of his Argument, to confe&s;s, that
<Q>it appears that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plantations, &amp;c. were really the <HI>prima|ry,</HI> more <HI>immediate</HI> Object of this In&s;titution, or the King's SUBJECTS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations, &amp;c. p. 18.</NOTE>.</Q>
But at the &s;ame Time it is farther evident, although not from the Charter as Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI> pretended, that the Con|ver&s;ion of the <HI>American</HI> Heathens was notwith|&s;tanding an Object more remotely in View, with many of the original and principal Members, and very probably with the Royal Founder him&s;elf. And, from the Beginning to this Day, the Society have always under&s;tood that they have a di&s;creti|onary Power of employing &s;uch a Part of the Do|nations intru&s;ted with them, as their more immedi|ate Duty to the King's <HI>American Subjects</HI> would admit of, for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel among&s;t the Indians bordering upon our Settlements. Accord|ingly
<Q>they have always employed &s;ome Per&s;ons in this Service; and I believe it may be truly &s;aid, that they have never neglected any fair Opening to introduce the Go&s;pel among&s;t the <HI>American</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="011203_0201_0F95326E3136C528">
Heathens, e&s;pecially if proper Per&s;ons could be found, to engage in &s;uch a Mi&s;&s;ion.</Q>
Where now is the Incon&s;i&s;tency in all this? May not the Conver&s;ion of the Indians be properly an Object con&s;tantly aimed at by this worthy Society, although not its primary and immediate Object? Is not <HI>pri|mary</HI> a relative Term, &s;uppo&s;ing Something that is <HI>&s;econdary,</HI> or to follow it? Has it ever been &s;aid on the Side of the Church, that the Society, &s;o far as they have engaged in propagating the Go&s;|pel among&s;t the Savages, have acted improperly? Or, that they undertook what was not <HI>their proper Work?</HI> And, <HI>now an Epi&s;copate is in View,</HI> is it &s;aid or in&s;inuated, that it is their <HI>primary</HI> and im|mediate Object? Where then is the Contradiction that is pretended? And how utterly groundle&s;s is the following Reflection? <HI>The Writers on the epi&s;|copalian Side, have the Advantage beyond all others. They can make U&s;e of the &s;ame Argument, with a good Grace, to contrary Purpo&s;es,</HI> p. 127.</P>
<P>AS to the Advantage here mentioned, if it had been really claimed or made U&s;e of by <HI>the Wri|ters on the epi&s;copalian Side,</HI> it cannot ju&s;tly be &s;aid that they claim, or <HI>make U&s;e of it,</HI> BEYOND <HI>all others.</HI> I can point out an Example that is <HI>equal</HI> to it, which has been Matter of common Ob&s;er|vation. The Doctor well knows that <HI>the Writers on the anti-epi&s;copalian Side,</HI> for &s;everal Years before the Publication of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> had a&s;&s;erted and &s;tre|nuou&s;ly contended, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> has no general E&s;tabli&s;hment in the <HI>American</HI> Co|lonies. But, <HI>now an Epi&s;copate is in View,</HI> they can tell us a different Story,&mdash;arguing, that the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate mu&s;t operate here in the &s;ame Manner that epi&s;copal Government operates in
<PB N="192" REF="011203_0202_0F95326EEEFEB360">
<HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e of its general E&s;tabli&s;hment. They do not indeed commonly go &s;o far as to &s;ay, direct|ly and in plain Words, that the Church is thus e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the Colonies; but their Way of rea&s;on|ing manife&s;tly implies it. So that, we &s;ee, the Writers again&s;t the Church <HI>have</HI> al&s;o <HI>the Advantage</HI> of making <HI>U&s;e of the &s;ame Argument, to contrary Pur|po&s;es,</HI> or rather, of oppo&s;ite Principles to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; but I cannot &s;ay that they do this <HI>with a good Grace.</HI></P>
<P>INSTEAD of the Advantages expected from car|rying on the Attempts to pro&s;elyte the <HI>American</HI> Heathens, under the Direction of a re&s;ident Bi&s;hop, the Doctor &s;ays, <HI>this &s;uperintending Bu&s;ine&s;s might, to better Purpo&s;e, be put into other Hands,</HI> p. 128. He then introduces <HI>the Society in Scotland, for the Propagation of Chri&s;tian Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>the honor|able Company for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel in New-England,</HI> who <HI>manage their Affairs</HI> by <HI>Commi&s;|&s;ioners,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>the Laity as well as Clergy,</HI> as In&s;tances to prove, that the Superintendency of a Bi&s;hop would be no Advantage to <HI>our</HI> Society, with Regard to the Conver&s;ion of the Indians. It might as well be proved, from the Example of <HI>the Churches in the Colonies,</HI> that a Bi&s;hop is not nece&s;&s;ary for the Purpo&s;e of <HI>Ordination,</HI> &s;ince, with them, that End is al&s;o obtained without a Bi|&s;hop. But it &s;hould have been remembered, that although a Bi&s;hop in neither Ca&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary on <HI>their</HI> Principles, yet in both Ca&s;es he may be nece&s;|&s;ary on <HI>ours.</HI></P>
<P>THE Example of tho&s;e two Societies can be expected to have but little Effect upon the World, until their Conduct &s;hall be better known to the
<PB N="193" REF="011203_0203_0F95326FAF06A688">
Public. An Account of their Con&s;titution, of the Condition and Management of their Funds, of the Per&s;ons employed in their Service, and the Places and State of their particular Mi&s;&s;ions, is a <HI>De&s;ideratum</HI> which has been long looked for; and until it is obtained, many Per&s;ons will entertain unfavorable Su&s;picions.

<P>AS to <HI>the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;|pel,</HI> the Doctor fears <HI>whether, in what is propo&s;ed to be done by them, a Regard to the Church, as e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in England, may not be too much mingled with the common Cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity.</HI> A <HI>friendly</HI> Cau|tion of this Nature would undoubtedly be well ac|cepted, as all Chri&s;tians are more or le&s;s liable to <HI>mingle</HI> the Intere&s;ts of Party <HI>with the common Cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity.</HI> But this Society is as irreproachable in this Re&s;pect, as any Society that can be mention|ed, without Exception. Its Members hitherto appear to have acted as di&s;intere&s;tedly, and to have mingled Con&s;iderations of a private Nature with their pub|lic Proceedings as little, as can be expected from the be&s;t of <HI>Men.</HI> They are di&s;po&s;ed to be upon friend|ly Terms with all Denominations of Chri&s;tians in the Colonies; and if there is any Danger of their acting contrary to &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition, it mu&s;t ari&s;e, not from them&s;elves, but from tho&s;e who make it in &s;ome Degree nece&s;&s;ary, by an unrea&s;onable Op|po&s;ition to all their Mea&s;ures. It is natural for Men to defend them&s;elves; and &s;o far as Self-De|fence &s;hall oblige them to regard the <HI>peculiar In|tere&s;ts</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> they may be ex|pected
<PB N="195" REF="011203_0205_0F95327132A64B18">
to be cautious. But I dare ri&s;que all my Intere&s;t and Reputation upon it, that they will never be backward to cultivate, on their Part, a friendly Corre&s;pondence with every Denomination of Prote&s;tants, whether here or el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P><Q>As <HI>America</HI> is the Region wherein the divine Goodne&s;s has been more remarkably di&s;played in Favor of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation,</Q>
the Doctor con|cludes that <HI>Americans are the proper Per&s;ons to erect</HI> '&s;ome &s;uitable Monument of religious Gratitude,' <HI>on that Account,</HI> p. 130. But if that Goodne&s;s was not di&s;played in Favor of <HI>Americans, Americans</HI> are under no Obligations of Gratitude on Account of it. If it was
<Q>di&s;played in Favor of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation,</Q>
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation is under Obligations to erect
<Q>&s;ome &s;uitable Monument of religious Gratitude.</Q>
The Truth of the Ca&s;e is, as the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation in general, and the <HI>Americans</HI> in particular, were remarkably favored by divine Pro|vidence in the late War, the Duty is incumbent upon both; and &s;aying that the <HI>Americans</HI> are o|bliged, is not proving that the Nation is not obliged, to perform it. The Doctor &s;eems to allow of my Po&s;ition, that
<Q><HI>America</HI> is the very Ground, on which &s;ome &s;uitable Monument of religious Gra|titude ought to be erected;</Q>
and he differs not greatly from me, when he &s;ays, <HI>what more &s;uitable one, than a vi&s;ible perpetually &s;tanding Te&s;timony of their pious Concern, and earne&s;t Care, to &s;pread the Knowledge of their only Lord who has done &s;uch great Things for them?</HI> The chief Difference between us is, that he &s;eems, in this Pa&s;&s;age, to make that to be the whole of the <HI>Te&s;timony of their pious Concern</HI> and 'religious Gratitude,' which I would have to be but a Part of it.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="011203_0206_0F953271ED137D60">HE goes on to complain, that the Endeavors of <HI>the non-epi&s;copal Clergy and Laity in the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts-Province,</HI> to do &s;omething in this Way, <HI>upon the Conclu&s;ion of the late War,</HI> were defeated at Home.

<Q>The Doctor may be a&s;&s;ured that his Hope is well founded, and <HI>the Accounts he had,</HI> not true.

of this Affair, he &s;ays&mdash;<HI>The Plan as pre&s;ented, was liable to &s;everal Objections; particularly that the Members were to be accountable only to them|&s;elves. However the Society made</HI> NO OPPOSI|TION TO IT<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vindicat.</HI> p. 74.</NOTE>.</Q>
The Letter here quoted I have &s;een, and from an Acquaintance with the Hand-Writing, know it to be <HI>genuine.</HI> The Author of it was no le&s;s a Per&s;on, a no le&s;s <HI>important Member of the Society,</HI> than their PRESIDENT at that Time; who&s;e eminent Integrity, Abilities, and Attention to the Affairs of the Society, leave no Po&s;&s;ibility of &s;u&s;pecting that he could either mi&s;repre&s;ent, or mi&s;take, the Matter. And from his &s;hort Account, the&s;e Things appear, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Plan was not &s;o properly rejected, as the Draught that was pre|&s;ented&mdash;that the Draught was rejected, not be|cau&s;e the De&s;ign of it was di&s;liked, but becau&s;e it was improperly framed&mdash;and, that the Rejection, whether ju&s;tifiable or not, was not owing, in any Degree, to the Society. Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> another Member of the Society, after inquiring upon the Spot, goes farther, and &s;ays:
<Q>I can affirm, on very good Authority, that neither the Society nor any Epi&s;copalians, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> oppo&s;ed the Act of the <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> A&s;&s;embly for the Purpo&s;e here mentioned.

<P>THE next Section of the <HI>Appeal</HI> contains
<Q>the Plan on which alone <HI>American</HI> Bi&s;hops have been reque&s;ted, <HI>fairly</HI> &s;tated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. VIII.</NOTE> with Expo&s;tu|lations on the Rea&s;onablene&s;s thereof.</Q>
Dr. <HI>Chaun|cy,</HI> in his <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to it, begins with taking Notice of what he calls, <HI>a Copy of the Petition that was &s;ent, by a Number of the epi&s;copal Clergy, to the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge,</HI> which had lately appeared in one of the <HI>public Papers</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; in which Copy there are &s;everal Expre&s;&s;ions which he looks on as highly exceptionable. This Copy I have &s;een; its Editor and Annotator pretended that it was the Tran&s;cript of an Addre&s;s drawn up and &s;ent, by a Convention of the epi&s;copal Clergy of <HI>New-York,</HI> and <HI>New-Jer&s;ey.</HI> But the Doctor mu&s;t have &s;ince heard that the Convention di&s;claims it; and I can and do a&s;&s;ure him that it is fictitious and fal&s;e, and that the Convention &s;ent home no &s;uch Addre&s;s, nor any that contained &s;imilar Expre&s;&s;ions with tho&s;e which he cen&s;ures.</P>
<P>HE informs us, in p. 135, that <HI>&s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable Epi&s;copalians</HI> in New-England&mdash;<HI>have de|clared it to be their Opinion, that Bi&s;hops would be of no Service here, and that they did not de&s;ire they &s;hould be &s;ent.</HI> Whether he has any Thing pecu|liar in his Idea of <HI>re&s;pectable Epi&s;copalians,</HI> and of <HI>a &s;teady Attachment to the Intere&s;t of the Church of England,</HI> which he makes to be part of their Cha|racter;
<PB N="200" REF="011203_0210_0F9532768EA04728">
and what we are to under&s;tand by the in|definite Word <HI>&s;ome,</HI> whether Two or Two Hun|dred, is impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ay. He may have met with, or heard of, <HI>&s;ome, i. e.</HI> Two or more <HI>re&s;pectable Epi&s;copalians,</HI> who were not de&s;irous of having Bi&s;hops in <HI>America,</HI> meaning Bi&s;hops with &s;uch temporal Powers as they exerci&s;e in <HI>England:</HI> But I much que&s;tion whether there is an Epi&s;copa|lian upon the Continent, either of a more or le&s;s re&s;pectable Character, including in it &s;ome Degree of <HI>Attachment to the Intere&s;t of the Church,</HI> that has objected again&s;t an Epi&s;copate upon the Plan of the <HI>Appeal.</HI> If there be any &s;uch, I will ven|ture to affirm, that they have acted a very unna|tural, incon&s;i&s;tent Part. For how ab&s;urd is it for a Man, who is attached to the Intere&s;t of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> not to wi&s;h it Soundne&s;s and Health? But how can it be &s;ound and healthy, while its Con&s;titution is broken, and deprived of that which is e&s;&s;ential to its Well-be|ing? Where can be the Harm of having epi&s;copal Ordination admini&s;tred in the Colonies?
<Q>What is the Fear,</Q>
from having the Clergy brought under a &s;tricter Di&s;cipline? "What the Danger," in giving an Opportunity to &s;uch as are de&s;irous of Confirmation, to receive it in this Country? The&s;e are the ONLY Ends propo&s;ed by an Epi&s;copate; and every Epi&s;copalian mu&s;t allow that the&s;e are real Advantages. And &s;ince the Power of <HI>American</HI> Bi&s;hops is to be confined to the Clergy of our own Church, and will bring no Burthen or Expence upon any Part of the Country, or upon Individu|als; it is inconceivable that any Epi&s;copalians &s;hould not de&s;ire it, excepting &s;uch clerical Delin|quents as fear, by Means of &s;uch an Epi&s;copate, to be brought to Puni&s;hment. For my Part, I have
<PB N="201" REF="011203_0211_0F9532772DE9B150">
met with no &s;uch Epi&s;copalians, nor have <HI>particu|larly</HI> heard of any &s;uch: But on the other Hand, I have been told by <HI>many</HI> of the Di&s;&s;enters, and by <HI>&s;everal</HI> of their Clergy, and even by <HI>&s;ome</HI> of their Clergy belonging to <HI>New-England,</HI> that they thought it unrea&s;onable that any &s;hould object to our Propo|&s;al.</P>
<P>I MEET with nothing farther worthy of Notice, after what has been already animadverted on, until we come to p. 138. The Doctor there objects to our Plan, becau&s;e he thinks it has been illegally &s;ettled. He takes it for granted, that what has been done by our Friends and Superiors at Home relating to it, has been done without the King's Approbation. And he argues that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>the Con&s;titution of the Church,</HI> and the e&s;tabli&s;hed Doctrine of the <HI>King's Supremacy,</HI> to take &s;uch a Step; and that <HI>even the</HI> CONVOCATION, <HI>when convened by the King's Writ, hath no Authority to &s;ettle any Plan without his Con|&s;ent, nor indeed &s;o much as to</HI> ATTEMPT <HI>to form one without</HI> HIS LICENCE. What the Rights and Powers of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Convocation are, is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire; as it is not pretended that the Plan in Que&s;tion was &s;ettled in Convocation. Al|lowing that the two Hou&s;es of Convocation, ac|cording to the Declaration of the upper Hou&s;e in 1702, as quoted by the Doctor,
<Q>without a royal Licence, have no Authority to attempt, enact, promulge, or execute any CANON by whatever Name it might be called,</Q>
which is the Lan|guage of the Statute of the 25 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII; yet not|with&s;tanding, the Clergy, even in Convocation,
<Q>are &s;till in &s;everal inferior In&s;tances, left prefectly free<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Atterbury's Rights,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>of an Engli&s;h Convocation,</HI> p. 132. See al&s;o <HI>Wake's State of the Church,</HI> p. 85,</NOTE>.</Q>
The two Hou&s;es of <HI>Parliament,</HI> cannot, without a
<PB N="202" REF="011203_0212_0F953277EFC85C60">
royal Licence, attempt, enact, promulge or exe|cute any <HI>Statute,</HI> more legally than the two Hou&s;es of <HI>Convocation</HI> can enact a <HI>Canon</HI>; but I hope the Members both of Parliament and <HI>Convocation,</HI> whether legally convened, or not convened, as they happen to meet with one another, may confer upon and propo&s;e Plans for the public Good, and agree to carry them into Execution, as &s;oon as the royal Licence &s;hall permit them to act in their legi&s;la|tive Capacity. Every A&s;&s;ociation of <HI>di&s;affected</HI> Per&s;ons ought to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; but Con&s;ultations for the public Happine&s;s, held by Per&s;ons of the utmo&s;t Fidelity, with a due Deference and Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to the Wi&s;dom of Government, will always be encouraged by prudent Princes, and under wi&s;e Admini&s;trations. If nothing farther than this, could be &s;aid in Favor of tho&s;e who &s;ettled the Plan for an <HI>American</HI> Epi&s;copate, it would be &s;uf|ficient to ju&s;tify them: And the Doctor would have no Rea&s;on to cry out, as he does, p. 139, in the following &s;upercilious Language: <HI>Is this Man|ner of Conduct, in any Degree, conformable to the con&s;tituted Order of the Church of England? Dare Bi&s;hops, or even Archbi&s;hops, at home, venture upon a Method of acting &s;o repugnant to the</HI> SUPREMACY <HI>in all eccle&s;ia&s;tical Matters, with which, by repeated Acts of Parliament, the</HI> CROWN <HI>has been ve&s;ted?</HI> That he is much mi&s;taken in his Notion of the King's Supremacy, as maintained by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> has been already proved; that he is al&s;o mi&s;taken in his Notion of the general <HI>con&s;tituted Order</HI> of that Church, is too plain to require any Proof.</P>
<P>HE has pronounced all Con&s;ultations of our Bi&s;hops for the Intere&s;t of Religion, to be, in ge|neral,
<PB N="203" REF="011203_0213_0F953278AF0FC678">
an Infringement of the King's Supremacy, unle&s;s a Licence for that Purpo&s;e is formally grant|ed by the Crown. But can any Man believe this to be true, in the Sen&s;e wherein it is affirmed; and without any Exceptions? Suppo&s;ing the King were made acquainted with the particular Subject of any &s;uch Deliberation, and privately con&s;ulted upon it, and he &s;hould give undoubted Proofs of his Approbation of the Mea&s;ure; would the Doctor &s;till call it an Infringement of the Supremacy? If not, neither &s;hould he thus &s;peak of the Plan in Que&s;tion, as it has been honored in this Manner, with the royal Approbation. And here it may be proper to explain what has been before &s;aid; name|ly, that the Plan was &s;ettled by tho&s;e, who were warranted by a royal Commi&s;&s;ion con&s;titutionally i&s;&s;ued. The <HI>Charter</HI> granted to <HI>the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel,</HI> has the Nature and Ef|ficacy of a royal Commi&s;&s;ion. By this Charter or Commi&s;&s;ion, the Members are warranted to concert Mea&s;ures and to <HI>&s;ettle Plans,</HI> for carrying on the De&s;ign of their Incorporation in the mo&s;t effectual Manner. The Society &s;oon &s;aw, that an <HI>American</HI> Epi&s;copate was highly expedient to this Purpo&s;e; they therefore &s;ketched out a general Plan for &s;end|ing Bi&s;hops to <HI>America,</HI> which Plan was publickly approved and patronized by her Maje&s;ty, Queen ANNE. Many Cau&s;es concured to delay the Exe|cution of it, at that Time, and through the Two &s;ucceeding Reigns; but Marks of the royal Appro|bation were not wanting in either of them. Of late Years the Plan has been re&s;umed and dige&s;ted with peculiar Attention, and our pre&s;ent mo&s;t gracious Sovereign has given it particular Encourage|ment. <HI>Surely,</HI> after this Explanation the Doctor will not &s;ay, <HI>a Plan for an Epi&s;copate thus formed,
<PB N="204" REF="011203_0214_0F9532796F67F0C8">
&s;ettled and publi&s;hed, ought to have no great Regard paid to it.</HI> For were it incon&s;iderable in it&s;elf, it is &s;till re&s;pectable on Account of its honorable Origin.</P>
<P>IN p. 140, he goes on, fulminating again&s;t the Audaciou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who ventured to form and encourage the Plan; and <HI>(Ri&s;um tenea|tis?)</HI> con&s;trues it to be a <HI>direct Violation</HI> of the 73d CANON. The Canon injoins,
<Q>that no Prie&s;ts, or Mini&s;ters of God's Word, nor any other Per&s;ons &s;hall meet together in any private Hou&s;e, or el&s;ewhere, to con&s;ult upon any Matter or Cour&s;e to be taken by them, or upon their Mo|tion, or Direction by any others, which may any Way tend to the <HI>impeaching,</HI> or <HI>depraving</HI> of the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or of the Book of Common-Prayer, or of any Part of the Government or Di&s;cipline now e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> under Pain of Excommu|nication <HI>ip&s;o Facto.</HI></Q>
Whoever knows any Thing of the Hi&s;tory of the Times in which the Canon was framed, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that it was <HI>de&s;igned</HI> again&s;t a very different Sort of Per&s;ons from tho&s;e venerable Prelates, who formed and &s;ettled the Plan for an American Epi&s;copate. And as it was de&s;igned again&s;t a different Sort of Per&s;ons, &s;o the Words of it <HI>clearly point out</HI> a very different Con|duct. I know not but the Doctor may laugh at me, for <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> replying to what is evidently in it|&s;elf &s;o <HI>highly extravagant, I might rather &s;ay, to a great Degree ludicrous</HI>; but yet I am really unable to determine, whether he was, or was not, &s;erious him&s;elf, at the Time of his writing. However, on the favorable Suppo&s;ition that he was &s;erious, as I pre&s;ume he <HI>ought</HI> to have been, I will proceed to ob|&s;erve,
<PB N="205" REF="011203_0215_0F95327A2CF4ED28">
&mdash;That what the Canon condemns, are fac|tious Combinations and Con&s;ultations which tend to <HI>impeach</HI> and <HI>deprave</HI> the Doctrine, Liturgy or Government of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> If there|fore the forming of the Plan for an <HI>American</HI> Epi&s;|copate has no &s;uch Tendency, it comes not within the <HI>Words,</HI> any more than within the <HI>Intent</HI> of the Canon.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;ays the Doctor, it is <HI>a Plan for altering the Government and Di&s;cipline of the Church of Eng|land in the Colonies.</HI> Does he then believe the Ca|non was intended to &s;ecure the Government and Di&s;cipline of the Church of England <HI>in the Co|lonies?</HI> Without this Intention, the Propo&s;al of any Alteration of the Form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Go|vernment here, can be no Violation of the Canon. But what is the Nature and Tendency of the Alte|ration propo&s;ed? Is it to <HI>deprave</HI> the Government of the Church of England <HI>at Home?</HI> No, it is in Reality to honor it, by endeavoring to bring the Government of the Church here much nearer to her Pattern and Example, than it is, or can be, while de&s;titute of Bi&s;hops. Nor is the Plan for a different <HI>Mode</HI> of an Epi&s;copate for the Church of America, any <HI>Impeachment</HI> of that under which it exi&s;ts in England. As to &s;uch Externals, the Church of England has always allowed them to be Things that are alterable, and that they ought to be altered, according to the Circum&s;tances and Opinions of different Countries, or even of the &s;ame Country in different Ages. To &s;ay therefore that Circum&s;tances in America require, or make it ex|pedient, that the <HI>Externals</HI> of an Epi&s;copate &s;hould be under a Regulation peculiar to this Country, is &s;aying no more than the Church of England has
<PB N="206" REF="011203_0216_0F95327C41380EB8">
always, in Effect, &s;aid and implies no Reflection upon the E&s;tabli&s;hment at home, which al&s;o may be be&s;t fitted for a Church &s;ituated as the national Church is in England.</P>
<P>IN p. 141, the Doctor, although he is of Opi|nion that he <HI>might be rea&s;onably excu&s;ed from taking any farther Notice of this Plan, as it is, not only de&s;titute of all Authority, but comes</HI> HANDED TO CONSIDERATION, <HI>in evident Contradiction to it</HI>; yet, upon the whole, thinks proper to <HI>go on, and di&s;|tinctly mention the Objections</HI> WE <HI>have,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>to make again&s;t it.</HI> Here then the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Bu|&s;ine&s;s of his Publication comes forward; in which, he not only lays out his own Strength, but calls in to his Aid what was POWERFULLY <HI>offered by the late excellent Dr. Mayhew.</HI> His own Objections he di&s;tingui&s;hes, ranges and numbers, as follows.</P>
<P>OBJECT. 1. <HI>THE Government and Di&s;cipline of the Church of England under the propo&s;ed American Epi&s;copate, is injurious, both to the Church, and the Bi&s;hops that are to pre&s;ide over it.</HI> But how is it <HI>injurious</HI> to the Church? Why, it &s;eems, by the Limitation of the Bi&s;hops Authority to the Clergy, &s;o that it &s;hall not operate on the Laity. But if the Laity are not to be affected by the Bi&s;hops Autho|rity, they are certainly not to be injured by it; that which does not operate at all, producing no Effect, either injurious or beneficial. With Regard there|fore to the Exerci&s;e of Di&s;cipline over the Laity, no Benefit is propo&s;ed, and no Injury is to be fear|ed; but with Regard to the Government of the Clergy, much Advantage is propo&s;ed, expected and fore&s;een; &s;o that in this Re&s;pect, and upon the whole, the Plan is not <HI>injurious,</HI> but be|neficial, to the American Church. Why no farther

Di&s;cipline is to be exerci&s;ed over the Laity when Bi&s;hops &s;hall be appointed, has been &s;hewn in a former Section, and need not be repeated here. It is thought by much better Judges than either the Doctor or my&s;elf, that it will be more advantageous to the American Church, to leave the Laity as they are, than to introduce any Degree or Species of Di&s;cipline over them, with which Americans are unacquainted.</P>
<P>THE propo&s;ed Plan is repre&s;ented as <HI>injurious to the Bi&s;hops</HI> them&s;elves, becau&s;e thereby <HI>they are, in a meer arbitrary Manner, re&s;trained in the Exerci&s;e of that Authority, which properly belongs to them, both by the apo&s;tolic Appointment, and the Con&s;titu|tion of the Church of England,</HI> p. 143. But if &s;uch a Re&s;traint is not injurious to the Church, it will be difficult to prove that it can be injurious to the Bi&s;hops. Are we to con&s;ider the Authority of Bi&s;hops as &s;o much <HI>private Property,</HI> which belongs to them, and every Limitation of it as &s;o much <HI>Damage</HI> &s;u&s;tained by the Bi&s;hops? And yet, unle&s;s we con&s;ider it under &s;ome &s;uch Idea, I &s;ee not how it can be made out, that any prudent Re&s;traints of their Authority can be an Injury to them. He that is fond of exerci&s;ing Power for the Sake of exer|ci&s;ing it, without regarding whether it tends to E|dification or De&s;truction, is unworthy of it.</P>
<P>OBJECT. 2. <HI>THE Bi&s;hops in this Plan, are &s;o widely different from the Bi&s;hops of the Church of England, that it is not rea&s;onable they &s;hould either be de&s;ired, or &s;ent,</HI> p. 144. The Bi&s;hops in this Plan, are e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame with the Bi&s;hops at Home, how widely &s;oever they may differ in &s;ome Circum&s;tances. But let them be never &s;o different,
<PB N="208" REF="011203_0218_0F95327D2DE999E0">
if &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are propo&s;ed are fitter for the Colonies than &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are in England, and the Doctor will hardly &s;ay that they are not; then, it may be rea&s;onable that they &s;hould be both de|&s;ired, and &s;ent. This I take to be a full and &s;uf|ficient An&s;wer to the Objection as it &s;tands; and what has been before &s;aid, I take to be a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to all the Doctor has offered under this Head, excepting one Con&s;ideration, in p. 146, which may require more particular Notice. The Con&s;ideration is this: That <HI>if Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;ent to the Colonies with the&s;e re&s;trained Powers, unde&s;irable Con&s;equences might be naturally feared, both here, and at home.</HI> The Con&s;equence to be feared here, he tells us, is, that our Bi&s;hops would be unea&s;y under &s;uch a Re&s;traint, and <HI>be di&s;po&s;ed to throw it off as &s;oon as might be.</HI> But was it ever before offered as a Rea&s;on why exorbitant Power &s;hould not be limited, (and &s;uch the Doctor e&s;teems to be the Power of Bi&s;hops in England) becau&s;e the Per&s;ons curtailed would en|deavor to throw off the Re&s;traint, as &s;oon as may be? But why are we to &s;uppo&s;e, that the American Bi&s;hops will be unea&s;y under &s;uch a Limitation of their Power, as the Plan &s;pecifies? Tho&s;e who have been in actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or even in Expectation, of any great and exten&s;ive Power, will naturally be unea&s;y under any remarkable Abridgment of it; but this will not be the Ca&s;e of our American Bi|&s;hops. Whatever Powers or Privileges they &s;hall once po&s;&s;e&s;s, by Virtue of their Office, they will continue to hold, as long as they &s;hall remain in the Office; and as they will know the Terms before they accept of it, there can be no Di&s;appointment. And why &s;hould they be unea&s;y, becau&s;e the Bi&s;hops at home are inve&s;ted with civil Authority? The Bi|&s;hops at home may as properly be unea&s;y and re&s;t|le&s;s,
<PB N="209" REF="011203_0219_0F95327DED8DE168">
becau&s;e they are not, like &s;ome of their Or|der on the Continent of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;overeign Princes. Perhaps the Unea&s;ine&s;s of the American Bi&s;hops may be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from the Reflection, that de&s;titute as they are of civil Power, they are Bi|&s;hops of the &s;ame Church with their Brethren in <HI>England.</HI> But they will not be able to avoid the farther Reflection, that they are Bi&s;hops of the &s;ame Church in <HI>different</HI> Countries, and under <HI>dif|ferent</HI> Circum&s;tances; which e&s;&s;entially alters the Ca&s;e. And no better Rea&s;on can be given, why they &s;hould not be contented with le&s;s Power than belongs to the Bi&s;hops in <HI>England,</HI> than why the other Bi&s;hops in <HI>England</HI> &s;hould not be contented with le&s;s Power than belongs to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Dur|ham.</HI> This &s;ame Kind of rea&s;oning would operate as &s;trongly again&s;t epi&s;copal <HI>Clergymen</HI> in America, as again&s;t Bi&s;hops. The Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> at home, are, in a great Mea&s;ure, &s;upported by Tythes; therefore, it may be &s;aid, if Clergymen of the Church of <HI>England</HI> are once admitted in this Country, under whatever Re&s;trictions and Li|mitations, they will not be ea&s;y, until they &s;hall have &s;ecured to them&s;elves the Tythes of our E&s;tates.</P>
<P>THE Doctor al&s;o mentions Two ill Con&s;equen|ces to be feared at Home: One is, that the Peo|ple there who di&s;like the pre&s;ent Power of the Bi|&s;hops, will be apt to be clamorous, and to make Di&s;turbances, when they &s;hall find that an Epi&s;copate is &s;ettled here in the Form that they de&s;ire, while they are refu&s;ed the like Indulgence in <HI>England.</HI> The Reader can hardly avoid remarking, that here, and in many other Places, the Doctor forgets his proper Bu&s;ine&s;s and Character. His Bu&s;ine&s;s is
<PB N="210" REF="011203_0220_0F95327EB043D9A8">
to an&s;wer the <HI>Appeal</HI> upon the Principles of the Di&s;&s;enters; but in&s;tead of this, he frequently en|deavours to rai&s;e Difficulties and Objections, which cannot properly be made but upon Principles op|po&s;ite to his own, and of tho&s;e whom he repre&s;ents in this Controver&s;y. This &s;hews the Di&s;po&s;ition with which he undertook to oppo&s;e the Epi&s;copate in Que&s;tion, and that he came prepared with a Re&s;olution to object <HI>at any Rate,</HI> rather than not to object at all. It will never be admitted as an Objection <HI>coming from the Di&s;&s;enters</HI> here or in <HI>England,</HI> that many at Home will grow more cla|morous again&s;t the pre&s;ent Power of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops, in Con&s;equence of the Settlement of &s;uch an Epi&s;copate here as is propo&s;ed for the Colonies. But &s;hould the Objection be made by any who have a Right to make it, it is &s;ufficient to refer them to what has been already &s;aid to the Purpo&s;e, viz. That &s;uch an Epi&s;copate may be erected here with Ea&s;e; but it cannot be effected in <HI>England,</HI> without &s;ubverting an E&s;tabli&s;hment, and making a very vi&s;ible Alteration in the national Con&s;titu|tion&mdash;a Work never to be undertaken but in the greate&s;t Extremity, and even then, not without a trembling Hand.</P>
<P>THE other ill Con&s;equence &s;ugge&s;ted is, that the Bi&s;hops in England will be jealous, that an Inva&s;ion of their Authority is farther intended. In Reply to which, I will only remind the Doctor of one Circum&s;tance which he happened to forget; namely, that this very Plan has been formed and introduced by tho&s;e Bi&s;hops them&s;elves, and con|&s;equently, &s;hould they be jealous that any Inva&s;ion of their Power is therein intended, they mu&s;t be jea|lous that they have intended to invade it them&s;elves.</P>

<Q>did not de&s;ire a Toleration, but the <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> of their own Scheme; <HI>&s;uch</HI> an E&s;tabli&s;hment of it as would have kept <HI>all</HI> others, in particular the Lutherans, and the Friends of Edward's Refor|mation, out of the Church; and as they did not de&s;ire a Toleration for them&s;elves, &s;o they <HI>would not grant it to others.</HI> The full E&s;tabli&s;hment of their own Plan, ab&s;olute and univer&s;al Com|pliance with it, without any Favor or Indulgence,

In the la&s;t Century, when they were able to &s;eize upon the Power of the State, they pre&s;&s;ed it into their Service, and according to the Doctrine of their Fathers, an <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> without a Toleration was urged and practiced, as a Matter of indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty. The Doctor's An|ce&s;tors and mine, who planted them&s;elves in New-England, brought with them the &s;ame Principles; upon which they made farther Improvements, not &s;uffering even tho&s;e of their own Per&s;ua&s;ion, except they were <HI>in full Communion</HI> with them, to enjoy &s;ome of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Rights of Engli&s;hmen. The Pre&s;byterians in Scotland, and the Calvini&s;ts in Geneva, Holland and other Places, have al|ways been Friends to religious E&s;tabli&s;hments, and &s;trenuous Advocates for the Magi&s;trate's Protecti|on of the <HI>true</HI> Religion. And I imagine, from certain hi&s;torical Accounts and authentic Anecdotes in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that it mu&s;t have been within a very few Years only, that the Doctor's PRINCIPLE, <HI>again&s;t all civil E&s;tabli&s;hments in Religion,</HI> has been generally adopted New-England, if it has been adopted at all.</P>
<P>I INTIRELY agree with him, that if he, and tho&s;e of his Per&s;ua&s;ion, <HI>do not de&s;ire an E&s;tabli&s;hment in Support of</HI> their own <HI>religious Sentiments,</HI> they <HI>can|not rea&s;onably be blamed, if</HI> they <HI>are not di&s;po&s;ed to encourage one in Favor of the epi&s;copal Coloni&s;ts.</HI> They are not de&s;ired to do this; nay, when it &s;hall appear that the American Epi&s;copalians endeavour to introduce any farther E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church in the Colonies, than it now has, I will not blame them if they <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> it, provided the Oppo&s;ition be

<Q>&s;hall have no Authority, but purely of a &s;piritu|al and eccle&s;ia&s;tical Nature, &s;uch as is derived altogether from the Church and not from the State</Q>

<Q>&s;hall not interfere with the Property or Privileges, whether civil or religious, of Church|men or Di&s;&s;enters</Q>
&mdash;who
<Q>in particular, &s;hall have no Concern with the Probate of Wills, Let|ters of Guardian&s;hip and Admini&s;tration, or Marriage-Licences, nor be Judges of any Ca&s;es relating thereto</Q>

I &s;ay, will the Introduction of &s;uch Bi&s;hops as the&s;e (and no others are propo&s;ed in the Plan, or intended by its Advocates) amount to an E&s;tabli&s;hment? Nay, can it have any more Effect again&s;t the civil or re|ligious Privileges of the Coloni&s;ts, than again&s;t tho&s;e of the <HI>Crim Tartars?</HI> If not; then whatever has been offered upon this Subject in An&s;wer to the Plan, by the Doctor or others, and much has been offered by all that have written again&s;t it, is ab&s;o|lutely foreign from the Point, and has no Manner of Connection with it.</P>

both to the Numbers it now contains, and the Nece&s;&s;ities it is under. But I conceive he mu&s;t be mi&s;taken, as to the Fact. In Penn&s;ylvania, New-Jer&s;ey and New-York, I will not be po&s;itive that the Church has increa&s;ed beyond the Proporti|on of other Denominations, for 50 Years pa&s;t. In &s;ome particular Towns and Di&s;tricts it undoubted|ly has, but perhaps in others it may have propor|tionably decrea&s;ed. But in the New-England Co|lonies, it appears from good Accounts, that the Church has con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, and that the Number of its Profe&s;&s;ors at this Day bears a great|er Proportion to the Number of Inhabitants, than it ever has before. I may be mi&s;taken with Regard to &s;ome of the New-England Colonies; but my Opinion is founded upon credible Report, &s;trength|ened by this Argument&mdash;that it is a common Thing there, for Families of Di&s;&s;enters to conform to the Church; whereas it &s;eldom happens that a Family is known to leave the Church, and join with the Di&s;&s;enters. But as to Connecticut, of which I can judge from my own Ob&s;ervation, the Church has increa&s;ed there mo&s;t amazingly, for 20 or 30 Years pa&s;t. I cannot at pre&s;ent recollect an Example, in any Age or Country, wherein &s;o great a Proportion of Pro&s;elytes has been made to any Religion in &s;o &s;hort a Time, as has been made to the Church of England in the We&s;tern Divi&s;ion of that populous Colony; unle&s;s where the Power of Miracles or the Arm of the Magi&s;trate was exerted to produce that Effect. This Progre&s;s of the Church has greatly alarmed the more rigid Di&s;&s;en|ters in New-England; and however the good Doc|tor may affect to de&s;pi&s;e it, I think that I can di&s;cover, in &s;ome of his late Writings, that he is not a little alarmed by it him&s;elf.</P>

Under this Head he argues again&s;t an E|pi&s;copate, from the American Church's being yet in its <HI>Infancy</HI>&mdash;in &s;uch a feeble State as not to be <HI>able to &s;tand upon its own Legs</HI>&mdash;and, in &s;hort, as being &s;o far from <HI>a State of Maturity, as</HI> not <HI>to make it</HI> WORTH WHILE <HI>for a Bi&s;hop to come here.</HI> But infant and feeble as She is, he has allowed that She my be 270,000 &s;trong in the Colonies, exclu|&s;ive of the I&s;lands, after reducing her Numbers as low as po&s;&s;ible. Now can he po&s;&s;ibly think, when he allows him&s;elf Time for Con&s;ideration, that the Church of England in America, containing 270,000 Members (be&s;ides many Thou&s;ands more in the I|&s;lands) in which are included mo&s;t of the Gover|nors and principal Per&s;ons in the Colonies, is &s;o in|con&s;iderable, that it is not <HI>worth while</HI> for a Bi&s;hop to take Charge of it? Would he look upon an e|qual Number of any People upon Earth, however low in their Circum&s;tances, or however light when weighed in the political Ballance, in &s;o contempti|ble a Light?</P>

But before he makes this <HI>Exit,</HI> he complains that I &s;uffered what was <HI>wrote in An&s;wer to this very Plan,</HI> by Dr. Mayhew, to lie unan&s;wered, without having <HI>li&s;ped a Word in Reply to him.</HI> This Appearance is again&s;t me, I freely confe&s;s. It was the profe&s;&s;ed Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Appeal</HI> to obviate and remove Objections again&s;t an American Epi&s;copate, and Dr. Mayhew was too con&s;iderable a Writer to be overlooked. But the DEFENCES of his <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> I had not then &s;een; and although I made much Inquiry, and &s;ent as far as into Connecticut, I was unable to pro|cure them. I was told however by one that had read them, that they contained nothing material upon the Subject, but what had been &s;ufficiently an&s;wered by Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> and nothing but what I had con&s;idered in the Cour&s;e of my Papers; upon which Information I proceeded to publi&s;h. This Excu&s;e I now offer to the Public, not doubting of its being candidly accepted. But what Excu&s;e can Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> make, for taking no Notice of what was <HI>powerfully offered</HI> by Mr. Apthorp, in An&s;wer to the&s;e very Objections of Dr. Mayhew, and for <HI>not having li&s;ped a Word in Reply to him?</HI> Was it treating his Readers generou&s;ly, or fairly, or ho|ne&s;tly, to pre&s;ent them with Dr. Mayhew's Objec|tions, broadly hinting, although not directly a&s;&s;ert|ing, that they had not been an&s;wered; when he mu&s;t have known, that they had not only been an&s;|wered, but that no Reply had been made to the An&s;wer?

be given of this Conduct, he mu&s;t bear the Re|proach of it, as well as he can.</P>
<P>BEFORE he introduces Dr. Mayhew, he <HI>&s;ugge&s;ts an Expedient to compromi&s;e Matters between Epi&s;co|palians, and other Denominations, in the Colonies,</HI> p. 158. The Expedient is, that the King &s;hould grant a Commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ome of the epi&s;copal Cler|gy here, to perform all the Offices of a Bi&s;hop. Every plau&s;ible Expedient for compromi&s;ing Dif|ferences between the various Denominations of Chri&s;tians, ought to be attended to; but Plau&s;ibi|lity cannot be predicated of this. It can neither an&s;wer the Ends of the Epi&s;copalians, nor even tho&s;e of the Projector and his Adherents. The Powers wanted by the American Church are
<Q>pure|ly of a &s;piritual Nature,</Q>
which therefore the King cannot give; &s;uch Authority as can be given by the King, is altogether <HI>temporal,</HI> which is the very Thing that the Di&s;&s;enters dread: So that nei|ther Epi&s;copalians nor Di&s;&s;enters, can po&s;&s;ibly ac|quie&s;ce in the Expedient.</P>
<P>I SHALL now lay before the Reader Mr. Ap|thorp's Reply to what has been produced from Dr. Mayhew on the Subject; fir&s;t begging that worthy Gentleman's Pardon, for making free with his Property.</P>
<P>"THE Doctor affects to doubt, &s;ays Mr. Ap|thorp, whether the Scheme propo&s;ed by his An&s;|werer, be not merely his own; in&s;tead of being, as is a&s;&s;erted, the real and only one that has been in View; and &s;ays, that if this A&s;&s;ertion be true, he and others have been mi&s;informed. Therefore, let his or their Informers &s;ay on what Grounds
<PB N="221" REF="011203_0231_0F953287AF3305E8">
they have ever affirmed a different one to have been framed; or el&s;e let them take Shame to them&s;elves, for inventing Fal&s;hoods, or venting Imaginations for Facts; and let the Doctor &s;et a Mark on them, and be more cautious whom he believes hereafter."</P>
<P>"SUCCESSIVE Propo&s;als for American Bi&s;hops have been made at different Times, through a long Cour&s;e of Years, by Men of high Rank and Cha|racter in the Church; and are ready now for the Peru&s;al of any worthy Per&s;on, who &s;hall declare him&s;elf un&s;atisfied in this Point: All which agree with what the <HI>An&s;werer</HI> has avered. One of them perhaps may have peculiar Weight with the Doctor; I mean that made in the Year 1750, by the excel|lent Bi&s;hop BUTLER, in the Doctor's own Judg|ment
<Q>a great Ornament of the Epi&s;copal Order, and of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></Q>
This Scheme, with which the Writer was favored by a Gentleman of Di&s;tinction in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> is <HI>in the Bi&s;hop's own hand|writing,</HI> of which the following is an exact Tran|&s;cript."</P>
<P N="1">I.
<Q>THAT no coercive Power is de&s;ired over the Laity in any Ca&s;e; but only a Power to re|gulate the Behavior of the Clergy who are in epi&s;copal Orders; and to correct and puni&s;h them according to the Law of the Church of England, in Ca&s;e of Mi&s;behavior or Neglect of Duty, with &s;uch Powers as the Commi&s;&s;aries a|broad have exerci&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P N="2">II.
<Q>THAT nothing is de&s;ired for &s;uch Bi&s;hops, that may in the lea&s;t interfere with the Dignity, or Authority, or Intere&s;t, of the Governor, or any other Officer of State. Probates of Wills, Li|cence
<PB N="222" REF="011203_0232_0F9532886F2F6FF0">
for Marriages, &amp;c. to be left in the Hands where they are: And <HI>no Share in the temporal Government is de&s;ired for Bi&s;hops.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3">III.
<Q><HI>THE Maintenance of &s;uch Bi&s;hops not to be at the Charge of the Colonies.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="4">IV.
<Q>No Bi&s;hops are intended to be &s;ettled in Places where the Government is in the Hands of Di&s;&s;enters, as in New-England, &amp;c. But Au|thority to be given, ONLY to ordain Clergy for &s;uch Church of England Congregations as are among them, and to in&s;pect into the Manners and Behavior of the &s;aid Clergy, and to confirm the Members thereof.</Q></P>
<P>"THIS Plan is &s;o exactly &s;imilar to that in the <HI>An&s;wer to</HI> Dr. Mayhew'<HI>s Ob&s;ervations,</HI> that it can|not be doubted, they are the &s;ame, and that it is the only one intended to be put in Execution. And it is &s;uch a &s;imple and beautiful Model of the mo&s;t ancient and moderate Epi&s;copacy, that it &s;hould, not only remove all the Doctor's Apprehen&s;ions, but the Scruples of every rational and learned Di&s;&s;enter again&s;t that apo&s;tolic Form of Govern|ment."</P>
<P>"SUPPOSING this to be the real Scheme, the Doctor owns that it &s;ets the Matter in a le&s;s excep|tionable Point of View, than he had &s;een it in be|fore. Yet he cannot forbear going 50 Years back, to ridicule &s;ome harmle&s;s, though ill-cho&s;en, Phra|&s;es, in which the Sub&s;tance of it is expre&s;&s;ed; and expo&s;e to &s;corn, with burle&s;que Gravity, what he calls a Matter
<Q>&s;o &s;ublime, my&s;terious and &s;acred, as the Impo&s;ition of the Bi&s;hop's Hands.</Q>
Yet,
<PB N="223" REF="011203_0233_0F9532892F4FD8D0">
he well knows, or ea&s;ily may, that we a&s;cribe no more Efficacy to the laying on of Bi&s;hops' Hands, than his Brethren do to the laying on of Pre&s;byters' Hands. And if we apprehend our&s;elves bound to admit it in one Office, which they have rejected, I mean Confirmation; we may indeed be mi&s;taken in it, but &s;urely cannot be Objects of Deri&s;ion for it. The &s;ame is the Ca&s;e of epi&s;copal Ordination, and epi&s;copal Vi&s;itation of the Clergy of our Church. We think them all appointed, and u&s;eful to us: We are &s;ure they are injurious to no other Per&s;ons. And therefore according to tho&s;e Principles, for which the Doctor avows the warme&s;t Zeal; we are en|titled to have the&s;e Offices performed for us by Per&s;ons of that Order, to which we conceive they are committed: El&s;e, we do not enjoy
<Q>that full entire Liberty in religious Matters,</Q>
which the Doctor de&s;ires for him&s;elf, and
<Q>which all Men, who&s;e Principles or Practices are not in|con&s;i&s;tent with the Safety of Society, he &s;ays, have a Right to enjoy.</Q>
He tells us indeed, that we do enjoy it without American Bi&s;hops, "though under &s;ome <HI>Inconveniences,</HI>" as he gently calls them. The BUFFOONERY that immediately follows, in Order to prevent any Compa&s;&s;ion for our Ca&s;e, I omit. So he thinks we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ufficiently of the whole Exerci&s;e of our Religion, becau&s;e our young People may be confirmed, and Clergymen ordained for us, and properly in&s;pected afterwards; provided they will all go from Ameri|ca to Europe for the&s;e Purpo&s;es. Can the Doctor &s;ay with a good Con&s;cience, that Liberty like this is all that he &s;hould de&s;ire for him&s;elf and his Brethren? Let me intreat him to read over again &s;ome Words of his <HI>An&s;werer,</HI> to which he has made no Reply: Whether, becau&s;e they de&s;erve
<PB N="224" REF="011203_0234_0F953289F00D6C10">
none, or becau&s;e they admit of none, let others judge.
<Q>The American Di&s;&s;enters from our Com|munion, would think it in&s;upportably grievous to have no Mini&s;ters but &s;uch as received Ordi|nation in England or Ireland; or to be withheld from the U&s;e of any religious Rite, which they e&s;teemed as highly as we do Confirmation; or to have their Churches de&s;titute of a Superinten|dency, which they conceived to be of apo&s;toli|cal In&s;titution. <HI>I</HI> &s;hould in &s;uch a Ca&s;e be a zea|lous Advocate for them, as not yet enjoying the full Toleration to which they had a Right. And &s;urely they ought to a&s;k their Con&s;ciences very &s;eriou&s;ly, why they oppo&s;e our Application for &s;uch Indulgence, as they would claim for them&s;elves; and whether indeed &s;uch Oppo&s;ition is not downright Per&s;ecution; and that, in a Matter merely &s;piritual, without the Mixture of any temporal Concern.</Q>
<HI>An&s;.</HI> p. 60.</P>
<P>"THE Doctor, &s;till flying to Ridicule in Defect of Argument, intimates, how much the Epi&s;|copalians in America need to be <HI>well ruled</HI> and <HI>governed,</HI>&mdash;how much the Clergy need to be <HI>united,</HI> and reduced <HI>to Order.</HI> On which I would only ob&s;erve, that the American Clergy are known to be unanimous in their Wi&s;hes to be under the immediate In&s;pection of Bi&s;hops re&s;ident among them: Which Concurrence implies quite the con|trary to a pre&s;ent di&s;orderly State of that Clergy; who are perhaps, as faithful to their Tru&s;t, and as blamele&s;s in their Manners, as any Body of Men in the Chri&s;tian Mini&s;try."</P>
<P>"HE &s;ays, that great Inconveniences are likely to follow from the &s;ending Bi&s;hops to America.
<PB N="225" REF="011203_0235_0F95328AAEDBFCA8">
But he &s;ays al&s;o,
<Q>It is readily owned that our Apprehen&s;ion of what may po&s;&s;ibly or probably be the Con&s;equences of it, ought not to put us on infringing the religious Liberty of our Fel|low-Subjects and Chri&s;tian Brethren.</Q>
Nay, he adds,
<Q>neither have we any Power to do &s;o; if we were <HI>unrea&s;onable and wicked enough to de&s;ire it</HI>; our Charter granting &s;uch Liberty to <HI>all Prote&s;|tants.</HI></Q>
Therefore, Bi&s;hops may, by that Char|ter, &s;ettle even in New-England. And if the having Bi&s;hops among them be Part of the religious Li|berty of the Epi&s;copalians, as it evidently is; the Di&s;&s;enters ought not to oppo&s;e it on Account of apprehended Con&s;equences: Much le&s;s ought they to oppo&s;e the Settlement of them in other Provin|ces, totally independent on New-England; or their re&s;orting to the New-England Epi&s;copalians occa|&s;ionally. For any Thing of this Kind would be <HI>doing evil</HI> on Pretence <HI>that good may come</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> III.8.</NOTE>."</P>
<P><Q>BUT why are bad Con&s;equences apprehended? Bi&s;hops, he tells us, are ambitious and unquiet.</Q>
But &s;o are Pre&s;byters, and all Sorts of Men too often. Bi&s;hops partake of ju&s;t the &s;ame Nature with the Re&s;t of the Species: And the Doctor will own, that they are now, and long have been, as quiet an Order of Men, as any in his Nation. But who knows whether they will continue &s;o? And who can know with Certainty any &s;uch Thing concerning any Per&s;ons whatever? Who knows whether the New-Englanders will not <HI>hang Quakers</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the excellent and truly Honourable Mr. <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI>'s Hi&s;t. of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> p. 187, 196, 320.</NOTE> and Witches again? But why &s;hould either be &s;u&s;pect|ed? The Clergy of England are in general Friends
<PB N="226" REF="011203_0236_0F95328B6E456DB0">
to religious Freedom: The People of England, Whigs and Tories, are unfavorable to clerical Power; and a far greater Danger, than the Doc|tor's imaginary one, is, that of their laying a&s;ide all Regard to the Chri&s;tian Mini&s;try, in every Shape, and to Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf. Surely then, there never was &s;o little Pro&s;pect, that a Spirit of reli|gious Intolerance would revive here. Or if it &s;hould, it might not extend to New-England; for it did not, in the Reigns of JAMES and CHARLES the Fir&s;t. But even &s;uppo&s;ing it to reach thither, its Effects would be very little dimini&s;hed by the Cir|cum&s;tance of no Bi&s;hops being already placed in America. They might &s;oon be &s;ent, and with much greater Authority than is a&s;ked for them now; <HI>and perhaps with &s;ome</HI> RESENTMENT <HI>at the Oppo&s;ition made to them before.</HI> But the whole Ap|prehen&s;ion is groundle&s;s. The Engli&s;h Di&s;&s;enters, who have Six and Twenty Bi&s;hops e&s;tabli&s;hed a|mong them, fear no Harm from them. Why then &s;hould the New-England Di&s;&s;enters fear any, if one or two &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, with much le&s;s Power, in one or two neighboring Provinces? Tho&s;e Pro|vinces are not inhabited by Bigots; far from it. Governors, A&s;&s;emblies, Di&s;&s;enters, nay Church|men, and even Clergymen, would be all on their Guard again&s;t epi&s;copal Encroachments. Add to this, that &s;o public a Declaration as has been made of the Model of Epi&s;copacy, propo&s;ed to be fol|lowed in America, will it&s;elf be an effectual Bar|rier again&s;t any undue Exten&s;ion of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power; of which the Doctor affects to be &s;o ap|prehen&s;ive."&mdash;</P>
<P>"BUT he has one Objection again&s;t Bi&s;hops in our Colonies, which I had almo&s;t overlooked. He
<PB N="227" REF="011203_0237_0F95328C305A0D40">
knows not how they are to be <HI>maintained.</HI>
<Q>Nor, as he thinks, will they run this Ri&s;que, unle&s;s they have more Faith in God, and le&s;s Love to the World, than mo&s;t of their Order have had, &s;ince <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great became a <HI>nur&s;ing Fa|ther</HI> to the Church, and the pious maternal Coun|cil of <HI>Nice</HI> &s;uckled her with the clear and pure, the uncorrupt and <HI>&s;incere Milk</HI> of <HI>Homo&ouml;u&s;ianity,</HI> that &s;he might grow <HI>thereby.</HI></Q>
One might be at a Lo&s;s to find out the A&s;&s;ociation of Ideas be|tween the Doctrine of the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> and the Maintenance of Bi&s;hops in <HI>America.</HI> We can only &s;uppo&s;e that the Doctor has an equal Love for them both. But if no proper Maintenance can be found for them, he needs not be unea&s;y at the Pro|ject of &s;ending them: And that it is not to be at the Expence of the Colonies, he has &s;een in Bi&s;hop <HI>Butler</HI>'s Scheme, with which the others agree."</P>
<P>"HE imagines that appointing Bi&s;hops for A|merica, would probably increa&s;e the epi&s;copal Par|ty there; and then great Evils might follow. I can|not di&s;cern in what other Way it can increa&s;e that Party, than by &s;upplying them more ea&s;ily with a competent Number of Mini&s;ters; taking Care that tho&s;e Mini&s;ters &s;hould be diligent and exemplary; and promoting an early Sen&s;e of Piety among their young People. The&s;e are no Evils; and what can one or two Bi&s;hops, on a Continent 600 Miles long, do be&s;ides? The Doctor &s;ays indeed, that Pretexts might ea&s;ily be found for enlarging their Powers, and increa&s;ing their Number. But enlarging their Powers would immediately rai&s;e a Clamour that could not be with&s;tood. If a few Bi&s;hops proved di&s;agreeable, more would not be added. And though they &s;hould prove agreeable
<PB N="228" REF="011203_0238_0F95328CEE0FDAD8">
and u&s;eful; more would be &s;ent, only to &s;uch Pro|vinces as cho&s;e them. In the &s;hort Stay which one of them would choo&s;e to make in New-England, he could not bring over many Per&s;ons to our Church. And therefore how terrible Things &s;oever Epi&s;copalians, if they &s;hould become the Majori|ty, may attempt and perform there, they will be almo&s;t, if not quite, as likely to accompli&s;h, without ever &s;eeing a Bi&s;hop among them, as with &s;eeing one now and then. But indeed there is very little Likeli|hood of their ever becoming the Majority there; and &s;till le&s;s, of their carrying Points in their own Favor, as the Doctor fancies they may, while they continue a Minority; for all Parties, though di|vided among them&s;elves, will be &s;ure to unite a|gain&s;t them. Nay, had they Power, there is no Rea&s;on to think they would be oppre&s;&s;ive; for they are not oppre&s;&s;ive in the Colonies where they actu|ally have it: Or that they would attempt&mdash;for they could not, with any Mode&s;ty, or any Hope of Succe&s;s&mdash;&s;uch Laws again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, as the Di&s;&s;enters have not attempted again&s;t them. And if the Zeal of the New-England Clergy threatens any Danger, Bi&s;hops would temper it, as they have done in England, in&s;tead of inflaming it. Therefore upon the whole, I hope the Doctor will, on con&s;idering farther, endeavor to reconcile our Countrymen to their Admi&s;&s;ion: A Reque&s;t, in my Opinion, &s;omewhat more rea&s;onable than his, that the Society &s;hould reconcile the Members of our Church to being contented <HI>without</HI> epi&s;copal MINISTERS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI>'s REVIEW of Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI>'s REMARKS on the ANSWER to his <HI>Ob&s;ervations on the Charter and Conduct of the Society,</HI> &amp;c. p. 54&mdash;62.</NOTE>."</P>

<P>I AM unable to account for &s;o great a Confu&s;ion of Ideas, as di&s;covers it&s;elf in the two next Para|graphs. The Doctor &s;eems very &s;trenuou&s;ly to deny, that the Church of England in America has any RIGHT to the Epi&s;copate propo&s;ed: But then he declares him&s;elf perfectly willing that we &s;hould have it&mdash;choo&s;ing perhaps that it &s;hould be granted us as a Matter of Favor, rather than of Right. But what need is there of this Di&s;tinction, and to what Purpo&s;e will it &s;erve, if it is not to operate again&s;t us? Our Claim is, that we may be upon an equal Footing with the other religious Denominations in America. In Order to this, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we be allowed the Enjoyment of our eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution, in the &s;ame compleat Manner as it is enjoyed by them. Of our eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Con&s;titution Bi&s;hops make an e&s;&s;ential Part; and therefore, without an Epi&s;copate we cannot enjoy it. Our Claim is ju&s;tified by the common Principles of human Nature, of the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion, and of civil Society. We call it a RIGHT, becau&s;e all good Writers agree in calling a Claim thus founded by that Name. But for Words we do not contend. What we in&s;i&s;t upon is this, and no more than this&mdash;that the Church of England is, in all Re&s;pects, fairly intitled to as <HI>full</HI> a Toleration in the Colonies, as other Churches in the Colonies
<PB N="230" REF="011203_0240_0F95328F2DA97400">
enjoy; and it cannot be thus tolerated, unle&s;s it be &s;uffered to exi&s;t in all its Parts. It is therefore the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our Opponents to &s;hew, that we are an Exception from the general Rule, and that we ought not to be treated in the &s;ame equal Man|ner with others. Unle&s;s they are able to &s;hew this, they cannot prove that our Reque&s;t for Bi&s;hops is unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ays the Doctor, p. 180, the American E|pi&s;copalians <HI>want to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by having Bi|&s;hops upon the Footing of a</HI> STATE-ESTABLISHMENT. If we want what is unrea&s;onable, &s;o far it is right to oppo&s;e us; but &s;till our rea&s;onable Wants or De&s;ires ought to be gratified.

<P>THE Doctor affects to doubt, p. 181, whether <HI>the late Dr. Samuel Chandler</HI>
<Q>gave his Con&s;ent to, and Approbation of, American Bi&s;hops, in the Manner they have been reque&s;ted.</Q>
But a Per&s;on of high Rank and equal Integrity, in a Letter dated <HI>May</HI> 1764, &s;ays,
<Q>Lord Willoughby of Parham, the <HI>only Di&s;&s;enting Peer,</HI> and Dr. Chand|ler, have declared, after our Scheme (for Ame|rican Bi&s;hops) was fully laid before them, that they &s;aw no objections again&s;t it:</Q>
And a Gen|tleman who is now in America, was pre&s;ent at the Conver&s;ation in which the latter made that De|claration, and has heard him expre&s;s the &s;ame Sentiments on other Occa&s;ions. Well then, if it was &s;o, the Doctor <HI>wonders at it,</HI> and accounts for it by <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing, that he was too complai&s;ant to &s;ome high Dignitary of the Church.</HI> But why &s;hould he <HI>wonder</HI> at it? Whoever is acquainted with the candid and generous Sentiments of that eminent Di&s;&s;enter, would much rather wonder, if he had not approved of a Plan, &s;o beneficial to the Church, while it is harmle&s;s to all. To &s;uppo&s;e him over-complai&s;ant to any Dignitary of the Church, is more than we can &s;uppo&s;e would be the Ca&s;e of &s;ome of his Brethren, on this Side the Atlantic.

<Q>that the Epi&s;copate pro|po&s;ed cannot hurt the Di&s;&s;enters, and is free from all rea&s;onable Objections.</Q>
In An&s;wer to this Section, in&s;tead of replying to any Thing ad|vanced in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> the Doctor begins, with combating his own Phantom of a <HI>State-E&s;tabli&s;h|ment</HI>; of which, no more is needful to be &s;aid. He then introduces the <HI>fictitious</HI> Addre&s;s to the U|niver&s;ity of Cambridge, in Order to confront me with a Pa&s;&s;age, which I do again a&s;&s;ure him was not contained in any Addre&s;s of our Convention to that Univer&s;ity, or to any other Body of Men, or to any &s;ingle Per&s;on.</P>
<P>IN Oppo&s;ition to what was &s;aid of the
<Q>Mild|ne&s;s, Tenderne&s;s and Moderation of the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops, for a long Cour&s;e of Years</Q>
pa&s;t, the Doctor tells us, p. 187, of the Rejection of <HI>the Pe|tition of the Pre&s;byterian Church at New-York for a Charter from the King</HI>; the Mi&s;carriage of which he &s;uppo&s;es to have been owing to the Interpo&s;iti|on of the Lord Bi&s;hop of London. I have no Concern in that Affair, and am not very particu|larly acquainted with it. But according to the New-York Gentleman's Account of it, which the Doctor has in&s;erted, it appears, that the <HI>Grant</HI> of the <HI>Favor</HI> was con&s;idered as <HI>a Breach of the Coro|nation Oath</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>One Branch of the Coronation Oath is in the following Words. The Archbi&s;hop or Bi&s;hop a&s;ks:
<Q>Will You to the utmo&s;t of your Power maintain the Laws of God, the true Profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel, and the Prote&s;tant reformed Re|ligion e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Law?

of <HI>Trade, that general Policy was again&s;t</HI> the Peti|tioners <HI>having greater Privileges than are allowed by the Laws of Toleration.</HI> How far the Grant would have interfered with the King's Coronation Oath, it becomes not me to &s;ay; tho&s;e to whom it was refered were the proper Judges; and in <HI>their</HI> Opi|nion the Petition could not con&s;i&s;tently be granted. It is the unque&s;tionable Duty of his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t honorable <HI>Privy Council,</HI> to advi&s;e him again&s;t what|ever is thought by them to imply <HI>a Breach of the Coro|nation Oath</HI>; it is a Duty more peculiarly incumbent upon any &s;uch Bi&s;hops as his Maje&s;ty thinks fit to call up to that high Tru&s;t. If therefore the Bi&s;hop of London, upon the above Principle, was it more active than others in oppo&s;ing the Mea&s;ure, it was becau&s;e his Station required it. If <HI>general Policy,</HI> in the Opinion of the Lords of Trade, was al&s;o again&s;t the Grant, they were obliged to di&s;counte|nance it; and the Petitioners, I conceive, ought to re&s;t &s;atisfied, e&s;pecially as it was a Matter of <HI>meer Favor,</HI> which was reque&s;ted, and more than was thought to be allowed by <HI>the Laws of Tolera|tion.</HI> I have been moreover told, that be&s;ides the Rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned, a <HI>particular Policy,</HI> with Regard to the Pre&s;byterians in New-York, concurred to defeat the Petition. It was the Belief at Home, that the Church of England had been treated with peculiar Malevolence, by &s;ome of tho&s;e very Per|&s;ons
<PB N="235" REF="011203_0245_0F953292F01C3538">
who&s;e Names were annexed to the Petition. It was therefore not unnatural to &s;u&s;pect, that any additional Power put into the Hands of &s;uch Per&s;ons, would, as Opportunity &s;hould offer, be exerted again&s;t the Church.</P>
<P>IN Proof of the pre&s;ent mild Spirit of the Church of England and of the Prelates who pre|&s;ide over it, Reference was made in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> to the general Sen&s;e of it confe&s;&s;ed by the Di&s;&s;enters at Home.
<Q>The late Dr. G. Ben&s;on, a very learn|ed Di&s;&s;enter,</Q>
was given as an In&s;tance to this Pur|po&s;e; who
<Q>did not &s;cruple to make the following Declaration:</Q>
<Q>The Church of England, with its pre&s;ent Candor, Spirit of Toleration and Charity, appears to me, to be the be&s;t E&s;tabli&s;h|ment on the Face of the Earth.</Q>
Here the <HI>Pre&s;byter in Old England</HI> furiou&s;ly falls upon me, charging me with having been guilty of a Mi&s;quota|tion, and an <HI>artful Deception,</HI> thereby <HI>impo&s;ing upon the Americans.</HI> Take it in his own Words: <HI>Our Mi&s;|&s;ionary</HI> (Pray, Mr. <HI>Pre&s;byter,</HI> why <HI>your</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionary?) <HI>ought to have given the Te&s;timony its full Scope; for the&s;e are the Words of Dr. Ben&s;on following in im|mediate Connection</HI>&mdash;
<Q>to which I would conform mo&s;t gladly and with all my Soul, provided they would admit me, without requiring any Thing, which appears to me unrea&s;onable, or un&s;crip|tural. But, as long as &s;uch Things are con|tained in her Articles, and mixed with every Part of the common Forms of Wor&s;hip,</Q>
(meaning, I &s;u&s;pect, the Doctrine of the Trinity)
<Q>my Con&s;cience obliges me to di&s;&s;ent, and avoid Communion with her. I &s;incerely wi&s;h her a thorough Reformation, and that &s;peedily.</Q>
<HI>What mu&s;t now be thought of this Mi&s;&s;ionary from the
<PB N="236" REF="011203_0246_0F953293AF6B2900">
Society, thus impo&s;ing on the Americans, not capable, for the general, of coming at Dr. Ben&s;on's Book, nor of detecting the mi&s;repre&s;ented Te&s;timony; which when fairly given, is as full again&s;t his Church Sy&s;tem, as the Power of Language can expre&s;s.</HI> This is the Ob|jection, in <HI>its full Scope.</HI> Before I &s;aw this <HI>Pre&s;by|ter</HI>'s Performance, a Friend who had read it, upon my Inquiry, told me, that he met in it with but one Pa&s;&s;age that could de&s;erve Notice; which is the Pa&s;&s;age I have quoted. When I came to &s;ee it, it appeard to me to be in it&s;elf not worthy of a Reply, as I &s;till think; however as &s;ome officious Zealot has cau&s;ed it to be re-printed in one of the Bo&s;ton Papers, for this Rea&s;on it may be proper briefly to an&s;wer it.</P>
<P>Whenever an Author is quoted, to &s;hew his Opi|nion upon any particular Point, common Sen&s;e teaches us that it is unfair to quote him imperfectly; or in &s;uch a Manner that his Opinion on that Point is mi&s;|repre&s;ented. At the &s;ame Time, no Per&s;on of com|mon Sen&s;e will quote farther than relates to the Point under Con&s;ideration. Let us then examine, for what Purpo&s;e Dr. Ben&s;on was quoted in the <HI>Ap|peal</HI>; from whence only we mu&s;t judge whether he was quoted fairly or not. Now if any one will be at the Trouble of turning to the <HI>Appeal,</HI> p. 90, he will &s;ee, that his Te&s;timony was manife&s;tly produced, as an Evidence of the
<Q>Mildne&s;s, Tenderne&s;s and Moderation</Q>
of 'the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops' for a 'Cour&s;e of Years' pa&s;t; and for no other Pur|po&s;e. But had Dr. Ben&s;on ever declared his Opi|nion upon this Point? Yes, directly and fully, in in the Words quoted. Did the Quotation include the <HI>whole</HI> of his Declaration, and fairly expre&s;s the <HI>whole</HI> of his Opinion? I affirm that it includ|ed every Word relating to the Subject, and con&s;e|quently
<PB N="237" REF="011203_0247_0F9532947020F028">
conveyed the whole of his Opinion there|upon, &s;o far as he thought proper to expre&s;s it. What then is the <HI>Pre&s;byter</HI>'s Objection? That I gave not the Te&s;timony <HI>its full Scope.</HI> In what Manner does he attempt to &s;upport it? He al|ledges my Omi&s;&s;ion of Words that follow <HI>in imme|diate Connection</HI> with tho&s;e quoted. What is the Tendency of the Words omited? To account for Dr. Ben&s;on's not conforming to the Church. Was the Rea&s;on then of his not conforming, that the Church appeared to him to be defective in Mild|ne&s;s and Moderation? No, a quite different Thing, it was becau&s;e
<Q>&s;uch Things are contained in her Articles,</Q>
&amp;c. as appeared to him to be
<Q>un|rea&s;onable or un&s;criptural.</Q>
The Objector was able to &s;ee this, for he ob&s;erves that the Words omited contain a Te&s;timony&mdash;again&s;t what? Why, not again&s;t the Moderation of the Bi&s;hops and Clergy, the only Thing then in Que&s;tion; but&mdash; again&s;t the <HI>Church-Sy&s;tem.</HI> I am &s;orry that he was not able al&s;o to &s;ee, that I was not upon the Sub|ject of <HI>Church-Sy&s;tems,</HI> but of the Church of Eng|land's Mildne&s;s to Di&s;&s;enters:&mdash;And that I might, with as much Propriety, have quoted any other Pa&s;&s;age in the whole Book, as that which I am blamed for omiting, although it was <HI>in immediate Connection</HI> with the Sentence tran&s;cribed. It is now &s;ubmitted to the Reader, whether my Quotation was unfair, or the Pre&s;byter's Animadver&s;ion unju&s;t and impertinent.</P>
<P>FROM the Engli&s;h Di&s;&s;enters, I pa&s;&s;ed on to &s;hew the favorable Opinion of the Church of England, which was entertained by &s;ome of the mo&s;t emi|nent Reformers and foreign Prote&s;tants; and by CALVIN among&s;t others. In An&s;wer to this, Dr.
<PB N="238" REF="011203_0248_0F95329530504558">
<HI>Chauncy</HI> denies that Calvin had any Friend&s;hip for Epi&s;copacy. <HI>The plain Truth is,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Calvin was in Principle as real an Enemy to the divine Right of Epi&s;copacy, as to the divine Right of Popes,</HI> p. 188. But Enemy as he was, to &s;ay nothing now of his Te&s;timony in Favor of Epi&s;copacy which was produced in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> he acknowledges that it was the Government of all the Churches upon Earth, from the Times of the Apo&s;tles, for 1500 Years together<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In&s;tit. Lib. IV. Cap. IV. Sect. 2.</NOTE>.
<Q>But his extraordinary Opinion of E|pi&s;copacy will farther appear in a Letter, which he and Bullinger, and other learned Men beyond Sea, wrote <HI>Anno</HI> 1549 to King Edward the Sixth, offering to make him their Defender, and to have Bi&s;hops in their Churches for better Unity and Concord among&s;t them, as may be &s;een in Mr. Strype's Memorial of Archbi&s;hop Cranmer; as likewi&s;e, by a Writing of Archbi&s;hop Abbot's, found among&s;t the Manu&s;cripts of Archbi&s;hop U&s;her<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">An&s;wer to Peirce, p, 17.</NOTE>.</Q>
Archbi&s;hop Abbot's Manu&s;cript, to which the learned An&s;werer of Peirce refers, in the above Pa&s;&s;age, has the following Words:
<Q>Pe|ru&s;ing &s;ome Papers of our Predece&s;&s;or Matthew Parker, we find that John Calvin, and others of the prote&s;tant Churches of Germany and el&s;e|where, would have had Epi&s;copacy, if permit|ted.&mdash;And whereas John Calvin had &s;ent a Let|ter in King Edward the Sixth's Reign, to have conferred with the Clergy of England about &s;ome Things to this Effect, two (popi&s;h) Bi&s;hops, viz. Gardiner and Bonner, <HI>intercepted</HI> the &s;ame; whereby Mr. Calvin's Offerture peri&s;hed. And he received an An&s;wer, as if it had been from the reformed Divines of tho&s;e Times; wherein
<PB N="239" REF="011203_0249_0F953295EDC3D5E8">
they checked him, and &s;lighted his Propo&s;als. From which Time John Calvin and the Church of England were at Variance in &s;everal Points; which othewi&s;e through God's Mercy had been qualified, if tho&s;e Papers of his Propo&s;als had been di&s;covered unto the Queen's Maje&s;ty during John Calvin's Life. But being not di&s;covered until, or about the &s;ixth Year of her Maje&s;ty's Reign, her Maje&s;ty much lamented they were not found &s;ooner: Which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed before her Council at the &s;ame Time, in the Pre&s;ence of her great Friends Sir Henry Sidney, and Sir William Cecil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Parker, p. 70,</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>ALMOST all the foreign Prote&s;tants, of any Di&s;tinction, have been Friends to Epi&s;copacy; al|though many of them have been unable to obtain that primitive Form of Government for their Churches.
<Q>Luther profe&s;&s;es that if the popi&s;h Bi&s;hops would cea&s;e to per&s;ecute the Go&s;pel, we would acknowledge them as our Fathers, and willingly obey their Authority, <HI>which we find &s;upported by the Word of God.</HI></Q>
<Q><HI>Melancthon</HI> lays the Blame on the Cruelty of the popi&s;h Bi|&s;hops, that that canonical Polity was de&s;troyed, which, &s;aith he, <HI>we &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired to pre&s;erve:</HI> And bid the Papi&s;ts con&s;ider what Account they will render to God for thus &s;cattering his Church.</Q>

<Q>Even the Synod of <HI>Dort,</HI> by their Pre&s;ident <HI>Bo|german,</HI> expre&s;&s;ed their Approbation of the Church of England, and of Epi&s;copacy, which they were de&s;irous to e&s;tabli&s;h in their Churches, but the Times would not then permit them to make this Change; complaining of their Want of it as a Misfortune:
<Q><HI>Nobis non licet e&s;&s;e tam beatis.</HI></Q>
And <HI>Le Clerc</HI> &s;ays, he profe&s;&s;es his Belief to be, that Epi&s;copacy is of apo&s;tolical In|&s;titution, and that none have a Right to depart from it, unle&s;s in Ca&s;es where the Corruptions of the Church cannot be remedied without it: And that tho&s;e, who live in prote&s;tant Countries where they have Bi&s;hops, as in England, are greatly to blame
<Q>to &s;eparate them&s;elves from them; and more &s;o, if they endeavor to overthrow Epi&s;co|pacy in Order to introduce Pre&s;bytery, Fanati|ci&s;m or Anarchy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Second Letter</HI> to the Author of the CONFESSIONAL.</NOTE>.</Q></Q></P>
<P><HI>GROTIUS,</HI> not only the Glory of Holland, but the Honor of the human Species, a&s;&s;erts, that
<Q>Epi&s;copacy had its Beginning in the apo&s;tolical Times.

But to detract from the Faith of &s;uch Writers, and &s;o agreeable to one another in their A&s;&s;ertions in an hi&s;torical Matter, is the Part only of an irreverend and ob|&s;tinate Mind.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. X.</NOTE>ONE <HI>Section</HI> of the <HI>Appeal</HI> was devoted to the Con&s;ideration of the grand popular Objecti|on again&s;t an American Epi&s;copate, that it would &s;ubject the People of this Country to the Payment of TITHES. To this Section, which was one of the mo&s;t important in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> at|tempts no An&s;wer at all; evading it by &s;aying, p. 191, that <HI>it has no immediate Connection with the pre&s;ent Subject.</HI> But he knows that before the Pub|lication of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> it was <HI>commonly</HI> thought to be mo&s;t clo&s;ely and intimately connected with the Subject, and that it was one of the mo&s;t general Objections again&s;t American Bi&s;hops that was mentioned. When People were a&s;ked their Opi|nion of &s;uch an Appointment, there was not per|haps one in Fifty, of tho&s;e who knew not what Kind of an Epi&s;copate was propo&s;ed, but would an&s;wer, that we &s;hould all in that Ca&s;e be &s;ubject to the Payment of Tithes. This was frequently offered as the <HI>only</HI> Objection, and almo&s;t always as the <HI>fir&s;t</HI>; and there were but very few of the com|mon People that had any other Objections to offer, than this of <HI>Tithes,</HI> and that of <HI>Spiritual Courts.</HI> It was therefore one principal De&s;ign of the <HI>Ap|peal,</HI> to remove the&s;e two Objections; in the Exe|ecution of which I have been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that even the Doctor can find nothing to &s;ay in Sup|port of either of them. We are told now, that
<PB N="245" REF="011203_0255_0F95329B2E1D7F08">
the Affair of Tithes <HI>has no immediate Connection</HI> with the general Subject in Debate. This is unfair and ungenerous. If the Doctor had &s;et out, and proceeded, with as much Candor as is due, I will not &s;ay, from one Chri&s;tian and Clergyman to ano|ther, but, from Man to Man, he would have con|fe&s;&s;ed, that the&s;e two popular Objections had been &s;o intirely confuted in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> that they ought not any more to be mentioned in this Controver&s;y. It would have been no Injury to his Character, or his Cau&s;e, to have made this candid Acknow|ledgment; for in the Ca&s;e of every literary En|gagement, a <HI>decent</HI> Retreat is the next be&s;t Thing to a Victory.</P>
<P>TO &s;trengthen what was &s;aid upon the Subject, and to confirm the Doctor in his pre&s;ent Opinion, I will pre&s;ent him with the full and explicit Decla|ration, of one of the mo&s;t judicious and cele|brated Writers, that ever treated of the Laws of England. In &s;peaking of the Briti&s;h Colonies in America, he &s;ays:
<Q>It hath been held, that if an uninhabited Country be di&s;covered and plant|ed by Engli&s;h Subjects, all the Engli&s;h Laws then in being, which are the Birthright of every Subject, are immediately then in Force. But this mu&s;t be under&s;tood with very many and very great Re&s;trictions. Such Coloni&s;ts carry with them only &s;o much of the Engli&s;h Law, as is applicable to their own Situation and the Condition of an infant Colony; &s;uch, for In|&s;tance, as the general Rules of Inheritance, and of Protection from per&s;onal Injuries. The ar|tificial Refinements and Di&s;tinctions incident to the Property of a great and commercial Peo|ple, (&s;uch e&s;pecially as are inforced by Penal|ties)
<PB N="246" REF="011203_0256_0F95329BEECD4708">
<HI>the Mode of Maintenance for the e&s;tabli&s;hed Clergy, the Juri&s;diction of &s;piritual Courts,</HI> and a Multitude of other Provi&s;ions, are neither nece&s;&s;ary nor convenient for them, and there|fore ARE NOT IN FORCE<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Black&s;tone's <HI>Commentaries on the Laws of England,</HI> Vol. I. p. 107.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>AS none of my Opponents have hitherto thought proper to revive the baffled Objections of Tithes and Spiritual Courts, I &s;hall immediately proceed to the concluding Section.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XI.</HEAD>
<P>THE De&s;ign of the la&s;t Section of the <HI>Ap|peal</HI> was to remove the few remaining Ob|jections and Su&s;picions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. XI.</NOTE> Of which the fir&s;t was, that, in Ca&s;e of an Epi&s;copate, Laws may <HI>hereaf|ter</HI> be made to &s;ubject us to the Payment of Tithes. To this it was an&s;wered, that
<Q>there can be no more Rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive, that new Laws will be made under an Epi&s;copate, to &s;ubject us to this Burthen, than if Bi&s;hops were not to be &s;ent hither. For Tithes are not paid in England to Bi&s;hops, but the Incumbents of Pari&s;hes.</Q>
Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> would be thought to be of a different Opinion, and to be apprehen&s;ive of this Evil; <HI>e|&s;pecially if the Support of mo&s;t of the epi&s;copal Clergy, in many of the Colonies, &s;hould continue to depend on the Charity of Benefactors at Home, as would proba|bly be the Ca&s;e,</HI> p. 192. Thus it &s;eems, the Impo|&s;ition of Tithes for the Support, not of Bi&s;hops, but of the Clergy, is the Evil to be dreaded. But the Clergy will have the &s;ame Need of Support, with, as without, an Epi&s;copate; and if <HI>their</HI> Support is the Object, the Appointment or Non-Appointment of Bi&s;hops, which has no Connecti|on with it, will not have any great Influence upon the Pur&s;uit of it. To &s;uppo&s;e that two or three Bi&s;hops in America will be able to turn the Scale &s;o much in Favor of the Clergy, implies, either that the Ballance is nearly equal without them; or that the&s;e Bi&s;hops will have much more Weight,

than Per&s;ons, &s;o de&s;titute of civil Power, were ever known to have. Were every Member of the Legi&s;lature, both at Home and in the Colonies, firmly and zealou&s;ly attached to the Church; nay, if there were not a Di&s;&s;enter, Papi&s;t or Infidel, within the Briti&s;h Dominions, the Impo&s;ition of <HI>Tithes</HI> upon Americans for the Support of their Clergy, would be an Imagination perfectly wild and chimerical. A large Majority of the King's Sub|jects in England and the Colonies, are at this very Time Epi&s;copalians; but there is no Rea&s;on to be|lieve that in &s;o large a Number there is a &s;ingle Per&s;on that wi&s;hes it; and if they were all Church|men without Exception, it is more that probable that there would not be one Advocate for &s;uch a Mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>without all Doubt, this Law, or &s;ome other le&s;s offen&s;ive in Sound, would take Place here, as &s;oon as the State of Things would allow of it.</HI> I find it much harder to a&s;certain the Meaning of many of his Objections, than to an&s;|wer them, when the Sen&s;e is a&s;certained. If he means in the&s;e Words, that &s;ome other Law, le&s;s offen&s;ive <HI>only</HI> in Sound, but equal in its Effect, with the Impo&s;ition of Tithes, will <HI>without all Doubt</HI> be made for the Support of the Clergy; it is an&s;wered above. And, what are we to under|&s;tand by the Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>as &s;oon as the State of Things will allow of it?</HI> The State of Things which in his Opinion would amount to this, re|quires an Explanation previou&s;ly to an An&s;wer. The Doctor &s;eems here to have &s;hifted the Idea of <HI>Tithes,</HI> or of &s;ome <HI>Equivalent,</HI> for the Support of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> for that of a <HI>Tax</HI> to &s;upport the <HI>Bi&s;hops.</HI> For he immediately ob&s;erves, that I had <HI>incauti|ou&s;ly
<PB N="249" REF="011203_0259_0F95329F52376BF0">
dropt that, which naturally leads to &s;uch a Thought,</HI> viz. A Tax for the Support of American Bi&s;hops. And then I am introduced as an&s;wering the <HI>next Objection,</HI> which is no other than this very Su&s;picion or Apprehen&s;ion. Thus the Reader &s;ees, that by an unexpected Tran&s;ition, whether artful or artle&s;s, I will not determine, we are carried to ano|ther Point.</P>
<P>IN &s;peaking to the Subject of an imaginary <HI>Tax for the Support of American Bi&s;hops,</HI> nothing which I meant or wi&s;hed to conceal, was <HI>incautiou&s;ly dropt.</HI> For in an&s;wering the Objection, I denied that &s;uch a Tax was at all intended or de&s;ired. I moreover &s;hewed that it could not be much wanted&mdash;that it was always propo&s;ed, that the Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;upported without any Expence to this Country&mdash; that a con&s;iderable Fund was already rai&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e&mdash;and, &s;o far as it &s;hould be deficient, that there was no Doubt entertained by the Friends of the propo&s;ed Appointment, of its being ea&s;ily made up by voluntary Donations. But farther to &s;hew that Americans have no Rea&s;on to be terrified on that Account, I con&s;idered the Matter under the mo&s;t unfavourable Suppo&s;ition that could be made; namely, that the Deficiency of the epi&s;copal Fund &s;hould be an&s;wered by a Tax upon the Inhabitants; and declared it as my Opinion, that &s;uch a Tax would be incon&s;iderable, and amount to no more than Four Pence in a Hundred Pounds.
<Q>This, as I went on to ob&s;erve, would be no mighty Hard&s;hip upon the Country. He that could think much of giving the &s;ix thou&s;andth Part of his Income to any U&s;e, which the Legi&s;lature of his Country &s;hould a&s;&s;ign, de&s;erves not to be con&s;idered in the Light of a good Subject, or
<PB N="250" REF="011203_0260_0F95329FADE21FD0">
Member of Society.</Q>
This Ob&s;ervation I &s;till believe to be as true, as any Propo&s;ition in the <HI>Ap|peal,</HI> or in the Doctor's <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of our <HI>weekly</HI> Adver&s;aries &s;martly retorts upon me, in the&s;e Words:
<Q>Would not he think it a Hard&s;hip, and a mighty one too, to be obliged to pay one Farthing in a hundred Pounds, to the Support of any other religious Denomination in the World?</Q>
(<HI>Am. Whig,</HI> Numb. XXI.) I an&s;wer, No, I &s;hould not think it a Hard&s;hip to be obliged to contribute &s;uch a Trifle, for the Support even of Maho|meti&s;m; in Ca&s;e I lived in a Mahometan Country, and were indulged with the free and full Enjoyment of my own Religion, at the &s;ame Time.</NOTE>. But there|upon he apo&s;trophi&s;es and harangues <HI>ad Populum,</HI> in the following rhetorical Strain: <HI>You &s;ee here, ye Coloni&s;ts, the Opinion of the Dr. and, we rea&s;onably pre&s;ume, of the epi&s;copal Clergy under who&s;e Direc|tion he wrote, that the Country might</HI> IN EQUITY, <HI>be taxed for the Support of Bi&s;hops,</HI> p. 193. But I affirm that the Coloni&s;ts &s;ee no &s;uch Thing. Such an Opinion I never expre&s;&s;ed, either cautiou&s;ly or <HI>incautiou&s;ly</HI>; and never once intimated that I thought &s;uch a Tax would be equitable. If he will but re|view the Pa&s;&s;age, he mu&s;t be convinced of this him&s;elf, unle&s;s he is in the Condition of tho&s;e, who "having Eyes, &s;ee not;" and if he will re|view his own Conduct relating to it, perhaps he may be convinced of&mdash;Something el&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Argument he u&s;es to prove, that a good Subject and Member of Society might con&s;i&s;tently refu&s;e to pay the &s;ix thou&s;andth Part of his Income, towards the Support of American Bi&s;hops, in Ca&s;e &s;uch a Tax &s;hould be con&s;titutionally impo&s;ed; by proving too much, unfortunately proves nothing. <HI>If the Country might be taxed Four Pence in a hun|dred Pounds,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>it might for the &s;ame Rea&s;on,
<PB N="251" REF="011203_0261_0F9532A06E444CA0">
and with</HI> AS MUCH <HI>Ju&s;tice, if it was thought the Support of Bi&s;hops called for it, be taxed Four Shil|lings, or Four Pounds in the Hundred, and &s;o on to Ten Pounds, until the Tax of Tythes was compleatly fa&s;tened on us,</HI> p. 194. To &s;ay nothing of the ab|&s;urd Notion, that we may with <HI>as much</HI> Ju&s;tice, or with as little Inju&s;tice, tran&s;gre&s;s the Rules of E|quity greatly and notoriou&s;ly, as in a &s;mall Degree; which is equivalent with this, that a Man that has aberrated 100 Miles from his proper Road, is <HI>not farther</HI> out of his Way, than he that has deviated <HI>one</HI> Mile: The &s;ame Argument will equally con|clude again&s;t every Degree of civil Authority. Thus, for In&s;tance, if a Country may be taxed Four Pence in a hundred Pounds, it may, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, and <HI>with as much Ju&s;tice,</HI> if it was thought that the Support of GOVERNMENT called for it, be taxed Four Shillings, or Four Pounds in the Hundred, and &s;o on to the whole. Again, if a Man's per&s;onal Services may be ju&s;tly claimed by the Public for one Day in the Year, they may <HI>as ju&s;tly</HI> be claimed for a Week, a Month, or even the whole Year. Any Man that &s;hould rea&s;on at this Rate, and act according to the Tenor of &s;uch rea&s;oning, I fancy, would not be e&s;teemed a good Subject or Member of Soci|ety, in any State or Kingdom on the Face of the Globe. And yet, this Kind of rea&s;oning the Doctor teaches!</P>
<P>THE next Subject of his Animadver&s;ion, is the An&s;wer given in the <HI>Appeal</HI> to the Objection or Su&s;picion, that probably the Power of American Bi&s;hops may be hereafter augmented. But what was then &s;aid, I conceive, remains in full Force,
<PB N="252" REF="011203_0262_0F9532A12E0EA640">
notwith&s;tanding the Doctor's Attempts to weaken it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The <HI>American Whig</HI> has given him&s;elf very triumphant Airs, in his Attack upon the Pa&s;&s;age under our pre&s;ent Re|view. "However," as is remarked by one of my Friends,
<Q>he does not offer a Syllable that will invalidate the Infe|rence.

If he has &s;aid any Thing upon the Subject which is worthy of Notice, it has been abundantly an&s;wered, in the different Parts of this Defence, which I need not repeat. Nay, much more that was &s;aid upon the Subject by Dr. Mayhew, who pu&s;hed the Objection to Extremity, has been fully an&s;wered by Mr. Apthorp; and, I may add, was <HI>powerfully</HI> an&s;wered and confuted by him&s;elf, in Words quoted <HI>incautiou&s;ly</HI> by the Doctor, in p. 174.
<Q>It is readily owned, &s;ays Dr. Mayhew, that our Apprehen&s;ion of what may po&s;&s;ibly or probably be the Con&s;equence of Bi&s;hops being &s;ent hither, ought not to put us on infringing the religious Liberty of our Fellow-Subjects, and Chri&s;tian Brethren.</Q></P>
<P>TO &s;hew that Americans need not be frightened with the Imagination that our Bi&s;hops may in Time

be inve&s;ted with civil Authority, I explained in what Manner it would probably operate, on <HI>Sup|po&s;ition</HI> that the Ca&s;e &s;hould actually happen. My Words are the&s;e:
<Q>But &s;hould the Government &s;ee fit hereafter to inve&s;t them with &s;ome Degree of civil Power, worthy of their Acceptance, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay they will not, al|though there is no Appearance that they ever will; yet as no new Powers will be created in Favor of Bi&s;hops, it is inconceivable that any would thereby be injured.</Q>
The Doctor &s;ays, <HI>this has unwarily opened the Workings of</HI> my <HI>own Heart.</HI> And in p. 202, he goes farther and &s;ays, that I <HI>&s;uppo&s;e,</HI> i. e. <HI>believe</HI> (as his U&s;e of the Word nece&s;&s;arily implies) that the American Bi&s;hops will be inve&s;ted with civil Authority; but with what Ju&s;tice, is &s;ubmitted to the Reader. Is &s;uch a Be|lief deducible from my having made the Suppo&s;i|tion? Things confe&s;&s;edly improbable, and even impo&s;&s;ible, are frequently <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> for the U&s;e of Illu&s;tration. Is it infered from my declaring it to be
<Q>impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, that Bi&s;hops will not be in|ve&s;ted with civil Authority?</Q>
I can al&s;o truly de|clare, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay that Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> will not be made an American Bi&s;hop; but it would be unju&s;t to infer from thence, that I <HI>believed</HI> &s;o extraordinary a Thing would happen; e&s;pecially if I &s;hould add, as I did in the other Ca&s;e, that 'there is no Apearance that he ever will.'</P>
<P>IN p. 196, the Doctor turns a&s;ide to &s;hew, that the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, which is not of this World, &s;hould not concern them&s;elves with temporal Matters; and he quotes St. Paul, to &s;up|port his Opinion. But how far he means to carry the Doctrine, whether as far as it was carried by
<PB N="254" REF="011203_0264_0F9532A30DAA69C0">
the <HI>Fratricelli,</HI> or the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Herman Pongilup,</HI> in the 13th Century, he does not &s;ay; but he evi|dently carries it much farther than the venerable Doctors <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> and <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> and Dr. <HI>Cole|man,</HI> who&s;e Opinion we have &s;een. As it is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to enter into a Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this Subject, which has no Relation to that of American Bi|&s;hops, I &s;hall pa&s;s it by; thanking the Doctor for recomending to me good old Bi&s;hop Latimer's <HI>Sermon of the Plough</HI>; and promi&s;ing him to read it carefully, if he will be &s;o kind as to direct me where I can meet with it; if perchance he him&s;elf hath met with any more of it than is quoted by Mr. Peirce.</P>
<P>THE Doctor now, drawing towards a Conclu&s;i|on, looks back upon his Performance, and &s;eems to be mightily &s;atisfied with what he has been do|ing. I fear I have &s;omewhat broken in upon his Repo&s;e; the Apprehen&s;ion of which, I a&s;&s;ure him, gives me no Plea&s;ure. If I could have done Ju&s;|tice to the Cau&s;e I have undertaken to plead, without di&s;turbing him, I would mo&s;t willingly have avoided it. I have a Veneration for his Years, and much Re&s;pect for his Character, which I am &s;orry he has expo&s;ed by engaging in &s;o wretched a Cau&s;e. He has written with Reputation on other Subjects, but he is manife&s;tly unequal to the Diffi|culties he had to encounter with on this. And in|deed, where is the Man that is equal to &s;uch a Ta&s;k? Who is able to prove, that good is evil, and evil good&mdash;that Darkne&s;s is Light, and Light Darkne&s;s&mdash;as well as to <HI>call</HI> them &s;o? Until a Per|&s;on of &s;uch a Genius and Abilities can be found, it never can be proved, that it is not cruel and un|righteous to oppo&s;e our having &s;uch an Epi&s;co|pate,
<PB N="255" REF="011203_0265_0F9532A381BE9050">
as is reque&s;ted for the Church in Ame|rica.</P>
<P>THE Doctor has a few other Things to &s;ay, of which &s;ome Notice mu&s;t be taken. I had in&s;i&s;ted that Rea&s;ons of Policy demanded from our Supe|ors and Governors at Home, peculiar Attention to the Complaints of Epi&s;copalians in the Colonies: Becau&s;e
<Q>the Church of England here is in&s;epara|bly connected with the Church at Home, or ra|ther, is e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame with it</Q>
&mdash;and becau&s;e this Church
<Q>in its external Polity, is &s;o happily con|nected and interwoven with the civil Con&s;tituti|on, that each mutually &s;upports and is &s;upported by the other; no Form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Govern|ment &s;o exactly harmonizing with a <HI>mixed</HI> Mo|narchy, as that of a <HI>qualified</HI> Epi&s;copacy.</Q>
The Doctor an&s;wers, that according to my own Ac|count of Bi&s;hops, they <HI>are ab&s;olute Monarchs in the Church; and &s;uch mu&s;t Kings be in the State to make out a proper Analogy,</HI> p. 198; and much has been offered to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e by one of my weekly Antagoni&s;ts. But to all that they have &s;aid, it is a &s;ufficient Reply, that according to the Repre&s;enta|tion of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> Bi&s;hops are inve&s;ted with an Authority for which they acknowledge them&s;elves to be accountable,&mdash;an Authority limited and re|gulated by fixed Laws, which is incompatible with the Idea of an ab&s;olute Monarch; who knows no other Law than his own arbitrary Plea&s;ure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spirit of Laws, Book II.</NOTE>. The true Parallel between eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil Go|vernment, as I concieve, runs thus: <HI>Independency</HI> an&s;wers to <HI>Democracy&mdash;Pre&s;byteriani&s;m,</HI> to an <HI>Ari&s;|tocracy</HI>&mdash;primitive, or prote&s;tant <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> to a <HI>mixed Monarchy</HI>&mdash;and <HI>Popery,</HI> to an <HI>ab&s;olute Mo|narchy.</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="011203_0266_0F9532A441EA8250">
From hence it follows, that in the View of <HI>meer Policy,</HI> it is ab&s;urd to encourage epi&s;copal Go|vernment in Republicks and democratical States; and as much &s;o, to prefer Pre&s;byteriani&s;m or Inde|pendency, where the civil Government is regal, or monarchical.</P>
<P>THE Doctor is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, p. 199, in the true Spirit of Contradiction, what I believe has never been &s;aid by any before him, that <HI>the Go|vernment of the Church,</HI> by &s;uch Bi&s;hops as I had de&s;cribed, <HI>is</HI> MORE UNLIKE <HI>the Government of the State, by Kings, Lords, and Commons, than any Form of Government of the Church that was ever known in the Colonies; and perhaps, is</HI> MORE <HI>naturally and powerfully adapted to</HI> SUBVERT <HI>it.</HI> But whither will the&s;e extraordinary Flights at la&s;t carry him? He forgets that he &s;et out upon the contrary Prin|ciple, in the Beginning of his Book; &s;toutly con|tending that Epi&s;copacy was e&s;tabli&s;hed at the Time of the Reformation, not upon the Footing of a divine In&s;titution, but upon Account of its being be&s;t fitted to the Form of Government in the State. The civil Con&s;titution of the Briti&s;h Mo|narchy is, in all e&s;&s;ential Points, the &s;ame now that it was at that Period, and Epi&s;copacy is the &s;ame; &s;o that if they were peculiarly adapted to each other then, they are now. That this was, and is, the Ca&s;e, I fully believe; and Rea&s;ons for this Belief were given in the <HI>Appeal</HI>; which Rea|&s;ons the Doctor has not attempted to invalidate.</P>
<P>IT is well known that the &s;ame Opinion has been maintained, by the greate&s;t and be&s;t Writers upon the Subject.

<Q>for my Part, not prejudging the Proceedings of other Churches, I do hold it to be warranted by the Word of God, and by the Practice of the ancient Church in better Times, and <HI>much more convenient for</HI> KINGDOMS, than a Parity of Mi|ni&s;ters, and Government by Synods.</Q>
It was an Ob&s;ervation of the noble and learned <HI>Philip de Mornay,</HI> who was not only a Calvini&s;t, but a principal Support of the Prote&s;tant Religion in France;
<Q>that although the pre&s;byterian Govern|ment might do well enough in popular States, &s;uch as Geneva and Switzerland, yet in King|doms or Monarchies, epi&s;copal Government is rather to be cho&s;en.</Q>
<Q>And the &s;ame Opinion in much &s;tronger Terms, and <HI>with a particular View to England,</HI> was profe&s;&s;ed by another Fo|reigner, who under&s;tood Politicks as well as mo&s;t Men of his Time, and was both a good Pro|te&s;tant and had great Candor in Matters of Re|ligion; I mean the celebrated <HI>Pa&s;&s;endorf,</HI> who expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the following Words:
<Q>In this Re&s;pect likewi&s;e not a little Blemi&s;h is thought to lie upon many of the Calvini&s;ts, as being too much inclined to affect Democracies, and being on the contrary aver&s;e to Monarchies, and forward to <HI>&s;ubvert</HI> them.</Q></Q>
<Q>When <HI>Puffen|dorf</HI> &s;ays that the Calvini&s;ts are too much inclined to Democracies, he is not to be under&s;tood as if he repre&s;ented all of that Sect as being at all Times thus di&s;po&s;ed; for no doubt, while the Kings under whom they live encourage and favor them, they may &s;o long be well enough plea&s;ed with their Government, and willing to &s;upport it. The Baron's Meaning I take to have been,
<PB N="258" REF="011203_0268_0F9532A81084C280">
that the popular Forms of their Church-Govern|ment, have a natural Tendency to rai&s;e Di&s;po&s;i|tions, which, when either they are &s;oured by un|favorable Treatment, or not enough &s;weetned by per&s;onal Intere&s;t under Monarchies, are apt to lean much towards popular Schemes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elyls <HI>Tracts,</HI> p. 148.</NOTE>.</Q>
I might quote innumerable Authorities to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; but I will content my&s;elf with one more.
<Q>The e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion, and the e&s;tabli&s;hed Go|vernment,</Q>
&s;ays a Writer of great Candor and Penetration,
<Q>are in their Con&s;titution and Inter|e&s;ts &s;o interwoven and linked together, that they who would <HI>&s;ubvert</HI> the Government, have no &s;urer Way to compa&s;s their wicked Ends, than by endeavouring to ruin the Church fir&s;t. The greate&s;t Strength of the Government ever did and ever will lie in the Fidelity and Affection of the Members of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church: As the Government knows this to be true, <HI>&s;o do its Enemies,</HI> who therefore are as ready by all Ar|tifices and Attempts to weaken it, as our Go|vernors can be to favor and protect it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hare's Works, Vol. I. p. 332.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><HI>WE are neither &s;o void of Di&s;cernment,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>or unacquainted with the Intrigues of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t zealous for an American Epi&s;copate, as not to be fully &s;atisfied, they have much more in De|&s;ign than they have been plea&s;ed openly to declare,</HI> p. 201. But notwith&s;tanding his Opinion of his own <HI>Di&s;cernment,</HI> he &s;hould remember that this Charge brought again&s;t us before
<Q>the Tribunal of the Public,</Q>
ought to be &s;upported, at lea&s;t, with an <HI>Appearance</HI> of Evidence. It is no &s;mall Thing pub|lickly to accu&s;e of Prevarication and Fal&s;hood,
<PB N="259" REF="011203_0269_0F9532A8C3F14AE8">
&s;uch a Number of Men, who have always been re&s;pected for their Integrity; and &s;omething more than arbitrary Su&s;picions will be needful, to ju&s;tify &s;o high an Impeachment. But he tells us, he is <HI>not unacquainted with their Intrigues.</HI> Let him then, for the Sake of his own Reputation, di&s;cover them to the World. This is what he owes both to the Public and him&s;elf; and it is expected from him, as he would not betray the Cau&s;e, for which he profe&s;&s;es to be uncommonly zealous. Let him mention &s;ome one <HI>Intrigue,</HI> &s;ome over-Act, from which it can rea&s;onably be concluded, that our De&s;igns are contrary to our Declarations, and we will take Shame to our&s;elves; but if he can offer no other Proof than his pretended <HI>Di&s;cernment</HI> of our &s;ecret Intentions, he will be con&s;idered as no better than a fal&s;e Accu&s;er of his Chri&s;tian Bre|thren, who have given him no ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Pro|vocation. This Matter is of &s;o great Con&s;equence in the pre&s;ent Debate, that we cannot give it up, but mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t that he comes to a particular Expla|nation. Much, very much, depends upon it. The Uproar about Bi&s;hops has been, in a great Mea|&s;ure, excited and continued by this very Pretence. If we are guilty of what he charges us with, we de&s;erve to be oppo&s;ed; if we are innocent, we ought to be acquitted. I therefore call upon him in a pub|lic Manner to produce his Evidence, or to retract his Charge.</P>
<P><HI>THEIR ultimate Views,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>whatever they propo&s;e to begin with, have not been &s;o perfectly &s;e|creted in their own Brea&s;ts, but that they have been whi&s;pered about from one Friend to another, &s;o that we are at no Lo&s;s to form a true Judgment of them.</HI> And again: <HI>Things have tran&s;pired from tho&s;e, who
<PB N="260" REF="011203_0270_0F9532AB06B6C3E8">
did not know how, or were not able to keep a Secret,</HI> p. 202. I once more affirm, that we have no other Views than what we have publi&s;hed; and I defy any of our Adver&s;aries to prove the contrary. I can, at lea&s;t, an&s;wer for my&s;elf; I can an&s;wer al&s;o for our Convention, with who&s;e Views and Inten|tions it will be allowed that I am acquainted&mdash; that we have no <HI>Secret</HI> in the Ca&s;e; that we have no <HI>ultimate Views</HI> that are contrary to our <HI>immediate</HI> ones; and that the&s;e are not contrary to our pub|lic Declarations. But to an&s;wer to &s;uch an inde|finite Charge of <HI>private Whi&s;pers,</HI> by no Body knows <HI>whom</HI> or <HI>when,</HI> about no Body knows <HI>what</HI>; is more than I will undertake, as I am con&s;cious of my Want of the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Di&s;cernment.</HI> And if the Doctor has no other Evidence, it is meer trifling with the Attention of the Public, to in&s;i&s;t upon this. It concerns him to &s;hew that &s;ome Di&s;covery has been made, either with or without De&s;ign, by &s;ome Per&s;on who may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be acquainted with all <HI>Secrets</HI> of the Kind, that the Clergy have been acting a deceitful, double Part with the World, and are aiming at a different Epi&s;copate from that of the <HI>Appeal.</HI> This is the grand Point; and upon his Proof of it, I will venture to ri&s;que the whole Controver&s;y.</P>
<P>I HAVE now done with Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> for the pre|&s;ent, having replied to every Thing material in his Performance, whether it relates immediately to the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate, to the Church of England, or to the <HI>Appeal</HI>; excepting what he has &s;aid upon the general Subject of Epi&s;copacy:&mdash;And even to &s;ome Things that are not material, any farther than as they are thought &s;o by &s;ome ignorant, pre|judiced Per&s;ons. I have pa&s;&s;ed over nothing, from
<PB N="261" REF="011203_0271_0F9532ABE1F7C148">
any Opinion of Difficulty in replying to it; and I have endeavored to obviate all the Objections of o|thers, in an&s;wering the Doctor's. Different Lan|guage from his has been frequently u&s;ed in the late periodical Exhibitions again&s;t the Church; but the Objections have been much the &s;ame; and I am mi&s;taken, if I have not done Ju&s;tice to the Ar|guments and Repre&s;entations of tho&s;e Writers, as well as to his.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed one Objection &s;tarted by them, which has not yet been con&s;idered; and I hardly know, whether it is worth con&s;idering. The Ob|jection is, that &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as is propo&s;ed for the Colonies, is an <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> Thing in its own Nature. <HI>The Impo&s;&s;ibility of the Thing</HI> is repre&s;en|ted by one Writer, to be &s;o glaringly evident, that it is <HI>utterly incredible that they</HI> (the Clergy) <HI>&s;hould be &s;o exce&s;&s;ively ignorant, as not to know it</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>American Whig,</HI> Numb. IV.</NOTE>. It is a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to this Objection, &s;uppo&s;ing it to have been made &s;eriou&s;ly, that tho&s;e eminent Per|&s;ons who fir&s;t projected the Plan, and tho&s;e who have from Time to Time been its Patrons&mdash;many of whom were much better acquainted with the Con&s;titution of the Kingdom and its Colonies than the&s;e Objectors&mdash;could &s;ee no Impo&s;&s;ibility or Dif|ficulty in the Matter. Nay, as to <HI>the Impo&s;&s;ibility of the Thing,</HI> Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> him&s;elf, who, in the <HI>Ame|rican Whig</HI>'s Opinion, is <HI>one of the mo&s;t learned and able Writers in America</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Numb. LII.</NOTE>&punc; was, about a Year ago, <HI>&s;o exce&s;&s;ive ignorant as not to know it.</HI> For it is <HI>ut|terly incredible,</HI> that, if he had known or &s;u&s;pected the <HI>Impo&s;&s;ibility</HI> that &s;uch a Plan could be executed, he would not have availed him&s;elf of &s;o capital an
<PB N="262" REF="011203_0272_0F9532AC6E5914F0">
Objection. To this may be added: It is a good Evidence that the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copote <HI>may</HI> exi&s;t in America, that &s;uch an Epi&s;copate <HI>has</HI> actually exi&s;t|ed, and <HI>does</HI> now exi&s;t, in America, among the Moravians; and if it may in one Church, why not in another? It has been &s;aid that the Church of England is an Exception, becau&s;e its Bi&s;hops by <HI>the Law of the Land,</HI> are intitled to certain Powers and Preheminences wherever they are &s;ettled in the Briti&s;h Dominions; which Powers are di&s;claimed in the Plan. <HI>The Law of the Land</HI> in this Objecti|on, I &s;uppo&s;e, means the Laws of England, and not any Laws peculiar to this Country; and if by the Laws of England Bi&s;hops, contrary to the clear Opinion of Dr. Black&s;tone, will be inve&s;ted with &s;uch Powers and Preheminences in America, as &s;oon as they &s;hall be &s;ent hither; it mu&s;t be owing to this only Rea&s;on&mdash;that the Laws of Eng|land e&s;tabli&s;h the Church throughout the Briti&s;h American Colonies, in the &s;ame Manner that it is e&s;tabli&s;hed in England. But will the Objectors ad|mit of this Doctrine? Have not the able&s;t Writers of their Party, always in&s;i&s;ted upon the contrary? Does not this Doctrine nece&s;&s;arily imply, that we have, be&s;ides an equitable, a <HI>legal,</HI> Right to an Epi&s;copate; and that our Oppo&s;ers tran&s;gre&s;s the <HI>Law of the Land,</HI> as well as the Laws of Equity? But &s;till, an E&s;tabli&s;hment in Favor of the Church here, which they in&s;inuate in this Controver&s;y that we have, but which they mean not to allow on any other Occa&s;ion, would by no Means exclude an Epi&s;copate in the very Form that is &s;pecified; for &s;uch an Epi&s;copate, I believe, may, at any Time, be erected, or rather, re&s;tored, in England. It was &s;hewn in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> that the Bi&s;hops pro|po&s;ed for America, were fir&s;t mentioned by the
<PB N="263" REF="011203_0273_0F9532AD2F002678">
Title of <HI>Suffragans</HI>; and tho&s;e who are acquainted with the Hi&s;tory of the Church, and the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Laws of England, know, that the Bi&s;hops marked out in our Plan, whatever they may be called, are in Reality no other than Suffragans. If therefore the Laws of England admit of Suffra|gans, which they as certainly do, as of Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops, they then admit of &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as we contend for; even were we to &s;uppo&s;e the Church of England to be as fully e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Colonies as it is in England, and by the &s;ame Laws. Suffragans have been frequently appointed at Home, under the pre&s;ent eccle&s;ia&s;tical E&s;tabli&s;h|ment; and the Con&s;equence is unavoidable, that they may be appointed here. But after all, were the Ca&s;e in every Re&s;pect as the Objection repre|&s;ents it to be, which it is not in any Re&s;pect; yet an Act of Parliament would make our Plan prac|ticable; and there can be no Doubt but its Friends have Intere&s;t enough to obtain &s;uch an Act, &s;hould they find it to be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>CONCLUSION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Reader is now acquainted with both Sides of this Controver&s;y. An Epi&s;copate is reque&s;ted, in Behalf of the Church of England in America. The Rea&s;ons for which it is de&s;ired, have been offered in the <HI>Appeal.</HI> The Nature of the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate, has al&s;o been explained. Di&s;&s;atisfied Per&s;ons were candidly invited to pro|po&s;e their Objections. The Adver&s;aries of the Church have had Time to object; and a &s;ufficient Number of Per&s;ons has been employed in this Service. The periodical Objectors have had peri|odical An&s;wers; and a Reply is now given to the more formal Objections of Dr. <HI>Chauncy.</HI></P>
<P>THAT Objections would ari&s;e again&s;t the Settle|ment of Bi&s;hops in the Colonies, unle&s;s they &s;hould be under peculiar Regulations, was originally fore|&s;een; and therefore, in forming the Plan for an American Epi&s;opate, all po&s;&s;ible Care was taken to render it inoffen&s;ive. It is e&s;&s;ential to this Plan, that the Bi&s;hops intended, are to have no Support from the Colonies, except by voluntary Donations from private Per&s;ons; and that they are to exerci&s;e no Juri&s;diction, but over the Clergy of the Church of England; by which Provi&s;ion, the great popular Objections of <HI>Tithes,</HI> and <HI>Spiritual Courts,</HI> have no Foundation to re&s;t on. This is &s;o evident, that our Opponents have hazarded but very little upon tho&s;e Points; and have found it nece&s;&s;ary to introduce a new Set of Objections, in Order to keep up the Oppo&s;ition again&s;t the Church, being unable to defend the old ones.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="011203_0275_0F9532AEB8B476D8">THEY now object that we do not really de&s;ire to have an Epi&s;copate under &s;uch a Modification, as is propo&s;ed to the Public. This is a very material Objection, could it be &s;upported; and de&s;erves perhaps more Attention, than all the others which they are able to offer. But important as it is, it has nothing more &s;olid to depend upon than malevolent Conjecture; for whatever may be their Pretences, every Reader knows that they have hitherto in|tirely failed in the Article of <HI>Proof.</HI> On our Side, the &s;tronge&s;t Evidence that the Nature of &s;uch a Ca&s;e will admit of, has been laid before the Public. We have produced as Witne&s;&s;es the Society's an|niver&s;ary Sermons, their Ab&s;tracts, and indeed all that has peen publi&s;hed on the Subject by &s;uch as could be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand the Ca&s;e, for Half a Century pa&s;t; all which, without one Ex|ception, te&s;tify in our Favor. We have added our &s;olemn Declarations, which mu&s;t have a Weight proportionable to what is allowed to our Characters. The Te&s;timony of our Vouchers is clear and ex|pre&s;s, uniform and con&s;i&s;tent, and directly to the Point; while not one counter Evidence has appear|ed on the other Side to weaken it. To the Weight of our Declarations nothing has been oppo&s;ed, but ungenerous Reflections and pretended Su&s;picions.</P>
<P>AETER driving the preceding Objection as far as po&s;&s;ible, it has been farther urged, that &s;uppo|&s;ing &s;uch an harmle&s;s Epi&s;copate as that of the <HI>Appeal</HI> to be at fir&s;t &s;ettled, yet it would &s;oon de|generate into one that is oppre&s;&s;ive. We &s;ee not the lea&s;t Probability of this&punc; and we ab&s;olutely deny that any &s;uch Thing is intended: So far from it, that the Friends of the Church would even join ++with its Enemies, were that nece&s;&s;ary, in guarding a|gain&s;t
<PB N="266" REF="011203_0276_0F9532AF6DFD6830">
it. All the A&s;&s;urances, all the Evidences, all the Securities which we have in our Power to give, to prevent Unea&s;ine&s;s, we are willing to of|fer; and all that is not beneath the Dignity of Go|vernment to give, we are willing to &s;ollicit. We want not an Epi&s;copate on the Footing of a <HI>State-E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI>; we de&s;ire no more than a compleat Toleration, which we have not at pre&s;ent; and thereby to be rai&s;ed to an Equality with other re|ligious Denominations in the Colonies. To this, we think our&s;elves intitled, upon the common Principles of religious Liberty and of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution; and we are &s;urprized and concerned, to find that any who profe&s;s a Regard for tho&s;e Principles, can oppo&s;e our Claim. We are &s;till more &s;urprized to &s;ee the Arts to which they can de&s;cend, in &s;upporting their Oppo&s;ition. From Men of Sen&s;e and Candor, rea&s;onable and candid Beha|viour is naturally expected. From Gentlemen we expect, at lea&s;t, Decency; and from Chri&s;tians, Charity. Our Opponents make high Preten&s;ions to Candor and good Sen&s;e, and call them&s;elves Gentlemen and Chri&s;tians; but how far their late Attacks upon the Church have been rea&s;onable, or candid, or decent, or charitable, I am perhaps too far intere&s;ted, fairly to determine. The <HI>Public</HI> have been invited to judge of this Controver&s;y; and to their impartial Deci&s;ion the Manner, as well as the Matter of it, is mo&s;t re&s;pectfully &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>IF this Di&s;pute is to be continued, I would humbly propo&s;e a <HI>new</HI> Plan of Operations, viz. That the Debate be reduced within a narrower Compa&s;s, and that nothing which does not imme|diately relate to the Merits of the Cau&s;e, be offer|ed on either Side. We have already tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed too
<PB N="267" REF="011203_0277_0F9532B02F7B1EF0">
far upon the Patience of the Public; let us be careful hereafter to make a proper U&s;e of their Indulgence. I would al&s;o propo&s;e, that no Invec|tive or Abu&s;e, nothing that &s;avors of Bigotry or Barbarity, be &s;uffered to mingle in the Debate; but that ingenuous, &s;ober Rea&s;oning, &s;hould decide it. It ought to be remembered, that we are not only accountable to the Public for our Behavior in this Controver&s;y, but that we mu&s;t one Day an&s;wer for it before a higher Tribunal.</P>
<P>THIS la&s;t Con&s;ideration had &s;uch an Effect upon Dr. du Moulin, who, it &s;eems, had been an <HI>abu&s;ive</HI> controver&s;ial Writer, that when he came to lie upon his Death-Bed, he made the following penitential Declaration; which may de&s;erve our peculiar At|tention, while we are engaged in the pre&s;ent Di&s;|pute about American Bi&s;hops.
<Q>As for my Books, &s;ays he, in which I mixed many per&s;onal Reflec|tions, I am now &s;en&s;ible I vented too much of my own Pa&s;&s;ion and Bitterne&s;s; and therefore I di&s;claim all that is per&s;onal in them; and am heartily &s;orry for every Thing I have written to the <HI>defaming</HI> any Per&s;on. I humbly beg God, and all tho&s;e I have wronged, Pardon, for Je&s;us Chri&s;t's Sake, and am re&s;olved, if God &s;pare my Life, never to meddle more with &s;uch per&s;onal Things: And do earne&s;tly exhort all People, as a dying Man, that they will &s;tudy more Love and mutual Forbearance in their Differences; and will avoid all bitter and uncharitable Reflec|tions on one another's Per&s;ons. And as I ear|ne&s;tly pray tho&s;e worthy Men of the Church of England to have Charity and Tenderne&s;s for the Di&s;&s;enters from them; &s;o I beg of the Di&s;|&s;enters that they would have a due Regard and

Re&s;pect to tho&s;e of the Church of England: Of many of whom I &s;ay now, let my Soul be with theirs! And that all true Prote&s;tants among us may heartily unite and concur in the Defence and Pre&s;ervation of the holy reformed Religion, now by the Mercy of God &s;ettled among us. And that Men of all Sides may, according to St. Paul's Rule, cea&s;e to <HI>bite and devour one another, le&s;t</HI> we <HI>be de&s;troyed one of another</HI>; and that whereunto we have already attained, we may walk by the &s;ame Rule; hoping that if any Man is otherwi&s;e minded, in &s;ome le&s;&s;er Things, God &s;hall either reveal that to them, or merciful|ly forgive it, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
