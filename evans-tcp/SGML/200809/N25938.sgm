<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MOST of the following E&s;&s;ays were publi&s;hed in the Mu&s;eum, and Columbi|an Magazine, in this City, &s;oon after the end of the revolutionary war in the United States. A few of them made their fir&s;t appearance in pamphlets. They are now publi&s;hed in a &s;ingle volume, at the reque&s;t of &s;everal friends, and with a view of promoting the ends at fir&s;t con|templated by them. Two of the E&s;&s;ays, viz: that upon the u&s;e of Tobacco, and the account of remarkable circum&s;tances in the con&s;titution and life of Ann Woods, are now &s;ubmitted for the fir&s;t time to the eye of the public. The author has omitted in this collection two pamphlets which he publi&s;hed in the year 1772, upon the &s;lave|ry of the Negroes, becau&s;e he conceived the object of them had been in part accom|pli&s;hed,
<PB REF="034495_0004_0FFE008A44D5B390">
and becau&s;e the Citizens of the United States have &s;ince that time been fur|ni&s;hed from Great Britain and other coun|tries, with numerous tracts upon that &s;ub|ject, more calculated to complete the effect intended by the author, than his early pub|lications.</P>

<HEAD>A PLAN FOR ESTABLISHING PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN PENNSYLVANIA, AND FOR CONDUCTING EDUCA|TION AGREEABLY TO A REPUBLICAN FORM OF GO|VERNMENT. ADDRESSED TO THE LEGISLATURE AND CITIZENS OF PENNSYLVANIA, IN THE YEAR 1786.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to the &s;ubject of this e&s;|&s;ay, I &s;hall point out, in a few words, the influence and advantages of learning upon mankind.</P>
<P N="1">I. It is friendly to religion, ina&s;much as it a&s;&s;i&s;ts in removing prejudice, &s;uper&s;tition and enthu&s;ia&s;m, in promoting ju&s;t notions of the Deity, and in enlarging our knowledge of his works.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is favourable to liberty. Freedom can exi&s;t only in the &s;ociety of knowledge. Without learning, men are incapable of knowing their rights, and where learning is confined to a few people, liberty can be neither equal nor univer&s;al.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="2" REF="034495_0008_0FFE0096A4898400">III. It promotes ju&s;t ideas of laws and govern|ment. "When the clouds of ignorance are di&s;|pelled (&s;ays the Marquis of Beccaria) by the radiance of knowledge, power trembles, but the authority of laws remains immoveable."</P>
<P N="4">IV. It is friendly to manners. Learning in all countries, promotes civilization, and the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="5">V. It promotes agriculture, the great ba&s;is of na|tional wealth and happine&s;s. Agriculture is as much a &s;cience as hydraulics, or optics, and has been equally indebted to the experiments and re&s;earches of learned men. The highly cultivated &s;tate, and the immen&s;e profits of the farms in England, are derived wholly from the patronage which agriculture has received in that country, from learned men and learned &s;ocieties.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Manufactures of all kinds owe their perfection chiefly to learning&mdash;hence the nations of Europe advance in manufactures, knowledge, and com|merce, only in proportion as they cultivate the arts and &s;ciences.</P>
<P>For the purpo&s;e of diffu&s;ing knowledge through every part of the &s;tate, I beg leave to propo&s;e the following &s;imple plan.</P>
<P N="1">I. Let there be one univer&s;ity in the &s;tate, and let this be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the capital. Let law, phy&s;ic, divinity, the law of nature and nations, oeconomy, &amp;c. be taught in it by public lectures in the winter &s;ea&s;on,
<PB N="3" REF="034495_0009_0FFE00982E0069B8">
after the manner of the European univer&s;ities, and let the profe&s;&s;ors receive &s;uch &s;alaries from the &s;tate as will enable them to deliver their lectures at a moderate price.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let there be four colleges. One in Philadelphia; one at Carli&s;le; a third, for the benefit of our German fellow citizens, at Lanca&s;ter; and a fourth, &s;ome years hence at Pitt&s;burg. In the&s;e colleges, let young men be in&s;tructed in mathematics and in the higher branches of &s;cience, in the &s;ame manner that they are now taught in our American colleges. After they have received a te&s;timonial from one of the&s;e colleges, let them, if they can afford it, complete their &s;tudies by &s;pending a &s;ea&s;on or two in attending the lectures in the univer&s;ity. I prefer four colleges in the &s;tate to one or two, for there is a certain &s;ize of colleges as there is of towns and armies, that is mo&s;t favourable to morals and good government. Oxford and Cam|bridge in England are the &s;eats of di&s;&s;ipation, while the more numerous, and le&s;s crouded univer&s;ities and colleges in Scotland, are remarkable for the order, diligence, and decent behaviour of their &s;tudents.</P>
<P N="3">III. Let there be free &s;chools e&s;tabli&s;hed in every town&s;hip, or in di&s;tricts con&s;i&s;ting of one hundred families. In the&s;e &s;chools let children be taught to read and write the Engli&s;h and German languages, and the u&s;e of figures. Such of them as have parents that can afford to &s;end them from home, and are di&s;po&s;ed to extend their educations, may remove their children from the free &s;chool to one of the colleges.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="034495_0010_0FFE0099E08B5838">By this plan the whole &s;tate will be tied together by one &s;y&s;tem of education. The univer&s;ity will in time furni&s;h ma&s;ters for the colleges, and the colleges will furni&s;h ma&s;ters for the free &s;chools, while the free &s;chools, in their turns, will &s;upply the colleges and the univer&s;ity with &s;cholars, &s;tudents and pupils. The &s;ame &s;y&s;tems of grammar, oratory and philo&s;ophy, will be taught in every part of the &s;tate, and the literary features of Penn&s;ylvania will thus de&s;ig|nate one great, and equally enlightened family.</P>
<P>But, how &s;hall we bear the expen&s;e of the&s;e literary in&s;titutions?&mdash;I an&s;wer&mdash;The&s;e in&s;titutions will <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> our taxes. They will enlighten us in the great bu&s;ine&s;s of finance&mdash;they will teach us to en|crea&s;e the ability of the &s;tate to &s;upport government, by encrea&s;ing the profits of agriculture, and by pro|moting manufactures. They will teach us all the modern improvements and advantages of inland navi|gation. They will defend us from ha&s;ty and expen&s;ive experiment in government, by unfolding to us the experience and folly of pa&s;t ages, and thus, in&s;tead of adding to our taxes and debts, they will furni&s;h us with the true &s;ecret of le&s;&s;ening and di&s;charging both of them.</P>
<P>But, &s;hall the e&s;tates of orphans, batchelors and per&s;ons who have no children, be taxed to pay for the &s;upport of &s;chools from which they can derive no benefit ? I an&s;wer in the affirmative, to the fir&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="034495_0011_0FFE009CA1220A58">
part of the objection, and I deny the truth of the latter part of it. Every member of the community is intere&s;ted in the propagation of virtue and knowledge in the &s;tate. But I will go further, and add, it will be true oeconomy in individuals to &s;upport public &s;chools. The batchelor will in time &s;ave his tax for this purpo&s;e, by being able to &s;leep with fewer bolts and locks to his doors&mdash;the e&s;tates of orphans will in time be benefited, by being protected from the ravages of unprincipled and idle boys, and the children of wealthy parents will be le&s;s tempted, by bad company, to extravagance. Fewer pillories and whipping po&s;ts, and &s;maller goals, with their u&s;ual expen&s;es and taxes, will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary when our youth are properly educated, than at pre&s;ent; I believe it could be proved, that the expenes of confining, trying and executing criminals, amount every year, in mo&s;t of the counties, to more money than would be &s;ufficient to maintain all the &s;chools that would be nece&s;&s;ary in each county. The confe&s;&s;ions of the&s;e criminals generally &s;how us, that their vices and puni&s;hments are the fatal con&s;e|quences of the want of a proper education in early life.</P>
<P>I &s;ubmit the&s;e detached hints to the con&s;ideration of the legi&s;lature and of the citizens of Pen&s;ylvania. The plan for the free &s;chools is taken chiefly from the plans which have long been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in
<PB N="6" REF="034495_0012_0FFE00A1E5699B30">
Scotland, and in the ea&s;tern &s;tates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are 600 of the&s;e &s;chools in the &s;mall &s;tate of Connecticut, which at this time have in them 25,000 &s;cholars.</NOTE> of America, where the influence of learning, in promoting religion, morals, manners, and good government, has never been exceeded in any country.</P>
<P>The manner in which the&s;e &s;chools &s;hould be &s;up|ported and governed&mdash;the modes of determining the characters and qualifications of &s;choolma&s;ters, and the arrangement of families in each di&s;trict, &s;o that children of the &s;ame religious &s;ect and nation, may be educa- as much as po&s;&s;ible together, will form a proper part of a law for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;chools, and there|fore does not come within the limits of this plan.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>OF THE MODE OF EDUCATION PROPER IN A REPUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE bu&s;ine&s;s of education has acquired a new complexion by the independence of our country. The form of government we have a&s;&s;umed, has created a new cla&s;s of duties to every American. It becomes us, therefore, to examine our former habits upon this &s;ubject, and in laying the
<PB N="7" REF="034495_0013_0FFE00A36E1F8A78">
foundations for nur&s;eries of wi&s;e and good men, to adapt our modes of teaching to the peculiar form of our government.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t remark that I &s;hall make upon this &s;ubject is, that an education in our own, is to be preferred to an education in a foreign country. The principle of patrioti&s;m &s;tands in need of the reinforcement of prejudice. and it is well known that our &s;tronge&s;t prejudices in favour of our country are formed in the fir&s;t one and twenty years of our lives. The policy of the Lacedemonians is well worthy of our imitation. When Antipater demanded fifty of their children as ho&s;tages for the fulfillment of a di&s;tant engagement, tho&s;e wi&s;e republicans refu&s;ed to comply with his de|mand, but readily offered him double the number of their adult citizens, who&s;e habits and prejudices could not be &s;haken by re&s;iding in a foreign country. Pa&s;&s;ing by, in this place, the advantages to the community from the early attachment of youth to the laws and con&s;titution of their country, I &s;hall only remark, that young men who have trodden the paths of &s;cience together, or have joined in the &s;ame &s;ports, whether of &s;wimming, &s;cating, fi&s;hing, or hunting, generally feel, thro' life, &s;uch ties to each other, as add greatly to the obligations of mutual benevolence.</P>
<P>I conceive the education of our youth in this country to be peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary in Penn&s;ylvania, while our citizens are compo&s;ed of the natives of &s;o many diffe|rent kingdoms in Europe. Our &s;chools of learning,
<PB N="8" REF="034495_0014_0FFE00A4F8478050">
by producing one general, and uniform &s;y&s;tem of education, will render the ma&s;s of the people more homogeneous, and thereby fit them more ea&s;ily for uniform and peaceable government.</P>
<P>I proceed in the next place, to enquire, what mode of education we &s;hall adopt &s;o as to &s;ecure to the &s;tate all the advantages that are to be derived from the proper in&s;truction of youth; and here I beg leave to remark, that the only foundation for a u&s;eful education in a republic is to be laid in Religion. Without this there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty, and liberty is the object and life of all republican governments.</P>
<P>Such is my veneration for every religion that reveals the attributes of the Deity, or a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, that I had rather &s;ee the opinions of Confucius or Mahomed inculcated upon our youth, than &s;ee them grow up wholly devoid of a &s;y&s;tem of religious principles. But the religion I mean to recommend is this place, is that of the New Te&s;ta|ment.</P>
<P>It is foreign to my purpo&s;e to hint at the arguments which e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of the Chri&s;tian revelation. My only bu&s;ine&s;s is to declare, that all its doctrines and precepts are calculated to promote the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, and the &s;afety and well being of civil govern|ment. A Chri&s;tian cannot fail of being a republican. The hi&s;tory of the creation of man, and of the relation
<PB N="9" REF="034495_0015_0FFE00A7C1C1E7C8">
of our &s;pecies to each other by birth, which is recorded in the Old Te&s;tament, is the be&s;t refutation that can be given to the divine right of kings, and the &s;tronge&s;t argument that can be u&s;ed in favor of the original and natural equality of all mankind. A Chri&s;tian, I &s;ay again, cannot fail of being a republican, for every precept of the Go&s;pel inculcates tho&s;e degrees of hu|mility, &s;elf-denial, and brotherly kindne&s;s, which are directly oppo&s;ed to the pride of monarchy and the pageantry of a court. A Chri&s;tian cannot fail of being u&s;eful to the republic, for his religion teacheth him, that no man "liveth to him&s;elf." And la&s;tly, a Chri&s;tian cannot fail of being wholly inoffen&s;ive, for his religion teacheth him, in all things to do to others what he would wi&s;h, in like circum&s;tances, they &s;hould do to him.</P>
<P>I am aware that I di&s;&s;ent from one of tho&s;e paradox|ical opinions with which modern times abound; and that it is improper to fill the minds of youth with religious prejudices of any kind, and that they &s;hould be left to choo&s;e their own principles, after they have arrived at an age in which they are capable of judging for them&s;elves. Could we pre&s;erve the mind in childhood and youth a perfect blank, this plan of education would have more to recommend it; but this we know to be impo&s;&s;ible. The human mind runs as naturally into principles as it does after facts. It &s;ubmits with difficulty to tho&s;e re&s;traints or partial
<PB N="10" REF="034495_0016_0FFE00AD0A917990">
di&s;coveries which are impo&s;ed upon it in the infancy of rea&s;on. Hence the impatience of children to be in|formed upon all &s;ubjects that relate to the invi&s;ible world. But I beg leave to a&s;k, why &s;hould we pur&s;ue a different plan of education with re&s;pect to religion, from that which we pur&s;ue in teaching the arts and &s;ciences? Do we leave our youth to acquire &s;y&s;tems of geography, philo&s;ophy, or politics, till they have arrived at an age in which they are capable of judging for them&s;elves? We do not. I claim no more then for religion, than for the other &s;ciences, and I add fur|ther, that if our youth are di&s;po&s;ed after they are of age to think for them&s;elves, a knowledge of one &s;y&s;tem, will be the be&s;t means of conducting them in a free enquiry into other &s;y&s;tems of religion, ju&s;t as an acquaintance with one &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy is the be&s;t introduction to the &s;tudy of all the other &s;y&s;tems in the world.</P>
<P>Next to the duty which young men owe to their Creator, I wi&s;h to &s;ee a regard to their country, incul|cated upon them. When the Duke of Sully became prime mini&s;ter to Henry the IVth of France, the fir&s;t thing he did, he tells us,
<Q>Was to &s;ubdue and forget his own heart.</Q>
The &s;ame duty is incumbent upon every citizen of a republic. Our country includes family, friends and property, and &s;hould be preferred to them all. Let our pupil be taught that he does not belong to him&s;elf, but that he is public property. Let him be taught to love his family, but let him be
<PB N="11" REF="034495_0017_0FFE00AE94936520">
taught, at the &s;ame time, that he mu&s;t for&s;ake, and even forget them, when the welfare of his country requires it. He mu&s;t watch for the &s;tate, as if its liberties depended upon his vigilance alone, but he mu&s;t do this in &s;uch a manner as not to defraud his creditors, or neglect his family. He mu&s;t love private life, but he mu&s;t decline no &s;tation, however public or re&s;pon&s;ible it may be, when called to it by the &s;uffrages of his fellow citizens. He mu&s;t love popularity, but he mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e it when &s;et in competition with the dictates of his judgement, or the real intere&s;t of his country. He mu&s;t love character, and have a due &s;en&s;e of injuries, but he mu&s;t be taught to appeal only to the laws of the &s;tate, to defend the one, and puni&s;h the other. He mu&s;t love family honour, but he mu&s;t be taught that neither the rank nor antiquity of his ance&s;tors, can command re&s;pect, without per&s;onal merit. He mu&s;t avoid neutrality in all que&s;tions that divide the &s;tate, but he mu&s;t &s;hun the rage, and acrimony of party &s;pir|it. He mu&s;t be taught to love his fellow creatures in every part of the world, but he mu&s;t cheri&s;h with a more inten&s;e and peculiar affection, the citizens of Penn&s;ylvania and of the United States. I do not wi&s;h to &s;ee our youth educated with a &s;ingle prejudice again&s;t any nation or country; but we impo&s;e a ta&s;k upon human nature, repugnant alike to rea&s;on, revelation and the ordinary dimen&s;ions of the human heart, when we require him to embrace, with equal affection, the whole family of mankind. He mu&s;t be taught to ama&s;s
<PB N="12" REF="034495_0018_0FFE00B01CF31A30">
wealth, but it mu&s;t be only to encrea&s;e his power of contributing to the wants and demands of the &s;tate. He mu&s;t be indulged occa&s;ionally in amu&s;ements, but he mu&s;t be taught that &s;tudy and bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be his principal pur&s;uits in life. Above all he mu&s;t love life, and endeavour to acquire as many of its convenien|ces as po&s;&s;ible by indu&s;try and economy, but he mu&s;t be taught that this life "is not his own," when the &s;afety of his country requires it. The&s;e are practica|ble le&s;&s;ons, and the hi&s;tory of the commonwealths of Greece and Rome &s;how, that human nature, without the aids of Chri&s;tianity, has attained the&s;e degrees of perfection.</P>
<P>While we inculcate the&s;e republican duties upon our pupil, we mu&s;t not neglect, at the &s;ame time, to in&s;pire him with republican principles. He mu&s;t be taught that there can be no durable liberty but in a republic, and that government, like all other &s;ciences, is of a progre&s;&s;ive nature. The chains which have bound this &s;cience in Europe are happily unloo&s;ed in America. Here it is open to inve&s;tigation and improvement. While philo&s;ophy has protected us by its di&s;coveries from a thou&s;and natural evils, government has unhap|pily followed with an unequal pace. It would be to di&s;honour human genius, only to name the many defects which &s;till exi&s;t in the be&s;t &s;y&s;tems of legi&s;lation.

&s;uch a way as not only to encrea&s;e the happine&s;s, but to promote the duration of republican forms of government far beyond the terms limited for them by hi&s;tory, or the common opinions of mankind.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t in rendering religious, moral and political in&s;truction more effectual upon the minds of our youth, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubject their bodies to phy&s;ical di&s;|cipline. To obviate the inconveniences of their &s;tudious and &s;edentary mode of life, they &s;hould live upon a temperate diet, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of broths, milk and vegetables. The black broth of Sparta, and the barley broth of Scotland, have been alike celebrated for their beneficial effects upon the minds of young people. They &s;hould avoid ta&s;ting Spirituous liquors. They &s;hould al&s;o be accu&s;tomed occa&s;ionally to work with their hands, in the intervals of Study, and in the bu&s;y &s;ea&s;ons of the year in the country. Moderate &s;leep, &s;ilence, occa&s;ional &s;olitude and cleanline&s;s, &s;hould be inculcated upon them, and the utmo&s;t advantage &s;hould be taken of a proper direction of tho&s;e great principles in human conduct,&mdash;&s;en&s;ibility, habit, imitations and a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>The influence of the&s;e phy&s;ical cau&s;es will be power|ful upon the intellects, as well as upon the principles and morals of young people.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who have &s;tudied human nature, it will not appear paradoxical to recommend, in this e&s;&s;ay, a particular attention to vocal mu&s;ic. Its mechanical
<PB N="14" REF="034495_0020_0FFE00B821B06B90">
effects in civilizing the mind, and thereby preparing it for the influence of religion and government, have been &s;o often felt and recorded, that it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to mention facts in favour of its u&s;efulne&s;s, in order to excite a proper attention to it.</P>
<P>I cannot help bearing a te&s;timony, in this place, again&s;t the cu&s;tom, which prevails in &s;ome parts of America, (but which is daily falling into di&s;u&s;e in Europe) of crouding boys together under one roof for the purpo&s;e of education. The practice is the gloomy remains of monki&s;h ignorance, and is as unfavorable to the improvements of the mind in u&s;eful learning, as mona&s;teries are to the &s;pirit of religion. I grant this mode of &s;ecluding boys from the intercour&s;e of private families, has a tendency to make them &s;cholars, but our bu&s;ine&s;s is to make them men, citizens and chri&s;tians. The vices of young people are generally learned from each other. The vices of adults &s;eldom infect them. By &s;eparating them from each other, therefore, in their hours of relaxation from &s;tudy, we &s;ecure their morals from a principal &s;ource of corruption, while we improve their manners, by &s;ubjecting them to tho&s;e re&s;traints which the difference of age and &s;ex, naturally produce in private families.</P>
<P>From the ob&s;ervations that have been made it is plain, that I con&s;ider it is po&s;&s;ible to convert men into repub|lican machines. This mu&s;t be done, if we expect them to perform their parts properly, in the great machine
<PB N="15" REF="034495_0021_0FFE00B9A9B9D6C8">
of the government of the &s;tate. That republic is &s;ophi&s;|ticated with monarchy or ari&s;trocracy that does not revolve upon the wills of the people, and the&s;e mu&s;t be fitted to each other by means of education before they can be made to produce regularity and uni&s;on in go|vernment.</P>
<P>Having pointed out tho&s;e general principles, which &s;hould be inculcated alike in all the &s;chools of the &s;tate, I proceed now to make a few remarks upon the method of conducting, what is commonly called, a liberal or learned education in a republic.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin this part of my &s;ubject, by bearing a te&s;timony again&s;t the common practice of attempting to teach boys the learned languages, and the arts and &s;ciences too early in life. The fir&s;t twelve years of life are barely &s;ufficient to in&s;truct a boy in reading, writing and arithmetic. With the&s;e, he may be taught tho&s;e modern languages which are nece&s;&s;ary for him to &s;peak. The &s;tate of the memory, in early life, is favorable to the acqui&s;ition of languages, e&s;pecially when they are conveyed to the mind, through the ear. It is, moreover, in early life only, that the organs of &s;peech yield in &s;uch a manner as to favour the ju&s;t pronounciation of foreign languages.</P>
<P>Too much pains cannot be taken to teach our youth to read and write our American language with propriety and elegance. The &s;tudy of the Greek language con&s;tituted a material part of the literature
<PB N="16" REF="034495_0022_0FFE00BB3383C268">
of the Athenians, hence the &s;ublimity, purity and immortality of &s;o many of their writings. The ad|vantages of a perfect knowledge of our language to young men intended for the profe&s;&s;ions of law, phy&s;ic, or divinity are too obvious to be mentioned, but in a &s;tate which boa&s;ts of the fir&s;t commercial city in America, I wi&s;h to &s;ee it cultivated by young men, who are intended for the compting hou&s;e, for many &s;uch, I hope, will be educated in our colleges. The time is pa&s;t when an academical education was thought to be unnece&s;&s;ary to qualify a young man for merchan|dize. I conceive no profe&s;&s;ion is capable of receiv|ing more embelli&s;hments from it. The French and German languages &s;hould likewi&s;e be carefully taught in all our Colleges. They abound with u&s;eful books upon all &s;ubjects. So important and nece&s;&s;ary are tho&s;e languages, that a degree &s;hould never be con|ferred upon a young man who cannot &s;peak or tran&s;late them.</P>
<P>Connected with the &s;tudy of languages is the &s;tudy of Eloquence. It is well known how great a part it con&s;tituted of the Roman education. It is the fir&s;t accompli&s;hment in a republic, and often &s;ets the whole machine of government in motion. Let our youth, therefore, be in&s;tructed in this art. We do not extol it too highly when we attribute as much to the power of eloquence as to the &s;word, in bring|ing about the American revolution.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="034495_0023_0FFE00BE060B5530">With the u&s;ual arts and &s;ciences that are taught in our American colleges, I wi&s;h to &s;ee a regular cour&s;e of lectures given upon Hi&s;tory and Chronology. The &s;cience of government, whether it related to con&s;titutions or laws, can only be advanced by a care|ful &s;election of facts, and the&s;e are to be found chiefly in hi&s;tory. Above all, let our youth be in&s;tructed in the hi&s;tory of the ancient republics, and the pro|gre&s;s of liberty and tyranny in the different &s;tates of Europe. I wi&s;h likewi&s;e to &s;ee the numerous facts that relate to the origin and pre&s;ent &s;tate of commerce, together with the nature and principles of Money, reduced to &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, as to be intelligible and a|greeable to a young man. If we con&s;ider the com|merce of our metropolis only as the avenue of the wealth of the &s;tate, the &s;tudy of it merits a place in a young man's education; but, I con&s;ider commerce in a much higher light when I recommend the &s;tudy of it in republican &s;eminaries. I view it as the be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t the influence of hereditary monopolies of land, and, therefore, the &s;ure&s;t protection again&s;t ari&s;tocracy. I con&s;ider its effects as next to tho&s;e of religion in humanizing mankind, and la&s;tly, I view it as the means of uniting the different nations of the world together by the ties of mutual wants and obligations.</P>
<P>Chemi&s;try by unfolding to us the effects of heat and mixture, enlarges our acquaintance with the wonders of nature and the my&s;teries of art; hence
<PB N="18" REF="034495_0024_0FFE00C35B66BD70">
it has become, in mo&s;t of the univer&s;ities of Europe, a nece&s;&s;ary branch of a gentleman's education. In a young country, where improvements in agriculture and manufactures are &s;o much to be de&s;ired, the cultiva|tion of this &s;cience, which explains the principles of both of them, &s;hould be con&s;idered as an object of the utmo&s;t importance.</P>
<P>Again, let your youth be in&s;tructed in all the means of promoting national pro&s;perity and inde|pendence, whether they relate to improvements in agriculture, manufactures, or inland navigation. Let him be in&s;tructed further in the general principles of legi&s;lation, whether they relate to revenue, or to the pre&s;ervation of life, liberty or property. Let him be directed frequently to attend the courts of ju&s;tice, where he will have the be&s;t opportunities of acquairing habits of comparing, and arranging his ideas by ob&s;erving the di&s;covery of truth, in the examination of witne&s;&s;es, and where he will hear the laws of the &s;tate explained, with all the advan|tages of that &s;pecies of eloquence which belongs to the bar. Of &s;o much importance do I conceive it to be, to a young man, to attend occa&s;ionally to the deci&s;ions of our courts of law, that I wi&s;h to &s;ee our colleges e&s;tabli&s;hed, only in county towns.</P>
<P>But further, con&s;idering the nature of our con|nection with the United States, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to make our pupil acquainted with all the prerogatives
<PB N="19" REF="034495_0025_0FFE00C4E4647B88">
of the national government. He mu&s;t be in&s;tructed in the nature and variety of treaties. He mu&s;t know the difference in the powers and duties of the &s;everal &s;pecies of amba&s;&s;adors. He mu&s;t be taught wherein the obligations of individuals and of &s;tates are the &s;ame, and wherein they differ. In &s;hort, he mu&s;t accquire a general knowledge of all tho&s;e laws and forms, which unite the &s;overeigns of the earth, or &s;eparate them from each other.</P>
<P>I beg pardon for having delayed &s;o long to &s;ay any thing of the &s;eparate and peculiar mode of education proper for women in a republic. I am &s;en&s;ible that they mu&s;t concur in all our plans of of education for young men, or no laws will ever render them effectual. To qualify our women for this purpo&s;e, they &s;hould not only be in&s;tructed in the u&s;ual branches of female education, but they &s;hould be taught the principles of liberty and go|vernment; and the obligations of patrioti&s;m &s;hould be inculcated upon them. The opinions and conduct of men are often regulated by the women in the mo&s;t arduous enterprizes of life; and their approbation is frequently the principal reward of the hero's dangers, and the patriot's toils. Be&s;ides, the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions upon the minds of children are gene|raly derived from the women. Of how much con|&s;equence, therefore, is it in a republic, that they &s;hould think ju&s;tly upon the great &s;ubjects of liberty and government!</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="034495_0026_0FFE00C66D471080">The complaints that have been made again&s;t religion, liberty and learning, have been, again&s;t each of them in a &s;eparate &s;tate.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS UPON THE STUDY OF THE LATIN AND GREEK LANGUAGES, AS A BRANCH OF LIBERAL EDUCATION, WITH HINTS OF A PLAN OF LIBERAL INSTRUCTION, WITHOUT THEM, ACCOMMODATED TO THE PRESENT STATE OF SOCIETY, MANNERS, AND GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<P>IT requires the recollection of e&s;capes from a lion and a bear, to encounter the &s;trong and univer&s;al prejudice, in favor of the Latin and Greek languages, as a nece&s;&s;ary branch of liberal education. If, in combating this formidable enemy of human rea&s;on, I &s;hould be le&s;s &s;uccesful than the Hebrew &s;tripling was in contending with the giant of the Phili&s;tines, I hope it will be a&s;cribed wholly to the want of &s;kill to direct arguments, which, in other hands, would lay this tyrant in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall attempt to di&s;cu&s;s this que&s;tion, by fir&s;t deliv|ering a few general propo&s;itions. I &s;hall afterwards apply the&s;e propo&s;itions, and an&s;wer &s;uch arguments as are u&s;ually urged in favor of the Latin and Greek languages as nece&s;&s;ary parts of an academic education.</P>
<P N="1">I. The great de&s;ign of a liberal education is, to prepare youth for u&s;efulne&s;s here, and for happine&s;s hereafter.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="22" REF="034495_0028_0FFE00CE63D0F9D0">II. The proper time for acquiring the nece&s;&s;ary branches of knowledge for the&s;e important purpo&s;es, is in the fir&s;t eighteen years of life.</P>
<P N="3">III. From four to five years are u&s;ually &s;pent in acquiring a competent knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The knowledge of things always preceeds the knowledge of words. Children di&s;cover the truth of this ob&s;ervation every day. They know all the objects around them, long before they are able to call them by their proper names, or even to arti|culate &s;ounds of any kind. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that children acquire more ideas of things in the fir&s;t three years of their lives, than they acquire in any thirty years afterwards.</P>
<P N="5">V. The acqui&s;ition of words le&s;&s;ens the ability of the mind to acquire ideas. That under&s;tanding mu&s;t have uncommon &s;trength, which does not contract an oblique direction by being employed four or five years in learning the Latin or Greek languages.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The difficulty of acquiring tho&s;e dead languages, and the little plea&s;ure which accompanies the knowledge of them in early life, occa&s;ion the principal ob&s;tacles to teaching, in ma&s;ters, and learning, in &s;cholars.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="034495_0029_0FFE00CFEC5DD190">The famous Bu&s;by is &s;aid to have died of "bad Latin;" that is, the ungrammatical ver&s;ions of his &s;cholars broke his heart. How few boys reli&s;h Latin and Greek le&s;&s;ons! The plea&s;ure they &s;ometimes di&s;cover in learning them, is derived either from the tales they read, or from a competition, which awak|ens a love of honour, and which might be di&s;|played upon a hundred more u&s;eful &s;ubjects; or it may ari&s;e from a de&s;ire of gaining the good will of their ma&s;ters or parents. Where the&s;e incentives are wanting, how bitter does the &s;tudy of languages render that innocent period of life, which &s;eems ex|clu&s;ively intended for happine&s;s! "I wi&s;h I had never been born," &s;aid a boy of eleven years old, to his mother: "why, my &s;on?" &s;aid his mother. "Be|cau&s;e I am born into a world of trouble."
<Q>What trouble,</Q>
&s;aid his mother &s;miling,
<Q>have you known, my &s;on?</Q>
&mdash;"Trouble enough, mamma," &s;aid he, "two Latin le&s;&s;ons to get, every day." This boy was not deficient in genius nor in application to books. He often amu&s;ed him&s;elf in reading natural and ancient hi&s;tory, was inqui&s;itive after knowledge of every kind, and was never heard to a&s;k a fooli&s;h or impertinent que&s;tion.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Many &s;prightly boys of excellent capacities for u&s;eful knowledge, have been &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted with the dead languages, as to retreat from the drudgery of &s;chools, to low company, whereby they have become bad mem|bers
<PB N="24" REF="034495_0030_0FFE00D174D3E918">
of &s;ociety, and entailed mi&s;ery upon all who have been connected with them.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The Latin and Greek languages are the fir&s;t te&s;ts of genius in &s;chools. Where boys di&s;cover a want of capacity for them, they are generally taken from &s;chool, or remain there the butts of their com|panions. Dr. Swift early di&s;covered a want of ta&s;te for the dead languages. It would be unju&s;t to men|tion this fact, without a&s;cribing it to the voice of rea&s;on and nature &s;peaking in this great man. He had no reli&s;h for the hu&s;ks of literature. Truth and knowledge were alone commen&s;urate to the dignity and extent of his mind.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The &s;tudy of &s;ome of the Latin and Greek cla&s;&s;ics is unfavourable to morals and religion. In|delicate amours, and &s;hocking vices both of gods and men, fill many parts of them. Hence an early and dangerous acquaintance with vice; and hence, from an a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, a dimin&s;hed re&s;pect for the unity and perfections of the true God. Tho&s;e cla&s;&s;ics which are free from this cen&s;ure, contain little el&s;e but the hi&s;tories of murders, per|petrated by kings, and related in &s;uch a manner as to excite plea&s;ure and admiration. Hence the univer&s;al preference of the military character to all others.&mdash;To the &s;ame cau&s;e we may a&s;cribe the early pa&s;&s;ion for a cockade in &s;chool boys; and the the frequent adoption of the principles and vices of
<PB N="25" REF="034495_0031_0FFE00D4438978C8">
armies, by young men who are de&s;tined for other profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P N="10">X. The &s;tudy of the Latin and Greek languages is improper in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety and government in United States. While Greek and Latin are the only avenues to &s;cience, education will always be confined to a few people. It is only by rendering knowledge univer&s;al, that a re|publican form of government can be pre&s;erved in our country.</P>
<P>I &s;hall hereafter mention other rea&s;ons why the &s;tudy of the&s;e languages is improper in a peculiar manner in the United States.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The cultivation of the Latin and Greek lan|guages is a great ob&s;tacle to the cultivation and perfection of the Engli&s;h language.</P>
<P N="12">XII. It is likewi&s;e one of the greate&s;t ob&s;tructions that has ever been thrown in the way of propagating u&s;eful knowledge.</P>
<P>On each of the&s;e two la&s;t propo&s;itions I &s;hall treat more fully in another place.</P>
<P>I proceed now to con&s;ider the principle arguments that have been urged in favour of the Latin and Greek languages, as nece&s;&s;ary parts of a liberal education.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="26" REF="034495_0032_0FFE00D9709272C0">1. A knowledge of the Latin or Greek grammar, it has been &s;aid, is nece&s;&s;ary for our becoming acquainted with Engli&s;h grammar. There was a time when the authority of a great name impo&s;ed this opinion upon me, and even led me publicly to adopt it, but I am now &s;atisfied that it is wholly de&s;titute of truth. I have known many bachelors and ma&s;ters of arts, who were incorrect Engli&s;h &s;cholars, and many per|&s;ons of both &s;exes, ignorant of the dead languages, who both wrote and &s;poke Engli&s;h, agreeably to the &s;tricte&s;t rules of modern grammar. Indeed I cannot help a&s;cribing the late improvements in the Engli&s;h language chiefly to the neglect of the Latin and Greek lanquages. The Greek is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the mo&s;t perfect language both in its con&s;truction and harmony, that has ever been &s;poken by mortals. Now this language was not learned through the medium of any other. Hence it was acquired and &s;poken with equal propriety by all ranks of people, and not le&s;s by an apple woman, than by the celebrated orators of Greece. In that highly favoured nur&s;ery of human genius, the avenues to knowledge were not ob&s;truct|ed by two or three dead, or even foreign languages; nor was the precious &s;ea&s;on of youth, when memory is mo&s;t faithful, and curio&s;ity mo&s;t active, mis &s;pent in learning words. Hence the fame of ancient Greece in arts and &s;ciences, and hence the &s;ublimity of the orations of Demo&s;thenes, and of the poems of Homer. There was nothing in the compo&s;ition
<PB N="27" REF="034495_0033_0FFE00DAF954DD58">
of the blood, or in the &s;tructure of the nerves of the ancient Greeks, which gave them a pre-eminence over the re&s;t of mankind. It aro&s;e entirely from their being too wi&s;e to wa&s;te the important years of edu|cation in learning to call &s;ub&s;tances, by two or three different names, in&s;tead of &s;tudying their qualities and u&s;es. The con&s;truction of the Engli&s;h, differs mate|rially from that of the Latin and Greek languages; and the attempt to accommodate it to the Greek and Roman grammars has checked its improvement in many in&s;tances. I hope to prove hereafter, that a knowledge of grammar, like a knowledge of pro|nunciation, &s;hould be learned only by the <HI>ear</HI> in early life. The practice of teaching boys Engli&s;h grammar, through the medium of a dead language, is as ab&s;urd, as it would be for a parent to force his child to chew peb|bles or mahogany, in order to prepare its gums or teeth to ma&s;ticate bread and meat.</P>
<P N="2">2. We are told that the Roman and Greek authors are the only perfect models of ta&s;te and eloquence, and that it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tudy them, in order to acquire their ta&s;te and &s;pirit. Strange language indeed! what! did nature exhau&s;t her&s;elf in Greece and Rome? Are the ancients the only repo&s;itories of the great principles of ta&s;te and genius? I reject the &s;uppo&s;ition; and will venture to a&s;&s;ert, in oppo&s;ition to it, that we &s;hall never equal the &s;ublime and original authors of antiquity until we cea&s;e to &s;tudy them.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="034495_0034_0FFE00DC8957CCC8">Nature is always the &s;ame. Let us yield to her in&s;pi|ration alone, and avail our&s;elves of allu&s;ions to the many di&s;coveries which have lately been made in her works. Shake&s;peare owes his fame, as a &s;ublime and original poet, to his having never read (as is generally believed) a Latin or Greek author. Hence he &s;poke from nature, or rather, nature &s;poke thro' him. But it &s;hould be remembered that art, as well as nature feeds the flame of genius. By neglecting the ancients, we may bor|row imagery from the many u&s;eful and well known arts which have been the inventions of modern ages, and thereby &s;urpa&s;s the antients in the variety and effect of our compo&s;itions. It is to this pa&s;&s;ion for ancient writers that we are to a&s;cribe the great want of originality, that marks too many of the poems of mod|ern times. A judicious critic has ob&s;erved, that the de&s;criptions of Spring, which are publi&s;hed every year in England, apply chiefly to the climates of Greece and the neighbourhood of Rome. This is the natural effect of a &s;ervile attachment to the ancient poets. It in&s;en&s;ibly checks invention and leads to imitation. The plea&s;ure with which the poems of the &s;hoemaker, the milk-maid, and the Ayre&s;hire ploughman, have been read by all cla&s;&s;es of people, proves that an acquaintance with the Greek or Roman poets, is not nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;pire ju&s;t ideas, or to produce harmony in poetry. Dr. Swift, as an author, owes nothing to the ancients. He has attained to what Pope calls the "maje&s;ty" and what Lord Shafte&s;bury calls the "divinene&s;s" of &s;im|plicity
<PB N="29" REF="034495_0035_0FFE00DF4DE94B68">
in writing. All his compo&s;itions, exemplify his own perfect definition of &s;tyle. They con&s;i&s;t of "proper words in their proper places." I have heard of a learned gentlemen in Scotland, who, when any of his friends propo&s;ed to introduce a &s;tranger to him, a&s;k|ed only, as a proof of his ta&s;te for compo&s;ition, whether he admired Dr. Young's Night Thoughts? Were I to receive a vi&s;itor upon &s;imilar terms, my only que&s;tion &s;hould be,
<Q>does he admire the &s;tyle of Dr. Swift?</Q></P>
<P>Under this head I &s;hall only add, that the mo&s;t intimate acquaintance with the Roman and Greek writers will not produce perfection of &s;tyle in men who are devoid of ta&s;te and genius. Hence we &s;ometimes find the mo&s;t celebrated teachers of the Latin and Greek languages extremely deficient in Engli&s;h compo|&s;ition. I acknowledge that Milton, Addi&s;on, Hume, Middleton and Bolingbroke, who&s;e &s;tyles have been &s;o much admired, were all Latin and Greek &s;cholars. But in the&s;e authors, a native &s;trength of genius, and ta&s;te pre&s;erved their writings from the affectation and ob&s;curity which are imparted to Engli&s;h compo&s;itions, by an adherence to the grammars and arrangement of the Latin and Greek languages.</P>
<P N="3">3. It has been &s;aid that we cannot know the u&s;e or meaning of tho&s;e numerous Engli&s;h words which are derived from the Latin and Greek, without a know|ledge of tho&s;e languages. To this I may an&s;wer, that

what proves too much, proves nothing at all. The argument that has been mentioned, proves that a knowledge of the Celtic, the Saxon, the German, the French, the Italian and the Dutch, is nece&s;&s;ary to ena|ble us to under&s;tand the u&s;e of many Engli&s;h words; for far the greate&s;t part of them are derived from tho&s;e languages. But I object further to this argument, that if a knowledge of the derivation of Engli&s;h words from the Greek and Latin languages, &s;hould be follow|ed by a &s;trict regard to their original meaning, it would lead us into many mi&s;takes. The derivation of the word "angel" would lead us to contemplate a me&s;&s;en|ger, in&s;tead of a perfect finite intelligence. The derivation of the word "rebellion" would lead us to contemplate a war commenced by a conquered people: in&s;tead of a re&s;i&s;tance to the ju&s;t authority of govern|ment. Many other in&s;tances of &s;imilar incongruity might be mentioned between the meaning of certain Engli&s;h words, and their Roman and Greek originals. I conclude therefore that a knowledge of the derivation of words is not nece&s;&s;ary to teach us their proper u&s;e and meaning. Cu&s;tom, which is the law and rule of &s;peech, and what <HI>is,</HI> in&s;tead of what <HI>&s;hould be</HI> common, will always govern the u&s;e of words. Where cu&s;tom is unknown, modern Engli&s;h dictionaries will &s;upply its place.</P>
<P>Here I beg leave to repeat that the &s;tudy of the Greek and Latin languages by the Engli&s;h nation has been one of the greate&s;t ob&s;tructions, that ever
<PB N="31" REF="034495_0037_0FFE00E605465B68">
has been thrown in the way of the propagation of u&s;eful knowledge. By rendering our language unintel|ligible to the greate&s;t part of the people who hear or read it, it has made it an improper vehicle of in&s;truction. The orations of Demo&s;thenes, we are told, were, like earthquakes in ancient Greece. They moved whole nations. The rea&s;on of this is plain. He never u&s;ed a &s;ingle word in any of them, but what was alike intelligible to all cla&s;&s;es of his hearers. The effect of Indian eloquence upon the councils and wars of the &s;avages in America, depends wholly upon its being perfectly under&s;tood and felt by every member of their communities. It has often been remarked that in England no play will &s;ucceed without action, while &s;entiment alone in&s;ures the loude&s;t claps of applau&s;e, in the theatres of France. The rea&s;on of this is obvious. The Engli&s;h lan|guage requires action to tran&s;late it, to half the common audience of a theatre, whereas the French language, which is uniform and &s;tationary, is un|der&s;tood, and, of cour&s;e, the &s;entiment which is conveyed by it, is felt and enjoyed by all who hear it. The writings of Voltaire are quoted by the hairdre&s;&s;ers and milliners of Paris, becau&s;e they are written in the &s;imple language of the country, while many of the mo&s;t celebrated Briti&s;h authors cannot be under&s;tood by common readers, without the help of a dictionary or interpreter. Richard&s;on and Fielding are an exception to this remark. They are alike intelligible and acceptable to the learned and
<PB N="32" REF="034495_0038_0FFE00E7904ADA48">
unlearned, ina&s;much as they have conveyed all their ideas in plain, but decent Engli&s;h words. The po|pularity of the methodi&s;t preachers may be a&s;cribed in part to their &s;peaking in a language that is intel|ligible to the common people. It is true&punc; many of them are deficient in education, but this deficiency appears more in an ignorance of the con&s;truction of the Engli&s;h language, than in the proper u&s;e of Engli&s;h words, and perhaps this may be a&s;cribed chiefly to their extempore mode of preaching. It is happy for &s;ome of tho&s;e churches where the Latin and Greek languages are con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;ary parts for education in their clergy, that part of the public wor&s;hip of God is confined to reading the &s;criptures, and to forms of prayer, both of which are written in Engli&s;h, and are intelligible to every cla&s;s of hearers. Such congregations are not left to the mercy of their preach|ers in every part of divine &s;ervice. A pious woman in London who heard her mini&s;ter &s;peak of the Deity, by the name of the great Philanthropi&s;t, a&s;ked when &s;he came home, what heathen god Philanthropi&s;t was? There are few &s;ermons compo&s;ed by Latin and Greek &s;cholars in which there are not many hundred words, that are equally unintelligible to a majority of their hearers. Hence I cannot help thinking that were John the Bapti&s;t to appear again in our world, and to &s;end to &s;ome of our doctors of divinity, or to many of our young preachers to enquire after the &s;igns of their divine mi&s;&s;ion, few of them could adopt the an&s;wer
<PB N="33" REF="034495_0039_0FFE00EA52460638">
of our Saviour and &s;ay that to the poor the go&s;pel was "preached." It will require a total ignorance of the Latin and Greek languages, or an uncommon mixture of good &s;en&s;e and piety in a preacher who is acquaint|ed with them, to addre&s;s an audience in &s;uch a manner as to be perfectly under&s;tood by the illiterate part of them.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to pre&s;s the con&s;iderations that have been mentioned under this head, home to the feelings of the friends of virtue and religion. It has been demon|&s;trated, that the &s;tudy of the ancient cla&s;&s;ics is hurtful to morals. It is equally plain that the corruption of our language by the con&s;tant &s;ub&s;titution of words of Greek and Latin origin, to tho&s;e which had become familiar and univer&s;al, from long u&s;age, has greatly re|tarded the progre&s;s of knowledge of all kinds, but in a more e&s;pecial manner, a great proportion of that &s;pecies of it which is delivered from the pulpit. I appeal to the con&s;ciences of mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel of all denominations, whether, in&s;tead of expo&s;ing their their candidates for the mini&s;try, to temptation from that kind of learning
<Q>which puffeth up, without edifying,</Q>
it would not be better to direct them to employ the time which is u&s;ually mi&s;-pent in acquiring it, in &s;tudying the &s;criptures, and in making them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the Engli&s;h language? It is im|po&s;&s;ible to tell what great improvements would be made by the&s;e means in moral happine&s;s in the United States.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="34" REF="034495_0040_0FFE00EF91151BA0">4. We are told that a knowledge of the Greek and Roman languages, is nece&s;&s;ary to enable us to under|&s;tand the frequent allu&s;ions that are made by Engli&s;h writers to the mythology of tho&s;e ancient nations. To this I an&s;wer, that the le&s;s we know of this &s;ubject, the better; for what is the hi&s;tory of the ancient fables, but an agreeable de&s;cription of frauds&mdash;rapes&mdash;and murders, which, while they plea&s;e the imagination, &s;hock the moral faculty? It is high time to cea&s;e from idolizing the idolatry of Greece and Rome. Truth alone is knowledge, and &s;pending time in &s;tudying Greek and Roman fictions, is only labouring to be more ignorant. If there is any moral contained in the&s;e fictions, it is &s;o much involved in ob&s;curity, as not to be intelligible to a young man at that time of life in which he u&s;ually becomes acquainted with them. Happy will it be for the pre&s;ent and future generations, if an ignorance of the Latin and Greek languages, &s;hould bani&s;h from modern poetry, tho&s;e di&s;graceful invocations of heathen gods, which indicate no le&s;s a want of genius, than a want of reverence for the true God. I &s;hall only add in this place, that the be&s;t writers in the Engli&s;h language &s;eldom borrow allu|&s;ions from the mythology of the Greek or Roman nations. Richard&s;on and Fielding have pa&s;&s;ed them by, and hence ari&s;es another rea&s;on why the works of tho&s;e authors are &s;o univer&s;ally intelligible and acceptable to to all cla&s;&s;es of readers.</P>

It has been &s;aid, that the Latin language has become a nece&s;&s;ary part of liberal knowledge, inas|much as the European nations have by common con|&s;ent made it the vehicle of their di&s;coveries. This argument had &s;ome weight while &s;cience con&s;i&s;ted on|ly learning what was known; but &s;ince the enquiries of philo&s;ophers have been directed to new objects of ob&s;ervation and experiment, the Latin language has not been able to keep pace with the number and ra|pidity of their di&s;coveries. Where &s;hall we find Latin words to convey ju&s;t ideas of the many terms which electricity&mdash;chemi&s;try&mdash;navigation&mdash;and many other &s;ciences have introduced into our modern languages? It is from experience of the in&s;ufficiency of the Latin language for this purpo&s;e, that mo&s;t of the modern na|tions of Europe have been obliged to adopt their own languages, as the vehicles of their di&s;coveries, in &s;cience. If this argument had been acknowledged to have weight in Europe, it &s;hould, from local circum|&s;tances, have no weight in America. Here we have no intercour&s;e with any part of Europe, except her com|mercial &s;eaports, and in the&s;e, all bu&s;ine&s;s is tran&s;|acted in modern languages. America, with re&s;pect to the nations of Europe, is like the new planet, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e, who&s;e revolutions have long been de&s;cribed in the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem. She is placed at too great a di&s;tance from mo&s;t of them, to be within the influence of a reciprocal exchange of the rays of knowledge. Like a certain animal, de&s;cribed by the

<P N="6">6. It has been &s;aid that a knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages is nece&s;&s;ary to the learned pro|fe&s;&s;ions of law&mdash;phy&s;ic&mdash;and divinity. To this I an|&s;wer, that the mo&s;t u&s;eful books in each of the&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ions are now tran&s;lated, or written in Engli&s;h, in con&s;equence of which, knowledge in law&mdash;phy&s;ic&mdash; and divinity has been greatly multiplied and extended. I &s;ee no u&s;e at pre&s;ent for a knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages, for a lawyer, a phy&s;ician, or a divine, in the United States, except it be to facilitate the remembrance of a few technical terms which may be retained without it. Two of the mo&s;t celebrated and &s;ucce&s;sful lawyers in the United States, are &s;trangers to the Latin language. An eminent phy&s;ician, who &s;pent &s;everal of the years of his youth in learning this language, has a&s;&s;ured me, that he had not more than three times in his life found any advantage from it. Very few phy&s;icians, I believe, (profe&s;&s;ors of medecine only excepted, who are obliged to review Latin the&s;es previou&s;ly to their publication) retain their knowledge of this language, after they become e&s;tabli&s;hed in bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and if they do, it is pre&s;erved le&s;s from nece&s;&s;ity, than from vanity, or a de&s;ire of reviving, by reading
<PB N="37" REF="034495_0043_0FFE00F5A59E8610">
the cla&s;&s;ics, the agreeable ideas of the early and inno|cent part of their lives.</P>
<P>I know that it is commonly believed, that a know|ledge of the Greek language, is nece&s;&s;ary to enable a divine fully to under&s;tand the New Te&s;tament. But I object to this opinion, that the mo&s;t u&s;eful and ne|ce&s;&s;ary parts of this divine book are intelligible to the lowe&s;t capacities in its pre&s;ent Engli&s;h dre&s;s: and I believe further, that there have been as many di&s;putes among the critics, about the meaning of words, and about editions and tran&s;lations of the New Te&s;tament, as there have been among unlearned chri&s;tians about the meaning of its ob&s;cure and difficult pa&s;&s;ages. If a knowledge of the Greek language be nece&s;&s;ary to enable a divine to under&s;tand the New Te&s;tament, it follows, that a critical knowledge of all the dialects in which the different parts of it were origi|nally compo&s;ed, is equally nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e; and, if nece&s;&s;ary to a divine, why not to the common people, for they are equally intere&s;ted in all the truths of revelation? The difficulties and ab|&s;urdities into which we are led by this propo&s;ition, are too obvious to be mentioned.</P>
<P>We are very apt to forget the <HI>age</HI> in which we live. In the fifteenth century, all the knowledge of Europe was locked up in a few Greek and Latin manu&s;cripts. In this confined &s;tate of knowledge, an acquaintance with the Latin language was thought to be nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="38" REF="034495_0044_0FFE00FAE5500080">
to civilize the human mind&mdash;hence the teachers of it acquired the title of "profe&s;&s;ors of humanity" in the European univer&s;ities. But we live in an age in which knowledge has been drawn from its dead repo|&s;itories, and diffu&s;ed by the art of printing, in living languages, through every part of the world. Huma|nity has therefore changed &s;ides. Her gentlene&s;s is now altogether in favour of modern literature.</P>
<P>We forget not only the age, but the country like|wi&s;e in which we live. In Europe many ancient con|&s;titutions&mdash;laws&mdash;treaties&mdash;official letters&mdash;and even private deeds, are written in Latin&mdash;hence the know|ledge of it has &s;ometimes been found u&s;eful for &s;tates|men and lawyers&mdash;but all the con&s;titutions, laws, treaties, public letters, and private deeds of the United States, are written in Engli&s;h; and of cour&s;e a know|ledge of the Latin language is not nece&s;&s;ary to un|der&s;tand them. It is therefore as u&s;ele&s;s in America, as the Spani&s;h great-coat is in the i&s;land of Cuba, or the Dutch foot-&s;tove, at the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>We forget further the difference of <HI>occupation</HI> be|tween the inhabitants of the pre&s;ent, and of the fifteenth century. Formerly public prayers and war were the only bu&s;ine&s;s of man: but &s;ince agriculture, manufac|tures and commerce, have afforded &s;uch different and profitable employments to mankind, there cannot be greater folly than to learn two languages which are no ways connected with the advancement of any of them.</P>

<Q>I once thought health, the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing in the world,</Q>
&s;aid Mr. Rittenhou&s;e to the author of this e&s;&s;ay,
<Q>but I do not think &s;o now. There is one thing of much greater value, and that is time.</Q>
This opinion of our excellent American philo&s;opher, is true every where, but in a more e&s;pecial manner in the United States. Here the opportunities of acquiring knowledge and of advancing private and public intere&s;t are &s;o numerous, and the rewards of genius and in|du&s;try &s;o certain, that not a particle of time &s;hould be mis-&s;pent or lo&s;t. We occupy a new country. Our principal bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be to explore and apply its re&s;ources, all of which pre&s;s us to enterprize and ha&s;te. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, to &s;pend four or five years in learning two dead languages, is to turn our backs upon a gold mine, in order to amu&s;e our&s;elves in catching butterflies.</P>
<P>It is agreeable to hear of the progre&s;s of human rea&s;on in the gradual declen&s;ion of the u&s;ual methods of teaching the Latin and Greek languages within the la&s;t forty years in Europe. Formerly boys were obliged to commit whole volumes of Latin and Greek poetry to memory, as the only means of learning tho&s;e languages. Nor was this all; they were obliged to compo&s;e Latin ver&s;es without the lea&s;t regard being paid to genius, or ta&s;te for poetry. The la&s;t act of &s;chool tyranny, was to compel boys to read the ancient cla&s;&s;ics without the help of tran&s;lations. All the&s;e methods of teaching the dead languages are now laid
<PB N="40" REF="034495_0046_0FFE00FF2EF4C080">
a&s;ide. The next ray of truth that irradiates human rea&s;on upon this &s;ubject, I hope will teach us to reject the Latin and Greek languages altogether, as branches of a liberal education.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of human rea&s;on &s;hould likewi&s;e be acknowledged in having bani&s;hed Latin and Greek quotations from &s;ermons, and other religious tracts, which are intended for the common people. Such quotations are to be found only in books of &s;cience, addre&s;&s;ed to the members of the learned profe&s;&s;ions, or to per&s;ons who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be acquainted with the Latin and Greek languages.</P>
<P>There are certain follies, like the objects of &s;ight, which cannot be &s;een when the eye is placed too near them. We are &s;truck with pity and horror in con|templating the folly di&s;covered by our ance&s;tors in their military expeditions to the holy land of Pale&s;tine. The generations which are to follow us, will probably view our partiality to the cla&s;&s;ic ground of Greece and Rome, with &s;imilar emotions. We laugh at the credulity of tho&s;e nations who wor&s;hipped apes and crocodiles, without recollecting, that future ages will treat our &s;uper&s;titious veneration for the ancient poets and ora|tors, with the &s;ame ridicule. Po&s;terity, in reading the hi&s;tory of the American revolution, will wonder that in a country where &s;o many exploits of wi&s;dom and virtue were performed, the human under&s;tanding was fettered by prejudices in favour of the Latin and Greek
<PB N="41" REF="034495_0047_0FFE0100ED031628">
languages. But I hope with the hi&s;tory of this folly, &s;ome hi&s;torian will convey to future generations, that many of the mo&s;t active and u&s;eful characters in accompli&s;hing this revolution, were &s;trangers to the formalities of a Latin and Greek education.</P>
<P>It is high time to di&s;tingui&s;h between a philo&s;opher, and a &s;cholar, between things and words.

This young man was an excellent Latin and Greek &s;cholar, but knew nothing of men, or things.</P>
<P>Let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed from any thing that has been here advanced, that I wi&s;h the knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages to be extinct in the world. Far from it. My wi&s;h is to &s;ee it pre&s;erved, like the know|ledge of law, or medicine, as a di&s;tinct profe&s;&s;ion. Let the per&s;ons, who devote them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of the&s;e languages, be called lingui&s;ts, or interpreters, and let them be paid for their tran&s;lations and explanations of Latin and Greek books, and other compo&s;itions in tho&s;e languages. No more confidence will be placed by the public, in the members of this new profe&s;&s;ion, than is daily placed in lawyers and phy&s;icians, in matters of much greater importance; nor will more

credit be given to them, than we are accu&s;tomed to give to travellers and hi&s;torians. There can be no more rea&s;on why every man &s;hould be capable of tran&s;lating or judging of a Latin or Greek book, than there can be why every man &s;hould be a lawyer or a phy&s;ician, or why he &s;hould be obliged to vi&s;it Con&s;tantinople or Grand Cairo, in order to become acquainted with the &s;ituation of the&s;e two great cities. If this method of pre&s;erving and applying the dead languages &s;hould be adopted, young men will learn them as they do law and phy&s;ic, by &s;erving an apprentice&s;hip, in&s;tead of going to &s;chool.</P>
<P>The following advantages would immediately attend the rejection of the Latin and Greek languages as branches of a liberal education.</P>
<P N="1">1. It would improve, and finally perfect the Engli&s;h language, by checking the increa&s;e of tho&s;e &s;uperfluous words which are derived from the Latin and Greek languages. What u&s;e have we for fe&s;tivity&mdash;celebrity &mdash;hilarity&mdash;amenity&mdash;and a hundred other duplicate words, with which John&s;on and Harris have corrupted and weakened our language, and which are unintelli|gible to three fourths of common Engli&s;h readers? The rejection of the ancient languages, would further bani&s;h Latin and Greek words, &s;uch as, <HI>exit, fecit, excudit, pinxit, acme, finis, bona fide, ip&s;o facto, ad valo|rem,</HI> and a hundred others, equally di&s;gu&s;ting, from Engli&s;h compo&s;itions. It would moreover pre&s;erve
<PB N="43" REF="034495_0049_0FFE0109117C8C18">
our language from encroachments of French and Ita|lian words, &s;uch as <HI>eclat&mdash;amateur&mdash;douceur&mdash;en pa&s;&s;ant &mdash;corps&mdash;dilettanti&mdash;con cuore&mdash;piano</HI> and many others, all of which impair the uniformity and dignity of the Engli&s;h language.</P>
<P N="2">2. The rejection of the Latin and Greek langauges from our &s;chools, would produce a revolution in &s;cience, and in human affairs. That nation which &s;hall fir&s;t &s;hake off the fetters of tho&s;e ancient languages, will advance further in knowledge, and in happine&s;s, in twenty years, than any nation in Europe has done, in a hundred.</P>
<P N="3">3. It will have a tendency to de&s;troy the prejudices of the common people again&s;t &s;chools and colleges. The common people do not de&s;pi&s;e &s;cholars, becau&s;e they know more, but becau&s;e they know le&s;s than them|&s;elves. A mere &s;cholar can call a hor&s;e, or a cow, by two or three different names, but he frequently knows nothing of the qualities, or u&s;es of tho&s;e valuable animals.</P>
<P N="4">4. It would be the means of bani&s;hing pride from our &s;eminaries of public education. Men are generally mo&s;t proud of tho&s;e things that do not contribute to the happine&s;s of them&s;elves, or others. U&s;eful know|ledge generally humbles the mind, but learning, like fine clothes, feeds pride, and thereby hardens the hu|man heart.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="44" REF="034495_0050_0FFE010ACAE05128">5. It would greatly encrea&s;e the number of &s;tudents in our colleges, and thereby extend the benefits of education through every part of our country. The excellency of knowledge would then be obvious to every body, becau&s;e it would be con&s;tantly applicable to &s;ome of the nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful purpo&s;es of life, and particularly to the &s;ecurity and order of wi&s;e and ju&s;t government.</P>
<P N="6">6. It would remove the pre&s;ent immen&s;e di&s;parity which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the &s;exes, in the degrees of their education and knowledge. Perhaps one cau&s;e of the mi&s;ery of many families, as well as communities, may be &s;ought for in the <HI>mediocrity</HI> of knowledge of the women. They &s;hould know <HI>more</HI> or <HI>le&s;s,</HI> in order to be happy them&s;elves, and to communicate happine&s;s to others. By cea&s;ing to make Latin and Greek a nece&s;&s;ary part of a liberal education, we open the doors for every &s;pecies of improvement to the female part of &s;ociety:&mdash;hence will ari&s;e new plea&s;ures in their com|pany,&mdash;and hence, too, we may expect a general reformation and refinement, in the generations which are to follow us; for principles and manners in all &s;ocieties are formed chiefly by the women.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked here, how &s;hall we employ tho&s;e years of a boy, that are now u&s;ually &s;pent in learning the Latin and Greek languages? I &s;hall endeavour to an&s;wer this que&s;tion by laying down a &s;hort plan of a liberal Engli&s;h education. In this undertaking, I &s;hall
<PB N="45" REF="034495_0051_0FFE010C540296D0">
&s;trive to forget for a while all the &s;y&s;tems of education I have ever &s;een, and &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch a one as is founded in the original principles of action in the human mind.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let the fir&s;t eight years of a boy's time be em|ployed in learning to &s;peak, &s;pell, read and write the Engli&s;h language. For this purpo&s;e, let him be com|mitted to the care of a ma&s;ter, who &s;peaks correctly at all times, and let the books he reads, be written in a &s;imple and correct &s;tyle. During the&s;e years, let not an Engli&s;h grammar by any means be put into his hands. It is to mo&s;t boys, under even twelve years of age, an unintelligible book. As well might we contend, that a boy &s;hould be taught the names and number of the humours of the eye, or the mu&s;cles of the tongue, in order to learn to &s;ee, or to &s;peak, as be taught the Engli&s;h language, by means of grammar. Sancho, in attempting to learn to read, by chewing the four and twenty letters of the alphabet, did not exhib|it a greater ab&s;urdity, than a boy of &s;even or eight years old does, in committing grammar rules to memory, in order to under&s;tand the Engli&s;h language. Did we wi&s;h to de&s;cribe a &s;hip, &s;o as to have all its parts perfectly and &s;peedily known, would we begin by de&s;cribing its detached parts in a &s;hip-yard, or a rope-walk? Or would we not fir&s;t fix every part in its proper place, and then explain the names and u&s;es of the&s;e parts, by &s;hewing their &s;ub&s;erviency to each other? In like manner, I af|firm, that the con&s;truction of our language &s;hould be learned by a careful attention to the places and u&s;es of the
<PB N="46" REF="034495_0052_0FFE0111836D7100">
different parts of &s;peech in agreeable compo&s;itions, and not by contemplating them in a disjointed &s;tate in an Engli&s;h grammar. But I will add further, that grammar &s;hould be taught only by the ear. Pro|nounciation, which is far more exten&s;ive, and dif|ficult, is learned only in this way. To teach con|cord in the arrangement of words, let the ma&s;ter conver&s;e with his pupils as well as hear them read, and let him di&s;tinctly mark and correct every devi|ation from grammatical propriety which they utter. This method of teaching grammar has been tried with &s;ucce&s;s in the families of &s;everal gentlemen of my acquaintance. It is both rational, and practicable. It has, moreover, the authority of the wi&s;e Greeks to re|commend it. Homer, Xenophon, Demo&s;thenes and Longinus, I believe, were all taught to &s;peak, read, and write their native language, without the incum|brance of a Greek grammar. I do not mean by any thing that has been advanced, to in&s;inuate that our pupil &s;hould not be in&s;tructed in the principles and laws of our language. I have re&s;erved this part of know|ledge to a much later period of his youth, at which time he will acquire it almo&s;t as &s;oon as Moliere's "Citizen turned Gentleman," learned to di&s;tingui&s;h between pro&s;e and poetry. He will find that he is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this knowledge, and that the bu&s;ine&s;s of his ma&s;ter will be only to give names to things with which he is already acquainted.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="034495_0053_0FFE01130B676348">Under this head, I &s;hall only add, that the perfec|tion of the ear, as an avenue of knowledge is not &s;ufficiently known. Ideas acquired through that or|gan, are much more durable, than tho&s;e acquired by the eyes. We remember much longer what we hear, than what we &s;ee; hence, old men recollect voices, long after they forget faces. The&s;e facts are capable of great application to the bu&s;ine&s;s of educa|tion.</P>
<P>Having provided our pupil with a vehicle of know|ledge, by teaching him to read and write, our next bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be to furni&s;h him with ideas. Here it will be nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that the human mind in early life fir&s;t comprehends &s;ub&s;tances. From the&s;e it proceeds to actions, from actions to qualities, and from qualities to degrees. Let us therefore in edu|cation, follow this order of nature, and begin by in|&s;tructing our pupil in the knowledge of &s;ub&s;tances, or things. For this purpo&s;e, let us initiate him into the knowledge of the globe on which he exi&s;ts, by teach|ing him</P>
<P N="2">2. Natural hi&s;tory. This &s;tudy is &s;imple and truly delightful. Animals of all kinds are often the &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation and di&s;putes among boys in their walks and diver&s;ions. But this is not all; this &s;tudy is the foundation of all u&s;eful and practical knowledge in agriculture, manufactures and commerce, as well as in philo&s;ophy, chemi&s;try, and medecine. By making
<PB N="48" REF="034495_0054_0FFE0114972C3870">
natural hi&s;tory the fir&s;t &s;tudy of a boy, we imitate the conduct of the fir&s;t teacher of man. The fir&s;t le&s;&s;on that Adam received from his Maker in Para|di&s;e, was upon natural hi&s;tory. It is probable that the dominion of our great progenitor over the brute creation, and every other living creature, was founded upon a perfect knowledge of their names and qualities, for God appears in this, as well as in other in&s;tances, to have acted by the in&s;trumentality of human rea|&s;on.&mdash;Where a mu&s;eum is wanting, all that is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for a boy to know of animals and fi&s;hes&mdash;in&s;ects &mdash;trees and herbs, may be taught by means of prints.</P>
<P N="3">3. Geography, is a &s;imple &s;cience, and accom|modated to the capacity of a boy under twelve years of age. It may be perfectly under&s;tood by means of cards&mdash;globes&mdash;and maps; for each of the&s;e modes of conveying in&s;truction, &s;eizes upon the &s;en&s;es and imagination. The frequent application which a boy is obliged to make of his knowledge in geography, in reading, and conver&s;ation, will &s;oon fix it upon his memory, and from the <HI>time</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> in which he will acquire it, he will never forget it.</P>
<P>I allow four years to be employed in acquiring the&s;e two fundamental branches of knowledge. After our pupil has become tolerably well acquainted with them, he &s;hould be in&s;tructed in the</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="49" REF="034495_0055_0FFE01175A989030">4. French and German languages. The&s;e will be equally nece&s;&s;ary, whether commerce&mdash;phy&s;ic&mdash;law or divinity is the pur&s;uit of a young man. They &s;hould be acquired only by the ear. Great care &s;hould be taken not to permit him to learn the&s;e languages be|fore he is <HI>twelve</HI> years old, otherwi&s;e he will contract &s;o much of the French and German accent as will impair the prononciation of his native tongue.</P>
<P N="5">5. Arithmetic, and &s;ome of the more &s;imple branches of the mathematics &s;hould be acquired be|tween the twelfth and fourteenth years of his life.</P>
<P N="6">6. Between his fourteenth and eighteenth years, he &s;hould be in&s;tructed in grammar&mdash;oratory&mdash;criti|ci&s;m&mdash;the higher branches of mathematics&mdash;philo&s;ophy &mdash;chemi&s;try&mdash;logic&mdash;metaphy&s;ics&mdash;chronology&mdash;hi&s;to|ry&mdash;government&mdash;the principles of agriculture, and manufactures&mdash;and in every thing el&s;e that is nece&s;&s;ary to qualify him for public u&s;efulne&s;s, or private hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P N="7">7. I know it is common to introduce what is called <HI>Moral Philo&s;ophy</HI> into a &s;y&s;tem of liberal education. The name of this &s;cience is derived from the Pagan &s;chools. The &s;tudy of it con&s;tituted a material part of their learning. In&s;tead of continuing this anti-chri&s;tian mode of teaching morals, I would propo&s;e a cour&s;e of lectures to be given upon the evidences, doctrines and <HI>precepts</HI> of the Chri&s;tian religion. The la&s;t part of this
<PB N="50" REF="034495_0056_0FFE011C9759B110">
cour&s;e might be made to include the whole circle of moral duties, and from the connection it would have with the evidences and doctrines of Chri&s;tanity it would produce an impre&s;&s;ion upon the under&s;tanding which no time or circum&s;tances would ever wear away. It is by neglecting to teach young men the Chri&s;|tian religion as a &s;cience, or by the &s;eparation of its morals from its principles, that colleges have become in &s;o many in&s;tances the nur&s;eries of infidelity.</P>

<HEAD>ANSWER to the foregoing letter, containing further ob&s;ervations upon the &s;tudy of the Latin and Greek lan|guages.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT gave me great plea&s;ure to find, by your polite letter of July 29th, that my opinions, upon the &s;ubject of the Latin and Greek languages, have met with your approbation; and that the young gentlemen who compo&s;e your academy had di&s;covered &s;o much good &s;en&s;e in preferring <HI>u&s;eful</HI> to <HI>u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> or, at be&s;t, ornamental literature.</P>
<P>I have read all the replies that have been publi&s;hed to my opinions: and am more confirmed in the truth of them, than ever, by the weakne&s;s and fallacy of the objections that have been made to them. The &s;tyle of &s;ome of tho&s;e replies has e&s;tabli&s;hed one of my pro|po&s;itions in the mo&s;t forcible manner. It has demon|&s;trated that a knowledge of the dead languages does not confer ta&s;te or elegance in the Engli&s;h language, any more than it does good breeding, or good temper. I except from this remark the candid and ingenious letters publi&s;hed in the Federal Gazette, &s;aid to be written by Dr. Stuber, of this city.</P>
<P>To per&s;uade men, that white is <HI>black,</HI> or black, <HI>white,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary &s;ometimes to make them believe that they are <HI>grey.</HI> The mind requires a re&s;ting point, in pa&s;&s;ing from error to truth, upon many &s;ubjects. I &s;hall avail my&s;elf of this weakne&s;s in human nature, and take the
<PB N="52" REF="034495_0058_0FFE011FA9871E68">
liberty of &s;ugge&s;ting a method of teaching the Latin and Greek languages, which I conceive, will be ac|commodated to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the prejudices of our countrymen in their favour.</P>
<P>The late Dr. Franklin u&s;ed to &s;ay, that the learning of a dead or foreign language might be divided into <HI>ten</HI> parts. That it required <HI>five</HI> only to learn to read it&mdash;<HI>&s;even</HI> to &s;peak it&mdash;and the whole <HI>ten</HI> to write it. Now, when we con&s;ider how &s;eldom we are called upon to <HI>&s;peak</HI> or <HI>write</HI> the Latin or Greek languages, &s;uppo&s;e we teach our boys only to <HI>read</HI> them. This will cut off one half the difficulty of learning them, and and enable a boy to acquire as much of <HI>both,</HI> in two years, as will be nece&s;&s;ary for him. He will, moreover, by this plan, be able to read more of the cla&s;&s;ics than are read at pre&s;ent in our &s;chools. The cla&s;&s;ics are now read only for the &s;ake of acquiring a knowledge of the con&s;truction of the languages in which they are written; but by the plan I have propo&s;ed, they would be read for the &s;ake of the matter they contained, and there would be time enough to read each book from its beginning to its end. At pre&s;ent, what boy ever reads all the Aenead of Virgil, or the Iliad of Homer? In &s;hort, few boys ever carry with them from &s;chool, any thing but a &s;mattering of the cla&s;&s;ics. They peep into a dozen of them; but are taught to attend to every thing they contain, more than to <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> which are treated of by them.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="034495_0059_0FFE01226C6B5298">In the way I have propo&s;ed, a boy would be able to tran&s;late all the Latin and Greek books he would meet with, and from the perfect knowledge he would acquire of them at &s;chool, he would probably retain that knowledge as long as he lived.</P>
<P>To carry this mode of teaching the Latin and Greek languages into effect, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that a boy &s;hould fir&s;t be in&s;tructed in <HI>hi&s;tory</HI> and <HI>geography.</HI> Let him read an account of the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and fall of the Greek and Roman nations; and examine, upon maps, the countries they inhabited and conquered, and their languages will &s;oon become intere&s;ting to him. The neglect of this natural and ea&s;y mode of in&s;truc|tion, is an inver&s;ion of all order. The ab&s;urdity of it was once happily expo&s;ed by a boy of eight years old, who, with a Latin Grammar in his hand, gravely a&s;ked his father,
<Q>who made the Latin language, and what was it made for?</Q>
Had this boy been previou&s;ly in&s;tructed in the Roman hi&s;tory, he would not have a&s;ked &s;uch a que&s;tion. Con&s;idering his age, it was as natural, as it was fooli&s;h.</P>
<P>There is no play common among children, that &s;trikes me with an idea of half the folly that I am &s;truck with, every time I look into a Latin &s;chool, and &s;ee thirty or forty little boys pinioned down to benches, and declining nouns, conjugating verbs, or writing Latin ver&s;ions. I con&s;ider the highe&s;t attainment in this kind of learning, as nothing more than &s;ucce&s;sful do&s;|tards,
<PB N="54" REF="034495_0060_0FFE0127A6E6FFE8">
but far le&s;s u&s;eful than tho&s;e which are exhibited in the u&s;ual athletic excerci&s;es of &s;chool boys.</P>
<P>By adopting the plan I have propo&s;ed, a boy will not open a Latin or Greek book, till he is fourteen or fifteen years old; &s;o that the dead languages, in&s;tead of being the fir&s;t, will be the la&s;t things he will learn at &s;chool. At this age, he will learn them with half the trouble, and under&s;tand them much better than he would have done at nine or ten years of age. For though languages are acquired with mo&s;t ea&s;e by the <HI>ear</HI> under puberty, yet they are acquired mo&s;t ea&s;ily by the <HI>eye,</HI> after that period of life. But there is another advantage in making the Latin and Greek languages the la&s;t things that are taught at &s;chool. The bent of a young man's inclinations is generally known at fourteen or fifteen, and &s;eldom &s;ooner. Now if he incline to commerce&mdash;to a military&mdash;or a naval life&mdash;or to a mechanical employment, in all of which it is agreed, Latin and Greek are unnece&s;&s;ary, it will be improper to detain him any longer at &s;chool, by which means much money will be &s;aved by the parents, and much time &s;aved by the boy, both of which are wa&s;ted by the pre&s;ent indi&s;criminate and prepo&s;terous mode of teaching the dead languages.</P>
<P>The idea of the nece&s;&s;ity of a knowledge of tho&s;e languages, as an introduction to the knowledge of the Engli&s;h language, begins to lo&s;e ground. It is certainly a very ab&s;urd one. We have &s;everal Engli&s;h
<PB N="55" REF="034495_0061_0FFE01292EB46BC0">
&s;chools in our city, in which boys and girls of twelve and fourteen years old have been taught to &s;peak and write our native language with great grammatical pro|priety. Some of the&s;e children would di&s;grace our bachelors and ma&s;ters of arts, who have &s;pent four or five years in the &s;tudy of the Latin and Greek lan|guages in our American colleges. It is true, the&s;e Latin and Greek &s;cholars, after a while, acquire a knowledge of our language: but it is in the &s;ame &s;low way, in which &s;ome men acquire a knowledge of the forms of good breeding. Three months in&s;truction will often impart more of both, than a whole life &s;pent in acquiring them &s;imply by imitation.</P>
<P>Where there is one Latin &s;cholar, who is obliged, in the cour&s;e of his life, to <HI>&s;peak</HI> or <HI>write</HI> a Latin &s;entence, there are hundreds who are not under that nece&s;&s;ity. Why then &s;hould we &s;pend years in teach|ing that which is &s;o rarely required in future life? For &s;ome years to come, the reading of the language, may be nece&s;&s;ary; but a young man of fourteen or fifteen, may be taught to do this perfectly in one year, without committing a &s;ingle grammar rule to memory, or without <HI>&s;poiling his hand by</HI> writing a &s;in|gle ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Much more, in my opinion, might be &s;aid in favour of teaching our young men to <HI>&s;peak</HI> the Indian lan|guages of our country, than to <HI>&s;peak</HI> or write Latin. By their means, they might qualify them&s;elves to be|come amba&s;&s;adors to our Indian nations, or introduce
<PB N="56" REF="034495_0062_0FFE012AB8001AF8">
among them a knowledge of the ble&s;&s;ings of civilization and religion.</P>
<P>We have lately &s;een a large portion of power wre&s;ted from the hands of kings and prie&s;ts, and ex|erci&s;ed by its lawful owners. Is it not high time to wre&s;t the power over the education of our youth, out of the hands of ignorant or prejudiced &s;choolma&s;ters, and place it in the hands of men of more knowledge and experience in the affairs of the world? We talk much of our being an <HI>enlightened</HI> people; but I know not with what rea&s;on, while we tolerate a &s;y&s;tem of educa|tion in our &s;chools, which is as di&s;graceful to the human under&s;tanding as the mo&s;t corrupt tenets or practices of the pagan religion, or of the Turki&s;h go|vernment.</P>

<HEAD>THOUGHTS UPON THE AMUSEMENTS AND PUNISH|MENTS WHICH ARE PROPER FOR SCHOOLS. AD|DRESSED TO GEORGE CLYMER, ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE la&s;t time I had the plea&s;ure of being in your company, you did me the honour to re|que&s;t my opinion upon the AMUSEMENTS and PUNISH|MENTS which are proper for &s;chools The &s;ubjects are of a very oppo&s;ite nature, but I &s;hall endeavour to comply with your wi&s;hes, by &s;ending you a few thoughts upon each of them. I am &s;ure you will not reject my opinions becau&s;e they are contrary to received practices, for I know that you are accu&s;|tomed to think for your&s;elf, and that every propo|&s;ition that has for its objects the intere&s;ts of humanity and your country, will be treated by you with atten|tion and candor.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with the &s;ubjects of AMUSEMENTS. Monte&s;quieu informs us that the exerci&s;es of the la&s;t day of the life of Epaminondas, were the &s;ame as his amu&s;ements in his youth. Herein we have an epi|tome of the perfection of education. The amu&s;e|ments of Epaminondas were of a military nature; but as the profe&s;&s;ion of arms is the bu&s;ine&s;s of only a &s;mall part of mankind, and happily much le&s;s
<PB N="58" REF="034495_0064_0FFE0132AF9CA8E0">
nece&s;&s;ary in the United States than in ancient Greece, I would propo&s;e that the amu&s;ements of our youth, at &s;chool, &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch exerci&s;es as will be mo&s;t &s;ub&s;ervient to their future employments in life. The&s;e are; 1. agriculture; 2. mechanical occupations; and 3. the bu&s;ine&s;s of the learned pro|fe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P N="1">I. There is a variety in the employments of agri|culture which may readily be &s;uited to the genius, ta&s;te, and &s;trength of young people. An experiment has been made of the efficacy of the&s;e employments, as amu&s;ements, in the Methodi&s;t College at Abing|ton, in Maryland; and, I have been informed, with the happie&s;t effects. A large lot is divided between the &s;cholars, and premiums are adjudged to tho&s;e of them who produce the mo&s;t vegetables from their grounds, or who keep them in the be&s;t order.</P>
<P N="2">II. As the employments of agriculture cannot af|ford amu&s;ement at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, or in cities I would propo&s;e, that children &s;hould be allured to to &s;eek amu&s;ements in &s;uch of the mechanical arts as are &s;uited to their &s;trength and capacities. Where is the boy who does not delight in the u&s;e of a ham|mer&mdash;a chi&s;&s;el&mdash;or a &s;aw? and who has not enjoy|ed a high degree of plea&s;ure in his youth, in con|&s;tructing a miniature hou&s;e? How amu&s;ing are the machines which are employed in the manufactory of cloathing of all kinds! and how full of various en|tertainment
<PB N="59" REF="034495_0065_0FFE013439CD2268">
are the mixtures which take place in the chemical arts! each of the&s;e might be contrived upon &s;uch a &s;cale, as not only to amu&s;e young people, but to afford a profit to their parents or ma&s;ters. The Moravians, at Bethlehem in our &s;tate, have proved that this propo&s;ition is not a chimerical one. All the amu&s;ements of their children are derived from their performing the &s;ubordinate parts of &s;everal of the mechanical arts; and a con&s;iderable portion of the wealth of that worthy and happy &s;ociety is the pro|duct of the labour of their little hands.&mdash;</P>
<P>If, in the&s;e amu&s;ements, an appeal &s;hould be made to that &s;pirit of competition which is &s;o com|mon among young people, it would be the means of producing more plea&s;ure to the children, and more profit to all who are connected with them. The wealth of tho&s;e manufacturing towns in England, which employ the children of poor people, is a proof of what might be expected from connecting amu&s;e|ment&punc; and labour together, in all our &s;chools. The product from the labour obtained in this way, from all the &s;chools in the United States, would amount to a &s;um which would almo&s;t exceed calculation.</P>
<P N="3">III. To train the youth who are intended for the learned profe&s;&s;ions or for merchandize, to the duties of their future employments, by means of u&s;eful amu&s;ements, which are <HI>related</HI> to tho&s;e employments, will be impracticable; but their amu&s;ements may be
<PB N="60" REF="034495_0066_0FFE0135C80C3610">
derived from cultivating a &s;pot of ground; for where is the lawyer, the phy&s;ician, the divine, or the mer|chant, who has not indulged or felt a pa&s;&s;ion, in &s;ome part of his life, for rural improvements?&mdash;In|deed I conceive the &s;eeds of knowledge in agri|culture will be mo&s;t productive, when they are planted in the minds of this cla&s;s of &s;cholars.</P>
<P>I have only to add under this head, that the com|mon amu&s;ements of children have no connection with their future occupations. Many of them injure their cloaths, &s;ome of them wa&s;te their &s;trength, and impair their health, and all of them prove more or le&s;s, the means of producing noi&s;e, or of exciting angry pa&s;&s;ions, both of which are calculated to beget vulgar manners. The Methodi&s;ts have wi&s;ely bani&s;hed every &s;pecies of play from their college. Even the healthy and plea&s;urable exerci&s;e of &s;wimming, is not permitted to their &s;cholars, except in the pre&s;ence of one of their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Do not think me too &s;trict if I here exclude <HI>gunning</HI> from among the amu&s;ements of young men. My objections to it are as follow.</P>
<P N="1">1 It hardens the heart, by inflicting unnece&s;&s;ary pain and death upon animals.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is unnece&s;&s;ary in civilized &s;ociety, where animal food may be obtained from dome&s;tic animals, with greater facility.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="61" REF="034495_0067_0FFE013887BFDF18">3. It con&s;umes a great deal of time, and thus creates habits of idlene&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. It frequently leads young men into low, and bad company.</P>
<P N="5">5. By impo&s;ing long ab&s;tinence from food, it leads to intemperance in eating, which naturally leads to in|temperance in drinking.</P>
<P N="6">6. It expo&s;es to fevers, and accidents. The news|papers are occa&s;ionally filled with melancholy accounts of the latter, and every phy&s;ician mu&s;t have met with frequent and dangerous in&s;tances of the former, in the cour&s;e of his practice.</P>
<P>I know the early u&s;e of a gun is recommended in our country, to teach our young men the u&s;e of fire|arms, and thereby to prepare them for war and battle. But why &s;hould we in&s;pire our youth, by &s;uch exer|ci&s;es, with ho&s;tile ideas towards their fellow crea|tures?&mdash;Let us rather in&s;till into their minds &s;enti|ments of univer&s;al benevolenee to men of all nations and colours. Wars originate in error and vice. Let us eradicate the&s;e, by proper modes of education, and wars will cea&s;e to be nece&s;&s;ary in our country. The divine author and lover of peace
<Q>will then &s;uffer no man to do us wrong; yea, he will re|prove kings for our &s;ake, &s;aying, touch not my anointed and do my people no harm.</Q>

congenial to their malignant di&s;po&s;itions; for the flames of war can be &s;pread from one nation to ano|ther, only by the conducting mediums of vice and error.</P>
<P>I have hinted at the injury which is done to the health of young people by &s;ome of their amu&s;ements; but there is a practice common in all our &s;chools, which does more harm to their bodies than all the amu&s;ements that can be named, and that is, obliging them to &s;it too long in <HI>one place,</HI> or crowding too many of them together <HI>in one room.</HI> By means of the former, the growth and &s;hape of the body have been impaired; and by means of the latter, the &s;eeds of fevers have often been engendered in &s;chools. In the cour&s;e of my bu&s;ine&s;s, I have been called to many hundred children who have been &s;eized with indi&s;po|&s;itions in &s;chool, which evidently aro&s;e from the ac|tion of morbid effluvia, produced by the confined breath and per&s;piration of too great a number of children in one room. To obviate the&s;e evils, chil|dren &s;hould be permitted, after they have &s;aid their le&s;&s;ons, to amu&s;e them&s;elves in the open air, in &s;ome of the u&s;eful and agreeable exerci&s;es which have been mentioned. Their minds will be &s;trengthened, as well as their bodies relieved by them. To oblige a &s;prightly boy to &s;it <HI>&s;even</HI> hours in a day, with his
<PB N="63" REF="034495_0069_0FFE013F426A2DE8">
little arms pinioned to his &s;ides, and his neck unna|turally bent towards his book; and for <HI>no crime!</HI>&mdash; what cruelty and folly are manife&s;ted, by &s;uch an ab|&s;urd mode of in&s;tructing or governing young peo|ple!</P>
<P>I come next to &s;ay a few words upon the &s;ub|ject of PUNISHMENTS which are proper in &s;chools.</P>
<P>In barbarous ages every thing partook of the com|plexion of the times. Civil, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, military, and dome&s;tic puni&s;hments were all of a cruel nature. With the progre&s;s of rea&s;on and chri&s;tianity, puni&s;h|ments of all kinds have become le&s;s &s;evere. Soli|tude and labour are now &s;ub&s;tituted in many countries, with &s;ucce&s;s, in the room of the whipping-po&s;t and the gallows.&mdash;The innocent infirmities of human nature are no longer pro&s;cribed, and puni&s;hed by the church. Di&s;cipline, con&s;i&s;ting in the vigilance of officers, has le&s;&s;ened the &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity of military executions; and hu&s;bands&mdash;fathers&mdash;and ma&s;ters now blu&s;h at the hi&s;tory of the times, when wives, chil|dren, and &s;ervants, were governed only by force. But unfortunately this &s;pirit of humanity and civilization has not reached our &s;chools. The rod is yet the principal in&s;trument of governing them, and a &s;chool-ma&s;ter remains the only de&s;pot now known in free countries. Perhaps it is becau&s;e the little &s;ubjects of their arbitrary and capricious power have not been in a condition to complain. I &s;hall endeavour there|fore
<PB N="64" REF="034495_0070_0FFE0140CAA45D80">
to plead their cau&s;e, and to prove that corpo|ral puni&s;hments (except to children under four or five years of age) are never nece&s;&s;ary, and always hurtful, in &s;chools.&mdash;The following arguments I hope will be &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h this propo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="1">1. Children are &s;eldom &s;ent to &s;chool before they are capable of feeling the force of rational or moral obligation. They may therefore be deterred from committing offences, by motives le&s;s di&s;graceful than the fear of corporal puni&s;hments.</P>
<P N="2">2. By correcting children for ignorance and negli|gence in &s;chool, their ideas of <HI>improper</HI> and <HI>immoral</HI> actions are confounded, and hence the moral faculty becomes weakened in after life. It would not be more cruel or ab&s;urd to inflict the puni&s;hment of the whipping-po&s;t upon a man, for not dre&s;&s;ing fa&s;hionably or neatly, than it is to ferule a boy for blotting his copy book, or mi&s;-&s;pelling a word.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the natural affection of a parent is &s;ometimes in&s;ufficient, to re&s;train the violent effects of a &s;udden gu&s;t of anger upon a child, how dangerous mu&s;t the power of correcting children be when lodged in the hands of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, in who&s;e anger there is no mixture of parental affection! Perhaps tho&s;e parents act mo&s;t wi&s;ely, who never tru&s;t them&s;elves to inflict corporal puni&s;hments upon their children, after they are four or five years old, but endeavour to puni&s;h, and
<PB N="65" REF="034495_0071_0FFE0143923721B8">
reclaim them, by confinement, or by abridging them of &s;ome of their u&s;ual gratifications, in dre&s;s, food or amu&s;ements.</P>
<P N="4">4. Injuries are &s;ometimes done to the bodies, and &s;ometimes to the intellects of children, by cor|poral puni&s;hments. I recollect, when a boy, to have lo&s;t a &s;chool-mate, who was &s;aid to have died in con&s;equence of a &s;evere whipping he received in &s;chool. At that time I did not believe it po&s;&s;ible, but from what I now know of the di&s;proportion between the vio|lent emotions of the mind, and the &s;trength of the body in children, I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that not only &s;ickne&s;s, but that even <HI>death</HI> may be induced, by the convul&s;ions of a youthful mind, worked up to a high &s;en&s;e of &s;hame and re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The effects of thumping the head, boxing the ears, and pulling the hair, in impairing the intellects, by means of injuries done to the brain, are too obvious to be mentioned.</P>
<P N="5">5. Where there is <HI>&s;hame,</HI> &s;ays Dr. John&s;on, there may be <HI>virtue.</HI> But corporal puni&s;hments, inflicted at &s;chool, have a tendency to de&s;troy the &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, and thereby to de&s;troy all moral &s;en&s;ibility. The boy that has been often publicly whipped at &s;chool, is under great obligations to his maker, and his parents, if he afterwards e&s;cape the whipping-po&s;t or the gal|lows.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="66" REF="034495_0072_0FFE0148CAF63E70">6. Corporal puni&s;hments, inflicted at &s;chool, tend to beget a &s;pirit of violence in boys towards each other, which often follows them through life; but they more certainly beget a &s;pirit of hatred, or revenge, towards their ma&s;ters, which too often becomes a ferment of the &s;ame baneful pa&s;&s;ions towards other people. The celebrated Dr. afterwards Baron Haller declared, that he never &s;aw, without horror, during the remain|ing part of his life, a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, who had treat|ed him with unmerited &s;everity, when he was only ten years old. A &s;imilar anecdote is related of the famous M. de Condamine. I think I have known &s;everal in&s;tances of this vindictive, or indignant &s;pirit, to continue towards a cruel and tyrannical &s;chool-ma&s;ter, in per&s;ons who were advanced in life, and who were otherwi&s;e of gentle and forgiving di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P N="7">7. Corporal puni&s;hments, inflicted at &s;chools, beget a hatred to in&s;truction in young people. I have &s;ome|times &s;u&s;pected that the Devil, who knows how great an enemy knowledge is to his kingdom, has had the addre&s;s to make the world believe that <HI>ferruling, pulling</HI> and <HI>boxing ears, cudgelling, hor&s;ing,</HI> &amp;c. and, in boarding-&s;chools, a <HI>little &s;tarving,</HI> are all ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the government of young people, on purpo&s;e that he might make both &s;chools, and &s;chool-ma&s;ters odious, and thereby keep our world in ignorance; for ignorance is the be&s;t means the Devil ever contrived, to keep up the number of his &s;ubjects in our world.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="67" REF="034495_0073_0FFE014A5382DF80">8. Corporal puni&s;hments are not only hurtful, but altogether unnece&s;&s;ary, in &s;chools. Some of the mo&s;t celebrated and &s;uccesful &s;chool-ma&s;ters, that I have known, never made u&s;e of them.</P>
<P N="9">9. The fear of corporal puni&s;hments, by debilitating the body, produces a corre&s;ponding debility in the mind, which contracts its capacity of acquiring know|ledge. This capacity is enlarged by the tone which the mind acquires from the action of hope, love, and confidence upon it; and all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions might ea&s;i|ly be cheri&s;hed, by a prudent and enlightened &s;chool-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P N="10">10. As there &s;hould always be a certain ratio be|tween the &s;trength of a remedy, and the excitability of the body in di&s;ea&s;es, &s;o there &s;hould be a &s;imilar ratio between the force employed in the government of a &s;chool, and the capacites and tempers of children. A kind rebuke, like fre&s;h air in a fainting fit, is calcu|lated to act upon a young mind with more effect, than &s;timulants of the greate&s;t power; but corporal puni&s;h|ments level all capacities and tempers, as quack-me|dicines do, all con&s;titutions and di&s;ea&s;es. They di&s;honour and degrade our &s;pecies; for they &s;uppo&s;e a total ab&s;ence of all moral and intellectual feeling from the mind. Have we not often &s;een dull children &s;ud|denly improve, by changing their &s;chools? The rea&s;on is obvious. The &s;uccesful teacher only accommodated his manner and di&s;cipline to the capacities of his &s;cholars.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="68" REF="034495_0074_0FFE014BDD4B1988">11. I conceive corporal puni&s;hments, inflicted in an arbitrary manner, to be contrary to the &s;pirit of liberty, and that they &s;hould not be tolerated in a free government. Why &s;hould not children be protected from violence and injuries, as well as white and black &s;ervants?&mdash;Had I influence enough in our legi&s;lature to obtain only a &s;ingle law, it &s;hould be to make the puni&s;hment for &s;triking a &s;chool boy, the &s;ame as for a&s;&s;aulting and beating an adult member of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e arguments I know &s;ome well di&s;po&s;ed people will reply, that the <HI>rod</HI> has received a divine commi&s;&s;ion from the &s;acred Scriptures, as the in&s;tru|ment of correcting children. To this I an&s;wer that the <HI>rod,</HI> in the Old Te&s;tament, by a very common figure in Rhetoric, &s;tands for puni&s;hments of <HI>any</HI> kind, ju&s;t as the <HI>&s;word,</HI> in the New Te&s;tament, &s;tands for the faithful and general admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in &s;uch a way as is mo&s;t calculated to reform criminals, and to prevent crimes</P>
<P>The following method of governing a &s;chool, I apprehend, would be attended with much better ef|fects, than that which I have endeavoured to &s;hew to be contrary to rea&s;on, humanity, religion, liberty, and the experience of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t teachers in the world.</P>
<P>Let a &s;chool-ma&s;ter endeavour, in the fir&s;t place, to acquire the confidence of his &s;cholars, by a prudent deportment. Let him learn to command his pa&s;&s;ions
<PB N="69" REF="034495_0075_0FFE014E9F2C4538">
and temper, at all times, in his &s;chool,&mdash;Let him treat the name of the Supreme Being with reverence, as often as it occurs in books, or in conver&s;ation with his &s;cholars.&mdash;Let him exact a re&s;pectful behaviour towards him&s;elf, in his &s;chool; but in the intervals of &s;chool hours, let him treat his &s;cholars with gentlene&s;s and familiarity. If he &s;hould even join in their amu&s;e|ments, he would not loo&s;e, by his conde&s;cen&s;ion, any part of his authority over them. But to &s;ecure their affection and re&s;pect more perfectly, let him, once or twice a year, lay out a &s;mall &s;um of money in pen|knives, and books, and di&s;tribute them among his &s;cho|lars, as rewards for proficiency in learning, and for good behaviour. If the&s;e prudent and popular mea&s;ures &s;hould fail of preventing offences at &s;chool, then let the following modes of puni&s;hment be adopted.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Private</HI> admonition. By this mode of rebuking, we imitate the conduct of the divine Being towards his offending creatures, for his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> puni&s;hment is always inflicted <HI>privately,</HI> by means of the <HI>&s;till</HI> voice of con|&s;cience.</P>
<P N="2">2. Confinement after &s;chool-hours are ended; but with the knowledge of the parents of the children.</P>
<P N="3">3. Holding a &s;mall &s;ign of di&s;grace, of any kind, in the middle of the floor, in the pre&s;ence of a whole &s;chool.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="034495_0076_0FFE0153D04C0710">If the&s;e puni&s;hments fail of reclaiming a bad boy, he &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from &s;chool, to prevent his cor|rupting his &s;chool-mates. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of parents, and not of &s;chool-ma&s;ters, to u&s;e the la&s;t means for eradicating idlene&s;s and vice from their children.</P>
<P>The world was created in love. It is &s;u&s;tained by love. Nations and families that are happy, are made &s;o only by love. Let us extend this divine principle, to tho&s;e little communities which we call &s;chools. Children are capable of loving in a high degree. They may therefore be governed by love.</P>
<P>The occupation of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter is truly dignified. He is, next to mothers, the mo&s;t important member of civil &s;ociety. Why then is there &s;o little rank con|nected with that occupation? Why do we treat it with &s;o much neglect or contempt? It is becau&s;e the voice of rea&s;on, in the human heart, a&s;&s;ociates with it the idea of de&s;poti&s;m and violence. Let &s;chool-ma&s;ters cea&s;e to be tyrants, and they will &s;oon enjoy the re&s;pect and rank, which are naturally connected with their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We are gro&s;ly mi&s;taken in looking up wholly to our governments, and even to mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, to pro|mote public and private order in &s;ociety. Mothers and &s;chool-ma&s;ters plant the &s;eeds of nearly all the good and evil which exi&s;t in our world. Its reformation mu&s;t therefore be begun in nur&s;eries and in &s;chools. If the habits we acquire there, were to have no influence
<PB N="71" REF="034495_0077_0FFE0155582584C0">
upon our future happine&s;s, yet the influence they have upon our governments, is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why we ought to introduce new modes, as well as new objects of education into our country.</P>
<P>You have lately been employed in an attempt to perpetuate our exi&s;tence as a free people, by e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the means of national credit and defence; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Clymer was one of the Repre&s;entatives of Penn&s;ylvania, in the fir&s;t Congre&s;s of the United States which met in New York, in the year 1789.</NOTE> but the&s;e are feeble bulwarks again&s;t &s;lavery, compared with habits of labour and virtue, di&s;&s;eminated among our young people. Let us e&s;tabli&s;h &s;chools for this purpo&s;e, in every town&s;hip in the United States, and conform them to rea&s;on, humanity, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety in America. Then, Sir, will the generations who are to follow us, realize the precious ideas of the dignity and excellence of republican forms of government, which I well recollect you cheri&s;hed with &s;o much ardor, in the beginning of the American revolution, and which you have manife&s;ted ever &s;ince, both by your public and private conduct.</P>
<P>We &s;uffer &s;o much from traditional error of various kinds, in education, morals, and government, that I have been led to wi&s;h, that it were po&s;&s;ible for us to have &s;chools e&s;tabli&s;hed, in the United States, for teaching <HI>the art of forgetting.</HI> I think three-fourths of all our &s;chool-ma&s;ters, divines, and legi&s;lators would
<PB N="72" REF="034495_0078_0FFE01581743A488">
profit very much, by &s;pending two or three years in &s;uch u&s;eful in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>An apology may &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary, not only for the length of this letter, but for &s;ome of the opinions contained in it. I know how apt mankind are to brand every propo&s;ition for innovation, as vi&s;ionary and Utopian. But good men &s;hould not be di&s;couraged, by &s;uch epithets, from their attempts to combat vice and error. There never was an improvement, in any art or &s;cience, nor even a propo&s;al for meliorating the condition of man, in any age or country, that has not been con&s;idered in the light of what has been called, &s;ince Sir. Thomas More's time, an <HI>Utopian &s;cheme.</HI> The application of the magnet to navigation, and of &s;team to mechanical purpo&s;es, have both been branded as Utopian projects. The great idea in the mind of Columbus, of exploring a new world, was long viewed, in mo&s;t of the courts of Europe, as the dream of a vi&s;ionary &s;ailor. But why do we go to ancient times, for proofs of important innovations in human affairs having been treated as Utopian &s;chemes. You and I recollect the time, when the abolition of negro &s;lavery in our &s;tate, as al&s;o when the independence of the United States, and the pre&s;ent wi&s;e and happy confed|eracy of our republics, were all con&s;idered by many of our &s;ober prudent men, as &s;ubjects of an Utopian nature.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="034495_0079_0FFE015AEC504CA0">If tho&s;e benefactors of mankind, who have levelled mountains in the great road of human life, by the di&s;coveries or labours which have been mentioned, have been &s;tigmatized with obloquy, as vi&s;ionary projectors, why &s;hould an individual be afraid of &s;imilar treatment, who has only attempted to give to that road, from its beginning, a &s;traight direction.</P>

<HEAD>THOUGHTS UPON FEMALE EDUCATION, ACCOMMODAT|ED TO THE PRESENT STATE OF SOCIETY, MANNERS, AND GOVERNMENT, IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ADDRESSED TO THE VISITORS OF THE YOUNG LADIES' ACADEMY IN PHILADELPHIA, 28th JULY, 1787, AT THE CLOSE OF THE QUARTERLY EXAMINATION, AND AFTERWARDS PUBLISHED AT THE REQUEST OF THE VISITORS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE yielded with diffidence to the &s;olicita|tions of the Principal of the Academy, in undertaking to expre&s;s my regard for the pro&s;perity of this &s;eminary of learning, by &s;ubmitting to your candor, a few Thoughts upon Female Education.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t remark that I &s;hall make upon this &s;ubject, is, that female education &s;hould be accommodated to the &s;tate of &s;ociety, manners, and government of the coun|try, in which it is conducted.</P>
<P>This remark leads me at once to add,, that the educati|on of young ladies, in this country, &s;hould be conducted upon principles very different from what it is in Great Britain, and in &s;ome re&s;pects, different from what it was when we were part of a monarchical empire.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal circum&s;tances in the &s;ituation, em|ployments, and duties of women in America, which require a peculiar mode of education.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="76" REF="034495_0082_0FFE0164635A4EE8">I. The early marriages of our women, by contracting the time allowed for education, renders it nece&s;&s;ary to contract its plan, and to confine it chiefly to the more u&s;eful branches of literature.</P>
<P N="2">II. The &s;tate of property in America, renders it nece&s;&s;ary for the greate&s;t part of our citizens to employ them&s;elves, in different occupations, for the advance|ment of their fortunes. This cannot be done without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the female members of the community. They mu&s;t be the &s;tewards, and guardians of their hu&s;bands' property. That education, therefore, will be mo&s;t proper for our women, which teaches them to di&s;charge the duties of tho&s;e offices with the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s and reputation.</P>
<P N="3">III. From the numerous avocations from their families, to which profe&s;&s;ional life expo&s;es gentlemen in America, a principal &s;hare of the in&s;truction of children naturally devolves upon the women. It be|comes us therefore to prepare them by a &s;uitable education, for the di&s;charge of this mo&s;t important duty of mothers.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The equal &s;hare that every citizen has in the liberty, and the po&s;&s;ible &s;hare he may have in the government of our country, make it nece&s;&s;ary that our ladies &s;hould be qualified to a certain degree by a pecu|liar
<PB N="77" REF="034495_0083_0FFE0165EBDB7290">
and &s;uitable education, to concur in in&s;tructing their &s;ons in the principles of liberty and government.</P>
<P N="5">V. In Great Britain the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ervants is a regular occupation; but in America this humble &s;tation is the u&s;ual retreat of unexpected indigence; hence the &s;ervants in this country po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s knowledge and &s;ubordination than are required from them; and hence, our ladies are obliged to attend more to the private af|fairs of their families, than ladies generally do, of the &s;ame rank in Great Britain. "They are good &s;ervants," &s;aid an American lady of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Graeme.</NOTE> in a letter to a favorite daughter, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Elizabeth Fergu&s;on.</NOTE>
<Q>who will do well with good looking after.</Q>
This circum&s;tance &s;hould have great influence upon the nature and extent of female education in America.</P>
<P>The branches of literature mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential for a young lady in this country, appear to be,</P>
<P N="1">I. A knowledge of the Engli&s;h language. She &s;hould not only read, but &s;peak and &s;pell it correctly. And to enable her to do this, &s;he &s;hould be taught the Engli&s;h grammar, and be frequently examined in applying its rules in common conver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="2">II. Plea&s;ure and intere&s;t con&s;pire to make the writing of a fair and legible hand, a nece&s;&s;ary branch of a lady's education. For this purpo&s;e &s;he &s;hould be
<PB N="78" REF="034495_0084_0FFE0168AD678CE8">

<P N="5">V. Vocal mu&s;ic &s;hould never be neglected, in the education of a young lady, in this country. Be&s;ides preparing her to join in that part of public wor&s;hip which con&s;i&s;ts in p&s;almody, it will enable her to &s;oothe the cares of dome&s;tic life.

<P N="6"><PB N="81" REF="034495_0087_0FFE01700E88E6C8">VI. DANCING is by no means an improper branch of education for an American lady. It promotes health, and renders the figure and motions of the body ea&s;y and agreeable. I anticipate the time when the re&s;ources of conver&s;ation &s;hall be &s;o far multiplied, that the amu&s;ement of dancing &s;hall be wholly con|fined to children.

<P N="7">VII. The attention of our young ladies &s;hould be directed, as &s;oon as they are prepared for it, to the reading of hi&s;tory&mdash;travels&mdash;poetry&mdash;and moral e&s;&s;ays.

They hold up <HI>life,</HI> it is true, but it is not as yet <HI>life</HI> in America. Our pa&s;&s;ions have not as yet "over&s;tepped the mode&s;ty of nature." nor are they "to<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">o tatters," to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ions of the poet, by extravagant love, jealou&s;y, ambition, or revenge. As yet the intrigues of a Briti&s;h novel, are as foreign to our manners, as the refinements of A&s;iatic vice. Let it not be &s;aid, that the tales of di&s;|tre&s;s,
<PB N="82" REF="034495_0088_0FFE027544916348">
which fill modern novels, have a tendency to &s;often the female heart into acts of humanity. The fact is the rever&s;e of this. The abortive &s;ympathy which is excited by the recital of imaginary di&s;tre&s;s, blunts the heart to that which is real; and, hence, we &s;ometimes &s;ee in&s;tances of young ladies, who weep away a whole forenoon over the criminal &s;orrows of a fictitious Charlotte or Werter, turning with di&s;dain at three o'clock from the &s;ight of a beggar, who &s;o|licits in feeble accents or &s;igns, a &s;mall portion only of the crumbs which fall from their fathers' tables.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. It will be nece&s;&s;ary to connect all the&s;e branches of education with regular in&s;truction in the chri&s;tian religion. For this purpo&s;e the principles of the different &s;ects of chri&s;tians &s;hould be taught and explained, and our pupils &s;hould early be furni&s;hed with &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;imple arguments in favour of the truth of chri&s;tianity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Baron Haller's letters to his daughter on the truths of the chri&s;tian religion, and Dr. Beatie's

A portion of the bible (of late improperly bani&s;hed from our &s;chools) &s;hould be read by them every day, and &s;uch que&s;tions &s;hould be a&s;ked, after reading it as are calculated to imprint upon their minds the intere&s;ting &s;tories contained in it.</P>

<PB N="83" REF="034495_0089_0FFDC64976E4BFE8">
There is &s;ome truth in this ob&s;ervation. I believe that we often impair their health, and weaken their capcities, by impo&s;ing &s;tudies upon them, which are not proportioned to their years. But this objec|tion does not apply to religious in&s;truction. There are certain &s;imple propo&s;itions in the chri&s;tian religion, which are &s;uited in a peculiar manner, to the infant &s;tate of rea&s;on and moral &s;en&s;ibility. A clergyman of long experience in the in&s;truction of youth <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. NICHOLAS COLLIN, mini&s;ter of the Swedi&s;h church in Wicocoo.</NOTE> in|formed me, that he always found children acquired religious knowledge more ea&s;ily than knowledge upon other &s;ubjects; and that young girls acquired this kind of knowledge more readily than boys. The female brea&s;t is the natural &s;oil of chri&s;tianity; and while our women are taught to believe its doctrines, and obey its precepts, the wit of Voltaire, and the &s;tile of Boling|broke, will never be able to de&s;troy its influence upon our citizens.</P>
<P>I cannot help remarking in this place, that chri&s;|tianity exerts the mo&s;t friendly influence upon &s;cience, as well as upon the morals and manners of mankind. Whether this be occa&s;ioned by the unity of truth, and the mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance which truths upon different &s;ubjects afford each other, or whether the faculties of the mind be &s;harpened and corrected by embracing the truths of revelation, and thereby prepared to in|ve&s;tigate and perceive truths upon other &s;ubjects, I
<PB N="84" REF="034495_0090_0FFE0172F6326B90">
will not determine, but I believe that the greate&s;t di&s;coveries in &s;cience have been made by chri&s;tian philo&s;ophers, and that there is the mo&s;t knowledge in tho&s;e countries where there is the mo&s;t chri&s;tianity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is true in a peculiar manner in the &s;cience of medecine.

<P N="9">IX. If the mea&s;ures that have been recommended for in&s;piring our pupils with a &s;en&s;e of religious and moral obligation be adopted, the government of them will be ea&s;y and agreeable.

<P>I have &s;aid nothing in favour of in&s;trumental mu&s;ic as a branch of female education, becau&s;e I conceive
<PB N="85" REF="034495_0091_0FFE0176F1400840">
it is by no means accommodated to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety and manners in America. The price of mu&s;ical in&s;truments, and the extravagant fees de|manded by the teachers of in&s;trumental mu&s;ic, form but a &s;mall part of my objections to it.</P>
<P>To perform well, upon a mu&s;ical in&s;trument, re|quires much time and long practice.

How many u&s;eful ideas might be picked up in the&s;e hours from hi&s;tory, philo&s;ophy, poetry, and the numerous moral e&s;&s;ays with which our language abounds, and how much more would the knowledge acquired upon the&s;e &s;ubjects add to the con&s;equence of a lady, with her hu&s;band and with &s;ociety, than the be&s;t performed pieces of mu&s;ic upon a harp&s;icord or a guittar!

He might with more propriety have &s;aid, let the ladies of a country be educated properly, and they will not only make and admini&s;ter its laws, but form its manners and character. It would require a lively imaginaiton to de&s;cribe, or even to comprehend, the

happine&s;s of a country, where knowledge and virtue, were generally diffu&s;ed among the female &s;ex. Our young men would then be re&s;trained from vice by the terror of being bani&s;hed from their company. The loud laugh, and the malignant &s;mile, at the expence of innocence, or of per&s;onal infirmities&mdash;the feats of &s;ucce&s;sful mimickry&mdash;and the low priced wit, which is borrowed from a mi&s;application of &s;cripture phra&s;es, would no more be con&s;idered as recommendations to the &s;ociety of the ladies. A double entendre in their pre&s;ence, would then exclude a gentleman forever from the company of both &s;exes, and probably oblige him to &s;eek an a&s;ylum from contempt, in a foreign country. The influence of female education would be &s;till more exten&s;ive and u&s;eful in dome&s;tic life. The obligations of gentlemen to qualify them&s;elves by knowledge and indu&s;try to di&s;charge the duties of benevolence, would be encrea&s;ed by marriage; and the patriot&mdash;the hero&mdash;and the legi&s;lator, would find the &s;weete&s;t reward of their toils, in the approba|tion and applau&s;e of their wives.

<HEAD>A DEFENCE OF THE USE OF THE BIBLE AS A SCHOOL BOOK. ADDRESSED TO THE REV. JEREMY BELKNAP, OF BOSTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now &s;everal months, &s;ince I promi&s;ed to give you my rea&s;ons for preferring the bible as a &s;chool book, to all other compo&s;itions. I &s;hall not trouble you with an apology for my delaying &s;o long to comply with my promi&s;e, but &s;hall proceed im|mediately to the &s;ubject of my letter.</P>
<P>Before I &s;tate my arguments in favour of teach|ing children to read by means of the bible, I &s;hall a&s;&s;ume the five following propo&s;itions.</P>
<P N="1">I. That chri&s;tianity is the only true and perfect religion, and that in proportion as mankind adopt its principles, and obey its precepts, they will be wi&s;e, and happy.</P>
<P N="2">II. That a better knowledge of this religion is to be acquired by reading the bible, than in any other way.</P>
<P N="3">III That the bible contains more knowledge nece&s;|&s;ary to man in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, than any other book in the world.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="94" REF="034495_0100_0FFE018F79115830">IV. That knowledge is mo&s;t durable, and religious in&s;truction mo&s;t u&s;eful, when imparted in early life,</P>
<P N="5">V. That the bible, when not read in &s;chools, is &s;eldom read in any &s;ub&s;equent period of life.</P>
<P>My arguments in favor of the u&s;e of the bible as a &s;chool book are founded, I. In the con&s;titution of the human mind.</P>
<P N="1">1. The memory is the fir&s;t faculty which opens in the minds of children. Of how much con&s;equence, then, mu&s;t it be, to impre&s;s it with the great truths of chri&s;tianity, before it is pre-occupied with le&s;s intere&s;t|ing &s;ubjects! As all the liquors, which are poured into a cup, generally ta&s;te of that which fir&s;t filled it, &s;o all the knowledge, which is added to that which is trea&s;ured up in the memory from the bible, generally receives an agreeable and u&s;eful tincture from it.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a peculiar aptitude in the minds of chil|dren for religious knowledge. I have con&s;tantly found them in the fir&s;t &s;ix or &s;even years of their lives, more inqui&s;itive upon religious &s;ubjects, than upon any others: and an ingenious in&s;tructor of youth has informed me, that he has found young children more capable of receiving ju&s;t ideas upon the mo&s;t difficult tenets of religion, than upon the mo&s;t &s;imple branches of human knowledge. It would be &s;trange if it were otherwi&s;e; for God creates all his means to &s;uit all his ends. There mu&s;t of cour&s;e be a fitne&s;s between the
<PB N="95" REF="034495_0101_0FFE0193758B9C70">
human mind, and the truths which are e&s;&s;ential to its happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. The influence of <HI>prejudice</HI> is derived from the im|pre&s;&s;ions, which are made upon the mind in early life; prejudices are of two kinds, true and fal&s;e. In a world where <HI>fal&s;e</HI> prejudices do &s;o much mi&s;chief, it would di&s;cover great weakne&s;s not to oppo&s;e them, by &s;uch as are <HI>true.</HI></P>
<P>I grant that many men have rejected the prejudices derived from the bible: but I believe no man ever did &s;o, without having been made <HI>wi&s;er</HI> or <HI>better,</HI> by the early operation of the&s;e prejudices upon his mind. Every ju&s;t principle that is to be found in the writings of Voltaire, is borrowed from the Bible: and the mo|rality of the Dei&s;ts, which has been &s;o much admired and prai&s;ed, is, I believe, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, the effect of habits, produced by early in&s;truction in the principles of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P N="4">4. We are &s;ubject, by a general law in our natures, to what is called <HI>habit.</HI> Now if the &s;tudy of the &s;crip|tures be nece&s;&s;ary to our happine&s;s at any time of our lives, the &s;ooner we begin to read them, the more we &s;hall be attached to them; for it is peculiar to all the acts of habit, to become ea&s;y, &s;trong and agreeable by repetition.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is a law in our natures, that we remember <HI>longe&s;t</HI> the knowledge we acquire by the greate&s;t number
<PB N="96" REF="034495_0102_0FFE019507426DD0">
of our &s;en&s;es. Now a knowledge of the contents of the bible, is acquired in &s;chool by the aid of the <HI>eyes</HI> and the <HI>ears</HI>; for children after getting their le&s;&s;ons, always &s;ay them to their ma&s;ters in an audible voice; of cour&s;e there is a pre&s;umption, that this knowledge will be retained much longer than if it had been acquir|ed in any other way.</P>
<P N="6">6. The intere&s;ting events and characters, recorded and de&s;cribed in the Old and New Te&s;taments, are accomodated above all others to &s;eize upon all the faculties of the minds of children. The under&s;tand|ing, the memory, the imagination, the pa&s;&s;ions, and the moral powers, are all occa&s;ionally addre&s;&s;ed by the various incidents which are contained in tho&s;e divine books, in&s;omuch that not to be delighted with them, is to be devoid of every principle of plea&s;ure that exi&s;ts in a &s;ound mind.</P>
<P N="7">7. There is a native love of <HI>truth</HI> in the human mind. Lord Shafte&s;bury &s;ays, that
<Q>truth is &s;o con|genial to our minds, that we love ever the <HI>&s;hadow</HI> of it:</Q>
and Horace, in his rules for compo&s;ing an epick poem, e&s;tabli&s;hes the &s;ame law in our natures, by advi&s;ing the "fictions in poetry to re&s;emble truth." Now the bible contains more truths than any other book in the world: &s;o true is the te&s;timony that it bears of God in his works of creation, providence, and redemption, that it is called <HI>truth</HI> it&s;elf, by way of pre|eminence above things that are only &s;imply true. How
<PB N="97" REF="034495_0103_0FFE01990568F2E0">
forcibly are we &s;truck with the evidences of truth, in the hi&s;tory of the Jews, above what we di&s;cover in the hi&s;tory of other nations? Where do we find a hero, or an hi&s;torian record his own faults or vices except in the Old Te&s;tament? Indeed, my friend, from &s;ome accounts which I have read of the American revolution, I begin to grow &s;ceptical to all hi&s;tory except to that which is contained in the bible. Now if this book be known to contain nothing but what is materially true, the mind will naturally acquire a love for it from this circum&s;tance: and from this affection for the truths of of the bible, it will acquire a di&s;cernment of truth in other books, and a preference of it in all the tran&s;actions of life.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. There is a wonderful property in the <HI>memory,</HI> which enables it in old age, to <HI>recover</HI> the knowledge it had acquired in early life, after it had been appa|rently forgotten for forty or fifty years. Of how much con&s;equence, then, mu&s;t it be, to fill the mind with that &s;pecies of knowledge, in childhood and youth, which, when <HI>recalled</HI> in the decline of life, will &s;upport the &s;oul under the infirmities of age, and &s;mooth the avenues of approaching death? The bible is the only book which is capable of affording this &s;upport to old age; and it is for this rea&s;on that we find it re&s;orted to with &s;o much diligence and plea&s;ure by &s;uch old people as have read it in early life. I can recollect many in&s;tances of this kind in per&s;ons who di&s;covered
<PB N="98" REF="034495_0104_0FFE019C01847550">
no attachment to the bible, in the meridian of their lives, who have notwith&s;tanding, &s;pent the evening of them, in reading no other book. The late Sir John Pringle, Phy&s;ician to the Queen of Great Britain, after pa&s;&s;ing a long life in camps and at court, clo&s;ed it by &s;tudying the &s;criptures. So anxious was he to increa&s;e his knowledge in them, that he wrote to Dr. Michaelis, a learned profe&s;&s;er of divinity in Germany, for an explanation of a difficult text of &s;cripture, a &s;hort time before his death.</P>
<P N="9">IX. My &s;econd argument in favour of the u&s;e of the bible in &s;chools, is founded upon an implied command of God, and upon the practice of &s;everal of the wi&s;e&s;t nations of the world.&mdash;In the 6th chapter of Deu|teronomy, we find the following words, which are directly to my purpo&s;e,
<Q>And thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy might. And the&s;e words which I command thee this day &s;hall be in thine heart. And thou <HI>&s;halt teach them diligently unto thy children,</HI> and &s;halt talk of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in thine hou&s;e, and when thou walke&s;t by the way, and when thou lie&s;t down, and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up.</Q></P>
<P>It appears, moreover, from the hi&s;tory of the Jews, that they flouri&s;hed as a nation, in proportion as they honoured and read the books of Mo&s;es, which contain|ed, a written revelation of the will of God, to the chil|dren
<PB N="99" REF="034495_0105_0FFE019D8EA47D48">
of men. The law was not only neglected, but lo&s;t during the general profligacy of manners which accom|panied the long and wicked reign of Mana&s;&s;ah. But the di&s;covery of it, in the rubbi&s;h of the temple, by Jo&s;iah, and its &s;ub&s;equent general u&s;e, were followed by a re|turn of national virtue and pro&s;perity. We read further, of the wonderful effects which the reading of the law by Ezra, after his return from his captiviy in Babylon, had upon the Jews. They hung upon his lips with tears, and &s;howed the &s;incerity of their re|pentance, by their general reformation.</P>
<P>The learning of the Jews, for many years con&s;i&s;ted in nothing but a knowledge of the &s;criptures. The&s;e were the text books of all the in&s;truction that was given in the &s;chools of their prophets. It was by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of this general knowledge of their law, that tho&s;e Jews that wandered from Judea into our coun|tries, carried with them and propagated certain ideas of the true God among all the civilized nations upon the face of the earth. And it was from the attachment they retained to the old Te&s;tament, that they procured a tran&s;lation of it into the Greek language, after they lo&s;t the Hebrew tongue, by their long ab&s;ence from their native country. The utility of this tran&s;lation, commonly called the &s;eptuagint, in facilitating the pro|gre&s;s of the go&s;pel, is well known to all who are ac|quainted with the hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t age of the chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="034495_0106_0FFE01A186C70028">But the benefits of an early and general acquaintance with the bible, were not confined only to the Jewi&s;h nations. They have appeared in many countries in Europe, &s;ince the reformation. The indu&s;try, and habits of order, which di&s;tingui&s;h many of the German nations, are derived from their early in&s;truction in the principles of chri&s;tianity, by means of the bible. The moral and enlightened character of the inhabitants of Scotland, and of the New England States, appears to be derived from the &s;ame cau&s;e. If we de&s;cend from nations to &s;ects, we &s;hall find them wi&s;e and pro&s;perous in proportion as they become early acquainted with the &s;criptures. The bible is &s;till u&s;ed as a &s;chool book among the quakers. The morality of this &s;ect of chri&s;tians is univer&s;ally acknowledged. Nor is this all, &mdash;their prudence in the management of their private affairs, is as much a mark of their &s;ociety, as their &s;ober manners.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to be excu&s;ed for repeating here, that if the bible did not convey a &s;ingle direction for the attain|ment of future happine&s;s, it &s;hould be read in our &s;chools in preference to all other books, from its containing the greate&s;t portion of that kind of knowledge which is cal|culated to produce private and publick temporal hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>We err not only in human affairs, but in religion likewi&s;e, <HI>only</HI> becau&s;e "we do not know the &s;criptures." The oppo&s;ite &s;y&s;tems of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ects of chri&s;tians
<PB N="101" REF="034495_0107_0FFE01A455088D50">
ari&s;e chiefly from their being more in&s;tructed in cate|chi&s;ms, creeds, and confe&s;&s;ions of faith, than in the &s;criptures. Immen&s;e truths, I believe, are concealed in them. The time, I have no doubt, will come, when po&s;terity will view and pity our ignorance of the&s;e truths, as much as we do the ignorance of the di&s;ciples of our Saviour, who knew nothing of the meaning of tho&s;e plain pa&s;&s;ages in the old te&s;tament which were daily fulfilling before their eyes. Whenever that time &s;hall arrive, tho&s;e truths which have e&s;caped our notice, or, if di&s;covered, have been thought to be oppo&s;ed to each other, or to be incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, will then like the &s;tones of Solomon's temple, be found &s;o exactly to accord with each other, that they &s;hall be cement|ed without noi&s;e or force, into one &s;imple and &s;ublime &s;y&s;tem of religion.</P>
<P>But further, we err, not only in religion but in phi|lo&s;ophy likewi&s;e, becau&s;e we
<Q>do not know or <HI>believe</HI> the &s;criptures.</Q>
The &s;ciences have been compared to a circle of which religion compo&s;es a part. To under|&s;tand any one of them perfectly it is nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome knowledge of them all. Bacon, Boyle, and Newton included the &s;criptures in the inquiries to which their univer&s;al geniu&s;es di&s;po&s;ed them, and their philo&s;ophy was aided by their knowledge in them. A &s;triking agree|ment has been lately di&s;covered between the hi&s;tory of certain events recorded in the bible and &s;ome of the operations and productions of nature, particularly tho&s;e which are related in Whitehur&s;t's ob&s;ervations on the
<PB N="102" REF="034495_0108_0FFE01A71608C328">
deluge&mdash;in Smith's account of the origin of the variety of colour in the human &s;pecies, and in Bruce's travels. It remains yet to be &s;hown how many other events, related in the bible, accord with &s;ome late important di&s;coveries in the principles of medecine. The events, and the principles alluded to, mutually e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of each other. From the di&s;coveries of the chri&s;tian philo&s;ophers, who&s;e names have been la&s;t mentioned, I have been led to que&s;tion whether mo&s;t harm has been done to revelation, by tho&s;e divines who have unduly multiplied the objects of faith, or by tho&s;e dei&s;ts who have unduly multiplied the objects of rea&s;on, in explaining the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to an&s;wer &s;ome of the objec|tions which have been made to the u&s;e of the bible as a &s;chool book.</P>
<P N="1">I. We are told, that the familiar u&s;e of the bible in our &s;chools, has a tendency to le&s;&s;en a due reverence for it. This objection, by proving too much, proves nothing at all. If familiarity le&s;&s;ens re&s;pect for divine things, then all tho&s;e precepts of our religion, which enjoin the daily or weekly wor&s;hip of the Deity, are improper. The bible was not intended to repre&s;ent a Jewi&s;h ark; and it is an antichri&s;tian idea, to &s;uppo&s;e that it can be profaned, by being carried into a &s;chool hou&s;e, or by being handled by children. But where will the bible be read by young people with more reverence than in a &s;chool? Not in mo&s;t private families; for I believe there are few parents, who pre|&s;erve
<PB N="103" REF="034495_0109_0FFE01A8A6014750">
&s;o much order in their hou&s;es, as is kept up in our common Engli&s;h &s;chools.</P>
<P N="2">II. We are told, that there are many pa&s;&s;ages in the old te&s;tament, that are improper to be read by children, and that the greate&s;t part of it is no way in|tere&s;ting to mankind under the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel. There are I grant, &s;everal chapters, and many ver&s;es in the old te&s;tament, which in their pre&s;ent unfortunate tran&s;lation, &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed over by children. But I deny that any of the books of the old te&s;tament are not intere&s;ting to mankind, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. Mo&s;t of the characters, events, and ceremonies, mentioned in them, are per&s;o|nal, providential, or in&s;tituted types of the Me&s;&s;iah: All of which have been, or remain yet to be, fulfilled by him. It is from an ignorance or neglect of the&s;e types, that we have &s;o many dei&s;ts in chri&s;tendom; for &s;o irrefragably do they prove the truth of chri&s;tianity, that I am &s;ure a young man who had been regularly in&s;tructed in their meaning, could never doubt after|wards of the truth of any of its principles. If any ob|&s;curity appears in the&s;e principles, it is only (to u&s;e the words of the poet) becau&s;e <HI>they are dark, with ex|ce&s;&s;ive bright.</HI></P>
<P>I know there is an objection among many Peo|ple to teach children doctrines of any kind, becau&s;e they are liable to be controverted. But where will this objection lead us?&mdash; The being of a God, and the obligations of morality, have both been
<PB N="104" REF="034495_0110_0FFE01ADE00E15D0">
controverted; and yet who has objected to our teach|ing the&s;e doctrines to our chilldren?</P>
<P>The curio&s;ity and capacities of young people for the my&s;teries of religion, awaken much &s;ooner than is generally &s;uppo&s;ed. Of this we have two remarkable proofs in the old te&s;tament. The fir&s;t is mentioned in the twelfth chapter of Exodus. <Q>And it &s;hall come when your <HI>children</HI> &s;hall &s;ay unto you, "<HI>What mean you by this &s;ervice</HI>?" that ye &s;hall &s;ay,
<Q>It is the &s;acra|fice of the Lord's pa&s;&s;over, who pa&s;&s;ed over the hou&s;es of the children of I&s;rael in Egypt, when he &s;mote the Egyptians, and delivered our hou&s;es. And the chil|dren of I&s;rael went away, and did as the Lord had commanded Mo&s;es and Aaron.</Q></Q>
A &s;econd proof of the de&s;ire of children to be in&s;tructed in the my&s;teries of religion, is to be found in the &s;ixth chapter of Deuter|onomy. <Q>And when thy &s;on <HI>a&s;keth</HI> thee in the time to come &s;aying,
<Q>What mean the te&s;timonies&mdash;and the &s;tatutes&mdash;and the judgments which the Lord our God hath commanded you?</Q>
Then thou &s;halt &s;ay unto thy &s;on,
<Q>We were Pharoah's bondmen in Egypt, and the Lord our God brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</Q></Q>
The&s;e enquiries from the mouths of children are perfectly natural; for where is the parent who has not had &s;imilar que&s;tions propo&s;ed to him by his children upon their being being fir&s;t conduct|ed to a place of wor&s;hip, or upon their beholding, for the fir&s;t time, either of the &s;acraments of our religion?</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="034495_0111_0FFE01AF6A1577D0">Let us not not be wi&s;er than our Maker. If moral precepts alone could have reformed mankind, the mi&s;|&s;ion of the Son of God into our world, would have been unnece&s;&s;ary. He came to promulgate a &s;y&s;tem of <HI>doctrines,</HI> as well as a &s;y&s;tem of morals. The perfect morality of the go&s;pel re&s;ts upon a <HI>doctrine,</HI> which, though often controverted, has never been refuted, I mean the vicarious life and death of the Son of God. This &s;ublime and ineffable doctrine delivers us from the ab&s;urd hypothe&s;es of modern philo&s;ophers, con|cerning the foundation of moral obligation, and fixes it upon the eternal and &s;elf moving principle of LOVE. It concentrates a whole &s;y&s;tem of ethics in a &s;ingle text of &s;cripture. "<HI>A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another, even as I have loved you.</HI>" By witholding the knowledge of this doctrine from children, we deprive our&s;elves of the be&s;t means of awakening moral &s;en&s;ibility in their minds. We do more, we furni&s;h an argument, for witholding from them a knowledge of the morality of the go&s;pel like|wi&s;e; for this, in many in&s;tances, is as &s;upernatural, and therefore as liable to be controverted, as any of the doctrines or miracles which are mentioned in the new te&s;tament. The miraculous conception of the &s;aviour of the world by a virgin, is not more oppo&s;ed to the ordinary cour&s;e of natural events, nor is the doctrine of the atonement more above human rea&s;on, than tho&s;e moral precepts, which command us to love our enemies, or to die for our friends.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="106" REF="034495_0112_0FFE01B0F31EEDE8">III. It has been &s;aid, that the divi&s;ion of the bible into chapters and ver&s;es, renders it more difficult to be read, by children than many other books.</P>
<P>By a little care in a ma&s;ter, this difficulty may be ob|viated, and even an advantage derived from it. It may &s;erve to transfer the attention of the &s;cholar to the <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> of a &s;ubject; and no per&s;on will ever read well, who is guided by any thing el&s;e, in his &s;tops, em|pha&s;is, or accents. The divi&s;ion of the bible into chapters and ver&s;es, is not a greater ob&s;tacle to its be|ing read with ea&s;e, than the bad punctuation of mo&s;t other books. I deliver this &s;tricture upon other books, from the authority of Mr. Rice, the celebrated author of the art of &s;peaking, whom I heard declare in a large company in London, that he had never &s;een a book properly pointed in the Engli&s;h Language. He exem|plified, notwith&s;tanding, by reading to the &s;ame com|pany a pa&s;&s;age from Milton, his perfect knowledge of the art of reading.</P>
<P>Some people, I know, have propo&s;ed to introduce extracts from the bible, into our &s;chools, in&s;tead of the bible it&s;elf. Many excellent works of this kind, are in print, but if we admit any one of them, we &s;hall have the &s;ame inundation of them that we have had of grammars, &s;pelling books, and le&s;&s;ons for children, many of which are publi&s;hed for the benefit of the authors only, and all of them have tended greatly to in|crea&s;e the expence of education. Be&s;ides, the&s;e extracts
<PB N="107" REF="034495_0113_0FFE01B3B4982068">
or abridgements of the bible, often contain the tenets of particular &s;ects or per&s;ons, and therefore, may be im|proper for &s;chools compo&s;ed of the children of differ|ent &s;ects of chri&s;tians. The bible is a cheap book, and is to be had in every book&s;tore. It is, moreover, e&s;teemed and prefered by all &s;ects; becau&s;e each finds its peculiar doctrines in it. It &s;hould therefore be u&s;ed in preference to any abridgements of it, or hi&s;to|ries extracted from it.</P>
<P>I have heard it propo&s;ed that a portion of the bible &s;hould be read every day by the ma&s;ter, as a means of in&s;tructing children in it: But this is a poor &s;ub&s;titute for obliging children to read it as a &s;chool book; for by this means we in&s;en&s;ibly <HI>engrave,</HI> as it were, its con|tents upon their minds: and it has been remarked that children, in&s;tructed in this way in the &s;criptures, &s;el|dom forget any part of them. They have the &s;ame advantage over tho&s;e per&s;ons, who have only heard the &s;criptures read by a ma&s;ter, that a man who has work|ed with the tools of a mechanical employment for &s;eve|ral years, has over the man who has only &s;tood a few hours in a work &s;hop and &s;een the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s carri|ed on by other people.</P>
<P>In this defence of the u&s;e of the bible as a &s;chool book, I beg you would not think that I &s;uppo&s;e the Bi|ble to contain the only revelation which God has made to man. I believe in an internal revelation, or a moral
<PB N="108" REF="034495_0114_0FFE01B693F7B990">
principle, which God has implanted in the heart of every man, as the precur&s;or of his final dominion over the whole human race. How much this internal reve|lation accords with the external, remains yet to be ex|plored by philo&s;ophers. I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that mo&s;t of the doctrines of chri&s;tianity revealed in the bi|ble might be di&s;covered by a clo&s;e examination of all the principles of action in man: But who is equal to &s;uch an enquiry? It certainly does not &s;uit the natural in|dolence, or laborious employments of a great majority of mankind. The internal revelation of the go&s;pel may be compared to the &s;traight line which is made through a wilderne&s;s by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a compa&s;s, to a di&s;tant country, which few are able to di&s;cover, while the bible re&s;embles a public road to the &s;ame country, which is wide, plain, and ea&s;ily found. "And a highway &s;hall be there, and it &s;hall be called the way of holine&s;s. The way faring men, though fools, &s;hall not err therein."</P>
<P>Neither let me in this place exclude the Revelation which God has made of him&s;elf to man in the works of creation. I am far from wi&s;hing to le&s;&s;en the in|fluence of this &s;pecies of Revelation upon mankind. But the knowledge of God obtained from this &s;ource, is ob&s;cure and feeble in its operation, compared with that which is derived from the bible. The vi&s;ible creation &s;peaks of the Deity in hyeroglyphics, while the bible de&s;|cribes all his attributes and perfections in &s;uch plain,
<PB N="109" REF="034495_0115_0FFE01BA92D891D8">
and familiar language that
<Q>he who runs may read.</Q></P>
<P>How kindly has our maker dealt with his creatures, in providing three different cords to draw them to him&s;elf! But how weakly do &s;ome men act, who &s;u&s;pend their faith, and hopes upon only one of them! By laying hold of them all, they would approach more &s;peedily and certainly to the centre of all hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>To the arguments I have mentioned in favour of the u&s;e of the bible as a &s;chool book, I &s;hall add a few reflections.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent fa&s;hionable practice of rejecting the bible from our &s;chools, I &s;u&s;pect has originated with the dei&s;ts. They di&s;cover great ingenuity in this new mode of attacking chri&s;tianity. If they proceed in it, they will do more in half a century, in extirpating our religion, than Bolingbroke or Voltaire could have ef|fected in a thou&s;and years. I am not writing to this cla&s;s of people. I de&s;pair of changing the opinions of any of them. I wi&s;h only to alter the opinions and con|duct of tho&s;e lukewarm, or &s;uper&s;titious chri&s;tians, who have been mi&s;led by the dei&s;ts upon this &s;ubject. On the ground of the good old cu&s;tom, of u&s;ing the bible as a &s;chool book, it becomes us to entrench our religion. It is the la&s;t bulwark the dei&s;ts have left it; for they have rendered in&s;truction in the principles
<PB N="110" REF="034495_0116_0FFE01BD5445C220">
of chri&s;tianity by the pulpit and the pre&s;s, &s;o unfa&s;hiona|ble, that little good for many years &s;eems to have been done by either of them.</P>
<P>The effects of the di&s;u&s;e of the bible, as a &s;chool book have appeared of late in the neglect and even contempt with which &s;cripture names are treated by many peo|ple. It is becau&s;e parents have not been early taught to know or re&s;pect the characters and exploits of the old and new te&s;tament worthies, that their names are exchanged for tho&s;e of the modern kings of Europe, or of the principal characters in novels and romances. I conceive there may be &s;ome advantage in bearing &s;crip|ture names. It may lead the per&s;ons who bear them, to &s;tudy that part of the &s;criptures, in which their names are mentioned, with uncommon attention, and perhaps it may excite a de&s;ire in them to po&s;&s;e&s;s the talents or vir|tues of their ancient name&s;akes. This remark fir&s;t occur|red to me, upon hearing a pious woman who&s;e name was Mary, &s;ay, that the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages of the bible, which made a &s;erious impre&s;&s;ion on her mind, were tho&s;e in|tere&s;ting chapters and ver&s;es in which the name of Mary is mentioned in the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ingular fact, that while the names of the kings and emperors of Rome, are now given chiefly to <HI>hor&s;es</HI> and <HI>dogs</HI> &s;cripture names have hitherto been con|fined only to the human &s;pecies. Let the enemies and contemners of tho&s;e names take care, le&s;t the names of
<PB N="111" REF="034495_0117_0FFE01BEE6E03D70">
more modern kings be given hereafter only to the &s;ame animals, and le&s;t the names of the modern heroines of romances be given to animals of an inferior &s;pecies.</P>
<P>It is with great plea&s;ure, that I have ob&s;erved the bi|ble to be the only book read in the Sunday &s;chools in England. We have adopted the &s;ame practice in the Sunday &s;chools, lately e&s;tabli&s;hed in this city. This will give our religion (humanly &s;peaking) the chance of a longer life in our country. We hear much of the per&s;ons educated in free &s;chools in England, turning out well in the various walks of life. I have enquired into the cau&s;e of it, and have &s;atisfied my&s;elf, that it is wholly to be a&s;cribed to the general u&s;e of the bible in tho&s;e &s;chools, for it &s;eems the children of poor people are of too little con&s;equence to be guarded from the &s;uppo&s;ed evils of reading the &s;criptures in early life, or in an uncon&s;ecrated &s;chool hou&s;e.</P>
<P>However great the benefits of reading the &s;criptures in &s;chools have been, I cannot help remarking, that the&s;e benefits might be much greater, did &s;choolma&s;ters take more pains to explain them to their &s;cholars. Did they demon&s;trate the divine original of the bible from the purity, con&s;i&s;tency, and benevolence of its doctrines and precepts&mdash;did they explain the meaning of the levitical in&s;titutions, and &s;how their application to the numerous and &s;uce&s;&s;ive go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ations&mdash;did they inform their pupils that the gro&s;s and abominable vices
<PB N="112" REF="034495_0118_0FFE01C424C93C80">
of the Jews were recorded <HI>only</HI> as proofs of the depravi|ty of human nature, and of the in&s;ufficiency of the law, to produce moral virtue and thereby to e&s;tabli&s;h the nece&s;&s;ity and perfection of the go&s;pel &s;y&s;tem&mdash;and above all, did they often enforce the di&s;cour&s;es of our Saviour, as the be&s;t rule of life, and the &s;ure&s;t guide to hap|pine&s;s, how great would be the influence of our &s;chools upon the order and pro&s;perity of our country! Such a mode of in&s;tructing children in the chri&s;tian religion, would convey knowledge into their <HI>under&s;tandings,</HI> and would therefore be preferable to teaching them creeds, and catechi&s;ms, which too often convey, not know|ledge, but <HI>words</HI> only, into their <HI>memories.</HI> I think I am not too &s;anguine in believing, that education, con|ducted in this manner, would, in the cour&s;e of two generations, eradicate infidelity from among us, and render civil government &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary in our coun|try.</P>
<P>In contemplating the political in&s;titutions of the United States, I lament, that we wa&s;te &s;o much time and money in puni&s;hing crimes, and take &s;o little pains to prevent them. We profe&s;s to be republicans, and yet we neglect the only means of e&s;tabli&s;hing and per|petuating our republican forms of government, that is, the univer&s;al education of our youth in the principles of chri&s;tianity, by means of the bible; for this divine book, above all others, favours that equality among mankind, that re&s;pect for ju&s;t laws, and all tho&s;e &s;ober
<PB N="113" REF="034495_0119_0FFE01C5AD10E938">
and frugal virtues, which con&s;titute the &s;oul of repub|licani&s;m.</P>
<P>I have now only to apologize for havging addre&s;&s;ed this letter to you, after having been a&s;&s;ured by you, that your opinion, re&s;pecting the u&s;e of the bible as a &s;chool book, coincided with mine. My excu&s;e for what I have done is, that I knew you were qualified by your knowledge, and di&s;po&s;ed by your zeal in the cau&s;e of truth, to correct all the errors you would di&s;|cover in my letter. Perhaps a further apology may be nece&s;&s;ary for my having pre&s;umed to write upon a &s;ubject &s;o much above my ordinary &s;tudies. My excu&s;e for it is, that I thought a &s;ingle mite from a member of a profe&s;&s;ion, which has been frequently charged with &s;ceptici&s;m in religion, might attract the notice of per&s;ons who had often overlooked the more ample contributions upon this &s;ubject, of gentlemen of other profe&s;&s;ions. With great re&s;pect, I am, dear &s;ir, your &s;incere friend.</P>

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL OF EVERY DENOMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES, UPON SUBJECTS INTERESTING TO MORALS.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the nature of your pur&s;uits, and from your influence in &s;ociety, I am encouraged to addre&s;s you upon &s;ubjects of the utmo&s;t impor|tance to the pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s of your fel|low-citizens, as well as to the pro&s;perity of the United States.</P>
<P>Under the great diver&s;ity of opinions, you entertain in religion, you are all united in inculcating the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of morals. In this bu&s;ine&s;s you are neither catholics nor prote&s;tants&mdash;churchmen nor di&s;&s;enters. One &s;pirit actuates you all. From the &s;ucce&s;s, or failure of your exertions in the cau&s;e of virtue, we anticipate the freedom or &s;lavery of our country. Even the new government of the united &s;tates, from which &s;o many advantages are expected, will neither re&s;tore order, nor e&s;tabli&s;h ju&s;tice among us, unle&s;s it be ac|companied and &s;upported by morality, among all cla&s;&s;es of people. Impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the truth of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, I &s;hall briefly point out a few of tho&s;e practices, which prevail in America, which ex|ert
<PB N="115" REF="034495_0121_0FFE01CA141B6660">
a pernicious influence upon morals, and thereby prepare our country for mi&s;ery and &s;lavery.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin by pointing out, in the fir&s;t place, the mi&s;chevious effects of &s;pirituos liquors upon the morals of our citizens.</P>
<P N="1">I. They render the temper peevi&s;h and pa&s;&s;ionate. They beget quarrels, and lead to profane and indecent language. They are the parents of idlene&s;s and ex|travagance, and the certain forerunners of poverty, and frequently of jails, wheelbarrows, and the gallows. They are likewi&s;e injurious to health and life, and kill more than the pe&s;tilence, or the &s;word. Our legi&s;|latures, by premitting the u&s;e of them, for the &s;ake of the paltry duty collected from them, act as ab&s;urdly as a prince would do, who &s;hould permit the cul|tivation of a poi&s;onous nut, which every year car|ried off ten thou&s;and of his &s;ubjects, becau&s;e it yielded a revenue of thirty thou&s;and pounds a year. The&s;e ten thou&s;and men would produce annually by their labour, or by paying a trifling impo&s;t upon any one of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, twenty times that &s;um. In order to put an end to the de&s;olating effects of &s;pirituous liquors, it will be proper for our mini&s;ters to preach again&s;t, not the abu&s;e of them only, but their u&s;e al|together. They are never nece&s;&s;ary but in &s;ickne&s;s: and then they are better applied to the out&s;ide, than to the in&s;ide of the body.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="116" REF="034495_0122_0FFE01CE181344E0">II Militia laws have an unfriendly influence upon morals, more e&s;pecially where they authori&s;e the elec|tion of the officers by the privates. The meetings of citizens for militia exerci&s;es are generally attended with intemperance in drinking, quarrelling, profane &s;wearing, and acts of violence to the property of the per&s;ons who live near the places where tho&s;e meetings are held. It is a mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e that the defence of liberty requires a well organized militia in the time of peace.</P>
<P>The United States proved in the beginning of the late war, and France has proved &s;ince, that armies of di&s;ciplined irre&s;i&s;table troops may be formed in a &s;hort time out of the pea&s;ants of a country. War has lately be|come a &s;imple art. All that is practical in it, may be acquired in a few weeks. The mo&s;t gallant exploits were performed during the late war, by men who had been but a few days in the practice of handling fire arms.</P>
<P N="3">III. Fairs are a Pandora's box opened twice a year, in many of the &s;tates. They are wholly unnece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince &s;hops are &s;o common in all the civilized parts of the country. They tempt to extravagance&mdash;gaming &mdash;drunkenne&s;s&mdash;and uncleanne&s;s. They are proper only in de&s;potic &s;tates, where the more a people are corrupted, the more readily they &s;ubmit to arbitrary government.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Law-&s;uits &s;hould be di&s;couraged as much as po&s;&s;ible. They are highly di&s;reputable between per&s;ons
<PB N="117" REF="034495_0123_0FFE01D0E2D86CE8">
who profe&s;&s;es chri&s;tianity. The attendance upon courts expo&s;es to idlene&s;s&mdash;drinking and gaming; and the u&s;ual delays of ju&s;tice &s;eldom fail of entailing hereditary di&s;cord among neighbours. It is with inexpre&s;&s;ible plea|&s;ure that I have lately &s;een an account of a recom|mendation from the pre&s;byterian &s;ynod of New-York and Philadelphia, to all the churches under their care to &s;ettle their di&s;putes after the manner of the pri|mitive chri&s;tians and friends, by arbitration. Ble&s;&s;ed event in the hi&s;tory of mankind! may their practice &s;pread among all &s;ects of chri&s;tians, and may it prove a prelude of that happy time foretold in the &s;crip|tures, when war and murder &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P N="5">V. The licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;s is a fruitful &s;ource of the corruption of morals. Men are deterred from in|juring each other, chiefly by the fear of detection or puni&s;hment. Now both of the&s;e are removed by the u&s;ual &s;ecrecy of a licentious pre&s;s. Hence revenge, &s;candal and fal&s;ehood are cheri&s;hed and propagated in a community. But further: the cau&s;e of liberty is greatly injured by per&s;onal calumnies; for who will believe a truth that is told of a bad man, that has been accu&s;tomed to read fal&s;ehoods publi&s;hed every day of a good man? Printers who vend &s;currility, would do well in con&s;idering, that the publi&s;her of &s;candal, is as bad as the author of it, in the &s;ame manner that the receiver of &s;tolen goods, is as bad as the thief.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="034495_0124_0FFE01D26B2EEA98">It becomes the purcha&s;ers, and readers of per&s;onal &s;candal likewi&s;e to con&s;ider that they are accomplices in the guilt of the authors of it. We read with hor|ror the accounts of human depravity which has con|verted public executions into part of the amu&s;ements of &s;everal ancient and modern nations, but the depra|vity of the human heart is of the &s;ame nature in that man, who can read with plea&s;ure, or even indifference, the mangled character of a fellow citizen in a licentious new&s;paper.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Hor&s;e-racing and cock-fighting are unfriendly amu&s;ements to morals, and of cour&s;e to the liberties of our country. They occa&s;ion idlene&s;s, fraud, gaming and profane &s;wearing, and harden the heart again&s;t the feelings of humanity. The&s;e vulgar &s;ports &s;hould be forbidden by law in all chri&s;tian and republican coun|tries.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Clubs of all kinds, where the only bu&s;ine&s;s of the company, is feeding (for that is the true name of a gratification that is &s;imply animal) are hurtful to morals. The &s;ociety in taverns where clubs are u&s;ually held, is &s;eldom &s;ubject to much order. It expo&s;es men to idlene&s;s, prodigality, and debt. It is in private families, only that &s;ociety is innocent, or improving. Here manners are u&s;ually kept within the bounds of decen|cy by the company of females, who generally compo&s;e
<PB N="119" REF="034495_0125_0FFE01D546BD4010">
a part of all private families; and manners, it is well known, have an influence upon morals.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Amu&s;ements of every kind, on Sundays, beget habits of idlene&s;s and a love of plea&s;ure, which extend their influence to every day of the week. In tho&s;e manufacturing towns in England, where the Sundays are &s;pent in idlene&s;s or frolicking, little or no work is ever done on the en&s;uing day; hence it is called St. Mon|day. If there were no hereafter&mdash;individuals and &s;o|cieties would be great gainers, by attending public wor&s;hip every Sunday. Re&s;t from labour in the hou&s;e of God, winds up the machine of both &s;oul and body, better than any thing el&s;e, and thereby invigorates it for the labours and duties of the en&s;uing week. Should I ever travel into a chri&s;tian country, and wi&s;h to know whether the laws of that country were wi&s;e and ju&s;t, and whether they were duly obeyed, the only que&s;tion I would a&s;k, &s;hould be "do the people &s;pend Sunday at church, or in plea&s;urable entertainments at home and abroad?" the Sunday &s;chools in England have been found extremely u&s;eful in reforming the children of poor people. Who can witne&s;s the practices of &s;wimming, &s;liding and &s;cating, which prevail &s;o univer|&s;ally on Sundays, in mo&s;t of the cities of the United States, and not wi&s;h for &s;imilar in&s;titutions to re&s;cues our poor children from de&s;truction? I &s;hall conclude my remarks upon this &s;ubject, by declaring, that I do not wi&s;h to &s;ee any new laws made to enforce the keeping
<PB N="120" REF="034495_0126_0FFE01D702BA97D8">
of the Sabbath. I call upon mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel only, to increa&s;e and extend, by their influence, the pure and u&s;eful &s;pirit of their religion In riding through our country, we may always tell, by the ap|pearance of the people we meet with on the road, or &s;ee at taverns, whether they enjoy the benefit of public wor&s;hip, and of a vigilant and faithful mini&s;try. Where a &s;ettlement enjoys the&s;e ine&s;timable be&s;&s;ings, we generally find taverns de&s;erted on a Sunday, and a &s;tillne&s;s pervading the whole neighbourhood&punc; as if nature her&s;elf had cea&s;ed from her labours, to &s;hare with man in paying her weekly homage to God for his creating goodne&s;s</P>
<P>Thus I have briefly pointed out the principal &s;our|ces of vice in our country. They are all of a public nature, and affect, in a direct manner, the general in|tere&s;ts of &s;ociety. I &s;hall now &s;ugge&s;t a few &s;ources of vice, which are of a dome&s;tic nature, and which in|directly affect the happine&s;s of our country.</P>
<P N="1">I. The frequent or long ab&s;ence of the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s from home, by di&s;&s;olving the bounds of dome&s;tic government, proves a fruitful &s;ource of vice among children and &s;ervants. To prevent in &s;ome degree, the inconveniencies which ari&s;e from the nece&s;&s;ary ab|&s;ence of the heads of a family, from home, it would be a good practice to inve&s;t the elde&s;t &s;on or daughter, when of a &s;uitable age&punc; with the government of the family and to make them re&s;pon&s;ible for their conduct, upon
<PB N="121" REF="034495_0127_0FFE01DD6CF61220">
the return of their parents. Government in a family is like an electric rod to a hou&s;e. Where it is wanting a family is expo&s;ed to the attacks of every folly and vice, that come within the &s;phere of its attraction.</P>
<P N="2">II. Frequent and large entertainments weaken do|me&s;tic government, by removing children and &s;ervants too long from the eye of authority. They moreover, expo&s;e children and &s;ervants to the temptation of eat|ting and drinking to exce&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">III. Boys and girls &s;hould never be admitted as &s;er|vants&mdash;into a genteel family. They are &s;eldom in|&s;tructed properly, by their ma&s;ters or mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. Their lei&s;ure hours are moreover &s;pent in bad compa|ny: and all the vices which they pick up, are &s;pread among the children of the family, who are generally more prone to a&s;&s;ociate with them, than with any other. Where poverty or death makes it nece&s;&s;ary to bind out children, they &s;hould be bound to tho&s;e per&s;ons only, who will work with them. By the&s;e means, they will be trained to indu&s;try, and kept from idlene&s;s and vice.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Servants, both male and female &s;hould always be hired by the year, otherwi&s;e no proper government can be e&s;tabli&s;hed over them. The impertinence and irregular conduct of &s;ervants, ari&s;e from their holding their places by too &s;hort a tenure. It would be a good law to fine every per&s;on, who hired a &s;ervant, without a written good character, &s;igned by his la&s;t ma&s;ter,
<PB N="122" REF="034495_0128_0FFE01DF2D71C618">
and counter&s;igned by a magi&s;trate. This practice would &s;oon drive bad &s;ervants out of the civilized parts of our country and thereby prevent much evil both in families and &s;ociety. How many young men and wo|men have carried through life the &s;orrowful marks in their con&s;ciences or characters, of their being early ini|tiated into the my&s;teries of vice, by unprincipled &s;er|vants of both &s;exes! Servants that are married, &s;hould be preferred to &s;uch as are &s;ingle. Matrimony in all ranks of people le&s;&s;ens the temptation to vice, and fur|ni&s;hes fre&s;h motives to ju&s;t conduct.</P>
<P N="5">V. Apprentices &s;hould always board and lodge, if po&s;|&s;ible, with their ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, when they are &s;eparated from their parents. Young people &s;eldom fall into bad company in the day time. It is in the evening, when they cea&s;e to be &s;ubject to government, that they are in the mo&s;t danger of corruption: and this danger can be obviated only by &s;ubjecting all their hours to the direction of their ma&s;ters or mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this addre&s;s, by &s;ugge&s;ting to mini|&s;ters of the go&s;pel, a plan of a new &s;pecies of federal government for the advancement of morals in the Uni|ted States. Let each &s;ect appoint a repre&s;entative in a general convention of chri&s;tians, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall be, to unite in promoting the general objects of chri&s;|tianity. Let no matters of faith or opinion ever be in|troduced into this convention, but let them be con&s;ider|ed
<PB N="123" REF="034495_0129_0FFE01E0B6D093D8">
as badges of the &s;overeignty of each particular &s;ect. To prevent all di&s;putes, let the objects of the delibera|tions of this general convention be a&s;certained with the &s;ame accuracy, that the powers of the national govern|ment are defined in the new con&s;titution of the United States. By this previous compact, no encroachments will ever be made by the general government, upon the principles&mdash;di&s;cipline&mdash;or habits of any one &s;ect&mdash; for in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human nature, the divi&s;ion of chri&s;tians into &s;ects, is as nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence and pre&s;ervation of chri&s;tianity, as the divi&s;ion of man|kind into nations, and of nations into &s;eparate families are nece&s;&s;ary to promote general and private happine&s;s. By means of &s;uch an in&s;titution, chri&s;tian charity will be promoted, and the di&s;cipline of each church will be &s;trengthened&mdash;for I would propo&s;e, that a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion for immorality, from any one church, &s;hould exclude a man from every church in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical union. But the advantages of this chri&s;tian convention will not end here. It will po&s;&s;e&s;s an influence over the laws of the United States. This influence will differ from that of mo&s;t of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical a&s;&s;ociations that have exi&s;ted in the world. It will be the influence of rea&s;on over the pa&s;&s;ions of men. Its objects will be morals, not principles, and the de&s;ign of it will be, not to make men zealous members of any one church, but to make them&mdash;good neighbours&mdash;good hu&s;bands&mdash;good fathers &mdash;good ma&s;ters&mdash;good &s;ervants&mdash;and of cour&s;e good

<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY INTO THE CONSISTENCY OF OATHS WITH REASON AND CHRISTIANITY.</HEAD>
<P>IN di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this que&s;tion, I &s;hall fir&s;t mention the objections to oaths, which are founded in rea&s;on; and, &s;econdly, the objections to them which are derived from the precepts and &s;pirit of the chri&s;|tian religion.</P>
<P N="1">I. Oaths produce an idea in the minds of men, that there are <HI>two</HI> kinds or degrees of truth; the one intend|ed for common, and the other for &s;olemn occa&s;ions. Now, this idea is directly calculated to beget a want of reverence for the <HI>inferior</HI> kind of truth; hence men are led to trifle with it in the common affairs of hu|man life. I grant that &s;ome men will tell the truth, when urged to it by the &s;olemn formalities of an oath, who would not otherwi&s;e do it: But this proves the great mi&s;chief of oaths in &s;ociety; for as men are called upon to &s;peak the truth 999 <HI>times</HI> in com|mon life, to <HI>once</HI> they are called upon to <HI>&s;wear</HI> to it, we have exactly 999 fal&s;ehoods to <HI>one</HI> truth told by them. How exten&s;ive, then, mu&s;t be the mi&s;chief of this great di&s;proportion between truth and fal&s;ehood, in all the affairs of human life! It is wrong to do
<PB N="126" REF="034495_0132_0FFE01EA454B3D68">
any thing that &s;hall create an idea of two kinds of truth. There is a &s;cale of fal&s;ehoods; but truth has no degrees or &s;ubdivi&s;ions. Like its divine author, it is an eternal unchangeable UNIT.</P>
<P N="2">II. The practice of &s;wearing according to human laws, appears to be the cau&s;e of all profane &s;wear|ing, which is &s;o univer&s;al among all ranks of people in common conver&s;ation; for if there are two modes of &s;peaking the truth, it is natural for men to pre|fer that mode which the laws of our country have entitled to the fir&s;t degree of credibility: hence men &s;wear, when they wi&s;h to be believed, in common con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="3">III. Oaths have been multiplied upon &s;o many trifling occa&s;ions, that they have cea&s;ed, in a great degree, to operate with any force upon the mo&s;t &s;olemn occa&s;ions: hence the univer&s;al prevalence of <HI>perjury</HI> in courts, armies and cu&s;tom-hou&s;es, all over the world. This fact is &s;o notorious in Jamaica, that a law has lately been pa&s;&s;ed in that i&s;land, which re|quires a bond of &pound;.200, in&s;tead of an oath, from every captain that enters his ve&s;&s;el in the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, as a &s;ecurity for his veracity in the manife&s;t of his cargo, and for the amount of his duties to the govern|ment.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on and &s;cripture (when perfectly under&s;tood) are never <HI>contrary</HI> to each other; and revelation from God can never give a &s;anction to that which is &s;o
<PB N="127" REF="034495_0133_0FFE01ED27BB0540">
evidently ab&s;urd, and unfriendly to the intere&s;ts of hu|man &s;ociety. Let us proceed then to examine the bible, and here we &s;hall find, that oaths are as contrary to the precepts and &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity as they are to &s;ound rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Before I mention either the precepts or the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, which militate again&s;t oaths, I &s;hall men|tion a few of the ca&s;es of &s;wearing which I find upon record in the New Te&s;tament. I &s;hall fir&s;t mention the precedents in favour of this practice, and then the precepts and precedents again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> precedent I &s;hall produce, is taken from the example of the devil, who addre&s;&s;es our Saviour in an oath, in Mark v.7. "What have I to do with thee, Je&s;us, thou &s;on of the mo&s;t high God? I adjure thee <HI>by God</HI> that thou torment me not."</P>
<P>A <HI>&s;econd</HI> precedent is taken from the example of the high prie&s;t, who addre&s;&s;es our Saviour in an oath in Matthew, xxvi.63. "I adjure thee," &s;ays he, ju&s;t before he con&s;ents to his death, "by the <HI>living God,</HI> that thou tell us whether thou be the Chri&s;t the &s;on of God." It has been &s;aid that there was no impro|priety in this mode of expre&s;&s;ion, otherwi&s;e our Sa|viour would have rebuked it: but let it be remem|bered, that he &s;tood before the tribunal of a high|prie&s;t, as a <HI>pri&s;oner,</HI> and not as a <HI>teacher;</HI> and hence we find he &s;ubmits in <HI>&s;ilence</HI> to all the prophane in|&s;ults that were offered him. In this &s;ilent &s;ubmi&s;&s;i|on
<PB N="128" REF="034495_0134_0FFE01EFE765BD38">
to in&s;ult, he moreover fulfilled an ancient prophe&s;y "he is brought as a lamb to the &s;laughter and as a &s;heep before his &s;hearers is dumb, &s;o he openeth not his mouth" I&s;aiah LIII.7.</P>
<P>Peter furni&s;hes a <HI>third</HI> in&s;tance of &s;wearing. "And again he <HI>denied</HI>" (&s;ays Matthew, chap. XXVI.72.) "with an <HI>oath,</HI> I know not the man." It would &s;eem from this account, that a bare <HI>affirma|tion</HI> was &s;o characteri&s;tic of a disciple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that Peter could not u&s;e a more direct method to convince the maid, who charged him with being a follower of Je&s;us of Nazareth, that he was <HI>not</HI> a <HI>chri&s;tian,</HI> than by having recour&s;e to the Jewi&s;h and pagan practice of taking an oath.</P>
<P>Herod furni&s;hes a <HI>fourth</HI> in&s;tance of &s;wearing, in Matthew XIV.7, when he promi&s;ed to give the daugh|ter of Herodias whatever &s;he &s;hould a&s;k of him: &s;he a&s;ked for John the bapti&s;t's head in a charger: the king repented of his ha&s;ty promi&s;e; "neverthele&s;s, for the oath's &s;ake, and them which &s;at with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her." Here it is evident he would have violated a common pro|mi&s;e. But if common promi&s;es are not held &s;acred, and binding, there is an end of a great portion of truth in &s;ociety, and of all the order and happine&s;s which ari&s;e from it. To &s;ecure con&s;tant and uni|ver&s;al truth, men &s;hould &s;wear <HI>always</HI> or <HI>not at all.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="034495_0135_0FFE01F2A91983D0">A <HI>fifth</HI> precedent for &s;wearing we find in the xix of Acts and 13th ver&s;e. "Then certain of the vaga|bond Jews, exorci&s;ts, took upon them to call over them which had evil &s;pirits, the name of the Lord Je&s;us, &s;aying, <HI>we adjure thee,</HI> by Je&s;us whom Paul preacheth. And the man in whom the evil &s;pirit was, leaped on them, and overcame them; &s;o that they fled out of the hou&s;e naked and wounded."</P>
<P>The <HI>la&s;t</HI> precedent for &s;wearing that I &s;hall men|tion, is the one related in Acts xxiii.21&s;t. It con|tains an account of forty men who had bound them|&s;elves, by <HI>an oath,</HI> not to eat or drink, until they had killed St. Paul. It would &s;eem that this banditti knew each other perfectly, and that they would not act together under the form of a common obligation. The occa&s;ion indeed, &s;eems to require an oath. It was an a&s;&s;ociation to commit murder. I am di&s;po&s;|ed to &s;u&s;pect that oaths were introduced originally to compel men to do things that were contrary to ju&s;tice, or to their con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>In mentioning the precepts and precedents that are to be found in the new te&s;tament again&s;t &s;wear|ing, the following &s;triking pa&s;&s;age, taken from Matthew v. ver&s;es 34, 35, 36, 37, &s;hould alone determine the que&s;tion. "Swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne; nor by the earth, for it is his foot&s;tool; nor by Jeru&s;alem, for it is the city of the
<PB N="130" REF="034495_0136_0FFE01F59FDC7A98">
great king. Neither &s;halt thou &s;wear by thy head, becau&s;e thou can&s;t not make one hair white or black But let your communication be yea, yea; nay, nay; for what&s;oever is more than the&s;e, cometh of evil."</P>
<P>The words of the apo&s;tle James, are equally pointed again&s;t &s;wearing, chap. v.12. "But above all things my brethren, &s;wear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath; but let your yea, be yea, and your nay, nay; le&s;t ye fall into condemna|tion."</P>
<P>I know, the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are &s;aid to be levelled only again&s;t profane &s;wearing in common conver&s;ation, but this will appear improbable when we reflect, that our Saviour's words were addre&s;&s;ed exclu&s;ively to his di&s;|ciples, and that the epi&s;tle of St. James, from whence the prohibition of &s;wearing is taken, is directed to a number of pious converts to chri&s;tianity, none of whom, any more than the di&s;ciples of our Lord, could be &s;u&s;pected of profane &s;wearing in common conver|&s;ation. Both pa&s;&s;ages equally condemn oaths of every kind, and demon&s;trate their contrariety to the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>There is a peculiar meaning in the rea&s;on which is given for the prohibition of &s;wearing in the pre|cept, of our Saviour, viz. that any thing more than a bare affirmation, <HI>cometh of evil.</HI> Yes, it came originally from the univer&s;al prevalance of fal&s;ehood in &s;ociety; but the chri&s;tian religion, by opening new &s;ources of
<PB N="131" REF="034495_0137_0FFE01F784A32628">
moral and religious obligation, and by di&s;covering more fully the beauty and rewards of truth and deformity, and future puni&s;hment of fal&s;ehood, has rendered the obligation of oaths wholly unnece&s;&s;ary. They com|port<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">d with the feeble di&s;coveries of the Jewi&s;h, and the numerous corruptions of the pagan religions; but they are unnece&s;&s;ary under that full and clear manifes|tation of the divine will which is contained in the go&s;pel. Cae&s;ar's wife &s;hould not be &s;u&s;pected.&mdash;With how much more propriety &s;hould this be &s;aid of the veracity of a chri&s;tian, than of the cha&s;tity of the wife of a heathen emperor. Every time a chri&s;tian &s;wears, he expo&s;es the purity and truth of his religion to &s;u&s;picion. "As for you, Petrarch, your word is &s;ufficient," &s;aid the cardinal Colonna, in an enquiry into the cau&s;e of a riot that had happened in his fami|ly, while that celebrated poet was a member of it; and in which he exacted an oath from every other member of his family, not excepting his own brother, the bi&s;hop of Luna. The &s;ame addre&s;s &s;hould be made to every chri&s;tian, when he is called upon to declare the truth. "You believe in a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hment&mdash;you profe&s;s to be the follower of that Being who has inculcated a regard for truth, under the awful con&s;ideration of his omni&s;cience, and who has emphatically &s;tyled him&s;elf the TRUTH." <HI>Your word, therefore is &s;ufficient.</HI></P>
<P>A nobleman is permitted, by the laws of England, to declare the truth upon his <HI>honour.</HI> The profe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="132" REF="034495_0138_0FFE01FCB3E71818">
of chri&s;tianity is declared in &s;cripture to be an high calling, and chri&s;tians are &s;aid to be <HI>prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>kings.</HI> Strange! that per&s;ons of &s;uch high rank, &s;hould be treated with le&s;s re&s;pect than Engli&s;h noblemen; and &s;till more &s;trange! that per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the&s;e augu&s;t titles &s;hould betray their illu&s;trious birth and dignity, by conforming to a practice which tends &s;o much to invalidate the truth and excellency of their re|ligion.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that in all the accounts we have of the intercour&s;e of our Saviour with his di&s;|ciples, and of their &s;ub&s;equent intercour&s;e with each other, there is no mention made of a &s;ingle oath being taken by either of them.</P>
<P>Perhaps there never was an event in which the highe&s;t degrees of evidence were more nece&s;&s;ary, than they were to e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of the re&s;urrection of our Saviour, as on the truth of this miracle depen|ded the credibility of the chri&s;tian religion. But in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the truth of this great event, no oath is taken, or required. The witne&s;&s;es of it &s;imply relate what they &s;aw, and are believed by all the di&s;ciples except one, who &s;till remembered too well the prohibition of his ma&s;ter, "&s;wear not at all," to a&s;k for an oath to remove his unbelief.</P>
<P>It is worthy of notice likewi&s;e, that no prepo&s;terous oath of office is required of the di&s;ciples when they a&s;&s;ume the apo&s;tolic character, and are &s;ent forth to
<PB N="133" REF="034495_0139_0FFE01FE4117E458">
preach the go&s;pel to all nations. How unlike the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel are tho&s;e human con&s;titutions and laws, which require oaths of fidelity, every year! and which appear to be founded in the ab&s;urd idea that men are at all times the guardians of their own virtue.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt of chri&s;tians having uniform|ly refu&s;ed to take an oath in the fir&s;t ages of the church: nor did they conform to this pagan cu&s;tom, till after chri&s;tianity was corrupted by a mixture with many other parts of the pagan and Jewi&s;h religions.</P>
<P>There are two arguments in favour of oaths which are derived from the new te&s;tament, and which remain to be refuted.&mdash;1&s;t St. Paul u&s;es &s;everal ex|pre&s;&s;ions in his epi&s;tles which amount to oaths, and even declares "an oath to be the end of &s;trife." It was the character of St. Paul, that he became all things to all men. He circumci&s;ed as well as baptized Jews, and he proves the truth of revelation by a quota|tion from a heathen poet. Oaths were a part of the Jewi&s;h and pagan in&s;titutions&mdash;and, like &s;everal other ceremonies, for &s;ome time, continued to retain a &s;trong hold of the prejudices of the new converts to chri&s;tianity. But the above words of the Apo&s;tle, which have been urged in favor of &s;wearing, are by no means intended to apply to common life. They have a retro&s;pect to the promi&s;e made to Abraham of the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, and were de&s;igned to &s;hew the
<PB N="134" REF="034495_0140_0FFE01FFC9CA0EC8">
certainty of that event in a language which was accom|modated to the idea of the Jewi&s;h nation.</P>
<P N="2">2d. It has beeen &s;aid, that the great Jehovah frequently &s;wears, both in the old and new te&s;tament, and that the angel who is to &s;ound the la&s;t trumpet will "&s;wear that time &s;hall be no more." Every expre&s;&s;i|on of this kind &s;hould be con&s;idered as an accomodation to Jewi&s;h and pagan cu&s;toms, in order to render the truths of revelation more intelligible and acceptable. The Supreme Being, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, often a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf the violent pa&s;&s;ions, and even the features and &s;en&s;es of men; and yet who can &s;uppo&s;e it proper to a&s;cribe either of them to a Being, one of who&s;e perfections con&s;i&s;ts in his exi&s;ting as a pure unchangeable &s;pirit.</P>
<P>If oaths are contrary to rea&s;on, and have a pernicious influence upon morals and the order of &s;ociety; and above all, if they are contrary to the precepts and &s;pirit of the go&s;pel; it becomes legi&s;lators and minis|ters of the go&s;pel to con&s;ider how far they are re&s;pon&s;i|ble for all the fal&s;ehood, profane &s;wearing and perjury that exi&s;t in &s;ociety. It is in the power of legi&s;lators to aboli&s;h oaths, by expunging them from our laws; and it is in the power of mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, by their influence and example, to render truth &s;o &s;imple and obligatory, that human governments &s;hall be a&s;hamed to a&s;k any other mode of declaring it, from <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> than by a bare affirmation.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="034495_0141_0FFE0202919918B0">The friends of virtue and freedom have beheld, with great plea&s;ure, a new con&s;titution e&s;tabli&s;hed in the United States, who&s;e objects are <HI>peace, union</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI> It will be in the power of the fir&s;t congre&s;s that &s;hall act under this con&s;titution, to &s;et the world an example of enlightened policy, by framing laws that &s;hall command obedience without the ab&s;urd and improper obligation of oaths. By this means they will add the re&s;toration and e&s;tabli&s;hment of TRUTH, to the great and valuable objects of the con&s;titution that have been mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY INTO THE EFFECTS OF PUBLIC PU|NISHMENTS UPON CRIMINALS, AND UPON SOCIETY. READ IN THE SOCIETY FOR PROMOTING POLITI|CAL ENQUIRIES, CONVENED AT THE HOUSE OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, ESQ. IN PHILADELPHIA, MARCH 9th, 1787.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>Accu&s;tomed to look up to tho&s;e nations from whom we have derived our origin, for our laws, our opinions, and our manners; we have re|tained, with undi&s;tingui&s;hing reverence, their errors, with their im|provements; have blended, with our public in&s;titutions, the policy of di&s;&s;imilar countries; and have grafted, on an infant commonwealth, the manners of ancient and corrupted monarchies.</P>
<BIBL>PREFACE TO THE LAWS OF THE SOCIETY FOR POLITICAL ENQUIRIES.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE de&s;ign of puni&s;hment is &s;aid to be, 1&s;t, to reform the per&s;on who &s;uffers it; 2dly, to prevent the perpetration of crimes, by exciting ter|ror in the minds of &s;pectators; and, 3dly, to remove tho&s;e per&s;ons from &s;ociety, who have manife&s;ted, by their tempers and crimes, that they are unfit to live in it.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t in&s;titution of governments, in every age and country (with but a few exceptions) legi&s;la|tors have thought that puni&s;hments &s;hould be <HI>public,</HI> in order to an&s;wer the two fir&s;t of the&s;e intentions. It will require &s;ome fortitude to combat opinions that have been &s;anctified by &s;uch long and general preju|dice,
<PB N="137" REF="034495_0143_0FFE02094C3BD600">
and &s;upported by univer&s;al practice. But truth in government, as well as in philo&s;ophy, is of pro|gre&s;&s;ive growth. As in philo&s;ophy, we often arrive at truth by rejecting the evidence of our &s;en&s;es; &s;o in government, we often arrive at it, after divorcing our fir&s;t thoughts. Rea&s;on, though depo&s;ed and op|pre&s;&s;ed, is the only ju&s;t &s;overeign of the human mind. Di&s;coveries, it is true, have been made by accident; but they have derived their credit and u&s;efulne&s;s only from their according with the deci&s;ions of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>In medicine, above every other branch of philo&s;ophy, we perceive many in&s;tances of the want of relation between the apparent cau&s;e and effect. Who, by rea&s;oning <HI>a priori,</HI> would &s;uppo&s;e, that the hot regimen was not preferable to the cold, in the treatment of the &s;mall-pox? But experience teaches us, that this is not the ca&s;e. Cau&s;e and effect appear to be rela|ted in philo&s;ophy, like the objects of chemi&s;try. Simi|lar bodies often repel each other, while bodies that are di&s;&s;imilar in figure, weight and quality, often unite together with impetuo&s;ity. With our pre&s;ent imperfect degrees of knowledge of the properties of bodies, we can di&s;cover the&s;e chemical relations only by experiment. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the connec|tion between <HI>cau&s;e</HI> and <HI>effect,</HI> in many parts of govern|ment. This connection often accords with rea&s;on, while it is repugnant to our &s;en&s;es&mdash;and when this is not the ca&s;e, from our inability to perceive it, it forces
<PB N="138" REF="034495_0144_0FFE020AD5ACD400">
our con&s;ent from the te&s;timony of experience and ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>It has been remarked, that the profe&s;&s;ion of arms owes its pre&s;ent rank, as a &s;cience, to its having been re&s;cued, &s;ince the revival of letters, from the hands of mere &s;oldiers, and cultivated by men acquainted with other branches of literature. The rea&s;on of this is plain. Truth is an unit. It is the &s;ame thing in war&mdash;philo|&s;ophy&mdash;medicine&mdash;morals&mdash;religion and government; and in proportion as we arrive at it in one &s;cience, we &s;hall di&s;cover it in others.</P>
<P>After this apology, for di&s;&s;enting from the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed opinions and practice, upon the &s;ubject of public puni&s;hments, I &s;hall take the liberty of declaring, that the great ends propo&s;ed, are not to be obtained by them; and that, on the contrary, all <HI>public</HI> puni&s;hments tend to make bad men wor&s;e, and to increa&s;e crimes, by their influence upon &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="1">I. The reformation of a criminal can never be ef|fected by a public puni&s;hment, for the following rea|&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. As it is always connected with infamy, it de|&s;troys in him the &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, which is one of the &s;tronge&s;t out-po&s;ts of virtue.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It is generally of &s;uch &s;hort duration, as to produce none of tho&s;e changes in body or mind, which are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to reform ob&s;tinate habits of vice.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="139" REF="034495_0145_0FFE020D99BD3FA8">3dly. Experience proves, that public puni&s;hments have increa&s;ed propen&s;ities to crimes. A man who has lo&s;t his character at a whipping po&s;t, has nothing va|luable left to lo&s;e in &s;ociety. Pain has begotten in&s;en|&s;ibility to the whip; and infamy to &s;hame. Added to his old habits of vice, he probably feels a &s;pirit of re|venge again&s;t the whole community, who&s;e laws have inflicted his puni&s;hment upon him; and hence he is &s;ti|mulated to add to the number and enormity of his out|rages upon &s;ociety. The long duration of the puni&s;h|ment, when public, by increa&s;ing its infamy, &s;erves on|ly to increa&s;e the evils that have been mentioned. The criminals, who were &s;entenced to work in the pre&s;ence of the City of London, upon the Thames, during the late war, were prepared by it, for the perpetration of every crime, as &s;oon as they were &s;et at liberty from their confinement. I proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;hew, that public puni&s;hments, &s;o far from preventing crimes by the terror they excite in the minds of &s;pectators, are directly calculated to produce them.</P>
<P>All men, when they &s;uffer, di&s;cover either fortitude, in&s;en&s;ibility, or di&s;tre&s;s. Let us inquire into the effects of each of the&s;e upon the minds of &s;pectators.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Fortitude is a virtue, that &s;eizes &s;o forcible upon our e&s;teem, that wherever we &s;ee it, it never fails to weaken, or to obliterate, our dete&s;tation of the crimes with which it is connected in criminals.
<Q>I call upon
<PB N="140" REF="034495_0146_0FFE0212DBAC3698">
you,</Q>
&s;aid major Andre, at the place of execution to his attendants
<Q>to bear witne&s;s, gentlemen, that I die like a brave man.</Q>
The effect of this &s;peech upon the American army is well known. The &s;py was lo&s;t in the hero: and indignation, every where, gave way to admiration and prai&s;e. But this is not all: the admiration, which fortitude, under &s;uffering, excites, has in &s;ome in&s;tances excited envy. In Den|mark uncommon pains are taken to prepare criminals for death, by the conver&s;ation and in&s;tructions of the clergy. After this, they are conducted to the place of execution with uncommon pomp and &s;olemnity. The criminals, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, &s;uffer death with meekne&s;s&mdash;piety&mdash;and &s;ometimes with dignity. The&s;e effects of this, I have been well informed have been, in &s;everal in&s;tances, to induce deluded people to feign or confe&s;s crimes, which they had never com|mitted, on purpo&s;e to &s;ecure to them&s;elves a con&s;pi|cuous death, and a certain entrance into happine&s;s. There is &s;omething in the pre&s;ence of a number of &s;pectators, which is calculated to excite and &s;trength|en fortitude in a &s;ufferer. "It is not &s;o difficult a thing," &s;aid Lewis XIV. to his courtiers, who &s;tood round his death-bed, "to die, as I expected."
<Q>No wonder,</Q>
&s;ays Voltaire, who relates this anecdote, "for all men die with fortitude, who die in company." The bravery of &s;oldiers is derived in a great degree, from the operation of this principle in the human mind.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="141" REF="034495_0147_0FFE021463945660">2dly. If criminals di&s;cover in&s;en&s;ibility under their puni&s;hments, the effect of it mu&s;t be &s;till more fatal upon &s;ociety. It removes, in&s;tead of exciting terror. In &s;ome in&s;tances, I conceive it may excite a de&s;ire in the minds of per&s;ons whom debt or &s;ecret guilt has made mi&s;erable, to &s;eek an end of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es in the &s;ame enviable apathy to evil. Should this in&s;en|&s;ibility be connected with chearfulne&s;s, which is &s;ome|times the ca&s;e, it mu&s;t produce &s;till more unfriendly effects upon &s;ociety. But terrible mu&s;t be the con|&s;equence of this in&s;en&s;ibility and chearfulne&s;s, if they &s;hould lead criminals to retaliate upon the inhuman curio&s;ity of &s;pectators, by profane or indecent in&s;ults or conver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The effects of di&s;tre&s;s in criminals, though le&s;s obvious are not le&s;s injurious to &s;ociety, than forti|tude or in&s;en&s;ibility. By an immutable law of our nature, di&s;tre&s;s of all kinds, when <HI>&s;een,</HI> produces &s;ympa|thy, and a di&s;po&s;ition to relieve it. This &s;ympathy, in generous minds, is not le&s;&s;ened by the di&s;tre&s;s being the offspring of crimes: on the contrary, even the crimes them&s;elves are often palliated by the reflection that they were the unfortunate con&s;equences of extreme poverty&mdash;of &s;educing company&mdash;or of the want of a virtuous education, from the lo&s;s or negligence of parents in early life. Now, as the di&s;tre&s;s which the criminals &s;uffer, is the effect of a law of the &s;tate, which cannot be re&s;i&s;ted, the &s;ympathy of the &s;pec|tator is rendered abortive, and returns empty to the
<PB N="142" REF="034495_0148_0FFE0215EB971690">
bo&s;om in which it was awakened. Let us briefly examine the con&s;equences of this abortive &s;ympathy in &s;ociety. It will not be nece&s;&s;ary here to dwell upon all the advantages of this principle in human nature. It will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that it is the vicegerent of the divine benevolence in our world. It is intended to bind up all the wounds which &s;in and death have made among mankind. It has foun|ded ho&s;pitals&mdash;erected charity-&s;chools&mdash;and connected the extremes of happine&s;s and mi&s;ery together in every part of the globe. Above all, &s;en&s;ibility is the centi|nel of the moral faculty. It decides upon the quality of the actions before they reach that divine principle of the &s;oul. It is of it&s;elf, to u&s;e the words of an elegant female poet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;. Moore.</NOTE>,
<Q>"A ha&s;ty moral&mdash;a &s;udden &s;en&s;e of right."</Q></P>
<P>If &s;uch are the advantages of &s;en&s;ibility, now what mu&s;t be the con&s;equences to &s;ociety, of extirpating or weakening it in the human brea&s;t? But public puni&s;h|ments are calculated to produce this effect. To prove this, I mu&s;t borrow an analogy from the animal oeconomy.&mdash;The &s;en&s;ibility of the human body is &s;aid to be <HI>active</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ive.</HI> The fir&s;t is connected with motion and &s;en&s;ation; the &s;econd only with &s;en&s;ation, The fir&s;t is increa&s;ed, the &s;econd is dimini&s;hed, by the repetition of impre&s;&s;ions. The &s;ame phaenomena take place in the human mind. Sen&s;ibility here is both <HI>active</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ive.</HI> Pa&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility is le&s;&s;ened, while that which
<PB N="143" REF="034495_0149_0FFE0218AFC7E730">
is active is increa&s;ed by habit. The pa&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility of a phy&s;ician, to the di&s;tre&s;s of his patients, is al|ways, dimini&s;hed, but his active &s;en&s;ibility is always increa&s;ed by time; hence we find young phy&s;icians <HI>feel</HI> mo&s;t&mdash; but old phy&s;icians, with le&s;s feeling, <HI>di&s;|cover</HI> mo&s;t &s;ympathy with their patients.</P>
<P>If &s;uch be the con&s;titution of our minds, then the effects, of di&s;tre&s;s upon them will be, not only to de&s;|troy pa&s;&s;ive, but to eradicate active &s;en&s;ibility from them. The principle of &s;ympathy, after being often oppo&s;ed by the law of the &s;tate, which forbids it to relieve the di&s;tre&s;s it commi&s;erates, will cea&s;e to act altogether; and, from this defect of action, and the habit ari&s;ing from it, will &s;oon lo&s;e its place in the human brea&s;t. Mi&s;ery of every kind will then be contemplated without emotion or &s;ympathy.&mdash;The widow and the orphan&mdash;the naked&mdash;the &s;ick, and the pri&s;oner, will have no avenue to our &s;ervices or our charity&mdash;and what is wor&s;e than all, when the cen|tinel of our moral faculty is removed, there is no|thing to guard the mind from the inroads of every po&s;itive vice.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s over the influence of this &s;ympathy in its fir&s;t operation upon the government of the &s;tate. While we pity, we &s;ecretly condemn the law which inflicts the puni&s;hment: hence, ari&s;es a want of re&s;pect for was in general, and a more feeble union of the great ties of government.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="034495_0150_0FFE021DE7C30038">I have only to add, upon this part of my &s;ubject, that the pernicious effects of &s;ympathy, where it does not terminate in action, are happily provided again&s;t by the Jewi&s;h law. Hence we read of a prohibition again&s;t it where per&s;ons &s;uffer for certain crimes. To &s;pectators, the voice of heaven, under &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces, is, "thine eye &s;hall not pity him."</P>
<P N="4">4thly. But it is po&s;&s;ible the characters or conduct of criminals may be &s;uch, as to excite indignation or contempt in&s;tead of pity, in the minds of &s;pec|tators. Let us there enquire, briefly, into the effects of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions upon the human mind. Every body acknowledges our obligations to univer&s;al benevo|lence; but the&s;e cannot be fulfilled, unle&s;s we love the whole human race, however diver&s;ified they may be by weakne&s;s or crimes. The indignation or con|tempt which is felt for this unhappy part of the great family of mankind, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily extingui&s;h a large; portion of this univer&s;al love. Nor is this all the men, or perhaps the women who&s;e per&s;ons we dete&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ouls and bodies compo&s;ed of the &s;ame materials as tho&s;e of our friends and relations. They are bone of their bone; and were originally fa&s;hioned with the &s;ame &s;pirits. What, then, mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of a familiarity with &s;uch objects of horror, upon our attachments and duties to our friends and connections, or to the re&s;t of mankind? If a &s;pectator &s;hould give him&s;elf time to reflect upon &s;uch a &s;ight of human depravity, he would naturally
<PB N="145" REF="034495_0151_0FFE021F6F9BCA38">
recoil from the embraces of friend&s;hip, and the endear|ments of dome&s;tic life, and perhaps &s;ay with an unfor|tunate great man, after having experienced an in&s;tance of treachery in a friend,
<Q>Oh! that I were a dog, that I might not call man my brother.</Q>
The Jewi&s;h law forbade more than nine and thirty la&s;hes, le&s;t the &s;ufferer &s;hould afterwards become "vile" in the &s;ight of &s;pectators. It is the prerogative of God alone, to contemplate the vices of bad men, without withdrawing from them the &s;upport of his benevolence. Hence we find, when he appeared in the world, in the per&s;on of his Son, he did not exclude criminals from the benefits of his goodne&s;s. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed a women caught in the perpetration of a crime, which was capital by the Jewi&s;h law, with a friendly admoni|tion: and he opened the gates of paradi&s;e to a dying thief.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. But let us &s;uppo&s;e, that criminals are viewed without &s;ympathy&mdash;indignation&mdash;or contempt.&mdash;This will be the ca&s;e, either when the &s;pectators are them|&s;elves hardened with vice, or when they are too young, or too ignorant, to connect the ideas of crimes and puni&s;hments together. Here, then, a new &s;ource of injury ari&s;es from the public nature of puni&s;hments. Every portion of them will appear, to &s;pectators of this de&s;cription, to be mere arbitrary acts of cruelty: hence will ari&s;e a di&s;po&s;ition to exerci&s;e the &s;ame arbitrary cruelty over the feelings and lives of their fellow creatures. To &s;ee blows, or a halter, impo&s;ed
<PB N="146" REF="034495_0152_0FFE0220F8478C08">
in cold blood upon a criminal, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ive behaviour, operating with the ignorance of the &s;pecta|tors, indicates innocence more than vice, cannot fail of removing the natural ob&s;tacles to violence and mur|der in the human mind.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. Public puni&s;hments make many crimes known to per&s;ons who would otherwi&s;e have pa&s;&s;ed through life in a total ignorance of them. They moreover produce &s;uch a familiarity, in the minds of &s;pectators, with the crimes for which they are inflicted, that, in &s;ome in&s;tances, they have been known to excite a propen&s;ity for them. It has been remarked, that a certain immorality has always kept pace with pub|lic admonitions in the churches in the ea&s;tern &s;tates. In proportion as this branch of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline has declined, fewer children have been born out of wedlock.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. Ignominy is univer&s;ally acknowledged to be a wor&s;e puni&s;hment than death. Let it not be &s;up|po&s;ed, from this circum&s;tance, that it operates more than the fear of death in preventing crimes. On the contrary, like the indi&s;criminate puni&s;hment of death, it not only confounds and levels all crimes, but by increa&s;ing the di&s;proportion between crimes and puni&s;h|ments, it creates a hatred of all law and govern|ment; and thus di&s;po&s;es to the perpetration of every crime. Laws can only be re&s;pected and obeyed, while they bear an exact proportion to crimes.&mdash;The law
<PB N="147" REF="034495_0153_0FFE0223BA6D8CD0">
which puni&s;hes the &s;hooting of a &s;wan with death, in England, has produced a thou&s;and murders. Nor is this all the mi&s;chievous influence, which the puni&s;h|ment of ignominy has upon &s;ociety. While murder is puni&s;hed with death, the man who robs on the high-way, or breaks open a hou&s;e, mu&s;t want the common feelings and principles which belong to human nature, if he does not add murder to theft, in order to &s;creen him&s;elf, if he &s;hould be detected, from that puni&s;hment which is acknowledged to be more terrible than death.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem &s;trange, that ignominy &s;hould ever have been adopted, as a milder puni&s;hment than death, did we not know that the human mind &s;eldom arrives at truth upon any &s;ubject, till it has fir&s;t reached the extremity of error.</P>
<P N="8">8thly. But may not the benefit derived to &s;ociety, by employing criminals to repair public roads, or to clean &s;treets, overbalance the evils that have been mentioned? I an&s;wer, by no means. On the contra|ry, be&s;ides operating in <HI>one,</HI> or in <HI>all</HI> the ways that have been de&s;cribed, the practice of employing criminals in public labour, will render labour of every kind di&s;re|putable, more e&s;pecially that &s;pecies of it, which has for its objects the convenience or improvement of the &s;tate. It is a well-known fact, that white men &s;oon decline labour in the We&s;t Indies, and in the &s;outhern &s;tates, only becau&s;e the agriculture, and mechanical
<PB N="148" REF="034495_0154_0FFE0228F7700C10">
employments of tho&s;e countries, are carried on chiefly by negro &s;laves. But I object further to the employ|ment of criminals on the high-ways and &s;treets, from the idlene&s;s it will create, by alluring &s;pectators from their bu&s;ine&s;s, and thereby depriving the &s;tate of great|er benefits from the indu&s;try of its citizens, than it can ever derive from the labour of criminals.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of public puni&s;hments, in every age and country, is full of facts, which &s;upport every principle that has been advanced. What has been the operation of the &s;eventy thou&s;and executions, that have taken place in Great Britain from the year 1688, to the pre|&s;ent day, upon the morals and manners of the inhabi|tants of that i&s;land? Has not every pri&s;on-door that has been opened, to conduct criminals to public &s;hame and puni&s;hment, unlocked, at the &s;ame time, the bars of moral obligation upon the minds of ten times the num|ber of people? How often do we find pockets picked under a gallows, and highway robberies committed in &s;ight of a gibbet? From whence aro&s;e the con&s;pira|cies, with a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations and poi&s;onings, which prevailed in the decline of the Roman empire? Were they not favoured by the public executions of the amphitheatre? It is therefore to the combined operation of indolence, prejudice, ignorance and the defect of culture of the human heart, alone, that we are to a&s;cribe the conti|nuance of public puni&s;hments, after &s;uch long and mul|tiplied experience of their inefficacy to reform bad men, or to prevent the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="149" REF="034495_0155_0FFE022A84BCA968">III. Let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, from any thing that has been &s;aid, that I wi&s;h to aboli&s;h puni&s;hments. Far from it: I wi&s;h only to change the place and manner of inflicting them, &s;o as to render them effectual for the reformation of criminals, and beneficial to &s;ociety. Before I propo&s;e a plan for this purpo&s;e, I beg leave to deliver the following general axioms:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The human mind is di&s;po&s;ed to exaggerate every thing that is removed from it, by time or place.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It is equally di&s;po&s;ed to enquire after, and to magnify &s;uch things as are &s;acred.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. It always a&s;cribes the extremes in qualities, to things that are unknown; and an exce&s;s in duration, to indefinite time.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Certain and definite evil, by being long con|templated, cea&s;es to be dreaded or avoided. A &s;ol|dier &s;oon lo&s;es, from habit the fear of death in battle; but retains, in common with other people, the terror of death from &s;ickne&s;s or drowning.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. An attachment to kindred and &s;ociety is one of the &s;tronge&s;t feelings of the human heart .A &s;epe|paration from them, therefore has ever been con&s;ider|ed as one of the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hments that can be in|flicted upon man.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="150" REF="034495_0156_0FFE022C10788998">6thly. Per&s;onal liberty is &s;o dear to all men, that the lo&s;s of it, for an indefinite time, is a puni&s;h|ment &s;o &s;evere, that death has often been preferred to it.</P>
<P>The&s;e axioms being admitted (for they cannot be controverted) I &s;hall proceed next to apply them, by &s;ugge&s;ting a plan for the puni&s;hment of crimes, which, I flatter my&s;elf, will an&s;wer all the ends that have been propo&s;ed by them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let a large hou&s;e be erected in a convenient part of the &s;tate. Let it be divided into a number of apart|ments, re&s;erving one large room for public wor&s;hip. Let cells be provided for the &s;olitary confinement of &s;uch per&s;ons as are of a refractory temper. Let the hou&s;e be &s;upplied with the materials, and in&s;truments for carrying on &s;uch manufactures as can be con|ducted with the lea&s;t in&s;truction, or previous know|ledge. Let a garden adjoin this hou&s;e, in which the culprits may occa&s;ionally work, and walk. This &s;pot will have a beneficial effect not only upon health, but morals, for it will lead them to a familiarity with tho&s;e pure and natural objects which are calculated to renew the connection of fallen man with his creator. Let the name of this hou&s;e convey an idea of its bene|volent and &s;alutary de&s;ign, but let it by no means be cal|led a pri&s;on, or by ony other name that is a&s;&s;ociated with what is infamous in the opinion of mankind. Let the direction of this in&s;titution be committed to
<PB N="151" REF="034495_0157_0FFE022ED3F16C48">
per&s;ons of e&s;tabli&s;hed characters for probity, di&s;cretion and humanity, who &s;hall be amenable at all times to the legi&s;lature, or courts of the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Let the various kinds of puni&s;hment, that are to be inflicted on crimes, be defined and fixed by law. But let no notice be taken, in the law, of the puni&s;h|ment that awaits any particular crime. By the&s;e means, we &s;hall prevent the mind from accu&s;toming it&s;elf to the view of the&s;e puni&s;hmeats, &s;o as to de&s;troy their terror by habit. The indifference and levity with which &s;ome men &s;uffer the puni&s;hment of hanging, is often occa&s;ioned by an in&s;en&s;ibility which is contrac|ted by the frequent anticipation of it, or by the appear|ance of the gallows &s;ugge&s;ting the remembrance of &s;cenes of criminal fe&s;tivity, in which it was the &s;ubject of humour or ridicule. Be&s;ides, puni&s;hments &s;hould always be varied in degree, according to the temper of criminals, or the progre&s;s of their reformation.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Let the duration of puni&s;hments, for all crimes be limitted: but let this limitation be unknown I conceive this &s;ecret to be of the utmo&s;t importance in reforming criminals, and preventing crimes. The imagination, when agitated with uncertainty, will &s;el|dom fail of connecting the longe&s;t duration of pu|ni&s;hment, with the &s;malle&s;t crime.</P>
<P>I cannot conceive any think more calculated to dif|fu&s;e terror through a community, and thereby to
<PB N="152" REF="034495_0158_0FFE02340614B788">
prevent crimes, than the combination of the three cir|cum&s;tances that have been mentioned in puni&s;hments. Children will pre&s;s upon the evening fire in li&s;tening to the tales that will be &s;pread from this abode of mi&s;ery. Super&s;tition will add to its horrors: and ro|mance will find in it ample materials for fiction, which cannot fail of increa&s;ing the terror of its puni&s;hments,</P>
<P>Let it not be objected, that the terror produced by the hi&s;tory of the&s;e &s;ecret puni&s;hments, will ope|rate like the abortive &s;ympathy I have de&s;cribed. <HI>Active</HI> &s;ympathy can he fully excited only through the avenues of the eyes and the ears. Be&s;ides, the recollection that the only de&s;ign of puni&s;hment is the reformation of the criminal will &s;u&s;pend the action of &s;ympathy altogether. We li&s;ten with palene&s;s to the hi&s;tory of a tedious and painful operation in &s;ur|gery, without a wi&s;h to arre&s;t the hand of the ope|rator. Our &s;ympathy, which in this ca&s;e is of the <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> kind, is mixed with plea&s;ure, when we are a&s;&s;ured, that there is a certainty of the operation being the means of &s;aving the life of the &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>Nor let the expence of erecting and &s;upporting a hou&s;e of repentance, for the purpo&s;es that have been mentioned, deter us from the undertaking. It would be ea&s;y to demon&s;trate, that it will not co&s;t one fourth as much as the maintenance of the numerous jails that are now nece&s;&s;ary in every well regulated
<PB N="153" REF="034495_0159_0FFE02358ED40D10">
&s;tate. But why &s;hould receptacles be provided and &s;upported at an immen&s;e expen&s;e, in every country, for the relief of per&s;ons afflicted with bodily di&s;or|ders, and an objection be made to providing a place for the cure of the di&s;ea&s;es of the mind?</P>
<P>The nature&mdash;degrees&mdash;and duration of the puni&s;h|ments, &s;hould all be determined beyond a certain de|gree, by a court properly con&s;tituted for that purpo&s;e, and who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it &s;hould be to vi&s;it the receptacle for criminals once or twice a year.</P>
<P>I am aware of the prejudices of freemen, again&s;t en|tru&s;ting power to a di&s;cretionary court. But let it be remembered, that no power is committed to this court, but what is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the different courts of ju&s;tice in all free countries; nor &s;o much as is now wi&s;ely and nece&s;&s;arily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;upreme and inferior courts, in the execution of the penal laws of Penn&s;ylvania. I &s;hall &s;pend no time in defending the con&s;i&s;tency of pri|vate puni&s;hments, with a &s;afe and free government. Truth, upon this &s;ubject, cannot be divided. If pub|lic puni&s;hments are injurious to criminals and to &s;oci|ety, it follows that crimes &s;hould be puni&s;hed in private, or not puni&s;hed at all. There is no alternative. The oppo&s;ition to private puni&s;hments, therefore is founded altogether in prejudice, or in ignorance of the true principles of liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="034495_0160_0FFE02371762C548">The &s;afety and advantages of private puni&s;hments, will appear, further, when I add, that the be&s;t governed families and &s;chools are tho&s;e, in which the faults of &s;ervants and children are rebuked privately, and where confinement and &s;olitude are preferred for correction, to the u&s;e of the rod.</P>
<P>In order to render the&s;e puni&s;hments effectual, they &s;hould be accommodated to the con&s;titutions and tempers of the criminals, and the peculiar nature of their crimes. Peculiar attention &s;hould be paid, like|wi&s;e, in the nature, degrees, and duration of puni&s;h|ments, to crimes, as they ari&s;e from pa&s;&s;ion, habit or temptation.</P>
<P>The puni&s;hments, &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of bodily pain, la|bour, watchfulne&s;s, &s;olitude, and &s;ilence. They &s;hould all be joined with cleanline&s;s and a &s;imple diet. To a&s;certain the nature, degrees, and duration of the bodily pain, will require &s;ome knowledge of the principles of &s;en&s;ation, and of the &s;ympathies which occur in the nervous &s;y&s;tem. The labour &s;hould be &s;o regula|ted and directed, as to be profitable to the &s;tate. Be&s;ides employing criminals in laborious and u&s;eful manufac|tures, they may be compelled to derive all their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance from a farm and a garden, cultivated by their own hands, adjoining the place of their confine|ment.</P>
<P>The&s;e puni&s;hments may be u&s;ed &s;eparately, or more or le&s;s combined, according to the nature of the crimes,
<PB N="155" REF="034495_0161_0FFE0239DCA03388">
or according to the variations of the con&s;titution and temper of the criminals. In the application of them, the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible advantages &s;hould be taken of the laws of the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, of habit, and of imi|tation.</P>
<P>To render the&s;e phy&s;ical remedies more effectual they &s;hould be accompanied by regular in&s;truction in the principles and obligations of religion, by per&s;ons appointed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus far I am &s;upported, in the application of the remedies I have mentioned, for the cure of crimes, by the facts contained in Mr. Howard's hi&s;tory of pri&s;ons, and by other ob&s;ervations. It remains yet to pre&s;cribe the <HI>&s;pecific</HI> puni&s;hment that is proper for each <HI>&s;pecific</HI> crime. Here my &s;ubject begins to oppre&s;s me. I have no more doubt of every crime having its cure in moral and phy&s;ical influence, than I have of the efficacy of the Peruvian bark in curing the in|termitting fever. The only difficulty is, to find out the proper remedy or remedies for particular vices. Mr Dufriche de Valaye, in his elaborate treati&s;e upon penal laws, has performed the office of a pioneer upon this difficult &s;ubject. He has divided crimes into cla&s;|&s;es; and has affixed puni&s;hments to each of them, in a number of ingenious tables. Some of the connec|tions he has e&s;tabli&s;hed, between crimes and puni&s;h|ments, appear to be ju&s;t. But many of his puni&s;hments are contrary to the fir&s;t principles of action in man;
<PB N="156" REF="034495_0162_0FFE023F119071D8">
and all of them are, in my opinion, improper, as far as he orders them to be inflicted in the <HI>eye</HI> of the <HI>public.</HI> His attempt, however, is laudable, and de&s;erves the prai&s;e of every friend to mankind.</P>
<P>If the invention of a machine for facilitating labour, has been repaid with the gratitude of a country, how much more will that man de&s;erve, who &s;hall invent the mo&s;t &s;peedy and effectual methods of re&s;toring the vi|cious part of mankind to virtue and happine&s;s, and of extirpating a portion of vice from the world? Happy condition of human affairs! when humanity, philo|&s;ophy and chri&s;tianity, &s;hall unite their influence to teach men, that they are brethren; and to prevent their preying any longer upon each other! Happy citizens of the United States, who&s;e governments permit them to adopt every di&s;covery in the moral or intellectual world, that leads to the&s;e benevolent purpo&s;es!</P>
<P>Let it not be objected, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible for men, who have expiated their offences by the mode of puni&s;hment that has been propo&s;ed, to recover their former connections with &s;ociety. This objection ari&s;es from an unfortunate a&s;&s;ociation of ideas. The infamy of criminals is derived, not &s;o much from the remem|brance of their crimes, as from the recollection of the ignominy of their puni&s;hments. Crimes produce a &s;tain, which may be wa&s;hed out by reformation, and which frequently wears away by time; but public
<PB N="157" REF="034495_0163_0FFE024099F9B438">
puni&s;hments leave &s;cars which disfigure the whole character; and hence per&s;ons, who have &s;uffered them, are ever afterwards viewed with horror or aver|&s;ion. If crimes were expiated by private di&s;cipline, and &s;ucceeded by reformation, criminals would probably &s;uffer no more in character from them, than men &s;uffer in their reputation or u&s;efulne&s;s from the puni&s;h|ments they have undergone when boys at &s;chool.</P>
<P>I am &s;o perfectly &s;atisfied of the truth of this opinion, that methinks I already hear the inhabitants of our vil|lages and town&s;hips counting the years that &s;hall com|plete the reformation of one of their citizens. I behold them running to meet him on the day of his deliverance. His friends and family bathe his cheeks with tears of joy; and the univer&s;al &s;hout of the neigbourhood is, "This our brother was lo&s;t, and is found&mdash;was dead and is alive."</P>
<P>It has long been a de&s;ideratum in government, that there &s;hould exi&s;t in it no pardoning power, &s;ince the <HI>certainty</HI> of puni&s;hment operates &s;o much more than its &s;everity, or infamy, in preventing crimes. But where puni&s;hments are exce&s;&s;ive in degree, or infamous from being public, a pardoning power is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary. Remove their &s;everity and public infamy, and a pardoning power cea&s;es to be nece&s;&s;ary in a code of criminal juri&s;prudence. Nay, further&mdash;it is &s;uch a defect in penal laws, as in &s;ome mea&s;ure defeats every invention to prevent crimes, or to cure habits of vice.
<PB N="158" REF="034495_0164_0FFE024224428050">
If puni&s;hments were moderate, ju&s;t, and private, they would exalt the feelings of public ju&s;tice and benevo|lence &s;o far above the emotions of humanity in wit|ne&s;&s;es, juries and judges, that they would forget to conceal, or to palliate crimes; and the <HI>certainty</HI> of pu|ni&s;hment, by extingui&s;hing all hope of pardon in the criminal, would lead him to connect the beginning of his repentance with the la&s;t words of his &s;entence of condemnation. To obtain this great and &s;alutary end, there &s;hould exi&s;t <HI>certain</HI> portions of puni&s;hment, both in duration and degree, which &s;hould be placed by law beyond the power of the di&s;cretionary court before mentioned, to &s;horten or mitigate.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid nothing upon the manner of in|flicting death as a puni&s;hment for crimes, becau&s;e I con&s;ider it as an improper puni&s;hment for <HI>any</HI> crime. Even murder it&s;elf is propagated by the puni&s;hment of death for murder. Of this we have a remarkable proof in Italy. The duke of Tu&s;cany &s;oon after the publication of the marquis of Beccaria's excellent treati&s;e upon this &s;ubject, aboli&s;hed death as a puni&s;h|ment for murder. A gentleman, who re&s;ided five years at Pi&s;a, informed me, that only five murders had been perpetrated in his dominions in twenty years. The &s;ame gentleman added, that after his re&s;idence in Tu&s;cany, he &s;pent three months in Rome, where death is &s;till the puni&s;hment of murder, and where executions, according to Dr. Moore, are conduct|ed with peculiar circum&s;tances of public parade. Du|ring
<PB N="159" REF="034495_0165_0FFE0244E6EF21F0">
this &s;hort period, there were &s;ixty murders com|mitted in the precincts of that city. It is remarkable, the manners, principles, and religion, of the inhabitants of Tu&s;cany and Rome, are exactly the &s;ame. The abolition of death alone, as a puni&s;hment for murder, produced this difference in the moral character of the two nations.</P>
<P>I &s;u&s;pect the attachment to death, as a puni&s;h|ment for murder, in minds otherwi&s;e enlightened, upon the &s;ubject of capital puni&s;hments, ari&s;es from a fal&s;e interpretation of a pa&s;&s;age contained in the old te&s;tament, and that is, "he that &s;heds the blood of man, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed." This has been &s;uppo&s;ed to imply that blood could only be ex|piated by blood. But I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe, with a late commentator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reverend Mr. William Turner, in the &s;econd vol. of Memoirs of the Literary and Philo&s;ophical Society of Manche&s;ter.</NOTE> upon this text of &s;cripture, that it is rather a <HI>prediction</HI> than a <HI>law.</HI> The language of it is &s;imply, that &s;uch will be the depravity and folly of man, that murder, in every age, &s;hall beget murder. Laws, therefore, which inflict death for murder, are, in my opinion, as unchri&s;tian as tho&s;e which ju&s;tify or tolerate revenge; for the obligations of chri&s;tianity upon individuals, to promote repentance, to forgive injuries, and to di&s;charge the duties of univer&s;al benevolence, are equally binding upon &s;tates.</P>
<P>The power over human life, is the &s;ole p<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ero|gative of him who gave it. Human laws, therefore,
<PB N="160" REF="034495_0166_0FFE024A20EF32B8">
ri&s;e in rebellion again&s;t this prerogative, when they transfer it to human hands.</P>
<P>If &s;ociety can be &s;ecured from violence, by confining the murderer, &s;o as to prevent a repetition of his crime, the end of extirpation will be an&s;wered. In confinement, he may be reformed: and if this &s;hould prove impracticable, he may be re&s;trained for a term of years, that will probably, be coeval with his life.</P>
<P>There was a time, when the puni&s;hment of cap|tives with death or &s;ervitude, and the indi&s;criminate de&s;truction of peaceable hu&s;bandmen, women, and children, were thought to be e&s;&s;ential, to the &s;ucce&s;s of war, and the &s;afety of &s;tates. But experience has taught us, that this is not the ca&s;e. And in propor|tion as humanity has triumphed over the&s;e maxims of fal&s;e policy, wars have been le&s;s frequent and terri|ble, and nations have enjoyed longer intervals of in|ternal tranquility. The virtues are all parts of a circle. Whatever is humane, is wi&s;e&mdash;whatever is wi&s;e, is ju&s;t&mdash;and whatever is wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and humane, will be found to be the true intere&s;t of &s;tates, whether criminals or foreign enemies are the objects of their legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>I have taken no notice of perpetual bani&s;hment, as a legal puni&s;hment, as I con&s;ider it the next in de|gree, in folly and cruelty, to the puni&s;hment of death. If the receptacle for criminals, which has been pro|po&s;ed,
<PB N="161" REF="034495_0167_0FFE024BA8D35EC8">
is erected in a remote part of the &s;tate, it will act with the &s;ame force upon the feelings of the human heart, as perpetual bani&s;hment. Exile, when perpetual, by de&s;troying one of the mo&s;t powerful prin|ciples of action in man, viz. the love of kindred and country, deprives us of all the advantages, which might be derived from it, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of reformation. While certain pa&s;&s;ions are weakened, this noble pa&s;&s;ion is &s;trengthened by age: hence, by pre&s;erving this pa&s;&s;ion alive, we furni&s;h a principle, which, in time may become an overmatch for tho&s;e vicious habits, which &s;eparated criminals from their friends and from &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this te&s;timony again&s;t the puni&s;h|ment of death and perpetual bani&s;hment, I cannot help adding, that there is more mercy to the criminal, and le&s;s injury done to &s;ociety, by both of them, than by <HI>public</HI> infamy and pain, without them.</P>
<P>The great art of &s;urgery has been &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in &s;aving, not in de&s;troying, or amputating the di&s;ea&s;ed parts of the human body. Let governments learn to imitate, in this re&s;pect, the &s;kill and humanity of the healing art. Nature knows no wa&s;te in any of her operations. Even putrefaction it&s;elf is the parent of u&s;eful productions to man. Human ingenuity imitates nature in a variety of arts. Offal maters, of all kinds, are daily converted into the means of increa&s;ing the profits of indu&s;try, and the plea&s;ures of human life.
<PB N="162" REF="034495_0168_0FFE024D32A11328">
The &s;oul of man alone, with all its moral and intel|lectual powers, when mi&s;led by pa&s;&s;ion, is abandoned, by the ignorance or cruelty of man, to unprofitable corruption, or extirpation.</P>
<P>A worthy prelate of the church of England once &s;aid upon &s;eeing a criminal led to execution, "There goes my wicked &s;elf." Con&s;idering the vices to which the frailty of human nature expo&s;es whole families of every rank and cla&s;s in life, it becomes us, whenever we &s;ee a fellow creature led to public infamy and pain, to add further. "There goes my unhappy father, my unhappy brother, or my unhappy &s;on," and afterwards to a&s;k our&s;elves, whether <HI>private</HI> puni&s;h|ments are not to be preferred to <HI>public.</HI></P>
<P>For the honour of humanity it can be &s;aid, that in every age and country, there have been found per&s;ons in whom uncorrupted nature has triumphed over cu&s;tom and law. El&s;e, why do we hear of hou&s;es being abandoned near to places of public execution? Why do we &s;ee doors and windows &s;hut on the days or hours of criminal exhibitions? Why do we hear of aid being &s;ecretly afforded to criminals, to mitigate or elude the &s;everity of their puni&s;hments? Why is the public executioner of the law an object of &s;uch general dete&s;tation? The&s;e things are latent &s;truggles of rea&s;on, or rather the &s;ecret voice of God him&s;elf, &s;peaking in the human heart, again&s;t the folly and cruelty of public puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="034495_0169_0FFE025009FDB188">I &s;hall conclude this enquiry by ob&s;erving, that the &s;ame fal&s;e religion and philo&s;ophy, which once kindled the fire on the alter of per&s;ecution, now doom the criminal to public ignominy and death. In pro|portion as the principles of philo&s;ophy and chri&s;tianity are under&s;tood, they will agree in extingui&s;hing the one, and de&s;troying the other. If the&s;e principles continue to extend their influence upon government, as they have done for &s;ome years pa&s;t, I cannot help en|tertaining a hope, that the time is not very di&s;tant, when the gallows, the pillory, the &s;tocks, the whipp|ing-po&s;t and the wheel-barrow, (the u&s;ual engines of public puni&s;hments) will be connected with the hi&s;tory of the rack and the &s;take, as marks of the barbarity of ages and countries, and as melancholy proofs of the feeble operation of rea&s;on and religion upon the human mind.</P>

<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY INTO THE CONSISTENCY OF THE PUNISH|MENT OF MURDER BY DEATH, WITH REASON AND REVELATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE Puni&s;hment of Murder by Death, is contrary to <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> and to the order and happine&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="1">1. It le&s;&s;ens the horror of taking away human life, and thereby tends to multiply murders.</P>
<P N="2">2. It produces murder by its influence upon peo|ple who are tired of life, and who, from a &s;uppo&s;ition that murder is a le&s;s crime than &s;uicide, de&s;troy a life (and often that of a near connection) and afterwards deliver them&s;elves up to the laws of their country, that they may e&s;cape from their mi&s;ery by means of a halter.</P>
<P N="3">3. The puni&s;hment of murder by death multiplies murders, from the difficulty it creates of convicting per&s;ons who are guilty of it. Humanity, revolting at the idea of the &s;everity and certainty of a capital puni&s;hment, often &s;teps in, and collects &s;uch evidence in favour of a murderer, as &s;creens him from death altogether, or palliates his crime into man&s;laughter. Even the law it&s;elf favours the acquital of a murderer
<PB N="165" REF="034495_0171_0FFE0256C56E03C0">
by making the circum&s;tance of premeditation and malice, nece&s;&s;ary to render the offence, a capital crime. Mr. Town&s;end tells us in his travels into Spain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 3.</NOTE> that &s;eventy murders were perpetrated in Malaga in the 16 months which preceeded his vi&s;it to that city, all of which e&s;caped with impunity, and pro|bably from the cau&s;es which have been mentioned. If the puni&s;hment of murder con&s;i&s;ted in long con|finement, and hard labour, it would be proportioned to the mea&s;ure of our feelings of ju&s;tice, and every member of &s;ociety would be a watchman, or a ma|gi&s;trate, to apprehend a de&s;troyer of human life, and to bring him to puni&s;hment.</P>
<P N="4">4. The puni&s;hment of murder by death checks the operations of univer&s;al ju&s;tice, by preventing the puni&s;hment of every &s;pecies of murder.</P>
<P N="5">5. The puni&s;hment of murder by death has been proved to be contrary to the order and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, by the experiments of &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t legi&s;lators in Europe. The Empre&s;s of Ru&s;ia, the King of Sweden, and the Duke of Tu&s;cany, have nearly extirpated murder from their dominions, by converting its puni&s;hments into the means of bene|fiting &s;ociety, and reforming the criminals who per|petrate it.</P>
<P N="2">II. The puni&s;hment of murder by death is con|trary to <HI>divine revelation.</HI> A religion which commands
<PB N="166" REF="034495_0172_0FFE02584ECB5A80">
us to forgive, and even to do good to, our enemies, can never authori&s;e the puni&s;hment of murder by death. "Vengence is mine," &s;aid the Lord; "I will repay." It is to no purpo&s;e to &s;ay here, that this vengeance it taken out of the hands of an indi|vidual, and directed again&s;t the criminal by the hand of government. It is equally an u&s;urpation of the prerogative of heaven, whether it be inflicted by a &s;ingle per&s;on, or by a whole community.</P>
<P>Here I expect to meet with an appeal from the letter and &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, to the law of Mo&s;es, which declares, "he that killeth a man &s;hall be put to death." Forgive, indulgent heaven! the ig|norance and cruelty of man, which, by the mi&s;ap|plication of this text of &s;cripture, has &s;o long and &s;o often &s;tained the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t with folly and revenge.</P>
<P>The following con&s;iderations, I hope, will prove that no argument can be deduced from this law, to ju&s;tify the puni&s;hment of murder by death;&mdash;on the contrary, that &s;everal arguments again&s;t it, may be derived from a ju&s;t and rational explanation of that part of the Levitical in&s;titutions.</P>
<P N="1">1. There are many things in &s;cripture above, but nothing contrary to, rea&s;on. Now, the puni&s;hment of murder by death, is contrary to rea&s;on. It cannot, therefore, be agreeable to the will of God.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="167" REF="034495_0173_0FFE025B111E89B0">2. The order and happine&s;s of &s;ociety cannot fail of being agreeable to the will of God. But the pu|ni&s;hment of murder by death, de&s;troys the order and happine&s;s of &s;ociety. It mu&s;t therefore be contrary to the will of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. Many of the laws given by Mo&s;es, were accom|modated to the ignorance, wickedne&s;s, and
<Q>hardne&s;s of heart,</Q>
of the Jews. Hence their divine legi|&s;lator expre&s;sly &s;ays,
<Q>I gave them &s;tatutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they &s;hould not live.</Q>
Of this, the law which re&s;pects divorces, and the law of retaliation, which required,
<Q>an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,</Q>
are remarkable in&s;tances.</P>
<P>But we are told, that the puni&s;hment of murder by death, is founded not only on the law of Mo&s;es, but upon a po&s;itive precept given to Noah and his po&s;te|rity, that "who&s;o &s;heddeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed," If the interpretation of this text given in a former e&s;&s;ay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry into the effects of public puni&s;hments. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">0.</NOTE> be not admitted, I &s;hall attempt to explain it by remarking, that &s;oon after the flood, the infancy and weakne&s;s of &s;ociety rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to puni&s;h murder by confinement. There was therefore no medium between inflicting death upon a murderer, and &s;uffering him to e&s;cape with impunity, and thereby to perpetrate more acts of vio|lence again&s;t his fellow creatures. It plea&s;ed God, in this condition of the world, to permit a le&s;s, in
<PB N="168" REF="034495_0174_0FFE02604DC0D7F0">
order to prevent a greater evil. He therefore commits for a while his exclu&s;ive power over human life, to his creatures for the &s;afety and pre&s;ervation of an infant &s;ociety, which might otherwi&s;e have peri&s;hed, and with it, the only &s;tock of the human race. The command indirectly implies that the crime of murder was not puni&s;hed by death in the mature &s;tate of &s;o|ciety which exi&s;ted before the flood. Nor is this the only in&s;tance upon record in the &s;criptures in which God has delegated his power over human life to his creatures. Abraham expre&s;&s;es no &s;urpri&s;e at the com|mand which God gave him to &s;acrifice his &s;on. He &s;ubmits to it as a precept founded in rea&s;on and natural ju&s;tice, for nothing could be more obvious, than that the giver of life had a right to claim it, when and in &s;uch manner as he plea&s;ed. 'Till men are able to give life, it becomes them to tremble at the thought of taking it away. Will a man rob God?&mdash;Yes&mdash;he robs him of what is infinitely dear to him&mdash;of his darling attribute of mercy, every time he deprives a fellow creature of life.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the Mo&s;aic law, with re&s;pect to murder, be obligatory upon Chri&s;tians, it follows that it is equally obligatory upon them to puni&s;h adultery, bla&s;phemy and other capital crimes that are mentioned in the Levitical law, by death. Nor is this all: it ju&s;tifies the extirpation of the Indians, and the en&s;laving of the Africans; for the command to the Jews to
<PB N="169" REF="034495_0175_0FFE0261D6125460">
de&s;troy the Canaanites, and to make &s;laves of their heathen neighbours, is as po&s;itive as the command which declares, "that he that killeth a man, &s;hall &s;urely be put to death."</P>
<P N="5">5. Every part of the Levitical law, is full of types of the Me&s;&s;iah. May not the puni&s;hment of death, inflicted by it, be intended to repre&s;ent the demerit and con&s;equences of &s;in, as the cities of refuge were the offices of the Me&s;&s;iah? And may not the enlarge|ment of murderers who had fled to tho&s;e cities of refuge, upon the death of a high prie&s;t, repre&s;ent the eternal abrogation of the law which inflicted death for murder, by the meritorious death of the Saviour of the world?</P>
<P N="6">6. The imperfection and &s;everity of the&s;e laws were probably intended farther&mdash;to illu&s;trate the per|fection and mildne&s;s of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. It is in this manner that God has manife&s;ted him&s;elf in many of his acts. He created darkne&s;s fir&s;t, to illu&s;|trate by compari&s;on the beauty of light, and he per|mits &s;in, mi&s;ery, and death in the moral world, that he may hereafter di&s;play more illu&s;triou&s;ly the ble&s;&s;ings of righteou&s;ne&s;s, happine&s;s, and immortal life. This opinion is favoured by St. Paul, who &s;ays,
<Q>the law made nothing perfect, and that it was a &s;hadow of good things to come.</Q></P>
<P>How delightful to di&s;cover &s;uch an exact harmony between the dictates of rea&s;on, the order and hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="170" REF="034495_0176_0FFE02635F052D68">
of &s;ociety, and the precepts of the go&s;pel! There is a perfect unity in truth. Upon all &s;ubjects &mdash;in all ages&mdash;and in all countries&mdash;truths of every kind agree with each other. I &s;hall now take notice of &s;ome of the common arguments, which are made u&s;e of, to defend the puni&s;hments of murder by death.</P>
<P N="1">1. It has been &s;aid, that the common &s;en&s;e of all nations, and particularly of &s;avages, is in favour of puni&s;hing murder by death.</P>
<P>The common &s;en&s;e of all nations is in favour of the commerce and &s;lavery of their fellow creatures. But this does not take away from their immorality. Could it be proved that the Indians puni&s;h murder by death, it would not e&s;tabli&s;h the right of man over the life of a fellow creature; for revenge we know in its utmo&s;t extent is the univer&s;al and darling pa&s;&s;ion of all &s;avage nations. The practice morever, (if it exi&s;t) mu&s;t have originated in <HI>nece&s;&s;ity:</HI> for a people who have no &s;ettled place of re&s;idence, and who are aver&s;e from all labour, could re&s;train murder in no other way. But I am di&s;po&s;ed to doubt whether the Indians puni&s;h murder by death among their own tribes. In all tho&s;e ca&s;es where a life is taken away by an Indian of a foreign tribe, they always demand the &s;atisfacticn of life for life. But this practice is founded on a de&s;ire of pre&s;erving a balance in their numbers and power; for among nations which con&s;i&s;t of only a few warriors, the lo&s;s of an individual
<PB N="171" REF="034495_0177_0FFE0266410ADC68">
often de&s;troys this balance, and thereby expo&s;es them to war or extermination. It is for the &s;ame purpo&s;e of keeping up an equality in numbers and power, that they often adopt captive children into their nations and families. What makes this explanation of the practice of puni&s;hing murder by death among the Indians more probable, is, that we find the &s;ame bloody and vindictive &s;atisfaction is required of a foreign nation, whether the per&s;on lo&s;t, be killed by an accident, or premeditated violence. Many facts might be mentioned from travellers to prove that the Indians do not puni&s;h murder by death within the juri&s;diction of their own tribes. I &s;hall mention only one, which is taken from the Rev. Mr. John Mega|polen&s;is's account of the Mohawk Indians, lately pub|li&s;hed in Mr Hazard's hi&s;torical collection of &s;tate pa|pers.&mdash;
<Q>There is no puni&s;hment, (&s;ays our author) here for murder, but every one is his own avenger. The friends of the decea&s;ed revenge them&s;elves upon the murderer until peace is made with the next a kin. But although they are &s;o cruel, yet there are not half &s;o many murders committed among them as among Chri&s;tians, notwith&s;tanding their &s;evere laws, and heavy penalties.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. It has been &s;aid, that the horrors of a guilty con&s;cience proclaim the ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity of death, as a puni&s;hment for murder. I draw an argument of another nature from this fact. Are the horrors of con&s;cience the puni&s;hment that God inflicts upon
<PB N="172" REF="034495_0178_0FFE026B6ECCBA68">
murder? Why, then &s;hould we &s;horten or de&s;troy them by death, e&s;pecially as we are taught to direct the mo&s;t atrocious murderers to expect pardon in the future world? No, let us not counteract the govern|ment of God in the human brea&s;t: let the murderer live&mdash;but let it be to &s;uffer the reproaches of a guilty con&s;cience; let him live, to make compen&s;ation to &s;ociety for the injury he has done it, by robbing it of a citizen; let him live to maintain the family of the man whom he has murdered; let him live, that the puni&s;hment of his crime may become univer&s;al; and, la&s;tly, let him live, that murder may be extirpated from the li&s;t of human crimes!</P>
<P>Let us examine the conduct of the moral Ruler of the world towards the fir&s;t murderer.&mdash;See Cain, returning from his field, with his hands reeking with the blood of his brother! Do the heavens gather blackne&s;s, and does a fla&s;h of lightning bla&s;t him to the earth? No. Does his father Adam, the natural legi&s;lator and judge of the world, inflict upon him the puni&s;hment of death? No. The infinitely wi&s;e God becomes his judge and executioner. He expels him from the &s;ociety of which he was a member. He fixes in his con&s;cience a never dying worm. He &s;ub|jects him to the nece&s;&s;ity of labour; and to &s;ecure a duration of his puni&s;hment, proportioned to his crime, he puts a mark of prohibition upon him, to prevent his being put to death, by weak and angry men; declaring, at the &s;ame time, that
<Q>who&s;oever &s;layeth
<PB N="173" REF="034495_0179_0FFE026CF7D65790">
Cain, vengeance &s;hall be taken on him &s;even-fold.</Q></P>
<P>But further, if a nece&s;&s;ary connection exi&s;ted be|tween the crime of murder and death in the mind and laws of the Deity, how comes it that Mo&s;es and David e&s;caped it? They both imbrued their hands in innocent blood, and yet the horrors of a guilty con|&s;cience were their only puni&s;hment, The &s;ub&s;equent conduct of tho&s;e two great and good men, proves that the heart may retain a &s;ound part after committing murder, and that even murderers, after repentance, may be the vehicles of great temporal and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings to mankind.</P>
<P N="3">3. The declaration of St. Paul before Fe&s;tus, re&s;pect|ing the puni&s;hment of death,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>For if I be an offender, and have committed any thing worthy of death, I refu&s;e not to die.</Q>

<BIBL>&mdash;Luke xxiii. and 41.</BIBL></NOTE> are &s;aid to prove the lawful|ne&s;s of puni&s;hing murder by death: but they prove only that the puni&s;hment of death was agreeable to the Roman law. Human life was extremely cheap under the Roman government. Of this we need no further proof than the head of John the Bapti&s;t forming a part of a royal entertainment. From the frequency of pub|lic executions, among tho&s;e people, the <HI>&s;word</HI> was con&s;idered as an emblem of public ju&s;tice. But to

&s;uppo&s;e, from the appeals which are &s;ometimes made to it as a &s;ign of ju&s;tice, that capital puni&s;hments are approved of in the New Te&s;tament, is as ab&s;urd as it would be to &s;uppo&s;e that hor&s;e-racing was a chri&s;tian exerci&s;e, from St. Paul's frequent allu&s;ions to the Olympic games.</P>
<P>The declaration of the barbarians upon &s;eeing the &s;nake fa&s;ten upon St. Paul's hand, proves nothing but the ignorance of tho&s;e uncivilized people;&mdash;
<Q>and when the barbarians &s;aw the venomous bea&s;t hang on his hand, they &s;aid among them&s;elves, no doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath e&s;caped the &s;ea, yet vengeance &s;uffereth not to live.</Q>
&mdash;Acts xvii. and 4th.</P>
<P>Here it will be proper to di&s;tingui&s;h between the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice &s;o univer&s;al among all nations, and an approbation of death as a puni&s;hment for murder. The former is written by the finger of God upon every human heart, but like his own attribute of ju&s;tice, it has the happine&s;s of individuals and of &s;ociety for its objects. It is always mi&s;led, when it &s;eeks for &s;atisfaction in puni&s;hments that are injurious to &s;ociety, or that are di&s;proportioned to crimes. The &s;atisfaction of this univer&s;al &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice by the puni&s;hments of impri&s;onment and labour, would far exceed that which is derived from the puni&s;hment of death; for it would be of longer duration, and it would more frequently occur; for, upon a principle
<PB N="175" REF="034495_0181_0FFE02714975A568">
formerly mentioned, &s;carcely any &s;pecies of murder would e&s;cape with impunity.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A &s;cale of puni&s;hments, by means of impri&s;onment and labour, might ea&s;ily be contrived, &s;o as to be accomodated to the different degrees of atrocity in murder. For example&mdash;for the fir&s;t or highe&s;t degree of guilt, let the puni&s;hment be &s;olitude and darkne&s;s, and a total <HI>want</HI> of employ|ment. For the &s;econd, &s;olitude and labour, with the benefit of light. For the third, confinement and labour. The <HI>duration</HI> of the&s;e puni&s;hments &s;hould likewi&s;e be governed by the atrocity of the murder, and by the &s;igns of contrition and amendment in the criminal.</NOTE></P>
<P>The conduct and di&s;cour&s;es of our Saviour &s;hould outweigh every argument that has been or can be offered in favour of capital puni&s;hment for any crime&punc; When the woman caught in adultery was brought to him, he evaded inflicting the bloody &s;entence of the Jewi&s;h law upon her Even the <HI>maiming</HI> of the body appears to be offen&s;ive in his &s;ight; for when Peter drew his &s;word, and &s;mote off the ear of the &s;ervant of the high prie&s;t, he replaced it by miracle, and at the &s;ame time declared, that
<Q>all they who take the &s;word, &s;hall peri&s;h with the &s;word.</Q>
He forgave the crime of murder, on his cro&s;s; and after his re|&s;urrection, he commanded his di&s;ciples to preach the go&s;pel of forgivene&s;s, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> at Jeru&s;alem, where he well knew his murderers &s;till re&s;ided. The&s;e &s;triking facts are recorded for our imitation, and &s;eem intended to &s;hew that the Son of God died, not only to re|concile God to man, but to reconcile men to each other. There is one pa&s;&s;age more, in the hi&s;tory of our Saviour's life which would of it&s;elf over&s;et the
<PB N="176" REF="034495_0182_0FFDC647E5BBAB00">
ju&s;tice of the puni&s;hment of death for murder, if every other part of the Bible had been &s;ilent upon the &s;ubject. When two of his di&s;ciples, actuated by the &s;pirit of vindictive legi&s;lators, reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion of him to call down fire from Heaven to con&s;ume the inho&s;pitable Samaritans, he an&s;wered them
<Q>The Son of Man is not come to <HI>de&s;troy</HI> men's <HI>lives</HI> but to &s;ave them.</Q>
I wi&s;h the&s;e words compo&s;ed the motto of the arms of every nation upon the face of the earth. They inculcate every duty that is calcula|ted to pre&s;erve, re&s;tore, or prolong human life. They militate alike again&s;t war&mdash;and capital puni&s;h|ments&mdash;the objects of which, are the unprofitable de|&s;truction of the lives of men. How precious does a human life appear from the&s;e words, in the &s;ight of heaven! Pau&s;e, Legi&s;lators, when you give your votes for inflicting the puni&s;hment of death for any crime You fru&s;trate in one in&s;tance, the de&s;ign of the mi&s;&s;ion of the Son of God into the world, and thereby either deny his appearance in the fle&s;h, or reject the truth of his go&s;pel. You, moreover, &s;trengthen by your conduct the arguments of the Dei&s;ts again&s;t the particular doctrines of the Chri&s;ti|an revelation. You do more, you pre&s;erve a bloody fragment of the Jewi&s;n in&s;titutions.&mdash;
<Q>The Son of Man came not to <HI>de&s;troy</HI> men's lives, but to <HI>&s;ave</HI> them</Q>
Excellent words! I require no others to &s;atisfy me of the truth and divine original of the Chri&s;|tian religion; and while I am able to place a finger, upon this text of &s;cripture, I will not believe an angel

from heaven, &s;hould he declare that the puni&s;hment of death, for <HI>any</HI> crime, was inculcated, or permitted by the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The precious nature of human life in the eyes of the Saviour of mankind, appears further in the compa|rative value which he has placed upon it in the fol|lowing words.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matthew, x. v. 26.</NOTE> "For what is a man profited, if he &s;hall gain the whole world, &amp; lo&s;e his life, or what &s;hall a man give in exchange for his <HI>life.</HI>" I have re|jected the word <HI>&s;oul</HI> which is u&s;ed in the common tran&s;lation of this ver&s;e.

<P N="4">4. It has been &s;aid, that a man who has committed a murder, has di&s;covered a malignity of heart, that renders him ever afterwards unfit to live in human &s;ociety. This is by no means true in many, and perhaps in mo&s;t of the ca&s;es of murder. It is mo&s;t frequently the effect of a &s;udden gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, and has &s;ometimes been the only &s;tain of a well-&s;pent, or inoffen&s;ive life. There are many crimes which unfit a man much more for human &s;ociety, than a &s;ingle murder; and there have been in&s;tances of murderers, who have e&s;caped, or bribed the laws of their coun|try, who have afterwards become peaceable and u&s;eful members of &s;ociety. Let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed that I
<PB N="178" REF="034495_0184_0FFE027AF56AC248">
wi&s;h to palliate, by this remark, the enormity of murder. Far from it. It is only becau&s;e I view murder with &s;uch &s;uperlative horror, that I wi&s;h to deprive our laws of the power of perpetuating and encouraging it.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the confe&s;&s;ions of murderers have, in many in&s;tances, &s;anctioned the ju&s;tice of their puni&s;hment. I do not wi&s;h to le&s;&s;en the influence of &s;uch vulgar errors as tend to prevent crimes, but I will venture to declare, that many more murderers e&s;cape di&s;covery, than are detected, or puni&s;hed.&mdash; Were I not afraid of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon the patience of my readers, I might mention a number of facts, in which circum&s;tances of the mo&s;t trifling nature have become the means of detecting theft and forgery; from which I could draw as &s;trong proofs of the watchfulne&s;s of Providence over the property of individuals, and the order of &s;ociety, as have been drawn from the detection of murder. I might mention in&s;tances, likewi&s;e, of per&s;ons in whom con&s;cience has produced re&s;titution for &s;tolen goods, or confe&s;&s;ion of the ju&s;tice of the puni&s;hment which was inflicted for theft. Con&s;cience and knowledge always keep pace with each other, both with re&s;pect to divine and human laws.</P>
<P>The acquie&s;cence of murderers in the ju&s;tice of their execution, is the effect of prejudice and educa|tion. It cannot flow from a con&s;cience acting in
<PB N="179" REF="034495_0185_0FFE027C8C6CE498">
concert with rea&s;on or religion&mdash;for they both &s;peak a very different language.</P>
<P>The world has certainly undergone a material change for the better within the la&s;t two hundred years. This change has been produced chiefly, by the &s;ecret and unacknowledged influence of Chri&s;tianity upon the hearts of men. It is agreeable to trace the effects of the Chri&s;tian religion in the extirpation of &s;lavery&mdash;in the diminution of the number of capital puni&s;hments, and in the mitigation of the horrors of war. There was a time when ma&s;ters po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a power over the lives of their &s;laves. But Chri&s;tianity has depo&s;ed this power, and mankind begin to &s;ee every where that &s;lavery is alike contrary to the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, and the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel. There was a time when torture was part of the puni&s;hment of death, and when the number of capital crimes in Great Britain, amounted to one hundred and &s;ixty-one.&mdash; Chri&s;tianity has aboli&s;hed the former, and reduced the latter to not more than &s;ix or &s;even. It has done more. It has confined, in &s;ome in&s;tances, capital puni&s;hments to the crime of murder&mdash;and in &s;ome countries it has aboli&s;hed it altogether. The influence of Chri&s;tianity upon the modes of war, has &s;till been more remarkable. It is agreeable to trace its progre&s;s.</P>

<P>This is the only tenure by which war now holds its place among Chri&s;tians.

Already the princes and nations of the world di&s;cover the &s;truggles of opinion or con&s;cience in their pre|parations for war. Witne&s;s the many national di&s;|putes which have been lately terminated in Europe by negotiation, or mediation. Witne&s;s too, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the con&s;titution of the United States without force or blood&s;hed. The&s;e events indicate an improving &s;tate of human affairs. They lead us to look forward with expectation to the time, when the weapons of war &s;hall be changed into implements of hu&s;bandry, and when rapine and violence &s;hall be no more. The&s;e events are the promi&s;ed fruits of the go&s;pel. If they do not come to pa&s;s, the prophets

<P>P. S. Since the publication of this e&s;&s;ay and the proceeding one, the Author has had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his principles reduced to practice in the State of Penn&s;ylvania, in the abolition of the puni&s;h|ment of death for all crimes, (the highe&s;t degree of murder excepted) and in private puni&s;hments being &s;ub&s;tituted to tho&s;e which were public. The effects of this reformation in the penal laws of our &s;tate have been, a remarkable diminution of crimes of all kinds, and a great encrea&s;e of convictions in a given num|ber of offenders. The expen&s;es of the hou&s;e appro|priated to the puni&s;hment of criminals have been more than defrayed by the profits of their labor. Many of them have been reformed, and become u&s;eful members of &s;ociety, and very few have relap&s;ed into former habits of vice.</P>
<P>The Author is happy in adding, that a reformation in the penal laws of the &s;tates of New York and New Jer&s;ey has taken place, nearly &s;imilar to that which has been mentioned, in Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>It would be an act of inju&s;tice in this place not to acknowledge that the principles contained in the foregoing e&s;&s;ays, would probably have never been realiz|ed, had they not been &s;upported and enforced by the elo|quence

<HEAD>A PLAN OF A PEACE-OFFICE FOR THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the defects which have been point|ed out in the federal con&s;titution by its antifederal enemies, it is much to be lamented that no per&s;on has taken notice of its total &s;ilence upon the &s;ubject of an office of the utmo&s;t importance to the welfare of the United States, that is, an <HI>office</HI> for pro|moting and pre&s;erving perpetual <HI>peace</HI> in our country.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped that no objection will be made to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch an office, while we are engaged in a war with the Indians, for as the <HI>War-Office</HI> of the United States was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the <HI>time of peace,</HI> it is equally rea&s;onable that a <HI>Peace-Office</HI> &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the <HI>time of war.</HI></P>
<P>The plan of this office is as follows:</P>
<P N="1">I. Let a Secretary of the Peace be appointed to pre&s;ide in this office, who &s;hall be perfectly free from all the pre&s;ent ab&s;urd and vulgar European preju|dices upon the &s;ubject of government; let him be a genuine republican and a &s;incere Chri&s;tian, for the prin|ciples of republicani&s;m and Chri&s;tianity are no le&s;s friendly to univer&s;al and perpetual peace, than they are to univer&s;al and equal liberty.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="184" REF="034495_0190_0FFDC65F55BFB7F0">II. Let a power be given to this Secretary to e&s;ta|bli&s;h and maintain free-&s;chools in every city, village and town&s;hip of the United States; and let him be made re&s;pon&s;ible for the talents, principles, and morals, of all his &s;choolma&s;ters. Let the youth of our country be carefully in&s;tructed in reading, writing, arithmetic, and in the doctrines of a religion of &s;ome kind: the Chri&s;tian religion &s;hould be preferred to all others; for it belongs to this religion exclu&s;ively to teach us not only to cultivate peace with men, but to forgive, nay more&mdash;to love our very enemies. It belongs to it further to teach us that the Supreme Being alone po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a power to take away human life, and that we rebel again&s;t his laws, whenever we undertake to execute death in any way whatever upon any of his creatures.</P>
<P N="3">III. Let every family in the United States be fur|ni&s;hed at the public expen&s;e, by the Secretary of this office, with a copy of an American edition of the BIBLE. This mea&s;ure has become the more nece&s;&s;ary in our country, &s;ince the bani&s;hment of the bible, as a &s;chool-book, from mo&s;t of the &s;chools in the United States. Unle&s;s the price of this book be paid for by the public, there is rea&s;on to fear that in a few years it will be met with only in courts of ju&s;tice or in magi&s;trates' offices; and &s;hould the ab&s;urd mode of e&s;tabli&s;hing truth by ki&s;&s;ing this &s;acred book fall into di&s;u&s;e, it may probably, in the cour&s;e of the next

generation, be &s;een only as a curio&s;ity on a &s;helf in a public mu&s;eum.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Let the following &s;entence be in&s;cribed in letters of gold over the doors of every State and Court hou&s;e in the United States.</P>
<Q>THE SON OF MAN CAME INTO THE WORLD, NOT TO DESTROY MEN'S LIVES, BUT TO SAVE THEM.</Q>
<P N="5">V. To in&s;pire a veneration for human life, and an horror at the &s;hedding of human blood, let all tho&s;e laws be repealed which authori&s;e juries, judges, &s;heriffs, or hangmen to a&s;&s;ume the re&s;entments of individuals and to commit murder in cold blood in any ca&s;e whatever. Until this reformation in our code of penal juri&s;prudence takes place, it will be in vain to attempt to introduce univer&s;al and perpetual peace in our country.</P>
<P N="6">VI. To &s;ubdue that pa&s;&s;ion for war, which educa|tion, added to human depravity, have made univer&s;al, a familiarity with the in&s;truments of death, as well as all military &s;hows, &s;hould be carefully avoided.

<HEAD>INFORMATION TO EUROPEANS WHO ARE DISPOSED TO MIGRATE TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN A LETTER TO A FRIEND IN GREAT BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<P>AGREEABLY to your reque&s;t contained in your letter of the 29th of Augu&s;t, 1789, I have at la&s;t &s;at down to communicate &s;uch facts to you, upon the &s;ubject of migration to this country, as have been the re&s;ult of numerous enquiries and ob&s;ervation. I am aware that this &s;ubject has been handled in a ma&s;|terly manner by Doctor Franklin, in his excellent little pamplet, entitled
<Q>Advice to tho&s;e who would wi&s;h to remove to America,</Q>
but as that valuable little work is very general, and as many important changes have occurred in the affairs of the United States &s;ince its publication, I &s;hall endeavour to comply with your wi&s;hes, by adding &s;uch things as have been omitted by the Doctor, and &s;hall accommodate them to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our country.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin this letter by mentioning the de&s;crip|tions of people, who ought not to come to America.</P>
<P N="1">I. Men of independent fortunes who can exi&s;t only in company, and who can conver&s;e only upon public amu&s;ements, &s;hould not think of &s;ettling in the United States. I have known &s;everal men of that character in this country, who have rambled from State
<PB N="190" REF="034495_0196_0FFE0292A009E780">
to State, complaining of the dulne&s;s of each of them, and who have finally returned and renewed their for|mer connexions and plea&s;ures in Europe.</P>
<P N="2">II. Literary men, who have no profe&s;&s;ional pur&s;uits, will often langui&s;h in America, from the want of &s;ociety. Our authors and &s;cholars are generally men of bu&s;ine&s;s, and make their literary pur&s;uits &s;ub&s;ervient to their intere&s;ts. A lounger in book &s;tores, breakfa&s;ting parties for the purpo&s;e of literary conver&s;ation, and long attic evenings, are as yet but little known in this country. Our companies are generally mixed, and conver&s;ation in them is a medley of ideas upon all &s;ubjects. They begin as in England with the weather &mdash;&s;oon run into politics &mdash;now and then diverge into li|terature&mdash;and commonly conclude with facts relative to commerce, manufactures and agriculture, and the be&s;t means of acquiring and improving an e&s;tate. Men, who are philo&s;ophers or poets, without other pur&s;uits, had better end their days in an old country.</P>
<P N="3">III. The United States as yet afford but little en|couragement to the profe&s;&s;ers of mo&s;t of the fine arts. Painting and &s;culpture flouri&s;h chiefly in wealthy and luxurious countries. Our native American portrait painters who have not &s;ought protection and encou|ragement in Great Britain, have been obliged to travel occa&s;ionally from one State to another in order to &s;upport them&s;elves. The teachers of mu&s;ic have been more fortunate in America. A ta&s;te for this accom|pli&s;hment
<PB N="191" REF="034495_0197_0FFE0297D5FA28E0">
prevails very generally in our large cities: and eminent ma&s;ters in that art, who have arrived here &s;ince the peace, have received con&s;iderable &s;ums of money by exerci&s;ing their profe&s;&s;ion among us.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now mention tho&s;e de&s;criptions of people, who may better their condition by coming to America.</P>
<P N="1">I. To the cultivators of the earth the United States open the fir&s;t a&s;ylum in the world. To in&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;s and happine&s;s of an European Farmer in our country, it is nece&s;&s;ary to advi&s;e him either to purcha&s;e or to rent a farm which has undergone &s;ome improve|ment.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ettling a new tract of land, and that of improving a farm, are of a very different nature. The former mu&s;t be effected by the native American, who is accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of the axe and the grub|bing hoe, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es almo&s;t exclu&s;ively a know|ledge of all the peculiar and namele&s;s arts of &s;elf-pre&s;er|vation in the woods. I have known many in&s;tances of Europeans who have &s;pent all their ca&s;h in un&s;ucce&s;s|ful attempts to force a &s;ettlement in the wilderne&s;s, and who have afterwards been expo&s;ed to poverty and di&s;tre&s;s at a great di&s;tance from friends and even neighbours. I would therefore advi&s;e all farmers with moderate capitals, to purcha&s;e or rent improved farms in the old &s;ettlements of our States. The price and rent of the&s;e farms are different in the different parts of the union. In Penn&s;ylvania, the price of farms
<PB N="192" REF="034495_0198_0FFE02995E378110">
is regulated by the quality of the land&mdash;by the value or the improvements which are erected upon it&mdash;by their vicinity to &s;ea ports and navigable water&mdash;and by the good or bad &s;tate of the roads which lead to them. There is a great variety, of cour&s;e, in the price of farms: while &s;ome of them have been &s;old for five guineas&mdash; others have been &s;old at lower prices, down to one gui|nea, and even half a guinea per acre, according as they were varied by the above circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>It is not expected that the whole price of a farm &s;hould be paid at the time of purcha&s;ing it. An half, a third, or a fourth, is all that is generally re|quired. Bonds and mortgages are given for the re|mainder, (and &s;ometimes without intere&s;t) payable in two, three, five, or even ten years.</P>
<P>The value of the&s;e farms has often been doubled and even trebled, in a few years, where the new mode of agriculture has been employed in cultivating them: &s;o that a man with a moderate capital, may, in the cour&s;e of fifteen years, become an opulent and independent freeholder.</P>
<P>If, notwith&s;tanding what has been &s;aid of the difficulties of effecting an e&s;tabli&s;hment in the woods, the low price of the new lands &s;hould tempt the European Farmer to &s;ettle in them, then let me add, that it can only be done by a&s;&s;ociating him&s;elf in a large company, under the direction of an active and intelligent American farmer. To &s;ecure even a
<PB N="193" REF="034495_0199_0FFE029AE7BC2650">
company of European &s;ettlers from di&s;appointment and want in the woods, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to clear a few acres of land the year before, and to &s;ow them with grain, in order to provide &s;ub&s;i&s;tance for the company, till they can provide for them&s;elves, by clearing their own farms. The difficulties of e&s;tabli&s;h|ing this new &s;ettlement, will be further le&s;&s;ened, if a few cabins, a gri&s;t and a &s;aw mill be erected, at the &s;ame time the preparations are made for the temporary &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of the company. In this manner, mo&s;t of the fir&s;t &s;ettlements of the New England men have been made in this country. One great advantage, attend|ing this mode of &s;ettling, is, a company may always carry with them a clergyman and a &s;choolma&s;ter, of the &s;ame religion and language with them&s;elves. If a &s;ettler in the woods &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s a ta&s;te for rural elegance, he may gratify it without any expen&s;e, by the manner of laying out his farm. He may &s;hade his hou&s;e by means of ancient and venerable forre&s;t-trees. He may leave rows of them &s;tanding, to adorn his lanes and walks&mdash;or clu&s;ters of them on the high grounds of his fields, to &s;hade his cattle. If he &s;hould fix upon any of tho&s;e parts of our we&s;t|ern country, which are covered with the &s;ugar-trees, he may inclo&s;e a &s;ufficient number of them to &s;upply his family with &s;ugar; and may confer upon them at the &s;ame time the order and beauty of a fine or|chard. In this manner, a highly improved &s;eat may
<PB N="194" REF="034495_0200_0FFE029DAAF20C90">
be cut out of the woods in a few years, which will &s;ur|pa&s;s both in elegance and value a farm in an old &s;ettlement, which has been for twenty years the &s;ub|ject of improvements in ta&s;te and agriculture. To contemplate a dwelling-hou&s;e&mdash;a barn&mdash;&s;tables&mdash;fields &mdash;meadows&mdash;an orchard&mdash;a garden, &amp;c. which have been produced from original creation by the labour of a &s;ingle life, is, I am told, to the proprietor of them, one of the highe&s;t plea&s;ures the mind of man is capa|ble of enjoying. But how much mu&s;t this plea&s;ure be increa&s;ed, when the regularity of art is blended in the pro&s;pect, with the wildne&s;s and antiquity of nature?</P>
<P>It has been remarked in this country, that clearing the land of its woods, &s;ometimes makes a new &s;ettle|ment unhealthy, by expo&s;ing its damp grounds to the action of the &s;un. To obviate this evil, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ettler either to drain and cultivate his low grounds, as &s;oon as they are cleared, or to leave a body of trees between his dwelling hou&s;e, and the &s;pots from whence the morbid effluvia are derived. The la&s;t of the&s;e methods has, in no in&s;tance that I have heard of, failed of pre&s;erving whole families from &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es as ari&s;e from damp or putrid exha|lations.</P>
<P>To country gentlemen, who have been accu&s;tom|ed to live upon the income of a landed e&s;tate in Europe, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to communicate the following in|formation, viz. that farms, in con&s;equence of the
<PB N="195" REF="034495_0201_0FFE02A1A96E3F38">
unproductive woodland, which is generally connected with them, &s;eldom yield more than three or four per cent. a year in ca&s;h, except in the neighbour|hood of large cities. Be&s;ides, from the facility with which money enough may be &s;aved in a few years, to purcha&s;e land in this country, tenants will not accept of long lea&s;es: and hence they are not &s;ufficiently intere&s;ted in the farms they rent, to keep them in repair. If country gentlemen wi&s;h to derive the greate&s;t advantage from laying out their money in lands, they mu&s;t re&s;ide in their vicinity. A capital of five thou&s;and guineas, inve&s;ted in a number of contiguous farms, in an improved part of our country, and cultivated by tenants under the eye and direction of a landlord, would &s;oon yield a greater income than double that &s;um would in mo&s;t parts of Europe. The landlord in this ca&s;e mu&s;t frequently vi&s;it and in&s;pect the &s;tate of each of his farms: and now and then he mu&s;t &s;top to repair a bridge or a fence in his excur&s;ions through them. He mu&s;t receive all his rents in the produce of the farms. If the tenant find his own &s;tock, he will pay half of all the grain he rai&s;es, and &s;ometimes a certain proportion of ve|getables and live &s;tock, to his landlord. The divi&s;ion of the grain is generally made in the field, in &s;heaves or &s;tacks, which are carried home to be thra&s;hed in the barn of the landlord. An e&s;tated gentleman, who can reconcile him&s;elf to this kind of life, may be both happy and u&s;eful. He may in&s;truct his
<PB N="196" REF="034495_0202_0FFE02A46A67E178">
tenants by his example, as well as precepts in the new modes of hu&s;bandry: he may teach them the art and advantages of gardening: he may in&s;pire them with habits of &s;obriety, indu&s;try, and oeconomy; and thereby become the father and protector of a depen|dant and affectionate neighbourhood. After a bu&s;y &s;ummer and autumn, he may pa&s;s his winters in poli&s;h|ed &s;ociety in any of our cities, and in many of our country villages.</P>
<P>But &s;hould he be di&s;inclined to &s;uch exten&s;ive &s;cenes of bu&s;ine&s;s, he may confine his purcha&s;es and labours to a &s;ingle farm, and &s;ecure his &s;uperfluous ca&s;h in bonds and mortgages, which will yield him &s;ix per cent.</P>
<P>Under this head, it is proper to mention, that the agricultural life begins to maintain in the United States, the &s;ame rank that it has long maintained in Great Britain. Many gentlemen of education among us have quitted liberal profe&s;&s;ions, and have proved, by their &s;ucce&s;s in farming, that philo&s;ophy is in no bu&s;ine&s;s more u&s;eful or profitable, than in agriculture.</P>
<P N="2">II. MECHANICS and MANUFACTURERS, of every de&s;|cription, will find certain encouragement in the Uni|ted States. During the connection of this country with Great Britain, we were taught to believe that agriculture and commerce &s;hould be the only pur&s;uits of the Americans: but experiments and reflexion have taught us, that our country abounds with re|&s;ources
<PB N="197" REF="034495_0203_0FFE02A72DCA9478">
for manufactures of all kinds: and that mo&s;t of them may be conducted with great advantage in all the &s;tates We are already nearly independent of the whole world for iron-work, paper, and malt liquors: and great progre&s;s has been made in the manufac|turies of gla&s;s, pot-a&s;h, and cloths of all kinds. The commercial habits of our citizens have as yet prevented their employing large capitals in tho&s;e manufacturies: but I am per&s;uaded that if a few Euro|pean adventurers would embark in them with capitals equal to the demand for tho&s;e manufactures, they would &s;oon find an immen&s;e profit in their &s;peculations. A &s;ingle farmer in the &s;tate of New York, with a capital of five thou&s;and pounds, has cleared one thou&s;and a year by the manufacture of pot-a&s;h alone.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e mechanical arts, which are accomodated to the infant and &s;imple &s;tate of a country, will bid faire&s;t to &s;ucceed among us. Every art, connected with cul|tivating the earth&mdash;building hou&s;es and &s;hips, and feed|ing and clothing the body, will meet with encourage|ment in this country. The prices of provi&s;ions are &s;o different in the different &s;tates, and even in the different parts of the &s;ame &s;tate, and vary &s;o much with the plenty and &s;carcity of money, that it would be difficult to give you &s;uch an account of them as would be u&s;eful. I need only remark, that the di&s;pro|portion between the price of labour and of provi&s;ions, is much greater in every part of the United States, than in any part of Europe: and hence our trade&s;men
<PB N="198" REF="034495_0204_0FFE02A8EA544208">
every where eat meat and butter every day: and mo&s;t of them realize the wi&s;h of Henry IV. of France, for the pea&s;ants of his kingdom, by dining not only once, but two or three times, upon poultry, in every week of the year.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ingular fact in the hi&s;tory of the mechanical arts in this country, that the &s;ame arts &s;eldom de&s;cend from father to &s;on. Such are the profits of even the humble&s;t of them, that the &s;ons of mechanics generally ri&s;e from the lower to the more re&s;pectable occupa|tions: and thus their families gradually a&s;cend to the fir&s;t ranks in &s;ociety among us. The influence, which the pro&s;pects of wealth and con&s;equence have in invigo|rating indu&s;try in every line of mechanical bu&s;ine&s;s, is very great. Many of the fir&s;t men in America, are the &s;ons of reputable mechanics or farmers. But I may go farther, and add, that many men, who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves both in the cabinet and field, in the late war, had been mechanics. I know the Briti&s;h officers treated the American cau&s;e with contempt, from this circum&s;tance: but the event of the war &s;hewed, that the confidence of America was not mi&s;placed in that body of citizens.</P>
<P N="3">III. LABOURERS may depend upon con&s;tant em|ployment in the United States, both in our towns and in the country. When they work by the day, they receive high wages: but the&s;e are &s;eldom continued
<PB N="199" REF="034495_0205_0FFE02AE6A2F54E8">
through the whole year. A labourer receives annually, with his boarding, wa&s;hing, and lodging, from fif|teen to eighteen guineas, in the middle &s;tates. It is agreeable to ob&s;erve this cla&s;s of men frequently rai&s;ed by their indu&s;try from their humble &s;tations, into the upper ranks of life, in the cour&s;e of twenty or thirty years.</P>
<P N="4">IV. PERSONS who are willing to indent them&s;elves as &s;ervants for a few years, will find that humble &s;tation no ob&s;tacle to a future e&s;tabli&s;hment in our country. Many men, who came to America in that capacity, are now in affluent circum&s;tances. Their former &s;ituation, where they have behaved well, does not preclude them from forming re&s;pectable connec|tions in marriage, nor from &s;haring, if otherwi&s;e qualified, in the offices of our country.</P>
<P N="5">V. The United States continue to afford encourage|ment to gentlemen of the <HI>learned profe&s;&s;ions,</HI> provided they be prudent in their deportment, and of &s;ufficient knowledge: for &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of colleges and &s;chools of learning in all our &s;tates, the &s;ame degrees of learning will not &s;ucceed among us, which &s;ucceeded fifty years ago.</P>
<P>Several lawyers and phy&s;icians, who have arrived here &s;ince the peace, are now in good bu&s;ine&s;s: and many clergymen, natives of England, Scotland, and Ireland, are comfortably &s;ettled in good pari&s;hes. A
<PB N="200" REF="034495_0206_0FFE02AFF1DC30D0">
mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel in a country place mu&s;t not ex|pect to have all his &s;alary paid in ca&s;h: but he will notwith&s;tanding &s;eldom fail of obtaining a good &s;ub&s;i&s;|tance from his congregation. They will furni&s;h his table with a portion of all the live &s;tock they rai&s;e for their own u&s;e: they will &s;hoe his hor&s;es&mdash;repair his implements of hu&s;bandry, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in gathering in his harve&s;ts, and in many other parts of the bu&s;ine&s;s of his farm. From the&s;e aids, with now and then a little ca&s;h, a clergyman may not only live well, but, in the cour&s;e of his life, may accumulate an hand&s;ome e&s;tate for his children. This will more certainly happen, if he can redeem time enough from his paro|chial duties, and the care of his farm, to teach a &s;chool. The people of America are of all &s;ects: but the greate&s;t part of them are of the independent, pre&s;byterian, epi&s;|copal, bapti&s;t, and methodi&s;t denominations. The principles held by each of the&s;e &s;ocieties in America are the &s;ame as tho&s;e which are held by the prote&s;tant churches in Europe, from which they derive their origin.</P>
<P N="6">VI. SCHOOLMASTERS of good capacities and fair characters may exepct to meet with encouragement in the middle and &s;outhern &s;tates. They will &s;ucceed better, if they confine their in&s;tructions to reading, writing, Engli&s;h grammar, and the &s;ciences of number and quantity. The&s;e branches of literature are of general nece&s;&s;ity and utility: and of cour&s;e every
<PB N="201" REF="034495_0207_0FFE02B17988F930">
town&s;hip will furni&s;h &s;cholars enough for the main|tenance of a &s;choolma&s;ter. Many young men have ri&s;en by means of the connexions they have formed in this u&s;eful employment, to rank and con&s;equence in the learned profe&s;&s;ions in every part of this country.</P>
<P>From this account of the United States, you will ea&s;ily perceive, that they are a hot-bed for indu&s;try and genius in almo&s;t every human pur&s;uit. It is in|conceivable how many u&s;eful di&s;coveries nece&s;&s;ity has produced within the&s;e few years, in agriculture and manufactures, in our country. The &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity has produced a ver&s;atility of genius among our citizens: hence we frequently meet with men who have exerci&s;|ed two or three different occupations or profe&s;&s;ions in the cour&s;e of their lives, according to the influence which intere&s;t, accident, or local circum&s;tances have had upon them. I know that the peculiarities, which have been mentioned in the American character, &s;trike an European, who has been accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider man as a creature of habit, formed by long e&s;tabli&s;hed governments, and hereditary cu&s;toms, as &s;o many deviations from propriety and order. But a wi&s;e man, who knows that national characters ari&s;e from circum|&s;tances, will view the&s;e peculiarities without &s;urpri&s;e, and attribute them wholly to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of man|ners, &s;ociety, and government in America.</P>
<P>From the numerous competitions in every branch of bu&s;ine&s;s in Europe, &s;ucce&s;s in any pur&s;uit, may be
<PB N="202" REF="034495_0208_0FFE02B440234B28">
looked upon in the &s;ame light as a prize in a lottery. But the ca&s;e is widely different in America. Here there is room enough for every human talent and virtue to expand and flouri&s;h. This is &s;o invariably true, that I believe there is not an in&s;tance to be found, of an indu&s;trious, frugal prudent European, with &s;ober manners, who has not been &s;ucce&s;sful in bu&s;ine&s;s, in this country.</P>
<P>As a further inducement to Europeans to tran&s;port them&s;elves acro&s;s the Ocean, I am obliged to mention a fact that does little honour to the native American; and that is, in all competitions for bu&s;ine&s;s, where &s;uc|ce&s;s depends upon indu&s;try, the European is generally preferred. Indeed, &s;uch is the facility with which pro|perty is acquired, that where it does not operate as a &s;timulus to promote ambition, it is &s;ometimes accom|panied by a relaxation of indu&s;try in proportion to the number of years or generations which interpo&s;e be|tween the founder of an American family and his po&s;|terity. This preference of European mechanics ari&s;es, likewi&s;e, from the improvements in the different arts, which are from time to time imported by them into our country. To the&s;e facts I am happy in being able to add, that the years of anarchy, which proved &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting to the Europeans who arrived among us immediately after the peace, are now at an end, and that the United States have at la&s;t adopted a national government which unites with the vigour of monarchy and the &s;tability of ari&s;tocracy, all the freedom of
<PB N="203" REF="034495_0209_0FFE02B701FCD5B8">
a &s;imple republic. Its influence already in invigorat|ing indu&s;try, and reviving credit, is univer&s;al. There are &s;everal peculiarities in this government, which can|not fail of being agreeable to Europeans, who are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ettle in America.</P>
<P N="1">1. The equal &s;hare of power it holds forth to men of every religious &s;ect. As the fir&s;t fruits of this per|fection in our government, we already &s;ee three gen|tlemen of the Roman Catholic church, members of the legi&s;lature of the United States.</P>
<P N="2">2. Birth in America is not required for holding either power or office in the federal government, except that of Pre&s;ident of the United States. In con&s;equence of this principle of ju&s;tice, not only in the national government, but in all our &s;tate con&s;titutions, we dai|ly &s;ee the natives of Britain, Ireland, Germany, ad|vanced to the mo&s;t re&s;pectable employments in our country.</P>
<P N="3">3. By a late act of congre&s;s, only two years re&s;idence in the United States are nece&s;&s;ary to entitle foreign|ers of good character to all the priviliges of citizen|&s;hip. Even that &s;hort period of time has been found &s;ufficient to give &s;trangers a vi&s;ible intere&s;t in the &s;tability and freedom of our governments. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By a law pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the above, five years re&s;idence are nece&s;&s;ary to entitle a foreigner to citizen&s;hip.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is agreeable to ob&s;erve the influence which our republican governments have already had upon the
<PB N="204" REF="034495_0210_0FFE02BB4323F098">
tempers and manners of our citizens. Amu&s;ement is every where giving way to bu&s;ine&s;s: and local politene&s;s is yielding to univer&s;al civility. We differ about forms and modes in politics: but this difference begins to &s;ubmit to the re&s;traints of moral and &s;ocial obligation. Order and tranquility appear to be the natural con&s;equence of a well-balanced republic: for where men can remove the evils of their govern|ments by frequent elections, they will &s;eldom appeal to the le&s;s certain remedies of mobs or arms. It is with &s;ingular plea&s;ure that I can add further, that notwith&s;tanding the virulence of our di&s;&s;en&s;ions about independence and the federal government, there is now &s;carcely a citizen of the United States, who is not &s;atisfied with both, and who does not believe this country to be in a happier and &s;afer &s;ituation, than it was, in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing years of its dependence upon Great Britain.</P>
<P>The encouragement held out to European emigrants is not the &s;ame in all the &s;tates. New England, New York, and New Jer&s;ey, being nearly filled with culti|vators of the earth, afford encouragement chiefly to mechanicks and labourers. The inhabitants of New England have far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the inhabitants of the other &s;tates, in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of numerous and profitable manufactories. The&s;e wonderful people di&s;cover the &s;ame degrees of indu&s;try in cultivating the arts of peace, that they did of enterprize and per&s;everance, in the late war. They already export large quantities
<PB N="205" REF="034495_0211_0FFE02BE04A63368">
of wrought iron, hats, women's &s;hoes, chee&s;e, and linen and woolen cloth. The &s;tate of New-York has likewi&s;e di&s;covered a laudable &s;pirit for manu|facturers and dome&s;tic improvements. European arti&s;ts, therefore, cannot fail of meeting with encou|ragement in each of the above &s;tates.</P>
<P>Penn&s;ylvania affords an equal a&s;ylum to all the de|&s;criptions of people that have been mentioned, under the &s;econd head of this letter. Agriculture, manufac|tures, and many of the liberal arts &s;eem to vie with each other for pre-eminence in this &s;tate. Each of them is under the patronage of numerous and re&s;pectable &s;ocieties. No &s;tate in the union affords greater re|&s;ources for &s;hip building, malt liquors, maple &s;ugar, &s;ail cloth, iron work, woolen and linen cloths, pot-a&s;h, and gla&s;s. Coal, likewi&s;e, abounds on the &s;hores of the Su&s;quehanna, a large river which runs through half the &s;tate. The variety of &s;ects and nations, which com|po&s;e the inhabitants of this &s;tate, has hitherto prevented our having any &s;teady traits in our character. We po&s;&s;e&s;s the virtues and weakne&s;&s;es of mo&s;t of the &s;ects and nations of Europe. But this variety has produced &s;uch a colli&s;ion in opinions and intere&s;ts, as has greatly favoured the progre&s;s of genius in every art and &s;cience. We have been accu&s;ed of being factious by our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates. This mu&s;t be a&s;cribed chief|ly to our late &s;tate con&s;titution, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed by violence in the beginning of the late war, and which was never a&s;&s;ented to by a majority of the people.
<PB N="206" REF="034495_0212_0FFE02BF8D7079B8">
But that majority have at length a&s;&s;erted their power. A convention, compo&s;ed of an equal repre&s;entation of the people, has met and formed a new con&s;titution, which comprehends in it every principle of liberty and ju&s;t government. From the excellency of this con&s;titu|tion&mdash;from the harmony it has re&s;tored to our citizens &mdash;from the central &s;ituation of our &s;tate&mdash;from the number and cour&s;es of our rivers&mdash;from the facility with which we are able to draw the re&s;ources of the lakes to the Delaware&mdash;from the wealth of our capital&mdash;and above all, from the indu&s;try and &s;ober habits of our citizens&mdash;there can be no doubt that Penn&s;ylvania will always maintain the fir&s;t rank, for national pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, in the United States.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance, peculiar in a great de|gree to Pen&s;ylvania, which cannot fail of directing the eyes of the inhabitants of &s;everal of the European nations to this &s;tate&mdash;and that is, the natives of Britain, Ireland, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Holland, may here meet with their former fellow &s;ubjects, and receive from them that welcome and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which are the natural con&s;equences of the tie of country. So &s;trongly does this principle operate in America, that the natives of Germany and Ireland have formed them&s;elves into &s;ocieties in the city of Philadelphia, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of protecting, advi&s;ing, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting their country|men,
<PB N="207" REF="034495_0213_0FFE02C14F0BA770">
as &s;oon as they &s;et their feet upon the &s;hores of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the lands in Penn&s;ylvania are dearer than in &s;ome of our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates. They fell, it is true, for a greater nominal &s;um, than the lands of the neighbouring &s;tates: but in the end, they are much cheaper. The &s;oil is deep, rich, and durable, and from the &s;uperior indu&s;try and &s;kill of our farmers, our lands are more productive than tho&s;e of our neighbours; hence their higher price; for the price of lands is always in a ratio to their quality, produce and &s;ituation: hence likewi&s;e, we are able to tell the value of a farm in any part of the &s;tate, by fir&s;t finding out the quantity of grain an acre will produce, and the price of this grain at the neare&s;t mill or &s;tore, making &s;ome little allowance for the improvements which are connected with the farm. This remark is &s;o univer&s;ally true, that a farmer never mi&s;takes the application of it in pur|cha&s;ing land. There is a certain in&s;tinct, which governs in all purcha&s;es and &s;ales of farms, and which ari&s;es out of the principle I have mentioned: it is in general as accurate, as if it aro&s;e out of the nice&s;t calculation. It is from an ignorance or neglect of this principle, that &s;o many of our citizens have migrated to Kentucky, under a delu&s;ive expectation of purcha&s;ing lands cheaper than in the old &s;tates. They are in fact often much dearer when you e&s;timate their price by the profit of the grain which is cultivated upon them. For in&s;tance, an acre
<PB N="208" REF="034495_0214_0FFE02C54AF603D8">
of land in Kentucky, which &s;ells for a quarter of a guinea, and yields 30 bu&s;hels of corn, at four pence &s;terling per bu&s;hel, is dearer than land of the &s;ame quality in Penn&s;ylvania, at a guinea per acre, that yields the &s;ame quantity of corn, which can be &s;old at the neare&s;t mill or &s;tore for two &s;hillings &s;terl. per bu&s;hel. To cure this pa&s;&s;ion for migrating to the waters of the Ohio, there is but one remedy, and that is, to open the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. This, by rai&s;ing the price of produce, will rai&s;e the value of land &s;o high, as to de&s;troy the balance of attraction to that country. This truth is at pre&s;ent a &s;pecula|lative one, but I hope it will be reduced to practice before the waters of the Ohio and Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi have been dyed with the blood of two or three hundred thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The &s;tates to the &s;outhward of Penn&s;ylvania po&s;&s;e&s;s immen&s;e re&s;ources for political happine&s;s: but while they tolerate negro &s;lavery, they can never be an agreeable retreat for an European. This objection applies chiefly to the &s;ea coa&s;ts of tho&s;e &s;tates; for in the we&s;tern parts of them, the land is cultivated chiefly by freemen. The &s;oil and climate of the exten&s;ive we&s;tern country of tho&s;e &s;tates is kind and mild to a very great degree. There Europeans may pro&s;per and be happy.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I complied in a few words with your reque&s;t. In communicating many of the facts contained in this letter, I have not con&s;idered you
<PB N="209" REF="034495_0215_0FFE02C9457C6B40">
&s;imply as a citizen of London, or a &s;ubject of the crown of Britain. The whole family of mankind, I know are your brethren; and if men be happy I am &s;ure it is a matter of indifference to you, whether they enjoy their happine&s;s on this &s;ide, or on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic ocean.</P>
<P>From a review of the facts that have been men|tioned, you will perceive that the pre&s;ent is the age of rea&s;on and action in America. To our po&s;terity we mu&s;t bequeath the cultivation of the fine arts and the plea&s;ures of ta&s;te and &s;entiment. The foreigners who have vi&s;ited and de&s;cribed our country without making allowances for tho&s;e peculiarities which ari&s;e from our pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, have done as little honour to their under&s;tandings, as they have done to human nature. Nor have tho&s;e Europeans di&s;covered more wi&s;dom, who have blended with the American character, the accidental di&s;orders, which were the offspring of our late public commo|tions. They re&s;embled the &s;welling of the &s;ea, which &s;ucceeds a &s;torm. At pre&s;ent, they have as perfectly &s;ub&s;ided as the di&s;orders produced by the civil wars in England, in the la&s;t century.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat remarkable that in every age, great inventions and great revolutions in human affairs have taken place in a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to each other. The many curious machines for le&s;&s;ening labour, which
<PB N="210" REF="034495_0216_0FFE02CB17B6E470">
have lately been di&s;covered in Europe, will nece&s;&s;arily throw many thou&s;and artificers out of employment. Perhaps the late &s;ucce&s;sful application of the powers of fire and water to mechanical purpo&s;es in your country, was delayed until the pre&s;ent time, only that the &s;anctuary of our national government might be perfectly prepared to receive and protect tho&s;e indu&s;trious bodies of people, who formerly lived by the labour of their hands, and who might otherwi&s;e become a burden to the countries in which they had been deprived of the means of &s;upporting them&s;elves. Perhaps, too, the revolutions, which are now going forward in &s;everal of the governments on the conti|nent of Europe, have occurred at the pre&s;ent juncture for a purpo&s;e equally wi&s;e and benevolent. The fir&s;t effect of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of freedom in tho&s;e countries, will be to promote population, by reducing taxes, di&s;banding &s;tanding armies, and aboli&s;hing the vows and practices of celibacy: for I take it for granted that military in&s;titutions in the time of peace, and mona&s;teries of all kinds, mu&s;t yield to the pre|&s;ent force and cultivated &s;tate of human rea&s;on, in tho&s;e countries, which are now the theatres of revolu|tions in favour of liberty. This increa&s;e of population will require an increa&s;e of territory, which mu&s;t be &s;ought for in the United States: for it is not probable that men who have once ta&s;ted of the &s;weets of liberty, will ever think of tran&s;porting them&s;elves to any other country. This outlet for &s;upernumerary inhabitants
<PB N="211" REF="034495_0217_0FFE02CDE38794C0">
from the nations of Europe, will eventually promote their intere&s;ts and pro&s;perity: for when a country is &s;o much crouded with people, that the price of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is beyond the ratio of their indu&s;try, marriages are re&s;trained: but when emi|gration to a certain degree takes place, the balance between the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and indu&s;try is re&s;tored, and population thereby revived. Of the truth of this principle there are many proofs in the old counties of all the American &s;tates. Population has con&s;tantly been advanced in them by the migration of their inhabitants to new or di&s;tant &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all the little &s;y&s;tems of narrow politicians, it is an eternal truth, that univer&s;al happine&s;s is uni|ver&s;al intere&s;t. The divine government of our world would admit of a controver&s;y, if men, by acquiring moral or political happine&s;s, in one part, added to the mi&s;ery of the inhabitants of another part, of our globe.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this long letter by the two fol|lowing remarks:</P>
<P N="1">I. If freedom, joined with the facility of acquiring the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, have &s;uch an influence upon population&mdash;and if exi&s;tence be a title to happine&s;s&mdash; then think, &s;ir, what an ocean of additional happine&s;s will be created, by the influence which migration to the free and exten&s;ive territories of the United States will have, upon the numbers of mankind.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="212" REF="034495_0218_0FFE02D31824F820">II. If wars have been promoted in all ages and countries, by an over proportion of inhabitants to the means of ea&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, then think, &s;ir, what an influence upon the means of &s;upporting human life, migration to America, and the immen&s;e increa&s;e of the productions of the earth, by the late improve|ments in agriculture, will probably have, in le&s;&s;ening the temptations and re&s;ources of nations to carry on war. The promi&s;es of heaven are often accom|pli&s;hed by means in which there is no departure from the common operations of nature. If the events, which have been alluded to, &s;hould con|tribute in any degree to put an end to wars, it will furni&s;h a noble triumph to your &s;ociety <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The gentleman to whom this letter is addre&s;&s;ed, is of the &s;ociety of the people called quakers.</NOTE>, by &s;hewing how much enlightened policy, and national happine&s;s, are connected with the dictates of chri&s;|tianity.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE PROGRESS OF POPULATION, AGRICULTURE, MANNERS, AND GOVERNMENT IN PENNSYLVANIA, IN A LETTER TO A FRIEND IN ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHATEVER tends to unfold <HI>facts</HI> in the hi&s;tory of the human &s;pecies, mu&s;t be intere&s;ting to a curious enquirer.&mdash;The manner of &s;ettling a new country, exhibits a view of the human mind &s;o foreign to the views of it which have been taken for many centuries in Europe, that I flatter my&s;elf the following account of the progre&s;s of po|pulation, agriculture, manners, and government in Penn&s;ylvania will be acceptable to you. I have cho&s;en to confine my&s;elf in the pre&s;ent letter to Penn&s;ylvania only, that all the information I &s;hall give you may be derived from my own knowledge and ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;ettler in the woods is generally a man who has outlived his credit or fortune in the cultivated parts of the State. His time for migrating is in the month of April. His fir&s;t object is to build a &s;mall cabbin of rough logs for him&s;elf and family. The floor of this cabbin is of earth, the roof is of &s;plit logs&mdash;the light is received through the door, and, in
<PB N="214" REF="034495_0220_0FFE02D65443AEE0">
&s;ome in&s;tances, through a &s;mall window made of grea&s;ed paper. A coar&s;er building adjoining this cabbin affords a &s;helter to a cow and a pair of poor hor&s;es. The labor of erecting the&s;e buildings is &s;ucceeded by killing the trees on a few acres of ground near his cabbin; this is done by cutting a circle round the trees, two or three feet from the ground. The ground around the&s;e trees is then ploughed and Indian-corn planted in it. The &s;ea&s;on for planting this grain is about the 20th of May&mdash; It grows generally on new ground with but little cultivation, and yields in the month of October fol|lowing, from forty to fifty bu&s;hels by the acre. After the fir&s;t of September it affords a good deal of nou|ri&s;hment to his family, in its green or unripe &s;tate, in the form of what is called <HI>roa&s;ting ears.</HI> His family is fed during the &s;ummer by a &s;mall quantity of grain which he carries with him, and by fi&s;h and game. His cows and hor&s;es feed upon wild gra&s;s, or the &s;ucculent twigs of the woods. For the fir&s;t year he endures a great deal of di&s;tre&s;s from hunger&mdash;cold&mdash; and a variety of accidental cau&s;es, but he &s;eldom complains or &s;inks under them. As he lives in the neighbourhood of Indians, he &s;oon acquires a &s;trong tincture of their manners. His exertions, while they continue, are violent; but they are &s;ucceeded by long intervals of re&s;t. His plea&s;ures con&s;i&s;t chiefly in fi&s;hing and hunting. He loves &s;pirituous liquors, and he eats, drinks and &s;leeps in dirt and rags in his little cabbin. In his intercour&s;e with the world
<PB N="215" REF="034495_0221_0FFE02DB8F8367B0">
he manife&s;ts all the arts which characterize the Indians of our country. In this &s;ituation he pa&s;&s;es two or three years. In proportion as population increa&s;es around him, he becomes unea&s;y and di&s;&s;atisfi|ed. Formerly his cattle ranged at large, but now his neighbours call upon him to confine them with|in fences, to prevent their tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon their fields of grain. Formerly he fed his family with wild animals, but the&s;e, which fly from the face of man, now cea&s;e to afford him an ea&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and he is compelled to rai&s;e dome&s;tic animals for the &s;upport of his family. Above all, he revolts again&s;t the operation of laws. He cannot bear to &s;urrender up a &s;ingle natural right for all the benefits of go|vernment,&mdash;and therefore he abandons his little &s;ettlement, and &s;eeks a retreat in the woods, where he again &s;ubmits to all the toils which have been mentioned. There are in&s;tances of many men who have broken ground on bare creation, not le&s;s than four different times in this way, in different and more advanced parts of the State. It has been remarked, that the flight of this cla&s;s of people is always in|crea&s;ed by the preaching of the go&s;pel. This will not &s;urpri&s;e us when we con&s;ider how oppo&s;ite its precepts are to their licentious manner of living. If our fir&s;t &s;ettler was the owner of the &s;pot of land which he began to cultivate, he &s;ells it at a con&s;idera|ble profit to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; but if (as is oftner the ca&s;e) he was a tenant to &s;ome rich landholder,
<PB N="216" REF="034495_0222_0FFE02DD177A3D18">
he abandons it in debt; however, the &s;mall improve|ments he leaves behind him, generally make it an object of immediate demand to a <HI>&s;econd</HI> &s;pecies of &s;ettler.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies of &s;ettler is generally a man of &s;ome property,&mdash;he pays one third or one fourth part in ca&s;h for his plantation, which con&s;i&s;ts of three or four hundred acres, and the re&s;t in gales or in&s;tal|ments, as it is called here; that is, a certain &s;um yearly, without intere&s;t, 'till the whole is paid. The fir&s;t object of this &s;ettler is to build an addition to his cabbin; this is done with hewed logs: and as &s;aw-mills generally follow &s;ettlements, his floors are made of boards; his roof is made of what are call|ed clapboards, which are a kind of coar&s;e &s;hingles, &s;plit out of &s;hort oak logs. This hou&s;e is divided by two floors, on each of which are two rooms: under the whole is a cellar walled with &s;tone. The cabbin &s;erves as kitchen to this hou&s;e. His next object is to clear a little meadow ground, and plant an orchard of two or three hundred apple trees. His &s;table is likewi&s;e enlarged; and, in the cour&s;e of a year or two, he builds a large log barn, the roof of which is commonly thatched with rye &s;traw: he moreover encrea&s;es the quantity of his arable land; and, in&s;tead of cultivating Indian corn alone, he rai&s;es a quantity of wheat and rye: the latter is cultivated chiefly for the purpo&s;e of being di&s;tilled into whi&s;key. This &s;pe|cies
<PB N="217" REF="034495_0223_0FFE02DFD94BB158">
of &s;ettler by no means extracts all from the earth, which it is capable of giving. His fields yield but a &s;canty increa&s;e, owing to the ground not being &s;uffici|ently ploughed. The hopes of the year are often bla&s;ted by his cattle breaking through his half made fences, and de&s;troying his grain. His hor&s;es perform but half the labor that might be expected from them, if they were better fed; and his cattle often die in the &s;pring from the want of provi&s;ion, and the delay of gra&s;s. His hou&s;e, as well as his farm, bear many marks of a weak tone of mind. His windows are unglazed, or, if they have had gla&s;s in them, the ruins of it are &s;upplied with old hats or pillows. This &s;pecies of &s;ettler is &s;eldom a good mem|ber of civil or religious &s;ociety: with a large portion of a hereditary mechanical kind of religion, he neglects to contribute &s;ufficiently towards building a church, or maintaining a regular admini&s;tration of the ordinances of the go&s;pel: he is equally indi&s;po&s;ed to &s;upport civil government: with high ideas of liberty, he refu&s;es to bear his proportion of the debt contracted by its e&s;|tabli&s;hment in our country: he delights chiefly in com|pany&mdash;&s;ometimes drinks &s;pirituous liquors to exce&s;s&mdash; will &s;pend a day or two in every week, in attending political meetings; and, thus, he contracts debts which, (if he cannot di&s;charge in a depreciated paper curren|cy) compel him to &s;ell his plantation, generally in the cour&s;e of a few years, to the <HI>third</HI> and la&s;t &s;pecies of &s;ettler.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="034495_0224_0FFE02E1AA865A40">This &s;pecies of &s;ettler is commonly a man of proper|ty and good character&mdash;&s;ometimes he is the &s;on of a wealthy farmer in one of the interior and ancient counties of the &s;tate. His fir&s;t object is to convert every &s;pot of ground, over which he is able to draw water, into meadow: where this cannot be done, he &s;elects the mo&s;t fertile &s;pots on the farm, and devotes it by manure to that purpo&s;e. His next object is to build a barn, which he prefers of &s;tone. This build|ing is, in &s;ome in&s;tances, 100 feet in front, and 40 in depth: it is made very compact, &s;o as to &s;hut out the cold in winter; for our farmers find that their hor&s;es and cattle, when kept warm, do not require near as much food, as when they are expo&s;ed to the cold. He u&s;es oeconomy, likewi&s;e, in the con&s;ump|tion of his wood. Hence he keeps him&s;elf warm in winter, by means of &s;toves, which &s;ave an immen&s;e deal of labour to him&s;elf and his hor&s;es, in cutting and hawling wood in cold and wet weather. His fences are every where repaired, &s;o as to &s;ecure his grain from his own and his neighbour's cattle. But further, he increa&s;es the number of the articles of his cultivation, and, in&s;tead of rai&s;ing corn, wheat and rye alone, he rai&s;es oats, buckwheat, (the fagopyrum of Linnaeus) and &s;pelts. Near his hou&s;e, he allots an acre or two of ground for a garden, in which he rai&s;es a large quantity of cabbage and potatoes. His newly cleared fields, afford him every year a large increa&s;e of turnips. Over the &s;pring which &s;upplies

The la&s;t object of his indu&s;try is to build a dwelling hou&s;e. This bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;ometimes effected in the cour&s;e of his life, but is oftener bequeathed to his &s;on, or the inheritor of his plantation: and hence we have a common &s;aying among our be&s;t farmers,
<Q>that a &s;on &s;hould always begin where his father left off;</Q>
that is, he &s;hould begin his improvements, by building a commodious dwelling-hou&s;e, &s;uited to the improvements and value of the plantation. This dwelling-hou&s;e is generally built of &s;tone&mdash;it is large, convenient, and filled with u&s;eful and &s;ub&s;tantial furniture&mdash;It &s;ometimes adjoins the hou&s;e of the &s;econd &s;ettler, but is frequently placed at a little di&s;tance from it. The hor&s;es and cattle of this &s;pecies of &s;ettler, bear marks in their &s;trength, fat and fruitfulne&s;s&mdash;of their being plentifully fed and carefully kept. His table abounds with a variety of the be&s;t provi&s;ions&mdash;his very kitchen flows with milk and honey&mdash;beer, cyder, and home made wine are the u&s;ual drinks of his family: the greate&s;t part of the cloathing of his family is manufactured by his wife and daughters: in proportion as he encrea&s;es in wealth, he values the protection of laws: hence

he punctually pays his taxes towards the &s;upport of government. Schools and churches likewi&s;e, as the means of promoting order and happine&s;s in &s;ociety, derive a due &s;upport from him: for benevolence and public &s;pirit&punc; as to tae&s;e objects, are the natural off|&s;pring of affluence and independence. Of this cla&s;s of &s;ettlers are two-thirds of the farmers of Penn&s;ylvania. The&s;e are the men to whom Penn&s;ylvania owes her an|cient fame and con&s;equence. If they po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s re|finement than their &s;outhern neighbours, who cultivate their land with &s;laves, they po&s;&s;e&s;s more republican vir|tue. It was from the farms cultivated by the&s;e men, that the American and French armies were chiefly fed with bread during the late revolution; and it was from the produce of the&s;e farms, that tho&s;e millions of dollars were obtained from the Havanna after the year 1780, which laid the foundation of the bank of North Ame|rica, and which fed and cloathed the American army, till the peace of Paris.&mdash;This is a &s;hort account of the happine&s;s of a Penn&s;ylvania farmer&mdash;To this happi|ne&s;s our &s;tate invites men of every religion and country.</P>
<P>We do not pretend to offer emigrants the plea&s;ures of Arcadia&mdash;It is enough if affluence, independence, and happine&s;s are en&s;ured to patience, indu&s;try, and labour.

The quality of the &s;oil&mdash;its vicinity to mills, court-hou&s;es, places of wor&s;hip, and navigable water: the di&s;tance of land-carriage to the &s;ea-ports of Philadelphia or Baltimore, and the nature of the roads, all influence the price of land to the fir&s;t &s;ettler. The quantity of cleared land, and the nature of the improvements, added to all the above circum&s;tances, in|fluence the price of farms to the &s;econd and third &s;ettlers. Hence the price of land to the fir&s;t &s;ettlers is from a quarter of a guinea to two guineas per acre; and the price of farms is from one guinea to ten guineas per acre, to the &s;econd and third &s;ettlers, according as the land is varied by the before-mentioned circum&s;tances. When the fir&s;t &s;ettler is unable to purcha&s;e, he often takes a tract of land for &s;even years on a lea&s;e, and contracts in&s;tead of paying a rent in ca&s;h, to clear 50 acres of land, to build a log cabbin, and a barn, and to plant an orchard on it.

<P>From a review ef the three different &s;pecies of &s;et|tlers, it appears, that there are certain regular &s;tages which mark the progre&s;s from the &s;avage to civilized life.

<P>I do not pretend to &s;ay, that this mode of &s;ettling farms in Penn&s;ylvania is univer&s;al&mdash;I have known &s;ome in&s;tances where the fir&s;t &s;ettler has performed the improvements of the &s;econd, and yielded to the third. I have known a few in&s;tances likewi&s;e, of men of enterprizing &s;pirits, who have &s;ettled in the wil|derne&s;s, and who, in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle life, have advanced through all the intermediate &s;tages of im|provement that I have mentioned and produced all tho&s;e conveniences which have been a&s;cribed to the third &s;pecies of &s;ettlers; thereby re&s;embling, in their exploits, not only the pioneers and light-infantry, but the main body of an army. There are in&s;tances likewi&s;e, where the fir&s;t &s;ettlement has been improved by the &s;ame family, in hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, 'till it has reached the third &s;tage of cultivation.

farms in the neighbouring counties of the city of Philadelphia, which are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the grand&s;ons and great-grand&s;ons of men who accompanied William Penn acro&s;s the ocean, and who laid the foun|dation of the pre&s;ent improvements of their po&s;terity, in &s;uch cabbins as have been de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;ion for migration which I have de&s;cribed, will appear &s;trange to an European. To &s;ee men turn their backs upon the hou&s;es in which they drew their fir&s;t breath&mdash;upon the church in which they were dedicated to God&mdash;upon the graves of their ance&s;tors&mdash;upon the friends and companions of their youth&mdash;and upon all the plea&s;ures of cultivated &s;ociety, and expo&s;ing them&s;elves to all the hard|&s;hips and accidents of &s;ubduing the earth, and thereby e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ettlements in a wilderne&s;s, mu&s;t &s;trike a philo&s;opher on your &s;ide the water, as a picture of human nature that runs counter to the u&s;ual habits and principles of action in man. But this pa&s;&s;ion, &s;trange and new as it appears, is wi&s;ely calculated for the extention of population in America: and this it does, not only by promoting the increa&s;e of the human &s;pecies in new &s;ettlements, but in the old &s;ettlements likewi&s;e. While the degrees of in|du&s;try and knowledge in agriculture, in our country, are proportioned to farms of from 75 to 300 acres, there will be a languor in population, as &s;oon as farmers multiply beyond the number of farms of the
<PB N="224" REF="034495_0230_0FFE02F4D9316EB0">
above dimen&s;ions. To remove this languor, which is kept up alike by the increa&s;e of the price, and the divi&s;ion of farms, a migration of part of the com|munity becomes ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. And as this part of the community often con&s;i&s;ts of the idle and extravagant, who eat without working, their removal, by increa&s;ing the facility of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the frugal and indu&s;trious who remain behind, naturally increa&s;es the number of people, ju&s;t as the cutting off the &s;uckers of an apple-tree increa&s;es the &s;ize of the tree, and the quantity of fruit.</P>
<P>I have only to add upon this &s;ubject, that the migrants from Penn&s;ylvania always travel to the &s;outh|ward. The &s;oil and climate of the we&s;tern parts of Virginia, North and South-Carolina, and Georgia, afford a more ea&s;y &s;upport to lazy farmers, than the &s;tubborn but durable &s;oil of Penn&s;ylvania.&mdash;<HI>Here,</HI> our ground requires deep and repeated plowing to render it fruitful&mdash;<HI>there,</HI> &s;cratching the ground once or twice affords tolerable crops. In Penn&s;ylvania, the length and coldne&s;s of the winter make it nece&s;&s;ary for the farmers to be&s;tow a large &s;hare of their labour in pro|viding for and feeding their cattle; but in the &s;outhern &s;tates, cattle find pa&s;ture during the greate&s;t part of the winter, in the fields or woods. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, the greate&s;t part of the we&s;tern counties of the States, that have been mentioned, are &s;ettled by original in|habitants of Penn&s;ylvania. During the late war, the
<PB N="225" REF="034495_0231_0FFE02F664A91220">
militia of Orange county, in North Carolina, were enrolled, and their number amounted to 3,500, <HI>every</HI> man of whom had migrated from Penn&s;ylyania. From this you will &s;ee, that our State is the great outport of the United States for Europeans; and that, after performing the office of a &s;ieve by detaining all tho&s;e people who po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;tamina of indu&s;try and virtue, it allows a pa&s;&s;age to the re&s;t, to tho&s;e States which are accommodated to their habits of indolence.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this letter by remarking, that in the mode of extending population and agriculture, which I have de&s;cribed, we behold a new &s;pecies of war. The <HI>third</HI> &s;ettler may be viewed as a conqueror. The weapons with which he atchieves his conque&s;ts, are the implements of hu&s;bandry: and the virtues which direct them, are indu&s;try and oeconomy. Idlene&s;s&mdash; extravagance&mdash;and ignorance fly before him. Happy would it be for mankind, if the kings of Europe would adopt this mode of extending their territories: it would &s;oon put an end to the dreadful connection, which has exi&s;ted in every age, between war and poverty, and between conque&s;t and de&s;olation.</P>

<HEAD>[AN ACCOUNT OF THE MANNERS OF THE GERMAN INHABITANTS OF PENNSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania is &s;o much in|debted for her pro&s;perity and reputation, to the German part of her citizens, that a &s;hort account of their manners may, perhaps, be u&s;eful and agreeable to their fellow citizens in every part of the United States.</P>
<P>The aged Germans, and the ance&s;tors of tho&s;e who are young, migrated chiefly from the Palatinate; from Alcace, Swabis, Saxony, and Switzerland: but natives of every principality and dukedom, in Germany, are to be found in different parts of the &s;tate. They brought but little property with them. A few pieces of gold or &s;ilver coin, a che&s;t filled with clothes, a bible, and a prayer or an hymn book con&s;tituted the whole &s;tock of mo&s;t of them. Many of them bound them&s;elves, or one or more of their children, to ma&s;|ters after their arrival, for four, five, or &s;even years, in order to pay for their pa&s;&s;ages acro&s;s the ocean. A clergyman always accompanied them when they came in large bodies.</P>
<P>The principal part of them were farmers; but there were many mechanics, who brought with them a knowledge of tho&s;e arts which are nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="227" REF="034495_0233_0FFE02FA0AB86668">
and u&s;eful in all countries. The&s;e mechanics were chiefly weavers, taylors, tanners, &s;hoemakers, comb-makers, &s;miths of all kinds, butchers, paper-makers, watch makers, and &s;ugar bakers. I &s;hall begin this account of the German inhabitants of Penn&s;ylvania, by de&s;cribing the manners of the German farmers&punc;</P>
<P>This body of citizens are not only indu&s;trious and frugal, but &s;kilful cultivators of the earth. I &s;hall enumerate a few particulars, in which they differ from mo&s;t of the other farmers of Penn&s;yl|vania.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. In &s;ettling a tract of land, they always pro|vide large and &s;uitable accomodations for their hor&s;es and cattle, before they lay out much money in building a hou&s;e for them&s;elves. The barn and the &s;tables are generally under one roof, and contrived in &s;uch a manner as to enable them to feed their hor&s;es and cattle, and to remove their dung, with as little trouble as po&s;&s;ible. The fir&s;t dwelling hou&s;e upon this farm is &s;mall, and built of logs. It gen|erally la&s;ts the life time of the fir&s;t &s;ettler of a tract of land; and hence they have a &s;aying, that
<Q>a &s;on &s;hould always begin his improvements where his father left off,</Q>
&mdash;that is, by building a large and convenient &s;tone hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2d. They always prefer good land or that land on which there is a large quantity of meadow ground.
<PB N="228" REF="034495_0234_0FFE030078CE28F8">
From an attention to the cultivation of gra&s;s, they often double the value of an old farm in a few years, and grow rich on farms, on which their predece&s;&s;ors of whom they purcha&s;ed them, have nearly &s;tarved. They prefer purcha&s;ing farms with &s;ome improvements to &s;ettling on a new tract of land.</P>
<P N="3">3d. In clearing new land, they do not girdle the trees &s;imply, and leave them to peri&s;h in the ground, as is the cu&s;tom of their Engli&s;h or Iri&s;h neighbours; but they generally cut them down and burn them. In de&s;troying under-wood and bu&s;hes, they generally grub them out of the ground; by which means a field is as fit for cultivation the &s;econd year after it is cleared, as it is in twenty years afterwards. The advantages of this mode of clearing, con&s;i&s;t in the im|mediate product of the field, and in the greater faci|lity with which it is ploughed, harrowed and reaped. The expen&s;e of repairing a plough, which is often broken two or three times in a year by &s;mall &s;tumps concealed in the ground, is often greater than the ex|traordinary expen&s;e of grubbing the &s;ame field com|pletely, in clearing it.</P>
<P N="4">4th. They feed their hor&s;es and cows, of which they keep only a &s;mall number, in &s;uch a manner, that the former perform twice the labour of tho&s;e hor&s;es, and the latter yield twice the quantity of milk of tho&s;e cows, that are le&s;s plentifully fed. There is great oeconomy in this practice, e&s;pecially
<PB N="229" REF="034495_0235_0FFE030204ED69E0">
in a country where &s;o much of the labour of a farmer is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport his dome&s;tic ani|mals. A German hor&s;e is known in every part of the &s;tate: indeed he &s;eems to
<Q>feel with his lord, the plea&s;ure and the pride</Q>
of his ex|traordinary &s;ize or fat.</P>
<P N="5">5th. The fences of a German farm are generally high, and well built; &s;o that his fields &s;eldom &s;uf|fer from the inroads of his own or his neighbours, hor&s;es, cattle, hogs, or &s;heep.</P>
<P N="6">6th. The German farmers are great oeconomi&s;ts of their <HI>wood.</HI> Hence they burn it only in &s;toves, in which they con&s;ume but a 4th. or 5th. part of what is com|monly burnt in ordinary open fire places: be&s;ides, their hor&s;es are &s;aved by means of this oeconomy, from that immen&s;e labour, in hauling wood in the middle of winter, which frequently unfits the hor&s;es of their neighbours for the toils of the en&s;uing &s;pring. Their hou&s;es are, moreover, rendered &s;o comfortable, at all times, by large clo&s;e &s;toves, that twice the bu&s;ine&s;s is done by every branch of the family, in knit|ing, &s;pinning, and mending farming uten&s;ils, that is done in hou&s;es where every member of the family crouds near to a common fire-place, or &s;hivers at a di&s;tance from it,&mdash;with hands and fingers that move, by rea&s;on of the cold, with only half their u&s;ual quick|ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="034495_0236_0FFE03038CC76878">They di&s;cover oeconomy in the pre&s;ervation and in|crea&s;e of their wood in &s;everal other ways. They &s;ometimes defend it, by high fences, from their cattle; by which means the young fore&s;t trees are &s;uffered to grow, to replace tho&s;e that are cut down for the nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e of the farm. But where this cannot be conveniently done, they &s;urround the &s;tump of that tree which is mo&s;t u&s;eful for fences, viz. the che&s;nut, with a &s;mall triangular fence. From this &s;tump a number of &s;uckers &s;hoot out in a few years, two or three of which in the cour&s;e of five and twenty years, grow into trees of the &s;ame &s;ize as the tree from who&s;e roots they derived their origin.</P>
<P N="7">7th. They keep their hor&s;es and cattle as warm as po&s;&s;ible in winter, by which means they &s;ave a great deal of their hay and grain; for tho&s;e animals when cold, eat much more than when they are in a more comfortable &s;ituation.</P>
<P N="8">8th. The German farmers live frugally in their families, with re&s;pect to diet, furniture and apparel. They &s;ell their mo&s;t profitable grain, which is wheat; and eat that which is le&s;s profitable, but more nouri&s;h|ing, that is rye or Indian corn. The profit to a farmer, from this &s;ingle article of oeconomy, is equal, in the cour&s;e of a life time, to the price of a farm for one of his children. They eat &s;paringly of boiled animal food, with large quantities of vegetables, particularly &s;allad, turnips, onions, and cabbage,
<PB N="231" REF="034495_0237_0FFE0308C7CCA0B8">
the la&s;t of which they make into <HI>&s;our crout.</HI> They likewi&s;e u&s;e a large quantity of milk and chee&s;e in their diet. Perhaps the Germans do not propor|tion the quantity of their animal food, to the degrees of their labour; hence it has been thought, by &s;ome people, that they decline in &s;trength &s;ooner than their Engli&s;h or Iri&s;h neighbours. Very few of them ever u&s;e di&s;tilled &s;pirits in their families: their com|mon drinks are cyder, beer, wine, and &s;imple water. The furniture of their hou&s;e is plain and u&s;eful. They cover them&s;eves in winter with light feather beds in&s;tead of blankets: in this contrivance there is both convenience, and oeconomy, for the beds are warmer than blankets, and they are made by them|&s;elves. The apparel of the German farmers is u|&s;ually <HI>home &s;pun.</HI> When they u&s;e European articles of dre&s;s, they prefer tho&s;e which are of the be&s;t qua|lity, and of the highe&s;t price. They are afraid of debt, and &s;eldom purcha&s;e any thing without paying ca&s;h for it.</P>
<P N="9">9th. The German farmers have large or profitable gardens near their hou&s;es. The&s;e contain little el&s;e but u&s;eful vegetables. Penn&s;ylvania is indebted to the Ger|mans for the principal part of her knowledge in hor|ticulture. There was a time when turnips and cabbage were the principal vegetables that were u&s;ed in diet by the citizens of Philadelphia. This will not &s;urpri&s;e tho&s;e per&s;ons, who know that the fir&s;t Engli&s;h &s;ettlers in Penn&s;ylvania left England while horticulture was in
<PB N="232" REF="034495_0238_0FFE030A4EF80030">
its infancy in that country. It was not till the reign of William III. that this u&s;eful and agreeable art was cultivated by the Engli&s;h nation. Since the &s;ettlement of a number of German gardeners in the neighbour|hood of Philadelphia, the tables of all cla&s;&s;es of citizens have been covered with a variety of vegetables, in every &s;ea&s;on of the year; and to the u&s;e of the&s;e vegetables, in diet, may be a&s;cribed the general exemp|tion of the citizens of Philadelphia from di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;kin.</P>
<P N="10">10th. The Germans &s;eldom <HI>hire</HI> men to work upon their farms. The feeblene&s;s of that authority which ma&s;ters po&s;&s;e&s;ses over hired &s;ervants, is &s;uch that their wages are &s;eldom procured from their labour, except in harve&s;t, when they work in the pre&s;ence of their ma&s;ters. The wives and daughters of the German farmers frequently for&s;ake, for a while, their dairy and &s;pinning-wheel, and join their hu&s;bands and brothers in the labour of cutting down, collecting and bringing home the fruits of their fields and orchards The work of the gardens is generally done by the women of the family.</P>
<P N="11">11th. A large and &s;trong waggon covered with linen cloth, is an e&s;&s;ential part of the furniture of a German farm. In this waggon, drawn by four or five large hor&s;es of a peculiar breed: they convey to market over the roughe&s;t roads, between 2 or 3 thou|&s;and pounds weight of the produce of their farms. In
<PB N="233" REF="034495_0239_0FFE030BD8B79F18">
the months of September and October, it is no uncom|mon thing, on the Lanca&s;ter and Reading roads, to meet in one day from fifty to an hundred of the&s;e wag|gons, on their way to Philadelphia, mo&s;t of which be|long to German farmers.</P>
<P N="12">12th. The favourable influence of agriculture, as conducted by the Germans in extending human hap|pine&s;s, is manife&s;ted by the joy they expre&s;s upon the birth of a child. No dread of poverty, nor di&s;tru&s;t of Providence from an encrea&s;ing family, depre&s;s the &s;pirits of the&s;e indu&s;trious and frugal people. Upon the birth of a &s;on, they exult in the gift of a ploughman or a waggoner; and upon the birth of a daughter, they rejoice in the addition of another &s;pin&s;ter, or milkmaid to their family. Happy &s;tate of human &s;ociety! what ble&s;&s;ings can civilization confer, that can atone for the extinction of the ancient and patriarchal plea&s;ure of rai&s;ing up a numerous and healthy family of children, to labour for their parents, for them&s;elves, and for their country; and finally to partake of the knowledge and hap|pine&s;s which are annexed to exi&s;tence! The joy of pa|rents upon the birth of a child is the grateful echo of creating goodne&s;s. May the mountains of Penn&s;ylvania be for ever vocal, with &s;ongs of joy upon the&s;e occa&s;ions! They will be the infallible &s;igns of inno|cence, indu&s;try, wealth and happine&s;s in the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="13">13th. The Germans take great pains to produce, in their children, not only <HI>habits</HI> of labour, but a <HI>love</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="034495_0240_0FFE030E9D90C578">
of it. In this they &s;ubmit to the irrever&s;ible &s;entence inflicted upon man, in &s;uch a manner, as to convert the wrath of heaven into private and public happine&s;s. "To fear God, and to love work," are the fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons they teach their children. They prefer indu&s;trious ha|bits to money it&s;elf; hence, when a young man a&s;ks the con&s;ent of his father to marry the girl of his choice, he does not enquire &s;o much whether &s;he be rich or poor? or whether &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;ses any per&s;onal or mental accompli&s;hments&mdash;as whether &s;he be indu&s;trious, and acquainted with the duties of a good hou&s;e-wife?</P>
<P N="14">14th. The Germans &s;et a great value upon patrimo|nial property. This u&s;eful principle in human nature prevents much folly and vice in young people. It moreover leads to la&s;ting and exten&s;ive advantages, in the improvement of a farm; for what inducement can be &s;tronger in a parent to plant an orchard, to pre&s;erve fore&s;t-trees or to build a commodious and durable hou&s;e, than the idea, that they will all be po&s;&s;e&s;sed by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of generations, who &s;hall inherit his blood and name.</P>
<P N="15">15th. The German farmers are very much influenc|ed in planting and pruning trees, al&s;o in &s;owing and reaping, by the age and appearances of the moon. This attention to the &s;tate of the moon has been a&s;cribed to &s;uper&s;tition; but if the facts related by Mr. Wil&s;on in his ob&s;ervations upon climates are true, part of their &s;ucce&s;s in agriculture mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to their being &s;o much influenced by it.</P>
<P N="16"><PB N="235" REF="034495_0241_0FFE0313D310C0A8">16th. From the hi&s;tory that has been given of the German agriculture, it will hardly be nece&s;&s;ary to add that a German farm may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the farms of the other citizens of the &s;tate, by the &s;uperior &s;ize of their barns; the plain, but compact form of their hou&s;es; the height of their enclo&s;ures; the extent of their orchards; the fertility of their fields; the luxuri|ance of their meadows, and a general appearance of plenty and neatne&s;s in everything that belongs to them.</P>
<P>The German mechanic po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome of the traits of the character that has been drawn of the German farmer. His fir&s;t object is to become a freeholder; and hence we find few of them live in rented hou&s;es. The highe&s;t compliment that can be paid to them on entering their hou&s;es is to a&s;k them, "is this hou&s;e your own." They are indu&s;trious, frugal, punctual and ju&s;t. Since their &s;ettlement in Penn&s;ylvania, many of them have acquired a knowledge of tho&s;e mechanical arts, which are more immediately nece&s;&s;a|ry and u&s;eful in a new country; while they continue at the &s;ame time, to carry on the arts they impor|ted from Germany, with vigour and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>But the genius of the Germans of Penn&s;ylvania, is not confined to agriculture and the mechanical arts. Many of them have acquired great wealth by foreign and dome&s;tic commerce. As merchants they are can|did and punctual. The bank of North America has witne&s;&s;ed, from its fir&s;t in&s;titution, their fidelity to all their pecuniary engagements.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="034495_0242_0FFE03155B015098">Thus far have I de&s;cribed the <HI>individual</HI> character of &s;everal orders of the German citizens of Penn&s;ylvania. I &s;hall now take notice of &s;ome of their manners in a collective capacity. All the different &s;ects among them are particularly attentive to the religious educa|cation of their children, and to the e&s;tabli&s;hment and &s;upport of the chri&s;tian religion. For this purpo&s;e they &s;ettle as much as po&s;&s;ible together&mdash;and make the erection of a &s;chool hou&s;e and a place of wor&s;hip the fir&s;t object of their care. They commit the educa|tion and in&s;truction of their children in a peculiar manner to the mini&s;ters and officers of their churches; &mdash;hence they grow up with prejudices in favour of pub|lic wor&s;hip, and of the obligations of chri&s;tianity. Such has been the influence of a pious education among the German Lutherans in Penn&s;ylvania, that in the cour&s;e of nineteen years only one of them has ever been brought to a place of public &s;hame on puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>As members of civil government, the Germans are peaceable&mdash;and exact in the payment of their tax|es. Since they have participated in the power of the &s;tate, many of them have become &s;en&s;ible and enlightened in the &s;cience of legi&s;lation. Penn&s;ylvania has had the &s;peaker's chair of her a&s;&s;embly, and the vice-pre&s;ident's office of her council, filled with dignity by gentlemen of German families. The &s;ame gentlemen have &s;ince been advanced to &s;eats in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, under the new con&s;titution
<PB N="237" REF="034495_0243_0FFE0316EF1FD7C0">
of the United States. In the great controver&s;y about the national government, a large majority of the Germans in Penn&s;ylvania decided in favour of its adoption, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t popular arts were u&s;ed to prejudice them again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The Germans are but little addicted to convivial plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>They &s;eldom meet for the &s;imple purpo&s;e of eating and drinking in what are ju&s;tly called
<Q>feeding parties</Q>;
but they are not &s;trangers to the virtue of ho&s;pitality.&mdash;The hungry or benighted traveller, is always &s;ure to find a hearty welcome under their roofs. A gentleman of Iri&s;h extraction, who lo&s;t his way in travelling through Lanca&s;ter county, called late at night at the door of a German farmer. He was kindly received and entertained with the be&s;t of every thing the hou&s;e afforded. The next morning, he offered to pay his ho&s;t for his lodging, and other accommodations: "No" &s;aid the friendly German, in broken Engli&s;h&mdash;
<Q>I will take nothing from you. I was once lo&s;t, and entertained, as you have been, at the hou&s;e of a &s;tranger who would take no pay from me for his trouble. I am therefore now only di&s;charging that debt:&mdash; do you pay your debt to me in the &s;ame way to &s;omebody el&s;e.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>They are extremely kind and friendly as neighbours. They often a&s;&s;i&s;t each other by loans of money for
<PB N="238" REF="034495_0244_0FFE0319B20FAC80">
a &s;hort time, without intere&s;t, when the purcha&s;e of a plantation makes a larger &s;um nece&s;&s;ary than is commonly po&s;&s;e&s;sed by a &s;ingle farmer. To &s;ecure their confidence, it is nece&s;&s;ary to be punctual. They never lend money a &s;econd time, to a man who has once di&s;appointed them in paying what he had bor|rowed agreeably to his promi&s;e or obligation. It was remarked, during the late war, that there were very few in&s;tances of any of them di&s;charging a bond, or a debt, with depreciated paper money.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the Germans are deficient in learning; and that in con&s;equence of their want of more general and exten&s;ive education, they are much addicted to &s;uper&s;tition, and are frequently impo&s;ed upon in the management of their affairs. Many of them have lo&s;t valuable e&s;tates by being unacquainted with the common forms of law, in the mo&s;t &s;imple tran&s;actions; and many more of them have lo&s;t their lives, by applying to quacks in &s;ick|ne&s;s: but this objection to the Germans will &s;oon cea&s;e to have any foundation in Penn&s;ylvania. Seve|ral young men, born of German parents, have been educated in law, phy&s;ic and divinity, who have de|mon&s;trated by their abilities and knowledge, that the German genius for literature has not depreciated in America. A college has lately been founded by the &s;tate in Lanca&s;ter,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This college is called after Dr. FRANKLIN, who was pre&s;ident of the &s;tate at the time it was founded, and who contributed very liberally to its funds.</NOTE> and committed chiefly to the care
<PB N="239" REF="034495_0245_0FFE031EE8A194B0">
of the Germans of all &s;ects, for the purpo&s;e of diffu|&s;ing learning among their children. In this college they are to be taught the German and Engli&s;h lan|guages, and all tho&s;e branches of literature which are u&s;ually taught in the colleges of Europe and America. The principal of this college is a native of Penn&s;ylvania, of German parentage.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Reverend Dr. Monty Muldenberg.</NOTE> His exten&s;ive knowledge and ta&s;te in the arts and &s;ciences, joined with his indu&s;try in the di&s;charge of the duties of his &s;tation, have afforded to the friends of learning in Penn&s;ylvania, the mo&s;t flattering pro&s;pects of the future importance and u&s;efulne&s;s of this in&s;titution,</P>
<P>Both &s;exes of the Germans di&s;cover a &s;trong propen|&s;ity to vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic. They excel, in p&s;almody, all the other religious &s;ocieties in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The freedom and toleration of the government has produced a variety of &s;ects, among the Germans in Penn&s;ylvania. The Lutherans compo&s;e a great propor|tion of the German citizens of the &s;tate. Many of their churches are large and &s;plendid. The German Pre&s;byte|rians are the next to them in numbers. Their churches are likewi&s;e large and furni&s;hed, in many places, with organs. The clergy, belonging to the&s;e churches, have moderate &s;alaries, but they are punctually and ju&s;tly paid. In the country they have glebes which are &s;tocked and occa&s;ionally worked by their congregations. The
<PB N="240" REF="034495_0246_0FFE032070570BB8">
extra expences of their mini&s;ters, in all their excur&s;ions to their eccle&s;ia&s;tical meetings, are borne by their re&s;|pective congregations. By this means the di&s;cipline and general intere&s;ts of their churches are pre&s;erved and promoted. The German Lutherans and Pre&s;by|terians live in great harmony with each other, in&s;omuch that they often preach in each other's churches, and in &s;ome in&s;tances unite in building a church, in which they both wor&s;hip at different times. This harmony between two &s;ects, one &s;o much oppo&s;ed to each other, is owing to the relaxation of the Pre&s;byterians in &s;ome of the peculiar doctrines of Calvani&s;m. I have called them Pre&s;byterians, becau&s;e mo&s;t of them object to being de&s;ignated by the name of Calvani&s;ts. The Menoni&s;ts, the Moravians, the Swingfielders, and the Catholics, compo&s;e the other &s;ects of the German inha|bitants of Penn&s;ylvania. The Menoni&s;ts hold war and oaths to be unlawful. They admit the &s;acraments of bapti&s;m, by <HI>&s;prinkling,</HI> and the &s;upper. From them a &s;ect has ari&s;en, who hold, with the above principles and ceremonies, the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>immer&s;ion</HI> bapti&s;m; hence they are called <HI>Dunkers,</HI> or Bapti&s;ts. Previou&s;ly to their partaking of the &s;acrament of the &s;upper, they wa&s;h each other's feet, and &s;it down to a love-fea&s;t. They practice the&s;e ceremonies of their religion with great humility and &s;olemnity. They, moreover, hold the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation. From this &s;ect there have been &s;everal &s;eceders, one of whom devoted them&s;elves to perpetual celibacy. They have exhibited
<PB N="241" REF="034495_0247_0FFE0321F9A13068">
for many years, a curious &s;pectacle of pious mortifica|tion, at a village called Ephrata, in Lanca&s;ter county. They are at pre&s;ent reduced to fourteen or fifteen members. The <HI>Separati&s;ts</HI> who likewi&s;e di&s;&s;ented from the Dunkers, reject the ordinances of bapti&s;m and the &s;acrament; and hold the doctrine of the <HI>Friends,</HI> con|cerning the internal revelation of the go&s;pel. They hold, with the Dunkers, the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;al|vation. The &s;ingular piety, and exemplary morality of the&s;e &s;ects, have been urged, by the advocates for the &s;alvation of all mankind, as a proof that the belief of that doctrine is not &s;o unfriendly to morals, and the order of &s;ociety, as has been &s;uppo&s;ed. The Dunkers and Separati&s;ts agree in taking no intere&s;t upon money, and in not applying to law to recover their debts.</P>
<P>The German Moravians are a numerous and re&s;pec|table body of chri&s;tians in Penn&s;ylvania. In their village of Bethlehem, there are two large &s;tone buildings, in which the different &s;exes are educated in habits of indu&s;try in u&s;eful manufactures. The &s;i&s;ters (for by that epithet the women are called) all &s;leep in two large and neat apartments. Two of them watch over the re&s;t, in turns, every night, to afford relief from tho&s;e &s;udden indi&s;po&s;itions which &s;ometimes occur, in the mo&s;t healthy per&s;ons, in the hours of &s;leep. It is impo&s;&s;ible to record this fact, without pau&s;ing a moment to do homage to that religion, which pro|duces
<PB N="242" REF="034495_0248_0FFE0324CE9F87C0">
&s;o much union and kindne&s;s in human &s;ouls. The number of women, who belong to this &s;eque&s;t|ered female &s;ociety, amounts &s;ometimes to 120, and &s;eldom to le&s;s than 100. It is remarkable that not|with&s;tanding they lead a &s;edentary life, and &s;et con|&s;tantly in clo&s;e &s;tove-rooms in winter, that not more than one of them, upon an average, dies in a year. The di&s;ea&s;e which generally produces this annual death, is the con&s;umption. The conditions and ages of the women of the village, as well as of the &s;ociety that has been mentioned, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by ribbons of a peculiar kind which they wear on their caps: the widows, by white; the married women, by blue; the &s;ingle women, above 18 years of age, by pink; and tho&s;e under that age, by a ribbon of a cinnamon colour. Formerly this body of Moravians held all their property in common in imitation of the primi|tive chri&s;tians; but, in the year 1760, a divi&s;ion of the whole of it took place, except a tavern, a tan-yard, 2000 acres of land near Bethlehem, and 5000 acres near Nazareth, a village in the neigbourhood of Bethlehem. The profits of the&s;e e&s;tates are appropri|ated to the &s;upport and propagation of the go&s;pel. There are many valuable manufactures carried on at Bethlehem. The inhabitants po&s;&s;e&s;s a gentlene&s;s in their manners, which is peculiarly agreeable to &s;trangers. They inure their children, of five and &s;ix years old, to habits of early indu&s;try. By this means they are not only taught tho&s;e kinds of labor which are &s;uited to

their &s;trength and capacities, but are pre&s;erved from many of the hurtful vices and accidents to which children are expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Swingfielders are a &s;mall &s;ociety. They hold the &s;ame principles as the Friends, but they differ from them in u&s;ing p&s;almody in their wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The German Catholics are numerous in Philadelphia, and have &s;everal &s;mall chapels in other parts of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>There is an incorporated charitable &s;ociety of Germans in Philadelphia, who&s;e objects are their poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed countrymen.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e a German &s;ociety of labourers and journeymen mechanics, who contribute 2s. 6d. eight times a year, towards a fund, out of which they allow 30s. a week to each other's families, when the head of it is unable to work; and 7l. 10s to his widow, as &s;oon as he is taken from his family by death.</P>
<P>The Germans of Penn&s;ylvania, including all the &s;ects that have been mentioned, compo&s;e nearly one third part of the whole inhabitants of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The intercour&s;e of the Germans with each other, is kept up chiefly in their own language; but mo&s;t of their men, who vi&s;it the capital, and the trading or country towns of the &s;tate, &s;peak the Engli&s;h lan|guage.

A certain number of the laws of the &s;tate are now printed in German, for the benefit of tho&s;e of them who cannot read Engli&s;h. A large number of German news-papers are likewi&s;e circulated through the &s;tate, through which knowledge and intelligence have been conveyed, much to the advantage of the go|vernment. There is &s;carcely an in&s;tance of a German, of either &s;ex, in Penn&s;ylvania, that cannot <HI>read</HI>; but many of the wives and daughters of the German far|mers cannot <HI>write.</HI> The pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety among them renders this accompli&s;hment of little con&s;equence to their improvement or happine&s;s.</P>
<P>If it were po&s;&s;ible to determine the amount of all the property brought into Penn&s;ylvania by the pre&s;ent German inhabitants of the &s;tate, and their ance&s;tors, and then compare it with the pre&s;ent amount of their property, the contra&s;t would form &s;uch a monument of human <HI>indu&s;try</HI> and <HI>oeconomy</HI> as has &s;eldom been contemplated in any age or country.</P>
<P>I have been informed that there was an ancient prophecy which foretold, that

that if I have failed in doing them ju&s;tice, it has not been the fault of my &s;ubject. The German character once employed the pen of one of the fir&s;t hi&s;torians of antiquity. I mean the elegant and enlightened Tacitus. It is very remarkable that the Germans in Penn&s;ylvania retain in a great degree all the virtues, which this author a&s;cribes to their ance&s;tors in his treati&s;e "<HI>de moribus Germanorum</HI>".&mdash; They inherit their integrity&mdash;fidelity&mdash;and cha&s;tity&mdash; but chri&s;tianity has bani&s;hed from them, their drun|kenne&s;s, idlene&s;s, and love of military glory. There is a &s;ingular trait in the features of the German character in Penn&s;ylvania, which &s;hews how long the mo&s;t trifling cu&s;toms may exi&s;t among a people who have not been mixed with other nations. Tacitus de&s;cribes the manner in which the ancient Germans build their villages in the following words. "<HI>Suam qui&s;que domum &s;patiis circumdat &s;ive adver&s;us ca&s;us ignis remedium, &s;ive in&s;citia aedificandi.</HI>"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Each man leaves a &s;pace between his hou&s;e, and tho&s;e of his neigh|bours, either to avoid the danger from fire, or from un&s;kilfulne&s;, in architecture.</NOTE> Many of the German villages in Penn&s;ylvania are con&s;truc|ted in the &s;ame manner. The &s;mall hou&s;es are com|po&s;ed of a mixture, of wood, brick and clay, neatly united together. The large hou&s;es are built of &s;tone, and many of them after the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion.

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON COMMON SENSE.</HEAD>
<P>THE human mind in common with other branches of philo&s;ophy, has become the &s;ubject of attention in the pre&s;ent age of free and general enquiry. While new faculties are di&s;cover|ing in it, it will conduce equally to our acquiring a perfect knowledge of its powers, to detect and re|move &s;uch <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> faculties as do not belong to it.</P>
<P>I have long &s;u&s;pected the term <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> to be applied improperly to de&s;ignate a faculty of the mind. I &s;hall not repeat the accounts which have been given of it by Cicero&mdash;Buffier&mdash;Berkely&mdash;Shafte&s;bury &mdash;Bentely&mdash;Fenelon&mdash;Locke&mdash;Hume&mdash;Hobs&mdash;Prie&s;tly and others, all of whom agree in de&s;cribing it as a <HI>faculty,</HI> or <HI>part</HI> of a faculty, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a quick and univer&s;al perception of <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong, truth</HI> and <HI>er|ror,</HI> and of <HI>propriety</HI> and <HI>impropriety</HI> in human affairs.</P>
<P>I &s;hall copy, as the &s;ub&s;tance of all that tho&s;e au|thors have &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, Dr. Reid's ac|count of common &s;en&s;e, publi&s;hed in the 2d. chapter of the &s;ixth number of his E&s;&s;ays on the intellectual powers of man.&mdash;
<Q>It is ab&s;urd to conceive (&s;ays the Doctor) that there can be any oppo&s;ition be|tween rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e. It is the fir&s;t-born
<PB N="250" REF="034495_0256_0FFE033B72962E18">
of rea&s;on, and, as they are commonly joined together in &s;peech and writing, they are in&s;eparable in their nature.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We a&s;cribe to rea&s;on-two offices or two degrees. The fir&s;t is to judge of things &s;elf-evident; the &s;econd is to draw conclu&s;ions that are not &s;elf-evident from things that are. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is the province, and the &s;ole province, of common &s;en&s;e, and therefore it <HI>coincides</HI> with rea&s;on in its <HI>whole</HI> extent, and is only <HI>another</HI> name for one <HI>branch</HI> or one <HI>degree</HI> of rea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is an obvious rea&s;on why this degree of rea&s;on &s;hould have a name appropriated to it, and that is, that in the greate&s;t part of mankind no other degree of rea&s;on is to be found. It is this degree of rea&s;on that entitles them to the denomi|nation of rea&s;onable creatures.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e two degrees of rea&s;on differ in other re&s;pects, which would be &s;ufficient to entitle them to di&s;tinct names. The fir&s;t is the gift of heaven&mdash; the &s;econd is learned by practice and rules, when the fir&s;t is not wanting.</Q>
&mdash;Thus far Dr. Reid.</P>
<P>It is with great di&s;&s;idence that I object to any thing that comes from a gentleman from who&s;e writings I have derived &s;o much entertainment and in&s;truction, and who has done &s;o much towards removing the rubbi&s;h that has for many ages ob&s;cured the &s;cience of metaphy&s;icks. This diffidence to offer a &s;ingle ob|jection
<PB N="251" REF="034495_0257_0FFE0340AF411778">
to Dr. Reid's opinion upon the &s;ubject under con&s;ideration, is encrea&s;ed by the groupe of popular and re&s;pectable names under which he has &s;upported it.</P>
<P>The idea which I have adopted of common &s;en&s;e is plain and &s;imple. I con&s;ider it as the perception of things as they appear to the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> part of man|kind. It has no relation to their being <HI>true</HI> or <HI>fal&s;e, right</HI> or <HI>wrong, proper</HI> or <HI>improper.</HI> For the &s;ake of per&s;picuity, I &s;hall define it to be, <HI>Opinions and feelings in uni&s;on with the opinions and feelings of the bulk of mankind.</HI></P>
<P>From this definition it is evident that common &s;en&s;e mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily differ in different ages and countries and, in both, mu&s;t vary with the progre&s;s of ta&s;te, &s;cience, and religion. In the uncultivated &s;tate of rea&s;on, the opinions and feelings of a majority of mankind will be <HI>wrong,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, their com|mon or univer&s;al &s;en&s;e will partake of their errors. In the cultivated &s;tate of rea&s;on, <HI>ju&s;t</HI> opinions and feelings will become general, and the common &s;en&s;e of the majority will be in uni&s;on with truth. I beg leave to illu&s;trate what I mean by a few examples.</P>
<P N="1">1. There are many things which were contrary to common &s;en&s;e in former ages, both in philo&s;ophy and religion, which are now univer&s;ally believed, in&s;omuch that to call them in que&s;tion is to di&s;cover a want of judgment, or a defective education.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="252" REF="034495_0258_0FFE034237E81688">2. It is contrary to common &s;en&s;e to &s;peak or write in favour of republicani&s;m, in &s;everal Euro|pean countries; and it is equally contrary to it to &s;peak or write in favour of monarchy, in the United States of America.</P>
<P N="3">3. The common &s;en&s;e of the planters in Jamaica, is in favour of the commerce and &s;lavery of the Afri|cans.&mdash;In Penn&s;ylvania, rea&s;on, humanity, and com|mon &s;en&s;e, have univer&s;ally declared again&s;t them.</P>
<P N="4">4. In Turkey, it is contrary to the common &s;en&s;e of delicacy which prevails in that country for a gentle|man to dance with a lady. No &s;uch common &s;en&s;e prevails in any of the we&s;tern countries of Europe, or in the States of America.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is contrary to the common &s;en&s;e of many numerous &s;ects to believe that it is po&s;&s;ible for men to go to heaven, who do not embrace their principles, or mode of wor&s;hip.&mdash;Among rational men, this common &s;en&s;e is contrary to truth and chri&s;tian re|ligion.</P>
<P N="6">6. The common &s;en&s;e of mankind has generally been in favour of e&s;tabli&s;hed modes and habits of prac|tice, in medicine. Opium, bark, mercury and the lancet have all forced their way into general u&s;e, contrary to this common &s;en&s;e. Their utility is a proof how little common &s;en&s;e accords with the deci|&s;ions
<PB N="253" REF="034495_0259_0FFE0343C5FB2C78">
of rea&s;on, and how improperly it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a part of that noble power of the mind.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is agreeable to the common &s;en&s;e of a great part of mankind, to revenge public and private in|juries by wars and duels, and yet no wi&s;e or ju&s;t rea&s;on has ever been given to ju&s;tify the practice of either of them</P>
<P N="8">8. The common &s;en&s;e of the bulk of the inhabi|tants of the Briti&s;h dominions, and of the United States, is in favour of boys &s;pending four or five years in learning the Latin and Greek languages, in order to qualify them to under&s;tand the Engli&s;h language Tho&s;e per&s;ons who recollect that the mo&s;t perfect language in the world, viz. the Greek, was learned without the medium or aid of a dead or foreign lan|guage, con&s;ider the above practice (founded in com|mon &s;en&s;e) as contrary to right rea&s;on and productive of many evils in education. But further, under this head. The common &s;en&s;e of the &s;ame immen&s;e pro|portion of people, is in favour of teaching boys <HI>words,</HI> before they are taught <HI>ideas.</HI> Now nature and right rea&s;on both revolt at this ab&s;urd practice.</P>
<P N="9">9. The common &s;en&s;e of nearly all nations, is in favour of preventing crimes, by the puni&s;hment of death, but right rea&s;on, policy, and the experience of a wi&s;e and enlightened prince,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Leopold Emperor of Germany.</NOTE> all concur in proving
<PB N="254" REF="034495_0260_0FFE0347C4444518">
that the be&s;t means of preventing crimes, is by <HI>living</HI> and not by <HI>dead</HI> examples.</P>
<P>In the perfection of knowledge, common &s;en&s;e and truth will be in uni&s;on with each other. It is <HI>now more</HI> related to error than truth, and in the &s;en&s;e in which I have de&s;cribed it, it implies more prai&s;e than cen&s;ure to want it.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that a man has common &s;en&s;e, is to &s;ay that he thinks with his age or country, in their <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> as well as their <HI>true</HI> opinions; and the greater the proportion of people, he acts and thinks with, the greater &s;hare he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of this common &s;en&s;e.&mdash; After all that has been &s;aid in its favour, I cannot help thinking that it is the characteri&s;tic only of common minds.</P>
<P>To think and act with the majority of mankind, when they are <HI>right,</HI> and differently from them, when they are <HI>wrong,</HI> con&s;titutes in my opinion, the perfec|tion of human wi&s;dom and conduct.</P>
<P>The <HI>feelings</HI> and <HI>opinions</HI> of mankind are often confounded; but they are widely different from each other. There may be <HI>ju&s;t</HI> feelings connected with <HI>erro|neous</HI> opinions and conduct. This is often the ca&s;e in religion and government&mdash;But, in general, opinions and feelings are ju&s;t and unju&s;t in equal degrees, ac|cording to the circum&s;tances of age, country, and the progre&s;s of knowledge before mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="034495_0261_0FFE03494C5D19A0">Had this common &s;en&s;e depended upon the infor|mation of any one of the <HI>five external</HI> &s;en&s;es, I &s;hould have had no difficulty in admitting Dr. Reid's account of it, ina&s;much as the perceptions they afford are the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> in their nature, in all healthy men, and in all ages and countries. But to &s;uppo&s;e it to be an in|ferior degree, or the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> act of rea&s;on, and afterwards to &s;uppo&s;e it to be <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> is to contradict every thing that hi&s;tory and ob&s;ervation teach us of human nature.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, in his po&s;thumous works, &s;ays,

by which he mu&s;t have meant the <HI>com|mon</HI> degrees of it, or what is called, by Dr. Reid, <HI>common &s;en&s;e.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>In matters addre&s;&s;ed to our rea&s;on, the principal bu&s;ine&s;s of rea&s;on is to correct the evidence of our <HI>&s;en&s;es.</HI> Indeed, the perception of truth, in philo&s;ophy, &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in little el&s;e than in the refutation of the ideas acquired from the te&s;timony of our &s;en&s;es. In the progre&s;s of knowledge, when the ex|act connection between the &s;en&s;es and rea&s;on is per|fectly under&s;tood, it is probable that the &s;en&s;es and rea&s;on will be in uni&s;on with each other, and that mankind will as &s;uddenly connect the evidence of all the &s;en&s;es with the deci&s;ions of rea&s;on, as they now connect, with certainty, the di&s;tance of objects with the evidence of the eyes. This general uni&s;on be|tween the &s;en&s;es and rea&s;on, as in the ca&s;e of vi&s;ion, mu&s;t be the re&s;ult only of experience and habit.</P>
<P>I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject without adding the following remark.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="034495_0262_0FFE034D47B16410">Mankind are governed, &s;ays Mr. Bayle, by their prejudices, and not by their principles.

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE VICES PECULIAR TO THE IN|DIANS OF NORTH AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>IT has become fa&s;hionable of late years for the philo&s;ophers of Europe to celebrate the vir|tues of the &s;avages of America.&mdash;Whether the de&s;ign of their encomiums was to expo&s;e chri&s;tianity, and depreciate the advantages of civilization, I know not; but they have evidently had tho&s;e effects upon the minds of weak people. Without contradicting the accounts that have been publi&s;hed by tho&s;e gentlemen, of the virtues of the Indians in North America, I &s;hall briefly add an account of &s;ome of their vices, in order to complete their natural hi&s;tory. My information &s;hall be taken from the travels of Charlevoix&mdash;Hen|nepen&mdash;Carver&mdash;Romans and Bartram, and from con|ver&s;ations with per&s;ons of veracity who have re&s;ided among them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t vice I &s;hall name, that is univer&s;al among our &s;avages, is UNCLEANNESS. They are, in general, &s;trangers to the obligations both of morality and de|cency, as far as they relate to the marriage bed.&mdash;The exceptions to this remark, have been produced among tho&s;e nations chiefly, who have had an occa&s;ional in|tercour&s;e with civilized nations.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="258" REF="034495_0264_0FFE0351B3124F70">2. NASTINESS is another Indian vice. This is ex|emplified in their food&mdash;drinks&mdash;dre&s;s&mdash;per&s;ons&mdash;and above all, in their total di&s;regard to decency in the <HI>time&mdash;place</HI>&mdash;and <HI>manner</HI> of their natural evacuations.</P>
<P N="3">3. DRUNKENNESS is a more general vice among &s;a|vages than among civilized nations.&mdash;Whole Indian tribes have been de&s;troyed by it. Indeed they glory in their fondne&s;s for &s;trong liquors, and con&s;ider it as a part of their character. A countryman who had dropt from his cart a keg of rum, rode back a few miles in hopes of finding it. On his way he met an Indian who lived in his neighbourhood, whom he a&s;ked if he had &s;een his keg of rum on the road? The Indian laughed in his face, and addre&s;&s;ed him in the following words.
<Q>What a fool you are to a&s;k an Indian &s;uch a que&s;tion. Don't you &s;ee I am &s;ober? Had I met with your keg, you would have found it empty on one &s;ide of the road, and Indian Tom drunk and a&s;leep on the other.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. GLUTTONY is very common among Indians. To this their long ab&s;tinence, produced by their idle|ne&s;s, naturally tempts them.&mdash;It is very common to &s;ee them &s;tretch them&s;elves on the ground after a full meal, and grunt there for &s;everal hours till they reco|ver from the effects of their intemperance. Mr. Bartram tells us, that they &s;ometimes ri&s;e in the middle of the night, in order to gratify their appetites for eating.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="259" REF="034495_0265_0FFE0356EF009F90">5. TREACHERY is another Indian vice. Who ever tru&s;ted to an Indian treaty?&mdash;They generally begin their wars, with profe&s;&s;ions of peace and perpetual friend&s;hip.</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>cruelty</HI> of Indians is well known. They con&s;ider compa&s;&s;ion as a mark of effeminacy. Their treatment of their pri&s;oners, &s;hews them to po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;pirit of revenge, which places them upon a footing with infernal &s;pirits.</P>
<P N="7">7. IDLENESS is the univer&s;al vice of &s;avages.&mdash; They are not only too lazy to work, but even to think. Nothing but the powerful &s;timulus of hunger, or revenge, is &s;ufficient to rou&s;e them into action.</P>
<P N="8">8. THEFT is an Indian vice. The Indians not only &s;teal from their civilized neighbours, but from each other. A hor&s;e&mdash;a gun&mdash;or &s;pirits, have charms in the eyes of an Indian that no re&s;traints can prevent his &s;tealing, whenever they come in his way.</P>
<P N="9">9. GAMING belongs in an eminent degree to the Catalogue of Indian vices.</P>
<P N="10">10. But the infamy of the Indian character is completed by the low rank to which they degrade their women. It is well known that their women perform all their work. They not only prepare their victuals, but plant, hoe and gather their corn and roots. They are &s;eldom admitted to their fea&s;ts, or &s;hare in their conver&s;ation. The men oblige them
<PB N="260" REF="034495_0266_0FFE0358777E0A18">
to lie at their feet, when they &s;leep <HI>without</HI> fire; and at their backs when they &s;leep <HI>before</HI> a fire. They afford them no a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the toils of tending, feed|ing, and carrying their children. They are even in|&s;en&s;ible of the dangers to which their women are often expo&s;ed in travelling with them. A gentleman from Northumberland county, informed me, that he once &s;aw a body of Indian men and women wading acro&s;s the river Su&s;quehannah. The men arrived fir&s;t on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, and pur&s;ued their journey along the river. The women, &s;ome of whom had children on their backs, upon coming to a deep and rapid current, &s;uddenly cried out for help, and made &s;igns to their hu&s;bands and fathers to come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The men &s;tood for a few minutes&mdash;and after atten|tively &s;urveying their di&s;tre&s;s, bur&s;ted out a laughing, and then with a merry indifference, walked from them along the &s;hore.</P>
<P>This is a &s;hort nomenclature of the vices of the In|dians of North America. If it were nece&s;&s;ary, I would quote the chapters and pages of the authors who have e&s;tabli&s;hed by their ob&s;ervations, the truth of the cha|racter I have given of them. I am not di&s;po&s;ed to enter into an examination of their virtues, but I can|not help &s;uppo&s;ing them to be rather the <HI>qualities of nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> than the offspring of feeling, or principle. Their ho&s;pitality&mdash;their friend&s;hips&mdash;their patience &mdash;and their fidelity to engagements, are the effects of nece&s;&s;ity, and are as e&s;&s;ential to their exi&s;tence, a
<PB N="261" REF="034495_0267_0FFE035B40C12550">
hone&s;ty is to a band of a&s;&s;ociated robbers. Their po|litene&s;s in never contradicting any per&s;on, I believe is the effect of indolence, for I know of nothing that lazy people di&s;like more than to di&s;pute, even where truth is on their &s;ide, or where victory is certain.&mdash;Where is the man that in a lazy fit (to which all men at times are &s;ubject) has not heard fal&s;e and ab&s;urd opinions advanced in company, without con|tradicting them?</P>
<P>The taciturnity of the Indians which has been &s;o much celebrated, as a mark of their wi&s;dom, is the effect of their want of ideas. Except in ca&s;es of extraordinary pride, I believe taciturnity, in nine ca&s;es out of ten in civilized company, is the effect of &s;tupidity. I will make one more exception to this rule, and that is in favour of tho&s;e people who are in the habits of communicating their thoughts, by writing for the public, or by corre&s;ponding with their friends. Ideas, whether acquired from books, or by reflection, produce a plethora in the mind, which can only be relieved by depletion from the pen, or tongue.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall we &s;ay to the encomiums that have been lavi&s;hed upon the love of liberty which cha|racterizes our &s;avage neighbours?&mdash;Why&mdash;that they ari&s;e from an ignorance of the influence of property, upon the human mind.&mdash;Property, and a regard for law, are born together in all &s;ocieties. The pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="262" REF="034495_0268_0FFE035D0A3B6E38">
for liberty in an Indian, is as different from the pa&s;&s;ion for it in a civilized republican, as the impurity of lu&s;t, is from the delicacy of love There is a certain medium to be ob&s;erved between an affection for law, and for liberty. An exce&s;s of the former has &s;ometimes led to tyranny, while an exce&s;s of the latter, leads to idlene&s;s and vice. The Athenians appear to have been intoxicated with an exce&s;s of liberty when they &s;pent their whole time in hearing and telling news. There is always an exce&s;s of law or liberty in a community where poor men are idle, or where vices of any kind are &s;uffered with impunity.</P>
<P>The only reflections that I &s;hall add upon this &s;ubject, &s;hall be,&mdash;how great are the ble&s;&s;ings of civil government which extirpates, re&s;trains, or puni&s;hes the vices that have been mentioned! and how great is the efficacy of chri&s;tianity, which, by purifying the heart, renders the practice of the contrary virtues natural and agreeable?</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS UPON THE INFLUENCE OF THE HABI|TUAL USE OF TOBACCO UPON HEALTH, MORALS, AND PROPERTY.</HEAD>
<P>WERE it po&s;&s;ible for a being who had re|&s;ided upon our globe, to vi&s;it the inhabitants of a planet, where rea&s;on governed, and to tell them that a vile weed was in general u&s;e among the inhabitants of the globe it had left, which afforded no nouri&s;hment&mdash;that this weed was culti|vated with immen&s;e care&mdash;that it was an important article of commerce&mdash;that the want of it produced real mi&s;ery&mdash;that its ta&s;te was extremely nau&s;eous, that it was unfriendly to health and morals, and that its u&s;e was attended with a con&s;iderable lo&s;s of time and property, the account would be thought incredible, and the author of it would probably be excluded from &s;ociety, for relating a &s;tory of &s;o improbable a nature. In no one view, is it po&s;&s;ible to contemplate the creature man in a more ab&s;urd and ridiculous light, than in his attachment to TOBACCO.</P>
<P>This weed is of a &s;timulating nature, whether it be u&s;ed in &s;moaking, chewing or in &s;nuff. Like Opium and &s;pirituous liquors, it is &s;ought for in all tho&s;e ca&s;es where the body is debilitated <HI>indirectly</HI> by intemperance in eating, or by exce&s;&s;ive application to &s;tudy, or bu&s;ine&s;s, or <HI>directly</HI> by &s;edative pa&s;&s;ions of the mind,

particularly by grief and fear. Per&s;ons after lo&s;ing relations or friends by death, often re&s;ort to it. One of the greate&s;t &s;nuffers I ever knew, u&s;ed it for the fir&s;t time, in order to con&s;ole her under a pre&s;entiment &s;he entertained, that &s;he &s;hould die in childbed. Fear creates a de&s;ire for Tobacco. Hence it is u&s;ed in a greater quantity by &s;oldiers and &s;ailors than by other cla&s;&s;es of people. It is u&s;ed mo&s;t profu&s;e|ly by &s;oldiers when they act as picket guards, or centi|nels, and by &s;ailors in &s;tormy weather. Per&s;ons labouring under that &s;tate of madne&s;s which is ac|companied with a &s;en&s;e of mi&s;ery, are much devoted to it, hence the tenants of mad-hou&s;es often acco&s;t their attendants and vi&s;itors, with petitions for Tobacco.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of habit in the u&s;e of Tobacco is exactly the &s;ame as in the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors. The &s;laves of it begin, by u&s;ing it only after dinner&mdash; then during the whole afternoon, and evening, after|wards before dinner, then before breakfa&s;t, and fi|nally during the whole night. I knew a Lady who had pa&s;&s;ed through all the&s;e &s;tages, who u&s;ed to wake regularly two or three times every night to compo&s;e her &s;y&s;tem with fre&s;h do&s;es of &s;nuff. Again &mdash;the progre&s;s in the decay of the &s;en&s;ibility of the no&s;e to the &s;timulus of &s;nuff is analogous to the decay of the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;tomach, to the &s;timulus of &s;pirituous liquors. It feels for a while the action of Rappee; next it requires Scotch &s;nuff, afterwards Iri&s;h-blackguard&mdash;and finally it is affected only by a
<PB N="265" REF="034495_0271_0FFE0365513DB240">
compo&s;ition of Tobacco and ground gla&s;s. This mix|ture is to the no&s;e, what Cayenne pepper and Jamaica &s;pirits are to the &s;tomachs of habitual dram drink|ers.</P>
<P>The appetite for Tobacco is wholly artificial. No per&s;on was ever born with a reli&s;h for it. Even in tho&s;e per&s;ons who are much attached to it, nature fre|quently recovers her di&s;reli&s;h to it. It cea&s;es to be agreeable in every &s;ebrile indi&s;po&s;ition. This is &s;o invariably true, that a di&s;reli&s;h to it is often a &s;ign of an approaching, and a return of the appetite for it, a &s;ign of a departing fever.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the pernicious effects of Tobacco, I &s;hall begin agreeably to the order I have laid down, by taking notice of its influence upon health; and here I &s;hall mention its effects not only upon the body, but upon the mind.</P>
<P N="1">1. It impairs the appetite. Where it does not pro|duce this effect,</P>
<P N="2">2. It prevents the early and complete dige&s;tion of the food, and thereby induces di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and incu|rable di&s;ea&s;es not only of the &s;tomach, but of the whole body. This effect of Tobacco is the re&s;ult of the wa&s;te of the &s;aliva in chewing, and &s;moking, or of the Tobacco in&s;inuating it&s;elf into the &s;tomach, when u&s;ed in chewing, or &s;nuffing.&mdash;I once lo&s;t a young man of 17 years of age, of a pulmonary con&s;ump|tion,
<PB N="266" REF="034495_0272_0FFE0368149DEC70">
who&s;e di&s;order was brought on by the intempe|rate u&s;e of &s;egars.</P>
<P N="3">3. It produces many of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;eated in the nerves. The late Sir John Pringle was &s;ubject in the evening of his life to tremors in his hands. In his la&s;t vi&s;it to France, a few years before he died, in company with Dr. Franklin, he was reque&s;ted by the Doctor to ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame di&s;order was very common among tho&s;e people of fa&s;hion who were great &s;nuffers. Sir John was led by this remark to &s;u&s;pect that his tremors were occa&s;ioned by &s;nuff which he took in large quantities. He immediately left off taking it, and &s;oon afterwards recovered the perfect u&s;e of his hands. I have &s;een head-ache, vertigo, and epilep&s;y produced by the u&s;e of Tobacco. A Phy&s;ician in Connecticut has remarked that it has in &s;everal in&s;tances produced pal&s;y and apoplexy, and Dr. Ti&s;&s;ot a&s;cribes &s;udden death in one in&s;tance, to the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of it in &s;moking.</P>
<P N="4">4. A citizen of Philadelphia lo&s;t all his teeth by drawing the hot &s;moke of Tobacco into his mouth by means of &s;hort pipe, and I have been informed of a cancer on the lip which terminated fatally from the &s;ame cau&s;e, in a farmer in Northumberland coun|ty in this &s;tate. The acrid nature of the matter which is mixed with the &s;moke of the Tobacco may ea&s;ily be di&s;covered by the ta&s;te or &s;mell of a pipe &s;tem that has been in u&s;e for two or three weeks.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="267" REF="034495_0273_0FFE036D4F578550">5. Tobacco when u&s;ed in the form of &s;nuff &s;eldom fails of impairing the voice by ob&s;tructing the no&s;e. It moreover imparts to the complexion a di&s;agreeable du&s;ky colour.</P>
<P>I have thus briefly enumerated the morbid effects of Tobacco upon the human body. It remains un|der this head to mention, that the want of it is a &s;ource of unea&s;ine&s;s more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing than many bodily di&s;orders. This unea&s;ine&s;s in per&s;ons who have long been accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of Tobacco has in &s;ome in&s;tances produced an agitation of mind that has bordered upon di&s;traction. Colonel Burr informed me that the greate&s;t complaints of di&s;&s;atisfaction and &s;uffering that he heard among the &s;oldiers who accom|panied General Arnold in his march from Bo&s;ton to Quebec through the wilderne&s;s in the year 1775, were from the want of Tobacco. This was the more remarkable, as they were &s;o de&s;titute of provi&s;ions as to be obliged to kill, and eat their dogs. The Per|&s;ians, we are told by travellers, often expatriate them|&s;elves, when they are forbidden the u&s;e of Tobacco, in order to enjoy it in a foreign country. The&s;e facts will not &s;urprize tho&s;e per&s;ons who have been accu&s;|tomed to view our appetites when perverted to &s;uch things as are artificial and di&s;agreeable, to be much more ungovernable than the appetite for things that are originally natural and agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="034495_0274_0FFE036ED5DCFC20">But the u&s;e of Tobacco has been known to produce a more &s;erious effect upon the mind than the di&s;tre&s;s that has been mentioned. Sir John Pringle's memory was impaired by &s;nuff. This was proved by his re|covering the perfect exerci&s;e of it after he left off tak|ing &s;nuff agreeably to the advice of his friend Dr. Franklin. Dr. Ma&s;illac informed me that his father lo&s;t his memory at forty years of age by the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;nuff. He took for &s;everal years two ounces of it every day.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the&s;e ob&s;ervations upon the morbid effects of Tobacco it has been &s;aid,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many medical virtues. I grant it, and the facts which e&s;tabli&s;h its utility in medicine furni&s;h us with additional arguments again&s;t the <HI>habitual</HI> u&s;e of it. How feeble would be the effects of opium, and bark upon the body if they con&s;titu|ted a part of the condiments of our daily food;&mdash; While I admit the efficacy of Tobacco as a medicine, I cannot help adding, that &s;ome of the di&s;ea&s;es, or &s;ymptoms of di&s;ea&s;es which it relieves, are evidently induced by the habit of u&s;ing it. Thus a dram of ardent &s;pirits &s;u&s;pends, for a while, a vomiting and tremors of the hands, but who does not know that tho&s;e complaints, are the effects of the intemperate and habitual u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors?</P>
<P N="2">2. The advocates for Tobacco, tell us that &s;mok|ing, and &s;nuff relieve that unea&s;ine&s;s which &s;ucceeds
<PB N="269" REF="034495_0275_0FFE03705FBF1728">
a plentiful meal. I admit that the &s;timulars of the Tobacco re&s;tores the &s;y&s;tem from the indirect weak|ne&s;s which is induced by intemperance in eating, but the relief which is thus obtained, illy compen&s;ates for the wa&s;te of the &s;aliva in &s;moking, at a time when it is mo&s;t wanted, or for the mixture of a portion of the Tobacco with the aliment in the &s;tomach by means of &s;nuffing. But why &s;hould we cure one evil by producing another? would it not be much better to obviate the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing Tobacco by always eat|ing a moderate meal? The recollection of the remedy probably di&s;po&s;es to that intemperance in eating which produces the unea&s;ine&s;s that has been mentioned.</P>
<P N="3">3. We are &s;ometimes told that Tobacco is a pre|&s;ervative from contagious di&s;ea&s;es. But many facts contradict this a&s;&s;ertion. Mr. Howard informs us that it had no efficacy in checking the contagion of the plague, and repeated experience in Philadelphia has proved, that it is equally ineffectual in pre&s;erv|ing tho&s;e who u&s;e it, from the Influenza and Yellow Fever.</P>
<P N="4">4. It has been further &s;aid that chewing and &s;mok|ing Tobacco a&s;&s;i&s;t the intellectual operations. So do wine, and di&s;tilled &s;pirits, but &s;hall we upon that account, have recour&s;e to tho&s;e liquors when we wi&s;h to &s;timulate our thinking faculties? Tea and Coffee are to be preferred, when we wi&s;h to &s;timulate the mind. Mr. Pope recommends a trotting hor&s;e for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Rou&s;&s;eau excited his invention by
<PB N="270" REF="034495_0276_0FFE0373236D8CB0">
walking backwards and forwards in his room. I &s;u&s;pect that Tobacco is often u&s;ed, rather to &s;upply the <HI>want</HI> of ideas than to <HI>collect,</HI> or excite them. The ab&s;ence of &s;en&s;ation, whether of external impre&s;&s;i|ons upon the body, or of the re-action of the mind in thought, is always accompanied with mi&s;ery. The Indians afford a &s;triking proof of this remark&mdash;hence they &s;pend whole days and even weeks in &s;moking, in order to relieve them&s;elves from the angui&s;h which attends the inactivity and vacuum of their minds.</P>
<P>We proceed next to mention the influence of the habitual u&s;e of Tobacco upon morals.</P>
<P N="1">1. One of the u&s;ual effects of &s;moking and chewing is thir&s;t. This thir&s;t cannot be allayed by water, for no &s;edative or even in&s;ipid liquor will be reli&s;hed after the mouth and throat have been expo&s;ed to the &s;timulus of the &s;moke, or juice of Tobacco. A de&s;ire of cour&s;e is excited for &s;trong drinks, and the&s;e when taken between meals &s;oon lead to intemperance and drunkenne&s;s. One of the greate&s;t &s;ots I ever knew, acquired a love for ardent &s;pirits by &s;wallowing cuds of Tobacco, which he did, to e&s;cape detection in the u&s;e of it, for he had contracted the habit of chewing, contrary to the advice and commands of his father. He died of a Drop&s;y under my care in the year 1780.</P>
<P N="2">2. The u&s;e of Tobacco, more e&s;pecially in &s;mok|ing&punc; di&s;po&s;es to idlene&s;s, and idlene&s;s has been con|&s;idered
<PB N="271" REF="034495_0277_0FFE037862464AC0">
as the root of all evil.
<Q>An idle man's brain, (&s;ays the celebrated and original Mr. Bunyan) is the Devil's work &s;hop.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. The u&s;e of Tobacco is nece&s;&s;arily connected with the neglect of cleanline&s;s. The influence of this neglect upon morals has been happily pointed out in an extract from captain Cooke's journal, which is publi&s;hed by Sir John Pringle in one of his Orations before the Royal Society of London.</P>
<P N="4">4. Tobacco, more e&s;pecially when u&s;ed in &s;moking, is generally <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> to tho&s;e people who do not u&s;e it. To &s;moke in company under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, is a breach of good manners; now, man|ners have an influence upon morals. They may be con&s;idered as the out po&s;ts of virtue. A habit of offending the &s;en&s;es of friends or &s;trangers by the u&s;e of Tobacco, cannot therefore be indulged with inno|cence. It produces a want of re&s;pect for our fellow creatures, and this always di&s;po&s;es to unkind and unju&s;t behaviour towards them. Who ever knew a rude man completely, or uniformly moral?</P>
<P>The methodi&s;ts forbad the u&s;e of Tobacco in the infancy of their &s;ociety. The prohibition di&s;covered a high and ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the &s;elf-denial, decency, and univer&s;al civility which are required by the go&s;pel. What reception may we &s;uppo&s;e would the apo&s;tles have met with, had they carried into the cities and hou&s;es to which they were &s;ent, &s;nuff-boxes, pipes,
<PB N="272" REF="034495_0278_0FFE0379E95AD290">
&s;egars, and bundles of cut, or rolls of hog, or pigtail Tobacco? Such a co&s;tly and offen&s;ive apparatus for gratifying their appetites, would have furni&s;hed &s;olid objections to their per&s;ons and doctrines, and would have been a ju&s;t cau&s;e for the clamors and contempt which were excited again&s;t them. It is agreeable to ob|&s;erve that a regard to good manners, upon this &s;ubject, has at la&s;t awakened in &s;ome parts of the world. In England &s;moking is not permitted in taverns and coffee hou&s;es until after 10 o'clock at night, and in France &s;nuffing is becoming unfa&s;hionable and vulgar. How much is it to be lamented that while the u&s;e of Tobacco is declining in two of the mo&s;t enlightned countries in Europe, it is becoming more general in America. Who can &s;ee groups of boys of &s;ix or eight years old in our &s;treets &s;moking &s;egars, without anticipating &s;uch a depreciation of our po&s;|terity in health and character, as can &s;carcely be contemplated at this di&s;tance of time without pain and horror!</P>
<P>It remains now that I briefly point out the influ|ence of the u&s;e of Tobacco upon time and property. Snuffing makes a great inroad upon time. A man who takes a pinch of &s;nuff every twenty minutes, (which mo&s;t habitual &s;nuffers do) and &s;nuffs fifteen hours in four and twenty, (allowing him to con&s;ume not quite half a minute every time he u&s;es his box,) will wa&s;te about five whole days of every year of his life in this u&s;ele&s;s, and unwhole&s;ome practice. But
<PB N="273" REF="034495_0279_0FFE037B7249B3F8">
when we add to the profitable u&s;e to which this time might have been applied, the expen&s;es of Tobacco, pipes, &s;nuff and &s;pitting boxes&mdash;and of the injuries which are done to the cloathing, during a whole life, the aggregate &s;um would probably amount to &s;everal hundred dollars. To a labouring man this would be a decent portion for a &s;on or daughter, while the &s;ame &s;um, &s;aved by a man in affluent circum&s;tances, would have enabled him by a contribution to a public charity to have le&s;&s;ened a large portion of the igno|rance, or mi&s;ery of mankind.</P>
<P>In reviewing the account that has been given of the di&s;agreeable and mi&s;chievous effects of Tobacco, we are led to enquire, what are its u&s;es upon our globe,&mdash;for we are a&s;&s;ured that nothing, exi&s;ts in vain. Poi&s;on is a relative term, and the mo&s;t noxious plants have been di&s;covered to afford &s;u&s;tenance to certain animals. But what animal be&s;ides man, will take Tobacco into its mouth? Hor&s;es, Cows, Sheep, Cats, Dogs, and even hogs refu&s;e to ta&s;te it. Flies, Mo&s;quitoes, and the moth are cha&s;ed from our cloaths by the &s;mell of it. But let us not arraign the wi&s;dom and oeconomy of nature in the production of this plant. Modern Travellers have at la&s;t di&s;covered that it con&s;titutes the food of a &s;olitary and filthy wild bea&s;t, well known in the de&s;arts of Africa, by the name of the ROCK GOAT.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="034495_0280_0FFE037E36BE1190">I &s;hall conclude the&s;e ob&s;ervations by relating an Anecdote of the late Dr. Franklin. A few months before his death, he declared to one of his friends that he had never u&s;ed Tobacco in any way in the cour&s;e of his long life, and that he was di&s;po&s;ed to believe there was not much advantage to be derived from it, for that he had never met with a man who u&s;ed it, who advi&s;ed him to follow his example.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE SUGAR MAPLE-TREE OF THE UNITED STATES. IN A LETTER TO THOMAS JEFFER|SON, ESQ. THEN SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND ONE OF VICE PRESIDENTS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to your reque&s;t, I have &s;at down to communicate to our Society through the medium of a letter to you, a &s;hort account of the <HI>Sugar Maple-tree</HI> of the United States, together with &s;uch facts and remarks as I have been able to collect, upon the methods of obtaining Sugar from it, and upon the advantages both public and private, of this Sugar.</P>
<P>The <HI>Acer Sacharinum</HI> of Linnaeus, or the Sugar Ma|ple-tree, grows in great quantities in the we&s;tern counties of all the Middle States of the American Union. Tho&s;e which grow in New-York and Penn|&s;ylvania yield the Sugar in a greater quantity than tho&s;e which grow on the waters of the Ohio.&mdash; The&s;e trees are generally found mixed with the Beech, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Fagus Ferruginea.</NOTE> Hemlock, <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Pinus abies.</NOTE> White and water A&s;h, <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Fraxinus Ame|ricana.</NOTE> the Cucumber tree, <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Magnolia acuminata.</NOTE> Linden, <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Tilia Americana.</NOTE> A&s;pen, <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Po|pulus tremula.</NOTE> Butter Nut, <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Juglans alba (oblonga.)</NOTE> and Wild Cherry trees <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Prunus Virginiana, of Linnaeus:</NOTE>. They &s;ometimes appear in groves covering five or &s;ix acres in a body,
<PB N="276" REF="034495_0282_0FFE0384FA1C05B8">
but they are more commonly inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;ome, or all of the fore&s;t trees which have been mentioned. From 30 to 50 trees are generally found upon an acre of ground. They grow only in the riche&s;t &s;oils and frequently in &s;tony ground. Springs of the pure&s;t water abound in their neighbourhood. They are when fully grown as tall as the white and black oaks, and from two to three feet in diameter.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Baron La Hontan, in his voyage to North America, gives the follow|ing account of the Maple-tree in Canada. After de&s;cribing the black Cherry-tree, &s;ome of which he &s;ays are as tall as the loftie&s;t oak, and as big as a hog&s;head, he adds,
<Q>The Maple-tree is much of the &s;ame height and bulk. It bears no re&s;emblance to that &s;ort we have in Europe.</Q></NOTE> They put forth a beautiful white blo&s;&s;om in the Spring before they &s;how a &s;ingle leaf. The colour of the blo&s;om di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the <HI>acer rubrum,</HI> or the common maple, which affords a blo&s;&s;om of a red colour. The wood of the Sugar Maple-tree is ex|tremely inflammable, and is preferred upon that account by hunters and &s;urveyors for fire-wood. Its &s;mall branches are &s;o much impregnated with &s;ugar as to afford &s;upport to the cattle, hor&s;es, and &s;heep of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers during the winter, before they are able to cultivate forage for that purpo&s;e. Its a&s;hes afford a great quantity of pot a&s;h, exceeded by few, or perhaps by none of the trees that grow in the woods of the United States.</P>
<P>The tree is &s;uppo&s;ed to arrive at its full growth in the woods in twenty years.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="034495_0283_0FFDC64F0A3F5A20">It is not injured by tapping; on the contrary, the oftner it is tapped, the more &s;yrup is obtained from it. In this re&s;pect it follows a law of animal &s;ecre|tion. A &s;ingle tree has not only &s;urvived, but flouri&s;h|ed after <HI>forty-two</HI> tappings in the &s;ame number of years. The effects of a yearly di&s;charge of &s;ap from the tree in improving and increa&s;ing the &s;ap, is demon|&s;trated from the &s;uperior excellence of tho&s;e trees which have been perforated in an hundred places, by a &s;mall wood-pecker which feeds upon the &s;ap. The trees after having been wounded in this way, di&s;til the remains of their juice on the ground, and after|wards acquire a black colour. The &s;ap of the&s;e trees is much &s;weeter to the ta&s;te than that which is obtain|ed from trees which have not been previou&s;ly wound|ed, and it affords more &s;ugar.</P>
<P>From twenty-three gallons and one quart of &s;ap pro|cured in twenty hours from only two of the&s;e dark coloured trees, Arthur Noble, E&s;q. of the &s;tate of New-York, obtained four pounds and thirteen ounces of good grained &s;ugar.</P>
<P>A tree of an ordinary &s;ize yields in a good &s;ea&s;on from twenty to thirty gallons of &s;ap, from which are made from five to &s;ix pounds of &s;ugar. To this there are &s;ometimes remarkable exceptions. Samuel Low, E&s;q. a Ju&s;tice of Peace in Montgomery county, in the &s;tate of New-York, informed Arthur Noble, E&s;q. that he had made twenty pounds and one ounce of
<PB N="278" REF="034495_0284_0FFE03894CC4D450">
&s;ugar between the 14th and 23d of April, in the year 1789, from a &s;ingle tree that had been tapped for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years before.</P>
<P>From the influence which culture has upon fore&s;t and other trees, it has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that by tran&s;|planting the Sugar Maple tree into a garden, or by de&s;troying &s;uch other trees as &s;helter it from the rays of the Sun, the quantity of the &s;ap might be increa&s;ed; and its quality much improved. I have heard of one fact which favours this opinion. A farmer in Northampton county in the &s;tate of Penn|&s;ylvania, planted a number of the&s;e trees above twenty years ago in his meadow, from <HI>three</HI> gallons of the &s;ap of which he obtains every year a pound of &s;ugar. It was remarked formerly that it required <HI>five</HI> or <HI>&s;ix</HI> gallons of the &s;ap of the trees which grow in the woods, to produce the &s;ame quantity of &s;ugar.</P>
<P>The &s;ap di&s;tils from the <HI>wood</HI> of the tree. Trees which have been cut down in the winter for the &s;upport of the dome&s;tic animals of the new &s;ettlers, yield a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;ap as &s;oon as their trunks and limbs feel the rays of the Sun in the &s;pring of the year.</P>
<P>It is in con&s;equence of the &s;ap of the&s;e trees being equally diffu&s;ed through every part of them, that they live three years after they are <HI>girdled,</HI> that is, after a circular inci&s;ion is made through the bark into the &s;ub&s;tance of the tree for the purpo&s;e of de&s;troying it.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="034495_0285_0FFE038D638068D0">It is remarkable that gra&s;s thrives better under this tree in a meadow, than in &s;ituations expo&s;ed to the con&s;tant action of the Sun.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on for tapping the trees is in February, March, and April, according to the weather which occurs in the&s;e months.</P>
<P><HI>Warm</HI> days <HI>and fro&s;ty</HI> nights are mo&s;t favourable to a plentiful di&s;charge of &s;ap.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The influence of the weather in increa&s;ing and le&s;&s;ening the di&s;charge of the &s;ap from trees is very remarkable.</P>
<P>Dr. Tongue &s;uppo&s;ed long ago (Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, No. 68) that changes in the weather of every kind might be better a&s;certained by the di&s;charges of &s;ap from trees than by weather gla&s;&s;es. I have &s;een a journal of the effects of heat, cold, moi&s;ture, drought and thunder upon the di&s;charges from the &s;ugar trees, which di&s;po&s;es me to believe that there is &s;ome foundation for Dr. Tongue's opinion&punc;</P></NOTE> The quantity obtain|ed in a day from a tree, is from five gallons to a pint, according to the greater or le&s;s heat of the air. Mr. Low, informed Arthur Noble, E&s;q. that be obtained near three and twenty gallons of &s;ap in one day (April 14, 1789.) from the &s;ingle tree which was before mentioned. Such in&s;tances of a profu&s;ion of &s;ap in &s;ingle trees are however not very common.</P>
<P>There is always a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the di&s;charge of of &s;ap in the night if a fro&s;t &s;ucceed a warm day. The perforation in the tree is made with an axe or an auger. The latter is preferred from experience of its advantages. The auger is introduced about three-quar|ters of an inch, and in an a&s;cending direction (that the
<PB N="280" REF="034495_0286_0FFE039028737418">
&s;ap may not be frozen in a &s;low current in the mor|nings or evenings) and is afterwards deepened gradu|ally to the extent of two inches. A &s;pout is intro|duced about half an inch into the hole, made by this auger, and projects from three to twelve inches from the tree. The &s;pout is generally made of the Sumach <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Rhus.</NOTE> or Elder, <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Sambucus canaden&s;is.</NOTE> which commonly grow in the neigh|bourhood of the &s;ugar trees. The tree is fir&s;t tapped on the <HI>South</HI> &s;ide; when the di&s;charge of its &s;ap begins to le&s;&s;en, an opening is made on its <HI>North</HI> &s;ide, from which an increa&s;ed di&s;charge takes place. The &s;ap flows from four to &s;ix weeks, according to the temperature of the weather. Troughs large enough to contain three or four gallons made of white pine, or white a&s;h, or of dried water a&s;h, a&s;pen, linden, poplar, <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Liriodendron Tulipifera.</NOTE> or common maple, are placed under the &s;pout, to receive the &s;ap, which is carried every day to a large receiver, made of either of the trees before mentioned. From this receiver it is conveyed, after being &s;trained, to the boiler.</P>
<P>To pre&s;erve the &s;ap from rain and impurities of all kinds, it is a good practice to cover the troughs with a concave board, with a hole in the middle of it.</P>
<P>It remains yet to be determined whether &s;ome arti|ficial heat may be applied &s;o as to increa&s;e the quantity
<PB N="281" REF="034495_0287_0FFE0392E7B5EC90">
and improve the quality of the &s;ap. Mr. Noble in|formed me, that he &s;aw a tree, under which a farmer had accidently burnt &s;ome bru&s;h, which dropped a a thick heavy &s;yrup re&s;embling mola&s;&s;es. This fact may probably lead to &s;omething u&s;eful hereafter.</P>
<P>During the remaining part of the &s;pring months, as al&s;o in the Summer, and in the beginning of Au|tumn, the maple tree yields a thin &s;ap, but not fit for the manufactory of &s;ugar. It affords a plea&s;ant drink in harve&s;t, and has been u&s;ed in&s;tead of rum, in &s;ome in&s;tances by tho&s;e farmers in Connecticut, who&s;e ance&s;tors have left to them here, and there, a &s;ugar maple tree, (probably to &s;hade their cattle,) in all their fields. Mr. Bruce de&s;cribes a drink of the &s;ame kind, prepared by the inhabitants of Egypt, by infu&s;ing the &s;ugar cane in water, which he declares to be "the mo&s;t refre&s;hing drink in the world."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Baron La Hontan, gives the following account of the &s;ap of the &s;ugar maple-tree, when u&s;ed as a drink, and of the manner of obtaining it, "The tree yields a &s;ap which has a much plea&s;anter ta&s;te than the be&s;t lemonade or cherry water, and makes the whole&s;ome&s;t drink in the world. This liquor is drawn by cutting the tree two inches deep in the wood, the cut being made &s;loping to the length of ten or twelve inches; at the lower end of this ga&s;h, a knife is thruft into the tree &s;lopingly, &s;o that the water runs along the cut or ga&s;h, as through a gutter and falls upon the knife, which has &s;ome ve&s;&s;els placed underneath to receive it. Some trees will yield five or &s;ix bottles of this water in a day, and &s;ome inhabitants of Canada might draw twenty hog&s;heads of it in one day, if they would thus cut and notch all the maple trees of their re&s;pec|tive plantations. The ga&s;h does no <HI>harm to the tree.</HI> Of this &s;ap they make &s;ugar and &s;yrup which is &s;o valuable that there can be no better remedy for fortifying the &s;tomach. 'Tis but few of the inhabiants that have the patience to make them, for as common things are &s;lighted, &s;o there are &s;carce any body but children that give them&s;elves he trouble of ga&s;hing the&s;e trees."</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="034495_0288_0FFE049352274338">There are three methods of reducing the &s;ap to &s;ugar.</P>
<P N="1">1. By freezing it; this method has been tried for many years, by Mn Obediah Scott, a farmer in Luzerne county in this &s;tate, with great &s;ucce&s;s. He &s;ays that one half of a given quantity of &s;ap re|duced in this way, is better than one-third of the &s;ame quantity reduced by boiling. If the fro&s;t &s;hould not be inten&s;e enough, to reduce the &s;ap to the graining point, it may afterwards be expo&s;ed to the action of the fire for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. By <HI>&s;pontaneos evaporation.</HI> The hollow &s;tump of a maple-&s;ugar tree, which had been cut down in the &s;pring, and which was found &s;ometime after|wards filled with &s;ugar, fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted this method of obtaining &s;ugar to our farmers. So many circum|&s;tances of cold and dry weather, large and flat ve&s;&s;els, and above all &s;o much time are nece&s;&s;ary to obtain &s;ugar, by either of the above methods, that the mo&s;t general method among our farmers is to obtain it,</P>
<P N="3">3. By <HI>boiling.</HI> For this purpo&s;e the following facts which have been a&s;certained by many experiments, de&s;erve attention.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;ooner the &s;ap is boiled, after it is collect|ed from the tree, the better. It &s;hould never be kept
<PB N="283" REF="034495_0289_0FFE039471FF31C0">
longer than twenty four hours, before it is put over the fire.</P>
<P N="2">2. The larger the ve&s;&s;el in which the &s;ap is boiled, the more &s;ugar is obtained from it.</P>
<P N="3">3. A copper ve&s;&s;el affords a &s;ugar of a fairer colour than an iron ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The &s;ap flows into wooden troughs from which it is carried and poured into &s;tone troughs or large ci&s;terns in the &s;hape of a canoe or large manger made of white a&s;h, linden, ba&s;s wood, or white pine, from which it is conveyed to the kettle in which it is to be boiled. The&s;e ci&s;terns, as well as the kettle, are generally covered by a &s;hed to defend the &s;ap from the rain. The &s;ugar is improved by draining the &s;ap through a blanket or cloth, either before or after it is half boiled. Butter, hogs lard, or tallow are added to the &s;ap in the kettle to prevent its boiling over, and lime, eggs or new-milk are mixed with it in order to clarify it. I have &s;een clear &s;ugar made without the addition of either of them. A &s;poonful of &s;lack lime, the white of one egg, and a pint of new-milk are the u&s;ual proportions of the&s;e articles which are mixed with fifteen gallons of &s;ap. In &s;ome &s;amples which I have lately &s;een of maple-&s;ugar clarified with each of the above articles, that, in which milk alone was u&s;ed, had an evident &s;uperiority over the others, in point of colour.</P>
<P>The &s;ugar after being &s;ufficiently boiled, is <HI>grained</HI> and <HI>clayed,</HI> and afterwards <HI>refined,</HI> or converted into
<PB N="284" REF="034495_0290_0FFE0399C2F73B48">
loaf &s;ugar. The methods of conducing each of the&s;e proce&s;&s;es is so nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e which are u&s;ed in the manufactory of We&s;t-India &s;ugar, and are &s;o generally known, that I need not &s;pend any time in de&s;cribing them.</P>
<P>It has been a &s;ubject of enquiry whether the ma|ple &s;ugar might not be improved in its quality and increa&s;ed in its quantity by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of boiling hou&s;es in the &s;ugar maple country to be con|ducted by <HI>a&s;&s;ociated</HI> labor. From the &s;cattered &s;itu|ation of the trees, the difficulty of carrying the &s;ap to a great di&s;tance, and from the many expen&s;es which mu&s;t accrue from &s;upporting labourers and hor&s;es in the woods in a &s;ea&s;on of the year in which nature affords no &s;u&s;tenance to man or bea&s;t, I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe that the mo&s;t productive method both in quantity and profit of obtaining this &s;ugar will be by the labor of private families. For a great number of years many hundred private families in New-York and Penn&s;ylvania have &s;upplied them&s;elves plentifully with this &s;ugar during the whole year. I have heard of many families who have made from two to four hundred pounds in a year; and of one man who &s;old &s;ix hundred pounds, all made with his own hands in one &s;ea&s;on.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The following receipts publi&s;hed by William Cooper, E&s;q. in the Albany Gazette, fully e&s;tabli&s;hes this fact.</HI></P>
<P>"Received, Cooper's Town, April 30th, 1790, of William Cooper, &s;ixteen pounds, for &s;ix hundred and forty pounds of &s;ugar made with <HI>my own hands,</HI> without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in le&s;s than four weeks, be&s;ides attend|ing to the other bu&s;ine&s;s of my farm, as providing fire wood, taking care of the cattle, &amp;c.

<P>A &s;ingle family, con&s;i&s;ting of a man and his two &s;ons, on the maple &s;ugar lands between the Delaware and Su&s;quehannah made 1800lb. of maple &s;ugar in one &s;ea&s;on.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="034495_0291_0FFE039B4B74B958">Not more knowledge is nece&s;&s;ary for making this &s;ugar than is required to make &s;oap, cyder, beer, four-crout, &amp;c. and yet one or all of the&s;e are made in mo&s;t of the farm hou&s;es of the United States. The kettles and other uten&s;ils of a farmer's kitchen, will &s;erve mo&s;t of the purpo&s;es of making &s;ugar, and the time required for the labor, (if it de&s;erves that name) is at a &s;ea&s;on when it is impo&s;&s;ible for the farmer to employ him&s;elf in any &s;pecies of agricul|ture. His wife and all his children above ten years of age, moreover may a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this bu&s;ine&s;s, for the profit of the weake&s;t of them is nearly equal to that of a man, when hired for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>A comparative view of this &s;ugar has been fre|guently made with the &s;ugar which is obtained from the We&s;t India &s;ugar cane, with re&s;pect to its <HI>quality, price,</HI> and the po&s;&s;ible or probable <HI>quantity</HI> that can be made of it in the United States, each of which I &s;hall con&s;ider in order.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>quality</HI> of this &s;ugar is nece&s;&s;arily better than that which is made in the We&s;t-Indies. It is prepared in a &s;ea&s;on when not a &s;ingle in&s;ect exi&s;ts to feed upon it, or to mix its excretions with it, and
<PB N="286" REF="034495_0292_0FFE039CD340D158">
before a particle of du&s;t or of the pollen of plants can float in the air. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation cannot be applied to the We&s;t-India &s;ugar. The in&s;ects and worms which prey upon it, and of cour&s;e mix with it, compo&s;e a page in a nomenclature of natural hi&s;tory. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the hands which are employed in making &s;ugar in the We&s;t-Indies but, that men who work for the exclu&s;ive benefit of others, are not under the &s;ame obligations to keep their per&s;ons clean while they are employed in this work, that men women and children are, who work exclu&s;ively for the benefit of <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> and who have been educated in the habits of cleanline&s;s. The &s;uperior purity of the maple &s;ugar is farther proved by its leaving a le&s;s &s;ediment when di&s;&s;olved in water, than the We&s;t-India &s;ugar.</P>
<P>It has been &s;uppo&s;ed that the maple &s;ugar is inferi|or to the We&s;t-India &s;ugar in <HI>&s;trength.</HI> The experi|ments which led to this opinion, I &s;u&s;pect have been in|accurate, or have been made with maple &s;ugar, pre|pared in a &s;lovenly manner. I have examined equal quantities, by weight, of both the grained and the loaf &s;ugar, in hy&s;on tea, and in coffee, made in eve|ry re&s;pect equal by the minute&s;t circum&s;tances that could affect the quality or ta&s;te of each of them, and could perceive no inferiority in the &s;trength of the maple &s;ugar. The liquors which decided this que&s;|tion were examined at the &s;ame time, by Alexander Hamilton, E&s;q. Secretary of the Trea&s;ury of the
<PB N="287" REF="034495_0293_0FFE039F9553E660">
United States, Mr. Henry Drinker, and &s;everal Ladies, who all concurred in the above opinion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whoever con&s;iders that the gift of the &s;ugar maple trees is from a benevolent Providence, that we have many millions of acres in our country co|vered with them, that the tree is improved by repeat|ed tappings, and that the &s;ugar is obtained by the fru|gal labor of a farmer's family, and at the &s;ame time con&s;iders the labor of cultivating the &s;ugar cane, the the capitals &s;unk in &s;ugar works, the fir&s;t co&s;t of &s;laves and cattle, the expen&s;es of provi&s;ions for both of them, and in &s;ome in&s;tances the additional ex|pen&s;e of conveying the &s;ugar to a market, in all the We&s;t-India I&s;lands, will not he&s;itate in believing that the maple &s;ugar may be manufactured much cheaper, and &s;old at a <HI>le&s;s price</HI> than that which is made in the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P N="3">3. The re&s;ources for making a &s;ufficient <HI>quantity</HI> of this &s;ugar not only for the con&s;umption of the United States, but for exportation, will appear from the following facts. There are in the &s;tates of New-York, and Penn&s;ylvania alone at lea&s;t ten milli|ons of acres of land which produce the &s;ugar maple-tree, in the proportion of thirty trees to one acre. Now, &s;uppo&s;ing all the per&s;ons capable of labor in a family to con&s;i&s;t of three, and each per&s;on to attend 150 trees and each tree to yield 5lbs. of &s;ugar in a &s;ea&s;on, the product of the labor of 60,000 families
<PB N="288" REF="034495_0294_0FFE03A4CA60E410">
would be 135,000,000 pounds of &s;ugar, and allowing the inhabitants of the United States to compo&s;e 600,000 families, each of which con&s;umed 200 pounds of &s;ugar in a year, the whole con&s;umption would be 120,000,000 pounds in a year, which would leave a balance of 15,000,000 pounds for exportation. Va|luing the &s;ugar at 6-90 of a dollar per pound, the &s;um &s;aved to the United States would be 8,000,000 dollars by home con&s;umption, and the &s;um gained by exportation would be 1,000,000 dollars. The only part of this calculation that will appear improbable is, the number of families &s;uppo&s;ed to be employed in the manufactory of the &s;ugar, but the difficulty of admitting this &s;uppo&s;ition will vani&s;h when we con&s;i|der, that double that number of families are employed every year, in making cyder, the trouble, ri&s;ks and expen&s;es of which are all much greater than tho&s;e of making maple-&s;ugar.</P>
<P>But the profit of the maple tree is not confined to its &s;ugar. It affords a mo&s;t agreeable mola&s;&s;es, and an excellent vinegar. The &s;ap which is &s;uitable for the&s;e purpo&s;es is obtained after the &s;ap which affords the &s;ugar has cea&s;ed to flow, &s;o that the manufacto|ries of the&s;e different products of the maple tree, by <HI>&s;ucceeding,</HI> do not interfere with each other. The mola&s;&s;es may be made to compo&s;e the ba&s;is of a plea|&s;ant &s;ummer beer. The &s;ap of the maple is more|over capable of affording a &s;pirit, but we hope this precious juice will never be pro&s;titued by our citi|zens
<PB N="289" REF="034495_0295_0FFE03A6537E0938">
to this ignoble purpo&s;e. Should the u&s;e of &s;ugar in diet become more general in our country, it may tend to le&s;&s;en the inclinition or &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity for &s;pirits, for I have ob&s;erved a reli&s;h for &s;ugar in diet to be &s;eldom accompanied by a love for &s;trong drink. It is the &s;ugar which is mixed with tea which makes it &s;o generally di&s;agreeable to drunkards. But a diet, con&s;i&s;ting of a plentiful mixture of &s;ugar has other advantages to recommend it, which I &s;hall briefly enu|merate.</P>
<P N="1">1. Sugar affords the greate&s;t quantity of nouri&s;h|ment in a given quantity of matter of any &s;ub&s;tance in nature; of cour&s;e it may be pre&s;erved in le&s;s room in our hou&s;es, and may be con&s;umed in le&s;s time, than more bulky and le&s;s nouri&s;hing aliment. It has this peculiar advantage over mo&s;t kinds of aliment, that it is not liable to have its nutritious qualities affected by time or the weather, hence it is preferred by the Indians in their excur&s;ions from home. They mix a certain quantity of Maple &s;ugar, with an equal quantity of Indian corn, dried and powdered, in its milky &s;tate. This mixture is packed in little ba&s;kets, which are frequently wetted in travelling, without injuring the &s;ugar. A few &s;poons full of it mixed with half a pint of &s;pring water, afford them a plea|&s;ant and &s;trengthening meal. From the degrees of &s;trength and nouri&s;hment, which are conveyed into animal bodies by a &s;mall bulk of &s;ugar, I conceive it might be given to hor&s;es with great advantage, when
<PB N="290" REF="034495_0296_0FFE03A804766908">
they are u&s;ed in circum&s;tances which make it difficult or expen&s;ive to &s;upport them, with more bulky or weighty aliment. A pound of &s;ugar with gra&s;s or hay, I have been told, has &s;upported the &s;trength and &s;pirits of an hor&s;e, during a whole day's labour in one of the We&s;t-India I&s;lands. A larger quantity given alone, has fattened hor&s;es and cattle during the war before la&s;t in Hi&s;paniola, for a period of &s;everal months, in which the exportation of &s;ugar, and the importation of grain, were prevented by the want of &s;hips.</P>
<P N="2">2. The plentiful u&s;e of &s;ugar in diet, is one of the be&s;t preventives that has ever been di&s;covered of the di&s;ea&s;es which are produced by worms. The Author of Nature &s;eems to have implanted a love for this ali|ment in all children, as if it were on purpo&s;e to defend them from tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. I know a gentleman in Philadelphia, who early adopted this opinion, and who by indulging a large family of children, in the u&s;e of &s;ugar, has pre&s;erved them all from the di&s;ea&s;es u&s;ually occa&s;ioned by worms.</P>
<P N="3">3. Sir John Pringle has remarked, that the plague has never been known in any country where &s;ugar compo&s;es a material part of the diet of the inhabitants. I think it probable, that the frequency of malignant fevers of all kinds has been le&s;&s;ened by this diet, and that its more general u&s;e would defend that cla&s;s of people, who are mo&s;t &s;ubject to malignant fevers, from being &s;o often affected by them.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="291" REF="034495_0297_0FFE03AAC7788190">4. In the numerous and frequent di&s;orders of the brea&s;t, which occur in all countries, where the body is expo&s;ed to a variable temperature of weather, &s;ugar affords the ba&s;is of many agreeable remedies. It is u&s;eful in weakne&s;&s;es, and acrid defluxions upon other parts of the body. Many facts might be adduced in favor of this a&s;&s;ertion. I &s;hall mention only one, which from the venerable name of the per&s;on, who&s;e ca&s;e furni&s;hed it, cannot fail of commanding atten|tion and credit. Upon my enquiring of Dr. Frank|lin, at the reque&s;t of a friend, about a year before he died, whether he had found any relief from the pain of the &s;tone, from the Blackberry Jam, of which he took large quantities, he told me that he had, but that he believed the medicinal part of the jam, re&s;ided wholly in the &s;ugar, and as a rea&s;on for think|ing &s;o, he added, that he often found the &s;ame relief, by taking about half a pint of a &s;yrup, prepared by boiling a little brown &s;ugar in water, ju&s;t before he went to bed, that he did from a do&s;e of opium. It has been &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome of the early phy&s;icians of our country, that the &s;ugar obtained from the maple tree, is more medicinal, that that obtained from the We&s;t-India &s;ugar cane, but this opinion I believe is without foundation. It is preferable in its qualities to the We&s;t-India &s;ugar only from its &s;uperior <HI>cleanli|ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Ca&s;es may occur in which &s;ugar may be required in medicine, or in diet, by per&s;ons who refu&s;e to be
<PB N="292" REF="034495_0298_0FFE03AECD1C23E0">
benefited, even indirectly by the labour of &s;laves. In &s;uch ca&s;es, the innocent maple &s;ugar will always be pre|ferred<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Knowles, a phy&s;ician of worthy character in London, had occa&s;ion to recommend a diet to a patient, of which &s;ugar compo&s;ed a material part. His patient refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to his pre&s;cription, and give as a rea&s;on for it, that he had witne&s;&s;ed &s;o much of the expre&s;&s;ion and exactly which were exerci&s;es upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, who <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ugar, that he had made a vow never to ta&s;te the reduct of their mi&s;ery as long as he lived.</NOTE></P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that &s;ugar injures the teeth, but this opinion now has &s;o few advocates, that it does not de&s;erve a &s;erious refutation.</P>
<P>To tran&s;mit to future generations, all the advan|tages which have been enumerated from the maple tree, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to protect it by law, or by a bounty upon the maple &s;ugar, from being de&s;troyed by the &s;ettlers in the maple country, or to tran&s;plant it from the woods, and cultivate it in the old and improved parts of the United States. An orchard con&s;i&s;ting of 200 trees, planted upon a common farm would yield more than the &s;ame number of apple trees, at a di&s;tance from a market town. A full grown tree in the woods yields five pounds of &s;ugar a year. If a greater expo&s;ure of a tree to the action of the &s;un, has the &s;ame effects upon the maple, that it has upon other trees, a larger quantity of &s;ugar might rea&s;onably be expected from each tree planted in an orchard. Allowing it to be only &s;even pounds, then 200 trees will yield 1400 pounds of &s;ugar, and deducting 200 from the quantity, for the con&s;umption of the family,
<PB N="293" REF="034495_0299_0FFE03B190CFE4E0">
there will remain for &s;ale 1200 pounds which at 6-90 of a dollar per pound will yield an annual profit to the farmer of 80 dollars. But if it &s;hould be found that the &s;hade of the maple does not check the growth of grain any more than it does of gra&s;s, double or treble that number of maple trees may be plant|ed on every farm, and a profit proportioned to the above calculation be derived from them. Should this mode of tran&s;planting the means of obtaining &s;ugar be &s;ucce&s;sful, it Will not be a new one. The &s;ugar cane of the We&s;t-Indies, was brought originally from the Ea&s;t-Indies, by the Portugue&s;e, and cultivated at Madeira, from whence it was tran&s;planted directly or indirectly, to all the &s;ugar I&s;lands of the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed, that the &s;ettlers upon the &s;u|gar maple lands, would &s;pare the &s;ugar tree in clearing their lands, On a farm of 200 acres of land, accor|ding to our former calculation, there are u&s;ually 6,000 maple trees. If only 2,000 of tho&s;e original and ancient inhabitants of the woods, were &s;uffered to remain, and each tree were to afford only five pounds of &s;ugar, the annual profit of &s;uch a farm in &s;ugar alone, at the price formerly mentioned, would amount to 666 dollars, 150 dollars of which would probably more than defray all the expen&s;es of making it, and allow a plentiful deduction for family u&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>ALL ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE AND DEATH OF EDWARD DRINKER, WHO DIED ON THE 17TH OF NOVEMBER, 1782, IN THE 103 YEAR OF HIS AGE.</HEAD>
<P>EDWARD DRINKER was born on the 24th of December, 1680, in a &s;mall cab|bin, near the pre&s;ent corner of Walnut and Second-&s;treets, in the city of Philadelphia. His parents came from a place called Beverly, in the &s;tate Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. The banks of the Delaware, on which the city of Philadelphia now &s;tands, were inhabited, at the time of his birth, by Indians, and a few Swedes and Hol|landers. He often talked to his companions of pick|ing whortle berries and catching rabbits, on &s;pots now the mo&s;t improved and populous in the city. He recollected the &s;econd time William Penn came to Penn&s;ylvania, and u&s;ed to point to the place where the cabbin &s;tood, in which he, and his friends, that accompanied him, were accommodated upon their arri|val. At twelve years of age, he went to Bo&s;ton, where he &s;erved his apprentice&s;hip to a cabinet maker. In the year 1745, he returned to Philadelphia, with his family, where he lived until the time of his death. He was four times married, and had eighteen children, all of whom were by his fir&s;t wife. At one time of his life, he &s;at down, at his own table, with fourteen children. Not long before his death he heard of the
<PB N="296" REF="034495_0302_0FFE03BB5008C450">
birth of a grand-child, to one of his grand-children, the fifth in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He retained all his faculties till the la&s;t year of his life. Even his memory, &s;o early and &s;o generally dimini|&s;hed by age was but little impaired. He not only remembered the incidents of his childhood and youth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable that the incidents of childhood and youth are &s;el|dom remembered or called forth until old age. I have &s;ometimes been led, from this and other circum&s;tances, to &s;u&s;pect that nothing is ever lo&s;t that is lodged in the memory, however it may be buried for a time by a variety of cau&s;es. How often do we find the tran&s;actions of early life, which we had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e were lo&s;t from the mind for ever, revived in our memories by certain accidental &s;ights or &s;ounds, particularly by certain notes or airs in mu&s;ics. I have known a young man &s;peak French fluently when drunk, that could not put two &s;entences of that language together, when &s;ober. He had been taught it perfectly, when a boy, but had forgotten it from difu&s;e. A French counte&s;s was nur&s;ed by a Wel&s;h woman, from whom &s;he learned to &s;peak her language, which &s;he &s;oon forgot, after &s;he had acquired the French, which was her mother tongue. In the delirium of a fever, many years afterwards, &s;he was heard to matter words which none of her family or attendants under|&s;tood. An old Wel&s;h woman came to &s;ee her, who &s;oon perceived that the &s;ounds which were &s;o unintelligible to the family, were the Wel&s;h lan|guage. When &s;he recovered, &s;he could not recollect a &s;ingle word of the language, &s;he had &s;poken in her &s;ickne&s;s. I can conceive great advantages may be derived from this retentive power in our memories, in the advancement of the mind towards perfection in knowledge (&s;o e&s;&s;ential to its happine&s;s) in a future world.</NOTE>, but the events of latter years; and &s;o faithful was his memory to him, that his &s;on has informed me he ne|ver heard him tell the &s;ame &s;tory twice, but to different per&s;ons, and in different companies. His eye-&s;ight
<PB N="297" REF="034495_0303_0FFE03BCDA01E5E0">
failed him, many years before his death, but his hearing was uniformly perfect and unimpaired. His appetite was good till within a few days before his death. He generally ate a hearty breakfa&s;t of a pint of tea or coffee, as &s;oon as he got out of his bed, with bread and butter in proportion. He ate likewi&s;e at eleven o'clock, and never failed to eat plentifully at dinner of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;olid food. He drank tea, in the even|ing, but never ate any &s;upper: he had lo&s;t all his teeth thirty years before his death, which was occa&s;ioned, his &s;on &s;ays, by drawing exce&s;&s;ive hot &s;moke of tobacco into his mouth: but the want of &s;uitable ma&s;tication of his food, did not prevent its &s;peedy dige&s;tion, nor impair his health. Whether the gums, hardened by age, &s;upplied the place of his teeth in a certain degree, or whether the juices of the mouth and &s;tomach be|came &s;o much more acrid by time, as to perform the office of di&s;&s;olving the food more &s;peedily and more perfectly, I know not, but I have often ob&s;erved, that old people are mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to exce&s;&s;ive eating, and that they &s;uffer fewe&s;t inconveniences from it. He was inqui&s;itive after news in the la&s;t years of his life. His education did not lead him to increa&s;e the &s;tock of his ideas any other way. But it is a fact well worth attending to, that old age, in&s;tead of dimini&s;h|ing, always increa&s;es the de&s;ire of knowledge. It mu&s;t afford &s;ome con&s;olation to tho&s;e who expect to be old, to di&s;cover, that the infirmities to which the decays of nature expo&s;e the human body, are rendered more
<PB N="298" REF="034495_0304_0FFE03BE613C58B8">
tolerable by the enjoyments that are to be derived from the appetite for &s;en&s;ual and intellectual food.</P>
<P>He was remarkably &s;ober and temperate. Neither hard labour, nor company, nor the u&s;ual afflictions of human life, nor the wa&s;tes of nature, ever led him to an improper or exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;trong drink. For the la&s;t twenty-five years of his life, he drank twice every day of toddy, made with two table &s;poonfuls of &s;pirit, in half a pint of water. His &s;on, a man of fifty-nine years of age, told me that he had never &s;een him intoxicated. The time and manner in which he u&s;ed &s;pirituous liquors, I believe, contri|buted to lighten the weight of his years, and proba|bly to prolong his life.
<Q>Give wine to him that is of a heavy heart, and &s;trong drink to him that is ready to peri&s;h with age, as well as with &s;ickne&s;s. Let him drink and forget his &s;orrow, and remember his mi&s;ery no more.</Q></P>
<P>He enjoyed an uncommon &s;hare of health, in&s;omuch that in the cour&s;e of his long life he never was confined more than three days to his bed. He often declared that he had no idea of that mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing pain called the head ache. His &s;leep was interrupted a little in the la&s;t years of his life with a defluxion on his brea&s;t, which produced what is commonly called the old man's cough.</P>
<P>The character of this aged citizen was not &s;ummed up in his negative quality of temperance: he was a
<PB N="299" REF="034495_0305_0FFE03BFE9F881C0">
man of the mo&s;t amiable temper: old age had not curdled his blood; he was uniformly chearful and kind to every body; his religious principles were as &s;teady as his morals were pure. He attended public wor&s;hip about thirty years in the Rev. Dr. Sproat's church, and died in a full a&s;&s;urance of a happy immortality. The life of this man is marked with &s;everal circum|&s;tances, which perhaps have &s;eldom occured in the life of an individual events. He &s;aw and heard more of tho&s;e events which are mea&s;ured by time, than have ever been &s;een or heard by any mane &s;ince the age of the patriarchs; he &s;aw the &s;ame &s;pot of earth, which at one period of his life, was covered with wood and bu&s;hes, and the receptacle of bea&s;ts and birds of prey, afterwards become the &s;eat of a city not only the fir&s;t in wealth and arts in the new, but rivalling in both, many of the fir&s;t cities in the old world. He &s;aw regular &s;treets where he once pur&s;ued a hare: he &s;aw churches ri&s;ing upon mora&s;&s;es, where he had often heard the croaking of frogs; he &s;aw wharfs and warehou&s;es, where he had often &s;een Indian &s;avages draw fi&s;h from the river for their daily &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and he &s;aw &s;hips of every &s;ize and u&s;e in tho&s;e &s;treams, where he had often &s;een nothing but Indian canoes; he &s;aw a &s;tately edifice filled with legi&s;lators, a&s;toni&s;h|ing the world with their wi&s;dom and virtue, on the &s;ame &s;pot, probably, where he had &s;een an Indian council fire; he &s;aw the fir&s;t treaty ratified between the newly confederated powers of America and the

<HEAD>REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE CONSTITUTION AND LIFE OF ANN WOODS, AN OLD WOMAN OF 96 YEARS OF AGE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the &s;ummer of the year 1788, while I was engaged in collecting the facts upon the &s;ubject of old age, which I have &s;ince publi&s;hed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Inquiries and Ob&s;ervations. vol. 2.</NOTE> a poor woman came to my hou&s;e to beg for cold vic|tuals. Perceiving by her countenance, and the &s;toop in her walk, that &s;he was very old, I reque&s;ted her to &s;it down by me, while I recorded the following information, which I received from her, and which was confirmed to me a few days afterwards, by one of her daughters with whom &s;he lived. Her name was Ann Woods. Her age at that time was 96. She was born in Hereford&s;hire, in England, and came to this city when &s;he was but ten years old, where &s;he had lived ever &s;ince. She had been twice married. By her fir&s;t hu&s;band Wm. Dick&s;on, &s;he had nine chil|dren, four of whom were then living. By her &s;econd hu&s;band Jo&s;eph Woods, whom &s;he married after &s;he was &s;ixty years old, &s;he had one child, born within ten months after her marriage. There were inter|vals of two and nearly three years between each of her children. Three died &s;oon after weaning them at the u&s;ual age in which children are taken from
<PB N="302" REF="034495_0308_0FFE03CAAC16C228">
the brea&s;t. This led her to &s;uckle her other children during the whole time of her pregnancy, and in &s;everal in&s;tances, &s;he &s;uckled two of them, born in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to each other, at the &s;ame time. One of her children by her fir&s;t hu&s;band, &s;ucked until it was five years old. Her men&s;es appeared between her nineteenth and twentieth years and continued with|out any intermi&s;&s;ion, except during her pregnancy and eleven months after the birth of each of her children, until &s;he was eighty years of age. At the time I &s;aw her, &s;he heard tolerably well, but her &s;ight was lo&s;t in one eye, and was weak in the other. She lo&s;t all her teeth when &s;he was between fifty and &s;ixty years of age. Her hair became grey when &s;he was between forty and fifty. Her &s;leep was not &s;ound, owing to her having been afflicted with the Rheuma|ti&s;m, a di&s;ea&s;e which was brought on her by the alternate heat and cold to winch &s;he had expo&s;ed her&s;elf, by following the bu&s;ine&s;s of a wa&s;her woman for many years. She had had &s;everal attacks of the intermitting fever, and of the Pleuri&s;y in the cour&s;e of her life, and was much afflicted with the Head-ache after her men&s;es cea&s;ed. She had been frequently bled while afflicted with the above di&s;ea&s;es. Her diet was &s;imple, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of weak tea, milk, chee&s;e, butter and vegetables. Meat of all kinds, except veal, di&s;agreed with her &s;tomach. She found great benefit from frequently changing her aliment. Her drinks were water, cyder and water, mola&s;&s;es and vinegar in
<PB N="303" REF="034495_0309_0FFE03CC532634D8">
water. She hid never u&s;ed &s;pirits. Her memory was but little impaired. She was cheerful and thank|ful that her condition in life was happier than hund|reds of other old people.</P>
<P>From the hi&s;tory of this old woman's con&s;titution and manner of life, the following ob&s;ervations will naturally occur to the reader.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is a great latitude in the time in which the men&s;es cea&s;e. It is more common for them in their excentricities, to di&s;appear at the u&s;ual time, and to return in extreme old age. In the year 1795, I &s;aw a ca&s;e of this kind in a woman of &s;even|ty years of age in the Penn&s;ylvania ho&s;pital.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a great latitude in the time in which women bear children. Many children are born be|tween fifty and &s;ixty, but very few I believe beyond &s;ixty.</P>
<P N="3">3. It appears from the hi&s;tory that has been given, that acute and chronic di&s;ea&s;es if oppo&s;ed by tempe|rance and &s;uitable remedies, do not nece&s;&s;arily &s;horten the duration of human life.</P>
<P N="4">4. That child-bearing, and &s;uckling children, do not materially affect health, or longevity, where their effects are oppo&s;ed by temperance and moderate labor.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the evils of life are &s;eldom &s;o numerous, as not to leave room for thankfulne&s;s for an exemption

from a great deal of mi&s;ery. This poor woman did not complain of her weakne&s;s, pains or poverty. On the contrary, &s;he appeared thankful under all the afflictions of her life.

<HEAD>BIOGRAPHICAL ANECDOTES OF BENJAMAIN LAY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was a time when the name of this celebrated Chri&s;tian Philo&s;opher, was fami|liar to every man, woman and to nearly every child, in Penn&s;ylvania.&mdash;His &s;ize, which was not much above four feet, his dre&s;s, which was always the &s;ame, con&s;i&s;ting of light-coloured plain clothes, a white hat, and half-boots;&mdash;his milk white beard, which hung upon his brea&s;t; and, above all, his peculiar princi|ples and conduct, rendered him to many, an object of admiration, and to all, the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation.&mdash;</P>
<P>He was born in England, and &s;pent the early part of his life at &s;ea. His fir&s;t &s;ettlement was in Barbadoes, as a merchant, where he was &s;oon con|vinced of the iniquity of the &s;lave trade. He bore an open te&s;timony again&s;t it, in all companies, by which means he rendered him&s;elf &s;o unpopular, that he left the i&s;land in di&s;gu&s;t, and &s;ettled in the then province of Penn&s;ylvania. He fixed his home at Abington, ten miles from Philadelphia, from whence he made frequent excur&s;ions to the city, and to different parts of the country.&mdash;</P>
<P>At the time of his arrival in Penn&s;ylvania, he found many of his brethren, the people called Quakers, had fallen &s;o far from their original principles, as to
<PB N="306" REF="034495_0312_0FFE03D60A7EA928">
keep negro &s;laves. He remon&s;trated with them, both publickly and privately, again&s;t the practice; but, frequently with &s;o much indi&s;creet zeal, as to give great offence. He often di&s;turbed their public meet|ings, by interrupting or oppo&s;ing their preachers, for which he was once carried out of a meeting-hou&s;e, by two or three friends.&mdash;Upon this occa&s;ion he &s;ubmit|ted with patience to what he con&s;idered a &s;pecies of per&s;ecution.&mdash;He lay down at the door of the meeting-hou&s;e, in a &s;hower of rain, till divine wor&s;hip was ended; nor could he be prevailed upon to ri&s;e, till the whole congregation had &s;tepped over him in their way to their re&s;pective homes.&mdash;</P>
<P>To &s;hew his indignation again&s;t the practice of &s;lave-keeping, he once carried a bladder filled with blood into a meeting; and, in the pre&s;ence of the whole congregation, thru&s;t a &s;word, which he had con|cealed under his coat, into the bladder, exclaiming, at the &s;ame time,
<Q>Thus &s;hall God &s;hed the blood of tho&s;e per&s;ons who en&s;lave their fellow crea|tures.</Q>
The terror of this extravagant and unex|pected act, produced &s;woonings in &s;everal of the women of the congregation.&mdash;</P>
<P>He once went into the hou&s;e of a friend in Phila|delphia, and found him &s;eated at breakfa&s;t, with his family around him. Being a&s;ked by him to &s;it down and breakfa&s;t with them, he &s;aid,
<Q>Do&s;t thou keep &s;laves in thy hou&s;e?</Q>
Upon being an&s;wered in the
<PB N="307" REF="034495_0313_0FFE03D8CFCA01E8">
affirmative, he &s;aid,
<Q>Then I will not partake with thee, of the fruits of thy unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>He took great pains to convince a farmer and his wife, in Che&s;ter county, of the iniquity of keeping negro &s;laves, but to no purpo&s;e. They not only kept their &s;laves, but defended the practice. One day he went into their hou&s;e, and after a &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e with them upon the wickedne&s;s, and particularly the inhumanity of &s;eparating children from their parents, which was involved in the &s;lave trade, he &s;eized the only child of the family, (a little girl about th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> years old) and pretended to run away with her&mdash;The child cried bitterly, "I will be good,&mdash;I will be good," and the parents &s;hewed &s;igns of being alarmed. Upon ob&s;erving this &s;cene, Mr. Lay &s;aid, very em|phatically,&mdash;
<Q>You <HI>&s;ee,</HI> and <HI>feel</HI> now a little of the di&s;tre&s;s you occa&s;ion every day, by the inhuman practice of &s;lave-keeping.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;ingular philo&s;opher did not limit his pious te&s;timony again&s;t vice, to &s;lave-keeping alone. He was oppo&s;ed to every &s;pecies of extravagance. Upon the introduction of tea, as an article of diet, into Penn&s;ylvania, his wife bought a &s;mall quantity of it, with a &s;ett of cups and &s;aucers, and brought them home with her. Mr. Lay took them from her, brought them back again to the city, and from the balcony of the court-hou&s;e &s;cattered the tea, and broke the cups and &s;aucers, in the pre&s;ence of many hundred &s;pecta|tors, delivering, at the &s;ame time, a &s;triking lecture
<PB N="308" REF="034495_0314_0FFE03DB9CF34910">
upon the folly of preferring that foreign herb, with its expen&s;ive appurtenances, to the &s;imple and whole|&s;ome diet of our country.</P>
<P>He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a good deal of wit, and was quick at rapartee. A citizen of Philadelphia, who knew his peculiarities, once met him in a croud, at a funeral, in Germantown. Being de&s;irous of entering into a conver&s;ation with him that &s;hould divert the company, the citizen acco&s;ted him, with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful ceremony, and declared him&s;elf to be "his mo&s;t humble &s;ervant." "Art thou my &s;ervant." &s;aid Mr. Lay,&mdash;"Yes&mdash;I am" &s;aid the citizen. "Then, &s;aid Mr. Lay, (holding up his foot towards him,) clean this &s;hoe".&mdash;This unexpected reply turned the laugh upon the citizen. Being de&s;irous of recovering him|&s;elf in the opinion of the company, he a&s;ked him to in&s;truct him in the way to heaven.
<Q>Do&s;t thou in|deed wi&s;h to be taught,</Q>
&s;aid Mr. Lay. "I do," &s;aid the citizen. "Then," &s;aid Mr. Lay,
<Q>Do ju&s;tice &mdash;love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God.</Q></P>
<P>He wrote a &s;mall treati&s;e upon negro-&s;lavery, which he brought to Dr. Franklin to be printed. Upon look|ing over it, the Doctor told him that it was not paged, and that there appeared to be no order or arrange|ment in it.
<Q>It is no matter &s;aid Mr. Lay&mdash;print any part thou plea&s;e&s;t fir&s;t.</Q>
&mdash;This book contained many pious &s;entiments, and &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t negro-&s;lavery; but even the addre&s;s and &s;kill of Dr.
<PB N="309" REF="034495_0315_0FFE03DE5F890750">
Franklin were not &s;ufficient to connect its different parts together, &s;o as to render it an agreeable or u&s;e|ful work. This book is in the library of the city of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Mr. Lay was extremely attentive to young people. He took great plea&s;ure in vi&s;iting &s;chools, where he often preached to the youth. He frequently carried a ba&s;ket of religious books with him, and di&s;tributed them as prizes, among the &s;cholars.</P>
<P>He was fond of reading. In the print of him, which is to be &s;een in many hou&s;es in Philadelphia, he is repre&s;ented with "Tryon on happine&s;s" in his hand, a book which he valued very much, and which he frequently carried with him, in his excur&s;ions from home.</P>
<P>He was kind and charitable to the poor, but had no compa&s;&s;ion for beggars. He u&s;ed to &s;ay,
<Q>there was no man or woman, who was able to go abroad to beg, that was not able to earn <HI>four pence</HI> a day, and this &s;um, he &s;aid, was enough to keep any per&s;on above want, or dependence, in this country.</Q></P>
<P>He was a &s;evere enemy to idlene&s;s, in&s;omuch that when he could not employ him&s;elf out of doors, or when he was tired of reading, he u&s;ed to &s;pend his time in &s;pinning. His common &s;itting room was hung with &s;kains of thread, &s;pun entirely by him&s;elf. All his clothes were of his own manufactory.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="034495_0316_0FFE03E121EBA7A0">He was extremely temperate in his diet, living chiefly upon vegetables.&mdash;Turnips boiled, and after|wards roa&s;ted, were his favourite dinner. His drink was pure water. From a de&s;ire of imitating our Sa|viour, in every thing, he once attempted to fa&s;t for forty days. This experiment, it is &s;aid, had nearly co&s;t him his life. He was obliged to de&s;i&s;t from it, long before the forty days were expired; but the fa&s;ting, it was &s;aid, &s;o much debilitated his body, as to accelerate his death.

<HEAD>BIOGRAPHICAL ANECDOTES OF ANTHONY BENEZET.</HEAD>
<P>THIS excellent man was placed by his friends in early life in a counting hou&s;e, but finding commerce opened temptations to a world|ly &s;pirit, he left his ma&s;ter, and bound him&s;elf as an apprentice to a cooper. Finding this bu&s;ine&s;s too laborious for his con&s;titution, he declined it, and de|voted him&s;elf to &s;chool-keeping; in which u&s;eful em|ployment, he continued during the greate&s;t part of his life.</P>
<P>He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed uncommon activity and indu&s;try in eve|ry thing he undertook. He did every thing as if the

words of his Saviour were perpetually &s;ounding in his ears,
<Q>wi&s;t ye not, that I mu&s;t be about my Father's bu&s;ine&s;s?</Q></P>
<P>He u&s;ed to &s;ay, "the highe&s;t act of charity in the world was to bear with the <HI>unrea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of man|kind."</P>
<P>He generally wore plu&s;h clothes, and gave as a rea&s;on for it, that after he had worn them for two or three years, they made comfortable and decent gar|ments for the poor.</P>
<P>He once informed a young friend, that his memory began to fail him; "but this," &s;aid he,
<Q>gives me one great advantage over thee&mdash;for thou can&s;t find entertainment in reading a good book only <HI>once</HI>&mdash;but I enjoy that plea&s;ure as often as I read it; for it is always new to me.</Q></P>
<P>He publi&s;hed &s;everal valuable tracts in favor of the emancipation of the blacks, and of the civilizing and chri&s;tianizing the Indians. He al&s;o publi&s;hed a pamphlet again&s;t the u&s;e of ardent &s;pirits. All the&s;e publica|tions were circulated with great indu&s;try, and at his own expen&s;e, throughout every part of the United States.</P>
<P>He wrote letters to the queen of Great-Britain, and to the queen of Portugal to u&s;e their influence with their re&s;pective courts to aboli&s;h the African trade. He accompanied his letter to the queen of Great-Bri|tain
<PB N="313" REF="034495_0319_0FFE03E996D2F0F8">
with a pre&s;ent of his works. The queen received them with great politene&s;s, and &s;aid after reading them "that the author appeared to be a very good man."</P>
<P>He al&s;o wrote a letter to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, in which he endeavoured to convince him of the un|lawfulne&s;s of war.</P>
<P>During the time the Briti&s;h army was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city of Philadelphia, he was indefatigable in his endeavours to render the &s;ituation of the per&s;ons who &s;uffered from captivity as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible. He knew no fear in the pre&s;ence of his fellow men, however dig|nified they were by titles or &s;tation, and &s;uch were the propriety and gentlene&s;s of his manners in his intercour&s;e with the gentlemen who commanded the Briti&s;h and German troops, that when he could not obtain the objects of his reque&s;ts, he never failed to &s;e|cure their civilities, and frequently their e&s;teem.</P>
<P>So great was his &s;ympathy with every thing that was capable of feeling pain, that he re&s;olved towards the clo&s;e of his life, to eat no animal food. Upon com|ing into his brother's hou&s;e one day, when his family was dining upon poultry, he was a&s;ked by his brother's wife, to &s;it down and dine with them. "What!

<P>This mi&s;application of a moral feeling, was &s;up|po&s;ed to have brought on &s;uch a debility in his &s;tomach and bowels, as produced a di&s;ea&s;e in tho&s;e parts of which he finally died.</P>

<HEAD>PARADISE OF NEGRO-SLAVES.&mdash;A DREAM.</HEAD>
<P>SOON after reading Mr. Clark&s;on's ingeni|ous and pathetic e&s;&s;ay on the &s;lavery and commerce of the human &s;pecies, the &s;ubject made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion upon my mind, that it follow|ed me in my &s;leep, and produced a dream of &s;o ex|traordinary a nature, that I have yielded to the im|portunities of &s;ome of my friends, by communicating it to the public. I thought I was conducted to a country, which in point of cultivation and &s;cenery, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed any thing I had ever heard, or read of in my life. This country, I found, was inhabited only by negroes. They appeared cheerful and happy. Upon my approaching a beautiful grove, where a number of them were a&s;&s;embled for religious purpo&s;es, I perceived at once a pau&s;e in their exerci&s;es, and an appearance of general perturbation. They fixed their eyes upon me&mdash;while one of them, a venerable look|ing man, came forward, and in the name of the whole a&s;&s;embly, addre&s;&s;ed me in the following language.</P>
<P><Q>Excu&s;e the panic which you have &s;pread through this peaceful and happy company: we perceive that you are a <HI>white man.</HI>&mdash;That colour which is the emblem of innocence in every other creature of God, is to us a &s;ign of guilt in man. The per&s;ons whom you &s;ee here, were once dragged by the men of your colour from their native country, and con|&s;igned

by them to labour&mdash;puni&s;hment&mdash;and death. &mdash;We are here collected together, and enjoy an ample compen&s;ation in our pre&s;ent employments for all the mi&s;eries we endured on earth. We know that we are &s;ecured by the Being whom we wor&s;hip, from injury and oppre&s;&s;ion. Our appearance of terror, therefore, was entirely the &s;udden effect of habits which have not yet been eradicated from our minds.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Your apprehen&s;ions of danger from the &s;ight of a white man,</Q>
&s;aid I,
<Q>are natural. But in me&mdash; you behold a friend. I have been your advocate&mdash; and.</Q>
&mdash;Here, he interrupted me, and &s;aid,
<Q>Is not your name&mdash;?</Q>
I an&s;wered in the affirmative. Upon this he ran up and embraced me in his arms, and afterwards conducted me into the mid&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly, where, after being introduced to the prin|cipal characters, I was &s;eated upon a bank of mo&s;s; and the following account was delivered to me by the venerable per&s;on who fir&s;t acco&s;ted me.</P>
<P><Q>The place we now occupy, is called the <HI>paradi&s;e of negro &s;laves.</HI> It is de&s;tined to be our place of re&s;idence 'till the general judgement; after which time, we expect to be admitted into higher and more perfect degrees of happine&s;s.

mankind too often expo&s;e them&s;elves after death. Here we have learned to thank God, for all the afflic|tions our ta&s;k-ma&s;ters heaped on us; ina&s;much, as they were the means of our pre&s;ent happine&s;s. Pain and di&s;tre&s;s are the unavoidable portions of all mankind. They are the only po&s;&s;ible avenues that can conduct them to peace and felicity. Happy are they, who partake of their proportion of both up|on the earth.</Q>
Here he ended.&mdash;</P>
<P>After a &s;ilence of a few minutes, a young man, who bore on his head the mark of a wound, came up to me, and a&s;ked
<Q>If I knew any thing of Mr.&mdash;, of the I&s;land of&mdash;</Q>
I told him "I did not." &mdash;"Mr.&mdash;," &s;aid he,
<Q>was my ma&s;ter. One day, I mi&s;took his orders, and &s;addled his mare in|&s;tead of his hor&s;e, which provoked him &s;o much, that he took up an axe which laid in his yard, and with a &s;troke on my head, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me from life.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I long to hear, whether he has repented of this unkind action. Do, &s;ir, write to him, and tell him, his &s;in is not too great to be forgiven, tell him, his once mi&s;erable &s;lave, Scipio, is not angry at him &mdash;he longs to bear his prayers to the offended ma|je&s;ty of heaven&mdash;and&mdash;when he dies&mdash;Scipio will apply to be one of the convoy, that &s;hall conduct his &s;pirit to the regions of bli&s;s appointed for tho&s;e who repent of their iniquities.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Pre&s;ident and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY your unanimous vote, to honour with an Eulogium, the character of the late DR. WILLIAM CULLEN, Profe&s;&s;or of medecine in the Uni|ver&s;ity of Edinburgh, you have done equal homage to Science and Humanity. This illu&s;trious Phy&s;ician was the Preceptor of many of us:&mdash;He was moreover a di&s;tingui&s;hed citizen of the republic of Medecine, and a benefactor to Mankind; and although, like the &s;un, he &s;hone in a di&s;tant hemi&s;phere, yet many of the rays of his knowledge have fallen upon this quarter of the globe. I ri&s;e, therefore, to mingle your grateful prai&s;es of him, with the numerous offerings of public and private re&s;pect which have been paid to his me|mory in his native country. Happy will be the effects of &s;uch acts of di&s;tant &s;ympathy, if they &s;hould &s;erve to unite the influence of &s;cience with that of Com|merce, to le&s;&s;en the prejudices of nations again&s;t each other, and thereby to prepare the way for the operation of that divine &s;y&s;tem of morals, who&s;e
<PB N="322" REF="034495_0328_0FFE04018B98F2C8">
prerogative alone it is, to teach mankind that they are brethren, and to make the name of a fellow-creature, in every region of the world, a &s;ignal for brotherly affection.</P>
<P>In executing the ta&s;k you have impo&s;ed upon me, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to &s;uch parts of Dr. Cullen's character as came within the compa&s;s of my own knowledge, during two years re&s;idence in Edinburgh. &mdash;To his fellow citizens in Great Britain, who were more intimately acquainted with him, we mu&s;t re|&s;ign the hi&s;tory of his dome&s;tic character, as well as the detail of all tho&s;e &s;teps which, in early life, led him to his unparalleled height of u&s;efulne&s;s and fame.</P>
<P>Dr. CULLEN po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great and original genius. By genius, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, I mean a power in the human mind of di&s;covering the relation of di&s;tant truths, by the &s;horte&s;t train of intermediate propo&s;itions. This precious gift of Heaven, is com|po&s;ed of a vigorous imagination, quick &s;en&s;ibility, a talent for exten&s;ive and accurate ob&s;ervation, a faith|ful memory, and a &s;ound judgment. The&s;e faculties were all united in an eminent degree in the mind of Dr. Cullen. His imagination &s;urveyed all nature at a glance, and, like a camera ob&s;cura, &s;eemed to produce in his mind a picture of the whole vi&s;ible creation. His &s;en&s;ibility was &s;o exqui&s;ite, that the &s;malle&s;t portions of truth acted upon it. By means
<PB N="323" REF="034495_0329_0FFE04046D7037A8">
of his talent for ob&s;ervation he collected knowledge from every thing he heard, &s;aw, or read, and from eve|ry per&s;on with whom he conver&s;ed. His memory was the faithful repo&s;itory of all his ideas, and appeared to be alike accurate upon all &s;ubjects. Over each of the&s;e faculties of his mind a &s;ound judgment pre&s;ided, by means of which he di&s;covered the re|lation of ideas to each other, and thereby produced tho&s;e new combinations which con&s;titute principles in &s;cience. This proce&s;s of the mind has been called invention, and is totally different from a mere capacity of acquiring learning, or collecting knowledge from the di&s;coveries of others. It elevates man to a di&s;tant re&s;emblance of his Maker; for the di&s;|covery of truth, is the perception of things as they appear to the Divine Mind.</P>
<P>IN contemplating the human faculties, thus ex|qui&s;itely formed, and exactly balanced, we feel the &s;ame kind of plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from a view of a magnificent palace, or an exten&s;ive and variegated pro&s;pect; but with this difference, that the plea&s;ure, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, is as much &s;uperior to that which ari&s;es from contemplating the latter objects, as the mind of man is &s;uperior, in its importance, to the mo&s;t fini&s;hed productions of nature or of art.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not only the genius that has been de&s;cribed, but an uncommon &s;hare of learn|ing, reading, and knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="034495_0330_0FFE0409AA877768">His learning was of a peculiar and u&s;eful kind&mdash; He appeared to have over&s;tepped the &s;low and tedious forms of the &s;chools, and, by the force of his under|&s;tanding, to have &s;eized upon the great ends of learning, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of many of tho&s;e means which were contrived for the u&s;e of le&s;s active minds. He read the ancient. Greek and Roman writers only for the &s;ake of the knowledge which they contained, with out wa&s;ting any of the efforts of his genius in attempt|ing to imitate their &s;tyle. He was intimately acquaint|ed with modern languages, and through their means, with the improvements of medicine in every country in Europe. Such was the facility with which he acquired a language, and &s;o great was his enterpri&s;e in his re&s;earches in medicine, that I once heard him &s;peak of learning the Arabic for the &s;ake of reading Avicenna in the original, as if it were a matter of as little difficulty to him, as it was to compo&s;e a lecture, or to vi&s;it a patient.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN's reading was exten&s;ive, but it was not confined wholly to medicine. He read books upon all &s;ubjects; and he had a peculiar art of ex|tracting &s;omething from all of them which he made &s;ub&s;ervient to his profe&s;&s;ion. He was well acquaint|ed with ancient and modern hi&s;tory, and delighted in the poets, among whom Shake&s;peare was his favourite. The hi&s;tory of our globe, as unfolded by books of geography and travels, was &s;o familiar to him that &s;trangers could not conver&s;e with him, without
<PB N="325" REF="034495_0331_0FFE040B33098D40">
&s;uppo&s;ing that he had not only travelled, but that he had lived every where. His memory had no rubbi&s;h in it. Like a &s;ecretory organ, in the animal body, it it rejected every thing in reading that could not be applied to &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e. In this he has giv|en the world a mo&s;t valuable le&s;&s;on, for the difference between error and u&s;ele&s;s truth is very &s;mall; and a man is no wi&s;er for knowledge which he cannot apply, than he is rich from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing wealth, which he cannot &s;pend.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN's knowledge was minute in every branch of medicine. He was an accurate anatomi&s;t, and an ingenious phy&s;iologi&s;t. He enlarged the boun|daries, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the utility of Chemi&s;try, and thereby prepared the way for the di&s;coveries and fame of his illu&s;trious pupil Dr. Black. He &s;tripped Mate|ria Medica, of mo&s;t of the errors that had been accumulating in it for two thou&s;and years, and reduced it to a &s;imple and practical &s;cience. He was intimate|ly acquainted with all the branches of natural hi&s;tory and philo&s;ophy. He had &s;tudied every ancient and modern &s;y&s;tem of phy&s;ic. He found the &s;y&s;tem of Dr. Boerhave univer&s;ally adopted when he accepted a chair in the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh. This &s;y&s;tem was founded chiefly on the &s;uppo&s;ed pre&s;ence of cer|tain acrid particles in the fluids, and in the departure of the&s;e, in point of con&s;i&s;tency, from a natural &s;tate. Dr. Cullen's fir&s;t object was to expo&s;e the errors of this pathology; and to teach his pupils to &s;eek for
<PB N="326" REF="034495_0332_0FFE040CBAD2BF10">
the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es in the &s;olids. Nature is always coy. Ever &s;ince &s;he was driven from the heart, by the di&s;covery of the circulation of the blood, &s;he has concealed her&s;elf in the brain and nerves. Here &s;he has been pur&s;ued by Dr. Cullen; and if he has not dragged her to public view, he has left us a clue which mu&s;t in time conduct us to her la&s;t rece&s;s in the human body. Many, however, of the operations of nature in the nervous &s;y&s;tem have been explained by him; and no candid man will ever explain the whole of them, without acknowledging that the foun|dation of his &s;ucce&s;sful inquiries was laid by the di&s;coveries of Dr. Cullen.</P>
<P>He was intimately acquainted with the hi&s;tories and di&s;tinctions of the di&s;ea&s;es of all countries, ages, &s;ta|tions, occupations, and &s;tates of &s;ociety. While his great object was to explode u&s;ele&s;s remedies, he took pains to increa&s;e the influence of diet, dre&s;s, air, exer|ci&s;e, and the actions of the mind, in medicine. In a word he was a great practical phy&s;ician; and he has left behind him as many monuments of his &s;ucce&s;s in curing di&s;ea&s;es, as he has of accuracy and ingenuity in de&s;cribing their &s;ymptoms and explaining their cau&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT his knowledge was not confined wholly to tho&s;e &s;ciences which are intimately connected with medicine. His genius was univer&s;al, as to natural and artificial &s;ubjects. He was minutely acquainted
<PB N="327" REF="034495_0333_0FFE040F8311BC70">
with the principles and practices of all the liberal, mechanical, and chemical arts; and trade&s;men were often directed by him to new objects of ob&s;ervation and improvement in their re&s;pective occupations. He delighted in the &s;tudy of agriculture, and contributed much to excite that ta&s;te for agricultural &s;cience, which has of late years &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed the men of genius and lei&s;ure in North-Britain. I have been informed, that he yielded at la&s;t to that pa&s;&s;ion for rural improvements, which is common to all men, and amu&s;ed him&s;elf in the evening of his life by cul|tivating a farm in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. Happy would it be for the intere&s;ts of agriculture, if phy&s;icians in all countries, would imitate Dr. Cullen by an attachment to this noble &s;cience; for their previous &s;tudies are of &s;uch a nature as frequently to enable them to arrive at improvements in it without experiments, and to apply the experiments of others, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and profitable manner.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN's publications were few in number compared with his di&s;coveries. They con&s;i&s;t of his Elements of phy&s;iology, his No&s;ologia Methodica, his Fir&s;t Lines of the Practice of Phy&s;ic, an E&s;&s;ay upon the cold produced by Evaporation, publi&s;hed in the &s;econd volume of the Phy&s;ical and Literary E&s;&s;ays of Edinburgh, a Letter to Lord Cathcart upon the method of recovering per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead from drown|ing, and a &s;y&s;tem of the Materia Medica. The&s;e are all the works which bear his name; but the fruits of
<PB N="328" REF="034495_0334_0FFE0414B3546950">
his inquiries are to be found in mo&s;t of the medical publications that have appeared in Great-Britain with|in the la&s;t thirty years. Many of the the&s;es, publi&s;hed in Edinburgh during his life, were the vehicles of his opinions or practice in medicine: and few of them contained an important or u&s;eful di&s;covery, which was not derived from hints thrown out in his lectures.</P>
<P>As a TEACHER of medicine, Dr. Cullen po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many peculiar talents. He mingled the mo&s;t agreea|ble eloquence with the mo&s;t profound di&s;qui&s;itions. He appeared to <HI>lighten</HI> upon every &s;ubject upon which he &s;poke. His language was &s;imple, and his arrange|ment methodical, by which means he was always intelligible. From the moment he a&s;cended his chair, he commanded the mo&s;t re&s;pectful attention from his pupils, in&s;omuch that I never &s;aw one of them di&s;co|ver a &s;ign of impatience during the time of any of his lectures.</P>
<P>IN the inve&s;tigation of truth, he &s;ometimes ventured into the regions of conjecture. His imagination was an hot-bed of hypothe&s;es, which led him to con&s;tant ob&s;ervation and experiment. The&s;e often proved the &s;eeds of &s;ub&s;equent di&s;coveries. It was thus Sir I&s;aac Newton founded an empire in &s;cience; for mo&s;t of his di&s;coveries were the re&s;ult of preconceived hypothe&s;es. In delivering new opinions, Dr. Cullen pre&s;erved the &s;tricte&s;t integrity. I have known him more than once, refute the opnions which he had taught the preceding year, even before the fallacy of them had
<PB N="329" REF="034495_0335_0FFE041640AA0370">
been &s;u&s;pected by any of his pupils. Such in&s;tances of candor often pa&s;s with the vulgar for in&s;tability; but they are the true&s;t characteri&s;tics of a great mind. To be unchangeable, &s;uppo&s;es perpetual error, or a per|ception of truth without the u&s;e of rea&s;on; but this &s;ublime act of intuition belongs only to the Deity.</P>
<P>There was no tincture of credulity in the mind of Dr. Cullen. He taught his pupils the nece&s;&s;ity of acquiring "the &s;low con&s;enting academic doubt." I mention the&s;e words of the poet with peculiar plea|&s;ure, as I find them in my notes of one of his lec|tures, in which he has delivered rules for judging of the truth of things related as facts; for he frequent|ly remarked that there were ten fal&s;e facts (if the ex|pre&s;&s;ion can be allowed) to one fal&s;e opinion in medicine. His Materia Medica abounds with proofs of the truth of this part of his character. With how much caution does he admit the efficacy of medicines, as related in books, or as &s;ugge&s;ted by his own experience. Who could have expected to have found &s;o much mode&s;ty in the writings of a phy&s;ician in the 77th year of his age? But let it be remembered, that this phy&s;ician was Dr. Cullen; and that he always preferred utility to novelty, and loved truth, more than fame.</P>
<P>He took great pains to deliver his pupils from the undue influence which antiquity and great names are apt to have upon the human mind. He de|&s;troyed
<PB N="330" REF="034495_0336_0FFE0417C92FB328">
the &s;uper&s;titious veneration which had been paid for many ages to the names of Hippocrates, Galen, and other ancient authors, and in&s;pired his pupils with a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the writings of modern phy&s;icians. His con&s;tant aim was to produce in their minds a change from a pa&s;&s;ive to an active &s;tate; and to force upon them &s;uch habits of think|ing and ob&s;ervation, as &s;hould enable them to in&s;truct them&s;elves.</P>
<P>As he admitted no truth without examination, &s;o he &s;ubmitted to no cu&s;tom in propagating it that was not rea&s;onable. He had a principal &s;hare in the merit of delivering medicine from the fetters of the Latin, and introducing the Engli&s;h language, as the vehicle of public in&s;truction in the univer&s;ity of Edinburgh. Much of the &s;ucce&s;s of the revolution he effected in medicine, I believe, may be a&s;cribed to this circum&s;tance. Perhaps the many improvements which have lately been made in medicine in the Briti&s;h dominions, may likewi&s;e be a&s;cribed to the pre&s;ent fa&s;hionable cu&s;tom of communicating medical know|ledge in the Engli&s;h language. By this means, our &s;cience has excited the notice and inquiries of in|genious and ob&s;erving men in all profe&s;&s;ions, and there|by a kind of galaxy has been created in the hemi&s;phere of medicine. By a&s;&s;uming an Engli&s;h dre&s;s, it has moreover been prepared more ea&s;ily to a&s;&s;ociate with other &s;ciences; from each of which it has received a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="034495_0337_0FFE041A8CC12300">In his intercour&s;e with his pupils Dr. Cullen was truly kind and affectionate. Never have I known a man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a higher degree tho&s;e qualities which &s;eize upon every affection of the heart. He knew the rare and happy arts, as circum&s;tances requi|red, of being affable without being &s;ociable; &s;ociable without being familiar; and familiar, without lo&s;ing a particle of re&s;pect. Such was the intere&s;t he took in the health, &s;tudies, and future e&s;tabli&s;hment of all his pupils, that each of them believed that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a pre-eminence in his friend&s;hip; while the equal diffu&s;ion of his kind offices proved that he was the common friend and father of them all. Sometimes he would lay a&s;ide the di&s;tance, without le&s;&s;ening the dignity of the profe&s;&s;or, and mix with his pupils at his table upon terms of the mo&s;t endearing equality. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions his &s;ocial affections &s;eemed to have an influence upon his mind. Science, &s;entiment, and convivial humor, appeared for hours together to &s;trive which &s;hould predominate in his conver&s;ation. I appeal to you, gentlemen, who have &s;hared in the plea&s;ure which I have de&s;cribed, for the ju&s;tice of the picture which I have drawn of him at his ho&s;pitable table. You will recollect, with me&punc; how agreeably he accommodated him&s;elf to our different capacities and tempers; how kindly he di&s;&s;ipated our youthful blu&s;hes, by inviting us to a&s;k him que&s;tions; and how much he taught us, by his inquiries, of the nature of the &s;oil, climate, products, and di&s;ea&s;es of even our own country.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="034495_0338_0FFE041D4E0CDCE0">From the hi&s;tory that has been given of Dr. Cullen, we &s;hall not be &s;urpri&s;ed at the reputation which he gave to the univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, for upwards of thirty years. The city of Edinburgh during his life became the very atmo&s;phere of medicine. But let me not here be unju&s;t to the merits of his illu&s;trious colleagues. The names of Whytt, Rutherford, the Monroes, Black, the Gregories, Hope, and Home, will always be dear to the lovers of medical &s;cience. May every healing plant bloom upon the graves of tho&s;e of them who are departed! and may tho&s;e who have &s;urvived him, together with their new a&s;&s;ociate, the learned and excellent Dr. Duncan, long continue to maintain the honor of that ju&s;tly celebrated &s;chool of medicine!</P>
<P>It remains now that I add a &s;hort account of Dr. Cullen's conduct as a phy&s;ician and a man.</P>
<P>In his attendance upon his patients, he made their health his fir&s;t object, and thereby confirmed a line between the mechanical and liberal profe&s;&s;ions; for while wealth is pur&s;ued by the former, as the end of labour, it &s;hould be left by the latter, to follow the more noble exertions of the mind. So gentle and &s;ympathizing was Dr. Cullen's manner in a &s;ick room, that pain and di&s;tre&s;s &s;eemed to be &s;u&s;pended in his pre&s;ence. Hope followed his foot&s;teps, and death appeared frequently to drop his commi&s;&s;ion in a com|bat with his &s;kill. He was compa&s;&s;ionate and charita|ble to the poor; and from his pupils, who con&s;ulted
<PB N="333" REF="034495_0339_0FFE0421690A12B0">
him in &s;ickne&s;s, he con&s;tantly refu&s;ed to receive any pecuniary &s;atisfaction for his &s;ervices.</P>
<P>In his intercour&s;e with the world he exhibited the manners of a well-bred gentleman. He exerci&s;ed up|on all occa&s;ions the agreeable art, in which true po|litene&s;s is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t, of &s;peaking with civility, and li&s;tening with attention to every body. His con|ver&s;ation was at all times animated, agreeable, and in&s;tructing. Few per&s;ons went into his company without learning &s;omething; and even a common thought, by pa&s;&s;ing through his mind, received an impre&s;&s;ion, which made it ever afterwards worthy of being pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>He was a &s;trict oeconomi&s;t of time. He &s;eldom went out of his hou&s;e in his carriage, or a &s;edan chair, without a book in his hand; and he once told me, that he frequently employed one of his &s;ons to read to him after he went to bed, that he might not lo&s;e that portion of time which pa&s;&s;es between lying down, and falling a&s;leep.</P>
<P>He was remarkably punctual to all his profe&s;&s;ional engagements. He appeared to con&s;ider time as a &s;pecies of property, which no man had a right to take from another without his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>It was by means of his oeconomy and punctuality in the u&s;e of time, that he accompli&s;hed &s;o much in his profe&s;&s;ion. I have read of &s;ome men who have &s;pent more time in their clo&s;ets, and of others who have
<PB N="334" REF="034495_0340_0FFE04242C48BF08">
done more bu&s;ine&s;s; but I have never read, nor heard of a man, who mingled more &s;tudy and bu&s;ine&s;s together. He lived by rule, without &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to the &s;lavery of forms. He was always employed, but never in a hurry; and amid&s;t the numerous and complicated avocations of &s;tudy and bu&s;ine&s;s, he appeared to enjoy the plea&s;ure of &s;ociety, as if company-keeping and con|ver&s;ation were the only bu&s;ine&s;s of his life.</P>
<P>I &s;hall mention but one more trait in the character of Dr. Cullen, and that is, that he was di&s;tingui&s;hed by no one &s;ingularity of behaviour from other men. It is true he &s;tood alone; but this &s;ingularity was occa&s;ioned, not by his quitting the &s;ociety of his fellow-men by walking on their left, or right &s;ide, but by his walking before them. Eccentricities in behaviour are the off|&s;pring of a lively fancy only, but order is in&s;eparably connected with real genius. The actions of the former may be compared to the crooked fla&s;h of di&s;tant light|ning, while the latter re&s;embles in its movements the &s;teady revolutions of the heavenly bodies.</P>
<P>In reviewing the character which has been given of Dr. Cullen, I am forced to make a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion, while I do homage to the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic by a &s;in|gle remark. So great are the ble&s;&s;ings which mankind derive from it, that if every other argument failed to prove the admini&s;tration of a providence in human affairs, the profe&s;&s;ion of medicine alone would be &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e. Who can think of the ta|lents, virtues, and &s;ervices of Dr. Cullen, without be|lieving
<PB N="335" REF="034495_0341_0FFE0425C45A26A8">
that the Creator of the world delights in the happine&s;s of his creatures, and that his tender mer|cies are over all his works!</P>
<P>For the information of &s;uch of the members of our college as have not &s;een Dr. Cullen, it may not be improper to add the following de&s;cription of his per|&s;on. He was tall, &s;lender, and had a &s;toop in his &s;houlders; his face was long; his under lip protruded a little beyond the upper; his no&s;e was large, and inclined to a point downwards; his eye, which was of a blue color, was penetrating, but &s;oft; and over his whole face was diffu&s;ed an air of mildne&s;s and thought, which was &s;trongly characteri&s;tic of the con&s;tant temper and operations of his mind.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed God to prolong his life to a good old age. He lived near 78 years. He lived to demon&s;trate how much the duration of all the faculties of the mind de|pends upon their con&s;tant exerci&s;e. He lived to teach his brethren by his example, that the obligations to ac|quire and communicate knowledge, &s;hould cea&s;e only with health and life; and la&s;tly, he lived to reap the fruits of his labors in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive fame; for not only his pupils, and his works, had conveyed his re|putation; but canva&s;s, paper, and clay, had borne e|ven the image of his per&s;on to every quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>The public papers, as well as private letters, inform us, that he &s;urvived his u&s;efulne&s;s but a few months. He re&s;igned his profe&s;&s;or&s;hip in the autumn of 1789,
<PB N="336" REF="034495_0342_0FFE042B0007BC78">
on account of bodily weakne&s;s, and died in the month of January of the pre&s;ent year; a year fatal to the pride of man; for this year Franklin and Howard, as well as Cullen, have mingled with the du&s;t. During the interval between his re&s;ignation and his death he receiv|ed the mo&s;t affectionate marks of public and private re&s;pect. The city of Edinburgh voted him their thanks, and pre&s;ented him with a piece of plate. This in&s;tance of public gratitude de&s;erves our particular attention, as it is more common for cities to treat their eminent li|terary characters with neglect during their lives, and centuries afterwards to contend for the honor of hav|ing given them birth. The different medical &s;ocieties of Edinburgh followed him to his chamber with ad|dre&s;&s;es full of gratitude and affection. In mentioning the&s;e facts, I am led to contemplate the venerable &s;ub|ject of our prai&s;es in a &s;ituation truly &s;olemn and inte|re&s;ting. How pregnant with in&s;truction is the death-bed of a phy&s;ician, who has &s;pent a long life in exten|&s;ive and &s;ucce&s;sful practice! If the &s;orrows we have relieved are the &s;ure&s;t &s;upport in our own, how great mu&s;t have been the con&s;olation which Dr. Cullen de|rived, in his la&s;t hours, from a review of his active and u&s;eful life! How many fathers and mothers, hu&s;bands and wives, brothers and &s;i&s;ters, who&s;e tears he had wiped away by averting the &s;troke of death from the objects of their affections, mu&s;t have pre&s;ented them|&s;elves to his imagination, and &s;oothed his &s;oul with grateful prayers for his eternal welfare! But the retro&s;|pect of the &s;ervices he had rendered to his fellow-crea|tures,
<PB N="337" REF="034495_0343_0FFE042C881C6698">
was not confined to the limits of his exten&s;ive bu&s;ine&s;s in the city of Edinburgh. While the illu&s;tri|ous actions of mo&s;t men may be viewed with a naked eye, the atchievements of Dr. Cullen in the di&s;tant re|gions of humanity and &s;cience, can only be perceived by the help of a tele&s;cope. Let us apply this in&s;trument to di&s;cover his exploits of beneficence in every quarter of the world. He had filled the capitals, and mo&s;t of the towns of Great Britain and Ireland with eminent phy&s;icians. Many of his pupils had arrived at the fir&s;t honors in their profe&s;&s;ion in the principal cities on the continent of Europe. Many of them had extended the ble&s;&s;ings of his improvements in the principles and prac|tice of medicine, to every Briti&s;h &s;ettlement in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, and to every free &s;tate in America. But the &s;um of his u&s;efulne&s;s did not end here. He had taught the different profe&s;&s;ors in the Univer&s;ity of Penn&s;ylvania, the art of teaching others the mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sful methods of curing di&s;ea&s;es, and thereby he had conveyed the benefits of his di&s;coveries into every part of the United States. How great was the ma&s;s of &s;uch accumulated beneficence! and how &s;ublime mu&s;t have been the plea&s;ure which the review of it created in his mind! Had it been po&s;&s;ible for the merit of &s;uch exten|&s;ive and complicated &s;ervices to mankind to have re&s;cu|ed one mortal from the grave, Dr. Cullen had never di|ed. But the decree of death is univer&s;al, and even the healing art, is finally of no effect in &s;aving the lives of
<PB N="338" REF="034495_0344_0FFE042E367A7CC8">
tho&s;e who have exerci&s;ed it with the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s in &s;aving the lives of others.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN is now no more. What a blank has been produced by his death in the great volume of Science! Behold! The genius of humanity weep|ing at his feet, while the genius of medicine lifts up the key, which fell from his hand with his la&s;t breath, and with inexpre&s;&s;ible concern, cries out, "to whom &s;hall I give this in&s;trument? Who now will unlock for me the trea&s;ures of univer&s;al nature?"</P>
<P>Venerable Shade, adieu! What though thy Amer|ican pupils were denied the melancholy plea&s;ure of following thee from thy Profe&s;&s;or's-chair to thy &s;ick bed, with their effu&s;ions of gratitude, and prai&s;e! What though we did not &s;hare in the grief of thy funeral ob&s;equies, and though we &s;hall never bedew with our tears the &s;plendid monument which thy affectionate and grateful Briti&s;h pupils have decreed for thee in the metropolis of thy native country; yet the remembrance of thy talents and virtues, &s;hall be pre&s;erved in each of our bo&s;oms, and never &s;hall we return in triumph from beholding the efficacy of medicine in curing a di&s;ea&s;e, without feeling our obligations for the in&s;tructions we have derived from thee!</P>
<P>I repeat it again, Dr. Cullen is now no more&mdash; No more, I mean, a pillar and ornament of an an|cient &s;eat of &s;cience&mdash;no more, the delight and ad|miration
<PB N="339" REF="034495_0345_0FFE0430F819FBF8">
of his pupils&mdash;no more the luminary of medicine to half the globe&mdash;no more the friend and benefactor of mankind.&mdash;But I would as &s;oon be|lieve that our &s;olar &s;y&s;tem was created only to amu&s;e and peri&s;h like a rocket, as believe that a mind endowed with &s;uch immen&s;e powers of action and contemplation had cea&s;ed to exi&s;t. Rea&s;on bids us hope that he will yet <HI>live</HI>&mdash;And Revelation ena|bles us to &s;ay, with certainty and confidence, that he &s;hall again <HI>live.</HI>&mdash;Fain would I lift the curtain which &s;eparates eternity from time, and inquire&mdash; But it is not for mortals to pry into the &s;ecrets of the invi&s;ible world.</P>
<P>Such was the man who&s;e memory we have en|deavoured to celebrate. He lived for our benefit. It remains only that we improve the event of his death in &s;uch a manner&punc; that he may die for our benefit likewi&s;e. For this purpo&s;e I &s;hall fini&s;h our Eulogium with the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">I. Let us learn from the character of Dr. Cullen duly to e&s;timate our profe&s;&s;ion. While A&s;tronomy claims a Newton, and Electricity a Franklin, Medi|cine has been equally honoured by having employ|ed the genius of a Cullen. Whenever therefore we feel our&s;elves di&s;po&s;ed to relax in our &s;tudies, to u&s;e our profe&s;&s;ion for &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es, or to neglect the poor&punc; let us recollect how much we le&s;&s;en the dignity which Dr. Cullen has conferred upon our profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="340" REF="034495_0346_0FFE04363856FD28">II. By the death of Dr. Cullen the republic of medicine has lo&s;t one of its mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed and u&s;eful members. It is incumbent upon us therefore to double our diligence in order to &s;upply the lo&s;s of our indefatigable fellow-citizen. That phy&s;ician has lived to little purpo&s;e, who does not leave his profe&s;&s;ion in a more improved &s;tate than he found it. Let us remember, that our obligations to add &s;omething to the capital of medical knowledge, are equally binding with our obligations to practi&s;e the virtues of integrity and humanity in our intercour&s;e with our patients. Let no u&s;eful fact therefore, however incon&s;iderable it may appear, be kept back from the public eye; for there are mites in &s;cience as well as in charity, and the remote con&s;equences of both are often alike important and beneficial. Facts are the morality of medicine. They are the &s;ame in all ages and in all countries. They have pre&s;erved the works of the immortal Sy|denham from being de&s;troyed by their mixture with his ab&s;urd theories; and under all the revolutions in &s;y&s;tems that will probably take place hereafter, the facts which are contained in Dr. Cullen's works, will con&s;titute the be&s;t &s;ecurity for their &s;afe and grateful reception by future ages.</P>

great a regard for his authority in medicine. I well remember an ob&s;ervation &s;uited to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e which he delivered in his introduction to a cour&s;e of lectures on the In&s;titutes of Medicine in the year 1766. After &s;peaking of the long continued and exten&s;ive empire of Galen in the &s;chools of phy&s;ic, he &s;aid,
<Q>It is a great di&s;advantage to any &s;cience to have been improved by a great man. His authority impo&s;es indolence, timidity, or idolatry upon all who come after him.</Q>
&mdash;Let us avoid the&s;e evils in our venera|tion for Dr. Cullen. To believe in great men, is often as great an ob&s;tacle to the progre&s;s of knowledge, as to believe in witches and conjurers. It is the image wor&s;hip of &s;cience; for error is as much an attribute of man, as the de&s;ire of happine&s;s; and I think I have ob&s;erved, that the errors of great men partake of the dimen&s;ions of their minds, and are often of a greater magnitude than the errors of men of inferior under|&s;tanding. Dr. Brown has proved the imperfection of human genius, by extending &s;ome parts of Dr. Cullen's &s;y&s;tem of phy&s;ic, and by correcting &s;ome of its defects. But he has left much to be done by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. He has even bequeathed to them the labor of removing the errors he has introduced into medicine by his ne|glect of an important principle in the animal oecono|my, and by his ignorance of the hi&s;tories and &s;ymp|toms of di&s;ea&s;es. Perhaps no &s;y&s;tem of medicine can be perfect, while there exi&s;ts a &s;ingle di&s;ea&s;e which we do not know, or cannot cure. If this be true, then a
<PB N="342" REF="034495_0348_0FFE04394B884928">
complete &s;y&s;tem of medicine cannot be formed, till America has furni&s;hed de&s;criptions and cures of all her peculiar di&s;ea&s;es. The United States have improv|ed the &s;cience of civil government. The freedom of our con&s;titutions, by imparting vigor and indepen|dence to the mind, is favourable to bold and original thinking upon all &s;ubjects. Let us avail our&s;elves therefore of this political aid to our re&s;earches, and endeavour to obtain hi&s;tories and cures of all our di&s;|ea&s;es, that we may thereby contribute our part to|wards the formation of a complete &s;y&s;tem of medicine. As a religion of &s;ome kind is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to promote morals; &s;o &s;y&s;tems of medicine of &s;ome kind, are equally nece&s;&s;ary to produce a regular mode of practice. They are not only nece&s;&s;ary, but unavoida|ble in medicine; for no phy&s;ician, nay more, no empire, practices without them.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent is an age of great improvement. While the application of rea&s;on to the &s;ciences of government and religion, is daily meliorating the condition of man|kind, it is agreeable to ob&s;erve the influence of medi|cine, in le&s;&s;ening human mi&s;ery, by abating the mor|tality or violence of many di&s;ea&s;es. The decrees of heaven appear to be fulfilling by natural means; and if no ancient prophecies had declared it, the late nu|merous di&s;coveries in medicine would authorize us to &s;ay, that the time is approaching, when not only ty|ranny, di&s;cord and &s;uper&s;tition &s;hall cea&s;e from our world, but when di&s;ea&s;es &s;hall be unknown, or cea&s;e

to be incurable; and when old age &s;hall be the only outlet of human life,
<Q>"Thus heavenward all things tend."</Q>
In that glorious aera, every di&s;covery in medicine &s;hall meet with its full reward; and the more abundant gra|titude of po&s;terity to the name of Dr. Cullen; &s;hall then bury in oblivion the feeble attempt of this day to comply with your vote to perpetuate his fame.</P>

<HEAD>AN EULOGIUM UPON DAVID RITTENHOUSE, LATE PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY; DELIVERED BE|FORE THE SOCIETY IN THE FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH IN HIGH-STREET, PHILADELPHIA, ON THE 17TH DECEMBER, 1796, AGREEABLY TO APPOINTMENT, AND PUBLISHED AT THE REQUEST OF THE SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Philo&s;ophical Society. Friends and Colleagues,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are a&s;&s;embled this day upon a mournful occa&s;ion. Death has made an inroad upon our Society. Our illu&s;trious and beloved PRE|SIDENT, is no more. RITTENHOUSE, the ingenious, the mode&s;t and the wi&s;e&mdash;RITTENHOUSE, the friend of God and man, is now no more!&mdash;For this, the temple of Science is hung in mourning&mdash;for this, our eyes now drop a tributary tear. Nor do we weep alone.&mdash;The United States of America &s;ympathize in our grief, for his name gave a &s;plendor to the American character, and the friends of humanity in di&s;tant parts
<PB N="344" REF="034495_0350_0FFE04415C0AE4E0">
of the world, unite with us in lamenting our common lo&s;s&mdash;for he belonged to the whole human race.</P>
<P>By your vote to perpetuate the memory of this great and good man, you have made a laudable attempt to re&s;cue philo&s;ophers from their humble rank in the hi&s;tory of mankind. It is to them we owe our know|ledge and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mo&s;t of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life. To procure the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings for us, "they trim their midnight lamp, and hang o'er the &s;ickly taper." For us, they traver&s;e di&s;tant regions, expo&s;e them&s;elves to the inclemencies of the weather, mingle with &s;avages and bea&s;ts of prey, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, evince their love of &s;cience and humanity by the &s;acrifice of their lives.</P>
<P>The amiable philo&s;opher who&s;e talents and virtues are to be the &s;ubject of the following eulogium, is entitled to an uncommon portion of our gratitude and prai&s;e. He acquired his knowledge at the expen&s;e of uncommon exertions, he performed &s;ervices of uncom|mon difficulty, and finally he impaired his health, and probably &s;hortened his life, by the ardor of his &s;tudies and labors for the benefit of mankind.</P>
<P>In attempting to di&s;charge the difficult and painful duty you have a&s;&s;igned to me, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give a &s;hort account of the life of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e, ina&s;much as &s;everal of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting parts of his character are intimately connected with it.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="034495_0351_0FFE0442E3EAA808">The village of Germantown in the neighbourhood of this city, had the honor of giving birth to this di&s;|tingui&s;hed philo&s;opher on the 8th day of April, in the year 1732. His ance&s;tors migrated from Holland about the beginning of the pre&s;ent century. They were di&s;tingui&s;hed, together with his parents, for probity, indu&s;try, and &s;imple manners. It is from &s;ources thus pure and retired, that tho&s;e talents and virtues have been chiefly derived, which have in all ages enlightened the world. They prove by their hum|ble origin, that the Supreme Being has not &s;urrendered up the direction of human affairs to the advantages acquired by accident or vice, and they bear a con&s;tant and faithful te&s;timony of his impartial goodne&s;s, by their nece&s;&s;ary and regular influence in equalizing the condition of mankind. This is the divine order of things, and every attempt to invert it, is a weak and unavailing effort to wre&s;t the government of the world from the hands of God.</P>
<P>The early part of the life of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e was &s;pent in agricultural employments under the eye of his father, in the county of Montgomery, twenty miles from Philadelphia, to which place he removed during the childhood of his Son. It was at this place his peculiar genius fir&s;t di&s;covered it&s;elf. His plough, the fences, and even the &s;tones of the field in which he worked, were frequently marked with figures which denoted a talent for mathematical &s;tudies. Upon
<PB N="346" REF="034495_0352_0FFE04446D6961A8">
finding that the native delicacy of his con&s;titution un|fitted him for the labors of hu&s;bandry, his parents con&s;ented to his learning the trade of a clock and mathematical in&s;trument maker. In acquiring the knowledge of the&s;e u&s;eful arts, he was his own in&s;truc|tor. &mdash;They afforded him great delight, ina&s;much as they favoured his di&s;po&s;ition to inquire into the prin|ciples of natural philo&s;ophy.&mdash;Con&s;tant employment of any kind, even in the practice of the mechanical arts, has been found, in many in&s;tances, to admini&s;ter vigor to human genius. Franklin &s;tudied the laws of nature, while he handled his printing types. The father of Rou&s;&s;eau, a jeweller at Geneva, became acquainted with the principles of national juri&s;prudence, by li&s;ten|ing to his &s;on while he read to him in his &s;hop, the works of Grotius and Puffendorf; and Her&s;chel conceived the great idea of a new planet, while he exerci&s;ed the humble office of a mu&s;ician to a marching regiment.</P>
<P>It was during the re&s;idence of our ingenious philo|&s;opher with his father in the country, that he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Sir I&s;aac Newton's Principia, which he read in the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation of Mr. Mott. It was here likewi&s;e he became acquainted with the &s;ci|ence of Fluxions, of which &s;ublime invention he believed him&s;elf for a while to be the author, nor did he know for &s;ome years afterwards, that a conte&s;t had been carried on between Sir I&s;aac Newton and Leibnitz, for the honor of that great and u&s;eful di&s;covery. What
<PB N="347" REF="034495_0353_0FFE04473AACE3A8">
a mind was here!&mdash;Without literary friends or &s;ociety, and with but two or three books, he became, before he had reached his four and twentieth year, the rival of the two greate&s;t mathematicians in Europe!</P>
<P>It was in this retired &s;ituation, and while employed in working at his trade, that he planned and executed an orrery, in which he repre&s;ented the revolutions of the heavenly bodies in a manner more exten&s;ive and complete, than had been done by any former a&s;trono|mers. A correct de&s;cription of this orrery drawn up by the Rev. Dr. Smith, is publi&s;hed in the fir&s;t volume of our Tran&s;actions. This ma&s;ter-piece of ingenious mechani&s;m was purcha&s;ed by the college of New-Jer&s;ey. A &s;econd was made by him, after the &s;ame model, for the u&s;e of the college of Philadelphia. It now forms part of the philo&s;ophical apparatus of the Univer&s;ity of Penn&s;ylvania, where it has for many years com|manded the admiration of the ingenious and the learned, from every part of the world.</P>
<P>The reputation he derived from the con&s;truction of this orrery, as well as his general character for mathematical knowledge, attracted the notice of his fellow-citizens in Penn&s;ylvania, and in &s;everal of the neighbouring &s;tates, but the di&s;covery of his uncommon merit belonged chiefly to his brother-in-law, the Rev. Mr. Barton, Dr. Smith, and the late Mr. John Lukens, an ingenious mathematician of this city. The&s;e gen|tlemen fully appreciated his talents, and united in
<PB N="348" REF="034495_0354_0FFE044A04936EB8">
urging him to remove to Philadelphia, in order to enlarge his opportunities of improvement and u&s;eful|ne&s;s. He yielded with reluctance to their advice, and exchanged his beloved retirement in the country for this city, in the year 1770. Here he continued for &s;everal years, to follow his occupation of a clock and mathematical in&s;trument maker. He excelled in both branches of that bu&s;ine&s;s. His mathematical in&s;tru|ments have been e&s;teemed by good judges to be &s;upe|rior in accuracy and workman&s;hip to any of the &s;ame kind that have been imported from Europe.</P>
<P>About the time he &s;ettled in Philadelphia, he became a member of our Society. His fir&s;t commu|nication to the Society was a calculation of the tran&s;it of Venus as it was to happen on the 3d of June, 1769, in 40&deg; north latitude, and 5 hours we&s;t longitude from Greenwich. He was one of a committee appointed by the Society to ob&s;ereve in the town&s;hip of Norri|ton, this rare occurence in the revolution, of that planet, and bore an active part in the preparations which were made for that purpo&s;e. Of this Dr. Smith who was likewi&s;e of the committee, has left an honoura|ble record in the hi&s;tory of that event which is pub|li&s;hed in the fir&s;t volume of the tran&s;actions of our Society. "As Mr. Rittenhou&s;e's dwelling (&s;ays the Doctor) is about twenty miles north we&s;t from Phila|delphia; our other engagements did not permit Mr. Lu|kens or my&s;elf to pay much attention to the nece&s;&s;ary preparations; but we knew that we had intru&s;ted them
<PB N="349" REF="034495_0355_0FFE044F384EA858">
to a gentleman on the &s;pot [meaning Mr. Rittenhou&s;e] who had, joined to a complete &s;kill in mechanics, &s;o exten&s;ive an a&s;tronomical, and mathematical know|ledge, that the u&s;e, management and even con&s;truc|tion of the apparatus, were perfectly familiar to him. The laudable pains he had taken in the&s;e material articles will be&s;t appear from the work it&s;elf, which he hath committed into my hands, with a mode&s;t introduction, giving me a liberty with them, which his own accuracy, ta&s;te and abilities leave no room to exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>We are naturally led here to take a view of our philo&s;opher with his a&s;&s;ociates in their preparations to ob&s;erve a phaenomenon which had never been &s;een but twice before by any inhabitant of our earth, which would never be &s;een again by any per&s;on then living, and on which depended very important a&s;tro|nomical con&s;equences. The night before the long expected day, was probably pa&s;&s;ed in a degree of &s;olicitude which precluded &s;leep. How great mu&s;t have been their joy when they beheld the morning &s;un, "and the whole horizon without a cloud;" for &s;uch is the de&s;cription of the day given by Mr. Rittenhou&s;e in the report referred to by Dr. Smith. In pen&s;ive &s;ilence, and trembling anxiety, they wait|ed for the predicted moment of ob&s;ervation; it came, and brought with it all that had been wi&s;hed for and expected by tho&s;e who &s;aw it. In our philo&s;oper, it excited in the in&s;tant of one of the
<PB N="350" REF="034495_0356_0FFE0450C563CE78">
contacts of the planet with the &s;un, an emotion of delight &s;o exqui&s;ite and powerful, as to induce fainting. This will readily be believed by tho&s;e who have known the extent of that plea&s;ure which attends the di&s;covery, or fir&s;t perception of truth. Soon after this event, we find him acting as one of a com|mittee appointed to ob&s;erve the tran&s;it of Mercury on the 9th of November in the &s;ame year. This was likewi&s;e done at Norriton, An account of it was drawn up, and publi&s;hed at the reque&s;t of the com|mittee by Dr. Smith. A minute hi&s;tory of the whole of the&s;e events, in which Mr. Rittenhou&s;e continued to act a di&s;tingui&s;hed part, is given in our tran&s;acti|ons. It was received with great &s;atisfaction by the a&s;tronomers of Europe, and contributed much to rai&s;e the character of our then infant country for a&s;tronomical knowledge.</P>
<P>In the year 1775, he was appointed to compo&s;e and deliver the annual oration before our &s;ociety. The &s;ubject of it, was the hi&s;tory of a&s;tronomy. The language of this oration is &s;imple, but the &s;entiments contained in it are ingenious, original, and in &s;ome in&s;tances &s;ublime. It was delivered in a feeble voice, and without any of the advantages of oratory, but it commanded notwith&s;tanding, the mo&s;t profound attention, and was followed by univer&s;al admiration and applau&s;e from a crouded and re&s;pectable audience.</P>
<P>From the contents of this oration, it appears that A&s;tronomy was the favourite object of his &s;tudies.
<PB N="351" REF="034495_0357_0FFE04524F7D9F38">
Attempts have been made to depreciate this branch of natural philo&s;ophy, by denying its utility, and ap|plication to human affairs.&mdash;The opinion is an unju&s;t one, and as it tends to convey a limited idea of the ta|lents of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e, I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed in &s;aying a few words in favour of this &s;cience.</P>
<P>It is to a&s;tronomy we are indebted for our know|ledge of navigation, by which means the different parts of our globe have been di&s;covered, and afterwards cemented together by the mutual wants and obligations of commerce.</P>
<P>It was a&s;tronomy that taught mankind the art of predicting and explaining eclip&s;es of the Sun and Moon, and thereby delivered them from the &s;uper&s;tition which in the early ages of the world, was connected with tho&s;e phaenomena of nature.</P>
<P>We are taught by a&s;tronomy to correct our ideas of the vi&s;ible heavens, and thus by di&s;covering the fallacy of the &s;imple evidence of our &s;en&s;es, to call to their aid, the u&s;e of our rea&s;on, in deciding upon all material objects of human knowledge.</P>
<P>A&s;tronomy delivers the mind from a groveling attachment to the pur&s;uits and plea&s;ures of this world. "Take the mi&s;er (&s;ays our philo&s;opher in his ora|tion) from the earth, if it be po&s;&s;ible di&s;engage him &mdash;he who&s;e nightly re&s;t has been long broken by the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle foot of it, u&s;ele&s;s perhaps to him; and remove him to the planet Mars, one of the lea&s;t

<P>Once more&mdash;the &s;tudy of a&s;tronomy has the mo&s;t friendly influence upon morals, and religion. "Yes," (&s;ays our philo&s;opher in another part of his ora|tion) "the direct tendency of this &s;cience is to dilate the heart with univer&s;al benevolence, and to enlarge its views. It flatters no princely vice, nor national depravity. It encourages not the libertine by relaxing any of the precepts of morality, nor does it attempt to undermine the foundations of religion. It denies none of tho&s;e attributes, which the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of mankind have in all ages a&s;cribed to the Deity. Nor does it degrade the human mind from that dignity which is ever nece&s;&s;ary to make it contemplate <HI>it&s;elf</HI> with complacency. None of the&s;e things does a&s;tronomy pretend to, and if the&s;e things merit the name of philo&s;ophy, and the encouragement of a people, then let &s;ceptici&s;m flouri&s;h, and a&s;tronomy lie neglected.&mdash;Let the names of Barkley and Hume

Had the u&s;ual forms of a public education in the United States been impo&s;ed upon him; in&s;tead of revolving through life in a plane|tary orbit, he would probably have con&s;umed the force of his genius by fluttering around the blaze of an even|ing taper.

As the &s;ource of the&s;e virtues, whether of a public or private nature, I &s;hall fir&s;t mention his exalted &s;en&s;e of moral obligation, founded upon the revelation of the perfec|tions of the Supreme Being. This appears from many pa&s;&s;ages in his oration, and from his private letters to his friends. In his oration we find the following pious &s;entiment. "Should it plea&s;e that Almighty Power who hath placed us in a world in which we are only permitted 'to look about us and to die,' to indulge us with exi&s;tence throughout that half of eternity which &s;till remains un&s;pent, and to conduct us through the &s;everal &s;tages of his works, <HI>here</HI> (meaning in the &s;tudy of a&s;tronomy) is ample provi&s;ion made for employing every faculty of the mind, even allowing its powers to be enlarged through an endle&s;s repetition of ages. Let us not complain of the vanity of this world, and that there is nothing in it capable of &s;atisfying us. Happy in tho&s;e wants&mdash;happy in tho&s;e de&s;ires, forever in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to be gratified&mdash;happy in a continual ap|proach to the Deity."</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="034495_0368_0FFE0473029817D0">"I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I am not one of tho&s;e &s;anguine &s;pirits who &s;eem to think that when the withered hand of death has drawn up the curtain of eternity, all di&s;tance between the creature and the Creator, and between finite and infinite, will be annihilated. Every enlargement of our faculties&mdash;every new happine&s;s conferred upon us, every &s;tep we advance towards the Divinity, will very probably render us more and more &s;en&s;ible of his inexhau&s;tible &s;tores of communicable bli&s;s, and of his inacce&s;&s;ible perfections."</P>
<P>There appears to be a natural connection between a knowledge of the works of nature and ju&s;t ideas of the divine perfections; and if philo&s;ophers have not in all ages been equally devout with our Pre&s;ident, it becomes us to acquire how far the beneficial influence of philo&s;ophy upon religion, may have been prevented by their minds being pre-occupied in early life with the fictions of ancient poets, and the vices of the hea|then gods. It remains yet to be determined, whether all the moral as well as natural attributes of the Deity may not be di&s;covered in the form, and oeconomy of the material world, and whether that righteou&s;ne&s;s which de&s;cended from heaven near eighteen hundred years ago, may not wait for philo&s;ophical truth to &s;pring up from the earth, in order by uniting with it, to com|mand univer&s;al belief and obedience. This opinion, as far as it relates to one of the moral attributes of the Deity, &s;eems to have been admitted by our philo&s;opher in the following elegant and pious extract from a letter
<PB N="363" REF="034495_0369_0FFE04748A846DB8">
to one of his friends "give me leave (&s;ays he) to men|tion two or three proofs of infinite goodne&s;s in the works of creation. The fir&s;t is, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing goodne&s;s in our&s;elves. Now it is incon&s;i&s;tent with all ju&s;t rea&s;on|ing to &s;uppo&s;e, that there is any thing good&punc; lovely or prai&s;e-worthy in us, which is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in an in|finitely higher degree by that Being who fir&s;t called us into exi&s;tence. In the next place I reckon the exqui&s;ite and innocent delight that many things around us are calculated to afford us. In this light the beauty and frag|rance of a &s;ingle ro&s;e is a better argument for divine goodne&s;s than a luxuriant field of wheat. For if we can &s;uppo&s;e that we were created by a malevolent Being with a de&s;ign to torment us for his amu&s;ement, he mu&s;t have furni&s;hed us with the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and either have made our condition tolerable, or not have left the means of quitting it at plea&s;ure, in our own power. Such being my opinions, you will not wonder at my fondne&s;s for what Mr. Addi&s;on calls 'the plea&s;ures of the imagination.' They are all to me, &s;o many demon&s;trations of infinite goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>If &s;uch be the pious fruits of an attentive examina|tion of the works of the Creator, cea&s;e ye mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel to defeat the de&s;ign of your benevolent labors, by interpo&s;ing the common &s;tudies of the &s;chools between our globe, and the minds of young people.

mineral productions of the earth, to in&s;truct them in the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the Creator, and let the effects of phy&s;ical evil upon general happine&s;s, vin|dicate the divine government, in permitting the exi&s;|tence of moral evil in our world. Thus the perver&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of man, may be made to unite with &s;torms and tempe&s;ts, in furni&s;hing proofs of the goodne&s;s of the Creator of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>But the religion of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e, was not de|rived wholly from his knowledge and admiration of the material world. He believed in the Chri&s;tian revelation. Of this, he gave many proofs, not only in the conformity of his life, to the precepts of the go&s;pel, but in his letters and conver&s;ation. I well recollect in &s;peaking to me of the truth and excel|lency of the Chri&s;tian religion, he mentioned as an evidence of its divine origin, that the miracles of our Saviour differed from all other miracles, in being entirely of a kind and benevolent nature. It is no &s;mall triumph to the friends of Revelation to ob&s;erve, in this age of infidelity, that our religion has been admitted and even defended by men of the mo&s;t ex|alted under&s;tanding, and of the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;oning powers.

With plea&s;ure have I looked beyond my pre&s;ent la|bors to a time, when his &s;ociety &s;hould con&s;titute one of the principal enjoyments of the evening of

my life.&mdash;But alas! that time, &s;o often anticipated, and &s;o delightful in pro&s;pect&mdash;will never&mdash;come</P>
<P>I hope it will not be thought that I tread too clo&s;ely upon his foot&s;teps, when I pre&s;ume to lift the latch of his door, and to exhibit him in the do|me&s;tic relations of a hu&s;band and father. It was the practice of the philo&s;ophers of former ages, to pa&s;s their lives in their clo&s;ets, and to maintain a formal and di&s;tant intercour&s;e with their families; but our philo&s;opher was a &s;tranger to pride and im|po&s;ture in every thing. His family con&s;tituted his chief &s;ociety, and the mo&s;t intimate circle of his friends. When the declining &s;tate of his health, rendered the &s;olitude of his &s;tudy, le&s;s agreeable than in former years, he pa&s;&s;ed whole evenings in reading or conver&s;ing, with his wife and daughters. Happy family! &s;o much and &s;o long ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a head! and happier &s;till, to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed di&s;po&s;itions and knowledge to di&s;cern and love his exalted cha|racter, and to enjoy his in&s;tructing conver&s;ation!&mdash; Thus Sir Thomas Moore lived with his accompli&s;hed wife and daughters;&mdash;Thus Cicero educated his be|loved Tullia; and in this way only, can the female &s;ex be elevated to that dignity, and u&s;efulne&s;s in &s;ociety, for which they were formed, and by which from their influence upon manners, a new aera would be created in the hi&s;tory of mankind.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e and manner of living, of our pre&s;ident, exhibited the ta&s;te of a philo&s;opher, the &s;implicity of a
<PB N="373" REF="034495_0379_0FFDC652050589A8">
republican, and the temper of a Chri&s;tian. He was independent, and contented with an e&s;tate, &s;mall in the e&s;timation of ambition and avarice, but amply &s;uited to all his wants and de&s;ires. He held the office of trea&s;urer of Penn&s;ylvania, by an annual and unanimous vote of the legi&s;lature, between the years 1777, and 1789. During this period, he declined purcha&s;ing the &s;malle&s;t portion of the public debt of the &s;tate, there|by manife&s;ting a delicacy of integrity, which is known and felt only by pure and elevated minds.</P>
<P>In the year 1792, he was per&s;uaded to accept of the office of Director of the mint of the United States. His want of health, obliged him to re&s;ign it in 1795. Here his conduct was likewi&s;e above &s;u&s;picion, for I have been informed by his colleague in office,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr Way.</NOTE> that in &s;everal in&s;tances, he paid for work done at the mint out of his &s;alary, where he thought the charges for it would be deemed extravagant by the United States.</P>
<P>His oeconomy extended to a wi&s;e and profitable u&s;e of his time. No man ever found him unemployed. As an apology for detaining a friend a few mi|nutes, while he arranged &s;ome papers he had been examining, he &s;aid, "that he had once thought health, the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing in the world, but that he now thought there was one thing of much greater value, and that was time." The propriety of this remark will appear when we con&s;ider, that Providence, &s;o li|beral in other gifts, be&s;tows this, in a &s;paring manner.

He never gives a &s;econd moment, until he has with|drawn the fir&s;t, and &s;till re&s;erves the third in his own hand.</P>
<P>The countenance of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e, was too re|markable to be unnoticed upon this occa&s;ion. It di&s;|played &s;uch a mixture of contemplation, benignity, and innocence, that it was ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h his per&s;on in the large&s;t company, by a previous knowledge of his character. His manners were civil, and engaging to &s;uch a degree, that he &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed an hour, even in a public hou&s;e, in travelling through our country with|out being followed by the good wi&s;hes of all who at|tended upon him. There was no affectation of &s;ingula|rity, in any thing he &s;aid or did: even his hand writing, in which this weakne&s;s &s;o frequently di&s;covers it&s;elf, was &s;imple and intelligible at fir&s;t &s;ight, to all who &s;aw it.</P>
<P>Here I expected to have fini&s;hed the detail of his vir|tues, but in the neighbourhood of that galaxy created by their connected lu&s;tre, I behold a virtue of ine&s;tim|able value, twinkling like a rare, and &s;olitary &s;tar. It is his &s;uperlative mode&s;ty. This heaven born virtue was &s;o con&s;picuous in every part of his conduct, that he appeared not &s;o much to conceal, as to be ignorant of his &s;uperiority as a philo&s;opher and a man, over the greate&s;t part of his fellow creatures.</P>
<P>In reviewing the intellectual endowments and moral excellency of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e, and our late intimate
<PB N="375" REF="034495_0381_0FFE04969AF67740">
connection with him, we are led to rejoice in being men.</P>
<P>We proceed now to the clo&s;ing &s;cenes of his life.</P>
<P>His con&s;titution was naturally feeble, but it was ren|dered &s;till more &s;o, by &s;edentary labor, and midnight &s;tudies. He was afflicted for many years with a weak brea&s;t, which, upon unu&s;ual exertions of body or mind, or &s;udden changes in the weather, became the &s;eat of a painful and harra&s;&s;ing di&s;order. This con&s;titutional infirmity was not without its u&s;es. It contributed much to the perfection of his virtue, by producing habitual patience and re&s;ignation to the will of heaven, and a con&s;tant eye to the hour of his di&s;&s;olution. It was a window through which he often looked with plea&s;ure towards a place of exi&s;|tence where from the encrea&s;e and perfection of his intuitive faculties, he would probably acquire more knowledge in an hour, than he had acquired in his whole life, by the &s;low operations of rea&s;on; and where, from the greater magnitude and extent of the the objects of his contemplation, his native globe, would appear like his cradle, and all the events of time, like the amu&s;ements of his infant years.</P>
<P>On the 26th of June, of the pre&s;ent year, the long expected me&s;&s;enger of death, di&s;clo&s;ed his com|mi&s;&s;ion. In his la&s;t illne&s;s, which was acute, and &s;hort, he retained the u&s;ual patience and benevo|lence of his temper. Upon being told that &s;ome of
<PB N="376" REF="034495_0382_0FFE049960EE9E48">
his friends had called at his door to enquire how he was; he a&s;ked why they were not invited into his chamber to &s;ee him. "Becau&s;e (&s;aid his wife) you are too weak to &s;peak to them." "Yes (&s;aid he) that is true, but I could &s;till have &s;queezed their hands."&mdash;Thus with a heart overflowing with love to his family, friends, country, and to the whole world, he peacefully re&s;igned his &s;pirit into the hands of his God. Let the day of his death be recorded in the annals of our &s;ociety, and let its annual return be marked by &s;ome public act, which &s;hall characteri&s;e his &s;ervices and our grief, and thereby animate us and our &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to imitate his illu&s;trious example!</P>
<P>It has been the fa&s;hion of late years, to &s;ay of per|&s;ons who had been di&s;tingui&s;hed in life, when they left the world in a &s;tate of indifference to every thing, and believing, and hoping in nothing, that they died like philo&s;ophers. Very different was the latter end of our excellent pre&s;ident. He died like a chri&s;tian, in|tere&s;ted in the welfare of all around him&mdash;believing in the re&s;urrection, and the life to come, and hoping for happine&s;s from every attribute of the Deity.</P>
<P>Agreeably to his reque&s;t, his body was interred in his ob&s;ervatory near his dwelling hou&s;e, in the pre&s;ence of a numerous concour&s;e of his fellow-citi|zens. It was natural for him in the near pro&s;pect of appearing in the pre&s;ence of his Maker, to feel an
<PB N="377" REF="034495_0383_0FFE049E997DE4E8">
attachment to that &s;pot in which he had cultivated a knowledge of his perfections, and held communion with him through the medium of his works. Here|after it &s;hall become one of the objects of curio&s;ity in our city. Thither &s;hall the philo&s;ophers of future ages re&s;ort to do homage to his tomb, and children yet unborn, &s;hall point to the dome which covers it, and exultingly &s;ay, "there lies our Rittenhou&s;e."</P>
<P>Let us my re&s;pected colleagues, repair for a few minutes to that awful &s;pot.&mdash;In entering it&mdash;we behold the tele&s;cope, dear in&s;trument of his di&s;coveries, turn|ed upon its axis, and pointed to the earth, which has clo&s;ed its ma&s;ter's eyes.&mdash;How artle&s;s&mdash;the in&s;cripti|on upon his tomb&s;tone!&mdash;It contains nothing but his name, and the &s;imple record of the days and years of his birth and death.&mdash;Very different would have been the monument of his worth and fame, had not the gratitude and affection of his friends been controuled by his dying reque&s;t. His head would have reclined in marble, upon the lap of religion. At his feet, &s;ci|ence would have &s;at&mdash;bathed in tears; while the ge|nius of republican liberty, in the figure of a venerable hermit, bending over his grave, would have deplored the lo&s;s of his favourite &s;on.&mdash;Alas!&mdash;too&mdash;too &s;oon has our beloved pre&s;ident been torn from the chair of our &s;ociety!&mdash;Too &s;oon has he laid a&s;ide his robes of office, and cea&s;ed to mini&s;ter for us day and night at the altar of &s;cience!&mdash;Ah!&mdash;who now will elevate his tele&s;cope, and again direct it towards yonder heavens?
<PB N="378" REF="034495_0384_0FFE04A0217B9438">
Who now will ob&s;erve the tran&s;it of the planets? Who now will awaken our nation to view the trackle&s;s and &s;tupendous comet? Who now will mea&s;ure the cour&s;es of our rivers, in order to convey their &s;treams into our city, for the purpo&s;es of health and com|merce?&mdash;Nature is dumb;&mdash;for the voice of her chief interpreter is hu&s;hed in death.&mdash;In this hour of our bereavement, to whom &s;hall we look?&mdash;but to THEE, FATHER of life and light:&mdash;thou author of great and good gifts to man. O! let not thy Sun, thy Moon, and thy Stars now &s;hine unob&s;erved among us! may the genius of our departed pre&s;ident, like the man|tle of thy prophet of old, de&s;cend upon &s;ome member of our &s;ociety, who &s;hall, as he did, explain to us the my&s;teries of thy works, and lead us &s;tep by &s;tep, to THYSELF, the great overflowing fountain of wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and mercy, to the children of men!</P>
