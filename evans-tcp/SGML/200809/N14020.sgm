<HEAD>THE <HI>Novelty</HI> of <HI>Novelties</HI> examined, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Sermon now before us is certainly a paragon of the kind. Its equal, in all re&s;pects, has perhaps never yet appeared in any language &s;ince that unhappy epocha, the confu&s;ion of tongues.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ince we are by divine authority commanded to prove all things, before we venture to imbibe any of tho&s;e drops the author propo&s;es to impart, we &s;hall not &s;cruple to bring his water to the criterion of truth, nor make any apology for &s;eriou&s;ly trying it by the infallible &s;tandard of verity, the Word of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>WE have been taught not to believe every &s;pirit. This watch-word puts us on our guard, and makes us cautious, le&s;t the potion offered, not flowing from the ocean of love, nor &s;pringing from the fountain of life, but rather from &s;ome &s;tygian lake, &s;hould deceive us; and, in&s;tead of refre&s;hing our &s;ouls, or exhilerating our &s;pirits, by its pe&s;tiferous qua|lity infect our con&s;titutions, if not poi&s;on us to death!</P>
<P>UPON peru&s;al, this di&s;cour&s;e is found to be a compo&s;ition of <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> and <HI>Divinity.</HI> There are al&s;o a few &s;ketches of <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> and <HI>Logic</HI> intermixed. The whole being embelli&s;hed with many &s;ublime phra&s;es, and inforced with the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>a&s;&s;urance.</HI> It is the two principal parts that &s;hall be now taken into con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>AFTER a &s;hort introduction, and brief elucidation of the general plan, we are pre&s;ented with a conci&s;e hi&s;tory of the old creation. The narration is truly curious; and the project not a little amu&s;ing. Every page reflects the author in a &s;trong light, and &s;hews him to be a per&s;on of extraordinary invention. But, yet, alas! there is one material blemi&s;h,
<PB N="4" REF="017740_0004_0FA26A09520772B0">
which, as a muddy &s;tream, runs quite through his perform|ance. This &s;ingle flaw, like a dead fly, corrupts the whole box of ointment, and cau&s;es it to emit a nau&s;eous &s;avour. The misfortune is, it does not in &s;everal particulars at all accord with the three fir&s;t chapters of Gene&s;is. So that it is plain either the ancient Prophet, or the modern Preacher, erred in vi&s;ion, and &s;tumbled in judgment, when de&s;cribing this &s;tupendous production of Almighty Power.</P>
<P>MOSES, indeed, gives us no account of either the creation or fall of angels. Nor has any other in&s;pired writer left a word on record relating to their formation. But Mr. Win|che&s;ter has &s;upplied this defect. He &s;ays, <Q>they were created out of nature, which was at fir&s;t pure, tran&s;parent, hea|venly, &s;ub&s;tantiality,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIS, &s;urely, is a late revelation, and newly come out of the mint. But whether it may be allowed to pa&s;s as current coin, or ought to be condemned as a counterfeit, &s;hall be left to more &s;kilful judges to determine. However, this may be affirmed, it needs an expo&s;itor of profound erudition, being much harder to under&s;tand than the darke&s;t vi&s;ion or mo&s;t ab|&s;tru&s;e my&s;tery contained even in the apocalyp&s;e of St. John. But let us attend to the event.</P>
<P>WE are told in the &s;ame page, <Q>That one of the&s;e angels, <HI>Lucifer</HI> by name, &s;eeking to enter into the fir&s;t properties of life, &amp;c. fell, with all his legions (who in number were one third of the cele&s;tial ho&s;t) into the dark center of na|ture. And thus we account for the earth being without form, and void, and darkne&s;s covering the deep.</Q></P>
<P>Now MOSES &s;eems to intimate, that this formle&s;s ma&s;s was the original &s;ub&s;tance of the afterward vi&s;ible world. That the &s;ucceeding operations of Omnipotence were only to re|duce this primogenious matter into ju&s;t order and regularity. And that, after this work was compleated, Infinite Wi&s;dom, pa&s;&s;ing his verdict upon the whole amazing &s;y&s;tem, pronounced it good, yea, very good. But, if the&s;e apo&s;tate &s;pirits had gained &s;o early a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of nature, while as yet it remain|ed but a rude and indige&s;ted chaos, it &s;eems &s;trange that any good &s;hould ever come out of &s;uch a Nazareth! An Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us, that the rebel angels were ca&s;t down to hell. And according to our author, this horrible pit was nothing el&s;e but
<PB N="5" REF="017740_0005_0FA26A0964C807E8">
the dark center of nature. If &s;o, we might have expected to hear that the world, and all it contained, was bad, yea, very bad, from its fir&s;t appearance, &s;eeing it was made out of &s;uch infernal particles, &s;uch luciferized ingredients. Upon this hypothe&s;is, he might have &s;pared all his labour to prove a ge|neral redemption from hell. For, in reality, there neither is now, nor ever was &s;uch a place &s;ince man was brought into exi&s;tence. No! no! The di&s;mal tartarean pri&s;on was illumi|nated on the fir&s;t day of the creation, and by the &s;eventh to|tally demoli&s;hed; or rather turned into a &s;plendid and mag|nificent palace. How much to be regretted is it, that tho&s;e malicious trouble&s;ome &s;pirits were not converted at the &s;ame time! e&s;pecially as it is to be their happy lot at la&s;t, accord|ing to Mr. Winche&s;ter's doctrine! For 'tis plain they have not only entered into our world &s;ince it was fir&s;t made, but into the very hearts of all its inhabitants; and are evidently, this day, driving multitudes of them, like the &s;wine in the go&s;pel, down the &s;teep and &s;lippery declivities of vanity and delu&s;ion, into the great &s;ea of eternal wrath, into the bottom|le&s;s gulf of everla&s;ting perdition! And they are likely,&mdash;likely did I &s;ay? nay, without repentance, they will a&s;&s;uredly peri&s;h in the great waters! But as this world, and all its inhabitants, were created without fault, and made perfect in their &s;everal kinds, we are fully per&s;uaded that Satan had no po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of nor dominion over any of them, until he had &s;educed our <HI>Fir&s;t Parents</HI> into di&s;obedience, and brought them into the &s;ame condemnation with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IN the book of Gene&s;is we are informed, that the ter|re&s;trial Paradi&s;e was &s;ituated in and extended no farther than one particular &s;pot, viz. the ea&s;t of Eden. But in the <HI>Sermon</HI> we are certified, that this Paradi&s;e covered <Q>the whole earth; hid the cur&s;e, which was already broke out in it; and brought forth its proper fruit. But while the good and evil were at &s;trife, the <HI>Divine Artificer</HI> joining his power to the fir&s;t property of the de&s;ire, it became an Almighty <HI>Fiat,</HI> which prevented any more wrath and darkne&s;s to be introduced into nature. And to effect this benign and &s;alutary tran&s;mutation, <HI>the Spirit of God</HI> brooding on the face of the deep, bapti&s;ed the &s;ame with <HI>light</HI>; that the heavenly properties might be awakened, or &s;tir|red up,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="017740_0006_0FA26A0A46F232C0">IT &s;eems, by this account, the whole creation (the inani|mate parts not excepted) was conceived in iniquity, born in &s;in, and under a horrible malediction from the very womb! So that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of dipping it into &s;ome ocean of light (for no river would be &s;ufficient) that by this cele&s;tial immer&s;ion it might be wa&s;hed of its native filth, and puri|fied from its original pollution. And which is yet more, that the Angels might be prevented for the future from in|troducing any more <HI>wrath</HI> or <HI>darkne&s;s</HI> into nature.</P>
<P>How well would it be for the chri&s;tian world, if their water-bapti&s;m had &s;uch beneficial effects on the &s;ubjects of that holy ordinance! But it is not, alas! it is not &s;o. Yet, if Mo&s;es may be depended on, this de&s;ign proved abortive, and was &s;oon fru&s;trated. For Adam and Eve were not yet formed. And after this the &s;erpent prevailed with them to eat the forbidden fruit, and thereby introduced, if po&s;&s;ible, a &s;till greater cloud of wrath and darkne&s;s into nature. For hereupon we find them both turned out of the happy <HI>garden,</HI> and the very ground cur&s;ed for their &s;akes. Nor has it to this day been delivered from that bondage of corruption in which it was then involved.</P>
<P>So that this is altogether a very gloomy repre&s;entation of the affair. But what the author means by the&s;e phra&s;es, viz. The fir&s;t property of the de&s;ire; This congealing the whole into &s;olid bodies, &amp;c. is a midnight &s;hade too thick for my penetration. 'Tis all palpable ob&s;curity! gro&s;s darkne&s;s, without a ray of light! Such unintelligible jargon may &s;erve to amu&s;e the vulgar, and &s;et the populace a &s;taring, who are mo&s;tly fond of what they cannot under&s;tand, but can afford no &s;atisfaction to people of di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>MOSES tells us, in his plain way, That <HI>God</HI> formed man out of the <HI>du&s;t,</HI> and breathed into his no&s;trils the breath of life. By this account we naturally conclude, that the corpo|real part of the human frame was produced out of the earth, and the &s;oul immediately created out of no pre-exi&s;tent mat|ter, and by the <HI>divine afflation</HI> infu&s;ed and united to the body. But Mr. Winche&s;ter &s;ays, <Q>the whole man was form|ed out of the three principles, viz. <HI>fire, water,</HI> and the prin|ciple called the third, viz. of this lower world, or nature.</Q></P>
<P>BUT what this third principle was we are not told. Pro|bably
<PB N="7" REF="017740_0007_0FA26A0ADD219C70">
it was &s;ome occult and namele&s;s element! Nor is it ea&s;y to conjecture what it might be, unle&s;s it was that &s;trange, complex gho&s;t, the <HI>wrath</HI> and <HI>darkne&s;s</HI> which Lucifer had irri|tated and &s;tirred up in nature. But if &s;o, &s;urely man was not created in the image of <HI>God,</HI> but rather in the image of the Devil. No wonder then that he &s;o readily hearkened to that degraded &s;eraphim.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the &s;acred hi&s;tory, we u&s;ed to conceive that Adam was no more than a man when fir&s;t brought into being. That he was in a &s;olitary &s;tate. And that the woman was formed &s;ome time afterwards. And that to this end <HI>God</HI> cau&s;ed a deep &s;leep to fall upon Adam, during which he took a rib out of his body, of which he made a creature of &s;omewhat different &s;hape and quality, who was appointed to be the future companion of his life. But in the <HI>Sermon</HI> we are given to under&s;tand, that Adam was primarily of the commune of two genders: that is, he was <Q>both male and female at once.</Q> <HI>Mon&s;trum horrendum!</HI> What an odd idea of our venerable progenitor does this de&s;cription convey! *******! Mr. Winche&s;ter tells us, <Q>that Adam was lulled a&s;leep by the power of lu&s;t, which &s;hews his defection was begun, to prevent the completion of which, <HI>Jehovah</HI> &s;epa|rated the woman from him.</Q> But Mo&s;es &s;hews us very clearly that Eve began to lu&s;t in the fir&s;t place, and at the &s;erpent's in&s;tigation &s;wallowed the interdicted <HI>bait</HI>; and then allured her hu&s;band into the &s;ame tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Whereas, agreeable to the Sermon, Adam fell a lu&s;ting, and was led a&s;tray by the force of inherent concupi&s;cence, before the woman had any apparent exi&s;tence; unle&s;s he will &s;ay the female lu&s;ted in him before her &s;eparation, which would not be good logic, except &s;he was that third principle of which he &s;o often &s;peaks, and to which he attributes &s;ome unac|countable wonders.</P>
<P>THE forbidden tree, by the &s;cripture, appears to have been planted at the &s;ame time with the re&s;t, and to have been placed in the mid&s;t of the famous garden. But the Sermon might induce us to &s;uppo&s;e, that it &s;prung up by &s;ome &s;pon|taneous power of vegetation. Where this pernicious tree &s;tood is not told us; but it looks as if it germinated in Adam's fle&s;h, and budded, and flowered, and fructified, and brought forth its mortiferous fruit in the man's own brea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017740_0008_0FA26A0BB3A659E0">IF that was the ca&s;e, pray how came the woman to have acce&s;s to its fatal branches? How came &s;he to behold the ap|ples? For it &s;eems they were plea&s;ant to her eyes. This is, perhaps, an harder que&s;tion than any the Queen of Sheba propo&s;ed to King Solomon, when &s;he paid him that celebrated vi&s;it. Though the royal Philo&s;opher readily an&s;wered all the queries &s;he offered, yet in my opinion this one would have brought him to his <HI>ne plus ultra,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his peerle&s;s wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>THE in&s;pired writer mentions no con&s;ort that Adam ever had, but one, and calls them, the man and his wife. But our author certifies, that he was fir&s;t <Q>joined to the pure vir|gin of <HI>divine wi&s;dom,</HI> who was the wife of his youth.</Q> In pur&s;uance of this, our mother Eve mu&s;t have been his &s;e|cond bride. What pity it is, that he has not completed this part of his hi&s;tory! Why has he not told us what number of children Adam had by this miraculous woman? How many of each &s;ex were born to them, as pledges of their conjugal endearment? And what became of the whole progeny at la&s;t? &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. For it is likely they all died, or were &s;ome how extinct, before Mo&s;es wrote the book of Gene&s;is. And perhaps he never heard that there had been &s;uch a gene|ration upon the earth.</P>
<P><HI>Sed pudet hoec opprobria!</HI> I grow weary of animadverting on &s;uch my&s;tick whim&s;ies. Great part of his hi&s;tory is quite fabulous; and &s;ome of it perfect puerility. It puts me in mind of Ovid's Metamorpho&s;es; though the mythology of the Pagan Poet is much more rational than that of this Chri&s;tian Preacher. Such enthu&s;ia&s;tic reveries, &s;uch prodigi|ous blunders, and mi&s;con&s;tructions, and ab&s;urdities, and con|tradictions, are too tedious for patience it&s;elf to dwell upon. Indeed, they expo&s;e them&s;elves; and to an intelligent reader require no confutation. We &s;hall therefore di&s;mi&s;s the hi&s;to|rical; and proceed to con&s;ider the doctrinal part of this nota|ble di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>UPON in&s;pection, we find the latter affords no better en|tertainment than the former. The author's &s;cheme of di|vinity differs as far fron the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, as his account of the creation does from the hi&s;tory of Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>THE profe&s;&s;ed &s;cope of our author is, to prove an univer&s;al
<PB N="9" REF="017740_0009_0FA26A0C54DE6458">
redemption, or the final re&s;toration of all things. So that not only the whole human race, but even the fallen angels likewi&s;e (though he did not think proper to a&s;&s;ert it, perhaps out of mode&s;ty) &s;hall, after certain revolutions of time, be fully manumitted from their infernal confinement, and be enfranchi&s;ed into all the immunities of the ble&s;&s;ed. This is his mo&s;t delightful theme. This the minion of his affection. This the favourite, the darling, on which he doats. But how he defends it &s;hall be our pre&s;ent enquiry.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ermon it is ob&s;erved, that <Q>the glorious <HI>Deity</HI> can have but one will toward all his creatures, which always continues the &s;ame, and alters not through the fall of any of them.</Q> But the go&s;pel very po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts the con|trary. Therein we are a&s;&s;ured, that it is not the will of God that &s;ome per&s;ons &s;hould peri&s;h in any &s;en&s;e of the word, and that he is willing to make his power known in the de&s;truction of others.</P>
<P>That there is, that there can be but one power of volition in the <HI>Supreme Being,</HI> is readily granted; but that this power cannot, or that it does not act variou&s;ly, according to the &s;e|veral objects with whom it is concerned, is utterly denied. For was that the ca&s;e, all rational creatures mu&s;t of con&s;e|quence be equally happy, or equally mi&s;erable, both during time and throughout eternity. But we daily &s;ee a very wide difference in the circum&s;tances of nations and countries, and families, as well as of individuals in this world. And we are abundantly certified in the go&s;pel, that their &s;tations hereafter, according to their &s;everal characters, will vary ju&s;t as much as the joys of <HI>Heaven</HI> and the torments of <HI>Hell</HI> are contrary one to the other. The ble&s;&s;ed <HI>God,</HI> without any doubt, wills the felicity of <HI>all</HI> men, on condition of their per&s;evering obedi|ence to his injunctions, and con&s;tant compliance with his com|mands. He will a&s;&s;uredly reward his faithful &s;ervants with peculiar tokens of his approbation, and he will as certainly make all irreclaimable offenders &s;en&s;ible of his di&s;plea&s;ure, by puni&s;hing them in a ju&s;t proportion to the &s;everal aggravations of their crimes. The &s;ame munificent hand that imparts a royal diadem to one per&s;on, may &s;mite another to death. This &s;imilitude is pregnant to the purpo&s;e, and needs no illu|&s;tration. Nor do the&s;e di&s;criminating acts of retribution
<PB N="10" REF="017740_0010_0FA26A0F20447B98">
cau&s;e the lead variation in the righteous <HI>Judge.</HI> No, he is the very &s;ame &s;till, without any &s;hadow of turning. The change is only in his creatures. Their perdition is not of <HI>God.</HI> Their rueful cata&s;trophe is the effect of their wilful rebellion. Their eternal damnation is their own voluntary option, and the ju&s;t wages of their conduct. So that this a&s;&s;ertion of Mr. Winche&s;ter's is either nothing to his purpo&s;e, or el&s;e a very dangerous mi&s;take. If he means that the <HI>Di|vine Will,</HI> con&s;idered as an attribute, is but one, it can have no relation to his doctrine, and is no more to his purpo&s;e, than if he had emphatically declared <HI>there is but one God.</HI>&mdash; But if he means that this <HI>Will</HI> does never act in a different manner, as afore&s;aid, it contradicts the whole tenor of the <HI>Bible,</HI> and is as oppo&s;ite to the go&s;pel revelation, as the mo&s;t arrant fal&s;hood is to the plaine&s;t truth that was ever publi&s;hed to the world.</P>
<P>WE are told in the &s;ame page, That <Q><HI>fury, wrath,</HI> or <HI>anger,</HI> can never dwell in the fountain of <HI>love.</HI></Q>&mdash;Yet every one that reads the holy Scriptures mu&s;t &s;urely know, that all the&s;e are very frequently attributed to the <HI>Supreme Being.</HI> We find him threatening the wicked, if they repent not, that his <HI>fury</HI> &s;hall come upon them as an unquenchable <HI>fire</HI>; that his anger is poured out as an overwhelming inun|dation, we are often a&s;&s;ured; and that his wrath is revealed from heaven again&s;t all the ungodly without di&s;tinction, is a &s;olemn declaration recorded in the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> it&s;elf. But what &s;ignifies quoting particular pa&s;&s;ages in confirmation of this point. It &s;hines con&s;picuou&s;ly through the whole book, and to prove it is as unnece&s;&s;ary, as lighting a taper to &s;hew the &s;un at noon-day. It is true, fury in <HI>God</HI> is not a turbulent pa&s;&s;ion, as it is in fallen creatures, and is only a&s;cribed to him by a figure. Yet it &s;hews us, that he will deal with in|corrigible &s;inners as the mo&s;t choleric and incen&s;ed Potentate would with the vile&s;t of traitors; <HI>i. e.</HI> condemn them accord|ing to law, and order their execution without the lea&s;t in|dulgence or mitigation of the &s;entence. The anger of the Almighty is no anxious commotion or perturbation of mind. No! It is nothing but the &s;edate, deliberate, undi&s;turbed ac|compli&s;hment of his <HI>Word.</HI> Is it therefore the le&s;s to be dread|ed? Not at all. Nay, this renders it infinitely more formi|dable
<PB N="11" REF="017740_0011_0FA26A1094982010">
than the united re&s;entment of all creatures together! The wrath of <HI>God,</HI> being the cool, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate performance of his immutable decrees, is unutterably fearful! is incon|ceivably terrible! and to deny that fury, in any &s;en&s;e, dwells in the <HI>Deity,</HI> is a contradiction to his revealed will, and a di&s;honour to his <HI>holy name.</HI></P>
<P>WAS &s;ome favourite Mini&s;ter of State not only to proclaim it with his tongue, but publi&s;h in print, that his royal ma&s;ter was of &s;o tender a complexion, and &s;o eminent for clemency, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to provoke him to wrath, or to rou&s;e his indignation, in&s;omuch that the mo&s;t in&s;olent and flagitious malefactor had nothing to fear from him: His &s;ubjects might renounce their allegiance, take up the arms of rebellion, and even attempt to dethrone their lawful Sovereign, and yet not as much as doubt of e&s;caping with impunity. For he never did, nor ever would condemn any man to death, however criminal his deportment might be. Who &s;ees not that every per&s;on endued with common &s;en&s;e mu&s;t either believe this to be a fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ion ca&s;t upon the King, a lying report invent|ed to &s;erve &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter end of this haughty and malignant Courtier, or that the Monarch was altogether unfit to fill a throne, and &s;hamefully unqualified to &s;way the &s;ceptre of Maje&s;ty? The application is ea&s;y.

And what is the native tendency of &s;uch a doctrine? Is it not directly calcu|lated to lull wretched mortals into the deepe&s;t &s;lumbers of carnal &s;ecurity? To make them believe that God has little or no regard for the honor of his government, and will never ari&s;e to a&s;&s;ert his dominion, vindicate the equity of his law, or maintain his own authority? In&s;tead of a curb to re&s;train their vicious propen&s;ities, will it not &s;erve as a &s;harp pointed &s;pur, exciting them to run precipitately, and without controul, into all the crooked paths of licentiou&s;ne&s;s? To encourage obdurate wretches, like tho&s;e complained of by the Prophet, <Q>to turn (notwith&s;tanding all amicable and compa&s;&s;ionate attempts to reclaim them) every one to his own way, as the hor&s;e ru&s;hes into the battle?</Q></P>

<P>CONCERNING Adam's probation, we are notified, <Q>that his trial was not arbitrarily impo&s;ed upon him by <HI>God,</HI> neither was the tree of knowledge planted in the garden on purpo&s;e to tempt him, as is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed.</Q> But if &s;o, may it not be enquired, what this &s;trange <HI>tree</HI> was planted at all for? What purpo&s;e could it an&s;wer? Adam, we read, was or|dered not to eat of it on pain of <HI>death.</HI> And pray what could be the de&s;ign of this prohibition, unle&s;s it was to tempt him, or to try his obedience, which is but the &s;ame thing? The au|thor
<PB N="13" REF="017740_0013_0FA26A1259D44630">
allows that Adam was in a &s;tate of trial. But what was there to try him by, if this tree be excluded from that de&s;ign? We read of no other injunction laid upon him, but a per|petual ab&s;tinence from the fruit thereof. It follows, therefore, that it was appointed for no other end but to tempt, or prove, or try him, call it which you will. And it is al&s;o manife&s;t that his trial was impo&s;ed upon him arbitrarily by <HI>God,</HI> or as an ab&s;olute Sovereign, who is re&s;pon&s;ible to none of his crea|tures, nor under any obligation to give an account of his matters to men or angels. <Q>He doth according to his will, in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth.</Q></P>
<P>GOD indeed tempts none of us to evil: Yet he may, and often does do &s;o for our good. It would have been infinitely to the advantage of our fir&s;t parents, had they &s;uffered this temptation without erring as they did. They would doubt|le&s;s, in due time, have been confirmed in their original recti|tude. They would very probably have received &s;ignal to|kens, &s;ome peculiar evidences of their Maker's regard. But we may be &s;ure they would have had the ravi&s;hing con&s;ola|tion of tran&s;mitting righteou&s;ne&s;s, and purity, and life, and con&s;ummate felicity to all their yet unborn po&s;terity. So that it was evidently an act of perfect goodne&s;s, and conde&s;cend|ing favour in <HI>God,</HI> to vouch&s;afe them &s;uch a favourable op|portunity of advancing their own happine&s;s, and that of their offspring to all &s;ucceeding generations. To be brief This po&s;ition of Mr. Winche&s;ter's cannot be found in the catalogue of orthodox doctrines. It does not harmonize with divine revelation. It does not at all corre&s;pond with the go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Therein we are a&s;&s;ured, that it was by one man's di&s;obedience many, <HI>i. e.</HI> all his po&s;terity, were made &s;in|ners. And who was this man but Adam? He was con&s;titut|ed our federal head, or repre&s;entative in the fir&s;t covenant. And as he broke it, his &s;in is very ju&s;tly imputed unto us. So that in Adam all die. But we are told of no &s;in he committed &s;ave only this one, his eating the forbidden fruit. Which proves to a demon&s;tration, that the afore&s;aid <HI>tree</HI> was actually planted in the garden to tempt, or try him, as was already ob&s;erved. What his de&s;ign, in denying the arbitrary impo&s;i|tion of Adam's trial, is difficult to conceive; unle&s;s this en|gine
<PB N="14" REF="017740_0014_0FA26A1322B07E40">
was contrived to batter down the precious doctrine of <HI>God</HI>'s &s;upreme Sovereignty. For Adam, &s;urely, might have been tried with a flower, or herb, or any other tree, had it been the good plea&s;ure of his Maker to have ordered it &s;o. The Council of the mo&s;t high &s;hall &s;tand, whatever cavils wretched mortals may rai&s;e again&s;t him, or his di&s;pen&s;ations. But according to this Sermon, Adam was tried, and yet not tried. He was tempted, and not tempted. He fell, yet there was nothing to hold him up, nor any thing to throw him down. Neither good nor evil &s;pirit had the lea&s;t hand in the tragedy. Into what mon&s;trous incon&s;i&s;tencies! into what &s;tu|pid rhap&s;odies will men run, when once they begin to &s;werve from the truth, and are turned unto <HI>Fables</HI>!</P>
<P>THE author affirms, that the <Q>promi&s;e in his text was no &s;ooner revealed to the parents of mankind, but it immedi|ately took effect. The &s;eed of the woman was in&s;tantane|ou&s;ly planted in their brea&s;ts as a &s;park of the <HI>Divine Light,</HI> from which moment <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s incarnation and man's re|&s;toration was begun. That the &s;ame <HI>&s;eed</HI> is derived unto and dwells in all their po&s;terity, as an <HI>in&s;poken &s;eed</HI> of the woman. And that it is of this immortal <HI>&s;eed</HI> that we mu&s;t be born again, in order to our entering the Kingdom of <HI>Heaven.</HI></Q> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. That this promi&s;e took a &s;alutary effect on both Adam and Eve, &s;ome time after its promulga|tion, is indeed commonly &s;uppo&s;ed. Yet 'tis at mo&s;t but a probable conjecture. It is not in any man's power to prove that it did &s;o. How then could he a&s;&s;ert it with &s;uch a ple|rophory of a&s;&s;urance? But it &s;eems Mr. <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> thought &s;o, and his opinion is &s;ufficient authority to ratify and e&s;tabli&s;h any article whatever.</P>
<P>BUT that this divine <HI>&s;eed</HI> is propagated by ordinary gene|ration to all, or to any of their po&s;terity, doth not yet appear. Nay, it is as contrary to the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the rotund apex of a mu&s;hroom is to the blooming foliage of a tulip. The Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us, that in human fle&s;h, as far as unrege|nerated, there "dwells no good thing." That while uncon|verted, all men are without <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> And that not <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> but <HI>Satan,</HI> works in the children of di&s;obedience, &amp;c. Now how this can be con&s;onant to the inherency of that feed, which he declares is really <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, the reader is left to judge.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="017740_0015_0FA26A1430C92E78">IN confirmation of this &s;trange doctrine, Mr. <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> quotes two texts of Scripture, viz. St. John, i. 9. and I. John, iv. 3. As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e citations, the Evan|geli&s;t's de&s;ign in that whole chapter was to prove our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s <HI>Divinity,</HI> which was even then &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by one <HI>Cerinthus,</HI> and his followers, who maintained that he was no more than a meer man. And this he does by many nervous and irrefragable arguments, among which this is not the lea&s;t, that our <HI>Lord</HI> was in reality no le&s;s a <HI>per&s;on</HI> than the <HI>Great Au|tophoos,</HI> or true <HI>Light,</HI> which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. That is, he is the <HI>Creator</HI> as well as Re|deemer of mankind. The almighty <HI>author</HI> of our under&s;tand|ing, and rea&s;on, and con&s;cicence, and every other faculty that human nature is endowed with, and by which we are dignified, and di&s;tingui&s;hed from the bea&s;ts of the field, &amp;c. Although he is the <HI>light</HI> only of the <HI>regenerate,</HI> by &s;piritual illumination.</P>
<P>As to the other text, the Apo&s;tle is evidently proving our <HI>Lord</HI>'s humanity again&s;t one <HI>Cerdon</HI> and his adherents, who denied his <HI>humanity:</HI> Contending that he only appeared in the &s;hape of a man, and a&s;&s;umed but the &s;hadow of a body. Wherefore St. John declares that &s;uch teachers, who with|&s;tood the doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s actual incarnation, or real a&s;|&s;umption of our nature, were not of <HI>God, i. e.</HI> were not &s;ent by his authority to preach the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> but were in truth the in&s;truments of <HI>Antichri&s;t.</HI> The&s;e &s;criptures, therefore, are no more to his purpo&s;e, than if he had quoted the two fir&s;t chap|ters of the fir&s;t book of <HI>Chronicles</HI> to prove that <HI>George</HI> the third was or is the rightful King of <HI>China</HI> or <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>THAT our Lord comes into the &s;ouls of all true believers, and dwells in their hearts by his &s;pirit, is very readily grant|ed. He is in them the hope of <HI>glory.</HI> But that he is even in their fle&s;h, &s;o that it may be called his incarnation, is utterly di&s;owned. How much le&s;s is he in all mankind in that, or any other proper acceptation of the word! For were it &s;o, there would be ju&s;t as many incarnate <HI>Deities</HI> as there ever were or &s;hall be men and women in the world. Shocking! to avow that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is incarnatively dwelling in every di&s;&s;o|lute profligate, in every abandoned reprobate! what epithet does this de&s;erve! what appellation &s;hall be given it! name|le&s;s may it remain!</P>

<P>IT is true, the que&s;tion that occa&s;ioned this di&s;cour&s;e was propo&s;ed by the Phari&s;ees. But that our Lord directed his an&s;wer to them is not &s;o certain.&mdash;It &s;eems more likely that our Saviour, turning or pointing to his Di&s;ciples, addre&s;&s;ed this in&s;truction unto them, in whom, no doubt, his kingdom of grace was erected.&mdash;Or if he &s;poke to tho&s;e wicked men, he could mean no more than that their long expected Me&s;&s;iah was really come, being no other but him&s;elf, who was now in their country, and pre&s;ent among them, cau&s;ing the joyful &s;ound of his go&s;pel, that melody of Zion, to ring in their ears. So that it was in vain to look any farther, for &s;alvation was not to be found in any other. And that our <HI>Lord</HI> could not intend to intimate that either the grace, or &s;pirit, or &s;eed of <HI>God,</HI> was in them, is evident. For at another time, he told the &s;ame kind of people, and perhaps the &s;ame per&s;ons, I know you, that you have not the love of <HI>God</HI> in you. But according to this author, not only the love of <HI>God,</HI> but he him&s;elf was in the&s;e whited &s;epulchres, the&s;e dete&s;table hy|pocrites, though they were daily plotting his death, and hour|ly thir&s;ting for his blood. They were, as <HI>Je&s;us</HI> well knew, implacable enemies both to truth and virtue. And he pro|nounced them entirely evil, for he very clearly &s;aw through the di&s;gui&s;e, and plainly perceived that they covered their hatred with lying lips. While they pretended to the highe&s;t degree of &s;anctity, the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God</HI> e&s;teemed them the wor&s;t of men, and the vile&s;t of &s;inners. And yet, according to our <HI>&s;ermon,</HI> he declared they had in them the &s;eed of all good. He mu&s;t be a connoi&s;&s;eur in the rules of <HI>logic,</HI> who can recon|cile the&s;e things to <HI>rea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>On this head, we are pre&s;ented with the peculiar character|i&s;tic of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> true mini&s;ters. They take him for their only pattern, and make his &s;ermons the &s;ole model of their preach|ing. <Q>He directed man to the &s;eed of the woman, which is within, and &s;o do they. But all <HI>deceivers</HI> take another way, &amp;c.</Q> Yet we do not find that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> ever once mentioned &s;uch a direction in the whole cour&s;e of his mini&s;try. Read

<P>NOR did his <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> at any time give this direction to their hearers or readers. There is not in the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> one expre&s;&s;ion that can be con&s;trued to that import, without a manife&s;t perver&s;ion of the &s;acred text. The con&s;tant &s;cope of the in&s;pired writers, in&s;tead of directing men to &s;omething within them, is to urge them to a &s;peedy renunciation of them|&s;elves, and a believing application to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who now &s;itteth on the right hand of <HI>God,</HI> not in their hearts, but in the highe&s;t Heaven. The effrontery of this man mu&s;t be great indeed, when he &s;o ra&s;hly condemns the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> and at lea&s;t a great majority of their faithful &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, as a malignant junto of <HI>impo&s;tors</HI> and <HI>deceivers</HI> of mankind. Certainly he was not in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, as he pretends el&s;ewhere, when he &s;hot this random dart, when he hurl'd this &s;urly, malapert, virulent invective again&s;t the generation of the <HI>Righteous.</HI> But <HI>(aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus)</HI> it is a rare &s;teed that never &s;tumbles. However, we &s;hall claim the <HI>liberty</HI> of judging for our&s;elves; and profe&s;s to believe there have been and &s;till are a goodly number of mini&s;ters, and of different denominations too, who will be accepted at the <HI>la&s;t day,</HI> as faithful &s;ervants of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;incere <HI>lovers</HI> of man|kind, though they never as much as thought of directing peo|ple to this <HI>in&s;poken &s;eed,</HI> of which we can find no account in the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> which, ble&s;&s;ed be <HI>God!</HI> are able to make us wi&s;e unto &s;alvation, though ELHANAN WINCHEST, had never exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>divine &s;eed,</HI> we are informed, <Q>is the only beginning and po&s;&s;ibility of a new life. Unle&s;s the means of <HI>grace</HI> can reach that <HI>hidden &s;park,</HI> they can do us no good, any more than the &s;un, &amp;c. could cau&s;e a flint to vegetate.

them till at lea&s;t &s;ome time after their fall. And why may it not be di&s;&s;eminated in the hearts of their children at any age, though it was not born with them? Is any thing too hard for the Lord? Our regeneration in Scripture is called a <HI>new creature</HI>; or, as it may be rendered, a <HI>new creation.</HI> Now to create, every body mu&s;t know, is a producing &s;ome &s;ub&s;tance out of no pre-exi&s;tent matter; or making &s;ome being out of nothing. But agreeable to this sermon, rege|neration is but blowing the hidden &s;park into a flame, or rai&s;|ing the latent &s;eed to a &s;talk, which is but a re&s;urrection at mo&s;t; nor can it be called a creation in any &s;en&s;e whatever, When <HI>God Almighty</HI> ble&s;&s;es men with his &s;aving grace, he puts his &s;pirit within them, which was not there before. And the &s;ame Agent puts his laws of faith and love into their hearts, to both which, in their natural e&s;tate, they are all of them without exception utter &s;trangers. St. Paul, when delineating that great change, gives us this beautiful de&s;crip|tion of it: <HI>God,</HI> who commanded the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined into our hearts, to <HI>give</HI> the light of the knowledge of the glory of <HI>God,</HI> in the face of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>HERE the Apo&s;tle evidently alludes to the fir&s;t creation. The primitive chaos was covered with total darkne&s;s until <HI>God</HI> &s;aid let there be light. So is the heart of every man by na|ture. It is not only a dark region, but darkne&s;s it&s;elf. Ob&s;cu|rity in the ab&s;tract. And thus it remains until the <HI>new cre|ation</HI> commences. Then the &s;ame irre&s;i&s;tible <HI>power,</HI> that gave light to the natural world, be&s;tows it al&s;o on the &s;piritual world, the before ab&s;olutely blind, dark and ignorant &s;oul of man. A glorious ray from the <HI>Sun</HI> of righteou&s;ne&s;s enters the under|&s;tanding, and with amazing effulgence irradiates the mind: Even as the terraqueous globe was illuminated in a moment, when the divine fiat was uttered. Truly, the earth in its original form was an apt emblem of our native depravity, and the light which was immediately communicated is a lively image of God's grace freely imparted, and which alone effects our <HI>new birth</HI> and conver&s;ion. Was there no|thing arbitrary in the fir&s;t creation? Did this material world &s;pring up only according to the po&s;&s;ibilities of nature? Did it, with all its &s;tupendous phoenomena, ari&s;e as a &s;talk out
<PB N="19" REF="017740_0019_0FA26A19979CE048">
of &s;ome pre-exi&s;tent &s;eed? No &s;urely! Unle&s;s we hold that the &s;ub&s;tance of all viable things was from eternity, as it is reported the old Peripatetic Philo&s;ophers really did. Neither does the new creation proceed from any principle hid in a man's brea&s;t before, but is produced out of nothing, ju&s;t as the old creation was. Therefore the &s;ermon, in this particu|lar al&s;o, differs very widely from the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> The author, in the mean while, gives us to know the cau&s;e why all are not regenerated. And this he illu&s;trates by an elegant &s;imilitude: <Q>If the &s;eed is covered with &s;tones, or rocks, or mountains, the &s;un cannot reach it: Even &s;o, all are not brought to the divine life, becau&s;e of the oppo&s;itions made to it, and ob&s;tructions that hinder it.</Q> But does not Mr. Winche&s;ter know, that there is a very great di&s;pa|rity between corporeal and &s;piritual things? Though we take compari&s;ons from the former to a&s;&s;i&s;t our conceptions, yet we never expert them fully to repre&s;ent the latter; and that be|cau&s;e of their va&s;tly &s;uperior excellency. It is true, the great ruler of the day cannot pierce through rocks, &amp;c. to quicken the grain that is concealed beneath them: But is almighty per|fection as impotent as the creature he has made? Can <HI>omni|potency</HI> operate with no more energy than a lifele&s;s luminary, all who&s;e &s;plendours were kindled with his breath? Is he not able to rai&s;e up children unto Abraham out of the &s;tones? Are not the rocks thrown down by him? And do not the per|petual hills bow, and the everla&s;ting mountains melt at his touch, and flow down at his pre&s;ence? God can overcome all oppo&s;ition, and remove every ob&s;truction ju&s;t when he plea&s;es; for he worketh all things according to the coun&s;el of his <HI>own will.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, men can and always do with&s;tand this good work. And it is certain that &s;ome of them have re&s;i&s;ted the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> &s;o wilfully, and &s;o long, till <HI>God</HI> has given them up as incurable patients, and &s;worn in his wrath ye &s;hall not enter into my re&s;t. The&s;e are &s;mitten with judicial blindne&s;s, and their conver&s;ion becomes impo&s;&s;ible, as the &s;criptures clearly te&s;tify; and that becau&s;e it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the truth of <HI>God</HI> to give them his &s;aving grace afterwards. Therefore, where people were quite hardened in unbelief, our Lord could not do many mighty works as man, becau&s;e he had no com|mi&s;&s;ion

Becau&s;e &s;uch, who tru&s;t in riches, as it is explained in another place, do certainly reject all the means of &s;alvation; and while they continue to do &s;o, it is not only difficult but impo&s;&s;ible for them to receive <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> or be made partakers of his benefits. Yet with <HI>God</HI> nothing is impo&s;&s;ible. When he re&s;olves to convert a &s;inner, no impediment whatever can hinder his de&s;ign.

<P>HAVING paved his way with the poli&s;hed &s;tones of error thus far, our author comes at la&s;t to a more particular con&s;i|deration of his main point, <HI>the glorious doctrine of the final re&s;toration of all things.</HI> This his mo&s;t beloved &s;entiment, he &s;uppo&s;es, naturally follows from his preceding ob&s;ervations. But the mi&s;ery is, it does neither follow from &s;cripture, or rea&s;on, or the common &s;en&s;e of mankind. He &s;ays it has been for a long time greatly clouded over with <HI>antichri&s;tian darkne&s;s.</HI> If &s;o, it is a pity this cloud was ever di&s;per&s;ed. Even the &s;hades of night may &s;ometimes prove advantageous to men. It may hide &s;everal loath&s;ome objects from their eyes. And if antichri&s;tian darkne&s;s &s;erved for a long &s;ea&s;on, as he tells us, to cover &s;uch a putrid ma&s;s of here&s;y, and conceal it from the chri&s;tian world, it was indeed a benefit, in&s;tead of an injury.</P>
<P>BUT, by his leave, this doctrine was never as much as once heard of, until Antichri&s;t had &s;tirred up abundance of wrath and darkne&s;s in the primitive church, as he a&s;&s;ures us Lucifer did formerly in the profound center of nature. We have no account of it during the two fir&s;t centuries. This notion of a general redemption from Hell was fir&s;t broached by one <HI>Origen,</HI> who lived in the year of our <HI>Lord</HI> two hundred and thirty. With this, the &s;ame man held many other mon&s;trous opinions, which were afterwards propagated by his followers, who, after his name, were called Origeni&s;ts. The&s;e prevailed and infe&s;ted the church until the &s;ixth century, when they were condemned in general council, and Origen's books on &s;uch &s;ubjects cen&s;ured as dangerous, and forbidden to be read. Of this Origen it is reported, that he was endowed with a
<PB N="21" REF="017740_0021_0FA26A1AA5FE8448">
memory &s;o tenacious, that he could readily repeat the whole Bible by heart. I have al&s;o heard the &s;ame thing of Mr. Winche&s;ter; and probably they were born under the &s;ame pla|net. However that may be, the &s;aid Origen does not appear to have been any great arti&s;t in con&s;truing the &s;criptures. For he, under&s;tanding our Saviour's words, <Q>there be &s;ome who have made them&s;elves <HI>Eunuchs</HI> for the Kingdom of Hea|ven's &s;ake,</Q> in a literal &s;en&s;e, thereupon laid violent hands on his own virility, and cruelly ema&s;culated him&s;elf. Ju&s;t as if our <HI>Lord</HI> had recommended ca&s;tration as the only way to immortal <HI>glory.</HI> This &s;hews that the <HI>glorious</HI> doctrine we are examining &s;prung at fir&s;t from no very creditable &s;ource; for what dependence can be put on authors, however eminent for parts or learning, when it is well known they have fallen into &s;uch &s;plenetic dreams, into &s;uch pitiful and di&s;tracted dotages!</P>
<P>ON this topic Mr. <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> flouri&s;hes in all the pomp of heroi&s;m. His magnanimity appears in every line. Having pre&s;&s;ed &s;everal precious texts of Scripture into his &s;ervice, he ranges his arguments in due form, and, mu&s;tering his whole force, fires his &s;yllogi&s;ms like chained &s;hot. But, though his courage is evidently great, military &s;kill is wanting. His ar|tillery is but poorly &s;erved, for his balls do little or no ex|ecution. Some of them fly too high, others too low, and every one falls &s;hort of the mark.</P>
<P>UNLESS all creatures become guilty of &s;in, and mi&s;erable in con&s;equence of their fall, be at la&s;t re&s;tored to happine&s;s, he declares <Q>the promi&s;e in his text can never have a perfect accompli&s;hment; yea, upon the common &s;y&s;tems, it has &s;carce any meaning at all. <HI>God</HI> has &s;worn by the Prophet, that to him every knee &s;hall bow, and every tongue &s;hall &s;wear; and by an Apo&s;tle repeats the &s;ame &s;olemn declara|tion. It is promi&s;ed that <HI>God</HI> will reconcile all things to him&s;elf. Death &s;hall be de&s;troyed, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. No <HI>enemy</HI> &s;hall be left. <HI>God</HI> is able, and he is willing to re&s;tore all things. Therefore it &s;hall be done, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>BUT, under correction, we cannot yet help thinking that a leading malefactor may be totally &s;ubdued by a Prince, and yet retain his enmity to his government as long as he lives. And why may it not be properly &s;aid that the &s;erpent's head
<PB N="22" REF="017740_0022_0FA26A1B636E1950">
is brui&s;ed, and his works de&s;troyed, though neither he nor any of his incorrigible confederates &s;hould ever be reconciled to <HI>God?</HI></P>
<P>SUPPOSE &s;ome powerful tyrant had, by u&s;urpation, &s;eized a con&s;iderable part of a certain King's dominion, who&s;e royal title was indi&s;putable, had drawn many of his former &s;ubjects into rebellion, had very &s;trongly intrenched and fortified him|&s;elf, bidding defiance to the lawful Monarch, and daily &s;preading terror and deva&s;tation all around. In the mean while it was foretold by &s;everal, who pretended to the gift of prophecy, that the King would in &s;ome future period of time &s;end his own &s;on to make war upon this tyrant, and that he &s;hould by force of arms utterly overthrow him, and take all his illegal acqui&s;itions out of his hands. At la&s;t the illu&s;tri|ous <HI>hero</HI> appears, and lays &s;iege to the tyrant's capital city, and having battered down the walls, and forced an entrance by &s;torm, he &s;ets up his white flag, and by &s;ound of trumpet cau&s;es it to be proclaimed through all the country, that &s;uch who had been &s;educed by the tyrant &s;hould be accepted to his Maje&s;ty's favour, and be honored again as the &s;ubjects of his kingdom, provided they would, in &s;uch a term as &s;peci|fied, throw down their arms, confe&s;s their folly, and &s;ue for pardon and reconciliation. But whereas but few, compa|ratively, chu&s;e to comply with his gracious overture, the con|quer condemns not only the tyrant, but likewi&s;e all who re|fu&s;ed to receive quarters, either to immediate death, or dooms them to perpetual bani&s;hment into &s;ome foreign realm, and con&s;igns them to the mo&s;t abject &s;ervitude and irrecoverable &s;lavery. Now, this done, was &s;ome haughty politician, in order to di&s;play the &s;uperiority of his judgment, to declare that the ancient prediction was fal&s;e, for the conque&s;t was far from being compleat, nor can it ever be perfected till this ty|rant, with all his accomplices in ho&s;tility, are redeemed from their bondage, called home to the King's Court, and not only &s;o, but are dignified with all the immunities, and indulged with the &s;ame privileges which his be&s;t &s;ubjects enjoy; nay, they mu&s;t be admitted into the King's palace, they mu&s;t fea&s;t at his table,&mdash;yea, which is &s;till more, they mu&s;t be rai&s;ed to the throne, and be made partners in his crown; for until all this is done, the victory is but partial, and the hero's tri|umph

but mock pageanty and illu&s;ive o&s;tentation. Would not &s;uch rea&s;oning be univer&s;ally exploded as ridiculous to the la&s;t degree? And what could the impertinent author ju&s;tly ex|pect, but to be hi&s;&s;ed out of countenance, and e&s;teemed as a madman wherever he went? Yet this is the exact picture of Mr. <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI>'s elaborate ratiocination on this &s;ubject. His arguments, in all their formality, have ju&s;t as much force to prove, that unle&s;s wicked men and devils are in general re|lea&s;ed from their infernal torment, the promi&s;es of <HI>God</HI> can|not be fulfilled, nor will <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> ever &s;ee the entire travail of his &s;oul, and be &s;atisfied. In &s;hort, it is very clear that all the &s;criptures this author has recited in the&s;e pages, or in any other part of his performance, do, when put together, prove nothing more than this, viz. that our glorious redeemer &s;hall reign till all his enemies are made his foot&s;tool. Heaven, and earth, and hell, &s;hall eternally re&s;ound with his peerle&s;s exploits, and angels, men and devils, with one everla&s;ting &s;hout, recognize his matchle&s;s atchievements. His friends &s;hall voluntarily give all po&s;&s;ible <HI>glory</HI> to the <HI>Lamb,</HI> and his foes &s;hall yield him an equal tribute of prai&s;e, though by compul&s;ion. For &s;urely a &s;lave may vow allegiance unto and bow down to a conqueror, though he does both with the greate&s;t reluctance. A felon may acknowledge the authority of his Judge, and confe&s;s the equity of the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon him, though at the &s;ame time his heart may be filled with an implacable antipathy to his per&s;on, in&s;omuch that, was it in his power, he would gladly &s;tab him with a mortal wound, and rejoice in the perpetration of &s;o horrid an act. So here, the reprobate world &s;hall doubtle&s;s bow, and kneel, and con|fe&s;s, and &s;wear, and deeply &s;ubmit to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> owning his ab&s;olute and incontroulable Sovereignty. But all this is far from arguing their emancipation. It does not at all prove their future enlargement. For this, all this they may, yea, and &s;hall do in their infernal pri&s;on. All this they &s;hall do with &s;empiternal &s;orrow, and angui&s;h, and weeping, and gna&s;hing of teeth, without the lea&s;t hope of any deliverance from the fiery dungeons into which they will be ca&s;t, as ab|horred of the <HI>Lord,</HI> and rueful victims of his inexorable <HI>fury,</HI> and <HI>wrath,</HI> and <HI>anger,</HI> and <HI>indignation!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="017740_0024_0FA26A1D38BBAA98">IN the conclu&s;ion of his di&s;cour&s;e the author lays down five propo&s;itions, on which he &s;ays the glorious doctrine is built, all which mu&s;t be proved to be fal&s;e, before it can be over|thrown. In the&s;e, he lets us know, con&s;i&s;ts the merit of his cau&s;e; <Q>the&s;e are the foundation principles or which the mighty &s;uper&s;tructure re&s;ts; and till the&s;e are overthrown, all attempts again&s;t the doctrine are vain.</Q> So, then, far as we have proceeded, we have &s;carcely yet &s;et out upon our journey. And behold! mountain upon mountain, in terrible gradation, placed before us. To remove them, it &s;eems, is impracticable, and to climb over them at lea&s;t very difficult, if not altogether impo&s;&s;ible; and one or the other we mu&s;t do, or renounce particular redemption, and embrace the glo|rious doctrine, the re&s;toration of all things. A perplexing dilemma indeed! However, <HI>fortune favours the brave.</HI> En|couraged by this good old apothegm, we &s;hall attempt the latter; <HI>i. e.</HI> we will endeavour to make our way over all the&s;e craggy cliffs, rather than give up the truth. And by permi&s;&s;ion, we &s;hall take a view of his propo&s;itions in order.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <Q>GOD is love, e&s;&s;entially and communicatively, and loves all the beings he has made, con&s;idered as his crea|tures, and is con&s;tantly &s;eeking to do them good.</Q> This is all true; and if &s;o, we may be &s;ure he will u&s;e the be&s;t means in his power to prevent their falling into &s;in, and there|by involving them&s;elves in mi&s;ery. And what means could be &s;o likely to effect this mo&s;t loving de&s;ign as the a&s;&s;uring them, that if they ventured to tran&s;gre&s;s they mu&s;t <Q>&s;uffer his ever|la&s;ting di&s;plea&s;ure, as the natural con&s;equence of their re|bellion!</Q></P>
<P>IF GOD would rule his creatures at all, he mu&s;t appoint certain laws for their ob&s;ervation. For without laws, there can be no government. But laws are of no validity, without &s;ome penalties annexed; and penalties would be of no force, without a &s;trict execution. Is it incon&s;i&s;tent with a &s;upreme magi&s;trate's affection to his &s;ubjects for him to put the laws in execution? Does it di&s;cover a di&s;regard to their welfare to puni&s;h thieves, and robbers, and murderers, and traitors, &amp;c. &amp;c. with death? Quite the rever&s;e. Neither is it contrary to the e&s;&s;ential or communicative <HI>love of God</HI> to fulfil his righ|teous threatenings, in the everla&s;ting perdition of all his ob&s;ti|nate
<PB N="25" REF="017740_0025_0FA26A20C8136DB8">
and irreclaimable enemies, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e whom he often called to repentance, promi&s;ing them remi&s;&s;ion of their guilt, provided they would return to their duty. If, after all, many of them pertinaciou&s;ly per&s;i&s;t in their wickedne&s;s until the act of indemnity is repealed, who, I be&s;eech you, is cul|pable of their eternal ruin but them&s;elves? <HI>God</HI> can and does &s;till love them, con&s;idered as his creatures, but not as his in|veterate foes. As &s;uch he hates, and will puni&s;h them, and that in perfect proportion to their &s;everal de&s;erts. So then we have happily pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t of the&s;e mountains.</P>
<P N="2"><Q>2dly. GOD's de&s;ign, in creating intelligent beings, was to make them happy in the knowledge and love of his glo|rious perfections.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q>3dly. GOD's ab&s;olute ultimate de&s;igns cannot be eternal|ly fru&s;trated.</Q> But, as they were free agents, their hap|pine&s;s depended on their perfect obedience during the &s;pace of their probation. But in ca&s;e any of them revolted, one of <HI>God</HI>'s ab&s;olute de&s;igns was, according to his threatening, and as appears by the event, that they &s;hould &s;uffer for &s;o doing. Therefore, though many of them are left to peri&s;h in and for their &s;ins, <HI>God</HI>'s de&s;igns are neither temporally nor eternally fru&s;trated by their fall. Thus we have gained a pa&s;&s;age over two of the&s;e mountains at once.</P>
<P N="4"><Q>4thly. CHRIST died for all men (he &s;hould have added for all devils too) and died not in vain.</Q></P>
<P>THAT the merit of our <HI>dear Redeemer</HI>'s death is &s;ufficient in value to &s;ave all men, is granted: For his blood clean&s;eth from all &s;in. If men, therefore, refu&s;e to apply this remedy, what can they expect but to die under the cur&s;e of God's holy law? It is an Apo&s;tle's interrogation, <Q>How &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neglect <HI>&s;o great &s;alvation?</HI></Q> Neither is the virtue of our Saviour's pa&s;&s;ion lo&s;t, though multitudes peri&s;h by under|valuing it. No medicine, however powerful to heal, will prove beneficial until applied. If a &s;ick per&s;on rejects the phy&s;ic offered unto him, and dies by his ob&s;tinacy, who&s;e fault is it? Who&s;e but the patient's&punc; The phy&s;ic remains as efficacious as if he, and ten thou&s;ands more, had taken it, and had all been re&s;tored to health by its operation. Be&s;ides, all mankind do actually receive &s;everal benefits in this world, in con&s;equence of our <HI>Lord</HI>'s mediation. All that temporal
<PB N="26" REF="017740_0026_0FA26A2212CC64A8">
felicity that nations, as well as particular per&s;ons, are indul|ged with, flows from no other fountain but the merit of his blood. The go&s;pel, con&s;idered only as a &s;y&s;tem of morals, is doubtle&s;s in it&s;elf the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing any kingdom or com|monwealth can be favoured with; and where that go&s;pel is truly preached, though but a &s;mall number, comparatively, may be &s;avingly converted, yet multitudes have been greatly reformed thereby,&mdash;their corruptions have been and &s;till are in a great mea&s;ure re&s;trained, and innumerable iniquities pre|vented, which otherwi&s;e they would have committed. Now, as it is as clear as Scripture light can make it that there is a con&s;iderable inequality even in the torments of <HI>hell,</HI> rea&s;on &s;ays the&s;e per&s;ons cannot be as mi&s;erable in a future &s;tate as the athei&s;t, the bla&s;phemer, the per&s;ecutor, the deceiver of men, the hypocrite, and tho&s;e profane wretches who declare their &s;in as Sodom, and hide it not.</P>
<P>THEREFORE Chri&s;t is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing:&mdash;Chri&s;t is the choice&s;t donation that could be conferred on our world, even if it had no relation to the next. It follows, then, that this objection, if all men (yea and devils too) are not at la&s;t crowned with glory, and exalted to the regions of endle&s;s ho|nour, Chri&s;t died in vain, is but a groundle&s;s &s;urmi&s;e, with|out either Scripture or rea&s;on to &s;upport it. So we are got beyond another mountain.</P>
<P N="5"><Q>5thly. CHRIST came to de&s;troy the evil principle, or &s;in, out of the univer&s;e, which he will finally effect, and then mi&s;ery &s;hall be no more.</Q> Had he &s;aid, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> came into this world to de&s;troy &s;in, and bani&s;h mi&s;ery out of it, which he will certainly effect, the whole propo&s;ition would have been granted, <HI>nemine contradicente.</HI> But that he will de|&s;troy it out of hell is denied. Becau&s;e we are a&s;&s;ured by in|&s;piration, that the fire that burns there is ab&s;olutely unquench|able; that the torment &s;uffered in that flaming pit is in dura|tion eternal; and that the pains of damnation are &s;trictly and properly everla&s;ting, and will continue in <HI>&s;ecula &s;eculorum, forever,</HI> yea, <HI>forever</HI> and <HI>ever. Chri&s;t</HI> never de&s;cended into <HI>hell,</HI> neither did nor will he ever redeem any of its inhabitants. Thus we have made a &s;hift to &s;urpa&s;s all the&s;e mountains,&mdash; and, through mercy, are not yet quite out of breath, and hope we &s;hall have more level ground to walk on for the future.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="017740_0027_0FA26A2229A583A8">BUT Mr. <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> in his appendix, labours to prove that the <HI>words eternal,</HI> and <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> and <HI>forever,</HI> yea, and <HI>for|ever and ever,</HI> are as often, in the holy Scriptures, u&s;ed to denote a limited duration, as an endle&s;s eternity. The words he a&s;&s;ures us are <Q>equivocal; &s;o that no conclu&s;ive argument can be formed from them to prove the endle&s;s torments of the damned.</Q> But he is obliged to allow, that they are &s;ometimes applied to an endle&s;s duration. Why then &s;hould we not under&s;tand, that the meaning of the in&s;pired writers was to let us know that the mi&s;ery of the wicked, as well as the happine&s;s of the righteous, &s;hall be really eternal? e&s;pe|cially as they de&s;cribe both by one and the &s;ame term. When our Lord declares, that the former &s;hall go away into everla&s;t|ing puni&s;hment, but the latter into life eternal, it is well known that the word, though varied in our tran&s;lation, is the very &s;ame in the original. So that, if the reward of grace is eternal, the penalty of ju&s;tice mu&s;t be of equal duration, ac|cording to our Saviour's very plain repre&s;entation of the la&s;t judgment. And to accu&s;e the Prophets and Apo&s;tles, yea, the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, with &s;peaking to poor &s;in|ners in equivocal terms, or words of a double meaning, is an impeachment that does not at all become the tongue or pen of a Chri&s;tian. Was this in&s;olent charge as true as it is fal&s;e, what dependence could be put in <HI>Divine Revelation</HI>? Nay, that can be no revelation at all, but rather a riddle, that is delivered in &s;uch a manner. Alas! into what pernicious blunders! Yea, into what &s;hocking and nefarious bla&s;phemies will men fall by error and delu&s;ion, when they have once e&s;pou&s;ed their intere&s;t, and are engaged to plead their cau&s;e for &s;ome &s;ecular emolument!</P>
<P>BUT that the words mentioned above are all, or any of them, u&s;ed as much as once in the whole Bible to &s;ignify a limited duration, is an a&s;&s;ertion I ab&s;olutely deny. Nor does the in&s;tances he has produced, nor all he can collect hereafter, evince the contrary. They con&s;tantly and every where im|port nothing &s;hort of a perpetual exi&s;tence of the thing &s;poken of, whatever it is.</P>
<P>To have a clear conception of this important truth, we mu&s;t con&s;ider that the various ceremonies of the Levitical law, as well as the &s;everal predictions of the Jewi&s;h Prophets,
<PB N="28" REF="017740_0028_0FA26A22DD7AFB58">
had for the mo&s;t part, if not always, a direct reference to the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. For in&s;tance, the land of Canaan, pro|mi&s;ed to Abraham and his &s;eed, was a type of heaven, which is an eternal inheritance, and &s;hall be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by all his &s;pi|ritual children forever and ever. The covenant of circumci|&s;ion typified the covenant made with Chri&s;t, and in him with all the elect, which is doubtle&s;s eternal, and will remain in full force and virtue forever and ever. The prie&s;thood of Aaron repre&s;ented the prie&s;thood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which is eternal, and will by him be continued without ce&s;&s;ation or in|terruption forever and ever. The horrible flame kindled to con&s;ume Sodom and Gomorrah was a &s;triking figure of hell fire, which is eternal, and will burn forever and ever. The fire continually pre&s;erved by the &s;ons of Aaron on the altar was emblematical either of the love of God to his people, or his wrath again&s;t his enemies, both of which are eternal, and will continue forever and ever. Even &s;o, all the promi&s;es divulged, and the threatenings denounced by the ancient Pro|phets, although they had a primary re&s;pect to temporal ble&s;&s;|ings or cur&s;es, yet without di&s;pute they bore a relation to &s;piritual rewards and puni&s;hments, both of which are likewi&s;e eternal, and will endure forever, yea, forever and ever.</P>
<P>THUS the words, even in the Old Te&s;tament, always ex|tend to an unbounded duration: How much more &s;o in the New! But our author in&s;i&s;ts upon it, and repeats it over and over again, that the&s;e words &s;ignify ages, and ages of ages, and periods, and periodical <HI>eternities!</HI> Tremendous doom! This is wor&s;e and wor&s;e! We only plead that the wicked &s;hall &s;uffer but one eternity; but he avers they &s;hall &s;uffer, &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, &s;everal eternities, and nobody can count how many! Where he found &s;uch idle, in&s;ipid, as well as fallaci|ous &s;tuff, whether in the Alcoran of Mahomet, or in the writings of Jacob Boehman, or whether it be the fiction of his own fertile genius, he be&s;t knows. One thing is certain, there is nothing any how re&s;embling it in the <HI>Book of God.</HI></P>
<P>As to his rea&s;onings about the unpardonable &s;in, had he noticed what is very vi&s;ible in the divine oracles, he would have lo&s;t all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he fancies can be derived from our Saviour's words concerning it. The verb to forgive, in &s;acred dialect, &s;ometimes &s;ignifies no more than to exempt from
<PB N="29" REF="017740_0029_0FA26A23A350D908">
pre&s;ent puni&s;hment. So Mo&s;es reminds the Lord, that he had forgiven his people I&s;rael from Egypt until now, though we are a&s;&s;ured he vi&s;ited their iniquities upon them, and that with terrible judgment afterwards. Thus God may forgive whole nations and communities for &s;everal years, yet puni&s;h them, and very &s;everely at la&s;t. Thus God winked at the &s;ins of the heathens in the times of their ignorance; <HI>i. e.</HI> he bore their provocations with long &s;uffering and patience, becau&s;e they had not the means of knowing better. But this was not the ca&s;e with the Jews, e&s;pecially in our Saviour's days. They &s;inned again&s;t the clear light both of his doc|trine and miracles, and thereby brought down the mo&s;t griev|ous calamities on them&s;elves that ever befel any nation. Therefore, when our <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Lord</HI> &s;ays that that &s;in &s;hall never be forgiven, he evidently means that the Phari&s;ees, and all others who proved guilty of it, &s;hould &s;uffer his highe&s;t di&s;|plea&s;ure, not only in hell hereafter, but even in this pre&s;ent world, as we know they did. So that this declaration is far enough from proving that all other &s;ins &s;hall be pardoned in the next life, as he vain-gloriou&s;ly a&s;&s;erts.</P>
<P>AND although Job and Jeremiah wi&s;hed they were never born, this was only &s;poken with regard to their pre&s;ent afflic|tions; <HI>i. e.</HI> had they no pro&s;pect of a beter life hereafter, they &s;uppo&s;ed it more eligible to have had no being at all. Ac|cording to the Apo&s;tle, <Q>if in this life only we have hope, we are of all men the mo&s;t mi&s;erable.</Q> So that the&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e holy men don't at all prove that Judas might be &s;aved, though our <HI>Lord</HI> declared it were good for that man if he had never been born.</P>
<P>WE might proceed to con&s;ider the other &s;criptures, which he tells us are objected again&s;t his glorious doctrine, and which he maintains are rather for than again&s;t him; but it is judged needle&s;s at pre&s;ent. It would &s;well this piece beyond the in|tended dimen&s;ions,&mdash;and prolixity on any &s;ubject is my aver|&s;ion. I &s;hall, therefore, only take a little more notice of that <HI>in&s;poken &s;eed</HI> he &s;o zealou&s;ly recommends, and then come to a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>WE are told that this <Q><HI>&s;eed</HI> lies in unregenerate men, co|vered with <HI>death</HI> and <HI>darkne&s;s,</HI> until Chri&s;t, by his go&s;pel, reaches and draws it into motion.</Q> It &s;eems, then, that it
<PB N="30" REF="017740_0030_0FA26A24584349D8">
is invi&s;ible, and not to be &s;een even by the &s;ouls in which it is buried. Nor do we find that it is to be heard by them, for it is dead and buried. How then can it &s;peak? And accord|ing to this de&s;cription, it is impo&s;&s;ible to comprehend the na|ture of this <HI>&s;eed.</HI> Nor can we conceive what it is good for. If Chri&s;t, the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s, mu&s;t reach it, previous to its vivification, it is certainly u&s;ele&s;s, and an&s;wers no purpo&s;e at all. For one &s;ingle ray of divine light flowing from Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and darted into the &s;inner's heart, is abundantly &s;uf|ficient to effect the ble&s;&s;ed change, without borrowing any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from this inanimate and &s;epultured &s;eed. Moreover, in what part of the unconverted &s;inner is this &s;eed to be found? In his under&s;tanding? No; that is all darkne&s;s. In his mind? No; that is all enmity again&s;t God. In his will? No; that is all rebellion. In his affections? No; they are all pollution and carnality.</P>
<P>THE author tells us, that immediately after their fall the bodies of our fir&s;t parents became like bea&s;ts, and their &s;ouls like fallen angels. Now Mo&s;es &s;ays Adam beg at children in his own image. It follows then that all his po&s;terity are born in the perfect likene&s;s of Adam, whatever that is. And if you enquire what it is, the famous Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> in one of his Sermons, an&s;wers, <Q>man, in his natural &s;tate, is half <HI>bea&s;t,</HI> half <HI>devil!</HI></Q> With this good man, Mr. Winche&s;ter exactly agrees. There is a perfect con&s;onance in the import of their expre&s;&s;ions, only the latter chu&s;es to be a little politer in the more di&s;agreeable part of the portraiture. Perhaps he was afraid he &s;hould offend &s;ome of his able&s;t friends, had he uttered his &s;entiments in &s;uch har&s;h and grating language as the other did. The picture, however, is odious enough. Nor does it at all exceed the truth. And if the per&s;on of a grace|le&s;s man is indeed &s;uch a motly mixture of <HI>bea&s;tiality</HI> and <HI>devili&s;m,</HI> in what part &s;hall we find the dreary &s;epulchre where this admirable <HI>&s;eed</HI> lies interred? In the brutal part? No, certainly! For there can be no divinity in a bea&s;t. In the diabolical? Surely no! For if no divine principle can dwell in a bea&s;t, much le&s;s can it find an abode in the devil. There|fore, after the mo&s;t accurate &s;crutiny and a&s;&s;iduous inve&s;tiga|tion, we are obliged to give up, and conclude with this con|viction, it is to be found <HI>no where!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="017740_0031_0FA26A2583C214F8">THERE is in this &s;eed &s;omething &s;uperlatively &s;trange! It is a beam of light, yet it is not perceptible. It is a &s;park of fire, but without heat. It is an orator, yet not audible. It is able to teach us all we need to know, and yet it is quite &s;ilent, and as dumb as death! It can be no &s;ub&s;tantive, for it is not to be &s;een, heard, felt or under&s;tood. Neither is it an adjective; for it is de&s;criptive of no quality whatever. It is not white, nor black, nor hot, nor cold, nor great, nor &s;mall, nor good, nor bad. In &s;hort, it is ju&s;t what the inge|nious Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> makes &s;pace to be, viz. a mere vacuum, a non-entity, a nothing but a name.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>&s;eed,</HI> or <HI>&s;park,</HI> it appears by the whole current of the &s;ermon, is that mo&s;t benevolent &s;hepherd, who &s;hall at la&s;t lead the whole flock of once de&s;pairing goats out of the infer|nal de&s;art, &s;hall transform them into amiable &s;heep, and ga|ther them into the &s;old of cele&s;tial <HI>glory,</HI> where they &s;hall bleat forth one eternal hallelujah to their adored deliverer. Nor will Lucifer and his angels be left behind. No! They &s;hall all of them be partakers of the triumph, and gladly join the univer&s;al acclamation of prai&s;e. Though this will prove a very tedious enterprize; nor can it be accompli&s;hed, it &s;eems, until many ages are elap&s;ed; nay, until numberle&s;s, long, reluctant, tardy, &s;low-circling, periodical eternities have performed their &s;everal revolutions; and then &s;in and mi&s;ery &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>BUT what are &s;ome wicked men &s;ent to hell for at all? One would think that the &s;un would reach this &s;eed, and bring it up while they were on earth; or that if it fails here, their ca&s;e will be hopele&s;s: For the nearer the &s;un, the more and &s;tronger influence it mu&s;t have on any &s;ub&s;tance. And hell, every body mu&s;t allow, is farther from heaven than our earth is. If he &s;ays the fire of Tophet will rend or melt the&s;e rocks that now cover the &s;eed, does not this attribute more &s;aving virtue to the flames of hell, than to the blood of <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> Though he tells us, that when it was &s;hed, it evi|dently had a phy&s;ical virtue over nature it&s;elf. It cau&s;ed the earth to &s;hake, the rocks to rend, and the graves to open. And yet all this power, and virtue, and efficacy, is not of &s;uffi|cient energy to quicken this &s;eed, until the &s;oil in which it is &s;own is purged in the furnace of damnation. In order to
<PB N="32" REF="017740_0032_0FA26A261ADFE5E8">
which, &s;ome parts of it at lea&s;t mu&s;t burn during innumera|ble <HI>eternities.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is purgatory with a contradiction. But was that all, it would be a trifle in compari&s;on.</P>
<P>IT is, alas! it is a &s;hameful di&s;paragement to his <HI>blood,</HI> who is the true <HI>God</HI> and <HI>eternal life!</HI> But can he tell us, by who&s;e manuduction the <HI>devils</HI> &s;hall regain their <HI>freedom?</HI> For he &s;ays it, nay he repeats even to <HI>tautology,</HI> that all things &s;hall be re&s;tored, and of con&s;equence the&s;e aba&s;ed &s;pirits &s;hall regain their ancient honors, and re-a&s;cend their heavenly thrones. <HI>Did Chri&s;t die for them?</HI> He will hardly &s;ay <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> died for them al&s;o. For he took not on him the nature of angels. Nor have we received the lea&s;t account that <HI>God</HI> has provided any <HI>Mediator</HI> for tho&s;e wretched &s;pirits. If, there|fore, they are ever redeemed, it mu&s;t be by an arbitrary di&s;|pen&s;ation; though Mr. <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> will have nothing arbitrary in the whole proce&s;s, when it &s;uits him. But, if <HI>God</HI> &s;aves the reprobate angels by a &s;overeign act of his will, without any attonement or &s;atisfaction made to his ju&s;tice, why might not men be &s;aved by a like act of &s;overeignty? Does not this repre&s;ent the <HI>manifold wi&s;dom of God,</HI> in contriving the plan of our redemption, as <HI>horre&s;co referre!</HI> As what I dare not name? Upon this &s;uppo&s;ition too, our conde&s;cending, our amible and compa&s;&s;ionate <HI>Redeemer</HI> might have &s;pared all his labour, and &s;weat, and pains, and blood!</P>
<P>BUT we are told this light of Chri&s;t within man is not &s;omething di&s;tinct from <HI>divine revelation,</HI> much le&s;s in oppo&s;i|tion to it, but the <HI>beginning</HI> of it.</P>
<P>If &s;o, a written revelation is altogether unnece&s;&s;ary. For what u&s;e has he of a candle, who enjoys the &s;un in all its me|ridian glory? How were all the Prophets and Apo&s;tles deceiv|ed! They, hone&s;t men, thought they had &s;ome extraordinary in&s;tructions given them immediately by God, which the re&s;t of mankind were not favoured with. But it &s;eems they were ut|terly mi&s;taken. No, no, weak men, you might have kept your hi&s;tories, and prophecies, and go&s;pels, and epi&s;tles to your&s;elves! All men, without exception, have had, and &s;till have the very &s;ame and equal &s;hare of in&s;piration, which you either out of &s;implicity or roguery made a monopoly of. Ac|cording to this allegation, the light in us is not to be examin|ed
<PB N="33" REF="017740_0033_0FA26A29F10047F0">
by the holy Scriptures, but they are to be tried by it. So that the outward revelation mu&s;t always yield to this inward pedagogue. No wonder Mr. Winche&s;ter could &s;o ea&s;ily and clearly prove his <HI>glorious</HI> doctrine from the con&s;tant tenor of both Old and New Te&s;tament, and find it every where con|firmed with "Thus &s;aith the <HI>Lord."</HI> Why did he take &s;o much pains to quote particular pages from them? He might have pre&s;ented the whole <HI>Bible</HI> at once, and told us, as &s;ome pious preachers do of late&punc; This is my Confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Faith!</HI> This one argument would have been as forcible as all that he has offered both in his &s;ermon and the appendix, as the whole concatenation of citations, and repetitions, and reflections, and exclamations, and &s;yllogi&s;ms, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. It is only for him to &s;ay, with a &s;erious and reverend air, it was the light of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> within that taught me my hi&s;tory of the creation, and my &s;cheme of divinity too, and therefore they cannot be contrary to the &s;criptures; and for any of you to think or &s;peak otherwi&s;e is only to betray your weakne&s;s; for all you can &s;ay again&s;t them is fighting again&s;t God!</P>
<P>WHAT can we oppo&s;e to &s;uch ma&s;terly rea&s;onings as the&s;e? <HI>Ip&s;e dixit!</HI> We mu&s;t not gain&s;ay. No! We mu&s;t lay our hands upon our mouths. The point is decided. Both <HI>men</HI> and <HI>devils</HI> &s;hall certainly obtain a glorious re&s;toration. We have, &s;ome of us, for years pa&s;t ob&s;erved &s;undry new-fangled notions prevailing. A variety of &s;trange opinions, with re|&s;pect both to doctrine, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, have, like Jonah's gourd, &s;prung up in a night; and indeed &s;ome of them al&s;o withered in a night. Not long ago, we were told that God had no mercy at all. That compa&s;&s;ion did not be|long to the <HI>Divine nature</HI> in any &s;en&s;e. But behold! now this &s;ame <HI>Being</HI> is all <HI>mercy,</HI> and little or no ju&s;tice. In him there is neither <HI>fury, warth</HI> nor <HI>anger.</HI> Formerly it was po&s;itively affirmed that the elect were ju&s;tified from <HI>eternity,</HI> that Chri&s;t died only for that cho&s;en number, and never &s;hed a drop of his blood for the re&s;t of mankind, and that none but they were to be invited to come to a Saviour by any means. But lo! this wind is quite turned&mdash;and what weather next? Why, the whole race is now exactly on a par. Chri&s;t died equally for them all, yea, he is in them all. And they are all to be invited, and exhorted, and commanded, and per|&s;uaded,
<PB N="34" REF="017740_0034_0FA26A2B577ED8C8">
and intreated to receive him. Though, at the &s;ame time, they all have him in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he dwells in them all as an in&s;poken <HI>&s;eed.</HI></P>
<P>A year or two pa&s;t it was publicly proclaimed in this State, that the war was at an end, our independency was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the &s;ound of battle and de&s;truction &s;hould no more be heard in our land. But &s;ince that, alas! the &s;word has reach|ed even to the &s;oul of Virginia, many of our brave <HI>patriots</HI> have been quite impoveri&s;hed, and &s;ome have lo&s;t their lives by the hand of the enemy.</P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;ame time we were a&s;&s;ured, with the greate&s;t prophetic confidence, that the latter-day <HI>glory</HI> was ju&s;t now breaking forth, that the illu&s;trious morning had already be|gun to dawn, and we &s;hould very &s;oon &s;ee the <HI>&s;un.</HI> All na|tions would &s;peedily be converted, the whole <HI>church</HI> become of one mind, and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf de&s;cend, in all the pomp and magnificence of heaven, per&s;onally to reign among them, and exalt his once poor, hated, de&s;pi&s;ed people to riches and ho|nours, to principality and power, and might, and dominion, and renown; and in a word, elevate his followers, as Maho|met promi&s;ed to do his, to the very &s;ummit of earthly gran|deur, and introduce them to the full fruition of all &s;en&s;ual enjoyments, and the plenary gratification of every carnal and fle&s;hly appetite. But ah, how have we been di&s;appointed! We are &s;till fed with the bread of tears, and have the water of gall to drink! We &s;ee not our &s;igns, neither is there any that can tell us how long! We have ever &s;ince been with longing eyes gazing toward the ea&s;t, but Aurora &s;till hides her ro&s;y face, not a &s;ingle blu&s;h of radiance appears to di&s;&s;ipate the nocturnal gloom; nay, we are not &s;o much as &s;atisfied that the <HI>morning &s;tar</HI> is yet ri&s;en. For though others may judge Mr. Winche&s;ter's <HI>&s;ermon</HI> to be it, yet we in Virginia rather take it to be an ominous comet, which, in&s;tead of portending pro&s;perity to the nations, forebodes &s;till greater judgments in rever&s;ion, and &s;hakes baleful influences, wars, famines, pe&s;ti|lences and de&s;olation from its horrid hair!</P>
<P>ONCE more. We u&s;ed to be taught, that none but a very &s;mall part of mankind had the lea&s;t chance of obtaining &s;al|vation at all. But now, even <HI>Judas,</HI> with the <HI>Bea&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Fal&s;e Prophet,</HI>&mdash;yea, and all the <HI>blacke&s;t fiends</HI> below, &s;hall at
<PB N="35" REF="017740_0035_0FA26A2CDCCE38C8">
la&s;t be clean&s;ed, and purified, and turned into angelic <HI>beauties,</HI> and be made equally happy with the glorious army of <HI>martyrs,</HI> and the fir&s;t born &s;ons of light! And pray, what is this but a new edition of <HI>purgatory,</HI> only a little corrected and amended? And what will follow? What but the <HI>extreme unction, prayers for the dead, Peter-pence, pilgrimages, auricular confe&s;&s;ion, par|dons, indulgences, tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, &s;upererogation,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>WE were altogether at a lo&s;s, in times pa&s;t, to know from what origin &s;uch ingenious innovations &s;prung; but this <HI>Ser|mon</HI> has obliged us with a friendly evolution of the whole my&s;tery. It is, doubtle&s;s, by the &s;uperior documents of this <HI>inherent Preacher,</HI> that the children of this generation are grown &s;o much wi&s;er than their <HI>Fathers.</HI> The author might have &s;pared his vehement ejaculation for the poor <HI>dei&s;ts</HI>; for who but this &s;upreme <HI>Pontiff</HI> taught them to e&s;py &s;o many glaring blemi&s;hes in divine revelation? And indeed he is dai|ly teaching others the noble &s;ciences of &s;elf-conceit, and the contempt of &s;erious piety, conformity to this world, &s;coffing at religion, crying up the dignity of human nature, de&s;pi&s;|ing the go&s;pel, vilifying its faithful Mini&s;ters, and pride, and wantonne&s;s, and athei&s;m, and infidelity, and profanene&s;s of every kind. And now he has brought forth a le&s;&s;on, which, if it does but &s;ucceed, will do the whole effectually. Rejoice, ye &s;ons of Belial! &s;hout loud, all ye children of di&s;obedi|ence! for that eternal <HI>hell,</HI> at which you u&s;ed to be terrified, which freqently checked you in the jovial career of vanity, that re&s;trained your corruptions, and often, often embittered your mirth, and mingled wormwood with your golden cup of plea&s;ure, that eternal <HI>hell</HI> is now no more! It is found at la&s;t to be nothing but a melancholy fiction, an idle dream, meer prie&s;tcraft, and nothing el&s;e!</P>
<P>REJOICE, ye devils, al&s;o! Yea, let all your dark dun|geons re&s;ound with the voice of jubilation! No longer need you to believe and tremble! No, no,&mdash;Wait but for a little moment, and your iron chains &s;hall bur&s;t a&s;under! Your pri|&s;on walls, though of adamant &s;hall be broken down! You &s;eraphic wings &s;hall be re&s;tored! You &s;hall regain your pri+meval velocity, and in the twinkling of an eye reach you former habitations! This is a joyful proclamation indeed But, whatever &s;ome men on earth may do, I am per&s;uade

there is not a &s;ingle devil, or damned &s;pirit in hell, that pays the lea&s;t credit thereunto. They, alas! they all know that it is an egregious <HI>fal&s;hood.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, let this doctrine be ever &s;o glorious in other peoples e&s;teem, to me it is very certain it is a doctrine that is not of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>THAT doctrine, which contradicts the plaine&s;t dictates of rea&s;on; that doctrine, which di&s;agrees with the experience of all true chri&s;tians; that doctrine, which depreciates the effica|cy, and derogates from the value of redeeming blood; that doctrine, which is directly oppo&s;ite to the whole &s;cope of di|vine revelation, which is di&s;honorable to God, and plainly tends to ruin precious &s;ouls, by encouraging them to go on in &s;in without re&s;traint; that doctrine is not, that doctrine can|not be of <HI>God.</HI> But &s;uch is this glorious (alias) inglorious doctrine of the re&s;toration, as this author holds it <HI>There|fore</HI> it is not of <HI>God.</HI> That the doctrine we have been ex|amining does evidently bear all the&s;e characters, however odious, has appeared in part already, and might ea&s;ily be made more fully to appear; but let what has been written to that purpo&s;e &s;uffice at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE <HI>author,</HI> before he fini&s;hes his appendix, tells us, he has <Q>aimed at the <HI>glory</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and the welfare of mankind, in publi&s;hing and in maintaining his doctrine.</Q> Well! what his aim was is not for me to determine, but one thing is too clear to be concealed&mdash;he has taken a very unlikely me|thod to promote either of the&s;e ends.</P>
<P>AND for my part, though I think it my duty very &s;trenu|ou&s;ly to oppo&s;e his doctrine, yet I find not the lea&s;t inclination to reproach the <HI>man,</HI> nor ca&s;t any contempt on his per&s;on. No, verily, my &s;oul loves, pities and prays for him. <HI>May God</HI> give him eyes to &s;ee his error, and grace to retract it, before it does any more mi&s;chief! For though it may a little ruffle his meek &s;pirit, we mu&s;t rank his doctrine of univer&s;al redemption among the vile&s;t of <HI>Here&s;ies.</HI> And it does really appear to be one of the mo&s;t dangerous and de&s;tructive that was ever yet propagated among mankind. Let all tho&s;e, therefore, who de&s;ire &s;alvation, beware of this inward <HI>in&s;truct|or,</HI> and at lea&s;t clo&s;ely try him, before they e&s;pou&s;e his princi|ples or embrace his tenets. Let them take heed le&s;t what

is recommended to their notice as the <HI>&s;eed</HI> of the woman &s;hould, in&s;tead of that, be nothing but the &s;erpent's head. Remember, precious <HI>&s;ouls,</HI> remember that alarming text: <HI>Sa|tan him&s;elf is transformed into an angel of light.</HI> Su&s;pect, oh &s;u&s;pect the voice of adulation. Shun, carefully &s;hun the &s;nare of the fowler, and the noi&s;ome pe&s;tilence. Take heed, le&s;t the light that is in you &s;hould prove to be darkne&s;s. Fly, quickly fly from the paths of the <HI>de&s;troyer.</HI> Ha&s;ten, oh ha&s;ten, not to the light within, but to the <HI>light</HI> without you; even to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;aves &s;inners only in this world, which is the only one that he has redeemed.
