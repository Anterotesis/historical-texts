</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>12</HI>th July.</NOTE>UPON the opening of the court this morning, <HI>Lewis</HI> moved for a rule to &s;hew cau&s;e why an at|tachment &s;hould not i&s;&s;ue again&s;t <HI>Eleazer O&s;wald,</HI> the printer and publi&s;her of the <HI>Independent Gazetieer.</HI> The ca&s;e was this: <HI>O&s;wald</HI> having in&s;erted in his new&s;papers &s;everal anonymous pieces again&s;t the cha|racter of <HI>Andrew Browne,</HI> the ma&s;ter of a female academy, in the city of Philadelphia, <HI>Browne</HI> applied to him to give up the authors of tho&s;e pieces; but being refu&s;ed that &s;a|tisfaction, he brought an action for the libel again&s;t <HI>O&s;wald,</HI> returnable into the &s;upreme court, on the 2d. day of July; and therein demanded bail for &pound;1000. Previou&s;ly to the return day of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, the que&s;tion of bail being brought by citation before Mr. Ju&s;tice BRYAN&punc; at his chambers, the Judge, on a full hearing of the cau&s;e of action, in the pre&s;ence of both the parties, ordered the defendant to be di&s;charged on common bail; and the plaintiff appeared from this order to the court. Afterwards (on the 1&s;t of July) <HI>O&s;wald</HI> publi&s;hed under his own &s;ignature, an addre&s;s to the public, which contained a narrative of the&s;e proceedings, and the following pa&s;&s;ages, which, I con|ceive, to have been the material grounds of the pre&s;ent motion.</P>
<P>"When violent attacks are made upon a per&s;on under pretext of ju&s;tice, and legal &s;teps are taken on the occa&s;ion, not perhaps to redre&s;s the &s;uppo&s;ed injury, but to feed and gratify parti&s;aning and tempori&s;ing re&s;ent|ments, it is not unwarrantable in &s;uch per&s;on to repre&s;ent the real &s;tatement of his ca&s;e, and appeal to the world for their &s;entiments and countenance.</P>
<P>"Upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, principally, I am now emboldened to tre&s;pa&s;s on the public patience, and mu&s;t &s;olicit the indul|gence of my friends and cu&s;tomers, while I pre&s;ent to their notice, an account of the &s;teps lately exerci&s;ed with me; from which it will appear that my &s;ituation <HI>as a printer,</HI> and the <HI>rights of the pre&s;s</HI> and of <HI>freemen,</HI> are fundamentally &s;truck at; and an earne&s;t endeavour is on the carpet to involve me in difficulties to plea&s;e the malicious di&s;po&s;i|tions of old and permanent enemies.</P>
<P>"But until the news had arrived la&s;t Thur&s;|day, that the <HI>ninth</HI> &s;tate had acceded to the new federal government, I was not called upon; and Mr. Page in the afternoon of that day vi&s;ited me in due form of law with a writ. Had Mr. Browne pur&s;ued me in this line, "without lo&s;s of time," agreea|bly to his lawyer's letter, I &s;hould not have &s;uppo&s;ed it extraordinary&mdash;but to arre&s;t me the moment the <HI>federal</HI> intelligence came to hand, indicated that the com|mencement of this &s;uit was not &s;o much the child of his own fancy, as it has been probably dictated to and urged on him by others, who&s;e &s;entiments upon the new con&s;titution have not in every re&s;pect coin|cided with mine. In fact, it was my idea, in the fir&s;t progre&s;s of the bu&s;ine&s;s, that Mr. Browne was merely the <HI>hand-maid</HI> of &s;ome of my enemies among the federali&s;ts; and in this cla&s;s I mu&s;t rank, his great patron Doctor <HI>Ru&s;h</HI> (who&s;e brother is a judge of the Supreme Court) I think Mr. Brown's conduct has &s;ince confirmed the idea beyond a doubt.</P>
<P>"Enemies I have had in the legal profe&s;&s;ion, and it may perhaps add to the hopes of <HI>ma|lignity,</HI> that this action is in&s;tituted in the <HI>Supreme Court</HI> of Penn&s;ylvania However, if former prejudices &s;hould be found to operate again&s;t me on the bench, it is with a jury of my country, properly elected and empannelled, a jury of freemen and inde|pendent citizens, I mu&s;t re&s;t the &s;uit. I have e&s;caped the jaws of per&s;ecution through this channel on certain memorable occa&s;ions,
<PB N="4" REF="021363_0004_0FB360F0413E92B0">
hope I &s;hall never be a &s;ufferer, let the bla&s;t of faction blow with all its furies!</P>
<P>"The doctrine of libels being a doctrine incompatible with law and liberty, and at once de&s;tructive of the privileges of a free country in the communication of our thoughts, has not hitherto gained any footing in Penn|&s;ylvania: and the vile mea&s;ures formerly taken to lay me by the heels on this &s;ubject only brought down obloquy upon the con|ductors them&s;elves. I may well &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame love of liberty yet pervades my fellow citizens, and that they will not allow the freedom of the pre&s;s to be violated upon any refined pretence, which oppre&s;&s;ive in|genuity or courtly &s;tudy caninvent.</P>
<P>"Upon trial of the cau&s;e, the public will decide for them&s;elves, whether Mr. Browne's motives have been laudable and dignified; whether his conduct in declin|ing an acquittal of his character in the paper, and &s;uing me in the mariner he did, was decent and con&s;i&s;tent; and, in a word, whe|ther he is not actuated by &s;ome of my inve|terate foes and opponents, to lend his name in their &s;ervice for the purpo&s;e of harra&s;&s;ing and injuring me."</P>
<P>A tran&s;cript from the records was read to &s;hew that the action between Browne and O&s;wald was depending in the court. <HI>James Martin</HI> proved that the paper contain|ing O&s;wald's addre&s;s, was bought at his printing office, fre&s;h and damp from the pre&s;s; and a depo&s;ition, made by <HI>Browne,</HI> was read to prove the preceding facts rela|tive to the cau&s;e of action, the hearing be|fore Mr. Ju&s;tice BRYAN, and the appeal from his order.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> then adverted to the various pieces, which were charged as libellous in the depending action; and argued, that, though the liberty of the pre&s;s was invalua|ble in its nature, and ought not to be infrin|ged; yet, that its value did not con&s;i&s;t in a boundle&s;s licentiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;lander and defamation. He contended, that the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Browne, to whom the education of more than a hundred children was &s;ome|times entru&s;ted, expo&s;ed him, in a peculiar manner, to be injured by wanton a&s;per&s;ions of his character; and he interred the nece&s;|&s;ity of the action, which had been in&s;tituted, from this con&s;ideration, that if <HI>Browne</HI> were really the mon&s;ter which the papers in que|&s;tion, de&s;cribed him to be, he ought to be hunted from &s;ociety; but, that if he had been fal&s;ely accu&s;ed, if he had been ma|liciou&s;ly traduced, it was a duty that he owed to him&s;elf and to the public, to vindicate his reputation, and to call upon the ju&s;tice of the laws, to puni&s;h &s;o gro&s;s a violation of truth and decency. For this pupo&s;e, he continued, a writ had been i&s;&s;ued, and bail was required. The defendant, if not be|fore, was, certainly, on the hearing at the Judge's chambers, apprized of the cau&s;e of action: The order of Mr. Ju&s;tice BRYAN on that occa&s;ion, and the appeal to the court, were circum&s;tances perfectly within his knowledge; and yet, while the whole merits of the cau&s;e were thus in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, he thought proper to addre&s;s the public in language evidently calculated to excite the popular re&s;entment again&s;t <HI>Browne;</HI> to create doubts and &s;u&s;picions of the integrity and impartiality of the Judges who mu&s;t pre&s;ide upon the trial; and to promote an unmerited compa&s;&s;ion in his own favour. He has de|&s;cribed him&s;elf as the object of former per|&s;ecutions upon &s;imilar principles; he has a&s;|&s;erted that, in this in&s;tance, an individual is made the in&s;trument of a party to de&s;troy him; and he artfully calls upon his fellow citizens to intere&s;t them&s;elves to pre&s;erve the freedom of the pre&s;s, which he con&s;i|ders as attacked in his per&s;on. Nay, in order to ca&s;t an odium upon the new government of the United States, he in&s;inuates, that his arre&s;t was purpo&s;ely protracted 'till the rati|fication of nine &s;tates had given &s;tability to that &s;y&s;tem:&mdash;a fal&s;ehood, as unwarrantable as it is in&s;idious; for, it will be proved that this delay took place at his own reque&s;t, communicated by Col. <HI>Proctor.</HI></P>
<P>Col. <HI>Proctor</HI> being examined on this point, &s;aid, that he, at fir&s;t, de&s;ired the action might not be brought, in hopes of accompli&s;hing a compromi&s;e between the parties; that, afterwards, he reque&s;ted Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> to de|fer i&s;&s;uing the writ 'till as near the term as it was po&s;&s;ible: but that all this interference was of his own accord, and not at the in|&s;tance of the defendant. He acknowledged, however, that he had informed <HI>O&s;wald,</HI> that the commencement of the action would be po&s;tponed as long as po&s;&s;ible, after having obtained a promi&s;e to that effect from Mr. <HI>Lewis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> &s;aid he was very much mi&s;taken indeed, if Col. <HI>Proctor</HI> had not mentioned the reque&s;t as coming from the defendant; and Col. <HI>Proctor</HI> an&s;wered,
<Q>if ever I told you &s;o, he certainly &s;ent me; but I can|not remember that ever he a&s;ked me to do a thing of the kind.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> then added, that the addre&s;s to the public manife&s;tly tended to interrupt the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice; it was an attempt to prejudice the minds of the people in a cau&s;e then depend|ing, and, by that means, to defeat the plain|iff's claim to ju&s;tice, and to &s;tigmatize the Judges, who&s;e duty it was to admini&s;ter the laws. There could be no doubt, therefore, that it amounted to a contempt of the court; and it only remained, in &s;upport of his motion, to &s;hew that an attachment was the

But <HI>Lewis</HI> oppo&s;ed the enlarge|ment of the rule, ob&s;erving that the defen|dant would be heard in extenuation, or ex|cu&s;e, of the contempt, after the attachment had i&s;&s;ued.</P>

<P>I know not of any in&s;tance where a delay of a term has been allowed in the ca&s;e of an attachment: one rea&s;on for &s;uch a &s;ummary proceeding is to prevent delay. Let cau&s;e be now &s;hewn.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Sergeant,</HI> in &s;howing cau&s;e again&s;t the at|tachment, contended that the doctrine, in 4 <HI>Black. Com.</HI> 280. was laid down much too wide; that in 2 <HI>Atk.</HI> 469, the Chancellor expre&s;sly a&s;&s;igns this rea&s;on, for his deter|mining without a jury, that he was a judge of <HI>fact;</HI> and in 1 <HI>Burr.</HI> 510&punc; 513, an infor|mation is granted on this principle, that courts of common law will not decide upon facts without the intervention of a jury.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M'KEAN, <HI>C. J.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This was not the rea&s;on that influenced tne court in their deci&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<P>But whatever the law might be in <HI>England, Sergeant</HI> in&s;i&s;ted, that it could not avail in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> Even in <HI>England,</HI> indeed, though it is &s;aid to be a contempt to report the deci&s;ions of the courts, unle&s;s under the <HI>imprimatur</HI> of the judges; yet, we find <HI>Burrow</HI> and all the &s;ub&s;equent reporters pro|ceeding without that &s;anction. But the con|&s;titution of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> authorizes many things to be done which in <HI>England</HI> are prohibited. Here the pre&s;s is laid open to the in&s;pection of every citizen, who wi&s;hes to examine the proceedings of the government; of which the judicial autho|rity is certainly to be con&s;idered as a branch. <HI>Con&s;t. Penn. &s;ect.</HI> 35.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M'KEAN, <HI>C. J.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Could not this be done in <HI>England?</HI> certainly it could: for, in &s;hort, there is nothing in the con&s;titution of this &s;tate, re&s;pecting the liberty of the pre&s;s, that has not been authorized by the con&s;titu|tion of that kingdom for near a century pa&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sergeant.</SPEAKER>
<P>The 9th <HI>&s;ection of the Bill of Rights,</HI> however, puts this &s;uppo&s;ed offence into &s;uch a form, as mu&s;t entitle the defen|dant to a trial by jury; and precludes every attempt to compel him to give evidence again&s;t him&s;elf. It declares
<Q>that in all pro&s;ecutions for <HI>criminal offences,</HI> a man hath a right to be heard by him&s;elf and his council, to demand the cau&s;e and na|ture of his accu&s;ation, to be confronted with the witne&s;&s;es, to call for evidence in his favour, and a &s;peedy public trial, <HI>by an impartial jury of the country,</HI> without the <HI>unanimous</HI> con&s;ent of which jury he cannot be found guilty; <HI>nor can he be com|pelled to give evidence again&s;t him&s;elf;</HI> nor can any man be ju&s;tly deprived of his li|berty except by the laws of the land, or the judgment of his peers.</Q>
&mdash;Now, the pre&s;ent proceeding again&s;t the defendant it for a <HI>criminal offence;</HI> and, yet, if the attach|ment i&s;&s;ues, the e&s;&s;ential parts of this &s;ection mu&s;t be defeated: for, in that ca&s;e, the de|fendant <HI>cannot be tried by a jury;</HI> and, accor|ding to the practice upon attachments, he will <HI>be compelled to an&s;wer interrogatories;</HI> in doing which, he mu&s;t either he guilty of perjury, or <HI>give evidence again&s;t him&s;elf.</HI> The proceeding by attachment is, indeed, a no|velty in this country, except for the purpo&s;e of enforcing the attendance of witne&s;&s;es. Tho&s;e contempts which are committed in the face of a court &s;tand upon a very differ|ent ground. Even the court of <HI>Admiralty</HI> (which is not a court of record) po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a power to puni&s;h them; and the rea&s;on ari&s;es from the nece&s;&s;ity, that every juri&s;diction &s;hould be competent to protect it&s;elf from immediate violence and interrup|tion. But contempts which are alledged to have been committed out of doors, are not within this rea&s;on; they come properly within the cla&s;s of <HI>criminal offences;</HI> and, as &s;uch, by the 9th <HI>&s;ect.</HI> of the bill of rights, they can only be tried by a jury.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M'KEAN, <HI>C. J.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you then appre|hend that the 9th <HI>&s;ect.</HI> of the bill of rights introduced &s;omething new on the &s;ubject of <HI>trials?</HI> I have always under&s;tood it to be the law, independent of this &s;ection, that the twelve jurors mu&s;t be <HI>unanimous</HI> in their verdict, and yet this &s;ection makes this ex|pre&s;s provi&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Sergeant</HI> &s;aid, that he had di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the &s;ub|ject as well as the little opportunity afforded him would admit. He pre&s;&s;ed the court to give further time for the argument, or, at once, to direct a trial. This he contended was, at lea&s;t, di&s;cretionary: and, con&s;idering the defendant's prote&s;tation of innocence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col. <HI>O&s;wald</HI> repeatedly declared that he meant no contempt of the court in what he had publi&s;hed.</NOTE>, his readine&s;s to give ample &s;ecurity for his future appearance, the magnitude of the que|&s;tion as ari&s;ing from the con&s;titution, and its immen&s;e con&s;equences to the public, he thought a delay, that was e&s;&s;ential to deli|beration and ju&s;tice, ought not to be refu&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Heatly</HI> and <HI>Lewis,</HI> in &s;upport of the mo|tion, contended, that under the circum&s;tan|ces

of the ca&s;e, <HI>O&s;wald</HI>'s publication, whe|ther true or fal&s;e, amounted to a contempt of the court, as it re&s;pected a cau&s;e theu de, en|ding to judgment, and reflected upon one of the Judges in his official capacity; that the argument of the adver&s;e coun&s;el went &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ert, that there could be no &s;uch offence as a contempt even in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince the very words in&s;erted in the con&s;ti|tution of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> were u&s;ed in the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of that kingdom; that, in truth, neither the bill of rights nor the con|&s;titution extended to the ca&s;e of <HI>contempts,</HI> for they meant only to &s;ecure to every citi|zen the right of expre&s;&s;ing his &s;entiments with a manly freedom, but not to authorize wanton attacks upon private reputation, or to deprive the court of a power e&s;&s;ential to its own exi&s;tence, and to the due admi|ni&s;tration of ju&s;tice; that the court were as competent to judge of the fact and the law, upon the in&s;pection of the publication in que&s;tion, as <HI>the chanceilor</HI> was in the autho|rity cited from <HI>Atkins;</HI> and that although the pro&s;ecutor could, perhaps, proceed either by indictment or information, yet that the abu&s;es of the <HI>Star Chamber</HI> had rendered the proce&s;s by information odious, and an at|tachment, which was &s;anctified by imme|morial u&s;age, was the mo&s;t expeditious, and, therefore, the mo&s;t proper remedy for the evil complained of.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M'KEAN, <HI>C. J.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;This is a motion for an attachment again&s;t <HI>Eleazer O&s;wald,</HI> the printer and publi&s;her of the Independent Gazetteer, of the 1&s;t of July la&s;t. No. 796. As a ground for granting the attachment, it is proved, that an action for a libel had been in&s;tituted in this court, in which <HI>Andrew Browne</HI> is the plaine&s;t, and <HI>Eleazer O&s;wald</HI> the defendant; that a que&s;tion with re&s;pect to bail in that action had been agitated be|fore one of the Judges, from who&s;e order, di&s;charging the defendant on common bail, the plaintiff had appealed to the court; and that Mr. <HI>O&s;wald</HI>'s addre&s;s to the public, which is the immediate &s;ubject of com|plaint, relates to the action thus depending before us. The coun&s;el in &s;upport of their motion, have argued, that this addre&s;s was intended to prejudice the public mind upon the merits of the cau&s;e, by propagating an opinion that <HI>Browne</HI> was the in&s;trument of a party to prejudice and de&s;troy the defen|dant; that he acted under the particular in|fluence of Dr. <HI>Ru&s;a,</HI> who&s;e brother is a judge of this court; and, in &s;hort, that from the ancient prejudices of all the judges, the defendant did not &s;tand a chance of a fair trial.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;ertions and imputations of this kind are certainly calculated to defeat and di&s;cre|dit the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice Let us, therefore, enquire, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> whether they ought to be con&s;idered as a contempt of the court; and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> whether, if &s;o, the offender is puni&s;hable by attachment.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t be allowed to ob&s;erve, that libelling is a great crime, whatever &s;entiments may be entertained by tho&s;e who live by it. With re&s;pect to the heart of the libeller, it is more dark and ba&s;e than that of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, or than his who commits a midnight ar&s;on. It is true, that I may ne|ver di&s;cover the wretch who has burned my hou&s;e, or &s;et fire to my barn; but the&s;e lo&s;|&s;es are ea&s;ily reparted, and bring with them no portion of ignominy or reproach. But the attacks of the libeller admit not of this con&s;olation: the injuries which are done to character and reputation &s;eldom can be cu|red, and the mo&s;t innocent man may in a moment be deprived of his good name, upon which, perhaps, he depends for all the pro&s;perity, and all the happine&s;s of his life. To what tribunal can be then re&s;ort? how &s;hall he be tried, and by whom &s;hall he be acquitted? It is in vain to object, that tho&s;e who know him will di&s;regard the &s;lander, &s;ince the wide circulation of public prints mu&s;t render it impracticable to apply the antedote as far as the poi&s;on has been extended. Nor can it be fairly &s;aid, that the &s;ame opportunity is given to <HI>vindicate,</HI> which has been employed to <HI>de&s;ame</HI> him; for, many will read the charge, who may never &s;ee the an&s;wer; and while the object of accu&s;ation is publicly pointed at, the malicious and malignant author, re&s;ts in the di&s;honorable &s;ecurity of an anonymous &s;ig|nature Where much has been &s;aid, &s;ome|thing will be believed; and it is one of the many artifices of the libeller, to give to his charges an a&s;pect of general &s;upport, by chan|ging and multiplying the &s;tyle and name of his performances. But &s;hall &s;uch things be tran&s;acted with impunity in a tree country, and among an enlightened people?

<P>What then is the meaning of the Bill of Rights, and the Con&s;titution of <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania,</HI> when they declare, "That the free|dom of the pre&s;s &s;hall not be re&s;trained,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Declar. of Rights, <HI>&s;.</HI> 12.</NOTE> and that "the printing pre&s;&s;es &s;hall be free to every per&s;on who undertakes to examine the proceedings of the legi&s;lature, or any part of the government<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Con&s;tit. of Penn. <HI>&s;.</HI> 35.</NOTE>."

are entru&s;ted with the public bu&s;ine&s;s; and they effectually preclude any attempt to fetter the pre&s;s by the in&s;titution of a <HI>licen&s;er.</HI> The &s;ame principles were &s;ettled in <HI>England,</HI> &s;o far back as the reign of <HI>William the Third,</HI> and &s;ince that time, we all know, there has been the free&s;t animadver&s;ion upon the con|duct of the mini&s;ters of that nation. But is there any thing in the language of the con&s;titution (much le&s;s in its &s;pirit and in|tention) which authorizes one man to im|pute crimes to another, for which the law has provided the mode of trial, and the de|gree of puni&s;hment? Can it be pre&s;umed that the &s;landerous words, which, when &s;poken to a few individuals, would expo&s;e the &s;peaker to puni&s;hment, become &s;acred, by the authority of the con&s;titution, when delivered to the public through the more per|manent and diffu&s;ive medium of the pre&s;s? Or, will it be &s;aid that the con&s;titutional right to examine the proceedings of govern|ment, extends to warrant an anticipation of the acts of the legi&s;lature or the judgments of the court? and not only to authorize a candid commentary upon what has been done, but to permit every endeavour to bia&s;s and intimidate with re&s;pect to matters &s;till in &s;u&s;pen&s;e? The futility of any at|tempt to e&s;tabli&s;h a con&s;truction of this &s;ort, mu&s;t be obvious to every intelligent mind. The true liberty of the pre&s;s is amply &s;ecu|red by permitting every man to publi&s;h his opinions; but it is due to the peace and dignity of &s;ociety to enquire into the mo|tives of &s;uch publications, and to di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e which are meant for u&s;e and reformation, and with an eye &s;olely to the public good, and tho&s;e which are intended merely to delude and de&s;ame. To the lat|ter de&s;cription, it is impo&s;&s;ible that any good government &s;hould afford protection and impunity.</P>
<P>If, then, the liberty of the pre&s;s is regu|lated by any ju&s;t principle, there can be little doubt, that he, who attempts to rai&s;e a prejudice again&s;t his antagoni&s;t, in the minds of tho&s;e that mu&s;t ultimately deter|mine the di&s;pute between them; who, for that purpo&s;e, repre&s;ents him&s;elf as a per&s;e|cuted man, and a&s;&s;erts that his judges are influenced by pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice,&mdash;wil|fully &s;eeks to corrupt the &s;ource, and to di&s;honor the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Such is evidently the object and tendency of Mr <HI>O&s;wald</HI>'s addre&s;s to the public. Nor can that artifice prevail, which in&s;inuates that the deci&s;ion of this court will be the effect of per&s;onal re&s;entment; for, if it could, every man might evade the puni&s;hment due to his offences, by fir&s;t pouring a torrent of abu&s;e upon his judges, and then a&s;&s;erting that they act from pa&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e their treatment has been &s;uch as would naturally excite re&s;entment in the human di&s;po&s;ition. But it mu&s;t be remembered, that judges di&s;|charge their functions under the &s;olemn obligations of an oath; and, if their virtue entitles them to their &s;tation, they can nei|ther be corrupted by favour to &s;werve from, nor influenced by fear to de&s;ert their duty. That judge, indeed, who courts popularity by unworthy means, while he weakens his preten&s;ions, dimini&s;hes, likewi&s;e, the chance of attaining his object; and he will eventu|ally find that he has &s;acrificed the &s;ub&s;tantial ble&s;&s;ing of a good con&s;cience, in an idle and vi&s;ionary pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we con&s;ider the publi|cation in que&s;tion, as having the tendency which has been a&s;cribed to it, that of pre|judicing the public (a part of whom mu&s;t hereafter be &s;ummoned as jurors) with re|&s;pect to the merits of a cau&s;e depending in this court, and of corrupting the admini&s;tra|tion of ju&s;tice: We are, therefore, unani|mou&s;ly of opinion, on the fir&s;t point, that it amounts to a contempt.</P>
<P>It only remains then to con&s;ider, whether the offence is puni&s;hable in the way that the pre&s;ent motion has propo&s;ed. It is certain that the proceeding by <HI>attachment</HI> is as old as the law it&s;elf, and no act of the legi&s;la|ture, or &s;ection of the con&s;titution, has in|terpo&s;ed to alter or &s;u&s;pend it. Be&s;ides the &s;ections which have been already read from the con&s;titution, there is another &s;ection which declares, that "trials by jury &s;hall be "as <HI>heretofore;</HI>" and &s;urely it cannot be con|tended, that the offence, with which the defendant is now charged, was <HI>heretofore</HI> tried by that tribunal. If a man commits an outrage in the face of the court, what is there to be tried?&mdash;what further evidence can be nece&s;&s;ary to convict him of the offence, than the actual view of the Judges? A man has been compelled to enter into &s;ecurity for his good behaviour, for giving the lie in the pre&s;ence of the Judges in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter Hall.</HI> On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, is not the proof, from the in&s;pection of the paper, as full and &s;atisfactory as any that can be of|fered? And whether the publication a|mounts to a contempt, or not, is a point of law, which, after all, it is the province of the judges, and not of the jury, to deter|mine. Being a contempt, if it is not pu|ni&s;hed immediately, how &s;hall the mi&s;chief be corrected? Leave it to the cu&s;tomary forms of a trial by jury, and the cau&s;e may be continued long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, while the party per&s;everes in his mi&s;conduct. The injurious con&s;equences might then be ju&s;tly imputed to the court, for refu&s;ing to exer|ci&s;e their legal power in preventing them.</P>

</SP>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> &s;aid, that as a mi&s;repre&s;entation had been indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread abroad re&s;pecting the conduct of the court, he thought it pro|per, at this time, conci&s;ely to &s;tate the real nature of the pre&s;ent proceedings. It has been a&s;&s;erted that the court were about to compel Mr. O&s;wald to convict him&s;elf of the offence with which he is charged: but the fact is this, that it is incumbent upon the per&s;on who &s;ugge&s;ts the contempt to prove it by di&s;intere&s;ted witne&s;&s;es; and then, indeed, the defendant is allowed by his own oath to purge and acquit him&s;elf, in &s;pite of all the te&s;timony which can po&s;&s;i|bly be produced again&s;t him. It appears clearly therefore, that Mr. O&s;wald's being called upon to an&s;wer interrogatories, is not meant to e&s;tabli&s;h his guilt (for that has been already done) but to enable him to avoid the puni&s;hment which is the con&s;e|quence of it. The court employ no com|pul&s;ion in this re&s;pect.

<P>Having ye&s;terday con&s;idered the charge again&s;t you, we were unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that it amounted to a contempt of the court. Some doubts were &s;ugge&s;ted, whether, even a contempt of the court, was puni&s;hable by attachment: but, not only my brethren and my&s;elf, but, likewi&s;e, all the judges of <HI>England,</HI> think, that without this power no court could po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t;&mdash;nay, that no <HI>contempt</HI> could, indeed, be committed again&s;t us, we &s;hould be <HI>&s;o truly contemptible.</HI> The law upon the &s;ubject is of immemorial an|tiquity; and there is not any period when it can be &s;aid to have cea&s;ed, or di&s;conti|nued. On this point, therefore, we en|tertain no doubt: but &s;ome difficulty has ari&s;en with re&s;pect to our &s;entence; for, on the one hand, we have been informed of your circum&s;tances, and on the other, we have &s;een your conduct: your circum|&s;tances are &s;mall, but your offence is great and per&s;i&s;ted in. Since, however, the que&s;tion &s;eems to re&s;olve it&s;elf into this, whether you &s;hall bend to the law, or the law &s;hall bend to you, it is our duty to determine that the former &s;hall be the ca&s;e. Upon the whole, therefore, THE COURT pronounce this &s;entence: That you pay a fine of 10l. to the commonwealth; that you be impri&s;oned for the &s;pace of one month, that is, from the 15th day of July to the 15th day of Augu&s;t next; and, afterwards, till the fine and co&s;ts are paid. &mdash;Sheriff he is in your cu&s;tody.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>SUMMARY</HI> of the <HI>PROCEEDINGS</HI> in the <HI>GENERAL ASSEMBLY</HI> of <HI>PENNSYLVANIA,</HI> upon the Complaint of Col. <HI>ELEAZER OSWALD</HI> again&s;t the <HI>JUSTICES</HI> of the <HI>SUPREME COURT.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the 5th of September 1788, Col. O&s;|wald, the defendant, pre&s;ented a memo|rial to the general a&s;&s;embly, in which he com|plained of the deci&s;ion of the &s;upreme court; &s;tated the above proceedings again&s;t him; and likewi&s;e repre&s;ented, that the Chief Ju&s;tice had directed the Jailer not to di&s;charge him, after his &s;entence was expired;&mdash;finally call|ing upon the hou&s;e to determine,
<Q>whether the Judges did not infringe the con&s;titution in <HI>direct</HI> terms in the &s;entence they had pro|nounced; and whether, of cour&s;e, they had not made them&s;elves proper objects of impeachment.</Q></P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly, having previou&s;ly appoint|ed a committee to report the order of pro|ceeding on Col. <HI>O&s;wald</HI>'s memorial, re&s;ol|ved it&s;elf into a committee of the whole, to hear the evidence in &s;upport of the char|ges exhibited. Three days were con&s;um|ed in the examination of witne&s;&s;es, dur|ing which, the preceding report was &s;ub&s;tantially proved; and it was al&s;o given in evidence, that, though the &s;entence of impri&s;onment was pronounced
<Q>for the &s;pace of one month, that is from the 15th day of July to the 15th day of Augu&s;t,</Q>
yet, that the record merely &s;tated it to be for <HI>one month</HI> (which is only 28 days in law) without taking notice of the explanatory words u&s;ed by the court; and that notwith|&s;tanding this, the CHIEF JUSTICE, when the month was expired, had, at fir&s;t, directed the Jailor not to relea&s;e Col. <HI>O&s;wald,</HI> till the morning of the 15th day of Augu&s;t; though he, afterwards, wrote to the &s;heriff, that it would be proper to di&s;charge his pri&s;oner agreeably to the record.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lewis,</HI> as a member of the hou&s;e, then delivered a very elaborate argument, in vin|dication of the conduct of the judges. It is impo&s;&s;ible to pur&s;ue this gentleman's tract of rea&s;oning, with any degree of ju&s;tice to his eloquence, or the &s;ubject in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; but it may not be unprofitable to tho&s;e who, either now or hereafter, may wi&s;h to un|der&s;tand the principles of this intere&s;ting ca&s;e, to delineate the leading features of the doctrine which he maintained.</P>
<P>He began with &s;tating the ine&s;timable character of true liberty, which is equally endangered by tyranny on the one hand, and by licentiou&s;ne&s;s upon the other. He &s;aid, it did not con&s;i&s;t in the uncontrouled power of doing whatever the will might prompt an individual to attempt; but, while it was in|dependent of arbitrary and de&s;potic rule, it was happily regulated by the laws and con&s;titution of the &s;tate. Having re&s;cued Sir <HI>William Black&s;tone,</HI> from the &s;tigma of being a <HI>courtly</HI> writer, by &s;hewing the enthu|&s;ia&s;m of that author in favour of the trial by jury, Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> referred to the celebrated <HI>Commentaries</HI> in &s;upport and illu&s;tration of his &s;entiments upon liberty. 1 <HI>Black. Com.</HI> 125. 2 <HI>Black. Com.</HI> 4 <HI>Black. Com.</HI> 3 42.</P>
<P>He then commented upon the origin, nature, and purpo&s;es of a &s;tate of &s;ociety, which, he &s;aid, was principally formed to protect the rights of individuals; and, of tho&s;e rights, he pathetically de&s;cribed, the right of en|joying a good name, to be the mo&s;t impor|tant and mo&s;t precious. He ob&s;erved, that the injuries which could be done to any other property, might be repaired; but re|putation was not only the mo&s;t valuable, but, likewi&s;e, the mo&s;t delicate of human po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions. It was the mo&s;t difficult to acquire; when acquired, it was the mo&s;t difficult to pre&s;erve; and when lo&s;t, it was never to be re|gained. If, therefore, it was not as much pro|tected, as any other right, the aged matron, and the youthful virgin, (&s;ince purity of charac|ter is the palladium of female happine&s;s) while they are fettered by the habits and expecta|tions of &s;ociety, are expo&s;ed and abandon|ed by its laws and in&s;titutions. But this evil is effectually removed, when we con&s;i|der the bill of rights as precluding any at|tempt to re&s;train the pre&s;s, and not as au|thorizing in&s;idious fal&s;hoods and anony|mous abu&s;e. The right of publication, like every other right, has, therefore, its natural and nece&s;&s;ary boundary; for, though the law allows a man the free u&s;e of his arm, or the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a weapon, yet it does not authorize him to plunge a dagger in the brea&s;t of an inoffen&s;ive neighbour.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> then proceeded to con&s;ider the immediate &s;ubject of complaint. He &s;tated it to be two-fold; 1 &s;t. That the CHIEF JUS|TICE had protracted Col. <HI>O&s;wald</HI>'s impri&s;on|ment, beyond the legal expiration of his &s;en|tence, and, 2dly. That the impri&s;onment it&s;elf, was uncon&s;titutional, illegal, and ty|rannical.</P>
<P>On the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> point, he ob&s;erved, that it was, indeed a &s;erious charge, if Col. <HI>O&s;wald</HI> could prove that a &s;ingle ju&s;tice, had arbitra|rily altered, or counteracted, the record of
<PB N="12" REF="021363_0011_0FB360FF49E10998">
the court, in order to accompli&s;h the impri|&s;onment of a citizen. But how was the charge &s;upported? The opinion given by the Chief Ju&s;tice to the Jailer, was not given in his judicial capacity; and though a paper, &s;aid to be a tran&s;cript from the records, was &s;hewn to him, yet it was not &s;ub&s;cribed by the Pro|thonotary, nor was it under the &s;eal of the court. This, therefore, could not be a &s;uf|ficient document to &s;et a&s;ide his recollection of the &s;entence; it was no legal evidence of the fact which it &s;tated, (<HI>Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. law of Ev.</HI> 23) and the little time that elap&s;ed between the opinion given to the Jailer, and the di|rections for Col.

<P>On the <HI>&s;econd</HI> point, he engaged in a long and ingenious di&s;qui&s;ition upon the nature of what is called <HI>the liberty of the pre&s;s;</HI> he repre&s;ented the &s;hackles which had been impo&s;ed upon it during the arbitrary periods of the Engli&s;h government; and thence de|duced the wi&s;dom and propriety of the pre|caution, which declares in the <HI>bill of rights,</HI> that the pre&s;s &s;hall not be &s;ubject to re&s;traint. He gave an hi&s;torical narrative of the Briti&s;h acts of parliament and proclamations, which debarred every man of the right of publica|tion without a previous licence obtained from cancers&punc; e&s;tabli&s;hed by the government, to in&s;pect and pronounce upon every literary performance; but ob&s;erved, that this op|pre&s;&s;ion (which was intended to keep the people in a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> ignorance of the conduct of their rulers) expired in the year 1694, when the dawn of true freedom ro&s;e upon that nation. 9 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, p</HI> 190.

<P>It has been a&s;&s;erted, however, that Col. <HI>O&s;wald</HI>'s addre&s;s was of a harmle&s;s texture; that is was no abu&s;e of the right of publica|tion, to which, as a citizen, he was entitled: and, in &s;hort, that in con&s;idering it as a con|tempt of the court, the judges have acted tyrannically, illegally, and uncon&s;titution|ally. But let us dive&s;t the &s;ubject of the&s;e high-&s;ounding epithets, and the rever&s;e of this a&s;&s;ertion will be evident, to every can|did and unprejudiced mind: For, &s;uch pub|lications are certainly calculated to draw the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice from the proper tri|bunals; and in their place to &s;ub&s;titute new&s;|paper altercations, in which the mo&s;t &s;kilful writer will generally prevail again&s;t all the merits of the ca&s;e. But it is moreover the duty of the judges to protect &s;uitors, not only from per&s;onal violence, but from in&s;idious attempts, to undermine their claims to law and ju&s;|tice. Hence, Lord Chancellor <HI>Hardwicke,</HI> (who was an ornament to his country, and not one of who&s;e decrees during the period of twenty years which he &s;at as chancellor, was ever rever&s;ed) has de&s;cribed three &s;orts of contempts&mdash;1&s;t. Scandalizing the court it&s;elf. 2dly. Abu&s;ing parties who are con|cerned in cau&s;es there; and 3dly. Prejudi|cing mankind again&s;t per&s;ons, before the cau&s;e is heard. 2 <HI>Atk.</HI> 471. And in 2 <HI>Ve&s;ey</HI> 520, though no reflection was ca&s;t upon the court, and the offender pleaded ignorance of the law, yet it is expre&s;sly laid down, that ignorance was not an excu&s;e, and that the rea&s;on for puni&s;hing was, not only for the &s;ake of the party injured, but al&s;o for the &s;ake of the public proceedings in the court to hinder &s;uch adverti&s;ements, which tend to propo&s;&s;e&s;s people as to tho&s;e proceedings. A &s;imilar doctrine is maintained in 1 <HI>P. Wil|liams</HI> 675. and 4 <HI>Black. Com.</HI> 282. pronounces the printing, even true, accounts of a cau&s;e depending in judgment, to be a contempt of the court.</P>
<P>But it has been &s;aid, that this cau&s;e was not depending in court, when the offence was committed, becau&s;e the addre&s;s was publi&s;hed on the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of July, and the writ again&s;t Mr. <HI>O&s;wald</HI> was not returnable 'till the <HI>&s;ucceeding day.</HI> This idea originates in an ignorance of the con&s;titution of our courts, which, in this re&s;pect, differs e&s;&s;en|tially from the con&s;titution of the courts of
<PB N="13" REF="021363_0012_0FB36100E8274FE8">
<HI>England. There</HI> all original proce&s;s i&s;&s;ues out of the Court of Chancery, and is made returnable into the King's Bench or Common Pleas; &s;o that, in truth, the writ gives the juri&s;diction, and, of cour&s;e, 'till it is return|ed, the court cannot take cognizance of the cau&s;e. <HI>Here,</HI> however, the original proce&s;s i&s;&s;ues out of the very court into which it is returnable, and is u&s;ually te&s;ted the la&s;t day of the preceeding term. It is ab&s;urd, therefore, to &s;ay that the juri&s;diction of a court, by who&s;e authority a &s;uit is actually in&s;tituted, can be thus &s;u&s;pended and par|celled out.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the addre&s;s it&s;elf, Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> annaly&s;ed its offen&s;ive parts, in order to &s;hew that it treated the judges with inde|cent opprobrium; that, in &s;ome re&s;pects, it was incon&s;i&s;tent with truth, and that, in its general operation, it was intended, and could not fail, to excite re&s;entment again&s;t <HI>Browne,</HI> the plaintiff, and compa&s;&s;ion for <HI>O&s;wald,</HI> the defendant, in the cau&s;e</P>
<P>He now proceeded to con&s;ider the <HI>mode</HI> of puni&s;hment, which formed a material part of Col. <HI>O&s;wald</HI>'s complaint; and, in &s;upport of its legality, referred, generally, to the authorities which he had already cited. He ob&s;erved that much declamation had been wa&s;ted upon this topic; and that the proceeding by <HI>attachment</HI> had been vehement|ly reprobated as the <HI>creature</HI> of the Court of <HI>Star Chamber.</HI> Though that court might have employed the proce&s;s of <HI>attachment</HI> (of which, however, he did not recollect an in&s;tance) yet, he in&s;i&s;ted, that it was idle and ab&s;urd to con&s;ider it as the <HI>creature</HI> of a juri&s;diction, who&s;e own exi&s;tence was of a much later date, than that of the &s;ubject to which we are told it gave birth. To prove this, he &s;tated that the court of <HI>Star Chamber</HI> was not in&s;tituted 'till the year 1368; that <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was confirmed, at lea&s;t, 113 years be|fore that time; and, as all the authorities concur in declaring that the proce&s;s by <HI>at|tachment</HI> is as ancient as the laws them&s;elves, and that it was confirmed by <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> its origin is con&s;equently long antecedent to that of the Court of <HI>Star Chamber.</HI> 4 <HI>Black. Com.</HI> 280.281.282.283.284.285.</P>
<P>But he argued, with great &s;trength and per&s;picuity, that the proce&s;s of <HI>attachment,</HI> which in practice was multiplied into innu|merable u&s;es, was e&s;&s;ential to the admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice; and that if the exerci&s;e of this power was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the courts them&s;elves might as well be annihilated. He repre&s;ented, that it was an e&s;tabli&s;hed prin|ciple in law, that one court could not puni&s;h a <HI>contempt</HI> committed again&s;t another; then, continued he, how &s;hall the <HI>Common Pleas</HI> repel an injury of that nature? It is not ve&s;ted with any criminal juri&s;diction; it can|not impannel a grand Jury, nor try an indict|ment; the only remedy therefore which the ca&s;e can admit, is by an <HI>attachment.</HI> He ap|plied the &s;ame rea&s;oning to the <HI>&s;upreme court;</HI> and with re&s;pect to the <HI>orphan's courts,</HI> the court of <HI>admiralty,</HI> and the courts of the <HI>regi&s;ters of wills, &amp;c.</HI> he ob&s;erved that their proceedings, according to the civil law, were totally independent of juries; and that con&s;equently if they were deprived of the proce&s;s of <HI>attachment,</HI> it was in vain for them to decide and to decree, for they would then be without any means to enforce obedience to their deci&s;ions and de|crees. Nay, he added, that, without this power, the legi&s;lature it&s;elf would be expo&s;ed to wanton in&s;ult and interruption; and that letters, &s;uch as he had received, menacing his exi&s;tence for his conduct on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, might be written and avowed with ab&s;olute impunity. He then enumera|ted many in&s;tances in which gro&s;s inju&s;tice would take place, but for the intervention of this &s;ummary proceeding. Where a &s;heriff refu&s;es, or neglects, to return a writ; or to pay money which he has received upon an execution; where an inferior court refu&s;es to tran&s;mit a record; a witne&s;s, or juryman, to attend or to be &s;worn; and where a de|fendant in <HI>ejectment</HI> refu&s;es to pay co&s;ts, after a <HI>non&s;uit,</HI> for want of a confe&s;&s;ion of lea&s;e entry and ou&s;ter;&mdash;in all the&s;e (and many other) ca&s;es he demon&s;trated, that the great, efficient remedy, was by an attachment to be i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the delinquent.</P>
<P>In tracing the antiquity of the proce&s;s by attachment, he remarked, that, it was ad|mitted to be a part of the common law by the mo&s;t authoritative writers; and that the common law was a compound of the <HI>Dani&s;h, Saxon, Norman, Pict</HI> and <HI>Civil law.</HI> 1 <HI>Black. Com.</HI> 63. As, therefore, the <HI>attachment</HI> is de|rived from the civil law, and the civil law was introduced into <HI>England</HI> by the <HI>Romans,</HI> early in the fir&s;t century, he thought it im|practicable at this day to a&s;certain its &s;ource; but in&s;i&s;ted that enough appeared to prove it to be of immemorial u&s;age, and a part of the law of the land.</P>
<P>He then adverted to the leading objection made by the advocates for Col. <HI>O&s;wald,</HI> that, however the proce&s;s of <HI>attachment</HI> might be legal in <HI>England,</HI> it was not &s;o in <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia.</HI> From a deci&s;ion in the time of Judge <HI>Kin&s;ey,</HI> he &s;hewed that, before the revolu|tion, an <HI>attachment</HI> had i&s;&s;ued for a contempt, and that the party had, in fact, an&s;wered cer|tain interrogatories filed by order of the court; &s;o that it only remained to enquire, whether
<PB N="14" REF="021363_0013_0FB36102DEBBFF08">
any alteration had been introduced by the con&s;titution of the &s;tate. In the 24th <HI>&s;ect.</HI> of that in&s;trument, it is declared that,
<Q>the <HI>&s;upreme court,</HI> and the &s;everal courts of <HI>common pleas</HI> of this commonwealth, &s;hall, <HI>be&s;ides the powers u&s;ually exerci&s;ed by &s;uch courts,</HI> have the powers of a court of chancery, &s;o far as relates, &amp;c.</Q>
Now, as it appears by the ca&s;e which occurred while Mr <HI>Kin&s;ey</HI> was chief ju&s;tice, that the power of i&s;&s;uing <HI>attachments</HI> was u&s;ually exerci&s;ed by the <HI>&s;upreme court,</HI> &s;o far from altering the law, this is a direct confirmation of the juri&s;diction of the court; for, the greater naturally includes the le&s;s; and if the court is ve&s;ted with <HI>all</HI> its former powers, by what po&s;&s;ible con&s;truc|tion can we deprive it of this? But it is an|&s;wered, that a &s;ection in the <HI>bill of rights</HI> provides, that "In all pro&s;ecutions for cri|minal offences the trial &s;hall be by jury, &amp;c." True; but the whole &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t be taken together; or, if we examine a particular part, it mu&s;t be with a recollection of the imme|diate &s;ubject to which that part relates For, otherwi&s;e, this very &s;ection might as proper|ly be brought to prove, that the judges could not be <HI>impeached</HI> (&s;ince &s;urely that is not a trial by jury) as that they have not the power of i&s;&s;uing attachments. All ca&s;es proper for a trial by jury, the bill of rights clearly meant to refer to that tribunal; but can any thing more explicitly demon&s;trate, that the framers of the con&s;titution were aware of &s;ome ca&s;es, which required another mode of proceeding, than their declaration, that "Trials &s;hall be by jury as <HI>heretofore?</HI>"&mdash;Who will a&s;&s;ert that contempts were ever &s;o tried? who will hazard an opinion, that it is po&s;&s;i|ble &s;o to try them?</P>
<P>But does not the con&s;titution of <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> further di&s;tingui&s;h between the <HI>laws of the land,</HI> and the <HI>judgment of our peers;</HI> fur|ni&s;hing a &s;triking alternative, by the disjunc|tive particle <HI>or?</HI> This very &s;entiment, ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame words, appears in the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of <HI>England;</HI> and yet <HI>Black&s;tone</HI> unequivocally informs us, that the proce&s;s of <HI>attachment</HI> was <HI>confirmed</HI> by that celebrated in&s;trument. In the 14 <HI>chap.</HI> of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> it is al&s;o &s;aid, that
<Q>no amercement &s;hall be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but by lawful men of the vicinage;</Q>
and who, that is at all acquainted with the law, or with the rea&s;on of the law, can think it po&s;&s;ible, in that ca&s;e, to pur&s;ue the <HI>generality</HI> of the expre&s;&s;ion? From the&s;e analogous principles, therefore, and the con|&s;truction of ages, we may &s;afely argue on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. But the wild and hy|pothetical interpretations, which &s;ome men have offered, would inevitably involve us in a labyrinth of error, and eventually en|danger that liberty, which they profe&s;s, and every hone&s;t citizen mu&s;t wi&s;h, to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>As to the manner of proceeding upon the <HI>attachment,</HI> the court on this occa&s;ion have fol|lowed the precedent in <HI>Mo&s;ley's rep</HI> 250. where it is liberally &s;aid, that the defendant &s;hall not be permited to be examined to bring him&s;elf into contempt; but upon proof of the contempt, he &s;hall be allowed to purge him&s;elf upon his oath.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> concluded, that the only grounds of impeachment, were bribery, corruption, gro&s;s partiality, or wilful and arbitrary oppre&s;&s;ion; and that as none of the&s;e had been proved, Col. <HI>O&s;wald</HI>'s memorial ought to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. He &s;aid, indeed, that it would be preferable to return to the &s;tate of nature, than to live in a &s;tate of &s;ociety upon the terms which that memorial pre&s;ented;&mdash;terms which left the weak and the innocent a prey to the powerful and the wicked; and which gave to fal&s;ehood and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, all that was due to freedom and to truth.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI>'s argument was clo&s;ed, Mr. <HI>Findley</HI> ro&s;e, and delivered his &s;entiments, with his u&s;ual abilities and preci&s;ion. He acknowledged, that he had received great information and plea&s;ure, from the learn|ed and eloquent &s;peech of the member who preceded him; but he thought it was unnece&s;&s;ary, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to explore the dark and di&s;tant periods of ju|ridical hi&s;tory. The rights and immunities which formed the great object of the revo|lution, he contended, were capable of an ea&s;y and unequivocal definition; they were not of &s;uch remote antiquity as to be lo&s;t even to the feelings of the people; and the con&s;titution of the &s;tate was the only proper criterion, by which they could be judged and a&s;certained. He did not, therefore, intend to pur&s;ue Mr. <HI>Lewis,</HI> in the tract of legal di&s;qui&s;ition; but, appealing confident|ly to the in&s;trument it&s;elf, he deemed it to be his duty to pronounce, that the deci&s;ion of the &s;upreme court was a deviation from the &s;pirit and the letter of the frame of govern|ment. In doing this, he ob&s;erved, that he did not mean to a&s;&s;ert, that any ground had been &s;hewn for the impeachment of the judges. But, on the contrary, he agreed with Mr. <HI>Lewis,</HI> that bribery, corruption, or a wilful and ar|bitrary infraction of the law, were the only true cau&s;es for in&s;tituting a pro&s;ecution of that nature; and his candor readily induced him to believe, that as none of the&s;e had been proved, neither did any of them actual|ly exi&s;t on this occa&s;ion. But, he &s;aid, it was due to the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of po&s;terity, that the legi&s;lature &s;hould act with that cir|cum&s;pection, &s;hould decide with that wi&s;|dom, which, leading on the one hand, to
<PB N="15" REF="021363_0014_0FB36103A90115E8">
an acquittal of the judges, did not tend, on the other, to e&s;tabli&s;h a baneful and de&s;truc|tive precedent. It was in this point of view, that the pre&s;ent proceeding pre&s;ented it&s;elf to his mind, as a matter of the greate&s;t magnitude and importance; and he &s;aid it were better far that Col. <HI>O&s;wald</HI> had &s;uffered in &s;ilence and ob&s;curity, than that the atten|tion of the legi&s;lature &s;hould be awakened, only to give additional &s;trength and autho|rity to the mi&s;taken judgment of the court.</P>
<P>That it was a mi&s;taken judgment, every man, he alledged, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a competent &s;hare of common &s;en&s;e, and under&s;tood the rules of grammar, was able to determine on a bare peru&s;al of the bill of rights and con&s;titution. With the&s;e aids, he defied all the &s;ophi&s;try of the &s;chools, and the jargon of the law, to pervert or corrupt the expli|cit language of the text; and therefore he regretted, that in li&s;tening to the ingenuity of Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI>'s paraphra&s;e, his admiration was not nece&s;&s;arily followed by conviction.</P>
<P>He then di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the 9<HI>&s;ect.</HI> of the bill of rights, which provides,
<Q>that in all pro&s;ecu|tions for criminal offences a man hath a right to be heard by him&s;elf and his council, to demand the cau&s;e and nature of his accu&s;ation, to be confronted with the witne&s;&s;es, to call for evidence in his favour, and a &s;peedy public trial, by an impartial jury of the country, without the unanimous con&s;ent of which jury he cannot be found guilty, nor can he be compelled to give evidence again&s;t him|&s;elf, nor can any man be ju&s;tly deprived of his liberty except by the laws of the land or the judgment of his peers.</Q>
He &s;aid, that in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, there was nothing ambiguous or uncertain; they contained a recapitulation of the mo&s;t valuable privileges, in the mo&s;t po&s;itive language; and they did not require to be illu&s;trated, or explained, by the <HI>Roman</HI> in&s;titutions, or the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> practice. Hither, he ob&s;erved, every man could &s;afely re&s;ort, in order to be taught the nature and extent of his rights and obliga|tions; and it would be fatal indeed to the cau&s;e of liberty, if it was once e&s;tabli&s;hed, that the technical learning of a lawyer, is nece&s;&s;ary to comprehend the principles, laid down in this great political compact be|tween the people and their rulers. Even with re&s;pect to that clau&s;e on which the pro|ceedings of the Judges are particularly vin|dicated, he did not perceive a rea&s;onable ground for the di&s;tinction that was attempt|ed; but thought, with many other characters of &s;uperior information and abilities, that the <HI>law of the land</HI> was not, in fact, contra-di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>judgment of his peers,</HI> but merely a diver&s;ity in the mode of ex|pre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame thing. He admitted, however, that ca&s;es did exi&s;t in which it was nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;ake of ju&s;tice, to empower the judges to exerci&s;e a &s;ummary authority. For outrages committed in the face of the court, for the mi&s;conduct of its officers, and for a di&s;obedience or re&s;i&s;tance of its proce&s;s, there &s;eemed, he &s;aid, to be a propriety in e&s;tabli&s;hing an immediate re|medy. But, this did not extend, in his opinion, to the ca&s;e of con&s;tructive con|tempts; to criminal offences perpetrated out of the view of the court; nor to &s;uch acts, as in their nature, did not call for a &s;udden puni&s;hment, and which, in their operation, involved a variety of facts, that a jury were only competent to inve&s;tigate and determine.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the argument offered by Mr. <HI>Lewis,</HI> that as <HI>attachments</HI> had i&s;&s;ued in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> before the revolution; and as the 24 <HI>&s;ect.</HI> of the con&s;titution, declares, that the courts &s;hall have all the powers which they u&s;ually exerci&s;ed, therefore the power of proceeding by <HI>attachment</HI> is confirmed, Mr. <HI>Findley</HI> ob&s;erved, that the fallacy of this interpretation, would be notorious, by recollecting that the la&s;t &s;entence of that very &s;ection, &s;tipulates that &s;uch powers &s;hall not be incon&s;i&s;tent with the con&s;titution. Nor would he admit the in|ference which had been drawn from the next &s;ection, that &s;ays, "trials &s;hall be by jury as <HI>heretofore;</HI> for, he &s;aid, it appeared by its context and immediate &s;ubject, that was related to the forms and modes of pro|ceeding upon the trial, and not to the ca&s;es in which the trial ought to be allowed.</P>
<P>Having expatiated, with great energy, upon the different points of the con&s;titution, which the &s;ubject brought into view; having a&s;&s;erted the right of every man to publi&s;h his &s;entiments on public proceedings; and having urged the danger of permitting the judges, by implication, to puni&s;h for offences again&s;t them&s;elves (ob&s;erving, that if it was a contempt to write, it was al&s;o a contempt to &s;peak of a cau&s;e depending in the courts) he concluded with intimating, that he &s;hould take an opportunity of &s;ubmitting a re&s;olution to the hou&s;e, which might &s;erve to avert the pernicious con&s;equences of al|lowing the ca&s;e of Col. <HI>O&s;wald</HI> to grow into precedent.</P>
<P>Mr. Fitz&s;imons, now moved the following re&s;olution.</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, That this hou&s;e, having, in a committee of the whole, gone into a full ex|amination of the charges exhibited by Ele|azer O&s;wald, of arbitrary and oppre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="16" REF="021363_0015_0FB361052AA8E9E8">
proceedings in the ju&s;tices of the &s;upreme court again&s;t the &s;aid Eleazer O&s;wald, are of opinion, that the charges are un&s;upported by the te&s;timony adduced, and, con&s;equent|ly, that there is no ju&s;t cau&s;e for impeaching the &s;aid ju&s;tices."</P>
<P>The propo&s;ition contained in this re&s;olu|tion, gave ri&s;e to a &s;hort but animated conver|&s;ation. On the one hand, it was &s;aid, that, in admitting that there was no ground of impeachment, it was not intended to concede, that the facts repre&s;ented in the memorial had not been proved: and, on the other hand, it was an&s;wered, that, if there had been proof that the memoriali&s;t, according to the complaint,
<Q>was immu|red in pri&s;on, without even the &s;hadow of a trial, for an imaginary offence,</Q>
it would have been the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of the legi&s;lature to vote for an impeachment. A compromi&s;e, at length, took place, and the committe of the whole agreed to report the following re&s;olution.</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, That the charges exhibited by Colonel Eleazer O&s;wald again&s;t the ju&s;tices of the &s;upreme court, and the te&s;timony given in &s;upport of them, are not a &s;uffi|cient ground of impeachment."</P>
<P>But when this report was called up for the deci&s;ion of the hou&s;e, it was po&s;tponed (and con&s;equently lo&s;t) on motion of Mr. Clymer, in order to introduce the re&s;olution original|ly propo&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Fitz&s;imons</HI> in the commit|tee. Mr. <HI>Findley</HI> then claimed the attention of the members, and after a judicious intro|duction, pre&s;ented the following re&s;olutions to the chair, to &s;upercede Mr. Clymer's mo|tion.</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, That the proceedings of the &s;u|preme court again&s;t Col. Eleazer O&s;wald, in puni&s;hing him by fine and impri&s;onment, at their di&s;cretion, for a con&s;tructive or im|plied contempt, not committed in the pre|&s;ence of the court, nor again&s;t any officer, or order thereof, but for writing and pub|li&s;hing improperly, or indecently, re&s;pect|ing a cau&s;e depending before the &s;upreme court, and re&s;pecting &s;ome of the judges of &s;aid court, was an uncon&s;titutional exerci&s;e of judicial power, and &s;ets an alarming precedent, of the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equence, to the citizens of this commonwealth."</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, That it be &s;pecially recom|mended to the en&s;uing General A&s;&s;embly, to define the nature and extent of contempts, and direct their puni&s;hment."</P>
<P>An intere&s;ting debate aro&s;e upon the&s;e re&s;olutions, in the cour&s;e of which, much that had been &s;aid in the committee was re|peated, and many new ideas were &s;ugge&s;ted, upon the general que&s;tion of the juri&s;diction of the court in ca&s;es of attachment. With re&s;pect to Mr. <HI>Findley</HI>'s propo&s;itions, that gentleman ably &s;upported them upon the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution, and the expedien|cy of the thing it&s;elf. But it &s;eemed to be &s;atisfactorily an&s;wered by Mr. <HI>Lewis,</HI> 1&s;t. That the legi&s;lative power is confined to <HI>ma|king</HI> the law, and cannot interfere in the <HI>inter|pretation;</HI> which is the natural and exclu&s;ive province of the judicial branch of the go|vernment: and 2dly, That the recommen|dation to the &s;ucceeding a&s;&s;embly would be nugatory; for the courts of ju&s;tice derive their powers from the con&s;titution, a &s;ource paramount to the legi&s;lature; and, con&s;e|quently, what is given to them by the for|mer, cannot be taken from them by the latter.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Findley</HI>'s motions were lo&s;t by a con|&s;iderable majority; and Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ymer</HI>'s revived re&s;olution, adopted by the hou&s;e:</P>
<P>Yeas 34. Nays 23.</P>
<P>Thus terminated a bu&s;ine&s;s which for &s;e|veral weeks agitated the public mind; and which was con&s;idered of &s;o important a na|ture, that the GENERAL ASSEMBLY of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> at the very clo&s;e of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions of their political exi&s;tence, and while &s;olicited by a multiplicity of other objects of great national concern, devoted all their attention to hear the evidence with impartiality, to di&s;cu&s;s the arguments with candor, and to decide upon the merits with integrity and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Of the advantages derived from this &s;cru|tiny, the mo&s;t apparent, and the mo&s;t immedi|ately intere&s;ting, are the certainty which it has given to a title of the law, not, perhaps, &s;ufficiently under&s;tood before; and the te&s;ti|mony which it has &s;upplied in favor of tho&s;e who are enru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and who&s;e characters, like the cha&s;tity of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s wife, &s;hould be free even from &s;u&s;|picion. But there is another point of view, in which the patriotic eye will regard the beneficial influence of the&s;e tran&s;actions; for, when we behold the legi&s;lative authority of the &s;tate, li&s;tening, as in an act of duty, to the complaints of an individual citizen again&s;t a &s;i&s;ter branch of the government, and not only able, but willing, to redre&s;s any wrongs that have been &s;u&s;tained; the emotions of gratitude and veneration will naturally &s;well the mind; every man mu&s;t feel a pride and intere&s;t in &s;upporting tho&s;e laws which &s;o amply protect him; and, while he contemplates the &s;y&s;tem of freedom under which he lives, he will at length be taught to convert a pious wi&s;h, into an effi|cient rule of action: ESTO PERPETUA!</P>
