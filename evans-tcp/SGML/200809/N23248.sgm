<HEAD>LETTERS OF HELVIDIUS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>N^o. I.</HEAD>
<P>SEVERAL pieces with the &s;ignature of PACIFICUS were lately publi&s;hed, which have been read with &s;ingular plea&s;ure and applau&s;e, by the foreign|ers and degenerate citizens among us, who hate our re|publican government, and the French revolution; whil&s;t the publication &s;eems to have been too little regarded, or too much de&s;pi&s;ed by the &s;teady friends to both.</P>
<P>Had the doctrines inculcated by the writer, with the natural con&s;equences from them, been nakedly pre&s;ented to the public, this treatment might have been proper. Their true character would then have &s;truck every eye, and been rejected by the feelings of every heart. But they offer them&s;elves to the reader in the dre&s;s of an ela|borate di&s;&s;ertation; they are mingled with a few truths that may &s;erve them as a pa&s;&s;port to credulity; and they
<PB N="4" REF="030734_0003_0FE8CE753B86C500">are introduced with profe&s;&s;ions of anxiety for the pre&s;er|vation of pcace, for the welfare of the government, and for the re&s;pect due to the pre&s;ent head of the executive, that may prove a &s;nare to patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>In the&s;e di&s;gui&s;es they have appeared to claim the at|tention I propo&s;e to be&s;tow on them; with a view to &s;hew, from the publication it&s;elf, that under colour of vindicating an important public act, of a chief magi&s;|trate, who enjoys the confidence and love of his coun|try, principles are advanced which &s;trike at the vitals of its con&s;titution, as well as at its honor and true inte|re&s;t.</P>
<P>As it is not improbable that attempts may be made to apply in&s;inuations, which are &s;eldom &s;pared when par|ticular purpo&s;es are to be an&s;wered, to the author of the en&s;uing ob&s;ervations, it may not be improper to pre|mi&s;e, that he is a friend to the con&s;titution, that he wi&s;hes for the pre&s;ervation of peace, and that the pre|&s;ent chief magi&s;trate has not a fellow-citizen, who is pe|netrated with deeper re&s;pect for his merits, or feels a purer &s;olicitude for his glory.</P>
<P>This declaration is made with no view of courting a more favourable ear to what may be &s;aid than it de&s;erves. The &s;ole purpo&s;e of it is, to obviate imputations which might weaken the impre&s;&s;ions of truth; and which are the more likely to be re&s;orted to, in proportion as &s;olid and fair arguments may be wanting.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of the fir&s;t piece, &s;ifted from its incon|&s;i&s;tencies and its vague expre&s;&s;ions, may be thrown into the following propo&s;itions: That the powers of declaring war and making treaties are, in their nature, executive powers: That being particularly ve&s;ted by the con&s;titution in other departments, they are to be con&s;idered as excep|tions out of the general grant to the executive depart|ment: That being, as exceptions, to be con&s;trued &s;trictly, the powers not &s;trictly within them, remain with the executive: That the executive con&s;equently, as the organ of in|tercour&s;e with foreign nations, and the interpreter and
<PB N="5" REF="030734_0004_0FE8CE76D3333110">executor of treaties, and the law of nations, is autho|ri&s;ed, to expound all articles of treaties, tho&s;e involving que&s;tions of war and peace, as well as others;&mdash;to judge of the obligations of the United States to make war or not, under any <HI>ca&s;us federis</HI> or eventual operation of the contract, relating to war;&mdash;and, to pronounce the &s;tate of things re&s;ulting from the obligations of the United States, as under&s;tood by the executive: That in particular the executive had authority to judge whether in the ca&s;e of the mutual guaranty be|tween the United States and France, the former were bound by it to engage in the war: That the executive has, in pur&s;uance of that authori|ty, decided that the United States are not bound:&mdash; And, That its proclamation of the 22d of April la&s;t, is to be taken as the effect and expre&s;&s;ion of that deci|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The ba&s;is of the rea&s;oning is, we perceive, the extra|ordinary doctrine, that the powers of making war and treaties, are in their nature executive; and therefore comprehended in the general grant of executive power, where not &s;pecially and &s;trictly excepted out of the grant.</P>
<P>Let us examine this doctrine; and that we may avoid the po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;tating the writer, it &s;hall be laid down in his own words: a precaution the more nece&s;&s;a|ry, as &s;carce any thing el&s;e could outweigh the impro|bability, that &s;o extravagant a tenet &s;hould be hazarded, at &s;o early a day, in the face of the public.</P>
<P>His words are&mdash;"Two of the&s;e [exceptions and qua|lifications to the executive powers] have been already noticed&mdash;the participation of the &s;enate in the <HI>appoint|ment of officers,</HI> and the <HI>making of treaties.</HI> A <HI>third</HI> re|mains to be mentioned&mdash;the right of the legi&s;lature to <HI>declare war, and grant letters of marque and repri&s;al."</HI></P>
<P>Again&mdash;"It de&s;erves to be remarked, that as the par|ticipation of the Senate in the <HI>making treaties,</HI> and the power of the legi&s;lature to <HI>declare war,</HI> are <HI>exceptions</HI> out of the general <HI>executive power,</HI> ve&s;ted in the Pre&s;ident,
<PB N="6" REF="030734_0005_0FE8CE7E8ECA7020">they are to be coa&s;trued <HI>&s;trictly,</HI> and ought to be ex|tended no farther than is <HI>offential</HI> to their execati|on."</P>
<P>If there be any countenance to the&s;e po&s;itions, it mu&s;t be found either 1&s;t, in the writers, of authocity, on public law; or 2d, in the quality and operation of the powers to make war and treaties: or 3d, in the con&s;ti|tution of the United States.</P>
<P>It would be of little u&s;e to enter far into the fir&s;t &s;ource of information, not only becau&s;e our own rea&s;on and our own con&s;titution, are the be&s;t guides; but be|cau&s;e a ju&s;t analy&s;is and di&s;crimination of the powers of government, according to their executive, legi&s;lative and judiciary qualities are not to be expected in the works of the mo&s;t received juri&s;ts, who wrote before a criti|cal attention was paid to tho&s;e objects, and with their eyes too much on monarchical governments, where all powers are confounded in the &s;overeignty of the prince. It will be found however, I believe, that all of them, particularly Wolfius, Burlamaqui and Vattel, &s;peak of the powers to declare war, to conclude peace, and to form alliances, as among the highe&s;t acts of the &s;ove|reignty; of which the legi&s;lative power mu&s;t at lea&s;t be an integral and pre-eminent part.</P>
<P>Writers, &s;uch as Locke and Monte&s;quieu, who have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed more particularly the principles of liberty and the &s;tructure of government, lie under the &s;ame di&s;ad|vantage, of having written before the&s;e &s;ubjects were illuminated by the events and di&s;cu&s;&s;ions which di&s;tin|gui&s;h a very recent period. Both of them too are evi|dently warped by a regard to the particular government of England, to which one of them owed allegiance; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The chapter on prerogative, &s;hews how much the rea&s;on of the Philo&s;o|pher was clouded by the royali&s;m of the Engli&s;hman.</NOTE> and the other profe&s;&s;ed an admiration bordering on ido|latry. Monte&s;quieu, however, has rather di&s;tingui&s;h|ed him&s;elf by enforcing the rea&s;ons and the importance of avoiding a confu&s;ion of the &s;everal powers of govern|ment, than by enumerating and defining the powers which belong to each particular cla&s;s. And Locke, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="7" REF="030734_0006_0FE8CE802D7B2870">the early date of his work on civil govern|ment, and the example of his own government before his eyes, admits that the particular powers in que&s;tion, which, after &s;ome of the writers on public law he calls <HI>federative,</HI> are really <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> from the <HI>executive,</HI> though almo&s;t always united with it, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to be &s;eparated into di&s;tinct bands.</HI> Had he not lived under a monarchy, in which the&s;e powers were united, or had he written by the lamp which truth now pre&s;ents to lawgivers, the la&s;t ob&s;ervation would probably never have dropt from his pen. But let us quit a field of re&s;earch which is more likely to perplex than to decide, and bring the que&s;tion to other te&s;ts of which it will be more ea&s;y to judge.</P>
<P N="2">2. If we con&s;ult, for a moment, the nature and ope|ration of the two powers to declare war and make trea|ties, it will be impo&s;&s;ible not to &s;ee that they can never fall within a proper definition of executive powers. The natural province of the executive magi&s;trate is to execute laws, as that of the legi&s;lature is to make laws. All his acts, therefore, properly executive, mu&s;t pre-&s;uppo&s;e the exi&s;tence of the laws to be executed. A treaty is not an execution of laws: it does not pre-&s;uppo&s;e the exi&s;tence of laws. It is, on the contrary, to have it&s;elf the force of a <HI>law,</HI> and to be carried into <HI>execution,</HI> like all <HI>other laws</HI> by the <HI>executive magi&s;trate.</HI> To &s;ay then that the power of making treaties which are con|fe&s;&s;edly laws, belongs naturally to the department which is to execute laws, is to &s;ay, that the executive depart|ment naturally includes a legi&s;lative power. In theory, this is an ab&s;urdity,&mdash; in practice a tyranny.</P>
<P>The power to declare war is &s;ubject to &s;imilar rea|&s;oning. A declaration that there &s;hall be war, is not an execution of laws; it does not &s;uppo&s;e pre-exi&s;ting laws to be executed: it is not, in any re&s;pect, an act merely executive. It is, on the contrary, one of the mo&s;t deliberative acts that can be performed; and when performed, has the effect of <HI>repealing</HI> all the <HI>laws</HI> opera|ting in a &s;tate of peace, &s;o far as they are incon&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of war: and of <HI>enacting</HI> as a <HI>rule for the executive,</HI> a <HI>new code</HI> adapted to the relation between the
<PB N="8" REF="030734_0007_0FE8CE87AFC54750">&s;ociety and its foreign enemy. In like manner, a con|clu&s;ion of peace <HI>annuls</HI> all the <HI>laws</HI> peculiar to a &s;tate of war, and <HI>revives</HI> the general <HI>laws</HI> incident to a &s;tate of peace.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks will be &s;trengthened by adding that treaties, particularly treaties of peace, have &s;ometimes the effect of changing not only the external laws of the &s;ociety, but operate al&s;o on the internal code, which is purely municipal, and to which the legi&s;lative authority of the country is of it&s;elf competent and compleat.</P>
<P>From this view of the &s;ubject in mu&s;t be evident, that although the executive may be a convenient organ of preliminary communications with foreign governments, on the &s;ubjects of treaty or war; and the proper agent for carrying into execution the final determinations of the competent authority; yet it can have no preten&s;ions from the nature of the powers in que&s;tion compared with the nature of the executive tru&s;t, to that e&s;&s;en|tial agency which gives validity to &s;uch determina|tions.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be further evident that, if the&s;e powers be not in their nature purely legi&s;lative, they partake &s;o much more of that, than of any other quality, that under a con&s;titution leaving them to re&s;ult to their mo&s;t natural department, the legi&s;lature would be without a rival in its claim.</P>
<P>Another important inference to be noted is, that the powers of making war and treaty being &s;ub&s;tantially of a legi&s;lative, not an executive nature, the rule of inter|preting exceptions &s;trictly, mu&s;t narrow in&s;tead of en|larging executive preten&s;ions on tho&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P N="3">3. It remains to be enquired whether there be any thing in the con&s;titution it&s;elf which &s;hews that the pow|ers of making war and peace are con&s;idered as of an ex|ecutive nature, and as comprehended within a general grant of executive power.</P>
<P>It will not be pretended that this appears from any <HI>direct</HI> po&s;ition to be found in the in&s;trument.</P>
<P>If it were <HI>deducible</HI> from any particular expre&s;&s;ions it may be pre&s;umed that the publication would have &s;aved us the trouble of the re&s;earch.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="030734_0008_0FE8CE89A20CC048">
<P>Does the doctrine then re&s;ult from the actual di&s;tri|bution of powers among the &s;everal branches of the government? Or from any fair analogy between the powers of war and treaty and the enumerated powers ve&s;ted in the executive alone?</P>
<P>Let us examine.</P>
<P>In the general di&s;tribution of powers, we find that of declaring war expre&s;sly ve&s;ted in the Congre&s;s, where every other legi&s;lative power is declared to be ve&s;ted, and without any other qualification than what is com|mon to every other legi&s;lative act. The con&s;titutional idea of this power would &s;eem then clearly to be, that it is of a legi&s;lative and not an executive nature.</P>
<P>This conclu&s;ion becomes irre&s;i&s;tible, when it is re|collected, that the con&s;titution cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have placed either any power legi&s;lative in its nature, entirely among executive powers, or any power execu|tive in its nature, entirely among legi&s;lative powers, with|out charging the con&s;titution, with that kind of inter|mixture and con&s;olidation of different powers, which would violate a fundamental principle in the organiza|tion of free governments. If it were not unnece&s;&s;ary to enlarge on this topic here, it could be &s;hewn, that the con&s;titution was originally vindicated, and has been con&s;tantly expounded, with a di&s;avowal of any &s;uch in|termixture.</P>
<P>The power of treaties is ve&s;ted jointly in the Pre&s;ident and in the Senate, which is a branch of the legi&s;lature. From this arrangement merely, there can be no inference that would nece&s;&s;arily exclude the power from the exe|cutive cla&s;s: &s;ince the &s;enate is joined with the Pre&s;ident im another power, that of appointing to offices, which as far as relate to executive offices at lea&s;t, is con&s;idered as of an executive nature. Yet on the other hand, there are &s;ufficient indications that the power of trea|ties is regarded by the con&s;titution as materially dif|ferent from mere executive power, and as having more affinity to the legi&s;lative than to the executive character.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance indicating this, is the con&s;tituti|onal regulation under which the &s;enate give their con|&s;ent
<PB N="10" REF="030734_0009_0FE8CE9102B57758">in the ca&s;e of treaties. In all other ca&s;es the con|&s;ent of the body is expre&s;&s;ed by a majority of voices. In this particular ca&s;e, a concurrence of two thirds at lea&s;t is made nece&s;&s;ary, as a &s;ub&s;titute or compen&s;ation for the other branch of the legi&s;lature, which on certain occa&s;ions, could net be conventiently a party to the tran|&s;action.</P>
<P>But the conclu&s;ive circum&s;tance is, that treaties when formed according to the con&s;titutional mode, are con|&s;e&s;&s;edly to have the force and operation of <HI>laws,</HI> and are to be a rule for the courts in controver&s;ies between man and man, as much as any <HI>aber laws.</HI> They are even emphatically declared by the con&s;titution to be <Q>the &s;u|preme law of the land.</Q></P>
<P>So far the argument from the con&s;titution is preci&s;ely in oppo&s;ition to the doctrine. As little will be gained in its favour from a compari&s;on of the two powers, with tho&s;e particularly ve&s;ted in the Pre&s;ident alone.</P>
<P>As there are but &s;ew, it will be mo&s;t &s;atisfactory to re|view them one by one.</P>
<P>"The Pre&s;ident &s;hall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the mili|tia when called into the actual &s;ervice of the United States".</P>
<P>There can be no relation worth examining between this power and the general power of making treaties. And in&s;tead of being analogous to the power of decla|ring war, it affords a &s;triking illu&s;tration of the incom|patibility of the two powers in the &s;ame hands. Tho&s;e who are to <HI>conduct a war</HI> cannot in the nature of things, be proper or &s;afe judges, whether <HI>a war ought</HI> to be <HI>commenced, continued,</HI> or <HI>concluded.</HI> They are barred from the latter functions by a great principle in free government, analogous to that which &s;eparates the &s;word from the pur&s;e, or the power of executing from the power of enacting laws.</P>
<P>"He cray require the opinion in writing of the prin|cipal officers in each of the executive departments upon any &s;ubject relating to the duties of their re&s;pective of|fices; and he &s;hall have power to grant reprieves and pardon for offences again&s;t the United States, except
<PB N="11" REF="030734_0010_0FE8CE9296D788C0">in ca&s;e of impeachment." The&s;e powers can have no|thing to do with the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"The Pre&s;ident &s;hall have power to fill up vacancies that may happen during the rece&s;s of the &s;enate, by granting commi&s;&s;ions which &s;hall expire at the end of the next &s;ection." The &s;ame remark is applicable to this power, as al&s;o to that of "receiving amba&s;&s;adors, other publicmini&s;ters and con&s;uls". The particular u&s;e attempt|ed to be made of this la&s;t power will be con&s;idered in another place.</P>
<P>"He &s;hall take care that the laws &s;hall be faithfully executed and &s;hall commi&s;&s;ion all officers of the United States." To &s;ee the laws faithfully executed con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ence of the executive authority. But what rela|tion has it to the power of making treaties and war, that is, of determining what the <HI>laws &s;hall be</HI> with regard to other nations? No other certainly than what &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the powers of executing and enacting laws; no other, con&s;equently, than what forbids a coalition of the powers in the &s;ame department.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s over the few other &s;pecified functions a&s;&s;igned to the Pre&s;ident, &s;uch as that of convening the legi&s;la|ture, &amp;c. &amp;c. which cannot be drawn into the pre&s;ent que&s;tion.</P>
<P>It may be proper however to take notice of the power of removal from office, which appeans to have been ad|judged to the Pre&s;ident by the laws e&s;tablishing the exe|cutive departments; and which the writer has endea|voured to pre&s;s into his &s;ervice. To ju&s;tify any favou|rable inference from this ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be thewn, that the powers of war and treaties are of a kindred nature to the power of removal, or at lea&s;t are equally within a grant of excutive power. Nothing of this fort has been at|tempted, nor probably will be attempted. Nothing can in truth be clearer, than that no analogy, or &s;hade of analogy, can be traced between a power in the &s;upreme officer re&s;pon&s;ible for the faithful execution of the laws, to di&s;place a &s;ubaltern officer employed in the execution of the laws; and a power to make treaties, and to de|clare war, &s;uch as the&s;e have been found to be in their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ture, their operation, and their con&s;equences.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="030734_0011_0FE8CE9A8773E5E0">
<P>Thus it appears that by whatever &s;tandard we try this doctrine, it mu&s;t be condemned as no le&s;s vicious in theory than it would be dangerous in practice. It is countenanced neither by the writters on law; nor by the nature of the powers them&s;elves; nor by any general ar|rangements or particular expre&s;&s;ions, or plau&s;ible analo|gies, to be found in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Whence then can the writer have borrowed it?</P>
<P>There is but one an&s;wer to this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The power of making treaties and the power of de|claring war, are <HI>royal prerogatives</HI> in the <HI>Briti&s;h govern|ment,</HI> and are accordingly treated as <HI>Executive prerogatives</HI> by <HI>Briti&s;h commentators.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall be the more confirmed in the nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;olution of the problem, by looking back to the aera of the con&s;titution, and &s;atis&s;ying our&s;elves that the wri|ter could not have been mi&s;led by the doctrines maintain|ed by our own commentators on our own government. That I may not ramble beyond pre&s;cribed limits, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with an extract from a work which en|tered into a &s;y&s;tematic explanation and defence of the con&s;titution, and to which there has frequently been a&s;cribed &s;ome influence in conciliating the public a&s;&s;ent to the government in the form propo&s;ed. Three circum|&s;tances con&s;pire in giving weight to this cotemporary expo&s;ition. It was made at a time when no application to <HI>per&s;ons</HI> or <HI>mea&s;ures</HI> could bias: The opinion given was not tran&s;iently mentioned, but formally and critically elu|cidated: It related to a point in the con&s;titution which mu&s;t con&s;equently have been viewed as of importance in the public mind. The pa&s;&s;age relates to the power of making treaties; that of declaring war, being arranged with &s;uch obvious propriety among the legi&s;lative pow|ers, as to be pa&s;&s;ed over without particular di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<Q>Tho' &s;everal writers on the &s;ubject of govern|ment place that power <HI>(of making treaties)</HI> in the cla&s;s of <HI>Executive authorities,</HI> yet this is <HI>evidently</HI> an <HI>arbi|trary di&s;pe&s;ition.</HI> For if we attend <HI>carefully,</HI> to its ope|ration, it will be found to partake <HI>more</HI> of the <HI>legi&s;la|tive</HI> than of the <HI>executive</HI> character, though it does not
<PB N="13" REF="030734_0012_0FE8CDE40BCA66F0">&s;eem &s;trictly to fall within the definition of either of them. The e&s;&s;ence of the legi&s;lative authority, is to enact laws; or in other words, to pre&s;cribe rules for the regulation of the &s;ociety. While the execu|tion of the laws and the employment of the common de&s;ence, &s;eem to comprize <HI>all</HI> the functions of the <HI>Executive magi&s;trate.</HI> The power of making treaties is <HI>plainly</HI> neither the one nor the other. It relates neither to the execution of the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting laws, nor to the enaction of new ones, and &s;till le&s;s to an exertion of the common &s;trength. Its objects are contracts with foreign nations, which have the <HI>force of law,</HI> but derive it from the obligations of good faith. They are not rules pre&s;cribed by the &s;overeign to the &s;ubject, but agreements between &s;overeign and &s;ove|reign.

<P>THE doctrine which has been examin|ed, is pregnant with inferences and con&s;equences again&s;t which no ramparts in the con&s;titution could defend the public liberty, or &s;carcely the forms of Republican go|vernment. Were it once e&s;tabli&s;hed that the powers of war and treaty are in their nature executive; that &s;o far as they are not by &s;trict con&s;truction transferred to the legi&s;lature, they actually belong to the executive, that of cour&s;e all powers not le&s;s executive in their nature than tho&s;e powers, if not granted to the legi&s;lature, may be claimed by the executive; if granted, are to be ta|ken <HI>&s;trictly,</HI> with a re&s;iduary right in the executive; or, as will hereafter appear, perhaps claimed as a concur|rent right by the executive; and no citizen could any longer gue&s;s at the character of the government under which he lives; the mo&s;t penetrating juri&s;t would be unable to &s;can the extent of con&s;tructive prerogative.</P>
<P>Leaving however to the lei&s;ure of the reader deducti|ons which the author having omitted might not chu&s;e to own, I proceed to the examination of one, with which that liberty cannot be taken.</P>
<P>"However true it may be (&s;ays he) that the right of the legi&s;lature to declare war <HI>includes the right of judg|ing</HI> whether the legi&s;lature be under obligations to make war or not, it will not follow that the executive is <HI>in any ca&s;e</HI> excluded from a <HI>&s;imilar right</HI> of judging in the execution of its own functions."</P>
<PB N="15" REF="030734_0014_0FE8CEA450A2D1D0">
<P>A material error of the writer in this application of his doctrine lies in his &s;hrinking from its regular con|&s;equences. Had he &s;tuck to his principle in its full ex|tent, and rea&s;oned from it without re&s;traint, he would only have had to defend him&s;elf again&s;t his opponents. By yielding the great point, that the right to declare war, <HI>though to be taken &s;trictly,</HI> includes the right to judge whether the nation be under obligation to make war of not, he is compelled to defend his argument not only again&s;t others but again&s;t him&s;elf al&s;o. Ob&s;erve how he &s;truggles in his own toils.</P>
<P>He had before admitted that the right to declare war is ve&s;ted in the legi&s;lature. He here admits that the right to declare war includes the right to judge whether the United States be obliged to declaire war or not. Can the inference be avoided, that the executive in|&s;tead of having a &s;imilar right to judge, is as much excluded from the right to judge as from the right to de|clare?</P>
<P>If the right to declare war be an exception out of the general grant to the executive power; every thing in|cluded in the right mu&s;t be included in the exception; and being included in the exception, is excluded from the grant.</P>
<P>He cannot di&s;entangle him&s;elf by con&s;idering the right of the executive to judge as <HI>concurrent</HI> with that of the legi&s;lature. For if the executive have a concurrent right to judge, and the right to judge be included in (it is in fact the very e&s;&s;ence of) the right to declare, he mu&s;t go on and &s;ay that the executive has a concurrent right al&s;o to declare. And then what will he do with his other admi&s;&s;ion, that the power to declare is an exception out of the executive power.</P>
<P>Perhaps an attempt may be made to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> out of the difficulty through the words "in the execution of its functions." Here again he mu&s;t equally &s;ail.</P>
<P>Whatever difficulties may ari&s;e in defining the execu|tive authority in particular ca&s;es, there can be none <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> on an authority clearly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> by the con&s;tituti|on in another department.

<PB N="16" REF="030734_0015_0FE8CEA5E4281698"> though it may not have clearly decided in every ca&s;e what &s;hall be &s;o deemed. The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of war is expre&s;sly made a legi&s;lative function. The judging of the obligations to make war; is admitted to be in|cluded as a legi&s;lative function. Whenever then a que&s;|tion occurs whether war &s;hall be declared, or whether public &s;tipulations require it, the que&s;tion nece&s;&s;arily belongs to the department to which tho&s;e functions be|long &mdash;And no other department can be <HI>in the executive of its preper functions,</HI> if it &s;hould undertake to decide &s;uch a que&s;tion.</P>
<P>There can be no refuge again&s;t this conclu&s;ion, but in the pretext of a <HI>concurrent</HI> right in both departments to judge of the obligations to declare war, and this mu&s;t be intended by the writer when he &s;ays, "it will not &s;ollow that the executive is excluded <HI>in any ca&s;e</HI> from a <HI>&s;imilar right</HI> of judging, &amp;c."</P>
<P>As this is the ground on which the ultimate defence is to be made, and which mu&s;t either be maintained, or the works erected on it, demoli&s;hed; it will be proper to give its &s;trength a fair trial.</P>
<P>It has been &s;een that the idea of a <HI>concurrent</HI> right is at variance with other ideas advanced or admitted by the writer. Laying a&s;ide for the pre&s;ent that con&s;ide|ration, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to avoid concluding that if the executive has a concurrent right with the legi&s;lature to judge of obligations to declare war, and the right to judge be e&s;&s;entially included in the right to declare, it mu&s;t have the &s;ame right to declare as it has to judge; and by another analogy, the &s;ame right to judge of other cau&s;es of war, as of the particular cau&s;e found in a public &s;tipulation. So that whenever the executive <HI>in the cour&s;e of its functions</HI> &s;hall meet with the&s;e ca&s;es, it mu&s;t either infer an equal authority in all, or acknow|ledge its wants of authority in any.</P>
<P>If any doubt can remain, or rather if any doubt could ever have ari&s;en, which &s;ide of the alternative ought to be embraced, it can be with tho&s;e only who overlook or reject &s;ome of the mo&s;t obvious and e&s;&s;ential truths in political &s;cience.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="030734_0016_0FE8CEAED0DB46F0">
<P>The power to judge of the cau&s;es of war as involved in the power to declare war, is expre&s;ly ve&s;ted where all other legi&s;lative powers are ve&s;ted, that is, in the Con|gre&s;s of the United States: It is con&s;equently determin|ed by the coa&s;titution to be a <HI>Legi&s;lative power.</HI> New omitting the enquiry here in what re&s;pects a compound power may be partly legi&s;lative, and partly executive, and accordingly ve&s;ted <HI>partly</HI> in the one, and <HI>partly</HI> in the other department, or <HI>jointly</HI> in both; a remark u&s;ed on another occa&s;ion is equally conclu&s;ive on this, that the &s;ame power cannot belong <HI>in the whole,</HI> to <HI>both</HI> de|partments, or be peoperly &s;o ve&s;ted as to operate <HI>&s;epa|rately</HI> in <HI>each.</HI> Still more evident is it, that the &s;ame <HI>&s;pe|cific function <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> cannot po&s;&s;ibly belong to the <HI>two</HI> de|partments, and be <HI>&s;epa|rately</HI> exerci&s;eable by <HI>each.</HI></P>
<P>Legi&s;lative power may be <HI>concurrently</HI> ve&s;ted in differ|ent legi&s;lative bodies. Executive powers may be con|currently ve&s;ted in different executive magi&s;trates. In legi&s;lative acts the executive may have a participation, as in the qualified negative on the laws. In executive acts, the legi&s;lature, or at lea&s;t a branch of it, may par|ticipate, as in the appointment to offices.&mdash; Arrange|ments of this &s;ort are familiar in theory, as well as in practice. But an independent exerci&s;e of an <HI>executive act,</HI> by the legi&s;lature <HI>alone,</HI> or of a <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> act by the executive <HI>alone,</HI> one or other of which mu&s;t happen in every ca&s;e where the &s;ame act is exerci&s;eable by each, and the latter of which would happen in the ca&s;e urged by the writer, is contrary to one of the fir&s;t and be&s;t maxims of a well organized government, and ought ne|ver to be founded in a forced con&s;truction, much le&s;s in oppo&s;ition to a fair one. In&s;tances, it is true, may be di&s;covered among our&s;elves where this maxim, has not been faithfully pur&s;ued; but being generally acknowledg|ed to be errors, they confirm, rather than impeach the truth and value of the maxim.</P>
<P>It may happen al&s;o that different independent depart|ments, the legi&s;lative and executive, for example, may in the exerci&s;e of their functions, interpret the con&s;titu|tion differently, and thence lay claim each to the &s;ame
<PB N="18" REF="030734_0017_0FE8CEB067760148">power. This difference of opinion is an inconvenience not entirely to be avoided. It re&s;ults from what may be called, if it be thought fit, a <HI>concurrent</HI> right to ex|pound the con&s;titution. But <HI>this &s;pecies</HI> of concurrence is obviou&s;ly and radically different from that in que&s;tion. The former &s;uppo&s;es the con&s;titution to have given the power to one department only; and the doubt to be to which it has been given. The letter &s;uppo&s;es it to be|long to both; and that it may be exerci&s;ed by either or both, according to the cour&s;e of exigencies.</P>
<P>A concurrent authority in two independent depart|ments to perform the &s;ame function with re&s;pect to the &s;ame thing; would be as awkward in practice, as it is unnatural in theory.</P>
<P>If the legi&s;lature and executive have both a right to judge of the obligations to make war or not, it mu&s;t &s;ometimes happen, though not at pre&s;ent, that they will judge differently.&mdash;The executive may proceed to con&s;i|der the que&s;tion to day, may determine that the United States are not bound to take part in a war, and <HI>in the ex|ecution of its functions</HI> proclaim that determination to all the world. To-morrow, the legi&s;lature may follow in the con&s;ideration of the &s;ame &s;ubject, may determine that the obligations impo&s;e war on the United States, and <HI>in the execution of its functions,</HI> enter into a <HI>con&s;titu|tional declaration,</HI> expre&s;sly contradicting the <HI>con&s;titutional proclamation.</HI></P>
<P>In what light does this pre&s;ent the con&s;titution to the people who e&s;tabli&s;hed it? In what light would it pre&s;ent to the world, a nation, thus &s;peaking, through two diffe|rent organs, equally con&s;titutional and authentic, two oppo&s;ite languages, on the &s;ame &s;ubject and under the &s;ame exi&s;ting circum&s;tances?</P>
<P>But it is not with the legi&s;lative rights alone that this doctrine interferes. The rights of the judiciary may be equally invaded. For it is clear that if a right declared by the con&s;titution to be legi&s;lative, and actually ve&s;ted by it in the legi&s;lature, leaves, notwith&s;tanding a &s;imilar right in the executive whenever a ca&s;e for exerci&s;ing it occurs, <HI>in the cour&s;e of its functions</HI>; a right declared to be judiciary and ve&s;ted in that department may, on the
<PB N="19" REF="030734_0018_0FE8CEB8A3824D30">&s;ame principle, be a&s;&s;umed and exerci&s;ed by the execu|tive <HI>in the cour&s;e of its functions</HI>; and it is evident that oc|ca&s;ions and pretexts for the latter interference may be as frequent as for the former. So again the judiciary department may find equal occa&s;ions in the execution of <HI>its</HI> functions, for u&s;urping the authorities of the ex|ecutive; and the legi&s;lature for &s;tepping into the juri&s;|diction of both. And thus all the powers of government, of which a partition is &s;o carefully made among the &s;eve|ral branches, would be thrown into ab&s;olute hotchpot, and expo&s;ed to a general &s;cramble.</P>
<P>It is time however for the writer him&s;elf to be heard, in defence of his text. His comment is in the words following: "If the legi&s;lature have a right to make war on the one hand, it is on the other the duty of the executive to pre&s;erve peace, till war is declared; and in fulfilling that duty, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily po&s;&s;e&s;s a right of judging what is the nature of the obligations which the treaties of the country impo&s;e, on the government; and when in pur&s;uance of this right it has concluded that there is nothing incon&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of neutrality, it becomes both its province and its duty to enforce the laws inci|dent to that &s;tate of the nation. The executive is charg|ed with the execution of all laws, the laws of nations, as well as the municipal law which recognizes and adopts tho&s;e laws. It is con&s;equently bound, by faithfully ex|ecuting the laws of neutrality, when that is the &s;tate of the nation, to avoid giving a cau&s;e of war to foreign powers."</P>
<P>To do full ju&s;tice to this ma&s;ter piece of logic, the reader mu&s;t have the patience to follow it &s;tep by &s;tep.</P>
<P><HI>If the legi&s;lature have a right to make war on the one hand, it is on the other, the duty of the executive to pre&s;erve peace till war is declared.</HI></P>
<P>It will be ob&s;erved that here is an explicit and pe|remptory a&s;&s;ertion, that it is the <HI>duty</HI> of the executive <HI>to pre&s;erve peace</HI> till <HI>war is declared.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And in fulfilling that duty it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily po&s;&s;e&s;s a right of judging what is the nature of the obligations which the treaties of the country impo&s;e on the government</HI>: That is to
<PB N="20" REF="030734_0019_0FE8CEBA374805F8">&s;ay, in fulfilling <HI>the duty to pre&s;erve peace,</HI> it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily po&s;&s;e&s;s the right to judge whether <HI>peace ought to be pre|&s;erved</HI>; in other words <HI>whether its duty &s;hould be perform|ed.</HI> Can words expre&s;s a flatter contradiction? It is &s;elf evident that the <HI>duty</HI> in this ca&s;e is &s;o far from <HI>nece&s;&s;arily implying the right,</HI> that it <HI>nece&s;&s;arily exchudes it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And when in pur&s;uance of this right is has concluded that there is nothing in them (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ligations) incon&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of neutrality,</HI> IT BECOMES <HI>both its province and its duty to enforce the laws incident to that &s;tate of the nation.</HI></P>
<P>And what if it &s;hould conclude that there is &s;omething incon&s;i&s;tent? Is it or is it not the province and duty of the executive to enferce the &s;ame laws? Say it is, you de&s;troy the right to judge. Say it is not, you cancel the duty to obey.</P>
<P>Take this &s;entence in connection with the proced|ing and the contradictions are multiplied. Take it by it&s;elf, and it makes the right to judge and conclude whether war be obligatory, ab&s;olute, and operative, and the duty to pre&s;erve peace, &s;ubordinate and condi|tional.</P>
<P>It will have been remarked by the attentive reader that the term <HI>peace</HI> in the fir&s;t clau&s;e has been &s;ilently ex|changed in the pre&s;ent one, for the term <HI>neutrality.</HI> No|thing however is gained by &s;hifting the terms. Neutra|lity means peace, with an allu&s;ion to the circum&s;tance of other nations being at war. The term has no refe|rence to the exi&s;tence or non-exi&s;tence of treaties or alli|ances between the nation at peace and the nations at war. The laws incident to a &s;tate of neutrality, are the laws incident to a &s;tate of peace, with &s;uch circum&s;tantial modifications only as are required by the new relation of the nations at war: Until war thercfore be duly au|thori&s;ed by the United States they are as <HI>actually</HI> neutral when other nations are at war, as they are at peace (if &s;uch a di&s;tinction in the terms is to be kept up) when other nations are not at war. The exi&s;tence of <HI>eventual</HI> engagements which can only take effect on the declara|tion of the legi&s;lature, cannot, without that declaration, change the <HI>actual</HI> &s;tate of the country, any more in the
<PB N="21" REF="030734_0020_0FE8CEC0F4B03C48">eye of the executive than in the eye of the judiciary de|partment. The laws to be the guide of both, remain the &s;ame to each, and the &s;ame to both.</P>
<P>Nor would more be gained by allowing the writer to define than to &s;hift the term neutrality. For fuppo&s;e, if you plea&s;e, the exi&s;tence of obligations to join in war to be incon&s;i&s;tens with neutrality, the que&s;tion returns upon him, what laws are to be inforced by the execu|tive until effect &s;hall be given to tho&s;e obligations by the declaration of the legi&s;lature? Are they to be the laws incident to tho&s;e obligations, that is incident to war? However &s;trongly the doctrines or deductions of the writer may tend to this point, it will not be avowed. Are the laws to be enforced by the executive, then, in &s;uch a &s;tate of things, to be the <HI>&s;ame</HI> as if no &s;uch obli|gations exi&s;ted? Admit this, which you mu&s;t admit if you reject the other alternative, and the argument lands preci&s;ely were it embarked&mdash;in the po&s;ition, that it is the ab&s;olute duty of the executive in all ca&s;es to pre&s;erve peace till war is declared, not that it is "<HI>to become</HI> the province and duty of the executive" after it has con|cluded that there is nothing in tho&s;e obligations incon&s;i|&s;tent with a &s;tate of peace and neutrality. The right to judge and conclude therefore &s;o &s;olemnly maintained in the text is lo&s;t in the comment.</P>
<P>We thall &s;ee whether it can be rein&s;tated by what follows&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>The executive is charged with the execution of all laws, the laws of nations as well as the municipal law which re|cognizes and adopts tho&s;e laws. It is con&s;equently bound, by faithfully exccuting the laws of neutrality when that is the &s;tate of the nation, to avoid giving cau&s;e of war to foreign powers.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;entence is a truth, but nothing to the point in que&s;tion. The la&s;t is <HI>partly true</HI> in its proper meaning, but <HI>totally untrue</HI> in the meaning of the writer. That the execurive is bound faithfully to execute the laws of neutrality, whil&s;t tho&s;e laws continue unaltered by the competent authority, is true; but not for the rea&s;on here given, to wit; to avoid giving cau&s;e of war to foreign powers. It is bound to the faithful execution of the&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="030734_0021_0FE8CEC3DF2FC7A8">as of all other laws internal and external, by the natura of its tru&s;t and the &s;anction of its oath, even if turbu|lent citizens &s;hould confider its &s;o doing as a cau&s;e of war at home, or unfriendly nations &s;nould con&s;ider its &s;o doing, as a cau&s;e of war abroad. The duty of the ex|ceutive to pre&s;erve external peace, can no more &s;u&s;pend the force of external laws, than its duty to pre&s;erve in|ternal peace can &s;u&s;pend the force of municipal laws.</P>
<P>It is certain that a faithful execution of the laws of neutrality may tend as much in &s;ome ca&s;es, to incur war from one quarter, as in others to avoid war from other quarters. The executive mu&s;t neverthele&s;s exe|cute the laws of neutrality whil&s;t in &s;orce, and leave it to the legi&s;iature to decide whether they ought to be al|tered or not. The executive has no other di&s;cretion than to convene and give intormation to the legi&s;lature on ocea&s;ions that may demand it; and whil&s;t this di&s;ere|tion is duly exerci&s;ed the tru&s;t of the executive is &s;atis|fied, and that department is not re&s;pon&s;ible for the con|&s;equences. It could not be made re&s;pon&s;ible for them without ve&s;ting it with the legi&s;lative as well as with the executive tru&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks are obvious and conclu&s;ive, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the expre&s;&s;ion "laws of meutrality" means &s;imely what the words import, and what alone they can mean, to give force or colour to the i-ference of the writer from his own premi&s;es. As the inference it&s;elf however in its proper meaning, does not approach towards his avowed object, which is to work out a pre|rogative for the executive to judge, in common with the legi&s;lature, whether there be cau&s;e of war or not in a public obligation, it is to be pre&s;umed that "in faithful|ly executing the laws of neutrality" an exerci&s;e of that prerogative was meant to be included. On this &s;uppo|&s;ition the inference, as will have been &s;een, does not re|&s;ult from his own premi&s;es, and has been alneady &s;o am|ply di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and, it is conceived, &s;o clearly di&s;proved, that not a word more can be nece&s;&s;ary on this branch of his argument.</P>

<P>IN order to give colour to a right in the Executive to exerci&s;e the Legi&s;lative power of judging, whether there be a cau&s;e of war in a public &s;tipulation&mdash; two other arguments are &s;ubjoined by the writer to that la&s;t examined.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is &s;imply this, "It is the right and duty of the Executive to judge of and interpret tho&s;e articles of our treaties which give to France particular privileges, <HI>in order to the enforcement of tho&s;e privileges,</HI>" from which it is &s;tated as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, that the Executive has certain other rights, among which is the right in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>This argument is an&s;wered by a very obvious di&s;tinc|tion. The fir&s;t right is e&s;&s;ential to the execution of the treaty <HI>as a law in operation,</HI> and interferes with no right inve&s;ted in another Department. The &s;econd is not e&s;&s;ential to the execution of the treaty or any other law; on the contrary the article to which the right is ap|plied, cannot as has been &s;hewn, from the very nature of it be <HI>in operation</HI> as a law without a previous declara|tion of the Legi&s;lature; and all the laws to be enforced by the Executive remain in the mean time precifely the &s;ame, whatever be the di&s;po&s;ition or judgment of the Executive. This &s;econd right would al&s;o interfere with a right acknowledged to be in the Legi&s;lative Depart|ment.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="030734_0023_0FE8CECDB3F427D8">
<P>If nothing el&s;e could &s;ugge&s;t this di&s;tinction to the write, he ought to have been reminded of it by his own words "in order to the enforcement of tho&s;e pri|vileges" &mdash;Was it in order to <HI>the enforcement</HI> of the article of guaranty, that the right is a&s;cribed to the Execu|tive?</P>
<P>The other of the two arguments reduces it&s;elf into the following form: The Executive has the right to re|ceive public Mini&s;ters; this right includes the right of deciding, in the ca&s;e of a revolution, whether the new government &s;ending the Mini&s;ter, ought to be recognized or not; and this again, the right to give or refu&s;e opera|tion to pre-exi&s;ting treaties.</P>
<P>The power of the Legi&s;lature to declare war and judge of the cau&s;es for declaring it, is one of the mo&s;t expre&s;s and explicit parts of the Con&s;titution. To en|deavour to abridge or <HI>affect it</HI> by &s;trained inferences, and by hypothetical or &s;ingular occurrences, naturally waras the reader of &s;ome lurking fallacy.</P>
<P>The words of the Con&s;titution are "he (the Pre&s;i|dent) &s;hall receive Amba&s;&s;adors, other public Mini&s;ters and Con&s;uls." I &s;hall not undertake to examine what would be the preci&s;e extent and effect of this function in various ca&s;es which fancy may &s;ugge&s;t, or which time may produce. It will be more proper to ob|&s;erve in general, and every candid reader will &s;econd the ob&s;ervation, that little if any thing more was inten|ded by the clau&s;e, than to provide for a particular mode of communication, <HI>almo&s;t</HI> grown into a right among mo|dern nations; by pointing out the department of the government, mo&s;t proper for the ceremony of admitting public Mini&s;ters, of examining their credentials, and of authenticating their title to the privileges annexed to their character by the law of nations. This being the apparent de&s;ign of the Con&s;titution, it would be highly improper to magnify the function into an important pre|rogative, even where no rights of other departments could be affected by it.</P>
<P>To &s;hew that the view here given of the clau&s;e is not a new con&s;truction, invented or &s;trained for a particular occa&s;ion&mdash;I will take the liberty of recurring to the co|temporary
<PB N="25" REF="030734_0024_0FE8CED5906EE0F0">work already quoted, which contains the ob|vious and original glo&s;s put on this part of the Con&s;titu|tion by its friends and advocates.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident is al&s;o to be authori&s;ed to receive Amba&s;&s;adors and other public Mini&s;ters. This, though it has been a rich theme of declamation, is more a mat|ter of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> than of: <HI>authority.</HI> It is a circum&s;tance, that will be <HI>without con&s;equence</HI> in the admini&s;tration of the government, and it is far more convenient that it &s;hould be arranged in this manner, than that there &s;hould be a nece&s;&s;ity for convening the Legi&s;lature or one of its branches upon every arrival of a foreign Mini&s;ter, though it were merely to take the place of a departed predece&s;&s;or. Fed. Vol. II. p. 237.</P>
<P>Had it been foretold in the year 1788 when this work was publi&s;hed, that before the end of the year 1793, a writer, a&s;&s;uming the merit of being a friend to the Con|&s;titution, would appear, and gravely maintain, that this function, which was to be <HI>without con&s;equence</HI> in the ad|mini&s;tration of the government, might have the con&s;e|quence of deciding on the validity of revolutions in fa|vor of liberty, "of putting the United States in a con|dition to become an a&s;&s;ociate in war,"&mdash;nay "of laying the <HI>legi&s;lature</HI> under an <HI>obligation</HI> of <HI>declaring</HI> war," what would have been thought and &s;aid of &s;o vi&s;ionary a pro|phet?</P>
<P>The moderate opponents of the Con&s;titution would probably have di&s;owned his extravagance. By the ad|vocates of the Con&s;titution, his prediction mu&s;t have been treated as "an experiment on public credulity, dictated either by a deliberate intention to deceive, or by the overflowings of a zeal too intemperate to be ingenu|ous."</P>
<P>But how does it follow from the function to receive Amba&s;&s;adors and other public Mini&s;ters that &s;o con&s;e|quential a prerogative may be exerci&s;ed by the Execu|tive? When a foreign Mini&s;ter pre&s;ents him&s;elf, two que&s;tions immediately ari&s;e? Are his credentials from the exi&s;ting and acting government of his country? Are they properly authenticated? The&s;e que&s;tions belong of ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="26" REF="030734_0025_0FE8CED7840D3370">to the Executive; but they involve no cognizance of the que&s;tion, whether tho&s;e exerci&s;ing the govern|ment have the right along with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This be|longs to the nation, and to the nation alone, on whom the government operates. The que&s;tions before the Executive are merely que&s;tions of fact; and the Execu|tive would have preci&s;ely the &s;ame right, or rather be under the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity of deciding them, if its functi|on was &s;imply to receive <HI>without any di&s;cretion to reject</HI> public Mini&s;ters. It is evident, therefore, that if the Executive has a right to reject a public Mini&s;ter it mu&s;t be founded on &s;ome other con&s;ideration than a change in the government or the newne&s;s of the government; and con&s;equently a right to refu&s;e to acknowledge a new go|vernment cannot be implied by the right to refu&s;e a pub|lic Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>It is not denied that there may be ca&s;es in which a re&s;pect to the general principles of liberty, the effential rights of the people, or the over-ruling &s;entiments of humanity, might require a government, whether new or old, to be treated as an illegitimate de&s;poti&s;m. Such are in fact di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and admitted by the mo&s;t approved authorities. But they are great and extraordinary ca&s;es, by no means &s;ubmitted to &s;o limited an organ of the na|tional will as the Executive of the United States; and certainly not to be brought, by any torture of words, within the right to receive Amba&s;&s;adors.</P>
<P>That the authority of the Executive does not extend to que&s;tion, whether an exi&s;ting government ought to be recognized or not, will &s;till more clearly appear from an examination of the next inference of the wri|ter, to wit, that the Executive has a right to give or refu&s;e activity and operation to pre-exi&s;ting treaties.</P>
<P>If there be a principle that ought not to be que&s;tioned within the United States, it is, that every nation has a right to aboli&s;h an old government and e&s;tabli&s;h a new one. This principle is not only recorded in every public archive, written in every American heart, and &s;ealed with the blood of a ho&s;t of American martyrs; but is the only lawful tenure by which the United States hold their exi&s;tence as a nation.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="030734_0026_0FE8CEDF1D4DD8A8">
<P>It is a principle incorporated with the above, that go|vernments are e&s;tabli&s;hed for the national good and are organs of the national will.</P>
<P>From the&s;e two principles re&s;ults a third, that trea|ties formed by the government, are treaties of the na|tion, unle&s;s otherwi&s;e expre&s;&s;ed in the treaties.</P>
<P>Another con&s;equence is that a nation, by exerci&s;ing the right of changing the organ of its will, can neither di&s;engage it&s;elf from the obligations, nor forfeit the be|nefits of its treaties. This is a truth of va&s;t importance, and happily re&s;ts with &s;ufficient firmne&s;s on its own anthority. To &s;ilence or prevent cavil, I in&s;ert however, the following extracts: <Q>Since then &s;uch a treaty (a treaty not <HI>per&s;onal</HI> to the &s;overeign) directly relates to the body of the State, it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts though the form of the republic happens to be changed, and though it &s;hould be even transformed into a monarchy&mdash;For the State and the nation are always the &s;ame whatever changes are made in the form of the government&mdash;and the treaty concluded with the nation, remains in force as long as the nation exi&s;ts." Vattel, B. II. &sect; 85.&mdash; It follows that as a treaty, notwith&s;tanding the change of a democratic government into a monarchy, con|tinues in force with the new King, in like manner; if a <HI>monarchy</HI> becomes a <HI>republie,</HI> the treaty made with the King does not expire on that account, unle&s;s it was manife&s;tly per&s;onal. <BIBL>Burlam. part IV. c. IX, &sect; 16, &para; 6.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>As a change of government then makes no change in the obligations or rights of the party to a treaty, it is clear that the Executive can have no more right to &s;u&s;|pend or prevent the operation of a treaty, on account of the change, than to &s;u&s;pend or prevent the operation, where no &s;uch change has happened. Nor can it have any more right to &s;u&s;pend the operation of a treaty in force as a law, than to &s;u&s;pend the operation of any other law.</P>
<P>The logic employed by the writer on this occa&s;ion, will be be&s;t under&s;tood by accommodating to it the lan|guage of a proclamation, founded on the prerogative and policy of &s;u&s;pending the treaty with France.</P>

<P>"And whereas <HI>a treaty</HI> antecedently exi&s;ts between the United States and &s;uch nation (a nation who&s;e go|vernment has undergone a revolution) that right (the right of judging whether the new rulers ought to be recognized or not) involves the power of giving opera|tion or not to <HI>&s;uch treaty.

<PB N="29" REF="030734_0029_0FE8CEE70184B3D0">
<P>This qualification of the &s;u&s;pending power, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> reluctantly and inexplicitly made, was prudent, for two rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, becau&s;e it is pretty evident that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> rights,</HI> whether of judiciary or executive cognizance, may be carried into effect without the agency of foreign government; and therefore would not be &s;u&s;pended of cour&s;e by a rejection of that agency. Secondly, becau&s;e the judiciary, being an independent department, and acting under an oath to pur&s;ue the law of treaties as the &s;upreme law of the land, might nor readily follow the executive example, and a <HI>right</HI> in <HI>one expo&s;itor</HI> of treaties, to con&s;ider them as <HI>not in force,</HI> whil&s;t it would be the <HI>duty</HI> of <HI>another expo&s;itor</HI> to con&s;ider them as <HI>in force,</HI> would be a phaenomenon not &s;o ea&s;y to be explained. Indeed as the doctrine &s;tands qualified, it leaves the executive the right of &s;u&s;pending the law of treaties in relation to rights of one de&s;cription, without exempting it from the duty of enforcing it in relation to rights of another de&s;cription.</P>
<P>But the writer is embarked in &s;o un&s;ound an argu|ment, that he does not &s;ave the re&s;t of his inference by this &s;acrifice of one half of it. It is not true, that <HI>all public rights</HI> are of cour&s;e &s;u&s;pended by a refu&s;al to ac|knowledge the government, or even by a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the government. And in the next place, the right in que&s;tion does not follow from the nece&s;&s;ary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of public rights, in con&s;equence of a reful&s;al to acknow|ledge the government.</P>
<P>Public rights are of two &s;orts; tho&s;e which require the agency of government; tho&s;e which may be carried into effect without that agency.</P>
<P>As public rights are the rights of the nation, not of the government, it is clear that wherever they can be made good to the nation, without the office of govern|ment, they are not &s;u&s;pended by the want of an ac|knowledged government, or even by the want of an ex|i&s;ting government; and that there are important rights of this de&s;cription, will be illu&s;trated by the following ca&s;e: Suppo&s;e, that after the couclu&s;ion of the treaty of alliance between the United States and France, a party
<PB N="30" REF="030734_0030_0FE8CEE9EBFA4918">of the enemy had &s;urpri&s;ed and put to death every mem|ber of congre&s;s; that the occa&s;ion had been u&s;ed by the people of America for changing the old confederacy into &s;uch a government as now exi&s;ts, and that in the pro|gre&s;s of this revolution, an interregnum had happened. Suppo&s;e further, that during this interval, the &s;tates of South-Carolina and Georgia, or any other parts of the United States, had been attacked, and been put into evident and imminent danger of being irrecoverably loft, without the interpo&s;ition of the French arms; is it not manife&s;t, that as the Treaty is the Treaty of the United States, not of their government, the people of the United States, could not forfeit their right to the guarantee of their territory by the accidental &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of their government; and that any attempt, on the part of France, to evade the obligations of the Treaty, by pleading the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of government, or by re|fu&s;ing to acknowledge it, would ju&s;tly have been re|ceived with univer&s;al indignation, as an ignominious perfidy?</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to public rights that cannot take effect in favour of a nation without the agency of its govern|ment, it is admitted that they are &s;u&s;pended of cour&s;e where there is no government in exi&s;tence, and al&s;o by a refu&s;al to acknowledge an exi&s;ting government. But no inference in favour of <HI>a right</HI> to &s;u&s;pend the operation of Treaties, can be drawn from either ca&s;e. Where the exi&s;tence of the government is &s;u&s;pended, it is a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; it would be a ca&s;e happening without the act of the executive, and con&s;equently could prove nothing for or again&s;t the right.</P>
<P>In the other ca&s;e, to wit, of a refu&s;al by the execu|tive to recogni&s;e an <HI>exi&s;ting government,</HI> however certain it may be, that a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of &s;ome of the public rights might en&s;ue; yet it is equally certain, that the refu&s;al would be without right or authority; and that no right or authority could be implied or produced by the un|authori&s;ed act. If a right to do whatever might bear an analogy to the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of what was done without right, could be inferred from the analogy, there would be no other limit to power than the limit to its ingenuity.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="030734_0031_0FE8CEF25BE75750">
<P>It is no an&s;wer to &s;ay, that it may be doubtful whether a government does or does not exi&s;t; or doubtful which may be the exi&s;ting and acting government. The ca&s;e &s;tated by the writer is, that there are exi&s;ting rulers; that there is an acting government; but that they are <HI>new</HI> rulers; and that it is a <HI>new</HI> government. The full re|ply, however, is to repeat what has been already ob|&s;erved; that que&s;tions of this &s;ort are mere que&s;tions of fact; that as &s;uch only, they belong to the executive; that they would equally belong to the executive, if it was tied down to the reception of public mini&s;ters, with|out any di&s;cretion to receive or reject them; that where the fact appears to be, that no government exi&s;ts, the con&s;equential &s;u&s;pen&s;ion is independent of the executive; that where the fact appears to be, that the government does exi&s;t, the executive mu&s;t be governed by the fact, and can have no right or di&s;cretion, on account of the date or form of the government, to refu&s;e to acknow|ledge it, either by rejecting its public mini&s;ter, or by any other &s;tep taken on that account. If it does refu&s;e on that account, the refu&s;al is a wrongful act, and can nei|ther prove nor illu&s;trate a rightful power.</P>
<P>I have &s;pent more time on this part of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion than may appear to &s;ome, to have been requi&s;ite. But it was con&s;idered as a proper opportunity for pre&s;enting &s;ome important ideas, connected with the general &s;ub|ject, and it may be of u&s;e in &s;hewing how very &s;uper|ficially, as well as erroneou&s;ly, the writer has treated it.</P>
<P>In other re&s;pects &s;o particular an inve&s;tigation was le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary. For allowing it to be, as contended, that a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of treaties might happen from a <HI>con&s;equential</HI> operation of a right to receive public mini&s;ters, which is an <HI>expre&s;s right</HI> ve&s;ted by the con&s;titution; it could be no proof, that the &s;ame or a <HI>&s;imilar</HI> effect could be produced by the <HI>direct</HI> operation of a <HI>con&s;tructive power.</HI></P>
<P>Hence the embarra&s;&s;ments and gro&s;s contradictions of the writer in defining, and applying his ultimate infer|ence from the operation of the executive power with re|gard to public mini&s;ters.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="030734_0032_0FE8CEF40C5E36C8">
<P>As fir&s;t it exhibits an "impertant in&s;tance of the right of the executive to decide the obligation of the nation: with regard to foreign nations."</P>
<P>Ri&s;ing from that, it confers on the executive, a right "to put the United States in a condition to become an a&s;&s;ociate in war."</P>
<P>And, at its full height authori&s;es the executive "to lay the legi&s;lature under <HI>an obligation</HI> of declaring war."</P>
<P>From this towering prerogative, it &s;uddenly brings down the executive to the right of "<HI>con&s;equentially affect|ing</HI> the proper or improper exerci&s;e of the power of the legi&s;lature to declare war.</P>
<P>And then, by a caprice as unexpected as it is &s;udden, it e&s;pou&s;es the cau&s;e of the legi&s;lature; re&s;cues it from the executive right "to lay it under an <HI>obligation</HI> of de|claring war"; and a&s;&s;erts it to be "free to perform its <HI>own</HI> duties, according to its <HI>own</HI> &s;en&s;e of them," without any other controul than what it is liable to, in every other legi&s;lative act.</P>
<P>The point at which it finally &s;eems to re&s;t, is, that "the executive in the exerci&s;e of its <HI>con&s;titutional powers,</HI> may e&s;tabluh an antecedent &s;tate of things, which ought to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> in the <HI>legi&s;lative deci&s;ions;</HI>" a prerogative which will import a great deal, or nothing, according to the handle by which you take it; and which, at the &s;ame time, you can take by no handle that does not cla&s;h with &s;ome inference preceding.</P>
<P>If "by weighing in the legi&s;lative deci&s;ions" be meant having <HI>an influence</HI> on the <HI>expediency</HI> of this or that deci|&s;ion in the <HI>opinion</HI> of the legi&s;lature; this is no more than what every antecedent &s;tate of things ought to have, from whatever cau&s;e proceeding; whether from the u&s;e or abu&s;e of con&s;titutional powers, or from the exerci&s;e of con&s;titutional or a&s;&s;umed powers. In this &s;en&s;e the power to e&s;tabli&s;h an antecedent &s;tate of things is not con&s;tituted. But then it is of no u&s;e to the writer, and is al&s;o in direct contradiction to the inference, that the executive may "lay the <HI>legi&s;lature</HI> under an <HI>obligation</HI> to decide in favour of <HI>war.</HI>"</P>

<P>THE la&s;t papers compleated the view propo&s;ed to be taken of the arguments in &s;upport of the new and a&s;piring doctrine, which a&s;cribes to the execu|tive the prerogative of judging and decidiag whether there be cau&s;es of war or not, in the obligations of trea|ties; notwith&s;tanding the expre&s;s provi&s;ion in the con|&s;titution by which the legi&s;lature is made the organ of the national will, on que&s;tions whether there be or be not a cau&s;e for declaring war. If the an&s;wer to the&s;e arguments has imparted the conviction which dictated
<PB N="34" REF="030734_0034_0FE8CEFD34D44AC0">it, the reader will have pronounced, that they are gene|rally &s;uperficial, abounding in contradictions, never in the lea&s;t degree conclu&s;ive to the main point, and not unfrequently conclu&s;ive again&s;t the writer him&s;elf: whil&s;t the doctrine&mdash;that the powers of treaty and war, are in their nature executive powers&mdash;which forms the ba&s;is of tho&s;e arguments, is as indefen&s;ible and as danger|ous, as the particular doctrine to which they are appli|ed.</P>
<P>But it is not to be forgotten that the&s;e doctrines, though ever &s;o clearly di&s;proved, or ever &s;o weakly de|fended, remain before the public a &s;triking monument of the principles and views which are entertained and propagated in the community.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o to be remembered, that however the con|&s;equences flowing from &s;uch premi&s;es, may be di&s;avow|ed at this time or by this individual, we are to regard it as morally certain, that in proportion as the doctrines make their way into the creed of the government, and the acquie&s;cence of the public, every power that can be deduced from them, will be deduced, and exerci&s;ed &s;ooner or later by tho&s;e who may have an intere&s;t in &s;o doing: The character of human nature gives this &s;a|lutary warning to every &s;ober and reflecting mind. And the hi&s;tory of government, in all its forms and in every period of time, ratifies the danger. A people therefore, who are &s;o happy as to po&s;&s;e&s;s the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing of a free and defined con&s;titution, cannot be too watch|ful again&s;t the introduction, nor too critical in tracing the con&s;equences, of new principles and new con&s;truc|tions, that may remove the land marks of power.</P>
<P>Should the prerogative which has been examined, be allowed in its mo&s;t limited &s;en&s;e, to u&s;urp the public countenance, the interval would probably be very &s;hort, before it would be heard from &s;ome quarter or other, that the prerogative either amounts to nothing, or means a right to judge and conclude that the obligations of treaty impo&s;e war, as well as that they permit peace. That it is fair rea&s;oning, to &s;ay, that if the prerogative exi&s;ts at all, an <HI>operative</HI> rather than an <HI>inert</HI> character ought to be given to it.</P>

<P>With additional force, it might be &s;aid, that the exe|cutive is as much the <HI>executor</HI> as the <HI>interpreter</HI> of trea|ties: that if by virtue of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> character, it is to judge of the <HI>obligations</HI> of treaties, it is by virtue of the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> equally authori&s;ed to carry tho&s;e obligations <HI>into effect.</HI> Should there occur for example, a <HI>ca&s;us federis,</HI> claiming a military co-operation of the United States and a mili|tary force &s;hould happen to be under the command of the executive, it mu&s;t have the &s;ame right, as <HI>executor of public treaties</HI> to <HI>employ</HI> the public force, as it has in qua|lity of <HI>interproier of public treaties</HI> to decide whether it ought to be <HI>employed.</HI></P>
<P>The ca&s;e of a treaty of peace would be an auxiliary to comments of this &s;ort: It is a condition annexed to every treaty that an infraction even of an important ar|ticle, on one &s;ide, extingui&s;hes the obligations on the other: and the immediate con&s;equence of a di&s;&s;olution of a treaty of peace is a re&s;toration of a &s;tate of war. If the executive is "to decide on the obligation of the nation with regard to foreign nations"&mdash;"to pronounce the <HI>exi&s;ting condition</HI> (in the &s;en&s;e annexed by the writer) of the nation with regard to them; and to admoni&s;h the citizens of their obligations and duties as founded upon <HI>that condition</HI> of things."&mdash;"to judge what are the <HI>recibrocal rights</HI> and obligations of the United States, and of all and each of the powers at war:"&mdash;add, that if the executive moreover po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all powers relating to war <HI>not &s;trictly</HI> within the power <HI>to declare war,</HI> which any pupil of political ca&s;ui&s;try, could di&s;tingui&s;h from a mere <HI>relap&s;e</HI> into a war, that <HI>had been declared</HI>: With this &s;tore of materials and the example given of the u&s;e
<PB N="36" REF="030734_0036_0FE8A786D426B8D0">to be made of them, would it be difficult to fabricate a power in the executive to plunge the nation into war, whenever a treaty of peace might happen to be infring|ed?</P>
<P>But if any difficulty &s;hould ari&s;e, there is another mode chalked out by which the end might clearly be brought about, even without the violation of the treaty of peace; e&s;pecially if the other party &s;hould happen to change its government at the cri&s;is. The executive, in that ca&s;e, could <HI>&s;u&s;pend</HI> the treaty of peace <HI>by refu&s;ing to receive an amba&s;&s;ador</HI> from the <HI>new</HI> government, and the &s;tate of war <HI>emerges of cour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>This is a &s;ample of the u&s;e to which the extraordinary publication we are reviewing, might be turned. Some of the inferences could not be repelled at all. And the lea&s;t regular of them mu&s;t go &s;moothly down with tho&s;e, who had &s;wallowed the gro&s;s &s;ophi&s;try which wrapped up the original do&s;e.</P>
<P>Every ju&s;t view that can be taken of this &s;ubject, admoni&s;hes the public, of the nece&s;&s;ity of a rigid adhe|rence to the &s;imple, the received and the fundamental doctrine of the con&s;titution, that the power to declare war including the power of judging of the cau&s;es of war is <HI>fully</HI> and <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> ve&s;ted in the legi&s;lature; that the executive has no right, in any ca&s;e to decide the que&s;tion, whether there is or is not cau&s;e for declaring war: that the right of convening and informing Congre&s;s, when|ever &s;uch a que&s;tion &s;eems to call for a deci&s;ion, is all the right which the con&s;titution has deemed requi&s;ite or proper; and that for &s;uch, more than for any other con|tingency, this right was &s;pecially given to the execu|tive.</P>
<P>In no part of the con&s;titution is more wi&s;dom to be &s;ound than in the clau&s;e which con&s;ides the que&s;tion of war or peace to the legi&s;lature, and not to the executive department. Be&s;ide the objection to &s;uch a mixture of heterogeneous powers; the tru&s;t and the temptation would be too great for any one man: not &s;uch as nature may offer as the prodigy of many centuries, but &s;uch as may be expected in the ordinary &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of magi&s;tra|cy. War is in fact the true nur&s;e of executive aggran|dizement.
<PB N="37" REF="030734_0037_0FE8CF0E61BFE480">In war a phy&s;ical force is to be created, and it is the executive will which is to direct it. In war the public trea&s;ures are to be unlocked, and it is the execu|tive hand which is to di&s;pen&s;e them. In war the honors and emoluments of office are to be multiplied; and it is the executive patronage under which they are to be enjoyed. It is in war, finally, that laurels are to be ga|thered, and it is the executive brow they are to encircle. The &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, and mo&s;t dangerous weakne&s;&s;es of the human brea&s;t; ambition, avarice, vanity, the ho|norable or venial love of fame, are all in con&s;piracy a|gain&s;t the de&s;ire and duty of peace.</P>
<P>Hence it has grown into an axiom that the executive is the department of power mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by its propen&s;ity to war: hence it is the practice of all &s;tates, in proportion as they are free, to di&s;arm this propen&s;ity of its influence.</P>
<P>As the be&s;t prai&s;e then that can be pronounced on an executive magi&s;trate, is, that he is the friend of peace; a prai&s;e that ri&s;es in its value, as there may be a known capacity to &s;hine in war: &s;o it mu&s;t be one of the mo&s;t &s;acred duties of a free people, to mark the fir&s;t omen in the &s;ociety, of principles that may &s;timulate the hopes of other magi&s;trates of another propen&s;ity, to intrude into que&s;tions on which its gratification depends. If a free people be a wi&s;e people al&s;o, they will not forget that the danger of &s;urpri&s;e can never be &s;o great, as when the advocates for the prerogative of war, can &s;heathe it in a &s;ymbol of peace.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution has manife&s;ted a &s;imilar prudence in refu&s;ing to the executive the <HI>&s;ole</HI> power of making peace. The tru&s;t in this in&s;tance al&s;o, would be too great for the wi&s;dom, and the temptations too &s;trong for the vir|tue, of a &s;ingle citizen. The principal rea&s;ons on which the con&s;titution proceeded in its regulation of the power of treatics, including treaties of peace, are &s;o aptly furni&s;hed by the work already quoted more than once, that I &s;hall borrow another comment from that &s;ource.</P>
<P>"However proper or &s;afe it may be in a government where the executive magi&s;trate is an hereditary monarch to commit to him the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> power of making treaties,
<PB N="38" REF="030734_0038_0FE8CF1062F62648">it would be utterly un&s;afe and improper to entru&s;t that power to an elective magi&s;trate of four years duration. It has been remarked upon another occa&s;ion, and the remark is unque&s;tionably ju&s;t, that an hereditary mon|arch, though often the oppre&s;&s;or of his people, has per|&s;onally too much at &s;take in the government to be in any material danger of being corrupted by foreign powers. But that a man rai&s;ed from the &s;tation of a private citizen to the rank of chief magi&s;trate, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of but a mode|rate or &s;lender fortune, and looking forward to a period not very remote, when he may probably be obliged to return to the &s;tation from which he was taken, might &s;ometimes be under temptations to &s;acrifice his duty to his intere&s;t, which it would require &s;uperlative virtue to with&s;tand. An avaricious man might be tempted to betray the intere&s;ts of the &s;tate to the acqui&s;ition of wealth. An ambitious man might make his own ag|grandizement, by the aid of a foreign power, the price of his treachery to his con&s;tituents&mdash;The hi&s;tory of hu|man conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue, which would make it wi&s;e in a nation, to commit intere&s;ts of &s;o delicate and momentous a kind as <HI>tho&s;e which concern its intercour&s;e</HI> with the re&s;t of the world, to the <HI>&s;ole</HI> di&s;po&s;al of a magi&s;trate, created and circum&s;tanced, as would be a Pre&s;ident of the United States."</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this paper and this branch of the &s;ubject, with two reflections, which naturally ari&s;e from this view of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, that as the per&s;onal intere&s;t of an heredi|tary monarch in the government, is the <HI>only</HI> &s;ecurity a|gain&s;t the temptation incident to a commitment of the delicate and momentous intere&s;ts of the nation which concern its intercour&s;e with the re&s;t of the world, to the di&s;po&s;al of a &s;ingle magi&s;trate, it is a plain con&s;equence, that every addition that may be made to the <HI>&s;ole</HI> agency and influence of the executive, in the intercour&s;e of the nation with foreign nations, is an increa&s;e of the dange|rous temptation to which an <HI>elective and temporary</HI> ma|gi&s;trate is expo&s;ed; and an <HI>argument</HI> and <HI>advance</HI> towards
<PB N="39" REF="030734_0028_0FE8CDEA12EB71E0">the &s;ecurity afforded by the per&s;onal intere&s;ts of an <HI>here|ditary</HI> magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>Secondly, As the con&s;titution has not permitted the executive <HI>&s;ingly</HI> to conclude or judge that peace ought to be made, it might be inferred from that circum&s;tance alone, that it never meant to give it authority, <HI>&s;ingly,</HI> to judge and conclude that war ought not to be made. The tru&s;t would be preci&s;ely &s;imilar and equivalent in the two ca&s;es. The right to &s;ay that war ought not to go on, would be no greater than the right to &s;ay that war ought to begin. Every danger of error or corrupti|on, incident to &s;uch a prerogative in one ca&s;e, is inci|dent to it in the other. If the Con&s;titution therefore has deemed it un&s;afe or improper in the one ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be deemed equally &s;o in the other ca&s;e</P>

<P>HAVING &s;een that the executive has no con&s;titutional right to interfere in any que&s;tion whe|ther there be or be not a cau&s;e of war, and the exten&s;ive con&s;equences flowing from the doctrines on which a claim has been a&s;&s;erted, it remains to be enquired whe|ther the writer is better warranted in the fact which he a&s;&s;umes, namely that the proclamation of the executive has undertaken to decide the que&s;tion, whether there be a cau&s;e of war or not, in the article of guaranty be|tween the United States and France, and, in &s;o doing has exerci&s;ed the right which is claimed for that depart|ment.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to the examination of this point, it may not be ami&s;s to advert to the novelty of the phra&s;e|ology, as well as of the doctrines, expounded by this writer. The &s;ource from which the former is evidently borrowed, may enlighten our conjectures with regard to the &s;ource of the latter. It is a ju&s;t ob&s;ervation al&s;o that words have often a gradual influence on ideas, and when u&s;ed in an improper &s;en&s;e, may cover fallacies which would not otherwi&s;e e&s;cape detection.</P>
<P>I allude panicularly to his application of the term <HI>government</HI> to the <HI>executive authority alone.</HI> The Pro|clamation is "a manife&s;tation of the &s;en&s;e of the <HI>go|vernment;</HI>" why did not the <HI>government</HI> wait, &amp;c.&mdash; "The policy on the part of the <HI>government</HI> of removing
<PB N="41" REF="030734_0040_0FE8CF19CC06E350">all doubt as to <HI>its own di&s;po&s;ition</HI>" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The writer ought not in the &s;ame paper. No. VII. to have &s;aid, "Had the Pre&s;ident announced his <HI>own di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> he would have been chargeable with egoti&s;m, if not <HI>pre&s;umption.</HI></NOTE> "It was of great importance that our citizens &s;hould under&s;tand as early as po&s;&s;ible the opinion entertained by the <HI>government,</HI> &amp;c." If in addition to the re&s;t, the early manife&s;tation of <HI>the views</HI> of the <HI>government,</HI> had any effect <HI>in fixing the public opinion,</HI> &amp;c. the reader will probably be &s;truck with the reflection, that if the Proclamation really po&s;&s;e&s;ed the character, and was to have the effects, here <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to it, &s;omething more than the authority of <HI>the government,</HI> in the writer's &s;en&s;e of government, would have been a nece&s;&s;ary &s;anction to the act, and if the term "government" be removed, and that of "Pre&s;i|dent" &s;ub&s;tituted, in the &s;entences quoted, the ju&s;tice of the reflection will be felt with peculiar force. But I remark only, on the &s;ingularity of the &s;tile adopted by the writer, as &s;hewing either that the phra&s;eology of a foreign government is more familiar to him than the phra&s;eology proper to our own, or that he wi&s;hes to pro|pagate a familiarity of the former in preference to the latter. I do not know what degree of di&s;approbation others may think due to this innovation of language, but I con&s;ider it as far above a trivial critici&s;m, to ob&s;erve that it is by no means unworthy of attention, whether viewed with an eye to its probable cau&s;e, or its apparent tendency. "The government," unque&s;tionably means in the United States the whole government, not the ex|ecutive part, either exclu&s;ively, or <HI>pre-eminently</HI>; as it may do in a monarchy, where the &s;plendor of preroga|tive eclip&s;es, and the machinary of influence, directs, every other part of the government.&mdash;In the former and proper &s;en&s;e, the term has hitherto been u&s;ed in official proceedings, in public di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and in private di&s;|cour&s;e. It is as &s;hort and as ea&s;y, and le&s;s liable to mi&s;|apprehen&s;ion, to &s;ay, the Executive or the Pre&s;ident, as to &s;ay the government. In a word the new dialect could not proceed either from nece&s;&s;ity, conveniency, proprie|ty, or per&s;picuity; and being in oppo&s;ition to com|mon u&s;age, &s;o marked a fondne&s;s for it, ju&s;tifies the
<PB N="42" REF="030734_0041_0FE8CF218F4076F8">notice here taken of it. It &s;hall no longer detain me, however, from the more important &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent paper.</P>
<P>I proceed therefore to ob&s;erve that as a "Proclama|tion," in its <HI>ordinary</HI> u&s;e, is an ad re&s;s to citizens or &s;ubjects only; as it is always under&s;tood to relate to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> law <HI>actually in operation,</HI> and to be an act <HI>purely</HI> and <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> executive; there can be no implication in the <HI>name</HI> or the <HI>form</HI> of &s;uch an in&s;trument, that it was meant <HI>principally,</HI> for the information of foreign nations; far le&s;s that it related to an <HI>eventual &s;tipulation</HI> on a &s;ubject, <HI>acknowledged</HI> to be within the <HI>legi&s;lative pro|vince.</HI></P>
<P>When the writer therefore undertook to engra&s;t his new prerogative on the Proclamation, by a&s;cribing to it &s;o unu&s;ual, and unimplied a meaning, it was evidently incumbent on him to &s;hew, that the <HI>text</HI> of the in&s;tru|ment could not be &s;atisfied by any other con&s;truction than his own. Has he done this? No. What has be done? He has called the Proclamation a Proclamation of neutrality; he has put his own arbitrary meaning on that phra&s;e, and has then proceeded in his arguments and his inferences, with as much confidence, as if no que&s;tion was ever to be a&s;ked, whether the term "neu|rality" be in the Proclamation; or whether, if there, it could ju&s;tify the u&s;e he makes of it.</P>
<P>It has appeared from ob&s;ervations already made, that if the term "neutrality" was in the Proclamation, it could not avail the writer, in the pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; but the fact is no &s;uch term is to be found in it, nor any other term, of a meaning equivalent to that, in which the term neutrality is u&s;ed by him.</P>
<P>There is the le&s;s pretext, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, for hunt|ing after any latent or extraordinary object becau&s;e an obvious and legal one, is at band, to &s;atisfy the occa&s;ion on which the Proclamation i&s;&s;ued. The exi&s;tence of war among &s;everal nations with which the United States have an exten&s;ive intercour&s;e; the duty of the executive to pre&s;erve peace by enforcing its laws, whil&s;t tho&s;e laws continued in force; the danger that indi&s;creet citizens might be tempted or &s;urpri&s;ed by the cri&s;is, into unlaw|ful proceedings, tending to involve the United States in
<PB N="43" REF="030734_0042_0FE8CF2321A2D700">a war, which the competent authority might decide them to be at liberty to avoid, and which, if they &s;hould be judged not at liberty to avoid, the other party to the <HI>eventual contract,</HI> might not be willing to impo&s;e on them; there &s;urely might have been &s;ufficient grounds for the mea&s;ure pur&s;ued by the executive, and being le|gal and rational grounds, it would be wrong, if there be no nece&s;&s;ity, to look beyond them.</P>
<P>If there be any thing in the Proclamation of which the writer could have made a handle, it is the part which declares, the <HI>di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> the <HI>duty</HI> and the <HI>intere&s;t</HI> of the United States, in relation to the war exi&s;ting in Europe. As the Legi&s;lature is the only competent and con&s;titu|tional organ of the will of the nation; that is, of its di&s;po|&s;ition, its <HI>duty</HI> and its intere&s;t, in relation to a commence|ment of war, in like manner as the Pre&s;ident and Senate <HI>jointly,</HI> not the Pre&s;ident <HI>alone,</HI> are in relation to peace, after war has been commenced&mdash;I will not di&s;&s;emble my wi&s;h that a language le&s;s expo&s;ed to critici&s;m had been prefer|red; but taking the expre&s;&s;ions, in the &s;ente of the writer him&s;elf; as analogous to the language which might be proper, on the reception of a public Mini&s;ter, or any &s;imilar occa&s;ion, it is evident, that his con&s;truction can derive no &s;uccour, even from this re&s;ource.</P>
<P>If the Proclamation then does not <HI>require</HI> the con&s;truc|tion which this writer has taken the liberty of putting on it; I leave it to be decided whether the following con&s;iderations do not forbid us to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Pre|&s;ident could have intended, by that act, to embrace and prejudge the Legi&s;lative que&s;tion whether there was, or was not, under the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, a cau&s;e of war in the article of guaranty.</P>
<P>It has been &s;hewn that &s;uch an intention would have u&s;urped a prerogative not ve&s;ted in the executive, and even <HI>confe&s;&s;edly</HI> ve&s;ted in another department.</P>
<P>In exerci&s;ing the Con&s;titutional power of deciding a que&s;tion of war, the Legi&s;lature ought to be as free to decide, according to its own &s;en&s;e of the public good, on one &s;ide as on the other &s;ide. Had the Proclamation prejudged the que&s;tion on either &s;ide, and <HI>proclaimed its deci&s;ion to the world</HI>; the Legi&s;lature in&s;tead of being as free as it ought, might be thrown under the dilem|ma,
<PB N="44" REF="030734_0043_0FE8CF2B80F3E580">of either &s;acrificing its judgment to that of the exe|cutive; or by oppo&s;ing the executive judgment, of pro|ducing a relation between the two departments, extreme|ly delicate among our&s;elves, and of the wor&s;t influence on the national character and intere&s;ts abroad; a vari|ance of this nature, it will readily be perceived, would be very different from a want of conformity to the <HI>mere recommendations</HI> of the executive, in the mea&s;ures adopt|ed by the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>It does not appear that &s;uch a Proclamation could have even pleaded any call, from either of the parties at war with France, for an explanation of the light in which the guaranty was viewed&mdash;whil&s;t, indeed, no po&s;i|tive indication whatever was given of ho&s;tile purpo&s;es, it is not conceived, that any power could have decently made &s;uch an application&mdash;or if they had, that a Procla|mation, would have been either a &s;atisfactory, or an honorable an&s;wer. It could not have been &s;atisfactory, if &s;erious apprehen&s;ions were entertained, becau&s;e it would not have proceeded from that authority which alone could definitely pronounce the will of the United States on the &s;ubject. It would not have been honora|ble, becau&s;e a private diplomatic an&s;wer only is due to a private diplomatic application; and to have done &s;o much more, would have marked a pu&s;ilanimity and want of dignity in the Executive Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>But whether the executive was or was not applied to, or whatever weight be allowed to that circum&s;tance, it ought never to be pre&s;umed, that the executive would &s;o abruptly, &s;o publicly, and &s;o &s;olemnly, proceed to di&s;claim a &s;en&s;e of the contract, which the other party might con&s;ider and wi&s;h to &s;upport by di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as its true and rea&s;onable import. It is a&s;ked, indeed, in a tone that &s;ufficiently di&s;plays the &s;pirit in which the writer con&s;trues both the Proclamation and the treaty, "Did the executive &s;tand in need of the logic of a fo|reign agent to enlighten it as to the duties or the inte|re&s;ts of the nation; or was it bound to a&s;k his con&s;ent to a &s;tep which appeared to it&s;elf con&s;i&s;tent with the former, and conducive to the latter? The &s;en&s;e of trea|ties was to be learnt from the treaties them&s;elves." Had he con&s;ulted his Vattel, in&s;tead of his animo&s;ity to
<PB N="45" REF="030734_0044_0FE8CF2D161E9130">France, he would have di&s;covered that however humi|liating it might be to wait for a foreign logic, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the interpretation of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> act depending on the national authority alone, yet in the ca&s;e of a treaty, which is as much the treaty of a foreign nation, as it is ours; and in which foreign duties and rights are as much involved as ours, the &s;en&s;e of the treaty, though to be learnt from the treaty it&s;elf, is to be equally learned by both parties to it. Neither of them can have a right more than the other, to &s;ay what a particular article means; and where there is equality without a judge, con&s;ultation is as con|&s;i&s;tent with dignity as it is conducive to harmony and friend&s;hip; let Vattel however be heard on the &s;ubject. <Q>The third general maxim, or principle, on the &s;ubject of interpretation [of Treaties] is: "<HI>that neither the one nor the other of the intere&s;ted or con|tracting powers has a right to interpret the act or treaty at us plea&s;ure.</HI> For if you are at liberty to give my promi&s;e what &s;en&s;e you plea&s;e, you will have the power of obliging me to do whatever you have a mind, contrary to my intention, and beyond my real engagement: and reciprocally, <HI>If I am allowed to explain my promi&s;es as I plea&s;e, I may render them vain and illu&s;ive, by giving them a &s;en&s;e quite dif|ferent from that in which they were pre&s;ented to you, and in which you mu&s;t have taken them in accepting them.</HI><BIBL>Vat.

<P>The writer ought to have been particularly &s;en&s;ible of the improbability that a precipitate and <HI>exparte</HI> deci|&s;ion of the que&s;tion ari&s;ing under the guaranty, could have been intended by the proclamation. He had but ju&s;t gone through his undertaking, to prove that the ar|ticle of guaranty like the re&s;t of the treaty is defen&s;ive, not offen&s;ive. He had examined his books and retailed his quotations, to &s;hew that the criterion between the two kinds of war is the circum&s;tance of priority in the attack. He could not therefore but know, that according to his own principles, the que&s;tion whether the United States, were under an obligation or not to take part in the war, was a <HI>que&s;tion of fact</HI> whether the fir&s;t attack was made by France or her enemies. And to decide a que&s;tion of fact, as well as of principle, without waiting
<PB N="46" REF="030734_0045_0FE8CF33ACA31BD8">for &s;uch repre&s;entations and proofs, as the ab&s;ent and intere&s;ted party might have to prudence, would have been a proceeding contrary to the ordinary maxims of ju&s;|tice, and requiring circum&s;tances of a very peculiar na|ture, to warrant it, towards any nation. Towards a nation which could verify her claim to more than bare ju&s;tice by our own reiterated and formal acknowledg|ments, and which mu&s;t in her pre&s;ent &s;ingular and intere&s;ting &s;ituation have a peculiar &s;en&s;ibility to marks of our friend&s;hip or alienation, the impropriety of &s;uch a proceeding would be infinitely increa&s;ed, and in the fame proportion the improbability of its having taken place.</P>
<P>There are rea&s;ons of another &s;ort which would have been a bar to &s;uch a proceeding. It would have been as impolitic as it would have been unfair and unkind.</P>
<P>If France meant not to in&s;i&s;t on the guaranty, the mea&s;ure, without giving any pre&s;ent advantage, would have deprived the United States of a future claim which may be of importance to their &s;afety. It would have in&s;pired France with jealou&s;ies of a &s;ecret bias in this country toward &s;ome of her enemies, which might have left in her brea&s;t a &s;pirit of contempt and revenge of which the effects might be felt in various ways. It mu&s;t in particular have tended to in&s;pire her with a di&s;incli|nation to &s;eed our commerce with tho&s;e important ad|vantages which it already enjoys, and tho&s;e more im|portant ones, which it anxiou&s;ly contemplates. The nation that con&s;umes more of the fruits of our &s;oil than any other nation in the world, and &s;upplies the only foreign raw material of exten&s;ive u&s;e in the United States would not be unnece&s;&s;arily provoked by tho&s;e who under&s;tand the public intere&s;t, and make it their &s;tudy, as it is their intere&s;t to advance it.</P>
<P>I am aware that the common-place remark will be interpo&s;ed, that, "commercial privileges are not worth having, when not &s;ecured by mutual intere&s;t; and ne|ver worth purcha&s;ing becau&s;e they will grow of them|&s;elves out of a mutual intere&s;t." Prudent men, who do not &s;uffer their rea&s;on to be mi&s;led by their prejudi|ces will view the &s;ubject in a ju&s;ter light. They will reflect, that if commercial privileges are not worth pur|cha&s;ing, they are worth having without purcha&s;e; that
<PB N="47" REF="030734_0046_0FE8CF36E7887008">in the commerce of a great nation, there are valuable privileges which may be granted or not granted, or granted either to this or that country, without any &s;en|&s;ible influence on the intere&s;t of the nation it&s;elf; that the friendly or unfriendly di&s;po&s;ition of a country, is always an article of moment in the calculations of a com|prehen&s;ive intere&s;t: that &s;ome &s;acrifices of intere&s;t will be made to other motives: by nations as well as by individuals, though not with the &s;ame frequency, or in the &s;ame proportions, that more of a di&s;intere&s;ted con|duct or of a conduct founded on liberal views of intere&s;t, prevails in &s;ome nations than in others, that as far as can be &s;een of the influence of the revolution on the genius and the policy of France, particularly with re|gard to the United States, every thing is to be hoped by the latter on this &s;ubject, which one country can rea|&s;onably hope from another. In this point of view a greater <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> could not have been committed than in a &s;tep, that might have turned the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of France to open her commerce to us as far as a liberal calculation of her intere&s;t would permit, and her friend|&s;hip towards us, and confidence in our friend&s;hip to|wards her. could prompt, into a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;hut it as clo&s;ely again&s;t us as the united motives of intere&s;t, of di&s;tru&s;t, and of ill-will, could urge her.</P>
<P>On the &s;uppo&s;ition that France might intend to claim the guaranty, a ha&s;ty and har&s;h refu&s;al before we were a&s;ked. on a ground that accu&s;ed her of being the aggre&s;&s;or in the war again&s;t every power in the ca|talogue of her enemies, and in a cri&s;is when all her &s;en|&s;ibility mu&s;t be alive towards the United States, would have given every po&s;&s;ible irritation to a di&s;appointment which every motive that one nation could feel towards another and towards it&s;elf, required to be alleviated by all the circum&s;pection and delicacy that could be applied to the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence of the Executive &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of Spain and Portugal to the war again&s;t France throws great light on the pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Had the procla|mation been i&s;&s;ued in the &s;en&s;e, and for the purpo&s;es a&s;|cribed to it, that is to &s;ay, as a declaration of neutra|lity, another would have follouted, on that event. If it was the right and duty of the <HI>Government,</HI> that is, the <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> to manife&s;t to Great Britain and Holland;

The opinion of the Executive with re|&s;pect to a con&s;i&s;tency or incon&s;i&s;tency of neutrality with treaties in the <HI>latter ca&s;e</HI> could not be <HI>in&s;erred</HI> from the proclamation in the former, becau&s;e the <HI>circum&s;tances might be different.</HI> Taking the proclamation in its pro|per &s;en&s;e, as reminding all concerned, that as the United States were at peace (that &s;tate not being affec|ted by foreign wars, and only to be changed by the legi&s;lative authority of the country) the laws of peace were &s;till obligatory and would be enforced, and the inference is &s;o obvious and &s;o applicable to all other ca&s;es <HI>whatever circum&s;tances</HI> may di&s;tingui&s;h them, that ano|ther proclamation would be unnece&s;&s;ary. Here is a new a&s;pect of the whole &s;ubject, admoni&s;hing us in the mo&s;t &s;triking manner at once of the danger of the pre|rogative contended for, and the ab&s;urdity of the di&s;tinc|tions and arguments employed in its favour. It would be as impo&s;&s;ible in practice, as it is in theory, to &s;epa|rate the power of judging and concluding, that the ob|ligations of a treaty do not impo&s;e war from that of judging and concluding that the obligations <HI>do impo&s;e war.</HI> In certain ca&s;es, &s;ilence would proclaim the lat|ter conclu&s;ion, as intelligibly as words could do the former. The writer indeed has him&s;elf abandoned the di&s;tinction in his VIIth paper, by declaring expre&s;sly that the object of the proclamation would have been de|feated "by leaving it uncertain whether the Executive did or <HI>did not</HI> believe a &s;tate of neutrality to be con&s;i&s;|tent with our treaties".</P>
