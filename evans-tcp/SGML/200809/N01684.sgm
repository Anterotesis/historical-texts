</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_CHRIST JESUS having been Bap|tized and after that tempted of Satan for Forty days, doth in a more eminent manner enter into the execution of his Prophetical Office, and Preacheth his Sermon in the Mount contained in this and the two follow|ing Chapters. He begins his Sermon by teaching them, who are ble&s;&s;ed Men; and their in this and the next ver&s;e he teaches his Di&s;ciples what is their Office, and the work which they are to do as his Mini&s;ters. Fir&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="001998_0003_0FBA4F63E7DACA10">he tells them, they are the <HI>Salt of the Earth:</HI> Fir&s;t it may be enquired, who he &s;peaks to? Some think that it is &s;poke of profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians; but that doth not &s;eem proper. Forthen when Countries come to be Chri&s;tiani|nized, there would be no difference between the <HI>Salt</HI> and them that are <HI>Salted.</HI> Chri&s;t knew that whole Nations would entertain the Chri&s;tian Religion; and who then would they be <HI>Salt</HI> unto? But I judge that he intends the Apo&s;tles, and it may be the &s;eventy Di&s;|ciples, if they were at that time pre&s;ent; tho' they were not yet called to their Office, yet Chri&s;t de&s;igned them to it. We find a di&s;tinction, <HI>ver.</HI> 1. between his Auditors and his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Seeing the Multitudes, he went up into a mountain, and when he was &s;et his Di&s;ci|ples came unto him.</HI> Again we may enquire, Why doth Chri&s;t compare them to Salt? <HI>An&s;.</HI> Salt has many u&s;eful qualities, it has Me|dicinal vertues in it, applied outwardly or in|wardly; but it hath two properties e&s;pecially, one is, that it &s;avours Meats, gives a grate|ful reli&s;h to them, makes them more accepta|ble to the &s;tomach, takes away their crude|ne&s;s and is an help to dige&s;tion. Job. 6.6. <HI>Can that which is un&s;avoury be taken without &s;alt.</HI> The other is, that it pre&s;erves things from corrup|tion and putrefaction. Fle&s;h and &s;ome other Meats are liable in a little time to corrupt
<PB N="3" REF="001998_0004_0FBA4F64D0991988">and &s;poil: but Salt has vertue to pre&s;erve them; and in this re&s;pect the Apo&s;tles are compared to Salt. He doth not &s;peak of what they were <HI>de facto,</HI> but of what they were <HI>de jure,</HI> what they were by their Office to be. Again it may be enquired, Who would have the benefit? <HI>An&s;.</HI> The Earth, or the Land where they dwell; by Earth you are to under&s;tand the Inhabitants of the Earth. This is amplifyed by their incurablene&s;s if they loo&s;e their &s;avour. Not but that a Mini&s;ter may be recovered, if he loo&s;e his &s;avour; but if the Mini&s;try &s;hould loo&s;e their &s;avour, there is none to recover them, 2. by their unpro|fitablene&s;s if they grow corrupt &amp; un&s;avoury. They are un&s;erviceable and de&s;erve to be re|jected. <HI>It is good for nothing but to be ca&s;t out and trodden under foot of men.</HI></P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q>THE Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are by their Office to pre&s;erve the People from Corruption.</Q>
<P>IT is a great mi&s;ery to a People to be cor|rupted, to be like putrifyed and rotten Meat, they will be an affliction and enemies one to another, and expo&s;ed unto the Judgments of God. But the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are means to pre&s;erve them from corruption.
<PB N="4" REF="001998_0005_0FBA4F66543704B0">Magi&s;trates in their place have their influence on them to pre&s;erve them from corruption: but e&s;pecially Mini&s;ters are u&s;eful that way. In &s;uch Nations where there is no Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, People are very corrupt: if by the light of Nature and &s;everity of Rulers, they be pre&s;erved from gro&s;&s;er iniquities, yet they are always very corrupt. But the Faithful Servi|ces of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters is a &s;pecial help to pre&s;erve from corruptions. A Go&s;pel-Mini|&s;try is looked upon by &s;ome Per&s;ons as an heavy charge, they groan under the burden of it; but Men have little rea&s;on to think much of the charge con&s;idering the benefit that they are to a People, as they are means to prevent the growing of corruption. Mi|ni&s;ters had need be careful that they do <HI>fulfill their Mini&s;try,</HI> for their work is not only of great concernment to them&s;elves, but al&s;o to Multitudes of others, by keeping the Country from corruption.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider 1. THAT <HI>People are very prone to grow corrupt.</HI> As the Bodies of Men if they be not duly looked after, will grow corrupt, &s;o will the Souls of Men. A profe&s;&s;ing People are in great danger, many of them are in their natural condition, and godly Men that are among them, are but in part &s;anctifyed; and there are a great many young ones growing up among them, that are born in &s;in, and a|bundance
<PB N="5" REF="001998_0006_0FBA4F7FF3903200">of temptations; and there is a great deal of danger that in a little time they will be corrupted. As Buildings are &s;ubject to decay, and Fields to be tainted, &s;o People are to be corrupted. I&s;ai. 1.21. <HI>How is the faith|ful city become an harlot.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. IN re&s;pect of the <HI>Principles of Religion.</HI> The Church of God is called the <HI>pillar and ground of truth,</HI> 1 Tim. 3.15. And if they don't <HI>hold fa&s;t the form of whol&s;om words,</HI> they will quickly run to ruin. The practice of Reli|gion doth depend upon the principles; if they loo&s;e the knowlege of the truth, they can't make due improvement of it. Blind|ne&s;s is a corruption and it leads to corrupt practices. And that they are in danger of,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) By <HI>Ignorance.</HI> A knowing People may in time become an ignorant People. The People of <HI>Grece</HI> were &s;ome of the learnede&s;t People of the World, in former Generations. <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> were called the two eyes of the World, but &s;ince that they are become very ignorant. Darkne&s;s many times &s;uc|ceeds where there was a great deal of light. If the pre&s;ent Generation be knowing Men, in a few years many of them may die, and the young Generation, if they have not &s;ui|table means of in&s;truction will be very igno|rant; though they grow to years of under|&s;tanding,
<PB N="6" REF="001998_0007_0FBA4F822A8A7120">may be ignorant of the principles of Religion. Parents may bequeath their E&s;tates to them, but they can't bequeath their Knowlege to them. If their Teachers be blind and ignorant, as the complaint is, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 56.10. no wonder if the People be ig|norant. The People of I&s;rael grew in con|tinuance of time a very ignorant People. Ho&s;. 4.1. <HI>There is no knowlege of God in the land.</HI> If a People be a knowing People, yet by the change of a Generation, they may be children in under&s;tanding.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) BY <HI>Errors.</HI> Men have a great deal of carnal rea&s;on, and &s;o are in danger to grow erroneous. There be a great many temptations from without to errors, there be many fal&s;e Doctrines publi&s;hed in the World. Men have mightily corrupted the Doctrine of the Chri&s;tian Religion: there have been heretical teachers that have broached dan|gerous errors. 2 Pet. 4.1. <HI>There &s;hall be fal&s;e teachers among you, who &s;hall privily bring in damnable here&s;ies.</HI> And Satan is bu&s;y to blind the minds of Men. 2 Cor. 4.4. <HI>The God of this world has blinded their minds.</HI> And there be many temptations in Mens own hearts to &s;educe them: carnal men don't love Evangelical truths; and the pride of their hearts expo&s;es them; they are unwilling to acknowlege &s;uch truths as they cannot com|prehend.
<PB N="7" REF="001998_0008_0FBA4F83B117AC38">The lu&s;ts of Mens hearts do in|cline them to receive heretical Doctrines. 2 Tim. 3.6. <HI>They lead captive &s;illy women la|den with &s;ins, led away with divers lu&s;ts.</HI> Many errors have mightily prevailed in the World. <HI>The &s;moak that has come out of the bottomle&s;s pit has darkned the air,</HI> Rev. 9.2. <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI> did &s;o for a while, and <HI>Pelagiani&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Popery,</HI> and <HI>Arminiani&s;m:</HI> many Countries are cor|rupted.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN re&s;pect of <HI>Practice.</HI> Fallen Men are great enemies to the power of Godline&s;s, and in great danger to carry them&s;elves corrupt|ly: it is difficult to make a profe&s;&s;ing People grow better, but they ea&s;ily grow wor&s;e. It is natural to tho&s;e that have chronical di&s;ea&s;es to grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e. People that are in a declining way, are in great danger to decline more and more. Jer. 16.12. <HI>Ye have done wor&s;e than your fathers.</HI> Land that be|gins to be tainted is liable to be tainted more and more.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) BY <HI>Formality.</HI> Where the Wor&s;hip of God is &s;et up, Men don't readily loo&s;e the <HI>form,</HI> but it is a frequent thing to loo&s;e the <HI>power</HI> of <HI>Godline&s;s.</HI> It is an ea&s;y thing to carry on Praying, to attend Publick Wor&s;hip, and to attend duties of Religion on the Sabbath: this may be done, though their hearts are violently &s;et upon the World, and they be
<PB N="8" REF="001998_0009_0FBA4F850DBC7AC0">under great prevailings of evil affections: but it is very cro&s;s to nature to mortify corrupti|ons, and to exerci&s;e them&s;elves in &s;elf-denial; give their hearts to God, and to be rejoycing in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. Many times People that retain the <HI>name</HI> of living loo&s;e the <HI>life</HI> of Religion, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.1. People are wont to grow <HI>lukewarm,</HI> Rev. 3.15. The &s;pirit of Religion doth decay by degrees.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) BY <HI>Vice.</HI> Evil practices frequently gain ground among them: the lu&s;ts of Mens hearts hurry them into bold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. There be bad examples and &s;mall means of re&s;traint, and &s;o evil practices get head. Ma|ny times People grow knavi&s;h and injurious one to another; they have their ways of de|ceit and oppre&s;&s;ion that mightily prevail Jer. 6.6. <HI>She is wholly oppre&s;&s;ion in the mid&s;t of her.</HI> Sometimes they fall into ways of Drunken|ne&s;s, and lie at the Tavern, and are pouring in &s;trong Drink, they can't work without it, nor play without it, nor make bargains with|out it. <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 3.1. They love Bottles of Wind|fall into ways of wantonne&s;s and rudene&s;s. Sin abounds in all profe&s;&s;ing Countries.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, 2. <HI>HOW Mini&s;ters are to pre&s;erve a People from Corruption.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THEY are to do it by their <HI>Preaching.</HI> Mini&s;ters are God's <HI>Me&s;&s;engers</HI> or <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="001998_0010_0FBA4F879800DA08">&s;ent to publi&s;h the Go&s;pel. Mar. 16.15. <HI>Preach the Go&s;pel to every creature,</HI> i. e. every humane creature. This is the principal part of their work. 1 Cor. 1.17. <HI>Chri&s;t &s;ent me not to bap|tize but to preach the Go&s;pel</HI> Therefore they are called Preachers. 1 Tim. 2.7. <HI>I am or|dained a Preacher.</HI> Other &s;ervices are to be done occa&s;ionally, but this is the con&s;tant &s;ervice that they mu&s;t addict them&s;elves unto. 2 Tim. 4.2. <HI>Preach the word, be in&s;tant in &s;ea|&s;on, out of &s;ea&s;on.</HI> And it is upon that account e&s;pecially, that <HI>double honour</HI> is due unto them. 1 Tim. 5.17. <HI>Let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, e&s;pecially they that labour in the word and doctrine.</HI> The Word of God duly Preached is the &s;pecial means to advance the work of &s;anctification. Joh. 17.17. <HI>Sanctify them by thy truth, thy word is that truth.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>BY in&s;tructing them in the Principles of Religion, and the Rules of God's Word.</HI> The light of nature teaches Men &s;ome things con|cerning God and His Attributes, and it teaches them the difference concerning many things that are morally good and evil; but this light &s;hines but dimly, and the characters that are written in the heart are much blurred and obliterated, and they have need to have tho&s;e things clearly inculcated. But the way of Salvation by Chri&s;t is a thing of pure re|velation. Natural rea&s;on is utterly &s;ilent about
<PB N="10" REF="001998_0011_0FBA4F8A72545E70">it. The Go&s;pel is called the <HI>Wi&s;dom of God in a my&s;tery,</HI> and <HI>bidden wi&s;dom,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.7. And the work of the Mini&s;ter is to feed Men with the <HI>&s;incere milk of the word.</HI> Joh. 21.15, 16. to <HI>Feed the Sheep,</HI> and <HI>Feed the Lambs.</HI> And it is not enough that Men are able to &s;ay their Catechize by rote, but the Mini&s;ter mu&s;t la|bour in it, that they may have a confirmed knowledge of the truth: that they may have a clear, di&s;tinct and explicit under&s;tanding of the Doctrines of Religion: they mu&s;t take pains to make them under&s;tand. Heb. 5.12. <HI>Ye need that one teach you again the fir&s;t principles of the oracles of God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) BY <HI>&s;olemn Warnings.</HI> That was Pauls practice. Act. 20.31. <HI>I cea&s;ed not to warn every one of you night and day with tears.</HI> That is the duty of the Watchman, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.8. There is great danger many times of publick calami|ties, becau&s;e of the abounding of Sin among them; and he mu&s;t warn them and reprove them. I&s;ai. 58.1. <HI>Cry aloud, &s;pare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, &s;hew my people their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, and the hou&s;e of I&s;rael their &s;ins.</HI> Godly Men are in danger to provoke God and bring &s;orrow upon them&s;elves; and the Mini&s;ter mu&s;t warn them. Many lie in a natural condition, and in danger of damnation; they had need be warned. <HI>Mar.</HI> 16.16. Some are of an unruly and ungoverned conver&s;ation,
<PB N="11" REF="001998_0012_0FBA4F9592D3A038">if they continue &s;o, their end will be de&s;tructi|on; the&s;e mu&s;t be warned. 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 5.14. Many Men that are in a dangerous way, are &s;evere and bold, and the Mini&s;ter mu&s;t &s;et the terrors of God before them; putting them in mind of the jealou&s;y of God, and the ter|riblene&s;s of his indignation. There be many Scriptures wherein God &s;peaks terribly to un|godly Men, and Mini&s;ters &s;hould make the&s;e Scriptures ring in their ears, and be with ut|mo&s;t &s;olemnity telling them of their danger. Phil. 3.18, 19. <HI>Many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you weeping, that they are enemies of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, who&s;e end is de&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) BY <HI>&s;uitable Encouragement.</HI> Awakened Sinners are in danger, though &s;eldom of de&s;|pairing, yet of being di&s;couraged; and that will be a great wrong to them, and Mini&s;ters mu&s;t be careful to encourage them. God puts &s;uch words into their mouths. I&s;ai. 55.6, 7, 8. Mat. 11.28. <HI>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden.</HI> Some are in dan|ger to be di&s;couraged from doing their duty, from fear of want, from fear of the anger of Man, for fear of reproach; but there are ma|ny promi&s;es in the Word of God to &s;trengthen Mens hearts in &s;uch ca&s;es. Gal. 6.9. <HI>Let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due &s;ea&s;on we &s;hall reap if we faint not.</HI> Some are ready to
<PB N="12" REF="001998_0013_0FBA4F96DC7FB338">&s;ink in their Spirits, becau&s;e of their afflictions, their &s;ins, their temptations, and their dan|gers: it is very fit &s;uch &s;hould be encouraged. 1 The&s;. 5.14. <HI>Comfort the feeble-minded, &s;up|port the weak.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. MINISTERS &s;hould pre&s;erve a People from Corruption by <HI>good Government.</HI> God has given power of ruling to Mini&s;ters. Heb. 13.13. <HI>Obey them that rule you and &s;ubmit to them.</HI> He has given a power of <HI>binding</HI> and <HI>lo&s;ing.</HI> Mat. 16.19. <HI>What thou &s;halt bind on earth &s;hall be bound in heaven.</HI> And he appoints that they <HI>rule well,</HI> 1 Tim 5.17. Mini&s;ters have a corrcive power to execute cen&s;ures on them that are ob&s;tinate. Mini&s;ters mu&s;t have a tender and compa&s;&s;ionate &s;pirit, but when Men are &s;turdy and rebellious, &s;everity is compa&s;&s;ion; executing Eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures is a <HI>terror to evil doers:</HI> this is a proper means that their <HI>&s;pirits may be &s;aved in the day of the Lord Je&s;us,</HI> 1 Cor. 5.5. Though private re|venge is utterly forbidden, yet they are to re|venge di&s;obdience: 2 Cor. 10.6. <HI>Having in a readine&s;s to revenge all di&s;obedience.</HI> This is the way to purge out the old leaven, to bring Men to repentance, and to put a &s;top to prowing iniquities, that the Land be not de|filed.</P>
<P N="3">3. BY <HI>being good Examples.</HI> Mini&s;ters mu&s;t be Examples to the People in all virtuous car|riages.
<PB N="13" REF="001998_0014_0FBA4F9806B76410">When Mini&s;ters teach Men their duty, they mu&s;t be obedient, whether the Mini&s;ter practices &s;o or no. Mat. 23.3. <HI>What|&s;oever they bid you ob&s;erve, that ob&s;erve and do: but do not ye after their works, for they &s;ay and do not.</HI> But Mini&s;ters had need give good Ex|amples. 1 Tim. 4.12. <HI>Be thou an example of the believers in word, in conver&s;ation, in charity, in &s;pirit, in faith, in purity.</HI> If they give a good Example, their words will &s;ink more into the hearts of Men. But if they addict them&s;elves to any vice, Men will de&s;pi&s;e them, and their coun&s;els and warnings, they will judge they don't believe them&s;elves what they &s;ay, they will nau&s;eate their Preaching. It would be very unplea&s;ant to hear a <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> make a grave haurange again&s;t hypocri&s;y, and to hear a <HI>Judas</HI> declame again&s;t &s;tealing. If Mini&s;ters be not of good conver&s;ation, Peo|ple will count their Preaching to be art and di&s;&s;imulation: it will render them contemp|tible in the eyes of the People. <HI>Mal.</HI> 2.8, 9. Men could hardly be patient to hear a Drun|kard &s;peak in the commendation of tempe|rance, and a wanton Man enlarge in the commendation of cha&s;tity.</P>

<P><HI>A Faithful Mini&s;try in a Land is a great Ble&s;&s;ing.</HI> If God gives a People a good crop,
<PB N="14" REF="001998_0015_0FBA4F9955718850">if he give peace and health, they count they have received great Ble&s;&s;ings: &amp; yet they take but little notice of the mercy of God in giving a faithful Mini&s;try unto them; but God reckons this a great mercy. Jer. 3.15. <HI>I will give them Pa&s;tors after mine own heart, that &s;hall feed them with knowledge &amp; under&s;tanding.</HI> Amos 2.11. <HI>I rai&s;ed up of your &s;ons for Prophets.</HI> They are great ble&s;&s;ings on this account, that they are the Salt of the Land. If Mens Provi&s;ions &s;hould putrify for want of Salt it would be a great calamity: but if the People of the Land &s;hould grow corrupt for want of a Faithful Mini&s;try, that would be a far greater calamity. When they are Faithful they are a means to prevent corruption. Mal. 2.6. <HI>He walked with me in peace &amp; equity, and did turn many away from iniquity:</HI> that is great &s;ervice.</P>
<P N="1">1. FOR if they &s;hould be corrupt <HI>they would be a great affliction one to another.</HI> When a People carry orderly and holily they will be a great comfort one to another: they will make their conver&s;ation and &s;ociety plea|&s;ant and profitable, and they will dwell toge|ther in unity: Religion teaches Men to love one another; but when they are corrupt they will be as thorns in one anothers &s;ides, Mic. 7.4. <HI>The be&s;t of them is as a brier, the mo&s;t up|right is &s;harper then a thorn-hedge.</HI> They will
<PB N="15" REF="001998_0016_0FBA4F9ADC596A70">be reproaching and backbiting one another, bla&s;ting the names of one another: Children will carry badly to Parents, and Parents to their Children; they will be injurious to one anothers E&s;tates, cheating, oppre&s;&s;ing, &s;teal|ing; they will be quarrelling and fighting; they will be debauching one another; they will corrupt Mens Daughters, and Wives too; they will be plagues one to another.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THEN their Pro&s;perity will do them hurt.</HI> If God be&s;tows plenty and &s;ucce&s;s on them, they will be taken with it, and it may be keep days of Thanksgiving: but they had better be without their Pro&s;perity. Their ble&s;&s;ings will become cur&s;es, their meat will be their poi&s;on, their pro&s;perity will make them more &s;ecure and hard hearted: they will flatter them&s;elves and take the more li|berty to be wicked, they will put fal&s;e con|&s;tructions on the Providence of God, and take occa&s;ion to flatter them&s;elves, and take the more liberty to carry loo&s;ly, they will take a liberty to be drunken, and live an effemi|nite life. <HI>But Je&s;urun waxed fat and kicked, thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatne&s;s: therefore he for&s;ook God that made him, and lightly e&s;teemed the rock of his &s;al|vation,</HI> Deut. 32.15.

<P N="3">3. <HI>THEY will have a great deal of Judgment.</HI> If they pro&s;per a while it wont continue, but the wrath of God will break out like fire. God will pur&s;ue them with the tokens of his anger. When I&s;rael corrupted them&s;elves in the Wilderne&s;s, the Plague came among&s;t them and many fell; &s;ometime fiery &s;erpents bit them: when they corrupted them&s;elves in the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> God &s;ent the <HI>Me&s;opotamians, Moabites, Midians, Ammorites and Phili&s;tines</HI> upon them: and brought them into great di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>Jud.</HI> 5.8. God is a jealous God and will not let their &s;ins go unrevenged. God has his days of Judgment, wherein they &s;hall be called to an account: and then they will cry to God and he will not hear: iniquity is a root that beareth gall and wormwood, and their &s;ins will co&s;t them dear. Job. 21.17. <HI>God di&s;tributeth &s;orrows in his anger.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>MULTITUDES of them will peri&s;h.</HI> When Religion flouri&s;hes among a People, they don't all go to Heaven when they die: many have but a name that they live; there is chaff as well as wheat; there be fooli&s;h Virgins a|mong the Wi&s;e. But when it is a corrupt time
<PB N="17" REF="001998_0018_0FBA4FA32350B1F8">few are converted, the means of Grace are much bla&s;ted; Men are minding their carnal enjoyments more than Heaven: they have great temptations, and the temptations have great power, and few of them will find their way to Heaven; there will be but a &s;mall number of godly Men, they will fail much as in <HI>Sauls</HI> time. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 12.1. <HI>Help Lord for the godly man cea&s;eth, for the faithful fail from a|mong the children of men.</HI> They will depend much upon their privileges and outward &s;er|vices; and generally as they dye they will go to hell: hell will be &s;tocked with them: an evil generation, is a generation of God's wrath. So when Chri&s;t was here, Mat. 8.12. <HI>The children of the kingdom &s;hall ca&s;t out into outer darkne&s;s, there &s;hall be wailing and gna&s;h|ing of teeth.</HI></P>

<P><HI>PEOPLE had need be careful that they don't provoke God to give them &s;uch a Mini&s;try as will be like un&s;avoury Salt.</HI> Sometimes God doth leave a People to &s;uch a Mini&s;try. I&s;ai. 56.10. <HI>His watchmen are blind, they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, that cannot bark; &s;leeping; lying down, loving to &s;lumber.</HI> Jer. 2.8. <HI>The Prie&s;ts &s;aid not where is the Lord, and they that handle the law knew me not, and the Pa&s;tors have
<PB N="18" REF="001998_0019_0FBA4FA89B0E25C0">tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t me.</HI> Zech. 11.15, 16. <HI>The Lord &s;aid to me, take unto thee the in&s;truments of a fooli&s;h &s;hepherd, for I will rai&s;e a &s;hepherd in the land, that &s;hall not vi&s;it that which is cut off,</HI> &amp;c. When God doth &s;o it is in a way of puni&s;h|ment. It is a &s;ign that &s;uch a People have greatly offended God, this is one way where|by God pours out his di&s;plea&s;ure upon a pro|voking People, and when he doth &s;o, they are like to grow more and more corrupt. The Scribes and Phari&s;ees were &s;uch Mini|&s;ters, they were blind guides, and the guide and the people both fell into the ditch; there|fore you &s;hould avoid &s;uch &s;ins as may bring this judgment. There is often a &s;uitablene&s;s between the &s;in &amp; the puni&s;hment. You may do it;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>BY barrenne&s;s under a Faithful Mini&s;try.</HI> It is &s;ometimes &s;o that Faithful Mini&s;ters have very little &s;ucce&s;s, they take a great deal of pains, and there is very little effect of it: Men dote upon the World, de&s;pi&s;e the Go&s;|pel, don't regard rules, make their hearts like an adamant, make a deri&s;ion of the aw|ful threatnings of the Word of God. God in this ca&s;e &s;ometimes takes away their op|portunities. When the People of <HI>Judah</HI> brought forth only wild grapes, God threatens this judgment, I&s;ai 5.6. <HI>I will lay it wa&s;te, and it &s;hall not be pruned <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, but there &s;hall
<PB N="19" REF="001998_0020_0FBA4FBC63751278">come up briars and thorns, and I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</HI> When Men dont profit by means, it is ju&s;t with God to take away &s;uitable means. God in anger gives them up to &s;trong delu&s;ions, &s;ends them &s;uch teachers as &s;hall mi&s;-lead them, and be a &s;nare to them, and &s;o they grow into corrupt prin|ciples, they did not like &s;ound doctrine, and they are fitted with &s;uch teachers as &s;hall nouri&s;h a &s;pirit of &s;ecurity in them. 2 The&s;. 2.10, 11, 12. <HI>Becau&s;e they received not the love of the truth, God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;ion, that they &s;hould believe a lie,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>BY abu&s;ing a Faithful Mini&s;try.</HI> Some|times People cannot endure &s;ound doctrine, and mi&s;-u&s;e God's Prophets. 2. Chron. 36.16. <HI>They mocked the me&s;&s;engers of God, and de&s;pi&s;ed his word, and mi&s;-u&s;ed his Prophets.</HI> They give them a great deal of trouble and mole&s;tation, they oppo&s;e them, contradict them, and are weakning their hands in their work. Sometimes they talk again&s;t them, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.30. Sometimes they per|&s;ecute them. This is a great provocation to God, and he many times puni&s;hes them, by leaving them to a corrupt and carnal Mini&s;try, that will do them little good, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to &s;uch as will do them a great deal of hurt. Thus God dealt with
<PB N="20" REF="001998_0021_0FBA4FBD899212C0">the People of I&s;rael, they abu&s;ed the Pro|phets that God had &s;ent unto them; and God took vengeance on them by leaving them to fal&s;e Prophets that deluded them, and were occa&s;ion of their ruin. Lam. 2.14. <HI>Thy Prophets have &s;een vain and fooli&s;h things for thee.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>BY counting their Mini&s;try a burden.</HI> Sometimes a &s;ordid &s;pirit prevails among a People, and they count their Mini&s;ters <HI>Bills</HI> of <HI>charge.</HI> They can lavi&s;h away a great deal in a Year, for the gratification of their pride and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;pend freely upon many frivolous occa&s;i|ons, but the &s;upport of the Wor&s;hip of God is counted a great burden: God may ju&s;tly remove faithful teachers in a way of anger for this, and leave them to &s;uch tea|chers as &s;hall not profit them. God is an|gry when they think much to maintain his Wor&s;hip, God gives them wherewith to do it, and he doth &s;o, that they may do it, and they provoke him, when they think that ill &s;pent that is laid out that way. <HI>If Mini|&s;ters &s;ow unto them &s;piritual things, it is not a great thing if they reap their carnal things.</HI> 1 Cor. 9.11.</P>

<HEAD>USE. III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LET this be the care of Mini&s;ters.</HI> Mini&s;ters mu&s;t do their Office in being the Salt of the Land. We find great complaint of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters before the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Captivity, in <HI>I&s;aiah, Jeremiah</HI> and <HI>Ezekiel.</HI> And after the Captivity in <HI>Ezra, Nehemiah,</HI> and <HI>Malachi.</HI> Mini&s;ters mu&s;t not only be careful that they don't corrupt the Land by evil manners and fal&s;e Doctrine; but al&s;o that they don't by their negligence &s;uffer the People to corrupt them&s;elves. It is a great fault in Mini&s;ters when they don't diligently &s;tudy the mind of God, but &s;pend their time in vi&s;its and wordly bu&s;i|ne&s;s. 1 Tim. 4.15. <HI>Meditate upon the&s;e things, give thy &s;elf wholly to them.</HI> And it is very blameable in them, when they Preach things that they have not duly &s;tudied. And it is a great &s;in in them, when they are a|fraid to deal faithfully, and to bear a te&s;timony again&s;t the &s;ins of the Land. If the Land be corrupted by their default, they will bring down the Anger of God upon them&s;elves: if they countenance the &s;ins of the Land, if they do not their duty for the preventing the &s;ins of the Land, they will make them&s;elves partakers of other
<PB N="22" REF="001998_0023_0FBA4FC063C44BB8">Mens &s;ins; and it will be a dreadful thing for God to charge the &s;ins of the Land on them. As, Mal. 2.8. <HI>Ye have cau&s;ed many to &s;tumble at the law.</HI> But if they be &s;erviceable ac|cording to their place, to keep the Land from being corrupted, God will reward them for it: He will be ready to acknowledge their &s;ervice. As, Mal. 2.6. <HI>The law of truth was in his mouth, iniquity was not found in his lips, he walked with me in peace and equity;</HI> and it will be a great honour and comfort to them, that they have been in&s;truments of the holine&s;s of the Land: when the <HI>Sons of Levi are purified, the offerings of Judah will be accep|table to God.</HI> As, Mal. 3.3, 4.</P>
<P>THERE are four things that Mini&s;ters &s;hould labour in to prevent the Corruption of the Land.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT there be a good number of the People &s;avingly Converted.</HI> Mini&s;ters &s;hould labour to convert as many as po&s;&s;ible, not only out of a re&s;pect to the Salvation of their Souls, but to prevent the Corruption of the Land. If Men are converted they will lead holy lives. 1 Joh. 3.9. <HI>He that is born of God &s;inneth not.</HI> Men that are converted are not &s;o apt to drink in fal&s;e Doctrine as other Men; and they will have a great influence
<PB N="23" REF="001998_0024_0FBA4FC208BF1ED8">upon the conver&s;ation of others; but an unconverted generation will be a corrupt ge|neration. <HI>Judg.</HI> 2.10, 11. Converted Men will teach their Children the ways of God, and di&s;countenance &s;inful practices: Con|verted Men will be good Examples: yea, they will &s;avour of divine things, and thereby &s;tir up that light that is in the con&s;ciences of o|thers. If Men that are converted have power, they will improve it for God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THAT godly Men be kept in a flouri&s;hing condition.</HI> Converted Men may be in a wi|thering condition, and be carried away with a worldly &s;pirit; but Mini&s;ters &s;hould be care|ful to keep them in a thriving way, that their Souls may be in a pro&s;perous condition, that they may be in an healthy e&s;tate, and enjoy much of the pre&s;ence of God. If godly Men be under decays, as &s;ometimes they are, Rev. 2.4. <HI>Lo&s;ing their fir&s;t love,</HI> that will be a da|mage to the religion of a country. When they flouri&s;h they will walk more exactly ac|cording to the rules of the Go&s;pel, they will be more zealous for God, they will more &s;trongly re&s;i&s;t temptation, they will be more &s;avoury, and their di&s;cour&s;es will be more edifying. P&s;al. 45.1. Their hearts will <HI>endita good matter, and their tongues will be as the pen of a ready writer.</HI> They will be more ex|emplary,
<PB N="24" REF="001998_0025_0FBA4FD06D972098">and others, will be loath to grieve them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THAT the Con&s;ciences of natural Men be kept tender.</HI> Mini&s;ters mu&s;t labour to po&s;&s;e&s;s Men with a deep &s;en&s;e of the jealou&s;y of God, and of the terrible Judgments that God executes for &s;in; they &s;hould be often &s;etting matter of terror before Men, remembring them of Eternal puni&s;hments, of the awful ways wherein God takes vengeance on impenitent Sinners, that they may be afraid of Sin. 2 Cor. 5.11. <HI>Knowing the terrors of the Lord we per&s;wade men.</HI> If their con&s;ciences be awakened, they will re&s;train them from &s;inful practices, and bridle in their corrup|tions. Mat. 19.20. <HI>All the&s;e things have I done from my youth.</HI> Their fear will di&s;po&s;e them to lead a religious life, and make them forbear ways of iniquity: Though de&s;titute of Grace, yet they will carry them|&s;elves commendably.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>THAT they be well principled again&s;t the errors and vices of the age.</HI> Ignorance expo&s;es a People to corrupt carriages: if Mens prin|ciples be erroneous they will carry badly, whether they be godly or ungodly. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.16. If Men mi&s;take the rule, con&s;cience will allow them to break it; yea, will force them to break it: But if Con&s;cience be duly
<PB N="25" REF="001998_0026_0FBA4FD24C97A200">informed, many natural men will not dare to go again&s;t their light. Therefore Mini|&s;ters &s;hould be careful to principle the Peo|ple aright, about the nature of true Conver|&s;ion, about true &s;igns of Grace, and about moral duties. Many Men are carried away with the corrupt practices of the Land, into ways of <HI>pride, inju&s;tice,</HI> and <HI>licenciou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> becau&s;e they think they are lawful. If they were well taught they would reform. The Word of God would be like fire in them; they would not dare to do &s;uch things as now they do. When any ill practice prevails, the Mini&s;ter &s;hould do as <HI>John</HI> did, Mat. 14.4. <HI>John &s;aid to him it is not lawful for then to have her.</HI></P>
