<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>GOvernor SHIRLEY, who is lately returned to his Government, would have met You in Per&s;on at this Con&s;erence; but his Stay Abroad hath been &s;o long, that it would have been a Di&s;&s;ervice to Him, as well as the Province, to have been here him&s;elf; but he hath done us the Honour of a Commi&s;&s;ion, and thereby hath given us full Power to appear and act in Behalf of the Government.</P>
<P>Through the Favour of divine Providence we have been pre&s;erved in our Voyage hither, and are very glad of this Opportunity of &s;eeing &s;o great a Number of you at this Interview, and de&s;ire to know what Tribes you repre&s;ent, and with what Power you do appear.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Treaty with you (we tru&s;t) hath been kept &s;acred &amp; inviolate on our Part, and in &s;ome Re&s;pects we have exceeded our Engagements, particularly as to your Trade with us, wherein you have had tho&s;e Advantages which none before you have enjoyed; and that your Hunting might be better &s;ecured to you, the Government (on the Return of the Commi&s;&s;ioners the la&s;t Year) immediately came into an Act, forbidding any Encroachments on your Game, under very &s;evere Pe|nalties, and doubt not but you have before now reaped the happy Effects of it; and be&s;ides this, have removed <HI>Hall</HI> from <HI>Montinicus,</HI> whom you then complained of as interrupting you in your Fi&s;hing and Fowling.</P>
<P>We rejoice in the happy Effects of the Peace and Friendship &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us, and hope that any Attemps to violate the &s;ame will have no Impre&s;&s;ion upon you; but that we may open our Minds freely to each other, &s;hall now proceed to a Conference with you, in which we have Nothing new to offer, but to renew and confirm our former Treaty (which is the &s;ame as that formerly agreed on between you and Governor DUMMER) that &s;o the Chain of Peace and Friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us may become brighter and brighter; and to receive any Propo&s;als from you for this End, if you have them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P></Q>

<P>Then delivered the Commi&s;&s;ioners the Treaty of Peace made and renewed in the Year 1749. And the Ratification thereof made the la&s;t Year: Which the Commi&s;&s;ioners ordered to be returned them. Which was done accordingly.</P></Q>

<P>We have &s;omething to &s;ay to you with Re&s;pect to the Trade and Beaver.</P>
<P>Beaver is now very good, and will be &s;o two Weeks hence; two Sabbath Days hence Beaver will be as good as when catch'd under the ice. The young Men want to know when Beaver is good.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commi&s;&s;i.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beaver always &s;peaks for it &s;elf: You may be &s;ure to have the full Worth of your Beaver according to its Goodne&s;s, at whatever Time of the Year it is catch'd.</P>

<P>What will Beaver be about two Week's hence?</P>

<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>The Government are determined to treat you with the &s;tricte&s;t Ju&s;tice, and the greate&s;t Kindne&s;s: And if you will attend to the fol|lowing Particulars, you mu&s;t be convinced of it.</P>
<P>You give no more for what you buy at the Truck Hou&s;e, than the &s;ame Articles be bought for with ready Money at <HI>Bo&s;ton:</HI> Strouds la&s;t Year were &pound;. 70. a Piece, now are but &pound;. 60.

<Q>The Government will &s;upply you with what you want; and have brought every Thing to the very lowe&s;t Price, as cheap by Retail as you could purcha&s;e by Whole&s;ale; and give you for your Beaver and Skins as they are &s;old at <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> The firm Re&s;olution of the Government is to make no Advantage of this Trade with you; they are determined to &s;upply you cheaper than the <HI>French</HI> can or will do: And in every In&s;tance of our Treatment of you, you mu&s;t be convinced that we &s;eek your Intere&s;t more than the <HI>French</HI> do, notwith&s;tanding the ba&s;e Methods they take to per&s;uade you to the contrary.</Q>

<P>Altho' we do not immediately charge YOU of this Tribe with this Neglect, yet you can't but remember the Commi&s;&s;ioners were a&s;&s;ured the la&s;t Year, that the Parents who had their Children then in Captivity might re&s;t &s;atisfied, that they &s;hould be returned them in the Spring following, at furthe&s;t; And as this Promi&s;e was made by the <HI>Norridga|wocks</HI> when you were pre&s;ent, you engaged that you would endeavour that the &s;everal Articles of Peace then renewed (of which this was one) &s;hould be complied with by the <HI>Norridgawocks,</HI> as well as your &s;elves; yet we mu&s;t inform you, that after all Attempts for their Redemption, Nothing is done; but the Children &s;till remain in the Hands of the <HI>French,</HI> altho' their Parents have &s;ince been at the Expence and Trouble of making a tedious Journey to <HI>Canada</HI> for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>You find that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have faithfully fulfill'd all their Promi&s;es with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and therefore ju&s;tly expect the like Return from you; and in Con&s;equence hereof, that you u&s;e your be&s;t Endeavours that all our Captives may be forthwith re&s;tored, that &s;o there may be no further Rea&s;on for Complaint on this Account.</P>

To which we reply, That it is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e and without the lea&s;t Foun|dation; for we do a&s;&s;ure you, that there is at this Time a good Harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King.</P>
<P>The Government of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> are fully &s;en&s;ible of the Artifices u&s;ed by the <HI>French</HI> to rai&s;e Jealou&s;ies and create Mi&s;under&s;tand|ings between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> and of the Methods the <HI>French</HI> u&s;e to defeat the Mea&s;ures the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> take for maintaining Peace and good Friend&s;hip: But as a Proof of our Sincerity, Governor SHIRLEY,

<P>WE are glad to &s;ee you this Morning, and hope you are all well.</P>

<SPEAKER>Commi&s;&s;i.</SPEAKER>
<P>We told you Ye&s;terday that all the Land on both Sides <HI>Kennebeck-River</HI> as high up as <HI>Wa&s;&s;erun&s;ick</HI> belonged to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they having bought it of the Indians; your Forefathers many Years ago &s;old them to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as appears by the Deeds we then produced to you, which Deeds you then appeared fully &s;atisfied with, as you knew by Tradition mo&s;t of the Names of the Indians who &s;igned them.</P>
<P>In Con&s;equence of the&s;e Purcha&s;es, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;aid Lands, and made Settlements upon them, and carried on a great Trade, particularly at <HI>Cu&s;hnoc</HI> and <HI>Teconnoc,</HI> where are now to be &s;een the Ruins of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Being convinced of this, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Right to &s;aid Land, you ceded them to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by &s;everal Treaties formerly made, particularly by Governor SHUTE'S, and Governor DUMMER'S; and by other Treaties before their Time, which you have &s;ince confirmed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> therefore have an undoubted Right to all the afore&s;aid Lands, and con&s;equently have a Right to &s;ettle them whenever they think proper: And it is expected by this Government, after giving you this Satisfaction, that you do not di&s;turb the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in any Settlements they are now about or may hereafter undertake on the Lands afore&s;aid: And we on our Part promi&s;e you, that you &s;hall not be interrupted in your Hunting &amp; Fi&s;hing; to which Purpo&s;e a Law of this Government has been made &s;ince the la&s;t Treaty, at your De&s;ire, forbidding under a very &s;evere Penalty all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from Hunting within &s;aid Lands, or giving you the lea&s;t Interruption in that or any other Regard.</P>
<P>As to the Owners of the&s;e Lands, who you &s;ay are at <HI>Arra&s;agonticook,</HI> and el&s;ewhere: We wi&s;h they were now here, that we might have an Opportunity of confering with them, and giving them the &s;ame Satis|faction 
<PB N="20" REF="007025_0019_102AEBD9B87A82E8">
we have now given you: But we de&s;ire you to inform them with what we have now told you, and we make not the lea&s;t Doubt, but that they will be entirely &s;atisfied; e&s;pecially as we have no De&s;ign to abridge them of the Liberty of Hunting and Fi&s;hing, which is the only U&s;e, either they or you, make of the &s;aid Lands, and of the Waters.</P>

<P>The&s;e Governours, and General NICHOLSON, called the Indians into <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> and after a Treaty was made, they talked about the Lands.</P>
<P>General NICHOLSON &s;aid, they would bury all that was bad, and make the Land &s;mooth.</P>
<P>The Indians de&s;ired the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might not &s;ettle further Ea&s;tward than <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> which was then &s;ettled.</P>
<P>We were then bid, that if any Engli&s;hmen &s;hould &s;ettle further Ea&s;t|ward than they had done, to inform the Governor of it, and they &s;hould pay dear for it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Penob&s;cotts,</HI> and <HI>Arra&s;agonticooks,</HI> who were the Owners of the Land that Way, were at that Treaty, and talk'd about it.</P>
<P>The Governor then &s;ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, it would not hurt us if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettled that Way: We mean at <HI>Brun&s;wick, North-Yarmouth, Ca&s;co-Bay</HI> and <HI>Saco</HI>; and the Indians con&s;ented that it might be &s;o.</P>
<P>Governor SHUTE had a Treaty at <HI>Arrow&s;ick,</HI> and the Indians then told the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they might go three Miles up this River.</P>
<P>Governor SHUTE &s;aid, it was not far enough. We were willing, and agreed that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould go as far up the River as <HI>Richmond,</HI> and the Governor was glad of it, and liked it well.</P>
<P>What we have now &s;aid is what we have heard of former Times.</P>

<P>We have al&s;o &s;een Governor SHIRLEY'S Letter; we take it kindly of him; he writes in Love, and is for Peace; and we like it well.</P>
<P>There have been a great many Governors at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; we believe them to be all very Good</P>
<P>We have never heard that any of the Governors de&s;ired the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might &s;ettle higher up than <HI>Richmond</HI>; altho' we have heard it from other People.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="007025_0020_102AEBDB49D94938">
It would hurt us for you to &s;ettle higher up the River than the New-Fort: We are not again&s;t your going &s;o far up, but are unwilling you &s;hould go any further up.</P>
<P>We have wrote twice upon this Matter to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and now you hear it from our Mouths.</P>
<P>We hope you will think of what we have &s;aid as to the Land; we are willing you &s;hould &s;ettle all the Lands below the New-Fort, and hope you will go on in &s;ettling them with Courage and a good Spirit: You have Land enough below the New-Fort, without going any fur|ther up.</P>
<P>We have told you our Hearts; we hope you will not &s;ettle any fur|ther up the River; the Indians hunt on both Sides of us; we have but a little Space; we de&s;ire to live as Brothers.</P>

<SPEAKER>Commi&s;&s;i.</SPEAKER>
<P>We de&s;ire to live in Peace with you, and like Brethren: We and you have always built on Governor DUMMER'S Treaty, and look'd upon it as a good one; by that Treaty, we are allowed to &s;ettle, where former Settlements have been made by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and to have all the Lands they have heretofore purcha&s;ed of the Indians; and they were then freely given up and confirmed to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>

<P>As your Forefathers &s;old the&s;e Lands to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and they were paid for by them; why are you again&s;t our &s;ettling them?

<P>The Rea&s;on is, we get our Living on the&s;e Lands, and if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould &s;ettle on them, it would drive away our Game; which has been the Ca&s;e with Re&s;pect to the Lands between <HI>Richmond</HI> and the Sea.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren of Penob&s;cott and Norridgawock,</HI></P>
<P>AT my Return to my Government, I found Letters from you to Lieutenant Governor PHIPS, dated the 6th of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t, from St. <HI>George's-Fort,</HI> and the 13th of the &s;ame Month from <HI>Fort-Rich|mond,</HI> in which you de&s;ire that the Conference between this Government and your Tribes may be &s;ooner this Year than it was la&s;t Fail, as that was held in your Hunting Sea&s;on, when but few of you could attend it, which created Jealou&s;ies and Di&s;&s;atisfaction among tho&s;e that were ab&s;ent: And in the Letter from St. <HI>George's-Fort</HI> it is particularly &s;igni|fy'd, <Q>That if I was returned to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> you &s;hould be glad you might &s;ee me, which would be a great Satisfaction to you.</Q></P>
<P>In An&s;wer to the&s;e Letters, I informed you in mine dated the 11th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> of my Arrival at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; and that the Bu&s;ine&s;s of my Go|vernment would not permit me to meet you in Per&s;on this Year; but that I &s;hould endeavour to &s;end Commi&s;&s;ioners to you as early as po&s;&s;ible, with the Pre&s;ents which this Government hath agreed to di&s;tribute an|nually among you, &s;o long as you &s;hall maintain good Faith &amp; Friend|&s;hip with it. And I have &s;ince receiv'd Letters from you in An&s;wer to it, dated <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 23d from St. <HI>George</HI>'s, and the 20th from <HI>Richmond,</HI> wherein you tell me, you rejoice at my Return from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that you are &s;orry the Bu&s;ine&s;s of my Government will not admit of my meeting you this Year, that you like the Contents of my Letter very much, and de|&s;ire that the Commi&s;&s;ioners may be &s;ent to you early in this Month, which Time the <HI>Norridgawock</HI> Tribe inform me, will &s;uit the St. <HI>Francois</HI> Indians well, &s;ome of them &s;ent me at the &s;ame Time a Pre&s;ent of a String of Wampum, as a Token of Friend&s;hip from their Tribe, who de&s;ire to be admitted to the Conference and Treaty with us.</P>

<P>This Letter and Sugge&s;tions of the Je&s;uit, <HI>Brethren,</HI> the plain De&s;ign of which is to prevent this Government from having any Treaty with you, and con&s;equently from making you the Pre&s;ents which they have promi&s;ed to give you from Year to Year; being &s;o contrary to your De|&s;ire expre&s;s'd in your Letter to me, and to the Friend&s;hip which this Government hath for you, and is de&s;irous to maintain with you: I thought proper, tho' this Prie&s;t, de&s;ires they may be kept &s;ecret from you, to communicate to you by the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that you may judge for your &s;elves, Whether in&s;tead of u&s;ing his Endeavours to pre&s;erve Peace between us, as he &s;olemnly profe&s;&s;es in his Letter, he is not u&s;ing Artifices to break it; Whether he is really &s;eeking to promote your Welfare by doing thus, or the Intere&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> at your Co&s;t, and How far you may confide in the Sincerity of this holy Father your Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>I can further a&s;&s;ure, <HI>Brethren,</HI> that this Prie&s;t's Sugge&s;tion, that War will &s;oon break out between the two Nations, is groundle&s;s, and that there was no Sign of it in <HI>France,</HI> whil&s;t I was there about a Year ago, nor in <HI>England,</HI> which I left a few Months &s;ince: I doubt not but the <HI>French</HI> may be de&s;irous of involving you and us in a War, if they can, by their Artifices; but I have Rea&s;on to think, that they will not be fond of en|tering into a War them&s;elves with us very &s;oon, lea&s;t they &s;hould loo&s;e <HI>Canada</HI> in it, as they did <HI>Cape-Breton</HI> in the la&s;t.</P>
