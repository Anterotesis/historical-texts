<HEAD>Fir&s;t LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received a Letter from thee the Week before la&s;t, which was &s;ent by thy Uncle <HI>Bolton:</HI> There were a great many kind Expre&s;&s;ions in it, and in thy Si&s;ter <HI>Clopton's</HI> like|wi&s;e. I acknowledge my &s;elf much obliged to you both, and to the whole Family, for many repeated Kindne&s;&s;es, and if my School had not engro&s;&s;ed &s;o much of my Time, I would have taken Opportunity to an&s;wer my dear Friend's Letter e're now, and upon that Account my Delay will be the more excu&s;able,</P>
<P>The News thou ha&s;t heard of my late Change, is really true, I cannot conceal it, for it is what I glory in; neither was it any Pro&s;pect of temporal Advantage that induced me to it, but a &s;incere Love to the Truth, and pure Regard to my own Soul: Neither can I be &s;ufficiently thankful to God, that he hath let me live to this glorious Day, and not cut me off in the Mid&s;t of my Sins and Provocations again&s;t Him; He is long-&s;uffering to us-ward, not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to Repentance: He hath brought me off from the Forms and Shadows of Religion, and let me &s;ee in a more illu&s;trious Manner what is the Life and Sub&s;tance of it, as he found me in &s;ome Degree faithful to that Mea&s;ure of Light and Knowledge he hath be&s;towed on me, whil&s;t I was in the Communion of the <HI>Church of En|gland;</HI> therefore he was plea&s;ed of late, as I humbly waited upon him, to make known to me greater and deeper My&s;te|ries of his Kingdom: And I can truly &s;ay, that I find by daily Experience, as I keep low and retired into that pure Gift which he hath planted within me, Things are every Day more and more cleared up to me, and the Truth &s;hines and prevails greatly over the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s; And if I &s;hould now turn my Back upon &s;uch Manife&s;tations as the&s;e, and entangle my&s;elf again with the Yoke of Bondage, &s;urely I &s;hould grieve the Holy Spirit: So that he might ju&s;tly withdraw his kind Operations, and never return more to a&s;&s;i&s;t and comfort me: For God is not mocked; Religion is a very &s;erious and weighty Thing; Repentance

and Salvation are not to be trifled with, nor is turing to God to be put off till our own Time, Lei&s;ure or Conveniency, but we mu&s;t love and cheri&s;h the lea&s;t Appearance of Chri&s;t, not &s;lighting or de&s;pi&s;ing the Day of &s;mall Things, but em|brace the fir&s;t Opportunity of following Chri&s;t in any of his Commands: When he &s;peaks, there is &s;uch Force and Au|thority in it that we cannot &s;tend to cavil, di&s;pute, or ask Que&s;tions; for unle&s;s we will be &s;o ob&s;tinate as to &s;hut our Eyes again&s;t the Sun, we mu&s;t needs confe&s;s to the Truth of his Doctrine, and pre&s;ently &s;trike in with it. And therefore, when for &s;everal Weeks I had lived more pri|vately and retiredly in <HI>London</HI> than was u&s;ual, Fa&s;ting twice or thrice in a Week, or &s;ometimes more, &s;pending my Time in reading the Scriptures and in Prayer to God, this was a good Preparation of my Mind to receive the Truth which he was then about to make known to me: I lamented the Er|rors of my pa&s;t Life, and was de&s;irous to attain a more excel|lent Degree of Holine&s;s than I had di&s;covered in the <HI>Church of England.</HI> In this religious Retirement God knew the Breathings of my Soul, how &s;incere I was, and re&s;igned to him when alone; I wanted him to &s;et me free, and to &s;peak Peace and Comfort to my Soul, which was grieved and wea|ried with the Burthen of Sin: For tho' I had &s;trictly con|formed my&s;elf to the Orders and Ceremonies of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and had kept my&s;elf from running into any great or &s;candalous Enormities, the Fear of the Almighty pre&s;erv|ing me; yet &s;till I had not that Re&s;t and Satisfaction in my&s;elf which I de&s;ired and greatly longed for; I found, when I had examined my State and Condition to God ward, that Things were not right with me.</P>
<P>As for a &s;ober and plau&s;able Conver&s;ation in the Eye of the World, I know that was a very ea&s;y Attainment; a good natural Temper, with the Advantage of a liberal Education, will quickly furni&s;h a Man with Abilities for that, &s;o that he &s;hall be looked upon as a Saint, and very &s;piritual, when per|haps in Chains of Darkne&s;s, in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s, and in the very Bond of Iniquity. If this Sort of Righteou&s;ne&s;s would have done, perhaps I might make as fair Preten&s;ions that Way as &s;ome others: But, alas! I &s;oon &s;aw the Empti|ne&s;s and Un&s;atisfactorine&s;s of tho&s;e Things: This is a Cover|ing that will not protect or hide us from the Wrath of the Almighty, when he comes to Judgment: 'Tis not a Man's
<PB N="5" REF="009098_0004_1031060CCC6AE4E0">
natural Temper, nor his Education, that makes him a good Chri&s;tian; this is not the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which the Go&s;pel calls for; nor is this Truth in the inward Parts, which God requires: The Heart and Affections mu&s;t be clean&s;ed and purified before we can be acceptable to God; therefore it was Death to me to think of taking up my Re&s;t in a formal Pretence of Holine&s;s; wherein, yet, I &s;aw, to my Grief, Abundance of People wrap'd them&s;elves; &s;lept &s;ecurely and quietly, dreaming of the Felicity of Paradi&s;e, as if Heaven were now their own, and they needed not trouble them&s;elves any more about Religion: I could not entertain &s;o dangerous an Opinion as this, for then I &s;hould be tempted to take up my Re&s;t by the Way, whil&s;t I was travelling towards the promi&s;ed Land. I think I made a little Progre&s;s in a holy Life, and through God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance I awakened &s;ome of my &s;piritual Enemies whil&s;t I lived in the Communion of the na|tional Church. I thank my God, I can truly &s;ay, whil&s;t I u&s;ed tho&s;e Prayers I did it with Zeal and Sincerity, in his Fear and Dread; but &s;till, I cea&s;ed not my earne&s;t Supplica|tion to him in private, that he would &s;hew me &s;omething more excellent, that I might get a compleat Victory over all my Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions, and might perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s before him; for I found a great many Sins and Weakne&s;&s;es daily attending me: And tho' I made frequent Re&s;olutions to for&s;ake tho&s;e Sins, yet &s;till the Temptation was too &s;trong for me, &s;o that often I had Cau&s;e to complain with the A|po&s;tle, in the Bitterne&s;s of my Soul, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</HI> Who &s;hall &s;et me free, and give me Strength to triumph over Sin, the World and the Devil? That I may in every Thing plea&s;e God, and there may not be the lea&s;t Thought, Word or Motion, Ge&s;ture or Action, but what is exactly agreeable to his mo&s;t holy Will, as if I &s;aw him &s;tanding before me, and as if I were to be judged by him for the Thoughts of my Heart next Moment. O divine Life! O &s;eraphick Soul! O that I could always &s;tand here for here is no Reflection, no Sor|row, no Repentance! but at God's right Hand there is per|fect Peace, and a River of un&s;peakable Joy. O that we might imitate the Life of Je&s;us, and be throughly furni&s;hed unto every good Word and Work! This was the frequent Breathing of my Soul to God when I was in the Country,

but more e&s;pecially after I had left my new Preferment of a Chaplain, and took private Lodgings in <HI>London:</HI> In this Re|tirement I hope I may &s;ay, without Boa&s;ting, that I was very devout and religious, and I found great Comfort and Re|fre&s;hment in it from the Lord, who let me &s;ee the Beauty of Holine&s;s; and the Sweetne&s;s that ari&s;es from an humbled mortified Life was then very plea&s;ant to my Ta&s;te, and I rejoiced in it more than in all the Delights and Plea&s;ures of the World.</P>
<P>And now it plea&s;ed God to &s;hew me, that if I would in|deed live &s;trictly and holily as becomes the Go&s;pel, then I mu&s;t leave the Communion of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> but knew not yet which Way to determine my&s;elf, nor to what Body of Men I &s;hould join, who were more orthodox, and more regular in their Lives. As for the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, I was &s;o great a Stranger to them, that I had never read any of their Books, nor do I remember, that ever I conver&s;ed with any one Man of that Communion in my whole Life: I think there was one in <HI>Foxly</HI> while I was a Curate there, but I never &s;aw the Man, tho' I went &s;everal Times to his Hou&s;e on Purpo&s;e to talk with him, and to bring him off from his wild and mad Enthu&s;ia&s;m, as I then ignorantly thought it to be: As for that Way, I know it was every where &s;poken a|gain&s;t; he that had a Mind to appear more witty and inge|nious than the re&s;t, would chu&s;e this for the Subject of his profane Je&s;ts and Drollery; with this he makes Sport, and diverts the Company; for a <HI>Quaker</HI> is but another Name for a Fool or a Mad-man, and was &s;carce ever mention'd but with Scorn and Contempt. As for Drollery, I confe&s;s I was never any great Friend to it; but indeed if all was true that was laid to the <HI>Quaker's</HI> Charge. I thought that they were &s;ome of the wor&s;t People that ever appeared in the World, and wonder'd with what Face they could call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, &s;ince I was told they denied the fundamental Ar|ticles of the holy Faith, to which I ever bore the highe&s;t Ve|neration and E&s;teem; and notwith&s;tanding I had always lived at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance from that People, and was very zea|lous in the Wor&s;hip of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and upon all Occa&s;ions would &s;peak very honourably of it, moreover was content to &s;uffer &s;ome few Inconveniencies upon that Ac|count, (as thou very well knowe&s;t) yet my Father &s;till look'd
<PB N="7" REF="009098_0006_10310614C44381C8">
upon me as inclining to the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and &s;ome Years ago &s;ignified to a Friend, he was afraid I would become an En|thu&s;ia&s;t; and whil&s;t I was at <HI>Bungan</HI> School he &s;ent me two Books to read that were writ again&s;t the <HI>Quakers,</HI> one of which was <HI>John Faldo's,</HI> who hath been &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed for it by <HI>William Penn.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t I lived in <HI>London</HI> in that private retired Manner (I was ju&s;t now &s;peaking of) walking very humbly in the Sight of God, and having Opportunity to reflect upon my pa&s;t Life, as I had Occa&s;ion to be one Day at a Book-&s;eller's Shop. I happened to ca&s;t my Eye on <HI>Barclay's</HI> Works; and having heard in the Country, that he was a Man of great Account among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> I had a Mind to &s;ee what their Princi|ples were, and what Defence they could make for them&s;elves; for &s;ure, tho't I, the&s;e People are not &s;o &s;illy and ridiculous, nor Maintainers of &s;uch horrid Opinions, as the Authors of the <HI>Snake,</HI> and &s;ome others, would make us believe. I took <HI>Barclay</HI> home with me, and I read him through in a Week's Time, &s;ave a little Treati&s;e at the End, which I found to be very philo&s;ophical, I omitted; but however, I &s;oon read enough to convince me of my own Blindne&s;s and Ignorance in the Things of God; there I found a Light to break in upon my Mind, which did mightily refre&s;h and comfort me in that poor, low, and humble State in which I then was; for indeed I was then, and had been &s;o for a con&s;iderable Time before, very hungry and thir&s;ty after Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and therefore I received the Truth with all Readine&s;s of Mind; 'twas like Balm to my Soul, and as Showers of Rain to the thir&s;ty Earth which is parched with Heat and Drought.</P>
<P>This Author laid Things down &s;o plainly, and proved them with &s;uch Ingenuity and Dexterity of Learning, and opened the Scriptures &s;o clearly to me, that without &s;tanding to cavil di&s;pute, rai&s;e Argument or Objection, or con&s;ulting with Fle&s;h and Blood, I pre&s;ently re&s;igned my &s;elf to God, and weeping for Joy that I had found &s;o great a Trea&s;ure, I of|ten thanked him with Tears in my Eyes for &s;o kind a Vi&s;ita|tion of his Love, that he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to look to|ward me when my Soul cried after him; &s;o, that tho' be|fore I was in great Doubt and Trouble of Mind, not know|ing which Way to determine my &s;elf, yet now the Sun breaking out &s;o powerfully upon me, the Clouds were &s;cat|tered:
<PB N="8" REF="009098_0007_10310617EDDF7820">
I was now fully &s;atisfied in my own Mind which Way I ought to go, and to what Body of People I &s;hould join my &s;elf. So I immediately left the Communion of the Church of <HI>England</HI> and went to <HI>Gracious-Street</HI> Meeting. After I had read <HI>Barclay,</HI> I read &s;ome other Books of that Kind, among which was an excellent Piece, tho' in a &s;mall Volume, call|ed, <HI>No Cro&s;s, No Crown:</HI> Thus I continued reading and frequenting Meetings for &s;everal Weeks together, but did not let any one Soul know what I was about: The fir&s;t Man I conver&s;ed with was <HI>G. Whitehead,</HI> and this was &s;everal Weeks after I began to read <HI>Barclay,</HI> and frequent their Meetings: By him I was introduced into more Acquaintance, and &s;till the farther I went the more I liked their Plainne&s;s, and the Decency and Simplicity of their Conver&s;ation: They do not u&s;e the Ceremonies and Salutations of the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> but &s;hake Hands freely and conver&s;e together as Bro|thers and Si&s;ters that are &s;prung of the &s;ame Royal Seed, and made Kings and Prie&s;ts unto God. O, the Love, the Sweet|ne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s of Affection I have &s;een among this Peo|ple! <HI>By this,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>&s;hall all Men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye have Love one to another.</HI> John xiii, 35. <HI>Put on therefore,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>(as the Elect of God holy and beloved) Bowels of Mercies, Kindne&s;s, Humblene&s;s of Mind, Meekne&s;s, Long-&s;uffering.</HI> Col. iii. 12.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear Friend, I have given thee an Account of my Proceedings on this Affair. As to my bodily State, if thou de&s;ire&s;t to know what it is, I may acquaint thee that I have my Health as well as ever, and I ble&s;s God I have Food and Raiment &s;ufficient for me, &s;o that I want no outward Thing; and I have the Nece&s;&s;ities and Conveniencies of Life liberally. Let us not burthen our &s;elves with taking Care for the Vanities and Superfluities of it; let us <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s our Ve&s;&s;els in Sanctification and Honour.</HI> 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> iv. 4. And as we bring our Minds into perfect Subjection to the whole Will of God, &s;o let us bring our Body to the mo&s;t &s;imple and na|tural Way of living, being content with the fewe&s;t Things, never &s;tudying to gratify our wanton Appetites, nor to fol|low the Cu&s;toms and Honours of Men, but how we may &s;o contract our earthly Cares and Plea&s;ures, that we may bring mo&s;t Glory to God, mo&s;t Health and Peace to our own Souls, and do mo&s;t Service to the Truth; and if this be our Aim,
<PB N="9" REF="009098_0008_10310619A7080CD8">
certainly a very &s;mall Portion of the Things of this World will &s;uffice us: Seeing we are Chri&s;tians, we &s;hould there|fore earne&s;tly pur&s;ue tho&s;e Things which bring us neare&s;t to God, and which are mo&s;t perfective of humane Nature; for what is more than a Competency &s;eems to be a Burden to a generous philo&s;ophical Soul, which would breath in a pure Vehicle, that &s;o it may have a quick Sen&s;e and Reli&s;h of all Ble&s;&s;ings, both of the &s;uperior and inferior Worlds.</P>
<P>Thou knowe&s;t, my dear Friend, that Religion is a very &s;erious Thing, and Repentance is a great Work, and one precious immortal Soul is of more Worth, than ten thou&s;and peri&s;hing Worlds, with all their Pomp and Glory: There|fore let us take Courage, and be valiant for the Truth upon the Earth, let us not content our &s;elves with a Name and Profe&s;&s;ion of Godline&s;s, let us come to the Life and Power of it; let us not de&s;pond of getting the Victory; we have a little Strength for God; let us be faithful to him and he will give us more Strength, &s;o that we &s;hall &s;ee the Enemy of our Peace fall before us, and nothing &s;hall be impo&s;&s;ible unto us: I &s;ay, my Friend, let us be faithful to that Mea&s;ure of Light and Knowledge which God has given us, to be pro|fited and edified by it in a &s;piritual Life, and as God &s;ees we are diligent and faithful to work with the Strength we have, he will more and more enlighten us, &s;o that we &s;hall &s;ee to the End of tho&s;e Forms and Shadows of Religion wherein we have formerly lived; but if he &s;ees we are about to take up our Re&s;t in tho&s;e Shadows, that we grow cold and indifferent in the Pur&s;uit of Holine&s;s, running out into Notions and Speculations, and have more Mind to di&s;pute, and to make a Shew of Learning and Subtility, than to lead a holy and devout Life, then 'tis ju&s;t with God to leave us in a carnal and polluted State, to continue yet but in the outward Court, where we may plea&s;e our &s;elves with beholding the Beauty and Ornaments of a worldly Sanctuary, and never witne&s;s the Vail being taken away, and that we are brought by the Blood of Je&s;us into the Holie&s;t of all, where alone there is true Peace with God, and Re&s;t to the weary Soul. I could &s;ay much more upon this Head if Time or Lei&s;ure would give Leave.</P>
<P>As for a particular An&s;wer to thy Letter, I have not Time now to give it; and for the pre&s;ent let this general An&s;wer

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Lately received a kind and brotherly Letter from thee, for which I return thee many Thanks. I am now in the Communion of the People called <HI>Quakers;</HI> and I have Cau&s;e to ble&s;s God for this happy Change of my Life: I am thro' Mercy brought off from the Shadow of Religion, and am pre&s;&s;ing forwards to get Acquaintance with the quickening Power, Life and Virtue of it, if that I may be a Chri&s;tian indeed, and not in Name and Profe&s;&s;ion only. I had a great while talk'd and di&s;cours'd of Holine&s;s, but did not under|&s;tand what it was to talk with God, to live and dwell in him.
<PB N="11" REF="009098_0010_103106237A06EF48">
Perhaps indeed &s;ome may think I made a fair Shew of Piety when I was with you. But alas! I was deeply &s;en&s;ible of my own Faults and Mi&s;carriages and I re&s;olved thro' God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance to enquire after &s;omething more Noble and Excel|lent than I had di&s;covered in that State; and ble&s;&s;ed be his Name for ever, that God hath an&s;wered the Cry of my Soul, and let me &s;ee a People that are hated and de&s;pi&s;ed by the World, but are dear to him; for he hath revealed to them the My&s;teries of the Kingdom; he hath carried them upon Eagles Wings, and cheri&s;hed them as the Apple of his Eye. As for me, I have been yet but in the outward Court; and far &s;hort of that Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s that is taught and practi&s;ed among this People: For they are come within the Holie&s;t of all; they are come into a near Communion with God, to behold the Cherubims of Glory that cover the Mercy-Seat, to be fed with the true Manna. The&s;e are My&s;|teries that are to be revealed unto the Meek and Lowly, but the Haughty, In&s;olent and Profane, cannot come, near them, nor ta&s;te of the Sweetne&s;s nor Comfort of them. Indeed the formal traditional &s;ort of People of the World, may talk of the&s;e Things as they have heard from others, and in their &s;ober Minntes may have &s;ome faint Glimmerings that Way; but to come to a real and inward Enjoyment of them, they can no more pretend to, than to work the greate&s;t impo&s;&s;i|bilities; all their Wit, and Subtility, and Learning, cannot reach higher for to handle of the Word of Life; this is pe|culiar only to tho&s;e who are content to for&s;ake all, and be|come Fools for Chri&s;t, they are tho&s;e who are in a good Temper to receive and co-operate with the Influence of the Holy Spirit, and have &s;een the Emptine&s;s and Vanity of all tho&s;e Things that are &s;o much admired by the World; the Schools, and Univer&s;ities, and Learned Doctors, and Great Rabbies, have not profitted me; they are ravened from the Spirit of God, and gone out into their own Notions and Speculations, thinking thereby to &s;earch out God and com|prehend the Truth. Alas! the My&s;teries of God's King|dom are far out of their Reach in their carnal Minds; they weary them&s;elves in vain; the Vulture's Eye cannot pierce into the&s;e Secrets; all the great Critick Scholars and Philo|&s;ophers of the World are Fools in the&s;e Things, and which they are wearying them&s;elves to find the deep Things of our

God, &s;tudying and racking their Heads, to&s;&s;ing and tumbling to and fro like a wild Bull in a Net, and knows not which Way to di&s;entangle him&s;elf; the more he &s;truggles, the weaker he grows, the fa&s;ter he is bound; &s;o the more the&s;e vain Talkers read, the more they write; the more they cavil and di&s;pute, the further they are from God, and the more they declare their Hatred and Enmity to the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and to the Simplicity of the Go&s;pel. I have been a long Time a weary of the Folly and Impertinency of the&s;e Men, and chiefly the celebrated Fathers of the Church, as they call them; the Councils and Synods of Old, are now of very &s;mall Account with me; I am not a&s;hamed to &s;it under the Teachings of Women and Mechanicks, how&s;oever they may &s;eem in the Eye of the World; for they teach me more Chri&s;tianity, and in&s;truct me more perfectly in a divine Life, than all the &s;tudied elaborated Sermons and Di&s;cour&s;es that ever I heard at the Univer&s;ities, or &s;ince; their Words are with Power, they are mightily a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the Spirit of God, they &s;peak with Maje&s;ty and Authority, and there is a native Beauty, Clearne&s;s and Solidity of Expre&s;&s;ion, that &s;hines thro' their Di&s;cour&s;es, which is &s;ufficient to an&s;wer that groundle&s;s Calumny, <HI>viz. The Quakers Preaching is Non&s;en&s;e, and no Body could under&s;tand them.</HI> This I have heard often refuted by many living Te&s;timonies, &s;o that I do rather think them the be&s;t Wits, and the mo&s;t ingenious Peo|ple in the World; for they employ their Parts and Learning in the Fear of God to his Glory and Service, and to promote the true&s;t Intere&s;t of Mankind. As for the little Je&s;ts, Wit|tine&s;&s;es, and vain Pedantry of the Age, which I know the World hath E&s;teem for, and nothing will plea&s;e but what a|bounds with &s;uch Fooleries. I &s;ay, if the <HI>Quakers</HI> be defici|ent in any of the&s;e, it is not for want of Abilities, or becau&s;e they have le&s;s Wit than other Men, but becau&s;e they have more Prudence and Wi&s;dom to govern it, and that is the Rea&s;on why they avoid &s;uch childi&s;h Vanities, which are &s;o freely u&s;ed and indulged by others, to the great Di&s;honour of God and the Chri&s;tian Religion; and therefore becau&s;e they do not &s;eek to plea&s;e a wanton Age, to make People laugh and be merry, nor to entertain that carnal airy Mind with plea&s;ant Stories, fine Notions and witty Expre&s;&s;ions of natural Things; from thence it is that they have been &s;hame|fully traduced by the World, as the mo&s;t ignorant, blind

and fooli&s;h People that ever made any Profe&s;&s;ion or Religion, and yet this is the People to whom I have now joined my &s;elf in a &s;incere Love to Truth, God knoweth; and I glory more in this Fellow&s;hip and Acquaintance with the&s;e Lambs of Chri&s;t, than if I were related to the greate&s;t Kings, Lords and Potentates upon the Earth. Oftentimes hath my Spirit been refre&s;hed with theirs, when we have met together to wait upon God; and my Soul &s;till longs and pants more and more to be filled with the&s;e divine Comforts: he is ready al|ways to pour down Ble&s;&s;ings upon us, if we could qualify our&s;elves for the Reception of them; if we would put away vain Thoughts, which cloud and darken the Mind, and &s;o hinders the favourable Influence and Iradations of Heaven.</P>
<P>And &s;ince it hath plea&s;ed God to vi&s;it me of late, and to make known to me excellent Things in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, he a|lone is to have the Prai&s;e and Glory of all, and now I freely re&s;ign my&s;elf to the Conduct of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit; now let the Truth pro&s;per, now let it run and he glorified in the Earth, let it &s;hine out in its full Lu&s;ture, to the Ter|ror and Confu&s;ion of all the Enemies thereof, and to the reviving of the Souls of the Hungry and Thir&s;ty, who are ready to faint, waiting for and expecting the Con|&s;olation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> until the Times of Refre&s;hment comes from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, who will open a Foun|tain for <HI>Judab</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &s;o that Rivers &s;hall run in dry Places: There will he &s;peak Peace to his People, and after they have &s;at &s;ilent a little While in the Du&s;t, &s;uffering pa|tiently the cha&s;tizing Rod of his Love to pa&s;s over them, he &s;hall then comfort the Daughter of <HI>Sion,</HI> and &s;ay, <HI>Ari&s;e thou afflicted, and weep and mourn no more, but put on thy beautiful Garments.</HI> Oh! <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> rai&s;e thy Head, uncover thy Face, and gird up thy Loins with Strength, &s;ee the Day break, and the Morning &s;pread it &s;elf upon the Mountains; now the &s;orrowful Nights of Affliction are gone over, the Clouds are &s;catter'd and gone, the Sun is ri&s;en in its Bright|ne&s;s, and now Joy and Peace &s;hall be multiplied; in a little Wrath I hid my Face from thee for a Moment, but with ever|la&s;ting Kindne&s;s will I have Mercy on thee, &s;aith the Lord thy Redeemer.

that the Scripture may be no more a &s;ealed Book to us, but that we may feel the precious Truths therein recorded to be fulfilled, in our own Particulars. Then there we &s;hall never be weary of praying, and reading the holy Scriptures; we &s;hall never be loath or unwilling to come into God's Pre&s;ence; for his Love, and the Sweetne&s;s of his Ointment, will draw and allure us to dwell always under his Canopy, that we may feel Life and Power to flow from Him who is the Ocean that &s;upplies all the Wants of the Children of Men; and how &s;hall we come to ta&s;te of that heavenly Banquet he hath prepared for us, that we may eat and drink at his Table, and that our Souls may delight in Fatne&s;s? I &s;ay, how &s;hall we attain to this, but by a &s;trict and mortified Life? Certainly the more we retire from worldly Joys, and empty our &s;elves of earthly Comforts and fal&s;e Delights, the fitter we &s;hall be to receive tho&s;e that are &s;piritual and heavenly; and not only to receive and rejoice in them for a Time, but to live and dwell in them for ever, for this is the Life of Je&s;us; and here the Kingdom of God reigns in the Heart and Soul, by which it is changed from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. And now I would a&s;k all the wife and prudent, all the rich, all the noble and learned Men of the World, what they think of the&s;e Things: Whether this is to be learned in their Courts and Palaces? Or whether any of the great Scholars and Univer&s;ities in Chri&s;tendom can furni&s;h us with &s;uch a Sy&s;tem of Divinity as this? No, they hate it, and de&s;pi&s;e it, and in&s;tead of a &s;ober An&s;wer to my Query, they return Scoffs and Contempt. This is Canting they &s;ay, and an idle Dream, and forged Chimera of my own Brain, and a great many more opprobrious Names they have for &s;uch Enquiries as the&s;e. Sometimes, perhaps, they will &s;uffer the Expre&s;&s;ion, with an hypocritical Shew, will pretend to pity me, calling it an unhappy Effect of Melan|cholly, and too much Retirement from the World; and this they think too much Conde&s;en&s;ion, that I ought to think my &s;elf beholding to them for giving it &s;o mild a Character; for at other Times they deal more &s;harply, and &s;ay confidently that it is Madne&s;s, Delu&s;ion, Witchcraft, and diabolical En|thu&s;ia&s;m.</P>

Time. As for my Enemies, I can truly &s;ay, I thank God I pity them, and pray for them; they do not hurt me, but them&s;elves. And now, my dear Friend, before I conclude, &s;uffer me a little to &s;peak of thy pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances; for, as God knoweth, my Bowels yearns towards thee in the tender Love of Je&s;us, I &s;uppo&s;e thou art now where I left thee, <HI>viz.</HI> with the Lord <HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> &s;o called, in the Ca|pacity of a Chaplain, an Office which I have had a little Ex|perience of my &s;elf, &s;ince I la&s;t &s;aw thee; but was quickly &s;o weary of that &s;ervile Yoke, &s;o unworthy of that holy Function I bore, that in ten Days Time I quitted my new Preferment, and left it more freely than ever I un|dertook it. What Peace or Satisfaction thou can&s;t have in &s;uch Employment I know not; for my Part, I could find none; my Soul was grieved and burthen'd every Day with &s;eeing and hearing their evil Deeds, beholding their Vani|ties and Exce&s;&s;es; this was a Sword to my Soul and Spirit, it wounded me very deep; and I do &s;olemnly profe&s;s, I had rather beg my Bread from Door to Door, than to live in the like Bondage again, where I mu&s;t be obliged to &s;uch Cere|monies and Formalities, to flatter Men in their Sins, to cry Peace, Peace; and to &s;ow Pillows under the Arm-holes of delicate People, that can never bear the lea&s;t Check or Frown, but expect the mercenary Prie&s;t &s;hould always laugh or &s;mile in their Faces, even when he &s;ees plainly they are going to Hell and De&s;truction; and yet I mu&s;t tell thee, the Family I was in, was looked upon as one of the mo&s;t &s;ober and regular, as the World goes now; and I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, I did not leave them for any Drinking, Gaming, Swearing or Whoring that I perceived among&s;t them; in all the&s;e filthy &s;candalous Practices, as far as I could &s;ee, they were blamele&s;s; but yet I &s;aw their Hearts were not right; for they were Lovers of Plea&s;ures, more than Lovers of God; and thou knowe&s;t that he or they, let them be great or &s;mall, if they live in Plea&s;ures, grow fat and wanton again&s;t Chri&s;t; &s;uch Per&s;ons are dead while they live: I &s;ay, whatever their Faith, or Principles, or Profe&s;&s;ions may be, yet in Religion they are dead.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay no more, but ha&s;ten to a Conclu&s;ion. If thou de&s;ire a particular Account of my Convincement, thou may&s;t &s;ee it in a Letter which I wrote lately to <HI>Richard Lake,</HI> Junr.

Dear Friend, I have no more at pre&s;ent, but to let thee know I do mo&s;t heartily pray for thee, that thou may&s;t con&s;ider Things without Pre|judice, and not &s;uffer any of the Temptations or Allurments of the World to draw thy Mind from God, and to hinder thee in thy Pur&s;uit of Holine&s;s; he that loves Father or Mo|ther, Brother or Si&s;ter, or any of the Endearments of this World more than Chri&s;t, is not worthy of him; but if thou wilt come into Communion with Chri&s;t, and chiefly to follow the Guidence of his Light and Spirit, O what a ble&s;&s;ed and happy Re&s;t &s;halt thou find to thy Soul!
