<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friendly Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO &s;ee the Diver&s;ity of Men's Opinions and the many Cen&s;ures that &s;ome ca&s;t upon Truth, brought me to a &s;erious Concern to appear in this manner, that, if po&s;&s;ible, I might be in|&s;trumental to remove the Clouds of Prejudice from &s;ome Minds; and by &s;peaking intelligibly to Men of moderate Tempers and common Capa|citys, as much as in me lieth, to demon&s;trate what I have clearly &s;een, to wit, <HI>CHRIST the Hope of Glory, the only means of Man's Salvation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the Rock I have built on, who am in Unity with the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> who&s;e Te&s;timony I know to be &s;ound, and yet I have not endeavoured to per&s;wade any to come to them as Men, but to that Foundation they as well as I direct Men to.</P>
<P>I have u&s;ed as much Brevity as I could, with Clearne&s;s, in this little Piece, knowing there are many Books of the &s;ame Tendency wrote by Men of larger Gifts; yet as &s;maller Tracts are &s;ome|times of Service, when bigger Volumes cannot ea&s;ily be got: And as I have writ with Charity and Plainne&s;s, I hope it will be acceptable &amp; ad|vantageous to my Readers; which with great Sincerity and Affection is the real De&s;ire of (Courteous Reader) Thy Souls Friend.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH many Books have been wrote on this Subject; yet I conceived the writing of this &s;mall Tract to be my Duty: And have therefore ca&s;t my Mite into the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with that heavenly Te&s;ti|mony the Evangeli&s;t <HI>John</HI> bears of Chri&s;t: <HI>In the Beginning was the Word,</HI> (here he plain|ly declares where the Word was) <HI>and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</HI> Here (he affirms what it is,) he further goes on to confirm the foregoing Words, <HI>The &s;ame,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>was in the Beginning with God, all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made: In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</HI> John i. 1, 2, 3, 4.</P>
<P>It was the Eternal Word which made all things, that upholds all things by his eter|nal Power, who was with the Father before the World was made: For we find he was in the Beginning with God, all things were made by him, and without him was not a|ny thing made that was made; in him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.
<PB N="4" REF="004327_0004_100454FAB12C3608">
Hence it is plain, that CHRIST was and is the WORD of GOD, and the only Means of Man's Salvation. The holy Scriptures are a divine Declaration of him, his Work and Power, who&s;e Work was with the Fa|ther both to make Man and &s;ave him. For although Man by his Di&s;obedience had in|curred the Wrath of God; yet he was plea&s;ed to provide a divine Mediator, who wrought with the Father for the Salvation of Men; and this was Chri&s;t the Eternal Word.</P>
<P>This the holy Scriptures abundantly prove; for it was impo&s;&s;ible for Man of him&s;elf to make an Attonement to God for the Sin he had committed in breaking his Command. Now, God in his great Mercy &s;hewed his Love to Men thro' <HI>Chri&s;t, reconciling the World unto him&s;elf, not imputing their Tre&s;pa&s;|&s;es unto them, but,</HI> as &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>hath committed unto us the Word of Reconciliation,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.19. Now, this Word of Reconci|liation, was Chri&s;t, was that Word that was the Mediator for Man, and it is that Word that is the Saviour of Man; 'tis this Word nigh in the Heart, that Man is to hear: <HI>For the invi&s;ible things of him from the Crea|tion of the World are clearly &s;een, being under|&s;tood by the things that are made, even his e|ternal Power and Godhead,</HI> Rom. 1.20. Thus we may &s;ee the heavenly Harmony of the
<PB N="5" REF="004327_0005_10045508163443E0">
holy Scriptures how they concur; and that Spirit and Power that gave them forth, brings Man to a right Under&s;tanding of them.</P>
<P>Now, after Man had fallen by Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion, he was received into Mercy by the Means and Mediation of Chri&s;t; Life and Death was &s;et before him, with this annexed to it, <HI>Choo&s;e Life, that both thou and thy Seed may live,</HI> Deut. 30.19. Man was created after the Image of God in Holine&s;s, but for his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion incurred the Wrath of God; then he was made &s;en&s;ible he had &s;inned; then he was afraid of that Divine Pre&s;ence he had before injoyed; and in that State it &s;eemed meet to divine Wi&s;dom, to provide a Mediator, which was Chri&s;t the Eternal Word of God. Now, we find, that <HI>Adam</HI> after he &s;ell, &s;ought to hide him&s;elf from God; and had not God in infinite Mercy called unto him, he had been utterly lo&s;t: But willing to bring Man to Repentance he called unto Adam, <HI>Adam where art thou</HI>? Now, <HI>Adam</HI> of him&s;elf could not come to a State of Repentance, neither could he fly from the Voice of the Lord, no; <HI>I heard thy Voice and was afraid, becau&s;e I was naked, there|fore I hid my &s;elf. And he &s;aid, Who told thee thou was naked? ha&s;t thou eaten of the Tree, whereof I commanded thee, Thou &s;houlde&s;t not eat</HI>? This was great Conde&s;cention thus to ex|po&s;tulate
<PB N="6" REF="004327_0006_1004550B32CF4360">
the Ca&s;e with <HI>Adam,</HI> thereby to open his Under&s;tanding and bring him to Repentance.</P>
<P>The great Love of God to Mankind is al&s;o plainly &s;hewn, in providing a Mediator to make Attonement for their Sins; for altho' Man's Di&s;obedience occa&s;ioned his being tur|ned out of Paradi&s;e, a Means of Re&s;tauration was provided for him; the Serpent who tempted him was cur&s;ed above every Bea&s;t of the Field, and the <HI>Seed of the Woman</HI> it was promi&s;ed &s;hould brui&s;e the Serpent's Head. This promi&s;ed <HI>Seed</HI> was <HI>CHRIST</HI>; and for this End did he make his Appearance unto Mankind through divers Di&s;pen&s;ations. His Appearance to the holy Patriarchs, <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> was in the &s;imilitude of An|gels, and he gave to faithful <HI>Abraham</HI> a Sign and Seal of his Mercy, to wit, Circumci&s;ion in the Fle&s;h, as a Type and Figure of what was to follow: Then followed the Di&s;pen|&s;ation of the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> added becau&s;e of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, in order to bring Man near to the Lord; the Ceremonial Part of which &s;tood in outward Ob&s;ervations, and were fi|gurative of what was to follow, as the Pa&s;chal-Lamb, which was to be &s;lain and the Blood to be &s;prinkled on the People, &s;ignified, that it &s;eemed meet to Divine Wi&s;dom, that no Attonement &s;hould be made without Blood,
<PB N="7" REF="004327_0007_10045517E5BA7E38">
and the Burnt-Offerings made by Fire, typi|fied the one Offering made by Chri&s;t for the Sins of the World. And Chri&s;t being come, the Sub&s;tance of that Law, all Types and Figures in the Law were fulfilled in him; for <HI>Chri&s;t is the End of the Law, for Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth,</HI> Rom. 10.4.</P>
<P>Now, true Believers in Chri&s;t they &s;ee through the Law, that Chri&s;t came not to de&s;troy it, but to fulfill it; and as it is ful|filled, the Service of the Law is at an End: <HI>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Fle&s;h, God &s;ending his own Son in the likene&s;s of &s;inful Fle&s;h, and for Sin con|demned Sin in the Fle&s;h; that the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Fle&s;h but after the Spirit,</HI> Rom. 8.3, 4. This is enough, one would think, to &s;atisfy all &s;orts of Men profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tiani|ty, to for&s;ake all outward Shadows, and come to Chri&s;t the Sub&s;tance of all.</P>
<P>For even under the Law, in Performance of the Service required in that Di&s;pen&s;ation, the Upright in Heart with an Eye of Faith &s;aw through the End of the Law, to wit, the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> which was to follow; in this Faith they &s;tood who were faithful in that Day, and it is the &s;ame in this: For that Spirit then that re&s;ted in the bare Ob&s;erva|tion of outward Performances, even that Spi|rit
<PB N="8" REF="004327_0008_1004551EBB144098">
denied him, when the Fulne&s;s of Time was come for his ble&s;&s;ed Appearance to do his Father's Will in him. They would not receive, but preferred <HI>Barrabas</HI> a Robber be|fore <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the Saviour of the World; yet they were many of them learned knowing Men as to worldly Wi&s;dom, but the World by Wi&s;dom knows not God. This is the Ca&s;e of many in this very Age, they will not receive him in his &s;piritual Appearance, no, no, that's too mean for them, they are too learned to come there: But, hear what Chri&s;t &s;aith to the unbelieving Jews? <HI>He that believ|eth on the Son, hath everla&s;ting Life; and he that believeth not the Son &s;hall not &s;ee Life but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> Joh.3.36</P>
<P>Now, the Jews who re&s;ted in the outward Ob&s;ervation of the Law, not coming to the Sub&s;tance of the Law, crucified him in the Fle&s;h; and the profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians that re&s;t in outward Ob&s;ervations and will not come to him, they crucify him in Spirit. Hear what Chri&s;t &s;aith to the unbelieving Jews <HI>Ye &s;ent unto John,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>and he bore Wit+ne&s;s unto the Truth; but,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>I have greater Witne&s;s than that of John: For the Works which the Father hath given me to fi+ni&s;h, the &s;ame Works that I do, bear Witne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> me, that the Father hath &s;ent me: And the Father him&s;elf which hath &s;ent me, hath bor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">

Witne&s;s of me: Ye have neither heard his Voice at any time, nor &s;een his Shape; and ye have not his Word abiding in you: For whom he hath &s;ent, him ye believe not. Ye &s;earch the Scriptures,</HI> &s;aith he; <HI>for in them ye think ye have eternal Life, and they are they which te&s;tify of me: And ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</HI> Further adding, <HI>I am come in my Fa|ther's Name, and ye receive me not.</HI> Joh. 5. v. 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43. I have made this large Citation to open my Reader's Un|der&s;tanding: The&s;e Texts are &s;o clear and full to the &s;ubject Matter I am upon, I think no Man can with Rea&s;on be di&s;&s;atisfied. Here Chri&s;t plainly and fully &s;hews his Work&punc; and Power, which was to bring Man to him|&s;elf; in &s;hort, He that comes not to him, will never be &s;aved by him; no, no: For his Invitation is, <HI>Come unto me all you that are heavy laden, and I will give you Re&s;t.</HI> Now, there is nothing can lead to him but the Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from him: For if the Performance of outward Things could have made Men perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, there had been no need of his being crucified for the Sins of the World; but in that they were imperfect in them&s;elves, he came and offered him&s;elf as a Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World, that, as he was lifted up upon the Cro&s;s, he &s;hould draw all Men after
<PB N="10" REF="004327_0010_100455389084D220">
him. <HI>Wherefore remember,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>that ye being in time pa&s;t Gentiles in the Fle&s;h, who are called Uncircumci&s;ion by that which is called the Circumci&s;ion in the Fle&s;h made by Hands; that at that time ye were without Chri&s;t, being Aliens from the Common-wealth of I&s;rael, and Strangers from the Covenants of Promi&s;e, having no Hope, and without God in the World: But now in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, ye who &s;ometimes were far off, are made nigh by the Blood of Chri&s;t. For he is our Peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the Middle-wall of Par|tition between us; having aboli&s;hed in his Fle&s;h the Enmity, even the Law of Commandments, contained in Ordinances, for to make in him|&s;elf, of twain, one new Man, &s;o making Peace; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one Body by the Cro&s;s, having &s;lain the Enmity thereby: And came and preached Peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh: For through him we both have an Ac|ce&s;s by one Spirit unto the Father.</HI> Ephe&s;. 2. v. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</P>
<P>I think the&s;e Texts clearly demon&s;trate the great Work he has done for Man, even from the Beginning down to this very Day: For he it was that made Peace, and he it is that makes Peace between God and Man; He it was that led <HI>I&s;rael</HI> through the Red Sea and through the Wilderne&s;s; he it was that
<PB N="11" REF="004327_0011_1004553EF82C5348">
&s;tood between <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his cho&s;en <HI>I&s;rael</HI>; he it was that led them through the Wilder|ne&s;s to prove them and to try them; and fi|nally he it was that brought them to the good Land, which, was a Figure of the hea|venly <HI>Canaan,</HI> or Place of Re&s;t. And as the great Work of travelling from <HI>Egypt</HI> to the Land of Promi&s;e outwardly was compleated in time through Faith and Patience in them that continued faithful to the End, and as tho&s;e were &s;aved by that divine Power they tru&s;ted in; &s;o undoubtedly &s;hall every one be in this Day, that retain their Integrity to God in the &s;ame Faith and Spirit that they did. But we find there were but few of that great Number which came out of <HI>Egypt</HI> entred into the good Land: For tho' they &s;aw the mighty Works which were done for their Pre&s;ervation, &s;uch was the Hardne&s;s of their Hearts, they daily provoked God to Wrath, in &s;o much that he threatned to de&s;troy them, and &s;aid to his Servant <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> Now therefore, let me alone, that my Wrath may wax hot again&s;t them; for I will con&s;ume them; but I will make of thee a mighty People. But <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> prayed unto the Lord his God to turn away his Wrath from his People; and the Lord heard his Prayer and &s;pared them. Thus we &s;ee <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> under the Law became a Mediator for the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="004327_0012_10045549D6311B48">
a lively Type and Figure of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> under the Go&s;pel, who ever lives to make Interce&s;&s;ion for the Sins of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> made Interce&s;&s;ion for the People under his Conduct; but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> makes Inter|ce&s;&s;ion for the whole World, that all Men through him might be &s;aved. And it is certain, that, as he &s;hed his precious Blood for the Sins of the whole World, &s;o all that will come and abide with him, &s;hall be &s;aved by him; as the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> plainly de|clares, <HI>Look unto me, and be ye &s;aved all the Ends of the Earth; for I am GOD, and there is none other,</HI> [or as &s;ome Tran&s;lations render it, <HI>none el&s;e,</HI> which is of the &s;ame Effect,] I&s;ai. XLV. 22. Here the Prophet directs Man to look unto him, and not to outward Ob&s;ervations: No, no; for his Me&s;&s;age was of another Tendency; the&s;e were as Sha|dows that pa&s;&s;ed away, they all directed to him, and centred in him. This I lay down for Chri&s;tian Doctrine, not to be confuted by the wi&s;e and learned in worldly Wi&s;dom: For it is not all the learned Men in the World by their Learning in Tongues and Books, can bring Men to the &s;aving Knowledge of Chri&s;t; for <HI>Paul</HI> whil&s;t he followed human Learning, and fed upon the Leaves of the Tree of Knowledge, per&s;ecuted the Church of Chri&s;t which were gathered by the Spi|rit
<PB N="13" REF="004327_0013_1004554F3A3A8650">
of which; but when by that Spirit he was enlightned, not con&s;ulting with Fle&s;h and Blood, he &s;oon learned another Le&s;&s;on; it was then no more Book-Learning, but Sav|ing Knowledge he exhorted Men to, and that was Chri&s;t in them the Hope of Glory; here <HI>Paul</HI> centred, he was at his Journy's End, his Travel was to bring Men to Chri&s;t, this was the End of his Me&s;&s;age, he was not &s;ent to baptize, but to preach the Go&s;pel, which Go&s;pel is Chri&s;t the Power of God unto Salvation; this Go&s;pel teaches Men perfect Faith in Chri&s;t, there is no waveing, there is no running from one Place to an|other, no; Chri&s;t is come the Hope of their Salvation, he it is they believe in, he it is they look unto, and by him they are &s;aved. To multiply Words upon this Head is need|le&s;s; for all Men profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity will in Words own Chri&s;t Je&s;us to be their Sa|viour: This is a general Confe&s;&s;ion Men make; but they will not come to him in that way he requires that they may be &s;aved by him. He &s;aith, <HI>God is a Spirit, and they that wor&s;hip him, mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in Spirit and in Truth:</HI> This is the Way he directs Men to; then certainly if it be in Spirit &amp; Truth, Men mu&s;t wor&s;hip God; they mu&s;t have a Mea&s;ure of that Divine Spirit to wor|&s;hip withal, which leads from the Teaching
<PB N="14" REF="004327_0014_1004555E1A378470">
that is meerly of Men, and out of the World from the Noi&s;e of Lo! here and Lo! there.</P>
<P>Oh! how full is the World of Forms and Opinions! One admires one Form, and an|other another Form: But the Spirit of Truth leads out of empty Forms to Life and Sub|&s;tance; yea, into all Truth, as tho&s;e that are led by it do certainly know. It therefore behoves all to beware of a Spirit of Unbe|lief; for that ble&s;&s;ed immaculate Lamb of God, when he was upon the Earth in that prepared Body his Father gave him to do his Will in, and who did the Works that no Man could do; yet &s;uch was the Hardheart|edne&s;s and Unbelief of the Jews, they believed not in him, but &s;aid, He hath a Devil, why hear ye he him? Others more moderate &s;aid, Which of the Rulers hath believed on him? Bring this home to the Age we live in, and it runs too like a Parallel with many: For now, to &s;peak of the Light of Chri&s;t within Man for a Teacher, gives great Of|fence; his divine Revelations to Mankind are disbelieved by many Wi&s;e and Learned in worldly Wi&s;dom; many of them &s;ay, Revelation is cea&s;ed, Men mu&s;t look to the Word of God and his Mini&s;ters to be direc|ted in the Way in which they are to go: And the holy Bible is what they call the Word of God, &amp; the learned Men in Tongues
<PB N="15" REF="004327_0015_1004556448E05E90">
they call the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t; although they never were &s;ent by Chri&s;t to preach the Go&s;pel. Now, this is the very Rock the Jews &s;plit upon, when Chri&s;t came in the Fle&s;h; they had the Law and the Prophets, by which they had a Hi&s;torical Belief of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> reading of him in tho&s;e holy Writings, which directed them to believe in the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> who was to come, and of whom <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a lively Type and Figure: Yet, when the ful|ne&s;s of Time was come, they rejected <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> re&s;ting in the formal Part of tho&s;e figurative Things, which pointed to him the Sub&s;tance, and through the Hardne&s;s of their Hearts they crucified him, and &s;aid, <HI>His Blood be on us and our Children.</HI> A dreadful thing indeed! that Man which was created a noble Crea|ture, and bore the heavenly Image in his State of Innocency, &s;hould fall &s;o far below his Station!</P>
<P>Now, what do they do better, that deny him in his &s;piritual Appearance, and cry, Revelation is cea&s;ed, our Mini&s;ters tell us &s;o; and &s;ure, they who are learned Men know better than we, therefore let us hear them; often making u&s;e of that Text, <HI>The Prie&s;t's Lips &s;hall pre&s;erve Knowledge.</HI> Under the Law it was &s;o; but under the Go&s;pel-Di&s;pen&s;a|tion <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the high <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> and Bi&s;hop of our Souls, and to him we mu&s;t adhere.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004327_0016_1004556D5C0CA230">Now, from the foregoing Ob&s;ervations I hope it is plain, That Revelation is not cea|&s;ed: For if that be cea&s;ed, by what Spirit mu&s;t Man learn to know his Duty? God gave Man in the Beginning his good Spirit to be a Leader, and there was no other way whereby he was led to God but that. But Man's rebelling again&s;t it incurred his Wrath to the di&s;obedient; this was the Ca&s;e of <HI>Adam</HI> in the Fall: Yet God through the Son of his Love extended his Mercy to Mankind, that by Repentance and Faith in him they might be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Now, through all Ages of the World the Upright in Heart &s;aw the Day of their Re|demption, and rejoyed therein. Time would &s;ail to enumerate what might be writ in Defence of the Truth I contend for. Should I trace the holy Scriptures throughout, it would &s;well to a large Volume; and I &s;ee no great Nece&s;&s;ity for it: They are plain and clear in them&s;elves, and tho&s;e who are led by the Spirit of Truth may read them with Comfort; but tho&s;e that reject that Spirit, they are a My&s;tery unto, and &s;o will remain till they come to be led by it: For it is the Spirit of Truth that gave forth the Scriptures, which can only un&s;eal them and no other; and without this, neither learned nor unlearned can ever lead them to Edifi|cation.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="004327_0017_1004557AC47E5848">Yet to confirm the foregoing, I &s;hall add what the Wi&s;e Man &s;ays concerning Chri&s;t: <HI>The Lord po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me in the Beginning of his way before his Works of old: I was &s;et up from everla&s;ting, from the Beginning, or ever the Earth was. When there were no Depths, I was brought forth; when there were no Fountains abounding with Water: Before the Mountains were &s;ettled, before the Hills was I brought forth; while as yet he had not made the Earth, nor the Fields, nor the highe&s;t part of the Du&s;t of the World: When he prepared the Heavens, I was there; when he &s;et a Compa&s;s upon the Face of the Deep; when he e&s;tabli&s;hed the Clouds above; when he &s;trengthned the Fountains of the Deep; when he gave to the Sea his Decree, that the Waters &s;hould not pa&s;s his Commandment; when he appointed the Foundations of the Earth; then I was by him, as one brought up with him; and I was daily his Delight, rejoycing always be|fore him; rejoycing in the habitable part of his Earth, and my Delights were with the Sons of Men.</HI> Prov. VIII. 22, to 31. Now, the Com|pa&s;s of his Earth which he took Delight in, was Man, that he had made for a Purpo&s;e of his own Glory; he made him of the Du&s;t of the Earth, and breathed into him the Spirit of Life, and Man became a living Soul. This was the habitable Part of his Earth he took Delight to &s;olace in; and a

heavenly Solace it was to Man, whil&s;t he &s;tood in the State he was created in: But falling through Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, he lo&s;t that heavenly Enjoyment, which is only renew|ed again in Chri&s;t the Lamb of God, who never fell; and is the only Means of Man's Salvation. And &s;eeing then he is the Means, let us come to him for the Effect. And the Way to come to him, is through the divine Influence of the Spirit of Grace, which pro|ceeds from the Father and the Son, who are one. To confirm this my A&s;&s;ertion, I &s;hall quote divers Texts of Scripture, &s;ufficient to prove it to Men of common Capacities.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with Chri&s;t's own Words: <HI>Verily, verily I &s;ay unto you, He that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that &s;ent me, hath everla&s;ting Life, and &s;hall not come into Condemnation, but is pa&s;&s;ed from Death unto Life,</HI> John V. 24. Here the Doctrine I ad|vance is &s;o plain and intelligibly laid down by the Lip of Truth, that it needs no Com|ment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next add the Te&s;timony of &s;ome of his Followers: The Evangeli&s;t <HI>John</HI> &s;ays, <HI>God &s;o loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Life: For God &s;ent not his Son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World through him
<PB N="19" REF="004327_0019_1004558D81E513B0">
might be &s;aved,</HI> John III. 16, 17. Oh! the Harmony there is betwixt the Lamb of God and his Followers! 'Tis &s;weetly Refre&s;hing to read tho&s;e holy Lines, by &s;uch as are gathered unto Chri&s;t by his Spirit.</P>
<P>My next In&s;tance parallel to the Subject I am upon, to wit, <HI>CHRIST the Eternal WORD the only Means of Man's Salvation,</HI> is that of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who &s;aith, <HI>Mo&s;es de&s;cribeth the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law, That the Man which doth tho&s;e things, &s;hall live by them. But the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of Faith &s;peaketh on this wi&s;e, Say not in thine Heart, who &s;hall a&s;cend into Heaven? (that is, to bring Chri&s;t down from above) or who &s;hall de&s;cend into the Deep? (that is, to bring up Chri&s;t again from the Dead) But what &s;aith it? The Word is nigh thee, even in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, (that is, the Word of Faith which we preach) That if thou &s;halt con|fe&s;s with thy Mouth the Lord Je&s;us, and &s;halt believe in thine Heart, that God hath rai&s;ed him from the Dead, thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI> Rom. X. 5, to 9.</P>
<P>Now, this is the Word which the faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t preach, and exhort Men to; and this they do by the divine Influence of the Spirit of Grace, revealed unto them: For no Man can truly &s;peak or write of the Things of God but by the In&s;piration of the
<PB N="20" REF="004327_0020_100455925CE216B8">
Spirit of Truth; for God is inacce&s;&s;ible in his own pure E&s;&s;ence and Being, and cannot be approach'd to by Man, without the Di|vine Influence of a ble&s;&s;ed Mediator, which is Chri&s;t the Hope of Glory to all them that believe. Such the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> prea|ched; but how did he preach? by human Learning only? no; for in that &s;tate he per&s;ecuted the Church of Chri&s;t: But he plainly tells us, how he came to be a Mi|ni&s;ter of Chri&s;t; hear what he &s;ays: <HI>But I certify you, Brethren, that the Go&s;pel which was preached of me, is not after Man: For I neither received it of Man, neither was I taught it but by the Revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Galat. I. 11, 12. My Reader may, if he plea&s;eth, read the whole Chapter for further Information, where he treats of this Matter at large, as well as in many other Places in his Writings; of which for Brevity-&s;ake I &s;hall in&s;tance but few; every one may read them with Profit, if they will follow the Spirit of Truth; and without that, their reading will do them no good: For if they reject the Fountain from whence good comes, how can they drink of the Streams of it? But to return to <HI>Paul's</HI> Account, how he came to be a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, hear his own Words: <HI>For this Cau&s;e I Paul the Pri|&s;oner of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for you Gentiles; if ye
<PB N="21" REF="004327_0021_1004559EDB1BDD78">
have heard of the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Grace of God, which is given me to you-ward: How that by Revelation he made known unto me the My&s;tery, that I wrote afore in few Words</HI>; he yet goes on, <HI>whereby,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>when ye read ye may under&s;tand my Knowledge in the My&s;tery of Chri&s;t,</HI> Ephe&s;. III. 1, 2, 3, 4. Here <HI>Paul</HI> declares how he came to be a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and tells the Cau&s;es to the Gentiles: Now, if Revelation be cea&s;ed, as many Scho|lars and learned Men have affirmed, how &s;hall Men come to the Knowledge of God, &s;ince our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;ays, <HI>All things are delivered unto me of my Father, and no Man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any Man the Father &s;ave the Son, and he to whom|&s;oever the Son will reveal him</HI>? Matth. XI. 27. Such evident Proof from the holy Writ, one would think were enough to convince all who gain&s;ay it.</P>
<P>Seeing then there is no other way to come to the Knowledge of God, but by Divine Revelation, it is a great Error in Men to deny that which is E&s;&s;ential to Salvation. This Error crept into the World &s;ince the Apo&s;tles Days, by going from the Spirit of Truth, and &s;etting up Idols in its Place, like the Jews of old, who &s;et up a Calf in the Wilderne&s;s, through which they were pa&s;|&s;ing towards the good Land, and cryed,
<PB N="22" REF="004327_0022_100455D29CA27D78">
<HI>The&s;e be thy Gods, O I&s;rael, that brought thee out of Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>Now, when Men's Hearts are gone from the Lord, they run into Idolatry, and &s;et up &s;omething in their own Will, to plea&s;e their own Minds; and whil&s;t they continue in this impenitent State, to &s;uch Revelation may cea&s;e: For the Lord hath &s;aid, <HI>My Spi|rit &s;hall not always &s;trive with Man</HI>; although God in his Mercy to Man (whom he created for a Purpo&s;e of his own Glory) gave him a Mea&s;ure of his good Spirit to lead him, and invites all in the Son of his Love, &s;aying, <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Re&s;t.</HI> Now, it is certain, there is no greater Burthen than Sin, and no greater need of Re&s;t than to cea&s;e from it; which is altogether impo&s;&s;ible to be done, if Revelation be cea&s;ed: For <HI>no Man knoweth the Son, but the Father, neither knoweth any Man the Father &s;ave the Son, and he to whom&s;oever the Son will reveal him</HI>: This is confirmed by the Lip of Truth, and the whole World can never rever&s;e it. Now, how the Wi&s;e and Learned Men can &s;tem the Current of this Te&s;timony, I cannot &s;ee. If they deny Revelation, what Spirit mu&s;t they learn of, to teach Men to come to Chri&s;t? For there is the Center of all Chri&s;tian Doc|trine; and if Men deny the Way that leads

<P>Then you are like the Waves of the Sea, to&s;&s;ed about with every Wind, and un&s;table in all your Ways, and can look for no good thing at the Lord's Hand.

<P>Here we may &s;ee, how valiant the Martyr was for the Truth, which he had learned through the Grace of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,
<PB N="34" REF="004327_0034_100412C1AB0D5108">
which Grace led him into all Truth; and that Grace and Spirit &s;upported him tri|umphingly through all tho&s;e fiery Trials. But hear yet further this holy Man, what a Godly Zeal he had for God in his Day: <HI>No Man,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>can believe that Je&s;us is Lord, but by the Holy Gho&s;t: For he that hath not the Spirit of Chri&s;t, is none of his.</HI> And again, <HI>We have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba Father; the &s;ame Spirit certifieth us that we are the Sons of God.</HI> Al&s;o <HI>John</HI> &s;aith, <HI>He that believeth not, that Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h, is an Antichri&s;t, and de|nyeth both the Father and the Son:</HI> Further adding, <HI>And he that believeth in God, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Julius Palmer</HI> at <HI>Newberry,</HI> before Doctor <HI>Jeffries,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sarum,</HI> and others, gives this Account of his Faith and Hope in the Lord, being enabled by the Spirit of Truth &s;o to do. After many needle&s;s Que&s;tions put to him, he an&s;wered very boldy in the Lord:</P>
<P>I know, that of my &s;elf I am able to do nothing; yet if you and all mine Enemies &s;hould do your wor&s;t, you &s;hall not be able to bring that to pa&s;s, [meaning to bring him to their Super&s;tition] neither &s;hall you pre|vail again&s;t God's mighty Spirit, by which we under&s;tand the Truth, and &s;peak it &s;o boldly.</P>

<P>No Man can believe but by the In&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t; there|fore, if I were not a &s;piritual Man and in|&s;pired with God's Holy Spirit, I were not a true Chri&s;tian; he that hath not the Spi|rit of Chri&s;t, is none of his.</P>

<PB N="36" REF="004327_0036_1004561CAE22CA80">
thou pre&s;ume to offer Di&s;putation, or to encounter with a Doctor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Palmer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Remember Mr. Doctor, <HI>The Spirit breatheth where it plea&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. And, <HI>Out of the Mouth of Babes</HI> &amp;c. And, <HI>Thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e Things from the Wi&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. God is not tied to Time, Wit, Learning, Place, nor Per&s;on. Thus far that worthy Martyr <HI>Palmer.</HI> And had the Envy of that Age thought on it, might have branded him for a <HI>Quaker,</HI> with many more of tho&s;e who were faithful in their Day; divers of whom, according to the Book of <HI>Martyrs,</HI> preached again&s;t <HI>Tythes</HI> and <HI>Swearing upon a Book,</HI> and that &s;ome worthy <HI>Women preached,</HI> who were joyned to Chri&s;t's little Flock.</P>
<P><HI>Agnes A&s;hford,</HI> being one of the &s;aid People, for preaching the&s;e Words following, was articled again&s;t, viz. <HI>We be the Salt of the Earth; if it be putrified and vani&s;hed away, it is nothing worth: A City upon a Hill may not be hid: Ye light not a Candle and put it under a Bu&s;hel, but &s;et it on a Candle&s;tick, that it may give a Light to all in the Hou&s;e: So &s;hine your Light before Men, that they may &s;ee your Works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</HI> And further &s;he did teach, &s;aying, <HI>Je&s;us &s;eeing his People, as he went up a Hill, was &s;et, and his Di&s;ciples came to him, he o|pened his Mouth and taught them, &s;aying, Ble&s;&s;ed
<PB N="37" REF="004327_0037_100412C6589D1238">
be the poor Men in Spirit; for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs: Ble&s;&s;ed be the mild Men; for they &s;hall rule the Earth.</HI> For teaching this Doctrine, the Bi&s;hop &s;trictly enjoyned and commanded her to teach no more Le&s;&s;ons to any Men, e&s;pecially to her Children.</P>
<P>Many more might be in&s;tanced out of the Book of <HI>Martyrs,</HI> which I omit for Brevi|ty's &s;ake, which &s;hewed their Chri&s;tian Zeal, and what Spirit they were led by, how the the Doctrine they taught agrees with the Doctrine of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> in this Day. For let Men draw up what Forms they will, and make what Shew of Wor&s;hip they will; till they come to know Chri&s;t to be their Teacher through the divine Influ|ence of the Holy Spirit of Grace which pro|ceeds from the Father and the Son, they wor&s;hip but an Image, a Shadow in &s;tead of a Sub&s;tance.</P>
</SP>
<P>So this I do affirm and lay down for Chri|&s;tian Doctrine, <HI>CHRIST JESUS which was with the Father before the World was, by whom all Things were made, this is the WORD we mu&s;t hear, this is the Teacher we mu&s;t learn of.</HI> 'Tis not the Forms Men can make will bring the Soul true Peace, no, 'tis nothing but that WORD that gave it a Being can give it Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="004327_0038_1004562F313B3DB0">Now, if Men would come to be led by the Spirit of Truth, they would &s;oon leave off Contention, and be of the <HI>Woman of Sa|maria's</HI> Mind, <HI>Come &s;ee a Man that told me all that ever I did:</HI> Is not this the <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>? Here &s;he was touch'd with a lively Sen&s;e by the divine Influence of the Holy Spirit; and her Fellow-Citizens when they heard the &s;ame Chri&s;t, they came to be of the &s;ame Mind &s;he was of; their Eyes were then no more to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> no more to the Mount; no, a Saviour was come, and him they believed in. Oh! then the Angel of his Pre&s;ence was come; Oh! then the Fountain was open; <HI>Drink, and thir&s;t no more:</HI> Oh! ble&s;&s;ed En|joyment, O! heavenly Solace! what would Man have more? O! that Men would prize the Mercy offered to them in this the Day of his Love, and come to drink of this Foun|tain that &s;prings up to Eternal Life; and not break their own Peace by chu&s;ing Dark|ne&s;s rather than Light, which leads to the Chambers of Death.</P>
<P>So <HI>Friendly Reader,</HI> thou ha&s;t a Soul to &s;ave, or to lo&s;e, and Life and Death is &s;et before thee; a Saviour is nigh unto all, that all may be &s;aved by him; there's none ex|empted that will come to him: And in Or|der that thou may&s;t come to him, he has given thee a Mea&s;ure of his good Spirit to
<PB N="39" REF="004327_0039_100412CD9C2C5760">
lead thee: This it is thy Duty to hear, to follow, and to obey: It proceeded from him, and it will lead to him. Time would fail to &s;ay all that might be &s;aid or writ on this Subject, to wit, <HI>CHRIST the Teacher of his People.</HI> And there are many Volumes ex|tant wrote by worthy Men, who are gone to their Re&s;t, and who&s;e Works follow them, who&s;e Memory is dear to Po&s;terity. There|fore I &s;hall draw to a Conclu&s;ion, greatly de&s;iring all the Inhabitants of this Land may prize the Day of Mercy while it is cal|led <HI>To Day.</HI> You have enjoyed great Ble&s;|&s;ings beyond many Nations: You have had the Angel of his Pre&s;ence to &s;urround you, when many have been involved in Blood: Have a Care you don't incur his Wrath upon you by your Di&s;obedience; for he is a God of Ju&s;tice as well as of Mercy. My hone&s;t Caution can do no Harm, if it finds no Room in the Crowd of worldly Minds.</P>
<P>So to CHRIST the WORD nigh in the Heart I recommend my <HI>Reader</HI>; there's no other Way will bring the Soul to Peace: And &s;hall conclude this little Piece with the <HI>Supplication</HI> following:</P>
<P><HI>AND now, O LORD, if it &s;tands good with thy Divine Will, cau&s;e thou the Light of thy Countenance to &s;hine upon the Children of
<PB N="40" REF="004327_0040_100455CF4C264A60">
Men, whom thou ha&s;t created for a Purpo&s;e of thy Glory: Let the Sun of thy Love ari&s;e and &s;hine more and more upon them, that they may &s;ee the Day of their Redemption, and thereby livingly come to prai&s;e thee. And tho&s;e that are in Darkne&s;s and Hardne&s;s of Heart, O LORD enlighten their Under&s;tandings, and tender their hard Hearts, in Order to their Salvation. Keep tho&s;e that are in thy Way to the End of their Pilgrimage: And tho&s;e who are wandring from thy Pold, do thou be plea&s;ed to bring Home, that they may come to wor&s;hip thee the true GOD in thy own Way. Grant this, O LORD, to the Children of Men, in and through thy dearly beloved Son, our ble&s;&s;ed LORD and dear Redeemer JESUS CHRIST. To whom with thee be all Glory and Honour a&s;cribed now and for evermore.</HI> Amen.</P>
