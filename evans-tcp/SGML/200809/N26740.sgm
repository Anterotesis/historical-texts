<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SOON after the commencement of the late Malig|nant Fever in our city, a &s;hort account of which is now laid before the Public, two of my particular friends were &s;eized with all its &s;ymptoms. On them, I thought it my duty to attend, that I might render &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as lay in my power. A few days after the di&s;ea&s;e began to &s;pread its direful influence in the vicinity of my place of re&s;idence, and I re&s;olved to pay the &s;ame attention to my neighbours as I was willing to do to my friends. For this re&s;olution, however, I claim no merit; For as the &s;ituation of my family was &s;uch as to render it improper, at lea&s;t inconvenient to move, and finding my&s;elf &s;ur|rounded with pe&s;tilence, I firmly believed, that I was equally &s;afe, while performing the common duties of hu|manity, to the afflicted, as &s;itting u&s;ele&s;s in my own ap|partment; nay more, had I remained inactive, my mind might have become a prey to melancholy, and I &s;hould, in all probability, have been oppre&s;&s;ed with fear, than which there is not a greater predi&s;ponent cau&s;e to di&s;or|der, nor perhaps an equal cau&s;e in making its termina|tion fatal. Rea&s;oning in this manner, and tru&s;ting in Divine Providence for protection, I therefore determi|ned to make no he&s;itation in vi&s;iting any &s;ick per&s;on to whom I could be u&s;eful.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="035586_0003_1005F5D839B61028">
On the 1&s;t September, the Health Commi&s;&s;ioners having heard that I was not afraid of &s;eeing the infected, wi&s;hed me to enter into their &s;ervice. I agreed, and from that day continued employed by them, and after|wards by the Health Committee, till the termination of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, I had daily opportunities of &s;eeing the progre&s;s of the fever, the treatment of the &s;ick, the manner in which the poor were relieved, &amp;c. and as the Magi&s;trates were &s;o obliging as to permit me to have recour&s;e to their papers for information with re&s;pect to the donations, and the names of the dead, I was induced to venture on the pre&s;ent publication.</P>
<P>My aim, in every page, has been truth and accura|cy, without embelli&s;hment. How far I have &s;ucceed|ed, I cannot at pre&s;ent determine; but of this I am cer|tain, I meant well, and have u&s;ed my utmo&s;t endeavour to render the work as &s;atisfactory to the public, as po&s;|&s;ible.</P>

AN ACCOUNT OF THE MALIGNANT FEVER, LATETY PREVALENT IN NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="part">
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>State of NEW-YORK, previous to the commencement of the Malignant Fever.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN, in the month of July la&s;t, the public prints announced, that a pe&s;tilential fever had made its appear|ance in Philadelphia, the inhabitants of this city, received the information with &s;orrow. They felt for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their fellow-creatures, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time, they little thought, that a calamity of a &s;imilar nature was impending over them&s;elves. Our city was at that time repre&s;ented, and I believe, with truth, to be remarkably healthy. The greate&s;t attention was paid to cleaning our &s;treets, and the Health Phy&s;ician was vigilant in the di&s;charge of his duty. Hence as we apprehended no danger from the importation of pe&s;tilence, much le&s;s did we think that it could be en|gendered among&s;t our&s;elves. Our citizens in this &s;tate of &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ecurity, were chiefly bent on making prepara|tions to defend their liberty and independence again&s;t the aggre&s;&s;ions of a foreign foe.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e military a&s;&s;ociations were rapidly form|ed; companies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, compo|&s;ed of citizens of every age and &s;ituation in life, daily pa|raded to acquire the nece&s;&s;ary knowledge of the art of war; whil&s;t others were per&s;onally engaged in erecting fortifications at the battery, that we might be enabled to defend our&s;elves again&s;t the attacks of any invaders. Sub|&s;criptions, likewi&s;e, were rai&s;ed to a great amount, for the
<PB N="6" REF="035586_0005_1005F5DE35373310">
purpo&s;e of building ve&s;&s;els of war, to guard our coa&s;t and protect our commerce.</P>
<P>But in the mid&s;t of the&s;e mighty preparations, an enemy more terrible than any foreign nation, made its appearance and &s;pread havoc and de&s;truction in every direction. I mean the <HI>Yellow Fever.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the approach of this awful di&s;order, the bu&s;tle we were making for &s;elf-defence was &s;uddenly &s;u&s;pended; the warlike looks, which our citizens had a&s;&s;umed, changed in|to tho&s;e of di&s;may; the fortifications in a great mea&s;ure neglected; the military a&s;&s;ociations di&s;continued, and death, &s;peedy death, &s;eemed to be the indi&s;criminate por|tion of the inhabitants of this wealthy metropolis; for as it is well de&s;cribed in one of our public prints, "parents and children, hu&s;bands and wives, brothers and &s;i&s;ters were &s;uddenly torn from the feeling bo&s;oms of their rela|tives, while the mourning &s;urvivors were them&s;elves mo|mentarily expecting the &s;olemn call: The li&s;ping infant calling for its dead parents; and none but &s;trangers to af|ford relief; hou&s;es totally emptied of their inhabitants, and the citizens flying in every direction from the infected places, as from a conflagrated town, or falling tower; the con&s;tant hear&s;e in &s;able melancholy, conveying the victims of this direful calamity to their long home, and whole fa|milies in many in&s;tances cut off without a &s;ingle individual being Je&s;t." Many women who enjoyed ea&s;e and afflu|ence, are bereft of their hu&s;bands, and left to &s;truggle for the maintainance of numerous families of children, a ta&s;k for which they are but little qualified, and many orphans deprived of their parents, mu&s;t be brought up at the public expence; Divine Providence thus affording us an awful le&s;&s;on of the in&s;tability of human affairs, and teaching us, if we are not incorrigible, how ineffectual the exertions of men are, unle&s;s they be forwarded by the Deity. By this remark, however, I would by no means be under&s;tood as in&s;inuating, that the mea&s;ures we were adopting for the protection of our lives and property, and of our wives and children, were improper; on the contrary, I think it was the duty of every good citizen, to exert him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t on &s;uch an emergency; but I &s;hall certainly be excu&s;ed for making this ob&s;ervation, that when we are threatened with dangers of whatever nature, whil&s;t we en|deavour
<PB N="7" REF="035586_0006_1005F5DFC93FEF68">
by every means in our power to avert them, we &s;hould depend for &s;ucce&s;s not on our own exertions, but on the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e prefatory remarks, I &s;hall now proceed to the melancholy &s;ubject I have undertaken, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the hi&s;tory of a pe&s;tilential di&s;order, which, though it has at different times appeared in this city, particularly i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the year 1795, was never productive of half the calamity as in the months of Augu&s;t, September, and October, in the year 1798.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Fir&s;t appearance of the di&s;order&mdash;its progre&s;s and decline. Opinions concerning it various and contradictory.</HEAD>
<P>THE malignant Fever which committed &s;o dreadful ha|voc among&s;t the inhabitants of New-York, made its ap|pearance towards the end of July. Its fir&s;t victim, in all probability, was Mr. Melancton Smith, who died on the 28th or 29th of that month, after an illne&s;s of a very few days. His ca&s;e was &s;aid to be attended with the mo&s;t malignant &s;ymptoms; but &s;uch was the general opinion of the inhabitants with re&s;pect to the healthine&s;s of our city, that his death excited little or no alarm. Mr. Smith is &s;aid to have been taken &s;ick at his &s;tore, in Front &s;treet near Coenties-&s;lip, and a few days after his death, &s;everal per&s;ons were attacked with &s;ickne&s;s in that vicinity. The &s;ymptoms of their di&s;order, however, in general appear|ed to be &s;imilar to that of a <HI>common cold:</HI> they were, therefore, negligent in obtaining medical aid; hence the di&s;ea&s;e got the a&s;cendency before they were aware of their danger, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of phy&s;icians was procured too late. From what has come under my own ob&s;ervation, with re&s;pect to this di&s;order, I con&s;ider it to be highly proper for every individual, upon its appearance, to &s;end for a &s;killful phy&s;ician the <HI>moment</HI> he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s him|&s;elf taken with any &s;ort of &s;ickne&s;s; for the <HI>Yellow-Fever,</HI> in its attacks, is peculiarly in&s;idious; it a&s;&s;umes a variety of forms, and often that of a <HI>common cold,</HI> or &s;ome &s;light di&s;temper, for which mo&s;t people would think there was no nece&s;&s;ity for &s;eeking a remedy.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="035586_0007_1005F5E265567CA8">
Indeed, according to Doctor Ru&s;h, of Philadelphia, when a particular epidemic vi&s;its any &s;pot, every other complaint is at once ab&s;orbed, or lo&s;t with the then raging &s;ickne&s;s. This, I apprehend, is now the general opinion of our mo&s;t eminent phy&s;icians; and had it been generally believed by the inhabitants of New-York, I am almo&s;t convinced that the havoc in our city would have by no means been &s;o great as it was; for I have little doubt that more than one half of tho&s;e to whom the di&s;order proved fatal, might in all probability have been now in good health, had they, on the fir&s;t attack, applied the proper remedies; and &s;hould this, or any other city in the Uni|ted States, be again afflicted by a &s;imilar calamity, (which God forbid) as a friend to my fellow citizens, I would u&s;e my utmo&s;t endeavours, in pre&s;&s;ing this truth upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inds, that in &s;uch a &s;ituation, <HI>delays are peculiarly dangerous</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the progre&s;s of the di&s;temper.&mdash;</P>
<P>Whether any ca&s;es of pe&s;tilential fever exi&s;ted in the earlier part of Augu&s;t, remote from the place where it was believed to have originated, I have not been able to a&s;certain: But of this I am certain, that about the 20th of the month, ca&s;es of a highly malignant nature appear|ed in various parts of the city, and in particular it began to range with great violence at the New Slip, in Cliff-&s;treet and John-&s;treet, but more e&s;pecially in Eden's-Alley and Rider-&s;treet, where not a family e&s;caped it, nor was there a hou&s;e in which it made its appearance, except two, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that of Mr. M'Ma&s;ters and me, where it did not termi|nate fatally to one or more individuals. About the &s;ame time it likewi&s;e &s;pread its ravages in Ann-&s;treet, Fair-&s;treet, Cherry-&s;treet, Augu&s;tus-&s;treet, and al&s;o at the &s;hip yards, and about the beginning of September, I know of few places in the city where there were not &s;ome &s;olitary ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Our Health-Commi&s;&s;ioners began to be &s;omewhat ap|prehen&s;ive with regard to the appearance of this pe&s;tilence &s;o early as the 6th of Augu&s;t, as may be &s;een from the following letter addre&s;&s;ed to the Mayor:&mdash;</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE unfini&s;hed &s;ituation of the docks in Front-&s;treet, between Coenties and the Old-&s;lip, generally, was, in the opinion of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Health-Office, a &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;e in that neighbourhood la&s;t year, and oc|ca&s;ioned the death of &s;everal valuable citizens. At that period it became a &s;ubject of remon&s;trance to the Com|mon Council.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners cannot &s;ufficiently regret, that they have rea&s;on to renew their remon&s;trances on this &s;ubject, and that its pre&s;ent &s;ituation is likely to be productive of &s;till greater evils than tho&s;e of la&s;t year.</P>
<P>Several per&s;ons have &s;ickened in the neighbourhood of the&s;e unfini&s;hed grounds within a week, and with &s;ymp|toms &s;trikingly characteri&s;tic of Yellow-Fever.</P>
<P>If the Common Council think proper to appoint two of their members, the Commi&s;&s;ioners will meet them early to-morrow-morning, to concert mea&s;ures adapted to the exigency of the ca&s;e.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>On the &s;ame day they i&s;&s;ued an adverti&s;ement, notifying their determination to put the laws in force with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who &s;hould be delinquent in regard to keeping the &s;treets clean, before their re&s;pective doors, and in remov|ing dirt from their yards and cellars, adding that the &s;treet in&s;pectors, who&s;e immediate duty it was to attend to that bu&s;ine&s;s, were directed to report all offences of this nature to the police, and that the penalty again&s;t offenders would be rigidly exacted.</P>
<P>At the time of this adverti&s;ement, however, it was re|marked both by citizens and &s;trangers, that our &s;treets were kept uncommonly clean; but with re&s;pect to yards and cellars, I have rea&s;on to believe that, to the di&s;grace of &s;ome individuals, it was in &s;ome ca&s;es otherwi&s;e;&mdash;and I may add, that where &s;uch nui&s;ances have exi&s;ted, the in|habitants
<PB N="10" REF="035586_0009_1005F5E6DBE2DEC8">
of that vicinity have generally been the &s;evere&s;t &s;ufferers.</P>
<P>By &s;ome people our Commi&s;&s;ioners have been cen&s;ured for neglecting to notify the citizens <HI>officially</HI> of the danger to which they were expo&s;ed, &s;o &s;oon as they became ac|quainted with the exi&s;tence of any malignant or pe&s;ti|lential fever in the city. Such cen&s;ure, however, ap|pears, to me to be very unju&s;t: for the exi&s;tence of &s;ome ca&s;es of fever was univer&s;ally known towards the middle of Augu&s;t, and became the &s;ubject of general con|ver&s;ation. The Commi&s;&s;ioners never denied it, nor did they attempt to conceal it: But as it was the opinion of mo&s;t people, that it was not probable the di&s;order would &s;pread, and that it would vani&s;h after &s;acrificing a few indi|viduals, as had happened in the years 1796 and 1797, &s;uch a publication, whil&s;t it could have been of no u&s;e to the inhabitants, who were well acquainted with their &s;ituation, might have been highly prejudicial to our commerce, by deterring country people from coming among&s;t them, at a time, when according to every appearance, they could pa&s;s and repa&s;s to our city in perfect &s;afety, and without running any ri&s;que of receiving infection.</P>
<P>On the 12th, 13th, and 14th of Augu&s;t, there was heavy &s;howers of rain; that on the 14th, commenced at four in in the morning, and continued without the lea&s;t intermi&s;|&s;ion, until nine with con&s;iderable thunder: The quantity which fell during the&s;e five hours, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be greater than had at any time fallen, during the &s;ame &s;pace of time for many years. The &s;treets were covered with water, in many places knee deep, and a va&s;t number of cellars were filled with it.</P>
<P>It was at the time, generally believed, that this exce&s;&s;ive rain and thunder would &s;o purify the air, that our city would in a few days be totally exempt from any ca&s;es of the di&s;order, but alas! our expectations in this re&s;pect, were dreadfully di&s;appointed: for from this day, it almo&s;t immediately began to &s;pread in every direction. But, however erroneous, the ideas of many have been with re&s;pect to this circum&s;tance, &s;everals thought very differ|ently; in particular, a writer in the Commercial Adverti|&s;er, on the evening of the 14th, the day on which this exce&s;&s;ive rain fell, who &s;eems to have fore&s;een what would
<PB N="11" REF="035586_0010_1005F5E88446DD28">
been the true con&s;equences of it. His language is &s;o re|markable that I cannot forbear to quote it. "The im|men&s;e bodies of water" &s;ays he, "which have lately fallen, whil&s;t it &s;eems to clean&s;e the &s;treets, &s;hould excite a degree of &s;erious alarm, when the effects of its remaining &s;tagnant is con&s;idered. Many cellars mu&s;t no doubt have been the receptacle for much of the rain which has fallen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; it therefore behoves every per&s;on, <HI>without delay,</HI> to examine their cell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rs and other places, which are likely to become re&s;ervoirs of water, and &s;hould any be found, immediate &s;teps &s;hould be taken to remove it. Stagnant water in confined places, during this hot weather, will, in two days, exhale a pe&s;tilent water, which may generate the mo&s;t dangerous infectious di&s;orders, to prevent which, af|ter the removal of the water, a liberal u&s;e of lime &s;hould be made by &s;cattering it over the cellar. It is to be hoped that a regard to &s;elf-pre&s;ervation will produce the mo&s;t prompt and active exertions towards this alarming object; tho&s;e who neglect it, will be among&s;t the fir&s;t victims of a ravaging di&s;ea&s;e, which a little timely attention might have kept from our at pre&s;ent healthy city-"</P>
<P>A day or two after, in the &s;ame paper, a writer, after mentioning the late floods of water, ob&s;erves, that&punc; "If immediate and vigorous mea&s;ures are not taken to oblige people to have their cellars emptied and well ventilated and dried, one week will produce in this city, a more malignant &s;ickne&s;s than Philadelphia now experiences, or than New-York has witne&s;&s;ed &s;ince its fir&s;t &s;ettlement."</P>
<P>My intention in quoting the&s;e extracts, is to put our ci|tizens on guard again&s;t an indolent &s;ecurity, &s;hould we be again attacked by the Yellow-Fever: For heat and moi&s;|ture combined will ever produce putrid vapours, and the&s;e, from the earlie&s;t ages of phy&s;ic, have been almo&s;t univer&s;ally allowed to be the &s;ource of pe&s;tilential di&s;|orders.</P>
<P>Our Health-Commi&s;&s;ioners, on this occa&s;ion, certain|ly de&s;erved well of the public. Their u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mo&s;t endeavours were exerted to have every nui&s;ance removed, and as far as lay in their power, to prevent the &s;preading of the di&s;|ea&s;e, with which we then began to be afflicted. Their en|deavours, however, were ineffectual, as the number of deaths from this time almo&s;t daily encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="035586_0011_1005F5EAD928FAA0">
About the 24th numbers began to leave the city, and many of tho&s;e who had offices for the tran&s;action of bu&s;i|ne&s;s in that part of the city which lies toward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Ea&s;t Ri|ver, moved to Broadway, which was deemed more heal|thy. The Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, likewi&s;e, in Mill-&s;treet, and the In&s;urance-Office in Water-&s;treet, were fixed for the time in the Tontine-City-Tavern, in Broadway. During the whole month of Augu&s;t, the number of deaths amount|ed to one hundred and thirty three men, fifty five women, and one hundred and forty one children, making in all three hundred and twenty nine. As particular attention had not been hitherto paid by the &s;extons to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e who fell victims to the fever, from tho&s;e who had died of any other di&s;order, it is difficult to a&s;certain their p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eci&s;e numbers. Perhaps, if it be fixed at one hundred, we &s;hall not be far from the truth, particularly as it is certain that by far the greate&s;t number of the children were cut off by the flux, a di&s;order which generally proves fa|tal to infants at this &s;ea&s;on of the year. On the 15th Au|gu&s;t the deaths were 14, from which day the number was &s;till progre&s;&s;ing, &s;o that on the 1&s;t September, they amount-to 23. The daily average during Augu&s;t was about 12.</P>
<P>On the 15th of Sept. the number of funerals were 38, on the awful 19th, they were no le&s;s than 63, and on each of the two days following, they were reduced to 40, from which circum&s;tance we began to entertain hopes that our mortal foe was about to leave us, but we were again di&s;|appointed, for the next four days it kept fluctuating be|tween 41 and 50, and on the 26th <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e up to 60. The total number of deaths, during this month, was eleven hundred and fifty two, of whom nine hundred and fifty four died of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ever. Six hundred and forty eight, were men, three hundred and fifty four women, and and one hundred and fifty two children. The daily average thro' the month was about 38. By the 15th of this month, our &s;ituation was known at a di&s;tance, as on that day a procla|mation was i&s;&s;ued by James Cahoun, e&s;qr Mayor of Bal|timore, prohibiting the entrance into the city of Baltimore or within three miles thereof, of all per&s;ons whom&s;oever, who had come from the cities of New-York or Philadel|phia, or from Wilmington in the &s;tate of Delaware, and forbidding the citizens of Baltimore from having any

communication with them, until they could produce an ap|proved certificate of their ab&s;ence from tho&s;e places at lea&s;t 15 days previous thereto.</P>
<P>Our number of dead on the 1&s;t October was 43, and this was the greate&s;t number during the whole month. On the 18th it was reduced to 16, and on the 21&s;t it only a|mounted to 9. After this, the number of deaths on any one day during the exi&s;tence of the calamity, did not ex|ceed 15, and it is certain that had our ab&s;ent citizens at|tended to the advice of the Health-Committee, as pub|li&s;hed in the different new&s;papers about this time, di&s;&s;uad|ing them from a premature return, the death warrant of the di&s;order might have been dated from about this day; but it is greatly to be regretted, that numbers of our valuable citizens, by not attending to this admonition, are now tenants of the grave, who, had they only remain|ed till after the fro&s;t, which took place in the latter end of October and beginning of November, might have now, very probably, been in good health. The whole number of funerals for October, was five hundred and twenty two, two hundred and nine of whom were men, one hundred and fifty eight women, and &s;eventy four children. Of the&s;e four hundred and thirty one died of fever. The average of the deaths, during this month, was about 17. On the 10th November, the deaths were only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and on each of the preceding days, they were only 4. The total number during the&s;e 10 days, were 83, of whom 41 were men, twenty two women, and twenty children. Of the&s;e thirty nine died of the fever; the daily average was about 8. The following addre&s;s of the Committee now made its appearance in all the new&s;papers:&mdash;</P>
<P>"The Health-Committee for the relief of the &s;ick and indigent in the city of New-York, beg leave to congratu|late their fellow-citizens, that under Divine Providence, this long afflicted city is once more re&s;tored to its u&s;ual &s;tate of general health, and with the mo&s;t heartfelt plea|&s;ure inform tho&s;e who yet remain in exile, that although a few ca&s;es of the pe&s;tilential fever exi&s;ts, yet that by the late cold weather and fro&s;t, the contagion is &s;o far de&s;troy|ed as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ender the return of their families to the city per|fectly &s;afe, provided they take the nece&s;&s;ary previous mea|&s;ures of clean&s;ing and ventilating their long unaired dwel|lings,
<PB N="14" REF="035586_0013_1005F5F00ABFD4C0">
and purifying the bedding and clothing which may have been left therein during the prevalence of the fever.</P>
<P>It would have afforded the Committee much &s;atisfaction could they have given this invitation at an earlier period, but they did not conceive them&s;elves warranted by the then exi&s;ting circum&s;tances. There have, until the pre&s;ent moment, been &s;everal new ca&s;es of fever, particularly a|mong tho&s;e citizens who returned earlier than the Com|mittee thought prudent; many of whom have fallen vict|ims <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o the devouring pe&s;tilence. This, among other cir|cum&s;tances, has induced the Committee to withhold this invitation until the pre&s;ent time. The Committee beg leave further to inform their fellow-citizens, that from the numerous applications from the indigent for relief, they find it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to continue their labours &s;ome time longer.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the whole number of deaths, during this awful calamity, was two thou&s;and and eighty-&s;ix, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> eleven hundred and ten men, five hundred and eighty-nine women and eight hundred and eighty-five children. Of the&s;e, if we admit that one hundred died of the fever in Augu&s;t, its victims would amount to one thou&s;and five hundred and twenty-four. A great many of our citizens too, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">led, were likewi&s;e cut off by it, hence it is pro|bable, that the &s;um of deaths would be between two thou|&s;and four hundred, and two thou&s;and five hundred: An awful number indeed! Particularly if we con&s;ider that more than one third, &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e that one half of the inhabitants, had le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the city.</P>
<P>An opinion prevailed with many, that the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e varied according to the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere. To this I have paid &s;ome attention; but have not been able to a&s;certain that the opinion is correct. My readers, however, by comparing the table of Meteorological Ob|&s;ervations with that which contains the daily returns of the dead, will be able to &s;atisfy them&s;elves in this particular. But, however doubtful I may be with re&s;pect to the above ob&s;ervations in general, I am certain, that cool mornings and evenings, accompanied by hot days, contributed great|ly to &s;pread the infection; that in ca&s;e of a yellow fever, it is dangerous for tho&s;e who have fled to return to their homes till fro&s;t has &s;et in; and that a keen fro&s;t undoubt|edly

puts an almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous termination to the pro|gre&s;s of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>Having thus given an account of the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and decline of the late fever, I &s;hall next lay before my readers, two communications with which I have been politely favoured, with re&s;pect to its origin &amp;c.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is from <HI>Doctor Samuel L.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>NEW-YORK, <DATE>November 24, 1798.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN your letter of ye&s;terday, you reque&s;t me to furni&s;h you with &s;uch hints as may occur to me concerning the origin of the di&s;temper, which, during the la&s;t three months, has afflicted the city of New-York. I with plea&s;ure com|municate to you on this point, &s;uch general ideas, as in|&s;tant recollection &s;upplies me with. The great di&s;pute which divides the citizens of the United States, whether this di&s;temper is produced at home, or introduced from abroad, appears to me to be more of a &s;peculative than of a practical nature. The experience of the inhabitants of ancient Rome, London, and indeed of mo&s;t large and populous cities in Europe and A&s;ia, have in the progre&s;s of their &s;ettlement, &s;uffered exce&s;&s;ively from mortal epe|demics, Ba&s;sorah has more than once been nearly depo|pulated, and other great cities of the ea&s;tern world, have from time to time, experienced a &s;imilar di&s;a&s;ter. It is &s;ufficiently evident to me that the production and con|tinuance of the&s;e plagues are owing to an imperfect and wretched police; and I judge &s;o becau&s;e in all &s;ituations naturally healthy, where &s;ickne&s;s of that kind has prevailed, it has been in all ca&s;es mitigated, and in many almo&s;t en|tirely prevented, by the adoption of proper local regula|tions. I think the experience of mankind is deci&s;ive on this point.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="035586_0015_1005F5F41F7BF790">
New-York, and &s;ome other cities and towns of North America, are beginning to &s;uffer what other cities and town<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in ancient and modern times have undergone before them. In this country we have as yet lo&s;t only our thou&s;ands, but in Europe and A&s;ia, they have lo&s;t their tens of thou&s;ands, and hundreds of thou&s;ands. A fate as &s;evere as theirs awaits us, if we refu&s;e to profit their experience. It is wi&s;er and better to undertake reformation at once, than by waiting fifty, or an hundred, or five hundred years, with &s;uch decay of indu&s;try and de&s;truction of life, as has been lately our lot, and after all be compelled to execute at la&s;t, that which is both our intere&s;t and our duty to perform without a moments delay.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider cleanline&s;s in our per&s;ons, clothing and habita|tions, to be a matter of moral obligation; and the puni&s;h|ment which providence has wi&s;ely thought proper to in|flict upon tho&s;e who violate this law is &s;ickne&s;s, not un|frequently terminating in yellow-fever, pe&s;tilence and plague.</P>
<P>There is a vulgar &s;aying which I have often heard <HI>"never mind it, one's one na&s;tine&s;s is &s;weet."</HI> It is certain that individuals endure patiently or even with|out adverting to it, more of their <HI>own dirt</HI> than of <HI>other peoples'</HI> Mankind in almo&s;t all places appear to have acted for a long time under the influence of this pernici|ous error; and accordingly when di&s;tempers have broken out in con&s;equence of their own carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and indi&s;cre|tion, they have been fond of laying the blame on others. Hence it has been a&s;&s;erted with the utmo&s;t po&s;itivene&s;s that the yellow-fever has been imported from the We&s;t-Indies, and plague from the Levant, while at the very time the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions are &s;o confidently made by &s;ome among us, the fact of local origin in tho&s;e very places and countries is flatly denied by the people who dwell there. They like our own countrymen "think their own na&s;tine&s;s &s;weet," and cannot be per&s;uaded it has any thing unhealthy or noxious in it.</P>
<P>But let us be candid and examine the &s;ubject fairly: If an army of ten thou&s;and or any other number of men is encamped long in one &s;pot of ground, it often happens that fevers and dy&s;enteries break out among the &s;oldiers; the number of men fit for parade hourly dimini&s;hes, and
<PB N="17" REF="035586_0016_1005F5F7FA6CE0F0">
the Ho&s;pitals are crouded with the &s;ick. There can be no que&s;tion that in &s;uch ca&s;es the cau&s;es of tho&s;e di&s;tem|pers are engendered there. Every prudent general knows the way to &s;top the ravages of the di&s;ea&s;e is to quit the in|fected &s;pot, and encamp upon a new and fre&s;h piece of ground. And this ought always to be attended to in cam|paigns, where the nature of the &s;ervice will permit. In this ca&s;e the men move away and leave the nui&s;ances be|hind.</P>
<P>What now is a modern city but a va&s;t encampment? Are not the &s;ame cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e, daily and hourly accu|mulating? Ought it to be a matter of &s;urprize, that during a moi&s;t and hot &s;ea&s;on venom &s;hould be produced, ri&s;e into the air, and render it too foul and poi&s;onous to &s;up|port life? If it was po&s;&s;ible to abandon the contaminated place, and change our ground, as a general changes his camp, the inhabitants of cities would e&s;cape di&s;ea&s;es as well provided armies do. But &s;eats of commerce, trade and manufacture, are de&s;tined to be the <HI>perpetual</HI> re&s;idence of per&s;ons engaged in certain kinds of bu&s;ine&s;s, who cannot, without irreparable lo&s;s and ruin, quit their improvements and occupations. There is a nece&s;&s;ity, therefore, as they cannot move away from their nui&s;ances, THAT THEIR NUISANCES SHOULD BE MOVED AWAY FROM THEM. Both common &s;en&s;e and common decency de|mand the performance of this.</P>
<P>To be a little more particular: If my information is correct, the exhalations from privies and &s;inks in many parts of this city, have become not only intolerably of|fen&s;ive, but actually pe&s;tilential, and the cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e. The vapours i&s;&s;uing from barrels of putrifying beef have poi&s;oned a number of our citizens. Many &s;tores, yards and cellars abound with &s;ub&s;tances equally detrimental to health; and in addition to this, it de&s;erves to be men|tioned that human carca&s;es, buried and accumulated for a long &s;eries of years, have poi&s;oned the air in many parts of chri&s;tendom, and that by the concurrence of both mu|nicipal and &s;piritual authority, the practice of interring in cities and church-yards, has been ab&s;olutely prohibited in many parts of Italy, on account of the horrid mi&s;chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s occa&s;ioned thereby. Although the evil has not grown to &s;uch an alarming height among our&s;elves at this day,
<PB N="18" REF="035586_0017_1005F5F98DB4F110">
yet it is certainly worthy of con&s;ideration, whether it would not be better at once for chri&s;tians to di&s;card the &s;uper|&s;tition which leads to this practice, and imitate the Jews and Mahometans in conveying their carrion entirely out of town and burying it in places remote from the habita|tions of the living. A regard for the pre&s;ervation of po|&s;terity, as well as our own pre&s;ent and per&s;onal &s;ecurity, impo&s;es on us the adoption of &s;ome deci&s;ive mea&s;ures upon this head.</P>
<P>So much for local origin in and about the habitations of men <HI>on &s;hore.</HI> See next how the que&s;tion &s;tands with re&s;pect to <HI>importation.</HI> It is acknowledged, as has been ob&s;erved, that cities, camps and hou&s;es, may become pe|&s;tilential and un&s;afe to dwell in, by rea&s;on of poi&s;onous matter bred within them. Now, what is a &s;hip but <HI>a hou&s;e a-float?</HI> Every &s;ea-ve&s;&s;el is, properly &s;peaking, a <HI>human habitation.</HI> And in this hou&s;e or habitation are frequently collected all the materials which are known to produce pe&s;tilence on the land. Human beings, too of|ten neglectful of cleanline&s;s during health, and in times of &s;ickne&s;s frequently wallowing in their own filthine&s;s, are the tenants of the&s;e floating hou&s;es; and they are &s;ome|times &s;urrouded by the &s;ickening exhalations emitted from damaged provi&s;ions, hides, coffee, and whatever el&s;e compo&s;es their cargo, rendered active by moi&s;ture, quick|ened by heat, and multiplied by being kept under hatches.</P>
<P>Of all the contrivances of art, a &s;hip &s;eems the mo&s;t completely calculated to concentre &amp; work up to the highe&s;t degree of virulence, all manner of plague-producing things. The hi&s;tory of expeditions both for war and commerce, by &s;ea, furni&s;hes abundant evidence of this truth. Im|portation then &s;tands thus; the &s;ickne&s;s of the crew may be cau&s;ed by pe&s;tilential fluids, and the&s;e fluids are extri|cated from foul and corrupt &s;ub&s;tances <HI>on board the ve&s;&s;el,</HI> and is as much local in its origin THERE as in any place that can be pointed out in this or any other city. Fur|ther, I have it on the information of re&s;pectable ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els, that in numberle&s;s in&s;tances the men fall &s;ick ON BOARD, not only at &s;ea, but in foreign ports and har|bours without ever having been on &s;hore, or having con|nection with any per&s;on or thing that had come from the &s;hore. And what adds to the conclu&s;ivene&s;s of this &s;tate|ment
<PB N="19" REF="035586_0018_1005F5FC2E6C9138">
is, that when the men get &s;ick on board, the cu&s;tom in a number of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, is to &s;end them on &s;hore to recover their health.</P>
<P>If then, by IMPORTATION, is meant the <HI>taking on board the &s;eeds of Yellow-Fever,</HI> and conveying them like grains of coffee or rice (for this is the language) from one region to another, the whole doctrine is indi&s;putably fal|lacious, being grounded on nothing better than a &s;uppo&s;|ed analogy between things exceedingly different in nature from each other, and, on a mi&s;repre&s;entation of facts which has, alas! too generally and too long been countenanced by phy&s;icians and merchants of the highe&s;t character.</P>
<P>My other engagements prevent my adding any more. The contents of this letter are written with my own hand; and if there was any body now with me to whom I might dictate, I could ea&s;ily add a few paragraphs on <HI>pre|vention.</HI> This, however, mu&s;t make a part of a public report on that &s;ubject, in which I am engaged, with &s;eve|ral gentlemen of learning, experience, and re&s;pectability.

</LETTER>
<P>The &s;econd communication I received in a letter from Mr. Richard&s;on Underhill, a re&s;pectable merchant of this city, on the 30th December, in an&s;wer to one which I had written to him, on the 23d of the &s;ame month. This Gentleman is indeed no regular bred phy&s;ician; but as from motives of humanity, he had been very attentive to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the &s;ick, during the calamity of the year 1795, and being a per&s;on of ob&s;ervation, he &s;oon became acquainted with that mode of treatment; which was mo&s;t conducive to their recovery. Upon the commencement of the fever of 1798, being again actuated by the mo&s;t philanthropic principles, he embarked in the &s;ame hazard|ous bu&s;ine&s;s, and was the happy means of mitigating the &s;orrows of many of the afflicted. To the&s;e he not only pre&s;cribed; but al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted in admini&s;tering &s;uch medi|cines
<PB N="20" REF="035586_0019_1005F5FDCE9F7FF0">
as were deemed proper. He likewi&s;e took care, that all tho&s;e whom he &s;aw in want, &s;hould by &s;ome means or other be relieved. A conduct like his, is above eulo|gium. The poor and needy, who&s;e wants were &s;upplied and who&s;e di&s;ea&s;es were cured by his means will no doubt think, as long as they live, of their benefactor with gra|titude.</P>
<P>The communication with which Mr. Underhill, has fa|voured me, appears to me, to be intere&s;ting and as I am convinced it will be con&s;idered in the &s;ame manner by mo&s;t of my readers, I &s;hall lay it before them without fur|ther apology.</P>

<SALUTE>ESTEEMED FRIEND, JAMES HARDIE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THY favor of the 23d. in&s;t. I have the plea&s;ure of ac|knowledging. In this thou a&s;ke&s;t my opinion, re&s;pecting the origin of the di&s;order, to which &s;o many of our citi|zens have recently become victims; the method of cure pur&s;ued by me, and my opinion, what &s;hould be done by the proper authority, to prevent a return of this terrible pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>In a mind, void of prejudice, it is more difficult, per|haps, to form an exact opinion of the origin of this di&s;or|der, than mo&s;t people, upon a tran&s;ient view of the &s;ub|ject, would &s;uppo&s;e; for my own part, neither my educa|tion, nor my inclination, will permit me to form any theo|ries, concerning the fir&s;t engendering of pe&s;tilence, from combinations of gazes, or other cau&s;es. The dens, in which it is bred, and in which it lurks, until it i&s;&s;ues forth to &s;eize its prey, are more proper objects for per&s;ons in my &s;phere of life to enquire out and explore. To this purpo&s;e I have frequently revolved in my mind, whether it was an imported or homebred di&s;order, &s;everal circum|&s;tances concurring to produce an opinion of its being the latter. The rapid progre&s;s of it during one of the hote&s;t &s;ummers we have ever experienced, ju&s;t after a very heavy fall of rain, which &s;tagnated in almo&s;t an innumerable number of cellars and back yards; the malignancy of it
<PB N="21" REF="035586_0020_1005F601ADDDA748">
in the neighbourhood of &s;ome of tho&s;e cellars, many of them &s;towed with large quantities of putrid beef; in the neighbourhood of filthy &s;ewers, or other nui&s;ances, and, al&s;o, from its &s;preading on Golden-hill and Cliff-&s;treet, which are in a northerly direction from &s;ome of tho&s;e dens of pe&s;tilence I have ju&s;t mentioned, and of cour&s;e liable to be acted upon by the prevailing &s;outh winds. But how|ever well founded this opinion may be, with re&s;pect to the agency of tho&s;e things, in producing the di&s;ea&s;e, yet with all the&s;e, other facts, which I will relate, has almo&s;t in|duced me to believe, that all is not to be charged to them. They rendered the neighbourhood highly combu&s;tible, but perhaps a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;park of contagion might be nece&s;&s;ary to pro|duce &s;o dreadful a conflagration. The fir&s;t appearance of the di&s;order was in Front-&s;treet, near Coenties-&s;lip, where Melancton Smith died, about the 28th, or 29th of July, and on the 30th Peter A. Schenk was taken &s;everely &s;ick. The following week, one Wil&s;on, M. Smith. jun. Peter Du&s;tan and wife, and A Adriance, had &s;light attacks, from whence it &s;pread to other families in a very &s;hort time.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The people of this neighbourhood laid the blame of their &s;ickne&s;s to the &s;chooner Fox, which arrived from Jeremie between the middle and latter part of July, and hawled to a wharf a little ca&s;t of Coenties-&s;lip, where &s;he unloaded, and upon pumping her out, her bilge-water was very offen&s;ive; but I think the filth to be ob&s;erved in this part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">own, quite as likely to give them fever as bilge-water and mola&s;&s;es.</NOTE></P>
<P>The next appearance of the fever was at the hou&s;e of Henry Mead, at the lower corner on the we&s;t &s;ide of the New-&s;lip. Some time in July, the &s;hip Fame, &s;aid to have arrived from &s;ome one of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, came to the wharf next below the New-&s;lip, and lay there &s;ome time. About the 3d or 4th of Augu&s;t, &s;ome people went to di&s;charging the balla&s;t and pumping her out; a|mong the balla&s;t was a quantity of damaged coffee, ex|tremely putrid, which, with the water di&s;charged from the pump, was &s;o offen&s;ive to the &s;mell, that the neighbours were induced to &s;hut their windows, e&s;pecially while eat|ing. About the 6th of &s;aid month, the following per&s;ons &s;pent a con&s;iderable part of the day at Mead's hou&s;e, John Taylor, Ebenezer Taylor, Sylvanus Seaman, Monmouth Hubbs, Walter Davis, Augu&s;tus Peck, and a young man, clerk in a &s;tore near the exchange: Mo&s;t of the&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="035586_0021_1005F603F501DEB8">
dined there, and during their dinner, they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hutting up their doors and windows, though the weather was very warm, &s;o exceedingly were they an|noyed by the &s;tench from the &s;hip. Of this company, collected from &s;everal quarters, and who di&s;per&s;ed to their re&s;pective homes, not a &s;ingle one e&s;caped &s;evere &s;ick|ne&s;s, which they were taken with in from 4 to 5 days, and of which John and Ebenezer Taylor died. Two per&s;ons belonging to the family were al&s;o &s;ick. The next hou&s;e above this, (there being none below it) was at the &s;ame time vi&s;ited, and of 5 per&s;ons, three were taken danger|ou&s;ly ill and 2 died: In the &s;econd hou&s;e above, 3 more per&s;ons were &s;ick at the &s;ame time, and 1 died; and the family of the hou&s;e next to this, &s;hared a &s;imilar fate, 3 were &s;ick, two of whom died in a very &s;hort time. Many of the boatmen, who&s;e ve&s;&s;els lay in the &s;lip at this period, fared no better, a number of them being victims to this &s;tench, or the contagion it produced. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;lip, the inhabitants at this time were as healthy as u&s;ual for the &s;ea&s;on; but in the neighbourhood northerly, the di&s;order &s;pread with great rapidity; &s;carcely a family e&s;caped &s;evere &s;ickne&s;s for &s;ome di&s;tance in that direction: it is to be ob&s;erved that the wind was wholly &s;outherly.&mdash;Nathaniel Clark, who lives in Cherry-&s;treet, in this neigh|bourhood, was on the wharf where this &s;hip lay, and went home to his family, complained much of the &s;tench he had &s;melt there, and in 3 or 4 days was taken with the fever, which he had &s;everely: Several of his family &s;icken|ed &s;hortly after. From the&s;e facts it appears that the &s;ick|ne&s;s in this quarter was cau&s;ed by the &s;hip; whether it was created in her, or brought from another country, I cannot undertake to determine; but be it as it may, the fever was undoubtedly there contagious; and &s;pread to di&s;tant parts of the town by means of the &s;ick; the bodies of the inha|bitants having (as I &s;uppo&s;e) been rendered ripe for its re|ception. From here I can trace it to the neighbourhood of Golden-hill, where a man named Harper, died in Gold-&s;treet on the 11th of Augu&s;t. One Fowler died the 18th of &s;ame month in John-&s;treet; and the 3d victim was So|lomon Carl, who died on the 20th, in Gold-&s;treet. Har|per imputed the origin of his &s;ickne&s;s to his having cro&s;&s;ed the deck of the &s;hip beforementioned three days before he
<PB N="23" REF="035586_0022_1005EBE1A981DEA8">
was taken; a re&s;pectable merchant was with him, who has &s;ince told me they were offended with a very di&s;agreeable &s;mell. Solomon Carl was at the funeral of a woman na|med Jones, who had died in the neighbourhood of the New-Slip, about 3 days before he &s;ickened him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The methods I pur&s;ued to cure the di&s;order were gene|rally very &s;imple, &s;uch as were dictated by nature, and a &s;mall &s;hare of experience I had in the year 1795. I en|deavoured always to purge the patient, bring on a gentle per&s;piration and continue it, which treatment of it&s;elf I may &s;ay cured hundreds; the medicines I &s;elected to bring about tho&s;e ends, were &s;uch as I deemed milde&s;t and mo&s;t efficacious in their operation: for the fir&s;t purpo&s;e I u&s;ed ca&s;tor oil, and for the other, warm teas of cat-nip or balm; In ob&s;tinate ca&s;es, or ca&s;es attended with delirium, I u&s;ed hot applications of a&s;hes, bricks, &amp;c. wet with vi|negar and &s;pirits, and if I could rai&s;e a per&s;piration a cure generally en&s;ued, particularly among middle aged per&s;ons of good con&s;titutions. Tho&s;e were the methods mo&s;t u&s;ed, tho' I found it nece&s;&s;ary to var<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and u&s;e other means at times, according to the con&s;titution of the patient, or &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, when I fir&s;t began my pre&s;criptions.</P>
<P>My opinion concerning what is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent a return of this di&s;order is formed from the facts I have before related. I think it nece&s;&s;ary to ab&s;olutely prohibit &s;tagn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> waters and to compel tho&s;e per&s;ons who have wet cellars, to keep them con&s;tantly pumped out and cleaned; to fill up the docks and &s;lips, if not entirely, at lea&s;t &s;uch parts of them as are too far from running water, or are expo&s;ed to the &s;un at low-water; to prevent provi&s;ions from being &s;tored at all in town, during certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year.

<P>"About the beginning of Augu&s;t, in con&s;equence of the foul, unfini&s;hed &s;tate of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">everal water-lots, on the Ea&s;t river, between Coenties and the Old-&s;lip, upwards of 20 per&s;ons were attacked nearly about the &s;ame time, with what appeared to be <HI>common colds,</HI> &s;ome &s;lightly, others more &s;everely; but the general occurrence of the fact in that neighdourhood, led to a belief that it aro&s;e from a <HI>local</HI> cau&s;e, and threatened &s;omething more &s;erious.

<P>In the neighbourhood of the New-&s;lip, where the build|ings for the mo&s;t part are &s;mall, and many of them inhabi|ted by poor people, who live in a crouded manner, and in &s;ituations incapable of proper ventilation, di&s;ea&s;es oc|curred about the 12th&mdash;a number of per&s;ons died&mdash;but at pre&s;ent there appears to be no great cau&s;e of alarm in that quarter.</P>
<P>"About the &s;ame period, or a little later, two or three per&s;ons were &s;eized at Bruce's wharf, with &s;u&s;picious &s;ymptoms, and &s;ome deaths have taken place there and in its vicinity, owing, it is generally thought, to the ex|tremely foul condition of Bruce and Mar&s;ton's unfilled lots, bounding on the Ea&s;t-river, at the foot of Pine-&s;treet the effluvia i&s;&s;uing from them being highly putrid and of|fen&s;ive.

"About the 20th, &s;everal per&s;ons were &s;eized in Cliff-&s;treet, nearly in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e between Coen|ties-&s;lip and the Old-&s;lip.

The&s;e complaints, on inve&s;tigation, were thought to pro|ceed, in part, from the offen&s;ive &s;tate of that &s;ewer; which had, for &s;ome time, become a receptacle for vari|ous &s;pecies of putrid matter, and of which the mouth lies nearly oppo&s;ite John-&s;treet, commonly called Golden-hill &s;treet&mdash;&s;o that whenever a South or S.

The be&s;t informed phy&s;icians are of this opinion. The head of the &s;ewer has &s;ince been clo&s;ed by a valve-door, and a con&s;iderable quantity of quick-lime thrown into it, with a view of neutralizing its contents. A &s;imilar door, with the &s;ame intention, has been added to the Ferry-&s;treet &s;ewer.</P>
<P>"Other cau&s;es are al&s;o alledged, and with great plau|&s;ibility, at lea&s;t, if not certainty.</P>
<P>"It is well known that the ce&s;&s;ation of our commer|cial intercour&s;e with the French i&s;lands, in con&s;equence of their ho&s;tile violence, has greatly le&s;&s;ened the demand for provi&s;ions; of cour&s;e large quantities of bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> remain|ed in many cellars, particularly among the merchants of Pearl-&s;treet.

<P>"Individual ca&s;es have al&s;o occurred in other parts of the town, but, as in 1795, they remain in&s;ulated, and without communication to the attendants, as far as we can di&s;cover. The&s;e, it is generally thought, were taken at one or the other places before mentioned.</P>
<P>"An opinion has been avowed by &s;ome, that the di&s;|ea&s;e has been imported, or aro&s;e from damaged coffee, thrown out of a &s;hip on Kelly's dock, we&s;t of the New-&s;lip.

<P>"We are informed by a gentleman who has been at the pains to collect a li&s;t of the per&s;ons interred in the &s;everal burial grounds, that during the la&s;t week they averaged about 12 per day&mdash;and that previous to Sunday la&s;t, there was no very unu&s;ual mortality for the &s;ea&s;on.</P>

To the&s;e opinions I &s;hall add another, which my readers, will no doubt, con&s;ider as being very re&s;pectable; I mean that of our Health-Officer, Doctor Bayley. I have extracted what follows from a late very intere&s;t|ing publication of his, entitled, <HI>"Letters from the Health Office to the Common Council."</HI></P>

<HEAD>To the Common Council of the City of New-York.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>HEALTH-OFFICE, <DATE>December 4, 1798.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN addition to the facts which are contained in the cor|re&s;pondence between the Health Commi&s;&s;ioners and the Common Council for the year 1798, I &s;hall offer to your con&s;ideration a few remarks upon the origin and progre&s;s of the pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e which has lately prevailed in this city; and in order to corroborate what I may advance, I &s;hall, in the fir&s;t place take a retro&s;pect of events which have annually taken place in this city, during the warm months &s;ince the year 1795.</P>
<P>According to the records of the Health-Office, the yel|low fever appeared in 1796 at White-hall, at the foot of Pine-&s;treet, at Burling-&s;lip, and in the neighbourhood of Roo&s;evelt-&s;treet &s;ewer.</P>
<P>In 1797 between Coenties and the Old-&s;lip, in Front-&s;treet, at the Fly-market in &s;everal in&s;tances, in Fletcher-&s;treet, at Burling-&s;lip, in Water-&s;treet, adjoining Roo&s;e|velt-&s;treet &s;ewer, in George-&s;treet, and at the foot of Pine-&s;treet.</P>
<P>In 1798 the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared about midway be|tween Coenties and the Old-&s;lip, in Front-&s;treet, be|tween the 1&s;t and 7th of Augu&s;t. On the 7th of Augu&s;t about twenty-three were reported &s;ick to the Health-Of|fice. From that period &s;everal others &s;ickened, and of the whole number one died. By the 26th of Augu&s;t, the com|plaint had di&s;appeared in that quarter in con&s;equence of the mea&s;ures taken to remove the cau&s;e, by covering the offen&s;ive lots with clean, whole&s;ome earth.</P>
<P>On the 12th of Augu&s;t, it appeared at No. 283, Water-&s;treet, in the ca&s;e of Mr. Taylor, in an old broken build|ing,
<PB N="29" REF="035586_0028_1005F61382A2D1E8">
on an unfini&s;hed lot at the foot of Dover-&s;treet, in which 11 per&s;ons died early in 1795, and which has &s;ince been repeatedly repre&s;ented as a nui&s;ance.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 12, al&s;o, the di&s;ea&s;e appeared in the ca&s;e of John Hender&s;on, corner of James-&s;treet, and Batavia-lane. On all &s;ides of his re&s;idence, which was a &s;mall crowded build|ing, there were &s;unken lots in an unfini&s;hed &s;tate.</P>
<P>Again, on Augu&s;t 12, the di&s;ea&s;e appeared in William Whitlock, Card-maker, No. 51, Cherry-&s;treet. In the rear and to the &s;outh of his re&s;idence, the lots are very ge|nerally below the level of the &s;treets, and without drains.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t arrival of &s;ick in this harbour, (to the know|ledge of the Health-Office) from Philadelphia, was on the 13th of Augu&s;t, in the New-York and Philadelphia Packet. The Captain died on the pa&s;&s;age&mdash;the mate was &s;ick and was &s;ent to Bellevue.</P>

On the morning of the 14th, the heavie&s;t rain fell of any time during the year. It began at 5 A. M. and continued without intermi&s;&s;ion till nine.

<P>The &s;udden and great increa&s;e of heat immediately after the violent rain, appeared to have a proportionately in|fluence in producing fever. Between that period and the 22d Augu&s;t, upwards of twenty per&s;ons in Cliff-&s;treet, were &s;eized with &s;light indi&s;po&s;itions, which they attributed to &s;leeping with open windows during the preceding hot and moi&s;t weather, but which appeared rather as the fore|runner of yellow fever, for, not only the per&s;ons thus in|di&s;po&s;ed, but a number of others in the &s;ame &s;treet, had that di&s;ea&s;e in the cour&s;e of a few days.</P>
<P>From this period the di&s;ea&s;e became more general; but its fatality was principally felt in Cliff-&s;treet and its neigh|bourhood, at Catherine &s;lip, in Water-&s;treet and on the unfini&s;hed grounds in the &s;outhern part of the city.</P>
<P>Now having &s;een that the yellow fever had made its ap|pearance in New-York every year, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, but has prevailed in very different degrees, it becomes a matter of great importance to determine, why the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;o generally prevalent on the low new-made grounds in 1795, whil&s;t it was &s;carcely felt in the more elevated &s;ituations; why, in 1796, and 1797, its appearance was limited to particular &s;pots; and why, in 1798 it not only prevailed
<PB N="31" REF="035586_0030_1005F618D7C62E80">
on all the new-made grounds, but al&s;o in parts of the city which had before been exempted from the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions in &s;uch a manner, as to prove &s;atisfactory to every one, might be a very difficult ta&s;k. I &s;hall, however, offer &s;ome rea&s;ons which may tend to &s;hew why the fever was more prevalent this year, than in the preceding years.</P>
<P>It is well a&s;certained that in the year 1795, there was an unu&s;ual degree of heat and moi&s;ture in the atmo&s;phere during the warmer months&mdash;that the Thermometer was con&s;iderably higher than in 1796 and 1797, but that in 1798, the heat greatly exceeded that of 1795.</P>
<P>Now, as heat and moi&s;ture are powerful agents in pro|ducing pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, &s;o mu&s;t the &s;ame cau&s;es nece&s;|&s;arily promote the exten&s;ion of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>In the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">98, there were be&s;ides, local cau&s;es of fever in this city, which did not exi&s;t in the other &s;ea&s;ons, and which, co-operating with the weather, &s;erved to extend the di&s;ea&s;e beyond the limits, to which it would probably have been otherwi&s;e confined. I have reference to the immen&s;e quantities of &s;poiled beef, fi&s;h, and other articles of a peri&s;hable nature, which were &s;tored in different parts of this city. The noxious exhalations ari&s;ing from the&s;e &s;ources, in my apprehen&s;ion, was a great cau&s;e why the di&s;ea&s;e aro&s;e and raged with great violence in particular &s;ituations: And when we con&s;ider the &s;udden appearance of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ever at Golden-hill and in Cliff-&s;treet, and the great number which &s;ickened nearly at the &s;ame time, there is great rea&s;on to believe this opinion well founded.</P>
<P>About the 20th of Augu&s;t, a report was made to the Health Office, that great quantities of &s;poiled beef were &s;tored in Pearl-&s;treet, between Burling and Beekman-&s;lips. The &s;tench which i&s;&s;ued from &s;ome of the cellars in this &s;ituation, was &s;o con&s;iderable, as to prove very offen&s;ive to tho&s;e who pa&s;&s;ed by, and became a &s;ubject of general ob|&s;ervation. Letters, in con&s;equence, from the Health-Office, were addre&s;&s;ed to owners of provi&s;ions in that quarter, en|joining them to have the beef examined, and to have &s;uch as was &s;poiled, &s;ent out of the city. In&s;tead, however, of adopting this plan, the beef was brought from the cellars into the &s;treet, the barrels opened, and the putrid pickle

thrown into the gutters. In &s;ome in&s;tances the examina|tion was made in the cellars, and the pickle di&s;po&s;ed of in the &s;ame manner. The gutters which conveyed away this putrid pickle, led to Burling-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lip &s;ewer.</P>
<P>The relative &s;ituation of this &s;ewer, and Cliff-&s;treet is &s;uch that the &s;outherly and &s;outh-ea&s;terly winds, force a current of air through the &s;ewer, carrying with it the exhala|tions ari&s;ing from the noxious matter collected together in that place, and having a direction to pa&s;s more immediate|ly up Golden-hill, and into Cliff-&s;treet; and every per&s;on in that neighbourhood with whom I have conver&s;ed, agrees as to the offen&s;ive &s;mell of the air, previous to the appear|ance of the fever.</P>
<P>On the 20th of Augu&s;t, the wind, which had been blow|ing from the north and we&s;t &s;ome days previous, &s;hifted to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and continued to blow from that quarter &s;ome time. In 48 hours after this, there was &s;carcely a hou&s;e in Pearl-&s;treet, near where the &s;poiled provi&s;ions were &s;tored, in the lower end of John-&s;treet, and in Cliff-&s;treet, which did not contain &s;ick.</P>
<P>The &s;udden appearance of fever in this part of the city, and the great number which were in &s;o &s;hort a time affec|ted, proves the local nature of the cau&s;e; and to the one which I have ju&s;t mentioned, I have no he&s;itation, in a&s;cribing all the effects which were experienced.</P>
<P>If what we have alledged, be admitted &s;ufficient to ex|plain the appearance of fever which took place in Cliff-&s;treet, &amp;c. we have made &s;ome advances towards account|ing for the general prevalence of the di&s;ea&s;e in 1798.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">de the H. Office corre&s;pondenc on the &s;ubject of &s;poiled provi&s;ions.</NOTE></P>
<P>But, gentlemen, we have further to remark a particu|lar difference in the warm &s;ea&s;ons of 1798 and 1795.</P>
<P>In 1795 the weather was warm and moi&s;t, but there was but very little rain.</P>
<P>In 1798 the weather was not only much warmer, but was accompanied by &s;udden and heavy rains.</P>
<P>Immediately after the rains the public papers teemed with addre&s;&s;es to the citizens, entreating them to empty their cellars of the water which had collected in them, or the mo&s;t fatal effects would be felt from neglect, or inat|tention to this circum&s;tance. It is not my intention to di&s;pute the opinion advanced by the&s;e writers. But, if
<PB N="33" REF="035586_0032_1005F61D8DF4D870">
the production of di&s;ea&s;e, was to be apprehended from the lodgment of water in places where the &s;un's rays never en|ter, what effects were to be expected from the ponding of water in tho&s;e numerous lots and yards within this city, which are &s;everal feet below the level of the &s;treets, con|taining dead animal and vegetable matters, and to which the rays of the &s;un have full acce&s;s? I wi&s;h you, gentle|men, to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly upon this compari&s;on, and be|lieve, that whil&s;t tho&s;e &s;unken, undrained lots are &s;uffer|ed to remain in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, unle&s;s cau&s;es cea&s;e to produce their effects, di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t inevitably re&s;ult.</P>
<P>On examining the records of the legi&s;lature of this &s;tate, it will be found, that petitions have been preferred to that body, for permi&s;&s;ion to erect mill-dams on certain &s;treams of water in &s;ome of the northern counties, and the prayer of the petitioners has been granted. The con&s;equence was, that con&s;iderable tracts of low grounds in the neigh-hood of the mill-dams, were overflowed in the &s;pring, and after the water had pa&s;&s;ed off, and the &s;urface of tho&s;e grounds were expo&s;ed to the influence of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">un, exhala|tions of &s;o baneful a nature aro&s;e, as to produce a fever of a bilious type, which attacked almo&s;t every body with|in a certain di&s;tance from their &s;ource, and proved very mortal in its effects. The cau&s;e of this &s;ickne&s;s being &s;o obvious, petitions were pre&s;ented to the legi&s;lature, pray|ing for a redre&s;s of the grievances. To correct the evil, it of cour&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy the mill-dams, and as &s;oon as the waters were unob&s;tructed, and allowed to flow in their u&s;ual channel, the country became as healthy as before.</P>
<P>Permit me, gentlemen, to a&s;k the following que&s;tions: If the re&s;ult of exhalations ari&s;ing from grounds which have been covered with water in an open country, has been the production of bilious remitting fevers, attended with con&s;iderable mortality, what re&s;ult ought we to ex|pect from tho&s;e exhalations which ari&s;e from the ponding of water on 150 acres of low grounds and &s;unken yards and lots in a crouded city, and of a &s;outhern a&s;pect?</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I &s;hall take the liberty of noticing &s;ome of the public mea&s;ures that have been adopted for the removal of cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e in this city. I &s;hall con|fine my&s;elf to two principal objects:</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="035586_0033_1005F61FD6291C68">
<HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> The want of a &s;ufficient de&s;cent on the low grounds along the ea&s;t-river, to carry off the waters from the &s;treets, is generally admitted. A con&s;iderable quan|tity of water mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;tagnate in the gutters of the&s;e &s;treets, and al&s;o in the &s;unken pavement. In dry weather this lodgement con&s;i&s;ts principally of water which has been u&s;ed for culinary and other family purpo&s;es, and mu&s;t therefore, be &s;uppo&s;ed to abound with matters to afford noxious exhalations.</P>
<P>By an ordinance of the Corporation for cleaning the &s;treets, the inhabitants are directed to &s;crape out the dirt and filth collected in the gutters, and heap them up in the &s;treets, to be removed by the &s;cavengers <HI>in the cour&s;e of the day.</HI></P>
<P>Now, does this regulation in any degree &s;ub&s;erve the purpo&s;es for which it was ordained? Does not the &s;pread|ing of this dirt and filth, and expo&s;ing new and greater &s;urfaces, increa&s;e the mi&s;chief which the mea&s;ure was in|tended to correct? I believe, gentlemen, there will be found no other means to rid the low grounds of this city, from the baneful effects of &s;tagnant waters, and an accu|mulation of noxious matters, than their being freely wa&s;h|ed by currents of water flowing over them.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> In the &s;ame ordinance, the citizens are pro|hibited from throwing into the &s;treets, from their re&s;pect|ive hou&s;es, cellars, or yards, any dirt, filth, or o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">als whatever, except on certain days. How will this be found to operate in <HI>removing</HI> the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e? Should we not rather a&s;k, how this will be found to operate in <HI>in|crea&s;ing</HI> the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e? One moment's reflection, I pre&s;ume, will convince us that &s;ome means ought to be adopted to remedy a &s;y&s;tem &s;o fraught with mi&s;chief, and for the&s;e means I take the liberty of referring you to letter 70, addre&s;&s;ed by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Health Office to the Common Council.</P>

From the preceding &s;tatements, it will appear to my readers, that the cau&s;e of the origin of this di&s;order, is &s;till a matter of que&s;tion among&s;t the learned; and that it is not as yet fully decided, whether the calamity, with which the cities of the United States have within the&s;e few years been repeatedly afflicted, has been imported, or that it is engendered in our own country. Several rea&s;ons, how|ever, induce me to incline to the latter opinion.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> We are &s;ituated in the &s;ame latitude with tho&s;e places of the old world, where pe&s;tilential di&s;orders annu|ally predominate. With tho&s;e places we are alike expo&s;|ed during the &s;ummer months to the united effects of heat and moi&s;ture, and from &s;imilar cau&s;es &s;imilar effects may be always expected.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The fever with which we were lately afflict|ed, although its fir&s;t appearance was at one particular &s;pot, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ties-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lip, yet it was &s;oon afterwards &s;een in &s;o many different parts of the city, and &s;o far remote from one another, that it is by no means probable that the con|tagion could be communicated &s;o &s;peedily. Indeed, if the contagion was imported it would &s;eem to me, that there mu&s;t have been at lea&s;t &s;even or eight different &s;our|ces of infection, or it could not have appeared in every di|rection from the &s;hip-yards to the battery, almo&s;t about the &s;ame time.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> As a proof that this fever may be engendered in our climate, it may be added that it had at different times made its appearance in the vicinity of low mar&s;hy grounds both in this and the neighbouring &s;tates <HI>(See Web&s;ter's Collection of Papers on the &s;ubject of Bilious Fevers preva|lent in the United States for a few years pa&s;t)</HI> and that it appeared in the &s;tate of New-Jer&s;ey during the la&s;t autumn, is pretty evident from the two following extracts of letters from two eminent phy&s;icians in that &s;tate.</P>

<P>"From many facts I am induced to believe (tho' very reluctantly) that there were ca&s;es of the yellow-fever in this place during the la&s;t autumn, which originated on the &s;pot, and that its propagation was occa&s;ioned, or at lea&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="035586_0035_1005F6241BF74D40">
promoted, by local infection, or generated in the place of its origination."</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Extract of a letter from Dr. Lummis, of Woodbury, dated Dec. 4 to a Phy&s;ician in Philadelphia.</HEAD>
<P>"During the late autumn, in the months of September and October, I vi&s;ited &s;everal per&s;ons affected with the bilious yellow-fever, who had no po&s;&s;ible opportunity of deriving their di&s;ea&s;e from any foreign &s;ource. Knowing that this di&s;ea&s;e might have been of dome&s;tic origin, and probably introduced among them from the city of Phila|delphia, I was exceedingly particular in my enquiries on this point, and being &s;atisfied from the te&s;timony of the per&s;ons attacked, and of the families in which they re&s;ided, of their not having any communication with the city of Philadelphia for a long time previous to their &s;uffering with the di&s;ea&s;e; and of their having avoided, in the mo&s;t careful manner, all intercour&s;e with families affected with the yellow-fever in their own neighbourhood, I have no he&s;itation in believing their di&s;ea&s;e to have been the offs|pring of local cau&s;es. The Majority of the&s;e ca&s;es have occurred in families living on farms &s;ituated on the Jer&s;ey &s;hore of the Delaware. The mo&s;t valuable part of the&s;e farms con&s;i&s;t of meadow; the proximity of the&s;e &s;ituations to the Delaware, and large tracts of meadow land lead me to a&s;cribe their di&s;ea&s;e (aided by a peculiar &s;tate of the air) to the exhalations or mar&s;h effluvia, ari&s;ing from the low grounds &s;ituated near the banks, and the meadows in the vicinity of the Delaware. The peculiar di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e exhalations to produce di&s;ea&s;e and death, was evinced early in the &s;ea&s;on by the mortality which pre|vailed among the fowls and cats in this neighbourhood. I am not alone in having &s;een ca&s;es of yellow-fever which cannot be traced to contagion. Similar facts have been witne&s;&s;ed this &s;ea&s;on by other Phy&s;icians, in various parts of New-Jer&s;ey."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved that our climate being the &s;ame with tho&s;e places in the old world, which are annually ex|po&s;ed to pe&s;tilential di&s;orders, we cannot expect to be en|tirely exempt from them. But at the &s;ame time I am fully per&s;uaded, that if we make u&s;e of tho&s;e means, which Divine Providence has put in our power, we have little to apprehend, on the &s;core of their return or &s;pread|ing

in this country. In Turkey where pe&s;tilential di&s;or|ders are exceedingly prevalent, &s;uch is the indolence of the inhabitants that little or no attempts are made to pre|vent their return or to &s;top their ravages: for to u&s;e the words of Mr. John Payne, in his excellent &s;y&s;tem of Ge|ography, now publi&s;hing in this city, by John Low, Book&s;eller, at the Shake&s;peare's Head, No. 332 Water &s;treet, "The doctrine of prede&s;tination and &s;till more the barbari&s;m of the government have hitherto prevented the Turks from attempting to guard again&s;t this de&s;tructive di&s;order, (meaning the plague) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ucce&s;s however, of the precautions taken by the Franks, has of late began to make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ions upon many of them. The Chri&s;tians of the country, who trade with European na|tions, would be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hut them&s;elves up like them; but this they cannot do without the authority of the Porte. It &s;eems indeed, as if the Divan would at la&s;t pay &s;ome attention to this object, if it be true that an edict was i&s;&s;ued in 1783, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Lazaretto as Con&s;tantinople and three others at Smyrna, Candia, and Alexandria. The government of Tunis adopted this wi&s;e mea&s;ure &s;ome years ago; but the Turki&s;h police is every where &s;o wretched, that little &s;ucce&s;s can be hoped from the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments notwith&s;tanding their extreme impor|tance and the &s;afety of the Mediterranean &s;tates."</P>
<P>The above is the &s;tate of pe&s;tilential di&s;orders among&s;t them; but &s;urely with us it is widely different. Many of our citizens, indeed, believe in the doctrine of prede&s;ti|nation as well as the Turks; but at the &s;ame time, almo&s;t every individual in ca&s;e of any calamity, thinks it his du|ty to make u&s;e of tho&s;e means which Providence has put in his power, to avert it. Our police is likewi&s;e, by no means, wretched. Our magi&s;trates, to whom the health of our citizens is confided, are men of intelligence, and when the &s;ources from which pe&s;tilence ari&s;e in our cities is better under&s;tood, which from the mea&s;ures lately taken, we may &s;oon expect, there is little doubt, that our cities &s;hall in a &s;hort time be either wholly exempt from, or at lea&s;t partially vi&s;ited by the direful calamity of the yellow-fever.</P>
<P>To prevent its return has not only been an object of de&s;irous enquiry with the magi&s;trates of different cities,

But when we reflect, that this fatal di&s;order has, within a few years made repeated rava|ges in &s;ome of our principal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ports, and with increa&s;ed malignancy, and when we con&s;ider the magnitude of the evils ari&s;ing from the interruption of public and private bu&s;ine&s;s, whereby the national intere&s;ts are deeply affected; I think it my duty to invite the legi&s;lature of the union to examine the expediency of e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uitable regulati|ons in aid of the health laws of the re&s;pective &s;tates; for the&s;e being formed on the idea that contagious &s;ickne&s;s may be communicated throughout the channels of com|merce, there &s;eems to be a nece&s;&s;ity, that Congre&s;s who alone can regulate trade, &s;hould frame a &s;y&s;tem which, while it may tend to pre&s;erve the general health, may be compatible with the intere&s;ts of commerce, and the &s;afety of the revenue."</P>

con&s;equence the &s;ociety appointed a committee of their own body, con&s;i&s;ting of Doctors Samuel L. Mitchell, James Tillary, and John B.

<P>The &s;ituation of our fellow citizens in Philadelphia, was not very different from tho&s;e of New-York.

<HEAD>On the Origin and Means of preventing the return of the Yellow Fever.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN order to comply with your reque&s;t to the academy of medicine, communicated by Dr. Samuel Duffield, the con&s;ulting phy&s;ician of the port, re&s;pecting the means, of preventing the return of the epidemic fever which has lately afflicted our city, the academy have conceived the hi&s;tory of its origin nece&s;&s;arily connected with their an&s;wer.</P>
<P>We believe it was derived from the following &s;ources:</P>
<P N="1">1. The exhalations of the alleys, gutters, docks, and common &s;ewers of the city; and from &s;tagnating water in its neighborhood.</P>
<P N="2">2. The foul air di&s;charged with the balla&s;t of the &s;hip Deborah, and the cargo of the brig Mary: the former of which arrived from Hi&s;paniola on the 18th of July, and the latter on the 29th of the &s;ame month. We reject the opinion of an imported human contagion in either of the above ve&s;&s;els. It has not been a&s;&s;erted that any per&s;on died of the yellow fever on board the Mary, during her voyage; and if it be &s;aid, that &s;everal per&s;ons died on
<PB N="40" REF="035586_0039_1005F62E9379D700">
board the Deborah of that di&s;ea&s;e, on her pa&s;&s;age to this city, we cannot admit that they contaminated the timbers or contents of the &s;hip in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;pread the di&s;ea&s;e to per&s;ons at &s;everal hundred feet di&s;tance from the wharf at which &s;he was moored. The improbability of this opinion will appear from two con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t&mdash;The di&s;ea&s;e is not contagious in the We&s;t Indies; and rarely, if ever &s;o, in the United States in hot weather, at which time only it makes its fir&s;t appearance in our country. So general is this opinion, that &s;ome phy&s;icians have unfortunately refu&s;ed to admit the exi&s;tence of the fever in its commencement in our city, only becau&s;e it was not contagious.</P>
<P>Second&mdash;The di&s;ea&s;e was in no in&s;tance propagated by tho&s;e per&s;ons who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have derived it from human contagion, adhering to the timbers and contents of the Deborah and Mary, and who died with it in parts of the city remote from the influence of the foul air of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that the contagion of the yellow fever is not uniform in its effects, it ought, at lea&s;t, to be admitted, that it acts with mo&s;t certainty where it exi&s;ts with mo&s;t force; but a rever&s;e of this took place in the &s;uppo&s;ed origin of our late fever, from imported contagion. We are the more determined in our opinion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oul air of the Deborah and Mary being the cau&s;e of many ca&s;es of our fever, from &s;imilar ca&s;es of fever having been often produced from &s;imilar cau&s;es, in&s;tances of which were mentioned in our letter to you la&s;t year.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of our opinion of the di&s;ea&s;e being deprived from the exhalations of our city before enumerated, we &s;hall mention the names of the following per&s;ons, who had the fever before the arrival of the Deborah or Mary in our port, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Benjamin Jones, from Berger's court, June 2d Mary Wriggle&s;worth, near the corner of Walnut and Tenth &s;treets, June 6th; Rebecca Tre&s;ted, in Front be|tween Spruce and Union &s;treets, June 11th; Eliza Curran, Fourth below South &s;treet, 27th June; Mark Miller, Callowhill &s;treet, and Molly Zeller, Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;treet, July 2d; Mi&s;s Byrne, Spruce, between Second and Third &s;treets, July 11th; Mr. Vanno&s;t, Shannon &s;treet wharves, July 12th.

<P>In addition to the arguments in favour of the dome&s;tic &s;ources of the fever that have been mentioned in our for|mer letter, we &s;hall add four more that we think cannot be refuted.</P>
<P N="1">1. The atmo&s;phere of our city, during the prevalence of the fever, produced &s;en&s;ations of pain or &s;ickne&s;s in ma|ny people who came into it from the country; the &s;ame atmo&s;phere became the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e and death in others who vi&s;ited the city, and who carefully avoided lodging, or any intercour&s;e with per&s;ons infected by the fever.</P>
<P N="2">2. The di&s;ea&s;e prevailed in many inland towns of the United States, which had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> intercour&s;e with &s;ea-port towns in which it was epidemic. Tho&s;e towns were, in every in&s;tance we have heard of, &s;ituated near to putrid &s;ub&s;tances, or &s;tagnating water.</P>
<P N="3">3. The di&s;ea&s;e was rarely contagious, even when it ter|minated in death, when carried into the country, or into towns not expo&s;ed to putrid exhalations.</P>
<P N="4">4. The general extinction of the di&s;ea&s;e by fro&s;t&punc; clear|ly proves that it exi&s;ts chiefly in the atmo&s;phere; and that it is not derived, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, from human conta|gion; for fro&s;t, it is well known, does not act in the au|tumnal months upon the bodies of the &s;ick, nor upon their beds, cloathing, or any other &s;uppo&s;ed receptacle of contagion.</P>
<P>We wi&s;h to direct the attention of our fellow citizens to the hi&s;tory of the cau&s;es and remedies of pe&s;tilential di&s;|ea&s;es in foreign countries: In the ages of medical &s;uper|&s;tition, when tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es were believed to be imported, they nearly depopulated cities for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years. Frequent and accumulated &s;uffering at la&s;t begat wi&s;dom. The cau&s;es of pe&s;tilence were di&s;covered to exi&s;t in all countries, and dome&s;tic remedies were applied to remove them. The effect of this change in the opinion and con|duct of the nations of Europe, has been the almo&s;t gene|ral
<PB N="42" REF="035586_0041_1005F6331E838218">
extirpation of malignant fevers from their cities and &s;ea-ports. We have many documents to prove that the recurrence of the yellow fever has been prevented in the cities of Europe by cleanline&s;s. It formerly prevailed in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Holland, and occa&s;ion|ally, in Britain and Ireland, under the names of putrid, malignant, and bilious fevers, al&s;o of the <HI>gall-&s;ickne&s;s</HI> and of the <HI>black-fever.</HI> The la&s;t name was derived from the black vomiting, which is &s;o often the &s;ymptom of ap|proaching death in billious fevers.</P>
<P>We are the more confirmed in the opinion we have de|livered, that the yellow fever is a native di&s;ea&s;e of our country, by di&s;covering that the &s;ame opinion is held by mo&s;t of the phy&s;icians and citizens of our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates. We lament the prevalence of an opinion, that the admi&s;&s;ion of truth upon this &s;ubject, will injure the credit of our ci|ty. Truth, upon all &s;ubjects, is ultimately friendly to general intere&s;t and happine&s;s, while the remedies of the evils of error, are always of a partial and tran&s;itory nature. We conceive that the report of the exi&s;tence of a nature &s;o &s;ubtile as to elude the utmo&s;t force of the health-laws, and the greate&s;t vigilance of health-officers, will be much more injurious to our city, than a belief of its being deri|ved from cau&s;es which are obvious to our &s;en&s;es, and which by active exertions might be <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> and <HI>certainly</HI> re|moved, without oppre&s;&s;ing or injuring our commerce.</P>
<P>We &s;hall repeat, in this place, the means recommended by us in our former letter, with the addition of &s;ome o|thers for preventing a return of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. "Removing all tho&s;e matters from our &s;treets, gut|ters, cellars, gardens, yards, &s;tores, ponds, vaults, &amp;c. which, by putrefaction in warm weather, afford the mo&s;t frequent cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e in this country. For this purpo&s;e, we recommend the appointment of a certain number of phy&s;icians, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it &s;hall be to in&s;pect all &s;uch places in the city, the northern-liberties, and Southwark, as contain any matters capable by putrefacti|on, of producing the di&s;ea&s;e, and to have them removed.</P>
<P N="2">2. "We earne&s;tly recommend the frequent wa&s;hing of all impure parts of the city in warm and dry weather, by means of the pumps, until the water of the river Schuyl|kill can be made to wa&s;h all the &s;treets of the city: a mea|&s;ure

which we conceive promi&s;es to our citizens the mo&s;t durable exemption from billious fevers of all kinds, of dome&s;tic origin.</P>
<P N="3">3. "To guard again&s;t the frequent &s;ource of yellow fever from the noxious air in the holds of ve&s;&s;els, we re|commend the unlading &s;uch ve&s;&s;els as contain cargoes li|able to putrefaction, and the di&s;charging the balla&s;t of all ve&s;&s;els at a di&s;tance from the city, during the months of June, July, Augu&s;t, September, and October. To pre|vent the generation of noxious air in the holds of ve&s;&s;els, we conceive every ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be obliged by law to carry and u&s;e a ventilator, and we recommend, in a particular manner, the one lately invented by Mr. Benjamin Wyn|koop. We believe this invention to be one of the mo&s;t important and u&s;eful that has been made in modern times, and that it is calculated to prevent not only the decay of &s;hips and cargoes, but a very frequent &s;ource of pe&s;tilen|tial di&s;ea&s;es of all kinds in commercial cities."</P>
<P N="4">4. The filling up, or cleaning the docks in &s;uch a man|ner, that no matters capable of putrefaction, &s;hall be ex|po&s;ed to the rays of the &s;un at low water.</P>
<P N="5">5. The clo&s;ing the common &s;ewers, &s;o as to admit wa|ter only, and the daily removal of the filth of the city, de|&s;tined to flow into them, by means of covered carts or waggons made for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. The prevention of the filth of the city from being ac|cumulated, and &s;tagnating in its neighbourhood.</P>
<P N="7">7. The prohibition of allies and narrow &s;treets in the future improvement of the city.</P>
<P N="8">8. An alteration of the pre&s;ent health law, which, by detaining ve&s;&s;els with peri&s;hable cargoes for ten days at the ho&s;pital, in hot weather, is calculated to increa&s;e the foul air in their holds; and we recommend al&s;o, that no ve&s;&s;el, owned by a citizen of Philadelphia, be permitted to leave or to enter our ports, that is not provided with a ventilator.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude our letter by deprecating, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner&punc; the continuance of a belief in the &s;uppo|&s;ed importation of our fever, an opinion which has led to the total negligence of the means of preventing its return; al&s;o by humbly hoping, that a merciful Providence may not correct our ignorance and prejudices by frequent re|turns

<HEAD>DESULTORY OBSERVATIONS and REFLECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE following ob&s;ervation made by Mr. Charles Holt, in his account of the yellow fever as it appeared at New-London, in the fall of 1798, is equally applica|ble to this and to every other city attacked with pe&s;tilence: "What &s;triking in&s;tances of the tran&s;itorine&s;s of life does &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e afford! We &s;ee men exulting in the bloom of youth and prime of health and &s;trength, in three or four &s;hort days numbered with the dead. Our gaye&s;t companions, our lovelie&s;t friends, in le&s;s than a week, are laid in the du&s;t. When we are daily witne&s;&s;ing the&s;e &s;cenes around us, who can avoid reflecting often, and feelingly, that, his <HI>turn may be next!</HI> yet the mind, when habitu|ated to the mo&s;t afflictive and extraordinary events, be|comes hardened, and views them with unconcern and in|difference. Di&s;ea&s;e, and death, the mo&s;t dreadful acci|dents that can afflict the human frame, when made fami|liar to the &s;ight, cea&s;e to in&s;pire dread, and are ranked with the mo&s;t common occurrences.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t appearance of the fever, many of our inhabitants had recour&s;e to &s;ome &s;ort of &s;uppo&s;ed preven|tatives again&s;t infection. Thus, &s;ome chewed garlic, o|thers &s;moaked tobacco, and others hoped to avoid the di&s;|order by having recour&s;e to &s;melling-bottles, handker|chiefs

dipped in vinegar, camphor bags, &amp;c. &s;o that few individuals could be &s;een in the &s;treets, without one or other of the&s;e applied to his no&s;trils. At la&s;t, however, experience had proved, that the&s;e were inefficaciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. A reliance on divine Providence &s;ucceeded, and in the mo&s;t terrible &s;tages of the di&s;order, the citizens di&s;covered the mo&s;t decent fortitude, and the greate&s;t re&s;ignation. The&s;e imaginary preventatives were therefore thrown a&s;ide.</P>
<P>It has often been &s;aid, that temperance was the be&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t infection. The ob&s;ervation, in gene|ral, is certainly ju&s;t; but it may, and, during the late calamity has, been carried too far. For my part, from what has come under my own knowledge, I have no he&s;itation in a&s;&s;erting, that to per&s;ons, who had been accu&s;tomed to live freely, nothing could be more danger|ous, than to become remarkably ab&s;temious upon the ap|pearance of this di&s;order. Per&s;ons of the above de&s;cription, &s;hould in my opinion, have continued to live in their u&s;ual manner; by which means, they would have been more likely to repel infection, or if infected, they would have more &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t the attack. But whil&s;t I con&s;ider ab&s;tinence in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as being highly improper, a &s;tate of intemperance is certainly more &s;o, for were it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, I could mention the names of &s;everal individuals, who, whil&s;t in a &s;tate of intoxication, were attacked with the fever, and in two days after, were tenants of the grave. The fate of &s;uch people might be pronounced almo&s;t with certainty: they were &s;eized with &s;ymptoms of a peculiar|ly malignant nature, and their death &s;eemed unavoidable.</P>
<P>Mr. Carey, in his account of the Yellow Fever in Phi|ladelphia, in the year 1793, mentions &s;ome di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cenes which took place, in that city, in con&s;equence of &s;ome women in labour, being greatly at a lo&s;s for want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Difficulties of the &s;ame &s;ort, occurred in New York, during the &s;ickne&s;s of 1798, but by no means in the &s;ame degree. There were however &s;everal in&s;tances of di&s;tre&s;s, in this particular, of which I &s;hall only
<PB N="46" REF="035586_0045_1005F63D3713E250">
&s;elect one. My wife was taken in labour on the 20th Sept. about 9 in the evening. I applied to many Doctors and Midwives. Some were really &s;ick; &s;ome pretended to be &s;o, and others candidly told me, that in con&s;equence of the pe&s;tilence, which prevailed in my vicinity, they would on no account attend. At five in the en&s;uing morn|ing, I applied to Mrs. Bunting, a midwife at Deans dock Greenwich Street, who immediately came with me. I would not have mentioned this circum&s;tance; but that it afterwards came to my knowledge, that Mrs. Bunting, in ca&s;es where the di&s;order raged with the utmo&s;t malignity, never he&s;itated to attend any per&s;ons in that &s;ituation, and that too in many ca&s;es where &s;he mu&s;t have been con|vinced, &s;he would never receive any emolument. Such in&s;tances of di&s;intere&s;ted philanthropy, ought not, in a pub|lication of this &s;ort to be omitted. They do honour to human nature.</P>
<P>No di&s;ea&s;e has, perhaps, on any previous occa&s;ion been more fatal to phy&s;icians, than that with which we were lately afflicted: for during its prevalence, exclu&s;ive of medical &s;tudents, no le&s;s than &s;ixteen phy&s;icians have been &s;wept off, in di&s;charging the perilous duties of their profe&s;&s;ion. The&s;e are Doctors Andrews, Brooks, D. Chickering, Dingley, Peter Faugeres, John B. Hicks, John B. Jones, Melchen Caldwell, Lamb, Millegan, J. B. Scandella, Elihu H. Smith, Teller, Tredwell, Va|rick, and Young. As all the&s;e gentlemen fell &s;acrifices to their endeavours to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, it might appear invidious, were I to point out tho&s;e, who in my opinion were mo&s;t u&s;eful and eminent in their profe&s;&s;ion. I &s;hall therefore only mention the ca&s;e of J. B. Scandella, who, being a foreigner of di&s;tingui&s;hed literary abilities, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t philanthropic principles, along with the others, fell a &s;acrifice to his humanity. This gentleman was a native of Venice, and de&s;cended of one of the mo&s;t noble families in that country. He was, however, more di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;pelndour of his ta|lents, than by the nobility of his birth. A liberal curio&s;i|ty had led him to this country, when he had ju&s;t fini&s;hed his re&s;earches, and was preparing to embark for Europe,
<PB N="47" REF="035586_0046_1005F63FF5B0DF80">
when motives of humanity led him back to Philadelphia, in the height of the late Epidemic. From thence he re|turned in &s;ix days, having previou&s;ly contracted that fatal di&s;ea&s;e, of which he expired, after a &s;hort, though very painful illne&s;s, in the bloom of his age, and the vigour of his faculties. The great attention which was paid to this unfortunate &s;tranger, by Dr. Elihu H. Smith, was like|wi&s;e in all probability, the immediate cau&s;e of his death.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that although, there were, during the time of this pe&s;tilence, about 800 people in the Alms Hou&s;e, no more than 24 died in all, and of the&s;e, only 7 of the di&s;order. It is likewi&s;e certain that the&s;e 7, caught the pi&s;temper in the city, and that, in no in&s;tance, contagion was communicated from one to another in that building. This uncommon healthine&s;s in a place, where there were &s;o many people together, may, in all probabili|ty be attributed to its airy &s;ituation, the &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s of the rooms, the remarkable cleanline&s;s in&s;i&s;ted upon by the manager Mr. Dodge, and the liberal u&s;e of lime.</P>
<P>It has been remarked, that during the &s;everal vi&s;itations of yellow fever, with which different cities of the United States have been afflicted, that more men than women have died of the di&s;order, in the proportion in general of about four to three; but during the pe&s;tilence of la&s;t au|tumn, in this city, the proportion of the men who were cut off was &s;till greater; there being very nearly about two men for one woman. This di&s;proportion, however, of the fatality to the two &s;exes, need not appear &s;trange, when we con&s;ider that men, by the nature of their employ|ment, are more expo&s;ed to infection than women. The man having occa&s;ion to bu&s;tle about from one place to another, whil&s;t the woman's particular province is the &s;u|perintendance of the family concerns.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="035586_0047_1005F641974B26680">
It has been formerly a&s;&s;erted by &s;everal phy&s;icians of eminence, that the blacks were much le&s;s &s;ubject to the ravages of the Yellow Fever, than the whites. This opin|ion was no doubt productive of con&s;iderable utility to the citizens of Philadelphia, during their affliction of the year 1793, as the people of colour were almo&s;t exclu&s;ively the only per&s;ons, who would venture to nur&s;e the &s;ick. The idea, however, that they ran no ri&s;que of receiving infec|tion appeared fallacious, as many of them died in that city&punc; during the time of that &s;ickne&s;s. I may add, that during our late calamity, I have every rea&s;on to believe that the fatality was fully as great among&s;t the blacks, as the whites in proportion to their numbers. This, however, may not appear to a number of my readers, when they find in my li&s;t containing the number of per&s;ons interred in each of the burying grounds of this city, that I have only men|tioned 41 negroes. It ought therefore to be ob&s;erved, that exclu&s;ive of the&s;e 41 who were buried in what is call|ed the <HI>Negroes Burying Ground,</HI> there were no doubt, &s;ix times that number buried in the Potter's field, at Belle|vue, and in &s;ome of the grave yards of this city.</P>
<P>Some extracts of letters from Philadelphia, publi&s;hed in our new&s;papers in this city, announce, that there are &s;till &s;everal ca&s;es of yellow fever among&s;t them. There are al&s;o reports to the &s;ame purpo&s;e with re&s;pect to its ex|i&s;tence among&s;t us, Jan. 16th; but upon the mo&s;t particular enquiry of a number of re&s;pectable Phy&s;icians, and others, I cannot find a &s;ingle in&s;tance of its having been &s;een here for the&s;e &s;everal weeks pa&s;t: And I am almo&s;t convinced, that the &s;ituation of the Philadelphians is as healthy at pre&s;ent as ours.</P>
<P>Many publications have been i&s;&s;ued on the &s;ubject of the Yellow Fever, by gentlemen of literary talents. I have it from good authority, that another will &s;oon make its ap|pearance, written by Doctor Hitchcock.</P>

<HEAD>The POOR, AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY WERE RELIEVED, In the City, at Bellevue, and in the Debtors Appartment.</HEAD>
<P>IN a calamity &s;o terrible and unexpected, the di&s;tre&s;s of of the labouring poor were unavoidably great. The general &s;tagnation of bu&s;ine&s;s had deprived them of their ordinary means of &s;upport and rendered them unable to remove where employment and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence might be had. To add to their difficulties, their employers, and more affluent acquaintances, who might have been di&s;po&s;ed to relieve their wants, had in general fled.</P>
<P>But the&s;e were not the only objects of commi&s;eration. Many, who had &s;upported them&s;elves and families in an ea&s;y, though not affluent manner, were from the impo&s;&s;i|bility of earning any thing, the difficulty of recovering their little debts and the heavy expences incident to a &s;tate of &s;ickne&s;s, reduced to the mo&s;t extreme di&s;tre&s;s, whil&s;t others, in opulent circum&s;tances, having remained in the city, after their connexio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s had removed, being &s;uddenly &s;eized with the prevailing di&s;order, were le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t helple&s;s by them&s;elves, without a friend to con&s;ole them, a phy&s;ician to pre&s;cribe for them or a nur&s;e to admini&s;ter the pre|&s;cription.</P>
<P>The Health Commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed by authority of the State Legi&s;lature, had hitherto exerted their utmo&s;t endeavours to alleviate the various afflictions of the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed, but the Common Council being informed that the number of &s;ick had become &s;o great and were &s;till encrea&s;|ing, that the Commi&s;&s;ioners could not take care of them all, that the accommodations at <HI>Bellevue</HI> were in&s;ufficient and that many of the poor &s;ick were &s;o circum&s;tanced as to render a removal there both inconvenient and impro|per, on the 10th September appointed <HI>Gabriel Furman; John B.

<P>The gentlemen &s;o appointed, totally di&s;regarding their <HI>own</HI> pre&s;ervation, and only intent on arre&s;ting the progre&s;s of the di&s;order and relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, with a magna|nimity and patrioti&s;m meriting the highe&s;t eulogiums, rea|dily &s;tept forth and by their generous, &s;tedfa&s;t and bene|volent exertions, undoubtedly &s;aved many of their fel|low citizens from penury, di&s;ea&s;e and death. As &s;oon as they accepted the appointment to this arduous under|taking, they immediately proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s and ap|pointed Alderman Gabriel Furman their chairman, a gentleman, who together with Alderman Beekman had been on the committee for the relief of the &s;ick and indi|gent in the years 1793 and 1794, and al&s;o during the pe&s;|tilential di&s;order of 1795. I have already ob&s;erved, that one of the objects for which the committee was appoint|ed was to make &s;uch further buildings and accommodati|ons for the &s;ick at Bellevue as they with the advice of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Health-Office might think nece&s;&s;ary. They accordingly gave orders for the erection of two buildings, one of which &s;hould be &s;ixty feet in length by twenty in breadth, for the accommodation of the &s;ick, and another of the &s;ame extent, but two &s;tories in height, for the reception of the convale&s;cents; and &s;uch was the di&s;|patch of the workmen employed in that bu&s;ine&s;s, that both were compleated in about eight days.</P>
<P>Previous to this the &s;ick, the convale&s;cent and the dying were all crowded together, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e apartments were by no means &s;ufficient for the number of the di&s;ea&s;ed; but by this humane attention, the convale&s;cents were &s;eparat|ed from the &s;ick, and from that time the number of tho&s;e who recovered at that ho&s;pital was much greater in pro|portion than it had been before. There was likewi&s;e other circum&s;tances which no doubt greatly contributed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> happy change. The attendants and nur&s;es, at fir&s;t ap|pointed
<PB N="51" REF="035586_0050_1005F64A4F28B4F0">
for the care of the &s;ick, were in general per&s;ons of rather indifferent character, and of cour&s;e that attenti|on was not paid to the &s;ick which the Commi&s;&s;ioners could have wi&s;hed. The truth is that at the commence|ment of this melancholy bu&s;ine&s;s, fear pervaded the &s;tout|e&s;t heart and terror was depicted in the countenances of mo&s;t people; hence many per&s;ons of irreproachable cha|racter and humane di&s;po&s;itions, who in other circum&s;tances would have been very willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t their fellow crea|tures, were deterred from entering on &s;o perilous an un|dertaking. The Health Commi&s;&s;ioners, therefore, to whom the care of this Ho&s;pital was committed, had no choice. Nur&s;es and attendants mu&s;t be had, and as they could not procure the mo&s;t proper per&s;ons, they were obliged to be contented with &s;uch as they could obtain.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e, however, was now changed. People began to recover from the panic with which they had been &s;truck, and notwith&s;tanding every di&s;couraging circum&s;tance, ma|ny were found who&s;e humanity would not permit them to withhold from their fellow creatures that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they in a &s;imilar &s;ituation had a right to expect; nur&s;es of good character were accordingly found, and the former improper per&s;ons were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Doctor Bayley, the Health-Officer, who&s;e character as a phy&s;ician is too well known to require any panegyric, aided by two a&s;&s;i&s;tants, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Doctor Dougla&s;s and Doctor Gregory, attended on the &s;pot, and in a &s;hort time the greate&s;t order and regu|larity was introduced; the patients were treated with the utmo&s;t care and tenderne&s;s; the nur&s;es and attendants di&s;charged their re&s;pective duties with fidelity; and <HI>Belle|vue</HI> in&s;tead of being con&s;idered as the anti-chamber of the grave, began to be viewed, by many of the afflicted as a place where they &s;tood a greater chance of recovery than any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>That cleanline&s;s is not only very conducive to health, but that it contributes greatly to the removal of di&s;order from tho&s;e who are afflicted, and al&s;o very much tends to prevent the &s;preading of infection among&s;t their attendants will &s;carcely be denied. The experience of every one who has been conver&s;ant among&s;t tho&s;e afflicted with pe|&s;tilential di&s;orders, in every age and in every country abundantly confirms this fact; and &s;urely this excellent
<PB N="52" REF="035586_0051_1005F64BF7A8E6C0">
pre&s;ervative and remedy was never better ob&s;erved than here.</P>
<P>Upon the commi&s;&s;ioners taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place, the walls, timber, and every part both in&s;ide and out&s;ide were whitewa&s;hed, and the practice of whitewa&s;hing the in&s;ide every week, ten days or fortnight, according to the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and number of &s;ick, was &s;teadily pur|&s;ued &s;ince its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment. Another practice never omitted was, that if at any time in the cour&s;e of a per&s;on's being confined with fever, his bed, &s;hirt or linen were &s;tained or &s;oiled by vomiting or otherwi&s;e, they were <HI>immediately</HI> removed and replaced with clean ones; be|&s;ides the linnen and bed clothes of the &s;ick were u&s;ually changed every day or two, if even tho&s;e extraordinary circum&s;tances did not occur. The&s;e means, as a &s;y&s;tem of cleanline&s;s, were &s;teadily adhered to by the attendants at this Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>The whole number of per&s;ons admitted from Augu&s;t 1&s;t to 3d. November, &s;ince which time none have been received, was three hundred and eighty-nine, of whom two hundred and eighty-nine were from the city and one hundred &s;eamen; of the former one hundred and &s;eventy two died and one hundred and &s;eventeen were di&s;charged. The latter were more fortunate, for of them only thirty-three died and the other &s;ixty-&s;even were di&s;charged.</P>
<P>From the above &s;tatement, which may be depended up|on as correct, the following que&s;tion naturally occurs. How came it that a much greater proportion of &s;eamen recovered at this Ho&s;pital, than of tho&s;e &s;ent thither from the city? The an&s;wer is this. The &s;eamen were in ge|neral &s;ent therein the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order, whereas many of our citizens from the fears which they entertained of that Ho&s;pital, could not be prevailed upon to be re|moved thither till they were pa&s;t recovery. In confirma|tion of this I may add that of a good many people whom I my&s;elf have &s;een previous to their being carried thither, by far the greater part of tho&s;e who were removed on the fir&s;t attack recovered, whereas to tho&s;e who remained till the di&s;order had acquired a greater degree of malignancy little el&s;e was to be expected but death. Indeed &s;everal died within a few hours after their entrance in the Ho&s;pi|tal and more than a third in two days. There is one
<PB N="53" REF="035586_0052_1005F64F72723AF8">
thing very remarkable with re&s;pect to the attendants at this Ho&s;pital, which ought not to be omitted. Their &s;ituati|on to mo&s;t people mu&s;t no doubt have appeared peculiar|ly dangerous, as they were literally &s;urrounded with pe&s;ti|lence. It &s;o happened, however, that neither nur&s;es, nor wa&s;herwomen caught the infection. The boatmen too be|longing to the Health-Office, who entered the Ho&s;pital at all times and were not only engaged in bringing the &s;ick from the city and &s;hipping, but likewi&s;e in removing them from place to place, enjoyed a &s;tate of perfect health; and of tho&s;e per&s;ons who accompanied their friends and rela|tives, &s;tayed with them and nur&s;ed them, there is not a &s;in|gle in&s;tance of an individual being infected. In &s;hort, Dr. Dougla&s;s was the only per&s;on re&s;iding there who was &s;eized with fever; but he had been in the habit of occa&s;ionally vi&s;iting his friends in the city, and three days previous to his being taken ill, had &s;lept in a hou&s;e the vicinity of which was highly infected; and it is more than probable that his &s;ickne&s;s was occa&s;ioned by that cau&s;e.</P>
<P>From the above, and many other facts which might be mentioned, it amounts to a certainty that this fever will not &s;pread in a <HI>pure air.</HI> For this rea&s;on the inhabitants of the country have little or no rea&s;on of being afraid to receive the &s;ick who remove from town, nor of tho&s;e who are taken ill with fever after leaving the city&punc; for, as is ob&s;erved by Mr. Noah Web&s;ter, junior, <HI>in his conclud|ing ob&s;ervations to a collection of papers on the &s;ubject of bilious fevers,</HI> publi&s;hed in the year 1796. "The panic that &s;eized the whole continent, when the di&s;ea&s;e in Phi|ladelphia, is now found to have been needle&s;s and with|out ju&s;t cau&s;e; and it is pre&s;umed, that &s;uch inhuman caution and barbarous mea&s;ures as were adopted on that occa&s;ion, will never again di&s;grace our country."</P>
<P>Having thus given an account of the Ho&s;pital at Belle|vue, and of the treatment of the &s;ick, I now proceed&punc; to point out the manner of admini&s;tering relief to &s;uch &s;ick per&s;ons as could not be accommodated there, or the &s;itu|ation of who&s;e per&s;ons or families rendered their removal improper or inconvenient.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to accommodations there was no doubt a con&s;iderable difficulty previous to the erection of the two additional buildings which I have already mentioned; but
<PB N="54" REF="035586_0053_1005F65205F5D548">
the&s;e being compleated, that difficulty was entirely re|moved.</P>
<P>When individuals, who had no families were &s;eized with the di&s;order, and were incapable of providing for them|&s;elves the nece&s;&s;ary relief, it was the wi&s;h of the commit|tee that they &s;hould be removed to Bellevue as &s;peedy as po&s;&s;ible. By which means the progre&s;s of the di&s;order might be arre&s;ted, whil&s;t the chance of their recovery was as great at lea&s;t if not greater than if they had remained in the city. But to &s;eparate children from their parents, hu&s;|bands from their wives, or wives from their hu&s;bands, or in &s;hort to have removed contrary to their inclinations, a &s;ingle individual from any family, where perhaps they had re&s;olved to remain by each other, &s;o the la&s;t extremity, would have been an act of the greate&s;t inhumanity. For &s;uch, therefore, it was nece&s;&s;ary that provi&s;ion &s;hould be made by the committee.</P>
<P>They accordingly being &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;erable &s;itua|tion to which the poor mu&s;t be reduced by the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of all bu&s;ine&s;s and the di&s;tre&s;s they mu&s;t &s;uffer when at|tacked by di&s;ea&s;e, devoted their &s;ole and undivided at|tention to their relief.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e they adverti&s;ed in the public prints, that the more ea&s;ily and effectually to an&s;wer the end of their benevolent appointment, they would daily attend at the Alms-Hou&s;e from 9 to 1 and from 3 to 6 afternoon, to receive the applications of the &s;ick, the widow and or|phan, or their friends in their behalf, and to grant &s;uch relief as the liberality of the Common Council of the city had directed.</P>
<P>The Common Council, at an early period of the di&s;|order, had borrowed a &s;um of money to be appropriated towards the above benevolent purpo&s;e, and about the lat|ter end of September, Mr. John Murray, junior, a re|&s;pectable merchant of this city, generou&s;ly offered to the Committee to guarantee a farther loan of ten thou&s;and dollars, if it &s;hould be wanted; but the charitable donati|ons received from different parts of this &s;tate, from New-Jer&s;ey and Connecticut; and al&s;o from many of our own wealthy citizens rendered this mea&s;ure unnece&s;&s;ary. By their beneficence and humanity the Committee were en|abled to afford to the nece&s;&s;itous a con&s;iderable degree of
<PB N="55" REF="035586_0054_1005F65476DA2128">
comfort, of which they would otherwi&s;e have been de|prived. Liberal donations of money, produce, &amp;c. (a li&s;t of which is annexed) were daily received and di&s;tributed as each particular ca&s;e &s;eemed to require.</P>
<P>As during the ravages of this dreadful di&s;order, medical aid was an object of the fir&s;t concern, it may not be im|proper to mention the manner in which the poor were ac|commodated in this re&s;pect. Early in the &s;ickne&s;s many of our mo&s;t eminent phy&s;icians had le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the city, and &s;eve|ral of tho&s;e who remained had paid the la&s;t debt to nature. Hence the bu&s;ine&s;s of practitioners was greatly increa&s;ed, and the &s;ituation of the indigent became peculiarly di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing. The committee, therefore, employed three phy&s;icians to admini&s;ter to the relief of &s;uch &s;ick as unfor|tunately became objects of their appointment, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Doc|tors Hugh M'Lean, Daniel M. Hitchcock, and Adolphus C. L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nt.</P>
<P>The extreme a&s;&s;iduity and humanity which the&s;e gentle|men di&s;played in the di&s;charge of their duty, is well known to the afflicted poor; and places their conduct in &s;uch a point of view as to be far above any panegyric of mine. To no per&s;on could their diligence be better known than to me, and in ju&s;tice to them I think it my duty to declare that notwith&s;tanding the great fatigue and danger to which they were continually expo&s;ed, they with the greate&s;t ala|crity daily &s;u&s;tained the perilous ta&s;k of vi&s;iting and admi|ni&s;tering the nece&s;&s;ary medicine to hundreds of their afflic|ted fellow creatures. From morning to night they were ince&s;&s;antly engaged; nor did any of them, when called up|on to &s;ee a patient, even at the mo&s;t un&s;ea&s;onable hours, he&s;itate a moment to wait upon them, let the di&s;order be ever &s;o malignant. Thanks to heaven their valuable lives are &s;pared, and long, very long, may they live in the grateful remembrance of their fellow citizens. How ma|ny owe their &s;afety to their &s;kill and attention it is not ea&s;y to determine; but this far may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that there are many now in good health, who but for their &s;kill and attention would have been tenants of the grave. But had the attention of the committee been confined to pro|curing phy&s;icians for the &s;ick, it would have been produc|tive of little good, for I have known many ca&s;es where the hu&s;band and wife with &s;ome others of the family were
<PB N="56" REF="035586_0055_1005F65619BAD678">
&s;o grievou&s;ly afflicted as to be incapable of furni&s;hing each other <HI>even</HI> with a cup of water.</P>
<P>For &s;uch per&s;ons nur&s;es were therefore to be provided at the public expence; and here the &s;ame difficulty at fir&s;t occurred in procuring good ones as at Bellevue. This, however, was &s;oon got over, as the committee hav|ing adverti&s;ed that nur&s;es of good character were wanted, to whom generous wages would be paid, a &s;ufficient num|ber of decent people readily offered their &s;ervice. Some indeed were found to act improperly; but when the ca&s;e was repre&s;ented to the Committee, they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and others &s;ub&s;tituted in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides procuring nur&s;es for the relief of the poor, the committee were frequently under the nece&s;&s;ity of geting them for &s;ome of tho&s;e in affluent circum&s;tances, who&s;e friends had probably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">led, or who, if they remained, knew not to whom they &s;hould apply for the nece&s;&s;ary help. To the&s;e, likewi&s;e, the committee directed their attention.</P>

The tru&s;tees of the Di&s;pen&s;ary in their report on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, make the following very judicious re|mark, "The great proportion of ca&s;es of the Yellow Fe|ver in this &s;tatement, whil&s;t it affords the mo&s;t undeniable evidence of the utility of the in&s;titution, is al&s;o an honor|able proof of the talents and a&s;&s;iduity of their phy&s;ician Doctor Hugh M'Lean, more e&s;pecially when it is con&s;i|dered that the objects con&s;i&s;ted of the poore&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;titute cla&s;s of citizens."</P>
<P>As the di&s;order continued to make farther progre&s;s, the committee found the calls on their humanity daily encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>The indigent &s;ick were indeed &s;upplied with medical aid and nur&s;es; but it was nece&s;&s;ary that provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for their maintainance, and al&s;o for a number of families, the heads of which not being able to find any employment, were in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>With a view to relieve &s;uch per&s;ons, the committee e&s;tabli&s;hed three repo&s;itories and cook &s;hops, one at Cliff-&s;treet, another at No. 159 Chatham-&s;treet and the third <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the head of Divi&s;ion-&s;treet, from whence &s;uch indigent and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ick, as were deprived of the means of providing for them&s;elves, were liberally &s;upplied with &s;oups, boiled meat, bread, candles, and other proper and nece&s;&s;ary arti|cles &s;uitable to their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Perhaps, in &s;uch a calamity, no e&s;tabli&s;hments could have been devi&s;ed of more general utility than the&s;e cook hou&s;es; the &s;ituation of many of the &s;ick being &s;uch, as would not admit of their nur&s;es leaving them to dre&s;s the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions; to which it may be added, that if money had been given to &s;ome of them for the purcha&s;e of nece&s;&s;aries, it would have very probably been expended for articles, which, in&s;tead of contributing to the relief of the &s;ick, might have been highly detrimental, or it might have been appropriated to their own u&s;e. I may likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that if pecuniary aid had been been afforded to &s;ome of the more thoughtle&s;s and di&s;&s;ipated poor, they would very probably have &s;pent it, in procuring for them|&s;elves a temporary gratification, whil&s;t their &s;tarving fami|lies remained neglected.</P>
<P>In confirmation of this, I &s;hall adduce one in&s;tance out of a few others, of a &s;imilar nature which came under my
<PB N="58" REF="035586_0057_1005F65C3ABB00F0">
own ob&s;ervation. The wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e of a per&s;on whom I had oc|ca&s;ion to &s;ee, in the di&s;charge of my duty, was dangerou&s;ly ill of the prevailing fever. She lay in a damp cellar and was de&s;titute of every nece&s;&s;ary and comfort. Of money entru&s;ted to me by the committee for the relief of the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed, I therefore left with the hu&s;band two dollars, one of which I wi&s;hed to be appropriated to the purcha&s;e of half a load of wood, and the other for &s;uch little articles as might be immediately nece&s;&s;ary for his wife and child. I called again at the hou&s;e a few hours after, but in&s;tead of finding the money applied as I expected, I found the man in a &s;tate of intoxication, and totally regardle&s;s and in&s;en|&s;ible of the &s;ituation of his afflicted wife, who was then in the agonies of death. She died &s;oon after; the funeral was conducted by &s;trangers, by whom likewi&s;e their child about &s;ix years of age, was carried to the Alms-hou&s;e, whil&s;t the unhappy hu&s;band remained in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;i|bility, knowing or caring very little about what had hap|pened.</P>
<P>I am happy, however, in ob&s;erving, that &s;uch remarks mu&s;t be under&s;tood as applying to very few, for almo&s;t in every in&s;tance, parents and children; hu&s;bands and wives, and in &s;hort all tho&s;e living in the &s;ame family were di&s;po|&s;ed to contribute to the very utmo&s;t in their power, to|wards the relief of their afflicted relatives.</P>
<P>The number of tho&s;e, who received their daily &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence from the&s;e cook hou&s;es, during the greate&s;t part of the calamity, amounted to between 1600 and 2000 per|&s;ons, of whom many were helple&s;s &s;ick, widows and or|phans; whil&s;t eight hundred people were, at the &s;ame time, &s;upported in the Alms-hou&s;e, out of funds provided by law.</P>
<P>But the ample donations and very liberal contributions, which as I have already ob&s;erved, were collected in many places, for our relief, whil&s;t it reflected the highe&s;t honour, on the donors, and demanded our warme&s;t gratitude, al&s;o enabled the committee to relieve many of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in a different manner.</P>
<P>The cook-hou&s;es were certainly highly u&s;eful; but there were many &s;ick and indigent, who lived at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance from either of them, to whom it would have been very inconvenient to have procured from thence the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions&punc; and the circum&s;tances of others
<PB N="59" REF="035586_0058_1005F65EC54C1FF8">
&s;eemed likewi&s;e to require a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a different na|ture&punc;</P>
<P>The produce which came from various parts of the country for the relief of the indigent, except what was &s;ent to the cook-hou&s;es by order of the committee, was depo|&s;ited in a &s;tore oppo&s;ite the Alms-hou&s;e; from whence upwards of five hundred families were from time to time relieved by donations in nece&s;&s;aries, &s;uch as beef, pork, mutton, flour, fowls, indian meal, potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. For the relief of the&s;e, the committee likewi&s;e expended a great deal of money, by giving them occa&s;ionally &s;uch &s;mall &s;ums as the &s;ituation of their families &s;eemed to require; and &s;everal widows, who upon the death of their hu&s;bands, wi&s;hed to remove to that place in the country where their relatives and friends re&s;ided; being de&s;titute of the means of carrying them&s;elves and children thither, were al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned, that the committee when fir&s;t organized, had adverti&s;ed, that they would meet daily at the Alms-hou&s;e, from 9 to 1, and 3 to 6, for the pur|po&s;e of attending to the benevolent object of their ap|pointment; but, in a &s;hort time the applications&punc; of the &s;ick and indigent became &s;o exceedingly numerous, that they were not able, during the&s;e hours, to determine on all their reque&s;ts. They, therefore, a&s;&s;embled during the greate&s;t part of this awful vi&s;itation at about eight in the morning, and continued their &s;itting, till &s;even, and &s;ome|times eight, in the evening, allowing them&s;elves only a bare half hour for dinner. For my part, when I think of the extreme fatigue and danger which the&s;e gentlemen encoun|tered, and the con&s;tant ri&s;que they ran of catching infec|tion, many of tho&s;e individuals who came thither to &s;olicit a&s;&s;i&s;tance, having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ever upon them, I con&s;ider their pre&s;er|vation, if not miraculous, at lea&s;t highly providential. Two of them, indeed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Alderman Gabriel Furman and Alderman Theophilus Beekman, as al&s;o our worthy May|or, who&s;e attention to the duties of his office during this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing period, is above all prai&s;e, were attacked by the pe&s;tilence, but, thanks to the Almighty, they &s;oon re|covered, and regardle&s;s of danger, immediately repaired to their po&s;t, and along with their colleagues went through the fatiguing bu&s;ine&s;s of their appointment with alacrity to the la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="035586_0059_1005F661A1F8D2B8">
It need &s;carcely be ob&s;erved, that the ta&s;k of the com|mittee in admini&s;tering relief, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, would in many ca&s;es be delicate, embarra&s;&s;ing and di&s;agreeable; for had they given indi&s;criminately to every per&s;on who &s;olicited aid, liberal as the contributions of our fellow ci|tizens were, they would have been productive of little utility to tho&s;e who were really in need.</P>
<P>The donations were certainly given for the relief of the indigent &s;ick, and for widows and orphans of this de&s;crip|tion; but &s;uch was the meanne&s;s of &s;ome po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con|&s;iderable property, and even proprietors of hou&s;es, that they too became applicants for part of a fund exclu&s;ively intended for the relief of the helple&s;s.</P>
<P>It was fortunate that every individual of the Committee were either natives of this city, or at lea&s;t had a long time re&s;ided in it. They were, of cour&s;e, generally qualified to judge how far the tales of woe related by many of the ap|plicants for charity were true. There were, however, numbers with whom they could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e acquainted, parti|cularly foreigners, who had only for a &s;hort time re&s;ided in this country.</P>
<P>To a&s;certain the truth of their complaints, when they appeared doubtful, the Committee had &s;everal attendants, part of who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to repair to the re&s;pective re|&s;idences of &s;uch applicants, to enquire into their circum|&s;tances and to report accordingly. It was, likewi&s;e, the duty of the&s;e per&s;ons to vi&s;it the indigent &s;ick, to examine into their &s;ituations, to repre&s;ent their ca&s;es, to relieve their immediate wants out of money entru&s;ted to them for that purpo&s;e, and in &s;hort to do every thing which they might be directed by the Committee, or their own pru|dence might &s;ugge&s;t, towards the mitigation of the &s;uffer|ings of individuals, or to &s;top the progre&s;s of the deadly pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the&s;e men was, no doubt, perilous in the extreme; but &s;uch was the goodne&s;s of Divine Pro|vidence, that out of eleven &s;o employed by the Health Committee and the Health Commi&s;&s;ioners, one only lo&s;t his life, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Mr. Wynant Mitchell, who&s;e character can be &s;ummed up in a very few words. He was an indu&s;tri|ous, benevolent and hone&s;t man, and has left a wife and three children to lament his lo&s;s. Mr. Munmouth Purdy, who volunteered in the &s;ame &s;ervice likewi&s;e fell a victim of his philanthropy.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="035586_0060_1005F6640F8F3338">
Having thus de&s;cribed the manner in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he poor were relieved throughout the city, it may not be improper to direct the attention of my readers to the &s;ituation of the poor pri&s;oners in the <HI>Debtor's Apartment,</HI> or what is com|monly called the <HI>New Gaol.</HI> The di&s;order, which pre|vailed more or le&s;s, in the city, likewi&s;e made its appear|ance here: It, however, in a &s;hort time entirely &s;ub&s;ided, owing in a great mea&s;ure to the indefatigable indu&s;try of Mr. William W. Parker, the jailor, in cleaning and wa&s;h|ing the different apartments, by which means the farther &s;preading of the infection was prevented.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the debtors at the commencement of the general calamity afforded a picture of di&s;tre&s;s and horror &s;carcely equalled by any thing we have hitherto &s;een repre&s;ented. Their number at fir&s;t amounted to 163 and whil&s;t others were enjoying advantages re&s;ulting from the whole&s;ome laws of the &s;tate, the&s;e individuals were pent up in the mid&s;t of pe&s;tilence, deprived of the privilege of &s;eeking their &s;elf pre&s;ervation, expo&s;ed to the un&s;atiated revenge of individuals, and &s;eemed in every re&s;pect deli|vered up as victims to the malignancy of the common enemy.</P>
<P>But the danger of infection was not the only evil to which the&s;e unfortunate men were expo&s;ed; for it is well known that though a per&s;on confined for crimes is &s;upport|ed by the &s;tate, a poor debtor has no other dependence than on the benevolence of his friends and the charity of the Humane Society: But upon the approach of this ge|neral di&s;tre&s;s, many of their friends, who would have wil|lingly a&s;&s;i&s;ted them had fled, others were &s;ick, and &s;ever|als no doubt &s;o reduced by the general calamity as to be &s;carcely capable of &s;upporting them&s;elves. In this &s;itua|tion, therefore, not only pe&s;tilence, with &s;carcely a proba|ble chance of e&s;cape, but al&s;o famine &s;tared them in the face.</P>
<P>Their ca&s;e was repre&s;ented to the Committee by Mr. Parker, and they were immediately &s;upplied with plenty of provi&s;ions; and this was from time to time repeated during the exi&s;tence of the fever, as often as their nece&s;&s;i|ties &s;eemed to require.</P>
<P>But the pri&s;oners were indebted to Mr. Parker for exer|tions of a different nature. By his per&s;onal a&s;&s;iduities&mdash;
<PB N="62" REF="035586_0061_1005F665A1FD56F8">
by his feeling repre&s;entations to humane creditors, the number of the pri&s;oners, which, as I have already menti|oned, amounted at fir&s;t to 163, were towards the clo&s;e of the di&s;order reduced to 39, by which means their num|bers were le&s;&s;ened and con&s;equently the danger. Nor was his benevolence confined to per&s;onal exertions; for he not only in mo&s;t in&s;tances &s;acrificed his own exertions to the general good, by relinqui&s;hing his fees, which were his chief &s;upport, but in &s;everal in&s;tances he did the duty of others by contributing him&s;elf towards the payment of lawyers fees, where they only detained the poor.</P>
<P>Such render treatment, &s;uch humane care of indigent and afflicted pri&s;oners cannot be too highly applauded, and whil&s;t it is the lot of unfortunate individuals to be impri&s;on|ed for debt, it mu&s;t be a great con&s;olation to them to be placed under the care of a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much hu|manity as Mr. Parker. Certainly &s;uch conduct ought to be mentioned not only as a tribute of applau&s;e; but as a &s;timulus to others who may be &s;imilarly &s;ituated, to do the &s;ame. In a word, Mr. Parker's treatment of his pri|&s;oners, when known, will ever meet with the approbation of all good citizens.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part of this, with re&s;pect to Mr. Parker's humanity, appeared in &s;ome of our public prints under a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nonymous &s;ignature; but from &s;uch a &s;ource nothing can be averred with certainty. It, however, gives me plea&s;ure to inform my readers, that from what I have learnt from gentlemen of veracity, who, during part of this awful period were pri&s;oners, no man could have act|ed better than Mr. Parker in &s;uch a &s;ituation.</NOTE></P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude this article, with re&s;pect to the poor, by a few general ob&s;ervations. During the whole of this calamitous period, &s;uch was the extraordinary liberality of our fellow citizens in granting donations; and &s;uch the unremitting attention of the Committee in di&s;tributing them, that notwith&s;tanding the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed were by far more numerous than at any previous period in this city; yet there was no individual at a lo&s;s for the nece&s;&s;aries of life, for medical aid, or for nur&s;es, provided the ca&s;e was made known to the Committee, who not only fat with unweari|ed patience from morning to night to li&s;ten to the ince&s;&s;|ant applications of hundreds; but as has been already ob|&s;erved, had people employed to &s;eek out for objects of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="035586_0062_1005F6686E692250">
There is one cla&s;s of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed objects, whom, as I omitted to mention in the preceding pages it may not be improper to introduce here, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the children of nece&s;&s;i|tous per&s;ons, who&s;e parents were cut off by death. Mr. Mathew Carey, in his hi&s;tory of the Malignant Fever preva|lent in Philadelphia in the year 1793, ob&s;erves, that the Bettering-Hou&s;e (Alms-Hou&s;e) there, in which &s;uch help|le&s;s objects had been u&s;ually placed, was barred again&s;t them; "Many of the&s;e little innocents (&s;ays he) were ac|tually &s;uffering for want of even common nece&s;&s;aries. The death of their parents and protectors, which &s;hould have been the &s;tronge&s;t recommendation to public charity, was the very rea&s;on of their di&s;tre&s;s, and of their being &s;hun|ned as a pe&s;tilence. The ca&s;e, however, was widely dif|ferent with us; for no &s;ooner had the parents of the&s;e lit|tle ones expired, than if they were not taken care of by &s;ome of their friends or relations, there was always &s;ome per&s;ons of humanity who would repre&s;ent their ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e to the Committee, by who&s;e orders they were immediately re|moved to a part in the Alms-Hou&s;e appropriated to their reception.</P>
<P>By the above remark, however, I would by no means wi&s;h to be under&s;tood as throwing any reflection again&s;t the citizens of Philadelphia for being deficient in point of humanity. On the contrary, many of the inhabitants di&s;|played a benevolence and philanthropy which in &s;o awful a period may be equalled, but never can be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed. But the <HI>Yellow Fever</HI> was at that time a new di&s;order, or at lea&s;t little known in the United States: and terrific as it really was, both in its appearance and effects, it &s;till excited more terror than was nece&s;&s;ary or ju&s;t. Hence in many ca&s;es humanity, friend&s;hip, parental and filial affection were all &s;wallowed up in a regard to &s;elf pre&s;ervation; and this will ever be the ca&s;e in any country when an all de|vouring pe&s;tilence makes its <HI>fir&s;t</HI> appearance. But in the la&s;t autumn the di&s;order was better known&punc; as it had re|peatedly vi&s;ited &s;ome of our mo&s;t populous cities, and ex|perience had &s;ufficiently evinced, that &s;uch per&s;ons as con|fined them&s;elves to their hou&s;es, run little, if any greater ri&s;que of infection than tho&s;e who were con&s;tantly conver&s;ant among&s;t the &s;ick. Hence, if it &s;hould be the Divine plea|&s;ure, that we &s;hould again be vi&s;ited either here or in any
<PB N="64" REF="035586_0063_1005F66AE8EE8018">
other place of the United States, by this awful di&s;order, its horrors will, in all probability, be greatly alleviated, as few will be found &s;o timorous as to be unwilling to di&s;|charge the duties of humanity to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this article, I cannot help taking no|tice of the di&s;tre&s;s in which &s;ome poor people were involv|ed in con&s;equence of the rigid manner in which &s;ome un|feeling landlords have exacted their rents. Forgetful that their poor tenants had been &s;ick, that they had large fami|lies and that they had been able to earn nothing during a calamitous &s;ea&s;on of three months, they notwith&s;tanding in&s;i&s;ted on the immediate payment of the original &s;tipula|ted bargain: In con&s;equence of which, the little property which the&s;e poor people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were &s;old by the con&s;ta|ble at vendu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and they expo&s;ed in con&s;equence thereof to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. It was natural in this time of ge|neral calamity for every unfortunate individual to look up to the committee for relief; the donations, were in|tended for the immediate exigence of the indigent and &s;ick, not for the payment of hou&s;e-rent; for, liberal as they were, had the committee thought proper to appropriate them in this manner, they would have &s;peedily been ab&s;orbed in &s;uch a manner as to fill the pockets of the rich, whil&s;t the poor would have remained in the &s;ame &s;tate of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t &s;ome landlords acted with the utmo&s;t rapa|city, the conduct of many was &s;uch as reflects the greate&s;t honour upon their characters. Of the&s;e &s;ome forgave the rent for one quarter altogether; and others have con&s;ider|ably indulged their tenants by procra&s;tinating the payment till &s;uch time as they &s;hould find it convenient. Men of this la&s;t de&s;cription have the ineffable &s;atisfaction of having contributed to the relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, whil&s;t the former being actuated by an in&s;atiable de&s;ire of gain, &s;eek only for happine&s;s in their gold, which, if they had not been determined to be blind, they could have ea&s;ily &s;een, would contribute very little towards relieving them <HI>from the yellow fever or any other pe&s;tilential di&s;order.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A LIST OF THE NAMES OF THE PERSONS INTERRED IN THE SEVERAL BURYING GROUNDS IN THE CITY OF NEW-YORK, AND AT BELLEVUE, AND POTTERS-FIELD,</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>FROM AUGUST 1&mdash;TO NOVEMBER 14, 1798.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE the Reader begins to peru&s;e the following li&s;t, I would wi&s;h to apprize him of the materials from which it is compo&s;ed. They are the books of the different &s;extons and other per&s;ons having the charge of burying grounds in this city, at Potter-Field and Bellevue. It has however unfortunately happened that the &s;extons of two of the &s;malle&s;t congregations were ab&s;ent during a great part of the calamity, and in the&s;e the names of the dead were only given by me|mory, and in other in&s;tances, the books have not been kept with that accuracy which could have been wi&s;hed. To a&s;certain with preci&s;ion the names of all the decea&s;ed, their occupations, &amp;c. I have u&s;ed my utmo&s;t exertions. With this view I have compared the books of the &s;extons with the li&s;t kept by the Health-Com|mittee, and wherever there was a difference, I have, by per&s;onal application to the friends of the decea&s;ed, endeavoured as far as po&s;&s;ible to rectify the mi&s;take, and al&s;o where the orthography appeared erroneous, to correct it as well as I could&punc; and by annexing to the names, the trade, occupation, age, place of nativity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome other circum&s;tance to point out the particular per&s;on intended and thus to remove the doubts of people at a di&s;tance. But whatever pains may be taken in a thing of this &s;ort, it cannot be expected that it will be entirely free from errors or defects: but I tru&s;t it will be found as compleat, as con&s;idering the difficulties at|tending it, could be expected and that in almo&s;t every in&s;tance it will be found &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>C. Annexed to &s;ome Names denotes that the Per&s;on died in the Country. The words printed in Italic after any name, denotes the native country of that per&s;on.</P>
