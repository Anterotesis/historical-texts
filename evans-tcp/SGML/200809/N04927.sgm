<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends and Neighbours,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER an Ab&s;ence of near &s;ix Years from this Province (my native Coun|try) and my Arrival among you, I have beheld the Faces of many of the Inhabitants whom I have known, and been known to, &s;ome Years: But the Novelty of my religious Sentiments, and Meanne&s;s of my Appearance, has, I find, render'd me de&s;picable in your Eyes; which has been obvious, when a few of us, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> have met to wor|&s;hip the Supreme Being in a Manner agreeable to the be&s;t of our Under&s;tanding and Know|ledge: And tho' &s;ome perhaps may &s;tile our Principles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Any Per&s;on who de&s;ire to be informed of the Principles of the <HI>Qua|kers,</HI> is referred to <HI>Robert Barclay's Apology,</HI> &s;ince I find we are oftentimes condemned unheard. <HI>But he that an&s;wereth a Matter before he heareth it, it is Folly and Shame unto him,</HI> Prov. xviii. 13. The <HI>Apology</HI> may be had at <HI>Mary Blamyer</HI>'s, in <HI>Charles-Town.</HI></NOTE> and Tenets by the hard Name of <HI>Here&s;y,</HI> and our Mode or Manner of Wor&s;hip, rediculous or ab&s;urd; neverthele&s;s, we are humbly of Opinion, they are neither <HI>un&s;criptural</HI> nor <HI>unchri&s;tian,</HI> having, as we think, the Sanc|tion and Authority of our Lord him&s;elf, the Example of primitive Believers, and right Rea|&s;on, on our Side.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006166_0003_1027FD1CF53A3498">But notwith&s;tanding, as I have noted, that I have &s;uffered your Ridicule and Reproach, as I am con&s;cious it is for no other than Obedience to the Will of my Heavenly Ma&s;ter, who&s;e I am, and whom I &s;erve, I am willing to become more vile in your Eyes; which, it is more than probable, I &s;hall appear, when I expo&s;e the following Lines to your Ob&s;ervation and Cen&s;ure. I would not have you imagine that any Con&s;ideration, le&s;s than his Favour, could have prevailed with me to have appeared thus publickly in Print, or otherwi&s;e; for could I, with any ea&s;e to my own Mind, have evaded this, or been excu&s;ed from returning to this Place (as I apprehended it required of me by the Al|mighty) you had never beheld my Face in the Province, much le&s;s any Performance of this Sort in publick. I am not in&s;en&s;ible, that the Rea&s;on I have offered for writing, as well as the Subject it&s;elf, may probably be con&s;idered as the Production of a di&s;temper'd and enthu&s;ia&s;tick Brain; as it is po&s;&s;ible, on &s;uch a novel and uncommon Occa&s;ion, as a Woman's appearing on the Behalf of God and Religion, you may (as others have done in the like Circum&s;tances) be induced to con&s;ider &s;uch an One under &s;ome unaccountable Delu&s;ion, or affected with religi|ous Madne&s;s; and more e&s;pecially, as the Things recommended to your Con&s;ideration, are offered by a &s;imple Female of your own Country: Some, in this Ca&s;e, I expect, will afford me a Smile of Contempt, while others (acted by a more generous Pa&s;&s;ion) pity my Folly and kindly wi&s;h me a Return of my Sen&s;es: But
<PB N="5" REF="006166_0004_1027FD1E812FB600">
however this may be, I have con&s;idered, that from the earlie&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tianity, and in|deed in all preceeding Time, tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to conform to the U&s;age and wicked Cu&s;toms of the Age, and lived a &s;elf-denying Life,
<Q>Their Lives were counted Madne&s;s by the World, and their End to be without Honour:</Q>
Not con&s;idering that Religious Minds de&s;pi&s;e and contemn all worldly Honour, and earthly pre|ferment, &s;eeking that only which comes from God, and which he is plea&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e by, who honour him (by walking in Conformity to his Laws and Precepts) as he him&s;elf declares, <HI>Tho&s;e who honour me, I will honour; but tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e me, &s;hall be lightly e&s;teemed.</HI></P>
<P>But before I proceed to what the Title-page mentions, I &s;hall premi&s;e one Propo&s;ition, on which all I have to offer will greatly depend, <HI>viz. That all Mankind have a Mea&s;ure and Ma|nife&s;tation of the Light, Spirit, or Grace of God, given them to profit withal.</HI> This Doctrine of the univer&s;al Extent of the Grace of God, the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> hold in a peculiar Man|ner, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by, from &s;ome other di&s;&s;enting Sects, who generally limit God's Gifts of his Holy Spirit, or &s;aving Means, to what they call <HI>The Elect</HI>; and a&s;&s;ert, that the re&s;t of Mankind are (as they term it) <HI>pa&s;&s;ed by,</HI> or denied the Means of Salvation, being <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To refute the Doctrine of <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> read Doctor <HI>Whitby</HI> on the <HI>New-Te&s;tament</HI>; and his Di&s;cour&s;es on the <HI>Five Controverted Points</HI>; which may be had of <HI>John Whitter,</HI> on <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>I&s;land.</HI></NOTE> prede&s;|tinated from all Eternity to De&s;truction.</P>
<P>However, we &s;ay that this Gift of the Holy Spirit, or Grace of God, is be&s;towed on all
<PB N="6" REF="006166_0005_1027FEAC6131B610">
Mankind without Exception, agreeable to the A&s;&s;ertion of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul; The Grace of God, which brings Salvation, hath appeared to all Men, teaching us, that denying Ungodline&s;s, and the World's Lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live righteou&s;ly, &s;oberly and godly, in this pre&s;ent World.</HI> But tho' all Men have received this Talent of Grace, or Manife&s;tation of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, all are not &s;aved, as Men may rebel again&s;t, or quench the Spirit; and, by fru&s;trating its Motions, render it ineffectual. Under the Law it is &s;aid, <HI>The Almighty gave of his good Spirit to the</HI> Jews <HI>to in&s;truct them, but they rebelled again&s;t it,</HI> Ne|hemiah ix. 20. And the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> al&s;o tells us, <HI>They rebelled, and vexed God's Holy Spirit.</HI> And, under the Go&s;pel, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> cautions the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians</HI> again&s;t <HI>quenching the Spirit,</HI> or extingui&s;hing the Light, and hin|dering the con&s;uming Force, that would de&s;troy Sin and Iniquity in the Heart.</P>
<P>Thus, according to the Te&s;timony I have offered, and many I might produce, all Men have received a Proportion of Light and Grace, but all have not obey'd its Leadings; all have heard, but all have not obey'd: However, this internal Monitor or Director, is ready on all Occa&s;ions (if we will apply to it for Knowledge and Help) to in&s;truct us in our Duty, and a&s;&s;i&s;t us in overcoming the Temptations of the great Adver&s;ary of our Soul's Happine&s;s; but we mu&s;t diligently attend to its Voice, and not only hear, but obey its In&s;tructions, that our Souls may live.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="006166_0006_1027DA0331E3BE68">But &s;ome have &s;aid to me, <HI>We grant that Chri&s;tians ought to walk agreeable to the Dictates of the Spirit of Chri&s;t; but the</HI> Quakers <HI>make the Guidance and Direction of the Spirit nece&s;&s;ary in trivial and indifferent Matters; nay, &s;ometimes they offer its Dictates as a Rea&s;on for many Things accounted by us irrational and ab&s;urd.</HI>&mdash;I an&s;wer; With Reference to our Duty and Obedience to the Almighty, I con&s;ider no Action indifferent; every Thing of this Nature mu&s;t tend to &s;ome Purpo&s;e, good or evil: And 'tis upon this Con|&s;ideration that we extend the Doctrine of the Cro&s;s, Self-denial and perfect Obedience to the Precepts of Chri&s;t, farther then the Generality of tho&s;e who profe&s;s the Chri&s;tian Name: And I take this Occa&s;ion to &s;ay, my principal Errand among you is to recommend, as far as I am en|abled, the&s;e Chri&s;tian Doctrines; &s;ince our Lord him&s;elf po&s;itively declares, <HI>That unle&s;s we take up a daily Cro&s;s,</HI> (to our Corrupt Wills and Affections) <HI>we cannot be his Di&s;ciples:</HI> And far|ther, to advi&s;e you to a &s;trict Adherence to the Light or Grace of God in your own Con&s;ciences or Under&s;tandings, as unto <HI>a more &s;ure Word of Prophecy,</HI> or perfect Director; <HI>whereunto you will do well to take Heed, as unto a light &s;hining in a dark Place:</HI> For the Nations of them that are &s;aved, mu&s;t walk in this Light of the Lord.</P>
<P>But it may be objected, "That many of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> have anciently bore Te&s;timony to tho&s;e Doctrines, and continue &s;o to do; then what need of my feeble Te&s;timony or Evidence?" 'Tis true that numerous Pens have been employed, and many earne&s;t Endea|vours,
<PB N="8" REF="006166_0007_1027DA23A00622A8">
and fervent De&s;ires of this People, to recommend and propagate (as far as they are enabled by divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance) tho&s;e Chri&s;tian Doctrines, which they have proved by their own happy Experience to be &s;o beneficial and advantageous to them&s;elves; and being thro' Grace made partakers of that Charity or Love, which is the Bond of Perfection, and the Cha|racteri&s;tick of a genuine and real Chri&s;tian; the&s;e, I &s;ay, by this Go&s;pel-love, are excited to wi&s;h well to all Mankind, and, as much as in them lies, they endeavour to &s;erve one ano|ther in it, as the Apo&s;tle exhorts, <HI>Gal.</HI> v. 13. And their frequent Supplications a&s;cend to the mo&s;t High, on behalf of Mankind in general, that all People may come to the Knowledge of the Truth, as it is in JESUS, and be &s;aved. And when our Hearts are thus enlarged, both to God, and one towards another, then are our Mouths opened to declare of his wonderful Works to the Children of Men, and &s;hew forth his mighty Acts, which he is able and ready to perform, by the powerful Operation of his Holy Spirit in our Hearts, in &s;ubduing every evil and inordinate De&s;ire and Affection, and bringing them under his Government, and into Subjection to his divine Will; and by &s;peaking well of his great Name, to invite and encou|rage others to <HI>come ta&s;te and &s;ee that the Lord is good,</HI> and to partake of his Offer of great Salvation, no le&s;s than the Redemption of the Soul (by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>) from the Bondage of Sin and Satan. And indeed the Peace that flows from, and the Promi&s;es annexed, to a perfect
<PB N="9" REF="006166_0008_1027DA26C1678EE0">
Obedience to the righteous Laws of God, are &s;ufficient Inducements to excite us to a godly, righteous, and Self-denying Life; for as the royal <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> greatly experienced formerly, &s;o we at this Day experience, and &s;ub&s;cribe to this Truth, That in keeping the Commandments of God there is great Reward; and that great Peace have they who love his Law, and nothing &s;hall offend them: <HI>For He &s;peaks Peace to his People, and to his Saints; but let them not turn again to Folly,</HI> P&s;alm lxxxv. 8. <HI>And the Lord will ordain Peace for the Righteous, for the Ef|fect of Righteou&s;ne&s;s is Peace and A&s;&s;urance for ever,</HI> I&s;aiah xxxii. 17. Agreeable to this our Lord tells his Di&s;ciples, <HI>My Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you; not as the World giveth,</HI> but a Peace which pa&s;&s;eth the Under|&s;tanding of the carnal Man, And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> to encourage and excite the <HI>Romans</HI> to the Obedience of the Faith deliver'd, and a pa|tient Continuance in Well-doing, tells them, Their Reward &s;hould be, <HI>Glory, Honour, and Peace, to every Man that worketh Good, to the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o to the Gentile</HI>; Rom. ii. 10. But, on the contrary, that tho&s;e who are con|tentious, and do not obey the Truth, but obey Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, Their Portion will be <HI>Indigna|tion and Wrath, Tribulation and Angui&s;h, upon every Soul of Man that doeth Evil</HI> as there is no Peace to the Wicked; for what have they to do with Peace, &s;o long as they continue in Di&s;obedience? Indeed the Wicked may, as they often do, cry Peace to them&s;elves, when there is no Peace, or at lea&s;t not a &s;olid One; as a real and &s;ub&s;tan|tial
<PB N="10" REF="006166_0009_1027DA2A56326F20">
Peace and Happine&s;s, can only re&s;ult from an Acquaintance with God, and the Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience: But a fal&s;e and polluted Re&s;t and Peace, which many are erecting to them&s;elves, will de&s;troy them with a &s;ore De|&s;truction, without timely Repentance and Amendment of Life; <HI>for in&s;tead of this Peace, they &s;hall have great Bitterne&s;s,</HI> I&s;aiah xxxviii. 17.</P>
<P>Many and &s;ingular are the Advantages and Priviledges which I might enumerate, that at|tend a Life of Piety and Holine&s;s, no le&s;s than an Hundred-fold of Peace in our Bo&s;oms in this Life, and the great and precious Promi&s;e of Life Eternal in the World to come. And as I have, by the Grace of God, and thro' Obedi|ence of Faith, witne&s;&s;ed in Degree this Peace from God, (which is beyond the Conception or tho&s;e who have never enjoyed it) I became greatly concerned for Mankind in general, and in a particular Manner for the Inhabitants of my native Country, that they might witne&s;s this Peace; and I often petitioned the Almigh|ty, that he would in his wonted Mercy di&s;co|ver to you the Things that belong to your Soul's Peace, before they might, by Unbelief, be hid from your Eyes. Having had this Con|cern for &s;ome Time on your Account, the Al|mighty was plea&s;ed to lay a Con&s;traint upon me to declare it among you. This, and what fol|lows, I am &s;en&s;ible will &s;ound as idle and ridi|culous Tales in the Ears of many; however, I &s;hall go on to tell you, that I con&s;ider my&s;elf as a very &s;eeble In&s;trument in the Cau&s;e of God, and one of the lea&s;t Servants in my
<PB N="11" REF="006166_0010_1027DA3F8FC907E8">
Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e. I have al&s;o con&s;ider'd, how backward the Generality of People are to re|ceive Advice, even when it has been offered by religious, pious and learned Men; and that the Labours of &s;uch have had but little Effect on the Minds and Conduct of many called Chri&s;|tians; and reflecting on the greatne&s;s of my In|ability, as well as the Improbability of my being &s;erviceable in God's Cau&s;e, I have been induced to &s;ay, <HI>Lord! who will believe my Report, &s;ince &s;o many have labour'd (as I have thought) in vain? Shall I, a poor Female, undertake for God? Can I pre&s;ume to come up to his Help again&s;t the great Adver&s;ary of Souls? No &s;urely; rather, I bee&s;eech thee, appear in the Glory of thy Maje&s;ty, and by the immediate Act of thy mighty Power, in the Hearts of the People, &s;ub|due and lay wa&s;te the &s;trong Holds of Sin and Satan! And in the Room thereof e&s;tabli&s;h, I be|&s;eech thee, the Kingdom and Dominion of thy dear Son, our Lord, who&s;e Right alone it is to reign in the Hearts of the People, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords!</HI> And farther, tho' I am but Du&s;t and A&s;hes, I thus pre&s;umed to excu&s;e my&s;elf; <HI>Lord, I am not eloquent, nei|ther heretofore, nor &s;ince thou ha&s;t been plea&s;ed to di&s;cover thy Will to me.</HI> But to an Almigh|ty Power, who doth according to his righteous Will, both in the Armies of Heaven, and a|mong the Inhabitants of the Earth, who &s;hall &s;ay, What do&s;t thou? And &s;ince he is plea&s;ed to &s;end by the Hand of whom he will &s;end, I no longer re&s;i&s;ted his Will, but became obedi|ent to his Word and Power, again&s;t which I
<PB N="12" REF="006166_0011_1027DA61E3A5D2F0">
had long rea&s;oned, and objected my Unfitne&s;s; tho' the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> informs us, <HI>That as ma|ny as have been baptized into</HI> CHRIST (or with his Bapti&s;m of Fire and the Holy Gho&s;t, and have witne&s;&s;ed the chaffy Nature in them con&s;umed, and by this Means) <HI>have put on</HI> CHRIST (that then there is no Di&s;tinction or Difference among Chri&s;tians in a religious Sen&s;e) <HI>there is neither Jew nor Gentile, there is neither Bond nor Free, there is neither Male nor Fe|male: For,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>ye are all one in</HI> CHRIST JESUS. Thus he &s;eems to allow our Sex the &s;ame Go&s;pel Priviledges with the re&s;t of Mankind. And the royal Prophet calls on the female, as well as the male Part of God's rational Creation, to celebrate the Prai&s;e of our common Governor and Benefactor. "Why then, &s;ays one, &s;hould Woman be denied her Canticle of Prai&s;e in the general Chorus, &s;ince out of the Mouth of Babes and Sucklings God will &s;till ordain and perfect Prai&s;e?" And we may further ob&s;erve, when the Tabernacle of the Lord was erected in the Wilderne&s;s, the Wo|men, we are told, who were willing hearted, brought their Free-will Offerings, and pre&s;ent|ed them towards the Building, or at lea&s;t em|belli&s;hing of this moveable Temple, which, 'tis &s;aid, was a Type of the true Church mi|litant, and the Tabernacle which God has pitched, and not Man. And if Females were allowed to a&s;&s;i&s;t and contribute to the Work of the Lord, under the Law, why &s;hould any, or the lea&s;t E&s;&s;ay towards the repairing the Breaches in God's Building, be rejected under

the Go&s;pel; &s;ince we do not offer or propo&s;e any new Doctrine, nor endeavour to lay any other Foundation than that which is already laid, <HI>viz,</HI> "The Revelation of the Spirit of JESUS CHRIST the Righteous, in the Soul of Man, on which the Church of CHRIST is founded and built: Nor for the moral Di&s;or|ders &s;o vi&s;ible among the Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;ti|anity, do we pre&s;cribe new or untry'd Reme|dies; but having experienced the Virtue and Efficacy of the old, we, in great Love and Good-will, endeavour to per&s;uade you to apply them: For the &s;ame Fountain of Purgation is now open to Sinners, that was in Ages pa&s;t &s;et open for the Hou&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> and Inhabitants of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> for Sin and for Uncleanne&s;s; for the Almighty is not only the God of the <HI>Jews,</HI> but of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>But to proceed; I have told you that this Voyage to my native Place, was undertaken in Pur&s;uance of what I verily believed was the Will of God concerning me, and required of me by him (I make no Doubt) as one among&s;t the many Trials I have been exerci&s;ed with, of my Faith, Love and Obedience; wherein I be|lieve it my Duty openly and freely to confe&s;s CHRIST before Men, who&s;e operating Power on my Heart I had fearfully and cowardly en|deavoured to conceal before I left this Pro|vince; and I take this Occa&s;ion to declare to you, that I am not a&s;hamed of the Go&s;pel of CHRIST, which I have in Mea&s;ure expe|rienced to be the Power of God to Salvation to all them who believe, and continue to obey

it: And the more numerous the Te&s;timonies, and greater the Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es, to the Efficacy of the Grace and Power of God, the more will the Truths and Evidences propo&s;ed and produded, be &s;trengthened and corroborated. But &s;ome may po&s;&s;ibly ask, 'How I certainly know that I am not mi&s;taken, and that in|&s;tead of being led by the Spirit of Truth, I am not deceived by the Spirit of Error?" To &s;uch I an&s;wer; I have one Rule to &s;quare my Actions by, which never yet fail'd me, when I applied it; and that is, By Application to the Divine Being, that He would be plea&s;ed to pre&s;erve me from Error and Delu&s;ion, I exa|mine, by his Divine Light and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the Motive, De&s;ign, Tendency and End of my Actions; and if I find nothing repugnant to, or incon&s;i&s;tent with the Honour of God, and Scripture Precepts or Te&s;timony, I make a ra|tional Conclu&s;ion, that I am &s;afe at lea&s;t. And tho' I do not ob&s;erve from Scripture, that it is my particular Duty to exhort you to yours; nor do I gather from thence, that I ought to declare, in this publick Manner, of the Good|ne&s;s, Mercy and Loving-kindne&s;s, of the Al|mighty, to all who &s;eek his Face and Favour in Truth, Sincerity and Uprightne&s;s; yet I find it there, my Duty to obey all God's Com|mands; and that the Almighty may, and does, lay particular Injuctions, and &s;pecial Commands, upon his Servants, by the Divine Di|rection of his Holy Spirit, at this Day, as well as in former Ages, I firmly believe: And that the Ble&s;&s;ing our Lord promi&s;ed to confer on

his immediate Followers, extends as well to all his &s;ucceeding Di&s;ciples, <HI>viz.</HI> "That he would pray the Father, and he will (&s;ays he) &s;end you another Comforter, that may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth, who will guide and lead you into all Truth, and &s;hew you Things to come; for he that dwelleth with you, &s;hall be in you; and this Comforter, which is the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;hall teach you all Things and bring all Things to your Remembrance." And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> at that memorable Time, when he was preaching to People of various Lan|guages, tells his Audience, fir&s;t quoting a Pa&s;|&s;age from the Prophet <HI>Joel,</HI> Acts ii. 38. <HI>It &s;hall come to pa&s;s in the la&s;t</HI> (or Go&s;pel) <HI>Days, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all Fle&s;h, and your Sons and your Daughters &s;hall prophecy,</HI> &amp;c.

And farther, if I would be CHRIST's Di&s;ciple, I mu&s;t deny my|&s;elf, take up a Cro&s;s to my own Will, be &s;ub|ject to, and follow him, under who&s;e Banner I had now li&s;ted; thus examining and pur&s;uing this Doctrine and Precept of our Lord's, I was naturally led, in &s;ome Degree, to what is cal|led

<HI>Quakeri&s;m</HI> (tho' it appear'd to me in no other Form nor Name, than that of primitive Chri&s;tianity) which, in my fir&s;t Thoughts of Religion, I had no more Intention of embracing than I had of receiving <HI>Mahometi&s;m</HI>; knowing little more of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> than that They were a plain People in their Garb and Speech. But it has been remarked to me, that my Mo|ther was &s;ome Time of this Per&s;ua&s;ion, and no Wonder that I &s;hould have a warm Side for her Opinion. I an&s;wer'd, My Father was a Member of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and edu|cated me in that Way; and I well remember, I had a much warmer Side for his Opinion; not that I knew what was the e&s;&s;ential Difference in their religious Sentiments, or at lea&s;t that affected me, any farther than that one allow'd me &s;omething more Liberty in Dre&s;s; whereas the other would tell me Plainne&s;s in Apparel was mo&s;t agreeable to Chri&s;tianity, and to the Divine Being, who hated Pride in his Creatures. To be &s;ure I thought this Doctrine ab&s;urd, by the Reflection I remember I made at the Time, <HI>That God, I believed, would not reject me, on the Score of wearing Lace, or a fine and gay Silk Gown.</HI> I have thought &s;ince, any one might imagine I had fetch'd my Argument from <HI>Lucretian</HI> Principles, that the Almighty could not de&s;cend &s;o low as to notice &s;uch Trifles, or mark little Follies, if Gaiety in Ap|parel &s;hould be One; but no Wonder that when I was a Child, I &s;hould rea&s;on as a Child. I am &s;en|&s;ible that Silks, Ribbons and Lace, are not any where in Scripture directly forbidden; but I

learn from thence, that Pride, and all Manner of Superfluity, is. And if, by wearing this rich Silk, or adorning our&s;elves with the other &s;u|perfluous Ornaments, we feed and nouri&s;h a proud, vain De&s;ire, it becomes by this Circum|&s;tance as unlawful as Pride it&s;elf; and that they do &s;o, I have greatly experienced: <HI>For tho' Re|ligion &s;tands not &s;imply in Clothes, yet true Reli|gion &s;tands in that which &s;ets Bounds and Limits to the Mind with re&s;pect to Clothes, as well as other Things.</HI> And to &s;trengthen this A&s;&s;ertion, or rather to prove it, I &s;hall offer an In&s;tance of my own Experience, <HI>viz. When it plea&s;ed the Lord to vi&s;it my Soul, and to appear to me in his Glory, the View of which di&s;cover'd to me my own Unworthine&s;s, and cau&s;ed me not, only to de|&s;pi&s;e and abhor my&s;elf, but my &s;plendid Apparel al&s;o: I had now no Delight in Dre&s;s and Ornament, nor other Things I had u&s;ually taken much Plea|&s;ure in: True Chri&s;tianity, which I began to be acquainted with, &s;et a Bound to my De&s;ires, and directed me to Plainne&s;s, before I had any Intention of joining the Society of the People called</HI> Quakers; <HI>and indeed all earthly and tran&s;itory Objects were, and are, in my View and E&s;timation, as Lo&s;s, Dro&s;s and Dung, in Compari&s;on of the Excellency, Glory and Beauty, I behold in God, and find in the Enjoyment of his Divine Favour; and at times I am ready to cry out,</HI> O! how great is his Glory, and tran&s;cendently great his Beauty!</P>
<P>But to return: When I was (by Marriage) remov'd from my Mother's Care and Direction, I continued in my Father's Profe&s;&s;ion of Reli|gion, for no other Rea&s;on that I remember, but
<PB N="32" REF="006166_0031_1027FD326EF9FC58">
that it allow'd me mo&s;t Liberty in Dre&s;s and Recreations, tho' my Father, as well as my Mother, did not fail to inculcate a ju&s;t Abhor|rence of the Evils the moral Law condemns. However, when I con&s;ider'd and examined re|ligious Matters with more Seriou&s;ne&s;s, Sincerity and Attention, than was u&s;ual with me, I found the little Religion (or rather the Profe&s;&s;ion of it) that I had, was that of my Education, which I could not properly call my own, as it was not the Religion of my Judgment, which I find ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and highly rea&s;onable to be concerned for. I read the Scriptures with &s;ome Attention; and I have con&s;ider'd the fol|lowing Text, that <HI>unle&s;s we deny our&s;elves, and take up a daily Cro&s;s, we cannot be CHRIST's Di&s;ciples.</HI> This Pa&s;&s;age appear'd to me to con|tain &s;ome other and further Con&s;truction and De&s;ign than many People allow, who confine it to moral Precepts and Duties. But before I proceed to &s;ay in what Sen&s;e others, as well as my&s;elf, under&s;tand this Chri&s;tian Doctrine, I think it may not be impertinent briefly to give &s;ome Rea&s;on of my Faith and Hope, which I de&s;ire to do in the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition the Apo|&s;tle recommends, <HI>viz. In Meekne&s;s and Fear.</HI> And fir&s;t, upon examining the Creed call'd <HI>The Apo&s;tles,</HI> I could &s;ub&s;cribe to every Article therein contain'd, except one, (<HI>Chri&s;t de&s;cended into Hell</HI>) which, if it be meant no other than the Grave, I &s;ub&s;cribe to that al&s;o. Next, I have con&s;idered and examined <HI>The Articles of the Church of England</HI> (of which I had profe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf a Member &s;ome Years, without &s;o much

as knowing what Doctrines or Principles they profe&s;&s;ed and held; this, I may venture to &s;ay, without Breach of Charity, is the Ca&s;e of ma|ny Profe&s;&s;ors at this Day) But upon peru&s;ing the above Articles (as well as con&s;idering the Opinion of mo&s;t di&s;&s;enting Sects) I could not reconcile &s;ome Opinions therein contained with Scripture Doctrine and Te&s;timonies; particular|ly a Paragraph in the fifteenth Article, where it is &s;aid, "Tho' we are all baptized and born again in CHRIST, yet we offend in many Things." This Opinion appears to me mani|fe&s;tly repugnant to Scripture Accounts of ma|ny, who attain'd in this Life a perfect Free|dom from Sin. And the Text farther quoted by that Church will not import the Apo&s;tle him&s;elf to be included in it, 1 <HI>John</HI> i. 8. And I am of Opinion, we may &s;afely interpret the Pa&s;&s;age by &s;ome other Scripture Text; wherein the Apo&s;tles include them&s;elves with Sinners, yet by no Means can be under&s;tood, that they them&s;elves were in the like Circum&s;tances. And now I &s;hall offer the following Scripture Te&s;timonies, which appear to corroborate, and greatly to ju&s;tify us, with regard to a Tenet we particularly hold, <HI>viz.

<P>I remember, when I experienced the Work of God's Grace operating on my Soul, and di&s;|covering to me my State and Condition, the common Prayer became of no Service to me, as I found it highly nece&s;&s;ary that my Heart &s;hould be prepared by the Lord to enable me to addre&s;s him by his own Spirit; and when he is plea&s;ed to touch and incline the Heart to him|&s;elf, behold (as it is &s;aid on a memorable Oc|ca&s;ion) <HI>we pray</HI>; We are immediately taught to pray in Terms &s;ugge&s;ted by the Holy Spirit, who be&s;t knows our Nece&s;&s;ities, helps our In|firmities, and cau&s;es us &s;uitably to approach the Throne of Grace, and to reque&s;t and pray with the Spirit, and with the Under&s;tanding.

on my Knees, but my Heart was not properly warm'd, nor influenc'd to addre&s;s the Almighty, at the Time the Congregation was told, I was giving God humble and hearty Thanks for &s;uch a Mercy; I repeated the Form indeed, but it was only with my Lips, my Heart had little Share in this formal Devotion; and reflecting, while on my Knees, that I was wrong, con&s;equently the Sacrifice of Thank&s;|giving I had offer'd in &s;o unacceptable a Man|ner, mu&s;t be an Offence to God. The above Reflection, I am not a&s;ham'd to &s;ay, cau&s;ed me to tremble at the very In&s;tant. Thus I find, that waiting to be &s;uitably influenced by the Spirit, ought to be previous to this &s;olemn Act of Wor&s;hip. But farther, as I have above no|ted, I find no Place in the Church of CHRIST for Ceremonies, as they appear to be a very great Ob&s;tacle in the Way of &s;piritual Wor&s;hip; <HI>for bodily Exerci&s;e profiteth little</HI>; 'tis the Spirit of CHRIST mu&s;t quicken us for &s;piritual Wor|&s;hip.

But it has been objected, that Recreations are ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to unbend and relax the Mind, when it has been occupy'd or employ'd in worldly Af|fairs, or in the more &s;erious Attention on divine Objects, to which it is not po&s;&s;ible it can be attending always. I grant, that our Lord's enjoining his Followers, to <HI>watch and pray con|tinually,</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI>'s exhorting the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> to <HI>pray without cea&s;ing,</HI> does not, in a &s;trict and literal Sen&s;e, oblige us to be always on our Knees, nor occupy'd in mental Prayer; for tho' we ought to be led and guided by the Spirit of CHRIST in all our Actions, or, at lea&s;t, that all we do by Permi&s;&s;ion, as well as by im|mediate Direction, may be approved in his

Sight; yet we are not at all Times under an Influence nece&s;&s;ary for addre&s;&s;ing the Throne of Grace, in the &s;olemn Act of Prayer: <HI>Neverthe|le&s;s, we &s;hould always be &s;o far in a Spirit of Prayer and Watchfulne&s;s, as we ought to be al|ways in a Chri&s;tian and virtuous Temper of Mind</HI>; which is indeed truly and effectually wor&s;hipping the Divine Being, when we do not confine our Service to &s;et Days, or appoint|ed Hours of Devotion, but to a con&s;tant, &s;tea|dy and uniform Life of Virtue, Piety and Ho|line&s;s. Some are apt to think all is well, and they have done their Duty to God, when they neglect not cu&s;tomary times of formal Prayer, or Devotion (as it is fal&s;ely called) or their Di|ver&s;ions don't interfere with this Formality, which by &s;ome is punctually perform'd. This brings to my Remembrance the ab&s;urd as well as impious Character a certain Author gives of a Woman of this prepo&s;terous Compo&s;ition of Diver&s;ion and Devotion, or, in his own Words, of Religion and Cards; he repre&s;ents her, in &s;ome Interval of her Game, ju&s;t recollecting it was her Hour of Devotion or Prayer, upon which &s;he ri&s;es in great Precipitation, and de|&s;ires her Neighbour to hold her Cards till &s;he &s;teps and &s;ays her Prayers. To mention this Character, is &s;ufficient to &s;hew the Ab&s;urdity of it. Again, the De&s;cription another Writer gives of a Woman at her Gaming-Table, is e|nough, one would imagine, to make the hard|e&s;t Forehead blu&s;h: And to &s;ay no more, than that it renders her unaimable in the Eyes of rea&s;onable People, one would judge, this would
<PB N="45" REF="006166_0044_1027FD5DA6DCE9E0">
be a great Rea&s;on for her to decline the Diver|&s;ion; but when &s;he is repre&s;ented accu&s;ing her ill Fortune, as &s;he calls it, in Terms of Fury and Ab&s;urdity, the Portrait is horrid and &s;hock|ing, unbecoming a rational Mind, and mo&s;t un|worthy any Per&s;on who profe&s;&s;es Chri&s;tianity. Compare this Character with humble <HI>Mary</HI>'s &s;itting at her Lord's Feet, waiting to hear the gracious Words that proceeded out of his Mouth&mdash;compare it with the Apo&s;tle's De|&s;cription of a Woman profe&s;&s;ing Godline&s;s, who&s;e Mind is adorn'd with <HI>Meekne&s;s, Quietne&s;s and Mode&s;ty</HI>; and &s;ee if you can di&s;cover one &s;imilar Line in the Characters. Again, de&s;cribe a Wo|man dancing at a Ball, and adorn'd with all the Luxury and Pomp of Dre&s;s, tending, accord|ing to the Opinion of a pious Writer, to excite a Pa&s;&s;ion I forbear to name; and Country Dances, &s;ome of 'em, you know, are condemn'd by a Writer much admir'd by the polite and fa&s;hionable Part of the World, who peru&s;e him, I have thought, to very little Purpo&s;e: Exa|mine, I &s;ay, the Characters I have mentioned, and &s;ee if you can ob&s;erve the lea&s;t Trace of Chri&s;tianity in them: In &s;hort, a dancing, gaming, ma&s;querading Chri&s;tian, appears as great a Contradiction, and &s;ounds as har&s;h and uncouth in one's Ears, as a polluted Chri&s;tian; which I have heard a learn'd Per&s;on &s;ay, was no Incon|&s;i&s;tency; however, he fail'd in his Proof, &s;ince I can as &s;oon reconcile Light and Darkne&s;s, CHRIST and Belial, as that a Per&s;on can be both a Sinner and a Saint, at the &s;ame Moment of Time. But, further, tho' &s;ome Recreations,

And therefore he la|ments to &s;ee, that the Power of Godline&s;s, almo&s;t in all Places, was decried and vani&s;hed; the Form and Profe&s;&s;ion of it only remain|ing; that the Spirit and Soul of Religion was, for the mo&s;t Part, gone, and only the out|ward Carca&s;s or Shadow of it left behind!

<PB N="77" REF="006166_0076_1027FDB94CE75C28">
as Superfluity in Apparel, as well as many o|ther In&s;tances of Luxury, appear'd to me in|con&s;i&s;tent with the Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, and the more particular In&s;tructions and Admo|nitions of &s;everal of the Apo&s;tles, I laid a&s;ide &s;everal Things I thought incon&s;i&s;tent with the Profe&s;&s;ion of a Chri&s;tian; and di&s;u&s;ed idle and unmeaning Compliments; and further, being convinced of the Principles of the <HI>People called Quakers,</HI> I joined to that Society. Thus I be|came &s;ingular, and con&s;equently de&s;picable to my Children, and &s;ome of my Acquaintance and Friends; who not only profe&s;s'd a Di&s;like, but a Concern that I &s;hould appear in &s;o con|temptible a Manner, and &s;o very different from what I u&s;ually had done. Here I had a Cro&s;s to bear. What was now to be done! I was certain I had acted with Sincerity, and done, according to the be&s;t of my Under&s;tanding, what I apprehended the Duty of every common Chri&s;tian, <HI>viz.</HI> To part with all Superfluities of Naughtine&s;s, which were now beginning to be burthen&s;ome to me, as I gradually experienced, Old Things pa&s;&s;ing away, and new De&s;ires and Affections to take Place in my Heart. I fre|quented the Meetings of the&s;e People, as I was convinced the Doctrines they taught, and their Mode of Wor&s;hip, were free from Ceremonies and Super&s;tition, and mo&s;t agreeable to the Ob|&s;ervations I had made in reading the &s;acred Wri|tings, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> and what was mo&s;t valuable and worthy Imitation, that the true and genuine Members of this Society, walk con&s;i&s;tently and agreeably to the Rules and Maxims of CHRIST

and his Apo&s;tles. However, to be de&s;pi&s;ed by my Acquaintance, Friends and Children, was a Trial hard to bear: But who&s;oever he be of you, <HI>that taketh not up his Cro&s;s, and hateth not</HI> (comparatively) <HI>Father, Mother, Children,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ays our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, <HI>is not worthy of me, and cannot be my Di&s;ciple.</HI></P>
<P>And, though, in this In&s;tance, I endeavoured to plea&s;e God rather than Men, I'll venture to a&s;&s;ert, that few have a more natural Tenderne&s;s, and affectionate Regard, in both, or all the&s;e Relations than my&s;elf. And, indeed, when the Love of God is received into our Hearts, 'tis &s;o far from le&s;&s;ening or contracting our lawful Affections, that it enlarges our Hearts, in a pe|culiar Manner, to our Relatives and Friends; and excites in us a loving and benevolent Di&s;|po&s;ition towards all Mankind, who&s;e Happine&s;s we entirely wi&s;h: <HI>For if any Man &s;ay, I love God, and hateth his Brother, he is a Liar; for he who loveth not his Brother, whom he hath &s;een, how can he love God, whom he hath not &s;een?</HI> And this Commandment we have from him, <HI>That he who loveth God, will love his Brother al&s;o; and we love God becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us:</HI> Therefore, if God &s;o loved us, we ought to love one another, and do Good to all; but, <HI>more e&s;pecially to the Hou&s;hold of Faith</HI>; with whom we are made one in CHRIST. But further, among many In&s;tances of Self-denial, as I have above remark'd, I found Pride, in Apparel, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be avoided; and tho' Pride, in every Species and Appear|ance, is abominable and odious in the Sight of
<PB N="79" REF="006166_0078_1027FDC063ABAB08">
the Almighty, yet it &s;eems particularly again&s;t this Branch of it, that the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> ex|claims in his third Chapter: And, I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that the Charge of this odious, as well as irrational Pa&s;&s;ion of the Mind, equally affects the Male, as the Female Part of my Species. <HI>But what renders it the more notable, is, that we don't remark, in preceeding Ages, any Prohibi|tion, in the Article of Apparel, ever &s;o much as mention'd; or any Caution given to Men, to avoid Superfluity, or Gaiety, of this Kind</HI>; as if this Folly and Weakne&s;s, was indeed incident and peculiar to Women only. And we may re|mark, from Hi&s;tory, that wi&s;e Men al|ways neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed Gaiety in their Clothes; and, whenever any Vanity of this Sort appeared, tho' in young Men, it was look'd upon with Contempt, and derided by rea&s;onable Men, who con&s;ider'd it as a Mark or Indication of weak Intellects. But however that be, I &s;hall take the Liberty of asking my own Sex, who &s;eem mo&s;t concerned in the Judgements pronounced by the Prophet again&s;t the Pride of Women, their Opinion of the Chapter I have mentioned. After the Prophet had been enu|merating the great Di&s;advantages and Calami|ties the Children or People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had brought upon them&s;elves by their Sin and Di&s;obedience, for which, he tells them, the Lord would a&s;&s;uredly enter into Judgment, by bringing the&s;e Calamities &s;uddenly upon them; he adds, <HI>Moreover, the Lord &s;aith, becau&s;e the Daughters of</HI> Zion <HI>are haughty, and walk with &s;tretched-forth Necks, and wanton Eyes, walking, and
<PB N="80" REF="006166_0079_1027FDC1F49B1638">
mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their Feet: Therefore, in that Day</HI> (the Day of his Judgements) <HI>&s;aith the Lord, I will take away the Bravery of their tinkling Ornaments from about their Feet, and their Cauls, and their round Tires like the Moon, the Chains, and the Bracelets, and the Mufflers, the Bonnets, and the Ornaments of the Legs, and the Head-bands, and the Tablets, and the Ear-rings, the Rings, and No&s;e-jewels, the changeable Suits of Apparel, and Mantles, and the Wimples, and the Cri&s;ping-pins, the Gla&s;&s;es, and the fine Linnen, the Hoods, and the Veils. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that in|&s;tead of &s;weet Smells, there &s;hall be a Stink; in&s;tead of a Girdle, a Rent; in&s;tead of well &s;et Hair, Baldne&s;s; in&s;tead of a Stomacher, a girding with Sackcloth; and Burning, in&s;tead of Beauty.</HI> And hence let us ob&s;erve the Effects of Pride, in Apparel too, which many think &s;o in&s;ignifi|cant; and &s;ome have been &s;o ab&s;urd as to &s;ay, that the Ornaments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> enumerated by the Prophet, were only unlawful to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Women, who po&s;&s;ibly had borrow'd their Fa|&s;hions from the <HI>Heathen,</HI> with whom they were forbid any Sort of Commerce; neither were they to walk after the Cu&s;toms and Man|ners of the <HI>Heathen</HI> Nations.

<P>But hear now what &s;ome of the Chri&s;tian Apo&s;tles enjoin, when they were giving Direc|tions to the Churches of CHRIST, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 9. and which Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> thus notes: <HI>In like Man|ner al&s;o I will that</HI> Chri&s;tian <HI>Women adorn them|&s;elves in mode&s;t Apparel, with Shamefacedne&s;s and Sobriety</HI>; not &s;etting out them&s;elves <HI>with broider'd Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or co&s;tly Ar|ray</HI>; but with that Ornament <HI>which</HI> be&s;t <HI>be|comes Women profe&s;&s;ing Godline&s;s</HI>; that is, <HI>with good Works.</HI> And next the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> in his particular In&s;tructions to Chri&s;tian Women, he thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf; <HI>Who&s;e adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the Hair, and wearing Gold, or putting on of Apparel; but let it be with the hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is in the Sight of God of great Price: For after this Manner, in the old Times, the holy Women al&s;o, who tru&s;t|ed in God, adorned them&s;elves.</HI> And the above
<PB N="82" REF="006166_0081_1027FDC810DF6D70">
cited Author, in his Comment on the Words of both the&s;e Apo&s;tles, gives you his Sen&s;e thus: <HI>It &s;eems evident, that all Attire, which, by the Richne&s;s and Co&s;tline&s;s of it, &s;hews any Pride or Vanity of Spirit, or any Ambition to excel others, is forbid by the Apo&s;tle<HI>'s</HI> Words: All great Con|cernment, Care and Study, to appear in &s;uch At|tire, as if it were our true&s;t Ornament, and that which made us excel, and be more honourable than others: This Vanity and Pride, this E&s;teem of, and Concern for, the&s;e Things, being not well con&s;i&s;tent with Sobriety, and much le&s;s with the</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion of true Godline&s;s. <HI>And here</HI> (conti|nues he) <HI>'tis worthy to be noted by the Women, that this Precept ought not to be &s;lighted by them, as of little Moment, &s;eeing it is &s;o carefully in|culcated by the two chief Apo&s;tles of the Jews and Gentiles, St.</HI> Peter <HI>and St.</HI> Paul. <HI>And the contrary is repre&s;ented as a Practice oppo&s;ite to Godline&s;s:</HI> And he &s;ubjoins; <HI>Let them e&s;pecially remark the Character here given of a Chri&s;tian Woman,</HI> viz. <HI>That &s;he is one who does not only profe&s;s and declare, that &s;he &s;erves and wor&s;hips God; but al&s;o doth &s;hew forth Godline&s;s in her Life and Conver&s;ation. And let the Men note hence, that if it be &s;o unbecoming a Chri&s;tian Wo|man to be thus concern'd in adorning and tricking up her Body, it mu&s;t be much more unbecoming a Chri&s;tian Man to put on &s;uch Attire, which makes him truly de&s;erve the Name of</HI> Fop. And next let us hear the Opinion of one of the Antients, <HI>viz, Clemens</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI>; he tells us, <HI>That Women, who wear Gold, and plait the Hair, have not the Image of God in the inward Man;
<PB N="83" REF="006166_0082_1027FDCC0E057270">
and that the apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions forbid Women to wear exqui&s;ite Garments, which were fitted to deceive, or Gold Rings,</HI> &amp;c. And <HI>Jamblicus,</HI> in the Life of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>That no free Wo|men wore Gold, but lewd Women only.</HI> Hence you may ob&s;erve, that the People called <HI>Qua|kers,</HI> are not &s;ingular in the Con&s;truction they put on, or Sen&s;e they con&s;ider the Apo&s;tle's Words in, in the Article of Apparel; and that our Particularity in this Matter does not pro|ceed from Whim, Caprice or Fancy, or any Affectation of being &s;ingular; but from a Con|viction in our own Under&s;tanding, that Super|fluity and Luxury, which has its Ri&s;e from Pride, is incon&s;i&s;tent and contrary to the hum|ble, lowly, unambitious Temper and Spirit, of Chri&s;tianity. One Argument &s;ome have made u&s;e of to &s;upport the Vanity of gay and co&s;tly Clothing, was this; That the Pride was not in the Clothes, but in the Heart; An A&s;&s;ertion I have greatly prov'd true by my own Expe|rience. I could not imagine there could be any moral or inherent Evil in a Piece of gay Silk; for I know full well, that Pride proceeds from a vain and ambitious Heart; and that if it had not its Re&s;idence, and Seat there, it would not appear in the Habit or Garb. But tho' &s;ome perhaps may allow me to be acquainted with, and therefore a Judge of my own Heart; yet, wou'd it not border upon Uncharitablene&s;s, to alledge that all Per&s;ons who wear gay Clothing, are con&s;equently proud and ambitious? I an&s;wer; Tho' it may not be &s;afe to judge in every Ca&s;e according to the Sight of the Eye, yet our

Lord &s;eems to allow us the Evidence of our Sen&s;es pretty generally. <HI>Every Tree,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is known by its Fruit. Of Thorns Men do not ga|ther Figs, nor off a Bramble-bu&s;h Grapes.</HI> And then gives us the following Mark or Criterion to judge by, <HI>Ye &s;hall know them by their Fruits.</HI> Thus when I &s;ee Fruits of the &s;ame Kind pro|duced by others, which I certainly know pro|ceeded from the bitter Root of Pride in my own Heart, I do not think it an uncharitable, but a natural and rational Conclu&s;ion, that they &s;pring from the like evil Root in others. <HI>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, neither can a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit. A good Man, out of the good Trea&s;ure of his Heart, bringeth forth that which is good; but an evil Man, out of the evil Trea&s;ure of his Heart, bringeth forth that which is evil.</HI> I have heard it objected, that Per&s;ons, who have always been accu&s;tomed to Finery from their Infancy, are not commonly proud of it; it becomes there|by &s;o familiar to them, that they have not &s;uch high Thoughts of them&s;elves when gaily attir'd as many imagine; neither value Dre&s;s and &s;plendid Equipages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at &s;o high a Rate, as tho&s;e do to whom they have not been &s;o habitual; this I have thought may be partly true; but notwith&s;tanding I have con&s;ider'd, that tho' the&s;e Things are habitual and familiar to many, yet People of this Character are not &s;o ignorant, as not to be &s;en&s;ible that they are re&s;pected and courted according to the Appear|ance they make in the World; and &s;hould any One propo&s;e to &s;uch to lay a&s;ide their Splen|dor

<P>Part of a Conver&s;ation I happen'd to have with a fa&s;hionable Woman in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> will &s;erve to confirm what I have ob&s;erv'd. She a&s;&s;erted &s;he was free from Pride, tho' &s;he did adorn her&s;elf in a gay and &s;plendid Manner. I ask'd her if &s;he could be as well &s;atisfied and con|tent in a plain Dre&s;s, and Stuff or Woollen Gown, as with the gay Silks &s;he u&s;ually wore? She an|&s;wer'd yes. I queried why &s;he then dre&s;&s;ed &s;o gay? She an&s;wer'd, that &s;he might appear agreeable to others. I ask'd her why &s;he was &s;o much con|cern'd to plea&s;e others with her fine Clothes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> She &s;aid, it was lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould be de&s;pi&s;ed for the Meane&s;s of her Appearance. I ask'd her whence proceeded that Fear? Here, I think, &s;he was &s;ilent, being reduced to an Extremity, which proved the Source of her Vanity to be nothing le&s;s than Pride, in &s;pight of all her boa&s;ted Humility. I have often thought, our Fondne&s;s for Trifles, Pomp, Shew and Noi&s;e,
<PB N="86" REF="006166_0085_1027FDD0F123C9C8">
may be attributed to Incon&s;ideration: For did we reflect, examine and compare Things, we &s;hould certainly make very different Deductions, Conclu&s;ions, and E&s;timations, from what the Generality of Mankind are wont to do. And I am certain, from our Ignorance of Divine and Heavenly Things, proceeds our Fondne&s;s and inordinate De&s;ires for &s;en&s;ual and earthly Plea|&s;ures and Enjoyments. And indeed &s;ince I have thought at all, I mean to any good Pur|po&s;e, I have been amazed at my own Stupi|dity and Folly, when I have con&s;ider'd and re|collected how anxious I had formerly been till I was in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this gay Silk, and the other fine Lace; and I have blu&s;hed with an holy Shame, when I reflected how I had &s;ometimes doated on a Ribbon, or any other Toy or Bau|ble, that had but the Title of <HI>new-fa&s;hion'd</HI> annex'd to it! One common Argument for Su|perfluity and Luxury of all Kinds, is, that it encourages and &s;upports Trade; and that the Bread and Sub&s;i&s;tence of Thou&s;ands depend on new Fa&s;hions: But tho&s;e who offer this Rea&s;on, do not con&s;ider how many, on the contrary, are ruin'd and undone by contributing to what is alledged the Support of Trade; this being &s;o manife&s;t, e&s;pecially in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that it needs no other Proof but the Evidence of our Eyes, if we will but look round and con&s;ider how many Families are reduced to Poverty, Wretchedne&s;s and Mi&s;ery, from this very Source Pride, from whence &s;prings Luxury, in all its hideous Forms and Shapes. The Di&s;order, as a late Writer ob&s;erves, is become <HI>almo&s;t epidemical,</HI>

as the inferior Cla&s;s of People endeavour all in their Power to appear as grand and fa&s;hionable as their Superiors. And when I have con&s;ider'd, how u&s;ual it is for the lower Part of Mankind to be &s;way'd by the Example of the higher, I have thought it greatly behoved People of Rank and Condition to exhibit Patterns of Humility, Temperance, Sobriety and Moderation, with every other Chri&s;tian Virtue, to their Inferiors. But I have heard it objected, that co&s;tly and &s;plendid Apparel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to make and &s;upport a proper Di&s;tinction between Per&s;ons of high and low Degree. The Argument I have thought weak, and unworthy to be offer'd by a Chri&s;tian, as I am of Opinion, every rea&s;on|able Per&s;on will grant that Piety and Virtue (not Gold and tin&s;el Ornaments) ought to di&s;|tingui&s;h and render truly honourable the high|er Rank of People. Be&s;ides, it is evident, that the&s;e Di&s;tinctions are not kept up and maintain'd by co&s;tly Attire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for we may daily ob&s;erve, that Per&s;ons of the lowe&s;t Rank, with Re&s;pect to their Offices and Employments, are often|times very wealthy; and the&s;e adorn them|&s;elves in as pompous a Manner, and have as grand Hou&s;es, Furniture, Equipages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as tho&s;e who are greatly &s;uperior to them in other Re&s;pects.</P>
<P>But allowing many Things the Title of Su|perfluity and Luxury, and therefore unlawful to be u&s;ed by Chri&s;tians; it has been queried how are all the&s;e Fa&s;hion-mongers, who are &s;upported by making and vending Things of this Nature, to be provided for, if they &s;hould

Ones: But if Men will not hear, the Con&s;equence as naturally follows, as in any other Ca&s;e, God remaining invariably the &s;ame, and without the lea&s;t Shadow of turning.</HI> I &s;hall now produce another Te&s;timony to the Truth of the Opera|tion of God's Spirit in Man, which the Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray</HI> gives us in the following Words; <HI>By Scripture 'tis certain that the Spirit of God dwells in us; that it acts there, that it prays there continually, that it groans there, de|&s;ires there; that it asketh for us, what we know not how to ask for our&s;elves; that it excites us, animates us, &s;peaks to us in Silence, &s;ugge&s;ts all Truth to us, and unites us to it&s;elf, that we be|come one Spirit with God: This is what Scripture teacheth; this is what the Doctors who are far|the&s;t off of inward Life, cannot but acknowledge: And yet, notwith&s;tanding their Principles, we al|ways &s;ee by their Practice, that they &s;uppo&s;e the outward written Law, or; at mo&s;t, a Light drawn from Scripture and Rea&s;on, to be what enlightens us inwardly; and that it is not our Rea&s;on after|wards which acts of it&s;elf by that In&s;truction. The&s;e Men &s;et not enough by the inward Teacher, the Holy Spirit, who does all in us; he is the Soul of our Souls; we cannot frame a Thought, or create a De&s;ire, but through him. Alas! how great is our Blindne&s;s! We make account as if we were by our&s;elves in this inward Sanctuary; but, on the contrary, God is there more nearly than we our&s;elves are. Perhaps you will &s;ay to me, What then, are we all in&s;pired? Yes, without Doubt; but not as the Prophets and Apo&s;tles were. With|out the actual In&s;piration of the Spirit of Grace,
<PB N="109" REF="006166_0108_1027FE12A410F0D0">
we can neither believe, will, nor do any Good. We are therefore always in&s;pired; but we &s;tifle this In&s;piration continually. God cea&s;es not to &s;peak; but the Noi&s;e and Hurry of Things with|out, and our Pa&s;&s;ions within, deafen us, and hin|der us from hearing Him. We mu&s;t &s;ilence every Creature, and our&s;elves too, to hear in a profound Stillne&s;s of Soul, the inexpre&s;&s;ible Voice of Chri&s;t, the Bridegroom of our Souls. We mu&s;t li&s;ten dili|gently; for 'tis a very &s;till and &s;oft Voice, which is not to be heard, but by &s;uch as hearken to no|thing el&s;e. O how &s;eldom is the Soul &s;ilent enough to let God &s;peak! The lea&s;t whi&s;per of our vain De&s;ires, or of Self-love, attentive on Self, con|founds all the Words of the Spirit of God. We hear plainly what he &s;peaks, and that he asks for &s;omething; but we don't perceive what it is; and very often we are contented not to under&s;tand it. The lea&s;t Re&s;erve, the lea&s;t Regard for Self, the lea&s;t Fear of under&s;tanding too plainly, that God asks for more than we care to give Him, di&s;turbs this inward Voice. Shall we wonder then that &s;o many, and even pious Per&s;ons, but full of a|mu&s;ing Thoughts, vain De&s;ires, worldly Wi&s;dom, and Confidence in their own Virtues, can't hear it; but take this inward Voice to be a Chimera of Fanaticks! Alas, what do they mean by &s;uch &s;cornful Language? To what Purpo&s;e would the outward Expre&s;&s;ions of Teachers be, and even of the Scriptures them&s;elves, if it were not for the inward Voice of the Holy Spirit; which gives the other all its Efficacy. The outward Words of the Go&s;pel it&s;elf without this living, efficacious Word within, would be but an empty Sound. 'Tis

the Letter that killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life. O eternal and All-powerful Word of the Father! 'tis thou who &s;peake&s;t in the very Bottom of our Souls. The Words that proceeded out of the Mouth of our Saviour, when upon Earth, had not been productive of &s;o much Virtue, and &s;o great Fruits, but becau&s;e they were animated by this Word of Life, which is the Word him&s;elf. This made</HI> Peter <HI>&s;ay,</HI> Lord, to whom &s;hall we go? Thou ha&s;t the Words of eternal Life! <HI>There|fore it is not the exterior Law or Rule of the Go&s;pel, which God lets us &s;ee by the Light of Rea|&s;on and Scripture; 'tis his Spirit that &s;peaks, that teaches, that operates in, and animates us; &s;o 'tis the Spirit that worketh in us, both to will and to do what is good; as 'tis our Soul that animates our Body, and regulates its Motions: 'Tis certain therefore that we are all in&s;pir'd continually; that we live not the Life of Grace, but in Pro|portion as we partake of this inward In&s;piration. The&s;e Po&s;itions and Principles being laid, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that God &s;peaks continually in us: He &s;peaks in harden'd and impenitent Sinners; but they being &s;tunn'd, as it were, by the Noi&s;e of the World, and their Pa&s;&s;ions, cannot hear his Voice; 'tis to them a Tale or Fiction: He &s;peaks in penitent Sinners, they feel a Remor&s;e of Con|&s;cience, and that Remor&s;e is the Voice of God, which reproaches them inwardly for their Sins: When the&s;e Sinners are effectually reached and &s;mitten, they find no Difficulty in under&s;tanding this &s;ecret Voice; for 'tis that which &s;mites them &s;o &s;harply; 'tis in them the</HI> Two-edged Sword <HI>St.</HI> Paul <HI>&s;peaks of,</HI> which divides a&s;under Soul

many able Pens have been employed, to eradi|cate it, by Rea&s;ons and Arguments, &s;ufficient abundantly to convince us of its hurtful Nature, and give as a ju&s;t Abhorrence of it; as an In|jury done to our Neighbour &s;eldom fails to re|coil upon our &s;elves at one Time or other; for he that diggeth a Pit &s;hall fall into it, and he that rolleth a Stone, it &s;hall return upon him. And as I have noted, this Vice has been expo&s;ed to the World long ago, in its hideous Forms and cruel Con&s;equences, I don't here pre&s;ume to think my&s;elf capable of painting it in more gloomy and di&s;agreeable Shapes than others have done. What I would remark is, That it is to be feared many don't peru&s;e carefully the Scriptures, and other Books, on the Sub|ject of Moral, as well as Chri&s;tian Virtues; or at lea&s;t do not &s;ufficiently con&s;ider them; for did we but rightly and ju&s;tly reflect on this Precept of CHRIST's, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neigh|bour as thy&s;elf,</HI> One would think it might be &s;ufficient to prevent the Mouth of Envy, Ma|lice, Infamy and Detraction, from ever being open'd; and were there but Room for this Re|flection in any Interval of &s;uch Conver&s;ation, how wou'd it &s;ilence all Uncharitablene&s;s! CHRIST mentions our <HI>Love to God</HI> in the fir&s;t Place, and in the &s;uperlative Degree; and in the next, <HI>Love</HI> (or Charity) <HI>to our Neighbour, as the two</HI> (mo&s;t material) <HI>Commandments</HI> (or Points) <HI>on which depends the Law and the Pro|phets.</HI> And he has left us this Injunction, which is &s;tiled <HI>the golden Rule,</HI> and ought to be an inviolable One, "What&s;oever ye would
<PB N="115" REF="006166_0114_1027FE253B649700">
that Men &s;hould do unto you, do you even the &s;ame to them." And on another Occa&s;ion he adds, "A new Commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another." And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> recommends to the <HI>Romans</HI> the accompli&s;h|ing this Commandment in the&s;e Words "Owe no Man any Thing, but to love one another; Love worketh no Ill to his Neighbour; therefore Love is the fulfilling of the Law." And after enumerating the Laws of the &s;econd Table, he &s;ubjoins, "If there be any other Command|ment, it is briefly comprehended in this, Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy&s;elf." But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not con&s;umed one of another." The Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> tells the Believers, if they ful|fill'd the royal Law according to the Scripture, "Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy&s;elf, ye do well." And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> giving the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Galatians</HI> a Catalogue of the Fruits or Sins of the Fle&s;h, among others he mentions "Backbiting, Envy, Whi&s;pering, Malice, Emulation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" And he exhorts the <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> to put away "all Bitterne&s;s, Wrath, Clamour and Evil-&s;peaking, with all Malice; and be ye kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, as God for CHRIST's Sake hath forgiven you." And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> dehorting Chri&s;tians from the Breach of Charity, &s;peaks after this Manner; "Where|fore laying a&s;ide all Malice, Guile, Hypocri&s;y, Envy, and all Evil-&s;peaking, by which you will become as new born Babes (innocent and pure) fitted to recive (or de&s;ire) the &s;incere Milk
<PB N="116" REF="006166_0115_1027FE280BA81D98">
of the Word, that ye may grow thereby." And next let us ob&s;erve, how that St. <HI>Paul</HI> exalts this Love to God, and Charity (or Love) to our Neighbour, above all other Gifts and Virtues: "Tho' I &s;peak with the Tongue of Men or Angels, and have not Charity, I am become as &s;ounding Bra&s;s, or a tinkling Cym|bal. Tho' I have the Gift of Prophecy, and under&s;tand all My&s;teries and Knowledge; tho' I have Faith, &s;o as to remove Mountains, and have not Charity, I am nothing. And tho' I be&s;tow all my Goods to feed the Poor, and tho' I give my Body to be burned and have not Charity (if I don't give and &s;uffer from this Principal of Love to God and my Neighbour) it profiteth me nothing. Charity or Love &s;uf|fereth long, and is kind; Charity envieth not (the Happine&s;s of another) Charity vaunteth not it&s;elf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it&s;elf un&s;eemly, &s;eeketh not her own (Honour or Reputation) is not ea&s;ily provoked, thinketh no Evil, rejoiceth not in Iniquity, but re|joiceth in the Truth, or (when any act agreea|ble to the Go&s;pel of CHRIST) beareth all Things, believeth all Things, (all the Good it hears, or can have any charitable Grounds to think of others) hopeth all Things (that if our Neigh|bour is bad he may mend) endureth all Things (patiently) as all Things work together for Good to them that love God. This Charity never faileth; but whether there be Prophecies they &s;hall fail; whether there be Tongues they &s;hall cea&s;e; whether there be Knowledge it &s;hall vani&s;h away. And now abideth Faith,
<PB N="117" REF="006166_0116_1027FE2993437138">
Hope and Charity, but the greate&s;t of the&s;e is Charity," as it will continue when Faith &s;hall end in Vi&s;ion, and Hope in Enjoyment. And now permit me to recommend to you a &s;erious Peru&s;al of the&s;e, as well as other Pa&s;&s;ages of the Holy Records, which were written for our Learning and In&s;truction: And among&s;t many which I might mention, who has wrote again&s;t the Sin of Detraction, there is one in the Collection called <HI>The Lady</HI>'s <HI>Library,</HI> worth peru&s;ing, as the Arguments &s;eem founded on Chri&s;tian Principles and Doctrines, and the Rea|&s;oning obvious and convincing. But &s;uffer me now, without Offence, to mention a Thought I have often had, when I have been reflecting on this Fault in both Sexes. As I endeavour to cheri&s;h a more charitable Opinion of Man|kind, than to think any Per&s;on can delight in Evil &s;imply as Evil; and I would fain hope few are of &s;o cruel a Di&s;po&s;ition, as to receive a Plea&s;ure in hearing the Errors and Mi&s;carriages of their Neighbours related. And if any be guilty of the &s;ame Fault, or any other, our Brother may be charged with, the Company of others in Evil, will by no Means extenuate our Crime, or render &s;uch le&s;s culpable in the Sight of God, or le&s;s odious to good Men: But, on the contrary (if I may be allow'd the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion) the Confederacy again&s;t Heaven is the more &s;trengthen'd by the Number of its Enemies; yet tho' they join Hand in Hand, they &s;hall not go unpuni&s;hed: However, I have put the Conduct of People of this Character on a more charitable and favourable Bottom; for I
<PB N="118" REF="006166_0117_1027FE2C618CC2A8">
have con&s;ider'd, that the&s;e &s;ort of Conver&s;a|tions, or rather Con&s;piracies, again&s;t our Neigh|bour's Fame, proceed from a Defect of that &s;olid Nouri&s;hment the Author I have before cited &s;eems to recommend. And I have &s;ome|times thought, that it is our Ignorance of other Matters, and better Subjects, which occa&s;ions our Neighbour's Conduct to be &s;o frequently the Topick of our Conver&s;ations; but I wou'd not be here under&s;tood to call in que&s;tion the Capacities of either Sex, and wou'd only de&s;ire the Liberty of giving a Caution again&s;t the Mi&s;application of your Talent or Talents. This appears to me to be the Fault, People's employing their Faculties &s;o much, not only on vain, and trifling Subjects, but frequently on pernicious and hurtful Things, &s;o that they have no Room nor Lei&s;ure to attend to more u&s;eful and important Subjects; and as I have &s;aid, that tho' we may not be chargeable with the &s;ame Fault our Neighbour may be guilty of, yet the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, "All Man|kind have &s;inned, and fallen &s;hort of the Fa|vour of God," and therefore all who have not yet &s;incerely repented and amended their Ways, have need of Repentance and Forgivene&s;s. But if any commit an Evil, how are Chri&s;tians to act in &s;uch a Circum&s;tance? Are we to ex|po&s;e, blacken and defame our Brother, or to re|joice in his Mi&s;carriage? No &s;urely; the Go&s;pel of CHRIST and his Mini&s;ters teach other Things.</P>

con&s;idering, lea&s;t thou thy&s;elf be al&s;o tempted," let his Mi&s;carriage excite our Com|pa&s;&s;ion towards him, and Caution towards our|&s;elves; and bear ye one another's Burthen's, and &s;o fulfil the law of Chri&s;t, "Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy&s;elf;" and when|ever we call in Que&s;tion our Neighbour's Con|duct, let us remember we are fir&s;t to be &s;pi|ritual our&s;elves, walking in all God's Com|mandments blamele&s;s: And agreeable to the Doctrines and Principles of Chri&s;t, let us fir&s;t pull the Beam out of our own Eye, and then &s;hall we &s;ee clearly to take the Mote from our Brother's. And when we are converted then &s;hall we be fitted to &s;trengthen our Brethren: Thus the royal P&s;almi&s;t petitions the Almighty, "Create in me a clean heart O God, and renew a right Spirit within me: Then will I teach Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors thy ways, and Sinners &s;hall be converted to Thee."</P>
<P>I &s;hall now mention another particular Evil, not only as I find it greatly blam'd by others, but as it has often been Subject of Concern to me when I have ob&s;erv'd this unnatural Con|duct, which relates only to the Female Part of the World, &s;o ju&s;tly chargeable on them: But which I would charitably hope they have not yet many of them &s;een, or at lea&s;t reflect|ed on the great Mi&s;chief it produces, both to them&s;elves, and their Offspring. The Fault I mean, is Neglect of Duty, and natural Obliga|tion to our helple&s;s Infants, which is &s;o obvi|ous at their fir&s;t Appearance in Life, when we de|ny them that Nouri&s;hment Nature has provided
<PB N="120" REF="006166_0119_1027FE33865CE800">
for them, and by framing &s;ome in&s;ignificant Excu&s;e, for&s;ake and leave them to others. This inhumane Treatment of our tender little Ones, I can't help thinking has its Foundation in Pride Natural Affection to our Offspring &s;eems blended with our very Con&s;titution; and it appears to me we mu&s;t u&s;e uncommon Vio|lence to &s;eparate it from our Make. But be|hold the Effects of Pride! what Mi&s;chief is there that it is not productive of! Even a few Weeks after our tender Babe beholds the Light, le&s;t it &s;hould occa&s;ion us &s;ome extraordinary Trouble and Care, or prevent &s;ome little Deli|cacy in our Shape or Dre&s;s, or detain us from making unedifying and impertinent Vi&s;its, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we con&s;ign the poor Innocent into the Hands of a Stranger, to be fo&s;ter'd by Women, often|times, of &s;avage Tempers, and vile Affections, which &s;ome are of Opinion the Infant imbibes with its Milk; tho' I can't conceive this, as I apprehend we are not Sinners by Con&s;titution, but Corruption. However, it is manife&s;t, and often happens, that the Child imbibes an un|whole&s;ome Con&s;titution from its Nur&s;e: And, 'tis the Opinion of &s;ome, that the Death of many an Infant (in other Places at lea&s;t) may be chargeable on their Parents, on this Score; as al&s;o when the Nur&s;e proves carele&s;s and neg|ligent in her Office; and that this has been frequently the Ca&s;e, few will deny: For how can we rea&s;onably expect that a Stranger &s;hou'd take that due and tender Care, and faithfully di&s;|charge &s;o trouble&s;ome an Office, which a Parent, &s;uppos'd to have a natural Engagement for her
<PB N="121" REF="006166_0120_1027FE350E660130">
Infant, declines and refu&s;es, for this very Rea|&s;on to take upon her. I, who am a Parent, have been fill'd with A&s;toni&s;hment at the Pa|rent, and Compa&s;&s;ion towards the Child, when I have beheld the delicate Mother &s;it un|concern'd and unrelenting, at the Time her little Offspring has been uttering its tender Complaints, and, as it were, petitioning the obdurate Parent with its little eloquence of Tears for its own Support, provided by Nature, without her Care or Trouble. Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> in &s;ome Ob&s;ervations on Things natural, to ex|plain and illu&s;trate his Subject, has the&s;e Words;
<Q>'Tis natural, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> for a Woman to &s;uckle her Infant, becau&s;e Nature has furni&s;h'd her with proper and &s;uitable Means of Nouri&s;h|ment for that Purpo&s;e.</Q>
But had that Au|thor lived till this Day; he had po&s;&s;ibly been told Nature had changed her Order, and ge|nerally with-held and deny'd the common Means. It has often been Subject of Reflection to me, when I have ob&s;erved that Women pretend they are &s;o univer&s;ally di&s;abled, that they are incapable of taking upon them this tender Of|fice, and di&s;charging the natural Obligation of Suckling their Children. The general Plea is, want of Milk, or Tenderne&s;s of Con&s;titution, which renders them unfit to take upon them &s;o trouble&s;ome an Office: But as often as I have ob&s;erved, examin'd, and traced &s;uch Pretences and Excu&s;es for this Cruelty, I have found (except in &s;ome few In&s;tances) they ab&s;olutely center in Pride and Self-love. But I only pro|po&s;e by this &s;hort remark, to remind &s;ome,
<PB N="122" REF="006166_0121_1027FE38104E5100">

However, he (as well as others) does not propo&s;e Impo&s;&s;i|bilities to any; On the contrary, he goes far in admitting real and rea&s;onable Pleas and Excu&s;es; but where none of the&s;e appear, he is of Opi|nion, 'tis every Woman's indi&s;pen&s;ible Obliga|tion to nouri&s;h her Infant at her own Brea&s;t.

<P>I don't purpo&s;e to &s;ay much on this Subject; yet think proper to offer a few things to your Con&s;ideration, which tho' they may perhaps appear trifling to &s;ome at fir&s;t Sight, yet I have &s;ometimes thought them of greater Con&s;equence, than I apprehend many others do. That Errors in the fir&s;t Principles of Education (as well as
<PB N="125" REF="006166_0124_1027FE408E5B2FA8">
in other Ca&s;es) are dangerous and pernicious, is a received Maxim; for if we &s;et out with wrong Means to obtain a de&s;ired End; we have not only lo&s;t our Time, but with great Difficul|ty and Labour mu&s;t unlearn our fir&s;t Rules and Le&s;&s;ons. Upon reflecting on the Appearances of Anger and Re&s;entment, which we find &s;o early and &s;o often glow in the little tender Brea&s;ts of Infants, and the early Propen&s;ities we ob&s;erve in them to Pride, and a Fondne&s;s for Trifles; it has appeared to me, they may be often attributed to the ill Example of Parents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Errors in their Management from their Infancy, as young Children we know common|ly imitate and act from the Example of their Parents, or tho&s;e concern'd in the Care and E|ducation of them. To &s;ay little of the &s;uper|fluous Ornaments of Lace, Lace-work, and Ribbands, which the Infant is adorn'd with, as &s;oon as it comes into the World, as well to plea&s;e and gratify the Mother's and Nur&s;e's Vanity, as that it may be admir'd by the for|mal and ceremonious Vi&s;itors; as &s;oon as the In|fant is capable of the lea&s;t Notice, it is imme|diately pre&s;ented with a Number of fooli&s;h Toys, which, tho' &s;ome, &s;uitably cho&s;en, may be pro|per to give them an Idea of natural Things, yet I have thought there are many Trifles pre|&s;ented and recommended to them as Things of Value and Worth, which lead them afterwards to entertain a Fondne&s;s for Vanities and Toys, that are more expen&s;ive and hurtful. By this Time, &s;ome little Dawning of Rea&s;on begins to appear in the Child, Care is taken to inculcate
<PB N="126" REF="006166_0125_1027FE43A1E7A448">
the Principles of Anger and Malice, Re&s;entment and Revenge, as the Child is in&s;tructed to re|ceive every little Contradiction, as an Injury or Affront, which he is to revenge, by giving the Nur&s;e the Blow to execute on the Of|fender. Next comes in Cour&s;e, to amu&s;e the Child, a String of idle ab&s;urd Sonnets and Bal|lads, which, as &s;oon as it is li&s;ping Tongue is able to form Words, it is taught to repeat. The next In&s;truction is, in a Catalogue of vain, amu|&s;ing Stories, a Relation of Fairy Tales, Hi&s;to|ries of Giants, Tom Thumbs, and &s;uch like Stuff, are the young and tender Brains and Ca|pacities of Infants &s;tor'd with; as proper Rudi|ments to fit them for, and introduce more in|genious Lies and Romances. The next Thing Children are early in&s;tructed in, is Rule and Au|thority, by teaching, and allowing them a Supe|riority over Servants. A Servant tho' never &s;o judicious and capable of knowing what is fit and convenient for a Child, is neverthele&s;s re|&s;trained by many Parents from keeping Children in Subjection and Order, or cro&s;&s;ing and di&s;ap|pointing their Will in any Circum&s;tance; this manife&s;tly teacher the Child a Le&s;&s;on of Self-will, which many never unlearn all their Lives after. The next Cruelty we are guilty of to our Children, is Flattery (at the &s;ame Time by Example or Precept teaching them many little and mean Artifices and equivocal Turns, un|worthy a rational and generous, to &s;ay nothing of a Chri&s;tian Mind) this is commonly practi&s;ed both by Parents and Servants, by whom Chil|dren are in&s;tructed, when adorn'd with all the

Pomp and Vanity within the Parent's Reach, to &s;et an high Value and E&s;timation on them|&s;elves, on the Score of their fine Clothes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or the Perfections of their Bodies, and at the &s;ame time they are taught to de&s;pi&s;e others, by per&s;wading them they are both finer and hand|&s;omer than &s;ome others. And now to fini&s;h and compleat a modern Education, it requires the fol|lowing Accompli&s;hments, <HI>viz.</HI> To be expert in Dre&s;s and Dancing, Ombre or Gaming in general, to be able to make judicious Remarks on Opera Airs, and &s;tage Plays, and to repeat much of the Ribaldry and Prophanity they learn from thence, and reading Romances and other perni|cious Books. Add to all this the Art of Vi|&s;iting, where after tho&s;e pre&s;ent are much flat|ter'd and complimented; the Ab&s;ent, on the contrary, are as ungenerou&s;ly dealt with, and &s;everely handled. But with re&s;pect to the re|ligious Education of Children, we do not find many Parents employ much of their Time in giving Children an Idea of the Supreme Being, &s;uitable to their Under&s;tanding; and as far as their little Capacities will admit, in&s;truct and incul|cate the Principles of moral and Chri&s;tian Du|ties: On the contrary, the Generality of Pa|rents, &s;eem to think they have &s;ufficiently di&s;|charged their religious Duty, if they are care|ful their Children are taught to repeat the Du|ties the Catehi&s;m contains; and in the &s;ame Manner &s;ay over a Set of Words, entitled, <HI>Pray|ers for Children</HI>; which they neither do nor can under&s;tand, at the Age they are taught them; and which I can't but con&s;ider as great Impiety

and Irreverence in both Parents and School-mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, when they teach Children to &s;peak Words, they do not under&s;tand, to an Infinite Being; of which they, at the Time they are taught them, can have no competent Know|ledge, &s;o as to enable them to addre&s;s Him at all; much le&s;s in the Terms commonly put into their Mouths.

And what is the Rea&s;on, that we are &s;o much outdone by the Churches aforementioned; we can't conclude,
<PB N="136" REF="006166_0135_1027FE614B226720">
that the Kingdom of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>that then appear'd in Power, did, as the Sun in the Firmament &s;ome|times doth, &s;how it&s;elf in a Morning, and be no more &s;een all the Day; for the Kingdom of Chri&s;t is an everla&s;ting Kingdom, and his new Covenant an everla&s;ting Covenant. Neither can we conclude, that God hath withdrawn Him&s;elf from the Chil|dren of Men, for he never for&s;akes us, unle&s;s we for|&s;ake him, as the Clouds hinder, that we cannot at all Times of the Day &s;ee the Brightne&s;s of the Sun; &s;o Iniquity hinders, that we do not remain &s;en&s;ible of the Pre&s;ence of God. The Apo&s;tle fore&s;aw, that there would be a falling away from the Grace in which many of the primitive Chri&s;tians were e&s;tabli&s;h|ed; and it &s;oon after his Decea&s;e came to pa&s;s. But we &s;ay, that the dark Night of Apo&s;tacy is over, and we live in Go&s;pel-days again; if &s;o, where are the Fruits? We may, I confe&s;s, hear Go&s;pel-Words; but where is the Go&s;pel Power, by which Believers come to be Sons of God; to bear his Image in Righteou&s;ne&s;s? Why are not we, call'd Chri&s;tians, grown to the Stature of them that were the Children of</HI> Heathens? <HI>The Rea&s;on to me is this, we have not built upon the &s;ame Foundation: Tho&s;e built on the &s;ure Rock, and living Founda|tion, on CHRIST; as he, in all Ages, was, and &s;till is, in &s;piritual Appearance, the Light of the World, and the Life of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and taking his Eternal Spirit in them&s;elves for their Guide, turn'd from what&s;oever they were reproved for. Thus their &s;inful De&s;ires came to be mortified; and &s;uch as were carnal came to be &s;piritual; and this made them a peculiar People. Did we walk in their Foot&s;teps, we might ri&s;e to their Attain|ments;
<PB N="137" REF="006166_0136_1027FE62DA066250">
but if we build on Words, and outward Services, without Spirit and Life, we can never ri&s;e. For as</HI> Paul <HI>&s;aid in another Ca&s;e,</HI> If I &s;peak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, and have not Charity, I am become as &s;ounding Bra&s;s, <HI>&amp;c. So I &s;ay in this Ca&s;e, if we hear Men and Angels; if we could live continually under the Sound of good Words, if we have no Regard to that inward Light, which di&s;covers Evil, and gives Power to turn from it, we can never mor|tify Sin, clean&s;e our Souls, and become an holy People. The Work of Sanctification is inward in the Heart, and to be effected by inward Means: Nothing but inward Light can expel inward Dark|ne&s;s: Since Men fondly per&s;uade them&s;elves, that tho' they &s;ow Tares, they &s;hall reap Wheat; tho' they go down into the Grave Sinners, they &s;hall ri&s;e Saints; and attain in another World what primitive Chri&s;tians attain'd in this: Their Conver&s;ation hath not been in Heaven; but in Earth: They have walked in Darkne&s;s, and not in the Light; the God of this World hath been &s;erved, and not the God of Heaven.</HI> And not|with&s;tanding this is the unhappy and deplora|ble Circum&s;tance of many of the Profe&s;&s;ors of this Age; yet from the Mouths of &s;uch, how frequently do we hear Exclamations and Com|plaints, again&s;t the daily Growth of <HI>Infidelity</HI> and <HI>Dei&s;m!</HI> never &s;o much as imagining that they are any way acce&s;&s;ary or in&s;trumental to this Mi&s;chief; yet one great Cau&s;e thereof, I take to be, the irregular and unholy Lives of Profe&s;&s;ors. And till &s;uch can be per&s;waded, that a con&s;i&s;tent Practice with the Religion they

profe&s;s, is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, to recommend the Chri&s;tian Religion; and till they produce the mo&s;t convincing and prevailing Argument, <HI>Example,</HI> how can they hope or expect to be credited by this Infidel Race, which &s;o much abounds; as every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the Difficulty of enforcing a Precept (tho' never &s;o laudable in it&s;elf) in Words, which in our Lives and Practices we notoriou&s;ly deny? There|fore the only Expedient that I know of, to &s;top the Mouths of Unbelievers, will be, <HI>To &s;hew forth your good Conver&s;ation in CHRIST JESUS, coupled with the Fear of God</HI>; to <HI>Let your Light &s;o &s;hine before Men, that they &s;eeing your good Works, may glorify God, and be excited to follow your good Example.</HI></P>
<P>And now dear People, having, in a broken Manner, declared to you the&s;e Things which lay as a Weight on my Mind, there remains little but to propo&s;e to you, to try the Foun|dation of your Faith and Hope: Truth never lo&s;es by Examination, but &s;hines with greater Light and Splendor: Therefore, agreeable to the Apo&s;tle's Advice, "Examine your&s;elves, whether you be of the (true) Faith; know you not your &s;elves, how that CHRIST JESUS is in you, except you be Reprobates?" "That is, (&s;ays <HI>Grotious</HI>) Chri&s;tians in Name, and not in Deeds." Do not trifle, I be&s;eech you, in a Matter of &s;uch Importance, as the future Well-being of your immortal Souls! To be mi&s;taken in this Point, will be of fatal Con|&s;equence; Errors of this Sort being only to be rectify'd while we remain in this Life; for we
<PB N="139" REF="006166_0138_1027FE66F0CDF908">
are po&s;itively told, <HI>That there is no Wi&s;dom, nor Knowledge, Work, nor Device, in the Grave, whither we are all ha&s;tening.</HI> And our Lord tells us, He wrought while it was Day, and excites us &s;o to do, by &s;aying, <HI>The Night cometh wherein no Man can Work.</HI> Let us there|fore enquire whether our Faith is &s;uch an One as operates by Love: <HI>If ye love me, keep my Commandments,</HI> &s;ays our ble&s;&s;ed Lord. Let us remember what Ob&s;tacles this true Faith re|moved for the primitive Chri&s;tians, what Dif|ficulties it enabled them to &s;urmount. <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. "Without this Faith (in the Power of CHRIST) it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God." "I will (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI>) &s;hew thee my Faith by my Works; for as the Body, without the Spirit, is dead, &s;o Faith, without Works, is dead al&s;o. Ye are my Friends (&s;ays CHRIST) if ye do what&s;oever I command."</P>
<P>What will it avail us, tho' his outward Go&s;pel be taught in our Land, if we do not obey his Law written in our Hearts, and conform to its Rule and Government. And tho' CHRIST our Lord is the Fountain to clean&s;e us from the Pollution of Sin; yet if we refu&s;e to be puri|fied by his &s;piritual Bapti&s;m; "If he wa&s;h us not, we can have no Part in Him," nor his Me|rits. And indeed my Friends, I have taken &s;ome Pains, by divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to examine and enquire how I might have a well-grounded Hope to obtain Salvation, or, in other Words, eternal Life and Happine&s;s. And in all my En|quiries and Re&s;earches, I have not been able to di&s;cover any other Way than this, which the
<PB N="140" REF="006166_0139_1027FE6C360A4638">
Almighty continues to direct Mankind in at this Day, as well as heretofore, "The Way of Ho|line&s;s thro' CHRIST," he being the Author of eternal Salvation to all Believers. "Be ye ho|ly, as I the Lord your God am holy;" and "without Holine&s;s, no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord:" And I find I can be made &s;o no other Way, but thro' "Sanctification of the Spirit, unto the Obedience of Faith, and Sprinkling of the Blood of JESUS CHRIST." For every one who has, or can rea&s;onably have any Foun|dation of Hope to be &s;aved by CHRIST's Life, Sufferings, Re&s;urrection, A&s;cen&s;ion, and Medi|ation, mu&s;t, by his Grace a&s;&s;i&s;ting, purify him&s;elf, as he is pure; as no unclean Thing can po&s;&s;ibly enter his holy Kingdom. And it is by his Grace we are &s;aved, thro' Faith, operating by Love, "not of our&s;elves, it is the Gift of God!" Thus, as I became obedient to the Teaching of this Grace received, I came to wit|ne&s;s Mercy and Peace multiplied to me; for which, in great Reverence and Humility, I de|&s;ire always to ble&s;s God, the Father of our Lord JESUS, for His un&s;peakable Gift! and for his abundant Mercy wherewith he hath vi|&s;ited my Soul in his Day-&s;pring from his high and holy Pre&s;ence; and afforded me a good Foundation to hope for his Salvation; and I de|&s;ire to give all the Glory to God, and to &s;ay, "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy great Name and Power, be the Glory!" <HI>Be ye holy,</HI> is a Precept which contains no My&s;tery; here is no <HI>Enigma</HI> to unriddle; no Need of Commentators; no Room for <HI>Sceptici&s;m,</HI> nor

Controver&s;y; but a plain and po&s;itive Command, &s;o legible, that he that runs may read; the Wayfaring Man, tho' a Fool (with re&s;pect to the Wi&s;dom of the World) cannot err here. Therefore &s;uffer me to coun&s;el you, to break off the Sin that you find ea&s;ily be&s;et you, by Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and your Iniquities by Amend|ment of Life; that &s;o your Tranquility may be lengthened, and attend you beyond the Grave.

Of what E&s;teem then will be all your Plea&s;ures, and all your Toys? The greate&s;t and mo&s;t exalted of all human Glory, "even Crowns them&s;elves will then be Toys."

And when we look back, and make our Appeal to God, as good King <HI>Hezekiah</HI> did on his Death-bed;

Or whether God will give him Grace to repent? And if he does, who wou'd venture the Hazard of a Death-Bed Repentance? Whether after a long Life of

If they Sin on till they harden them&s;elves in Sin, and are for&s;aken of the Grace of God; if Death come long before they expected, and cut them off by Surprize, and without Warning, if their dying and de&s;pairing Agonies and Horrors, &s;hould not prove a godly Sorrow, nor that Repentance to Salvation not to be repented of, they are lo&s;t to Eternity! And what Man in his Sen&s;es wou'd expo&s;e his Soul to &s;uch a Hazard as this? Who wou'd not take Care to make his Calling and Election &s;ure before Death comes, and in a Matter of &s;uch great Concernment (wherein one Mi&s;carriage is irreparable) to prevent Dan|ger at a Di&s;tance. Some Men talk of Death, as if it were a Thing that could be done in two or three Days, and that the proper Time of doing it was a little before they die. But I know of no other Preparation for Death, but living well, which is the only &s;ure Evidence for Heaven. Men may cheat them&s;elves with vain Hopes and Imaginations when they come to die; but nothing will be a &s;olid Foundation for Peace, but an univer&s;al Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

<P>I have &s;ometimes thought it would be of &s;ingular Advantage to Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity of all Denominations, &s;eriou&s;ly to examine and enquire of your own Hearts, what our Religion has done for us; or what Benefits have accrued to us from it? Whether the Grace we have re|ceived has a&s;&s;i&s;ted us to re&s;i&s;t the Temptations of our Soul's Adver&s;ary; and whether we are nearer Salvation than when we fir&s;t believed?

Are all old things done away (<HI>for he that is in CHRIST is a new Creature</HI>) and do I experience new Thoughts, new De&s;ires, new Conver&s;ation, a total Change, all Things become regular, uni|form and con&s;i&s;tent with my high and holy Cal|ling? Is CHRIST the be&s;t beloved of my Soul? Does my Heart pant and mine Eyes fail for his Salvation? Is my Soul a thir&s;t for God? Do I long for his Pre&s;ence more than for hidden Trea&s;ure? Do I love God above all other Con|&s;iderations (and my Neighbour as my&s;elf?) Am I careful le&s;t I offend him? Do I live in con|&s;tant Ob&s;ervance of his Laws, do I live in his Fear?

Religion is an Heart Work, it mu&s;t be begun, and carried on and compleated there: Nothing but keeping God's Commandments will entitle us to his Fa|vour: Nothing &s;hort of having di&s;charged our Parts in the Chri&s;tian Warfare, and obtained a Victory over Sin, will entitle us to a Crown of Glory: Nothing le&s;s than being true and faith|ful Members of CHRIST's Church Militant here on Earth, will ever admit us Members of his Church triumphant in the Heavens. 'Tis to tho&s;e that overcome that our Lord will give to &s;it with him in his Throne; even as he over|came, and is &s;et down with his Father in his Throne. A being convinc'd in our Judgments of God's Goodne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that his Laws are righteous altogether, and therefore we ought to obey them, is not Conver&s;ion. Faith is not Practice; therefore <HI>add to your Faith Virtue, to Virtue Knowledge, to Knowledge Temperance, to Temperance Patience, to Patience Godline&s;s, to

<P>Thus my dear Friends and Neighbours, I have declar'd in great Truth and Sincerity, my earne&s;t Concern and De&s;ire for the real Happi|ne&s;s of the Inhabitants of my native Country in general; and having an e&s;pecial and peculiar Regard for many that I have known for a Se|ries of Years, when I have reflected on the bare Po&s;&s;ibility of your mi&s;&s;ing Heaven and Happi|ne&s;s thro' Inadvertency, Incon&s;ideration, and an inordinate Love for the Things of this Life, it has been Subject of Mourning to me; and e&s;pe|cially as I have thro' Mercy &s;een, that when I was in the like Situation, how dangerous a One it was, and that all who are in this un|happy Ca&s;e, &s;tand indeed in &s;lippery Places. And many a Time has my Soul grieved &s;ecret|ly, when I have ob&s;erved the Pur&s;uits of &s;uch, how earne&s;tly they are running after Vanities, and pur&s;uing Lies (which will indeed deceive) and turning their Backs on God's Offers of Love, and refu&s;e to let him put his Beauty on them, and to make them glorious within; and &s;ince I have witne&s;&s;ed the great Di&s;proportion between the Love of God, and the Love of the World, I am the more earne&s;tly concern'd to invite you to come ta&s;te and &s;ee of the Goodne&s;s of the Lord; O make but Trial of his Love, and you'll &s;ay the one half was not told you. Then will you find the mo&s;t exalted Happine&s;s this World can yield, will be nothing, and Vanity, yea, lighter than Vanity; but were you once in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Love of God, you'd be

&s;en&s;ible that you inherited Sub&s;tance, &s;ub&s;tan|tial Joys, un&s;peakable Delight, Satisfaction and Peace. O! that this unutterable Love of God might be once impre&s;s'd and engraven on your Hearts; Then would you confe&s;s with me, that one Day in his Courts, Pre&s;ence and Favour, is better than a thou&s;and &s;pent in the Enjoyment of earthly Delights and Plea&s;ures. But now I would &s;top a while, and ask, If you have not been cheated by delu&s;ive Hopes and Promi&s;es of obtaining Satisfaction from temporal Enjoy|ments? Have you never di&s;cover'd their Falla|cy? Have they not Vani&s;hed into Air, even when you fancy'd your&s;elves ju&s;t in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? And don't you find they leave you di&s;&s;atisfied and unea&s;y? I am certain this is the Ca&s;e with many; you &s;till feel a painful Vacancy, even in the mid&s;t of your &s;en&s;ual Delights and tempo|ral Enjoyments; which, be a&s;&s;ured (I &s;peak by happy tho' &s;hort Experience) nothing &s;hort of the Approbation and Favour of God, and a Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Love and Peace, can ever po&s;&s;ibly &s;atisfy. I have told you already, that I have felt great Trouble and Anxiety of Mind on your Account; but tho' my Head were Waters, and mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears; and cou'd I, or any one el&s;e, weep continually Day and Night for you, that you may re&s;t in the Day of Trouble; yet another's Concern cannot do this great Work for you, without your own Hand in the Bu&s;ine&s;s which relates to your Soul's Happine&s;s; &s;ince an in&s;pired Apo&s;tle a&s;|&s;ures you, you mu&s;t, by Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, "work out your own Salvation with Fear and

Trembling:" For no Man can redeem his Bro|ther, nor give to God a Ran&s;om for his Soul. I may (as I do earne&s;tly) de&s;ire your Happine&s;s, but I can't procure it for you. I may wi&s;h you Heaven, but I can't obtain it for you: Yet I earne&s;tly pray, <HI>That the God and Father of our Lord JESUS CHRIST may give unto you the Spirit of Wi&s;dom, and Revelation of the Knowledge of him&s;elf, whom</HI> (rightly) <HI>to know is eternal Life</HI>; that the Eyes of your Under|&s;tanding may be enlighten'd, and that <HI>you may know what is the Hope of his Calling; and the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints,</HI> and what the exceeding Greatne&s;s of his Power to us-ward who believe, according to the work|ing of his mighty Power, by which he has vanqui&s;hed and brought down all the &s;trong Holds of Sin and Satan in the Hearts of them who confide in his mighty Arm, which is now extended over you for Good; God has vi&s;ited and called you often, and now waits to be gra|cious to you: The Almighty I &s;ay, has long vi&s;ited and try'd you by his Mercy and For|bearance; He has &s;poke to you by the Voice of his Holy Spirit, which &s;ome of you have neglected, overlooked and quenched: Hath not Wi&s;dom long utter'd her Voice, even at your Doors? Is &s;he not come up into your Cham|bers? Does not Under&s;tanding cry in the mo&s;t &s;ecret Rece&s;&s;es of your Con&s;ciences, &s;aying, <HI>How long, ye &s;imple Ones, will you love Simpli|city, and Scorners delight in Scorning, and Fools hate Knowledge? Turn you therefore at the Re|proofs of In&s;truction, which is the Way to Life</HI>;
<PB N="154" REF="006166_0153_1027FE908AC1AD68">
and then behold he will more abundantly pour out of his Spirit upon you; and if ye hearken and obey his Voice, he will make his Words and Will known to you; on the contrary, if you continue to refu&s;e and rebel again&s;t his Light and Truth in your inward Parts, the Con&s;equence is &s;ure, He will certainly for&s;ake and leave you to your own Delu&s;ions; becau&s;e he hath call'd, and you refu&s;ed; he hath &s;tretched forth his Hand, and no Man regards; but have &s;et at nought all his Coun&s;el, turn'd his Word behind your Backs, and will hear none of his Reproofs. Therefore unle&s;s you re|turn and repent, with all your Hearts, and amend your Ways and your Doings, he will, when your Di&s;tre&s;s comes upon you, laugh at your Calamities, have you in Deri&s;ion, and mock at all your Fears.</P>
<P>But I fervently pray, that this may never be your deplorable Condition; but that you may be, not only the Vi&s;ited, but the Redeemed of the Lord; not only the Called, but the Cho|&s;en of God! And, in order to make your Calling and Election &s;ure, take to your&s;elves the whole Armour of God, that you may &s;tand again&s;t the Wiles of the Enemy of your Soul's Happine&s;s; <HI>Having your Loins girt about with Truth, and having on the Brea&s;t-plate of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and your Feet &s;hod with the Prepara|tion of the Go&s;pel; but, above all, taking the Shield of Faith, whereby you'll be able to with|&s;tand and quench all the fiery Darts of the Wicked One; and take the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word</HI>

(or Power) <HI>of God.</HI> Finally, <HI>What&s;oever Things are true, what&s;oever Things are hone&s;t, what&s;o|ever Things are ju&s;t, what&s;oever Things are love|ly, what&s;oever Things are of good Report; if there be any Virtue, if there be any Prai&s;e; think on the&s;e Things and practi&s;e them.
