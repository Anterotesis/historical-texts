<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the &s;pirit of truth, and not of adulation, does the following performance &s;olicit your attention. Nor is its hope of acquiring &s;ome &s;hare of your coun|tenance dimini&s;hed, by the circum&s;tance of your not having in an official character withheld your &s;ignature, from &s;everal of the mea&s;ures inve&s;tigated.</P>
<P>A re&s;pon&s;ibility in the chief magi&s;trate, for the effects of every legi&s;lative act&mdash;an avowal, that unfore&s;een con&s;equences, however mi&s;chievous, ought to be &s;ub|mitted to, for the &s;ake of con&s;i&s;tency in error&mdash;that ex|periment in &s;earch of truth, is to be rejected; are po|&s;itions to which a liberal and enlightened mind will ne|ver accede.</P>
<P>Your general a&s;&s;ent to laws ought to be a&s;cribed to republican principles, and not to an indi&s;criminate ap|probation of their contents. To your&s;elf therefore, as well as to every other citizen, remains intire the inva|luable birth-right of freedom in the re-examination of public mea&s;ures. For &s;urely the right and duties of a citizen cannot be ab&s;orbed by official functions.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="027782_0003_0FD63F8D702D0200">
Whil&s;t, under the influence of republicani&s;m, you have cautiou&s;ly checked the will of the people, you have al&s;o re&s;erved your negative power, to be exerted on great and momentous occa&s;ions, for the pre&s;ervation of their rights. Such an occa&s;ion occured in a <HI>direct</HI> attempt upon the principles of repre&s;entation, the de|feat of which &s;ufficiently evinces, that you cannot ap|prove of the <HI>indirect</HI> means by which the&s;e principles have been &s;o much more deeply wounded, than that attempt contemplated. Can it then be delu&s;ion to che|ri&s;h a hope, that a&s;&s;aults directed again&s;t the vital organ of popular government, are de&s;tined to be defeated by the &s;ame laudable vigilance?</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.&mdash;NO FREE GOVERNMENT OR THE BLESS|INGS OF LIBERTY CAN BE PRESERVED TO ANY PEO|PLE, BUT BY A FREQUENT RECURRENCE TO FUN|DAMENTAL PRINCIPLES.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tate of politics at all times, ought to attract the attention of a nation, jealous of its liberty, lately purcha&s;ed at the expence of much blood and trea|&s;ure. To what more important &s;ubject, can a portion of our attention and enquiries be applied? Private im|morality, is often confined to the de&s;truction of an in|dividual, whil&s;t political immorality will ruin a nation. When the hone&s;t and un&s;u&s;picious, are falling into the &s;nares of the &s;elfi&s;h and cunning, it behoves all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;ingle &s;ympathetic &s;park, to &s;ound the alarm; and when an alarm is &s;ounded, temerity and folly only, will have to deplore the want of prudence and caution.</P>
<P>National watchfulne&s;s is the only pre&s;ervative of liberty. A patriot magi&s;tracy hardly appears to glad|den the hi&s;toric page, once in a century. Shall Ame|ricans then rely on a phenomenon to guard their rights? Fanatici&s;m alone will fondly wait for a miracle. Or &s;hall we call in the aid of plain and unerring arithmetic, from whence to extract a rule for our conduct. Cal|culate. How many bad kings for one good one are recorded in hi&s;tory? A&s;certain this, and the re&s;ult ex|hibits
<PB N="2" REF="027782_0005_0FD63F90934C75D0">
the exact chance for freedom, held by the tenure of a <HI>blind</HI> and <HI>implicit</HI> reliance on the integrity of the magi&s;tracy.</P>
<P>If to be watchful at all times, is a nece&s;&s;ary effort of national prudence, the precept is pronounced by the tongue of liberty to be indi&s;pen&s;able, at an epoch of ex|periment. Corrupt morals in a &s;tate of infancy, fore|bode a licentious manhood, and a wicked old age.&mdash;By giving a proper tone to a young government, and rooting an admini&s;tration in the &s;ound principles of political morality, happine&s;s will be acquired for our|&s;elves and our po&s;terity. By &s;paring the rod, we may &s;poil the child. Like an ill weed which grows apace, it will &s;oon become too &s;trong for correction, and in|&s;tead of being a ble&s;&s;ing, it will turn out a cur&s;e to its parents.</P>
<P>To leave the allegory. As a bad form of govern|ment, may by means of a good admini&s;tration, produce national happine&s;s, &s;o a good form of government, may be abu&s;ed into an engine of fraud and corruption. Mi&s;chievous precedents, or innovations upon the con|&s;titution, are matured by time into municipal regulati|ons, or fundamental rules. Antiquity will begin to &s;hew its &s;ilvered locks, and under the di&s;gui&s;e of &s;ancti|ty, will lay hold of the fir&s;t admi&s;&s;ible moment to in|trench it&s;elf behind the bulwark of pre&s;cription. Cu&s;|tom will be arrayed again&s;t rea&s;on. Prejudice, intere&s;t, ridicule, invective, authority and power, will appear as auxiliaries to the former; whil&s;t the latter will have no ally, except argument, and mu&s;t al&s;o a&s;&s;ume the unplea|&s;ant language of reformation. Combating with &s;uch odds, a defeat would be almo&s;t inevitable, and afflicting would be the &s;en&s;ations of hone&s;t men in the reflection, that by their &s;upinene&s;s they have betrayed the mo&s;t &s;acred depo&s;it, in&s;tead of tran&s;mitting it unimpaired to po&s;terity.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="027782_0006_0FD63F92221E5C18">
Every acqui&s;ition is infallibly lo&s;t by inattention.&mdash;Liberty, tho' ine&s;timable, is the mo&s;t difficult to pre|&s;erve. It is incapable of being &s;ecured by bars and bolts, and is therefore con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to the pilla|ges of intere&s;t. It is a general indivi&s;ible property, whence few feel a particular obligation or intere&s;t, to be militant under its banner. It is committed to the cu&s;|tody of magi&s;trates, but in the end they &s;eldom fail to betray their tru&s;t, unle&s;s awed by the &s;ocial juri&s;diction. Are magi&s;trates enraptured with her beauties, and jea|lous le&s;t others &s;hould participate in her charms? Or do they dete&s;t a deity, who be&s;tows liberally upon all, becau&s;e it is her character to be&s;tow impartially?</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;aults upon the virtue of men in power, if facts can be a&s;certained from effects, mu&s;t be hard to with|&s;tand. But many brilliant examples exi&s;t, proving that they are not irre&s;i&s;table. A frequent and firm national enquiry into the mea&s;ures of government, will check political vice, and reward political virtue. The ardour of hone&s;ty will be awakened. What incitement to pa|trioti&s;m exi&s;ts, if the good and bad&mdash;the hone&s;t and knavi&s;h&mdash;the benevolent and mi&s;anthropic, are depo&s;i|ted by national &s;upinene&s;s in one common oblivious receptacle? Self intere&s;t, chicanery, peculation, and not public e&s;teem, will &s;hapen the admini&s;tration. Ma|gi&s;trates will provide &s;uch a recompence as they love, and when &s;ordid pa&s;&s;ions are to be gratified, and are their own carvers, what degree of moderation is to be expected? The wheat can only be &s;eparated from the chaff by &s;ifting. Lazine&s;s in politics is like lazine&s;s in agriculture. It will expo&s;e the &s;oil to noxious weeds. The whole&s;ome plants will &s;hrink from a &s;tate of indi&s;|criminate amne&s;ty, and di&s;daining a di&s;honorable &s;o|ciety, will leave the field in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tares and thi&s;tles.</P>
<P>If the&s;e principles are political axioms, whence hap|pens it, that the direction in which the American go|vernment
<PB N="4" REF="027782_0007_0FD63F94DC961998">
is moving, hath hardly attracted the public notice of the particular &s;tates, or of private individuals? Is this direction invariably right? Is it univer&s;ally &s;a|tisfactory? Have intere&s;t, ridicule or invective, depri|ved truth of her articulating powers? Or is the brow|beaten by power or authority?</P>
<P>That this univer&s;al &s;atisfaction does not exi&s;t, is exhi|bited by almo&s;t every private company. It is often a&s;|&s;erted that the admini&s;tration is driving at monarchy&mdash;that the legi&s;lature is corrupt&mdash;and that the con&s;titution has been more deliberately broken, than it was formed.</P>
<P>The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions are alarming. They de&s;erve inve&s;ti|gation. The national mind is moved, and mu&s;t be &s;a|tisfied. Shew it the good or harm which awaits the community, that it may either rejoice in the one, or repel the other.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of a Pre&s;idential revolution, is a pro|per period from whence to look back. Let us con&s;ider whether the retro&s;pect exhibits encouragement to pro|ceed, and to what ultimate point the &s;ame direction will probably lead us.</P>
<P>Will you, reader, accompany me in &s;uch reflections? Ye &s;overeign &s;tates, will you contribute your contin|gents of inve&s;tigation? It may obviate a nece&s;&s;ity for contingents of another nature, upon &s;ome occa&s;ion, which may not be very di&s;tant.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II.&mdash;THE PRINCIPLES OF THE INVESTI|GATION.</HEAD>
<P>BUT before we proceed it is proper to form a political compa&s;s to guide our cour&s;e. If political <HI>principles</HI> exi&s;t&mdash;if the <HI>rights of man,</HI> are words of real mean|ing;
<PB N="5" REF="027782_0008_0FD63F967679D4D0">
if there are none favoured of heaven, with an in&s;crip|tion of &s;upremacy on their foreheads, &s;urely there can be no difficulty in &s;electing a few &s;imple axioms, beyond the reach of polemical artifice, and containing a degree of internal evidence, compelling indubitable conviction.</P>
<P>Unhappily we dare not rely intirely on the con&s;titu|tion of the United States. That hath indeed a con&s;o|lation, in not having been treated wor&s;e than the holy &s;criptures. Political and religious here&s;y, being of kindred families, will act from &s;imilar motives. Nei|ther will ever want a text to defend its u&s;urpations up|on orthodox principles either human or divine, becau&s;e neither have in view the public good. And &s;elf inter|e&s;t is the mo&s;t indu&s;trious principle imaginable, in hunt|ing out ca&s;ui&s;tical arguments and di&s;tinctions, to de|lude mankind into a &s;tate, the mo&s;t favourable for its de&s;igns. It would be difficult for in&s;tance, for a man of under&s;tanding, who&s;e only motive was the common good, to find in the con&s;titution, a &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion which contemplated the erection of banks, or other corporations. For corporations are only deeds of gift, or of bargain and &s;ale, for portions of valuable <HI>common</HI> rights; and <HI>parts</HI> may be di&s;po&s;ed of until the whole is di&s;tributed among a few individuals. But yet, poli|tical here&s;y, views of intere&s;t, and a union of talents and indu&s;try, may puzzle, perplex and mi&s;lead, even a &s;ound head, and a good heart. Hence ari&s;es an argument for avoiding &s;o broad a theoremic ba&s;is, as the con&s;ti|tution of the United States.</P>
<P>A &s;election of plain, tho' great principles, re&s;ulting from the con&s;titution, as the theorems to guide our in|ve&s;tigations into the objects and de&s;igns of the admini&s;|tration, is the only remaining alternative. Without a te&s;t for truth, &s;elf intere&s;t and innovation, by their wily ar|tifices, will &s;lip out of our gra&s;p. Or by a&s;&s;uming new and harmle&s;s forms, they may withdraw them&s;elves from the view, even of an inve&s;tigating eye.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="027782_0009_0FD63F9A81557610">
Are not the following propo&s;itions unque&s;tionable?</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the con&s;titution contemplates a <HI>republican</HI> form of government, flowing from and depending on the people; and that a mode of admini&s;tration, de&s;tructive of &s;uch dependence, and introductory of <HI>monarchical ingredients,</HI> innovates upon and &s;ub|verts the con&s;titution.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That Congre&s;s can impo&s;e taxes for the <HI>common</HI> defence and <HI>general</HI> welfare, of the United States, but not for the benefit of individuals or their <HI>own private emolument.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the right of legi&s;lation, re&s;ided, and yet re|&s;ides in the people of the United States.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That this right is periodically delegated by electi|on to their repre&s;entatives.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That the right of election is a &s;ub&s;tance and not a form, and that a legitimate repre&s;entation, implies an <HI>exi&s;ting operative</HI> principle, in the repre&s;enting, im|pelling them for the good of the repre&s;ented.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That whenever this principle cea&s;es to exi&s;t, go|vernment is converted into an u&s;urpation.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Let the&s;e po&s;itions con&s;titute the text. Compare with it &s;trictly the en&s;uing commentary. Con&s;ider if the arguments are conformable and appo&s;ite. With|out much reflection we a&s;&s;ent to propo&s;itions, &s;elf evi|dently true, but a compo&s;ition of rea&s;onings, deducing political effects from political cau&s;es, and trying mea|&s;ures by the te&s;t of principle, require con&s;ideration. If conviction would fla&s;h in upon our minds, when a public mi&s;chief was barely named, argument would be &s;uperfluous. And yet too ready an a&s;&s;ent, leaves the mind unprepared to repel the deceitful efforts, which will be made to delude it; whereas a conviction, re|&s;ulting from a deliberate inve&s;tigation is hard to &s;hake. The following performance &s;olicits nothing, but a cir|cum&s;pect con&s;ideration. Con&s;cious of human weak|ne&s;s, it pre&s;umes not to &s;et up for infallibility; and in exerting its own privilege of thinking, only de&s;igns to
<PB N="7" REF="027782_0010_0FD63F9CB771C960">
induce others to think al&s;o. Con&s;cious too of politi|cal purity, a detection of its errors will give it plea&s;ure, whil&s;t it will cling to its truths with principled fidelity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III.&mdash;THE BANK OF THE UNITED STATES CONSIDERED.</HEAD>
<P>THE bank of the United States, is the ma&s;ter key of that &s;y&s;tem, which governs the admini&s;tration. It could unlock a depo&s;itory of &s;ecrets, which would, if expo&s;ed, reflect much light upon the &s;ubject. But we are confined to the information to be extracted from the law it&s;elf, and its obvious effects; premi&s;ing however, that &s;ecrets enacted by law, are &s;ecret laws. They ope|rate upon the ignorant, and puni&s;h the innocent; and are as inevitable, as the &s;troke of death. An in&s;tituti|on, the object of which is gain, would not have &s;tudi|ou&s;ly legali&s;ed the privacy of its tran&s;actions, unle&s;s that privacy had begotten gain. The value to &s;ome, of be|ing in the &s;ecret, is preci&s;ely the amount of a fraudu|lent lo&s;s inflicted upon others, who are not &s;o.</P>
<P>It is about to be proved, that a de&s;ign for erecting ari&s;tocracy and monarchy, is &s;ub&s;i&s;ting&mdash;that a <HI>money im|pul&s;e,</HI> and not the <HI>public good,</HI> is operating on Congre&s;s; and that taxes are impo&s;ed upon motives, other than the general welfare. The leading evidence evincing the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, is to be extracted from the bank &s;cheme, which was contrived, propo&s;ed, and modelled by the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, and therefore it is &s;elected as the fir&s;t &s;ubject of inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of banking, is &s;imply a reiterated ex|change of obligations for the payment of money. A. gives his <HI>bond</HI> to B. and receives B's <HI>bond</HI> in exchange. But A. pays B. an intere&s;t, whereas B. pays A. none. A. is the <HI>community,</HI> B. is the <HI>bank.</HI> How mu&s;t this traffic end?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="027782_0011_0FD63FA0676FC788">
This idea requires illu&s;tration. In a barter of two commodities, two intere&s;ts only are concerned, altho' each of the&s;e intere&s;ts may be compounded of many individuals. Thus buyer and &s;eller compri&s;e many per&s;ons, though they con&s;i&s;t of but two cla&s;&s;es. All tho&s;e who deal with the bank, con&s;titute one cla&s;s, and the &s;tockholders, or proprietors of the bank, another. The dealers depo&s;it their bonds or notes carrying an intere&s;t, and receive in exchange the bonds or notes of the &s;tockholders, carrying no intere&s;t. And the difference between receiving an intere&s;t out of paper, whil&s;t it pays none on &s;imilar paper, con&s;titutes the great ground of profit to the bank.</P>
<P>The &s;cheme repre&s;ents the idea of a perpetual rota|tion, depo&s;iting a profit at every revolution. It might have been compared to a &s;pecies of hazard, called the A. B. C. table, except that the latter propo&s;es to the adventurers &s;ome chance to win; whereas the bank can never lo&s;e. The table bets with its gamblers up|on every revolution 100 to 102&frac12;, &s;o that in forty re|volutions, the adventurers bet two to one. Yet a chance for winning exi&s;ts. But in that re&s;pect the compari&s;on fails. The bank is perpetually betting 100 to 106, the wager is always drawn, and the bank re|ceives the &s;ix in every hundred, by way of forfeit.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e two per&s;ons were every moment in the year exchanging bonds, one paying an intere&s;t of &s;ix per centum, and the other not, how would matters &s;tand when a &s;ettlement took place? The gain acquired by one, would be preci&s;ely &s;imilar to that which con&s;ti|tutes the dividend of banks. In a private ca&s;e, it would be called a gro&s;s device, to evade the &s;tatutes of u&s;ury; and yet the enactors of tho&s;e &s;tatutes have le|gali&s;ed the &s;ame device in the erection of banks, and thus &s;ubject the whole community to that which would be a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> upon an individual.</P>
<P>The bank evidently con&s;titutes one cla&s;s, and tho&s;e who deal with it another. It evidently appears that
<PB N="9" REF="027782_0012_0FD63FA2871A11C8">
the bank mu&s;t gain. This gain nece&s;&s;arily implies a lo&s;s, becau&s;e the traffic is of an unproductive nature. 'Tis a traffic in ideas, not in &s;ub&s;tances. But it is not &s;o ea&s;y to di&s;cern upon whom this lo&s;s falls. And this is a difficulty, which the favourers of the artifice have taken care to promote, becau&s;e a detection upon this point would blow up the contrivance.</P>
<P>And yet a &s;mall portion of reflection mu&s;t get over it. The misfortune mu&s;t fall upon &s;omebody. The immediate dealers with the bank mu&s;t bear it, or they are reimbur&s;ed by tho&s;e who deal with them. There|fore the lo&s;s mu&s;t fall upon the whole community, or a part of it. What defence of the in&s;titution would it be, to &s;ay, that it &s;elects a devoted few for annual ruin, whil&s;t it &s;pares the great ma&s;s of the community? If the mon&s;ter is to be fed on human labour, it would be fair to determine the victim by lot, as to re&s;ort to a decoy.</P>
<P>But it would be unju&s;t to impeach the bank of an impo&s;ition, not palliated by the &s;ubterfuge, "that tho&s;e impo&s;ed on are able to bear the lo&s;s." To this &s;pecies of palliation, it is certainly entitled. For if the lo&s;s nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulting from the traffic, had fallen exclu&s;ively on the immediate adventurers, inevitable and &s;peedy ruin mu&s;t have en&s;ued from the enormous profit of the bank; and the de&s;truction of &s;ome would have deterred others from adventuring within the reach of this devouring mon&s;ter. A contrary effect is clearly ob&s;ervable; and therefore the immediate deal|ers mu&s;t, by &s;ome circuitous operation, obtain a re|imbur&s;ement. Hence the bank may certainly boa&s;t, that the evils &s;he di&s;pen&s;es, like the contents of Pan|dora's box, are pretty equally di&s;tributed.</P>
<P>Though it might redound to our amu&s;ement to trace this operation, it would contribute but little to our edification. The conclu&s;ion will be better evinced
<PB N="10" REF="027782_0013_0FD63FA28A809940">
by a few &s;trong lines, than by an a&s;&s;emblage of the mo&s;t diver&s;ified colourings. The gain is made. The lo&s;s cannot fall on the immediate gamblers, for two rea&s;ons. They are not ruined, nor do they work. Gain can never ari&s;e out of nothing, becau&s;e it is &s;ub|&s;tantial. It mu&s;t therefore be the product of labour, and labour only; and that which produces the gain, mu&s;t of cour&s;e bear the lo&s;s. The gamblers them&s;elves are only the brokers between the bank and tho&s;e who really &s;uffer by the in&s;titution. Brokers add nothing to the commodity. They carry on the traffic between their employers to a great amount for a profit. If they made no profit, they would cea&s;e to pur&s;ue the profe&s;&s;ion. The immediate receivers of the bank pa|per, circulate it identically, or virtually, among their principals, who pay both their profit, and the gain of the bank. This gain flows in upon the bank in num|berle&s;s devious &s;treams, &s;upplied by the whole commu|nity. The&s;e &s;treams, unle&s;s thus &s;upplied, would have become dry, becau&s;e they would have exhau&s;ted a few unfed re&s;ervoirs. But they appear to be inex|hau&s;tible, and therefore they mu&s;t ari&s;e from the la|bour of the community, which is the only inexhau&s;ti|ble, ever running fountain of wealth.</P>
<P>The principals of the&s;e brokers, are the original &s;ellers of whatever labour produces, and the con&s;umers of the wares the brokers deal in. This definition in|cludes the whole agricultural, mechanical, profe&s;&s;ional and mercantile intere&s;ts of the community, unconcern|ed in the device. And upon this aggregate mu&s;t fall the gain &s;o regularly collected by the bank.</P>
<P>Without perplexing our&s;elves, to trace out the vari|ous modes, by which the fir&s;t dealers with the bank are reimbur&s;ed from the wealth of this aggregate, it may not be ami&s;s to &s;elect one, the features of which are &s;o gro&s;s and prominent, as not ea&s;ily to be for|gotten.</P>

The &s;y&s;tem throws into a few hands, a monopoly of the bulk of the circulating medium. If a man could monopolize any nece&s;&s;ary article of commerce, he would gain, by borrowing money at &s;ix per centum to effect &s;uch an object. In the event, he would not lo&s;e this inte|re&s;t. The profits re&s;ulting from his monopoly, would reimbur&s;e it manifold. The intere&s;t, as well as his pro|fit, would be reimbur&s;ed by tho&s;e upon whom the mo|nopoly operated. <HI>Can any monopoly be more diffu&s;ive in its operations, than that of the great bulk of the circulating medium.</HI></P>
<P>Such a monoply is a kind of general &s;earch warrant for wealth, &s;ilently penetrating, and con&s;tantly ex|tracting from, the mo&s;t &s;ecure funds. The profits of the national labour, are in the &s;ituation of a trea&s;ure, gradually dimini&s;hed by &s;ecret and continual thefts.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV.&mdash;THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>THE powers of a weapon ought to be thoroughly under&s;tood, before we venture to try its edge.&mdash;A bank is a machine of &s;uch wonderful and cunning contrivances, that we mu&s;t be content to proceed much farther in our enquiries, before we &s;hall comprehend its mechani&s;m, or be able to form a competent judg|ment of its effects.</P>
<P>If the rea&s;onings of the la&s;t &s;ection are ju&s;t, we are forcibly impelled to an awful idea. The reader has already exclaimed, that the profits of the bank are ob|viou&s;ly an indirect tax upon the community. He is right, and it is impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t cunning argu|mentative delu&s;ion to refute the a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Can the pecuniary nece&s;&s;ities of a government be &s;upplied by any po&s;&s;ible contrivance, which will not operate as a tax? If an an&s;wer is given in the affirma|tive, divulge, we reply, the glorious &s;ecret for man|kind,
<PB N="12" REF="027782_0015_0FD63FA5D9852078">
by which they may enjoy all the benefits of good government, without paying for them. If in the ne|gative, we thus proceed:</P>
<P>The capital of the United States' bank is ten millions, of which the United States own two. The dividend is eight per centum per annum. This alone is an annual income of 800,000 dollars, of which 160,000 belong to the nation. The whole dividend, though but an article of the income, is con&s;iderably more than &s;uffi|cient to defray the whole expence of the civil govern|ment. If it was the property of the continent, it would be thus applied, and in &s;uch an event, would the government be carried on, without any expence to the community?</P>
<P>Except for the unaccountable infatuation which ex|i&s;ts upon the &s;ubject, arguments, as to this point, would appear puerile. Becau&s;e po&s;itions, evidently true, re|quire no proof.</P>
<P>If the whole profits of the bank had been rai&s;ed and applied for public u&s;e, as a part really are, it mu&s;t be admitted, that it would have been an indirect tax, un|til it is proved, that government po&s;&s;e&s;s a faculty of &s;up|porting it&s;elf, by paper &s;light of hand, without burthen|ing the community.</P>
<P>It then occurs to demand, whether the nature of the contribution is altered as to the payers, by a tran&s;mu|tation of tho&s;e who receive the tribute? Is it the le&s;s a tax upon the community, becau&s;e it is received by an individual corporation, con&s;i&s;ting of a few private per|&s;ons, many of them foreigners?</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e we borrow one of tho&s;e newly invented expre&s;&s;ions, conveying no determinate idea, and cal|culated to deceive: And in&s;tead of calling the bank act a tax law, baptize it thus, "a law exerci&s;ing a <HI>faculty</HI> of government." It mu&s;t yet be confe&s;&s;ed, that it is a very valuable <HI>faculty.</HI> It is worth to the bank of the
<PB N="13" REF="027782_0016_0FD63FA8038638C0">
United States, an annuity, more than &s;ufficient to defray the whole expence of civil government, and to all the banks now operating, an income probably equi|valent to the public expences, both ordinary and extra|ordinary.</P>
<P>But whatever is its value, it was undoubtedly a pub|lic property, becau&s;e the legi&s;lature in exerci&s;ing this faculty, were public, and not private agents. The con|veyance then of this faculty by law, was a gift or bar|gain and &s;ale, of &s;o much public property to private per&s;ons. If the former, it be&s;towed upon them gra|tuitou&s;ly, an immen&s;e revenue, which can only ari&s;e from the common &s;tock of wealth; if the latter, it &s;ells in a ratio of 800,000 dollars annually of faculty, for the privilege of having 160,000 dollars of the &s;ame faculty, annually re&s;tored. In either view, the mea&s;ure was a public folly, and a private gain.</P>
<P>The public po&s;&s;e&s;s a great variety of valuable facul|ties. In parcelling them out among an ari&s;tocracy, whom we &s;ee growing up as if by the power of magic, a di&s;po&s;ition by portions, would have been le&s;s grievous than to give them all away at once. The faculties of &s;ome cities, counties, and even &s;tates, be&s;towed upon private corporations, would yet have left others in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their rights and privileges. And it would have been more excu&s;able for the legi&s;lature of a great nation, to have pro&s;tituted the public intere&s;t in a few particular in&s;tances, than to con&s;titute it&s;elf the bawd-general, for &s;upplying the in&s;atiable lu&s;t of an ari&s;tocracy. The attempt of Appius upon Virginia, was more tole|rable, than a general ari&s;tocratical inva&s;ion of the na|tional cha&s;tity. And yet, preferring death to pro&s;titution, her bright example arou&s;ed the Roman &s;pirit, and the virtue of a &s;imple maid, re&s;tored the liberty of a whole people.</P>
<P>The public faculties are the offsprings of labour.&mdash;Leaving therefore unmeaning terms, which may mi&s;|lead
<PB N="14" REF="027782_0017_0FD63FA939B4BC50">
or perplex us, we will re&s;ume expre&s;&s;ions, which convey a determinate idea.</P>
<P>Bank &s;tock is public debt. It is public debt of the wor&s;t kind, &s;ince it bears an enormous and incomputa|ble intere&s;t, as will hereafter be &s;hewn. Nothing but a tax can pay this intere&s;t, unle&s;s it is proved that the in|tere&s;t on the funded debt, might have been paid with|out a tax. And if this could be proved, then it would be replied, that the faculty ought to have been dedica|ted to that u&s;e.</P>
<P>The bank might have been &s;old to public creditors in lieu of intere&s;t. If the price had been ten millions of &s;ix per cents, and the profits eleven per centum, the purcha&s;ers would have made a good bargain, &s;uppo&s;ing they had depo&s;ited ten millions more of actual &s;pecie, as &s;tock upon which to circulate paper. But if they could have circulated ten millions of paper, upon a de|po&s;it of not more than one million of &s;pecie, as the bank probably does, the bargain would have been a good one, reducing the profit even to eight per centum.&mdash;Such a &s;oftening mea&s;ure, is &s;tated as illu&s;trating the perniciou&s;ne&s;s of the contrivance, and not as allowing that it would have been a &s;ufficient ground of ju&s;tifica|tion. Where is the merit of a &s;y&s;tem of finance, which u&s;es public property to increa&s;e, and not to dimini&s;h the public burthens?</P>
<P>Bank &s;tock is public debt of the mo&s;t ruinous kind, and yet no con&s;ideration was paid, <HI>really</HI> or <HI>nominally</HI> for it. If the legi&s;lature had pre&s;ented the bank proprie|tors with ten millions of funded debt, in lieu of this faculty, the community would have been great gainers, becau&s;e the profit accruing from the gift, could not have exceeded an average of between four and five per centum. If twenty millions had been &s;o pre&s;ented, even that would have been better for the community, becau&s;e the profit would not only have been as low as the gain made by the bank, but it would have been
<PB N="15" REF="027782_0018_0FD63FAAFA5B02B8">
known and limited&mdash;it might have been provided by tax-laws equalizing the burthen&mdash;it would have been &s;ubject to redemption&mdash;and above all, it would not have committed a depredation upon the fundamental princi|ples of repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Had &s;o much public debt been <HI>hone&s;tly,</HI> and not <HI>artificial|ly</HI> accumulated, it mu&s;t have been earned by labour, which would have produced a general di&s;tribution of it, obvi|ating an exorbitant accumulation of wealth in a few private hands.</P>
<P>But an effect, which was a leading motive for the contrivance would then have been defeated. Its chief de&s;ign was to make the rich, richer; and the poor, poorer. And thus I prove it.</P>
<P>Money and credit, or an equivalent for them, were to be depo&s;ited as the only mode of acquiring bank|&s;tock. The poor had neither to depo&s;it, the rich po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed both. An exclu&s;ion of the one, and a preference of the other, though not expre&s;&s;ed, was evidently de|&s;igned, becau&s;e it unavoidably re&s;ulted from the nature of the contrivance. And the effect an&s;wers the de&s;ign. A portion of the rich cla&s;s of citizens, are the pro|prietors of the device, whil&s;t labour &s;upports it. An annuity to a great amount, is &s;uddenly conjured up by law, which is received exclu&s;ively by the rich, that is the ari&s;tocracy. Will it not make them richer? It is paid out of labour, and labour in all countries falls on the poor. Will it not make this cla&s;s poorer? and do &s;uch effects tend to correct the principles of either?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a religious &s;ociety &s;hould be exclu&s;ively in|corporated, and by hook or crook provided with an ample revenue, payable from the labour of all &s;uch &s;ocieties. Would it not become an <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed church,</HI> and would it not impoveri&s;h and eventually &s;wallow up all others? A political &s;ect, thus incorporated, and thus provided for, will have a political tendency, of a
<PB N="16" REF="027782_0019_0FD63FAB036E72D0">
nature preci&s;ely &s;imilar. No di&s;tinction exi&s;ts between the cau&s;es, and none therefore will appear in the effects. And if it be &s;aid, that our <HI>political rights</HI> are not worth pre&s;erving, let it be remembered that they are the <HI>&s;ole guardians</HI> of religious liberty.</P>
<P>If the ari&s;tocratical &s;ect, thus incorporated, had ac|tually depo&s;ited &s;pecie in their bank, it would yet have remained in their own cu&s;tody, and under their own direction; for the corporation manages its own con|cerns. Even in this event, labour would have been taxed, to pay to the rich an exorbitant u&s;urious inte|re&s;t, for their own money, in their own pockets, and at their own di&s;po&s;al. But u&s;ury upon actual money, was too &s;low a proce&s;s for effecting a va&s;t di&s;proportion of wealth. The contrivance is calculated to be&s;tow upon the rich, intere&s;t upon the amount of their cre|dit, not of their ca&s;h. Bank-paper is circulated to an amount, far beyond a depo&s;it in money. It re&s;ts upon an idea called credit. And all intere&s;t gotten for this &s;urplus of paper, beyond a &s;pecie depo&s;it, is paid by labour to the rich, becau&s;e they have, what the poor ardently wi&s;h for; and therefore they ought not to be taxed for wanting it, &s;ince this precludes even a hope of &s;uch an acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>How delu&s;ive is a compari&s;on between bank-debts, and private loans? The latter mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of money or mo|ney's worth, and without one, debts between individuals cannot be created; the former may be created, though the bank po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es neither money or money's worth, and a banker may live upon the labour of others during his whole life, if he can conceal the fraud of his being a bankrupt. The latter are limited within rea&s;onable bounds, becau&s;e they are founded on real wealth, which cannot be even doubted by impre&s;&s;ing hireoglyphicks upon paper; the former may be infinitely multiplied by a printing pre&s;s, and are unlimited &s;o long as the nation is able to pay &s;ix pounds &s;pecie, for every hun|dred pounds of idea, which a bank may be plea&s;ed to
<PB N="17" REF="027782_0020_0FD63FAF39316738">
emit. In the latter ca&s;e, &s;omething is given for &s;ome|thing; in the former, the community pays &s;omething for nothing.</P>
<P>But a feature of this mon&s;trous contrivance is now to be di&s;clo&s;ed, which expo&s;es the partiality of admi|ni&s;tration to a moneyed intere&s;t, and its real de&s;ign, beyond a remnant of doubt.</P>
<P>This &s;ame wor&s;hipful ari&s;tocracy, favoured of go|vernment, for the bulk of their bank-&s;tock, were not even obliged to depo&s;it money. Public &s;ecurities car|rying an intere&s;t of &s;ix per centum, for three fourths of the whole amount, are by law receivable as a depo&s;it. If actual &s;pecie had been locked up in the vaults of the bank, to be occa&s;ionally counted by public autho|rity, a &s;emblance of an excu&s;e might have been made, by urging, that the intere&s;t of the money thus depo|&s;ited, was lo&s;t. But <HI>paper certificates</HI> are depo&s;ited as a fund upon which to circulate other paper certificates. The&s;e are gaining of the public a never <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> intere&s;t, whether kept by the body corporate, or the individuals compo&s;ing the body corporate. What an unheard of degree of political iniquity is here di&s;clo&s;ed? To the &s;ix per centum paid by government on &s;even millions five hundred thou&s;and dollars of the public debt, is &s;uperadded by mini&s;terial contrivance, the cu&s;tomary profit gained by a bank, and the unu&s;ual acqui&s;itions, ama&s;&s;ed by this particular &s;cheme. Legi&s;lative power it&s;elf cannot a&s;certain, to what the&s;e amount. If they extend only to &s;ix per centum, then twelve per centum is received out of the public labour, by certificate-holders to the amount of 7,500,000 dollars, &s;ome of whom may po&s;&s;ibly po&s;&s;e&s;s no other merit, but the fraud of having purcha&s;ed them of the true owners, by con|cealing their knowledge of the mini&s;terial de&s;igns.</P>
<P>A depo&s;it of paper, as a fund on the credit of which to i&s;&s;ue other paper, is a ruinous feature, exhibited in no other &s;cheme of the &s;ort extant, except that of the
<PB N="18" REF="027782_0021_0FD63FB0E943C438">
United States. Hence the poor compen&s;ation to the public, of locking up &s;pecie in the bank ready for an urgency, in lieu of that taken out of circulation, though pretended, does not exi&s;t. In&s;tead of &s;upporting the credit of government, government mu&s;t &s;upport the cre|dit of the bank. For if the credit of the government wavers, public paper cannot &s;upport the credit of the bank. When government &s;hall need help, the bank will need it al&s;o; nor can the political evils re&s;ulting from being compleatly &s;tript of the <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial</HI> means of defence, be alleviated by unlocking a hoard of paper certificates. If the bank had really collected the &s;pecie into its vaults, government would have been rendered dependent on a private corporation, for the means of national defence. If the bank &s;hould di&s;approve of de|fence, it would withhold the means. Thus it would have become the arbiter of peace and war, and in ca&s;e a combination of foreign potentates, &s;hould endeavour to impo&s;e on America a government of king, lords, and prelates, what would have been the arbitrament of a cla&s;s, from whence tho&s;e materials mu&s;t have been taken?</P>
<P>Banking in its <HI>be&s;t</HI> view, is only a fraud, whereby la|bour &s;uffers the impo&s;ition of paying an intere&s;t on the circulating medium; whereas if &s;pecie only circulated, the medium would in pa&s;&s;ing among the rich, often lie in the pockets of the ari&s;tocracy without gaining an in|tere&s;t. But the ari&s;tocracy, as cunning as rapacious, have contrived this device, to inflict upon labour a tax, con|&s;tantly working for their emolument, whil&s;t they al&s;o retain the chief u&s;e of the ca&s;h, and &s;eldom part with its cu&s;tody.</P>

<P>THE profits of the bank are then a tax upon the community. But a mi&s;erable excu&s;e for this pub|lic impo&s;ition is urged, in the a&s;&s;ertion that it is volun|tary. The <HI>effects</HI> are the &s;ame, whether it is paid willingly or unwillingly. Labour is deprived of its hard earned fruits. A portion of the&s;e is gotten from it, and be&s;towed upon ea&s;e and affluence. The lo&s;s is the &s;ame, whether a daring robber, extorts your pro|perty with his pi&s;tol at your brea&s;t, or whether a mid|night thief &s;ecretly filches it away. Are my misfortunes palliated, becau&s;e I cannot unravel the fraud by which they were brought upon me?</P>
<P>A wi&s;e nation and an hone&s;t man, will view with contempt an apology, founded in a di&s;tinction between &s;ecret fraud and open violence.</P>
<P>Mi&s;erable as the excu&s;e is, it is not true. Labour which pays the tax, has no volition, or even agency in the tran&s;action. It being e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, labour mu&s;t pay it of nece&s;&s;ity, becau&s;e the law enables the rich, to tran&s;mute the circulating coin of the nation, to their own paper money, bearing an intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The immediate dealers with the bank, do not pay the tax, as hath been proved. If reimbur&s;ement had not followed their advance of it, inevitable ruin mu&s;t have en&s;ued, and a general bankruptcy of the deal|ers, would have annihilated the traffic.</P>
<P>A corporation of merchants, and of the rich, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing an unlimited monopoly of the great ma&s;s of the circulating medium, can rai&s;e or dimini&s;h the price of all
<PB N="20" REF="027782_0023_0FD63FB3E5BC5EB0">
commodities, and in this enormous power is contained an unlimited &s;cope, not only for reimbur&s;ement, but for profit. Now, labour produces, and pays for the con&s;umption of all commodities, and out of commodi|ties both the reimbur&s;ements and profits ari&s;es. The bank is a clo&s;e party in this monopoli&s;ing con&s;piracy, becau&s;e its own intere&s;t is combined with the de&s;igns of the immediate dealers, by two indi&s;&s;oluble links. 1&s;t. They are the collectors of the tax the bank receives. 2d. Without reimbur&s;ement they would fail; an in&s;tant lo&s;s would thence fall upon the bank, and the crafts-men would in future loo&s;e al&s;o, the gain of printing pictures for the Ephe&s;ians.</P>
<P>Even a lottery has ever been con&s;idered by the Bri|ti&s;h parliament, as an article of the ways and means for rai&s;ing a national revenue. The purcha&s;e of a ticket is really voluntary, but this was never urged as an excu&s;e for be&s;towing its annual product on a corpo|ration, or for excluding it from the catalogue of taxes.</P>
<P>If the fact had &s;upported the excu&s;e, it might have been illu&s;trated by a compari&s;on. When the Pope was &s;elling his <HI>paper indulgencies</HI> over all Europe, did it not operate as a tax? Did it not enrich the church and im|poveri&s;h the laity? And was the fraud ju&s;tifiable, be|cau&s;e it was <HI>voluntarily</HI> &s;ubmitted to; If &s;o, let us join in one general condemnation of our ance&s;tors, for rid|ding them&s;elves of the impo&s;ition. If not, &s;hall we tolerate a political papacy, which is eternally &s;elling its <HI>paper indulgencies</HI> to our ruin, and their own emolu|ment! E&s;pecially as it is ea&s;ier to detect a fraud, pre|tending to be the di&s;pen&s;er of temporal advantages, than to explode a promi&s;e of eternal happine&s;s. The prie&s;thood in both ca&s;es put on my&s;tery, the vail of prie&s;tcraft, and in both call in the aid of excom|munication. In one an opponent was branded with the epithet of heretic, and excluded from the pale of the church; in the other, antifederal is vociferated, drowns argument, and excludes from civil offices.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="027782_0024_0FD63FB54EEF93F0">
But the fal&s;hood of the excu&s;e will appear, from an a&s;&s;imilation of the bank tax to the impo&s;t. The merchants who advance the impo&s;t, do not pay it. Re|imbur&s;ement, and often with a profit on the advance, is received by them from labour. Is the impo&s;t a vo|luntary or a nece&s;&s;ary tax? The bank-tax is higher upon the capital, than the impo&s;t. The capitals of all the banks now operating, probably exceed the whole a|mount of foreign articles imported, and their annual profits, the whole amount of the annual impo&s;t. Had the mercantile intere&s;t exclu&s;ively borne the burthen of the impo&s;t, would it not have been unju&s;t and ruinous? Does this intere&s;t bear a heavier tax, without complaint or ruin? If not, who does? Both con&s;titute national burthens indi&s;tingui&s;hable in their effects, for neither can be paid but by a national effort; yet more than half of the total is received by private individuals. If no occa&s;ion for the impo&s;t had exi&s;ted, could it con&s;titutionally have been impo&s;ed for twenty years, and be&s;towed upon private per&s;ons, for the ble&s;&s;ed national purpo&s;e of creating an ari&s;tocracy?</P>
<P>All taxation is limited by the ability of the nation to pay. Ability is labour. Whatever of it fruits be|yond its &s;u&s;tenance, labour can &s;pare, is ability. An hone&s;t policy leaves to labour which earned it, as much of this ability, as is not rendered indi&s;pen&s;able by a real national nece&s;&s;ity. A di&s;hone&s;t policy compri&s;es its principles in its motto. It exclaims "A national debt is a national ble&s;&s;ing," and it filches all it can get. In private life, an individual is de&s;ervedly dete&s;ted, who grinds the face of the poor, for the purpo&s;e of buying power, influence or &s;plendour. Airy trifles, weighed again&s;t moral rectitude! What can be &s;aid of a policy, which grinds a nation for &s;uch objects? It &s;ays for it|&s;elf, "A nation cannot pay too much for an ari&s;to|cracy."</P>
<P>Can a mini&s;ter create a national ability to pay taxes, by paper &s;light of hand, or cunning contrivances? If
<PB N="22" REF="027782_0025_0FD63FB6E7A2AAE0">
he can, &s;uch taxes may not fall on labour. If he can, a poor nation may pay as much as a rich one, or more if its mini&s;ter is mo&s;t cunning. If he can, taxation has no boundary, but may be multiplied as indefinitely as human artifice. Then the be&s;t conjurer is the wi&s;e&s;t mini&s;ter, and it would be right to collect all the tum|blers, &s;light of hand men, and &s;hifters of cups and balls in the nation, into an academy or corporation, for the in&s;truction of a diplomatic corps, who will be matter of a&s;toni&s;hment in the pre&s;ent times, and of wonder in future ages.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e it had been propo&s;ed to Great Britain, when &s;he commenced the &s;ubjugation of America, to erect a debt in the very &s;ame mode, equal to the pre&s;ent amount of circulating bank-paper in America, to have be&s;towed upon her a monopoly of the circulating medi|um&mdash;and to have inve&s;ted her with the profits of the contrivance to all eternity. Would not Great Britain have clo&s;ed with the propo&s;ition? Would not the pro|fits of the banking bu&s;ine&s;s have been to her a conque&s;t? What did &s;he fight for? Tribute. If it had been paid in this way, would it not have impoveri&s;hed America, and enriched Britain? Is not this the direct operation of a tribute? America has defeated a nation, but is &s;ubdued by a corporation. She defended her property again&s;t open violence, to be cheated of it by private fraud. She was too hard for her enemies, but a junto of fal&s;e friends are too hard for her. The bank with|out a pretence of claim upon the community, has found means to occupy the &s;tation preci&s;ely, which Great-Britain was &s;triving to fill.</P>
<P>And if America had &s;ubmitted to pay a tribute to Britain, &s;uch a mode of rai&s;ing it, would have been the wor&s;t po&s;&s;ible tax, which could have been impo&s;ed. No check upon the quantity of paper circulated would have exi&s;ted, except the extent of the national ability to pay for it; and the tax might have been &s;ecretly in|crea&s;ed, by increa&s;ing this paper.

paid to the corporation. Its books are placed by law beyond the reach of legi&s;lative in&s;pection, and an intire union of intere&s;ts, among every member of the junto, is a motive &s;trong enough to produce an increa&s;e of the tax, and a concealment of its extent.</P>
<P>The people have not intru&s;ted the Senate of the United States, with a power of originating money-bills, from a jealou&s;y in the tender ca&s;e of taxation, again&s;t the lea&s;t degree of ari&s;tocratical a&s;cendency. But this ari&s;tocratical corporation, containing no repre&s;entative feature, can increa&s;e or dimini&s;h a tax at plea&s;ure, without the a&s;&s;ent or knowledge of the people. They po&s;&s;e&s;s this important legi&s;lative power, &s;ubject to one only re&s;traint. The quantity of paper is unavoidably limited by the national ability to pay for it. How came this limit to exi&s;t, if the profits of the bank aro&s;e out of paper &s;light of hand, and were not burthen&s;ome upon the national ability? Sceptici&s;m it&s;elf, will no longer deny that they are a tax.</P>
<P>Is this a &s;y&s;tem of national charity? To filch from the poor principalities for the rich, whence princes them&s;elves naturally &s;prout up. Is the religion of re|velation, or the religion of nature, acting as it does by an hidden impul&s;e upon the mind, &s;atisfied with &s;uch charity? Is the tribute due to Ce&s;ar, or are the &s;canty, uncertain, occa&s;ional donations of o&s;tentation, a reim|bur&s;ement for a permanent and growing oppre&s;&s;ion? Is the con&s;cience of this &s;y&s;tem &s;atisfied, by the &s;ub&s;titu|tion of hard gotten private alms, of a penny for each pilfered pound, in the place of political ju&s;tice, which filches nothing?</P>
<P>The maxim "that an individual had better &s;uffer a misfortune, than a whole community," is rever&s;ed, &s;ince the community is &s;acrificed for the emolument of a few individuals. Morals and maxims withdraw from the defence of the contrivance, and a mi&s;con&s;truction of the &s;cripture which &s;aith, "unto every one that hath

<P>AND yet its continuance &s;hall not be commen&s;u|rate with the frauds of a bank. I would not im|po&s;e on my readers an endle&s;s ta&s;k. It is only de&s;ign|ed to &s;elect and exhibit &s;o many of its mi&s;chiefs as will illu&s;trate the admini&s;tration. For this a pamphlet will &s;uffice, whereas a &s;imple vocabulary of its tricks and &s;ins would fill a volume.</P>
<P>The contrivance is now to be exhibited in a point of view yet more alarming. 'Tis the &s;ummit of a climax, &s;ufficient to &s;trike a whole community with con&s;terna|tion.</P>
<P>If a number of the members of Congre&s;s are &s;tock-holders, or bank directors, then an illegitimate intere&s;t is operating on the national legi&s;lature&mdash;then the bank hath &s;educed away from their natural and con&s;titutional allegiance, the repre&s;entatives of the &s;tates&mdash;and then, even foreigners&mdash;our late mo&s;t malignant and inveterate enemy&mdash;have obtained an influence on our national councils, &s;o far as they have obtained bank &s;tock. The Engli&s;h who could not conquer us, may buy us. Fooli&s;h Engli&s;h, to expend an hundred millions in fighting for the power of legi&s;lation, when a twentieth part of the money, will peaceably obtain it by purcha&s;e! But you have &s;een your error, whereas we are entering into ours.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e for argument &s;ake, that a majority of &s;uch members did not exi&s;t. It is owing only to the curte&s;y of the &s;cheme, &s;ince in addition to the &s;tockholders, the bank could elect all its directors out of Congre&s;s, of which it regularly gives us &s;ix &s;amples, three in each hou&s;e. And more it would elect, if more it needed, for
<PB N="25" REF="027782_0028_0FD63FBDA04B1318">
there is no con&s;titutional or legal re&s;traint upon its oc|ca&s;ions. To what an humble &s;tation hath the American legi&s;lature dwindled down, within four years of its crea|tion; its independency is held by curte&s;y of a corpora|tion: And an admini&s;tration will call it&s;elf federal, and a lover of liberty, when it has de&s;troyed its fundamental principle.</P>
<P>An exclu&s;ive private intere&s;t, too often outweighs a common public obligation. What we can enjoy alone we value mo&s;t, and are mo&s;t eager to attain. Each man's &s;hare of liberty, is held in &s;o general a partner&s;hip, that it is often di&s;regarded, under a &s;tronger inducement. It cannot be depo&s;ited in a vault, nor will it produce him an enormous annuity in hard money.</P>
<P>Hence when paper men get into Congre&s;s, or mem|bers are metamorpho&s;ed into paper men after they get there, it is obvious that they will be influenced by their per&s;onal private intere&s;t, producing them an immen&s;e profit in ca&s;h, rather than the public good. If the latter &s;uffers, they will con&s;ider their own acqui&s;itions in money, as a kind of boot, compen&s;ating them abundant|ly for their portions of the common lo&s;s. One partner may thrive and the re&s;t be ruined. And upon &s;uch prin|ciples it is, that exclu&s;ions from the legi&s;lature are ju&s;ti|fied.</P>
<P>That an abundance of paper men have been in Con|gre&s;s, can never be denied. An unnatural alliance exi&s;ts between certificate and &s;tockholders; unnatural, as I &s;hall take occa&s;ion to &s;hew. But the interpo&s;ition of a third power will often reconcile contradictions, and a &s;overeign hath been known to manage two kingdoms, of different languages.</P>
<P>The public money is lodged in the bank. The higher the taxes are, the more of this money is therein depo&s;ited. The more of this money is depo&s;ited in the bank, the more paper the bank can circulate on its credit, and the
<PB N="26" REF="027782_0029_0FD63FBF701AAE98">
greater will be its profits. If the bank will &s;tick by a mini|&s;ter, a mini&s;ter may &s;tick by a bank. The amount of taxes and loans are propo&s;ed by the mini&s;ter's e&s;timates. When the&s;e get into Congre&s;s, they meet with a great number of paper men, who have a private intere&s;t in the accumulation of public burthens, and thus e&s;cape the &s;trict di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, to be expected from unbia&s;&s;ed repre&s;en|tatives. If a mini&s;ter &s;hould in this way douceur the bank and member-&s;tockholders, the bank and &s;uch mem|bers may in &s;ome other douceur him and his friends. Occa&s;ional accommodations of money, operating to ac|quire an influence in Congre&s;s, may be ea&s;ily obtained by means of a good under&s;tanding, and a good under|&s;tanding is ea&s;ily formed between good friends, united by the &s;tronge&s;t of all ties&mdash;mutual &s;upport.</P>
<P>And mutual &s;upport is nece&s;&s;ary. The egregious impo&s;itions of a bank, cannot expect a long continuance, but by the help of mini&s;terial influence; and mini&s;terial influence re&s;ts, for its &s;upport, on paper evolutions. They are partners in a game, knowing each other's hands, and playing into them. Let us win the public money, &s;ays the bank, and you &s;hall certainly win an ari|&s;tocracy out of the &s;tockholders. Be&s;ides you may &s;catter the public money in the bank and its branches, from Bo&s;ton to Charle&s;ton, &s;o that it never can be counted; perplex your &s;tatements, &s;o that nobody can under&s;tand them, and we can always bring you off without detection, by boa&s;ting of an intuitive knowledge, or inward light, making the whole matter as pellucid as the meridian &s;un. Our votes in Congre&s;s count as well as others.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that po&s;&s;ibilities are here &s;tated. When facts are a&s;&s;erted, they re&s;ult from the &s;tatute book, or are of public notoriety. Apprehen&s;ions are hazarded, for the purpo&s;e of &s;ubmiting it to the public mine, whether it will remain expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger, or rid it&s;elf of &s;o di&s;quieting a &s;ituation, by &s;ubjoining new checks for the recovery of
<PB N="27" REF="027782_0030_0FD63FC074252AB8">
violated rights, and the re&s;traint of uncon&s;titutional de|&s;igns. Such would be only an expo&s;ition of the con&s;ti|tution, which never contemplated a &s;y&s;tem &s;triking at the root of liberty.</P>
<P>A nation ri&s;ks too much, by laying heaps of public wealth in the way of her &s;ervants, which they may take up, and put in their pockets, without being &s;een, and without account. Such trials of integrity, involve too &s;erious and fatal con&s;equences for national amu&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>A part of the paper &s;y&s;tem, as the mini&s;ter hath pub|licly announced, contemplated the introduction of foreigners into the American &s;peculations&mdash;Con&s;ider the effect of this. Paper men get into Congre&s;s, and go|vern the legi&s;lature&mdash;The bank governs the paper men&mdash;A majority of &s;tockholders govern the bank&mdash;And foreigners may con&s;titute this majority&mdash;Therefore fo|reigners may guide the legi&s;lature of America. Every great national que&s;tion may be influenced by them. Is a treaty to be made re&s;pecting commerce or territory&mdash;are regulations concerning trade under con&s;ideration&mdash;or is a propo&s;ition for aboli&s;hing banks and &s;tockjobbing to be decided upon, and a Briti&s;h influence may po&s;&s;ibly give the ca&s;ting vote in every que&s;tion. If the que&s;tion &s;hould relate to a war with Britain, the public &s;ituation would be ab&s;olutely farcical. Specie being expelled by bank paper, a war could not be carried on, but by the help of &s;uch paper. A majority of the &s;tock may be held by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, who would be more likely to embarra&s;s public mea&s;ures, by demanding the debt due to the bank, into which the nation is already plunged, than to furni&s;h the means of attacking them|&s;elves. What a train of humiliating reflections are &s;ugge&s;ted by this idea? Forbear to indulge your grief. Let an effeminate impre&s;&s;ion be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by a manly re&s;olution, to lend your aid in de&s;troying a &s;y&s;tem, by which even Britain may be better repre&s;ented in Con|gre&s;s, and have more influence in the great que&s;tion of peace or war, than any &s;ingle &s;tate.</P>

The paper &s;y&s;tem po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more than a pre&s;idential or tribunitial veto. The&s;e were only powers of prevention, or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. Whereas the paper &s;y&s;tem in its majo|rity, hath acquired that tempting power, for which Britain wa&s;ted her blood and trea&s;ure in vain, "of bind|ing us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever."</P>
<P>Pau&s;e reader, and awfully recollect, that the govern|ment is in the hands of &s;peculators. Is an inordinate love of money, a proper principle for legi&s;lators or ma|gi&s;trates of any kind?

<HEAD>SECTION VII.&mdash;THE FOREGOING FACTS APPLIED TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE INVESTIGATION.</HEAD>
<P>BUT it is nece&s;&s;ary to unload the memory, before we proceed farther, by an application of the facts which have been di&s;clo&s;ed and impre&s;&s;ed, to the text which was &s;elected as a guide for our enquiries.</P>
<P>It was a&s;&s;umed as a po&s;ition, "That the con&s;titution contemplates a republican form of government, flowing from, and depending on the people, and that a mode of admini&s;tration de&s;tructive of &s;uch dependence, and introductory of <HI>monarchical ingredients,</HI> innovates upon, and &s;ubverts the con&s;titution."</P>
<P>Now let me a&s;k, whether an ari&s;tocracy, is not only an ingredient, but the harbinger of monarchy? In this view it is unimportant to decide, whether the profits of the bank, are actually a tax upon the people or not. It is enough for our purpo&s;e, that the in&s;titution tends
<PB N="29" REF="027782_0032_0FD63FC36EA6C790">
to accumulate great wealth in the hands of a few indi|viduals; and that it is only calculated for the admi&s;&s;ion of the rich. Nor is it nece&s;&s;ary here to contend, that it acts with double force, in continually reducing the poor, whil&s;t it is exalting the rich.</P>
<P>Let me further demand, what con&s;titutes a real ari&s;|tocracy? Names, or wealth united with exclu&s;ive pri|vileges. America recoils again&s;t titles. A con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this, hath arre&s;ted a propo&s;ition in the Senate for their introduction, which, it is &s;aid, came from a mem|ber of Virginia, in violation of the &s;entiment of that &s;tate, and remains yet, to be decided upon when occa|&s;ion &s;hall be ripe. Though the Senate did not dare to pa&s;s it, they could not bear to reject it. Is it not puerile to &s;purn at the &s;hadow, whil&s;t we erect by law the &s;ub|&s;tance? Which is mo&s;t to be dreaded; titles without wealth, or exorbitant wealth without titles? Have the <HI>words,</HI> prince, lord, <HI>highne&s;s</HI> or <HI>protector,</HI> a magical in|fluence upon our minds, or can they lay a &s;pell upon our exertions? The mo&s;t honorable and be&s;t earned title exi&s;ting (and to the propriety even of this, I do not mean to &s;ub&s;cribe) is that of the Cincinnati. This title does neither influence the legi&s;lature, nor plunder labour. Who are mo&s;t to be dreaded, the <HI>nominal</HI> or <HI>real</HI> lords of America? It is evident that exorbitant wealth con&s;titutes the &s;ub&s;tance and danger of ari&s;tocra|cy. Money, in a &s;tate of civilization is power. If we execrate the &s;hadow, what epithet is too hard for an admini&s;tration, which is labouring to introduce the &s;ub|&s;tance? The &s;hadow is an ugly, yet harmle&s;s picture, fit only to frighten children; the fell mon&s;ter it&s;elf is good cau&s;e of alarm to men. In a land of liberty, the picture di&s;gu&s;ts, though incapable of doing mi&s;chief, and is therefore excluded. Shall we con&s;ult our &s;en&s;a|tions, and yet neglect our &s;afety? Whil&s;t the con&s;titu|tion inhibits a nobility even <HI>nominally,</HI> are its principles permi&s;&s;ive of its erection <HI>in reality?</HI> Does it reject the <HI>term</HI> "murder," and yet allow the crime to be perpe|trated?</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="027782_0033_0FD63FC4F0442F98">
A democratic republic is endangered by an immen&s;e di&s;proportion in wealth. In a &s;tate of nature, enor|mous &s;trength po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by one or &s;everal individuals, would con&s;titute a monarchy, or an ari&s;tocracy&mdash;in a &s;tate of civilization, &s;imilar con&s;equences will re&s;ult from enormous wealth. But the deity &s;eems to have indicated his will in favour of liberty, by equali&s;ing the one, and limiting the other. The acqui&s;itions of an <HI>hone&s;t indu&s;try</HI> can &s;eldom become dangerous to public or private happine&s;s, whereas the accumulations of <HI>fraud</HI> or <HI>violence,</HI> con&s;tantly dimini&s;h both. And providence vi&s;ibly expre&s;&s;es its di&s;approbation of &s;uch attempts, by rai&s;ing up an extravagant heir to di&s;&s;ipate ill-gotten and di&s;proportionate wealth; a <HI>natural effect,</HI> of which ari&s;|tocracies are &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that they con&s;tantly counteract it by artificial regulations, e&s;tabli&s;hing perpetuities.</P>
<P>Tyrants and &s;laves&mdash;an ari&s;tocracy enormou&s;ly rich, and a pea&s;antry wretchedly poor, approximate in morals. Is it from a &s;ociety thus compo&s;ed, that the ble&s;&s;ings of political morality are expected to re&s;ult? The compo|&s;ition is &s;tealing upon us like death. The bank is the time of the body politic. It will lead it immaturely to the decrepitude of old age, and de&s;ert it in the hour of di&s;&s;olution. Is this a direction for a wi&s;e people to pro|ceed in? If the community will madly pre&s;s forward to this goal, the &s;ooner &s;he arrives the better; there Phoe|nix-like &s;he will expire, with a con&s;olatory hope that a &s;ounder offspring will ari&s;e out of her a&s;hes.</P>
<P>A mini&s;ter intoxicated with influence, will exclaim, "Public debt is a public ble&s;&s;ing," for taxes are an in|citement to indu&s;try. Where does the con&s;titution con|template an influential character in the per&s;on of a Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, entitling him to pre&s;cribe to Congre&s;s political dogmas? Or whence ari&s;es the right of the federal government, to apply &s;timulants to indu&s;|try? Does the con&s;titution inve&s;t it with &s;uch a power; if &s;o, what is become of the liberty of labour? A whore will admini&s;ter provocatives to lu&s;t, by the rule of her

own in&s;atiable appetite, and not the ability of her para|mour; and when his &s;trength and health are exhau&s;ted, will de&s;ert him with contempt. Did labour intend to plan it&s;elf under the whip of an avaricious, in&s;atiable, and luxurious ari&s;tocracy?</P>
<P>Labour, in the erection of a government, after deduc|ting the nece&s;&s;ary expence of &s;upporting it, de&s;igned to &s;ecure &s;afety to it&s;elf, in the enjoyment of its own fruits. The &s;timulating &s;y&s;tem fru&s;trates this object, and changes government into its ma&s;ter, brandi&s;hing the la&s;h of legi&s;|lation, and leaving to labour what mea&s;ure of &s;u&s;tenance it plea&s;es. In&s;tead of the owners &s;paring to government, government &s;pares to the owners. The &s;y&s;tem it is true, will make men le&s;s indu&s;trious in the pre&s;ervation of liberty. An urgent pre&s;&s;ure for food and raiment, is un|likely to in&s;til into the mind the liberal &s;entiments of freedom. A bea&s;t of burthen is more remarkable for its patience than its &s;pirit. An ari&s;tocracy, therefore have good rea&s;on to exclaim "a national debt is a na|tional ble&s;&s;ing," and in pur&s;uance of their maxim, to create one that is fictitious, payable to them&s;elves out of the hard earned fruits of labour. To them it is a mine, yielding gold without work. By loading labour with &s;timulants, a coinage for their u&s;e is continually proceed|ing, and a tame and broken &s;pirited &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the im|po&s;ition, will be effectually &s;ecured.</P>
<P>A nation oppre&s;&s;ed by debt, real or fictitious, is a na|tion of &s;laves.</P>
<P>The plebians of this age are too wi&s;e to be individually cozened by the patricians, &s;o that the latter are obliged to create a fictitious debt, by the help of law, impo&s;ing generally upon the former, both an u&s;urious and com|pound intere&s;t. It is time to retreat to the &s;acred mount, if no other expedient is left, and there a&s;&s;ert the rights of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But perhaps benevolence is at the bottom of this bank|ing contrivance, and though the ari&s;tocracy are &s;purring
<PB N="32" REF="027782_0035_0FD63FC75CB1C788">
up labour to indu&s;try, by large annual draughts from its product, they may entertain a &s;ecret purpo&s;e of making an unexpected re&s;toration of the&s;e draughts to the true owners. A &s;urpri&s;e &s;o agreeable, would create a day of jubilee, and perhaps the community, in its hour of good humour, might pre&s;ent the &s;everal banks with a continuation of their charters, provided they would thenceforward pay all the expences of government.&mdash;But what a degree of prodigality would it be, to farm out a revenue for half its annual product?</P>
<P>The &s;econd propo&s;ition a&s;&s;umed, was, "that Congre&s;s can impo&s;e taxes for the common defence and general welfare of the United States, but not for the benefit of individuals, or their own private emolument."</P>
<P>Although in applying the facts to the fir&s;t propo&s;i|tion, it was not nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ert, that the profits of the bank are &s;ub&s;tantially a tax, yet we mu&s;t now re|collect the arguments urged to prove it, and rely that they have left on the mind of the reader an indelible conviction.</P>
<P>And then it follows, that the mo&s;t alarming infringe|ment of the con&s;titution, in the mo&s;t dangerous and tender point, exi&s;ts in the bank law.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e recollected, &s;ubjoin another argument. Banks, all confe&s;s, bani&s;h &s;pecie. It is the nature of &s;pecie to equalize it&s;elf throughout the commercial world, and therefore whatever is bani&s;hed from any country, creates a <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> pro tanto. This <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> can only be &s;upplied by &s;ome <HI>&s;ub&s;titute,</HI> and bank paper is with us the only &s;ub&s;titute. The nation therefore, by the contrivance, is <HI>compelled</HI> either to &s;uffer the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> or re&s;ort to the <HI>&s;ub&s;titute.</HI> If the lo&s;s re&s;ulting from the want of a circulating medium, is greater than the price demanded by the bank for its paper, people are impelled by the motive of intere&s;t to buy it. A want is artifici|ally created, producing an alternative, con&s;i&s;ting, on both &s;ides, of evil; the bank calculating, that of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="33" REF="027782_0036_0FD63FCAC0268748">
evils, the lea&s;t would be cho&s;en. When all the <HI>circulating</HI> &s;pecie is bani&s;hed, the nation <HI>mu&s;t</HI> pay for the whole of its <HI>circulating</HI> medium. If a part, they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> pay for &s;o much as will &s;upply that part. In proportion as a bank can inflict on the community, the misfortune of lo&s;ing its circulating &s;pecie, will its profit accumulate. A total lo&s;s, the depth of misfortune to the one, is the &s;ummit of pro&s;perity to the other. In an affair of the utmo&s;t national con&s;equence, the intere&s;t of a corpo|ration, and the intere&s;t of the nation, are preci&s;ely in oppo&s;ition, and the affair is managed exclu&s;ively by the corporation. So long as there is &s;pecie enough for the national occa&s;ions, bank paper will bear no price, or but little can be &s;old. Is not a pre&s;&s;ing <HI>need,</HI> a tax? An impo&s;t is founded on a <HI>need</HI> for imported articles. Home manufactures or forbearance, may evade it. Which will pre&s;s mo&s;t, the <HI>need</HI> for imported articles, or for a circulating medium, and how is the latter to be evaded?</P>
<P>Life and property, are the two great objects of hu|man &s;olicitude. Government &s;eldom delights in hu|man blood, and hence our &s;afety on that &s;core. But its bowels often yearn for human wealth. Checks again&s;t this unhappy inclination, are con&s;idered as the mo&s;t important, and are the mo&s;t numerous in our con|&s;titution. It exhibits a degree of caution, amounting to &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Of what avail are the&s;e checks, if they are to be eva+ded by mere names? In&s;tead of u&s;ing the word "tax," the word "bank," is re&s;orted to. Suppo&s;e the title of the law had been, <Q>An act for rai&s;ing an annual &s;upply of money for public purpo&s;es, by the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of a bank.</Q> Would the money rai&s;ed have been a tax? Or, &s;uppo&s;e the law had been en|titled, <Q>An act for taxing the community by the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of a bank, and dividing the money &s;o rai&s;ed,
<PB N="34" REF="027782_0037_0FD63FCC895177B0">
among &s;undry members of Congre&s;s, and certain other individuals therein named.</Q> This title preci&s;ely fits the law as it &s;tands, and as it operates.</P>
<P>What then has become of the con&s;titution? The rai|&s;ing of money is the e&s;&s;ence of a tax law; this act rai&s;es money, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the e&s;&s;ence, though not the name. Sundry members of the legi&s;lature who impo&s;e the tax, receive a portion of it, and private individuals the re|&s;idue. How does this redound to the <HI>common defence,</HI> or <HI>general welfare</HI> of the United States?</P>
<P>In a &s;tamp act, the word "tax," might be avoided, and that contrivance might be as con&s;titutionally re|&s;orted to, for the emolument of Congre&s;s and com|pany.</P>
<P>And if a depo&s;it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, permit me to &s;ugge&s;t an admirable hint. By the bank law, three fourths of the depo&s;it, might con&s;i&s;t of certificates, which are evidences of a depo&s;it, heretofore made for public &s;ervice. When a depo&s;it of the&s;e is made in the bank, an evidence is received of this &s;econd depo&s;it. Let this &s;econd evidence be depo&s;ited, as &s;tock in the &s;tamp-office, and a third evidence taken out. Erect a new contrivance, where this third evidence may be depo&s;ited as &s;tock al&s;o, and &s;o on <HI>ad infinitum.</HI> For the one fourth &s;pecie depo&s;ited in the bank, the proprietors do not probably now gain a profit, of above <HI>cent. per cent.</HI> Whereas one or two other depo&s;itories of <HI>evidence</HI> as <HI>&s;tock,</HI> will produce an appreciating effect, the rever&s;e of the depreciating operations during the late war. Or the idea will be better exemplified, by reminding my readers of doubling the grains of corn, for every nail on a hor&s;e's &s;hoe. This &s;imilitude will fit at both ends. It exhibits the &s;tock nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et out with, and al&s;o the gainfulne&s;s of &s;uch operations.</P>

<P>Can you po&s;&s;ibly, reader, comprehend a difference between the good of bank directors and &s;tock holders, and the good of the community? Are the burthens and profits of this corporation, the burthens and profits of the nation? May not the good of the one, be the harm of the other? And may not a &s;tockholding bank-direc|ting member of Congre&s;s, legi&s;late har<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the one, that he may &s;hare in the good with the other?</P>
<P>Rea&s;oning, to prove &s;elf evident propo&s;itions, though apparently &s;uperfluous, may yet be nece&s;&s;ary by way of parapet, to defend them again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of overbear|ing wealth and power.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution, thoroughly impre&s;&s;ed with the opi|nion, that a &s;imilitude of intere&s;ts, of burthens, of be|nefits, and even of habits, between the people and their repre&s;entatives, was e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the mainte|nance of liberty, and the di&s;pen&s;ation of civil happine&s;s, re&s;orts to numerous precautions for its attainment.</P>
<P>Having this end in view, it pre&s;cribes,</P>
<P N="1">1. That no per&s;on &s;hall be a repre&s;entative, who has not been &s;even years a citizen of the United States.</P>
<P N="2">2. That each repre&s;entative, mu&s;t be an inhabitant of the &s;tate in which he is cho&s;en.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="36" REF="027782_0039_0FD63FCFCB288D58">
3. That the repre&s;entation &s;hall be in proportion to numbers.</P>
<P N="4">4. That no repre&s;entative &s;hall be appointed to any office created, or the emoluments whereof have been increa&s;ed, during the period for which he was elected; and that no per&s;on holding an office &s;hall be a repre|&s;entative.</P>
<P>The purpo&s;e of the&s;e fundamental rules, was to &s;e|cure a legitimate legi&s;lature, by excluding every &s;pecies of undue influence then fore&s;een.</P>
<P>The idea of a bank, does not appear to have been contemplated or di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the minute&s;t degree by the convention which framed the con&s;titution. And not a trace of &s;uch an idea, is to be found in the in&s;trument re&s;ulting from their deliberations.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who argue in favour of the con&s;titutionality of the corporation, are reduced to the narrow ground of a&s;&s;erting, that a power is tacitly implied, conflicting and &s;ubverting the mo&s;t fundamental principles, earne&s;tly and loudly expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Con&s;tructive powers, are like con&s;tructive trea&s;ons. Have we &s;ecured our lives again&s;t the latter, and left our property, which &s;upports life, expo&s;ed to the for|mer?</P>
<P>From the bank contrivance, the following infractions of the cleare&s;t con&s;titutional principles, obviou&s;ly en&s;ue.</P>
<P N="1">1. Members of Congre&s;s may vote for the erection of a <HI>gainful</HI> project, and be the <HI>receivers</HI> of the gain.</P>
<P N="2">2. They may impo&s;e a tax on the community or a a part of it, and in&s;tead of &s;haring in the burthen, &s;hare in the plunder.</P>
<P N="3">3. The higher and more unnece&s;&s;ary the taxes and loans are, the more public money will be depo&s;ited in the bank, and the greater will be the profit of the bank-members
<PB N="37" REF="027782_0040_0FD63FD109E700F0">
of Congre&s;s, who neverthele&s;s vote for taxes and loans.</P>
<P N="4">4. A member of Congre&s;s, debauched by a profit|able banking intere&s;t, cea&s;es to be a <HI>citizen</HI> of the U|nion, or an <HI>inhabitant</HI> of the &s;tate which choo&s;es him, <HI>as to the purpo&s;es</HI> of the con&s;titution. He becomes a citizen, and inhabitant of Carpenters Hall.</P>
<P N="5">5. Being a member of a corporation, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly or in part of foreigners, he is more under the influence of foreigners, than of tho&s;e who elected him.</P>
<P N="6">6. The con&s;titution aims at a <HI>real</HI> repre&s;entation of the &s;tates in proportion to numbers, making no pro|vi&s;ion for members from corporations; and yet if the members of this corporation keep their &s;eats in con|gre&s;s, it is moderate to a&s;&s;ert that it will be better re|pre&s;ented than any &s;tate. For &s;urely it will be admit|ed, that a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es as much fidelity to his own intere&s;t, as to the intere&s;t of his con&s;tituents. And hence the evident &s;truggle in the con&s;titution to &s;ecure a common intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. The bank can only gain its repre&s;entation, by &s;e|ducing the repre&s;entatives of the &s;tates from their natu|ral allegiance; thus a &s;tate may be deprived of the whole or a part of her repre&s;entation, and the appor|tionment according to numbers is defeated. It would be better to allow the bank members, than to permit it to plunder the &s;tates of their &s;everal quotas.</P>
<P N="8">8. It was evidently de&s;igned, that the Senate as judges of impeachments, &s;hould be <HI>con&s;titutionally</HI> pre&s;erved in a &s;tate of impartiality. Impeachments originate in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and the crimes to be re|&s;trained by this proce&s;s, will mo&s;tly be compri&s;ed in a mi&s;application of public money. But if tho&s;e who are to inquire into &s;uch mi&s;applications, to impeach, and to decide upon impeachments, may in con&s;equence of
<PB N="38" REF="027782_0041_0FD63FD3746A8C70">
banking and paper &s;y&s;tems, be gainers by the mi&s;appli|cations, it is obvious that the check provided by this article of the con&s;titution, upon a &s;pecies of criminali|ty, &s;o dangerous as to have attracted the particular attention of a general convention, is intirely defeated. If accomplices are to &s;et enquiries on foot,&mdash;to accu&s;e&mdash;and to decide, no prophetical &s;pirit is nece&s;&s;ary to fore&s;ee the deci&s;ion. Can a contrivance be con&s;titu|tional, by which a judiciary, the power of which ex|tends even to the puni&s;hment of undefined crimes, may be influenced out of its integrity and independence? The fountain of ju&s;tice ought to be pure and uncorrupt. An influence which may &s;way a fearful tribunal, not only for the acquital of the guilty, but for the condem|nation of the innocent, was never contemplated by the con&s;titution. Bank directors, &s;tock holders, and a pa|per intere&s;t, may be more likely by their judgments to di&s;qualify hone&s;t patriots from holding, "any office of honour, tru&s;t or profit under the United States," who &s;hall ob&s;truct peculations from public labour in any &s;hape, than to remedy frauds favouring a monied in|tere&s;t in general, and accruing to their own emolument in particular. A tribunal, which may try a pre&s;ident, ought to be as free from &s;u&s;picion, as Cae&s;ars wife.</P>
<P>But leaving an endle&s;s enumeration of con&s;titutional violations, we will adventure a general ob&s;ervation; that the contrivance is a vehicle of undue influence, ope|rating &s;en&s;ibly, and often irre&s;i&s;tibly, upon almo&s;t every important que&s;tion which can occur in Congre&s;s. It remains with the community to decide whether the impul&s;e tends to their good, and whether, if it does not, government is not converted into an u&s;urpation, in one of its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential qualities?</P>
<P>Members of Congre&s;s, who are al&s;o members of the bank, are under a triple bondage. If they di&s;plea&s;e the mini&s;ter, he may not only le&s;&s;en the trade in public mo|ney, which the bank now monopoli&s;es, but he may re|move
<PB N="39" REF="027782_0042_0FD63FD523283E80">
the money to another place of depo&s;it, and he may refu&s;e the in&s;titution his &s;upporting influence, when its con&s;titutionality is que&s;tioned. The mini&s;ter is by law, let into a con&s;iderable portion of bank &s;ecrets. This knowledge is a conjurer's wand, with which the &s;pirits may be rai&s;ed or exorci&s;ed, ju&s;t as the magician plea&s;es. Such repre&s;entatives, whil&s;t they are making laws to govern a nation, are them&s;elves liable to laws enacted by a corporation; for the bank can make bye laws. And if the national laws do not plea&s;e the cor|poration, it may revenge it&s;elf through the medium of its bye laws, upon the national repre&s;entatives for en|acting them. But a colli&s;ion of this kind is not likely to happen, as a common intere&s;t guides the corporation collectively and individually. A third ma&s;ter, the pub|lic intere&s;t pre&s;ents it&s;elf. It does not offer the influ|ential ela&s;tic, which the others can liberally be&s;tow, and is to maintain a combat at the odds of two to one. No bondage is &s;o &s;eldom rebelled again&s;t, as one which produces money. Mankind daily &s;ell their be&s;t &s;ervices and exertions, and the highe&s;t bidder is u&s;ually the pur|cha&s;er.</P>
<P>The bank realizes the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation upon a member of Congre&s;s. He goes one thing, and by admini&s;tering to him quantum &s;ufficit of paper, he is converted to another. A tran&s;ub&s;tantiated or vir|tual legi&s;lature, was ju&s;t what the Engli&s;h de&s;igned to impo&s;e on America. In what part of the con&s;titution is a doctrine &s;anctioned, which ju&s;tifies the epithet of rebel, be&s;towed during the war by the enemy, upon tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed &s;uch a legi&s;lature?</P>
<P>If the bank&mdash;the paper &s;y&s;tem&mdash;and the mini&s;ter, can influence a majority of the members of Congre&s;s, or even a &s;ingle member, where are &s;uch repre&s;enta|tives of the &s;tates, as are clearly contemplated by the con&s;titution? Again&s;t the evil not a &s;ingle check exi&s;ts. Influence is a courtly term for corruption. It is never
<PB N="40" REF="027782_0043_0FD63FD7B2090178">
nece&s;&s;ary to induce a national repre&s;entation, to pur&s;ue the national good. And although it is only u&s;ed, for the purpo&s;e of obtaining exclu&s;ive benefits for the few at the expence of the many, yet the few, counting up|on the reconciliation to abu&s;es, produced by habit, will &s;oon begin to in&s;inuate, that influence, alias, corrup|tion, is an indi&s;pen&s;able attribute of good government.</P>
<P>Even &s;chool boys ridicule and contemn the corrup|tion which guides the Briti&s;h parliament, according to the will of a mini&s;ter. They have &s;ufficient penetra|tion to di&s;cern, that the &s;y&s;tem is a cheat, exhibiting the picture of liberty, in lieu of the &s;ub&s;tance. Com|pare the two ca&s;es, and point out, if you can, a differ|ence.</P>
<P>Antient and modern tyranny have re&s;orted to differ|ent modes for effecting the &s;ame end. The former, unpracti&s;ed in the arts of di&s;&s;imulation, u&s;ed open vio|lence. The latter, &s;kilful in deception, has changed the old &s;y&s;tem, and re&s;orts to the wily tricks of private influence. One depended upon downright fighting, and an action in the open field, generally proclaimed the tyrant; the other prefers the general&s;hip of fi&s;cal ambu&s;cade, and the tyrant is often concealed from pub|lic view, long after he is de&s;potic. A defeat could on|ly de&s;troy the one, but a detection may over&s;et the o|ther. Search, and you will inevitably find a pre&s;ent acting u&s;urpation; for if the proceedings of govern|ment are incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of the con&s;ti|tution, there is nothing to ju&s;tify them.</P>
<P>Slavery, when impo&s;ed by antient ambition, was &s;oftened by a military genero&s;ity of di&s;po&s;ition; but from the modern &s;ordid, money-loving meanne&s;s of mind, what melioration can be expected?</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IX.&mdash;THE FUNDING SYSTEM.</HEAD>
<P>IT hath pa&s;&s;ed, irrevocably pa&s;&s;ed. Being compound|ed of materials originally hone&s;t, and con&s;i&s;ting at this time in a great mea&s;ure of &s;uch materials, it is pro|bably impo&s;&s;ible to unravel and remedy the intermedi|ate fraud.</P>
<P>It remains however an indelible hieroglyphic of the principles and de&s;igns of admini&s;tration, and in that view de&s;erves to be decyphered.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who framed the &s;y&s;tem, was certainly ca|pable of contemplating, and of guiding its effects. Had a motive of impartiality and public good pre&s;ided at its formation, the &s;everal &s;tates, the commercial, the a|gricultural, mechanical and profe&s;&s;ional intere&s;ts, all of which are too bu&s;ily engaged in a variety of <HI>u&s;eful</HI> oc|cupations, to hunt out mini&s;terial &s;ecrets, would have been plainly forewarned of the de&s;ign, and publicly cautioned to pre&s;erve their paper property. But this would have violated the mini&s;terial de&s;igns. It would have obviated the contemplated intention, of erecting an enormous ari&s;tocracy or monied intere&s;t, becau&s;e the public debt, like other property, would have remain|ed con&s;iderably di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was and is the fa&s;hion of thinking, that a public debt unequally held, gives permanency and weight to government. That is, to u&s;e plain terms, it will ena|ble government to controul the will of the people, by counterbalancing it with the weight of wealth. The con&s;titution is compiled upon a principle preci&s;ely in op|po&s;ition to this idea. The &s;overeignty of the people gave it birth, and it acknowledges their parental au|thority. This is a de&s;ign of a few individuals, exclu|&s;ively to appropriate to them&s;elves the management of the national offspring, that they may change its nature, and debauch its affections from the great object of its
<PB N="42" REF="027782_0045_0FD63FDAACCBE928">
political duty. It is an attempt to tran&s;plant the con&s;ti|tution from democratic ground, in which it might flou|ri&s;h, to an ari&s;tocratical &s;oil, in which it mu&s;t peri&s;h.</P>
<P>And hence the funding &s;y&s;tem. It was &s;o contrived as to enable &s;peculators and monied men, to defraud the great bulk of the community of their paper proper|ty. As to transfer it, from tho&s;e who earned it, to tho&s;e who pilfered it, either by &s;ugge&s;ting fal&s;ehoods or concealing truths. As to concentrate it in a few hands, &s;o that it could be applied with impre&s;&s;ion, and po&s;&s;e&s;s activity as a political machine. And as to leave the true owners, by way of retribution for their pro|perty, a burthen&s;ome tax.</P>
<P>Speculators could calculate events in Congre&s;s. They had lei&s;ure to pry into accounts. They could even interpret the &s;ilence of a mini&s;ter by watching indica|tions. Silence, was a negative con&s;ecration of the un|informed multitude to the lu&s;t of rapacity. A general, taking a city, condemns it to be plundered, if he does not actively interpo&s;e for its protection.</P>
<P>The nation, but ju&s;t emerged from the unfore&s;een misfortunes of paper money, are &s;uddenly overwhelmed by the ruin of a paper policy. The <HI>accidental</HI> bril|liancy of paper acqui&s;itions, gave the hint for a <HI>&s;y&s;tem.</HI> It &s;et out with the plau&s;ible pretence of curing an evil, and it applies a wor&s;e evil. As if fire would cure a burn. The wounds &s;uffered by individuals, from paper money, were healing; but an accidental misfortune is now converted into a &s;y&s;tem, by which a few individuals &s;peculate on a nation; the old wounds are made to bleed afre&s;h, and new ones are indi&s;criminately inflict|ed.</P>
<P>Of this &s;y&s;tem, the a&s;&s;umption is a &s;triking feature. For this there was no general petition from the people. No urgency pre&s;&s;ed it. But it favoured the object of
<PB N="43" REF="027782_0046_0FD63FDF2DC9B5D0">
admini&s;tration. State debts &s;old at a low rate, and therefore might ea&s;ily be monopolized. To di&s;&s;olve all money relation&s;hip, between individuals, and the &s;epa|rate &s;tates, would on the one hand dimini&s;h the &s;tate power, and tend to con&s;olidation, and on the other cre|ate an undue influence, by which the con&s;olidated pow|er might be managed.</P>
<P>If the payment of public debts had been an object, accident had already effected, that which &s;uch a mo|tive would have dictated. Congre&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of indirect, and the States that of direct taxation. Hence the public debt could have been diffu&s;ed upon the re|&s;ources of the nation, &s;o as to have been le&s;s burthen|&s;ome upon an exclu&s;ive branch of tho&s;e re&s;ources, by leaving the States re&s;pectively to provide for State debts. And an impo&s;t might have been equivalent to tho&s;e of the union.</P>
<P>A recurrence to direct taxation by Congre&s;s, will &s;wallow up the little &s;overeignty, now left to the once &s;overeign individual States; and every accumulation of the debts of the union, is an impul&s;e towards that end.</P>
<P>Hence all a&s;&s;umptions, and hence the enormous loans which have been negociated. In the power of money, is the confidence of admini&s;tration placed. By a&s;&s;uming all money negociations, a face of bu&s;ine&s;s, and activity, will be be&s;towed on the Federal govern|ment. The exclu&s;ive payment of debts, and impo&s;ition of taxes, will exhibit it as the only political object, to intere&s;t the attention of individuals; whil&s;t the &s;tate governments will become only &s;peculative common|wealths, to be read for amu&s;ement like Harring|ton's Oceana, or Moore's Utopia. Without pul&s;ation, without ela&s;ticity they will dwindle gradually into a tale that has been told, and their parts will crumble and di&s;&s;ipate, like a corporation of beavers, who&s;e waters have been drained away.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="027782_0047_0FD63FE1A198FF78">
Does this &s;y&s;tem comport with the con&s;titution, where it guarantees to each State a republican form of govern|ment: If the term <HI>"form,"</HI> means <HI>&s;hadow,</HI> it does; but if the guarantee extends to <HI>&s;ub&s;tance,</HI> we may bold|ly a&s;&s;ert, that it does not.</P>
<P>A money &s;y&s;tem may be called the natural enemy of State con&s;titutions&mdash;of State laws&mdash;of State police (for we dare not a&s;pire to an higher expre&s;&s;ion) and of State di&s;po&s;itions.

A few dwarfs are &s;uddenly metamorpho&s;ed into giants, by a paper necro|mancy, and the re&s;t of the community whom it makes more dwarfi&s;h, both really and comparatively, are in|chanted by &s;yren notes, into an in&s;en&s;ibility of their dan|ger.</P>

<P>A lineament of the &s;y&s;tem, is al&s;o exhibited in the &s;inking fund. Even its name was a fraud upon the community.

<P><PB N="45" REF="027782_0048_0FD63FE1A497C088">
The &s;inking fund was erected <HI>in</HI> 1790, con&s;i&s;ting of about 1,300,000 dollars, which the mini&s;ter <HI>then</HI> re|ported, as a <HI>&s;urplus</HI> of revenue, beyond the public oc|ca&s;ions.

Was the mini&s;ter &s;o wide of the truth, when he called the &s;inking fund <HI>"a &s;urplus,"</HI> as to have been obliged to divert both that, and monies borrowed, for the <HI>pre&s;cribed</HI> purpo&s;e of pay|ing the French debt, to current governmental occa|&s;ions? or were no certificates to be purcha&s;ed?</P>
<P>But if keeping up, or rai&s;ing the price of certificates be con&s;idered as the primary object, all the&s;e difficulties are &s;olved.

<P>The re&s;emblance between monarchical or ari&s;tocra|tical contrivances, and the admini&s;tration of the govern|ment, is not le&s;&s;ened, by playing off upon America, the Engli&s;h bubble of a &s;inking fund. When theirs was e&s;tabli&s;hed, their debt was moderate, but &s;ince this &s;pe|cies of fund hath been operating, it has &s;welled to a|bove three hundred millions of pounds &s;terling. Under the operation of our &s;inking fund, the public debt, has been continually accumulating al&s;o, and a proportional augmentation, will undoubtedly in le&s;s than a century, enable us to contend with England it&s;elf, for the fir&s;t rank among the honourable &s;ociety of national &s;pend|thrifts.</P>
<P>The aera when the government began to act, was the moment of lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion. At that unwary moment, an <HI>u&s;urping</HI> &s;y&s;tem could be mo&s;t &s;afely introduced, and precedents for expounding the con&s;titution e&s;tabli&s;hed, which might be afterwards quoted. Relying upon the unlimited national confidence which then exi&s;ted, the &s;y&s;tem dictated an attempt to bind future legi&s;latures, and to &s;ecure perpetually to the nation the <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of a public debt, by rendering a great proportion of it ir|redeemable. The con&s;titution limits the power of Con|gre&s;s "to the <HI>payment</HI> of the debts of the United States," and whil&s;t the echo of the mandate is yet vi|brating in our ears, the funding &s;y&s;tem declares that they &s;hall <HI>not be paid.</HI> What barrier, will not rapaci|ty and ambition overleap?</P>
<P>Funding, banking, a&s;&s;uming, loaning, have compi|led a fi&s;cal and political perplexity. The fi&s;cal, which could mo&s;t ea&s;ily have been explained, &s;ince figures can exhibit an account of money, is not even under&s;tood by the members of Congre&s;s. And the political, though better under&s;tood, is &s;till a capital auxiliary towards the

general ob&s;curity. <HI>Perplexity</HI> in money &s;tatements is ground enough for &s;u&s;picion. Detection would expel &s;u&s;picion to make room for certainty. And the want of &s;implicity in politics, is ever a badge of de&s;ign.</P>

<P>And hence the tone of this in&s;trument al&s;o, in its &s;e|veral vibrations, harmonizes with the perilous de&s;ign, radically to de&s;troy the con&s;titution, and to erect upon its ruins an u&s;urpation, not &s;anctioned by the national will, or acknowledging the fundamental principle; <HI>that the people are the only legitimate fountain of civil government.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECTION X.&mdash;THE REMEDY.</HEAD>
<P>TO determine whether a remedy to the&s;e threatening evils is nece&s;&s;ary or not, the inquiry ought to be brought to the following &s;imple point. Whether Ame|rica is now governed according to the &s;y&s;tem of the con|&s;titution, or the &s;y&s;tem of an admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>This latter &s;y&s;tem is indeed a riddle, but its effects furni&s;h the &s;olution. By its fruits &s;hall it be known. Effects are the language in which a political de&s;ign &s;peaks, and furni&s;h a con&s;truction, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing <HI>profe&s;&s;ions</HI> in veracity, as far as the permanency of things, ex|ceeds that of words.</P>
<P>If the con&s;titution meditates the producing of great
<PB N="48" REF="027782_0051_0FD63FE9E6BF8A58">
inequality of wealth among citizens&mdash;the enriching of a favoured few at the public expence&mdash;the impo&s;ition of an enormous tax for private benefit, and not for the ge|neral welfare&mdash;the e&s;tabli&s;hment of corporations, with gainful rights and privileges, which nece&s;&s;arily dimi|ni&s;h the general &s;tock of rights and privileges, from whence they are deducted&mdash;the transferring of the pa|per property of the citizens into a few hands without value received&mdash;the erection of a fund, under a pre|tence of &s;inking the public debt, whereas its true de|&s;ign was to rai&s;e the value of that very paper, thus filch|ed from the real owners, at the public expence&mdash;the rendering the debt of the United States irredeemable by law&mdash;the giving to foreigners an immen&s;e, indirect and &s;ecret influence over our national coun&s;els&mdash;and above all, the introduction of a monied and undue influence into the legi&s;lature; an influence which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts at the public expence, in&s;tead of being actuated by the public good; if the con&s;titution meditates &s;uch de&s;igns, then the point is determined one way, and it mu&s;t be conce|ded that America is governed according to the con&s;titu|tion; if it does not, candor will acknowledge, that A|merica is governed according to a &s;y&s;tem of an admini|&s;tration.</P>
<P>To come at the truth, &s;earch our political &s;cripture, con&s;ider it text by text, and di&s;cover where the&s;e de&s;igns have been &s;o covertly concealed, as to have e&s;caped the penetration of every convention which &s;ifted and con&s;i|dered the in&s;trument; and as to remain a monument of a trea&s;onable intention in the general convention, to de|ceive and impo&s;e upon their con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>If we rely on the united integrity and wi&s;dom of Ame|rica, we &s;hall reject over&s;trained con&s;tructions, tending to impeach the&s;e qualities, and &s;eek for the plain and con&s;i&s;tent meaning.</P>
<P>After having a&s;certained the principles of the con&s;ti|tution, let it be con&s;idered, whether the &s;y&s;tem of the
<PB N="49" REF="027782_0052_0FD63FEB2DB2E9E0">
admini&s;tration may not be overturned, and the con&s;titu|tion &s;till remain unhurt? If &s;o, is not that &s;y&s;tem a vi|olation of the con&s;titution?</P>
<P>Then it ought to be de&s;troyed. America has a&s;&s;um|ed a character upon the theatre of the world, which ho|nour&mdash;fame and political philo&s;ophy, call upon her to &s;upport. She is the inventor of principles, a&s;&s;erting the equal rights of man, and exploding king-craft, prie&s;t-craft, nobility-craft and mini&s;ter-craft. It is in|cumbent upon her to prove by example, that her the|ory is practically &s;ound. Otherwi&s;e &s;he betrays man|kind, after having con&s;tituted her&s;elf the vindicator of their rights. In&s;tead of honour, &s;he will then de&s;erve reproach; and her future fame will be that of a gene|ral Arnold for in&s;tance, who has betrayed the cau&s;e he undertook to defend, and de&s;erted over to the ene|my he engaged to defeat.</P>
<P>A divi&s;ion of power among king, lords, and com|mons, is &s;etting out in government with an allotment of parties. It is providing the materials for civil di&s;&s;en|tion. Power will fluctuate like wealth, if it is propo&s;ed as the &s;ubject of controver&s;y among three contending intere&s;ts. And every fluctuation mu&s;t di&s;order the fanciful idea of the <HI>balance.</HI> A preci&s;e equipoi&s;e among the&s;e three intere&s;ts, from which only the pub|lic good is expected to re&s;ult, could not exi&s;t above a moment in an age. Whereas by taking the people as the only genuine and legitimate fountain of power, and by avoiding legal artifices producing an inequality of wealth or privileges, we e&s;cape the black train of evils recorded in hi&s;tory, as having been in mo&s;t ages and governments, engendered by combinations of nobles to oppre&s;s the people; and by more ju&s;tifiable combina|tions of the people to reduce the nobles. Evils, which are the natural effect of the whim&s;ical balancing notion, and which invariably end in de&s;poti&s;m. Nobility is the cau&s;e of the&s;e evils, and of cour&s;e the &s;eed of tyranny.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="027782_0053_0FD63FECAEA7FC28">
As a rival&s;hip for power, is the uniform con&s;equence of three branches of government, it mu&s;t inevitably de|&s;troy the balance, and produce a continual political fermentation. And the conte&s;t will not be allayed by reflecting, that tho&s;e for who&s;e good the &s;cheme is &s;aid to have been invented, are &s;ure of being degraded to the de&s;picable &s;tate of a mere tool, to be u&s;ed by ambi|tion and artifice, for the attainment of their own &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The people are the natural body politic; king, lords and commons, are artificial &s;tructures. Tho&s;e who fa|vour art at the expence of nature, con&s;ider the people as a mere ma&s;s of matter, upon parts of which they ex|ert a pla&s;tic political-craft, and form a &s;ort of intaglio. The re&s;idue of the ma&s;s is con&s;idered only as a &s;tore|hou&s;e of materials, to mend, patch, and &s;upport the &s;e|lected or &s;ecreted parts, as they happen to impair each other by their colli&s;ions.</P>
<P>King, lords and commons are a fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of an admiral &s;hip, fir&s;t rates and frigates, and the people are the fore&s;ts, out of which this fleet is built and re|paired; to be cut, hacked and hewed, as the occa&s;ions of the fleet &s;hall require. Further by way of accommo|dating my&s;elf to tho&s;e poi&s;ing ideas; the people in &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, may be likened to a balance ma&s;ter, &s;tag|gering about with a ladder upon his chin, a chair mounted on the ladder, and a &s;word on the chair. Can the equilibration be long &s;u&s;tained? In&s;tead of &s;uch mountebank pantomimes, is it not advi&s;able, le&s;t they fall upon you, to &s;lip from under them, and &s;o let all three fall to the ground. And then, a natural po&s;i|tion, which only can produce &s;tability, may be re&s;um|ed.</P>
<P>This balancing whim hath been tried by many nations, and if all have failed either to find or maintain the ba|lance, it is time to conclude, that it is an attempt to put
<PB N="51" REF="027782_0054_0FD63FF2BB62BA70">
fetters on air, or a &s;earch after the philo&s;opher's &s;tone. That it is founded in &s;peculation and not in principle. That the idea of forming a government by the help of a pair of &s;cales, con&s;tructed for weighing power, is more fanciful than &s;olid. And that the multiplied examples of tho&s;e who have failed, ought to deter the &s;lighte&s;t degree of prudence, from renewing an experiment, invariably un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>By adhering to the idea, that the people are the only genuine fountain of power, a con&s;titution is immortal; for if a <HI>change</HI> is made in its parts by the public will, it only proves that this <HI>fundamental</HI> principle continues unimpaired. Such would be a plain con&s;titution, not poi|&s;oned by the drugs of a &s;peculating policy. A change of times, temper, and circum&s;tances, may often require a change of political regulations. By clinging to this &s;imple principle, a peculiar &s;ituation may be gratified, without internal commotion; whereas a <HI>mixed</HI> prin|ciple&mdash;a political &s;almagundi, is &s;eldom brought back to its primitive parts but by a civil war.</P>
<P>Who is to &s;uperintend the political tripod? If a member of it is from time to time to adju&s;t the weights, he will be for ever filching from the other two, to add to his own &s;cale. Thus the equilibrium is lo&s;t and then the effects of the machine are wide of every calcu|lation.</P>
<P>The perplexity of this mechani&s;m requires frequent repairs, and yet its delicacy makes it un&s;afe to mend it. Whereas from &s;implicity, both &s;trength and duration, are mo&s;t likely to re&s;ult.</P>
<P>The preci&s;e adju&s;tment of the&s;e balances, is an at|tainment, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing human intellectual powers, as far as the preci&s;e a&s;certainment of the true religion. As to both, no two per&s;ons would hardly agree in every par|ticular, and when there are as many opinions as there
<PB N="52" REF="027782_0055_0FD63FF49C125338">
are men, what is the chance for &s;tumbling on the right? Sincerity in political <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, will not render its con&s;e|quences to &s;ociety le&s;s baneful.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the graces&mdash;the graces, may be per|petually rung in our ears, but conveying no per&s;picu|ous idea, the manners it will produce can never be fore&s;een; and if one in a thou&s;and &s;ucceeds, all he ac|quires is a &s;pecies of ceremonious tin&s;elled frippery of ge&s;ture of little worth either to him&s;elf or others; whereas a deportment, founded in moral rectitude, is the ba&s;is of individual happine&s;s, and the di&s;pen&s;er of ble&s;&s;ings to others. The balances&mdash;the balances, are the graces&mdash;the graces of government. They are a confu&s;ed a&s;&s;emblage of notions, conveying no di&s;tinct idea, and compo&s;ed by the rule of fancy. The prin|ciple, <Q>that the people are the only legitimate foun|tain of power,</Q> and of cour&s;e the only &s;afe corrector of its abu&s;e, is a political guide, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the one in point of public &s;afety, as far as true morality exceeds the other in re&s;pect to private manners.</P>
<P>Obvious is the vanity of an expectation, that one equal con&s;tituent member of a government, is a &s;ufficient and &s;afe check upon two others; as is the folly of depo&s;it|ing all &s;ocial and natural rights, under a &s;teward-&s;hip, as unre&s;trained, as if the proprietors had travelled into a far country. Whether is it mo&s;t likely, that one member will enter on the perilous undertaking of con|trouling the wicked de&s;igns of the other two, or that motives of intere&s;t and &s;afety &s;hould dictate to all, the policy of a triple alliance? The example of Great Bri|tain carries this idea beyond conjecture.</P>
<P>Can the majority of the people de&s;ign to oppre&s;s? Does hi&s;tory exhibit &s;uch a ca&s;e? The writers in favour of monarchy are reduced to the mi&s;erable &s;hift, of &s;ub|&s;tituting the mobs of cities in the place of nations, in order to conjure up the idea of a popular de&s;poti&s;m, which cannot, as America is &s;ituated, exi&s;t. The many
<PB N="53" REF="027782_0056_0FD63FF77AC983C8">
have no motive to oppre&s;s the few. Temptations to fraud are in an inver&s;e proportion, to the multitude who are &s;harers in the plunder, and the diminution of the booty to be divided. A combination of the great bulk of the community, to erect a de&s;poti&s;m over an in|con&s;iderable number of individuals, though it would not exhibit the extreme ca&s;e, of a tyrannic nation, do|mineering over one man, would yet pre&s;ent the ridi|culous object, of an hundred per&s;ons, owning a &s;ingle &s;lave.</P>
<P>But whither are we going? Did America fight for a revolution of dominating families, or of principles? If of principles define and compare them with the &s;enti|ments now avowed, by words, in books, in new&s;|papers, and by actions, all evincing a concerted de&s;ign. Seriou&s;ly concerted as the de&s;ign is, I will believe that America is not &s;ufficiently regenerated, for the intro|duction of king, lords and commons. She yet knows well, that <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> religions&mdash;bi&s;hops&mdash;tythes&mdash;and &s;tanding armies, being &s;cions of the &s;ame &s;tock, ine|vitably &s;prout up together with ari&s;tocracy.</P>

<P>THE people are the only &s;afe guardians of their own liberty. The component parts of government are the creatures of the con&s;titution. A &s;ubjection of the cre|ator to the created, is a rever&s;al of the cour&s;e of nature. The con&s;titution is a limitation to legi&s;lative power. It in&s;ulates arbitrary de&s;igns, and continually pronounces, "thus far &s;halt thou go." But &s;uppo&s;e a legi&s;lature &s;hould go further. Is the veto abortive? Is it only an empty
<PB N="54" REF="027782_0057_0FD63FF8DAB7DBE8">
echo of a nation's la&s;t dying words? or is it to be en|forced and by whom?</P>
<P>Without legi&s;lative encroachment or connivance, no infringement upon the con&s;titution can happen. The laws will act upon and re&s;train individuals, by the en|forcement of the courts of ju&s;tice; but the con&s;titution only can act upon the legi&s;lature, by the enforcement of the &s;ocial juri&s;diction. The laws being competent to every other object of good government, the con&s;ti|tution mu&s;t have been exclu&s;ively de&s;igned for the ca&s;e, to which it is now applied. Until a violation of the principles of the con&s;titution appears, no occa&s;ion for re&s;orting to the remedy exi&s;ts; and when it does ap|pear, to a&s;&s;ert that there is no mode of getting at the remedy, or that the body pre&s;uppo&s;ed by the violation, to be vitiated, are yet to enforce it upon them&s;elves, is making the con&s;titution a dead letter.</P>
<P>Therefore if liberty is a national object, the nation it&s;elf mu&s;t watch over the con&s;titution, pre&s;erve it from violation, and &s;upply its defects, or admit it to be the Lethe of the community, producing an intire forgetful|ne&s;s of the rights of man.</P>
<P>The national judgment or will may be brought to act in two modes, without recurring to a general con|vention.</P>
<P N="1">1. By cautiou&s;ly electing members of Congre&s;s, of a &s;imilarity of intere&s;ts&mdash;of burthens&mdash;of benefits&mdash;and of habits with the electors. For an unbia&s;&s;ed judgment upon good information, will correct political abu&s;es, and invent new checks again&s;t their repetition.</P>
<P N="2">2. Through the organs of &s;tate legi&s;latures.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t will operate &s;lowly. The people may be deceived by profe&s;&s;ions, and a repre&s;entative though &s;ound at fir&s;t is &s;ometimes debauched. But yet as the
<PB N="55" REF="027782_0058_0FD63FFB22DA5148">
people when informed, are almo&s;t invariably right, and as a repre&s;entative is often firm, it de&s;erves the mo&s;t &s;edulous attention.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is a &s;ecurity for liberty of the happie&s;t texture which could have been devi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;tate legi&s;latures are the people them&s;elves in a &s;tate of refinement, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uperior information, and exhibiting the national &s;uffrage in the faire&s;t and &s;afe&s;t mode.</P>
<P>They are annual conventions, &s;ubject to no undue in|fluence, not participating of loaves and fi&s;hes, and actua|ted by the motive of public good.</P>
<P>Holding their power by an annual tenure, they are frequently accountable to the people, often changed, and incapable of forming combinations for their private emolument, at the public expence.</P>
<P>Being more immediately within the view of their con|&s;tituents, &s;hould they mi&s;interpret the doings of the national government, or mi&s;repre&s;ent the public mind, a detection, or a contradiction, would be almo&s;t in&s;tan|taneous.</P>
<P>As electors of &s;enators, they con&s;titute a chief link connecting the general and &s;tate governments, through which the conduct of the former may be better under|&s;tood, and the will of the people reacted; &s;o as to fill up in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the great &s;pace between Congre&s;s and the people.</P>
<P><HI>They may operate deci&s;ively upon the general govern|ment, by con&s;tituting the &s;enate according to a republican &s;tandard.</HI></P>
<P>And finally the &s;tate legi&s;latures have at lea&s;t as good a right to judge of every infraction of the con&s;titution, as Congre&s;s it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="027782_0059_0FD63FFCD0847C30">
The alarming mode of thinking avowed by the ari&s;to|cracy, <Q>that they are only re&s;pon&s;ible to God and their own con&s;ciences,</Q> in&s;tead of weakening the argument, is an additional rea&s;on for clinging to every means, tend|ing to produce an <HI>effectual</HI> re&s;pon&s;ibility in the mem|bers of Congre&s;s, to the con&s;titution, and to the people who made it. Whil&s;t the avowal goes to the &s;ubver|&s;ion of every principle of liberty&mdash;to the annihilation of the con&s;titution&mdash;and is in fact a rebellion again&s;t the fir&s;t principles of liberty, the <HI>act</HI> of &s;hutting the &s;enate doors accords with the <HI>doctrine,</HI> and exhibits one of its effects, by ob&s;tructing the evidence upon which a re|&s;pon&s;ibility can only be enforced. If a juri&s;diction is compelled to decide upon incomplete evidence, a power to impo&s;e &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity, in&s;tead of being amenable to that juri&s;diction, is &s;uperior to it; and by concealing a part, a&s;&s;umes a right of with-holding the whole te&s;timo|ny. Of what avail is a right of deci&s;ion, when the grounds upon which to exert human rea&s;on and reflec|tion, are with-held either completely or partially?</P>

<P>Again. Public monies are to be accounted for to Congre&s;s. Suppo&s;e they &s;hould be employed in favori|ti&s;m to the bank, or in keeping up the price of certifi|cates. Will certificate or &s;tock-holders, who receive the money, be very inexorable in detecting and puni&s;h|ing &s;uch a mi&s;application? Or being bound by number|le&s;s ties of the &s;tronge&s;t intere&s;t, in the clo&s;e&s;t alliance with a mini&s;ter of finance, is not an explanatory and en|lightening effect upon their minds rather to be expect|ed,

if incomprehen&s;ible accounts of public monies &s;hould be exhibited.</P>
<P>It is the <HI>chief principle</HI> of the con&s;titution, that the natural, and not an artificial intere&s;t, &s;hould be repre|&s;ented in the legi&s;lature. They are u&s;ually in oppo&s;ition to, if not at enmity with, each other; becau&s;e the lat|ter con&s;tantly &s;ub&s;i&s;ts upon the former. Therefore the lat|ter, ought to be limited and re&s;trained by the &s;imple rule of the public good. But if it legi&s;lates, it is &s;ubjec|ted to no re&s;traint or limitation.</P>
<P>Slavery is only a domination of an artificial, over the natural intere&s;t of a nation. In whatever &s;hape that ar|tificial intere&s;t appears, the effect is the &s;ame. And if the artificial intere&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a power of erecting it&s;elf, and of legi&s;lating to pre&s;erve and &s;upport it&s;elf, the na|tion is already en&s;laved.</P>
<P>Public creditors and &s;tock-holders ought to be ex|cluded from Congre&s;s, upon the &s;ame principle as pub|lic officers are excluded, becau&s;e all may acquire pub|lic monies by their own votes, and the acqui&s;iti|ons of the two former being behind the curtain, are mo&s;t to be apprehended. Would &s;uch characters have been fit per&s;ons to form a con&s;titution for America, and if not, are they proper guardians, of that which they could not have been entru&s;ted to enact?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e for in&s;tance, whil&s;t the funding and a&s;&s;ump|tion laws were under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, members of Congre&s;s had held paper, the value of which was to be greatly enhanced by funding and a&s;&s;uming. Would &s;uch mem|bers have been impartial judges of the propriety of the&s;e mea&s;ures? or of the propo&s;ition to make &s;ome re|tribution to the original holders for their lo&s;s, leaving &s;till to the purcha&s;ers a hand&s;ome gratuity? Could not members of Congre&s;s upon that occa&s;ion have been in|terwoven by &s;peculators, with their projects? Or whil&s;t the que&s;tions were under con&s;ideration, if members had

drawn the wages paid by their country for impartiality, and inve&s;ted them in the purcha&s;e of a per&s;onal intere&s;t on one &s;ide of the que&s;tion, could a greater degree of legi&s;lative corruption have been conceived? When the bank law was before Congre&s;s, were certificate holders impartial legi&s;lators, &s;ince an effect of it, was to increa&s;e the intere&s;t on 7,500,000 dollars of certificates, from &s;ix to at lea&s;t <HI>twelve per centum?</HI></P>
<P>Illu&s;trations re&s;ulting from an actual &s;tate of things, and drawn from laws, &s;o important in their con&s;e|quences, enable us to look forward for future effects, upon better grounds than conjecture, and bring the que&s;tion to this i&s;&s;ue. Ought Congre&s;s to decide upon the mo&s;t important national regulations, from motives of public good, or ought they to be governed, or even bia&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e of private intere&s;t?</P>
<P>Natural deafne&s;s would be con&s;idered as an unan|&s;werable objection to a candidate for a &s;eat in Congre&s;s, and yet it would be preferable to an artificial deafne&s;s, as far as an equal chance of doing right, is preferable to an automaton member, who&s;e motions are governed by a &s;ecret impul&s;e, when that impul&s;e is &s;elf-intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Laws then ought to be made by the natural or gene|ral intere&s;t of a nation, and every artificial, local and particular intere&s;t, ought to depend upon the ju&s;tice and integrity of that which is natural or general, be|cau&s;e of this every individual participates, whereas a few per&s;ons only are concerned in the others; becau&s;e the &s;maller the number, and the more exclu&s;ive the in|tere&s;t, the greater the temptation to inju&s;tice and par|tiality; becau&s;e national confidence in the important matter of legi&s;lation, can only re&s;ide in the nation it&s;elf; and becau&s;e, when a power to legi&s;late, is the offspring of legi&s;lation and not of the con&s;titution, legi&s;lation which gave, can re&s;ume the power, can transfer it from one exclu&s;ive intere&s;t to another, and can cau&s;e politi|cal

principles, intended to be made con&s;titutionally per|manent, to fluctuate. The power of legi&s;lation, by the &s;everal paper laws, is in fact and &s;ub&s;tance (for we are regardle&s;s of form) transferred from the nation to a paper junto. And if the bank and certificate artificial intere&s;ts, were in a &s;tate of warfare, legal transfers of this power, and fluctuations of political principles, would pre&s;ently exemplify the objects of a legi&s;lative power, flowing in fact, though not in form, out of le|gi&s;lation.</P>
<P>If this is not the principle of exclu&s;ions from the le|gi&s;lature, upon what ba&s;is do they re&s;t? Admiting it to be &s;o, is not the artificial, exclu&s;ive, private paper in|tere&s;t completely embraced by it?</P>
<P>When &s;uch an intere&s;t &s;educes a part of the repre|&s;entatives of the general or national intere&s;t, into its views or de&s;igns, liberty is dangerou&s;ly wounded; but when a majority of &s;uch repre&s;entatives is thus &s;e|duced, liberty is theoretically annihilated.</P>
<P>An unan&s;werable illu&s;tration of this doctrine re&s;ults from the recollection, that the paper intere&s;t is tran&s;i|tory. It is a bird of pa&s;&s;age, regardle&s;s of climes, in|capable of national feelings&mdash;of national attachments&mdash;or of that amor patriae, which is the mo&s;t tender pledge of legi&s;lative kindne&s;s. In&s;tead of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing perma|nency, it may connect it&s;elf occa&s;ionally with French, Spani&s;h, Dutch, or Engli&s;h politics. Are the&s;e &s;uch &s;upports as the con&s;titution &s;olicits? And what mu&s;t be the views of an admini&s;tration, which has &s;elected an itinerant, unfeeling vi&s;itant, as the guardian of its de|&s;igns? Of the public good, paper is a mo&s;t unnatural guardian. It is a rapacious calculator of intere&s;t, who&s;e con&s;cience is &s;eared by its acqui&s;itions and its hopes. In Congre&s;s, it is an inexorable creditor, with an execution or a deed of tru&s;t in its hand, ready to &s;eize and &s;ell&mdash;with a power to borrow money for its

own purpo&s;es, at any lo&s;s to the debtor&mdash;and able to perplex its demands and add to its u&s;ury, by &s;ly tricks or legi&s;lative contrivances.</P>
<P>Hence the depo&s;iting of certificates in the national bank, by which the paper more than doubled intere&s;t&mdash;hence the enormous loans made of the bank, carry|ing intere&s;t, whil&s;t it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and u&s;ed an enormous &s;um of public money, carrying no intere&s;t&mdash;hence the continual foreign loans, whil&s;t the nation is amu&s;ed with a &s;inking fund, with compliments to the trade of financiering, and with official recommendations from the mini&s;ter, conveyed through the pure&s;t channel, to commence the di&s;charge of the public debt&mdash;and hence that a&s;&s;emblage of contrivances, placing the people in a &s;tate of utter darkne&s;s, as to the di&s;po&s;ition of their money.</P>
<P>If we tempt men's de&s;ires, by hopes of boundle&s;s ac|qui&s;itions, the con&s;tant incitements of private intere&s;t, will leave no interval of time or reflection, to be ap|propriated to the public good; a reflection, out of which, if it is ju&s;t, ari&s;es a &s;trong argument for expel|ling every &s;pecies of private undue influence out of Congre&s;s, that the attention of this body may be bent to the national welfare.</P>
<P>The expul&s;ion of paper men out of Congre&s;s would bring the&s;e ob&s;ervations to the te&s;t of an impartial le|gitimate legi&s;lature. Is &s;uch an event de&s;irable? An|ticipate it, and behold its effects. If the paper intere&s;t would be expelled from Congre&s;s&mdash;if the incorporating u&s;urpation, and all con&s;tructive contrivances, violating republican principles, would be re&s;trained&mdash;if any other mi&s;con&s;trued or doubtful expre&s;&s;ions in the con&s;titution would be explained, and new &s;ecurities for liberty de|vi&s;ed&mdash;and if &s;implicity in the finances would be en|forced; &s;uch deci&s;ions would prove the truth and ju&s;t|ne&s;s of my arguments.

<P>What! exclaims the appalled ari&s;tocracy, will you al&s;o invade rights of private property, <HI>as by law e&s;ta|bli&s;hed?</HI> Yes, <HI>If they are interdicted by the principles of the con&s;titution, they are wrongs, and not rights.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;ubject de&s;erves a further examination. It may illu&s;trate and unravel the uncon&s;titutional de&s;igns of a monarchical faction.</P>
<P>We hear on all hands of the <HI>&s;acredne&s;s</HI> of private property, held by <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> &s;anction; of the <HI>inviolabi|lity</HI> of <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> faith; and it is even a&s;&s;erted, that Congre&s;s ought never to repeal a law, by which they have be&s;towed a valuable boon upon an individual. Congre&s;s have them&s;elves plainly expre&s;&s;ed their &s;uf|frage in favour of the&s;e doctrines, by pledging the pub|lic faith, that the exclu&s;ive privileges of the bank &s;hall be enjoyed for twenty years <HI>unrivalled,</HI> and by making a portion of the public debt <HI>irredeemable,</HI> in virtue of their con&s;titutional power <HI>to redeem.</HI> It is evident that the&s;e doctrines are invented to prop the laws, and the laws grounded in a contemplation of the doctrines. Whence both the doctrines and the laws are clearly a|&s;cribable to a common &s;ource.</P>
<P>A legi&s;lature influenced by private motives, will ex|alt legi&s;lative &s;anctions, and deba&s;e con&s;titutional barri|ers. Tho&s;e who invent wrongs for their own u&s;e, will al&s;o invent doctrines to &s;upport tho&s;e wrongs.</P>

Combining the doctrine and laws, they engender a di|rect claim by the legi&s;lature, of a power to u&s;urp upon the rights of the nation, Provided, the depredation is &s;old or given to an individual or a corporation. It is a doc|trine which pro&s;trates every con&s;titutional fence, devi|&s;ed, or capable of being devi&s;ed for the pre&s;ervation of liberty and property, at the feet of a legi&s;lature. They may parcel out public property and public rights, which are the only wares they deal in, until none worth having remain. They may endow an ari&s;tocracy at the nation|al expence, and if the inviolability of legi&s;lative faith is to obviate a reclamation, then the ari&s;tocracy is per|petual. Congre&s;s may even di&s;tribute among their ba&s;|tards the revenues of cities, countries or &s;tates in perpe|tuity, through the medium of paper, banks, coals, or any nece&s;&s;ary of life; and an example for it is to be found in a &s;y&s;tem, which is obviou&s;ly the polar &s;tar of the politics of government. Nay they may divide the fruit of the national labour among them&s;elves, not for twenty years only, but for ever. The limitation of the bank tax was merely arbitrary; and if the inviolability of legi&s;lative faith, is to &s;anction the contrivance for twenty years, a precedent exi&s;ts for conveying the whole national ability to a &s;ingle corporation, in tail &s;ucce&s;&s;ional, for all eternity.</P>
<P>This legal immutability, &s;uppo&s;es con&s;titutional mu|tability. Congre&s;s are mounted by it to a pre-emi|nence over a national convention. It goes to the pre|&s;ervation of <HI>legal</HI> wrongs, beyond a revolution it&s;elf. It is an a&s;&s;umption of a power, not actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any exi&s;ting generation of mankind, and which the na|tion it&s;elf could not be&s;tow even on a general conven|tion. It renders con&s;titutional rights <HI>violable,</HI> by a&s;|&s;erting that legal rights are <HI>inviolable;</HI> thus in a man|ner repealing political go&s;pel, by form of law. And is indeed a doctrine &s;o replete with evil and ab&s;urdity, as to have been avowed but &s;eldom, &s;ince the times of the Medes and Per&s;ians.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="027782_0067_0FD6400AB6359810">
But the Medes and Per&s;ians were more con&s;i&s;tent than Congre&s;s. Immutability was a concomitant of their laws univer&s;ally. Whereas with us the whole doctrine is monopoli&s;ed by tho&s;e, who can &s;trip the nation of its wealth or rights by form of law. Laws of this kind are called deeds, and the &s;ign, &s;eal and deliver of Con|gre&s;s, clo&s;es the conveyance for ever. As if all laws did not in &s;ome way affect private per&s;ons. As if to &s;e|cure the nation <HI>individually,</HI> they mu&s;t be plundered <HI>col|lectively.</HI> As if it was a con&s;olation to a man, whom you are about to de&s;troy on one &s;core, to declare him &s;afe as to another.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution empowers, Congre&s;s to make laws, not to make deeds. Mutability is attached to legi&s;la|tion. Otherwi&s;e each &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Congre&s;s would have its power narrowed by the preceding, though derived from the &s;ame &s;ource, and held by the &s;ame tenure. To keep faith to the bank law, we mu&s;t be guilty of a breach of faith to the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>To return more immediately to the &s;ubject. The con&s;titution in the fifth article, recognizes the &s;tate le|gi&s;latures, as &s;tate conventions, and Congre&s;s as a ge|neral convention. Congre&s;s, united with two thirds of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, may alter the con&s;titution. Con|templated, as they are in this important in&s;tance, as the organs of the people, can it be improper for them to make known the public will, or to recon&s;ider emenda|tions of the con&s;titution, of which they are ultimately to judge? The power of forcing Congre&s;s, by the man|date of two thirds, immea&s;urably tran&s;cends a mere re|commendation.</P>
<P>A genuine, impartial, unadulterated legi&s;lature, would fairly con&s;ider, and impartially determine que&s;tions of a national magnitude, exceeded by none. Therefore, the remedies pre&s;enting them&s;elves are;</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIII.&mdash;THE SUBJECT OF THE BANK RE|SUMED.</HEAD>
<P>IT is re&s;umed to evince the integrity of the ob&s;erva|tion, intimating the exi&s;tence of numerous frauds in this contrivance, not yet adduced.</P>
<P>National wealth, and national rights, tottering on the brink of perdition, irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;olicited our fir&s;t at|tention; and all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te was made to exhibit their danger, without di&s;tracting the public attention, by compelling it to view the Proteus in too great a variety of &s;hapes.</P>
<P>This important duty being di&s;charged, it may not be ami&s;s to continue our enquiries concerning the public or private morality of this in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The bank may buy and &s;ell lands including their ca|pital to the amount of 15,000,000 of dollars. But if they exceed their capital, who is to know it? They are not to di&s;clo&s;e the extent of their landed e&s;tate, even to the mini&s;ter; and no power, can require &s;uch a di&s;|clo&s;ure of them. If an exce&s;s is di&s;covered, and could be proved, which is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, no penalty is &s;ub|joined or forfeiture incurred; and the effect of &s;uch a di&s;covery would have been ea&s;ily fru&s;trated, had a for|feiture followed it, by a fraudulent exerci&s;e of the pow|er
<PB N="66" REF="027782_0069_0FD64010C13F7D10">
to &s;ell. In this view the bank law is a &s;tatute of mortmain, and the lands of the community may be gra|dually &s;wallowed up by a corporation, which does not propo&s;e in exchange for them, either political or eter|nal &s;alvation. Perpetuities of landed e&s;tates, devolving by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, are e&s;tabli&s;hed, to the di&s;couragement of commerce and indu&s;try; to the impoveri&s;hment of the laity; and to the aggrandi&s;ement of the bank mili|litant mini&s;try. It is an incorporated feudal tenure, and the community is &s;ubjected to homage and fealty, for their circulating medium, as well as their lands.</P>
<P>The bank dividends are not to be coexten&s;ive with the real profits, but are to be regulated by the directors. Hence the extent of the impo&s;ition is concealed from the public. The community lo&s;e the chance of having all they pay thrown back into circulation, by the extra|vagance or luxury of individuals. An <HI>accumulating</HI> fund, which may make the corporation richer than the nation, and of cour&s;e more powerful, is a branch of the &s;cheme. It may con&s;tantly retain, what the nation a|lone &s;upplies. Thus the amu&s;ements of mathematici|ans, in calculating the effects of compound intere&s;t, are to be realized at the national expence; and a fund is &s;ecured for extending the mortmain bu&s;ine&s;s, or with which to buy a new charter at the end of twenty years by public or private negociations, if the bank &s;hould not then have members enough in Congre&s;s to give it to it|&s;elf. The body corporate can either extend or dimini&s;h its profits. This is a kind of la&s;h capable of being ap|plied to their refractory bodies natural, either in or out of Congre&s;s, to whip them in, to the incorporated mea|&s;ures. The &s;upremacy of the body politic over its mem|bers is by this means effectually e&s;tabli&s;hed, and a uni|ted impetus &s;ecured to it. In this part of the &s;cheme is al&s;o to be di&s;cerned an unnece&s;&s;ary precaution, as expe|rience has evinced, in ca&s;e things &s;hould go badly. In this event, the corporation by its directors, had nothing to do, but to declare an exorbitant dividend, and then

to &s;ell out individually to the unwary, the bank &s;tock, thus enhanced in price.</P>
<P>The debts are not to exceed 10,000,000 of dollars, <HI>over and above the money depo&s;ited in the bank for &s;afe-keeping,</HI> and over and above 5,000,000 <HI>worth</HI> of lands. Diffi|cult as it is to a&s;certain what may be the &s;tock, property and debts of the bank by law, yet no penalty exi&s;ts for enforcing obedience to the law, except that if the bank incurs debts beyond 10,000,000, they &s;hall actually pay them. The profit of the bank ari&s;es out of paper, money, or debts, bearing no intere&s;t. Where is the pe|nalty of paying &pound;100, and receiving &pound;106 for &s;o doing? The traffic of the bank is under no limitation, but the national ability to bear it. The partial power of in|&s;pection, conferred upon a member of the coalition, by way of national &s;ecurity, might have been exemplified by a common proverb, except for the indelicacy of the terms.</P>
<P>Why does the law hold out an idea of limiting the acqui&s;itions of the bank? If they are hone&s;t, to limit them was unju&s;t; if di&s;hone&s;t, it &s;hould acquire nothing. If the gain came from abroad, it was re&s;training a na|tional good; but if the re&s;traint admits that it was to come out of the nation, it is a tax when not a penny was due, and not a penny of public money could Congre&s;s be&s;tow, in liberality to the rich. If the gain was not like to be &s;o enormous, as to endanger the <HI>common-wealth,</HI> it required no limitation, If it was, why erect a mi&s;chief in order to re&s;train it&mdash;why extend it &s;o enormou&s;ly&mdash;or why re&s;train it with fetters of &s;and? This pretence of a limitation tells a tale. It confe&s;&s;es that the gain is enor|mous&mdash;that it is paid at the public expence&mdash;and that the contrivance contains &s;ome lurking mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>But the law provides that the bank may lend to go|vernment to any amount. Its acqui&s;itions in this mode are rendered indefinite, if any definition could before have been di&s;cerned. And here the contrivance, ex|panding
<PB N="68" REF="027782_0071_0FD64013BB8872B0">
its views, exhibits an unlimited &s;cope of de&s;igns, and contemplates a direct operation on government it|&s;elf. Bank people in Congre&s;s, may in this ca&s;e, vote that government &s;hould make unnece&s;&s;ary loans of them|&s;elves, for the purpo&s;es of extending their capital&mdash;en|crea&s;ing their profits&mdash;and acquiring an influence. The eagerne&s;s to put this part of the &s;y&s;tem into a train, hath already explained its objects. Two millions four hundred thou&s;and dollars have been already borrowed by government of the bank upon intere&s;t, and a further loan of 800,000 dollars was &s;anctioned at the la&s;t Con|gre&s;s, although above 1,300,000 dollars of public mo|ney was at that time lying dead in &s;undry banks. By a &s;imilar trick, the bank of England has indi&s;&s;olubly con|nected it&s;elf with that government, and a <HI>perpetual re|newal</HI> of its charter is in&s;ured. Although its dividends have never been lower than five and an half <HI>per centum,</HI> it hath al&s;o gotten more than <HI>cent. per cent.</HI> on its capital in a government debt. Great as this property is, it is far out&s;tripped by the American bank, as will pre&s;ently be &s;hown. In that country, an enormous profit, and an undue legi&s;lative influence, have flowed from the contri|vance. In this, the u&s;e of &s;imilar means, clearly indicates an intention to attain &s;imilar ends. With this difference, that our in&s;titution exceeds enormity it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The twenty five bank directors may be paid by the corporation much or little as they choo&s;e; and whether paid or not, the whole of them may be taken out of the Senate, which con&s;i&s;ts of thirty members. Even the pre&s;ident of the United States may be cho&s;en, and act as a bank director. In what part of the con&s;titution is the flaw to be found, permiting infractions of its own principles, &s;o egregious? If bank directors &s;erve the bank without wages, whil&s;t they demand wages of the nation, their affection for or intere&s;t in the one, mu&s;t be greater that their affection for, or intere&s;t in, the other. And if wages are their object, they will be pro|portioned to their earnings. Something beyond, "Well

done tho&s;e good and faithful &s;ervants," will be expected for doubling the talents.</P>
<P>The intimation that the profits of the bank are ex|travagant, de&s;erves an expo&s;ition by items. Premi&s;ing, that a per&s;on out of the &s;ecret, is confined to &s;uch items only, as are of public notoriety, &s;o that tho&s;e of a pri|vate nature, will remain uncalculated.</P>
<P>Three fourths of the bank depo&s;it, are to con&s;i&s;t of certificates, and one fourth of &s;pecie. Suppo&s;e &pound;100 thus depo&s;ited. The dividend at the end of the year was was eight <HI>per centum.</HI> The &pound;75 of certificates were gaining an intere&s;t of &s;ix <HI>per cent per annum,</HI> &s;o that the whole profit is made out of the &pound;25 &s;pecie, which is all the per&s;on making the depo&s;it lo&s;es the u&s;e of. Up|on this &s;um the profit in one year is above <HI>thirty per centum.</HI> But the bank began to operate when only one fourth of the &s;tock &s;ub&s;cribed was depo&s;ited, four in|&s;talments of &s;ix months each being allowed, and yet the dividends have been made upon the total &s;tock &s;ub&s;cri|bed. Hence only &pound;12 10 0. actual ca&s;h for each &pound;100 &s;tock, was depo&s;ited during the whole of the fir&s;t year, and this received and u&s;ance of &pound;8, as regu|lated by the directors, exclu&s;ive of the gain in lands, debts, &s;peculations, and loans for the incorporated be|nefit. Are not the talents doubled? and may not the bank exclaim, "Well done thou good and faithful &s;er|vants?"</P>
<P>Though the <HI>&s;ix per centum</HI> upon certificates, con&s;ti|tuted a portion of the total gain, made by the corpora|tion, yet there was gain enough to con&s;titute the divi|dends, exclu&s;ive of this <HI>&s;ix per centum.</HI></P>
<P>It would hardly be a&s;&s;erted, that the profit of a bank, favoured of government, would be only <HI>two per centum,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;tock to have con&s;i&s;ted of &s;pecie, &s;o as not to get an intere&s;t, both by circulating paper on its cre|dit, and al&s;o as a debt due by government.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="027782_0073_0FD6401C16955388">
But the fact &s;hould not re&s;t upon a &s;uppo&s;ition which can be denied.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of the dividends, and all other gains, the bank had already lent to government on the fir&s;t of Ja|nuary 1793, 2,400,000 dollars, for which it was then receiving intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Therefore the profits, &s;upplying not only this loan, but al&s;o the dividends, it follows obviou&s;ly, that the intere&s;t upon the certificates was more than doubled at the national expence; and con&s;equently that the 7,500,000 dollars of public debt depo&s;ited, was in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly conjured up by what is called financiering &s;kill and federation, to between fifteen and thirty millions.</P>
<P>The preci&s;e amount cannot be a&s;certained, becau&s;e both the item of lands acquired, and that important ar|ticle of private debts due to the bank, are left out of the calculation; both being of a &s;ecret nature.</P>
<P>As the republic did not depo&s;it her two millions of &s;tock, all the &s;pecie of the whole bank &s;ub&s;cription, &s;uppo&s;ing every &s;hilling paid, amounted to 2,000,000 of dollars; and out of it the directors have not only made a dividend of <HI>eight per centum</HI> on 10,000,000 which is a gain of 800,000 dollars <HI>per annum,</HI> but have al&s;o lent the government 2,400,000 dollars. The ta|lents are trebled in two years. It is not &s;aid, that the bank had &s;old its certificates previous to January 1793.</P>
<P>The capital of the bank of England was &pound;10,000,000 &s;terling. It has only been able to lend to that govern|ment from its in&s;titution, about &pound;.12,000,000, and its dividends have long been as low as <HI>five and an half per centum.</HI> The &s;pecie capital of the United States bank was only 2,000,000 of dollars, and in le&s;s than two years, it lent 2,400,000 to government, and divided <HI>eight per</HI>

<HI>centum</HI> on 10,000,000. How far, arithmeticians, does the copy out&s;trip the original?</P>
<P>Did or did not the bank lend to the public 2,000,000 in actual &s;pecie, to depo&s;it for the public &s;tock. If it did, ignorant as we are of the other items of profit, its enormity is &s;ufficiently evinced. If it did not, the re|public was defrauded in a variety of ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. Had actual ca&s;h been borrowed el&s;ewhere and de|po&s;ited, the bank might have extended its bu&s;ine&s;s, to the increa&s;e of the profits, of which the public would have received a fifth part; whereas 60,000 dollars are now annually paid for no advantage, four-fifths of which are divided among the private &s;ub&s;cribers.</P>
<P N="2">2. The credit of the bank re&s;ts upon the credit of the republic, as to 7,500,000 dollars of certificate &s;tock, and whil&s;t individuals are depo&s;iting the credit of the republic for three-fourths of their &s;ub&s;criptions, the republic is prohibited from depo&s;iting her own cre|dit, for any proportion of hers.</P>
<P N="3">3. Further, although the credit of the bank re&s;ts up|on the credit of the government, yet the government is made to borrow 2,000,000 of bank credit, which it&s;elf erected, &s;u&s;tains and can annihilate, and for the&s;e nothings, to pay annually 60,000 &s;omethings. When this is done upon an a&s;&s;ertion, "that the credit of the bank is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the credit of the nation," preci&s;ely the rever&s;e of the truth, may it not be pronounced, that there is verity in the charge, "that the public good is &s;acrificed to this in&s;titution."</P>
<P N="4">4. But that which carries the impo&s;ition to the mo&s;t extravagant degree, is, that the public (if the bank did not lend actual ca&s;h) pays intere&s;t for the <HI>credit</HI> of the bank, whil&s;t the bank pays none, for the <HI>money</HI> of the public. The &s;ecretary reported, that on the 1&s;t of
<PB N="72" REF="027782_0075_0FD6401D72B9A438">
January 1793, 1,229,517 dollars 20 cents, of public money, in the bank of the United States, exclu&s;ive of 614,593 dollars 2 cents, which he reported to be due for bills drawn for foreign loans, negociated by that bank; and exclu&s;ive of 158,778 dollars 25 cents, de|po&s;ited in other banks. And on that day the public was paying intere&s;t to the bank of the United States for 2,400,000 dollars.</P>
<P>If the bank advanced this large &s;um to the public in actual ca&s;h, whil&s;t it was hourly lending to individuals al&s;o, it mu&s;t either have been drained of its ca&s;h, or its profits mu&s;t have exceeded imagination; it is therefore probable, that it was di&s;counting from the u&s;e of the 1,229,517 dollars 20 cents of public money, whil&s;t it was receiving intere&s;t of the public. If it lent only 2,000,000 of credit, and laid out the 2,000,000 of ca&s;h which it ought to have lent in certificates, and depo&s;i|ted the certificates as a fund upon which to circulate paper, what would be the annual gain upon the &s;ame 2,000,000? An&s;wer. 60,000 dollars intere&s;t for the credit lent, 60,000 for the certificates bought, and 120,000 for 4,000,000 of paper circulated on the de|po&s;it. Excluding the idea of certificates, <HI>eighteen per centum per annum</HI> is paid. The re&s;ources of <HI>no body</HI> mu&s;t be very great. I acknowledge that one fifth of the&s;e gains con&s;titute an article of tho&s;e re&s;ources.</P>
<P>Let the fact be either way, the enormity of the im|po&s;ition is evinced by le&s;s than a moiety of the items. Suppo&s;e we had the re&s;t? It is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that the public, thought one fifth owners of the machine, are allowed no directors. For what would come of it, if the whole &s;ecret was known?</P>
<P>And this is a contrivance for erecting <HI>"an active ca|pital."</HI> It is indeed an appo&s;ite expre&s;&s;ion. In <HI>activity</HI> it is a perpetual motion, collecting wealth for an ari&s;to|cracy, and impoveri&s;hing all other cla&s;&s;es of the com|munity. How does the filching annually an enormous

&s;um from their capitals, to con&s;titute annual dividends for a few rich individuals, and to erect an incorporated mon&s;ter, &s;ecretly and con&s;tantly ingulphing real proper|ty, and national re&s;ources, in the aby&s;s of perpetuity, favour agriculture, commerce or manufactures?</P>
<P>It would be better for the community, if &s;uch con|tributions were thrown into the &s;ea. Though the pro|perty would be lo&s;t, liberty would be pre&s;erved. Now its wealth fo&s;ters its natural enemy, whil&s;t the general welfare is impoveri&s;hed, and the common &s;trength, di&s;|abled. The &s;inew of defence is transfering to tho&s;e, from whom we have mo&s;t cau&s;e to fear offence. And the du&s;t of a few new terms, inter&s;per&s;ed with the jargon of a &s;y&s;tem, who&s;e principle is perplexity, and who&s;e de&s;ign is treachery, is expected to hide from the public view, the ambu&s;cade which lurks behind.</P>
<P>The bank having the monopoly of the bulk of the circulating medium, may occa&s;ionally increa&s;e or dimi|ni&s;h the quantity. It may dimini&s;h the quantity, thus enhance its value, and purcha&s;e with its own paper, cer|tificates or other property, which are depreciated, in the &s;ame proportion, as the medium is appretiated. It may then increa&s;e the quantity of this circulating me|dium, le&s;&s;en its value, appretiate certificates or other property of cour&s;e, and then &s;ell a <HI>portion</HI> of the &s;ame certificates or other property, to take in the paper which the <HI>whole</HI> co&s;t. If the law prohibiting this incorpora|ted traffic in <HI>certificates,</HI> could even di&s;cover the fact, yet the traffic would &s;till have open to it, the endle&s;s li&s;t of whatever is valuable. And the individual mem|bers are not even nominally re&s;trained.</P>
<P>This is a compleat commercial de&s;poti&s;m. Every mer|chant is &s;ecured beyond the reach of government, and yet the bank can ruin almo&s;t any merchant, without even a power in government to &s;ave him. A re&s;pecta|ble cla&s;s of citizens, are thus cajoled by a few of its mem|bers,

who enjoy &s;ome exclu&s;ive fruits from the contri|vance, into an approbation of the mo&s;t unre&s;trained &s;pe|cies of indirect and &s;ecret power over their property; whil&s;t the &s;ame men would &s;purn at the &s;ame thing, if exhibited in a &s;imple incorporated &s;ociety, for enriching or impoveri&s;hing, <HI>whom&s;oever it might plea&s;e the direc|tors.</HI> Hone&s;ty, indu&s;try, and punctuality, are no lon|ger a &s;ecurity for &s;ucce&s;s. Profit is to be made by &s;u|perior cunning and intrigue in finding out bank &s;ecrets. The profits of trade will no longer be an honourable compen&s;ation, for &s;upplying the mutual wants of di&s;tant nations. They will con&s;i&s;t chiefly of mean pilferings from our next neighbours. The reputable and u&s;eful &s;ociety of merchants, will dwindle into a di&s;hone&s;t a&s;&s;o|ciation of &s;peculators, for <HI>tricking</HI> each other, as well as the whole community, of their money, by a trade in ideas.</P>
<P>The circulating medium is the &s;oul and food of com|merce. A corporation, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a power over the &s;oul, can animate, or annihilate the body at plea&s;ure. By with-holding its food, they may &s;tarve commerce; by glutting it, they may produce a mercantile pletho|ra. A foreknowledge of the&s;e effects, is an unlimited power of taxation. In a civilized &s;ociety, the circula|ting medium, is al&s;o the &s;oul of agriculture, arts and manufactures. All the faculties of the nation are &s;ub|ject to the regimen of an incorporated quackery, in|&s;tead of pur&s;uing a natural impul&s;e, in &s;earch of their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. If the phy&s;ician was hone&s;t, yet an artificial regimen in a &s;tate of health, produces debility, and ha&s;tens di&s;&s;olution; but when his fees depend on the irregularity of his pre&s;criptions, and when he is a mere Hiccius Doccius of a fellow, he will &s;oon de&s;troy the &s;ounde&s;t con&s;titution.</P>
<P>A monopoly of the circulating medium, is an uni|ver&s;al power of embargo, over trade, agriculture, and manufactures, depo&s;ited in the hands of a few private

<P>Suppo&s;e a monopoly of gold was be&s;towed on one corporation&mdash;of &s;ilver on another&mdash;of the Engli&s;h and French trades on others; proceeding to parcel out all the branches of trade, agriculture, arts, and almo&s;t &s;ciences, among &s;o many &s;imilar mini&s;terial contri|vances. It might enrich the members of the &s;everal corporations, but the public would exclaim, trade is ruined&mdash;the national happine&s;s is de&s;troyed. And yet &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem would be more ju&s;t than the bank contri|vance, in being more general&mdash;in producing &s;ome little competition&mdash;and in being le&s;s an engine of political de&s;igns and legi&s;lative corruption. The monopoly of the circulating medium involves a monopoly of all the&s;e objects. The bank has a flu&s;h of trumps, with palm, the knave, at their head, which loos the re&s;t of the community; and if it does not &s;eize the whole &s;take at one gra&s;p, it is on account of the obvious impolicy of de&s;troying the hen which lays the golden eggs.</P>
<P>The little &s;pecie left by the &s;y&s;tem in circulation, is only a kind of &s;mall change, or a &s;ort of permi&s;&s;ive bank alms, as it pays them no tax, and is too incon&s;i|derable in its amount, to impugn a &s;ingle important ef|fect, flowing from the monopoly of the circulating me|dium.</P>
<P>The calamities of the la&s;t war, re&s;ulting from the bani&s;hment of &s;pecie by a paper medium, were proba|bly equivalent to tho&s;e produced by the &s;word. The banking contrivances are rapidly reducing us again, to the &s;ame ruinous and mi&s;erable &s;ituation.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIV.&mdash;THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>THE tax paid to the bank as inevitably falls upon labour ultimately, as the impo&s;t does; nor has labour in either ca&s;e the &s;malle&s;t chance of exerting any degree of volition; it can only exert its indu&s;try, to pay a debt impo&s;ed upon it by law, which it mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily di&s;charge.</P>
<P>The whole gro&s;s value of the exports from the Uni|ted States, for twelve months previous to October 179<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, was 17,371,551 dollars. This was the product of labour, exclu&s;ive of its food. And out of this a|mount mu&s;t be deducted the freight, commi&s;&s;ions, clothing, tools, liquors, and other nece&s;&s;aries, which it mu&s;t pay for. Conjecture that an annual profit is made by labour beyond its annual needs, even of 8,000,000. One days profit requires four day's work. Taking the&s;e data, and narrowing the profit of the bank down to its &s;imple annual dividend, labour mu&s;t toil at lea&s;t forty-nine days in each year to rai&s;e the di|vidend of the bank of the United States, amounting to 800,000 dollars. And if the profits of all the banks amount to 2,000,000 annually, labour mu&s;t toil ninety-one days every year to pay them. Recollect that the pre&s;ent annual expenditure of the nation, intere&s;t, and the expences of government included, exceeds 5,000,000 of dollars, and then con&s;ider the pre&s;ent &s;tate of labour. Suppo&s;e a law was propo&s;ed, a nece&s;&s;ary effect of which would be, that a few rich men &s;hould work ninety-one days in the year for the re&s;t of the commu|nity. Both the oppre&s;&s;ion and the gain would <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> finitely contracted. But the principle would remain unchanged, though the ca&s;e would be altered greatly for the better. If the profit made by labour extended even to 10,000,000 annually, the bank of the United States would be receiving <HI>eight per centum</HI> annually, in its dividends only, out of this profit. And if the capi|tals
<PB N="77" REF="027782_0080_0FD64028AD8A6AB0">
of this, and the other banks, extend to 17,371,551 dollars, and their dividends amount to <HI>eight per centum</HI> upon an average, then labour pays that enormous inte|re&s;t to banks, upon the <HI>gro&s;s</HI> amount of her exports. But if we add to the dividends, every other item of profit, and allow the community a maintenance, it is within bounds to conjecture, that <HI>forty per centum</HI> up|on her nett profit, is annually paid by the community to the &s;everal banks.</P>
<P>And what compen&s;ation do the banks make to the community for tho&s;e enormous gains and exclu&s;ive privi|leges? Have they made a bu&s;hel of wheat or a horn tooth comb? Actual &s;pecie is but a repre&s;entative of real wealth. But it is equivalent thereto, becau&s;e it can transfer real wealth to us from a foreign nation; where|as bank paper can neither increa&s;e our exports, or pay for our imports, &s;ince its currency is local. The bank is therefore an incorporation of &s;inecures, quartered upon labour, and may be ju&s;tly &s;tiled, the Iri&s;h e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of America.</P>
<P>Debt is &s;ervice or labour, and &s;ervice or labour is &s;lavery. And &s;o is &s;lavery defined in the fourth &s;ec|tion of the con&s;titution. For money being the repre|&s;entative of labour, and the only medium by which debt can be paid, the creditor is in fact the ma&s;ter of the debtor, for the quantum of &s;ervice or labour, nece&s;|&s;ary to di&s;charge that debt. If &s;o, the United States are by the bank contrivances, placed preci&s;ely in the &s;ituation of a &s;lave, who has purcha&s;ed of his ma&s;ter about four day's freedom in each week; becau&s;e for more than one day in each week, they owe &s;ervice to the bank of the United States, and for about two days, to the &s;everal banks now operating. How improperly then do we &s;peak? In&s;tead of &s;aying, "the bank of the United States," it would be more proper to &s;ay, "the United States of the bank."</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="027782_0081_0FD6402CDBB9EA68">
And the law enacts that we &s;hall be the United States of the bank for twenty years. During &s;o long a lea&s;e without impeachment of wa&s;te, the tenant will either ruin the e&s;tate, or provide for the purcha&s;e in fee. If the <HI>product</HI> of the e&s;tate, and not its <HI>improvement,</HI> had not been the object, wherefore were other tenants ex|cluded? This wi&s;e exclu&s;ion of partners in &s;poiling the nation, evinces the truth of the line of argument I have adopted by di&s;clo&s;ing the de&s;ign of the contrivance.</P>
<P>The law of primogeniture and fir&s;t fruits is revived. The bank is the fir&s;t born of legi&s;lation, with an intail for 20 years, and more than a chance for the rever&s;ion in fee. Or it is rather an heir apparent, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the regency, on account of the parent's idiocy.</P>
<P>A <HI>pretence</HI> of rendering &s;ome compen&s;ation to the community, for its pre-eminent powers, and exorbitant acqui&s;itions, was nece&s;&s;ary to lull enquiry into a coma|to&s;e &s;tate. And therefore it is alleged that the in&s;titu|tion enables merchants to extend commerce, to give better prices for commodities, and to encourage indu|&s;try. And England is re&s;orted to, as an example pro|ving the&s;e allegations.</P>
<P>Merchants are brokers, honourable and u&s;eful, whil&s;t adhering to a &s;teady line of commerce, and &s;upplying the wants of a nation, but pernicious and dangerous, whil&s;t &s;peculating indi&s;criminately on foes and friends for the acqui&s;ition of wealth, and a&s;piring to exclu&s;ive pre|vileges and prerogatives.</P>
<P>They are of a cla&s;s unproductive, and therefore if ca|pitals are to be rai&s;ed at the public expence, it would be more beneficial to commerce, to be&s;tow them on agri|culture or manufactures, which alone create the real fund for an exten&s;ion of commerce, for the purpo&s;e of enabling them to make la&s;ting and productive improve|ments. Taking from the productive cla&s;s therefore, to
<PB N="79" REF="027782_0082_0FD64031168073C8">
be&s;tow upon the unproductive is inverting the cour&s;e of nature, when an exten&s;ion of commerce is the object.</P>
<P>A reaction of the&s;e capitals as an incitement to indu|&s;try, cannot be a <HI>permanent</HI> effect from a bank. The quantity of paper which can be circulated, is limited by the national ability to pay for it, and the employment it can find. Specie is liable to the latter limit only, and therefore more &s;pecie than paper, can find employment in a nation, becau&s;e for &s;pecie there is nothing to pay. If a member of the commercial world, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;pecie &s;ufficient for its occa&s;ions, and banks are e&s;tabli&s;hed which emit paper equal in amount to this &s;pecie, the latter mu&s;t depart for want of employment. If more pa|per is emited, a momentary and unnatural &s;pur may be given to indu&s;try, at the commencement of the operati|on; but it would be fleeting and tran&s;itory, for the in|&s;tant the true level of circulating medium has regulated it&s;elf, things at be&s;t, would &s;ub&s;ide to their u&s;ual cour&s;e. But they will &s;ink lower, becau&s;e the community having exchanged &s;pecie for paper, hath lo&s;t a long &s;tring of advantages po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the former over the latter; and becau&s;e wor&s;ted as it is in numberle&s;s ways by the ex|change, labour will moreover be burthened with an in|tere&s;t of <HI>&s;ix per centum</HI> on the amount of the circulating paper, whereas the national labour paid nothing for &s;pe|cie. How compleatly is &s;uch a community jockeyed?</P>
<P>Again. <HI>La&s;ting improvements</HI> can never be produced by bank contrivances, on account of the rapidity with which bank paper, whil&s;t it is alive, is pa&s;&s;ed from hand to hand. La&s;ting and productive improvements in ma|nufactures and agriculture, require the u&s;e of a capital for &s;everal years, becau&s;e profit from labour flows in &s;lowly. And &s;uch capitals our banks never furni&s;h. The contrivance is only adapted for &s;udden &s;peculati|ons; to favour a quick and rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of good bargains; and to enable the bank to gain compound in|tere&s;t, by renewing its paper three or four times a year.
<PB N="80" REF="027782_0083_0FD640326DE88488">
The medium for &s;uch a traffic being local al&s;o, the gain re&s;ulting from it mu&s;t not only be filched from citi|zens, but in&s;tead of producing, it mu&s;t ob&s;truct la&s;ting improvements, and di&s;courage, by impoveri&s;hing, in|du&s;try.

And would not the effects be &s;o &s;orely felt by the &s;i&s;ter &s;tates, as &s;oon to de&s;troy the banking &s;y&s;tems throughout the union? The United States, as a mem|ber of the commercial world, will &s;peedily occupy a &s;i|milar pre-eminent &s;tation, over &s;i&s;ter nations, by abo|li&s;hing banks. For &s;pecie will ever flow, where it can find employment.</P>
<P>In lieu of this &s;y&s;tem is &s;ub&s;tituted a corporation of rich men, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a power of expelling the only uni|ver&s;al medium of commerce, of &s;ub&s;tituting a local me|dium in its &s;tead, having a monopoly of this local medi|um, and thus compleatly enabled to regulate the price of every &s;pecies of produce. The lower this produce can be bought, the higher are their gains; becau&s;e tho&s;e who buy bank paper at a premium, cannot pay the premium, and mu&s;t cea&s;e to deal at the paper &s;hop, un|le&s;s they can &s;ell it at a higher price than they gave. The bank &s;ells the commodity by whole&s;ale, and are paid a whole&s;ale profit. The dealers will then retail it, getting an advance upon the whole fir&s;t co&s;t, and &s;ince the commodity will not do for tran&s;portation, the nation as the only con&s;umers, pay this double profit. Will the bank exert the power of regulating the price of labour, for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing it; and is a mono|poly a good &s;ub&s;titute for a competition? Reflect. Can
<PB N="81" REF="027782_0084_0FD64034BA76EF28">
the bank cau&s;e the price of produce or of paper, to fluctuate? What mu&s;t be the effect of this power? and compare the price of wheat in 1789, when there was a partial and local &s;carcity in France, with the price of the &s;ame article in 1792, when a general European &s;car|city and warfare united to enhance it. Not forgetting that many of the&s;e contrivances, have been erected in the interim.</P>
<P>The truth is, that the price of our exports abroad, and not the banking operations at home, can only en|hance their value. Out of that price mu&s;t be deducted, freight, profit and commi&s;&s;ion; and to the&s;e deductions are &s;uperadded the dividends and other profits of banks. Will deductions rai&s;e the price?</P>
<P>Mercantile or &s;peculating people can only borrow of the bank, becau&s;e of its &s;hort credit; and to lend to o|thers, &s;o as to aid la&s;ting improvements or encourage indu&s;try, is never a purpo&s;e of tho&s;e who deal in bank paper. In no &s;tate does the legal intere&s;t for money exceed <HI>&s;ix per centum,</HI> and this intere&s;t mu&s;t be paid to the bank; therefore no per&s;on will borrow of the bank to lend again, when he can gain nothing. In all &s;tates, where the legal intere&s;t is &s;till lower, a lo&s;s would obvi|ou&s;ly en&s;ue. As would al&s;o be the ca&s;e, wherever that is the legal rate; becau&s;e the bank, by calling in loans &s;everal times a year, manages to gain more than <HI>&s;ix per centum per annum,</HI> which being a &s;hift to evade, would not in a private ca&s;e be tolerated by, a &s;tatute of u&s;ury. Therefore bank paper is a proper medium for <HI>&s;udden &s;trokes</HI> at good bargains <HI>only.</HI> The&s;e &s;trokes fall upon citizens <HI>only,</HI> and con&s;titute a mode for the encourage|ment of indu&s;try, novel and incomprehen&s;ible to tho&s;e who receive, but clear and con&s;picuous to tho&s;e who inflict the &s;troke.</P>
<P>Labour is burthened with a compound intere&s;t on this bank medium, under the pretences of encouraging indu&s;try, and furni&s;hing a capital for improvement,
<PB N="82" REF="027782_0085_0FD64034C3D46C48">
which are obviou&s;ly deceitful and fallacious. If labour had received the loans of the bank, and had thus e&s;ca|ped the gain which it pays to tho&s;e who do, yet it mu&s;t have paid the bank profits. The dividends are <HI>eight per centum,</HI> exclu&s;ive of other great acqui&s;itions before &s;ta|ted. Can agriculture or manufactures afford to pay &s;uch an intere&s;t for a capital? The returns made by la&s;ting improvements, bear no &s;imiltude to tho&s;e of &s;pe|culating rogueries. Who will lend for the purpo&s;e of encouraging indu&s;try, or to aid la&s;ting improvements, at <HI>five per centum,</HI> when by inve&s;ting his money in bank &s;tock, he will certainly gain above <HI>eight per centum;</HI> Private loans are thus annihilated, and no &s;ub&s;titute for the attainment of &s;uch objects propo&s;ed. A rate of bank profit, exceeding the rate of legal intere&s;t, mu&s;t draw the national money to this vortex of impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Banks are money brokers, receiving exorbitant com|mi&s;&s;ions. A kind of trea&s;urers of the whole circula|ting medium, receiving <HI>annually</HI> of the nation, among whom it circulates, above <HI>&s;ix per centum</HI> on its amount. In le&s;s than &s;eventeen years, they gain the intire total. Enough to &s;upport at lea&s;t a &s;even years war, with 20,000 men con&s;tantly in the field. What an alarm|ing idea? Suppo&s;e government and the bank &s;hould coale&s;ce, and form a treaty with &s;ome foreign poten|tate, to de&s;troy what they have already united to in|fringe? Are u&s;urpations more ea&s;ily corrected in a &s;tate of maturity, than at their commencement?</P>
<P>It is plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve the dilemma to which Con|gre&s;s are reduced by the contrivance. The con&s;titu|tion, in terms framed from a con&s;ideration of the mi&s;|chiefs heretofore produced by paper mediums, &s;trives mo&s;t carefully to interdict them in future. In <HI>dealing out power</HI> to Congre&s;s relative to a currency, it permits that body "to <HI>coin</HI> money;" and <HI>in re&s;training</HI> the power of the &s;tates, it prohibits them from "<HI>coining</HI> money, <HI>emitting bills of credit, or</HI> making any thing a
<PB N="83" REF="027782_0086_0FD64036314CBA40">
tender but gold and &s;ilver." In not giving the power of e&s;tabli&s;hing a paper currency to the one, and in ta|king it expre&s;ly from the other, the con&s;titution de&s;ign|ed to &s;ecure the &s;ociety again&s;t the frauds and vices of paper tricks. That circulating paper medium of eve|ry kind was intended to be inhibited, is obvious from the di&s;tinction, between &s;uch a medium, and making <HI>any thing</HI> a tender. Both are &s;eparately condemned; and the medium, though unaccompanied with the ten|der, is expre&s;sly forbidden. The tender is indeed an aggravation of that which is mi&s;chievous without the tender. The &s;tates being re&s;trained from e&s;tabli&s;hing a paper currency, could not empower a corporation to do it. They could not be&s;tow, what they did not po&s;|&s;e&s;s. But, alas! poor Congre&s;s! having broken the con&s;titution them&s;elves, they are obliged to wink upon its flagrant breach by mo&s;t of the &s;tates, which have, without any bad intention, followed their baneful ex|ample. With grief mu&s;t Congre&s;s &s;uffer their twenty years monopoly to be broken in upon, and &s;nacks of the national plunder to fall to the &s;hare of rival corpo|rations. It mu&s;t however be confe&s;&s;ed, that the conte&s;t is unequal, &s;ince the good things redounding from the public pur&s;e, are exclu&s;ively enjoyed by the pur&s;e bear|ers. Had the &s;tates gone into the &s;y&s;tem of their own head, and not as blind tran&s;cribers of the example &s;et by the higher powers, we &s;hould have heard clamourings, which could not now be uttered by a party of the cho|rus.</P>
<P>Ignorant as we are of the effects of banking in Eng|land, it is nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome notice of an example quoted in favour of the contrivance. Bold a&s;&s;ertions may be hazarded, when the proof is beyond our reach; and therefore the quotation. But if England may be likened unto a &s;eigniory po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of profitable e&s;tates, pouring into its lap their products in con&s;tant &s;treams of wealth&mdash;if the riches of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies roll into her trea&s;ury&mdash;if &s;he is the tax gatherer of Ireland
<PB N="84" REF="027782_0087_0FD640366B171CD8">
and Scotland&mdash;if &s;he &s;hares in the fi&s;heries&mdash;if &s;he is al|mo&s;t unrivalled in manufactures and unequalled in com|merce&mdash;if her labouring cla&s;s of citizens are indu&s;trious and her &s;oil exuberant, why is her pro&s;perity (if &s;he is pro&s;perous) attributed to her banking contrivances. Whil&s;t a glare of imaginary pro&s;perity is painted by terms, the offsprings of invention, to tempt the nation, a productive cau&s;e equally fal&s;e is credited for it, to mi&s;lead us. If effects, bearing a faint re&s;emblance, to the high colourings in which they are depicted, do ex|i&s;t, they are accounted for by an un&s;een &s;peculating in|fluence, without re&s;orting to a &s;ingle obvious cau&s;e.</P>
<P>On the contrary, &s;uppo&s;e we were to con&s;ider the poor rates, and the rate of luxury in England, as the ex|po&s;itors of banking &s;chemes. Redundant wealth and pinching want, would turn out to be the effects in par|celling out the nece&s;&s;aries of life; and tyranny and &s;lavery the divi&s;ion they make, of what they term, "civil rights." Nothing could have deprived the Eng|li&s;h (the nation not the court) of enjoying diffu&s;ively their exclu&s;ive advantages, but a &s;y&s;tem con&s;tantly pil|laging from labour, to aggrandize wealth. Unle&s;s, therefore, America is langui&s;hing for a pea&s;antry, wretchedly poor, and an ari&s;tocracy luxuriou&s;ly rich and arrogantly proud, this Engli&s;h precedent has been unfortunately adduced, and more unfortunately pur|&s;ued.</P>
<P>But to con&s;ider how the bank will affect liberty at its extremities, when it hath &s;truck at its heart, by corrupt|ing the legi&s;lature it&s;elf, is really &s;uperfluous. It is therefore time to di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Subjoining, that the public wealth is pillaged to the extent of the national ability, and that no food for &s;pe|culation remains, except the public territory.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e who have pledged this territory for the re|demption of the debt, by <HI>legi&s;lative faith,</HI> &s;hould now
<PB N="85" REF="027782_0088_0FD624E21ED97218">
pervert the arms and treaties of the nation, to the breaking of this faith, for the purpo&s;e of acquiring principalities out of the national territory for them|&s;elves&mdash;If tho&s;e who call them&s;elves federal, &s;hould league with Indians and foreigners, to remove the land marks of union, and to revoke a fundamental &s;tipula|tion for the &s;ecurity of independency it&s;elf, it would both explode their profe&s;&s;ions, and prove the ju&s;tne&s;s of my arguments.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XV.&mdash;THE PRESENT STATE OF PARTIES CONSIDERED.</HEAD>
<P>FROM a colli&s;ion of parties truth fla&s;hes forth, and the community is the great arbiter between them. Parties are coun&s;el on oppo&s;ite &s;ides, capable, by argu|ment and rea&s;oning, of enlightening, or by buffoonery, &s;ophi&s;ms and perplexity, of in&s;ulting the judge. A &s;ong in the place of an explanation, or farcical new&s;paper ebullitions, in&s;tead of definitions and illu&s;trations, mu&s;t awaken the idea of a merry Andrew, entertaining a mob by his tricks and grimace, whil&s;t his accomplices are picking their pockets.</P>
<P>A party however mu&s;t &s;ignify, a confederation of in|dividuals for the private and exclu&s;ive benefit of them|&s;elves, and not for the public good. If then the ob|ject of this confederation is in conflict with the public good, tho&s;e who oppo&s;e it, de&s;erve rather the appella|tion of "a band of patriots," than the epithet of "a party," they are not contending for the benefit of a part, but of the whole community.</P>
<P>It is of importance to the community to di&s;cern, what intere&s;t falls within this definition of a party, and what line of politics, as excluded by it, is intitled to their con|fidence.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="027782_0089_0FD6403AD308ECC0">
And fir&s;t let us find out the de&s;ign of tho&s;e who di&s;|approve of the mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration. Are they in &s;earch of loaves and fi&s;hes? If &s;o, let the community demand, what tho&s;e loaves are? The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them can be&s;t tell. <HI>Legal &s;alaries</HI> of office are too mo|derate to con&s;titute an object for avarice, or to be a fund for tho&s;e enormous acqui&s;itions, which have not e&s;caped the eye of America. Is the favour of admi|ni&s;tration lucrative, or in any mode beneficial? Tell us, in what way, and to what extent, ye who know, that we may di&s;cern the undue &s;elfi&s;h influence, operating upon tho&s;e who complain of its mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>If the government is already a government of loaves and fi&s;hes, then the nece&s;&s;ity of an immediate reforma|tion is admitted, becau&s;e time &s;anctifies abu&s;es; if not, the motives which actuate tho&s;e who are &s;triving to prevent its becoming &s;o, mu&s;t be pure and patriotic.</P>
<P>The bank, 'tis a&s;&s;erted, is uncon&s;titutional&mdash;that it is a burthen&s;ome and fraudulent tax&mdash;that it impove|ri&s;hes all cla&s;&s;es of the community, except a &s;elected few&mdash;that it &s;ubverts the principles of repre&s;entation&mdash;and that with other mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration, it pro|ceeds unerringly and infallibly to ari&s;tocracy and mo|narchy. Now what <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> intere&s;t can a party, &s;ou|thern or northern, compounded of States or indivi|duals, have in defeating &s;uch de&s;igns? There is no dif|ficulty in di&s;cerning an intere&s;t of <HI>immen&s;e magnitude,</HI> and of an <HI>exclu&s;ive nature,</HI> re&s;iding in a party, for &s;up|porting a contrivance, of &s;o gainful a nature.</P>
<P>Can a majority of the people of a &s;ingle &s;tate, Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts for in&s;tance, be intere&s;ted in the &s;upport of mea|&s;ures, for ama&s;&s;ing wealth in a few hands, and levelled at the fundamental principles of civil liberty?</P>
<P>The agricultural, profe&s;&s;ional, and mechanical inte|re&s;ts of the community, at whatever point of the com|pa&s;s
<PB N="87" REF="027782_0090_0FD6403C8AE598B8">
they re&s;ide, are &s;o obviou&s;ly in the &s;ame predica|ment, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;clo&s;e the arts, by which they have been di&s;united.</P>
<P N="1">1. Public abu&s;es combine for mutual &s;upport, and the greate&s;t will be &s;elected as the patron of the re&s;t. Hence not only &s;tock-holders them&s;elves, but public officers who wi&s;h for higher &s;alaries&mdash;paper men and &s;peculators, who will gain by an increa&s;e of the public debt, and by the di&s;&s;ipation of the finances&mdash;and all who langui&s;h after ari&s;tocracy and monarchy, have en|li&s;ted under the au&s;pices of a chief. And hence the in|du&s;trious and vociferous cry, in favour of the mea&s;ures of the admini&s;tration. A li&s;t of &s;tock and certificate holders would explain it, to be the voice of private in|tere&s;t, and not of impartial approbation.</P>
<P N="2">2. A party will receive with open arms recruits of e|very character. Among others the old tories are mo&s;t cordially enli&s;ted. They naturally fall to tho&s;e, who are gaining by intrigue, what they fought for in vain. They are gratifying their pa&s;&s;ions without any expence to their principles. A victory, after a defeat, is the more plea&s;ing, as being a retalliation.</P>
<P N="3">3. In this mo&s;t wor&s;hipful &s;ociety, an endeavour is made to a&s;&s;ociate the Pre&s;ident. The a&s;&s;ociates a&s;&s;ume the character of being the &s;upporters, of that which they are undermining, becau&s;e they know his attatch|ment to the con&s;titution and good government. By geting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fortre&s;s, whil&s;t the commandant is un&s;u&s;picious of the fraud, it will be more ea&s;y to be|tray it to an enemy, or &s;ieze it for them&s;elves. They &s;tile them&s;elves "federali&s;ts," though it is obvious that they di&s;regard the con&s;titution, in its principles, as well as letter. The artifice is &s;tale; the Neros and Caligulas of Rome, were perpetually vociferating the terms "re|public and republican," long after the government was de&s;potic.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="88" REF="027782_0091_0FD6403DE3469FD8">
4. Hone&s;t men, when deceived, are the be&s;t &s;uppor|ters of knavery; hence the party, by a demarcation of fallacious intere&s;ts, is &s;triving to convert that cordial union, which was founded in times of di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;ce|mented by mutual &s;ufferings, and &s;ealed by compact, in|to the mo&s;t inveterate enmity. And a concord of hearts, habits&mdash;and of intere&s;t, which really exi&s;ts between the great bulk of the citizens of every &s;tate, is the devoted victim of machinations, de&s;igned to enrich and aggrandize a few. The ari&s;tocratical intere&s;t is a kind of flying &s;qua|dron, who&s;e object it is to divide the great ma&s;s of the people, by a geographical line, and to cajole one divi&s;ion, that it may live at free quarter on the labour of both.</P>
<P N="5">5. The party boa&s;t of the pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing condi|tion of our country, and a&s;cribe it to their own politics. Hone&s;ty though devoid of mode&s;ty, would have confe&s;|&s;ed, that peace, indu&s;try, and an increa&s;ed population, rather than paper contrivances, were the real grounds of national pro&s;perity. Cau&s;es, which in many Euro|pean countries, have &s;o far &s;urmounted political oppre&s;|&s;ions, as to exhibit a high degree of agricultural and mechanical improvement. But by adducing an argu|ment from a parallel between the pre&s;ent times, and times of war, it is confe&s;&s;ed, that a &s;ufficient degree of &s;imilitude exi&s;ts to bear a compari&s;on. It is admitted, that the community which is warring again&s;t monarchy and ari&s;tocracy, armed with paper only, does indeed occupy a &s;ituation, preferable to a nece&s;&s;ity of fighting again&s;t the &s;ame enemies, armed with the in&s;truments of death.</P>
<P N="6">6. The party call them&s;elves the government, and then demand of the public a confidence in the magi&s;tra|cy. Had they demanded a critical inve&s;tigation of their conduct, it would have been a better proof of integrity. But faith, and not truth, is their political motto. King craft, like religions e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, &s;ub&s;titutes my|&s;tery in the place of knowledge. It depends, not upon an enlightened conviction, but upon a blind idolatry.
<PB N="89" REF="027782_0092_0FD6403F9A671FF0">
Confidence or faith, is mo&s;t clamourou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on, when it is lea&s;t merited. <HI>Watchfulne&s;s,</HI> and not confidence, is inculcated by the con&s;titution. But if an uninformed faith is &s;till demanded, let us know with preci&s;&s;ion, how far it is to go&mdash;how many arguments it ought to re|fute&mdash;how many proofs it can &s;mother&mdash;and how much mi&s;chief it can ju&s;tify. And the blinde&s;t faith may per|haps di&s;cover, that it is already time to open its eyes and look about.</P>
<P N="7">7. An unnatural alliance between &s;tock and certifi|cate holders has been effected; unnatural &s;o far excep|ted, as certificates are depo&s;ited as bank &s;tock. By this means a real debt is interwoven with an artificial debt. A con&s;titutional demand is linked in brotherhood, with an uncon&s;titutional contrivance. A ju&s;t claim upon the public ability is rendered precarious, by burthening that ability with an unju&s;t and exorbitant tax. Real credi|tors are decoyed into a belief, that the be&s;t means of &s;ecuring them&s;elves, is to impo&s;e on their debtor a debt to a va&s;t amount, founded upon fiction, but yet &s;ecured by a mortgage in the nature of a rent charge for twen|ty years. Tho&s;e who have the &s;ecurity of the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, are &s;educed into mea&s;ures, &s;ubver&s;ive of con&s;titutional &s;anctions, and if they &s;ucceed, they de|&s;troy their own &s;ecurity. In &s;hort, a combination with a party, who&s;e exi&s;tence is precarious, hath been pre|ferred to an union with the whole community, who&s;e will is law.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is even pretended, that the community do not feel their taxes; and inferred, that not feeling they do not pay them. A &s;tate of political apathy is mo&s;t dan|gerous to liberty. If the community can only judge by their feelings, it is better to bring them to their &s;en&s;i|bility, through the medium of their under&s;tandings, than to leave them in &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction, until their natural, as well as their political arteries, are pier|ced by the goads of de&s;poti&s;m. And if they are in&s;en&s;i|ble of the impo&s;t, becau&s;e it operates only on con&s;u|mers
<PB N="90" REF="027782_0093_0FD6404100234F10">
of imported articles; yet they will certainly feel the bank tax, which is moreover an exci&s;e upon labour in every article it produces.</P>
<P N="9">9. A great merit is claimed by the ari&s;tocracy, on account of their being addicted to an, "energetic go|vernment." What latitude is concealed under this ge|neral expre&s;&s;ion, cannot be di&s;covered. Judging by the extent to which they have already pu&s;hed their de|&s;igns, we may fairly con&s;true it thus; "a power to &s;up|pre&s;s di&s;content and commotion, excited by oppre&s;&s;ion, and to &s;u&s;tain the oppre&s;&s;ion." For when did a go|vernment want energy to do ju&s;tice, in times of peace and pro&s;perity? "Submit quietly and peaceably to to the ble&s;&s;ings of an energetic government," is the language of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, whil&s;t he is marching an army into Poland, for the purpo&s;es of plunder and de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>When the&s;e arts are exploded, tho&s;e who by intrigue and deception, have really formed them&s;elves into a pow|erful party, will turn out by right and nature, to be a mere junto, operating upon a whole &s;ociety, for their own &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es. And however their leader, like a young prince, may be flattered with the tongue of inte|re&s;t into a good opinion of him&s;elf; and though his de|pendants may at fir&s;t pa&s;s him upon the world for pro|digious parts and a&s;toni&s;hing integrity; yet manhood in the one, and the effects of the other's policy, will of|ten unma&s;k the deception, and exhibit them as prodi|gies of another &s;ort.</P>
<P>Rai&s;ing up an ari&s;tocracy, and &s;evering the communi|ty into the two orders of nobles and people, is provi|ding a faction to teize and torment the public mind, by perpetual tricks and artifices, for appropriating to them|&s;elves the pur&s;e and power of the nation. This &s;cheme has operated, and is yet operating. The wealth alrea|dy ama&s;&s;ed by &s;pecious frauds, hath produced vi&s;ibly its

natural effects, by corrupting tho&s;e principles of mode|ration and republicani&s;m, which are the only pledge of public liberty and private happine&s;s.</P>
<P>What can the people of any &s;tate gain by ari&s;tocra|tical and paper repre&s;entatives? Decency and cunning in government, is the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible acqui&s;ition. Will a &s;oul be &s;o fooli&s;h, as to tru&s;t in a band and &s;urplice for &s;alvation, or a body &s;o in&s;ane, as to rely for health in a full-bottomed wig? And will a &s;oul, a body, or a nati|on be con&s;oled by the reflection, that it is de&s;troyed <HI>&s;e|cundum artem.</HI></P>
<P>And what can the author gain by &s;ucce&s;s? If he is poor, what is his object? If rich, what influences him? If he is an officer of government, will he gain prefer|ment? If not, does he propo&s;e to erect an office for him&s;elf? Does he favour national profu&s;ion? Or is eco|nomy the language of public rapacity? Will de&s;po|ti&s;m contend for liberty, and <HI>legal</HI> equality? Do his ar|guments inli&s;t him with a party, &s;truggling for <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> gains; or is he telling a &s;alvation of which he can only participate with the community in general? Is he not labouring to defend the con&s;titution again&s;t the mo&s;t fatal attacks, and are not the remedies propo&s;ed of a general, and not a local nature? Whil&s;t he deplores his want of ability and information, equal to a ta&s;k, which no one el&s;e hath undertaken, and &s;olicits a cor|rection of his errors, he boldly a&s;&s;erts, that he is actu|ated by no uncha&s;te de&s;ign, and that he has written in the &s;pirit of truth.</P>
<P>An admini&s;tration without a maxim, would be like a &s;hip without a rudder. From the effects of the con|trivance, and not from its profe&s;&s;ions, is this governing maxim to be collected. Of the following maxims &s;elect the mo&s;t appo&s;ite. <Q>Hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy? Sim|plicity and knowledge pre&s;erve liberty. Divide and conquer. A public debt is a public ble&s;&s;ing.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="027782_0095_0FD640474E843F60">
The model of Nebuchadnezzar's image &s;eems to be the idol of admini&s;tration; but although the head was of gold, and the feet of clay, let it be remembered, that the clay contained a mixture of iron, and that one com|mon cata&s;trophe humbled the gold it&s;elf to the du&s;t.</P>
<P>The natural intere&s;ts, and the hone&s;t politics of the nation will unite, and prevent the erection of an image, which all mu&s;t fall down and wor&s;hip. The attempt to &s;et it up, violates the con&s;titution, and therefore fede|rali&s;m will be &s;trenuous to defend its own work. And even antifederali&s;m will join in the good cau&s;e, &s;ince the principles it profe&s;&s;es are al&s;o violated. The artifi|ces of a party, foment a di&s;union between them, in or|der to dupe and to u&s;e both.</P>
